a, tractor, is, an, engineering, vehicle, specifically, designed, to, deliver, a, high, tractive, effort, or, torque, at, slow, speeds, for, the, purposes, of, hauling, a, trailer, or, machinery, such, as, that, used, in, agriculture, mining, or, construction, most, commonly, the, term, is, used, to, describe, a, farm, vehicle, that, provides, the, power, and, traction, to, mechanize, agricultural, tasks, especially, and, originally, tillage, and, now, many, more, agricultural, implements, may, be, towed, behind, or, mounted, on, the, tractor, and, the, tractor, may, also, provide, a, source, of, power, if, the, implement, is, mechanised, the, word, tractor, was, taken, from, latin, being, the, agent, noun, of, trahere, to, pull, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, meaning, an, engine, or, vehicle, for, pulling, wagons, or, plows, occurred, in, 1896, from, the, earlier, term, traction, motor, 1859, in, the, uk, ireland, australia, india, spain, argentina, slovenia, serbia, croatia, the, netherlands, and, germany, the, word, tractor, usually, means, farm, tractor, and, the, use, of, the, word, tractor, to, mean, other, types, of, vehicles, is, familiar, to, the, vehicle, trade, but, unfamiliar, to, much, of, the, general, public, in, canada, and, the, us, the, word, may, also, refer, to, the, road, tractor, portion, of, a, tractor, trailer, truck, but, also, usually, refers, to, the, piece, of, farm, equipment, the, first, powered, farm, implements, in, the, early, 19th, century, were, portable, engines, steam, engines, on, wheels, that, could, be, used, to, drive, mechanical, farm, machinery, by, way, of, a, flexible, belt, richard, trevithick, designed, the, first, semi, portable, stationary, steam, engine, for, agricultural, use, known, as, a, barn, engine, in, 1812, and, it, was, used, to, drive, a, corn, threshing, machine, the, truly, portable, engine, was, invented, in, 1839, by, william, tuxford, of, boston, lincolnshire, who, started, manufacture, of, an, engine, built, around, a, locomotive, style, boiler, with, horizontal, smoke, tubes, a, large, flywheel, was, mounted, on, the, crankshaft, and, a, stout, leather, belt, was, used, to, transfer, the, drive, to, the, equipment, being, driven, in, the, 1850s, john, fowler, used, a, clayton, shuttleworth, portable, engine, to, drive, apparatus, in, the, first, public, demonstrations, of, the, application, of, cable, haulage, to, cultivation, in, parallel, with, the, early, portable, engine, development, many, engineers, attempted, to, make, them, self, propelled, the, fore, runners, of, the, traction, engine, in, most, cases, this, was, achieved, by, fitting, a, sprocket, on, the, end, of, the, crankshaft, and, running, a, chain, from, this, to, a, larger, sprocket, on, the, rear, axle, these, experiments, met, with, mixed, success, the, first, proper, traction, engine, in, the, form, recognisable, today, was, developed, in, 1859, when, british, engineer, thomas, aveling, modified, a, clayton, shuttleworth, portable, engine, which, had, to, be, hauled, from, job, to, job, by, horses, into, a, self, propelled, one, the, alteration, was, made, by, fitting, a, long, driving, chain, between, the, crankshaft, and, the, rear, axle, the, first, half, of, the, 1860s, was, a, period, of, great, experimentation, but, by, the, end, of, the, decade, the, standard, form, of, the, traction, engine, had, evolved, and, changed, little, over, the, next, sixty, years, it, was, widely, adopted, for, agricultural, use, the, first, tractors, were, steam, powered, plowing, engines, they, were, used, in, pairs, placed, on, either, side, of, a, field, to, haul, a, plow, back, and, forth, between, them, using, a, wire, cable, in, britain, mann, s, and, garrett, developed, steam, tractors, for, direct, ploughing, but, the, heavy, wet, soil, of, england, meant, that, these, designs, were, less, economical, than, a, team, of, horses, in, the, united, states, where, soil, conditions, permitted, steam, tractors, were, used, to, direct, haul, plows, steam, powered, agricultural, engines, remained, in, use, well, into, the, 20th, century, until, reliable, internal, combustion, engines, had, been, developed, the, first, gasoline, powered, tractors, were, built, in, illinois, by, john, charter, combining, single, cylinder, otto, engines, with, a, rumley, steam, engine, chassis, in, 1889, in, 1892, john, froelich, built, a, gasoline, powered, tractor, in, clayton, county, iowa, us, a, van, duzen, single, cylinder, gasoline, engine, was, mounted, on, a, robinson, engine, chassis, which, could, be, controlled, and, propelled, by, froelich, s, gear, box, after, receiving, a, patent, froelich, started, up, the, waterloo, gasoline, engine, company, and, invested, all, of, his, assets, the, venture, was, very, unsuccessful, and, by, 1895, all, was, lost, and, he, went, out, of, business, richard, hornsby, sons, are, credited, with, producing, and, selling, the, first, oil, engined, tractor, in, britain, invented, by, herbert, akroyd, stuart, the, hornsby, akroyd, patent, safety, oil, traction, engine, was, made, in, 1896, with, a, 20, hp, 15, kw, engine, in, 1897, it, was, bought, by, mr, locke, king, the, first, recorded, british, tractor, sale, that, year, it, won, a, silver, medal, from, the, royal, agricultural, society, of, england, it, later, returned, to, the, factory, for, a, caterpillar, track, fitting, the, first, commercially, successful, light, weight, petrol, powered, general, purpose, tractor, was, built, by, dan, albone, a, british, inventor, in, 1901, he, filed, for, a, patent, on, 15, february, 1902, for, his, tractor, design, and, then, formed, ivel, agricultural, motors, limited, the, other, directors, were, selwyn, edge, charles, jarrott, john, hewitt, and, lord, willoughby, he, called, his, machine, the, ivel, agricultural, motor, the, word, tractor, came, into, common, use, after, hart, parr, created, it, the, ivel, agricultural, motor, was, light, powerful, and, compact, it, had, one, front, wheel, with, a, solid, rubber, tyre, and, two, large, rear, wheels, like, a, modern, tractor, the, engine, used, water, cooling, utilizing, the, thermo, syphon, effect, it, had, one, forward, and, one, reverse, gear, a, pulley, wheel, on, the, left, hand, side, allowed, it, to, be, used, as, a, stationary, engine, driving, a, wide, range, of, agricultural, machinery, the, 1903, sale, price, was, 300, his, tractor, won, a, medal, at, the, royal, agricultural, show, in, 1903, and, 1904, about, 500, were, built, and, many, were, exported, all, over, the, world, the, original, engine, was, made, by, payne, co, of, coventry, after, 1906, french, aster, engines, were, used, the, first, successful, american, tractor, was, built, by, charles, w, hart, and, charles, h, parr, they, developed, a, two, cylinder, gasoline, engine, and, set, up, their, business, in, charles, city, iowa, in, 1903, the, firm, built, 15, tractors, their, 14, 000, pounds, 6, 400, kg, 3, is, the, oldest, surviving, internal, combustion, engine, tractor, in, the, united, states, and, is, on, display, at, the, smithsonian, national, museum, of, american, history, in, washington, d, c, the, two, cylinder, engine, has, a, unique, hit, and, miss, firing, cycle, that, produced, 30, hp, 22, kw, at, the, belt, and, 18, hp, 13, kw, at, the, drawbar, in, 1908, the, saunderson, tractor, and, implement, co, of, bedford, introduced, a, four, wheel, design, and, became, the, largest, tractor, manufacturer, in, britain, at, the, time, while, the, earlier, heavier, tractors, were, initially, very, successful, it, became, increasingly, apparent, at, this, time, that, the, weight, of, a, large, supporting, frame, was, less, efficient, than, lighter, designs, henry, ford, introduced, a, light, weight, mass, produced, design, which, largely, displaced, the, heavier, designs, some, companies, halfheartedly, followed, suit, with, mediocre, designs, as, if, to, disprove, the, concept, but, they, were, largely, unsuccessful, in, that, endeavor, while, unpopular, at, first, these, gasoline, powered, machines, began, to, catch, on, in, the, 1910s, when, they, became, smaller, and, more, affordable, henry, ford, introduced, the, fordson, a, wildly, popular, mass, produced, tractor, in, 1917, they, were, built, in, the, u, s, ireland, england, and, russia, and, by, 1923, fordson, had, 77, of, the, u, s, market, the, fordson, dispensed, with, a, frame, using, the, strength, of, the, engine, block, to, hold, the, machine, together, by, the, 1920s, tractors, with, gasoline, powered, internal, combustion, engines, had, become, the, norm, the, first, three, point, hitches, were, experimented, with, in, 1917, after, harry, ferguson, applied, for, a, british, patent, for, his, three, point, hitch, in, 1926, they, became, popular, a, three, point, attachment, of, the, implement, to, the, tractor, is, the, simplest, and, the, only, statically, determinate, way, of, joining, two, bodies, in, engineering, the, ferguson, brown, company, produced, the, model, a, ferguson, brown, tractor, with, a, ferguson, designed, hydraulic, hitch, in, 1938, ferguson, entered, into, a, collaboration, with, henry, ford, to, produce, the, ford, ferguson, 9n, tractor, the, three, point, hitch, soon, became, the, favorite, hitch, attachment, system, among, farmers, around, the, world, this, tractor, model, also, included, a, rear, power, take, off, pto, shaft, that, could, be, used, to, power, three, point, hitch, mounted, implements, such, as, sickle, bar, mowers, in, 1969, general, electric, introduced, the, elec, trak, the, first, commercial, electric, tractor, electric, powered, garden, tractor, the, elec, trak, was, manufactured, by, general, electric, until, 1975, electric, tractors, are, manufactured, by, a, german, company, fendt, and, by, us, companies, solectrac, and, monarch, tractor, john, deere, s, protoype, electric, tractor, is, a, plug, in, powered, by, an, electrical, cable, kubota, is, prototyping, an, autonomous, electric, tractor, tractors, can, be, generally, classified, by, number, of, axles, or, wheels, with, main, categories, of, two, wheel, tractors, single, axle, tractors, and, four, wheel, tractors, two, axle, tractors, more, axles, are, possible, but, uncommon, among, four, wheel, tractors, two, axle, tractors, most, are, two, wheel, drive, usually, at, the, rear, but, many, are, two, wheel, drive, with, front, wheel, assist, four, wheel, drive, often, with, articulated, steering, or, track, crawler, with, steel, or, rubber, tracks, the, classic, farm, tractor, is, a, simple, open, vehicle, with, two, very, large, driving, wheels, on, an, axle, below, a, single, seat, the, seat, and, steering, wheel, consequently, are, in, the, center, and, the, engine, in, front, of, the, driver, with, two, steerable, wheels, below, the, engine, compartment, this, basic, design, has, remained, unchanged, for, a, number, of, years, after, being, pioneered, by, wallis, but, enclosed, cabs, are, fitted, on, almost, all, modern, models, for, operator, safety, and, comfort, in, some, localities, with, heavy, or, wet, soils, notably, in, the, central, valley, of, california, the, caterpillar, or, crawler, type, of, tracked, tractor, became, popular, due, to, superior, traction, and, flotation, these, were, usually, maneuvered, through, the, use, of, turning, brake, pedals, and, separate, track, clutches, operated, by, levers, rather, than, a, steering, wheel, four, wheel, drive, tractors, began, to, appear, in, the, 1960s, some, four, wheel, drive, tractors, have, the, standard, two, large, two, small, configuration, typical, of, smaller, tractors, while, some, have, four, large, powered, wheels, the, larger, tractors, are, typically, an, articulated, center, hinged, design, steered, by, hydraulic, cylinders, that, move, the, forward, power, unit, while, the, trailing, unit, is, not, steered, separately, in, the, early, 21st, century, articulated, or, non, articulated, steerable, multitrack, tractors, have, largely, supplanted, the, caterpillar, type, for, farm, use, larger, types, of, modern, farm, tractors, include, articulated, four, wheel, or, eight, wheel, drive, units, with, one, or, two, power, units, which, are, hinged, in, the, middle, and, steered, by, hydraulic, clutches, or, pumps, a, relatively, recent, development, is, the, replacement, of, wheels, or, steel, crawler, type, tracks, with, flexible, steel, reinforced, rubber, tracks, usually, powered, by, hydrostatic, or, completely, hydraulic, driving, mechanisms, the, configuration, of, these, tractors, bears, little, resemblance, to, the, classic, farm, tractor, design, the, predecessors, of, modern, tractors, traction, engines, used, steam, engines, for, power, since, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, internal, combustion, engines, have, been, the, power, source, of, choice, between, 1900, and, 1960, gasoline, was, the, predominant, fuel, with, kerosene, the, rumely, oil, pull, was, the, most, notable, of, this, kind, being, a, common, alternative, generally, one, engine, could, burn, any, of, those, although, cold, starting, was, easiest, on, gasoline, often, a, small, auxiliary, fuel, tank, was, available, to, hold, gasoline, for, cold, starting, and, warm, up, while, the, main, fuel, tank, held, whatever, fuel, was, most, convenient, or, least, expensive, for, the, particular, farmer, in, the, united, kingdom, a, gasoline, kerosene, engine, is, known, as, a, petrol, paraffin, engine, dieselisation, gained, momentum, starting, in, the, 1960s, and, modern, farm, tractors, usually, employ, diesel, engines, which, range, in, power, output, from, 18, to, 575, horsepower, 15, to, 480, kw, size, and, output, are, dependent, on, application, with, smaller, tractors, used, for, lawn, mowing, landscaping, orchard, work, and, truck, farming, and, larger, tractors, for, vast, fields, of, wheat, corn, soy, and, other, bulk, crops, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, or, propane, also, have, been, used, as, tractor, fuels, but, require, special, pressurized, fuel, tanks, and, filling, equipment, and, produced, less, power, so, are, less, prevalent, in, most, markets, most, are, confined, for, inside, work, due, to, their, clean, burning, during, the, second, world, war, petrolium, based, fuel, was, scarce, in, many, european, nations, so, they, resorted, to, using, wood, gasifires, on, every, vehicle, including, tractors, in, some, countries, such, as, germany, biodiesel, is, often, used, some, other, biofuels, such, as, straight, vegetable, oil, are, also, being, used, by, some, farmers, prototype, battery, powered, electric, tractors, are, being, developed, by, a, german, company, fendt, and, by, two, us, companies, solectrac, and, monarch, tractor, john, deere, s, protoype, electric, tractor, is, a, plug, in, powered, by, an, electrical, cable, kubota, is, prototyping, an, autonomous, electric, tractor, most, older, farm, tractors, use, a, manual, transmission, with, several, gear, ratios, typically, three, to, six, sometimes, multiplied, into, two, or, three, ranges, this, arrangement, provides, a, set, of, discrete, ratios, that, combined, with, the, varying, of, the, throttle, allow, final, drive, speeds, from, less, than, one, up, to, about, 25, miles, per, hour, 40, km, h, with, the, lower, speeds, used, for, working, the, land, and, the, highest, speed, used, on, the, road, slow, controllable, speeds, are, necessary, for, most, of, the, operations, performed, with, a, tractor, they, help, give, the, farmer, a, larger, degree, of, control, in, certain, situations, such, as, field, work, when, travelling, on, public, roads, the, slow, operating, speeds, can, cause, problems, such, as, long, queues, or, tailbacks, which, can, delay, or, annoy, motorists, in, cars, and, trucks, these, motorists, are, responsible, for, being, duly, careful, around, farm, tractors, and, sharing, the, road, with, them, but, many, shirk, this, responsibility, so, various, ways, to, minimize, the, interaction, or, minimize, the, speed, differential, are, employed, where, feasible, some, countries, for, example, the, netherlands, employ, a, road, sign, on, some, roads, that, means, no, farm, tractors, some, modern, tractors, such, as, the, jcb, fastrac, are, now, capable, of, much, higher, road, speeds, of, around, 50, mph, 80, km, h, older, tractors, usually, have, unsynchronized, transmission, designs, which, often, require, the, operator, to, engage, the, clutch, to, shift, between, gears, this, mode, of, use, is, inherently, unsuited, to, some, of, the, work, tractors, do, and, has, been, circumvented, in, various, ways, over, the, years, for, existing, unsynchronized, tractors, the, methods, of, circumvention, are, double, clutching, or, power, shifting, both, of, which, require, the, operator, to, rely, on, skill, to, speed, match, the, gears, while, shifting, and, are, undesirable, from, a, risk, mitigation, standpoint, because, of, what, can, go, wrong, if, the, operator, makes, a, mistake, transmission, damage, is, possible, and, loss, of, vehicle, control, can, occur, if, the, tractor, is, towing, a, heavy, load, either, uphill, or, downhill, something, that, tractors, often, do, therefore, operator, s, manuals, for, most, of, these, tractors, state, one, must, always, stop, the, tractor, before, shifting, in, newer, designs, unsynchronized, transmission, designs, were, replaced, with, synchronization, or, with, continuously, variable, transmissions, cvts, either, a, synchronized, manual, transmission, with, enough, available, gear, ratios, often, achieved, with, dual, ranges, high, and, low, or, a, cvt, allow, the, engine, speed, to, be, matched, to, the, desired, final, drive, speed, while, keeping, engine, speed, within, the, appropriate, speed, as, measured, in, rotations, per, minute, or, rpm, range, for, power, generation, the, working, range, whereas, throttling, back, to, achieve, the, desired, final, drive, speed, is, a, trade, off, that, leaves, the, working, range, the, problems, solutions, and, developments, described, here, also, describe, the, history, of, transmission, evolution, in, semi, trailer, trucks, the, biggest, difference, is, fleet, turnover, whereas, most, of, the, old, road, tractors, have, long, since, been, scrapped, many, of, the, old, farm, tractors, are, still, in, use, therefore, old, transmission, design, and, operation, is, primarily, just, of, historical, interest, in, trucking, whereas, in, farming, it, still, often, affects, daily, life, the, power, produced, by, the, engine, must, be, transmitted, to, the, implement, or, equipment, to, do, the, actual, work, intended, for, the, equipment, this, may, be, accomplished, via, a, drawbar, or, hitch, system, if, the, implement, is, to, be, towed, or, otherwise, pulled, through, the, tractive, power, of, the, engine, or, via, a, pulley, or, power, takeoff, system, if, the, implement, is, stationary, or, a, combination, of, the, two, plows, and, other, tillage, equipment, are, most, commonly, connected, to, the, tractor, via, a, drawbar, the, classic, drawbar, is, simply, a, steel, bar, attached, to, the, tractor, or, in, some, cases, as, in, the, early, fordsons, cast, as, part, of, the, rear, transmission, housing, to, which, the, hitch, of, the, implement, was, attached, with, a, pin, or, by, a, loop, and, clevis, the, implement, could, be, readily, attached, and, removed, allowing, the, tractor, to, be, used, for, other, purposes, on, a, daily, basis, if, the, tractor, was, equipped, with, a, swinging, drawbar, then, it, could, be, set, at, the, center, or, offset, from, center, to, allow, the, tractor, to, run, outside, the, path, of, the, implement, the, drawbar, system, necessitated, the, implement, having, its, own, running, gear, usually, wheels, and, in, the, case, of, a, plow, chisel, cultivator, or, harrow, some, sort, of, lift, mechanism, to, raise, it, out, of, the, ground, at, turns, or, for, transport, drawbars, necessarily, posed, a, rollover, risk, depending, on, how, the, tractive, torque, was, applied, the, fordson, tractor, was, prone, to, roll, backward, due, to, an, excessively, short, wheelbase, the, linkage, between, the, implement, and, the, tractor, usually, had, some, slack, which, could, lead, to, jerky, starts, and, greater, wear, and, tear, on, the, tractor, and, the, equipment, drawbars, were, appropriate, to, the, dawn, of, mechanization, because, they, were, very, simple, in, concept, and, because, as, the, tractor, replaced, the, horse, existing, horse, drawn, implements, usually, already, had, running, gear, as, the, history, of, mechanization, progressed, the, advantages, of, other, hitching, systems, became, apparent, leading, to, new, developments, see, below, depending, on, the, function, for, which, a, tractor, is, used, though, the, drawbar, is, still, one, of, the, usual, means, of, attaching, an, implement, to, a, tractor, see, photo, at, left, some, tractor, manufacturers, produced, matching, equipment, that, could, be, directly, mounted, on, the, tractor, examples, included, front, end, loaders, belly, mowers, row, crop, cultivators, corn, pickers, and, corn, planters, in, most, cases, these, fixed, mounts, were, proprietary, and, unique, to, each, make, of, tractor, so, an, implement, produced, by, john, deere, for, example, could, not, be, attached, to, a, minneapolis, moline, tractor, another, disadvantage, was, mounting, usually, required, some, time, and, labor, resulting, in, the, implement, being, semi, permanently, attached, with, bolts, or, other, mounting, hardware, usually, it, was, impractical, to, remove, the, implement, and, reinstall, it, on, a, day, to, day, basis, as, a, result, the, tractor, was, unavailable, for, other, uses, and, dedicated, to, a, single, use, for, an, appreciable, period, of, time, an, implement, was, generally, mounted, at, the, beginning, of, its, season, of, use, such, as, tillage, planting, or, harvesting, and, removed, when, the, season, ended, the, drawbar, system, was, virtually, the, exclusive, method, of, attaching, implements, other, than, direct, attachment, to, the, tractor, before, harry, ferguson, developed, the, three, point, hitch, equipment, attached, to, the, three, point, hitch, can, be, raised, or, lowered, hydraulically, with, a, control, lever, the, equipment, attached, to, the, three, point, hitch, is, usually, completely, supported, by, the, tractor, another, way, to, attach, an, implement, is, via, a, quick, hitch, which, is, attached, to, the, three, point, hitch, this, enables, a, single, person, to, attach, an, implement, quicker, and, put, the, person, in, less, danger, when, attaching, the, implement, the, three, point, hitch, revolutionized, farm, tractors, and, their, implements, while, the, ferguson, system, was, still, under, patent, other, manufacturers, developed, new, hitching, systems, to, try, to, fend, off, some, of, ferguson, s, competitive, advantage, for, example, international, harvester, s, farmall, tractors, gained, a, two, point, fast, hitch, and, john, deere, had, a, power, lift, that, was, somewhat, similar, to, the, more, flexible, ferguson, invention, once, the, patent, protection, expired, on, the, three, point, hitch, it, became, an, industry, standard, almost, every, tractor, today, features, ferguson, s, three, point, linkage, or, a, derivative, of, it, this, hitch, allows, for, easy, attachment, and, detachment, of, implements, while, allowing, the, implement, to, function, as, a, part, of, the, tractor, almost, as, if, it, were, attached, by, a, fixed, mount, previously, when, the, implement, hit, an, obstacle, the, towing, link, broke, or, the, tractor, flipped, over, ferguson, s, idea, was, to, combine, a, connection, via, two, lower, and, one, upper, lift, arms, that, were, connected, to, a, hydraulic, lifting, ram, the, ram, was, in, turn, connected, to, the, upper, of, the, three, links, so, the, increased, drag, as, when, a, plough, hits, a, rock, caused, the, hydraulics, to, lift, the, implement, until, the, obstacle, was, passed, recently, bobcat, s, patent, on, its, front, loader, connection, inspired, by, these, earlier, systems, has, expired, and, compact, tractors, are, now, being, outfitted, with, quick, connect, attachments, for, their, front, end, loaders, in, addition, to, towing, an, implement, or, supplying, tractive, power, through, the, wheels, most, tractors, have, a, means, to, transfer, power, to, another, machine, such, as, a, baler, swather, or, mower, unless, it, functions, solely, by, pulling, it, through, or, over, the, ground, a, towed, implement, needs, its, own, power, source, such, as, a, baler, or, combine, with, a, separate, engine, or, else, a, means, of, transmitting, power, from, the, tractor, to, the, mechanical, operations, of, the, equipment, early, tractors, used, belts, or, cables, wrapped, around, the, flywheel, or, a, separate, belt, pulley, to, power, stationary, equipment, such, as, a, threshing, machine, buzz, saw, silage, blower, or, stationary, baler, in, most, cases, it, was, impractical, for, the, tractor, and, equipment, to, move, with, a, flexible, belt, or, cable, between, them, so, this, system, required, the, tractor, to, remain, in, one, location, with, the, work, brought, to, the, equipment, or, the, tractor, to, be, relocated, at, each, turn, and, the, power, set, up, reapplied, as, in, cable, drawn, plowing, systems, used, in, early, steam, tractor, operations, modern, tractors, use, a, power, take, off, pto, shaft, to, provide, rotary, power, to, machinery, that, may, be, stationary, or, pulled, the, pto, shaft, generally, is, at, the, rear, of, the, tractor, and, can, be, connected, to, an, implement, that, is, either, towed, by, a, drawbar, or, a, three, point, hitch, this, eliminates, the, need, for, a, separate, implement, mounted, power, source, which, is, almost, never, seen, in, modern, farm, equipment, it, is, also, optional, to, get, a, front, pto, as, well, when, buying, a, new, tractor, virtually, all, modern, tractors, can, also, provide, external, hydraulic, fluid, and, electrical, power, to, the, equipment, they, are, towing, either, by, hoses, or, wires, modern, tractors, have, many, electrical, switches, and, levers, in, the, cab, for, controlling, the, multitude, of, different, functions, available, on, the, tractor, some, modern, farm, tractors, retain, a, traditional, manual, transmission, increasingly, they, have, hydraulically, driven, powershift, transmissions, and, cvt, which, vastly, simplify, operation, those, with, powershift, transmissions, have, identical, pedal, arrangements, on, the, floor, for, the, operator, to, actuate, replacing, a, clutch, pedal, on, the, far, left, with, an, inching, pedal, that, cuts, off, hydraulic, flow, to, the, clutches, twinned, brake, pedals, one, each, for, left, and, right, side, wheels, are, placed, together, on, the, right, side, some, have, a, pedal, for, a, foot, throttle, on, the, far, right, unlike, automobiles, throttle, speed, can, also, be, controlled, by, a, hand, operated, lever, hand, throttle, which, may, be, set, to, a, fixed, position, this, helps, provide, a, constant, speed, in, field, work, it, also, helps, provide, continuous, power, for, stationary, tractors, that, are, operating, an, implement, by, pto, shaft, or, axle, driven, belt, the, foot, throttle, gives, the, operator, more, automobile, like, control, over, the, speed, of, a, mobile, tractor, in, any, operation, some, modern, tractors, also, have, or, offer, as, optional, equipment, a, button, on, the, gear, stick, for, controlling, the, clutch, in, addition, to, the, standard, pedal, allowing, for, gear, changes, and, the, tractor, to, be, brought, to, a, stop, without, using, the, foot, pedal, to, engage, the, clutch, others, have, a, button, for, temporarily, increasing, throttle, speed, to, improve, hydraulic, flow, to, implements, such, as, a, front, end, loader, bucket, independent, left, and, right, brake, pedals, are, provided, to, allow, improved, steering, by, engaging, the, side, one, wishes, to, turn, to, slowing, or, stopping, its, wheel, and, improved, traction, in, soft, and, slippery, conditions, by, transferring, rotation, to, the, wheel, with, better, grip, some, users, prefer, to, lock, both, pedals, together, or, utilize, a, partial, lock, that, allows, the, left, pedal, to, be, depressed, independently, but, engages, both, when, the, right, is, applied, this, may, be, in, the, form, of, a, swinging, or, sliding, bolt, that, may, be, readily, engaged, or, disengaged, in, the, field, without, tools, foot, pedal, throttle, control, is, mostly, a, returning, feature, of, newer, tractors, in, the, uk, foot, pedal, use, to, control, engine, speed, while, travelling, on, the, road, is, mandatory, some, tractors, especially, those, designed, for, row, crop, work, have, a, de, accelerator, pedal, which, operates, in, the, reverse, fashion, of, an, automobile, throttle, slowing, the, engine, when, applied, this, allows, control, over, the, speed, of, a, tractor, with, its, throttle, set, high, for, work, as, when, repeatedly, slowing, to, make, u, turns, at, the, end, of, crop, rows, in, fields, a, front, facing, foot, button, is, traditionally, included, just, ahead, of, the, driver, s, seat, designed, to, be, pressed, by, the, operator, s, heel, to, engage, the, rear, differential, lock, diff, lock, which, prevents, wheel, slip, the, differential, normally, allows, driving, wheels, to, operate, at, their, own, speeds, as, required, for, example, by, the, different, radius, each, takes, in, a, turn, this, allows, the, outside, wheel, to, travel, faster, than, the, inside, wheel, thereby, traveling, further, during, a, turn, in, low, traction, conditions, on, a, soft, surface, the, same, mechanism, can, allow, one, wheel, to, slip, wasting, its, torque, and, further, reducing, traction, the, differential, lock, overrides, this, forcing, both, wheels, to, turn, at, the, same, speed, reducing, wheel, slip, and, improving, traction, care, must, be, taken, to, unlock, the, differential, before, turning, usually, by, hitting, the, pedal, a, second, time, since, the, tractor, with, good, traction, cannot, perform, a, turn, with, the, diff, lock, engaged, in, many, modern, tractors, this, pedal, is, replaced, with, an, electrical, switch, many, functions, once, controlled, with, levers, have, been, replaced, with, some, model, of, electrical, switch, with, the, rise, of, indirect, computer, controlling, of, functions, in, modern, tractors, until, the, late, of, the, 1950s, tractors, had, a, single, register, of, gears, hence, one, gear, stick, often, with, three, to, five, forward, gears, and, one, reverse, then, group, gears, were, introduced, and, another, gear, stick, was, added, later, control, of, the, forward, reverse, direction, was, moved, to, a, special, stick, attached, at, the, side, of, the, steering, wheel, which, allowed, forward, or, reverse, travel, in, any, gear, now, with, cvts, or, other, gear, types, fewer, sticks, control, the, transmission, and, some, are, replaced, with, electrical, switches, or, are, totally, computer, controlled, the, three, point, hitch, was, controlled, with, a, lever, for, adjusting, the, position, or, as, with, the, earliest, ones, just, the, function, for, raising, or, lowering, the, hitch, with, modern, electrical, systems, it, is, often, replaced, with, a, potentiometer, for, the, lower, bound, position, and, another, one, for, the, upper, bound, and, a, switch, allowing, automatic, adjustment, of, the, hitch, between, these, settings, the, external, hydraulics, also, originally, had, levers, but, now, are, often, replaced, with, some, form, of, electrical, switch, the, same, is, true, for, the, power, take, off, shaft, agriculture, in, the, united, states, is, one, of, the, most, hazardous, industries, only, surpassed, by, mining, and, construction, no, other, farm, machine, is, so, identified, with, the, hazards, of, production, agriculture, as, the, tractor, tractor, related, injuries, account, for, approximately, 32, of, the, fatalities, and, 6, of, the, nonfatal, injuries, in, agriculture, over, 50, is, attributed, to, tractor, overturns, the, roll, over, protection, structure, rops, and, seat, belt, when, worn, are, the, most, important, safety, devices, to, protect, operators, from, death, during, tractor, overturns, modern, tractors, have, a, rops, to, prevent, an, operator, from, being, crushed, when, overturning, this, is, especially, important, in, open, air, tractors, where, the, rops, is, a, steel, beam, that, extends, above, the, operator, s, seat, for, tractors, with, operator, cabs, the, rops, is, part, of, the, frame, of, the, cab, a, rops, with, enclosed, cab, further, reduces, the, likelihood, of, serious, injury, because, the, operator, is, protected, by, the, sides, and, windows, of, the, cab, these, structures, were, first, required, by, legislation, in, sweden, in, 1959, before, they, were, required, some, farmers, died, when, their, tractors, rolled, on, top, of, them, row, crop, tractors, before, rops, were, particularly, dangerous, because, of, their, tricycle, design, with, the, two, front, wheels, spaced, close, together, and, angled, inward, toward, the, ground, some, farmers, were, killed, by, rollovers, while, operating, tractors, along, steep, slopes, others, have, been, killed, while, attempting, to, tow, or, pull, an, excessive, load, from, above, axle, height, or, when, cold, weather, caused, the, tires, to, freeze, to, the, ground, in, both, cases, causing, the, tractor, to, pivot, around, the, rear, axle, rops, were, first, required, in, the, united, states, in, 1986, non, retroactively, rops, adoption, by, farmers, is, thus, incomplete, to, treat, this, problem, crops, cost, effective, roll, over, protection, structures, have, been, developed, to, encourage, farmers, to, retrofit, older, tractors, for, the, rops, to, work, as, designed, the, operator, must, stay, within, its, protective, frame, and, wear, the, seat, belt, in, addition, to, rops, u, s, manufacturers, add, instructional, seats, on, tractors, with, enclosed, cabs, the, tractors, have, a, rops, with, seatbelts, for, both, the, operator, and, passenger, this, instructional, seat, is, intended, to, be, used, for, training, new, tractor, operators, but, can, also, be, used, to, diagnose, machine, problems, the, misuse, of, an, instructional, seat, increases, the, likelihood, of, injury, especially, when, children, are, transported, the, international, organization, for, standardization, s, iso, standard, 23205, 2014, specifies, the, minimum, design, and, performance, requirements, for, an, instructional, seat, and, states, that, the, instructional, seat, is, neither, intended, for, nor, is, it, designed, for, use, by, children, despite, this, upwards, of, 40, of, farm, families, give, their, children, rides, on, tractors, often, using, these, instructional, seats, the, most, common, use, of, the, term, tractor, is, for, the, vehicles, used, on, farms, the, farm, tractor, is, used, for, pulling, or, pushing, agricultural, machinery, or, trailers, for, plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and, similar, tasks, a, variety, of, specialty, farm, tractors, have, been, developed, for, particular, uses, these, include, row, crop, tractors, with, adjustable, tread, width, to, allow, the, tractor, to, pass, down, rows, of, cereals, maize, tomatoes, or, other, crops, without, crushing, the, plants, wheatland, or, standard, tractors, with, fixed, wheels, and, a, lower, center, of, gravity, for, plowing, and, other, heavy, field, work, for, broadcast, crops, and, high, crop, tractors, with, adjustable, tread, and, increased, ground, clearance, often, used, in, the, cultivation, of, cotton, and, other, high, growing, row, crop, plant, operations, and, utility, tractors, typically, smaller, tractors, with, a, low, center, of, gravity, and, short, turning, radius, used, for, general, purposes, around, the, farmstead, many, utility, tractors, are, used, for, nonfarm, grading, landscape, maintenance, and, excavation, purposes, particularly, with, loaders, backhoes, pallet, forks, and, similar, devices, small, garden, or, lawn, tractors, designed, for, suburban, and, semirural, gardening, and, landscape, maintenance, are, produced, in, a, variety, of, configurations, and, also, find, numerous, uses, on, a, farmstead, some, farm, type, tractors, are, found, elsewhere, than, on, farms, with, large, universities, gardening, departments, in, public, parks, or, for, highway, workman, use, with, blowtorch, cylinders, strapped, to, the, sides, and, a, pneumatic, drill, air, compressor, permanently, fastened, over, the, power, take, off, these, are, often, fitted, with, grass, turf, tyres, which, are, less, damaging, to, soft, surfaces, than, agricultural, tires, space, technology, has, been, incorporated, into, agriculture, in, the, form, of, gps, devices, and, robust, on, board, computers, installed, as, optional, features, on, farm, tractors, these, technologies, are, used, in, modern, precision, farming, techniques, the, spin, offs, from, the, space, race, have, actually, facilitated, automation, in, plowing, and, the, use, of, autosteer, systems, drone, on, tractors, that, are, manned, but, only, steered, at, the, end, of, a, row, the, idea, being, to, neither, overlap, and, use, more, fuel, nor, leave, streaks, when, performing, jobs, such, as, cultivating, several, tractor, companies, have, also, been, working, on, producing, a, driverless, tractor, the, durability, and, engine, power, of, tractors, made, them, very, suitable, for, engineering, tasks, tractors, can, be, fitted, with, engineering, tools, such, as, dozer, blades, buckets, hoes, rippers, etc, the, most, common, attachments, for, the, front, of, a, tractor, are, dozer, blades, or, buckets, when, attached, to, engineering, tools, the, tractor, is, called, an, engineering, vehicle, a, bulldozer, is, a, track, type, tractor, with, a, blade, attached, in, the, front, and, a, rope, winch, behind, bulldozers, are, very, powerful, tractors, and, have, excellent, ground, hold, as, their, main, tasks, are, to, push, or, drag, bulldozers, have, been, further, modified, over, time, to, evolve, into, new, machines, which, are, capable, of, working, in, ways, that, the, original, bulldozer, can, not, one, example, is, that, loader, tractors, were, created, by, removing, the, blade, and, substituting, a, large, volume, bucket, and, hydraulic, arms, which, can, raise, and, lower, the, bucket, thus, making, it, useful, for, scooping, up, earth, rock, and, similar, loose, material, to, load, it, into, trucks, a, front, loader, or, loader, is, a, tractor, with, an, engineering, tool, which, consists, of, two, hydraulic, powered, arms, on, either, side, of, the, front, engine, compartment, and, a, tilting, implement, this, is, usually, a, wide, open, box, called, a, bucket, but, other, common, attachments, are, a, pallet, fork, and, a, bale, grappler, other, modifications, to, the, original, bulldozer, include, making, the, machine, smaller, to, let, it, operate, in, small, work, areas, where, movement, is, limited, also, tiny, wheeled, loaders, officially, called, skid, steer, loaders, but, nicknamed, bobcat, after, the, original, manufacturer, are, particularly, suited, for, small, excavation, projects, in, confined, areas, the, most, common, variation, of, the, classic, farm, tractor, is, the, backhoe, also, called, a, backhoe, loader, as, the, name, implies, it, has, a, loader, assembly, on, the, front, and, a, backhoe, on, the, back, backhoes, attach, to, a, three, point, hitch, on, farm, or, industrial, tractors, industrial, tractors, are, often, heavier, in, construction, particularly, with, regards, to, the, use, of, a, steel, grill, for, protection, from, rocks, and, the, use, of, construction, tires, when, the, backhoe, is, permanently, attached, the, machine, usually, has, a, seat, that, can, swivel, to, the, rear, to, face, the, hoe, controls, removable, backhoe, attachments, almost, always, have, a, separate, seat, on, the, attachment, backhoe, loaders, are, very, common, and, can, be, used, for, a, wide, variety, of, tasks, construction, small, demolitions, light, transportation, of, building, materials, powering, building, equipment, digging, holes, loading, trucks, breaking, asphalt, and, paving, roads, some, buckets, have, retractable, bottoms, enabling, them, to, empty, their, loads, more, quickly, and, efficiently, buckets, with, retractable, bottoms, are, also, often, used, for, grading, and, scratching, off, sand, the, front, assembly, may, be, a, removable, attachment, or, permanently, mounted, often, the, bucket, can, be, replaced, with, other, devices, or, tools, their, relatively, small, frames, and, precise, controls, make, backhoe, loaders, very, useful, and, common, in, urban, engineering, projects, such, as, construction, and, repairs, in, areas, too, small, for, larger, equipment, their, versatility, and, compact, size, make, them, one, of, the, most, popular, urban, construction, vehicles, in, the, uk, and, ireland, the, word, jcb, is, used, colloquially, as, a, genericized, trademark, for, any, such, type, of, engineering, vehicle, the, term, jcb, now, appears, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, although, it, is, still, legally, a, trademark, of, j, c, bamford, ltd, the, term, digger, is, also, commonly, used, a, compact, utility, tractor, cut, is, a, smaller, version, of, an, agricultural, tractor, but, designed, primarily, for, landscaping, and, estate, management, tasks, rather, than, for, planting, and, harvesting, on, a, commercial, scale, typical, cuts, range, from, 20, 50, hp, 15, 37, kw, with, available, power, take, off, pto, power, ranging, from, 15, 45, hp, 11, 34, kw, cuts, are, often, equipped, with, both, a, mid, mounted, and, a, standard, rear, pto, especially, those, below, 40, hp, 30, kw, the, mid, mount, pto, shaft, typically, rotates, at, near, 2000, rpm, and, is, typically, used, to, power, mid, mount, finish, mowers, front, mounted, snow, blowers, or, front, mounted, rotary, brooms, the, rear, pto, is, standardized, at, 540, rpm, for, the, north, american, markets, but, in, some, parts, of, the, world, a, dual, 540, 1000, rpm, pto, is, standard, and, implements, are, available, for, either, standard, in, those, markets, one, of, the, most, common, attachments, for, a, cut, is, the, front, end, loader, or, fel, like, the, larger, agricultural, tractors, a, cut, will, have, an, adjustable, hydraulically, controlled, three, point, hitch, typically, a, cut, will, have, four, wheel, drive, or, more, correctly, four, wheel, assist, modern, cuts, often, feature, hydrostatic, transmissions, but, many, variants, of, gear, drive, transmissions, are, also, offered, from, low, priced, simple, gear, transmissions, to, synchronized, transmissions, to, advanced, glide, shift, transmissions, all, modern, cuts, feature, government, mandated, roll, over, protection, structures, just, like, agricultural, tractors, the, most, well, known, brands, in, north, america, include, kubota, john, deere, tractor, new, holland, ag, case, farmall, and, massey, ferguson, although, less, common, compact, backhoes, are, often, attached, to, compact, utility, tractors, compact, utility, tractors, require, special, smaller, implements, than, full, sized, agricultural, tractors, very, common, implements, include, the, box, blade, the, grader, blade, the, landscape, rake, the, post, hole, digger, or, post, hole, auger, the, rotary, cutter, slasher, or, a, brush, hog, a, mid, or, rear, mount, finish, mower, a, broadcast, seeder, a, subsoiler, and, the, rototiller, rotary, tiller, in, northern, climates, a, rear, mounted, snow, blower, is, very, common, some, smaller, cut, models, are, available, with, front, mounted, snow, blowers, powered, by, mid, pto, shafts, implement, brands, outnumber, tractor, brands, so, cut, owners, have, a, wide, selection, of, implements, for, small, scale, farming, or, large, scale, gardening, some, planting, and, harvesting, implements, are, sized, for, cuts, one, and, two, row, planting, units, are, commonly, available, as, are, cultivators, sprayers, and, different, types, of, seeders, slit, rotary, and, drop, one, of, the, first, cuts, offered, for, small, farms, of, three, to, 30, acres, and, for, small, jobs, on, larger, farms, was, a, three, wheeled, unit, with, the, rear, wheel, being, the, drive, wheel, offered, by, sears, roebuck, in, 1954, and, priced, at, 598, for, the, basic, model, an, even, smaller, variant, of, the, compact, utility, tractor, is, the, subcompact, utility, tractor, although, these, tractors, are, often, barely, larger, than, a, riding, lawn, mower, these, tractors, have, all, the, same, features, of, a, compact, tractor, such, as, a, three, point, hitch, power, steering, four, wheel, drive, and, front, end, loader, these, tractors, are, generally, marketed, towards, homeowners, who, intend, to, mostly, use, them, for, lawn, mowing, with, the, occasional, light, landscaping, task, the, earliest, tractors, were, called, standard, tractors, and, were, intended, almost, solely, for, plowing, and, harrowing, before, planting, which, were, difficult, tasks, for, humans, and, draft, animals, they, were, characterized, by, a, low, rearward, seating, position, fixed, width, tread, and, low, ground, clearance, these, early, tractors, were, cumbersome, and, ill, suited, to, enter, a, field, of, planted, row, crops, for, weed, control, the, standard, tractor, definition, is, no, longer, in, current, use, however, tractors, with, fixed, wheel, spacing, and, a, low, center, of, gravity, are, well, suited, as, loaders, forklifts, and, backhoes, so, that, the, configuration, continues, in, use, without, the, standard, nomenclature, a, general, purpose, or, row, crop, tractor, is, tailored, specifically, to, the, growing, of, crops, grown, in, rows, and, most, especially, to, cultivating, these, crops, these, tractors, are, universal, machines, capable, of, both, primary, tillage, and, cultivation, of, a, crop, the, row, crop, tractor, category, evolved, rather, than, appearing, overnight, but, the, international, harvester, ih, farmall, is, often, considered, the, first, tractor, of, the, category, some, earlier, tractors, of, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, approached, the, form, factor, from, the, heavier, side, as, did, motorized, cultivators, from, the, lighter, side, but, the, farmall, brought, all, of, the, salient, features, together, into, one, package, with, a, capable, distribution, network, to, ensure, its, commercial, success, in, the, new, form, factor, that, the, farmall, popularized, the, cultivator, was, mounted, in, the, front, so, it, was, easily, visible, additionally, the, tractor, had, a, narrow, front, end, the, front, tires, were, spaced, very, closely, and, angled, in, toward, the, bottom, the, back, wheels, straddled, two, rows, with, their, spacing, adjustable, depending, on, row, spacing, and, the, unit, could, cultivate, four, rows, at, once, where, wide, front, wheels, were, used, they, often, could, be, adjusted, as, well, tractors, with, non, adjustable, spacing, were, called, standard, or, wheatland, and, were, chiefly, meant, for, pulling, plows, or, other, towed, implements, typically, with, a, lower, overall, tractor, height, than, row, crop, models, from, 1924, until, 1963, farmalls, were, the, largest, selling, row, crop, tractors, to, compete, john, deere, designed, the, model, c, which, had, a, wide, front, and, could, cultivate, three, rows, at, once, only, 112, prototypes, were, made, as, deere, realized, it, would, lose, sales, to, farmall, if, its, model, did, less, in, 1928, deere, released, the, model, c, anyway, only, as, the, model, gp, general, purpose, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, model, d, when, ordered, over, the, then, unclear, telephone, oliver, refined, its, row, crop, model, early, in, 1930, until, 1935, the, 18, 27, was, oliver, hart, parr, s, only, row, crop, tractor, many, oliver, row, crop, models, are, referred, to, as, oliver, row, crop, 77, oliver, row, crop, 88, etc, many, early, row, crop, tractors, had, a, tricycle, design, with, two, closely, spaced, front, tires, and, some, even, had, a, single, front, tire, this, made, it, dangerous, to, operate, on, the, side, of, a, steep, hill, as, a, result, many, farmers, died, from, tractor, rollovers, also, early, row, crop, tractors, had, no, rollover, protection, system, rops, meaning, if, the, tractor, flipped, back, the, operator, could, be, crushed, sweden, was, the, first, country, which, passed, legislation, requiring, rops, in, 1959, over, 50, of, tractor, related, injuries, and, deaths, are, attributed, to, tractor, rollover, canadian, agricultural, equipment, manufacturer, versatile, makes, row, crop, tractors, that, are, 265, to, 365, horsepower, 198, to, 272, kw, powered, by, an, 8, 9, liter, cummins, diesel, engine, case, ih, and, new, holland, of, cnh, industrial, both, produce, high, horsepower, front, wheel, assist, row, crop, tractors, with, available, rear, tracks, case, ih, also, has, a, 500, hp, 370, kw, four, wheel, drive, track, system, called, rowtrac, john, deere, has, an, extensive, line, of, available, row, crop, tractors, ranging, from, 140, to, 400, horsepower, 100, to, 300, kw, modern, row, crop, tractors, have, rollover, protection, systems, in, the, form, of, a, reinforced, cab, or, a, roll, bar, garden, tractors, sometimes, called, lawn, tractors, are, small, light, tractors, designed, for, use, in, domestic, gardens, lawns, and, small, estates, lawn, tractors, are, designed, for, cutting, grass, and, snow, removal, while, garden, tractors, are, for, small, property, cultivation, in, the, u, s, the, term, riding, lawn, mower, today, often, is, used, to, refer, to, mid, or, rear, engined, machines, front, engined, tractor, layout, machines, designed, primarily, for, cutting, grass, and, light, towing, are, called, lawn, tractors, heavier, duty, tractors, of, similar, size, are, garden, tractors, garden, tractors, are, capable, of, mounting, a, wider, array, of, attachments, than, lawn, tractors, unlike, lawn, tractors, and, rear, engined, riding, mowers, garden, tractors, are, powered, by, horizontal, crankshaft, engines, with, a, belt, drive, to, transaxle, type, transmissions, usually, of, four, or, five, speeds, although, some, may, also, have, two, speed, reduction, gearboxes, drive, shafts, or, hydrostatic, or, hydraulic, drives, garden, tractors, from, wheel, horse, cub, cadet, economy, power, king, john, deere, massey, ferguson, and, case, ingersoll, are, built, in, this, manner, the, engines, are, generally, one, or, two, cylinder, petrol, gasoline, engines, although, diesel, engine, models, are, also, available, especially, in, europe, typically, diesel, powered, garden, tractors, are, larger, and, heavier, duty, than, gasoline, powered, units, and, compare, more, similarly, to, compact, utility, tractors, visually, the, distinction, between, a, garden, tractor, and, a, lawn, tractor, is, often, hard, to, make, generally, garden, tractors, are, more, sturdily, built, with, stronger, frames, 12, inch, or, larger, wheels, mounted, with, multiple, lugs, most, lawn, tractors, have, a, single, bolt, or, clip, on, the, hub, heavier, transaxles, and, ability, to, accommodate, a, wide, range, of, front, belly, and, rear, mounted, attachments, although, most, people, think, primarily, of, four, wheel, vehicles, when, they, think, of, tractors, a, tractor, may, have, one, or, more, axles, the, key, benefit, is, the, power, itself, which, only, takes, one, axle, to, provide, single, axle, tractors, more, often, called, two, wheel, tractors, or, walk, behind, tractors, have, had, many, users, since, the, introduction, of, the, internal, combustion, engine, tractors, they, tend, to, be, small, and, affordable, this, was, especially, true, before, the, 1960s, when, a, walk, behind, tractor, could, often, be, more, affordable, than, a, two, axle, tractor, of, comparable, power, today, s, compact, utility, tractors, and, advanced, garden, tractors, may, negate, most, of, that, market, advantage, but, two, wheel, tractors, still, have, a, following, especially, among, those, who, already, own, one, countries, where, two, wheel, tractors, are, especially, prevalent, today, include, thailand, china, bangladesh, india, and, other, southeast, asia, countries, most, two, wheel, tractors, today, are, specialty, tractors, made, for, one, purpose, such, as, snow, blowers, push, tillers, and, self, propelled, push, mowers, tractors, tailored, to, use, in, fruit, orchards, typically, have, features, suited, to, passing, under, tree, branches, with, impunity, these, include, a, lower, overall, profile, reduced, tree, branch, snagging, risk, via, underslung, exhaust, pipes, rather, than, smoke, stack, style, exhaust, and, large, sheetmetal, cowlings, and, fairings, that, allow, branches, to, deflect, and, slide, off, rather, than, catch, spark, arrestors, on, the, exhaust, tips, and, often, wire, cages, to, protect, the, operator, from, snags, the, ingenuity, of, farm, mechanics, coupled, in, some, cases, with, oem, or, aftermarket, assistance, has, often, resulted, in, the, conversion, of, automobiles, for, use, as, farm, tractors, in, the, united, states, this, trend, was, especially, strong, from, the, 1910s, through, 1950s, it, began, early, in, the, development, of, vehicles, powered, by, internal, combustion, engines, with, blacksmiths, and, amateur, mechanics, tinkering, in, their, shops, especially, during, the, interwar, period, dozens, of, manufacturers, montgomery, ward, among, them, marketed, aftermarket, kits, for, converting, ford, model, ts, for, use, as, tractors, these, were, sometimes, called, hoover, wagons, during, the, great, depression, although, this, term, was, usually, reserved, for, automobiles, converted, to, horse, drawn, buggy, use, when, gasoline, was, unavailable, or, unaffordable, during, the, same, period, another, common, name, was, doodlebug, after, the, popular, kit, by, the, same, name, ford, even, considered, producing, an, official, optional, kit, many, model, a, fords, also, were, converted, for, this, purpose, in, later, years, some, farm, mechanics, have, been, known, to, convert, more, modern, trucks, or, cars, for, use, as, tractors, more, often, as, curiosities, or, for, recreational, purposes, rather, than, out, of, the, earlier, motives, of, pure, necessity, or, frugality, during, world, war, ii, a, shortage, of, tractors, in, sweden, led, to, the, development, of, the, so, called, epa, tractor, epa, was, a, chain, of, discount, stores, and, it, was, often, used, to, signify, something, lacking, in, quality, an, epa, tractor, was, simply, an, automobile, truck, or, lorry, with, the, passenger, space, cut, off, behind, the, front, seats, equipped, with, two, gearboxes, in, a, row, when, done, to, an, older, car, with, a, ladder, frame, the, result, was, similar, to, a, tractor, and, could, be, used, as, one, after, the, war, it, remained, popular, as, a, way, for, young, people, without, a, driver, s, license, to, own, something, similar, to, a, car, since, it, was, legally, seen, as, a, tractor, it, could, be, driven, from, 16, years, of, age, and, only, required, a, tractor, license, eventually, the, legal, loophole, was, closed, and, no, new, epa, tractors, were, allowed, to, be, made, but, the, remaining, ones, were, still, legal, which, led, to, inflated, prices, and, many, protests, from, people, who, preferred, epa, tractors, to, ordinary, cars, the, swedish, government, eventually, replaced, them, with, the, so, called, a, tractor, which, now, had, its, speed, limited, to, 30, km, h, and, allowed, people, aged, 16, and, older, to, drive, the, cars, with, a, moped, license, the, german, occupation, of, italy, during, world, war, ii, resulted, in, a, severe, shortage, of, mechanized, farm, equipment, the, destruction, of, tractors, was, a, sort, of, scorched, earth, strategy, used, to, reduce, the, independence, of, the, conquered, the, shortage, of, tractors, in, that, area, of, europe, was, the, origin, of, lamborghini, the, war, was, also, the, inspiration, for, dual, purpose, vehicles, such, as, the, land, rover, based, on, the, jeep, the, company, made, a, vehicle, that, combined, pto, tillage, 4wd, and, transportation, in, march, 1975, a, similar, type, of, vehicle, was, introduced, in, sweden, the, a, tractor, the, main, difference, is, an, a, tractor, has, a, top, speed, of, 30, km, h, this, is, usually, done, by, fitting, two, gearboxes, in, a, row, and, only, using, one, the, volvo, duett, was, for, a, long, time, the, primary, choice, for, conversion, to, an, epa, or, a, tractor, but, since, supplies, have, dried, up, other, cars, have, been, used, in, most, cases, another, volvo, the, sfro, is, a, swedish, organization, advocating, homebuilt, and, modified, vehicles, another, type, of, homemade, tractors, are, ones, that, are, fabricated, from, scratch, the, from, scratch, description, is, relative, as, often, individual, components, will, be, repurposed, from, earlier, vehicles, or, machinery, e, g, engines, gearboxes, axle, housings, but, the, tractor, s, overall, chassis, is, essentially, designed, and, built, by, the, owner, e, g, a, frame, is, welded, from, bar, stock, channel, stock, angle, stock, flat, stock, etc, as, with, automobile, conversions, the, heyday, of, this, type, of, tractor, at, least, in, developed, economies, lies, in, the, past, when, there, were, large, populations, of, blue, collar, workers, for, whom, metalworking, and, farming, were, prevalent, parts, of, their, lives, for, example, many, 19th, and, 20th, century, new, england, and, midwestern, machinists, and, factory, workers, had, grown, up, on, farms, backyard, fabrication, was, a, natural, activity, to, them, whereas, it, might, seem, daunting, to, most, people, today, the, term, tractor, us, and, canada, or, tractor, unit, uk, is, also, applied, to, nebraska, tractor, tests, are, tests, mandated, by, the, nebraska, tractor, test, law, and, administered, by, the, university, of, nebraska, that, objectively, test, the, performance, of, all, brands, of, tractors, 40, horsepower, or, more, sold, in, nebraska, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, an, era, of, snake, oil, sales, and, advertising, tactics, the, nebraska, tests, helped, farmers, throughout, north, america, to, see, through, marketing, claims, and, make, informed, buying, decisions, the, tests, continue, today, making, sure, tractors, fulfill, the, manufacturer, s, advertised, claims, some, of, the, many, tractor, manufacturers, and, brands, worldwide, include, in, addition, to, commercial, manufacturers, the, open, source, ecology, group, has, developed, several, working, prototypes, of, an, open, source, hardware, tractor, called, the, lifetrac, as, part, of, its, global, village, construction, set
