a, leap, year, also, known, as, an, intercalary, year, or, bissextile, year, is, a, calendar, year, that, contains, an, additional, day, or, in, the, case, of, a, lunisolar, calendar, a, month, compared, to, a, common, year, the, 366th, day, or, 13th, month, is, added, to, keep, the, calendar, year, synchronised, with, the, astronomical, year, or, seasonal, year, since, astronomical, events, and, seasons, do, not, repeat, in, a, whole, number, of, days, calendars, having, a, constant, number, of, days, each, year, will, unavoidably, drift, over, time, with, respect, to, the, event, that, the, year, is, supposed, to, track, such, as, seasons, by, inserting, intercalating, an, additional, day, a, leap, day, or, month, a, leap, month, into, some, years, the, drift, between, a, civilization, s, dating, system, and, the, physical, properties, of, the, solar, system, can, be, corrected, an, astronomical, year, lasts, slightly, less, than, 365, 1, 4, days, the, historic, julian, calendar, has, three, common, years, of, 365, days, followed, by, a, leap, year, of, 366, days, by, extending, february, to, 29, days, rather, than, the, common, 28, the, gregorian, calendar, the, world, s, most, widely, used, civil, calendar, makes, a, further, adjustment, for, the, small, error, in, the, julian, algorithm, each, leap, year, has, 366, days, instead, of, 365, this, extra, leap, day, occurs, in, each, year, that, is, a, multiple, of, 4, except, for, years, evenly, divisible, by, 100, but, not, by, 400, in, the, lunisolar, hebrew, calendar, adar, aleph, a, 13th, lunar, month, is, added, seven, times, every, 19, years, to, the, twelve, lunar, months, in, its, common, years, to, keep, its, calendar, year, from, drifting, through, the, seasons, in, the, solar, hijri, and, bah, calendars, a, leap, day, is, added, when, needed, to, ensure, that, the, following, year, begins, on, the, march, equinox, the, term, leap, year, probably, comes, from, the, fact, that, a, fixed, date, in, the, gregorian, calendar, normally, advances, one, day, of, the, week, from, one, year, to, the, next, but, the, day, of, the, week, in, the, 12, months, following, the, leap, day, from, 1, march, through, 28, february, of, the, following, year, will, advance, two, days, due, to, the, extra, day, thus, leaping, over, one, day, in, the, week, for, example, 1, march, was, on, a, friday, in, 2024, then, it, will, be, on, saturday, in, 2025, sunday, in, 2026, and, monday, in, 2027, but, then, will, leap, over, tuesday, to, fall, on, a, wednesday, in, 2028, the, length, of, a, day, is, also, occasionally, corrected, by, inserting, a, leap, second, into, coordinated, universal, time, utc, because, of, variations, in, earth, s, rotation, period, unlike, leap, days, leap, seconds, are, not, introduced, on, a, regular, schedule, because, variations, in, the, length, of, the, day, are, not, entirely, predictable, leap, years, can, present, a, problem, in, computing, known, as, the, leap, year, bug, when, a, year, is, not, correctly, identified, as, a, leap, year, or, when, 29, february, is, not, handled, correctly, in, logic, that, accepts, or, manipulates, dates, on, 1, january, 45, bc, by, edict, julius, caesar, reformed, the, historic, roman, calendar, to, make, it, a, consistent, solar, calendar, rather, than, one, which, was, neither, strictly, lunar, nor, strictly, solar, thus, removing, the, need, for, frequent, intercalary, months, his, rule, for, leap, years, was, a, simple, one, add, a, leap, day, every, 4, years, this, algorithm, is, close, to, reality, a, julian, year, lasts, 365, 25, days, a, mean, tropical, year, about, 365, 2422, days, consequently, even, this, julian, calendar, drifts, out, of, true, by, about, 3, days, every, 400, years, the, julian, calendar, continued, in, use, unaltered, for, about, 1600, years, until, the, catholic, church, became, concerned, about, the, widening, divergence, between, the, march, equinox, and, 21, march, as, explained, at, gregorian, calendar, below, prior, to, caesar, s, creation, of, what, would, be, the, julian, calendar, february, was, already, the, shortest, month, of, the, year, for, romans, in, the, roman, calendar, after, the, reform, of, numa, pompilius, that, added, january, and, february, all, months, except, february, had, an, odd, number, of, days, 29, or, 31, this, was, because, of, a, roman, superstition, that, even, numbers, were, unlucky, when, caesar, changed, the, calendar, to, follow, the, solar, year, closely, he, made, all, months, have, 30, or, 31, days, leaving, february, unchanged, except, in, leap, years, in, the, gregorian, calendar, the, standard, calendar, in, most, of, the, world, almost, every, fourth, year, is, a, leap, year, each, leap, year, the, month, of, february, has, 29, days, instead, of, 28, adding, one, extra, day, in, the, calendar, every, 4, years, compensates, for, the, fact, that, a, period, of, 365, days, is, shorter, than, a, tropical, year, by, almost, 6, hours, however, this, correction, is, excessive, and, the, gregorian, reform, modified, the, julian, calendar, s, scheme, of, leap, years, as, follows, every, year, that, is, exactly, divisible, by, four, is, a, leap, year, except, for, years, that, are, exactly, divisible, by, 100, but, these, centurial, years, are, leap, years, if, they, are, exactly, divisible, by, 400, for, example, the, years, 1700, 1800, and, 1900, are, not, leap, years, but, the, years, 1600, and, 2000, are, whereas, the, julian, calendar, year, incorrectly, summarised, earth, s, tropical, year, as, 365, 25, days, the, gregorian, calendar, makes, these, exceptions, to, follow, a, calendar, year, of, 365, 2425, days, this, more, closely, resembles, a, mean, tropical, year, of, 365, 2422, days, over, a, period, of, four, centuries, the, accumulated, error, of, adding, a, leap, day, every, 4, years, amounts, to, about, 3, extra, days, the, gregorian, calendar, therefore, omits, 3, leap, days, every, 400, years, which, is, the, length, of, its, leap, cycle, this, is, done, by, omitting, 29, february, in, the, 3, century, years, multiples, of, 100, that, are, not, multiples, of, 400, the, years, 2000, and, 2400, are, leap, years, but, not, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and, 2300, by, this, rule, an, entire, leap, cycle, is, 400, years, which, total, 146, 097, days, and, the, average, number, of, days, per, year, is, 365, 1, 4, 1, 100, 1, 400, 365, 97, 400, 365, 2425, this, rule, could, be, applied, to, years, before, the, gregorian, reform, to, create, a, proleptic, gregorian, calendar, though, the, result, would, not, match, any, historical, records, the, gregorian, calendar, was, designed, to, keep, the, vernal, equinox, on, or, close, to, 21, march, so, that, the, date, of, easter, celebrated, on, the, sunday, after, the, ecclesiastical, full, moon, that, falls, on, or, after, 21, march, remains, close, to, the, vernal, equinox, the, accuracy, section, of, the, gregorian, calendar, article, discusses, how, well, the, gregorian, calendar, achieves, this, design, goal, and, how, well, it, approximates, the, tropical, year, the, intercalary, day, that, usually, occurs, every, 4, years, is, called, leap, day, and, is, created, by, adding, an, extra, day, to, february, this, day, is, added, to, the, calendar, in, leap, years, as, a, corrective, measure, because, the, earth, does, not, orbit, the, sun, in, precisely, 365, days, since, about, the, 15th, century, this, extra, day, has, been, 29, february, but, when, the, julian, calendar, was, introduced, the, leap, day, was, handled, differently, in, two, respects, first, leap, day, fell, within, february, and, not, at, the, end, 24, february, was, doubled, to, create, strangely, to, modern, eyes, two, days, both, dated, 24, february, second, the, leap, day, was, simply, not, counted, so, that, a, leap, year, still, had, 365, days, the, early, roman, calendar, was, a, lunisolar, one, that, consisted, of, 12, months, for, a, total, of, 355, days, in, addition, a, 27, or, 28, day, intercalary, month, the, mensis, intercalaris, was, sometimes, inserted, into, february, at, the, first, or, second, day, after, the, terminalia, a, d, vii, kal, mar, 23, february, to, resynchronise, the, lunar, and, solar, cycles, the, remaining, days, of, februarius, were, discarded, this, intercalary, month, named, intercalaris, or, mercedonius, contained, 27, days, the, religious, festivals, that, were, normally, celebrated, in, the, last, 5, days, of, february, were, moved, to, the, last, 5, days, of, intercalaris, the, lunisolar, calendar, was, abandoned, about, 450, bc, by, the, decemviri, who, implemented, the, roman, republican, calendar, used, until, 46, bc, the, days, of, these, calendars, were, counted, down, inclusively, to, the, next, named, day, so, 24, february, was, ante, diem, sextum, kalendas, martias, often, abbreviated, a, d, vi, kal, mart, the, romans, counted, days, inclusively, in, their, calendars, so, this, was, the, fifth, day, before, 1, march, when, counted, in, the, modern, exclusive, manner, i, e, not, including, both, the, starting, and, ending, day, because, only, 22, or, 23, days, were, effectively, added, not, a, full, lunation, the, calends, and, ides, of, the, roman, republican, calendar, were, no, longer, associated, with, the, new, moon, and, full, moon, in, caesar, s, revised, calendar, there, was, just, one, intercalary, day, nowadays, called, the, leap, day, to, be, inserted, every, fourth, year, and, this, too, was, done, after, 23, february, to, create, the, intercalary, day, the, existing, ante, diem, sextum, kalendas, martias, sixth, day, inclusive, i, e, what, we, would, call, the, fifth, day, before, before, the, kalends, first, day, of, march, i, e, what, we, would, call, 24, february, was, doubled, producing, ante, diem, bis, sextum, kalendas, martias, this, second, instance, of, the, sixth, day, before, the, kalends, of, march, was, inserted, in, calendars, between, the, normal, fifth, and, sixth, days, by, legal, fiction, the, romans, treated, both, the, first, sixth, day, and, the, additional, sixth, day, before, the, kalends, of, march, as, one, day, thus, a, child, born, on, either, of, those, days, in, a, leap, year, would, have, its, first, birthday, on, the, following, sixth, day, before, the, kalends, of, march, in, a, leap, year, in, the, original, julian, calendar, there, were, indeed, two, days, both, numbered, 24, february, this, practice, continued, for, another, fifteen, to, seventeen, centuries, even, after, most, countries, had, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, for, legal, purposes, the, two, days, of, the, bis, sextum, were, considered, to, be, a, single, day, with, the, second, sixth, being, intercalated, but, in, common, practice, by, the, year, 238, when, censorinus, wrote, the, intercalary, day, was, followed, by, the, last, five, days, of, february, a, d, vi, v, iv, iii, and, pridie, kal, mart, the, days, numbered, 24, 25, 26, 27, and, 28, from, the, beginning, of, february, in, a, common, year, so, that, the, intercalated, day, was, the, first, of, the, doubled, pair, thus, the, intercalated, day, was, effectively, inserted, between, the, 23rd, and, 24th, days, of, february, all, later, writers, including, macrobius, about, 430, bede, in, 725, and, other, medieval, computists, calculators, of, easter, continued, to, state, that, the, bissextum, bissextile, day, occurred, before, the, last, five, days, of, february, in, england, the, church, and, civil, society, continued, the, roman, practice, whereby, the, leap, day, was, simply, not, counted, so, that, a, leap, year, was, only, reckoned, as, 365, days, henry, iii, s, 1236, statute, de, anno, et, die, bissextili, instructed, magistrates, to, treat, the, leap, day, and, the, day, before, as, one, day, the, practical, application, of, the, rule, is, obscure, it, was, regarded, as, in, force, in, the, time, of, the, famous, lawyer, sir, edward, coke, 1552, 1634, because, he, cites, it, in, his, institutes, of, the, lawes, of, england, however, coke, merely, quotes, the, act, with, a, short, translation, and, does, not, give, practical, examples, and, by, b, the, statute, de, anno, bissextili, it, is, provided, quod, computentur, dies, ille, excrescens, et, dies, proxime, pr, cedens, pro, unico, dii, so, as, in, computation, that, day, excrescent, is, not, accounted, replacement, by, 29, february, of, the, awkward, practice, of, having, two, days, with, the, same, date, appears, to, have, evolved, by, custom, and, practice, the, etymological, origin, of, the, term, bissextile, seems, to, have, been, lost, in, england, in, the, fifteenth, century, 29, february, appears, increasingly, often, in, legal, documents, although, the, records, of, the, proceedings, of, the, house, of, commons, of, england, continued, to, use, the, old, system, until, the, middle, of, the, sixteenth, century, it, was, not, until, the, passage, of, the, calendar, new, style, act, 1750, that, 29, february, was, formally, recognised, in, british, law, in, the, liturgical, calendar, of, the, christian, churches, the, placement, of, the, leap, day, is, significant, because, of, the, date, of, the, feast, of, saint, matthias, which, is, defined, as, the, sixth, day, before, 1, march, counting, inclusively, the, church, of, england, s, book, of, common, prayer, was, still, using, the, two, days, with, the, same, date, system, in, its, 1542, edition, it, first, included, a, calendar, which, used, entirely, consecutive, day, counting, from, 1662, and, showed, leap, day, as, falling, on, 29, february, in, the, 1680s, the, church, of, england, declared, 25, february, to, be, the, feast, of, st, matthias, until, 1970, the, roman, catholic, church, always, celebrated, the, feast, of, saint, matthias, on, a, d, vi, kal, mart, so, if, the, days, were, numbered, from, the, beginning, of, the, month, it, was, named, 24, february, in, common, years, but, the, presence, of, the, bissextum, in, a, bissextile, year, immediately, before, a, d, vi, kal, mart, shifted, the, latter, day, to, 25, february, in, leap, years, with, the, vigil, of, st, matthias, shifting, from, 23, february, to, the, leap, day, of, 24, february, this, shift, did, not, take, place, in, pre, reformation, norway, and, iceland, pope, alexander, iii, ruled, that, either, practice, was, lawful, other, feasts, normally, falling, on, 25, 28, february, in, common, years, are, also, shifted, to, the, following, day, in, a, leap, year, although, they, would, be, on, the, same, day, according, to, the, roman, notation, the, practice, is, still, observed, by, those, who, use, the, older, calendars, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, feast, of, st, john, cassian, is, celebrated, on, 29, february, but, he, is, instead, commemorated, at, compline, on, 28, february, in, non, leap, years, the, feast, of, st, matthias, is, celebrated, in, august, so, leap, years, do, not, affect, his, commemoration, and, while, the, feast, of, the, first, and, second, findings, of, the, head, of, john, the, baptist, is, celebrated, on, 24, february, the, orthodox, church, calculates, days, from, the, beginning, of, the, current, month, rather, than, counting, down, days, to, the, kalends, of, the, following, month, this, is, not, affected, thus, only, the, feast, of, st, john, cassian, and, any, movable, feasts, associated, with, the, lenten, or, pre, lenten, cycles, are, affected, in, ireland, and, britain, it, is, a, tradition, that, women, may, propose, marriage, only, in, leap, years, while, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, tradition, was, initiated, by, saint, patrick, or, brigid, of, kildare, in, 5th, century, ireland, this, is, dubious, as, the, tradition, has, not, been, attested, before, the, 19th, century, supposedly, a, 1288, law, by, queen, margaret, of, scotland, then, age, five, and, living, in, norway, required, that, fines, be, levied, if, a, marriage, proposal, was, refused, by, the, man, compensation, was, deemed, to, be, a, pair, of, leather, gloves, a, single, rose, 1, and, a, kiss, in, some, places, the, tradition, was, tightened, to, restricting, female, proposals, to, the, modern, leap, day, 29, february, or, to, the, medieval, bissextile, leap, day, 24, february, according, to, felten, a, play, from, the, turn, of, the, 17th, century, the, maydes, metamorphosis, has, it, that, this, is, leape, year, women, wear, breeches, a, few, hundred, years, later, breeches, wouldn, t, do, at, all, women, looking, to, take, advantage, of, their, opportunity, to, pitch, woo, were, expected, to, wear, a, scarlet, petticoat, fair, warning, if, you, will, in, finland, the, tradition, is, that, if, a, man, refuses, a, woman, s, proposal, on, leap, day, he, should, buy, her, the, fabrics, for, a, skirt, in, france, since, 1980, a, satirical, newspaper, titled, la, bougie, du, sapeur, is, published, only, on, leap, year, on, 29, february, in, greece, marriage, in, a, leap, year, is, considered, unlucky, one, in, five, engaged, couples, in, greece, will, plan, to, avoid, getting, married, in, a, leap, year, in, february, 1988, the, town, of, anthony, texas, declared, itself, the, leap, year, capital, of, the, world, and, an, international, leapling, birthday, club, was, started, a, person, born, on, february, 29, may, be, called, a, leapling, or, a, leaper, in, common, years, they, celebrate, their, birthdays, on, 28, february, or, 1, march, technically, a, leapling, will, have, fewer, birthday, anniversaries, than, their, age, in, years, this, phenomenon, may, be, exploited, for, dramatic, effect, when, a, person, is, declared, to, be, only, a, quarter, of, their, actual, age, by, counting, their, leap, year, birthday, anniversaries, only, for, example, in, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, 1879, comic, opera, the, pirates, of, penzance, frederic, the, pirate, apprentice, discovers, that, he, is, bound, to, serve, the, pirates, until, his, 21st, birthday, that, is, when, he, turns, 88, years, old, since, 1900, was, not, a, leap, year, rather, than, until, his, 21st, year, for, legal, purposes, legal, birthdays, depend, on, how, local, laws, count, time, intervals, the, civil, code, of, taiwan, since, 10, october, 1929, implies, that, the, legal, birthday, of, a, leapling, is, 28, february, in, common, years, if, a, period, fixed, by, weeks, months, and, years, does, not, commence, from, the, beginning, of, a, week, month, or, year, it, ends, with, the, ending, of, the, day, which, precedes, the, day, of, the, last, week, month, or, year, which, corresponds, to, that, on, which, it, began, to, commence, but, if, there, is, no, corresponding, day, in, the, last, month, the, period, ends, with, the, ending, of, the, last, day, of, the, last, month, since, 1990, non, retroactively, hong, kong, considers, the, legal, birthday, of, a, leapling, 1, march, in, common, years, in, the, uk, 1, march, is, considered, to, be, a, leapling, s, legal, birthday, the, revised, julian, calendar, adds, an, extra, day, to, february, in, years, that, are, multiples, of, four, except, for, years, that, are, multiples, of, 100, that, do, not, leave, a, remainder, of, 200, or, 600, when, divided, by, 900, this, rule, agrees, with, the, rule, for, the, gregorian, calendar, until, 2799, the, first, year, that, dates, in, the, revised, julian, calendar, will, not, agree, with, those, in, the, gregorian, calendar, will, be, 2800, because, it, will, be, a, leap, year, in, the, gregorian, calendar, but, not, in, the, revised, julian, calendar, this, rule, gives, an, average, year, length, of, 365, 242222, days, this, is, a, very, good, approximation, to, the, mean, tropical, year, but, because, the, vernal, equinox, year, is, slightly, longer, the, revised, julian, calendar, for, the, time, being, does, not, do, as, good, a, job, as, the, gregorian, calendar, at, keeping, the, vernal, equinox, on, or, close, to, 21, march, the, bah, calendar, is, a, solar, calendar, composed, of, 19, months, of, 19, days, each, 361, days, years, begin, at, naw, r, z, on, the, vernal, equinox, on, or, about, 21, march, a, period, of, intercalary, days, called, ayyam, i, ha, is, inserted, before, the, 19th, month, this, period, normally, has, 4, days, but, an, extra, day, is, added, when, needed, to, ensure, that, the, following, year, starts, on, the, vernal, equinox, this, is, calculated, and, known, years, in, advance, the, revised, bengali, calendar, of, bangladesh, and, the, indian, national, calendar, organise, their, leap, years, so, that, every, leap, day, is, close, to, 29, february, in, the, gregorian, calendar, and, vice, versa, this, makes, it, easy, to, convert, dates, to, or, from, gregorian, the, thai, solar, calendar, uses, the, buddhist, era, be, but, has, been, synchronised, with, the, gregorian, since, ad, 1941, the, chinese, calendar, is, lunisolar, so, a, leap, year, has, an, extra, month, often, called, an, embolismic, month, after, the, greek, word, for, it, in, the, chinese, calendar, the, leap, month, is, added, according, to, a, rule, which, ensures, that, month, 11, is, always, the, month, that, contains, the, northern, winter, solstice, the, intercalary, month, takes, the, same, number, as, the, preceding, month, for, example, if, it, follows, the, second, month, then, it, is, simply, called, leap, second, month, i, e, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, r, n, ryu, the, hebrew, calendar, is, lunisolar, with, an, embolismic, month, this, extra, month, is, called, adar, rishon, first, adar, and, is, added, before, adar, which, then, becomes, adar, sheini, second, adar, according, to, the, metonic, cycle, this, is, done, seven, times, every, nineteen, years, specifically, in, years, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and, 19, this, is, to, ensure, that, passover, pesah, is, always, in, the, spring, as, required, by, the, torah, pentateuch, in, many, verses, relating, to, passover, in, addition, the, hebrew, calendar, has, postponement, rules, that, postpone, the, start, of, the, year, by, one, or, two, days, these, postponement, rules, reduce, the, number, of, different, combinations, of, year, length, and, starting, days, of, the, week, from, 28, to, 14, and, regulate, the, location, of, certain, religious, holidays, in, relation, to, the, sabbath, in, particular, the, first, day, of, the, hebrew, year, can, never, be, sunday, wednesday, or, friday, this, rule, is, known, in, hebrew, as, lo, adu, rosh, i, e, rosh, is, not, sunday, wednesday, or, friday, as, the, hebrew, word, adu, is, written, by, three, hebrew, letters, signifying, sunday, wednesday, and, friday, accordingly, the, first, day, of, passover, is, never, monday, wednesday, or, friday, this, rule, is, known, in, hebrew, as, lo, badu, pesah, which, has, a, double, meaning, passover, is, not, a, legend, but, also, passover, is, not, monday, wednesday, or, friday, as, the, hebrew, word, badu, is, written, by, three, hebrew, letters, signifying, monday, wednesday, and, friday, one, reason, for, this, rule, is, that, yom, kippur, the, holiest, day, in, the, hebrew, calendar, and, the, tenth, day, of, the, hebrew, year, now, must, never, be, adjacent, to, the, weekly, sabbath, which, is, saturday, i, e, it, must, never, fall, on, friday, or, sunday, in, order, not, to, have, two, adjacent, sabbath, days, however, yom, kippur, can, still, be, on, saturday, a, second, reason, is, that, hoshana, rabbah, the, 21st, day, of, the, hebrew, year, will, never, be, on, saturday, these, rules, for, the, feasts, do, not, apply, to, the, years, from, the, creation, to, the, deliverance, of, the, hebrews, from, egypt, under, moses, it, was, at, that, time, cf, exodus, 13, that, the, god, of, abraham, isaac, and, jacob, gave, the, hebrews, their, law, including, the, days, to, be, kept, holy, and, the, feast, days, and, sabbaths, years, consisting, of, 12, months, have, between, 353, and, 355, days, in, a, k, sidra, in, order, 354, day, year, months, have, alternating, 30, and, 29, day, lengths, in, a, chaser, lacking, year, the, month, of, kislev, is, reduced, to, 29, days, in, a, malei, filled, year, the, month, of, marcheshvan, is, increased, to, 30, days, 13, month, years, follow, the, same, pattern, with, the, addition, of, the, 30, day, adar, alef, giving, them, between, 383, and, 385, days, the, observed, and, calculated, versions, of, the, lunar, islamic, calendar, do, not, have, regular, leap, days, even, though, both, have, lunar, months, containing, 29, or, 30, days, generally, in, alternating, order, however, the, tabular, islamic, calendar, used, by, islamic, astronomers, during, the, middle, ages, and, still, used, by, some, muslims, does, have, a, regular, leap, day, added, to, the, last, month, of, the, lunar, year, in, 11, years, of, a, 30, year, cycle, this, additional, day, is, found, at, the, end, of, the, last, month, dhu, al, hijjah, which, is, also, the, month, of, the, hajj, the, solar, hijri, calendar, is, the, modern, iranian, calendar, it, is, an, observational, calendar, that, starts, on, the, spring, equinox, northern, hemisphere, and, adds, a, single, intercalated, day, to, the, last, month, esfand, once, every, 4, or, 5, years, the, first, leap, year, occurs, as, the, fifth, year, of, the, typical, 33, year, cycle, and, the, remaining, leap, years, occur, every, 4, years, through, the, remainder, of, the, 33, year, cycle, this, system, has, less, periodic, deviation, or, jitter, from, its, mean, year, than, the, gregorian, calendar, and, operates, on, the, simple, rule, that, new, year, s, day, must, fall, in, the, 24, hours, of, the, vernal, equinox, the, 33, year, period, is, not, completely, regular, every, so, often, the, 33, year, cycle, will, be, broken, by, a, cycle, of, 29, years, the, hijri, shamsi, calendar, also, adopted, by, the, ahmadiyya, community, is, based, on, solar, calculations, and, is, similar, to, the, gregorian, calendar, in, its, structure, with, the, exception, that, its, epoch, is, the, hijra, the, coptic, calendar, has, 13, months, 12, of, 30, days, each, and, one, at, the, end, of, the, year, of, 5, days, or, 6, days, in, leap, years, the, coptic, leap, year, follows, the, same, rules, as, the, julian, calendar, so, that, the, extra, month, always, has, 6, days, in, the, year, before, a, julian, leap, year, the, ethiopian, calendar, has, 12, months, of, 30, days, plus, 5, or, 6, epagomenal, days, which, comprise, a, 13th, month
