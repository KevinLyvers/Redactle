chemical, engineering, is, an, engineering, field, which, deals, with, the, study, of, the, operation, and, design, of, chemical, plants, as, well, as, methods, of, improving, production, chemical, engineers, develop, economical, commercial, processes, to, convert, raw, materials, into, useful, products, chemical, engineering, uses, principles, of, chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and, economics, to, efficiently, use, produce, design, transport, and, transform, energy, and, materials, the, work, of, chemical, engineers, can, range, from, the, utilization, of, nanotechnology, and, nanomaterials, in, the, laboratory, to, large, scale, industrial, processes, that, convert, chemicals, raw, materials, living, cells, microorganisms, and, energy, into, useful, forms, and, products, chemical, engineers, are, involved, in, many, aspects, of, plant, design, and, operation, including, safety, and, hazard, assessments, process, design, and, analysis, modeling, control, engineering, chemical, reaction, engineering, nuclear, engineering, biological, engineering, construction, specification, and, operating, instructions, chemical, engineers, typically, hold, a, degree, in, chemical, engineering, or, process, engineering, practicing, engineers, may, have, professional, certification, and, be, accredited, members, of, a, professional, body, such, bodies, include, the, institution, of, chemical, engineers, icheme, or, the, american, institute, of, chemical, engineers, aiche, a, degree, in, chemical, engineering, is, directly, linked, with, all, of, the, other, engineering, disciplines, to, various, extents, a, 1996, article, cites, james, f, donnelly, for, mentioning, an, 1839, reference, to, chemical, engineering, in, relation, to, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, in, the, same, paper, however, george, e, davis, an, english, consultant, was, credited, with, having, coined, the, term, davis, also, tried, to, found, a, society, of, chemical, engineering, but, instead, it, was, named, the, society, of, chemical, industry, 1881, with, davis, as, its, first, secretary, the, history, of, science, in, united, states, an, encyclopedia, puts, the, use, of, the, term, around, 1890, chemical, engineering, describing, the, use, of, mechanical, equipment, in, the, chemical, industry, became, common, vocabulary, in, england, after, 1850, by, 1910, the, profession, chemical, engineer, was, already, in, common, use, in, britain, and, the, united, states, in, the, 1940s, it, became, clear, that, unit, operations, alone, were, insufficient, in, developing, chemical, reactors, while, the, predominance, of, unit, operations, in, chemical, engineering, courses, in, britain, and, the, united, states, continued, until, the, 1960s, transport, phenomena, started, to, receive, greater, focus, along, with, other, novel, concepts, such, as, process, systems, engineering, pse, a, second, paradigm, was, defined, transport, phenomena, gave, an, analytical, approach, to, chemical, engineering, while, pse, focused, on, its, synthetic, elements, such, as, those, of, a, control, system, and, process, design, developments, in, chemical, engineering, before, and, after, world, war, ii, were, mainly, incited, by, the, petrochemical, industry, however, advances, in, other, fields, were, made, as, well, advancements, in, biochemical, engineering, in, the, 1940s, for, example, found, application, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, and, allowed, for, the, mass, production, of, various, antibiotics, including, penicillin, and, streptomycin, meanwhile, progress, in, polymer, science, in, the, 1950s, paved, way, for, the, age, of, plastics, concerns, regarding, large, scale, chemical, manufacturing, facilities, safety, and, environmental, impact, were, also, raised, during, this, period, silent, spring, published, in, 1962, alerted, its, readers, to, the, harmful, effects, of, ddt, a, potent, insecticide, the, 1974, flixborough, disaster, in, the, united, kingdom, resulted, in, 28, deaths, as, well, as, damage, to, a, chemical, plant, and, three, nearby, villages, 1984, bhopal, disaster, in, india, resulted, in, almost, 4, 000, deaths, these, incidents, along, with, other, incidents, affected, the, reputation, of, the, trade, as, industrial, safety, and, environmental, protection, were, given, more, focus, in, response, the, icheme, required, safety, to, be, part, of, every, degree, course, that, it, accredited, after, 1982, by, the, 1970s, legislation, and, monitoring, agencies, were, instituted, in, various, countries, such, as, france, germany, and, the, united, states, in, time, the, systematic, application, of, safety, principles, to, chemical, and, other, process, plants, began, to, be, considered, a, specific, discipline, known, as, process, safety, advancements, in, computer, science, found, applications, for, designing, and, managing, plants, simplifying, calculations, and, drawings, that, previously, had, to, be, done, manually, the, completion, of, the, human, genome, project, is, also, seen, as, a, major, development, not, only, advancing, chemical, engineering, but, genetic, engineering, and, genomics, as, well, chemical, engineering, principles, were, used, to, produce, dna, sequences, in, large, quantities, chemical, engineering, involves, the, application, of, several, principles, key, concepts, are, presented, below, chemical, engineering, design, concerns, the, creation, of, plans, specifications, and, economic, analyses, for, pilot, plants, new, plants, or, plant, modifications, design, engineers, often, work, in, a, consulting, role, designing, plants, to, meet, clients, needs, design, is, limited, by, several, factors, including, funding, government, regulations, and, safety, standards, these, constraints, dictate, a, plant, s, choice, of, process, materials, and, equipment, plant, construction, is, coordinated, by, project, engineers, and, project, managers, depending, on, the, size, of, the, investment, a, chemical, engineer, may, do, the, job, of, project, engineer, full, time, or, part, of, the, time, which, requires, additional, training, and, job, skills, or, act, as, a, consultant, to, the, project, group, in, the, usa, the, education, of, chemical, engineering, graduates, from, the, baccalaureate, programs, accredited, by, abet, do, not, usually, stress, project, engineering, education, which, can, be, obtained, by, specialized, training, as, electives, or, from, graduate, programs, project, engineering, jobs, are, some, of, the, largest, employers, for, chemical, engineers, a, unit, operation, is, a, physical, step, in, an, individual, chemical, engineering, process, unit, operations, such, as, crystallization, filtration, drying, and, evaporation, are, used, to, prepare, reactants, purifying, and, separating, its, products, recycling, unspent, reactants, and, controlling, energy, transfer, in, reactors, on, the, other, hand, a, unit, process, is, the, chemical, equivalent, of, a, unit, operation, along, with, unit, operations, unit, processes, constitute, a, process, operation, unit, processes, such, as, nitration, hydrogenation, and, oxidation, involve, the, conversion, of, materials, by, biochemical, thermochemical, and, other, means, chemical, engineers, responsible, for, these, are, called, process, engineers, process, design, requires, the, definition, of, equipment, types, and, sizes, as, well, as, how, they, are, connected, and, the, materials, of, construction, details, are, often, printed, on, a, process, flow, diagram, which, is, used, to, control, the, capacity, and, reliability, of, a, new, or, existing, chemical, factory, education, for, chemical, engineers, in, the, first, college, degree, 3, or, 4, years, of, study, stresses, the, principles, and, practices, of, process, design, the, same, skills, are, used, in, existing, chemical, plants, to, evaluate, the, efficiency, and, make, recommendations, for, improvements, modeling, and, analysis, of, transport, phenomena, is, essential, for, many, industrial, applications, transport, phenomena, involve, fluid, dynamics, heat, transfer, and, mass, transfer, which, are, governed, mainly, by, momentum, transfer, energy, transfer, and, transport, of, chemical, species, respectively, models, often, involve, separate, considerations, for, macroscopic, microscopic, and, molecular, level, phenomena, modeling, of, transport, phenomena, therefore, requires, an, understanding, of, applied, mathematics, chemical, engineers, develop, economic, ways, of, using, materials, and, energy, chemical, engineers, use, chemistry, and, engineering, to, turn, raw, materials, into, usable, products, such, as, medicine, petrochemicals, and, plastics, on, a, large, scale, industrial, setting, they, are, also, involved, in, waste, management, and, research, both, applied, and, research, facets, could, make, extensive, use, of, computers, chemical, engineers, may, be, involved, in, industry, or, university, research, where, they, are, tasked, with, designing, and, performing, experiments, by, scaling, up, theoretical, chemical, reactions, to, create, better, and, safer, methods, for, production, pollution, control, and, resource, conservation, they, may, be, involved, in,
