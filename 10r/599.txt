glasses, also, known, as, eyeglasses, and, spectacles, are, vision, eyewear, with, clear, or, tinted, lenses, mounted, in, a, frame, that, holds, them, in, front, of, a, person, s, eyes, typically, utilizing, a, bridge, over, the, nose, and, hinged, arms, known, as, temples, or, temple, pieces, that, rest, over, the, ears, glasses, are, typically, used, for, vision, correction, such, as, with, reading, glasses, and, glasses, used, for, nearsightedness, however, without, the, specialized, lenses, they, are, sometimes, used, for, cosmetic, purposes, safety, glasses, provide, eye, protection, against, flying, debris, for, construction, workers, or, lab, technicians, these, glasses, may, have, protection, on, the, sides, of, the, eyes, as, well, as, in, the, lenses, some, types, of, safety, glasses, are, used, to, protect, against, visible, and, near, visible, light, or, radiation, glasses, are, worn, for, eye, protection, in, some, sports, such, as, squash, glasses, wearers, may, use, a, strap, to, prevent, the, glasses, from, falling, off, wearers, of, glasses, that, are, used, only, part, of, the, time, may, have, the, glasses, attached, to, a, cord, that, goes, around, their, neck, to, prevent, the, loss, and, breaking, of, the, glasses, sunglasses, allow, for, better, vision, in, bright, daylight, and, are, used, to, protect, one, s, eyes, against, damage, from, excessive, levels, of, ultraviolet, light, typical, sunglasses, lenses, are, tinted, for, protection, against, bright, light, or, polarized, to, remove, glare, photochromic, glasses, are, clear, or, lightly, tinted, in, dark, or, indoor, conditions, but, turn, into, sunglasses, when, they, come, into, contact, with, ultraviolet, light, most, over, the, counter, sunglasses, do, not, have, corrective, power, in, the, lenses, however, special, prescription, sunglasses, can, be, made, people, with, conditions, that, have, photophobia, as, a, primary, symptom, like, certain, migraine, disorders, often, wear, sunglasses, or, precision, tinted, glasses, even, indoors, and, at, night, specialized, glasses, may, be, used, for, viewing, specific, visual, information, for, example, 3d, glasses, for, 3d, films, stereoscopy, sometimes, glasses, are, worn, purely, for, fashion, or, aesthetic, purposes, even, with, glasses, used, for, vision, correction, a, wide, range, of, fashions, are, available, using, plastic, metal, wire, and, other, materials, for, frames, glasses, can, be, marked, or, found, by, their, primary, function, but, also, appear, in, combinations, such, as, prescription, sunglasses, or, safety, glasses, with, enhanced, magnification, corrective, lenses, are, used, to, correct, refractive, errors, by, bending, the, light, entering, the, eye, in, order, to, alleviate, the, effects, of, conditions, such, as, nearsightedness, myopia, farsightedness, hypermetropia, or, astigmatism, the, ability, of, one, s, eyes, to, accommodate, their, focus, to, near, and, distant, focus, alters, over, time, a, common, condition, in, people, over, forty, years, old, is, presbyopia, which, is, caused, by, the, eye, s, crystalline, lens, losing, elasticity, progressively, reducing, the, ability, of, the, lens, to, accommodate, i, e, to, focus, on, objects, close, to, the, eye, few, people, have, a, pair, of, eyes, that, show, exactly, equal, refractive, characteristics, one, eye, may, need, a, stronger, i, e, more, refracting, lens, than, the, other, corrective, lenses, bring, the, image, back, into, focus, on, the, retina, they, are, made, to, conform, to, the, prescription, of, an, ophthalmologist, or, optometrist, a, lensmeter, can, be, used, to, verify, the, specifications, of, an, existing, pair, of, glasses, corrective, eyeglasses, can, significantly, improve, the, life, quality, of, the, wearer, not, only, do, they, enhance, the, wearer, s, visual, experience, but, can, also, reduce, problems, that, result, from, eye, strain, such, as, headaches, or, squinting, the, most, common, type, of, corrective, lens, is, single, vision, which, has, a, uniform, refractive, index, for, people, with, presbyopia, and, hyperopia, bifocal, and, trifocal, glasses, provide, two, or, three, different, refractive, indices, respectively, and, progressive, lenses, have, a, continuous, gradient, lenses, can, also, be, manufactured, with, high, refractive, indices, which, allow, them, to, be, more, lightweight, and, thinner, than, their, counterparts, with, low, refractive, indices, reading, glasses, provide, a, separate, set, of, glasses, for, focusing, on, close, by, objects, reading, glasses, are, available, without, prescription, from, drugstores, and, offer, a, cheap, practical, solution, though, these, have, a, pair, of, simple, lenses, of, equal, power, and, so, will, not, correct, refraction, problems, like, astigmatism, or, refractive, or, prismatic, variations, between, the, left, and, right, eye, for, the, total, correction, of, the, individual, s, sight, glasses, complying, to, a, recent, ophthalmic, prescription, are, required, people, who, need, glasses, to, see, often, have, corrective, lens, restrictions, on, their, driver, s, licenses, that, require, them, to, wear, their, glasses, every, time, they, drive, or, risk, fines, or, jail, time, some, militaries, issue, prescription, glasses, to, servicemen, and, women, these, are, typically, gi, glasses, many, state, prisons, in, the, united, states, issue, glasses, to, inmates, often, in, the, form, of, clear, plastic, aviators, adjustable, focus, eyeglasses, might, be, used, to, replace, bifocals, or, trifocals, or, might, be, used, to, produce, cheaper, single, vision, glasses, since, they, do, not, have, to, be, custom, manufactured, for, every, person, pinhole, glasses, are, a, type, of, corrective, glasses, that, do, not, use, a, lens, pinhole, glasses, do, not, actually, refract, the, light, or, change, focal, length, instead, they, create, a, diffraction, limited, system, which, has, an, increased, depth, of, field, similar, to, using, a, small, aperture, in, photography, this, form, of, correction, has, many, limitations, that, prevent, it, from, gaining, popularity, in, everyday, use, pinhole, glasses, can, be, made, in, a, diy, fashion, by, making, small, holes, in, a, piece, of, card, which, is, then, held, in, front, of, the, eyes, with, a, strap, or, cardboard, arms, safety, glasses, are, worn, to, protect, the, eyes, in, various, situations, they, are, made, with, break, proof, plastic, lenses, to, protect, the, eye, from, flying, debris, or, other, matter, construction, workers, factory, workers, machinists, and, lab, technicians, are, often, required, to, wear, safety, glasses, to, shield, the, eyes, from, flying, debris, or, hazardous, splatters, such, as, blood, or, chemicals, as, of, 2017, dentists, and, surgeons, in, canada, and, other, countries, are, required, to, wear, safety, glasses, to, protect, against, infection, from, patients, blood, or, other, body, fluids, there, are, also, safety, glasses, for, welding, which, are, styled, like, wraparound, sunglasses, but, with, much, darker, lenses, for, use, in, welding, where, a, full, sized, welding, helmet, is, inconvenient, or, uncomfortable, these, are, often, called, flash, goggles, because, they, provide, protection, from, welding, flash, nylon, frames, are, usually, used, for, protective, eyewear, for, sports, because, of, their, lightweight, and, flexible, properties, unlike, most, regular, glasses, safety, glasses, often, include, protection, beside, the, eyes, as, well, as, in, front, of, the, eyes, sunglasses, provide, more, comfort, and, protection, against, bright, light, and, often, against, ultraviolet, uv, light, to, properly, protect, the, eyes, from, the, dangers, of, uv, light, sunglasses, should, have, uv, 400, blocker, to, provide, good, coverage, against, the, entire, light, spectrum, that, poses, a, danger, light, polarization, is, an, added, feature, that, can, be, applied, to, sunglass, lenses, polarization, filters, are, positioned, to, remove, horizontally, polarized, rays, of, light, which, eliminates, glare, from, horizontal, surfaces, allowing, wearers, to, see, into, water, when, reflected, light, would, otherwise, overwhelm, the, scene, polarized, sunglasses, may, present, some, difficulties, for, pilots, since, reflections, from, water, and, other, structures, often, used, to, gauge, altitude, may, be, removed, liquid, crystal, displays, emit, polarized, light, making, them, sometimes, difficult, to, view, with, polarized, sunglasses, sunglasses, may, be, worn, for, aesthetic, purposes, or, simply, to, hide, the, eyes, examples, of, sunglasses, that, were, popular, for, these, reasons, include, tea, shades, and, mirrorshades, many, blind, people, wear, nearly, opaque, glasses, to, hide, their, eyes, for, cosmetic, reasons, many, people, with, light, sensitivity, conditions, wear, sunglasses, or, other, tinted, glasses, to, make, the, light, more, tolerable, sunglasses, may, also, have, corrective, lenses, which, requires, a, prescription, clip, on, sunglasses, or, sunglass, clips, can, be, attached, to, another, pair, of, glasses, some, wrap, around, sunglasses, are, large, enough, to, be, worn, over, another, pair, of, glasses, otherwise, many, people, opt, to, wear, contact, lenses, to, correct, their, vision, so, that, standard, sunglasses, can, be, used, the, double, frame, uplifting, glasses, have, one, moving, frame, with, one, pair, of, lenses, and, the, basic, fixed, frame, with, another, pair, of, lenses, optional, that, are, connected, by, four, bar, linkage, for, example, sun, lenses, could, be, easily, lifted, up, and, down, while, mixed, with, myopia, lenses, that, always, stay, on, presbyopia, lenses, could, be, also, combined, and, easily, removed, from, the, field, of, view, if, needed, without, taking, off, glasses, these, glasses, often, used, for, driver, when, they, went, through, tunnels, the, upper, frame, sunglasses, and, the, second, frame, with, transparent, lenses, drivers, flip, the, sunglasses, in, tunnels, while, driving, the, illusion, of, three, dimensions, on, a, two, dimensional, surface, can, be, created, by, providing, each, eye, with, different, visual, information, 3d, glasses, create, the, illusion, of, three, dimensions, by, filtering, a, signal, containing, information, for, both, eyes, the, signal, often, light, reflected, off, a, movie, screen, or, emitted, from, an, electronic, display, is, filtered, so, that, each, eye, receives, a, slightly, different, image, the, filters, only, work, for, the, type, of, signal, they, were, designed, for, anaglyph, 3d, glasses, have, a, different, colored, filter, for, each, eye, typically, red, and, blue, or, red, and, green, a, polarized, 3d, system, on, the, other, hand, uses, polarized, filters, polarized, 3d, glasses, allow, for, color, 3d, while, the, red, blue, lenses, produce, an, image, with, distorted, coloration, an, active, shutter, 3d, system, uses, electronic, shutters, head, mounted, displays, can, filter, the, signal, electronically, and, then, transmit, light, directly, into, the, viewer, s, eyes, anaglyph, and, polarized, glasses, are, distributed, to, audiences, at, 3d, movies, polarized, and, active, shutter, glasses, are, used, with, many, home, theaters, head, mounted, displays, are, used, by, a, single, person, but, the, input, signal, can, be, shared, between, multiple, units, glasses, can, also, provide, magnification, that, is, useful, for, people, with, vision, impairments, or, specific, occupational, demands, an, example, would, be, bioptics, or, bioptic, telescopes, which, have, small, telescopes, mounted, on, in, or, behind, their, regular, lenses, newer, designs, use, smaller, lightweight, telescopes, which, can, be, embedded, into, the, corrective, glass, and, improve, aesthetic, appearance, mini, telescopic, spectacles, they, may, take, the, form, of, self, contained, glasses, that, resemble, goggles, or, binoculars, or, may, be, attached, to, existing, glasses, yellow, tinted, glasses, are, a, type, of, glasses, with, a, minor, yellow, tint, they, perform, a, slight, color, correction, on, top, of, reducing, eyestrain, from, lack, of, blinking, they, may, also, be, considered, minor, corrective, non, prescription, glasses, depending, on, the, company, these, computer, or, gaming, glasses, can, also, filter, out, high, energy, blue, and, ultra, violet, light, from, lcd, screens, fluorescent, lighting, and, other, sources, of, light, this, allows, for, reduced, eye, strain, these, glasses, can, be, ordered, as, standard, or, prescription, lenses, that, fit, into, standard, optical, frames, by, the, end, of, the, 2010s, eyeglasses, that, filter, out, blue, light, from, computers, smartphones, and, tablets, are, becoming, increasingly, popular, in, response, to, concerns, about, problems, caused, by, blue, light, overexposure, the, problems, claimed, range, from, dry, eyes, to, eye, strain, sleep, cycle, disruption, up, to, macular, degeneration, which, can, cause, partial, blindness, they, may, also, block, out, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, however, there, is, no, measurable, uv, light, from, computer, monitors, the, problem, of, computer, vision, syndrome, cvs, can, result, from, focusing, the, eyes, on, a, screen, for, long, continuous, periods, many, times, the, glasses, do, not, appear, to, have, much, of, a, tint, or, if, any, a, slight, yellow, tint, but, they, may, be, more, heavily, tinted, long, hours, of, computer, use, not, blue, light, may, cause, eye, strain, many, eye, symptoms, caused, by, computer, use, will, lessen, after, the, usage, of, the, computer, is, stopped, decreasing, evening, screen, time, and, setting, devices, to, night, mode, will, improve, sleep, several, studies, have, shown, that, blue, light, from, computers, does, not, lead, to, eye, diseases, including, macular, degeneration, the, total, amount, of, light, entering, the, eyes, can, be, adjusted, without, glasses, using, the, screen, brightness, settings, similarly, the, blue, light, can, often, specifically, be, adjusted, using, the, night, mode, of, different, operating, systems, which, can, usually, be, activated, outside, of, nighttime, hours, the, american, academy, of, ophthalmology, aao, does, not, recommend, special, eyewear, for, computer, use, although, it, recommends, using, prescription, glasses, measured, specifically, for, computer, screen, distance, depending, on, individuals, but, possibly, 20, 26, inches, from, the, face, which, are, not, the, same, as, blue, light, blocking, glasses, the, position, of, the, college, of, optometrists, uk, is, that, the, best, scientific, evidence, currently, available, does, not, support, the, use, of, blue, blocking, spectacle, lenses, in, the, general, population, to, improve, visual, performance, alleviate, the, symptoms, of, eye, fatigue, or, visual, discomfort, improve, sleep, quality, or, conserve, macula, health, the, ophthalmic, frame, is, the, part, of, a, pair, of, glasses, that, is, designed, to, hold, the, lenses, in, the, proper, position, ophthalmic, frames, come, in, a, variety, of, styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and, colors, various, metals, and, alloys, may, be, used, to, make, glasses, such, as, gold, silver, aluminum, beryllium, stainless, steel, titanium, monel, and, nickel, titanium, natural, materials, such, as, wood, bone, ivory, leather, and, semi, precious, or, precious, stones, may, also, be, used, corrective, lenses, can, be, produced, in, many, different, shapes, from, a, circular, lens, called, a, lens, blank, lens, blanks, are, cut, to, fit, the, shape, of, the, frame, that, will, hold, them, frame, styles, vary, and, fashion, trends, change, over, time, resulting, in, a, multitude, of, lens, shapes, for, lower, power, lenses, there, are, few, restrictions, allowing, for, many, trendy, and, fashionable, shapes, higher, power, lenses, can, distort, peripheral, vision, and, may, become, thick, and, heavy, if, a, large, lens, shape, is, used, however, if, the, lens, is, too, small, it, can, drastically, reduce, the, field, of, view, bifocal, trifocal, and, progressive, lenses, generally, require, a, taller, lens, shape, to, leave, room, for, the, different, segments, while, preserving, an, adequate, field, of, view, through, each, segment, frames, with, rounded, edges, are, the, most, efficient, for, correcting, myopic, prescriptions, with, perfectly, round, frames, being, the, most, efficient, before, the, advent, of, eyeglasses, as, a, fashion, item, when, frames, were, constructed, with, only, functionality, in, mind, virtually, all, eyeglasses, were, either, round, oval, panto, rectangular, octagonal, or, square, it, was, not, until, glasses, began, to, be, seen, as, an, accessory, that, different, shapes, were, introduced, to, be, more, aesthetically, pleasing, than, functional, scattered, evidence, exists, for, use, of, visual, aid, devices, in, greek, and, roman, times, most, prominently, the, use, of, an, emerald, by, emperor, nero, as, mentioned, by, pliny, the, elder, the, use, of, a, convex, lens, to, form, an, enlarged, magnified, image, was, most, likely, described, in, ptolemy, s, optics, which, survives, only, in, a, poor, arabic, translation, ptolemy, s, description, of, lenses, was, commented, upon, and, improved, by, ibn, sahl, 10th, century, and, most, notably, by, alhazen, book, of, optics, c, 1021, latin, translations, of, ptolemy, s, optics, and, of, alhazen, became, available, in, europe, in, the, 12th, century, coinciding, with, the, development, of, reading, stones, there, are, claims, that, single, lens, magnifying, glasses, were, being, used, in, china, during, the, northern, song, dynasty, 960, 1127, robert, grosseteste, s, treatise, de, iride, on, the, rainbow, written, between, 1220, and, 1235, mentions, using, optics, to, read, the, smallest, letters, at, incredible, distances, a, few, years, later, in, 1262, roger, bacon, is, also, known, to, have, written, on, the, magnifying, properties, of, lenses, the, development, of, the, first, eyeglasses, took, place, in, northern, italy, in, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, independently, of, the, development, of, optical, lenses, some, cultures, developed, sunglasses, for, eye, protection, without, any, corrective, properties, for, example, flat, panes, of, smoky, quartz, were, used, in, 12th, century, china, and, the, inuit, have, used, snow, goggles, for, eye, protection, the, earliest, recorded, comment, on, the, use, of, lenses, for, optical, purposes, was, made, in, 1268, by, roger, bacon, the, first, eyeglasses, were, estimated, to, have, been, made, in, central, italy, most, likely, in, pisa, or, florence, by, about, 1290, in, a, sermon, delivered, on, 23, february, 1306, the, dominican, friar, giordano, da, pisa, c, 1255, 1311, wrote, it, is, not, yet, twenty, years, since, there, was, found, the, art, of, making, eyeglasses, which, make, for, good, vision, and, it, is, so, short, a, time, that, this, new, art, never, before, extant, was, discovered, i, saw, the, one, who, first, discovered, and, practiced, it, and, i, talked, to, him, giordano, s, colleague, friar, alessandro, della, spina, of, pisa, d, 1313, was, soon, making, eyeglasses, the, ancient, chronicle, of, the, dominican, monastery, of, st, catherine, in, pisa, records, eyeglasses, having, first, been, made, by, someone, else, who, was, unwilling, to, share, them, he, made, them, and, shared, them, with, everyone, with, a, cheerful, and, willing, heart, venice, quickly, became, an, important, center, of, manufacture, especially, due, to, using, the, high, quality, glass, made, at, murano, by, 1301, there, were, guild, regulations, in, venice, governing, the, sale, of, eyeglasses, and, a, separate, guild, of, venetian, spectacle, makers, was, formed, in, 1320, in, the, fourteenth, century, they, were, very, common, objects, francesco, petrarca, says, in, one, of, his, letters, that, until, he, was, 60, he, did, not, need, glasses, and, franco, sacchetti, mentions, them, often, in, his, trecentonovelle, the, earliest, pictorial, evidence, for, the, use, of, eyeglasses, is, tommaso, da, modena, s, 1352, portrait, of, the, cardinal, hugh, de, saint, cher, reading, in, a, scriptorium, another, early, example, would, be, a, depiction, of, eyeglasses, found, north, of, the, alps, in, an, altarpiece, of, the, church, of, bad, wildungen, germany, in, 1403, these, early, glasses, had, convex, lenses, that, could, correct, both, hyperopia, farsightedness, and, the, presbyopia, that, commonly, develops, as, a, symptom, of, aging, although, concave, lenses, for, myopia, near, sightedness, had, made, their, first, appearance, in, the, mid, 15th, century, it, was, not, until, 1604, that, johannes, kepler, published, the, first, correct, explanation, as, to, why, convex, and, concave, lenses, could, correct, presbyopia, and, myopia, early, frames, for, glasses, consisted, of, two, magnifying, glasses, riveted, together, by, the, handles, so, that, they, could, grip, the, nose, these, are, referred, to, as, rivet, spectacles, the, earliest, surviving, examples, were, found, under, the, floorboards, at, kloster, wienhausen, a, convent, near, celle, in, germany, they, have, been, dated, to, circa, 1400, the, world, s, first, specialist, shop, for, spectacles, what, we, might, regard, today, as, an, optician, opened, in, strasbourg, then, holy, roman, empire, now, france, in, 1466, the, 17th, century, claim, by, francesco, redi, that, salvino, degli, armati, of, florence, invented, eyeglasses, in, the, 13th, century, has, been, exposed, as, erroneous, marco, polo, is, mistakenly, claimed, to, have, encountered, eyeglasses, during, his, travels, in, china, in, the, 13th, century, however, no, such, evidence, appears, in, his, accounts, indeed, the, earliest, mentions, of, eyeglasses, in, china, occur, in, the, 15th, century, and, those, chinese, sources, state, that, eyeglasses, were, imported, in, 1907, professor, berthold, laufer, speculated, in, his, history, of, glasses, that, for, glasses, to, be, mentioned, in, the, literature, of, china, and, europe, at, approximately, the, same, time, it, was, probable, that, they, were, not, invented, independently, and, after, ruling, out, the, turks, proposed, india, as, a, location, however, joseph, needham, speculated, that, the, mention, of, glasses, in, the, chinese, manuscript, laufer, used, in, part, to, credit, the, prior, invention, of, them, in, asia, did, not, exist, in, older, versions, of, that, manuscript, and, the, reference, to, them, in, later, versions, was, added, during, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1971, rishi, agarwal, in, an, article, in, the, british, journal, of, ophthalmology, states, that, vyasatirtha, was, observed, in, possession, of, a, pair, of, glasses, in, the, 1520s, he, argues, that, it, is, therefore, most, likely, that, the, use, of, lenses, reached, europe, via, the, arabs, as, did, hindu, mathematics, and, the, ophthalmological, works, of, the, ancient, hindu, surgeon, sushruta, but, all, dates, are, given, well, after, the, existence, of, eyeglasses, in, italy, was, established, including, significant, shipments, of, eyeglasses, from, italy, to, the, middle, east, with, one, shipment, as, large, as, 24, 000, glasses, as, well, as, a, spectacles, dispensary, in, strasbourg, in, 1466, the, american, scientist, benjamin, franklin, who, had, both, myopia, and, presbyopia, invented, bifocals, historians, have, from, time, to, time, produced, evidence, to, suggest, that, others, may, have, preceded, him, in, the, invention, however, a, correspondence, between, george, whatley, and, john, fenno, editor, of, the, gazette, of, the, united, states, suggested, that, franklin, had, indeed, invented, bifocals, and, perhaps, 50, years, earlier, than, had, been, originally, thought, the, first, lenses, for, correcting, astigmatism, were, designed, by, the, british, astronomer, george, airy, in, 1825, over, time, the, construction, of, frames, for, glasses, also, evolved, early, eyepieces, were, designed, to, be, either, held, in, place, by, hand, or, by, exerting, pressure, on, the, nose, pince, nez, girolamo, savonarola, suggested, that, eyepieces, could, be, held, in, place, by, a, ribbon, passed, over, the, wearer, s, head, this, in, turn, secured, by, the, weight, of, a, hat, the, modern, style, of, glasses, held, by, temples, passing, over, the, ears, was, developed, sometime, before, 1727, possibly, by, the, british, optician, edward, scarlett, these, designs, were, not, immediately, successful, however, and, various, styles, with, attached, handles, such, as, scissors, glasses, and, lorgnettes, were, also, fashionable, from, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, into, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, early, 20th, century, moritz, von, rohr, and, zeiss, with, the, assistance, of, h, boegehold, and, a, sonnefeld, developed, the, zeiss, punktal, spherical, point, focus, lenses, that, dominated, the, eyeglass, lens, field, for, many, years, in, 2008, joshua, silver, designed, eyewear, with, adjustable, corrective, glasses, they, work, by, using, a, built, in, syringe, to, pump, a, silicone, solution, into, a, flexible, lens, despite, the, popularity, of, contact, lenses, and, laser, corrective, eye, surgery, glasses, remain, very, common, as, their, technology, has, improved, for, instance, it, is, now, possible, to, purchase, frames, made, of, special, memory, metal, alloys, that, return, to, their, correct, shape, after, being, bent, other, frames, have, spring, loaded, hinges, either, of, these, designs, offer, dramatically, better, ability, to, withstand, the, stresses, of, daily, wear, and, the, occasional, accident, modern, frames, are, also, often, made, from, strong, lightweight, materials, such, as, titanium, alloys, which, were, not, available, in, earlier, times, in, the, 1930s, spectacles, were, described, as, medical, appliances, wearing, spectacles, was, sometimes, considered, socially, humiliating, in, the, 1970s, fashionable, glasses,

as, far, as, possible, and, prefer, to, prove, by, means, of, new, material, from, chinese, literature, that, the, view, of, the, original, invention, of, spectacles, in, india, is, the, greatest,

particular, crystal, spectacles, appear, in, the, european, middle, ages, in, india, and, in, china, and, from, the, historical, point, of, view, one, can, suppose, from, the, outset, that, these, inventions, did, not, occur, independently, in, each, of, these, three, cultural, groups, but, that, a, historical, connection, is, here, present
