a, clock, or, chronometer, is, a, device, that, measures, and, displays, time, the, clock, is, one, of, the, oldest, human, inventions, meeting, the, need, to, measure, intervals, of, time, shorter, than, the, natural, units, such, as, the, day, the, lunar, month, and, the, year, devices, operating, on, several, physical, processes, have, been, used, over, the, millennia, some, predecessors, to, the, modern, clock, may, be, considered, clocks, that, are, based, on, movement, in, nature, a, sundial, shows, the, time, by, displaying, the, position, of, a, shadow, on, a, flat, surface, there, is, a, range, of, duration, timers, a, well, known, example, being, the, hourglass, water, clocks, along, with, sundials, are, possibly, the, oldest, time, measuring, instruments, a, major, advance, occurred, with, the, invention, of, the, verge, escapement, which, made, possible, the, first, mechanical, clocks, around, 1300, in, europe, which, kept, time, with, oscillating, timekeepers, like, balance, wheels, traditionally, in, horology, the, study, of, timekeeping, the, term, clock, was, used, for, a, striking, clock, while, a, clock, that, did, not, strike, the, hours, audibly, was, called, a, timepiece, this, distinction, is, not, generally, made, any, longer, watches, and, other, timepieces, that, can, be, carried, on, one, s, person, are, usually, not, referred, to, as, clocks, spring, driven, clocks, appeared, during, the, 15th, century, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, clockmaking, flourished, the, next, development, in, accuracy, occurred, after, 1656, with, the, invention, of, the, pendulum, clock, by, christiaan, huygens, a, major, stimulus, to, improving, the, accuracy, and, reliability, of, clocks, was, the, importance, of, precise, time, keeping, for, navigation, the, mechanism, of, a, timepiece, with, a, series, of, gears, driven, by, a, spring, or, weights, is, referred, to, as, clockwork, the, term, is, used, by, extension, for, a, similar, mechanism, not, used, in, a, timepiece, the, electric, clock, was, patented, in, 1840, and, electronic, clocks, were, introduced, in, the, 20th, century, becoming, widespread, with, the, development, of, small, battery, powered, semiconductor, devices, the, timekeeping, element, in, every, modern, clock, is, a, harmonic, oscillator, a, physical, object, resonator, that, vibrates, or, oscillates, at, a, particular, frequency, this, object, can, be, a, pendulum, a, balance, wheel, a, tuning, fork, a, quartz, crystal, or, the, vibration, of, electrons, in, atoms, as, they, emit, microwaves, the, last, of, which, is, so, precise, that, it, serves, as, the, definition, of, the, second, clocks, have, different, ways, of, displaying, the, time, analog, clocks, indicate, time, with, a, traditional, clock, face, and, moving, hands, digital, clocks, display, a, numeric, representation, of, time, two, numbering, systems, are, in, use, 12, hour, time, notation, and, 24, hour, notation, most, digital, clocks, use, electronic, mechanisms, and, lcd, led, or, vfd, displays, for, the, blind, and, for, use, over, telephones, speaking, clocks, state, the, time, audibly, in, words, there, are, also, clocks, for, the, blind, that, have, displays, that, can, be, read, by, touch, the, word, clock, derives, from, the, medieval, latin, word, for, bell, clocca, and, has, cognates, in, many, european, languages, clocks, spread, to, england, from, the, low, countries, so, the, english, word, came, from, the, middle, low, german, and, middle, dutch, klocke, the, word, derives, from, the, middle, english, clokke, old, north, french, cloque, or, middle, dutch, clocke, all, of, which, mean, bell, the, apparent, position, of, the, sun, in, the, sky, changes, over, the, course, of, each, day, reflecting, the, rotation, of, the, earth, shadows, cast, by, stationary, objects, move, correspondingly, so, their, positions, can, be, used, to, indicate, the, time, of, day, a, sundial, shows, the, time, by, displaying, the, position, of, a, shadow, on, a, usually, flat, surface, that, has, markings, that, correspond, to, the, hours, sundials, can, be, horizontal, vertical, or, in, other, orientations, sundials, were, widely, used, in, ancient, times, with, knowledge, of, latitude, a, well, constructed, sundial, can, measure, local, solar, time, with, reasonable, accuracy, within, a, minute, or, two, sundials, continued, to, be, used, to, monitor, the, performance, of, clocks, until, the, 1830s, when, the, use, of, the, telegraph, and, trains, standardized, time, and, time, zones, between, cities, many, devices, can, be, used, to, mark, the, passage, of, time, without, respect, to, reference, time, time, of, day, hours, minutes, etc, and, can, be, useful, for, measuring, duration, or, intervals, examples, of, such, duration, timers, are, candle, clocks, incense, clocks, and, the, hourglass, both, the, candle, clock, and, the, incense, clock, work, on, the, same, principle, wherein, the, consumption, of, resources, is, more, or, less, constant, allowing, reasonably, precise, and, repeatable, estimates, of, time, passages, in, the, hourglass, fine, sand, pouring, through, a, tiny, hole, at, a, constant, rate, indicates, an, arbitrary, predetermined, passage, of, time, the, resource, is, not, consumed, but, re, used, water, clocks, along, with, sundials, are, possibly, the, oldest, time, measuring, instruments, with, the, only, exception, being, the, day, counting, tally, stick, given, their, great, antiquity, where, and, when, they, first, existed, is, not, known, and, is, perhaps, unknowable, the, bowl, shaped, outflow, is, the, simplest, form, of, a, water, clock, and, is, known, to, have, existed, in, babylon, and, egypt, around, the, 16th, century, bc, other, regions, of, the, world, including, india, and, china, also, have, early, evidence, of, water, clocks, but, the, earliest, dates, are, less, certain, some, authors, however, write, about, water, clocks, appearing, as, early, as, 4000, bc, in, these, regions, of, the, world, the, macedonian, astronomer, andronicus, of, cyrrhus, supervised, the, construction, of, the, tower, of, the, winds, in, athens, in, the, 1st, century, bc, which, housed, a, large, clepsydra, inside, as, well, as, multiple, prominent, sundials, outside, allowing, it, to, function, as, a, kind, of, early, clocktower, the, greek, and, roman, civilizations, advanced, water, clock, design, with, improved, accuracy, these, advances, were, passed, on, through, byzantine, and, islamic, times, eventually, making, their, way, back, to, europe, independently, the, chinese, developed, their, own, advanced, water, clocks, by, 725, ad, passing, their, ideas, on, to, korea, and, japan, some, water, clock, designs, were, developed, independently, and, some, knowledge, was, transferred, through, the, spread, of, trade, pre, modern, societies, do, not, have, the, same, precise, timekeeping, requirements, that, exist, in, modern, industrial, societies, where, every, hour, of, work, or, rest, is, monitored, and, work, may, start, or, finish, at, any, time, regardless, of, external, conditions, instead, water, clocks, in, ancient, societies, were, used, mainly, for, astrological, reasons, these, early, water, clocks, were, calibrated, with, a, sundial, while, never, reaching, the, level, of, accuracy, of, a, modern, timepiece, the, water, clock, was, the, most, accurate, and, commonly, used, timekeeping, device, for, millennia, until, it, was, replaced, by, the, more, accurate, pendulum, clock, in, 17th, century, europe, islamic, civilization, is, credited, with, further, advancing, the, accuracy, of, clocks, through, elaborate, engineering, in, 797, or, possibly, 801, the, abbasid, caliph, of, baghdad, harun, al, rashid, presented, charlemagne, with, an, asian, elephant, named, abul, abbas, together, with, a, particularly, elaborate, example, of, a, water, clock, pope, sylvester, ii, introduced, clocks, to, northern, and, western, europe, around, 1000, ad, the, first, known, geared, clock, was, invented, by, the, great, mathematician, physicist, and, engineer, archimedes, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, archimedes, created, his, astronomical, clock, which, was, also, a, cuckoo, clock, with, birds, singing, and, moving, every, hour, it, is, the, first, carillon, clock, as, it, plays, music, simultaneously, with, a, person, blinking, his, eyes, surprised, by, the, singing, birds, the, archimedes, clock, works, with, a, system, of, four, weights, counterweights, and, strings, regulated, by, a, system, of, floats, in, a, water, container, with, siphons, that, regulate, the, automatic, continuation, of, the, clock, the, principles, of, this, type, of, clock, are, described, by, the, mathematician, and, physicist, hero, who, says, that, some, of, them, work, with, a, chain, that, turns, a, gear, in, the, mechanism, another, greek, clock, probably, constructed, at, the, time, of, alexander, was, in, gaza, as, described, by, procopius, the, gaza, clock, was, probably, a, meteoroskopeion, i, e, a, building, showing, celestial, phenomena, and, the, time, it, had, a, pointer, for, the, time, and, some, automations, similar, to, the, archimedes, clock, there, were, 12, doors, opening, one, every, hour, with, hercules, performing, his, labors, the, lion, at, one, o, clock, etc, and, at, night, a, lamp, becomes, visible, every, hour, with, 12, windows, opening, to, show, the, time, the, tang, dynasty, buddhist, monk, yi, xing, along, with, government, official, liang, lingzan, made, the, escapement, in, 723, or, 725, to, the, workings, of, a, water, powered, armillary, sphere, and, clock, drive, which, was, the, world, s, first, clockwork, escapement, the, song, dynasty, polymath, and, genius, su, song, 1020, 1101, incorporated, it, into, his, monumental, innovation, of, the, astronomical, clock, tower, of, kaifeng, in, 1088, his, astronomical, clock, and, rotating, armillary, sphere, still, relied, on, the, use, of, either, flowing, water, during, the, spring, summer, and, autumn, seasons, or, liquid, mercury, during, the, freezing, temperatures, of, winter, i, e, hydraulics, in, su, song, s, waterwheel, linkwork, device, the, action, of, the, escapement, s, arrest, and, release, was, achieved, by, gravity, exerted, periodically, as, the, continuous, flow, of, liquid, filled, containers, of, a, limited, size, in, a, single, line, of, evolution, su, song, s, clock, therefore, united, the, concepts, of, the, clepsydra, and, the, mechanical, clock, into, one, device, run, by, mechanics, and, hydraulics, in, his, memorial, su, song, wrote, about, this, concept, according, to, your, servant, s, opinion, there, have, been, many, systems, and, designs, for, astronomical, instruments, during, past, dynasties, all, differing, from, one, another, in, minor, respects, but, the, principle, of, the, use, of, water, power, for, the, driving, mechanism, has, always, been, the, same, the, heavens, move, without, ceasing, but, so, also, does, water, flow, and, fall, thus, if, the, water, is, made, to, pour, with, perfect, evenness, then, the, comparison, of, the, rotary, movements, of, the, heavens, and, the, machine, will, show, no, discrepancy, or, contradiction, for, the, unresting, follows, the, unceasing, song, was, also, strongly, influenced, by, the, earlier, armillary, sphere, created, by, zhang, sixun, 976, ad, who, also, employed, the, escapement, mechanism, and, used, liquid, mercury, instead, of, water, in, the, waterwheel, of, his, astronomical, clock, tower, the, mechanical, clockworks, for, su, song, s, astronomical, tower, featured, a, great, driving, wheel, that, was, 11, feet, in, diameter, carrying, 36, scoops, into, each, of, which, water, was, poured, at, a, uniform, rate, from, the, constant, level, tank, the, main, driving, shaft, of, iron, with, its, cylindrical, necks, supported, on, iron, crescent, shaped, bearings, ended, in, a, pinion, which, engaged, a, gear, wheel, at, the, lower, end, of, the, main, vertical, transmission, shaft, this, great, astronomical, hydromechanical, clock, tower, was, about, ten, metres, high, about, 30, feet, featured, a, clock, escapement, and, was, indirectly, powered, by, a, rotating, wheel, either, with, falling, water, or, liquid, mercury, a, full, sized, working, replica, of, su, song, s, clock, exists, in, the, republic, of, china, taiwan, s, national, museum, of, natural, science, taichung, city, this, full, scale, fully, functional, replica, approximately, 12, meters, 39, feet, in, height, was, constructed, from, su, song, s, original, descriptions, and, mechanical, drawings, the, chinese, escapement, spread, west, and, was, the, source, for, western, escapement, technology, in, the, 12th, century, al, jazari, an, engineer, from, mesopotamia, lived, 1136, 1206, who, worked, for, the, artuqid, king, of, diyar, bakr, nasir, al, din, made, numerous, clocks, of, all, shapes, and, sizes, the, most, reputed, clocks, included, the, elephant, scribe, and, castle, clocks, some, of, which, have, been, successfully, reconstructed, as, well, as, telling, the, time, these, grand, clocks, were, symbols, of, the, status, grandeur, and, wealth, of, the, urtuq, state, knowledge, of, these, mercury, escapements, may, have, spread, through, europe, with, translations, of, arabic, and, spanish, texts, the, word, horologia, from, the, greek, hour, and, to, tell, was, used, to, describe, early, mechanical, clocks, but, the, use, of, this, word, still, used, in, several, romance, languages, for, all, timekeepers, conceals, the, true, nature, of, the, mechanisms, for, example, there, is, a, record, that, in, 1176, sens, cathedral, in, france, installed, an, horologe, but, the, mechanism, used, is, unknown, according, to, jocelyn, de, brakelond, in, 1198, during, a, fire, at, the, abbey, of, st, edmundsbury, now, bury, st, edmunds, the, monks, ran, to, the, clock, to, fetch, water, indicating, that, their, water, clock, had, a, reservoir, large, enough, to, help, extinguish, the, occasional, fire, the, word, clock, via, medieval, latin, clocca, from, old, irish, clocc, both, meaning, bell, which, gradually, supersedes, horologe, suggests, that, it, was, the, sound, of, bells, that, also, characterized, the, prototype, mechanical, clocks, that, appeared, during, the, 13th, century, in, europe, in, europe, between, 1280, and, 1320, there, was, an, increase, in, the, number, of, references, to, clocks, and, horologes, in, church, records, and, this, probably, indicates, that, a, new, type, of, clock, mechanism, had, been, devised, existing, clock, mechanisms, that, used, water, power, were, being, adapted, to, take, their, driving, power, from, falling, weights, this, power, was, controlled, by, some, form, of, oscillating, mechanism, probably, derived, from, existing, bell, ringing, or, alarm, devices, this, controlled, release, of, power, the, escapement, marks, the, beginning, of, the, true, mechanical, clock, which, differed, from, the, previously, mentioned, cogwheel, clocks, the, verge, escapement, mechanism, appeared, during, the, surge, of, true, mechanical, clock, development, which, did, not, need, any, kind, of, fluid, power, like, water, or, mercury, to, work, these, mechanical, clocks, were, intended, for, two, main, purposes, for, signalling, and, notification, e, g, the, timing, of, services, and, public, events, and, for, modeling, the, solar, system, the, former, purpose, is, administrative, the, latter, arises, naturally, given, the, scholarly, interests, in, astronomy, science, and, astrology, and, how, these, subjects, integrated, with, the, religious, philosophy, of, the, time, the, astrolabe, was, used, both, by, astronomers, and, astrologers, and, it, was, natural, to, apply, a, clockwork, drive, to, the, rotating, plate, to, produce, a, working, model, of, the, solar, system, simple, clocks, intended, mainly, for, notification, were, installed, in, towers, and, did, not, always, require, faces, or, hands, they, would, have, announced, the, canonical, hours, or, intervals, between, set, times, of, prayer, canonical, hours, varied, in, length, as, the, times, of, sunrise, and, sunset, shifted, the, more, sophisticated, astronomical, clocks, would, have, had, moving, dials, or, hands, and, would, have, shown, the, time, in, various, time, systems, including, italian, hours, canonical, hours, and, time, as, measured, by, astronomers, at, the, time, both, styles, of, clocks, started, acquiring, extravagant, features, such, as, automata, in, 1283, a, large, clock, was, installed, at, dunstable, priory, in, bedfordshire, in, southern, england, its, location, above, the, rood, screen, suggests, that, it, was, not, a, water, clock, in, 1292, canterbury, cathedral, installed, a, great, horloge, over, the, next, 30, years, there, were, mentions, of, clocks, at, a, number, of, ecclesiastical, institutions, in, england, italy, and, france, in, 1322, a, new, clock, was, installed, in, norwich, an, expensive, replacement, for, an, earlier, clock, installed, in, 1273, this, had, a, large, 2, metre, astronomical, dial, with, automata, and, bells, the, costs, of, the, installation, included, the, full, time, employment, of, two, clockkeepers, for, two, years, an, elaborate, water, clock, the, cosmic, engine, was, invented, by, su, song, a, chinese, polymath, designed, and, constructed, in, china, in, 1092, this, great, astronomical, hydromechanical, clock, tower, was, about, ten, metres, high, about, 30, feet, and, was, indirectly, powered, by, a, rotating, wheel, with, falling, water, and, liquid, mercury, which, turned, an, armillary, sphere, capable, of, calculating, complex, astronomical, problems, in, europe, there, were, the, clocks, constructed, by, richard, of, wallingford, in, albans, by, 1336, and, by, giovanni, de, dondi, in, padua, from, 1348, to, 1364, they, no, longer, exist, but, detailed, descriptions, of, their, design, and, construction, survive, and, modern, reproductions, have, been, made, they, illustrate, how, quickly, the, theory, of, the, mechanical, clock, had, been, translated, into, practical, constructions, and, also, that, one, of, the, many, impulses, to, their, development, had, been, the, desire, of, astronomers, to, investigate, celestial, phenomena, the, astrarium, of, giovanni, dondi, dell, orologio, was, a, complex, astronomical, clock, built, between, 1348, and, 1364, in, padua, italy, by, the, doctor, and, clock, maker, giovanni, dondi, dell, orologio, the, astrarium, had, seven, faces, and, 107, moving, gears, it, showed, the, positions, of, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, five, planets, then, known, as, well, as, religious, feast, days, the, astrarium, stood, about, 1, metre, high, and, consisted, of, a, seven, sided, brass, or, iron, framework, resting, on, 7, decorative, paw, shaped, feet, the, lower, section, provided, a, 24, hour, dial, and, a, large, calendar, drum, showing, the, fixed, feasts, of, the, church, the, movable, feasts, and, the, position, in, the, zodiac, of, the, moon, s, ascending, node, the, upper, section, contained, 7, dials, each, about, 30, cm, in, diameter, showing, the, positional, data, for, the, primum, mobile, venus, mercury, the, moon, saturn, jupiter, and, mars, directly, above, the, 24, hour, dial, is, the, dial, of, the, primum, mobile, so, called, because, it, reproduces, the, diurnal, motion, of, the, stars, and, the, annual, motion, of, the, sun, against, the, background, of, stars, each, of, the, planetary, dials, used, complex, clockwork, to, produce, reasonably, accurate, models, of, the, planets, motion, these, agreed, reasonably, well, both, with, ptolemaic, theory, and, with, observations, wallingford, s, clock, had, a, large, astrolabe, type, dial, showing, the, sun, the, moon, s, age, phase, and, node, a, star, map, and, possibly, the, planets, in, addition, it, had, a, wheel, of, fortune, and, an, indicator, of, the, state, of, the, tide, at, london, bridge, bells, rang, every, hour, the, number, of, strokes, indicating, the, time, dondi, s, clock, was, a, seven, sided, construction, 1, metre, high, with, dials, showing, the, time, of, day, including, minutes, the, motions, of, all, the, known, planets, an, automatic, calendar, of, fixed, and, movable, feasts, and, an, eclipse, prediction, hand, rotating, once, every, 18, years, it, is, not, known, how, accurate, or, reliable, these, clocks, would, have, been, they, were, probably, adjusted, manually, every, day, to, compensate, for, errors, caused, by, wear, and, imprecise, manufacture, water, clocks, are, sometimes, still, used, today, and, can, be, examined, in, places, such, as, ancient, castles, and, museums, the, salisbury, cathedral, clock, built, in, 1386, is, considered, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, mechanical, clock, that, strikes, the, hours, clockmakers, developed, their, art, in, various, ways, building, smaller, clocks, was, a, technical, challenge, as, was, improving, accuracy, and, reliability, clocks, could, be, impressive, showpieces, to, demonstrate, skilled, craftsmanship, or, less, expensive, mass, produced, items, for, domestic, use, the, escapement, in, particular, was, an, important, factor, affecting, the, clock, s, accuracy, so, many, different, mechanisms, were, tried, spring, driven, clocks, appeared, during, the, 15th, century, although, they, are, often, erroneously, credited, to, nuremberg, watchmaker, peter, henlein, or, henle, or, hele, around, 1511, the, earliest, existing, spring, driven, clock, is, the, chamber, clock, given, to, phillip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, around, 1430, now, in, the, germanisches, nationalmuseum, spring, power, presented, clockmakers, with, a, new, problem, how, to, keep, the, clock, movement, running, at, a, constant, rate, as, the, spring, ran, down, this, resulted, in, the, invention, of, the, stackfreed, and, the, fusee, in, the, 15th, century, and, many, other, innovations, down, to, the, invention, of, the, modern, going, barrel, in, 1760, early, clock, dials, did, not, indicate, minutes, and, seconds, a, clock, with, a, dial, indicating, minutes, was, illustrated, in, a, 1475, manuscript, by, paulus, almanus, and, some, 15th, century, clocks, in, germany, indicated, minutes, and, seconds, an, early, record, of, a, seconds, hand, on, a, clock, dates, back, to, about, 1560, on, a, clock, now, in, the, fremersdorf, collection, 417, 418, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, clockmaking, flourished, particularly, in, the, metalworking, towns, of, nuremberg, and, augsburg, and, in, blois, france, some, of, the, more, basic, table, clocks, have, only, one, time, keeping, hand, with, the, dial, between, the, hour, markers, being, divided, into, four, equal, parts, making, the, clocks, readable, to, the, nearest, 15, minutes, other, clocks, were, exhibitions, of, craftsmanship, and, skill, incorporating, astronomical, indicators, and, musical, movements, the, cross, beat, escapement, was, invented, in, 1584, by, jost, b, rgi, who, also, developed, the, remontoire, b, rgi, s, clocks, were, a, great, improvement, in, accuracy, as, they, were, correct, to, within, a, minute, a, day, these, clocks, helped, the, 16th, century, astronomer, tycho, brahe, to, observe, astronomical, events, with, much, greater, precision, than, before, the, next, development, in, accuracy, occurred, after, 1656, with, the, invention, of, the, pendulum, clock, galileo, had, the, idea, to, use, a, swinging, bob, to, regulate, the, motion, of, a, time, telling, device, earlier, in, the, 17th, century, christiaan, huygens, however, is, usually, credited, as, the, inventor, he, determined, the, mathematical, formula, that, related, pendulum, length, to, time, about, 99, 4, cm, or, 39, 1, inches, for, the, one, second, movement, and, had, the, first, pendulum, driven, clock, made, the, first, model, clock, was, built, in, 1657, in, the, hague, but, it, was, in, england, that, the, idea, was, taken, up, the, longcase, clock, also, known, as, the, grandfather, clock, was, created, to, house, the, pendulum, and, works, by, the, english, clockmaker, william, clement, in, 1670, or, 1671, it, was, also, at, this, time, that, clock, cases, began, to, be, made, of, wood, and, clock, faces, to, use, enamel, as, well, as, hand, painted, ceramics, in, 1670, william, clement, created, the, anchor, escapement, an, improvement, over, huygens, crown, escapement, clement, also, introduced, the, pendulum, suspension, spring, in, 1671, the, concentric, minute, hand, was, added, to, the, clock, by, daniel, quare, a, london, clockmaker, and, others, and, the, second, hand, was, first, introduced, in, 1675, huygens, and, robert, hooke, invented, the, spiral, balance, spring, or, the, hairspring, designed, to, control, the, oscillating, speed, of, the, balance, wheel, this, crucial, advance, finally, made, accurate, pocket, watches, possible, the, great, english, clockmaker, thomas, tompion, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, this, mechanism, successfully, in, his, pocket, watches, and, he, adopted, the, minute, hand, which, after, a, variety, of, designs, were, trialled, eventually, stabilised, into, the, modern, day, configuration, the, rack, and, snail, striking, mechanism, for, striking, clocks, was, introduced, during, the, 17th, century, and, had, distinct, advantages, over, the, countwheel, or, locking, plate, mechanism, during, the, 20th, century, there, was, a, common, misconception, that, edward, barlow, invented, rack, and, snail, striking, in, fact, his, invention, was, connected, with, a, repeating, mechanism, employing, the, rack, and, snail, the, repeating, clock, that, chimes, the, number, of, hours, or, even, minutes, on, demand, was, invented, by, either, quare, or, barlow, in, 1676, george, graham, invented, the, deadbeat, escapement, for, clocks, in, 1720, a, major, stimulus, to, improving, the, accuracy, and, reliability, of, clocks, was, the, importance, of, precise, time, keeping, for, navigation, the, position, of, a, ship, at, sea, could, be, determined, with, reasonable, accuracy, if, a, navigator, could, refer, to, a, clock, that, lost, or, gained, less, than, about, 10, seconds, per, day, this, clock, could, not, contain, a, pendulum, which, would, be, virtually, useless, on, a, rocking, ship, in, 1714, the, british, government, offered, large, financial, rewards, to, the, value, of, 20, 000, pounds, for, anyone, who, could, determine, longitude, accurately, john, harrison, who, dedicated, his, life, to, improving, the, accuracy, of, his, clocks, later, received, considerable, sums, under, the, longitude, act, in, 1735, harrison, built, his, first, chronometer, which, he, steadily, improved, on, over, the, next, thirty, years, before, submitting, it, for, examination, the, clock, had, many, innovations, including, the, use, of, bearings, to, reduce, friction, weighted, balances, to, compensate, for, the, ship, s, pitch, and, roll, in, the, sea, and, the, use, of, two, different, metals, to, reduce, the, problem, of, expansion, from, heat, the, chronometer, was, tested, in, 1761, by, harrison, s, son, and, by, the, end, of, 10, weeks, the, clock, was, in, error, by, less, than, 5, seconds, the, british, had, dominated, watch, manufacture, for, much, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, but, maintained, a, system, of, production, that, was, geared, towards, high, quality, products, for, the, elite, although, there, was, an, attempt, to, modernise, clock, manufacture, with, mass, production, techniques, and, the, application, of, duplicating, tools, and, machinery, by, the, british, watch, company, in, 1843, it, was, in, the, united, states, that, this, system, took, off, in, 1816, eli, terry, and, some, other, connecticut, clockmakers, developed, a, way, of, mass, producing, clocks, by, using, interchangeable, parts, aaron, lufkin, dennison, started, a, factory, in, 1851, in, massachusetts, that, also, used, interchangeable, parts, and, by, 1861, was, running, a, successful, enterprise, incorporated, as, the, waltham, watch, company, in, 1815, the, english, scientist, francis, ronalds, published, the, first, electric, clock, powered, by, dry, pile, batteries, alexander, bain, a, scottish, clockmaker, patented, the, electric, clock, in, 1840, the, electric, clock, s, mainspring, is, wound, either, with, an, electric, motor, or, with, an, electromagnet, and, armature, in, 1841, he, first, patented, the, electromagnetic, pendulum, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, advent, of, the, dry, cell, battery, made, it, feasible, to, use, electric, power, in, clocks, spring, or, weight, driven, clocks, that, use, electricity, either, alternating, current, ac, or, direct, current, dc, to, rewind, the, spring, or, raise, the, weight, of, a, mechanical, clock, would, be, classified, as, an, electromechanical, clock, this, classification, would, also, apply, to, clocks, that, employ, an, electrical, impulse, to, propel, the, pendulum, in, electromechanical, clocks, the, electricity, serves, no, time, keeping, function, these, types, of, clocks, were, made, as, individual, timepieces, but, more, commonly, used, in, synchronized, time, installations, in, schools, businesses, factories, railroads, and, government, facilities, as, a, master, clock, and, slave, clocks, where, an, ac, electrical, supply, of, stable, frequency, is, available, timekeeping, can, be, maintained, very, reliably, by, using, a, synchronous, motor, essentially, counting, the, cycles, the, supply, current, alternates, with, an, accurate, frequency, of, 50, hertz, in, many, countries, and, 60, hertz, in, others, while, the, frequency, may, vary, slightly, during, the, day, as, the, load, changes, generators, are, designed, to, maintain, an, accurate, number, of, cycles, over, a, day, so, the, clock, may, be, a, fraction, of, a, second, slow, or, fast, at, any, time, but, will, be, perfectly, accurate, over, a, long, time, the, rotor, of, the, motor, rotates, at, a, speed, that, is, related, to, the, alternation, frequency, appropriate, gearing, converts, this, rotation, speed, to, the, correct, ones, for, the, hands, of, the, analog, clock, time, in, these, cases, is, measured, in, several, ways, such, as, by, counting, the, cycles, of, the, ac, supply, vibration, of, a, tuning, fork, the, behaviour, of, quartz, crystals, or, the, quantum, vibrations, of, atoms, electronic, circuits, divide, these, high, frequency, oscillations, to, slower, ones, that, drive, the, time, display, the, piezoelectric, properties, of, crystalline, quartz, were, discovered, by, jacques, and, pierre, curie, in, 1880, the, first, crystal, oscillator, was, invented, in, 1917, by, alexander, m, nicholson, after, which, the, first, quartz, crystal, oscillator, was, built, by, walter, g, cady, in, 1921, in, 1927, the, first, quartz, clock, was, built, by, warren, marrison, and, j, w, horton, at, bell, telephone, laboratories, in, canada, the, following, decades, saw, the, development, of, quartz, clocks, as, precision, time, measurement, devices, in, laboratory, settings, the, bulky, and, delicate, counting, electronics, built, with, vacuum, tubes, at, the, time, limited, their, practical, use, elsewhere, the, national, bureau, of, standards, now, nist, based, the, time, standard, of, the, united, states, on, quartz, clocks, from, late, 1929, until, the, 1960s, when, it, changed, to, atomic, clocks, in, 1969, seiko, produced, the, world, s, first, quartz, wristwatch, the, astron, their, inherent, accuracy, and, low, cost, of, production, resulted, in, the, subsequent, proliferation, of, quartz, clocks, and, watches, currently, atomic, clocks, are, the, most, accurate, clocks, in, existence, they, are, considerably, more, accurate, than, quartz, clocks, as, they, can, be, accurate, to, within, a, few, seconds, over, trillions, of, years, atomic, clocks, were, first, theorized, by, lord, kelvin, in, 1879, in, the, 1930s, the, development, of, magnetic, resonance, created, practical, method, for, doing, this, a, prototype, ammonia, maser, device, was, built, in, 1949, at, the, u, s, national, bureau, of, standards, nbs, now, nist, although, it, was, less, accurate, than, existing, quartz, clocks, it, served, to, demonstrate, the, concept, the, first, accurate, atomic, clock, a, caesium, standard, based, on, a, certain, transition, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, was, built, by, louis, essen, in, 1955, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, in, the, uk, calibration, of, the, caesium, standard, atomic, clock, was, carried, out, by, the, use, of, the, astronomical, time, scale, ephemeris, time, et, as, of, 2013, the, most, stable, atomic, clocks, are, ytterbium, clocks, which, are, stable, to, within, less, than, two, parts, in, 1, quintillion, 2, 10, 18, the, invention, of, the, mechanical, clock, in, the, 13th, century, initiated, a, change, in, timekeeping, methods, from, continuous, processes, such, as, the, motion, of, the, gnomon, s, shadow, on, a, sundial, or, the, flow, of, liquid, in, a, water, clock, to, periodic, oscillatory, processes, such, as, the, swing, of, a, pendulum, or, the, vibration, of, a, quartz, crystal, which, had, the, potential, for, more, accuracy, all, modern, clocks, use, oscillation, although, the, mechanisms, they, use, vary, all, oscillating, clocks, mechanical, electric, and, atomic, work, similarly, and, can, be, divided, into, analogous, parts, they, consist, of, an, object, that, repeats, the, same, motion, over, and, over, again, an, oscillator, with, a, precisely, constant, time, interval, between, each, repetition, or, beat, attached, to, the, oscillator, is, a, controller, device, which, sustains, the, oscillator, s, motion, by, replacing, the, energy, it, loses, to, friction, and, converts, its, oscillations, into, a, series, of, pulses, the, pulses, are, then, counted, by, some, type, of, counter, and, the, number, of, counts, is, converted, into, convenient, units, usually, seconds, minutes, hours, etc, finally, some, kind, of, indicator, displays, the, result, in, human, readable, form, the, timekeeping, element, in, every, modern, clock, is, a, harmonic, oscillator, a, physical, object, resonator, that, vibrates, or, oscillates, repetitively, at, a, precisely, constant, frequency, the, advantage, of, a, harmonic, oscillator, over, other, forms, of, oscillator, is, that, it, employs, resonance, to, vibrate, at, a, precise, natural, resonant, frequency, or, beat, dependent, only, on, its, physical, characteristics, and, resists, vibrating, at, other, rates, the, possible, precision, achievable, by, a, harmonic, oscillator, is, measured, by, a, parameter, called, its, q, or, quality, factor, which, increases, other, things, being, equal, with, its, resonant, frequency, this, is, why, there, has, been, a, long, term, trend, toward, higher, frequency, oscillators, in, clocks, balance, wheels, and, pendulums, always, include, a, means, of, adjusting, the, rate, of, the, timepiece, quartz, timepieces, sometimes, include, a, rate, screw, that, adjusts, a, capacitor, for, that, purpose, atomic, clocks, are, primary, standards, and, their, rate, cannot, be, adjusted, some, clocks, rely, for, their, accuracy, on, an, external, oscillator, that, is, they, are, automatically, synchronized, to, a, more, accurate, clock, this, has, the, dual, function, of, keeping, the, oscillator, running, by, giving, it, pushes, to, replace, the, energy, lost, to, friction, and, converting, its, vibrations, into, a, series, of, pulses, that, serve, to, measure, the, time, in, mechanical, clocks, the, low, q, of, the, balance, wheel, or, pendulum, oscillator, made, them, very, sensitive, to, the, disturbing, effect, of, the, impulses, of, the, escapement, so, the, escapement, had, a, great, effect, on, the, accuracy, of, the, clock, and, many, escapement, designs, were, tried, the, higher, q, of, resonators, in, electronic, clocks, makes, them, relatively, insensitive, to, the, disturbing, effects, of, the, drive, power, so, the, driving, oscillator, circuit, is, a, much, less, critical, component, this, counts, the, pulses, and, adds, them, up, to, get, traditional, time, units, of, seconds, minutes, hours, etc, it, usually, has, a, provision, for, setting, the, clock, by, manually, entering, the, correct, time, into, the, counter, this, displays, the, count, of, seconds, minutes, hours, etc, in, a, human, readable, form, clocks, can, be, classified, by, the, type, of, time, display, as, well, as, by, the, method, of, timekeeping, analog, clocks, usually, use, a, clock, face, which, indicates, time, using, rotating, pointers, called, hands, on, a, fixed, numbered, dial, or, dials, the, standard, clock, face, known, universally, throughout, the, world, has, a, short, hour, hand, which, indicates, the, hour, on, a, circular, dial, of, 12, hours, making, two, revolutions, per, day, and, a, longer, minute, hand, which, indicates, the, minutes, in, the, current, hour, on, the, same, dial, which, is, also, divided, into, 60, minutes, it, may, also, have, a, second, hand, which, indicates, the, seconds, in, the, current, minute, the, only, other, widely, used, clock, face, today, is, the, 24, hour, analog, dial, because, of, the, use, of, 24, hour, time, in, military, organizations, and, timetables, before, the, modern, clock, face, was, standardized, during, the, industrial, revolution, many, other, face, designs, were, used, throughout, the, years, including, dials, divided, into, 6, 8, 10, and, 24, hours, during, the, french, revolution, the, french, government, tried, to, introduce, a, 10, hour, clock, as, part, of, their, decimal, based, metric, system, of, measurement, but, it, did, not, achieve, widespread, use, an, italian, 6, hour, clock, was, developed, in, the, 18th, century, presumably, to, save, power, a, clock, or, watch, striking, 24, times, uses, more, power, another, type, of, analog, clock, is, the, sundial, which, tracks, the, sun, continuously, registering, the, time, by, the, shadow, position, of, its, gnomon, because, the, sun, does, not, adjust, to, daylight, saving, time, users, must, add, an, hour, during, that, time, corrections, must, also, be, made, for, the, equation, of, time, and, for, the, difference, between, the, longitudes, of, the, sundial, and, of, the, central, meridian, of, the, time, zone, that, is, being, used, i, e, 15, degrees, east, of, the, prime, meridian, for, each, hour, that, the, time, zone, is, ahead, of, gmt, sundials, use, some, or, part, of, the, 24, hour, analog, dial, there, also, exist, clocks, which, use, a, digital, display, despite, having, an, analog, mechanism, these, are, commonly, referred, to, as, flip, clocks, alternative, systems, have, been, proposed, for, example, the, twelv, clock, indicates, the, current, hour, using, one, of, twelve, colors, and, indicates, the, minute, by, showing, a, proportion, of, a, circular, disk, similar, to, a, moon, phase, digital, clocks, display, a, numeric, representation, of, time, two, numeric, display, formats, are, commonly, used, on, digital, clocks, most, digital, clocks, use, electronic, mechanisms, and, lcd, led, or, vfd, displays, many, other, display, technologies, are, used, as, well, cathode, ray, tubes, nixie, tubes, etc, after, a, reset, battery, change, or, power, failure, these, clocks, without, a, backup, battery, or, capacitor, either, start, counting, from, 12, 00, or, stay, at, 12, 00, often, with, blinking, digits, indicating, that, the, time, needs, to, be, set, some, newer, clocks, will, reset, themselves, based, on, radio, or, internet, time, servers, that, are, tuned, to, national, atomic, clocks, since, the, introduction, of, digital, clocks, in, the, 1960s, there, has, been, a, notable, decline, in, the, use, of, analog, clocks, some, clocks, called, flip, clocks, have, digital, displays, that, work, mechanically, the, digits, are, painted, on, sheets, of, material, which, are, mounted, like, the, pages, of, a, book, once, a, minute, a, page, is, turned, over, to, reveal, the, next, digit, these, displays, are, usually, easier, to, read, in, brightly, lit, conditions, than, lcds, or, leds, also, they, do, not, go, back, to, 12, 00, after, a, power, interruption, flip, clocks, generally, do, not, have, electronic, mechanisms, usually, they, are, driven, by, ac, synchronous, motors, clocks, with, analog, quadrants, with, a, digital, component, usually, minutes, and, hours, displayed, analogously, and, seconds, displayed, in, digital, mode, for, convenience, distance, telephony, or, blindness, auditory, clocks, present, the, time, as, sounds, the, sound, is, either, spoken, natural, language, e, g, the, time, is, twelve, thirty, five, or, as, auditory, codes, e, g, number, of, sequential, bell, rings, on, the, hour, represents, the, number, of, the, hour, like, the, bell, big, ben, most, telecommunication, companies, also, provide, a, speaking, clock, service, as, well, word, clocks, are, clocks, that, display, the, time, visually, using, sentences, e, g, it, s, about, three, o, clock, these, clocks, can, be, implemented, in, hardware, or, software, some, clocks, usually, digital, ones, include, an, optical, projector, that, shines, a, magnified, image, of, the, time, display, onto, a, screen, or, onto, a, surface, such, as, an, indoor, ceiling, or, wall, the, digits, are, large, enough, to, be, easily, read, without, using, glasses, by, persons, with, moderately, imperfect, vision, so, the, clocks, are, convenient, for, use, in, their, bedrooms, usually, the, timekeeping, circuitry, has, a, battery, as, a, backup, source, for, an, uninterrupted, power, supply, to, keep, the, clock, on, time, while, the, projection, light, only, works, when, the, unit, is, connected, to, an, a, c, supply, completely, battery, powered, portable, versions, resembling, flashlights, are, also, available, auditory, and, projection, clocks, can, be, used, by, people, who, are, blind, or, have, limited, vision, there, are, also, clocks, for, the, blind, that, have, displays, that, can, be, read, by, using, the, sense, of, touch, some, of, these, are, similar, to, normal, analog, displays, but, are, constructed, so, the, hands, can, be, felt, without, damaging, them, another, type, is, essentially, digital, and, uses, devices, that, use, a, code, such, as, braille, to, show, the, digits, so, that, they, can, be, felt, with, the, fingertips, some, clocks, have, several, displays, driven, by, a, single, mechanism, and, some, others, have, several, completely, separate, mechanisms, in, a, single, case, clocks, in, public, places, often, have, several, faces, visible, from, different, directions, so, that, the, clock, can, be, read, from, anywhere, in, the, vicinity, all, the, faces, show, the, same, time, other, clocks, show, the, current, time, in, several, time, zones, watches, that, are, intended, to, be, carried, by, travellers, often, have, two, displays, one, for, the, local, time, and, the, other, for, the, time, at, home, which, is, useful, for, making, pre, arranged, phone, calls, some, equation, clocks, have, two, displays, one, showing, mean, time, and, the, other, solar, time, as, would, be, shown, by, a, sundial, some, clocks, have, both, analog, and, digital, displays, clocks, with, braille, displays, usually, also, have, conventional, digits, so, they, can, be, read, by, sighted, people, clocks, are, in, homes, offices, and, many, other, places, smaller, ones, watches, are, carried, on, the, wrist, or, in, a, pocket, larger, ones, are, in, public, places, e, g, a, railway, station, or, church, a, small, clock, is, often, shown, in, a, corner, of, computer, displays, mobile, phones, and, many, mp3, players, the, primary, purpose, of, a, clock, is, to, display, the, time, clocks, may, also, have, the, facility, to, make, a, loud, alert, signal, at, a, specified, time, typically, to, waken, a, sleeper, at, a, preset, time, they, are, referred, to, as, alarm, clocks, the, alarm, may, start, at, a, low, volume, and, become, louder, or, have, the, facility, to, be, switched, off, for, a, few, minutes, then, resume, alarm, clocks, with, visible, indicators, are, sometimes, used, to, indicate, to, children, too, young, to, read, the, time, that, the, time, for, sleep, has, finished, they, are, sometimes, called, training, clocks, a, clock, mechanism, may, be, used, to, control, a, device, according, to, time, e, g, a, central, heating, system, a, vcr, or, a, time, bomb, see, digital, counter, such, mechanisms, are, usually, called, timers, clock, mechanisms, are, also, used, to, drive, devices, such, as, solar, trackers, and, astronomical, telescopes, which, have, to, turn, at, accurately, controlled, speeds, to, counteract, the, rotation, of, the, earth, most, digital, computers, depend, on, an, internal, signal, at, constant, frequency, to, synchronize, processing, this, is, referred, to, as, a, clock, signal, a, few, research, projects, are, developing, cpus, based, on, asynchronous, circuits, some, equipment, including, computers, also, maintains, time, and, date, for, use, as, required, this, is, referred, to, as, time, of, day, clock, and, is, distinct, from, the, system, clock, signal, although, possibly, based, on, counting, its, cycles, for, some, scientific, work, timing, of, the, utmost, accuracy, is, essential, it, is, also, necessary, to, have, a, standard, of, the, maximum, accuracy, against, which, working, clocks, can, be, calibrated, an, ideal, clock, would, give, the, time, to, unlimited, accuracy, but, this, is, not, realisable, many, physical, processes, in, particular, including, some, transitions, between, atomic, energy, levels, occur, at, exceedingly, stable, frequency, counting, cycles, of, such, a, process, can, give, a, very, accurate, and, consistent, time, clocks, which, work, this, way, are, usually, called, atomic, clocks, such, clocks, are, typically, large, very, expensive, require, a, controlled, environment, and, are, far, more, accurate, than, required, for, most, purposes, they, are, typically, used, in, a, standards, laboratory, until, advances, in, the, late, twentieth, century, navigation, depended, on, the, ability, to, measure, latitude, and, longitude, latitude, can, be, determined, through, celestial, navigation, the, measurement, of, longitude, requires, accurate, knowledge, of, time, this, need, was, a, major, motivation, for, the, development, of, accurate, mechanical, clocks, john, harrison, created, the, first, highly, accurate, marine, chronometer, in, the, mid, 18th, century, the, noon, gun, in, cape, town, still, fires, an, accurate, signal, to, allow, ships, to, check, their, chronometers, many, buildings, near, major, ports, used, to, have, some, still, do, a, large, ball, mounted, on, a, tower, or, mast, arranged, to, drop, at, a, pre, determined, time, for, the, same, purpose, while, satellite, navigation, systems, such, as, gps, require, unprecedentedly, accurate, knowledge, of, time, this, is, supplied, by, equipment, on, the, satellites, vehicles, no, longer, need, timekeeping, equipment, clocks, can, be, used, to, measure, varying, periods, of, time, in, games, and, sports, stopwatches, can, be, used, to, time, the, performance, of, track, athletes, chess, clocks, are, used, to, limit, the, board, game, players, time, to, make, a, move, in, various, sports, game, clocks, measure, the, duration, the, game, or, subdivisions, of, the, game, while, other, clocks, may, be, used, for, tracking, different, durations, these, include, play, clocks, shot, clocks, and, pitch, clocks, in, the, united, kingdom, clocks, are, associated, with, various, beliefs, many, involving, death, or, bad, luck, in, legends, clocks, have, reportedly, stopped, of, their, own, accord, upon, a, nearby, person, s, death, especially, those, of, monarchs, the, clock, in, the, house, of, lords, supposedly, stopped, at, nearly, the, hour, of, george, iii, s, death, in, 1820, the, one, at, balmoral, castle, stopped, during, the, hour, of, queen, victoria, s, death, and, similar, legends, are, related, about, clocks, associated, with, william, iv, and, elizabeth, i, many, superstitions, exist, about, clocks, one, stopping, before, a, person, has, died, may, foretell, coming, death, similarly, if, a, clock, strikes, during, a, church, hymn, or, a, marriage, ceremony, death, or, calamity, is, prefigured, for, the, parishioners, or, a, spouse, respectively, death, or, ill, events, are, foreshadowed, if, a, clock, strikes, the, wrong, time, it, may, also, be, unlucky, to, have, a, clock, face, a, fire, or, to, speak, while, a, clock, is, striking, in, chinese, culture, giving, a, clock, traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, s, ng, zh, ng, is, often, taboo, especially, to, the, elderly, as, it, is, a, homophone, of, the, act, of, attending, another, s, funeral, traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, s, ngzh, ng
