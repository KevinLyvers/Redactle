hay, is, grass, legumes, or, other, herbaceous, plants, that, have, been, cut, and, dried, to, be, stored, for, use, as, animal, fodder, either, for, large, grazing, animals, raised, as, livestock, such, as, cattle, horses, goats, and, sheep, or, for, smaller, domesticated, animals, such, as, rabbits, and, guinea, pigs, pigs, can, eat, hay, but, do, not, digest, it, as, efficiently, as, herbivores, do, hay, can, be, used, as, animal, fodder, when, or, where, there, is, not, enough, pasture, or, rangeland, on, which, to, graze, an, animal, when, grazing, is, not, feasible, due, to, weather, such, as, during, the, winter, or, when, lush, pasture, by, itself, would, be, too, rich, for, the, health, of, the, animal, it, is, also, fed, when, an, animal, cannot, access, any, pastures, for, example, when, the, animal, is, being, kept, in, a, stable, or, barn, hay, production, and, harvest, commonly, known, as, making, hay, haymaking, haying, or, doing, hay, involves, a, multiple, step, process, cutting, drying, or, curing, raking, processing, and, storing, hayfields, do, not, have, to, be, reseeded, each, year, in, the, way, that, grain, crops, are, but, regular, fertilizing, is, usually, desirable, and, overseeding, a, field, every, few, years, helps, increase, yield, commonly, used, plants, for, hay, include, mixtures, of, grasses, such, as, ryegrass, lolium, species, timothy, brome, fescue, bermuda, grass, orchard, grass, and, other, species, depending, on, region, hay, may, also, include, legumes, such, as, alfalfa, lucerne, and, clovers, red, white, and, subterranean, legumes, in, hay, are, ideally, cut, pre, bloom, other, pasture, forbs, are, also, sometimes, a, part, of, the, mix, though, these, plants, are, not, necessarily, desired, as, certain, forbs, are, toxic, to, some, animals, in, the, uk, some, hay, is, harvested, from, traditionally, managed, hay, meadows, which, have, a, highly, diverse, flora, and, which, support, a, rich, eco, system, the, hay, produced, by, these, meadows, is, species, rich, and, was, traditionally, used, to, feed, horses, oat, barley, and, wheat, plant, materials, are, occasionally, cut, green, and, made, into, hay, for, animal, fodder, and, more, usually, used, in, the, form, of, straw, a, harvest, byproduct, of, stems, and, dead, leaves, that, are, baled, after, the, grain, has, been, harvested, and, threshed, straw, is, used, mainly, for, animal, bedding, although, straw, is, also, used, as, fodder, particularly, as, a, source, of, dietary, fiber, it, has, lower, nutritional, value, than, hay, in, agroforestry, systems, are, developed, to, produce, tree, hay, it, is, the, leaf, and, seed, material, in, the, hay, that, determines, its, quality, because, they, contain, more, of, the, nutrition, value, for, the, animal, than, the, stems, do, 194, farmers, try, to, harvest, hay, at, the, point, when, the, seed, heads, are, not, quite, ripe, and, the, leaf, is, at, its, maximum, when, the, grass, is, mowed, in, the, field, the, cut, material, is, allowed, to, dry, so, that, the, bulk, of, the, moisture, is, removed, but, the, leafy, material, is, still, robust, enough, to, be, picked, up, from, the, ground, by, machinery, and, processed, into, storage, in, bales, stacks, or, pits, methods, of, haymaking, thus, aim, to, minimize, the, shattering, and, falling, away, of, the, leaves, during, handling, 194, hay, production, is, highly, sensitive, to, weather, conditions, particularly, during, the, harvest, period, in, drought, conditions, both, seed, and, leaf, production, are, stunted, resulting, in, hay, with, a, high, ratio, of, dry, coarse, stems, that, possess, very, low, nutritional, value, conversely, excessively, wet, weather, can, cause, cut, hay, to, spoil, in, the, field, before, it, can, be, baled, consequently, the, primary, challenge, and, risk, for, farmers, in, hay, production, is, managing, the, weather, especially, during, the, critical, few, weeks, when, the, plants, are, at, optimal, maturity, for, harvesting, a, lucky, break, in, the, weather, often, moves, the, haymaking, tasks, such, as, mowing, tedding, and, baling, to, the, top, priority, on, the, farm, s, to, do, list, this, is, reflected, in, the, idiom, to, make, hay, while, the, sun, shines, hay, that, was, too, wet, at, cutting, may, develop, rot, and, mold, after, being, baled, creating, the, potential, for, toxins, to, form, in, the, feed, which, could, make, the, animals, sick, after, harvest, hay, also, has, to, be, stored, in, a, manner, to, prevent, it, from, getting, wet, mold, and, spoilage, reduce, nutritional, value, and, may, cause, illness, in, animals, a, symbiotic, fungus, in, fescue, may, cause, illness, in, horses, and, cattle, the, successful, harvest, of, maximum, yields, of, high, quality, hay, is, entirely, dependent, on, the, coincident, occurrence, of, optimum, crop, field, and, weather, conditions, when, this, occurs, there, may, be, a, period, of, intense, activity, on, the, hay, farm, while, harvest, proceeds, until, weather, conditions, become, unfavourable, hay, or, grass, is, the, foundation, of, the, diet, for, all, grazing, animals, and, can, provide, as, much, as, 100, of, the, fodder, required, for, an, animal, hay, is, usually, fed, to, an, animal, during, times, when, winter, drought, or, other, conditions, make, pasture, unavailable, animals, that, can, eat, hay, vary, in, the, types, of, grasses, suitable, for, consumption, the, ways, they, consume, hay, and, how, they, digest, it, therefore, different, types, of, animals, require, hay, that, consists, of, similar, plants, to, what, they, would, eat, while, grazing, and, likewise, plants, that, are, toxic, to, an, animal, in, pasture, are, generally, also, toxic, if, they, are, dried, into, hay, most, animals, are, fed, hay, in, two, daily, feedings, morning, and, evening, more, for, the, convenience, of, humans, as, most, grazing, animals, on, pasture, naturally, consume, fodder, in, multiple, feedings, throughout, the, day, some, animals, especially, those, being, raised, for, meat, may, be, given, enough, hay, that, they, simply, are, able, to, eat, all, day, other, animals, especially, those, that, are, ridden, or, driven, as, working, animals, may, be, given, a, more, limited, amount, of, hay, to, prevent, them, from, getting, too, fat, the, proper, amount, of, hay, and, the, type, of, hay, required, varies, somewhat, between, different, species, some, animals, are, also, fed, concentrated, feeds, such, as, grain, or, vitamin, supplements, in, addition, to, hay, in, most, cases, hay, or, pasture, forage, must, make, up, 50, or, more, of, the, diet, by, weight, one, of, the, most, significant, differences, in, hay, digestion, is, between, ruminant, animals, such, as, cattle, and, sheep, and, nonruminant, hindgut, fermentors, such, as, horses, both, types, of, animals, can, digest, cellulose, in, grass, and, hay, but, do, so, by, different, mechanisms, because, of, the, four, chambered, stomach, of, cattle, they, are, often, able, to, break, down, older, forage, and, have, more, tolerance, of, mold, and, changes, in, diet, the, single, chambered, stomach, and, cecum, or, hindgut, of, the, horse, uses, bacterial, processes, to, break, down, cellulose, that, are, more, sensitive, to, changes, in, feeds, and, the, presence, of, mold, or, other, toxins, requiring, horses, to, be, fed, hay, of, a, more, consistent, type, and, quality, different, animals, also, use, hay, in, different, ways, cattle, evolved, to, eat, forages, in, relatively, large, quantities, at, a, single, feeding, and, then, due, to, the, process, of, rumination, take, a, considerable, amount, of, time, for, their, stomachs, to, digest, food, often, accomplished, while, the, animal, is, lying, down, at, rest, thus, quantity, of, hay, is, important, for, cattle, who, can, effectively, digest, hay, of, low, quality, if, fed, in, sufficient, amounts, sheep, will, eat, between, two, and, four, percent, of, their, body, weight, per, day, in, dry, feed, such, as, hay, and, are, very, efficient, at, obtaining, the, most, nutrition, possible, from, three, to, five, pounds, per, day, of, hay, or, other, forage, they, require, three, to, four, hours, per, day, to, eat, enough, hay, to, meet, their, nutritional, requirements, unlike, ruminants, horses, digest, their, food, in, small, portions, throughout, the, day, and, can, utilize, only, about, 2, 5, of, their, body, weight, in, feed, within, a, 24, hour, period, horses, evolved, to, graze, continuously, while, on, the, move, covering, up, to, 50, miles, 80, km, per, day, in, the, wild, their, stomachs, digest, food, quickly, allowing, them, to, extract, a, higher, nutritional, value, from, smaller, quantities, of, feed, when, horses, are, fed, low, quality, hay, they, may, develop, an, unhealthy, obese, hay, belly, due, to, over, consumption, of, empty, calories, if, their, type, of, feed, is, changed, dramatically, or, if, they, are, fed, moldy, hay, or, hay, containing, toxic, plants, they, can, become, ill, colic, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, horses, contaminated, hay, can, also, lead, to, respiratory, problems, in, horses, hay, can, be, soaked, in, water, sprinkled, with, water, or, subjected, to, steaming, to, reduce, dust, methods, and, the, terminology, to, describe, the, steps, of, making, hay, have, varied, greatly, throughout, history, and, many, regional, variations, still, exist, today, whether, done, by, hand, or, by, modern, mechanized, equipment, tall, grass, and, legumes, at, the, proper, stage, of, maturity, must, be, cut, then, allowed, to, dry, preferably, by, the, sun, then, raked, into, long, narrow, piles, known, as, windrows, next, the, cured, hay, is, gathered, up, in, some, form, usually, by, some, type, of, baling, process, and, placed, for, storage, into, a, haystack, or, into, a, barn, or, shed, to, protect, it, from, moisture, and, rot, during, the, growing, season, which, is, spring, and, early, summer, in, temperate, climates, grass, grows, at, a, fast, pace, hay, reaches, its, peak, nutritional, value, when, all, leaves, are, fully, developed, and, seed, or, flower, heads, are, just, shy, of, full, maturity, at, this, stage, of, maximum, growth, in, the, pasture, or, field, if, timed, correctly, the, hay, is, cut, grass, hay, cut, too, early, retains, high, moisture, content, making, it, harder, to, cure, and, resulting, in, a, lower, yield, per, acre, compared, to, more, mature, grass, however, hay, cut, too, late, becomes, coarser, has, a, lower, resale, value, and, loses, some, of, its, nutrients, typically, there, is, a, two, week, window, during, which, grass, is, at, its, ideal, stage, for, harvesting, hay, the, time, for, cutting, alfalfa, hay, is, ideally, done, when, plants, reach, maximum, height, and, are, producing, flower, buds, or, just, beginning, to, bloom, cutting, during, or, after, full, bloom, results, in, lower, nutritional, value, of, the, hay, hay, can, be, raked, into, rows, as, it, is, cut, then, turned, periodically, to, dry, particularly, if, a, modern, swather, is, used, or, especially, with, older, equipment, or, methods, the, hay, is, cut, and, allowed, to, lie, spread, out, in, the, field, until, it, is, dry, then, raked, into, rows, for, processing, into, bales, afterwards, during, the, drying, period, which, can, take, several, days, the, process, is, usually, sped, up, by, turning, the, cut, hay, over, with, a, hay, rake, or, spreading, it, out, with, a, tedder, if, it, rains, while, the, hay, is, drying, turning, the, windrow, can, also, allow, it, to, dry, faster, turning, the, hay, too, often, or, too, roughly, can, also, cause, drying, leaf, matter, to, fall, off, reducing, the, nutrients, available, to, animals, drying, can, also, be, sped, up, by, mechanized, processes, such, as, the, use, of, a, hay, conditioner, or, by, the, use, of, chemicals, sprayed, onto, the, hay, to, speed, evaporation, of, moisture, though, these, are, more, expensive, techniques, not, in, general, use, except, in, areas, where, there, is, a, combination, of, modern, technology, high, prices, for, hay, and, too, much, rain, for, hay, to, dry, properly, once, hay, is, cut, dried, and, raked, into, windrows, it, is, usually, gathered, into, bales, or, bundles, and, then, hauled, to, a, central, location, for, storage, in, some, places, depending, on, geography, region, climate, and, culture, hay, is, gathered, loose, and, stacked, without, being, baled, first, columella, in, his, de, re, rustica, describes, the, usual, haying, process, of, the, early, roman, empire, timothy, grass, and, clover, were, the, most, common, plants, used, for, hay, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, though, both, plants, are, native, to, europe, much, hay, was, originally, cut, by, scythe, by, teams, of, workers, dried, in, the, field, and, gathered, loose, on, wagons, later, haying, was, accomplished, with, horse, drawn, implements, such, as, mowers, with, the, invention, of, agricultural, machinery, such, as, the, tractor, and, the, baler, most, hay, production, became, mechanized, by, the, 1930s, after, hay, was, cut, and, dried, it, was, raked, or, rowed, up, by, raking, it, into, a, linear, heap, by, hand, or, with, a, horse, drawn, implement, turning, hay, when, needed, originally, was, done, by, hand, with, a, fork, or, rake, once, the, dried, hay, was, rowed, up, pitchforks, were, used, to, pile, it, loose, originally, onto, a, horse, drawn, cart, or, wagon, later, onto, a, truck, or, tractor, drawn, trailer, for, which, a, sweep, could, be, used, instead, of, pitch, forks, loose, hay, was, transported, to, a, designated, storage, area, typically, a, slightly, elevated, location, to, ensure, proper, drainage, where, it, was, constructed, into, a, haystack, building, the, stack, was, a, skilled, task, as, it, needed, to, be, made, waterproof, during, construction, the, haystack, would, compress, under, its, own, weight, allowing, the, hay, to, cure, through, the, release, of, heat, generated, by, the, residual, moisture, and, compression, forces, the, haystack, was, usually, enclosed, in, a, fenced, off, area, known, as, a, rick, yard, to, separate, it, from, the, rest, of, the, paddock, and, was, often, thatched, or, covered, with, sheets, to, protect, it, from, moisture, when, needed, slices, of, hay, would, be, cut, using, a, hay, knife, and, fed, to, animals, each, day, on, some, farms, the, loose, hay, was, stored, in, a, barrack, shed, or, barn, normally, in, such, a, way, that, it, would, compress, down, and, cure, hay, could, be, stored, in, a, specially, designed, barn, with, little, internal, structure, to, allow, more, room, for, the, hay, loft, alternatively, an, upper, storey, of, a, cow, shed, or, stable, was, used, with, hatches, in, the, floor, to, allow, hay, to, be, thrown, down, into, hay, racks, below, depending, on, the, region, the, term, hay, rick, could, refer, to, the, machine, for, cutting, hay, the, haystack, or, the, wagon, used, to, collect, the, hay, hay, baling, began, with, the, invention, of, the, first, hay, press, in, about, 1850, hay, was, baled, for, easier, handling, and, to, reduce, space, required, for, storage, and, shipment, the, first, bales, weighed, about, 300, pounds, the, original, machines, were, of, a, vertical, design, similar, to, the, one, photographed, by, the, greene, co, historical, society, they, used, a, horse, driven, screw, press, mechanism, or, a, dropped, weight, to, compress, the, hay, the, first, patent, went, to, hl, emery, for, a, horse, powered, screw, operated, hay, press, in, 1853, other, models, were, reported, as, early, as, 1843, built, by, pk, dederick, s, sons, of, albany, new, york, or, samuel, hewitt, of, switzerland, county, indiana, later, horizontal, machines, were, devised, one, was, the, perpetual, press, made, by, pk, dederick, of, albany, in, 1872, they, could, be, powered, by, steam, engines, by, about, 1882, the, continuous, hay, baler, arrived, in, 1914, modern, mechanized, hay, production, today, is, usually, performed, by, a, number, of, machines, while, small, operations, use, a, tractor, to, pull, various, implements, for, mowing, and, raking, larger, operations, use, specialized, machines, such, as, a, mower, or, a, swather, which, are, designed, to, cut, the, hay, and, arrange, it, into, a, windrow, in, one, step, balers, are, usually, pulled, by, a, tractor, with, larger, balers, requiring, more, powerful, tractors, mobile, balers, machines, that, gather, and, bale, hay, in, one, process, were, first, developed, around, 1940, the, initial, balers, produced, rectangular, bales, that, were, small, enough, for, an, individual, to, lift, typically, weighing, between, 70, and, 100, pounds, 32, to, 45, kg, each, the, size, and, shape, of, these, bales, allowed, for, manual, handling, including, lifting, stacking, on, transport, vehicles, and, constructing, a, haystack, by, hand, to, reduce, labor, and, enhance, safety, loaders, and, stackers, were, subsequently, developed, to, mechanize, the, transportation, of, small, bales, from, the, field, to, the, haystack, or, hay, barn, later, in, the, 20th, century, balers, were, developed, capable, of, producing, large, bales, that, weigh, up, to, 3, 000, pounds, 1, 400, kg, conditioning, of, hay, crop, during, cutting, or, soon, thereafter, is, popular, the, basic, idea, is, that, it, decreases, drying, time, particularly, in, humid, climates, or, if, rain, threatens, to, interfere, with, haying, usually, rollers, or, flails, inside, a, mower, conditioner, crimp, crack, or, strip, the, alfalfa, or, grass, stems, to, increase, evaporation, rate, sometimes, a, salt, solution, is, sprayed, over, the, top, of, the, hay, generally, alfalfa, that, helps, to, dry, the, hay, modern, hay, production, often, relies, on, artificial, fertilizer, and, herbicides, traditionally, manure, has, been, used, on, hayfields, but, modern, chemical, fertilizers, are, used, today, as, well, hay, that, is, to, be, certified, as, weed, free, for, use, in, wilderness, areas, must, often, be, sprayed, with, chemical, herbicides, to, keep, unwanted, weeds, from, the, field, and, sometimes, even, non, certified, hayfields, are, sprayed, to, limit, the, production, of, noxious, weeds, organic, forms, of, fertilization, and, weed, control, are, required, for, hay, grown, for, consumption, by, animals, whose, meat, will, ultimately, be, certified, organic, to, that, end, compost, and, field, rotation, can, enhance, soil, fertility, and, regular, mowing, of, fields, in, the, growth, phase, of, the, hay, will, often, reduce, the, prevalence, of, undesired, weeds, in, recent, times, some, producers, have, experimented, with, human, sewage, sludge, to, grow, hay, this, is, not, a, certified, organic, method, and, no, warning, labels, are, mandated, by, epa, one, concern, with, hay, grown, on, human, sewage, sludge, is, that, the, hay, can, take, up, heavy, metals, which, are, then, consumed, by, animals, molybdenum, poisoning, is, a, particular, concern, in, ruminants, such, as, cows, and, goats, and, there, have, been, animal, deaths, another, concern, is, with, a, herbicide, known, as, aminopyralid, which, can, pass, through, the, digestive, tract, in, animals, making, their, resulting, manure, toxic, to, many, plants, and, thus, unsuitable, as, fertilizer, for, food, crops, aminopyralid, and, related, herbicides, can, persist, in, the, environment, for, several, years, small, square, bales, are, made, in, two, main, variations, the, smaller, two, tie, two, twines, to, hold, the, bale, together, or, larger, three, tie, three, twines, to, hold, the, bale, together, they, vary, in, size, within, both, groups, but, are, generally, popular, in, different, markets, the, smaller, two, tie, bales, are, favored, in, the, hobby, animal, market, and, are, preferred, for, their, convenient, size, the, larger, three, tie, bales, are, favored, by, producers, wanting, to, export, bales, because, of, the, increase, of, efficiency, in, transportation, and, also, by, customers, for, a, better, price, per, ton, the, two, tie, small, bales, are, the, original, form, factor, of, hay, bales, balers, for, both, types, of, small, bales, are, still, manufactured, as, well, as, stackers, bundlers, and, bale, accumulators, for, handling, them, there, are, also, some, farms, that, still, use, equipment, manufactured, over, 50, years, ago, to, produce, small, bales, the, small, bale, remains, part, of, overall, ranch, lore, and, tradition, with, hay, bucking, competitions, still, held, for, fun, at, many, rodeos, and, county, fairs, small, square, bales, are, often, stacked, mechanically, or, by, hand, in, a, crisscrossed, fashion, sometimes, called, a, haystack, rick, or, hayrick, rain, tends, to, wash, nutrition, out, of, hay, and, can, cause, spoilage, or, mold, hay, in, small, square, bales, is, particularly, susceptible, to, this, small, bales, are, therefore, often, stored, in, a, haymow, or, hayshed, haystacks, built, outside, are, often, protected, by, tarpaulins, if, this, is, not, done, the, top, two, layers, of, the, stack, are, often, lost, to, rot, and, mold, and, if, the, stack, is, not, arranged, in, a, proper, haystack, moisture, can, seep, even, deeper, into, the, stack, the, rounded, shape, and, tighter, compaction, of, round, bales, make, them, less, susceptible, to, spoilage, as, the, water, is, less, likely, to, penetrate, into, the, bale, the, addition, of, net, wrap, which, is, not, used, on, square, bales, offers, even, greater, weather, resistance, people, who, keep, small, numbers, of, animals, may, prefer, small, bales, that, can, be, handled, by, one, person, without, machinery, there, is, also, a, risk, that, hay, bales, may, be, moldy, or, contain, decaying, carcasses, of, small, creatures, that, were, accidentally, killed, by, baling, equipment, and, swept, up, into, the, bale, which, can, produce, toxins, such, as, botulinum, toxin, both, can, be, deadly, to, non, ruminant, herbivores, such, as, horses, and, when, this, occurs, the, entire, contaminated, bale, generally, is, thrown, out, another, reason, some, people, continue, to, support, the, market, for, small, bales, farmers, who, need, to, make, large, amounts, of, hay, are, likely, to, choose, balers, that, produce, much, larger, bales, maximizing, the, amount, of, hay, that, is, protected, from, the, elements, large, bales, come, in, two, types, round, and, square, large, square, bales, which, can, weigh, up, to, 1, 000, kilograms, 2, 200, lb, can, be, stacked, and, are, easier, to, transport, on, trucks, large, round, bales, which, typically, weigh, 300, to, 400, kilograms, 660, 880, lb, are, more, moisture, resistant, and, pack, the, hay, more, densely, especially, at, the, center, round, bales, are, quickly, fed, with, the, use, of, mechanized, equipment, the, ratio, of, volume, to, surface, area, makes, it, possible, for, many, dry, area, farmers, to, leave, large, bales, outside, until, they, are, consumed, wet, area, farmers, and, those, in, climates, with, heavy, snowfall, can, stack, round, bales, under, a, shed, or, tarp, but, can, also, use, a, light, but, durable, plastic, wrap, that, partially, encloses, bales, left, outside, the, wrap, repels, moisture, but, leaves, the, ends, of, the, bale, exposed, so, that, the, hay, itself, can, breathe, and, does, not, begin, to, ferment, when, it, is, possible, to, store, round, bales, under, a, shed, they, last, longer, and, less, hay, is, lost, to, rot, and, moisture, for, animals, that, eat, silage, a, bale, wrapper, may, be, used, to, seal, a, round, bale, completely, and, trigger, the, fermentation, process, it, is, a, technique, used, as, a, money, saving, process, by, producers, who, do, not, have, access, to, a, superior, silo, and, for, producing, silage, that, is, transported, to, other, locations, in, very, damp, climates, it, is, a, legitimate, alternative, to, drying, hay, completely, and, when, processed, properly, the, natural, fermentation, process, prevents, mold, and, rot, round, bale, silage, is, also, sometimes, called, haylage, and, is, seen, more, commonly, in, europe, than, in, either, the, united, states, or, australia, hay, stored, in, this, fashion, must, remain, completely, sealed, in, plastic, as, any, holes, or, tears, will, allow, the, entrance, of, oxygen, and, can, stop, the, preservation, properties, of, fermentation, and, lead, to, spoilage, hay, requires, protection, from, the, weather, and, is, optimally, stored, inside, buildings, 89, but, weather, protection, is, also, provided, in, other, ways, involving, outdoor, storage, either, in, haystacks, or, in, large, tight, bales, round, or, rectangular, these, methods, all, depend, on, the, surface, of, an, outdoor, mass, of, hay, stack, or, bale, taking, the, hit, of, the, weather, and, thereby, preserving, the, main, body, of, hay, underneath, traditionally, outdoor, hay, storage, was, done, with, haystacks, of, loose, hay, where, most, of, the, hay, was, sufficiently, preserved, to, last, through, the, winter, and, the, top, surface, of, the, stack, being, weathered, was, consigned, to, become, compost, the, next, summer, the, term, loose, means, not, pressed, or, baled, but, does, not, necessarily, mean, a, light, fluffy, lay, of, randomly, oriented, stems, especially, in, wet, climates, such, as, those, of, britain, the, degree, of, shedding, of, rainwater, by, the, stack, s, outer, surface, is, an, important, factor, and, the, stacking, of, loose, hay, was, developed, into, a, skilled, labor, task, that, in, its, more, advanced, forms, even, involved, thatching, the, top, in, many, stacking, methods, with, or, without, thatched, tops, stems, were, oriented, in, sheaves, which, were, laid, in, oriented, sequence, with, the, advent, of, large, bales, since, the, 1960s, today, hay, is, often, stored, outdoors, because, the, outer, surface, of, the, large, bale, performs, the, weather, shedding, function, the, large, bales, can, also, be, stacked, which, allows, a, given, degree, of, exposed, surface, area, to, count, for, a, larger, volume, of, protected, interior, hay, plastic, tarpaulins, are, sometimes, used, to, shed, the, rain, with, the, goal, of, reduced, hay, wastage, but, the, cost, of, the, tarpaulins, must, be, weighed, against, the, cost, of, the, hay, spoilage, percentage, difference, it, may, not, be, worth, the, cost, or, the, plastic, s, environmental, footprint, after, world, war, ii, british, farmers, found, that, the, demand, outstripped, supply, for, skilled, farm, laborers, experienced, in, the, thatching, of, haystacks, this, no, doubt, contributed, to, the, pressure, for, baling, in, large, bales, to, increasingly, replace, stacking, which, was, happening, anyway, as, haymaking, technology, like, other, farm, technology, continued, toward, extensive, mechanization, with, one, person, operation, of, many, tasks, today, tons, of, hay, can, be, cut, conditioned, dried, raked, and, baled, by, one, person, as, long, as, the, right, equipment, is, at, hand, although, that, equipment, is, expensive, these, tons, of, hay, can, also, be, moved, by, one, person, again, with, the, right, expensive, equipment, as, loaders, with, long, spikes, run, by, hydraulic, circuits, pick, up, each, large, bale, and, move, it, to, its, feeding, location, a, fence, may, be, built, to, enclose, a, haystack, and, prevent, roaming, animals, from, eating, it, or, animals, may, feed, directly, from, a, field, constructed, stack, as, part, of, their, winter, feeding, haystacks, are, also, sometimes, called, haycocks, among, some, users, this, term, refers, more, specifically, to, small, piles, of, cut, and, gathered, hay, awaiting, stacking, into, larger, stacks, the, words, haystack, haycock, are, usually, styled, as, solid, compounds, but, not, always, haystacks, are, also, sometimes, called, stooks, shocks, or, ricks, loose, stacks, are, built, to, prevent, the, accumulation, of, moisture, and, promote, drying, or, curing, in, some, places, this, is, accomplished, by, constructing, stacks, with, a, conical, or, ridged, top, the, exterior, may, look, gray, on, the, surface, after, weathering, but, the, inner, hay, retains, traces, of, its, fresh, cut, aroma, and, maintains, a, faded, green, tint, they, can, be, covered, with, thatch, or, kept, within, a, protective, structure, one, such, structure, is, a, moveable, roof, supported, by, four, posts, historically, called, a, dutch, roof, hay, barrack, or, hay, cap, haystacks, may, also, be, built, on, top, of, a, foundation, laid, on, the, ground, to, reduce, spoilage, in, some, places, made, of, wood, or, brush, in, other, areas, hay, is, stacked, loose, built, around, a, central, pole, a, tree, or, within, an, area, of, three, or, four, poles, to, add, stability, to, the, stack, one, loose, hay, stacking, technique, seen, in, the, british, isles, is, to, initially, stack, freshly, cut, hay, into, smaller, mounds, called, foot, cocks, hay, coles, kyles, hayshocks, or, haycocks, to, facilitate, initial, curing, these, are, sometimes, built, atop, platforms, or, tripods, formed, of, three, poles, used, to, keep, hay, off, the, ground, and, let, air, into, the, center, for, better, drying, the, shape, causes, dew, and, rainwater, to, roll, down, the, sides, allowing, the, hay, within, to, cure, people, who, handle, the, hay, may, use, hayforks, or, pitchforks, to, move, or, pitch, the, hay, in, building, haycocks, and, haystacks, construction, of, tall, haystacks, is, sometimes, aided, with, a, ramp, ranging, from, simple, poles, to, a, device, for, building, large, loose, stacks, called, a, beaverslide, hay, is, generally, one, of, the, safest, feeds, to, provide, to, domesticated, grazing, herbivores, amounts, must, be, monitored, so, animals, do, not, get, too, fat, or, too, thin, supplemental, feed, may, be, required, for, working, animals, with, high, energy, requirements, animals, who, eat, spoiled, hay, may, develop, a, variety, of, illnesses, from, coughs, related, to, dust, and, mold, to, various, other, illnesses, the, most, serious, of, which, may, be, botulism, which, can, occur, if, a, small, animal, such, as, a, rodent, or, snake, is, killed, by, the, baling, equipment, then, rots, inside, the, bale, causing, a, toxin, to, form, some, animals, are, sensitive, to, particular, fungi, or, molds, that, may, grow, on, living, plants, for, example, an, endophytic, fungus, that, sometimes, grows, on, fescue, can, cause, abortion, in, pregnant, mares, some, plants, themselves, may, also, be, toxic, to, some, animals, for, example, pimelea, a, native, australian, plant, also, known, as, flax, weed, is, highly, toxic, to, cattle, farmer, s, lung, is, a, hypersensitivity, pneumonitis, induced, by, the, inhalation, of, biologic, dusts, coming, from, hay, dust, or, mold, spores, or, other, agricultural, products, exposure, to, hay, can, also, trigger, allergic, rhinitis, for, people, who, are, hypersensitive, to, airborne, allergens, hay, must, be, fully, dried, when, baled, and, kept, dry, in, storage, if, hay, is, baled, while, too, moist, or, becomes, wet, while, in, storage, there, is, a, significant, risk, of, spontaneous, combustion, hay, stored, outside, must, be, stacked, in, such, a, way, that, moisture, contact, is, minimal, some, stacks, are, arranged, in, such, a, manner, that, the, hay, itself, sheds, water, when, it, falls, other, methods, of, stacking, use, the, first, layers, or, bales, of, hay, as, a, cover, to, protect, the, rest, to, completely, keep, out, moisture, outside, haystacks, can, also, be, covered, by, tarps, and, many, round, bales, are, partially, wrapped, in, plastic, as, part, of, the, baling, process, hay, is, also, stored, under, a, roof, when, resources, permit, it, is, frequently, placed, inside, sheds, or, stacked, inside, of, a, barn, on, the, other, hand, care, must, also, be, taken, that, hay, is, never, exposed, to, any, possible, source, of, heat, or, flame, as, dry, hay, and, the, dust, it, produces, are, highly, flammable, hay, baled, before, it, is, fully, dry, can, produce, enough, heat, to, start, a, fire, haystacks, produce, internal, heat, due, to, bacterial, fermentation, if, hay, is, stacked, with, wet, grass, the, heat, produced, can, be, sufficient, to, ignite, the, hay, causing, a, fire, farmers, have, to, be, careful, about, moisture, levels, to, avoid, spontaneous, combustion, which, is, a, leading, cause, of, haystack, fires, heat, is, produced, by, the, respiration, process, which, occurs, until, the, moisture, content, of, drying, hay, drops, below, 40, hay, is, considered, fully, dry, when, it, reaches, 20, moisture, combustion, problems, typically, occur, within, five, to, seven, days, of, baling, a, bale, cooler, than, 120, f, 49, c, is, in, little, danger, but, bales, between, 120, and, 140, f, 49, and, 60, c, need, to, be, removed, from, a, barn, or, structure, and, separated, so, that, they, can, cool, off, if, the, temperature, of, a, bale, exceeds, more, than, 140, f, 60, c, it, can, combust, to, check, hay, moisture, content, the, farmer, can, use, a, hand, an, oven, or, a, moisture, tester, the, most, efficient, way, is, to, use, a, moisture, tester, which, shows, the, moisture, content, in, a, few, seconds, due, to, its, weight, hay, can, cause, a, number, of, injuries, to, humans, particularly, those, related, to, lifting, and, moving, bales, as, well, as, risks, related, to, stacking, and, storing, hazards, include, the, danger, of, having, a, poorly, constructed, stack, collapse, causing, either, falls, to, people, on, the, stack, or, injuries, to, people, on, the, ground, who, are, struck, by, falling, bales, large, round, hay, bales, present, a, particular, danger, to, those, who, handle, them, because, they, can, weigh, over, 1, 000, pounds, 450, kg, and, cannot, be, moved, without, special, equipment, nonetheless, because, they, are, cylindrical, in, shape, and, thus, can, roll, easily, it, is, not, uncommon, for, them, to, fall, from, stacks, or, roll, off, the, equipment, used, to, handle, them, from, 1992, to, 1998, 74, farm, workers, in, the, united, states, were, killed, in, large, round, hay, bale, accidents, usually, when, bales, were, being, moved, from, one, location, to, another, such, as, when, feeding, animals, texts, on, wikisource
