a, defensive, wall, is, a, fortification, usually, used, to, protect, a, city, town, or, other, settlement, from, potential, aggressors, the, walls, can, range, from, simple, palisades, or, earthworks, to, extensive, military, fortifications, such, as, curtain, walls, with, towers, bastions, and, gates, for, access, to, the, city, from, ancient, to, modern, times, they, were, used, to, enclose, settlements, generally, these, are, referred, to, as, city, walls, or, town, walls, although, there, were, also, walls, such, as, the, great, wall, of, china, walls, of, benin, hadrian, s, wall, anastasian, wall, and, the, atlantic, wall, which, extended, far, beyond, the, borders, of, a, city, and, were, used, to, enclose, regions, or, mark, territorial, boundaries, in, mountainous, terrain, defensive, walls, such, as, letzis, were, used, in, combination, with, castles, to, seal, valleys, from, potential, attack, beyond, their, defensive, utility, many, walls, also, had, important, symbolic, functions, representing, the, status, and, independence, of, the, communities, they, embraced, existing, ancient, walls, are, almost, always, masonry, structures, although, brick, and, timber, built, variants, are, also, known, depending, on, the, topography, of, the, area, surrounding, the, city, or, the, settlement, the, wall, is, intended, to, protect, elements, of, the, terrain, such, as, rivers, or, coastlines, may, be, incorporated, in, order, to, make, the, wall, more, effective, walls, may, only, be, crossed, by, entering, the, appropriate, city, gate, and, are, often, supplemented, with, towers, the, practice, of, building, these, massive, walls, though, having, its, origins, in, prehistory, was, refined, during, the, rise, of, city, states, and, energetic, wall, building, continued, into, the, medieval, period, and, beyond, in, certain, parts, of, europe, simpler, defensive, walls, of, earth, or, stone, thrown, up, around, hillforts, ringworks, early, castles, and, the, like, tend, to, be, referred, to, as, ramparts, or, banks, from, very, early, history, to, modern, times, walls, have, been, a, near, necessity, for, every, city, uruk, in, ancient, sumer, mesopotamia, is, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, known, walled, cities, before, that, the, proto, city, of, jericho, in, the, west, bank, had, a, wall, surrounding, it, as, early, as, the, 8th, millennium, bc, the, earliest, known, town, wall, in, europe, is, of, solnitsata, built, in, the, 6th, or, 5th, millennium, bc, the, assyrians, deployed, large, labour, forces, to, build, new, palaces, temples, and, defensive, walls, babylon, was, one, of, the, most, famous, cities, of, the, ancient, world, especially, as, a, result, of, the, building, program, of, nebuchadnezzar, who, expanded, the, walls, and, built, the, ishtar, gate, the, persians, built, defensive, walls, to, protect, their, territories, notably, the, derbent, wall, and, the, great, wall, of, gorgan, built, on, the, either, sides, of, the, caspian, sea, against, nomadic, nations, some, settlements, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, were, also, fortified, by, about, 3500, bc, hundreds, of, small, farming, villages, dotted, the, indus, floodplain, many, of, these, settlements, had, fortifications, and, planned, streets, the, stone, and, mud, brick, houses, of, kot, diji, were, clustered, behind, massive, stone, flood, dykes, and, defensive, walls, for, neighboring, communities, quarreled, constantly, about, the, control, of, prime, agricultural, land, mundigak, c, 2500, bc, in, present, day, south, east, afghanistan, has, defensive, walls, and, square, bastions, of, sun, dried, bricks, the, concept, of, a, city, fully, enclosed, by, walls, was, not, fully, developed, in, southeast, asia, until, the, arrival, of, europeans, however, burma, serves, an, exception, as, they, had, a, longer, tradition, of, fortified, walled, towns, towns, in, burma, had, city, walls, by, 1566, besides, that, rangoon, in, 1755, had, stockades, made, of, teak, logs, on, a, ground, rampart, the, city, was, fortified, with, six, city, gates, with, each, gate, flanked, by, massive, brick, towers, in, other, areas, of, southeast, asia, city, walls, spread, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, along, with, the, rapid, growth, of, cities, in, this, period, as, a, need, to, defend, against, european, naval, attack, ayutthaya, built, its, walls, in, 1550, and, banten, jepara, tuban, and, surabaya, all, had, theirs, by, 1600, while, makassar, had, theirs, by, 1634, a, sea, wall, was, the, main, defense, for, gelgel, for, cities, that, did, not, have, city, walls, the, least, it, would, have, had, was, a, stockaded, citadel, this, wooden, walled, area, housed, the, royal, citadel, or, aristocratic, compounds, such, as, in, surakarta, and, aceh, large, rammed, earth, walls, were, built, in, ancient, china, since, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, 1050, bc, as, the, capital, at, ancient, ao, had, enormous, walls, built, in, this, fashion, see, siege, for, more, info, although, stone, walls, were, built, in, china, during, the, warring, states, 481, 221, bc, mass, conversion, to, stone, architecture, did, not, begin, in, earnest, until, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, sections, of, the, great, wall, had, been, built, prior, to, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 207, bc, and, subsequently, connected, and, fortified, during, the, qin, dynasty, although, its, present, form, was, mostly, an, engineering, feat, and, remodeling, of, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, ad, the, large, walls, of, pingyao, serve, as, one, example, likewise, the, walls, of, the, forbidden, city, in, beijing, were, established, in, the, early, 15th, century, by, the, yongle, emperor, according, to, tonio, andrade, the, immense, thickness, of, chinese, city, walls, prevented, larger, cannons, from, being, developed, since, even, industrial, era, artillery, had, trouble, breaching, chinese, walls, eupseongs, hangul, city, fortresses, which, served, both, military, and, administrative, functions, have, been, constructed, since, the, time, of, silla, until, the, end, of, the, joseon, dynasty, throughout, the, period, of, the, joseon, dynasty, eupseongs, were, modified, and, renovated, and, new, eupseongs, were, built, but, in, 1910, japan, the, occupying, power, of, korea, issued, an, order, for, their, demolition, resulting, in, most, being, destroyed, studies, of, the, ruins, and, reconstructions, of, the, ancient, city, walls, are, currently, being, undertaken, at, some, sites, in, ancient, greece, large, stone, walls, had, been, built, in, mycenaean, greece, such, as, the, ancient, site, of, mycenae, famous, for, the, huge, stone, blocks, of, its, cyclopean, walls, in, classical, era, greece, the, city, of, athens, built, a, long, set, of, parallel, stone, walls, called, the, long, walls, that, reached, their, guarded, seaport, at, piraeus, exceptions, were, few, but, neither, ancient, sparta, nor, ancient, rome, had, walls, for, a, long, time, choosing, to, rely, on, their, militaries, for, defense, instead, initially, these, fortifications, were, simple, constructions, of, wood, and, earth, which, were, later, replaced, by, mixed, constructions, of, stones, piled, on, top, of, each, other, without, mortar, the, romans, later, fortified, their, cities, with, massive, mortar, bound, stone, walls, among, these, are, the, largely, extant, aurelian, walls, of, rome, and, the, theodosian, walls, of, constantinople, together, with, partial, remains, elsewhere, these, are, mostly, city, gates, like, the, porta, nigra, in, trier, or, newport, arch, in, lincoln, in, central, europe, the, celts, built, large, fortified, settlements, which, the, romans, called, oppida, whose, walls, seem, partially, influenced, by, those, built, in, the, mediterranean, the, fortifications, were, continuously, expanded, and, improved, apart, from, these, the, early, middle, ages, also, saw, the, creation, of, some, towns, built, around, castles, these, cities, were, only, rarely, protected, by, simple, stone, walls, and, more, usually, by, a, combination, of, both, walls, and, ditches, from, the, 12th, century, ad, hundreds, of, settlements, of, all, sizes, were, founded, all, across, europe, which, very, often, obtained, the, right, of, fortification, soon, afterwards, several, medieval, town, walls, have, survived, into, the, modern, age, such, as, the, walled, towns, of, austria, walls, of, tallinn, or, the, town, walls, of, york, and, canterbury, in, england, as, well, as, nordlingen, dinkelsb, hl, and, rothenburg, ob, der, tauber, in, germany, in, spain, avila, and, tossa, del, mar, hosts, surviving, medieval, walls, while, lugo, has, an, intact, roman, wall, the, founding, of, urban, centers, was, an, important, means, of, territorial, expansion, and, many, cities, especially, in, central, and, eastern, europe, were, founded, for, this, purpose, during, the, period, of, eastern, settlement, these, cities, are, easy, to, recognise, due, to, their, regular, layout, and, large, market, spaces, the, fortifications, of, these, settlements, were, continuously, improved, to, reflect, the, current, level, of, military, development, while, gunpowder, and, cannons, were, invented, in, china, china, never, developed, wall, breaking, artillery, to, the, same, extent, as, other, parts, of, the, world, part, of, the, reason, is, probably, because, chinese, walls, were, already, highly, resistant, to, artillery, and, discouraged, increasing, the, size, of, cannons, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, a, european, expert, in, fortification, commented, on, their, immensity, in, china, the, principal, towns, are, surrounded, to, the, present, day, by, walls, so, substantial, lofty, and, formidable, that, the, medieval, fortifications, of, europe, are, puny, in, comparison, chinese, walls, were, thick, the, eastern, wall, of, ancient, linzi, established, in, 859, bc, had, a, maximum, thickness, of, 43, metres, and, an, average, thickness, of, 20, 30, metres, ming, prefectural, and, provincial, capital, walls, were, 10, to, 20, metres, 33, to, 66, ft, thick, at, the, base, and, 5, to, 10, metres, 16, to, 33, ft, at, the, top, in, europe, the, height, of, wall, construction, was, reached, under, the, roman, empire, whose, walls, often, reached, 10, metres, 33, ft, in, height, the, same, as, many, chinese, city, walls, but, were, only, 1, 5, to, 2, 5, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, to, 8, ft, 2, in, thick, rome, s, servian, walls, reached, 3, 6, and, 4, metres, 12, and, 13, ft, in, thickness, and, 6, to, 10, metres, 20, to, 33, ft, in, height, other, fortifications, also, reached, these, specifications, across, the, empire, but, all, these, paled, in, comparison, to, contemporary, chinese, walls, which, could, reach, a, thickness, of, 20, metres, 66, ft, at, the, base, in, extreme, cases, even, the, walls, of, constantinople, which, have, been, described, as, the, most, famous, and, complicated, system, of, defence, in, the, civilized, world, could, not, match, up, to, a, major, chinese, city, wall, had, both, the, outer, and, inner, walls, of, constantinople, been, combined, they, would, have, only, reached, roughly, a, bit, more, than, a, third, the, width, of, a, major, wall, in, china, according, to, philo, the, width, of, a, wall, had, to, be, 4, 5, metres, 15, ft, thick, to, be, able, to, withstand, ancient, non, gunpowder, siege, engines, european, walls, of, the, 1200s, and, 1300s, could, reach, the, roman, equivalents, but, rarely, exceeded, them, in, length, width, and, height, remaining, around, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, thick, when, referring, to, a, very, thick, wall, in, medieval, europe, what, is, usually, meant, is, a, wall, of, 2, 5, metres, 8, ft, 2, in, in, width, which, would, have, been, considered, thin, in, a, chinese, context, there, are, some, exceptions, such, as, the, hillfort, of, otzenhausen, a, celtic, ringfort, with, a, thickness, of, 40, metres, 130, ft, in, some, parts, but, celtic, fort, building, practices, died, out, in, the, early, medieval, period, andrade, goes, on, to, note, that, the, walls, of, the, marketplace, of, chang, an, were, thicker, than, the, walls, of, major, european, capitals, aside, from, their, immense, size, chinese, walls, were, also, structurally, different, from, the, ones, built, in, medieval, europe, whereas, european, walls, were, mostly, constructed, of, stone, interspersed, with, gravel, or, rubble, filling, and, bonded, by, limestone, mortar, chinese, walls, had, tamped, earthen, cores, which, absorbed, the, energy, of, artillery, shots, walls, were, constructed, using, wooden, frameworks, which, were, filled, with, layers, of, earth, tamped, down, to, a, highly, compact, state, and, once, that, was, completed, the, frameworks, were, removed, for, use, in, the, next, wall, section, starting, from, the, song, dynasty, these, walls, were, improved, with, an, outer, layer, of, bricks, or, stone, to, prevent, erosion, and, during, the, ming, earthworks, were, interspersed, with, stone, and, rubble, most, chinese, walls, were, also, sloped, rather, than, vertical, to, better, deflect, projectile, energy, the, defensive, response, to, cannon, in, europe, was, to, build, relatively, low, and, thick, walls, of, packed, earth, which, could, both, withstand, the, force, of, cannon, balls, and, support, their, own, defensive, cannon, chinese, wall, building, practice, was, by, happenstance, extremely, resistant, to, all, forms, of, battering, this, held, true, into, the, twentieth, century, when, even, modern, explosive, shells, had, some, difficulty, in, breaking, through, tamped, earth, walls, the, chinese, wall, theory, essentially, rests, on, a, cost, benefit, hypothesis, where, the, ming, recognized, the, highly, resistant, nature, of, their, walls, to, structural, damage, and, could, not, imagine, any, affordable, development, of, the, guns, available, to, them, at, the, time, to, be, capable, of, breaching, said, walls, even, as, late, as, the, 1490s, a, florentine, diplomat, considered, the, french, claim, that, their, artillery, is, capable, of, creating, a, breach, in, a, wall, of, eight, feet, in, thickness, to, be, ridiculous, and, the, french, braggarts, by, nature, very, rarely, did, cannons, blast, breaches, in, city, walls, in, chinese, warfare, this, may, have, been, partly, due, to, cultural, tradition, famous, military, commanders, such, as, sun, tzu, and, zheng, zhilong, recommended, not, to, directly, attack, cities, and, storm, their, walls, even, when, direct, assaults, were, made, with, cannons, it, was, usually, by, focusing, on, the, gates, rather, than, the, walls, there, were, instances, where, cannons, were, used, against, walled, fortifications, such, as, by, koxinga, but, only, in, the, case, of, small, villages, during, koxinga, s, career, there, is, only, one, recorded, case, of, capturing, a, settlement, by, bombarding, its, walls, the, siege, of, taizhou, in, 1658, in, 1662, the, dutch, found, that, bombarding, the, walls, of, a, town, in, fujian, province, had, no, effect, and, they, focused, on, the, gates, instead, just, as, in, chinese, warfare, in, 1841, a, 74, gun, british, warship, bombarded, a, chinese, coastal, fort, near, guangzhou, and, found, that, it, was, almost, impervious, to, the, efforts, of, horizontal, fire, in, fact, twentieth, century, explosive, shells, had, some, difficulty, creating, a, breach, in, tamped, earthen, walls, we, fought, our, way, to, nanking, and, joined, in, the, attack, on, the, enemy, capital, in, december, it, was, our, unit, which, stormed, the, chunghua, gate, we, attacked, continuously, for, about, a, week, battering, the, brick, and, earth, walls, with, artillery, but, they, never, collapsed, the, night, of, december, 11, men, in, my, unit, breached, the, wall, the, morning, came, with, most, of, our, unit, still, behind, us, but, we, were, beyond, the, wall, behind, the, gate, great, heaps, of, sandbags, were, piled, up, we, cleared, them, away, removed, the, lock, and, opened, the, gates, with, a, great, creaking, noise, we, d, done, it, we, d, opened, the, fortress, all, the, enemy, ran, away, so, we, didn, t, take, any, fire, the, residents, too, were, gone, when, we, passed, beyond, the, fortress, wall, we, thought, we, had, occupied, this, city, as, a, response, to, gunpowder, artillery, european, fortifications, began, displaying, architectural, principles, such, as, lower, and, thicker, walls, in, the, mid, 1400s, cannon, towers, were, built, with, artillery, rooms, where, cannons, could, discharge, fire, from, slits, in, the, walls, however, this, proved, problematic, as, the, slow, rate, of, fire, reverberating, concussions, and, noxious, fumes, produced, greatly, hindered, defenders, gun, towers, also, limited, the, size, and, number, of, cannon, placements, because, the, rooms, could, only, be, built, so, big, notable, surviving, artillery, towers, include, a, seven, layer, defensive, structure, built, in, 1480, at, foug, res, in, brittany, and, a, four, layer, tower, built, in, 1479, at, querfurth, in, saxony, the, star, fort, also, known, as, the, bastion, fort, trace, italienne, or, renaissance, fortress, was, a, style, of, fortification, that, became, popular, in, europe, during, the, 16th, century, the, bastion, and, star, fort, was, developed, in, italy, where, the, florentine, engineer, giuliano, da, sangallo, 1445, 1516, compiled, a, comprehensive, defensive, plan, using, the, geometric, bastion, and, full, trace, italienne, that, became, widespread, in, europe, the, main, distinguishing, features, of, the, star, fort, were, its, angle, bastions, each, placed, to, support, their, neighbor, with, lethal, crossfire, covering, all, angles, making, them, extremely, difficult, to, engage, with, and, attack, angle, bastions, consisted, of, two, faces, and, two, flanks, artillery, positions, positioned, at, the, flanks, could, fire, parallel, into, the, opposite, bastion, s, line, of, fire, thus, providing, two, lines, of, cover, fire, against, an, armed, assault, on, the, wall, and, preventing, mining, parties, from, finding, refuge, meanwhile, artillery, positioned, on, the, bastion, platform, could, fire, frontally, from, the, two, faces, also, providing, overlapping, fire, with, the, opposite, bastion, overlapping, mutually, supporting, defensive, fire, was, the, greatest, advantage, enjoyed, by, the, star, fort, as, a, result, sieges, lasted, longer, and, became, more, difficult, affairs, by, the, 1530s, the, bastion, fort, had, become, the, dominant, defensive, structure, in, italy, outside, europe, the, star, fort, became, an, engine, of, european, expansion, and, acted, as, a, force, multiplier, so, that, small, european, garrisons, could, hold, out, against, numerically, superior, forces, wherever, star, forts, were, erected, the, natives, experienced, great, difficulty, in, uprooting, european, invaders, in, china, sun, yuanhua, advocated, for, the, construction, of, angled, bastion, forts, in, his, xifashenji, so, that, their, cannons, could, better, support, each, other, the, officials, han, yun, and, han, lin, noted, that, cannons, on, square, forts, could, not, support, each, side, as, well, as, bastion, forts, their, efforts, to, construct, bastion, forts, and, their, results, were, limited, ma, weicheng, built, two, bastion, forts, in, his, home, county, which, helped, fend, off, a, qing, incursion, in, 1638, by, 1641, there, were, ten, bastion, forts, in, the, county, before, bastion, forts, could, spread, any, further, the, ming, dynasty, fell, in, 1644, and, they, were, largely, forgotten, as, the, qing, dynasty, was, on, the, offensive, most, of, the, time, and, had, no, use, for, them, in, the, wake, of, city, growth, and, the, ensuing, change, of, defensive, strategy, focusing, more, on, the, defense, of, forts, around, cities, many, city, walls, were, demolished, also, the, invention, of, gunpowder, rendered, walls, less, effective, as, siege, cannons, could, then, be, used, to, blast, through, walls, allowing, armies, to, simply, march, through, today, the, presence, of, former, city, fortifications, can, often, only, be, deduced, from, the, presence, of, ditches, ring, roads, or, parks, furthermore, some, street, names, hint, at, the, presence, of, fortifications, in, times, past, for, example, when, words, such, as, wall, or, glacis, occur, in, the, 19th, century, less, emphasis, was, placed, on, preserving, the, fortifications, for, the, sake, of, their, architectural, or, historical, value, on, the, one, hand, complete, fortifications, were, restored, carcassonne, on, the, other, hand, many, structures, were, demolished, in, an, effort, to, modernize, the, cities, one, exception, to, this, is, the, monument, preservation, law, by, the, bavarian, king, ludwig, i, of, bavaria, which, led, to, the, nearly, complete, preservation, of, many, monuments, such, as, the, rothenburg, ob, der, tauber, n, rdlingen, and, dinkelsb, hl, the, countless, small, fortified, towns, in, the, franconia, region, were, also, preserved, as, a, consequence, of, this, edict, walls, and, fortified, wall, structures, were, still, built, in, the, modern, era, they, did, not, however, have, the, original, purpose, of, being, a, structure, able, to, resist, a, prolonged, siege, or, bombardment, modern, examples, of, defensive, walls, include, additionally, in, some, countries, different, embassies, may, be, grouped, together, in, a, single, embassy, district, enclosed, by, a, fortified, complex, with, walls, and, towers, this, usually, occurs, in, regions, where, the, embassies, run, a, high, risk, of, being, target, of, attacks, an, early, example, of, such, a, compound, was, the, legation, quarter, in, beijing, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, most, of, these, modern, city, walls, are, made, of, steel, and, concrete, vertical, concrete, plates, are, put, together, so, as, to, allow, the, least, space, in, between, them, and, are, rooted, firmly, in, the, ground, the, top, of, the, wall, is, often, protruding, and, beset, with, barbed, wire, in, order, to, make, climbing, them, more, difficult, these, walls, are, usually, built, in, straight, lines, and, covered, by, watchtowers, at, the, corners, double, walls, with, an, interstitial, zone, of, fire, as, the, former, berlin, wall, had, are, now, rare, in, september, 2014, ukraine, announced, the, construction, of, the, european, rampart, alongside, its, border, with, russia, to, be, able, to, successfully, apply, for, a, visa, free, movement, with, the, european, union, at, its, simplest, a, defensive, wall, consists, of, a, wall, enclosure, and, its, gates, for, the, most, part, the, top, of, the, walls, were, accessible, with, the, outside, of, the, walls, having, tall, parapets, with, embrasures, or, merlons, north, of, the, alps, this, passageway, at, the, top, of, the, walls, occasionally, had, a, roof, in, addition, to, this, many, different, enhancements, were, made, over, the, course, of, the, centuries, the, defensive, towers, of, west, and, south, european, fortifications, in, the, middle, ages, were, often, very, regularly, and, uniformly, constructed, cf, vila, provins, whereas, central, european, city, walls, tend, to, show, a, variety, of, different, styles, in, these, cases, the, gate, and, wall, towers, often, reach, up, to, considerable, heights, and, gates, equipped, with, two, towers, on, either, side, are, much, rarer, apart, from, having, a, purely, military, and, defensive, purpose, towers, also, played, a, representative, and, artistic, role, in, the, conception, of, a, fortified, complex, the, architecture, of, the, city, thus, competed, with, that, of, the, castle, of, the, noblemen, and, city, walls, were, often, a, manifestation, of, the, pride, of, a, particular, city, urban, areas, outside, the, city, walls, so, called, vorst, dte, were, often, enclosed, by, their, own, set, of, walls, and, integrated, into, the, defense, of, the, city, these, areas, were, often, inhabited, by, the, poorer, population, and, held, the, noxious, trades, in, many, cities, a, new, wall, was, built, once, the, city, had, grown, outside, of, the, old, wall, this, can, often, still, be, seen, in, the, layout, of, the, city, for, example, in, n, rdlingen, and, sometimes, even, a, few, of, the, old, gate, towers, are, preserved, such, as, the, white, tower, in, nuremberg, additional, constructions, prevented, the, circumvention, of, the, city, through, which, many, important, trade, routes, passed, thus, ensuring, that, tolls, were, paid, when, the, caravans, passed, through, the, city, gates, and, that, the, local, market, was, visited, by, the, trade, caravans, furthermore, additional, signaling, and, observation, towers, were, frequently, built, outside, the, city, and, were, sometimes, fortified, in, a, castle, like, fashion, the, border, of, the, area, of, influence, of, the, city, was, often, partially, or, fully,
