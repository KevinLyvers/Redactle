sustainable, agriculture, is, farming, in, sustainable, ways, meeting, society, s, present, food, and, textile, needs, without, compromising, the, ability, for, current, or, future, generations, to, meet, their, needs, it, can, be, based, on, an, understanding, of, ecosystem, services, there, are, many, methods, to, increase, the, sustainability, of, agriculture, when, developing, agriculture, within, sustainable, food, systems, it, is, important, to, develop, flexible, business, processes, and, farming, practices, agriculture, has, an, enormous, environmental, footprint, playing, a, significant, role, in, causing, climate, change, food, systems, are, responsible, for, one, third, of, the, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, water, scarcity, water, pollution, land, degradation, deforestation, and, other, processes, it, is, simultaneously, causing, environmental, changes, and, being, impacted, by, these, changes, sustainable, agriculture, consists, of, environment, friendly, methods, of, farming, that, allow, the, production, of, crops, or, livestock, without, causing, damage, to, human, or, natural, systems, it, involves, preventing, adverse, effects, on, soil, water, biodiversity, and, surrounding, or, downstream, resources, as, well, as, to, those, working, or, living, on, the, farm, or, in, neighboring, areas, elements, of, sustainable, agriculture, can, include, permaculture, agroforestry, mixed, farming, multiple, cropping, and, crop, rotation, developing, sustainable, food, systems, contributes, to, the, sustainability, of, the, human, population, for, example, one, of, the, best, ways, to, mitigate, climate, change, is, to, create, sustainable, food, systems, based, on, sustainable, agriculture, sustainable, agriculture, provides, a, potential, solution, to, enable, agricultural, systems, to, feed, a, growing, population, within, the, changing, environmental, conditions, besides, sustainable, farming, practices, dietary, shifts, to, sustainable, diets, are, an, intertwined, way, to, substantially, reduce, environmental, impacts, numerous, sustainability, standards, and, certification, systems, exist, including, organic, certification, rainforest, alliance, fair, trade, utz, certified, globalgap, bird, friendly, and, the, common, code, for, the, coffee, community, 4c, the, term, sustainable, agriculture, was, defined, in, 1977, by, the, usda, as, an, integrated, system, of, plant, and, animal, production, practices, having, a, site, specific, application, that, will, over, the, long, term, yet, the, idea, of, having, a, sustainable, relationship, with, the, land, has, been, prevalent, in, indigenous, communities, for, centuries, before, the, term, was, formally, added, to, the, lexicon, a, common, consensus, is, that, sustainable, farming, is, the, most, realistic, way, to, feed, growing, populations, in, order, to, successfully, feed, the, population, of, the, planet, farming, practices, must, consider, future, costs, to, both, the, environment, and, the, communities, they, fuel, the, risk, of, not, being, able, to, provide, enough, resources, for, everyone, led, to, the, adoption, of, technology, within, the, sustainability, field, to, increase, farm, productivity, the, ideal, end, result, of, this, advancement, is, the, ability, to, feed, ever, growing, populations, across, the, world, the, growing, popularity, of, sustainable, agriculture, is, connected, to, the, wide, reaching, fear, that, the, planet, s, carrying, capacity, or, planetary, boundaries, in, terms, of, the, ability, to, feed, humanity, has, been, reached, or, even, exceeded, there, are, several, key, principles, associated, with, sustainability, in, agriculture, it, considers, long, term, as, well, as, short, term, economics, because, sustainability, is, readily, defined, as, forever, that, is, agricultural, environments, that, are, designed, to, promote, endless, regeneration, it, balances, the, need, for, resource, conservation, with, the, needs, of, farmers, pursuing, their, livelihood, it, is, considered, to, be, reconciliation, ecology, accommodating, biodiversity, within, human, landscapes, oftentimes, the, execution, of, sustainable, practices, within, farming, comes, through, the, adoption, of, technology, and, environmentally, focused, appropriate, technology, practices, that, can, cause, long, term, damage, to, soil, include, excessive, tilling, of, the, soil, leading, to, erosion, and, irrigation, without, adequate, drainage, leading, to, salinization, the, most, important, factors, for, a, farming, site, are, climate, soil, nutrients, and, water, resources, of, the, four, water, and, soil, conservation, are, the, most, amenable, to, human, intervention, when, farmers, grow, and, harvest, crops, they, remove, some, nutrients, from, the, soil, without, replenishment, the, land, suffers, from, nutrient, depletion, and, becomes, either, unusable, or, suffers, from, reduced, yields, sustainable, agriculture, depends, on, replenishing, the, soil, while, minimizing, the, use, or, need, of, non, renewable, resources, such, as, natural, gas, or, mineral, ores, a, farm, that, can, produce, perpetually, yet, has, negative, effects, on, environmental, quality, elsewhere, is, not, sustainable, agriculture, an, example, of, a, case, in, which, a, global, view, may, be, warranted, is, the, application, of, fertilizer, or, manure, which, can, improve, the, productivity, of, a, farm, but, can, pollute, nearby, rivers, and, coastal, waters, eutrophication, the, other, extreme, can, also, be, undesirable, as, the, problem, of, low, crop, yields, due, to, exhaustion, of, nutrients, in, the, soil, has, been, related, to, rainforest, destruction, in, asia, the, specific, amount, of, land, needed, for, sustainable, farming, is, about, 12, 5, acres, which, include, land, for, animal, fodder, cereal, production, as, a, cash, crop, and, other, food, crops, in, some, cases, a, small, unit, of, aquaculture, is, included, aari, 1996, nitrates, are, used, widely, in, farming, as, fertilizer, unfortunately, a, major, environmental, problem, associated, with, agriculture, is, the, leaching, of, nitrates, into, the, environment, possible, sources, of, nitrates, that, would, in, principle, be, available, indefinitely, include, the, last, option, was, proposed, in, the, 1970s, but, is, only, gradually, becoming, feasible, sustainable, options, for, replacing, other, nutrient, inputs, such, as, phosphorus, and, potassium, are, more, limited, other, options, include, long, term, crop, rotations, returning, to, natural, cycles, that, annually, flood, cultivated, lands, returning, lost, nutrients, such, as, the, flooding, of, the, nile, the, long, term, use, of, biochar, and, use, of, crop, and, livestock, landraces, that, are, adapted, to, less, than, ideal, conditions, such, as, pests, drought, or, lack, of, nutrients, crops, that, require, high, levels, of, soil, nutrients, can, be, cultivated, in, a, more, sustainable, manner, with, appropriate, fertilizer, management, practices, phosphate, is, a, primary, component, in, fertilizer, it, is, the, second, most, important, nutrient, for, plants, after, nitrogen, and, is, often, a, limiting, factor, it, is, important, for, sustainable, agriculture, as, it, can, improve, soil, fertility, and, crop, yields, phosphorus, is, involved, in, all, major, metabolic, processes, including, photosynthesis, energy, transfer, signal, transduction, macromolecular, biosynthesis, and, respiration, it, is, needed, for, root, ramification, and, strength, and, seed, formation, and, can, increase, disease, resistance, phosphorus, is, found, in, the, soil, in, both, inorganic, and, organic, forms, and, makes, up, approximately, 0, 05, of, soil, biomass, phosphorus, fertilizers, are, the, main, input, of, inorganic, phosphorus, in, agricultural, soils, and, approximately, 70, 80, of, phosphorus, in, cultivated, soils, is, inorganic, long, term, use, of, phosphate, containing, chemical, fertilizers, causes, eutrophication, and, deplete, soil, microbial, life, so, people, have, looked, to, other, sources, phosphorus, fertilizers, are, manufactured, from, rock, phosphate, however, rock, phosphate, is, a, non, renewable, resource, and, it, is, being, depleted, by, mining, for, agricultural, use, peak, phosphorus, will, occur, within, the, next, few, hundred, years, or, perhaps, earlier, potassium, is, a, macronutrient, very, important, for, plant, development, and, is, commonly, sought, in, fertilizers, this, nutrient, is, essential, for, agriculture, because, it, improves, water, retention, nutrient, value, yield, taste, color, texture, and, disease, resistance, of, crops, it, is, often, used, in, the, cultivation, of, grains, fruits, vegetables, rice, wheat, millets, sugar, corn, soybeans, palm, oil, and, coffee, potassium, chloride, kcl, represents, the, most, widely, source, of, k, used, in, agriculture, accounting, for, 90, of, all, potassium, produced, for, agricultural, use, the, use, of, kcl, leads, to, high, concentrations, of, chloride, cl, in, soil, harming, its, health, due, to, the, increase, in, soil, salinity, imbalance, in, nutrient, availability, and, this, ion, s, biocidal, effect, for, soil, organisms, in, consequences, the, development, of, plants, and, soil, organisms, is, affected, putting, at, risk, soil, biodiversity, and, agricultural, productivity, a, sustainable, option, for, replacing, kcl, are, chloride, free, fertilizers, its, use, should, take, into, account, plants, nutrition, needs, and, the, promotion, of, soil, health, land, degradation, is, becoming, a, severe, global, problem, according, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, about, a, quarter, of, the, earth, s, ice, free, land, area, is, subject, to, human, induced, degradation, medium, confidence, soil, erosion, from, agricultural, fields, is, estimated, to, be, currently, 10, to, 20, times, no, tillage, to, more, than, 100, times, conventional, tillage, higher, than, the, soil, formation, rate, medium, confidence, almost, half, of, the, land, on, earth, is, covered, with, dry, land, which, is, susceptible, to, degradation, over, a, billion, tonnes, of, southern, africa, s, soil, are, being, lost, to, erosion, annually, which, if, continued, will, result, in, halving, of, crop, yields, within, thirty, to, fifty, years, improper, soil, management, is, threatening, the, ability, to, grow, sufficient, food, intensive, agriculture, reduces, the, carbon, level, in, soil, impairing, soil, structure, crop, growth, and, ecosystem, functioning, and, accelerating, climate, change, modification, of, agricultural, practices, is, a, recognized, method, of, carbon, sequestration, as, soil, can, act, as, an, effective, carbon, sink, soil, management, techniques, include, no, till, farming, keyline, design, and, windbreaks, to, reduce, wind, erosion, reincorporation, of, organic, matter, into, the, soil, reducing, soil, salinization, and, preventing, water, run, off, as, the, global, population, increases, and, demand, for, food, increases, there, is, pressure, on, land, as, a, resource, in, land, use, planning, and, management, considering, the, impacts, of, land, use, changes, on, factors, such, as, soil, erosion, can, support, long, term, agricultural, sustainability, as, shown, by, a, study, of, wadi, ziqlab, a, dry, area, in, the, middle, east, where, farmers, graze, livestock, and, grow, olives, vegetables, and, grains, looking, back, over, the, 20th, century, shows, that, for, people, in, poverty, following, environmentally, sound, land, practices, has, not, always, been, a, viable, option, due, to, many, complex, and, challenging, life, circumstances, currently, increased, land, degradation, in, developing, countries, may, be, connected, with, rural, poverty, among, smallholder, farmers, when, forced, into, unsustainable, agricultural, practices, out, of, necessity, converting, big, parts, of, the, land, surface, to, agriculture, has, severe, environmental, and, health, consequences, for, example, it, leads, to, rise, in, zoonotic, disease, like, the, coronavirus, disease, 2019, due, to, the, degradation, of, natural, buffers, between, humans, and, animals, reducing, biodiversity, and, creating, larger, groups, of, genetically, similar, animals, land, is, a, finite, resource, on, earth, although, expansion, of, agricultural, land, can, decrease, biodiversity, and, contribute, to, deforestation, the, picture, is, complex, for, instance, a, study, examining, the, introduction, of, sheep, by, norse, settlers, vikings, to, the, faroe, islands, of, the, north, atlantic, concluded, that, over, time, the, fine, partitioning, of, land, plots, contributed, more, to, soil, erosion, and, degradation, than, grazing, itself, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, estimates, that, in, coming, decades, cropland, will, continue, to, be, lost, to, industrial, and, urban, development, along, with, reclamation, of, wetlands, and, conversion, of, forest, to, cultivation, resulting, in, the, loss, of, biodiversity, and, increased, soil, erosion, in, modern, agriculture, energy, is, used, in, on, farm, mechanisation, food, processing, storage, and, transportation, processes, it, has, therefore, been, found, that, energy, prices, are, closely, linked, to, food, prices, oil, is, also, used, as, an, input, in, agricultural, chemicals, the, international, energy, agency, projects, higher, prices, of, non, renewable, energy, resources, as, a, result, of, fossil, fuel, resources, being, depleted, it, may, therefore, decrease, global, food, security, unless, action, is, taken, to, decouple, fossil, fuel, energy, from, food, production, with, a, move, towards, energy, smart, agricultural, systems, including, renewable, energy, the, use, of, solar, powered, irrigation, in, pakistan, is, said, to, be, a, closed, system, for, agricultural, water, irrigation, the, environmental, cost, of, transportation, could, be, avoided, if, people, use, local, products, in, some, areas, sufficient, rainfall, is, available, for, crop, growth, but, many, other, areas, require, irrigation, for, irrigation, systems, to, be, sustainable, they, require, proper, management, to, avoid, salinization, and, must, not, use, more, water, from, their, source, than, is, naturally, replenishable, otherwise, the, water, source, effectively, becomes, a, non, renewable, resource, improvements, in, water, well, drilling, technology, and, submersible, pumps, combined, with, the, development, of, drip, irrigation, and, low, pressure, pivots, have, made, it, possible, to, regularly, achieve, high, crop, yields, in, areas, where, reliance, on, rainfall, alone, had, previously, made, successful, agriculture, unpredictable, however, this, progress, has, come, at, a, price, in, many, areas, such, as, the, ogallala, aquifer, the, water, is, being, used, faster, than, it, can, be, replenished, according, to, the, uc, davis, agricultural, sustainability, institute, several, steps, must, be, taken, to, develop, drought, resistant, farming, systems, even, in, normal, years, with, average, rainfall, these, measures, include, both, policy, and, management, actions, indicators, for, sustainable, water, resource, development, include, the, average, annual, flow, of, rivers, from, rainfall, flows, from, outside, a, country, the, percentage, of, water, coming, from, outside, a, country, and, gross, water, withdrawal, it, is, estimated, that, agricultural, practices, consume, 69, of, the, world, s, fresh, water, sustainable, agriculture, attempts, to, solve, multiple, problems, with, one, broad, solution, the, goal, of, sustainable, agricultural, practices, is, to, decrease, environmental, degradation, due, to, farming, while, increasing, crop, and, thus, food, output, there, are, many, varying, strategies, attempting, to, use, sustainable, farming, practices, in, order, to, increase, rural, economic, development, within, small, scale, farming, communities, two, of, the, most, popular, and, opposing, strategies, within, the, modern, discourse, are, allowing, unrestricted, markets, to, determine, food, production, and, deeming, food, a, human, right, neither, of, these, approaches, have, been, proven, to, work, without, fail, a, promising, proposal, to, rural, poverty, reduction, within, agricultural, communities, is, sustainable, economic, growth, the, most, important, aspect, of, this, policy, is, to, regularly, include, the, poorest, farmers, in, the, economy, wide, development, through, the, stabilization, of, small, scale, agricultural, economies, in, 2007, the, united, nations, reported, on, organic, agriculture, and, food, security, in, africa, stating, that, using, sustainable, agriculture, could, be, a, tool, in, reaching, global, food, security, without, expanding, land, usage, and, reducing, environmental, impacts, there, has, been, evidence, provided, by, developing, nations, from, the, early, 2000s, stating, that, when, people, in, their, communities, are, not, factored, into, the, agricultural, process, that, serious, harm, is, done, the, social, scientist, charles, kellogg, has, stated, that, in, a, final, effort, exploited, people, pass, their, suffering, to, the, land, sustainable, agriculture, mean, the, ability, to, permanently, and, continuously, feed, its, constituent, populations, there, are, a, lot, of, opportunities, that, can, increase, farmers, profits, improve, communities, and, continue, sustainable, practices, for, example, in, uganda, genetically, modified, organisms, were, originally, illegal, however, with, the, stress, of, banana, crisis, in, uganda, where, banana, bacterial, wilt, had, the, potential, to, wipe, out, 90, of, yield, they, decided, to, explore, gmos, as, a, possible, solution, the, government, issued, the, national, biotechnology, and, biosafety, bill, which, will, allow, scientists, that, are, part, of, the, national, banana, research, program, to, start, experimenting, with, genetically, modified, organisms, this, effort, has, the, potential, to, help, local, communities, because, a, significant, portion, live, off, the, food, they, grow, themselves, and, it, will, be, profitable, because, the, yield, of, their, main, produce, will, remain, stable, not, all, regions, are, suitable, for, agriculture, the, technological, advancement, of, the, past, few, decades, has, allowed, agriculture, to, develop, in, some, of, these, regions, for, example, nepal, has, built, greenhouses, to, deal, with, its, high, altitude, and, mountainous, regions, greenhouses, allow, for, greater, crop, production, and, also, use, less, water, since, they, are, closed, systems, desalination, techniques, can, turn, salt, water, into, fresh, water, which, allows, greater, access, to, water, for, areas, with, a, limited, supply, this, allows, the, irrigation, of, crops, without, decreasing, natural, fresh, water, sources, while, desalination, can, be, a, tool, to, provide, water, to, areas, that, need, it, to, sustain, agriculture, it, requires, money, and, resources, regions, of, china, have, been, considering, large, scale, desalination, in, order, to, increase, access, to, water, but, the, current, cost, of, the, desalination, process, makes, it, impractical, women, working, in, sustainable, agriculture, come, from, numerous, backgrounds, ranging, from, academia, to, labour, from, 1978, 2007, in, the, united, states, the, number, of, women, farm, operators, has, tripled, in, 2007, women, operated, 14, percent, of, farms, compared, to, five, percent, in, 1978, much, of, the, growth, is, due, to, women, farming, outside, of, the, male, dominated, field, of, conventional, agriculture, the, practice, of, growing, food, in, the, backyard, of, houses, schools, etc, by, families, or, by, communities, became, widespread, in, the, us, at, the, time, of, world, war, i, the, great, depression, and, world, war, ii, so, that, in, one, point, of, time, 40, of, the, vegetables, of, the, usa, was, produced, in, this, way, the, practice, became, more, popular, again, in, the, time, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, this, method, permits, to, grow, food, in, a, relatively, sustainable, way, and, at, the, same, time, can, make, it, easier, for, poor, people, to, obtain, food, costs, such, as, environmental, problems, not, covered, in, traditional, accounting, systems, which, take, into, account, only, the, direct, costs, of, production, incurred, by, the, farmer, are, known, as, externalities, netting, studied, sustainability, and, intensive, agriculture, in, smallholder, systems, through, history, there, are, several, studies, incorporating, externalities, such, as, ecosystem, services, biodiversity, land, degradation, and, sustainable, land, management, in, economic, analysis, these, include, the, economics, of, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, study, and, the, economics, of, land, degradation, initiative, which, seek, to, establish, an, economic, cost, benefit, analysis, on, the, practice, of, sustainable, land, management, and, sustainable, agriculture, triple, bottom, line, frameworks, include, social, and, environmental, alongside, a, financial, bottom, line, a, sustainable, future, can, be, feasible, if, growth, in, material, consumption, and, population, is, slowed, down, and, if, there, is, a, drastic, increase, in, the, efficiency, of, material, and, energy, use, to, make, that, transition, long, and, short, term, goals, will, need, to, be, balanced, enhancing, equity, and, quality, of, life, the, barriers, to, sustainable, agriculture, can, be, broken, down, and, understood, through, three, different, dimensions, these, three, dimensions, are, seen, as, the, core, pillars, to, sustainability, social, environmental, and, economic, pillars, the, social, pillar, addresses, issues, related, to, the, conditions, in, which, societies, are, born, into, growing, in, and, learning, from, it, deals, with, shifting, away, from, traditional, practices, of, agricultural, and, moving, into, new, sustainable, practices, that, will, create, better, societies, and, conditions, the, environmental, pillar, addresses, climate, change, and, focuses, on, agricultural, practices, that, protect, the, environment, for, future, generations, the, economic, pillar, discovers, ways, in, which, sustainable, agriculture, can, be, practiced, while, fostering, economic, growth, and, stability, with, minimal, disruptions, to, livelihoods, all, three, pillars, must, be, addressed, to, determine, and, overcome, the, barriers, preventing, sustainable, agricultural, practices, social, barriers, to, sustainable, agriculture, include, cultural, shifts, the, need, for, collaboration, incentives, and, new, legislation, the, move, from, conventional, to, sustainable, agriculture, will, require, significant, behavioural, changes, from, both, farmers, and, consumers, cooperation, and, collaboration, between, farmers, is, necessary, to, successfully, transition, to, sustainable, practices, with, minimal, complications, this, can, be, seen, as, a, challenge, for, farmers, who, care, about, competition, and, profitability, there, must, also, be, an, incentive, for, farmers, to, change, their, methods, of, agriculture, the, use, of, public, policy, advertisements, and, laws, that, make, sustainable, agriculture, mandatory, or, desirable, can, be, utilized, to, overcome, these, social, barriers, environmental, barriers, prevent, the, ability, to, protect, and, conserve, the, natural, ecosystem, examples, of, these, barriers, include, the, use, of, pesticides, and, the, effects, of, climate, change, pesticides, are, widely, used, to, combat, pests, that, can, devastate, production, and, plays, a, significant, role, in, keeping, food, prices, and, production, costs, low, to, move, toward, sustainable, agriculture, farmers, are, encouraged, to, utilize, green, pesticides, which, cause, less, harm, to, both, human, health, and, habitats, but, would, entail, a, higher, production, cost, climate, change, is, also, a, rapidly, growing, barrier, one, that, farmers, have, little, control, over, which, can, be, seen, through, place, based, barriers, these, place, based, barriers, include, factors, such, as, weather, conditions, topography, and, soil, quality, which, can, cause, losses, in, production, resulting, in, the, reluctance, to, switch, from, conventional, practices, many, environmental, benefits, are, also, not, visible, or, immediately, evident, significant, changes, such, as, lower, rates, of, soil, and, nutrient, loss, improved, soil, structure, and, higher, levels, of, beneficial, microorganisms, take, time, in, conventional, agriculture, the, benefits, are, easily, visible, with, no, weeds, pests, etc, but, the, long, term, costs, to, the, soil, and, surrounding, ecosystems, are, hidden, and, externalized, conventional, agricultural, practices, since, the, evolution, of, technology, have, caused, significant, damage, to, the, environment, through, biodiversity, loss, disrupted, ecosystems, poor, water, quality, among, other, harms, the, economic, obstacles, to, implementing, sustainable, agricultural, practices, include, low, financial, return, profitability, lack, of, financial, incentives, and, negligible, capital, investments, financial, incentives, and, circumstances, play, a, large, role, in, whether, sustainable, practices, will, be, adopted, the, human, and, material, capital, required, to, shift, to, sustainable, methods, of, agriculture, requires, training, of, the, workforce, and, making, investments, in, new, technology, and, products, which, comes, at, a, high, cost, in, addition, to, this, farmers, practicing, conventional, agriculture, can, mass, produce, their, crops, and, therefore, maximize, their, profitability, this, would, be, difficult, to, do, in, sustainable, agriculture, which, encourages, low, production, capacity, the, author, james, howard, kunstler, claims, almost, all, modern, technology, is, bad, and, that, there, cannot, be, sustainability, unless, agriculture, is, done, in, ancient, traditional, ways, efforts, toward, more, sustainable, agriculture, are, supported, in, the, sustainability, community, however, these, are, often, viewed, only, as, incremental, steps, and, not, as, an, end, one, promising, method, of, encouraging, sustainable, agriculture, is, through, local, farming, and, community, gardens, incorporating, local, produce, and, agricultural, education, into, schools, communities, and, institutions, can, promote, the, consumption, of, freshly, grown, produce, which, will, drive, consumer, demand, some, foresee, a, true, sustainable, steady, state, economy, that, may, be, very, different, from, today, s, greatly, reduced, energy, usage, minimal, ecological, footprint, fewer, consumer, packaged, goods, local, purchasing, with, short, food, supply, chains, little, processed, foods, more, home, and, community, gardens, etc, there, is, a, debate, on, the, definition, of, sustainability, regarding, agriculture, the, definition, could, be, characterized, by, two, different, approaches, an, ecocentric, approach, and, a, technocentric, approach, the, ecocentric, approach, emphasizes, no, or, low, growth, levels, of, human, development, and, focuses, on, organic, and, biodynamic, farming, techniques, with, the, goal, of, changing, consumption, patterns, and, resource, allocation, and, usage, the, technocentric, approach, argues, that, sustainability, can, be, attained, through, a, variety, of, strategies, from, the, view, that, state, led, modification, of, the, industrial, system, like, conservation, oriented, farming, systems, should, be, implemented, to, the, argument, that, biotechnology, is, the, best, way, to, meet, the, increasing, demand, for, food, one, can, look, at, the, topic, of, sustainable, agriculture, through, two, different, lenses, multifunctional, agriculture, and, ecosystem, services, both, of, approaches, are, similar, but, look, at, the, function, of, agriculture, differently, those, that, employ, the, multifunctional, agriculture, philosophy, focus, on, farm, centered, approaches, and, define, function, as, being, the, outputs, of, agricultural, activity, the, central, argument, of, multifunctionality, is, that, agriculture, is, a, multifunctional, enterprise, with, other, functions, aside, from, the, production, of, food, and, fiber, these, functions, include, renewable, resource, management, landscape, conservation, and, biodiversity, the, ecosystem, service, centered, approach, posits, that, individuals, and, society, as, a, whole, receive, benefits, from, ecosystems, which, are, called, ecosystem, services, in, sustainable, agriculture, the, services, that, ecosystems, provide, include, pollination, soil, formation, and, nutrient, cycling, all, of, which, are, necessary, functions, for, the, production, of, food, it, is, also, claimed, sustainable, agriculture, is, best, considered, as, an, ecosystem, approach, to, agriculture, called, agroecology, most, agricultural, professionals, agree, that, there, is, a, moral, obligation, to, pursue, goal, sustainability, the, major, debate, comes, from, what, system, will, provide, a, path, to, that, goal, because, if, an, unsustainable, method, is, used, on, a, large, scale, it, will, have, a, massive, negative, effect, on, the, environment, and, human, population, other, practices, include, polyculture, growing, a, diverse, number, of, perennial, crops, in, a, single, field, each, of, which, would, grow, in, separate, seasons, so, as, not, to, compete, with, each, other, for, natural, resources, this, system, would, result, in, increased, resistance, to, diseases, and, decreased, effects, of, erosion, and, loss, of, nutrients, in, the, soil, nitrogen, fixation, from, legumes, for, example, used, in, conjunction, with, plants, that, rely, on, nitrate, from, the, soil, for, growth, helps, to, allow, the, land, to, be, reused, annually, legumes, will, grow, for, a, season, and, replenish, the, soil, with, ammonium, and, nitrate, and, the, next, season, other, plants, can, be, seeded, and, grown, in, the, field, in, preparation, for, harvest, sustainable, methods, of, weed, management, may, help, reduce, the, development, of, herbicide, resistant, weeds, crop, rotation, may, also, replenish, nitrogen, if, legumes, are, used, in, the, rotations, and, may, also, use, resources, more, efficiently, there, are, also, many, ways, to, practice, sustainable, animal, husbandry, some, of, the, tools, to, grazing, management, include, fencing, off, the, grazing, area, into, smaller, areas, called, paddocks, lowering, stock, density, and, moving, the, stock, between, paddocks, frequently, an, increased, production, is, a, goal, of, intensification, sustainable, intensification, encompasses, specific, agriculture, methods, that, increase, production, and, at, the, same, time, help, improve, environmental, outcomes, the, desired, outcomes, of, the, farm, are, achieved, without, the, need, for, more, land, cultivation, or, destruction, of, natural, habitat, the, system, performance, is, upgraded, with, no, net, environmental, cost, sustainable, intensification, has, become, a, priority, for, the, united, nations, sustainable, intensification, differs, from, prior, intensification, methods, by, specifically, placing, importance, on, broader, environmental, outcomes, by, 2018, it, was, predicted, in, 100, nations, a, combined, total, of, 163, million, farms, used, sustainable, intensification, the, amount, of, agricultural, land, covered, by, this, is, 453, million, ha, of, land, that, amount, of, land, is, equal, to, 29, of, farms, worldwide, in, light, of, concerns, about, food, security, human, population, growth, and, dwindling, land, suitable, for, agriculture, sustainable, intensive, farming, practises, are, needed, to, maintain, high, crop, yields, while, maintaining, soil, health, and, ecosystem, services, the, capacity, for, ecosystem, services, to, be, strong, enough, to, allow, a, reduction, in, use, of, non, renewable, inputs, whilst, maintaining, or, boosting, yields, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, recent, work, in, irrigated, rice, production, system, of, east, asia, has, suggested, that, in, relation, to, pest, management, at, least, promoting, the, ecosystem, service, of, biological, control, using, nectar, plants, can, reduce, the, need, for, insecticides, by, 70, whilst, delivering, a, 5, yield, advantage, compared, with, standard, practice, vertical, farming, is, a, concept, with, the, potential, advantages, of, year, round, production, isolation, from, pests, and, diseases, controllable, resource, recycling, and, reduced, transportation, costs, water, efficiency, can, be, improved, by, reducing, the, need, for, irrigation, and, using, alternative, methods, such, methods, include, researching, on, drought, resistant, crops, monitoring, plant, transpiration, and, reducing, soil, evaporation, drought, resistant, crops, have, been, researched, extensively, as, a, means, to, overcome, the, issue, of, water, shortage, they, are, modified, genetically, so, they, can, adapt, in, an, environment, with, little, water, this, is, beneficial, as, it, reduces, the, need, for, irrigation, and, helps, conserve, water, although, they, have, been, extensively, researched, significant, results, have, not, been, achieved, as, most, of, the, successful, species, will, have, no, overall, impact, on, water, conservation, however, some, grains, like, rice, for, example, have, been, successfully, genetically, modified, to, be, drought, resistant, soil, amendments, include, using, compost, from, recycling, centers, using, compost, from, yard, and, kitchen, waste, uses, available, resources, in, the, area, abstinence, from, soil, tillage, before, planting, and, leaving, the, plant, residue, after, harvesting, reduces, soil, water, evaporation, it, also, serves, to, prevent, soil, erosion, crop, residues, left, covering, the, surface, of, the, soil, may, result, in, reduced, evaporation, of, water, a, lower, surface, soil, temperature, and, reduction, of, wind, effects, a, way, to, make, rock, phosphate, more, effective, is, to, add, microbial, inoculates, such, as, phosphate, solubilizing, microorganisms, known, as, psms, to, the, soil, these, solubilize, phosphorus, already, in, the, soil, and, use, processes, like, organic, acid, production, and, ion, exchange, reactions, to, make, that, phosphorus, available, for, plants, experimentally, these, psms, have, been, shown, to, increase, crop, growth, in, terms, of, shoot, height, dry, biomass, and, grain, yield, phosphorus, uptake, is, even, more, efficient, with, the, presence, of, mycorrhizae, in, the, soil, mycorrhiza, is, a, type, of, mutualistic, symbiotic, association, between, plants, and, fungi, which, are, well, equipped, to, absorb, nutrients, including, phosphorus, in, soil, these, fungi, can, increase, nutrient, uptake, in, soil, where, phosphorus, has, been, fixed, by, aluminum, calcium, and, iron, mycorrhizae, can, also, release, organic, acids, that, solubilize, otherwise, unavailable, phosphorus, soil, steaming, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, chemicals, for, soil, sterilization, different, methods, are, available, to, induce, steam, into, the, soil, to, kill, pests, and, increase, soil, health, solarizing, is, based, on, the, same, principle, used, to, increase, the, temperature, of, the, soil, to, kill, pathogens, and, pests, certain, plants, can, be, cropped, for, use, as, biofumigants, natural, fumigants, releasing, pest, suppressing, compounds, when, crushed, ploughed, into, the, soil, and, covered, in, plastic, for, four, weeks, plants, in, the, brassicaceae, family, release, large, amounts, of, toxic, compounds, such, as, methyl, isothiocyanates, relocating, current, croplands, to, environmentally, more, optimal, locations, whilst, allowing, ecosystems, in, then, abandoned, areas, to, regenerate, could, substantially, decrease, the, current, carbon, biodiversity, and, irrigation, water, footprint, of, global, crop, production, with, relocation, only, within, national, borders, also, having, substantial, potential, sustainability, may, also, involve, crop, rotation, crop, rotation, and, cover, crops, prevent, soil, erosion, by, protecting, topsoil, from, wind, and, water, effective, crop, rotation, can, reduce, pest, pressure, on, crops, provides, weed, control, reduces, disease, build, up, and, improves, the, efficiency, of, soil, nutrients, and, nutrient, cycling, this, reduces, the, need, for, fertilizers, and, pesticides, increasing, the, diversity, of, crops, by, introducing, new, genetic, resources, can, increase, yields, by, 10, to, 15, percent, compared, to, when, they, are, grown, in, monoculture, perennial, crops, reduce, the, need, for, tillage, and, thus, help, mitigate, soil, erosion, and, may, sometimes, tolerate, drought, better, increase, water, quality, and, help, increase, soil, organic, matter, there, are, research, programs, attempting, to, develop, perennial, substitutes, for, existing, annual, crops, such, as, replacing, wheat, with, the, wild, grass, thinopyrum, intermedium, or, possible, experimental, hybrids, of, it, and, wheat, being, able, to, do, all, of, this, without, the, use, of, chemicals, is, one, of, the, main, goals, of, sustainability, which, is, why, crop, rotation, is, a, very, central, method, of, sustainable, agriculture, organic, agriculture, can, be, defined, as, an, integrated, farming, system, that, strives, for, sustainability, the, enhancement, of, soil, fertility, and, biological, diversity, whilst, with, rare, exceptions, prohibiting, synthetic, pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic, fertilizers, genetically, modified, organisms, and, growth, hormones, some, claim, organic, agriculture, may, produce, the, most, sustainable, products, available, for, consumers, in, the, us, where, no, other, alternatives, exist, although, the, focus, of, the, organics, industry, is, not, sustainability, in, 2018, the, sales, of, organic, products, in, usa, reach, 52, 5, billion, according, to, a, usda, survey, two, thirds, of, americans, consume, organic, products, at, least, occasionally, ecological, farming, is, a, concept, that, focused, on, the, environmental, aspects, of, sustainable, agriculture, ecological, farming, includes, all, methods, including, organic, which, regenerate, ecosystem, services, like, prevention, of, soil, erosion, water, infiltration, and, retention, carbon, sequestration, in, the, form, of, humus, and, increased, biodiversity, many, techniques, are, used, including, no, till, farming, multispecies, cover, crops, strip, cropping, terrace, cultivation, shelter, belts, pasture, cropping, etc, there, are, a, plethora, of, methods, and, techniques, that, are, employed, when, practicing, ecological, farming, all, having, their, own, unique, benefits, and, implementations, that, lead, to, more, sustainable, agriculture, crop, genetic, diversity, is, one, method, that, is, used, to, reduce, the, risks, associated, with, monoculture, crops, which, can, be, susceptible, to, a, changing, climate, this, form, of, biodiversity, causes, crops, to, be, more, resilient, increasing, food, security, and, enhancing, the, productivity, of, the, field, on, a, long, term, scale, the, use, of, biodigestors, is, another, method, which, converts, organic, waste, into, a, combustible, gas, which, can, provide, several, benefits, to, an, ecological, farm, it, can, be, used, as, a, fuel, source, fertilizer, for, crops, and, fish, ponds, and, serves, as, a, method, for, removing, wastes, that, are, rich, in, organic, matter, because, biodigestors, can, be, used, as, fertilizer, it, reduces, the, amount, of, industrial, fertilizers, that, are, needed, to, sustain, the, yields, of, the, farm, another, technique, used, is, aquaculture, integration, which, combines, fish, farming, with, agricultural, farming, using, the, wastes, from, animals, and, crops, and, diverting, them, towards, the, fish, farms, to, be, used, up, instead, of, being, leeched, into, the, environment, mud, from, the, fish, ponds, can, also, be, used, to, fertilize, crops, organic, fertilizers, can, also, be, employed, in, an, ecological, farm, such, as, animal, and, green, manure, this, allows, soil, fertility, to, be, improved, and, well, maintained, leads, to, reduced, costs, and, increased, yields, reduces, the, usage, of, non, renewable, resources, in, industrial, fertilizers, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, and, reduces, the, environmental, pressures, that, are, posed, by, intensive, agricultural, systems, precision, agriculture, can, also, be, used, which, focuses, on, efficient, removal, of, pests, using, non, chemical, techniques, and, minimizes, the, amount, of, tilling, needed, to, sustain, the, farm, an, example, of, a, precision, machine, is, the, false, seedbed, tiller, which, can, remove, a, great, majority, of, small, weeds, while, only, tilling, one, centimeter, deep, this, minimized, tilling, reduces, the, amount, of, new, weeds, that, germinate, from, soil, disturbance, other, methods, that, reduce, soil, erosion, include, contour, farming, strip, cropping, and, terrace, cultivation, the, challenge, for, ecological, farming, science, is, to, be, able, to, achieve, a, mainstream, productive, food, system, that, is, sustainable, or, even, regenerative, to, enter, the, field, of, ecological, farming, location, relative, to, the, consumer, can, reduce, the, food, miles, factor, to, help, minimise, damage, to, the, biosphere, by, combustion, engine, emissions, involved, in, current, food, transportation, design, of, the, ecological, farm, is, initially, constrained, by, the, same, limitations, as, conventional, farming, local, climate, the, soil, s, physical, properties, budget, for, beneficial, soil, supplements, manpower, and, available, automatons, however, long, term, water, management, by, ecological, farming, methods, is, likely, to, conserve, and, increase, water, availability, for, the, location, and, require, far, fewer, inputs, to, maintain, fertility, certain, principles, unique, to, ecological, farming, need, to, be, considered, often, thought, of, as, inherently, destructive, slash, and, burn, or, slash, and, char, shifting, cultivation, have, been, practiced, in, the, amazon, for, thousands, of, years, some, traditional, systems, combine, polyculture, with, sustainability, in, south, east, asia, rice, fish, systems, on, rice, paddies, have, raised, freshwater, fish, as, well, as, rice, producing, an, additional, product, and, reducing, eutrophication, of, neighboring, rivers, a, variant, in, indonesia, combines, rice, fish, ducks, and, water, fern, the, ducks, eat, the, weeds, that, would, otherwise, limit, rice, growth, saving, labour, and, herbicides, while, the, duck, and, fish, manure, substitute, for, fertilizer, raised, field, agriculture, has, been, recently, revived, in, certain, areas, of, the, world, such, as, the, altiplano, region, in, bolivia, and, peru, this, has, resurged, in, the, form, of, traditional, waru, waru, raised, fields, which, create, nutrient, rich, soil, in, regions, where, such, soil, is, scarce, this, method, is, extremely, productive, and, has, recently, been, utilized, by, indigenous, groups, in, the, area, and, the, nearby, amazon, basin, to, make, use, of, lands, that, have, been, historically, hard, to, cultivate, other, forms, of, traditional, agriculture, include, agro, forestry, crop, rotations, and, water, harvesting, water, harvesting, is, one, of, the, largest, and, most, common, practices, particularly, used, in, dry, areas, and, seasons, in, ethiopia, over, half, of, their, gdp, and, over, 80, percent, of, their, exports, are, attributed, to, agriculture, yet, it, is, known, for, its, intense, droughts, and, dry, periods, rain, water, harvesting, is, considered, to, be, a, low, cost, alternative, this, type, of, harvesting, collects, and, stores, water, from, roof, tops, during, high, rain, periods, for, use, during, droughts, rainwater, harvesting, has, been, a, large, practice, to, help, the, country, survive, by, focusing, on, runoff, irrigation, roof, water, harvesting, and, flood, spreading, native, americans, in, the, united, states, practiced, sustainable, agriculture, through, their, subsistence, farming, techniques, many, tribes, grew, or, harvested, their, own, food, from, plants, that, thrived, in, their, local, ecosystems, native, american, farming, practices, are, specific, to, local, environments, and, work, with, natural, processes, this, is, a, practice, called, permaculture, and, it, involves, a, deep, understanding, of, the, local, environment, native, american, farming, techniques, also, incorporate, local, biodiversity, into, many, of, their, practices, which, helps, the, land, remain, healthy, many, indigenous, tribes, incorporated, intercropping, into, their, agriculture, which, is, a, practice, where, multiple, crops, are, planted, together, in, the, same, area, this, strategy, allows, crops, to, help, one, another, grow, through, exchanged, nutrients, maintained, soil, moisture, and, physical, supports, for, one, another, the, crops, that, are, paired, in, intercropping, often, do, not, heavily, compete, for, resources, which, helps, them, to, each, be, successful, for, example, many, tribes, utilized, intercropping, in, ways, such, as, the, three, sisters, garden, this, gardening, technique, consists, of, corn, beans, and, squash, these, crops, grow, in, unity, as, the, corn, stalk, supports, the, beans, the, beans, produce, nitrogen, and, the, squash, retain, moisture, intercropping, also, provides, a, natural, strategy, for, pest, management, and, the, prevention, of, weed, growth, intercropping, is, a, natural, agricultural, practice, that, often, improves, the, overall, health, of, the, soil, and, plants, increases, crop, yield, and, is, sustainable, one, of, the, most, significant, aspects, of, indigenous, sustainable, agriculture, is, their, traditional, ecological, knowledge, of, harvesting, the, anishinaabe, tribes, follow, an, ideology, known, as, the, honorable, harvest, the, honorable, harvest, is, a, set, of, practices, that, emphasize, the, idea, that, people, should, take, only, what, you, need, and, use, everything, you, take, resources, are, conserved, through, this, practice, because, several, rules, are, followed, when, harvesting, a, plant, these, rules, are, to, never, take, the, first, plant, never, take, more, than, half, of, the, plants, and, never, take, the, last, plant, this, encourages, future, growth, of, the, plant, and, therefore, leads, to, a, sustainable, use, of, the, plants, in, the, area, native, americans, practiced, agroforestry, by, managing, the, forest, animals, and, crops, together, they, also, helped, promote, tree, growth, through, controlled, burns, and, silviculture, often, the, remaining, ash, from, these, burns, would, be, used, to, fertilize, their, crops, by, improving, the, conditions, of, the, forest, the, local, wildlife, populations, also, increased, native, americans, allowed, their, livestock, to, graze, in, the, forest, which, provided, natural, fertilizer, for, the, trees, as, well, regenerative, agriculture, is, a, conservation, and, rehabilitation, approach, to, food, and, farming, systems, it, focuses, on, topsoil, regeneration, increasing, biodiversity, improving, the, water, cycle, enhancing, ecosystem, services, supporting, biosequestration, increasing, resilience, to, climate, change, and, strengthening, the, health, and, vitality, of, farm, soil, practices, include, recycling, as, much, farm, waste, as, possible, and, adding, composted, material, from, sources, outside, the, farm, permaculture, is, an, approach, to, land, management, and, settlement, design, that, adopts, arrangements, observed, in, flourishing, natural, ecosystems, it, includes, a, set, of, design, principles, derived, using, whole, systems, thinking, it, applies, these, principles, in, fields, such, as, regenerative, agriculture, town, planning, rewilding, and, community, resilience, the, term, was, coined, in, 1978, by, bill, mollison, and, david, holmgren, who, formulated, the, concept, in, opposition, to, modern, industrialized, methods, instead, adopting, a, more, traditional, or, natural, approach, to, agriculture, there, is, limited, evidence, polyculture, may, contribute, to, sustainable, agriculture, a, meta, analysis, of, a, number, of, polycrop, studies, found, that, predator, insect, biodiversity, was, higher, at, comparable, yields, than, conventional, in, certain, two, crop, systems, with, a, single, cash, crop, combined, with, a, cover, crop, one, approach, to, sustainability, is, to, develop, polyculture, systems, using, perennial, crop, varieties, such, varieties, are, being, developed, for, rice, wheat, sorghum, barley, and, sunflowers, if, these, can, be, combined, in, polyculture, with, a, leguminous, cover, crop, such, as, alfalfa, fixation, of, nitrogen, will, be, added, to, the, system, reducing, the, need, for, fertilizer, and, pesticides, the, use, of, available, city, space, e, g, rooftop, gardens, community, gardens, garden, sharing, organop, nicos, and, other, forms, of, urban, agriculture, may, be, able, to, contribute, to, sustainability, some, consider, guerrilla, gardening, an, example, of, sustainability, in, action, in, some, cases, seeds, of, edible, plants, have, been, sown, in, local, rural, areas, hydroponics, is, an, alternative, to, agriculture, that, creates, the, ideal, environment, for, optimal, growth, without, using, a, dormant, medium, this, innovative, farming, technique, produces, higher, crop, yields, without, compromising, soil, health, the, most, significant, drawback, of, this, sustainable, farming, technique, is, the, cost, associated, with, development, certification, systems, are, important, to, the, agriculture, community, and, to, consumers, as, these, standards, determine, the, sustainability, of, produce, numerous, sustainability, standards, and, certification, systems, exist, including, organic, certification, rainforest, alliance, fair, trade, utz, certified, globalgap, bird, friendly, and, the, common, code, for, the, coffee, community, 4c, these, standards, specify, rules, that, producers, manufacturers, and, traders, need, to, follow, so, that, the, things, they, do, make, or, grow, do, not, hurt, people, and, the, environment, these, standards, are, also, known, as, voluntary, sustainability, standards, vss, that, are, private, standards, that, require, products, to, meet, specific, economic, social, or, environmental, sustainability, metrics, the, requirements, can, refer, to, product, quality, or, attributes, but, also, to, production, and, processing, methods, as, well, as, transportation, vss, are, mostly, designed, and, marketed, by, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, or, private, firms, and, they, are, adopted, by, actors, up, and, down, the, value, chain, from, farmers, to, retailers, certifications, and, labels, are, used, to, signal, the, successful, implementation, of, a, vss, according, to, the, itc, standards, map, the, mostly, covered, products, by, standards, are, agricultural, products, around, 500, vss, today, apply, to, key, exports, of, many, developing, countries, such, as, coffee, tea, bananas, cocoa, palm, oil, timber, cotton, and, organic, agri, foods, vss, are, found, to, reduce, eutrophication, water, use, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, natural, ecosystem, conversion, and, thus, are, considered, as, a, potential, tool, for, sustainable, agriculture, the, usda, produces, an, organic, label, that, is, supported, by, nationalized, standards, of, farmers, and, facilities, the, steps, for, certification, consist, of, creating, an, organic, system, plan, which, determines, how, produce, will, be, tilled, grazed, harvested, stored, and, transported, this, plan, also, manages, and, monitors, the, substances, used, around, the, produce, the, maintenance, needed, to, protect, the, produce, and, any, nonorganic, products, that, may, come, in, contact, with, the, produce, the, organic, system, plan, is, then, reviewed, and, inspected, by, the, usda, certifying, agent, once, the, certification, is, granted, the, produce, receives, an, approval, sticker, from, the, usda, and, the, produce, is, distributed, across, the, u, s, in, order, to, hold, farmers, accountable, and, ensure, that, americans, are, receiving, organic, produce, these, inspections, are, done, at, least, once, a, year, this, is, just, one, example, of, sustainable, certification, systems, through, produce, maintenance, sustainable, agriculture, is, a, topic, in, international, policy, concerning, its, potential, to, reduce, environmental, risks, in, 2011, the, commission, on, sustainable, agriculture, and, climate, change, as, part, of, its, recommendations, for, policymakers, on, achieving, food, security, in, the, face, of, climate, change, urged, that, sustainable, agriculture, must, be, integrated, into, national, and, international, policy, the, commission, stressed, that, increasing, weather, variability, and, climate, shocks, will, negatively, affect, agricultural, yields, necessitating, early, action, to, drive, change, in, agricultural, production, systems, towards, increasing, resilience, it, also, called, for, dramatically, increased, investments, in, sustainable, agriculture, in, the, next, decade, including, in, national, research, and, development, budgets, land, rehabilitation, economic, incentives, and, infrastructure, improvement, during, 2021, united, nations, climate, change, conference, 45, countries, pledged, to, give, more, than, 4, billion, dollars, for, transition, to, sustainable, agriculture, the, organization, slow, food, expressed, concern, about, the, effectivity, of, the, spendings, as, they, concentrate, on, technological, solutions, and, reforestation, en, place, of, a, holistic, agroecology, that, transforms, food, from, a, mass, produced, commodity, into, part, of, a, sustainable, system, that, works, within, natural, boundaries, additionally, the, summit, consisted, of, negotiations, that, led, to, heavily, reducing, co, 2, emissions, becoming, carbon, neutral, ending, deforestation, and, reliance, on, coal, and, limiting, methane, emissions, in, november, the, climate, action, tracker, reported, that, global, efforts, are, on, track, to, for, a, 2, 7, c, temperature, increase, with, current, policies, finding, that, the, current, targets, will, not, meet, global, needs, as, coal, and, natural, gas, consumption, are, primarily, responsible, for, the, gap, in, progress, since, like, minded, developing, countries, asked, for, an, addendum, to, the, agreement, that, removed, the, obligation, for, developing, countries, to, meet, the, same, requirements, of, wealthy, nations, in, may, 2020, the, european, union, published, a, program, named, from, farm, to, fork, for, making, its, agriculture, more, sustainable, in, the, official, page, of, the, program, from, farm, to, fork, is, cited, frans, timmermans, the, executive, vice, president, of, the, european, commission, saying, that, the, coronavirus, crisis, has, shown, how, vulnerable, we, all, are, and, how, important, it, is, to, restore, the, balance, between, human, activity, and, nature, at, the, heart, of, the, green, deal, the, biodiversity, and, farm, to, fork, strategies, point, to, a, new, and, better, balance, of, nature, food, systems, and, biodiversity, to, protect, our, people, s, health, and, well, being, and, at, the, same, time, to, increase, the, eu, s, competitiveness, and, resilience, these, strategies, are, a, crucial, part, of, the, great, transition, we, are, embarking, upon, the, program, includes, the, next, targets, policies, from, 1930, 2000, the, new, deal, implemented, policies, and, programs, that, promoted, sustainable, agriculture, under, the, agriculture, adjustment, act, of, 1933, it, provided, farmers, payments, to, create, a, supply, management, regime, that, capped, production, of, important, crops, this, allowed, farmers, to, focus, on, growing, food, and, not, competing, in, the, market, based, system, the, new, deal, also, provided, a, monetary, incentive, for, farmers, that, left, some, of, their, fields, unsown, or, ungrazed, to, order, to, improve, the, soil, conditions, the, cooperative, extension, service, was, also, established, that, set, up, sharing, funding, responsibilities, amongst, the, usda, land, grant, universities, and, local, communities, the, 1950s, to, 1990s, was, when, the, government, switched, its, stance, on, agriculture, policy, which, halted, sustainable, agriculture, the, agricultural, act, of, 1954, passed, which, supported, farmers, with, flexible, price, supports, but, only, to, commodity, programs, the, food, and, agricultural, act, of, 1965, had, new, income, support, payments, and, continued, supply, controls, but, reduced, priced, supports, agriculture, and, consumer, protection, act, of, 1973, removed, price, supports, and, instead, introduced, target, prices, and, deficiency, payments, it, continued, to, promote, commodity, crops, by, lowering, interest, rates, food, security, act, of, 1985, continued, commodity, loan, programs, these, policies, incentivized, profit, over, sustainability, because, the, us, government, was, promoting, farms, to, maximize, their, production, output, instead, of, placing, checks, this, meant, that, farms, were, being, turned, into, food, factories, as, they, became, bigger, in, size, and, grew, more, commodity, crops, like, corn, wheat, and, cotton, from, 1900, to, 2002, the, number, of, farms, in, the, us, decreased, significantly, while, the, average, size, of, a, farm, went, up, after, 1950, current, policies, in, the, united, states, the, federal, natural, resources, conservation, service, usda, provides, technical, and, financial, assistance, for, those, interested, in, pursuing, natural, resource, conservation, along, with, production, agriculture, with, programs, like, sare, and, china, uk, sain, to, help, promote, research, on, sustainable, agriculture, practices, and, a, framework, for, agriculture, and, climate, change, respectively, future, policies, currently, there, are, policies, on, the, table, that, could, move, the, us, agriculture, system, into, a, more, sustainable, direction, with, the, green, new, deal, this, policy, promotes, decentralizing, agrarian, governance, by, breaking, up, large, commodity, farms, that, were, created, in, the, 1950s, to, 1980s, decentralized, governance, within, the, farming, community, would, allow, for, more, adaptive, management, at, local, levels, to, help, focus, on, climate, change, mitigation, food, security, and, landscape, scale, ecological, stewardship, the, green, new, deal, would, invest, in, public, infrastructure, to, support, farmers, transition, from, industrial, food, regime, and, acquire, agroecological, skills, just, like, in, the, new, deal, it, would, invest, in, cooperatives, and, commons, to, share, and, redistribute, resources, like, land, food, equipment, research, facilities, personnel, and, training, programs, all, of, these, policies, and, programs, would, break, down, barriers, that, have, prevented, sustainable, farmers, and, agriculture, from, taking, place, in, the, united, states, in, 2016, the, chinese, government, adopted, a, plan, to, reduce, china, s, meat, consumption, by, 50, for, achieving, more, sustainable, and, healthy, food, system, in, 2019, the, national, basic, research, program, or, program, 973, funded, research, into, science, and, technology, backyard, stb, stbs, are, hubs, often, created, in, rural, areas, with, significant, rates, of, small, scale, farming, that, combine, knowledge, of, traditional, practices, with, new, innovations, and, technology, implementation, the, purpose, of, this, program, was, to, invest, in, sustainable, farming, throughout, the, country, and, increase, food, production, while, achieving, few, negative, environmental, effects, the, program, was, ultimately, proven, to, be, successful, and, the, study, found, that, the, merging, of, traditional, practices, and, appropriate, technology, was, instrumental, in, higher, crop, yields, in, collaboration, with, the, food, and, land, use, coalition, folu, ceew, council, for, energy, environment, and, water, has, given, an, overview, of, the, current, state, of, sustainable, agriculture, practices, and, systems, sapss, in, india, india, is, aiming, to, scale, up, saps, through, policymakers, administrators, philanthropists, and, other, which, represent, a, vital, alternative, to, conventional, input, intensive, agriculture, in, idea, these, efforts, identify, 16, sapss, including, agroforestry, crop, rotation, rainwater, harvesting, organic, farming, and, natural, farming, using, agroecology, as, an, investigative, lens, in, a, conclusive, understanding, it, is, realised, that, sustainable, agriculture, is, far, from, mainstream, in, india, further, proposals, for, several, measures, for, promoting, sapss, including, restructured, government, support, and, rigorous, evidence, generation, for, benefits, and, implementation, of, sustainable, farming, are, ongoing, progress, in, indian, agriculture, an, example, of, initiatives, in, india, towards, exploring, the, world, of, sustainable, farming, has, been, set, by, the, sowgood, foundation, which, is, a, nonprofit, founded, by, educator, pragati, chaswal, it, started, by, teaching, primary, school, children, about, sustainable, farming, by, helping, them, farm, on, small, farm, strips, in, suburban, farmhouses, and, gardens, today, many, government, and, private, schools, in, delhi, india, have, adopted, the, sowgood, foundation, curriculum, for, sustainable, farming, for, their, students, in, 2012, the, israeli, ministry, of, agriculture, found, itself, at, the, height, of, the, israeli, commitment, to, sustainable, agriculture, policy, a, large, factor, of, this, policy, was, funding, programs, that, made, sustainable, agriculture, accessible, to, smaller, palestinian, arab, communities, the, program, was, meant, to, create, biodiversity, train, farmers, in, sustainable, agriculture, methods, and, hold, regular, meetings, for, agriculture, stakeholders, this, plan, was, not, well, accepted, by, all, as, opposers, argue, that, the, plan, creates, a, new, social, construct, and, a, tool, for, the, government, to, hold, more, power, in, 1907, the, american, author, franklin, h, king, discussed, in, his, book, farmers, of, forty, centuries, the, advantages, of, sustainable, agriculture, and, warned, that, such, practices, would, be, vital, to, farming, in, the, future, the, phrase, sustainable, agriculture, was, reportedly, coined, by, the, australian, agronomist, gordon, mcclymont, the, term, became, popular, in, the, late, 1980s, there, was, an, international, symposium, on, sustainability, in, horticulture, by, the, international, society, of, horticultural, science, at, the, international, horticultural, congress, in, toronto, in, 2002, at, the, following, conference, at, seoul, in, 2006, the, principles, were, discussed, further, this, potential, future, inability, to, feed, the, world, s, population, has, been, a, concern, since, the, english, political, economist, thomas, malthus, in, the, early, 1800s, but, has, become, increasingly, important, recently, starting, at, the, very, end, of, the, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, this, issue, became, widely, discussed, in, the, u, s, because, of, growing, anxieties, of, a, rapidly, increasing, global, population, agriculture, has, long, been, the, biggest, industry, worldwide, and, requires, significant, land, water, and, labor, inputs, at, the, turn, of, the, twenty, first, century, experts, questioned, the, industry, s, ability, to, keep, up, with, population, growth, this, debate, led, to, concerns, over, global, food, insecurity, and, solving, hunger, this, article,
