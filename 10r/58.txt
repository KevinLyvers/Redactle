in, computing, booting, is, the, process, of, starting, a, computer, as, initiated, via, hardware, such, as, a, button, on, the, computer, or, by, a, software, command, after, it, is, switched, on, a, computer, s, central, processing, unit, cpu, has, no, software, in, its, main, memory, so, some, process, must, load, software, into, memory, before, it, can, be, executed, this, may, be, done, by, hardware, or, firmware, in, the, cpu, or, by, a, separate, processor, in, the, computer, system, restarting, a, computer, also, is, called, rebooting, which, can, be, hard, e, g, after, electrical, power, to, the, cpu, is, switched, from, off, to, on, or, soft, where, the, power, is, not, cut, on, some, systems, a, soft, boot, may, optionally, clear, ram, to, zero, both, hard, and, soft, booting, can, be, initiated, by, hardware, such, as, a, button, press, or, by, a, software, command, booting, is, complete, when, the, operative, runtime, system, typically, the, operating, system, and, some, applications, is, attained, the, process, of, returning, a, computer, from, a, state, of, sleep, suspension, does, not, involve, booting, however, restoring, it, from, a, state, of, hibernation, does, minimally, some, embedded, systems, do, not, require, a, noticeable, boot, sequence, to, begin, functioning, and, when, turned, on, may, simply, run, operational, programs, that, are, stored, in, rom, all, computing, systems, are, state, machines, and, a, reboot, may, be, the, only, method, to, return, to, a, designated, zero, state, from, an, unintended, locked, state, in, addition, to, loading, an, operating, system, or, stand, alone, utility, the, boot, process, can, also, load, a, storage, dump, program, for, diagnosing, problems, in, an, operating, system, boot, is, short, for, bootstrap, or, bootstrap, load, and, derives, from, the, phrase, to, pull, oneself, up, by, one, s, bootstraps, the, usage, calls, attention, to, the, requirement, that, if, most, software, is, loaded, onto, a, computer, by, other, software, already, running, on, the, computer, some, mechanism, must, exist, to, load, the, initial, software, onto, the, computer, early, computers, used, a, variety, of, ad, hoc, methods, to, get, a, small, program, into, memory, to, solve, this, problem, the, invention, of, read, only, memory, rom, of, various, types, solved, this, paradox, by, allowing, computers, to, be, shipped, with, a, start, up, program, that, could, not, be, erased, growth, in, the, capacity, of, rom, has, allowed, ever, more, elaborate, start, up, procedures, to, be, implemented, there, are, many, different, methods, available, to, load, a, short, initial, program, into, a, computer, these, methods, reach, from, simple, physical, input, to, removable, media, that, can, hold, more, complex, programs, early, computers, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, were, one, of, a, kind, engineering, efforts, that, could, take, weeks, to, program, and, program, loading, was, one, of, many, problems, that, had, to, be, solved, an, early, computer, eniac, had, no, program, stored, in, memory, but, was, set, up, for, each, problem, by, a, configuration, of, interconnecting, cables, bootstrapping, did, not, apply, to, eniac, whose, hardware, configuration, was, ready, for, solving, problems, as, soon, as, power, was, applied, the, edsac, system, the, second, stored, program, computer, to, be, built, used, stepping, switches, to, transfer, a, fixed, program, into, memory, when, its, start, button, was, pressed, the, program, stored, on, this, device, which, david, wheeler, completed, in, late, 1948, loaded, further, instructions, from, punched, tape, and, then, executed, them, the, first, programmable, computers, for, commercial, sale, such, as, the, univac, i, and, the, ibm, 701, included, features, to, make, their, operation, simpler, they, typically, included, instructions, that, performed, a, complete, input, or, output, operation, the, same, hardware, logic, could, be, used, to, load, the, contents, of, a, punch, card, the, most, typical, ones, or, other, input, media, such, as, a, magnetic, drum, or, magnetic, tape, that, contained, a, bootstrap, program, by, pressing, a, single, button, this, booting, concept, was, called, a, variety, of, names, for, ibm, computers, of, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, but, ibm, used, the, term, initial, program, load, with, the, ibm, 7030, stretch, and, later, used, it, for, their, mainframe, lines, starting, with, the, system, 360, in, 1964, the, ibm, 701, computer, 1952, 1956, had, a, load, button, that, initiated, reading, of, the, first, 36, bit, word, into, main, memory, from, a, punched, card, in, a, card, reader, a, magnetic, tape, in, a, tape, drive, or, a, magnetic, drum, unit, depending, on, the, position, of, the, load, selector, switch, the, left, 18, bit, half, word, was, then, executed, as, an, instruction, which, usually, read, additional, words, into, memory, the, loaded, boot, program, was, then, executed, which, in, turn, loaded, a, larger, program, from, that, medium, into, memory, without, further, help, from, the, human, operator, the, ibm, 704, ibm, 7090, and, ibm, 7094, had, similar, mechanisms, but, with, different, load, buttons, for, different, devices, the, term, boot, has, been, used, in, this, sense, since, at, least, 1958, other, ibm, computers, of, that, era, had, similar, features, for, example, the, ibm, 1401, system, c, 1958, used, a, card, reader, to, load, a, program, from, a, punched, card, the, 80, characters, stored, in, the, punched, card, were, read, into, memory, locations, 001, to, 080, then, the, computer, would, branch, to, memory, location, 001, to, read, its, first, stored, instruction, this, instruction, was, always, the, same, move, the, information, in, these, first, 80, memory, locations, to, an, assembly, area, where, the, information, in, punched, cards, 2, 3, 4, and, so, on, could, be, combined, to, form, the, stored, program, once, this, information, was, moved, to, the, assembly, area, the, machine, would, branch, to, an, instruction, in, location, 080, read, a, card, and, the, next, card, would, be, read, and, its, information, processed, another, example, was, the, ibm, 650, 1953, a, decimal, machine, which, had, a, group, of, ten, 10, position, switches, on, its, operator, panel, which, were, addressable, as, a, memory, word, address, 8000, and, could, be, executed, as, an, instruction, thus, setting, the, switches, to, 7004000400, and, pressing, the, appropriate, button, would, read, the, first, card, in, the, card, reader, into, memory, op, code, 70, starting, at, address, 400, and, then, jump, to, 400, to, begin, executing, the, program, on, that, card, the, ibm, 7040, and, 7044, have, a, similar, mechanism, in, which, the, load, button, causes, the, instruction, set, up, in, the, entry, keys, on, the, front, panel, is, executed, and, the, channel, that, instruction, sets, up, is, given, a, command, to, transfer, data, to, memory, starting, at, address, 00100, when, that, transfer, finishes, the, cpu, jumps, to, address, 00101, ibm, s, competitors, also, offered, single, button, program, load, a, noteworthy, variation, of, this, is, found, on, the, burroughs, b1700, where, there, is, neither, a, bootstrap, rom, nor, a, hardwired, ipl, operation, instead, after, the, system, is, reset, it, reads, and, executes, microinstructions, sequentially, from, a, cassette, tape, drive, mounted, on, the, front, panel, this, sets, up, a, boot, loader, in, ram, which, is, then, executed, however, since, this, makes, few, assumptions, about, the, system, it, can, equally, well, be, used, to, load, diagnostic, maintenance, test, routine, tapes, which, display, an, intelligible, code, on, the, front, panel, even, in, cases, of, gross, cpu, failure, in, the, ibm, system, 360, and, its, successors, including, the, current, z, architecture, machines, the, boot, process, is, known, as, initial, program, load, ipl, ibm, coined, this, term, for, the, 7030, stretch, revived, it, for, the, design, of, the, system, 360, and, continues, to, use, it, in, those, environments, today, in, the, system, 360, processors, an, ipl, is, initiated, by, the, computer, operator, by, selecting, the, three, hexadecimal, digit, device, address, cuu, c, i, o, channel, address, uu, control, unit, and, device, address, followed, by, pressing, the, load, button, on, the, high, end, system, 360, models, most, system, 370, and, some, later, systems, the, functions, of, the, switches, and, the, load, button, are, simulated, using, selectable, areas, on, the, screen, of, a, graphics, console, often, an, ibm, 2250, like, device, or, an, ibm, 3270, like, device, for, example, on, the, system, 370, model, 158, the, keyboard, sequence, 0, 7, x, zero, seven, and, x, in, that, order, results, in, an, ipl, from, the, device, address, which, was, keyed, into, the, input, area, the, amdahl, 470v, 6, and, related, cpus, supported, four, hexadecimal, digits, on, those, cpus, which, had, the, optional, second, channel, unit, installed, for, a, total, of, 32, channels, later, ibm, would, also, support, more, than, 16, channels, the, ipl, function, in, the, system, 360, and, its, successors, prior, to, ibm, z, and, its, compatibles, such, as, amdahl, s, reads, 24, bytes, from, an, operator, specified, device, into, main, storage, starting, at, real, address, zero, the, second, and, third, groups, of, eight, bytes, are, treated, as, channel, command, words, ccws, to, continue, loading, the, startup, program, the, first, ccw, is, always, simulated, by, the, cpu, and, consists, of, a, read, ipl, command, 02h, with, command, chaining, and, suppress, incorrect, length, indication, being, enforced, when, the, i, o, channel, commands, are, complete, the, first, group, of, eight, bytes, is, then, loaded, into, the, processor, s, program, status, word, psw, and, the, startup, program, begins, execution, at, the, location, designated, by, that, psw, the, ipl, device, is, usually, a, disk, drive, hence, the, special, significance, of, the, 02h, read, type, command, but, exactly, the, same, procedure, is, also, used, to, ipl, from, other, input, type, devices, such, as, tape, drives, or, even, card, readers, in, a, device, independent, manner, allowing, for, example, the, installation, of, an, operating, system, on, a, brand, new, computer, from, an, os, initial, distribution, magnetic, tape, for, disk, controllers, the, 02h, command, also, causes, the, selected, device, to, seek, to, cylinder, 0000h, head, 0000h, simulating, a, seek, cylinder, and, head, command, 07h, and, to, search, for, record, 01h, simulating, a, search, id, equal, command, 31h, seeks, and, searches, are, not, simulated, by, tape, and, card, controllers, as, for, these, device, classes, a, read, ipl, command, is, simply, a, sequential, read, command, the, disk, tape, or, card, deck, must, contain, a, special, program, to, load, the, actual, operating, system, or, standalone, utility, into, main, storage, and, for, this, specific, purpose, ipl, text, is, placed, on, the, disk, by, the, stand, alone, dasdi, direct, access, storage, device, initialization, program, or, an, equivalent, program, running, under, an, operating, system, e, g, ickdsf, but, ipl, able, tapes, and, card, decks, are, usually, distributed, with, this, ipl, text, already, present, ibm, introduced, some, evolutionary, changes, in, the, ipl, process, changing, some, details, for, system, 370, extended, architecture, s, 370, xa, and, later, and, adding, a, new, type, of, ipl, for, z, architecture, minicomputers, starting, with, the, digital, equipment, corporation, dec, pdp, 5, and, pdp, 8, 1965, simplified, design, by, using, the, cpu, to, assist, input, and, output, operations, this, saved, cost, but, made, booting, more, complicated, than, pressing, a, single, button, minicomputers, typically, had, some, way, to, toggle, in, short, programs, by, manipulating, an, array, of, switches, on, the, front, panel, since, the, early, minicomputers, used, magnetic, core, memory, which, did, not, lose, its, information, when, power, was, off, these, bootstrap, loaders, would, remain, in, place, unless, they, were, erased, erasure, sometimes, happened, accidentally, when, a, program, bug, caused, a, loop, that, overwrote, all, of, memory, other, minicomputers, with, such, simple, form, of, booting, include, hewlett, packard, s, hp, 2100, series, mid, 1960s, the, original, data, general, nova, 1969, and, dec, s, pdp, 4, 1962, and, pdp, 11, 1970, as, the, i, o, operations, needed, to, cause, a, read, operation, on, a, minicomputer, i, o, device, were, typically, different, for, different, device, controllers, different, bootstrap, programs, were, needed, for, different, devices, dec, later, added, in, 1971, an, optional, diode, matrix, read, only, memory, for, the, pdp, 11, that, stored, a, bootstrap, program, of, up, to, 32, words, 64, bytes, it, consisted, of, a, printed, circuit, card, the, m792, that, plugged, into, the, unibus, and, held, a, 32, by, 16, array, of, semiconductor, diodes, with, all, 512, diodes, in, place, the, memory, contained, all, one, bits, the, card, was, programmed, by, cutting, off, each, diode, whose, bit, was, to, be, zero, dec, also, sold, versions, of, the, card, the, bm792, yx, series, pre, programmed, for, many, standard, input, devices, by, simply, omitting, the, unneeded, diodes, following, the, older, approach, the, earlier, pdp, 1, has, a, hardware, loader, such, that, an, operator, need, only, push, the, load, switch, to, instruct, the, paper, tape, reader, to, load, a, program, directly, into, core, memory, the, pdp, 7, pdp, 9, and, pdp, 15, successors, to, the, pdp, 4, have, an, added, read, in, button, to, read, a, program, in, from, paper, tape, and, jump, to, it, the, data, general, supernova, used, front, panel, switches, to, cause, the, computer, to, automatically, load, instructions, into, memory, from, a, device, specified, by, the, front, panel, s, data, switches, and, then, jump, to, loaded, code, in, a, minicomputer, with, a, paper, tape, reader, the, first, program, to, run, in, the, boot, process, the, boot, loader, would, read, into, core, memory, either, the, second, stage, boot, loader, often, called, a, binary, loader, that, could, read, paper, tape, with, checksum, or, the, operating, system, from, an, outside, storage, medium, pseudocode, for, the, boot, loader, might, be, as, simple, as, the, following, eight, instructions, a, related, example, is, based, on, a, loader, for, a, nicolet, instrument, corporation, minicomputer, of, the, 1970s, using, the, paper, tape, reader, punch, unit, on, a, teletype, model, 33, asr, teleprinter, the, bytes, of, its, second, stage, loader, are, read, from, paper, tape, in, reverse, order, the, length, of, the, second, stage, loader, is, such, that, the, final, byte, overwrites, location, 7, after, the, instruction, in, location, 6, executes, location, 7, starts, the, second, stage, loader, executing, the, second, stage, loader, then, waits, for, the, much, longer, tape, containing, the, operating, system, to, be, placed, in, the, tape, reader, the, difference, between, the, boot, loader, and, second, stage, loader, is, the, addition, of, checking, code, to, trap, paper, tape, read, errors, a, frequent, occurrence, with, relatively, low, cost, part, time, duty, hardware, such, as, the, teletype, model, 33, asr, friden, flexowriters, were, far, more, reliable, but, also, comparatively, costly, the, earliest, microcomputers, such, as, the, altair, 8800, released, first, in, 1975, and, an, even, earlier, similar, machine, based, on, the, intel, 8008, cpu, had, no, bootstrapping, hardware, as, such, when, powered, up, the, cpu, would, see, memory, that, would, contain, random, data, the, front, panels, of, these, machines, carried, toggle, switches, for, entering, addresses, and, data, one, switch, per, bit, of, the, computer, memory, word, and, address, bus, simple, additions, to, the, hardware, permitted, one, memory, location, at, a, time, to, be, loaded, from, those, switches, to, store, bootstrap, code, meanwhile, the, cpu, was, kept, from, attempting, to, execute, memory, content, once, correctly, loaded, the, cpu, was, enabled, to, execute, the, bootstrapping, code, this, process, similar, to, that, used, for, several, earlier, minicomputers, was, tedious, and, had, to, be, error, free, the, introduction, of, integrated, circuit, read, only, memory, rom, with, its, many, variants, including, mask, programmed, roms, programmable, roms, prom, erasable, programmable, roms, eprom, and, flash, memory, reduced, the, physical, size, and, cost, of, rom, this, allowed, firmware, boot, programs, to, be, included, as, part, of, the, computer, the, data, general, nova, 1200, 1970, and, nova, 800, 1971, had, a, program, load, switch, that, in, combination, with, options, that, provided, two, rom, chips, loaded, a, program, into, main, memory, from, those, rom, chips, and, jumped, to, it, digital, equipment, corporation, introduced, the, integrated, circuit, rom, based, bm873, 1974, m9301, 1977, m9312, 1978, rev11, a, and, rev11, c, mrv11, c, and, mrv11, d, rom, memories, all, usable, as, bootstrap, roms, the, pdp, 11, 34, 1976, pdp, 11, 60, 1977, pdp, 11, 24, 1979, and, most, later, models, include, boot, rom, modules, an, italian, telephone, switching, computer, called, gruppi, speciali, patented, in, 1975, by, alberto, ciaramella, a, researcher, at, cselt, included, an, external, rom, gruppi, speciali, was, starting, from, 1975, a, fully, single, button, machine, booting, into, the, operating, system, from, a, rom, memory, composed, from, semiconductors, not, from, ferrite, cores, although, the, rom, device, was, not, natively, embedded, in, the, computer, of, gruppi, speciali, due, to, the, design, of, the, machine, it, also, allowed, the, single, button, rom, booting, in, machines, not, designed, for, that, therefore, this, bootstrap, device, was, architecture, independent, e, g, the, pdp, 11, storing, the, state, of, the, machine, after, the, switch, off, was, also, in, place, which, was, another, critical, feature, in, the, telephone, switching, contest, some, minicomputers, and, superminicomputers, include, a, separate, console, processor, that, bootstraps, the, main, processor, the, pdp, 11, 44, had, an, intel, 8085, as, a, console, processor, the, vax, 11, 780, the, first, member, of, digital, s, vax, line, of, 32, bit, superminicomputers, had, an, lsi, 11, based, console, processor, and, the, vax, 11, 730, had, an, 8085, based, console, processor, these, console, processors, could, boot, the, main, processor, from, various, storage, devices, some, other, superminicomputers, such, as, the, vax, 11, 750, implement, console, functions, including, the, first, stage, of, booting, in, cpu, microcode, typically, a, microprocessor, will, after, a, reset, or, power, on, condition, perform, a, start, up, process, that, usually, takes, the, form, of, begin, execution, of, the, code, that, is, found, starting, at, a, specific, address, or, look, for, a, multibyte, code, at, a, specific, address, and, jump, to, the, indicated, location, to, begin, execution, a, system, built, using, that, microprocessor, will, have, the, permanent, rom, occupying, these, special, locations, so, that, the, system, always, begins, operating, without, operator, assistance, for, example, intel, x86, processors, always, start, by, running, the, instructions, beginning, at, f000, fff0, while, for, the, mos, 6502, processor, initialization, begins, by, reading, a, two, byte, vector, address, at, fffd, ms, byte, and, fffc, ls, byte, and, jumping, to, that, location, to, run, the, bootstrap, code, apple, computer, s, first, computer, the, apple, 1, introduced, in, 1976, featured, prom, chips, that, eliminated, the, need, for, a, front, panel, for, the, boot, process, as, was, the, case, with, the, altair, 8800, in, a, commercial, computer, according, to, apple, s, ad, announcing, it, no, more, switches, no, more, lights, the, firmware, in, proms, enables, you, to, enter, display, and, debug, programs, all, in, hex, from, the, keyboard, due, to, the, expense, of, read, only, memory, at, the, time, the, apple, ii, booted, its, disk, operating, systems, using, a, series, of, very, small, incremental, steps, each, passing, control, onward, to, the, next, phase, of, the, gradually, more, complex, boot, process, see, apple, dos, boot, loader, because, so, little, of, the, disk, operating, system, relied, on, rom, the, hardware, was, also, extremely, flexible, and, supported, a, wide, range, of, customized, disk, copy, protection, mechanisms, see, software, cracking, history, some, operating, systems, most, notably, pre, 1995, macintosh, systems, from, apple, are, so, closely, interwoven, with, their, hardware, that, it, is, impossible, to, natively, boot, an, operating, system, other, than, the, standard, one, this, is, the, opposite, extreme, of, the, scenario, using, switches, mentioned, above, it, is, highly, inflexible, but, relatively, error, proof, and, foolproof, as, long, as, all, hardware, is, working, normally, a, common, solution, in, such, situations, is, to, design, a, boot, loader, that, works, as, a, program, belonging, to, the, standard, os, that, hijacks, the, system, and, loads, the, alternative, os, this, technique, was, used, by, apple, for, its, a, ux, unix, implementation, and, copied, by, various, freeware, operating, systems, and, beos, personal, edition, 5, some, machines, like, the, atari, st, microcomputer, were, instant, on, with, the, operating, system, executing, from, a, rom, retrieval, of, the, os, from, secondary, or, tertiary, store, was, thus, eliminated, as, one, of, the, characteristic, operations, for, bootstrapping, to, allow, system, customizations, accessories, and, other, support, software, to, be, loaded, automatically, the, atari, s, floppy, drive, was, read, for, additional, components, during, the, boot, process, there, was, a, timeout, delay, that, provided, time, to, manually, insert, a, floppy, as, the, system, searched, for, the, extra, components, this, could, be, avoided, by, inserting, a, blank, disk, the, atari, st, hardware, was, also, designed, so, the, cartridge, slot, could, provide, native, program, execution, for, gaming, purposes, as, a, holdover, from, atari, s, legacy, making, electronic, games, by, inserting, the, spectre, gcr, cartridge, with, the, macintosh, system, rom, in, the, game, slot, and, turning, the, atari, on, it, could, natively, boot, the, macintosh, operating, system, rather, than, atari, s, own, tos, the, ibm, personal, computer, included, rom, based, firmware, called, the, bios, one, of, the, functions, of, that, firmware, was, to, perform, a, power, on, self, test, when, the, machine, was, powered, up, and, then, to, read, software, from, a, boot, device, and, execute, it, firmware, compatible, with, the, bios, on, the, ibm, personal, computer, is, used, in, ibm, pc, compatible, computers, the, uefi, was, developed, by, intel, originally, for, itanium, based, machines, and, later, also, used, as, an, alternative, to, the, bios, in, x86, based, machines, including, apple, macs, using, intel, processors, unix, workstations, originally, had, vendor, specific, rom, based, firmware, sun, microsystems, later, developed, openboot, later, known, as, open, firmware, which, incorporated, a, forth, interpreter, with, much, of, the, firmware, being, written, in, forth, it, was, standardized, by, the, ieee, as, ieee, standard, 1275, 1994, firmware, that, implements, that, standard, was, used, in, powerpc, based, macs, and, some, other, powerpc, based, machines, as, well, as, sun, s, own, sparc, based, computers, the, advanced, risc, computing, specification, defined, another, firmware, standard, which, was, implemented, on, some, mips, based, and, alpha, based, machines, and, the, sgi, visual, workstation, x86, based, workstations, when, a, computer, is, turned, off, its, software, including, operating, systems, application, code, and, data, remains, stored, on, non, volatile, memory, when, the, computer, is, powered, on, it, typically, does, not, have, an, operating, system, or, its, loader, in, random, access, memory, ram, the, computer, first, executes, a, relatively, small, program, stored, in, read, only, memory, rom, and, later, eeprom, nor, flash, which, support, execute, in, place, to, initialize, cpu, and, motherboard, to, initialize, dram, especially, on, x86, systems, to, access, the, nonvolatile, device, usually, block, addressed, device, e, g, nand, flash, ssd, or, devices, from, which, the, operating, system, programs, and, data, can, be, loaded, into, ram, the, small, program, that, starts, this, sequence, is, known, as, a, bootstrap, loader, bootstrap, or, boot, loader, often, multiple, stage, boot, loaders, are, used, during, which, several, programs, of, increasing, complexity, load, one, after, the, other, in, a, process, of, chain, loading, some, earlier, computer, systems, upon, receiving, a, boot, signal, from, a, human, operator, or, a, peripheral, device, may, load, a, very, small, number, of, fixed, instructions, into, memory, at, a, specific, location, initialize, at, least, one, cpu, and, then, point, the, cpu, to, the, instructions, and, start, their, execution, these, instructions, typically, start, an, input, operation, from, some, peripheral, device, which, may, be, switch, selectable, by, the, operator, other, systems, may, send, hardware, commands, directly, to, peripheral, devices, or, i, o, controllers, that, cause, an, extremely, simple, input, operation, such, as, read, sector, zero, of, the, system, device, into, memory, starting, at, location, 1000, to, be, carried, out, effectively, loading, a, small, number, of, boot, loader, instructions, into, memory, a, completion, signal, from, the, i, o, device, may, then, be, used, to, start, execution, of, the, instructions, by, the, cpu, smaller, computers, often, use, less, flexible, but, more, automatic, boot, loader, mechanisms, to, ensure, that, the, computer, starts, quickly, and, with, a, predetermined, software, configuration, in, many, desktop, computers, for, example, the, bootstrapping, process, begins, with, the, cpu, executing, software, contained, in, rom, for, example, the, bios, of, an, ibm, pc, at, a, predefined, address, some, cpus, including, the, intel, x86, series, are, designed, to, execute, this, software, after, reset, without, outside, help, this, software, contains, rudimentary, functionality, to, search, for, devices, eligible, to, participate, in, booting, and, load, a, small, program, from, a, special, section, most, commonly, the, boot, sector, of, the, most, promising, device, typically, starting, at, a, fixed, entry, point, such, as, the, start, of, the, sector, boot, loaders, may, face, peculiar, constraints, especially, in, size, for, instance, on, the, ibm, pc, and, compatibles, the, boot, code, must, fit, in, the, master, boot, record, mbr, and, the, partition, boot, record, pbr, which, in, turn, are, limited, to, a, single, sector, on, the, ibm, system, 360, the, size, is, limited, by, the, ipl, medium, e, g, card, size, track, size, on, systems, with, those, constraints, the, first, program, loaded, into, ram, may, not, be, sufficiently, large, to, load, the, operating, system, and, instead, must, load, another, larger, program, the, first, program, loaded, into, ram, is, called, a, first, stage, boot, loader, and, the, program, it, loads, is, called, a, second, stage, boot, loader, on, many, embedded, cpus, the, cpu, built, in, boot, rom, sometimes, called, the, zero, stage, boot, loader, can, find, and, load, first, stage, boot, loaders, examples, of, first, stage, hardware, initialization, stage, boot, loaders, include, bios, uefi, coreboot, libreboot, and, das, u, boot, on, the, ibm, pc, the, boot, loader, in, the, master, boot, record, mbr, and, the, partition, boot, record, pbr, was, coded, to, require, at, least, 32, kb, later, expanded, to, 64, kb, of, system, memory, and, only, use, instructions, supported, by, the, original, 8088, 8086, processors, second, stage, os, initialization, stage, boot, loaders, such, as, shim, gnu, grub, refind, bootmgr, syslinux, ntldr, and, iboot, are, not, themselves, operating, systems, but, are, able, to, load, an, operating, system, properly, and, transfer, execution, to, it, the, operating, system, subsequently, initializes, itself, and, may, load, extra, device, drivers, the, second, stage, boot, loader, does, not, need, drivers, for, its, own, operation, but, may, instead, use, generic, storage, access, methods, provided, by, system, firmware, such, as, the, bios, uefi, or, open, firmware, though, typically, with, restricted, hardware, functionality, and, lower, performance, many, boot, loaders, like, gnu, grub, refind, windows, s, bootmgr, syslinux, and, windows, nt, 2000, xp, s, ntldr, can, be, configured, to, give, the, user, multiple, booting, choices, these, choices, can, include, different, operating, systems, for, dual, or, multi, booting, from, different, partitions, or, drives, different, versions, of, the, same, operating, system, in, case, a, new, version, has, unexpected, problems, different, operating, system, loading, options, e, g, booting, into, a, rescue, or, safe, mode, and, some, standalone, programs, that, can, function, without, an, operating, system, such, as, memory, testers, e, g, memtest86, a, basic, shell, as, in, gnu, grub, or, even, games, see, list, of, pc, booter, games, some, boot, loaders, can, also, load, other, boot, loaders, for, example, grub, loads, bootmgr, instead, of, loading, windows, directly, usually, a, default, choice, is, preselected, with, a, time, delay, during, which, a, user, can, press, a, key, to, change, the, choice, after, this, delay, the, default, choice, is, automatically, run, so, normal, booting, can, occur, without, interaction, the, boot, process, can, be, considered, complete, when, the, computer, is, ready, to, interact, with, the, user, or, the, operating, system, is, capable, of, running, system, programs, or, application, programs, many, embedded, systems, must, boot, immediately, for, example, waiting, a, minute, for, a, digital, television, or, a, gps, navigation, device, to, start, is, generally, unacceptable, therefore, such, devices, have, software, systems, in, rom, or, flash, memory, so, the, device, can, begin, functioning, immediately, little, or, no, loading, is, necessary, because, the, loading, can, be, precomputed, and, stored, on, the, rom, when, the, device, is, made, large, and, complex, systems, may, have, boot, procedures, that, proceed, in, multiple, phases, until, finally, the, operating, system, and, other, programs, are, loaded, and, ready, to, execute, because, operating, systems, are, designed, as, if, they, never, start, or, stop, a, boot, loader, might, load, the, operating, system, configure, itself, as, a, mere, process, within, that, system, and, then, irrevocably, transfer, control, to, the, operating, system, the, boot, loader, then, terminates, normally, as, any, other, process, would, most, computers, are, also, capable, of, booting, over, a, computer, network, in, this, scenario, the, operating, system, is, stored, on, the, disk, of, a, server, and, certain, parts, of, it, are, transferred, to, the, client, using, a, simple, protocol, such, as, the, trivial, file, transfer, protocol, tftp, after, these, parts, have, been, transferred, the, operating, system, takes, over, the, control, of, the, booting, process, as, with, the, second, stage, boot, loader, network, booting, begins, by, using, generic, network, access, methods, provided, by, the, network, interface, s, boot, rom, which, typically, contains, a, preboot, execution, environment, pxe, image, no, drivers, are, required, but, the, system, functionality, is, limited, until, the, operating, system, kernel, and, drivers, are, transferred, and, started, as, a, result, once, the, rom, based, booting, has, completed, it, is, entirely, possible, to, network, boot, into, an, operating, system, that, itself, does, not, have, the, ability, to, use, the, network, interface, the, boot, device, is, the, storage, device, from, which, the, operating, system, is, loaded, a, modern, pc, s, uefi, or, bios, firmware, supports, booting, from, various, devices, typically, a, local, solid, state, drive, or, hard, disk, drive, via, the, gpt, or, master, boot, record, mbr, on, such, a, drive, or, disk, an, optical, disc, drive, using, el, torito, a, usb, mass, storage, device, usb, flash, drive, memory, card, reader, usb, hard, disk, drive, usb, optical, disc, drive, usb, solid, state, drive, etc, or, a, network, interface, card, using, pxe, older, less, common, bios, bootable, devices, include, floppy, disk, drives, zip, drives, and, ls, 120, drives, typically, the, system, firmware, uefi, or, bios, will, allow, the, user, to, configure, a, boot, order, if, the, boot, order, is, set, to, first, the, dvd, drive, second, the, hard, disk, drive, then, the, firmware, will, try, to, boot, from, the, dvd, drive, and, if, this, fails, e, g, because, there, is, no, dvd, in, the, drive, it, will, try, to, boot, from, the, local, hard, disk, drive, for, example, on, a, pc, with, windows, installed, on, the, hard, drive, the, user, could, set, the, boot, order, to, the, one, given, above, and, then, insert, a, linux, live, cd, in, order, to, try, out, linux, without, having, to, install, an, operating, system, onto, the, hard, drive, this, is, an, example, of, dual, booting, in, which, the, user, chooses, which, operating, system, to, start, after, the, computer, has, performed, its, power, on, self, test, post, in, this, example, of, dual, booting, the, user, chooses, by, inserting, or, removing, the, dvd, from, the, computer, but, it, is, more, common, to, choose, which, operating, system, to, boot, by, selecting, from, a, boot, manager, menu, on, the, selected, device, by, using, the, computer, keyboard, to, select, from, a, bios, or, uefi, boot, menu, or, both, the, boot, menu, is, typically, entered, by, pressing, f8, or, f12, keys, during, the, post, the, bios, setup, is, typically, entered, by, pressing, f2, or, del, keys, during, the, post, several, devices, are, available, that, enable, the, user, to, quick, boot, into, what, is, usually, a, variant, of, linux, for, various, simple, tasks, such, as, internet, access, examples, are, splashtop, and, latitude, on, upon, starting, an, ibm, compatible, personal, computer, s, x86, cpu, executes, in, real, mode, the, instruction, located, at, reset, vector, the, physical, memory, address, ffff0h, on, 16, bit, x86, processors, and, fffffff0h, on, 32, bit, and, 64, bit, x86, processors, usually, pointing, to, the, firmware, uefi, or, bios, entry, point, inside, the, rom, this, memory, location, typically, contains, a, jump, instruction, that, transfers, execution, to, the, location, of, the, firmware, uefi, or, bios, start, up, program, this, program, runs, a, power, on, self, test, post, to, check, and, initialize, required, devices, such, as, main, memory, dram, the, pci, bus, and, the, pci, devices, including, running, embedded, option, roms, one, of, the, most, involved, steps, is, setting, up, dram, over, spd, further, complicated, by, the, fact, that, at, this, point, memory, is, very, limited, after, initializing, required, hardware, the, firmware, uefi, or, bios, goes, through, a, pre, configured, list, of, non, volatile, storage, devices, boot, device, sequence, until, it, finds, one, that, is, bootable, once, the, bios, has, found, a, bootable, device, it, loads, the, boot, sector, to, linear, address, 7c00h, usually, segment, offset, 0000h, 7c00h, 29, but, some, bioses, erroneously, use, 07c0h, 0000h, and, transfers, execution, to, the, boot, code, in, the, case, of, a, hard, disk, this, is, referred, to, as, the, master, boot, record, mbr, the, conventional, mbr, code, checks, the, mbr, s, partition, table, for, a, partition, set, as, bootable, the, one, with, active, flag, set, if, an, active, partition, is, found, the, mbr, code, loads, the, boot, sector, code, from, that, partition, known, as, volume, boot, record, vbr, and, executes, it, the, mbr, boot, code, is, often, operating, system, specific, a, bootable, mbr, device, is, defined, as, one, that, can, be, read, from, and, where, the, last, two, bytes, of, the, first, sector, contain, the, little, endian, word, aa55h, found, as, byte, sequence, 55h, aah, on, disk, also, known, as, the, mbr, boot, signature, or, where, it, is, otherwise, established, that, the, code, inside, the, sector, is, executable, on, x86, pcs, the, boot, sector, code, is, the, first, stage, boot, loader, it, is, located, on, fixed, disks, and, removable, drives, and, must, fit, into, the, first, 446, bytes, of, the, master, boot, record, in, order, to, leave, room, for, the, default, 64, byte, partition, table, with, four, partition, entries, and, the, two, byte, boot, signature, which, the, bios, requires, for, a, proper, boot, loader, or, even, less, when, additional, features, like, more, than, four, partition, entries, up, to, 16, with, 16, bytes, each, a, disk, signature, 6, bytes, a, disk, timestamp, 6, bytes, an, advanced, active, partition, 18, bytes, or, special, multi, boot, loaders, have, to, be, supported, as, well, in, some, environments, in, floppy, and, superfloppy, volume, boot, records, up, to, 59, bytes, are, occupied, for, the, extended, bios, parameter, block, on, fat12, and, fat16, volumes, since, dos, 4, 0, whereas, the, fat32, ebpb, introduced, with, dos, 7, 1, requires, even, 87, bytes, leaving, only, 423, bytes, for, the, boot, loader, when, assuming, a, sector, size, of, 512, bytes, microsoft, boot, sectors, therefore, traditionally, imposed, certain, restrictions, on, the, boot, process, for, example, the, boot, file, had, to, be, located, at, a, fixed, position, in, the, root, directory, of, the, file, system, and, stored, as, consecutive, sectors, conditions, taken, care, of, by, the, sys, command, and, slightly, relaxed, in, later, versions, of, dos, the, boot, loader, was, then, able, to, load, the, first, three, sectors, of, the, file, into, memory, which, happened, to, contain, another, embedded, boot, loader, able, to, load, the, remainder, of, the, file, into, memory, when, microsoft, added, lba, and, fat32, support, they, even, switched, to, a, boot, loader, reaching, over, two, physical, sectors, and, using, 386, instructions, for, size, reasons, at, the, same, time, other, vendors, managed, to, squeeze, much, more, functionality, into, a, single, boot, sector, without, relaxing, the, original, constraints, on, only, minimal, available, memory, 32, kb, and, processor, support, 8088, 8086, for, example, dr, dos, boot, sectors, are, able, to, locate, the, boot, file, in, the, fat12, fat16, and, fat32, file, system, and, load, it, into, memory, as, a, whole, via, chs, or, lba, even, if, the, file, is, not, stored, in, a, fixed, location, and, in, consecutive, sectors, the, vbr, is, often, os, specific, however, its, main, function, is, to, load, and, execute, the, operating, system, boot, loader, file, such, as, bootmgr, or, ntldr, which, is, the, second, stage, boot, loader, from, an, active, partition, then, the, boot, loader, loads, the, os, kernel, from, the, storage, device, if, there, is, no, active, partition, or, the, active, partition, s, boot, sector, is, invalid, the, mbr, may, load, a, secondary, boot, loader, which, will, select, a, partition, often, via, user, input, and, load, its, boot, sector, which, usually, loads, the, corresponding, operating, system, kernel, in, some, cases, the, mbr, may, also, attempt, to, load, secondary, boot, loaders, before, trying, to, boot, the, active, partition, if, all, else, fails, it, should, issue, an, int, 18h, bios, interrupt, call, followed, by, an, int, 19h, just, in, case, int, 18h, would, return, in, order, to, give, back, control, to, the, bios, which, would, then, attempt, to, boot, off, other, devices, attempt, a, remote, boot, via, network, many, modern, systems, intel, macs, and, newer, pcs, use, uefi, unlike, bios, uefi, not, legacy, boot, via, csm, does, not, rely, on, boot, sectors, uefi, system, loads, the, boot, loader, efi, application, file, in, usb, disk, or, in, the, efi, system, partition, directly, and, the, os, kernel, is, loaded, by, the, boot, loader, many, modern, cpus, socs, and, microcontrollers, for, example, ti, omap, or, sometimes, even, digital, signal, processors, dsps, may, have, boot, rom, integrated, directly, into, their, silicon, so, such, a, processor, can, perform, a, simple, boot, sequence, on, its, own, and, load, boot, programs, firmware, or, software, from, boot, sources, such, as, nand, flash, or, emmc, it, is, difficult, to, hardwire, all, the, required, logic, for, handling, such, devices, so, an, integrated, boot, rom, is, used, instead, in, such, scenarios, also, a, boot, rom, may, be, able, to, load, a, boot, loader, or, diagnostic, program, via, serial, interfaces, like, uart, spi, usb, and, so, on, this, feature, is, often, used, for, system, recovery, purposes, or, it, could, also, be, used, for, initial, non, volatile, memory, programming, when, there, is, no, software, available, in, the, non, volatile, memory, yet, many, modern, microcontrollers, e, g, flash, memory, controller, on, usb, flash, drives, have, firmware, rom, integrated, directly, into, their, silicon, some, embedded, system, designs, may, also, include, an, intermediary, boot, sequence, step, for, example, das, u, boot, may, be, split, into, two, stages, the, platform, would, load, a, small, spl, secondary, program, loader, which, is, a, stripped, down, version, of, u, boot, and, the, spl, would, do, some, initial, hardware, configuration, e, g, dram, initialization, using, cpu, cache, as, ram, and, load, the, larger, fully, featured, version, of, u, boot, some, cpus, and, socs, may, not, use, cpu, cache, as, ram, on, boot, process, they, use, an, integrated, boot, processor, to, do, some, hardware, configuration, to, reduce, cost, it, is, also, possible, to, take, control, of, a, system, by, using, a, hardware, debug, interface, such, as, jtag, such, an, interface, may, be, used, to, write, the, boot, loader, program, into, bootable, non, volatile, memory, e, g, flash, by, instructing, the, processor, core, to, perform, the, necessary, actions, to, program, non, volatile, memory, alternatively, the, debug, interface, may, be, used, to, upload, some, diagnostic, or, boot, code, into, ram, and, then, to, start, the, processor, core, and, instruct, it, to, execute, the, uploaded, code, this, allows, for, example, the, recovery, of, embedded, systems, where, no, software, remains, on, any, supported, boot, device, and, where, the, processor, does, not, have, any, integrated, boot, rom, jtag, is, a, standard, and, popular, interface, many, cpus, microcontrollers, and, other, devices, are, manufactured, with, jtag, interfaces, as, of, 2009, some, microcontrollers, provide, special, hardware, interfaces, which, cannot, be, used, to, take, arbitrary, control, of, a, system, or, directly, run, code, but, instead, they, allow, the, insertion, of, boot, code, into, bootable, non, volatile, memory, like, flash, memory, via, simple, protocols, then, at, the, manufacturing, phase, such, interfaces, are, used, to, inject, boot, code, and, possibly, other, code, into, non, volatile, memory, after, system, reset, the, microcontroller, begins, to, execute, code, programmed, into, its, non, volatile, memory, just, like, usual, processors, are, using, roms, for, booting, most, notably, this, technique, is, used, by, atmel, avr, microcontrollers, and, by, others, as, well, in, many, cases, such, interfaces, are, implemented, by, hardwired, logic, in, other, cases, such, interfaces, could, be, created, by, software, running, in, integrated, on, chip, boot, rom, from, gpio, pins, most, dsps, have, a, serial, mode, boot, and, a, parallel, mode, boot, such, as, the, host, port, interface, hpi, boot, in, case, of, dsps, there, is, often, a, second, microprocessor, or, microcontroller, present, in, the, system, design, and, this, is, responsible, for, overall, system, behavior, interrupt, handling, dealing, with, external, events, user, interface, etc, while, the, dsp, is, dedicated, to, signal, processing, tasks, only, in, such, systems, the, dsp, could, be, booted, by, another, processor, which, is, sometimes, referred, as, the, host, processor, giving, name, to, a, host, port, such, a, processor, is, also, sometimes, referred, as, the, master, since, it, usually, boots, first, from, its, own, memories, and, then, controls, overall, system, behavior, including, booting, of, the, dsp, and, then, further, controlling, the, dsp, s, behavior, the, dsp, often, lacks, its, own, boot, memories, and, relies, on, the, host, processor, to, supply, the, required, code, instead, the, most, notable, systems, with, such, a, design, are, cell, phones, modems, audio, and, video, players, and, so, on, where, a, dsp, and, a, cpu, microcontroller, are, co, existing, many, fpga, chips, load, their, configuration, from, an, external, serial, eeprom, configuration, rom, on, power, up, there, are, various, measures, have, been, implemented, which, enhance, the, security, of, the, booting, process, some, of, them, are, made, mandatory, others, can, be, disabled, or, enabled, by, the, end, user, traditionally, booting, did, not, involve, the, use, of, cryptography, the, security, can, be, bypassed, by, unlocking, the, boot, loader, which, might, or, might, not, be, approved, by, the, manufacturer, modern, boot, loaders, make, use, of, concurrency, meaning, they, can, run, multiple, processor, cores, and, threads, at, the, same, time, which, add, extra, layers, of, complexity, to, secure, booting, matthew, garrett, argued, that, booting, security, serves, a, legitimate, goal, but, in, doing, so, chooses, defaults, that, are, hostile, to, users, when, debugging, a, concurrent, and, distributed, system, of, systems, a, bootloop, also, called, boot, loop, or, boot, loop, is, a, diagnostic, condition, of, an, erroneous, state, that, occurs, on, computing, devices, when, those, devices, repeatedly, fail, to, complete, the, booting, process, and, restart, before, a, boot, sequence, is, finished, a, restart, might, prevent, a, user, from, accessing, the, regular, interface, as, the, complexity, of, today, s, products, increases, single, projects, single, departments, or, even, single, companies, can, no, longer, develop, total, products, causing, concurrent, and, distributed, development, today, and, worldwide, industries, are, facing, complex, product, development, and, its, vast, array, of, associated, problems, relating, to, project, organization, project, control, and, product, quality, many, processes, will, become, distributed, as, well, the, defect, detection, process, so, important, for, measuring, and, eventually, achieving, product, quality, is, typically, one, of, the, first, to, experience, problems, caused, by, the, distributed, nature, of, the, project, the, distribution, of, defect, detection, activities, over, several, parties, introduces, risks, like, the, inadequate, review, of, work, products, occurrence, of, blind, spots, with, respect, to, test, coverage, or, over, testing, of, components, lifecycle, wide, coordination, of, defect, detection, is, therefore, needed, to, ensure, effectiveness, and, efficiency, of, defect, detection, activities, j, j, m, trienekens, r, j, kusters, 2004, the, system, might, exhibit, its, erroneous, state, say, in, an, explicit, bootloop, or, blue, screen, of, death, before, recovery, is, indicated, detection, of, an, erroneous, state, may, require, a, distributed, event, store, and, stream, processing, platform, for, real, time, operation, of, a, distributed, system, an, erroneous, state, can, trigger, bootloops, this, state, can, be, caused, by, misconfiguration, from, previously, known, good, operations, recovery, attempts, from, that, erroneous, state, then, enter, a, reboot, in, an, attempt, to, return, to, a, known, good, state, in, windows, os, operations, for, example, the, recovery, procedure, was, to, reboot, three, times, the, reboots, needed, to, return, to, a, usable, menu, recovery, might, be, specified, via, security, assertion, markup, language, saml, which, can, also, implement, single, sign, on, sso, for, some, applications, in, the, zero, trust, security, model, identification, authorization, and, authentication, are, separable, concerns, in, an, sso, session, when, recovery, of, a, site, is, indicated, viz, a, blue, screen, of, death, is, displayed, on, an, airport, terminal, screen, personal, site, visits, might, be, required, to, remediate, the, situation
