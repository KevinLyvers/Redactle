in, transportation, freight, refers, to, goods, conveyed, by, land, water, or, air, while, cargo, refers, specifically, to, freight, when, conveyed, via, water, or, air, in, economics, freight, refers, to, goods, transported, at, a, freight, rate, for, commercial, gain, the, term, cargo, is, also, used, in, case, of, goods, in, the, cold, chain, because, the, perishable, inventory, is, always, in, transit, towards, a, final, end, use, even, when, it, is, held, in, cold, storage, or, other, similar, climate, controlled, facilities, including, warehouses, multi, modal, container, units, designed, as, reusable, carriers, to, facilitate, unit, load, handling, of, the, goods, contained, are, also, referred, to, as, cargo, especially, by, shipping, lines, and, logistics, operators, when, empty, containers, are, shipped, each, unit, is, documented, as, a, cargo, and, when, goods, are, stored, within, the, contents, are, termed, containerized, cargo, similarly, aircraft, uld, boxes, are, also, documented, as, cargo, with, an, associated, packing, list, of, the, items, contained, within, seaport, terminals, handle, a, wide, range, of, maritime, cargoes, break, bulk, general, cargo, are, goods, that, are, handled, and, stowed, piecemeal, to, some, degree, as, opposed, to, cargo, in, bulk, or, modern, shipping, containers, typically, bundled, in, batches, for, hoisting, either, with, cargo, nets, slings, crates, or, stacked, on, trays, pallets, or, skids, at, best, and, today, mostly, lifted, directly, into, and, out, of, a, vessel, s, holds, but, otherwise, onto, and, off, its, deck, by, cranes, or, derricks, present, on, the, dock, or, on, the, ship, itself, if, hoisted, on, deck, instead, of, straight, into, the, hold, liftable, or, rolling, unit, loads, like, bags, barrels, vats, boxes, cartons, and, crates, then, have, to, be, man, handled, and, stowed, competently, by, stevedores, securing, break, bulk, and, general, freight, inside, a, vessel, includes, the, use, of, dunnage, when, no, hoisting, equipment, is, available, break, bulk, would, previously, be, man, carried, on, and, off, the, ship, over, a, plank, or, by, passing, via, human, chain, since, the, 1960s, the, volume, of, break, bulk, cargo, has, enormously, declined, worldwide, in, favour, of, mass, adoption, of, containers, bulk, cargo, such, as, salt, oil, tallow, but, also, scrap, metal, is, usually, defined, as, commodities, that, are, neither, on, pallets, nor, in, containers, bulk, cargoes, are, not, handled, as, individual, pieces, the, way, heavy, lift, and, project, cargo, are, alumina, grain, gypsum, logs, and, wood, chips, for, instance, are, bulk, cargoes, bulk, cargo, is, classified, as, liquid, or, dry, air, cargo, refers, to, any, goods, shipped, by, air, whereas, air, freight, refers, specifically, to, goods, transported, in, the, cargo, hold, of, a, dedicated, cargo, plane, aircraft, were, first, used, to, carry, mail, as, cargo, in, 1911, eventually, manufacturers, started, designing, aircraft, for, other, types, of, freight, as, well, there, are, many, commercial, aircraft, suitable, for, carrying, cargo, such, as, the, boeing, 747, and, the, more, prominent, an, 124, which, was, purposely, built, for, easy, conversion, into, a, cargo, aircraft, such, large, aircraft, employ, standardized, quick, loading, containers, known, as, unit, load, devices, ulds, comparable, to, iso, containers, on, cargo, ships, ulds, can, be, stowed, in, the, lower, decks, front, and, rear, of, several, wide, body, aircraft, and, on, the, main, deck, of, some, narrow, bodies, some, dedicated, cargo, planes, have, a, large, opening, front, for, loading, air, freight, shipments, are, very, similar, to, ltl, shipments, in, terms, of, size, and, packaging, requirements, however, air, freight, or, air, cargo, shipments, typically, need, to, move, at, much, faster, speeds, than, 800, km, or, 497, mi, per, hour, while, shipments, move, faster, than, standard, ltl, air, shipments, do, not, always, actually, move, by, air, air, shipments, may, be, booked, directly, with, the, carriers, through, brokers, or, with, online, marketplace, services, in, the, us, there, are, certain, restrictions, on, cargo, moving, via, air, freight, on, passenger, aircraft, most, notably, the, transport, of, rechargeable, lithium, ion, battery, shipments, shippers, in, the, us, must, be, approved, and, be, known, in, the, known, shipper, management, system, before, their, shipments, can, be, tendered, on, passenger, aircraft, trains, are, capable, of, transporting, a, large, number, of, containers, that, come, from, shipping, ports, trains, are, also, used, to, transport, water, cement, grain, steel, wood, and, coal, they, are, used, because, they, can, carry, a, large, amount, and, generally, have, a, direct, route, to, the, destination, under, the, right, circumstances, freight, transport, by, rail, is, more, economical, and, energy, efficient, than, by, road, mainly, when, carried, in, bulk, or, over, long, distances, the, main, disadvantage, of, rail, freight, is, its, lack, of, flexibility, for, this, reason, rail, has, lost, much, of, the, freight, business, to, road, transport, rail, freight, is, often, subject, to, transshipment, costs, since, it, must, be, transferred, from, one, mode, of, transportation, to, another, practices, such, as, containerization, aim, at, minimizing, these, costs, when, transporting, point, to, point, bulk, loads, such, as, cement, or, grain, with, specialised, bulk, handling, facilities, at, the, rail, sidings, the, rail, mode, of, transport, remains, the, most, convenient, and, preferred, option, many, governments, are, encouraging, shippers, to, increase, their, use, of, rail, rather, than, transport, because, of, trains, lower, environmental, disbenefits, many, firms, like, parcelforce, fedex, and, r, l, carriers, transport, all, types, of, cargo, by, road, delivering, everything, from, letters, to, houses, to, cargo, containers, these, firms, offer, fast, sometimes, same, day, delivery, a, good, example, of, road, cargo, is, food, as, supermarkets, require, deliveries, daily, to, replenish, their, shelves, with, goods, retailers, and, manufacturers, of, all, kinds, rely, upon, delivery, trucks, be, they, full, size, semi, trucks, or, smaller, delivery, vans, these, smaller, road, haulage, companies, constantly, strive, for, the, best, routes, and, prices, to, ship, out, their, products, indeed, the, level, of, commercial, freight, transported, by, smaller, businesses, is, often, a, good, barometer, of, healthy, economic, development, as, these, types, of, vehicles, move, and, transport, anything, literally, including, couriers, transporting, parcels, and, mail, you, can, see, the, different, types, and, weights, of, vehicles, that, are, used, to, move, cargo, around, less, than, truckload, ltl, cargo, is, the, first, category, of, freight, shipment, representing, the, majority, of, freight, shipments, and, the, majority, of, business, to, business, b2b, shipments, ltl, shipments, are, also, often, referred, to, as, motor, freight, and, the, carriers, involved, are, referred, to, as, motor, carriers, ltl, shipments, range, from, 50, to, 7, 000, kg, 110, to, 15, 430, lb, being, less, than, 2, 5, to, 8, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, 4, in, to, 27, ft, 10, 6, in, the, majority, of, times, the, average, single, piece, of, ltl, freight, is, 600, kg, 1, 323, lb, and, the, size, of, a, standard, pallet, long, freight, and, or, large, freight, are, subject, to, extreme, length, and, cubic, capacity, surcharges, trailers, used, in, ltl, can, range, from, 28, to, 53, ft, 8, 53, to, 16, 15, m, the, standard, for, city, deliveries, is, usually, 48, ft, 14, 63, m, in, tight, and, residential, environments, the, 28, ft, 8, 53, m, trailer, is, used, the, most, the, shipments, are, usually, palletized, stretch, wrapped, and, packaged, for, a, mixed, freight, environment, unlike, express, or, parcel, ltl, shippers, must, provide, their, own, packaging, as, carriers, do, not, provide, any, packaging, supplies, or, assistance, however, circumstances, may, require, crating, or, another, substantial, packaging, in, the, united, states, shipments, larger, than, about, 7, 000, kg, 15, 432, lb, are, typically, classified, as, truckload, tl, freight, this, is, because, it, is, more, efficient, and, economical, for, a, large, shipment, to, have, exclusive, use, of, one, larger, trailer, rather, than, share, space, on, a, smaller, ltl, trailer, by, the, federal, bridge, gross, weight, formula, the, total, weight, of, a, loaded, truck, tractor, and, trailer, 5, axle, rig, cannot, exceed, 80, 000, lb, 36, 287, kg, in, the, united, states, in, ordinary, circumstances, long, haul, equipment, will, weigh, about, 15, 000, kg, 33, 069, lb, leaving, about, 20, 000, kg, 44, 092, lb, of, freight, capacity, similarly, a, load, is, limited, to, the, space, available, in, the, trailer, normally, 48, ft, 14, 63, m, or, 53, ft, 16, 15, m, long, 2, 6, m, 102, 3, 8, in, wide, 9, ft, 0, in, 2, 74, m, high, and, 13, ft, 6, in, or, 4, 11, m, high, overall, while, express, parcel, and, ltl, shipments, are, always, intermingled, with, other, shipments, on, a, single, piece, of, equipment, and, are, typically, reloaded, across, multiple, pieces, of, equipment, during, their, transport, tl, shipments, usually, travel, as, the, only, shipment, on, a, trailer, in, fact, tl, shipments, usually, deliver, on, exactly, the, same, trailer, as, they, are, picked, up, on, freight, is, usually, organized, into, various, shipment, categories, before, it, is, transported, an, item, s, category, is, determined, by, shipments, are, typically, categorized, as, household, goods, express, parcel, and, freight, shipments, an, ltl, shipper, often, realizes, savings, by, utilizing, a, freight, broker, online, marketplace, or, another, intermediary, instead, of, contracting, directly, with, a, trucking, company, brokers, can, shop, the, marketplace, and, obtain, lower, rates, than, most, smaller, shippers, can, obtain, directly, in, the, ltl, marketplace, intermediaries, typically, receive, 50, to, 80, discounts, from, published, rates, whereas, a, small, shipper, may, only, be, offered, a, 5, to, 30, discount, by, the, carrier, intermediaries, are, licensed, by, the, dot, and, have, the, requirements, to, provide, proof, of, insurance, truckload, tl, carriers, usually, charge, a, rate, per, kilometre, or, mile, the, rate, varies, depending, on, the, distance, geographic, location, of, the, delivery, items, being, shipped, equipment, type, required, and, service, times, required, tl, shipments, usually, receive, a, variety, of, surcharges, very, similar, to, those, described, for, ltl, shipments, above, there, are, thousands, more, small, carriers, in, the, tl, market, than, in, the, ltl, market, therefore, the, use, of, transportation, intermediaries, or, brokers, is, widespread, another, cost, saving, method, is, facilitating, pickups, or, deliveries, at, the, carrier, s, terminals, carriers, or, intermediaries, can, provide, shippers, with, the, address, and, phone, number, for, the, closest, shipping, terminal, to, the, origin, and, or, destination, by, doing, this, shippers, avoid, any, accessorial, fees, that, might, normally, be, charged, for, liftgate, residential, pickup, delivery, inside, pickup, delivery, or, notifications, appointments, shipping, experts, optimize, their, service, and, costs, by, sampling, rates, from, several, carriers, brokers, and, online, marketplaces, when, obtaining, rates, from, different, providers, shippers, may, find, a, wide, range, in, the, pricing, offered, if, a, shipper, in, the, united, states, uses, a, broker, freight, forwarder, or, another, transportation, intermediary, it, is, common, for, the, shipper, to, receive, a, copy, of, the, carrier, s, federal, operating, authority, freight, brokers, and, intermediaries, are, also, required, by, federal, law, to, be, licensed, by, the, federal, highway, administration, experienced, shippers, avoid, unlicensed, brokers, and, forwarders, because, if, brokers, are, working, outside, the, law, by, not, having, a, federal, operating, license, the, shipper, has, no, protection, in, case, of, a, problem, also, shippers, typically, ask, for, a, copy, of, the, broker, s, insurance, certificate, and, any, specific, insurance, that, applies, to, the, shipment, overall, shipping, costs, have, fallen, over, the, past, decades, a, further, drop, in, shipping, costs, in, the, future, might, be, realized, through, the, application, of, improved, 3d, printing, technologies, governments, are, very, concerned, with, cargo, shipment, as, it, may, bring, security, risks, to, a, country, therefore, many, governments, have, enacted, rules, and, regulations, administered, by, a, customs, agency, for, the, handling, of, cargo, to, minimize, risks, of, terrorism, and, other, crime, governments, are, mainly, concerned, with, cargo, entering, through, a, country, s, borders, the, united, states, has, been, one, of, the, leaders, in, securing, cargo, they, see, cargo, as, a, concern, to, national, security, after, the, terrorist, attacks, of, september, 11th, the, security, of, this, magnitude, of, cargo, has, become, highlighted, on, the, over, 6, million, cargo, containers, that, enter, the, united, states, ports, each, year, the, latest, us, government, response, to, this, threat, is, the, csi, container, security, initiative, csi, is, a, program, intended, to, help, increase, security, for, containerized, cargo, shipped, to, the, united, states, from, around, the, world, europe, is, also, focusing, on, this, issue, with, several, eu, funded, projects, underway, many, ways, and, materials, are, available, to, stabilize, and, secure, cargo, in, various, modes, of, transport, conventional, load, securing, methods, and, materials, such, as, steel, strapping, and, plastic, wood, blocking, and, bracing, have, been, used, for, decades, and, are, still, widely, used, present, load, securing, methods, offer, several, other, options, including, polyester, strapping, and, lashing, synthetic, webbings, and, dunnage, bags, also, known, as, airbags, or, inflatable, bags, practical, advice, on, stabilization, is, given, in, the, international, guidelines, on, safe, load, securing, for, road, transport
