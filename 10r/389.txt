a, pencil, p, n, s, l, is, a, writing, or, drawing, implement, with, a, solid, pigment, core, in, a, protective, casing, that, reduces, the, risk, of, core, breakage, and, keeps, it, from, marking, the, user, s, hand, pencils, create, marks, by, physical, abrasion, leaving, a, trail, of, solid, core, material, that, adheres, to, a, sheet, of, paper, or, other, surface, they, are, distinct, from, pens, which, dispense, liquid, or, gel, ink, onto, the, marked, surface, most, pencil, cores, are, made, of, graphite, powder, mixed, with, a, clay, binder, graphite, pencils, traditionally, known, as, lead, pencils, produce, grey, or, black, marks, that, are, easily, erased, but, otherwise, resistant, to, moisture, most, solvents, ultraviolet, radiation, and, natural, aging, other, types, of, pencil, cores, such, as, those, of, charcoal, are, mainly, used, for, drawing, and, sketching, coloured, pencils, are, sometimes, used, by, teachers, or, editors, to, correct, submitted, texts, but, are, typically, regarded, as, art, supplies, especially, those, with, cores, made, from, wax, based, binders, that, tend, to, smear, when, erasers, are, applied, to, them, grease, pencils, have, a, softer, oily, core, that, can, leave, marks, on, smooth, surfaces, such, as, glass, or, porcelain, the, most, common, pencil, casing, is, thin, wood, usually, hexagonal, in, section, but, sometimes, cylindrical, or, triangular, permanently, bonded, to, the, core, casings, may, be, of, other, materials, such, as, plastic, or, paper, to, use, the, pencil, the, casing, must, be, carved, or, peeled, off, to, expose, the, working, end, of, the, core, as, a, sharp, point, mechanical, pencils, have, more, elaborate, casings, which, are, not, bonded, to, the, core, instead, they, support, separate, mobile, pigment, cores, that, can, be, extended, or, retracted, usually, through, the, casing, s, tip, as, needed, these, casings, can, be, reloaded, with, new, cores, usually, graphite, as, the, previous, ones, are, exhausted, pencil, from, old, french, pincel, from, late, latin, penicillus, a, little, tail, see, penis, pincellus, originally, referred, to, an, artist, s, fine, brush, of, camel, hair, also, used, for, writing, before, modern, lead, or, chalk, pencils, though, the, archetypal, pencil, was, an, artist, s, brush, the, stylus, a, thin, metal, stick, used, for, scratching, in, papyrus, or, wax, tablets, was, used, extensively, by, the, romans, and, for, palm, leaf, manuscripts, as, a, technique, for, drawing, the, closest, predecessor, to, the, pencil, was, silverpoint, or, leadpoint, until, in, 1565, some, sources, say, as, early, as, 1500, a, large, deposit, of, graphite, was, discovered, on, the, approach, to, grey, knotts, from, the, hamlet, of, seathwaite, in, borrowdale, parish, cumbria, england, this, particular, deposit, of, graphite, was, extremely, pure, and, solid, and, it, could, easily, be, sawn, into, sticks, it, remains, the, only, large, scale, deposit, of, graphite, ever, found, in, this, solid, form, chemistry, was, in, its, infancy, and, the, substance, was, thought, to, be, a, form, of, lead, consequently, it, was, called, plumbago, latin, for, lead, ore, because, the, pencil, core, is, still, referred, to, as, lead, or, a, lead, many, people, have, the, misconception, that, the, graphite, in, the, pencil, is, lead, and, the, black, core, of, pencils, is, still, referred, to, as, lead, even, though, it, never, contained, the, element, lead, the, words, for, pencil, in, german, bleistift, irish, peann, luaidhe, arabic, qalam, ra, and, some, other, languages, literally, mean, lead, pen, the, value, of, graphite, would, soon, be, realised, to, be, enormous, mainly, because, it, could, be, used, to, line, the, moulds, for, cannonballs, the, mines, were, taken, over, by, the, crown, and, were, guarded, when, sufficient, stores, of, graphite, had, been, accumulated, the, mines, were, flooded, to, prevent, theft, until, more, was, required, the, usefulness, of, graphite, for, pencils, was, discovered, as, well, but, graphite, for, pencils, had, to, be, smuggled, because, graphite, is, soft, it, requires, some, form, of, encasement, graphite, sticks, were, initially, wrapped, in, string, or, sheepskin, for, stability, england, would, enjoy, a, monopoly, on, the, production, of, pencils, until, a, method, of, reconstituting, the, graphite, powder, was, found, in, 1662, in, germany, however, the, distinctively, square, english, pencils, continued, to, be, made, with, sticks, cut, from, natural, graphite, into, the, 1860s, the, town, of, keswick, near, the, original, findings, of, block, graphite, still, manufactures, pencils, the, factory, also, being, the, location, of, the, derwent, pencil, museum, the, meaning, of, graphite, writing, implement, apparently, evolved, late, in, the, 16th, century, around, 1560, an, italian, couple, named, simonio, and, lyndiana, bernacotti, made, what, are, likely, the, first, blueprints, for, the, modern, wood, encased, carpentry, pencil, their, version, was, a, flat, oval, more, compact, type, of, pencil, their, concept, involved, the, hollowing, out, of, a, stick, of, juniper, wood, shortly, thereafter, a, superior, technique, was, discovered, two, wooden, halves, were, carved, a, graphite, stick, inserted, and, the, halves, then, glued, together, essentially, the, same, method, in, use, to, this, day, the, first, attempt, to, manufacture, graphite, sticks, from, powdered, graphite, was, in, nuremberg, germany, in, 1662, it, used, a, mixture, of, graphite, sulphur, and, antimony, english, and, german, pencils, were, not, available, to, the, french, during, the, napoleonic, wars, france, under, naval, blockade, imposed, by, great, britain, was, unable, to, import, the, pure, graphite, sticks, from, the, british, grey, knotts, mines, the, only, known, source, in, the, world, france, was, also, unable, to, import, the, inferior, german, graphite, pencil, substitute, it, took, the, efforts, of, an, officer, in, napoleon, s, army, to, change, this, in, 1795, nicolas, jacques, cont, discovered, a, method, of, mixing, powdered, graphite, with, clay, and, forming, the, mixture, into, rods, that, were, then, fired, in, a, kiln, by, varying, the, ratio, of, graphite, to, clay, the, hardness, of, the, graphite, rod, could, also, be, varied, this, method, of, manufacture, which, had, been, earlier, discovered, by, the, austrian, joseph, hardtmuth, the, founder, of, the, koh, i, noor, in, 1790, remains, in, use, in, 1802, the, production, of, graphite, leads, from, graphite, and, clay, was, patented, by, the, koh, i, noor, company, in, vienna, in, england, pencils, continued, to, be, made, from, whole, sawn, graphite, henry, bessemer, s, first, successful, invention, 1838, was, a, method, of, compressing, graphite, powder, into, solid, graphite, thus, allowing, the, waste, from, sawing, to, be, reused, american, colonists, imported, pencils, from, europe, until, after, the, american, revolution, benjamin, franklin, advertised, pencils, for, sale, in, his, pennsylvania, gazette, in, 1729, and, george, washington, used, a, three, inch, 7, 5, cm, pencil, when, he, surveyed, the, ohio, country, in, 1762, william, munroe, a, cabinetmaker, in, concord, massachusetts, made, the, first, american, wood, pencils, in, 1812, this, was, not, the, only, pencil, making, occurring, in, concord, according, to, henry, petroski, transcendentalist, philosopher, henry, david, thoreau, discovered, how, to, make, a, good, pencil, out, of, inferior, graphite, using, clay, as, the, binder, this, invention, was, prompted, by, his, father, s, pencil, factory, in, concord, which, employed, graphite, found, in, new, hampshire, in, 1821, by, charles, dunbar, munroe, s, method, of, making, pencils, was, painstakingly, slow, and, in, the, neighbouring, town, of, acton, a, pencil, mill, owner, named, ebenezer, wood, set, out, to, automate, the, process, at, his, own, pencil, mill, located, at, nashoba, brook, he, used, the, first, circular, saw, in, pencil, production, he, constructed, the, first, of, the, hexagon, and, octagon, shaped, wooden, casings, ebenezer, did, not, patent, his, invention, and, shared, his, techniques, with, anyone, one, of, those, was, eberhard, faber, which, built, a, factory, in, new, york, and, became, the, leader, in, pencil, production, joseph, dixon, an, inventor, and, entrepreneur, involved, with, the, tantiusques, graphite, mine, in, sturbridge, massachusetts, developed, a, means, to, mass, produce, pencils, by, 1870, the, joseph, dixon, crucible, company, was, the, world, s, largest, dealer, and, consumer, of, graphite, and, later, became, the, contemporary, dixon, ticonderoga, pencil, and, art, supplies, company, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, over, 240, 000, pencils, were, used, each, day, in, the, us, the, favoured, timber, for, pencils, was, red, cedar, as, it, was, aromatic, and, did, not, splinter, when, sharpened, in, the, early, 20th, century, supplies, of, red, cedar, were, dwindling, so, that, pencil, manufacturers, were, forced, to, recycle, the, wood, from, cedar, fences, and, barns, to, maintain, supply, one, effect, of, this, was, that, during, world, war, ii, rotary, pencil, sharpeners, were, outlawed, in, britain, because, they, wasted, so, much, scarce, lead, and, wood, and, pencils, had, to, be, sharpened, in, the, more, conservative, manner, with, knives, it, was, soon, discovered, that, incense, cedar, when, dyed, and, perfumed, to, resemble, red, cedar, was, a, suitable, alternative, most, pencils, today, are, made, from, this, timber, which, is, grown, in, managed, forests, over, 14, billion, pencils, are, manufactured, worldwide, annually, less, popular, alternatives, to, cedar, include, basswood, and, alder, in, southeast, asia, the, wood, jelutong, may, be, used, to, create, pencils, though, the, use, of, this, rainforest, species, is, controversial, environmentalists, prefer, the, use, of, pulai, another, wood, native, to, the, region, in, pencil, manufacturing, on, march, 30, 1858, hymen, lipman, received, the, first, patent, for, attaching, an, eraser, to, the, end, of, a, pencil, in, 1862, lipman, sold, his, patent, to, joseph, reckendorfer, for, 100, 000, who, went, on, to, sue, pencil, manufacturer, faber, castell, for, infringement, in, reckendorfer, v, faber, 1875, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, ruled, against, reckendorfer, declaring, the, patent, invalid, historian, henry, petroski, notes, that, while, ever, more, efficient, means, of, mass, production, of, pencils, has, driven, the, replacement, cost, of, a, pencil, down, before, this, people, would, continue, to, use, even, the, stub, of, a, pencil, for, those, who, did, not, feel, comfortable, using, a, stub, pencil, extenders, were, sold, these, devices, function, something, like, a, porte, crayon, the, pencil, stub, can, be, inserted, into, the, end, of, a, shaft, extenders, were, especially, common, among, engineers, and, draftsmen, whose, favorite, pencils, were, priced, dearly, the, use, of, an, extender, also, has, the, advantage, that, the, pencil, does, not, appreciably, change, its, heft, as, it, wears, down, artists, use, extenders, to, maximize, the, use, of, their, colored, pencils, graphite, pencils, are, the, most, common, types, of, pencil, and, are, encased, in, wood, they, are, made, of, a, mixture, of, clay, and, graphite, and, their, darkness, varies, from, light, grey, to, black, their, composition, allows, for, the, smoothest, strokes, solid, graphite, pencils, are, solid, sticks, of, graphite, and, clay, composite, as, found, in, a, graphite, pencil, about, the, diameter, of, a, common, pencil, which, have, no, casing, other, than, a, wrapper, or, label, they, are, often, called, woodless, pencils, they, are, used, primarily, for, art, purposes, as, the, lack, of, casing, allows, for, covering, larger, spaces, more, easily, creating, different, effects, and, providing, greater, economy, as, the, entirety, of, the, pencil, is, used, they, are, available, in, the, same, darkness, range, as, wood, encased, graphite, pencils, liquid, graphite, pencils, are, pencils, that, write, like, pens, the, technology, was, first, invented, in, 1955, by, scripto, and, parker, pens, scripto, s, liquid, graphite, formula, came, out, about, three, months, before, parker, s, liquid, lead, formula, to, avoid, a, lengthy, patent, fight, the, two, companies, agreed, to, share, their, formulas, charcoal, pencils, are, made, of, charcoal, and, provide, fuller, blacks, than, graphite, pencils, but, tend, to, smudge, easily, and, are, more, abrasive, than, graphite, sepia, toned, and, white, pencils, are, also, available, for, duotone, techniques, carbon, pencils, are, generally, made, of, a, mixture, of, clay, and, lamp, black, but, are, sometimes, blended, with, charcoal, or, graphite, depending, on, the, darkness, and, manufacturer, they, produce, a, fuller, black, than, graphite, pencils, are, smoother, than, charcoal, and, have, minimal, dust, and, smudging, they, also, blend, very, well, much, like, charcoal, colored, pencils, or, pencil, crayons, have, wax, like, cores, with, pigment, and, other, fillers, several, colors, are, sometimes, blended, together, grease, pencils, can, write, on, virtually, any, surface, including, glass, plastic, metal, and, photographs, the, most, commonly, found, grease, pencils, are, encased, in, paper, berol, and, sanford, peel, off, but, they, can, also, be, encased, in, wood, staedtler, omnichrom, watercolor, pencils, are, designed, for, use, with, watercolor, techniques, their, cores, can, be, diluted, by, water, the, pencils, can, be, used, by, themselves, for, sharp, bold, lines, strokes, made, by, the, pencil, can, also, be, saturated, with, water, and, spread, with, brushes, carpenter, s, pencils, are, pencils, that, have, two, main, properties, their, shape, prevents, them, from, rolling, and, their, graphite, is, strong, the, oldest, surviving, pencil, is, a, german, carpenter, s, pencil, dating, from, the, 17th, century, and, now, in, the, faber, castell, collection, copying, pencils, or, indelible, pencils, are, graphite, pencils, with, an, added, dye, that, creates, an, indelible, mark, they, were, invented, in, the, late, 19th, century, for, press, copying, and, as, a, practical, substitute, for, fountain, pens, their, markings, are, often, visually, indistinguishable, from, those, of, standard, graphite, pencils, but, when, moistened, their, markings, dissolve, into, a, coloured, ink, which, is, then, pressed, into, another, piece, of, paper, they, were, widely, used, until, the, mid, 20th, century, when, ball, pens, slowly, replaced, them, in, italy, their, use, is, still, mandated, by, law, for, voting, paper, ballots, in, elections, and, referendums, eye, liner, pencils, are, used, for, make, up, unlike, traditional, copying, pencils, eyeliner, pencils, usually, contain, non, toxic, dyes, unlike, wax, based, colored, pencils, the, erasable, variants, can, be, easily, erased, their, main, use, is, in, sketching, where, the, objective, is, to, create, an, outline, using, the, same, color, that, other, media, such, as, wax, pencils, or, watercolor, paints, would, fill, or, when, the, objective, is, to, scan, the, color, sketch, some, animators, prefer, erasable, color, pencils, as, opposed, to, graphite, pencils, because, they, do, not, smudge, as, easily, and, the, different, colors, allow, for, better, separation, of, objects, in, the, sketch, copy, editors, find, them, useful, too, as, markings, stand, out, more, than, those, of, graphite, but, can, be, erased, also, known, as, non, photo, blue, pencils, the, non, reproducing, types, make, marks, that, are, not, reproducible, by, photocopiers, examples, include, copy, not, by, sanford, and, mars, non, photo, by, staedtler, or, by, whiteprint, copiers, such, as, mars, non, print, by, staedtler, stenographer, s, pencils, also, known, as, a, steno, pencil, are, expected, to, be, very, reliable, and, their, lead, is, break, proof, nevertheless, steno, pencils, are, sometimes, sharpened, at, both, ends, to, enhance, reliability, they, are, round, to, avoid, pressure, pain, during, long, texts, golf, pencils, are, usually, short, a, common, length, is, 9, cm, or, 3, 5, in, and, very, cheap, they, are, also, known, as, library, pencils, as, many, libraries, offer, them, as, disposable, writing, instruments, a, standard, hexagonal, 2, pencil, is, cut, to, a, hexagonal, height, of, 6, mm, 1, 4, in, but, the, outer, diameter, is, slightly, larger, about, 7, mm, or, 9, 32, in, a, standard, 2, hexagonal, pencil, is, 19, cm, 7, 5, in, long, on, 3, september, 2007, ashrita, furman, unveiled, his, giant, us, 20, 000, pencil, 23, metres, 76, ft, long, 8, 200, kilograms, 18, 000, lb, with, over, 2, 000, kilograms, 4, 500, lb, for, the, graphite, centre, after, three, weeks, of, creation, in, august, 2007, as, a, birthday, gift, for, teacher, sri, chinmoy, it, is, longer, than, the, 20, metre, 65, ft, pencil, outside, the, malaysia, hq, of, stationers, faber, castell, mechanical, pencils, use, mechanical, methods, to, push, lead, through, a, hole, at, the, end, these, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, with, propelling, pencils, an, internal, mechanism, is, employed, to, push, the, lead, out, from, an, internal, compartment, while, clutch, pencils, merely, hold, the, lead, in, place, the, lead, is, extended, by, releasing, it, and, allowing, some, external, force, usually, gravity, to, pull, it, out, of, the, body, the, erasers, sometimes, replaced, by, a, sharpener, on, pencils, with, larger, lead, sizes, are, also, removable, and, thus, replaceable, and, usually, cover, a, place, to, store, replacement, leads, mechanical, pencils, are, popular, for, their, longevity, and, the, fact, that, they, may, never, need, sharpening, lead, types, are, based, on, grade, and, size, with, standard, sizes, being, 2, 00, mm, 0, 079, in, 1, 40, mm, 0, 055, in, 1, 00, mm, 0, 039, in, 0, 70, mm, 0, 028, in, 0, 50, mm, 0, 020, in, 0, 35, mm, 0,

pioneered, by, taiwanese, stationery, manufacturer, bensia, pioneer, industrial, corporation, in, the, early, 1970s, pop, a, point, pencils, are, also, known, as, bensia, pencils, stackable, pencils, or, non, sharpening, pencils, it, is, a, type, of, pencil, where, many, short, pencil, tips, are, housed, in, a, cartridge, style, plastic, holder, a, blunt, tip, is, removed, by, pulling, it, from, the, writing, end, of, the, body, and, re, inserting, it, into, the, open, ended, bottom, of, the, body, thereby, pushing, a, new, tip, to, the, top, invented, by, harold, grossman, for, the, empire, pencil, company, in, 1967, plastic, pencils, were, subsequently, improved, upon, by, arthur, d, little, for, empire, from, 1969, through, the, early, 1970s, the, plastic, pencil, was, commercialised, by, empire, as, the, epcon, pencil, these, pencils, were, co, extruded, extruding, a, plasticised, graphite, mix, within, a, wood, composite, core, residual, graphite, from, a, pencil, stick, is, not, poisonous, and, graphite, is, harmless, if, consumed, although, lead, has, not, been, used, for, writing, since, antiquity, such, as, in, roman, styli, lead, poisoning, from, pencils, was, not, uncommon, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, the, paint, used, for, the, outer, coating, could, contain, high, concentrations, of, lead, and, this, could, be, ingested, when, the, pencil, was, sucked, or, chewed, the, lead, of, the, pencil, is, a, mix, of, finely, ground, graphite, and, clay, powders, before, the, two, substances, are, mixed, they, are, separately, cleaned, of, foreign, matter, and, dried, in, a, manner, that, creates, large, square, cakes, once, the, cakes, have, fully, dried, the, graphite, and, the, clay, squares, are, mixed, together, using, water, the, amount, of, clay, content, added, to, the, graphite, depends, on, the, intended, pencil, hardness, lower, proportions, of, clay, makes, the, core, softer, and, the, amount, of, time, spent, on, grinding, the, mixture, determines, the, quality, of, the, lead, the, mixture, is, then, shaped, into, long, spaghetti, like, strings, straightened, dried, cut, and, then, tempered, in, a, kiln, the, resulting, strings, are, dipped, in, oil, or, molten, wax, which, seeps, into, the, tiny, holes, of, the, material, and, allows, for, the, smooth, writing, ability, of, the, pencil, a, juniper, or, incense, cedar, plank, with, several, long, parallel, grooves, is, cut, to, fashion, a, slat, and, the, graphite, clay, strings, are, inserted, into, the, grooves, another, grooved, plank, is, glued, on, top, and, the, whole, assembly, is, then, cut, into, individual, pencils, which, are, then, varnished, or, painted, many, pencils, feature, an, eraser, on, the, top, and, so, the, process, is, usually, still, considered, incomplete, at, this, point, each, pencil, has, a, shoulder, cut, on, one, end, of, the, pencil, to, allow, for, a, metal, ferrule, to, be, secured, onto, the, wood, a, rubber, plug, is, then, inserted, into, the, ferrule, for, a, functioning, eraser, on, the, end, of, the, pencil, graphite, pencils, are, made, of, a, mixture, of, clay, and, graphite, and, their, darkness, varies, from, black, to, light, grey, a, higher, amount, of, clay, added, to, the, pencil, makes, it, harder, leaving, lighter, marks, there, is, a, wide, range, of, grades, available, mainly, for, artists, who, are, interested, in, creating, a, full, range, of, tones, from, light, grey, to, black, engineers, prefer, harder, pencils, which, allow, for, a, greater, control, in, the, shape, of, the, lead, manufacturers, distinguish, their, pencils, by, grading, them, but, there, is, no, common, standard, two, pencils, of, the, same, grade, but, different, manufacturers, will, not, necessarily, make, a, mark, of, identical, tone, nor, have, the, same, hardness, most, manufacturers, and, almost, all, in, europe, designate, their, pencils, with, the, letters, h, commonly, interpreted, as, hardness, to, b, commonly, blackness, as, well, as, f, usually, taken, to, mean, fineness, although, f, pencils, are, no, more, fine, or, more, easily, sharpened, than, any, other, grade, also, referred, as, firm, by, many, manufacturers, the, standard, writing, pencil, is, graded, hb, this, designation, in, the, form, h, b, was, in, use, at, least, as, early, as, 1814, softer, or, harder, pencil, grades, were, described, by, a, sequence, or, successive, bs, or, hs, such, as, bb, and, bbb, for, successively, softer, leads, and, hh, and, hhh, for, successively, harder, ones, the, koh, i, noor, hardtmuth, pencil, manufacturers, claim, to, have, first, used, the, hb, designations, with, h, standing, for, hardtmuth, b, for, the, company, s, location, of, bud, jovice, and, f, for, franz, hardtmuth, who, was, responsible, for, technological, improvements, in, pencil, manufacture, as, of, 2021, a, set, of, pencils, ranging, from, a, very, soft, black, marking, pencil, to, a, very, hard, light, marking, pencil, usually, ranges, from, softest, to, hardest, as, follows, koh, i, noor, offers, twenty, grades, from, 10h, to, 8b, for, its, 1500, series, mitsubishi, pencil, offers, twenty, two, grades, from, 10h, to, 10b, for, its, hi, uni, range, derwent, produces, twenty, grades, from, 9h, to, 9b, for, its, graphic, pencils, staedtler, produces, 24, from, 10h, to, 12b, for, its, mars, lumograph, pencils, numbers, as, designation, were, first, used, by, cont, and, later, by, john, thoreau, father, of, henry, david, thoreau, in, the, 19th, century, although, cont, thoreau, s, equivalence, table, is, widely, accepted, not, all, manufacturers, follow, it, for, example, faber, castell, uses, a, different, equivalence, table, in, its, grip, 2001, pencils, 1, 2b, 2, b, 2, hb, 3, h, 4, 2h, graded, pencils, can, be, used, for, a, rapid, test, that, provides, relative, ratings, for, a, series, of, coated, panels, but, cannot, be, used, to, compare, the, pencil, hardness, of, different, coatings, this, test, defines, a, pencil, hardness, of, a, coating, as, the, grade, of, the, hardest, pencil, that, does, not, permanently, mark, the, coating, when, pressed,
