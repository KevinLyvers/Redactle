https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter
a, helicopter, is, a, type, of, rotorcraft, in, which, lift, and, thrust, are, supplied, by, horizontally, spinning, rotors, this, allows, the, helicopter, to, take, off, and, land, vertically, to, hover, and, to, fly, forward, backward, and, laterally, these, attributes, allow, helicopters, to, be, used, in, congested, or, isolated, areas, where, fixed, wing, aircraft, and, many, forms, of, short, take, off, and, landing, stol, or, short, take, off, and, vertical, landing, stovl, aircraft, cannot, perform, without, a, runway, in, 1942, the, sikorsky, r, 4, became, the, first, helicopter, to, reach, full, scale, production, although, most, earlier, designs, used, more, than, one, main, rotor, the, configuration, of, a, single, main, rotor, accompanied, by, a, vertical, anti, torque, tail, rotor, i, e, unicopter, not, to, be, confused, with, the, single, blade, monocopter, has, become, the, most, common, helicopter, configuration, however, twin, main, rotor, helicopters, bicopters, in, either, tandem, or, transverse, rotors, configurations, are, sometimes, in, use, due, to, their, greater, payload, capacity, than, the, monorotor, design, and, coaxial, rotor, tiltrotor, and, compound, helicopters, are, also, all, flying, today, quadrotor, helicopters, quadcopters, were, pioneered, as, early, as, 1907, in, france, and, along, with, other, types, of, multicopters, have, been, developed, mainly, for, specialized, applications, such, as, drones, the, english, word, helicopter, is, adapted, from, the, french, word, h, licopt, re, coined, by, gustave, ponton, d, am, court, in, 1861, which, originates, from, the, greek, helix, genitive, helikos, helix, spiral, whirl, convolution, and, pteron, wing, in, a, process, of, rebracketing, the, word, is, often, erroneously, from, an, etymological, point, of, view, perceived, by, english, speakers, as, consisting, of, heli, and, copter, leading, to, words, like, helipad, and, quadcopter, english, language, nicknames, for, helicopter, include, chopper, copter, heli, and, whirlybird, in, the, united, states, military, the, common, slang, is, helo, pronounced, with, a, long, e, a, helicopter, is, a, type, of, rotorcraft, in, which, lift, and, thrust, are, supplied, by, one, or, more, horizontally, spinning, rotors, by, contrast, the, autogyro, or, gyroplane, and, gyrodyne, have, a, free, spinning, rotor, for, all, or, part, of, the, flight, envelope, relying, on, a, separate, thrust, system, to, propel, the, craft, forwards, so, that, the, airflow, sets, the, rotor, spinning, to, provide, lift, the, compound, helicopter, also, has, a, separate, thrust, system, but, continues, to, supply, power, to, the, rotor, throughout, normal, flight, the, rotor, system, or, more, simply, rotor, is, the, rotating, part, of, a, helicopter, that, generates, lift, a, rotor, system, may, be, mounted, horizontally, as, main, rotors, are, providing, lift, vertically, or, it, may, be, mounted, vertically, such, as, a, tail, rotor, to, provide, horizontal, thrust, to, counteract, torque, from, the, main, rotors, the, rotor, consists, of, a, mast, hub, and, rotor, blades, the, mast, is, a, cylindrical, metal, shaft, that, extends, upwards, from, the, transmission, at, the, top, of, the, mast, is, the, attachment, point, for, the, rotor, blades, called, the, hub, main, rotor, systems, are, classified, according, to, how, the, rotor, blades, are, attached, and, move, relative, to, the, hub, there, are, three, basic, types, hingeless, fully, articulated, and, teetering, although, some, modern, rotor, systems, use, a, combination, of, these, most, helicopters, have, a, single, main, rotor, but, torque, created, by, its, aerodynamic, drag, must, be, countered, by, an, opposed, torque, the, design, that, igor, sikorsky, settled, on, for, his, vs, 300, was, a, smaller, tail, rotor, the, tail, rotor, pushes, or, pulls, against, the, tail, to, counter, the, torque, effect, and, this, has, become, the, most, common, configuration, for, helicopter, design, usually, at, the, end, of, a, tail, boom, some, helicopters, use, other, anti, torque, controls, instead, of, the, tail, rotor, such, as, the, ducted, fan, called, fenestron, or, fantail, and, notar, notar, provides, anti, torque, similar, to, the, way, a, wing, develops, lift, through, the, use, of, the, coand, effect, on, the, tail, boom, the, use, of, two, or, more, horizontal, rotors, turning, in, opposite, directions, is, another, configuration, used, to, counteract, the, effects, of, torque, on, the, aircraft, without, relying, on, an, anti, torque, tail, rotor, this, allows, the, power, normally, required, to, be, diverted, for, the, tail, rotor, to, be, applied, fully, to, the, main, rotors, increasing, the, aircraft, s, power, efficiency, and, lifting, capacity, there, are, several, common, configurations, that, use, the, counter, rotating, effect, to, benefit, the, rotorcraft, tip, jet, designs, let, the, rotor, push, itself, through, the, air, and, avoid, generating, torque, the, number, size, and, type, of, engine, s, used, on, a, helicopter, determines, the, size, function, and, capability, of, that, helicopter, design, the, earliest, helicopter, engines, were, simple, mechanical, devices, such, as, rubber, bands, or, spindles, which, relegated, the, size, of, helicopters, to, toys, and, small, models, for, a, half, century, before, the, first, airplane, flight, steam, engines, were, used, to, forward, the, development, of, the, understanding, of, helicopter, aerodynamics, but, the, limited, power, did, not, allow, for, manned, flight, the, introduction, of, the, internal, combustion, engine, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, became, the, watershed, for, helicopter, development, as, engines, began, to, be, developed, and, produced, that, were, powerful, enough, to, allow, for, helicopters, able, to, lift, humans, early, helicopter, designs, utilized, custom, built, engines, or, rotary, engines, designed, for, airplanes, but, these, were, soon, replaced, by, more, powerful, automobile, engines, and, radial, engines, the, single, most, limiting, factor, of, helicopter, development, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, was, that, the, amount, of, power, produced, by, an, engine, was, not, able, to, overcome, the, engine, s, weight, in, vertical, flight, this, was, overcome, in, early, successful, helicopters, by, using, the, smallest, engines, available, when, the, compact, flat, engine, was, developed, the, helicopter, industry, found, a, lighter, weight, powerplant, easily, adapted, to, small, helicopters, although, radial, engines, continued, to, be, used, for, larger, helicopters, turbine, engines, revolutionized, the, aviation, industry, and, the, turboshaft, engine, for, helicopter, use, pioneered, in, december, 1951, by, the, aforementioned, kaman, k, 225, finally, gave, helicopters, an, engine, with, a, large, amount, of, power, and, a, low, weight, penalty, turboshafts, are, also, more, reliable, than, piston, engines, especially, when, producing, the, sustained, high, levels, of, power, required, by, a, helicopter, the, turboshaft, engine, was, able, to, be, scaled, to, the, size, of, the, helicopter, being, designed, so, that, all, but, the, lightest, of, helicopter, models, are, powered, by, turbine, engines, today, special, jet, engines, developed, to, drive, the, rotor, from, the, rotor, tips, are, referred, to, as, tip, jets, tip, jets, powered, by, a, remote, compressor, are, referred, to, as, cold, tip, jets, while, those, powered, by, combustion, exhaust, are, referred, to, as, hot, tip, jets, an, example, of, a, cold, jet, helicopter, is, the, sud, ouest, djinn, and, an, example, of, the, hot, tip, jet, helicopter, is, the, yh, 32, hornet, some, radio, controlled, helicopters, and, smaller, helicopter, type, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, use, electric, motors, or, motorcycle, engines, radio, controlled, helicopters, may, also, have, piston, engines, that, use, fuels, other, than, gasoline, such, as, nitromethane, some, turbine, engines, commonly, used, in, helicopters, can, also, use, biodiesel, instead, of, jet, fuel, there, are, also, human, powered, helicopters, a, helicopter, has, four, flight, control, inputs, these, are, the, cyclic, the, collective, the, anti, torque, pedals, and, the, throttle, the, cyclic, control, is, usually, located, between, the, pilot, s, legs, and, is, commonly, called, the, cyclic, stick, or, just, cyclic, on, most, helicopters, the, cyclic, is, similar, to, a, joystick, however, the, robinson, r22, and, robinson, r44, have, a, unique, teetering, bar, cyclic, control, system, and, a, few, helicopters, have, a, cyclic, control, that, descends, into, the, cockpit, from, overhead, the, control, is, called, the, cyclic, because, it, changes, cyclic, pitch, of, the, main, blades, the, result, is, to, tilt, the, rotor, disk, in, a, particular, direction, resulting, in, the, helicopter, moving, in, that, direction, if, the, pilot, pushes, the, cyclic, forward, the, rotor, disk, tilts, forward, and, the, rotor, produces, a, thrust, in, the, forward, direction, if, the, pilot, pushes, the, cyclic, to, the, side, the, rotor, disk, tilts, to, that, side, and, produces, thrust, in, that, direction, causing, the, helicopter, to, hover, sideways, the, collective, pitch, control, or, collective, is, located, on, the, left, side, of, the, pilot, s, seat, with, a, settable, friction, control, to, prevent, inadvertent, movement, the, collective, changes, the, pitch, angle, of, all, the, main, rotor, blades, collectively, i, e, all, at, the, same, time, and, independently, of, their, position, therefore, if, a, collective, input, is, made, all, the, blades, change, equally, and, the, result, is, the, helicopter, increasing, or, decreasing, in, altitude, a, swashplate, controls, the, collective, and, cyclic, pitch, of, the, main, blades, the, swashplate, moves, up, and, down, along, the, main, shaft, to, change, the, pitch, of, both, blades, this, causes, the, helicopter, to, push, air, downward, or, upward, depending, on, the, angle, of, attack, the, swashplate, can, also, change, its, angle, to, move, the, blades, angle, forwards, or, backwards, or, left, and, right, to, make, the, helicopter, move, in, those, directions, the, anti, torque, pedals, are, located, in, the, same, position, as, the, rudder, pedals, in, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, and, serve, a, similar, purpose, namely, to, control, the, direction, in, which, the, nose, of, the, aircraft, is, pointed, application, of, the, pedal, in, a, given, direction, changes, the, pitch, of, the, tail, rotor, blades, increasing, or, reducing, the, thrust, produced, by, the, tail, rotor, and, causing, the, nose, to, yaw, in, the, direction, of, the, applied, pedal, the, pedals, mechanically, change, the, pitch, of, the, tail, rotor, altering, the, amount, of, thrust, produced, helicopter, rotors, are, designed, to, operate, in, a, narrow, range, of, rpm, the, throttle, controls, the, power, produced, by, the, engine, which, is, connected, to, the, rotor, by, a, fixed, ratio, transmission, the, purpose, of, the, throttle, is, to, maintain, enough, engine, power, to, keep, the, rotor, rpm, within, allowable, limits, so, that, the, rotor, produces, enough, lift, for, flight, in, single, engine, helicopters, the, throttle, control, is, a, motorcycle, style, twist, grip, mounted, on, the, collective, control, while, dual, engine, helicopters, have, a, power, lever, for, each, engine, a, compound, helicopter, has, an, additional, system, for, thrust, and, typically, small, stub, fixed, wings, this, offloads, the, rotor, in, cruise, which, allows, its, rotation, to, be, slowed, down, thus, increasing, the, maximum, speed, of, the, aircraft, the, lockheed, ah, 56a, cheyenne, diverted, up, to, 90, of, its, engine, power, to, a, pusher, propeller, during, forward, flight, there, are, three, basic, flight, conditions, for, a, helicopter, hover, forward, flight, and, the, transition, between, the, two, hovering, is, the, most, challenging, part, of, flying, a, helicopter, this, is, because, a, helicopter, generates, its, own, gusty, air, while, in, a, hover, which, acts, against, the, fuselage, and, flight, control, surfaces, the, result, is, constant, control, inputs, and, corrections, by, the, pilot, to, keep, the, helicopter, where, it, is, required, to, be, despite, the, complexity, of, the, task, the, control, inputs, in, a, hover, are, simple, the, cyclic, is, used, to, eliminate, drift, in, the, horizontal, plane, that, is, to, control, forward, and, back, right, and, left, the, collective, is, used, to, maintain, altitude, the, pedals, are, used, to, control, nose, direction, or, heading, it, is, the, interaction, of, these, controls, that, makes, hovering, so, difficult, since, an, adjustment, in, any, one, control, requires, an, adjustment, of, the, other, two, creating, a, cycle, of, constant, correction, as, a, helicopter, moves, from, hover, to, forward, flight, it, enters, a, state, called, translational, lift, which, provides, extra, lift, without, increasing, power, this, state, most, typically, occurs, when, the, airspeed, reaches, approximately, 16, 24, knots, 30, 44, km, h, 18, 28, mph, and, may, be, necessary, for, a, helicopter, to, obtain, flight, in, forward, flight, a, helicopter, s, flight, controls, behave, more, like, those, of, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, applying, forward, pressure, on, the, cyclic, will, cause, the, nose, to, pitch, down, with, a, resultant, increase, in, airspeed, and, loss, of, altitude, aft, cyclic, will, cause, the, nose, to, pitch, up, slowing, the, helicopter, and, causing, it, to, climb, increasing, collective, power, while, maintaining, a, constant, airspeed, will, induce, a, climb, while, decreasing, collective, will, cause, a, descent, coordinating, these, two, inputs, down, collective, plus, aft, cyclic, or, up, collective, plus, forward, cyclic, will, result, in, airspeed, changes, while, maintaining, a, constant, altitude, the, pedals, serve, the, same, function, in, both, a, helicopter, and, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, to, maintain, balanced, flight, this, is, done, by, applying, a, pedal, input, in, whichever, direction, is, necessary, to, center, the, ball, in, the, turn, and, bank, indicator, due, to, the, operating, characteristics, of, the, helicopter, its, ability, to, take, off, and, land, vertically, and, to, hover, for, extended, periods, of, time, as, well, as, the, aircraft, s, handling, properties, under, low, airspeed, conditions, it, has, proved, advantageous, to, conduct, tasks, that, were, previously, not, possible, with, other, aircraft, or, were, time, or, work, intensive, to, accomplish, on, the, ground, today, helicopter, uses, include, transportation, of, people, and, cargo, military, uses, construction, firefighting, search, and, rescue, tourism, medical, transport, law, enforcement, agriculture, news, and, media, and, aerial, observation, among, others, a, helicopter, used, to, carry, loads, connected, to, long, cables, or, slings, is, called, an, aerial, crane, aerial, cranes, are, used, to, place, heavy, equipment, like, radio, transmission, towers, and, large, air, conditioning, units, on, the, tops, of, tall, buildings, or, when, an, item, must, be, raised, up, in, a, remote, area, such, as, a, radio, tower, raised, on, the, top, of, a, hill, or, mountain, helicopters, are, used, as, aerial, cranes, in, the, logging, industry, to, lift, trees, out, of, terrain, where, vehicles, cannot, travel, and, where, environmental, concerns, prohibit, the, building, of, roads, these, operations, are, referred, to, as, longline, because, of, the, long, single, sling, line, used, to, carry, the, load, in, military, service, helicopters, are, often, useful, for, delivery, of, outsized, slung, loads, that, would, not, fit, inside, ordinary, cargo, aircraft, artillery, pieces, large, machinery, field, radars, communications, gear, electrical, generators, or, pallets, of, bulk, cargo, in, military, operations, these, payloads, are, often, delivered, to, remote, locations, made, inaccessible, by, mountainous, or, riverine, terrain, or, naval, vessels, at, sea, in, electronic, news, gathering, helicopters, have, provided, aerial, views, of, some, major, news, stories, and, have, been, doing, so, from, the, late, 1960s, helicopters, have, also, been, used, in, films, both, in, front, and, behind, the, camera, the, largest, single, non, combat, helicopter, operation, in, history, was, the, disaster, management, operation, following, the, 1986, chernobyl, nuclear, disaster, hundreds, of, pilots, were, involved, in, airdrop, and, observation, missions, making, dozens, of, sorties, a, day, for, several, months, helitack, is, the, use, of, helicopters, to, combat, wildland, fires, the, helicopters, are, used, for, aerial, firefighting, water, bombing, and, may, be, fitted, with, tanks, or, carry, helibuckets, helibuckets, such, as, the, bambi, bucket, are, usually, filled, by, submerging, the, bucket, into, lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or, portable, tanks, tanks, fitted, onto, helicopters, are, filled, from, a, hose, while, the, helicopter, is, on, the, ground, or, water, is, siphoned, from, lakes, or, reservoirs, through, a, hanging, snorkel, as, the, helicopter, hovers, over, the, water, source, helitack, helicopters, are, also, used, to, deliver, firefighters, who, rappel, down, to, inaccessible, areas, and, to, resupply, firefighters, common, firefighting, helicopters, include, variants, of, the, bell, 205, and, the, erickson, s, 64, aircrane, helitanker, helicopters, are, used, as, air, ambulances, for, emergency, medical, assistance, in, situations, when, an, ambulance, cannot, easily, or, quickly, reach, the, scene, or, cannot, transport, the, patient, to, a, medical, facility, in, time, helicopters, are, also, used, when, patients, need, to, be, transported, between, medical, facilities, and, air, transportation, is, the, most, practical, method, an, air, ambulance, helicopter, is, equipped, to, stabilize, and, provide, limited, medical, treatment, to, a, patient, while, in, flight, the, use, of, helicopters, as, air, ambulances, is, often, referred, to, as, medevac, and, patients, are, referred, to, as, being, airlifted, or, medevaced, this, use, was, pioneered, in, the, korean, war, when, time, to, reach, a, medical, facility, was, reduced, to, three, hours, from, the, eight, hours, needed, in, world, war, ii, and, further, reduced, to, two, hours, by, the, vietnam, war, in, naval, service, a, prime, function, of, rescue, helicopters, is, to, promptly, retrieve, downed, aircrew, involved, in, crashes, occurring, upon, launch, or, recovery, aboard, aircraft, carriers, in, past, years, this, function, was, performed, by, destroyers, escorting, the, carrier, but, since, then, helicopters, have, proved, vastly, more, effective, police, departments, and, other, law, enforcement, agencies, use, helicopters, to, pursue, suspects, and, patrol, the, skies, since, helicopters, can, achieve, a, unique, aerial, view, they, are, often, used, in, conjunction, with, police, on, the, ground, to, report, on, suspects, locations, and, movements, they, are, often, mounted, with, lighting, and, heat, sensing, equipment, for, night, pursuits, military, forces, use, attack, helicopters, to, conduct, aerial, attacks, on, ground, targets, such, helicopters, are, mounted, with, missile, launchers, and, miniguns, transport, helicopters, are, used, to, ferry, troops, and, supplies, where, the, lack, of, an, airstrip, would, make, transport, via, fixed, wing, aircraft, impossible, the, use, of, transport, helicopters, to, deliver, troops, as, an, attack, force, on, an, objective, is, referred, to, as, air, assault, unmanned, aerial, systems, uas, helicopter, systems, of, varying, sizes, are, developed, by, companies, for, military, reconnaissance, and, surveillance, duties, naval, forces, also, use, helicopters, equipped, with, dipping, sonar, for, anti, submarine, warfare, since, they, can, operate, from, small, ships, oil, companies, charter, helicopters, to, move, workers, and, parts, quickly, to, remote, drilling, sites, located, at, sea, or, in, remote, locations, the, speed, advantage, over, boats, makes, the, high, operating, cost, of, helicopters, cost, effective, in, ensuring, that, oil, platforms, continue, to, operate, various, companies, specialize, in, this, type, of, operation, nasa, developed, ingenuity, a, 1, 8, kg, 4, 0, lb, helicopter, used, to, survey, mars, along, with, a, rover, it, began, service, in, february, 2021, and, was, retired, due, to, sustained, rotor, blade, damage, in, january, 2024, after, 73, sorties, as, the, martian, atmosphere, is, 100, times, thinner, than, earth, s, its, two, blades, spin, at, close, to, 3, 000, revolutions, a, minute, approximately, 10, times, faster, than, that, of, a, terrestrial, helicopter, in, 2017, 926, civil, helicopters, were, shipped, for, 3, 68, billion, led, by, airbus, helicopters, with, 1, 87, billion, for, 369, rotorcraft, leonardo, helicopters, with, 806, million, for, 102, first, three, quarters, only, bell, helicopter, with, 696, million, for, 132, then, robinson, helicopter, with, 161, million, for, 305, by, october, 2018, the, in, service, and, stored, helicopter, fleet, of, 38, 570, with, civil, or, government, operators, was, led, robinson, helicopter, with, 24, 7, followed, by, airbus, helicopters, with, 24, 4, then, bell, with, 20, 5, and, leonardo, with, 8, 4, russian, helicopters, with, 7, 7, sikorsky, aircraft, with, 7, 2, md, helicopters, with, 3, 4, and, other, with, 2, 2, the, most, widespread, model, is, the, piston, robinson, r44, with, 5, 600, then, the, h125, as350, with, 3, 600, units, followed, by, the, bell, 206, with, 3, 400, most, were, in, north, america, with, 34, 3, then, in, europe, with, 28, 0, followed, by, asia, pacific, with, 18, 6, latin, america, with, 11, 6, africa, with, 5, 3, and, middle, east, with, 1, 7, the, earliest, references, for, vertical, flight, came, from, china, since, around, 400, bc, chinese, children, have, played, with, bamboo, flying, toys, or, chinese, top, this, bamboo, copter, is, spun, by, rolling, a, stick, attached, to, a, rotor, the, spinning, creates, lift, and, the, toy, flies, when, released, the, 4th, century, ad, daoist, book, baopuzi, by, ge, hong, master, who, embraces, simplicity, reportedly, describes, some, of, the, ideas, inherent, to, rotary, wing, aircraft, designs, similar, to, the, chinese, helicopter, toy, appeared, in, some, renaissance, paintings, and, other, works, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, western, scientists, developed, flying, machines, based, on, the, chinese, toy, it, was, not, until, the, early, 1480s, when, italian, polymath, leonardo, da, vinci, created, a, design, for, a, machine, that, could, be, described, as, an, aerial, screw, that, any, recorded, advancement, was, made, towards, vertical, flight, his, notes, suggested, that, he, built, small, flying, models, but, there, were, no, indications, for, any, provision, to, stop, the, rotor, from, making, the, craft, rotate, as, scientific, knowledge, increased, and, became, more, accepted, people, continued, to, pursue, the, idea, of, vertical, flight, in, july, 1754, russian, mikhail, lomonosov, had, developed, a, small, coaxial, modeled, after, the, chinese, top, but, powered, by, a, wound, up, spring, device, and, demonstrated, it, to, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, it, was, powered, by, a, spring, and, was, suggested, as, a, method, to, lift, meteorological, instruments, in, 1783, christian, de, launoy, and, his, mechanic, bienvenu, used, a, coaxial, version, of, the, chinese, top, in, a, model, consisting, of, contrarotating, turkey, flight, feathers, as, rotor, blades, and, in, 1784, demonstrated, it, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, sir, george, cayley, influenced, by, a, childhood, fascination, with, the, chinese, flying, top, developed, a, model, of, feathers, similar, to, that, of, launoy, and, bienvenu, but, powered, by, rubber, bands, by, the, end, of, the, century, he, had, progressed, to, using, sheets, of, tin, for, rotor, blades, and, springs, for, power, his, writings, on, his, experiments, and, models, would, become, influential, on, future, aviation, pioneers, alphonse, p, naud, would, later, develop, coaxial, rotor, model, helicopter, toys, in, 1870, also, powered, by, rubber, bands, one, of, these, toys, given, as, a, gift, by, their, father, would, inspire, the, wright, brothers, to, pursue, the, dream, of, flight, in, 1861, the, word, helicopter, was, coined, by, gustave, de, ponton, d, am, court, a, french, inventor, who, demonstrated, a, small, steam, powered, model, while, celebrated, as, an, innovative, use, of, a, new, metal, aluminum, the, model, never, lifted, off, the, ground, d, amecourt, s, linguistic, contribution, would, survive, to, eventually, describe, the, vertical, flight, he, had, envisioned, steam, power, was, popular, with, other, inventors, as, well, in, 1877, the, italian, engineer, inventor, and, aeronautical, pioneer, enrico, forlanini, developed, an, unmanned, helicopter, powered, by, a, steam, engine, it, rose, to, a, height, of, 13, meters, 43, feet, where, it, remained, for, 20, seconds, after, a, vertical, take, off, from, a, park, in, milan, milan, has, dedicated, its, city, airport, to, enrico, forlanini, also, named, linate, airport, as, well, as, the, nearby, park, the, parco, forlanini, emmanuel, dieuaide, s, steam, powered, design, featured, counter, rotating, rotors, powered, through, a, hose, from, a, boiler, on, the, ground, in, 1887, parisian, inventor, gustave, trouv, built, and, flew, a, tethered, electric, model, helicopter, in, july, 1901, the, maiden, flight, of, hermann, ganswindt, s, helicopter, took, place, in, berlin, sch, neberg, this, was, probably, the, first, heavier, than, air, motor, driven, flight, carrying, humans, a, movie, covering, the, event, was, taken, by, max, skladanowsky, but, it, remains, lost, in, 1885, thomas, edison, was, given, us, 1, 000, equivalent, to, 34, 000, today, by, james, gordon, bennett, jr, to, conduct, experiments, towards, developing, flight, edison, built, a, helicopter, and, used, the, paper, for, a, stock, ticker, to, create, guncotton, with, which, he, attempted, to, power, an, internal, combustion, engine, the, helicopter, was, damaged, by, explosions, and, one, of, his, workers, was, badly, burned, edison, reported, that, it, would, take, a, motor, with, a, ratio, of, three, to, four, pounds, per, horsepower, produced, to, be, successful, based, on, his, experiments, j, n, bah, a, slovak, inventor, adapted, the, internal, combustion, engine, to, power, his, helicopter, model, that, reached, a, height, of, 0, 5, meters, 1, 6, feet, in, 1901, on, 5, may, 1905, his, helicopter, reached, 4, meters, 13, feet, in, altitude, and, flew, for, over, 1, 500, meters, 4, 900, feet, in, 1908, edison, patented, his, own, design, for, a, helicopter, powered, by, a, gasoline, engine, with, box, kites, attached, to, a, mast, by, cables, for, a, rotor, but, it, never, flew, in, 1906, two, french, brothers, jacques, and, louis, breguet, began, experimenting, with, airfoils, for, helicopters, in, 1907, those, experiments, resulted, in, the, gyroplane, no, 1, possibly, as, the, earliest, known, example, of, a, quadcopter, although, there, is, some, uncertainty, about, the, date, sometime, between, 14, august, and, 29, september, 1907, the, gyroplane, no, 1, lifted, its, pilot, into, the, air, about, 0, 6, metres, 2, ft, for, a, minute, the, gyroplane, no, 1, proved, to, be, extremely, unsteady, and, required, a, man, at, each, corner, of, the, airframe, to, hold, it, steady, for, this, reason, the, flights, of, the, gyroplane, no, 1, are, considered, to, be, the, first, manned, flight, of, a, helicopter, but, not, a, free, or, untethered, flight, that, same, year, fellow, french, inventor, paul, cornu, designed, and, built, the, cornu, helicopter, which, used, two, 6, 1, metre, 20, ft, counter, rotating, rotors, driven, by, a, 24, hp, 18, kw, antoinette, engine, on, 13, november, 1907, it, lifted, its, inventor, to, 0, 3, metres, 1, ft, and, remained, aloft, for, 20, seconds, even, though, this, flight, did, not, surpass, the, flight, of, the, gyroplane, no, 1, it, was, reported, to, be, the, first, truly, free, flight, with, a, pilot, cornu, s, helicopter, completed, a, few, more, flights, and, achieved, a, height, of, nearly, 2, 0, metres, 6, 5, ft, but, it, proved, to, be, unstable, and, was, abandoned, in, 1909, j, newton, williams, of, derby, connecticut, and, emile, berliner, of, washington, d, c, flew, a, helicopter, on, three, occasions, at, berliner, s, lab, in, washington, s, brightwood, neighborhood, in, 1911, slovenian, philosopher, and, economist, ivan, slokar, patented, a, helicopter, configuration, the, danish, inventor, jacob, ellehammer, built, the, ellehammer, helicopter, in, 1912, it, consisted, of, a, frame, equipped, with, two, counter, rotating, discs, each, of, which, was, fitted, with, six, vanes, around, its, circumference, after, indoor, tests, the, aircraft, was, demonstrated, outdoors, and, made, several, free, take, offs, experiments, with, the, helicopter, continued, until, september, 1916, when, it, tipped, over, during, take, off, destroying, its, rotors, during, world, war, i, austria, hungary, developed, the, pkz, an, experimental, helicopter, prototype, with, two, aircraft, built, in, the, early, 1920s, argentine, ra, l, pateras, pescara, de, castelluccio, while, working, in, europe, demonstrated, one, of, the, first, successful, applications, of, cyclic, pitch, coaxial, contra, rotating, biplane, rotors, could, be, warped, to, cyclically, increase, and, decrease, the, lift, they, produced, the, rotor, hub, could, also, be, tilted, forward, a, few, degrees, allowing, the, aircraft, to, move, forward, without, a, separate, propeller, to, push, or, pull, it, pateras, pescara, was, also, able, to, demonstrate, the, principle, of, autorotation, by, january, 1924, pescara, s, helicopter, no, 1, was, tested, but, was, found, to, be, underpowered, and, could, not, lift, its, own, weight, his, 2f, fared, better, and, set, a, record, the, british, government, funded, further, research, by, pescara, which, resulted, in, helicopter, no, 3, powered, by, a, 250, horsepower, 190, kw, radial, engine, which, could, fly, for, up, to, ten, minutes, in, march, 1923, time, magazine, reported, thomas, edison, sent, george, de, bothezat, a, congratulations, for, a, successful, helicopter, test, flight, edison, wrote, so, far, as, i, know, you, have, produced, the, first, successful, helicopter, the, helicopter, was, tested, at, mccook, s, field, and, remained, airborne, for, 2, minutes, and, 45, seconds, at, a, height, of, 15, feet, on, 14, april, 1924, frenchman, tienne, oehmichen, set, the, first, helicopter, world, record, recognized, by, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, fai, flying, his, quadrotor, helicopter, 360, meters, 1, 180, ft, on, 18, april, 1924, pescara, beat, oemichen, s, record, flying, for, a, distance, of, 736, meters, 2, 415, ft, nearly, 0, 80, kilometers, or, 5, miles, in, 4, minutes, and, 11, seconds, about, 13, km, h, or, 8, mph, maintaining, a, height, of, 1, 8, meters, 6, feet, on, 4, may, oehmichen, completed, the, first, one, kilometer, 0, 62, mi, closed, circuit, helicopter, flight, in, 7, minutes, 40, seconds, with, his, no, 2, machine, in, the, us, george, de, bothezat, built, the, quadrotor, helicopter, de, bothezat, helicopter, for, the, united, states, army, air, service, but, the, army, cancelled, the, program, in, 1924, and, the, aircraft, was, scrapped, albert, gillis, von, baumhauer, a, dutch, aeronautical, engineer, began, studying, rotorcraft, design, in, 1923, his, first, prototype, flew, hopped, and, hovered, in, reality, on, 24, september, 1925, with, dutch, army, air, arm, captain, floris, albert, van, heijst, at, the, controls, the, controls, that, van, heijst, used, were, von, baumhauer, s, inventions, the, cyclic, and, collective, patents, were, granted, to, von, baumhauer, for, his, cyclic, and, collective, controls, by, the, british, ministry, of, aviation, on, 31, january, 1927, under, patent, number, 265, 272, in, 1927, engelbert, zaschka, from, germany, built, a, helicopter, equipped, with, two, rotors, in, which, a, gyroscope, was, used, to, increase, stability, and, serves, as, an, energy, accumulator, for, a, gliding, flight, to, make, a, landing, zaschka, s, aircraft, the, first, helicopter, which, ever, worked, so, successfully, in, miniature, not, only, rises, and, descends, vertically, but, is, able, to, remain, stationary, at, any, height, in, 1928, hungarian, aviation, engineer, oszk, r, asb, th, constructed, a, helicopter, prototype, that, took, off, and, landed, at, least, 182, times, with, a, maximum, single, flight, duration, of, 53, minutes, in, 1930, the, italian, engineer, corradino, d, ascanio, built, his, d, at3, a, coaxial, helicopter, his, relatively, large, machine, had, two, two, bladed, counter, rotating, rotors, control, was, achieved, by, using, auxiliary, wings, or, servo, tabs, on, the, trailing, edges, of, the, blades, a, concept, that, was, later, adopted, by, other, helicopter, designers, including, bleeker, and, kaman, three, small, propellers, mounted, to, the, airframe, were, used, for, additional, pitch, roll, and, yaw, control, the, d, at3, held, modest, fai, speed, and, altitude, records, for, the, time, including, altitude, 18, m, or, 59, ft, duration, 8, minutes, 45, seconds, and, distance, flown, 1, 078, m, or, 3, 540, ft, spanish, aeronautical, engineer, and, pilot, juan, de, la, cierva, invented, the, autogyro, in, the, early, 1920s, becoming, the, first, practical, rotorcraft, in, 1928, de, la, cierva, successfully, flew, an, autogyro, across, the, english, channel, from, london, to, paris, in, 1934, an, autogyro, became, the, first, rotorcraft, to, successfully, take, off, and, land, on, the, deck, of, a, ship, that, same, year, the, autogyro, was, employed, by, the, spanish, military, during, the, asturias, revolt, becoming, the, first, military, deployment, of, a, rotocraft, autogyros, were, also, employed, in, new, jersey, and, pennsylvania, for, delivering, mail, and, newspapers, prior, to, the, invention, of, the, helicopter, though, lacking, true, vertical, flight, capability, work, on, the, autogyro, forms, the, basis, for, helicopter, analysis, in, the, soviet, union, boris, n, yuriev, and, alexei, m, cheremukhin, two, aeronautical, engineers, working, at, the, tsentralniy, aerogidrodinamicheskiy, institut, tsagi, or, the, central, aerohydrodynamic, institute, constructed, and, flew, the, tsagi, 1, ea, single, lift, rotor, helicopter, which, used, an, open, tubing, framework, a, four, blade, main, lift, rotor, and, twin, sets, of, 1, 8, meter, 5, 9, foot, diameter, two, bladed, anti, torque, rotors, one, set, of, two, at, the, nose, and, one, set, of, two, at, the, tail, powered, by, two, m, 2, powerplants, up, rated, copies, of, the, gnome, monosoupape, 9, type, b, 2, 100, cv, output, rotary, engine, of, world, war, i, the, tsagi, 1, ea, made, several, low, altitude, flights, by, 14, august, 1932, cheremukhin, managed, to, get, the, 1, ea, up, to, an, unofficial, altitude, of, 605, meters, 1, 985, feet, shattering, d, ascanio, s, earlier, achievement, as, the, soviet, union, was, not, yet, a, member, of, the, fai, however, cheremukhin, s, record, remained, unrecognized, nicolas, florine, a, russian, engineer, built, the, first, twin, tandem, rotor, machine, to, perform, a, free, flight, it, flew, in, sint, genesius, rode, at, the, laboratoire, a, rotechnique, de, belgique, now, von, karman, institute, in, april, 1933, and, attained, an, altitude, of, six, meters, 20, feet, and, an, endurance, of, eight, minutes, florine, chose, a, co, rotating, configuration, because, the, gyroscopic, stability, of, the, rotors, would, not, cancel, therefore, the, rotors, had, to, be, tilted, slightly, in, opposite, directions, to, counter, torque, using, hingeless, rotors, and, co, rotation, also, minimised, the, stress, on, the, hull, at, the, time, it, was, one, of, the, most, stable, helicopters, in, existence, the, br, guet, dorand, gyroplane, laboratoire, was, built, in, 1933, it, was, a, coaxial, helicopter, contra, rotating, after, many, ground, tests, and, an, accident, it, first, took, flight, on, 26, june, 1935, within, a, short, time, the, aircraft, was, setting, records, with, pilot, maurice, claisse, at, the, controls, on, 14, december, 1935, he, set, a, record, for, closed, circuit, flight, with, a, 500, meter, 1, 600, foot, diameter, the, next, year, on, 26, september, 1936, claisse, set, a, height, record, of, 158, meters, 518, feet, and, finally, on, 24, november, 1936, he, set, a, flight, duration, record, of, one, hour, two, minutes, and, 50, seconds, over, a, 44, kilometers, 27, miles, closed, circuit, at, 44, 7, kilometres, per, hour, 27, 8, mph, the, aircraft, was, destroyed, in, 1943, by, an, allied, airstrike, at, villacoublay, airport, american, inventor, arthur, m, young, started, work, on, model, helicopters, in, 1928, using, converted, electric, hover, motors, to, drive, the, rotor, head, young, invented, the, stabilizer, bar, and, patented, it, shortly, after, a, mutual, friend, introduced, young, to, lawrence, dale, who, once, seeing, his, work, asked, him, to, join, the, bell, aircraft, company, when, young, arrived, at, bell, in, 1941, he, signed, his, patent, over, and, began, work, on, the, helicopter, his, budget, was, us, 250, 000, equivalent, to, 5, 2, million, today, to, build, two, working, helicopters, in, just, six, months, they, completed, the, first, bell, model, 1, which, spawned, the, bell, model, 30, later, succeeded, by, the, bell, 47, heinrich, focke, at, focke, wulf, had, purchased, a, license, from, cierva, autogiro, company, which, according, to, frank, kingston, smith, sr, included, the, fully, controllable, cyclic, collective, pitch, hub, system, in, return, cierva, autogiro, received, a, cross, license, to, build, the, focke, achgelis, helicopters, focke, designed, the, world, s, first, practical, helicopter, the, transverse, twin, rotor, focke, wulf, fw, 61, which, first, flew, in, june, 1936, it, was, demonstrated, by, hanna, reitsch, in, february, 1938, inside, the, deutschlandhalle, in, berlin, the, fw, 61, set, a, number, of, fai, records, from, 1937, to, 1939, including, maximum, altitude, of, 3, 427, metres, 11, 243, ft, maximum, distance, of, 230, kilometres, 140, mi, and, maximum, speed, of, 124, kilometres, per, hour, 77, mph, autogiro, development, was, now, being, bypassed, by, a, focus, on, helicopters, during, world, war, ii, nazi, germany, used, helicopters, in, small, numbers, for, observation, transport, and, medical, evacuation, the, flettner, fl, 282, kolibri, synchropter, using, the, same, basic, configuration, as, anton, flettner, s, own, pioneering, fl, 265, was, used, in, the, baltic, mediterranean, and, aegean, seas, the, focke, achgelis, fa, 223, drache, like, the, fw, 61, used, two, transverse, rotors, and, was, the, largest, rotorcraft, of, the, war, extensive, bombing, by, the, allied, forces, prevented, germany, from, producing, helicopters, in, large, quantities, during, the, war, in, the, united, states, russian, born, engineer, igor, sikorsky, and, wynn, laurence, lepage, competed, to, produce, the, u, s, military, s, first, helicopter, lepage, received, the, patent, rights, to, develop, helicopters, patterned, after, the, fw, 61, and, built, the, xr, 1, in, 1941, meanwhile, sikorsky, settled, on, a, simpler, single, rotor, design, the, vs, 300, of, 1939, which, turned, out, to, be, the, first, practical, single, lifting, rotor, helicopter, design, after, experimenting, with, configurations, to, counteract, the, torque, produced, by, the, single, main, rotor, sikorsky, settled, on, a, single, smaller, rotor, mounted, on, the, tail, boom, developed, from, the, vs, 300, sikorsky, s, r, 4, of, 1942, was, the, first, large, scale, mass, produced, helicopter, with, a, production, order, for, 100, aircraft, the, r, 4, was, the, only, allied, helicopter, to, serve, in, world, war, ii, used, primarily, for, search, and, rescue, by, the, usaaf, 1st, air, commando, group, in, the, burma, campaign, in, alaska, and, in, other, areas, with, harsh, terrain, total, production, reached, 131, helicopters, before, the, r, 4, was, replaced, by, other, sikorsky, helicopters, such, as, the, r, 5, and, the, r, 6, in, all, sikorsky, produced, over, 400, helicopters, before, the, end, of, world, war, ii, while, lepage, and, sikorsky, built, their, helicopters, for, the, military, bell, aircraft, hired, arthur, young, to, help, build, a, helicopter, using, young, s, two, blade, teetering, rotor, design, which, used, a, weighted, stabilizer, bar, placed, at, a, 90, angle, to, the, rotor, blades, the, subsequent, model, 30, helicopter, of, 1943, showed, the, design, s, simplicity, and, ease, of, use, the, model, 30, was, developed, into, the, bell, 47, of, 1945, which, became, the, first, helicopter, certified, for, civilian, use, in, the, united, states, march, 1946, produced, in, several, countries, the, bell, 47, was, the, most, popular, helicopter, model, for, nearly, 30, years, in, 1951, at, the, urging, of, his, contacts, at, the, department, of, the, navy, charles, kaman, modified, his, k, 225, synchropter, a, design, for, a, twin, rotor, helicopter, concept, first, pioneered, by, anton, flettner, in, 1939, with, the, aforementioned, fl, 265, piston, engined, design, in, germany, with, a, new, kind, of, engine, the, turboshaft, engine, this, adaptation, of, the, turbine, engine, provided, a, large, amount, of, power, to, kaman, s, helicopter, with, a, lower, weight, penalty, than, piston, engines, with, their, heavy, engine, blocks, and, auxiliary, components, on, 11, december, 1951, the, kaman, k, 225, became, the, first, turbine, powered, helicopter, in, the, world, two, years, later, on, 26, march, 1954, a, modified, navy, htk, 1, another, kaman, helicopter, became, the, first, twin, turbine, helicopter, to, fly, however, it, was, the, sud, aviation, alouette, ii, that, would, become, the, first, helicopter, to, be, produced, with, a, turbine, engine, reliable, helicopters, capable, of, stable, hover, flight, were, developed, decades, after, fixed, wing, aircraft, this, is, largely, due, to, higher, engine, power, density, requirements, than, fixed, wing, aircraft, improvements, in, fuels, and, engines, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, were, a, critical, factor, in, helicopter, development, the, availability, of, lightweight, turboshaft, engines, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, led, to, the, development, of, larger, faster, and, higher, performance, helicopters, while, smaller, and, less, expensive, helicopters, still, use, piston, engines, turboshaft, engines, are, the, preferred, powerplant, for, helicopters, today, there, are, several, reasons, a, helicopter, cannot, fly, as, fast, as, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, when, the, helicopter, is, hovering, the, outer, tips, of, the, rotor, travel, at, a, speed, determined, by, the, length, of, the, blade, and, the, rotational, speed, in, a, moving, helicopter, however, the, speed, of, the, blades, relative, to, the, air, depends, on, the, speed, of, the, helicopter, as, well, as, on, their, rotational, speed, the, airspeed, of, the, advancing, rotor, blade, is, much, higher, than, that, of, the, helicopter, itself, it, is, possible, for, this, blade, to, exceed, the, speed, of, sound, and, thus, produce, vastly, increased, drag, and, vibration, at, the, same, time, the, advancing, blade, creates, more, lift, traveling, forward, the, retreating, blade, produces, less, lift, if, the, aircraft, were, to, accelerate, to, the, air, speed, that, the, blade, tips, are, spinning, the, retreating, blade, passes, through, air, moving, at, the, same, speed, of, the, blade, and, produces, no, lift, at, all, resulting, in, very, high, torque, stresses, on, the, central, shaft, that, can, tip, down, the, retreating, blade, side, of, the, vehicle, and, cause, a, loss, of, control, dual, counter, rotating, blades, prevent, this, situation, due, to, having, two, advancing, and, two, retreating, blades, with, balanced, forces, because, the, advancing, blade, has, higher, airspeed, than, the, retreating, blade, and, generates, a, dissymmetry, of, lift, rotor, blades, are, designed, to, flap, lift, and, twist, in, such, a, way, that, the, advancing, blade, flaps, up, and, develops, a, smaller, angle, of, attack, conversely, the, retreating, blade, flaps, down, develops, a, higher, angle, of, attack, and, generates, more, lift, at, high, speeds, the, force, on, the, rotors, is, such, that, they, flap, excessively, and, the, retreating, blade, can, reach, too, high, an, angle, and, stall, for, this, reason, the, maximum, safe, forward, airspeed, of, a, helicopter, is, given, a, design, rating, called, v, ne, velocity, never, exceed, in, addition, it, is, possible, for, the, helicopter, to, fly, at, an, airspeed, where, an, excessive, amount, of, the, retreating, blade, stalls, which, results, in, high, vibration, pitch, up, and, roll, into, the, retreating, blade, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, designers, began, working, on, helicopter, noise, reduction, urban, communities, have, often, expressed, great, dislike, of, noisy, aviation, or, noisy, aircraft, and, police, and, passenger, helicopters, can, be, unpopular, because, of, the, sound, the, redesigns, followed, the, closure, of, some, city, heliports, and, government, action, to, constrain, flight, paths, in, national, parks, and, other, places, of, natural, beauty, to, reduce, vibration, all, helicopters, have, rotor, adjustments, for, height, and, weight, a, maladjusted, helicopter, can, easily, vibrate, so, much, that, it, will, shake, itself, apart, blade, height, is, adjusted, by, changing, the, pitch, of, the, blade, weight, is, adjusted, by, adding, or, removing, weights, on, the, rotor, head, and, or, at, the, blade, end, caps, most, also, have, vibration, dampers, for, height, and, pitch, some, also, use, mechanical, feedback, systems, to, sense, and, counter, vibration, usually, the, feedback, system, uses, a, mass, as, a, stable, reference, and, a, linkage, from, the, mass, operates, a, flap, to, adjust, the, rotor, s, angle, of, attack, to, counter, the, vibration, adjustment, can, be, difficult, in, part, because, measurement, of, the, vibration, is, hard, usually, requiring, sophisticated, accelerometers, mounted, throughout, the, airframe, and, gearboxes, the, most, common, blade, vibration, adjustment, measurement, system, is, to, use, a, stroboscopic, flash, lamp, and, observe, painted, markings, or, coloured, reflectors, on, the, underside, of, the, rotor, blades, the, traditional, low, tech, system, is, to, mount, coloured, chalk, on, the, rotor, tips, and, see, how, they, mark, a, linen, sheet, health, and, usage, monitoring, systems, hums, provide, vibration, monitoring, and, rotor, track, and, balance, solutions, to, limit, vibration, gearbox, vibration, most, often, requires, a, gearbox, overhaul, or, replacement, gearbox, or, drive, train, vibrations, can, be, extremely, harmful, to, a, pilot, the, most, severe, effects, are, pain, numbness, and, loss, of, tactile, discrimination, or, dexterity, for, a, standard, helicopter, with, a, single, main, rotor, the, tips, of, the, main, rotor, blades, produce, a, vortex, ring, in, the, air, which, is, a, spiraling, and, circularly, rotating, airflow, as, the, craft, moves, forward, these, vortices, trail, off, behind, the, craft, when, hovering, with, a, forward, diagonal, crosswind, or, moving, in, a, forward, diagonal, direction, the, spinning, vortices, trailing, off, the, main, rotor, blades, will, align, with, the, rotation, of, the, tail, rotor, and, cause, an, instability, in, flight, control, when, the, trailing, vortices, colliding, with, the, tail, rotor, are, rotating, in, the, same, direction, this, causes, a, loss, of, thrust, from, the, tail, rotor, when, the, trailing, vortices, rotate, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, tail, rotor, thrust, is, increased, use, of, the, foot, pedals, is, required, to, adjust, the, tail, rotor, s, angle, of, attack, to, compensate, for, these, instabilities, these, issues, are, due, to, the, exposed, tail, rotor, cutting, through, open, air, around, the, rear, of, the, vehicle, this, issue, disappears, when, the, tail, is, instead, ducted, using, an, internal, impeller, enclosed, in, the, tail, and, a, jet, of, high, pressure, air, sideways, out, of, the, tail, as, the, main, rotor, vortices, can, not, impact, the, operation, of, an, internal, impeller, for, a, standard, helicopter, with, a, single, main, rotor, maintaining, steady, flight, with, a, crosswind, presents, an, additional, flight, control, problem, where, strong, crosswinds, from, certain, angles, will, increase, or, decrease, lift, from, the, main, rotors, this, effect, is, also, triggered, in, a, no, wind, condition, when, moving, the, craft, diagonally, in, various, directions, depending, on, the, direction, of, main, rotor, rotation, this, can, lead, to, a, loss, of, control, and, a, crash, or, hard, landing, when, operating, at, low, altitudes, due, to, the, sudden, unexpected, loss, of, lift, and, insufficient, time, and, distance, available, to, recover, conventional, rotary, wing, aircraft, use, a, set, of, complex, mechanical, gearboxes, to, convert, the, high, rotation, speed, of, gas, turbines, into, the, low, speed, required, to, drive, main, and, tail, rotors, unlike, powerplants, mechanical, gearboxes, cannot, be, duplicated, for, redundancy, and, have, always, been, a, major, weak, point, in, helicopter, reliability, in, flight, catastrophic, gear, failures, often, result, in, gearbox, jamming, and, subsequent, fatalities, whereas, loss, of, lubrication, can, trigger, onboard, fire, another, weakness, of, mechanical, gearboxes, is, their, transient, power, limitation, due, to, structural, fatigue, limits, recent, easa, studies, point, to, engines, and, transmissions, as, prime, cause, of, crashes, just, after, pilot, errors, by, contrast, electromagnetic, transmissions, do, not, use, any, parts, in, contact, hence, lubrication, can, be, drastically, simplified, or, eliminated, their, inherent, redundancy, offers, good, resilience, to, single, point, of, failure, the, absence, of, gears, enables, high, power, transient, without, impact, on, service, life, the, concept, of, electric, propulsion, applied, to, helicopter, and, electromagnetic, drive, was, brought, to, reality, by, pascal, chretien, who, designed, built, and, flew, world, s, first, man, carrying, free, flying, electric, helicopter, the, concept, was, taken, from, the, conceptual, computer, aided, design, model, on, 10, september, 2010, to, the, first, testing, at, 30, power, on, 1, march, 2011, less, than, six, months, the, aircraft, first, flew, on, 12, august, 2011, all, development, was, conducted, in, venelles, france, as, with, any, moving, vehicle, unsafe, operation, could, result, in, loss, of, control, structural, damage, or, loss, of, life, the, following, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, potential, hazards, for, helicopters
