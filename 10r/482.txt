medical, ultrasound, includes, diagnostic, techniques, mainly, imaging, techniques, using, ultrasound, as, well, as, therapeutic, applications, of, ultrasound, in, diagnosis, it, is, used, to, create, an, image, of, internal, body, structures, such, as, tendons, muscles, joints, blood, vessels, and, internal, organs, to, measure, some, characteristics, e, g, distances, and, velocities, or, to, generate, an, informative, audible, sound, the, usage, of, ultrasound, to, produce, visual, images, for, medicine, is, called, medical, ultrasonography, or, simply, sonography, or, echography, the, practice, of, examining, pregnant, women, using, ultrasound, is, called, obstetric, ultrasonography, and, was, an, early, development, of, clinical, ultrasonography, the, machine, used, is, called, an, ultrasound, machine, a, sonograph, or, an, echograph, the, visual, image, formed, using, this, technique, is, called, an, ultrasonogram, a, sonogram, or, an, echogram, ultrasound, is, composed, of, sound, waves, with, frequencies, greater, than, 20, 000, hz, which, is, the, approximate, upper, threshold, of, human, hearing, ultrasonic, images, also, known, as, sonograms, are, created, by, sending, pulses, of, ultrasound, into, tissue, using, a, probe, the, ultrasound, pulses, echo, off, tissues, with, different, reflection, properties, and, are, returned, to, the, probe, which, records, and, displays, them, as, an, image, a, general, purpose, ultrasonic, transducer, may, be, used, for, most, imaging, purposes, but, some, situations, may, require, the, use, of, a, specialized, transducer, most, ultrasound, examination, is, done, using, a, transducer, on, the, surface, of, the, body, but, improved, visualization, is, often, possible, if, a, transducer, can, be, placed, inside, the, body, for, this, purpose, special, use, transducers, including, transvaginal, endorectal, and, transesophageal, transducers, are, commonly, employed, at, the, extreme, very, small, transducers, can, be, mounted, on, small, diameter, catheters, and, placed, within, blood, vessels, to, image, the, walls, and, disease, of, those, vessels, the, imaging, mode, refers, to, probe, and, machine, settings, that, result, in, specific, dimensions, of, the, ultrasound, image, several, modes, of, ultrasound, are, used, in, medical, imaging, most, machines, convert, two, way, time, to, imaging, depth, using, as, assumed, speed, of, sound, of, 1540, m, s, as, the, actual, speed, of, sound, varies, greatly, in, different, tissue, types, an, ultrasound, image, is, therefore, not, a, true, tomographic, representation, of, the, body, three, dimensional, imaging, is, done, by, combining, b, mode, images, using, dedicated, rotating, or, stationary, probes, this, has, also, been, referred, to, as, c, mode, an, imaging, technique, refers, to, a, method, of, signal, generation, and, processing, that, results, in, a, specific, application, most, imaging, techniques, are, operating, in, b, mode, therapeutic, ultrasound, aimed, at, a, specific, tumor, or, calculus, is, not, an, imaging, mode, however, for, positioning, a, treatment, probe, to, focus, on, a, specific, region, of, interest, a, mode, and, b, mode, are, typically, used, often, during, treatment, compared, to, other, medical, imaging, modalities, ultrasound, has, several, advantages, it, provides, images, in, real, time, is, portable, and, can, consequently, be, brought, to, the, bedside, it, is, substantially, lower, in, cost, than, other, imaging, strategies, drawbacks, include, various, limits, on, its, field, of, view, the, need, for, patient, cooperation, dependence, on, patient, physique, difficulty, imaging, structures, obscured, by, bone, air, or, gases, and, the, necessity, of, a, skilled, operator, usually, with, professional, training, sonography, ultrasonography, is, widely, used, in, medicine, it, is, possible, to, perform, both, diagnosis, and, therapeutic, procedures, using, ultrasound, to, guide, interventional, procedures, such, as, biopsies, or, to, drain, collections, of, fluid, which, can, be, both, diagnostic, and, therapeutic, sonographers, are, medical, professionals, who, perform, scans, which, are, traditionally, interpreted, by, radiologists, physicians, who, specialize, in, the, application, and, interpretation, of, medical, imaging, modalities, or, by, cardiologists, in, the, case, of, cardiac, ultrasonography, echocardiography, sonography, is, effective, for, imaging, soft, tissues, of, the, body, superficial, structures, such, as, muscle, tendon, testis, breast, thyroid, and, parathyroid, glands, and, the, neonatal, brain, are, imaged, at, higher, frequencies, 7, 18, mhz, which, provide, better, linear, axial, and, horizontal, lateral, resolution, deeper, structures, such, as, liver, and, kidney, are, imaged, at, lower, frequencies, 1, 6, mhz, with, lower, axial, and, lateral, resolution, as, a, price, of, deeper, tissue, penetration, in, anesthesiology, ultrasound, is, commonly, used, to, guide, the, placement, of, needles, when, injecting, local, anesthetic, solutions, in, the, proximity, of, nerves, identified, within, the, ultrasound, image, nerve, block, it, is, also, used, for, vascular, access, such, as, cannulation, of, large, central, veins, and, for, difficult, arterial, cannulation, transcranial, doppler, is, frequently, used, by, neuro, anesthesiologists, for, obtaining, information, about, flow, velocity, in, the, basal, cerebral, vessels, in, angiology, or, vascular, medicine, duplex, ultrasound, b, mode, imaging, combined, with, doppler, flow, measurement, is, used, to, diagnose, arterial, and, venous, disease, this, is, particularly, important, in, potential, neurologic, problems, where, carotid, ultrasound, is, commonly, used, for, assessing, blood, flow, and, potential, or, suspected, stenosis, in, the, carotid, arteries, while, transcranial, doppler, is, used, for, imaging, flow, in, the, intracerebral, arteries, intravascular, ultrasound, ivus, uses, a, specially, designed, catheter, with, a, miniaturized, ultrasound, probe, attached, to, its, distal, end, which, is, then, threaded, inside, a, blood, vessel, the, proximal, end, of, the, catheter, is, attached, to, computerized, ultrasound, equipment, and, allows, the, application, of, ultrasound, technology, such, as, a, piezoelectric, transducer, or, capacitive, micromachined, ultrasonic, transducer, to, visualize, the, endothelium, of, blood, vessels, in, living, individuals, in, the, case, of, the, common, and, potentially, serious, problem, of, blood, clots, in, the, deep, veins, of, the, leg, ultrasound, plays, a, key, diagnostic, role, while, ultrasonography, of, chronic, venous, insufficiency, of, the, legs, focuses, on, more, superficial, veins, to, assist, with, planning, of, suitable, interventions, to, relieve, symptoms, or, improve, cosmetics, echocardiography, is, an, essential, tool, in, cardiology, assisting, in, evaluation, of, heart, valve, function, such, as, stenosis, or, insufficiency, strength, of, cardiac, muscle, contraction, and, hypertrophy, or, dilatation, of, the, main, chambers, ventricle, and, atrium, point, of, care, ultrasound, has, many, applications, in, emergency, medicine, these, include, differentiating, cardiac, from, pulmonary, causes, of, acute, breathlessness, and, the, focused, assessment, with, sonography, for, trauma, fast, exam, extended, to, include, assessment, for, significant, hemoperitoneum, or, pericardial, tamponade, after, trauma, efast, other, uses, include, assisting, with, differentiating, causes, of, abdominal, pain, such, as, gallstones, and, kidney, stones, emergency, medicine, residency, programs, have, a, substantial, history, of, promoting, the, use, of, bedside, ultrasound, during, physician, training, both, abdominal, and, endoanal, ultrasound, are, frequently, used, in, gastroenterology, and, colorectal, surgery, in, abdominal, sonography, the, major, organs, of, the, abdomen, such, as, the, pancreas, aorta, inferior, vena, cava, liver, gall, bladder, bile, ducts, kidneys, and, spleen, may, be, imaged, however, sound, waves, may, be, blocked, by, gas, in, the, bowel, and, attenuated, to, differing, degrees, by, fat, sometimes, limiting, diagnostic, capabilities, the, appendix, can, sometimes, be, seen, when, inflamed, e, g, appendicitis, and, ultrasound, is, the, initial, imaging, choice, avoiding, radiation, if, possible, although, it, frequently, needs, to, be, followed, by, other, imaging, methods, such, as, ct, endoanal, ultrasound, is, used, particularly, in, the, investigation, of, anorectal, symptoms, such, as, fecal, incontinence, or, obstructed, defecation, it, images, the, immediate, perianal, anatomy, and, is, able, to, detect, occult, defects, such, as, tearing, of, the, anal, sphincter, ultrasonography, of, liver, tumors, allows, for, both, detection, and, characterization, ultrasound, imaging, studies, are, often, obtained, during, the, evaluation, process, of, fatty, liver, disease, ultrasonography, reveals, a, bright, liver, with, increased, echogenicity, pocket, sized, ultrasound, devices, might, be, used, as, point, of, care, screening, tools, to, diagnose, liver, steatosis, gynecologic, ultrasonography, examines, female, pelvic, organs, specifically, the, uterus, ovaries, and, fallopian, tubes, as, well, as, the, bladder, adnexa, and, pouch, of, douglas, it, uses, transducers, designed, for, approaches, through, the, lower, abdominal, wall, curvilinear, and, sector, and, specialty, transducers, such, as, transvaginal, ultrasound, obstetrical, sonography, was, originally, developed, in, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, by, sir, ian, donald, and, is, commonly, used, during, pregnancy, to, check, the, development, and, presentation, of, the, fetus, it, can, be, used, to, identify, many, conditions, that, could, be, potentially, harmful, to, the, mother, and, or, baby, possibly, remaining, undiagnosed, or, with, delayed, diagnosis, in, the, absence, of, sonography, it, is, currently, believed, that, the, risk, of, delayed, diagnosis, is, greater, than, the, small, risk, if, any, associated, with, undergoing, an, ultrasound, scan, however, its, use, for, non, medical, purposes, such, as, fetal, keepsake, videos, and, photos, is, discouraged, obstetric, ultrasound, is, primarily, used, to, according, to, the, european, committee, of, medical, ultrasound, safety, ecmus, ultrasonic, examinations, should, only, be, performed, by, competent, personnel, who, are, trained, and, updated, in, safety, matters, ultrasound, produces, heating, pressure, changes, and, mechanical, disturbances, in, tissue, diagnostic, levels, of, ultrasound, can, produce, temperature, rises, that, are, hazardous, to, sensitive, organs, and, the, embryo, fetus, biological, effects, of, non, thermal, origin, have, been, reported, in, animals, but, to, date, no, such, effects, have, been, demonstrated, in, humans, except, when, a, micro, bubble, contrast, agent, is, present, nonetheless, care, should, be, taken, to, use, low, power, settings, and, avoid, pulsed, wave, scanning, of, the, fetal, brain, unless, specifically, indicated, in, high, risk, pregnancies, figures, released, for, the, period, 2005, 2006, by, the, uk, government, department, of, health, show, that, non, obstetric, ultrasound, examinations, constituted, more, than, 65, of, the, total, number, of, ultrasound, scans, conducted, blood, velocity, can, be, measured, in, various, blood, vessels, such, as, middle, cerebral, artery, or, descending, aorta, by, relatively, inexpensive, and, low, risk, ultrasound, doppler, probes, attached, to, portable, monitors, these, provide, non, invasive, or, transcutaneous, non, piercing, minimal, invasive, blood, flow, assessment, common, examples, are, transcranial, doppler, esophageal, doppler, and, suprasternal, doppler, most, structures, of, the, neck, including, the, thyroid, and, parathyroid, glands, lymph, nodes, and, salivary, glands, are, well, visualized, by, high, frequency, ultrasound, with, exceptional, anatomic, detail, ultrasound, is, the, preferred, imaging, modality, for, thyroid, tumors, and, lesions, and, its, use, is, important, in, the, evaluation, preoperative, planning, and, postoperative, surveillance, of, patients, with, thyroid, cancer, many, other, benign, and, malignant, conditions, in, the, head, and, neck, can, be, differentiated, evaluated, and, managed, with, the, help, of, diagnostic, ultrasound, and, ultrasound, guided, procedures, in, neonatology, transcranial, doppler, can, be, used, for, basic, assessment, of, intracerebral, structural, abnormalities, suspected, hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, or, hydrocephalus, and, anoxic, insults, periventricular, leukomalacia, it, can, be, performed, through, the, soft, spots, in, the, skull, of, a, newborn, infant, fontanelle, until, these, completely, close, at, about, 1, year, of, age, by, which, time, they, have, formed, a, virtually, impenetrable, acoustic, barrier, to, ultrasound, the, most, common, site, for, cranial, ultrasound, is, the, anterior, fontanelle, the, smaller, the, fontanelle, the, more, the, image, is, compromised, lung, ultrasound, has, been, found, to, be, useful, in, diagnosing, common, neonatal, respiratory, diseases, such, as, transient, tachypnea, of, the, newborn, respiratory, distress, syndrome, congenital, pneumonia, meconium, aspiration, syndrome, and, pneumothorax, a, neonatal, lung, ultrasound, score, first, described, by, brat, et, al, has, been, found, to, highly, correlate, with, oxygenation, in, the, newborn, in, ophthalmology, and, optometry, there, are, two, major, forms, of, eye, exam, using, ultrasound, ultrasound, is, used, to, assess, the, lungs, in, a, variety, of, settings, including, critical, care, emergency, medicine, trauma, surgery, as, well, as, general, medicine, this, imaging, modality, is, used, at, the, bedside, or, examination, table, to, evaluate, a, number, of, different, lung, abnormalities, as, well, as, to, guide, procedures, such, as, thoracentesis, drainage, of, pleural, fluid, effusion, needle, aspiration, biopsy, and, catheter, placement, although, air, present, in, the, lungs, does, not, allow, good, penetration, of, ultrasound, waves, interpretation, of, specific, artifacts, created, on, the, lung, surface, can, be, used, to, detect, abnormalities, ultrasound, is, routinely, used, in, urology, to, determine, the, amount, of, fluid, retained, in, a, patient, s, bladder, in, a, pelvic, sonogram, images, include, the, uterus, and, ovaries, or, urinary, bladder, in, females, in, males, a, sonogram, will, provide, information, about, the, bladder, prostate, or, testicles, for, example, to, urgently, distinguish, epididymitis, from, testicular, torsion, in, young, males, it, is, used, to, distinguish, more, benign, testicular, masses, varicocele, or, hydrocele, from, testicular, cancer, which, is, curable, but, must, be, treated, to, preserve, health, and, fertility, there, are, two, methods, of, performing, pelvic, sonography, externally, or, internally, the, internal, pelvic, sonogram, is, performed, either, trans, vaginally, in, a, woman, or, transrectally, in, a, man, sonographic, imaging, of, the, pelvic, floor, can, produce, important, diagnostic, information, regarding, the, precise, relationship, of, abnormal, structures, with, other, pelvic, organs, and, it, represents, a, useful, hint, to, treat, patients, with, symptoms, related, to, pelvic, prolapse, double, incontinence, and, obstructed, defecation, it, is, also, used, to, diagnose, and, at, higher, frequencies, to, treat, break, up, kidney, stones, or, kidney, crystals, nephrolithiasis, scrotal, ultrasonography, is, used, in, the, evaluation, of, testicular, pain, and, can, help, identify, solid, masses, ultrasound, is, an, excellent, method, for, the, study, of, the, penis, such, as, indicated, in, trauma, priapism, erectile, dysfunction, or, suspected, peyronie, s, disease, musculoskeletal, ultrasound, is, used, to, examine, tendons, muscles, nerves, ligaments, soft, tissue, masses, and, bone, surfaces, it, is, helpful, in, diagnosing, ligament, sprains, muscles, strains, and, joint, pathology, it, is, an, alternative, or, supplement, to, x, ray, imaging, in, detecting, fractures, of, the, wrist, elbow, and, shoulder, for, patients, up, to, 12, years, fracture, sonography, quantitative, ultrasound, is, an, adjunct, musculoskeletal, test, for, myopathic, disease, in, children, estimates, of, lean, body, mass, in, adults, proxy, measures, of, muscle, quality, i, e, tissue, composition, in, older, adults, with, sarcopenia, ultrasound, can, also, be, used, for, needle, guidance, in, muscle, or, joint, injections, as, in, ultrasound, guided, hip, joint, injection, in, nephrology, ultrasonography, of, the, kidneys, is, essential, in, the, diagnosis, and, management, of, kidney, related, diseases, the, kidneys, are, easily, examined, and, most, pathological, changes, are, distinguishable, with, ultrasound, it, is, an, accessible, versatile, relatively, economic, and, fast, aid, for, decision, making, in, patients, with, renal, symptoms, and, for, guidance, in, renal, intervention, using, b, mode, imaging, assessment, of, renal, anatomy, is, easily, performed, and, us, is, often, used, as, image, guidance, for, renal, interventions, furthermore, novel, applications, in, renal, us, have, been, introduced, with, contrast, enhanced, ultrasound, ceus, elastography, and, fusion, imaging, however, renal, us, has, certain, limitations, and, other, modalities, such, as, ct, cect, and, mri, should, be, considered, for, supplementary, imaging, in, assessing, renal, disease, intravenous, access, for, the, collection, of, blood, samples, to, assist, in, diagnosis, or, laboratory, investigation, including, blood, culture, or, for, administration, of, intravenous, fluids, for, fluid, maintenance, of, replacement, or, blood, transfusion, in, sicker, patients, is, a, common, medical, procedure, the, need, for, intravenous, access, occurs, in, the, outpatient, laboratory, in, the, inpatient, hospital, units, and, most, critically, in, the, emergency, room, and, intensive, care, unit, in, many, situations, intravenous, access, may, be, required, repeatedly, or, over, a, significant, time, period, in, these, latter, circumstances, a, needle, with, an, overlying, catheter, is, introduced, into, the, vein, and, the, catheter, is, then, inserted, securely, into, the, vein, while, the, needle, is, withdrawn, the, chosen, veins, are, most, frequently, selected, from, the, arm, but, in, challenging, situations, a, deeper, vein, from, the, neck, external, jugular, vein, or, upper, arm, subclavian, vein, may, need, to, be, used, there, are, many, reasons, why, the, selection, of, a, suitable, vein, may, be, problematic, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, obesity, previous, injury, to, veins, from, inflammatory, reaction, to, previous, blood, draws, previous, injury, to, veins, from, recreational, drug, use, in, these, challenging, situations, the, insertion, of, a, catheter, into, a, vein, has, been, greatly, assisted, by, the, use, of, ultrasound, the, ultrasound, unit, may, be, cart, based, or, handheld, using, a, linear, transducer, with, a, frequency, of, 10, to, 15, megahertz, in, most, circumstances, choice, of, vein, will, be, limited, by, the, requirement, that, the, vein, is, within, 1, 5, cms, from, the, skin, surface, the, transducer, may, be, placed, longitudinally, or, transversely, over, the, chosen, vein, ultrasound, training, for, intravenous, cannulation, is, offered, in, most, ultrasound, training, programs, the, creation, of, an, image, from, sound, has, three, steps, transmitting, a, sound, wave, receiving, echoes, and, interpreting, those, echoes, a, sound, wave, is, typically, produced, by, a, piezoelectric, transducer, encased, in, a, plastic, housing, strong, short, electrical, pulses, from, the, ultrasound, machine, drive, the, transducer, at, the, desired, frequency, the, frequencies, can, vary, between, 1, and, 18, mhz, though, frequencies, up, to, 50, 100, megahertz, have, been, used, experimentally, in, a, technique, known, as, biomicroscopy, in, special, regions, such, as, the, anterior, chamber, of, the, eye, older, technology, transducers, focused, their, beam, with, physical, lenses, contemporary, technology, transducers, use, digital, antenna, array, techniques, piezoelectric, elements, in, the, transducer, produce, echoes, at, different, times, to, enable, the, ultrasound, machine, to, change, the, direction, and, depth, of, focus, near, the, transducer, the, width, of, the, ultrasound, beam, almost, equals, to, the, width, of, the, transducer, after, reaching, a, distance, from, the, transducer, near, zone, length, or, fresnel, zone, the, beam, width, narrows, to, half, of, the, transducer, width, and, after, that, the, width, increases, far, zone, length, or, fraunhofer, s, zone, where, the, lateral, resolution, decreases, therefore, the, wider, the, transducer, width, and, the, higher, the, frequency, of, ultrasound, the, longer, the, fresnel, zone, and, the, lateral, resolution, can, be, maintained, at, a, greater, depth, from, the, transducer, ultrasound, waves, travel, in, pulses, therefore, a, shorter, pulse, length, requires, higher, bandwidth, greater, number, of, frequencies, to, constitute, the, ultrasound, pulse, as, stated, the, sound, is, focused, either, by, the, shape, of, the, transducer, a, lens, in, front, of, the, transducer, or, a, complex, set, of, control, pulses, from, the, ultrasound, scanner, in, the, beamforming, or, spatial, filtering, technique, this, focusing, produces, an, arc, shaped, sound, wave, from, the, face, of, the, transducer, the, wave, travels, into, the, body, and, comes, into, focus, at, a, desired, depth, materials, on, the, face, of, the, transducer, enable, the, sound, to, be, transmitted, efficiently, into, the, body, often, a, rubbery, coating, a, form, of, impedance, matching, in, addition, a, water, based, gel, is, placed, between, the, patient, s, skin, and, the, probe, to, facilitate, ultrasound, transmission, into, the, body, this, is, because, air, causes, total, reflection, of, ultrasound, impeding, the, transmission, of, ultrasound, into, the, body, the, sound, wave, is, partially, reflected, from, the, layers, between, different, tissues, or, scattered, from, smaller, structures, specifically, sound, is, reflected, anywhere, where, there, are, acoustic, impedance, changes, in, the, body, e, g, blood, cells, in, blood, plasma, small, structures, in, organs, etc, some, of, the, reflections, return, to, the, transducer, the, return, of, the, sound, wave, to, the, transducer, results, in, the, same, process, as, sending, the, sound, wave, in, reverse, the, returned, sound, wave, vibrates, the, transducer, and, the, transducer, turns, the, vibrations, into, electrical, pulses, that, travel, to, the, ultrasonic, scanner, where, they, are, processed, and, transformed, into, a, digital, image, to, make, an, image, the, ultrasound, scanner, must, determine, two, characteristics, from, each, received, echo, once, the, ultrasonic, scanner, determines, these, two, it, can, locate, which, pixel, in, the, image, to, illuminate, and, with, what, intensity, transforming, the, received, signal, into, a, digital, image, may, be, explained, by, using, a, blank, spreadsheet, as, an, analogy, first, picture, a, long, flat, transducer, at, the, top, of, the, sheet, send, pulses, down, the, columns, of, the, spreadsheet, a, b, c, etc, listen, at, each, column, for, any, return, echoes, when, an, echo, is, heard, note, how, long, it, took, for, the, echo, to, return, the, longer, the, wait, the, deeper, the, row, 1, 2, 3, etc, the, strength, of, the, echo, determines, the, brightness, setting, for, that, cell, white, for, a, strong, echo, black, for, a, weak, echo, and, varying, shades, of, grey, for, everything, in, between, when, all, the, echoes, are, recorded, on, the, sheet, a, greyscale, image, has, been, accomplished, in, modern, ultrasound, systems, images, are, derived, from, the, combined, reception, of, echoes, by, multiple, elements, rather, than, a, single, one, these, elements, in, the, transducer, array, work, together, to, receive, signals, a, process, essential, for, optimizing, the, ultrasonic, beam, s, focus, and, producing, detailed, images, one, predominant, method, for, this, is, delay, and, sum, beamforming, the, time, delay, applied, to, each, element, is, calculated, based, on, the, geometrical, relationship, between, the, imaging, point, the, transducer, and, receiver, positions, by, integrating, these, time, adjusted, signals, the, system, pinpoints, focus, onto, specific, tissue, regions, enhancing, image, resolution, and, clarity, the, utilization, of, multiple, element, reception, combined, with, the, delay, and, sum, principles, underpins, the, high, quality, images, characteristic, of, contemporary, ultrasound, scans, images, from, the, ultrasound, scanner, are, transferred, and, displayed, using, the, dicom, standard, normally, very, little, post, processing, is, applied, ultrasonography, sonography, uses, a, probe, containing, multiple, acoustic, transducers, to, send, pulses, of, sound, into, a, material, whenever, a, sound, wave, encounters, a, material, with, a, different, density, acoustical, impedance, some, of, the, sound, wave, is, scattered, but, part, is, reflected, back, to, the, probe, and, is, detected, as, an, echo, the, time, it, takes, for, the, echo, to, travel, back, to, the, probe, is, measured, and, used, to, calculate, the, depth, of, the, tissue, interface, causing, the, echo, the, greater, the, difference, between, acoustic, impedances, the, larger, the, echo, is, if, the, pulse, hits, gases, or, solids, the, density, difference, is, so, great, that, most, of, the, acoustic, energy, is, reflected, and, it, becomes, impossible, to, progress, further, the, frequencies, used, for, medical, imaging, are, generally, in, the, range, of, 1, to, 18, mhz, higher, frequencies, have, a, correspondingly, smaller, wavelength, and, can, be, used, to, make, more, detailed, sonograms, however, the, attenuation, of, the, sound, wave, is, increased, at, higher, frequencies, so, penetration, of, deeper, tissues, necessitates, a, lower, frequency, 3, 5, mhz, penetrating, deep, into, the, body, with, sonography, is, difficult, some, acoustic, energy, is, lost, each, time, an, echo, is, formed, but, most, of, it, approximately, 0, 5, db, cm, depth, mhz, displaystyle, textstyle, 0, 5, frac, mbox, db, mbox, cm, depth, cdot, mbox, mhz, is, lost, from, acoustic, absorption, see, acoustic, attenuation, for, further, details, on, modeling, of, acoustic, attenuation, and, absorption, the, speed, of, sound, varies, as, it, travels, through, different, materials, and, is, dependent, on, the, acoustical, impedance, of, the, material, however, the, sonographic, instrument, assumes, that, the, acoustic, velocity, is, constant, at, 1540, m, s, an, effect, of, this, assumption, is, that, in, a, real, body, with, non, uniform, tissues, the, beam, becomes, somewhat, de, focused, and, image, resolution, is, reduced, to, generate, a, 2, d, image, the, ultrasonic, beam, is, swept, a, transducer, may, be, swept, mechanically, by, rotating, or, swinging, or, a, 1, d, phased, array, transducer, may, be, used, to, sweep, the, beam, electronically, the, received, data, is, processed, and, used, to, construct, the, image, the, image, is, then, a, 2, d, representation, of, the, slice, into, the, body, 3, d, images, can, be, generated, by, acquiring, a, series, of, adjacent, 2, d, images, commonly, a, specialized, probe, that, mechanically, scans, a, conventional, 2, d, image, transducer, is, used, however, since, the, mechanical, scanning, is, slow, it, is, difficult, to, make, 3d, images, of, moving, tissues, recently, 2, d, phased, array, transducers, that, can, sweep, the, beam, in, 3, d, have, been, developed, these, can, image, faster, and, can, even, be, used, to, make, live, 3, d, images, of, a, beating, heart, doppler, ultrasonography, is, used, to, study, blood, flow, and, muscle, motion, the, different, detected, speeds, are, represented, in, color, for, ease, of, interpretation, for, example, leaky, heart, valves, the, leak, shows, up, as, a, flash, of, unique, color, colors, may, alternatively, be, used, to, represent, the, amplitudes, of, the, received, echoes, an, additional, expansion, of, ultrasound, is, bi, planar, ultrasound, in, which, the, probe, has, two, 2d, planes, perpendicular, to, each, other, providing, more, efficient, localization, and, detection, furthermore, an, omniplane, probe, can, rotate, 180, to, obtain, multiple, images, in, 3d, ultrasound, many, 2d, planes, are, digitally, added, together, to, create, a, 3, dimensional, image, of, the, object, doppler, ultrasonography, employs, the, doppler, effect, to, assess, whether, structures, usually, blood, are, moving, towards, or, away, from, the, probe, and, their, relative, velocity, by, calculating, the, frequency, shift, of, a, particular, sample, volume, flow, in, an, artery, or, a, jet, of, blood, flow, over, a, heart, valve, its, speed, and, direction, can, be, determined, and, visualized, as, an, example, color, doppler, is, the, measurement, of, velocity, by, color, scale, color, doppler, images, are, generally, combined, with, gray, scale, b, mode, images, to, display, duplex, ultrasonography, images, uses, include, a, contrast, medium, for, medical, ultrasonography, is, a, formulation, of, encapsulated, gaseous, microbubbles, to, increase, echogenicity, of, blood, discovered, by, dr, raymond, gramiak, in, 1968, and, named, contrast, enhanced, ultrasound, this, contrast, medical, imaging, modality, is, used, throughout, the, world, for, echocardiography, in, particular, in, the, united, states, and, for, ultrasound, radiology, in, europe, and, asia, microbubbles, based, contrast, media, is, administered, intravenously, into, the, patient, blood, stream, during, the, ultrasonography, examination, due, to, their, size, the, microbubbles, remain, confined, in, blood, vessels, without, extravasating, towards, the, interstitial, fluid, an, ultrasound, contrast, media, is, therefore, purely, intravascular, making, it, an, ideal, agent, to, image, organ, microvasculature, for, diagnostic, purposes, a, typical, clinical, use, of, contrast, ultrasonography, is, detection, of, a, hypervascular, metastatic, tumor, which, exhibits, a, contrast, uptake, kinetics, of, microbubbles, concentration, in, blood, circulation, faster, than, healthy, biological, tissue, surrounding, the, tumor, other, clinical, applications, using, contrast, exist, as, in, echocardiography, to, improve, delineation, of, left, ventricle, for, visualizing, contractibility, of, heart, muscle, after, a, myocardial, infarction, finally, applications, in, quantitative, perfusion, relative, measurement, of, blood, flow, have, emerged, for, identifying, early, patient, response, to, anti, cancerous, drug, treatment, methodology, and, clinical, study, by, dr, nathalie, lassau, in, 2011, enabling, the, best, oncological, therapeutic, options, to, be, determined, in, oncological, practice, of, medical, contrast, ultrasonography, clinicians, use, parametric, imaging, of, vascular, signatures, invented, by, dr, nicolas, rognin, in, 2010, this, method, is, conceived, as, a, cancer, aided, diagnostic, tool, facilitating, characterization, of, a, suspicious, tumor, malignant, versus, benign, in, an, organ, this, method, is, based, on, medical, computational, science, to, analyze, a, time, sequence, of, ultrasound, contrast, images, a, digital, video, recorded, in, real, time, during, patient, examination, two, consecutive, signal, processing, steps, are, applied, to, each, pixel, of, the, tumor, once, signal, processing, in, each, pixel, is, completed, a, color, spatial, map, of, the, parameter, is, displayed, on, a, computer, monitor, summarizing, all, vascular, information, of, the, tumor, in, a, single, image, called, a, parametric, image, see, last, figure, of, press, article, as, clinical, examples, this, parametric, image, is, interpreted, by, clinicians, based, on, predominant, colorization, of, the, tumor, red, indicates, a, suspicion, of, malignancy, risk, of, cancer, green, or, yellow, a, high, probability, of, benignity, in, the, first, case, suspicion, of, malignant, tumor, the, clinician, typically, prescribes, a, biopsy, to, confirm, the, diagnostic, or, a, ct, scan, examination, as, a, second, opinion, in, the, second, case, quasi, certain, of, benign, tumor, only, a, follow, up, is, needed, with, a, contrast, ultrasonography, examination, a, few, months, later, the, main, clinical, benefits, are, to, avoid, a, systemic, biopsy, with, inherent, risks, of, invasive, procedures, of, benign, tumors, or, a, ct, scan, examination, exposing, the, patient, to, x, ray, radiation, the, parametric, imaging, of, vascular, signatures, method, proved, to, be, effective, in, humans, for, characterization, of, tumors, in, the, liver, in, a, cancer, screening, context, this, method, might, be, potentially, applicable, to, other, organs, such, as, breast, or, prostate, the, current, future, of, contrast, ultrasonography, is, in, molecular, imaging, with, potential, clinical, applications, expected, in, cancer, screening, to, detect, malignant, tumors, at, their, earliest, stage, of, appearance, molecular, ultrasonography, or, ultrasound, molecular, imaging, uses, targeted, microbubbles, originally, designed, by, dr, alexander, klibanov, in, 1997, such, targeted, microbubbles, specifically, bind, or, adhere, to, tumoral, microvessels, by, targeting, biomolecular, cancer, expression, overexpression, of, certain, biomolecules, that, occurs, during, neo, angiogenesis, or, inflammation, in, malignant, tumors, as, a, result, a, few, minutes, after, their, injection, in, blood, circulation, the, targeted, microbubbles, accumulate, in, the, malignant, tumor, facilitating, its, localization, in, a, unique, ultrasound, contrast, image, in, 2013, the, very, first, exploratory, clinical, trial, in, humans, for, prostate, cancer, was, completed, at, amsterdam, in, the, netherlands, by, dr, hessel, wijkstra, in, molecular, ultrasonography, the, technique, of, acoustic, radiation, force, also, used, for, shear, wave, elastography, is, applied, in, order, to, literally, push, the, targeted, microbubbles, towards, microvessels, wall, first, demonstrated, by, dr, paul, dayton, in, 1999, this, allows, maximization, of, binding, to, the, malignant, tumor, the, targeted, microbubbles, being, in, more, direct, contact, with, cancerous, biomolecules, expressed, at, the, inner, surface, of, tumoral, microvessels, at, the, stage, of, scientific, preclinical, research, the, technique, of, acoustic, radiation, force, was, implemented, as, a, prototype, in, clinical, ultrasound, systems, and, validated, in, vivo, in, 2d, and, 3d, imaging, modes, ultrasound, is, also, used, for, elastography, which, is, a, relatively, new, imaging, modality, that, maps, the, elastic, properties, of, soft, tissue, this, modality, emerged, in, the, last, two, decades, elastography, is, useful, in, medical, diagnoses, as, it, can, discern, healthy, from, unhealthy, tissue, for, specific, organs, growths, for, example, cancerous, tumors, will, often, be, harder, than, the, surrounding, tissue, and, diseased, livers, are, stiffer, than, healthy, ones, there, are, many, ultrasound, elastography, techniques, interventional, ultrasonography, involves, biopsy, emptying, fluids, intrauterine, blood, transfusion, hemolytic, disease, of, the, newborn, compression, ultrasonography, is, when, the, probe, is, pressed, against, the, skin, this, can, bring, the, target, structure, closer, to, the, probe, increasing, spatial, resolution, of, it, comparison, of, the, shape, of, the, target, structure, before, and, after, compression, can, aid, in, diagnosis, it, is, used, in, ultrasonography, of, deep, venous, thrombosis, wherein, absence, of, vein, compressibility, is, a, strong, indicator, of, thrombosis, compression, ultrasonography, has, both, high, sensitivity, and, specificity, for, detecting, proximal, deep, vein, thrombosis, in, symptomatic, patients, results, are, not, reliable, when, the, patient, is, asymptomatic, for, example, in, high, risk, postoperative, orthopedic, patients, panoramic, ultrasonography, is, the, digital, stitching, of, multiple, ultrasound, images, into, a, broader, one, it, can, display, an, entire, abnormality, and, show, its, relationship, to, nearby, structures, on, a, single, image, multiparametric, ultrasonography, mpuss, combines, multiple, ultrasound, techniques, to, produce, a, composite, result, for, example, one, study, combined, b, mode, colour, doppler, real, time, elastography, and, contrast, enhanced, ultrasound, achieving, an, accuracy, similar, to, that, of, multiparametric, mri, speed, of, sound, sos, imaging, aims, to, find, the, spatial, distribution, of, the, sos, within, the, tissue, the, idea, is, to, find, relative, delay, measurements, for, different, transmission, events, and, solve, the, limited, angle, tomographic, reconstruction, problem, using, delay, measurements, and, transmission, geometry, compared, to, shear, wave, elastography, sos, imaging, has, better, ex, vivo, tissue, differentiation, for, benign, and, malignant, tumors, as, with, all, imaging, modalities, ultrasonography, has, positive, and, negative, attributes, ultrasonography, is, generally, considered, safe, imaging, with, the, world, health, organizations, stating, diagnostic, ultrasound, studies, of, the, fetus, are, generally, considered, to, be, safe, during, pregnancy, however, this, diagnostic, procedure, should, be, performed, only, when, there, is, a, valid, medical, indication, and, the, lowest, possible, ultrasonic, exposure, setting, should, be, used, to, gain, the, necessary, diagnostic, information, under, the, as, low, as, reasonably, practicable, or, alarp, principle, although, there, is, no, evidence, that, ultrasound, could, be, harmful, to, the, fetus, medical, authorities, typically, strongly, discourage, the, promotion, selling, or, leasing, of, ultrasound, equipment, for, making, keepsake, fetal, videos, diagnostic, and, therapeutic, ultrasound, equipment, is, regulated, in, the, us, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, and, worldwide, by, other, national, regulatory, agencies, the, fda, limits, acoustic, output, using, several, metrics, generally, other, agencies, accept, the, fda, established, guidelines, currently, new, mexico, oregon, and, north, dakota, are, the, only, us, states, that, regulate, diagnostic, medical, sonographers, certification, examinations, for, sonographers, are, available, in, the, us, from, three, organizations, the, american, registry, for, diagnostic, medical, sonography, cardiovascular, credentialing, international, and, the, american, registry, of, radiologic, technologists, the, primary, regulated, metrics, are, mechanical, index, mi, a, metric, associated, with, the, cavitation, bio, effect, and, thermal, index, ti, a, metric, associated, with, the, tissue, heating, bio, effect, the, fda, requires, that, the, machine, not, exceed, established, limits, which, are, reasonably, conservative, in, an, effort, to, maintain, diagnostic, ultrasound, as, a, safe, imaging, modality, this, requires, self, regulation, on, the, part, of, the, manufacturer, in, terms, of, machine, calibration, ultrasound, based, pre, natal, care, and, sex, screening, technologies, were, launched, in, india, in, the, 1980s, with, concerns, about, its, misuse, for, sex, selective, abortion, the, government, of, india, passed, the, pre, natal, diagnostic, techniques, act, pndt, in, 1994, to, distinguish, and, regulate, legal, and, illegal, uses, of, ultrasound, equipment, the, law, was, further, amended, as, the, pre, conception, and, pre, natal, diagnostic, techniques, regulation, and, prevention, of, misuse, pcpndt, act, in, 2004, to, deter, and, punish, prenatal, sex, screening, and, sex, selective, abortion, it, is, currently, illegal, and, a, punishable, crime, in, india, to, determine, or, disclose, the, sex, of, a, fetus, using, ultrasound, equipment, ultrasound, is, also, a, valuable, tool, in, veterinary, medicine, offering, the, same, non, invasive, imaging, that, helps, in, the, diagnosis, and, monitoring, of, conditions, in, animals, after, the, french, physicist, pierre, curie, s, discovery, of, piezoelectricity, in, 1880, ultrasonic, waves, could, be, deliberately, generated, for, industry, in, 1940, the, american, acoustical, physicist, floyd, firestone, devised, the, first, ultrasonic, echo, imaging, device, the, supersonic, reflectoscope, to, detect, internal, flaws, in, metal, castings, in, 1941, austrian, neurologist, karl, theo, dussik, in, collaboration, with, his, brother, friedrich, a, physicist, was, likely, the, first, person, to, image, the, human, body, ultrasonically, outlining, the, ventricles, of, a, human, brain, ultrasonic, energy, was, first, applied, to, the, human, body, for, medical, purposes, by, dr, george, ludwig, at, the, naval, medical, research, institute, bethesda, maryland, in, the, late, 1940s, english, born, physicist, john, wild, 1914, 2009, first, used, ultrasound, to, assess, the, thickness, of, bowel, tissue, as, early, as, 1949, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, medical, ultrasound, subsequent, advances, took, place, concurrently, in, several, countries, but, was, not, until, 1961, when, david, robinson, and, george, kossoff, s, work, at, the, australian, department, of, health, resulted, in, the, first, commercially, practical, water, bath, ultrasonic, scanner, in, 1963, meyerdirk, wright, launched, production, of, the, first, commercial, hand, held, articulated, arm, compound, contact, b, mode, scanner, which, made, ultrasound, generally, available, for, medical, use, l, andre, pourcelot, a, researcher, and, teacher, at, insa, institut, national, des, sciences, appliqu, es, lyon, co, published, a, report, in, 1965, at, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, effet, doppler, et, mesure, du, d, bit, sanguin, doppler, effect, and, measure, of, the, blood, flow, the, basis, of, his, design, of, a, doppler, flow, meter, in, 1967, parallel, developments, in, glasgow, scotland, by, professor, ian, donald, and, colleagues, at, the, glasgow, royal, maternity, hospital, grmh, led, to, the, first, diagnostic, applications, of, the, technique, donald, was, an, obstetrician, with, a, self, confessed, childish, interest, in, machines, electronic, and, otherwise, who, having, treated, the, wife, of, one, of, the, company, s, directors, was, invited, to, visit, the, research, department, of, boilermakers, babcock, wilcox, at, renfrew, he, adapted, their, industrial, ultrasound, equipment, to, conduct, experiments, on, various, anatomical, specimens, and, assess, their, ultrasonic, characteristics, together, with, the, medical, physicist, tom, brown, and, fellow, obstetrician, john, macvicar, donald, refined, the, equipment, to, enable, differentiation, of, pathology, in, live, volunteer, patients, these, findings, were, reported, in, the, lancet, on, 7, june, 1958, as, investigation, of, abdominal, masses, by, pulsed, ultrasound, possibly, one, of, the, most, important, papers, published, in, the, field, of, diagnostic, medical, imaging, at, grmh, professor, donald, and, james, willocks, then, refined, their, techniques, to, obstetric, applications, including, fetal, head, measurement, to, assess, the, size, and, growth, of, the, fetus, with, the, opening, of, the, new, queen, mother, s, hospital, in, yorkhill, in, 1964, it, became, possible, to, improve, these, methods, even, further, stuart, campbell, s, pioneering, work, on, fetal, cephalometry, led, to, it, acquiring, long, term, status, as, the, definitive, method, of, study, of, foetal, growth, as, the, technical, quality, of, the, scans, was, further, developed, it, soon, became, possible, to, study, pregnancy, from, start, to, finish, and, diagnose, its, many, complications, such, as, multiple, pregnancy, fetal, abnormality, and, placenta, praevia, diagnostic, ultrasound, has, since, been, imported, into, practically, every, other, area, of, medicine, medical, ultrasonography, was, used, in, 1953, at, lund, university, by, cardiologist, inge, edler, and, gustav, ludwig, hertz, s, son, carl, hellmuth, hertz, who, was, then, a, graduate, student, at, the, university, s, department, of, nuclear, physics, edler, had, asked, hertz, if, it, was, possible, to, use, radar, to, look, into, the, body, but, hertz, said, this, was, impossible, however, he, said, it, might, be, possible, to, use, ultrasonography, hertz, was, familiar, with, using, ultrasonic, reflectoscopes, of, the, american, acoustical, physicist, floyd, firestone, s, invention, for, nondestructive, materials, testing, and, together, edler, and, hertz, developed, the, idea, of, applying, this, methodology, in, medicine, the, first, successful, measurement, of, heart, activity, was, made, on, october, 29, 1953, using, a, device, borrowed, from, the, ship, construction, company, kockums, in, malm, on, december, 16, the, same, year, the, method, was, applied, to, generate, an, echo, encephalogram, ultrasonic, probe, of, the, brain, edler, and, hertz, published, their, findings, in, 1954, in, 1962, after, about, two, years, of, work, joseph, holmes, william, wright, and, ralph, meyerdirk, developed, the, first, compound, contact, b, mode, scanner, their, work, had, been, supported, by, u, s, public, health, services, and, the, university, of, colorado, wright, and, meyerdirk, left, the, university, to, form, physionic, engineering, inc, which, launched, the, first, commercial, hand, held, articulated, arm, compound, contact, b, mode, scanner, in, 1963, this, was, the, start, of, the, most, popular, design, in, the, history, of, ultrasound, scanners, in, the, late, 1960s, gene, strandness, and, the, bio, engineering, group, at, the, university, of, washington, conducted, research, on, doppler, ultrasound, as, a, diagnostic, tool, for, vascular, disease, eventually, they, developed, technologies, to, use, duplex, imaging, or, doppler, in, conjunction, with, b, mode, scanning, to, view, vascular, structures, in, real, time, while, also, providing, hemodynamic, information, the, first, demonstration, of, color, doppler, was, by, geoff, stevenson, who, was, involved, in, the, early, developments, and, medical, use, of, doppler, shifted, ultrasonic, energy, major, manufacturers, of, medical, ultrasound, devices, and, equipment, are
