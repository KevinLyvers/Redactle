the, cavity, magnetron, is, a, high, power, vacuum, tube, used, in, early, radar, systems, and, subsequently, in, microwave, ovens, and, in, linear, particle, accelerators, a, cavity, magnetron, generates, microwaves, using, the, interaction, of, a, stream, of, electrons, with, a, magnetic, field, while, moving, past, a, series, of, cavity, resonators, which, are, small, open, cavities, in, a, metal, block, electrons, pass, by, the, cavities, and, cause, microwaves, to, oscillate, within, similar, to, the, functioning, of, a, whistle, producing, a, tone, when, excited, by, an, air, stream, blown, past, its, opening, the, resonant, frequency, of, the, arrangement, is, determined, by, the, cavities, physical, dimensions, unlike, other, vacuum, tubes, such, as, a, klystron, or, a, traveling, wave, tube, twt, the, magnetron, cannot, function, as, an, amplifier, for, increasing, the, intensity, of, an, applied, microwave, signal, the, magnetron, serves, solely, as, an, electronic, oscillator, generating, a, microwave, signal, from, direct, current, electricity, supplied, to, the, vacuum, tube, the, use, of, magnetic, fields, as, a, means, to, control, the, flow, of, an, electric, current, was, spurred, by, the, invention, of, the, audion, by, lee, de, forest, in, 1906, albert, hull, of, general, electric, research, laboratory, usa, began, development, of, magnetrons, to, avoid, de, forest, s, patents, but, these, were, never, completely, successful, other, experimenters, picked, up, on, hull, s, work, and, a, key, advance, the, use, of, two, cathodes, was, introduced, by, habann, in, germany, in, 1924, further, research, was, limited, until, okabe, s, 1929, japanese, paper, noting, the, production, of, centimeter, wavelength, signals, which, led, to, worldwide, interest, the, development, of, magnetrons, with, multiple, cathodes, was, proposed, by, a, l, samuel, of, bell, telephone, laboratories, in, 1934, leading, to, designs, by, postumus, in, 1934, and, hans, hollmann, in, 1935, production, was, taken, up, by, philips, general, electric, company, gec, telefunken, and, others, limited, to, perhaps, 10, w, output, by, this, time, the, klystron, was, producing, more, power, and, the, magnetron, was, not, widely, used, although, a, 300w, device, was, built, by, aleksereff, and, malearoff, in, the, ussr, in, 1936, published, in, 1940, the, cavity, magnetron, was, a, radical, improvement, introduced, by, john, randall, and, harry, boot, at, the, university, of, birmingham, england, in, 1940, 24, 26, their, first, working, example, produced, hundreds, of, watts, at, 10, cm, wavelength, an, unprecedented, achievement, within, weeks, engineers, at, gec, had, improved, this, to, well, over, a, kilowatt, and, within, months, 25, kilowatts, over, 100, kw, by, 1941, and, pushing, towards, a, megawatt, by, 1943, the, high, power, pulses, were, generated, from, a, device, the, size, of, a, small, book, and, transmitted, from, an, antenna, only, centimeters, long, reducing, the, size, of, practical, radar, systems, by, orders, of, magnitude, new, radars, appeared, for, night, fighters, anti, submarine, aircraft, and, even, the, smallest, escort, ships, and, from, that, point, on, the, allies, of, world, war, ii, held, a, lead, in, radar, that, their, counterparts, in, germany, and, japan, were, never, able, to, close, by, the, end, of, the, war, practically, every, allied, radar, was, based, on, the, magnetron, the, magnetron, continued, to, be, used, in, radar, in, the, post, war, period, but, fell, from, favour, in, the, 1960s, as, high, power, klystrons, and, traveling, wave, tubes, emerged, a, key, characteristic, of, the, magnetron, is, that, its, output, signal, changes, from, pulse, to, pulse, both, in, frequency, and, phase, this, renders, it, less, suitable, for, pulse, to, pulse, comparisons, for, performing, moving, target, indication, and, removing, clutter, from, the, radar, display, the, magnetron, remains, in, use, in, some, radar, systems, but, has, become, much, more, common, as, a, low, cost, source, for, microwave, ovens, in, this, form, over, one, billion, magnetrons, are, in, use, today, in, a, conventional, electron, tube, vacuum, tube, electrons, are, emitted, from, a, negatively, charged, heated, component, called, the, cathode, and, are, attracted, to, a, positively, charged, component, called, the, anode, the, components, are, normally, arranged, concentrically, placed, within, a, tubular, shaped, container, from, which, all, air, has, been, evacuated, so, that, the, electrons, can, move, freely, hence, the, name, vacuum, tubes, called, valves, in, british, english, if, a, third, electrode, called, a, control, grid, is, inserted, between, the, cathode, and, the, anode, the, flow, of, electrons, between, the, cathode, and, anode, can, be, regulated, by, varying, the, voltage, on, this, third, electrode, this, allows, the, resulting, electron, tube, called, a, triode, because, it, now, has, three, electrodes, to, function, as, an, amplifier, because, small, variations, in, the, electric, charge, applied, to, the, control, grid, will, result, in, identical, variations, in, the, much, larger, current, of, electrons, flowing, between, the, cathode, and, anode, the, idea, of, using, a, grid, for, control, was, invented, by, philipp, lenard, who, received, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, 1905, in, the, usa, it, was, later, patented, by, lee, de, forest, resulting, in, considerable, research, into, alternate, tube, designs, that, would, avoid, his, patents, one, concept, used, a, magnetic, field, instead, of, an, electrical, charge, to, control, current, flow, leading, to, the, development, of, the, magnetron, tube, in, this, design, the, tube, was, made, with, two, electrodes, typically, with, the, cathode, in, the, form, of, a, metal, rod, in, the, center, and, the, anode, as, a, cylinder, around, it, the, tube, was, placed, between, the, poles, of, a, horseshoe, magnet, arranged, such, that, the, magnetic, field, was, aligned, parallel, to, the, axis, of, the, electrodes, with, no, magnetic, field, present, the, tube, operates, as, a, diode, with, electrons, flowing, directly, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, in, the, presence, of, the, magnetic, field, the, electrons, will, experience, a, force, at, right, angles, to, their, direction, of, motion, the, lorentz, force, in, this, case, the, electrons, follow, a, curved, path, between, the, cathode, and, anode, the, curvature, of, the, path, can, be, controlled, by, varying, either, the, magnetic, field, using, an, electromagnet, or, by, changing, the, electrical, potential, between, the, electrodes, at, very, high, magnetic, field, settings, the, electrons, are, forced, back, onto, the, cathode, preventing, current, flow, at, the, opposite, extreme, with, no, field, the, electrons, are, free, to, flow, straight, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, there, is, a, point, between, the, two, extremes, the, critical, value, or, hull, cut, off, magnetic, field, and, cut, off, voltage, where, the, electrons, just, reach, the, anode, at, fields, around, this, point, the, device, operates, similar, to, a, triode, however, magnetic, control, due, to, hysteresis, and, other, effects, results, in, a, slower, and, less, faithful, response, to, control, current, than, electrostatic, control, using, a, control, grid, in, a, conventional, triode, not, to, mention, greater, weight, and, complexity, so, magnetrons, saw, limited, use, in, conventional, electronic, designs, it, was, noticed, that, when, the, magnetron, was, operating, at, the, critical, value, it, would, emit, energy, in, the, radio, frequency, spectrum, this, occurs, because, a, few, of, the, electrons, instead, of, reaching, the, anode, continue, to, circle, in, the, space, between, the, cathode, and, the, anode, due, to, an, effect, now, known, as, cyclotron, radiation, these, electrons, radiate, radio, frequency, energy, the, effect, is, not, very, efficient, eventually, the, electrons, hit, one, of, the, electrodes, so, the, number, in, the, circulating, state, at, any, given, time, is, a, small, percentage, of, the, overall, current, it, was, also, noticed, that, the, frequency, of, the, radiation, depends, on, the, size, of, the, tube, and, even, early, examples, were, built, that, produced, signals, in, the, microwave, regime, early, conventional, tube, systems, were, limited, to, the, high, frequency, bands, and, although, very, high, frequency, systems, became, widely, available, in, the, late, 1930s, the, ultra, high, frequency, and, microwave, bands, were, well, beyond, the, ability, of, conventional, circuits, the, magnetron, was, one, of, the, few, devices, able, to, generate, signals, in, the, microwave, band, and, it, was, the, only, one, that, was, able, to, produce, high, power, at, centimeter, wavelengths, the, original, magnetron, was, very, difficult, to, keep, operating, at, the, critical, value, and, even, then, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, circling, state, at, any, time, was, fairly, low, this, meant, that, it, produced, very, low, power, signals, nevertheless, as, one, of, the, few, devices, known, to, create, microwaves, interest, in, the, device, and, potential, improvements, was, widespread, the, first, major, improvement, was, the, split, anode, magnetron, also, known, as, a, negative, resistance, magnetron, as, the, name, implies, this, design, used, an, anode, that, was, split, in, two, one, at, each, end, of, the, tube, creating, two, half, cylinders, when, both, were, charged, to, the, same, voltage, the, system, worked, like, the, original, model, but, by, slightly, altering, the, voltage, of, the, two, plates, the, electrons, trajectory, could, be, modified, so, that, they, would, naturally, travel, towards, the, lower, voltage, side, the, plates, were, connected, to, an, oscillator, that, reversed, the, relative, voltage, of, the, two, plates, at, a, given, frequency, at, any, given, instant, the, electron, will, naturally, be, pushed, towards, the, lower, voltage, side, of, the, tube, the, electron, will, then, oscillate, back, and, forth, as, the, voltage, changes, at, the, same, time, a, strong, magnetic, field, is, applied, stronger, than, the, critical, value, in, the, original, design, this, would, normally, cause, the, electron, to, circle, back, to, the, cathode, but, due, to, the, oscillating, electrical, field, the, electron, instead, follows, a, looping, path, that, continues, toward, the, anodes, since, all, of, the, electrons, in, the, flow, experienced, this, looping, motion, the, amount, of, rf, energy, being, radiated, was, greatly, improved, and, as, the, motion, occurred, at, any, field, level, beyond, the, critical, value, it, was, no, longer, necessary, to, carefully, tune, the, fields, and, voltages, and, the, overall, stability, of, the, device, was, greatly, improved, unfortunately, the, higher, field, also, meant, that, electrons, often, circled, back, to, the, cathode, depositing, their, energy, on, it, and, causing, it, to, heat, up, as, this, normally, causes, more, electrons, to, be, released, it, could, sometimes, lead, to, a, runaway, effect, damaging, the, device, the, great, advance, in, magnetron, design, was, the, resonant, cavity, magnetron, or, electron, resonance, magnetron, which, works, on, entirely, different, principles, in, this, design, the, oscillation, is, created, by, the, physical, shape, of, the, anode, rather, than, external, circuits, or, fields, mechanically, the, cavity, magnetron, consists, of, a, large, solid, cylinder, of, metal, with, a, hole, drilled, through, the, centre, of, the, circular, face, a, wire, acting, as, the, cathode, is, run, down, the, center, of, this, hole, and, the, metal, block, itself, forms, the, anode, around, this, hole, known, as, the, interaction, space, are, a, number, of, similar, holes, resonators, drilled, parallel, to, the, interaction, space, connected, to, the, interaction, space, by, a, short, channel, the, resulting, block, looks, something, like, the, cylinder, on, a, revolver, with, a, somewhat, larger, central, hole, early, models, were, cut, using, colt, pistol, jigs, remembering, that, in, an, ac, circuit, the, electrons, travel, along, the, surface, not, the, core, of, the, conductor, the, parallel, sides, of, the, slot, acts, as, a, capacitor, while, the, round, holes, form, an, inductor, an, lc, circuit, made, of, solid, copper, with, the, resonant, frequency, defined, entirely, by, its, dimensions, the, magnetic, field, is, set, to, a, value, well, below, the, critical, so, the, electrons, follow, arcing, paths, towards, the, anode, when, they, strike, the, anode, they, cause, it, to, become, negatively, charged, in, that, region, as, this, process, is, random, some, areas, will, become, more, or, less, charged, than, the, areas, around, them, the, anode, is, constructed, of, a, highly, conductive, material, almost, always, copper, so, these, differences, in, voltage, cause, currents, to, appear, to, even, them, out, since, the, current, has, to, flow, around, the, outside, of, the, cavity, this, process, takes, time, during, that, time, additional, electrons, will, avoid, the, hot, spots, and, be, deposited, further, along, the, anode, as, the, additional, current, flowing, around, it, arrives, too, this, causes, an, oscillating, current, to, form, as, the, current, tries, to, equalize, one, spot, then, another, the, oscillating, currents, flowing, around, the, cavities, and, their, effect, on, the, electron, flow, within, the, tube, cause, large, amounts, of, microwave, radiofrequency, energy, to, be, generated, in, the, cavities, the, cavities, are, open, on, one, end, so, the, entire, mechanism, forms, a, single, larger, microwave, oscillator, a, tap, normally, a, wire, formed, into, a, loop, extracts, microwave, energy, from, one, of, the, cavities, in, some, systems, the, tap, wire, is, replaced, by, an, open, hole, which, allows, the, microwaves, to, flow, into, a, waveguide, as, the, oscillation, takes, some, time, to, set, up, and, is, inherently, random, at, the, start, subsequent, startups, will, have, different, output, parameters, phase, is, almost, never, preserved, which, makes, the, magnetron, difficult, to, use, in, phased, array, systems, frequency, also, drifts, from, pulse, to, pulse, a, more, difficult, problem, for, a, wider, array, of, radar, systems, neither, of, these, present, a, problem, for, continuous, wave, radars, nor, for, microwave, ovens, all, cavity, magnetrons, consist, of, a, heated, cylindrical, cathode, at, a, high, continuous, or, pulsed, negative, potential, created, by, a, high, voltage, direct, current, power, supply, the, cathode, is, placed, in, the, center, of, an, evacuated, lobed, circular, metal, chamber, the, walls, of, the, chamber, are, the, anode, of, the, tube, a, magnetic, field, parallel, to, the, axis, of, the, cavity, is, imposed, by, a, permanent, magnet, the, electrons, initially, move, radially, outward, from, the, cathode, attracted, by, the, electric, field, of, the, anode, walls, the, magnetic, field, causes, the, electrons, to, spiral, outward, in, a, circular, path, a, consequence, of, the, lorentz, force, spaced, around, the, rim, of, the, chamber, are, cylindrical, cavities, slots, are, cut, along, the, length, of, the, cavities, that, open, into, the, central, common, cavity, space, as, electrons, sweep, past, these, slots, they, induce, a, high, frequency, radio, field, in, each, resonant, cavity, which, in, turn, causes, the, electrons, to, bunch, into, groups, a, portion, of, the, radio, frequency, energy, is, extracted, by, a, short, coupling, loop, that, is, connected, to, a, waveguide, a, metal, tube, usually, of, rectangular, cross, section, the, waveguide, directs, the, extracted, rf, energy, to, the, load, which, may, be, a, cooking, chamber, in, a, microwave, oven, or, a, high, gain, antenna, in, the, case, of, radar, the, sizes, of, the, cavities, determine, the, resonant, frequency, and, thereby, the, frequency, of, the, emitted, microwaves, however, the, frequency, is, not, precisely, controllable, the, operating, frequency, varies, with, changes, in, load, impedance, with, changes, in, the, supply, current, and, with, the, temperature, of, the, tube, this, is, not, a, problem, in, uses, such, as, heating, or, in, some, forms, of, radar, where, the, receiver, can, be, synchronized, with, an, imprecise, magnetron, frequency, where, precise, frequencies, are, needed, other, devices, such, as, the, klystron, are, used, the, magnetron, is, a, self, oscillating, device, requiring, no, external, elements, other, than, a, power, supply, a, well, defined, threshold, anode, voltage, must, be, applied, before, oscillation, will, build, up, this, voltage, is, a, function, of, the, dimensions, of, the, resonant, cavity, and, the, applied, magnetic, field, in, pulsed, applications, there, is, a, delay, of, several, cycles, before, the, oscillator, achieves, full, peak, power, and, the, build, up, of, anode, voltage, must, be, coordinated, with, the, build, up, of, oscillator, output, where, there, are, an, even, number, of, cavities, two, concentric, rings, can, connect, alternate, cavity, walls, to, prevent, inefficient, modes, of, oscillation, this, is, called, pi, strapping, because, the, two, straps, lock, the, phase, difference, between, adjacent, cavities, at, radians, 180, the, modern, magnetron, is, a, fairly, efficient, device, in, a, microwave, oven, for, instance, a, 1, 1, kilowatt, input, will, generally, create, about, 700, watts, of, microwave, power, an, efficiency, of, around, 65, the, high, voltage, and, the, properties, of, the, cathode, determine, the, power, of, a, magnetron, large, s, band, magnetrons, can, produce, up, to, 2, 5, megawatts, peak, power, with, an, average, power, of, 3, 75, kw, some, large, magnetrons, are, water, cooled, the, magnetron, remains, in, widespread, use, in, roles, which, require, high, power, but, where, precise, control, over, frequency, and, phase, is, unimportant, in, a, radar, set, the, magnetron, s, waveguide, is, connected, to, an, antenna, the, magnetron, is, operated, with, very, short, pulses, of, applied, voltage, resulting, in, a, short, pulse, of, high, power, microwave, energy, being, radiated, as, in, all, primary, radar, systems, the, radiation, reflected, from, a, target, is, analyzed, to, produce, a, radar, map, on, a, screen, several, characteristics, of, the, magnetron, s, output, make, radar, use, of, the, device, somewhat, problematic, the, first, of, these, factors, is, the, magnetron, s, inherent, instability, in, its, transmitter, frequency, this, instability, results, not, only, in, frequency, shifts, from, one, pulse, to, the, next, but, also, a, frequency, shift, within, an, individual, transmitted, pulse, the, second, factor, is, that, the, energy, of, the, transmitted, pulse, is, spread, over, a, relatively, wide, frequency, spectrum, which, requires, the, receiver, to, have, a, correspondingly, wide, bandwidth, this, wide, bandwidth, allows, ambient, electrical, noise, to, be, accepted, into, the, receiver, thus, obscuring, somewhat, the, weak, radar, echoes, thereby, reducing, overall, receiver, signal, to, noise, ratio, and, thus, performance, the, third, factor, depending, on, application, is, the, radiation, hazard, caused, by, the, use, of, high, power, electromagnetic, radiation, in, some, applications, for, example, a, marine, radar, mounted, on, a, recreational, vessel, a, radar, with, a, magnetron, output, of, 2, to, 4, kilowatts, is, often, found, mounted, very, near, an, area, occupied, by, crew, or, passengers, in, practical, use, these, factors, have, been, overcome, or, merely, accepted, and, there, are, today, thousands, of, magnetron, aviation, and, marine, radar, units, in, service, recent, advances, in, aviation, weather, avoidance, radar, and, in, marine, radar, have, successfully, replaced, the, magnetron, with, microwave, semiconductor, oscillators, which, have, a, narrower, output, frequency, range, these, allow, a, narrower, receiver, bandwidth, to, be, used, and, the, higher, signal, to, noise, ratio, in, turn, allows, a, lower, transmitter, power, reducing, exposure, to, emr, in, microwave, ovens, the, waveguide, leads, to, a, radio, frequency, transparent, port, into, the, cooking, chamber, as, the, fixed, dimensions, of, the, chamber, and, its, physical, closeness, to, the, magnetron, would, normally, create, standing, wave, patterns, in, the, chamber, the, pattern, is, randomized, by, a, motorized, fan, like, mode, stirrer, in, the, waveguide, more, often, in, commercial, ovens, or, by, a, turntable, that, rotates, the, food, most, common, in, consumer, ovens, an, early, example, of, this, application, was, when, british, scientists, in, 1954, used, a, microwave, oven, to, resurrect, cryogenically, frozen, hamsters, in, microwave, excited, lighting, systems, such, as, a, sulfur, lamp, a, magnetron, provides, the, microwave, field, that, is, passed, through, a, waveguide, to, the, lighting, cavity, containing, the, light, emitting, substance, e, g, sulfur, metal, halides, etc, although, efficient, these, lamps, are, much, more, complex, than, other, methods, of, lighting, and, therefore, not, commonly, used, more, modern, variants, use, hemts, or, gan, on, sic, power, semiconductor, devices, to, generate, the, microwaves, which, are, substantially, less, complex, and, can, be, adjusted, to, maximize, light, output, using, a, pid, controller, in, 1910, hans, gerdien, 1877, 1951, of, the, siemens, corporation, invented, a, magnetron, in, 1912, swiss, physicist, heinrich, greinacher, was, looking, for, new, ways, to, calculate, the, electron, mass, he, settled, on, a, system, consisting, of, a, diode, with, a, cylindrical, anode, surrounding, a, rod, shaped, cathode, placed, in, the, middle, of, a, magnet, the, attempt, to, measure, the, electron, mass, failed, because, he, was, unable, to, achieve, a, good, vacuum, in, the, tube, however, as, part, of, this, work, greinacher, developed, mathematical, models, of, the, motion, of, the, electrons, in, the, crossed, magnetic, and, electric, fields, in, the, us, albert, hull, put, this, work, to, use, in, an, attempt, to, bypass, western, electric, s, patents, on, the, triode, western, electric, had, gained, control, of, this, design, by, buying, lee, de, forest, s, patents, on, the, control, of, current, flow, using, electric, fields, via, the, grid, hull, intended, to, use, a, variable, magnetic, field, instead, of, an, electrostatic, one, to, control, the, flow, of, the, electrons, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, working, at, general, electric, s, research, laboratories, in, schenectady, new, york, hull, built, tubes, that, provided, switching, through, the, control, of, the, ratio, of, the, magnetic, and, electric, field, strengths, he, released, several, papers, and, patents, on, the, concept, in, 1921, hull, s, magnetron, was, not, originally, intended, to, generate, vhf, very, high, frequency, electromagnetic, waves, however, in, 1924, czech, physicist, august, ek, 1886, 1961, and, german, physicist, erich, habann, 1892, 1968, independently, discovered, that, the, magnetron, could, generate, waves, of, 100, megahertz, to, 1, gigahertz, ek, a, professor, at, prague, s, charles, university, published, first, however, he, published, in, a, journal, with, a, small, circulation, and, thus, attracted, little, attention, habann, a, student, at, the, university, of, jena, investigated, the, magnetron, for, his, doctoral, dissertation, of, 1924, throughout, the, 1920s, hull, and, other, researchers, around, the, world, worked, to, develop, the, magnetron, most, of, these, early, magnetrons, were, glass, vacuum, tubes, with, multiple, anodes, however, the, two, pole, magnetron, also, known, as, a, split, anode, magnetron, had, relatively, low, efficiency, while, radar, was, being, developed, during, world, war, ii, there, arose, an, urgent, need, for, a, high, power, microwave, generator, that, worked, at, shorter, wavelengths, around, 10, cm, 3, ghz, rather, than, the, 50, to, 150, cm, 200, mhz, that, was, available, from, tube, based, generators, of, the, time, it, was, known, that, a, multi, cavity, resonant, magnetron, had, been, developed, and, patented, in, 1935, by, hans, hollmann, in, berlin, however, the, german, military, considered, the, frequency, drift, of, hollman, s, device, to, be, undesirable, and, based, their, radar, systems, on, the, klystron, instead, but, klystrons, could, not, at, that, time, achieve, the, high, power, output, that, magnetrons, eventually, reached, this, was, one, reason, that, german, night, fighter, radars, which, never, strayed, beyond, the, low, uhf, band, to, start, with, for, front, line, aircraft, were, not, a, match, for, their, british, counterparts, 229, likewise, in, the, uk, albert, beaumont, wood, proposed, in, 1937, a, system, with, six, or, eight, small, holes, drilled, in, a, metal, block, differing, from, the, later, production, designs, only, in, the, aspects, of, vacuum, sealing, however, his, idea, was, rejected, by, the, navy, who, said, their, valve, department, was, far, too, busy, to, consider, it, in, 1940, at, the, university, of, birmingham, in, the, uk, john, randall, and, harry, boot, produced, a, working, prototype, of, a, cavity, magnetron, that, produced, about, 400, w, within, a, week, this, had, improved, to, 1, kw, and, within, the, next, few, months, with, the, addition, of, water, cooling, and, many, detail, changes, this, had, improved, to, 10, and, then, 25, kw, to, deal, with, its, drifting, frequency, they, sampled, the, output, signal, and, synchronized, their, receiver, to, whatever, frequency, was, actually, being, generated, in, 1941, the, problem, of, frequency, instability, was, solved, by, james, sayers, coupling, strapping, alternate, cavities, within, the, magnetron, which, reduced, the, instability, by, a, factor, of, 5, 6, for, an, overview, of, early, magnetron, designs, including, that, of, boot, and, randall, see, gec, at, wembley, made, 12, prototype, cavity, magnetrons, in, august, 1940, and, no, 12, was, sent, to, america, with, bowen, on, the, tizard, mission, where, it, was, shown, on, 19, september, 1940, in, alfred, loomis, apartment, the, american, ndrc, microwave, committee, was, stunned, at, the, power, level, produced, however, bell, labs, director, was, upset, when, it, was, x, rayed, and, had, eight, holes, rather, than, the, six, holes, shown, on, the, gec, plans, after, contacting, via, the, transatlantic, cable, dr, eric, megaw, gec, s, vacuum, tube, expert, megaw, recalled, that, when, he, had, asked, for, 12, prototypes, he, said, make, 10, with, 6, holes, one, with, 7, and, one, with, 8, there, was, no, time, to, amend, the, drawings, and, no, 12, with, 8, holes, was, chosen, for, the, tizard, mission, so, bell, labs, chose, to, copy, the, sample, and, while, early, british, magnetrons, had, six, cavities, the, american, ones, had, eight, cavities, according, to, andy, manning, from, the, raf, air, defence, radar, museum, randall, and, boot, s, discovery, was, a, massive, massive, breakthrough, and, deemed, by, many, even, now, to, be, the, most, important, invention, that, came, out, of, the, second, world, war, while, professor, of, military, history, at, the, university, of, victoria, in, british, columbia, david, zimmerman, states, the, magnetron, remains, the, essential, radio, tube, for, shortwave, radio, signals, of, all, types, it, not, only, changed, the, course, of, the, war, by, allowing, us, to, develop, airborne, radar, systems, it, remains, the, key, piece, of, technology, that, lies, at, the, heart, of, your, microwave, oven, today, the, cavity, magnetron, s, invention, changed, the, world, because, france, had, just, fallen, to, the, nazis, and, britain, had, no, money, to, develop, the, magnetron, on, a, massive, scale, winston, churchill, agreed, that, sir, henry, tizard, should, offer, the, magnetron, to, the, americans, in, exchange, for, their, financial, and, industrial, help, an, early, 10, kw, version, built, in, england, by, the, general, electric, company, research, laboratories, in, wembley, london, was, taken, on, the, tizard, mission, in, september, 1940, as, the, discussion, turned, to, radar, the, us, navy, representatives, began, to, detail, the, problems, with, their, short, wavelength, systems, complaining, that, their, klystrons, could, only, produce, 10, w, with, a, flourish, taffy, bowen, pulled, out, a, magnetron, and, explained, it, produced, 1000, times, that, bell, telephone, laboratories, took, the, example, and, quickly, began, making, copies, and, before, the, end, of, 1940, the, radiation, laboratory, had, been, set, up, on, the, campus, of, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, to, develop, various, types, of, radar, using, the, magnetron, by, early, 1941, portable, centimetric, airborne, radars, were, being, tested, in, american, and, british, aircraft, in, late, 1941, the, telecommunications, research, establishment, in, the, united, kingdom, used, the, magnetron, to, develop, a, revolutionary, airborne, ground, mapping, radar, codenamed, h2s, the, h2s, radar, was, in, part, developed, by, alan, blumlein, and, bernard, lovell, the, cavity, magnetron, was, widely, used, during, world, war, ii, in, microwave, radar, equipment, and, is, often, credited, with, giving, allied, radar, a, considerable, performance, advantage, over, german, and, japanese, radars, thus, directly, influencing, the, outcome, of, the, war, it, was, later, described, by, american, historian, james, phinney, baxter, iii, as, he, most, valuable, cargo, ever, brought, to, our, shores, centimetric, radar, made, possible, by, the, cavity, magnetron, allowed, for, the, detection, of, much, smaller, objects, and, the, use, of, much, smaller, antennas, the, combination, of, small, cavity, magnetrons, small, antennas, and, high, resolution, allowed, small, high, quality, radars, to, be, installed, in, aircraft, they, could, be, used, by, maritime, patrol, aircraft, to, detect, objects, as, small, as, a, submarine, periscope, which, allowed, aircraft, to, attack, and, destroy, submerged, submarines, which, had, previously, been, undetectable, from, the, air, centimetric, contour, mapping, radars, like, h2s, improved, the, accuracy, of, allied, bombers, used, in, the, strategic, bombing, campaign, despite, the, existence, of, the, german, fug, 350, naxos, device, to, specifically, detect, it, centimetric, gun, laying, radars, were, likewise, far, more, accurate, than, the, older, technology, they, made, the, big, gunned, allied, battleships, more, deadly, and, along, with, the, newly, developed, proximity, fuze, made, anti, aircraft, guns, much, more, dangerous, to, attacking, aircraft, the, two, coupled, together, and, used, by, anti, aircraft, batteries, placed, along, the, flight, path, of, german, v, 1, flying, bombs, on, their, way, to, london, are, credited, with, destroying, many, of, the, flying, bombs, before, they, reached, their, target, since, then, many, millions, of, cavity, magnetrons, have, been, manufactured, while, some, have, been, for, radar, the, vast, majority, have, been, for, microwave, ovens, the, use, in, radar, itself, has, dwindled, to, some, extent, as, more, accurate, signals, have, generally, been, needed, and, developers, have, moved, to, klystron, and, traveling, wave, tube, systems, for, these, needs, at, least, one, hazard, in, particular, is, well, known, and, documented, as, the, lens, of, the, eye, has, no, cooling, blood, flow, it, is, particularly, prone, to, overheating, when, exposed, to, microwave, radiation, this, heating, can, in, turn, lead, to, a, higher, incidence, of, cataracts, in, later, life, there, is, also, a, considerable, electrical, hazard, around, magnetrons, as, they, require, a, high, voltage, power, supply, most, magnetrons, contain, a, small, amount, of, beryllium, oxide, and, thorium, mixed, with, tungsten, in, their, filament, exceptions, to, this, are, higher, power, magnetrons, that, operate, above, approximately, 10, 000, volts, where, positive, ion, bombardment, becomes, damaging, to, thorium, metal, hence, pure, tungsten, potassium, doped, is, used, while, thorium, is, a, radioactive, metal, the, risk, of, cancer, is, low, as, it, never, gets, airborne, in, normal, usage, only, if, the, filament, is, taken, out, of, the, magnetron, finely, crushed, and, inhaled, can, it, pose, a, health, hazard
