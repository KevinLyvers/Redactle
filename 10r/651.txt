knitting, is, a, method, for, production, of, textile, fabrics, by, interlacing, yarn, loops, with, loops, of, the, same, or, other, yarns, it, is, used, to, create, many, types, of, garments, knitting, may, be, done, by, hand, or, by, machine, knitting, creates, stitches, loops, of, yarn, in, a, row, they, can, be, either, on, straight, flat, needles, or, in, the, round, on, needles, with, often, times, plastic, tubes, connected, to, both, ends, of, the, needles, there, are, usually, many, active, stitches, on, the, knitting, needle, at, one, time, knitted, fabric, consists, of, a, number, of, consecutive, rows, of, connected, loops, that, intermesh, with, the, next, and, previous, rows, as, each, row, is, formed, each, newly, created, loop, is, pulled, through, one, or, more, loops, from, the, prior, row, and, placed, on, the, gaining, needle, so, that, the, loops, from, the, prior, row, can, be, pulled, off, the, other, needle, without, unraveling, differences, in, yarn, varying, in, fibre, type, weight, uniformity, and, twist, needle, size, and, stitch, type, allow, for, a, variety, of, knitted, fabrics, with, different, properties, including, color, texture, thickness, heat, retention, water, resistance, and, integrity, a, small, sample, of, knitwork, is, known, as, a, swatch, like, weaving, knitting, is, a, technique, for, producing, a, two, dimensional, fabric, made, from, a, one, dimensional, yarn, or, thread, in, weaving, threads, are, always, straight, running, parallel, either, lengthwise, warp, threads, or, crosswise, weft, threads, by, contrast, the, yarn, in, knitted, fabrics, follows, a, meandering, path, a, course, forming, symmetric, loops, also, called, bights, symmetrically, above, and, below, the, mean, path, of, the, yarn, these, meandering, loops, can, be, easily, stretched, in, different, directions, giving, knit, fabrics, much, more, elasticity, than, woven, fabrics, depending, on, the, yarn, and, knitting, pattern, knitted, garments, can, stretch, as, much, as, 500, for, this, reason, knitting, was, initially, developed, for, garments, that, must, be, elastic, or, stretch, in, response, to, the, wearer, s, motions, such, as, socks, and, hosiery, for, comparison, woven, garments, stretch, mainly, along, one, or, other, of, a, related, pair, of, directions, that, lie, roughly, diagonally, between, the, warp, and, the, weft, while, contracting, in, the, other, direction, of, the, pair, stretching, and, contracting, with, the, bias, and, are, not, very, elastic, unless, they, are, woven, from, stretchable, material, such, as, spandex, knitted, garments, are, often, more, form, fitting, than, woven, garments, since, their, elasticity, allows, them, to, contour, to, the, body, s, outline, more, closely, by, contrast, curvature, is, introduced, into, most, woven, garments, only, with, sewn, darts, flares, gussets, and, gores, the, seams, of, which, lower, the, elasticity, of, the, woven, fabric, still, further, extra, curvature, can, be, introduced, into, knitted, garments, without, seams, as, in, the, heel, of, a, sock, the, effect, of, darts, flares, etc, can, be, obtained, with, short, rows, or, by, increasing, or, decreasing, the, number, of, stitches, thread, used, in, weaving, is, usually, much, finer, than, the, yarn, used, in, knitting, which, can, give, the, knitted, fabric, more, bulk, and, less, drape, than, a, woven, fabric, if, they, are, not, secured, the, loops, of, a, knitted, course, will, come, undone, when, their, yarn, is, pulled, this, is, known, as, ripping, out, unravelling, knitting, or, humorously, frogging, because, you, rip, it, this, sounds, like, a, frog, croaking, rib, bit, to, secure, a, stitch, at, least, one, new, loop, is, passed, through, it, although, the, new, stitch, is, itself, unsecured, active, or, live, it, secures, the, stitch, es, suspended, from, it, a, sequence, of, stitches, in, which, each, stitch, is, suspended, from, the, next, is, called, a, wale, to, secure, the, initial, stitches, of, a, knitted, fabric, a, method, for, casting, on, is, used, to, secure, the, final, stitches, in, a, wale, one, uses, a, method, of, binding, casting, off, during, knitting, the, active, stitches, are, secured, mechanically, either, from, individual, hooks, in, knitting, machines, or, from, a, knitting, needle, or, frame, in, hand, knitting, there, are, two, major, varieties, of, knitting, weft, knitting, and, warp, knitting, in, the, more, common, weft, knitting, the, wales, are, perpendicular, to, the, course, of, the, yarn, in, warp, knitting, the, wales, and, courses, run, roughly, parallel, in, weft, knitting, the, entire, fabric, may, be, produced, from, a, single, yarn, by, adding, stitches, to, each, wale, in, turn, moving, across, the, fabric, as, in, a, raster, scan, by, contrast, in, warp, knitting, one, yarn, is, required, for, every, wale, since, a, typical, piece, of, knitted, fabric, may, have, hundreds, of, wales, warp, knitting, is, typically, done, by, machine, whereas, weft, knitting, is, done, by, both, hand, and, machine, warp, knitted, fabrics, such, as, tricot, and, milanese, are, resistant, to, runs, and, are, commonly, used, in, lingerie, weft, knit, fabrics, may, also, be, knit, with, multiple, yarns, usually, to, produce, interesting, color, patterns, the, two, most, common, approaches, are, intarsia, and, stranded, colorwork, in, intarsia, the, yarns, are, used, in, well, segregated, regions, e, g, a, red, apple, on, a, field, of, green, in, that, case, the, yarns, are, kept, on, separate, spools, and, only, one, is, knitted, at, any, time, in, the, more, complex, stranded, approach, two, or, more, yarns, alternate, repeatedly, within, one, row, and, all, the, yarns, must, be, carried, along, the, row, as, seen, in, fair, isle, sweaters, double, knitting, can, produce, two, separate, knitted, fabrics, simultaneously, e, g, two, socks, however, the, two, fabrics, are, usually, integrated, into, one, giving, it, great, warmth, and, excellent, drape, in, securing, the, previous, stitch, in, a, wale, the, next, stitch, can, pass, through, the, previous, loop, from, either, below, or, above, if, the, former, the, stitch, is, denoted, as, a, knit, stitch, or, a, plain, stitch, if, the, latter, as, a, purl, stitch, the, two, stitches, are, related, in, that, a, knit, stitch, seen, from, one, side, of, the, fabric, appears, as, a, purl, stitch, on, the, other, side, the, two, types, of, stitches, have, a, different, visual, effect, the, knit, stitches, look, like, v, s, stacked, vertically, whereas, the, purl, stitches, look, like, a, wavy, horizontal, line, across, the, fabric, patterns, and, pictures, can, be, created, in, knitted, fabrics, by, using, knit, and, purl, stitches, as, pixels, however, such, pixels, are, usually, rectangular, rather, than, square, depending, on, the, gauge, tension, of, the, knitting, individual, stitches, or, rows, of, stitches, may, be, made, taller, by, drawing, more, yarn, into, the, new, loop, an, elongated, stitch, which, is, the, basis, for, uneven, knitting, a, row, of, tall, stitches, may, alternate, with, one, or, more, rows, of, short, stitches, for, an, interesting, visual, effect, short, and, tall, stitches, may, also, alternate, within, a, row, forming, a, fish, like, oval, pattern, in, the, simplest, of, hand, knitted, fabrics, every, row, of, stitches, are, all, knit, or, all, purl, this, creates, a, stockinette, stitch, stocking, stitch, fabric, alternating, rows, of, all, knit, stitches, and, all, purl, stitches, creates, a, garter, stitch, pattern, vertical, stripes, ribbing, are, possible, by, having, alternating, wales, of, knit, and, purl, stitches, for, example, a, common, choice, is, 2x2, ribbing, in, which, two, wales, of, knit, stitches, are, followed, by, two, wales, of, purl, stitches, etc, horizontal, striping, welting, is, also, possible, by, alternating, rows, of, knit, and, purl, stitches, checkerboard, patterns, basketweave, are, also, possible, the, smallest, of, which, is, known, as, seed, moss, stitch, the, stitches, alternate, between, knit, and, purl, in, every, wale, and, along, every, row, fabrics, in, which, each, knitted, row, is, followed, by, a, purled, row, such, as, in, stockinette, stocking, stitch, have, a, tendency, to, curl, top, and, bottom, curl, toward, the, front, or, knitted, side, while, the, sides, curl, toward, the, back, or, purled, side, by, contrast, those, in, which, knit, and, purl, stitches, are, arranged, symmetrically, such, as, ribbing, garter, stitch, or, seed, moss, stitch, have, more, texture, and, tend, to, lie, flat, wales, of, purl, stitches, have, a, tendency, to, recede, whereas, those, of, knit, stitches, tend, to, come, forward, giving, the, fabric, more, stretchability, thus, the, purl, wales, in, ribbing, tend, to, be, invisible, since, the, neighboring, knit, wales, come, forward, conversely, rows, of, purl, stitches, tend, to, form, an, embossed, ridge, relative, to, a, row, of, knit, stitches, this, is, the, basis, of, shadow, knitting, in, which, the, appearance, of, a, knitted, fabric, changes, when, viewed, from, different, directions, typically, a, new, stitch, is, passed, through, a, single, unsecured, active, loop, thus, lengthening, that, wale, by, one, stitch, however, this, need, not, be, so, the, new, loop, may, be, passed, through, an, already, secured, stitch, lower, down, on, the, fabric, or, even, between, secured, stitches, a, dip, stitch, depending, on, the, distance, between, where, the, loop, is, drawn, through, the, fabric, and, where, it, is, knitted, dip, stitches, can, produce, a, subtle, stippling, or, long, lines, across, the, surface, of, the, fabric, e, g, the, lower, leaves, of, a, flower, the, new, loop, may, also, be, passed, between, two, stitches, in, the, present, row, thus, clustering, the, intervening, stitches, this, approach, is, often, used, to, produce, a, smocking, effect, in, the, fabric, the, new, loop, may, also, be, passed, through, two, or, more, previous, stitches, producing, a, decrease, and, merging, wales, together, the, merged, stitches, need, not, be, from, the, same, row, for, example, a, tuck, can, be, formed, by, knitting, stitches, together, from, two, different, rows, producing, a, raised, horizontal, welt, on, the, fabric, not, every, stitch, in, a, row, need, be, knitted, some, may, be, missed, unknitted, and, passed, to, the, active, needle, and, knitted, on, a, subsequent, row, this, is, known, as, slip, stitch, knitting, the, slipped, stitches, are, naturally, longer, than, the, knitted, ones, for, example, a, stitch, slipped, for, one, row, before, knitting, would, be, roughly, twice, as, tall, as, its, knitted, counterparts, this, can, produce, interesting, visual, effects, although, the, resulting, fabric, is, more, rigid, because, the, slipped, stitch, pulls, on, its, neighbours, and, is, less, deformable, mosaic, knitting, is, a, form, of, slip, stitch, knitting, that, knits, alternate, colored, rows, and, uses, slip, stitches, to, form, patterns, mosaic, knit, fabrics, tend, to, be, stiffer, than, patterned, fabrics, produced, by, other, methods, such, as, fair, isle, knitting, in, some, cases, a, stitch, may, be, deliberately, left, unsecured, by, a, new, stitch, and, its, wale, allowed, to, disassemble, this, is, known, as, drop, stitch, knitting, and, produces, a, vertical, ladder, of, see, through, holes, in, the, fabric, corresponding, to, where, the, wale, had, been, while, creating, knitting, by, hand, usually, two, needles, are, used, to, hold, the, live, stitches, while, crochet, uses, a, single, hook, usually, creating, one, stitch, at, a, time, finishing, one, stitch, before, creating, the, next, knitted, fabric, tends, to, be, flexible, and, flowing, the, stitches, forming, a, shape, that, is, similar, to, a, v, crochet, fabric, has, a, more, structured, feel, each, stitch, consisting, of, several, loops, entwined, each, textile, has, its, own, specialties, and, methods, because, of, the, different, nature, of, each, stitch, crochet, fabric, uses, more, yarn, per, stitch, is, more, structured, and, is, more, flexible, in, the, structures, that, can, be, created, not, being, restrained, to, create, a, stitch, in, the, following, stitch, knitted, fabric, tends, to, be, thinner, more, flexible, and, usually, has, easier, to, understand, patterns, because, each, new, stitch, must, go, into, the, next, stitch, because, of, the, differences, in, how, the, fabrics, are, created, the, first, knitting, machine, was, invented, in, victorian, times, while, machine, that, can, stitch, a, crochet, fabric, has, yet, to, be, produced, although, different, methods, they, can, create, similar, projects, using, the, same, fibers, and, yarns, both, knit, and, purl, stitches, may, be, twisted, usually, once, if, at, all, but, sometimes, twice, and, very, rarely, thrice, when, seen, from, above, the, twist, can, be, clockwise, right, yarn, over, left, or, counterclockwise, left, yarn, over, right, these, are, denoted, as, right, and, left, plaited, stitches, respectively, hand, knitters, generally, produce, right, plaited, stitches, by, knitting, or, purling, through, the, back, loops, i, e, passing, the, needle, through, the, initial, stitch, in, an, unusual, way, but, wrapping, the, yarn, as, usual, by, contrast, the, left, plaited, stitch, is, generally, formed, by, hand, knitters, by, wrapping, the, yarn, in, the, opposite, way, rather, than, by, any, change, in, the, needle, although, they, are, mirror, images, in, form, right, and, left, plaited, stitches, are, functionally, equivalent, both, types, of, plaited, stitches, give, a, subtle, but, interesting, visual, texture, and, tend, to, draw, the, fabric, inwards, making, it, stiffer, plaited, stitches, are, a, common, method, for, knitting, jewelry, from, fine, metal, wire, the, initial, and, final, edges, of, a, knitted, fabric, are, known, as, the, cast, on, and, bound, cast, off, edges, the, side, edges, are, known, as, the, selvages, the, word, derives, from, self, edges, meaning, that, the, stitches, do, not, need, to, be, secured, by, anything, else, many, types, of, selvages, have, been, developed, with, different, elastic, and, ornamental, properties, vertical, and, horizontal, edges, can, be, introduced, within, a, knitted, fabric, e, g, for, button, holes, by, binding, casting, off, and, re, casting, on, again, horizontal, or, by, knitting, the, fabrics, on, either, side, of, a, vertical, edge, separately, two, knitted, fabrics, can, be, joined, by, embroidery, based, grafting, methods, most, commonly, the, kitchener, stitch, new, wales, can, be, begun, from, any, of, the, edges, of, a, knitted, fabric, this, is, known, as, picking, up, stitches, and, is, the, basis, for, entrelac, in, which, the, wales, run, perpendicular, to, one, another, in, a, checkerboard, pattern, ordinarily, stitches, are, knitted, in, the, same, order, in, every, row, and, the, wales, of, the, fabric, run, parallel, and, vertically, along, the, fabric, however, this, need, not, be, so, since, the, order, in, which, stitches, are, knitted, may, be, permuted, so, that, wales, cross, over, one, another, forming, a, cable, pattern, cable, patterns, tend, to, draw, the, fabric, together, making, it, denser, and, less, elastic, aran, sweaters, are, a, common, form, of, knitted, cabling, arbitrarily, complex, braid, patterns, can, be, done, in, cable, knitting, with, the, proviso, that, the, wales, must, move, ever, upwards, it, is, generally, impossible, for, a, wale, to, move, up, and, then, down, the, fabric, knitters, have, developed, methods, for, giving, the, illusion, of, a, circular, wale, such, as, appear, in, celtic, knots, but, these, are, inexact, approximations, however, such, circular, wales, are, possible, using, swiss, darning, a, form, of, embroidery, or, by, knitting, a, tube, separately, and, attaching, it, to, the, knitted, fabric, a, wale, can, split, into, two, or, more, wales, using, increases, most, commonly, involving, a, yarn, over, depending, on, how, the, increase, is, done, there, is, often, a, hole, in, the, fabric, at, the, point, of, the, increase, this, is, used, to, great, effect, in, lace, knitting, which, consists, of, making, patterns, and, pictures, using, such, holes, rather, than, with, the, stitches, themselves, the, large, and, many, holes, in, lacy, knitting, makes, it, extremely, elastic, for, example, some, shetland, wedding, ring, shawls, are, so, fine, that, they, may, be, drawn, through, a, wedding, ring, by, combining, increases, and, decreases, it, is, possible, to, make, the, direction, of, a, wale, slant, away, from, vertical, even, in, weft, knitting, this, is, the, basis, for, bias, knitting, and, can, be, used, for, visual, effect, similar, to, the, direction, of, a, brush, stroke, in, oil, painting, various, point, like, ornaments, may, be, added, to, knitting, for, their, look, or, to, improve, the, wear, of, the, fabric, examples, include, various, types, of, bobbles, sequins, and, beads, long, loops, can, also, be, drawn, out, and, secured, forming, a, shaggy, texture, to, the, fabric, this, is, known, as, loop, knitting, additional, patterns, can, be, made, on, the, surface, of, the, knitted, fabric, using, embroidery, if, the, embroidery, resembles, knitting, it, is, often, called, swiss, darning, various, closures, for, the, garments, such, as, frogs, and, buttons, can, be, added, usually, buttonholes, are, knitted, into, the, garment, rather, than, cut, ornamental, pieces, may, also, be, knitted, separately, and, then, attached, using, applique, for, example, differently, colored, leaves, and, petals, of, a, flower, could, be, knit, separately, and, attached, to, form, the, final, picture, separately, knitted, tubes, can, be, applied, to, a, knitted, fabric, to, form, complex, celtic, knots, and, other, patterns, that, would, be, difficult, to, knit, unknitted, yarns, may, be, worked, into, knitted, fabrics, for, warmth, as, is, done, in, tufting, and, weaving, also, known, as, couching, the, word, is, derived, from, knot, and, ultimately, from, the, old, english, cnyttan, to, knot, the, exact, origins, of, knitting, are, unknown, the, earliest, known, examples, being, cotton, socks, dating, from, the, 11th, century, found, in, the, remains, of, the, city, of, fustat, now, part, of, cairo, n, lebinding, danish, literally, binding, with, a, needle, or, needle, binding, is, a, fabric, creation, technique, predating, both, knitting, and, crochet, the, first, commercial, knitting, guilds, appear, in, western, europe, in, the, early, fifteenth, century, tournai, in, 1429, barcelona, in, 1496, the, guild, of, saint, fiacre, was, founded, in, paris, in, 1527, but, the, archives, mention, an, organization, not, necessarily, a, guild, of, knitters, from, 1268, the, occupation, cap, knitter, describes, margaret, yeo, of, london, in, 1473, with, the, invention, in, 1589, of, the, stocking, frame, an, early, form, of, knitting, machine, knitting, by, hand, became, a, craft, used, by, country, people, with, easy, access, to, fiber, similar, to, quilting, spinning, and, needlepoint, hand, knitting, became, a, leisure, activity, for, the, wealthy, english, roman, catholic, priest, and, former, anglican, bishop, richard, rutt, authored, a, history, of, the, craft, in, a, history, of, hand, knitting, batsford, 1987, his, collection, of, books, about, knitting, is, now, housed, at, the, winchester, school, of, art, university, of, southampton, the, topology, of, a, knitted, fabric, is, relatively, complex, unlike, woven, fabrics, where, strands, usually, run, straight, horizontally, and, vertically, yarn, that, has, been, knitted, follows, a, looped, path, along, its, row, as, with, the, red, strand, in, the, diagram, at, left, in, which, the, loops, of, one, row, have, all, been, pulled, through, the, loops, of, the, row, below, it, because, there, is, no, single, straight, line, of, yarn, anywhere, in, the, pattern, a, knitted, piece, of, fabric, can, stretch, in, all, directions, this, elasticity, is, all, but, unavailable, in, woven, fabrics, which, only, stretch, along, the, bias, many, modern, stretchy, garments, even, as, they, rely, on, elastic, synthetic, materials, for, some, stretch, also, achieve, at, least, some, of, their, stretch, through, knitted, patterns, the, basic, knitted, fabric, as, in, the, diagram, and, usually, called, a, stocking, or, stockinette, pattern, has, a, definite, right, side, and, wrong, side, on, the, right, side, the, visible, portions, of, the, loops, are, the, verticals, connecting, two, rows, which, are, arranged, in, a, grid, of, v, shapes, on, the, wrong, side, the, ends, of, the, loops, are, visible, both, the, tops, and, bottoms, creating, a, much, more, bumpy, texture, sometimes, called, reverse, stockinette, despite, being, the, wrong, side, reverse, stockinette, is, frequently, used, as, a, pattern, in, its, own, right, because, the, yarn, holding, rows, together, is, all, on, the, front, and, the, yarn, holding, side, by, side, stitches, together, is, all, on, the, back, stockinette, fabric, has, a, strong, tendency, to, curl, toward, the, front, on, the, top, and, bottom, and, toward, the, back, on, the, left, and, right, side, stitches, can, be, worked, from, either, side, and, various, patterns, are, created, by, mixing, regular, knit, stitches, with, the, wrong, side, stitches, known, as, purl, stitches, either, in, columns, ribbing, rows, garter, welting, or, more, complex, patterns, each, fabric, has, different, properties, a, garter, stitch, has, much, more, vertical, stretch, while, ribbing, stretches, much, more, horizontally, because, of, their, front, back, symmetry, these, two, fabrics, have, little, curl, making, them, popular, as, edging, even, when, their, stretch, properties, are, not, desired, the, basic, knitted, fabrics, are, referred, to, by, different, names, in, the, setting, of, industrial, manufacture, the, fabric, known, by, hand, knitters, as, stockinette, is, called, plain, knit, or, jersey, and, the, fabric, known, by, hand, knitters, as, garter, is, called, purl, knitting, or, links, and, links, different, combinations, of, knit, and, purl, stitches, along, with, more, advanced, techniques, generate, fabrics, of, considerably, variable, consistency, from, gauzy, to, very, dense, from, highly, stretchy, to, relatively, stiff, from, flat, to, tightly, curled, and, so, on, the, most, common, texture, for, a, knitted, garment, is, that, generated, by, the, flat, stockinette, stitch, as, seen, though, very, small, in, machine, made, stockings, and, t, shirts, which, is, worked, in, the, round, as, nothing, but, knit, stitches, and, worked, flat, as, alternating, rows, of, knit, and, purl, other, simple, textures, can, be, made, with, nothing, but, knit, and, purl, stitches, including, garter, stitch, ribbing, and, moss, and, seed, stitches, adding, a, slip, stitch, where, a, loop, is, passed, from, one, needle, to, the, other, allows, for, a, wide, range, of, textures, including, heel, and, linen, stitches, as, well, as, a, number, of, more, complicated, patterns, some, more, advanced, knitting, techniques, create, a, surprising, variety, of, complex, textures, combining, certain, increases, which, can, create, small, eyelet, holes, in, the, resulting, fabric, with, assorted, decreases, is, key, to, creating, knitted, lace, a, very, open, fabric, resembling, needle, or, bobbin, lace, open, vertical, stripes, can, be, created, using, the, drop, stitch, knitting, technique, changing, the, order, of, stitches, from, one, row, to, the, next, usually, with, the, help, of, a, cable, needle, or, stitch, holder, is, key, to, cable, knitting, producing, an, endless, variety, of, cables, honeycombs, ropes, and, aran, sweater, patterning, entrelac, forms, a, rich, checkerboard, texture, by, knitting, small, squares, picking, up, their, side, edges, and, knitting, more, squares, to, continue, the, piece, fair, isle, knitting, uses, two, or, more, colored, yarns, to, create, patterns, and, forms, a, thicker, and, less, flexible, fabric, the, appearance, of, a, garment, is, also, affected, by, the, weight, of, the, yarn, which, describes, the, thickness, of, the, spun, fibre, the, thicker, the, yarn, the, more, visible, and, apparent, stitches, will, be, the, thinner, the, yarn, the, finer, the, texture, plenty, of, finished, knitting, projects, never, use, more, than, a, single, color, of, yarn, but, there, are, many, ways, to, work, in, multiple, colors, some, yarns, are, dyed, to, be, either, variegated, changing, color, every, few, stitches, in, a, random, fashion, or, self, striping, changing, every, few, rows, more, complicated, techniques, permit, large, fields, of, color, intarsia, for, example, busy, small, scale, patterns, of, color, such, as, fair, isle, or, both, double, knitting, and, slip, stitch, color, for, example, yarn, with, multiple, shades, of, the, same, hue, are, called, ombre, while, a, yarn, with, multiple, hues, may, be, known, as, a, given, colorway, a, green, red, and, yellow, yarn, might, be, dubbed, the, parrot, colorway, by, its, manufacturer, for, example, heathered, yarns, contain, small, amounts, of, fibre, of, different, colours, while, tweed, yarns, may, have, greater, amounts, of, different, colored, fibres, there, are, many, hundreds, of, different, knitting, stitches, used, by, hand, knitters, a, piece, of, hand, knitting, begins, with, the, process, of, casting, on, which, involves, the, initial, creation, of, the, stitches, on, the, needle, different, methods, of, casting, on, are, used, for, different, effects, one, may, be, stretchy, enough, for, lace, while, another, provides, a, decorative, edging, provisional, cast, ons, are, used, when, the, knitting, will, continue, in, both, directions, from, the, cast, on, there, are, various, methods, employed, to, cast, on, such, as, the, thumb, method, also, known, as, slingshot, or, long, tail, cast, ons, where, the, stitches, are, created, by, a, series, of, loops, that, will, when, knitted, give, a, very, loose, edge, ideal, for, picking, up, stitches, and, knitting, a, border, the, double, needle, method, also, known, as, knit, on, or, cable, cast, on, whereby, each, loop, placed, on, the, needle, is, then, knitted, on, which, produces, a, firmer, edge, ideal, on, its, own, as, a, border, and, many, more, the, number, of, active, stitches, remains, the, same, as, when, cast, on, unless, stitches, are, added, an, increase, or, removed, a, decrease, most, western, style, hand, knitters, follow, either, the, english, style, in, which, the, yarn, is, held, in, the, right, hand, or, the, continental, style, in, which, the, yarn, is, held, in, the, left, hand, there, are, also, different, ways, to, insert, the, needle, into, the, stitch, knitting, through, the, front, of, a, stitch, is, called, western, knitting, going, through, the, back, of, a, stitch, is, called, eastern, knitting, a, third, method, called, combination, knitting, goes, through, the, front, of, a, knit, stitch, and, the, back, of, a, purl, stitch, once, the, hand, knitted, piece, is, finished, the, remaining, live, stitches, are, cast, off, casting, or, binding, off, loops, the, stitches, across, each, other, so, they, can, be, removed, from, the, needle, without, unravelling, the, item, although, the, mechanics, are, different, from, casting, on, there, is, a, similar, variety, of, methods, in, hand, knitting, certain, articles, of, clothing, especially, larger, ones, like, sweaters, the, final, knitted, garment, will, be, made, of, several, knitted, pieces, with, individual, sections, of, the, garment, hand, knitted, separately, and, then, sewn, together, seamless, knitting, where, a, whole, garment, is, hand, knit, as, a, single, piece, is, also, possible, elizabeth, zimmermann, is, probably, the, best, known, proponent, of, seamless, or, circular, hand, knitting, techniques, smaller, items, such, as, socks, and, hats, are, usually, knit, in, one, piece, on, double, pointed, needles, or, circular, needles, hats, in, particular, can, be, started, top, down, on, double, pointed, needles, with, the, increases, added, until, the, preferred, size, is, achieved, switching, to, an, appropriate, circular, needle, when, enough, stitches, have, been, added, care, must, be, taken, to, bind, off, at, a, tension, that, will, allow, the, give, needed, to, comfortably, fit, on, the, head, see, circular, knitting, knitting, can, also, be, performed, by, machines, the, first, knitting, machine, known, as, the, stocking, frame, was, invented, in, england, in, 1589, modern, knitting, machines, both, domestic, and, industrial, are, either, flat, bed, or, circular, flat, bed, knitting, machines, knit, back, and, forth, producing, a, flat, piece, of, fabric, flat, bed, machines, can, produce, uniform, width, fabric, which, can, be, cut, and, sewn, into, garments, or, they, can, produce, shaped, pieces, which, can, be, seamed, to, make, garments, without, cutting, the, latter, is, known, as, full, fashioned, knitting, circular, knitting, machines, knit, in, a, continuous, circle, producing, a, tubular, piece, of, fabric, similarly, to, knitted, fabrics, manufactured, on, flat, bed, machines, a, tube, of, uniform, width, fabric, may, be, cut, along, one, side, to, produce, flat, fabric, which, can, be, cut, and, sewn, into, garments, fabric, produced, in, this, way, can, be, cheaper, than, fabric, produced, on, a, flat, bed, machine, as, circular, machines, can, operate, at, higher, speed, circular, knitting, machines, can, also, be, used, to, create, shaped, finished, articles, such, as, socks, yarn, for, hand, knitting, is, usually, sold, as, balls, or, skeins, hanks, and, it, may, also, be, wound, on, spools, or, cones, skeins, and, balls, are, generally, sold, with, a, yarn, band, a, label, that, describes, the, yarn, s, weight, length, dye, lot, fiber, content, washing, instructions, suggested, needle, size, likely, gauge, tension, etc, it, is, common, practice, to, save, the, yarn, band, for, future, reference, especially, if, additional, skeins, must, be, purchased, knitters, generally, ensure, that, the, yarn, for, a, project, comes, from, a, single, dye, lot, the, dye, lot, specifies, a, group, of, skeins, that, were, dyed, together, and, thus, have, precisely, the, same, color, skeins, from, different, dye, lots, even, if, very, similar, in, color, are, usually, slightly, different, and, may, produce, a, visible, horizontal, stripe, when, knitted, together, if, a, knitter, buys, insufficient, yarn, of, a, single, dye, lot, to, complete, a, project, additional, skeins, of, the, same, dye, lot, can, sometimes, be, obtained, from, other, yarn, stores, or, online, otherwise, knitters, can, alternate, skeins, every, few, rows, to, help, the, dye, lots, blend, together, easier, the, thickness, or, weight, of, the, yarn, is, a, significant, factor, in, determining, the, gauge, tension, i, e, how, many, stitches, and, rows, are, required, to, cover, a, given, area, for, a, given, stitch, pattern, thicker, yarns, generally, require, thicker, knitting, needles, whereas, thinner, yarns, may, be, knit, with, thick, or, thin, needles, hence, thicker, yarns, generally, require, fewer, stitches, and, therefore, less, time, to, knit, up, a, given, garment, patterns, and, motifs, are, coarser, with, thicker, yarns, thicker, yarns, produce, bold, visual, effects, whereas, thinner, yarns, are, best, for, refined, patterns, yarns, are, grouped, by, thickness, into, six, categories, superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky, and, superbulky, quantitatively, thickness, is, measured, by, the, number, of, wraps, per, inch, wpi, in, the, british, commonwealth, outside, north, america, yarns, are, measured, as, 1ply, 2ply, 3ply, 4ply, 5ply, 8ply, or, double, knit, 10ply, and, 12ply, triple, knit, the, related, weight, per, unit, length, is, usually, measured, in, tex, or, denier, before, knitting, the, knitter, will, typically, transform, a, hank, skein, into, a, ball, where, the, yarn, emerges, from, the, center, of, the, ball, this, making, the, knitting, easier, by, preventing, the, yarn, from, becoming, easily, tangled, this, transformation, may, be, done, by, hand, or, with, a, device, known, as, a, ballwinder, when, knitting, some, knitters, enclose, their, balls, in, jars, to, keep, them, clean, and, untangled, with, other, yarns, the, free, yarn, passes, through, a, small, hole, in, the, jar, lid, a, yarn, s, usefulness, for, a, knitting, project, is, judged, by, several, factors, such, as, its, loft, its, ability, to, trap, air, its, resilience, elasticity, under, tension, its, washability, and, colorfastness, its, hand, its, feel, particularly, softness, vs, scratchiness, its, durability, against, abrasion, its, resistance, to, pilling, its, hairiness, fuzziness, its, tendency, to, twist, or, untwist, its, overall, weight, and, drape, its, blocking, and, felting, qualities, its, comfort, breathability, moisture, absorption, wicking, properties, and, of, course, its, look, which, includes, its, color, sheen, smoothness, and, ornamental, features, other, factors, include, allergenicity, speed, of, drying, resistance, to, chemicals, moths, and, mildew, melting, point, and, flammability, retention, of, static, electricity, and, the, propensity, to, become, stained, and, to, accept, dyes, different, factors, may, be, more, significant, than, others, for, different, knitting, projects, so, there, is, no, one, best, yarn, the, resilience, and, propensity, to, un, twist, are, general, properties, that, affect, the, ease, of, hand, knitting, more, resilient, yarns, are, more, forgiving, of, irregularities, in, tension, highly, twisted, yarns, are, sometimes, difficult, to, knit, whereas, untwisting, yarns, can, lead, to, split, stitches, in, which, not, all, the, yarn, is, knitted, into, a, stitch, a, key, factor, in, knitting, is, stitch, definition, corresponding, to, how, well, complicated, stitch, patterns, can, be, seen, when, made, from, a, given, yarn, smooth, highly, spun, yarns, are, best, for, showing, off, stitch, patterns, at, the, other, extreme, very, fuzzy, yarns, or, eyelash, yarns, have, poor, stitch, definition, and, any, complicated, stitch, pattern, would, be, invisible, although, knitting, may, be, done, with, ribbons, metal, wire, or, more, exotic, filaments, most, yarns, are, made, by, spinning, fibers, in, spinning, the, fibers, are, twisted, so, that, the, yarn, resists, breaking, under, tension, the, twisting, may, be, done, in, either, direction, resulting, in, a, z, twist, or, s, twist, yarn, if, the, fibers, are, first, aligned, by, combing, them, the, yarn, is, smoother, and, called, a, worsted, by, contrast, if, the, fibers, are, carded, but, not, combed, the, yarn, is, fuzzier, and, called, woolen, spun, the, fibers, making, up, a, yarn, may, be, continuous, filament, fibers, such, as, silk, and, many, synthetics, or, they, may, be, staples, fibers, of, an, average, length, typically, a, few, inches, naturally, filament, fibers, are, sometimes, cut, up, into, staples, before, spinning, the, strength, of, the, spun, yarn, against, breaking, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, twist, the, length, of, the, fibers, and, the, thickness, of, the, yarn, in, general, yarns, become, stronger, with, more, twist, also, called, worst, longer, fibers, and, thicker, yarns, more, fibers, for, example, thinner, yarns, require, more, twist, than, do, thicker, yarns, to, resist, breaking, under, tension, the, thickness, of, the, yarn, may, vary, along, its, length, a, slub, is, a, much, thicker, section, in, which, a, mass, of, fibers, is, incorporated, into, the, yarn, the, spun, fibers, are, generally, divided, into, animal, fibers, plant, and, synthetic, fibers, these, fiber, types, are, chemically, different, corresponding, to, proteins, carbohydrates, and, synthetic, polymers, respectively, animal, fibers, include, silk, but, generally, are, long, hairs, of, animals, such, as, sheep, wool, goat, angora, or, cashmere, goat, rabbit, angora, llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and, muskox, qiviut, plants, used, for, fibers, include, cotton, flax, for, linen, bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut, husk, banana, fiber, soy, and, corn, rayon, and, acetate, fibers, are, also, produced, from, cellulose, mainly, derived, from, trees, common, synthetic, fibers, include, acrylics, polyesters, such, as, dacron, and, ingeo, nylon, and, other, polyamides, and, olefins, such, as, polypropylene, of, these, types, wool, is, generally, favored, for, knitting, chiefly, owing, to, its, superior, elasticity, warmth, and, sometimes, felting, it, is, also, common, to, blend, different, fibers, in, the, yarn, e, g, 85, alpaca, and, 15, silk, even, within, a, type, of, fiber, there, can, be, great, variety, in, the, length, and, thickness, of, the, fibers, for, example, merino, wool, and, egyptian, cotton, are, favored, because, they, produce, exceptionally, long, thin, fine, fibers, for, their, type, a, single, spun, yarn, may, be, knitted, as, is, or, braided, or, plied, with, another, in, plying, two, or, more, yarns, are, spun, together, almost, always, in, the, opposite, sense, from, which, they, were, spun, individually, for, example, two, z, twist, yarns, are, usually, plied, with, an, s, twist, the, opposing, twist, relieves, some, of, the, yarns, tendency, to, curl, up, and, produces, a, thicker, balanced, yarn, plied, yarns, may, themselves, be, plied, together, producing, cabled, yarns, or, multi, stranded, yarns, sometimes, the, yarns, being, plied, are, fed, at, different, rates, so, that, one, yarn, loops, around, the, other, as, in, boucl, the, single, yarns, may, be, dyed, separately, before, plying, or, afterwards, to, give, the, yarn, a, uniform, look, the, dyeing, of, yarns, is, a, complex, art, that, has, a, long, history, however, yarns, need, not, be, dyed, they, may, be, dyed, just, one, color, or, a, great, variety, of, colors, dyeing, may, be, done, industrially, by, hand, or, even, hand, painted, onto, the, yarn, a, great, variety, of, synthetic, dyes, have, been, developed, since, the, synthesis, of, indigo, dye, in, the, mid, 19th, century, however, natural, dyes, are, also, possible, although, they, are, generally, less, brilliant, the, color, scheme, of, a, yarn, is, sometimes, called, its, colorway, variegated, yarns, can, produce, interesting, visual, effects, such, as, diagonal, stripes, conversely, a, variegated, yarn, may, obscure, a, detailed, knitting, design, such, as, a, cable, or, lace, pattern, there, are, multiple, commercial, applications, for, knit, fabric, made, of, metal, wire, by, knitting, machines, steel, wire, of, various, sizes, may, be, used, for, electric, and, magnetic, shielding, due, to, its, conductivity, stainless, steel, may, be, used, in, a, coffee, press, for, its, rust, resistance, metal, wire, can, also, be, used, as, jewelry, knitted, glass, combines, knitting, with, wax, strands, lost, wax, casting, mold, making, and, kiln, casting, the, process, of, knitting, has, three, basic, tasks, in, very, simple, cases, knitting, can, be, done, without, tools, using, only, the, fingers, to, do, these, tasks, however, knitting, is, usually, carried, out, using, tools, such, as, knitting, needles, knitting, machines, or, rigid, frames, depending, on, their, size, and, shape, the, rigid, frames, are, called, stocking, frames, knitting, boards, knitting, rings, also, called, knitting, looms, or, knitting, spools, also, known, as, knitting, knobbies, knitting, nancies, or, corkers, there, is, also, a, technique, called, knooking, of, knitting, with, a, crochet, hook, that, has, a, cord, attached, to, the, end, to, hold, the, stitches, while, they, re, being, worked, other, tools, are, used, to, prepare, yarn, for, knitting, to, measure, and, design, knitted, garments, or, to, make, knitting, easier, or, more, comfortable, there, are, three, basic, types, of, knitting, needles, also, called, knitting, pins, the, first, and, most, common, type, consists, of, two, slender, straight, sticks, tapered, to, a, point, at, one, end, and, with, a, knob, at, the, other, end, to, prevent, stitches, from, slipping, off, such, needles, are, usually, 10, 16, inches, 250, 410, mm, long, but, due, to, the, compressibility, of, knitted, fabrics, may, be, used, to, knit, pieces, significantly, wider, the, most, important, property, of, needles, is, their, diameter, which, ranges, from, below, 2, to, 25, mm, roughly, 1, inch, the, diameter, affects, the, size, of, stitches, which, affects, the, gauge, tension, of, the, knitting, and, the, elasticity, of, the, fabric, thus, a, simple, way, to, change, gauge, tension, is, to, use, different, needles, which, is, the, basis, of, uneven, knitting, although, the, diameter, of, the, knitting, needle, is, often, measured, in, millimeters, there, are, several, measurement, systems, particularly, those, specific, to, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, japan, a, conversion, table, is, given, at, knitting, needle, such, knitting, needles, may, be, made, out, of, any, materials, but, the, most, common, materials, are, metals, wood, bamboo, and, plastic, different, materials, have, different, frictions, and, grip, the, yarn, differently, slick, needles, such, as, metallic, needles, are, useful, for, swift, knitting, whereas, rougher, needles, such, as, bamboo, offer, more, friction, and, are, therefore, less, prone, to, dropping, stitches, the, knitting, of, new, stitches, occurs, only, at, the, tapered, ends, needles, with, lighted, tips, have, been, sold, to, allow, knitters, to, knit, in, the, dark, the, second, type, of, knitting, needles, are, straight, double, pointed, knitting, needles, also, called, dpns, double, pointed, needles, are, tapered, at, both, ends, which, allows, them, to, be, knit, from, either, end, dpns, are, typically, used, for, circular, knitting, especially, smaller, tube, shaped, pieces, such, as, sleeves, collars, and, socks, usually, one, needle, is, active, while, the, others, hold, the, remaining, active, stitches, dpns, are, somewhat, shorter, typically, 7, inches, and, are, usually, sold, in, sets, of, four, or, five, the, third, needle, type, consists, of, circular, needles, which, are, long, flexible, double, pointed, needles, the, two, tapered, ends, typically, 5, inches, 130, mm, long, are, rigid, and, straight, allowing, for, easy, knitting, however, the, two, ends, are, connected, by, a, flexible, strand, usually, nylon, that, allows, the, two, ends, to, be, brought, together, circular, needles, are, typically, 24, 60, inches, long, and, are, usually, used, singly, or, in, pairs, again, the, width, of, the, knitted, piece, may, be, significantly, longer, than, the, length, of, the, circular, needle, interchangeable, needles, are, a, subset, of, circular, needles, they, are, kits, consist, of, pairs, of, needles, with, usually, nylon, cables, or, cords, the, cables, cords, are, screwed, into, the, needles, allowing, the, knitter, to, have, both, flexible, straight, needles, or, circular, needles, this, also, allows, the, knitter, to, change, the, diameter, and, length, of, the, needles, as, needed, the, needles, must, be, screwed, on, tightly, otherwise, yarn, can, snag, and, become, damaged, the, ability, to, work, from, either, end, of, one, needle, is, convenient, in, several, types, of, knitting, such, as, slip, stitch, versions, of, double, knitting, circular, needles, may, be, used, for, flat, or, circular, knitting, cable, needles, are, a, special, case, of, dpns, although, they, are, usually, not, straight, but, dimpled, in, the, middle, often, they, have, the, form, of, a, hook, when, cabling, a, knitted, piece, a, hook, is, easier, to, grab, and, hold, the, yarn, cable, needles, are, typically, very, short, a, few, inches, and, are, used, to, hold, stitches, temporarily, while, others, are, being, knitted, when, in, use, the, cable, needle, is, used, at, the, same, time, as, two, regular, needles, at, specific, points, indicated, by, the, knitting, pattern, the, cable, needle, is, moved, the, stitches, on, it, are, worked, by, the, other, needles, then, the, cable, needle, is, turned, around, to, a, different, position, to, create, the, cable, twist, cable, needles, are, a, specific, design, and, are, used, to, create, the, twisting, motif, of, a, knitted, cable, they, are, made, in, different, sizes, which, produces, cables, of, different, widths, various, tools, have, been, developed, to, make, hand, knitting, easier, tools, for, measuring, needle, diameter, and, yarn, properties, have, been, discussed, above, as, well, as, the, yarn, swift, ballwinder, and, yarntainers, crochet, hooks, and, a, darning, needle, are, often, useful, in, binding, casting, off, or, in, joining, two, knitted, pieces, edge, to, edge, the, darning, needle, is, used, in, duplicate, stitch, also, known, as, swiss, darning, the, crochet, hook, is, also, essential, for, repairing, dropped, stitches, and, some, specialty, stitches, such, as, tufting, other, tools, such, as, knitting, spools, or, pom, pom, makers, are, used, to, prepare, specific, ornaments, for, large, or, complex, knitting, patterns, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, keep, track, of, which, stitch, should, be, knit, in, a, particular, way, therefore, several, tools, have, been, developed, to, identify, the, number, of, a, particular, row, or, stitch, including, circular, stitch, markers, hanging, markers, extra, yarn, and, row, counters, a, second, potential, difficulty, is, that, the, knitted, piece, will, slide, off, the, tapered, end, of, the, needles, when, unattended, this, is, prevented, by, point, protectors, that, cap, the, tapered, ends, another, problem, is, that, too, much, knitting, may, lead, to, hand, and, wrist, troubles, for, this, special, stress, relieving, gloves, are, available, in, traditional, shetland, knitting, a, special, belt, is, often, used, to, support, the, end, of, one, needle, allowing, the, knitting, greater, speed, finally, there, are, sundry, bags, and, containers, for, holding, knitting, yarns, and, needles, continental, knitting, is, achieved, by, holding, the, yarn, in, your, left, hand, for, both, knitting, and, purling, patterns, are, created, on, the, outside, public, facing, side, of, the, piece, while, knit, stitches, are, worked, as, in, the, classic, continental, style, the, purl, is, worked, by, leaving, the, yarn, at, back, and, moving, the, needle, another, variation, on, continental, knitting, this, style, is, achieved, by, picking, up, the, yarn, by, moving, the, needle, head, into, it, now, wrap, the, yarn, around, the, index, finger, on, that, left, hand, so, it, is, coming, over, the, top, of, your, finger, and, back, around, underneath, it, and, on, top, of, your, middle, finger, you, will, wind, up, with, your, index, finger, very, close, to, the, back, of, your, left, hand, needle, in, russian, knitting, it, is, common, to, slip, the, first, stitch, of, every, row, english, style, knitting, is, achieved, by, holding, the, yarn, in, your, right, hand, patterns, are, created, on, the, outside, public, facing, side, of, the, piece, this, style, is, achieved, by, carrying, the, yarn, around, the, neck, or, from, a, necklace, style, hook, allowing, the, knitter, to, knit, on, the, reverse, purl, side, e, g, inside, out, compared, to, western, knitting, techniques, patterns, are, typically, created, by, stranding, the, yarn, on, the, outside, of, the, piece, this, is, an, ancient, style, of, knitting, which, spread, from, arabic, culture, to, the, iberian, peninsula, during, its, occupation, by, muslims, hence, this, style, was, taught, to, indigenous, south, americans, during, conquest, by, spanish, portuguese, colonists, the, armenian, knitting, technique, tacks, the, non, working, yarn, to, the, piece, regularly, to, limit, floats, you, will, tack, your, non, working, yarn, down, approximately, every, 3, stitches, a, technique, used, to, create, a, flat, smooth, reversible, fabric, that, looks, like, stockinette, or, jersey, on, both, sides, rather, than, having, a, knit, face, and, a, purl, reverse, side, a, method, by, which, many, different, yarns, are, used, throughout, the, row, and, when, not, being, used, are, floated, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, piece, mega, knitting, is, a, term, recently, coined, and, relates, to, the, use, of, knitting, needles, greater, than, or, equal, to, half, an, inch, in, diameter, mega, knitting, uses, the, same, stitches, and, techniques, as, conventional, knitting, except, that, hooks, are, carved, into, the, ends, of, the, needles, the, hooked, needles, greatly, enhance, control, of, the, work, catching, the, stitches, and, preventing, them, from, slipping, off, it, was, the, development, of, the, knitting, machine, that, introduced, hooked, needles, and, enabled, faultless, automated, knitting, the, hook, catches, the, loop, of, yarn, as, each, stitch, is, knitted, meaning, that, wrists, and, fingers, do, not, have, to, work, so, hard, and, there, is, less, chance, of, stitches, slipping, off, the, needle, the, position, of, the, hook, is, most, important, turn, the, left, non, working, hook, to, face, away, at, all, times, turn, the, right, working, hook, toward, you, up, whilst, knitting, plain, stitch, and, away, whilst, purling, mega, knitting, produces, a, chunky, bulky, fabric, or, an, open, lacy, weave, depending, on, the, weight, and, type, of, yarn, used, micro, knitting, or, miniature, knitting, uses, extremely, fine, threads, and, needles, anthea, crome, created, 14, tiny, sweaters, used, in, the, stop, motion, animated, film, coraline, and, has, made, objects, at, 60, or, 80, stitches, per, inch, making, her, own, needles, from, fine, surgical, steel, wire, she, has, published, bugknits, extreme, knitting, for, hobbyists, artists, and, knitters, 2009, blurb, isbn, 978, 1320025546, annelies, de, kort, has, knitted, on, an, even, smaller, scale, and, has, used, needles, of, 0, 4mm, in, short, row, knitting, the, work, is, turned, before, a, row, is, fully, knitted, there, are, several, ways, to, achieve, this, just, before, the, work, is, turned, the, working, yarn, is, passed, around, the, next, unknitted, stitch, forming, a, wrap, later, this, wrap, is, picked, up, and, knitted, into, a, stitch, concealing, it, from, view, in, german, short, rows, the, work, is, turned, and, the, last, stitch, worked, is, slipped, purlwise, with, yarn, in, front, to, the, right, needle, finally, the, working, yarn, is, pulled, over, the, top, of, the, needle, to, the, back, which, rotates, the, stitch, on, the, needle, so, that, it, tips, backwards, forming, what, appears, to, be, a, double, stitch, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, german, double, stitch, the, working, yarn, stays, to, the, back, for, the, next, stitch, if, it, is, to, be, knitted, or, rotated, below, the, right, needle, and, pulled, to, the, front, if,
