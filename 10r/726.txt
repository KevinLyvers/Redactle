a, hovercraft, pl, hovercraft, also, known, as, an, air, cushion, vehicle, or, acv, is, an, amphibious, craft, capable, of, travelling, over, land, water, mud, ice, and, various, other, surfaces, hovercraft, use, blowers, to, produce, a, large, volume, of, air, below, the, hull, or, air, cushion, that, is, slightly, above, atmospheric, pressure, the, pressure, difference, between, the, higher, pressure, air, below, the, hull, and, lower, pressure, ambient, air, above, it, produces, lift, which, causes, the, hull, to, float, above, the, running, surface, for, stability, reasons, the, air, is, typically, blown, through, slots, or, holes, around, the, outside, of, a, disk, or, oval, shaped, platform, giving, most, hovercraft, a, characteristic, rounded, rectangle, shape, the, first, practical, design, for, hovercraft, was, derived, from, a, british, invention, in, the, 1950s, they, are, now, used, throughout, the, world, as, specialised, transports, in, disaster, relief, coastguard, military, and, survey, applications, as, well, as, for, sport, or, passenger, service, very, large, versions, have, been, used, to, transport, hundreds, of, people, and, vehicles, across, the, english, channel, whilst, others, have, military, applications, used, to, transport, tanks, soldiers, and, large, equipment, in, hostile, environments, and, terrain, decline, in, public, demand, meant, that, as, of, 2023, the, only, year, round, public, hovercraft, service, in, the, world, still, in, operation, serves, between, the, isle, of, wight, and, southsea, in, the, uk, oita, hovercraft, is, planning, to, resume, services, in, oita, japan, in, 2024, although, now, a, generic, term, for, the, type, of, craft, the, name, hovercraft, itself, was, a, trademark, owned, by, saunders, roe, later, british, hovercraft, corporation, bhc, then, westland, hence, other, manufacturers, use, of, alternative, names, to, describe, the, vehicles, there, have, been, many, attempts, to, understand, the, principles, of, high, air, pressure, below, hulls, and, wings, hovercraft, are, unique, in, that, they, can, lift, themselves, while, still, differing, from, ground, effect, vehicles, and, hydrofoils, that, require, forward, motion, to, create, lift, the, first, mention, in, the, historical, record, of, the, concepts, behind, surface, effect, vehicles, to, use, the, term, hovering, was, by, swedish, scientist, emanuel, swedenborg, in, 1716, the, shipbuilder, john, isaac, thornycroft, patented, an, early, design, for, an, air, cushion, ship, hovercraft, in, the, 1870s, but, suitable, powerful, engines, were, not, available, until, the, 20th, century, in, 1915, the, austrian, dagobert, m, ller, von, thomam, hl, 1880, 1956, built, the, world, s, first, air, cushion, boat, luftkissengleitboot, shaped, like, a, section, of, a, large, aerofoil, this, creates, a, low, pressure, area, above, the, wing, much, like, an, aircraft, the, craft, was, propelled, by, four, aero, engines, driving, two, submerged, marine, propellers, with, a, fifth, engine, that, blew, air, under, the, front, of, the, craft, to, increase, the, air, pressure, under, it, only, when, in, motion, could, the, craft, trap, air, under, the, front, increasing, lift, the, vessel, also, required, a, depth, of, water, to, operate, and, could, not, transition, to, land, or, other, surfaces, designed, as, a, fast, torpedo, boat, the, versuchsgleitboot, had, a, top, speed, of, over, 32, knots, 59, km, h, it, was, thoroughly, tested, and, even, armed, with, torpedoes, and, machine, guns, for, operation, in, the, adriatic, it, never, saw, actual, combat, however, and, as, the, war, progressed, it, was, eventually, scrapped, due, to, a, lack, of, interest, and, perceived, need, and, its, engines, returned, to, the, air, force, the, theoretical, grounds, for, motion, over, an, air, layer, were, constructed, by, konstantin, eduardovich, tsiolkovskii, in, 1926, and, 1927, in, 1929, andrew, kucher, of, ford, began, experimenting, with, the, levapad, concept, metal, disks, with, pressurized, air, blown, through, a, hole, in, the, centre, levapads, do, not, offer, stability, on, their, own, several, must, be, used, together, to, support, a, load, above, them, lacking, a, skirt, the, pads, had, to, remain, very, close, to, the, running, surface, he, initially, imagined, these, being, used, in, place, of, casters, and, wheels, in, factories, and, warehouses, where, the, concrete, floors, offered, the, smoothness, required, for, operation, by, the, 1950s, ford, showed, a, number, of, toy, models, of, cars, using, the, system, but, mainly, proposed, its, use, as, a, replacement, for, wheels, on, trains, with, the, levapads, running, close, to, the, surface, of, existing, rails, in, 1931, finnish, aero, engineer, toivo, j, kaario, began, designing, a, developed, version, of, a, vessel, using, an, air, cushion, and, built, a, prototype, pintaliit, j, surface, glider, in, 1937, his, design, included, the, modern, features, of, a, lift, engine, blowing, air, into, a, flexible, envelope, for, lift, kaario, s, efforts, were, followed, closely, in, the, soviet, union, by, vladimir, levkov, who, returned, to, the, solid, sided, design, of, the, versuchsgleitboot, levkov, designed, and, built, a, number, of, similar, craft, during, the, 1930s, and, his, l, 5, fast, attack, boat, reached, 70, knots, 130, km, h, in, testing, however, the, start, of, world, war, ii, put, an, end, to, his, development, work, during, world, war, ii, an, american, engineer, charles, fletcher, invented, a, walled, air, cushion, vehicle, the, glidemobile, because, the, project, was, classified, by, the, u, s, government, fletcher, could, not, file, a, patent, in, april, 1958, ford, engineers, demonstrated, the, glide, air, a, one, metre, three, foot, model, of, a, wheel, less, vehicle, that, speeds, on, a, thin, film, of, air, only, 76, 2, m, 3, 1000, of, an, inch, above, its, tabletop, roadbed, an, article, in, modern, mechanix, quoted, andrew, a, kucher, ford, s, vice, president, in, charge, of, engineering, and, research, noting, we, look, upon, glide, air, as, a, new, form, of, high, speed, land, transportation, probably, in, the, field, of, rail, surface, travel, for, fast, trips, of, distances, of, up, to, about, 1, 600, kilometres, 1, 000, mi, in, 1959, ford, displayed, a, hovercraft, concept, car, the, ford, levacar, mach, i, in, august, 1961, popular, science, reported, on, the, aeromobile, 35b, an, air, cushion, vehicle, acv, that, was, invented, by, william, r, bertelsen, and, was, envisioned, to, revolutionise, the, transportation, system, with, personal, hovering, self, driving, cars, that, could, speed, up, to, 2, 400, km, h, 1, 500, mph, the, idea, of, the, modern, hovercraft, is, most, often, associated, with, christopher, cockerell, a, british, mechanical, engineer, cockerell, s, group, was, the, first, to, develop, the, use, of, a, ring, of, air, for, maintaining, the, cushion, the, first, to, develop, a, successful, skirt, and, the, first, to, demonstrate, a, practical, vehicle, in, continued, use, a, memorial, to, cockerell, s, first, design, stands, in, the, village, of, somerleyton, cockerell, came, across, the, key, concept, in, his, design, when, studying, the, ring, of, airflow, when, high, pressure, air, was, blown, into, the, annular, area, between, two, concentric, tin, cans, one, coffee, and, the, other, from, cat, food, and, a, hairdryer, this, produced, a, ring, of, airflow, as, expected, but, he, noticed, an, unexpected, benefit, as, well, the, sheet, of, fast, moving, air, presented, a, sort, of, physical, barrier, to, the, air, on, either, side, of, it, this, effect, which, he, called, the, momentum, curtain, could, be, used, to, trap, high, pressure, air, in, the, area, inside, the, curtain, producing, a, high, pressure, plenum, that, earlier, examples, had, to, build, up, with, considerably, more, airflow, in, theory, only, a, small, amount, of, active, airflow, would, be, needed, to, create, lift, and, much, less, than, a, design, that, relied, only, on, the, momentum, of, the, air, to, provide, lift, like, a, helicopter, in, terms, of, power, a, hovercraft, would, only, need, between, one, quarter, to, one, half, of, the, power, required, by, a, helicopter, cockerell, built, and, tested, several, models, of, his, hovercraft, design, in, somerleyton, suffolk, during, the, early, 1950s, the, design, featured, an, engine, mounted, to, blow, from, the, front, of, the, craft, into, a, space, below, it, combining, both, lift, and, propulsion, he, demonstrated, the, model, flying, over, many, whitehall, carpets, in, front, of, various, government, experts, and, ministers, and, the, design, was, subsequently, put, on, the, secret, list, in, spite, of, tireless, efforts, to, arrange, funding, no, branch, of, the, military, was, interested, as, he, later, joked, the, navy, said, it, was, a, plane, not, a, boat, the, raf, said, it, was, a, boat, not, a, plane, and, the, army, were, plain, not, interested, this, lack, of, military, interest, meant, that, there, was, no, reason, to, keep, the, concept, secret, and, it, was, declassified, cockerell, was, finally, able, to, convince, the, national, research, development, corporation, to, fund, development, of, a, full, scale, model, in, 1958, the, nrdc, placed, a, contract, with, saunders, roe, for, the, development, of, what, would, become, the, sr, n1, short, for, saunders, roe, nautical, 1, the, sr, n1, was, powered, by, a, 450, hp, alvis, leonides, engine, powering, a, vertical, fan, in, the, middle, of, the, craft, in, addition, to, providing, the, lift, air, a, portion, of, the, airflow, was, bled, off, into, two, channels, on, either, side, of, the, craft, which, could, be, directed, to, provide, thrust, in, normal, operation, this, extra, airflow, was, directed, rearward, for, forward, thrust, and, blew, over, two, large, vertical, rudders, that, provided, directional, control, for, low, speed, manoeuvrability, the, extra, thrust, could, be, directed, fore, or, aft, differentially, for, rotation, the, sr, n1, made, its, first, hover, on, 11, june, 1959, and, made, its, famed, successful, crossing, of, the, english, channel, on, 25, july, 1959, in, december, 1959, the, duke, of, edinburgh, visited, saunders, roe, at, east, cowes, and, persuaded, the, chief, test, pilot, commander, peter, lamb, to, allow, him, to, take, over, the, sr, n1, s, controls, he, flew, the, sr, n1, so, fast, that, he, was, asked, to, slow, down, a, little, on, examination, of, the, craft, afterwards, it, was, found, that, she, had, been, dished, in, the, bow, due, to, excessive, speed, damage, that, was, never, allowed, to, be, repaired, and, was, from, then, on, affectionately, referred, to, as, the, royal, dent, testing, quickly, demonstrated, that, the, idea, of, using, a, single, engine, to, provide, air, for, both, the, lift, curtain, and, forward, flight, required, too, many, trade, offs, a, blackburn, marbor, turbojet, for, forward, thrust, and, two, large, vertical, rudders, for, directional, control, were, added, producing, the, sr, n1, mk, ii, a, further, upgrade, with, the, armstrong, siddeley, viper, produced, the, mk, iii, further, modifications, especially, the, addition, of, pointed, nose, and, stern, areas, produced, the, mk, iv, although, the, sr, n1, was, successful, as, a, testbed, the, design, hovered, too, close, to, the, surface, to, be, practical, at, 9, inches, 23, cm, even, small, waves, would, hit, the, bow, the, solution, was, offered, by, cecil, latimer, needham, following, a, suggestion, made, by, his, business, partner, arthur, ord, hume, in, 1958, he, suggested, the, use, of, two, rings, of, rubber, to, produce, a, double, walled, extension, of, the, vents, in, the, lower, fuselage, when, air, was, blown, into, the, space, between, the, sheets, it, exited, the, bottom, of, the, skirt, in, the, same, way, it, formerly, exited, the, bottom, of, the, fuselage, re, creating, the, same, momentum, curtain, but, this, time, at, some, distance, from, the, bottom, of, the, craft, latimer, needham, and, cockerell, devised, a, 4, foot, 1, 2, m, high, skirt, design, which, was, fitted, to, the, sr, n1, to, produce, the, mk, v, displaying, hugely, improved, performance, with, the, ability, to, climb, over, obstacles, almost, as, high, as, the, skirt, in, october, 1961, latimer, needham, sold, his, skirt, patents, to, westland, who, had, recently, taken, over, saunders, roe, s, interest, in, the, hovercraft, experiments, with, the, skirt, design, demonstrated, a, problem, it, was, originally, expected, that, pressure, applied, to, the, outside, of, the, skirt, would, bend, it, inward, and, the, now, displaced, airflow, would, cause, it, to, pop, back, out, what, actually, happened, is, that, the, slight, narrowing, of, the, distance, between, the, walls, resulted, in, less, airflow, which, in, turn, led, to, more, air, loss, under, that, section, of, the, skirt, the, fuselage, above, this, area, would, drop, due, to, the, loss, of, lift, at, that, point, and, this, led, to, further, pressure, on, the, skirt, after, considerable, experimentation, denys, bliss, at, hovercraft, development, ltd, found, the, solution, to, this, problem, instead, of, using, two, separate, rubber, sheets, to, form, the, skirt, a, single, sheet, of, rubber, was, bent, into, a, u, shape, to, provide, both, sides, with, slots, cut, into, the, bottom, of, the, u, forming, the, annular, vent, when, deforming, pressure, was, applied, to, the, outside, of, this, design, air, pressure, in, the, rest, of, the, skirt, forced, the, inner, wall, to, move, in, as, well, keeping, the, channel, open, although, there, was, some, deformation, of, the, curtain, the, airflow, within, the, skirt, was, maintained, and, the, lift, remained, relatively, steady, over, time, this, design, evolved, into, individual, extensions, over, the, bottom, of, the, slots, in, the, skirt, known, as, fingers, through, these, improvements, the, hovercraft, became, an, effective, transport, system, for, high, speed, service, on, water, and, land, leading, to, widespread, developments, for, military, vehicles, search, and, rescue, and, commercial, operations, by, 1962, many, uk, aviation, and, shipbuilding, firms, were, working, on, hovercraft, designs, including, saunders, roe, westland, vickers, armstrong, william, denny, britten, norman, and, folland, small, scale, ferry, service, started, as, early, as, 1962, with, the, launch, of, the, vickers, armstrong, va, 3, with, the, introduction, of, the, 254, passenger, and, 30, car, carrying, sr, n4, cross, channel, ferry, by, hoverlloyd, and, seaspeed, in, 1968, hovercraft, had, developed, into, useful, commercial, craft, another, major, pioneering, effort, of, the, early, hovercraft, era, was, carried, out, by, jean, bertin, s, firm, in, france, bertin, was, an, advocate, of, the, multi, skirt, approach, which, used, a, number, of, smaller, cylindrical, skirts, instead, of, one, large, one, in, order, to, avoid, the, problems, noted, above, during, the, early, 1960s, he, developed, a, series, of, prototype, designs, which, he, called, terraplanes, if, they, were, aimed, for, land, use, and, naviplanes, for, water, the, best, known, of, these, designs, was, the, n500, naviplane, built, for, seaspeed, by, the, soci, t, d, etude, et, de, d, veloppement, des, a, roglisseurs, marins, sedam, the, n500, could, carry, 400, passengers, 55, cars, and, five, buses, it, set, a, speed, record, between, boulogne, and, dover, of, 74, kn, 137, km, h, it, was, rejected, by, its, operators, who, claimed, that, it, was, unreliable, another, discovery, was, that, the, total, amount, of, air, needed, to, lift, the, craft, was, a, function, of, the, roughness, of, the, surface, over, which, it, travelled, on, flat, surfaces, like, pavement, the, required, air, pressure, was, so, low, that, hovercraft, were, able, to, compete, in, energy, terms, with, conventional, systems, like, steel, wheels, however, the, hovercraft, lift, system, acted, as, both, a, lift, and, a, very, effective, suspension, and, thus, it, naturally, lent, itself, to, high, speed, use, where, conventional, suspension, systems, were, considered, too, complex, this, led, to, a, variety, of, hovertrain, proposals, during, the, 1960s, including, england, s, tracked, hovercraft, and, france, s, a, rotrain, in, the, u, s, rohr, inc, and, garrett, both, took, out, licences, to, develop, local, versions, of, the, a, rotrain, these, designs, competed, with, maglev, systems, in, the, high, speed, arena, where, their, primary, advantage, was, the, very, low, tech, tracks, they, needed, on, the, downside, the, air, blowing, dirt, and, trash, out, from, under, the, trains, presented, a, unique, problem, in, stations, and, interest, in, them, waned, in, the, 1970s, by, the, early, 1970s, the, basic, concept, had, been, well, developed, and, the, hovercraft, had, found, a, number, of, niche, roles, where, its, combination, of, features, were, advantageous, today, they, are, found, primarily, in, military, use, for, amphibious, operations, search, and, rescue, vehicles, in, shallow, water, and, sporting, vehicles, hovercraft, can, be, powered, by, one, or, more, engines, smaller, craft, such, as, the, sr, n6, usually, have, one, engine, with, the, drive, split, through, a, gearbox, on, vehicles, with, several, engines, one, usually, drives, the, fan, or, impeller, which, is, responsible, for, lifting, the, vehicle, by, forcing, high, pressure, air, under, the, craft, the, air, inflates, the, skirt, under, the, vehicle, causing, it, to, rise, above, the, surface, additional, engines, provide, thrust, in, order, to, propel, the, craft, some, hovercraft, use, ducting, to, allow, one, engine, to, perform, both, tasks, by, directing, some, of, the, air, to, the, skirt, the, rest, of, the, air, passing, out, of, the, back, to, push, the, craft, forward, the, british, aircraft, and, marine, engineering, company, saunders, roe, built, the, first, practical, human, carrying, hovercraft, for, the, national, research, development, corporation, the, sr, n1, which, carried, out, several, test, programmes, in, 1959, to, 1961, the, first, public, demonstration, was, in, 1959, including, a, cross, channel, test, run, in, july, 1959, piloted, by, peter, sheepy, lamb, an, ex, naval, test, pilot, and, the, chief, test, pilot, at, saunders, roe, christopher, cockerell, was, on, board, and, the, flight, took, place, on, the, 50th, anniversary, of, louis, bl, riot, s, first, aerial, crossing, the, sr, n1, was, driven, by, expelled, air, powered, by, a, single, piston, engine, demonstrated, at, the, farnborough, airshow, in, 1960, it, was, shown, that, this, simple, craft, can, carry, a, load, of, up, to, 12, marines, with, their, equipment, as, well, as, the, pilot, and, co, pilot, with, only, a, slight, reduction, in, hover, height, proportional, to, the, load, carried, the, sr, n1, did, not, have, any, skirt, using, instead, the, peripheral, air, principle, that, cockerell, had, patented, it, was, later, found, that, the, craft, s, hover, height, was, improved, by, the, addition, of, a, skirt, of, flexible, fabric, or, rubber, around, the, hovering, surface, to, contain, the, air, the, skirt, was, an, independent, invention, made, by, a, royal, navy, officer, c, h, latimer, needham, who, sold, his, idea, to, westland, by, then, the, parent, of, saunders, roe, s, helicopter, and, hovercraft, interests, and, who, worked, with, cockerell, to, develop, the, idea, further, the, first, passenger, carrying, hovercraft, to, enter, service, was, the, vickers, va, 3, which, in, the, summer, of, 1962, carried, passengers, regularly, along, the, north, wales, coast, from, moreton, merseyside, to, rhyl, it, was, powered, by, two, turboprop, aero, engines, and, driven, by, propellers, during, the, 1960s, saunders, roe, developed, several, larger, designs, that, could, carry, passengers, including, the, sr, n2, which, operated, across, the, solent, in, 1962, and, later, the, sr, n6, which, operated, across, the, solent, from, southsea, to, ryde, on, the, isle, of, wight, for, many, years, in, 1963, the, sr, n2, was, used, in, experimental, service, between, weston, super, mare, and, penarth, under, the, aegis, of, p, a, campbell, the, paddle, steamer, operators, operations, by, hovertravel, commenced, on, 24, july, 1965, using, the, sr, n6, which, carried, 38, passengers, two, 98, seat, ap1, 88, hovercraft, were, introduced, on, this, route, in, 1983, and, in, 2007, these, were, joined, by, the, first, 130, seat, bht130, craft, the, ap1, 88, and, the, bht130, were, notable, as, they, were, largely, built, by, hoverwork, using, shipbuilding, techniques, and, materials, i, e, welded, aluminium, structure, and, diesel, engines, rather, than, the, aircraft, techniques, used, to, build, the, earlier, craft, built, by, saunders, roe, british, hovercraft, corporation, over, 20, million, passengers, had, used, the, service, as, of, 2004, the, service, is, still, operating, as, of, 2020, and, is, by, far, the, longest, continuously, operated, hovercraft, service, in, 1966, two, cross, channel, passenger, hovercraft, services, were, inaugurated, using, sr, n6, hovercraft, hoverlloyd, ran, services, from, ramsgate, harbour, england, to, calais, france, and, townsend, ferries, also, started, a, service, to, calais, from, dover, which, was, soon, superseded, by, that, of, seaspeed, as, well, as, saunders, roe, and, vickers, which, combined, in, 1966, to, form, the, british, hovercraft, corporation, bhc, other, commercial, craft, were, developed, during, the, 1960s, in, the, uk, by, cushioncraft, part, of, the, britten, norman, group, and, hovermarine, based, at, woolston, the, latter, being, sidewall, hovercraft, where, the, sides, of, the, hull, projected, down, into, the, water, to, trap, the, cushion, of, air, with, normal, hovercraft, skirts, at, the, bow, and, stern, one, of, these, models, the, hm, 2, was, used, by, red, funnel, between, southampton, near, the, woolston, floating, bridge, and, cowes, the, world, s, first, car, carrying, hovercraft, was, made, in, 1968, the, bhc, mountbatten, class, sr, n4, models, each, powered, by, four, bristol, proteus, turboshaft, engines, these, were, both, used, by, rival, operators, hoverlloyd, and, seaspeed, which, joined, to, form, hoverspeed, in, 1981, to, operate, regular, car, and, passenger, carrying, services, across, the, english, channel, hoverlloyd, operated, from, ramsgate, where, a, special, hoverport, had, been, built, at, pegwell, bay, to, calais, seaspeed, operated, from, dover, england, to, calais, and, boulogne, in, france, the, first, sr, n4, had, a, capacity, of, 254, passengers, and, 30, cars, and, a, top, speed, of, 83, kn, 154, km, h, the, channel, crossing, took, around, 30, minutes, and, was, run, like, an, airline, with, flight, numbers, the, later, sr, n4, mk, iii, had, a, capacity, of, 418, passengers, and, 60, cars, these, were, later, joined, by, the, french, built, sedam, n500, naviplane, with, a, capacity, of, 385, passengers, and, 45, cars, only, one, entered, service, and, was, used, intermittently, for, a, few, years, on, the, cross, channel, service, until, returned, to, sncf, in, 1983, the, service, ceased, on, 1, october, 2000, after, 32, years, due, to, competition, with, traditional, ferries, catamarans, the, disappearance, of, duty, free, shopping, within, the, eu, the, advancing, age, of, the, sr, n4, hovercraft, and, the, opening, of, the, channel, tunnel, the, commercial, success, of, hovercraft, suffered, from, rapid, rises, in, fuel, prices, during, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, following, conflict, in, the, middle, east, alternative, over, water, vehicles, such, as,

equivalent, of, the, u, s, navy, lcac, the, finnish, navy, designed, an, experimental, missile, attack, hovercraft, class, tuuli, class, hovercraft, in, the, late, 1990s, the, prototype, of, the, class, tuuli, was, commissioned, in, 2000, it, proved, an, extremely, successful, design, for, a, littoral, fast, attack, craft, but, due, to, fiscal, reasons, and, doctrinal, change, in, the, navy, the, hovercraft, was, soon, withdrawn, the, iranian, navy, operates, multiple, british, made, and, some, iranian, produced, hovercraft, the, tondar, or, thunderbolt, comes, in, varieties, designed, for, combat, and, transportation, iran, has, equipped, the, tondar, with, mid, range, missiles, machine, guns, and, retrievable, reconnaissance, drones, currently, they, are, used, for, water, patrols, and, combat, against, drug, smugglers, the, soviet, union, was, the, world, s, largest, developer, of, military, hovercraft, their, designs, range, from, the, small, czilim, class, hovercraft, comparable, to, the, sr, n6, to, the, monstrous, zubr, class, landing, craft, the, world, s, largest, hovercraft, the, soviet, union, was, also, one, of, the, first, nations, to, use, a, hovercraft, the, bora, as, a, guided, missile, corvette, though, it, is, more, properly, classified, as, a, surface, effect, ship, because, it, has, rigid, non, inflatable, sides, with, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, most, soviet, military, hovercraft, fell, into, disuse, and, disrepair, only, recently, has, the, modern, russian, navy, begun, building, new, classes, of, military, hovercraft, the, first, application, of, the, hovercraft, for, military, use, was, by, the, british, armed, forces, using, hovercraft, built, by, saunders, roe, in, 1961, the, united, kingdom, set, up, the, interservice, hovercraft, trials, unit, ihtu, based, at, rnas, lee, on, solent, hms, daedalus, now, the, site, of, the, hovercraft, museum, near, portsmouth, this, unit, carried, out, trials, on, the, sr, n1, from, mk1, through, mk5, as, well, as, testing, the, sr, n2, sr, n3, sr, n5, and, sr, n6, craft, the, hovercraft, trials, unit, far, east, was, established, by, the, royal, navy, at, singapore, in, august, 1964, with, two, armed, hovercraft, they, were, deployed, later, that, year, to, tawau, in, malaysian, borneo, and, operated, on, waterways, there, during, the, indonesia, malaysia, confrontation, the, hovercraft, s, inventor, sir, christopher, cockerell, claimed, late, in, his, life, that, the, falklands, war, could, have, been, won, far, more, easily, had, the, british, military, shown, more, commitment, to, the, hovercraft, although, earlier, trials, had, been, conducted, in, the, falkland, islands, with, an, srn, 6, the, hovercraft, unit, had, been, disbanded, by, the, time, of, the, conflict, currently, the, royal, marines, use, the, griffonhoverwork, 2400td, hovercraft, the, replacement, for, the, griffon, 2000, tdx, class, acv, which, was,

trial, to, the, vietnam, war, by, the, united, states, navy, as, pacv, patrol, craft, in, the, mekong, delta, where, their, mobility, and, speed, was, unique, this, was, used, in, both, the, uk, sr, n5, curved, deck, configuration, and, later, with, modified, flat, deck, gun, turret, and, grenade, launcher, designated, the, 9255, pacv, the, united, states, army, also, experimented, with, the, use, of, sr, n5, hovercraft, in, vietnam, three, hovercraft, with, the, flat, deck, configuration, were, deployed, to, ng, t, m, in, the, mekong, delta, region, and, later, to, ben, luc, they, saw, action, primarily, in, the, plain, of, reeds, one, was, destroyed, in, early, 1970, and, another, in, august, of, that, same, year, after, which, the, unit, was, disbanded, the, only, remaining, u, s, army, sr, n5, hovercraft, is, currently, on, display, in, the, army, transport, museum, in, virginia, experience, led, to, the, proposed, bell, sk, 10, which, was, the, basis, for, the, lcac, class, air, cushioned, landing, craft, now, deployed, by, the, u, s, and, japanese, navy, developed, and, tested, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, lacv, 30, was, used, by, the, us, army, to, transport, military, cargo, in, logistics, over, the, shore, operations, from, the, early, 1980s, until, the, mid, 1990s, small, commercially, manufactured, kit, or, plan, built, hovercraft, are, increasingly, being, used, for, recreational, purposes, such, as, inland, racing, and, cruising, on, inland, lakes, and, rivers, marshy, areas, estuaries, and, inshore, coastal, waters, the, hovercraft, cruising, club, supports, the, use, of, hovercraft, for, cruising, in, coastal, and, inland, waterways, lakes, and, lochs, the, hovercraft, club, of, great, britain, founded, in, 1966, regularly, organizes, inland, and, coastal, hovercraft, race, events, at, various, venues, across, the, united, kingdom, similar, events, are, also, held, in, europe, and, the, us, in, august, 2010, the, hovercraft, club, of, great, britain, hosted, the, world, hovercraft, championships, at, towcester, racecourse, followed, by, the, 2016, world, hovercraft, championships, at, the, west, midlands, water, ski, centre, in, tamworth, the, world, hovercraft, championships, are, run, under, the, auspices, of, the, world, hovercraft, federation, so, far, the, world, hovercraft, championships, had, been, hosted, by, france, 1993, in, verneuil, 1997, in, lucon, 2006, at, the, lac, de, tolerme, germany, 1987, in, bad, karlshafen, 2004, in, berlin, 2012, and, 2018, in, saalburg, portugal, 1995, in, peso, de, la, regua, sweden, 2008, and, 2022, at, flottbro, ski, centre, in, huddinge, uk, 1991, and, 2000, at, weston, parc, us, 1989, in, troy, ohio, 2002, in, terre, haute, the, 2020, world, hovercraft, championships, had, to, be, postponed, to, 2022, due, to, restriction, caused, by, the, covid, 19, outbreak, apart, from, the, craft, designed, as, racing, hovercraft, which, are, often, only, suitable, for, racing, there, is, another, form, of, small, personal, hovercraft, for, leisure, use, often, referred, to, as, cruising, hovercraft, capable, of, carrying, up, to, four, people, just, like, their, full, size, counterparts, the, ability, of, these, small, personal, hovercraft, to, safely, cross, all, types, of, terrain, e, g, water, sandbanks, swamps, ice, etc, and, reach, places, often, inaccessible, by, any, other, type, of, craft, makes, them, suitable, for, a, number, of, roles, such, as, survey, work, and, patrol, and, rescue, duties, in, addition, to, personal, leisure, use, increasingly, these, craft, are, being, used, as, yacht, tenders, enabling, yacht, owners, and, guests, to, travel, from, a, waiting, yacht, to, for, example, a, secluded, beach, in, this, role, small, hovercraft, can, offer, a, more, entertaining, alternative, to, the, usual, small, boat, and, can, be, a, rival, for, the, jet, ski, the, excitement, of, a, personal, hovercraft, can, now, be, enjoyed, at, experience, days, which, are, popular, with, families, friends, and, those, in, business, who, often, see, them, as, team, building, exercises, this, level, of, interest, has, naturally, led, to, a, hovercraft, rental, sector, and, numerous, manufacturers, of, small, ready, built, designs, of, personal, hovercraft, to, serve, the, need, a, real, benefit, of, air, cushion, vehicles, in, moving, heavy, loads, over, difficult, terrain, such, as, swamps, was, overlooked, by, the, excitement, of, the, british, government, funding, to, develop, high, speed, hovercraft, it, was, not, until, the, early, 1970s, that, the, technology, was, used, for, moving, a, modular, marine, barge, with, a, dragline, on, board, for, use, over, soft, reclaimed, land, mackace, mackley, air, cushion, equipment, now, known, as, hovertrans, produced, a, number, of, successful, hoverbarges, such, as, the, 250, ton, payload, sea, pearl, which, operated, in, abu, dhabi, and, the, twin, 160, ton, payload, yukon, princesses, which, ferried, trucks, across, the, yukon, river, to, aid, the, pipeline, build, hoverbarges, are, still, in, operation, today, in, 2006, hovertrans, formed, by, the, original, managers, of, mackace, launched, a, 330, ton, payload, drilling, barge, in, the, swamps, of, suriname, the, hoverbarge, technology, is, somewhat, different, from, high, speed, hovercraft, which, has, traditionally, been, constructed, using, aircraft, technology, the, initial, concept, of, the, air, cushion, barge, has, always, been, to, provide, a, low, tech, amphibious, solution, for, accessing, construction, sites, using, typical, equipment, found, in, this, area, such, as, diesel, engines, ventilating, fans, winches, and, marine, equipment, the, load, to, move, a, 200, ton, payload, acv, barge, at, 5, kn, 9, 3, km, h, would, only, be, 5, tons, the, skirt, and, air, distribution, design, on, high, speed, craft, again, is, more, complex, as, they, have, to, cope, with, the, air, cushion, being, washed, out, by, a, wave, and, wave, impact, the, slow, speed, and, large, mono, chamber, of, the, hover, barge, actually, helps, reduce, the, effect, of, wave, action, giving, a, very, smooth, ride, the, low, pull, force, enabled, a, boeing, 107, helicopter, to, pull, a, hoverbarge, across, snow, ice, and, water, in, 1982, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, adopt, air, cushion, technology, for, use, in, fixed, track, systems, in, order, to, use, the, lower, frictional, forces, for, delivering, high, speeds, the, most, advanced, example, of, this, was, the, a, rotrain, an, experimental, high, speed, hovertrain, built, and, operated, in, france, between, 1965, and, 1977, the, project, was, abandoned, in, 1977, due, to, lack, of, funding, the, death, of, its, lead, engineer, and, the, adoption, of, the, tgv, by, the, french, government, as, its, high, speed, ground, transport, solution, a, test, track, for, a, tracked, hovercraft, system, was, built, at, earith, near, cambridge, england, it, ran, southwest, from, sutton, gault, sandwiched, between, the, old, bedford, river, and, the, smaller, counter, drain, to, the, west, careful, examination, of, the, site, will, still, reveal, traces, of, the, concrete, piers, used, to, support, the, structure, the, actual, vehicle, rtv31, is, preserved, at, railworld, in, peterborough, and, can, be, seen, from, trains, just, south, west, of, peterborough, railway, station, the, vehicle, achieved, 104, mph, 167, km, h, on, 7, february, 1973, but, the, project, was, cancelled, a, week, later, the, project, was, managed, by, tracked, hovercraft, ltd, with, denys, bliss, as, director, in, the, early, 1970s, then, axed, by, the, aerospace, minister, michael, heseltine, records, of, this, project, are, available, from, the, correspondence, and, papers, of, sir, harry, legge, bourke, mp, at, leeds, university, library, heseltine, was, accused, by, airey, neave, and, others, of, misleading, the, house, of, commons, when, he, stated, that, the, government, was, still, considering, giving, financial, support, to, the, hovertrain, when, the, decision, to, pull, the, plug, had, already, been, taken, by, the, cabinet, after, the, cambridge, project, was, abandoned, due, to, financial, constraints, parts, of, the, project, were, picked, up, by, the, engineering, firm, alfred, mcalpine, and, abandoned, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, tracked, hovercraft, project, and, professor, laithwaite, s, maglev, train, system, were, contemporaneous, and, there, was, intense, competition, between, the, two, prospective, british, systems, for, funding, and, credibility, at, the, other, end, of, the, speed, spectrum, the, u, bahn, serfaus, has, been, in, continuous, operation, since, 1985, this, is, an, unusual, underground, air, cushion, funicular, rapid, transit, system, situated, in, the, austrian, ski, resort, of, serfaus, only, 1, 280, m, 4, 200, ft, long, the, line, reaches, a, maximum, speed, of, 25, mph, 40, km, h, a, similar, system, also, exists, in, narita, international, airport, near, tokyo, japan, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, the, u, s, department, of, transport, s, urban, mass, transit, administration, umta, funded, several, hovertrain, projects, which, were, known, as, tracked, air, cushion, vehicles, or, tacvs, they, were, also, known, as, aerotrains, since, one, of, the, builders, had, a, licence, from, bertin, s, aerotrain, company, three, separate, projects, were, funded, research, and, development, was, carried, out, by, rohr, inc, garrett, airesearch, and, grumman, umta, built, an, extensive, test, site, in, pueblo, colorado, with, different, types, of, tracks, for, the, different, technologies, used, by, the, prototype, contractors, they, managed, to, build, prototypes, and, do, a, few, test, runs, before, the, funding, was, cut, from, the, 1960s, to, 1980s, heavy, haulers, in, the, uk, used, an, air, cushion, system, for, their, hydraulic, modular, trailers, to, carry, overweight, loads, over, bridges, which, were, not, able, to, bear, the, weight, of, the, load, and, the, trailer, the, central, electricity, generating, board, had, to, move, transformers, from, one, place, to, another, which, weighed, from, 150, tons, to, 300, tons, for, which, they, did, not, have, appropriate, equipment, so, they, hired, heavy, haulers, like, wynns, and, pickfords, who, had, specialized, equipment, like, hydraulic, modular, trailers, manufactured, by, nicolas, and, cometto, and, ballast, tractors, from, scammell, which, were, strong, and, powerful, enough, to, carry, the, load, this, made, the, transportation, efficient, by, avoiding, bridge, reinforcement, in, some, cases, costing, 30, 000, the, transformers, were, loaded, into, the, girder, frame, of, the, hydraulic, modular, trailer, with, axle, lines, in, front, and, behind, of, the, transformer, which, made, it, possible, to, keep, the, transformer, as, low, as, possible, to, the, ground, to, negotiate, obstacles, on, the, route, air, cushions, were, mounted, under, the, girder, frame, s, surface, and, were, operated, by, a, compressor, vehicle, which, was, a, customized, commer, 16, ton, maxiload, provided, by, cegb, the, vehicle, was, loaded, with, 4, air, compressors, powered, by, a, rolls, royce, engine, producing, 235, bhp, while, negotiating, a, bridge, the, air, cushions, were, inflated, and, that, reduced, the, stress, tremendously, on, the, bridge, without, this, technology, the, government, would, have, had, to, rebuild, the, bridges, which, was, not, feasible, just, to, carry, a, small, number, of, loads, the, hoover, constellation, was, a, spherical, canister, type, vacuum, cleaner, notable, for, its, lack, of, wheels, floating, on, a, cushion, of, air, it, was, a, domestic, hovercraft, they, were, not, especially, good, as, vacuum, cleaners, as, the, air, escaping, from, under, the, cushion, blew, uncollected, dust, in, all, directions, nor, as, hovercraft, as, their, lack, of, a, skirt, meant, that, they, only, hovered, effectively, over, a, smooth, surface, despite, this, original, constellations, are, sought, after, collectibles, today, the, flymo, is, an, air, cushion, lawn, mower, that, uses, a, fan, on, the, cutter, blade, to, provide, lift, this, allows, it, to, be, moved, in, any, direction, and, provides, double, duty,
