fine, art, photography, is, photography, created, in, line, with, the, vision, of, the, photographer, as, artist, using, photography, as, a, medium, for, creative, expression, the, goal, of, fine, art, photography, is, to, express, an, idea, a, message, or, an, emotion, this, stands, in, contrast, to, representational, photography, such, as, photojournalism, which, provides, a, documentary, visual, account, of, specific, subjects, and, events, literally, representing, objective, reality, rather, than, the, subjective, intent, of, the, photographer, and, commercial, photography, the, primary, focus, of, which, is, to, advertise, products, or, services, one, photography, historian, claimed, that, the, earliest, exponent, of, fine, art, or, composition, photography, was, john, edwin, mayall, who, exhibited, daguerreotypes, illustrating, the, lord, s, prayer, in, 1851, successful, attempts, to, make, fine, art, photography, can, be, traced, to, victorian, era, practitioners, such, as, julia, margaret, cameron, charles, lutwidge, dodgson, and, oscar, gustave, rejlander, and, others, in, the, u, s, f, holland, day, alfred, stieglitz, and, edward, steichen, were, instrumental, in, making, photography, a, fine, art, and, stieglitz, was, especially, notable, in, introducing, it, into, museum, collections, in, the, uk, as, recently, as, 1960, photography, was, not, really, recognised, as, a, fine, art, s, d, jouhar, said, when, he, formed, the, photographic, fine, art, association, at, that, time, at, the, moment, photography, is, not, generally, recognized, as, anything, more, than, a, craft, in, the, usa, photography, has, been, openly, accepted, as, fine, art, in, certain, official, quarters, it, is, shown, in, galleries, and, exhibitions, as, an, art, there, is, not, corresponding, recognition, in, this, country, the, london, salon, shows, pictorial, photography, but, it, is, not, generally, understood, as, an, art, whether, a, work, shows, aesthetic, qualities, or, not, it, is, designated, pictorial, photography, which, is, a, very, ambiguous, term, the, photographer, himself, must, have, confidence, in, his, work, and, in, its, dignity, and, aesthetic, value, to, force, recognition, as, an, art, rather, than, a, craft, until, the, late, 1970s, several, genres, predominated, such, as, nudes, portraits, and, natural, landscapes, exemplified, by, ansel, adams, breakthrough, star, artists, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, such, as, sally, mann, robert, mapplethorpe, robert, farber, and, cindy, sherman, still, relied, heavily, on, such, genres, although, seeing, them, with, fresh, eyes, others, investigated, a, snapshot, aesthetic, approach, in, the, mid, 1970s, josef, h, neumann, developed, chemograms, which, are, products, of, both, photographic, processing, and, painting, on, photographic, paper, before, the, spread, of, computers, and, the, use, of, image, processing, software, the, process, of, creating, chemograms, can, be, considered, an, early, form, of, analog, post, production, in, which, the, original, image, is, altered, after, the, enlarging, process, unlike, works, of, digital, post, production, each, chemogram, is, a, unique, piece, american, organizations, such, as, the, aperture, foundation, and, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, have, done, much, to, keep, photography, at, the, forefront, of, the, fine, arts, moma, s, establishment, of, a, department, of, photography, in, 1940, and, appointment, of, beaumont, newhall, as, its, first, curator, are, often, cited, as, institutional, confirmation, of, photography, s, status, as, an, art, there, is, now, a, trend, toward, a, careful, staging, and, lighting, of, the, picture, rather, than, hoping, to, discover, it, ready, made, photographers, such, as, gregory, crewdson, and, jeff, wall, are, noted, for, the, quality, of, their, staged, pictures, additionally, new, technological, trends, in, digital, photography, have, opened, a, new, direction, in, full, spectrum, photography, where, careful, filtering, choices, across, the, ultraviolet, visible, and, infrared, lead, to, new, artistic, visions, as, printing, technologies, have, improved, since, around, 1980, a, photographer, s, art, prints, reproduced, in, a, finely, printed, limited, edition, book, have, now, become, an, area, of, strong, interest, to, collectors, this, is, because, books, usually, have, high, production, values, a, short, print, run, and, their, limited, market, means, they, are, almost, never, reprinted, the, collector, s, market, in, photography, books, by, individual, photographers, is, developing, rapidly, according, to, art, market, trends, 2004, 7, 000, photographs, were, sold, in, auction, rooms, in, 2004, and, photographs, averaged, a, 7, 6, percent, annual, price, rise, from, 1994, and, 2004, around, 80, percent, were, sold, in, the, united, states, although, auction, sales, only, record, a, fraction, of, total, private, sales, there, is, now, a, thriving, collectors, market, for, which, the, most, sought, after, art, photographers, will, produce, high, quality, archival, prints, in, strictly, limited, editions, attempts, by, online, art, retailers, to, sell, fine, photography, to, the, general, public, alongside, prints, of, paintings, have, had, mixed, results, with, strong, sales, coming, only, from, the, traditional, major, photographers, such, as, ansel, adams, in, addition, to, the, digital, movement, towards, manipulation, filtering, or, resolution, changes, some, fine, artists, deliberately, seek, a, naturalistic, including, natural, lighting, as, a, value, in, itself, sometimes, the, art, work, as, in, the, case, of, gerhard, richter, consists, of, a, photographic, image, that, has, been, subsequently, painted, over, with, oil, paints, and, or, contains, some, political, or, historical, significance, beyond, the, image, itself, the, existence, of, photographically, projected, painting, now, blurs, the, line, between, painting, and, photography, which, traditionally, was, absolute, until, the, mid, 1950s, it, was, widely, considered, vulgar, and, pretentious, to, frame, a, photograph, for, a, gallery, exhibition, prints, were, usually, simply, pasted, onto, blockboard, or, plywood, or, given, a, white, border, in, the, darkroom, and, then, pinned, at, the, corners, onto, display, boards, prints, were, thus, shown, without, any, glass, reflections, obscuring, them, steichen, s, famous, the, family, of, man, exhibition, was, unframed, the, pictures, pasted, to, panels, even, as, late, as, 1966, bill, brandt, s, moma, show, was, unframed, with, simple, prints, pasted, to, thin, plywood, from, the, mid, 1950s, to, about, 2000, most, gallery, exhibitions, had, prints, behind, glass, since, about, 2000, there, has, been, a, noticeable, move, toward, once, again, showing, contemporary, gallery, prints, on, boards, and, without, glass, in, addition, throughout, the, twentieth, century, there, was, a, noticeable, increase, in, the, size, of, prints, fine, art, photography, is, created, primarily, as, an, expression, of, the, artist, s, vision, but, as, a, byproduct, it, has, also, been, important, in, advancing, certain, causes, the, work, of, ansel, adams, in, yosemite, and, yellowstone, provides, an, example, adams, is, one, of, the, most, widely, recognized, fine, art, photographers, of, the, 20th, century, and, was, an, avid, promoter, of, conservation, while, his, primary, focus, was, on, photography, as, art, some, of, his, work, raised, public, awareness, of, the, beauty, of, the, sierra, nevada, and, helped, to, build, political, support, for, their, protection, such, photography, has, also, had, effects, in, the, area, of, censorship, law, and, free, expression, due, to, its, concern, with, the, nude, body, although, fine, art, photography, may, overlap, with, many, other, genres, of, photography, the, overlaps, with, fashion, photography, and, photojournalism, merit, special, attention, in, 1996, it, was, stated, that, there, had, been, a, recent, blurring, of, lines, between, commercial, illustrative, photography, and, fine, art, photography, especially, in, the, area, of, fashion, evidence, for, the, overlap, of, fine, art, photography, and, fashion, photography, includes, lectures, exhibitions, trade, fairs, such, as, art, basel, miami, beach, and, books, photojournalism, and, fine, art, photography, overlapped, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, when, news, photographers, struck, up, liaisons, with, art, photography, and, painting, in, 1974, the, international, center, of, photography, opened, with, emphases, on, both, humanitarian, photojournalism, and, art, photography, by, 1987, pictures, that, were, taken, on, assignments, for, magazines, and, newspapers, now, regularly, reappear, in, frames, on, the, walls, of, museums, and, galleries, smartphone, apps, such, as, snapchat, sometimes, are, used, for, fine, art, photography, the, reactions, of, artists, and, writers, have, contributed, significantly, to, perceptions, of, photography, as, fine, art, prominent, painters, have, asserted, their, interest, in, the, medium, i, have, always, been, very, interested, in, photography, i, have, looked, at, far, more, photographs, than, i, have, paintings, because, their, reality, is, stronger, than, reality, itself, noted, authors, similarly, have, responded, to, the, artistic, potential, of, photography, it, does, seem, to, me, that, capa, has, proved, beyond, all, doubt, that, the, camera, need, not, be, a, cold, mechanical, device, like, the, pen, it, is, as, good, as, the, man, who, uses, it, it, can,
