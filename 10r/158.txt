environmental, structural, mechanical, electrical, computational, embeddable, and, other, research, domains, it, is, related, to, architecture, mechatronics, engineering, computer, engineering, aerospace, engineering, and, civil, engineering, but, distinguished, from, interior, design, and, architectural, design, as, an, art, and, science, of, designing, infrastructure, through, these, various, engineering, disciplines, from, which, properly, align, with, many, related, surrounding, engineering, advancements, from, reduction, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, to, the, construction, of, resilient, buildings, architectural, engineers, are, at, the, forefront, of, addressing, several, major, challenges, of, the, 21st, century, they, apply, the, latest, scientific, knowledge, and, technologies, to, the, design, of, buildings, architectural, engineering, as, a, relatively, new, licensed, profession, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, the, rapid, technological, developments, architectural, engineers, are, at, the, forefront, of, two, major, historical, opportunities, that, today, s, world, is, immersed, in, 1, that, of, rapidly, advancing, computer, technology, and, 2, the, parallel, revolution, of, environmental, sustainability, architects, and, architectural, engineers, both, play, crucial, roles, in, building, design, and, construction, but, they, focus, on, different, aspects, architectural, engineers, specialize, in, the, technical, and, structural, aspects, ensuring, buildings, are, safe, efficient, and, sustainable, their, education, blends, architecture, with, engineering, focusing, on, structural, integrity, mechanical, systems, and, energy, efficiency, they, design, and, analyze, building, systems, conduct, feasibility, studies, and, collaborate, with, architects, to, integrate, technical, requirements, into, the, overall, design, architects, on, the, other, hand, emphasize, the, aesthetic, functional, and, spatial, elements, developing, design, concepts, and, detailed, plans, to, meet, client, needs, and, comply, with, regulations, their, education, focuses, on, design, theory, history, and, artistic, aspects, and, they, oversee, the, construction, process, to, ensure, the, design, is, correctly, implemented, mechanical, engineering, and, electrical, engineering, engineers, are, specialists, when, engaged, in, the, building, design, fields, this, is, known, as, mechanical, electrical, and, plumbing, mep, throughout, the, united, states, or, building, services, engineering, in, the, united, kingdom, canada, and, australia, mechanical, engineers, often, design, and, oversee, the, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, plumbing, and, rainwater, systems, plumbing, designers, often, include, design, specifications, for, simple, active, fire, protection, systems, but, for, more, complicated, projects, fire, protection, engineers, are, often, separately, retained, electrical, engineers, are, responsible, for, the, building, s, power, distribution, telecommunication, fire, alarm, signalization, lightning, protection, and, control, systems, as, well, as, lighting, systems, structural, engineering, involves, the, analysis, and, design, of, the, built, environment, buildings, bridges, equipment, supports, towers, and, walls, those, concentrating, on, buildings, are, sometimes, informally, referred, to, as, building, engineers, structural, engineers, require, expertise, in, strength, of, materials, structural, analysis, and, in, predicting, structural, load, such, as, from, weight, of, the, building, occupants, and, contents, and, extreme, events, such, as, wind, rain, ice, and, seismic, design, of, structures, which, is, referred, to, as, earthquake, engineering, architectural, engineers, sometimes, incorporate, structural, as, one, aspect, of, their, designs, the, structural, discipline, when, practiced, as, a, specialty, works, closely, with, architects, and, other, engineering, specialists, sustainable, engineering, involves, designing, or, operating, systems, to, use, energy, and, resources, in, a, way, that, maintains, environmental, balance, and, ensures, that, future, generations, can, meet, their, own, needs, without, compromising, the, natural, environment, architectural, engineers, are, influenced, by, sustainable, engineering, principles, in, their, education, training, and, practice, integrating, sustainable, design, strategies, to, create, buildings, and, structures, that, minimize, environmental, impact, and, enhance, energy, efficiency, building, enclosure, and, fa, ade, engineering, involves, the, design, and, management, of, the, outer, shell, of, a, building, which, acts, as, a, barrier, between, the, interior, and, exterior, environments, this, includes, walls, roofs, windows, doors, and, other, components, that, collectively, ensure, the, building, is, protected, from, external, elements, such, as, air, water, heat, light, and, noise, the, building, envelope, plays, a, crucial, role, in, maintaining, indoor, comfort, by, controlling, temperature, humidity, and, airflow, it, also, contributes, to, the, building, s, energy, efficiency, by, minimizing, heat, loss, in, the, winter, and, heat, gain, in, the, summer, engineers, in, this, field, work, on, making, sure, the, envelope, is, structurally, sound, aesthetically, pleasing, and, performs, effectively, to, meet, various, functional, requirements, fire, protection, engineering, is, a, subfield, of, building, engineering, focused, on, the, design, and, application, of, systems, and, practices, that, prevent, control, and, mitigate, the, impact, of, fires, this, discipline, aims, to, protect, people, property, and, the, environment, from, the, destructive, effects, of, fire, through, a, combination, of, preventive, measures, detection, systems, and, response, strategies, fire, protection, engineers, use, their, expertise, to, analyze, potential, fire, scenarios, model, the, spread, of, fire, and, smoke, and, design, systems, that, effectively, protect, lives, and, property, they, collaborate, with, architects, builders, and, safety, officials, to, integrate, fire, protection, measures, into, the, overall, design, and, operation, of, buildings, and, facilities, acoustical, or, acoustics, engineering, in, building, design, focuses, on, controlling, sound, within, and, around, buildings, to, create, a, comfortable, and, functional, auditory, environment, this, discipline, involves, the, study, and, application, of, principles, to, manage, noise, levels, improve, sound, quality, and, ensure, effective, sound, insulation, acoustical, engineers, work, closely, with, architects, builders, and, other, engineers, to, integrate, sound, control, measures, into, the, overall, design, of, a, building, they, use, advanced, modeling, and, simulation, tools, to, predict, how, sound, will, behave, in, different, spaces, and, employ, various, materials, and, techniques, to, achieve, the, desired, acoustic, performance, their, goal, is, to, create, environments, that, are, acoustically, comfortable, meeting, the, specific, needs, of, the, building, s, occupants, and, its, intended, use, in, many, jurisdictions, of, the, united, states, the, architectural, engineer, is, a, licensed, engineering, professional, usually, a, graduate, of, an, eac, abet, accredited, architectural, engineering, university, program, preparing, students, to, perform, whole, building, design, in, competition, with, architect, engineer, teams, or, for, practice, in, one, of, structural, mechanical, or, electrical, fields, of, building, design, but, with, an, appreciation, of, integrated, architectural, requirements, although, some, states, require, a, bs, degree, from, an, eac, abet, accredited, engineering, program, with, no, exceptions, about, two, thirds, of, the, states, accept, bs, degrees, from, etac, abet, accredited, architectural, engineering, technology, programs, to, become, licensed, engineering, professionals, architectural, engineering, technology, graduates, with, applied, engineering, skills, often, gain, further, learning, with, an, ms, degree, in, engineering, and, or, naab, accredited, masters, of, architecture, to, become, licensed, as, both, an, engineer, and, architect, this, path, requires, the, individual, to, pass, state, licensing, exams, in, both, disciplines, states, handle, this, situation, differently, on, experienced, gained, working, under, a, licensed, engineer, and, or, registered, architect, prior, to, taking, the, examinations, this, education, model, is, more, in, line, with, the, educational, system, in, the, united, kingdom, where, an, accredited, meng, or, ms, degree, in, engineering, for, further, learning, is, required, by, the, engineering, council, to, be, registered, as, a, chartered, engineer, the, national, council, of, architectural, registration, boards, ncarb, facilitate, the, licensure, and, credentialing, of, architects, but, requirements, for, registration, often, vary, between, states, in, the, state, of, new, jersey, a, registered, architect, is, allowed, to, sit, for, the, pe, exam, and, a, professional, engineer, is, allowed, to, take, the, design, portions, of, the, architectural, registration, exam, are, to, become, a, registered, architect, formal, architectural, engineering, education, following, the, engineering, model, of, earlier, disciplines, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, became, widespread, in, the, united, states, by, the, mid, 20th, century, with, the, establishment, of, a, specific, architectural, engineering, ncees, professional, engineering, registration, examination, in, the, 1990s, and, first, offering, in, april, 2003, architectural, engineering, became, recognized, as, a, distinct, engineering, discipline, in, the, united, states, up, to, date, ncees, account, allows, engineers, to, apply, to, other, states, pe, license, by, comity, in, most, license, regulated, jurisdictions, architectural, engineers, are, not, entitled, to, practice, architecture, unless, they, are, also, licensed, as, architects, practice, of, structural, engineering, in, high, risk, locations, e, g, due, to, strong, earthquakes, or, on, specific, types, of, higher, importance, buildings, such, as, hospitals, may, require, separate, licensing, as, well, regulations, and, customary, practice, vary, widely, by, state, or, city, in, some, countries, the, practice, of, architecture, includes, planning, designing, and, overseeing, the, building, s, construction, and, architecture, as, a, profession, providing, architectural, services, is, referred, to, as, architectural, engineering, in, japan, a, first, class, architect, plays, the, dual, role, of, architect, and, building, engineer, although, the, services, of, a, licensed, structural, design, first, class, architect, are, required, for, buildings, over, a, certain, scale, in, some, languages, such, as, korean, and, arabic, architect, is, literally, translated, as, architectural, engineer, in, some, countries, an, architectural, engineer, such, as, the, ingegnere, edile, in, italy, is, entitled, to, practice, architecture, and, is, often, referred, to, as, an, architect, these, individuals, are, often, also, structural, engineers, in, other, countries, such, as, germany, austria, iran, and, most, of, the, arab, countries, architecture, graduates, receive, an, engineering, degree, dipl, ing, diplom, ingenieur, in, spain, an, architect, has, a, technical, university, education, and, legal, powers, to, carry, out, building, structure, and, facility, projects, in, brazil, architects, and, engineers, used, to, share, the, same, accreditation, process, conselho, federal, de, engenheiros, arquitetos, e, agr, nomos, confea, federal, council, of, engineering, architecture, and, agronomy, now, the, brazilian, architects, and, urbanists, have, their, own, accreditation, process, cau, architecture, and, urbanism, council, besides, traditional, architecture, design, training, brazilian, architecture, courses, also, offer, complementary, training, in, engineering, disciplines, such, as, structural, electrical, hydraulic, and, mechanical, engineering, after, graduation, architects, focus, in, architectural, planning, yet, they, can, be, responsible, to, the, whole, building, when, it, concerns, to, small, buildings, except, in, electric, wiring, where, the, architect, autonomy, is, limited, to, systems, up, to, 30kva, and, it, has, to, be, done, by, an, electrical, engineer, applied, to, buildings, urban, environment, built, cultural, heritage, landscape, planning, interiorscape, planning, and, regional, planning, in, greece, licensed, architectural, engineers, are, graduates, from, architecture, faculties, that, belong, to, the, polytechnic, university, obtaining, an, engineering, diploma, they, graduate, after, 5, years, of, studies, and, are, fully, entitled, architects, once, they, become, members, of, the, technical, chamber, of, greece, tee, the, technical, chamber, of, greece, has, more, than, 100, 000, members, encompassing, all, the, engineering, disciplines, as, well, as, architecture, a, prerequisite, for, being, a, member, is, to, be, licensed, as, a, qualified, engineer, or, architect, and, to, be, a, graduate, of, an, engineering, and, architecture, schools, of, a, greek, university, or, of, an, equivalent, school, from, abroad, the, technical, chamber, of, greece, is, the, authorized, body, to, provide, work, licenses, to, engineers, of, all, disciplines, as, well, as, architects, graduated, in, greece, or, abroad, the, license, is, awarded, after, examinations, the, examinations, take, place, three, to, four, times, a, year, the, engineering, diploma, equals, a, master, s, degree, in, ects, units, 300, according, to, the, bologna, accords, the, architectural, structural, mechanical, and, electrical, engineering, branches, each, have, well, established, educational, requirements, that, are, usually, fulfilled, by, completion, of, a, university, program, in, canada, a, ceab, accredited, engineer, degree, is, the, minimum, academic, requirement, for, registration, as, a, p, eng, professional, engineer, anywhere, in, canada, and, the, standard, against, which, all, other, engineering, academic, qualifications, are, measured, a, graduate, of, a, non, ceab, accredited, program, must, demonstrate, that, his, or, her, education, is, at, least, equivalent, to, that, of, a, graduate, of, a, ceab, accredited, program, in, vietnam, the, engineer, s, degree, is, called, b, ng, k, s, the, first, degree, after, five, years, of, study, the, ministry, of, education, of, vietnam, has, also, issued, separate, regulations, for, the, naming, of, degrees, not, in, accordance, with, international, regulation, its, multi, disciplinary, engineering, approach, is, what, differentiates, architectural, engineering, from, architecture, the, field, of, the, architect, which, is, an, integrated, separate, and, single, field, of, study, when, compared, to, other, engineering, disciplines, through, training, in, and, appreciation, of, architecture, the, field, seeks, integration, of, building, systems, within, its, overall, building, design, architectural, engineering, includes, the, design, of, building, systems, including, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, plumbing, fire, protection, electrical, lighting, architectural, acoustics, and, structural, systems, in, some, university, programs, students, are, required, to, concentrate, on, one, of, the, systems, in, others, they, can, receive, a, generalist, architectural, or, building, engineering, degree
