the, global, positioning, system, gps, originally, navstar, gps, is, a, satellite, based, radio, navigation, system, owned, by, the, united, states, government, and, operated, by, the, united, states, space, force, it, is, one, of, the, global, navigation, satellite, systems, gnss, that, provide, geolocation, and, time, information, to, a, gps, receiver, anywhere, on, or, near, the, earth, where, there, is, an, unobstructed, line, of, sight, to, four, or, more, gps, satellites, it, does, not, require, the, user, to, transmit, any, data, and, operates, independently, of, any, telephone, or, internet, reception, though, these, technologies, can, enhance, the, usefulness, of, the, gps, positioning, information, it, provides, critical, positioning, capabilities, to, military, civil, and, commercial, users, around, the, world, although, the, united, states, government, created, controls, and, maintains, the, gps, system, it, is, freely, accessible, to, anyone, with, a, gps, receiver, the, gps, project, was, started, by, the, u, s, department, of, defense, in, 1973, the, first, prototype, spacecraft, was, launched, in, 1978, and, the, full, constellation, of, 24, satellites, became, operational, in, 1993, after, korean, air, lines, flight, 007, was, shot, down, when, it, mistakenly, entered, soviet, airspace, president, ronald, reagan, announced, that, the, gps, system, would, be, made, available, for, civilian, use, as, of, september, 16, 1983, however, initially, this, civilian, use, was, limited, to, an, average, accuracy, of, 100, meters, 330, ft, by, use, of, selective, availability, sa, a, deliberate, error, introduced, into, the, gps, data, which, military, receivers, could, correct, for, as, civilian, gps, usage, grew, there, was, increasing, pressure, to, remove, this, error, the, sa, system, was, temporarily, disabled, during, the, gulf, war, as, a, shortage, of, military, gps, units, meant, that, many, us, soldiers, were, using, civilian, gps, units, sent, from, home, in, the, 1990s, differential, gps, systems, from, the, us, coast, guard, federal, aviation, administration, and, similar, agencies, in, other, countries, began, to, broadcast, local, gps, corrections, reducing, the, effect, of, both, sa, degradation, and, atmospheric, effects, that, military, receivers, also, corrected, for, the, us, military, had, also, developed, methods, to, perform, local, gps, jamming, meaning, that, the, ability, to, globally, degrade, the, system, was, no, longer, necessary, as, a, result, president, bill, clinton, signed, a, bill, ordering, that, selective, availability, be, disabled, on, may, 1, 2000, and, in, 2007, the, us, government, announced, that, the, next, generation, of, gps, satellites, would, not, include, the, feature, at, all, advances, in, technology, and, new, demands, on, the, existing, system, have, now, led, to, efforts, to, modernize, the, gps, and, implement, the, next, generation, of, gps, block, iii, satellites, and, next, generation, operational, control, system, ocx, which, was, authorized, by, the, u, s, congress, in, 2000, when, selective, availability, was, discontinued, gps, was, accurate, to, about, 5, meters, 16, ft, gps, receivers, that, use, the, l5, band, have, much, higher, accuracy, of, 30, centimeters, 12, in, while, those, for, high, end, applications, such, as, engineering, and, land, surveying, are, accurate, to, within, 2, cm, 3, 4, in, and, can, even, provide, sub, millimeter, accuracy, with, long, term, measurements, consumer, devices, such, as, smartphones, can, be, accurate, to, 4, 9, m, 16, ft, or, better, when, used, with, assistive, services, like, wi, fi, positioning, as, of, july, 2023, 18, gps, satellites, broadcast, l5, signals, which, are, considered, pre, operational, prior, to, being, broadcast, by, a, full, complement, of, 24, satellites, in, 2027, the, gps, project, was, launched, in, the, united, states, in, 1973, to, overcome, the, limitations, of, previous, navigation, systems, combining, ideas, from, several, predecessors, including, classified, engineering, design, studies, from, the, 1960s, the, u, s, department, of, defense, developed, the, system, which, originally, used, 24, satellites, for, use, by, the, united, states, military, and, became, fully, operational, in, 1993, civilian, use, was, allowed, from, the, 1980s, roger, l, easton, of, the, naval, research, laboratory, ivan, a, getting, of, the, aerospace, corporation, and, bradford, parkinson, of, the, applied, physics, laboratory, are, credited, with, inventing, it, the, work, of, gladys, west, on, the, creation, of, the, mathematical, geodetic, earth, model, is, credited, as, instrumental, in, the, development, of, computational, techniques, for, detecting, satellite, positions, with, the, precision, needed, for, gps, the, design, of, gps, is, based, partly, on, similar, ground, based, radio, navigation, systems, such, as, loran, and, the, decca, navigator, developed, in, the, early, 1940s, in, 1955, friedwardt, winterberg, proposed, a, test, of, general, relativity, detecting, time, slowing, in, a, strong, gravitational, field, using, accurate, atomic, clocks, placed, in, orbit, inside, artificial, satellites, special, and, general, relativity, predicted, that, the, clocks, on, gps, satellites, as, observed, by, those, on, earth, run, 38, microseconds, faster, per, day, than, those, on, the, earth, the, design, of, gps, corrects, for, this, difference, because, without, doing, so, gps, calculated, positions, would, accumulate, errors, of, up, to, 10, kilometers, per, day, 6, mi, d, when, the, soviet, union, launched, its, first, artificial, satellite, sputnik, 1, in, 1957, two, american, physicists, william, guier, and, george, weiffenbach, at, johns, hopkins, university, s, applied, physics, laboratory, apl, decided, to, monitor, its, radio, transmissions, within, hours, they, realized, that, because, of, the, doppler, effect, they, could, pinpoint, where, the, satellite, was, along, its, orbit, the, director, of, the, apl, gave, them, access, to, their, univac, to, do, the, heavy, calculations, required, early, the, next, year, frank, mcclure, the, deputy, director, of, the, apl, asked, guier, and, weiffenbach, to, investigate, the, inverse, problem, pinpointing, the, user, s, location, given, the, satellite, s, at, the, time, the, navy, was, developing, the, submarine, launched, polaris, missile, which, required, them, to, know, the, submarine, s, location, this, led, them, and, apl, to, develop, the, transit, system, in, 1959, arpa, renamed, darpa, in, 1972, also, played, a, role, in, transit, transit, was, first, successfully, tested, in, 1960, it, used, a, constellation, of, five, satellites, and, could, provide, a, navigational, fix, approximately, once, per, hour, in, 1967, the, u, s, navy, developed, the, timation, satellite, which, proved, the, feasibility, of, placing, accurate, clocks, in, space, a, technology, required, for, gps, in, the, 1970s, the, ground, based, omega, navigation, system, based, on, phase, comparison, of, signal, transmission, from, pairs, of, stations, became, the, first, worldwide, radio, navigation, system, limitations, of, these, systems, drove, the, need, for, a, more, universal, navigation, solution, with, greater, accuracy, although, there, were, wide, needs, for, accurate, navigation, in, military, and, civilian, sectors, almost, none, of, those, was, seen, as, justification, for, the, billions, of, dollars, it, would, cost, in, research, development, deployment, and, operation, of, a, constellation, of, navigation, satellites, during, the, cold, war, arms, race, the, nuclear, threat, to, the, existence, of, the, united, states, was, the, one, need, that, did, justify, this, cost, in, the, view, of, the, united, states, congress, this, deterrent, effect, is, why, gps, was, funded, it, is, also, the, reason, for, the, ultra, secrecy, at, that, time, the, nuclear, triad, consisted, of, the, united, states, navy, s, submarine, launched, ballistic, missiles, slbms, along, with, united, states, air, force, usaf, strategic, bombers, and, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbms, considered, vital, to, the, nuclear, deterrence, posture, accurate, determination, of, the, slbm, launch, position, was, a, force, multiplier, precise, navigation, would, enable, united, states, ballistic, missile, submarines, to, get, an, accurate, fix, of, their, positions, before, they, launched, their, slbms, the, usaf, with, two, thirds, of, the, nuclear, triad, also, had, requirements, for, a, more, accurate, and, reliable, navigation, system, the, u, s, navy, and, u, s, air, force, were, developing, their, own, technologies, in, parallel, to, solve, what, was, essentially, the, same, problem, to, increase, the, survivability, of, icbms, there, was, a, proposal, to, use, mobile, launch, platforms, comparable, to, the, soviet, ss, 24, and, ss, 25, and, so, the, need, to, fix, the, launch, position, had, similarity, to, the, slbm, situation, in, 1960, the, air, force, proposed, a, radio, navigation, system, called, mosaic, mobile, system, for, accurate, icbm, control, that, was, essentially, a, 3, d, loran, a, follow, on, study, project, 57, was, performed, in, 1963, and, it, was, in, this, study, that, the, gps, concept, was, born, that, same, year, the, concept, was, pursued, as, project, 621b, which, had, many, of, the, attributes, that, you, now, see, in, gps, and, promised, increased, accuracy, for, air, force, bombers, as, well, as, icbms, updates, from, the, navy, transit, system, were, too, slow, for, the, high, speeds, of, air, force, operation, the, naval, research, laboratory, nrl, continued, making, advances, with, their, timation, time, navigation, satellites, first, launched, in, 1967, second, launched, in, 1969, with, the, third, in, 1974, carrying, the, first, atomic, clock, into, orbit, and, the, fourth, launched, in, 1977, another, important, predecessor, to, gps, came, from, a, different, branch, of, the, united, states, military, in, 1964, the, united, states, army, orbited, its, first, sequential, collation, of, range, secor, satellite, used, for, geodetic, surveying, the, secor, system, included, three, ground, based, transmitters, at, known, locations, that, would, send, signals, to, the, satellite, transponder, in, orbit, a, fourth, ground, based, station, at, an, undetermined, position, could, then, use, those, signals, to, fix, its, location, precisely, the, last, secor, satellite, was, launched, in, 1969, with, these, parallel, developments, in, the, 1960s, it, was, realized, that, a, superior, system, could, be, developed, by, synthesizing, the, best, technologies, from, 621b, transit, timation, and, secor, in, a, multi, service, program, satellite, orbital, position, errors, induced, by, variations, in, the, gravity, field, and, radar, refraction, among, others, had, to, be, resolved, a, team, led, by, harold, l, jury, of, pan, am, aerospace, division, in, florida, from, 1970, to, 1973, used, real, time, data, assimilation, and, recursive, estimation, to, do, so, reducing, systematic, and, residual, errors, to, a, manageable, level, to, permit, accurate, navigation, during, labor, day, weekend, in, 1973, a, meeting, of, about, twelve, military, officers, at, the, pentagon, discussed, the, creation, of, a, defense, navigation, satellite, system, dnss, it, was, at, this, meeting, that, the, real, synthesis, that, became, gps, was, created, later, that, year, the, dnss, program, was, named, navstar, navstar, is, often, erroneously, considered, an, acronym, for, navigation, system, using, timing, and, ranging, but, was, never, considered, as, such, by, the, gps, joint, program, office, trw, may, have, once, advocated, for, a, different, navigational, system, that, used, that, acronym, with, the, individual, satellites, being, associated, with, the, name, navstar, as, with, the, predecessors, transit, and, timation, a, more, fully, encompassing, name, was, used, to, identify, the, constellation, of, navstar, satellites, navstar, gps, ten, block, i, prototype, satellites, were, launched, between, 1978, and, 1985, an, additional, unit, was, destroyed, in, a, launch, failure, the, effect, of, the, ionosphere, on, radio, transmission, was, investigated, in, a, geophysics, laboratory, of, air, force, cambridge, research, laboratory, renamed, to, air, force, geophysical, research, lab, afgrl, in, 1974, afgrl, developed, the, klobuchar, model, for, computing, ionospheric, corrections, to, gps, location, of, note, is, work, done, by, australian, space, scientist, elizabeth, essex, cohen, at, afgrl, in, 1974, she, was, concerned, with, the, curving, of, the, paths, of, radio, waves, atmospheric, refraction, traversing, the, ionosphere, from, navstar, satellites, after, korean, air, lines, flight, 007, a, boeing, 747, carrying, 269, people, was, shot, down, by, a, soviet, interceptor, aircraft, after, straying, in, prohibited, airspace, because, of, navigational, errors, in, the, vicinity, of, sakhalin, and, moneron, islands, president, ronald, reagan, issued, a, directive, making, gps, freely, available, for, civilian, use, once, it, was, sufficiently, developed, as, a, common, good, the, first, block, ii, satellite, was, launched, on, february, 14, 1989, and, the, 24th, satellite, was, launched, in, 1994, the, gps, program, cost, at, this, point, not, including, the, cost, of, the, user, equipment, but, including, the, costs, of, the, satellite, launches, has, been, estimated, at, us, 5, billion, equivalent, to, 10, billion, in, 2023, initially, the, highest, quality, signal, was, reserved, for, military, use, and, the, signal, available, for, civilian, use, was, intentionally, degraded, in, a, policy, known, as, selective, availability, this, changed, on, may, 1, 2000, with, president, bill, clinton, signing, a, policy, directive, to, turn, off, selective, availability, to, provide, the, same, accuracy, to, civilians, that, was, afforded, to, the, military, the, directive, was, proposed, by, the, u, s, secretary, of, defense, william, perry, in, view, of, the, widespread, growth, of, differential, gps, services, by, private, industry, to, improve, civilian, accuracy, moreover, the, u, s, military, was, developing, technologies, to, deny, gps, service, to, potential, adversaries, on, a, regional, basis, selective, availability, was, removed, from, the, gps, architecture, beginning, with, gps, iii, since, its, deployment, the, u, s, has, implemented, several, improvements, to, the, gps, service, including, new, signals, for, civil, use, and, increased, accuracy, and, integrity, for, all, users, all, the, while, maintaining, compatibility, with, existing, gps, equipment, modernization, of, the, satellite, system, has, been, an, ongoing, initiative, by, the, u, s, department, of, defense, through, a, series, of, satellite, acquisitions, to, meet, the, growing, needs, of, the, military, civilians, and, the, commercial, market, as, of, early, 2015, high, quality, standard, positioning, service, sps, gps, receivers, provided, horizontal, accuracy, of, better, than, 3, 5, meters, 11, ft, although, many, factors, such, as, receiver, and, antenna, quality, and, atmospheric, issues, can, affect, this, accuracy, gps, is, owned, and, operated, by, the, united, states, government, as, a, national, resource, the, department, of, defense, is, the, steward, of, gps, the, interagency, gps, executive, board, igeb, oversaw, gps, policy, matters, from, 1996, to, 2004, after, that, the, national, space, based, positioning, navigation, and, timing, executive, committee, was, established, by, presidential, directive, in, 2004, to, advise, and, coordinate, federal, departments, and, agencies, on, matters, concerning, the, gps, and, related, systems, the, executive, committee, is, chaired, jointly, by, the, deputy, secretaries, of, defense, and, transportation, its, membership, includes, equivalent, level, officials, from, the, departments, of, state, commerce, and, homeland, security, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, and, nasa, components, of, the, executive, office, of, the, president, participate, as, observers, to, the, executive, committee, and, the, fcc, chairman, participates, as, a, liaison, the, u, s, department, of, defense, is, required, by, law, to, maintain, a, standard, positioning, service, as, defined, in, the, federal, radio, navigation, plan, and, the, standard, positioning, service, signal, specification, that, will, be, available, on, a, continuous, worldwide, basis, and, develop, measures, to, prevent, hostile, use, of, gps, and, its, augmentations, without, unduly, disrupting, or, degrading, civilian, uses, usa, 203, from, block, iir, m, is, unhealthy, for, a, more, complete, list, see, list, of, gps, satellites, on, february, 10, 1993, the, national, aeronautic, association, selected, the, gps, team, as, winners, of, the, 1992, robert, j, collier, trophy, the, us, s, most, prestigious, aviation, award, this, team, combines, researchers, from, the, naval, research, laboratory, the, usaf, the, aerospace, corporation, rockwell, international, corporation, and, ibm, federal, systems, company, the, citation, honors, them, for, the, most, significant, development, for, safe, and, efficient, navigation, and, surveillance, of, air, and, spacecraft, since, the, introduction, of, radio, navigation, 50, years, ago, two, gps, developers, received, the, national, academy, of, engineering, charles, stark, draper, prize, for, 2003, gps, developer, roger, l, easton, received, the, national, medal, of, technology, on, february, 13, 2006, francis, x, kane, col, usaf, ret, was, inducted, into, the, u, s, air, force, space, and, missile, pioneers, hall, of, fame, at, lackland, a, f, b, san, antonio, texas, march, 2, 2010, for, his, role, in, space, technology, development, and, the, engineering, design, concept, of, gps, conducted, as, part, of, project, 621b, in, 1998, gps, technology, was, inducted, into, the, space, foundation, space, technology, hall, of, fame, on, october, 4, 2011, the, international, astronautical, federation, iaf, awarded, the, global, positioning, system, gps, its, 60th, anniversary, award, nominated, by, iaf, member, the, american, institute, for, aeronautics, and, astronautics, aiaa, the, iaf, honors, and, awards, committee, recognized, the, uniqueness, of, the, gps, program, and, the, exemplary, role, it, has, played, in, building, international, collaboration, for, the, benefit, of, humanity, on, december, 6, 2018, gladys, west, was, inducted, into, the, air, force, space, and, missile, pioneers, hall, of, fame, in, recognition, of, her, work, on, an, extremely, accurate, geodetic, earth, model, which, was, ultimately, used, to, determine, the, orbit, of, the, gps, constellation, on, february, 12, 2019, four, founding, members, of, the, project, were, awarded, the, queen, elizabeth, prize, for, engineering, with, the, chair, of, the, awarding, board, stating, engineering, is, the, foundation, of, civilisation, there, is, no, other, foundation, it, makes, things, happen, and, that, s, exactly, what, today, s, laureates, have, done, they, ve, made, things, happen, they, ve, re, written, in, a, major, way, the, infrastructure, of, our, world, the, gps, satellites, carry, very, stable, atomic, clocks, that, are, synchronized, with, one, another, and, with, the, reference, atomic, clocks, at, the, ground, control, stations, any, drift, of, the, clocks, aboard, the, satellites, from, the, reference, time, maintained, on, the, ground, stations, is, corrected, regularly, since, the, speed, of, radio, waves, speed, of, light, is, constant, and, independent, of, the, satellite, speed, the, time, delay, between, when, the, satellite, transmits, a, signal, and, the, ground, station, receives, it, is, proportional, to, the, distance, from, the, satellite, to, the, ground, station, with, the, distance, information, collected, from, multiple, ground, stations, the, location, coordinates, of, any, satellite, at, any, time, can, be, calculated, with, great, precision, each, gps, satellite, carries, an, accurate, record, of, its, own, position, and, time, and, broadcasts, that, data, continuously, based, on, data, received, from, multiple, gps, satellites, an, end, user, s, gps, receiver, can, calculate, its, own, four, dimensional, position, in, spacetime, however, at, a, minimum, four, satellites, must, be, in, view, of, the, receiver, for, it, to, compute, four, unknown, quantities, three, position, coordinates, and, the, deviation, of, its, own, clock, from, satellite, time, each, gps, satellite, continually, broadcasts, a, signal, carrier, wave, with, modulation, that, includes, conceptually, the, receiver, measures, the, toas, according, to, its, own, clock, of, four, satellite, signals, from, the, toas, and, the, tots, the, receiver, forms, four, time, of, flight, tof, values, which, are, given, the, speed, of, light, approximately, equivalent, to, receiver, satellite, ranges, plus, time, difference, between, the, receiver, and, gps, satellites, multiplied, by, speed, of, light, which, are, called, pseudo, ranges, the, receiver, then, computes, its, three, dimensional, position, and, clock, deviation, from, the, four, tofs, in, practice, the, receiver, position, in, three, dimensional, cartesian, coordinates, with, origin, at, the, earth, s, center, and, the, offset, of, the, receiver, clock, relative, to, the, gps, time, are, computed, simultaneously, using, the, navigation, equations, to, process, the, tofs, the, receiver, s, earth, centered, solution, location, is, usually, converted, to, latitude, longitude, and, height, relative, to, an, ellipsoidal, earth, model, the, height, may, then, be, further, converted, to, height, relative, to, the, geoid, which, is, essentially, mean, sea, level, these, coordinates, may, be, displayed, such, as, on, a, moving, map, display, or, recorded, or, used, by, some, other, system, such, as, a, vehicle, guidance, system, although, usually, not, formed, explicitly, in, the, receiver, processing, the, conceptual, time, differences, of, arrival, tdoas, define, the, measurement, geometry, each, tdoa, corresponds, to, a, hyperboloid, of, revolution, see, multilateration, the, line, connecting, the, two, satellites, involved, and, its, extensions, forms, the, axis, of, the, hyperboloid, the, receiver, is, located, at, the, point, where, three, hyperboloids, intersect, it, is, sometimes, incorrectly, said, that, the, user, location, is, at, the, intersection, of, three, spheres, while, simpler, to, visualize, this, is, the, case, only, if, the, receiver, has, a, clock, synchronized, with, the, satellite, clocks, i, e, the, receiver, measures, true, ranges, to, the, satellites, rather, than, range, differences, there, are, marked, performance, benefits, to, the, user, carrying, a, clock, synchronized, with, the, satellites, foremost, is, that, only, three, satellites, are, needed, to, compute, a, position, solution, if, it, were, an, essential, part, of, the, gps, concept, that, all, users, needed, to, carry, a, synchronized, clock, a, smaller, number, of, satellites, could, be, deployed, but, the, cost, and, complexity, of, the, user, equipment, would, increase, the, description, above, is, representative, of, a, receiver, start, up, situation, most, receivers, have, a, track, algorithm, sometimes, called, a, tracker, that, combines, sets, of, satellite, measurements, collected, at, different, times, in, effect, taking, advantage, of, the, fact, that, successive, receiver, positions, are, usually, close, to, each, other, after, a, set, of, measurements, are, processed, the, tracker, predicts, the, receiver, location, corresponding, to, the, next, set, of, satellite, measurements, when, the, new, measurements, are, collected, the, receiver, uses, a, weighting, scheme, to, combine, the, new, measurements, with, the, tracker, prediction, in, general, a, tracker, can, a, improve, receiver, position, and, time, accuracy, b, reject, bad, measurements, and, c, estimate, receiver, speed, and, direction, the, disadvantage, of, a, tracker, is, that, changes, in, speed, or, direction, can, be, computed, only, with, a, delay, and, that, derived, direction, becomes, inaccurate, when, the, distance, traveled, between, two, position, measurements, drops, below, or, near, the, random, error, of, position, measurement, gps, units, can, use, measurements, of, the, doppler, shift, of, the, signals, received, to, compute, velocity, accurately, more, advanced, navigation, systems, use, additional, sensors, like, a, compass, or, an, inertial, navigation, system, to, complement, gps, gps, requires, four, or, more, satellites, to, be, visible, for, accurate, navigation, the, solution, of, the, navigation, equations, gives, the, position, of, the, receiver, along, with, the, difference, between, the, time, kept, by, the, receiver, s, on, board, clock, and, the, true, time, of, day, thereby, eliminating, the, need, for, a, more, precise, and, possibly, impractical, receiver, based, clock, applications, for, gps, such, as, time, transfer, traffic, signal, timing, and, synchronization, of, cell, phone, base, stations, make, use, of, this, cheap, and, highly, accurate, timing, some, gps, applications, use, this, time, for, display, or, other, than, for, the, basic, position, calculations, do, not, use, it, at, all, although, four, satellites, are, required, for, normal, operation, fewer, apply, in, special, cases, if, one, variable, is, already, known, a, receiver, can, determine, its, position, using, only, three, satellites, for, example, a, ship, on, the, open, ocean, usually, has, a, known, elevation, close, to, 0m, and, the, elevation, of, an, aircraft, may, be, known, some, gps, receivers, may, use, additional, clues, or, assumptions, such, as, reusing, the, last, known, altitude, dead, reckoning, inertial, navigation, or, including, information, from, the, vehicle, computer, to, give, a, possibly, degraded, position, when, fewer, than, four, satellites, are, visible, the, current, gps, consists, of, three, major, segments, these, are, the, space, segment, a, control, segment, and, a, user, segment, the, u, s, space, force, develops, maintains, and, operates, the, space, and, control, segments, gps, satellites, broadcast, signals, from, space, and, each, gps, receiver, uses, these, signals, to, calculate, its, three, dimensional, location, latitude, longitude, and, altitude, and, the, current, time, the, space, segment, ss, is, composed, of, 24, to, 32, satellites, or, space, vehicles, sv, in, medium, earth, orbit, and, also, includes, the, payload, adapters, to, the, boosters, required, to, launch, them, into, orbit, the, gps, design, originally, called, for, 24, svs, eight, each, in, three, approximately, circular, orbits, but, this, was, modified, to, six, orbital, planes, with, four, satellites, each, the, six, orbit, planes, have, approximately, 55, inclination, tilt, relative, to, the, earth, s, equator, and, are, separated, by, 60, right, ascension, of, the, ascending, node, angle, along, the, equator, from, a, reference, point, to, the, orbit, s, intersection, the, orbital, period, is, one, half, of, a, sidereal, day, i, e, 11, hours, and, 58, minutes, so, that, the, satellites, pass, over, the, same, locations, or, almost, the, same, locations, every, day, the, orbits, are, arranged, so, that, at, least, six, satellites, are, always, within, line, of, sight, from, everywhere, on, the, earth, s, surface, see, animation, at, right, the, result, of, this, objective, is, that, the, four, satellites, are, not, evenly, spaced, 90, apart, within, each, orbit, in, general, terms, the, angular, difference, between, satellites, in, each, orbit, is, 30, 105, 120, and, 105, apart, which, sum, to, 360, orbiting, at, an, altitude, of, approximately, 20, 200, km, 12, 600, mi, orbital, radius, of, approximately, 26, 600, km, 16, 500, mi, each, sv, makes, two, complete, orbits, each, sidereal, day, repeating, the, same, ground, track, each, day, this, was, very, helpful, during, development, because, even, with, only, four, satellites, correct, alignment, means, all, four, are, visible, from, one, spot, for, a, few, hours, each, day, for, military, operations, the, ground, track, repeat, can, be, used, to, ensure, good, coverage, in, combat, zones, as, of, february, 2019, there, are, 31, satellites, in, the, gps, constellation, 27, of, which, are, in, use, at, a, given, time, with, the, rest, allocated, as, stand, bys, a, 32nd, was, launched, in, 2018, but, as, of, july, 2019, is, still, in, evaluation, more, decommissioned, satellites, are, in, orbit, and, available, as, spares, the, additional, satellites, improve, the, precision, of, gps, receiver, calculations, by, providing, redundant, measurements, with, the, increased, number, of, satellites, the, constellation, was, changed, to, a, nonuniform, arrangement, such, an, arrangement, was, shown, to, improve, accuracy, but, also, improves, reliability, and, availability, of, the, system, relative, to, a, uniform, system, when, multiple, satellites, fail, with, the, expanded, constellation, nine, satellites, are, usually, visible, at, any, time, from, any, point, on, the, earth, with, a, clear, horizon, ensuring, considerable, redundancy, over, the, minimum, four, satellites, needed, for, a, position, the, control, segment, cs, is, composed, of, the, mcs, can, also, access, satellite, control, network, scn, ground, antennas, for, additional, command, and, control, capability, and, nga, national, geospatial, intelligence, agency, monitor, stations, the, flight, paths, of, the, satellites, are, tracked, by, dedicated, u, s, space, force, monitoring, stations, in, hawaii, kwajalein, atoll, ascension, island, diego, garcia, colorado, springs, colorado, and, cape, canaveral, along, with, shared, nga, monitor, stations, operated, in, england, argentina, ecuador, bahrain, australia, and, washington, dc, the, tracking, information, is, sent, to, the, mcs, at, schriever, space, force, base, 25, km, 16, mi, ese, of, colorado, springs, which, is, operated, by, the, 2nd, space, operations, squadron, 2, sops, of, the, u, s, space, force, then, 2, sops, contacts, each, gps, satellite, regularly, with, a, navigational, update, using, dedicated, or, shared, afscn, ground, antennas, gps, dedicated, ground, antennas, are, located, at, kwajalein, ascension, island, diego, garcia, and, cape, canaveral, these, updates, synchronize, the, atomic, clocks, on, board, the, satellites, to, within, a, few, nanoseconds, of, each, other, and, adjust, the, ephemeris, of, each, satellite, s, internal, orbital, model, the, updates, are, created, by, a, kalman, filter, that, uses, inputs, from, the, ground, monitoring, stations, space, weather, information, and, various, other, inputs, when, a, satellite, s, orbit, is, being, adjusted, the, satellite, is, marked, unhealthy, so, receivers, do, not, use, it, after, the, maneuver, engineers, track, the, new, orbit, from, the, ground, upload, the, new, ephemeris, and, mark, the, satellite, healthy, again, the, operation, control, segment, ocs, currently, serves, as, the, control, segment, of, record, it, provides, the, operational, capability, that, supports, gps, users, and, keeps, the, gps, operational, and, performing, within, specification, ocs, successfully, replaced, the, legacy, 1970s, era, mainframe, computer, at, schriever, air, force, base, in, september, 2007, after, installation, the, system, helped, enable, upgrades, and, provide, a, foundation, for, a, new, security, architecture, that, supported, u, s, armed, forces, ocs, will, continue, to, be, the, ground, control, system, of, record, until, the, new, segment, next, generation, gps, operation, control, system, ocx, is, fully, developed, and, functional, the, us, department, of, defense, has, claimed, that, the, new, capabilities, provided, by, ocx, will, be, the, cornerstone, for, revolutionizing, gps, s, mission, capabilities, enabling, u, s, space, force, to, greatly, enhance, gps, operational, services, to, u, s, combat, forces, civil, partners, and, myriad, domestic, and, international, users, the, gps, ocx, program, also, will, reduce, cost, schedule, and, technical, risk, it, is, designed, to, provide, 50, sustainment, cost, savings, through, efficient, software, architecture, and, performance, based, logistics, in, addition, gps, ocx, is, expected, to, cost, millions, less, than, the, cost, to, upgrade, ocs, while, providing, four, times, the, capability, the, gps, ocx, program, represents, a, critical, part, of, gps, modernization, and, provides, significant, information, assurance, improvements, over, the, current, gps, ocs, program, on, september, 14, 2011, the, u, s, air, force, announced, the, completion, of, gps, ocx, preliminary, design, review, and, confirmed, that, the, ocx, program, is, ready, for, the, next, phase, of, development, the, gps, ocx, program, missed, major, milestones, and, pushed, its, launch, into, 2021, 5, years, past, the, original, deadline, according, to, the, government, accounting, office, in, 2019, the, 2021, deadline, looked, shaky, the, project, remained, delayed, in, 2023, and, was, as, of, june, 2023, 73, over, its, original, estimated, budget, in, late, 2023, frank, calvelli, the, assistant, secretary, of, the, air, force, for, space, acquisitions, and, integration, stated, that, the, project, was, estimated, to, go, live, some, time, during, the, summer, of, 2024, the, user, segment, us, is, composed, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, u, s, and, allied, military, users, of, the, secure, gps, precise, positioning, service, and, tens, of, millions, of, civil, commercial, and, scientific, users, of, the, standard, positioning, service, in, general, gps, receivers, are, composed, of, an, antenna, tuned, to, the, frequencies, transmitted, by, the, satellites, receiver, processors, and, a, highly, stable, clock, often, a, crystal, oscillator, they, may, also, include, a, display, for, providing, location, and, speed, information, to, the, user, gps, receivers, may, include, an, input, for, differential, corrections, using, the, rtcm, sc, 104, format, this, is, typically, in, the, form, of, an, rs, 232, port, at, 4, 800, bit, s, speed, data, is, actually, sent, at, a, much, lower, rate, which, limits, the, accuracy, of, the, signal, sent, using, rtcm, receivers, with, internal, dgps, receivers, can, outperform, those, using, external, rtcm, data, as, of, 2006, even, low, cost, units, commonly, include, wide, area, augmentation, system, waas, receivers, many, gps, receivers, can, relay, position, data, to, a, pc, or, other, device, using, the, nmea, 0183, protocol, although, this, protocol, is, officially, defined, by, the, national, marine, electronics, association, nmea, references, to, this, protocol, have, been, compiled, from, public, records, allowing, open, source, tools, like, gpsd, to, read, the, protocol, without, violating, intellectual, property, laws, other, proprietary, protocols, exist, as, well, such, as, the, sirf, and, mtk, protocols, receivers, can, interface, with, other, devices, using, methods, including, a, serial, connection, usb, or, bluetooth, while, originally, a, military, project, gps, is, considered, a, dual, use, technology, meaning, it, has, significant, civilian, applications, as, well, gps, has, become, a, widely, deployed, and, useful, tool, for, commerce, scientific, uses, tracking, and, surveillance, gps, s, accurate, time, facilitates, everyday, activities, such, as, banking, mobile, phone, operations, and, even, the, control, of, power, grids, by, allowing, well, synchronized, hand, off, switching, many, civilian, applications, use, one, or, more, of, gps, s, three, basic, components, absolute, location, relative, movement, and, time, transfer, the, u, s, government, controls, the, export, of, some, civilian, receivers, all, gps, receivers, capable, of, functioning, above, 60, 000, ft, 18, km, above, sea, level, and, 1, 000, kn, 500, m, s, 2, 000, km, h, 1, 000, mph, or, designed, or, modified, for, use, with, unmanned, missiles, and, aircraft, are, classified, as, munitions, weapons, which, means, they, require, state, department, export, licenses, this, rule, applies, even, to, otherwise, purely, civilian, units, that, only, receive, the, l1, frequency, and, the, c, a, coarse, acquisition, code, disabling, operation, above, these, limits, exempts, the, receiver, from, classification, as, a, munition, vendor, interpretations, differ, the, rule, refers, to, operation, at, both, the, target, altitude, and, speed, but, some, receivers, stop, operating, even, when, stationary, this, has, caused, problems, with, some, amateur, radio, balloon, launches, that, regularly, reach, 30, km, 100, 000, feet, these, limits, only, apply, to, units, or, components, exported, from, the, united, states, a, growing, trade, in, various, components, exists, including, gps, units, from, other, countries, these, are, expressly, sold, as, itar, free, as, of, 2009, military, gps, applications, include, gps, type, navigation, was, first, used, in, war, in, the, 1991, persian, gulf, war, before, gps, was, fully, developed, in, 1995, to, assist, coalition, forces, to, navigate, and, perform, maneuvers, in, the, war, the, war, also, demonstrated, the, vulnerability, of, gps, to, being, jammed, when, iraqi, forces, installed, jamming, devices, on, likely, targets, that, emitted, radio, noise, disrupting, reception, of, the, weak, gps, signal, gps, s, vulnerability, to, jamming, is, a, threat, that, continues, to, grow, as, jamming, equipment, and, experience, grows, gps, signals, have, been, reported, to, have, been, jammed, many, times, over, the, years, for, military, purposes, russia, seems, to, have, several, objectives, for, this, approach, such, as, intimidating, neighbors, while, undermining, confidence, in, their, reliance, on, american, systems, promoting, their, glonass, alternative, disrupting, western, military, exercises, and, protecting, assets, from, drones, china, uses, jamming, to, discourage, us, surveillance, aircraft, near, the, contested, spratly, islands, north, korea, has, mounted, several, major, jamming, operations, near, its, border, with, south, korea, and, offshore, disrupting, flights, shipping, and, fishing, operations, iranian, armed, forces, disrupted, the, civilian, airliner, plane, flight, ps752, s, gps, when, it, shot, down, the, aircraft, in, the, russo, ukrainian, war, gps, guided, munitions, provided, to, ukraine, by, nato, countries, experienced, significant, failure, rates, as, a, result, of, russian, electronic, warfare, excalibur, artillery, shells, efficiency, rate, hitting, targets, dropped, from, 70, to, 6, as, russia, adapted, its, electronic, warfare, activities, while, most, clocks, derive, their, time, from, coordinated, universal, time, utc, the, atomic, clocks, on, the, satellites, are, set, to, gps, time, the, difference, is, that, gps, time, is, not, corrected, to, match, the, rotation, of, the, earth, so, it, does, not, contain, new, leap, seconds, or, other, corrections, that, are, periodically, added, to, utc, gps, time, was, set, to, match, utc, in, 1980, but, has, since, diverged, the, lack, of, corrections, means, that, gps, time, remains, at, a, constant, offset, with, international, atomic, time, tai, tai, gps, 19, seconds, periodic, corrections, are, performed, to, the, on, board, clocks, to, keep, them, synchronized, with, ground, clocks, section, 1, 2, 2, the, gps, navigation, message, includes, the, difference, between, gps, time, and, utc, as, of, january, 2017, gps, time, is, 18, seconds, ahead, of, utc, because, of, the, leap, second, added, to, utc, on, december, 31, 2016, receivers, subtract, this, offset, from, gps, time, to, calculate, utc, and, specific, time, zone, values, new, gps, units, may, not, show, the, correct, utc, time, until, after, receiving, the, utc, offset, message, the, gps, utc, offset, field, can, accommodate, 255, leap, seconds, eight, bits, gps, time, is, theoretically, accurate, to, about, 14, nanoseconds, due, to, the, clock, drift, relative, to, international, atomic, time, that, the, atomic, clocks, in, gps, transmitters, experience, most, receivers, lose, some, accuracy, in, their, interpretation, of, the, signals, and, are, only, accurate, to, about, 100, nanoseconds, the, gps, implements, two, major, corrections, to, its, time, signals, for, relativistic, effects, one, for, relative, velocity, of, satellite, and, receiver, using, the, special, theory, of, relativity, and, one, for, the, difference, in, gravitational, potential, between, satellite, and, receiver, using, general, relativity, the, acceleration, of, the, satellite, could, also, be, computed, independently, as, a, correction, depending, on, purpose, but, normally, the, effect, is, already, dealt, with, in, the, first, two, corrections, as, opposed, to, the, year, month, and, day, format, of, the, gregorian, calendar, the, gps, date, is, expressed, as, a, week, number, and, a, seconds, into, week, number, the, week, number, is, transmitted, as, a, ten, bit, field, in, the, c, a, and, p, y, navigation, messages, and, so, it, becomes, zero, again, every, 1, 024, weeks, 19, 6, years, gps, week, zero, started, at, 00, 00, 00, utc, 00, 00, 19, tai, on, january, 6, 1980, and, the, week, number, became, zero, again, for, the, first, time, at, 23, 59, 47, utc, on, august, 21, 1999, 00, 00, 19, tai, on, august, 22, 1999, it, happened, the, second, time, at, 23, 59, 42, utc, on, april, 6, 2019, to, determine, the, current, gregorian, date, a, gps, receiver, must, be, provided, with, the, approximate, date, to, within, 3, 584, days, to, correctly, translate, the, gps, date, signal, to, address, this, concern, in, the, future, the, modernized, gps, civil, navigation, cnav, message, will, use, a, 13, bit, field, that, only, repeats, every, 8, 192, weeks, 157, years, thus, lasting, until, 2137, 157, years, after, gps, week, zero, the, navigational, signals, transmitted, by, gps, satellites, encode, a, variety, of, information, including, satellite, positions, the, state, of, the, internal, clocks, and, the, health, of, the, network, these, signals, are, transmitted, on, two, separate, carrier, frequencies, that, are, common, to, all, satellites, in, the, network, two, different, encodings, are, used, a, public, encoding, that, enables, lower, resolution, navigation, and, an, encrypted, encoding, used, by, the, u, s, military, each, gps, satellite, continuously, broadcasts, a, navigation, message, on, l1, c, a, and, p, y, and, l2, p, y, frequencies, at, a, rate, of, 50, bits, per, second, see, bitrate, each, complete, message, takes, 750, seconds, 12, 1, 2, minutes, to, complete, the, message, structure, has, a, basic, format, of, a, 1500, bit, long, frame, made, up, of, five, subframes, each, subframe, being, 300, bits, 6, seconds, long, subframes, 4, and, 5, are, subcommutated, 25, times, each, so, that, a, complete, data, message, requires, the, transmission, of, 25, full, frames, each, subframe, consists, of, ten, words, each, 30, bits, long, thus, with, 300, bits, in, a, subframe, times, 5, subframes, in, a, frame, times, 25, frames, in, a, message, each, message, is, 37, 500, bits, long, at, a, transmission, rate, of, 50, bit, s, this, gives, 750, seconds, to, transmit, an, entire, almanac, message, gps, each, 30, second, frame, begins, precisely, on, the, minute, or, half, minute, as, indicated, by, the, atomic, clock, on, each, satellite, the, first, subframe, of, each, frame, encodes, the, week, number, and, the, time, within, the, week, as, well, as, the, data, about, the, health, of, the, satellite, the, second, and, the, third, subframes, contain, the, ephemeris, the, precise, orbit, for, the, satellite, the, fourth, and, fifth, subframes, contain, the, almanac, which, contains, coarse, orbit, and, status, information, for, up, to, 32, satellites, in, the, constellation, as, well, as, data, related, to, error, correction, thus, to, obtain, an, accurate, satellite, location, from, this, transmitted, message, the, receiver, must, demodulate, the, message, from, each, satellite, it, includes, in, its, solution, for, 18, to, 30, seconds, to, collect, all, transmitted, almanacs, the, receiver, must, demodulate, the, message, for, 732, to, 750, seconds, or, 12, 1, 2, minutes, all, satellites, broadcast, at, the, same, frequencies, encoding, signals, using, unique, code, division, multiple, access, cdma, so, receivers, can, distinguish, individual, satellites, from, each, other, the, system, uses, two, distinct, cdma, encoding, types, the, coarse, acquisition, c, a, code, which, is, accessible, by, the, general, public, and, the, precise, p, y, code, which, is, encrypted, so, that, only, the, u, s, military, and, other, nato, nations, who, have, been, given, access, to, the, encryption, code, can, access, it, the, ephemeris, is, updated, every, 2, hours, and, is, sufficiently, stable, for, 4, hours, with, provisions, for, updates, every, 6, hours, or, longer, in, non, nominal, conditions, the, almanac, is, updated, typically, every, 24, hours, additionally, data, for, a, few, weeks, following, is, uploaded, in, case, of, transmission, updates, that, delay, data, upload, all, satellites, broadcast, at, the, same, two, frequencies, 1, 57542, ghz, l1, signal, and, 1, 2276, ghz, l2, signal, the, satellite, network, uses, a, cdma, spread, spectrum, technique, 607, where, the, low, bitrate, message, data, is, encoded, with, a, high, rate, pseudo, random, prn, sequence, that, is, different, for, each, satellite, the, receiver, must, be, aware, of, the, prn, codes, for, each, satellite, to, reconstruct, the, actual, message, data, the, c, a, code, for, civilian, use, transmits, data, at, 1, 023, million, chips, per, second, whereas, the, p, code, for, u, s, military, use, transmits, at, 10, 23, million, chips, per, second, the, actual, internal, reference, of, the, satellites, is, 10, 22999999543, mhz, to, compensate, for, relativistic, effects, that, make, observers, on, the, earth, perceive, a, different, time, reference, with, respect, to, the, transmitters, in, orbit, the, l1, carrier, is, modulated, by, both, the, c, a, and, p, codes, while, the, l2, carrier, is, only, modulated, by, the, p, code, the, p, code, can, be, encrypted, as, a, so, called, p, y, code, that, is, only, available, to, military, equipment, with, a, proper, decryption, key, both, the, c, a, and, p, y, codes, impart, the, precise, time, of, day, to, the, user, the, l3, signal, at, a, frequency, of, 1, 38105, ghz, is, used, to, transmit, data, from, the, satellites, to, ground, stations, this, data, is, used, by, the, united, states, nuclear, detonation, nudet, detection, system, usnds, to, detect, locate, and, report, nuclear, detonations, nudets, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, near, space, one, usage, is, the, enforcement, of, nuclear, test, ban, treaties, the, l4, band, at, 1, 379913, ghz, is, being, studied, for, additional, ionospheric, correction, 607, the, l5, frequency, band, at, 1, 17645, ghz, was, added, in, the, process, of, gps, modernization, this, frequency, falls, into, an, internationally, protected, range, for, aeronautical, navigation, promising, little, or, no, interference, under, all, circumstances, the, first, block, iif, satellite, that, provides, this, signal, was, launched, in, may, 2010, on, february, 5, 2016, the, 12th, and, final, block, iif, satellite, was, launched, the, l5, consists, of, two, carrier, components, that, are, in, phase, quadrature, with, each, other, each, carrier, component, is, bi, phase, shift, key, bpsk, modulated, by, a, separate, bit, train, l5, the, third, civil, gps, signal, will, eventually, support, safety, of, life, applications, for, aviation, and, provide, improved, availability, and, accuracy, in, 2011, a, conditional, waiver, was, granted, to, lightsquared, to, operate, a, terrestrial, broadband, service, near, the, l1, band, although, lightsquared, had, applied, for, a, license, to, operate, in, the, 1525, to, 1559, band, as, early, as, 2003, and, it, was, put, out, for, public, comment, the, fcc, asked, lightsquared, to, form, a, study, group, with, the, gps, community, to, test, gps, receivers, and, identify, issues, that, might, arise, due, to, the, larger, signal, power, from, the, lightsquared, terrestrial, network, the, gps, community, had, not, objected, to, the, lightsquared, formerly, msv, and, skyterra, applications, until, november, 2010, when, lightsquared, applied, for, a, modification, to, its, ancillary, terrestrial, component, atc, authorization, this, filing, sat, mod, 20101118, 00239, amounted, to, a, request, to, run, several, orders, of, magnitude, more, power, in, the, same, frequency, band, for, terrestrial, base, stations, essentially, repurposing, what, was, supposed, to, be, a, quiet, neighborhood, for, signals, from, space, as, the, equivalent, of, a, cellular, network, testing, in, the, first, half, of, 2011, has, demonstrated, that, the, impact, of, the, lower, 10, mhz, of, spectrum, is, minimal, to, gps, devices, less, than, 1, of, the, total, gps, devices, are, affected, the, upper, 10, mhz, intended, for, use, by, lightsquared, may, have, some, impact, on, gps, devices, there, is, some, concern, that, this, may, seriously, degrade, the, gps, signal, for, many, consumer, uses, aviation, week, magazine, reports, that, the, latest, testing, june, 2011, confirms, significant, jamming, of, gps, by, lightsquared, s, system, because, all, of, the, satellite, signals, are, modulated, onto, the, same, l1, carrier, frequency, the, signals, must, be, separated, after, demodulation, this, is, done, by, assigning, each, satellite, a, unique, binary, sequence, known, as, a, gold, code, the, signals, are, decoded, after, demodulation, using, addition, of, the, gold, codes, corresponding, to, the, satellites, monitored, by, the, receiver, if, the, almanac, information, has, previously, been, acquired, the, receiver, picks, the, satellites, to, listen, for, by, their, prns, unique, numbers, in, the, range, 1, through, 32, if, the, almanac, information, is, not, in, memory, the, receiver, enters, a, search, mode, until, a, lock, is, obtained, on, one, of, the, satellites, to, obtain, a, lock, it, is, necessary, that, there, be, an, unobstructed, line, of, sight, from, the, receiver, to, the, satellite, the, receiver, can, then, acquire, the, almanac, and, determine, the, satellites, it, should, listen, for, as, it, detects, each, satellite, s, signal, it, identifies, it, by, its, distinct, c, a, code, pattern, there, can, be, a, delay, of, up, to, 30, seconds, before, the, first, estimate, of, position, because, of, the, need, to, read, the, ephemeris, data, processing, of, the, navigation, message, enables, the, determination, of, the, time, of, transmission, and, the, satellite, position, at, this, time, for, more, information, see, demodulation, and, decoding, advanced, the, receiver, uses, messages, received, from, satellites, to, determine, the, satellite, positions, and, time, sent, the, x, y, and, z, components, of, satellite, position, and, the, time, sent, s, are, designated, as, where, the, subscript, i, denotes, the, satellite, and, has, the, value, 1, 2, n, where, n, 4, when, the, time, of, message, reception, indicated, by, the, on, board, receiver, clock, is, t, i, displaystyle, tilde, t, i, the, true, reception, time, is, t, i, t, i, b, displaystyle, t, i, tilde, t, i, b, where, b, is, the, receiver, s, clock, bias, from, the, much, more, accurate, gps, clocks, employed, by, the, satellites, the, receiver, clock, bias, is, the, same, for, all, received, satellite, signals, assuming, the, satellite, clocks, are, all, perfectly, synchronized, the, message, s, transit, time, is, t, i, b, s, i, displaystyle, tilde, t, i, b, s, i, where, s, i, is, the, satellite, time, assuming, the, message, traveled, at, the, speed, of, light, c, the, distance, traveled, is, t, i, b, s, i, c, displaystyle, left, tilde, t, i, b, s, i, right, c, for, n, satellites, the, equations, to, satisfy, are, where, d, i, is, the, geometric, distance, or, range, between, receiver, and, satellite, i, the, values, without, subscripts, are, the, x, y, and, z, components, of, receiver, position, defining, pseudoranges, as, p, i, t, i, s, i, c, displaystyle, p, i, left, tilde, t, i, s, i, right, c, we, see, they, are, biased, versions, of, the, true, range, since, the, equations, have, four, unknowns, the, three, components, of, gps, receiver, position, and, the, clock, bias, signals, from, at, least, four, satellites, are, necessary, to, attempt, solving, these, equations, they, can, be, solved, by, algebraic, or, numerical, methods, existence, and, uniqueness, of, gps, solutions, are, discussed, by, abell, and, chaffee, when, n, is, greater, than, four, this, system, is, overdetermined, and, a, fitting, method, must, be, used, the, amount, of, error, in, the, results, varies, with, the, received, satellites, locations, in, the, sky, since, certain, configurations, when, the, received, satellites, are, close, together, in, the, sky, cause, larger, errors, receivers, usually, calculate, a, running, estimate, of, the, error, in, the, calculated, position, this, is, done, by, multiplying, the, basic, resolution, of, the, receiver, by, quantities, called, the, geometric, dilution, of, position, gdop, factors, calculated, from, the, relative, sky, directions, of, the, satellites, used, the, receiver, location, is, expressed, in, a, specific, coordinate, system, such, as, latitude, and, longitude, using, the, wgs, 84, geodetic, datum, or, a, country, specific, system, the, gps, equations, can, be, solved, by, numerical, and, analytical, methods, geometrical, interpretations, can, enhance, the, understanding, of, these, solution, methods, the, measured, ranges, called, pseudoranges, contain, clock, errors, in, a, simplified, idealization, in, which, the, ranges, are, synchronized, these, true, ranges, represent, the, radii, of, spheres, each, centered, on, one, of, the, transmitting, satellites, the, solution, for, the, position, of, the, receiver, is, then, at, the, intersection, of, the, surfaces, of, these, spheres, see, trilateration, more, generally, true, range, multilateration, signals, from, at, minimum, three, satellites, are, required, and, their, three, spheres, would, typically, intersect, at, two, points, one, of, the, points, is, the, location, of, the, receiver, and, the, other, moves, rapidly, in, successive, measurements, and, would, not, usually, be, on, earth, s, surface, in, practice, there, are, many, sources, of, inaccuracy, besides, clock, bias, including, random, errors, as, well, as, the, potential, for, precision, loss, from, subtracting, numbers, close, to, each, other, if, the, centers, of, the, spheres, are, relatively, close, together, this, means, that, the, position, calculated, from, three, satellites, alone, is, unlikely, to, be, accurate, enough, data, from, more, satellites, can, help, because, of, the, tendency, for, random, errors, to, cancel, out, and, also, by, giving, a, larger, spread, between, the, sphere, centers, but, at, the, same, time, more, spheres, will, not, generally, intersect, at, one, point, therefore, a, near, intersection, gets, computed, typically, via, least, squares, the, more, signals, available, the, better, the, approximation, is, likely, to, be, if, the, pseudorange, between, the, receiver, and, satellite, i, and, the, pseudorange, between, the, receiver, and, satellite, j, are, subtracted, p, i, p, j, the, common, receiver, clock, bias, b, cancels, out, resulting, in, a, difference, of, distances, d, i, d, j, the, locus, of, points, having, a, constant, difference, in, distance, to, two, points, here, two, satellites, is, a, hyperbola, on, a, plane, and, a, hyperboloid, of, revolution, more, specifically, a, two, sheeted, hyperboloid, in, 3d, space, see, multilateration, thus, from, four, pseudorange, measurements, the, receiver, can, be, placed, at, the, intersection, of, the, surfaces, of, three, hyperboloids, each, with, foci, at, a, pair, of, satellites, with, additional, satellites, the, multiple, intersections, are, not, necessarily, unique, and, a, best, fitting, solution, is, sought, instead, the, receiver, position, can, be, interpreted, as, the, center, of, an, inscribed, sphere, insphere, of, radius, bc, given, by, the, receiver, clock, bias, b, scaled, by, the, speed, of, light, c, the, insphere, location, is, such, that, it, touches, other, spheres, the, circumscribing, spheres, are, centered, at, the, gps, satellites, whose, radii, equal, the, measured, pseudoranges, p, i, this, configuration, is, distinct, from, the, one, described, above, in, which, the, spheres, radii, were, the, unbiased, or, geometric, ranges, d, i, 36, 37, the, clock, in, the, receiver, is, usually, not, of, the, same, quality, as, the, ones, in, the, satellites, and, will, not, be, accurately, synchronized, to, them, this, produces, pseudoranges, with, large, differences, compared, to, the, true, distances, to, the, satellites, therefore, in, practice, the, time, difference, between, the, receiver, clock, and, the, satellite, time, is, defined, as, an, unknown, clock, bias, b, the, equations, are, then, solved, simultaneously, for, the, receiver, position, and, the, clock, bias, the, solution, space, can, be, seen, as, a, four, dimensional, spacetime, and, signals, from, at, minimum, four, satellites, are, needed, in, that, case, each, of, the, equations, describes, a, hypercone, or, spherical, cone, with, the, cusp, located, at, the, satellite, and, the, base, a, sphere, around, the, satellite, the, receiver, is, at, the, intersection, of, four, or, more, of, such, hypercones, when, more, than, four, satellites, are, available, the, calculation, can, use, the, four, best, or, more, than, four, simultaneously, up, to, all, visible, satellites, depending, on, the, number, of, receiver, channels, processing, capability, and, geometric, dilution, of, precision, gdop, using, more, than, four, involves, an, over, determined, system, of, equations, with, no, unique, solution, such, a, system, can, be, solved, by, a, least, squares, or, weighted, least, squares, method, both, the, equations, for, four, satellites, or, the, least, squares, equations, for, more, than, four, are, non, linear, and, need, special, solution, methods, a, common, approach, is, by, iteration, on, a, linearized, form, of, the, equations, such, as, the, gauss, newton, algorithm, the, gps, was, initially, developed, assuming, use, of, a, numerical, least, squares, solution, method, i, e, before, closed, form, solutions, were, found, one, closed, form, solution, to, the, above, set, of, equations, was, developed, by, s, bancroft, its, properties, are, well, known, in, particular, proponents, claim, it, is, superior, in, low, gdop, situations, compared, to, iterative, least, squares, methods, bancroft, s, method, is, algebraic, as, opposed, to, numerical, and, can, be, used, for, four, or, more, satellites, when, four, satellites, are, used, the, key, steps, are, inversion, of, a, 4x4, matrix, and, solution, of, a, single, variable, quadratic, equation, bancroft, s, method, provides, one, or, two, solutions, for, the, unknown, quantities, when, there, are, two, usually, the, case, only, one, is, a, near, earth, sensible, solution, when, a, receiver, uses, more, than, four, satellites, for, a, solution, bancroft, uses, the, generalized, inverse, i, e, the, pseudoinverse, to, find, a, solution, a, case, has, been, made, that, iterative, methods, such, as, the, gauss, newton, algorithm, approach, for, solving, over, determined, non, linear, least, squares, problems, generally, provide, more, accurate, solutions, leick, et, al, 2015, states, that, bancroft, s, 1985, solution, is, a, very, early, if, not, the, first, closed, form, solution, other, closed, form, solutions, were, published, afterwards, although, their, adoption, in, practice, is, unclear, gps, error, analysis, examines, error, sources, in, gps, results, and, the, expected, size, of, those, errors, gps, makes, corrections, for, receiver, clock, errors, and, other, effects, but, some, residual, errors, remain, uncorrected, error, sources, include, signal, arrival, time, measurements, numerical, calculations, atmospheric, effects, ionospheric, tropospheric, delays, ephemeris, and, clock, data, multipath, signals, and, natural, and, artificial, interference, magnitude, of, residual, errors, from, these, sources, depends, on, geometric, dilution, of, precision, artificial, errors, may, result, from, jamming, devices, and, threaten, ships, and, aircraft, or, from, intentional, signal, degradation, through, selective, availability, which, limited, accuracy, to, 6, 12, m, 20, 40, ft, but, has, been, switched, off, since,

have, discriminated, against, reception, of, mobile, satellite, services, such, as, inmarsat, without, any, issue, the, spectrum, allocated, for, gps, l1, use, by, the, fcc, is, 1559, to, 1610, mhz, while, the, spectrum, allocated, for, satellite, to, ground, use, owned, by, lightsquared, is, the, mobile, satellite, service, band, since, 1996, the, fcc, has, authorized, licensed, use, of, the, spectrum, neighboring, the, gps, band, of, 1525, to, 1559, mhz, to, the, virginia, company, lightsquared, on, march, 1, 2001, the, fcc, received, an, application, from, lightsquared, s, predecessor, motient, services, to, use, their, allocated, frequencies, for, an, integrated, satellite, terrestrial, service, in, 2002, the, u, s, gps, industry, council, came, to, an, out, of, band, emissions, oobe, agreement, with, lightsquared, to, prevent, transmissions, from, lightsquared, s, ground, based, stations, from, emitting, transmissions, into, the, neighboring, gps, band, of, 1559, to, 1610, mhz, in, 2004, the, fcc, adopted, the, oobe, agreement, in, its, authorization, for, lightsquared, to, deploy, a, ground, based, network, ancillary, to, their, satellite, system, known, as, the, ancillary, tower, components, atcs, we, will, authorize, mss, atc, subject, to, conditions, that, ensure, that, the, added, terrestrial, component, remains, ancillary, to, the, principal, mss, offering, we, do, not, intend, nor, will, we, permit, the, terrestrial, component, to, become, a, stand, alone, service, this, authorization, was, reviewed, and, approved, by, the, u, s, interdepartment, radio, advisory, committee, which, includes, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, u, s, space, force, u, s, army, u, s, coast, guard, federal, aviation, administration, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, nasa, u, s, department, of, the, interior, and, u, s, department, of, transportation, in, january, 2011, the, fcc, conditionally, authorized, lightsquared, s, wholesale, customers, such, as, best, buy, sharp, and, c, spire, to, only, purchase, an, integrated, satellite, ground, based, service, from, lightsquared, and, re, sell, that, integrated, service, on, devices, that, are, equipped, to, only, use, the, ground, based, signal, using, lightsquared, s, allocated, frequencies, of, 1525, to, 1559, mhz, in, december, 2010, gps, receiver, manufacturers, expressed, concerns, to, the, fcc, that, lightsquared, s, signal, would, interfere, with, gps, receiver, devices, although, the, fcc, s, policy, considerations, leading, up, to, the, january, 2011, order, did, not, pertain, to, any, proposed, changes, to, the, maximum, number, of, ground, based, lightsquared, stations, or, the, maximum, power, at, which, these, stations, could, operate, the, january, 2011, order, makes, final, authorization, contingent, upon, studies, of, gps, interference, issues, carried, out, by, a, lightsquared, led, working, group, along, with, gps, industry, and, federal, agency, participation, on, february, 14, 2012, the, fcc, initiated, proceedings, to, vacate, lightsquared, s, conditional, waiver, order, based, on, the, ntia, s, conclusion, that, there, was, currently, no, practical, way, to, mitigate, potential, gps, interference, gps, receiver, manufacturers, design, gps, receivers, to, use, spectrum, beyond, the, gps, allocated, band, in, some, cases, gps, receivers, are, designed, to, use, up, to, 400, mhz, of, spectrum, in, either, direction, of, the, l1, frequency, of, 1575, 42, mhz, because, mobile, satellite, services, in, those, regions, are, broadcasting, from, space, to, ground, and, at, power, levels, commensurate, with, mobile, satellite, services, as, regulated, under, the, fcc, s, part, 15, rules, gps, receivers, are, not, warranted, protection, from, signals, outside, gps, allocated, spectrum, this, is, why, gps, operates, next, to, the, mobile, satellite, service, band, and, also, why, the, mobile, satellite, service, band, operates, next, to, gps, the, symbiotic, relationship, of, spectrum, allocation, ensures, that, users, of, both, bands, are, able, to, operate, cooperatively, and, freely, the, fcc, adopted, rules, in, february, 2003, that, allowed, mobile, satellite, service, mss, licensees, such, as, lightsquared, to, construct, a, small, number, of, ancillary, ground, based, towers, in, their, licensed, spectrum, to, promote, more, efficient, use, of, terrestrial, wireless, spectrum, in, those, 2003, rules, the, fcc, stated, as, a, preliminary, matter, terrestrial, and, mss, atc, are, expected, to, have, different, prices, coverage, product, acceptance, and, distribution, therefore, the, two, services, appear, at, best, to, be, imperfect, substitutes, for, one, another, that, would, be, operating, in, predominantly, different, market, segments, mss, atc, is, unlikely, to, compete, directly, with, terrestrial, cmrs, for, the, same, customer, base, in, 2004, the, fcc, clarified, that, the, ground, based, towers, would, be, ancillary, noting, we, will, authorize, mss, atc, subject, to, conditions, that, ensure, that, the, added, terrestrial, component, remains, ancillary, to, the, principal, mss, offering, we, do, not, intend, nor, will, we, permit, the, terrestrial, component, to, become, a, stand, alone, service, in, july, 2010, the, fcc, stated, that, it, expected, lightsquared, to, use, its, authority, to, offer, an, integrated, satellite, terrestrial, service, to, provide, mobile, broadband, services, similar, to, those, provided, by, terrestrial, mobile, providers, and, enhance, competition, in, the, mobile, broadband, sector, gps, receiver, manufacturers, have, argued, that, lightsquared, s, licensed, spectrum, of, 1525, to, 1559, mhz, was, never, envisioned, as, being, used, for, high, speed, wireless, broadband, based, on, the, 2003, and, 2004, fcc, atc, rulings, making, clear, that, the, ancillary, tower, component, atc, would, be, in, fact, ancillary, to, the, primary, satellite, component, to, build, public, support, of, efforts, to, continue, the, 2004, fcc, authorization, of, lightsquared, s, ancillary, terrestrial, component, vs, a, simple, ground, based, lte, service, in, the, mobile, satellite, service, band, gps, receiver, manufacturer, trimble, navigation, ltd, formed, the, coalition, to, save, our, gps, the, fcc, and, lightsquared, have, each, made, public, commitments, to, solve, the, gps, interference, issue, before, the, network, is, allowed, to, operate, according, to, chris, dancy, of, the, aircraft, owners, and, pilots, association, airline, pilots, with, the, type, of, systems, that, would, be, affected, may, go, off, course, and, not, even, realize, it, the, problems, could, also, affect, the, federal, aviation, administration, upgrade, to, the, air, traffic, control, system, united, states, defense, department, guidance, and, local, emergency, services, including, 911, on, february, 14, 2012, the, fcc, moved, to, bar, lightsquared, s, planned, national, broadband, network, after, being, informed, by, the, national, telecommunications, and, information, administration, ntia, the, federal, agency, that, coordinates, spectrum, uses, for, the, military, and, other, federal, government, entities, that, there, is, no, practical, way, to, mitigate, potential, interference, at, this, time, lightsquared, is, challenging, the, fcc, s, action, following, the, united, states, deployment, of, gps, other, countries, have, also, developed, their, own, satellite, navigation, systems, these, systems, include
