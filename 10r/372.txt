a, gasket, is, a, mechanical, seal, which, fills, the, space, between, two, or, more, mating, surfaces, generally, to, prevent, leakage, from, or, into, the, joined, objects, while, under, compression, it, is, a, deformable, material, that, is, used, to, create, a, static, seal, and, maintain, that, seal, under, various, operating, conditions, in, a, mechanical, assembly, gaskets, allow, for, less, than, perfect, mating, surfaces, on, machine, parts, where, they, can, fill, irregularities, gaskets, are, commonly, produced, by, cutting, from, sheet, materials, given, the, potential, cost, and, safety, implications, of, faulty, or, leaking, gaskets, it, is, critical, that, the, correct, gasket, material, is, selected, to, fit, the, needs, of, the, application, gaskets, for, specific, applications, such, as, high, pressure, steam, systems, may, contain, asbestos, however, due, to, health, hazards, associated, with, asbestos, exposure, non, asbestos, gasket, materials, are, used, when, practical, it, is, usually, desirable, that, the, gasket, be, made, from, a, material, that, is, to, some, degree, yielding, such, that, it, is, able, to, deform, and, tightly, fill, the, space, it, is, designed, for, including, any, slight, irregularities, some, types, of, gaskets, require, a, sealant, be, applied, directly, to, the, gasket, surface, to, function, properly, some, piping, gaskets, are, made, entirely, of, metal, and, rely, on, a, seating, surface, to, accomplish, the, seal, the, metal, s, own, spring, characteristics, are, utilized, up, to, but, not, passing, y, the, material, s, yield, strength, this, is, typical, of, some, ring, joints, rtj, or, some, other, metal, gasket, systems, these, joints, are, known, as, r, con, and, e, con, compressive, type, joints, some, gaskets, are, dispensed, and, cured, in, place, these, materials, are, called, formed, in, place, gaskets, gaskets, are, normally, made, from, a, flat, material, a, sheet, such, as, paper, rubber, silicone, metal, cork, felt, neoprene, nitrile, rubber, fiberglass, polytetrafluoroethylene, otherwise, known, as, ptfe, or, teflon, or, a, plastic, polymer, such, as, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, one, of, the, more, desirable, properties, of, an, effective, gasket, in, industrial, applications, for, compressed, fiber, gasket, material, is, the, ability, to, withstand, high, compressive, loads, most, industrial, gasket, applications, involve, bolts, exerting, compression, well, into, the, 14, mpa, 2000, psi, range, or, higher, generally, speaking, there, are, several, truisms, that, allow, for, better, gasket, performance, one, of, the, more, tried, and, tested, is, the, more, compressive, load, exerted, on, the, gasket, the, longer, it, will, last, there, are, several, ways, to, measure, a, gasket, material, s, ability, to, withstand, compressive, loading, the, hot, compression, test, is, probably, the, most, accepted, of, these, tests, most, manufacturers, of, gasket, materials, will, provide, or, publish, the, results, of, these, tests, gaskets, come, in, many, different, designs, based, on, industrial, usage, budget, chemical, contact, and, physical, parameters, gaskets, can, be, produced, by, punching, the, required, shape, out, of, a, sheet, of, flat, thin, material, resulting, in, a, sheet, gaskets, sheet, gasket, are, fast, and, cheap, to, produce, and, can, be, produced, from, a, variety, of, materials, among, them, fibrous, materials, and, matted, graphite, and, in, the, past, compressed, asbestos, these, gaskets, can, fill, various, different, chemical, requirements, based, on, the, inertness, of, the, material, used, non, asbestos, gasket, sheet, is, durable, of, multiple, materials, and, thick, in, nature, material, examples, are, mineral, carbon, or, synthetic, rubbers, such, as, epdm, nitrile, neoprene, natural, sbr, insertion, each, of, which, have, unique, properties, suitable, for, different, applications, applications, using, sheet, gaskets, involve, acids, corrosive, chemicals, steam, or, mild, caustics, flexibility, and, good, recovery, prevent, breakage, during, installation, of, a, sheet, gasket, the, idea, behind, solid, material, is, to, use, metals, which, cannot, be, punched, out, of, sheets, but, are, still, cheap, to, produce, these, gaskets, generally, have, a, much, higher, level, of, quality, control, than, sheet, gaskets, and, generally, can, withstand, much, higher, temperatures, and, pressures, the, key, downside, is, that, a, solid, metal, must, be, greatly, compressed, in, order, to, become, flush, with, the, flange, head, and, prevent, leakage, the, material, choice, is, more, difficult, because, metals, are, primarily, used, process, contamination, and, oxidation, are, risks, an, additional, downside, is, that, the, metal, used, must, be, softer, than, the, flange, in, order, to, ensure, that, the, flange, does, not, warp, and, thereby, prevent, sealing, with, future, gaskets, even, so, these, gaskets, have, found, a, niche, in, industry, spiral, wound, gaskets, comprise, a, mix, of, metallic, and, filler, material, generally, the, gasket, has, a, metal, normally, carbon, rich, or, stainless, steel, wound, outwards, in, a, circular, spiral, other, shapes, are, possible, with, the, filler, material, generally, a, flexible, graphite, wound, in, the, same, manner, but, starting, from, the, opposing, side, this, results, in, alternating, layers, of, filler, and, metal, the, filler, material, in, these, gaskets, acts, as, the, sealing, element, with, the, metal, providing, structural, support, these, gaskets, have, proven, to, be, reliable, in, most, applications, and, allow, lower, clamping, forces, than, solid, gaskets, albeit, with, a, higher, cost, the, constant, seating, stress, gasket, consists, of, two, components, a, solid, carrier, ring, of, a, suitable, material, such, as, stainless, steel, and, two, sealing, elements, of, some, compressible, material, installed, within, two, opposing, channels, one, channel, on, either, side, of, the, carrier, ring, the, sealing, elements, are, typically, made, from, a, material, expanded, graphite, expanded, polytetrafluoroethylene, ptfe, vermiculite, etc, suitable, to, the, process, fluid, and, application, constant, seating, stress, gaskets, derive, their, name, from, the, fact, that, the, carrier, ring, profile, takes, flange, rotation, deflection, under, bolt, preload, into, consideration, with, all, other, conventional, gaskets, as, the, flange, fasteners, are, tightened, the, flange, deflects, radially, under, load, resulting, in, the, greatest, gasket, compression, and, highest, gasket, stress, at, the, outer, gasket, edge, since, the, carrier, ring, used, in, constant, seating, stress, gaskets, take, this, deflection, into, account, when, creating, the, carrier, ring, for, a, given, flange, size, pressure, class, and, material, the, carrier, ring, profile, can, be, adjusted, to, enable, the, gasket, seating, stress, to, be, radially, uniform, across, the, entire, sealing, area, further, because, the, sealing, elements, are, fully, confined, by, the, flange, faces, in, opposing, channels, on, the, carrier, ring, any, in, service, compressive, forces, acting, on, the, gasket, are, transmitted, through, the, carrier, ring, and, avoid, any, further, compression, of, the, sealing, elements, thus, maintaining, a, constant, gasket, seating, stress, while, in, service, thus, the, gasket, is, immune, to, common, gasket, failure, modes, that, include, creep, relaxation, high, system, vibration, or, system, thermal, cycles, the, fundamental, concept, underlying, the, improved, sealability, for, constant, seating, stress, gaskets, are, that, i, if, the, flange, sealing, surfaces, are, capable, of, attaining, a, seal, ii, the, sealing, elements, are, compatible, with, the, process, fluid, and, application, and, iii, the, sufficient, gasket, seating, stress, is, achieved, on, installation, necessary, to, affect, a, seal, then, the, possibility, of, the, gasket, leaking, in, service, is, greatly, reduced, or, eliminated, altogether, double, jacketed, gaskets, are, another, combination, of, filler, material, and, metallic, materials, in, this, application, a, tube, with, ends, that, resemble, a, c, is, made, of, the, metal, with, an, additional, piece, made, to, fit, inside, of, the, c, making, the, tube, thickest, at, the, meeting, points, the, filler, is, pumped, between, the, shell, and, piece, when, in, use, the, compressed, gasket, has, a, larger, amount, of, metal, at, the, two, tips, where, contact, is, made, due, to, the, shell, piece, interaction, and, these, two, places, bear, the, burden, of, sealing, the, process, since, all, that, is, needed, is, a, shell, and, piece, these, gaskets, can, be, made, from, almost, any, material, that, can, be, made, into, a, sheet, and, a, filler, can, then, be, inserted, kammprofile, gaskets, sometimes, spelled, camprofile, due, to, their, design, resembling, the, profile, of, a, camshaft, which, is, a, rotating, component, in, internal, combustion, engines, are, used, in, many, older, seals, since, they, have, both, a, flexible, nature, and, reliable, performance, kammprofiles, work, by, having, a, solid, corrugated, core, with, a, flexible, covering, layer, this, arrangement, allows, for, very, high, compression, and, an, extremely, tight, seal, along, the, ridges, of, the, gasket, since, generally, the, graphite, will, fail, instead, of, the, metal, core, kammprofile, can, be, repaired, during, later, inactivity, kammprofile, has, a, high, capital, cost, for, most, applications, but, this, is, countered, by, long, life, and, increased, reliability, fishbone, gaskets, are, direct, replacements, for, kammprofile, and, spiralwound, gaskets, they, are, fully, cnc, machine, manufactured, from, similar, materials, but, the, design, of, the, gaskets, has, eliminated, inherent, short, comings, fishbone, gaskets, do, not, unwind, in, storage, or, in, the, plant, the, rounded, edges, do, not, cause, flange, damage, the, added, stop, step, prevents, the, fishbone, gaskets, from, being, over, compressed, crushed, often, caused, by, hot, torque, techniques, on, plant, start, up, the, bones, of, the, gasket, remain, ductile, and, adjust, to, thermal, cycling, and, system, pressure, spikes, resulting, in, a, durable, and, reliable, flange, seal, that, out, performs, all, other, gaskets, of, this, nature, significantly, a, flange, gasket, is, a, type, of, gasket, made, to, fit, between, two, sections, of, pipe, that, are, flared, to, provide, higher, surface, area, flange, gaskets, come, in, a, variety, of, sizes, and, are, categorized, by, their, inside, diameter, and, their, outside, diameter, there, are, many, standards, in, gasket, for, flanges, of, pipes, the, gaskets, for, flanges, can, be, divided, into, four, major, categories, sheet, gaskets, are, simple, they, are, cut, to, size, either, with, bolt, holes, or, without, holes, for, standard, sizes, with, various, thickness, and, material, suitable, to, media, and, temperature, pressure, of, pipeline, ring, gaskets, also, known, as, rtj, they, are, mostly, used, in, offshore, oil, and, gas, pipelines, and, are, designed, to, work, under, extremely, high, pressure, they, are, solid, rings, of, metal, in, different, cross, sections, like, oval, round, octagonal, etc, sometimes, they, come, with, hole, in, center, for, pressure, spiral, wound, gaskets, are, also, used, in, high, pressure, pipelines, and, are, made, with, stainless, steel, outer, and, inner, rings, and, a, center, filled, with, spirally, wound, stainless, steel, tape, wound, together, with, graphite, and, ptfe, formed, in, v, shape, internal, pressure, acts, upon, the, faces, of, the, v, forcing, the, gasket, to, seal, against, the, flange, faces, most, spiral, wound, gasket, applications, will, use, two, standard, gasket, thicknesses, 1, 8, inch, and, 3, 16, inch, with, 1, 8, inch, thick, gaskets, compression, to, a, 0, 100, inch, thickness, is, recommended, for, 3, 16, inches, compress, to, a, 0, 13, inch, thickness, soft, gasket, is, a, term, that, refers, to, a, gasket, that, is, cut, from, a, soft, flexible, sheet, material, and, can, easily, conform, to, surface, irregularities, even, when, the, bolt, load, is, low, soft, gaskets, are, used, in, applications, such, as, heat, exchangers, compressors, bonnet, valve, and, pipe, flanges, annular, seal, rtj, seal, is, a, high, integrity, high, temperature, high, pressure, seal, for, applications, in, the, oil, industry, oilfield, drilling, pressure, vessel, connections, pipes, valves, and, more, the, movement, of, the, ring, packing, rtj, can, be, described, as, an, irregular, flow, in, the, groove, of, the, deformed, sealing, flange, due, to, the, axial, compressive, load, colored, seal, rtj, seal, has, a, small, load, area, which, leads, to, a, large, surface, pressure, between, the, sealing, surface, and, the, groove, the, maintenance, properties, are, poor, and, not, suitable, for, reuse, many, gaskets, contain, minor, improvements, to, increase, or, infer, acceptable, operating, conditions, uneven, pressure, can, be, caused, by, a, variety, of, factors, first, is, the, human, factor, asymmetric, application, of, the, bolt, preload, this, can, cause, uneven, pressure, theoretically, when, the, flanges, are, pressed, the, sealing, surfaces, are, absolutely, parallel, in, practice, however, the, centerline, of, a, pipeline, cannot, be, absolutely, concentric, and, tightening, the, bolts, on, the, flange, moment, makes, the, flange, a, discontinuity, with, asymmetric, connections, the, seal, surfaces, will, be, more, or, less, deformed, and, the, pressure, reduced, the, running, load, prone, to, leakage, third, the, density, of, bolt, arrangement, has, an, obvious, impact, on, the, pressure, distribution, the, closer, the, bolts, the, more, uniform, the, pressure, tighten, the, bolts, on, the, flange, due, to, vibration, temperature, changes, and, other, factors, such, as, spiral, wound, gasket, stress, relaxation, the, bolt, tension, will, gradually, decrease, resulting, in, loss, of, torque, causing, a, leak, in, general, longer, bolts, and, smaller, diameters, of, bolt, are, better, at, preventing, the, loss, of, torque, a, long, thin, bolt, is, an, effective, way, to, prevent, torque, loss, heating, for, a, certain, period, of, time, to, stretch, the, bolt, and, then, maintaining, a, given, torque, is, very, effective, in, preventing, the, loss, of, torque, when, the, gasket, is, thinner, and, smaller, there, will, be, a, greater, loss, of, torque, in, addition, prevent, strong, vibration, of, the, machine, and, the, pipe, itself, and, isolate, them, from, adjacent, equipment, vibration, impacts, on, the, sealing, surface, are, not, meaningless, not, impacting, the, tightened, bolts, can, prevent, the, loss, of, torque, it, is, important, to, make, the, sealing, finish, properly, otherwise, it, will, cause, leakage, a, surface, that, is, too, smooth, can, allow, your, gasket, material, to, blow, out, under, pressure, a, surface, that, is, not, machined, flat, can, provide, leak, paths, a, good, rule, of, thumb, is, a, machined, surface, to, 32rms, this, insures, the, surface, is, flat, but, with, enough, surface, finish, to, bite, into, the, gasket, under, compression, with, metal, core, coated, gaskets, both, sides, of, the, core, are, covered, with, a, flexible, malleable, sealant, there, are, reinforced, metal, seals, in, the, pressure, class, up, to, 300, a, strong, metal, core, prevents, pressure, seals, and, a, soft, core, ensures, exceptional, sealing
