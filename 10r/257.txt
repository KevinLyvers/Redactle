die, casting, is, a, metal, casting, process, that, is, characterized, by, forcing, molten, metal, under, high, pressure, into, a, mold, cavity, the, mold, cavity, is, created, using, two, hardened, tool, steel, dies, which, have, been, machined, into, shape, and, work, similarly, to, an, injection, mold, during, the, process, most, die, castings, are, made, from, non, ferrous, metals, specifically, zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter, and, tin, based, alloys, depending, on, the, type, of, metal, being, cast, a, hot, or, cold, chamber, machine, is, used, the, casting, equipment, and, the, metal, dies, represent, large, capital, costs, and, this, tends, to, limit, the, process, to, high, volume, production, manufacture, of, parts, using, die, casting, is, relatively, simple, involving, only, four, main, steps, which, keeps, the, incremental, cost, per, item, low, it, is, especially, suited, for, a, large, quantity, of, small, to, medium, sized, castings, which, is, why, die, casting, produces, more, castings, than, any, other, casting, process, die, castings, are, characterized, by, a, very, good, surface, finish, by, casting, standards, and, dimensional, consistency, die, casting, equipment, was, invented, in, 1838, for, the, purpose, of, producing, movable, type, for, the, printing, industry, the, first, die, casting, related, patent, was, granted, in, 1849, for, a, small, hand, operated, machine, for, the, purpose, of, mechanized, printing, type, production, in, 1885, ottmar, mergenthaler, invented, the, linotype, machine, which, cast, an, entire, line, of, type, as, a, single, unit, using, a, die, casting, process, it, nearly, completely, replaced, setting, type, by, hand, in, the, publishing, industry, the, soss, die, casting, machine, manufactured, in, brooklyn, ny, was, the, first, machine, to, be, sold, in, the, open, market, in, north, america, other, applications, grew, rapidly, with, die, casting, facilitating, the, growth, of, consumer, goods, and, appliances, by, greatly, reducing, the, production, cost, of, intricate, parts, in, high, volumes, in, 1966, general, motors, released, the, acurad, process, the, main, die, casting, alloys, are, zinc, aluminium, magnesium, copper, lead, and, tin, although, uncommon, ferrous, die, casting, is, also, possible, specific, die, casting, alloys, include, zinc, aluminium, aluminium, to, e, g, the, aluminum, association, aa, standards, aa, 380, aa, 384, aa, 386, aa, 390, and, az91d, magnesium, the, following, is, a, summary, of, the, advantages, of, each, alloy, as, of, 2008, maximum, weight, limits, for, aluminium, brass, magnesium, and, zinc, castings, are, estimated, at, approximately, 70, pounds, 32, kg, 10, lb, 4, 5, kg, 44, lb, 20, kg, and, 75, lb, 34, kg, respectively, by, late, 2019, press, machines, capable, of, die, casting, single, pieces, over, 100, kilograms, 220, lb, were, being, used, to, produce, aluminium, chassis, components, for, cars, the, material, used, defines, the, minimum, section, thickness, and, minimum, draft, required, for, a, casting, as, outlined, in, the, table, below, the, thickest, section, should, be, less, than, 13, mm, 0, 5, in, but, can, be, greater, there, are, a, number, of, geometric, features, to, be, considered, when, creating, a, parametric, model, of, a, die, casting, there, are, two, basic, types, of, die, casting, machines, hot, chamber, machines, and, cold, chamber, machines, these, are, rated, by, how, much, clamping, force, they, can, apply, typical, ratings, are, between, 400, and, 4, 000, st, 2, 500, and, 25, 400, kg, hot, chamber, die, casting, also, known, as, gooseneck, machines, rely, upon, a, pool, of, molten, metal, to, feed, the, die, at, the, beginning, of, the, cycle, the, piston, of, the, machine, is, retracted, which, allows, the, molten, metal, to, fill, the, gooseneck, the, pneumatic, or, hydraulic, powered, piston, then, forces, this, metal, out, of, the, gooseneck, into, the, die, the, advantages, of, this, system, include, fast, cycle, times, approximately, 15, cycles, a, minute, and, the, convenience, of, melting, the, metal, in, the, casting, machine, the, disadvantages, of, this, system, are, that, it, is, limited, to, use, with, low, melting, point, metals, and, that, aluminium, cannot, be, used, because, it, picks, up, some, of, the, iron, while, in, the, molten, pool, therefore, hot, chamber, machines, are, primarily, used, with, zinc, tin, and, lead, based, alloys, these, are, used, when, the, casting, alloy, cannot, be, used, in, hot, chamber, machines, these, include, aluminium, zinc, alloys, with, a, large, composition, of, aluminium, magnesium, and, copper, the, process, for, these, machines, start, with, melting, the, metal, in, a, separate, furnace, then, a, precise, amount, of, molten, metal, is, transported, to, the, cold, chamber, machine, where, it, is, fed, into, an, unheated, shot, chamber, or, injection, cylinder, this, shot, is, then, driven, into, the, die, by, a, hydraulic, or, mechanical, piston, the, biggest, disadvantage, of, this, system, is, the, slower, cycle, time, due, to, the, need, to, transfer, the, molten, metal, from, the, furnace, to, the, cold, chamber, machine, two, dies, are, used, in, die, casting, one, is, called, the, cover, die, half, and, the, other, the, ejector, die, half, where, they, meet, is, called, the, parting, line, the, cover, die, contains, the, sprue, for, hot, chamber, machines, or, shot, hole, for, cold, chamber, machines, which, allows, the, molten, metal, to, flow, into, the, dies, this, feature, matches, up, with, the, injector, nozzle, on, the, hot, chamber, machines, or, the, shot, chamber, in, the, cold, chamber, machines, the, ejector, die, contains, the, ejector, pins, and, usually, the, runner, which, is, the, path, from, the, sprue, or, shot, hole, to, the, mould, cavity, the, cover, die, is, secured, to, the, stationary, or, front, platen, of, the, casting, machine, while, the, ejector, die, is, attached, to, the, movable, platen, the, mould, cavity, is, cut, into, two, cavity, inserts, which, are, separate, pieces, that, can, be, replaced, relatively, easily, and, bolt, into, the, die, halves, the, dies, are, designed, so, that, the, finished, casting, will, slide, off, the, cover, half, of, the, die, and, stay, in, the, ejector, half, as, the, dies, are, opened, this, assures, that, the, casting, will, be, ejected, every, cycle, because, the, ejector, half, contains, the, ejector, pins, to, push, the, casting, out, of, that, die, half, the, ejector, pins, are, driven, by, an, ejector, pin, plate, which, accurately, drives, all, of, the, pins, at, the, same, time, and, with, the, same, force, so, that, the, casting, is, not, damaged, the, ejector, pin, plate, also, retracts, the, pins, after, ejecting, the, casting, to, prepare, for, the, next, shot, there, must, be, enough, ejector, pins, to, keep, the, overall, force, on, each, pin, low, because, the, casting, is, still, hot, and, can, be, damaged, by, excessive, force, the, pins, still, leave, a, mark, so, they, must, be, located, in, places, where, these, marks, will, not, hamper, the, casting, s, purpose, other, die, components, include, cores, and, slides, cores, are, components, that, usually, produce, holes, or, opening, but, they, can, be, used, to, create, other, details, as, well, there, are, three, types, of, cores, fixed, movable, and, loose, fixed, cores, are, ones, that, are, oriented, parallel, to, the, pull, direction, of, the, dies, i, e, the, direction, the, dies, open, therefore, they, are, fixed, or, permanently, attached, to, the, die, movable, cores, are, ones, that, are, oriented, in, any, other, way, than, parallel, to, the, pull, direction, these, cores, must, be, removed, from, the, die, cavity, after, the, shot, solidifies, but, before, the, dies, open, using, a, separate, mechanism, slides, are, similar, to, movable, cores, except, they, are, used, to, form, undercut, surfaces, the, use, of, movable, cores, and, slides, greatly, increases, the, cost, of, the, dies, loose, cores, also, called, pick, outs, are, used, to, cast, intricate, features, such, as, threaded, holes, these, loose, cores, are, inserted, into, the, die, by, hand, before, each, cycle, and, then, ejected, with, the, part, at, the, end, of, the, cycle, the, core, then, must, be, removed, by, hand, loose, cores, are, the, most, expensive, type, of, core, because, of, the, extra, labor, and, increased, cycle, time, other, features, in, the, dies, include, water, cooling, passages, and, vents, along, the, parting, lines, these, vents, are, usually, wide, and, thin, approximately, 0, 13, mm, or, 0, 005, in, so, that, when, the, molten, metal, starts, filling, them, the, metal, quickly, solidifies, and, minimizes, scrap, no, risers, are, used, because, the, high, pressure, ensures, a, continuous, feed, of, metal, from, the, gate, the, most, important, material, properties, for, the, dies, are, thermal, shock, resistance, and, softening, at, elevated, temperature, other, important, properties, include, hardenability, machinability, heat, checking, resistance, weldability, availability, especially, for, larger, dies, and, cost, the, longevity, of, a, die, is, directly, dependent, on, the, temperature, of, the, molten, metal, and, the, cycle, time, the, dies, used, in, die, casting, are, usually, made, out, of, hardened, tool, steels, because, cast, iron, cannot, withstand, the, high, pressures, involved, therefore, the, dies, are, very, expensive, resulting, in, high, start, up, costs, metals, that, are, cast, at, higher, temperatures, require, dies, made, from, higher, alloy, steels, the, main, failure, mode, for, die, casting, dies, is, wear, or, erosion, other, failure, modes, are, heat, checking, and, thermal, fatigue, heat, checking, is, when, surface, cracks, occur, on, the, die, due, to, a, large, temperature, change, on, every, cycle, thermal, fatigue, is, when, surface, cracks, occur, on, the, die, due, to, a, large, number, of, cycles, the, following, are, the, four, steps, in, traditional, die, casting, also, known, as, high, pressure, die, casting, these, are, also, the, basis, for, any, of, the, die, casting, variations, die, preparation, filling, ejection, and, shakeout, the, dies, are, prepared, by, spraying, the, mould, cavity, with, lubricant, the, lubricant, both, helps, control, the, temperature, of, the, die, and, it, also, assists, in, the, removal, of, the, casting, the, dies, are, then, closed, and, molten, metal, is, injected, into, the, dies, under, high, pressure, between, 10, and, 175, megapascals, 1, 500, and, 25, 400, psi, once, the, mould, cavity, is, filled, the, pressure, is, maintained, until, the, casting, solidifies, the, dies, are, then, opened, and, the, shot, shots, are, different, from, castings, because, there, can, be, multiple, cavities, in, a, die, yielding, multiple, castings, per, shot, is, ejected, by, the, ejector, pins, finally, the, shakeout, involves, separating, the, scrap, which, includes, the, gate, runners, sprues, and, flash, from, the, shot, this, is, often, done, using, a, special, trim, die, in, a, power, press, or, hydraulic, press, other, methods, of, shaking, out, include, sawing, and, grinding, a, less, labor, intensive, method, is, to, tumble, shots, if, gates, are, thin, and, easily, broken, separation, of, gates, from, finished, parts, must, follow, this, scrap, is, recycled, by, remelting, it, the, yield, is, approximately, 67, the, high, pressure, injection, leads, to, a, quick, fill, of, the, die, which, is, required, so, the, entire, cavity, fills, before, any, part, of, the, casting, solidifies, in, this, way, discontinuities, are, avoided, even, if, the, shape, requires, difficult, to, fill, thin, sections, this, creates, the, problem, of, air, entrapment, because, when, the, mould, is, filled, quickly, there, is, little, time, for, the, air, to, escape, this, problem, is, minimized, by, including, vents, along, the, parting, lines, however, even, in, a, highly, refined, process, there, will, still, be, some, porosity, in, the, center, of, the, casting, most, die, casters, perform, other, secondary, operations, to, produce, features, not, readily, castable, such, as, tapping, a, hole, polishing, plating, buffing, or, painting, after, the, shakeout, of, the, casting, it, is, inspected, for, defects, the, most, common, defects, are, misruns, and, cold, shuts, these, defects, can, be, caused, by, cold, dies, low, metal, temperature, dirty, metal, lack, of, venting, or, too, much, lubricant, other, possible, defects, are, gas, porosity, shrinkage, porosity, hot, tears, and, flow, marks, flow, marks, are, marks, left, on, the, surface, of, the, casting, due, to, poor, gating, sharp, corners, or, excessive, lubricant, water, based, lubricants, are, the, most, used, type, of, lubricant, because, of, health, environmental, and, safety, reasons, unlike, solvent, based, lubricants, if, water, is, properly, treated, to, remove, all, minerals, from, it, it, will, not, leave, any, by, product, in, the, dies, if, the, water, is, not, properly, treated, then, the, minerals, can, cause, surface, defects, and, discontinuities, today, water, in, oil, and, oil, in, water, emulsions, are, used, because, when, the, lubricant, is, applied, the, water, cools, the, die, surface, by, evaporating, hence, depositing, the, oil, that, helps, release, the, shot, a, common, mixture, for, this, type, of, emulsion, is, thirty, parts, water, to, one, part, oil, however, in, extreme, cases, a, ratio, of, one, hundred, to, one, is, used, oils, that, are, used, include, heavy, residual, oil, hro, animal, fat, vegetable, fat, synthetic, oil, and, all, sorts, of, mixtures, of, these, hros, are, gelatinous, at, room, temperature, but, at, the, high, temperatures, found, in, die, casting, they, form, a, thin, film, other, substances, are, added, to, control, the, viscosity, and, thermal, properties, of, these, emulsions, e, g, graphite, aluminium, mica, other, chemical, additives, are, used, to, inhibit, rusting, and, oxidation, in, addition, emulsifiers, are, added, to, improve, the, emulsion, manufacturing, process, e, g, soap, alcohol, esters, ethylene, oxides, historically, solvent, based, lubricants, such, as, diesel, fuel, and, kerosene, were, commonly, used, these, were, good, at, releasing, the, part, from, the, die, but, a, small, explosion, occurred, during, each, shot, which, led, to, a, build, up, of, carbon, on, the, mould, cavity, walls, however, they, were, easier, to, apply, evenly, than, water, based, lubricants, advantages, of, die, casting, the, main, disadvantage, to, die, casting, is, the, very, high, capital, cost, both, the, casting, equipment, required, and, the, dies, and, related, components, are, very, costly, as, compared, to, most, other, casting, processes, therefore, to, make, die, casting, an, economic, process, a, large, production, volume, is, needed, other, disadvantages, are, acurad, was, a, die, casting, process, developed, by, general, motors, in, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, name, is, an, acronym, for, accurate, reliable, and, dense, it, was, developed, to, combine, a, stable, fill, and, directional, solidification, with, the, fast, cycle, times, of, the, traditional, die, casting, process, the, process, pioneered, four, breakthrough, technologies, for, die, casting, thermal, analysis, flow, and, fill, modeling, heat, treatable, and, high, integrity, die, castings, and, indirect, squeeze, casting, explained, below, the, thermal, analysis, was, the, first, done, for, any, casting, process, this, was, done, by, creating, an, electrical, analog, of, the, thermal, system, a, cross, section, of, the, dies, were, drawn, on, teledeltos, paper, and, then, thermal, loads, and, cooling, patterns, were, drawn, onto, the, paper, water, lines, were, represented, by, magnets, of, various, sizes, the, thermal, conductivity, was, represented, by, the, reciprocal, of, the, resistivity, of, the, paper, the, acurad, system, employed, a, bottom, fill, system, that, required, a, stable, flow, front, logical, thought, processes, and, trial, and, error, were, used, because, computerized, analysis, did, not, exist, yet, however, this, modeling, was, the, precursor, to, computerized, flow, and, fill, modeling, the, acurad, system, was, the, first, die, casting, process, that, could, successfully, cast, low, iron, aluminium, alloys, such, as, a356, and, a357, in, a, traditional, die, casting, process, these, alloys, would, solder, to, the, die, similarly, acurad, castings, could, be, heat, treated, and, meet, the, u, s, military, specification, mil, a, 21180, d, finally, the, acurad, system, employed, a, patented, double, shot, piston, design, the, idea, was, to, use, a, second, piston, located, within, the, primary, piston, to, apply, pressure, after, the, shot, had, partially, solidified, around, the, perimeter, of, the, casting, cavity, and, shot, sleeve, while, the, system, was, not, very, effective, it, did, lead, the, manufacturer, of, the, acurad, machines, ube, industries, to, discover, that, it, was, just, as, effective, to, apply, sufficient, pressure, at, the, right, time, later, in, the, cycle, with, the, primary, piston, this, is, indirect, squeeze, casting, when, no, porosity, is, allowed, in, a, cast, part, then, the, pore, free, casting, process, is, used, it, is, identical, to, the, standard, process, except, oxygen, is, injected, into, the, die, before, each, shot, to, purge, any, air, from, the, mould, cavity, this, causes, small, dispersed, oxides, to, form, when, the, molten, metal, fills, the, die, which, virtually, eliminates, gas, porosity, an, added, advantage, to, this, is, greater, strength, unlike, standard, die, castings, these, castings, can, be, heat, treated, and, welded, this, process, can, be, performed, on, aluminium, zinc, and, lead, alloys, in, vacuum, assisted, high, pressure, die, casting, a, k, a, vacuum, high, pressure, die, casting, vhpdc, a, vacuum, pump, removes, air, and, gases, from, die, cavity, and, metal, delivery, system, before, and, during, injection, vacuum, die, casting, reduces, porosity, allows, heat, treating, and, welding, improves, surface, finish, and, can, increase, strength, heated, manifold, direct, injection, die, casting, also, known, as, direct, injection, die, casting, or, runnerless, die, casting, is, a, zinc, die, casting, process, where, molten, zinc, is, forced, through, a, heated, manifold, and, then, through, heated, mini, nozzles, which, lead, into, the, moulding, cavity, this, process, has, the, advantages, of, lower, cost, per, part, through, the, reduction, of, scrap, by, the, elimination, of, sprues, gates, and, runners, and, energy, conservation, and, better, surface, quality, through, slower, cooling, cycles, semi, solid, die, casting, uses, metal, that, is, heated, between, its, liquidus, and, solidus, or, liquidus, and, eutectic, temperature, so, that, it, is, in, a, mushy, state, this, allows, for, more, complex, parts, and, thinner, walls, low, pressure, die, casting, lpdc, is, a, process, developed, to, improve, the, consistency, and, integrity, of, parts, at, the, cost, of, a, much, slower, cycle, time, in, lpdc, material, is, held, in, a, reservoir, below, the, die, from, which, it, flows, into, the, cavity, when, air, pressure, in, the, reservoir, is, increased, typical, pressures, range, from, 0, 3, bar, 4, 4, psi, to, 0, 5, bar, 7, 3, psi, somewhat, higher, pressures, up, to, 1, bar, 15, psi, may, be, applied, after, the, material, is, in, the, die, to, work, it, into, fine, details, of, the, cavity, and, eliminate, porosity, typical, cycle, times, for, a, low, pressure, die, casting, process, are, longer, than, for, other, die, casting, processes, an, engine, block, can, take, up, to, fifteen, minutes, it, is, primarily, used, for, aluminum, but, has, been, used, for, carbon, steel, as, well, integrated, die, casting, refers, to, the, high, level, integration, of, multiple, separate, and, dispersed, alloy, parts, through, a, large, tonnage, die, casting, machine, and, then, formed, into, 1, 2, large, castings, the, aim, is, to, reduce, manufacturing, costs, through, one, time, molding, significantly, decreasing, the, number, of, parts, needed, for, car, assembly, and, improving, overall, efficiency, elon, musk, s, team, first, proposed, this, processing, method, during, the, tesla, manufacturing, process, which, is, giga, press, program
