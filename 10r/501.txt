an, improvised, explosive, device, ied, is, a, bomb, constructed, and, deployed, in, ways, other, than, in, conventional, military, action, it, may, be, constructed, of, conventional, military, explosives, such, as, an, artillery, shell, attached, to, a, detonating, mechanism, ieds, are, commonly, used, as, roadside, bombs, or, homemade, bombs, the, term, ied, was, coined, by, the, british, army, during, the, northern, ireland, conflict, to, refer, to, booby, traps, made, by, the, ira, and, entered, common, use, in, the, u, s, during, the, iraq, war, ieds, are, generally, utilized, in, terrorist, operations, or, in, asymmetric, unconventional, warfare, or, urban, warfare, by, insurgent, guerrillas, or, commando, forces, in, a, theatre, of, operations, in, the, iraq, war, 2003, 2011, insurgents, used, ieds, extensively, against, u, s, led, forces, and, by, the, end, of, 2007, ieds, were, responsible, for, approximately, 63, of, coalition, deaths, in, iraq, they, were, also, used, in, afghanistan, by, insurgent, groups, and, caused, over, 66, of, coalition, casualties, in, the, 2001, 2021, afghanistan, war, ieds, were, also, used, frequently, by, the, liberation, tigers, of, tamil, eelam, ltte, in, sri, lanka, during, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, and, by, ambazonian, separatists, in, the, ongoing, anglophone, crisis, an, ied, is, a, bomb, fabricated, in, an, improvised, manner, incorporating, destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or, incendiary, chemicals, and, designed, to, destroy, or, incapacitate, personnel, or, vehicles, in, some, cases, ieds, are, used, to, distract, disrupt, or, delay, an, opposing, force, facilitating, another, type, of, attack, ieds, may, incorporate, military, or, commercially, sourced, explosives, and, often, combine, both, types, or, they, may, otherwise, be, made, with, homemade, explosives, hme, an, hme, lab, refers, to, a, homemade, explosive, lab, or, the, physical, location, where, the, devices, are, crafted, an, ied, has, five, components, a, switch, activator, an, initiator, fuse, container, body, charge, explosive, and, a, power, source, battery, an, ied, designed, for, use, against, armoured, targets, such, as, personnel, carriers, or, tanks, will, be, designed, for, armour, penetration, by, using, a, shaped, charge, that, creates, an, explosively, formed, penetrator, ieds, are, extremely, diverse, in, design, and, may, contain, many, types, of, initiators, detonators, penetrators, and, explosive, loads, antipersonnel, ieds, typically, also, contain, fragmentation, generating, objects, such, as, nails, ball, bearings, or, even, small, rocks, to, cause, wounds, at, greater, distances, than, blast, pressure, alone, could, in, the, conflicts, of, the, 21st, century, anti, personnel, improvised, explosive, devices, ied, have, partially, replaced, conventional, or, military, landmines, as, the, source, of, injury, to, dismounted, pedestrian, soldiers, and, civilians, these, injuries, were, reported, in, bmj, open, to, be, far, worse, with, ieds, than, with, landmines, resulting, in, multiple, limb, amputations, and, lower, body, mutilation, this, combination, of, injuries, has, been, given, the, name, dismounted, complex, blast, injury, and, is, thought, to, be, the, worst, survivable, injury, ever, seen, in, war, ieds, are, triggered, by, various, methods, including, remote, control, infrared, or, magnetic, triggers, pressure, sensitive, bars, or, trip, wires, victim, operated, in, some, cases, multiple, ieds, are, wired, together, in, a, daisy, chain, to, attack, a, convoy, of, vehicles, spread, out, along, a, roadway, ieds, made, by, inexperienced, designers, or, with, substandard, materials, may, fail, to, detonate, and, in, some, cases, they, detonate, on, either, the, maker, or, the, placer, of, the, device, some, groups, however, have, been, known, to, produce, sophisticated, devices, constructed, with, components, scavenged, from, conventional, munitions, and, standard, consumer, electronics, components, such, as, mobile, phones, consumer, grade, two, way, radios, washing, machine, timers, pagers, or, garage, door, openers, the, sophistication, of, an, ied, depends, on, the, training, of, the, designer, and, the, tools, and, materials, available, ieds, may, use, artillery, shells, or, conventional, high, explosive, charges, as, their, explosive, load, as, well, as, homemade, explosives, however, the, threat, exists, that, toxic, chemical, biological, or, radioactive, dirty, bomb, material, may, be, added, to, a, device, thereby, creating, other, life, threatening, effects, beyond, the, shrapnel, concussive, blasts, and, fire, normally, associated, with, bombs, chlorine, liquid, has, been, added, to, ieds, in, iraq, producing, clouds, of, chlorine, gas, a, vehicle, borne, ied, or, vbied, is, a, military, term, for, a, car, bomb, or, truck, bomb, but, can, be, any, type, of, transportation, such, as, a, bicycle, motorcycle, donkey, dbied, etc, they, are, typically, employed, by, insurgents, in, particular, isis, and, can, carry, a, relatively, large, payload, they, can, also, be, detonated, from, a, remote, location, vbieds, can, create, additional, shrapnel, through, the, destruction, of, the, vehicle, itself, and, use, vehicle, fuel, as, an, incendiary, weapon, the, act, of, a, person, s, being, in, this, vehicle, and, detonating, it, is, known, as, an, svbied, suicide, of, increasing, popularity, among, insurgent, forces, in, iraq, is, the, house, borne, ied, or, hbied, from, the, common, military, practice, of, clearing, houses, insurgents, rig, an, entire, house, to, detonate, and, collapse, shortly, after, a, clearing, squad, has, entered, the, dictionary, of, military, and, associated, terms, jcs, pub, 1, 02, includes, two, definitions, for, improvised, devices, improvised, explosive, devices, ied, and, improvised, nuclear, device, ind, these, definitions, address, the, nuclear, and, explosive, in, cbrne, that, leaves, chemical, biological, and, radiological, undefined, four, definitions, have, been, created, to, build, on, the, structure, of, the, jcs, definition, terms, have, been, created, to, standardize, the, language, of, first, responders, and, members, of, the, military, and, to, correlate, the, operational, picture, a, device, placed, or, fabricated, in, an, improvised, manner, incorporating, destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or, incendiary, chemicals, and, designed, to, destroy, incapacitate, harass, or, distract, it, may, incorporate, military, stores, but, is, normally, devised, from, non, military, components, ieds, have, been, deployed, in, the, form, of, explosively, formed, projectiles, efp, a, special, type, of, shaped, charge, that, is, effective, at, long, standoffs, from, the, target, 50, meters, or, more, however, they, are, not, accurate, at, long, distances, this, is, because, of, how, they, are, produced, the, large, slug, projected, from, the, explosion, has, no, stabilization, because, it, has, no, tail, fins, and, it, does, not, spin, like, a, bullet, from, a, rifle, without, this, stabilization, the, trajectory, can, not, be, accurately, determined, beyond, 50, meters, an, efp, is, essentially, a, cylindrical, shaped, charge, with, a, machined, concave, metal, disc, often, copper, in, front, pointed, inward, the, force, of, the, shaped, charge, turns, the, disc, into, a, high, velocity, slug, capable, of, penetrating, the, armor, of, most, vehicles, in, iraq, directionally, focused, charges, also, known, as, directionally, focused, fragmentary, charges, depending, on, the, construction, are, very, similar, to, efps, with, the, main, difference, being, that, the, top, plate, is, usually, flat, and, not, concave, it, also, is, not, made, with, machined, copper, but, much, cheaper, cast, or, cut, metal, when, made, for, fragmentation, the, contents, of, the, charge, are, usually, nuts, bolts, ball, bearings, and, other, similar, shrapnel, products, and, explosive, if, it, only, consists, of, the, flat, metal, plate, it, is, known, as, a, platter, charge, serving, a, similar, role, as, an, efp, with, reduced, effect, but, easier, construction, a, device, incorporating, the, toxic, attributes, of, chemical, materials, designed, to, result, in, the, dispersal, of, toxic, chemical, materials, for, the, purpose, of, creating, a, primary, patho, physiological, toxic, effect, morbidity, and, mortality, or, secondary, psychological, effect, causing, fear, and, behavior, modification, on, a, larger, population, such, devices, may, be, fabricated, in, a, completely, improvised, manner, or, may, be, an, improvised, modification, to, an, existing, weapon, a, device, incorporating, biological, materials, designed, to, result, in, the, dispersal, of, vector, borne, biological, material, for, the, purpose, of, creating, a, primary, patho, physiological, toxic, effect, morbidity, and, mortality, or, secondary, psychological, effect, causing, fear, and, behavior, modification, on, a, larger, population, a, device, making, use, of, exothermic, chemical, reactions, designed, to, result, in, the, rapid, spread, of, fire, for, the, purpose, of, creating, a, primary, patho, physiological, effect, morbidity, and, mortality, or, secondary, psychological, effect, causing, fear, and, behavior, modification, on, a, larger, population, or, it, may, be, used, with, the, intent, of, gaining, a, tactical, advantage, such, devices, may, be, fabricated, in, a, completely, improvised, manner, or, may, be, an, improvised, modification, to, an, existing, weapon, a, common, type, of, this, is, the, molotov, cocktail, a, speculative, device, incorporating, radioactive, materials, designed, to, result, in, the, dispersal, of, radioactive, material, for, the, purpose, of, area, denial, and, economic, damage, and, or, for, the, purpose, of, creating, a, primary, patho, physiological, toxic, effect, morbidity, and, mortality, or, secondary, psychological, effect, causing, fear, and, behavior, modification, on, a, larger, population, such, devices, may, be, fabricated, in, a, completely, improvised, manner, or, may, be, an, improvised, modification, to, an, existing, nuclear, weapon, also, called, a, radiological, dispersion, device, rdd, or, dirty, bomb, improvised, nuclear, device, of, most, likely, gun, type, or, implosion, type, a, vehicle, may, be, laden, with, explosives, set, to, explode, by, remote, control, or, by, a, passenger, driver, commonly, known, as, a, car, bomb, or, vehicle, borne, ied, vbied, pronounced, vee, bid, on, occasion, the, driver, of, the, car, bomb, may, have, been, coerced, into, delivery, of, the, vehicle, under, duress, a, situation, known, as, a, proxy, bomb, distinguishing, features, are, low, riding, vehicles, with, excessive, weight, vehicles, with, only, one, passenger, and, ones, where, the, interior, of, the, vehicles, look, as, if, they, have, been, stripped, down, and, built, back, up, car, bombs, can, carry, thousands, of, pounds, of, explosives, and, may, be, augmented, with, shrapnel, to, increase, fragmentation, isis, has, used, truck, bombs, with, devastating, effects, water, borne, improvised, explosive, devices, wbied, i, e, boats, carrying, explosives, can, be, used, against, ships, and, areas, connected, to, water, an, early, example, of, this, type, was, the, japanese, shinyo, suicide, boats, during, world, war, ii, the, boats, were, filled, with, explosives, and, attempted, to, ram, allied, ships, sometimes, successfully, having, sunk, or, severely, damaged, several, american, ships, by, war, s, end, suicide, bombers, used, a, boat, borne, ied, to, attack, the, uss, cole, us, and, uk, troops, have, also, been, killed, by, boat, borne, ieds, in, iraq, the, tamil, tigers, sea, tigers, have, also, been, known, to, use, swbieds, during, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, wbieds, have, been, used, in, the, red, sea, monkeys, and, war, pigs, were, used, as, incendiaries, around, 1000, ad, more, famously, the, anti, tank, dog, and, bat, bomb, were, developed, during, world, war, ii, in, recent, times, a, two, year, old, child, and, seven, other, people, were, killed, by, explosives, strapped, to, a, horse, in, the, town, of, chita, in, colombia, the, carcasses, of, certain, animals, were, also, used, to, conceal, explosive, devices, by, the, iraqi, insurgency, ieds, strapped, to, the, necks, of, farmers, have, been, used, on, at, least, three, occasions, by, guerrillas, in, colombia, as, a, way, of, extortion, american, pizza, delivery, man, brian, douglas, wells, was, killed, in, 2003, by, an, explosive, fastened, to, his, neck, purportedly, under, duress, from, the, maker, of, the, bomb, in, 2011, a, schoolgirl, in, sydney, australia, had, a, suspected, collar, bomb, attached, to, her, by, an, attacker, in, her, home, the, device, was, removed, by, police, after, a, ten, hour, operation, and, proved, to, be, a, hoax, suicide, bombing, usually, refers, to, an, individual, wearing, explosives, and, detonating, them, to, kill, others, including, themselves, the, bomber, will, conceal, explosives, on, and, around, their, person, commonly, using, a, vest, and, will, use, a, timer, or, some, other, trigger, to, detonate, the, explosives, the, logic, behind, such, attacks, is, the, belief, that, an, ied, delivered, by, a, human, has, a, greater, chance, of, achieving, success, than, any, other, method, of, attack, in, addition, there, is, the, psychological, impact, of, child, soldiers, prepared, to, deliberately, sacrifice, themselves, for, their, cause, in, may, 2012, american, counter, terrorism, officials, leaked, their, acquisition, of, documents, describing, the, preparation, and, use, of, surgically, implanted, improvised, explosive, devices, the, devices, were, designed, to, evade, detection, the, devices, were, described, as, containing, no, metal, so, they, could, not, be, detected, by, x, rays, security, officials, referred, to, bombs, being, surgically, implanted, into, suicide, bombers, love, handles, according, to, the, daily, mirror, uk, security, officials, at, mi, 6, asserted, that, female, bombers, could, travel, undetected, carrying, the, explosive, chemicals, in, otherwise, standard, breast, implants, the, bomber, would, blow, up, the, implanted, explosives, by, injecting, a, chemical, trigger, robots, could, also, be, used, to, carry, explosives, first, such, documented, case, was, during, the, aftermath, of, 2016, shooting, of, dallas, police, officers, when, a, bomb, disposal, robot, was, used, to, deliver, explosives, to, kill, micah, xavier, johnson, who, was, hiding, in, a, place, inaccessible, to, police, snipers, as, well, drones, carrying, explosives, were, used, in, a, suspected, assassination, attempt, against, venezuelan, president, nicol, s, maduro, in, 2018, isis, and, al, nusra, have, used, bombs, detonated, in, tunnels, dug, under, targets, in, 2008, rocket, propelled, ieds, dubbed, improvised, rocket, assisted, munitions, improvised, rocket, assisted, mortars, and, iram, by, the, military, came, to, be, employed, in, numbers, against, u, s, forces, in, iraq, they, have, been, described, as, propane, tanks, packed, with, explosives, and, powered, by, 107, mm, rockets, they, are, similar, to, some, provisional, ira, barrack, buster, mortars, new, types, of, irams, including, volcano, iram, and, elephant, rockets, are, used, during, the, syrian, civil, war, improvised, mortars, have, been, used, by, many, insurgent, groups, including, during, the, civil, war, in, syria, and, boko, haram, insurgency, ira, used, improvised, mortars, called, barrack, busters, improvised, artillery, including, hell, cannons, are, used, by, rebel, forces, during, syrian, civil, war, command, wire, improvised, explosive, devices, cwied, use, an, electrical, firing, cable, that, affords, the, user, complete, control, over, the, device, right, up, until, the, moment, of, initiation, the, trigger, for, a, radio, controlled, improvised, explosive, device, rcied, is, controlled, by, radio, link, the, device, is, constructed, so, that, the, receiver, is, connected, to, an, electrical, firing, circuit, and, the, transmitter, operated, by, the, perpetrator, at, a, distance, a, signal, from, the, transmitter, causes, the, receiver, to, trigger, a, firing, pulse, that, operates, the, switch, usually, the, switch, fires, an, initiator, however, the, output, may, also, be, used, to, remotely, arm, an, explosive, circuit, often, the, transmitter, and, receiver, operate, on, a, matched, coding, system, that, prevents, the, rcied, from, being, initiated, by, spurious, radio, frequency, signals, or, jamming, an, rcied, can, be, triggered, from, any, number, of, different, radio, frequency, based, mechanisms, including, handheld, remote, control, transmitters, car, alarms, wireless, door, bells, cell, phones, pagers, and, portable, two, way, radios, including, those, designed, for, the, uhf, pmr446, frs, and, gmrs, services, a, radio, controlled, ied, rcied, incorporating, a, mobile, phone, that, is, modified, and, connected, to, an, electrical, firing, circuit, mobile, phones, operate, in, the, uhf, band, in, line, of, sight, with, base, transceiver, station, bts, antennae, sites, in, the, common, scenario, receipt, of, a, paging, signal, by, phone, is, sufficient, to, initiate, the, ied, firing, circuit, victim, operated, improvised, explosive, devices, voied, also, known, as, booby, traps, are, designed, to, function, upon, contact, with, a, victim, voied, switches, are, often, well, hidden, from, the, victim, or, disguised, as, innocuous, everyday, objects, they, are, operated, by, means, of, movement, switching, methods, include, tripwire, pressure, mats, spring, loaded, release, push, pull, or, tilt, common, forms, of, voied, include, the, under, vehicle, ied, uvied, improvised, landmines, and, mail, bombs, the, british, accused, iran, and, hezbollah, of, teaching, iraqi, fighters, to, use, infrared, light, beams, to, trigger, ieds, as, the, occupation, forces, became, more, sophisticated, in, interrupting, radio, signals, around, their, convoys, the, insurgents, adapted, their, triggering, methods, in, some, cases, when, a, more, advanced, method, was, disrupted, the, insurgents, regressed, to, using, uninterruptible, means, such, as, hard, wires, from, the, ied, to, detonator, however, this, method, is, much, harder, to, effectively, conceal, it, later, emerged, however, that, these, advanced, ieds, were, actually, old, ira, technology, the, infrared, beam, method, was, perfected, by, the, ira, in, the, early, 1990s, after, it, acquired, the, technology, from, a, botched, undercover, british, army, operation, many, of, the, ieds, being, used, against, the, invading, coalition, forces, in, iraq, were, originally, developed, by, the, british, army, who, unintentionally, passed, the, information, on, to, the, ira, the, ira, taught, their, techniques, to, the, palestine, liberation, organisation, and, the, knowledge, spread, to, iraq, counter, ied, efforts, are, done, primarily, by, military, law, enforcement, diplomatic, financial, and, intelligence, communities, and, involve, a, comprehensive, approach, to, countering, the, threat, networks, that, employ, ieds, not, just, efforts, to, defeat, the, devices, themselves, because, the, components, of, these, devices, are, being, used, in, a, manner, not, intended, by, their, manufacturer, and, because, the, method, of, producing, the, explosion, is, limited, only, by, the, science, and, imagination, of, the, perpetrator, it, is, not, possible, to, follow, a, step, by, step, guide, to, detect, and, disarm, a, device, that, an, individual, has, only, recently, developed, as, such, explosive, ordnance, disposal, iedd, operators, must, be, able, to, fall, back, on, their, extensive, knowledge, of, the, first, principles, of, explosives, and, ammunition, to, try, and, deduce, what, the, perpetrator, has, done, and, only, then, to, render, it, safe, and, dispose, of, or, exploit, the, device, beyond, this, as, the, stakes, increase, and, ieds, are, emplaced, not, only, to, achieve, the, direct, effect, but, to, deliberately, target, iedd, operators, and, cordon, personnel, the, iedd, operator, needs, to, have, a, deep, understanding, of, tactics, to, ensure, they, are, neither, setting, up, any, of, their, team, or, the, cordon, troops, for, an, attack, nor, walking, into, one, themselves, the, presence, of, chemical, biological, radiological, or, nuclear, cbrn, material, in, an, ied, requires, additional, precautions, as, with, other, missions, the, eod, operator, provides, the, area, commander, with, an, assessment, of, the, situation, and, of, support, needed, to, complete, the, mission, military, and, law, enforcement, personnel, from, around, the, world, have, developed, a, number, of, render, safe, procedures, rsps, to, deal, with, ieds, rsps, may, be, developed, as, a, result, of, direct, experience, with, devices, or, by, applied, research, designed, to, counter, the, threat, the, supposed, effectiveness, of, ied, jamming, systems, including, vehicle, and, personally, mounted, systems, has, caused, ied, technology, to, essentially, regress, to, command, wire, detonation, methods, these, are, physical, connections, between, the, detonator, and, explosive, device, and, cannot, be, jammed, however, these, types, of, ieds, are, more, difficult, to, emplace, quickly, and, are, more, readily, detected, military, forces, and, law, enforcement, from, india, canada, united, kingdom, israel, spain, and, the, united, states, are, at, the, forefront, of, counter, ied, efforts, as, all, have, direct, experience, in, dealing, with, ieds, used, against, them, in, conflict, or, terrorist, attacks, from, the, research, and, development, side, programs, such, as, the, new, canadian, unmanned, systems, challenge, will, bring, student, groups, together, to, invent, an, unmanned, device, to, both, locate, ieds, and, pinpoint, the, insurgents, the, fougasse, was, improvised, for, centuries, eventually, inspiring, factory, made, land, mines, ernst, j, nger, mentions, in, his, war, memoir, the, systematic, use, of, ieds, and, booby, traps, to, cover, the, retreat, of, german, troops, at, the, somme, region, during, world, war, i, another, early, example, of, coordinated, large, scale, use, of, ieds, was, the, belarusian, rail, war, launched, by, belarusian, guerrillas, against, the, germans, during, world, war, ii, both, command, detonated, and, delayed, fuse, ieds, were, used, to, derail, thousands, of, german, trains, during, 1943, 1944, starting, six, months, before, the, invasion, of, afghanistan, by, the, ussr, on, 27, december, 1979, the, afghan, mujahideen, were, supplied, by, the, cia, among, others, with, large, quantities, of, military, supplies, among, those, supplies, were, many, types, of, anti, tank, mines, the, insurgents, often, removed, the, explosives, from, several, foreign, anti, tank, mines, and, combined, the, explosives, in, tin, cooking, oil, cans, for, a, more, powerful, blast, by, combining, the, explosives, from, several, mines, and, placing, them, in, tin, cans, the, insurgents, made, them, more, powerful, but, sometimes, also, easier, to, detect, by, soviet, sappers, using, mine, detectors, after, an, ied, was, detonated, the, insurgents, often, used, direct, fire, weapons, such, as, machine, guns, and, rocket, propelled, grenades, to, continue, the, attack, afghan, insurgents, operating, far, from, the, border, with, pakistan, did, not, have, a, ready, supply, of, foreign, anti, tank, mines, they, preferred, to, make, ieds, from, soviet, unexploded, ordnance, the, devices, were, rarely, triggered, by, pressure, fuses, they, were, almost, always, remotely, detonated, since, the, 2001, invasion, of, afghanistan, the, taliban, and, its, supporters, have, used, ieds, against, nato, and, afghan, military, and, civilian, vehicles, this, has, become, the, most, common, method, of, attack, against, nato, forces, with, ied, attacks, increasing, consistently, year, on, year, a, brigade, commander, said, that, sniffer, dogs, are, the, most, reliable, way, of, detecting, ieds, however, statistical, evidence, gathered, by, the, us, army, maneuver, support, center, at, fort, leonard, wood, mo, shows, that, the, dogs, are, not, the, most, effective, means, of, detecting, ieds, the, u, s, army, s, 10th, mountain, division, was, the, first, unit, to, introduce, explosive, detection, dogs, in, southern, afghanistan, in, less, than, two, years, the, dogs, discovered, 15, tons, of, illegal, munitions, ied, s, and, weapons, in, july, 2012, it, was, reported, that, sticky, bombs, magnetically, adhesive, ied, s, that, were, prevalent, in, the, iraq, war, showed, up, in, afghanistan, by, 2021, there, was, at, least, one, sticky, bomb, attack, a, day, in, kabul, they, are, used, in, both, traditional, assassinations, and, targeted, killings, and, as, terror, weapons, against, the, population, at, large, in, november, 2013, one, of, the, largest, ieds, constructed, was, intercepted, near, gardez, city, in, eastern, afghanistan, the, 61, 000, pounds, of, explosives, was, hidden, under, what, appeared, to, be, piles, of, wood, by, comparison, the, truck, bomb, that, all, but, razed, the, alfred, p, murrah, federal, building, in, oklahoma, city, and, killed, 168, people, in, 1995, weighed, less, than, 5, 000, pounds, a, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, officer, assigned, to, the, nearby, fob, lightning, analyzed, the, potential, blast, damage, which, resulted, in, closing, fob, goode, due, to, its, proximity, to, the, highway, isaf, troops, stationed, in, afghanistan, and, other, ied, prone, areas, of, operation, would, commonly, bip, blow, in, place, ied, s, and, other, explosives, that, were, considered, too, dangerous, to, defuse, ieds, are, being, used, by, insurgents, against, government, forces, during, the, insurgency, in, egypt, 2013, present, and, the, sinai, insurgency, ieds,

witnesses, convention, in, kalamassery, india, in, the, 2003, 2011, iraq, war, ieds, have, been, used, extensively, against, coalition, forces, and, by, the, end, of, 2007, they, have, been, responsible, for, at, least, 64, of, coalition, deaths, in, iraq, since, the, detonation, of, the, first, ied, in, iraq, in, 2003, more, than, 81, 000, ied, attacks, have, occurred, in, the, country, killing, and, wounding, 21, 200, americans, beginning, in, july, 2003, the, iraqi, insurgency, used, ieds, to, target, invading, coalition, vehicles, according, to, the, washington, post, 64, of, u, s, deaths, in, iraq, occurred, due, to, ieds, a, french, study, showed, that, in, iraq, from, march, 2003, to, november, 2006, on, a, global, 3, 070, deaths, in, the, us, led, invading, coalition, soldiers, 1, 257, were, caused, by, ieds, i, e, 41, that, is, to, say, more, than, in, the, normal, fights, 1027, dead, 34, insurgents, now, use, the, bombs, to, target, not, only, invading, coalition, vehicles, but, iraqi, police, as, well, common, locations, for, placing, these, bombs, on, the, ground, include, animal, carcasses, soft, drink, cans, and, boxes, typically, they, explode, underneath, or, to, the, side, of, the, vehicle, to, cause, the, maximum, amount, of, damage, however, as, vehicle, armour, was, improved, on, military, vehicles, insurgents, began, placing, ieds, in, elevated, positions, such, as, on, road, signs, utility, poles, or, trees, to, hit, less, protected, areas, ieds, in, iraq, may, be, made, with, artillery, or, mortar, shells, or, with, varying, amounts, of, bulk, or, homemade, explosives, early, during, the, iraq, war, the, bulk, explosives, were, often, obtained, from, stored, munitions, bunkers, to, include, stripping, landmines, of, their, explosives, despite, the, increased, armor, ieds, are, killing, military, personnel, and, civilians, with, greater, frequency, may, 2007, was, the, deadliest, month, for, ied, attacks, thus, far, with, a, reported, 89, of, the, 129, invading, coalition, casualties, coming, from, an, ied, attack, according, to, the, pentagon, 250, 000, tons, out, of, 650, 000, tons, total, of, iraqi, heavy, ordnance, were, looted, providing, a, large, supply, of, ammunition, for, the, insurgents, in, october, 2005, the, uk, government, charged, that, iran, was, supplying, insurgents, with, the, technological, know, how, to, make, shaped, charge, ieds, both, iranian, and, iraqi, government, officials, denied, the, allegations, during, the, iraqi, civil, war, 2014, 2017, isil, has, made, extensive, use, of, suicide, vbieds, often, driven, by, children, elderly, and, disabled, on, august, 27, 2023, israeli, security, forces, successfully, foiled, an, attempt, to, smuggle, iranian, made, explosives, into, israel, from, jordan, the, thwarted, smuggling, operation, in, the, jordan, valley, aimed, to, supply, terror, groups, in, the, west, bank, with, explosives, counter, smuggling, efforts, along, the, border, have, led, to, increased, seizures, of, weapons, and, explosive, devices, from, 1912, 1913, the, suffragettes, utilised, ieds, in, the, suffragette, bombing, and, arson, campaign, throughout, the, troubles, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, made, extensive, use, of, ieds, in, their, 1969, 97, campaign, much, of, which, were, made, in, the, republic, of, ireland, they, used, barrack, buster, mortars, and, remote, controlled, ieds, members, of, the, ira, developed, and, counter, developed, devices, and, tactics, ira, bombs, became, highly, sophisticated, featuring, anti, handling, devices, such, as, a, mercury, tilt, switch, or, microswitches, these, devices, would, detonate, the, bomb, if, it, was, moved, in, any, way, typically, the, safety, arming, device, used, was, a, clockwork, memopark, timer, which, armed, the, bomb, up, to, 60, minutes, after, it, was, placed, by, completing, an, electrical, circuit, supplying, power, to, the, anti, handling, device, depending, on, the, particular, design, e, g, boobytrapped, briefcase, or, car, bomb, an, independent, electrical, circuit, supplied, power, to, a, conventional, timer, set, for, the, intended, time, delay, e, g, 40, minutes, however, some, electronic, delays, developed, by, ira, technicians, could, be, set, to, accurately, detonate, a, bomb, weeks, after, it, was, hidden, which, is, what, happened, in, the, brighton, hotel, bomb, attack, of, 1984, initially, bombs, were, detonated, either, by, timer, or, by, simple, command, wire, later, bombs, could, be, detonated, by, radio, control, initially, simple, servos, from, radio, controlled, aircraft, were, used, to, close, the, electrical, circuit, and, supply, power, to, the, detonator, after, the, british, developed, jammers, ira, technicians, introduced, devices, that, required, a, sequence, of, pulsed, radio, codes, to, arm, and, detonate, them, these, were, harder, to, jam, the, ira, as, well, as, ulster, loyalist, paramilitaries, have, also, utilized, less, sophisticated, devices, such, as, homemade, grenades, crudely, thrown, at, the, target, these, are, sometimes, called, blast, bombs, roadside, bombs, were, extensively, used, by, the, ira, typically, a, roadside, bomb, was, placed, in, a, drain, or, culvert, along, a, rural, road, and, detonated, by, remote, control, when, british, security, forces, vehicles, were, passing, as, with, the, case, of, the, 1979, warrenpoint, ambush, as, a, result, of, the, use, of, these, bombs, the, british, military, stopped, transport, by, road, in, areas, such, as, south, armagh, and, used, helicopter, transport, instead, to, avoid, the, danger, most, ieds, used, commercial, or, homemade, explosives, made, in, the, republic, of, ireland, with, ingredients, such, as, gelignite, and, anfo, either, stolen, in, construction, sites, or, provided, for, by, supporters, in, the, south, although, the, use, of, semtex, h, smuggled, in, from, libya, in, the, 1980s, was, also, common, from, the, mid, 1980s, onward, bomb, disposal, teams, from, 321, eod, manned, by, ammunition, technicians, were, deployed, in, those, areas, to, deal, with, the, ied, threat, the, ira, also, used, secondary, devices, to, catch, british, reinforcements, sent, in, after, an, initial, blast, as, occurred, in, the, warrenpoint, ambush, between, 1970, and, 2005, the, ira, detonated, 19, 000, ieds, in, the, northern, ireland, and, britain, an, average, of, one, every, 17, hours, for, three, and, a, half, decades, arguably, making, it, the, biggest, terrorist, bombing, campaign, in, history, in, the, early, 1970s, at, the, height, of, the, ira, campaign, the, british, army, unit, tasked, with, rendering, safe, ieds, 321, eod, sustained, significant, casualties, while, engaged, in, bomb, disposal, operations, this, mortality, rate, was, far, higher, than, other, high, risk, occupations, such, as, deep, sea, diving, and, a, careful, review, was, made, of, how, men, were, selected, for, eod, operations, the, review, recommended, bringing, in, psychometric, testing, of, soldiers, to, ensure, those, chosen, had, the, correct, mental, preparation, for, high, risk, bomb, disposal, duties, the, ira, came, up, with, ever, more, sophisticated, designs, and, deployments, of, ieds, booby, trap, or, victim, operated, ieds, voieds, became, commonplace, the, ira, engaged, in, an, ongoing, battle, to, gain, the, upper, hand, in, electronic, warfare, with, remote, controlled, devices, the, rapid, changes, in, development, led, 321, eod, to, employ, specialists, from, dera, now, dstl, an, agency, of, the, mod, the, royal, signals, and, military, intelligence, this, approach, by, the, british, army, to, fighting, the, ira, in, northern, ireland, led, to, the, development, and, use, of, most, of, the, modern, weapons, equipment, and, techniques, now, used, by, eod, operators, throughout, the, rest, of, the, world, today, the, bomb, disposal, operations, were, led, by, ammunition, technicians, and, ammunition, technical, officers, from, 321, eod, and, were, trained, at, the, felix, centre, at, the, army, school, of, ammunition, ieds, have, been, used, in, many, attacks, by, palestinian, militants, and, continue, to, be, used, in, recent, attacks, the, lebanese, national, resistance, front, the, popular, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, other, resistance, groups, in, lebanon, and, later, hezbollah, made, extensive, use, of, ieds, to, resist, israeli, forces, after, israel, s, invasion, of, lebanon, in, 1982, israel, withdrew, from, beirut, northern, lebanon, and, mount, lebanon, in, 1985, whilst, maintaining, its, occupation, of, southern, lebanon, hezbollah, frequently, used, ieds, to, attack, israeli, military, forces, in, this, area, up, until, the, israeli, withdrawal, and, the, end, of, the, invasion, of, lebanon, in, may, 2000, one, such, bomb, killed, israeli,

used, extensively, during, the, post, civil, war, violence, in, libya, mostly, in, the, city, of, benghazi, against, police, stations, cars, or, foreign, embassies, ieds, were, also, widely, used, in, the, 10, years, long, civil, war, of, the, maoists, in, nepal, ranging, from, those, bought, from, illicit, groups, in, india, and, china, to, self, made, devices, typically, used, devices, were, pressure, cooker, bombs, socket, bombs, pipe, bombs, bucket, bombs, etc, the, devices, were, used, more, for, the, act, of, terrorizing, the, urban, population, rather, than, for, fatal, causes, placed, in, front, of, governmental, offices, street, corners, or, road, sides, mainly, the, home, made, ieds, were, responsible, for, destruction, of, majority, of, structures, targeted, by, the,

police, military, security, forces, and, civilian, targets, ieds, have, also, been, popular, in, chechnya, where, russian, forces, were, engaged, in, fighting, with, rebel, elements, while, no, concrete, statistics, are, available, on, this, matter, bombs, have, accounted, for, many, russian, deaths, in, both, the, first, chechen, war, 1994, 1996, and, the, second, 1999, 2009, al, shabaab, is, using, ieds, during, the, somali, civil, war, during, the, syrian, civil, war, militant, insurgents, were, using, ieds, to, attack, buses, cars, trucks, tanks, and, military, convoys, additionally, the, syrian, air, force, has, used, barrel, bombs, to, attack, targets, in, cities, and, other, areas, such, barrel, bombs, consist, of, barrels, filled, with, high, explosives, oil,
