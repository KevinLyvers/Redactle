a, waveguide, is, a, structure, that, guides, waves, by, restricting, the, transmission, of, energy, to, one, direction, common, types, of, waveguides, include, acoustic, waveguides, which, direct, sound, optical, waveguides, which, direct, light, and, radio, frequency, waveguides, which, direct, electromagnetic, waves, other, than, light, like, radio, waves, without, the, physical, constraint, of, a, waveguide, waves, would, expand, into, three, dimensional, space, and, their, intensities, would, decrease, according, to, the, inverse, square, law, there, are, different, types, of, waveguides, for, different, types, of, waves, the, original, and, most, common, meaning, is, a, hollow, conductive, metal, pipe, used, to, carry, high, frequency, radio, waves, particularly, microwaves, dielectric, waveguides, are, used, at, higher, radio, frequencies, and, transparent, dielectric, waveguides, and, optical, fibers, serve, as, waveguides, for, light, in, acoustics, air, ducts, and, horns, are, used, as, waveguides, for, sound, in, musical, instruments, and, loudspeakers, and, specially, shaped, metal, rods, conduct, ultrasonic, waves, in, ultrasonic, machining, the, geometry, of, a, waveguide, reflects, its, function, in, addition, to, more, common, types, that, channel, the, wave, in, one, dimension, there, are, two, dimensional, slab, waveguides, which, confine, waves, to, two, dimensions, the, frequency, of, the, transmitted, wave, also, dictates, the, size, of, a, waveguide, each, waveguide, has, a, cutoff, wavelength, determined, by, its, size, and, will, not, conduct, waves, of, greater, wavelength, an, optical, fiber, that, guides, light, will, not, transmit, microwaves, which, have, a, much, larger, wavelength, some, naturally, occurring, structures, can, also, act, as, waveguides, the, sofar, channel, layer, in, the, ocean, can, guide, the, sound, of, whale, song, across, enormous, distances, any, shape, of, cross, section, of, waveguide, can, support, em, waves, irregular, shapes, are, difficult, to, analyse, commonly, used, waveguides, are, rectangular, and, circular, in, shape, the, uses, of, waveguides, for, transmitting, signals, were, known, even, before, the, term, was, coined, the, phenomenon, of, sound, waves, guided, through, a, taut, wire, have, been, known, for, a, long, time, as, well, as, sound, through, a, hollow, pipe, such, as, a, cave, or, medical, stethoscope, other, uses, of, waveguides, are, in, transmitting, power, between, the, components, of, a, system, such, as, radio, radar, or, optical, devices, waveguides, are, the, fundamental, principle, of, guided, wave, testing, gwt, one, of, the, many, methods, of, non, destructive, evaluation, specific, examples, the, first, structure, for, guiding, waves, was, proposed, by, j, j, thomson, in, 1893, and, was, first, experimentally, tested, by, oliver, lodge, in, 1894, the, first, mathematical, analysis, of, electromagnetic, waves, in, a, metal, cylinder, was, performed, by, lord, rayleigh, in, 1897, 8, for, sound, waves, lord, rayleigh, published, a, full, mathematical, analysis, of, propagation, modes, in, his, seminal, work, the, theory, of, sound, jagadish, chandra, bose, researched, millimeter, wavelengths, using, waveguides, and, in, 1897, described, to, the, royal, institution, in, london, his, research, carried, out, in, kolkata, the, study, of, dielectric, waveguides, such, as, optical, fibers, see, below, began, as, early, as, the, 1920s, by, several, people, most, famous, of, which, are, rayleigh, sommerfeld, and, debye, optical, fiber, began, to, receive, special, attention, in, the, 1960s, due, to, its, importance, to, the, communications, industry, the, development, of, radio, communication, initially, occurred, at, the, lower, frequencies, because, these, could, be, more, easily, propagated, over, large, distances, the, long, wavelengths, made, these, frequencies, unsuitable, for, use, in, hollow, metal, waveguides, because, of, the, impractically, large, diameter, tubes, required, consequently, research, into, hollow, metal, waveguides, stalled, and, the, work, of, lord, rayleigh, was, forgotten, for, a, time, and, had, to, be, rediscovered, by, others, practical, investigations, resumed, in, the, 1930s, by, george, c, southworth, at, bell, labs, and, wilmer, l, barrow, at, mit, southworth, at, first, took, the, theory, from, papers, on, waves, in, dielectric, rods, because, the, work, of, lord, rayleigh, was, unknown, to, him, this, misled, him, somewhat, some, of, his, experiments, failed, because, he, was, not, aware, of, the, phenomenon, of, waveguide, cutoff, frequency, already, found, in, lord, rayleigh, s, work, serious, theoretical, work, was, taken, up, by, john, r, carson, and, sallie, p, mead, this, work, led, to, the, discovery, that, for, the, te, 01, mode, in, circular, waveguide, losses, go, down, with, frequency, and, at, one, time, this, was, a, serious, contender, for, the, format, for, long, distance, telecommunications, 544, 548, the, importance, of, radar, in, world, war, ii, gave, a, great, impetus, to, waveguide, research, at, least, on, the, allied, side, the, magnetron, developed, in, 1940, by, john, randall, and, harry, boot, at, the, university, of, birmingham, in, the, united, kingdom, provided, a, good, power, source, and, made, microwave, radar, feasible, the, most, important, centre, of, us, research, was, at, the, radiation, laboratory, rad, lab, at, mit, but, many, others, took, part, in, the, us, and, in, the, uk, such, as, the, telecommunications, research, establishment, the, head, of, the, fundamental, development, group, at, rad, lab, was, edward, mills, purcell, his, researchers, included, julian, schwinger, nathan, marcuvitz, carol, gray, montgomery, and, robert, h, dicke, much, of, the, rad, lab, work, concentrated, on, finding, lumped, element, models, of, waveguide, structures, so, that, components, in, waveguide, could, be, analysed, with, standard, circuit, theory, hans, bethe, was, also, briefly, at, rad, lab, but, while, there, he, produced, his, small, aperture, theory, which, proved, important, for, waveguide, cavity, filters, first, developed, at, rad, lab, the, german, side, on, the, other, hand, largely, ignored, the, potential, of, waveguides, in, radar, until, very, late, in, the, war, so, much, so, that, when, radar, parts, from, a, downed, british, plane, were, sent, to, siemens, halske, for, analysis, even, though, they, were, recognised, as, microwave, components, their, purpose, could, not, be, identified, at, that, time, microwave, techniques, were, badly, neglected, in, germany, it, was, generally, believed, that, it, was, of, no, use, for, electronic, warfare, and, those, who, wanted, to, do, research, work, in, this, field, were, not, allowed, to, do, so, german, academics, were, even, allowed, to, continue, publicly, publishing, their, research, in, this, field, because, it, was, not, felt, to, be, important, 548, 554, 1055, 1057, immediately, after, world, war, ii, waveguide, was, the, technology, of, choice, in, the, microwave, field, however, it, has, some, problems, it, is, bulky, expensive, to, produce, and, the, cutoff, frequency, effect, makes, it, difficult, to, produce, wideband, devices, ridged, waveguide, can, increase, bandwidth, beyond, an, octave, but, a, better, solution, is, to, use, a, technology, working, in, tem, mode, that, is, non, waveguide, such, as, coaxial, conductors, since, tem, does, not, have, a, cutoff, frequency, a, shielded, rectangular, conductor, can, also, be, used, and, this, has, certain, manufacturing, advantages, over, coax, and, can, be, seen, as, the, forerunner, of, the, planar, technologies, stripline, and, microstrip, however, planar, technologies, really, started, to, take, off, when, printed, circuits, were, introduced, these, methods, are, significantly, cheaper, than, waveguide, and, have, largely, taken, its, place, in, most, bands, however, waveguide, is, still, favoured, in, the, higher, microwave, bands, from, around, ku, band, upwards, 556, 557, 21, 27, 21, 50, a, propagation, mode, in, a, waveguide, is, one, solution, of, the, wave, equations, or, in, other, words, the, form, of, the, wave, due, to, the, constraints, of, the, boundary, conditions, there, are, only, limited, frequencies, and, forms, for, the, wave, function, which, can, propagate, in, the, waveguide, the, lowest, frequency, in, which, a, certain, mode, can, propagate, is, the, cutoff, frequency, of, that, mode, the, mode, with, the, lowest, cutoff, frequency, is, the, fundamental, mode, of, the, waveguide, and, its, cutoff, frequency, is, the, waveguide, cutoff, frequency, 38, propagation, modes, are, computed, by, solving, the, helmholtz, equation, alongside, a, set, of, boundary, conditions, depending, on, the, geometrical, shape, and, materials, bounding, the, region, the, usual, assumption, for, infinitely, long, uniform, waveguides, allows, us, to, assume, a, propagating, form, for, the, wave, i, e, stating, that, every, field, component, has, a, known, dependency, on, the, propagation, direction, i, e, z, displaystyle, z, more, specifically, the, common, approach, is, to, first, replace, all, unknown, time, varying, fields, u, x, y, z, t, displaystyle, u, x, y, z, t, assuming, for, simplicity, to, describe, the, fields, in, cartesian, components, with, their, complex, phasors, representation, u, x, y, z, displaystyle, u, x, y, z, sufficient, to, fully, describe, any, infinitely, long, single, tone, signal, at, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, angular, frequency, 2, f, displaystyle, omega, 2, pi, f, and, rewrite, the, helmholtz, equation, and, boundary, conditions, accordingly, then, every, unknown, field, is, forced, to, have, a, form, like, u, x, y, z, u, x, y, e, z, displaystyle, u, x, y, z, hat, u, x, y, e, gamma, z, where, the, displaystyle, gamma, term, represents, the, propagation, constant, still, unknown, along, the, direction, along, which, the, waveguide, extends, to, infinity, the, helmholtz, equation, can, be, rewritten, to, accommodate, such, form, and, the, resulting, equality, needs, to, be, solved, for, displaystyle, gamma, and, u, x, y, displaystyle, hat, u, x, y, yielding, in, the, end, an, eigenvalue, equation, for, displaystyle, gamma, and, a, corresponding, eigenfunction, u, x, y, displaystyle, hat, u, x, y, gamma, for, each, solution, of, the, former, the, propagation, constant, displaystyle, gamma, of, the, guided, wave, is, complex, in, general, for, a, lossless, case, the, propagation, constant, might, be, found, to, take, on, either, real, or, imaginary, values, depending, on, the, chosen, solution, of, the, eigenvalue, equation, and, on, the, angular, frequency, displaystyle, omega, when, displaystyle, gamma, is, purely, real, the, mode, is, said, to, be, below, cutoff, since, the, amplitude, of, the, field, phasors, tends, to, exponentially, decrease, with, propagation, an, imaginary, displaystyle, gamma, instead, represents, modes, said, to, be, in, propagation, or, above, cutoff, as, the, complex, amplitude, of, the, phasors, does, not, change, with, z, displaystyle, z, in, circuit, theory, the, impedance, is, a, generalization, of, electrical, resistance, in, the, case, of, alternating, current, and, is, measured, in, ohms, displaystyle, omega, a, waveguide, in, circuit, theory, is, described, by, a, transmission, line, having, a, length, and, characteristic, impedance, 2, 3, 6, 12, 14, in, other, words, the, impedance, indicates, the, ratio, of, voltage, to, current, of, the, circuit, component, in, this, case, a, waveguide, during, propagation, of, the, wave, this, description, of, the, waveguide, was, originally, intended, for, alternating, current, but, is, also, suitable, for, electromagnetic, and, sound, waves, once, the, wave, and, material, properties, such, as, pressure, density, dielectric, constant, are, properly, converted, into, electrical, terms, current, and, impedance, for, example, 14, impedance, matching, is, important, when, components, of, an, electric, circuit, are, connected, waveguide, to, antenna, for, example, the, impedance, ratio, determines, how, much, of, the, wave, is, transmitted, forward, and, how, much, is, reflected, in, connecting, a, waveguide, to, an, antenna, a, complete, transmission, is, usually, required, so, an, effort, is, made, to, match, their, impedances, the, reflection, coefficient, can, be, calculated, using, z, 2, z, 1, z, 2, z, 1, displaystyle, gamma, frac, z, 2, z, 1, z, 2, z, 1, where, displaystyle, gamma, gamma, is, the, reflection, coefficient, 0, denotes, full, transmission, 1, full, reflection, and, 0, 5, is, a, reflection, of, half, the, incoming, voltage, z, 1, displaystyle, z, 1, and, z, 2, displaystyle, z, 2, are, the, impedance, of, the, first, component, from, which, the, wave, enters, and, the, second, component, respectively, an, impedance, mismatch, creates, a, reflected, wave, which, added, to, the, incoming, waves, creates, a, standing, wave, an, impedance, mismatch, can, be, also, quantified, with, the, standing, wave, ratio, swr, or, vswr, for, voltage, which, is, connected, to, the, impedance, ratio, and, reflection, coefficient, by, v, s, w, r, v, m, a, x, v, m, i, n, 1, 1, displaystyle, mathrm, vswr, frac, v, rm, max, v, rm, min, frac, 1, gamma, 1, gamma, where, v, m, i, n, m, a, x, displaystyle, left, v, right, rm, min, max, are, the, minimum, and, maximum, values, of, the, voltage, absolute, value, and, the, vswr, is, the, voltage, standing, wave, ratio, which, value, of, 1, denotes, full, transmission, without, reflection, and, thus, no, standing, wave, while, very, large, values, mean, high, reflection, and, standing, wave, pattern, waveguides, can, be, constructed, to, carry, waves, over, a, wide, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, but, are, especially, useful, in, the, microwave, and, optical, frequency, ranges, depending, on, the, frequency, they, can, be, constructed, from, either, conductive, or, dielectric, materials, waveguides, are, used, for, transferring, both, power, and, communication, signals, 1, 3, xiii, xiv, waveguides, used, at, optical, frequencies, are, typically, dielectric, waveguides, structures, in, which, a, dielectric, material, with, high, permittivity, and, thus, high, index, of, refraction, is, surrounded, by, a, material, with, lower, permittivity, the, structure, guides, optical, waves, by, total, internal, reflection, an, example, of, an, optical, waveguide, is, optical, fiber, other, types, of, optical, waveguide, are, also, used, including, photonic, crystal, fiber, which, guides, waves, by, any, of, several, distinct, mechanisms, guides, in, the, form, of, a, hollow, tube, with, a, highly, reflective, inner, surface, have, also, been, used, as, light, pipes, for, illumination, applications, the, inner, surfaces, may, be, polished, metal, or, may, be, covered, with, a, multilayer, film, that, guides, light, by, bragg, reflection, this, is, a, special, case, of, a, photonic, crystal, fiber, one, can, also, use, small, prisms, around, the, pipe, which, reflect, light, via, total, internal, reflection, such, confinement, is, necessarily, imperfect, however, since, total, internal, reflection, can, never, truly, guide, light, within, a, lower, index, core, in, the, prism, case, some, light, leaks, out, at, the, prism, corners, an, acoustic, waveguide, is, a, physical, structure, for, guiding, sound, waves, sound, in, an, acoustic, waveguide, behaves, like, electromagnetic, waves, on, a, transmission, line, waves, on, a, string, like, the, ones, in, a, tin, can, telephone, are, a, simple, example, of, an, acoustic, waveguide, another, example, are, pressure, waves, in, the, pipes, of, an, organ, the, term, acoustic, waveguide, is, also, used, to, describe, elastic, waves, guided, in, micro, scale, devices, like, those, employed, in, piezoelectric, delay, lines, and, in, stimulated, brillouin, scattering, waveguides, are, interesting, objects, of, study, from, a, strictly, mathematical, perspective, a, waveguide, or, tube, is, defined, as, type, of, boundary, condition, on, the, wave, equation, such, that, the, wave, function, must, be, equal, to, zero, on, the, boundary, and, that, the, allowed, region, is, finite, in, all, dimensions, but, one, an, infinitely, long, cylinder, is, an, example, a, large, number, of, interesting, results, can, be, proven, from, these, general, conditions, it, turns, out, that, any, tube, with, a, bulge, where, the, width, of, the, tube, increases, admits, at, least, one, bound, state, that, exist, inside, the, mode, gaps, the, frequencies, of, all, the, bound, states, can, be, identified, by, using, a, pulse, short, in, time, this, can, be, shown, using, the, variational, principles, an, interesting, result, by, jeffrey, goldstone, and, robert, jaffe, is, that, any, tube, of, constant, width, with, a, twist, admits, a, bound, state, sound, synthesis, uses, digital, delay, lines, as, computational, elements, to, simulate, wave, propagation, in, tubes, of, wind, instruments, and, the, vibrating, strings, of, string, instruments
