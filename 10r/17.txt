https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo
a, silo, from, ancient, greek, sir, s, pit, for, holding, grain, is, a, structure, for, storing, bulk, materials, silos, are, commonly, used, for, bulk, storage, of, grain, coal, cement, carbon, black, woodchips, food, products, and, sawdust, three, types, of, silos, are, in, widespread, use, today, tower, silos, bunker, silos, and, bag, silos, silos, are, used, in, agriculture, to, store, fermented, feed, known, as, silage, storage, silos, are, cylindrical, structures, typically, 10, to, 90, ft, 3, to, 27, m, in, diameter, and, 30, to, 275, ft, 10, to, 90, m, in, height, with, the, slipform, and, jumpform, concrete, silos, being, the, larger, diameter, and, taller, silos, they, can, be, made, of, many, materials, wood, staves, concrete, staves, cast, concrete, and, steel, panels, have, all, been, used, and, have, varying, cost, durability, and, airtightness, tradeoffs, silos, storing, grain, cement, and, woodchips, are, typically, unloaded, with, air, slides, or, augers, silos, can, be, unloaded, into, rail, cars, trucks, or, conveyors, tower, silos, containing, silage, are, usually, unloaded, from, the, top, of, the, pile, originally, by, hand, using, a, silage, fork, which, has, many, more, tines, than, the, common, pitchfork, 12, vs, 4, and, in, modern, times, using, mechanical, unloaders, bottom, silo, unloaders, are, utilized, at, times, but, have, problems, with, difficulty, of, repair, an, advantage, of, tower, silos, is, that, the, silage, tends, to, pack, well, due, to, its, own, weight, except, in, the, top, few, feet, however, this, may, be, a, disadvantage, for, items, like, chopped, wood, the, tower, silo, was, invented, by, franklin, hiram, king, in, canada, australia, and, the, united, states, many, country, towns, or, the, larger, farmers, in, grain, growing, areas, have, groups, of, wooden, or, concrete, tower, silos, known, as, grain, elevators, to, collect, grain, from, the, surrounding, towns, and, store, and, protect, the, grain, for, transport, by, train, truck, or, barge, to, a, processor, or, to, an, export, port, in, bumper, crop, times, the, excess, grain, is, stored, in, piles, without, silos, or, bins, causing, considerable, losses, concrete, stave, silos, are, constructed, from, small, precast, concrete, blocks, with, ridged, grooves, along, each, edge, that, lock, them, together, into, a, high, strength, shell, concrete, is, much, stronger, in, compression, than, tension, so, the, silo, is, reinforced, with, steel, hoops, encircling, the, tower, and, compressing, the, staves, into, a, tight, ring, the, vertical, stacks, are, held, together, by, intermeshing, of, the, ends, of, the, staves, by, a, short, distance, around, the, perimeter, of, each, layer, and, hoops, which, are, tightened, directly, across, the, stave, edges, the, static, pressure, of, the, material, inside, the, silo, pressing, outward, on, the, staves, increases, towards, the, bottom, of, the, silo, so, the, hoops, can, be, spaced, wide, apart, near, the, top, but, become, progressively, more, closely, spaced, towards, the, bottom, to, prevent, seams, from, opening, and, the, contents, leaking, out, concrete, stave, silos, are, built, from, common, components, designed, for, high, strength, and, long, life, they, have, the, flexibility, to, have, their, height, increased, according, to, the, needs, of, the, farm, and, purchasing, power, of, the, farmer, or, to, be, completely, disassembled, and, reinstalled, somewhere, else, if, no, longer, needed, low, oxygen, silos, are, designed, to, keep, the, contents, in, a, low, oxygen, atmosphere, at, all, times, to, keep, the, fermented, contents, in, a, high, quality, state, and, to, prevent, mold, and, decay, as, may, occur, in, the, top, layers, of, a, stave, silo, or, bunker, low, oxygen, silos, are, only, opened, directly, to, the, atmosphere, during, the, initial, forage, loading, and, even, the, unloader, chute, is, sealed, against, air, infiltration, it, would, be, expensive, to, design, such, a, huge, structure, that, is, immune, to, atmospheric, pressure, changes, over, time, instead, the, silo, structure, is, open, to, the, atmosphere, but, outside, air, is, separated, from, internal, air, by, large, impermeable, bags, sealed, to, the, silo, breather, openings, in, the, warmth, of, the, day, when, the, silo, is, heated, by, the, sun, the, gas, trapped, inside, the, silo, expands, and, the, bags, breathe, out, and, collapse, at, night, the, silo, cools, the, air, inside, contracts, and, the, bags, breathe, in, and, expand, again, while, the, iconic, blue, harvestore, low, oxygen, silos, were, once, very, common, the, speed, of, its, unloader, mechanism, was, not, able, to, match, the, output, rates, of, modern, bunker, silos, and, this, type, of, silo, went, into, decline, unloader, repair, expenses, also, severely, hurt, the, harvestore, reputation, because, the, unloader, feed, mechanism, is, located, in, the, bottom, of, the, silo, under, tons, of, silage, in, the, event, of, cutter, chain, breakage, it, can, cost, up, to, us, 10, 000, to, perform, repairs, the, silo, may, need, to, be, partially, or, completely, emptied, by, alternate, means, to, unbury, the, broken, unloader, and, retrieve, broken, components, lost, in, the, silage, at, the, bottom, of, the, structure, in, 2005, the, harvestore, company, recognized, these, issues, and, worked, to, develop, new, unloaders, with, double, the, flow, rate, of, previous, models, to, stay, competitive, with, bunkers, and, with, far, greater, unloader, chain, strength, they, are, now, also, using, load, sensing, soft, start, variable, frequency, drive, motor, controllers, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, mechanism, breakage, and, to, control, the, feeder, sweep, arm, movement, bunker, silos, are, trenches, usually, with, concrete, walls, that, are, filled, and, packed, using, tractors, and, loaders, the, filled, trench, is, covered, with, a, plastic, tarp, to, make, it, airtight, these, silos, are, usually, unloaded, with, a, tractor, and, loader, they, are, inexpensive, and, especially, well, suited, to, very, large, operations, bag, silos, are, heavy, plastic, tubes, usually, around, 8, to, 12, ft, 2, 4, to, 3, 6, m, in, diameter, and, of, variable, length, as, required, for, the, amount, of, material, to, be, stored, they, are, packed, using, a, machine, made, for, the, purpose, and, sealed, on, both, ends, they, are, unloaded, using, a, tractor, and, loader, or, skid, steer, loader, the, bag, is, discarded, in, sections, as, it, is, torn, off, bag, silos, require, little, capital, investment, they, can, be, used, as, a, temporary, measure, when, growth, or, harvest, conditions, require, more, space, though, some, farms, use, them, every, year, a, bin, is, typically, much, shorter, than, a, silo, and, is, typically, used, for, holding, dry, matter, such, as, cement, or, grain, grain, is, often, dried, in, a, grain, dryer, before, being, stored, in, the, bin, bins, may, be, round, or, square, but, round, bins, tend, to, empty, more, easily, due, to, a, lack, of, corners, for, the, stored, material, to, become, wedged, and, encrusted, the, stored, material, may, be, powdered, as, seed, kernels, or, as, cob, corn, due, to, the, dry, nature, of, the, stored, material, it, tends, to, be, lighter, than, silage, and, can, be, more, easily, handled, by, under, floor, grain, unloaders, to, facilitate, drying, after, harvesting, some, grain, bins, contain, a, hollow, perforated, or, screened, central, shaft, to, permit, easier, air, infiltration, into, the, stored, grain, there, are, different, types, of, cement, silos, such, as, the, low, level, mobile, silo, and, the, static, upright, cement, silo, which, are, used, to, hold, and, discharge, cement, and, other, powder, materials, such, as, pulverised, fuel, ash, pfa, the, low, level, silos, are, fully, mobile, with, capacities, from, 100, to, 750, tons, they, are, simple, to, transport, and, are, easy, to, set, up, on, site, these, mobile, silos, generally, come, equipped, with, an, electronic, weighing, system, with, digital, display, and, printer, this, allows, any, quantity, of, cement, or, powder, discharged, from, the, silo, to, be, controlled, and, also, provides, an, accurate, indication, of, what, remains, inside, the, silo, the, static, upright, silos, have, capacities, from, 200, to, 800, tons, these, are, considered, a, low, maintenance, option, for, the, storage, of, cement, or, other, powders, cement, silos, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, bin, fed, batching, plants, sand, and, salt, for, winter, road, maintenance, are, stored, in, conical, dome, shaped, clear, truss, roof, silos, these, are, more, common, in, north, america, namely, in, canada, and, the, united, states, the, shaped, is, based, on, natural, shape, formed, when, piling, solids, the, dome, is, made, of, prefabricated, wood, panels, with, shingles, installed, on, a, circular, reinforced, concrete, base, open, canopy, entrance, allows, for, front, end, loaders, to, fill, and, retrieve, easily, these, are, usually, found, along, major, highway, or, key, primary, roads, plastic, silos, also, known, as, hopper, bottom, tanks, are, manufactured, through, various, processes, such, as, injection, molding, rotational, molding, and, blow, molding, they, are, constructed, using, a, wide, variety, of, polyethylene, plastics, the, silos, are, light, weight, and, make, for, great, small, scale, storage, for, farmers, with, livestock, and, grain, operations, the, light, weight, design, and, cost, effective, materials, make, plastic, silos, a, great, alternative, to, traditional, steel, bins, unlike, fabric, silos, which, tend, to, be, prone, to, grain, rot, and, pests, which, have, left, many, farmers, frustrated, plastic, silos, are, more, safe, and, secure, keeping, grain, fresh, and, unspoiled, they, can, be, designed, to, be, stationary, hopper, bottom, bins, or, portable, pallet, bins, fabric, silos, are, constructed, of, a, fabric, bag, suspended, within, a, rigid, structural, frame, polyester, based, fabrics, are, often, used, for, fabrication, of, the, bag, material, with, specific, attention, given, to, fabric, pore, size, upper, areas, of, silo, fabric, are, often, manufactured, with, slightly, larger, pore, size, with, the, design, intent, of, acting, as, a, vent, filter, during, silo, filling, some, designs, include, metal, thread, within, the, fabric, providing, a, static, conductive, path, from, the, surface, of, the, fabric, to, ground, the, frame, of, a, fabric, silo, is, typically, constructed, of, steel, fabric, silos, are, an, attractive, option, because, of, their, relative, low, cost, compared, to, conventional, silos, however, when, fabric, silos, are, used, to, store, granular, or, particulate, combustible, materials, conventional, practices, prescribed, by, established, industry, consensus, standards, addressing, combustible, dust, hazards, can, not, be, applied, without, a, considerable, engineering, analysis, of, the, system, flexible, silos, are, the, most, versatile, and, cost, effective, solution, for, the, storage, of, bulk, powder, and, granules, manufactured, from, trevira, tissue, a, tough, non, toxic, fabric, the, silos, can, handle, particle, size, down, to, 2, microns, and, can, be, pneumatically, loaded, without, the, need, for, a, dust, collector, the, 45, degree, fabric, silo, cone, flexes, freely, when, the, product, discharges, enabling, the, efficient, flow, of, hard, to, handle, products, such, as, sugar, flour, calcium, carbonate, etc, minimally, assisted, by, a, small, vibrator, fitted, to, the, discharge, transition, the, trevira, tissue, is, able, to, breathe, preventing, condensation, from, forming, on, its, internal, walls, this, eliminates, lumping, and, caking, of, the, product, with, sizes, ranging, from, 2m, 3, to, over, 1000m, 3, rigid, silos, cover, an, extreme, range, of, applications, and, they, can, be, constructed, from, various, materials, rigid, silos, can, be, provided, with, more, than, one, vertical, partition, to, compartmentalize, it, for, different, grades, of, product, the, 5th, millennium, bc, site, of, tel, tsaf, in, the, southern, levant, contain, the, earliest, known, silos, archaeological, ruins, and, ancient, texts, show, that, silos, were, used, in, ancient, greece, as, far, back, as, the, late, 8th, century, bc, the, term, silo, is, derived, from, the, greek, siros, pit, for, holding, grain, the, silo, pit, as, it, has, been, termed, has, been, a, favorite, way, of, storing, grain, from, time, immemorial, in, asia, in, turkey, and, persia, insurance, agents, bought, stores, of, wheat, or, barley, whilst, comparatively, cheap, and, store, it, in, hidden, pits, against, seasons, of, dearth, in, malta, a, relatively, large, stock, of, wheat, was, preserved, in, some, hundreds, of, pits, silos, cut, in, the, rock, a, single, silo, stored, from, 60, to, 80, tons, of, wheat, which, with, proper, precautions, kept, in, good, condition, for, four, years, or, more, the, first, modern, silo, a, wooden, and, upright, one, filled, with, grain, was, invented, and, built, in, 1873, in, spring, grove, illinois, by, fred, hatch, of, mchenry, county, illinois, us, forage, silo, filling, is, performed, using, a, forage, harvester, which, may, either, be, self, propelled, with, an, engine, and, driver, s, cab, or, towed, behind, a, tractor, that, supplies, power, through, a, pto, the, harvester, contains, a, drum, shaped, series, of, cutting, knives, which, shear, the, fibrous, plant, material, into, small, pieces, no, more, than, an, inch, long, to, facilitate, mechanized, blowing, and, transport, via, augers, the, finely, chopped, plant, material, is, then, blown, by, the, harvester, into, a, forage, wagon, which, contains, an, automatic, unloading, system, tower, forage, filling, is, typically, performed, with, a, silo, blower, which, is, a, very, large, fan, with, paddle, shaped, blades, material, is, fed, into, a, vibrating, hopper, and, is, pushed, into, the, blower, using, a, spinning, spiral, auger, there, is, commonly, a, water, connection, on, the, blower, to, add, moisture, to, the, plant, matter, being, blown, into, the, silo, the, blower, may, be, driven, by, an, electric, motor, but, it, is, more, common, to, use, a, spare, tractor, instead, a, large, slow, moving, conveyor, chain, underneath, the, silage, in, the, forage, wagon, moves, the, pile, towards, the, front, where, rows, of, rotating, teeth, break, up, the, pile, and, drop, it, onto, a, high, speed, transverse, conveyor, that, pours, the, silage, out, the, side, of, the, wagon, into, the, blower, hopper, silo, bags, are, filled, using, a, traveling, sled, driven, from, the, pto, of, a, tractor, left, in, neutral, and, which, is, gradually, pushed, forward, as, the, bag, is, filled, the, steering, of, the, tractor, controls, the, direction, of, bag, placement, as, it, fills, but, bags, are, normally, laid, in, a, straight, line, the, bag, is, loaded, using, the, same, forage, harvesting, methods, as, the, tower, but, the, forage, wagon, must, be, moved, progressively, forward, with, the, bag, loader, the, loader, uses, an, array, of, rotating, cam, shaped, spiraled, teeth, associated, with, a, large, comb, shaped, tines, to, push, forage, into, the, bag, the, forage, is, pushed, in, through, a, large, opening, and, as, the, teeth, rotate, back, out, they, pass, between, the, comb, tines, the, cam, shaped, auger, teeth, essentially, wipe, the, forage, off, using, the, steel, tines, keeping, the, forage, in, the, bag, before, filling, begins, the, entire, bag, is, placed, onto, the, loader, as, a, bunched, up, tube, folded, back, on, itself, in, many, layers, to, form, a, thick, pile, of, plastic, because, the, plastic, is, minimally, elastic, the, loader, mechanism, filling, chute, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, final, size, of, the, bag, to, accommodate, this, stack, of, plastic, around, the, mouth, of, the, loader, the, plastic, slowly, unfurls, itself, around, the, edges, of, the, loader, as, the, tube, is, filled, the, contents, of, the, silo, bag, are, under, pressure, as, it, is, filled, with, the, pressure, controlled, by, a, large, brake, shoe, pressure, regulator, holding, back, two, large, winch, drums, on, either, side, of, the, loader, cables, from, the, drum, extend, to, the, rear, of, the, bag, where, a, large, mesh, basket, holds, the, rear, end, of, the, bag, shut, to, prevent, molding, and, to, assure, an, airtight, seal, during, fermentation, the, ends, of, the, silo, bag, tube, are, gathered, folded, and, tied, shut, to, prevent, oxygen, from, entering, the, bag, removal, of, the, bag, loader, can, be, hazardous, to, bystanders, since, the, pressure, must, be, released, and, the, rear, end, allowed, to, collapse, onto, the, ground, a, silo, unloader, specifically, refers, to, a, special, cylindrical, rotating, forage, pickup, device, used, inside, a, single, tower, silo, the, main, operating, component, of, the, silo, unloader, is, suspended, in, the, silo, from, a, steel, cable, on, a, pulley, that, is, mounted, in, the, top, center, of, the, roof, of, the, silo, the, vertical, positioning, of, the, unloader, is, controlled, by, an, electric, winch, on, the, exterior, of, the, silo, for, the, summer, filling, of, a, tower, silo, the, unloader, is, winched, as, high, as, possible, to, the, top, of, the, silo, and, put, into, a, parking, position, the, silo, is, filled, with, a, silo, blower, which, is, literally, a, very, large, fan, that, blows, a, large, volume, of, pressurized, air, up, a, 10, inch, tube, on, the, side, of, the, silo, a, small, amount, of, water, is, introduced, into, the, air, stream, during, filling, to, help, lubricate, the, filling, tube, a, small, adjustable, nozzle, at, the, top, controlled, by, a, handle, at, the, base, of, the, silo, directs, the, silage, to, fall, into, the, silo, on, the, near, middle, or, far, side, to, facilitate, evenly, layered, loading, once, completely, filled, the, top, of, the, exposed, silage, pile, is, covered, with, a, large, heavy, sheet, of, silo, plastic, which, seals, out, oxygen, and, permits, the, entire, pile, to, begin, to, ferment, in, the, autumn, in, the, winter, when, animals, must, be, kept, indoors, the, silo, plastic, is, removed, the, unloader, is, lowered, down, onto, the, top, of, the, silage, pile, and, a, hinged, door, is, opened, on, the, side, of, the, silo, to, permit, the, silage, to, be, blown, out, there, is, an, array, of, these, access, doors, arranged, vertically, up, the, side, of, the, silo, with, an, unloading, tube, next, to, the, doors, that, has, a, series, of, removable, covers, down, the, side, of, the, tube, the, unloader, tube, and, access, doors, are, normally, covered, with, a, large, u, shaped, shield, mounted, on, the, silo, to, protect, the, farmer, from, wind, snow, and, rain, while, working, on, the, silo, the, silo, unloader, mechanism, consists, of, a, pair, of, counter, rotating, toothed, augers, which, rip, up, the, surface, of, the, silage, and, pull, it, towards, the, center, of, the, unloader, the, toothed, augers, rotate, in, a, circle, around, the, center, hub, evenly, chewing, the, silage, off, the, surface, of, the, pile, in, the, center, a, large, blower, assembly, picks, up, the, silage, and, blows, it, out, the, silo, door, where, the, silage, falls, by, gravity, down, the, unloader, tube, to, the, bottom, of, the, silo, typically, into, an, automated, conveyor, system, the, unloader, is, typically, lowered, only, a, half, inch, or, so, at, a, time, by, the, operator, and, the, unloader, picks, up, only, a, small, amount, of, material, until, the, winch, cable, has, become, taut, and, the, unloader, is, not, picking, up, any, more, material, the, operator, then, lowers, the, unloader, another, half, inch, or, so, and, the, process, repeats, if, lowered, too, far, the, unloader, can, pull, up, much, more, material, than, it, can, handle, which, can, overflow, and, plug, up, the, blower, outlet, spout, and, the, unloader, tube, resulting, in, a, time, wasting, process, of, having, to, climb, up, the, silo, to, clear, the, blockages, once, silage, has, entered, the, conveyor, system, it, can, be, handled, by, either, manual, or, automatic, distribution, systems, the, simplest, manual, distribution, system, uses, a, sliding, metal, platform, under, the, pickup, channel, when, slid, open, the, forage, drops, through, the, open, hole, and, down, a, chute, into, a, wagon, wheelbarrow, or, open, pile, when, closed, the, forage, continues, past, the, opening, and, onward, to, other, parts, of, the, conveyor, computer, automation, and, a, conveyor, running, the, length, of, a, feeding, stall, can, permit, the, silage, to, be, automatically, dropped, from, above, to, each, animal, with, the, amount, dispensed, customized, for, each, location, silos, are, hazardous, and, people, are, killed, or, injured, every, year, in, the, process, of, filling, and, maintaining, them, the, machinery, used, is, dangerous, and, workers, can, fall, from, a, tower, silo, s, ladder, or, work, platform, several, fires, have, occurred, over, the, years, filling, a, silo, requires, parking, two, tractors, very, close, to, each, other, both, running, at, full, power, and, with, live, pto, shafts, one, powering, the, silo, blower, and, the, other, powering, a, forage, wagon, unloading, fresh, cut, forage, into, the, blower, the, farmer, must, continually, move, around, in, this, highly, hazardous, environment, of, spinning, shafts, and, high, speed, conveyors, to, check, material, flows, and, adjust, speeds, and, to, start, and, stop, all, the, equipment, between, loads, preparation, for, filling, a, silo, requires, winching, the, unloader, to, the, top, and, any, remaining, forage, at, the, base, that, the, unloader, could, not, pick, up, must, be, removed, from, the, floor, of, the, silo, this, job, requires, that, the, farmer, work, directly, underneath, a, machine, weighing, several, tons, suspended, fifty, feet, or, more, overhead, from, a, small, steel, cable, should, the, unloader, fall, the, farmer, will, likely, be, killed, instantly, unloading, also, poses, its, own, special, hazards, due, to, the, requirement, that, the, farmer, regularly, climb, the, silo, to, close, an, upper, door, and, open, a, lower, door, moving, the, unloader, chute, from, door, to, door, in, the, process, the, fermentation, of, the, silage, produces, methane, gas, which, over, time, will, outgas, and, displace, the, oxygen, in, the, top, of, the, silo, a, farmer, directly, entering, a, silo, without, any, other, precautions, can, be, asphyxiated, by, the, methane, knocked, unconscious, and, silently, suffocate, to, death, before, anyone, else, knows, what, has, happened, it, is, either, necessary, to, leave, the, silo, blower, attached, to, the, silo, at, all, times, to, use, it, when, necessary, to, ventilate, the, silo, with, fresh, air, or, to, have, a, dedicated, electric, fan, system, to, blow, fresh, air, into, the, silo, before, anyone, attempts, to, enter, it, in, the, event, that, the, unloader, mechanism, becomes, plugged, the, farmer, must, climb, the, silo, and, directly, stand, on, the, unloader, reaching, into, the, blower, spout, to, dig, out, the, soft, silage, after, clearing, a, plug, the, forage, needs, to, be, forked, out, into, an, even, layer, around, the, unloader, so, that, the, unloader, does, not, immediately, dig, into, the, pile, and, plug, itself, again, all, during, this, process, the, farmer, is, standing, on, or, near, a, machine, that, could, easily, kill, them, in, seconds, if, it, were, to, accidentally, start, up, this, could, happen, if, someone, in, the, barn, were, to, unknowingly, switch, on, the, unloading, mechanism, while, someone, is, in, the, silo, working, on, the, unloader, often, when, unloading, grain, from, an, auger, or, other, opening, at, the, bottom, of, the, silo, another, worker, will, be, atop, the, grain, walking, it, down, to, ensure, an, even, flow, of, grain, out, of, the, silo, sometimes, unstable, pockets, in, the, grain, will, collapse, beneath, the, worker, doing, the, walking, this, is, called, grain, entrapment, as, the, worker, can, be, completely, sunk, into, the, grain, within, seconds, entrapment, can, also, occur, in, moving, grain, or, when, workers, clear, large, clumps, of, grain, that, have, become, stuck, on, the, side, of, the, silo, this, often, results, in, death, by, suffocation, there, have, also, been, many, cases, of, bins, and, the, associated, ducts, and, buildings, exploding, if, the, air, inside, becomes, laden, with, finely, granulated, particles, such, as, grain, dust, a, spark, can, trigger, a, dust, explosion, powerful, enough, to, blow, a, concrete, silo, and, adjacent, buildings, apart, usually, setting, the, adjacent, grain, and, building, on, fire, sparks, are, often, caused, by, metal, rubbing, against, metal, ducts, or, due, to, static, electricity, produced, by, dust, moving, along, the, ducts, when, extra, dry, the, two, main, problems, which, will, necessitate, silo, cleaning, in, bins,
