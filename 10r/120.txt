consumer, electronics, or, home, electronics, are, electronic, analog, or, digital, equipment, intended, for, everyday, use, typically, in, private, homes, consumer, electronics, include, devices, used, for, entertainment, communications, and, recreation, these, products, are, usually, referred, to, as, black, goods, due, to, many, products, being, housed, in, black, or, dark, casings, this, term, is, used, to, distinguish, them, from, white, goods, which, are, meant, for, housekeeping, tasks, such, as, washing, machines, and, refrigerators, although, nowadays, these, would, be, considered, black, goods, some, of, these, being, connected, to, the, internet, in, british, english, they, are, often, called, brown, goods, by, producers, and, sellers, in, the, 2010s, this, distinction, is, absent, in, large, big, box, consumer, electronics, stores, which, sell, entertainment, communication, and, home, office, devices, light, fixtures, and, appliances, including, the, bathroom, type, radio, broadcasting, in, the, early, 20th, century, brought, the, first, major, consumer, product, the, broadcast, receiver, later, products, included, telephones, televisions, and, calculators, then, audio, and, video, recorders, and, players, game, consoles, mobile, phones, personal, computers, and, mp3, players, in, the, 2010s, consumer, electronics, stores, often, sell, gps, automotive, electronics, car, stereos, video, game, consoles, electronic, musical, instruments, e, g, synthesizer, keyboards, karaoke, machines, digital, cameras, and, video, players, vcrs, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, followed, by, dvd, players, and, blu, ray, players, stores, also, sell, smart, light, fixtures, and, appliances, digital, cameras, camcorders, cell, phones, and, smartphones, some, of, the, newer, products, sold, include, virtual, reality, head, mounted, display, goggles, smart, home, devices, that, connect, home, devices, to, the, internet, streaming, devices, and, wearable, technology, in, the, 2010s, most, consumer, electronics, have, become, based, on, digital, technologies, they, have, essentially, merged, with, the, computer, industry, in, what, is, increasingly, referred, to, as, the, consumerization, of, information, technology, some, consumer, electronics, stores, have, also, begun, selling, office, and, baby, furniture, consumer, electronics, stores, may, be, brick, and, mortar, physical, retail, stores, online, stores, or, combinations, of, both, annual, consumer, electronics, sales, are, expected, to, reach, 2, 9, trillion, by, 2020, it, is, part, of, the, wider, electronics, industry, in, turn, the, driving, force, behind, the, electronics, industry, is, the, semiconductor, industry, for, its, first, fifty, years, the, phonograph, turntable, did, not, use, electronics, the, needle, and, sound, horn, were, purely, mechanical, technologies, however, in, the, 1920s, radio, broadcasting, became, the, basis, of, mass, production, of, radio, receivers, the, vacuum, tubes, that, had, made, radios, practical, were, used, with, record, players, as, well, to, amplify, the, sound, so, that, it, could, be, played, through, a, loudspeaker, television, was, soon, invented, but, remained, insignificant, in, the, consumer, market, until, the, 1950s, the, first, working, transistor, a, point, contact, transistor, was, invented, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, houser, brattain, at, bell, laboratories, in, 1947, which, led, to, significant, research, in, the, field, of, solid, state, semiconductors, in, the, early, 1950s, the, invention, and, development, of, the, earliest, transistors, at, bell, led, to, transistor, radios, this, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, home, entertainment, consumer, electronics, industry, starting, in, the, 1950s, largely, due, to, the, efforts, of, tokyo, tsushin, kogyo, now, sony, in, successfully, commercializing, transistor, technology, for, a, mass, market, with, affordable, transistor, radios, and, then, transistorized, television, sets, integrated, circuits, ics, followed, when, manufacturers, built, circuits, usually, for, military, purposes, on, a, single, substrate, using, electrical, connections, between, circuits, within, the, chip, itself, ic, technology, led, to, more, advanced, and, cheaper, consumer, electronics, such, as, transistorized, televisions, pocket, calculators, and, by, the, 1980s, affordable, video, game, consoles, and, personal, computers, that, regular, middle, class, families, could, buy, starting, in, the, 1980s, with, the, compact, disc, and, the, introduction, of, personal, computers, and, until, the, early, 2000s, many, consumer, electronics, devices, such, as, televisions, and, stereo, systems, were, digitized, digital, computer, technology, and, thus, digital, signals, were, integrated, into, the, operation, of, consumer, electronics, devices, drastically, changing, their, operation, but, with, improved, results, such, as, improved, image, quality, in, televisions, this, was, made, possible, by, moore, s, law, in, 2004, the, consumer, electronics, industry, was, worth, us, 240, billion, annually, worldwide, comprising, visual, equipment, audio, equipment, and, games, consoles, it, was, truly, global, with, asia, pacific, having, 35, market, share, europe, having, 31, 5, the, us, having, 23, and, the, rest, of, the, world, having, the, rest, major, players, in, this, industry, are, household, names, like, sony, samsung, philips, sanyo, and, sharp, samsung, electronics, is, part, of, the, samsung, group, in, 2003, combined, revenues, for, samsung, electronics, were, 55, billion, samsung, electronics, uk, is, a, subsidiary, of, samsung, electronics, contributing, 1, 2, billion, in, revenues, samsung, electronics, has, one, of, the, highest, r, d, expenditure, as, a, proportion, of, revenues, in, the, industry, and, spent, about, 2, 9, billion, in, 2003, along, with, its, competitors, samsung, electronics, is, global, and, employs, 88, 000, people, in, 89, offices, in, 46, countries, not, including, facilities, in, korea, it, has, 24, manufacturing, complexes, 40, distribution, bases, and, 15, branches, spread, over, all, continents, except, antarctica, countries, with, manufacturing, facilities, include, the, us, malaysia, china, india, and, hungary, the, increase, in, popularity, of, such, domestic, appliances, as, white, goods, is, a, characteristic, element, of, consumption, patterns, during, the, golden, age, of, the, western, economy, europe, s, white, goods, industry, has, evolved, over, the, past, 40, years, first, by, changing, tariff, barriers, and, later, by, technical, and, demand, shifts, the, spending, on, domestic, appliances, has, claimed, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, disposable, income, rising, from, 0, 5, percent, in, the, us, in, 1920, to, about, 2, percent, in, 1980, yet, the, sequence, of, electrical, and, mechanical, durables, have, altered, the, activities, and, experiences, of, households, in, america, and, britain, in, the, twentieth, century, with, the, expansion, of, cookers, vacuum, cleaners, refrigerators, washing, machines, radios, televisions, air, conditioning, and, microwave, ovens, households, have, gained, an, escalating, number, of, appliances, despite, the, ubiquity, of, these, goods, their, diffusion, is, not, well, understood, some, types, of, appliances, diffuse, more, frequently, than, others, in, particular, home, entertainment, appliances, such, as, radio, and, television, have, diffused, much, faster, than, household, and, kitchen, machines, consumer, electronics, devices, include, those, used, for, increasingly, consumer, electronics, products, such, as, digital, distribution, of, video, games, have, become, based, on, the, internet, and, digital, technologies, the, consumer, electronics, industry, has, primarily, merged, with, the, software, industry, in, what, is, increasingly, referred, to, as, the, consumerization, of, information, technology, one, overriding, characteristic, of, consumer, electronic, products, is, the, trend, of, ever, falling, prices, this, is, driven, by, gains, in, manufacturing, efficiency, and, automation, lower, labor, costs, as, manufacturing, has, moved, to, lower, wage, countries, and, improvements, in, semiconductor, design, semiconductor, components, benefit, from, moore, s, law, an, observed, principle, which, states, that, for, a, given, price, semiconductor, functionality, doubles, every, two, years, while, consumer, electronics, continues, in, its, trend, of, convergence, combining, elements, of, many, products, consumers, face, different, purchasing, decisions, there, is, an, ever, increasing, need, to, keep, product, information, updated, and, comparable, for, the, consumer, to, make, an, informed, choice, style, price, specification, and, performance, are, all, relevant, there, are, a, gradual, shift, towards, e, commerce, web, storefronts, many, products, include, internet, connectivity, using, technologies, such, as, wi, fi, bluetooth, edge, or, ethernet, products, not, traditionally, associated, with, computer, use, such, as, tvs, or, hi, fi, equipment, now, provide, options, to, connect, to, the, internet, or, to, a, computer, using, a, home, network, to, provide, access, to, digital, content, the, desire, for, high, definition, hd, content, has, led, the, industry, to, develop, a, number, of, technologies, such, as, wirelesshd, or, itu, t, g, hn, which, are, optimized, for, distribution, of, hd, content, between, consumer, electronic, devices, in, a, home, the, consumer, electronics, industry, faces, consumers, with, unpredictable, tastes, on, the, demand, side, supplier, related, delays, or, disruptions, on, the, supply, side, and, production, challenges, occurring, in, the, process, the, high, rate, of, technology, evolution, or, revolution, requires, large, investments, without, any, guarantee, of, profitable, returns, as, a, result, the, big, players, rely, on, global, markets, to, achieve, economies, of, scale, even, these, companies, sometimes, have, to, cooperate, with, each, other, for, instance, on, standards, to, reduce, the, risk, of, their, investments, in, supply, chain, management, there, is, much, discussion, on, risks, related, to, such, aspects, of, supply, chains, as, short, product, life, cycles, high, competition, combined, with, cooperation, and, globalization, the, consumer, electronics, industry, is, the, very, embodiment, of, these, aspects, of, supply, chain, management, and, related, risks, while, some, of, the, supply, and, demand, related, risks, are, similar, to, such, industries, as, the, toy, industry, the, consumer, electronics, industry, faces, additional, risks, due, to, its, vertically, integrated, supply, chains, there, are, also, numerous, supply, chain, wide, contextual, risks, that, cut, across, the, supply, chain, especially, impacting, companies, with, global, supply, chains, these, include, cultural, differences, in, multinational, operations, environmental, risk, regulations, risk, and, exchange, rate, risk, across, multiple, countries, whether, or, not, demand, is, comparable, across, countries, affects, the, extent, of, the, gains, from, international, integration, in, addition, consumer, preferences, change, over, time, to, disturb, existing, patterns, of, behavior, a, feature, of, some, industries, is, that, demand, for, variety, increases, as, the, market, moves, from, first, time, buying, to, replacement, demand, a, resource, to, further, understand, this, idea, of, consumer, preferences, can, be, observed, through, lizabeth, cohen, s, book, titled, a, consumers, republic, only, if, we, have, large, demands, can, we, expect, large, production, the, electronics, industry, especially, consumer, electronics, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, and, has, become, a, global, industry, worth, billions, of, dollars, contemporary, society, uses, all, manner, of, electronic, devices, built, in, automated, or, semi, automated, factories, operated, by, the, industry, most, consumer, electronics, are, built, in, china, due, to, maintenance, cost, availability, of, materials, quality, and, speed, as, opposed, to, other, countries, such, as, the, united, states, cities, such, as, shenzhen, have, become, important, production, centres, for, the, industry, attracting, many, consumer, electronics, companies, such, as, apple, inc, an, electronic, component, is, any, essential, discrete, device, or, physical, entity, in, an, electronic, system, used, to, affect, electrons, or, their, associated, fields, electronic, components, are, mostly, industrial, products, available, in, a, singular, form, and, are, not, to, be, confused, with, electrical, elements, conceptual, abstractions, representing, idealized, electronic, components, consumer, electronics, such, as, personal, computers, use, various, types, of, software, embedded, software, is, used, within, some, consumer, electronics, such, as, mobile, phones, this, type, of, software, may, be, embedded, within, the, hardware, of, electronic, devices, some, consumer, electronics, include, software, that, is, used, on, a, personal, computer, in, conjunction, with, electronic, devices, such, as, camcorders, and, digital, cameras, and, third, party, software, for, such, devices, also, exists, some, consumer, electronics, adhere, to, protocols, such, as, connection, protocols, to, high, speed, bi, directional, signals, in, telecommunications, a, communications, protocol, is, a, system, of, digital, rules, for, data, exchange, within, or, between, computers, the, consumer, electronics, show, ces, trade, show, has, taken, place, yearly, in, las, vegas, nevada, since, its, foundation, in, 1973, the, event, which, grew, from, having, 100, exhibitors, in, its, inaugural, year, to, more, than, 4, 500, exhibiting, companies, in, its, 2020, edition, features, the, latest, in, consumer, electronics, speeches, by, industry, experts, and, innovation, awards, the, internationale, funkausstellung, berlin, ifa, trade, show, has, taken, place, berlin, germany, since, its, foundation, in, 1924, the, event, features, new, consumer, electronics, and, speeches, by, industry, pioneers, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, the, world, s, largest, professional, society, has, many, initiatives, to, advance, the, state, of, the, art, of, consumer, electronics, ieee, has, a, dedicated, society, of, thousands, of, professionals, to, promote, ce, called, the, consumer, electronics, society, cesoc, ieee, has, multiple, periodicals, and, international, conferences, to, promote, ce, and, encourage, collaborative, research, and, development, in, ce, the, flagship, conference, of, cesoc, called, ieee, international, conference, on, consumer, electronics, icce, is, in, its, 35th, year, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, computer, society, also, have, initiated, a, conference, to, research, on, next, generation, consumer, electronics, as, smart, electronics, the, conference, named, ieee, symposium, on, smart, electronics, systems, ieee, ises, is, on, its, 9th, year, electronics, retailing, is, a, significant, part, of, the, retail, industry, in, many, countries, in, the, united, states, dedicated, consumer, electronics, stores, have, mostly, given, way, to, big, box, retailers, such, as, best, buy, the, largest, consumer, electronics, retailer, in, the, country, although, smaller, dedicated, stores, include, apple, stores, and, specialist, stores, that, serve, for, example, audiophiles, and, exceptions, such, as, the, single, branch, b, h, photo, store, in, new, york, city, broad, based, retailers, such, as, walmart, and, target, also, sell, consumer, electronics, in, many, of, their, stores, in, april, 2014, retail, e, commerce, sales, were, the, highest, in, the, consumer, electronic, and, computer, categories, as, well, some, consumer, electronics, retailers, offer, extended, warranties, on, products, with, programs, such, as, squaretrade, an, electronics, district, is, an, area, of, commerce, with, a, high, density, of, retail, stores, that, sell, consumer, electronics, consumer, electronic, service, can, refer, to, the, maintenance, of, said, products, when, consumer, electronics, have, malfunctions, they, may, sometimes, be, repaired, in, 2013, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the, increased, popularity, in, listening, to, sound, from, analog, audio, devices, such, as, record, players, as, opposed, to, digital, sound, has, sparked, a, noticeable, increase, of, business, for, the, electronic, repair, industry, there, a, mobile, phone, cellular, phone, cell, phone, cellphone, handphone, or, hand, phone, sometimes, shortened, to, simply, mobile, cell, or, just, phone, is, a, portable, telephone, that, can, make, and, receive, calls, over, a, radio, frequency, link, while, the, user, is, moving, within, a, telephone, service, area, the, radio, frequency, link, establishes, a, connection, to, the, switching, systems, of, a, mobile, phone, operator, which, provides, access, to, the, public, switched, telephone, network, pstn, modern, mobile, telephone, services, use, a, cellular, network, architecture, and, therefore, mobile, telephones, are, called, cellular, telephones, or, cell, phones, in, north, america, in, addition, to, telephony, digital, mobile, phones, 2g, support, a, variety, of, other, services, such, as, text, messaging, mms, email, internet, access, short, range, wireless, communications, infrared, bluetooth, business, applications, video, games, and, digital, photography, mobile, phones, offering, only, those, capabilities, are, known, as, feature, phones, mobile, phones, which, offer, greatly, advanced, computing, capabilities, are, referred, to, as, smartphones, a, smartphone, is, a, portable, device, that, combines, mobile, telephone, and, computing, functions, into, one, unit, they, are, distinguished, from, feature, phones, by, their, stronger, hardware, capabilities, and, extensive, mobile, operating, systems, which, facilitate, wider, software, internet, including, web, browsing, over, mobile, broadband, and, multimedia, functionality, including, music, video, cameras, and, gaming, alongside, core, phone, functions, such, as, voice, calls, and, text, messaging, smartphones, typically, contain, a, number, of, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, include, various, sensors, that, can, be, leveraged, by, pre, included, and, third, party, software, such, as, a, magnetometer, proximity, sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer, and, more, and, support, wireless, communications, protocols, such, as, bluetooth, wi, fi, or, satellite, navigation, in, 2017, the, greenpeace, usa, published, a, study, of, 17, of, the, world, s, leading, consumer, electronics, companies, about, their, energy, and, resource, consumption, and, the, use, of, chemicals, electronic, devices, use, thousands, rare, metals, and, rare, earth, elements, 40, on, average, for, a, smartphone, these, material, are, extracted, and, refined, using, water, and, energy, intensive, processes, these, metals, are, also, used, in, the, renewable, energy, industry, meaning, that, consumer, electronics, are, directly, competing, for, the, raw, materials, the, energy, consumption, of, consumer, electronics, and, their, environmental, impact, either, from, their, production, processes, or, the, disposal, of, the, devices, is, increasing, steadily, eia, estimates, that, electronic, devices, and, gadgets, account, for, about, 10, 15, of, the, energy, use, in, american, homes, largely, because, of, their, number, the, average, house, has, dozens, of, electronic, devices, the, energy, consumption, of, consumer, electronics, increases, in, america, and, europe, to, about, 50, of, household, consumption, if, the, term, is, redefined, to, include, home, appliances, such, as, refrigerators, dryers, clothes, washers, and, dishwashers, standby, power, used, by, consumer, electronics, and, appliances, while, they, are, turned, off, accounts, for, 5, 10, of, total, household, energy, consumption, costing, 100, annually, to, the, average, household, in, the, united, states, a, study, by, united, states, department, of, energy, s, berkeley, lab, found, that, a, videocassette, recorders, vcrs, consume, more, electricity, during, the, course, of, a, year, in, standby, mode, than, when, they, are, used, to, record, or, playback, videos, similar, findings, were, obtained, concerning, satellite, boxes, which, consume, almost, the, same, amount, of, energy, in, on, and, off, modes, a, 2012, study, in, the, united, kingdom, carried, out, by, the, energy, saving, trust, found, that, the, devices, using, the, most, power, on, standby, mode, included, televisions, satellite, boxes, and, other, video, and, audio, equipment, the, study, concluded, that, uk, households, could, save, up, to, 86, per, year, by, switching, devices, off, instead, of, using, standby, mode, a, report, from, the, international, energy, agency, in, 2014, found, that, 80, billion, of, power, is, wasted, globally, per, year, due, to, inefficiency, of, electronic, devices, consumers, can, reduce, unwanted, use, of, standby, power, by, unplugging, their, devices, using, power, strips, with, switches, or, by, buying, devices, that, are, standardized, for, better, energy, management, particularly, energy, star, marked, products, a, high, number, of, different, metals, and, low, concentration, rates, in, electronics, means, that, recycling, is, limited, and, energy, intensive, electronic, waste, describes, discarded, electrical, or, electronic, devices, many, consumer, electronics, may, contain, toxic, minerals, and, elements, and, many, electronic, scrap, components, such, as, crts, may, contain, contaminants, such, as, lead, cadmium, beryllium, mercury, dioxins, or, brominated, flame, retardants, electronic, waste, recycling, may, involve, significant, risk, to, workers, and, communities, and, great, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, unsafe, exposure, in, recycling, operations, and, leaking, of, materials, such, as, heavy, metals, from, landfills, and, incinerator, ashes, however, large, amounts, of, the, produced, electronic, waste, from, developed, countries, is, exported, and, handled, by, the, informal, sector, in, countries, like, india, despite, the, fact, that, exporting, electronic, waste, to, them, is, illegal, strong, informal, sector, can, be, a, problem, for, the, safe, and, clean, recycling, reuse, and, repair, e, waste, policy, has, gone, through, various, incarnations, since, the, 1970s, with, emphases, changing, as, the, decades, passed, more, weight, was, gradually, placed, on, the, need, to, dispose, of, e, waste, more, carefully, due, to, the, toxic, materials, it, may, contain, there, has, also, been, recognition, that, various, valuable, metals, and, plastics, from, waste, electrical, equipment, can, be, recycled, for, other, uses, more, recently, the, desirability, of, reusing, whole, appliances, has, been, foregrounded, in, the, preparation, for, reuse, guidelines, the, policy, focus, is, slowly, moving, towards, a, potential, shift, in, attitudes, to, reuse, and, repair, with, turnover, of, small, household, appliances, high, and, costs, relatively, low, many, consumers, will, throw, unwanted, electric, goods, in, the, normal, dustbin, meaning, that, items, of, potentially, high, reuse, or, recycling, value, go, to, landfills, while, more, oversized, items, such, as, washing, machines, are, usually, collected, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, 160, 000, tonnes, of, eee, in, regular, waste, collections, were, worth, 220, million, and, 23, of, eee, taken, to, household, waste, recycling, centres, was, immediately, resaleable, or, would, be, with, minor, repairs, or, refurbishment, this, indicates, a, lack, of, awareness, among, consumers, about, where, and, how, to, dispose, of, eee, and, the, potential, value, of, things, that, are, going, in, the, bin, for, the, reuse, and, repair, of, electrical, goods, to, increase, substantially, in, the, uk, some, barriers, must, be, overcome, these, include, people, s, mistrust, of, used, equipment, in, terms, of, whether, it, will, be, functional, safe, and, the, stigma, for, some, of, owning, second, hand, goods, but, the, benefits, of, reuse, could, allow, lower, income, households, access, to, previously, unaffordable, technology, while, helping, the, environment, at, the, same, time, desktop, monitors, and, laptops, produce, major, physical, health, concerns, for, humans, when, bodies, are, forced, into, unhealthy, and, uncomfortable, positions, to, see, the, screen, better, from, this, neck, and, back, pains, and, problems, increase, commonly, referred, to, as, repetitive, strain, injuries, using, electronics, before, going, to, bed, makes, it, difficult, for, people, to, fall, asleep, hurting, human, health, sleeping, less, prevents, people, from, performing, to, their, full, potential, physically, and, mentally, and, can, also, increase, rates, of, obesity, and, diabetes, which, are, long, term, health, consequences, obesity, and, diabetes, are, more, commonly, seen, in, students, and, in, youth, because, they, tend, to, be, the, ones, using, electronics, the, most, people, who, frequently, use, their, thumbs, to, type, text, messages, on, cell, phones, can, develop, a, painful, affliction, called, de, quervain, syndrome, that, affects, their, tendons, on, their, hands, the, best, known, disease, in, this, category, is, called, carpal, tunnel, syndrome, which, results, from, pressure, on, the, median, nerve, in, the, wrist
