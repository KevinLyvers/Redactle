an, aerial, tramway, aerial, tram, sky, tram, aerial, cablecar, aerial, cableway, telepherique, or, seilbahn, is, a, type, of, aerial, lift, which, uses, one, or, two, stationary, ropes, for, support, while, a, third, moving, rope, provides, propulsion, with, this, form, of, lift, the, grip, of, an, aerial, tramway, cabin, is, fixed, onto, the, propulsion, rope, and, cannot, be, decoupled, from, it, during, operations, in, comparison, to, gondola, lifts, aerial, tramways, generally, provide, lower, line, capacities, and, higher, wait, times, cable, car, is, the, usual, term, in, british, english, where, tramway, generally, refers, to, a, railed, street, tramway, in, american, english, cable, car, may, additionally, refer, to, a, cable, pulled, street, tramway, with, detachable, vehicles, e, g, san, francisco, s, cable, cars, as, such, careful, phrasing, is, necessary, to, prevent, confusion, it, is, also, sometimes, called, a, ropeway, or, even, incorrectly, referred, to, as, a, gondola, lift, a, gondola, lift, has, cabins, suspended, from, a, continuously, circulating, cable, whereas, aerial, trams, simply, shuttle, back, and, forth, on, cables, in, japan, the, two, are, considered, as, the, same, category, of, vehicle, and, called, ropeway, while, the, term, cable, car, refers, to, both, grounded, cable, cars, and, funiculars, an, aerial, railway, where, the, vehicles, are, suspended, from, a, fixed, track, as, opposed, to, a, cable, is, known, as, a, suspension, railway, an, aerial, tramway, consists, of, one, or, two, fixed, cables, called, track, cables, one, loop, of, cable, called, a, haulage, rope, and, one, or, two, passenger, or, cargo, cabins, the, fixed, cables, provide, support, for, the, cabins, while, the, haulage, rope, by, means, of, a, grip, is, solidly, connected, to, the, truck, the, wheel, set, that, rolls, on, the, track, cables, an, electric, motor, drives, the, haulage, rope, which, provides, propulsion, aerial, tramways, are, constructed, as, reversible, systems, vehicles, shuttling, back, and, forth, between, two, end, terminals, and, propelled, by, a, cable, loop, which, stops, and, reverses, direction, when, the, cabins, arrive, at, the, end, stations, aerial, tramways, differ, from, gondola, lifts, in, that, gondola, lifts, are, considered, continuous, systems, cabins, attached, onto, a, circulating, haul, rope, that, moves, continuously, two, car, tramways, use, a, jig, back, system, a, large, electric, motor, is, located, at, the, bottom, of, the, tramway, so, that, it, effectively, pulls, one, cabin, down, using, that, cabin, s, weight, to, help, pull, the, other, cabin, up, a, similar, system, of, cables, is, used, in, a, funicular, railway, the, two, passenger, or, cargo, cabins, which, carry, from, 4, to, over, 150, people, are, situated, at, opposite, ends, of, the, loops, of, cable, thus, while, one, is, coming, up, the, other, is, going, down, the, mountain, and, they, pass, each, other, midway, on, the, cable, span, some, aerial, trams, have, only, one, cabin, which, lends, itself, better, for, systems, with, small, elevation, changes, along, the, cable, run, the, first, design, of, an, aerial, lift, was, by, croatian, polymath, fausto, veranzio, and, the, first, operational, aerial, tram, was, built, in, 1644, by, adam, wybe, in, gda, sk, poland, it, was, moved, by, horses, and, used, to, move, soil, over, the, river, to, build, defences, it, is, called, the, first, known, cable, lift, in, european, history, and, precedes, the, invention, of, steel, cables, it, is, not, known, how, long, this, lift, was, used, in, any, case, it, would, be, another, 230, years, before, germany, would, get, the, second, cable, lift, this, newer, version, equipped, with, iron, wire, cable, tramways, are, sometimes, used, in, mountainous, regions, to, carry, ore, from, a, mine, located, high, on, the, mountain, to, an, ore, mill, located, at, a, lower, elevation, ore, tramways, were, common, in, the, early, 20th, century, at, the, mines, in, north, and, south, america, one, can, still, be, seen, in, the, san, juan, mountains, of, the, us, state, of, colorado, another, famous, use, of, aerial, tramways, was, at, the, kennecott, copper, mine, in, wrangell, st, elias, national, park, alaska, other, firms, entered, the, mining, tramway, business, otto, leschen, breco, ropeways, ltd, ceretti, and, tanfani, and, riblet, for, instance, a, major, british, contributor, was, bullivant, who, became, a, constituent, of, british, ropes, in, 1924, in, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, rise, of, the, middle, class, and, the, leisure, industry, allowed, for, investment, in, sight, seeing, machines, prior, to, 1893, a, combined, goods, and, passenger, carrying, cableway, was, installed, at, gibraltar, initially, its, passengers, were, military, personnel, an, 1893, industry, publication, said, of, a, two, mile, system, in, hong, kong, that, it, is, the, only, wire, tramway, which, has, been, erected, exclusively, for, the, carriage, of, individuals, albeit, workmen, after, the, pioneer, cable, car, suitable, for, public, transport, on, mount, ulia, in, 1907, san, sebasti, n, spain, by, leonardo, torres, quevedo, and, the, wetterhorn, elevator, grindelwald, switzerland, in, 1908, others, to, the, top, of, high, peaks, in, the, alps, of, austria, germany, and, switzerland, resulted, they, were, much, less, expensive, to, build, than, the, earlier, rack, railway, one, of, the, first, trams, was, at, chamonix, while, others, in, switzerland, and, garmisch, soon, followed, from, this, it, was, a, natural, transposition, to, build, ski, lifts, and, chairlifts, the, first, cable, car, in, north, america, was, at, cannon, mountain, in, franconia, new, hampshire, in, 1938, many, aerial, tramways, were, built, by, von, roll, ltd, of, switzerland, which, has, since, been, acquired, by, austrian, lift, manufacturer, doppelmayr, other, german, swiss, and, austrian, firms, played, an, important, role, in, the, cable, car, business, bleichert, heckel, pohlig, phb, pohlig, heckel, bleichert, garaventa, and, waagner, bir, now, there, are, three, groups, dominating, the, world, market, doppelmayr, garaventa, group, leitner, group, and, poma, the, last, two, being, owned, by, one, person, some, aerial, tramways, have, their, own, propulsion, such, as, the, lasso, mule, or, the, josef, mountain, aerial, tramway, near, merano, italy, while, typically, used, for, ski, resorts, aerial, tramways, have, been, ported, over, for, usage, in, the, urban, environment, in, recent, times, the, roosevelt, island, tramway, in, new, york, city, the, rakavlit, cable, car, in, haifa, israel, and, the, portland, aerial, tram, are, examples, where, this, technology, has, been, successfully, adapted, for, public, transport, purposes, the, telpherage, concept, was, first, publicised, in, 1883, and, several, experimental, lines, were, constructed, it, was, designed, to, compete, not, with, railways, but, with, horses, and, carts, the, first, commercial, telpherage, line, was, in, glynde, which, is, in, sussex, england, it, was, built, to, connect, a, newly, opened, clay, pit, to, the, local, railway, station, and, opened, in, 1885, there, are, aerial, tramways, with, double, deck, cabins, the, vanoise, express, cable, car, carries, 200, people, in, each, cabin, at, a, height, of, 380, m, 1, 247, ft, over, the, ponturin, gorge, in, france, the, shinhotaka, ropeway, carries, 121, people, in, each, cabin, at, mount, hotaka, in, japan, the, cabrio, cable, car, to, the, summit, of, the, stanserhorn, in, switzerland, carries, 60, persons, with, the, upper, floor, accommodating, 30, people, in, the, open, air, despite, the, introduction, of, various, safety, measures, back, up, power, generators, evacuation, plans, etc, there, have, been, several, serious, incidents, on, aerial, tramways, some, of, which, were, fatal
