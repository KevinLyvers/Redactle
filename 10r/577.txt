sonar, sound, navigation, and, ranging, or, sonic, navigation, and, ranging, is, a, technique, that, uses, sound, propagation, usually, underwater, as, in, submarine, navigation, to, navigate, measure, distances, ranging, communicate, with, or, detect, objects, on, or, under, the, surface, of, the, water, such, as, other, vessels, sonar, can, refer, to, one, of, two, types, of, technology, passive, sonar, means, listening, for, the, sound, made, by, vessels, active, sonar, means, emitting, pulses, of, sounds, and, listening, for, echoes, sonar, may, be, used, as, a, means, of, acoustic, location, and, of, measurement, of, the, echo, characteristics, of, targets, in, the, water, acoustic, location, in, air, was, used, before, the, introduction, of, radar, sonar, may, also, be, used, for, robot, navigation, and, sodar, an, upward, looking, in, air, sonar, is, used, for, atmospheric, investigations, the, term, sonar, is, also, used, for, the, equipment, used, to, generate, and, receive, the, sound, the, acoustic, frequencies, used, in, sonar, systems, vary, from, very, low, infrasonic, to, extremely, high, ultrasonic, the, study, of, underwater, sound, is, known, as, underwater, acoustics, or, hydroacoustics, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, technique, was, in, 1490, by, leonardo, da, vinci, who, used, a, tube, inserted, into, the, water, to, detect, vessels, by, ear, it, was, developed, during, world, war, i, to, counter, the, growing, threat, of, submarine, warfare, with, an, operational, passive, sonar, system, in, use, by, 1918, modern, active, sonar, systems, use, an, acoustic, transducer, to, generate, a, sound, wave, which, is, reflected, from, target, objects, although, some, animals, dolphins, bats, some, shrews, and, others, have, used, sound, for, communication, and, object, detection, for, millions, of, years, use, by, humans, in, the, water, was, initially, recorded, by, leonardo, da, vinci, in, 1490, a, tube, inserted, into, the, water, was, said, to, be, used, to, detect, vessels, by, placing, an, ear, to, the, tube, in, the, late, 19th, century, an, underwater, bell, was, used, as, an, ancillary, to, lighthouses, or, lightships, to, provide, warning, of, hazards, the, use, of, sound, to, echo, locate, underwater, in, the, same, way, as, bats, use, sound, for, aerial, navigation, seems, to, have, been, prompted, by, the, titanic, disaster, of, 1912, the, world, s, first, patent, for, an, underwater, echo, ranging, device, was, filed, at, the, british, patent, office, by, english, meteorologist, lewis, fry, richardson, a, month, after, the, sinking, of, titanic, and, a, german, physicist, alexander, behm, obtained, a, patent, for, an, echo, sounder, in, 1913, the, canadian, engineer, reginald, fessenden, while, working, for, the, submarine, signal, company, in, boston, massachusetts, built, an, experimental, system, beginning, in, 1912, a, system, later, tested, in, boston, harbor, and, finally, in, 1914, from, the, u, s, revenue, cutter, miami, on, the, grand, banks, off, newfoundland, in, that, test, fessenden, demonstrated, depth, sounding, underwater, communications, morse, code, and, echo, ranging, detecting, an, iceberg, at, a, 2, mile, 3, 2, km, range, the, fessenden, oscillator, operated, at, about, 500, hz, frequency, was, unable, to, determine, the, bearing, of, the, iceberg, due, to, the, 3, metre, wavelength, and, the, small, dimension, of, the, transducer, s, radiating, face, less, than, 1, 3, wavelength, in, diameter, the, ten, montreal, built, british, h, class, submarines, launched, in, 1915, were, equipped, with, fessenden, oscillators, during, world, war, i, the, need, to, detect, submarines, prompted, more, research, into, the, use, of, sound, the, british, made, early, use, of, underwater, listening, devices, called, hydrophones, while, the, french, physicist, paul, langevin, working, with, a, russian, immigrant, electrical, engineer, constantin, chilowsky, worked, on, the, development, of, active, sound, devices, for, detecting, submarines, in, 1915, although, piezoelectric, and, magnetostrictive, transducers, later, superseded, the, electrostatic, transducers, they, used, this, work, influenced, future, designs, lightweight, sound, sensitive, plastic, film, and, fibre, optics, have, been, used, for, hydrophones, while, terfenol, d, and, lead, magnesium, niobate, pmn, have, been, developed, for, projectors, in, 1916, under, the, british, board, of, invention, and, research, canadian, physicist, robert, william, boyle, took, on, the, active, sound, detection, project, with, a, b, wood, producing, a, prototype, for, testing, in, mid, 1917, this, work, for, the, anti, submarine, division, of, the, british, naval, staff, was, undertaken, in, utmost, secrecy, and, used, quartz, piezoelectric, crystals, to, produce, the, world, s, first, practical, underwater, active, sound, detection, apparatus, to, maintain, secrecy, no, mention, of, sound, experimentation, or, quartz, was, made, the, word, used, to, describe, the, early, work, supersonics, was, changed, to, asd, ics, and, the, quartz, material, to, asd, ivite, asd, for, anti, submarine, division, hence, the, british, acronym, asdic, in, 1939, in, response, to, a, question, from, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, admiralty, made, up, the, story, that, it, stood, for, allied, submarine, detection, investigation, committee, and, this, is, still, widely, believed, though, no, committee, bearing, this, name, has, been, found, in, the, admiralty, archives, by, 1918, britain, and, france, had, built, prototype, active, systems, the, british, tested, their, asdic, on, hms, antrim, in, 1920, and, started, production, in, 1922, the, 6th, destroyer, flotilla, had, asdic, equipped, vessels, in, 1923, an, anti, submarine, school, hms, osprey, and, a, training, flotilla, of, four, vessels, were, established, on, portland, in, 1924, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, the, royal, navy, had, five, sets, for, different, surface, ship, classes, and, others, for, submarines, incorporated, into, a, complete, anti, submarine, system, the, effectiveness, of, early, asdic, was, hampered, by, the, use, of, the, depth, charge, as, an, anti, submarine, weapon, this, required, an, attacking, vessel, to, pass, over, a, submerged, contact, before, dropping, charges, over, the, stern, resulting, in, a, loss, of, asdic, contact, in, the, moments, leading, up, to, attack, the, hunter, was, effectively, firing, blind, during, which, time, a, submarine, commander, could, take, evasive, action, this, situation, was, remedied, with, new, tactics, and, new, weapons, the, tactical, improvements, developed, by, frederic, john, walker, included, the, creeping, attack, two, anti, submarine, ships, were, needed, for, this, usually, sloops, or, corvettes, the, directing, ship, tracked, the, target, submarine, on, asdic, from, a, position, about, 1500, to, 2000, yards, behind, the, submarine, the, second, ship, with, her, asdic, turned, off, and, running, at, 5, knots, started, an, attack, from, a, position, between, the, directing, ship, and, the, target, this, attack, was, controlled, by, radio, telephone, from, the, directing, ship, based, on, their, asdic, and, the, range, by, rangefinder, and, bearing, of, the, attacking, ship, as, soon, as, the, depth, charges, had, been, released, the, attacking, ship, left, the, immediate, area, at, full, speed, the, directing, ship, then, entered, the, target, area, and, also, released, a, pattern, of, depth, charges, the, low, speed, of, the, approach, meant, the, submarine, could, not, predict, when, depth, charges, were, going, to, be, released, any, evasive, action, was, detected, by, the, directing, ship, and, steering, orders, to, the, attacking, ship, given, accordingly, the, low, speed, of, the, attack, had, the, advantage, that, the, german, acoustic, torpedo, was, not, effective, against, a, warship, travelling, so, slowly, a, variation, of, the, creeping, attack, was, the, plaster, attack, in, which, three, attacking, ships, working, in, a, close, line, abreast, were, directed, over, the, target, by, the, directing, ship, the, new, weapons, to, deal, with, the, asdic, blind, spot, were, ahead, throwing, weapons, such, as, hedgehogs, and, later, squids, which, projected, warheads, at, a, target, ahead, of, the, attacker, and, still, in, asdic, contact, these, allowed, a, single, escort, to, make, better, aimed, attacks, on, submarines, developments, during, the, war, resulted, in, british, asdic, sets, that, used, several, different, shapes, of, beam, continuously, covering, blind, spots, later, acoustic, torpedoes, were, used, early, in, world, war, ii, september, 1940, british, asdic, technology, was, transferred, for, free, to, the, united, states, research, on, asdic, and, underwater, sound, was, expanded, in, the, uk, and, in, the, us, many, new, types, of, military, sound, detection, were, developed, these, included, sonobuoys, first, developed, by, the, british, in, 1944, under, the, codename, high, tea, dipping, dunking, sonar, and, mine, detection, sonar, this, work, formed, the, basis, for, post, war, developments, related, to, countering, the, nuclear, submarine, during, the, 1930s, american, engineers, developed, their, own, underwater, sound, detection, technology, and, important, discoveries, were, made, such, as, the, existence, of, thermoclines, and, their, effects, on, sound, waves, americans, began, to, use, the, term, sonar, for, their, systems, coined, by, frederick, hunt, to, be, the, equivalent, of, radar, in, 1917, the, us, navy, acquired, j, warren, horton, s, services, for, the, first, time, on, leave, from, bell, labs, he, served, the, government, as, a, technical, expert, first, at, the, experimental, station, at, nahant, massachusetts, and, later, at, us, naval, headquarters, in, london, england, at, nahant, he, applied, the, newly, developed, vacuum, tube, then, associated, with, the, formative, stages, of, the, field, of, applied, science, now, known, as, electronics, to, the, detection, of, underwater, signals, as, a, result, the, carbon, button, microphone, which, had, been, used, in, earlier, detection, equipment, was, replaced, by, the, precursor, of, the, modern, hydrophone, also, during, this, period, he, experimented, with, methods, for, towing, detection, this, was, due, to, the, increased, sensitivity, of, his, device, the, principles, are, still, used, in, modern, towed, sonar, systems, to, meet, the, defense, needs, of, great, britain, he, was, sent, to, england, to, install, in, the, irish, sea, bottom, mounted, hydrophones, connected, to, a, shore, listening, post, by, submarine, cable, while, this, equipment, was, being, loaded, on, the, cable, laying, vessel, world, war, i, ended, and, horton, returned, home, during, world, war, ii, he, continued, to, develop, sonar, systems, that, could, detect, submarines, mines, and, torpedoes, he, published, fundamentals, of, sonar, in, 1957, as, chief, research, consultant, at, the, us, navy, underwater, sound, laboratory, he, held, this, position, until, 1959, when, he, became, technical, director, a, position, he, held, until, mandatory, retirement, in, 1963, there, was, little, progress, in, us, sonar, from, 1915, to, 1940, in, 1940, us, sonars, typically, consisted, of, a, magnetostrictive, transducer, and, an, array, of, nickel, tubes, connected, to, a, 1, foot, diameter, steel, plate, attached, back, to, back, to, a, rochelle, salt, crystal, in, a, spherical, housing, this, assembly, penetrated, the, ship, hull, and, was, manually, rotated, to, the, desired, angle, the, piezoelectric, rochelle, salt, crystal, had, better, parameters, but, the, magnetostrictive, unit, was, much, more, reliable, high, losses, to, us, merchant, supply, shipping, early, in, world, war, ii, led, to, large, scale, high, priority, us, research, in, the, field, pursuing, both, improvements, in, magnetostrictive, transducer, parameters, and, rochelle, salt, reliability, ammonium, dihydrogen, phosphate, adp, a, superior, alternative, was, found, as, a, replacement, for, rochelle, salt, the, first, application, was, a, replacement, of, the, 24, khz, rochelle, salt, transducers, within, nine, months, rochelle, salt, was, obsolete, the, adp, manufacturing, facility, grew, from, few, dozen, personnel, in, early, 1940, to, several, thousands, in, 1942, one, of, the, earliest, application, of, adp, crystals, were, hydrophones, for, acoustic, mines, the, crystals, were, specified, for, low, frequency, cutoff, at, 5, hz, withstanding, mechanical, shock, for, deployment, from, aircraft, from, 3, 000, m, 10, 000, ft, and, ability, to, survive, neighbouring, mine, explosions, one, of, key, features, of, adp, reliability, is, its, zero, aging, characteristics, the, crystal, keeps, its, parameters, even, over, prolonged, storage, another, application, was, for, acoustic, homing, torpedoes, two, pairs, of, directional, hydrophones, were, mounted, on, the, torpedo, nose, in, the, horizontal, and, vertical, plane, the, difference, signals, from, the, pairs, were, used, to, steer, the, torpedo, left, right, and, up, down, a, countermeasure, was, developed, the, targeted, submarine, discharged, an, effervescent, chemical, and, the, torpedo, went, after, the, noisier, fizzy, decoy, the, counter, countermeasure, was, a, torpedo, with, active, sonar, a, transducer, was, added, to, the, torpedo, nose, and, the, microphones, were, listening, for, its, reflected, periodic, tone, bursts, the, transducers, comprised, identical, rectangular, crystal, plates, arranged, to, diamond, shaped, areas, in, staggered, rows, passive, sonar, arrays, for, submarines, were, developed, from, adp, crystals, several, crystal, assemblies, were, arranged, in, a, steel, tube, vacuum, filled, with, castor, oil, and, sealed, the, tubes, then, were, mounted, in, parallel, arrays, the, standard, us, navy, scanning, sonar, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, operated, at, 18, khz, using, an, array, of, adp, crystals, desired, longer, range, however, required, use, of, lower, frequencies, the, required, dimensions, were, too, big, for, adp, crystals, so, in, the, early, 1950s, magnetostrictive, and, barium, titanate, piezoelectric, systems, were, developed, but, these, had, problems, achieving, uniform, impedance, characteristics, and, the, beam, pattern, suffered, barium, titanate, was, then, replaced, with, more, stable, lead, zirconate, titanate, pzt, and, the, frequency, was, lowered, to, 5, khz, the, us, fleet, used, this, material, in, the, an, sqs, 23, sonar, for, several, decades, the, sqs, 23, sonar, first, used, magnetostrictive, nickel, transducers, but, these, weighed, several, tons, and, nickel, was, expensive, and, considered, a, critical, material, piezoelectric, transducers, were, therefore, substituted, the, sonar, was, a, large, array, of, 432, individual, transducers, at, first, the, transducers, were, unreliable, showing, mechanical, and, electrical, failures, and, deteriorating, soon, after, installation, they, were, also, produced, by, several, vendors, had, different, designs, and, their, characteristics, were, different, enough, to, impair, the, array, s, performance, the, policy, to, allow, repair, of, individual, transducers, was, then, sacrificed, and, expendable, modular, design, sealed, non, repairable, modules, was, chosen, instead, eliminating, the, problem, with, seals, and, other, extraneous, mechanical, parts, the, imperial, japanese, navy, at, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, used, projectors, based, on, quartz, these, were, big, and, heavy, especially, if, designed, for, lower, frequencies, the, one, for, type, 91, set, operating, at, 9, khz, had, a, diameter, of, 30, inches, 760, mm, and, was, driven, by, an, oscillator, with, 5, kw, power, and, 7, kv, of, output, amplitude, the, type, 93, projectors, consisted, of, solid, sandwiches, of, quartz, assembled, into, spherical, cast, iron, bodies, the, type, 93, sonars, were, later, replaced, with, type, 3, which, followed, german, design, and, used, magnetostrictive, projectors, the, projectors, consisted, of, two, rectangular, identical, independent, units, in, a, cast, iron, rectangular, body, about, 16, by, 9, inches, 410, mm, 230, mm, the, exposed, area, was, half, the, wavelength, wide, and, three, wavelengths, high, the, magnetostrictive, cores, were, made, from, 4, mm, stampings, of, nickel, and, later, of, an, iron, aluminium, alloy, with, aluminium, content, between, 12, 7, and, 12, 9, the, power, was, provided, from, a, 2, kw, at, 3, 8, kv, with, polarization, from, a, 20, v, 8, a, dc, source, the, passive, hydrophones, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, were, based, on, moving, coil, design, rochelle, salt, piezo, transducers, and, carbon, microphones, magnetostrictive, transducers, were, pursued, after, world, war, ii, as, an, alternative, to, piezoelectric, ones, nickel, scroll, wound, ring, transducers, were, used, for, high, power, low, frequency, operations, with, size, up, to, 13, feet, 4, 0, m, in, diameter, probably, the, largest, individual, sonar, transducers, ever, the, advantage, of, metals, is, their, high, tensile, strength, and, low, input, electrical, impedance, but, they, have, electrical, losses, and, lower, coupling, coefficient, than, pzt, whose, tensile, strength, can, be, increased, by, prestressing, other, materials, were, also, tried, nonmetallic, ferrites, were, promising, for, their, low, electrical, conductivity, resulting, in, low, eddy, current, losses, metglas, offered, high, coupling, coefficient, but, they, were, inferior, to, pzt, overall, in, the, 1970s, compounds, of, rare, earths, and, iron, were, discovered, with, superior, magnetomechanic, properties, namely, the, terfenol, d, alloy, this, made, possible, new, designs, e, g, a, hybrid, magnetostrictive, piezoelectric, transducer, the, most, recent, of, these, improved, magnetostrictive, materials, is, galfenol, other, types, of, transducers, include, variable, reluctance, or, moving, armature, or, electromagnetic, transducers, where, magnetic, force, acts, on, the, surfaces, of, gaps, and, moving, coil, or, electrodynamic, transducers, similar, to, conventional, speakers, the, latter, are, used, in, underwater, sound, calibration, due, to, their, very, low, resonance, frequencies, and, flat, broadband, characteristics, above, them, active, sonar, uses, a, sound, transmitter, or, projector, and, a, receiver, when, the, two, are, in, the, same, place, it, is, monostatic, operation, when, the, transmitter, and, receiver, are, separated, it, is, bistatic, operation, when, more, transmitters, or, more, receivers, are, used, again, spatially, separated, it, is, multistatic, operation, most, sonars, are, used, monostatically, with, the, same, array, often, being, used, for, transmission, and, reception, active, sonobuoy, fields, may, be, operated, multistatically, active, sonar, creates, a, pulse, of, sound, often, called, a, ping, and, then, listens, for, reflections, echo, of, the, pulse, this, pulse, of, sound, is, generally, created, electronically, using, a, sonar, projector, consisting, of, a, signal, generator, power, amplifier, and, electro, acoustic, transducer, array, a, transducer, is, a, device, that, can, transmit, and, receive, acoustic, signals, pings, a, beamformer, is, usually, employed, to, concentrate, the, acoustic, power, into, a, beam, which, may, be, swept, to, cover, the, required, search, angles, generally, the, electro, acoustic, transducers, are, of, the, tonpilz, type, and, their, design, may, be, optimised, to, achieve, maximum, efficiency, over, the, widest, bandwidth, in, order, to, optimise, performance, of, the, overall, system, occasionally, the, acoustic, pulse, may, be, created, by, other, means, e, g, chemically, using, explosives, airguns, or, plasma, sound, sources, to, measure, the, distance, to, an, object, the, time, from, transmission, of, a, pulse, to, reception, is, measured, and, converted, into, a, range, using, the, known, speed, of, sound, to, measure, the, bearing, several, hydrophones, are, used, and, the, set, measures, the, relative, arrival, time, to, each, or, with, an, array, of, hydrophones, by, measuring, the, relative, amplitude, in, beams, formed, through, a, process, called, beamforming, use, of, an, array, reduces, the, spatial, response, so, that, to, provide, wide, cover, multibeam, systems, are, used, the, target, signal, if, present, together, with, noise, is, then, passed, through, various, forms, of, signal, processing, which, for, simple, sonars, may, be, just, energy, measurement, it, is, then, presented, to, some, form, of, decision, device, that, calls, the, output, either, the, required, signal, or, noise, this, decision, device, may, be, an, operator, with, headphones, or, a, display, or, in, more, sophisticated, sonars, this, function, may, be, carried, out, by, software, further, processes, may, be, carried, out, to, classify, the, target, and, localise, it, as, well, as, measuring, its, velocity, the, pulse, may, be, at, constant, frequency, or, a, chirp, of, changing, frequency, to, allow, pulse, compression, on, reception, simple, sonars, generally, use, the, former, with, a, filter, wide, enough, to, cover, possible, doppler, changes, due, to, target, movement, while, more, complex, ones, generally, include, the, latter, technique, since, digital, processing, became, available, pulse, compression, has, usually, been, implemented, using, digital, correlation, techniques, military, sonars, often, have, multiple, beams, to, provide, all, round, cover, while, simple, ones, only, cover, a, narrow, arc, although, the, beam, may, be, rotated, relatively, slowly, by, mechanical, scanning, particularly, when, single, frequency, transmissions, are, used, the, doppler, effect, can, be, used, to, measure, the, radial, speed, of, a, target, the, difference, in, frequency, between, the, transmitted, and, received, signal, is, measured, and, converted, into, a, velocity, since, doppler, shifts, can, be, introduced, by, either, receiver, or, target, motion, allowance, has, to, be, made, for, the, radial, speed, of, the, searching, platform, one, useful, small, sonar, is, similar, in, appearance, to, a, waterproof, flashlight, the, head, is, pointed, into, the, water, a, button, is, pressed, and, the, device, displays, the, distance, to, the, target, another, variant, is, a, fishfinder, that, shows, a, small, display, with, shoals, of, fish, some, civilian, sonars, which, are, not, designed, for, stealth, approach, active, military, sonars, in, capability, with, three, dimensional, displays, of, the, area, near, the, boat, when, active, sonar, is, used, to, measure, the, distance, from, the, transducer, to, the, bottom, it, is, known, as, echo, sounding, similar, methods, may, be, used, looking, upward, for, wave, measurement, active, sonar, is, also, used, to, measure, distance, through, water, between, two, sonar, transducers, or, a, combination, of, a, hydrophone, underwater, acoustic, microphone, and, projector, underwater, acoustic, speaker, when, a, hydrophone, transducer, receives, a, specific, interrogation, signal, it, responds, by, transmitting, a, specific, reply, signal, to, measure, distance, one, transducer, projector, transmits, an, interrogation, signal, and, measures, the, time, between, this, transmission, and, the, receipt, of, the, other, transducer, hydrophone, reply, the, time, difference, scaled, by, the, speed, of, sound, through, water, and, divided, by, two, is, the, distance, between, the, two, platforms, this, technique, when, used, with, multiple, transducers, hydrophones, projectors, can, calculate, the, relative, positions, of, static, and, moving, objects, in, water, in, combat, situations, an, active, pulse, can, be, detected, by, an, enemy, and, will, reveal, a, submarine, s, position, at, twice, the, maximum, distance, that, the, submarine, can, itself, detect, a, contact, and, give, clues, as, to, the, submarine, s, identity, based, on, the, characteristics, of, the, outgoing, ping, for, these, reasons, active, sonar, is, not, frequently, used, by, military, submarines, a, very, directional, but, low, efficiency, type, of, sonar, used, by, fisheries, military, and, for, port, security, makes, use, of, a, complex, nonlinear, feature, of, water, known, as, non, linear, sonar, the, virtual, transducer, being, known, as, a, parametric, array, project, artemis, was, an, experimental, research, and, development, project, in, the, late, 1950s, to, mid, 1960s, to, examine, acoustic, propagation, and, signal, processing, for, a, low, frequency, active, sonar, system, that, might, be, used, for, ocean, surveillance, a, secondary, objective, was, examination, of, engineering, problems, of, fixed, active, bottom, systems, the, receiving, array, was, located, on, the, slope, of, plantagnet, bank, off, bermuda, the, active, source, array, was, deployed, from, the, converted, world, war, ii, tanker, usns, mission, capistrano, elements, of, artemis, were, used, experimentally, after, the, main, experiment, was, terminated, this, is, an, active, sonar, device, that, receives, a, specific, stimulus, and, immediately, or, with, a, delay, retransmits, the, received, signal, or, a, predetermined, one, transponders, can, be, used, to, remotely, activate, or, recover, subsea, equipment, a, sonar, target, is, small, relative, to, the, sphere, centred, around, the, emitter, on, which, it, is, located, therefore, the, power, of, the, reflected, signal, is, very, low, several, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, the, original, signal, even, if, the, reflected, signal, was, of, the, same, power, the, following, example, using, hypothetical, values, shows, the, problem, suppose, a, sonar, system, is, capable, of, emitting, a, 10, 000, w, m, 2, signal, at, 1, m, and, detecting, a, 0, 001, w, m, 2, signal, at, 100, m, the, signal, will, be, 1, w, m, 2, due, to, the, inverse, square, law, if, the, entire, signal, is, reflected, from, a, 10, m, 2, target, it, will, be, at, 0, 001, w, m, 2, when, it, reaches, the, emitter, i, e, just, detectable, however, the, original, signal, will, remain, above, 0, 001, w, m, 2, until, 3000, m, any, 10, m, 2, target, between, 100, and, 3000, m, using, a, similar, or, better, system, would, be, able, to, detect, the, pulse, but, would, not, be, detected, by, the, emitter, the, detectors, must, be, very, sensitive, to, pick, up, the, echoes, since, the, original, signal, is, much, more, powerful, it, can, be, detected, many, times, further, than, twice, the, range, of, the, sonar, as, in, the, example, active, sonar, have, two, performance, limitations, due, to, noise, and, reverberation, in, general, one, or, other, of, these, will, dominate, so, that, the, two, effects, can, be, initially, considered, separately, in, noise, limited, conditions, at, initial, detection, where, sl, is, the, source, level, pl, is, the, propagation, loss, sometimes, referred, to, as, transmission, loss, ts, is, the, target, strength, nl, is, the, noise, level, ag, is, the, array, gain, of, the, receiving, array, sometimes, approximated, by, its, directivity, index, and, dt, is, the, detection, threshold, in, reverberation, limited, conditions, at, initial, detection, neglecting, array, gain, where, rl, is, the, reverberation, level, and, the, other, factors, are, as, before, an, upward, looking, sonar, uls, is, a, sonar, device, pointed, upwards, looking, towards, the, surface, of, the, sea, it, is, used, for, similar, purposes, as, downward, looking, sonar, but, has, some, unique, applications, such, as, measuring, sea, ice, thickness, roughness, and, concentration, or, measuring, air, entrainment, from, bubble, plumes, during, rough, seas, often, it, is, moored, on, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, or, floats, on, a, taut, line, mooring, at, a, constant, depth, of, perhaps, 100, m, they, may, also, be, used, by, submarines, auvs, and, floats, such, as, the, argo, float, passive, sonar, listens, without, transmitting, it, is, often, employed, in, military, settings, although, it, is, also, used, in, science, applications, e, g, detecting, fish, for, presence, absence, studies, in, various, aquatic, environments, see, also, passive, acoustics, and, passive, radar, in, the, very, broadest, usage, this, term, can, encompass, virtually, any, analytical, technique, involving, remotely, generated, sound, though, it, is, usually, restricted, to, techniques, applied, in, an, aquatic, environment, passive, sonar, has, a, wide, variety, of, techniques, for, identifying, the, source, of, a, detected, sound, for, example, u, s, vessels, usually, operate, 60, hertz, hz, alternating, current, power, systems, if, transformers, or, generators, are, mounted, without, proper, vibration, insulation, from, the, hull, or, become, flooded, the, 60, hz, sound, from, the, windings, can, be, emitted, from, the, submarine, or, ship, this, can, help, to, identify, its, nationality, as, all, european, submarines, and, nearly, every, other, nation, s, submarine, have, 50, hz, power, systems, intermittent, sound, sources, such, as, a, wrench, being, dropped, called, transients, may, also, be, detectable, to, passive, sonar, until, fairly, recently, an, experienced, trained, operator, identified, signals, but, now, computers, may, do, this, passive, sonar, systems, may, have, large, sonic, databases, but, the, sonar, operator, usually, finally, classifies, the, signals, manually, a, computer, system, frequently, uses, these, databases, to, identify, classes, of, ships, actions, i, e, the, speed, of, a, ship, or, the, type, of, weapon, released, and, the, most, effective, countermeasures, to, employ, and, even, particular, ships, passive, sonar, on, vehicles, is, usually, severely, limited, because, of, noise, generated, by, the, vehicle, for, this, reason, many, submarines, operate, nuclear, reactors, that, can, be, cooled, without, pumps, using, silent, convection, or, fuel, cells, or, batteries, which, can, also, run, silently, vehicles, propellers, are, also, designed, and, precisely, machined, to, emit, minimal, noise, high, speed, propellers, often, create, tiny, bubbles, in, the, water, and, this, cavitation, has, a, distinct, sound, the, sonar, hydrophones, may, be, towed, behind, the, ship, or, submarine, in, order, to, reduce, the, effect, of, noise, generated, by, the, watercraft, itself, towed, units, also, combat, the, thermocline, as, the, unit, may, be, towed, above, or, below, the, thermocline, the, display, of, most, passive, sonars, used, to, be, a, two, dimensional, waterfall, display, the, horizontal, direction, of, the, display, is, bearing, the, vertical, is, frequency, or, sometimes, time, another, display, technique, is, to, color, code, frequency, time, information, for, bearing, more, recent, displays, are, generated, by, the, computers, and, mimic, radar, type, plan, position, indicator, displays, unlike, active, sonar, only, one, way, propagation, is, involved, because, of, the, different, signal, processing, used, the, minimal, detectable, signal, to, noise, ratio, will, be, different, the, equation, for, determining, the, performance, of, a, passive, sonar, is, where, sl, is, the, source, level, pl, is, the, propagation, loss, nl, is, the, noise, level, ag, is, the, array, gain, and, dt, is, the, detection, threshold, the, figure, of, merit, of, a, passive, sonar, is, the, detection, classification, and, localisation, performance, of, a, sonar, depends, on, the, environment, and, the, receiving, equipment, as, well, as, the, transmitting, equipment, in, an, active, sonar, or, the, target, radiated, noise, in, a, passive, sonar, sonar, operation, is, affected, by, variations, in, sound, speed, particularly, in, the, vertical, plane, sound, travels, more, slowly, in, fresh, water, than, in, sea, water, though, the, difference, is, small, the, speed, is, determined, by, the, water, s, bulk, modulus, and, mass, density, the, bulk, modulus, is, affected, by, temperature, dissolved, impurities, usually, salinity, and, pressure, the, density, effect, is, small, the, speed, of, sound, in, feet, per, second, is, approximately, this, empirically, derived, approximation, equation, is, reasonably, accurate, for, normal, temperatures, concentrations, of, salinity, and, the, range, of, most, ocean, depths, ocean, temperature, varies, with, depth, but, at, between, 30, and, 100, meters, there, is, often, a, marked, change, called, the, thermocline, dividing, the, warmer, surface, water, from, the, cold, still, waters, that, make, up, the, rest, of, the, ocean, this, can, frustrate, sonar, because, a, sound, originating, on, one, side, of, the, thermocline, tends, to, be, bent, or, refracted, through, the, thermocline, the, thermocline, may, be, present, in, shallower, coastal, waters, however, wave, action, will, often, mix, the, water, column, and, eliminate, the, thermocline, water, pressure, also, affects, sound, propagation, higher, pressure, increases, the, sound, speed, which, causes, the, sound, waves, to, refract, away, from, the, area, of, higher, sound, speed, the, mathematical, model, of, refraction, is, called, snell, s, law, if, the, sound, source, is, deep, and, the, conditions, are, right, propagation, may, occur, in, the, deep, sound, channel, this, provides, extremely, low, propagation, loss, to, a, receiver, in, the, channel, this, is, because, of, sound, trapping, in, the, channel, with, no, losses, at, the, boundaries, similar, propagation, can, occur, in, the, surface, duct, under, suitable, conditions, however, in, this, case, there, are, reflection, losses, at, the, surface, in, shallow, water, propagation, is, generally, by, repeated, reflection, at, the, surface, and, bottom, where, considerable, losses, can, occur, sound, propagation, is, affected, by, absorption, in, the, water, itself, as, well, as, at, the, surface, and, bottom, this, absorption, depends, upon, frequency, with, several, different, mechanisms, in, sea, water, long, range, sonar, uses, low, frequencies, to, minimise, absorption, effects, the, sea, contains, many, sources, of, noise, that, interfere, with, the, desired, target, echo, or, signature, the, main, noise, sources, are, waves, and, shipping, the, motion, of, the, receiver, through, the, water, can, also, cause, speed, dependent, low, frequency, noise, when, active, sonar, is, used, scattering, occurs, from, small, objects, in, the, sea, as, well, as, from, the, bottom, and, surface, this, can, be, a, major, source, of, interference, this, acoustic, scattering, is, analogous, to, the, scattering, of, the, light, from, a, car, s, headlights, in, fog, a, high, intensity, pencil, beam, will, penetrate, the, fog, to, some, extent, but, broader, beam, headlights, emit, much, light, in, unwanted, directions, much, of, which, is, scattered, back, to, the, observer, overwhelming, that, reflected, from, the, target, white, out, for, analogous, reasons, active, sonar, needs, to, transmit, in, a, narrow, beam, to, minimize, scattering, the, scattering, of, sonar, from, objects, mines, pipelines, zooplankton, geological, features, fish, etc, is, how, active, sonar, detects, them, but, this, ability, can, be, masked, by, strong, scattering, from, false, targets, or, clutter, where, they, occur, under, breaking, waves, in, ship, wakes, in, gas, emitted, from, seabed, seeps, and, leaks, etc, gas, bubbles, are, powerful, sources, of, clutter, and, can, readily, hide, targets, twips, twin, inverted, pulse, sonar, is, currently, the, only, sonar, that, can, overcome, this, clutter, problem, this, is, important, as, many, recent, conflicts, have, occurred, in, coastal, waters, and, the, inability, to, detect, whether, mines, are, present, or, not, present, hazards, and, delays, to, military, vessels, and, also, to, aid, convoys, and, merchant, shipping, trying, to, support, the, region, long, after, the, conflict, has, ceased, the, sound, reflection, characteristics, of, the, target, of, an, active, sonar, such, as, a, submarine, are, known, as, its, target, strength, a, complication, is, that, echoes, are, also, obtained, from, other, objects, in, the, sea, such, as, whales, wakes, schools, of, fish, and, rocks, passive, sonar, detects, the, target, s, radiated, noise, characteristics, the, radiated, spectrum, comprises, a, continuous, spectrum, of, noise, with, peaks, at, certain, frequencies, which, can, be, used, for, classification, active, powered, countermeasures, may, be, launched, by, a, vessel, under, attack, to, raise, the, noise, level, provide, a, large, false, target, and, obscure, the, signature, of, the, vessel, itself, passive, i, e, non, powered, countermeasures, include, modern, naval, warfare, makes, extensive, use, of, both, passive, and, active, sonar, from, water, borne, vessels, aircraft, and, fixed, installations, although, active, sonar, was, used, by, surface, craft, in, world, war, ii, submarines, avoided, the, use, of, active, sonar, due, to, the, potential, for, revealing, their, presence, and, position, to, enemy, forces, however, the, advent, of, modern, signal, processing, enabled, the, use, of, passive, sonar, as, a, primary, means, for, search, and, detection, operations, in, 1987, a, division, of, japanese, company, toshiba, reportedly, sold, machinery, to, the, soviet, union, that, allowed, their, submarine, propeller, blades, to, be, milled, so, that, they, became, radically, quieter, making, the, newer, generation, of, submarines, more, difficult, to, detect, the, use, of, active, sonar, by, a, submarine, to, determine, bearing, is, extremely, rare, and, will, not, necessarily, give, high, quality, bearing, or, range, information, to, the, submarines, fire, control, team, however, use, of, active, sonar, on, surface, ships, is, very, common, and, is, used, by, submarines, when, the, tactical, situation, dictates, that, it, is, more, important, to, determine, the, position, of, a, hostile, submarine, than, conceal, their, own, position, with, surface, ships, it, might, be, assumed, that, the, threat, is, already, tracking, the, ship, with, satellite, data, as, any, vessel, around, the, emitting, sonar, will, detect, the, emission, having, heard, the, signal, it, is, easy, to, identify, the, sonar, equipment, used, usually, with, its, frequency, and, its, position, with, the, sound, wave, s, energy, active, sonar, is, similar, to, radar, in, that, while, it, allows, detection, of, targets, at, a, certain, range, it, also, enables, the, emitter, to, be, detected, at, a, far, greater, range, which, is, undesirable, since, active, sonar, reveals, the, presence, and, position, of, the, operator, and, does, not, allow, exact, classification, of, targets, it, is, used, by, fast, planes, helicopters, and, by, noisy, platforms, most, surface, ships, but, rarely, by, submarines, when, active, sonar, is, used, by, surface, ships, or, submarines, it, is, typically, activated, very, briefly, at, intermittent, periods, to, minimize, the, risk, of, detection, consequently, active, sonar, is, normally, considered, a, backup, to, passive, sonar, in, aircraft, active, sonar, is, used, in, the, form, of, disposable, sonobuoys, that, are, dropped, in, the, aircraft, s, patrol, area, or, in, the, vicinity, of, possible, enemy, sonar, contacts, passive, sonar, has, several, advantages, most, importantly, that, it, is, silent, if, the, target, radiated, noise, level, is, high, enough, it, can, have, a, greater, range, than, active, sonar, and, allows, the, target, to, be, identified, since, any, motorized, object, makes, some, noise, it, may, in, principle, be, detected, depending, on, the, level, of, noise, emitted, and, the, ambient, noise, level, in, the, area, as, well, as, the, technology, used, to, simplify, passive, sonar, sees, around, the, ship, using, it, on, a, submarine, nose, mounted, passive, sonar, detects, in, directions, of, about, 270, centered, on, the, ship, s, alignment, the, hull, mounted, array, of, about, 160, on, each, side, and, the, towed, array, of, a, full, 360, the, invisible, areas, are, due, to, the, ship, s, own, interference, once, a, signal, is, detected, in, a, certain, direction, which, means, that, something, makes, sound, in, that, direction, this, is, called, broadband, detection, it, is, possible, to, zoom, in, and, analyze, the, signal, received, narrowband, analysis, this, is, generally, done, using, a, fourier, transform, to, show, the, different, frequencies, making, up, the, sound, since, every, engine, makes, a, specific, sound, it, is, straightforward, to, identify, the, object, databases, of, unique, engine, sounds, are, part, of, what, is, known, as, acoustic, intelligence, or, acint, another, use, of, passive, sonar, is, to, determine, the, target, s, trajectory, this, process, is, called, target, motion, analysis, tma, and, the, resultant, solution, is, the, target, s, range, course, and, speed, tma, is, done, by, marking, from, which, direction, the, sound, comes, at, different, times, and, comparing, the, motion, with, that, of, the, operator, s, own, ship, changes, in, relative, motion, are, analyzed, using, standard, geometrical, techniques, along, with, some, assumptions, about, limiting, cases, passive, sonar, is, stealthy, and, very, useful, however, it, requires, high, tech, electronic, components, and, is, costly, it, is, generally, deployed, on, expensive, ships, in, the, form, of, arrays, to, enhance, detection, surface, ships, use, it, to, good, effect, it, is, even, better, used, by, submarines, and, it, is, also, used, by, airplanes, and, helicopters, mostly, to, a, surprise, effect, since, submarines, can, hide, under, thermal, layers, if, a, submarine, s, commander, believes, he, is, alone, he, may, bring, his, boat, closer, to, the, surface, and, be, easier, to, detect, or, go, deeper, and, faster, and, thus, make, more, sound, examples, of, sonar, applications, in, military, use, are, given, below, many, of, the, civil, uses, given, in, the, following, section, may, also, be, applicable, to, naval, use, until, recently, ship, sonars, were, usually, made, with, hull, mounted, arrays, either, amidships, or, at, the, bow, it, was, soon, found, after, their, initial, use, that, a, means, of, reducing, flow, noise, was, required, the, first, were, made, of, canvas, on, a, framework, then, steel, ones, were, used, now, domes, are, usually, made, of, reinforced, plastic, or, pressurized, rubber, such, sonars, are, primarily, active, in, operation, an, example, of, a, conventional, hull, mounted, sonar, is, the, sqs, 56, because, of, the, problems, of, ship, noise, towed, sonars, are, also, used, these, have, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, be, placed, deeper, in, the, water, but, have, limitations, on, their, use, in, shallow, water, these, are, called, towed, arrays, linear, or, variable, depth, sonars, vds, with, 2, 3d, arrays, a, problem, is, that, the, winches, required, to, deploy, recover, them, are, large, and, expensive, vds, sets, are, primarily, active, in, operation, while, towed, arrays, are, passive, an, example, of, a, modern, active, passive, ship, towed, sonar, is, sonar, 2087, made, by, thales, underwater, systems, modern, torpedoes, are, generally, fitted, with, an, active, passive, sonar, this, may, be, used, to, home, directly, on, the, target, but, wake, homing, torpedoes, are, also, used, an, early, example, of, an, acoustic, homer, was, the, mark, 37, torpedo, torpedo, countermeasures, can, be, towed, or, free, an, early, example, was, the, german, sieglinde, device, while, the, bold, was, a, chemical, device, a, widely, used, us, device, was, the, towed, an, slq, 25, nixie, while, the, mobile, submarine, simulator, moss, was, a, free, device, a, modern, alternative, to, the, nixie, system, is, the, uk, royal, navy, s2170, surface, ship, torpedo, defence, system, mines, may, be, fitted, with, a, sonar, to, detect, localize, and, recognize, the, required, target, an, example, is, the, captor, mine, mine, countermeasure, mcm, sonar, sometimes, called, mine, and, obstacle, avoidance, sonar, moas, is, a, specialized, type, of, sonar, used, for, detecting, small, objects, most, mcm, sonars, are, hull, mounted, but, a, few, types, are, vds, design, an, example, of, a, hull, mounted, mcm, sonar, is, the, type, 2193, while, the, sqq, 32, mine, hunting, sonar, and, type, 2093, systems, are, vds, designs, submarines, rely, on, sonar, to, a, greater, extent, than, surface, ships, as, they, cannot, use, radar, in, water, the, sonar, arrays, may, be, hull, mounted, or, towed, information, fitted, on, typical, fits, is, given, in, oyashio, class, submarine, and, swiftsure, class, submarine, helicopters, can, be, used, for, antisubmarine, warfare, by, deploying, fields, of, active, passive, sonobuoys, or, can, operate, dipping, sonar, such, as, the, aqs, 13, fixed, wing, aircraft, can, also, deploy, sonobuoys, and, have, greater, endurance, and, capacity, to, deploy, them, processing, from, the, sonobuoys, or, dipping, sonar, can, be, on, the, aircraft, or, on, ship, dipping, sonar, has, the, advantage, of, being, deployable, to, depths, appropriate, to, daily, conditions, helicopters, have, also, been, used, for, mine, countermeasure, missions, using, towed, sonars, such, as, the, aqs, 20a, dedicated, sonars, can, be, fitted, to, ships, and, submarines, for, underwater, communication, the, united, states, began, a, system, of, passive, fixed, ocean, surveillance, systems, in, 1950, with, the, classified, name, sound, surveillance, system, sosus, with, american, telephone, and, telegraph, company, at, t, with, its, bell, laboratories, research, and, western, electric, manufacturing, entities, being, contracted, for, development, and, installation, the, systems, exploited, the, sofar, channel, also, known, as, the, deep, sound, channel, where, a, sound, speed, minimum, creates, a, waveguide, in, which, low, frequency, sound, travels, thousands, of, miles, analysis, was, based, on, an, at, t, sound, spectrograph, which, converted, sound, into, a, visual, spectrogram, representing, a, time, frequency, analysis, of, sound, that, was, developed, for, speech, analysis, and, modified, to, analyze, low, frequency, underwater, sounds, that, process, was, low, frequency, analysis, and, recording, and, the, equipment, was, termed, the, low, frequency, analyzer, and, recorder, both, with, the, acronym, lofar, lofar, research, was, termed, jezebel, and, led, to, usage, in, air, and, surface, systems, particularly, sonobuoys, using, the, process, and, sometimes, using, jezebel, in, their, name, the, proposed, system, offered, such, promise, of, long, range, submarine, detection, that, the, navy, ordered, immediate, moves, for, implementation, between, installation, of, a, test, array, followed, by, a, full, scale, forty, element, prototype, operational, array, in, 1951, and, 1958, systems, were, installed, in, the, atlantic, and, then, the, pacific, under, the, unclassified, name, project, caesar, the, original, systems, were, terminated, at, classified, shore, stations, designated, naval, facility, navfac, explained, as, engaging, in, ocean, research, to, cover, their, classified, mission, the, system, was, upgraded, multiple, times, with, more, advanced, cable, allowing, the, arrays, to, be, installed, in, ocean, basins, and, upgraded, processing, the, shore, stations, were, eliminated, in, a, process, of, consolidation, and, rerouting, the, arrays, to, central, processing, centers, into, the, 1990s, in, 1985, with, new, mobile, arrays, and, other, systems, becoming, operational, the, collective, system, name, was, changed, to, integrated, undersea, surveillance, system, iuss, in, 1991, the, mission, of, the, system, was, declassified, the, year, before, iuss, insignia, were, authorized, for, wear, access, was, granted, to, some, systems, for, scientific, research, a, similar, system, is, believed, to, have, been, operated, by, the, soviet, union, sonar, can, be, used, to, detect, frogmen, and, other, scuba, divers, this, can, be, applicable, around, ships, or, at, entrances, to, ports, active, sonar, can, also, be, used, as, a, deterrent, and, or, disablement, mechanism, one, such, device, is, the, cerberus, system, limpet, mine, imaging, sonar, limis, is, a, hand, held, or, rov, mounted, imaging, sonar, designed, for, patrol, divers, combat, frogmen, or, clearance, divers, to, look, for, limpet, mines, in, low, visibility, water, the, luis, is, another, imaging, sonar, for, use, by, a, diver, integrated, navigation, sonar, system, inss, is, a, small, flashlight, shaped, handheld, sonar, for, divers, that, displays, range, this, is, a, sonar, designed, to, detect, and, locate, the, transmissions, from, hostile, active, sonars, an, example, of, this, is, the, type, 2082, fitted, on, the, british, vanguard, class, submarines, fishing, is, an, important, industry, that, is, seeing, growing, demand, but, world, catch, tonnage, is, falling, as, a, result, of, serious, resource, problems, the, industry, faces, a, future, of, continuing, worldwide, consolidation, until, a, point, of, sustainability, can, be, reached, however, the, consolidation, of, the, fishing, fleets, are, driving, increased, demands, for, sophisticated, fish, finding, electronics, such, as, sensors, sounders, and, sonars, historically, fishermen, have, used, many, different, techniques, to, find, and, harvest, fish, however, acoustic, technology, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, driving, forces, behind, the, development, of, the, modern, commercial, fisheries, sound, waves, travel, differently, through, fish, than, through, water, because, a, fish, s, air, filled, swim, bladder, has, a, different, density, than, seawater, this, density, difference, allows, the, detection, of, schools, of, fish, by, using, reflected, sound, acoustic, technology, is, especially, well, suited, for, underwater, applications, since, sound, travels, farther, and, faster, underwater, than, in, air, today, commercial, fishing, vessels, rely, almost, completely, on, acoustic, sonar, and, sounders, to, detect, fish, fishermen, also, use, active, sonar, and, echo, sounder, technology, to, determine, water, depth, bottom, contour, and, bottom, composition, companies, such, as, esonar, raymarine, marport, canada, wesmar, furuno, krupp, and, simrad, make, a, variety, of, sonar, and, acoustic, instruments, for, the, deep, sea, commercial, fishing, industry, for, example, net, sensors, take, various, underwater, measurements, and, transmit, the, information, back, to, a, receiver, on, board, a, vessel, each, sensor, is, equipped, with, one, or, more, acoustic, transducers, depending, on, its, specific, function, data, is, transmitted, from, the, sensors, using, wireless, acoustic, telemetry, and, is, received, by, a, hull, mounted, hydrophone, the, analog, signals, are, decoded, and, converted, by, a, digital, acoustic, receiver, into, data, which, is, transmitted, to, a, bridge, computer, for, graphical, display, on, a, high, resolution, monitor, echo, sounding, is, a, process, used, to, determine, the, depth, of, water, beneath, ships, and, boats, a, type, of, active, sonar, echo, sounding, is, the, transmission, of, an, acoustic, pulse, directly, downwards, to, the, seabed, measuring, the, time, between, transmission, and, echo, return, after, having, hit, the, bottom, and, bouncing, back, to, its, ship, of, origin, the, acoustic, pulse, is, emitted, by, a, transducer, which, receives, the, return, echo, as, well, the, depth, measurement, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, speed, of, sound, in, water, averaging, 1, 500, meters, per, second, by, the, time, between, emission, and, echo, return, the, value, of, underwater, acoustics, to, the, fishing, industry, has, led, to, the, development, of, other, acoustic, instruments, that, operate, in, a, similar, fashion, to, echo, sounders, but, because, their, function, is, slightly, different, from, the, initial, model, of, the, echo, sounder, have, been, given, different, terms, the, net, sounder, is, an, echo, sounder, with, a, transducer, mounted, on, the, headline, of, the, net, rather, than, on, the, bottom, of, the, vessel, nevertheless, to, accommodate, the, distance, from, the, transducer, to, the, display, unit, which, is, much, greater, than, in, a, normal, echo, sounder, several, refinements, have, to, be, made, two, main, types, are, available, the, first, is, the, cable, type, in, which, the, signals, are, sent, along, a, cable, in, this, case, there, has, to, be, the, provision, of, a, cable, drum, on, which, to, haul, shoot, and, stow, the, cable, during, the, different, phases, of, the, operation, the, second, type, is, the, cable, less, net, sounder, such, as, marport, s, trawl, explorer, in, which, the, signals, are, sent, acoustically, between, the, net, and, hull, mounted, receiver, hydrophone, on, the, vessel, in, this, case, no, cable, drum, is, required, but, sophisticated, electronics, are, needed, at, the, transducer, and, receiver, the, display, on, a, net, sounder, shows, the, distance, of, the, net, from, the, bottom, or, the, surface, rather, than, the, depth, of, water, as, with, the, echo, sounder, s, hull, mounted, transducer, fixed, to, the, headline, of, the, net, the, footrope, can, usually, be, seen, which, gives, an, indication, of, the, net, performance, any, fish, passing, into, the, net, can, also, be, seen, allowing, fine, adjustments, to, be, made, to, catch, the, most, fish, possible, in, other, fisheries, where, the, amount, of, fish, in, the, net, is, important, catch, sensor, transducers, are, mounted, at, various, positions, on, the, cod, end, of, the, net, as, the, cod, end, fills, up, these, catch, sensor, transducers, are, triggered, one, by, one, and, this, information, is, transmitted, acoustically, to, display, monitors, on, the, bridge, of, the, vessel, the, skipper, can, then, decide, when, to, haul, the, net, modern, versions, of, the, net, sounder, using, multiple, element, transducers, function, more, like, a, sonar, than, an, echo, sounder, and, show, slices, of, the, area, in, front, of, the, net, and, not, merely, the, vertical, view, that, the, initial, net, sounders, used, the, sonar, is, an, echo, sounder, with, a, directional, capability, that, can, show, fish, or, other, objects, around, the, vessel, small, sonars, have, been, fitted, to, remotely, operated, vehicles, rovs, and, unmanned, underwater, vehicles, uuvs, to, allow, their, operation, in, murky, conditions, these, sonars, are, used, for, looking, ahead, of, the, vehicle, the, long, term, mine, reconnaissance, system, is, a, uuv, for, mcm, purposes, sonars, which, act, as, beacons, are, fitted, to, aircraft, to, allow, their, location, in, the, event, of, a, crash, in, the, sea, short, and, long, baseline, sonars, may, be, used, for, caring, out, the, location, such, as, lbl, in, 2013, an, inventor, in, the, united, states, unveiled, a, spider, sense, bodysuit, equipped, with, ultrasonic, sensors, and, haptic, feedback, systems, which, alerts, the, wearer, of, incoming, threats, allowing, them, to, respond, to, attackers, even, when, blindfolded, detection, of, fish, and, other, marine, and, aquatic, life, and, estimation, their, individual, sizes, or, total, biomass, using, active, sonar, techniques, sound, pulses, reflect, off, any, object, that, has, a, different, density, than, the, surrounding, medium, this, includes, fish, or, more, specifically, the, air, filled, swim, bladder, on, fish, these, echoes, provide, information, on, fish, size, location, abundance, and, behavior, this, is, especially, effective, for, fish, swim, bladders, e, g, herring, cod, and, pollock, and, less, useful, for, fish, without, them, e, g, sharks, mackerel, and, flounder, data, from, the, watercolumn, is, usually, processed, differently, than, seafloor, or, object, detection, data, this, data, type, can, be, processed, with, specialized, software, an, upward, looking, echo, sounder, mounted, on, the, bottom, or, on, a, platform, may, be, used, to, make, measurements, of, wave, height, and, period, from, this, statistics, of, the, surface, conditions, at, a, location, can, be, derived, special, short, range, sonars, have, been, developed, to, allow, measurements, of, water, velocity, sonars, have, been, developed, that, can, be, used, to, characterise, the, sea, bottom, into, for, example, mud, sand, and, gravel, relatively, simple, sonars, such, as, echo, sounders, can, be, promoted, to, seafloor, classification, systems, via, add, on, modules, converting, echo, parameters, into, sediment, type, different, algorithms, exist, but, they, are, all, based, on, changes, in, the, energy, or, shape, of, the, reflected, sounder, pings, advanced, substrate, classification, analysis, can, be, achieved, using, calibrated, scientific, echosounders, and, parametric, or, fuzzy, logic, analysis, of, the, acoustic, data, side, scan, sonars, can, be, used, to, derive, maps, of, seafloor, topography, bathymetry, by, moving, the, sonar, across, it, just, above, the, bottom, low, frequency, sonars, such, as, gloria, have, been, used, for, continental, shelf, wide, surveys, while, high, frequency, sonars, are, used, for, more, detailed, surveys, of, smaller, areas, hull, mounted, multibeam, echosounders, on, large, surface, vessels, produce, swathes, of, bathymetric, data, in, near, real, time, one, example, the, general, instrument, seabeam, system, uses, a, projector, array, along, the, keel, to, ensonify, the, bottom, with, a, fan, beam, signals, from, a, hydrophone, array, mounted, athwartships, are, processed, to, synthesize, multiple, virtual, fan, beams, crossing, the, projector, beam, at, right, angles, creating, two, and, three, dimensional, images, using, sonar, data, powerful, low, frequency, echo, sounders, have, been, developed, for, providing, profiles, of, the, upper, layers, of, the, ocean, bottom, one, of, the, most, recent, devices, is, innomar, s, ses, 2000, quattro, multi, transducer, parametric, sbp, used, for, example, in, the, puck, bay, for, underwater, archaeological, purposes, gas, bubbles, can, leak, from, the, seabed, or, close, to, it, from, multiple, sources, these, can, be, detected, by, both, passive, and, active, sonar, shown, in, schematic, figure, by, yellow, and, red, systems, respectively, natural, seeps, of, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, occur, gas, pipelines, can, leak, and, it, is, important, to, be, able, to, detect, whether, leakage, occurs, from, carbon, capture, and, storage, facilities, ccsfs, e, g, depleted, oil, wells, into, which, extracted, atmospheric, carbon, is, stored, quantification, of, the, amount, of, gas, leaking, is, difficult, and, although, estimates, can, be, made, use, active, and, passive, sonar, it, is, important, to, question, their, accuracy, because, of, the, assumptions, inherent, in, making, such, estimations, from, sonar, data, various, synthetic, aperture, sonars, have, been, built, in, the, laboratory, and, some, have, entered, use, in, mine, hunting, and, search, systems, an, explanation, of, their, operation, is, given, in, synthetic, aperture, sonar, parametric, sources, use, the, non, linearity, of, water, to, generate, the, difference, frequency, between, two, high, frequencies, a, virtual, end, fire, array, is, formed, such, a, projector, has, advantages, of, broad, bandwidth, narrow, beamwidth, and, when, fully, developed, and, carefully, measured, it, has, no, obvious, sidelobes, see, parametric, array, its, major, disadvantage, is, very, low, efficiency, of, only, a, few, percent, p, j, westervelt, summarizes, the, trends, involved, the, use, of, both, active, and, passive, sonar, has, been, proposed, for, various, extraterrestrial, environments, one, example, is, titan, where, active, sonar, could, be, used, to, determine, the, depth, of, its, hydrocarbon, seas, and, passive, sonar, could, be, used, to, detect, methanefalls, proposals, that, do, not, take, proper, account, of, the, difference, between, terrestrial, and, extraterrestrial, environments, could, lead, to, erroneous, measurements, research, has, shown, that, use, of, active, sonar, can, lead, to, mass, strandings, of, marine, mammals, beaked, whales, the, most, common, casualty, of, the, strandings, have, been, shown, to, be, highly, sensitive, to, mid, frequency, active, sonar, other, marine, mammals, such, as, the, blue, whale, also, flee, from, the, source, of, the, sonar, while, naval, activity, was, suggested, to, be, the, most, probable, cause, of, a, mass, stranding, of, dolphins, the, us, navy, which, part, funded, some, of, the, studies, said, that, the, findings, only, showed, behavioural, responses, to, sonar, not, actual, harm, but, they, will, evaluate, the, effectiveness, of, marine, mammal, protective, measures, in, light, of, new, research, findings, a, 2008, us, supreme, court, ruling, on, the, use, of, sonar, by, the, us, navy, noted, that, there, had, been, no, cases, where, sonar, had, been, conclusively, shown, to, have, harmed, or, killed, a, marine, mammal, some, marine, animals, such, as, whales, and, dolphins, use, echolocation, systems, sometimes, called, biosonar, to, locate, predators, and, prey, research, on, the, effects, of, sonar, on, blue, whales, in, the, southern, california, bight, shows, that, mid, frequency, sonar, use, disrupts, the, whales, feeding, behavior, this, indicates, that, sonar, induced, disruption, of, feeding, and, displacement, from, high, quality, prey, patches, could, have, significant, and, previously, undocumented, impacts, on, baleen, whale, foraging, ecology, individual, fitness, and, population, health, a, review, of, evidence, on, the, mass, strandings, of, beaked, whale, linked, to, naval, exercises, where, sonar, was, used, was, published, in, 2019, it, concluded, that, the, effects, of, mid, frequency, active, sonar, are, strongest, on, cuvier, s, beaked, whales, but, vary, among, individuals, or, populations, the, review, suggested, the, strength, of, response, of, individual, animals, may, depend, on, whether, they, had, prior, exposure, to, sonar, and, that, symptoms, of, decompression, sickness, have, been, found, in, stranded, whales, that, may, be, a, result, of, such, response, to, sonar, it, noted, that, in, the, canary, islands, where, multiple, strandings, had, been, previously, reported, no, more, mass, strandings, had, occurred, once, naval, exercises, during, which, sonar, was, used, were, banned, in, the, area, and, recommended, that, the, ban, be, extended, to, other, areas, where, mass, strandings, continue, to, occur, low, frequency, sonar, can, create, a, small, temporary, shift, in, the, hearing, threshold, of, some, fish, the, frequencies, of, sonars, range, from, infrasonic, to, above, a, megahertz, generally, the, lower, frequencies, have, longer, range, while, the, higher, frequencies, offer, better, resolution, and, smaller, size, for, a, given, directionality, to, achieve, reasonable, directionality, frequencies, below, 1, khz, generally, require, large, size, usually, achieved, as, towed, arrays, low, frequency, sonars, are, loosely, defined, as, 1, 5, khz, albeit, some, navies, regard, 5, 7, khz, also, as, low, frequency, medium, frequency, is, defined, as, 5, 15, khz, another, style, of, division, considers, low, frequency, to, be, under, 1, khz, and, medium, frequency, at, between, 1, 10, khz, american, world, war, ii, era, sonars, operated, at, a, relatively, high, frequency, of, 20, 30, khz, to, achieve, directionality, with, reasonably, small, transducers, with, typical, maximum, operational, range, of, 2500, yd, postwar, sonars, used, lower, frequencies, to, achieve, longer, range, e, g, sqs, 4, operated, at, 10, khz, with, range, up, to, 5000, yd, sqs, 26, and, sqs, 53, operated, at, 3, khz, with, range, up, to, 20, 000, yd, their, domes, had, size, of, approx, a, 60, ft, personnel, boat, an, upper, size, limit, for, conventional, hull, sonars, achieving, larger, sizes, by, conformal, sonar, array, spread, over, the, hull, has, not, been, effective, so, far, for, lower, frequencies, linear, or, towed, arrays, are, therefore, used, japanese, ww2, sonars, operated, at, a, range, of, frequencies, the, type, 91, with, 30, inch, quartz, projector, worked, at, 9, khz, the, type, 93, with, smaller, quartz, projectors, operated, at, 17, 5, khz, model, 5, at, 16, or, 19, khz, magnetostrictive, at, powers, between, 1, 7, and, 2, 5, kilowatts, with, range, of, up, to, 6, km, the, later, type, 3, with, german, design, magnetostrictive, transducers, operated, at, 13, 14, 5, 16, or, 20, khz, by, model, using, twin, transducers, except, model, 1, which, had, three, single, ones, at, 0, 2, to, 2, 5, kilowatts, the, simple, type, used, 14, 5, khz, magnetostrictive, transducers, at, 0, 25, kw,
