https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation
sanitation, refers, to, public, health, conditions, related, to, clean, drinking, water, and, treatment, and, disposal, of, human, excreta, and, sewage, preventing, human, contact, with, feces, is, part, of, sanitation, as, is, hand, washing, with, soap, sanitation, systems, aim, to, protect, human, health, by, providing, a, clean, environment, that, will, stop, the, transmission, of, disease, especially, through, the, fecal, oral, route, for, example, diarrhea, a, main, cause, of, malnutrition, and, stunted, growth, in, children, can, be, reduced, through, adequate, sanitation, there, are, many, other, diseases, which, are, easily, transmitted, in, communities, that, have, low, levels, of, sanitation, such, as, ascariasis, a, type, of, intestinal, worm, infection, or, helminthiasis, cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, and, trachoma, to, name, just, a, few, a, range, of, sanitation, technologies, and, approaches, exists, some, examples, are, community, led, total, sanitation, container, based, sanitation, ecological, sanitation, emergency, sanitation, environmental, sanitation, onsite, sanitation, and, sustainable, sanitation, a, sanitation, system, includes, the, capture, storage, transport, treatment, and, disposal, or, reuse, of, human, excreta, and, wastewater, reuse, activities, within, the, sanitation, system, may, focus, on, the, nutrients, water, energy, or, organic, matter, contained, in, excreta, and, wastewater, this, is, referred, to, as, the, sanitation, value, chain, or, sanitation, economy, the, people, responsible, for, cleaning, maintaining, operating, or, emptying, a, sanitation, technology, at, any, step, of, the, sanitation, chain, are, called, sanitation, workers, 2, several, sanitation, levels, are, being, used, to, compare, sanitation, service, levels, within, countries, or, across, countries, the, sanitation, ladder, defined, by, the, joint, monitoring, programme, in, 2016, starts, at, open, defecation, and, moves, upwards, using, the, terms, unimproved, limited, basic, with, the, highest, level, being, safely, managed, this, is, particularly, applicable, to, developing, countries, the, human, right, to, water, and, sanitation, was, recognized, by, the, united, nations, un, general, assembly, in, 2010, sanitation, is, a, global, development, priority, and, the, subject, of, sustainable, development, goal, 6, the, estimate, in, 2017, by, jmp, states, that, 4, 5, billion, people, currently, do, not, have, safely, managed, sanitation, lack, of, access, to, sanitation, has, an, impact, not, only, on, public, health, but, also, on, human, dignity, and, personal, safety, there, are, some, variations, on, the, use, of, the, term, sanitation, between, countries, and, organizations, the, world, health, organization, defines, the, term, sanitation, as, follows, sanitation, generally, refers, to, the, provision, of, facilities, and, services, for, the, safe, disposal, of, human, urine, and, faeces, the, word, sanitation, also, refers, to, the, maintenance, of, hygienic, conditions, through, services, such, as, garbage, collection, and, wastewater, disposal, sanitation, includes, all, four, of, these, technical, and, non, technical, systems, excreta, management, systems, wastewater, management, systems, included, here, are, wastewater, treatment, plants, solid, waste, management, systems, as, well, as, drainage, systems, for, rainwater, also, called, stormwater, drainage, however, many, in, the, wash, sector, only, include, excreta, management, in, their, definition, of, sanitation, another, example, of, what, is, included, in, sanitation, is, found, in, the, handbook, by, sphere, on, humanitarian, charter, and, minimum, standards, in, humanitarian, response, which, describes, minimum, standards, in, four, key, response, sectors, in, humanitarian, response, situations, one, of, them, is, water, supply, sanitation, and, hygiene, promotion, wash, and, it, includes, the, following, areas, hygiene, promotion, water, supply, excreta, management, vector, control, solid, waste, management, and, wash, in, disease, outbreaks, and, healthcare, settings, 91, hygiene, promotion, is, seen, by, many, as, an, integral, part, of, sanitation, the, water, supply, and, sanitation, collaborative, council, defines, sanitation, as, the, collection, transport, treatment, and, disposal, or, reuse, of, human, excreta, domestic, wastewater, and, solid, waste, and, associated, hygiene, promotion, despite, the, fact, that, sanitation, includes, wastewater, treatment, the, two, terms, are, often, used, side, by, side, as, sanitation, and, wastewater, management, another, definition, is, in, the, dfid, guidance, manual, on, water, supply, and, sanitation, programmes, from, 1998, for, the, purposes, of, this, manual, the, word, sanitation, alone, is, taken, to, mean, the, safe, management, of, human, excreta, it, therefore, includes, both, the, hardware, e, g, latrines, and, sewers, and, the, software, regulation, hygiene, promotion, needed, to, reduce, faecal, oral, disease, transmission, it, encompasses, too, the, re, use, and, ultimate, disposal, of, human, excreta, the, term, environmental, sanitation, is, used, to, cover, the, wider, concept, of, controlling, all, the, factors, in, the, physical, environment, which, may, have, deleterious, impacts, on, human, health, and, well, being, in, developing, countries, it, normally, includes, drainage, solid, waste, management, and, vector, control, in, addition, to, the, activities, covered, by, the, definition, of, sanitation, sanitation, can, include, personal, sanitation, and, public, hygiene, personal, sanitation, work, can, include, handling, menstrual, waste, cleaning, household, toilets, and, managing, household, garbage, public, sanitation, work, can, involve, garbage, collection, transfer, and, treatment, municipal, solid, waste, management, cleaning, drains, streets, schools, trains, public, spaces, community, toilets, and, public, toilets, sewers, operating, sewage, treatment, plants, etc, 4, workers, who, provide, these, services, for, other, people, are, called, sanitation, workers, the, overall, purposes, of, sanitation, are, to, provide, a, healthy, living, environment, for, everyone, to, protect, the, natural, resources, such, as, surface, water, groundwater, soil, and, to, provide, safety, security, and, dignity, for, people, when, they, defecate, or, urinate, the, human, right, to, water, and, sanitation, was, recognized, by, the, united, nations, un, general, assembly, in, 2010, it, has, been, recognized, in, international, law, through, human, rights, treaties, declarations, and, other, standards, it, is, derived, from, the, human, right, to, an, adequate, standard, of, living, effective, sanitation, systems, provide, barriers, between, excreta, and, humans, in, such, a, way, as, to, break, the, disease, transmission, cycle, for, example, in, the, case, of, fecal, borne, diseases, this, aspect, is, visualised, with, the, f, diagram, where, all, major, routes, of, fecal, oral, disease, transmission, begin, with, the, letter, f, feces, fingers, flies, fields, fluids, food, sanitation, infrastructure, has, to, be, adapted, to, several, specific, contexts, including, consumers, expectations, and, local, resources, available, sanitation, technologies, may, involve, centralized, civil, engineering, structures, like, sewer, systems, sewage, treatment, surface, runoff, treatment, and, solid, waste, landfills, these, structures, are, designed, to, treat, wastewater, and, municipal, solid, waste, sanitation, technologies, may, also, take, the, form, of, relatively, simple, onsite, sanitation, systems, this, can, in, some, cases, consist, of, a, simple, pit, latrine, or, other, type, of, non, flush, toilet, for, the, excreta, management, part, providing, sanitation, to, people, requires, attention, to, the, entire, system, not, just, focusing, on, technical, aspects, such, as, the, toilet, fecal, sludge, management, or, the, wastewater, treatment, plant, the, sanitation, chain, involves, the, experience, of, the, user, excreta, and, wastewater, collection, methods, transporting, and, treatment, of, waste, and, reuse, or, disposal, all, need, to, be, thoroughly, considered, the, benefits, to, society, of, managing, human, excreta, are, considerable, for, public, health, as, well, as, for, the, environment, as, a, rough, estimate, for, every, us, 1, spent, on, sanitation, the, return, to, society, is, us, 5, 50, 2, for, developing, countries, the, economic, costs, of, inadequate, sanitation, is, a, huge, concern, for, example, according, to, a, world, bank, study, economic, losses, due, to, inadequate, sanitation, to, the, indian, economy, are, equivalent, to, 6, 4, of, its, gdp, most, of, these, are, due, to, premature, mortality, time, lost, in, accessing, loss, of, productivity, additional, costs, for, healthcare, among, others, inadequate, sanitation, also, leads, to, loss, from, potential, tourism, revenue, this, study, also, found, that, impacts, are, disproportionately, higher, for, the, poor, women, and, children, availability, of, toilet, at, home, on, the, other, hand, positively, contributes, to, economic, well, being, of, women, as, it, leads, to, an, increase, in, literacy, and, participation, in, labor, force, the, term, sanitation, is, connected, with, various, descriptors, or, adjectives, to, signify, certain, types, of, sanitation, systems, which, may, deal, only, with, human, excreta, management, or, with, the, entire, sanitation, system, i, e, also, greywater, stormwater, and, solid, waste, management, in, alphabetical, order, in, 2017, jmp, defined, a, new, term, basic, sanitation, service, this, is, defined, as, the, use, of, improved, sanitation, facilities, that, are, not, shared, with, other, households, a, lower, level, of, service, is, now, called, limited, sanitation, service, which, refers, to, use, of, improved, sanitation, facilities, that, are, shared, between, two, or, more, households, community, based, sanitation, is, related, to, decentralized, wastewater, treatment, dewats, the, term, dry, sanitation, is, not, in, widespread, use, and, is, not, very, well, defined, it, usually, refers, to, a, system, that, uses, a, type, of, dry, toilet, and, no, sewers, to, transport, excreta, often, when, people, speak, of, dry, sanitation, they, mean, a, sanitation, system, that, uses, urine, diverting, dry, toilet, uddts, environmental, sanitation, encompasses, the, control, of, environmental, factors, that, are, connected, to, disease, transmission, subsets, of, this, category, are, solid, waste, management, water, and, wastewater, treatment, industrial, waste, treatment, and, noise, pollution, control, according, to, world, health, organization, who, environmental, sanitation, was, defined, as, the, control, of, all, those, factors, in, the, physical, environment, which, exercise, a, harmful, effect, on, human, being, physical, development, health, and, survival, one, of, the, primary, function, of, environmental, sanitation, is, to, protect, public, health, lack, of, sanitation, refers, to, the, absence, of, sanitation, in, practical, terms, it, usually, means, lack, of, toilets, or, lack, of, hygienic, toilets, that, anybody, would, want, to, use, voluntarily, the, result, of, lack, of, sanitation, is, usually, open, defecation, and, open, urination, but, this, is, of, less, concern, with, associated, serious, public, health, issues, it, is, estimated, that, 2, 4, billion, people, still, lacked, improved, sanitation, facilities, including, 660, million, people, who, lack, access, to, safe, drinking, water, as, of, 2015, onsite, sanitation, or, on, site, sanitation, is, defined, as, a, sanitation, system, in, which, excreta, and, wastewater, are, collected, and, stored, or, treated, on, the, plot, where, they, are, generated, 173, another, term, that, is, used, for, the, same, system, is, non, sewered, sanitation, systems, nsss, which, are, prevalent, in, many, countries, nsss, play, a, vital, role, in, the, safe, management, of, fecal, sludge, accounting, for, approximately, half, of, all, existing, sanitation, provisions, the, degree, of, treatment, may, be, variable, from, none, to, advanced, examples, are, pit, latrines, no, treatment, and, septic, tanks, primary, treatment, of, wastewater, on, site, sanitation, systems, are, often, connected, to, fecal, sludge, management, fsm, systems, where, the, fecal, sludge, that, is, generated, onsite, is, treated, at, an, offsite, location, wastewater, sewage, is, only, generated, when, piped, water, supply, is, available, within, the, buildings, or, close, to, them, a, related, term, is, a, decentralized, wastewater, system, which, refers, in, particular, to, the, wastewater, part, of, on, site, sanitation, similarly, an, onsite, sewage, facility, can, treat, the, wastewater, generated, locally, the, global, methane, emissions, from, nsss, in, 2020, was, estimated, to, as, 377, mt, co2e, per, year, or, 4, 7, of, global, anthropogenic, methane, emissions, which, are, comparable, to, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, wastewater, treatment, plants, this, means, that, the, ghg, emissions, from, the, nsss, as, a, non, negligible, source, safely, managed, sanitation, is, the, highest, level, of, household, sanitation, envisioned, by, the, sustainable, development, goal, number, 6, it, is, measured, under, the, sustainable, development, goal, 6, 2, indicator, 6, 2, 1, as, the, proportion, of, population, using, a, safely, managed, sanitation, services, and, b, a, hand, washing, facility, with, soap, and, water, the, current, value, in, the, 2017, baseline, estimate, by, jmp, is, that, 4, 5, billion, people, currently, do, not, have, safely, managed, sanitation, safely, managed, sanitation, is, defined, as, an, improved, sanitation, facility, which, is, not, shared, with, other, households, and, where, the, excreta, produced, is, either, treated, and, disposed, in, situ, stored, temporarily, and, then, emptied, and, transported, to, treatment, off, site, or, transported, through, a, sewer, with, wastewater, and, then, treated, off, site, in, other, words, safely, managed, sanitation, is, a, basic, sanitation, service, where, in, addition, excreta, are, safely, disposed, of, in, situ, or, transported, and, treated, offsite, wastewater, management, consists, of, collection, wastewater, treatment, be, it, municipal, or, industrial, wastewater, disposal, or, reuse, of, treated, wastewater, the, latter, is, also, referred, to, as, water, reclamation, sanitation, systems, in, urban, areas, of, developed, countries, usually, consist, of, the, collection, of, wastewater, in, gravity, driven, sewers, its, treatment, in, wastewater, treatment, plants, for, reuse, or, disposal, in, rivers, lakes, or, the, sea, in, developing, countries, most, wastewater, is, still, discharged, untreated, into, the, environment, alternatives, to, centralized, sewer, systems, include, onsite, sanitation, decentralized, wastewater, systems, dry, toilets, connected, to, fecal, sludge, management, sewers, are, either, combined, with, storm, drains, or, separated, from, them, as, sanitary, sewers, combined, sewers, are, usually, found, in, the, central, older, parts, or, urban, areas, heavy, rainfall, and, inadequate, maintenance, can, lead, to, combined, sewer, overflows, or, sanitary, sewer, overflows, i, e, more, or, less, diluted, raw, sewage, being, discharged, into, the, environment, industries, often, discharge, wastewater, into, municipal, sewers, which, can, complicate, wastewater, treatment, unless, industries, pre, treat, their, discharges, disposal, of, solid, waste, is, most, commonly, conducted, in, landfills, but, incineration, recycling, composting, and, conversion, to, biofuels, are, also, avenues, in, the, case, of, landfills, advanced, countries, typically, have, rigid, protocols, for, daily, cover, with, topsoil, where, underdeveloped, countries, customarily, rely, upon, less, stringent, protocols, the, importance, of, daily, cover, lies, in, the, reduction, of, vector, contact, and, spreading, of, pathogens, daily, cover, also, minimizes, odor, emissions, and, reduces, windblown, litter, likewise, developed, countries, typically, have, requirements, for, perimeter, sealing, of, the, landfill, with, clay, type, soils, to, minimize, migration, of, leachate, that, could, contaminate, groundwater, and, hence, jeopardize, some, drinking, water, supplies, for, incineration, options, the, release, of, air, pollutants, including, certain, toxic, components, is, an, attendant, adverse, outcome, recycling, and, biofuel, conversion, are, the, sustainable, options, that, generally, have, superior, lifecycle, costs, particularly, when, total, ecological, consequences, are, considered, composting, value, will, ultimately, be, limited, by, the, market, demand, for, compost, product, sanitation, within, the, food, industry, means, the, adequate, treatment, of, food, contact, surfaces, by, a, process, that, is, effective, in, destroying, vegetative, cells, of, microorganisms, of, public, health, significance, and, in, substantially, reducing, numbers, of, other, undesirable, microorganisms, but, without, adversely, affecting, the, food, or, its, safety, for, the, consumer, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, code, of, federal, regulations, 21cfr110, usa, sanitation, standard, operating, procedures, are, mandatory, for, food, industries, in, united, states, similarly, in, japan, food, hygiene, has, to, be, achieved, through, compliance, with, food, sanitation, law, in, the, food, and, biopharmaceutical, industries, the, term, sanitary, equipment, means, equipment, that, is, fully, cleanable, using, clean, in, place, cip, and, sterilization, in, place, sip, procedures, that, is, fully, drainable, from, cleaning, solutions, and, other, liquids, the, design, should, have, a, minimum, amount, of, deadleg, or, areas, where, the, turbulence, during, cleaning, is, insufficient, to, remove, product, deposits, in, general, to, improve, cleanability, this, equipment, is, made, from, stainless, steel, 316l, an, alloy, containing, small, amounts, of, molybdenum, the, surface, is, usually, electropolished, to, an, effective, surface, roughness, of, less, than, 0, 5, micrometre, to, reduce, the, possibility, of, bacterial, adhesion, in, many, settings, provision, of, sanitation, facilities, alone, does, not, guarantee, good, health, of, the, population, studies, have, suggested, that, the, impact, of, hygiene, practices, have, as, great, an, impact, on, sanitation, related, diseases, as, the, actual, provision, of, sanitation, facilities, hygiene, promotion, is, therefore, an, important, part, of, sanitation, and, is, usually, key, in, maintaining, good, health, hygiene, promotion, is, a, planned, approach, of, enabling, people, to, act, and, change, their, behavior, in, an, order, to, reduce, and, or, prevent, incidences, of, water, sanitation, and, hygiene, wash, related, diseases, it, usually, involves, a, participatory, approach, of, engaging, people, to, take, responsibility, of, wash, services, and, infrastructure, including, its, operation, and, maintenance, the, three, key, elements, of, promoting, hygiene, are, mutual, sharing, of, information, and, knowledge, the, mobilization, of, affected, communities, and, the, provision, of, essential, material, and, facilities, the, who, has, investigated, which, proportion, of, death, and, disease, worldwide, can, be, attributed, to, insufficient, wash, services, in, their, analysis, they, focus, on, the, following, four, health, outcomes, diarrhea, acute, respiratory, infections, undernutrition, and, soil, transmitted, helminthiases, sths, vi, these, health, outcomes, are, also, included, as, an, indicator, for, achieving, sustainable, development, goal, 3, good, health, and, wellbeing, indicator, 3, 9, 2, reports, on, the, mortality, rate, attributed, to, unsafe, water, sanitation, and, lack, of, hygiene, when, analyzing, environmental, samples, various, types, of, indicator, organisms, are, used, to, check, for, fecal, pollution, of, the, sample, commonly, used, indicators, for, bacteriological, water, analysis, include, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, abbreviated, as, e, coli, and, non, specific, fecal, coliforms, with, regards, to, samples, of, soil, sewage, sludge, biosolids, or, fecal, matter, from, dry, toilets, helminth, eggs, are, a, commonly, used, indicator, with, helminth, egg, analysis, eggs, are, extracted, from, the, sample, after, which, a, viability, test, is, done, to, distinguish, between, viable, and, non, viable, eggs, the, viable, fraction, of, the, helminth, eggs, in, the, sample, is, then, counted, in, the, year, 2016, the, sustainable, development, goals, replaced, the, millennium, development, goals, sanitation, is, a, global, development, priority, and, included, sustainable, development, goal, 6, sdg, 6, the, target, is, about, clean, water, and, sanitation, for, all, by, 2030, it, is, estimated, that, 660, million, people, still, lacked, access, to, safe, drinking, water, as, of, 2015, since, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, 2020, the, fight, for, clean, water, and, sanitation, is, more, important, than, ever, handwashing, is, one, of, the, most, common, prevention, methods, for, coronavirus, yet, two, out, of, five, people, do, not, have, access, to, a, hand, washing, station, the, united, nations, during, the, millennium, summit, in, new, york, in, 2000, and, the, 2002, world, summit, on, sustainable, development, in, johannesburg, developed, the, millennium, development, goals, mdgs, aimed, at, poverty, eradication, and, sustainable, development, the, specific, sanitation, goal, for, the, year, 2015, was, to, reduce, by, half, the, number, of, people, who, had, no, access, to, potable, water, and, sanitation, in, the, baseline, year, of, 1990, as, the, jmp, and, the, united, nations, development, programme, undp, human, development, report, in, 2006, has, shown, progress, meeting, the, mdg, sanitation, target, is, slow, with, a, large, gap, between, the, target, coverage, and, the, current, reality, in, december, 2006, the, united, nations, general, assembly, declared, 2008, the, international, year, of, sanitation, in, recognition, of, the, slow, progress, being, made, towards, the, mdgs, sanitation, target, the, year, aimed, to, develop, awareness, and, more, actions, to, meet, the, target, there, are, numerous, reasons, for, this, gap, a, major, one, is, that, sanitation, is, rarely, given, political, attention, received, by, other, topics, despite, its, key, importance, sanitation, is, not, high, on, the, international, development, agenda, and, projects, such, as, those, relating, to, water, supply, projects, are, emphasised, the, joint, monitoring, programme, for, water, supply, and, sanitation, of, who, and, unicef, jmp, has, been, publishing, reports, of, updated, estimates, every, two, years, on, the, use, of, various, types, of, drinking, water, sources, and, sanitation, facilities, at, the, national, regional, and, global, levels, the, jmp, report, for, 2015, stated, that, in, 2011, the, bill, melinda, gates, foundation, launched, the, reinvent, the, toilet, challenge, to, promote, safer, more, effective, ways, to, treat, human, waste, the, program, is, aimed, at, developing, technologies, that, might, help, bridge, the, global, sanitation, gap, for, example, the, omni, processor, or, technology, for, fecal, sludge, management, in, 2015, the, bill, melinda, gates, foundation, published, their, water, sanitation, and, hygiene, strategy, portfolio, update, and, overview, called, building, demand, for, sanitation, the, latest, innovations, in, the, field, of, public, health, sanitation, currently, in, the, testing, phase, comprise, use, of, locally, produced, alcohol, based, hand, rub, novel, latrine, improvement, and, container, based, sanitation, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, the, national, public, health, agency, of, the, united, states, has, recognized, the, stated, three, initiatives, capacity, development, is, regarded, as, an, important, mechanism, to, achieve, progress, in, the, sanitation, sector, for, example, in, india, the, sanitation, capacity, building, platform, scbp, was, designed, to, support, and, build, the, capacity, of, town, cities, to, plan, and, implement, decentralized, sanitation, solutions, with, funding, by, the, bill, melinda, gates, foundation, from, 2015, to, 2022, results, from, this, project, showed, that, capacity, development, best, happens, on, the, job, and, in, a, learning, organization, culture, in, a, government, capacity, development, initiative, it, is, critical, to, have, an, enabling, policy, and, program, funding, to, translate, capacity, development, input, into, program, and, infrastructure, outputs, capacity, development, aims, to, empower, staff, and, institutions, develop, a, learning, strategy, learning, content, and, training, modules, as, well, as, strengthened, partnerships, and, institutions, of, learning, the, capacity, development, effectiveness, ladder, framework, cdel, identifies, five, critical, steps, for, capacity, development, interventions, developing, original, learning, content, partnerships, for, learning, and, outreach, learning, strategy, visioning, change, and, designing, solutions, contribution, to, capacity, development, discourse, a, study, was, carried, out, in, 2018, to, compare, the, lifecycle, costs, of, full, sanitation, chain, systems, in, developing, cities, of, africa, and, asia, it, found, that, conventional, sewer, systems, are, in, most, cases, the, most, expensive, sanitation, options, followed, in, order, of, cost, by, sanitation, systems, comprising, septic, tanks, ventilated, improved, pit, latrines, vip, urine, diversion, dry, toilets, and, pour, flush, pit, latrines, the, main, determinants, of, urban, sanitation, financial, costs, include, type, of, technology, labour, material, and, utility, cost, density, topography, level, of, service, provided, by, the, sanitation, system, soil, condition, energy, cost, and, others, distance, to, wastewater, treatment, facility, climate, end, use, of, treatment, products, business, models, water, table, height, some, grassroots, organizations, have, trialled, community, managed, toilet, blocks, whose, construction, and, maintenance, costs, can, be, covered, by, households, one, study, of, mumbai, informal, settlements, found, that, us, 1, 58, per, adult, would, be, sufficient, for, construction, and, less, than, us, 1, household, month, would, be, sufficient, for, maintenance, major, human, settlements, could, initially, develop, only, where, fresh, surface, water, was, plentiful, such, as, near, rivers, or, natural, springs, throughout, history, people, have, devised, systems, to, get, water, into, their, communities, and, households, and, to, dispose, and, later, also, treat, wastewater, the, focus, of, sewage, treatment, at, that, time, was, on, conveying, raw, sewage, to, a, natural, body, of, water, e, g, a, river, or, ocean, where, it, would, be, diluted, and, dissipated, the, sanitation, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, asia, is, an, example, of, public, water, supply, and, sanitation, during, the, bronze, age, 3300, 1300, bce, sanitation, in, ancient, rome, was, quite, extensive, these, systems, consisted, of, stone, and, wooden, drains, to, collect, and, remove, wastewater, from, populated, areas, see, for, instance, the, cloaca, maxima, into, the, river, tiber, in, rome, the, first, sewers, of, ancient, rome, were, built, between, 800, and, 735, bce, there, is, a, vast, number, of, professions, that, are, involved, in, the, field, of, sanitation, for, example, on, the, technical, and, operations, side, sanitation, workers, waste, collectors, sanitary, engineers
