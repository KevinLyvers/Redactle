a, large, part, of, energy, electricity, water, and, materials, consumption, as, of, 2020, they, account, for, 37, of, global, energy, use, and, energy, related, co, 2, emissions, which, the, united, nations, estimate, contributed, to, 33, of, overall, worldwide, emissions, including, the, manufacturing, of, building, materials, the, global, co, 2, emissions, were, 39, if, new, technologies, in, construction, are, not, adopted, during, this, time, of, rapid, growth, emissions, could, double, by, 2050, according, to, the, united, nations, environment, program, glass, buildings, especially, all, glass, skyscrapers, contribute, significantly, to, climate, change, due, to, their, energy, inefficiency, while, these, structures, are, visually, appealing, and, allow, abundant, natural, light, they, also, trap, heat, necessitating, increased, use, of, air, conditioning, systems, which, contribute, to, higher, carbon, emissions, experts, advocate, for, design, modifications, and, potential, restrictions, on, all, glass, edifices, to, mitigate, their, detrimental, environmental, impact, buildings, account, for, a, large, amount, of, land, according, to, the, national, resources,
