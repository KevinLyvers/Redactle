an, endoscopy, is, a, procedure, used, in, medicine, to, look, inside, the, body, the, endoscopy, procedure, uses, an, endoscope, to, examine, the, interior, of, a, hollow, organ, or, cavity, of, the, body, unlike, many, other, medical, imaging, techniques, endoscopes, are, inserted, directly, into, the, organ, there, are, many, types, of, endoscopies, depending, on, the, site, in, the, body, and, type, of, procedure, an, endoscopy, may, be, performed, by, either, a, doctor, or, a, surgeon, a, patient, may, be, fully, conscious, or, anaesthetised, during, the, procedure, most, often, the, term, endoscopy, is, used, to, refer, to, an, examination, of, the, upper, part, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, known, as, an, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, for, nonmedical, use, similar, instruments, are, called, borescopes, adolf, kussmaul, was, fascinated, by, sword, swallowers, who, would, insert, a, sword, down, their, throat, without, gagging, this, drew, inspiration, to, insert, a, hollow, tube, for, observation, the, next, problem, to, solve, was, how, to, shine, light, through, the, tube, as, they, were, still, relying, on, candles, and, oil, lamps, as, light, sources, the, term, endoscope, was, first, used, on, february, 7, 1855, by, engineer, optician, charles, chevalier, in, reference, to, the, ur, throscope, of, d, sormeaux, who, himself, began, using, the, former, term, a, month, later, the, self, illuminated, endoscope, was, developed, at, glasgow, royal, infirmary, in, scotland, one, of, the, first, hospitals, to, have, mains, electricity, in, 1894, 5, by, john, macintyre, as, part, of, his, specialization, in, the, investigation, of, the, larynx, endoscopy, may, be, used, to, investigate, symptoms, in, the, digestive, system, including, nausea, vomiting, abdominal, pain, difficulty, swallowing, and, gastrointestinal, bleeding, it, is, also, used, in, diagnosis, most, commonly, by, performing, a, biopsy, to, check, for, conditions, such, as, anemia, bleeding, inflammation, and, cancers, of, the, digestive, system, the, procedure, may, also, be, used, for, treatment, such, as, cauterization, of, a, bleeding, vessel, widening, a, narrow, esophagus, clipping, off, a, polyp, or, removing, a, foreign, object, specialty, professional, organizations, that, specialize, in, digestive, problems, advise, that, many, patients, with, barrett, s, esophagus, receive, endoscopies, too, frequently, such, societies, recommend, that, patients, with, barrett, s, esophagus, and, no, cancer, symptoms, after, two, biopsies, receive, biopsies, as, indicated, and, no, more, often, than, the, recommended, rate, health, care, providers, can, use, endoscopy, to, review, any, of, the, following, body, parts, endoscopy, is, used, for, many, procedures, an, endoscopy, is, a, simple, procedure, that, allows, a, doctor, to, look, inside, human, bodies, using, an, instrument, called, an, endoscope, a, cutting, tool, can, be, attached, to, the, end, of, the, endoscope, and, the, apparatus, can, then, be, used, to, perform, minor, procedures, such, as, tissue, biopsies, banding, of, oesophageal, varices, or, removal, of, polyps, the, main, risks, are, infection, over, sedation, perforation, or, a, tear, of, the, stomach, or, esophagus, lining, and, bleeding, although, perforation, generally, requires, surgery, certain, cases, may, be, treated, with, antibiotics, and, intravenous, fluids, bleeding, may, occur, at, the, site, of, a, biopsy, or, polyp, removal, such, typically, minor, bleeding, may, simply, stop, on, its, own, or, be, controlled, by, cauterisation, seldom, does, surgery, become, necessary, perforation, and, bleeding, are, rare, during, gastroscopy, other, minor, risks, include, drug, reactions, and, complications, related, to, other, diseases, the, patient, may, have, consequently, patients, should, inform, their, doctor, of, all, allergic, tendencies, and, medical, problems, occasionally, the, site, of, the, sedative, injection, may, become, inflamed, and, tender, for, a, short, time, this, is, usually, not, serious, and, warm, compresses, for, a, few, days, are, usually, helpful, while, any, of, these, complications, may, possibly, occur, each, of, them, occurs, quite, infrequently, a, doctor, can, further, discuss, risks, with, the, patient, with, regard, to, the, particular, need, for, gastroscopy, after, the, procedure, the, patient, will, be, observed, and, monitored, by, a, qualified, individual, in, the, endoscopy, room, or, a, recovery, area, until, a, significant, portion, of, the, medication, has, worn, off, occasionally, the, patient, is, left, with, a, mild, sore, throat, which, may, respond, to, saline, gargles, or, chamomile, tea, it, may, last, for, weeks, or, not, happen, at, all, the, patient, may, have, a, feeling, of, distention, from, the, insufflated, air, that, was, used, during, the, procedure, both, problems, are, mild, and, fleeting, when, fully, recovered, the, patient, will, be, instructed, when, to, resume, their, usual, diet, probably, within, a, few, hours, and, will, be, allowed, to, be, taken, home, where, sedation, has, been, used, most, facilities, mandate, that, the, patient, be, taken, home, by, another, person, and, that, they, not, drive, or, handle, machinery, for, the, remainder, of, the, day, patients, who, have, had, an, endoscopy, without, sedation, are, able, to, leave, unassisted
