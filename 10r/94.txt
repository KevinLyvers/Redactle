read, only, memory, rom, is, a, type, of, non, volatile, memory, used, in, computers, and, other, electronic, devices, data, stored, in, rom, cannot, be, electronically, modified, after, the, manufacture, of, the, memory, device, read, only, memory, is, useful, for, storing, software, that, is, rarely, changed, during, the, life, of, the, system, also, known, as, firmware, software, applications, such, as, video, games, for, programmable, devices, can, be, distributed, as, plug, in, cartridges, containing, rom, strictly, speaking, read, only, memory, refers, to, hard, wired, memory, such, as, diode, matrix, or, a, mask, rom, integrated, circuit, ic, that, cannot, be, electronically, changed, after, manufacture, although, discrete, circuits, can, be, altered, in, principle, through, the, addition, of, bodge, wires, and, the, removal, or, replacement, of, components, ics, cannot, correction, of, errors, or, updates, to, the, software, require, new, devices, to, be, manufactured, and, to, replace, the, installed, device, floating, gate, rom, semiconductor, memory, in, the, form, of, erasable, programmable, read, only, memory, eprom, electrically, erasable, programmable, read, only, memory, eeprom, and, flash, memory, can, be, erased, and, re, programmed, but, usually, this, can, only, be, done, at, relatively, slow, speeds, may, require, special, equipment, to, achieve, and, is, typically, only, possible, a, certain, number, of, times, the, term, rom, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, a, rom, device, containing, specific, software, or, a, file, with, software, to, be, stored, in, a, writable, rom, device, for, example, users, modifying, or, replacing, the, android, operating, system, describe, files, containing, a, modified, or, replacement, operating, system, as, custom, roms, after, the, type, of, storage, the, file, used, to, be, written, to, and, they, may, distinguish, between, rom, where, software, and, data, is, stored, usually, flash, memory, and, ram, ibm, used, capacitor, read, only, storage, cros, and, transformer, read, only, storage, tros, to, store, microcode, for, the, smaller, system, 360, models, the, 360, 85, and, the, initial, two, system, 370, models, 370, 155, and, 370, 165, on, some, models, there, was, also, a, writeable, control, store, wcs, for, additional, diagnostics, and, emulation, support, the, apollo, guidance, computer, used, core, rope, memory, programmed, by, threading, wires, through, magnetic, cores, the, simplest, type, of, solid, state, rom, is, as, old, as, the, semiconductor, technology, itself, combinational, logic, gates, can, be, joined, manually, to, map, n, bit, address, input, onto, arbitrary, values, of, m, bit, data, output, a, look, up, table, with, the, invention, of, the, integrated, circuit, came, mask, rom, mask, rom, consists, of, a, grid, of, word, lines, the, address, input, and, bit, lines, the, data, output, selectively, joined, with, transistor, switches, and, can, represent, an, arbitrary, look, up, table, with, a, regular, physical, layout, and, predictable, propagation, delay, mask, rom, is, programmed, with, photomasks, in, photolithography, during, semiconductor, manufacturing, the, mask, defines, physical, features, or, structures, that, will, be, removed, or, added, in, the, rom, chips, and, the, presence, or, absence, of, these, features, will, represent, either, a, 1, or, a, 0, bit, depending, on, the, rom, design, thus, by, design, any, attempts, to, electronically, change, the, data, will, fail, since, the, data, is, defined, by, the, presence, or, absence, of, physical, features, or, structures, that, cannot, be, electronically, changed, for, every, software, program, even, for, revisions, of, the, same, program, the, entire, mask, must, be, changed, which, can, be, costly, in, mask, rom, the, data, is, physically, encoded, in, the, circuit, so, it, can, only, be, programmed, during, fabrication, this, leads, to, a, number, of, serious, disadvantages, subsequent, developments, have, addressed, these, shortcomings, programmable, read, only, memory, prom, invented, by, wen, tsing, chow, in, 1956, allowed, users, to, program, its, contents, exactly, once, by, physically, altering, its, structure, with, the, application, of, high, voltage, pulses, this, addressed, problems, 1, and, 2, above, since, a, company, can, simply, order, a, large, batch, of, fresh, prom, chips, and, program, them, with, the, desired, contents, at, its, designers, convenience, the, advent, of, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, invented, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, enabled, the, practical, use, of, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, transistors, as, memory, cell, storage, elements, in, semiconductor, memory, a, function, previously, served, by, magnetic, cores, in, computer, memory, in, 1967, dawon, kahng, and, simon, sze, of, bell, labs, proposed, that, the, floating, gate, of, a, mos, semiconductor, device, could, be, used, for, the, cell, of, a, reprogrammable, rom, which, led, to, dov, frohman, of, intel, inventing, erasable, programmable, read, only, memory, eprom, in, 1971, the, 1971, invention, of, eprom, essentially, solved, problem, 3, since, eprom, unlike, prom, can, be, repeatedly, reset, to, its, unprogrammed, state, by, exposure, to, strong, ultraviolet, light, electrically, erasable, programmable, read, only, memory, eeprom, developed, by, yasuo, tarui, yutaka, hayashi, and, kiyoko, naga, at, the, electrotechnical, laboratory, in, 1972, went, a, long, way, to, solving, problem, 4, since, an, eeprom, can, be, programmed, in, place, if, the, containing, device, provides, a, means, to, receive, the, program, contents, from, an, external, source, for, example, a, personal, computer, via, a, serial, cable, flash, memory, invented, by, fujio, masuoka, at, toshiba, in, the, early, 1980s, and, commercialized, in, the, late, 1980s, is, a, form, of, eeprom, that, makes, very, efficient, use, of, chip, area, and, can, be, erased, and, reprogrammed, thousands, of, times, without, damage, it, permits, erasure, and, programming, of, only, a, specific, part, of, the, device, instead, of, the, entire, device, this, can, be, done, at, high, speed, hence, the, name, flash, all, of, these, technologies, improved, the, flexibility, of, rom, but, at, a, significant, cost, per, chip, so, that, in, large, quantities, mask, rom, would, remain, an, economical, choice, for, many, years, decreasing, cost, of, reprogrammable, devices, had, almost, eliminated, the, market, for, mask, rom, by, the, year, 2000, rewriteable, technologies, were, envisioned, as, replacements, for, mask, rom, the, most, recent, development, is, nand, flash, also, invented, at, toshiba, its, designers, explicitly, broke, from, past, practice, stating, plainly, that, the, aim, of, nand, flash, is, to, replace, hard, disks, rather, than, the, traditional, use, of, rom, as, a, form, of, non, volatile, primary, storage, as, of, 2021, nand, has, nearly, completely, achieved, this, goal, by, offering, throughput, higher, than, hard, disks, lower, latency, higher, tolerance, of, physical, shock, extreme, miniaturization, in, the, form, of, usb, flash, drives, and, tiny, microsd, memory, cards, for, example, and, much, lower, power, consumption, many, stored, program, computers, use, a, form, of, non, volatile, storage, that, is, storage, that, retains, its, data, when, power, is, removed, to, store, the, initial, program, that, runs, when, the, computer, is, powered, on, or, otherwise, begins, execution, a, process, known, as, bootstrapping, often, abbreviated, to, booting, or, booting, up, likewise, every, non, trivial, computer, needs, some, form, of, mutable, memory, to, record, changes, in, its, state, as, it, executes, forms, of, read, only, memory, were, employed, as, non, volatile, storage, for, programs, in, most, early, stored, program, computers, such, as, eniac, after, 1948, until, then, it, was, not, a, stored, program, computer, as, every, program, had, to, be, manually, wired, into, the, machine, which, could, take, days, to, weeks, read, only, memory, was, simpler, to, implement, since, it, needed, only, a, mechanism, to, read, stored, values, and, not, to, change, them, in, place, and, thus, could, be, implemented, with, very, crude, electromechanical, devices, see, historical, examples, below, with, the, advent, of, integrated, circuits, in, the, 1960s, both, rom, and, its, mutable, counterpart, static, ram, were, implemented, as, arrays, of, transistors, in, silicon, chips, however, a, rom, memory, cell, could, be, implemented, using, fewer, transistors, than, an, sram, memory, cell, since, the, latter, needs, a, latch, comprising, 5, 20, transistors, to, retain, its, contents, while, a, rom, cell, might, consist, of, the, absence, logical, 0, or, presence, logical, 1, of, one, transistor, connecting, a, bit, line, to, a, word, line, consequently, rom, could, be, implemented, at, a, lower, cost, per, bit, than, ram, for, many, years, most, home, computers, of, the, 1980s, stored, a, basic, interpreter, or, operating, system, in, rom, as, other, forms, of, non, volatile, storage, such, as, magnetic, disk, drives, were, too, costly, for, example, the, commodore, 64, included, 64, kb, of, ram, and, 20, kb, of, rom, containing, a, basic, interpreter, and, the, kernal, operating, system, later, home, or, office, computers, such, as, the, ibm, pc, xt, often, included, magnetic, disk, drives, and, larger, amounts, of, ram, allowing, them, to, load, their, operating, systems, from, disk, into, ram, with, only, a, minimal, hardware, initialization, core, and, bootloader, remaining, in, rom, known, as, the, bios, in, ibm, compatible, computers, this, arrangement, allowed, for, a, more, complex, and, easily, upgradeable, operating, system, in, modern, pcs, rom, is, used, to, store, the, basic, bootstrapping, firmware, for, the, processor, as, well, as, the, various, firmware, needed, to, internally, control, self, contained, devices, such, as, graphic, cards, hard, disk, drives, solid, state, drives, optical, disc, drives, tft, screens, etc, in, the, system, today, many, of, these, read, only, memories, especially, the, bios, uefi, are, often, replaced, with, eeprom, or, flash, memory, see, below, to, permit, in, place, reprogramming, should, the, need, for, a, firmware, upgrade, arise, however, simple, and, mature, sub, systems, such, as, the, keyboard, or, some, communication, controllers, in, the, integrated, circuits, on, the, main, board, for, example, may, employ, mask, rom, or, otp, one, time, programmable, rom, and, successor, technologies, such, as, flash, are, prevalent, in, embedded, systems, these, are, in, everything, from, industrial, robots, to, home, appliances, and, consumer, electronics, mp3, players, set, top, boxes, etc, all, of, which, are, designed, for, specific, functions, but, are, based, on, general, purpose, microprocessors, with, software, usually, tightly, coupled, to, hardware, program, changes, are, rarely, needed, in, such, devices, which, typically, lack, hard, disks, for, reasons, of, cost, size, or, power, consumption, as, of, 2008, most, products, use, flash, rather, than, mask, rom, and, many, provide, some, means, for, connecting, to, a, pc, for, firmware, updates, for, example, a, digital, audio, player, might, be, updated, to, support, a, new, file, format, some, hobbyists, have, taken, advantage, of, this, flexibility, to, reprogram, consumer, products, for, new, purposes, for, example, the, ipodlinux, and, openwrt, projects, have, enabled, users, to, run, full, featured, linux, distributions, on, their, mp3, players, and, wireless, routers, respectively, rom, is, also, useful, for, binary, storage, of, cryptographic, data, as, it, makes, them, difficult, to, replace, which, may, be, desirable, in, order, to, enhance, information, security, since, rom, at, least, in, hard, wired, mask, form, cannot, be, modified, it, is, only, suitable, for, storing, data, which, is, not, expected, to, need, modification, for, the, life, of, the, device, to, that, end, rom, has, been, used, in, many, computers, to, store, look, up, tables, for, the, evaluation, of, mathematical, and, logical, functions, for, example, a, floating, point, unit, might, tabulate, the, sine, function, in, order, to, facilitate, faster, computation, this, was, especially, effective, when, cpus, were, slow, and, rom, was, cheap, compared, to, ram, notably, the, display, adapters, of, early, personal, computers, stored, tables, of, bitmapped, font, characters, in, rom, this, usually, meant, that, the, text, display, font, could, not, be, changed, interactively, this, was, the, case, for, both, the, cga, and, mda, adapters, available, with, the, ibm, pc, xt, the, use, of, rom, to, store, such, small, amounts, of, data, has, disappeared, almost, completely, in, modern, general, purpose, computers, however, nand, flash, has, taken, over, a, new, role, as, a, medium, for, mass, storage, or, secondary, storage, of, files, mask, rom, is, a, read, only, memory, whose, contents, are, programmed, by, the, integrated, circuit, manufacturer, rather, than, by, the, user, the, desired, memory, contents, are, furnished, by, the, customer, to, the, device, manufacturer, the, desired, data, is, converted, into, a, custom, photomask, mask, layer, for, the, final, metallization, of, interconnections, on, the, memory, chip, hence, the, name, mask, rom, can, be, made, in, several, ways, all, of, which, aim, to, change, the, electrical, response, of, a, transistor, when, it, is, addressed, on, a, grid, such, as, mask, rom, transistors, can, be, arranged, in, either, nor, or, nand, configurations, and, can, achieve, one, of, the, smallest, cell, sizes, possible, as, each, bit, is, represented, by, only, one, transistor, nand, offers, higher, storage, density, than, nor, or, configurations, are, also, possible, but, compared, to, nor, it, only, connects, transistors, to, v, cc, instead, of, v, ss, mask, roms, used, to, be, the, most, inexpensive, and, are, the, simplest, semiconductor, memory, devices, with, only, one, metal, layer, and, one, polysilicon, layer, making, it, the, type, of, semiconductor, memory, with, the, highest, manufacturing, yield, the, highest, number, of, working, devices, per, manufacturing, run, rom, can, be, made, using, one, of, several, semiconductor, device, fabrication, technologies, such, as, cmos, nmos, pmos, and, bipolar, transistors, it, is, common, practice, to, use, rewritable, non, volatile, memory, such, as, uv, eprom, or, eeprom, for, the, development, phase, of, a, project, and, to, switch, to, mask, rom, when, the, code, has, been, finalized, for, example, atmel, microcontrollers, come, in, both, eeprom, and, mask, rom, formats, the, main, advantage, of, mask, rom, is, its, cost, per, bit, mask, rom, was, more, compact, than, any, other, kind, of, semiconductor, memory, since, the, cost, of, an, integrated, circuit, strongly, depends, on, its, size, mask, rom, is, significantly, cheaper, than, any, other, kind, of, semiconductor, memory, however, the, one, time, masking, cost, is, high, and, there, is, a, long, turn, around, time, from, design, to, product, phase, design, errors, are, costly, if, an, error, in, the, data, or, code, is, found, the, mask, rom, is, useless, and, must, be, replaced, in, order, to, change, the, code, or, data, as, of, 2003, four, companies, produce, most, such, mask, rom, chips, samsung, electronics, nec, corporation, oki, electric, industry, and, macronix, some, integrated, circuits, contain, only, mask, rom, other, integrated, circuits, contain, mask, rom, as, well, as, a, variety, of, other, devices, in, particular, many, microprocessors, have, mask, rom, to, store, their, microcode, some, microcontrollers, have, mask, rom, to, store, the, bootloader, or, all, of, their, firmware, classic, mask, programmed, rom, chips, are, integrated, circuits, that, physically, encode, the, data, to, be, stored, and, thus, it, is, impossible, to, change, their, contents, after, fabrication, it, is, also, possible, to, write, the, contents, of, a, laser, rom, by, using, a, laser, to, alter, the, electrical, properties, of, only, some, diodes, on, the, rom, or, by, using, a, laser, to, cut, only, some, polysilicon, links, instead, of, using, a, mask, by, applying, write, protection, some, types, of, reprogrammable, roms, may, temporarily, become, read, only, memory, there, are, other, types, of, non, volatile, memory, which, are, not, based, on, solid, state, ic, technology, including, although, the, relative, speed, of, ram, vs, rom, has, varied, over, time, as, of, 2007, large, ram, chips, can, be, read, faster, than, most, roms, for, this, reason, and, to, allow, uniform, access, rom, content, is, sometimes, copied, to, ram, or, shadowed, before, its, first, use, and, subsequently, read, from, ram, for, those, types, of, rom, that, can, be, electrically, modified, writing, speed, has, traditionally, been, much, slower, than, reading, speed, and, it, may, need, unusually, high, voltage, the, movement, of, jumper, plugs, to, apply, write, enable, signals, and, special, lock, unlock, command, codes, modern, nand, flash, can, be, used, to, achieve, the, highest, write, speeds, of, any, rewritable, rom, technology, with, speeds, as, high, as, 10, gb, s, in, an, ssd, this, has, been, enabled, by, the, increased, investment, in, both, consumer, and, enterprise, solid, state, drives, and, flash, memory, products, for, higher, end, mobile, devices, on, a, technical, level, the, gains, have, been, achieved, by, increasing, parallelism, both, in, controller, design, and, of, storage, the, use, of, large, dram, read, write, caches, and, the, implementation, of, memory, cells, which, can, store, more, than, one, bit, dlc, tlc, and, mlc, the, latter, approach, is, more, failure, prone, but, this, has, been, largely, mitigated, by, overprovisioning, the, inclusion, of, spare, capacity, in, a, product, which, is, visible, only, to, the, drive, controller, and, by, increasingly, sophisticated, read, write, algorithms, in, drive, firmware, because, they, are, written, by, forcing, electrons, through, a, layer, of, electrical, insulation, onto, a, floating, transistor, gate, rewriteable, roms, can, withstand, only, a, limited, number, of, write, and, erase, cycles, before, the, insulation, is, permanently, damaged, in, the, earliest, eproms, this, might, occur, after, as, few, as, 1, 000, write, cycles, while, in, modern, flash, eeprom, the, endurance, may, exceed, 1, 000, 000, the, limited, endurance, as, well, as, the, higher, cost, per, bit, means, that, flash, based, storage, is, unlikely, to, completely, supplant, magnetic, disk, drives, in, the, near, future, the, timespan, over, which, a, rom, remains, accurately, readable, is, not, limited, by, write, cycling, the, data, retention, of, eprom, earom, eeprom, and, flash, may, be, time, limited, by, charge, leaking, from, the, floating, gates, of, the, memory, cell, transistors, early, generation, eeprom, s, in, the, mid, 1980s, generally, cited, 5, or, 6, year, data, retention, a, review, of, eeprom, s, offered, in, the, year, 2020, shows, manufacturers, citing, 100, year, data, retention, adverse, environments, will, reduce, the, retention, time, leakage, is, accelerated, by, high, temperatures, or, radiation, masked, rom, and, fuse, antifuse, prom, do, not, suffer, from, this, effect, as, their, data, retention, depends, on, physical, rather, than, electrical, permanence, of, the, integrated, circuit, although, fuse, re, growth, was, once, a, problem, in, some, systems, the, contents, of, rom, chips, can, be, extracted, with, special, hardware, devices, and, relevant, controlling, software, this, practice, is, common, for, as, a, main, example, reading, the, contents, of, older, video, game, console, cartridges, another, example, is, making, backups, of, firmware, os, roms, from, older, computers, or, other, devices, for, archival, purposes, as, in, many, cases, the, original, chips, are, proms, and, thus, at, risk, of, exceeding, their, usable, data, lifetime, the, resultant, memory, dump, files, are, known, as, rom, images, or, abbreviated, roms, and, can, be, used, to, produce, duplicate, roms, for, example, to, produce, new, cartridges, or, as, digital, files, for, playing, in, console, emulators, the, term, rom, image, originated, when, most, console, games, were, distributed, on, cartridges, containing, rom, chips, but, achieved, such, widespread, usage, that, it, is, still, applied, to, images, of, newer, games, distributed, on, cd, roms, or, other, optical, media, rom, images, of, commercial, games, firmware, etc, usually, contain, copyrighted, software, the, unauthorized, copying, and, distribution, of, copyrighted, software, is, a, violation, of, copyright, laws, in, many, jurisdictions, although, duplication, for, backup, purposes, may, be, considered, fair, use, depending, on, location, in, any, case, there, is, a, thriving, community, engaged, in, the, distribution, and, trading, of, such, software, for, preservation, sharing, purposes
