gunpowder, also, commonly, known, as, black, powder, to, distinguish, it, from, modern, smokeless, powder, is, the, earliest, known, chemical, explosive, it, consists, of, a, mixture, of, sulfur, charcoal, which, is, mostly, carbon, and, potassium, nitrate, saltpeter, the, sulfur, and, charcoal, act, as, fuels, while, the, saltpeter, is, an, oxidizer, gunpowder, has, been, widely, used, as, a, propellant, in, firearms, artillery, rocketry, and, pyrotechnics, including, use, as, a, blasting, agent, for, explosives, in, quarrying, mining, building, pipelines, tunnels, and, roads, gunpowder, is, classified, as, a, low, explosive, because, of, its, relatively, slow, decomposition, rate, and, consequently, low, brisance, breaking, shattering, low, explosives, deflagrate, i, e, burn, at, subsonic, speeds, whereas, high, explosives, detonate, producing, a, supersonic, shockwave, ignition, of, gunpowder, packed, behind, a, projectile, generates, enough, pressure, to, force, the, shot, from, the, muzzle, at, high, speed, but, usually, not, enough, force, to, rupture, the, gun, barrel, it, thus, makes, a, good, propellant, but, is, less, suitable, for, shattering, rock, or, fortifications, with, its, low, yield, explosive, power, nonetheless, it, was, widely, used, to, fill, fused, artillery, shells, and, used, in, mining, and, civil, engineering, projects, until, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, first, high, explosives, were, put, into, use, gunpowder, is, one, of, the, four, great, inventions, of, china, originally, developed, by, taoists, for, medicinal, purposes, it, was, first, used, for, warfare, around, ad, 904, its, use, in, weapons, has, declined, due, to, smokeless, powder, replacing, it, and, it, is, no, longer, used, for, industrial, purposes, due, to, its, relative, inefficiency, compared, to, newer, alternatives, such, as, dynamite, and, ammonium, nitrate, fuel, oil, gunpowder, is, a, low, explosive, it, does, not, detonate, but, rather, deflagrates, burns, quickly, this, is, an, advantage, in, a, propellant, device, where, one, does, not, desire, a, shock, that, would, shatter, the, gun, and, potentially, harm, the, operator, however, it, is, a, drawback, when, an, explosion, is, desired, in, that, case, the, propellant, and, most, importantly, gases, produced, by, its, burning, must, be, confined, since, it, contains, its, own, oxidizer, and, additionally, burns, faster, under, pressure, its, combustion, is, capable, of, bursting, containers, such, as, a, shell, grenade, or, improvised, pipe, bomb, or, pressure, cooker, casings, to, form, shrapnel, in, quarrying, high, explosives, are, generally, preferred, for, shattering, rock, however, because, of, its, low, brisance, gunpowder, causes, fewer, fractures, and, results, in, more, usable, stone, compared, to, other, explosives, making, it, useful, for, blasting, slate, which, is, fragile, or, monumental, stone, such, as, granite, and, marble, gunpowder, is, well, suited, for, blank, rounds, signal, flares, burst, charges, and, rescue, line, launches, it, is, also, used, in, fireworks, for, lifting, shells, in, rockets, as, fuel, and, in, certain, special, effects, combustion, converts, less, than, half, the, mass, of, gunpowder, to, gas, most, of, it, turns, into, particulate, matter, some, of, it, is, ejected, wasting, propelling, power, fouling, the, air, and, generally, being, a, nuisance, giving, away, a, soldier, s, position, generating, fog, that, hinders, vision, etc, some, of, it, ends, up, as, a, thick, layer, of, soot, inside, the, barrel, where, it, also, is, a, nuisance, for, subsequent, shots, and, a, cause, of, jamming, an, automatic, weapon, moreover, this, residue, is, hygroscopic, and, with, the, addition, of, moisture, absorbed, from, the, air, forms, a, corrosive, substance, the, soot, contains, potassium, oxide, or, sodium, oxide, that, turns, into, potassium, hydroxide, or, sodium, hydroxide, which, corrodes, wrought, iron, or, steel, gun, barrels, gunpowder, arms, therefore, require, thorough, and, regular, cleaning, to, remove, the, residue, gunpowder, loads, can, be, used, in, modern, firearms, as, long, as, they, are, not, gas, operated, the, most, compatible, modern, guns, are, smoothbore, barreled, shotguns, that, are, long, recoil, operated, with, chrome, plated, essential, parts, such, as, barrels, and, bores, such, guns, have, minimal, fouling, and, corrosion, and, are, easier, to, clean, the, first, confirmed, reference, to, what, can, be, considered, gunpowder, in, china, occurred, in, the, 9th, century, ad, during, the, tang, dynasty, first, in, a, formula, contained, in, the, taishang, shengzu, jindan, mijue, in, 808, and, then, about, 50, years, later, in, a, taoist, text, known, as, the, zhenyuan, miaodao, yaol, e, the, taishang, shengzu, jindan, mijue, mentions, a, formula, composed, of, six, parts, sulfur, to, six, parts, saltpeter, to, one, part, birthwort, herb, according, to, the, zhenyuan, miaodao, yaol, e, some, have, heated, together, sulfur, realgar, and, saltpeter, with, honey, smoke, and, flames, result, so, that, their, hands, and, faces, have, been, burnt, and, even, the, whole, house, where, they, were, working, burned, down, based, on, these, taoist, texts, the, invention, of, gunpowder, by, chinese, alchemists, was, likely, an, accidental, byproduct, from, experiments, seeking, to, create, the, elixir, of, life, this, experimental, medicine, origin, is, reflected, in, its, chinese, name, huoyao, chinese, pinyin, hu, y, o, xuo, y, which, means, fire, medicine, saltpeter, was, known, to, the, chinese, by, the, mid, 1st, century, ad, and, was, primarily, produced, in, the, provinces, of, sichuan, shanxi, and, shandong, there, is, strong, evidence, of, the, use, of, saltpeter, and, sulfur, in, various, medicinal, combinations, a, chinese, alchemical, text, dated, 492, noted, saltpeter, burnt, with, a, purple, flame, providing, a, practical, and, reliable, means, of, distinguishing, it, from, other, inorganic, salts, thus, enabling, alchemists, to, evaluate, and, compare, purification, techniques, the, earliest, latin, accounts, of, saltpeter, purification, are, dated, after, 1200, the, earliest, chemical, formula, for, gunpowder, appeared, in, the, 11th, century, song, dynasty, text, wujing, zongyao, complete, essentials, from, the, military, classics, written, by, zeng, gongliang, between, 1040, and, 1044, the, wujing, zongyao, provides, encyclopedia, references, to, a, variety, of, mixtures, that, included, petrochemicals, as, well, as, garlic, and, honey, a, slow, match, for, flame, throwing, mechanisms, using, the, siphon, principle, and, for, fireworks, and, rockets, is, mentioned, the, mixture, formulas, in, this, book, contain, at, most, 50, saltpeter, not, enough, to, create, an, explosion, they, produce, an, incendiary, instead, the, essentials, was, written, by, a, song, dynasty, court, bureaucrat, and, there, is, little, evidence, that, it, had, any, immediate, impact, on, warfare, there, is, no, mention, of, its, use, in, the, chronicles, of, the, wars, against, the, tanguts, in, the, 11th, century, and, china, was, otherwise, mostly, at, peace, during, this, century, however, it, had, already, been, used, for, fire, arrows, since, at, least, the, 10th, century, its, first, recorded, military, application, dates, its, use, to, 904, in, the, form, of, incendiary, projectiles, in, the, following, centuries, various, gunpowder, weapons, such, as, bombs, fire, lances, and, the, gun, appeared, in, china, explosive, weapons, such, as, bombs, have, been, discovered, in, a, shipwreck, off, the, shore, of, japan, dated, from, 1281, during, the, mongol, invasions, of, japan, by, 1083, the, song, court, was, producing, hundreds, of, thousands, of, fire, arrows, for, their, garrisons, bombs, and, the, first, proto, guns, known, as, fire, lances, became, prominent, during, the, 12th, century, and, were, used, by, the, song, during, the, jin, song, wars, fire, lances, were, first, recorded, to, have, been, used, at, the, siege, of, de, an, in, 1132, by, song, forces, against, the, jin, in, the, early, 13th, century, the, jin, used, iron, casing, bombs, projectiles, were, added, to, fire, lances, and, re, usable, fire, lance, barrels, were, developed, first, out, of, hardened, paper, and, then, metal, by, 1257, some, fire, lances, were, firing, wads, of, bullets, in, the, late, 13th, century, metal, fire, lances, became, eruptors, proto, cannons, firing, co, viative, projectiles, mixed, with, the, propellant, rather, than, seated, over, it, with, a, wad, and, by, 1287, at, the, latest, had, become, true, guns, the, hand, cannon, according, to, iqtidar, alam, khan, it, was, invading, mongols, who, introduced, gunpowder, to, the, islamic, world, the, muslims, acquired, knowledge, of, gunpowder, sometime, between, 1240, and, 1280, by, which, point, the, syrian, hasan, al, rammah, had, written, recipes, instructions, for, the, purification, of, saltpeter, and, descriptions, of, gunpowder, incendiaries, it, is, implied, by, al, rammah, s, usage, of, terms, that, suggested, he, derived, his, knowledge, from, chinese, sources, and, his, references, to, saltpeter, as, chinese, snow, arabic, thalj, al, n, fireworks, as, chinese, flowers, and, rockets, as, chinese, arrows, that, knowledge, of, gunpowder, arrived, from, china, however, because, al, rammah, attributes, his, material, to, his, father, and, forefathers, al, hassan, argues, that, gunpowder, became, prevalent, in, syria, and, egypt, by, the, end, of, the, twelfth, century, or, the, beginning, of, the, thirteenth, in, persia, saltpeter, was, known, as, chinese, salt, persian, namak, i, ch, n, or, salt, from, chinese, salt, marshes, namak, i, sh, ra, yi, ch, n, hasan, al, rammah, included, 107, gunpowder, recipes, in, his, text, al, furusiyyah, wa, al, manasib, al, harbiyya, the, book, of, military, horsemanship, and, ingenious, war, devices, 22, of, which, are, for, rockets, if, one, takes, the, median, of, 17, of, these, 22, compositions, for, rockets, 75, nitrates, 9, 06, sulfur, and, 15, 94, charcoal, it, is, nearly, identical, to, the, modern, reported, ideal, recipe, of, 75, potassium, nitrate, 10, sulfur, and, 15, charcoal, the, text, also, mentions, fuses, incendiary, bombs, naphtha, pots, fire, lances, and, an, illustration, and, description, of, the, earliest, torpedo, the, torpedo, was, called, the, egg, which, moves, itself, and, burns, two, iron, sheets, were, fastened, together, and, tightened, using, felt, the, flattened, pear, shaped, vessel, was, filled, with, gunpowder, metal, filings, good, mixtures, two, rods, and, a, large, rocket, for, propulsion, judging, by, the, illustration, it, was, evidently, supposed, to, glide, across, the, water, fire, lances, were, used, in, battles, between, the, muslims, and, mongols, in, 1299, and, 1303, al, hassan, claims, that, in, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, of, 1260, the, mamluks, used, the, first, cannon, in, history, against, the, mongols, utilizing, a, formula, with, near, identical, ideal, composition, ratios, for, explosive, gunpowder, other, historians, urge, caution, regarding, claims, of, islamic, firearms, use, in, the, 1204, 1324, period, as, late, medieval, arabic, texts, used, the, same, word, for, gunpowder, naft, that, they, used, for, an, earlier, incendiary, naphtha, the, earliest, surviving, documentary, evidence, for, cannons, in, the, islamic, world, is, from, an, arabic, manuscript, dated, to, the, early, 14th, century, the, author, s, name, is, uncertain, but, may, have, been, shams, al, din, muhammad, who, died, in, 1350, dating, from, around, 1320, 1350, the, illustrations, show, gunpowder, weapons, such, as, gunpowder, arrows, bombs, fire, tubes, and, fire, lances, or, proto, guns, the, manuscript, describes, a, type, of, gunpowder, weapon, called, a, midfa, which, uses, gunpowder, to, shoot, projectiles, out, of, a, tube, at, the, end, of, a, stock, some, consider, this, to, be, a, cannon, while, others, do, not, the, problem, with, identifying, cannons, in, early, 14th, century, arabic, texts, is, the, term, midfa, which, appears, from, 1342, to, 1352, but, cannot, be, proven, to, be, true, hand, guns, or, bombards, contemporary, accounts, of, a, metal, barrel, cannon, in, the, islamic, world, do, not, occur, until, 1365, needham, believes, that, in, its, original, form, the, term, midfa, refers, to, the, tube, or, cylinder, of, a, naphtha, projector, flamethrower, then, after, the, invention, of, gunpowder, it, meant, the, tube, of, fire, lances, and, eventually, it, applied, to, the, cylinder, of, hand, guns, and, cannons, according, to, paul, e, j, hammer, the, mamluks, certainly, used, cannons, by, 1342, according, to, j, lavin, cannons, were, used, by, moors, at, the, siege, of, algeciras, in, 1343, a, metal, cannon, firing, an, iron, ball, was, described, by, shihab, al, din, abu, al, abbas, al, qalqashandi, between, 1365, and, 1376, the, musket, appeared, in, the, ottoman, empire, by, 1465, in, 1598, chinese, writer, zhao, shizhen, described, turkish, muskets, as, being, superior, to, european, muskets, the, chinese, military, book, wu, pei, chih, 1621, later, described, turkish, muskets, that, used, a, rack, and, pinion, mechanism, which, was, not, known, to, have, been, used, in, european, or, chinese, firearms, at, the, time, the, state, controlled, manufacture, of, gunpowder, by, the, ottoman, empire, through, early, supply, chains, to, obtain, nitre, sulfur, and, high, quality, charcoal, from, oaks, in, anatolia, contributed, significantly, to, its, expansion, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, century, it, was, not, until, later, in, the, 19th, century, when, the, syndicalist, production, of, turkish, gunpowder, was, greatly, reduced, which, coincided, with, the, decline, of, its, military, might, the, earliest, western, accounts, of, gunpowder, appear, in, texts, written, by, english, philosopher, roger, bacon, in, 1267, called, opus, majus, and, opus, tertium, the, oldest, written, recipes, in, continental, europe, were, recorded, under, the, name, marcus, graecus, or, mark, the, greek, between, 1280, and, 1300, in, the, liber, ignium, or, book, of, fires, some, sources, mention, possible, gunpowder, weapons, being, deployed, by, the, mongols, against, european, forces, at, the, battle, of, mohi, in, 1241, professor, kenneth, warren, chase, credits, the, mongols, for, introducing, into, europe, gunpowder, and, its, associated, weaponry, however, there, is, no, clear, route, of, transmission, and, while, the, mongols, are, often, pointed, to, as, the, likeliest, vector, timothy, may, points, out, that, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, that, the, mongols, used, gunpowder, weapons, on, a, regular, basis, outside, of, china, may, also, states, however, the, mongols, used, the, gunpowder, weapon, in, their, wars, against, the, jin, the, song, and, in, their, invasions, of, japan, records, show, that, in, england, gunpowder, was, being, made, in, 1346, at, the, tower, of, london, a, powder, house, existed, at, the, tower, in, 1461, and, in, 1515, three, king, s, gunpowder, makers, worked, there, gunpowder, was, also, being, made, or, stored, at, other, royal, castles, such, as, portchester, the, english, civil, war, 1642, 1645, led, to, an, expansion, of, the, gunpowder, industry, with, the, repeal, of, the, royal, patent, in, august, 1641, in, late, 14th, century, europe, gunpowder, was, improved, by, corning, the, practice, of, drying, it, into, small, clumps, to, improve, combustion, and, consistency, during, this, time, european, manufacturers, also, began, regularly, purifying, saltpeter, using, wood, ashes, containing, potassium, carbonate, to, precipitate, calcium, from, their, dung, liquor, and, using, ox, blood, alum, and, slices, of, turnip, to, clarify, the, solution, during, the, renaissance, two, european, schools, of, pyrotechnic, thought, emerged, one, in, italy, and, the, other, at, nuremberg, germany, in, italy, vannoccio, biringuccio, born, in, 1480, was, a, member, of, the, guild, fraternita, di, santa, barbara, but, broke, with, the, tradition, of, secrecy, by, setting, down, everything, he, knew, in, a, book, titled, de, la, pirotechnia, written, in, vernacular, it, was, published, posthumously, in, 1540, with, 9, editions, over, 138, years, and, also, reprinted, by, mit, press, in, 1966, by, the, mid, 17th, century, fireworks, were, used, for, entertainment, on, an, unprecedented, scale, in, europe, being, popular, even, at, resorts, and, public, gardens, with, the, publication, of, deutliche, anweisung, zur, feuerwerkerey, 1748, methods, for, creating, fireworks, were, sufficiently, well, known, and, well, described, that, firework, making, has, become, an, exact, science, in, 1774, louis, xvi, ascended, to, the, throne, of, france, at, age, 20, after, he, discovered, that, france, was, not, self, sufficient, in, gunpowder, a, gunpowder, administration, was, established, to, head, it, the, lawyer, antoine, lavoisier, was, appointed, although, from, a, bourgeois, family, after, his, degree, in, law, lavoisier, became, wealthy, from, a, company, set, up, to, collect, taxes, for, the, crown, this, allowed, him, to, pursue, experimental, natural, science, as, a, hobby, without, access, to, cheap, saltpeter, controlled, by, the, british, for, hundreds, of, years, france, had, relied, on, saltpetremen, with, royal, warrants, the, droit, de, fouille, or, right, to, dig, to, seize, nitrous, containing, soil, and, demolish, walls, of, barnyards, without, compensation, to, the, owners, this, caused, farmers, the, wealthy, or, entire, villages, to, bribe, the, petermen, and, the, associated, bureaucracy, to, leave, their, buildings, alone, and, the, saltpeter, uncollected, lavoisier, instituted, a, crash, program, to, increase, saltpeter, production, revised, and, later, eliminated, the, droit, de, fouille, researched, best, refining, and, powder, manufacturing, methods, instituted, management, and, record, keeping, and, established, pricing, that, encouraged, private, investment, in, works, although, saltpeter, from, new, prussian, style, putrefaction, works, had, not, been, produced, yet, the, process, taking, about, 18, months, in, only, a, year, france, had, gunpowder, to, export, a, chief, beneficiary, of, this, surplus, was, the, american, revolution, by, careful, testing, and, adjusting, the, proportions, and, grinding, time, powder, from, mills, such, as, at, essonne, outside, paris, became, the, best, in, the, world, by, 1788, and, inexpensive, two, british, physicists, andrew, noble, and, frederick, abel, worked, to, improve, the, properties, of, gunpowder, during, the, late, 19th, century, this, formed, the, basis, for, the, noble, abel, gas, equation, for, internal, ballistics, the, introduction, of, smokeless, powder, in, the, late, 19th, century, led, to, a, contraction, of, the, gunpowder, industry, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, majority, of, the, british, gunpowder, manufacturers, merged, into, a, single, company, explosives, trades, limited, and, a, number, of, sites, were, closed, down, including, those, in, ireland, this, company, became, nobel, industries, limited, and, in, 1926, became, a, founding, member, of, imperial, chemical, industries, the, home, office, removed, gunpowder, from, its, list, of, permitted, explosives, shortly, afterwards, on, 31, december, 1931, the, former, curtis, harvey, s, glynneath, gunpowder, factory, at, pontneddfechan, in, wales, closed, down, the, factory, was, demolished, by, fire, in, 1932, the, last, remaining, gunpowder, mill, at, the, royal, gunpowder, factory, waltham, abbey, was, damaged, by, a, german, parachute, mine, in, 1941, and, it, never, reopened, this, was, followed, by, the, closure, and, demolition, of, the, gunpowder, section, at, the, royal, ordnance, factory, rof, chorley, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, of, ici, nobel, s, roslin, gunpowder, factory, which, closed, in, 1954, this, left, ici, nobel, s, ardeer, site, in, scotland, which, included, a, gunpowder, factory, as, the, only, factory, in, great, britain, producing, gunpowder, the, gunpowder, area, of, the, ardeer, site, closed, in, october, 1976, gunpowder, and, gunpowder, weapons, were, transmitted, to, india, through, the, mongol, invasions, of, india, the, mongols, were, defeated, by, alauddin, khalji, of, the, delhi, sultanate, and, some, of, the, mongol, soldiers, remained, in, northern, india, after, their, conversion, to, islam, it, was, written, in, the, tarikh, i, firishta, 1606, 1607, that, nasiruddin, mahmud, the, ruler, of, the, delhi, sultanate, presented, the, envoy, of, the, mongol, ruler, hulegu, khan, with, a, dazzling, pyrotechnics, display, upon, his, arrival, in, delhi, in, 1258, nasiruddin, mahmud, tried, to, express, his, strength, as, a, ruler, and, tried, to, ward, off, any, mongol, attempt, similar, to, the, siege, of, baghdad, 1258, firearms, known, as, top, o, tufak, also, existed, in, many, muslim, kingdoms, in, india, by, as, early, as, 1366, from, then, on, the, employment, of, gunpowder, warfare, in, india, was, prevalent, with, events, such, as, the, siege, of, belgaum, in, 1473, by, sultan, muhammad, shah, bahmani, the, shipwrecked, ottoman, admiral, seydi, ali, reis, is, known, to, have, introduced, the, earliest, type, of, matchlock, weapons, which, the, ottomans, used, against, the, portuguese, during, the, siege, of, diu, 1531, after, that, a, diverse, variety, of, firearms, large, guns, in, particular, became, visible, in, tanjore, dacca, bijapur, and, murshidabad, guns, made, of, bronze, were, recovered, from, calicut, 1504, the, former, capital, of, the, zamorins, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, mass, produced, matchlocks, for, the, mughal, army, akbar, is, personally, known, to, have, shot, a, leading, rajput, commander, during, the, siege, of, chittorgarh, the, mughals, began, to, use, bamboo, rockets, mainly, for, signalling, and, employ, sappers, special, units, that, undermined, heavy, stone, fortifications, to, plant, gunpowder, charges, the, mughal, emperor, shah, jahan, is, known, to, have, introduced, much, more, advanced, matchlocks, their, designs, were, a, combination, of, ottoman, and, mughal, designs, shah, jahan, also, countered, the, british, and, other, europeans, in, his, province, of, gujar, t, which, supplied, europe, saltpeter, for, use, in, gunpowder, warfare, during, the, 17th, century, bengal, and, m, lwa, participated, in, saltpeter, production, the, dutch, french, portuguese, and, english, used, chhapra, as, a, center, of, saltpeter, refining, ever, since, the, founding, of, the, sultanate, of, mysore, by, hyder, ali, french, military, officers, were, employed, to, train, the, mysore, army, hyder, ali, and, his, son, tipu, sultan, were, the, first, to, introduce, modern, cannons, and, muskets, their, army, was, also, the, first, in, india, to, have, official, uniforms, during, the, second, anglo, mysore, war, hyder, ali, and, his, son, tipu, sultan, unleashed, the, mysorean, rockets, at, their, british, opponents, effectively, defeating, them, on, various, occasions, the, mysorean, rockets, inspired, the, development, of, the, congreve, rocket, which, the, british, widely, used, during, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, war, of, 1812, cannons, were, introduced, to, majapahit, when, kublai, khan, s, chinese, army, under, the, leadership, of, ike, mese, sought, to, invade, java, in, 1293, history, of, yuan, mentioned, that, the, mongol, used, cannons, chinese, p, o, against, daha, forces, 1, 2, 220, cannons, were, used, by, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, in, 1352, during, its, invasion, of, the, khmer, empire, within, a, decade, large, quantities, of, gunpowder, could, be, found, in, the, khmer, empire, by, the, end, of, the, century, firearms, were, also, used, by, the, tr, n, dynasty, even, though, the, knowledge, of, making, gunpowder, based, weapons, was, known, after, the, failed, mongol, invasion, of, java, and, the, predecessor, of, firearms, the, pole, gun, bedil, tombak, is, recorded, as, being, used, by, java, in, 1413, 245, the, knowledge, of, making, true, firearms, came, much, later, after, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, it, was, brought, by, the, islamic, nations, of, west, asia, most, probably, the, arabs, the, precise, year, of, introduction, is, unknown, but, it, may, be, safely, concluded, to, be, no, earlier, than, 1460, 23, before, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, in, southeast, asia, the, natives, already, possessed, primitive, firearms, the, java, arquebus, portuguese, influence, to, local, weaponry, after, the, capture, of, malacca, 1511, resulted, in, a, new, type, of, hybrid, tradition, matchlock, firearm, the, istinggar, 53, when, the, portuguese, came, to, the, archipelago, they, referred, to, the, breech, loading, swivel, gun, as, ber, o, while, the, spaniards, call, it, verso, 151, by, the, early, 16th, century, the, javanese, already, locally, producing, large, guns, some, of, them, still, survived, until, the, present, day, and, dubbed, as, sacred, cannon, or, holy, cannon, these, cannons, varied, between, 180, and, 260, pounders, weighing, anywhere, between, 3, and, 8, tons, length, of, them, between, 3, and, 6, m, saltpeter, harvesting, was, recorded, by, dutch, and, german, travelers, as, being, common, in, even, the, smallest, villages, and, was, collected, from, the, decomposition, process, of, large, dung, hills, specifically, piled, for, the, purpose, the, dutch, punishment, for, possession, of, non, permitted, gunpowder, appears, to, have, been, amputation, 180, 181, ownership, and, manufacture, of, gunpowder, was, later, prohibited, by, the, colonial, dutch, occupiers, according, to, colonel, mckenzie, quoted, in, sir, thomas, stamford, raffles, the, history, of, java, 1817, the, purest, sulfur, was, supplied, from, a, crater, from, a, mountain, near, the, straits, of, bali, 180, 181, on, the, origins, of, gunpowder, technology, historian, tonio, andrade, remarked, scholars, today, overwhelmingly, concur, that, the, gun, was, invented, in, china, gunpowder, and, the, gun, are, widely, believed, by, historians, to, have, originated, from, china, due, to, the, large, body, of, evidence, that, documents, the, evolution, of, gunpowder, from, a, medicine, to, an, incendiary, and, explosive, and, the, evolution, of, the, gun, from, the, fire, lance, to, a, metal, gun, whereas, similar, records, do, not, exist, elsewhere, as, andrade, explains, the, large, amount, of, variation, in, gunpowder, recipes, in, china, relative, to, europe, is, evidence, of, experimentation, in, china, where, gunpowder, was, at, first, used, as, an, incendiary, and, only, later, became, an, explosive, and, a, propellant, in, contrast, formulas, in, europe, diverged, only, very, slightly, from, the, ideal, proportions, for, use, as, an, explosive, and, a, propellant, suggesting, that, gunpowder, was, introduced, as, a, mature, technology, however, the, history, of, gunpowder, is, not, without, controversy, a, major, problem, confronting, the, study, of, early, gunpowder, history, is, ready, access, to, sources, close, to, the, events, described, often, the, first, records, potentially, describing, use, of, gunpowder, in, warfare, were, written, several, centuries, after, the, fact, and, may, well, have, been, colored, by, the, contemporary, experiences, of, the, chronicler, translation, difficulties, have, led, to, errors, or, loose, interpretations, bordering, on, artistic, licence, ambiguous, language, can, make, it, difficult, to, distinguish, gunpowder, weapons, from, similar, technologies, that, do, not, rely, on, gunpowder, a, commonly, cited, example, is, a, report, of, the, battle, of, mohi, in, eastern, europe, that, mentions, a, long, lance, sending, forth, evil, smelling, vapors, and, smoke, which, has, been, variously, interpreted, by, different, historians, as, the, first, gas, attack, upon, european, soil, using, gunpowder, the, first, use, of, cannon, in, europe, or, merely, a, toxic, gas, with, no, evidence, of, gunpowder, it, is, difficult, to, accurately, translate, original, chinese, alchemical, texts, which, tend, to, explain, phenomena, through, metaphor, into, modern, scientific, language, with, rigidly, defined, terminology, in, english, early, texts, potentially, mentioning, gunpowder, are, sometimes, marked, by, a, linguistic, process, where, semantic, change, occurred, for, instance, the, arabic, word, naft, transitioned, from, denoting, naphtha, to, denoting, gunpowder, and, the, chinese, word, p, o, changed, in, meaning, from, trebuchet, to, a, cannon, this, has, led, to, arguments, on, the, exact, origins, of, gunpowder, based, on, etymological, foundations, science, and, technology, historian, bert, s, hall, makes, the, observation, that, it, goes, without, saying, however, that, historians, bent, on, special, pleading, or, simply, with, axes, of, their, own, to, grind, can, find, rich, material, in, these, terminological, thickets, another, major, area, of, contention, in, modern, studies, of, the, history, of, gunpowder, is, regarding, the, transmission, of, gunpowder, while, the, literary, and, archaeological, evidence, supports, a, chinese, origin, for, gunpowder, and, guns, the, manner, in, which, gunpowder, technology, was, transferred, from, china, to, the, west, is, still, under, debate, it, is, unknown, why, the, rapid, spread, of, gunpowder, technology, across, eurasia, took, place, over, several, decades, whereas, other, technologies, such, as, paper, the, compass, and, printing, did, not, reach, europe, until, centuries, after, they, were, invented, in, china, gunpowder, is, a, granular, mixture, of, potassium, nitrate, is, the, most, important, ingredient, in, terms, of, both, bulk, and, function, because, the, combustion, process, releases, oxygen, from, the, potassium, nitrate, promoting, the, rapid, burning, of, the, other, ingredients, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, accidental, ignition, by, static, electricity, the, granules, of, modern, gunpowder, are, typically, coated, with, graphite, which, prevents, the, build, up, of, electrostatic, charge, charcoal, does, not, consist, of, pure, carbon, rather, it, consists, of, partially, pyrolyzed, cellulose, in, which, the, wood, is, not, completely, decomposed, carbon, differs, from, ordinary, charcoal, whereas, charcoal, s, autoignition, temperature, is, relatively, low, carbon, s, is, much, greater, thus, a, gunpowder, composition, containing, pure, carbon, would, burn, similarly, to, a, match, head, at, best, the, current, standard, composition, for, the, gunpowder, manufactured, by, pyrotechnicians, was, adopted, as, long, ago, as, 1780, proportions, by, weight, are, 75, potassium, nitrate, known, as, saltpeter, or, saltpetre, 15, softwood, charcoal, and, 10, sulfur, these, ratios, have, varied, over, the, centuries, and, by, country, and, can, be, altered, somewhat, depending, on, the, purpose, of, the, powder, for, instance, power, grades, of, black, powder, unsuitable, for, use, in, firearms, but, adequate, for, blasting, rock, in, quarrying, operations, are, called, blasting, powder, rather, than, gunpowder, with, standard, proportions, of, 70, nitrate, 14, charcoal, and, 16, sulfur, blasting, powder, may, be, made, with, the, cheaper, sodium, nitrate, substituted, for, potassium, nitrate, and, proportions, may, be, as, low, as, 40, nitrate, 30, charcoal, and, 30, sulfur, in, 1857, lammot, du, pont, solved, the, main, problem, of, using, cheaper, sodium, nitrate, formulations, when, he, patented, dupont, b, blasting, powder, after, manufacturing, grains, from, press, cake, in, the, usual, way, his, process, tumbled, the, powder, with, graphite, dust, for, 12, hours, this, formed, a, graphite, coating, on, each, grain, that, reduced, its, ability, to, absorb, moisture, neither, the, use, of, graphite, nor, sodium, nitrate, was, new, glossing, gunpowder, corns, with, graphite, was, already, an, accepted, technique, in, 1839, and, sodium, nitrate, based, blasting, powder, had, been, made, in, peru, for, many, years, using, the, sodium, nitrate, mined, at, tarapac, now, in, chile, also, in, 1846, two, plants, were, built, in, south, west, england, to, make, blasting, powder, using, this, sodium, nitrate, the, idea, may, well, have, been, brought, from, peru, by, cornish, miners, returning, home, after, completing, their, contracts, another, suggestion, is, that, it, was, william, lobb, the, plant, collector, who, recognised, the, possibilities, of, sodium, nitrate, during, his, travels, in, south, america, lammot, du, pont, would, have, known, about, the, use, of, graphite, and, probably, also, knew, about, the, plants, in, south, west, england, in, his, patent, he, was, careful, to, state, that, his, claim, was, for, the, combination, of, graphite, with, sodium, nitrate, based, powder, rather, than, for, either, of, the, two, individual, technologies, french, war, powder, in, 1879, used, the, ratio, 75, saltpeter, 12, 5, charcoal, 12, 5, sulfur, english, war, powder, in, 1879, used, the, ratio, 75, saltpeter, 15, charcoal, 10, sulfur, the, british, congreve, rockets, used, 62, 4, saltpeter, 23, 2, charcoal, and, 14, 4, sulfur, but, the, british, mark, vii, gunpowder, was, changed, to, 65, saltpeter, 20, charcoal, and, 15, sulfur, the, explanation, for, the, wide, variety, in, formulation, relates, to, usage, powder, used, for, rocketry, can, use, a, slower, burn, rate, since, it, accelerates, the, projectile, for, a, much, longer, time, whereas, powders, for, weapons, such, as, flintlocks, cap, locks, or, matchlocks, need, a, higher, burn, rate, to, accelerate, the, projectile, in, a, much, shorter, distance, cannons, usually, used, lower, burn, rate, powders, because, most, would, burst, with, higher, burn, rate, powders, besides, black, powder, there, are, other, historically, important, types, of, gunpowder, brown, gunpowder, is, cited, as, composed, of, 79, nitre, 3, sulfur, and, 18, charcoal, per, 100, of, dry, powder, with, about, 2, moisture, prismatic, brown, powder, is, a, large, grained, product, the, rottweil, company, introduced, in, 1884, in, germany, which, was, adopted, by, the, british, royal, navy, shortly, thereafter, the, french, navy, adopted, a, fine, 3, 1, millimeter, not, prismatic, grained, product, called, slow, burning, cocoa, sbc, or, cocoa, powder, these, brown, powders, reduced, burning, rate, even, further, by, using, as, little, as, 2, percent, sulfur, and, using, charcoal, made, from, rye, straw, that, had, not, been, completely, charred, hence, the, brown, color, lesmok, powder, was, a, product, developed, by, dupont, in, 1911, one, of, several, semi, smokeless, products, in, the, industry, containing, a, mixture, of, black, and, nitrocellulose, powder, it, was, sold, to, winchester, and, others, primarily, for, 22, and, 32, small, calibers, its, advantage, was, that, it, was, believed, at, the, time, to, be, less, corrosive, than, smokeless, powders, then, in, use, it, was, not, understood, in, the, u, s, until, the, 1920s, that, the, actual, source, of, corrosion, was, the, potassium, chloride, residue, from, potassium, chlorate, sensitized, primers, the, bulkier, black, powder, fouling, better, disperses, primer, residue, failure, to, mitigate, primer, corrosion, by, dispersion, caused, the, false, impression, that, nitrocellulose, based, powder, caused, corrosion, lesmok, had, some, of, the, bulk, of, black, powder, for, dispersing, primer, residue, but, somewhat, less, total, bulk, than, straight, black, powder, thus, requiring, less, frequent, bore, cleaning, it, was, last, sold, by, winchester, in, 1947, the, development, of, smokeless, powders, such, as, cordite, in, the, late, 19th, century, created, the, need, for, a, spark, sensitive, priming, charge, such, as, gunpowder, however, the, sulfur, content, of, traditional, gunpowders, caused, corrosion, problems, with, cordite, mk, i, and, this, led, to, the, introduction, of, a, range, of, sulfur, free, gunpowders, of, varying, grain, sizes, they, typically, contain, 70, 5, parts, of, saltpeter, and, 29, 5, parts, of, charcoal, like, black, powder, they, were, produced, in, different, grain, sizes, in, the, united, kingdom, the, finest, grain, was, known, as, sulfur, free, mealed, powder, smp, coarser, grains, were, numbered, as, sulfur, free, gunpowder, sfg, n, sfg, 12, sfg, 20, sfg, 40, and, sfg, 90, for, example, where, the, number, represents, the, smallest, bss, sieve, mesh, size, which, retained, no, grains, sulfur, s, main, role, in, gunpowder, is, to, decrease, the, ignition, temperature, a, sample, reaction, for, sulfur, free, gunpowder, would, be, the, term, black, powder, was, coined, in, the, late, 19th, century, primarily, in, the, united, states, to, distinguish, prior, gunpowder, formulations, from, the, new, smokeless, powders, and, semi, smokeless, powders, semi, smokeless, powders, featured, bulk, volume, properties, that, approximated, black, powder, but, had, significantly, reduced, amounts, of, smoke, and, combustion, products, smokeless, powder, has, different, burning, properties, pressure, vs, time, and, can, generate, higher, pressures, and, work, per, gram, this, can, rupture, older, weapons, designed, for, black, powder, smokeless, powders, ranged, in, color, from, brownish, tan, to, yellow, to, white, most, of, the, bulk, semi, smokeless, powders, ceased, to, be, manufactured, in, the, 1920s, the, original, dry, compounded, powder, used, in, 15th, century, europe, was, known, as, serpentine, either, a, reference, to, satan, or, to, a, common, artillery, piece, that, used, it, the, ingredients, were, ground, together, with, a, mortar, and, pestle, perhaps, for, 24, hours, resulting, in, a, fine, flour, vibration, during, transportation, could, cause, the, components, to, separate, again, requiring, remixing, in, the, field, also, if, the, quality, of, the, saltpeter, was, low, for, instance, if, it, was, contaminated, with, highly, hygroscopic, calcium, nitrate, or, if, the, powder, was, simply, old, due, to, the, mildly, hygroscopic, nature, of, potassium, nitrate, in, humid, weather, it, would, need, to, be, re, dried, the, dust, from, repairing, powder, in, the, field, was, a, major, hazard, loading, cannons, or, bombards, before, the, powder, making, advances, of, the, renaissance, was, a, skilled, art, fine, powder, loaded, haphazardly, or, too, tightly, would, burn, incompletely, or, too, slowly, typically, the, breech, loading, powder, chamber, in, the, rear, of, the, piece, was, filled, only, about, half, full, the, serpentine, powder, neither, too, compressed, nor, too, loose, a, wooden, bung, pounded, in, to, seal, the, chamber, from, the, barrel, when, assembled, and, the, projectile, placed, on, a, carefully, determined, empty, space, was, necessary, for, the, charge, to, burn, effectively, when, the, cannon, was, fired, through, the, touchhole, turbulence, from, the, initial, surface, combustion, caused, the, rest, of, the, powder, to, be, rapidly, exposed, to, the, flame, the, advent, of, much, more, powerful, and, easy, to, use, corned, powder, changed, this, procedure, but, serpentine, was, used, with, older, guns, into, the, 17th, century, for, propellants, to, oxidize, and, burn, rapidly, and, effectively, the, combustible, ingredients, must, be, reduced, to, the, smallest, possible, particle, sizes, and, be, as, thoroughly, mixed, as, possible, once, mixed, however, for, better, results, in, a, gun, makers, discovered, that, the, final, product, should, be, in, the, form, of, individual, dense, grains, that, spread, the, fire, quickly, from, grain, to, grain, much, as, straw, or, twigs, catch, fire, more, quickly, than, a, pile, of, sawdust, in, late, 14th, century, europe, and, china, gunpowder, was, improved, by, wet, grinding, liquid, such, as, distilled, spirits, were, added, during, the, grinding, together, of, the, ingredients, and, the, moist, paste, dried, afterwards, the, principle, of, wet, mixing, to, prevent, the, separation, of, dry, ingredients, invented, for, gunpowder, is, used, today, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, it, was, discovered, that, if, the, paste, was, rolled, into, balls, before, drying, the, resulting, gunpowder, absorbed, less, water, from, the, air, during, storage, and, traveled, better, the, balls, were, then, crushed, in, a, mortar, by, the, gunner, immediately, before, use, with, the, old, problem, of, uneven, particle, size, and, packing, causing, unpredictable, results, if, the, right, size, particles, were, chosen, however, the, result, was, a, great, improvement, in, power, forming, the, damp, paste, into, corn, sized, clumps, by, hand, or, with, the, use, of, a, sieve, instead, of, larger, balls, produced, a, product, after, drying, that, loaded, much, better, as, each, tiny, piece, provided, its, own, surrounding, air, space, that, allowed, much, more, rapid, combustion, than, a, fine, powder, this, corned, gunpowder, was, from, 30, to, 300, more, powerful, an, example, is, cited, where, 15, kilograms, 34, lb, of, serpentine, was, needed, to, shoot, a, 21, kilogram, 47, lb, ball, but, only, 8, 2, kilograms, 18, lb, of, corned, powder, because, the, dry, powdered, ingredients, must, be, mixed, and, bonded, together, for, extrusion, and, cut, into, grains, to, maintain, the, blend, size, reduction, and, mixing, is, done, while, the, ingredients, are, damp, usually, with, water, after, 1800, instead, of, forming, grains, by, hand, or, with, sieves, the, damp, mill, cake, was, pressed, in, molds, to, increase, its, density, and, extract, the, liquid, forming, press, cake, the, pressing, took, varying, amounts, of, time, depending, on, conditions, such, as, atmospheric, humidity, the, hard, dense, product, was, broken, again, into, tiny, pieces, which, were, separated, with, sieves, to, produce, a, uniform, product, for, each, purpose, coarse, powders, for, cannons, finer, grained, powders, for, muskets, and, the, finest, for, small, hand, guns, and, priming, inappropriately, fine, grained, powder, often, caused, cannons, to, burst, before, the, projectile, could, move, down, the, barrel, due, to, the, high, initial, spike, in, pressure, mammoth, powder, with, large, grains, made, for, rodman, s, 15, inch, cannon, reduced, the, pressure, to, only, 20, percent, as, high, as, ordinary, cannon, powder, would, have, produced, in, the, mid, 19th, century, measurements, were, made, determining, that, the, burning, rate, within, a, grain, of, black, powder, or, a, tightly, packed, mass, is, about, 6, cm, s, 0, 20, feet, s, while, the, rate, of, ignition, propagation, from, grain, to, grain, is, around, 9, m, s, 30, feet, s, over, two, orders, of, magnitude, faster, modern, corning, first, compresses, the, fine, black, powder, meal, into, blocks, with, a, fixed, density, 1, 7, g, cm, 3, in, the, united, states, gunpowder, grains, were, designated, f, for, fine, or, c, for, coarse, grain, diameter, decreased, with, a, larger, number, of, fs, and, increased, with, a, larger, number, of, cs, ranging, from, about, 2, mm, 1, 16, in, for, 7f, to, 15, mm, 9, 16, in, for, 7c, even, larger, grains, were, produced, for, artillery, bore, diameters, greater, than, about, 17, cm, 6, 7, in, the, standard, dupont, mammoth, powder, developed, by, thomas, rodman, and, lammot, du, pont, for, use, during, the, american, civil, war, had, grains, averaging, 15, mm, 0, 6, in, in, diameter, with, edges, rounded, in, a, glazing, barrel, other, versions, had, grains, the, size, of, golf, and, tennis, balls, for, use, in, 20, inch, 51, cm, rodman, guns, in, 1875, dupont, introduced, hexagonal, powder, for, large, artillery, which, was, pressed, using, shaped, plates, with, a, small, center, core, about, 38, mm, 1, 1, 2, in, diameter, like, a, wagon, wheel, nut, the, center, hole, widened, as, the, grain, burned, by, 1882, german, makers, also, produced, hexagonal, grained, powders, of, a, similar, size, for, artillery, by, the, late, 19th, century, manufacturing, focused, on, standard, grades, of, black, powder, from, fg, used, in, large, bore, rifles, and, shotguns, through, ffg, medium, and, small, bore, arms, such, as, muskets, and, fusils, fffg, small, bore, rifles, and, pistols, and, ffffg, extreme, small, bore, short, pistols, and, most, commonly, for, priming, flintlocks, a, coarser, grade, for, use, in, military, artillery, blanks, was, designated, a, 1, these, grades, were, sorted, on, a, system, of, screens, with, oversize, retained, on, a, mesh, of, 6, wires, per, inch, a, 1, retained, on, 10, wires, per, inch, fg, retained, on, 14, ffg, on, 24, fffg, on, 46, and, ffffg, on, 60, fines, designated, fffffg, were, usually, reprocessed, to, minimize, explosive, dust, hazards, in, the, united, kingdom, the, main, service, gunpowders, were, classified, rfg, rifle, grained, fine, with, diameter, of, one, or, two, millimeters, and, rlg, rifle, grained, large, for, grain, diameters, between, two, and, six, millimeters, gunpowder, grains, can, alternatively, be, categorized, by, mesh, size, the, bss, sieve, mesh, size, being, the, smallest, mesh, size, which, retains, no, grains, recognized, grain, sizes, are, gunpowder, g, 7, g, 20, g, 40, and, g, 90, owing, to, the, large, market, of, antique, and, replica, black, powder, firearms, in, the, us, modern, black, powder, substitutes, like, pyrodex, triple, seven, and, black, mag3, pellets, have, been, developed, since, the, 1970s, these, products, which, should, not, be, confused, with, smokeless, powders, aim, to, produce, less, fouling, solid, residue, while, maintaining, the, traditional, volumetric, measurement, system, for, charges, claims, of, less, corrosiveness, of, these, products, have, been, controversial, however, new, cleaning, products, for, black, powder, guns, have, also, been, developed, for, this, market, a, simple, commonly, cited, chemical, equation, for, the, combustion, of, gunpowder, is, a, balanced, but, still, simplified, equation, is, the, exact, percentages, of, ingredients, varied, greatly, through, the, medieval, period, as, the, recipes, were, developed, by, trial, and, error, and, needed, to, be, updated, for, changing, military, technology, gunpowder, does, not, burn, as, a, single, reaction, so, the, byproducts, are, not, easily, predicted, one, study, showed, that, it, produced, in, order, of, descending, quantities, 55, 91, solid, products, potassium, carbonate, potassium, sulfate, potassium, sulfide, sulfur, potassium, nitrate, potassium, thiocyanate, carbon, ammonium, carbonate, and, 42, 98, gaseous, products, carbon, dioxide, nitrogen, carbon, monoxide, hydrogen, sulfide, hydrogen, methane, 1, 11, water, gunpowder, made, with, less, expensive, and, more, plentiful, sodium, nitrate, instead, of, potassium, nitrate, in, appropriate, proportions, works, just, as, well, however, it, is, more, hygroscopic, than, powders, made, from, potassium, nitrate, muzzleloaders, have, been, known, to, fire, after, hanging, on, a, wall, for, decades, in, a, loaded, state, provided, they, remained, dry, by, contrast, gunpowder, made, with, sodium, nitrate, must, be, kept, sealed, to, remain, stable, gunpowder, releases, 3, megajoules, per, kilogram, and, contains, its, own, oxidant, this, is, less, than, tnt, 4, 7, megajoules, per, kilogram, or, gasoline, 47, 2, megajoules, per, kilogram, in, combustion, but, gasoline, requires, an, oxidant, for, instance, an, optimized, gasoline, and, o, 2, mixture, releases, 10, 4, megajoules, per, kilogram, taking, into, account, the, mass, of, the, oxygen, gunpowder, also, has, a, low, energy, density, compared, to, modern, smokeless, powders, and, thus, to, achieve, high, energy, loadings, large, amounts, are, needed, with, heavy, projectiles, for, the, most, powerful, black, powder, meal, powder, a, wood, charcoal, is, used, the, best, wood, for, the, purpose, is, pacific, willow, but, others, such, as, alder, or, buckthorn, can, be, used, in, great, britain, between, the, 15th, and, 19th, centuries, charcoal, from, alder, buckthorn, was, greatly, prized, for, gunpowder, manufacture, cottonwood, was, used, by, the, american, confederate, states, the, ingredients, are, reduced, in, particle, size, and, mixed, as, intimately, as, possible, originally, this, was, with, a, mortar, and, pestle, or, a, similarly, operating, stamping, mill, using, copper, bronze, or, other, non, sparking, materials, until, supplanted, by, the, rotating, ball, mill, principle, with, non, sparking, bronze, or, lead, historically, a, marble, or, limestone, edge, runner, mill, running, on, a, limestone, bed, was, used, in, great, britain, however, by, the, mid, 19th, century, this, had, changed, to, either, an, iron, shod, stone, wheel, or, a, cast, iron, wheel, running, on, an, iron, bed, the, mix, was, dampened, with, alcohol, or, water, during, grinding, to, prevent, accidental, ignition, this, also, helps, the, extremely, soluble, saltpeter, to, mix, into, the, microscopic, pores, of, the, very, high, surface, area, charcoal, around, the, late, 14th, century, european, powdermakers, first, began, adding, liquid, during, grinding, to, improve, mixing, reduce, dust, and, with, it, the, risk, of, explosion, the, powder, makers, would, then, shape, the, resulting, paste, of, dampened, gunpowder, known, as, mill, cake, into, corns, or, grains, to, dry, not, only, did, corned, powder, keep, better, because, of, its, reduced, surface, area, gunners, also, found, that, it, was, more, powerful, and, easier, to, load, into, guns, before, long, powder, makers, standardized, the, process, by, forcing, mill, cake, through, sieves, instead, of, corning, powder, by, hand, the, improvement, was, based, on, reducing, the, surface, area, of, a, higher, density, composition, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, makers, increased, density, further, by, static, pressing, they, shoveled, damp, mill, cake, into, a, two, foot, square, box, placed, this, beneath, a, screw, press, and, reduced, it, to, half, its, volume, press, cake, had, the, hardness, of, slate, they, broke, the, dried, slabs, with, hammers, or, rollers, and, sorted, the, granules, with, sieves, into, different, grades, in, the, united, states, eleuthere, irenee, du, pont, who, had, learned, the, trade, from, lavoisier, tumbled, the, dried, grains, in, rotating, barrels, to, round, the, edges, and, increase, durability, during, shipping, and, handling, sharp, grains, rounded, off, in, transport, producing, fine, meal, dust, that, changed, the, burning, properties, another, advance, was, the, manufacture, of, kiln, charcoal, by, distilling, wood, in, heated, iron, retorts, instead, of, burning, it, in, earthen, pits, controlling, the, temperature, influenced, the, power, and, consistency, of, the, finished, gunpowder, in, 1863, in, response, to, high, prices, for, indian, saltpeter, dupont, chemists, developed, a, process, using, potash, or, mined, potassium, chloride, to, convert, plentiful, chilean, sodium, nitrate, to, potassium, nitrate, the, following, year, 1864, the, gatebeck, low, gunpowder, works, in, cumbria, great, britain, started, a, plant, to, manufacture, potassium, nitrate, by, essentially, the, same, chemical, process, this, is, nowadays, called, the, wakefield, process, after, the, owners, of, the, company, it, would, have, used, potassium, chloride, from, the, sta, furt, mines, near, magdeburg, germany, which, had, recently, become, available, in, industrial, quantities, during, the, 18th, century, gunpowder, factories, became, increasingly, dependent, on, mechanical, energy, despite, mechanization, production, difficulties, related, to, humidity, control, especially, during, the, pressing, were, still, present, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, paper, from, 1885, laments, that, gunpowder, is, such, a, nervous, and, sensitive, spirit, that, in, almost, every, process, of, manufacture, it, changes, under, our, hands, as, the, weather, changes, pressing, times, to, the, desired, density, could, vary, by, a, factor, of, three, depending, on, the, atmospheric, humidity, the, united, nations, model, regulations, on, the, transportation, of, dangerous, goods, and, national, transportation, authorities, such, as, united, states, department, of, transportation, have, classified, gunpowder, black, powder, as, a, group, a, primary, explosive, substance, for, shipment, because, it, ignites, so, easily, complete, manufactured, devices, containing, black, powder, are, usually, classified, as, group, d, secondary, detonating, substance, or, black, powder, or, article, containing, secondary, detonating, substance, such, as, firework, class, d, model, rocket, engine, etc, for, shipment, because, they, are, harder, to, ignite, than, loose, powder, as, explosives, they, all, fall, into, the, category, of, class, 1, besides, its, use, as, a, propellant, in, firearms, and, artillery, black, powder, s, other, main, use, has, been, as, a, blasting, powder, in, quarrying, mining, and, road, construction, including, railroad, construction, during, the, 19th, century, outside, of, war, emergencies, such, as, the, crimean, war, or, the, american, civil, war, more, black, powder, was, used, in, these, industrial, uses, than, in, firearms, and, artillery, dynamite, gradually, replaced, it, for, those, uses, today, industrial, explosives, for, such, uses, are, still, a, huge, market, but, most, of, the, market, is, in, newer, explosives, rather, than, black, powder, beginning, in, the, 1930s, gunpowder, or, smokeless, powder, was, used, in, rivet, guns, stun, guns, for, animals, cable, splicers, and, other, industrial, construction, tools, the, stud, gun, a, powder, actuated, tool, drove, nails, or, screws, into, solid, concrete, a, function, not, possible, with, hydraulic, tools, and, today, is, still, an, important, part, of, various, industries, but, the, cartridges, usually, use, smokeless, powders, industrial, shotguns, have, been, used, to, eliminate, persistent, material, rings, in, operating, rotary, kilns, such, as, those, for, cement, lime, phosphate, etc, and, clinker, in, operating, furnaces, and, commercial, tools, make, the, method, more, reliable, gunpowder, has, occasionally, been, employed, for, other, purposes, besides, weapons, mining, fireworks, and, construction, gunpowder, had, originally, been, produced, for, medicinal, purposes, it, was, eaten, in, hopes, of, curing, digestive, ailments, inhaled, for, respiratory, disorders, and, as, mentioned, rubbed, onto, skin, level, disorders, like, rashes, or, burns
