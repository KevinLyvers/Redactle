air, conditioning, often, abbreviated, as, a, c, us, or, air, con, uk, is, the, process, of, removing, heat, from, an, enclosed, space, to, achieve, a, more, comfortable, interior, temperature, sometimes, referred, to, as, comfort, cooling, and, in, some, cases, also, strictly, controlling, the, humidity, of, internal, air, air, conditioning, can, be, achieved, using, a, mechanical, air, conditioner, or, by, other, methods, including, passive, cooling, and, ventilative, cooling, air, conditioning, is, a, member, of, a, family, of, systems, and, techniques, that, provide, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, heat, pumps, are, similar, in, many, ways, to, air, conditioners, but, use, a, reversing, valve, to, allow, them, both, to, heat, and, to, cool, an, enclosed, space, air, conditioners, which, typically, use, vapor, compression, refrigeration, range, in, size, from, small, units, used, in, vehicles, or, single, rooms, to, massive, units, that, can, cool, large, buildings, air, source, heat, pumps, which, can, be, used, for, heating, as, well, as, cooling, are, becoming, increasingly, common, in, cooler, climates, air, conditioners, can, reduce, mortality, rates, due, to, higher, temperature, according, to, the, international, energy, agency, iea, 1, 6, billion, air, conditioning, units, were, used, globally, in, 2016, the, united, nations, called, for, the, technology, to, be, made, more, sustainable, to, mitigate, climate, change, and, for, the, use, of, alternatives, like, passive, cooling, evaporative, cooling, selective, shading, windcatchers, and, better, thermal, insulation, air, conditioning, dates, back, to, prehistory, double, walled, living, quarters, with, a, gap, between, the, two, walls, to, encourage, air, flow, were, found, in, the, ancient, city, of, hamoukar, in, modern, syria, ancient, egyptian, buildings, also, used, a, wide, variety, of, passive, air, conditioning, techniques, these, became, widespread, from, the, iberian, peninsula, through, north, africa, the, middle, east, and, northern, india, passive, techniques, remained, widespread, until, the, 20th, century, when, they, fell, out, of, fashion, and, were, replaced, by, powered, air, conditioning, using, information, from, engineering, studies, of, traditional, buildings, passive, techniques, are, being, revived, and, modified, for, 21st, century, architectural, designs, air, conditioners, allow, the, building, s, indoor, environment, to, remain, relatively, constant, largely, independent, of, changes, in, external, weather, conditions, and, internal, heat, loads, they, also, enable, deep, plan, buildings, to, be, created, and, have, allowed, people, to, live, comfortably, in, hotter, parts, of, the, world, but, have, now, come, under, criticism, for, contributing, significantly, to, climate, change, due, to, their, high, electricity, consumption, and, the, warming, of, their, immediate, surroundings, in, large, cities, in, 1558, giambattista, della, porta, described, a, method, of, chilling, ice, to, temperatures, far, below, its, freezing, point, by, mixing, it, with, potassium, nitrate, then, called, nitre, in, his, popular, science, book, natural, magic, in, 1620, cornelis, drebbel, demonstrated, turning, summer, into, winter, for, james, i, of, england, chilling, part, of, the, great, hall, of, westminster, abbey, with, an, apparatus, of, troughs, and, vats, drebbel, s, contemporary, francis, bacon, like, della, porta, a, believer, in, science, communication, may, not, have, been, present, at, the, demonstration, but, in, a, book, published, later, the, same, year, he, described, it, as, experiment, of, artificial, freezing, and, said, that, nitre, or, rather, its, spirit, is, very, cold, and, hence, nitre, or, salt, when, added, to, snow, or, ice, intensifies, the, cold, of, the, latter, the, nitre, by, adding, to, its, cold, but, the, salt, by, supplying, activity, to, the, cold, of, the, snow, in, 1758, benjamin, franklin, and, john, hadley, a, chemistry, professor, at, the, university, of, cambridge, conducted, experiments, applying, the, principle, of, evaporation, as, a, means, to, cool, an, object, rapidly, franklin, and, hadley, confirmed, that, the, evaporation, of, highly, volatile, liquids, such, as, alcohol, and, ether, could, be, used, to, drive, down, the, temperature, of, an, object, past, the, freezing, point, of, water, they, experimented, with, the, bulb, of, a, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, as, their, object, they, used, a, bellows, to, speed, up, the, evaporation, they, lowered, the, temperature, of, the, thermometer, bulb, down, to, 14, c, 7, f, while, the, ambient, temperature, was, 18, c, 64, f, franklin, noted, that, soon, after, they, passed, the, freezing, point, of, water, 0, c, 32, f, a, thin, film, of, ice, formed, on, the, surface, of, the, thermometer, s, bulb, and, that, the, ice, mass, was, about, 6, mm, 1, 4, in, thick, when, they, stopped, the, experiment, upon, reaching, 14, c, 7, f, franklin, concluded, from, this, experiment, one, may, see, the, possibility, of, freezing, a, man, to, death, on, a, warm, summer, s, day, the, 19th, century, included, many, developments, in, compression, technology, in, 1820, english, scientist, and, inventor, michael, faraday, discovered, that, compressing, and, liquefying, ammonia, could, chill, air, when, the, liquefied, ammonia, was, allowed, to, evaporate, in, 1842, florida, physician, john, gorrie, used, compressor, technology, to, create, ice, which, he, used, to, cool, air, for, his, patients, in, his, hospital, in, apalachicola, florida, he, hoped, to, eventually, use, his, ice, making, machine, to, regulate, the, temperature, of, buildings, he, envisioned, centralized, air, conditioning, that, could, cool, entire, cities, gorrie, was, granted, a, patent, in, 1851, but, following, the, death, of, his, main, backer, he, was, not, able, to, realize, his, invention, in, 1851, james, harrison, created, the, first, mechanical, ice, making, machine, in, geelong, australia, and, was, granted, a, patent, for, an, ether, vapor, compression, refrigeration, system, in, 1855, that, produced, three, tons, of, ice, per, day, in, 1860, harrison, established, a, second, ice, company, he, later, entered, the, debate, over, competing, against, the, american, advantage, of, ice, refrigerated, beef, sales, to, the, united, kingdom, electricity, made, the, development, of, effective, units, possible, in, 1901, american, inventor, willis, h, carrier, built, what, is, considered, the, first, modern, electrical, air, conditioning, unit, in, 1902, he, installed, his, first, air, conditioning, system, in, the, sackett, wilhelms, lithographing, publishing, company, in, brooklyn, new, york, his, invention, controlled, both, the, temperature, and, humidity, which, helped, maintain, consistent, paper, dimensions, and, ink, alignment, at, the, printing, plant, later, together, with, six, other, employees, carrier, formed, the, carrier, air, conditioning, company, of, america, a, business, that, in, 2020, employed, 53, 000, people, and, was, valued, at, 18, 6, billion, in, 1906, stuart, w, cramer, of, charlotte, north, carolina, was, exploring, ways, to, add, moisture, to, the, air, in, his, textile, mill, cramer, coined, the, term, air, conditioning, in, a, patent, claim, which, he, filed, that, year, where, he, suggested, that, air, conditioning, was, analogous, to, water, conditioning, then, a, well, known, process, for, making, textiles, easier, to, process, he, combined, moisture, with, ventilation, to, condition, and, change, the, air, in, the, factories, thus, controlling, the, humidity, that, is, necessary, in, textile, plants, willis, carrier, adopted, the, term, and, incorporated, it, into, the, name, of, his, company, domestic, air, conditioning, soon, took, off, in, 1914, the, first, domestic, air, conditioning, was, installed, in, minneapolis, in, the, home, of, charles, gilbert, gates, it, is, however, possible, that, the, considerable, device, c, 2, 1, m, 1, 8, m, 6, 1, m, 7, ft, 6, ft, 20, ft, was, never, used, as, the, house, remained, uninhabited, gates, had, already, died, in, october, 1913, in, 1931, h, h, schultz, and, j, q, sherman, developed, what, would, become, the, most, common, type, of, individual, room, air, conditioner, one, designed, to, sit, on, a, window, ledge, the, units, went, on, sale, in, 1932, at, us, 10, 000, to, 50, 000, the, equivalent, of, 200, 000, to, 1, 100, 000, in, 2023, a, year, later, the, first, air, conditioning, systems, for, cars, were, offered, for, sale, chrysler, motors, introduced, the, first, practical, semi, portable, air, conditioning, unit, in, 1935, and, packard, became, the, first, automobile, manufacturer, to, offer, an, air, conditioning, unit, in, its, cars, in, 1939, innovations, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, allowed, more, ubiquitous, air, conditioner, use, in, 1945, robert, sherman, of, lynn, massachusetts, invented, a, portable, in, window, air, conditioner, that, cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and, filtered, the, air, the, first, inverter, air, conditioners, were, released, in, 1980, 1981, air, conditioner, adoption, tends, to, increase, above, around, 10, 000, annual, household, income, in, warmer, areas, global, gdp, growth, explains, around, 85, of, increased, air, condition, adoption, by, 2050, while, the, remaining, 15, can, be, explained, by, climate, change, as, of, 2016, an, estimated, 1, 6, billion, air, conditioning, units, were, used, worldwide, with, over, half, of, them, in, china, and, usa, and, a, total, cooling, capacity, of, 11, 675, gigawatts, the, international, energy, agency, predicted, in, 2018, that, the, number, of, air, conditioning, units, would, grow, to, around, 4, billion, units, by, 2050, and, that, the, total, cooling, capacity, would, grow, to, around, 23, 000, gw, with, the, biggest, increases, in, india, and, china, between, 1995, and, 2004, the, proportion, of, urban, households, in, china, with, air, conditioners, increased, from, 8, to, 70, as, of, 2015, nearly, 100, million, homes, or, about, 87, of, us, households, had, air, conditioning, systems, in, 2019, it, was, estimated, that, 90, of, new, single, family, homes, constructed, in, the, us, included, air, conditioning, ranging, from, 99, in, the, south, to, 62, in, the, west, cooling, in, traditional, air, conditioner, systems, is, accomplished, using, the, vapor, compression, cycle, which, uses, a, refrigerant, s, forced, circulation, and, phase, change, between, gas, and, liquid, to, transfer, heat, the, vapor, compression, cycle, can, occur, within, a, unitary, or, packaged, piece, of, equipment, or, within, a, chiller, that, is, connected, to, terminal, cooling, equipment, such, as, a, fan, coil, unit, in, an, air, handler, on, its, evaporator, side, and, heat, rejection, equipment, such, as, a, cooling, tower, on, its, condenser, side, an, air, source, heat, pump, shares, many, components, with, an, air, conditioning, system, but, includes, a, reversing, valve, which, allows, the, unit, to, be, used, to, heat, as, well, as, cool, a, space, air, conditioning, equipment, will, reduce, the, absolute, humidity, of, the, air, processed, by, the, system, if, the, surface, of, the, evaporator, coil, is, significantly, cooler, than, the, dew, point, of, the, surrounding, air, an, air, conditioner, designed, for, an, occupied, space, will, typically, achieve, a, 30, to, 60, relative, humidity, in, the, occupied, space, most, modern, air, conditioning, systems, feature, a, dehumidification, cycle, during, which, the, compressor, runs, at, the, same, time, the, fan, is, slowed, to, reduce, the, evaporator, temperature, and, condense, more, water, a, dehumidifier, uses, the, same, refrigeration, cycle, but, incorporates, both, the, evaporator, and, the, condenser, into, the, same, air, path, the, air, first, passes, over, the, evaporator, coil, where, it, is, cooled, and, dehumidified, before, passing, over, the, condenser, coil, where, it, is, warmed, again, before, it, is, released, back, into, the, room, free, cooling, can, sometimes, be, selected, when, the, external, air, is, cooler, than, the, internal, air, therefore, the, compressor, does, not, need, to, be, used, resulting, in, high, cooling, efficiencies, for, these, times, this, may, also, be, combined, with, seasonal, thermal, energy, storage, some, air, conditioning, systems, can, reverse, the, refrigeration, cycle, and, act, as, an, air, source, heat, pump, thus, heating, instead, of, cooling, the, indoor, environment, they, are, also, commonly, referred, to, as, reverse, cycle, air, conditioners, the, heat, pump, is, significantly, more, energy, efficient, than, electric, resistance, heating, because, it, moves, energy, from, air, or, groundwater, to, the, heated, space, and, the, heat, from, purchased, electrical, energy, when, the, heat, pump, is, in, heating, mode, the, indoor, evaporator, coil, switches, roles, and, becomes, the, condenser, coil, producing, heat, the, outdoor, condenser, unit, also, switches, roles, to, serve, as, the, evaporator, and, discharges, cold, air, colder, than, the, ambient, outdoor, air, most, air, source, heat, pumps, become, less, efficient, in, outdoor, temperatures, lower, than, 4, c, or, 40, f, this, is, partly, because, ice, forms, on, the, outdoor, unit, s, heat, exchanger, coil, which, blocks, air, flow, over, the, coil, to, compensate, for, this, the, heat, pump, system, must, temporarily, switch, back, into, the, regular, air, conditioning, mode, to, switch, the, outdoor, evaporator, coil, back, to, the, condenser, coil, to, heat, up, and, defrost, therefore, some, heat, pump, systems, will, have, electric, resistance, heating, in, the, indoor, air, path, that, is, activated, only, in, this, mode, to, compensate, for, the, temporary, indoor, air, cooling, which, would, otherwise, be, uncomfortable, in, the, winter, newer, models, have, improved, cold, weather, performance, with, efficient, heating, capacity, down, to, 14, f, 26, c, however, there, is, always, a, chance, that, the, humidity, that, condenses, on, the, heat, exchanger, of, the, outdoor, unit, could, freeze, even, in, models, that, have, improved, cold, weather, performance, requiring, a, defrosting, cycle, to, be, performed, the, icing, problem, becomes, much, more, severe, with, lower, outdoor, temperatures, so, heat, pumps, are, sometimes, installed, in, tandem, with, a, more, conventional, form, of, heating, such, as, an, electrical, heater, a, natural, gas, heating, oil, or, wood, burning, fireplace, or, central, heating, which, is, used, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, the, heat, pump, during, harsher, winter, temperatures, in, this, case, the, heat, pump, is, used, efficiently, during, milder, temperatures, and, the, system, is, switched, to, the, conventional, heat, source, when, the, outdoor, temperature, is, lower, the, coefficient, of, performance, cop, of, an, air, conditioning, system, is, a, ratio, of, useful, heating, or, cooling, provided, to, the, work, required, higher, cops, equate, to, lower, operating, costs, the, cop, usually, exceeds, 1, however, the, exact, value, is, highly, dependent, on, operating, conditions, especially, absolute, temperature, and, relative, temperature, between, sink, and, system, and, is, often, graphed, or, averaged, against, expected, conditions, air, conditioner, equipment, power, in, the, u, s, is, often, described, in, terms, of, tons, of, refrigeration, with, each, approximately, equal, to, the, cooling, power, of, one, short, ton, 2, 000, pounds, 910, kg, of, ice, melting, in, a, 24, hour, period, the, value, is, equal, to, 12, 000, btu, it, per, hour, or, 3, 517, watts, residential, central, air, systems, are, usually, from, 1, to, 5, tons, 3, 5, to, 18, kw, in, capacity, the, efficiency, of, air, conditioners, is, often, rated, by, the, seasonal, energy, efficiency, ratio, seer, which, is, defined, by, the, air, conditioning, heating, and, refrigeration, institute, in, its, 2008, standard, ahri, 210, 240, performance, rating, of, unitary, air, conditioning, and, air, source, heat, pump, equipment, a, similar, standard, is, the, european, seasonal, energy, efficiency, ratio, eseer, efficiency, is, strongly, affected, by, the, humidity, of, the, air, to, be, cooled, dehumidifying, the, air, before, attempting, to, cool, it, can, reduce, subsequent, cooling, costs, by, as, much, as, 90, percent, thus, reducing, dehumidifying, costs, can, materially, affect, overall, air, conditioning, costs, this, type, of, controller, uses, an, infrared, led, to, relay, commands, from, a, remote, control, to, the, air, conditioner, the, output, of, the, infrared, led, like, that, of, any, infrared, remote, is, invisible, to, the, human, eye, because, its, wavelength, is, beyond, the, range, of, visible, light, 940, nm, this, controller, is, commonly, used, on, mini, split, air, conditioners, because, it, is, simple, and, portable, some, window, and, ducted, central, air, conditioners, uses, it, as, well, a, wired, controller, also, called, a, wired, thermostat, is, a, device, that, controls, an, air, conditioner, by, switching, heating, or, cooling, on, or, off, it, uses, different, sensors, to, measure, temperatures, and, actuate, control, operations, mechanical, thermostats, commonly, use, bimetallic, strips, converting, a, temperature, change, into, mechanical, displacement, to, actuate, control, of, the, air, conditioner, electronic, thermostats, instead, use, a, thermistor, or, other, semiconductor, sensor, processing, temperature, change, as, electronic, signals, to, control, the, air, conditioner, these, controllers, are, usually, used, in, hotel, rooms, because, they, are, permanently, installed, into, a, wall, and, hard, wired, directly, into, the, air, conditioner, unit, eliminating, the, need, for, batteries, where, the, typical, capacity, is, in, kilowatt, as, follows, ductless, systems, often, mini, split, though, there, are, now, ducted, mini, split, typically, supply, conditioned, and, heated, air, to, a, single, or, a, few, rooms, of, a, building, without, ducts, and, in, a, decentralized, manner, multi, zone, or, multi, split, systems, are, a, common, application, of, ductless, systems, and, allow, up, to, eight, rooms, zones, or, locations, to, be, conditioned, independently, from, each, other, each, with, its, indoor, unit, and, simultaneously, from, a, single, outdoor, unit, the, first, mini, split, system, was, sold, in, 1961, by, toshiba, in, japan, and, the, first, wall, mounted, mini, split, air, conditioner, was, sold, in, 1968, in, japan, by, mitsubishi, electric, where, small, home, sizes, motivated, their, development, the, mitsubishi, model, was, the, first, air, conditioner, with, a, cross, flow, fan, in, 1969, the, first, mini, split, air, conditioner, was, sold, in, the, us, multi, zone, ductless, systems, were, invented, by, daikin, in, 1973, and, variable, refrigerant, flow, systems, which, can, be, thought, of, as, larger, multi, split, systems, were, also, invented, by, daikin, in, 1982, both, were, first, sold, in, japan, variable, refrigerant, flow, systems, when, compared, with, central, plant, cooling, from, an, air, handler, eliminate, the, need, for, large, cool, air, ducts, air, handlers, and, chillers, instead, cool, refrigerant, is, transported, through, much, smaller, pipes, to, the, indoor, units, in, the, spaces, to, be, conditioned, thus, allowing, for, less, space, above, dropped, ceilings, and, a, lower, structural, impact, while, also, allowing, for, more, individual, and, independent, temperature, control, of, spaces, the, outdoor, and, indoor, units, can, be, spread, across, the, building, variable, refrigerant, flow, indoor, units, can, also, be, turned, off, individually, in, unused, spaces, the, lower, start, up, power, of, vrf, s, dc, inverter, compressors, and, their, inherent, dc, power, requirements, also, allow, vrf, solar, powered, heat, pumps, to, be, run, using, dc, providing, solar, panels, split, system, central, air, conditioners, consist, of, two, heat, exchangers, an, outside, unit, the, condenser, from, which, heat, is, rejected, to, the, environment, and, an, internal, heat, exchanger, the, evaporator, or, fan, coil, unit, fcu, with, the, piped, refrigerant, being, circulated, between, the, two, the, fcu, is, then, connected, to, the, spaces, to, be, cooled, by, ventilation, ducts, large, central, cooling, plants, may, use, intermediate, coolant, such, as, chilled, water, pumped, into, air, handlers, or, fan, coil, units, near, or, in, the, spaces, to, be, cooled, which, then, duct, or, deliver, cold, air, into, the, spaces, to, be, conditioned, rather, than, ducting, cold, air, directly, to, these, spaces, from, the, plant, which, is, not, done, due, to, the, low, density, and, heat, capacity, of, air, which, would, require, impractically, large, ducts, the, chilled, water, is, cooled, by, chillers, in, the, plant, which, uses, a, refrigeration, cycle, to, cool, water, often, transferring, its, heat, to, the, atmosphere, even, in, liquid, cooled, chillers, through, the, use, of, cooling, towers, chillers, may, be, air, or, liquid, cooled, a, portable, system, has, an, indoor, unit, on, wheels, connected, to, an, outdoor, unit, via, flexible, pipes, similar, to, a, permanently, fixed, installed, unit, such, as, a, ductless, split, air, conditioner, hose, systems, which, can, be, monoblock, or, air, to, air, are, vented, to, the, outside, via, air, ducts, the, monoblock, type, collects, the, water, in, a, bucket, or, tray, and, stops, when, full, the, air, to, air, type, re, evaporates, the, water, discharges, it, through, the, ducted, hose, and, can, run, continuously, such, portable, units, draw, indoor, air, and, expel, it, outdoors, through, a, single, duct, negatively, impacting, their, overall, cooling, efficiency, many, portable, air, conditioners, come, with, heat, as, well, as, a, dehumidification, function, the, packaged, terminal, air, conditioner, ptac, through, the, wall, and, window, air, conditioners, are, similar, these, units, are, installed, on, a, window, frame, or, on, a, wall, opening, the, unit, usually, has, an, internal, partition, separating, its, indoor, and, outdoor, sides, which, contain, the, unit, s, condenser, and, evaporator, respectively, ptac, systems, may, be, adapted, to, provide, heating, in, cold, weather, either, directly, by, using, an, electric, strip, gas, or, other, heaters, or, by, reversing, the, refrigerant, flow, to, heat, the, interior, and, draw, heat, from, the, exterior, air, converting, the, air, conditioner, into, a, heat, pump, they, may, be, installed, in, a, wall, opening, with, the, help, of, a, special, sleeve, on, the, wall, and, a, custom, grill, that, is, flush, with, the, wall, and, window, air, conditioners, can, also, be, installed, in, a, window, but, without, a, custom, grill, packaged, air, conditioners, also, known, as, self, contained, units, are, central, systems, that, integrate, into, a, single, housing, all, the, components, of, a, split, central, system, and, deliver, air, possibly, through, ducts, to, the, spaces, to, be, cooled, depending, on, their, construction, they, may, be, outdoors, or, indoors, on, roofs, rooftop, units, draw, the, air, to, be, conditioned, from, inside, or, outside, a, building, and, be, water, or, air, cooled, often, outdoor, units, are, air, cooled, while, indoor, units, are, liquid, cooled, using, a, cooling, tower, medium, large, capacity, this, compressor, consists, of, a, crankcase, crankshaft, piston, rod, piston, piston, ring, cylinder, head, and, valves, this, compressor, uses, two, interleaving, scrolls, to, compress, the, refrigerant, it, consists, of, one, fixed, and, one, orbiting, scrolls, this, type, of, compressor, is, more, efficient, because, it, has, 70, percent, less, moving, parts, than, a, reciprocating, compressor, this, compressor, use, two, very, closely, meshing, spiral, rotors, to, compress, the, gas, the, gas, enters, at, the, suction, side, and, moves, through, the, threads, as, the, screws, rotate, the, meshing, rotors, force, the, gas, through, the, compressor, and, the, gas, exits, at, the, end, of, the, screws, the, working, area, is, the, inter, lobe, volume, between, the, male, and, female, rotors, it, is, larger, at, the, intake, end, and, decreases, along, the, length, of, the, rotors, until, the, exhaust, port, this, change, in, volume, is, the, compression, there, are, several, ways, to, modulate, the, cooling, capacity, in, refrigeration, or, air, conditioning, and, heating, systems, the, most, common, in, air, conditioning, are, on, off, cycling, hot, gas, bypass, use, or, not, of, liquid, injection, manifold, configurations, of, multiple, compressors, mechanical, modulation, also, called, digital, and, inverter, technology, hot, gas, bypass, involves, injecting, a, quantity, of, gas, from, discharge, to, the, suction, side, the, compressor, will, keep, operating, at, the, same, speed, but, due, to, the, bypass, the, refrigerant, mass, flow, circulating, with, the, system, is, reduced, and, thus, the, cooling, capacity, this, naturally, causes, the, compressor, to, run, uselessly, during, the, periods, when, the, bypass, is, operating, the, turn, down, capacity, varies, between, 0, and, 100, several, compressors, can, be, installed, in, the, system, to, provide, the, peak, cooling, capacity, each, compressor, can, run, or, not, in, order, to, stage, the, cooling, capacity, of, the, unit, the, turn, down, capacity, is, either, 0, 33, 66, or, 100, for, a, trio, configuration, and, either, 0, 50, or, 100, for, a, tandem, this, internal, mechanical, capacity, modulation, is, based, on, periodic, compression, process, with, a, control, valve, the, two, scroll, set, move, apart, stopping, the, compression, for, a, given, time, period, this, method, varies, refrigerant, flow, by, changing, the, average, time, of, compression, but, not, the, actual, speed, of, the, motor, despite, an, excellent, turndown, ratio, from, 10, to, 100, of, the, cooling, capacity, mechanically, modulated, scrolls, have, high, energy, consumption, as, the, motor, continuously, runs, this, system, uses, a, variable, frequency, drive, also, called, an, inverter, to, control, the, speed, of, the, compressor, the, refrigerant, flow, rate, is, changed, by, the, change, in, the, speed, of, the, compressor, the, turn, down, ratio, depends, on, the, system, configuration, and, manufacturer, it, modulates, from, 15, or, 25, up, to, 100, at, full, capacity, with, a, single, inverter, from, 12, to, 100, with, a, hybrid, tandem, this, method, is, the, most, efficient, way, to, modulate, an, air, conditioner, s, capacity, it, is, up, to, 58, more, efficient, than, a, fixed, speed, system, in, hot, weather, air, conditioning, can, prevent, heat, stroke, dehydration, from, excessive, perspiration, fluid, and, electrolyte, disorders, kidney, failure, in, addition, to, other, problems, related, to, hyperthermia, heat, waves, are, the, most, lethal, type, of, weather, phenomenon, in, the, united, states, a, 2020, study, found, that, areas, with, lower, use, of, air, conditioning, correlated, with, higher, rates, of, heat, related, mortality, and, hospitalizations, the, august, 2003, france, heatwave, resulted, in, approximately, 15, 000, deaths, where, 80, of, the, victims, were, over, 75, years, old, in, response, the, french, government, required, all, retirement, homes, to, have, at, least, one, air, conditioned, room, at, 25, c, 77, f, per, floor, during, heatwaves, air, conditioning, including, filtration, humidification, cooling, and, disinfection, can, be, used, to, provide, a, clean, safe, hypoallergenic, atmosphere, in, hospital, operating, rooms, and, other, environments, where, proper, atmosphere, is, critical, to, patient, safety, and, well, being, it, is, sometimes, recommended, for, home, use, by, people, with, allergies, especially, mold, however, poorly, maintained, water, cooling, towers, can, promote, the, growth, and, spread, of, microorganisms, such, as, legionella, pneumophila, the, infectious, agent, responsible, for, legionnaires, disease, as, long, as, the, cooling, tower, is, kept, clean, usually, by, means, of, a, chlorine, treatment, these, health, hazards, can, be, avoided, or, reduced, the, state, of, new, york, has, codified, requirements, for, registration, maintenance, and, testing, of, cooling, towers, to, protect, against, legionella, first, designed, to, benefit, targeted, industries, such, as, the, press, as, well, as, large, factories, the, invention, quickly, spread, to, public, agencies, and, administrations, with, studies, with, claims, of, increased, productivity, close, to, 24, in, places, equipped, with, air, conditioning, air, conditioning, caused, various, shifts, in, demography, notably, that, of, the, united, states, starting, from, the, 1970s, in, the, us, the, birth, rate, was, lower, in, the, spring, than, during, other, seasons, until, the, 1970s, but, this, difference, then, declined, since, then, as, of, 2007, the, sun, belt, contained, 30, of, the, total, us, population, while, it, was, inhabited, by, 24, of, americans, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, moreover, the, summer, mortality, rate, in, the, us, which, had, been, higher, in, regions, subject, to, a, heat, wave, during, the, summer, also, evened, out, the, spread, of, the, use, of, air, conditioning, acts, as, a, main, driver, for, the, growth, of, global, demand, of, electricity, according, to, a, 2018, report, from, the, international, energy, agency, iea, it, was, revealed, that, the, energy, consumption, for, cooling, in, the, united, states, involving, 328, million, americans, surpasses, the, combined, energy, consumption, of, 4, 4, billion, people, in, africa, latin, america, the, middle, east, and, asia, excluding, china, a, 2020, survey, found, that, an, estimated, 88, of, all, us, households, use, ac, increasing, to, 93, when, solely, looking, at, homes, built, between, 2010, and, 2020, space, cooling, including, air, conditioning, accounted, globally, for, 2021, terawatt, hours, of, energy, usage, in, 2016, with, around, 99, in, the, form, of, electricity, according, to, a, 2018, report, on, air, conditioning, efficiency, by, the, international, energy, agency, the, report, predicts, an, increase, of, electricity, usage, due, to, space, cooling, to, around, 6200, twh, by, 2050, and, that, with, the, progress, currently, seen, greenhouse, gas, emissions, attributable, to, space, cooling, will, double, 1, 135, million, tons, 2016, to, 2, 070, million, tons, there, is, some, push, to, increase, the, energy, efficiency, of, air, conditioners, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, and, the, iea, found, that, if, air, conditioners, could, be, twice, as, effective, as, now, 460, billion, tons, of, ghg, could, be, cut, over, 40, years, the, unep, and, iea, also, recommended, legislation, to, decrease, the, use, of, hydrofluorocarbons, better, building, insulation, and, more, sustainable, temperature, controlled, food, supply, chains, going, forward, refrigerants, have, also, caused, and, continue, to, cause, serious, environmental, issues, including, ozone, depletion, and, climate, change, as, several, countries, have, not, yet, ratified, the, kigali, amendment, to, reduce, the, consumption, and, production, of, hydrofluorocarbons, cfcs, and, hcfcs, refrigerants, such, as, r, 12, and, r, 22, respectively, used, within, air, conditioners, have, caused, damage, to, the, ozone, layer, and, hydrofluorocarbon, refrigerants, such, as, r, 410a, and, r, 404a, which, were, designed, to, replace, cfcs, and, hcfcs, are, instead, exacerbating, climate, change, both, issues, happen, due, to, the, venting, of, refrigerant, to, the, atmosphere, such, as, during, repairs, hfo, refrigerants, used, in, some, if, not, most, new, equipment, solve, both, issues, with, an, ozone, damage, potential, odp, of, zero, and, a, much, lower, global, warming, potential, gwp, in, the, single, or, double, digits, vs, the, three, or, four, digits, of, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, would, have, raised, global, temperatures, by, around, 0, 3, 0, 5, c, 0, 5, 0, 9, f, by, 2100, without, the, kigali, amendment, with, the, kigali, amendment, the, increase, of, global, temperatures, by, 2100, due, to, hydrofluorocarbons, is, predicted, to, be, around, 0, 06, c, 0, 1, f, alternatives, to, continual, air, conditioning, include, passive, cooling, passive, solar, cooling, natural, ventilation, operating, shades, to, reduce, solar, gain, using, trees, architectural, shades, windows, and, using, window, coatings, to, reduce, solar, gain, socioeconomic, groups, with, a, household, income, below, around, 10, 000, tend, to, have, a, low, air, conditioning, adoption, which, worsens, heat, related, mortality, the, lack, of, cooling, can, be, hazardous, as, areas, with, lower, use, of, air, conditioning, correlate, with, higher, rates, of, heat, related, mortality, and, hospitalizations, premature, mortality, in, nyc, is, projected, to, grow, between, 47, and, 95, in, 30, years, with, lower, income, and, vulnerable, populations, most, at, risk, studies, on, the, correlation, between, heat, related, mortality, and, hospitalizations, and, living, in, low, socioeconomic, locations, can, be, traced, in, phoenix, arizona, hong, kong, china, japan, and, italy, additionally, costs, concerning, health, care, can, act, as, another, barrier, as, the, lack, of, private, health, insurance, during, a, 2009, heat, wave, in, australia, was, associated, with, heat, related, hospitalization, disparities, in, socioeconomic, status, and, access, to, air, conditioning, are, connected, by, some, to, institutionalized, racism, which, leads, to, the, association, of, specific, marginalized, communities, with, lower, economic, status, poorer, health, residing, in, hotter, neighborhoods, engaging, in, physically, demanding, labor, and, experiencing, limited, access, to, cooling, technologies, such, as, air, conditioning, a, study, overlooking, chicago, illinois, detroit, and, michigan, found, that, black, households, were, half, as, likely, to, have, central, air, conditioning, units, when, compared, to, their, white, counterparts, especially, in, cities, redlining, creates, heat, islands, increasing, temperatures, in, certain, parts, of, the, city, this, is, due, to, materials, heat, absorbing, building, materials, and, pavements, and, lack, of, vegetation, and, shade, coverage, there, have, been, initiatives, that, provide, cooling, solutions, to, low, income, communities, such, as, public, cooling, spaces, buildings, designed, with, passive, air, conditioning, are, generally, less, expensive, to, construct, and, maintain, than, buildings, with, conventional, hvac, systems, with, lower, energy, demands, while, tens, of, air, changes, per, hour, and, cooling, of, tens, of, degrees, can, be, achieved, with, passive, methods, site, specific, microclimate, must, be, taken, into, account, complicating, building, design, many, techniques, can, be, used, to, increase, comfort, and, reduce, the, temperature, in, buildings, these, include, evaporative, cooling, selective, shading, wind, thermal, convection, and, heat, storage, passive, ventilation, is, the, process, of, supplying, air, to, and, removing, air, from, an, indoor, space, without, using, mechanical, systems, it, refers, to, the, flow, of, external, air, to, an, indoor, space, as, a, result, of, pressure, differences, arising, from, natural, forces, there, are, two, types, of, natural, ventilation, occurring, in, buildings, wind, driven, ventilation, and, buoyancy, driven, ventilation, wind, driven, ventilation, arises, from, the, different, pressures, created, by, wind, around, a, building, or, structure, and, openings, being, formed, on, the, perimeter, which, then, permit, flow, through, the, building, buoyancy, driven, ventilation, occurs, as, a, result, of, the, directional, buoyancy, force, that, results, from, temperature, differences, between, the, interior, and, exterior, passive, cooling, is, a, building, design, approach, that, focuses, on, heat, gain, control, and, heat, dissipation, in, a, building, in, order, to, improve, the, indoor, thermal, comfort, with, low, or, no, energy, consumption, this, approach, works, either, by, preventing, heat, from, entering, the, interior, heat, gain, prevention, or, by, removing, heat, from, the, building, natural, cooling, natural, cooling, utilizes, on, site, energy, available, from, the, natural, environment, combined, with, the, architectural, design, of, building, components, e, g, building, envelope, rather, than, mechanical, systems, to, dissipate, heat, therefore, natural, cooling, depends, not, only, on, the, architectural, design, of, the, building, but, on, how, the, site, s, natural, resources, are, used, as, heat, sinks, i, e, everything, that, absorbs, or, dissipates, heat, examples, of, on, site, heat, sinks, are, the, upper, atmosphere, night, sky, the, outdoor, air, wind, and, the, earth, soil, passive, daytime, radiative, cooling, pdrc, surfaces, reflect, incoming, solar, radiation, and, heat, back, into, outer, space, through, the, infrared, window, for, cooling, during, the, daytime, daytime, radiative, cooling, became, possible, with, the, ability, to, suppress, solar, heating, using, photonic, structures, which, emerged, through, a, study, by, raman, et, al, 2014, pdrcs, can, come, in, a, variety, of, forms, including, paint, coatings, and, films, that, are, designed, to, be, high, in, solar, reflectance, and, thermal, emittance, pdrc, applications, on, building, roofs, and, envelopes, have, demonstrated, significant, decreases, in, energy, consumption, and, costs, in, suburban, single, family, residential, areas, pdrc, application, on, roofs, can, potentially, lower, energy, costs, by, 26, to, 46, pdrcs, are, predicted, to, show, a, market, size, of, 27, billion, for, indoor, space, cooling, by, 2025, and, have, undergone, a, surge, in, research, and, development, since, the, 2010s, hand, fans, have, existed, since, prehistory, large, human, powered, fans, built, into, buildings, include, the, punkah, the, 2nd, century, chinese, inventor, ding, huan, of, the, han, dynasty, invented, a, rotary, fan, for, air, conditioning, with, seven, wheels, 3, m, 10, ft, in, diameter, and, manually, powered, by, prisoners, 99, 151, 233, in, 747, emperor, xuanzong, r, 712, 762, of, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, had, the, cool, hall, liang, dian, built, in, the, imperial, palace, which, the, tang, yulin, describes, as, having, water, powered, fan, wheels, for, air, conditioning, as, well, as, rising, jet, streams, of, water, from, fountains, during, the, subsequent, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, written, sources, mentioned, the, air, conditioning, rotary, fan, as, even, more, widely, used, 134, 151, in, areas, that, are, cold, at, night, or, in, winter, heat, storage, is, used, heat, may, be, stored, in, earth, or, masonry, air, is, drawn, past, the, masonry, to, heat, or, cool, it, in, areas, that, are, below, freezing, at, night, in, winter, snow, and, ice, can, be, collected, and, stored, in, ice, houses, for, later, use, in, cooling, this, technique, is, over, 3, 700, years, old, in, the, middle, east, harvesting, outdoor, ice, during, winter, and, transporting, and, storing, for, use, in, summer, was, practiced, by, wealthy, europeans, in, the, early, 1600s, and, became, popular, in, europe, and, the, americas, towards, the, end, of, the, 1600s, this, practice, was, replaced, by, mechanical, compression, cycle, icemakers, in, dry, hot, climates, the, evaporative, cooling, effect, may, be, used, by, placing, water, at, the, air, intake, such, that, the, draft, draws, air, over, water, and, then, into, the, house, for, this, reason, it, is, sometimes, said, that, the, fountain, in, the, architecture, of, hot, arid, climates, is, like, the, fireplace, in, the, architecture, of, cold, climates, evaporative, cooling, also, makes, the, air, more, humid, which, can, be, beneficial, in, a, dry, desert, climate, evaporative, coolers, tend, to, feel, as, if, they, are, not, working, during, times, of, high, humidity, when, there, is, not, much, dry, air, with, which, the, coolers, can, work, to, make, the, air, as, cool, as, possible, for, dwelling, occupants, unlike, other, types, of, air, conditioners, evaporative, coolers, rely, on, the, outside, air, to, be, channeled, through, cooler, pads, that, cool, the, air, before, it, reaches, the, inside, of, a, house, through, its, air, duct, system, this, cooled, outside, air, must, be, allowed, to, push, the, warmer, air, within, the, house, out, through, an, exhaust, opening, such, as, an, open, door, or, window
