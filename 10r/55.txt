computer, hardware, includes, the, physical, parts, of, a, computer, such, as, the, central, processing, unit, cpu, random, access, memory, ram, motherboard, computer, data, storage, graphics, card, sound, card, and, computer, case, it, includes, external, devices, such, as, a, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and, speakers, by, contrast, software, is, the, set, of, instructions, that, can, be, stored, and, run, by, hardware, hardware, is, so, termed, because, it, is, hard, or, rigid, with, respect, to, changes, whereas, software, is, soft, because, it, is, easy, to, change, hardware, is, typically, directed, by, the, software, to, execute, any, command, or, instruction, a, combination, of, hardware, and, software, forms, a, usable, computing, system, although, other, systems, exist, with, only, hardware, early, computing, devices, more, complicated, than, the, ancient, abacus, date, to, the, seventeenth, century, french, mathematician, blaise, pascal, designed, a, gear, based, device, that, could, add, and, subtract, selling, around, 50, models, the, stepped, reckoner, was, invented, by, gottfried, leibniz, by, 1676, which, could, also, divide, and, multiply, due, to, the, limitations, of, contemporary, fabrication, and, design, flaws, leibniz, reckoner, was, not, very, functional, but, similar, devices, leibniz, wheel, remained, in, use, into, the, 1970s, in, the, 19th, century, englishman, charles, babbage, invented, the, difference, engine, a, mechanical, device, to, calculate, polynomials, for, astronomical, purposes, babbage, also, designed, a, general, purpose, computer, that, was, never, built, much, of, the, design, was, incorporated, into, the, earliest, computers, punch, cards, for, input, and, output, memory, an, arithmetic, unit, analogous, to, central, processing, units, and, even, a, primitive, programming, language, similar, to, assembly, language, in, 1936, alan, turing, developed, the, universal, turing, machine, to, model, any, type, of, computer, proving, that, no, computer, would, be, able, to, solve, the, decision, problem, the, universal, turing, machine, was, a, type, of, stored, program, computer, capable, of, mimicking, the, operations, of, any, turing, machine, computer, model, based, on, the, software, instructions, passed, to, it, the, storage, of, computer, programs, is, key, to, the, operation, of, modern, computers, and, is, the, connection, between, computer, hardware, and, software, even, prior, to, this, in, the, mid, 19th, century, mathematician, george, boole, invented, boolean, algebra, a, system, of, logic, where, each, proposition, is, either, true, or, false, boolean, algebra, is, now, the, basis, of, the, circuits, that, model, the, transistors, and, other, components, of, integrated, circuits, that, make, up, modern, computer, hardware, in, 1945, turing, finished, the, design, for, a, computer, the, automatic, computing, engine, that, was, never, built, around, this, time, technological, advancement, in, relays, and, vacuum, tubes, enabled, the, construction, of, the, first, computers, building, on, babbage, s, design, relay, computers, were, built, by, george, stibitz, at, bell, laboratories, and, harvard, university, s, howard, aiken, who, engineered, the, mark, i, also, in, 1945, mathematician, john, von, neumann, working, on, the, eniac, project, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, devised, the, underlying, von, neumann, architecture, that, has, served, as, the, template, for, most, modern, computers, von, neumann, s, design, featured, a, centralized, memory, that, stored, both, data, and, programs, a, central, processing, unit, cpu, with, priority, of, access, to, the, memory, and, input, and, output, i, o, units, von, neumann, used, a, single, bus, to, transfer, data, meaning, that, his, solution, to, the, storage, problem, by, locating, programs, and, data, adjacent, to, each, other, created, the, von, neumann, bottleneck, when, the, system, tries, to, fetch, both, at, the, same, time, often, throttling, the, system, s, performance, computer, architecture, requires, prioritizing, between, different, goals, such, as, cost, speed, availability, and, energy, efficiency, the, designer, must, have, a, good, grasp, of, the, hardware, requirements, and, many, different, aspects, of, computing, from, compilers, to, integrated, circuit, design, cost, has, also, become, a, significant, constraint, for, manufacturers, seeking, to, sell, their, products, for, less, money, than, competitors, offering, a, very, similar, commodity, profit, margins, have, also, been, reduced, even, when, the, performance, is, not, increasing, the, cost, of, components, has, been, dropping, over, time, due, to, improved, manufacturing, techniques, that, have, fewer, components, rejected, at, quality, assurance, stage, the, most, common, instruction, set, architecture, isa, the, interface, between, a, computer, s, hardware, and, software, is, based, on, the, one, devised, by, von, neumann, in, 1945, despite, the, separation, of, the, computing, unit, and, the, i, o, system, in, many, diagrams, typically, the, hardware, is, shared, with, a, bit, in, the, computing, unit, indicating, whether, it, is, in, computation, or, i, o, mode, common, types, of, isas, include, cisc, complex, instruction, set, computer, risc, reduced, instruction, set, computer, vector, operations, and, hybrid, modes, cisc, involves, using, a, larger, expression, set, to, minimize, the, number, of, instructions, the, machines, need, to, use, based, on, a, recognition, that, only, a, few, instructions, are, commonly, used, risc, shrinks, the, instruction, set, for, added, simplicity, which, also, enables, the, inclusion, of, more, registers, after, the, invention, of, risc, in, the, 1980s, risc, based, architectures, that, used, pipelining, and, caching, to, increase, performance, displaced, cisc, architectures, particularly, in, applications, with, restrictions, on, power, usage, or, space, such, as, mobile, phones, from, 1986, to, 2003, the, annual, rate, of, improvement, in, hardware, performance, exceeded, 50, percent, enabling, the, development, of, new, computing, devices, such, as, tablets, and, mobiles, alongside, the, density, of, transistors, dram, memory, as, well, as, flash, and, magnetic, disk, storage, also, became, exponentially, more, compact, and, cheaper, the, rate, of, improvement, slackened, off, in, the, twenty, first, century, in, the, twenty, first, century, increases, in, performance, have, been, driven, by, increasing, exploitation, of, parallelism, applications, are, often, parallelizable, in, two, ways, either, the, same, function, is, running, across, multiple, areas, of, data, data, parallelism, or, different, tasks, can, be, performed, simultaneously, with, limited, interaction, task, parallelism, these, forms, of, parallelism, are, accommodated, by, various, hardware, strategies, including, instruction, level, parallelism, such, as, instruction, pipelining, vector, architectures, and, graphical, processing, units, gpus, that, are, able, to, implement, data, parallelism, thread, level, parallelism, and, request, level, parallelism, both, implementing, task, level, parallelism, microarchitecture, also, known, as, computer, organization, refers, to, high, level, hardware, questions, such, as, the, design, of, the, cpu, memory, and, memory, interconnect, memory, hierarchy, ensures, that, the, memory, quicker, to, access, and, more, expensive, is, located, closer, to, the, cpu, while, slower, cheaper, memory, for, large, volume, storage, is, located, further, away, memory, is, typically, segregated, to, separate, programs, from, data, and, limit, an, attacker, s, ability, to, alter, programs, most, computers, use, virtual, memory, to, simplify, addressing, for, programs, using, the, operating, system, to, map, virtual, memory, to, different, areas, of, the, finite, physical, memory, computer, processors, generate, heat, and, excessive, heat, impacts, their, performance, and, can, harm, the, components, many, computer, chips, will, automatically, throttle, their, performance, to, avoid, overheating, computers, also, typically, have, mechanisms, for, dissipating, excessive, heat, such, as, air, or, liquid, coolers, for, the, cpu, and, gpu, and, heatsinks, for, other, components, such, as, the, ram, computer, cases, are, also, often, ventilated, to, help, dissipate, heat, from, the, computer, data, centers, typically, use, more, sophisticated, cooling, solutions, to, keep, the, operating, temperature, of, the, entire, center, safe, air, cooled, systems, are, more, common, in, smaller, or, older, data, centers, while, liquid, cooled, immersion, where, each, computer, is, surrounded, by, cooling, fluid, and, direct, to, chip, where, the, cooling, fluid, is, directed, to, each, computer, chip, can, be, more, expensive, but, are, also, more, efficient, most, computers, are, designed, to, be, more, powerful, than, their, cooling, system, but, their, sustained, operations, cannot, exceed, the, capacity, of, the, cooling, system, while, performance, can, be, temporarily, increased, when, the, computer, is, not, hot, overclocking, in, order, to, protect, the, hardware, from, excessive, heat, the, system, will, automatically, reduce, performance, or, shut, down, the, processor, if, necessary, processors, also, will, shut, off, or, enter, a, low, power, mode, when, inactive, to, reduce, heat, power, delivery, as, well, as, heat, dissipation, are, the, most, challenging, aspects, of, hardware, design, and, have, been, the, limiting, factor, to, the, development, of, smaller, and, faster, chips, since, the, early, twenty, first, century, increases, in, performance, require, a, commensurate, increase, in, energy, use, and, cooling, demand, the, personal, computer, is, one, of, the, most, common, types, of, computer, due, to, its, versatility, and, relatively, low, price, virtual, hardware, is, software, that, mimics, the, function, of, hardware, it, is, commonly, used, in, infrastructure, as, a, service, iaas, and, platform, as, a, service, paas, embedded, systems, have, the, most, variation, in, their, processing, power, and, cost, from, an, 8, bit, processor, that, could, cost, less, than, usd, 0, 10, to, higher, end, processors, capable, of, billions, of, operations, per, second, and, costing, over, usd, 100, cost, is, a, particular, concern, with, these, systems, with, designers, often, choosing, the, cheapest, option, that, satisfies, the, performance, requirements, a, computer, case, encloses, most, of, the, components, of, a, desktop, computer, system, it, provides, mechanical, support, and, protection, for, internal, elements, such, as, the, motherboard, disk, drives, and, power, supply, and, controls, and, directs, the, flow, of, cooling, air, over, internal, components, the, case, is, also, part, of, the, system, to, control, electromagnetic, interference, radiated, by, the, computer, and, protects, internal, parts, from, electrostatic, discharge, large, tower, cases, provide, space, for, multiple, disk, drives, or, other, peripherals, and, usually, stand, on, the, floor, while, desktop, cases, provide, less, expansion, room, all, in, one, style, designs, include, a, video, display, built, into, the, same, case, portable, and, laptop, computers, require, cases, that, provide, impact, protection, for, the, unit, hobbyists, may, decorate, the, cases, with, colored, lights, paint, or, other, features, in, an, activity, called, case, modding, most, personal, computer, power, supply, units, meet, the, atx, standard, and, convert, from, alternating, current, ac, at, between, 120, and, 277, volts, provided, from, a, power, outlet, to, direct, current, dc, at, a, much, lower, voltage, typically, 12, 5, or, 3, 3, volts, the, motherboard, is, the, main, component, of, a, computer, it, is, a, board, with, integrated, circuitry, that, connects, the, other, parts, of, the, computer, including, the, cpu, the, ram, the, disk, drives, cd, dvd, hard, disk, or, any, others, as, well, as, any, peripherals, connected, via, the, ports, or, the, expansion, slots, the, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, in, a, computer, typically, contain, billions, of, tiny, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistors, mosfets, components, directly, attached, to, or, to, part, of, the, motherboard, include, an, expansion, card, in, computing, is, a, printed, circuit, board, that, can, be, inserted, into, an, expansion, slot, of, a, computer, motherboard, or, backplane, to, add, functionality, to, a, computer, system, via, the, expansion, bus, expansion, cards, can, be, used, to, obtain, or, expand, on, features, not, offered, by, the, motherboard, using, expansion, cards, for, a, video, processor, used, to, be, common, but, modern, computers, are, more, likely, to, instead, have, a, gpu, integrated, into, the, motherboard, most, computers, also, have, an, external, data, bus, to, connect, peripheral, devices, to, the, motherboard, most, commonly, universal, serial, bus, usb, is, used, unlike, the, internal, bus, the, external, bus, is, connected, using, a, bus, controller, that, allows, the, peripheral, system, to, operate, at, a, different, speed, from, the, cpu, input, and, output, devices, are, used, to, receive, data, from, the, external, world, or, write, data, respectively, common, examples, include, keyboards, and, mice, input, and, displays, and, printers, output, network, interface, controllers, are, used, to, access, the, internet, usb, ports, also, allow, power, to, connected, devices, a, standard, usb, supplies, power, at, 5, volts, and, up, to, 500, milliamps, 2, 5, watts, while, powered, usb, ports, with, additional, pins, may, allow, the, delivery, of, more, power, up, to, 6, amps, at, 24v, global, revenue, from, computer, hardware, in, 2023, reached, 705, 17, billion, because, computer, parts, contain, hazardous, materials, there, is, a, growing, movement, to, recycle, old, and, outdated, parts, computer, hardware, contain, dangerous, chemicals, such, as, lead, mercury, nickel, and, cadmium, according, to, the, epa, these, e, wastes, have, a, harmful, effect, on, the, environment, unless, they, are, disposed, of, properly, making, hardware, requires, energy, and, recycling, parts, will, reduce, air, pollution, water, pollution, as, well, as, greenhouse, gas, emissions, disposing, unauthorized, computer, equipment, is, in, fact, illegal, legislation, makes, it, mandatory, to, recycle, computers, through, the, government, approved, facilities, recycling, a, computer, can, be, made, easier, by, taking, out, certain, reusable, parts, for, example, the, ram, dvd, drive, the, graphics, card, hard, drive, or, ssd, and, other, similar, removable, parts, can, be, reused, many, materials, used, in, computer, hardware, can, be, recovered, by, recycling, for, use, in, future, production, reuse, of, tin, silicon, iron, aluminum, and, a, variety, of, plastics, that, are, present, in, bulk, in, computers, or, other, electronics, can, reduce, the, costs, of, constructing, new, systems, components, frequently, contain, copper, gold, tantalum, silver, platinum, palladium, and, lead, as, well, as, other, valuable, materials, suitable, for, reclamation, the, central, processing, unit, contains,
