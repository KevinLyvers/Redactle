a, catapult, is, a, ballistic, device, used, to, launch, a, projectile, a, great, distance, without, the, aid, of, gunpowder, or, other, propellants, particularly, various, types, of, ancient, and, medieval, siege, engines, a, catapult, uses, the, sudden, release, of, stored, potential, energy, to, propel, its, payload, most, convert, tension, or, torsion, energy, that, was, more, slowly, and, manually, built, up, within, the, device, before, release, via, springs, bows, twisted, rope, elastic, or, any, of, numerous, other, materials, and, mechanisms, in, use, since, ancient, times, the, catapult, has, proven, to, be, one, of, the, most, persistently, effective, mechanisms, in, warfare, in, modern, times, the, term, can, apply, to, devices, ranging, from, a, simple, hand, held, implement, also, called, a, slingshot, to, a, mechanism, for, launching, aircraft, from, a, ship, the, earliest, catapults, date, to, at, least, the, 7th, century, bc, with, king, uzziah, of, judah, recorded, as, equipping, the, walls, of, jerusalem, with, machines, that, shot, great, stones, catapults, are, mentioned, in, yajurveda, under, the, name, jyah, in, chapter, 30, verse, 7, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, mangonel, appeared, in, ancient, china, a, type, of, traction, trebuchet, and, catapult, early, uses, were, also, attributed, to, ajatashatru, of, magadha, in, his, 5th, century, bc, war, against, the, licchavis, greek, catapults, were, invented, in, the, early, 4th, century, bc, being, attested, by, diodorus, siculus, as, part, of, the, equipment, of, a, greek, army, in, 399, bc, and, subsequently, used, at, the, siege, of, motya, in, 397, bc, the, word, catapult, comes, from, the, latin, catapulta, which, in, turn, comes, from, the, greek, ancient, greek, katapelt, s, itself, from, kata, downwards, and, pall, to, toss, to, hurl, catapults, were, invented, by, the, ancient, greeks, and, in, ancient, india, where, they, were, used, by, the, magadhan, emperor, ajatashatru, around, the, early, to, mid, 5th, century, bc, the, catapult, and, crossbow, in, greece, are, closely, intertwined, primitive, catapults, were, essentially, the, product, of, relatively, straightforward, attempts, to, increase, the, range, and, penetrating, power, of, missiles, by, strengthening, the, bow, which, propelled, them, the, historian, diodorus, siculus, fl, 1st, century, bc, described, the, invention, of, a, mechanical, arrow, firing, catapult, katapeltikon, by, a, greek, task, force, in, 399, bc, the, weapon, was, soon, after, employed, against, motya, 397, bc, a, key, carthaginian, stronghold, in, sicily, diodorus, is, assumed, to, have, drawn, his, description, from, the, highly, rated, history, of, philistus, a, contemporary, of, the, events, then, the, introduction, of, crossbows, however, can, be, dated, further, back, according, to, the, inventor, hero, of, alexandria, fl, 1st, century, ad, who, referred, to, the, now, lost, works, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, engineer, ctesibius, this, weapon, was, inspired, by, an, earlier, foot, held, crossbow, called, the, gastraphetes, which, could, store, more, energy, than, the, greek, bows, a, detailed, description, of, the, gastraphetes, or, the, belly, bow, along, with, a, watercolor, drawing, is, found, in, heron, s, technical, treatise, belopoeica, a, third, greek, author, biton, fl, 2nd, century, bc, whose, reliability, has, been, positively, reevaluated, by, recent, scholarship, described, two, advanced, forms, of, the, gastraphetes, which, he, credits, to, zopyros, an, engineer, from, southern, italy, zopyrus, has, been, plausibly, equated, with, a, pythagorean, of, that, name, who, seems, to, have, flourished, in, the, late, 5th, century, bc, he, probably, designed, his, bow, machines, on, the, occasion, of, the, sieges, of, cumae, and, milet, between, 421, bc, and, 401, bc, the, bows, of, these, machines, already, featured, a, winched, pull, back, system, and, could, apparently, throw, two, missiles, at, once, philo, of, byzantium, provides, probably, the, most, detailed, account, on, the, establishment, of, a, theory, of, belopoietics, belos, projectile, poietike, art, of, making, circa, 200, bc, the, central, principle, to, this, theory, was, that, all, parts, of, a, catapult, including, the, weight, or, length, of, the, projectile, were, proportional, to, the, size, of, the, torsion, springs, this, kind, of, innovation, is, indicative, of, the, increasing, rate, at, which, geometry, and, physics, were, being, assimilated, into, military, enterprises, from, the, mid, 4th, century, bc, onwards, evidence, of, the, greek, use, of, arrow, shooting, machines, becomes, more, dense, and, varied, arrow, firing, machines, katapaltai, are, briefly, mentioned, by, aeneas, tacticus, in, his, treatise, on, siegecraft, written, around, 350, bc, an, extant, inscription, from, the, athenian, arsenal, dated, between, 338, and, 326, bc, lists, a, number, of, stored, catapults, with, shooting, bolts, of, varying, size, and, springs, of, sinews, the, later, entry, is, particularly, noteworthy, as, it, constitutes, the, first, clear, evidence, for, the, switch, to, torsion, catapults, which, are, more, powerful, than, the, more, flexible, crossbows, and, which, came, to, dominate, greek, and, roman, artillery, design, thereafter, this, move, to, torsion, springs, was, likely, spurred, by, the, engineers, of, philip, ii, of, macedonia, another, athenian, inventory, from, 330, to, 329, bc, includes, catapult, bolts, with, heads, and, flights, as, the, use, of, catapults, became, more, commonplace, so, did, the, training, required, to, operate, them, many, greek, children, were, instructed, in, catapult, usage, as, evidenced, by, a, 3rd, century, b, c, inscription, from, the, island, of, ceos, in, the, cyclades, catapult, shooting, competitions, for, the, young, arrow, firing, machines, in, action, are, reported, from, philip, ii, s, siege, of, perinth, thrace, in, 340, bc, at, the, same, time, greek, fortifications, began, to, feature, high, towers, with, shuttered, windows, in, the, top, which, could, have, been, used, to, house, anti, personnel, arrow, shooters, as, in, aigosthena, projectiles, included, both, arrows, and, later, stones, that, were, sometimes, lit, on, fire, onomarchus, of, phocis, first, used, catapults, on, the, battlefield, against, philip, ii, of, macedon, philip, s, son, alexander, the, great, was, the, next, commander, in, recorded, history, to, make, such, use, of, catapults, on, the, battlefield, as, well, as, to, use, them, during, sieges, the, romans, started, to, use, catapults, as, arms, for, their, wars, against, syracuse, macedon, sparta, and, aetolia, 3rd, and, 2nd, centuries, bc, the, roman, machine, known, as, an, arcuballista, was, similar, to, a, large, crossbow, later, the, romans, used, ballista, catapults, on, their, warships, in, chronological, order, castles, and, fortified, walled, cities, were, common, during, this, period, and, catapults, were, used, as, siege, weapons, against, them, as, well, as, their, use, in, attempts, to, breach, walls, incendiary, missiles, or, diseased, carcasses, or, garbage, could, be, catapulted, over, the, walls, defensive, techniques, in, the, middle, ages, progressed, to, a, point, that, rendered, catapults, largely, ineffective, the, viking, siege, of, paris, ad, 885, 6, saw, the, employment, by, both, sides, of, virtually, every, instrument, of, siege, craft, known, to, the, classical, world, including, a, variety, of, catapults, to, little, effect, resulting, in, failure, the, most, widely, used, catapults, throughout, the, middle, ages, were, as, follows, the, last, large, scale, military, use, of, catapults, was, during, the, trench, warfare, of, world, war, i, during, the, early, stages, of, the, war, catapults, were, used, to, throw, hand, grenades, across, no, man, s, land, into, enemy, trenches, they, were, eventually, replaced, by, small, mortars, the, spbg, silent, projector, of, bottles, and, grenades, was, a, soviet, proposal, for, an, anti, tank, weapon, that, launched, grenades, from, a, spring, loaded, shuttle, up, to, 100, m, 330, ft, special, variants, called, aircraft, catapults, are, used, to, launch, planes, from, land, bases, and, sea, carriers, when, the, takeoff, runway, is, too, short, for, a, powered, takeoff, or, simply, impractical, to, extend, ships, also, use, them, to, launch, torpedoes, and, deploy, bombs, against, submarines, in, 2024, during, the, israel, hamas, war, a, trebuchet, created, by, private, initiative, of, an, idf, reserve, unit, was, used, to, throw, firebrands, over, the, border, into, lebanon, in, order, to, set, on, fire, the, undergrowth, which, offered, camouflage, to, hezbollah, fighters, in, the, 1840s, the, invention, of, vulcanized, rubber, allowed, the, making, of, small, hand, held, catapults, either, improvised, from, y, shaped, sticks, or, manufactured, for, sale, both, were, popular, with, children, and, teenagers, these, devices, were, also, known, as, slingshots, in, the, united, states, small, catapults, referred, to, as, traps, are, still, widely, used, to, launch, clay, targets, into, the, air, in, the, sport, of, clay, pigeon, shooting, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, a, powerful, catapult, a, trebuchet, was, used, by, thrill, seekers, first, on, private, property, and, in, 2001, 2002, at, middlemoor, water, park, somerset, england, to, experience, being, catapulted, through, the, air, for, 100, feet, 30, m, the, practice, has, been, discontinued, due, to, a, fatality, at, the, water, park, there, had, been, an, injury, when, the, trebuchet, was, in, use, on, private, property, injury, and, death, occurred, when, those, two, participants, failed, to, land, onto, the, safety, net, the, operators, of, the, trebuchet, were, tried, but, found, not, guilty, of, manslaughter, though, the, jury, noted, that, the, fatality, might, have, been, avoided, had, the, operators, imposed, stricter, safety, measures, human, cannonball, circus, acts, use, a, catapult, launch, mechanism, rather, than, gunpowder, and, are, risky, ventures, for, the, human, cannonballs, early, launched, roller, coasters, used, a, catapult, system, powered, by, a, diesel, engine, or, a, dropped, weight, to, acquire, their, momentum, such, as, shuttle, loop, installations, between, 1977, and, 1978, the, catapult, system, for, roller, coasters, has, been, replaced, by, flywheels, and, later, linear, motors, pumpkin, chunking, is, another, widely, popularized, use, in, which, people, compete, to, see, who, can, launch, a, pumpkin, the, farthest, by, mechanical, means, although, the, world, record, is, held, by, a, pneumatic, air, cannon, in, january, 2011, a, homemade, catapult, was, discovered, that, was, used, to, smuggle, cannabis, into, the, united, states, from, mexico, the, machine, was, found, 20, ft, 6, 1, m, from, the, border, fence, with, 4, 4, pounds, 2, 0, kg, bales, of, cannabis, ready, to, launch
