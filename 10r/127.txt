a, semiconductor, device, is, an, electronic, component, that, relies, on, the, electronic, properties, of, a, semiconductor, material, primarily, silicon, germanium, and, gallium, arsenide, as, well, as, organic, semiconductors, for, its, function, its, conductivity, lies, between, conductors, and, insulators, semiconductor, devices, have, replaced, vacuum, tubes, in, most, applications, they, conduct, electric, current, in, the, solid, state, rather, than, as, free, electrons, across, a, vacuum, typically, liberated, by, thermionic, emission, or, as, free, electrons, and, ions, through, an, ionized, gas, semiconductor, devices, are, manufactured, both, as, single, discrete, devices, and, as, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, which, consist, of, two, or, more, devices, which, can, number, from, the, hundreds, to, the, billions, manufactured, and, interconnected, on, a, single, semiconductor, wafer, also, called, a, substrate, semiconductor, materials, are, useful, because, their, behavior, can, be, easily, manipulated, by, the, deliberate, addition, of, impurities, known, as, doping, semiconductor, conductivity, can, be, controlled, by, the, introduction, of, an, electric, or, magnetic, field, by, exposure, to, light, or, heat, or, by, the, mechanical, deformation, of, a, doped, monocrystalline, silicon, grid, thus, semiconductors, can, make, excellent, sensors, current, conduction, in, a, semiconductor, occurs, due, to, mobile, or, free, electrons, and, electron, holes, collectively, known, as, charge, carriers, doping, a, semiconductor, with, a, small, proportion, of, an, atomic, impurity, such, as, phosphorus, or, boron, greatly, increases, the, number, of, free, electrons, or, holes, within, the, semiconductor, when, a, doped, semiconductor, contains, excess, holes, it, is, called, a, p, type, semiconductor, p, for, positive, electric, charge, when, it, contains, excess, free, electrons, it, is, called, an, n, type, semiconductor, n, for, a, negative, electric, charge, a, majority, of, mobile, charge, carriers, have, negative, charges, the, manufacture, of, semiconductors, controls, precisely, the, location, and, concentration, of, p, and, n, type, dopants, the, connection, of, n, type, and, p, type, semiconductors, form, p, n, junctions, the, most, common, semiconductor, device, in, the, world, is, the, mosfet, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, also, called, the, mos, transistor, as, of, 2013, billions, of, mos, transistors, are, manufactured, every, day, semiconductor, devices, made, per, year, have, been, growing, by, 9, 1, on, average, since, 1978, and, shipments, in, 2018, are, predicted, for, the, first, time, to, exceed, 1, trillion, meaning, that, well, over, 7, trillion, have, been, made, to, date, a, semiconductor, diode, is, a, device, typically, made, from, a, single, p, n, junction, at, the, junction, of, a, p, type, and, an, n, type, semiconductor, there, forms, a, depletion, region, where, current, conduction, is, inhibited, by, the, lack, of, mobile, charge, carriers, when, the, device, is, forward, biased, connected, with, the, p, side, having, a, higher, electric, potential, than, the, n, side, this, depletion, region, is, diminished, allowing, for, significant, conduction, contrariwise, only, a, very, small, current, can, be, achieved, when, the, diode, is, reverse, biased, connected, with, the, n, side, at, lower, electric, potential, than, the, p, side, and, thus, the, depletion, region, expanded, exposing, a, semiconductor, to, light, can, generate, electron, hole, pairs, which, increases, the, number, of, free, carriers, and, thereby, the, conductivity, diodes, optimized, to, take, advantage, of, this, phenomenon, are, known, as, photodiodes, compound, semiconductor, diodes, can, also, produce, light, as, in, light, emitting, diodes, and, laser, diode, bipolar, junction, transistors, bjts, are, formed, from, two, p, n, junctions, in, either, n, p, n, or, p, n, p, configuration, the, middle, or, base, the, region, between, the, junctions, is, typically, very, narrow, the, other, regions, and, their, associated, terminals, are, known, as, the, emitter, and, the, collector, a, small, current, injected, through, the, junction, between, the, base, and, the, emitter, changes, the, properties, of, the, base, collector, junction, so, that, it, can, conduct, current, even, though, it, is, reverse, biased, this, creates, a, much, larger, current, between, the, collector, and, emitter, controlled, by, the, base, emitter, current, another, type, of, transistor, the, field, effect, transistor, fet, operates, on, the, principle, that, semiconductor, conductivity, can, be, increased, or, decreased, by, the, presence, of, an, electric, field, an, electric, field, can, increase, the, number, of, free, electrons, and, holes, in, a, semiconductor, thereby, changing, its, conductivity, the, field, may, be, applied, by, a, reverse, biased, p, n, junction, forming, a, junction, field, effect, transistor, jfet, or, by, an, electrode, insulated, from, the, bulk, material, by, an, oxide, layer, forming, a, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, fet, mosfet, or, mos, transistor, a, solid, state, device, is, by, far, the, most, used, widely, semiconductor, device, today, it, accounts, for, at, least, 99, 9, of, all, transistors, and, there, have, been, an, estimated, 13, sextillion, mosfets, manufactured, between, 1960, and, 2018, the, gate, electrode, is, charged, to, produce, an, electric, field, that, controls, the, conductivity, of, a, channel, between, two, terminals, called, the, source, and, drain, depending, on, the, type, of, carrier, in, the, channel, the, device, may, be, an, n, channel, for, electrons, or, a, p, channel, for, holes, mosfet, although, the, mosfet, is, named, in, part, for, its, metal, gate, in, modern, devices, polysilicon, is, typically, used, instead, two, terminal, devices, three, terminal, devices, four, terminal, devices, by, far, silicon, si, is, the, most, widely, used, material, in, semiconductor, devices, its, combination, of, low, raw, material, cost, relatively, simple, processing, and, a, useful, temperature, range, makes, it, currently, the, best, compromise, among, the, various, competing, materials, silicon, used, in, semiconductor, device, manufacturing, is, currently, fabricated, into, boules, that, are, large, enough, in, diameter, to, allow, the, production, of, 300, mm, 12, in, wafers, germanium, ge, was, a, widely, used, early, semiconductor, material, but, its, thermal, sensitivity, makes, it, less, useful, than, silicon, today, germanium, is, often, alloyed, with, silicon, for, use, in, very, high, speed, sige, devices, ibm, is, a, major, producer, of, such, devices, gallium, arsenide, gaas, is, also, widely, used, in, high, speed, devices, but, so, far, it, has, been, difficult, to, form, large, diameter, boules, of, this, material, limiting, the, wafer, diameter, to, sizes, significantly, smaller, than, silicon, wafers, thus, making, mass, production, of, gaas, devices, significantly, more, expensive, than, silicon, gallium, nitride, gan, is, gaining, popularity, in, high, power, applications, including, power, ics, light, emitting, diodes, leds, and, rf, components, due, to, its, high, strength, and, thermal, conductivity, compared, to, silicon, gan, s, band, gap, is, more, than, 3, times, wider, at, 3, 4, ev, and, it, conducts, electrons, 1, 000, times, more, efficiently, other, less, common, materials, are, also, in, use, or, under, investigation, silicon, carbide, sic, is, also, gaining, popularity, in, power, ics, and, has, found, some, application, as, the, raw, material, for, blue, leds, and, is, being, investigated, for, use, in, semiconductor, devices, that, could, withstand, very, high, operating, temperatures, and, environments, with, the, presence, of, significant, levels, of, ionizing, radiation, impatt, diodes, have, also, been, fabricated, from, sic, various, indium, compounds, indium, arsenide, indium, antimonide, and, indium, phosphide, are, also, being, used, in, leds, and, solid, state, laser, diodes, selenium, sulfide, is, being, studied, in, the, manufacture, of, photovoltaic, solar, cells, the, most, common, use, for, organic, semiconductors, is, organic, light, emitting, diodes, all, transistor, types, can, be, used, as, the, building, blocks, of, logic, gates, which, are, fundamental, in, the, design, of, digital, circuits, in, digital, circuits, like, microprocessors, transistors, act, as, on, off, switches, in, the, mosfet, for, instance, the, voltage, applied, to, the, gate, determines, whether, the, switch, is, on, or, off, transistors, used, for, analog, circuits, do, not, act, as, on, off, switches, rather, they, respond, to, a, continuous, range, of, inputs, with, a, continuous, range, of, outputs, common, analog, circuits, include, amplifiers, and, oscillators, circuits, that, interface, or, translate, between, digital, circuits, and, analog, circuits, are, known, as, mixed, signal, circuits, power, semiconductor, devices, are, discrete, devices, or, integrated, circuits, intended, for, high, current, or, high, voltage, applications, power, integrated, circuits, combine, ic, technology, with, power, semiconductor, technology, these, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, smart, power, devices, several, companies, specialize, in, manufacturing, power, semiconductors, the, part, numbers, of, semiconductor, devices, are, often, manufacturer, specific, nevertheless, there, have, been, attempts, at, creating, standards, for, type, codes, and, a, subset, of, devices, follow, those, for, discrete, devices, for, example, there, are, three, standards, jedec, jesd370b, in, the, united, states, pro, electron, in, europe, and, japanese, industrial, standards, jis, semiconductor, device, fabrication, is, the, process, used, to, manufacture, semiconductor, devices, typically, integrated, circuits, ics, such, as, computer, processors, microcontrollers, and, memory, chips, such, as, nand, flash, and, dram, it, is, a, multiple, step, photolithographic, and, physico, chemical, process, with, steps, such, as, thermal, oxidation, thin, film, deposition, ion, implantation, etching, during, which, electronic, circuits, are, gradually, created, on, a, wafer, typically, made, of, pure, single, crystal, semiconducting, material, silicon, is, almost, always, used, but, various, compound, semiconductors, are, used, for, specialized, applications, the, fabrication, process, is, performed, in, highly, specialized, semiconductor, fabrication, plants, also, called, foundries, or, fabs, with, the, central, part, being, the, clean, room, in, more, advanced, semiconductor, devices, such, as, modern, 14, 10, 7, nm, nodes, fabrication, can, take, up, to, 15, weeks, with, 11, 13, weeks, being, the, industry, average, production, in, advanced, fabrication, facilities, is, completely, automated, with, automated, material, handling, systems, taking, care, of, the, transport, of, wafers, from, machine, to, machine, a, wafer, often, has, several, integrated, circuits, which, are, called, dies, as, they, are, pieces, diced, from, a, single, wafer, individual, dies, are, separated, from, a, finished, wafer, in, a, process, called, die, singulation, also, called, wafer, dicing, the, dies, can, then, undergo, further, assembly, and, packaging, within, fabrication, plants, the, wafers, are, transported, inside, special, sealed, plastic, boxes, called, foups, foups, in, many, fabs, contain, an, internal, nitrogen, atmosphere, which, helps, prevent, copper, from, oxidizing, on, the, wafers, copper, is, used, in, modern, semiconductors, for, wiring, the, insides, of, the, processing, equipment, and, foups, is, kept, cleaner, than, the, surrounding, air, in, the, cleanroom, this, internal, atmosphere, is, known, as, a, mini, environment, and, helps, improve, yield, which, is, the, amount, of, working, devices, on, a, wafer, this, mini, environment, is, within, an, efem, equipment, front, end, module, which, allows, a, machine, to, receive, foups, and, introduces, wafers, from, the, foups, into, the, machine, additionally, many, machines, also, handle, wafers, in, clean, nitrogen, or, vacuum, environments, to, reduce, contamination, and, improve, process, control, fabrication, plants, need, large, amounts, of, liquid, nitrogen, to, maintain, the, atmosphere, inside, production, machinery, and, foups, which, are, constantly, purged, with, nitrogen, there, can, also, be, an, air, curtain, or, a, mesh, between, the, foup, and, the, efem, which, helps, reduce, the, amount, of, humidity, that, enters, the, foup, and, improves, yield, semiconductors, had, been, used, in, the, electronics, field, for, some, time, before, the, invention, of, the, transistor, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, they, were, quite, common, as, detectors, in, radios, used, in, a, device, called, a, cat, s, whisker, developed, by, jagadish, chandra, bose, and, others, these, detectors, were, somewhat, troublesome, however, requiring, the, operator, to, move, a, small, tungsten, filament, the, whisker, around, the, surface, of, a, galena, lead, sulfide, or, carborundum, silicon, carbide, crystal, until, it, suddenly, started, working, then, over, a, period, of, a, few, hours, or, days, the, cat, s, whisker, would, slowly, stop, working, and, the, process, would, have, to, be, repeated, at, the, time, their, operation, was, completely, mysterious, after, the, introduction, of, the, more, reliable, and, amplified, vacuum, tube, based, radios, the, cat, s, whisker, systems, quickly, disappeared, the, cat, s, whisker, is, a, primitive, example, of, a, special, type, of, diode, still, popular, today, called, a, schottky, diode, another, early, type, of, semiconductor, device, is, the, metal, rectifier, in, which, the, semiconductor, is, copper, oxide, or, selenium, westinghouse, electric, 1886, was, a, major, manufacturer, of, these, rectifiers, during, world, war, ii, radar, research, quickly, pushed, radar, receivers, to, operate, at, ever, higher, frequencies, about, 4000, mhz, and, the, traditional, tube, based, radio, receivers, no, longer, worked, well, the, introduction, of, the, cavity, magnetron, from, britain, to, the, united, states, in, 1940, during, the, tizard, mission, resulted, in, a, pressing, need, for, a, practical, high, frequency, amplifier, on, a, whim, russell, ohl, of, bell, laboratories, decided, to, try, a, cat, s, whisker, by, this, point, they, had, not, been, in, use, for, a, number, of, years, and, no, one, at, the, labs, had, one, after, hunting, one, down, at, a, used, radio, store, in, manhattan, he, found, that, it, worked, much, better, than, tube, based, systems, ohl, investigated, why, the, cat, s, whisker, functioned, so, well, he, spent, most, of, 1939, trying, to, grow, more, pure, versions, of, the, crystals, he, soon, found, that, with, higher, quality, crystals, their, finicky, behavior, went, away, but, so, did, their, ability, to, operate, as, a, radio, detector, one, day, he, found, one, of, his, purest, crystals, nevertheless, worked, well, and, it, had, a, clearly, visible, crack, near, the, middle, however, as, he, moved, about, the, room, trying, to, test, it, the, detector, would, mysteriously, work, and, then, stop, again, after, some, study, he, found, that, the, behavior, was, controlled, by, the, light, in, the, room, more, light, caused, more, conductance, in, the, crystal, he, invited, several, other, people, to, see, this, crystal, and, walter, brattain, immediately, realized, there, was, some, sort, of, junction, at, the, crack, further, research, cleared, up, the, remaining, mystery, the, crystal, had, cracked, because, either, side, contained, very, slightly, different, amounts, of, the, impurities, ohl, could, not, remove, about, 0, 2, one, side, of, the, crystal, had, impurities, that, added, extra, electrons, the, carriers, of, electric, current, and, made, it, a, conductor, the, other, had, impurities, that, wanted, to, bind, to, these, electrons, making, it, what, he, called, an, insulator, because, the, two, parts, of, the, crystal, were, in, contact, with, each, other, the, electrons, could, be, pushed, out, of, the, conductive, side, which, had, extra, electrons, soon, to, be, known, as, the, emitter, and, replaced, by, new, ones, being, provided, from, a, battery, for, instance, where, they, would, flow, into, the, insulating, portion, and, be, collected, by, the, whisker, filament, named, the, collector, however, when, the, voltage, was, reversed, the, electrons, being, pushed, into, the, collector, would, quickly, fill, up, the, holes, the, electron, needy, impurities, and, conduction, would, stop, almost, instantly, this, junction, of, the, two, crystals, or, parts, of, one, crystal, created, a, solid, state, diode, and, the, concept, soon, became, known, as, semiconduction, the, mechanism, of, action, when, the, diode, off, has, to, do, with, the, separation, of, charge, carriers, around, the, junction, this, is, called, a, depletion, region, armed, with, the, knowledge, of, how, these, new, diodes, worked, a, vigorous, effort, began, to, learn, how, to, build, them, on, demand, teams, at, purdue, university, bell, labs, mit, and, the, university, of, chicago, all, joined, forces, to, build, better, crystals, within, a, year, germanium, production, had, been, perfected, to, the, point, where, military, grade, diodes, were, being, used, in, most, radar, sets, after, the, war, william, shockley, decided, to, attempt, the, building, of, a, triode, like, semiconductor, device, he, secured, funding, and, lab, space, and, went, to, work, on, the, problem, with, brattain, and, john, bardeen, the, key, to, the, development, of, the, transistor, was, the, further, understanding, of, the, process, of, the, electron, mobility, in, a, semiconductor, it, was, realized, that, if, there, were, some, way, to, control, the, flow, of, the, electrons, from, the, emitter, to, the, collector, of, this, newly, discovered, diode, an, amplifier, could, be, built, for, instance, if, contacts, are, placed, on, both, sides, of, a, single, type, of, crystal, current, will, not, flow, between, them, through, the, crystal, however, if, a, third, contact, could, then, inject, electrons, or, holes, into, the, material, the, current, would, flow, actually, doing, this, appeared, to, be, very, difficult, if, the, crystal, were, of, any, reasonable, size, the, number, of, electrons, or, holes, required, to, be, injected, would, have, to, be, very, large, making, it, less, than, useful, as, an, amplifier, because, it, would, require, a, large, injection, current, to, start, with, that, said, the, whole, idea, of, the, crystal, diode, was, that, the, crystal, itself, could, provide, the, electrons, over, a, very, small, distance, the, depletion, region, the, key, appeared, to, be, to, place, the, input, and, output, contacts, very, close, together, on, the, surface, of, the, crystal, on, either, side, of, this, region, brattain, started, working, on, building, such, a, device, and, tantalizing, hints, of, amplification, continued, to, appear, as, the, team, worked, on, the, problem, sometimes, the, system, would, work, but, then, stop, working, unexpectedly, in, one, instance, a, non, working, system, started, working, when, placed, in, water, ohl, and, brattain, eventually, developed, a, new, branch, of, quantum, mechanics, which, became, known, as, surface, physics, to, account, for, the, behavior, the, electrons, in, any, one, piece, of, the, crystal, would, migrate, about, due, to, nearby, charges, electrons, in, the, emitters, or, the, holes, in, the, collectors, would, cluster, at, the, surface, of, the, crystal, where, they, could, find, their, opposite, charge, floating, around, in, the, air, or, water, yet, they, could, be, pushed, away, from, the, surface, with, the, application, of, a, small, amount, of, charge, from, any, other, location, on, the, crystal, instead, of, needing, a, large, supply, of, injected, electrons, a, very, small, number, in, the, right, place, on, the, crystal, would, accomplish, the, same, thing, their, understanding, solved, the, problem, of, needing, a, very, small, control, area, to, some, degree, instead, of, needing, two, separate, semiconductors, connected, by, a, common, but, tiny, region, a, single, larger, surface, would, serve, the, electron, emitting, and, collecting, leads, would, both, be, placed, very, close, together, on, the, top, with, the, control, lead, placed, on, the, base, of, the, crystal, when, current, flowed, through, this, base, lead, the, electrons, or, holes, would, be, pushed, out, across, the, block, of, the, semiconductor, and, collect, on, the, far, surface, as, long, as, the, emitter, and, collector, were, very, close, together, this, should, allow, enough, electrons, or, holes, between, them, to, allow, conduction, to, start, the, bell, team, made, many, attempts, to, build, such, a, system, with, various, tools, but, generally, failed, setups, where, the, contacts, were, close, enough, were, invariably, as, fragile, as, the, original, cat, s, whisker, detectors, had, been, and, would, work, briefly, if, at, all, eventually, they, had, a, practical, breakthrough, a, piece, of, gold, foil, was, glued, to, the, edge, of, a, plastic, wedge, and, then, the, foil, was, sliced, with, a, razor, at, the, tip, of, the, triangle, the, result, was, two, very, closely, spaced, contacts, of, gold, when, the, wedge, was, pushed, down, onto, the, surface, of, a, crystal, and, voltage, was, applied, to, the, other, side, on, the, base, of, the, crystal, current, started, to, flow, from, one, contact, to, the, other, as, the, base, voltage, pushed, the, electrons, away, from, the, base, towards, the, other, side, near, the, contacts, the, point, contact, transistor, had, been, invented, while, the, device, was, constructed, a, week, earlier, brattain, s, notes, describe, the, first, demonstration, to, higher, ups, at, bell, labs, on, the, afternoon, of, 23, december, 1947, often, given, as, the, birthdate, of, the, transistor, what, is, now, known, as, the, p, n, p, point, contact, germanium, transistor, operated, as, a, speech, amplifier, with, a, power, gain, of, 18, in, that, trial, john, bardeen, walter, houser, brattain, and, william, bradford, shockley, were, awarded, the, 1956, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, work, bell, telephone, laboratories, needed, a, generic, name, for, their, new, invention, semiconductor, triode, solid, triode, surface, states, triode, crystal, triode, and, iotatron, were, all, considered, but, transistor, coined, by, john, r, pierce, won, an, internal, ballot, the, rationale, for, the, name, is, described, in, the, following, extract, from, the, company, s, technical, memoranda, may, 28, 1948, calling, for, votes, transistor, this, is, an, abbreviated, combination, of, the, words, transconductance, or, transfer, and, varistor, the, device, logically, belongs, in, the, varistor, family, and, has, the, transconductance, or, transfer, impedance, of, a, device, having, gain, so, that, this, combination, is, descriptive, shockley, was, upset, about, the, device, being, credited, to, brattain, and, bardeen, who, he, felt, had, built, it, behind, his, back, to, take, the, glory, matters, became, worse, when, bell, labs, lawyers, found, that, some, of, shockley, s, own, writings, on, the, transistor, were, close, enough, to, those, of, an, earlier, 1925, patent, by, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, that, they, thought, it, best, that, his, name, be, left, off, the, patent, application, shockley, was, incensed, and, decided, to, demonstrate, who, was, the, real, brains, of, the, operation, a, few, months, later, he, invented, an, entirely, new, considerably, more, robust, bipolar, junction, transistor, type, of, transistor, with, a, layer, or, sandwich, structure, used, for, the, vast, majority, of, all, transistors, into, the, 1960s, with, the, fragility, problems, solved, the, remaining, problem, was, purity, making, germanium, of, the, required, purity, was, proving, to, be, a, serious, problem, and, limited, the, yield, of, transistors, that, actually, worked, from, a, given, batch, of, material, germanium, s, sensitivity, to, temperature, also, limited, its, usefulness, scientists, theorized, that, silicon, would, be, easier, to, fabricate, but, few, investigated, this, possibility, former, bell, labs, scientist, gordon, k, teal, was, the, first, to, develop, a, working, silicon, transistor, at, the, nascent, texas, instruments, giving, it, a, technological, edge, from, the, late, 1950s, most, transistors, were, silicon, based, within, a, few, years, transistor, based, products, most, notably, easily, portable, radios, were, appearing, on, the, market, zone, melting, a, technique, using, a, band, of, molten, material, moving, through, the, crystal, further, increased, crystal, purity, in, the, 1950s, mohamed, atalla, investigated, the, surface, properties, of, silicon, semiconductors, at, bell, labs, where, he, proposed, a, new, method, of, semiconductor, device, fabrication, coating, a, silicon, wafer, with, an, insulating, layer, of, silicon, oxide, so, that, electricity, could, reliably, penetrate, to, the, conducting, silicon, below, overcoming, the, surface, states, that, prevented, electricity, from, reaching, the, semiconducting, layer, this, is, known, as, surface, passivation, a, method, that, became, critical, to, the, semiconductor, industry, as, it, made, possible, the, mass, production, of, silicon, integrated, circuits, ics, building, on, his, surface, passivation, method, he, developed, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, process, which, he, proposed, could, be, used, to, build, the, first, working, silicon, field, effect, transistor, fet, the, led, to, the, invention, of, the, mosfet, mos, field, effect, transistor, by, mohamed, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, in, 1959, with, its, scalability, and, much, lower, power, consumption, and, higher, density, than, bipolar, junction, transistors, the, mosfet, became, the, most, common, type, of, transistor, in, computers, electronics, and, communications, technology, such, as, smartphones, the,
