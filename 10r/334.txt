a, tunnel, is, an, underground, or, undersea, passageway, it, is, dug, through, surrounding, soil, earth, or, rock, or, laid, under, water, and, is, usually, completely, enclosed, except, for, the, two, portals, common, at, each, end, though, there, may, be, access, and, ventilation, openings, at, various, points, along, the, length, a, pipeline, differs, significantly, from, a, tunnel, though, some, recent, tunnels, have, used, immersed, tube, construction, techniques, rather, than, traditional, tunnel, boring, methods, a, tunnel, may, be, for, foot, or, vehicular, road, traffic, for, rail, traffic, or, for, a, canal, the, central, portions, of, a, rapid, transit, network, are, usually, in, the, tunnel, some, tunnels, are, used, as, sewers, or, aqueducts, to, supply, water, for, consumption, or, for, hydroelectric, stations, utility, tunnels, are, used, for, routing, steam, chilled, water, electrical, power, or, telecommunication, cables, as, well, as, connecting, buildings, for, convenient, passage, of, people, and, equipment, secret, tunnels, are, built, for, military, purposes, or, by, civilians, for, smuggling, of, weapons, contraband, or, people, special, tunnels, such, as, wildlife, crossings, are, built, to, allow, wildlife, to, cross, human, made, barriers, safely, tunnels, can, be, connected, together, in, tunnel, networks, a, tunnel, is, relatively, long, and, narrow, the, length, is, often, much, greater, than, twice, the, diameter, although, similar, shorter, excavations, can, be, constructed, such, as, cross, passages, between, tunnels, the, definition, of, what, constitutes, a, tunnel, can, vary, widely, from, source, to, source, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, a, road, tunnel, is, defined, as, a, subsurface, highway, structure, enclosed, for, a, length, of, 150, metres, 490, ft, or, more, in, the, united, states, the, nfpa, definition, of, a, tunnel, is, an, underground, structure, with, a, design, length, greater, than, 23, m, 75, ft, and, a, diameter, greater, than, 1, 800, millimetres, 5, 9, ft, the, word, tunnel, comes, from, the, middle, english, tonnelle, meaning, a, net, derived, from, old, french, tonnel, a, diminutive, of, tonne, cask, the, modern, meaning, referring, to, an, underground, passageway, evolved, in, the, 16th, century, as, a, metaphor, for, a, narrow, confined, space, like, the, inside, of, a, cask, the, modern, sense, of, it, as, a, passageway, emerged, as, engineering, and, mining, practices, grew, some, of, the, earliest, tunnels, used, by, humans, were, paleoburrows, excavated, by, prehistoric, mammals, much, of, the, early, technology, of, tunneling, evolved, from, mining, and, military, engineering, the, etymology, of, the, terms, mining, for, mineral, extraction, or, for, siege, attacks, military, engineering, and, civil, engineering, reveals, these, deep, historic, connections, predecessors, of, modern, tunnels, were, adits, that, transported, water, for, irrigation, drinking, or, sewerage, the, first, qanats, are, known, from, before, 2000, bc, the, earliest, tunnel, known, to, have, been, excavated, from, both, ends, is, the, siloam, tunnel, built, in, jerusalem, by, the, kings, of, judah, around, the, 8th, century, bc, another, tunnel, excavated, from, both, ends, maybe, the, second, known, is, the, tunnel, of, eupalinos, which, is, a, tunnel, aqueduct, 1, 036, m, 3, 400, ft, long, running, through, mount, kastro, in, samos, greece, it, was, built, in, the, 6th, century, bc, to, serve, as, an, aqueduct, in, ethiopia, the, siqurto, foot, tunnel, hand, hewn, in, the, middle, ages, crosses, a, mountain, ridge, in, the, gaza, strip, the, network, of, tunnels, was, used, by, jewish, strategists, as, rock, cut, shelters, in, first, links, to, judean, resistance, against, roman, rule, in, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, during, the, 2nd, century, ad, a, major, tunnel, project, must, start, with, a, comprehensive, investigation, of, ground, conditions, by, collecting, samples, from, boreholes, and, by, other, geophysical, techniques, an, informed, choice, can, then, be, made, of, machinery, and, methods, for, excavation, and, ground, support, which, will, reduce, the, risk, of, encountering, unforeseen, ground, conditions, in, planning, the, route, the, horizontal, and, vertical, alignments, can, be, selected, to, make, use, of, the, best, ground, and, water, conditions, it, is, common, practice, to, locate, a, tunnel, deeper, than, otherwise, would, be, required, in, order, to, excavate, through, solid, rock, or, other, material, that, is, easier, to, support, during, construction, conventional, desk, and, preliminary, site, studies, may, yield, insufficient, information, to, assess, such, factors, as, the, blocky, nature, of, rocks, the, exact, location, of, fault, zones, or, the, stand, up, times, of, softer, ground, this, may, be, a, particular, concern, in, large, diameter, tunnels, to, give, more, information, a, pilot, tunnel, or, drift, tunnel, may, be, driven, ahead, of, the, main, excavation, this, smaller, tunnel, is, less, likely, to, collapse, catastrophically, should, unexpected, conditions, be, met, and, it, can, be, incorporated, into, the, final, tunnel, or, used, as, a, backup, or, emergency, escape, passage, alternatively, horizontal, boreholes, may, sometimes, be, drilled, ahead, of, the, advancing, tunnel, face, other, key, geotechnical, factors, for, water, crossings, a, tunnel, is, generally, more, costly, to, construct, than, a, bridge, however, both, navigational, and, traffic, considerations, may, limit, the, use, of, high, bridges, or, drawbridges, intersecting, with, shipping, channels, necessitating, a, tunnel, bridges, usually, require, a, larger, footprint, on, each, shore, than, tunnels, in, areas, with, expensive, real, estate, such, as, manhattan, and, urban, hong, kong, this, is, a, strong, factor, in, favor, of, a, tunnel, boston, s, big, dig, project, replaced, elevated, roadways, with, a, tunnel, system, to, increase, traffic, capacity, hide, traffic, reclaim, land, redecorate, and, reunite, the, city, with, the, waterfront, the, 1934, queensway, tunnel, under, the, river, mersey, at, liverpool, was, chosen, over, a, massively, high, bridge, for, defense, reasons, it, was, feared, that, aircraft, could, destroy, a, bridge, in, times, of, war, not, merely, impairing, road, traffic, but, blocking, the, river, to, navigation, maintenance, costs, of, a, massive, bridge, to, allow, the, world, s, largest, ships, to, navigate, under, were, considered, higher, than, for, a, tunnel, similar, conclusions, were, reached, for, the, 1971, kingsway, tunnel, under, the, mersey, in, hampton, roads, virginia, tunnels, were, chosen, over, bridges, for, strategic, considerations, in, the, event, of, damage, bridges, might, prevent, us, navy, vessels, from, leaving, naval, station, norfolk, water, crossing, tunnels, built, instead, of, bridges, include, the, seikan, tunnel, in, japan, the, holland, tunnel, and, lincoln, tunnel, between, new, jersey, and, manhattan, in, new, york, city, the, queens, midtown, tunnel, between, manhattan, and, the, borough, of, queens, on, long, island, the, detroit, windsor, tunnel, between, michigan, and, ontario, and, the, elizabeth, river, tunnels, between, norfolk, and, portsmouth, virginia, the, 1934, river, mersey, road, queensway, tunnel, the, western, scheldt, tunnel, zeeland, netherlands, and, the, north, shore, connector, tunnel, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the, sydney, harbour, tunnel, was, constructed, to, provide, a, second, harbour, crossing, and, to, alleviate, traffic, congestion, on, the, sydney, harbour, bridge, without, spoiling, the, iconic, view, other, reasons, for, choosing, a, tunnel, instead, of, a, bridge, include, avoiding, difficulties, with, tides, weather, and, shipping, during, construction, as, in, the, 51, 5, kilometre, or, 32, 0, mile, channel, tunnel, aesthetic, reasons, preserving, the, above, ground, view, landscape, and, scenery, and, also, for, weight, capacity, reasons, it, may, be, more, feasible, to, build, a, tunnel, than, a, sufficiently, strong, bridge, some, water, crossings, are, a, mixture, of, bridges, and, tunnels, such, as, the, denmark, to, sweden, link, and, the, chesapeake, bay, bridge, tunnel, in, virginia, there, are, particular, hazards, with, tunnels, especially, from, vehicle, fires, when, combustion, gases, can, asphyxiate, users, as, happened, at, the, gotthard, road, tunnel, in, switzerland, in, 2001, one, of, the, worst, railway, disasters, ever, the, balvano, train, disaster, was, caused, by, a, train, stalling, in, the, armi, tunnel, in, italy, in, 1944, killing, 426, passengers, designers, try, to, reduce, these, risks, by, installing, emergency, ventilation, systems, or, isolated, emergency, escape, tunnels, parallel, to, the, main, passage, government, funds, are, often, required, for, the, creation, of, tunnels, when, a, tunnel, is, being, planned, or, constructed, economics, and, politics, play, a, large, factor, in, the, decision, making, process, civil, engineers, usually, use, project, management, techniques, for, developing, a, major, structure, understanding, the, amount, of, time, the, project, requires, and, the, amount, of, labor, and, materials, needed, is, a, crucial, part, of, project, planning, the, project, duration, must, be, identified, using, a, work, breakdown, structure, and, critical, path, method, also, the, land, needed, for, excavation, and, construction, staging, and, the, proper, machinery, must, be, selected, large, infrastructure, projects, require, millions, or, even, billions, of, dollars, involving, long, term, financing, usually, through, issuance, of, bonds, the, costs, and, benefits, for, an, infrastructure, such, as, a, tunnel, must, be, identified, political, disputes, can, occur, as, in, 2005, when, the, us, house, of, representatives, approved, a, 100, million, federal, grant, to, build, a, tunnel, under, new, york, harbor, however, the, port, authority, of, new, york, and, new, jersey, was, not, aware, of, this, bill, and, had, not, asked, for, a, grant, for, such, a, project, increased, taxes, to, finance, a, large, project, may, cause, opposition, tunnels, are, dug, in, types, of, materials, varying, from, soft, clay, to, hard, rock, the, method, of, tunnel, construction, depends, on, such, factors, as, the, ground, conditions, the, groundwater, conditions, the, length, and, diameter, of, the, tunnel, drive, the, depth, of, the, tunnel, the, logistics, of, supporting, the, tunnel, excavation, the, final, use, and, the, shape, of, the, tunnel, and, appropriate, risk, management, there, are, three, basic, types, of, tunnel, construction, in, common, use, cut, and, cover, tunnels, are, constructed, in, a, shallow, trench, and, then, covered, over, bored, tunnels, are, constructed, in, situ, without, removing, the, ground, above, finally, a, tube, can, be, sunk, into, a, body, of, water, which, is, called, an, immersed, tunnel, cut, and, cover, is, a, simple, method, of, construction, for, shallow, tunnels, where, a, trench, is, excavated, and, roofed, over, with, an, overhead, support, system, strong, enough, to, carry, the, load, of, what, is, to, be, built, above, the, tunnel, there, are, two, basic, forms, of, cut, and, cover, tunnelling, shallow, tunnels, are, often, of, the, cut, and, cover, type, if, under, water, of, the, immersed, tube, type, while, deep, tunnels, are, excavated, often, using, a, tunnelling, shield, for, intermediate, levels, both, methods, are, possible, large, cut, and, cover, boxes, are, often, used, for, underground, metro, stations, such, as, canary, wharf, tube, station, in, london, this, construction, form, generally, has, two, levels, which, allows, economical, arrangements, for, ticket, hall, station, platforms, passenger, access, and, emergency, egress, ventilation, and, smoke, control, staff, rooms, and, equipment, rooms, the, interior, of, canary, wharf, station, has, been, likened, to, an, underground, cathedral, owing, to, the, sheer, size, of, the, excavation, this, contrasts, with, many, traditional, stations, on, london, underground, where, bored, tunnels, were, used, for, stations, and, passenger, access, nevertheless, the, original, parts, of, the, london, underground, network, the, metropolitan, and, district, railways, were, constructed, using, cut, and, cover, these, lines, pre, dated, electric, traction, and, the, proximity, to, the, surface, was, useful, to, ventilate, the, inevitable, smoke, and, steam, a, major, disadvantage, of, cut, and, cover, is, the, widespread, disruption, generated, at, the, surface, level, during, construction, this, and, the, availability, of, electric, traction, brought, about, london, underground, s, switch, to, bored, tunnels, at, a, deeper, level, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, prior, to, the, replacement, of, manual, excavation, by, the, use, of, boring, machines, victorian, tunnel, excavators, developed, a, specialized, method, called, clay, kicking, for, digging, tunnels, in, clay, based, soils, the, clay, kicker, lies, on, a, plank, at, a, 45, degree, angle, away, from, the, working, face, and, rather, than, a, mattock, with, his, hands, inserts, with, his, feet, a, tool, with, a, cup, like, rounded, end, then, turns, the, tool, with, his, hands, to, extract, a, section, of, soil, which, is, then, placed, on, the, waste, extract, clay, kicking, is, a, specialized, method, developed, in, the, united, kingdom, of, digging, tunnels, in, strong, clay, based, soil, structures, this, method, of, cut, and, cover, construction, required, relatively, little, disturbance, of, property, during, the, renewal, of, the, united, kingdom, s, then, ancient, sewerage, systems, it, was, also, used, during, the, first, world, war, by, royal, engineer, tunnelling, companies, placing, mines, beneath, german, lines, because, it, was, almost, silent, and, so, not, susceptible, to, listening, methods, of, detection, tunnel, boring, machines, tbms, and, associated, back, up, systems, are, used, to, highly, automate, the, entire, tunnelling, process, reducing, tunnelling, costs, in, certain, predominantly, urban, applications, tunnel, boring, is, viewed, as, a, quick, and, cost, effective, alternative, to, laying, surface, rails, and, roads, expensive, compulsory, purchase, of, buildings, and, land, with, potentially, lengthy, planning, inquiries, is, eliminated, disadvantages, of, tbms, arise, from, their, usually, large, size, the, difficulty, of, transporting, the, large, tbm, to, the, site, of, tunnel, construction, or, alternatively, the, high, cost, of, assembling, the, tbm, on, site, often, within, the, confines, of, the, tunnel, being, constructed, there, are, a, variety, of, tbm, designs, that, can, operate, in, a, variety, of, conditions, from, hard, rock, to, soft, water, bearing, ground, some, tbms, the, bentonite, slurry, and, earth, pressure, balance, types, have, pressurized, compartments, at, the, front, end, allowing, them, to, be, used, in, difficult, conditions, below, the, water, table, this, pressurizes, the, ground, ahead, of, the, tbm, cutter, head, to, balance, the, water, pressure, the, operators, work, in, normal, air, pressure, behind, the, pressurized, compartment, but, may, occasionally, have, to, enter, that, compartment, to, renew, or, repair, the, cutters, this, requires, special, precautions, such, as, local, ground, treatment, or, halting, the, tbm, at, a, position, free, from, water, despite, these, difficulties, tbms, are, now, preferred, over, the, older, method, of, tunnelling, in, compressed, air, with, an, airlock, decompression, chamber, some, way, back, from, the, tbm, which, required, operators, to, work, in, high, pressure, and, go, through, decompression, procedures, at, the, end, of, their, shifts, much, like, deep, sea, divers, in, february, 2010, aker, wirth, delivered, a, tbm, to, switzerland, for, the, expansion, of, the, linth, limmern, power, stations, located, south, of, linthal, in, the, canton, of, glarus, the, borehole, has, a, diameter, of, 8, 03, metres, 26, 3, ft, the, four, tbms, used, for, excavating, the, 57, kilometre, 35, mi, gotthard, base, tunnel, in, switzerland, had, a, diameter, of, about, 9, metres, 30, ft, a, larger, tbm, was, built, to, bore, the, green, heart, tunnel, dutch, tunnel, groene, hart, as, part, of, the, hsl, zuid, in, the, netherlands, with, a, diameter, of, 14, 87, metres, 48, 8, ft, this, in, turn, was, superseded, by, the, madrid, m30, ringroad, spain, and, the, chong, ming, tunnels, in, shanghai, china, all, of, these, machines, were, built, at, least, partly, by, herrenknecht, as, of, august, 2013, the, world, s, largest, tbm, was, big, bertha, a, 17, 5, metre, 57, 5, ft, diameter, machine, built, by, hitachi, zosen, corporation, which, dug, the, alaskan, way, viaduct, replacement, tunnel, in, seattle, washington, us, a, temporary, access, shaft, is, sometimes, necessary, during, the, excavation, of, a, tunnel, they, are, usually, circular, and, go, straight, down, until, they, reach, the, level, at, which, the, tunnel, is, going, to, be, built, a, shaft, normally, has, concrete, walls, and, is, usually, built, to, be, permanent, once, the, access, shafts, are, complete, tbms, are, lowered, to, the, bottom, and, excavation, can, start, shafts, are, the, main, entrance, in, and, out, of, the, tunnel, until, the, project, is, completed, if, a, tunnel, is, going, to, be, long, multiple, shafts, at, various, locations, may, be, bored, so, that, entrance, to, the, tunnel, is, closer, to, the, unexcavated, area, once, construction, is, complete, construction, access, shafts, are, often, used, as, ventilation, shafts, and, may, also, be, used, as, emergency, exits, the, new, austrian, tunnelling, method, natm, also, referred, to, as, the, sequential, excavation, method, sem, was, developed, in, the, 1960s, the, main, idea, of, this, method, is, to, use, the, geological, stress, of, the, surrounding, rock, mass, to, stabilize, the, tunnel, by, allowing, a, measured, relaxation, and, stress, reassignment, into, the, surrounding, rock, to, prevent, full, loads, becoming, imposed, on, the, supports, based, on, geotechnical, measurements, an, optimal, cross, section, is, computed, the, excavation, is, protected, by, a, layer, of, sprayed, concrete, commonly, referred, to, as, shotcrete, other, support, measures, can, include, steel, arches, rock, bolts, and, mesh, technological, developments, in, sprayed, concrete, technology, have, resulted, in, steel, and, polypropylene, fibers, being, added, to, the, concrete, mix, to, improve, lining, strength, this, creates, a, natural, load, bearing, ring, which, minimizes, the, rock, s, deformation, by, special, monitoring, the, natm, method, is, flexible, even, at, surprising, changes, of, the, geomechanical, rock, consistency, during, the, tunneling, work, the, measured, rock, properties, lead, to, appropriate, tools, for, tunnel, strengthening, in, pipe, jacking, hydraulic, jacks, are, used, to, push, specially, made, pipes, through, the, ground, behind, a, tbm, or, shield, this, method, is, commonly, used, to, create, tunnels, under, existing, structures, such, as, roads, or, railways, tunnels, constructed, by, pipe, jacking, are, normally, small, diameter, bores, with, a, maximum, size, of, around, 3, 2, metres, 10, ft, box, jacking, is, similar, to, pipe, jacking, but, instead, of, jacking, tubes, a, box, shaped, tunnel, is, used, jacked, boxes, can, be, a, much, larger, span, than, a, pipe, jack, with, the, span, of, some, box, jacks, in, excess, of, 20, metres, 66, ft, a, cutting, head, is, normally, used, at, the, front, of, the, box, being, jacked, and, spoil, removal, is, normally, by, excavator, from, within, the, box, recent, developments, of, the, jacked, arch, and, jacked, deck, have, enabled, longer, and, larger, structures, to, be, installed, to, close, accuracy, there, are, also, several, approaches, to, underwater, tunnels, the, two, most, common, being, bored, tunnels, or, immersed, tubes, examples, are, bj, rvika, tunnel, and, marmaray, submerged, floating, tunnels, are, a, novel, approach, under, consideration, however, no, such, tunnels, have, been, constructed, to, date, during, construction, of, a, tunnel, it, is, often, convenient, to, install, a, temporary, railway, particularly, to, remove, excavated, spoil, often, narrow, gauge, so, that, it, can, be, double, track, to, allow, the, operation, of, empty, and, loaded, trains, at, the, same, time, the, temporary, way, is, replaced, by, the, permanent, way, at, completion, thus, explaining, the, term, perway, the, vehicles, or, traffic, using, a, tunnel, can, outgrow, it, requiring, replacement, or, enlargement, an, open, building, pit, consists, of, a, horizontal, and, a, vertical, boundary, that, keeps, groundwater, and, soil, out, of, the, pit, there, are, several, potential, alternatives, and, combinations, for, horizontal, and, vertical, building, pit, boundaries, the, most, important, difference, with, cut, and, cover, is, that, the, open, building, pit, is, muted, after, tunnel, construction, no, roof, is, placed, some, tunnels, are, double, deck, for, example, the, two, major, segments, of, the, san, francisco, oakland, bay, bridge, completed, in, 1936, are, linked, by, a, 160, metre, 540, ft, double, deck, tunnel, section, through, yerba, buena, island, the, largest, diameter, bored, tunnel, in, the, world, at, construction, this, was, a, combination, bidirectional, rail, and, truck, pathway, on, the, lower, deck, with, automobiles, above, now, converted, to, one, way, road, vehicle, traffic, on, each, deck, in, turkey, the, eurasia, tunnel, under, the, bosphorus, opened, in, 2016, has, at, its, core, a, 5, 4, km, 3, 4, mi, two, deck, road, tunnel, with, two, lanes, on, each, deck, additionally, in, 2015, the, turkish, government, announced, that, it, will, build, three, level, tunnel, also, under, the, bosporus, the, tunnel, is, intended, to, carry, both, the, istanbul, metro, and, a, two, level, highway, over, a, length, of, 6, 5, km, 4, 0, mi, the, french, a86, duplex, tunnel, in, west, paris, consists, of, two, bored, tunnel, tubes, the, eastern, one, of, which, has, two, levels, for, light, motorized, vehicles, over, a, length, of, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, although, each, level, offers, a, physical, height, of, 2, 54, m, 8, 3, ft, only, traffic, up, to, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, tall, is, allowed, in, this, tunnel, tube, and, motorcyclists, are, directed, to, the, other, tube, each, level, was, built, with, a, three, lane, roadway, but, only, two, lanes, per, level, are, used, the, third, serves, as, a, hard, shoulder, within, the, tunnel, the, a86, duplex, is, europe, s, longest, double, deck, tunnel, in, shanghai, china, a, 2, 8, km, 1, 7, mi, two, tube, double, deck, tunnel, was, built, starting, in, 2002, in, each, tube, of, the, fuxing, road, tunnel, both, decks, are, for, motor, vehicles, in, each, direction, only, cars, and, taxis, travel, on, the, 2, 6, m, 8, 5, ft, high, two, lane, upper, deck, and, heavier, vehicles, like, trucks, and, buses, as, well, as, cars, may, use, the, 4, 0, m, 13, ft, high, single, lane, lower, level, in, the, netherlands, a, 2, 3, km, 1, 4, mi, two, storey, eight, lane, cut, and, cover, road, tunnel, under, the, city, of, maastricht, was, opened, in, 2016, each, level, accommodates, a, full, height, two, by, two, lane, highway, the, two, lower, tubes, of, the, tunnel, carry, the, a2, motorway, which, originates, in, amsterdam, through, the, city, and, the, two, upper, tubes, take, the, n2, regional, highway, for, local, traffic, the, alaskan, way, viaduct, replacement, tunnel, is, a, 3, 3, billion, 2, 83, kilometre, 1, 76, mi, double, decker, bored, highway, tunnel, under, downtown, seattle, construction, began, in, july, 2013, using, bertha, at, the, time, the, world, s, largest, earth, pressure, balance, tunnel, boring, machine, with, a, 17, 5, metre, 57, 5, ft, cutterhead, diameter, after, several, delays, tunnel, boring, was, completed, in, april, 2017, and, the, tunnel, opened, to, traffic, on, 4, february, 2019, new, york, city, s, 63rd, street, tunnel, under, the, east, river, between, the, boroughs, of, manhattan, and, queens, was, intended, to, carry, subway, trains, on, the, upper, level, and, long, island, rail, road, commuter, trains, on, the, lower, level, construction, started, in, 1969, and, the, two, sides, of, the, tunnel, were, bored, through, in, 1972, the, upper, level, used, by, the, ind, 63rd, street, line, f, and, f, train, of, the, new, york, city, subway, was, not, opened, for, passenger, service, until, 1989, the, lower, level, intended, for, commuter, rail, saw, passenger, service, after, completion, of, the, east, side, access, project, in, late, 2022, in, the, uk, the, 1934, queensway, tunnel, under, the, river, mersey, between, liverpool, and, birkenhead, was, originally, to, have, road, vehicles, running, on, the, upper, deck, and, trams, on, the, lower, during, construction, the, tram, usage, was, cancelled, the, lower, section, is, only, used, for, cables, pipes, and, emergency, accident, refuge, enclosures, hong, kong, s, lion, rock, tunnel, built, in, the, mid, 1960s, connecting, new, kowloon, and, sha, tin, carries, a, motorway, but, also, serves, as, an, aqueduct, featuring, a, gallery, containing, five, water, mains, lines, with, diameters, between, 1, 2, and, 1, 5, m, 4, and, 5, ft, below, the, road, section, of, the, tunnel, wuhan, s, yangtze, river, highway, and, railway, tunnel, is, a, 2, 59, km, 1, 61, mi, two, tube, double, deck, tunnel, under, the, yangtze, river, completed, in, 2018, each, tube, carries, three, lanes, of, local, traffic, on, the, top, deck, with, one, track, wuhan, metro, line, 7, on, the, lower, deck, mount, baker, tunnel, has, three, levels, the, bottom, level, is, to, be, used, by, sound, transit, light, rail, the, middle, level, is, used, by, car, traffic, and, the, top, layer, is, for, bicycle, and, pedestrian, access, some, tunnels, have, more, than, one, purpose, the, smart, tunnel, in, malaysia, is, the, first, multipurpose, stormwater, management, and, road, tunnel, in, the, world, created, to, convey, both, traffic, and, occasional, flood, waters, in, kuala, lumpur, when, necessary, floodwater, is, first, diverted, into, a, separate, bypass, tunnel, located, underneath, the, 4, 0, km, 2, 5, mi, double, deck, roadway, tunnel, in, this, scenario, traffic, continues, normally, only, during, heavy, prolonged, rains, when, the, threat, of, extreme, flooding, is, high, the, upper, tunnel, tube, is, closed, off, to, vehicles, and, automated, flood, control, gates, are, opened, so, that, water, can, be, diverted, through, both, tunnels, common, utility, ducts, or, utility, tunnels, carry, two, or, more, utility, lines, through, co, location, of, different, utilities, in, one, tunnel, organizations, are, able, to, reduce, the, costs, of, building, and, maintaining, utilities, over, bridges, can, sometimes, be, built, by, covering, a, road, or, river, or, railway, with, brick, or, steel, arches, and, then, leveling, the, surface, with, earth, in, railway, parlance, a, surface, level, track, which, has, been, built, or, covered, over, is, normally, called, a, covered, way, snow, sheds, are, a, kind, of, artificial, tunnel, built, to, protect, a, railway, from, avalanches, of, snow, similarly, the, stanwell, park, new, south, wales, steel, tunnel, on, the, illawarra, railway, line, protects, the, line, from, rockfalls, an, underpass, is, a, road, or, railway, or, other, passageway, passing, under, another, road, or, railway, under, an, overpass, this, is, not, strictly, a, tunnel, owing, to, the, enclosed, space, of, a, tunnel, fires, can, have, very, serious, effects, on, users, the, main, dangers, are, gas, and, smoke, production, with, even, low, concentrations, of, carbon, monoxide, being, highly, toxic, fires, killed, 11, people, in, the, gotthard, tunnel, fire, of, 2001, for, example, all, of, the, victims, succumbing, to, smoke, and, gas, inhalation, over, 400, passengers, died, in, the, balvano, train, disaster, in, italy, in, 1944, when, the, locomotive, halted, in, a, long, tunnel, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, was, the, main, cause, of, death, in, the, caldecott, tunnel, fire, of, 1982, the, majority, of, fatalities, were, caused, by, toxic, smoke, rather, than, by, the, initial, crash, likewise, 84, people, were, killed, in, the, paris, m, tro, train, fire, of, 1904, motor, vehicle, tunnels, usually, require, ventilation, shafts, and, powered, fans, to, remove, toxic, exhaust, gases, during, routine, operation, rail, tunnels, usually, require, fewer, air, changes, per, hour, but, still, may, require, forced, air, ventilation, both, types, of, tunnels, often, have, provisions, to, increase, ventilation, under, emergency, conditions, such, as, a, fire, although, there, is, a, risk, of, increasing, the, rate, of, combustion, through, increased, airflow, the, primary, focus, is, on, providing, breathable, air, to, persons, trapped, in, the, tunnel, as, well, as, firefighters, the, aerodynamic, pressure, wave, produced, by, high, speed, trains, entering, a, tunnel, reflect, at, its, open, ends, and, change, sign, compression, wavefront, changes, to, rarefaction, wavefront, and, vice, versa, when, two, wavefronts, of, the, same, sign, meet, the, train, significant, and, rapid, air, pressure, may, cause, ear, discomfort, for, passengers, and, crew, when, a, high, speed, train, exits, a, tunnel, a, loud, tunnel, boom, may, occur, which, can, disturb, residents, near, the, mouth, of, the, tunnel, and, it, is, exacerbated, in, mountain, valleys, where, the, sound, can, echo, when, there, is, a, parallel, separate, tunnel, available, airtight, but, unlocked, emergency, doors, are, usually, provided, which, allow, trapped, personnel, to, escape, from, a, smoke, filled, tunnel, to, the, parallel, tube, larger, heavily, used, tunnels, such, as, the, big, dig, tunnel, in, boston, massachusetts, may, have, a, dedicated, 24, hour, staffed, operations, center, which, monitors, and, reports, on, traffic, conditions, and, responds, to, emergencies, video, surveillance, equipment, is, often, used, and, real, time, pictures, of, traffic, conditions, for, some, highways, may, be, viewable, by, the, general, public, via, the, internet, a, database, of, seismic, damage, to, underground, structures, using, 217, case, histories, shows, the, following, general, observations, can, be, made, regarding, the, seismic, performance, of, underground, structures, earthquakes, are, one, of, nature, s, most, formidable, threats, a, magnitude, 6, 7, earthquake, shook, the, san, fernando, valley, in, los, angeles, in, 1994, the, earthquake, caused, extensive, damage, to, various, structures, including, buildings, freeway, overpasses, and, road, systems, throughout, the, area, the, national, center, for, environmental, information, estimates, total, damages, to, be, 40, billion, dollars, according, to, an, article, issued, by, steve, hymon, of, thesource, transportation, news, and, views, there, was, no, serious, damage, sustained, by, the, la, subway, system, metro, the, owner, of, the, la, subway, system, issued, a, statement, through, their, engineering, staff, about, the, design, and, consideration, that, goes, into, a, tunnel, system, engineers, and, architects, perform, extensive, analysis, as, to, how, hard, they, expect, earthquakes, to, hit, that, area, all, of, this, goes, into, the, overall, design, and, flexibility, of, the, tunnel, this, same, trend, of, limited, subway, damage, following, an, earthquake, can, be, seen, in, many, other, places, in, 1985, a, magnitude, 8, 1, earthquake, shook, mexico, city, there, was, no, damage, to, the, subway, system, and, in, fact, the, subway, systems, served, as, a, lifeline, for, emergency, personnel, and, evacuations, a, magnitude, 7, 2, ripped, through, kobe, japan, in, 1995, leaving, no, damage, to, the, tunnels, themselves, entry, portals, sustained, minor, damages, however, these, damages, were, attributed, to, inadequate, earthquake, design, that, originated, from, the, original, construction, date, of, 1965, in, 2010, a, magnitude, 8, 8, massive, by, any, scale, afflicted, chile, entrance, stations, to, subway, systems, suffered, minor, damages, and, the, subway, system, was, down, for, the, rest, of, the, day, by, the, next, afternoon, the, subway, system, was, operational, again, the, history, of, ancient, tunnels, and, tunneling, in, the, world, is, reviewed, in, various, sources, which, include, many, examples, of, these, structures, that, were, built, for, different, purposes, some, well, known, ancient, and, modern, tunnels, are, briefly, introduced, below, the, use, of, tunnels, for, mining, is, called, drift, mining, some, tunnels, are, not, for, transport, at, all, but, rather, are, fortifications, for, example, mittelwerk, and, cheyenne, mountain, complex, excavation, techniques, as, well, as, the, construction, of, underground, bunkers, and, other, habitable, areas, are, often, associated, with, military, use, during, armed, conflict, or, civilian, responses, to, threat, of, attack, another, use, for, tunnels, was, for, the, storage, of, chemical, weapons, secret, tunnels, have, given, entrance, to, or, escape, from, an, area, such, as, the, cu, chi, tunnels, or, the, smuggling, tunnels, in, the, gaza, strip, which, connect, it, to, egypt, although, the, underground, railroad, network, used, to, transport, escaped, slaves, was, underground, mostly, in, the, sense, of, secrecy, hidden, tunnels, were, occasionally, used, secret, tunnels, were, also, used, during, the, cold, war, under, the, berlin, wall, and, elsewhere, to, smuggle, refugees, and, for, espionage, smugglers, use, secret, tunnels, to, transport, or, store, contraband, such, as, illegal, drugs, and, weapons, elaborately, engineered, 300, metre, 1, 000, ft, tunnels, built, to, smuggle, drugs, across, the, mexico, us, border, were, estimated, to, require, up, to, 9, months, to, complete, and, an, expenditure, of, up, to, 1, million, some, of, these, tunnels, were, equipped, with, lighting, ventilation, telephones, drainage, pumps, hydraulic, elevators, and, in, at, least, one, instance, an, electrified, rail, transport, system, secret, tunnels, have, also, been, used, by, thieves, to, break, into, bank, vaults, and, retail, stores, after, hours, several, tunnels, have, been, discovered, by, the, border, security, forces, across, the, line, of, control, along, the, india, pakistan, border, mainly, to, allow, terrorists, access, to, the, indian, territory, of, jammu, and, kashmir, the, actual, usage, of, erdstall, tunnels, is, unknown, but, theories, connect, it, to, a, rebirth, ritual
