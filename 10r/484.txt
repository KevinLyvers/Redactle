a, weapon, arm, or, armament, is, any, implement, or, device, that, is, used, to, deter, threaten, inflict, physical, damage, harm, or, kill, weapons, are, used, to, increase, the, efficacy, and, efficiency, of, activities, such, as, hunting, crime, e, g, murder, law, enforcement, self, defense, warfare, or, suicide, in, a, broader, context, weapons, may, be, construed, to, include, anything, used, to, gain, a, tactical, strategic, material, or, mental, advantage, over, an, adversary, or, enemy, target, while, ordinary, objects, such, as, sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, and, vehicles, can, be, used, as, weapons, many, objects, are, expressly, designed, for, the, purpose, these, range, from, simple, implements, such, as, clubs, axes, spears, and, swords, to, complicated, modern, firearms, tanks, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, biological, weapons, and, cyberweapons, something, that, has, been, repurposed, converted, or, enhanced, to, become, a, weapon, of, war, is, termed, weaponized, such, as, a, weaponized, virus, or, weaponized, laser, the, use, of, weapons, has, been, a, major, driver, of, cultural, evolution, and, human, history, up, to, today, since, weapons, are, a, type, of, tool, that, is, used, to, dominate, and, subdue, autonomous, agents, such, as, animals, and, by, doing, so, allow, for, an, expansion, of, the, cultural, niche, while, simultaneously, other, weapon, users, i, e, agents, such, as, humans, groups, and, cultures, are, able, to, adapt, to, the, weapons, of, enemies, by, learning, triggering, a, continuous, process, of, competitive, technological, skill, and, cognitive, improvement, arms, race, the, use, of, objects, as, weapons, has, been, observed, among, chimpanzees, leading, to, speculation, that, early, hominids, used, weapons, as, early, as, five, million, years, ago, however, this, cannot, be, confirmed, using, physical, evidence, because, wooden, clubs, spears, and, unshaped, stones, would, have, left, an, ambiguous, record, the, earliest, unambiguous, weapons, to, be, found, are, the, sch, ningen, spears, eight, wooden, throwing, spears, dating, back, more, than, 300, 000, years, at, the, site, of, nataruk, in, turkana, kenya, numerous, human, skeletons, dating, to, 10, 000, years, ago, may, present, evidence, of, traumatic, injuries, to, the, head, neck, ribs, knees, and, hands, including, obsidian, projectiles, embedded, in, the, bones, that, might, have, been, caused, by, arrows, and, clubs, during, conflict, between, two, hunter, gatherer, groups, but, the, interpretation, of, warfare, at, nataruk, has, been, challenged, due, to, conflicting, evidence, the, earliest, ancient, weapons, were, evolutionary, improvements, of, late, neolithic, implements, but, significant, improvements, in, materials, and, crafting, techniques, led, to, a, series, of, revolutions, in, military, technology, the, development, of, metal, tools, began, with, copper, during, the, copper, age, about, 3, 300, bc, and, was, followed, by, the, bronze, age, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, bronze, age, sword, and, similar, weapons, during, the, bronze, age, the, first, defensive, structures, and, fortifications, appeared, as, well, indicating, an, increased, need, for, security, weapons, designed, to, breach, fortifications, followed, soon, after, such, as, the, battering, ram, which, was, in, use, by, 2500, bc, the, development, of, ironworking, around, 1300, bc, in, greece, had, an, important, impact, on, the, development, of, ancient, weapons, it, was, not, the, introduction, of, early, iron, age, swords, however, as, they, were, not, superior, to, their, bronze, predecessors, but, rather, the, domestication, of, the, horse, and, widespread, use, of, spoked, wheels, by, c, 2000, bc, this, led, to, the, creation, of, the, light, horse, drawn, chariot, whose, improved, mobility, proved, important, during, this, era, spoke, wheeled, chariot, usage, peaked, around, 1300, bc, and, then, declined, ceasing, to, be, militarily, relevant, by, the, 4th, century, bc, cavalry, developed, once, horses, were, bred, to, support, the, weight, of, a, human, the, horse, extended, the, range, and, increased, the, speed, of, attacks, alexander, s, conquest, saw, the, increased, use, of, spears, and, shields, in, the, middle, east, and, western, asia, as, a, result, greek, culture, spread, which, saw, many, greek, and, other, european, weapons, be, used, in, these, regions, and, as, a, result, many, of, these, weapons, were, adapted, to, fit, there, new, use, in, war, in, addition, to, land, based, weaponry, warships, such, as, the, trireme, were, in, use, by, the, 7th, century, bc, during, the, first, first, punic, war, the, use, of, advanced, warships, contributed, to, a, roman, victory, over, the, carthaginians, european, warfare, during, post, classical, history, was, dominated, by, elite, groups, of, knights, supported, by, massed, infantry, both, in, combat, and, ranged, roles, they, were, involved, in, mobile, combat, and, sieges, which, involved, various, siege, weapons, and, tactics, knights, on, horseback, developed, tactics, for, charging, with, lances, providing, an, impact, on, the, enemy, formations, and, then, drawing, more, practical, weapons, such, as, swords, once, they, entered, melee, by, contrast, infantry, in, the, age, before, structured, formations, relied, on, cheap, sturdy, weapons, such, as, spears, and, billhooks, in, close, combat, and, bows, from, a, distance, as, armies, became, more, professional, their, equipment, was, standardized, and, infantry, transitioned, to, pikes, pikes, are, normally, seven, to, eight, feet, in, length, and, used, in, conjunction, with, smaller, sidearms, short, swords, in, eastern, and, middle, eastern, warfare, similar, tactics, were, developed, independent, of, european, influences, the, introduction, of, gunpowder, from, asia, at, the, end, of, this, period, revolutionized, warfare, formations, of, musketeers, protected, by, pikemen, came, to, dominate, open, battles, and, the, cannon, replaced, the, trebuchet, as, the, dominant, siege, weapon, the, ottoman, used, the, cannon, to, destroy, much, of, the, fortifications, at, constantinople, which, would, change, warfare, as, gunpowder, became, more, available, and, technology, improved, the, european, renaissance, marked, the, beginning, of, the, implementation, of, firearms, in, western, warfare, guns, and, rockets, were, introduced, to, the, battlefield, firearms, are, qualitatively, different, from, earlier, weapons, because, they, release, energy, from, combustible, propellants, such, as, gunpowder, rather, than, from, a, counterweight, or, spring, this, energy, is, released, very, rapidly, and, can, be, replicated, without, much, effort, by, the, user, therefore, even, early, firearms, such, as, the, arquebus, were, much, more, powerful, than, human, powered, weapons, firearms, became, increasingly, important, and, effective, during, the, 16th, 19th, centuries, with, progressive, improvements, in, ignition, mechanisms, followed, by, revolutionary, changes, in, ammunition, handling, and, propellant, during, the, american, civil, war, new, applications, of, firearms, including, the, machine, gun, and, ironclad, warship, emerged, that, would, still, be, recognizable, and, useful, military, weapons, today, particularly, in, limited, conflicts, in, the, 19th, century, warship, propulsion, changed, from, sail, power, to, fossil, fuel, powered, steam, engines, since, the, mid, 18th, century, north, american, french, indian, war, through, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, human, powered, weapons, were, reduced, from, the, primary, weaponry, of, the, battlefield, to, yielding, gunpowder, based, weaponry, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, age, of, rifles, this, period, was, characterized, by, the, development, of, firearms, for, infantry, and, cannons, for, support, as, well, as, the, beginnings, of, mechanized, weapons, such, as, the, machine, gun, artillery, pieces, such, as, howitzers, were, able, to, destroy, masonry, fortresses, and, other, fortifications, and, this, single, invention, caused, a, revolution, in, military, affairs, establishing, tactics, and, doctrine, that, are, still, in, use, today, an, important, feature, of, industrial, age, warfare, was, technological, escalation, innovations, were, rapidly, matched, through, replication, or, countered, by, another, innovation, world, war, i, marked, the, entry, of, fully, industrialized, warfare, as, well, as, weapons, of, mass, destruction, e, g, chemical, and, biological, weapons, and, new, weapons, were, developed, quickly, to, meet, wartime, needs, the, technological, escalation, during, world, war, i, was, profound, including, the, wide, introduction, of, aircraft, into, warfare, and, naval, warfare, with, the, introduction, of, aircraft, carriers, above, all, it, promised, the, military, commanders, independence, from, horses, and, a, resurgence, in, maneuver, warfare, through, the, extensive, use, of, motor, vehicles, the, changes, that, these, military, technologies, underwent, were, evolutionary, but, defined, their, development, for, the, rest, of, the, century, this, period, of, innovation, in, weapon, design, continued, in, the, interwar, period, between, wwi, and, wwii, with, the, continuous, evolution, of, weapon, systems, by, all, major, industrial, powers, the, major, armament, firms, were, schneider, creusot, based, in, france, koda, works, czechoslovakia, and, vickers, great, britain, the, 1920s, were, committed, to, disarmament, and, the, outlawing, of, war, and, poison, gas, but, rearmament, picked, up, rapidly, in, the, 1930s, the, munitions, makers, responded, nimbly, to, the, rapidly, shifting, strategic, and, economic, landscape, the, main, purchasers, of, munitions, from, the, big, three, companies, were, romania, yugoslavia, greece, and, turkey, and, to, a, lesser, extent, poland, finland, the, baltic, states, and, the, soviet, union, realistic, critics, understood, that, war, could, not, really, be, outlawed, but, its, worst, excesses, might, be, banned, poison, gas, became, the, focus, of, a, worldwide, crusade, in, the, 1920s, poison, gas, did, not, win, battles, and, the, generals, did, not, want, it, the, soldiers, hated, it, far, more, intensely, than, bullets, or, explosive, shells, by, 1918, chemical, shells, made, up, 35, percent, of, french, ammunition, supplies, 25, percent, of, british, and, 20, percent, of, american, stock, the, protocol, for, the, prohibition, of, the, use, in, war, of, asphyxiating, poisonous, or, other, gases, and, of, bacteriological, methods, of, warfare, also, known, as, the, geneva, protocol, was, issued, in, 1925, and, was, accepted, as, policy, by, all, major, countries, in, 1937, poison, gas, was, manufactured, in, large, quantities, but, not, used, except, against, nations, that, lacked, modern, weapons, or, gas, masks, many, modern, military, weapons, particularly, ground, based, ones, are, relatively, minor, improvements, to, weapon, systems, developed, during, world, war, ii, world, war, ii, marked, perhaps, the, most, frantic, period, of, weapon, development, in, the, history, of, humanity, massive, numbers, of, new, designs, and, concepts, were, fielded, and, all, existing, technologies, were, improved, between, 1939, and, 1945, the, most, powerful, weapon, invented, during, this, period, was, the, nuclear, bomb, however, many, other, weapons, influenced, the, world, such, as, jet, aircraft, and, radar, but, were, overshadowed, by, the, visibility, of, nuclear, weapons, and, long, range, rockets, since, the, realization, of, mutual, assured, destruction, mad, the, nuclear, option, of, all, out, war, is, no, longer, considered, a, survivable, scenario, during, the, cold, war, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, both, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, engaged, in, a, nuclear, arms, race, each, country, and, their, allies, continually, attempted, to, out, develop, each, other, in, the, field, of, nuclear, armaments, once, the, joint, technological, capabilities, reached, the, point, of, being, able, to, ensure, the, destruction, of, the, earth, by, 100, fold, a, new, tactic, had, to, be, developed, with, this, realization, armaments, development, funding, shifted, back, to, primarily, sponsoring, the, development, of, conventional, arms, technologies, for, support, of, limited, wars, rather, than, total, war, the, arms, industry, is, a, global, industry, that, involves, the, sale, and, manufacture, of, weaponry, it, consists, of, a, commercial, industry, involved, in, the, research, and, development, engineering, production, and, servicing, of, military, material, equipment, and, facilities, many, industrialized, countries, have, a, domestic, arms, industry, to, supply, their, own, military, forces, and, some, also, have, a, substantial, trade, in, weapons, for, use, by, their, citizens, for, self, defense, hunting, or, sporting, purposes, contracts, to, supply, a, given, country, s, military, are, awarded, by, governments, making, arms, contracts, of, substantial, political, importance, the, link, between, politics, and, the, arms, trade, can, result, in, the, development, of, a, military, industrial, complex, where, the, armed, forces, commerce, and, politics, become, closely, linked, according, to, research, institute, sipri, the, volume, of, international, transfers, of, major, weapons, in, 2010, 2014, was, 16, percent, higher, than, in, 2005, 2009, and, the, arms, sales, of, the, world, s, 100, largest, private, arms, producing, and, military, services, companies, totaled, 420, billion, in, 2018, the, production, possession, trade, and, use, of, many, weapons, are, controlled, this, may, be, at, a, local, or, central, government, level, or, by, international, treaty, examples, of, such, controls, include, all, countries, have, laws, and, policies, regulating, aspects, such, as, the, manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, and, use, of, small, arms, by, civilians, countries, that, regulate, access, to, firearms, will, typically, restrict, access, to, certain, categories, of, firearms, and, then, restrict, the, categories, of, persons, who, may, be, granted, a, license, for, access, to, such, firearms, there, may, be, separate, licenses, for, hunting, sport, shooting, a, k, a, target, shooting, self, defense, collecting, and, concealed, carry, with, different, sets, of, requirements, permissions, and, responsibilities, international, treaties, and, agreements, place, restrictions, on, the, development, production, stockpiling, proliferation, and, usage, of, weapons, from, small, arms, and, heavy, weapons, to, weapons, of, mass, destruction, arms, control, is, typically, exercised, through, the, use, of, diplomacy, which, seeks, to, impose, such, limitations, upon, consenting, participants, although, it, may, also, comprise, efforts, by, a, nation, or, group, of, nations, to, enforce, limitations, upon, a, non, consenting, country, arms, trafficking, is, the, trafficking, of, contraband, weapons, and, ammunition, what, constitutes, legal, trade, in, firearms, varies, widely, depending, on, local, and, national, laws, in, 2001, the, united, nations, had, made, a, protocol, against, the, manufacturing, and, trafficking, of, illicit, arms, this, protocol, made, governments, dispose, illegal, arms, and, to, licence, new, firearms, being, produced, to, ensure, them, being, legitimate, it, was, signed, by, 122, parties, there, are, a, number, of, issues, around, the, potential, ongoing, risks, from, deployed, weapons, the, safe, storage, of, weapons, and, their, eventual, disposal, when, they, are, no, longer, effective, or, safe, strange, and, exotic, weapons, are, a, recurring, feature, or, theme, in, science, fiction, in, some, cases, weapons, first, introduced, in, science, fiction, have, now, become, a, reality, other, science, fiction, weapons, such, as, force, fields, and, stasis, fields, remain, purely, fictional, and, are, often, beyond, the, realms, of, known, physical, possibility, at, its, most, prosaic, science, fiction, features, an, endless, variety, of, sidearms, mostly, variations, on, real, weapons, such, as, guns, and, swords, among, the, best, known, of, these, are, the, phaser, used, in, the, star, trek, television, series, films, and, novels, and, the, lightsaber, and, blaster, featured, in, the, star, wars, movies, comics, novels, and, tv, series, in, addition, to, adding, action, and, entertainment, value, weaponry, in, science, fiction, sometimes, becomes, a, theme, when, it, touches, on, deeper, concerns, often, motivated, by, contemporary, issues, one, example, is, science, fiction, that, deals, with, weapons, of, mass, destruction, like, doomsday, devices
