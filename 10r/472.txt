in, medicine, a, prosthesis, pl, prostheses, from, ancient, greek, romanized, pr, sthesis, lit, addition, application, attachment, or, a, prosthetic, implant, is, an, artificial, device, that, replaces, a, missing, body, part, which, may, be, lost, through, physical, trauma, disease, or, a, condition, present, at, birth, congenital, disorder, prostheses, are, intended, to, restore, the, normal, functions, of, the, missing, body, part, amputee, rehabilitation, is, primarily, coordinated, by, a, physiatrist, as, part, of, an, inter, disciplinary, team, consisting, of, physiatrists, prosthetists, nurses, physical, therapists, and, occupational, therapists, prostheses, can, be, created, by, hand, or, with, computer, aided, design, cad, a, software, interface, that, helps, creators, design, and, analyze, the, creation, with, computer, generated, 2, d, and, 3, d, graphics, as, well, as, analysis, and, optimization, tools, a, person, s, prosthesis, should, be, designed, and, assembled, according, to, the, person, s, appearance, and, functional, needs, for, instance, a, person, may, need, a, transradial, prosthesis, but, the, person, needs, to, choose, between, an, aesthetic, functional, device, a, myoelectric, device, a, body, powered, device, or, an, activity, specific, device, the, person, s, future, goals, and, economical, capabilities, may, help, them, choose, between, one, or, more, devices, craniofacial, prostheses, include, intra, oral, and, extra, oral, prostheses, extra, oral, prostheses, are, further, divided, into, hemifacial, auricular, ear, nasal, orbital, and, ocular, intra, oral, prostheses, include, dental, prostheses, such, as, dentures, obturators, and, dental, implants, prostheses, of, the, neck, include, larynx, substitutes, trachea, and, upper, esophageal, replacements, somato, prostheses, of, the, torso, include, breast, prostheses, which, may, be, either, single, or, bilateral, full, breast, devices, or, nipple, prostheses, penile, prostheses, are, used, to, treat, erectile, dysfunction, correct, penile, deformity, perform, phalloplasty, procedures, in, cisgender, men, and, to, build, a, new, penis, in, female, to, male, gender, reassignment, surgeries, limb, prostheses, include, both, upper, and, lower, extremity, prostheses, upper, extremity, prostheses, are, used, at, varying, levels, of, amputation, forequarter, shoulder, disarticulation, transhumeral, prosthesis, elbow, disarticulation, transradial, prosthesis, wrist, disarticulation, full, hand, partial, hand, finger, partial, finger, a, transradial, prosthesis, is, an, artificial, limb, that, replaces, an, arm, missing, below, the, elbow, upper, limb, prostheses, can, be, categorized, in, three, main, categories, passive, devices, body, powered, devices, and, externally, powered, myoelectric, devices, passive, devices, can, either, be, passive, hands, mainly, used, for, cosmetic, purposes, or, passive, tools, mainly, used, for, specific, activities, e, g, leisure, or, vocational, an, extensive, overview, and, classification, of, passive, devices, can, be, found, in, a, literature, review, by, maat, et, al, a, passive, device, can, be, static, meaning, the, device, has, no, movable, parts, or, it, can, be, adjustable, meaning, its, configuration, can, be, adjusted, e, g, adjustable, hand, opening, despite, the, absence, of, active, grasping, passive, devices, are, very, useful, in, bimanual, tasks, that, require, fixation, or, support, of, an, object, or, for, gesticulation, in, social, interaction, according, to, scientific, data, a, third, of, the, upper, limb, amputees, worldwide, use, a, passive, prosthetic, hand, body, powered, or, cable, operated, limbs, work, by, attaching, a, harness, and, cable, around, the, opposite, shoulder, of, the, damaged, arm, a, recent, body, powered, approach, has, explored, the, utilization, of, the, user, s, breathing, to, power, and, control, the, prosthetic, hand, to, help, eliminate, actuation, cable, and, harness, the, third, category, of, available, prosthetic, devices, comprises, myoelectric, arms, this, particular, class, of, devices, distinguishes, itself, from, the, previous, ones, due, to, the, inclusion, of, a, battery, system, this, battery, serves, the, dual, purpose, of, providing, energy, for, both, actuation, and, sensing, components, while, actuation, predominantly, relies, on, motor, or, pneumatic, systems, a, variety, of, solutions, have, been, explored, for, capturing, muscle, activity, including, techniques, such, as, electromyography, sonomyography, myokinetic, and, others, these, methods, function, by, detecting, the, minute, electrical, currents, generated, by, contracted, muscles, during, upper, arm, movement, typically, employing, electrodes, or, other, suitable, tools, subsequently, these, acquired, signals, are, converted, into, gripping, patterns, or, postures, that, the, artificial, hand, will, then, execute, in, the, prosthetics, industry, a, trans, radial, prosthetic, arm, is, often, referred, to, as, a, be, or, below, elbow, prosthesis, lower, extremity, prostheses, provide, replacements, at, varying, levels, of, amputation, these, include, hip, disarticulation, transfemoral, prosthesis, knee, disarticulation, transtibial, prosthesis, syme, s, amputation, foot, partial, foot, and, toe, the, two, main, subcategories, of, lower, extremity, prosthetic, devices, are, trans, tibial, any, amputation, transecting, the, tibia, bone, or, a, congenital, anomaly, resulting, in, a, tibial, deficiency, and, trans, femoral, any, amputation, transecting, the, femur, bone, or, a, congenital, anomaly, resulting, in, a, femoral, deficiency, a, transfemoral, prosthesis, is, an, artificial, limb, that, replaces, a, leg, missing, above, the, knee, transfemoral, amputees, can, have, a, very, difficult, time, regaining, normal, movement, in, general, a, transfemoral, amputee, must, use, approximately, 80, more, energy, to, walk, than, a, person, with, two, whole, legs, this, is, due, to, the, complexities, in, movement, associated, with, the, knee, in, newer, and, more, improved, designs, hydraulics, carbon, fiber, mechanical, linkages, motors, computer, microprocessors, and, innovative, combinations, of, these, technologies, are, employed, to, give, more, control, to, the, user, in, the, prosthetics, industry, a, trans, femoral, prosthetic, leg, is, often, referred, to, as, an, ak, or, above, the, knee, prosthesis, a, transtibial, prosthesis, is, an, artificial, limb, that, replaces, a, leg, missing, below, the, knee, a, transtibial, amputee, is, usually, able, to, regain, normal, movement, more, readily, than, someone, with, a, transfemoral, amputation, due, in, large, part, to, retaining, the, knee, which, allows, for, easier, movement, lower, extremity, prosthetics, describe, artificially, replaced, limbs, located, at, the, hip, level, or, lower, in, the, prosthetics, industry, a, trans, tibial, prosthetic, leg, is, often, referred, to, as, a, bk, or, below, the, knee, prosthesis, prostheses, are, manufactured, and, fit, by, clinical, prosthetists, prosthetists, are, healthcare, professionals, responsible, for, making, fitting, and, adjusting, prostheses, and, for, lower, limb, prostheses, will, assess, both, gait, and, prosthetic, alignment, once, a, prosthesis, has, been, fit, and, adjusted, by, a, prosthetist, a, rehabilitation, physiotherapist, called, physical, therapist, in, america, will, help, teach, a, new, prosthetic, user, to, walk, with, a, leg, prosthesis, to, do, so, the, physical, therapist, may, provide, verbal, instructions, and, may, also, help, guide, the, person, using, touch, or, tactile, cues, this, may, be, done, in, a, clinic, or, home, there, is, some, research, suggesting, that, such, training, in, the, home, may, be, more, successful, if, the, treatment, includes, the, use, of, a, treadmill, using, a, treadmill, along, with, the, physical, therapy, treatment, helps, the, person, to, experience, many, of, the, challenges, of, walking, with, a, prosthesis, in, the, united, kingdom, 75, of, lower, limb, amputations, are, performed, due, to, inadequate, circulation, dysvascularity, this, condition, is, often, associated, with, many, other, medical, conditions, co, morbidities, including, diabetes, and, heart, disease, that, may, make, it, a, challenge, to, recover, and, use, a, prosthetic, limb, to, regain, mobility, and, independence, for, people, who, have, inadequate, circulation, and, have, lost, a, lower, limb, there, is, insufficient, evidence, due, to, a, lack, of, research, to, inform, them, regarding, their, choice, of, prosthetic, rehabilitation, approaches, lower, extremity, prostheses, are, often, categorized, by, the, level, of, amputation, or, after, the, name, of, a, surgeon, prosthetic, are, made, lightweight, for, better, convenience, for, the, amputee, some, of, these, materials, include, wheeled, prostheses, have, also, been, used, extensively, in, the, rehabilitation, of, injured, domestic, animals, including, dogs, cats, pigs, rabbits, and, turtles, prosthetics, originate, from, the, ancient, near, east, circa, 3000, bce, with, the, earliest, evidence, of, prosthetics, appearing, in, ancient, egypt, and, iran, the, earliest, recorded, mention, of, eye, prosthetics, is, from, the, egyptian, story, of, the, eye, of, horus, dates, circa, 3000, bc, which, involves, the, left, eye, of, horus, being, plucked, out, and, then, restored, by, thoth, circa, 3000, 2800, bc, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, prosthetics, is, found, in, ancient, iran, where, an, eye, prosthetic, is, found, buried, with, a, woman, in, shahr, i, sh, khta, it, was, likely, made, of, bitumen, paste, that, was, covered, with, a, thin, layer, of, gold, the, egyptians, were, also, early, pioneers, of, foot, prosthetics, as, shown, by, the, wooden, toe, found, on, a, body, from, the, new, kingdom, circa, 1000, bc, another, early, textual, mention, is, found, in, south, asia, circa, 1200, bc, involving, the, warrior, queen, vishpala, in, the, rigveda, roman, bronze, crowns, have, also, been, found, but, their, use, could, have, been, more, aesthetic, than, medical, an, early, mention, of, a, prosthetic, comes, from, the, greek, historian, herodotus, who, tells, the, story, of, hegesistratus, a, greek, diviner, who, cut, off, his, own, foot, to, escape, his, spartan, captors, and, replaced, it, with, a, wooden, one, pliny, the, elder, also, recorded, the, tale, of, a, roman, general, marcus, sergius, whose, right, hand, was, cut, off, while, campaigning, and, had, an, iron, hand, made, to, hold, his, shield, so, that, he, could, return, to, battle, a, famous, and, quite, refined, historical, prosthetic, arm, was, that, of, g, tz, von, berlichingen, made, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, the, first, confirmed, use, of, a, prosthetic, device, however, is, from, 950, to, 710, bc, in, 2000, research, pathologists, discovered, a, mummy, from, this, period, buried, in, the, egyptian, necropolis, near, ancient, thebes, that, possessed, an, artificial, big, toe, this, toe, consisting, of, wood, and, leather, exhibited, evidence, of, use, when, reproduced, by, bio, mechanical, engineers, in, 2011, researchers, discovered, that, this, ancient, prosthetic, enabled, its, wearer, to, walk, both, barefoot, and, in, egyptian, style, sandals, previously, the, earliest, discovered, prosthetic, was, an, artificial, leg, from, capua, around, the, same, time, fran, ois, de, la, noue, is, also, reported, to, have, had, an, iron, hand, as, is, in, the, 17th, century, ren, robert, cavalier, de, la, salle, henri, de, tonti, had, a, prosthetic, hook, for, a, hand, during, the, middle, ages, prosthetics, remained, quite, basic, in, form, debilitated, knights, would, be, fitted, with, prosthetics, so, they, could, hold, up, a, shield, grasp, a, lance, or, a, sword, or, stabilize, a, mounted, warrior, only, the, wealthy, could, afford, anything, that, would, assist, in, daily, life, one, notable, prosthesis, was, that, belonging, to, an, italian, man, who, scientists, estimate, replaced, his, amputated, right, hand, with, a, knife, scientists, investigating, the, skeleton, which, was, found, in, a, longobard, cemetery, in, povegliano, veronese, estimated, that, the, man, had, lived, sometime, between, the, 6th, and, 8th, centuries, ad, materials, found, near, the, man, s, body, suggest, that, the, knife, prosthesis, was, attached, with, a, leather, strap, which, he, repeatedly, tightened, with, his, teeth, during, the, renaissance, prosthetics, developed, with, the, use, of, iron, steel, copper, and, wood, functional, prosthetics, began, to, make, an, appearance, in, the, 1500s, an, italian, surgeon, recorded, the, existence, of, an, amputee, who, had, an, arm, that, allowed, him, to, remove, his, hat, open, his, purse, and, sign, his, name, improvement, in, amputation, surgery, and, prosthetic, design, came, at, the, hands, of, ambroise, par, among, his, inventions, was, an, above, knee, device, that, was, a, kneeling, peg, leg, and, foot, prosthesis, with, a, fixed, position, adjustable, harness, and, knee, lock, control, the, functionality, of, his, advancements, showed, how, future, prosthetics, could, develop, other, major, improvements, before, the, modern, era, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, nas, national, academy, of, sciences, began, to, advocate, better, research, and, development, of, prosthetics, through, government, funding, a, research, and, development, program, was, developed, within, the, army, navy, air, force, and, the, veterans, administration, after, the, second, world, war, a, team, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, including, james, foort, and, c, w, radcliff, helped, to, develop, the, quadrilateral, socket, by, developing, a, jig, fitting, system, for, amputations, above, the, knee, socket, technology, for, lower, extremity, limbs, saw, a, further, revolution, during, the, 1980s, when, john, sabolich, c, p, o, invented, the, contoured, adducted, trochanteric, controlled, alignment, method, catcam, socket, later, to, evolve, into, the, sabolich, socket, he, followed, the, direction, of, ivan, long, and, ossur, christensen, as, they, developed, alternatives, to, the, quadrilateral, socket, which, in, turn, followed, the, open, ended, plug, socket, created, from, wood, the, advancement, was, due, to, the, difference, in, the, socket, to, patient, contact, model, prior, to, this, sockets, were, made, in, the, shape, of, a, square, shape, with, no, specialized, containment, for, muscular, tissue, new, designs, thus, help, to, lock, in, the, bony, anatomy, locking, it, into, place, and, distributing, the, weight, evenly, over, the, existing, limb, as, well, as, the, musculature, of, the, patient, ischial, containment, is, well, known, and, used, today, by, many, prosthetist, to, help, in, patient, care, variations, of, the, ischial, containment, socket, thus, exists, and, each, socket, is, tailored, to, the, specific, needs, of, the, patient, others, who, contributed, to, socket, development, and, changes, over, the, years, include, tim, staats, chris, hoyt, and, frank, gottschalk, gottschalk, disputed, the, efficacy, of, the, cat, cam, socket, insisting, the, surgical, procedure, done, by, the, amputation, surgeon, was, most, important, to, prepare, the, amputee, for, good, use, of, a, prosthesis, of, any, type, socket, design, the, first, microprocessor, controlled, prosthetic, knees, became, available, in, the, early, 1990s, the, intelligent, prosthesis, was, the, first, commercially, available, microprocessor, controlled, prosthetic, knee, it, was, released, by, chas, a, blatchford, sons, ltd, of, great, britain, in, 1993, and, made, walking, with, the, prosthesis, feel, and, look, more, natural, an, improved, version, was, released, in, 1995, by, the, name, intelligent, prosthesis, plus, blatchford, released, another, prosthesis, the, adaptive, prosthesis, in, 1998, the, adaptive, prosthesis, utilized, hydraulic, controls, pneumatic, controls, and, a, microprocessor, to, provide, the, amputee, with, a, gait, that, was, more, responsive, to, changes, in, walking, speed, cost, analysis, reveals, that, a, sophisticated, above, knee, prosthesis, will, be, about, 1, million, in, 45, years, given, only, annual, cost, of, living, adjustments, in, 2019, a, project, under, at2030, was, launched, in, which, bespoke, sockets, are, made, using, a, thermoplastic, rather, than, through, a, plaster, cast, this, is, faster, to, do, and, significantly, less, expensive, the, sockets, were, called, amparo, confidence, sockets, in, 2005, darpa, started, the, revolutionizing, prosthetics, program, according, to, darpa, the, goal, of, the, 100, million, program, was, to, develop, an, advanced, electromechanical, prosthetic, upper, limb, with, near, natural, control, that, would, dramatically, enhance, independence, and, quality, of, life, for, amputees, in, 2014, the, luke, arm, developed, by, dean, kamen, and, his, team, at, deka, research, and, development, corp, became, the, first, prosthetic, arm, approved, by, fda, that, translates, signals, from, a, person, s, muscles, to, perform, complex, tasks, according, to, fda, johns, hopkins, university, and, the, u, s, department, of, veteran, affairs, also, participated, in, the, program, there, are, many, steps, in, the, evolution, of, prosthetic, design, trends, that, are, moving, forward, with, time, many, design, trends, point, to, lighter, more, durable, and, flexible, materials, like, carbon, fiber, silicone, and, advanced, polymers, these, not, only, make, the, prosthetic, limb, lighter, and, more, durable, but, also, allow, it, to, mimic, the, look, and, feel, of, natural, skin, providing, users, with, a, more, comfortable, and, natural, experience, this, new, technology, helps, prosthetic, users, blend, in, with, people, with, normal, ligaments, to, reduce, the, stigmatism, for, people, who, wear, prosthetics, another, trend, points, towards, using, bionics, and, myoelectric, components, in, prosthetic, design, these, limbs, utilize, sensors, to, detect, electrical, signals, from, the, user, s, residual, muscles, the, signals, are, then, converted, into, motions, allowing, users, to, control, their, prosthetic, limbs, using, their, own, muscle, contractions, this, has, greatly, improved, the, range, and, fluidity, of, movements, available, to, amputees, making, tasks, like, grasping, objects, or, walking, naturally, much, more, feasible, integration, with, ai, is, also, on, the, forefront, to, the, prosthetic, design, ai, enabled, prosthetic, limbs, can, learn, and, adapt, to, the, user, s, habits, and, preferences, over, time, ensuring, optimal, functionality, by, analyzing, the, user, s, gait, grip, and, other, movements, these, smart, limbs, can, make, real, time, adjustments, providing, smoother, and, more, natural, motions, a, prosthesis, is, a, functional, replacement, for, an, amputated, or, congenitally, malformed, or, missing, limb, prosthetists, are, responsible, for, the, prescription, design, and, management, of, a, prosthetic, device, in, most, cases, the, prosthetist, begins, by, taking, a, plaster, cast, of, the, patient, s, affected, limb, lightweight, high, strength, thermoplastics, are, custom, formed, to, this, model, of, the, patient, cutting, edge, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, titanium, and, kevlar, provide, strength, and, durability, while, making, the, new, prosthesis, lighter, more, sophisticated, prostheses, are, equipped, with, advanced, electronics, providing, additional, stability, and, control, over, the, years, there, have, been, advancements, in, artificial, limbs, new, plastics, and, other, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, have, allowed, artificial, limbs, to, be, stronger, and, lighter, limiting, the, amount, of, extra, energy, necessary, to, operate, the, limb, this, is, especially, important, for, trans, femoral, amputees, additional, materials, have, allowed, artificial, limbs, to, look, much, more, realistic, which, is, important, to, trans, radial, and, transhumeral, amputees, because, they, are, more, likely, to, have, the, artificial, limb, exposed, in, addition, to, new, materials, the, use, of, electronics, has, become, very, common, in, artificial, limbs, myoelectric, limbs, which, control, the, limbs, by, converting, muscle, movements, to, electrical, signals, have, become, much, more, common, than, cable, operated, limbs, myoelectric, signals, are, picked, up, by, electrodes, the, signal, gets, integrated, and, once, it, exceeds, a, certain, threshold, the, prosthetic, limb, control, signal, is, triggered, which, is, why, inherently, all, myoelectric, controls, lag, conversely, cable, control, is, immediate, and, physical, and, through, that, offers, a, certain, degree, of, direct, force, feedback, that, myoelectric, control, does, not, computers, are, also, used, extensively, in, the, manufacturing, of, limbs, computer, aided, design, and, computer, aided, manufacturing, are, often, used, to, assist, in, the, design, and, manufacture, of, artificial, limbs, most, modern, artificial, limbs, are, attached, to, the, residual, limb, stump, of, the, amputee, by, belts, and, cuffs, or, by, suction, the, residual, limb, either, directly, fits, into, a, socket, on, the, prosthetic, or, more, commonly, today, a, liner, is, used, that, then, is, fixed, to, the, socket, either, by, vacuum, suction, sockets, or, a, pin, lock, liners, are, soft, and, by, that, they, can, create, a, far, better, suction, fit, than, hard, sockets, silicone, liners, can, be, obtained, in, standard, sizes, mostly, with, a, circular, round, cross, section, but, for, any, other, residual, limb, shape, custom, liners, can, be, made, the, socket, is, custom, made, to, fit, the, residual, limb, and, to, distribute, the, forces, of, the, artificial, limb, across, the, area, of, the, residual, limb, rather, than, just, one, small, spot, which, helps, reduce, wear, on, the, residual, limb, the, production, of, a, prosthetic, socket, begins, with, capturing, the, geometry, of, the, residual, limb, this, process, is, called, shape, capture, the, goal, of, this, process, is, to, create, an, accurate, representation, of, the, residual, limb, which, is, critical, to, achieve, good, socket, fit, the, custom, socket, is, created, by, taking, a, plaster, cast, of, the, residual, limb, or, more, commonly, today, of, the, liner, worn, over, their, residual, limb, and, then, making, a, mold, from, the, plaster, cast, the, commonly, used, compound, is, called, plaster, of, paris, in, recent, years, various, digital, shape, capture, systems, have, been, developed, which, can, be, input, directly, to, a, computer, allowing, for, a, more, sophisticated, design, in, general, the, shape, capturing, process, begins, with, the, digital, acquisition, of, three, dimensional, 3d, geometric, data, from, the, amputee, s, residual, limb, data, are, acquired, with, either, a, probe, laser, scanner, structured, light, scanner, or, a, photographic, based, 3d, scanning, system, after, shape, capture, the, second, phase, of, the, socket, production, is, called, rectification, which, is, the, process, of, modifying, the, model, of, the, residual, limb, by, adding, volume, to, bony, prominence, and, potential, pressure, points, and, remove, volume, from, load, bearing, area, this, can, be, done, manually, by, adding, or, removing, plaster, to, the, positive, model, or, virtually, by, manipulating, the, computerized, model, in, the, software, lastly, the, fabrication, of, the, prosthetic, socket, begins, once, the, model, has, been, rectified, and, finalized, the, prosthetists, would, wrap, the, positive, model, with, a, semi, molten, plastic, sheet, or, carbon, fiber, coated, with, epoxy, resin, to, construct, the, prosthetic, socket, for, the, computerized, model, it, can, be, 3d, printed, using, a, various, of, material, with, different, flexibility, and, mechanical, strength, optimal, socket, fit, between, the, residual, limb, and, socket, is, critical, to, the, function, and, usage, of, the, entire, prosthesis, if, the, fit, between, the, residual, limb, and, socket, attachment, is, too, loose, this, will, reduce, the, area, of, contact, between, the, residual, limb, and, socket, or, liner, and, increase, pockets, between, residual, limb, skin, and, socket, or, liner, pressure, then, is, higher, which, can, be, painful, air, pockets, can, allow, sweat, to, accumulate, that, can, soften, the, skin, ultimately, this, is, a, frequent, cause, for, itchy, skin, rashes, over, time, this, can, lead, to, breakdown, of, the, skin, on, the, other, hand, a, very, tight, fit, may, excessively, increase, the, interface, pressures, that, may, also, lead, to, skin, breakdown, after, prolonged, use, artificial, limbs, are, typically, manufactured, using, the, following, steps, current, technology, allows, body, powered, arms, to, weigh, around, one, half, to, one, third, of, what, a, myoelectric, arm, does, current, body, powered, arms, contain, sockets, that, are, built, from, hard, epoxy, or, carbon, fiber, these, sockets, or, interfaces, can, be, made, more, comfortable, by, lining, them, with, a, softer, compressible, foam, material, that, provides, padding, for, the, bone, prominences, a, self, suspending, or, supra, condylar, socket, design, is, useful, for, those, with, short, to, mid, range, below, elbow, absence, longer, limbs, may, require, the, use, of, a, locking, roll, on, type, inner, liner, or, more, complex, harnessing, to, help, augment, suspension, wrist, units, are, either, screw, on, connectors, featuring, the, unf, 1, 2, 20, thread, usa, or, quick, release, connector, of, which, there, are, different, models, two, types, of, body, powered, systems, exist, voluntary, opening, pull, to, open, and, voluntary, closing, pull, to, close, virtually, all, split, hook, prostheses, operate, with, a, voluntary, opening, type, system, more, modern, prehensors, called, grips, utilize, voluntary, closing, systems, the, differences, are, significant, users, of, voluntary, opening, systems, rely, on, elastic, bands, or, springs, for, gripping, force, while, users, of, voluntary, closing, systems, rely, on, their, own, body, power, and, energy, to, create, gripping, force, voluntary, closing, users, can, generate, prehension, forces, equivalent, to, the, normal, hand, up, to, or, exceeding, one, hundred, pounds, voluntary, closing, grips, require, constant, tension, to, grip, like, a, human, hand, and, in, that, property, they, do, come, closer, to, matching, human, hand, performance, voluntary, opening, split, hook, users, are, limited, to, forces, their, rubber, or, springs, can, generate, which, usually, is, below, 20, pounds, an, additional, difference, exists, in, the, biofeedback, created, that, allows, the, user, to, feel, what, is, being, held, voluntary, opening, systems, once, engaged, provide, the, holding, force, so, that, they, operate, like, a, passive, vice, at, the, end, of, the, arm, no, gripping, feedback, is, provided, once, the, hook, has, closed, around, the, object, being, held, voluntary, closing, systems, provide, directly, proportional, control, and, biofeedback, so, that, the, user, can, feel, how, much, force, that, they, are, applying, in, 1997, the, colombian, prof, lvaro, r, os, poveda, a, researcher, in, bionics, in, latin, america, developed, an, upper, limb, and, hand, prosthesis, with, sensory, feedback, this, technology, allows, amputee, patients, to, handle, prosthetic, hand, systems, in, a, more, natural, way, a, recent, study, showed, that, by, stimulating, the, median, and, ulnar, nerves, according, to, the, information, provided, by, the, artificial, sensors, from, a, hand, prosthesis, physiologically, appropriate, near, natural, sensory, information, could, be, provided, to, an, amputee, this, feedback, enabled, the, participant, to, effectively, modulate, the, grasping, force, of, the, prosthesis, with, no, visual, or, auditory, feedback, in, february, 2013, researchers, from, cole, polytechnique, f, d, rale, de, lausanne, in, switzerland, and, the, scuola, superiore, sant, anna, in, italy, implanted, electrodes, into, an, amputee, s, arm, which, gave, the, patient, sensory, feedback, and, allowed, for, real, time, control, of, the, prosthetic, with, wires, linked, to, nerves, in, his, upper, arm, the, danish, patient, was, able, to, handle, objects, and, instantly, receive, a, sense, of, touch, through, the, special, artificial, hand, that, was, created, by, silvestro, micera, and, researchers, both, in, switzerland, and, italy, in, july, 2019, this, technology, was, expanded, on, even, further, by, researchers, from, the, university, of, utah, led, by, jacob, george, the, group, of, researchers, implanted, electrodes, into, the, patient, s, arm, to, map, out, several, sensory, precepts, they, would, then, stimulate, each, electrode, to, figure, out, how, each, sensory, precept, was, triggered, then, proceed, to, map, the, sensory, information, onto, the, prosthetic, this, would, allow, the, researchers, to, get, a, good, approximation, of, the, same, kind, of, information, that, the, patient, would, receive, from, their, natural, hand, unfortunately, the, arm, is, too, expensive, for, the, average, user, to, acquire, however, jacob, mentioned, that, insurance, companies, could, cover, the, costs, of, the, prosthetic, terminal, devices, contain, a, range, of, hooks, prehensors, hands, or, other, devices, voluntary, opening, split, hook, systems, are, simple, convenient, light, robust, versatile, and, relatively, affordable, a, hook, does, not, match, a, normal, human, hand, for, appearance, or, overall, versatility, but, its, material, tolerances, can, exceed, and, surpass, the, normal, human, hand, for, mechanical, stress, one, can, even, use, a, hook, to, slice, open, boxes, or, as, a, hammer, whereas, the, same, is, not, possible, with, a, normal, hand, for, thermal, stability, one, can, use, a, hook, to, grip, items, from, boiling, water, to, turn, meat, on, a, grill, to, hold, a, match, until, it, has, burned, down, completely, and, for, chemical, hazards, as, a, metal, hook, withstands, acids, or, lye, and, does, not, react, to, solvents, like, a, prosthetic, glove, or, human, skin, prosthetic, hands, are, available, in, both, voluntary, opening, and, voluntary, closing, versions, and, because, of, their, more, complex, mechanics, and, cosmetic, glove, covering, require, a, relatively, large, activation, force, which, depending, on, the, type, of, harness, used, may, be, uncomfortable, a, recent, study, by, the, delft, university, of, technology, the, netherlands, showed, that, the, development, of, mechanical, prosthetic, hands, has, been, neglected, during, the, past, decades, the, study, showed, that, the, pinch, force, level, of, most, current, mechanical, hands, is, too, low, for, practical, use, the, best, tested, hand, was, a, prosthetic, hand, developed, around, 1945, in, 2017, however, a, research, has, been, started, with, bionic, hands, by, laura, hruby, of, the, medical, university, of, vienna, a, few, open, hardware, 3, d, printable, bionic, hands, have, also, become, available, some, companies, are, also, producing, robotic, hands, with, integrated, forearm, for, fitting, unto, a, patient, s, upper, arm, and, in, 2020, at, the, italian, institute, of, technology, iit, another, robotic, hand, with, integrated, forearm, soft, hand, pro, was, developed, hosmer, and, otto, bock, are, major, commercial, hook, providers, mechanical, hands, are, sold, by, hosmer, and, otto, bock, as, well, the, becker, hand, is, still, manufactured, by, the, becker, family, prosthetic, hands, may, be, fitted, with, standard, stock, or, custom, made, cosmetic, looking, silicone, gloves, but, regular, work, gloves, may, be, worn, as, well, other, terminal, devices, include, the, v2p, prehensor, a, versatile, robust, gripper, that, allows, customers, to, modify, aspects, of, it, texas, assist, devices, with, a, whole, assortment, of, tools, and, trs, that, offers, a, range, of, terminal, devices, for, sports, cable, harnesses, can, be, built, using, aircraft, steel, cables, ball, hinges, and, self, lubricating, cable, sheaths, some, prosthetics, have, been, designed, specifically, for, use, in, salt, water, lower, extremity, prosthetics, describes, artificially, replaced, limbs, located, at, the, hip, level, or, lower, concerning, all, ages, ephraim, et, al, 2003, found, a, worldwide, estimate, of, all, cause, lower, extremity, amputations, of, 2, 0, 5, 9, per, 10, 000, inhabitants, for, birth, prevalence, rates, of, congenital, limb, deficiency, they, found, an, estimate, between, 3, 5, and, 7, 1, cases, per, 10, 000, births, the, two, main, subcategories, of, lower, extremity, prosthetic, devices, are, trans, tibial, any, amputation, transecting, the, tibia, bone, or, a, congenital, anomaly, resulting, in, a, tibial, deficiency, and, trans, femoral, any, amputation, transecting, the, femur, bone, or, a, congenital, anomaly, resulting, in, a, femoral, deficiency, in, the, prosthetic, industry, a, trans, tibial, prosthetic, leg, is, often, referred, to, as, a, bk, or, below, the, knee, prosthesis, while, the, trans, femoral, prosthetic, leg, is, often, referred, to, as, an, ak, or, above, the, knee, prosthesis, other, less, prevalent, lower, extremity, cases, include, the, following, the, socket, serves, as, an, interface, between, the, residuum, and, the, prosthesis, ideally, allowing, comfortable, weight, bearing, movement, control, and, proprioception, socket, problems, such, as, discomfort, and, skin, breakdown, are, rated, among, the, most, important, issues, faced, by, lower, limb, amputees, this, part, creates, distance, and, support, between, the, knee, joint, and, the, foot, in, case, of, an, upper, leg, prosthesis, or, between, the, socket, and, the, foot, the, type, of, connectors, that, are, used, between, the, shank, and, the, knee, foot, determines, whether, the, prosthesis, is, modular, or, not, modular, means, that, the, angle, and, the, displacement, of, the, foot, in, respect, to, the, socket, can, be, changed, after, fitting, in, developing, countries, prosthesis, mostly, are, non, modular, in, order, to, reduce, cost, when, considering, children, modularity, of, angle, and, height, is, important, because, of, their, average, growth, of, 1, 9, cm, annually, providing, contact, to, the, ground, the, foot, provides, shock, absorption, and, stability, during, stance, additionally, it, influences, gait, biomechanics, by, its, shape, and, stiffness, this, is, because, the, trajectory, of, the, center, of, pressure, cop, and, the, angle, of, the, ground, reaction, forces, is, determined, by, the, shape, and, stiffness, of, the, foot, and, needs, to, match, the, subject, s, build, in, order, to, produce, a, normal, gait, pattern, andrysek, 2010, found, 16, different, types, of, feet, with, greatly, varying, results, concerning, durability, and, biomechanics, the, main, problem, found, in, current, feet, is, durability, endurance, ranging, from, 16, to, 32, months, these, results, are, for, adults, and, will, probably, be, worse, for, children, due, to, higher, activity, levels, and, scale, effects, evidence, comparing, different, types, of, feet, and, ankle, prosthetic, devices, is, not, strong, enough, to, determine, if, one, mechanism, of, ankle, foot, is, superior, to, another, when, deciding, on, a, device, the, cost, of, the, device, a, person, s, functional, need, and, the, availability, of, a, particular, device, should, be, considered, in, case, of, a, trans, femoral, above, knee, amputation, there, also, is, a, need, for, a, complex, connector, providing, articulation, allowing, flexion, during, swing, phase, but, not, during, stance, as, its, purpose, is, to, replace, the, knee, the, prosthetic, knee, joint, is, the, most, critical, component, of, the, prosthesis, for, trans, femoral, amputees, the, function, of, the, good, prosthetic, knee, joint, is, to, mimic, the, function, of, the, normal, knee, such, as, providing, structural, support, and, stability, during, stance, phase, but, able, to, flex, in, a, controllable, manner, during, swing, phase, hence, it, allows, users, to, have, a, smooth, and, energy, efficient, gait, and, minimize, the, impact, of, amputation, the, prosthetic, knee, is, connected, to, the, prosthetic, foot, by, the, shank, which, is, usually, made, of, an, aluminum, or, graphite, tube, one, of, the, most, important, aspect, of, a, prosthetic, knee, joint, would, be, its, stance, phase, control, mechanism, the, function, of, stance, phase, control, is, to, prevent, the, leg, from, buckling, when, the, limb, is, loaded, during, weight, acceptance, this, ensures, the, stability, of, the, knee, in, order, to, support, the, single, limb, support, task, of, stance, phase, and, provides, a, smooth, transition, to, the, swing, phase, stance, phase, control, can, be, achieved, in, several, ways, including, the, mechanical, locks, relative, alignment, of, prosthetic, components, weight, activated, friction, control, and, polycentric, mechanisms, to, mimic, the, knee, s, functionality, during, gait, microprocessor, controlled, knee, joints, have, been, developed, that, control, the, flexion, of, the, knee, some, examples, are, otto, bock, s, c, leg, introduced, in, 1997, ossur, s, rheo, knee, released, in, 2005, the, power, knee, by, ossur, introduced, in, 2006, the, pli, knee, from, freedom, innovations, and, daw, industries, self, learning, knee, slk, the, idea, was, originally, developed, by, kelly, james, a, canadian, engineer, at, the, university, of, alberta, a, microprocessor, is, used, to, interpret, and, analyze, signals, from, knee, angle, sensors, and, moment, sensors, the, microprocessor, receives, signals, from, its, sensors, to, determine, the, type, of, motion, being, employed, by, the, amputee, most, microprocessor, controlled, knee, joints, are, powered, by, a, battery, housed, inside, the, prosthesis, the, sensory, signals, computed, by, the, microprocessor, are, used, to, control, the, resistance, generated, by, hydraulic, cylinders, in, the, knee, joint, small, valves, control, the, amount, of, hydraulic, fluid, that, can, pass, into, and, out, of, the, cylinder, thus, regulating, the, extension, and, compression, of, a, piston, connected, to, the, upper, section, of, the, knee, the, main, advantage, of, a, microprocessor, controlled, prosthesis, is, a, closer, approximation, to, an, amputee, s, natural, gait, some, allow, amputees, to, walk, near, walking, speed, or, run, variations, in, speed, are, also, possible, and, are, taken, into, account, by, sensors, and, communicated, to, the, microprocessor, which, adjusts, to, these, changes, accordingly, it, also, enables, the, amputees, to, walk, downstairs, with, a, step, over, step, approach, rather, than, the, one, step, at, a, time, approach, used, with, mechanical, knees, there, is, some, research, suggesting, that, people, with, microprocessor, controlled, prostheses, report, greater, satisfaction, and, improvement, in, functionality, residual, limb, health, and, safety, people, may, be, able, to, perform, everyday, activities, at, greater, speeds, even, while, multitasking, and, reduce, their, risk, of, falls, however, some, have, some, significant, drawbacks, that, impair, its, use, they, can, be, susceptible, to, water, damage, and, thus, great, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, that, the, prosthesis, remains, dry, a, myoelectric, prosthesis, uses, the, electrical, tension, generated, every, time, a, muscle, contracts, as, information, this, tension, can, be, captured, from, voluntarily, contracted, muscles, by, electrodes, applied, on, the, skin, to, control, the, movements, of, the, prosthesis, such, as, elbow, flexion, extension, wrist, supination, pronation, rotation, or, opening, closing, of, the, fingers, a, prosthesis, of, this, type, utilizes, the, residual, neuromuscular, system, of, the, human, body, to, control, the, functions, of, an, electric, powered, prosthetic, hand, wrist, elbow, or, foot, this, is, different, from, an, electric, switch, prosthesis, which, requires, straps, and, or, cables, actuated, by, body, movements, to, actuate, or, operate, switches, that, control, the, movements, of, the, prosthesis, there, is, no, clear, evidence, concluding, that, myoelectric, upper, extremity, prostheses, function, better, than, body, powered, prostheses, advantages, to, using, a, myoelectric, upper, extremity, prosthesis, include, the, potential, for, improvement, in, cosmetic, appeal, this, type, of, prosthesis, may, have, a, more, natural, look, may, be, better, for, light, everyday, activities, and, may, be, beneficial, for, people, experiencing, phantom, limb, pain, when, compared, to, a, body, powered, prosthesis, a, myoelectric, prosthesis, may, not, be, as, durable, may, have, a, longer, training, time, may, require, more, adjustments, may, need, more, maintenance, and, does, not, provide, feedback, to, the, user, prof, alvaro, r, os, poveda, has, been, working, for, several, years, on, a, non, invasive, and, affordable, solution, to, this, feedback, problem, he, considers, that, prosthetic, limbs, that, can, be, controlled, with, thought, hold, great, promise, for, the, amputee, but, without, sensorial, feedback, from, the, signals, returning, to, the, brain, it, can, be, difficult, to, achieve, the, level, of, control, necessary, to, perform, precise, movements, when, connecting, the, sense, of, touch, from, a, mechanical, hand, directly, to, the, brain, prosthetics, can, restore, the, function, of, the, amputated, limb, in, an, almost, natural, feeling, way, he, presented, the, first, myoelectric, prosthetic, hand, with, sensory, feedback, at, the, xviii, world, congress, on, medical, physics, and, biomedical, engineering, 1997, held, in, nice, france, the, ussr, was, the, first, to, develop, a, myoelectric, arm, in, 1958, while, the, first, myoelectric, arm, became, commercial, in, 1964, by, the, central, prosthetic, research, institute, of, the, ussr, and, distributed, by, the, hangar, limb, factory, of, the, uk, the, myoelectric, prosthesis, are, expensive, requires, regular, maintenance, sensitive, to, sweat, and, moisture, affecting, sensor, performance, robots, can, be, used, to, generate, objective, measures, of, patient, s, impairment, and, therapy, outcome, assist, in, diagnosis, customize, therapies, based, on, patient, s, motor, abilities, and, assure, compliance, with, treatment, regimens, and, maintain, patient, s, records, it, is, shown, in, many, studies, that, there, is, a, significant, improvement, in, upper, limb, motor, function, after, stroke, using, robotics, for, upper, limb, rehabilitation, in, order, for, a, robotic, prosthetic, limb, to, work, it, must, have, several, components, to, integrate, it, into, the, body, s, function, biosensors, detect, signals, from, the, user, s, nervous, or, muscular, systems, it, then, relays, this, information, to, a, microcontroller, located, inside, the, device, and, processes, feedback, from, the, limb, and, actuator, e, g, position, or, force, and, sends, it, to, the, controller, examples, include, surface, electrodes, that, detect, electrical, activity, on, the, skin, needle, electrodes, implanted, in, muscle, or, solid, state, electrode, arrays, with, nerves, growing, through, them, one, type, of, these, biosensors, are, employed, in, myoelectric, prostheses, a, device, known, as, the, controller, is, connected, to, the, user, s, nerve, and, muscular, systems, and, the, device, itself, it, sends, intention, commands, from, the, user, to, the, actuators, of, the, device, and, interprets, feedback, from, the, mechanical, and, biosensors, to, the, user, the, controller, is, also, responsible, for, the, monitoring, and, control, of, the, movements, of, the, device, an, actuator, mimics, the, actions, of, a, muscle, in, producing, force, and, movement, examples, include, a, motor, that, aids, or, replaces, original, muscle, tissue, targeted, muscle, reinnervation, tmr, is, a, technique, in, which, motor, nerves, which, previously, controlled, muscles, on, an, amputated, limb, are, surgically, rerouted, such, that, they, reinnervate, a, small, region, of, a, large, intact, muscle, such, as, the, pectoralis, major, as, a, result, when, a, patient, thinks, about, moving, the, thumb, of, their, missing, hand, a, small, area, of, muscle, on, their, chest, will, contract, instead, by, placing, sensors, over, the, reinnervated, muscle, these, contractions, can, be, made, to, control, the, movement, of, an, appropriate, part, of, the, robotic, prosthesis, a, variant, of, this, technique, is, called, targeted, sensory, reinnervation, tsr, this, procedure, is, similar, to, tmr, except, that, sensory, nerves, are, surgically, rerouted, to, skin, on, the, chest, rather, than, motor, nerves, rerouted, to, muscle, recently, robotic, limbs, have, improved, in, their, ability, to, take, signals, from, the, human, brain, and, translate, those, signals, into, motion, in, the, artificial, limb, darpa, the, pentagon, s, research, division, is, working, to, make, even, more, advancements, in, this, area, their, desire, is, to, create, an, artificial, limb, that, ties, directly, into, the, nervous, system, advancements, in, the, processors, used, in, myoelectric, arms, have, allowed, developers, to, make, gains, in, fine, tuned, control, of, the, prosthetic, the, boston, digital, arm, is, a, recent, artificial, limb, that, has, taken, advantage, of, these, more, advanced, processors, the, arm, allows, movement, in, five, axes, and, allows, the, arm, to, be, programmed, for, a, more, customized, feel, recently, the, i, limb, hand, invented, in, edinburgh, scotland, by, david, gow, has, become, the, first, commercially, available, hand, prosthesis, with, five, individually, powered, digits, the, hand, also, possesses, a, manually, rotatable, thumb, which, is, operated, passively, by, the, user, and, allows, the, hand, to, grip, in, precision, power, and, key, grip, modes, another, neural, prosthetic, is, johns, hopkins, university, applied, physics, laboratory, proto, 1, besides, the, proto, 1, the, university, also, finished, the, proto, 2, in, 2010, early, in, 2013, max, ortiz, catalan, and, rickard, br, nemark, of, the, chalmers, university, of, technology, and, sahlgrenska, university, hospital, in, sweden, succeeded, in, making, the, first, robotic, arm, which, is, mind, controlled, and, can, be, permanently, attached, to, the, body, using, osseointegration, an, approach, that, is, very, useful, is, called, arm, rotation, which, is, common, for, unilateral, amputees, which, is, an, amputation, that, affects, only, one, side, of, the, body, and, also, essential, for, bilateral, amputees, a, person, who, is, missing, or, has, had, amputated, either, both, arms, or, legs, to, carry, out, activities, of, daily, living, this, involves, inserting, a, small, permanent, magnet, into, the, distal, end, of, the, residual, bone, of, subjects, with, upper, limb, amputations, when, a, subject, rotates, the, residual, arm, the, magnet, will, rotate, with, the, residual, bone, causing, a, change, in, magnetic, field, distribution, eeg, electroencephalogram, signals, detected, using, small, flat, metal, discs, attached, to, the, scalp, essentially, decoding, human, brain, activity, used, for, physical, movement, is, used, to, control, the, robotic, limbs, this, allows, the, user, to, control, the, part, directly, the, research, of, robotic, legs, has, made, some, advancement, over, time, allowing, exact, movement, and, control, researchers, at, the, rehabilitation, institute, of, chicago, announced, in, september, 2013, that, they, have, developed, a, robotic, leg, that, translates, neural, impulses, from, the, user, s, thigh, muscles, into, movement, which, is, the, first, prosthetic, leg, to, do, so, it, is, currently, in, testing, hugh, herr, head, of, the, biomechatronics, group, at, mit, s, media, lab, developed, a, robotic, transtibial, leg, powerfoot, biom, the, icelandic, company, ssur, has, also, created, a, robotic, transtibial, leg, with, motorized, ankle, that, moves, through, algorithms, and, sensors, that, automatically, adjust, the, angle, of, the, foot, during, different, points, in, its, wearer, s, stride, also, there, are, brain, controlled, bionic, legs, that, allow, an, individual, to, move, his, limbs, with, a, wireless, transmitter, the, main, goal, of, a, robotic, prosthesis, is, to, provide, active, actuation, during, gait, to, improve, the, biomechanics, of, gait, including, among, other, things, stability, symmetry, or, energy, expenditure, for, amputees, there, are, several, powered, prosthetic, legs, currently, on, the, market, including, fully, powered, legs, in, which, actuators, directly, drive, the, joints, and, semi, active, legs, which, use, small, amounts, of, energy, and, a, small, actuator, to, change, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, leg, but, do, not, inject, net, positive, energy, into, gait, specific, examples, include, the, empower, from, bionx, the, proprio, foot, from, ossur, and, the, elan, foot, from, endolite, various, research, groups, have, also, experimented, with, robotic, legs, over, the, last, decade, central, issues, being, researched, include, designing, the, behavior, of, the, device, during, stance, and, swing, phases, recognizing, the, current, ambulation, task, and, various, mechanical, design, problems, such, as, robustness, weight, battery, life, efficiency, and, noise, level, however, scientists, from, stanford, university, and, seoul, national, university, has, developed, artificial, nerves, system, that, will, help, prosthetic, limbs, feel, this, synthetic, nerve, system, enables, prosthetic, limbs, sense, braille, feel, the, sense, of, touch, and, respond, to, the, environment, prosthetics, are, being, made, from, recycled, plastic, bottles, and, lids, around, the, world, most, prostheses, are, attached, to, the, exterior, of, the, body, in, a, non, permanent, way, the, stump, and, socket, method, can, cause, significant, pain, in, the, amputee, which, is, why, the, direct, bone, attachment, has, been, explored, extensively, osseointegration, is, a, method, of, attaching, the, artificial, limb, to, the, body, by, a, prosthetic, implant, this, method, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, exoprosthesis, attaching, an, artificial, limb, to, the, bone, or, endo, exoprosthesis, endoprosthesis, are, prosthetic, joint, implants, which, remain, wholly, inside, the, body, such, as, knee, and, hip, replacement, implants, the, method, works, by, inserting, a, titanium, bolt, into, the, bone, at, the, end, of, the, stump, after, several, months, the, bone, attaches, itself, to, the, titanium, bolt, and, an, abutment, is, attached, to, the, titanium, bolt, the, abutment, extends, out, of, the, stump, and, the, removable, artificial, limb, is, then, attached, to, the, abutment, some, of, the, benefits, of, this, method, include, the, following, the, main, disadvantage, of, this, method, is, that, amputees, with, the, direct, bone, attachment, cannot, have, large, impacts, on, the, limb, such, as, those, experienced, during, jogging, because, of, the, potential, for, the, bone, to, break, cosmetic, prosthesis, has, long, been, used, to, disguise, injuries, and, disfigurements, with, advances, in, modern, technology, cosmesis, the, creation, of, lifelike, limbs, made, from, silicone, or, pvc, has, been, made, possible, such, prosthetics, including, artificial, hands, can, now, be, designed, to, simulate, the, appearance, of, real, hands, complete, with, freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints, and, even, tattoos, custom, made, cosmeses, are, generally, more, expensive, costing, thousands, of, u, s, dollars, depending, on, the, level, of, detail, while, standard, cosmeses, come, premade, in, a, variety, of, sizes, although, they, are, often, not, as, realistic, as, their, custom, made, counterparts, another, option, is, the, custom, made, silicone, cover, which, can, be, made, to, match, a, person, s, skin, tone, but, not, details, such, as, freckles, or, wrinkles, cosmeses, are, attached, to, the, body, in, any, number, of, ways, using, an, adhesive, suction, form, fitting, stretchable, skin, or, a, skin, sleeve, unlike, neuromotor, prostheses, neurocognitive, prostheses, would, sense, or, modulate, neural, function, in, order, to, physically, reconstitute, or, augment, cognitive, processes, such, as, executive, function, attention, language, and, memory, no, neurocognitive, prostheses, are, currently, available, but, the, development, of, implantable, neurocognitive, brain, computer, interfaces, has, been, proposed, to, help, treat, conditions, such, as, stroke, traumatic, brain, injury, cerebral, palsy, autism, and, alzheimer, s, disease, the, recent, field, of, assistive, technology, for, cognition, concerns, the, development, of, technologies, to, augment, human, cognition, scheduling, devices, such, as, neuropage, remind, users, with, memory, impairments, when, to, perform, certain, activities, such, as, visiting, the, doctor, micro, prompting, devices, such, as, peat, ablelink, and, guide, have, been, used, to, aid, users, with, memory, and, executive, function, problems, perform, activities, of, daily, living, in, addition, to, the, standard, artificial, limb, for, everyday, use, many, amputees, or, congenital, patients, have, special, limbs, and, devices, to, aid, in, the, participation, of, sports, and, recreational, activities, within, science, fiction, and, more, recently, within, the, scientific, community, there, has, been, consideration, given, to, using, advanced, prostheses, to, replace, healthy, body, parts, with, artificial, mechanisms, and, systems, to, improve, function, the, morality, and, desirability, of, such, technologies, are, being, debated, by, transhumanists, other, ethicists, and, others, in, general, body, parts, such, as, legs, arms, hands, feet, and, others, can, be, replaced, the, first, experiment, with, a, healthy, individual, appears, to, have, been, that, by, the, british, scientist, kevin, warwick, in, 2002, an, implant, was, interfaced, directly, into, warwick, s, nervous, system, the, electrode, array, which, contained, around, a, hundred, electrodes, was, placed, in, the, median, nerve, the, signals, produced, were, detailed, enough, that, a, robot, arm, was, able, to, mimic, the, actions, of, warwick, s, own, arm, and, provide, a, form, of, touch, feedback, again, via, the, implant, the, deka, company, of, dean, kamen, developed, the, luke, arm, an, advanced, nerve, controlled, prosthetic, clinical, trials, began, in, 2008, with, fda, approval, in, 2014, and, commercial, manufacturing, by, the, universal, instruments, corporation, expected, in, 2017, the, price, offered, at, retail, by, mobius, bionics, is, expected, to, be, around, 100, 000, further, research, in, april, 2019, there, have, been, improvements, towards, prosthetic, function, and, comfort, of, 3d, printed, personalized, wearable, systems, instead, of, manual, integration, after, printing, integrating, electronic, sensors, at, the, intersection, between, a, prosthetic, and, the, wearer, s, tissue, can, gather, information, such, as, pressure, across, wearer, s, tissue, that, can, help, improve, further, iteration, of, these, types, of, prosthetic, in, early, 2008, oscar, pistorius, the, blade, runner, of, south, africa, was, briefly, ruled, ineligible, to, compete, in, the, 2008, summer, olympics, because, his, transtibial, prosthesis, limbs, were, said, to, give, him, an, unfair, advantage, over, runners, who, had, ankles, one, researcher, found, that, his, limbs, used, twenty, five, percent, less, energy, than, those, of, a, non, disabled, runner, moving, at, the, same, speed, this, ruling, was, overturned, on, appeal, with, the, appellate, court, stating, that, the, overall, set, of, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, pistorius, limbs, had, not, been, considered, pistorius, did, not, qualify, for, the, south, african, team, for, the, olympics, but, went, on, to, sweep, the, 2008, summer, paralympics, and, has, been, ruled, eligible, to, qualify, for, any, future, olympics, he, qualified, for, the, 2011, world, championship, in, south, korea, and, reached, the, semi, final, where, he, ended, last, timewise, he, was, 14th, in, the, first, round, his, personal, best, at, 400m, would, have, given, him, 5th, place, in, the, finals, at, the, 2012, summer, olympics, in, london, pistorius, became, the, first, amputee, runner, to, compete, at, an, olympic, games, he, ran, in, the, 400, metres, race, semi, finals, and, the, 4, 400, metres, relay, race, finals, he, also, competed, in, 5, events, in, the, 2012, summer, paralympics, in, london, there, are, multiple, factors, to, consider, when, designing, a, transtibial, prosthesis, manufacturers, must, make, choices, about, their, priorities, regarding, these, factors, nonetheless, there, are, certain, elements, of, socket, and, foot, mechanics, that, are, invaluable, for, the, athlete, and, these, are, the, focus, of, today, s, high, tech, prosthetics, companies, the, buyer, is, also, concerned, with, numerous, other, factors, a, key, feature, of, prosthetics, and, prosthetic, design, is, the, idea, of, designing, for, disabilities, this, might, sound, like, a, good, idea, in, which, people, with, disabilities, can, participate, in, equitable, design, but, this, is, unfortunately, not, true, the, idea, of, designing, for, disabilities, is, first, problematic, because, of, the, underlying, meaning, of, disabilities, it, tells, amputees, that, there, is, a, right, and, wrong, way, to, move, and, walk, and, that, if, amputees, are, adapted, to, the, surrounding, environment, by, their, own, means, then, that, is, the, wrong, way, along, with, that, underlying, meaning, of, disabilities, many, people, designing, for, disabilities, are, not, actually, disabled, design, for, disability, from, these, experiences, takes, disability, as, the, object, with, the, feeling, from, non, disabled, designers, that, they, have, properly, learned, about, their, job, from, their, own, simulation, of, the, experience, the, simulation, is, misleading, and, does, a, disservice, to, disabled, people, so, the, design, that, flows, from, this, is, highly, problematic, engaging, in, disability, design, should, be, with, ideally, team, members, who, have, the, relevant, disability, and, are, part, of, communities, that, matter, to, the, research, this, leads, to, people, who, do, not, know, what, the, day, to, day, personal, experiences, are, designing, materials, that, do, not, meet, the, needs, or, hinder, the, needs, of, people, with, actual, disabilities, in, the, usa, a, typical, prosthetic, limb, costs, anywhere, between, 15, 000, and, 90, 000, depending, on, the, type, of, limb, desired, by, the, patient, with, medical, insurance, a, patient, will, typically, pay, 10, 50, of, the, total, cost, of, a, prosthetic, limb, while, the, insurance, company, will, cover, the, rest, of, the, cost, the, percent, that, the, patient, pays, varies, on, the, type, of, insurance, plan, as, well, as, the, limb, requested, by, the, patient, in, the, united, kingdom, much, of, europe, australia, and, new, zealand, the, entire, cost, of, prosthetic, limbs, is, met, by, state, funding, or, statutory, insurance, for, example, in, australia, prostheses, are, fully, funded, by, state, schemes, in, the, case, of, amputation, due, to, disease, and, by, workers, compensation, or, traffic, injury, insurance, in, the, case, of, most, traumatic, amputations, the, national, disability, insurance, scheme, which, is, being, rolled, out, nationally, between, 2017, and, 2020, also, pays, for, prostheses, transradial, below, the, elbow, amputation, and, transtibial, prostheses, below, the, knee, amputation, typically, cost, between, us, 6, 000, and, 8, 000, while, transfemoral, above, the, knee, amputation, and, transhumeral, prosthetics, above, the, elbow, amputation, cost, approximately, twice, as, much, with, a, range, of, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, and, can, sometimes, reach, costs, of, 35, 000, the, cost, of, an, artificial, limb, often, recurs, while, a, limb, typically, needs, to, be, replaced, every, 3, 4, years, due, to, wear, and, tear, of, everyday, use, in, addition, if, the, socket, has, fit, issues, the, socket, must, be, replaced, within, several, months, from, the, onset, of, pain, if, height, is, an, issue, components, such, as, pylons, can, be, changed, not, only, does, the, patient, need, to, pay, for, their, multiple, prosthetic, limbs, but, they, also, need, to, pay, for, physical, and, occupational, therapy, that, come, along, with, adapting, to, living, with, an, artificial, limb, unlike, the, reoccurring, cost, of, the, prosthetic, limbs, the, patient, will, typically, only, pay, the, 2000, to, 5000, for, therapy, during, the, first, year, or, two, of, living, as, an, amputee, once, the, patient, is, strong, and, comfortable, with, their, new, limb, they, will, not, be, required, to, go, to, therapy, anymore, throughout, one, s, life, it, is, projected, that, a, typical, amputee, will, go, through, 1, 4, million, worth, of, treatment, including, surgeries, prosthetics, as, well, as, therapies, low, cost, above, knee, prostheses, often, provide, only, basic, structural, support, with, limited, function, this, function, is, often, achieved, with, crude, non, articulating, unstable, or, manually, locking, knee, joints, a, limited, number, of, organizations, such, as, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, icrc, create, devices, for, developing, countries, their, device, which, is, manufactured, by, cr, equipments, is, a, single, axis, manually, operated, locking, polymer, prosthetic, knee, joint, table, list, of, knee, joint, technologies, based, on, the, literature, review, evidence, a, plan, for, a, low, cost, artificial, leg, designed, by, s, bastien, dubois, was, featured, at, the, 2007, international, design, exhibition, and, award, show, in, copenhagen, denmark, where, it, won, the, index, award, it, would, be, able, to, create, an, energy, return, prosthetic, leg, for, us, 8, 00, composed, primarily, of, fiberglass, prior, to, the, 1980s, foot, prostheses, merely, restored, basic, walking, capabilities, these, early, devices, can, be, characterized, by, a, simple, artificial, attachment, connecting, one, s, residual, limb, to, the, ground, the, introduction, of, the, seattle, foot, seattle, limb, systems, in, 1981, revolutionized, the, field, bringing, the, concept, of, an, energy, storing, prosthetic, foot, espf, to, the, fore, other, companies, soon, followed, suit, and, before, long, there, were, multiple, models, of, energy, storing, prostheses, on, the, market, each, model, utilized, some, variation, of, a, compressible, heel, the, heel, is, compressed, during, initial, ground, contact, storing, energy, which, is, then, returned, during, the, latter, phase, of, ground, contact, to, help, propel, the, body, forward, since, then, the, foot, prosthetics, industry, has, been, dominated, by, steady, small, improvements, in, performance, comfort, and, marketability, with, 3d, printers, it, is, possible, to, manufacture, a, single, product, without, having, to, have, metal, molds, so, the, costs, can, be, drastically, reduced, jaipur, foot, an, artificial, limb, from, jaipur, india, costs, about, us, 40, there, is, currently, an, open, design, prosthetics, forum, known, as, the, open, prosthetics, project, the, group, employs, collaborators, and, volunteers, to, advance, prosthetics, technology, while, attempting, to, lower, the, costs, of, these, necessary, devices, open, bionics, is, a, company, that, is, developing, open, source, robotic, prosthetic, hands, they, utilize, 3d, printing, to, manufacture, the, devices, and, low, cost, 3d, scanners, to, fit, them, onto, the, residual, limb, of, a, specific, patient, open, bionics, use, of, 3d, printing, allows, for, more, personalized, designs, such, as, the, hero, arm, which, incorporates, the, users, favourite, colours, textures, and, even, aesthetics, to, look, like, superheroes, or, characters, from, star, wars, with, the, aim, of, lowering, the, cost, a, review, study, on, a, wide, range, of, printed, prosthetic, hands, found, that, 3d, printing, technology, holds, a, promise, for, individualised, prosthesis, design, is, cheaper, than, commercial, prostheses, available, on, the, market, and, is, more, expensive, than, mass, production, processes, such, as, injection, molding, the, same, study, also, found, that, evidence, on, the, functionality, durability, and, user, acceptance, of, 3d, printed, hand, prostheses, is, still, lacking, in, the, usa, an, estimate, was, found, of, 32, 500, children, 21, years, had, a, major, paediatric, amputation, with, 5, 525, new, cases, each, year, of, which, 3, 315, congenital, carr, et, al, 1998, investigated, amputations, caused, by, landmines, for, afghanistan, bosnia, and, herzegovina,

000, amputees, 23, 500, annually, of, which, 10, 3, had, an, onset, of, disability, below, the, age, of, 14, amounting, to, a, total, of, about, 43, 700, limb, deficient, children, in, india, alone, few, low, cost, solutions, have, been, created, specially, for, children, examples, of, low, cost, prosthetic, devices, include, this, hand, held, pole, with, leather, support, band, or, platform, for, the, limb, is, one, of, the, simplest, and, cheapest, solutions, found, it, serves, well, as, a, short, term, solution, but, is, prone, to, rapid, contracture, formation, if, the, limb, is, not, stretched, daily, through, a, series, of, range, of, motion, rom, sets, this, also, fairly, simple, solution, comprises, a, plaster, socket, with, a, bamboo, or, pvc, pipe, at, the, bottom, optionally, attached, to, a, prosthetic, foot, this, solution, prevents, contractures, because, the, knee, is, moved, through, its, full, rom, the, david, werner, collection, an, online, database, for, the, assistance, of, disabled, village, children, displays, manuals, of, production, of, these, solutions, this, solution, is, built, using, a, bicycle, seat, post, up, side, down, as, foot, generating, flexibility, and, length, adjustability, it, is, a, very, cheap, solution, using, locally, available, materials, it, is, an, endoskeletal, modular, lower, limb, from, india, which, uses, thermoplastic, parts, its, main, advantages, are, the, small, weight, and, adaptability, monolimbs, are, non, modular, prostheses, and, thus, require, more, experienced, prosthetist, for, correct, fitting, because, alignment, can, barely, be, changed, after, production, however, their, durability, on, average, is, better, than, low, cost, modular, solutions, a, number, of, theorists, have, explored, the, meaning, and, implications, of, prosthetic, extension, of, the, body, elizabeth, grosz, writes, creatures, use, tools, ornaments, and, appliances, to, augment, their, bodily, capacities, are, their, bodies, lacking, something, which, they, need, to, replace, with, artificial, or, substitute, organs, or, conversely, should, prostheses, be, understood, in, terms, of, aesthetic, reorganization, and, proliferation, as, the, consequence, of, an, inventiveness, that, functions, beyond, and, perhaps, in, defiance, of, pragmatic, need, elaine, scarry, argues, that, every, artifact, recreates, and, extends, the, body, chairs, supplement, the, skeleton, tools, append, the, hands, clothing, augments, the, skin, in, scarry, s, thinking, furniture, and, houses, are, neither, more, nor, less, interior, to, the, human, body, than, the, food, it, absorbs, nor, are, they, fundamentally, different, from, such, sophisticated, prosthetics, as, artificial, lungs, eyes, and, kidneys, the, consumption, of, manufactured, things, turns, the, body, inside, out, opening, it, up, to, and, as, the, culture, of, objects, mark, wigley, a, professor, of, architecture, continues, this, line, of, thinking, about, how, architecture, supplements, our, natural, capabilities, and, argues, that, a, blurring, of, identity, is, produced, by, all, prostheses, some, of, this, work, relies, on, freud, s, earlier, characterization, of, man, s, relation, to, objects, as, one, of, extension, prosthetics, play, a, vital, role, in, how, a, person, perceives, themselves, and, how, other, people, perceive, them, the, ability, to, conceal, such, use, enabled, participants, to, ward, off, social, stigmatization, that, in, turn, enabled, their, social, integration, and, the, reduction, of, emotional, problems, surrounding, such, disability, people, that, lose, a, limb, first, have, to, deal, with, the, emotional, result, of, losing, that, limb, regardless, of, the, reasons, for, amputation, whether, due, to, traumatic, causes, or, as, a, consequence, of, illness, emotional, shock, exists, it, may, have, a, smaller, or, larger, amplitude, depending, on, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, patient, age, medical, culture, medical, cause, etc, as, a, result, of, amputation, the, research, participants, reports, were, loaded, with, drama, the, first, emotional, response, to, amputation, was, one, of, despair, a, severe, sense, of, self, collapse, something, almost, unbearable, emotional, factors, are, just, a, small, part, of, looking, at, social, implications, many, people, who, lose, a, limb, may, have, lots, of, anxiety, surrounding, prosthetics, and, their, limbs, after, surgery, for, an, extended, period, of, time, the, interviewed, patients, from, the, national, library, of, medicine, noticed, the, appearance, and, increase, of, anxiety, a, lot, of, negative, thoughts, invaded, their, minds, projections, about, the, future, were, grim, marked, by, sadness, helplessness, and, even, despair, existential, uncertainty, lack, of, control, and, further, anticipated, losses, in, one, s, life, due, to, amputation, were, the, primary, causes, of, anxiety, and, consequently, ruminations, and, insomnia, from, losing, a, leg, and, getting, a, prosthetics, there, were, also, many, factors, that, can, happen, including, anger, and, regret, the, amputation, of, a, limb, is, associated, not, only, with, physical, loss, and, change, in, body, image, but, also, with, an, abrupt, severing, in, one, s, sense, of, continuity, for, participants, with, amputation, as, a, result, of, physical, trauma, the, event, is, often, experienced, as, a, transgression, and, can, lead, to, frustration, and, anger, there, are, also, many, ethical, concerns, about, how, the, prosthetics, are, made, and, produced, a, wide, range, of, ethical, issues, arise, in, connection, with, experiments, and, clinical, usage, of, sensory, prostheses, animal, experimentation, informed, consent, for, instance, in, patients, with, a, locked, in, syndrome, that, may, be, alleviated, with, a, sensory, prosthesis, unrealistic, expectations, of, research, subjects, testing, new, devices, how, prosthetics, come, to, be, and, testing, of, the, usability, of, the, device, is, a, major, concern, in, the, medical, world, although, many, positives, come, when, a, new, prosthetic, design, is, announced, how, the, device, got, to, where, it, is, leads, to, some, questioning, the, ethics, of, prosthetics, there, are, also, many, debates, among, the, prosthetic, community, about, whether, they, should, wear, prosthetics, at, all, this, is, sparked, by, whether, prosthetics, help, in, day, to, day, living, or, make, it, harder, many, people, have, adapted, to, their, loss, of, limb, making, it, work, for, them, and, do, not, need, a, prosthesis, in, their, life, not, all, amputees, will, wear, a, prosthesis, in, a, 2011, national, survey, of, australian, amputees, limbs, 4, life, found, that, 7, percent, of, amputees, do, not, wear, a, prosthesis, and, in, another, australian, hospital, study, this, number, was, closer, to, 20, percent, many, people, report, being, uncomfortable, in, prostheses, and, not, wanting, to, wear, them, even, reporting, that, wearing, a, prosthetic, is, more, cumbersome, than, not, having, one, at, all, these, debates, are, natural, among, the, prosthetic, community, and, help, us, shed, light, on, the, issues, that, they, are, facing
