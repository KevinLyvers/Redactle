a, cannon, is, a, large, caliber, gun, classified, as, a, type, of, artillery, which, usually, launches, a, projectile, using, explosive, chemical, propellant, gunpowder, black, powder, was, the, primary, propellant, before, the, invention, of, smokeless, powder, during, the, late, 19th, century, cannons, vary, in, gauge, effective, range, mobility, rate, of, fire, angle, of, fire, and, firepower, different, forms, of, cannon, combine, and, balance, these, attributes, in, varying, degrees, depending, on, their, intended, use, on, the, battlefield, a, cannon, is, a, type, of, heavy, artillery, weapon, the, word, cannon, is, derived, from, several, languages, in, which, the, original, definition, can, usually, be, translated, as, tube, cane, or, reed, in, the, modern, era, the, term, cannon, has, fallen, into, decline, replaced, by, guns, or, artillery, if, not, a, more, specific, term, such, as, howitzer, or, mortar, except, for, high, caliber, automatic, weapons, firing, bigger, rounds, than, machine, guns, called, autocannons, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, cannons, appeared, in, song, dynasty, china, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, however, solid, archaeological, and, documentary, evidence, of, cannons, do, not, appear, until, the, 13th, century, in, 1288, yuan, dynasty, troops, are, recorded, to, have, used, hand, cannon, in, combat, and, the, earliest, extant, cannon, bearing, a, date, of, production, comes, from, the, same, period, by, the, early, 14th, century, possible, mentions, of, cannon, had, appeared, in, the, middle, east, and, the, depiction, of, one, in, europe, by, 1326, recorded, usage, of, cannon, began, appearing, almost, immediately, after, they, subsequently, spread, to, india, their, usage, on, the, subcontinent, being, first, attested, to, in, 1366, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, cannons, were, widespread, throughout, eurasia, cannons, were, used, primarily, as, anti, infantry, weapons, until, around, 1374, when, large, cannons, were, recorded, to, have, breached, walls, for, the, first, time, in, europe, cannons, featured, prominently, as, siege, weapons, and, ever, larger, pieces, appeared, in, 1464, a, 16, 000, kg, 35, 000, lb, cannon, known, as, the, great, turkish, bombard, was, created, in, the, ottoman, empire, cannons, as, field, artillery, became, more, important, after, 1453, when, cannons, broke, down, the, walls, of, the, roman, empire, s, capital, with, the, introduction, of, limber, which, greatly, improved, cannon, maneuverability, and, mobility, european, cannons, reached, their, longer, lighter, more, accurate, and, more, efficient, classic, form, around, 1480, this, classic, european, cannon, design, stayed, relatively, consistent, in, form, with, minor, changes, until, the, 1750s, the, word, cannon, is, derived, from, the, old, italian, word, cannone, meaning, large, tube, which, came, from, the, latin, canna, in, turn, originating, from, the, greek, kanna, reed, and, then, generalised, to, mean, any, hollow, tube, like, object, the, word, has, been, used, to, refer, to, a, gun, since, 1326, in, italy, and, 1418, in, england, both, of, the, plural, forms, cannons, and, cannon, are, correct, the, cannon, may, have, appeared, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, in, china, and, was, probably, a, parallel, development, or, evolution, of, the, fire, lance, a, short, ranged, anti, personnel, weapon, combining, a, gunpowder, filled, tube, and, a, polearm, co, viative, projectiles, such, as, iron, scraps, or, porcelain, shards, were, placed, in, fire, lance, barrels, at, some, point, and, eventually, the, paper, and, bamboo, materials, of, fire, lance, barrels, were, replaced, by, metal, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, a, cannon, is, a, sculpture, from, the, dazu, rock, carvings, in, sichuan, dated, to, 1128, however, the, earliest, archaeological, samples, and, textual, accounts, do, not, appear, until, the, 13th, century, the, primary, extant, specimens, of, cannon, from, the, 13th, century, are, the, wuwei, bronze, cannon, dated, to, 1227, the, heilongjiang, hand, cannon, dated, to, 1288, and, the, xanadu, gun, dated, to, 1298, however, only, the, xanadu, gun, contains, an, inscription, bearing, a, date, of, production, so, it, is, considered, the, earliest, confirmed, extant, cannon, the, xanadu, gun, is, 34, 7, cm, in, length, and, weighs, 6, 2, kg, the, other, cannons, are, dated, using, contextual, evidence, the, heilongjiang, hand, cannon, is, also, often, considered, by, some, to, be, the, oldest, firearm, since, it, was, unearthed, near, the, area, where, the, history, of, yuan, reports, a, battle, took, place, involving, hand, cannons, according, to, the, history, of, yuan, in, 1288, a, jurchen, commander, by, the, name, of, li, ting, led, troops, armed, with, hand, cannons, into, battle, against, the, rebel, prince, nayan, chen, bingying, argues, there, were, no, guns, before, 1259, while, dang, shoushan, believes, the, wuwei, gun, and, other, western, xia, era, samples, point, to, the, appearance, of, guns, by, 1220, and, stephen, haw, goes, even, further, by, stating, that, guns, were, developed, as, early, as, 1200, sinologist, joseph, needham, and, renaissance, siege, expert, thomas, arnold, provide, a, more, conservative, estimate, of, around, 1280, for, the, appearance, of, the, true, cannon, whether, or, not, any, of, these, are, correct, it, seems, likely, that, the, gun, was, born, sometime, during, the, 13th, century, references, to, cannons, proliferated, throughout, china, in, the, following, centuries, cannon, featured, in, literary, pieces, in, 1341, xian, zhang, wrote, a, poem, called, the, iron, cannon, affair, describing, a, cannonball, fired, from, an, eruptor, which, could, pierce, the, heart, or, belly, when, striking, a, man, or, horse, and, even, transfix, several, persons, at, once, by, the, 1350s, the, cannon, was, used, extensively, in, chinese, warfare, in, 1358, the, ming, army, failed, to, take, a, city, due, to, its, garrisons, usage, of, cannon, however, they, themselves, would, use, cannon, in, the, thousands, later, on, during, the, siege, of, suzhou, in, 1366, the, mongol, invasion, of, java, in, 1293, brought, gunpowder, technology, to, the, nusantara, archipelago, in, the, form, of, cannon, chinese, pao, during, the, ming, dynasty, cannons, were, used, in, riverine, warfare, at, the, battle, of, lake, poyang, one, shipwreck, in, shandong, had, a, cannon, dated, to, 1377, and, an, anchor, dated, to, 1372, from, the, 13th, to, 15th, centuries, cannon, armed, chinese, ships, also, travelled, throughout, southeast, asia, cannon, appeared, in, i, vi, t, by, 1390, at, the, latest, the, first, of, the, western, cannon, to, be, introduced, were, breech, loaders, in, the, early, 16th, century, which, the, chinese, began, producing, themselves, by, 1523, and, improved, on, by, including, composite, metal, construction, in, their, making, japan, did, not, acquire, cannon, until, 1510, when, a, monk, brought, one, back, from, china, and, did, not, produce, any, in, appreciable, numbers, during, the, 1593, siege, of, pyongyang, 40, 000, ming, troops, deployed, a, variety, of, cannons, against, japanese, troops, despite, their, defensive, advantage, and, the, use, of, arquebus, by, japanese, soldiers, the, japanese, were, at, a, severe, disadvantage, due, to, their, lack, of, cannon, throughout, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, 1592, 1598, the, ming, joseon, coalition, used, artillery, widely, in, land, and, naval, battles, including, on, the, turtle, ships, of, yi, sun, sin, according, to, ivan, petlin, the, first, russian, envoy, to, beijing, in, september, 1619, the, city, was, armed, with, large, cannon, with, cannonballs, weighing, more, than, 30, kg, 66, lb, his, general, observation, was, there, are, many, merchants, and, military, persons, in, the, chinese, empire, they, have, firearms, and, the, chinese, are, very, skillful, in, military, affairs, they, go, into, battle, against, the, yellow, mongols, who, fight, with, bows, and, arrows, outside, of, china, the, earliest, texts, to, mention, gunpowder, are, roger, bacon, s, opus, majus, 1267, and, opus, tertium, in, what, has, been, interpreted, as, references, to, firecrackers, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, british, artillery, officer, proposed, that, another, work, tentatively, attributed, to, bacon, epistola, de, secretis, operibus, artis, et, naturae, et, de, nullitate, magiae, dated, to, 1247, contained, an, encrypted, formula, for, gunpowder, hidden, in, the, text, these, claims, have, been, disputed, by, science, historians, in, any, case, the, formula, itself, is, not, useful, for, firearms, or, even, firecrackers, burning, slowly, and, producing, mostly, smoke, there, is, a, record, of, a, gun, in, europe, dating, to, 1322, being, discovered, in, the, nineteenth, century, but, the, artifact, has, since, been, lost, the, earliest, known, european, depiction, of, a, gun, appeared, in, 1326, in, a, manuscript, by, walter, de, milemete, although, not, necessarily, drawn, by, him, known, as, de, nobilitatibus, sapientii, et, prudentiis, regum, concerning, the, majesty, wisdom, and, prudence, of, kings, which, displays, a, gun, with, a, large, arrow, emerging, from, it, and, its, user, lowering, a, long, stick, to, ignite, the, gun, through, the, touch, hole, in, the, same, year, another, similar, illustration, showed, a, darker, gun, being, set, off, by, a, group, of, knights, in, another, work, of, de, milemete, s, de, secretis, secretorum, aristotelis, on, 11, february, of, that, same, year, the, signoria, of, florence, appointed, two, officers, to, obtain, canones, de, mettallo, and, ammunition, for, the, town, s, defense, in, the, following, year, a, document, from, the, turin, area, recorded, a, certain, amount, was, paid, for, the, making, of, a, certain, instrument, or, device, made, by, friar, marcello, for, the, projection, of, pellets, of, lead, a, reference, from, 1331, describes, an, attack, mounted, by, two, germanic, knights, on, cividale, del, friuli, using, man, portable, gunpowder, weapons, of, some, sort, the, 1320s, seem, to, have, been, the, takeoff, point, for, guns, in, europe, according, to, most, modern, military, historians, scholars, suggest, that, the, lack, of, gunpowder, weapons, in, a, well, traveled, venetian, s, catalogue, for, a, new, crusade, in, 1321, implies, that, guns, were, unknown, in, europe, up, until, this, point, further, solidifying, the, 1320, mark, however, more, evidence, in, this, area, may, be, forthcoming, in, the, future, the, oldest, extant, cannon, in, europe, is, a, small, bronze, example, unearthed, in, loshult, scania, in, southern, sweden, it, dates, from, the, early, mid, 14th, century, and, is, currently, in, the, swedish, history, museum, in, stockholm, early, cannons, in, europe, often, shot, arrows, and, were, known, by, an, assortment, of, names, such, as, pot, de, fer, tonnoire, ribaldis, and, b, szenpyle, the, ribaldis, which, shot, large, arrows, and, simplistic, grapeshot, were, first, mentioned, in, the, english, privy, wardrobe, accounts, during, preparations, for, the, battle, of, cr, cy, between, 1345, and, 1346, the, florentine, giovanni, villani, recounts, their, destructiveness, indicating, that, by, the, end, of, the, battle, the, whole, plain, was, covered, by, men, struck, down, by, arrows, and, cannon, balls, similar, cannon, were, also, used, at, the, siege, of, calais, 1346, 47, although, it, was, not, until, the, 1380s, that, the, ribaudekin, clearly, became, mounted, on, wheels, the, battle, of, crecy, which, pitted, the, english, against, the, french, in, 1346, featured, the, early, use, of, cannon, which, helped, the, longbowmen, repulse, a, large, force, of, genoese, crossbowmen, deployed, by, the, french, the, english, originally, intended, to, use, the, cannon, against, cavalry, sent, to, attack, their, archers, thinking, that, the, loud, noises, produced, by, their, cannon, would, panic, the, advancing, horses, along, with, killing, the, knights, atop, them, early, cannons, could, also, be, used, for, more, than, simply, killing, men, and, scaring, horses, english, cannon, were, used, defensively, in, 1346, during, the, siege, of, breteuil, to, launch, fire, onto, an, advancing, siege, tower, in, this, way, cannons, could, be, used, to, burn, down, siege, equipment, before, it, reached, the, fortifications, the, use, of, cannons, to, shoot, fire, could, also, be, used, offensively, as, another, battle, involved, the, setting, of, a, castle, ablaze, with, similar, methods, the, particular, incendiary, used, in, these, projectiles, was, most, likely, a, gunpowder, mixture, this, is, one, area, where, early, chinese, and, european, cannons, share, a, similarity, as, both, were, possibly, used, to, shoot, fire, another, aspect, of, early, european, cannons, is, that, they, were, rather, small, dwarfed, by, the, bombards, which, would, come, later, in, fact, it, is, possible, that, the, cannons, used, at, cr, cy, were, capable, of, being, moved, rather, quickly, as, there, is, an, anonymous, chronicle, that, notes, the, guns, being, used, to, attack, the, french, camp, indicating, that, they, would, have, been, mobile, enough, to, press, the, attack, these, smaller, cannons, would, eventually, give, way, to, larger, wall, breaching, guns, by, the, end, of, the, 1300s, there, is, no, clear, consensus, on, when, the, cannon, first, appeared, in, the, islamic, world, with, dates, ranging, from, 1260, to, the, mid, 14th, century, the, cannon, may, have, appeared, in, the, islamic, world, in, the, late, 13th, century, with, ibn, khaldun, in, the, 14th, century, stating, that, cannons, were, used, in, the, maghreb, region, of, north, africa, in, 1274, and, other, arabic, military, treatises, in, the, 14th, century, referring, to, the, use, of, cannon, by, mamluk, forces, in, 1260, and, 1303, and, by, muslim, forces, at, the, 1324, siege, of, huesca, in, spain, however, some, scholars, do, not, accept, these, early, dates, while, the, date, of, its, first, appearance, is, not, entirely, clear, the, general, consensus, among, most, historians, is, that, there, is, no, doubt, the, mamluk, forces, were, using, cannon, by, 1342, other, accounts, may, have, also, mentioned, the, use, of, cannon, in, the, early, 14th, century, an, arabic, text, dating, to, 1320, 1350, describes, a, type, of, gunpowder, weapon, called, a, midfa, which, uses, gunpowder, to, shoot, projectiles, out, of, a, tube, at, the, end, of, a, stock, some, scholars, consider, this, a, hand, cannon, while, others, dispute, this, claim, the, nasrid, army, besieging, elche, in, 1331, made, use, of, iron, pellets, shot, with, fire, according, to, historian, ahmad, y, al, hassan, during, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, in, 1260, the, mamluks, used, cannon, against, the, mongols, he, claims, that, this, was, the, first, cannon, in, history, and, used, a, gunpowder, formula, almost, identical, to, the, ideal, composition, for, explosive, gunpowder, he, also, argues, that, this, was, not, known, in, china, or, europe, until, much, later, al, hassan, further, claims, that, the, earliest, textual, evidence, of, cannon, is, from, the, middle, east, based, on, earlier, originals, which, report, hand, held, cannons, being, used, by, the, mamluks, at, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, in, 1260, such, an, early, date, is, not, accepted, by, some, historians, including, david, ayalon, iqtidar, alam, khan, joseph, needham, and, tonio, andrade, khan, argues, that, it, was, the, mongols, who, introduced, gunpowder, to, the, islamic, world, and, believes, cannon, only, reached, mamluk, egypt, in, the, 1370s, needham, argued, that, the, term, midfa, dated, to, textual, sources, from, 1342, to, 1352, did, not, refer, to, true, hand, guns, or, bombards, and, that, contemporary, accounts, of, a, metal, barrel, cannon, in, the, islamic, world, did, not, occur, until, 1365, similarly, andrade, dates, the, textual, appearance, of, cannons, in, middle, eastern, sources, to, the, 1360s, gabor, goston, and, david, ayalon, note, that, the, mamluks, had, certainly, used, siege, cannons, by, 1342, or, the, 1360s, respectively, but, earlier, uses, of, cannons, in, the, islamic, world, are, vague, with, a, possible, appearance, in, the, emirate, of, granada, by, the, 1320s, and, 1330s, though, evidence, is, inconclusive, ibn, khaldun, reported, the, use, of, cannon, as, siege, machines, by, the, marinid, sultan, abu, yaqub, yusuf, at, the, siege, of, sijilmasa, in, 1274, the, passage, by, ibn, khaldun, on, the, marinid, siege, of, sijilmassa, in, 1274, occurs, as, follows, installed, siege, engines, and, gunpowder, engines, which, project, small, balls, of, iron, these, balls, are, ejected, from, a, chamber, placed, in, front, of, a, kindling, fire, of, gunpowder, this, happens, by, a, strange, property, which, attributes, all, actions, to, the, power, of, the, creator, the, source, is, not, contemporary, and, was, written, a, century, later, around, 1382, its, interpretation, has, been, rejected, as, anachronistic, by, some, historians, who, urge, caution, regarding, claims, of, islamic, firearms, use, in, the, 1204, 1324, period, as, late, medieval, arabic, texts, used, the, same, word, for, gunpowder, naft, as, they, did, for, an, earlier, incendiary, naphtha, goston, and, peter, purton, note, that, in, the, 1204, 1324, period, late, medieval, arabic, texts, used, the, same, word, for, gunpowder, naft, that, they, used, for, an, earlier, incendiary, naphtha, needham, believes, ibn, khaldun, was, speaking, of, fire, lances, rather, than, hand, cannon, the, ottoman, empire, made, good, use, of, cannon, as, siege, artillery, sixty, eight, super, sized, bombards, were, used, by, mehmed, the, conqueror, to, capture, constantinople, in, 1453, jim, bradbury, argues, that, urban, a, hungarian, cannon, engineer, introduced, this, cannon, from, central, europe, to, the, ottoman, realm, according, to, paul, hammer, however, it, could, have, been, introduced, from, other, islamic, countries, which, had, earlier, used, cannons, these, cannon, could, fire, heavy, stone, balls, a, mile, and, the, sound, of, their, blast, could, reportedly, be, heard, from, a, distance, of, 10, miles, 16, km, shkod, ran, historian, marin, barleti, discusses, turkish, bombards, at, length, in, his, book, de, obsidione, scodrensi, 1504, describing, the, 1478, 79, siege, of, shkodra, in, which, eleven, bombards, and, two, mortars, were, employed, the, ottomans, also, used, cannon, to, control, passage, of, ships, through, the, bosphorus, strait, ottoman, cannons, also, proved, effective, at, stopping, crusaders, at, varna, in, 1444, and, kosovo, in, 1448, despite, the, presence, of, european, cannon, in, the, former, case, the, similar, dardanelles, guns, for, the, location, were, created, by, munir, ali, in, 1464, and, were, still, in, use, during, the, anglo, turkish, war, 1807, 1809, these, were, cast, in, bronze, into, two, parts, the, chase, the, barrel, and, the, breech, which, combined, weighed, 18, 4, tonnes, the, two, parts, were, screwed, together, using, levers, to, facilitate, moving, it, fathullah, shirazi, a, persian, inhabitant, of, india, who, worked, for, akbar, in, the, mughal, empire, developed, a, volley, gun, in, the, 16th, century, while, there, is, evidence, of, cannons, in, iran, as, early, as, 1405, they, were, not, widespread, this, changed, following, the, increased, use, of, firearms, by, shah, ismail, i, and, the, iranian, army, used, 500, cannons, by, the, 1620s, probably, captured, from, the, ottomans, or, acquired, by, allies, in, europe, by, 1443, iranians, were, also, making, some, of, their, own, cannon, as, mir, khawand, wrote, of, a, 1200, kg, metal, piece, being, made, by, an, iranian, rikhtegar, which, was, most, likely, a, cannon, due, to, the, difficulties, of, transporting, cannon, in, mountainous, terrain, their, use, was, less, common, compared, to, their, use, in, europe, documentary, evidence, of, cannons, in, russia, does, not, appear, until, 1382, and, they, were, used, only, in, sieges, often, by, the, defenders, it, was, not, until, 1475, when, ivan, iii, established, the, first, russian, cannon, foundry, in, moscow, that, they, began, to, produce, cannons, natively, the, earliest, surviving, cannon, from, russia, dates, to, 1485, later, on, large, cannons, were, known, as, bombards, ranging, from, three, to, five, feet, in, length, and, were, used, by, dubrovnik, and, kotor, in, defence, during, the, later, 14th, century, the, first, bombards, were, made, of, iron, but, bronze, became, more, prevalent, as, it, was, recognized, as, more, stable, and, capable, of, propelling, stones, weighing, as, much, as, 45, kilograms, 99, lb, around, the, same, period, the, byzantine, empire, began, to, accumulate, its, own, cannon, to, face, the, ottoman, empire, starting, with, medium, sized, cannon, 3, feet, 0, 91, m, long, and, of, 10, in, calibre, the, earliest, reliable, recorded, use, of, artillery, in, the, region, was, against, the, ottoman, siege, of, constantinople, in, 1396, forcing, the, ottomans, to, withdraw, the, ottomans, acquired, their, own, cannon, and, laid, siege, to, the, byzantine, capital, again, in, 1422, by, 1453, the, ottomans, used, 68, hungarian, made, cannon, for, the, 55, day, bombardment, of, the, walls, of, constantinople, hurling, the, pieces, everywhere, and, killing, those, who, happened, to, be, nearby, the, largest, of, their, cannons, was, the, great, turkish, bombard, which, required, an, operating, crew, of, 200, men, and, 70, oxen, and, 10, 000, men, to, transport, it, gunpowder, made, the, formerly, devastating, greek, fire, obsolete, and, with, the, final, fall, of, constantinople, which, was, protected, by, what, were, once, the, strongest, walls, in, europe, on, 29, may, 1453, it, was, the, end, of, an, era, in, more, ways, than, one, cannons, were, introduced, to, the, javanese, majapahit, empire, when, kublai, khan, s, mongol, chinese, army, under, the, leadership, of, ike, mese, sought, to, invade, java, in, 1293, history, of, yuan, mentioned, that, the, mongol, used, a, weapon, called, p, ao, against, daha, forces, 1, 2, 244, 245, 220, this, weapon, is, interpreted, differently, by, researchers, it, may, be, a, trebuchet, that, throws, thunderclap, bombs, firearms, cannons, or, rockets, it, is, possible, that, the, gunpowder, weapons, carried, by, the, mongol, chinese, troops, amounted, to, more, than, one, type, 97, thomas, stamford, raffles, wrote, in, the, history, of, java, that, in, 1247, saka, 1325, ad, cannons, were, widely, used, in, java, especially, by, the, majapahit, it, is, recorded, that, the, small, kingdoms, in, java, that, sought, the, protection, of, majapahit, had, to, hand, over, their, cannons, to, the, majapahit, 106, 61, majapahit, under, mahapatih, prime, minister, gajah, mada, in, office, 1331, 1364, utilized, gunpowder, technology, obtained, from, yuan, dynasty, for, use, in, naval, fleet, 57, mongol, chinese, gunpowder, technology, of, yuan, dynasty, resulted, in, eastern, style, cetbang, which, is, similar, to, chinese, cannon, swivel, guns, however, only, developed, in, the, archipelago, because, of, the, close, maritime, relations, of, the, nusantara, archipelago, with, the, territory, of, west, india, after, 1460, ad, which, brought, new, types, of, gunpowder, weapons, to, the, archipelago, likely, through, arab, intermediaries, this, weapon, seems, to, be, cannon, and, gun, of, ottoman, tradition, for, example, the, prangi, which, is, a, breech, loading, swivel, gun, a, new, type, of, cetbang, called, the, western, style, cetbang, was, derived, from, the, turkish, prangi, just, like, prangi, this, cetbang, is, a, breech, loading, swivel, gun, made, of, bronze, or, iron, firing, single, rounds, or, scattershots, a, large, number, of, small, bullets, 94, 95, cannons, derived, from, western, style, cetbang, can, be, found, in, nusantara, among, others, were, lantaka, and, lela, most, lantakas, were, made, of, bronze, and, the, earliest, ones, were, breech, loaded, there, is, a, trend, toward, muzzle, loading, weapons, during, colonial, times, when, the, portuguese, came, to, the, archipelago, they, referred, to, the, breech, loading, swivel, gun, as, ber, o, while, the, spaniards, call, it, verso, 151, a, pole, gun, bedil, tombak, was, recorded, as, being, used, by, java, in, 1413, 245, duarte, barbosa, c, 1514, said, that, the, inhabitants, of, java, were, great, masters, in, casting, artillery, and, very, good, artillerymen, they, made, many, one, pounder, cannon, cetbang, or, rentaka, long, muskets, spingarde, arquebus, schioppi, hand, cannon, greek, fire, guns, cannon, and, other, fireworks, every, place, was, considered, excellent, in, casting, artillery, and, in, the, knowledge, of, using, it, 198, 224, in, 1513, the, javanese, fleet, led, by, pati, unus, sailed, to, attack, portuguese, malacca, with, much, artillery, made, in, java, for, the, javanese, are, skilled, in, founding, and, casting, and, in, all, works, in, iron, over, and, above, what, they, have, in, india, 162, 23, by, early, 16th, century, the, javanese, already, locally, producing, large, guns, some, of, them, still, survived, until, the, present, day, and, dubbed, as, sacred, cannon, or, holy, cannon, these, cannons, varied, between, 180, and, 260, pounders, weighing, anywhere, between, 3, and, 8, tons, length, of, them, between, 3, and, 6, m, 9, 8, and, 19, 7, ft, cannons, were, used, by, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, in, 1352, during, its, invasion, of, the, khmer, empire, within, a, decade, large, quantities, of, gunpowder, could, be, found, in, the, khmer, empire, by, the, end, of, the, century, firearms, were, also, used, by, the, tr, n, dynasty, saltpeter, harvesting, was, recorded, by, dutch, and, german, travelers, as, being, common, in, even, the, smallest, villages, and, was, collected, from, the, decomposition, process, of, large, dung, hills, specifically, piled, for, the, purpose, the, dutch, punishment, for, possession, of, non, permitted, gunpowder, appears, to, have, been, amputation, 180, 181, ownership, and, manufacture, of, gunpowder, was, later, prohibited, by, the, colonial, dutch, occupiers, according, to, colonel, mckenzie, quoted, in, sir, thomas, stamford, raffles, the, history, of, java, 1817, the, purest, sulfur, was, supplied, from, a, crater, from, a, mountain, near, the, straits, of, bali, 180, 181, in, africa, the, adal, sultanate, and, the, abyssinian, empire, both, deployed, cannons, during, the, adal, abyssinian, war, imported, from, arabia, and, the, wider, islamic, world, the, adalites, led, by, ahmed, ibn, ibrahim, al, ghazi, were, the, first, african, power, to, introduce, cannon, warfare, to, the, african, continent, later, on, as, the, portuguese, empire, entered, the, war, it, would, supply, and, train, the, abyssinians, with, cannons, while, the, ottoman, empire, sent, soldiers, and, cannon, to, back, adal, the, conflict, proved, through, their, use, on, both, sides, the, value, of, firearms, such, as, the, matchlock, musket, cannon, and, the, arquebus, over, traditional, weapons, while, previous, smaller, guns, could, burn, down, structures, with, fire, larger, cannons, were, so, effective, that, engineers, were, forced, to, develop, stronger, castle, walls, to, prevent, their, keeps, from, falling, nonetheless, cannons, were, used, other, purposes, than, battering, down, walls, as, fortifications, began, using, cannons, as, defensive, instruments, such, as, an, example, in, india, where, the, fort, of, raicher, had, gun, ports, built, into, its, walls, to, accommodate, the, use, of, defensive, cannons, in, the, art, of, war, niccol, machiavelli, opined, that, field, artillery, forced, an, army, to, take, up, a, defensive, posture, and, this, opposed, a, more, ideal, offensive, stance, machiavelli, s, concerns, can, be, seen, in, the, criticisms, of, portuguese, mortars, being, used, in, india, during, the, sixteenth, century, as, lack, of, mobility, was, one, of, the, key, problems, with, the, design, in, russia, the, early, cannons, were, again, placed, in, forts, as, a, defensive, tool, cannon, were, also, difficult, to, move, around, in, certain, types, of, terrain, with, mountains, providing, a, great, obstacle, for, them, for, these, reasons, offensives, conducted, with, cannons, would, be, difficult, to, pull, off, in, places, such, as, iran, by, the, 16th, century, cannons, were, made, in, a, great, variety, of, lengths, and, bore, diameters, but, the, general, rule, was, that, the, longer, the, barrel, the, longer, the, range, some, cannons, made, during, this, time, had, barrels, exceeding, 10, ft, 3, 0, m, in, length, and, could, weigh, up, to, 20, 000, pounds, 9, 100, kg, consequently, large, amounts, of, gunpowder, were, needed, to, allow, them, to, fire, stone, balls, several, hundred, yards, by, mid, century, european, monarchs, began, to, classify, cannons, to, reduce, the, confusion, henry, ii, of, france, opted, for, six, sizes, of, cannon, but, others, settled, for, more, the, spanish, used, twelve, sizes, and, the, english, sixteen, they, are, from, largest, to, smallest, the, cannon, royal, cannon, cannon, serpentine, bastard, cannon, demicannon, pedrero, culverin, basilisk, demiculverin, bastard, culverin, saker, minion, falcon, falconet, serpentine, and, rabinet, better, powder, had, been, developed, by, this, time, as, well, instead, of, the, finely, ground, powder, used, by, the, first, bombards, powder, was, replaced, by, a, corned, variety, of, coarse, grains, this, coarse, powder, had, pockets, of, air, between, grains, allowing, fire, to, travel, through, and, ignite, the, entire, charge, quickly, and, uniformly, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, saw, the, construction, of, larger, more, powerful, cannon, as, well, as, their, spread, throughout, the, world, as, they, were, not, effective, at, breaching, the, newer, fortifications, resulting, from, the, development, of, cannon, siege, engines, such, as, siege, towers, and, trebuchets, became, less, widely, used, however, wooden, battery, towers, took, on, a, similar, role, as, siege, towers, in, the, gunpowder, age, such, as, that, used, at, siege, of, kazan, in, 1552, which, could, hold, ten, large, calibre, cannon, in, addition, to, 50, lighter, pieces, another, notable, effect, of, cannon, on, warfare, during, this, period, was, the, change, in, conventional, fortifications, niccol, machiavelli, wrote, there, is, no, wall, whatever, its, thickness, that, artillery, will, not, destroy, in, only, a, few, days, although, castles, were, not, immediately, made, obsolete, by, cannon, their, use, and, importance, on, the, battlefield, rapidly, declined, instead, of, majestic, towers, and, merlons, the, walls, of, new, fortresses, were, thick, angled, and, sloped, while, towers, became, low, and, stout, increasing, use, was, also, made, of, earth, and, brick, in, breastworks, and, redoubts, these, new, defences, became, known, as, bastion, forts, after, their, characteristic, shape, which, attempted, to, force, any, advance, towards, it, directly, into, the, firing, line, of, the, guns, a, few, of, these, featured, cannon, batteries, such, as, the, house, of, tudor, s, device, forts, in, england, bastion, forts, soon, replaced, castles, in, europe, and, eventually, those, in, the, americas, as, well, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, several, technological, advancements, made, cannons, more, mobile, wheeled, gun, carriages, and, trunnions, became, common, and, the, invention, of, the, limber, further, facilitated, transportation, as, a, result, field, artillery, became, more, viable, and, began, to, see, more, widespread, use, often, alongside, the, larger, cannons, intended, for, sieges, better, gunpowder, cast, iron, projectiles, replacing, stone, and, the, standardisation, of, calibres, meant, that, even, relatively, light, cannons, could, be, deadly, in, the, art, of, war, niccol, machiavelli, observed, that, it, is, true, that, the, arquebuses, and, the, small, artillery, do, much, more, harm, than, the, heavy, artillery, this, was, the, case, at, the, battle, of, flodden, in, 1513, the, english, field, guns, outfired, the, scottish, siege, artillery, firing, two, or, three, times, as, many, rounds, despite, the, increased, maneuverability, however, cannon, were, still, the, slowest, component, of, the, army, a, heavy, english, cannon, required, 23, horses, to, transport, while, a, culverin, needed, nine, even, with, this, many, animals, pulling, they, still, moved, at, a, walking, pace, due, to, their, relatively, slow, speed, and, lack, of, organisation, and, undeveloped, tactics, the, combination, of, pike, and, shot, still, dominated, the, battlefields, of, europe, innovations, continued, notably, the, german, invention, of, the, mortar, a, thick, walled, short, barrelled, gun, that, blasted, shot, upward, at, a, steep, angle, mortars, were, useful, for, sieges, as, they, could, hit, targets, behind, walls, or, other, defences, this, cannon, found, more, use, with, the, dutch, who, learnt, to, shoot, bombs, filled, with, powder, from, them, setting, the, bomb, fuse, was, a, problem, single, firing, was, first, used, to, ignite, the, fuse, where, the, bomb, was, placed, with, the, fuse, down, against, the, cannon, s, propellant, this, often, resulted, in, the, fuse, being, blown, into, the, bomb, causing, it, to, blow, up, as, it, left, the, mortar, because, of, this, double, firing, was, tried, where, the, gunner, lit, the, fuse, and, then, the, touch, hole, this, required, considerable, skill, and, timing, and, was, especially, dangerous, if, the, gun, misfired, leaving, a, lighted, bomb, in, the, barrel, not, until, 1650, was, it, accidentally, discovered, that, double, lighting, was, superfluous, as, the, heat, of, firing, would, light, the, fuse, gustavus, adolphus, of, sweden, emphasised, the, use, of, light, cannon, and, mobility, in, his, army, and, created, new, formations, and, tactics, that, revolutionised, artillery, he, discontinued, using, all, 12, pounder, or, heavier, cannon, as, field, artillery, preferring, instead, to, use, cannons, that, could, be, handled, by, only, a, few, men, one, obsolete, type, of, gun, the, leatheren, was, replaced, by, 4, pounder, and, 9, pounder, demi, culverins, these, could, be, operated, by, three, men, and, pulled, by, only, two, horses, gustavus, adolphus, s, army, was, also, the, first, to, use, a, cartridge, that, contained, both, powder, and, shot, which, sped, up, reloading, increasing, the, rate, of, fire, finally, against, infantry, he, pioneered, the, use, of, canister, shot, essentially, a, tin, can, filled, with, musket, balls, until, then, there, was, no, more, than, one, cannon, for, every, thousand, infantrymen, on, the, battlefield, but, gustavus, adolphus, increased, the, number, of, cannons, sixfold, each, regiment, was, assigned, two, pieces, though, he, often, arranged, them, into, batteries, instead, of, distributing, them, piecemeal, he, used, these, batteries, to, break, his, opponent, s, infantry, line, while, his, cavalry, would, outflank, their, heavy, guns, at, the, battle, of, breitenfeld, in, 1631, adolphus, proved, the, effectiveness, of, the, changes, made, to, his, army, by, defeating, johann, tserclaes, count, of, tilly, although, severely, outnumbered, the, swedes, were, able, to, fire, between, three, and, five, times, as, many, volleys, of, artillery, and, their, infantry, s, linear, formations, helped, ensure, they, did, not, lose, any, ground, battered, by, cannon, fire, and, low, on, morale, tilly, s, men, broke, ranks, and, fled, in, england, cannons, were, being, used, to, besiege, various, fortified, buildings, during, the, english, civil, war, nathaniel, nye, is, recorded, as, testing, a, birmingham, cannon, in, 1643, and, experimenting, with, a, saker, in, 1645, from, 1645, he, was, the, master, gunner, to, the, parliamentarian, garrison, at, evesham, and, in, 1646, he, successfully, directed, the, artillery, at, the, siege, of, worcester, detailing, his, experiences, and, in, his, 1647, book, the, art, of, gunnery, believing, that, war, was, as, much, a, science, as, an, art, his, explanations, focused, on, triangulation, arithmetic, theoretical, mathematics, and, cartography, as, well, as, practical, considerations, such, as, the, ideal, specification, for, gunpowder, or, slow, matches, his, book, acknowledged, mathematicians, such, as, robert, recorde, and, marcus, jordanus, as, well, as, earlier, military, writers, on, artillery, such, as, niccol, fontana, tartaglia, and, thomas, or, francis, malthus, author, of, a, treatise, on, artificial, fire, works, around, this, time, also, came, the, idea, of, aiming, the, cannon, to, hit, a, target, gunners, controlled, the, range, of, their, cannons, by, measuring, the, angle, of, elevation, using, a, gunner, s, quadrant, cannons, did, not, have, sights, therefore, even, with, measuring, tools, aiming, was, still, largely, guesswork, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, french, engineer, s, bastien, le, prestre, de, vauban, introduced, a, more, systematic, and, scientific, approach, to, attacking, gunpowder, fortresses, in, a, time, when, many, field, commanders, were, notorious, dunces, in, siegecraft, careful, sapping, forward, supported, by, enfilading, ricochets, was, a, key, feature, of, this, system, and, it, even, allowed, vauban, to, calculate, the, length, of, time, a, siege, would, take, he, was, also, a, prolific, builder, of, bastion, forts, and, did, much, to, popularize, the, idea, of, depth, in, defence, in, the, face, of, cannon, these, principles, were, followed, into, the, mid, 19th, century, when, changes, in, armaments, necessitated, greater, depth, defence, than, vauban, had, provided, for, it, was, only, in, the, years, prior, to, world, war, i, that, new, works, began, to, break, radically, away, from, his, designs, the, lower, tier, of, 17th, century, english, ships, of, the, line, were, usually, equipped, with, demi, cannons, guns, that, fired, a, 32, pound, 15, kg, solid, shot, and, could, weigh, up, to, 3, 400, pounds, 1, 500, kg, demi, cannons, were, capable, of, firing, these, heavy, metal, balls, with, such, force, that, they, could, penetrate, more, than, a, metre, of, solid, oak, from, a, distance, of, 90, m, 300, ft, and, could, dismast, even, the, largest, ships, at, close, range, full, cannon, fired, a, 42, pound, 19, kg, shot, but, were, discontinued, by, the, 18th, century, as, they, were, too, unwieldy, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, principles, long, adopted, in, europe, specified, the, characteristics, of, the, royal, navy, s, cannon, as, well, as, the, acceptable, defects, and, their, severity, the, united, states, navy, tested, guns, by, measuring, them, firing, them, two, or, three, times, termed, proof, by, powder, and, using, pressurized, water, to, detect, leaks, the, carronade, was, adopted, by, the, royal, navy, in, 1779, the, lower, muzzle, velocity, of, the, round, shot, when, fired, from, this, cannon, was, intended, to, create, more, wooden, splinters, when, hitting, the, structure, of, an, enemy, vessel, as, they, were, believed, to, be, more, deadly, than, the, ball, by, itself, the, carronade, was, much, shorter, and, weighed, between, a, third, to, a, quarter, of, the, equivalent, long, gun, for, example, a, 32, pounder, carronade, weighed, less, than, a, ton, compared, with, a, 32, pounder, long, gun, which, weighed, over, 3, tons, the, guns, were, therefore, easier, to, handle, and, also, required, less, than, half, as, much, gunpowder, allowing, fewer, men, to, crew, them, carronades, were, manufactured, in, the, usual, naval, gun, calibres, but, were, not, counted, in, a, ship, of, the, line, s, rated, number, of, guns, as, a, result, the, classification, of, royal, navy, vessels, in, this, period, can, be, misleading, as, they, often, carried, more, cannons, than, were, listed, cannons, were, crucial, in, napoleon, s, rise, to, power, and, continued, to, play, an, important, role, in, his, army, in, later, years, during, the, french, revolution, the, unpopularity, of, the, directory, led, to, riots, and, rebellions, when, over, 25, 000, royalists, led, by, general, danican, assaulted, paris, paul, barras, was, appointed, to, defend, the, capital, outnumbered, five, to, one, and, disorganised, the, republicans, were, desperate, when, napoleon, arrived, he, reorganised, the, defences, but, realised, that, without, cannons, the, city, could, not, be, held, he, ordered, joachim, murat, to, bring, the, guns, from, the, sablons, artillery, park, the, major, and, his, cavalry, fought, their, way, to, the, recently, captured, cannons, and, brought, them, back, to, napoleon, when, danican, s, poorly, trained, men, attacked, on, 13, vend, miaire, 1795, 5, october, in, the, calendar, used, in, france, at, the, time, napoleon, ordered, his, cannon, to, fire, grapeshot, into, the, mob, an, act, that, became, known, as, the, whiff, of, grapeshot, the, slaughter, effectively, ended, the, threat, to, the, new, government, while, at, the, same, time, making, bonaparte, a, famous, and, popular, public, figure, among, the, first, generals, to, recognise, that, artillery, was, not, being, used, to, its, full, potential, napoleon, often, massed, his, cannon, into, batteries, and, introduced, several, changes, into, the, french, artillery, improving, it, significantly, and, making, it, among, the, finest, in, europe, such, tactics, were, successfully, used, by, the, french, for, example, at, the, battle, of, friedland, when, 66, guns, fired, a, total, of, 3, 000, roundshot, and, 500, rounds, of, grapeshot, inflicting, severe, casualties, to, the, russian, forces, whose, losses, numbered, over, 20, 000, killed, and, wounded, in, total, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, napoleon, s, final, battle, the, french, army, had, many, more, artillery, pieces, than, either, the, british, or, prussians, as, the, battlefield, was, muddy, recoil, caused, cannons, to, bury, themselves, into, the, ground, after, firing, resulting, in, slow, rates, of, fire, as, more, effort, was, required, to, move, them, back, into, an, adequate, firing, position, also, roundshot, did, not, ricochet, with, as, much, force, from, the, wet, earth, despite, the, drawbacks, sustained, artillery, fire, proved, deadly, during, the, engagement, especially, during, the, french, cavalry, attack, the, british, infantry, having, formed, infantry, squares, took, heavy, losses, from, the, french, guns, while, their, own, cannons, fired, at, the, cuirassiers, and, lancers, when, they, fell, back, to, regroup, eventually, the, french, ceased, their, assault, after, taking, heavy, losses, from, the, british, cannon, and, musket, fire, in, the, 1810s, and, 1820s, greater, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, accuracy, of, long, range, gunfire, and, less, on, the, weight, of, a, broadside, around, 1822, george, marshall, wrote, marshall, s, practical, marine, gunnery, the, book, was, used, by, cannon, operators, in, the, united, states, navy, throughout, the, 19th, century, it, listed, all, the, types, of, cannons, and, instructions, the, carronade, although, initially, very, successful, and, widely, adopted, disappeared, from, the, royal, navy, in, the, 1850s, after, the, development, of, wrought, iron, jacketed, steel, cannon, by, william, armstrong, and, joseph, whitworth, nevertheless, carronades, were, used, in, the, american, civil, war, western, cannons, during, the, 19th, century, became, larger, more, destructive, more, accurate, and, could, fire, at, longer, range, one, example, is, the, american, 3, inch, 76, mm, wrought, iron, muzzle, loading, rifle, or, griffen, gun, usually, called, the, 3, inch, ordnance, rifle, used, during, the, american, civil, war, which, had, an, effective, range, of, over, 1, 1, mi, 1, 8, km, another, is, the, smoothbore, 12, pounder, napoleon, which, originated, in, france, in, 1853, and, was, widely, used, by, both, sides, in, the, american, civil, war, this, cannon, was, renowned, for, its, sturdiness, reliability, firepower, flexibility, relatively, lightweight, and, range, of, 1, 700, m, 5, 600, ft, the, practice, of, rifling, casting, spiralling, lines, inside, the, cannon, s, barrel, was, applied, to, artillery, more, frequently, by, 1855, as, it, gave, cannon, projectiles, gyroscopic, stability, which, improved, their, accuracy, one, of, the, earliest, rifled, cannons, was, the, breech, loading, armstrong, gun, also, invented, by, william, armstrong, which, boasted, significantly, improved, range, accuracy, and, power, than, earlier, weapons, the, projectile, fired, from, the, armstrong, gun, could, reportedly, pierce, through, a, ship, s, side, and, explode, inside, the, enemy, vessel, causing, increased, damage, and, casualties, the, british, military, adopted, the, armstrong, gun, and, was, impressed, the, duke, of, cambridge, even, declared, that, it, could, do, everything, but, speak, despite, being, significantly, more, advanced, than, its, predecessors, the, armstrong, gun, was, rejected, soon, after, its, integration, in, favour, of, the, muzzle, loading, pieces, that, had, been, in, use, before, while, both, types, of, gun, were, effective, against, wooden, ships, neither, had, the, capability, to, pierce, the, armour, of, ironclads, due, to, reports, of, slight, problems, with, the, breeches, of, the, armstrong, gun, and, their, higher, cost, the, older, muzzle, loaders, were, selected, to, remain, in, service, instead, realising, that, iron, was, more, difficult, to, pierce, with, breech, loaded, cannons, armstrong, designed, rifled, muzzle, loading, guns, which, proved, successful, the, times, reported, even, the, fondest, believers, in, the, invulnerability, of, our, present, ironclads, were, obliged, to, confess, that, against, such, artillery, at, such, ranges, their, plates, and, sides, were, almost, as, penetrable, as, wooden, ships, the, superior, cannon, of, the, western, world, brought, them, tremendous, advantages, in, warfare, for, example, in, the, first, opium, war, in, china, during, the, 19th, century, british, battleships, bombarded, the, coastal, areas, and, fortifications, from, afar, safe, from, the, reach, of, the, chinese, cannons, similarly, the, shortest, war, in, recorded, history, the, anglo, zanzibar, war, of, 1896, was, brought, to, a, swift, conclusion, by, shelling, from, british, cruisers, the, cynical, attitude, towards, recruited, infantry, in, the, face, of, ever, more, powerful, field, artillery, is, the, source, of, the, term, cannon, fodder, first, used, by, fran, ois, ren, de, chateaubriand, in, 1814, however, the, concept, of, regarding, soldiers, as, nothing, more, than, food, for, powder, was, mentioned, by, william, shakespeare, as, early, as, 1598, in, henry, iv, part, 1, cannons, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, are, usually, divided, into, sub, categories, and, given, separate, names, some, of, the, most, widely, used, types, of, modern, cannon, are, howitzers, mortars, guns, and, autocannon, although, a, few, very, large, calibre, cannon, custom, designed, have, also, been, constructed, nuclear, artillery, was, experimented, with, but, was, abandoned, as, impractical, modern, artillery, is, used, in, a, variety, of, roles, depending, on, its, type, according, to, nato, the, general, role, of, artillery, is, to, provide, fire, support, which, is, defined, as, the, application, of, fire, coordinated, with, the, manoeuvre, of, forces, to, destroy, neutralize, or, suppress, the, enemy, when, referring, to, cannons, the, term, gun, is, often, used, incorrectly, in, military, usage, a, gun, is, a, cannon, with, a, high, muzzle, velocity, and, a, flat, trajectory, useful, for, hitting, the, sides, of, targets, such, as, walls, as, opposed, to, howitzers, or, mortars, which, have, lower, muzzle, velocities, and, fire, indirectly, lobbing, shells, up, and, over, obstacles, to, hit, the, target, from, above, by, the, early, 20th, century, infantry, weapons, had, become, more, powerful, forcing, most, artillery, away, from, the, front, lines, despite, the, change, to, indirect, fire, cannons, proved, highly, effective, during, world, war, i, directly, or, indirectly, causing, over, 75, of, casualties, the, onset, of, trench, warfare, after, the, first, few, months, of, world, war, i, greatly, increased, the, demand, for, howitzers, as, they, were, more, suited, to, hitting, targets, in, trenches, furthermore, their, shells, carried, more, explosives, than, those, of, guns, and, caused, considerably, less, barrel, wear, the, german, army, had, the, advantage, here, as, they, began, the, war, with, many, more, howitzers, than, the, french, world, war, i, also, saw, the, use, of, the, paris, gun, the, longest, ranged, gun, ever, fired, this, 200, mm, 8, in, calibre, gun, was, used, by, the, germans, against, paris, and, could, hit, targets, more, than, 122, km, 76, mi, away, the, second, world, war, sparked, new, developments, in, cannon, technology, among, them, were, sabot, rounds, hollow, charge, projectiles, and, proximity, fuses, all, of, which, increased, the, effectiveness, of, cannon, against, specific, targets, the, proximity, fuse, emerged, on, the, battlefields, of, europe, in, late, december, 1944, used, to, great, effect, in, anti, aircraft, projectiles, proximity, fuses, were, fielded, in, both, the, european, and, pacific, theatres, of, operations, they, were, particularly, useful, against, v, 1, flying, bombs, and, kamikaze, planes, although, widely, used, in, naval, warfare, and, in, anti, air, guns, both, the, british, and, americans, feared, unexploded, proximity, fuses, would, be, reverse, engineered, leading, to, them, limiting, their, use, in, continental, battles, during, the, battle, of, the, bulge, however, the, fuses, became, known, as, the, american, artillery, s, christmas, present, for, the, german, army, because, of, their, effectiveness, against, german, personnel, in, the, open, when, they, frequently, dispersed, attacks, anti, tank, guns, were, also, tremendously, improved, during, the, war, in, 1939, the, british, used, primarily, 2, pounder, and, 6, pounder, guns, by, the, end, of, the, war, 17, pounders, had, proven, much, more, effective, against, german, tanks, and, 32, pounders, had, entered, development, meanwhile, german, tanks, were, continuously, upgraded, with, better, main, guns, in, addition, to, other, improvements, for, example, the, panzer, iii, was, originally, designed, with, a, 37, mm, gun, but, was, mass, produced, with, a, 50, mm, cannon, to, counter, the, threat, of, the, russian, t, 34s, another, more, powerful, 50, mm, gun, was, introduced, only, to, give, way, to, a, larger, 75, mm, cannon, which, was, in, a, fixed, mount, as, the, stug, iii, the, most, produced, german, world, war, ii, armoured, fighting, vehicle, of, any, type, despite, the, improved, guns, production, of, the, panzer, iii, was, ended, in, 1943, as, the, tank, still, could, not, match, the, t, 34, and, was, replaced, by, the, panzer, iv, and, panther, tanks, in, 1944, the, 8, 8, cm, kwk, 43, and, many, variations, entered, service, with, the, wehrmacht, and, was, used, as, both, a, tank, main, gun, and, as, the, pak, 43, anti, tank, gun, one, of, the, most, powerful, guns, to, see, service, in, world, war, ii, it, was, capable, of, destroying, any, allied, tank, at, very, long, ranges, despite, being, designed, to, fire, at, trajectories, with, a, steep, angle, of, descent, howitzers, can, be, fired, directly, as, was, done, by, the, 11th, marine, regiment, at, the, battle, of, chosin, reservoir, during, the, korean, war, two, field, batteries, fired, directly, upon, a, battalion, of, chinese, infantry, the, marines, were, forced, to, brace, themselves, against, their, howitzers, as, they, had, no, time, to, dig, them, in, the, chinese, infantry, took, heavy, casualties, and, were, forced, to, retreat, the, tendency, to, create, larger, calibre, cannons, during, the, world, wars, has, reversed, since, the, united, states, army, for, example, sought, a, lighter, more, versatile, howitzer, to, replace, their, aging, pieces, as, it, could, be, towed, the, m198, was, selected, to, be, the, successor, to, the, world, war, ii, era, cannons, used, at, the, time, and, entered, service, in, 1979, still, in, use, today, the, m198, is, in, turn, being, slowly, replaced, by, the, m777, ultralightweight, howitzer, which, weighs, nearly, half, as, much, and, can, be, more, easily, moved, although, land, based, artillery, such, as, the, m198, are, powerful, long, ranged, and, accurate, naval, guns, have, not, been, neglected, despite, being, much, smaller, than, in, the, past, and, in, some, cases, having, been, replaced, by, cruise, missiles, however, the, zumwalt, class, destroyer, s, planned, armament, included, the, advanced, gun, system, ags, a, pair, of, 155, mm, guns, which, fire, the, long, range, land, attack, projectile, the, warhead, which, weighed, 24, pounds, 11, kg, had, a, circular, error, of, probability, of, 50, m, 160, ft, and, was, mounted, on, a, rocket, to, increase, the, effective, range, to, 100, nmi, 190, km, further, than, that, of, the, paris, gun, the, ags, s, barrels, would, be, water, cooled, and, fire, 10, rounds, per, minute, per, gun, the, combined, firepower, from, both, turrets, would, give, a, zumwalt, class, destroyer, the, firepower, equivalent, to, 12, conventional, m198, howitzers, the, reason, for, the, re, integration, of, cannons, as, a, main, armament, in, united, states, navy, ships, was, because, satellite, guided, munitions, fired, from, a, gun, would, be, less, expensive, than, a, cruise, missile, but, have, a, similar, guidance, capability, autocannons, have, an, automatic, firing, mode, similar, to, that, of, a, machine, gun, they, have, mechanisms, to, automatically, load, their, ammunition, and, therefore, have, a, higher, rate, of, fire, than, artillery, often, approaching, or, in, the, case, of, rotary, autocannons, even, surpassing, the, firing, rate, of, a, machine, gun, while, there, is, no, minimum, bore, for, autocannons, they, are, generally, larger, than, machine, guns, typically, 20, mm, or, greater, since, world, war, ii, and, are, usually, capable, of, using, explosive, ammunition, even, if, it, is, not, always, used, machine, guns, in, contrast, are, usually, too, small, to, use, explosive, ammunition, such, ammunition, is, additionally, banned, in, international, conflict, for, the, parties, to, the, saint, petersburg, declaration, of, 1868, most, nations, use, rapid, fire, cannon, on, light, vehicles, replacing, a, more, powerful, but, heavier, tank, gun, a, typical, autocannon, is, the, 25, mm, bushmaster, chain, gun, mounted, on, the, lav, 25, and, m2, bradley, armoured, vehicles, autocannons, may, be, capable, of, a, very, high, rate, of, fire, but, ammunition, is, heavy, and, bulky, limiting, the, amount, carried, for, this, reason, both, the, 25, mm, bushmaster, and, the, 30, mm, rarden, are, deliberately, designed, with, relatively, low, rates, of, fire, the, typical, rate, of, fire, for, a, modern, autocannon, ranges, from, 90, to, 1, 800, rounds, per, minute, systems, with, multiple, barrels, such, as, a, rotary, autocannon, can, have, rates, of, fire, of, several, thousand, rounds, per, minute, the, fastest, of, these, is, the, gsh, 6, 23, which, has, a, rate, of, fire, of, over, 10, 000, rounds, per, minute, autocannons, are, often, found, in, aircraft, where, they, replaced, machine, guns, and, as, shipboard, anti, aircraft, weapons, as, they, provide, greater, destructive, power, than, machine, guns, the, first, documented, installation, of, a, cannon, on, an, aircraft, was, on, the, voisin, canon, in, 1911, displayed, at, the, paris, exposition, that, year, by, world, war, i, all, of, the, major, powers, were, experimenting, with, aircraft, mounted, cannons, however, their, low, rate, of, fire, and, great, size, and, weight, precluded, any, of, them, from, being, anything, other, than, experimental, the, most, successful, or, least, unsuccessful, was, the, spad, 12, ca, 1, with, a, single, 37, mm, puteaux, mounted, to, fire, between, the, cylinder, banks, and, through, the, propeller, boss, of, the, aircraft, s, hispano, suiza, 8c, the, pilot, by, necessity, an, ace, had, to, manually, reload, each, round, the, first, autocannon, were, developed, during, world, war, i, as, anti, aircraft, guns, and, one, of, these, the, coventry, ordnance, works, cow, 37, mm, gun, was, installed, in, an, aircraft, however, the, war, ended, before, it, could, be, given, a, field, trial, and, it, never, became, standard, equipment, in, a, production, aircraft, later, trials, had, it, fixed, at, a, steep, angle, upwards, in, both, the, vickers, type, 161, and, the, westland, c, o, w, gun, fighter, an, idea, that, would, return, later, during, this, period, autocannons, became, available, and, several, fighters, of, the, german, luftwaffe, and, the, imperial, japanese, navy, air, service, were, fitted, with, 20, mm, cannons, they, continued, to, be, installed, as, an, adjunct, to, machine, guns, rather, than, as, a, replacement, as, the, rate, of, fire, was, still, too, low, and, the, complete, installation, too, heavy, there, was, a, some, debate, in, the, raf, as, to, whether, the, greater, number, of, possible, rounds, being, fired, from, a, machine, gun, or, a, smaller, number, of, explosive, rounds, from, a, cannon, was, preferable, improvements, during, the, war, in, regards, to, rate, of, fire, allowed, the, cannon, to, displace, the, machine, gun, almost, entirely, the, cannon, was, more, effective, against, armour, so, they, were, increasingly, used, during, the, course, of, world, war, ii, and, newer, fighters, such, as, the, hawker, tempest, usually, carried, two, or, four, versus, the, six, 50, browning, machine, guns, for, us, aircraft, or, eight, to, twelve, m1919, browning, machine, guns, on, earlier, british, aircraft, the, hispano, suiza, hs, 404, oerlikon, 20, mm, cannon, mg, ff, and, their, numerous, variants, became, among, the, most, widely, used, autocannon, in, the, war, cannons, as, with, machine, guns, were, generally, fixed, to, fire, forwards, mounted, in, the, wings, in, the, nose, or, fuselage, or, in, a, pannier, under, either, or, were, mounted, in, gun, turrets, on, heavier, aircraft, both, the, germans, and, japanese, mounted, cannons, to, fire, upwards, and, forwards, for, use, against, heavy, bombers, with, the, germans, calling, guns, so, installed, schr, ge, musik, this, term, derives, from, a, german, colloquialism, for, jazz, music, schr, g, means, off, key, preceding, the, vietnam, war, the, high, speeds, aircraft, were, attaining, led, to, a, move, to, remove, the, cannon, due, to, the, mistaken, belief, that, they, would, be, useless, in, a, dogfight, but, combat, experience, during, the, vietnam, war, showed, conclusively, that, despite, advances, in, missiles, there, was, still, a, need, for, them, nearly, all, modern, fighter, aircraft, are, armed, with, an, autocannon, and, they, are, also, commonly, found, on, ground, attack, aircraft, one, of, the, most, powerful, examples, is, the, 30mm, gau, 8, a, avenger, gatling, type, rotary, cannon, mounted, exclusively, on, the, fairchild, republic, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, the, lockheed, ac, 130, gunship, a, converted, transport, can, carry, a, 105, mm, howitzer, as, well, as, a, variety, of, autocannons, ranging, up, to, 40, mm, both, are, used, in, the, close, air, support, role, cannons, in, general, have, the, form, of, a, truncated, cone, with, an, internal, cylindrical, bore, for, holding, an, explosive, charge, and, a, projectile, the, thickest, strongest, and, closed, part, of, the, cone, is, located, near, the, explosive, charge, as, any, explosive, charge, will, dissipate, in, all, directions, equally, the, thickest, portion, of, the, cannon, is, useful, for, containing, and, directing, this, force, the, backward, motion, of, the, cannon, as, its, projectile, leaves, the, bore, is, termed, its, recoil, and, the, effectiveness, of, the, cannon, can, be, measured, in, terms, of, how, much, this, response, can, be, diminished, though, obviously, diminishing, recoil, through, increasing, the, overall, mass, of, the, cannon, means, decreased, mobility, field, artillery, cannon, in, europe, and, the, americas, were, initially, made, most, often, of, bronze, though, later, forms, were, constructed, of, cast, iron, and, eventually, steel, 61, bronze, has, several, characteristics, that, made, it, preferable, as, a, construction, material, although, it, is, relatively, expensive, does, not, always, alloy, well, and, can, result, in, a, final, product, that, is, spongy, about, the, bore, 61, bronze, is, more, flexible, than, iron, and, therefore, less, prone, to, bursting, when, exposed, to, high, pressure, cast, iron, cannon, are, less, expensive, and, more, durable, generally, than, bronze, and, withstand, being, fired, more, times, without, deteriorating, however, cast, iron, cannon, have, a, tendency, to, burst, without, having, shown, any, previous, weakness, or, wear, and, this, makes, them, more, dangerous, to, operate, the, older, and, more, stable, forms, of, cannon, were, muzzle, loading, as, opposed, to, breech, loading, to, be, used, they, had, to, have, their, ordnance, packed, down, the, bore, through, the, muzzle, rather, than, inserted, through, the, breech, the, following, terms, refer, to, the, components, or, aspects, of, a, classical, western, cannon, c, 1850, as, illustrated, here, 66, in, what, follows, the, words, near, close, and, behind, will, refer, to, those, parts, towards, the, thick, closed, end, of, the, piece, and, far, front, in, front, of, and, before, to, the, thinner, open, end, the, main, body, of, a, cannon, consists, of, three, basic, extensions, the, foremost, and, the, longest, is, called, the, chase, the, middle, portion, is, the, reinforce, and, the, closest, and, briefest, portion, is, the, cascabel, or, cascable, to, pack, a, muzzle, loading, cannon, first, gunpowder, is, poured, down, the, bore, this, is, followed, by, a, layer, of, wadding, often, nothing, more, than, paper, and, then, the, cannonball, itself, a, certain, amount, of, windage, in, this, case, meaning, that, the, bore, is, designed, slightly, wider, than, the, cannonball, allows, the, ball, to, fit, down, the, bore, though, the, greater, the, windage, the, less, efficient, the, propulsion, of, the, ball, when, the, gunpowder, is, ignited, to, fire, the, cannon, the, fuse, located, in, the, vent, is, lit, quickly, burning, down, to, the, gunpowder, which, then, explodes, violently, propelling, wadding, and, ball, down, the, bore, and, out, of, the, muzzle, a, small, portion, of, exploding, gas, also, escapes, through, the, vent, but, this, does, not, dramatically, affect, the, total, force, exerted, on, the, ball, any, large, smoothbore, muzzle, loading, gun, used, before, the, advent, of, breech, loading, rifled, guns, may, be, referred, to, as, a, cannon, though, once, standardised, names, were, assigned, to, different, sized, cannon, the, term, specifically, referred, to, a, gun, designed, to, fire, a, 42, pound, 19, kg, shot, as, distinct, from, a, demi, cannon, 32, pounds, 15, kg, culverin, 18, pounds, 8, 2, kg, or, demi, culverin, 9, pounds, 4, 1, kg, gun, in, this, context, specifically, refers, to, a, type, of, cannon, that, fires, projectiles, at, high, speeds, and, usually, at, relatively, low, angles, they, have, been, used, in, warships, and, as, field, artillery, the, term, cannon, is, also, used, for, autocannon, a, modern, repeating, weapon, firing, explosive, projectiles, cannon, have, been, used, extensively, in, fighter, aircraft, since, world, war, ii, in, the, 1770s, cannon, operation, worked, as, follows, each, cannon, would, be, manned, by, two, gunners, six, soldiers, and, four, officers, of, artillery, the, right, gunner, was, to, prime, the, piece, and, load, it, with, powder, and, the, left, gunner, would, fetch, the, powder, from, the, magazine, and, be, ready, to, fire, the, cannon, at, the, officer, s, command, on, each, side, of, the, cannon, three, soldiers, stood, to, ram, and, sponge, the, cannon, and, hold, the, ladle, the, second, soldier, on, the, left, was, tasked, with, providing, 50, bullets, before, loading, the, cannon, would, be, cleaned, with, a, wet, sponge, to, extinguish, any, smouldering, material, from, the, last, shot, fresh, powder, could, be, set, off, prematurely, by, lingering, ignition, sources, the, powder, was, added, followed, by, wadding, of, paper, or, hay, and, the, ball, was, placed, in, and, rammed, down, after, ramming, the, cannon, would, be, aimed, with, the, elevation, set, using, a, quadrant, and, a, plummet, at, 45, degrees, the, ball, had, the, utmost, range, about, ten, times, the, gun, s, level, range, any, angle, above, a, horizontal, line, was, called, random, shot, wet, sponges, were, used, to, cool, the, pieces, every, ten, or, twelve, rounds, during, the, napoleonic, wars, a, british, gun, team, consisted, of, five, gunners, to, aim, it, clean, the, bore, with, a, damp, sponge, to, quench, any, remaining, embers, before, a, fresh, charge, was, introduced, and, another, to, load, the, gun, with, a, bag, of, powder, and, then, the, projectile, the, fourth, gunner, pressed, his, thumb, on, the, vent, hole, to, prevent, a, draught, that, might, fan, a, flame, the, charge, loaded, the, fourth, would, prick, the, bagged, charge, through, the, vent, hole, and, fill, the, vent, with, powder, on, command, the, fifth, gunner, would, fire, the, piece, with, a, slow, match, friction, primers, replaced, slow, match, ignition, by, the, mid, 19th, century, when, a, cannon, had, to, be, abandoned, such, as, in, a, retreat, or, surrender, the, touch, hole, of, the, cannon, would, be, plugged, flush, with, an, iron, spike, disabling, the, cannon, at, least, until, metal, boring, tools, could, be, used, to, remove, the, plug, this, was, called, spiking, a, gun, was, said, to, be, honeycombed, when, the, surface, of, the, bore, had, cavities, or, holes, in, it, caused, by, corrosion, or, casting, defects, in, the, united, states, muzzleloading, cannons, made, before, 1899, and, replicas, that, are, unable, to, fire, fixed, ammunition, are, considered, antiques, they, are, not, subject, to, the, gun, control, act, of, 1968, or, national, firearms, act, of, 1934, they, may, be, subject, to, local, rules, in, some, jurisdictions, however, historically, logs, or, poles, have, been, used, as, decoys, to, mislead, the, enemy, as, to, the, strength, of, an, emplacement, the, quaker, gun, trick, was, used, by, colonel, william, washington, s, continental, army, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, in, 1780, approximately, 100, loyalists, surrendered, to, them, rather, than, face, bombardment, during, the, american, civil, war, quaker, guns, were, also, used, by, the, confederates, to, compensate, for, their, shortage, of, artillery, the, decoy, cannon, were, painted, black, at, the, muzzle, and, positioned, behind, fortifications, to, delay, union, attacks, on, those, positions, on, occasion, real, gun, carriages, were, used, to, complete, the, deception, cannon, sounds, have, sometimes, been, used, in, classical, pieces, with, a, military, theme, one, of, the, best, known, examples, is, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, s, 1812, overture, the, overture, is, to, be, performed, using, an, artillery, section, together, with, the, orchestra, resulting, in, noise, levels, high, enough, that, musicians, are, required, to, wear, ear, protection, the, cannon, fire, simulates, russian, artillery, bombardments, of, the, battle, of, borodino, a, critical, battle, in, napoleon, s, invasion, of, russia, whose, defeat, the, piece, celebrates, when, the, overture, was, first, performed, the, cannon, were, fired, by, an, electric, current, triggered, by, the, conductor, however, the, overture, was, not, recorded, with, real, cannon, fire, until, mercury, records, and, conductor, antal, dor, ti, s, 1958, recording, of, the, minnesota, orchestra, cannon, fire, is, also, frequently, used, in, presentations, of, the, 1812, on, american, independence, day, a, tradition, started, by, arthur, fiedler, of, the, boston, pops, in, 1974, the, hard, rock, band, ac, dc, used, cannon, in, their, song, for, those, about, to, rock, we, salute, you, and, in, live, shows, replica, napoleonic, cannon, and, pyrotechnics, were, used, to, perform, the, piece, a, recording, of, that, song, has, accompanied, the, firing, of, an, authentic, reproduction, of, a, m1857, 12, pounder, napoleon, during, columbus, blue, jackets, goal, celebrations, at, nationwide, arena, since, opening, night, of, the, 2007, 08, season, the, cannon, is, the, focal, point, of, the, team, s, alternate, logo, on, its, third, jerseys, cannons, have, been, fired, in, touchdown, celebrations, by, several, american, football, teams, including, the, san, diego, chargers, the, pittsburgh, steelers, used, one, only, during, the, 1962, campaign, but, discontinued, it, after, buddy, dial, was, startled, by, inadvertently, running, face, first, into, the, cannon, s, smoky, discharge, in, a, 42, 27, loss, to, the, dallas, cowboys, cannon, recovered, from, the, sea, are, often, extensively, damaged, from, exposure, to, salt, water, electrolytic, reduction, treatment, is, required, to, forestall, corrosion, the, cannon, is, then, washed, in, deionized, water, to, remove, the, electrolyte, and, is, treated, in, tannic, acid, which, prevents, further, rust, and, gives, the, metal, a, bluish, black, colour, cannon, on, display, may, be, protected, from, oxygen, and, moisture, by, a, wax, sealant, a, coat, of, polyurethane, may, also, be, painted, over, the, wax, sealant, to, prevent, the, cannon, from, attracting, dust
