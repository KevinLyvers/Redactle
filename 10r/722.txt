a, canoe, is, a, lightweight, narrow, water, vessel, typically, pointed, at, both, ends, and, open, on, top, propelled, by, one, or, more, seated, or, kneeling, paddlers, facing, the, direction, of, travel, and, using, paddles, in, british, english, the, term, canoe, can, also, refer, to, a, kayak, whereas, canoes, are, then, called, canadian, or, open, canoes, to, distinguish, them, from, kayaks, however, for, official, competition, purposes, the, american, distinction, between, a, kayak, and, a, canoe, is, almost, always, adopted, at, the, olympics, both, conventions, are, used, under, the, umbrella, terms, canoe, slalom, and, canoe, sprint, there, are, separate, events, for, canoes, and, kayaks, canoes, were, developed, in, cultures, all, over, the, world, including, some, designed, for, use, with, sails, or, outriggers, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, canoe, was, an, important, means, of, transport, for, exploration, and, trade, and, in, some, places, is, still, used, as, such, sometimes, with, the, addition, of, an, outboard, motor, where, the, canoe, played, a, key, role, in, history, such, as, the, northern, united, states, canada, and, new, zealand, it, remains, an, important, theme, in, popular, culture, for, instance, the, birch, bark, canoe, of, the, largely, birch, based, culture, of, the, first, nations, of, quebec, canada, and, north, america, provided, these, hunting, peoples, with, the, mobility, essential, to, this, way, of, life, canoes, are, now, widely, used, for, competition, indeed, canoeing, has, been, part, of, the, olympics, since, 1936, and, pleasure, such, as, racing, whitewater, touring, and, camping, freestyle, and, general, recreation, the, intended, use, of, the, canoe, dictates, its, hull, shape, length, and, construction, material, although, canoes, were, historically, dugouts, or, made, of, bark, on, a, wood, frame, construction, materials, later, evolved, to, canvas, on, a, wood, frame, then, to, aluminum, most, modern, canoes, are, made, of, molded, plastic, or, composites, such, as, fiberglass, or, those, incorporating, kevlar, or, graphite, the, word, canoe, came, into, english, from, the, french, word, casnouey, adopted, from, the, saint, lawrence, iroquoians, language, in, the, 1535, jacques, cartier, relations, translated, in, 1600, by, the, english, geographer, richard, hackluyt, many, peoples, have, made, dugout, canoes, throughout, history, carving, them, out, of, a, single, piece, of, wood, either, a, whole, trunk, or, a, slab, of, trunk, from, particularly, large, trees, dugout, canoes, go, back, to, ancient, times, the, dufuna, canoe, discovered, in, nigeria, dates, back, to, 8500, 8000, bc, the, pesse, canoe, discovered, in, the, netherlands, dates, back, to, 8200, 7600, bc, excavations, in, denmark, reveal, the, use, of, dugouts, and, paddles, during, the, erteb, lle, period, c, 5300, c, 3950, bc, canoes, played, a, vital, role, in, the, colonisation, of, the, pre, columbian, caribbean, as, they, were, the, only, means, of, reaching, the, caribbean, islands, from, mainland, south, america, around, 3500, bc, ancient, amerindian, groups, colonised, the, first, caribbean, islands, using, single, hulled, canoes, only, a, few, pre, columbian, caribbean, canoes, have, been, found, several, families, of, trees, could, have, been, used, to, construct, caribbean, canoes, including, woods, of, the, mahogany, family, meliaceae, such, as, the, cuban, mahogany, swietenia, mahagoni, that, can, grow, up, to, 30, 35, m, tall, and, the, red, cedar, cedrela, odorata, that, can, grow, up, to, 60, m, tall, as, well, as, the, ceiba, genus, malvacae, such, as, ceiba, pentandra, that, can, reach, 60, 70, m, in, height, it, is, likely, that, these, canoes, were, built, in, a, variety, of, sizes, ranging, from, fishing, canoes, holding, just, one, or, a, few, people, to, larger, ones, able, to, carry, as, many, as, a, few, dozen, and, could, have, been, used, to, reach, the, caribbean, islands, from, the, mainland, reports, by, historical, chroniclers, claim, to, have, witnessed, a, canoe, containing, 40, to, 50, caribs, when, it, came, out, to, trade, with, a, visiting, english, ship, there, is, still, much, dispute, regarding, the, use, of, sails, in, caribbean, canoes, some, archaeologists, doubt, that, oceanic, transportation, would, have, been, possible, without, the, use, of, sails, as, winds, and, currents, would, have, carried, the, canoes, off, course, however, no, evidence, of, a, sail, or, a, caribbean, canoe, that, could, have, made, use, of, a, sail, has, been, found, furthermore, no, historical, sources, mention, caribbean, canoes, with, sails, one, possibility, could, be, that, canoes, with, sails, were, initially, used, in, the, caribbean, but, later, abandoned, before, european, contact, this, however, seems, unlikely, as, long, distance, trade, continued, in, the, caribbean, even, after, the, prehistoric, colonisation, of, the, islands, hence, it, is, likely, that, early, caribbean, colonists, made, use, of, canoes, without, sails, native, american, groups, of, the, north, pacific, coast, made, dugout, canoes, in, a, number, of, styles, for, different, purposes, from, western, red, cedar, thuja, plicata, or, yellow, cedar, chamaecyparis, nootkatensis, depending, on, availability, different, styles, were, required, for, ocean, going, vessels, versus, river, boats, and, for, whale, hunting, versus, seal, hunting, versus, salmon, fishing, the, quinault, of, washington, state, built, shovel, nose, canoes, with, double, bows, for, river, travel, that, could, slide, over, a, logjam, without, needing, to, be, portaged, the, kootenai, of, the, canadian, province, of, british, columbia, made, sturgeon, nosed, canoes, from, pine, bark, designed, to, be, stable, in, windy, conditions, on, kootenay, lake, in, recent, years, first, nations, in, british, columbia, and, washington, state, have, been, revitalizing, the, ocean, going, canoe, tradition, beginning, in, the, 1980s, the, heiltsuk, and, haida, were, early, leaders, in, this, movement, the, paddle, to, expo, 86, in, vancouver, by, the, heiltsuk, and, the, 1989, paddle, to, seattle, by, multiple, native, american, tribes, on, the, occasion, of, washington, state, s, centennial, year, were, early, instances, of, this, in, 1993, a, large, number, of, canoes, paddled, from, up, and, down, the, coast, to, bella, bella, in, its, first, canoe, festival, qatuwas, the, revitalization, continued, and, tribal, journeys, began, with, trips, to, various, communities, held, in, most, years, australian, aboriginal, people, made, canoes, from, hollowed, out, tree, trunks, as, well, as, from, tree, bark, the, indigenous, people, of, the, amazon, commonly, used, hymenaea, fabaceae, trees, some, australian, aboriginal, peoples, made, bark, canoes, they, could, be, made, only, from, the, bark, of, certain, trees, usually, red, gum, or, box, gum, and, during, summer, after, cutting, the, outline, of, the, required, size, and, shape, a, digging, stick, was, used, to, cut, through, the, bark, to, the, hardwood, and, the, bark, was, then, slowly, prised, out, using, numerous, smaller, sticks, the, slab, of, bark, was, held, in, place, by, branches, or, handwoven, rope, and, after, separation, from, the, tree, lowered, to, the, ground, small, fires, would, then, be, lit, on, the, inside, of, the, bark, to, cause, the, bark, to, dry, out, and, curl, upwards, after, which, the, ends, could, be, pulled, together, and, stitched, with, hemp, and, plugged, with, mud, it, was, then, allowed, to, mature, with, frequent, applications, of, grease, and, ochre, the, remaining, tree, was, later, dubbed, a, canoe, tree, by, europeans, because, of, the, porosity, of, the, bark, these, bark, canoes, did, not, last, too, long, about, two, years, they, were, mainly, used, for, fishing, or, crossing, rivers, and, lakes, to, avoid, long, journeys, they, were, usually, propelled, by, punting, with, a, long, stick, another, type, of, bark, canoe, was, made, out, of, a, type, of, stringybark, gum, known, as, messmate, stringybark, eucalyptus, obliqua, pleating, the, bark, and, tying, it, at, each, end, with, a, framework, of, cross, ties, and, ribs, this, type, was, known, as, a, pleated, or, tied, bark, canoe, bark, strips, could, also, be, sewn, together, to, make, larger, canoes, known, as, sewn, bark, canoes, many, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, built, bark, canoes, they, were, usually, skinned, with, birch, bark, over, a, light, wooden, frame, but, other, types, could, be, used, if, birch, was, scarce, at, a, typical, length, of, 4, 3, m, 14, ft, and, weight, of, 23, kg, 50, lb, the, canoes, were, light, enough, to, be, portaged, yet, could, carry, a, lot, of, cargo, even, in, shallow, water, although, susceptible, to, damage, from, rocks, they, are, easily, repaired, their, performance, qualities, were, soon, recognized, by, early, european, settler, colonials, and, canoes, played, a, key, role, in, the, exploration, of, north, america, with, samuel, de, champlain, canoeing, as, far, as, the, georgian, bay, in, 1615, in, 1603, a, canoe, was, brought, to, sir, robert, cecil, s, house, in, london, and, rowed, on, the, thames, by, virginian, indians, from, tsenacommacah, in, 1643, david, pietersz, de, vries, recorded, a, mohawk, canoe, in, dutch, possession, at, rensselaerswyck, capable, of, transporting, 225, bushels, of, maize, ren, de, br, hant, de, galin, e, a, french, missionary, who, explored, the, great, lakes, in, 1669, declared, the, convenience, of, these, canoes, is, great, in, these, waters, full, of, cataracts, or, waterfalls, and, rapids, through, which, it, is, impossible, to, take, any, boat, when, you, reach, them, you, load, canoe, and, baggage, upon, your, shoulders, and, go, overland, until, the, navigation, is, good, and, then, you, put, your, canoe, back, into, the, water, and, embark, again, american, painter, author, and, traveler, george, catlin, wrote, that, the, bark, canoe, was, the, most, beautiful, and, light, model, of, all, the, water, crafts, that, ever, were, invented, the, first, explorer, to, cross, the, north, american, continent, alexander, mackenzie, used, canoes, extensively, as, did, david, thompson, and, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, in, the, north, american, fur, trade, the, hudson, s, bay, company, s, voyageurs, used, three, types, of, canoe, the, birch, bark, canoe, was, used, in, a, 6, 500, kilometre, 4, 000, mi, supply, route, from, montreal, to, the, pacific, ocean, and, the, mackenzie, river, and, continued, to, be, used, up, to, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, indigenous, peoples, of, eastern, canada, and, the, northeast, united, states, made, canoes, using, the, bark, of, the, paper, birch, which, was, harvested, in, early, spring, by, stripping, off, the, bark, in, one, piece, using, wooden, wedges, next, the, two, ends, stem, and, stern, were, sewn, together, and, made, watertight, with, the, pitch, of, balsam, fir, the, ribs, of, the, canoe, called, verons, in, canadian, french, were, made, of, white, cedar, and, the, hull, ribs, and, thwarts, were, fastened, using, watap, a, binding, usually, made, from, the, roots, of, various, species, of, conifers, such, as, the, white, spruce, black, spruce, or, cedar, and, caulked, with, pitch, skin, canoes, are, constructed, using, animal, skins, stretched, over, a, framework, examples, include, the, kayak, and, umiak, in, 19th, century, north, america, the, birch, on, frame, construction, technique, evolved, into, the, wood, and, canvas, canoes, made, by, fastening, an, external, waterproofed, canvas, shell, to, planks, and, ribs, by, boat, builders, such, as, old, town, canoe, e, m, white, canoe, peterborough, canoe, company, and, at, the, chestnut, canoe, company, in, new, brunswick, though, similar, to, bark, canoes, in, the, use, of, ribs, and, a, waterproof, covering, the, construction, method, is, different, being, built, by, bending, ribs, over, a, solid, mold, once, removed, from, the, mold, the, decks, thwarts, and, seats, are, installed, and, canvas, is, stretched, tightly, over, the, hull, the, canvas, is, then, treated, with, a, combination, of, varnishes, and, paints, to, render, it, more, durable, and, watertight, although, canoes, were, once, primarily, a, means, of, transport, with, industrialization, they, became, popular, as, recreational, or, sporting, watercraft, john, macgregor, popularized, canoeing, through, his, books, founding, the, royal, canoe, club, in, london, in, 1866, and, the, american, canoe, association, in, 1880, the, canadian, canoe, association, was, founded, in, 1900, and, the, british, canoe, union, in, 1936, sprint, canoe, was, a, demonstration, sport, at, the, 1924, paris, olympics, and, became, an, olympic, discipline, at, the, 1936, berlin, olympics, when, the, international, canoe, federation, was, formed, in, 1946, it, became, the, umbrella, organization, of, all, national, canoe, organizations, worldwide, hull, design, must, meet, different, often, conflicting, requirements, for, speed, carrying, capacity, maneuverability, and, stability, the, canoe, s, hull, speed, can, be, calculated, using, the, principles, of, ship, resistance, and, propulsion, folding, canoes, usually, consist, of, a, pvc, skin, around, an, aluminum, frame, inflatable, canoes, contain, no, rigid, frame, members, and, can, be, deflated, folded, and, stored, in, a, bag, the, more, durable, types, consist, of, an, abrasion, resistant, nylon, or, rubber, outer, shell, with, separate, pvc, air, chambers, for, the, two, side, tubes, and, the, floor, royalex, a, composite, material, comprising, an, outer, layer, of, vinyl, and, hard, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, plastic, abs, and, an, inner, layer, of, abs, foam, bonded, by, heat, treatment, was, another, plastic, alternative, for, canoes, until, 2014, as, a, canoe, material, royalex, is, lighter, more, resistant, to, uv, damage, and, more, rigid, and, has, greater, structural, memory, than, non, composite, plastics, such, as, polyethylene, canoes, made, of, royalex, are, however, more, expensive, than, canoes, made, from, aluminum, or, from, traditionally, molded, or, roto, molded, polyethylene, hulls, royalex, is, heavier, and, less, suited, for, high, performance, paddling, than, fiber, reinforced, composites, such, as, fiberglass, kevlar, or, graphite, roto, molded, polyethylene, is, a, cheaper, alternative, to, royalex, modern, canoes, are, generally, constructed, by, layering, a, fiber, material, inside, a, female, mold, fiberglass, is, the, most, common, material, used, in, manufacturing, canoes, fiberglass, is, not, expensive, can, be, molded, to, any, shape, and, is, easy, to, repair, kevlar, is, popular, with, paddlers, looking, for, a, light, durable, boat, that, will, not, be, taken, in, whitewater, fiberglass, and, kevlar, are, strong, but, lack, rigidity, carbon, fiber, is, used, in, racing, canoes, to, create, a, very, light, rigid, construction, usually, combined, with, kevlar, for, durability, boats, are, built, by, draping, the, cloth, in, a, mold, then, impregnating, it, with, a, liquid, resin, optionally, a, vacuum, process, can, be, used, to, remove, excess, resin, to, reduce, weight, a, gel, coat, on, the, outside, gives, a, smoother, appearance, with, stitch, and, glue, plywood, panels, are, stitched, together, to, form, a, hull, shape, and, the, seams, are, reinforced, with, fiber, reinforced, composites, and, varnished, a, cedar, strip, canoe, is, essentially, a, composite, canoe, with, a, cedar, core, usually, fiberglass, is, used, to, reinforce, the, canoe, since, it, is, clear, and, allows, a, view, of, the, cedar, before, the, invention, of, fiberglass, aluminum, was, the, standard, choice, for, whitewater, canoeing, due, to, its, value, and, strength, by, weight, this, material, was, once, more, popular, but, is, being, replaced, by, modern, lighter, materials, it, is, tough, durable, and, will, take, being, dragged, over, the, bottom, very, well, as, it, has, no, gel, or, polymer, outer, coating, which, would, make, it, subject, to, abrasion, the, hull, does, not, degrade, from, long, term, exposure, to, sunlight, and, extremes, of, hot, and, cold, do, not, affect, the, material, it, can, dent, is, difficult, to, repair, is, noisy, can, get, stuck, on, underwater, objects, and, requires, buoyancy, chambers, to, assist, in, keeping, the, canoe, afloat, in, a, capsize, in, canada, the, canoe, has, been, a, theme, in, history, and, folklore, and, is, a, symbol, of, canadian, identity, from, 1935, to, 1986, the, canadian, silver, dollar, depicted, a, canoe, with, the, northern, lights, in, the, background, the, chasse, galerie, is, a, french, canadian, tale, of, voyageurs, who, after, a, night, of, heavy, drinking, on, new, year, s, eve, at, a, remote, timber, camp, want, to, visit, their, sweethearts, some, 100, leagues, about, 400, km, away, since, they, have, to, be, back, in, time, for, work, the, next, morning, they, make, a, pact, with, the, devil, their, canoe, will, fly, through, the, air, on, condition, that, they, not, mention, god, s, name, or, touch, the, cross, of, any, church, steeple, as, they, fly, by, in, the, canoe, one, version, of, this, fable, ends, with, the, coup, de, gr, ce, when, still, high, in, the, sky, the, voyageurs, complete, the, hazardous, journey, but, the, canoe, overturns, so, the, devil, can, honour, the, pact, to, deliver, the, voyageurs, and, still, claim, their, souls, in, john, steinbeck, s, novella, the, pearl, set,

tripping, canoes, such, as, the, chestnut, prospector, and, old, town, tripper, derivates, are, touring, canoes, for, wilderness, trips, they, are, typically, made, of, heavier, and, tougher, materials, and, designed, with, the, ability, to, carry, large, amounts, of, gear, while, being, maneuverable, enough, for, rivers, with, some, whitewater, prospector, is, now, a, generic, name, for, derivates, of, the, chestnut, model, a, popular, type, of, wilderness, tripping, canoe, the, prospector, is, marked, by, a, shallow, arch, hull, with, a, relatively, large, amount, of, rocker, giving, optimal, balance, for, wilderness, tripping, over, lakes, and, rivers, with, some, rapids, a, touring, canoe, is, sometimes, covered, with, a, greatly, extended, deck, forming, a, cockpit, for, the, paddlers, a, cockpit, has, the, advantage, that, the, gunwales, can, be, made, lower, and, narrower, so, the, paddler, can, reach, the, water, more, easily, a, freestyle, canoe, is, specialized, for, whitewater, play, and, tricks, most, are, identical, to, short, flat, bottomed, kayak, playboats, except, for, their, internal, outfitting, the, paddler, kneels, and, uses, a, single, blade, canoe, paddle, playboating, is, a, discipline, of, whitewater, canoeing, where, the, paddler, performs, various, technical, moves, in, one, place, a, playspot, as, opposed, to, downriver, where, the, objective, is, to, travel, the, length, of, a, section, of, river, although, whitewater, canoeists, will, often, stop, and, play, en, route, specialized, canoes, known, as, playboats, can, be, used, a, square, stern, canoe, is, an, asymmetrical, canoe, with, a, squared, off, stern, for, the, mounting, of, an, outboard, motor, and, is, meant, for, lake, travel, or, fishing, since, mounting, a, rudder, on, the, square, stern, is, very, easy, such, canoes, often, are, adapted, for, sailing, a, canoe, launch, is, a, place, for, launching, canoes, similar, to, a, boat, launch, which, is, often, for, launching, larger, watercraft, canoe, launches, are, frequently, on, river, banks, or, beaches, canoe, launches, may, be, designated, on, maps, of, places, such, as, parks, or, nature, reserves
