the, bow, and, arrow, is, a, ranged, weapon, system, consisting, of, an, elastic, launching, device, bow, and, long, shafted, projectiles, arrows, humans, used, bows, and, arrows, for, hunting, and, aggression, long, before, recorded, history, and, the, practice, was, common, to, many, prehistoric, cultures, they, were, important, weapons, of, war, from, ancient, history, until, the, early, modern, period, where, they, were, rendered, increasingly, obsolete, by, the, development, of, the, more, powerful, and, accurate, firearms, today, bows, and, arrows, are, mostly, used, for, hunting, and, sports, archery, is, the, art, practice, or, skill, of, using, bows, to, shoot, arrows, a, person, who, shoots, arrows, with, a, bow, is, called, a, bowman, or, an, archer, someone, who, makes, bows, is, known, as, a, bowyer, someone, who, makes, arrows, is, a, fletcher, and, someone, who, manufactures, metal, arrowheads, is, an, arrowsmith, a, bow, consists, of, a, semi, rigid, but, elastic, arc, with, a, high, tensile, bowstring, joining, the, ends, of, the, two, limbs, of, the, bow, an, arrow, is, a, projectile, with, a, pointed, tip, and, a, long, shaft, with, stabilizer, fins, fletching, towards, the, back, with, a, narrow, notch, nock, at, the, very, end, to, contact, the, bowstring, to, load, an, arrow, for, shooting, nocking, an, arrow, the, archer, places, an, arrow, across, the, middle, of, the, bow, with, the, bowstring, in, the, arrow, s, nock, to, shoot, the, archer, holds, the, bow, at, its, center, with, one, hand, and, pulls, back, draws, the, arrow, and, the, bowstring, with, the, other, typically, the, dominant, hand, this, flexes, the, two, limbs, of, the, bow, rearwards, which, perform, the, function, of, a, pair, of, cantilever, springs, to, store, elastic, energy, typically, while, maintaining, the, draw, the, archer, aims, the, shot, intuitively, or, by, sighting, along, the, arrow, then, the, archer, releases, looses, the, draw, allowing, the, limbs, stored, energy, to, convert, into, kinetic, energy, transmitted, via, the, bowstring, to, the, arrow, propelling, it, to, fly, forward, with, high, velocity, a, container, or, bag, for, additional, arrows, for, quick, reloading, is, called, a, quiver, when, not, in, use, bows, are, generally, kept, unstrung, meaning, one, or, both, ends, of, the, bowstring, are, detached, from, the, bow, this, removes, all, residual, tension, on, the, bow, and, can, help, prevent, it, from, losing, strength, or, elasticity, over, time, many, bow, designs, also, let, it, straighten, out, more, completely, reducing, the, space, needed, to, store, the, bow, returning, the, bowstring, to, its, ready, to, use, position, is, called, stringing, the, bow, the, oldest, known, evidence, of, the, bow, and, arrow, comes, from, south, african, sites, such, as, sibudu, cave, where, likely, arrowheads, have, been, found, dating, from, approximately, 72, 000, 60, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, probable, arrowheads, found, outside, of, africa, were, discovered, in, 2020, in, fa, hien, cave, sri, lanka, they, have, been, dated, to, 48, 000, years, ago, bow, and, arrow, hunting, at, the, sri, lankan, site, likely, focused, on, monkeys, and, smaller, animals, such, as, squirrels, langley, says, remains, of, these, creatures, were, found, in, the, same, sediment, as, the, bone, points, small, stone, points, from, the, grotte, mandrin, in, southern, france, used, some, 54, 000, years, ago, have, damage, from, use, that, indicates, their, use, as, projectile, weapons, and, some, are, too, small, less, than, 10mm, across, as, the, base, for, any, practical, use, other, than, as, arrowheads, they, are, associated, with, possibly, the, first, groups, of, modern, humans, to, leave, africa, after, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, some, 12, 000, years, ago, the, use, of, the, bow, seems, to, have, spread, to, every, inhabited, region, except, for, australasia, and, most, of, oceania, the, earliest, definite, remains, of, bow, and, arrow, from, europe, are, possible, fragments, from, germany, found, at, mannheim, vogelstang, dated, 17, 500, 18, 000, years, ago, and, at, stellmoor, dated, 11, 000, years, ago, azilian, points, found, in, grotte, du, bichon, switzerland, alongside, the, remains, of, both, a, bear, and, a, hunter, with, flint, fragments, found, in, the, bear, s, third, vertebra, suggest, the, use, of, arrows, at, 13, 500, years, ago, at, the, site, of, nataruk, in, turkana, county, kenya, obsidian, bladelets, found, embedded, in, a, skull, and, within, the, thoracic, cavity, of, another, skeleton, suggest, the, use, of, stone, tipped, arrows, as, weapons, about, 10, 000, years, ago, the, oldest, extant, bows, in, one, piece, are, the, elm, holmegaard, bows, from, denmark, which, were, dated, to, 9, 000, bce, several, bows, from, holmegaard, denmark, date, 8, 000, years, ago, high, performance, wooden, bows, are, currently, made, following, the, holmegaard, design, the, stellmoor, bow, fragments, from, northern, germany, were, dated, to, about, 8, 000, bce, but, they, were, destroyed, in, hamburg, during, the, second, world, war, before, carbon, 14, dating, was, available, their, age, is, attributed, by, archaeological, association, the, bow, was, an, important, weapon, for, both, hunting, and, warfare, from, prehistoric, times, until, the, widespread, use, of, gunpowder, weapons, in, the, 16th, century, it, was, also, common, in, ancient, warfare, although, certain, cultures, would, not, favor, them, greek, poet, archilocus, expressed, scorn, for, fighting, with, bows, and, slings, the, skill, of, nubian, archers, was, renowned, in, ancient, egypt, and, beyond, their, mastery, of, the, bow, gained, their, land, the, name, ta, seti, land, of, the, bow, in, ancient, egyptian, beginning, with, the, reign, of, william, the, conqueror, the, longbow, was, england, s, principal, weapon, of, war, until, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, genghis, khan, and, his, mongol, hordes, conquered, much, of, the, eurasian, steppe, using, short, bows, native, americans, used, archery, to, hunt, and, defend, themselves, during, the, days, of, english, and, later, american, colonization, organised, warfare, with, bows, ended, in, the, early, to, mid, 17th, century, in, western, europe, but, it, persisted, into, the, 19th, century, in, eastern, cultures, including, hunting, and, warfare, in, the, new, world, in, the, canadian, arctic, bows, were, made, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, for, hunting, caribou, for, instance, at, igloolik, the, bow, has, more, recently, been, used, as, a, weapon, of, tribal, warfare, in, some, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, an, example, was, documented, in, 2009, in, kenya, when, kisii, people, and, kalenjin, people, clashed, resulting, in, four, deaths, the, british, upper, class, led, a, revival, of, archery, as, a, sport, in, the, late, 18th, century, sir, ashton, lever, an, antiquarian, and, collector, formed, the, toxophilite, society, in, london, in, 1781, under, the, patronage, of, george, iv, then, prince, of, wales, bows, and, arrows, have, been, rarely, used, by, modern, special, forces, for, survival, and, clandestine, operations, the, basic, elements, of, a, modern, bow, are, a, pair, of, curved, elastic, limbs, traditionally, made, from, wood, joined, by, a, riser, however, self, bows, such, as, the, english, longbow, are, made, of, a, single, piece, of, wood, comprising, both, limbs, and, the, grip, the, ends, of, each, limb, are, connected, by, a, string, known, as, the, bow, string, by, pulling, the, string, backwards, the, archer, exerts, compression, force, on, the, string, facing, section, or, belly, of, the, limbs, as, well, as, placing, the, outer, section, or, back, under, tension, while, the, string, is, held, this, stores, the, energy, later, released, in, putting, the, arrow, to, flight, the, force, required, to, hold, the, string, stationary, at, full, draw, is, often, used, to, express, the, power, of, a, bow, and, is, known, as, its, draw, weight, or, weight, other, things, being, equal, a, higher, draw, weight, means, a, more, powerful, bow, which, is, able, to, project, heavier, arrows, at, the, same, velocity, or, the, same, arrow, at, a, greater, velocity, the, various, parts, of, the, bow, can, be, subdivided, into, further, sections, the, topmost, limb, is, known, as, the, upper, limb, while, the, bottom, limb, is, the, lower, limb, at, the, tip, of, each, limb, is, a, nock, which, is, used, to, attach, the, bowstring, to, the, limbs, the, riser, is, usually, divided, into, the, grip, which, is, held, by, the, archer, as, well, as, the, arrow, rest, and, the, bow, window, the, arrow, rest, is, a, small, ledge, or, extension, above, the, grip, which, the, arrow, rests, upon, while, being, aimed, the, bow, window, is, that, part, of, the, riser, above, the, grip, which, contains, the, arrow, rest, in, bows, drawn, and, held, by, hand, the, maximum, draw, weight, is, determined, by, the, strength, of, the, archer, the, maximum, distance, the, string, could, be, displaced, and, thus, the, longest, arrow, that, could, be, loosed, from, it, a, bow, s, draw, length, is, determined, by, the, size, of, the, archer, a, composite, bow, uses, a, combination, of, materials, to, create, the, limbs, allowing, the, use, of, materials, specialized, for, the, different, functions, of, a, bow, limb, the, classic, composite, bow, uses, wood, for, lightness, and, dimensional, stability, in, the, core, horn, to, store, compression, energy, and, sinew, for, its, ability, to, store, energy, in, tension, such, bows, typically, asian, would, often, use, a, stiff, end, on, the, limb, end, having, the, effect, of, a, recurve, in, this, type, of, bow, this, is, known, by, the, arabic, name, siyah, modern, construction, materials, for, bows, include, laminated, wood, fiberglass, metals, and, carbon, fiber, components, an, arrow, usually, consists, of, a, shaft, with, an, arrowhead, attached, to, the, front, end, with, fletchings, and, a, nock, at, the, other, modern, arrows, are, usually, made, from, carbon, fibre, aluminum, fiberglass, and, wood, shafts, carbon, shafts, have, the, advantage, that, they, do, not, bend, or, warp, but, they, can, often, be, too, light, weight, to, shoot, from, some, bows, and, are, expensive, aluminum, shafts, are, less, expensive, than, carbon, shafts, but, they, can, bend, and, warp, from, use, wood, shafts, are, the, least, expensive, option, but, often, will, not, be, identical, in, weight, and, size, to, each, other, and, break, more, often, than, the, other, types, of, shafts, arrow, sizes, vary, greatly, across, cultures, and, range, from, very, short, ones, that, require, the, use, of, special, equipment, to, be, shot, to, ones, in, use, in, the, amazon, river, jungles, that, are, 2, 6, m, 8, 5, feet, long, most, modern, arrows, are, 55, to, 75, cm, 22, to, 30, inches, in, length, arrows, come, in, many, types, among, which, are, breasted, bob, tailed, barreled, clout, and, target, a, breasted, arrow, is, thickest, at, the, area, right, behind, the, fletchings, and, tapers, towards, the, nock, and, head, a, bob, tailed, arrow, is, thickest, right, behind, the, head, and, tapers, to, the, nock, a, barrelled, arrow, is, thickest, in, the, centre, of, the, arrow, target, arrows, are, those, arrows, used, for, target, shooting, rather, than, warfare, or, hunting, and, usually, have, simple, arrowheads, for, safety, reasons, a, bow, should, never, be, shot, without, an, arrow, nocked, without, an, arrow, the, energy, that, is, normally, transferred, into, the, projectile, is, instead, directed, back, into, the, bow, itself, which, will, cause, damage, to, the, bow, s, limbs, the, end, of, the, arrow, that, is, designed, to, hit, the, target, is, called, the, arrowhead, usually, these, are, separate, items, that, are, attached, to, the, arrow, shaft, by, either, tangs, or, sockets, materials, used, in, the, past, for, arrowheads, include, flint, bone, horn, or, metal, most, modern, arrowheads, are, made, of, steel, but, wood, and, other, traditional, materials, are, still, used, occasionally, a, number, of, different, types, of, arrowheads, are, known, with, the, most, common, being, bodkins, broadheads, and, piles, bodkin, heads, are, simple, spikes, made, of, metal, of, various, shapes, designed, to, pierce, armour, a, broadhead, arrowhead, is, usually, triangular, or, leaf, shaped, and, has, a, sharpened, edge, or, edges, broadheads, are, commonly, used, for, hunting, a, pile, arrowhead, is, a, simple, metal, cone, either, sharpened, to, a, point, or, somewhat, blunt, that, is, used, mainly, for, target, shooting, a, pile, head, is, the, same, diameter, as, the, arrow, shaft, and, is, usually, just, fitted, over, the, tip, of, the, arrow, other, heads, are, known, including, the, blunt, head, which, is, flat, at, the, end, and, is, used, for, hunting, small, game, or, birds, and, is, designed, to, not, pierce, the, target, nor, embed, itself, in, trees, or, other, objects, and, make, recovery, difficult, another, type, of, arrowhead, is, a, barbed, head, usually, used, in, warfare, or, hunting, bowstrings, may, have, a, nocking, point, marked, on, them, which, serves, to, mark, where, the, arrow, is, fitted, to, the, bowstring, before, shooting, the, area, around, the, nocking, point, is, usually, bound, with, thread, to, protect, the, area, around, the, nocking, point, from, wear, by, the, archer, s, hands, this, section, is, called, the, serving, at, one, end, of, the, bowstring, a, loop, is, formed, which, is, permanent, the, other, end, of, the, bowstring, also, has, a, loop, but, this, is, not, permanently, formed, into, the, bowstring, but, is, constructed, by, tying, a, knot, into, the, string, to, form, a, loop, traditionally, this, knot, is, known, as, the, archer, s, knot, but, is, a, form, of, the, timber, hitch, the, knot, can, be, adjusted, to, lengthen, or, shorten, the, bowstring, the, adjustable, loop, is, known, as, the, tail, the, string, is, often, twisted, this, being, called, the, flemish, twist, bowstrings, have, been, constructed, of, many, materials, throughout, history, including, fibres, such, as, flax, silk, and, hemp, other, materials, used, were, animal, guts, animal, sinews, and, rawhide, modern, fibres, such, as, dacron, or, kevlar, are, now, used, in, commercial, bowstring, construction, as, well, as, steel, wires, in, some, compound, bows, compound, bows, have, a, mechanical, system, of, pulley, cams, over, which, the, bowstring, is, wound, nylon, is, useful, only, in, emergency, situations, as, it, stretches, too, much, there, is, no, single, accepted, system, of, classification, of, bows, bows, may, be, described, by, various, characteristics, including, the, materials, used, the, length, of, the, draw, that, they, permit, the, shape, of, the, bow, in, sideways, view, and, the, shape, of, the, limb, in, cross, section, commonly, used, descriptors, for, bows, include
