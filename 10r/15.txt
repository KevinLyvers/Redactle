horses, are, kept, in, buildings, known, as, stables, in, mainland, europe, however, barns, were, often, part, of, integrated, structures, known, as, byre, dwellings, or, housebarns, in, us, literature, in, addition, barns, may, be, used, for, equipment, storage, as, a, covered, workplace, and, for, activities, such, as, threshing, the, word, barn, comes, from, the, old, english, bere, for, barley, or, grain, in, general, and, aern, for, a, storage, place, thus, a, storehouse, for, barley, the, word, bere, ern, also, spelled, bern, and, bearn, is, attested, to, at, least, sixty, times, in, homilies, and, other, old, english, prose, the, related, words, bere, tun, and, bere, flor, both, meant, threshing, floor, bere, tun, also, meant, granary, the, literal, translation, of,

tun, and, two, of, bere, flor, a, thesaurus, of, old, english, lists, bere, rn, and, melu, hudern, meal, store, house, as, synonyms, for, barn, the, modern, barn, largely, developed, from, the, three, aisled, medieval, barn, commonly, known, as, tithe, barn, or, monastic, barn, this, in, turn, originated, in, a, 12th, century, building, tradition, also, applied, in, halls, and, ecclesiastical, buildings, in, the, 15th, century, several, thousands, of, these, huge, barns, were, to, be, found, in, western, europe, in, the, course, of, time, its, construction, method, was, adopted, by, normal, farms, and, it, gradually, spread, to, simpler, buildings, and, other, rural, areas, as, a, rule, the, aisled, barn, had, large, entrance, doors, and, a, passage, corridor, for, loaded, wagons, the, storage, floors, between, the, central, posts, or, in, the, aisles, were, known, as, bays, or, mows, from, middle, french, moye, the, main, types, were, large, barns, with, sideway, passages, compact, barns, with, a, central, entrance, and, smaller, barns, with, a, transverse, passage, the, latter, also, spread, to, eastern, europe, whenever, stone, walls, were, applied, the, aisled, timber, frame, often, gave, way, to, single, naved, buildings, a, special, type, were, byre, dwellings, which, included, living, quarters, byres, and, stables, such, as, the, frisian, farmhouse, or, gulf, house, and, the, black, forest, house, not, all, however, evolved, from, the, medieval, barn, other, types, descended, from, the, prehistoric, longhouse, or, other, building, traditions, one, of, the, latter, was, the, low, german, hall, house, in, which, the, harvest, was, stored, in, the, attic, in, many, cases, the, new, world, colonial, barn, evolved, from, the, low, german, house, which, was, transformed, to, a, real, barn, by, first, generation, colonists, from, the, netherlands, and, germany, in, the, yorkshire, dales, england, barns, known, locally, as, cowhouses, were, built, from, double, stone, walls, with, truffs, or, throughstones, acting, as, wall, ties, in, the, u, s, older, barns, were, built, from, timbers, hewn, from, trees, on, the, farm, and, built, as, a, log, crib, barn, or, timber, frame, although, stone, barns, were, sometimes, built, in, areas, where, stone, was, a, cheaper, building, material, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, in, the, u, s, barn, framing, methods, began, to, shift, away, from, traditional, timber, framing, to, truss, framed, or, plank, framed, buildings, truss, or, plank, framed, barns, reduced, the, number, of, timbers, instead, using, dimensional, lumber, for, the, rafters, joists, and, sometimes, the, trusses, the, joints, began, to, become, bolted, or, nailed, instead, of, being, mortised, and, tenoned, the, inventor, and, patentee, of, the, jennings, barn, claimed, his, design, used, less, lumber, less, work, less, time, and, less, cost, to, build, and, were, durable, and, provided, more, room, for, hay, storage, mechanization, on, the, farm, better, transportation, infrastructure, and, new, technology, like, a, hay, fork, mounted, on, a, track, contributed, to, a, need, for, larger, more, open, barns, sawmills, using, steam, power, could, produce, smaller, pieces, of, lumber, affordably, and, machine, cut, nails, were, much, less, expensive, than, hand, made, wrought, nails, concrete, block, began, to, be, used, for, barns, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, u, s, modern, barns, are, more, typically, steel, buildings, from, about, 1900, to, 1940, many, large, dairy, barns, were, built, in, northern, usa, these, commonly, have, gambrel, or, hip, roofs, to, maximize, the, size, of, the, hay, loft, above, the, dairy, roof, and, have, become, associated, in, the, popular, image, of, a, dairy, farm, the, barns, that, were, common, to, the, wheatbelt, held, large, numbers, of, pulling, horses, such, as, clydesdales, or, percherons, these, large, wooden, barns, especially, when, filled, with, hay, could, make, spectacular, fires, that, were, usually, total, losses, for, the, farmers, with, the, advent, of, balers, it, became, possible, to, store, hay, and, straw, outdoors, in, stacks, surrounded, by, a, plowed, fireguard, many, barns, in, the, northern, united, states, are, painted, barn, red, with, a, white, trim, one, possible, reason, for, this, is, that, ferric, oxide, which, is, used, to, create, red, paint, was, the, cheapest, and, most, readily, available, chemical, for, farmers, in, new, england, and, nearby, areas, another, possible, reason, is, that, ferric, oxide, acts, a, preservative, and, so, painting, a, barn, with, it, would, help, to, protect, the, structure, the, custom, of, painting, barns, in, red, with, white, trim, is, widely, spread, in, scandinavia, especially, in, sweden, the, falu, red, with, white, trims, is, the, traditional, colouring, of, most, wooden, buildings, with, the, popularity, of, tractors, following, world, war, ii, many, barns, were, taken, down, or, replaced, with, modern, quonset, huts, made, of, plywood, or, galvanized, steel, beef, ranches, and, dairies, began, building, smaller, loftless, barns, often, of, quonset, huts, or, of, steel, walls, on, a, treated, wood, frame, old, telephone, or, power, poles, by, the, 1960s, it, was, found, that, cattle, receive, sufficient, shelter, from, trees, or, wind, fences, usually, wooden, slabs, 20, open, in, older, style, north, american, barns, the, upper, area, was, used, to, store, hay, and, sometimes, grain, this, is, called, the, mow, rhymes, with, cow, or, the, hayloft, a, large, door, at, the, top, of, the, ends, of, the, barn, could, be, opened, up, so, that, hay, could, be, put, in, the, loft, the, hay, was, hoisted, into, the, barn, by, a, system, containing, pulleys, and, a, trolley, that, ran, along, a, track, attached, to, the, top, ridge, of, the, barn, trap, doors, in, the, floor, allowed, animal, feed, to, be, dropped, into, the, mangers, for, the, animals, in, new, england, it, is, common, to, find, barns, attached, to, the, main, farmhouse, connected, farm, architecture, allowing, for, chores, to, be, done, while, sheltering, the, worker, from, the, weather, in, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, the, large, broad, roof, of, barns, were, sometimes, painted, with, slogans, in, the, united, states, most, common, of, these, were, the, 900, barns, painted, with, ads, for, rock, city, in, the, past, barns, were, often, used, for, communal, gatherings, such, as, barn, dances, a, farm, may, have, buildings, of, varying, shapes, and, sizes, used, to, shelter, large, and, small, animals, and, other, uses, the, enclosed, pens, used, to, shelter, large, animals, are, called, stalls, and, may, be, located, in, the, cellar, or, on, the, main, level, depending, in, the, type, of, barn, other, common, areas, or, features, of, an, american, barn, include, the, physics, term, barn, which, is, a, subatomic, unit, of, area, 10, 28, m, 2, came, from, experiments, with, uranium, nuclei, during, world, war, ii, wherein, they, were, described, colloquially, as, big, as, a, barn, with, the, measurement, officially, adopted, to, maintain, security, around, nuclear, weapons, research, barns, have, been, classified, by, their, function, structure, location, or, other, features, sometimes, the, same, building, falls, into, multiple, categories, old, farm, buildings, of, the, countryside, contribute, to, the, landscape, and, help, define, the, history, of, the, location, i, e, how, farming, took, place, in, the, past, and, how, the, area, has, been, settled, throughout, the, ages, they, also, can, show, the, agricultural, methods, building, materials, and, skills, that, were, used, most, were, built, with, materials, reflecting, the, local, geology, of, the, area, building, methods, include, earth, walling, and, thatching, buildings, in, stone, and, brick, roofed, with, tile, or, slate, increasingly, replaced, buildings, in, clay, timber, and, thatch, from, the, later, 18th, century, metal, roofs, started, to, be, used, from, the, 1850s, the, arrival, of, canals, and, railways, brought, about, transportation, of, building, materials, over, greater, distances, clues, determining, their, age, and, historical, use, can, be, found, from, old, maps, sale, documents, estate, plans, and, from, a, visual, inspection, of, the, building, itself, noting, for, example, reused, timbers, former, floors, partitions, doors, and, windows, the, arrangement, of, the, buildings, within, the, farmstead, can, also, yield, valuable, information, on, the, historical, farm, usage, and, landscape, value, linear, farmsteads, were, typical, of, small, farms, where, there, was, an, advantage, to, having, cattle, and, fodder, within, one, building, due, to, the, colder, climate, dispersed, clusters, of, unplanned, groups, were, more, widespread, loose, courtyard, plans, built, around, a, yard, were, associated, with, bigger, farms, whereas, carefully, laid, out, courtyard, plans, designed, to, minimize, waste, and, labour, were, built, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, the, barns, are, typically, the, oldest, and, biggest, buildings, to, be, found, on, the, farm, many, barns, were, converted, into, cow, houses, and, fodder, processing, and, storage, buildings, after, the, 1880s, many, barns, had, owl, holes, to, allow, for, access, by, barn, owls, encouraged, to, aid, vermin, control, the, stable, is, typically, the, second, oldest, building, type, on, the, farm, they, were, well, built, and, placed, near, the, house, due, to, the, value, that, the, horses, had, as, draught, animals, modern, granaries, were, built, from, the, 18th, century, complete, granary, interiors, with, plastered, walls, and, wooden, partitioning, to, grain, bins, are, very, rare, longhouses, are, an, ancient, building, where, people, and, animals, used, the, same, entrance, these, can, still, be, seen, for, example, in, north, germany, where, the, low, saxon, house, occurs, few, interiors, of, the, 19th, century, cow, houses, have, survived, unaltered, due, to, dairy, hygiene, regulations, in, many, countries, old, farm, buildings, may, show, the, following, signs, of, deterioration, rotting, in, timber, framed, constructions, due, to, damp, cracks, in, the, masonry, from, movement, of, the, walls, e, g, ground, movement, roofing, problems, e, g, outward, thrust, of, it, deterioration, of, purlins, and, gable, ends, foundation, problems, penetration, of, tree, roots, lime, mortar, being, washed, away, due, to, inadequate, weather, protection, walls, made, of, cob, earth, mortars, or, walls, with, rubble, cores, are, all, highly, vulnerable, to, water, penetration, and, replacement, or, covering, of, breathable, materials, with, cement, or, damp, proofing, materials, may, trap, moisture, within, the, walls, in, england, and, wales, some, of, these, historical, buildings, have, been, given, listed, building, status, which, provides, them, some, degree, of, archaeological, protection, some, grant, schemes,
