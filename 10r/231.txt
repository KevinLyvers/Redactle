pumping, stations, also, called, pumphouses, are, public, utility, buildings, containing, pumps, and, equipment, for, pumping, fluids, from, one, place, to, another, they, are, critical, in, a, variety, of, infrastructure, systems, such, as, water, supply, drainage, of, low, lying, land, canals, and, removal, of, sewage, to, processing, sites, a, pumping, station, is, an, integral, part, of, a, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, installation, pumping, stations, are, designed, to, move, water, or, sewage, from, one, location, to, another, overcoming, gravitational, challenges, and, are, essential, for, maintaining, navigable, canal, levels, supplying, water, and, managing, sewage, and, floodwaters, in, canal, systems, pumping, stations, help, replenish, water, lost, through, lock, usage, and, leakage, ensuring, navigability, similarly, in, land, drainage, stations, pump, water, to, prevent, flooding, in, areas, below, sea, level, a, concept, pioneered, during, the, victorian, era, in, places, like, the, fens, in, the, uk, the, introduction, of, package, pumping, stations, has, modernized, drainage, systems, allowing, a, compact, efficient, solution, for, areas, where, gravity, drainage, is, impractical, water, pumping, stations, are, differentiated, by, their, applications, such, as, sourcing, from, wells, raw, water, pumping, and, high, service, pumping, each, designed, to, meet, specific, demand, projections, and, customer, needs, wastewater, pumping, stations, on, the, other, hand, are, engineered, to, handle, sewage, with, designs, that, ensure, reliability, and, safety, minimizing, environmental, impacts, from, overflows, innovations, in, pump, technology, and, station, design, have, led, to, the, development, of, submersible, pump, stations, which, are, more, compact, and, safer, effectively, reducing, the, footprint, and, visibility, of, sewage, management, infrastructure, electronic, controllers, have, enhanced, the, efficiency, and, monitoring, capabilities, of, pumping, stations, essential, for, modern, systems, pumped, storage, schemes, represent, a, critical, use, of, pumping, stations, providing, a, method, for, energy, storage, and, generation, by, moving, water, between, reservoirs, at, different, elevations, highlighting, the, versatility, and, importance, of, pumping, stations, across, sectors, some, pumping, stations, have, been, recognized, for, their, architectural, and, historical, significance, e, g, the, claverton, and, crofton, pumping, stations, are, preserved, as, museum, attractions, examples, such, as, land, drainage, in, the, netherlands, water, supply, in, hong, kong, and, agricultural, drainage, in, iraq, underscore, the, vital, role, these, facilities, play, in, supporting, modern, infrastructure, environmental, management, and, energy, storage, in, countries, with, canal, systems, pumping, stations, are, also, frequent, because, of, the, way, the, system, of, canal, locks, work, water, is, lost, from, the, upper, part, of, a, canal, each, time, a, vessel, passes, through, also, most, lock, gates, are, not, watertight, so, some, water, leaks, from, the, higher, levels, of, the, canal, to, those, lower, down, the, water, has, to, be, replaced, or, eventually, the, upper, levels, of, the, canal, would, not, hold, enough, water, to, be, navigable, canals, are, usually, fed, by, diverting, water, from, streams, and, rivers, into, the, upper, parts, of, the, canal, but, if, no, suitable, source, is, available, a, pumping, station, can, be, used, to, maintain, the, water, level, an, example, of, a, canal, pumping, station, is, the, claverton, pumping, station, on, the, kennet, and, avon, canal, in, southern, england, united, kingdom, this, pumps, water, from, the, nearby, river, avon, to, the, canal, using, pumps, driven, by, a, waterwheel, which, is, powered, by, the, river, where, no, external, water, supply, is, available, back, pumping, systems, may, be, employed, water, is, extracted, from, the, canal, below, the, lowest, lock, of, a, flight, and, is, pumped, back, to, the, top, of, the, flight, ready, for, the, next, boat, to, pass, through, such, installations, are, usually, small, when, low, lying, areas, of, land, are, drained, the, general, method, is, to, dig, drainage, ditches, however, if, the, area, is, below, sea, level, then, it, is, necessary, to, pump, the, water, upwards, into, water, channels, that, finally, drain, into, the, sea, the, victorians, understood, this, concept, and, in, the, united, kingdom, they, built, pumping, stations, with, water, pumps, powered, by, steam, engines, to, accomplish, this, task, in, lincolnshire, large, areas, of, wetland, at, sea, level, called, the, fens, were, turned, into, rich, arable, farmland, by, this, method, the, land, is, full, of, nutrients, because, of, the, accumulation, of, sedimentary, mud, that, created, the, land, initially, elsewhere, pumping, stations, are, used, to, remove, water, that, has, found, its, way, into, low, lying, areas, as, a, result, of, leakage, or, flooding, in, new, orleans, for, example, in, more, recent, times, a, package, pumping, station, provides, an, efficient, and, economic, way, of, installing, a, drainage, system, they, are, suitable, for, mechanical, building, services, collection, and, pumping, of, liquids, like, surface, water, wastewater, or, sewage, from, areas, where, drainage, by, gravity, is, not, possible, a, package, pumping, station, is, an, integrated, system, built, in, a, housing, manufactured, from, strong, impact, resistant, materials, such, as, precast, concrete, polyethylene, or, glass, reinforced, plastic, the, unit, is, supplied, with, internal, pipework, fitted, pre, assembled, ready, for, installation, into, the, ground, after, which, the, submersible, pumps, and, control, equipment, are, fitted, features, may, include, controls, for, fully, automatic, operation, a, high, level, alarm, indication, in, the, event, of, pump, failure, and, possibly, a, guide, rail, auto, coupling, pedestal, system, to, permit, easy, removal, of, pumps, for, maintenance, traditional, site, constructed, systems, have, the, valve, vault, components, installed, in, a, separate, structure, having, two, structural, components, can, lead, to, potentially, serious, site, problems, such, as, uneven, settling, between, components, which, results, in, stress, on, and, failure, of, the, pipes, and, connections, between, components, the, development, of, a, packaged, pump, station, system, combined, all, components, into, a, single, housing, which, not, only, eliminates, uneven, settling, issues, but, pre, plumbing, and, outfitting, each, unit, prior, to, installation, can, reduce, the, cost, and, time, involved, with, civil, work, and, site, labor, water, pumping, stations, are, differentiated, from, wastewater, pumping, stations, in, that, they, do, not, have, to, be, sized, to, account, for, high, peak, flow, rates, they, have, five, general, categories, water, pumping, stations, are, constructed, in, areas, in, which, the, demand, or, projected, demand, is, reasonably, defined, and, is, dependent, on, a, combination, of, customer, needs, and, fire, flow, requirements, average, annual, per, capita, water, consumption, peak, hour, and, maximum, daily, can, vary, greatly, due, to, factors, such, as, climate, income, levels, population, and, the, proportions, of, residential, commercial, and, industrial, users, pumping, stations, in, sewage, collection, systems, are, normally, designed, to, handle, raw, sewage, that, is, fed, from, underground, gravity, pipelines, pipes, that, are, sloped, so, that, a, liquid, can, flow, in, one, direction, under, gravity, sewage, is, fed, into, and, stored, in, a, pit, commonly, known, as, a, wet, well, the, well, is, equipped, with, electrical, instrumentation, to, detect, the, level, of, sewage, present, when, the, sewage, level, rises, to, a, predetermined, point, a, pump, will, be, started, to, lift, the, sewage, upward, through, a, pressurized, pipe, system, called, a, sewer, force, main, if, the, sewage, is, transported, some, significant, distance, the, pumping, station, may, be, called, a, lift, station, if, the, pump, merely, discharges, into, a, nearby, gravity, manhole, from, here, the, cycle, starts, all, over, again, until, the, sewage, reaches, its, point, of, destination, usually, a, treatment, plant, by, this, method, pumping, stations, are, used, to, move, waste, to, higher, elevations, in, the, case, of, high, sewage, flows, into, the, well, for, example, during, peak, flow, periods, and, wet, weather, additional, pumps, will, be, used, if, this, is, insufficient, or, in, the, case, of, failure, of, the, pumping, station, a, backup, in, the, sewer, system, can, occur, leading, to, a, sanitary, sewer, overflow, the, discharge, of, raw, sewage, into, the, environment, sewage, pumping, stations, are, typically, designed, so, that, one, pump, or, one, set, of, pumps, will, handle, normal, peak, flow, conditions, redundancy, is, built, into, the, system, so, that, in, the, event, that, any, one, pump, is, out, of, service, the, remaining, pump, or, pumps, will, handle, the, designed, flow, the, storage, volume, of, the, wet, well, between, the, pump, on, and, pump, off, settings, is, designed, to, minimize, pump, starts, and, stops, but, is, not, so, long, a, retention, time, as, to, allow, the, sewage, in, the, wet, well, to, go, septic, sewage, pumps, are, almost, always, end, suction, centrifugal, pumps, with, open, impellers, and, are, specially, designed, with, a, large, open, passage, so, as, to, avoid, clogging, with, debris, or, winding, stringy, debris, onto, the, impeller, a, four, pole, or, six, pole, ac, induction, motor, normally, drives, the, pump, rather, than, provide, large, open, passages, some, pumps, typically, smaller, sewage, pumps, also, macerate, any, solids, within, the, sewage, breaking, them, down, into, smaller, parts, which, can, more, easily, pass, through, the, impeller, the, interior, of, a, sewage, pump, station, is, a, very, dangerous, place, poisonous, gases, such, as, methane, and, hydrogen, sulfide, can, accumulate, in, the, wet, well, an, ill, equipped, person, entering, the, well, would, be, overcome, by, fumes, very, quickly, any, entry, into, the, wet, well, requires, the, correct, confined, space, entry, method, for, a, hazardous, environment, to, minimize, the, need, for, entry, the, facility, is, normally, designed, to, allow, pumps, and, other, equipment, to, be, removed, from, outside, the, wet, well, traditional, sewage, pumping, stations, incorporate, both, a, wet, well, and, a, dry, well, often, these, are, the, same, structure, separated, by, an, internal, divide, in, this, configuration, pumps, are, installed, below, ground, level, on, the, base, of, the, dry, well, so, that, their, inlets, are, below, water, level, on, pump, start, priming, the, pump, and, also, maximising, the, available, npsh, although, nominally, isolated, from, the, sewage, in, the, wet, well, dry, wells, are, underground, confined, spaces, and, require, appropriate, precautions, for, entry, further, any, failure, or, leakage, of, the, pumps, or, pipework, can, discharge, sewage, directly, into, the, dry, well, with, complete, flooding, not, an, uncommon, occurrence, as, a, result, the, electric, motors, are, normally, mounted, above, the, overflow, top, water, level, of, the, wet, well, usually, above, ground, level, and, drive, the, sewage, pumps, through, an, extended, vertical, shaft, to, protect, the, above, ground, motors, from, weather, small, pump, houses, are, normally, built, which, also, incorporate, the, electrical, switchgear, and, control, electronics, these, are, the, visible, parts, of, a, traditional, sewage, pumping, station, although, they, are, typically, smaller, than, the, underground, wet, and, dry, wells, more, modern, pumping, stations, do, not, require, a, dry, well, or, pump, house, and, usually, consist, only, of, a, wet, well, in, this, configuration, submersible, sewage, pumps, with, closely, coupled, electric, motor, are, mounted, within, the, wet, well, itself, submerged, within, the, sewage, submersible, pumps, are, mounted, on, two, vertical, guide, rails, and, seal, onto, a, permanently, fixed, duckfoot, which, forms, both, a, mount, and, also, a, vertical, bend, for, the, discharge, pipe, for, maintenance, or, replacement, submersible, pumps, are, raised, by, a, chain, off, of, the, duckfoot, and, up, the, two, guide, rails, to, the, maintenance, normally, ground, level, reinstalling, the, pumps, simply, reverses, this, process, with, the, pump, being, remounted, on, the, guide, rails, and, lowered, onto, the, duckfoot, where, the, weight, of, the, pump, reseals, it, as, the, motors, are, sealed, and, weather, is, not, a, concern, no, above, ground, structures, are, required, excepting, a, small, kiosk, to, contain, the, electrical, switchgear, and, control, systems, due, to, the, much, reduced, health, and, safety, concerns, and, smaller, footprint, and, visibility, submersible, pump, sewage, pumping, stations, have, almost, completely, superseded, traditional, sewage, pumping, stations, further, a, refit, of, a, traditional, pumping, station, usually, involves, converting, it, into, a, modern, pumping, station, by, installing, submersibles, in, the, wet, well, demolishing, the, pump, house, and, retiring, the, dry, well, by, either, stripping, it, or, knocking, down, the, internal, partition, and, merging, it, with, the, wet, well, pump, manufacturers, have, always, designed, and, manufactured, electronic, devices, to, control, and, supervise, pumping, stations, today, it, is, also, very, common, to, use, a, programmable, logic, controller, plc, or, remote, terminal, unit, rtu, for, such, work, but, the, experience, needed, to, solve, certain, particular, problems, makes, an, easy, choice, to, look, for, a, specific, pump, controller, rtus, are, very, helpful, in, remote, monitoring, of, each, pumping, station, from, a, centralized, control, room, with, scada, supervisory, control, data, acquisition, systems, this, setup, can, be, helpful, in, monitoring, pump, faults, levels, and, other, alarms, and, parameters, making, it, more, efficient, a, pumped, storage, scheme, is, a, type, of, power, station, for, storing, and, producing, electricity, to, supply, high, peak, demands, by, moving, water, between, reservoirs, at, different, elevations, typically, water, is, channeled, from, a, high, level, reservoir, to, a, low, level, reservoir, through, turbine, generators, that, generate, electricity, this, is, done, when, the, station, is, required, to, generate, power, during, low, demand, periods, such, as, overnight, the, generators, are, reversed, to, become, pumps, that, move, the, water, back, up, to, the, top, reservoir, there, are, countless, thousands, of, pumping, stations, throughout, the, world, the, following, is, a, list, of, those, described, in, this, encyclopedia, in, the, uk, during, the, victorian, era, there, was, a, fashion, for, public, buildings, to, feature, highly, ornate, architecture, consequently, a, considerable, number, of, former, pumping, stations, have, been, listed, and, preserved, the, majority, were, originally, steam, powered, and, where, the, steam, engines, are, still, in, situ, many, of, the, sites, have, since, re, opened, as, museum, attractions, used, to, pump, water, from, a, well, into, a, reservoir, used, to, pump, drinking, water, from, a, reservoir, into, a, water, supply, system
