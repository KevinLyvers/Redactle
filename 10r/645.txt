basket, weaving, techniques, while, basket, weaving, is, one, of, the, widest, spread, crafts, in, the, history, of, any, human, civilization, it, is, hard, to, say, just, how, old, the, craft, is, because, natural, materials, like, wood, grass, and, animal, remains, decay, naturally, and, constantly, so, without, proper, preservation, much, of, the, history, of, basket, making, has, been, lost, and, is, simply, speculated, upon, the, earliest, reliable, evidence, for, basket, weaving, technology, in, the, middle, east, comes, from, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, phases, of, tell, sabi, abyad, ii, and, atalh, y, k, although, no, actual, basketry, remains, were, recovered, impressions, on, floor, surfaces, and, on, fragments, of, bitumen, suggest, that, basketry, objects, were, used, for, storage, and, architectural, purposes, the, extremely, well, preserved, early, neolithic, ritual, cave, site, of, nahal, hemar, yielded, thousands, of, intact, perishable, artefacts, including, basketry, containers, fabrics, and, various, types, of, cordage, additional, neolithic, basketry, impressions, have, been, uncovered, at, tell, es, sultan, jericho, netiv, hagdud, beidha, shir, tell, sabi, abyad, iii, domuztepe, umm, dabaghiyah, tell, maghzaliyah, tepe, sarab, jarmo, and, ali, kosh, the, oldest, known, baskets, were, discovered, in, faiyum, in, upper, egypt, and, have, been, carbon, dated, to, between, 10, 000, and, 12, 000, years, old, earlier, than, any, established, dates, for, archaeological, evidence, of, pottery, vessels, which, were, too, heavy, and, fragile, to, suit, far, ranging, hunter, gatherers, the, oldest, and, largest, complete, basket, discovered, in, the, negev, in, the, middle, east, dates, to, 10, 500, years, old, however, baskets, seldom, survive, as, they, are, made, from, perishable, materials, the, most, common, evidence, of, a, knowledge, of, basketry, is, an, imprint, of, the, weave, on, fragments, of, clay, pots, formed, by, packing, clay, on, the, walls, of, the, basket, and, firing, during, the, industrial, revolution, baskets, were, used, in, factories, and, for, packing, and, deliveries, wicker, furniture, became,

into, four, types, weaving, with, rattan, core, also, known, as, reed, is, one, of, the, more, popular, techniques, being, practiced, because, it, is, easily, available, it, is, pliable, and, when, woven, correctly, it, is, very, sturdy, also, while, traditional, materials, like, oak, hickory, and, willow, might, be, hard, to, come, by, reed, is, plentiful, and, can, be, cut, into, any, size, or, shape, that, might, be, needed, for, a, pattern, this, includes, flat, reed, which, is, used, for, most, square, baskets, oval, reed, which, is, used, for, many, round, baskets, and, round, reed, which, is, used, to, twine, another, advantage, is, that, reed, can, also, be, dyed, easily, to, look, like, oak, or, hickory, many, types, of, plants, can, be, used, to, create, baskets, dog, rose, honeysuckle, blackberry, briars, once, the, thorns, have, been, scraped, off, and, many, other, creepers, willow, was, used, for, its, flexibility, and, the, ease, with, which, it, could, be, grown, and, harvested, willow, baskets, were, commonly, referred, to, as, wickerwork, in, england, water, hyacinth, is, used, as, a, base, material, in, some, areas, where, the, plant, has, become, a,

purposes, the, runners, are, preferable, to, the, vine, stems, because, they, tend, to, be, straighter, pliable, materials, like, kudzu, vine, to, more, rigid, woody, vines, like, bittersweet, grapevine, honeysuckle, wisteria, and, smokevine, are, good, basket, weaving, materials, although, many, vines, are, not, uniform, in, shape, and, size, they, can, be, manipulated, and, prepared, in, a, way, that, makes, them, easily, used, in, traditional, and, contemporary, basketry, most, vines, can, be, split, and, dried, to, store, until, use, once, vines, are, ready, to, be, used, they, can, be, soaked, or, boiled, to, increase, pliability, the, type, of, baskets, that, reed, is, used, for, are, most, often, referred, to, as, wicker, baskets, though, another, popular, type, of, weaving, known, as, twining, is, also, a, technique, used, in, most, wicker, baskets, the, parts, of, a, basket, are, the, base, the, side, walls, and, the, rim, a, basket, may, also, have, a, lid, handle, or,
