high, speed, rail, hsr, is, a, type, of, rail, transport, network, utilizing, trains, that, run, significantly, faster, than, those, of, traditional, rail, using, an, integrated, system, of, specialized, rolling, stock, and, dedicated, tracks, while, there, is, no, single, standard, that, applies, worldwide, lines, built, to, handle, speeds, above, 250, km, h, 155, mph, or, upgraded, lines, in, excess, of, 200, km, h, 125, mph, are, widely, considered, to, be, high, speed, the, first, high, speed, rail, system, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, began, operations, in, honshu, japan, in, 1964, due, to, the, streamlined, spitzer, shaped, nose, cone, of, the, locomotive, the, system, also, became, known, by, its, english, nickname, bullet, train, japan, s, example, was, followed, by, several, european, countries, initially, in, italy, with, the, direttissima, line, followed, shortly, thereafter, by, france, germany, and, spain, today, much, of, europe, has, an, extensive, network, with, numerous, international, connections, more, recent, construction, since, the, 21st, century, has, led, to, china, taking, a, leading, role, in, high, speed, rail, as, of, 2023, its, network, accounted, for, over, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, total, in, addition, to, these, many, other, countries, have, developed, high, speed, rail, infrastructure, to, connect, major, cities, including, austria, belgium, denmark, finland, greece, indonesia, japan, morocco, the, netherlands, norway, poland, portugal, russia, saudi, arabia, serbia, south, korea, sweden, switzerland, taiwan, turkey, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, uzbekistan, only, in, continental, europe, and, asia, does, high, speed, rail, cross, international, borders, high, speed, trains, mostly, operate, on, standard, gauge, tracks, of, continuously, welded, rail, on, grade, separated, rights, of, way, with, large, radii, however, certain, regions, with, wider, legacy, railways, including, russia, and, uzbekistan, have, sought, to, develop, a, high, speed, railway, network, in, russian, gauge, spain, and, portugal, managed, to, develop, high, speed, rail, in, iberian, gauge, there, are, no, narrow, gauge, high, speed, trains, countries, whose, legacy, network, is, entirely, or, mostly, of, a, different, gauge, than, 1435mm, including, japan, and, spain, have, however, often, opted, to, build, their, high, speed, lines, to, standard, gauge, instead, of, the, legacy, railway, gauge, high, speed, rail, is, the, fastest, and, most, efficient, ground, based, method, of, commercial, transportation, however, due, to, requirements, for, large, track, curves, gentle, gradients, and, grade, separated, track, the, construction, of, high, speed, rail, is, more, costly, than, conventional, rail, and, therefore, does, not, always, present, an, economical, advantage, over, conventional, speed, rail, multiple, definitions, for, high, speed, rail, are, in, use, worldwide, the, european, union, directive, 96, 48, ec, annex, 1, see, also, trans, european, high, speed, rail, network, defines, high, speed, rail, in, terms, of, the, international, union, of, railways, uic, identifies, three, categories, of, high, speed, rail, a, third, definition, of, high, speed, and, very, high, speed, rail, requires, simultaneous, fulfilment, of, the, following, two, conditions, the, uic, prefers, to, use, definitions, plural, because, they, consider, that, there, is, no, single, standard, definition, of, high, speed, rail, nor, even, standard, usage, of, the, terms, high, speed, or, very, high, speed, they, make, use, of, the, european, ec, directive, 96, 48, stating, that, high, speed, is, a, combination, of, all, the, elements, which, constitute, the, system, infrastructure, rolling, stock, and, operating, conditions, the, international, union, of, railways, states, that, high, speed, rail, is, a, set, of, unique, features, not, merely, a, train, travelling, above, a, particular, speed, many, conventionally, hauled, trains, are, able, to, reach, 200, km, h, 124, mph, in, commercial, service, but, are, not, considered, to, be, high, speed, trains, these, include, the, french, sncf, intercit, s, and, german, db, ic, the, criterion, of, 200, km, h, 124, mph, is, selected, for, several, reasons, above, this, speed, the, impacts, of, geometric, defects, are, intensified, track, adhesion, is, decreased, aerodynamic, resistance, is, greatly, increased, pressure, fluctuations, within, tunnels, cause, passenger, discomfort, and, it, becomes, difficult, for, drivers, to, identify, trackside, signalling, standard, signaling, equipment, is, often, limited, to, speeds, below, 200, km, h, 124, mph, with, the, traditional, limits, of, 127, km, h, 79, mph, in, the, us, 160, km, h, 99, mph, in, germany, and, 125, mph, 201, km, h, in, britain, above, those, speeds, positive, train, control, or, the, european, train, control, system, becomes, necessary, or, legally, mandatory, national, domestic, standards, may, vary, from, the, international, ones, railways, were, the, first, form, of, rapid, land, transportation, and, had, an, effective, monopoly, on, long, distance, passenger, traffic, until, the, development, of, the, motor, car, and, airliners, in, the, early, mid, 20th, century, speed, had, always, been, an, important, factor, for, railroads, and, they, constantly, tried, to, achieve, higher, speeds, and, decrease, journey, times, rail, transportation, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, not, much, slower, than, non, high, speed, trains, today, and, many, railroads, regularly, operated, relatively, fast, express, trains, which, averaged, speeds, of, around, 100, km, h, 62, mph, high, speed, rail, development, began, in, germany, in, 1899, when, the, prussian, state, railway, joined, with, ten, electrical, and, engineering, firms, and, electrified, 72, km, 45, mi, of, military, owned, railway, between, marienfelde, and, zossen, the, line, used, three, phase, current, at, 10, kilovolts, and, 45, hz, the, van, der, zypen, charlier, company, of, deutz, cologne, built, two, railcars, one, fitted, with, electrical, equipment, from, siemens, halske, the, second, with, equipment, from, allgemeine, elektrizit, ts, gesellschaft, aeg, that, were, tested, on, the, marienfelde, zossen, line, during, 1902, and, 1903, see, experimental, three, phase, railcar, on, 23, october, 1903, the, s, h, equipped, railcar, achieved, a, speed, of, 206, 7, km, h, 128, 4, mph, and, on, 27, october, the, aeg, equipped, railcar, achieved, 210, 2, km, h, 130, 6, mph, these, trains, demonstrated, the, feasibility, of, electric, high, speed, rail, however, regularly, scheduled, electric, high, speed, rail, travel, was, still, more, than, 30, years, away, after, the, breakthrough, of, electric, railroads, it, was, clearly, the, infrastructure, especially, the, cost, of, it, which, hampered, the, introduction, of, high, speed, rail, several, disasters, happened, derailments, head, on, collisions, on, single, track, lines, collisions, with, road, traffic, at, grade, crossings, etc, the, physical, laws, were, well, known, i, e, if, the, speed, was, doubled, the, curve, radius, should, be, quadrupled, the, same, was, true, for, the, acceleration, and, braking, distances, in, 1891, the, engineer, k, roly, zipernowsky, proposed, a, high, speed, line, vienna, budapest, bound, for, electric, railcars, at, 250, km, h, 160, mph, in, 1893, wellington, adams, proposed, an, air, line, from, chicago, to, st, louis, of, 252, miles, 406, km, at, a, speed, of, only, 160, km, h, 99, mph, alexander, c, miller, had, greater, ambitions, in, 1906, he, launched, the, chicago, new, york, electric, air, line, railroad, project, to, reduce, the, running, time, between, the, two, big, cities, to, ten, hours, by, using, electric, 160, km, h, 99, mph, locomotives, after, seven, years, of, effort, however, less, than, 50, km, 31, mi, of, arrow, straight, track, was, finished, a, part, of, the, line, is, still, used, as, one, of, the, last, interurbans, in, the, us, in, the, us, some, of, the, interurbans, i, e, trams, or, streetcars, which, run, from, city, to, city, of, the, early, 20th, century, were, very, high, speed, for, their, time, also, europe, had, and, still, does, have, some, interurbans, several, high, speed, rail, technologies, have, their, origin, in, the, interurban, field, in, 1903, 30, years, before, the, conventional, railways, started, to, streamline, their, trains, the, officials, of, the, louisiana, purchase, exposition, organised, the, electric, railway, test, commission, to, conduct, a, series, of, tests, to, develop, a, carbody, design, that, would, reduce, wind, resistance, at, high, speeds, a, long, series, of, tests, was, carried, in, 1905, st, louis, car, company, built, a, railcar, for, the, traction, magnate, henry, e, huntington, capable, of, speeds, approaching, 160, km, h, 100, mph, once, it, ran, 32, km, 20, mi, between, los, angeles, and, long, beach, in, 15, minutes, an, average, speed, of, 130, km, h, 80, mph, however, it, was, too, heavy, for, much, of, the, tracks, so, cincinnati, car, company, j, g, brill, and, others, pioneered, lightweight, constructions, use, of, aluminium, alloys, and, low, level, bogies, which, could, operate, smoothly, at, extremely, high, speeds, on, rough, interurban, tracks, westinghouse, and, general, electric, designed, motors, compact, enough, to, be, mounted, on, the, bogies, from, 1930, on, the, red, devils, from, cincinnati, car, company, and, a, some, other, interurban, rail, cars, reached, about, 145, km, h, 90, mph, in, commercial, traffic, the, red, devils, weighed, only, 22, tons, though, they, could, seat, 44, passengers, extensive, wind, tunnel, research, the, first, in, the, railway, industry, was, done, before, j, g, brill, in, 1931, built, the, bullet, cars, for, philadelphia, and, western, railroad, p, w, they, were, capable, of, running, at, 148, km, h, 92, mph, some, of, them, were, almost, 60, years, in, service, p, w, s, norristown, high, speed, line, is, still, in, use, almost, 110, years, after, p, w, in, 1907, opened, their, double, track, upper, darby, strafford, line, without, a, single, grade, crossing, with, roads, or, other, railways, the, entire, line, was, governed, by, an, absolute, block, signal, system, on, 15, may, 1933, the, deutsche, reichsbahn, gesellschaft, company, introduced, the, diesel, powered, fliegender, hamburger, in, regular, service, between, hamburg, and, berlin, 286, km, or, 178, mi, thereby, achieving, a, new, top, speed, for, a, regular, service, with, a, top, speed, of, 160, km, h, 99, mph, this, train, was, a, streamlined, multi, powered, unit, albeit, diesel, and, used, jakobs, bogies, following, the, success, of, the, hamburg, line, the, steam, powered, henschel, wegmann, train, was, developed, and, introduced, in, june, 1936, for, service, from, berlin, to, dresden, with, a, regular, top, speed, of, 160, km, h, 99, mph, incidentally, no, train, service, since, the, cancelation, of, this, express, train, in, 1939, has, traveled, between, the, two, cities, in, a, faster, time, as, of, 2018, in, august, 2019, the, travel, time, between, dresden, neustadt, and, berlin, s, dkreuz, was, 102, minutes, see, berlin, dresden, railway, further, development, allowed, the, usage, of, these, fliegenden, z, ge, flying, trains, on, a, rail, network, across, germany, the, diesel, schnelltriebwagen, netz, diesel, high, speed, vehicle, network, had, been, in, the, planning, since, 1934, but, it, never, reached, its, envisaged, size, all, high, speed, service, stopped, in, august, 1939, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, on, 26, may, 1934, one, year, after, fliegender, hamburger, introduction, the, burlington, railroad, set, an, average, speed, record, on, long, distance, with, their, new, streamlined, train, the, zephyr, at, 124, km, h, 77, mph, with, peaks, at, 185, km, h, 115, mph, the, zephyr, was, made, of, stainless, steel, and, like, the, fliegender, hamburger, was, diesel, powered, articulated, with, jacobs, bogies, and, could, reach, 160, km, h, 99, mph, as, commercial, speed, the, new, service, was, inaugurated, 11, november, 1934, traveling, between, kansas, city, and, lincoln, but, at, a, lower, speed, than, the, record, on, average, speed, 74, km, h, 46, mph, in, 1935, the, milwaukee, road, introduced, the, morning, hiawatha, service, hauled, at, 160, km, h, 99, mph, by, steam, locomotives, in, 1939, the, largest, railroad, of, the, world, the, pennsylvania, railroad, introduced, a, duplex, steam, engine, class, s1, which, was, designed, to, be, capable, of, hauling, 1200, tons, passenger, trains, at, 161, km, h, 100, mph, the, s1, engine, was, assigned, to, power, the, popular, all, coach, overnight, premier, train, the, trail, blazer, between, new, york, and, chicago, since, the, late, 1940s, and, it, consistently, reached, 161, km, h, 100, mph, in, its, service, life, these, were, the, last, high, speed, trains, to, use, steam, power, in, 1936, the, twin, cities, zephyr, entered, service, from, chicago, to, minneapolis, with, an, average, speed, of, 101, km, h, 63, mph, many, of, these, streamliners, posted, travel, times, comparable, to, or, even, better, than, their, modern, amtrak, successors, which, are, limited, to, 127, km, h, 79, mph, top, speed, on, most, of, the, network, the, german, high, speed, service, was, followed, in, italy, in, 1938, with, an, electric, multiple, unit, etr, 200, designed, for, 200, km, h, 120, mph, between, bologna, and, naples, it, too, reached, 160, km, h, 99, mph, in, commercial, service, and, achieved, a, world, mean, speed, record, of, 203, km, h, 126, mph, between, florence, and, milan, in, 1938, in, great, britain, in, the, same, year, the, streamlined, steam, locomotive, mallard, achieved, the, official, world, speed, record, for, steam, locomotives, at, 202, 58, km, h, 125, 88, mph, the, external, combustion, engines, and, boilers, on, steam, locomotives, were, large, heavy, and, time, and, labor, intensive, to, maintain, and, the, days, of, steam, for, high, speed, were, numbered, in, 1945, a, spanish, engineer, alejandro, goicoechea, developed, a, streamlined, articulated, train, that, was, able, to, run, on, existing, tracks, at, higher, speeds, than, contemporary, passenger, trains, this, was, achieved, by, providing, the, locomotive, and, cars, with, a, unique, axle, system, that, used, one, axle, set, per, car, end, connected, by, a, y, bar, coupler, amongst, other, advantages, the, centre, of, mass, was, only, half, as, high, as, usual, this, system, became, famous, under, the, name, of, talgo, tren, articulado, ligero, goicoechea, oriol, and, for, half, a, century, was, the, main, spanish, provider, of, high, speed, trains, in, the, early, 1950s, the, french, national, railway, started, to, receive, their, new, powerful, cc, 7100, electric, locomotives, and, began, to, study, and, evaluate, running, at, higher, speeds, in, 1954, the, cc, 7121, hauling, a, full, train, achieved, a, record, 243, km, h, 151, mph, during, a, test, on, standard, track, the, next, year, two, specially, tuned, electric, locomotives, the, cc, 7107, and, the, prototype, bb, 9004, broke, previous, speed, records, reaching, respectively, 320, km, h, 200, mph, and, 331, km, h, 206, mph, again, on, standard, track, for, the, first, time, 300, km, h, 190, mph, was, surpassed, allowing, the, idea, of, higher, speed, services, to, be, developed, and, further, engineering, studies, commenced, especially, during, the, 1955, records, a, dangerous, hunting, oscillation, the, swaying, of, the, bogies, which, leads, to, dynamic, instability, and, potential, derailment, was, discovered, this, problem, was, solved, by, yaw, dampers, which, enabled, safe, running, at, high, speeds, today, research, was, also, made, about, current, harnessing, at, high, speed, by, the, pantographs, which, was, solved, 20, years, later, by, the, z, bulon, tgv, s, prototype, with, some, 45, million, people, living, in, the, densely, populated, tokyo, osaka, corridor, congestion, on, road, and, rail, became, a, serious, problem, after, world, war, ii, and, the, japanese, government, began, thinking, about, ways, to, transport, people, in, and, between, cities, because, japan, was, resource, limited, and, did, not, want, to, import, petroleum, for, security, reasons, energy, efficient, high, speed, rail, was, an, attractive, potential, solution, japanese, national, railways, jnr, engineers, began, to, study, the, development, of, a, high, speed, regular, mass, transit, service, in, 1955, they, were, present, at, the, lille, s, electrotechnology, congress, in, france, and, during, a, 6, month, visit, the, head, engineer, of, jnr, accompanied, the, deputy, director, marcel, tessier, at, the, dete, sncf, electric, traction, study, department, jnr, engineers, returned, to, japan, with, a, number, of, ideas, and, technologies, they, would, use, on, their, future, trains, including, alternating, current, for, rail, traction, and, international, standard, gauge, in, 1957, the, engineers, at, the, private, odakyu, electric, railway, in, greater, tokyo, area, launched, the, odakyu, 3000, series, se, emu, this, emu, set, a, world, record, for, narrow, gauge, trains, at, 145, km, h, 90, mph, giving, the, odakyu, engineers, confidence, they, could, safely, and, reliably, build, even, faster, trains, at, standard, gauge, conventional, japanese, railways, up, until, that, point, had, largely, been, built, in, the, 1, 067, mm, 3, ft, 6, in, cape, gauge, however, widening, the, tracks, to, standard, gauge, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, would, make, very, high, speed, rail, much, simpler, due, to, improved, stability, of, the, wider, rail, gauge, and, thus, standard, gauge, was, adopted, for, high, speed, service, with, the, sole, exceptions, of, russia, finland, and, uzbekistan, all, high, speed, rail, lines, in, the, world, are, still, standard, gauge, even, in, countries, where, the, preferred, gauge, for, legacy, lines, is, different, the, new, service, named, shinkansen, meaning, new, main, line, would, provide, a, new, alignment, 25, wider, standard, gauge, continuously, welded, rails, between, tokyo, and, osaka, using, new, rolling, stock, designed, for, 250, km, h, 160, mph, however, the, world, bank, whilst, supporting, the, project, considered, the, design, of, the, equipment, as, unproven, for, that, speed, and, set, the, maximum, speed, to, 210, km, h, 130, mph, after, initial, feasibility, tests, the, plan, was, fast, tracked, and, construction, of, the, first, section, of, the, line, started, on, 20, april, 1959, in, 1963, on, the, new, track, test, runs, hit, a, top, speed, of, 256, km, h, 159, mph, five, years, after, the, beginning, of, the, construction, work, in, october, 1964, just, in, time, for, the, olympic, games, the, first, modern, high, speed, rail, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, was, opened, between, the, two, cities, a, 510, km, 320, mi, stretch, between, tokyo, and, saka, as, a, result, of, its, speeds, the, shinkansen, earned, international, publicity, and, praise, and, it, was, dubbed, the, bullet, train, the, first, shinkansen, trains, the, 0, series, shinkansen, built, by, kawasaki, heavy, industries, in, english, often, called, bullet, trains, after, the, original, japanese, name, dangan, ressha, outclassed, the, earlier, fast, trains, in, commercial, service, they, traversed, the, 515, km, 320, mi, distance, in, 3, hours, 10, minutes, reaching, a, top, speed, of, 210, km, h, 130, mph, and, sustaining, an, average, speed, of, 162, 8, km, h, 101, 2, mph, with, stops, at, nagoya, and, kyoto, speed, was, not, only, a, part, of, the, shinkansen, revolution, the, shinkansen, offered, high, speed, rail, travel, to, the, masses, the, first, bullet, trains, had, 12, cars, and, later, versions, had, up, to, 16, and, double, deck, trains, further, increased, the, capacity, after, three, years, more, than, 100, million, passengers, had, used, the, trains, and, the, milestone, of, the, first, one, billion, passengers, was, reached, in, 1976, in, 1972, the, line, was, extended, a, further, 161, km, 100, mi, and, further, construction, has, resulted, in, the, network, expanding, to, 3, 058, km, 1, 900, mi, as, of, march, 2020, with, a, further, 399, km, 248, mi, of, extensions, currently, under, construction, and, due, to, open, in, stages, between, march, 2023, and, 2031, the, cumulative, patronage, on, the, entire, system, since, 1964, is, over, 10, billion, the, equivalent, of, approximately, 140, of, the, world, s, population, without, a, single, train, passenger, fatality, suicides, passengers, falling, off, the, platforms, and, industrial, accidents, have, resulted, in, fatalities, since, their, introduction, japan, s, shinkansen, systems, have, been, undergoing, constant, improvement, not, only, increasing, line, speeds, over, a, dozen, train, models, have, been, produced, addressing, diverse, issues, such, as, tunnel, boom, noise, vibration, aerodynamic, drag, lines, with, lower, patronage, mini, shinkansen, earthquake, and, typhoon, safety, braking, distance, problems, due, to, snow, and, energy, consumption, newer, trains, are, twice, as, energy, efficient, as, the, initial, ones, despite, greater, speeds, after, decades, of, research, and, successful, testing, on, a, 43, km, 27, mi, test, track, jr, central, is, now, constructing, a, maglev, shinkansen, line, which, is, known, as, the, ch, shinkansen, these, maglev, trains, still, have, the, traditional, underlying, tracks, and, the, cars, have, wheels, this, serves, a, practical, purpose, at, stations, and, a, safety, purpose, out, on, the, lines, in, the, event, of, a, power, failure, however, in, normal, operation, the, wheels, are, raised, up, into, the, car, as, the, train, reaches, certain, speeds, where, the, magnetic, levitation, effect, takes, over, it, will, link, tokyo, and, osaka, by, 2037, with, the, section, from, tokyo, to, nagoya, expected, to, be, operational, by, 2027, average, speed, is, anticipated, at, 505, km, h, 314, mph, the, first, generation, train, can, be, ridden, by, tourists, visiting, the, test, track, china, is, developing, two, separate, high, speed, maglev, systems, in, europe, high, speed, rail, began, during, the, international, transport, fair, in, munich, in, june, 1965, when, dr, pfering, the, director, of, deutsche, bundesbahn, german, federal, railways, performed, 347, demonstrations, at, 200, km, h, 120, mph, between, munich, and, augsburg, by, db, class, 103, hauled, trains, the, same, year, the, a, rotrain, a, french, hovercraft, monorail, train, prototype, reached, 200, km, h, 120, mph, within, days, of, operation, after, the, successful, introduction, of, the, japanese, shinkansen, in, 1964, at, 210, km, h, 130, mph, the, german, demonstrations, up, to, 200, km, h, 120, mph, in, 1965, and, the, proof, of, concept, jet, powered, a, rotrain, sncf, ran, its, fastest, trains, at, 160, km, h, 99, mph, in, 1966, french, infrastructure, minister, edgard, pisani, consulted, engineers, and, gave, the, french, national, railways, twelve, months, to, raise, speeds, to, 200, km, h, 120, mph, the, classic, line, paris, toulouse, was, chosen, and, fitted, to, support, 200, km, h, 120, mph, rather, than, 140, km, h, 87, mph, some, improvements, were, set, notably, the, signals, system, development, of, on, board, in, cab, signalling, system, and, curve, revision, the, next, year, in, may, 1967, a, regular, service, at, 200, km, h, 120, mph, was, inaugurated, by, the, tee, le, capitole, between, paris, and, toulouse, with, specially, adapted, sncf, class, bb, 9200, locomotives, hauling, classic, uic, cars, and, a, full, red, livery, it, averaged, 119, km, h, 74, mph, over, the, 713, km, 443, mi, at, the, same, time, the, a, rotrain, prototype, 02, reached, 345, km, h, 214, mph, on, a, half, scale, experimental, track, in, 1969, it, achieved, 422, km, h, 262, mph, on, the, same, track, on, 5, march, 1974, the, full, scale, commercial, prototype, a, rotrain, i80hv, jet, powered, reached, 430, km, h, 270, mph, in, the, united, states, following, the, creation, of, japan, s, first, high, speed, shinkansen, president, lyndon, b, johnson, as, part, of, his, great, society, infrastructure, building, initiatives, asked, the, congress, to, devise, a, way, to, increase, speeds, on, the, railroads, congress, delivered, the, high, speed, ground, transportation, act, of, 1965, which, passed, with, overwhelming, bipartisan, support, and, helped, to, create, regular, metroliner, service, between, new, york, city, philadelphia, and, washington, d, c, the, new, service, was, inaugurated, in, 1969, with, top, speeds, of, 200, km, h, 120, mph, and, averaging, 145, km, h, 90, mph, along, the, route, with, the, travel, time, as, little, as, 2, hours, 30, minutes, in, a, 1967, competition, with, a, ge, powered, metroliner, on, penn, central, s, mainline, the, united, aircraft, corporation, turbotrain, set, a, record, of, 275, km, h, 171, mph, in, 1976, british, rail, introduced, a, high, speed, service, able, to, reach, 201, km, h, 125, mph, using, the, intercity, 125, diesel, electric, trainsets, under, the, brand, name, of, high, speed, train, hst, it, was, the, fastest, diesel, powered, train, in, regular, service, and, it, improved, upon, its, 160, km, h, 100, mph, forerunners, in, speed, and, acceleration, as, of, 2019, it, is, still, in, regular, service, as, the, fastest, diesel, powered, train, the, train, was, as, a, reversible, multi, car, set, having, driving, power, cars, at, both, ends, and, a, fixed, formation, of, passenger, cars, between, them, journey, times, were, reduced, by, an, hour, for, example, on, the, east, coast, main, line, and, passenger, numbers, increased, as, of, 2019, many, of, these, trains, are, still, in, service, private, operators, have, often, preferred, to, rebuild, the, units, with, new, engines, rather, than, replace, them, prior, to, covid, 19, ridership, of, the, uk, s, high, speed, intercity, services, had, exceeded, 40, million, journeys, per, annum, the, next, year, in, 1977, germany, finally, introduced, a, new, service, at, 200, km, h, 120, mph, on, the, munich, augsburg, line, that, same, year, italy, inaugurated, the, first, european, high, speed, line, the, direttissima, between, rome, and, florence, designed, for, 250, km, h, 160, mph, but, used, by, fs, e444, hauled, train, at, 200, km, h, 120, mph, in, france, this, year, also, saw, the, abandonment, for, political, reasons, of, the, a, rotrain, project, in, favour, of, the, tgv, the, earliest, european, high, speed, railway, to, be, built, was, the, italian, florence, rome, high, speed, railway, also, called, direttissima, in, 1977, high, speed, trains, in, italy, were, developed, during, the, 1960s, e444, locomotives, were, the, first, standard, locomotives, capable, of, top, speed, of, 200, km, h, 125, mph, while, an, ale, 601, electrical, multiple, unit, emu, reached, a, speed, of, 240, km, h, 150, mph, during, a, test, other, emus, such, as, the, etr, 220, etr, 250, and, etr, 300, were, also, updated, for, speeds, up, to, 200, km, h, 125, mph, the, braking, systems, of, cars, were, updated, to, match, the, increased, travelling, speeds, on, 25, june, 1970, work, was, started, on, the, rome, florence, direttissima, the, first, high, speed, line, in, italy, and, in, europe, it, included, the, 5, 375, metre, long, 3, 340, mi, bridge, on, the, paglia, river, then, the, longest, in, europe, works, were, completed, in, the, early, 1990s, in, 1975, a, program, for, a, widespread, updating, of, the, rolling, stock, was, launched, however, as, it, was, decided, to, put, more, emphasis, on, local, traffic, this, caused, a, shifting, of, resources, from, the, ongoing, high, speed, projects, with, their, subsequent, slowing, or, in, some, cases, total, abandonment, therefore, 160, e, 656, electric, and, 35, d, 345, locomotives, for, short, medium, range, traffic, were, acquired, together, with, 80, emus, of, the, ale, 801, 940, class, 120, aln, 668, diesel, railcars, some, 1, 000, much, needed, passenger, and, 7, 000, freight, cars, were, also, ordered, in, the, 1990s, work, started, on, the, treno, alta, velocit, tav, project, which, involved, building, a, new, high, speed, network, on, the, routes, milan, bologna, florence, rome, naples, salerno, turin, milan, verona, venice, trieste, and, milan, genoa, most, of, the, planned, lines, have, already, been, opened, while, international, links, with, france, switzerland, austria, and, slovenia, are, underway, most, of, the, rome, naples, line, opened, in, december, 2005, the, turin, milan, line, partially, opened, in, february, 2006, and, the, milan, bologna, line, opened, in, december, 2008, the, remaining, sections, of, the, rome, naples, and, the, turin, milan, lines, and, the, bologna, florence, line, were, completed, in, december, 2009, all, these, lines, are, designed, for, speeds, up, to, 300, km, h, 190, mph, since, then, it, is, possible, to, travel, from, turin, to, salerno, ca, 950, km, 590, mi, in, less, than, 5, hours, more, than, 100, trains, per, day, are, operated, other, proposed, high, speed, lines, are, salerno, reggio, calabria, connected, to, sicily, with, the, future, bridge, over, the, strait, of, messina, palermo, catania, and, naples, bari, the, main, public, operator, of, high, speed, trains, alta, velocit, av, formerly, eurostar, italia, is, trenitalia, part, of, fsi, trains, are, divided, into, three, categories, frecciarossa, red, arrow, trains, operate, at, a, maximum, of, 300, km, h, 185, mph, on, dedicated, high, speed, tracks, frecciargento, silver, arrow, trains, operate, at, a, maximum, of, 250, km, h, 155, mph, on, both, high, speed, and, mainline, tracks, frecciabianca, white, arrow, trains, operate, at, a, maximum, of, 200, km, h, 125, mph, on, mainline, tracks, only, since, 2012, a, new, and, italy, s, first, private, train, operator, ntv, branded, as, italo, run, high, speed, services, in, competition, with, trenitalia, even, nowadays, italy, is, the, only, country, in, europe, with, a, private, high, speed, train, operator, construction, of, the, milan, venice, high, speed, line, has, begun, in, 2013, and, in, 2016, the, milan, treviglio, section, has, been, opened, to, passenger, traffic, the, milan, genoa, high, speed, line, terzo, valico, dei, giovi, is, also, under, construction, today, it, is, possible, to, travel, from, rome, to, milan, in, less, than, 3, hours, 2h, 55, with, the, frecciarossa, 1000, the, new, high, speed, train, to, cover, this, route, there, s, a, train, every, 30, minutes, following, the, 1955, records, two, divisions, of, the, sncf, began, to, study, high, speed, services, in, 1964, the, detmt, petrol, engine, traction, studies, department, of, sncf, investigated, the, use, of, gas, turbines, a, diesel, powered, railcar, was, modified, with, a, gas, turbine, and, was, called, tgv, turbotrain, grande, vitesse, it, reached, 230, km, h, 140, mph, in, 1967, and, served, as, a, basis, for, the, future, turbotrain, and, the, real, tgv, at, the, same, time, the, new, sncf, research, department, created, in, 1966, was, studying, various, projects, including, one, code, named, c03, railways, possibilities, on, new, infrastructure, tracks, in, 1969, the, c03, project, was, transferred, to, public, administration, while, a, contract, with, alstom, was, signed, for, the, construction, of, two, gas, turbine, high, speed, train, prototypes, named, tgv, 001, the, prototype, consisted, of, a, set, of, five, carriages, plus, a, power, car, at, each, end, both, powered, by, two, gas, turbine, engines, the, sets, used, jacobs, bogies, which, reduce, drag, and, increase, safety, in, 1970, the, detmt, s, turbotrain, began, operations, on, the, paris, cherbourg, line, and, operated, at, 160, km, h, 99, mph, despite, being, designed, for, usage, at, 200, km, h, 120, mph, it, used, gas, turbine, powered, multiple, elements, and, was, the, basis, for, future, experimentation, with, tgv, services, including, shuttle, services, and, regular, high, rate, schedules, in, 1971, the, c03, project, now, known, as, tgv, sud, est, was, validated, by, the, government, against, bertin, s, aerotrain, until, this, date, there, was, a, rivalry, between, the, french, land, settlement, commission, datar, supporting, the, a, rotrain, and, the, sncf, and, its, ministry, supporting, conventional, rail, the, c03, project, included, a, new, high, speed, line, between, paris, and, lyon, with, new, multi, engined, trains, running, at, 260, km, h, 160, mph, at, that, time, the, classic, paris, lyon, line, was, already, congested, and, a, new, line, was, required, this, busy, corridor, neither, too, short, where, high, speeds, give, limited, reductions, in, end, to, end, times, nor, too, long, where, planes, are, faster, in, city, center, to, city, center, travel, time, was, the, best, choice, for, the, new, service, the, 1973, oil, crisis, substantially, increased, oil, prices, in, the, continuity, of, the, de, gaulle, energy, self, sufficiency, and, nuclear, energy, policy, pierre, messmer, then, french, prime, minister, announced, an, ambitious, buildout, of, nuclear, power, in, france, in, 1974, a, ministry, decision, switched, the, future, tgv, from, now, costly, gas, turbine, to, full, electric, energy, in, 1974, an, electric, railcar, named, z, bulon, was, developed, for, testing, at, very, high, speeds, reaching, a, speed, of, 306, km, h, 190, mph, it, was, used, to, develop, pantographs, capable, of, withstanding, speeds, of, over, 300, km, h, 190, mph, after, intensive, tests, with, the, gas, turbine, tgv, 001, prototype, and, the, electric, z, bulon, in, 1977, the, sncf, placed, an, order, to, the, group, alstom, francorail, mte, for, 87, tgv, sud, est, trainsets, they, used, the, tgv, 001, concept, with, a, permanently, coupled, set, of, eight, cars, sharing, jacobs, bogies, and, hauled, by, two, electric, power, cars, one, at, each, end, in, 1981, the, first, section, of, the, new, paris, lyon, high, speed, line, was, inaugurated, with, a, 260, km, h, 160, mph, top, speed, then, 270, km, h, 170, mph, soon, after, being, able, to, use, both, dedicated, high, speed, and, conventional, lines, the, tgv, offered, the, ability, to, join, every, city, in, the, country, at, shorter, journey, times, after, the, introduction, of, the, tgv, on, some, routes, air, traffic, on, these, routes, decreased, and, in, some, cases, disappeared, the, tgv, set, a, publicised, speed, records, in, 1981, at, 380, km, h, 240, mph, in, 1990, at, 515, km, h, 320, mph, and, then, in, 2007, at, 574, 8, km, h, 357, 2, mph, although, these, were, test, speeds, rather, than, operation, train, speeds, following, the, etr, 450, and, direttissima, in, italy, and, french, tgv, in, 1991, germany, was, the, third, country, in, europe, to, inaugurate, a, high, speed, rail, service, with, the, launch, of, the, intercity, express, ice, on, the, new, hannover, w, rzburg, high, speed, railway, operating, at, a, top, speed, of, 280, km, h, 170, mph, the, german, ice, train, was, similar, to, the, tgv, with, dedicated, streamlined, power, cars, at, both, ends, but, a, variable, number, of, trailers, between, them, unlike, the, tgv, the, trailers, had, two, conventional, bogies, per, car, and, could, be, uncoupled, allowing, the, train, to, be, lengthened, or, shortened, this, introduction, was, the, result, of, ten, years, of, study, with, the, ice, v, prototype, originally, called, intercity, experimental, which, broke, the, world, speed, record, in, 1988, reaching, 406, km, h, 252, mph, in, 1992, just, in, time, for, the, barcelona, olympic, games, and, seville, expo, 92, the, madrid, seville, high, speed, rail, line, opened, in, spain, with, 25, kv, ac, electrification, and, standard, gauge, differing, from, all, other, spanish, lines, which, used, iberian, gauge, this, allowed, the, ave, rail, service, to, begin, operations, using, class, 100, trainsets, built, by, alstom, directly, derived, in, design, from, the, french, tgv, trains, the, service, was, very, popular, and, development, continued, on, high, speed, rail, in, spain, in, 2005, the, spanish, government, announced, an, ambitious, plan, peit, 2005, 2020, envisioning, that, by, 2020, 90, percent, of, the, population, would, live, within, 50, km, 30, mi, of, a, station, served, by, ave, spain, began, building, the, largest, hsr, network, in, europe, as, of, 2011, five, of, the, new, lines, have, opened, madrid, zaragoza, lleida, tarragona, barcelona, c, rdoba, malaga, madrid, toledo, madrid, segovia, valladolid, madrid, cuenca, valencia, and, another, 2, 219, km, 1, 380, mi, were, under, construction, opened, in, early, 2013, the, perpignan, barcelona, high, speed, rail, line, provides, a, link, with, neighbouring, france, with, trains, running, to, paris, lyon, montpellier, and, marseille, as, of, may, 2023, the, spanish, high, speed, rail, network, is, the, longest, hsr, network, in, europe, with, 3, 966, km, 2, 464, mi, and, the, second, longest, in, the, world, after, china, s, in, 2009, turkey, inaugurated, a, high, speed, service, between, ankara, and, eski, ehir, this, has, been, followed, up, by, an, ankara, konya, route, and, the, eskisehir, line, has, been, extended, to, istanbul, european, part, in, this, extension, europe, and, asia, were, connected, by, an, undersea, tunnel, marmaray, in, the, bosphorus, the, first, connection, between, two, continents, in, the, world, as, a, high, speed, train, line, was, made, in, istanbul, the, last, station, of, this, line, in, europe, is, halkal, station, an, extension, to, sivas, was, opened, in, april, 2023, in, 1992, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, amtrak, authorization, and, development, act, that, authorized, amtrak, to, start, working, on, service, improvements, on, the, segment, between, boston, and, new, york, city, of, the, northeast, corridor, the, primary, objectives, were, to, electrify, the, line, north, of, new, haven, connecticut, to, eliminate, grade, crossings, and, replace, the, then, 30, year, old, metro, liners, with, new, trains, so, that, the, distance, between, boston, and, new, york, city, could, be, covered, in, 3, hours, or, less, amtrak, started, testing, two, trains, the, swedish, x2000, and, the, german, ice, 1, in, the, same, year, along, its, fully, electrified, segment, between, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, the, officials, favored, the, x2000, as, it, had, a, tilting, mechanism, however, the, swedish, manufacturer, never, bid, on, the, contract, as, the, burdensome, united, states, railroad, regulations, required, them, to, heavily, modify, the, train, resulting, in, added, weight, among, other, things, eventually, a, custom, made, tilting, train, derived, from, tgv, manufactured, by, alstom, and, bombardier, won, the, contract, and, was, put, into, service, in, december, 2000, the, new, service, was, named, acela, express, and, linked, boston, new, york, city, philadelphia, baltimore, and, washington, d, c, the, service, did, not, meet, the, 3, hour, travel, time, objective, between, boston, and, new, york, city, the, time, was, 3, hours, and, 24, minutes, as, it, partially, ran, on, regular, lines, limiting, its, average, speed, with, a, maximum, speed, of, 240, km, h, 150, mph, being, reached, on, a, small, section, of, its, route, through, rhode, island, and, massachusetts, as, of, november, 2021, the, u, s, has, one, high, speed, rail, line, under, construction, california, high, speed, rail, in, california, and, advanced, planning, by, a, company, called, texas, central, railway, in, texas, higher, speed, rail, projects, in, the, pacific, northwest, midwest, and, southeast, as, well, as, upgrades, on, the, high, speed, northeast, corridor, the, private, higher, speed, rail, venture, brightline, in, florida, started, operations, along, part, of, its, route, in, early, 2018, the, top, speed, is, 201, km, h, 125, mph, but, most, of, the, line, still, runs, at, 127, km, h, 79, mph, for, four, decades, from, its, opening, in, 1964, the, japanese, shinkansen, was, the, only, high, speed, rail, service, outside, of, europe, in, the, 2000s, a, number, of, new, high, speed, rail, services, started, operating, in, east, asia, high, speed, rail, was, introduced, to, china, in, 2003, with, the, qinhuangdao, shenyang, high, speed, railway, the, chinese, government, made, high, speed, rail, construction, a, cornerstone, of, its, economic, stimulus, program, in, order, to, combat, the, effects, of, the, 2008, global, financial, crisis, and, the, result, has, been, a, rapid, development, of, the, chinese, rail, system, into, the, world, s, most, extensive, high, speed, rail, network, by, 2013, the, system, had, 11, 028, km, 6, 852, mi, of, operational, track, accounting, for, about, half, of, the, world, s, total, at, the, time, by, the, end, of, 2018, the, total, high, speed, railway, hsr, in, china, had, risen, to, over, 29, 000, kilometres, 18, 000, miles, over, 1, 71, billion, trips, were, made, in, 2017, more, than, half, of, china, s, total, railway, passenger, delivery, making, it, the, world, s, busiest, network, state, planning, for, high, speed, railway, began, in, the, early, 1990s, and, the, country, s, first, high, speed, rail, line, the, qinhuangdao, shenyang, passenger, railway, was, built, in, 1999, and, opened, to, commercial, operation, in, 2003, this, line, could, accommodate, commercial, trains, running, at, up, to, 200, km, h, 120, mph, planners, also, considered, germany, s, transrapid, maglev, technology, and, built, the, shanghai, maglev, train, which, runs, on, a, 30, 5, km, 19, 0, mi, track, linking, the, pudong, the, city, s, financial, district, and, the, pudong, international, airport, the, maglev, train, service, began, operating, in, 2004, with, trains, reaching, a, top, speed, of, 431, km, h, 268, mph, and, remains, the, fastest, high, speed, service, in, the, world, maglev, however, was, not, adopted, nationally, and, all, subsequent, expansion, features, high, speed, rail, on, conventional, tracks, in, the, 1990s, china, s, domestic, train, production, industry, designed, and, produced, a, series, of, high, speed, train, prototypes, but, few, were, used, in, commercial, operation, and, none, were, mass, produced, the, chinese, ministry, of, railways, mor, then, arranged, for, the, purchase, of, foreign, high, speed, trains, from, french, german, and, japanese, manufacturers, along, with, certain, technology, transfers, and, joint, ventures, with, domestic, trainmakers, in, 2007, the, mor, introduced, the, china, railways, high, speed, crh, service, also, known, as, harmony, trains, a, version, of, the, german, siemens, velaro, high, speed, train, in, 2008, high, speed, trains, began, running, at, a, top, speed, of, 350, km, h, 220, mph, on, the, beijing, tianjin, intercity, railway, which, opened, during, the, 2008, summer, olympics, in, beijing, the, following, year, trains, on, the, newly, opened, wuhan, guangzhou, high, speed, railway, set, a, world, record, for, average, speed, over, an, entire, trip, at, 312, 5, km, h, 194, 2, mph, over, 968, kilometres, 601, miles, a, collision, of, high, speed, trains, on, 23, july, 2011, in, zhejiang, province, killed, 40, and, injured, 195, raising, concerns, about, operational, safety, a, credit, crunch, later, that, year, slowed, the, construction, of, new, lines, in, july, 2011, top, train, speeds, were, lowered, to, 300, km, h, 190, mph, but, by, 2012, the, high, speed, rail, boom, had, renewed, with, new, lines, and, new, rolling, stock, by, domestic, producers, that, had, indigenised, foreign, technology, on, 26, december, 2012, china, opened, the, beijing, guangzhou, shenzhen, hong, kong, high, speed, railway, the, world, s, longest, high, speed, rail, line, which, runs, 2, 208, km, 1, 372, mi, from, beijing, west, railway, station, to, shenzhen, north, railway, station, the, network, set, a, target, to, create, the, 4, 4, national, high, speed, rail, grid, by, 2015, and, continues, to, rapidly, expand, with, the, july, 2016, announcement, of, the, 8, 8, national, high, speed, rail, grid, in, 2017, 350, km, h, 217, mph, services, resumed, on, the, beijing, shanghai, high, speed, railway, once, again, refreshing, the, world, record, for, average, speed, with, select, services, running, between, beijing, south, to, nanjing, south, reaching, average, speeds, of, 317, 7, km, h, 197, 4, mph, in, south, korea, construction, of, the, high, speed, line, from, seoul, to, busan, began, in, 1992, the, seoul, busan, corridor, is, korea, s, busiest, running, between, the, two, largest, cities, in, 1982, it, represented, 65, 8, of, south, korea, s, population, a, number, that, grew, to, 73, 3, by, 1995, along, with, 70, of, freight, traffic, and, 66, of, passenger, traffic, with, both, the, gyeongbu, expressway, and, korail, s, gyeongbu, line, congested, as, of, the, late, 1970s, the, government, saw, the, pressing, need, for, another, form, of, transportation, the, line, known, as, korea, train, express, ktx, was, launched, on, 1, april, 2004, using, french, tgv, technology, top, speed, for, trains, in, regular, service, is, currently, 305, km, h, 190, mph, though, the, infrastructure, is, designed, for, 350, km, h, 220, mph, the, initial, rolling, stock, was, based, on, alstom, s, tgv, r, seau, and, was, partly, built, in, korea, the, domestically, developed, hsr, 350x, which, achieved, 352, 4, km, h, 219, 0, mph, in, tests, resulted, in, a, second, type, of, high, speed, trains, now, operated, by, korail, the, ktx, sancheon, the, next, generation, ktx, train, hemu, 430x, achieved, 421, 4, km, h, 261, 8, mph, in, 2013, making, south, korea, the, world, s, fourth, country, after, france, japan, and, china, to, develop, a, high, speed, train, running, on, conventional, rail, above, 420, km, h, 260, mph, taiwan, high, speed, rail, s, first, and, only, hsr, line, opened, for, service, on, 5, january, 2007, using, japanese, trains, with, a, top, speed, of, 300, km, h, 190, mph, the, service, traverses, 345, km, 214, mi, from, nangang, to, zuoying, in, as, little, as, 105, minutes, while, it, contains, only, one, line, its, route, covers, western, taiwan, where, over, 90, of, taiwan, s, population, live, connecting, most, major, cities, of, taiwan, taipei, new, taipei, taoyuan, hsinchu, taichung, chiayi, tainan, and, kaohsiung, once, thsr, began, operations, almost, all, passengers, switched, from, airlines, flying, parallel, routes, while, road, traffic, was, also, reduced, uzbekistan, opened, the, afrosiyob, 344, km, 214, mi, service, from, tashkent, to, samarkand, in, 2011, which, was, upgraded, in, 2013, to, an, average, operational, speed, of, 160, km, h, 99, mph, and, peak, speed, of, 250, km, h, 160, mph, the, talgo, 250, service, has, been, extended, to, karshi, as, of, august, 2015, whereby, the, train, travels, 450, km, 280, mi, in, 3, hours, as, of, august, 2016, the, train, service, was, extended, to, bukhara, and, the, 600, km, 370, mi, extension, will, take, 3, hours, and, 20, minutes, down, from, 7, hours, as, of, 2022, there, are, no, operational, high, speed, rail, lines, in, egypt, plans, have, been, announced, for, three, lines, aiming, to, connect, the, nile, river, valley, the, mediterranean, coast, and, the, red, sea, construction, had, started, on, at, least, two, lines, in, november, 2007, the, moroccan, government, decided, to, undertake, the, construction, of, a, high, speed, rail, line, between, the, economic, capital, casablanca, and, tangier, one, of, the, largest, harbour, cities, on, the, strait, of, gibraltar, the, line, will, also, serve, the, capital, rabat, and, kenitra, the, first, section, of, the, line, the, 323, kilometre, 201, mi, kenitra, tangier, high, speed, rail, line, was, completed, in, 2018, future, projects, include, expansions, south, to, marrakech, and, agadir, and, east, to, meknes, fes, and, oujda, continuous, welded, rail, is, generally, used, to, reduce, track, vibrations, and, misalignment, almost, all, high, speed, lines, are, electrically, driven, via, overhead, lines, have, in, cab, signalling, and, use, advanced, switches, using, very, low, entry, and, frog, angles, hsr, tracks, may, also, be, designed, to, reduce, vibrations, originating, from, high, speed, rail, use, the, road, rail, parallel, layout, uses, land, beside, highways, for, railway, lines, examples, include, paris, lyon, and, k, ln, frankfurt, in, which, 15, and, 70, of, the, track, runs, beside, highways, respectively, there, are, synergies, to, be, achieved, from, such, a, setup, as, noise, mitigation, measures, for, the, road, benefit, the, railway, and, vice, versa, and, furthermore, less, land, must, be, taken, through, expropriation, as, land, may, have, already, been, acquired, for, the, construction, of, the, other, infrastructure, in, addition, to, that, habitats, of, local, wildlife, are, disrupted, only, once, by, the, combined, rail, road, right, of, way, instead, of, at, multiple, points, however, downsides, include, the, fact, that, roads, usually, allow, steeper, grades, and, sharper, turns, than, high, speed, rail, lines, and, thus, co, locating, them, may, not, always, be, suitable, moreover, both, roads, and, railways, often, make, use, of, narrow, river, valleys, or, mountain, passes, which, do, not, allow, a, lot, of, infrastructure, to, be, sited, next, to, each, other, in, china, high, speed, lines, at, speeds, between, 200, and, 250, km, h, 124, and, 155, mph, may, carry, freight, or, passengers, while, lines, operating, at, speeds, over, 300, km, h, 186, mph, are, used, only, by, passenger, crh, cr, trains, in, the, united, kingdom, hs1, is, also, used, by, regional, trains, run, by, southeastern, at, speeds, of, up, to, 225, km, h, 140, mph, and, occasionally, freight, trains, that, run, to, central, europe, in, germany, some, lines, are, shared, with, inter, city, and, regional, trains, at, day, and, freight, trains, at, night, in, france, some, lines, are, shared, with, regional, trains, that, travel, at, 200, km, h, 124, mph, for, example, ter, nantes, laval, mixing, trains, of, vastly, different, speeds, and, or, stopping, patterns, on, the, same, tracks, drastically, reduces, capacity, so, usually, a, temporal, separation, e, g, freight, trains, use, the, high, speed, line, only, at, night, when, no, or, only, a, few, passenger, trains, operate, is, employed, or, the, slower, train, has, to, wait, at, a, station, or, passing, siding, for, the, faster, train, to, overtake, even, if, the, faster, train, is, delayed, thus, delaying, the, slower, train, too, the, cost, per, kilometre, in, spain, was, estimated, at, between, 9, million, madrid, andaluc, a, and, 22, million, madrid, valladolid, in, italy, the, cost, was, between, 24, million, roma, napoli, and, 68, million, bologna, firenze, in, the, 2010s, costs, per, kilometre, in, france, ranged, from, 18, million, blp, brittany, to, 26, million, sud, europe, atlantique, the, world, bank, estimated, in, 2019, that, the, chinese, hsr, network, was, built, at, an, average, cost, of, 17, 21, million, per, km, all, high, speed, trains, have, been, designed, to, carry, passengers, only, there, are, very, few, high, speed, freight, services, in, the, world, they, all, use, trains, that, were, originally, designed, to, carry, passengers, during, the, planning, of, the, tokaido, shinkansen, the, japanese, national, railways, were, planning, for, freight, services, along, the, route, this, plan, was, discarded, before, the, line, opened, but, since, 2019, light, freight, has, been, carried, on, some, shinkansen, services, the, french, tgv, la, poste, was, for, a, long, time, the, sole, very, high, speed, train, service, transporting, mail, in, france, for, la, poste, at, a, maximum, top, speed, of, 270, kilometers, per, hour, 170, mph, between, 1984, and, 2015, the, trainsets, were, either, specifically, adapted, and, built, either, converted, passenger, tgv, sud, est, trainsets, in, italy, mercitalia, fast, is, a, high, speed, freight, service, launched, in, october, 2018, by, mercitalia, it, uses, converted, passenger, etr, 500, trainsets, to, carry, goods, at, average, speeds, of, 180, km, h, 110, mph, at, first, between, caserta, and, bologna, with, plans, to, extend, the, network, throughout, italy, in, some, countries, high, speed, rail, is, integrated, with, courier, services, to, provide, fast, door, to, door, intercity, deliveries, for, example, china, railways, has, partnered, with, sf, express, for, high, speed, cargo, deliveries, and, deutsche, bahn, offers, express, deliveries, within, germany, as, well, as, to, some, major, cities, outside, the, country, on, the, ice, network, rather, than, using, dedicated, freight, trains, these, use, luggage, racks, and, other, unused, space, in, passenger, trains, non, high, speed, freight, trains, running, on, high, speed, lines, is, much, more, common, for, example, high, speed, 1, sees, weekly, freight, services, however, high, speed, lines, tend, to, be, steeper, than, regular, non, mountain, railways, which, poses, a, problem, for, most, freight, trains, as, they, have, a, lower, power, to, weight, ratio, and, thus, more, difficulty, climbing, steep, slopes, for, example, the, frankfurt, cologne, high, speed, line, has, inclines, up, to, 40, if, a, high, speed, line, through, even, somewhat, hilly, terrain, is, to, be, usable, for, freight, expensive, engineered, structures, will, need, to, be, built, as, is, the, case, with, the, hannover, w, rzburg, high, speed, line, which, contains, the, longest, and, the, second, longest, mainline, rail, tunnel, in, germany, and, altogether, runs, on, tunnels, or, bridges, for, roughly, half, of, its, length, key, technologies, used, in, high, speed, train, rolling, stock, include, tilting, trainsets, aerodynamic, designs, to, reduce, drag, lift, and, noise, air, brakes, regenerative, braking, engine, technology, and, dynamic, weight, shifting, notable, high, speed, train, manufacturers, include, alstom, hitachi, kawasaki, siemens, stadler, rail, and, crrc, while, commercial, high, speed, trains, have, lower, maximum, speeds, than, jet, aircraft, they, offer, shorter, total, trip, times, than, air, travel, for, short, distances, they, typically, connect, city, centre, rail, stations, to, each, other, while, air, transport, connects, airports, that, are, typically, farther, from, city, centres, high, speed, rail, hsr, is, best, suited, for, journeys, of, 1, to, 4, 1, 2, hours, about, 150, 900, km, or, 93, 559, mi, for, which, the, train, can, beat, air, and, car, trip, time, for, trips, under, about, 700, km, 430, mi, the, process, of, checking, in, and, going, through, airport, security, as, well, as, travelling, to, and, from, the, airport, makes, the, total, air, journey, time, equal, to, or, slower, than, hsr, european, authorities, treat, hsr, as, competitive, with, passenger, air, for, hsr, trips, under, 4, 1, 2, hours, hsr, eliminated, air, transport, from, routes, such, as, paris, lyon, paris, brussels, cologne, frankfurt, nanjing, wuhan, chongqing, chengdu, taipei, kaohsiung, tokyo, nagoya, tokyo, sendai, and, tokyo, niigata, while, also, greatly, reducing, air, traffic, on, routes, such, as, amsterdam, brussels, barcelona, madrid, and, naples, rome, milan, china, southern, airlines, china, s, largest, airline, expects, the, construction, of, china, s, high, speed, railway, network, to, impact, through, increased, competition, and, falling, revenues, 25, of, its, route, network, in, the, coming, years, european, data, indicate, that, air, traffic, is, more, sensitive, than, road, traffic, car, and, bus, to, competition, from, hsr, at, least, on, journeys, of, 400, km, 249, mi, and, more, tgv, sud, est, reduced, the, travel, time, paris, lyon, from, almost, four, to, about, two, hours, market, share, rose, from, 40, to, 72, air, and, road, market, shares, shrunk, from, 31, to, 7, and, from, 29, to, 21, respectively, on, the, madrid, seville, link, the, ave, connection, increased, share, from, 16, to, 52, air, traffic, shrunk, from, 40, to, 13, road, traffic, from, 44, to, 36, hence, the, rail, market, amounted, to, 80, of, combined, rail, and, air, traffic, this, figure, increased, to, 89, in, 2009, according, to, spanish, rail, operator, renfe, according, to, peter, jorritsma, the, rail, market, share, s, as, compared, to, planes, can, be, computed, approximately, as, a, function, of, the, travelling, time, in, minutes, t, by, the, logistic, formula, according, to, this, formula, a, journey, time, of, three, hours, yields, a, 65, market, share, not, taking, into, account, any, price, differential, in, tickets, in, japan, there, is, a, so, called, 4, hour, wall, in, high, speed, rail, s, market, share, if, the, high, speed, rail, journey, time, exceeds, 4, hours, then, people, likely, choose, planes, over, high, speed, rail, for, instance, from, tokyo, to, osaka, a, 2h22m, journey, by, shinkansen, high, speed, rail, has, an, 85, market, share, whereas, planes, have, 15, from, tokyo, to, hiroshima, a, 3h44m, journey, by, shinkansen, high, speed, rail, has, a, 67, market, share, whereas, planes, have, 33, the, situation, is, the, reverse, on, the, tokyo, to, fukuoka, route, where, high, speed, rail, takes, 4h47m, and, rail, only, has, 10, market, share, and, planes, 90, in, taiwan, china, airlines, cancelled, all, flights, to, taichung, airport, within, a, year, of, taiwan, high, speed, rail, starting, operations, completion, of, the, high, speed, railway, in, 2007, led, to, drastically, fewer, flights, along, the, island, s, west, coast, with, flights, between, taipei, and, kaohsiung, ceasing, altogether, in, 2012, travel, by, rail, is, more, competitive, in, areas, of, higher, population, density, or, where, gasoline, is, expensive, because, conventional, trains, are, more, fuel, efficient, than, cars, when, ridership, is, high, similar, to, other, forms, of, mass, transit, very, few, high, speed, trains, consume, diesel, or, other, fossil, fuels, but, the, power, stations, that, provide, electric, trains, with, electricity, can, consume, fossil, fuels, in, japan, prior, to, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, disaster, and, france, with, very, extensive, high, speed, rail, networks, a, large, proportion, of, electricity, comes, from, nuclear, power, on, the, eurostar, which, primarily, runs, off, the, french, grid, emissions, from, traveling, by, train, from, london, to, paris, are, 90, lower, than, by, flying, in, germany, 38, 5, of, all, electricity, was, produced, from, renewable, sources, in, 2017, however, railways, run, on, their, own, grid, partially, independent, from, the, general, grid, and, relying, in, part, on, dedicated, power, plants, even, using, electricity, generated, from, coal, fossil, gas, or, oil, high, speed, trains, are, significantly, more, fuel, efficient, per, passenger, per, kilometer, traveled, despite, the, greater, resistance, to, motion, of, the, railcars, at, higher, speeds, than, the, typical, automobile, because, of, economies, of, scale, in, generator, technology, and, trains, themselves, as, well, as, lower, air, friction, and, rolling, resistance, at, the, same, speed, high, speed, rail, can, accommodate, more, passengers, at, far, higher, speeds, than, automobiles, generally, the, longer, the, journey, the, better, the, time, advantage, of, rail, over, the, road, if, going, to, the, same, destination, however, high, speed, rail, can, be, competitive, with, cars, on, shorter, distances, 0, 150, kilometres, 0, 90, mi, for, example, for, commuting, especially, if, the, car, users, experience, road, congestion, or, expensive, parking, fees, in, norway, the, gardermoen, line, has, made, the, rail, market, share, for, passengers, from, oslo, to, the, airport, 42, km, rise, to, 51, in, 2014, compared, to, 17, for, buses, and, 28, for, private, cars, and, taxis, on, such, short, lines, particularly, services, which, call, at, stations, close, to, one, another, the, acceleration, capabilities, of, the, trains, may, be, more, important, than, their, maximum, speed, extreme, commuting, has, been, enabled, by, high, speed, rail, with, commuters, covering, distances, by, rail, daily, that, they, would, not, usually, by, car, furthermore, stations, in, less, densely, populated, areas, within, the, larger, conurbation, of, larger, cities, like, montabaur, railway, station, and, limburg, s, d, railway, station, between, frankfurt, and, cologne, are, attractive, for, commuters, as, the, housing, prices, are, more, affordable, than, in, the, central, cities, even, when, taking, into, account, the, price, of, a, yearly, ticket, for, the, train, consequently, montabaur, has, the, highest, per, capita, rate, of, bahn, card, 100, in, germany, a, ticket, that, allows, unlimited, travel, on, all, trains, in, germany, for, a, fixed, yearly, price, moreover, a, typical, passenger, rail, carries, 2, 83, times, as, many, passengers, per, hour, per, meter, width, as, a, road, a, typical, capacity, is, the, eurostar, which, provides, capacity, for, 12, trains, per, hour, and, 800, passengers, per, train, totaling, 9, 600, passengers, per, hour, in, each, direction, by, contrast, the, highway, capacity, manual, gives, a, maximum, capacity, of, 2, 250, passenger, cars, per, hour, per, lane, excluding, other, vehicles, assuming, an, average, vehicle, occupancy, of, 1, 57, people, a, standard, twin, track, railway, has, a, typical, capacity, 13, greater, than, a, 6, lane, highway, 3, lanes, each, way, while, requiring, only, 40, of, the, land, 1, 0, 3, 0, versus, 2, 5, 7, 5, hectares, per, kilometre, of, direct, indirect, land, consumption, the, tokaido, shinkansen, line, in, japan, has, a, much, higher, ratio, with, as, many, as, 20, 000, passengers, per, hour, per, direction, similarly, commuter, roads, tend, to, carry, fewer, than, 1, 57, persons, per, vehicle, washington, state, department, of, transportation, for, instance, uses, 1, 2, persons, per, vehicle, during, commute, times, compare, this, to, the, capacity, of, typical, small, to, mid, sized, airliners, like, the, airbus, a320, which, in, a, high, density, arrangement, has, 186, seats, or, the, boeing, 737, 800, which, has, an, absolute, maximum, seated, capacity, of, 189, in, a, high, density, single, class, layout, as, employed, for, example, by, ryanair, if, a, business, or, first, class, section, is, provided, those, airliners, will, have, lower, seating, capacities, than, that, high, speed, rail, usually, implements, electric, power, and, therefore, its, energy, sources, can, be, distant, or, renewable, the, usage, of, electric, power, in, high, speed, rails, can, thereby, result, in, a, reduction, of, air, pollutants, as, shown, in, a, case, study, on, china, s, high, speed, railways, throughout, its, development, this, is, an, advantage, over, air, travel, which, currently, uses, fossil, fuels, and, is, a, major, source, of, pollution, studies, regarding, busy, airports, such, as, lax, have, shown, that, over, an, area, of, about, 60, square, kilometres, 23, square, miles, downwind, of, the, airport, where, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, live, or, work, the, particle, number, concentration, was, at, least, twice, that, of, nearby, urban, areas, showing, that, airplane, pollution, far, exceeded, road, pollution, even, from, heavy, freeway, traffic, airplanes, and, airstrips, require, trees, to, be, cut, down, as, they, are, a, nuisance, to, pilots, some, 3, 000, trees, will, be, chopped, due, to, obstruction, issues, at, seattle, tacoma, international, airport, on, the, other, hand, trees, next, to, rail, lines, can, often, become, a, hazard, during, leaf, fall, seasons, with, several, german, media, calling, for, trees, to, be, cut, down, following, autumn, storms, in, 2017, hsr, is, much, simpler, to, control, due, to, its, predictable, course, high, speed, rail, systems, reduce, but, do, not, eliminate, collisions, with, automobiles, or, people, by, using, non, grade, level, track, and, eliminating, grade, level, crossings, to, date, the, only, three, deadly, accidents, involving, a, high, speed, train, on, high, speed, tracks, in, revenue, service, were, the, 1998, eschede, train, disaster, the, 2011, wenzhou, train, collision, in, which, speed, was, not, a, factor, and, the, 2020, livraga, derailment, shinkansen, trains, have, anti, derailment, devices, installed, under, passenger, cars, which, do, not, strictly, prevent, derailment, but, prevent, the, train, from, travelling, a, large, distance, away, from, train, tracks, in, case, a, derailment, occurs, in, general, travel, by, high, speed, rail, has, been, demonstrated, to, be, remarkably, safe, the, first, high, speed, rail, network, the, japanese, shinkansen, has, not, had, any, fatal, accidents, involving, passengers, since, it, began, operating, in, 1964, notable, major, accidents, involving, high, speed, trains, include, the, following, in, 1998, after, over, thirty, years, of, high, speed, rail, operations, worldwide, without, fatal, accidents, the, eschede, accident, occurred, in, germany, a, poorly, designed, ice, 1, wheel, fractured, at, a, speed, of, 200, km, h, 124, mph, near, eschede, resulting, in, the, derailment, and, destruction, of, almost, the, entire, set, of, 16, cars, and, the, deaths, of, 101, people, the, derailment, began, at, a, switch, the, accident, was, made, worse, when, the, derailed, cars, travelling, at, high, speed, struck, and, collapsed, a, road, bridge, located, just, past, the, switch, on, 23, july, 2011, 13, years, after, the, eschede, train, accident, a, chinese, crh2, travelling, at, 100, km, h, 62, mph, collided, with, a, crh1, which, was, stopped, on, a, viaduct, in, the, suburbs, of, wenzhou, zhejiang, province, china, the, two, trains, derailed, and, four, cars, fell, off, the, viaduct, forty, people, were, killed, and, at, least, 192, were, injured, 12, of, them, severely, the, disaster, led, to, a, number, of, changes, in, management, and, exploitation, of, high, speed, rail, in, china, despite, the, fact, that, speed, itself, was, not, a, factor, in, the, cause, of, the, accident, one, of, the, major, changes, was, to, further, lower, the, maximum, speeds, in, high, speed, and, higher, speed, railways, in, china, the, remaining, 350, km, h, 217, mph, becoming, 300, 250, km, h, 155, mph, becoming, 200, and, 200, km, h, 124, mph, becoming, 160, six, years, later, they, started, to, be, restored, to, their, original, high, speeds, in, july, 2013, a, high, speed, train, in, spain, travelling, at, 190, km, h, 120, mph, attempted, to, negotiate, a, curve, whose, speed, limit, is, 80, km, h, 50, mph, the, train, derailed, and, overturned, resulting, in, 78, fatalities, normally, high, speed, rail, has, automatic, speed, limiting, restrictions, but, this, track, section, is, a, conventional, section, and, in, this, case, the, automatic, speed, limit, was, said, to, be, disabled, by, the, driver, several, kilometers, before, the, station, a, few, days, later, the, train, worker, s, union, claimed, that, the, speed, limiter, didn, t, work, properly, because, of, lack, of, proper, funding, acknowledging, the, budget, cuts, made, by, the, current, government, two, days, after, the, accident, the, driver, was, provisionally, charged, with, homicide, by, negligence, this, is, the, first, accident, that, occurred, with, a, spanish, high, speed, train, but, it, occurred, in, a, section, that, was, not, high, speed, and, as, mentioned, safety, equipment, mandatory, on, high, speed, track, would, have, prevented, the, accident, on, 14, november, 2015, a, specialised, tgv, euroduplex, was, performing, commissioning, tests, on, the, unopened, second, phase, of, the, lgv, est, high, speed, line, in, france, when, it, entered, a, curve, overturned, and, struck, the, parapet, of, a, bridge, over, the, marne, rhine, canal, the, rear, power, car, came, to, a, rest, in, the, canal, while, the, remainder, of, the, train, came, to, a, rest, in, the, grassy, median, between, the, northern, and, southern, tracks, approximately, 50, people, were, on, board, consisting, of, sncf, technicians, and, reportedly, some, unauthorised, guests, eleven, were, killed, and, 37, were, injured, the, train, was, performing, tests, at, 10, percent, above, the, planned, speed, limit, for, the, line, and, should, have, slowed, from, 352, km, h, 219, mph, to, 176, km, h, 109, mph, before, entering, the, curve, officials, have, indicated, that, excessive, speed, may, have, caused, the, accident, during, testing, some, safety, features, that, usually, prevent, accidents, like, this, one, are, switched, off, on, 13, december, 2018, a, high, speed, passenger, train, travelling, at, 80, 90, kilometres, per, hour, 50, 56, mph, and, a, locomotive, collided, near, yenimahalle, in, ankara,

speed, train, travelling, at, 300, km, h, 190, mph, derailed, at, livraga, lombardy, italy, the, two, drivers, were, killed, and, a, number, of, passengers, were, injured, the, cause, as, reported, by, investigators, was, that, a, faulty, set, of, junction, points, was, in, the, reverse, position, but, was, reported, by, the, signaling, system, as, being, in, the, normal, i, e, straight, position, high, speed, rail, ridership, has, been, increasing, rapidly, since, 2000, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, the, largest, share, of, ridership, was, on, the, japanese, shinkansen, network, in, 2000, the, shinkansen, was, responsible, for, about, 85, of, the, cumulative, world, ridership, up, to, that, point, this, has, been, progressively, surpassed, by, the, chinese, high, speed, rail, network, which, has, been, the, largest, contributor, of, global, ridership, growth, since, its, inception, as, of, 2018, annual, ridership, of, the, chinese, high, speed, rail, network, is, over, five, times, larger, than, that, of, the, shinkansen, there, are, several, definitions, of, maximum, speed, the, speed, record, for, a, pre, production, unconventional, passenger, train,

the, only, high, speed, line, in, britain, with, an, operating, speed, of, more, than, 125, mph, 201, km, h, the, great, western, main, line, south, wales, main, line, west, coast, main, line, midland, main, line, cross, country, route, and, east, coast, main, line, all, have, maximum, speed, limits, of, 125, mph, 201, km, h, attempts, to, increase, speeds, to, 140, mph, 225, km, h, on, both, the, west, coast, main, line, and, east, coast, main, line, were, abandoned, in, the, 1980s, due, to, trains, operating, on, those, lines, not, being, capable, of, cab, signalling, which, was, made, a, legal, requirement, in, the, uk, for, tracks, permitted, to, operate, any, service, at, speeds, greater, than, 125, mph, 201, km, h, due, to, the, impracticality, of, observing, lineside, signals, at, such, speeds, the, united, states, has, domestic, definitions, for, high, speed, rail, varying, between, jurisdictions, amtrak, s, acela, express, reaching, 150, mph, 240, km, h, northeast, regional, keystone, service, silver, star, vermonter, and, certain, marc, penn, line, express, trains, the, three, reaching, 125, mph, 201, km, h, are, currently, the, only, high, speed, services, on, the, american, continent, according, to, the, american, definition, although, they, are, not, considered, high, speed, by, international, standards, these, services, are, all, limited, to, the, northeast, corridor, the, acela, express, links, boston, new, york, city, philadelphia, baltimore, and, washington, d, c, and, while, northeast, regional, trains, travel, the, whole, of, the, same, route, but, make, more, station, stops, all, other, high, speed, rail, services, travel, over, portions, of, the, route, as, of, 2024, there, are, two, high, speed, rail, projects, under, construction, in, the, united, states, the, california, high, speed, rail, project, eventually, linking, the, 5, largest, cities, in, california, is, planned, to, have, its, first, operating, segment, between, merced, and, bakersfield, begin, passenger, service, as, soon, as, 2030, the, brightline, west, project, is, planned, to, be, privately, operated, and, link, the, las, vegas, valley, and, rancho, cucamonga, in, the, greater, los, angeles, area, with, service, set, to, begin, in, as, soon, as, 2028, with, high, speed, rail, there, has, been, an, increase, in, accessibility, within, cities, it, allows, for, urban, regeneration, accessibility, in, cities, near, and, far, and, efficient, inter, city, relationships, better, inter, city, relationships, lead, to, high, level, services, to, companies, advanced, technology, and, marketing, the, most, important, effect, of, hsr, is, the, increase, of, accessibility, due, to, shorter, travel, times, hsr, lines, have, been, used, to, create, long, distance, routes, which, in, many, cases, cater, to, business, travellers, however, there, have, also, been, short, distance, routes, that, have, revolutionised, the, concepts, of, hsr, they, create, commuting, relationships, between, cities, opening, up, more, opportunities, using, both, longer, distance, and, shorter, distance, rail, in, one, country, allows, for, the, best, case, of, economic, development, widening, the, labor, and, residential, market, of, a, metropolitan, area, and, extending, it, to, smaller, cities, therefore, hsr, is, highly, related, to, urban, development, it, attracts, offices, and, start, ups, induces, industrial, displacement, and, promotes, firm, innovation, the, ktx, incheon, international, airport, to, seoul, line, operates, on, incheon, arex, was, closed, in, 2018, due, to, a, mix, of, issues, including, poor, ridership, and, track, sharing, the, arex, was, not, constructed, as, high, speed, rail, resulting, a, cap, of, 150, km, h, on, ktx, service, in, its, section, in, china, many, conventional, lines, upgraded, up, to, 200, km, h, had, high, speed, services, shifted, to, parallel, high, speed, lines, these, lines, often, passing, through, towns, and, having, level, crossings, are, still, used, for, local, trains, and, freight, trains, for, example, all, passenger, emu, services, on, the, hankou, danjiangkou, railway, were, routed, over, the, wuhan, shiyan, high, speed, railway, on, its, opening, to, free, up, capacity, for, freight, trains, on, the, slower, railway
