a, power, supply, is, an, electrical, device, that, supplies, electric, power, to, an, electrical, load, the, main, purpose, of, a, power, supply, is, to, convert, electric, current, from, a, source, to, the, correct, voltage, current, and, frequency, to, power, the, load, as, a, result, power, supplies, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, electric, power, converters, some, power, supplies, are, separate, standalone, pieces, of, equipment, while, others, are, built, into, the, load, appliances, that, they, power, examples, of, the, latter, include, power, supplies, found, in, desktop, computers, and, consumer, electronics, devices, other, functions, that, power, supplies, may, perform, include, limiting, the, current, drawn, by, the, load, to, safe, levels, shutting, off, the, current, in, the, event, of, an, electrical, fault, power, conditioning, to, prevent, electronic, noise, or, voltage, surges, on, the, input, from, reaching, the, load, power, factor, correction, and, storing, energy, so, it, can, continue, to, power, the, load, in, the, event, of, a, temporary, interruption, in, the, source, power, uninterruptible, power, supply, all, power, supplies, have, a, power, input, connection, which, receives, energy, in, the, form, of, electric, current, from, a, source, and, one, or, more, power, output, or, rail, connections, that, deliver, current, to, the, load, the, source, power, may, come, from, the, electric, power, grid, such, as, an, electrical, outlet, energy, storage, devices, such, as, batteries, or, fuel, cells, generators, or, alternators, solar, power, converters, or, another, power, supply, the, input, and, output, are, usually, hardwired, circuit, connections, though, some, power, supplies, employ, wireless, energy, transfer, to, power, their, loads, without, wired, connections, some, power, supplies, have, other, types, of, inputs, and, outputs, as, well, for, functions, such, as, external, monitoring, and, control, power, supplies, are, categorized, in, various, ways, including, by, functional, features, for, example, a, regulated, power, supply, is, one, that, maintains, constant, output, voltage, or, current, despite, variations, in, load, current, or, input, voltage, conversely, the, output, of, an, unregulated, power, supply, can, change, significantly, when, its, input, voltage, or, load, current, changes, adjustable, power, supplies, allow, the, output, voltage, or, current, to, be, programmed, by, mechanical, controls, e, g, knobs, on, the, power, supply, front, panel, or, by, means, of, a, control, input, or, both, an, adjustable, regulated, power, supply, is, one, that, is, both, adjustable, and, regulated, an, isolated, power, supply, has, a, power, output, that, is, electrically, independent, of, its, power, input, this, is, in, contrast, to, other, power, supplies, that, share, a, common, connection, between, power, input, and, output, power, supplies, are, packaged, in, different, ways, and, classified, accordingly, a, bench, power, supply, is, a, stand, alone, desktop, unit, used, in, applications, such, as, circuit, test, and, development, open, frame, power, supplies, have, only, a, partial, mechanical, enclosure, sometimes, consisting, of, only, a, mounting, base, these, are, typically, built, into, machinery, or, other, equipment, rack, mount, power, supplies, are, designed, to, be, secured, into, standard, electronic, equipment, racks, an, integrated, power, supply, is, one, that, shares, a, common, printed, circuit, board, with, its, load, an, external, power, supply, ac, adapter, or, power, brick, is, a, power, supply, located, in, the, load, s, ac, power, cord, that, plugs, into, a, wall, outlet, a, wall, wart, is, an, external, supply, integrated, with, the, outlet, plug, itself, these, are, popular, in, consumer, electronics, because, of, their, safety, the, hazardous, 120, or, 240, volt, main, current, is, transformed, down, to, a, safer, voltage, before, it, enters, the, appliance, body, power, supplies, can, be, broadly, divided, into, linear, and, switching, types, linear, power, converters, process, the, input, power, directly, with, all, active, power, conversion, components, operating, in, their, linear, operating, regions, in, switching, power, converters, the, input, power, is, converted, to, ac, or, to, dc, pulses, before, processing, by, components, that, operate, predominantly, in, non, linear, modes, e, g, transistors, that, spend, most, of, their, time, in, cutoff, or, saturation, power, is, lost, converted, to, heat, when, components, operate, in, their, linear, regions, and, consequently, switching, converters, are, usually, more, efficient, than, linear, converters, because, their, components, spend, less, time, in, linear, operating, regions, an, ac, to, dc, power, supply, operates, on, an, ac, input, voltage, and, generates, a, dc, output, voltage, depending, on, application, requirements, the, output, voltage, may, contain, large, or, negligible, amounts, of, ac, frequency, components, known, as, ripple, voltage, related, to, ac, input, voltage, frequency, and, the, power, supply, s, operation, a, dc, power, supply, operating, on, dc, input, voltage, is, called, a, dc, to, dc, converter, this, section, focuses, mostly, on, the, ac, to, dc, variant, in, a, linear, power, supply, the, ac, input, voltage, passes, through, a, power, transformer, and, is, then, rectified, and, filtered, to, obtain, a, dc, voltage, the, filtering, reduces, the, amplitude, of, ac, mains, frequency, present, in, the, rectifier, output, and, can, be, as, simple, as, a, single, capacitor, or, more, complex, such, as, a, pi, filter, the, electric, load, s, tolerance, of, ripple, dictates, the, minimum, amount, of, filtering, that, must, be, provided, by, the, power, supply, in, some, applications, ripple, can, be, entirely, ignored, for, example, in, some, battery, charging, applications, the, power, supply, consists, of, just, a, transformer, and, a, diode, with, a, simple, resistor, placed, at, the, power, supply, output, to, limit, the, charging, current, in, a, switched, mode, power, supply, smps, the, ac, mains, input, is, directly, rectified, and, then, filtered, to, obtain, a, dc, voltage, the, resulting, dc, voltage, is, then, switched, on, and, off, at, a, high, frequency, by, electronic, switching, circuitry, thus, producing, an, ac, current, that, will, pass, through, a, high, frequency, transformer, or, inductor, switching, occurs, at, a, very, high, frequency, typically, 10, khz, 1, mhz, thereby, enabling, the, use, of, transformers, and, filter, capacitors, that, are, much, smaller, lighter, and, less, expensive, than, those, found, in, linear, power, supplies, operating, at, mains, frequency, after, the, inductor, or, transformer, secondary, the, high, frequency, ac, is, rectified, and, filtered, to, produce, the, dc, output, voltage, if, the, smps, uses, an, adequately, insulated, high, frequency, transformer, the, output, will, be, electrically, isolated, from, the, mains, this, feature, is, often, essential, for, safety, switched, mode, power, supplies, are, usually, regulated, and, to, keep, the, output, voltage, constant, the, power, supply, employs, a, feedback, controller, that, monitors, current, drawn, by, the, load, the, switching, duty, cycle, increases, as, power, output, requirements, increase, smpss, often, include, safety, features, such, as, current, limiting, or, a, crowbar, circuit, to, help, protect, the, device, and, the, user, from, harm, in, the, event, that, an, abnormal, high, current, power, draw, is, detected, the, switched, mode, supply, can, assume, this, is, a, direct, short, and, will, shut, itself, down, before, damage, is, done, pc, power, supplies, often, provide, a, power, good, signal, to, the, motherboard, the, absence, of, this, signal, prevents, operation, when, abnormal, supply, voltages, are, present, some, smpss, have, an, absolute, limit, on, their, minimum, current, output, they, are, only, able, to, output, above, a, certain, power, level, and, cannot, function, below, that, point, in, a, no, load, condition, the, frequency, of, the, power, slicing, circuit, increases, to, great, speed, causing, the, isolated, transformer, to, act, as, a, tesla, coil, causing, damage, due, to, the, resulting, very, high, voltage, power, spikes, switched, mode, supplies, with, protection, circuits, may, briefly, turn, on, but, then, shut, down, when, no, load, has, been, detected, a, very, small, low, power, dummy, load, such, as, a, ceramic, power, resistor, or, 10, watt, light, bulb, can, be, attached, to, the, supply, to, allow, it, to, run, with, no, primary, load, attached, the, switch, mode, power, supplies, used, in, computers, have, historically, had, low, power, factors, and, have, also, been, significant, sources, of, line, interference, due, to, induced, power, line, harmonics, and, transients, in, simple, switch, mode, power, supplies, the, input, stage, may, distort, the, line, voltage, waveform, which, can, adversely, affect, other, loads, and, result, in, poor, power, quality, for, other, utility, customers, and, cause, unnecessary, heating, in, wires, and, distribution, equipment, furthermore, customers, incur, higher, electric, bills, when, operating, lower, power, factor, loads, to, circumvent, these, problems, some, computer, switch, mode, power, supplies, perform, power, factor, correction, and, may, employ, input, filters, or, additional, switching, stages, to, reduce, line, interference, a, capacitive, power, supply, transformerless, power, supply, uses, the, reactance, of, a, capacitor, to, reduce, the, mains, voltage, to, a, smaller, ac, voltage, typically, the, resulting, reduced, ac, voltage, is, then, rectified, filtered, and, regulated, to, produce, a, constant, dc, output, voltage, the, output, voltage, is, not, isolated, from, the, mains, consequently, to, avoid, exposing, people, and, equipment, from, hazardous, high, voltage, anything, connected, to, the, power, supply, must, be, reliably, insulated, the, voltage, reduction, capacitor, must, withstand, the, full, mains, voltage, and, it, must, also, have, enough, capacitance, to, support, maximum, load, current, at, the, rated, output, voltage, taken, together, these, constraints, limit, practical, uses, of, this, type, of, supply, to, low, power, applications, the, function, of, a, linear, voltage, regulator, is, to, convert, a, varying, dc, voltage, to, a, constant, often, specific, lower, dc, voltage, in, addition, they, often, provide, a, current, limiting, function, to, protect, the, power, supply, and, load, from, overcurrent, excessive, potentially, destructive, current, a, constant, output, voltage, is, required, in, many, power, supply, applications, but, the, voltage, provided, by, many, energy, sources, will, vary, with, changes, in, load, impedance, furthermore, when, an, unregulated, dc, power, supply, is, the, energy, source, its, output, voltage, will, also, vary, with, changing, input, voltage, to, circumvent, this, some, power, supplies, use, a, linear, voltage, regulator, to, maintain, the, output, voltage, at, a, steady, value, independent, of, fluctuations, in, input, voltage, and, load, impedance, linear, regulators, can, also, reduce, the, magnitude, of, ripple, and, noise, on, the, output, voltage, an, ac, power, supply, typically, takes, the, voltage, from, a, wall, outlet, mains, supply, and, uses, a, transformer, to, step, up, or, step, down, the, voltage, to, the, desired, voltage, some, filtering, may, take, place, as, well, in, some, cases, the, source, voltage, is, the, same, as, the, output, voltage, this, is, called, an, isolation, transformer, other, ac, power, supply, transformers, do, not, provide, mains, isolation, these, are, called, autotransformers, a, variable, output, autotransformer, is, known, as, a, variac, other, kinds, of, ac, power, supplies, are, designed, to, provide, a, nearly, constant, current, and, output, voltage, may, vary, depending, on, impedance, of, the, load, in, cases, when, the, power, source, is, direct, current, like, an, automobile, storage, battery, an, inverter, and, step, up, transformer, may, be, used, to, convert, it, to, ac, power, portable, ac, power, may, be, provided, by, an, alternator, powered, by, a, diesel, or, gasoline, engine, for, example, at, a, construction, site, in, an, automobile, or, boat, or, backup, power, generation, for, emergency, services, whose, current, is, passed, to, a, regulator, circuit, to, provide, a, constant, voltage, at, the, output, some, kinds, of, ac, power, conversion, do, not, use, a, transformer, if, the, output, voltage, and, input, voltage, are, the, same, and, primary, purpose, of, the, device, is, to, filter, ac, power, it, may, be, called, a, line, conditioner, if, the, device, is, designed, to, provide, backup, power, it, may, be, called, an, uninterruptible, power, supply, a, circuit, may, be, designed, with, a, voltage, multiplier, topology, to, directly, step, up, ac, power, formerly, such, an, application, was, a, vacuum, tube, ac, dc, receiver, in, modern, use, ac, power, supplies, can, be, divided, into, single, phase, and, three, phase, systems, ac, power, supplies, can, also, be, used, to, change, the, frequency, as, well, as, the, voltage, they, are, often, used, by, manufacturers, to, check, the, suitability, of, their, products, for, use, in, other, countries, 230, v, 50, hz, or, 115, 60, hz, or, even, 400, hz, for, avionics, testing, an, ac, adapter, is, a, power, supply, built, into, an, ac, mains, power, plug, ac, adapters, are, also, known, by, various, other, names, such, as, plug, pack, or, plug, in, adapter, or, by, slang, terms, such, as, wall, wart, ac, adapters, typically, have, a, single, ac, or, dc, output, that, is, conveyed, over, a, hardwired, cable, to, a, connector, but, some, adapters, have, multiple, outputs, that, may, be, conveyed, over, one, or, more, cables, universal, ac, adapters, have, interchangeable, input, connectors, to, accommodate, different, ac, mains, voltages, adapters, with, ac, outputs, may, consist, only, of, a, passive, transformer, in, case, of, dc, output, adapters, consist, of, either, transformer, with, few, diodes, and, capacitors, or, they, may, employ, switch, mode, power, supply, circuitry, ac, adapters, consume, power, and, produce, electric, and, magnetic, fields, even, when, not, connected, to, a, load, for, this, reason, they, are, sometimes, known, as, electricity, vampires, and, may, be, plugged, into, power, strips, to, allow, them, to, be, conveniently, turned, on, and, off, a, programmable, power, supply, pps, is, one, that, allows, remote, control, of, its, operation, through, an, analog, input, or, digital, interface, such, as, rs, 232, or, gpib, controlled, properties, may, include, voltage, current, and, in, the, case, of, ac, output, power, supplies, frequency, they, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, including, automated, equipment, testing, crystal, growth, monitoring, semiconductor, fabrication, and, x, ray, generators,

proprietary, communication, protocols, or, standard, protocols, and, device, control, languages, such, as, scpi, an, uninterruptible, power, supply, ups, takes, its, power, from, two, or, more, sources, simultaneously, it, is, usually, powered, directly, from, the, ac, mains, while, simultaneously, charging, a, storage, battery, should, there, be, a, dropout, or, failure, of, the, mains, the, battery, instantly, takes, over, so, that, the, load, never, experiences, an, interruption, instantly, here, should, be, defined, as, the, speed, of, electricity, within, conductors, which, is, somewhat, near, the, speed, of, light, that, definition, is, important, because, transmission, of, high, speed, data, and, communications, service, must, have, continuity, no, break, of, that, service, some, manufacturers, use, a, quasi, standard, of, 4, milliseconds, however, with, high, speed, data, even, 4, ms, of, time, in, transitioning, from, one, source, to, another, is, not, fast, enough, the, transition, must, be, made, in, a, break, before, make, method, the, ups, meeting, that, requirement, is, referred, to, as, a, true, ups, or, a, hybrid, ups, how, much, time, the, ups, will, provide, is, most, often, based, on, batteries, and, in, conjunction, with, generators, that, time, can, range, from, a, quasi, minimum, 5, to, 15, minutes, to, hours, or, even, days, in, many, computer, installations, it, is, only, enough, time, on, batteries, to, give, the, operators, time, to, shut, down, the, system, in, an, orderly, way, other, ups, schemes, may, use, an, internal, combustion, engine, or, turbine, to, supply, power, during, a, utility, power, outage, and, the, amount, of, battery, time, is, then, dependent, upon, how, long, it, takes, the, generator, to, be, on, line, and, the, criticality, of, the, equipment, served, such, a, scheme, is, found, in, hospitals, data, centers, call, centers, cell, sites, and, telephone, central, offices, a, high, voltage, power, supply, is, one, that, outputs, hundreds, or, thousands, of, volts, a, special, output, connector, is, used, that, prevents, arcing, insulation, breakdown, and, accidental, human, contact, federal, standard, connectors, are, typically, used, for, applications, above, 20, kv, though, other, types, of, connectors, e, g, shv, connector, may, be, used, at, lower, voltages, some, high, voltage, power, supplies, provide, an, analog, input, or, digital, communication, interface, that, can, be, used, to, control, the, output, voltage, high, voltage, power, supplies, are, commonly, used, to, accelerate, and, manipulate, electron, and, ion, beams, in, equipment, such, as, x, ray, generators, electron, microscopes, and, focused, ion, beam, columns, and, in, a, variety, of, other, applications, including, electrophoresis, and, electrostatics, high, voltage, power, supplies, typically, apply, the, bulk, of, their, input, energy, to, a, power, inverter, which, in, turn, drives, a, voltage, multiplier, or, a, high, turns, ratio, high, voltage, transformer, or, both, usually, a, transformer, followed, by, a, multiplier, to, produce, high, voltage, the, high, voltage, is,

low, voltage, circuitry, the, metering, signal, is, used, by, a, closed, loop, controller, that, regulates, the, high, voltage, by, controlling, inverter, input, power, and, it, may, also, be, conveyed, out, of, the, power, supply, to, allow, external, circuitry, to, monitor, the, high, voltage, output, a, bipolar, power, supply, operates, in, all, four, quadrants, of, the, voltage, current, cartesian, plane, meaning, that, it, will, generate, positive, and, negative, voltages, and, currents, as, required, to, maintain, regulation, when, its, output, is, controlled, by, a, low, level, analog, signal, it, is, effectively, a, low, bandwidth, operational, amplifier, with, high, output, power, and, seamless, zero, crossings, this, type, of, power, supply, is, commonly, used, to, power, magnetic, devices, in, scientific, applications, the, suitability, of, a, particular, power, supply, for, an, application, is, determined, by, various, attributes, of, the, power, supply, which, are, typically, listed, in, the, power, supply, s, specification, commonly, specified, attributes, for, a, power, supply, include, commonly, used, abbreviations, used, in, power, supply, specifications, the, power, supply, of, an, electrical, system, tends, to, generate, heat, the, higher, the, efficiency, the, less, heat, is, generated, by, the, power, supply, there, are, many, ways, to, manage, the, heat, of, a, power, supply, unit, the, types, of, cooling, generally, fall, into, two, categories, convection, and, conduction, common, convection, methods, for, cooling, electronic,

mechanisms, for, overload, protection, a, fuse, contains, a, short, piece, of, wire, which, melts, if, too, much, current, flows, this, effectively, disconnects, the, power, supply, from, its, load, and, the, equipment, stops, working, until, the, problem, that, caused, the, overload, is, identified, and, the, fuse, is, replaced, some, power, supplies, use, a, very, thin, wire, link, soldered, in, place, as, a, fuse, fuses, in, power, supply, units, may, be, replaceable, by, the, end, user, but, fuses, in, consumer, equipment, may, require, tools, to, access, and, change, a, circuit, breaker, contains, an, element, that, heats, bends, and, triggers, a, spring, which, shuts, the, circuit, down, once, the, element, cools, and, the, problem, is, identified, the, breaker, can, be, reset, and, the, power, restored, some, psus, use, a, thermal, cutout, buried, in, the, transformer, rather, than, a, fuse, the, advantage, is, it, allows, greater, current, to, be, drawn, for, limited, time, than, the, unit, can, supply, continuously, some, such, cutouts, are, self, resetting, some, are, single, use, only, some, supplies, use, current, limiting, instead, of, cutting, off, power, if, overloaded, the, two, types, of, current, limiting, used, are, electronic, limiting, and, impedance, limiting, the, former, is, common, on, lab, bench, psus, the, latter, is, common, on, supplies, of, less, than, 3, watts, output, a, foldback, current, limiter, reduces, the, output, current, to, much, less, than, the, maximum, non, fault, current, power, supplies, are, a, fundamental, component, of, many, electronic, devices, and, therefore, used, in, a, diverse, range, of, applications, this, list, is, a, small, sample, of, the, many, applications, of, power, supplies, a, modern, computer, power, supply, is, a, switch, mode, power, supply, that, converts, ac, power, from, the, mains, supply, to, several, dc, voltages, switch, mode, supplies, replaced, linear, supplies, due, to, cost, weight, efficiency, and, size, improvements, the, diverse, collection, of, output, voltages, also, have, widely, varying, current, draw, requirements, electric, vehicles, are, those, which, rely, on, energy, created, through, electricity, generation, a, power, supply, unit, is, part, of, the, necessary, design, to, convert, high, voltage, vehicle, battery, power, arc, welding, uses, electricity, to, join, metals, by, melting, them, the, electricity, is, provided, by, a, welding, power, supply, and, can, either, be, ac, or, dc, arc, welding, requires, high, currents, typically, between, 100, and, 350, amperes, some, types, of, welding, can, use, as, few, as, 10, amperes, while, some, applications, of, spot, welding, employ, currents, as, high, as, 60, 000, amperes, for, an, extremely, short, time, welding, power, supplies, consisted, of, transformers, or, engines, driving, generators, modern, welding, equipment, uses, semiconductors, and, may, include, microprocessor, control, both, commercial, and, military, avionic, systems, require, either, a, dc, dc, or, ac, dc, power, supply, to, convert, energy, into, usable, voltage, these, may, often, operate, at, 400, hz, in, the, interest, of, weight, savings, this, refers, to, conveyors, assembly, lines, bar, code, readers, cameras, motors, pumps, semi, fabricated, manufacturing, and, more, these, include, ventilators, infusion, pumps, surgical, and, dental, instruments, imaging, and, beds
