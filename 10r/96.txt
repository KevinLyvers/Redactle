electronic, mail, email, or, e, mail, is, a, method, of, transmitting, and, receiving, messages, using, electronic, devices, it, was, conceived, in, the, late, 20th, century, as, the, digital, version, of, or, counterpart, to, mail, hence, e, mail, email, is, a, ubiquitous, and, very, widely, used, communication, medium, in, current, use, an, email, address, is, often, treated, as, a, basic, and, necessary, part, of, many, processes, in, business, commerce, government, education, entertainment, and, other, spheres, of, daily, life, in, most, countries, email, operates, across, computer, networks, primarily, the, internet, and, also, local, area, networks, today, s, email, systems, are, based, on, a, store, and, forward, model, email, servers, accept, forward, deliver, and, store, messages, neither, the, users, nor, their, computers, are, required, to, be, online, simultaneously, they, need, to, connect, typically, to, a, mail, server, or, a, webmail, interface, to, send, or, receive, messages, or, download, it, originally, an, ascii, text, only, communications, medium, internet, email, was, extended, by, multipurpose, internet, mail, extensions, mime, to, carry, text, in, other, character, sets, and, multimedia, content, attachments, international, email, with, internationalized, email, addresses, using, utf, 8, is, standardized, but, not, widely, adopted, the, term, electronic, mail, has, been, in, use, with, its, modern, meaning, since, 1975, and, variations, of, the, shorter, e, mail, have, been, in, use, since, 1979, the, service, is, often, simply, referred, to, as, mail, and, a, single, piece, of, electronic, mail, is, called, a, message, the, conventions, for, fields, within, emails, the, to, from, cc, bcc, etc, began, with, rfc, 680, in, 1975, an, internet, email, consists, of, an, envelope, and, content, the, content, consists, of, a, header, and, a, body, computer, based, messaging, between, users, of, the, same, system, became, possible, after, the, advent, of, time, sharing, in, the, early, 1960s, with, a, notable, implementation, by, mit, s, ctss, project, in, 1965, most, developers, of, early, mainframes, and, minicomputers, developed, similar, but, generally, incompatible, mail, applications, in, 1971, the, first, arpanet, network, mail, was, sent, introducing, the, now, familiar, address, syntax, with, the, symbol, designating, the, user, s, system, address, over, a, series, of, rfcs, conventions, were, refined, for, sending, mail, messages, over, the, file, transfer, protocol, proprietary, electronic, mail, systems, soon, began, to, emerge, ibm, compuserve, and, xerox, used, in, house, mail, systems, in, the, 1970s, compuserve, sold, a, commercial, intraoffice, mail, product, in, 1978, to, ibm, and, to, xerox, from, 1981, dec, s, all, in, 1, and, hewlett, packard, s, hpmail, later, hp, deskmanager, were, released, in, 1982, development, work, on, the, former, began, in, the, late, 1970s, and, the, latter, became, the, world, s, largest, selling, email, system, the, simple, mail, transfer, protocol, smtp, was, implemented, on, the, arpanet, in, 1983, lan, email, systems, emerged, in, the, mid, 1980s, for, a, time, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, it, seemed, likely, that, either, a, proprietary, commercial, system, or, the, x, 400, email, system, part, of, the, government, open, systems, interconnection, profile, gosip, would, predominate, however, once, the, final, restrictions, on, carrying, commercial, traffic, over, the, internet, ended, in, 1995, a, combination, of, factors, made, the, current, internet, suite, of, smtp, pop3, and, imap, email, protocols, the, standard, see, protocol, wars, the, following, is, a, typical, sequence, of, events, that, takes, place, when, sender, alice, transmits, a, message, using, a, mail, user, agent, mua, addressed, to, the, email, address, of, the, recipient, in, addition, to, this, example, alternatives, and, complications, exist, in, the, email, system, many, mtas, used, to, accept, messages, for, any, recipient, on, the, internet, and, do, their, best, to, deliver, them, such, mtas, are, called, open, mail, relays, this, was, very, important, in, the, early, days, of, the, internet, when, network, connections, were, unreliable, however, this, mechanism, proved, to, be, exploitable, by, originators, of, unsolicited, bulk, email, and, as, a, consequence, open, mail, relays, have, become, rare, and, many, mtas, do, not, accept, messages, from, open, mail, relays, the, basic, internet, message, format, used, for, email, is, defined, by, rfc, 5322, with, encoding, of, non, ascii, data, and, multimedia, content, attachments, defined, in, rfc, 2045, through, rfc, 2049, collectively, called, multipurpose, internet, mail, extensions, or, mime, the, extensions, in, international, email, apply, only, to, email, rfc, 5322, replaced, the, earlier, rfc, 822, in, 2008, then, rfc, 2822, in, 2001, replaced, rfc, 822, the, standard, for, internet, email, for, decades, published, in, 1982, rfc, 822, was, based, on, the, earlier, rfc, 733, for, the, arpanet, internet, email, messages, consist, of, two, sections, header, and, body, these, are, known, as, content, the, header, is, structured, into, fields, such, as, from, to, cc, subject, date, and, other, information, about, the, email, in, the, process, of, transporting, email, messages, between, systems, smtp, communicates, delivery, parameters, and, information, using, message, header, fields, the, body, contains, the, message, as, unstructured, text, sometimes, containing, a, signature, block, at, the, end, the, header, is, separated, from, the, body, by, a, blank, line, rfc, 5322, specifies, the, syntax, of, the, email, header, each, email, message, has, a, header, the, header, section, of, the, message, according, to, the, specification, comprising, a, number, of, fields, header, fields, each, field, has, a, name, field, name, or, header, field, name, followed, by, the, separator, character, and, a, value, field, body, or, header, field, body, each, field, name, begins, in, the, first, character, of, a, new, line, in, the, header, section, and, begins, with, a, non, whitespace, printable, character, it, ends, with, the, separator, character, the, separator, is, followed, by, the, field, value, the, field, body, the, value, can, continue, onto, subsequent, lines, if, those, lines, have, space, or, tab, as, their, first, character, field, names, and, without, smtputf8, field, bodies, are, restricted, to, 7, bit, ascii, characters, some, non, ascii, values, may, be, represented, using, mime, encoded, words, email, header, fields, can, be, multi, line, with, each, line, recommended, to, be, no, more, than, 78, characters, although, the, limit, is, 998, characters, header, fields, defined, by, rfc, 5322, contain, only, us, ascii, characters, for, encoding, characters, in, other, sets, a, syntax, specified, in, rfc, 2047, may, be, used, in, some, examples, the, ietf, eai, working, group, defines, some, standards, track, extensions, replacing, previous, experimental, extensions, so, utf, 8, encoded, unicode, characters, may, be, used, within, the, header, in, particular, this, allows, email, addresses, to, use, non, ascii, characters, such, addresses, are, supported, by, google, and, microsoft, products, and, promoted, by, some, government, agents, the, message, header, must, include, at, least, the, following, fields, rfc, 3864, describes, registration, procedures, for, message, header, fields, at, the, iana, it, provides, for, permanent, and, provisional, field, names, including, also, fields, defined, for, mime, netnews, and, http, and, referencing, relevant, rfcs, common, header, fields, for, email, include, the, to, field, may, be, unrelated, to, the, addresses, to, which, the, message, is, delivered, the, delivery, list, is, supplied, separately, to, the, transport, protocol, smtp, which, may, be, extracted, from, the, header, content, the, to, field, is, similar, to, the, addressing, at, the, top, of, a, conventional, letter, delivered, according, to, the, address, on, the, outer, envelope, in, the, same, way, the, from, field, may, not, be, the, sender, some, mail, servers, apply, email, authentication, systems, to, messages, relayed, data, pertaining, to, the, server, s, activity, is, also, part, of, the, header, as, defined, below, smtp, defines, the, trace, information, of, a, message, saved, in, the, header, using, the, following, two, fields, other, fields, added, on, top, of, the, header, by, the, receiving, server, may, be, called, trace, fields, internet, email, was, designed, for, 7, bit, ascii, most, email, software, is, 8, bit, clean, but, must, assume, it, will, communicate, with, 7, bit, servers, and, mail, readers, the, mime, standard, introduced, character, set, specifiers, and, two, content, transfer, encodings, to, enable, transmission, of, non, ascii, data, quoted, printable, for, mostly, 7, bit, content, with, a, few, characters, outside, that, range, and, base64, for, arbitrary, binary, data, the, 8bitmime, and, binary, extensions, were, introduced, to, allow, transmission, of, mail, without, the, need, for, these, encodings, but, many, mail, transport, agents, may, not, support, them, in, some, countries, e, mail, software, violates, rfc, 5322, by, sending, raw, non, ascii, text, and, several, encoding, schemes, co, exist, as, a, result, by, default, the, message, in, a, non, latin, alphabet, language, appears, in, non, readable, form, the, only, exception, is, a, coincidence, if, the, sender, and, receiver, use, the, same, encoding, scheme, therefore, for, international, character, sets, unicode, is, growing, in, popularity, most, modern, graphic, email, clients, allow, the, use, of, either, plain, text, or, html, for, the, message, body, at, the, option, of, the, user, html, email, messages, often, include, an, automatic, generated, plain, text, copy, for, compatibility, advantages, of, html, include, the, ability, to, include, in, line, links, and, images, set, apart, previous, messages, in, block, quotes, wrap, naturally, on, any, display, use, emphasis, such, as, underlines, and, italics, and, change, font, styles, disadvantages, include, the, increased, size, of, the, email, privacy, concerns, about, web, bugs, abuse, of, html, email, as, a, vector, for, phishing, attacks, and, the, spread, of, malicious, software, some, e, mail, clients, interpret, the, body, as, html, even, in, the, absence, of, a, content, type, html, header, field, this, may, cause, various, problems, some, web, based, mailing, lists, recommend, all, posts, be, made, in, plain, text, with, 72, or, 80, characters, per, line, for, all, the, above, reasons, and, because, they, have, a, significant, number, of, readers, using, text, based, email, clients, such, as, mutt, various, informal, conventions, evolved, for, marking, up, plain, text, in, email, and, usenet, posts, which, later, led, to, the, development, of, formal, languages, like, setext, c, 1992, and, many, others, the, most, popular, of, them, being, markdown, some, microsoft, email, clients, may, allow, rich, formatting, using, their, proprietary, rich, text, format, rtf, but, this, should, be, avoided, unless, the, recipient, is, guaranteed, to, have, a, compatible, email, client, messages, are, exchanged, between, hosts, using, the, simple, mail, transfer, protocol, with, software, programs, called, mail, transfer, agents, mtas, and, delivered, to, a, mail, store, by, programs, called, mail, delivery, agents, mdas, also, sometimes, called, local, delivery, agents, ldas, accepting, a, message, obliges, an, mta, to, deliver, it, and, when, a, message, cannot, be, delivered, that, mta, must, send, a, bounce, message, back, to, the, sender, indicating, the, problem, users, can, retrieve, their, messages, from, servers, using, standard, protocols, such, as, pop, or, imap, or, as, is, more, likely, in, a, large, corporate, environment, with, a, proprietary, protocol, specific, to, novell, groupwise, lotus, notes, or, microsoft, exchange, servers, programs, used, by, users, for, retrieving, reading, and, managing, email, are, called, mail, user, agents, muas, when, opening, an, email, it, is, marked, as, read, which, typically, visibly, distinguishes, it, from, unread, messages, on, clients, user, interfaces, email, clients, may, allow, hiding, read, emails, from, the, inbox, so, the, user, can, focus, on, the, unread, mail, can, be, stored, on, the, client, on, the, server, side, or, in, both, places, standard, formats, for, mailboxes, include, maildir, and, mbox, several, prominent, email, clients, use, their, own, proprietary, format, and, require, conversion, software, to, transfer, email, between, them, server, side, storage, is, often, in, a, proprietary, format, but, since, access, is, through, a, standard, protocol, such, as, imap, moving, email, from, one, server, to, another, can, be, done, with, any, mua, supporting, the, protocol, many, current, email, users, do, not, run, mta, mda, or, mua, programs, themselves, but, use, a, web, based, email, platform, such, as, gmail, or, yahoo, mail, that, performs, the, same, tasks, such, webmail, interfaces, allow, users, to, access, their, mail, with, any, standard, web, browser, from, any, computer, rather, than, relying, on, a, local, email, client, upon, reception, of, email, messages, email, client, applications, save, messages, in, operating, system, files, in, the, file, system, some, clients, save, individual, messages, as, separate, files, while, others, use, various, database, formats, often, proprietary, for, collective, storage, a, historical, standard, of, storage, is, the, mbox, format, the, specific, format, used, is, often, indicated, by, special, filename, extensions, some, applications, like, apple, mail, leave, attachments, encoded, in, messages, for, searching, while, also, saving, separate, copies, of, the, attachments, others, separate, attachments, from, messages, and, save, them, in, a, specific, directory, the, uri, scheme, as, registered, with, the, iana, defines, the, mailto, scheme, for, smtp, email, addresses, though, its, use, is, not, strictly, defined, urls, of, this, form, are, intended, to, be, used, to, open, the, new, message, window, of, the, user, s, mail, client, when, the, url, is, activated, with, the, address, as, defined, by, the, url, in, the, to, field, many, clients, also, support, query, string, parameters, for, the, other, email, fields, such, as, its, subject, line, or, carbon, copy, recipients, many, email, providers, have, a, web, based, email, client, this, allows, users, to, log, into, the, email, account, by, using, any, compatible, web, browser, to, send, and, receive, their, email, mail, is, typically, not, downloaded, to, the, web, client, so, it, cannot, be, read, without, a, current, internet, connection, the, post, office, protocol, 3, pop3, is, a, mail, access, protocol, used, by, a, client, application, to, read, messages, from, the, mail, server, received, messages, are, often, deleted, from, the, server, pop, supports, simple, download, and, delete, requirements, for, access, to, remote, mailboxes, termed, maildrop, in, the, pop, rfc, s, pop3, allows, downloading, messages, on, a, local, computer, and, reading, them, even, when, offline, the, internet, message, access, protocol, imap, provides, features, to, manage, a, mailbox, from, multiple, devices, small, portable, devices, like, smartphones, are, increasingly, used, to, check,

programming, interface, mapi, is, used, by, microsoft, outlook, to, communicate, to, microsoft, exchange, server, and, to, a, range, of, other, email, server, products, such, as, axigen, mail, server, kerio, connect, scalix, zimbra, hp, openmail, ibm, lotus, notes, zarafa, and, bynari, where, vendors, have, added, mapi, support, to, allow, their, products, to, be, accessed, directly, via, outlook, email, has, been, widely, accepted, by, businesses, governments, and, non, governmental, organizations, in, the, developed, world, and, it, is, one, of, the, key, parts, of, an, e, revolution, in, workplace, communication, with, the, other, key, plank, being, widespread, adoption, of, highspeed, internet, a, sponsored, 2010, study, on, workplace, communication, found, 83, of, u, s, knowledge, workers, felt, email, was, critical, to, their, success, and, productivity, at, work, it, has, some, key, benefits, to, business, and, other, organizations, including, email, marketing, via, opt, in, is, often, successfully, used, to, send, special, sales, offerings, and, new, product, information, depending, on, the, recipient, s, culture, email, sent, without, permission, such, as, an, opt, in, is, likely, to, be, viewed, as, unwelcome, email, spam, many, users, access, their, personal, emails, from, friends, and, family, members, using, a, personal, computer, in, their, house, or, apartment, email, has, become, used, on, smartphones, and, on, all, types, of, computers, mobile, apps, for, email, increase, accessibility, to, the, medium, for, users, who, are, out, of, their, homes, while, in, the, earliest, years, of, email, users, could, only, access, email, on, desktop, computers, in, the, 2010s, it, is, possible, for, users, to, check, their, email, when, they, are, away, from, home, whether, they, are, across, town, or, across, the, world, alerts, can, also, be, sent, to, the, smartphone, or, other, devices, to, notify, them, immediately, of, new, messages, this, has, given, email, the, ability, to, be, used, for, more, frequent, communication, between, users, and, allowed, them, to, check, their, email, and, write, messages, throughout, the, day, as, of, 2011, there, were, approximately, 1, 4, billion, email, users, worldwide, and, 50, billion, non, spam, emails, that, were, sent, daily, individuals, often, check, emails, on, smartphones, for, both, personal, and, work, related, messages, it, was, found, that, us, adults, check, their, email, more, than, they, browse, the, web, or, check, their, facebook, accounts, making, email, the, most, popular, activity, for, users, to, do, on, their, smartphones, 78, of, the, respondents, in, the, study, revealed, that, they, check, their, email, on, their, phone, it, was, also, found, that, 30, of, consumers, use, only, their, smartphone, to, check, their, email, and, 91, were, likely, to, check, their, email, at, least, once, per, day, on, their, smartphone, however, the, percentage, of, consumers, using, email, on, a, smartphone, ranges, and, differs, dramatically, across, different, countries, for, example, in, comparison, to, 75, of, those, consumers, in, the, us, who, used, it, only, 17, in, india, did, as, of, 2010, the, number, of, americans, visiting, email, web, sites, had, fallen, 6, percent, after, peaking, in, november, 2009, for, persons, 12, to, 17, the, number, was, down, 18, percent, young, people, preferred, instant, messaging, texting, and, social, media, technology, writer, matt, richtel, said, in, the, new, york, times, that, email, was, like, the, vcr, vinyl, records, and, film, cameras, no, longer, cool, and, something, older, people, do, a, 2015, survey, of, android, users, showed, that, persons, 13, to, 24, used, messaging, apps, 3, 5, times, as, much, as, those, over, 45, and, were, far, less, likely, to, use, email, email, messages, may, have, one, or, more, attachments, which, are, additional, files, that, are, appended, to, the, email, typical, attachments, include, microsoft, word, documents, pdf, documents, and, scanned, images, of, paper, documents, in, principle, there, is, no, technical, restriction, on, the, size, or, number, of, attachments, however, in, practice, email, clients, servers, and, internet, service, providers, implement, various, limitations, on, the, size, of, files, or, complete, email, typically, to, 25mb, or, less, furthermore, due, to, technical, reasons, attachment, sizes, as, seen, by, these, transport, systems, can, differ, from, what, the, user, sees, which, can, be, confusing, to, senders, when, trying, to, assess, whether, they, can, safely, send, a, file, by, email, where, larger, files, need, to, be, shared, various, file, hosting, services, are, available, and, commonly, used, the, ubiquity, of, email, for, knowledge, workers, and, white, collar, employees, has, led, to, concerns, that, recipients, face, an, information, overload, in, dealing, with, increasing, volumes, of, email, with, the, growth, in, mobile, devices, by, default, employees, may, also, receive, work, related, emails, outside, of, their, working, day, this, can, lead, to, increased, stress, and, decreased, satisfaction, with, work, some, observers, even, argue, it, could, have, a, significant, negative, economic, effect, as, efforts, to, read, the, many, emails, could, reduce, productivity, email, spam, is, unsolicited, bulk, email, the, low, cost, of, sending, such, email, meant, that, by, 2003, up, to, 30, of, total, email, traffic, was, spam, and, was, threatening, the, usefulness, of, email, as, a, practical, tool, the, us, can, spam, act, of, 2003, and, similar, laws, elsewhere, had, some, impact, and, a, number, of, effective, anti, spam, techniques, now, largely, mitigate, the, impact, of, spam, by, filtering, or, rejecting, it, for, most, users, but, the, volume, sent, is, still, very, high, and, increasingly, consists, not, of, advertisements, for, products, but, malicious, content, or, links, in, september, 2017, for, example, the, proportion, of, spam, to, legitimate, email, rose, to, 59, 56, the, percentage, of, spam, email, in, 2021, is, estimated, to, be, 85, emails, are, a, major, vector, for, the, distribution, of, malware, this, is, often, achieved, by, attaching, malicious, programs, to, the, message, and, persuading, potential, victims, to, open, the, file, types, of, malware, distributed, via, email, include, computer, worms, and, ransomware, email, spoofing, occurs, when, the, email, message, header, is, designed, to, make, the, message, appear, to, come, from, a, known, or, trusted, source, email, spam, and, phishing, methods, typically, use, spoofing, to, mislead, the, recipient, about, the, true, message, origin, email, spoofing, may, be, done, as, a, prank, or, as, part, of, a, criminal, effort, to, defraud, an, individual, or, organization, an, example, of, a, potentially, fraudulent, email, spoofing, is, if, an, individual, creates, an, email, that, appears, to, be, an, invoice, from, a, major, company, and, then, sends, it, to, one, or, more, recipients, in, some, cases, these, fraudulent, emails, incorporate, the, logo, of, the, purported, organization, and, even, the, email, address, may, appear, legitimate, email, bombing, is, the, intentional, sending, of, large, volumes, of, messages, to, a, target, address, the, overloading, of, the, target, email, address, can, render, it, unusable, and, can, even, cause, the, mail, server, to, crash, today, it, can, be, important, to, distinguish, between, the, internet, and, internal, email, systems, internet, email, may, travel, and, be, stored, on, networks, and, computers, without, the, sender, s, or, the, recipient, s, control, during, the, transit, time, it, is, possible, that, third, parties, read, or, even, modify, the, content, internal, mail, systems, in, which, the, information, never, leaves, the, organizational, network, may, be, more, secure, although, information, technology, personnel, and, others, whose, function, may, involve, monitoring, or, managing, may, be, accessing, the, email, of, other, employees, email, privacy, without, some, security, precautions, can, be, compromised, because, there, are, cryptography, applications, that, can, serve, as, a, remedy, to, one, or, more, of, the, above, for, example, virtual, private, networks, or, the, tor, network, can, be, used, to, encrypt, traffic, from, the, user, machine, to, a, safer, network, while, gpg, pgp, smemail, or, s, mime, can, be, used, for, end, to, end, message, encryption, and, smtp, starttls, or, smtp, over, transport, layer, security, secure, sockets, layer, can, be, used, to, encrypt, communications, for, a, single, mail, hop, between, the, smtp, client, and, the, smtp, server, additionally, many, mail, user, agents, do, not, protect, logins, and, passwords, making, them, easy, to, intercept, by, an, attacker, encrypted, authentication, schemes, such, as, sasl, prevent, this, finally, the, attached, files, share, many, of, the, same, hazards, as, those, found, in, peer, to, peer, filesharing, attached, files, may, contain, trojans, or, viruses, it, is, possible, for, an, exchange, of, emails, to, form, a, binding, contract, so, users, must, be, careful, about, what, they, send, through, email, correspondence, a, signature, block, on, an, email, may, be, interpreted, as, satisfying, a, signature, requirement, for, a, contract, flaming, occurs, when, a, person, sends, a, message, or, many, messages, with, angry, or, antagonistic, content, the, term, is, derived, from, the, use, of, the, word, incendiary, to, describe, particularly, heated, email, discussions, the, ease, and, impersonality, of, email,
