soap, is, a, salt, of, a, fatty, acid, sometimes, other, carboxylic, acids, used, for, cleaning, and, lubricating, products, as, well, as, other, applications, in, a, domestic, setting, soaps, specifically, toilet, soaps, are, surfactants, usually, used, for, washing, bathing, and, other, types, of, housekeeping, in, industrial, settings, soaps, are, used, as, thickeners, components, of, some, lubricants, emulsifiers, and, catalysts, soaps, are, often, produced, by, mixing, fats, and, oils, with, a, base, humans, have, used, soap, for, millennia, evidence, exists, for, the, production, of, soap, like, materials, in, ancient, babylon, around, 2800, bc, in, a, domestic, setting, soap, usually, refers, to, what, is, technically, called, a, toilet, soap, used, for, household, and, personal, cleaning, toilet, soaps, are, salts, of, fatty, acids, with, the, general, formula, rco, 2, m, where, m, is, na, sodium, or, k, potassium, when, used, for, cleaning, soap, solubilizes, particles, and, grime, which, can, then, be, separated, from, the, article, being, cleaned, the, insoluble, oil, fat, dirt, become, associated, inside, micelles, tiny, spheres, formed, from, soap, molecules, with, polar, hydrophilic, water, attracting, groups, on, the, outside, and, encasing, a, lipophilic, fat, attracting, pocket, which, shields, the, oil, fat, molecules, from, the, water, making, them, soluble, anything, that, is, soluble, will, be, washed, away, with, the, water, in, hand, washing, as, a, surfactant, when, lathered, with, a, little, water, soap, kills, microorganisms, by, disorganizing, their, membrane, lipid, bilayer, and, denaturing, their, proteins, it, also, emulsifies, oils, enabling, them, to, be, carried, away, by, running, water, when, used, in, hard, water, soap, does, not, lather, well, but, forms, soap, scum, related, to, metallic, soaps, see, below, so, called, metallic, soaps, are, key, components, of, most, lubricating, greases, and, thickeners, a, commercially, important, example, is, lithium, stearate, greases, are, usually, emulsions, of, calcium, soap, or, lithium, soap, and, mineral, oil, many, other, metallic, soaps, are, also, useful, including, those, of, aluminium, sodium, and, mixtures, thereof, such, soaps, are, also, used, as, thickeners, to, increase, the, viscosity, of, oils, in, ancient, times, lubricating, greases, were, made, by, the, addition, of, lime, to, olive, oil, which, would, produce, calcium, soaps, metal, soaps, are, also, included, in, modern, artists, oil, paints, formulations, as, a, rheology, modifier, metal, soaps, can, be, prepared, by, neutralizing, fatty, acids, with, metal, oxides, a, cation, from, an, organic, base, such, as, ammonium, can, be, used, instead, of, a, metal, ammonium, nonanoate, is, an, ammonium, based, soap, that, is, used, as, an, herbicide, another, class, of, non, toilet, soaps, are, resin, soaps, which, are, produced, in, the, paper, industry, by, the, action, of, tree, rosin, with, alkaline, reagents, used, to, separate, cellulose, from, raw, wood, a, major, component, of, such, soaps, is, the, sodium, salt, of, abietic, acid, resin, soaps, are, used, as, emulsifiers, the, production, of, toilet, soaps, usually, entails, saponification, of, triglycerides, which, are, vegetable, or, animal, oils, and, fats, an, alkaline, solution, often, lye, or, sodium, hydroxide, induces, saponification, whereby, the, triglyceride, fats, first, hydrolyze, into, salts, of, fatty, acids, glycerol, glycerin, is, liberated, the, glycerin, is, sometimes, left, in, the, soap, product, as, a, softening, agent, although, it, is, sometimes, separated, handmade, soap, can, differ, from, industrially, made, soap, in, that, an, excess, of, fat, or, coconut, oil, cazumbal, process, is, used, beyond, that, needed, to, consume, the, alkali, in, a, cold, pour, process, this, excess, fat, is, called, superfatting, and, the, glycerol, left, in, acts, as, a, moisturizing, agent, however, the, glycerine, also, makes, the, soap, softer, the, addition, of, glycerol, and, processing, of, this, soap, produces, glycerin, soap, superfatted, soap, is, more, skin, friendly, than, one, without, extra, fat, although, it, can, leave, a, greasy, feel, sometimes, an, emollient, is, added, such, as, jojoba, oil, or, shea, butter, sand, or, pumice, may, be, added, to, produce, a, scouring, soap, the, scouring, agents, serve, to, remove, dead, cells, from, the, skin, surface, being, cleaned, this, process, is, called, exfoliation, to, make, antibacterial, soap, compounds, such, as, triclosan, or, triclocarban, can, be, added, there, is, some, concern, that, use, of, antibacterial, soaps, and, other, products, might, encourage, antimicrobial, resistance, in, microorganisms, the, type, of, alkali, metal, used, determines, the, kind, of, soap, product, sodium, soaps, prepared, from, sodium, hydroxide, are, firm, whereas, potassium, soaps, derived, from, potassium, hydroxide, are, softer, or, often, liquid, historically, potassium, hydroxide, was, extracted, from, the, ashes, of, bracken, or, other, plants, lithium, soaps, also, tend, to, be, hard, these, are, used, exclusively, in, greases, for, making, toilet, soaps, triglycerides, oils, and, fats, are, derived, from, coconut, olive, or, palm, oils, as, well, as, tallow, triglyceride, is, the, chemical, name, for, the, tri, esters, of, fatty, acids, and, glycerin, tallow, i, e, rendered, fat, is, the, most, available, triglyceride, from, animals, each, species, offers, quite, different, fatty, acid, content, resulting, in, soaps, of, distinct, feel, the, seed, oils, give, softer, but, milder, soaps, soap, made, from, pure, olive, oil, sometimes, called, castile, soap, or, marseille, soap, is, reputed, for, its, particular, mildness, the, term, castile, is, also, sometimes, applied, to, soaps, from, a, mixture, of, oils, with, a, high, percentage, of, olive, oil, it, is, uncertain, as, to, who, was, the, first, to, invent, soap, the, earliest, recorded, evidence, of, the, production, of, soap, like, materials, dates, back, to, around, 2800, bc, in, ancient, babylon, a, formula, for, making, soap, was, written, on, a, sumerian, clay, tablet, around, 2500, bc, the, soap, was, produced, by, heating, a, mixture, of, oil, and, wood, ash, the, earliest, recorded, chemical, reaction, and, used, for, washing, woolen, clothing, the, ebers, papyrus, egypt, 1550, bc, indicates, the, ancient, egyptians, used, soap, as, a, medicine, and, combined, animal, fats, or, vegetable, oils, with, a, soda, ash, substance, called, trona, to, create, their, soaps, egyptian, documents, mention, a, similar, substance, was, used, in, the, preparation, of, wool, for, weaving, in, the, reign, of, nabonidus, 556, 539, bc, a, recipe, for, soap, consisted, of, uhulu, cypress, and, sesame, for, washing, the, stones, for, the, servant, girls, in, the, southern, levant, the, ashes, from, barilla, plants, such, as, species, of, salsola, saltwort, seidlitzia, rosmarinus, and, anabasis, were, used, in, soap, production, known, as, potash, traditionally, olive, oil, was, used, instead, of, animal, lard, throughout, the, levant, which, was, boiled, in, a, copper, cauldron, for, several, days, as, the, boiling, progresses, alkali, ashes, and, smaller, quantities, of, quicklime, are, added, and, constantly, stirred, in, the, case, of, lard, it, required, constant, stirring, while, kept, lukewarm, until, it, began, to, trace, once, it, began, to, thicken, the, brew, was, poured, into, a, mold, and, left, to, cool, and, harden, for, two, weeks, after, hardening, it, was, cut, into, smaller, cakes, aromatic, herbs, were, often, added, to, the, rendered, soap, to, impart, their, fragrance, such, as, yarrow, leaves, lavender, germander, etc, pliny, the, elder, whose, writings, chronicle, life, in, the, first, century, ad, describes, soap, as, an, invention, of, the, gauls, the, word, sapo, latin, for, soap, likely, was, borrowed, from, an, early, germanic, language, and, is, cognate, with, latin, sebum, tallow, it, first, appears, in, pliny, the, elder, s, account, historia, naturalis, which, discusses, the, manufacture, of, soap, from, tallow, and, ashes, there, he, mentions, its, use, in, the, treatment, of, scrofulous, sores, as, well, as, among, the, gauls, as, a, dye, to, redden, hair, which, the, men, in, germania, were, more, likely, to, use, than, women, the, romans, avoided, washing, with, harsh, soaps, before, encountering, the, milder, soaps, used, by, the, gauls, around, 58, bc, aretaeus, of, cappadocia, writing, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, observes, among, celts, which, are, men, called, gauls, those, alkaline, substances, that, are, made, into, balls, called, soap, the, romans, preferred, method, of, cleaning, the, body, was, to, massage, oil, into, the, skin, and, then, scrape, away, both, the, oil, and, any, dirt, with, a, strigil, the, standard, design, is, a, curved, blade, with, a, handle, all, of, which, is, made, of, metal, the, 2nd, century, ad, physician, galen, describes, soap, making, using, lye, and, prescribes, washing, to, carry, away, impurities, from, the, body, and, clothes, the, use, of, soap, for, personal, cleanliness, became, increasingly, common, in, this, period, according, to, galen, the, best, soaps, were, germanic, and, soaps, from, gaul, were, second, best, zosimos, of, panopolis, circa, 300, ad, describes, soap, and, soapmaking, a, detergent, similar, to, soap, was, manufactured, in, ancient, china, from, the, seeds, of, gleditsia, sinensis, another, traditional, detergent, is, a, mixture, of, pig, pancreas, and, plant, ash, called, zhuyizi, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, zh, y, z, soap, made, of, animal, fat, did, not, appear, in, china, until, the, modern, era, soap, like, detergents, were, not, as, popular, as, ointments, and, creams, hard, toilet, soap, with, a, pleasant, smell, was, produced, in, the, middle, east, during, the, islamic, golden, age, when, soap, making, became, an, established, industry, recipes, for, soap, making, are, described, by, muhammad, ibn, zakariya, al, razi, c, 865, 925, who, also, gave, a, recipe, for, producing, glycerine, from, olive, oil, in, the, middle, east, soap, was, produced, from, the, interaction, of, fatty, oils, and, fats, with, alkali, in, syria, soap, was, produced, using, olive, oil, together, with, alkali, and, lime, soap, was, exported, from, syria, to, other, parts, of, the, muslim, world, and, to, europe, a, 12th, century, document, describes, the, process, of, soap, production, it, mentions, the, key, ingredient, alkali, which, later, became, crucial, to, modern, chemistry, derived, from, al, qaly, or, ashes, by, the, 13th, century, the, manufacture, of, soap, in, the, middle, east, had, become, a, major, cottage, industry, with, sources, in, nablus, fes, damascus, and, aleppo, soapmakers, in, naples, were, members, of, a, guild, in, the, late, sixth, century, then, under, the, control, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, in, the, eighth, century, soap, making, was, well, known, in, italy, and, spain, the, carolingian, capitulary, de, villis, dating, to, around, 800, representing, the, royal, will, of, charlemagne, mentions, soap, as, being, one, of, the, products, the, stewards, of, royal, estates, are, to, tally, the, lands, of, medieval, spain, were, a, leading, soapmaker, by, 800, and, soapmaking, began, in, the, kingdom, of, england, about, 1200, soapmaking, is, mentioned, both, as, women, s, work, and, as, the, produce, of, good, workmen, alongside, other, necessities, such, as, the, produce, of, carpenters, blacksmiths, and, bakers, in, europe, soap, in, the, 9th, century, was, produced, from, animal, fats, and, had, an, unpleasant, smell, this, changed, when, olive, oil, began, to, be, used, in, soap, formulas, instead, after, which, much, of, europe, s, soap, production, moved, to, the, mediterranean, olive, growing, regions, hard, toilet, soap, was, introduced, to, europe, by, arabs, and, gradually, spread, as, a, luxury, item, it, was, often, perfumed, by, the, 15th, century, the, manufacture, of, soap, in, the, christendom, had, become, virtually, industrialized, with, sources, in, antwerp, castile, marseille, naples, and, venice, in, france, by, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, the, semi, industrialized, professional, manufacture, of, soap, was, concentrated, in, a, few, centers, of, provence, toulon, hy, res, and, marseille, which, supplied, the, rest, of, france, in, marseilles, by, 1525, production, was, concentrated, in, at, least, two, factories, and, soap, production, at, marseille, tended, to, eclipse, the, other, proven, al, centers, english, manufacture, tended, to, concentrate, in, london, finer, soaps, were, later, produced, in, europe, from, the, 17th, century, using, vegetable, oils, such, as, olive, oil, as, opposed, to, animal, fats, many, of, these, soaps, are, still, produced, both, industrially, and, by, small, scale, artisans, castile, soap, is, a, popular, example, of, the, vegetable, only, soaps, derived, from, the, oldest, white, soap, of, italy, in, 1634, charles, i, granted, the, newly, formed, society, of, soapmakers, a, monopoly, in, soap, production, who, produced, certificates, from, foure, countesses, and, five, viscountesses, and, divers, other, ladies, and, gentlewomen, of, great, credite, and, quality, besides, common, laundresses, and, others, testifying, that, the, new, white, soap, washeth, whiter, and, sweeter, than, the, old, soap, during, the, restoration, era, february, 1665, august, 1714, a, soap, tax, was, introduced, in, england, which, meant, that, until, the, mid, 1800s, soap, was, a, luxury, used, regularly, only, by, the, well, to, do, the, soap, manufacturing, process, was, closely, supervised, by, revenue, officials, who, made, sure, that, soapmakers, equipment, was, kept, under, lock, and, key, when, not, being, supervised, moreover, soap, could, not, be, produced, by, small, makers, because, of, a, law, that, stipulated, that, soap, boilers, must, manufacture, a, minimum, quantity, of, one, imperial, ton, at, each, boiling, which, placed, the, process, beyond, the, reach, of, the, average, person, the, soap, trade, was, boosted, and, deregulated, when, the, tax, was, repealed, in, 1853, industrially, manufactured, bar, soaps, became, available, in, the, late, 18th, century, as, advertising, campaigns, in, europe, and, america, promoted, popular, awareness, of, the, relationship, between, cleanliness, and, health, in, modern, times, the, use, of, soap, has, become, commonplace, in, industrialized, nations, due, to, a, better, understanding, of, the, role, of, hygiene, in, reducing, the, population, size, of, pathogenic, microorganisms, until, the, industrial, revolution, soapmaking, was, conducted, on, a, small, scale, and, the, product, was, rough, in, 1780, james, keir, established, a, chemical, works, at, tipton, for, the, manufacture, of, alkali, from, the, sulfates, of, potash, and, soda, to, which, he, afterwards, added, a, soap, manufactory, the, method, of, extraction, proceeded, on, a, discovery, of, keir, s, in, 1790, nicolas, leblanc, discovered, how, to, make, alkali, from, common, salt, andrew, pears, started, making, a, high, quality, transparent, soap, pears, soap, in, 1807, in, london, his, son, in, law, thomas, j, barratt, became, the, brand, manager, the, first, of, its, kind, for, pears, in, 1865, in, 1882, barratt, recruited, english, actress, and, socialite, lillie, langtry, to, become, the, poster, girl, for, pears, soap, making, her, the, first, celebrity, to, endorse, a, commercial, product, william, gossage, produced, low, priced, good, quality, soap, from, the, 1850s, robert, spear, hudson, began, manufacturing, a, soap, powder, in, 1837, initially, by, grinding, the, soap, with, a, mortar, and, pestle, american, manufacturer, benjamin, t, babbitt, introduced, marketing, innovations, that, included, the, sale, of, bar, soap, and, distribution, of, product, samples, william, hesketh, lever, and, his, brother, james, bought, a, small, soap, works, in, warrington, in, 1886, and, founded, what, is, still, one, of, the, largest, soap, businesses, formerly, called, lever, brothers, and, now, called, unilever, these, soap, businesses, were, among, the, first, to, employ, large, scale, advertising, campaigns, liquid, soap, was, invented, in, the, nineteenth, century, in, 1865, william, sheppard, patented, a, liquid, version, of, soap, in, 1898, b, j, johnson, developed, a, soap, derived, from, palm, and, olive, oils, his, company, the, b, j, johnson, soap, company, introduced, palmolive, brand, soap, that, same, year, this, new, brand, of, soap, became, popular, rapidly, and, to, such, a, degree, that, b, j, johnson, soap, company, changed, its, name, to, palmolive, in, the, early, 1900s, other, companies, began, to, develop, their, own, liquid, soaps, such, products, as, pine, sol, and, tide, appeared, on, the, market, making, the, process, of, cleaning, things, other, than, skin, such, as, clothing, floors, and, bathrooms, much, easier, liquid, soap, also, works, better, for, more, traditional, or, non, machine, washing, methods, such, as, using, a, washboard
