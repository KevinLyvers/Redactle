animal, husbandry, is, the, branch, of, agriculture, concerned, with, animals, that, are, raised, for, meat, fibre, milk, or, other, products, it, includes, day, to, day, care, management, production, nutrition, selective, breeding, and, the, raising, of, livestock, husbandry, has, a, long, history, starting, with, the, neolithic, revolution, when, animals, were, first, domesticated, from, around, 13, 000, bc, onwards, predating, farming, of, the, first, crops, by, the, time, of, early, civilisations, such, as, ancient, egypt, cattle, sheep, goats, and, pigs, were, being, raised, on, farms, major, changes, took, place, in, the, columbian, exchange, when, old, world, livestock, were, brought, to, the, new, world, and, then, in, the, british, agricultural, revolution, of, the, 18th, century, when, livestock, breeds, like, the, dishley, longhorn, cattle, and, lincoln, longwool, sheep, were, rapidly, improved, by, agriculturalists, such, as, robert, bakewell, to, yield, more, meat, milk, and, wool, a, wide, range, of, other, species, such, as, horse, water, buffalo, llama, rabbit, and, guinea, pig, are, used, as, livestock, in, some, parts, of, the, world, insect, farming, as, well, as, aquaculture, of, fish, molluscs, and, crustaceans, is, widespread, modern, animal, husbandry, relies, on, production, systems, adapted, to, the, type, of, land, available, subsistence, farming, is, being, superseded, by, intensive, animal, farming, in, the, more, developed, parts, of, the, world, where, for, example, beef, cattle, are, kept, in, high, density, feedlots, and, thousands, of, chickens, may, be, raised, in, broiler, houses, or, batteries, on, poorer, soil, such, as, in, uplands, animals, are, often, kept, more, extensively, and, may, be, allowed, to, roam, widely, foraging, for, themselves, animal, agriculture, at, modern, scale, drives, climate, change, ocean, acidification, and, biodiversity, loss, most, livestock, are, herbivores, except, for, pigs, and, chickens, which, are, omnivores, ruminants, like, cattle, and, sheep, are, adapted, to, feed, on, grass, they, can, forage, outdoors, or, may, be, fed, entirely, or, in, part, on, rations, richer, in, energy, and, protein, such, as, pelleted, cereals, pigs, and, poultry, cannot, digest, the, cellulose, in, forage, and, require, other, high, protein, foods, the, verb, to, husband, meaning, to, manage, carefully, derives, from, an, older, meaning, of, husband, which, in, the, 14th, century, referred, to, the, ownership, and, care, of, a, household, or, farm, but, today, means, the, control, or, judicious, use, of, resources, and, in, agriculture, the, cultivation, of, plants, or, animals, farmers, and, ranchers, who, raise, livestock, are, considered, to, practice, animal, husbandry, the, domestication, of, livestock, was, driven, by, the, need, to, have, food, on, hand, when, hunting, was, unproductive, the, desirable, characteristics, of, a, domestic, animal, are, that, it, should, be, useful, to, the, domesticator, should, be, able, to, thrive, in, his, or, her, company, should, breed, freely, and, be, easy, to, tend, domestication, was, not, a, single, event, but, a, process, repeated, at, various, periods, in, different, places, sheep, and, goats, were, the, animals, that, accompanied, the, nomads, in, the, middle, east, while, cattle, and, pigs, were, associated, with, more, settled, communities, the, first, wild, animal, to, be, domesticated, was, the, dog, half, wild, dogs, perhaps, starting, with, young, individuals, may, have, been, tolerated, as, scavengers, and, killers, of, vermin, and, being, naturally, pack, hunters, were, predisposed, to, become, part, of, the, human, pack, and, join, in, the, hunt, prey, animals, sheep, goats, pigs, and, cattle, were, progressively, domesticated, early, in, the, history, of, agriculture, pigs, were, domesticated, in, the, near, east, between, 8, 500, and, 8000, bc, sheep, and, goats, in, or, near, the, fertile, crescent, about, 8, 500, bc, and, cattle, from, wild, aurochs, in, the, areas, of, modern, turkey, and, pakistan, around, 8, 500, bc, a, cow, was, a, great, advantage, to, a, villager, as, she, produced, more, milk, than, her, calf, needed, and, her, strength, could, be, put, to, use, as, a, working, animal, pulling, a, plough, to, increase, production, of, crops, and, drawing, a, sledge, and, later, a, cart, to, bring, the, produce, home, from, the, field, draught, animals, were, first, used, about, 4, 000, bc, in, the, middle, east, increasing, agricultural, production, immeasurably, in, southern, asia, the, elephant, was, domesticated, by, 6, 000, bc, fossilised, chicken, bones, dated, to, 5040, bc, have, been, found, in, northeastern, china, far, from, where, their, wild, ancestors, lived, in, the, jungles, of, tropical, asia, but, archaeologists, believe, that, the, original, purpose, of, domestication, was, for, the, sport, of, cockfighting, meanwhile, in, south, america, the, llama, and, the, alpaca, had, been, domesticated, probably, before, 3, 000, bc, as, beasts, of, burden, and, for, their, wool, neither, was, strong, enough, to, pull, a, plough, which, limited, the, development, of, agriculture, in, the, new, world, horses, occur, naturally, on, the, steppes, of, central, asia, and, their, domestication, began, around, 3, 000, bc, in, the, black, sea, and, caspian, sea, region, although, horses, were, originally, seen, as, a, source, of, meat, their, use, as, pack, animals, and, for, riding, followed, around, the, same, time, the, wild, ass, was, being, tamed, in, egypt, camels, were, domesticated, soon, after, this, with, the, bactrian, camel, in, mongolia, and, the, arabian, camel, becoming, beasts, of, burden, by, 1000, bc, caravans, of, arabian, camels, were, linking, india, with, mesopotamia, and, the, mediterranean, in, ancient, egypt, cattle, were, the, most, important, livestock, and, sheep, goats, and, pigs, were, also, kept, poultry, including, ducks, geese, and, pigeons, were, captured, in, nets, and, bred, on, farms, where, they, were, force, fed, with, dough, to, fatten, them, the, nile, provided, a, plentiful, source, of, fish, honey, bees, were, domesticated, from, at, least, the, old, kingdom, providing, both, honey, and, wax, in, ancient, rome, all, the, livestock, known, in, ancient, egypt, were, available, in, addition, rabbits, were, domesticated, for, food, by, the, first, century, bc, to, help, flush, them, out, from, their, burrows, the, polecat, was, domesticated, as, the, ferret, its, use, described, by, pliny, the, elder, in, northern, europe, agriculture, including, animal, husbandry, went, into, decline, when, the, roman, empire, collapsed, some, aspects, such, as, the, herding, of, animals, continued, throughout, the, period, by, the, 11th, century, the, economy, had, recovered, and, the, countryside, was, again, productive, the, domesday, book, recorded, every, parcel, of, land, and, every, animal, in, england, there, was, not, one, single, hide, nor, a, yard, of, land, nay, moreover, not, even, an, ox, nor, a, cow, nor, a, swine, was, there, left, that, was, not, set, down, in, writ, for, example, the, royal, manor, of, earley, in, berkshire, one, of, thousands, of, villages, recorded, in, the, book, had, in, 1086, 2, fisheries, worth, 7s, and, 6d, and, 20, acres, of, meadow, woodland, for, 70, pigs, the, improvements, of, animal, husbandry, in, the, medieval, period, in, europe, went, hand, in, hand, with, other, developments, improvements, to, the, plough, allowed, the, soil, to, be, tilled, to, a, greater, depth, horses, took, over, from, oxen, as, the, main, providers, of, traction, new, ideas, on, crop, rotation, were, developed, and, the, growing, of, crops, for, winter, fodder, gained, ground, peas, beans, and, vetches, became, common, they, increased, soil, fertility, through, nitrogen, fixation, allowing, more, livestock, to, be, kept, exploration, and, colonisation, of, north, and, south, america, resulted, in, the, introduction, into, europe, of, such, crops, as, maize, potatoes, sweet, potatoes, and, manioc, while, the, principal, old, world, livestock, cattle, horses, sheep, and, goats, were, introduced, into, the, new, world, for, the, first, time, along, with, wheat, barley, rice, and, turnips, selective, breeding, for, desired, traits, was, established, as, a, scientific, practice, by, robert, bakewell, during, the, british, agricultural, revolution, in, the, 18th, century, one, of, his, most, important, breeding, programs, was, with, sheep, using, native, stock, he, was, able, to, quickly, select, for, large, yet, fine, boned, sheep, with, long, lustrous, wool, the, lincoln, longwool, was, improved, by, bakewell, and, in, turn, the, lincoln, was, used, to, develop, the, subsequent, breed, named, the, new, or, dishley, leicester, it, was, hornless, and, had, a, square, meaty, body, with, straight, top, lines, these, sheep, were, exported, widely, and, have, contributed, to, numerous, modern, breeds, under, his, influence, english, farmers, began, to, breed, cattle, for, use, primarily, as, beef, long, horned, heifers, were, crossed, with, the, westmoreland, bull, to, create, the, dishley, longhorn, the, semi, natural, unfertilised, pastures, formed, by, traditional, agricultural, methods, in, europe, were, managed, by, grazing, and, mowing, as, the, ecological, impact, of, this, land, management, strategy, is, similar, to, the, impact, of, such, natural, disturbances, as, a, wildfire, this, agricultural, system, shares, many, beneficial, characteristics, with, a, natural, habitat, including, the, promotion, of, biodiversity, this, strategy, is, declining, in, europe, today, due, to, the, intensification, of, agriculture, the, mechanized, and, chemical, methods, used, are, causing, biodiversity, to, decline, traditionally, animal, husbandry, was, part, of, the, subsistence, farmer, s, way, of, life, producing, not, only, the, food, needed, by, the, family, but, also, the, fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport, and, draught, power, killing, the, animal, for, food, was, a, secondary, consideration, and, wherever, possible, its, products, such, as, wool, eggs, milk, and, blood, by, the, maasai, were, harvested, while, the, animal, was, still, alive, in, the, traditional, system, of, transhumance, people, and, livestock, moved, seasonally, between, fixed, summer, and, winter, pastures, in, montane, regions, the, summer, pasture, was, up, in, the, mountains, the, winter, pasture, in, the, valleys, animals, can, be, kept, extensively, or, intensively, extensive, systems, involve, animals, roaming, at, will, or, under, the, supervision, of, a, herdsman, often, for, their, protection, from, predators, ranching, in, the, western, united, states, involves, large, herds, of, cattle, grazing, widely, over, public, and, private, lands, similar, cattle, stations, are, found, in, south, america, australia, and, other, places, with, large, areas, of, land, and, low, rainfall, ranching, systems, have, been, used, for, sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama, and, alpaca, in, the, uplands, of, the, united, kingdom, sheep, are, turned, out, on, the, fells, in, spring, and, graze, the, abundant, mountain, grasses, untended, being, brought, to, lower, altitudes, late, in, the, year, with, supplementary, feeding, being, provided, in, winter, in, rural, locations, pigs, and, poultry, can, obtain, much, of, their, nutrition, from, scavenging, and, in, african, communities, hens, may, live, for, months, without, being, fed, and, still, produce, one, or, two, eggs, a, week, at, the, other, extreme, in, the, more, developed, parts, of, the, world, animals, are, often, intensively, managed, dairy, cows, may, be, kept, in, zero, grazing, conditions, with, all, their, forage, brought, to, them, beef, cattle, may, be, kept, in, high, density, feedlots, pigs, may, be, housed, in, climate, controlled, buildings, and, never, go, outdoors, poultry, may, be, reared, in, barns, and, kept, in, cages, as, laying, birds, under, lighting, controlled, conditions, in, between, these, two, extremes, are, semi, intensive, often, family, run, farms, where, livestock, graze, outside, for, much, of, the, year, silage, or, hay, is, made, to, cover, the, times, of, year, when, the, grass, stops, growing, and, fertiliser, feed, and, other, inputs, are, brought, onto, the, farm, from, outside, animals, used, as, livestock, are, predominantly, herbivorous, the, main, exceptions, being, the, pig, and, the, chicken, which, are, omnivorous, the, herbivores, can, be, divided, into, concentrate, selectors, which, selectively, feed, on, seeds, fruits, and, highly, nutritious, young, foliage, grazers, which, mainly, feed, on, grass, and, intermediate, feeders, which, choose, their, diet, from, the, whole, range, of, available, plant, material, cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and, antelopes, are, ruminants, they, digest, food, in, two, steps, chewing, and, swallowing, in, the, normal, way, and, then, regurgitating, the, semidigested, cud, to, chew, it, again, and, thus, extract, the, maximum, possible, food, value, the, dietary, needs, of, these, animals, is, mostly, met, by, eating, grass, grasses, grow, from, the, base, of, the, leaf, blade, enabling, it, to, thrive, even, when, heavily, grazed, or, cut, in, many, climates, grass, growth, is, seasonal, for, example, in, the, temperate, summer, or, tropical, rainy, season, so, some, areas, of, the, crop, are, set, aside, to, be, cut, and, preserved, either, as, hay, dried, grass, or, as, silage, fermented, grass, other, forage, crops, are, also, grown, and, many, of, these, as, well, as, crop, residues, can, be, ensiled, to, fill, the, gap, in, the, nutritional, needs, of, livestock, in, the, lean, season, extensively, reared, animals, may, subsist, entirely, on, forage, but, more, intensively, kept, livestock, will, require, energy, and, protein, rich, foods, in, addition, energy, is, mainly, derived, from, cereals, and, cereal, by, products, fats, and, oils, and, sugar, rich, foods, while, protein, may, come, from, fish, or, meat, meal, milk, products, legumes, and, other, plant, foods, often, the, by, products, of, vegetable, oil, extraction, pigs, and, poultry, are, non, ruminants, and, unable, to, digest, the, cellulose, in, grass, and, other, forages, so, they, are, fed, entirely, on, cereals, and, other, high, energy, foodstuffs, the, ingredients, for, the, animals, rations, can, be, grown, on, the, farm, or, can, be, bought, in, the, form, of, pelleted, or, cubed, compound, foodstuffs, specially, formulated, for, the, different, classes, of, livestock, their, growth, stages, and, their, specific, nutritional, requirements, vitamins, and, minerals, are, added, to, balance, the, diet, farmed, fish, are, usually, fed, pelleted, food, the, breeding, of, farm, animals, seldom, occurs, spontaneously, but, is, managed, by, farmers, with, a, view, to, encouraging, traits, seen, as, desirable, these, include, hardiness, fertility, docility, mothering, abilities, fast, growth, rates, low, feed, consumption, per, unit, of, growth, better, body, proportions, higher, yields, and, better, fibre, qualities, undesirable, traits, such, as, health, defects, and, aggressiveness, are, selected, against, selective, breeding, has, been, responsible, for, large, increases, in, productivity, for, example, in, 2007, a, typical, broiler, chicken, at, eight, weeks, old, was, 4, 8, times, as, heavy, as, a, bird, of, similar, age, in, 1957, while, in, the, thirty, years, to, 2007, the, average, milk, yield, of, a, dairy, cow, in, the, united, states, nearly, doubled, good, husbandry, proper, feeding, and, hygiene, are, the, main, contributors, to, animal, health, on, the, farm, bringing, economic, benefits, through, maximised, production, when, despite, these, precautions, animals, still, become, sick, they, are, treated, with, veterinary, medicines, by, the, farmer, and, the, veterinarian, in, the, european, union, when, farmers, treat, their, own, animals, they, are, required, to, follow, the, guidelines, for, treatment, and, to, record, the, treatments, given, animals, are, susceptible, to, a, number, of, diseases, and, conditions, that, may, affect, their, health, some, like, classical, swine, fever, and, scrapie, are, specific, to, one, type, of, stock, while, others, like, foot, and, mouth, disease, affect, all, cloven, hoofed, animals, animals, living, under, intensive, conditions, are, prone, to, internal, and, external, parasites, increasing, numbers, of, sea, lice, are, affecting, farmed, salmon, in, scotland, reducing, the, parasite, burdens, of, livestock, results, in, increased, productivity, and, profitability, where, the, condition, is, serious, governments, impose, regulations, on, import, and, export, on, the, movement, of, stock, quarantine, restrictions, and, the, reporting, of, suspected, cases, vaccines, are, available, against, certain, diseases, and, antibiotics, are, widely, used, where, appropriate, at, one, time, antibiotics, were, routinely, added, to, certain, compound, foodstuffs, to, promote, growth, but, this, practice, is, now, frowned, on, in, many, countries, because, of, the, risk, that, it, may, lead, to, antimicrobial, resistance, in, livestock, and, in, humans, governments, are, concerned, with, zoonoses, diseases, that, humans, may, acquire, from, animals, wild, animal, populations, may, harbour, diseases, that, can, affect, domestic, animals, which, may, acquire, them, as, a, result, of, insufficient, biosecurity, an, outbreak, of, nipah, virus, in, malaysia, in, 1999, was, traced, back, to, pigs, becoming, ill, after, contact, with, fruit, eating, flying, foxes, their, faeces, and, urine, the, pigs, in, turn, passed, the, infection, to, humans, avian, flu, h5n1, is, present, in, wild, bird, populations, and, can, be, carried, large, distances, by, migrating, birds, this, virus, is, easily, transmissible, to, domestic, poultry, and, to, humans, living, in, close, proximity, with, them, other, infectious, diseases, affecting, wild, animals, farm, animals, and, humans, include, rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis, and, trichinosis, there, is, no, single, universally, agreed, definition, of, which, species, are, livestock, widely, agreed, types, of, livestock, include, cattle, for, beef, and, dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and, poultry, various, other, species, are, sometimes, considered, livestock, such, as, horses, while, poultry, birds, are, sometimes, excluded, in, some, parts, of, the, world, livestock, includes, species, such, as, buffalo, and, the, south, american, camelids, the, alpaca, and, llama, some, authorities, use, much, broader, definitions, to, include, fish, in, aquaculture, micro, livestock, such, as, rabbits, and, rodents, like, guinea, pigs, as, well, as, insects, from, honey, bees, to, crickets, raised, for, human, consumption, animals, are, raised, for, a, wide, variety, of, products, principally, meat, wool, milk, and, eggs, but, also, including, tallow, isinglass, and, rennet, animals, are, also, kept, for, more, specialised, purposes, such, as, to, produce, vaccines, and, antiserum, containing, antibodies, for, medical, use, where, fodder, or, other, crops, are, grown, alongside, animals, manure, can, serve, as, a, fertiliser, returning, minerals, and, organic, matter, to, the, soil, in, a, semi, closed, organic, system, although, all, mammals, produce, milk, to, nourish, their, young, the, cow, is, predominantly, used, throughout, the, world, to, produce, milk, and, milk, products, for, human, consumption, other, animals, used, to, a, lesser, extent, for, this, purpose, include, sheep, goats, camels, buffaloes, yaks, reindeer, horses, and, donkeys, all, these, animals, have, been, domesticated, over, the, centuries, being, bred, for, such, desirable, characteristics, as, fecundity, productivity, docility, and, the, ability, to, thrive, under, the, prevailing, conditions, whereas, in, the, past, cattle, had, multiple, functions, modern, dairy, cow, breeding, has, resulted, in, specialised, holstein, friesian, type, animals, that, produce, large, quantities, of, milk, economically, artificial, insemination, is, widely, available, to, allow, farmers, to, select, for, the, particular, traits, that, suit, their, circumstances, whereas, in, the, past, cows, were, kept, in, small, herds, on, family, farms, grazing, pastures, and, being, fed, hay, in, winter, nowadays, there, is, a, trend, towards, larger, herds, more, intensive, systems, the, feeding, of, silage, and, zero, grazing, a, system, where, grass, is, cut, and, brought, to, the, cow, which, is, housed, year, round, in, many, communities, milk, production, is, only, part, of, the, purpose, of, keeping, an, animal, which, may, also, be, used, as, a, beast, of, burden, or, to, draw, a, plough, or, for, the, production, of, fibre, meat, and, leather, with, the, dung, being, used, for, fuel, or, for, the, improvement, of, soil, fertility, sheep, and, goats, may, be, favoured, for, dairy, production, in, climates, and, conditions, that, do, not, suit, dairy, cows, meat, mainly, from, farmed, animals, is, a, major, source, of, dietary, protein, and, essential, nutrients, around, the, world, averaging, about, 8, of, man, s, energy, intake, the, actual, types, eaten, depend, on, local, preferences, availability, cost, and, other, factors, with, cattle, sheep, pigs, and, goats, being, the, main, species, involved, cattle, generally, produce, a, single, offspring, annually, which, takes, more, than, a, year, to, mature, sheep, and, goats, often, have, twins, and, these, are, ready, for, slaughter, in, less, than, a, year, pigs, are, more, prolific, producing, more, than, one, litter, of, up, to, about, 11, piglets, each, year, horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos, and, vicunas, are, farmed, for, meat, in, various, regions, some, desirable, traits, of, animals, raised, for, meat, include, fecundity, hardiness, fast, growth, rate, ease, of, management, and, high, food, conversion, efficiency, about, half, of, the, world, s, meat, is, produced, from, animals, grazing, on, open, ranges, or, on, enclosed, pastures, the, other, half, being, produced, intensively, in, various, factory, farming, systems, these, are, mostly, cows, pigs, or, poultry, and, often, reared, indoors, typically, at, high, densities, poultry, kept, for, their, eggs, and, for, their, meat, include, chickens, turkeys, geese, and, ducks, the, great, majority, of, laying, birds, used, for, egg, production, are, chickens, methods, for, keeping, layers, range, from, free, range, systems, where, the, birds, can, roam, as, they, will, but, are, housed, at, night, for, their, own, protection, through, semi, intensive, systems, where, they, are, housed, in, barns, and, have, perches, litter, and, some, freedom, of, movement, to, intensive, systems, where, they, are, kept, in, cages, the, battery, cages, are, arranged, in, long, rows, in, multiple, tiers, with, external, feeders, drinkers, and, egg, collection, facilities, this, is, the, most, labour, saving, and, economical, method, of, egg, production, but, has, been, criticised, on, animal, welfare, grounds, as, the, birds, are, unable, to, exhibit, their, normal, behaviours, in, the, developed, world, the, majority, of, the, poultry, reared, for, meat, is, raised, indoors, in, big, sheds, with, automated, equipment, under, environmentally, controlled, conditions, chickens, raised, in, this, way, are, known, as, broilers, and, genetic, improvements, have, meant, that, they, can, be, grown, to, slaughter, weight, within, six, or, seven, weeks, of, hatching, newly, hatched, chicks, are, restricted, to, a, small, area, and, given, supplementary, heating, litter, on, the, floor, absorbs, the, droppings, and, the, area, occupied, is, expanded, as, they, grow, feed, and, water, is, supplied, automatically, and, the, lighting, is, controlled, the, birds, may, be, harvested, on, several, occasions, or, the, whole, shed, may, be, cleared, at, one, time, a, similar, rearing, system, is, usually, used, for, turkeys, which, are, less, hardy, than, chickens, but, they, take, longer, to, grow, and, are, often, moved, on, to, separate, fattening, units, to, finish, ducks, are, particularly, popular, in, asia, and, australia, and, can, be, killed, at, seven, weeks, under, commercial, conditions, aquaculture, has, been, defined, as, the, farming, of, aquatic, organisms, including, fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and, aquatic, plants, and, implies, some, form, of, intervention, in, the, rearing, process, to, enhance, production, such, as, regular, stocking, feeding, protection, from, predators, etc, farming, also, implies, individual, or, corporate, ownership, of, the, stock, being, cultivated, in, practice, it, can, take, place, in, the, sea, or, in, freshwater, and, be, extensive, or, intensive, whole, bays, lakes, or, ponds, may, be, devoted, to, aquaculture, or, the, farmed, animal, may, be, retained, in, cages, fish, artificial, reefs, racks, or, strings, shellfish, fish, and, prawns, can, be, cultivated, in, rice, paddies, either, arriving, naturally, or, being, introduced, and, both, crops, can, be, harvested, together, fish, hatcheries, provide, larval, and, juvenile, fish, crustaceans, and, shellfish, for, use, in, aquaculture, systems, when, large, enough, these, are, transferred, to, growing, on, tanks, and, sold, to, fish, farms, to, reach, harvest, size, some, species, that, are, commonly, raised, in, hatcheries, include, shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters, and, scallops, similar, facilities, can, be, used, to, raise, species, with, conservation, needs, to, be, released, into, the, wild, or, game, fish, for, restocking, waterways, important, aspects, of, husbandry, at, these, early, stages, include, selection, of, breeding, stock, control, of, water, quality, and, nutrition, in, the, wild, there, is, a, massive, amount, of, mortality, at, the, nursery, stage, farmers, seek, to, minimise, this, while, at, the, same, time, maximising, growth, rates, bees, have, been, kept, in, hives, since, at, least, the, first, dynasty, of, egypt, five, thousand, years, ago, and, man, had, been, harvesting, honey, from, the, wild, long, before, that, fixed, comb, hives, are, used, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, are, made, from, any, locally, available, material, in, more, advanced, economies, where, modern, strains, of, domestic, bee, have, been, selected, for, docility, and, productiveness, various, designs, of, hive, are, used, which, enable, the, combs, to, be, removed, for, processing, and, extraction, of, honey, quite, apart, from, the, honey, and, wax, they, produce, honey, bees, are, important, pollinators, of, crops, and, wild, plants, and, in, many, places, hives, are, transported, around, the, countryside, to, assist, in, pollination, sericulture, the, rearing, of, silkworms, was, first, adopted, by, the, chinese, during, the, shang, dynasty, the, only, species, farmed, commercially, is, the, domesticated, silkmoth, when, it, spins, its, cocoon, each, larva, produces, an, exceedingly, long, slender, thread, of, silk, the, larvae, feed, on, mulberry, leaves, and, in, europe, only, one, generation, is, normally, raised, each, year, as, this, is, a, deciduous, tree, in, china, korea, and, japan, however, two, generations, are, normal, and, in, the, tropics, multiple, generations, are, expected, most, production, of, silk, occurs, in, the, far, east, with, a, synthetic, diet, being, used, to, rear, the, silkworms, in, japan, insects, form, part, of, the, human, diet, in, many, cultures, in, thailand, crickets, are, farmed, for, this, purpose, in, the, north, of, the, country, and, palm, weevil, larvae, in, the, south, the, crickets, are, kept, in, pens, boxes, or, drawers, and, fed, on, commercial, pelleted, poultry, food, while, the, palm, weevil, larvae, live, on, cabbage, palm, and, sago, palm, trees, which, limits, their, production, to, areas, where, these, trees, grow, another, delicacy, of, this, region, is, the, bamboo, caterpillar, and, the, best, rearing, and, harvesting, techniques, in, semi, natural, habitats, are, being, studied, animal, husbandry, has, a, significant, impact, on, the, world, environment, both, production, and, consumption, of, animal, products, have, increased, rapidly, since, 1950, meat, production, has, tripled, whereas, the, production, of, dairy, products, doubled, and, that, of, eggs, almost, increased, fourfold, meanwhile, meat, consumption, has, nearly, doubled, worldwide, developing, countries, had, a, surge, in, meat, consumption, particularly, of, monogastric, livestock, animal,

production, is, responsible, for, 65, of, all, human, related, emissions, of, nitrous, oxide, since, the, 18th, century, people, have, become, increasingly, concerned, about, the, welfare, of, farm, animals, possible, measures, of, welfare, include, longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom, from, disease, and, freedom, from, immunosuppression, standards, and, laws, for, animal, welfare, have, been, created, worldwide, broadly, in, line, with, the, most, widely, held, position, in, the, western, world, a, form, of, utilitarianism, that, it, is, morally, acceptable, for, humans, to, use, non, human, animals, provided, that, no, unnecessary, suffering, is, caused, and, that, the, benefits, to, humans, outweigh, the, costs, to, the, livestock, an, opposing, view, is, that, animals, have, rights, should, not, be, regarded, as, property, are, not, necessary, to, use, and, should, never, be, used, by, humans, live, export, of, animals, has, risen, to, meet, increased, global, demand, for, livestock, such, as, in, the, middle, east, animal, rights, activists, have, objected, to, long, distance, transport, of, animals, one, result, was, the, banning, of,
