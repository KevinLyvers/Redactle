a, hammer, is, a, tool, most, often, a, hand, tool, consisting, of, a, weighted, head, fixed, to, a, long, handle, that, is, swung, to, deliver, an, impact, to, a, small, area, of, an, object, this, can, be, for, example, to, drive, nails, into, wood, to, shape, metal, as, with, a, forge, or, to, crush, rock, hammers, are, used, for, a, wide, range, of, driving, shaping, breaking, and, non, destructive, striking, applications, traditional, disciplines, include, carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and, percussive, musicianship, as, with, a, gong, hammering, is, use, of, a, hammer, in, its, strike, capacity, as, opposed, to, prying, with, a, secondary, claw, or, grappling, with, a, secondary, hook, carpentry, and, blacksmithing, hammers, are, generally, wielded, from, a, stationary, stance, against, a, stationary, target, as, gripped, and, propelled, with, one, arm, in, a, lengthy, downward, planar, arc, downward, to, add, kinetic, energy, to, the, impact, pivoting, mainly, around, the, shoulder, and, elbow, with, a, small, but, brisk, wrist, rotation, shortly, before, impact, for, extreme, impact, concurrent, motions, of, the, torso, and, knee, can, lower, the, shoulder, joint, during, the, swing, to, further, increase, the, length, of, the, swing, arc, but, this, is, tiring, war, hammers, are, often, wielded, in, non, vertical, planes, of, motion, with, a, far, greater, share, of, energy, input, provided, from, the, legs, and, hips, which, can, also, include, a, lunging, motion, especially, against, moving, targets, small, mallets, can, be, swung, from, the, wrists, in, a, smaller, motion, permitting, a, much, higher, cadence, of, repeated, strikes, use, of, hammers, and, heavy, mallets, for, demolition, must, adapt, the, hammer, stroke, to, the, location, and, orientation, of, the, target, which, can, necessitate, a, clubbing, or, golfing, motion, with, a, two, handed, grip, the, modern, hammer, head, is, typically, made, of, steel, which, has, been, heat, treated, for, hardness, and, the, handle, also, known, as, a, haft, or, helve, is, typically, made, of, wood, or, plastic, ubiquitous, in, framing, the, claw, hammer, has, a, claw, to, pull, nails, out, of, wood, and, is, commonly, found, in, an, inventory, of, household, tools, in, north, america, other, types, of, hammers, vary, in, shape, size, and, structure, depending, on, their, purposes, hammers, used, in, many, trades, include, sledgehammers, mallets, and, ball, peen, hammers, although, most, hammers, are, hand, tools, powered, hammers, such, as, steam, hammers, and, trip, hammers, are, used, to, deliver, forces, beyond, the, capacity, of, the, human, arm, there, are, over, 40, different, types, of, hammers, that, have, many, different, types, of, uses, for, hand, hammers, the, grip, of, the, shaft, is, an, important, consideration, many, forms, of, hammering, by, hand, are, heavy, work, and, perspiration, can, lead, to, slippage, from, the, hand, turning, a, hammer, into, a, dangerous, or, destructive, uncontrolled, projectile, steel, is, highly, elastic, and, transmits, shock, and, vibration, steel, is, also, a, good, conductor, of, heat, making, it, unsuitable, for, contact, with, bare, skin, in, frigid, conditions, modern, hammers, with, steel, shafts, are, almost, invariably, clad, with, a, synthetic, polymer, to, improve, grip, dampen, vibration, and, to, provide, thermal, insulation, a, suitably, contoured, handle, is, also, an, important, aid, in, providing, a, secure, grip, during, heavy, use, traditional, wooden, handles, were, reasonably, good, in, all, regards, but, lack, strength, and, durability, compared, to, steel, and, there, are, safety, issues, with, wooden, handles, if, the, head, becomes, loose, on, the, shaft, the, high, elasticity, of, the, steel, head, is, important, in, energy, transfer, especially, when, used, in, conjunction, with, an, equally, elastic, anvil, in, terms, of, human, physiology, many, uses, of, the, hammer, involve, coordinated, ballistic, movements, under, intense, muscular, forces, which, must, be, planned, in, advance, at, the, neuromuscular, level, as, they, occur, too, rapidly, for, conscious, adjustment, in, flight, for, this, reason, accurate, striking, at, speed, requires, more, practice, than, a, tapping, movement, to, the, same, target, area, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, cognitive, demands, for, pre, planning, sequencing, and, accurate, timing, associated, with, the, related, ballistic, movements, of, throwing, clubbing, and, hammering, precipitated, aspects, of, brain, evolution, in, early, hominids, the, use, of, simple, hammers, dates, to, around, 3, 3, million, years, ago, according, to, the, 2012, find, made, by, sonia, harmand, and, jason, lewis, of, stony, brook, university, who, while, excavating, a, site, near, kenya, s, lake, turkana, discovered, a, very, large, deposit, of, various, shaped, stones, including, those, used, to, strike, wood, bone, or, other, stones, to, break, them, apart, and, shape, them, the, first, hammers, were, made, without, handles, stones, attached, to, sticks, with, strips, of, leather, or, animal, sinew, were, being, used, as, hammers, with, handles, by, about, 30, 000, bce, during, the, middle, of, the, paleolithic, stone, age, the, addition, of, a, handle, gave, the, user, better, control, and, less, accidents, the, hammer, became, the, primary, tool, used, for, building, food, and, protection, the, hammer, s, archaeological, record, shows, that, it, may, be, the, oldest, tool, for, which, definite, evidence, exists, a, traditional, hand, held, hammer, consists, of, a, separate, head, and, a, handle, which, can, be, fastened, together, by, means, of, a, special, wedge, made, for, the, purpose, or, by, glue, or, both, this, two, piece, design, is, often, used, to, combine, a, dense, metallic, striking, head, with, a, non, metallic, mechanical, shock, absorbing, handle, to, reduce, user, fatigue, from, repeated, strikes, if, wood, is, used, for, the, handle, it, is, often, hickory, or, ash, which, are, tough, and, long, lasting, materials, that, can, dissipate, shock, waves, from, the, hammer, head, rigid, fiberglass, resin, may, be, used, for, the, handle, this, material, does, not, absorb, water, or, decay, but, does, not, dissipate, shock, as, well, as, wood, a, loose, hammer, head, is, considered, hazardous, due, to, the, risk, of, the, head, becoming, detached, from, the, handle, while, being, swung, becoming, a, dangerous, uncontrolled, projectile, wooden, handles, can, often, be, replaced, when, worn, or, damaged, specialized, kits, are, available, covering, a, range, of, handle, sizes, and, designs, plus, special, wedges, and, spacers, for, secure, attachment, some, hammers, are, one, piece, designs, made, mostly, of, a, single, material, a, one, piece, metallic, hammer, may, optionally, have, its, handle, coated, or, wrapped, in, a, resilient, material, such, as, rubber, for, improved, grip, and, to, reduce, user, fatigue, the, hammer, head, may, be, surfaced, with, a, variety, of, materials, including, brass, bronze, wood, plastic, rubber, or, leather, some, hammers, have, interchangeable, striking, surfaces, which, can, be, selected, as, needed, or, replaced, when, worn, out, a, large, hammer, like, tool, is, a, maul, sometimes, called, a, beetle, a, wood, or, rubber, headed, hammer, is, a, mallet, and, a, hammer, like, tool, with, a, cutting, blade, is, usually, called, a, hatchet, the, essential, part, of, a, hammer, is, the, head, a, compact, solid, mass, that, is, able, to, deliver, a, blow, to, the, intended, target, without, itself, deforming, the, impacting, surface, of, the, tool, is, usually, flat, or, slightly, rounded, the, opposite, end, of, the, impacting, mass, may, have, a, ball, shape, as, in, the, ball, peen, hammer, some, upholstery, hammers, have, a, magnetized, face, to, pick, up, tacks, in, the, hatchet, the, flat, hammer, head, may, be, secondary, to, the, cutting, edge, of, the, tool, the, impact, between, steel, hammer, heads, and, the, objects, being, hit, can, create, sparks, which, may, ignite, flammable, or, explosive, gases, these, are, a, hazard, in, some, industries, such, as, underground, coal, mining, due, to, the, presence, of, methane, gas, or, in, other, hazardous, environments, such, as, petroleum, refineries, and, chemical, plants, in, these, environments, a, variety, of, non, sparking, metal, tools, are, used, primarily, made, of, aluminium, or, beryllium, copper, in, recent, years, the, handles, have, been, made, of, durable, plastic, or, rubber, though, wood, is, still, widely, used, because, of, its, shock, absorbing, qualities, and, repairability, mechanically, powered, hammers, often, look, quite, different, from, the, hand, tools, but, nevertheless, most, of, them, work, on, the, same, principle, they, include, a, hammer, is, a, simple, force, amplifier, that, works, by, converting, mechanical, work, into, kinetic, energy, and, back, in, the, swing, that, precedes, each, blow, the, hammer, head, stores, a, certain, amount, of, kinetic, energy, equal, to, the, length, d, of, the, swing, times, the, force, f, produced, by, the, muscles, of, the, arm, and, by, gravity, when, the, hammer, strikes, the, head, is, stopped, by, an, opposite, force, coming, from, the, target, equal, and, opposite, to, the, force, applied, by, the, head, to, the, target, if, the, target, is, a, hard, and, heavy, object, or, if, it, is, resting, on, some, sort, of, anvil, the, head, can, travel, only, a, very, short, distance, d, before, stopping, since, the, stopping, force, f, times, that, distance, must, be, equal, to, the, head, s, kinetic, energy, it, follows, that, f, is, much, greater, than, the, original, driving, force, f, roughly, by, a, factor, d, d, in, this, way, great, strength, is, not, needed, to, produce, a, force, strong, enough, to, bend, steel, or, crack, the, hardest, stone, the, amount, of, energy, delivered, to, the, target, by, the, hammer, blow, is, equivalent, to, one, half, the, mass, of, the, head, times, the, square, of, the, head, s, speed, at, the, time, of, impact, e, m, v, 2, 2, displaystyle, e, mv, 2, over, 2, while, the, energy, delivered, to, the, target, increases, linearly, with, mass, it, increases, quadratically, with, the, speed, see, the, effect, of, the, handle, below, high, tech, titanium, heads, are, lighter, and, allow, for, longer, handles, thus, increasing, velocity, and, delivering, the, same, energy, with, less, arm, fatigue, than, that, of, a, heavier, steel, head, hammer, a, titanium, head, has, about, 3, recoil, energy, and, can, result, in, greater, efficiency, and, less, fatigue, when, compared, to, a, steel, head, with, up, to, 30, recoil, dead, blow, hammers, use, special, rubber, or, steel, shot, to, absorb, recoil, energy, rather, than, bouncing, the, hammer, head, after, impact, the, handle, of, the, hammer, helps, in, several, ways, it, keeps, the, user, s, hands, away, from, the, point, of, impact, it, provides, a, broad, area, that, is, better, suited, for, gripping, by, the, hand, most, importantly, it, allows, the, user, to, maximize, the, speed, of, the, head, on, each, blow, the, primary, constraint, on, additional, handle, length, is, the, lack, of, space, to, swing, the, hammer, this, is, why, sledgehammers, largely, used, in, open, spaces, can, have, handles, that, are, much, longer, than, a, standard, carpenter, s, hammer, the, second, most, important, constraint, is, more, subtle, even, without, considering, the, effects, of, fatigue, the, longer, the, handle, the, harder, it, is, to, guide, the, head, of, the, hammer, to, its, target, at, full, speed, most, designs, are, a, compromise, between, practicality, and, energy, efficiency, with, too, long, a, handle, the, hammer, is, inefficient, because, it, delivers, force, to, the, wrong, place, off, target, with, too, short, a, handle, the, hammer, is, inefficient, because, it, does, not, deliver, enough, force, requiring, more, blows, to, complete, a, given, task, modifications, have, also, been, made, with, respect, to, the, effect, of, the, hammer, on, the, user, handles, made, of, shock, absorbing, materials, or, varying, angles, attempt, to, make, it, easier, for, the, user, to, continue, to, wield, this, age, old, device, even, as, nail, guns, and, other, powered, drivers, encroach, on, its, traditional, field, of, use, as, hammers, must, be, used, in, many, circumstances, where, the, position, of, the, person, using, them, cannot, be, taken, for, granted, trade, offs, are, made, for, the, sake, of, practicality, in, areas, where, one, has, plenty, of, room, a, long, handle, with, a, heavy, head, like, a, sledgehammer, can, deliver, the, maximum, amount, of, energy, to, the, target, it, is, not, practical, to, use, such, a, large, hammer, for, all, tasks, however, and, thus, the, overall, design, has, been, modified, repeatedly, to, achieve, the, optimum, utility, in, a, wide, variety, of, situations, gravity, exerts, a, force, on, the, hammer, head, if, hammering, downwards, gravity, increases, the, acceleration, during, the, hammer, stroke, and, increases, the, energy, delivered, with, each, blow, if, hammering, upwards, gravity, reduces, the, acceleration, during, the, hammer, stroke, and, therefore, reduces, the, energy, delivered, with, each, blow, some, hammering, methods, such, as, traditional, mechanical, pile, drivers, rely, entirely, on, gravity, for, acceleration, on, the, down, stroke, a, hammer, may, cause, significant, injury, if, it, strikes, the, body, both, manual, and, powered, hammers, can, cause, peripheral, neuropathy, or, a, variety, of, other, ailments, when, used, improperly, awkward, handles, can, cause, repetitive, stress, injury, rsi, to, hand, and, arm, joints, and, uncontrolled, shock, waves, from, repeated, impacts, can, injure, nerves, and, the, skeleton, additionally, striking, metal, objects, with, a, hammer, may, produce, small, metallic, projectiles, which, can, become, lodged, in, the, eye, it, is, therefore, recommended, to, wear, safety, glasses, a, war, hammer, is, a, late, medieval, weapon, of, war, intended, for, close, combat, action, the, hammer, being, one, of, the, most, used, tools, by, man, has, been, used, very, much, in, symbols, such, as, flags, and, heraldry, in, the, middle, ages, it, was, used, often, in, blacksmith, guild, logos, as, well, as, in, many, family, symbols, the, hammer, and, pick, are, used, as, a, symbol, of, mining, in, mythology, the, gods, thor, norse, and, sucellus, celtic, and, gallo, roman, and, the, hero, hercules, greek, all, had, hammers, that, appear, in, their, lore, and, carried, different, meanings, thor, the, god, of, thunder, and, lightning, wields, a, hammer, named, mj, lnir, many, artifacts, of, decorative, hammers, have, been, found, leading, modern, practitioners, of, this, religion, to, often, wear, reproductions, as, a, sign, of, their, faith, in, american, folklore, the, hammer, of, john, henry, represents, the, strength, and, endurance, of, a, man, a, political, party, in, singapore, workers, party, of, singapore, based, their, logo, on, a, hammer, to, symbolize, the, party, s, civic, nationalism, and, social, democracy, ideology, a, variant, well, known, symbol, with, a, hammer, in, it, is, the, hammer, and, sickle, which, was, the, symbol, of, the, former, soviet, union, and, is, strongly, linked, to, communism, and, early, socialism, the, hammer, in, this, symbol, represents, the, industrial, working, class, and, the, sickle, represents, the, agricultural, working, class, the, hammer, is, used, in, some, coats, of, arms, in, former, socialist, countries, like, east, germany, similarly, the, hammer, and, sword, symbolizes, strasserism, a, strand, of, nazism, seeking, to, appeal, to, the, working, class, another, variant, of, the, symbol, was, used, for, the, north, korean, party, workers, party, of, korea, incorporated, with, an, ink, brush, on, the, middle, which, symbolizes, both, juche, and, songun, ideologies, in, pink, floyd, the, wall, two, hammers, crossed, are, used, as, a, symbol, for, the, fascist, takeover, of, the, concert, during, in, the, flesh, this, also, has, the, meaning, of, the, hammer, beating, down, any, nails, that, stick, out, the, gavel, a, small, wooden, mallet, is, used, to, symbolize, a, mandate, to, preside, over, a, meeting, or, judicial, proceeding, and, a, graphic, image, of, one, is, used, as, a, symbol, of, legislative, or, judicial, decision, making, authority, judah, maccabee, was, nicknamed, the, hammer, possibly, in, recognition, of, his, ferocity, in, battle, the, name, maccabee, may, derive, from, the, aramaic, maqqaba, see, judah, maccabee, origin, of, name, the, hammer, the, hammer, in, the, song, if, i, had, a, hammer, represents, a, relentless, message, of, justice, broadcast, across, the, land, the, song, became, a, symbol, of, the, civil, rights, movement
