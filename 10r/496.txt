chain, mail, also, known, as, chain, mail, mail, or, maille, is, a, type, of, armour, consisting, of, small, metal, rings, linked, together, in, a, pattern, to, form, a, mesh, it, was, in, common, military, use, between, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, the, 16th, century, ad, in, europe, while, it, continued, to, be, used, in, asia, africa, and, the, middle, east, as, late, as, the, 17th, century, a, coat, of, this, armour, is, often, called, a, hauberk, or, sometimes, a, byrnie, the, earliest, examples, of, surviving, mail, were, found, in, the, carpathian, basin, at, a, burial, in, horn, jatov, slovakia, dated, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, in, a, chieftain, s, burial, located, in, ciume, ti, romania, its, invention, is, commonly, credited, to, the, celts, but, there, are, examples, of, etruscan, pattern, mail, dating, from, at, least, the, 4th, century, bc, mail, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, much, earlier, scale, armour, mail, spread, to, north, africa, west, africa, the, middle, east, central, asia, india, tibet, south, east, asia, and, japan, herodotus, wrote, that, the, ancient, persians, wore, scale, armour, but, mail, is, also, distinctly, mentioned, in, the, avesta, the, ancient, holy, scripture, of, the, persian, religion, of, zoroastrianism, that, was, founded, by, the, prophet, zoroaster, in, the, 5th, century, bc, mail, continues, to, be, used, in, the, 21st, century, as, a, component, of, stab, resistant, body, armour, cut, resistant, gloves, for, butchers, and, woodworkers, shark, resistant, wet, suits, for, defense, against, shark, bites, and, a, number, of, other, applications, the, origin, of, the, word, mail, are, not, fully, known, one, theory, is, that, it, originally, derives, from, the, latin, word, macula, meaning, spot, or, opacity, as, in, macula, of, retina, another, theory, relates, the, word, to, the, old, french, maillier, meaning, to, hammer, related, to, the, modern, english, word, malleable, in, modern, french, maille, refers, to, a, loop, or, stitch, the, arabic, words, burnus, burnoose, a, hooded, cloak, also, a, chasuble, worn, by, coptic, priests, and, barnaza, to, bronze, suggest, an, arabic, influence, for, the, carolingian, armour, known, as, byrnie, see, below, the, first, attestations, of, the, word, mail, are, in, old, french, and, anglo, norman, maille, maile, or, male, or, other, variants, which, became, mailye, maille, maile, male, or, meile, in, middle, english, civilizations, that, used, mail, invented, specific, terms, for, each, garment, made, from, it, the, standard, terms, for, european, mail, armour, derive, from, french, leggings, are, called, chausses, a, hood, is, a, mail, coif, and, mittens, mitons, a, mail, collar, hanging, from, a, helmet, is, a, camail, or, aventail, a, shirt, made, from, mail, is, a, hauberk, if, knee, length, and, a, haubergeon, if, mid, thigh, length, a, layer, or, multiple, layers, of, mail, sandwiched, between, layers, of, fabric, is, called, a, jazerant, a, waist, length, coat, in, medieval, europe, was, called, a, byrnie, although, the, exact, construction, of, a, byrnie, is, unclear, including, whether, it, was, constructed, of, mail, or, other, armour, types, noting, that, the, byrnie, was, the, most, highly, valued, piece, of, armour, to, the, carolingian, soldier, bennet, bradbury, devries, dickie, and, jestice, indicate, that, there, is, some, dispute, among, historians, as, to, what, exactly, constituted, the, carolingian, byrnie, relying, only, on, artistic, and, some, literary, sources, because, of, the, lack, of, archaeological, examples, some, believe, that, it, was, a, heavy, leather, jacket, with, metal, scales, sewn, onto, it, with, strong, thread, it, was, also, quite, long, reaching, below, the, hips, and, covering, most, of, the, arms, other, historians, claim, instead, that, the, carolingian, byrnie, was, nothing, more, than, a, coat, of, mail, but, longer, and, perhaps, heavier, than, traditional, early, medieval, mail, without, more, certain, evidence, this, dispute, will, continue, the, use, of, mail, as, battlefield, armour, was, common, during, the, iron, age, and, the, middle, ages, becoming, less, common, over, the, course, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, when, plate, armour, and, more, advanced, firearms, were, developed, it, is, believed, that, the, roman, republic, first, came, into, contact, with, mail, fighting, the, gauls, in, cisalpine, gaul, now, northern, italy, the, roman, army, adopted, the, technology, for, their, troops, in, the, form, of, the, lorica, hamata, which, was, used, as, a, primary, form, of, armour, through, the, imperial, period, after, the, fall, of, the, western, empire, much, of, the, infrastructure, needed, to, create, plate, armour, diminished, eventually, the, word, mail, came, to, be, synonymous, with, armour, it, was, typically, an, extremely, prized, commodity, as, it, was, expensive, and, time, consuming, to, produce, and, could, mean, the, difference, between, life, and, death, in, a, battle, historically, mail, makers, were, often, men, but, women, also, undertook, the, work, alice, la, haubergere, was, an, armourer, who, worked, in, cheapside, in, the, early, 1300s, and, in, york, in, 1446, agnes, hecche, inherited, her, father, s, mail, making, tools, to, continue, her, work, after, his, death, mail, from, dead, combatants, was, frequently, looted, and, was, used, by, the, new, owner, or, sold, for, a, lucrative, price, as, time, went, on, and, infrastructure, improved, it, came, to, be, used, by, more, soldiers, the, oldest, intact, mail, hauberk, still, in, existence, is, thought, to, have, been, worn, by, leopold, iii, duke, of, austria, who, died, in, 1386, during, the, battle, of, sempach, by, the, 14th, century, articulated, plate, armour, was, commonly, used, to, supplement, mail, eventually, mail, was, supplanted, by, plate, for, the, most, part, as, it, provided, greater, protection, against, windlass, crossbows, bludgeoning, weapons, and, lance, charges, while, maintaining, most, of, the, mobility, of, mail, however, it, was, still, widely, used, by, many, soldiers, along, with, brigandines, and, padded, jacks, these, three, types, of, armour, made, up, the, bulk, of, the, equipment, used, by, soldiers, with, mail, being, the, most, expensive, it, was, sometimes, more, expensive, than, plate, armour, mail, typically, persisted, longer, in, less, technologically, advanced, areas, such, as, eastern, europe, but, was, in, use, throughout, europe, into, the, 16th, century, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, mail, was, used, as, a, material, for, bulletproof, vests, most, notably, by, the, wilkinson, sword, company, results, were, unsatisfactory, wilkinson, mail, worn, by, the, khedive, of, egypt, s, regiment, of, iron, men, was, manufactured, from, split, rings, which, proved, to, be, too, brittle, and, the, rings, would, fragment, when, struck, by, bullets, and, aggravate, the, injury, the, riveted, mail, armour, worn, by, the, opposing, sudanese, madhists, did, not, have, the, same, problem, but, also, proved, to, be, relatively, useless, against, the, firearms, of, british, forces, at, the, battle, of, omdurman, during, world, war, i, wilkinson, sword, transitioned, from, mail, to, a, lamellar, design, which, was, the, precursor, to, the, flak, jacket, mail, was, also, used, for, face, protection, in, world, war, i, oculist, captain, cruise, of, the, british, infantry, designed, a, mail, fringe, to, be, attached, to, helmets, to, protect, the, upper, face, this, proved, unpopular, with, soldiers, in, spite, of, being, proven, to, defend, against, a, three, ounce, 85, g, shrapnel, round, fired, at, a, distance, of, one, hundred, yards, 91, m, another, invention, a, splatter, mask, or, splinter, mask, consisted, of, rigid, upper, face, protection, and, a, mail, veil, to, protect, the, lower, face, and, was, used, by, early, tank, crews, as, a, measure, against, flying, steel, fragments, spalling, inside, the, vehicle, mail, armour, was, introduced, to, the, middle, east, and, asia, through, the, romans, and, was, adopted, by, the, sassanid, persians, starting, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, where, it, was, supplemental, to, the, scale, and, lamellar, armour, already, used, mail, was, commonly, also, used, as, horse, armour, for, cataphracts, and, heavy, cavalry, as, well, as, armour, for, the, soldiers, themselves, asian, mail, could, be, just, as, heavy, as, the, european, variety, and, sometimes, had, prayer, symbols, stamped, on, the, rings, as, a, sign, of, their, craftsmanship, as, well, as, for, divine, protection, mail, armour, is, mentioned, in, the, quran, as, being, a, gift, revealed, by, allah, to, david, 21, 80, it, was, we, who, taught, him, the, making, of, coats, of, mail, for, your, benefit, to, guard, you, from, each, other, s, violence, will, ye, then, be, grateful, yusuf, ali, s, translation, from, the, abbasid, caliphate, mail, was, quickly, adopted, in, central, asia, by, timur, tamerlane, and, the, sogdians, and, by, india, s, delhi, sultanate, mail, armour, was, introduced, by, the, turks, in, late, 12th, century, and, commonly, used, by, turk, and, the, mughal, and, suri, armies, where, it, eventually, became, the, armour, of, choice, in, india, indian, mail, was, constructed, with, alternating, rows, of, solid, links, and, round, riveted, links, and, it, was, often, integrated, with, plate, protection, mail, and, plate, armour, mail, was, introduced, to, china, when, its, allies, in, central, asia, paid, tribute, to, the, tang, emperor, in, 718, by, giving, him, a, coat, of, link, armour, assumed, to, be, mail, earliest, assumed, reference, to, mail, can, be, found, in, early, 3rd, century, record, by, cao, zhi, being, called, chained, ring, armor, china, first, encountered, the, armour, in, 384, when, its, allies, in, the, nation, of, kuchi, arrived, wearing, armour, similar, to, chains, once, in, china, mail, was, imported, but, was, not, produced, widely, due, to, its, flexibility, comfort, and, rarity, it, was, typically, the, armour, of, high, ranking, guards, and, those, who, could, afford, the, exotic, import, to, show, off, their, social, status, rather, than, the, armour, of, the, rank, and, file, who, used, more, common, brigandine, scale, and, lamellar, types, however, it, was, one, of, the, few, military, products, that, china, imported, from, foreigners, mail, spread, to, korea, slightly, later, where, it, was, imported, as, the, armour, of, imperial, guards, and, generals, in, japan, mail, is, called, kusari, which, means, chain, when, the, word, kusari, is, used, in, conjunction, with, an, armoured, item, it, usually, means, that, mail, makes, up, the, majority, of, the, armour, composition, an, example, of, this, would, be, kusari, gusoku, which, means, chain, armour, kusari, jackets, hoods, gloves, vests, shin, guards, shoulder, guards, thigh, guards, and, other, armoured, clothing, were, produced, even, kusari, tabi, socks, kusari, was, used, in, samurai, armour, at, least, from, the, time, of, the, mongol, invasion, 1270s, but, particularly, from, the, nambokucho, period, 1336, 1392, the, japanese, used, many, different, weave, methods, including, a, square, 4, in, 1, pattern, so, gusari, a, hexagonal, 6, in, 1, pattern, hana, gusari, and, a, european, 4, in, 1, nanban, gusari, the, rings, of, japanese, mail, were, much, smaller, than, their, european, counterparts, they, would, be, used, in, patches, to, link, together, plates, and, to, drape, over, vulnerable, areas, such, as, the, armpits, riveted, kusari, was, known, and, used, in, japan, on, page, 58, of, the, book, japanese, arms, armor, introduction, by, h, russell, robinson, there, is, a, picture, of, japanese, riveted, kusari, and, this, quote, from, the, translated, reference, of, sakakibara, kozan, s, 1800, book, the, manufacture, of, armour, and, helmets, in, sixteenth, century, japan, shows, that, the, japanese, not, only, knew, of, and, used, riveted, kusari, but, that, they, manufactured, it, as, well, karakuri, namban, riveted, namban, with, stout, links, each, closed, by, a, rivet, its, invention, is, credited, to, fukushima, dembei, kunitaka, pupil, of, hojo, awa, no, kami, ujifusa, but, it, is, also, said, to, be, derived, directly, from, foreign, models, it, is, heavy, because, the, links, are, tinned, biakuro, nagashi, and, these, are, also, sharp, edged, because, they, are, punched, out, of, iron, plate, butted, or, split, twisted, links, made, up, the, majority, of, kusari, links, used, by, the, japanese, links, were, either, butted, together, meaning, that, the, ends, touched, each, other, and, were, not, riveted, or, the, kusari, was, constructed, with, links, where, the, wire, was, turned, or, twisted, two, or, more, times, these, split, links, are, similar, to, the, modern, split, ring, commonly, used, on, keychains, the, rings, were, lacquered, black, to, prevent, rusting, and, were, always, stitched, onto, a, backing, of, cloth, or, leather, the, kusari, was, sometimes, concealed, entirely, between, layers, of, cloth, kusari, gusoku, or, chain, armour, was, commonly, used, during, the, edo, period, 1603, to, 1868, as, a, stand, alone, defense, according, to, george, cameron, stone, entire, suits, of, mail, kusari, gusoku, were, worn, on, occasions, sometimes, under, the, ordinary, clothing, in, his, book, arms, and, armor, of, the, samurai, the, history, of, weaponry, in, ancient, japan, ian, bottomley, shows, a, picture, of, a, kusari, armour, and, mentions, kusari, katabira, chain, jackets, with, detachable, arms, being, worn, by, samurai, police, officials, during, the, edo, period, the, end, of, the, samurai, era, in, the, 1860s, along, with, the, 1876, ban, on, wearing, swords, in, public, marked, the, end, of, any, practical, use, for, mail, and, other, armour, in, japan, japan, turned, to, a, conscription, army, and, uniforms, replaced, armour, mail, s, resistance, to, weapons, is, determined, by, four, factors, linkage, type, riveted, butted, or, welded, material, used, iron, versus, bronze, or, steel, weave, density, a, tighter, weave, needs, a, thinner, weapon, to, surpass, and, ring, thickness, generally, ranging, from, 1, 0, 1, 6, mm, diameter, 18, to, 14, gauge, wire, in, most, examples, mail, if, a, warrior, could, afford, it, provided, a, significant, advantage, when, combined, with, competent, fighting, techniques, when, the, mail, was, not, riveted, a, thrust, from, most, sharp, weapons, could, penetrate, it, however, when, mail, was, riveted, only, a, strong, well, placed, thrust, from, certain, spears, or, thin, or, dedicated, mail, piercing, swords, like, the, estoc, could, penetrate, and, a, pollaxe, or, halberd, blow, could, break, through, the, armour, strong, projectile, weapons, such, as, stronger, self, bows, recurve, bows, and, crossbows, could, also, penetrate, riveted, mail, some, evidence, indicates, that, during, armoured, combat, the, intention, was, to, actually, get, around, the, armour, rather, than, through, it, according, to, a, study, of, skeletons, found, at, the, battle, of, visby, gotland, a, majority, of, the, skeletons, showed, wounds, on, less, well, protected, legs, although, mail, was, a, formidable, protection, due, to, technological, advances, as, time, progressed, mail, worn, under, plate, armour, and, stand, alone, mail, as, well, could, be, penetrated, by, the, conventional, weaponry, of, another, knight, the, flexibility, of, mail, meant, that, a, blow, would, often, injure, the, wearer, potentially, causing, serious, bruising, or, fractures, and, it, was, a, poor, defence, against, head, trauma, mail, clad, warriors, typically, wore, separate, rigid, helms, over, their, mail, coifs, for, head, protection, likewise, blunt, weapons, such, as, maces, and, warhammers, could, harm, the, wearer, by, their, impact, without, penetrating, the, armour, usually, a, soft, armour, such, as, gambeson, was, worn, under, the, hauberk, medieval, surgeons, were, very, well, capable, of, setting, and, caring, for, bone, fractures, resulting, from, blunt, weapons, with, the, poor, understanding, of, hygiene, however, cuts, that, could, get, infected, were, much, more, of, a, problem, thus, mail, armour, proved, to, be, sufficient, protection, in, most, situations, several, patterns, of, linking, the, rings, together, have, been, known, since, ancient, times, with, the, most, common, being, the, 4, to, 1, pattern, where, each, ring, is, linked, with, four, others, in, europe, the, 4, to, 1, pattern, was, completely, dominant, mail, was, also, common, in, east, asia, primarily, japan, with, several, more, patterns, being, utilised, and, an, entire, nomenclature, developing, around, them, historically, in, europe, from, the, pre, roman, period, on, the, rings, composing, a, piece, of, mail, would, be, riveted, closed, to, reduce, the, chance, of, the, rings, splitting, open, when, subjected, to, a, thrusting, attack, or, a, hit, by, an, arrow, up, until, the, 14th, century, european, mail, was, made, of, alternating, rows, of, round, riveted, rings, and, solid, rings, sometime, during, the, 14th, century, european, mail, makers, started, to, transition, from, round, rivets, to, wedge, shaped, rivets, but, continued, using, alternating, rows, of, solid, rings, eventually, european, mail, makers, stopped, using, solid, rings, and, almost, all, european, mail, was, made, from, wedge, riveted, rings, only, with, no, solid, rings, both, were, commonly, made, of, wrought, iron, but, some, later, pieces, were, made, of, heat, treated, steel, wire, for, the, riveted, rings, was, formed, by, either, of, two, methods, one, was, to, hammer, out, wrought, iron, into, plates, and, cut, or, slit, the, plates, these, thin, pieces, were, then, pulled, through, a, draw, plate, repeatedly, until, the, desired, diameter, was, achieved, waterwheel, powered, drawing, mills, are, pictured, in, several, period, manuscripts, another, method, was, to, simply, forge, down, an, iron, billet, into, a, rod, and, then, proceed, to, draw, it, out, into, wire, the, solid, links, would, have, been, made, by, punching, from, a, sheet, guild, marks, were, often, stamped, on, the, rings, to, show, their, origin, and, craftsmanship, forge, welding, was, also, used, to, create, solid, links, but, there, are, few, possible, examples, known, the, only, well, documented, example, from, europe, is, that, of, the, camail, mail, neck, defence, of, the, 7th, century, coppergate, helmet, found, in, york, it, was, also, well, documented, as, it, was, found, in, a, well, outside, of, europe, this, practice, was, more, common, such, as, theta, links, from, india, very, few, examples, of, historic, butted, mail, have, been, found, and, it, is, generally, accepted, that, butted, mail, was, never, in, wide, use, historically, except, in, japan, where, mail, kusari, was, commonly, made, from, butted, links, butted, link, mail, was, also, used, by, the, moros, of, the, philippines, in, their, mail, and, plate, armours, mail, is, used, as, protective, clothing, for, butchers, against, meat, packing, equipment, workers, may, wear, up, to, 4, kg, 8, 8, lb, of, mail, under, their, white, coats, butchers, also, commonly, wear, a, single, mail, glove, to, protect, themselves, from, self, inflicted, injury, while, cutting, meat, as, do, many, oyster, shuckers, scuba, divers, sometimes, use, mail, to, protect, them, from, sharkbite, as, do, animal, control, officers, for, protection, against, the, animals, they, handle, in, 1980, marine, biologist, jeremiah, sullivan, patented, his, design, for, neptunic, full, coverage, chain, mail, shark, resistant, suits, which, he, had, developed, for, close, encounters, with, sharks, shark, expert, and, underwater, filmmaker, valerie, taylor, was, among, the, first, to, develop, and, test, shark, suits, in, 1979, while, diving, with, sharks, mail, is, widely, used, in, industrial, settings, as, shrapnel, guards, and, splash, guards, in, metal, working, operations, electrical, applications, for, mail, include, rf, leakage, testing, and, being, worn, as, a, faraday, cage, suit, by, tesla, coil, enthusiasts, and, high, voltage, electrical, workers, conventional, textile, based, ballistic, vests, are, designed, to, stop, soft, nosed, bullets, but, offer, little, defense, from, knife, attacks, knife, resistant, armour, is, designed, to, defend, against, knife, attacks, some, of, these, use, layers, of, metal, plates, mail, and, metallic, wires, many, historical, reenactment, groups, especially, those, whose, focus, is, antiquity, or, the, middle, ages, commonly, use, mail, both, as, practical, armour, and, for, costuming, mail, is, especially, popular, amongst, those, groups, which, use, steel, weapons, a, modern, hauberk, made, from, 1, 5, mm, diameter, wire, with, 10, mm, inner, diameter, rings, weighs, roughly, 10, kg, 22, lb, and, contains, 15, 000, 45, 000, rings, one, of, the, drawbacks, of, mail, is, the, uneven, weight, distribution, the, stress, falls, mainly, on, shoulders, weight, can, be, better, distributed, by, wearing, a, belt, over, the, mail, which, provides, another, point, of, support, mail, worn, today, for, re, enactment, and, recreational, use, can, be, made, in, a, variety, of, styles, and, materials, most, recreational, mail, today, is, made, of, butted, links, which, are, galvanised, or, stainless, steel, this, is, historically, inaccurate, but, is, much, less, expensive, to, procure, and, especially, to, maintain, than, historically, accurate, reproductions, mail, can, also, be, made, of, titanium, aluminium, bronze, or, copper, riveted, mail, offers, significantly, better, protection, ability, as, well, as, historical, accuracy, than, mail, constructed, with, butted, links, japanese, mail, kusari, is, one, of, the, few, historically, correct, examples, of, mail, being, constructed, with, such, butted, links, mail, remained, in, use, as, a, decorative, and, possibly, high, status, symbol, with, military, overtones, long, after, its, practical, usefulness, had, passed, it, was, frequently, used, for, the, epaulettes, of, military, uniforms, it, is, still, used, in, this, form, by, some, regiments, of, the, british, army, mail, has, applications, in, sculpture, and, jewellery, especially, when, made, out, of, precious, metals, or, colourful, anodized, metals, mail, artwork, includes, headdresses, decorative, wall, hangings, ornaments, chess, sets, macram, and, jewelry, for, these, non, traditional, applications, hundreds, of, patterns, commonly, referred, to, as, weaves, have, been, invented, large, linked, mail, is, occasionally, used, as, bdsm, clothing, material, with, the, large, links, intended, for, fetishistic, purposes, chainmail, armor, is, one, of, the, armor, tiers, from, minecraft, which, can, only, be, obtained, from, chest, loot, or, some, mobs, in, some, films, knitted, string, spray, painted, with, a, metallic, paint, is, used, instead, of, actual, mail, in, order, to, cut, down, on, cost, an, example, being, monty, python, and, the, holy, grail, which, was, filmed, on, a, very, small, budget, films, more, dedicated, to, costume, accuracy, often, use, abs, plastic, rings, for, the, lower, cost, and, weight, such, abs, mail, coats, were, made, for, the, lord, of, the, rings, film, trilogy, in, addition, to, many, metal, coats, the, metal, coats, are, used, rarely, because, of, their, weight, except, in, close, up, filming, where, the, appearance, of, abs, rings, is, distinguishable, a, large, scale, example, of, the, abs, mail, used, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, can, be, seen, in, the, entrance, to, the, royal, armouries, museum, in, leeds, in, the, form, of, a, large, curtain, bearing, the, logo, of, the, museum, it, was, acquired, from, the, makers, of, the, film, s, armour, weta, workshop, when, the, museum, hosted, an, exhibition, of, weta, armour, from, their, films, for, the, film, mad, max, beyond, thunderdome, tina, turner, is, said, to, have, worn, actual, mail, and, she, complained, how, heavy, this, was, game, of, thrones, makes, use, of, mail, notably, during, the, red, wedding, scene, typically, worn, under, mail, armour, if, thin, or, over, mail, armour, if, thick, can, be, worn, over, mail, armour, others
