beekeeping, or, apiculture, is, the, maintenance, of, bee, colonies, commonly, in, artificial, beehives, honey, bees, in, the, genus, apis, are, the, most, commonly, kept, species, but, other, honey, producing, bees, such, as, melipona, stingless, bees, are, also, kept, beekeepers, or, apiarists, keep, bees, to, collect, honey, and, other, products, of, the, hive, beeswax, propolis, bee, pollen, and, royal, jelly, other, sources, of, beekeeping, income, include, pollination, of, crops, raising, queens, and, production, of, package, bees, for, sale, bee, hives, are, kept, in, an, apiary, or, bee, yard, the, keeping, of, bees, by, humans, primarily, for, honey, production, began, around, 10, 000, years, ago, a, sample, of, 5, 500, year, old, honey, was, unearthed, from, the, grave, of, a, noblewoman, during, archaeological, excavations, in, 2003, near, the, town, of, borjomi, georgia, ceramic, jars, found, in, the, grave, contained, several, types, of, honey, including, linden, and, flower, honey, domestication, of, bees, can, be, seen, in, egyptian, art, from, around, 4, 500, years, ago, there, is, also, evidence, of, beekeeping, in, ancient, china, greece, and, maya, in, the, modern, era, beekeeping, is, often, used, for, crop, pollination, and, the, collection, of, its, byproducts, such, as, wax, and, propolis, the, largest, beekeeping, operations, are, agricultural, businesses, but, many, small, beekeeping, operations, are, run, as, a, hobby, as, beekeeping, technology, has, advanced, beekeeping, has, become, more, accessible, and, urban, beekeeping, was, described, as, a, growing, trend, as, of, 2016, some, studies, have, found, city, kept, bees, are, healthier, than, those, in, rural, settings, because, there, are, fewer, pesticides, and, greater, biodiversity, in, cities, at, least, 10, 000, years, ago, humans, began, to, attempt, to, maintain, colonies, of, wild, bees, in, artificial, hives, made, from, hollow, logs, wooden, boxes, pottery, vessels, and, woven, straw, baskets, known, as, skeps, depictions, of, humans, collecting, honey, from, wild, bees, date, to, 10, 000, years, ago, beekeeping, in, pottery, vessels, began, about, 9, 000, years, ago, in, north, africa, traces, of, beeswax, have, been, found, in, potsherds, throughout, the, middle, east, beginning, about, 7, 000, bce, domestication, of, bees, is, shown, in, egyptian, art, from, around, 4, 500, years, ago, simple, hives, and, smoke, were, used, and, honey, was, stored, in, jars, some, of, which, were, found, in, the, tombs, of, pharaohs, such, as, tutankhamun, in, the, 18th, century, european, understanding, of, the, colonies, and, biology, of, bees, allowed, the, construction, of, the, movable, comb, hive, so, honey, could, be, harvested, without, destroying, the, entire, colony, honeybees, were, kept, in, egypt, from, antiquity, on, the, walls, of, the, sun, temple, of, nyuserre, ini, from, the, fifth, dynasty, before, 2, 422, bce, workers, are, depicted, blowing, smoke, into, hives, as, they, remove, honeycombs, inscriptions, detailing, the, production, of, honey, are, found, on, the, tomb, of, pabasa, from, the, twenty, sixth, dynasty, c, 650, bce, in, which, cylindrical, hives, are, depicted, along, with, people, pouring, honey, into, jars, an, inscription, records, the, introduction, of, honey, bees, into, the, land, of, suhum, in, mesopotamia, where, they, were, previously, unknown, i, am, shamash, resh, u, ur, the, governor, of, suhu, and, the, land, of, mari, bees, that, collect, honey, which, none, of, my, ancestors, had, ever, seen, or, brought, into, the, land, of, suhu, i, brought, down, from, the, mountain, of, the, men, of, habha, and, made, them, settle, in, the, orchards, of, the, town, gabbari, built, it, they, collect, honey, and, wax, and, i, know, how, to, melt, the, honey, and, wax, and, the, gardeners, know, too, whoever, comes, in, the, future, may, he, ask, the, old, men, of, the, town, who, will, say, thus, they, are, the, buildings, of, shamash, resh, u, ur, the, governor, of, suhu, who, introduced, honey, bees, into, the, land, of, suhu, the, oldest, archaeological, finds, directly, relating, to, beekeeping, have, been, discovered, at, rehov, a, bronze, and, iron, age, archaeological, site, in, the, jordan, valley, israel, thirty, intact, hives, made, of, straw, and, unbaked, clay, were, discovered, in, the, ruins, of, the, city, dating, from, about, 900, bce, by, archaeologist, amihai, mazar, the, hives, were, found, in, orderly, rows, three, high, in, a, manner, that, according, to, mazar, could, have, accommodated, around, 100, hives, held, more, than, one, million, bees, and, had, a, potential, annual, yield, of, 500, kilograms, 1, 100, lb, of, honey, and, 70, kilograms, 150, lb, of, beeswax, and, are, evidence, an, advanced, honey, industry, in, tel, rehov, israel, 3, 000, years, ago, in, ancient, greece, in, crete, and, mycenae, there, existed, a, system, of, high, status, apiculture, that, is, evidenced, by, the, finds, of, hives, smoking, pots, honey, extractors, and, other, beekeeping, paraphernalia, in, knossos, beekeeping, was, considered, a, highly, valued, industry, controlled, by, beekeeping, overseers, owners, of, gold, rings, depicting, apiculture, scenes, rather, than, religious, ones, as, they, have, been, reinterpreted, recently, contra, sir, arthur, evans, aspects, of, the, lives, of, bees, and, beekeeping, are, discussed, at, length, by, aristotle, beekeeping, was, also, documented, by, the, roman, writers, virgil, gaius, julius, hyginus, varro, and, columella, beekeeping, has, been, practiced, in, ancient, china, since, antiquity, in, a, book, written, by, fan, li, or, tao, zhu, gong, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, are, sections, describing, beekeeping, stressing, the, importance, of, the, quality, of, the, wooden, box, used, and, its, effects, on, the, quality, of, the, honey, the, chinese, word, for, honey, mi, chinese, pinyin, m, reconstructed, old, chinese, pronunciation, mjit, was, borrowed, from, proto, tocharian, t, where, is, palatalized, cf, tocharian, b, mit, cognate, with, english, mead, the, ancient, maya, domesticated, a, species, of, stingless, bee, which, they, used, for, several, purposes, including, making, balch, a, mead, like, alcoholic, drink, by, 300, bce, they, had, achieved, the, highest, levels, of, stingless, beekeeping, practices, in, the, world, the, use, of, stingless, bees, is, referred, to, as, meliponiculture, which, is, named, after, bees, of, the, tribe, meliponini, such, as, melipona, quadrifasciata, in, brazil, this, variation, of, beekeeping, still, occurs, today, for, instance, in, australia, the, stingless, bee, tetragonula, carbonaria, is, kept, for, the, production, of, honey, european, natural, philosophers, began, to, scientifically, study, bee, colonies, in, the, 18th, century, eminent, among, these, scientists, were, swammerdam, ren, antoine, ferchault, de, r, aumur, charles, bonnet, and, fran, ois, huber, swammerdam, and, r, aumur, were, among, the, first, to, use, a, microscope, and, dissection, to, understand, the, internal, biology, of, honey, bees, r, aumur, was, among, the, first, to, construct, a, glass, walled, observation, hive, to, better, observe, activities, inside, hives, he, observed, queens, laying, eggs, in, open, cells, but, did, not, know, how, queens, were, fertilized, the, mating, of, a, queen, and, drone, had, not, yet, been, observed, and, many, theories, held, queens, were, self, fertile, while, others, believed, a, vapor, or, miasma, emanating, from, the, drones, fertilized, queens, without, physical, contact, huber, was, the, first, to, prove, by, observation, and, experiment, that, drones, physically, inseminate, queens, outside, the, confines, of, the, hive, usually, a, great, distance, away, following, r, aumur, s, design, huber, built, improved, glass, walled, observation, hives, and, sectional, hives, that, could, be, opened, like, the, leaves, of, a, book, this, allowed, the, inspection, of, individual, wax, combs, and, greatly, improved, direct, observation, of, hive, activity, although, he, went, blind, before, he, was, twenty, huber, employed, a, secretary, named, fran, ois, burnens, to, make, daily, observations, conduct, experiment, and, keep, accurate, notes, for, more, than, twenty, years, huber, confirmed, a, hive, consists, of, one, queen, who, is, the, mother, of, every, female, worker, and, male, drone, in, the, colony, he, was, also, the, first, to, confirm, mating, with, drones, takes, place, outside, hives, and, that, queens, are, inseminated, in, successive, matings, with, male, drones, which, occur, high, in, the, air, at, a, great, distance, from, the, hive, together, huber, and, burnens, dissected, bees, under, the, microscope, and, were, among, the, first, to, describe, the, ovaries, and, spermatheca, sperm, store, of, queens, as, well, as, the, penis, of, male, drones, huber, is, regarded, as, the, father, of, modern, bee, science, and, his, work, nouvelles, observations, sur, les, abeilles, new, observations, on, bees, revealed, all, of, the, basic, scientific, facts, of, the, biology, and, ecology, of, honeybees, before, the, invention, of, the, movable, comb, hive, the, harvesting, of, honey, frequently, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, the, whole, colony, the, wild, hive, was, broken, into, using, smoke, to, quieten, the, bees, the, honeycombs, were, pulled, out, and, either, immediately, eaten, whole, or, crushed, along, with, the, eggs, larvae, and, honey, they, held, a, sieve, or, basket, was, used, to, separate, the, liquid, honey, from, the, demolished, brood, nest, in, medieval, times, in, northern, europe, although, skeps, and, other, containers, were, made, to, house, bees, the, honey, and, wax, were, still, extracted, after, the, bee, colony, was, killed, this, was, usually, accomplished, by, using, burning, sulfur, to, suffocate, the, colony, without, harming, the, honey, within, it, was, impossible, to, replace, old, dark, brown, brood, comb, in, which, larval, bees, are, constricted, by, layers, of, shed, pupal, skins, the, movable, frames, of, modern, hives, are, considered, to, have, been, developed, from, the, traditional, basket, top, bar, movable, comb, hives, of, greece, which, allowed, the, beekeeper, to, avoid, killing, the, bees, the, oldest, evidence, of, their, use, dates, to, 1669, although, it, is, probable, their, use, is, more, than, 3, 000, years, old, intermediate, stages, in, the, transition, from, older, methods, of, beekeeping, were, recorded, in, 1768, by, thomas, wildman, who, described, advances, over, the, destructive, skep, based, method, so, bees, no, longer, had, to, be, killed, to, harvest, their, honey, wildman, fixed, an, array, of, parallel, wooden, bars, across, the, top, of, a, straw, hive, 10, inches, 25, cm, in, diameter, so, that, there, are, in, all, seven, bars, of, deal, to, which, the, bees, fix, their, combs, foreshadowing, future, uses, of, movable, comb, hives, he, also, described, using, such, hives, in, a, multi, story, configuration, foreshadowing, the, modern, use, of, supers, he, added, successive, straw, hives, below, and, later, removed, the, ones, above, when, free, of, brood, and, filled, with, honey, so, the, bees, could, be, separately, preserved, at, the, harvest, the, following, season, wildman, also, described, the, use, of, hives, with, sliding, frames, in, which, the, bees, would, build, their, comb, wildman, s, book, acknowledges, the, advances, in, knowledge, of, bees, made, by, swammerdam, maraldi, and, de, r, aumur, he, includes, a, lengthy, translation, of, r, aumur, s, account, of, the, natural, history, of, bees, wildman, also, describes, the, initiatives, of, others, in, designing, hives, for, the, preservation, of, bees, when, taking, the, harvest, citing, reports, from, brittany, in, the, 1750s, due, to, the, comte, de, la, bourdonnaye, another, hive, design, was, invented, by, rev, john, thorley, in, 1744, the, hive, was, placed, in, a, bell, jar, that, was, screwed, onto, a, wicker, basket, the, bees, were, free, to, move, from, the, basket, to, the, jar, and, honey, was, produced, and, stored, in, the, jar, the, hive, was, designed, to, keep, the, bees, from, swarming, as, much, as, they, would, have, in, other, hive, designs, in, the, 19th, century, changes, in, beekeeping, practice, were, completed, through, the, development, of, the, movable, comb, hive, by, the, american, lorenzo, lorraine, langstroth, who, was, the, first, person, to, make, practical, use, of, huber, s, earlier, discovery, of, a, specific, spatial, distance, between, the, wax, combs, later, called, the, bee, space, which, bees, do, not, block, with, wax, but, keep, as, a, free, passage, having, determined, this, bee, space, which, is, commonly, given, as, between, 6, and, 9, mm, 0, 24, and, 0, 35, in, though, up, to, 15, mm, 0, 59, in, has, been, found, in, populations, in, ethiopia, langstroth, then, designed, a, series, of, wooden, frames, within, a, rectangular, hive, box, carefully, maintaining, the, correct, space, between, successive, frames, he, found, the, bees, would, build, parallel, honeycombs, in, the, box, without, bonding, them, to, each, other, or, to, the, hive, walls, this, enables, the, beekeeper, to, slide, any, frame, out, of, the, hive, for, inspection, without, harming, the, bees, or, the, comb, and, protecting, the, eggs, larvae, and, pupae, in, the, cells, it, also, meant, combs, containing, honey, could, be, gently, removed, and, the, honey, extracted, without, destroying, the, comb, the, emptied, honeycombs, could, then, be, returned, intact, to, the, bees, for, refilling, langstroth, s, book, the, hive, and, honey, bee, 1853, describes, his, rediscovery, of, the, bee, space, and, the, development, of, his, patent, movable, comb, hive, the, invention, and, development, of, the, movable, comb, hive, enabled, the, growth, of, large, scale, commercial, honey, production, in, both, europe, and, the, u, s, langstroth, s, design, of, movable, comb, hives, was, adopted, by, apiarists, and, inventors, in, both, north, america, and, europe, and, a, wide, range, of, moveable, comb, hives, were, developed, in, england, france, germany, and, the, united, states, classic, designs, evolved, in, each, country, dadant, hives, and, langstroth, hives, are, still, dominant, in, the, u, s, in, france, the, de, layens, trough, hive, became, popular, in, the, uk, a, british, national, hive, became, standard, by, the, 1930s, although, in, scotland, the, smaller, smith, hive, is, still, popular, in, some, scandinavian, countries, and, in, russia, the, traditional, trough, hive, persisted, until, late, in, the, 20th, century, and, is, still, kept, in, some, areas, the, langstroth, and, dadant, designs, however, remain, ubiquitous, in, the, u, s, and, in, many, parts, of, europe, though, sweden, denmark, germany, france, and, italy, all, have, their, own, national, hive, designs, regional, variations, of, hive, were, developed, according, to, climate, floral, productivity, and, reproductive, characteristics, of, the, subspecies, of, native, honey, bees, in, each, bio, region, the, differences, in, hive, dimensions, are, insignificant, in, comparison, to, the, common, factors, in, these, hives, they, are, all, square, or, rectangular, they, all, use, movable, wooden, frames, and, they, all, consist, of, a, floor, brood, box, honey, super, crown, board, and, roof, hives, have, traditionally, been, constructed, from, cedar, pine, or, cypress, wood, but, in, recent, years, hives, made, from, injection, molded, dense, polystyrene, have, become, increasingly, common, hives, also, use, queen, excluders, between, the, brood, box, and, honey, supers, to, keep, the, queen, from, laying, eggs, in, cells, next, to, those, containing, honey, intended, for, consumption, with, the, 20th, century, advent, of, mite, pests, hive, floors, are, often, replaced, either, temporarily, or, permanently, with, a, wire, mesh, and, a, removable, tray, in, 2015, the, flow, hive, system, was, invented, in, australia, by, cedar, anderson, and, his, father, stuart, anderson, whose, design, allows, honey, to, be, extracted, without, cumbersome, centrifuge, equipment, in, the, 19th, century, improvements, were, made, in, the, design, and, production, of, beehives, systems, of, management, and, husbandry, stock, improvement, by, selective, breeding, honey, extraction, and, marketing, notable, innovators, of, modern, beekeeping, include, petro, prokopovych, used, frames, with, channels, in, the, side, of, the, woodwork, these, were, packed, side, by, side, in, stacked, boxes, bees, traveled, between, frames, and, boxes, via, these, channels, which, were, similar, to, the, cutouts, in, the, sides, of, modern, wooden, sections, jan, dzier, on, beehive, design, has, influenced, modern, beehives, fran, ois, huber, made, significant, discoveries, about, the, bee, life, cycle, and, communication, between, bees, despite, being, blind, huber, discovered, a, large, amount, of, information, about, the, queen, bee, s, mating, habits, and, her, contact, with, the, rest, of, the, hive, his, work, was, published, as, new, observations, on, the, natural, history, of, bees, l, l, langstroth, has, influenced, modern, beekeeping, practice, more, than, anyone, else, his, book, the, hive, and, honey, bee, was, published, in, 1853, moses, quinby, author, of, mysteries, of, bee, keeping, explained, invented, the, bee, smoker, in, 1873, amos, root, author, of, the, a, b, c, of, bee, culture, which, has, been, continuously, revised, and, remains, in, print, pioneered, the, manufacture, of, hives, and, the, distribution, of, bee, packages, in, the, united, states, a, j, cook, author, of, the, bee, keepers, guide, or, manual, of, the, apiary, 1876, dr, c, c, miller, was, one, of, the, first, entrepreneurs, to, make, a, living, from, apiculture, by, 1878, he, made, beekeeping, his, sole, business, activity, his, book, fifty, years, among, the, bees, remains, a, classic, and, his, influence, on, bee, management, persists, into, the, 21st, century, franz, hruschka, was, an, austrian, italian, military, officer, who, in, 1865, invented, a, simple, machine, for, extracting, honey, from, the, comb, by, means, of, centrifugal, force, his, original, idea, was, to, support, combs, in, a, metal, framework, and, then, spin, them, within, a, container, to, collect, honey, that, was, thrown, out, by, centrifugal, force, this, meant, honeycombs, could, be, returned, to, a, hive, empty, and, undamaged, saving, the, bees, a, vast, amount, of, work, time, and, materials, this, invention, significantly, improved, the, efficiency, of, honey, harvesting, and, catalyzed, the, modern, honey, industry, walter, t, kelley, was, an, american, pioneer, of, modern, beekeeping, in, the, early, and, mid, 20th, century, he, greatly, improved, upon, beekeeping, equipment, and, clothing, and, went, on, to, manufacture, these, items, and, other, equipment, his, company, sold, products, worldwide, and, his, book, how, to, keep, bees, sell, honey, encouraged, a, boom, in, beekeeping, following, world, war, ii, cary, w, hartman, 1859, 1947, lecturer, well, known, beekeeping, enthusiast, and, honey, promoter, was, elected, president, of, the, california, state, beekeepers, association, in, 1921, in, the, uk, practical, beekeeping, was, led, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, a, few, men, pre, eminently, brother, adam, and, his, buckfast, bee, and, r, o, b, manley, author, of, books, including, honey, production, in, the, british, isles, and, inventor, of, the, manley, frame, which, is, still, universally, popular, in, the, uk, other, notable, british, pioneers, include, william, herrod, hempsall, and, gale, ahmed, zaky, abushady, 1892, 1955, was, an, egyptian, poet, medical, doctor, bacteriologist, and, bee, scientist, who, was, active, in, england, and, egypt, in, the, early, twentieth, century, in, 1919, abushady, patented, a, removable, standardized, aluminum, honeycomb, in, the, same, year, he, founded, the, apis, club, in, benson, oxfordshire, which, later, became, the, international, bee, research, association, ibra, in, egypt, in, the, 1930s, abushady, established, the, bee, kingdom, league, and, its, organ, the, bee, kingdom, a, horizontal, top, bar, hive, is, a, single, story, frameless, beehive, in, which, the, comb, hangs, from, removable, bars, that, form, a, continuous, roof, over, the, comb, whereas, the, frames, in, most, current, hives, allow, space, for, bees, to, move, between, boxes, hives, that, have, frames, or, that, use, honey, chambers, in, summer, and, use, management, principles, similar, to, those, of, regular, top, bar, hives, are, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, top, bar, hives, top, bar, hives, are, rectangular, and, are, typically, more, than, twice, as, wide, as, multi, story, framed, hives, commonly, found, in, english, speaking, countries, top, bar, hives, usually, include, one, box, and, allow, for, beekeeping, methods, that, interfere, very, little, with, the, colony, while, conventional, advice, often, recommends, inspecting, each, colony, each, week, during, the, warmer, months, some, beekeepers, fully, inspect, top, bar, hives, only, once, a, year, and, only, one, comb, needs, to, be, lifted, at, a, time, there, are, three, types, of, vertical, stackable, hives, hanging, or, top, access, frame, sliding, or, side, access, frame, and, top, bar, hanging, frame, hive, designs, include, langstroth, the, british, national, dadant, layens, and, rose, which, differ, in, size, and, number, of, frames, the, langstroth, was, the, first, successful, top, opened, hive, with, movable, frames, many, other, hive, designs, are, based, on, the, principle, of, bee, space, that, was, first, described, by, langstroth, and, is, a, descendant, of, jan, dzierzon, s, polish, hive, designs, langstroth, hives, are, the, most, common, size, in, the, united, states, and, much, of, the, world, the, british, national, is, the, most, common, size, in, the, united, kingdom, dadant, and, modified, dadant, hives, are, widely, used, in, france, and, italy, and, layens, by, some, beekeepers, where, their, large, size, is, an, advantage, square, dadant, hives, often, called, 12, frame, dadant, or, brother, adam, hives, are, used, in, large, parts, of, germany, and, other, parts, of, europe, by, commercial, beekeepers, any, hanging, frame, hive, design, can, be, built, as, a, sliding, frame, design, the, az, hive, the, original, sliding, frame, design, integrates, hives, using, langstroth, sized, frames, into, a, honey, house, to, streamline, the, workflow, of, honey, harvest, by, localization, of, labor, similar, to, cellular, manufacturing, the, honey, house, can, be, a, portable, trailer, allowing, the, beekeeper, to, move, hives, to, a, site, and, provide, pollination, services, top, bar, stackable, hives, use, top, bars, instead, of, full, frames, the, most, common, type, is, the, warre, hive, although, any, hive, with, hanging, frames, can, be, converted, into, a, top, bar, stackable, hive, by, using, only, the, top, bar, rather, than, the, whole, frame, this, may, work, less, well, with, larger, frames, where, crosscomb, and, attachment, can, occur, more, readily, most, beekeepers, wear, some, protective, clothing, novice, beekeepers, usually, wear, gloves, and, a, hooded, suit, or, hat, and, veil, experienced, beekeepers, sometimes, choose, not, to, use, gloves, because, they, inhibit, delicate, manipulations, the, face, and, neck, are, the, most, important, areas, to, protect, so, most, beekeepers, wear, at, least, a, veil, defensive, bees, are, attracted, to, the, breath, a, sting, on, the, face, can, lead, to, much, more, pain, and, swelling, than, a, sting, elsewhere, while, a, sting, on, a, bare, hand, can, usually, be, quickly, removed, by, fingernail, scrape, to, reduce, the, amount, of, venom, injected, traditionally, beekeeping, clothing, is, pale, colored, because, of, the, natural, color, of, cotton, and, the, cost, of, coloring, is, an, expense, not, warranted, for, workwear, though, some, consider, this, to, provide, better, differentiation, from, the, colony, s, natural, predators, such, as, bears, and, skunks, which, tend, to, be, dark, colored, it, is, now, known, bees, see, in, ultraviolet, wavelengths, and, are, also, attracted, to, scent, the, type, of, fabric, conditioner, used, has, more, impact, than, the, color, of, the, fabric, stings, that, are, retained, in, clothing, fabric, continue, to, pump, out, an, alarm, pheromone, that, attracts, aggressive, action, and, further, stinging, attacks, attraction, can, be, minimized, with, regular, washing, most, beekeepers, use, a, smoker, a, device, that, generates, smoke, from, the, incomplete, combustion, of, fuels, although, the, exact, mechanism, is, disputed, it, is, said, smoke, calms, bees, some, claim, it, initiates, a, feeding, response, in, anticipation, of, possible, hive, abandonment, due, to, fire, it, is, also, thought, smoke, masks, alarm, pheromones, released, by, guard, bees, or, bees, that, are, squashed, in, an, inspection, the, ensuing, confusion, creates, an, opportunity, for, the, beekeeper, to, open, the, hive, and, work, without, triggering, a, defensive, reaction, many, types, of, fuel, can, be, used, in, a, smoker, as, long, as, it, is, natural, and, not, contaminated, with, harmful, substances, common, fuels, include, hessian, twine, pine, needles, corrugated, cardboard, and, rotten, or, punky, wood, indian, beekeepers, especially, in, kerala, often, use, coconut, fibers, which, are, readily, available, safe, and, cheap, some, beekeeping, supply, sources, also, sell, commercial, fuels, like, pulped, paper, compressed, cotton, and, aerosol, cans, of, smoke, other, beekeepers, use, sumac, as, fuel, because, it, ejects, much, smoke, and, lacks, an, odor, some, beekeepers, use, liquid, smoke, as, a, safer, more, convenient, alternative, it, is, a, water, based, solution, that, is, sprayed, onto, the, bees, from, a, plastic, spray, bottle, a, spray, of, clean, water, can, also, be, used, to, encourage, bees, to, move, on, torpor, may, also, be, induced, by, the, introduction, of, chilled, air, into, the, hive, while, chilled, carbon, dioxide, may, have, harmful, long, term, effects, few, anecdotal, stories, of, using, the, smoke, from, burning, fungi, in, england, or, europe, for, centuries, have, been, published, several, more, recent, studies, describe, anaesthesia, of, honeybees, use, of, smoke, from, burning, fungi, the, fungi, reported, to, have, been, used, to, smoke, bees, are, the, puffballs, lycoperdon, gigantium, l, wahlbergii, and, the, conks, fomes, fomentarius, and, f, igiarius, when, fungi, are, burned, the, characteristic, smell, is, due, to, the, pyrolysis, of, the, keratin, cell, wall, of, fungi, besides, being, a, major, fungi, constituent, keratin, is, found, in, animal, tissues, such, as, hair, or, feathers, anaesthesia, experiments, done, using, smoke, from, pyrolysis, of, l, wahlbergii, human, hair, and, chicken, feathers, showed, no, difference, in, long, term, mortality, of, anesthetized, honeybees, and, non, treated, bees, in, the, same, hive, hydrogen, sulphide, was, identified, as, the, major, combustion, product, that, is, responsible, for, putting, the, bees, to, sleep, note, hydrogen, sulphide, is, toxic, to, humans, at, high, concentrations, most, beekeepers, use, a, hive, tool, when, working, on, their, hives, the, two, main, types, are, the, american, hive, tool, and, the, australian, hive, tool, often, called, a, frame, lifter, they, are, used, to, scrape, off, burr, comb, from, around, the, hive, especially, on, top, of, the, frames, they, are, also, used, to, separate, the, frames, before, lifting, out, of, the, hive, some, beekeepers, believe, pain, and, irritation, from, stings, decreases, if, a, beekeeper, receives, more, stings, and, they, consider, it, important, for, safety, of, the, beekeeper, to, be, stung, a, few, times, a, season, beekeepers, have, high, levels, of, antibodies, mainly, immunoglobulin, g, caused, by, a, reaction, to, the, major, antigen, of, bee, venom, phospholipase, a2, pla, antibodies, correlate, with, the, frequency, of, bee, stings, the, entry, of, venom, into, the, body, from, bee, stings, may, be, hindered, and, reduced, by, protective, clothing, that, allows, the, wearer, to, remove, stings, and, venom, sacs, with, a, simple, tug, on, the, clothing, although, the, stinger, is, barbed, a, worker, bee, s, stinger, is, less, likely, to, become, lodged, into, clothing, than, human, skin, symptoms, of, being, stung, include, redness, swelling, and, itching, around, the, site, of, the, sting, in, mild, cases, pain, and, swelling, subside, in, two, hours, in, moderate, cases, the, red, welt, at, the, sting, site, will, become, slightly, larger, for, one, or, two, days, before, beginning, to, heal, a, severe, reaction, which, is, rare, among, beekeepers, results, in, anaphylactic, shock, if, a, beekeeper, is, stung, by, a, bee, the, sting, should, be, removed, without, squeezing, the, attached, venom, glands, a, quick, scrape, with, a, fingernail, is, effective, and, intuitive, and, ensures, the, venom, injected, does, not, spread, so, the, side, effects, of, the, sting, will, go, away, sooner, washing, the, affected, area, with, soap, and, water, can, also, stop, the, spread, of, venom, ice, or, a, cold, compress, can, be, applied, to, the, sting, area, bees, maintain, the, internal, temperature, of, their, hive, at, about, 35, c, 95, f, their, ability, to, do, this, is, known, as, social, homeostasis, and, was, first, described, by, gates, in, 1914, during, hot, weather, bees, cool, the, hive, by, circulating, cool, air, from, the, entrance, through, the, hive, and, out, again, and, if, necessary, by, placing, water, which, they, fetch, throughout, the, hive, to, create, evaporative, cooling, in, cold, weather, packing, and, insulation, of, the, bee, hive, is, believed, to, be, beneficial, the, extra, insulation, is, believed, to, reduce, the, amount, of, honey, the, bees, consume, and, makes, it, easier, for, them, to, maintain, the, hive, s, temperature, the, desire, for, insulation, encouraged, the, use, of, double, walled, hives, with, an, outer, wall, of, timber, or, polystyrene, and, hives, constructed, from, a, ceramic, there, has, been, considerable, debate, about, the, best, location, for, hives, virgil, thought, they, should, be, located, near, clear, springs, ponds, or, shallow, brooks, wildman, thought, they, should, face, to, the, south, or, west, all, writers, agree, hives, should, be, sheltered, from, strong, winds, in, hot, climates, hives, are, often, placed, under, the, shade, of, trees, in, summer, researchers, in, the, u, s, found, domestic, honey, bees, placed, in, national, parks, compete, with, native, bee, species, for, resources, a, further, review, of, the, literature, concluded, large, concentrations, of, beehives, on, continents, where, they, are, not, native, such, as, north, and, south, america, could, compete, against, the, native, bees, this, however, was, not, as, strongly, observed, in, areas, where, domestic, bees, are, native, such, as, europe, and, africa, where, the, different, bee, species, have, adapted, to, have, a, narrower, overlapping, of, forage, preferences, the, natural, beekeeping, movement, believes, bee, hives, are, weakened, by, modern, beekeeping, and, agricultural, practices, such, as, crop, spraying, hive, movement, frequent, hive, inspections, artificial, insemination, of, queens, routine, medication, and, sugar, water, feeding, practitioners, of, natural, beekeeping, tend, to, use, variations, of, the, top, bar, hive, which, is, a, simple, design, that, retains, the, concept, of, having, a, movable, comb, without, the, use, of, frames, or, a, foundation, the, horizontal, top, bar, hive, as, promoted, by, many, writers, can, be, seen, as, a, modernization, of, hollow, log, hives, with, the, addition, of, wooden, bars, of, specific, width, from, which, bees, hang, their, combs, the, widespread, adoption, of, natural, beekeeping, methods, in, recent, years, can, be, attributed, to, the, 2007, publications, of, natural, beekeeping, by, ross, conrad, and, the, barefoot, beekeeper, by, philip, chandler, which, challenges, many, aspects, of, modern, beekeeping, and, offers, the, horizontal, top, bar, hive, as, a, viable, alternative, to, the, ubiquitous, langstroth, style, movable, frame, hive, a, vertical, top, bar, hive, is, the, warr, hive, based, on, a, design, by, the, french, priest, abb, mile, warr, 1867, 1951, and, popularized, by, david, heaf, in, his, english, translation, of, warr, s, book, l, apiculture, pour, tous, as, beekeeping, for, all, related, to, natural, beekeeping, urban, beekeeping, is, an, attempt, to, revert, to, a, less, industrialized, way, of, obtaining, honey, by, using, small, scale, colonies, that, pollinate, urban, gardens, some, have, found, city, bees, are, healthier, than, rural, bees, because, there, are, fewer, pesticides, and, greater, biodiversity, in, urban, gardens, urban, bees, may, fail, to, find, forage, however, and, homeowners, can, use, their, land, to, help, feed, local, bee, populations, by, planting, flowers, that, provide, nectar, and, pollen, an, environment, of, year, round, uninterrupted, bloom, creates, an, ideal, environment, for, colony, reproduction, using, managed, honeybee, colonies, to, fill, the, ecological, niche, of, pollinators, in, urban, environments, is, also, thought, to, be, crucial, to, preventing, the, formation, of, feral, colonies, by, more, destructive, species, like, the, africanized, honeybee, ahb, modern, beekeepers, have, experimented, with, raising, bees, indoors, in, a, controlled, environment, or, in, indoor, observation, hives, this, may, be, done, for, reasons, of, space, and, monitoring, or, in, the, cooler, months, when, large, commercial, beekeepers, may, move, colonies, to, wintering, warehouses, with, fixed, temperature, light, and, humidity, this, helps, bees, remain, healthy, but, relatively, dormant, these, relatively, dormant, wintered, bees, survive, on, stored, honey, and, new, bees, are, not, born, experiments, in, raising, bees, indoors, for, longer, durations, have, looked, into, more, precise, and, varying, environment, controls, in, 2015, mit, s, synthetic, apiary, project, simulated, springtime, inside, a, closed, environment, for, several, hives, throughout, the, winter, they, provided, food, sources, and, simulated, long, days, and, saw, activity, and, reproduction, levels, comparable, to, the, levels, seen, outdoors, in, warm, weather, they, concluded, such, an, indoor, apiary, could, be, sustained, year, round, if, needed, honey, bee, colonies, are, dependent, on, their, queen, who, is, the, only, egg, layer, although, queens, have, a, three, to, four, year, adult, lifespan, diminished, longevity, of, queens, less, than, a, year, is, commonly, and, increasingly, observed, the, queen, can, choose, whether, to, fertilize, an, egg, as, she, lays, it, fertilized, eggs, develop, into, a, female, worker, bees, and, unfertilized, eggs, become, male, drones, the, queen, s, choice, of, egg, type, depends, on, the, size, of, the, open, brood, cell, she, encounters, on, the, comb, in, a, small, worker, cell, she, lays, a, fertilized, egg, she, lays, unfertilized, drone, eggs, in, larger, drone, cells, when, the, queen, is, fertile, and, laying, eggs, she, produces, a, variety, of, pheromones, that, control, the, behavior, of, the, bees, in, the, hive, these, are, commonly, called, queen, substance, each, pheromone, has, a, different, function, as, the, queen, ages, she, begins, to, run, out, of, stored, sperm, and, her, pheromones, begin, to, fail, as, the, queen, s, pheromones, fail, the, bees, replace, her, by, creating, a, new, queen, from, one, of, her, worker, eggs, they, may, do, this, because, she, has, been, physically, injured, because, she, has, run, out, of, sperm, and, cannot, lay, fertilized, eggs, and, has, become, a, drone, laying, queen, or, because, her, pheromones, have, dwindled, to, the, point, at, which, they, cannot, control, all, of, the, bees, in, the, hive, at, this, juncture, the, bees, produce, one, or, more, queen, cells, by, modifying, existing, worker, cells, that, contain, a, normal, female, egg, they, then, either, supersede, the, queen, without, swarming, or, divide, the, hive, into, two, colonies, through, swarm, cell, production, which, leads, to, swarming, supersedure, is, a, valued, behavioral, trait, because, hive, that, supersedes, its, old, queen, does, not, lose, any, stock, rather, it, creates, a, new, queen, and, the, old, one, either, naturally, dies, or, is, killed, when, the, new, queen, emerges, in, these, hives, bees, produce, only, one, or, two, queen, cells, most, often, in, the, center, of, the, face, of, a, broodcomb, swarm, cell, production, involves, the, creation, of, twelve, or, more, queen, cells, these, are, large, peanut, shaped, protrusions, requiring, space, for, which, reason, they, are, often, located, around, the, edges, commonly, at, the, sides, and, the, bottom, of, the, broodcomb, once, either, process, has, begun, the, old, queen, leaves, the, hive, when, the, first, queen, cells, hatch, and, is, accompanied, by, a, large, number, of, bees, predominantly, young, bees, called, wax, secretors, which, form, the, basis, of, the, new, hive, scouts, are, sent, from, the, swarm, to, find, suitable, hollow, trees, or, rock, crevices, when, one, is, found, the, entire, swarm, moves, in, within, hours, the, new, colony, s, bees, build, new, wax, brood, combs, using, honey, stores, with, which, the, young, bees, have, filled, themselves, before, leaving, the, old, hive, only, young, bees, can, secrete, wax, from, special, abdominal, segments, which, is, why, swarms, tend, to, contain, more, young, bees, often, a, number, of, virgin, queens, accompany, the, first, swarm, known, as, the, prime, swarm, and, the, old, queen, is, replaced, as, soon, as, a, daughter, queen, mates, and, begins, laying, otherwise, she, is, quickly, superseded, in, the, new, hive, different, sub, species, of, apis, mellifera, exhibit, differing, swarming, characteristics, in, north, america, northern, black, races, are, thought, to, swarm, less, and, supersede, more, whereas, the, southern, yellow, and, gray, varieties, are, said, to, swarm, more, frequently, swarming, behavior, is, complicated, because, of, the, prevalence, of, cross, breeding, and, hybridization, of, the, sub, species, italian, bees, are, very, prolific, and, inclined, to, swarm, northern, european, black, bees, have, a, strong, tendency, to, supersede, their, old, queen, without, swarming, these, differences, are, the, result, of, differing, evolutionary, pressures, in, the, regions, in, which, each, sub, species, evolved, according, to, george, s, demuth, the, main, factors, that, increase, the, swarming, tendency, of, bees, are, demuth, attributed, some, of, his, comments, to, snelgrove, some, beekeepers, carefully, monitor, their, colonies, in, spring, for, the, appearance, of, queen, cells, which, are, a, dramatic, signal, the, colony, is, determined, to, swarm, after, leaving, the, old, hive, the, swarm, looks, for, shelter, a, beekeeper, may, capture, it, and, introduce, it, into, a, new, hive, otherwise, the, swarm, reverts, to, a, feral, state, and, finds, shelter, in, a, hollow, tree, or, other, suitable, habitat, a, small, after, swarm, has, less, chance, of, survival, and, may, threaten, the, original, hive, s, survival, if, the, number, of, remaining, bees, is, unsustainable, when, a, hive, swarms, despite, the, beekeeper, s, preventative, efforts, the, beekeeper, may, give, the, reduced, hive, two, frames, of, open, brood, with, eggs, this, helps, replenish, the, hive, more, quickly, and, gives, a, second, opportunity, to, raise, a, queen, if, there, is, a, mating, failure, when, a, colony, accidentally, loses, its, queen, it, is, said, to, be, queenless, the, workers, realize, the, queen, is, absent, after, around, an, hour, as, her, pheromones, in, the, hive, fade, instinctively, the, workers, select, cells, containing, eggs, aged, less, than, three, days, and, dramatically, enlarge, the, cells, to, form, emergency, queen, cells, these, appear, similar, to, large, one, inch, 2, 5, cm, long, peanut, like, structures, that, hang, from, the, center, or, side, of, the, brood, combs, the, developing, larva, in, a, queen, cell, is, fed, differently, than, an, ordinary, worker, bee, in, addition, to, honey, and, pollen, she, receives, a, great, deal, of, royal, jelly, a, special, food, secreted, from, the, hypopharyngeal, gland, of, young, nurse, bees, royal, jelly, dramatically, alters, the, growth, and, development, of, the, larva, so, after, metamorphosis, and, pupation, it, emerges, from, the, cell, as, a, queen, bee, the, queen, is, the, only, bee, in, a, colony, that, has, fully, developed, ovaries, she, secretes, a, pheromone, that, suppresses, the, normal, development, of, ovaries, in, all, of, her, workers, beekeepers, use, the, ability, of, the, bees, to, produce, new, queens, to, increase, their, colonies, in, a, procedure, called, splitting, a, colony, to, do, this, they, remove, several, brood, combs, from, a, healthy, hive, leaving, the, old, queen, behind, these, combs, must, contain, eggs, or, larvae, less, than, three, days, old, and, be, covered, by, young, nurse, bees, which, care, for, the, brood, and, keep, it, warm, these, brood, combs, and, nurse, bees, are, then, placed, into, a, small, nucleus, hive, with, other, combs, containing, honey, and, pollen, as, soon, as, the, nurse, bees, find, themselves, in, this, new, hive, and, realize, they, have, no, queen, and, begin, constructing, emergency, queen, cells, using, the, eggs, and, larvae, in, the, combs, the, common, agents, of, disease, that, affect, adult, honey, bees, include, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, parasites, and, poisons, the, gross, symptoms, displayed, by, affected, adult, bees, are, very, similar, whatever, the, cause, making, it, difficult, to, ascertain, the, causes, without, microscopic, identification, of, microorganisms, or, chemical, analysis, of, poisons, since, 2006, colony, losses, from, colony, collapse, disorder, ccd, have, been, increasing, across, the, world, although, the, causes, of, the, syndrome, are, unknown, in, the, u, s, commercial, beekeepers, have, been, increasing, the, number, of, hives, to, deal, with, higher, rates, of,

unadapted, to, it, varroa, destructor, the, varroa, mite, is, an, established, pest, of, two, species, of, honey, bee, through, many, parts, of, the, world, and, is, blamed, by, many, researchers, as, a, leading, cause, of, ccd, tropilaelaps, mites, of, which, there, are, four, species, are, native, to, apis, dorsata, apis, laboriosa, and, apis, breviligula, but, spread, to, apis, mellifera, after,

example, bee, eaters, as, do, some, robber, flies, such, as, mallophora, ruficauda, which, is, a, pest, of, apiculture, in, south, america, due, to, its, habit, of, eating, workers, while, they, are,
