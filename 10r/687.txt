https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train
a, train, from, old, french, trahiner, from, latin, trahere, to, pull, to, draw, is, a, series, of, connected, vehicles, that, run, along, a, railway, track, and, transport, people, or, freight, trains, are, typically, pulled, or, pushed, by, locomotives, often, known, simply, as, engines, though, some, are, self, propelled, such, as, multiple, units, or, railcars, passengers, and, cargo, are, carried, in, railroad, cars, also, known, as, wagons, or, carriages, trains, are, designed, to, a, certain, gauge, or, distance, between, rails, most, trains, operate, on, steel, tracks, with, steel, wheels, the, low, friction, of, which, makes, them, more, efficient, than, other, forms, of, transport, trains, have, their, roots, in, wagonways, which, used, railway, tracks, and, were, powered, by, horses, or, pulled, by, cables, following, the, invention, of, the, steam, locomotive, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1802, trains, rapidly, spread, around, the, world, allowing, freight, and, passengers, to, move, over, land, faster, and, cheaper, than, ever, possible, before, rapid, transit, and, trams, were, first, built, in, the, late, 1800s, to, transport, large, numbers, of, people, in, and, around, cities, beginning, in, the, 1920s, and, accelerating, following, world, war, ii, diesel, and, electric, locomotives, replaced, steam, as, the, means, of, motive, power, following, the, development, of, cars, trucks, and, extensive, networks, of, highways, which, offered, greater, mobility, as, well, as, faster, airplanes, trains, declined, in, importance, and, market, share, and, many, rail, lines, were, abandoned, the, spread, of, buses, led, to, the, closure, of, many, rapid, transit, and, tram, systems, during, this, time, as, well, since, the, 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and, train, advocates, have, promoted, increased, use, of, trains, due, to, their, greater, fuel, efficiency, and, lower, greenhouse, gas, emissions, compared, to, other, modes, of, land, transport, high, speed, rail, first, built, in, the, 1960s, has, proven, competitive, with, cars, and, planes, over, short, to, medium, distances, commuter, rail, has, grown, in, importance, since, the, 1970s, as, an, alternative, to, congested, highways, and, a, means, to, promote, development, as, has, light, rail, in, the, 21st, century, freight, trains, remain, important, for, the, transport, of, bulk, commodities, such, as, coal, and, grain, as, well, as, being, a, means, of, reducing, road, traffic, congestion, by, freight, trucks, while, conventional, trains, operate, on, relatively, flat, tracks, with, two, rails, a, number, of, specialized, trains, exist, which, are, significantly, different, in, their, mode, of, operation, monorails, operate, on, a, single, rail, while, funiculars, and, rack, railways, are, uniquely, designed, to, traverse, steep, slopes, experimental, trains, such, as, high, speed, maglevs, which, use, magnetic, levitation, to, float, above, a, guideway, are, under, development, in, the, 2020s, and, offer, higher, speeds, than, even, the, fastest, conventional, trains, trains, which, use, alternative, fuels, such, as, natural, gas, and, hydrogen, are, another, 21st, century, development, trains, can, be, sorted, into, types, based, on, whether, they, haul, passengers, or, freight, though, mixed, trains, which, haul, both, exist, by, their, weight, heavy, rail, for, regular, trains, light, rail, for, lighter, transit, systems, by, their, speed, by, their, distance, short, haul, long, distance, transcontinental, and, by, what, form, of, track, they, use, conventional, trains, operate, on, two, rails, but, several, other, types, of, track, systems, are, also, in, use, around, the, world, such, as, monorail, the, railway, terminology, that, is, used, to, describe, a, train, varies, between, countries, the, international, union, of, railways, seeks, to, provide, standardised, terminology, across, languages, the, association, of, american, railroads, provides, terminology, for, north, america, the, british, rail, safety, and, standards, board, defines, a, train, as, a, light, locomotive, self, propelled, rail, vehicle, or, road, rail, vehicle, in, rail, mode, a, collection, of, passenger, or, freight, carriages, connected, together, not, necessarily, with, a, locomotive, is, referred, to, as, a, rake, a, collection, of, rail, vehicles, may, also, be, called, a, consist, a, set, of, vehicles, that, are, coupled, together, such, as, the, pioneer, zephyr, is, called, a, trainset, the, term, rolling, stock, is, used, to, describe, any, kind, of, railway, vehicle, trains, are, an, evolution, of, wheeled, wagons, running, on, stone, wagonways, the, earliest, of, which, were, built, by, babylon, circa, 2, 200, bce, starting, in, the, 1500s, wagonways, were, introduced, to, haul, material, from, mines, from, the, 1790s, stronger, iron, rails, were, introduced, following, early, developments, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1700s, in, 1804, a, steam, locomotive, built, by, british, inventor, richard, trevithick, powered, the, first, ever, steam, train, outside, of, coal, mines, where, fuel, was, readily, available, steam, locomotives, remained, untried, until, the, opening, of, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, in, 1825, british, engineer, george, stephenson, ran, a, steam, locomotive, named, locomotion, no, 1, on, this, 40, kilometer, 25, mile, long, line, hauling, over, 400, passengers, at, up, to, 13, kilometers, per, hour, 8, mph, the, success, of, this, locomotive, and, stephenson, s, rocket, in, 1829, convinced, many, of, the, value, in, steam, locomotives, and, within, a, decade, the, stock, market, bubble, known, as, railway, mania, started, across, the, united, kingdom, news, of, the, success, of, steam, locomotives, quickly, reached, the, united, states, where, the, first, steam, railroad, opened, in, 1829, american, railroad, pioneers, soon, started, manufacturing, their, own, locomotives, designed, to, handle, the, sharper, curves, and, rougher, track, typical, of, the, country, s, railroads, the, other, nations, of, europe, also, took, note, of, british, railroad, developments, and, most, countries, on, the, continent, constructed, and, opened, their, first, railroads, in, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, following, the, first, run, of, a, steam, train, in, france, in, late, 1829, in, the, 1850s, trains, continued, to, expand, across, europe, with, many, influenced, by, or, purchases, of, american, locomotive, designs, other, european, countries, pursued, their, own, distinct, designs, around, the, world, steam, locomotives, grew, larger, and, more, powerful, throughout, the, rest, of, the, century, as, technology, advanced, trains, first, entered, service, in, south, america, africa, and, asia, through, construction, by, imperial, powers, which, starting, in, the, 1840s, built, railroads, to, solidify, control, of, their, colonies, and, transport, cargo, for, export, in, japan, which, was, never, colonized, railroads, first, arrived, in, the, early, 1870s, by, 1900, railroads, were, operating, on, every, continent, besides, uninhabited, antarctica, even, as, steam, locomotive, technology, continued, to, improve, inventors, in, germany, started, work, on, alternative, methods, for, powering, trains, werner, von, siemens, built, the, first, train, powered, by, electricity, in, 1879, and, went, on, to, pioneer, electric, trams, another, german, inventor, rudolf, diesel, constructed, the, first, diesel, engine, in, the, 1890s, though, the, potential, of, his, invention, to, power, trains, was, not, realized, until, decades, later, between, 1897, and, 1903, tests, of, experimental, electric, locomotives, on, the, royal, prussian, military, railway, in, germany, demonstrated, they, were, viable, setting, speed, records, in, excess, of, 160, kilometers, per, hour, 100, mph, early, gas, powered, doodlebug, self, propelled, railcars, entered, service, on, railroads, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 1900s, experimentation, with, diesel, and, gas, power, continued, culminating, in, the, german, flying, hamburger, in, 1933, and, the, influential, american, emd, ft, in, 1939, these, successful, diesel, locomotives, showed, that, diesel, power, was, superior, to, steam, due, to, lower, costs, ease, of, maintenance, and, better, reliability, meanwhile, italy, developed, an, extensive, network, of, electric, trains, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, driven, by, that, country, s, lack, of, significant, coal, reserves, world, war, ii, brought, great, destruction, to, existing, railroads, across, europe, asia, and, africa, following, the, war, s, conclusion, in, 1945, nations, which, had, suffered, extensive, damage, to, their, railroad, networks, took, the, opportunity, provided, by, marshall, plan, funds, or, economic, assistance, from, the, ussr, and, comecon, for, nations, behind, the, iron, curtain, and, advances, in, technology, to, convert, their, trains, to, diesel, or, electric, power, france, russia, switzerland, and, japan, were, leaders, in, adopting, widespread, electrified, railroads, while, other, nations, focused, primarily, on, dieselization, by, 1980, the, majority, of, the, world, s, steam, locomotives, had, been, retired, though, they, continued, to, be, used, in, parts, of, africa, and, asia, along, with, a, few, holdouts, in, europe, and, south, america, china, was, the, last, country, to, fully, dieselize, due, to, its, abundant, coal, reserves, steam, locomotives, were, used, to, haul, mainline, trains, as, late, as, 2005, in, inner, mongolia, trains, began, to, face, strong, competition, from, automobiles, and, freight, trucks, in, the, 1930s, which, greatly, intensified, following, world, war, ii, after, the, war, air, transport, also, became, a, significant, competitor, for, passenger, trains, large, amounts, of, traffic, shifted, to, these, new, forms, of, transportation, resulting, in, a, widespread, decline, in, train, service, both, freight, and, passenger, a, new, development, in, the, 1960s, was, high, speed, rail, which, runs, on, dedicated, rights, of, way, and, travels, at, speeds, of, 240, kilometers, per, hour, 150, mph, or, greater, the, first, high, speed, rail, service, was, the, japanese, shinkansen, which, entered, service, in, 1964, in, the, following, decades, high, speed, rail, networks, were, developed, across, much, of, europe, and, eastern, asia, providing, fast, and, reliable, service, competitive, with, automobiles, and, airplanes, the, first, high, speed, train, in, the, americas, was, amtrak, s, acela, in, the, united, states, which, entered, service, in, 2000, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, increased, awareness, of, the, benefits, of, trains, for, transport, led, to, a, revival, in, their, use, and, importance, freight, trains, are, significantly, more, efficient, than, trucks, while, also, emitting, far, fewer, greenhouse, gas, emissions, per, ton, mile, passenger, trains, are, also, far, more, energy, efficient, than, other, modes, of, transport, according, to, the, international, energy, agency, on, average, rail, requires, 12, times, less, energy, and, emits, 7, 11, times, less, ghgs, per, passenger, km, travelled, than, private, vehicles, and, airplanes, making, it, the, most, efficient, mode, of, motorised, passenger, transport, aside, from, shipping, freight, rail, is, the, most, energy, efficient, and, least, carbon, intensive, way, to, transport, goods, as, such, rail, transport, is, considered, an, important, part, of, achieving, sustainable, energy, intermodal, freight, trains, carrying, double, stack, shipping, containers, have, since, the, 1970s, generated, significant, business, for, railroads, and, gained, market, share, from, trucks, increased, use, of, commuter, rail, has, also, been, promoted, as, a, means, of, fighting, traffic, congestion, on, highways, in, urban, areas, bogies, also, known, in, north, america, as, trucks, support, the, wheels, and, axles, of, trains, trucks, range, from, just, one, axle, to, as, many, as, four, or, more, two, axle, trucks, are, in, the, widest, use, worldwide, as, they, are, better, able, to, handle, curves, and, support, heavy, loads, than, single, axle, trucks, train, vehicles, are, linked, to, one, another, by, various, systems, of, coupling, in, much, of, europe, india, and, south, america, trains, primarily, use, buffers, and, chain, couplers, in, the, rest, of, the, world, janney, couplers, are, the, most, popular, with, a, few, local, variations, persisting, such, as, wilson, couplers, in, the, former, soviet, union, on, multiple, units, all, over, the, world, scharfenberg, couplers, are, common, because, trains, are, heavy, powerful, brakes, are, needed, to, slow, or, stop, trains, and, because, steel, wheels, on, steel, rails, have, relatively, low, friction, brakes, must, be, distributed, among, as, many, wheels, as, possible, early, trains, could, only, be, stopped, by, manually, applied, hand, brakes, requiring, workers, to, ride, on, top, of, the, cars, and, apply, the, brakes, when, the, train, went, downhill, hand, brakes, are, still, used, to, park, cars, and, locomotives, but, the, predominant, braking, system, for, trains, globally, is, air, brakes, invented, in, 1869, by, george, westinghouse, air, brakes, are, applied, at, once, to, the, entire, train, using, air, hoses, for, safety, and, communication, trains, are, equipped, with, bells, horns, and, lights, steam, locomotives, typically, use, steam, whistles, rather, than, horns, other, types, of, lights, may, be, installed, on, locomotives, and, cars, such, as, classification, lights, mars, lights, and, ditch, lights, locomotives, are, in, most, cases, equipped, with, cabs, also, known, as, driving, compartments, where, a, train, driver, controls, the, train, s, operation, they, may, also, be, installed, on, unpowered, train, cars, known, as, cab, or, control, cars, to, allow, for, a, train, to, operate, with, the, locomotive, at, the, rear, to, prevent, collisions, or, other, accidents, trains, are, often, scheduled, and, almost, always, are, under, the, control, of, train, dispatchers, historically, trains, operated, based, on, timetables, most, trains, including, nearly, all, passenger, trains, continue, to, operate, based, on, fixed, schedules, though, freight, trains, may, instead, run, on, an, as, needed, basis, or, when, enough, freight, cars, are, available, to, justify, running, a, train, simple, repairs, may, be, done, while, a, train, is, parked, on, the, tracks, but, more, extensive, repairs, will, be, done, at, a, motive, power, depot, similar, facilities, exist, for, repairing, damaged, or, defective, train, cars, maintenance, of, way, trains, are, used, to, build, and, repair, railroad, tracks, and, other, equipment, train, drivers, also, known, as, engineers, are, responsible, for, operating, trains, conductors, are, in, charge, of, trains, and, their, cargo, and, help, passengers, on, passenger, trains, brakeman, also, known, as, trainmen, were, historically, responsible, for, manually, applying, brakes, though, the, term, is, used, today, to, refer, to, crew, members, who, perform, tasks, such, as, operating, switches, coupling, and, uncoupling, train, cars, and, setting, handbrakes, on, equipment, steam, locomotives, require, a, fireman, who, is, responsible, for, fueling, and, regulating, the, locomotive, s, fire, and, boiler, on, passenger, trains, other, crew, members, assist, passengers, such, as, chefs, to, prepare, food, and, service, attendants, to, provide, food, and, drinks, to, passengers, other, passenger, train, specific, duties, include, passenger, car, attendants, who, assist, passengers, with, boarding, and, alighting, from, trains, answer, questions, and, keep, train, cars, clean, and, sleeping, car, attendants, who, perform, similar, duties, in, sleeping, cars, some, trains, can, operate, with, automatic, train, operation, without, a, driver, directly, present, around, the, world, various, track, gauges, are, in, use, for, trains, in, most, cases, trains, can, only, operate, on, tracks, that, are, of, the, same, gauge, where, different, gauge, trains, meet, it, is, known, as, a, break, of, gauge, standard, gauge, defined, as, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 5, in, between, the, rails, is, the, most, common, gauge, worldwide, though, both, broad, gauge, and, narrow, gauge, trains, are, also, in, use, trains, also, need, to, fit, within, the, loading, gauge, profile, to, avoid, fouling, bridges, and, lineside, infrastructure, with, this, being, a, potential, limiting, factor, on, loads, such, as, intermodal, container, types, that, may, be, carried, train, accidents, sometimes, occur, including, derailments, when, a, train, leaves, the, tracks, and, train, wrecks, collisions, between, trains, accidents, were, more, common, in, the, early, days, of, trains, when, railway, signal, systems, centralized, traffic, control, and, failsafe, systems, to, prevent, collisions, were, primitive, or, did, not, yet, exist, to, prevent, accidents, systems, such, as, automatic, train, stop, are, used, these, are, failsafe, systems, that, apply, the, brakes, on, a, train, if, it, passes, a, red, signal, and, enters, an, occupied, block, or, if, any, of, the, train, s, equipment, malfunctions, more, advanced, safety, systems, such, as, positive, train, control, can, also, automatically, regulate, train, speed, preventing, derailments, from, entering, curves, or, switches, too, fast, modern, trains, have, a, very, good, safety, record, overall, comparable, with, air, travel, in, the, united, states, between, 2000, and, 2009, train, travel, averaged, 0, 43, deaths, per, billion, passenger, miles, traveled, while, this, was, higher, than, that, of, air, travel, at, 0, 07, deaths, per, billion, passenger, miles, it, was, also, far, below, the, 7, 28, deaths, per, billion, passenger, miles, of, car, travel, in, the, 21st, century, several, derailments, of, oil, trains, caused, fatalities, most, notably, the, canadian, lac, m, gantic, rail, disaster, in, 2013, which, killed, 47, people, and, leveled, much, of, the, town, of, lac, m, gantic, the, vast, majority, of, train, related, fatalities, over, 90, percent, are, due, to, trespassing, on, railroad, tracks, or, collisions, with, road, vehicles, at, level, crossings, organizations, such, as, operation, lifesaver, have, been, formed, to, improve, safety, awareness, at, railroad, crossings, and, governments, have, also, launched, ad, campaigns, trains, cannot, stop, quickly, when, at, speed, even, an, emergency, brake, application, may, still, require, more, than, a, mile, of, stopping, distance, as, such, emphasis, is, on, educating, motorists, to, yield, to, trains, at, crossings, and, avoid, trespassing, the, first, trains, were, rope, hauled, gravity, powered, or, pulled, by, horses, steam, locomotives, work, by, burning, coal, wood, or, oil, fuel, in, a, boiler, to, heat, water, into, steam, which, powers, the, locomotive, s, pistons, which, are, in, turn, connected, to, the, wheels, in, the, mid, 20th, century, most, steam, locomotives, were, replaced, by, diesel, or, electric, locomotives, which, were, cheaper, cleaner, and, more, reliable, steam, locomotives, are, still, used, in, heritage, railways, operated, in, many, countries, for, the, leisure, and, enthusiast, market, diesel, locomotives, are, powered, with, a, diesel, engine, which, generates, electricity, to, drive, traction, motors, this, is, known, as, a, diesel, electric, transmission, and, is, used, on, most, larger, diesels, diesel, power, replaced, steam, for, a, variety, of, reasons, diesel, locomotives, were, less, complex, far, more, reliable, cheaper, cleaner, easier, to, maintain, and, more, fuel, efficient, electric, trains, receive, their, current, via, overhead, lines, or, through, a, third, rail, electric, system, which, is, then, used, to, power, traction, motors, that, drive, the, wheels, electric, traction, offers, a, lower, cost, per, mile, of, train, operation, but, at, a, higher, initial, cost, which, can, only, be, justified, on, high, traffic, lines, even, though, the, cost, per, mile, of, construction, is, much, higher, electric, traction, is, cheaper, to, operate, thanks, to, lower, maintenance, and, purchase, costs, for, locomotives, and, equipment, compared, to, diesel, locomotives, electric, locomotives, produce, no, direct, emissions, and, accelerate, much, faster, making, them, better, suited, to, passenger, service, especially, underground, various, other, types, of, train, propulsion, have, been, tried, some, more, successful, than, others, in, the, mid, 1900s, gas, turbine, locomotives, were, developed, and, successfully, used, though, most, were, retired, due, to, high, fuel, costs, and, poor, reliability, in, the, 21st, century, alternative, fuels, for, locomotives, are, under, development, due, to, increasing, costs, for, diesel, and, a, desire, to, reduce, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, trains, examples, include, hydrail, trains, powered, by, hydrogen, fuel, cells, and, the, use, of, compressed, or, liquefied, natural, gas, train, cars, also, known, as, wagons, are, unpowered, rail, vehicles, which, are, typically, pulled, by, locomotives, many, different, types, exist, specialized, to, handle, various, types, of, cargo, some, common, types, include, boxcars, also, known, as, covered, goods, wagons, that, carry, a, wide, variety, of, cargo, flatcars, also, known, as, flat, wagons, which, have, flat, tops, to, hold, cargo, hopper, cars, which, carry, bulk, commodities, and, tank, cars, which, carry, liquids, and, gases, examples, of, more, specialized, types, of, train, cars, include, bottle, cars, which, hold, molten, steel, schnabel, cars, which, handle, very, heavy, loads, and, refrigerator, cars, which, carry, perishable, goods, early, train, cars, were, small, and, light, much, like, early, locomotives, but, over, time, they, have, become, larger, as, locomotives, have, become, more, powerful, a, passenger, train, is, used, to, transport, people, along, a, railroad, line, these, trains, may, consist, of, unpowered, passenger, railroad, cars, also, known, as, coaches, or, carriages, hauled, by, one, or, more, locomotives, or, may, be, self, propelled, self, propelled, passenger, trains, are, known, as, multiple, units, or, railcars, passenger, trains, travel, between, stations, or, depots, where, passengers, may, board, and, disembark, in, most, cases, passenger, trains, operate, on, a, fixed, schedule, and, have, priority, over, freight, trains, passenger, trains, can, be, divided, into, short, and, long, distance, services, long, distance, passenger, trains, travel, over, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, miles, between, cities, the, longest, passenger, train, service, in, the, world, is, russia, s, trans, siberian, railway, between, moscow, and, vladivostok, a, distance, of, 9, 289, kilometers, 5, 772, mi, in, general, long, distance, trains, may, take, days, to, complete, their, journeys, and, stop, at, dozens, of, stations, along, their, routes, for, many, rural, communities, they, are, the, only, form, of, public, transportation, available, short, distance, or, regional, passenger, trains, have, travel, times, measured, in, hours, or, even, minutes, as, opposed, to, days, they, run, more, frequently, than, long, distance, trains, and, are, often, used, by, commuters, short, distance, passenger, trains, specifically, designed, for, commuters, are, known, as, commuter, rail, high, speed, trains, are, designed, to, be, much, faster, than, conventional, trains, and, typically, run, on, their, own, separate, tracks, than, other, slower, trains, the, first, high, speed, train, was, the, japanese, shinkansen, which, opened, in, 1964, in, the, 21st, century, services, such, as, the, french, tgv, and, german, intercity, express, are, competitive, with, airplanes, in, travel, time, over, short, to, medium, distances, a, subset, of, high, speed, trains, are, higher, speed, trains, which, bridge, the, gap, between, conventional, and, high, speed, trains, and, travel, at, speeds, between, the, two, examples, include, the, northeast, regional, in, the, united, states, the, gatimaan, express, in, india, and, the, ktm, ets, in, malaysia, a, number, of, types, of, trains, are, used, to, provide, rapid, transit, to, urban, areas, these, are, distinct, from, traditional, passenger, trains, in, that, they, operate, more, frequently, typically, do, not, share, tracks, with, freight, trains, and, cover, relatively, short, distances, many, different, kinds, of, systems, are, in, use, globally, rapid, transit, trains, that, operate, in, tunnels, below, ground, are, known, as, subways, undergrounds, or, metros, elevated, railways, operate, on, viaducts, or, bridges, above, the, ground, often, on, top, of, city, streets, metro, may, also, refer, to, rapid, transit, that, operates, at, ground, level, in, many, systems, two, or, even, all, three, of, these, types, may, exist, on, different, portions, of, a, network, trams, also, known, in, north, america, as, streetcars, typically, operate, on, or, parallel, to, streets, in, cities, with, frequent, stops, and, a, high, frequency, of, service, light, rail, is, a, catchall, term, for, a, variety, of, systems, which, may, include, characteristics, of, trams, heavier, passenger, trains, and, rapid, transit, systems, there, are, a, number, of, specialized, trains, which, differ, from, the, traditional, definition, of, a, train, as, a, set, of, vehicles, which, travels, on, two, rails, monorails, were, developed, to, meet, medium, demand, traffic, in, urban, transit, and, consist, of, a, train, running, on, a, single, rail, typically, elevated, monorails, represent, a, small, proportion, of, the, train, systems, in, use, worldwide, almost, all, monorail, trains, use, linear, induction, motors, maglev, technology, uses, magnets, to, levitate, the, train, above, the, track, reducing, friction, and, allowing, higher, speeds, the, first, commercial, maglev, train, was, an, airport, shuttle, introduced, in, 1984, at, birmingham, airport, in, england, the, shanghai, maglev, train, opened, in, 2002, is, the, fastest, commercial, train, service, of, any, kind, operating, at, speeds, of, up, to, 431, km, h, 268, mph, japan, s, l0, series, maglev, holds, the, record, for, the, world, s, fastest, train, ever, with, a, top, speed, of, 603, 0, kilometers, per, hour, 374, 7, mph, maglev, has, not, yet, been, used, for, inter, city, mass, transit, routes, with, only, a, few, examples, in, use, worldwide, as, of, 2019, mine, trains, are, operated, in, large, mines, and, carry, both, workers, and, goods, they, are, usually, powered, by, electricity, to, prevent, emissions, which, would, pose, a, health, risk, to, workers, underground, while, they, have, long, been, important, in, transporting, troops, and, military, equipment, trains, have, occasionally, been, used, for, direct, combat, armored, trains, have, been, used, in, a, number, of, conflicts, as, have, railroad, based, artillery, systems, railcar, launched, icbm, systems, have, also, been, used, by, nuclear, weapon, states, for, climbing, steep, slopes, specialized, rack, railroads, are, used, in, order, to, avoid, slipping, a, rack, and, pinion, system, is, used, with, a, toothed, rail, placed, between, the, two, regular, rails, which, meshes, with, a, drive, gear, under, the, locomotive, funiculars, are, also, used, to, climb, steep, slopes, but, instead, of, a, rack, use, a, rope, which, is, attached, to, two, cars, and, a, pulley, the, two, funicular, cars, travel, up, and, down, the, slope, on, parallel, sets, of, rails, when, the, pulley, is, rotated, this, design, makes, funiculars, an, efficient, means, of, moving, people, and, cargo, up, and, down, slopes, the, earliest, funicular, railroad, the, reisszug, opened, around, 1500, rubber, tire, trains, or, rubber, tired, metro, systems, employ, rubber, tires, for, traction, and, guidance, offering, advantages, like, better, acceleration, and, reduced, noise, however, they, come, with, disadvantages, including, higher, costs, for, installation, and, maintenance, faster, tire, wear, and, complex, tire, inflation, mechanisms, that, require, regular, upkeep, nonetheless, these, systems, are, utilized, in, many, urban, rapid, transit, networks, worldwide, enhancing, passenger, comfort, and, urban, transportation, efficiency, freight, trains, are, dedicated, to, the, transport, of, cargo, also, known, as, goods, rather, than, people, and, are, made, up, of, freight, cars, or, wagons, longer, freight, trains, typically, operate, between, classification, yards, while, local, trains, provide, freight, service, between, yards, and, individual, loading, and, unloading, points, along, railroad, lines, major, origin, or, destination, points, for, freight, may, instead, be, served, by, unit, trains, which, exclusively, carry, one, type, of, cargo, and, move, directly, from, the, origin, to, the, destination, and, back, without, any, intermediate, stops, under, the, right, circumstances, transporting, freight, by, train, is, less, expensive, than, other, modes, of, transport, and, also, more, energy, efficient, than, transporting, freight, by, road, in, the, united, states, railroads, on, average, moved, a, ton, of, freight, 702, kilometers, 436, mi, per, gallon, of, fuel, as, of, 2008, an, efficiency, four, times, greater, than, that, of, trucks, the, environmental, and, energy, study, institute, estimates, that, train, transportation, of, freight, is, between, 1, 9, and, 5, 5, times, more, efficient, than, by, truck, and, also, generates, significantly, less, pollution, rail, freight, is, most, economic, when, goods, are, being, carried, in, bulk, and, over, large, distances, but, it, is, less, suited, to, short, distances, and, small, loads, with, the, advent, of, containerization, freight, rail, has, become, part, of, an, intermodal, freight, network, linked, with, trucking, and, container, ships, the, main, disadvantage, of, rail, freight, is, its, lack, of, flexibility, and, for, this, reason, rail, has, lost, much, of, the, freight, business, to, road, competition, many, governments, are, trying, to, encourage, more, freight, back, on, to, trains, because, of, the, community, benefits, that, it, would, bring, from, the, dawn, of, railroading, trains, have, had, a, significant, cultural, impact, worldwide, fast, train, travel, made, possible, in, days, or, hours, journeys, which, previously, took, months, transport, of, both, freight, and, passengers, became, far, cheaper, allowing, for, networked, economies, over, large, areas, towns, and, cities, along, railroad, lines, grew, in, importance, while, those, bypassed, declined, or, even, became, ghost, towns, major, cities, such, as, chicago, became, prominent, because, they, were, places, where, multiple, train, lines, met, in, the, united, states, the, completion, of, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, played, a, major, role, in, the, settling, of, the, western, part, of, the, nation, by, non, indigenous, migrants, and, its, incorporation, into, the, rest, of, the, country, the, russian, trans, siberian, railway, had, a, similar, impact, by, connecting, the, vast, country, from, east, to, west, and, making, travel, across, the, frozen, siberia, possible, trains, have, long, had, a, major, influence, on, music, art, and, literature, many, films, heavily, involve, or, are, set, on, trains, toy, train, sets, are, commonly, used, by, children, traditionally, boys, railfans, are, found, around, the, world, along, with, hobbyists, who, create, model, train, layouts, train, enthusiasts, generally, have, a, positive, relationship, with, the, railroad, industry, though, sometimes, cause, issues, by, trespassing
