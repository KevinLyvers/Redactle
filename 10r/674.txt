https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck
a, truck, or, lorry, is, a, motor, vehicle, designed, to, transport, freight, carry, specialized, payloads, or, perform, other, utilitarian, work, trucks, vary, greatly, in, size, power, and, configuration, but, the, vast, majority, feature, body, on, frame, construction, with, a, cabin, that, is, independent, of, the, payload, portion, of, the, vehicle, smaller, varieties, may, be, mechanically, similar, to, some, automobiles, commercial, trucks, can, be, very, large, and, powerful, and, may, be, configured, to, be, mounted, with, specialized, equipment, such, as, in, the, case, of, refuse, trucks, fire, trucks, concrete, mixers, and, suction, excavators, in, american, english, a, commercial, vehicle, without, a, trailer, or, other, articulation, is, formally, a, straight, truck, while, one, designed, specifically, to, pull, a, trailer, is, not, a, truck, but, a, tractor, the, majority, of, trucks, currently, in, use, are, powered, by, diesel, engines, although, small, to, medium, size, trucks, with, gasoline, engines, exist, in, north, america, electrically, powered, trucks, are, more, popular, in, china, and, europe, than, elsewhere, in, the, european, union, vehicles, with, a, gross, combination, mass, of, up, to, 3, 5, t, 3, 4, long, tons, 3, 9, short, tons, are, defined, as, light, commercial, vehicles, and, those, over, as, large, goods, vehicles, trucks, and, cars, have, a, common, ancestor, the, steam, powered, fardier, nicolas, joseph, cugnot, built, in, 1769, however, steam, wagons, were, not, common, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, roads, of, the, time, built, for, horse, and, carriages, limited, these, vehicles, to, very, short, hauls, usually, from, a, factory, to, the, nearest, railway, station, the, first, semi, trailer, appeared, in, 1881, towed, by, a, steam, tractor, manufactured, by, de, dion, bouton, steam, powered, wagons, were, sold, in, france, and, the, united, states, until, the, eve, of, world, war, i, and, 1935, in, the, united, kingdom, when, a, change, in, road, tax, rules, made, them, uneconomic, against, the, new, diesel, lorries, in, 1895, karl, benz, designed, and, built, the, first, internal, combustion, truck, later, that, year, some, of, benz, s, trucks, were, modified, to, become, busses, by, netphener, a, year, later, in, 1896, another, internal, combustion, engine, truck, was, built, by, gottlieb, daimler, the, daimler, motor, lastwagen, other, companies, such, as, peugeot, renault, and, b, ssing, also, built, their, own, versions, the, first, truck, in, the, united, states, was, built, by, autocar, in, 1899, and, was, available, with, 5, or, 8, horsepower, 4, or, 6, kw, engines, another, early, american, truck, was, built, by, george, eldridge, of, des, moines, iowa, in, 1903, it, was, powered, by, an, engine, with, two, opposed, cylinders, and, had, a, chain, drive, a, 1903, eldridge, truck, is, displayed, at, the, iowa, 80, trucking, museum, walcott, iowa, trucks, of, the, era, mostly, used, two, cylinder, engines, and, had, a, carrying, capacity, of, 1, 5, to, 2, t, 3, 300, to, 4, 400, lb, after, world, war, i, several, advances, were, made, electric, starters, and, 4, 6, and, 8, cylinder, engines, although, it, had, been, invented, in, 1897, the, diesel, engine, did, not, appear, in, production, trucks, until, benz, introduced, it, in, 1923, the, diesel, engine, was, not, common, in, trucks, in, europe, until, the, 1930s, in, the, united, states, autocar, introduced, diesel, engines, for, heavy, applications, in, the, mid, 1930s, demand, was, high, enough, that, autocar, launched, the, dc, model, diesel, conventional, in, 1939, however, it, took, much, longer, for, diesel, engines, to, be, broadly, accepted, in, the, us, gasoline, engines, were, still, in, use, on, heavy, trucks, in, the, 1970s, electrically, powered, trucks, predate, internal, combustion, ones, and, have, been, continuously, available, since, the, mid, 19th, century, in, the, 1920s, autocar, trucks, was, the, first, of, the, major, truck, manufacturers, to, offer, a, range, of, electric, trucks, for, sale, electric, trucks, were, successful, for, urban, delivery, roles, and, as, specialized, work, vehicles, like, forklifts, and, pushback, tugs, the, higher, energy, density, of, liquid, fuels, soon, led, to, the, decline, of, electric, powered, trucks, in, favor, of, first, gasoline, and, then, diesel, and, cng, fueled, engines, until, battery, technology, advanced, in, the, 2000s, when, new, chemistries, and, higher, volume, production, broadened, the, range, of, applicability, of, electric, propulsion, to, trucks, in, many, more, roles, today, manufacturers, are, electrifying, all, trucks, ahead, of, national, regulatory, requirements, with, long, range, over, the, road, trucks, being, the, most, challenging, truck, is, used, in, american, english, and, is, common, in, canada, australia, new, zealand, pakistan, and, south, africa, while, lorry, is, the, equivalent, in, british, english, and, is, the, usual, term, in, countries, like, ireland, malaysia, singapore, and, india, the, first, known, usage, of, truck, was, in, 1611, when, it, referred, to, the, small, strong, wheels, on, ships, cannon, carriages, and, comes, from, trokhos, greek, wheel, in, its, extended, usage, it, came, to, refer, to, carts, for, carrying, heavy, loads, a, meaning, known, since, 1771, its, expanded, application, to, motor, powered, load, carrier, has, been, in, usage, since, 1930, shortened, from, motor, truck, which, dates, back, to, 1901, lorry, has, a, more, uncertain, origin, but, probably, has, its, roots, in, the, rail, transport, industry, where, the, word, is, known, to, have, been, used, in, 1838, to, refer, to, a, type, of, truck, a, goods, wagon, as, in, british, usage, not, a, bogie, as, in, the, american, specifically, a, large, flat, wagon, it, might, derive, from, the, verb, lurry, to, carry, or, drag, along, or, to, lug, which, was, in, use, as, early, as, 1664, but, that, association, is, not, definitive, the, expanded, meaning, of, lorry, self, propelled, vehicle, for, carrying, goods, has, been, in, usage, since, 1911, in, the, united, states, canada, and, the, philippines, truck, is, usually, reserved, for, commercial, vehicles, larger, than, regular, passenger, cars, but, includes, large, suvs, pickups, and, other, vehicles, with, an, open, load, bed, in, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, the, word, truck, is, mostly, reserved, for, larger, vehicles, in, australia, and, new, zealand, a, pickup, truck, is, frequently, called, a, ute, short, for, utility, vehicle, while, in, south, africa, it, is, called, a, bakkie, afrikaans, small, open, container, in, the, united, kingdom, india, malaysia, singapore, ireland, and, hong, kong, lorry, is, used, instead, of, truck, but, only, for, the, medium, and, heavy, types, while, truck, is, used, almost, exclusively, to, refer, to, pickups, often, produced, as, variations, of, golf, cars, with, internal, combustion, or, battery, electric, drive, these, are, used, typically, for, off, highway, use, on, estates, golf, courses, and, parks, while, not, suitable, for, highway, use, some, variations, may, be, licensed, as, slow, speed, vehicles, for, operation, on, streets, generally, as, a, body, variation, of, a, neighborhood, electric, vehicle, a, few, manufactures, produce, specialized, chassis, for, this, type, of, vehicle, while, zap, motors, markets, a, version, of, their, xebra, electric, tricycle, licensable, in, the, u, s, as, a, motorcycle, popular, in, europe, and, asia, many, mini, trucks, are, factory, redesigns, of, light, automobiles, usually, with, monocoque, bodies, specialized, designs, with, substantial, frames, such, as, the, italian, piaggio, shown, here, are, based, upon, japanese, designs, in, this, case, by, daihatsu, and, are, popular, for, use, in, old, town, sections, of, european, cities, that, often, have, very, narrow, alleyways, regardless, of, name, these, small, trucks, serve, a, wide, range, of, uses, in, japan, they, are, regulated, under, the, kei, car, laws, which, allow, vehicle, owners, a, break, in, taxes, for, buying, a, smaller, and, less, powerful, vehicle, currently, the, engine, is, limited, to, 660, cc, displacement, these, vehicles, are, used, as, on, road, utility, vehicles, in, japan, these, japanese, made, mini, trucks, that, were, manufactured, for, on, road, use, are, competing, with, off, road, atvs, in, the, united, states, and, import, regulations, require, that, these, mini, trucks, have, a, 25, mph, 40, km, h, speed, governor, as, they, are, classified, as, low, speed, vehicles, these, vehicles, have, found, uses, in, construction, large, campuses, government, university, and, industrial, agriculture, cattle, ranches, amusement, parks, and, replacements, for, golf, carts, major, mini, truck, manufacturers, and, their, brands, include, daihatsu, hijet, honda, acty, tata, ace, mazda, scrum, mitsubishi, minicab, subaru, sambar, and, suzuki, carry, light, trucks, are, car, sized, in, the, us, no, more, than, 13, 900, lb, 6, 3, t, and, are, used, by, individuals, and, businesses, alike, in, the, eu, they, may, not, weigh, more, than, 3, 5, t, 7, 700, lb, and, are, allowed, to, be, driven, with, a, driving, licence, for, cars, pickup, trucks, called, utes, in, australia, and, new, zealand, are, common, in, north, america, and, some, regions, of, latin, america, asia, and, africa, but, not, so, in, europe, where, this, size, of, commercial, vehicle, is, most, often, made, as, vans, medium, trucks, are, larger, than, light, but, smaller, than, heavy, trucks, in, the, us, they, are, defined, as, weighing, between, 13, 000, and, 33, 000, lb, 5, 9, and, 15, 0, t, for, the, uk, and, the, eu, the, weight, is, between, 3, 5, and, 7, 5, t, 7, 700, and, 16, 500, lb, local, delivery, and, public, service, dump, trucks, garbage, trucks, and, fire, fighting, trucks, are, normally, around, this, size, heavy, trucks, are, the, largest, on, road, trucks, class, 8, these, include, vocational, applications, such, as, heavy, dump, trucks, concrete, pump, trucks, and, refuse, hauling, as, well, as, ubiquitous, long, haul, 4x2, and, 6, 4, tractor, units, road, damage, and, wear, increase, very, rapidly, with, the, axle, weight, the, number, of, steering, axles, and, the, suspension, type, also, influence, the, amount, of, the, road, wear, in, many, countries, with, good, roads, a, six, axle, truck, may, have, a, maximum, weight, of, 44, t, 97, 000, lb, or, more, off, road, trucks, include, standard, extra, heavy, duty, highway, legal, trucks, typically, outfitted, with, off, road, features, such, as, a, front, driving, axle, and, special, tires, for, applications, such, as, logging, and, construction, and, purpose, built, off, road, vehicles, unconstrained, by, weight, limits, such, as, the, liebherr, t, 282b, mining, truck, australia, has, complex, regulations, over, weight, and, length, including, axle, spacing, type, of, axle, axle, group, rear, overhang, kingpin, to, rear, of, trailer, drawbar, length, ground, clearance, as, well, as, height, and, width, laws, these, limits, are, some, of, the, highest, in, the, world, a, b, double, can, weigh, 62, 5, t, 61, 5, long, tons, 68, 9, short, tons, and, be, 25, m, 82, ft, long, and, road, trains, used, in, the, outback, can, weigh, 172, t, 169, 3, long, tons, 189, 6, short, tons, and, be, 53, 5, m, 176, ft, long, the, european, union, also, has, complex, regulations, the, number, and, spacing, of, axles, steering, single, or, dual, tires, and, suspension, type, all, affect, maximum, weights, length, of, a, truck, of, a, trailer, from, axle, to, hitch, point, kingpin, to, rear, of, trailer, and, turning, radius, are, all, regulated, in, additions, there, are, special, rules, for, carrying, containers, and, countries, can, set, their, own, rules, for, local, traffic, the, united, states, federal, bridge, law, deals, with, the, relation, between, the, gross, weight, of, the, truck, the, number, of, axles, the, weight, on, and, the, spacing, between, the, axles, that, the, truck, can, have, on, the, interstate, highway, system, each, state, determines, the, maximum, permissible, vehicle, combination, and, axle, weight, on, state, and, local, roads, uniquely, the, state, of, michigan, has, a, gross, vehicle, weight, limit, of, 164, 000, lb, 74, t, which, is, twice, the, u, s, federal, limit, a, measure, to, change, the, law, was, defeated, in, the, michigan, senate, in, 2019, almost, all, trucks, share, a, common, construction, they, are, made, of, a, chassis, a, cab, an, area, for, placing, cargo, or, equipment, axles, suspension, and, roadwheels, an, engine, and, a, drivetrain, pneumatic, hydraulic, water, and, electrical, systems, may, also, be, present, many, also, tow, one, or, more, trailers, or, semi, trailers, the, cab, or, cabin, is, an, enclosed, space, where, the, driver, is, seated, a, sleeper, is, a, compartment, attached, to, or, integral, with, the, cab, where, the, driver, can, rest, while, not, driving, sometimes, seen, in, semi, trailer, trucks, there, are, several, cab, configurations, a, further, step, from, this, is, the, side, loading, forklift, that, can, be, described, as, a, specially, fabricated, vehicle, with, the, same, properties, as, a, truck, of, this, type, in, addition, to, the, ability, to, pick, up, its, own, load, most, small, trucks, such, as, sport, utility, vehicles, suvs, vans, or, pickups, and, even, light, medium, duty, trucks, in, north, america, china, and, russia, use, gasoline, engines, petrol, engines, but, many, diesel, engined, models, are, now, being, produced, most, of, the, heavier, trucks, use, four, stroke, diesel, engines, with, a, turbocharger, and, intercooler, huge, off, highway, trucks, use, locomotive, type, engines, such, as, a, v12, detroit, diesel, two, stroke, engine, a, large, proportion, of, refuse, trucks, in, the, united, states, employ, cng, compressed, natural, gas, engines, for, their, low, fuel, cost, and, reduced, carbon, emissions, a, significant, proportion, of, north, american, manufactured, trucks, use, an, engine, built, by, the, last, remaining, major, independent, engine, manufacturer, cummins, but, most, global, oems, such, as, volvo, trucks, and, daimler, ag, promote, their, own, captive, engines, in, the, european, union, all, new, truck, engines, must, comply, with, euro, vi, emission, regulations, and, euro, 7, from, the, late, 2020s, has, stricter, exhaust, limits, and, also, limits, air, pollution, from, brakes, and, tires, as, of, 2019, several, alternative, technologies, are, competing, to, displace, the, use, of, diesel, engines, in, heavy, trucks, cng, engines, are, widely, used, in, the, us, refuse, industry, and, in, concrete, mixers, among, other, short, range, vocations, but, range, limitations, have, prevented, their, broader, uptake, in, freight, hauling, applications, heavy, electric, trucks, and, hydrogen, powered, trucks, are, new, to, the, market, in, 2021, but, major, freight, haulers, are, interested, although, cars, will, be, first, the, phase, out, of, fossil, fuel, vehicles, includes, trucks, according, to, the, economist, magazine, electric, lorries, will, probably, run, on, hydrogen, not, batteries, which, are, too, expensive, other, researchers, say, that, once, faster, chargers, are, available, batteries, will, become, competitive, against, diesel, for, all, except, perhaps, the, heaviest, trucks, small, trucks, use, the, same, type, of, transmissions, as, almost, all, cars, having, either, an, automatic, transmission, or, a, manual, transmission, with, synchromesh, synchronizers, bigger, trucks, often, use, manual, transmissions, without, synchronizers, saving, bulk, and, weight, although, synchromesh, transmissions, are, used, in, larger, trucks, as, well, transmissions, without, synchronizers, known, as, crash, boxes, require, double, clutching, for, each, shift, which, can, lead, to, repetitive, motion, injuries, or, a, technique, known, colloquially, as, floating, a, method, of, changing, gears, which, does, not, use, the, clutch, except, for, starts, and, stops, due, to, the, physical, effort, of, double, clutching, especially, with, non, power, assisted, clutches, faster, shifts, and, less, clutch, wear, double, clutching, allows, the, driver, to, control, the, engine, and, transmission, revolutions, to, synchronize, so, that, a, smooth, shift, can, be, made, for, example, when, upshifting, the, accelerator, pedal, is, released, and, the, clutch, pedal, is, depressed, while, the, gear, lever, is, moved, into, neutral, the, clutch, pedal, is, then, released, and, quickly, pushed, down, again, while, the, gear, lever, is, moved, to, the, next, higher, gear, finally, the, clutch, pedal, is, released, and, the, accelerator, pedal, pushed, down, to, obtain, the, required, engine, speed, although, this, is, a, relatively, fast, movement, perhaps, a, second, or, so, while, the, transmission, is, in, neutral, it, allows, the, engine, speed, to, drop, and, synchronize, engine, and, transmission, revolutions, relative, to, the, road, speed, downshifting, is, performed, in, a, similar, fashion, except, the, engine, speed, is, now, required, to, increase, while, the, transmission, is, in, neutral, just, the, right, amount, in, order, to, achieve, the, synchronization, for, a, smooth, non, collision, gear, change, skip, changing, is, also, widely, used, in, principle, the, operation, is, the, same, as, double, clutching, but, it, requires, neutral, be, held, slightly, longer, than, a, single, gear, change, common, north, american, setups, include, 9, 10, 13, 15, and, 18, speeds, automatic, and, automated, manual, transmissions, for, heavy, trucks, are, becoming, more, and, more, common, due, to, advances, both, in, transmission, and, engine, power, in, europe, 8, 10, 12, and, 16, gears, are, common, on, larger, trucks, with, a, manual, transmission, while, conventional, automatic, or, automated, manual, transmissions, would, have, anything, from, 5, to, 12, gears, almost, all, heavy, truck, transmissions, are, of, the, range, and, split, double, h, shift, pattern, type, where, range, change, and, so, called, half, gears, or, splits, are, air, operated, and, always, preselected, before, the, main, gear, selection, a, truck, frame, consists, of, two, parallel, boxed, tubular, or, c, shaped, rails, or, beams, held, together, by, crossmembers, these, frames, are, referred, to, as, ladder, frames, due, to, their, resemblance, to, a, ladder, if, tipped, on, end, the, rails, consist, of, a, tall, vertical, section, two, if, boxed, and, two, shorter, horizontal, flanges, the, height, of, the, vertical, section, provides, opposition, to, vertical, flex, when, weight, is, applied, to, the, top, of, the, frame, beam, resistance, though, typically, flat, the, whole, length, on, heavy, duty, trucks, the, rails, may, sometimes, be, tapered, or, arched, for, clearance, around, the, engine, or, over, the, axles, the, holes, in, rails, are, used, either, for, mounting, vehicle, components, and, running, wires, and, hoses, or, measuring, and, adjusting, the, orientation, of, the, rails, at, the, factory, or, repair, shop, the, frame, is, usually, made, of, steel, but, can, be, made, whole, or, in, part, of, aluminum, for, a, lighter, weight, a, tow, bar, may, be, found, attached, at, one, or, both, ends, but, heavy, tractors, almost, always, make, use, of, a, fifth, wheel, hitch, box, trucks, have, walls, and, a, roof, making, an, enclosed, load, space, the, rear, has, doors, for, unloading, a, side, door, is, sometimes, fitted, chassis, cab, trucks, have, a, fully, enclosed, cab, at, the, front, with, bare, chassis, frame, rails, behind, suitable, for, subsequent, permanent, attachment, of, a, specialized, payload, like, a, fire, truck, or, ambulance, body, concrete, mixers, have, a, rotating, drum, on, an, inclined, axis, rotating, in, one, direction, to, mix, and, in, the, other, to, discharge, the, concrete, down, chutes, because, of, the, weight, and, power, requirements, of, the, drum, body, and, rough, construction, sites, mixers, have, to, be, very, heavy, duty, dual, drive, steer, trucks, are, vehicles, used, to, steer, the, rear, of, trailers, dump, trucks, tippers, in, the, uk, transport, loose, material, such, as, sand, gravel, or, dirt, for, construction, a, typical, dump, truck, has, an, open, box, bed, which, is, hinged, at, the, rear, and, lifts, at, the, front, allowing, the, material, in, the, bed, to, be, unloaded, dumped, on, the, ground, behind, the, truck, flatbed, trucks, have, an, entirely, flat, level, platform, body, this, allows, for, quick, and, easy, loading, but, has, no, protection, for, the, load, hanging, or, removable, sides, are, sometimes, fitted, often, in, the, form, of, a, stakebody, refrigerator, trucks, have, insulated, panels, as, walls, and, a, roof, and, floor, used, for, transporting, fresh, and, frozen, cargo, such, as, ice, cream, food, vegetables, and, prescription, drugs, they, are, mostly, equipped, with, double, wing, rear, doors, but, a, side, door, is, sometimes, fitted, refuse, trucks, have, a, specialized, body, for, collecting, and, often, compacting, trash, collected, from, municipal, commercial, and, industrial, sites, this, application, has, the, widest, use, of, the, cab, over, configuration, in, north, america, to, provide, better, maneuverability, in, tight, situations, they, are, also, among, the, most, severe, duty, and, highest, gvwr, trucks, on, public, roads, semi, tractors, artics, in, the, uk, have, a, fifth, wheel, for, towing, a, semi, trailer, instead, of, a, body, tank, trucks, tankers, in, the, uk, are, designed, to, carry, liquids, or, gases, they, usually, have, a, cylindrical, tank, lying, horizontally, on, the, chassis, many, variants, exist, due, to, the, wide, variety, of, liquids, and, gases, that, can, be, transported, wreckers, recovery, lorries, in, the, uk, are, used, to, recover, and, or, tow, disabled, vehicles, they, are, normally, equipped, with, a, boom, with, a, cable, wheel, chassis, lifts, are, becoming, common, on, newer, trucks, in, many, countries, driving, a, truck, requires, a, special, driving, license, the, requirements, and, limitations, vary, with, each, different, jurisdiction, in, australia, a, truck, driver, s, license, is, required, for, any, motor, vehicle, with, a, gross, vehicle, mass, gvm, exceeding, 4, 5, t, 4, 4, long, tons, 5, 0, short, tons, the, motor, vehicles, classes, are, further, expanded, as, there, is, also, a, heavy, vehicle, transmission, condition, for, a, license, class, hc, hr, or, mc, test, passed, in, a, vehicle, fitted, with, an, automatic, or, synchromesh, transmission, a, driver, s, license, will, be, restricted, to, vehicles, of, that, class, fitted, with, a, synchromesh, or, automatic, transmission, to, have, the, condition, removed, a, person, needs, to, pass, a, practical, driving, test, in, a, vehicle, with, non, synchromesh, transmission, constant, mesh, or, crash, box, driving, licensing, has, been, harmonized, throughout, the, european, union, and, the, eea, and, practically, all, european, non, member, states, so, that, common, rules, apply, within, europe, see, european, driving, licence, as, an, overview, to, drive, a, vehicle, weighing, more, than, 7, 5, t, 7, 4, long, tons, 8, 3, short, tons, for, commercial, purposes, requires, a, specialist, license, the, type, varies, depending, on, the, use, of, the, vehicle, and, number, of, seats, for, licenses, first, acquired, after, 1997, that, weight, was, reduced, to, 3, 5, t, 3, 4, long, tons, 3, 9, short, tons, not, including, trailers, since, 2013, the, c1, license, category, allows, driving, vehicles, over, 3, 5, and, up, to, 7, 5, tonnes, the, c, license, category, allows, driving, vehicles, over, 3, 5, tonnes, with, a, trailer, up, to, 750, kg, and, the, ce, category, allows, driving, category, c, vehicles, with, a, trailer, over, 750, kg, to, drive, any, vehicle, with, a, gvm, exceeding, 3, 5, t, 3, 4, long, tons, 3, 9, short, tons, a, code, c1, drivers, license, is, required, furthermore, if, the, vehicle, exceeds, 16, t, 15, 7, long, tons, 17, 6, short, tons, a, code, c, license, becomes, necessary, to, drive, any, vehicle, in, south, africa, towing, a, trailer, with, a, gvm, more, than, 7, 5, t, 7, 4, long, tons, 8, 3, short, tons, further, restrictions, apply, and, the, driver, must, possess, a, license, suitable, for, the, gvm, of, the, total, combination, as, well, as, an, articulated, endorsement, this, is, indicated, with, the, letter, e, prefixing, the, license, code, in, addition, any, vehicle, designed, to, carry, goods, or, passengers, may, only, be, driven, by, a, driver, possessing, a, public, driver, s, permit, or, prdp, of, the, applicable, type, this, is, an, additional, license, that, is, added, to, the, dl, card, of, the, operator, and, subject, to, annual, renewal, unlike, the, five, year, renewal, period, of, a, normal, license, the, requirements, for, obtaining, the, different, classes, are, below, in, the, united, states, a, commercial, driver, s, license, is, required, to, drive, any, type, of, commercial, vehicle, weighing, 26, 001, lb, 11, 794, kg, or, more, the, federal, government, regulates, how, many, hours, a, driver, may, be, on, the, clock, how, much, rest, and, sleep, time, is, required, e, g, 11, hours, driving, 14, hours, on, duty, followed, by, 10, hours, off, with, a, maximum, of, 70, hours, 8, days, or, 60, hours, 7, days, 34, hours, restart, violations, are, often, subject, to, significant, penalties, instruments, to, track, each, driver, s, hours, must, sometimes, be, fitted, in, 2006, the, us, trucking, industry, employed, 1, 8, million, drivers, of, heavy, trucks, there, is, a, shortage, of, willing, trained, long, distance, truck, drivers, part, of, the, reason, for, this, is, the, economic, fallout, from, deregulation, of, the, trucking, industry, michael, h, belzer, associate, professor, in, the, economics, department, at, wayne, state, university, and, co, author, of, sweatshops, on, wheels, winners, and, losers, in, trucking, deregulation, argues, that, low, pay, bad, working, conditions, and, unsafe, conditions, have, been, a, direct, result, of, deregulation, the, book, cites, poor, working, conditions, and, an, unfair, pay, system, as, responsible, for, high, annual, employee, turnover, in, the, industry, in, 2018, in, the, us, 5, 096, large, trucks, and, buses, were, involved, in, fatal, crashes, like, cars, trucks, contribute, to, air, noise, and, water, pollution, unlike, cars, as, of, 2022, most, trucks, run, on, diesel, and, diesel, exhaust, is, especially, dangerous, for, health, some, countries, outside, the, eu, have, different, vehicle, emission, standards, for, trucks, and, cars, nox, and, particulates, emitted, by, trucks, are, very, dangerous, to, health, causing, thousands, of, early, deaths, annually, in, the, us, alone, as, older, trucks, are, usually, the, worst, many, cities, have, banned, 20th, century, trucks, air, pollution, also, threatens, professional, truck, drivers, over, a, quarter, of, global, transport, co, 2, emissions, are, from, road, freight, in, 2021, over, 1700, million, tonnes, from, medium, and, heavy, trucks, so, many, countries, are, further, restricting, truck, co, 2, emissions, to, help, limit, climate, change, many, environmental, organizations, favor, laws, and, incentives, to, encourage, the, switch, from, road, to, rail, especially, in, europe, several, countries, have, pledged, that, 30, of, sales, of, trucks, and, buses, will, be, zero, emission, by, 2030, with, respect, to, noise, pollution, trucks, emit, considerably, higher, sound, levels, at, all, speeds, compared, to, typical, cars, this, contrast, is, particularly, strong, with, heavy, duty, trucks, there, are, several, aspects, of, truck, operations, that, contribute, to, the, overall, sound, that, is, emitted, continuous, sounds, are, those, from, tires, rolling, on, the, roadway, and, the, constant, hum, of, their, diesel, engines, at, highway, speeds, less, frequent, noises, but, perhaps, more, noticeable, are, things, like, the, repeated, sharp, pitched, whistle, of, a, turbocharger, on, acceleration, or, the, abrupt, blare, of, an, exhaust, brake, retarder, when, traversing, a, downgrade, there, has, been, noise, regulation, put, in, place, to, help, control, where, and, when, the, use, of, engine, braking, retarders, are, allowed, a, truck, cab, is, a, hazard, control, that, protects, the, truck, operator, from, hazardous, airborne, pollutants, as, an, enclosure, it, is, an, example, of, an, engineering, control, enclosed, operator, cabs, have, been, used, on, agriculture, mining, and, construction, vehicles, for, several, decades, most, modern, day, enclosed, cabs, have, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, systems, for, primarily, maintaining, a, comfortable, temperature, and, providing, breathable, air, for, their, occupants, various, levels, of, filtration, can, be, incorporated, into, the, hvac, system, to, remove, airborne, pollutants, such, as, dusts, diesel, particulate, matter, dpm, and, other, aerosols, two, key, elements, of, an, effective, environmental, enclosure, are, a, good, filtration, system, and, an, enclosure, with, good, integrity, sealed, isolation, from, the, outside, environment, it, is, recommended, that, a, filtration, system, filter, out, at, least, 95, or, greater, of, airborne, respirable, aerosols, from, the, intake, airflow, with, an, additional, recirculation, filtering, component, for, the, inside, air, good, enclosure, integrity, is, also, needed, to, achieve, positive, pressure, to, prevent, wind, driven, aerosol, penetration, into, the, enclosure, as, well, as, to, minimize, air, leakage, around, the, filtration, system, test, methods, and, mathematical, modeling, of, environmental, enclosures, are, also, beneficial, for, quantifying, and, optimizing, filtration, system, designs, as, well, as, maintaining, optimum, protection, factor, performance, for, enclosure, occupants, commercial, trucks, in, the, us, pay, higher, road, use, taxes, on, a, state, level, than, other, road, vehicles, and, are, subject, to, extensive, regulation, a, few, reasons, commercial, trucks, pay, higher, road, use, taxes, they, are, bigger, and, heavier, than, most, other, vehicles, and, cause, more, wear, and, tear, per, hour, on, roadways, and, trucks, and, their, drivers, are, on, the, road, for, more, hours, per, day, rules, on, use, taxes, differ, among, jurisdictions, the, life, of, a, pavement, is, measured, by, the, number, of, passes, of, a, vehicle, axle, it, may, be, evaluated, using, the, load, equivalency, factor, which, states, that, the, damage, by, the, pass, of, a, vehicle, axle, is, proportional, to, the, 4th, power, of, the, weight, so, a, ten, ton, axle, consumes, 10, 000, times, the, life, of, the, pavement, as, a, one, ton, axle, for, that, reason, loaded, trucks, cost, the, same, as, thousands, of, cars, in, pavement, costs, and, are, subject, to, higher, taxes, and, highway, tolls, in, 2002, and, 2004, there, were, over, 5, 000, fatalities, related, to, trucking, accidents, in, the, united, states, the, trucking, industry, has, since, made, significant, efforts, in, increasing, safety, regulations, in, 2008, the, industry, had, successfully, lowered, the, fatality, rate, to, just, over, 4, 000, deaths, but, trucking, accidents, are, still, an, issue, that, causes, thousands, of, deaths, and, injuries, each, year, approximately, 6, 000, trucking, accident, fatalities, occur, annually, in, the, united, states, fatalities, are, not, the, only, issue, caused, by, trucking, accidents, here, are, some, of, the, environmental, issues, that, arise, with, trucking, accidents, following, increased, pressure, from, the, times, cities, fit, for, cycling, campaign, and, from, other, media, in, spring, 2012, warning, signs, are, now, displayed, on, the, backs, of, many, heavy, goods, vehicles, hgv, these, signs, are, directed, against, a, common, type, of, accident, that, occurs, when, the, large, vehicle, turns, left, at, a, junction, a, cyclist, trying, to, pass, on, the, nearside, can, be, crushed, against, the, hgv, s, wheels, especially, if, the, driver, cannot, see, the, cyclist, the, signs, such, as, the, winning, design, of, the, intandem, road, safety, competition, launched, in, march, 2012, advocate, extra, care, when, passing, a, large, vehicle, on, the, nearside, in, vehicle, speed, limitation, is, required, applying, a, 90, km, h, limit, to, commercial, vehicles, over, 3, 5, tonnes, front, side, and, rear, underrun, protection, is, required, on, commercial, vehicles, over, 3, 5, tonnes, trucks, must, be, fitted, with, blind, spot, mirrors, that, give, drivers, a, wider, field, of, vision, than, conventional, mirrors
