a, fishing, vessel, is, a, boat, or, ship, used, to, catch, fish, and, other, valuable, nektonic, aquatic, animals, e, g, shrimps, prawns, krills, coleoids, etc, in, the, sea, lake, or, river, humans, have, used, different, kinds, of, surface, vessels, in, commercial, artisanal, and, recreational, fishing, prior, to, the, 1950s, there, was, little, standardisation, of, fishing, boats, designs, could, vary, between, localities, and, even, different, boatyards, traditional, fishing, boats, were, built, of, wood, which, is, not, often, used, nowadays, because, of, higher, maintenance, costs, and, lower, durability, fibreglass, is, used, increasingly, in, smaller, fishing, vessels, up, to, 25, metres, 100, tonne, displacement, while, steel, is, usually, used, on, vessels, above, 25, metres, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, number, of, recreational, fishing, boats, they, range, in, size, from, small, dinghies, sailboats, and, motorboats, to, large, superyachts, and, chartered, cruiseliners, unlike, commercial, fishing, vessels, recreational, fishing, vessels, are, often, more, for, leisurely, cruising, other, than, dedicated, just, to, fishing, early, fishing, vessels, included, rafts, dugout, canoes, and, boats, constructed, from, a, frame, covered, with, hide, or, tree, bark, along, the, lines, of, a, coracle, the, oldest, boats, found, by, archaeological, excavation, are, dugout, canoes, dating, back, to, the, neolithic, period, around, 7, 000, 9, 000, years, ago, these, canoes, were, often, cut, from, coniferous, tree, logs, using, simple, stone, tools, a, 7, 000, year, old, seagoing, boat, made, from, reeds, and, tar, has, been, found, in, kuwait, these, early, vessels, had, limited, capability, they, could, float, and, move, on, water, but, were, not, suitable, for, use, any, great, distance, from, the, shoreline, they, were, used, mainly, for, fishing, and, hunting, the, development, of, fishing, boats, took, place, in, parallel, with, the, development, of, boats, for, trade, and, war, early, navigators, began, to, use, animal, skins, or, woven, fabrics, for, sails, affixed, to, a, pole, set, upright, in, the, boat, these, sails, gave, early, boats, more, range, allowing, voyages, of, exploration, around, 4000, b, c, egyptians, were, building, long, narrow, boats, powered, by, many, oarsmen, over, the, next, 1, 000, years, they, made, a, series, of, remarkable, advances, in, boat, design, they, developed, cotton, made, sails, to, help, their, boats, go, faster, with, less, work, then, they, built, boats, large, enough, to, cross, the, oceans, these, boats, had, sails, and, oarsmen, and, were, used, for, travel, and, trade, by, 3000, bc, the, egyptians, knew, how, to, assemble, planks, of, wood, into, a, ship, hull, they, used, woven, straps, to, lash, planks, together, and, reeds, or, grass, stuffed, between, the, planks, to, seal, the, seams, an, example, of, their, skill, is, the, khufu, ship, a, vessel, 143, feet, 44, m, in, length, entombed, at, the, foot, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, around, 2, 500, bc, and, found, intact, in, 1954, at, about, the, same, time, the, scandinavians, were, also, building, innovative, boats, people, living, near, kongens, lyngby, in, denmark, came, up, with, the, idea, of, segregated, hull, compartments, which, allowed, the, size, of, boats, to, gradually, be, increased, a, crew, of, some, two, dozen, paddled, the, wooden, hjortspring, boat, across, the, baltic, sea, long, before, the, rise, of, the, roman, empire, scandinavians, continued, to, develop, better, ships, incorporating, iron, and, other, metal, into, the, design, and, developing, oars, for, propulsion, by, 1000, a, d, the, norsemen, were, pre, eminent, on, the, oceans, they, were, skilled, seamen, and, boat, builders, with, clinker, built, boat, designs, that, varied, according, to, the, type, of, boat, trading, boats, such, as, the, knarrs, were, wide, to, allow, large, cargo, storage, raiding, boats, such, as, the, longship, were, long, and, narrow, and, very, fast, the, vessels, they, used, for, fishing, were, scaled, down, versions, of, their, cargo, boats, the, scandinavian, innovations, influenced, fishing, boat, design, long, after, the, viking, period, came, to, an, end, for, example, yoles, from, the, orkney, island, of, stroma, were, built, in, the, same, way, as, the, norse, boats, in, the, 15th, century, the, dutch, developed, a, type, of, seagoing, herring, drifter, that, became, a, blueprint, for, european, fishing, boats, this, was, the, herring, buss, used, by, dutch, herring, fishermen, until, the, early, 19th, centuries, the, ship, type, buss, has, a, long, history, it, was, known, around, 1000, ad, in, scandinavia, as, a, b, za, a, robust, variant, of, the, viking, longship, the, first, herring, buss, was, probably, built, in, hoorn, around, 1415, the, ship, was, about, 20, metres, long, and, displaced, between, 60, and, 100, tons, it, was, a, massive, round, bilged, keel, ship, with, a, bluff, bow, and, stern, the, latter, relatively, high, and, with, a, gallery, the, busses, used, long, drifting, gill, nets, to, catch, the, herring, the, nets, would, be, retrieved, at, night, and, the, crews, of, eighteen, to, thirty, men, would, set, to, gibbing, salting, and, barrelling, the, catch, on, the, broad, deck, during, the, 17th, century, the, british, developed, the, dogger, an, early, type, of, sailing, trawler, or, longliner, which, commonly, operated, in, the, north, sea, doggers, were, slow, but, sturdy, capable, of, fishing, in, the, rough, conditions, of, the, north, sea, like, the, herring, buss, they, were, wide, beamed, and, bluff, bowed, but, considerably, smaller, about, 15, metres, long, a, maximum, beam, of, 4, 5, metres, a, draught, of, 1, 5, metres, and, displacing, about, 13, tonnes, they, could, carry, a, tonne, of, bait, three, tonnes, of, salt, half, a, tonne, each, of, food, and, firewood, for, the, crew, and, return, with, six, tonnes, of, fish, decked, areas, forward, and, aft, probably, provided, accommodation, storage, and, a, cooking, area, an, anchor, would, have, allowed, extended, periods, fishing, in, the, same, spot, in, waters, up, to, 18, metres, deep, the, dogger, would, also, have, carried, a, small, open, boat, for, maintaining, lines, and, rowing, ashore, a, precursor, to, the, dory, type, was, the, early, french, bateau, type, a, flat, bottom, boat, with, straight, sides, used, as, early, as, 1671, on, the, saint, lawrence, river, the, common, coastal, boat, of, the, time, was, the, wherry, and, the, merging, of, the, wherry, design, with, the, simplified, flat, bottom, of, the, bateau, resulted, in, the, birth, of, the, dory, england, france, italy, and, belgium, have, small, boats, from, medieval, periods, that, could, reasonably, be, construed, as, predecessors, of, the, dory, dories, appeared, in, new, england, fishing, towns, sometime, after, the, early, 18th, century, they, were, small, shallow, draft, boats, usually, about, five, to, seven, metres, 15, to, 22, feet, long, lightweight, and, versatile, with, high, sides, a, flat, bottom, and, sharp, bows, they, were, easy, and, cheap, to, build, the, banks, dories, appeared, in, the, 1830s, they, were, designed, to, be, carried, on, mother, ships, and, used, for, fishing, cod, at, the, grand, banks, adapted, almost, directly, from, the, low, freeboard, french, river, bateaus, with, their, straight, sides, and, removable, thwarts, bank, dories, could, be, nested, inside, each, other, and, stored, on, the, decks, of, fishing, schooners, such, as, the, gazela, primeiro, for, their, trip, to, the, grand, banks, fishing, grounds, the, portuguese, muletta, and, the, british, dogger, were, early, types, of, sailing, trawler, in, use, before, the, 17th, century, and, onward, but, the, modern, fishing, trawler, was, developed, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, early, 19th, century, the, fishermen, at, brixham, needed, to, expand, their, fishing, area, further, than, ever, before, due, to, the, ongoing, depletion, of, stocks, that, was, occurring, in, the, overfished, waters, of, south, devon, the, brixham, trawler, that, evolved, there, was, of, a, sleek, build, and, had, a, tall, gaff, rig, which, gave, the, vessel, sufficient, speed, to, make, long, distance, trips, out, to, the, fishing, grounds, in, the, ocean, they, were, also, sufficiently, robust, to, be, able, to, tow, large, trawls, in, deep, water, the, great, trawling, fleet, that, built, up, at, brixham, earned, the, village, the, title, of, mother, of, deep, sea, fisheries, this, revolutionary, design, made, large, scale, trawling, in, the, ocean, possible, for, the, first, time, resulting, in, a, massive, migration, of, fishermen, from, the, ports, in, the, south, of, england, to, villages, further, north, such, as, scarborough, hull, grimsby, harwich, and, yarmouth, that, were, points, of, access, to, the, large, fishing, grounds, in, the, atlantic, ocean, the, small, village, of, grimsby, grew, to, become, the, largest, fishing, port, in, the, world, by, the, mid, 19th, century, with, the, tremendous, expansion, in, the, fishing, industry, the, grimsby, dock, company, was, formed, in, 1846, the, dock, covered, 25, acres, 10, ha, and, was, formally, opened, by, queen, victoria, in, 1854, as, the, first, modern, fishing, port, the, facilities, incorporated, many, innovations, of, the, time, the, dock, gates, and, cranes, were, operated, by, hydraulic, power, and, the, 300, foot, 91, m, grimsby, dock, tower, was, built, to, provide, a, head, of, water, with, sufficient, pressure, by, william, armstrong, the, elegant, brixham, trawler, spread, across, the, world, influencing, fishing, fleets, everywhere, their, distinctive, sails, inspired, the, song, red, sails, in, the, sunset, written, aboard, a, brixham, sailing, trawler, called, the, torbay, lass, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, there, were, over, 3, 000, fishing, trawlers, in, commission, in, britain, with, almost, 1, 000, at, grimsby, these, trawlers, were, sold, to, fishermen, around, europe, including, from, the, netherlands, and, scandinavia, twelve, trawlers, went, on, to, form, the, nucleus, of, the, german, fishing, fleet, although, fishing, vessel, designed, increasingly, began, to, converge, around, the, world, local, conditions, still, often, led, the, development, of, different, types, of, fishing, boats, the, lancashire, nobby, was, used, down, the, north, west, coast, of, england, as, a, shrimp, trawler, from, 1840, until, world, war, ii, the, manx, nobby, was, used, around, the, isle, of, man, as, a, herring, drifter, the, fifie, was, also, used, as, a, herring, drifter, along, the, east, coast, of, scotland, from, the, 1850s, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, earliest, steam, powered, fishing, boats, first, appeared, in, the, 1870s, and, used, the, trawl, system, of, fishing, as, well, as, lines, and, drift, nets, these, were, large, boats, usually, 80, 90, feet, 24, 27, m, in, length, with, a, beam, of, around, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, they, weighed, 40, 50, tons, and, travelled, at, 9, 11, knots, 17, 20, km, h, 10, 13, mph, the, earliest, purpose, built, fishing, vessels, were, designed, and, made, by, david, allan, in, leith, in, march, 1875, when, he, converted, a, drifter, to, steam, power, in, 1877, he, built, the, first, screw, propelled, steam, trawler, in, the, world, this, vessel, was, pioneer, lh854, she, was, of, wooden, construction, with, two, masts, and, carried, a, gaff, rigged, main, and, mizen, using, booms, and, a, single, foresail, pioneer, is, mentioned, in, the, shetland, times, of, 4, may, 1877, in, 1878, he, completed, forward, and, onward, steam, powered, trawlers, for, sale, allan, built, a, total, of, ten, boats, at, leith, between, 1877, and, 1881, twenty, one, boats, were, completed, at, granton, his, last, vessel, being, degrave, in, 1886, most, of, these, were, sold, to, foreign, owners, in, france, belgium, spain, and, the, west, indies, the, first, steam, boats, were, made, of, wood, but, steel, hulls, were, soon, introduced, and, were, divided, into, watertight, compartments, they, were, well, designed, for, the, crew, with, a, large, building, that, contained, the, wheelhouse, and, the, deckhouse, the, boats, built, in, the, 20th, century, only, had, a, mizzen, sail, which, was, used, to, help, steady, the, boat, when, its, nets, were, out, the, main, function, of, the, mast, was, now, as, a, crane, for, lifting, the, catch, ashore, it, also, had, a, steam, capstan, on, the, foredeck, near, the, mast, for, hauling, nets, the, boats, had, narrow, high, funnels, so, that, the, steam, and, thick, coal, smoke, was, released, high, above, the, deck, and, away, from, the, fishermen, these, funnels, were, nicknamed, woodbines, because, they, looked, like, the, popular, brand, of, cigarette, these, boats, had, a, crew, of, twelve, made, up, of, a, skipper, driver, fireman, to, look, after, the, boiler, and, nine, deck, hands, steam, fishing, boats, had, many, advantages, they, were, usually, about, 20, ft, longer, 6, 1, m, than, the, sailing, vessels, so, they, could, carry, more, nets, and, catch, more, fish, this, was, important, as, the, market, was, growing, quickly, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, they, could, travel, faster, and, further, and, with, greater, freedom, from, weather, wind, and, tide, because, less, time, was, spent, travelling, to, and, from, the, fishing, grounds, more, time, could, be, spent, fishing, the, steam, boats, also, gained, the, highest, prices, for, their, fish, as, they, could, return, quickly, to, harbour, with, their, fresh, catch, the, main, disadvantage, of, the, steam, boats, though, was, their, high, operating, costs, their, engines, were, mechanically, inefficient, and, took, up, much, space, while, fuel, and, fitting, out, costs, were, very, high, before, the, first, world, war, building, costs, were, between, 3, 000, and, 4, 000, at, least, three, times, the, cost, of, the, sail, boats, to, cover, these, high, costs, they, needed, to, fish, for, longer, seasons, the, higher, expenses, meant, that, more, steam, drifters, were, company, owned, or, jointly, owned, as, the, herring, fishing, industry, declined, steam, boats, became, too, expensive, steam, trawlers, were, introduced, at, grimsby, and, hull, in, the, 1880s, in, 1890, it, was, estimated, that, there, were, 20, 000, men, on, the, north, sea, the, steam, drifter, was, not, used, in, the, herring, fishery, until, 1897, the, last, sailing, fishing, trawler, was, built, in, 1925, in, grimsby, trawler, designs, adapted, as, the, way, they, were, powered, changed, from, sail, to, coal, fired, steam, by, world, war, i, to, diesel, and, turbines, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, first, trawlers, fished, over, the, side, rather, than, over, the, stern, in, 1947, the, company, christian, salvesen, based, in, leith, scotland, refitted, a, surplus, algerine, class, minesweeper, hms, felicity, with, refrigeration, equipment, and, a, factory, ship, stern, ramp, to, produce, the, first, combined, freezer, stern, trawler, in, 1947, the, first, purpose, built, stern, trawler, was, fairtry, built, in, 1953, at, aberdeen, the, ship, was, much, larger, than, any, other, trawlers, then, in, operation, and, inaugurated, the, era, of, the, super, trawler, as, the, ship, pulled, its, nets, over, the, stern, it, could, lift, out, a, much, greater, haul, of, up, to, 60, tons, lord, nelson, followed, in, 1961, installed, with, vertical, plate, freezers, that, had, been, researched, and, built, at, the, torry, research, station, these, ships, served, as, a, basis, for, the, expansion, of, super, trawlers, around, the, world, in, the, following, decades, in, recent, decades, commercial, fishing, vessels, have, been, increasingly, equipped, with, electronic, aids, such, as, radio, navigation, aids, and, fish, finders, during, the, cold, war, some, countries, fitted, fishing, trawlers, with, additional, electronic, gear, so, they, could, be, used, as, spy, ships, to, monitor, the, activities, of, other, countries, about, 1, 3, million, of, these, are, decked, vessels, with, enclosed, areas, nearly, all, of, these, decked, vessels, are, mechanised, and, 40, 000, of, them, are, over, 100, tons, at, the, other, extreme, two, thirds, 1, 8, million, of, the, undecked, boats, are, traditional, craft, of, various, types, powered, only, by, sail, and, oars, these, boats, are, used, by, artisan, fishers, the, cape, town, agreement, is, an, international, international, maritime, organization, legal, instrument, established, in, 2012, that, sets, out, minimum, safety, requirements, for, fishing, vessels, of, 24, metres, in, length, and, over, or, equivalent, in, gross, tons, the, 200, mile, fishing, limit, has, changed, fishing, patterns, and, in, recent, times, fishing, boats, are, becoming, more, specialised, and, standardised, in, the, united, states, and, canada, more, use, is, made, of, large, factory, trawlers, while, the, huge, blue, water, fleets, operated, by, japan, and, the, soviet, bloc, countries, have, contracted, in, western, europe, fishing, vessel, design, is, focused, on, compact, boats, with, high, catching, power, commercial, fishing, is, a, high, risk, industry, and, countries, are, introducing, regulations, governing, the, construction, and, operation, of, fishing, vessels, the, international, maritime, organization, convened, in, 1959, by, the, united, nations, is, responsible, for, devising, measures, aimed, at, the, prevention, of, accidents, including, standards, for, ship, design, construction, equipment, operation, and, manning, according, to, the, fao, in, 2004, the, world, s, fishing, fleet, consisted, of, 4, million, vessels, of, these, 1, 3, million, were, decked, vessels, with, enclosed, areas, the, rest, were, open, vessels, of, which, two, thirds, were, traditional, craft, propelled, by, sails, and, oars, by, contrast, nearly, all, decked, vessels, were, mechanized, of, the, decked, vessels, 86, percent, are, found, in, asia, 7, 8, percent, in, europe, 3, 8, percent, in, north, and, central, america, 1, 3, percent, in, africa, 0, 6, percent, in, south, america, and, 0, 4, percent, in, oceania, most, commercial, fishing, boats, are, small, usually, less, than, 30, metres, 98, ft, but, up, to, 100, metres, 330, ft, for, a, large, purse, seiner, or, factory, ship, commercial, fishing, vessels, can, be, classified, by, architecture, the, type, of, fish, they, catch, the, fishing, method, used, or, geographical, origin, the, following, classification, follows, the, fao, who, classify, commercial, fishing, vessels, by, the, gear, they, use, a, trawler, is, a, fishing, vessel, designed, to, use, trawl, nets, in, order, to, catch, large, volumes, of, fish, seiners, use, surrounding, and, seine, nets, this, is, a, large, group, ranging, from, open, boats, as, small, as, 10, metres, 33, ft, in, length, to, ocean, going, vessels, there, are, also, specialised, gears, that, can, target, demersal, species, line, vessels, artisan, fishing, is, small, scale, commercial, or, subsistence, fishing, particularly, practices, involving, coastal, or, island, ethnic, groups, using, traditional, fishing, techniques, and, traditional, boats, this, may, also, include, heritage, groups, involved, in, customary, fishing, practices, according, to, the, fao, at, the, end, of, 2004, the, world, fishing, fleet, consisted, of, about, 4, million, vessels, of, which, 2, 7, million, were, undecked, open, boats, while, nearly, all, decked, vessels, were, mechanized, only, one, third, of, the, undecked, fishing, boats, were, powered, usually, with, outboard, engines, the, remaining, 1, 8, million, boats, were, traditional, craft, of, various, types, operated, by, sail, and, oars, these, figures, for, small, fishing, vessels, are, probably, under, reported, the, fao, compiles, these, figures, largely, from, national, registers, these, records, often, omit, smaller, boats, where, registration, is, not, required, or, where, fishing, licences, are, granted, by, provincial, or, municipal, authorities, artisan, fishing, boats, are, usually, small, traditional, fishing, boats, appropriately, designed, for, use, on, their, local, inland, waters, or, coasts, many, localities, around, the, world, have, developed, their, own, traditional, types, of, fishing, boats, adapted, to, use, local, materials, suitable, for, boat, building, and, to, the, specific, requirements, of, the, fisheries, and, sea, conditions, in, their, area, artisan, boats, are, often, open, undecked, many, have, sails, but, they, do, not, usually, use, much, or, any, mechanised, or, electronic, gear, large, numbers, of, artisan, fishing, boats, are, still, in, use, particularly, in, developing, countries, with, long, productive, marine, coastlines, for, example, indonesia, has, reported, about, 700, 000, fishing, boats, 25, percent, of, which, are, dugout, canoes, and, half, of, which, are, without, motors, the, philippines, have, reported, a, similar, number, of, small, fishing, boats, many, of, the, boats, in, this, area, are, double, outrigger, craft, consisting, of, a, narrow, main, hull, with, two, attached, outriggers, commonly, known, as, jukung, in, indonesia, and, banca, in, the, philippines, recreational, fishing, is, done, for, leisure, or, sport, and, not, for, profit, or, survival, just, about, anything, that, will, stay, afloat, can, be, called, a, recreational, fishing, boat, so, long, as, a, fisherman, periodically, climbs, aboard, with, the, intent, to, catch, fish, usually, some, form, of, fishing, tackle, is, brought, on, board, such, as, hooks, and, lines, rods, and, reels, sinkers, or, nets, and, occasionally, high, tech, devices, such, as, fishfinders, and, diving, drones, fish, are, caught, for, recreational, purposes, from, boats, that, range, from, dugout, canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon, boats, and, small, dinghies, to, runabouts, cabin, cruisers, and, yachts, to, large, high, tech, and, luxurious, big, game, boats, sometimes, fitted, with, outriggers, larger, boats, purpose, built, with, recreational, fishing, in, mind, usually, have, large, open, cockpits, at, the, stern, designed, for, convenient, fishing, big, game, fishing, started, as, a, sport, after, the, invention, of, the, motorized, boat, charles, frederick, holder, a, marine, biologist, and, early, conservationist, is, credited, with, founding, the, sport, in, 1898, purpose, built, game, fishing, boats, appeared, shortly, after, an, example, is, the, crete, in, use, at, catalina, island, california, in, 1915, and, shipped, to, hawaii, the, following, year, according, to, a, newspaper, report, at, that, time, the, crete, had, a, deep, cockpit, a, chair, fitted, for, landing, big, fish, and, leather, pockets, for, placing, the, pole, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, how, many, recreational, fishing, boats, there, are, although, the, number, is, high, the, term, is, fluid, since, most, recreational, boats, are, also, used, for, fishing, from, time, to, time, unlike, most, commercial, fishing, vessels, recreational, fishing, boats, are, often, not, dedicated, just, to, fishing, but, also, other, water, sports, such, as, water, skiing, parasailing, and, underwater, diving
