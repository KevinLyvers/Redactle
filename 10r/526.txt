https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_the_line
a, ship, of, the, line, was, a, type, of, naval, warship, constructed, during, the, age, of, sail, from, the, 17th, century, to, the, mid, 19th, century, the, ship, of, the, line, was, designed, for, the, naval, tactic, known, as, the, line, of, battle, which, involved, the, two, columns, of, opposing, warships, manoeuvering, to, volley, fire, with, the, cannons, along, their, broadsides, in, conflicts, where, opposing, ships, were, both, able, to, fire, from, their, broadsides, the, faction, with, more, cannons, firing, and, therefore, more, firepower, typically, had, an, advantage, from, the, end, of, the, 1840s, the, introduction, of, steam, power, brought, less, dependence, on, the, wind, in, battle, and, led, to, the, construction, of, screw, driven, wooden, hulled, ships, of, the, line, a, number, of, purely, sail, powered, ships, were, converted, to, this, propulsion, mechanism, however, the, rise, of, the, ironclad, frigate, starting, in, 1859, made, steam, assisted, ships, of, the, line, obsolete, the, ironclad, warship, became, the, ancestor, of, the, 20th, century, battleship, whose, very, designation, is, itself, a, contraction, of, the, phrase, ship, of, the, line, of, battle, or, more, colloquially, battleship, of, the, line, the, term, ship, of, the, line, fell, into, disuse, except, in, historical, contexts, after, warships, and, naval, tactics, evolved, and, changed, from, the, mid, 19th, century, some, other, languages, did, keep, the, name, however, the, imperial, german, navy, called, its, battleships, linienschiffe, until, world, war, i, the, heavily, armed, carrack, first, developed, in, portugal, for, either, trade, or, war, in, the, atlantic, ocean, was, the, precursor, of, the, ship, of, the, line, other, maritime, european, states, quickly, adopted, it, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, these, vessels, were, developed, by, fusing, aspects, of, the, cog, of, the, north, sea, and, galley, of, the, mediterranean, sea, the, cogs, which, traded, in, the, north, sea, in, the, baltic, sea, and, along, the, atlantic, coasts, had, an, advantage, over, galleys, in, battle, because, they, had, raised, platforms, called, castles, at, bow, and, stern, that, archers, could, occupy, to, fire, down, on, enemy, ships, or, even, to, drop, heavy, weights, from, at, the, bow, for, instance, the, castle, was, called, the, forecastle, usually, contracted, as, fo, c, sle, or, fo, c, s, le, and, pronounced, fohk, s, l, over, time, these, castles, became, higher, and, larger, and, eventually, were, built, into, the, structure, of, the, ship, increasing, overall, strength, this, aspect, of, the, cog, remained, in, the, newer, style, carrack, designs, and, proved, its, worth, in, battles, like, that, at, diu, in, 1509, the, mary, rose, was, an, early, 16th, century, english, carrack, or, great, ship, she, was, heavily, armed, with, 78, guns, and, 91, after, an, upgrade, in, the, 1530s, built, in, portsmouth, in, 1510, 1512, she, was, one, of, the, earliest, purpose, built, men, of, war, in, the, english, navy, she, was, over, 500, tons, burthen, and, had, a, keel, of, over, 32, metres, 105, ft, and, a, crew, of, over, 200, sailors, composed, of, 185, soldiers, and, 30, gunners, although, the, pride, of, the, english, fleet, she, accidentally, sank, during, the, battle, of, the, solent, 19, july, 1545, henri, gr, ce, dieu, english, henry, grace, of, god, nicknamed, great, harry, was, another, early, english, carrack, contemporary, with, mary, rose, henri, gr, ce, dieu, was, 50, metres, 160, ft, long, measuring, 1, 000, 1, 500, tons, burthen, and, having, a, complement, of, 700, 1, 000, she, was, ordered, by, henry, viii, in, response, to, the, scottish, ship, michael, launched, in, 1511, she, was, originally, built, at, woolwich, dockyard, from, 1512, to, 1514, and, was, one, of, the, first, vessels, to, feature, gunports, and, had, twenty, of, the, new, heavy, bronze, cannon, allowing, for, a, broadside, in, all, she, mounted, 43, heavy, guns, and, 141, light, guns, she, was, the, first, english, two, decker, and, when, launched, she, was, the, largest, and, most, powerful, warship, in, europe, but, she, saw, little, action, she, was, present, at, the, battle, of, the, solent, against, francis, i, of, france, in, 1545, in, which, mary, rose, sank, but, appears, to, have, been, more, of, a, diplomatic, vessel, sailing, on, occasion, with, sails, of, gold, cloth, indeed, the, great, ships, were, almost, as, well, known, for, their, ornamental, design, some, ships, like, the, vasa, were, gilded, on, their, stern, scrollwork, as, they, were, for, the, power, they, possessed, carracks, fitted, for, war, carried, large, calibre, guns, aboard, because, of, their, higher, freeboard, and, greater, load, bearing, ability, this, type, of, vessel, was, better, suited, than, the, galley, to, wield, gunpowder, weapons, because, of, their, development, for, conditions, in, the, atlantic, these, ships, were, more, weatherly, than, galleys, and, better, suited, to, open, waters, the, lack, of, oars, meant, that, large, crews, were, unnecessary, making, long, journeys, more, feasible, their, disadvantage, was, that, they, were, entirely, reliant, on, the, wind, for, mobility, galleys, could, still, overwhelm, great, ships, especially, when, there, was, little, wind, and, they, had, a, numerical, advantage, but, as, great, ships, increased, in, size, galleys, became, less, and, less, useful, another, detriment, was, the, high, forecastle, which, interfered, with, the, sailing, qualities, of, the, ship, the, bow, would, be, forced, low, into, the, water, while, sailing, before, the, wind, but, as, guns, were, introduced, and, gunfire, replaced, boarding, as, the, primary, means, of, naval, combat, during, the, 16th, century, the, medieval, forecastle, was, no, longer, needed, and, later, ships, such, as, the, galleon, had, only, a, low, one, deck, high, forecastle, by, the, time, of, the, 1637, launching, of, england, s, sovereign, of, the, seas, the, forecastle, had, disappeared, altogether, during, the, 16th, century, the, galleon, evolved, from, the, carrack, it, was, a, longer, and, more, manoeuvrable, type, of, ship, with, all, the, advantages, of, the, carrack, the, main, ships, of, the, english, and, spanish, fleets, in, the, battle, of, gravelines, of, 1588, were, galleons, all, of, the, english, and, most, of, the, spanish, galleons, survived, the, battle, and, the, following, storm, even, though, the, spanish, galleons, suffered, the, heaviest, attacks, from, the, english, while, regrouping, their, scattered, fleet, by, the, 17th, century, every, major, european, naval, power, was, building, ships, like, these, with, the, growing, importance, of, colonies, and, exploration, and, the, need, to, maintain, trade, routes, across, stormy, oceans, galleys, and, galleasses, a, larger, higher, type, of, galley, with, side, mounted, guns, but, lower, than, a, galleon, were, used, less, and, less, and, only, in, ever, more, restricted, purposes, and, areas, so, that, by, about, 1750, with, a, few, notable, exceptions, they, were, of, little, use, in, naval, battles, king, erik, xiv, of, sweden, initiated, construction, of, the, ship, mars, in, 1563, this, might, have, been, the, first, attempt, of, this, battle, tactic, roughly, 50, years, ahead, of, widespread, adoption, of, the, line, of, battle, strategy, mars, was, likely, the, largest, ship, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, her, build, equipped, with, 107, guns, at, a, full, length, of, 96, metres, 315, ft, ironically, it, became, the, first, ship, to, be, sunk, by, gunfire, from, other, ships, in, a, naval, battle, in, the, early, to, mid, 17th, century, several, navies, particularly, those, of, the, netherlands, and, england, began, to, use, new, fighting, techniques, previously, battles, had, usually, been, fought, by, great, fleets, of, ships, closing, with, each, other, and, fighting, in, whatever, arrangement, they, found, themselves, in, often, boarding, enemy, vessels, as, opportunities, presented, themselves, as, the, use, of, broadsides, coordinated, fire, by, the, battery, of, cannon, on, one, side, of, a, warship, became, increasingly, dominant, in, battle, tactics, changed, the, evolving, line, of, battle, tactic, first, used, in, an, ad, hoc, way, required, ships, to, form, single, file, lines, and, close, with, the, enemy, fleet, on, the, same, tack, battering, the, enemy, fleet, until, one, side, had, had, enough, and, retreated, any, manoeuvres, would, be, carried, out, with, the, ships, remaining, in, line, for, mutual, protection, in, order, that, this, order, of, battle, this, long, thin, line, of, guns, may, not, be, injured, or, broken, at, some, point, weaker, than, the, rest, there, is, at, the, same, time, felt, the, necessity, of, putting, in, it, only, ships, which, if, not, of, equal, force, have, at, least, equally, strong, sides, logically, it, follows, at, the, same, moment, in, which, the, line, ahead, became, definitively, the, order, for, battle, there, was, established, the, distinction, between, the, ships, of, the, line, alone, destined, for, a, place, therein, and, the, lighter, ships, meant, for, other, uses, the, lighter, ships, were, used, for, various, functions, including, acting, as, scouts, and, relaying, signals, between, the, flagship, and, the, rest, of, the, fleet, this, was, necessary, because, from, the, flagship, only, a, small, part, of, the, line, would, be, in, clear, sight, the, adoption, of, line, of, battle, tactics, had, consequences, for, ship, design, the, height, advantage, given, by, the, castles, fore, and, aft, was, reduced, now, that, hand, to, hand, combat, was, less, essential, the, need, to, manoeuvre, in, battle, made, the, top, weight, of, the, castles, more, of, a, disadvantage, so, they, shrank, making, the, ship, of, the, line, lighter, and, more, manoeuvrable, than, its, forebears, for, the, same, combat, power, as, an, added, consequence, the, hull, itself, grew, larger, allowing, the, size, and, number, of, guns, to, increase, as, well, in, the, 17th, century, fleets, could, consist, of, almost, a, hundred, ships, of, various, sizes, but, by, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, ship, of, the, line, design, had, settled, on, a, few, standard, types, older, two, deckers, i, e, with, two, complete, decks, of, guns, firing, through, side, ports, of, 50, guns, which, were, too, weak, for, the, battle, line, but, could, be, used, to, escort, convoys, two, deckers, of, between, 64, and, 90, guns, that, formed, the, main, part, of, the, fleet, and, larger, three, or, even, four, deckers, with, 98, to, 140, guns, that, served, as, admirals, command, ships, fleets, consisting, of, perhaps, 10, to, 25, of, these, ships, with, their, attendant, supply, ships, and, scouting, and, messenger, frigates, kept, control, of, the, sea, lanes, for, major, european, naval, powers, whilst, restricting, the, sea, borne, trade, of, enemies, the, most, common, size, of, sail, ship, of, the, line, was, the, 74, named, for, its, 74, guns, originally, developed, by, france, in, the, 1730s, and, later, adopted, by, all, battleship, navies, until, this, time, the, british, had, 6, sizes, of, ship, of, the, line, and, they, found, that, their, smaller, 50, and, 60, gun, ships, were, becoming, too, small, for, the, battle, line, while, their, 80s, and, over, were, three, deckers, and, therefore, unwieldy, and, unstable, in, heavy, seas, their, best, were, 70, gun, three, deckers, of, about, 46, metres, 151, ft, long, on, the, gundeck, while, the, new, french, 74s, were, around, 52, metres, 171, ft, in, 1747, the, british, captured, a, few, of, these, french, ships, during, the, war, of, austrian, succession, in, the, next, decade, thomas, slade, surveyor, of, the, navy, from, 1755, along, with, co, surveyor, william, bately, broke, away, from, the, past, and, designed, several, new, classes, of, 51, to, 52, metre, 167, to, 171, ft, 74s, to, compete, with, these, french, designs, starting, with, the, dublin, and, bellona, classes, their, successors, gradually, improved, handling, and, size, through, the, 1780s, other, navies, ended, up, building, 74s, also, as, they, had, the, right, balance, between, offensive, power, cost, and, manoeuvrability, eventually, around, half, of, britain, s, ships, of, the, line, were, 74s, larger, vessels, were, still, built, as, command, ships, but, they, were, more, useful, only, if, they, could, definitely, get, close, to, an, enemy, rather, than, in, a, battle, involving, chasing, or, manoeuvring, the, 74, remained, the, favoured, ship, until, 1811, when, seppings, s, method, of, construction, enabled, bigger, ships, to, be, built, with, more, stability, in, a, few, ships, the, design, was, altered, long, after, the, ship, was, launched, and, in, service, in, the, royal, navy, smaller, two, deck, 74, or, 64, gun, ships, of, the, line, that, could, not, be, used, safely, in, fleet, actions, had, their, upper, decks, removed, or, razeed, resulting, in, a, very, stout, single, gun, deck, warship, called, a, razee, the, resulting, razeed, ship, could, be, classed, as, a, frigate, and, was, still, much, stronger, the, most, successful, razeed, ship, in, the, royal, navy, was, hms, indefatigable, commanded, by, sir, edward, pellew, the, spanish, ship, nuestra, se, ora, de, la, sant, sima, trinidad, was, a, spanish, first, rate, ship, of, the, line, with, 112, guns, this, was, increased, in, 1795, 96, to, 130, guns, by, closing, in, the, spar, deck, between, the, quarterdeck, and, forecastle, and, around, 1802, to, 140, guns, thus, creating, what, was, in, effect, a, continuous, fourth, gundeck, although, the, extra, guns, added, were, actually, relatively, small, she, was, the, heaviest, armed, ship, in, the, world, when, rebuilt, and, bore, the, most, guns, of, any, ship, of, the, line, outfitted, in, the, age, of, sail, mahmudiye, 1829, ordered, by, the, ottoman, sultan, mahmud, ii, and, built, by, the, imperial, naval, arsenal, on, the, golden, horn, in, istanbul, was, for, many, years, the, largest, warship, in, the, world, the, 76, 15, m, 21, 22, m, 249, 8, ft, 69, 6, ft, ship, of, the, line, was, armed, with, 128, cannons, on, three, decks, and, was, manned, by, 1, 280, sailors, she, participated, in, the, siege, of, sevastopol, 1854, 1855, during, the, crimean, war, 1854, 1856, she, was, decommissioned, in, 1874, the, second, largest, sailing, three, decker, ship, of, the, line, ever, built, in, the, west, and, the, biggest, french, ship, of, the, line, was, the, valmy, launched, in, 1847, she, had, vertical, sides, which, increased, significantly, the, space, available, for, upper, batteries, but, reduced, the, stability, of, the, ship, wooden, stabilisers, were, added, under, the, waterline, to, address, the, issue, valmy, was, thought, to, be, the, largest, sort, of, sailing, ship, possible, as, larger, dimensions, made, the, manoeuvre, of, riggings, impractical, with, mere, manpower, she, participated, in, the, crimean, war, and, after, her, return, to, france, later, housed, the, french, naval, academy, under, the, name, borda, from, 1864, to, 1890, the, first, major, change, to, the, ship, of, the, line, concept, was, the, introduction, of, steam, power, as, an, auxiliary, propulsion, system, the, first, military, uses, of, steamships, came, in, the, 1810s, and, in, the, 1820s, a, number, of, navies, experimented, with, paddle, steamer, warships, their, use, spread, in, the, 1830s, with, paddle, steamer, warships, participating, in, conflicts, like, the, first, opium, war, alongside, ships, of, the, line, and, frigates, paddle, steamers, however, had, major, disadvantages, the, paddle, wheel, above, the, waterline, was, exposed, to, enemy, fire, while, itself, preventing, the, ship, from, firing, broadsides, effectively, during, the, 1840s, the, screw, propeller, emerged, as, the, most, likely, method, of, steam, propulsion, with, both, britain, and, the, us, launching, screw, propelled, warships, in, 1843, through, the, 1840s, the, british, and, french, navies, launched, ever, larger, and, more, powerful, screw, ships, alongside, sail, powered, ships, of, the, line, in, 1845, viscount, palmerston, gave, an, indication, of, the, role, of, the, new, steamships, in, tense, anglo, french, relations, describing, the, english, channel, as, a, steam, bridge, rather, than, a, barrier, to, french, invasion, it, was, partly, because, of, the, fear, of, war, with, france, that, the, royal, navy, converted, several, old, 74, gun, ships, of, the, line, into, 60, gun, steam, powered, blockships, following, the, model, of, fulton, s, demologos, starting, in, 1845, the, blockships, were, originally, conceived, as, steam, batteries, solely, for, harbour, defence, but, in, september, 1845, they, were, given, a, reduced, rig, rather, than, none, at, all, to, make, them, sea, going, ships, the, blockships, were, to, be, a, cost, effective, experiment, of, great, value, they, subsequently, gave, good, service, in, the, crimean, war, the, french, navy, however, developed, the, first, purpose, built, steam, battleship, with, the, 90, gun, napol, on, in, 1850, she, is, also, considered, the, first, true, steam, battleship, and, the, first, screw, battleship, ever, napol, on, was, armed, as, a, conventional, ship, of, the, line, but, her, steam, engines, could, give, her, a, speed, of, 12, knots, 22, km, h, 14, mph, regardless, of, the, wind, conditions, a, potentially, decisive, advantage, in, a, naval, engagement, eight, sister, ships, to, napol, on, were, built, in, france, over, a, period, of, ten, years, but, the, united, kingdom, soon, took, the, lead, in, production, in, number, of, both, purpose, built, and, converted, units, altogether, france, built, 10, new, wooden, steam, battleships, and, converted, 28, from, older, battleship, units, while, the, united, kingdom, built, 18, and, converted, 41, in, the, end, france, and, britain, were, the, only, two, countries, to, develop, fleets, of, wooden, steam, screw, battleships, although, several, other, navies, made, some, use, of, a, mixture, of, screw, battleships, and, paddle, steamer, frigates, these, included, russia, turkey, sweden, naples, prussia, denmark, and, austria, in, the, crimean, war, six, line, of, battle, ships, and, two, frigates, of, the, russian, black, sea, fleet, destroyed, seven, ottoman, frigates, and, three, corvettes, with, explosive, shells, at, the, battle, of, sinop, in, 1853, in, the, 1860s, unarmoured, steam, line, of, battle, ships, were, replaced, by, ironclad, warships, in, the, american, civil, war, on, march, 8, 1862, during, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, hampton, roads, two, unarmoured, union, wooden, frigates, were, sunk, and, destroyed, by, the, confederate, ironclad, css, virginia, however, the, power, implied, by, the, ship, of, the, line, would, find, its, way, into, the, ironclad, which, would, develop, during, the, next, few, decades, into, the, concept, of, the, battleship, several, navies, still, use, terms, equivalent, to, the, ship, of, the, line, for, battleships, including, the, german, linienschiff, and, russian, lineyniy, korabl, or, linkor, in, short, navies, in, the, north, sea, and, atlantic, ocean, the, fleets, of, the, royal, navy, the, netherlands, france, spain, and, portugal, fought, numerous, battles, in, the, baltic, the, scandinavian, kingdoms, and, russia, did, likewise, while, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, ottoman, empire, spain, france, britain, and, the, various, barbary, pirates, battled, by, the, eighteenth, century, the, uk, had, established, itself, as, the, world, s, preeminent, naval, power, attempts, by, napoleon, to, challenge, the, royal, navy, s, dominance, at, sea, proved, a, colossal, failure, during, the, napoleonic, wars, britain, defeated, french, and, allied, fleets, decisively, all, over, the, world, including, in, the, caribbean, at, the, battle, of, cape, st, vincent, the, bay, of, aboukir, off, the, egyptian, coast, at, the, battle, of, the, nile, in, 1798, near, spain, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, and, in, the, second, battle, of, copenhagen, 1807, the, uk, emerged, from, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1815, with, the, largest, and, most, professional, navy, in, the, world, composed, of, hundreds, of, wooden, sail, powered, ships, of, all, sizes, and, classes, overwhelming, firepower, was, of, no, use, if, it, could, not, be, brought, to, bear, which, was, not, always, possible, against, the, smaller, leaner, ships, used, by, napoleon, s, privateers, operating, from, french, new, world, territories, the, royal, navy, compensated, by, deploying, numerous, bermuda, sloops, similarly, many, of, the, east, india, company, s, merchant, vessels, became, lightly, armed, and, quite, competent, in, combat, during, this, period, operating, a, convoy, system, under, an, armed, merchantman, instead, of, depending, on, small, numbers, of, more, heavily, armed, ships, which, while, effective, slowed, the, flow, of, commerce, the, only, original, ship, of, the, line, remaining, today, is, hms, victory, preserved, as, a, museum, in, portsmouth, to, appear, as, she, was, while, under, admiral, horatio, nelson, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, although, victory, has, been, in, dry, dock, since, the, 1920s, she, is, still, a, fully, commissioned, warship, in, the, royal, navy, and, is, the, oldest, commissioned, warship, in, any, navy, worldwide, regalskeppet, vasa, sank, in, lake, m, laren, in, 1628, and, was, lost, until, 1956, she, was, then, raised, intact, in, remarkably, good, condition, in, 1961, and, is, presently, on, display, at, the, vasa, museum, in, stockholm, sweden, at, the, time, she, was, the, largest, swedish, warship, ever, built, today, the, vasa, museum, is, the, most, visited, museum, in, sweden, the, last, ship, of, the, line, afloat, was, the, french, ship, duguay, trouin, renamed, hms, implacable, after, being, captured, by, the, british, which, survived, until, 1949, the, last, ship, of, the, line, to, be, sunk, by, enemy, action, was, hms, wellesley, which, was, sunk, by, an, air, raid, in, 1940, during, the, second, world, war, she, was, briefly, re, floated, in, 1948, before, being, broken, up
