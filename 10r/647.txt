dyeing, is, the, application, of, dyes, or, pigments, on, textile, materials, such, as, fibers, yarns, and, fabrics, with, the, goal, of, achieving, color, with, desired, color, fastness, dyeing, is, normally, done, in, a, special, solution, containing, dyes, and, particular, chemical, material, dye, molecules, are, fixed, to, the, fiber, by, absorption, diffusion, or, bonding, with, temperature, and, time, being, key, controlling, factors, the, bond, between, the, dye, molecule, and, fiber, may, be, strong, or, weak, depending, on, the, dye, used, dyeing, and, printing, are, different, applications, in, printing, color, is, applied, to, a, localized, area, with, desired, patterns, in, dyeing, it, is, applied, to, the, entire, textile, the, primary, source, of, dye, historically, has, been, nature, with, the, dyes, being, extracted, from, plants, or, animals, since, the, mid, 19th, century, however, humans, have, produced, artificial, dyes, to, achieve, a, broader, range, of, colors, and, to, render, the, dyes, more, stable, for, washing, and, general, use, different, classes, of, dyes, are, used, for, different, types, of, fiber, and, at, different, stages, of, the, textile, production, process, from, loose, fibers, through, yarn, and, cloth, to, complete, garments, acrylic, fibers, are, dyed, with, basic, dyes, while, nylon, and, protein, fibers, such, as, wool, and, silk, are, dyed, with, acid, dyes, and, polyester, yarn, is, dyed, with, dispersed, dyes, cotton, is, dyed, with, a, range, of, dye, types, including, vat, dyes, and, modern, synthetic, reactive, and, direct, dyes, the, word, dye, d, a, die, comes, from, the, middle, english, deie, and, from, the, old, english, dag, and, dah, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, dye, was, before, the, 12th, century, the, earliest, dyed, flax, fibers, have, been, found, in, a, prehistoric, cave, in, the, georgia, and, dates, back, to, 34, 000, bc, more, evidence, of, textile, dyeing, dates, back, to, the, neolithic, period, at, the, large, neolithic, settlement, at, atalh, y, k, in, southern, anatolia, where, traces, of, red, dyes, possibly, from, ocher, an, iron, oxide, pigment, derived, from, clay, were, found, in, china, dyeing, with, plants, barks, and, insects, has, been, traced, back, more, than, 5, 000, years, 11, early, evidence, of, dyeing, comes, from, sindh, province, in, ancient, india, modern, day, pakistan, where, a, piece, of, cotton, dyed, with, a, vegetable, dye, was, recovered, from, the, archaeological, site, at, mohenjo, daro, 3rd, millennium, bce, the, dye, used, in, this, case, was, madder, which, along, with, other, dyes, such, as, indigo, was, introduced, to, other, regions, through, trade, natural, insect, dyes, such, as, cochineal, and, kermes, and, plant, based, dyes, such, as, woad, indigo, and, madder, were, important, elements, of, the, economies, of, asia, and, europe, until, the, discovery, of, man, made, synthetic, dyes, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, first, synthetic, dye, was, william, perkin, s, mauveine, in, 1856, derived, from, coal, tar, alizarin, the, red, dye, present, in, madder, was, the, first, natural, pigment, to, be, duplicated, synthetically, in, 1869, a, development, which, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, market, for, naturally, grown, madder, 65, the, development, of, new, strongly, colored, synthetic, dyes, followed, quickly, and, by, the, 1870s, commercial, dyeing, with, natural, dyestuffs, was, disappearing, an, important, characteristic, was, light, fastness, resistance, to, fading, when, exposed, to, sunlight, using, industrial, techniques, such, as, those, developed, by, james, morton, dyeing, can, be, applied, at, various, stages, within, the, textile, manufacturing, process, for, example, fibers, may, be, dyed, before, being, spun, into, yarns, and, yarns, may, be, dyed, before, being, woven, into, fabrics, fabrics, and, sometimes, finished, garments, themselves, may, also, be, dyed, the, stage, at, which, a, product, is, dyed, varies, depending, on, its, intended, end, use, the, cost, to, the, manufacturer, its, desired, appearance, and, the, resources, available, amongst, other, reasons, there, are, specific, terms, to, describe, these, dyeing, methods, such, as, there, are, various, terms, used, in, the, manufacturing, and, marketing, industries, depending, on, the, method, used, to, dye, the, substrate, for, example, stock, dyed, refers, to, dyeing, the, fibers, before, making, the, yarn, yarn, dyed, refers, to, dyeing, the, yarns, before, producing, fabrics, and, piece, dyed, or, fabric, dyed, refers, to, dyeing, the, yarns, after, they, are, converted, into, fabric, the, fastness, of, fiber, and, yarn, dyed, materials, is, superior, to, that, of, fabrics, the, primary, objective, of, the, dyeing, process, is, to, achieve, uniform, color, application, in, accordance, with, a, predetermined, color, matching, standard, or, reference, on, the, substrate, which, may, be, a, fiber, yarn, or, fabric, while, meeting, specified, colour, fastness, requirements, tie, dye, and, printing, are, the, methods, where, the, color, is, applied, in, a, localized, manner, in, the, exhaust, method, the, dye, is, transported, to, the, substrate, by, the, dye, liquor, s, motion, the, dye, is, adsorbed, onto, the, fibre, surface, and, ideally, diffuses, into, the, whole, of, the, fibre, water, consumption, in, exhaust, application, is, higher, than, the, continuous, dyeing, method, there, are, three, corresponding, ways, of, dyeing, with, the, exhaust, method, in, continuous, method, dye, is, transported, to, the, substrate, by, passing, it, through, the, different, stages, but, continuously, the, continuous, method, is, an, innovative, method, where, many, discrete, dyeing, stages, are, combined, such, as, applying, color, fixation, and, washing, off, of, unfixed, dyes, types, of, continuous, dyeing, are, as, follows, cold, pad, batch, method, is, a, semi, continuous, dyeing, process, waterless, dyeing, also, known, as, dry, dyeing, is, the, newly, developed, and, more, sustainable, dyeing, method, in, which, the, dyes, are, applied, to, the, substrate, with, the, help, of, carbon, dioxide, or, solutions, that, need, less, or, no, water, compared, to, their, counterparts, the, selection, of, the, appropriate, dyes, is, most, important, because, any, given, dye, does, not, apply, to, every, type, of, fiber, dyes, are, classified, according, to, many, parameters, such, as, chemical, structure, affinity, application, method, desired, colour, fastness, i, e, resistance, to, washing, rubbing, and, light, the, properties, may, vary, with, different, dyes, the, selection, of, dye, depends, on, the, objective, in, dyeing, and, affinity, to, which, material, is, to, be, dyed, fastness, of, color, largely, depends, upon, the, molecular, size, of, the, dyes, and, the, solubility, larger, molecular, size, serves, better, washing, fastness, results, indigo, dyes, have, a, poor, wash, and, rubbing, fastness, on, denim, cotton, so, they, are, used, to, produce, washed, down, effects, on, fabrics, in, contrast, vat, or, reactive, dyes, are, applied, to, cotton, to, achieve, excellent, washing, fastness, the, next, important, criterion, for, selecting, dyes, is, the, assessment, of, hazards, to, human, health, and, the, environment, there, are, many, dyes, especially, disperse, dyes, that, may, cause, allergic, reactions, to, some, individuals, and, the, negative, impact, on, the, environment, there, are, national, and, international, standards, and, regulations, which, need, to, comply, the, term, direct, dye, application, stems, from, some, dyestuff, having, to, be, either, fermented, as, in, the, case, of, some, natural, dye, or, chemically, reduced, as, in, the, case, of, synthetic, vat, and, sulfur, dyes, before, being, applied, this, renders, the, dye, soluble, so, that, it, can, be, absorbed, by, the, fiber, since, the, insoluble, dye, has, very, little, substantivity, to, the, fiber, direct, dyes, a, class, of, dyes, largely, for, dyeing, cotton, are, water, soluble, and, can, be, applied, directly, to, the, fiber, from, an, aqueous, solution, most, other, classes, of, synthetic, dye, other, than, vat, and, surface, dyes, are, also, applied, in, this, way, the, term, may, also, be, applied, to, dyeing, without, the, use, of, mordants, to, fix, the, dye, once, it, is, applied, mordants, were, often, required, to, alter, the, hue, and, intensity, of, natural, dyes, and, improve, color, fastness, chromium, salts, were, until, recently, extensively, used, in, dyeing, wool, with, synthetic, mordant, dyes, these, were, used, for, economical, high, color, fastness, dark, shades, such, as, black, and, navy, environmental, concerns, have, now, restricted, their, use, and, they, have, been, replaced, with, reactive, and, metal, complex, dyes, that, do, not, require, mordant, there, are, many, forms, of, yarn, dyeing, common, forms, are, the, package, form, and, the, hanks, form, cotton, yarns, are, mostly, dyed, at, package, form, and, acrylic, or, wool, yarn, are, dyed, at, hank, form, in, the, continuous, filament, industry, polyester, or, polyamide, yarns, are, always, dyed, at, package, form, while, viscose, rayon, yarns, are, partly, dyed, at, hank, form, because, of, technology, the, common, dyeing, process, of, cotton, yarn, with, reactive, dyes, at, package, form, is, as, follows, after, this, process, the, dyed, yarn, packages, are, packed, and, delivered, space, dyeing, is, a, technique, of, localized, color, application, that, produces, a, unique, multicolored, effect, garment, dyeing, is, the, process, of, dyeing, fully, fashioned, garments, subsequent, to, manufacturing, as, opposed, to, the, conventional, method, of, manufacturing, garments, from, pre, dyed, fabrics, up, until, the, mid, 1970s, the, method, was, rarely, used, for, commercial, clothing, production, it, was, used, domestically, to, overdye, old, worn, and, faded, clothes, and, also, by, resellers, of, used, or, surplus, military, clothing, the, first, notable, industrial, use, of, the, technique, was, made, by, benetton, which, garment, dyed, its, shetland, wool, knitwear, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, bologna, clothing, designer, massimo, osti, began, experimenting, with, the, garment, dyeing, technique, his, experimentation, over, the, next, decade, led, to, the, pioneering, of, not, just, the, industrial, use, of, traditional, garment, dyeing, dyeing, simple, cotton, or, wool, garments, but, more, importantly, the, technique, of, complex, garment, dyeing, which, involved, dyeing, fully, fashioned, garments, which, had, been, constructed, from, multiple, fabric, or, fiber, types, e, g, a, jacket, made, from, both, nylon, and, cotton, or, linen, nylon, and, polyurethane, coated, cotton, in, the, same, bath, up, until, its, development, by, osti, for, his, clothing, brand, c, p, company, this, technique, had, never, been, successfully, industrially, applied, in, any, context, the, complexity, lay, in, developing, both, a, practical, and, chemical, understanding, of, how, each, fabric, responded, differently, to, the, dye, how, much, it, would, shrink, how, much, color, it, would, absorb, developing, entirely, new, forms, of, quality, control, to, verify, possible, defects, in, fabric, before, dyeing, etc, beyond, the, industrial, advantages, of, the, technique, purchasing, fabric, in, one, color, white, or, natural, you, may, produce, as, many, colors, as, you, wish, etc, the, artistic, advantages, of, the, technique, were, considerable, and, in, many, ways, paved, the, way, for, the, creation, of, the, clothing, style, today, known, as, italian, sportswear, these, advantages, included, the, disadvantages, included, today, whilst, garment, dyeing, is, a, diffusely, employed, as, an, industrial, technique, around, the, globe, predominantly, in, the, production, of, vintage, style, cotton, garments, and, by, fast, fashion, suppliers, complex, garment, dyeing, is, still, practiced, almost, exclusively, in, italy, by, a, handful, of, premium, brands, and, suppliers, who, remain, committed, to, the, art, there, are, several, terms, associated, with, the, process, of, dyeing, affinity, refers, to, the, chemical, attraction, between, two, elements, or, substances, leading, to, their, inclination, to, unite, or, combine, as, observed, between, fiber, and, dyestuff, 4, materials, that, exhibit, bleeding, tendencies, may, lead, to, the, staining, of, white, or, light, colored, fabrics, in, contact, with, them, while, in, a, wet, state, the, phenomenon, of, color, fading, from, a, fabric, or, yarn, upon, immersion, in, water, solvent, or, a, comparable, liquid, medium, arises, due, to, inadequate, dyeing, or, the, utilization, of, inferior, quality, dyes, 16, fabric, can, experience, undesired, color, absorption, resulting, in, staining, when, exposed, to, water, dry, cleaning, solvent, or, similar, liquids, containing, unintended, dyestuffs, or, coloring, materials, additionally, direct, contact, with, other, dyed, materials, may, cause, color, transfer, through, bleeding, or, sublimation, 150, stripping, is, a, method, used, to, partially, or, entirely, remove, color, from, dyed, textile, materials, it, can, also, be, utilized, as, a, reprocessing, technique, to, correct, imperfect, dyeing
