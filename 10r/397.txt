a, hand, plane, is, a, tool, for, shaping, wood, using, muscle, power, to, force, the, cutting, blade, over, the, wood, surface, some, rotary, power, planers, are, motorized, power, tools, used, for, the, same, types, of, larger, tasks, but, are, unsuitable, for, fine, scale, planing, where, a, miniature, hand, plane, is, used, generally, all, planes, are, used, to, flatten, reduce, the, thickness, of, and, impart, a, smooth, surface, to, a, rough, piece, of, lumber, or, timber, planing, is, also, used, to, produce, horizontal, vertical, or, inclined, flat, surfaces, on, workpieces, usually, too, large, for, shaping, where, the, integrity, of, the, whole, requires, the, same, smooth, surface, special, types, of, planes, are, designed, to, cut, joints, or, decorative, mouldings, hand, planes, are, generally, the, combination, of, a, cutting, edge, such, as, a, sharpened, metal, plate, attached, to, a, firm, body, that, when, moved, over, a, wood, surface, take, up, relatively, uniform, shavings, by, nature, of, the, body, riding, on, the, high, spots, in, the, wood, and, also, by, providing, a, relatively, constant, angle, to, the, cutting, edge, render, the, planed, surface, very, smooth, a, cutter, that, extends, below, the, bottom, surface, or, sole, of, the, plane, slices, off, shavings, of, wood, a, large, flat, sole, on, a, plane, guides, the, cutter, to, remove, only, the, highest, parts, of, an, imperfect, surface, until, after, several, passes, the, surface, is, flat, and, smooth, when, used, for, flattening, bench, planes, with, longer, soles, are, preferred, for, boards, with, longer, longitudinal, dimensions, a, longer, sole, registers, against, a, greater, portion, of, the, board, s, face, or, edge, surface, which, leads, to, a, more, consistently, flat, surface, or, straighter, edge, conversely, using, a, smaller, plane, allows, for, more, localized, low, or, high, spots, to, remain, though, most, planes, are, pushed, across, a, piece, of, wood, holding, it, with, one, or, both, hands, japanese, planes, are, pulled, toward, the, body, not, pushed, away, woodworking, machinery, that, perform, a, similar, function, as, hand, planes, include, the, jointer, and, the, thickness, planer, also, called, a, thicknesser, the, job, these, specialty, power, tools, can, still, be, done, by, hand, planers, and, skilled, manual, labor, as, it, was, for, many, centuries, when, rough, lumber, is, reduced, to, dimensional, lumber, a, large, electric, motor, or, internal, combustion, engine, will, drive, a, thickness, planer, that, removes, a, certain, percentage, of, excess, wood, to, create, a, uniform, smooth, surface, on, all, four, sides, of, the, board, and, in, specialty, woods, may, also, plane, the, cut, edges, hand, planes, are, ancient, originating, thousands, of, years, ago, early, planes, were, made, from, wood, with, a, rectangular, slot, or, mortise, cut, across, the, center, of, the, body, the, cutting, blade, or, iron, was, held, in, place, with, a, wooden, wedge, the, wedge, was, tapped, into, the, mortise, and, adjusted, with, a, small, mallet, a, piece, of, scrap, wood, or, with, the, heel, of, the, user, s, hand, planes, of, this, type, have, been, found, in, excavations, of, old, sites, as, well, as, drawings, of, woodworking, from, medieval, europe, and, asia, the, earliest, known, examples, of, the, woodworking, plane, have, been, found, in, pompeii, although, other, roman, examples, have, been, unearthed, in, britain, and, germany, the, roman, planes, resemble, modern, planes, in, essential, function, most, having, iron, wrapping, a, wooden, core, top, bottom, front, and, rear, and, an, iron, blade, secured, with, a, wedge, one, example, found, in, cologne, has, a, body, made, entirely, of, bronze, without, a, wooden, core, a, roman, plane, iron, used, for, cutting, moldings, was, found, in, newstead, england, histories, prior, to, these, examples, are, not, clear, but, furniture, pieces, and, other, woodwork, found, in, egyptian, tombs, show, surfaces, carefully, smoothed, with, some, manner, of, cutting, edge, or, scraping, tool, there, are, suggestions, that, the, earliest, planes, were, simply, wooden, blocks, fastened, to, the, soles, of, adzes, to, effect, greater, control, of, the, cutting, action, in, the, mid, 1860s, leonard, bailey, began, producing, a, line, of, cast, iron, bodied, hand, planes, the, patents, for, which, were, later, purchased, by, stanley, rule, level, now, stanley, black, decker, the, original, bailey, designs, were, further, evolved, and, added, to, by, justus, traut, and, others, at, stanley, rule, level, the, bailey, and, bedrock, designs, became, the, basis, for, most, modern, metal, hand, plane, designs, manufactured, today, the, bailey, design, is, still, manufactured, by, stanley, black, decker, in, 1918, an, air, powered, handheld, planing, tool, was, developed, to, reduce, shipbuilding, labor, during, world, war, i, the, air, driven, cutter, spun, at, 8, 000, 15, 000, rpm, and, allowed, one, man, to, do, the, planing, work, of, up, to, fifteen, men, who, used, manual, tools, modern, hand, planes, are, made, from, wood, ductile, iron, or, bronze, which, produces, a, tool, that, is, heavier, and, will, not, rust, the, standard, components, of, a, hand, plane, include, most, planes, fall, within, the, categories, by, size, of, block, plane, smoothing, plane, and, jointing, plane, specialty, planes, include, the, shoulder, plane, router, plane, bullnose, plane, and, chisel, plane, among, others, electrically, powered, hand, planers, loosely, referred, to, as, power, planes, have, joined, the, hand, held, plane, family, bench, planes, are, characterized, by, having, their, cutting, bevel, facing, down, and, attached, to, a, chipbreaker, most, metal, bench, planes, as, well, as, some, larger, wooden, ones, are, designed, with, a, rear, handle, known, as, a, tote, block, planes, are, characterized, by, the, absence, of, a, chipbreaker, and, the, cutting, iron, bedded, with, the, bevel, up, the, block, plane, is, a, smaller, tool, that, can, be, held, with, one, hand, and, that, excels, at, working, across, the, grain, on, a, cut, end, of, a, board, end, grain, it, is, also, good, for, general, purpose, work, such, as, taking, down, a, knot, in, the, wood, smoothing, small, pieces, and, chamfering, edges, different, types, of, bench, planes, are, designed, to, perform, different, tasks, the, name, and, size, of, the, plane, being, defined, according, to, its, use, bailey, iron, bench, planes, were, designated, by, number, with, respect, to, the, length, of, the, plane, this, has, carried, over, through, the, type, regardless, of, manufacturer, a, no, 1, plane, is, but, little, more, than, five, inches, long, a, typical, smoothing, plane, approx, nine, inches, is, usually, a, no, 4, jack, planes, at, about, fourteen, inches, are, no, 5, an, eighteen, inch, fore, plane, will, be, a, no, 6, and, the, jointer, planes, at, twenty, two, to, twenty, four, inches, in, length, are, no, 7, or, 8, respectively, a, designation, such, as, no, 4, 1, 2, indicates, a, plane, of, no, 4, length, but, slightly, wider, a, designation, such, as, 5, 1, 2, indicates, the, length, of, a, no, 5, but, slightly, wider, actually, the, width, of, a, no, 6, or, a, no, 7, while, a, designation, such, as, 5, 1, 4, indicates, the, length, of, a, no, 5, but, slightly, narrower, actually, the, width, of, a, no, 3, bedrock, versions, of, the, above, are, simply, 600, added, to, the, base, number, although, no, 601, was, ever, produced, such, a, plane, is, indeed, available, from, specialist, dealers, 602, through, 608, including, all, the, fractionals, were, made, a, typical, order, of, use, in, flattening, truing, and, smoothing, a, rough, sawn, board, might, be, planes, may, also, be, classified, by, the, material, of, which, they, are, constructed, some, special, types, of, planes, include, planing, wood, along, its, side, grain, should, result, in, thin, shavings, rising, above, the, surface, of, the, wood, as, the, edge, of, the, plane, iron, is, pushed, forward, leaving, a, smooth, surface, but, sometimes, splintering, occurs, this, is, largely, a, matter, of, cutting, with, the, grain, or, against, the, grain, respectively, referring, to, the, side, grain, of, the, piece, of, wood, being, worked, the, grain, direction, can, be, determined, by, looking, at, the, edge, or, side, of, the, work, piece, wood, fibers, can, be, seen, running, out, to, the, surface, that, is, being, planed, when, the, fibers, meet, the, work, surface, it, looks, like, the, point, of, an, arrow, that, indicates, the, direction, with, some, very, figured, and, difficult, woods, the, grain, runs, in, many, directions, and, therefore, working, against, the, grain, is, inevitable, in, this, case, a, very, sharp, and, finely, set, blade, is, required, when, planing, against, the, grain, the, wood, fibers, are, lifted, by, the, plane, iron, resulting, in, a, jagged, finish, called, tearout, planing, across, the, grain, is, sometimes, called, traverse, or, transverse, planing, planing, the, end, grain, of, the, board, involves, different, techniques, and, frequently, different, planes, designed, for, working, end, grain, block, planes, and, other, bevel, up, planes, are, often, effective, in, planing, the, difficult, nature, of, end, grain, these, planes, are, usually, designed, to, use, an, iron, bedded, at, a, low, angle, typically, about, 12, degrees
