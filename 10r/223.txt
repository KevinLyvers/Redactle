a, sanitary, sewer, is, an, underground, pipe, or, tunnel, system, for, transporting, sewage, from, houses, and, commercial, buildings, but, not, stormwater, to, a, sewage, treatment, plant, or, disposal, sanitary, sewers, are, a, type, of, gravity, sewer, and, are, part, of, an, overall, system, called, a, sewage, system, or, sewerage, sanitary, sewers, serving, industrial, areas, may, also, carry, industrial, wastewater, in, municipalities, served, by, sanitary, sewers, separate, storm, drains, may, convey, surface, runoff, directly, to, surface, waters, an, advantage, of, sanitary, sewer, systems, is, that, they, avoid, combined, sewer, overflows, sanitary, sewers, are, typically, much, smaller, in, diameter, than, combined, sewers, which, also, transport, urban, runoff, backups, of, raw, sewage, can, occur, if, excessive, stormwater, inflow, or, groundwater, infiltration, occurs, due, to, leaking, joints, defective, pipes, etc, in, aging, infrastructure, sewage, treatment, is, less, effective, when, sanitary, waste, is, diluted, with, stormwater, and, combined, sewer, overflows, occur, when, runoff, from, heavy, rainfall, or, snowmelt, exceeds, the, hydraulic, capacity, of, sewage, treatment, plants, to, overcome, these, disadvantages, some, cities, built, separate, sanitary, sewers, to, collect, only, municipal, wastewater, and, exclude, stormwater, runoff, which, is, collected, in, separate, storm, drains, the, decision, to, build, a, combined, sewer, system, or, two, separate, systems, is, mainly, based, on, the, need, for, sewage, treatment, and, the, cost, of, providing, treatment, during, heavy, rain, events, many, cities, with, combined, sewer, systems, built, their, systems, prior, to, installing, sewage, treatment, plants, and, have, not, subsequently, replaced, those, sewer, systems, in, the, developed, world, sewers, are, pipes, from, buildings, to, one, or, more, levels, of, larger, underground, trunk, mains, which, transport, the, sewage, to, sewage, treatment, facilities, vertical, pipes, usually, made, of, precast, concrete, called, manholes, connect, the, mains, to, the, surface, depending, upon, site, application, and, use, these, vertical, pipes, can, be, cylindrical, eccentric, or, concentric, the, manholes, are, used, for, access, to, the, sewer, pipes, for, inspection, and, maintenance, and, as, a, means, to, vent, sewer, gases, they, also, facilitate, vertical, and, horizontal, angles, in, otherwise, straight, pipelines, pipes, conveying, sewage, from, an, individual, building, to, a, common, gravity, sewer, line, are, called, laterals, branch, sewers, typically, run, under, streets, receiving, laterals, from, buildings, along, that, street, and, discharge, by, gravity, into, trunk, sewers, at, manholes, larger, cities, may, have, sewers, called, interceptors, receiving, flow, from, multiple, trunk, sewers, design, and, sizing, of, sanitary, sewers, considers, the, population, to, be, served, over, the, anticipated, life, of, the, sewer, per, capita, wastewater, production, and, flow, peaking, from, timing, of, daily, routines, minimum, sewer, diameters, are, often, specified, to, prevent, blockage, by, solid, materials, flushed, down, toilets, gradients, may, be, selected, to, maintain, flow, velocities, generating, sufficient, turbulence, to, minimize, solids, deposition, within, the, sewer, commercial, and, industrial, wastewater, flows, are, also, considered, but, diversion, of, surface, runoff, to, storm, drains, eliminates, wet, weather, flow, peaks, of, inefficient, combined, sewers, a, force, main, or, rising, main, is, a, pumped, sewer, that, may, be, necessary, where, gravity, sewers, serve, areas, at, lower, elevations, than, the, sewage, treatment, plant, or, distant, areas, at, similar, elevations, a, lift, station, is, a, sewer, sump, that, lifts, accumulated, sewage, to, a, higher, elevation, they, may, also, be, used, to, prime, an, inverted, siphon, used, to, cross, underneath, rivers, or, other, obstructions, the, pump, may, discharge, to, another, gravity, sewer, or, directly, to, a, treatment, plant, force, mains, are, typically, constructed, of, welded, steel, or, hdpe, jointed, to, resist, pressures, within, the, pipe, force, mains, are, substantially, different, from, pressure, sewers, which, serve, individual, properties, or, groups, of, properties, and, provide, a, means, of, injecting, sewage, into, a, local, gravity, main, effluent, sewer, systems, also, called, septic, tank, effluent, drainage, sted, or, solids, free, sewer, sfs, systems, have, septic, tanks, that, collect, sewage, from, residences, and, businesses, and, the, effluent, that, comes, out, of, the, tank, is, sent, to, either, a, centralized, sewage, treatment, plant, or, a, distributed, treatment, system, for, further, treatment, most, of, the, solids, are, removed, by, the, septic, tanks, so, the, treatment, plant, can, be, much, smaller, than, a, typical, plant, in, addition, because, of, the, vast, reduction, in, solid, waste, a, pumping, system, rather, than, a, gravity, system, can, be, used, to, move, the, wastewater, the, pipes, have, small, diameters, typically, 1, 5, to, 4, inches, 4, to, 10, cm, because, the, waste, stream, is, pressurized, they, can, be, laid, just, below, the, ground, surface, along, the, land, s, contour, where, it, is, impossible, or, impractical, to, discharge, sewage, from, a, property, into, a, gravity, sanitary, sewer, a, pressure, sewer, may, provide, an, alternative, means, of, connection, a, macerator, pump, in, a, pumping, well, close, to, the, property, ejects, sewage, through, a, small, diameter, high, pressure, pipe, into, the, nearest, gravity, sewer, simplified, sanitary, sewers, consist, of, small, diameter, pipes, typically, around, 100, millimetres, 4, in, often, laid, at, fairly, flat, gradients, 1, in, 200, although, the, investment, cost, for, simplified, sanitary, sewers, can, be, about, half, the, cost, of, conventional, sewers, the, requirements, for, operation, and, maintenance, are, usually, higher, simplified, sewers, are, most, common, in, brazil, and, other, developing, countries, in, low, lying, communities, wastewater, is, often, conveyed, by, vacuum, sewer, pipelines, range, in, size, from, pipes, of, 125, millimetres, 4, 9, in, in, diameter, up, to, 280, millimetres, 11, in, in, diameter, vacuum, sewer, systems, use, differential, atmospheric, pressure, to, move, the, liquid, to, a, central, vacuum, station, sanitary, sewer, overflow, can, occur, due, to, blocked, or, broken, sewer, lines, infiltration, of, excessive, stormwater, or, malfunction, of, pumps, in, these, cases, untreated, sewage, is, discharged, from, a, sanitary, sewer, into, the, environment, prior, to, reaching, sewage, treatment, facilities, to, avoid, such, overflows, maintenance, is, required, blockage, prevention, campaigns, or, regulations, e, g, requiring, the, use, of, grease, interceptors, by, some, customers, may, also, be, necessary, the, maintenance, requirements, vary, with, the, type, of, sanitary, sewer, in, general, all, sewers, deteriorate, with, age, but, infiltration, and, inflow, are, problems, unique, to, sanitary, sewers, since, both, combined, sewers, and, storm, drains, are, sized, to, carry, these, contributions, holding, infiltration, to, acceptable, levels, requires, a, higher, standard, of, maintenance, than, necessary, for, structural, integrity, considerations, of, combined, sewers, a, comprehensive, construction, inspection, program, is, required, to, prevent, inappropriate, connection, of, cellar, yard, and, roof, drains, to, sanitary, sewers, the, probability, of, inappropriate, connections, is, higher, where, combined, sewers, and, sanitary, sewers, are, found, in, close, proximity, because, construction, personnel, may, not, recognize, the, difference, many, older, cities, still, use, combined, sewers, while, adjacent, suburbs, were, built, with, separate, sanitary, sewers, for, decades, when, sanitary, sewer, pipes, cracked, or, experienced, other, damage, the, only, option, was, an, expensive, excavation, removal, and, replacement, of, the, damaged, pipe, typically, requiring, street, repavement, afterwards, in, the, mid, 1950s, a, unit, was, invented, where, two, units, at, each, end, with, a, special, cement, mixture, in, between, was, pulled, from, one, manhole, cover, to, the, next, coating, the, pipe, with, the, cement, under, high, pressure, which, then, cured, rapidly, sealing, all, cracks, and, breaks, in, the, pipe, today, a, similar, method, using, epoxy, resin, is, used, by, some, municipalities, to, re, line, aging, or, damaged, pipes, effectively, creating, a, pipe, in, a, pipe, these, methods, may, be, unsuitable, for, locations, where, the, full, diameter, of, the, original, pipe, is, required, to, carry, expected, flows, and, may, be, an, unwise, investment, if, greater, wastewater, flows, may, be, anticipated, from, population, growth, increased, water, use, or, new, service, connections, within, the, expected, service, life, of, the, repair, another, popular, method, for, replacing, aged, or, damaged, lines, is, called, pipe, bursting, where, a, new, pipe, typically, pvc, or, abs, plastic, is, drawn, through, the, old, pipe, behind, an, expander, head, that, breaks, apart, the, old, pipe, as, the, new, one, is, drawn, through, behind, it, these, methods, are, most, suitable, for, trunk, sewers, since, repair, of, lines, with, lateral, connections, is, complicated, by, making, provisions, to, receive, lateral, flows, without, accepting, undesirable, infiltration, from, inadequately, sealed, junctions, some, sewers, have, tall, vent, pipes, to, release, foul, gases, well, up, away, from, people, common, names, for, these, pipes, are, stink, pipe, stink, pole, stench, pipe, and, sewer, ventilation, pipe, sanitary, sewers, evolved, from, combined, sewers, built, where, water, was, plentiful, animal, feces, accumulated, on, city, streets, while, animal, powered, transport, moved, people, and, goods, accumulations, of, animal, feces, encouraged, dumping, chamber, pots, into, streets, where, night, soil, collection, was, impractical, combined, sewers, were, built, to, use, surface, runoff, to, flush, waste, off, streets, and, move, it, underground, to, places, distant, from, populated, areas, sewage, treatment, became, necessary, as, population, expanded, but, increased, volumes, and, pumping, capacity, required, for, treatment, of, diluted, waste, from, combined, sewers, is, more, expensive, than, treating, undiluted, sewage, communities, that, have, urbanized, in, the, mid, 20th, century, or, later, generally, have, built, separate, systems, for, sewage, sanitary, sewers, and, stormwater, because, precipitation, causes, widely, varying, flows, reducing, sewage, treatment, plant, efficiency, in, the, uk, the, term, foul, sewer, was, also, in, use, for, a, sanitary, sewer
