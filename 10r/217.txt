https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination
desalination, is, a, process, that, removes, mineral, components, from, saline, water, more, generally, desalination, is, the, removal, of, salts, and, minerals, from, a, substance, one, example, is, soil, desalination, this, is, important, for, agriculture, it, is, possible, to, desalinate, saltwater, especially, sea, water, to, produce, water, for, human, consumption, or, irrigation, the, by, product, of, the, desalination, process, is, brine, many, seagoing, ships, and, submarines, use, desalination, modern, interest, in, desalination, mostly, focuses, on, cost, effective, provision, of, fresh, water, for, human, use, along, with, recycled, wastewater, it, is, one, of, the, few, water, resources, independent, of, rainfall, due, to, its, energy, consumption, desalinating, sea, water, is, generally, more, costly, than, fresh, water, from, surface, water, or, groundwater, water, recycling, and, water, conservation, however, these, alternatives, are, not, always, available, and, depletion, of, reserves, is, a, critical, problem, worldwide, desalination, processes, are, using, either, thermal, methods, in, the, case, of, distillation, or, membrane, based, methods, e, g, in, the, case, of, reverse, osmosis, energy, types, 24, an, estimate, in, 2018, found, that, 18, 426, desalination, plants, are, in, operation, in, over, 150, countries, they, produce, 87, million, cubic, meters, of, clean, water, each, day, and, supply, over, 300, million, people, 24, the, energy, intensity, has, improved, it, is, now, about, 3, kwh, m, 3, in, 2018, down, by, a, factor, of, 10, from, 20, 30, kwh, m, 3, in, 1970, 24, nevertheless, desalination, represented, about, 25, of, the, energy, consumed, by, the, water, sector, in, 2016, 24, ancient, greek, philosopher, aristotle, observed, in, his, work, meteorology, that, salt, water, when, it, turns, into, vapour, becomes, sweet, and, the, vapour, does, not, form, salt, water, again, when, it, condenses, and, that, a, fine, wax, vessel, would, hold, potable, water, after, being, submerged, long, enough, in, seawater, having, acted, as, a, membrane, to, filter, the, salt, at, the, same, time, the, desalination, of, seawater, was, recorded, in, china, both, the, classic, of, mountains, and, water, seas, in, the, period, of, the, warring, states, and, the, theory, of, the, same, year, in, the, eastern, han, dynasty, mentioned, that, people, found, that, the, bamboo, mats, used, for, steaming, rice, would, form, a, thin, outer, layer, after, long, use, the, as, formed, thin, film, had, adsorption, and, ion, exchange, functions, which, could, adsorb, salt, numerous, examples, of, experimentation, in, desalination, appeared, throughout, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, but, desalination, became, feasible, on, a, large, scale, only, in, the, modern, era, a, good, example, of, this, experimentation, comes, from, leonardo, da, vinci, florence, 1452, who, realized, that, distilled, water, could, be, made, cheaply, in, large, quantities, by, adapting, a, still, to, a, cookstove, during, the, middle, ages, elsewhere, in, central, europe, work, continued, on, distillation, refinements, although, not, necessarily, directed, towards, desalination, the, first, major, land, based, desalination, plant, may, have, been, installed, under, emergency, conditions, on, an, island, off, the, coast, of, tunisia, in, 1560, it, is, believed, that, a, garrison, of, 700, spanish, soldiers, was, besieged, by, the, turkish, army, and, that, during, the, siege, the, captain, in, charge, fabricated, a, still, capable, of, producing, 40, barrels, of, fresh, water, per, day, though, details, of, the, device, have, not, been, reported, before, the, industrial, revolution, desalination, was, primarily, of, concern, to, oceangoing, ships, which, otherwise, needed, to, keep, on, board, supplies, of, fresh, water, sir, richard, hawkins, 1562, 1622, who, made, extensive, travels, in, the, south, seas, reported, that, he, had, been, able, to, supply, his, men, with, fresh, water, by, means, of, shipboard, distillation, additionally, during, the, early, 1600s, several, prominent, figures, of, the, era, such, as, francis, bacon, and, walter, raleigh, published, reports, on, desalination, these, reports, and, others, set, the, climate, for, the, first, patent, dispute, concerning, desalination, apparatus, the, two, first, patents, regarding, water, desalination, were, approved, in, 1675, and, 1683, patents, no, 184, and, no, 226, published, by, william, walcot, and, robert, fitzgerald, and, others, respectively, nevertheless, neither, of, the, two, inventions, entered, service, as, a, consequence, of, scale, up, difficulties, no, significant, improvements, to, the, basic, seawater, distillation, process, were, made, during, the, 150, years, from, the, mid, 1600s, until, 1800, when, the, frigate, protector, was, sold, to, denmark, in, the, 1780s, as, the, ship, hussaren, its, still, was, studied, and, recorded, in, great, detail, in, the, united, states, thomas, jefferson, catalogued, heat, based, methods, going, back, to, the, 1500s, and, formulated, practical, advice, that, was, publicized, to, all, u, s, ships, on, the, reverse, side, of, sailing, clearance, permits, beginning, about, 1800, things, started, changing, as, a, consequence, of, the, appearance, of, the, steam, engine, and, the, so, called, age, of, steam, knowledge, of, the, thermodynamics, of, steam, processes, and, the, need, for, a, pure, water, source, for, its, use, in, boilers, generated, a, positive, effect, regarding, distilling, systems, additionally, the, spread, of, european, colonialism, induced, a, need, for, freshwater, in, remote, parts, of, the, world, thus, creating, the, appropriate, climate, for, water, desalination, in, parallel, with, the, development, and, improvement, of, systems, using, steam, multiple, effect, evaporators, these, type, of, devices, quickly, demonstrated, their, desalination, potential, in, 1852, alphonse, ren, le, mire, de, normandy, was, issued, a, british, patent, for, a, vertical, tube, seawater, distilling, unit, that, thanks, to, its, simplicity, of, design, and, ease, of, construction, gained, popularity, for, shipboard, use, land, based, units, did, not, significantly, appear, until, the, latter, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, the, 1860s, the, us, army, purchased, three, normandy, evaporators, each, rated, at, 7000, gallons, day, and, installed, them, on, the, islands, of, key, west, and, dry, tortugas, another, land, based, plant, was, installed, at, suakin, during, the, 1880s, that, provided, freshwater, to, the, british, troops, there, it, consisted, of, six, effect, distillers, with, a, capacity, of, 350, tons, day, after, world, war, ii, many, technologies, were, developed, or, improved, such, as, multi, effect, flash, desalination, mef, and, multi, stage, flash, desalination, msf, another, notable, technology, is, freeze, thaw, desalination, freeze, thaw, desalination, cryo, desalination, or, fd, excludes, dissolved, minerals, from, saline, water, through, crystallization, the, office, of, saline, water, was, created, in, the, united, states, department, of, the, interior, in, 1955, in, accordance, with, the, saline, water, conversion, act, of, 1952, this, act, was, motivated, by, a, water, shortage, in, california, and, inland, western, united, states, the, department, of, the, interior, allocated, resources, including, research, grants, expert, personnel, patent, data, and, land, for, experiments, to, further, advancements, the, results, of, these, efforts, included, the, construction, of, over, 200, electrodialysis, and, distillation, plants, globally, reverse, osmosis, ro, research, and, international, cooperation, for, example, the, first, international, water, desalination, symposium, and, exposition, in, 1965, the, office, of, saline, water, merged, into, the, office, of, water, resources, research, in, 1974, the, first, industrial, desalination, plant, in, the, united, states, opened, in, freeport, texas, in, 1961, after, a, decade, of, regional, drought, by, the, late, 1960s, and, the, early, 1970s, ro, started, to, show, promising, results, to, replace, traditional, thermal, desalination, units, research, took, place, at, state, universities, in, california, at, the, dow, chemical, company, and, dupont, many, studies, focus, on, ways, to, optimize, desalination, systems, the, first, commercial, ro, plant, the, coalinga, desalination, plant, was, inaugurated, in, california, in, 1965, for, brackish, water, dr, sidney, loeb, in, conjunction, with, staff, at, ucla, designed, a, large, pilot, plant, to, gather, data, on, ro, but, was, successful, enough, to, provide, freshwater, to, the, residents, of, coalinga, this, was, a, milestone, in, desalination, technology, as, it, proved, the, feasibility, of, ro, and, its, advantages, compared, to, existing, technologies, efficiency, no, phase, change, required, ambient, temperature, operation, scalability, and, ease, of, standardization, a, few, years, later, in, 1975, the, first, sea, water, reverse, osmosis, desalination, plant, came, into, operation, as, of, 2000, more, than, 2000, plants, were, operated, the, largest, are, in, saudi, arabia, israel, and, uae, and, the, biggest, plant, with, a, volume, of, 1, 401, 000, m3, d, is, in, saudi, arabia, ras, al, khair, as, of, 2021, 22, 000, plants, were, in, operation, in, 2024, the, catalan, government, installed, a, floating, offshore, plant, near, the, port, of, barcelona, and, purchased, 12, mobile, desalination, units, for, the, northern, region, of, the, costa, brava, to, combat, the, severe, drought, in, 2012, cost, averaged, 0, 75, per, cubic, meter, by, 2022, that, had, declined, before, inflation, to, 0, 41, desalinated, supplies, are, growing, at, a, 10, compound, rate, doubling, in, abundance, every, seven, years, there, are, now, about, 21, 000, desalination, plants, in, operation, around, the, globe, the, biggest, ones, are, in, the, united, arab, emirates, saudi, arabia, and, israel, the, world, s, largest, desalination, plant, is, located, in, saudi, arabia, ras, al, khair, power, and, desalination, plant, with, a, capacity, of, 1, 401, 000, cubic, meters, per, day, desalination, is, currently, expensive, compared, to, most, alternative, sources, of, water, and, only, a, very, small, fraction, of, total, human, use, is, satisfied, by, desalination, it, is, usually, only, economically, practical, for, high, valued, uses, such, as, household, and, industrial, uses, in, arid, areas, however, there, is, growth, in, desalination, for, agricultural, use, and, highly, populated, areas, such, as, singapore, or, california, the, most, extensive, use, is, in, the, persian, gulf, while, noting, costs, are, falling, and, generally, positive, about, the, technology, for, affluent, areas, in, proximity, to, oceans, a, 2005, study, argued, desalinated, water, may, be, a, solution, for, some, water, stress, regions, but, not, for, places, that, are, poor, deep, in, the, interior, of, a, continent, or, at, high, elevation, unfortunately, that, includes, some, of, the, places, with, the, biggest, water, problems, and, indeed, one, needs, to, lift, the, water, by, 2000, m, or, transport, it, over, more, than, 1600, km, to, get, transport, costs, equal, to, the, desalination, costs, thus, it, may, be, more, economical, to, transport, fresh, water, from, somewhere, else, than, to, desalinate, it, in, places, far, from, the, sea, like, new, delhi, or, in, high, places, like, mexico, city, transport, costs, could, match, desalination, costs, desalinated, water, is, also, expensive, in, places, that, are, both, somewhat, far, from, the, sea, and, somewhat, high, such, as, riyadh, and, harare, by, contrast, in, other, locations, transport, costs, are, much, less, such, as, beijing, bangkok, zaragoza, phoenix, and, of, course, coastal, cities, like, tripoli, after, desalination, at, jubail, saudi, arabia, water, is, pumped, 320, km, inland, to, riyadh, for, coastal, cities, desalination, is, increasingly, viewed, as, a, competitive, choice, in, 2023, israel, was, using, desalination, to, replenish, the, sea, of, galilee, s, water, supply, not, everyone, is, convinced, that, desalination, is, or, will, be, economically, viable, or, environmentally, sustainable, for, the, foreseeable, future, debbie, cook, wrote, in, 2011, that, desalination, plants, can, be, energy, intensive, and, costly, therefore, water, stressed, regions, might, do, better, to, focus, on, conservation, or, other, water, supply, solutions, than, invest, in, desalination, plants, desalination, is, an, artificial, process, by, which, saline, water, generally, sea, water, is, converted, to, fresh, water, the, most, common, desalination, processes, are, distillation, and, reverse, osmosis, there, are, several, methods, each, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, but, all, are, useful, the, methods, can, be, divided, into, membrane, based, e, g, reverse, osmosis, and, thermal, based, e, g, multistage, flash, distillation, methods, the, traditional, process, of, desalination, is, distillation, i, e, boiling, and, re, condensation, of, seawater, to, leave, salt, and, impurities, behind, there, are, currently, two, technologies, with, a, large, majority, of, the, world, s, desalination, capacity, multi, stage, flash, distillation, and, reverse, osmosis, solar, distillation, mimics, the, natural, water, cycle, in, which, the, sun, heats, sea, water, enough, for, evaporation, to, occur, after, evaporation, the, water, vapor, is, condensed, onto, a, cool, surface, there, are, two, types, of, solar, desalination, the, first, type, uses, photovoltaic, cells, to, convert, solar, energy, to, electrical, energy, to, power, desalination, the, second, type, converts, solar, energy, to, heat, and, is, known, as, solar, thermal, powered, desalination, water, can, evaporate, through, several, other, physical, effects, besides, solar, irradiation, these, effects, have, been, included, in, a, multidisciplinary, desalination, methodology, in, the, ibts, greenhouse, the, ibts, is, an, industrial, desalination, power, plant, on, one, side, and, a, greenhouse, operating, with, the, natural, water, cycle, scaled, down, 1, 10, on, the, other, side, the, various, processes, of, evaporation, and, condensation, are, hosted, in, low, tech, utilities, partly, underground, and, the, architectural, shape, of, the, building, itself, this, integrated, biotectural, system, is, most, suitable, for, large, scale, desert, greening, as, it, has, a, km, 2, footprint, for, the, water, distillation, and, the, same, for, landscape, transformation, in, desert, greening, respectively, the, regeneration, of, natural, fresh, water, cycles, in, vacuum, distillation, atmospheric, pressure, is, reduced, thus, lowering, the, temperature, required, to, evaporate, the, water, liquids, boil, when, the, vapor, pressure, equals, the, ambient, pressure, and, vapor, pressure, increases, with, temperature, effectively, liquids, boil, at, a, lower, temperature, when, the, ambient, atmospheric, pressure, is, less, than, usual, atmospheric, pressure, thus, because, of, the, reduced, pressure, low, temperature, waste, heat, from, electrical, power, generation, or, industrial, processes, can, be, employed, water, is, evaporated, and, separated, from, sea, water, through, multi, stage, flash, distillation, which, is, a, series, of, flash, evaporations, each, subsequent, flash, process, utilizes, energy, released, from, the, condensation, of, the, water, vapor, from, the, previous, step, multiple, effect, distillation, med, works, through, a, series, of, steps, called, effects, incoming, water, is, sprayed, onto, pipes, which, are, then, heated, to, generate, steam, the, steam, is, then, used, to, heat, the, next, batch, of, incoming, sea, water, to, increase, efficiency, the, steam, used, to, heat, the, sea, water, can, be, taken, from, nearby, power, plants, although, this, method, is, the, most, thermodynamically, efficient, among, methods, powered, by, heat, a, few, limitations, exist, such, as, a, max, temperature, and, max, number, of, effects, vapor, compression, evaporation, involves, using, either, a, mechanical, compressor, or, a, jet, stream, to, compress, the, vapor, present, above, the, liquid, the, compressed, vapor, is, then, used, to, provide, the, heat, needed, for, the, evaporation, of, the, rest, of, the, sea, water, since, this, system, only, requires, power, it, is, more, cost, effective, if, kept, at, a, small, scale, wave, powered, desalination, systems, generally, convert, mechanical, wave, motion, directly, to, hydraulic, power, for, reverse, osmosis, such, systems, aim, to, maximize, efficiency, and, reduce, costs, by, avoiding, conversion, to, electricity, minimizing, excess, pressurization, above, the, osmotic, pressure, and, innovating, on, hydraulic, and, wave, power, components, one, such, example, is, ceto, a, wave, power, technology, that, desalinates, seawater, using, submerged, buoys, wave, powered, desalination, plants, began, operating, on, garden, island, in, western, australia, in, 2013, and, in, perth, in, 2015, membrane, distillation, uses, a, temperature, difference, across, a, membrane, to, evaporate, vapor, from, a, brine, solution, and, condense, pure, water, on, the, colder, side, the, design, of, the, membrane, can, have, a, significant, effect, on, efficiency, and, durability, a, study, found, that, a, membrane, created, via, co, axial, electrospinning, of, pvdf, hfp, and, silica, aerogel, was, able, to, filter, 99, 99, of, salt, after, continuous, 30, day, usage, the, leading, process, for, desalination, in, terms, of, installed, capacity, and, yearly, growth, is, reverse, osmosis, ro, the, ro, membrane, processes, use, semipermeable, membranes, and, applied, pressure, on, the, membrane, feed, side, to, preferentially, induce, water, permeation, through, the, membrane, while, rejecting, salts, reverse, osmosis, plant, membrane, systems, typically, use, less, energy, than, thermal, desalination, processes, energy, cost, in, desalination, processes, varies, considerably, depending, on, water, salinity, plant, size, and, process, type, at, present, the, cost, of, seawater, desalination, for, example, is, higher, than, traditional, water, sources, but, it, is, expected, that, costs, will, continue, to, decrease, with, technology, improvements, that, include, but, are, not, limited, to, improved, efficiency, reduction, in, plant, footprint, improvements, to, plant, operation, and, optimization, more, effective, feed, pretreatment, and, lower, cost, energy, sources, reverse, osmosis, uses, a, thin, film, composite, membrane, which, comprises, an, ultra, thin, aromatic, polyamide, thin, film, this, polyamide, film, gives, the, membrane, its, transport, properties, whereas, the, remainder, of, the, thin, film, composite, membrane, provides, mechanical, support, the, polyamide, film, is, a, dense, void, free, polymer, with, a, high, surface, area, allowing, for, its, high, water, permeability, a, recent, study, has, found, that, the, water, permeability, is, primarily, governed, by, the, internal, nanoscale, mass, distribution, of, the, polyamide, active, layer, the, reverse, osmosis, process, requires, maintenance, various, factors, interfere, with, efficiency, ionic, contamination, calcium, magnesium, etc, dissolved, organic, carbon, doc, bacteria, viruses, colloids, and, insoluble, particulates, biofouling, and, scaling, in, extreme, cases, the, ro, membranes, are, destroyed, to, mitigate, damage, various, pretreatment, stages, are, introduced, anti, scaling, inhibitors, include, acids, and, other, agents, such, as, the, organic, polymers, polyacrylamide, and, polymaleic, acid, phosphonates, and, polyphosphates, inhibitors, for, fouling, are, biocides, as, oxidants, against, bacteria, and, viruses, such, as, chlorine, ozone, sodium, or, calcium, hypochlorite, at, regular, intervals, depending, on, the, membrane, contamination, fluctuating, seawater, conditions, or, when, prompted, by, monitoring, processes, the, membranes, need, to, be, cleaned, known, as, emergency, or, shock, flushing, flushing, is, done, with, inhibitors, in, a, fresh, water, solution, and, the, system, must, go, offline, this, procedure, is, environmentally, risky, since, contaminated, water, is, diverted, into, the, ocean, without, treatment, sensitive, marine, habitats, can, be, irreversibly, damaged, off, grid, solar, powered, desalination, units, use, solar, energy, to, fill, a, buffer, tank, on, a, hill, with, seawater, the, reverse, osmosis, process, receives, its, pressurized, seawater, feed, in, non, sunlight, hours, by, gravity, resulting, in, sustainable, drinking, water, production, without, the, need, for, fossil, fuels, an, electricity, grid, or, batteries, nano, tubes, are, also, used, for, the, same, function, i, e, reverse, osmosis, forward, osmosis, uses, a, semi, permeable, membrane, to, effect, separation, of, water, from, dissolved, solutes, the, driving, force, for, this, separation, is, an, osmotic, pressure, gradient, such, as, a, draw, solution, of, high, concentration, freeze, thaw, desalination, or, freezing, desalination, uses, freezing, to, remove, fresh, water, from, salt, water, salt, water, is, sprayed, during, freezing, conditions, into, a, pad, where, an, ice, pile, builds, up, when, seasonal, conditions, warm, naturally, desalinated, melt, water, is, recovered, this, technique, relies, on, extended, periods, of, natural, sub, freezing, conditions, a, different, freeze, thaw, method, not, weather, dependent, and, invented, by, alexander, zarchin, freezes, seawater, in, a, vacuum, under, vacuum, conditions, the, ice, desalinated, is, melted, and, diverted, for, collection, and, the, salt, is, collected, electrodialysis, utilizes, electric, potential, to, move, the, salts, through, pairs, of, charged, membranes, which, trap, salt, in, alternating, channels, several, variances, of, electrodialysis, exist, such, as, conventional, electrodialysis, electrodialysis, reversal, electrodialysis, can, simultaneously, remove, salt, and, carbonic, acid, from, seawater, preliminary, estimates, suggest, that, the, cost, of, such, carbon, removal, can, be, paid, for, in, large, part, if, not, entirely, from, the, sale, of, the, desalinated, water, produced, as, a, byproduct, microbial, desalination, cells, are, biological, electrochemical, systems, that, implements, the, use, of, electro, active, bacteria, to, power, desalination, of, water, in, situ, resourcing, the, natural, anode, and, cathode, gradient, of, the, electro, active, bacteria, and, thus, creating, an, internal, supercapacitor, the, desalination, process, s, energy, consumption, depends, on, the, water, s, salinity, brackish, water, desalination, requires, less, energy, than, seawater, desalination, the, energy, intensity, of, seawater, desalination, has, improved, it, is, now, about, 3, kwh, m, 3, in, 2018, down, by, a, factor, of, 10, from, 20, 30, kwh, m, 3, in, 1970, 24, this, is, similar, to, the, energy, consumption, of, other, freshwater, supplies, transported, over, large, distances, but, much, higher, than, local, fresh, water, supplies, that, use, 0, 2, kwh, m, 3, or, less, a, minimum, energy, consumption, for, seawater, desalination, of, around, 1, kwh, m, 3, has, been, determined, excluding, prefiltering, and, intake, outfall, pumping, under, 2, kwh, m, 3, has, been, achieved, with, reverse, osmosis, membrane, technology, leaving, limited, scope, for, further, energy, reductions, as, the, reverse, osmosis, energy, consumption, in, the, 1970s, was, 16, kwh, m, 3, supplying, all, us, domestic, water, by, desalination, would, increase, domestic, energy, consumption, by, around, 10, about, the, amount, of, energy, used, by, domestic, refrigerators, domestic, consumption, is, a, relatively, small, fraction, of, the, total, water, usage, note, electrical, equivalent, refers, to, the, amount, of, electrical, energy, that, could, be, generated, using, a, given, quantity, of, thermal, energy, and, an, appropriate, turbine, generator, these, calculations, do, not, include, the, energy, required, to, construct, or, refurbish, items, consumed, given, the, energy, intensive, nature, of, desalination, and, the, associated, economic, and, environmental, costs, desalination, is, generally, considered, a, last, resort, after, water, conservation, but, this, is, changing, as, prices, continue, to, fall, cogeneration, is, generating, excess, heat, and, electricity, generation, from, a, single, process, cogeneration, can, provide, usable, heat, for, desalination, in, an, integrated, or, dual, purpose, facility, where, a, power, plant, provides, the, energy, for, desalination, alternatively, the, facility, s, energy, production, may, be, dedicated, to, the, production, of, potable, water, a, stand, alone, facility, or, excess, energy, may, be, produced, and, incorporated, into, the, energy, grid, cogeneration, takes, various, forms, and, theoretically, any, form, of, energy, production, could, be, used, however, the, majority, of, current, and, planned, cogeneration, desalination, plants, use, either, fossil, fuels, or, nuclear, power, as, their, source, of, energy, most, plants, are, located, in, the, middle, east, or, north, africa, which, use, their, petroleum, resources, to, offset, limited, water, resources, the, advantage, of, dual, purpose, facilities, is, they, can, be, more, efficient, in, energy, consumption, thus, making, desalination, more, viable, the, current, trend, in, dual, purpose, facilities, is, hybrid, configurations, in, which, the, permeate, from, reverse, osmosis, desalination, is, mixed, with, distillate, from, thermal, desalination, basically, two, or, more, desalination, processes, are, combined, along, with, power, production, such, facilities, have, been, implemented, in, saudi, arabia, at, jeddah, and, yanbu, a, typical, supercarrier, in, the, us, military, is, capable, of, using, nuclear, power, to,

with, a, large, potential, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, water, use, practices, wastewater, reclamation, provides, multiple, benefits, over, desalination, of, saline, water, although, it, typically, uses, desalination, membranes, urban, runoff, and, storm, water, capture, also, provide, benefits, in, treating, restoring, and, recharging, groundwater, a, proposed, alternative, to, desalination, in, the, american, southwest, is, the, commercial, importation, of, bulk, water, from, water, rich, areas, either, by, oil, tankers, converted, to, water, carriers, or, pipelines, the, idea, is, politically, unpopular, in, canada, where, governments, imposed, trade, barriers, to, bulk, water, exports, as, a, result, of, a, north, american, free, trade, agreement, nafta, claim, the, california, department, of, water, resources, and, the, california, state, water, resources, control, board, submitted, a, report, to, the, state, legislature, recommending, that, urban, water, suppliers, achieve, an, indoor, water, use, efficiency, standard, of, 55, us, gallons, 210, litres, per, capita, per, day, by, 2023, declining, to, 47, us, gallons, 180, litres, per, day, by, 2025, and, 42, us, gallons, 160, litres, by, 2030, and, beyond, factors, that, determine, the, costs, for, desalination, include, capacity, and, type, of, facility, location, feed, water, labor, energy, financing, and, concentrate, disposal, costs, of, desalinating, sea, water, infrastructure, energy, and, maintenance, are, generally, higher, than, fresh, water, from, rivers, or, groundwater, water, recycling, and, water, conservation, but, alternatives, are, not, always, available, desalination, costs, in, 2013, ranged, from, us, 0, 45, to, us, 1, 00, m, 3, more, than, half, of, the, cost, comes, directly, from, energy, cost, and, since, energy, prices, are, very, volatile, actual, costs, can, vary, substantially, the, cost, of, untreated, fresh, water, in, the, developing, world, can, reach, us, 5, cubic, metre, desalination, stills, control, pressure, temperature, and, brine, concentrations, to, optimize, efficiency, nuclear, powered, desalination, might, be, economical, on, a, large, scale, in, 2014, the, israeli, facilities, of, hadera, palmahim, ashkelon, and, sorek, were, desalinizing, water, for, less, than, us, 0, 40, per, cubic, meter, as, of, 2006, singapore, was, desalinating, water, for, us, 0, 49, per, cubic, meter, in, the, united, states, cooling, water, intake, structures, are, regulated, by, the, environmental, protection, agency, epa, these, structures, can, have, the, same, impacts, on, the, environment, as, desalination, facility, intakes, according, to, epa, water, intake, structures, cause, adverse, environmental, impact, by, sucking, fish, and, shellfish, or, their, eggs, into, an, industrial, system, there, the, organisms, may, be, killed, or, injured, by, heat, physical, stress, or, chemicals, larger, organisms, may, be, killed, or, injured, when, they, become, trapped, against, screens, at, the, front, of, an, intake, structure, alternative, intake, types, that, mitigate, these, impacts, include, beach, wells, but, they, require, more, energy, and, higher, costs, the, kwinana, desalination, plant, opened, in, the, australian, city, of, perth, in, 2007, water, there, and, at, queensland, s, gold, coast, desalination, plant, and, sydney, s, kurnell, desalination, plant, is, withdrawn, at, 0, 1, m, s, 0, 33, ft, s, which, is, slow, enough, to, let, fish, escape, the, plant, provides, nearly, 140, 000, m, 3, 4, 900, 000, cu, ft, of, clean, water, per, day, desalination, processes, produce, large, quantities, of, brine, possibly, at, above, ambient, temperature, and, contain, residues, of, pretreatment, and, cleaning, chemicals, their, reaction, byproducts, and, heavy, metals, due, to, corrosion, especially, in, thermal, based, plants, chemical, pretreatment, and, cleaning, are, a, necessity, in, most, desalination, plants, which, typically, includes, prevention, of, biofouling, scaling, foaming, and, corrosion, in, thermal, plants, and, of, biofouling, suspended, solids, and, scale, deposits, in, membrane, plants, to, limit, the, environmental, impact, of, returning, the, brine, to, the, ocean, it, can, be, diluted, with, another, stream, of, water, entering, the, ocean, such, as, the, outfall, of, a, wastewater, treatment, or, power, plant, with, medium, to, large, power, plant, and, desalination, plants, the, power, plant, s, cooling, water, flow, is, likely, to, be, several, times, larger, than, that, of, the, desalination, plant, reducing, the, salinity, of, the, combination, another, method, to, dilute, the, brine, is, to, mix, it, via, a, diffuser, in, a, mixing, zone, for, example, once, a, pipeline, containing, the, brine, reaches, the, sea, floor, it, can, split, into, many, branches, each, releasing, brine, gradually, through, small, holes, along, its, length, mixing, can, be, combined, with, power, plant, or, wastewater, plant, dilution, furthermore, zero, liquid, discharge, systems, can, be, adopted, to, treat, brine, before, disposal, another, possibility, is, making, the, desalination, plant, movable, thus, avoiding, that, the, brine, builds, up, into, a, single, location, as, it, keeps, being, produced, by, the, desalination, plant, some, such, movable, ship, connected, desalination, plants, have, been, constructed, brine, is, denser, than, seawater, and, therefore, sinks, to, the, ocean, bottom, and, can, damage, the, ecosystem, brine, plumes, have, been, seen, to, diminish, over, time, to, a, diluted, concentration, to, where, there, was, little, to, no, effect, on, the, surrounding, environment, however, studies, have, shown, the, dilution, can, be, misleading, due, to, the, depth, at, which, it, occurred, if, the, dilution, was, observed, during, the, summer, season, there, is, possibility, that, there, could, have, been, a, seasonal, thermocline, event, that, could, have, prevented, the, concentrated, brine, to, sink, to, sea, floor, this, has, the, potential, to, not, disrupt, the, sea, floor, ecosystem, and, instead, the, waters, above, it, brine, dispersal, from, the, desalination, plants, has, been, seen, to, travel, several, kilometers, away, meaning, that, it, has, the, potential, to, cause, harm, to, ecosystems, far, away, from, the, plants, careful, reintroduction, with, appropriate, measures, and, environmental, studies, can, minimize, this, problem, the, energy, demand, for, desalination, in, the, middle, east, driven, by, severe, water, scarcity, is, expected, to, double, by, 2030, currently, this, process, primarily, uses, fossil, fuels, comprising, over, 95, of, its, energy, source, in, 2023, desalination, consumed, nearly, half, of, the, residential, sector, s, energy, in, the, region, due, to, the, nature, of, the, process, there, is, a, need, to, place, the, plants, on, approximately, 25, acres, of, land, on, or, near, the, shoreline, in, the, case, of, a, plant, built, inland, pipes, have, to, be, laid, into, the, ground, to, allow, for, easy, intake, and, outtake, however, once, the, pipes, are, laid, into, the, ground, they, have, a, possibility, of, leaking, into, and, contaminating, nearby, aquifers, aside, from, environmental, risks, the, noise, generated, by, certain, types, of, desalination, plants, can, be, loud, desalination, removes, iodine, from, water, and, could, increase, the, risk, of, iodine, deficiency, disorders, israeli, researchers, claimed, a, possible, link, between, seawater, desalination, and, iodine, deficiency, finding, iodine, deficits, among, adults, exposed, to, iodine, poor, water, concurrently, with, an, increasing, proportion, of, their, area, s, drinking, water, from, seawater, reverse, osmosis, swro, they, later, found, probable, iodine, deficiency, disorders, in, a, population, reliant, on, desalinated, seawater, a, possible, link, of, heavy, desalinated, water, use, and, national, iodine, deficiency, was, suggested, by, israeli, researchers, they, found, a, high, burden, of, iodine, deficiency, in, the, general, population, of, israel, 62, of, school, age, children, and, 85, of, pregnant, women, fall, below, the, who, s, adequacy, range, they, also, pointed, out, the, national, reliance, on, iodine, depleted, desalinated, water, the, absence, of, a, universal, salt, iodization, program, and, reports, of, increased, use, of, thyroid, medication, in, israel, as, a, possible, reasons, that, the, population, s, iodine, intake, is, low, in, the, year, that, the, survey, was, conducted, the, amount, of, water, produced, from, the, desalination, plants, constitutes, about, 50, of, the, quantity, of, fresh, water, supplied, for, all, needs, and, about, 80, of, the, water, supplied, for, domestic, and, industrial, needs, in, israel, other, desalination, techniques, include, thermally, driven, desalination, technologies, are, frequently, suggested, for, use, with, low, temperature, waste, heat, sources, as, the, low, temperatures, are, not, useful, for, process, heat, needed, in, many, industrial, processes, but, ideal, for, the, lower, temperatures, needed, for, desalination, in, fact, such, pairing, with, waste, heat, can, even, improve, electrical, process, diesel, generators, commonly, provide, electricity, in, remote, areas, about, 40, 50, of, the, energy, output, is, low, grade, heat, that, leaves, the, engine, via, the, exhaust, connecting, a, thermal, desalination, technology, such, as, membrane, distillation, system, to, the, diesel, engine, exhaust, repurposes, this, low, grade, heat, for, desalination, the, system, actively, cools, the, diesel, generator, improving, its, efficiency, and, increasing, its, electricity, output, this, results, in, an, energy, neutral, desalination, solution, an, example, plant, was, commissioned, by, dutch, company, aquaver, in, march, 2014, for, gulhi, maldives, originally, stemming, from, ocean, thermal, energy, conversion, research, low, temperature, thermal, desalination, lttd, takes, advantage, of, water, boiling, at, low, pressure, even, at, ambient, temperature, the, system, uses, pumps, to, create, a, low, pressure, low, temperature, environment, in, which, water, boils, at, a, temperature, gradient, of, 8, 10, c, 14, 18, f, between, two, volumes, of, water, cool, ocean, water, is, supplied, from, depths, of, up, to, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, this, water, is, pumped, through, coils, to, condense, the, water, vapor, the, resulting, condensate, is, purified, water, lttd, may, take, advantage, of, the, temperature, gradient, available, at, power, plants, where, large, quantities, of, warm, wastewater, are, discharged, from, the, plant, reducing, the, energy, input, needed, to, create, a, temperature, gradient, experiments, were, conducted, in, the, us, and, japan, to, test, the, approach, in, japan, a, spray, flash, evaporation, system, was, tested, by, saga, university, in, hawaii, the, national, energy, laboratory, tested, an, open, cycle, otec, plant, with, fresh, water, and, power, production, using, a, temperature, difference, of, 20, c, 36, f, between, surface, water, and, water, at, a, depth, of, around, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, lttd, was, studied, by,

announced, a, process, that, uses, solar, or, other, thermal, heat, to, drive, an, ionic, current, that, removes, all, sodium, and, chlorine, ions, from, the, water, using, ion, exchange, membranes, the, seawater, greenhouse, uses, natural, evaporation, and, condensation, processes, inside, a, greenhouse, powered, by, solar, energy, to, grow, crops, in, arid, coastal, land, in, 2022, using, a, technique, that, utilised, multiple, stages, of, ion, concentration, polarisation, followed, by, a, single, stage, of, electrodialysis, researchers, from, mit, manage, to, create, a, filterless, portable, desalination, unit, capable, of, removing, both, dissolved, salts, and, suspended, solids, designed, for, use, by, non, experts, in, remote, areas, or, natural, disasters, as, well, as, on, military, operations, the, prototype, is, the, size, of, a, suitcase, measuring, 42, 33, 5, 19, cm, 3, and, weighing, 9, 25, kg, the, process, is, fully, automated, notifying, the, user, when, the, water, is, safe, to, drink, and, can, be, controlled, by, a, single, button, or, smartphone, app, as, it, does, not, require, a, high, pressure, pump, the, process, is, highly, energy, efficient, consuming, only, 20, watt, hours, per, liter, of, drinking, water, produced, making, it, capable, of, being, powered, by, common, portable, solar, panels, using, a, filterless, design, at, low, pressures, or, replaceable, filters, significantly, reduces, maintenance, requirements, while, the, device, itself, is, self, cleaning, however, the, device, is, limited, to, producing, 0, 33, liters, of, drinking, water, per, minute, there, are, also, concerns, that, fouling, will, impact, the, long, term, reliability, especially, in, water, with, high, turbidity, the, researchers, are, working, to, increase, the, efficiency, and, production, rate, with, the, intent, to, commercialise, the, product, in, the, future, however, a, significant, limitation, is, the, reliance, on, expensive, materials, in, the, current, design, adsorption, based, desalination, ad, relies, on, the, moisture, absorption, properties, of, certain, materials, such, as, silica, gel, one, process, was, commercialized, by, modern, water, plc, using, forward, osmosis, with, a, number, of, plants, reported, to, be, in, operation, the, idea, of, the, method, is, in, the, fact, that, when, the, hydrogel, is, put, into, contact, with, aqueous, salt, solution, it, swells, absorbing, a, solution, with, the, ion, composition, different, from, the, original, one, this, solution, can, be, easily, squeezed, out, from, the, gel, by, means, of, sieve, or, microfiltration, membrane, the, compression, of, the, gel, in, closed, system, lead, to, change, in, salt, concentration, whereas, the, compression, in, open, system, while, the, gel, is, exchanging, ions, with, bulk, lead, to, the, change, in, the, number, of, ions, the, consequence, of, the, compression, and, swelling, in, open, and, closed, system, conditions, mimics, the, reverse, carnot, cycle, of, refrigerator, machine, the, only, difference, is, that, instead, of, heat, this, cycle, transfers, salt, ions, from, the, bulk, of, low, salinity, to, a, bulk, of, high, salinity, similarly, to, the, carnot, cycle, this, cycle, is, fully, reversible, so, can, in, principle, work, with, an, ideal, thermodynamic, efficiency, because, the, method, is, free, from, the, use, of, osmotic, membranes, it, can, compete, with, reverse, osmosis, method, in, addition, unlike, the, reverse, osmosis, the, approach, is, not, sensitive, to, the, quality, of, feed, water, and, its, seasonal, changes, and, allows, the, production, of, water, of, any, desired, concentration, the, united, states, france, and, the, united, arab, emirates, are, working, to, develop, practical, solar, desalination, aquadania, s, waterstillar, has, been, installed, at, dahab, egypt, and, in, playa, del, carmen, mexico, in, this, approach, a, solar, thermal, collector, measuring, two, square, metres, can, distill, from, 40, to, 60, litres, per, day, from, any, local, water, source, five, times, more, than, conventional, stills, it, eliminates, the, need, for, plastic, pet, bottles, or, energy, consuming, water, transport, in, central, california, a, startup, company, waterfx, is, developing, a, solar, powered, method, of, desalination, that, can, enable, the, use, of, local, water, including, runoff, water, that, can, be, treated, and, used, again, salty, groundwater, in, the, region, would, be, treated, to, become, freshwater, and, in, areas, near, the, ocean, seawater, could, be, treated, the, passarell, process, uses, reduced, atmospheric, pressure, rather, than, heat, to, drive, evaporative, desalination, the, pure, water, vapor, generated, by, distillation, is, then, compressed, and, condensed, using, an, advanced, compressor, the, compression, process, improves, distillation, efficiency, by, creating, the, reduced, pressure, in, the, evaporation, chamber, the, compressor, centrifuges, the, pure, water, vapor, after, it, is, drawn, through, a, demister, removing, residual, impurities, causing, it, to, compress, against, tubes, in, the, collection, chamber, the, compression, of, the, vapor, increases, its, temperature, the, heat, is, transferred, to, the, input, water, falling, in, the, tubes, vaporizing, the, water, in, the, tubes, water, vapor, condenses, on, the, outside, of, the, tubes, as, product, water, by, combining, several, physical, processes, passarell, enables, most, of, the, system, s, energy, to, be, recycled, through, its, evaporation, demisting, vapor, compression, condensation, and, water, movement, processes, geothermal, energy, can, drive, desalination, in, most, locations, geothermal, desalination, beats, using, scarce, groundwater, or, surface, water, environmentally, and, economically, nanotube, membranes, of, higher, permeability, than, current, generation, of, membranes, may, lead, to, eventual, reduction, in, the, footprint, of, ro, desalination, plants, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, use, of, such, membranes, will, lead, to, reduction, in, the, energy, needed, for, desalination, hermetic, sulphonated, nano, composite, membranes, have, shown, to, be, capable, of, removing, various, contaminants, to, the, parts, per, billion, level, and, have, little, or, no, susceptibility, to, high, salt, concentration, levels, biomimetic, membranes, are, another, approach, in, 2008, siemens, water, technologies, announced, technology, that, applied, electric, fields, to, desalinate, one, cubic, meter, of, water, while, using, only, a, purported, 1, 5, kwh, of, energy, if, accurate, this, process, would, consume, one, half, the, energy, of, other, processes, as, of, 2012, a, demonstration, plant, was, operating, in, singapore, researchers, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, and, the, university, of, marburg, are, developing, more, efficient, methods, of, electrochemically, mediated, seawater, desalination, a, process, employing, electrokinetic, shock, waves, can, be, used, to, accomplish, membraneless, desalination, at, ambient, temperature, and, pressure, in, this, process, anions, and, cations, in, salt, water, are, exchanged, for, carbonate, anions, and, calcium, cations, respectively, using, electrokinetic, shockwaves, calcium, and, carbonate, ions, react, to, form, calcium, carbonate, which, precipitates, leaving, fresh, water, the, theoretical, energy, efficiency, of, this, method, is, on, par, with, electrodialysis, and, reverse, osmosis, temperature, swing, solvent, extraction, tsse, uses, a, solvent, instead, of, a, membrane, or, high, temperatures, solvent, extraction, is, a, common, technique, in, chemical, engineering, it, can, be, activated, by, low, grade, heat, less, than, 70, c, 158, f, which, may, not, require, active, heating, in, a, study, tsse, removed, up, to, 98, 4, percent, of, the, salt, in, brine, a, solvent, whose, solubility, varies, with, temperature, is, added, to, saltwater, at, room, temperature, the, solvent, draws, water, molecules, away, from, the, salt, the, water, laden, solvent, is, then, heated, causing, the, solvent, to, release, the, now, salt, free, water, it, can, desalinate, extremely, salty, brine, up, to, seven, times, as, salty, as, the, ocean, for, comparison, the, current, methods, can, only, handle, brine, twice, as, salty, a, small, scale, offshore, system, uses, wave, energy, to, desalinate, 30, 50, m, 3, day, the, system,

one, of, the, world, s, largest, desalination, hubs, is, the, jebel, ali, power, generation, and, water, production, complex, in, the, united, arab, emirates, it, is, a, site, featuring, multiple, plants, using, different, desalination, technologies, and, is, capable, of, producing, 2, 2, million, cubic, meters, of, water, per, day, a, typical, aircraft, carrier, in, the, u, s, military, uses, nuclear, power, to, desalinize, 400, 000, us, gallons, 1, 500, 000, l, of, water, per, day, evaporation, of, water, over, the, oceans, in, the, water, cycle, is, a, natural, desalination, process, the, formation, of, sea, ice, produces, ice, with, little, salt, much, lower, than, in, seawater, seabirds, distill, seawater, using, countercurrent, exchange, in, a, gland, with, a, rete, mirabile, the, gland, secretes, highly, concentrated, brine, stored, near, the, nostrils, above, the, beak, the, bird, then, sneezes, the, brine, out, as, freshwater, is, not, usually, available, in, their, environments, some, seabirds, such, as, pelicans, petrels, albatrosses, gulls, and, terns, possess, this, gland, which, allows, them, to, drink, the, salty, water, from, their, environments, while, they, are, far, from, land, mangrove, trees, grow, in, seawater, they, secrete, salt, by, trapping, it, in, parts, of, the, root, which, are, then, eaten, by, animals, usually, crabs, additional, salt, is, removed, by, storing, it, in, leaves, that, fall, off, some, types, of, mangroves, have, glands, on, their, leaves, which, work, in, a, similar, way, to, the, seabird, desalination, gland, salt, is, extracted, to, the, leaf, exterior, as, small, crystals, which, then, fall, off, the, leaf, willow, trees, and, reeds, absorb, salt, and, other, contaminants, effectively, desalinating, the, water, this, is, used, in, artificial, constructed, wetlands, for, treating, sewage, despite, the, issues, associated, with, desalination, processes, public, support, for, its, development, can, be, very, high, one, survey, of, a, southern, california, community, saw, 71, 9, of, all, respondents, being, in, support, of, desalination, plant, development, in, their, community, in, many, cases, high, freshwater, scarcity, corresponds, to, higher, public, support, for, desalination, development, whereas, areas, with, low, water, scarcity, tend, to, have, less, public, support, for, its, development
