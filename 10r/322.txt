the, itaipu, dam, guarani, yjoko, itaipu, portuguese, barragem, de, itaipu, spanish, represa, de, itaip, is, a, hydroelectric, dam, on, the, paran, river, located, on, the, border, between, brazil, and, paraguay, it, is, the, third, largest, hydroelectric, dam, in, the, world, and, holds, the, 45th, largest, reservoir, in, the, world, the, name, itaipu, was, taken, from, an, isle, that, existed, near, the, construction, site, in, the, guarani, language, itaipu, means, the, sounding, stone, the, itaipu, dam, s, hydroelectric, power, plant, produced, the, second, most, electricity, of, any, in, the, world, as, of, 2020, only, surpassed, by, the, three, gorges, dam, plant, in, china, in, electricity, production, completed, in, 1984, it, is, a, binational, undertaking, run, by, brazil, and, paraguay, at, the, border, between, the, two, countries, 15, km, 9, 3, mi, north, of, the, friendship, bridge, the, project, ranges, from, foz, do, igua, u, in, brazil, and, ciudad, del, este, in, paraguay, in, the, south, to, gua, ra, and, salto, del, guair, in, the, north, the, installed, generation, capacity, of, the, plant, is, 14, gw, with, 20, generating, units, providing, 700, mw, each, with, a, hydraulic, design, head, of, 118, metres, 387, ft, in, 2016, the, plant, employed, 3038, workers, of, the, twenty, generator, units, currently, installed, ten, generate, at, 50, hz, for, paraguay, and, ten, generate, at, 60, hz, for, brazil, since, the, output, capacity, of, the, paraguayan, generators, far, exceeds, the, load, in, paraguay, most, of, their, production, is, exported, directly, to, the, brazilian, side, from, where, two, 600, kv, hvdc, lines, each, approximately, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, long, carry, the, majority, of, the, energy, to, the, s, o, paulo, rio, de, janeiro, region, where, the, terminal, equipment, converts, the, power, to, 60, hz, the, concept, behind, the, itaipu, power, plant, was, the, result, of, serious, negotiations, between, the, two, countries, during, the, 1960s, the, ata, do, igua, u, igua, u, act, was, signed, on, july, 22, 1966, by, the, brazilian, and, paraguayan, ministers, of, foreign, affairs, juracy, magalh, es, and, ra, l, sapena, pastor, this, was, a, joint, declaration, of, the, mutual, interest, in, studying, the, exploitation, of, the, hydro, resources, that, the, two, countries, shared, in, the, section, of, the, paran, river, starting, from, and, including, the, salto, de, sete, quedas, to, the, igua, u, river, watershed, the, treaty, that, gave, origin, to, the, power, plant, was, signed, in, 1973, the, terms, of, the, treaty, which, expires, in, 2023, have, been, the, subject, of, widespread, discontent, in, paraguay, the, government, of, president, lugo, vowed, to, renegotiate, the, terms, of, the, treaty, with, brazil, which, long, remained, hostile, to, any, renegotiation, in, 2009, brazil, agreed, to, a, fairer, payment, of, electricity, to, paraguay, and, also, allowed, paraguay, to, sell, excess, power, directly, to, brazilian, companies, instead, of, solely, through, the, brazilian, electricity, monopoly, in, 1970, the, consortium, formed, by, the, companies, elc, electroconsult, s, p, a, from, italy, and, ieco, from, the, united, states, won, the, international, competition, for, the, realization, of, the, viability, studies, and, for, the, elaboration, of, the, construction, project, design, studies, began, in, february, 1971, on, april, 26, 1973, brazil, and, paraguay, signed, the, itaipu, treaty, the, legal, instrument, for, the, hydroelectric, exploitation, of, the, paran, river, by, the, two, countries, on, may, 17, 1974, the, itaipu, binacional, entity, was, created, to, administer, the, plant, s, construction, the, construction, began, in, january, of, the, following, year, brazil, s, and, latin, america, s, first, electric, car, was, introduced, in, late, 1974, it, received, the, name, itaipu, in, honor, of, the, project, on, october, 14, 1978, the, paran, river, had, its, route, changed, which, allowed, a, section, of, the, riverbed, to, dry, so, the, dam, could, be, built, there, the, construction, of, the, dam, was, first, contested, by, argentina, but, the, negotiations, and, resolution, of, the, dispute, ended, up, setting, the, basis, for, argentine, brazilian, integration, later, on, an, important, diplomatic, settlement, was, reached, with, the, signing, of, the, acordo, tripartite, by, brazil, paraguay, and, argentina, on, october, 19, 1979, this, agreement, established, the, allowed, river, levels, and, how, much, they, could, change, as, a, result, of, the, various, hydroelectrical, undertakings, in, the, watershed, that, was, shared, by, the, three, countries, the, reservoir, began, its, formation, on, october, 13, 1982, when, the, dam, works, were, completed, and, the, side, canal, s, gates, were, closed, throughout, this, period, heavy, rains, and, flooding, accelerated, the, filling, of, the, reservoir, as, the, water, rose, 100, meters, 330, feet, and, reached, the, gates, of, the, spillway, on, october, 27, on, may, 5, 1984, the, first, generation, unit, started, running, in, itaipu, the, first, 18, units, were, installed, at, the, rate, of, two, to, three, a, year, the, last, two, of, these, started, running, in, the, year, 1991, the, last, two, of, the, 20, electric, generation, units, started, operations, in, september, 2006, and, in, march, 2007, thus, raising, the, installed, capacity, to, 14, gw, and, completing, the, power, plant, this, increase, in, capacity, allows, 18, generation, units, to, run, permanently, while, two, are, shut, down, for, maintenance, due, to, a, clause, in, the, treaty, signed, between, brazil, paraguay, and, argentina, the, maximum, number, of, generating, units, allowed, to, operate, simultaneously, cannot, exceed, 18, see, the, agreement, section, for, more, information, the, rated, nominal, power, of, each, generating, unit, turbine, and, generator, is, 700, mw, however, because, the, head, difference, between, reservoir, level, and, the, river, level, at, the, bottom, of, the, dam, that, actually, occurs, is, higher, than, the, designed, head, 118, m, or, 387, ft, the, power, available, exceeds, 750, mw, half, of, the, time, for, each, generator, each, turbine, generates, around, 700, mw, by, comparison, all, the, water, from, the, igua, u, falls, would, have, the, capacity, to, feed, only, two, generators, on, november, 10, 2009, transmission, from, the, plant, was, completely, disrupted, possibly, due, to, a, storm, damaging, up, to, three, high, voltage, transmission, lines, itaipu, itself, was, not, damaged, this, caused, massive, power, outages, in, brazil, and, paraguay, blacking, out, the, entire, country, of, paraguay, for, 15, minutes, and, plunging, rio, de, janeiro, and, s, o, paulo, into, darkness, for, more, than, 2, hours, 50, million, people, were, reportedly, affected, the, blackout, occurred, at, 22, 13, local, time, it, affected, the, southeast, of, brazil, most, severely, leaving, s, o, paulo, rio, de, janeiro, and, esp, rito, santo, completely, without, electricity, blackouts, also, swept, through, the, interior, of, rio, grande, do, sul, santa, catarina, mato, grosso, do, sul, mato, grosso, the, interior, of, bahia, and, parts, of, pernambuco, energy, officials, said, by, 00, 30, power, had, been, restored, to, most, areas, in, 1994, the, american, society, of, civil, engineers, elected, the, itaipu, dam, as, one, of, the, seven, modern, wonders, of, the, world, in, 1995, the, american, magazine, popular, mechanics, published, the, results, 325, metres, 1, 066, ft, entire, dam, including, the, 100, metres, 330, ft, high, power, line, 4, pylons, atop, the, barrage, 260, metres, 850, ft, dam, the, foundation, inside, water, until, the, river, floor, 247, metres, 810, ft, 196, metres, 643, ft, high, of, roof, reinforcement, concrete, dam, cranes, atop, the, barrage, 225, metres, 738, ft, elevation, end, main, concrete, barrage, when, construction, of, the, dam, began, approximately, 10, 000, families, living, beside, the, paran, river, were, displaced, because, of, construction, the, world, s, largest, waterfall, by, volume, the, gua, ra, falls, was, inundated, by, the, newly, formed, itaipu, reservoir, the, brazilian, government, later, liquidated, the, gua, ra, falls, national, park, a, few, months, before, the, reservoir, was, filled, 80, people, died, when, an, overcrowded, bridge, overlooking, the, falls, collapsed, as, tourists, sought, a, last, glimpse, of, the, falls, the, gua, ra, falls, was, an, effective, barrier, that, separated, freshwater, species, in, the, upper, paran, basin, with, its, many, endemics, from, species, found, below, it, and, the, two, are, recognized, as, different, ecoregions, after, the, falls, disappeared, many, species, formerly, restricted, to, one, of, these, areas, have, been, able, to, invade, the, other, causing, problems, typically, associated, with, introduced, species, for, example, more, than, 30, fish, species, that, formerly, were, restricted, to, the, region, below, the, falls, have, been, able, to, invade, the, region, above, the, american, composer, philip, glass, has, written, a, symphonic, cantata, named, itaipu, in, honour, of, the, structure, the, santa, maria, ecological, corridor, now, connects, the, igua, u, national, park, with, the, protected, margins, of, lake, itaipu, and, via, these, margins, with, the, ilha, grande, national, park, although, its, designed, peak, generating, capacity, is, only, 14, 000, mw, behind, the, 22, 500, mw, three, gorges, dam, the, dam, formerly, held, the, record, for, energy, production, with, 101, 6, twh, produced, in, 2016, this, record, was, beaten, in, 2020, when, the, three, gorges, dam, produced, a, new, record, 111, 8, twh, after, extensive, monsoon, rainfall, that, year, in, the, period, 2012, 2021, the, itaipu, dam, maintained, the, second, highest, average, annual, hydroelectric, production, in, the, world, averaging, 89, 22, twh, per, year, second, to, the, 97, 22, twh, per, year, average, of, the, three, gorges, dam, in, that, period
