engineering, is, the, practice, of, using, natural, science, mathematics, and, the, engineering, design, process, to, solve, technical, problems, increase, efficiency, and, productivity, and, improve, systems, modern, engineering, comprises, many, subfields, which, include, designing, and, improving, infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and, energy, systems, the, discipline, of, engineering, encompasses, a, broad, range, of, more, specialized, fields, of, engineering, each, with, a, more, specific, emphasis, on, particular, areas, of, applied, mathematics, applied, science, and, types, of, application, see, glossary, of, engineering, the, term, engineering, is, derived, from, the, latin, ingenium, meaning, cleverness, the, american, engineers, council, for, professional, development, ecpd, the, predecessor, of, abet, has, defined, engineering, as, the, creative, application, of, scientific, principles, to, design, or, develop, structures, machines, apparatus, or, manufacturing, processes, or, works, utilizing, them, singly, or, in, combination, or, to, construct, or, operate, the, same, with, full, cognizance, of, their, design, or, to, forecast, their, behavior, under, specific, operating, conditions, all, as, respects, an, intended, function, economics, of, operation, and, safety, to, life, and, property, engineering, has, existed, since, ancient, times, when, humans, devised, inventions, such, as, the, wedge, lever, wheel, and, pulley, etc, the, term, engineering, is, derived, from, the, word, engineer, which, itself, dates, back, to, the, 14th, century, when, an, engine, er, literally, one, who, builds, or, operates, a, siege, engine, referred, to, a, constructor, of, military, engines, in, this, context, now, obsolete, an, engine, referred, to, a, military, machine, i, e, a, mechanical, contraption, used, in, war, for, example, a, catapult, notable, examples, of, the, obsolete, usage, which, have, survived, to, the, present, day, are, military, engineering, corps, e, g, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, the, word, engine, itself, is, of, even, older, origin, ultimately, deriving, from, the, latin, ingenium, c, 1250, meaning, innate, quality, especially, mental, power, hence, a, clever, invention, later, as, the, design, of, civilian, structures, such, as, bridges, and, buildings, matured, as, a, technical, discipline, the, term, civil, engineering, entered, the, lexicon, as, a, way, to, distinguish, between, those, specializing, in, the, construction, of, such, non, military, projects, and, those, involved, in, the, discipline, of, military, engineering, the, pyramids, in, ancient, egypt, ziggurats, of, mesopotamia, the, acropolis, and, parthenon, in, greece, the, roman, aqueducts, via, appia, and, colosseum, teotihuac, n, and, the, brihadeeswarar, temple, of, thanjavur, among, many, others, stand, as, a, testament, to, the, ingenuity, and, skill, of, ancient, civil, and, military, engineers, other, monuments, no, longer, standing, such, as, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, and, the, pharos, of, alexandria, were, important, engineering, achievements, of, their, time, and, were, considered, among, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, the, six, classic, simple, machines, were, known, in, the, ancient, near, east, the, wedge, and, the, inclined, plane, ramp, were, known, since, prehistoric, times, the, wheel, along, with, the, wheel, and, axle, mechanism, was, invented, in, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, during, the, 5th, millennium, bc, the, lever, mechanism, first, appeared, around, 5, 000, years, ago, in, the, near, east, where, it, was, used, in, a, simple, balance, scale, and, to, move, large, objects, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, the, lever, was, also, used, in, the, shadoof, water, lifting, device, the, first, crane, machine, which, appeared, in, mesopotamia, c, 3000, bc, and, then, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, c, 2000, bc, the, earliest, evidence, of, pulleys, date, back, to, mesopotamia, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, and, ancient, egypt, during, the, twelfth, dynasty, 1991, 1802, bc, the, screw, the, last, of, the, simple, machines, to, be, invented, first, appeared, in, mesopotamia, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, 911, 609, bc, the, egyptian, pyramids, were, built, using, three, of, the, six, simple, machines, the, inclined, plane, the, wedge, and, the, lever, to, create, structures, like, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, the, earliest, civil, engineer, known, by, name, is, imhotep, as, one, of, the, officials, of, the, pharaoh, djos, r, he, probably, designed, and, supervised, the, construction, of, the, pyramid, of, djoser, the, step, pyramid, at, saqqara, in, egypt, around, 2630, 2611, bc, the, earliest, practical, water, powered, machines, the, water, wheel, and, watermill, first, appeared, in, the, persian, empire, in, what, are, now, iraq, and, iran, by, the, early, 4th, century, bc, kush, developed, the, sakia, during, the, 4th, century, bc, which, relied, on, animal, power, instead, of, human, energy, hafirs, were, developed, as, a, type, of, reservoir, in, kush, to, store, and, contain, water, as, well, as, boost, irrigation, sappers, were, employed, to, build, causeways, during, military, campaigns, kushite, ancestors, built, speos, during, the, bronze, age, between, 3700, and, 3250, bc, bloomeries, and, blast, furnaces, were, also, created, during, the, 7th, centuries, bc, in, kush, ancient, greece, developed, machines, in, both, civilian, and, military, domains, the, antikythera, mechanism, an, early, known, mechanical, analog, computer, and, the, mechanical, inventions, of, archimedes, are, examples, of, greek, mechanical, engineering, some, of, archimedes, inventions, as, well, as, the, antikythera, mechanism, required, sophisticated, knowledge, of, differential, gearing, or, epicyclic, gearing, two, key, principles, in, machine, theory, that, helped, design, the, gear, trains, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, are, widely, used, in, fields, such, as, robotics, and, automotive, engineering, ancient, chinese, greek, roman, and, hunnic, armies, employed, military, machines, and, inventions, such, as, artillery, which, was, developed, by, the, greeks, around, the, 4th, century, bc, the, trireme, the, ballista, and, the, catapult, in, the, middle, ages, the, trebuchet, was, developed, the, earliest, practical, wind, powered, machines, the, windmill, and, wind, pump, first, appeared, in, the, muslim, world, during, the, islamic, golden, age, in, what, are, now, iran, afghanistan, and, pakistan, by, the, 9th, century, ad, the, earliest, practical, steam, powered, machine, was, a, steam, jack, driven, by, a, steam, turbine, described, in, 1551, by, taqi, al, din, muhammad, ibn, ma, ruf, in, ottoman, egypt, the, cotton, gin, was, invented, in, india, by, the, 6th, century, ad, and, the, spinning, wheel, was, invented, in, the, islamic, world, by, the, early, 11th, century, both, of, which, were, fundamental, to, the, growth, of, the, cotton, industry, the, spinning, wheel, was, also, a, precursor, to, the, spinning, jenny, which, was, a, key, development, during, the, early, industrial, revolution, in, the, 18th, century, the, earliest, programmable, machines, were, developed, in, the, muslim, world, a, music, sequencer, a, programmable, musical, instrument, was, the, earliest, type, of, programmable, machine, the, first, music, sequencer, was, an, automated, flute, player, invented, by, the, banu, musa, brothers, described, in, their, book, of, ingenious, devices, in, the, 9th, century, in, 1206, al, jazari, invented, programmable, automata, robots, he, described, four, automaton, musicians, including, drummers, operated, by, a, programmable, drum, machine, where, they, could, be, made, to, play, different, rhythms, and, different, drum, patterns, before, the, development, of, modern, engineering, mathematics, was, used, by, artisans, and, craftsmen, such, as, millwrights, clockmakers, instrument, makers, and, surveyors, aside, from, these, professions, universities, were, not, believed, to, have, had, much, practical, significance, to, technology, 32, a, standard, reference, for, the, state, of, mechanical, arts, during, the, renaissance, is, given, in, the, mining, engineering, treatise, de, re, metallica, 1556, which, also, contains, sections, on, geology, mining, and, chemistry, de, re, metallica, was, the, standard, chemistry, reference, for, the, next, 180, years, the, science, of, classical, mechanics, sometimes, called, newtonian, mechanics, formed, the, scientific, basis, of, much, of, modern, engineering, with, the, rise, of, engineering, as, a, profession, in, the, 18th, century, the, term, became, more, narrowly, applied, to, fields, in, which, mathematics, and, science, were, applied, to, these, ends, similarly, in, addition, to, military, and, civil, engineering, the, fields, then, known, as, the, mechanic, arts, became, incorporated, into, engineering, canal, building, was, an, important, engineering, work, during, the, early, phases, of, the, industrial, revolution, john, smeaton, was, the, first, self, proclaimed, civil, engineer, and, is, often, regarded, as, the, father, of, civil, engineering, he, was, an, english, civil, engineer, responsible, for, the, design, of, bridges, canals, harbors, and, lighthouses, he, was, also, a, capable, mechanical, engineer, and, an, eminent, physicist, using, a, model, water, wheel, smeaton, conducted, experiments, for, seven, years, determining, ways, to, increase, efficiency, 127, smeaton, introduced, iron, axles, and, gears, to, water, wheels, 69, smeaton, also, made, mechanical, improvements, to, the, newcomen, steam, engine, smeaton, designed, the, third, eddystone, lighthouse, 1755, 59, where, he, pioneered, the, use, of, hydraulic, lime, a, form, of, mortar, which, will, set, under, water, and, developed, a, technique, involving, dovetailed, blocks, of, granite, in, the, building, of, the, lighthouse, he, is, important, in, the, history, rediscovery, of, and, development, of, modern, cement, because, he, identified, the, compositional, requirements, needed, to, obtain, hydraulicity, in, lime, work, which, led, ultimately, to, the, invention, of, portland, cement, applied, science, led, to, the, development, of, the, steam, engine, the, sequence, of, events, began, with, the, invention, of, the, barometer, and, the, measurement, of, atmospheric, pressure, by, evangelista, torricelli, in, 1643, demonstration, of, the, force, of, atmospheric, pressure, by, otto, von, guericke, using, the, magdeburg, hemispheres, in, 1656, laboratory, experiments, by, denis, papin, who, built, experimental, model, steam, engines, and, demonstrated, the, use, of, a, piston, which, he, published, in, 1707, edward, somerset, 2nd, marquess, of, worcester, published, a, book, of, 100, inventions, containing, a, method, for, raising, waters, similar, to, a, coffee, percolator, samuel, morland, a, mathematician, and, inventor, who, worked, on, pumps, left, notes, at, the, vauxhall, ordinance, office, on, a, steam, pump, design, that, thomas, savery, read, in, 1698, savery, built, a, steam, pump, called, the, miner, s, friend, it, employed, both, vacuum, and, pressure, iron, merchant, thomas, newcomen, who, built, the, first, commercial, piston, steam, engine, in, 1712, was, not, known, to, have, any, scientific, training, 32, the, application, of, steam, powered, cast, iron, blowing, cylinders, for, providing, pressurized, air, for, blast, furnaces, lead, to, a, large, increase, in, iron, production, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, higher, furnace, temperatures, made, possible, with, steam, powered, blast, allowed, for, the, use, of, more, lime, in, blast, furnaces, which, enabled, the, transition, from, charcoal, to, coke, these, innovations, lowered, the, cost, of, iron, making, horse, railways, and, iron, bridges, practical, the, puddling, process, patented, by, henry, cort, in, 1784, produced, large, scale, quantities, of, wrought, iron, hot, blast, patented, by, james, beaumont, neilson, in, 1828, greatly, lowered, the, amount, of, fuel, needed, to, smelt, iron, with, the, development, of, the, high, pressure, steam, engine, the, power, to, weight, ratio, of, steam, engines, made, practical, steamboats, and, locomotives, possible, new, steel, making, processes, such, as, the, bessemer, process, and, the, open, hearth, furnace, ushered, in, an, area, of, heavy, engineering, in, the, late, 19th, century, one, of, the, most, famous, engineers, of, the, mid, 19th, century, was, isambard, kingdom, brunel, who, built, railroads, dockyards, and, steamships, the, industrial, revolution, created, a, demand, for, machinery, with, metal, parts, which, led, to, the, development, of, several, machine, tools, boring, cast, iron, cylinders, with, precision, was, not, possible, until, john, wilkinson, invented, his, boring, machine, which, is, considered, the, first, machine, tool, other, machine, tools, included, the, screw, cutting, lathe, milling, machine, turret, lathe, and, the, metal, planer, precision, machining, techniques, were, developed, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, these, included, the, use, of, gigs, to, guide, the, machining, tool, over, the, work, and, fixtures, to, hold, the, work, in, the, proper, position, machine, tools, and, machining, techniques, capable, of, producing, interchangeable, parts, lead, to, large, scale, factory, production, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, united, states, census, of, 1850, listed, the, occupation, of, engineer, for, the, first, time, with, a, count, of, 2, 000, there, were, fewer, than, 50, engineering, graduates, in, the, u, s, before, 1865, in, 1870, there, were, a, dozen, u, s, mechanical, engineering, graduates, with, that, number, increasing, to, 43, per, year, in, 1875, in, 1890, there, were, 6, 000, engineers, in, civil, mining, mechanical, and, electrical, there, was, no, chair, of, applied, mechanism, and, applied, mechanics, at, cambridge, until, 1875, and, no, chair, of, engineering, at, oxford, until, 1907, germany, established, technical, universities, earlier, the, foundations, of, electrical, engineering, in, the, 1800s, included, the, experiments, of, alessandro, volta, michael, faraday, georg, ohm, and, others, and, the, invention, of, the, electric, telegraph, in, 1816, and, the, electric, motor, in, 1872, the, theoretical, work, of, james, maxwell, see, maxwell, s, equations, and, heinrich, hertz, in, the, late, 19th, century, gave, rise, to, the, field, of, electronics, the, later, inventions, of, the, vacuum, tube, and, the, transistor, further, accelerated, the, development, of, electronics, to, such, an, extent, that, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, currently, outnumber, their, colleagues, of, any, other, engineering, specialty, chemical, engineering, developed, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, industrial, scale, manufacturing, demanded, new, materials, and, new, processes, and, by, 1880, the, need, for, large, scale, production, of, chemicals, was, such, that, a, new, industry, was, created, dedicated, to, the, development, and, large, scale, manufacturing, of, chemicals, in, new, industrial, plants, the, role, of, the, chemical, engineer, was, the, design, of, these, chemical, plants, and, processes, aeronautical, engineering, deals, with, aircraft, design, process, design, while, aerospace, engineering, is, a, more, modern, term, that, expands, the, reach, of, the, discipline, by, including, spacecraft, design, its, origins, can, be, traced, back, to, the, aviation, pioneers, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, although, the, work, of, sir, george, cayley, has, recently, been, dated, as, being, from, the, last, decade, of, the, 18th, century, early, knowledge, of, aeronautical, engineering, was, largely, empirical, with, some, concepts, and, skills, imported, from, other, branches, of, engineering, the, first, phd, in, engineering, technically, applied, science, and, engineering, awarded, in, the, united, states, went, to, josiah, willard, gibbs, at, yale, university, in, 1863, it, was, also, the, second, phd, awarded, in, science, in, the, u, s, only, a, decade, after, the, successful, flights, by, the, wright, brothers, there, was, extensive, development, of, aeronautical, engineering, through, development, of, military, aircraft, that, were, used, in, world, war, i, meanwhile, research, to, provide, fundamental, background, science, continued, by, combining, theoretical, physics, with, experiments, engineering, is, a, broad, discipline, that, is, often, broken, down, into, several, sub, disciplines, although, an, engineer, will, usually, be, trained, in, a, specific, discipline, he, or, she, may, become, multi, disciplined, through, experience, engineering, is, often, characterized, as, having, four, main, branches, chemical, engineering, civil, engineering, electrical, engineering, and, mechanical, engineering, chemical, engineering, is, the, application, of, physics, chemistry, biology, and, engineering, principles, in, order, to, carry, out, chemical, processes, on, a, commercial, scale, such, as, the, manufacture, of, commodity, chemicals, specialty, chemicals, petroleum, refining, microfabrication, fermentation, and, biomolecule, production, civil, engineering, is, the, design, and, construction, of, public, and, private, works, such, as, infrastructure, airports, roads, railways, water, supply, and, treatment, etc, bridges, tunnels, dams, and, buildings, civil, engineering, is, traditionally, broken, into, a, number, of, sub, disciplines, including, structural, engineering, environmental, engineering, and, surveying, it, is, traditionally, considered, to, be, separate, from, military, engineering, electrical, engineering, is, the, design, study, and, manufacture, of, various, electrical, and, electronic, systems, such, as, broadcast, engineering, electrical, circuits, generators, motors, electromagnetic, electromechanical, devices, electronic, devices, electronic, circuits, optical, fibers, optoelectronic, devices, computer, systems, telecommunications, instrumentation, control, systems, and, electronics, mechanical, engineering, is, the, design, and, manufacture, of, physical, or, mechanical, systems, such, as, power, and, energy, systems, aerospace, aircraft, products, weapon, systems, transportation, products, engines, compressors, powertrains, kinematic, chains, vacuum, technology, vibration, isolation, equipment, manufacturing, robotics, turbines, audio, equipments, and, mechatronics, bioengineering, is, the, engineering, of, biological, systems, for, a, useful, purpose, examples, of, bioengineering, research, include, bacteria, engineered, to, produce, chemicals, new, medical, imaging, technology, portable, and, rapid, disease, diagnostic, devices, prosthetics, biopharmaceuticals, and, tissue, engineered, organs, interdisciplinary, engineering, draws, from, more, than, one, of, the, principle, branches, of, the, practice, historically, naval, engineering, and, mining, engineering, were, major, branches, other, engineering, fields, are, manufacturing, engineering, acoustical, engineering, corrosion, engineering, instrumentation, and, control, aerospace, automotive, computer, electronic, information, engineering, petroleum, environmental, systems, audio, software, architectural, agricultural, biosystems, biomedical, geological, textile, industrial, materials, and, nuclear, engineering, these, and, other, branches, of, engineering, are, represented, in, the, 36, licensed, member, institutions, of, the, uk, engineering, council, new, specialties, sometimes, combine, with, the, traditional, fields, and, form, new, branches, for, example, earth, systems, engineering, and, management, involves, a, wide, range, of, subject, areas, including, engineering, studies, environmental, science, engineering, ethics, and, philosophy, of, engineering, aerospace, engineering, covers, the, design, development, manufacture, and, operational, behaviour, of, aircraft, satellites, and, rockets, marine, engineering, covers, the, design, development, manufacture, and, operational, behaviour, of, watercraft, and, stationary, structures, like, oil, platforms, and, ports, computer, engineering, ce, is, a, branch, of, engineering, that, integrates, several, fields, of, computer, science, and, electronic, engineering, required, to, develop, computer, hardware, and, software, computer, engineers, usually, have, training, in, electronic, engineering, or, electrical, engineering, software, design, and, hardware, software, integration, instead, of, only, software, engineering, or, electronic, engineering, geological, engineering, is, associated, with, anything, constructed, on, or, within, the, earth, this, discipline, applies, geological, sciences, and, engineering, principles, to, direct, or, support, the, work, of, other, disciplines, such, as, civil, engineering, environmental, engineering, and, mining, engineering, geological, engineers, are, involved, with, impact, studies, for, facilities, and, operations, that, affect, surface, and, subsurface, environments, such, as, rock, excavations, e, g, tunnels, building, foundation, consolidation, slope, and, fill, stabilization, landslide, risk, assessment, groundwater, monitoring, groundwater, remediation, mining, excavations, and, natural, resource, exploration, one, who, practices, engineering, is, called, an, engineer, and, those, licensed, to, do, so, may, have, more, formal, designations, such, as, professional, engineer, chartered, engineer, incorporated, engineer, ingenieur, european, engineer, or, designated, engineering, representative, in, the, engineering, design, process, engineers, apply, mathematics, and, sciences, such, as, physics, to, find, novel, solutions, to, problems, or, to, improve, existing, solutions, engineers, need, proficient, knowledge, of, relevant, sciences, for, their, design, projects, as, a, result, many, engineers, continue, to, learn, new, material, throughout, their, careers, if, multiple, solutions, exist, engineers, weigh, each, design, choice, based, on, their, merit, and, choose, the, solution, that, best, matches, the, requirements, the, task, of, the, engineer, is, to, identify, understand, and, interpret, the, constraints, on, a, design, in, order, to, yield, a, successful, result, it, is, generally, insufficient, to, build, a, technically, successful, product, rather, it, must, also, meet, further, requirements, constraints, may, include, available, resources, physical, imaginative, or, technical, limitations, flexibility, for, future, modifications, and, additions, and, other, factors, such, as, requirements, for, cost, safety, marketability, productivity, and, serviceability, by, understanding, the, constraints, engineers, derive, specifications, for, the, limits, within, which, a, viable, object, or, system, may, be, produced, and, operated, engineers, use, their, knowledge, of, science, mathematics, logic, economics, and, appropriate, experience, or, tacit, knowledge, to, find, suitable, solutions, to, a, particular, problem, creating, an, appropriate, mathematical, model, of, a, problem, often, allows, them, to, analyze, it, sometimes, definitively, and, to, test, potential, solutions, more, than, one, solution, to, a, design, problem, usually, exists, so, the, different, design, choices, have, to, be, evaluated, on, their, merits, before, the, one, judged, most, suitable, is, chosen, genrich, altshuller, after, gathering, statistics, on, a, large, number, of, patents, suggested, that, compromises, are, at, the, heart, of, low, level, engineering, designs, while, at, a, higher, level, the, best, design, is, one, which, eliminates, the, core, contradiction, causing, the, problem, engineers, typically, attempt, to, predict, how, well, their, designs, will, perform, to, their, specifications, prior, to, full, scale, production, they, use, among, other, things, prototypes, scale, models, simulations, destructive, tests, nondestructive, tests, and, stress, tests, testing, ensures, that, products, will, perform, as, expected, but, only, in, so, far, as, the, testing, has, been, representative, of, use, in, service, for, products, such, as, aircraft, that, are, used, differently, by, different, users, failures, and, unexpected, shortcomings, and, necessary, design, changes, can, be, expected, throughout, the, operational, life, of, the, product, engineers, take, on, the, responsibility, of, producing, designs, that, will, perform, as, well, as, expected, and, except, those, employed, in, specific, areas, of, the, arms, industry, will, not, harm, people, engineers, typically, include, a, factor, of, safety, in, their, designs, to, reduce, the, risk, of, unexpected, failure, the, study, of, failed, products, is, known, as, forensic, engineering, it, attempts, to, identify, the, cause, of, failure, to, allow, a, redesign, of, the, product, and, so, prevent, a, re, occurrence, careful, analysis, is, needed, to, establish, the, cause, of, failure, of, a, product, the, consequences, of, a, failure, may, vary, in, severity, from, the, minor, cost, of, a, machine, breakdown, to, large, loss, of, life, in, the, case, of, accidents, involving, aircraft, and, large, stationary, structures, like, buildings, and, dams, as, with, all, modern, scientific, and, technological, endeavors, computers, and, software, play, an, increasingly, important, role, as, well, as, the, typical, business, application, software, there, are, a, number, of, computer, aided, applications, computer, aided, technologies, specifically, for, engineering, computers, can, be, used, to, generate, models, of, fundamental, physical, processes, which, can, be, solved, using, numerical, methods, one, of, the, most, widely, used, design, tools, in, the, profession, is, computer, aided, design, cad, software, it, enables, engineers, to, create, 3d, models, 2d, drawings, and, schematics, of, their, designs, cad, together, with, digital, mockup, dmu, and, cae, software, such, as, finite, element, method, analysis, or, analytic, element, method, allows, engineers, to, create, models, of, designs, that, can, be, analyzed, without, having, to, make, expensive, and, time, consuming, physical, prototypes, these, allow, products, and, components, to, be, checked, for, flaws, assess, fit, and, assembly, study, ergonomics, and, to, analyze, static, and, dynamic, characteristics, of, systems, such, as, stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic, emissions, electrical, currents, and, voltages, digital, logic, levels, fluid, flows, and, kinematics, access, and, distribution, of, all, this, information, is, generally, organized, with, the, use, of, product, data, management, software, there, are, also, many, tools, to, support, specific, engineering, tasks, such, as, computer, aided, manufacturing, cam, software, to, generate, cnc, machining, instructions, manufacturing, process, management, software, for, production, engineering, eda, for, printed, circuit, board, pcb, and, circuit, schematics, for, electronic, engineers, mro, applications, for, maintenance, management, and, architecture, engineering, and, construction, aec, software, for, civil, engineering, in, recent, years, the, use, of, computer, software, to, aid, the, development, of, goods, has, collectively, come, to, be, known, as, product, lifecycle, management, plm, the, engineering, profession, engages, in, a, range, of, activities, from, collaboration, at, the, societal, level, and, smaller, individual, projects, almost, all, engineering, projects, are, obligated, to, a, funding, source, a, company, a, set, of, investors, or, a, government, the, types, of, engineering, that, are, less, constrained, by, such, a, funding, source, are, pro, bono, and, open, design, engineering, engineering, has, interconnections, with, society, culture, and, human, behavior, most, products, and, constructions, used, by, modern, society, are, influenced, by, engineering, engineering, activities, have, an, impact, on, the, environment, society, economies, and, public, safety, engineering, projects, can, be, controversial, examples, from, different, engineering, disciplines, include, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, the, three, gorges, dam, the, design, and, use, of, sport, utility, vehicles, and, the, extraction, of, oil, in, response, some, engineering, companies, have, enacted, serious, corporate, and, social, responsibility, policies, the, attainment, of, many, of, the, millennium, development, goals, requires, the, achievement, of, sufficient, engineering, capacity, to, develop, infrastructure, and, sustainable, technological, development, overseas, development, and, relief, ngos, make, considerable, use, of, engineers, to, apply, solutions, in, disaster, and, development, scenarios, some, charitable, organizations, use, engineering, directly, for, development, engineering, companies, in, more, developed, economies, face, challenges, with, regard, to, the, number, of, engineers, being, trained, compared, with, those, retiring, this, problem, is, prominent, in, the, uk, where, engineering, has, a, poor, image, and, low, status, there, are, negative, economic, and, political, issues, that, this, can, cause, as, well, as, ethical, issues, it, is, agreed, the, engineering, profession, faces, an, image, crisis, the, uk, holds, the, most, engineering, companies, compared, to, other, european, countries, together, with, the, united, states, many, engineering, societies, have, established, codes, of, practice, and, codes, of, ethics, to, guide, members, and, inform, the, public, at, large, the, national, society, of, professional, engineers, code, of, ethics, states, engineering, is, an, important, and, learned, profession, as, members, of, this, profession, engineers, are, expected, to, exhibit, the, highest, standards, of, honesty, and, integrity, engineering, has, a, direct, and, vital, impact, on, the, quality, of, life, for, all, people, accordingly, the, services, provided, by, engineers, require, honesty, impartiality, fairness, and, equity, and, must, be, dedicated, to, the, protection, of, the, public, health, safety, and, welfare, engineers, must, perform, under, a, standard, of, professional, behavior, that, requires, adherence, to, the, highest, principles, of, ethical, conduct, in, canada, engineers, wear, the, iron, ring, as, a, symbol, and, reminder, of, the, obligations, and, ethics, associated, with, their, profession, scientists, study, the, world, as, it, is, engineers, create, the, world, that, has, never, been, there, exists, an, overlap, between, the, sciences, and, engineering, practice, in, engineering, one, applies, science, both, areas, of, endeavor, rely, on, accurate, observation, of, materials, and, phenomena, both, use, mathematics, and, classification, criteria, to, analyze, and, communicate, observations, scientists, may, also, have, to, complete, engineering, tasks, such, as, designing, experimental, apparatus, or, building, prototypes, conversely, in, the, process, of, developing, technology, engineers, sometimes, find, themselves, exploring, new, phenomena, thus, becoming, for, the, moment, scientists, or, more, precisely, engineering, scientists, in, the, book, what, engineers, know, and, how, they, know, it, walter, vincenti, asserts, that, engineering, research, has, a, character, different, from, that, of, scientific, research, first, it, often, deals, with, areas, in, which, the, basic, physics, or, chemistry, are, well, understood, but, the, problems, themselves, are, too, complex, to, solve, in, an, exact, manner, there, is, a, real, and, important, difference, between, engineering, and, physics, as, similar, to, any, science, field, has, to, do, with, technology, physics, is, an, exploratory, science, that, seeks, knowledge, of, principles, while, engineering, uses, knowledge, for, practical, applications, of, principles, the, former, equates, an, understanding, into, a, mathematical, principle, while, the, latter, measures, variables, involved, and, creates, technology, for, technology, physics, is, an, auxiliary, and, in, a, way, technology, is, considered, as, applied, physics, though, physics, and, engineering, are, interrelated, it, does, not, mean, that, a, physicist, is, trained, to, do, an, engineer, s, job, a, physicist, would, typically, require, additional, and, relevant, training, physicists, and, engineers, engage, in, different, lines, of, work, but, phd, physicists, who, specialize, in, sectors, of, engineering, physics, and, applied, physics, are, titled, as, technology, officer, r, d, engineers, and, system, engineers, an, example, of, this, is, the, use, of, numerical, approximations, to, the, navier, stokes, equations, to, describe, aerodynamic, flow, over, an, aircraft, or, the, use, of, the, finite, element, method, to, calculate, the, stresses, in, complex, components, second, engineering, research, employs, many, semi, empirical, methods, that, are, foreign, to, pure, scientific, research, one, example, being, the, method, of, parameter, variation, as, stated, by, fung, et, al, in, the, revision, to, the, classic, engineering, text, foundations, of, solid, mechanics, engineering, is, quite, different, from, science, scientists, try, to, understand, nature, engineers, try, to, make, things, that, do, not, exist, in, nature, engineers, stress, innovation, and, invention, to, embody, an, invention, the, engineer, must, put, his, idea, in, concrete, terms, and, design, something, that, people, can, use, that, something, can, be, a, complex, system, device, a, gadget, a, material, a, method, a, computing, program, an, innovative, experiment, a, new, solution, to, a, problem, or, an, improvement, on, what, already, exists, since, a, design, has, to, be, realistic, and, functional, it, must, have, its, geometry, dimensions, and, characteristics, data, defined, in, the, past, engineers, working, on, new, designs, found, that, they, did, not, have, all, the, required, information, to, make, design, decisions, most, often, they, were, limited, by, insufficient, scientific, knowledge, thus, they, studied, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and, mechanics, often, they, had, to, add, to, the, sciences, relevant, to, their, profession, thus, engineering, sciences, were, born, although, engineering, solutions, make, use, of, scientific, principles, engineers, must, also, take, into, account, safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and, constructability, or, ease, of, fabrication, as, well, as, the, environment, ethical, and, legal, considerations, such, as, patent, infringement, or, liability, in, the, case, of, failure, of, the, solution, the, study, of, the, human, body, albeit, from, different, directions, and, for, different, purposes, is, an, important, common, link, between, medicine, and, some, engineering, disciplines, medicine, aims, to, sustain, repair, enhance, and, even, replace, functions, of, the, human, body, if, necessary, through, the, use, of, technology, modern, medicine, can, replace, several, of, the, body, s, functions, through, the, use, of, artificial, organs, and, can, significantly, alter, the, function, of, the, human, body, through, artificial, devices, such, as, for, example, brain, implants, and, pacemakers, the, fields, of, bionics, and, medical, bionics, are, dedicated, to, the, study, of, synthetic, implants, pertaining, to, natural, systems, conversely, some, engineering, disciplines, view, the, human, body, as, a, biological, machine, worth, studying, and, are, dedicated, to, emulating, many, of, its, functions, by, replacing, biology, with, technology, this, has, led, to, fields, such, as, artificial, intelligence, neural, networks, fuzzy, logic, and, robotics, there, are, also, substantial, interdisciplinary, interactions, between, engineering, and, medicine, both, fields, provide, solutions, to, real, world, problems, this, often, requires, moving, forward, before, phenomena, are, completely, understood, in, a, more, rigorous, scientific, sense, and, therefore, experimentation, and, empirical, knowledge, is, an, integral, part, of, both, medicine, in, part, studies, the, function, of, the, human, body, the, human, body, as, a, biological, machine, has, many, functions, that, can, be, modeled, using, engineering, methods, the, heart, for, example, functions, much, like, a, pump, the, skeleton, is, like, a, linked, structure, with, levers, the, brain, produces, electrical, signals, etc, these, similarities, as, well, as, the, increasing, importance, and, application, of, engineering, principles, in, medicine, led, to, the, development, of, the, field, of, biomedical, engineering, that, uses, concepts, developed, in, both, disciplines, newly, emerging, branches, of, science, such, as, systems, biology, are, adapting, analytical, tools, traditionally, used, for, engineering, such, as, systems, modeling, and, computational, analysis, to, the, description, of, biological, systems, there, are, connections, between, engineering, and, art, for, example, architecture, landscape, architecture, and, industrial, design, even, to, the, extent, that, these, disciplines, may, sometimes, be, included, in, a, university, s, faculty, of, engineering, the, art, institute, of, chicago, for, instance, held, an, exhibition, about, the, art, of, nasa, s, aerospace, design, robert, maillart, s, bridge, design, is, perceived, by, some, to, have, been, deliberately, artistic, at, the, university, of, south, florida, an, engineering, professor, through, a, grant, with, the, national, science, foundation, has, developed, a, course, that, connects, art, and, engineering, among, famous, historical, figures, leonardo, da, vinci, is, a, well, known, renaissance, artist, and, engineer, and, a, prime, example, of, the, nexus, between, art, and, engineering, business, engineering, deals, with, the, relationship, between, professional, engineering, it, systems, business, administration, and, change, management, engineering, management, or, management, engineering, is, a, specialized, field, of, management, concerned, with, engineering, practice, or, the, engineering, industry, sector, the, demand, for, management, focused, engineers, or, from, the, opposite, perspective, managers, with, an, understanding, of, engineering, has, resulted, in, the, development, of, specialized, engineering, management, degrees, that, develop, the, knowledge, and, skills, needed, for, these, roles, during, an, engineering, management, course, students, will, develop, industrial, engineering, skills, knowledge, and, expertise, alongside, knowledge, of, business, administration, management, techniques, and, strategic, thinking, engineers, specializing, in, change, management, must, have, in, depth, knowledge, of, the, application, of, industrial, and, organizational, psychology, principles, and, methods, professional, engineers, often, train, as, certified, management, consultants, in, the, very, specialized, field, of, management, consulting, applied, to, engineering, practice, or, the, engineering, sector, this, work, often, deals, with, large, scale, complex, business, transformation, or, business, process, management, initiatives, in, aerospace, and, defence, automotive, oil, and, gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food, and, beverage, electrical, and, electronics, power, distribution, and, generation, utilities, and, transportation, systems, this, combination, of, technical, engineering, practice, management, consulting, practice, industry, sector, knowledge, and, change, management, expertise, enables, professional, engineers, who, are, also, qualified, as, management, consultants, to, lead, major, business, transformation, initiatives, these, initiatives, are, typically, sponsored, by, c, level, executives, in, political, science, the, term, engineering, has, been, borrowed, for, the, study, of, the, subjects, of, social, engineering, and, political, engineering, which, deal, with, forming, political, and, social, structures, using, engineering, methodology, coupled, with, political, science, principles, marketing, engineering, and, financial, engineering, have, similarly, borrowed, the, term
