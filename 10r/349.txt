a, lever, is, a, simple, machine, consisting, of, a, beam, or, rigid, rod, pivoted, at, a, fixed, hinge, or, fulcrum, a, lever, is, a, rigid, body, capable, of, rotating, on, a, point, on, itself, on, the, basis, of, the, locations, of, fulcrum, load, and, effort, the, lever, is, divided, into, three, types, it, is, one, of, the, six, simple, machines, identified, by, renaissance, scientists, a, lever, amplifies, an, input, force, to, provide, a, greater, output, force, which, is, said, to, provide, leverage, which, is, mechanical, advantage, gained, in, the, system, equal, to, the, ratio, of, the, output, force, to, the, input, force, as, such, the, lever, is, a, mechanical, advantage, device, trading, off, force, against, movement, the, word, lever, entered, english, around, ad, 1300, from, old, french, levier, this, sprang, from, the, stem, of, the, verb, lever, meaning, to, raise, the, verb, in, turn, goes, back, to, latin, levare, itself, from, the, adjective, levis, meaning, light, as, in, not, heavy, the, word, s, primary, origin, is, the, proto, indo, european, stem, legwh, meaning, light, easy, or, nimble, among, other, things, the, pie, stem, also, gave, rise, to, the, english, word, light, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, lever, mechanism, dates, back, to, the, ancient, near, east, c, 5000, bc, when, it, was, first, used, in, a, simple, balance, scale, in, ancient, egypt, c, 4400, bc, a, foot, pedal, was, used, for, the, earliest, horizontal, frame, loom, in, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, c, 3000, bc, the, shadouf, a, crane, like, device, that, uses, a, lever, mechanism, was, invented, in, ancient, egypt, workmen, used, the, lever, to, move, and, uplift, obelisks, weighing, more, than, 100, tons, this, is, evident, from, the, recesses, in, the, large, blocks, and, the, handling, bosses, which, could, not, be, used, for, any, purpose, other, than, for, levers, the, earliest, remaining, writings, regarding, levers, date, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, were, provided, by, common, belief, by, the, greek, mathematician, archimedes, who, famously, stated, give, me, a, lever, long, enough, and, a, fulcrum, on, which, to, place, it, and, i, shall, move, the, world, autumn, stanley, argues, that, the, digging, stick, can, be, considered, the, first, lever, which, would, position, prehistoric, women, as, the, inventors, of, lever, technology, a, lever, is, a, beam, connected, to, ground, by, a, hinge, or, pivot, called, a, fulcrum, the, ideal, lever, does, not, dissipate, or, store, energy, which, means, there, is, no, friction, in, the, hinge, or, bending, in, the, beam, in, this, case, the, power, into, the, lever, equals, the, power, out, and, the, ratio, of, output, to, input, force, is, given, by, the, ratio, of, the, distances, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, points, of, application, of, these, forces, this, is, known, as, the, law, of, the, lever, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, lever, can, be, determined, by, considering, the, balance, of, moments, or, torque, t, about, the, fulcrum, if, the, distance, traveled, is, greater, then, the, output, force, is, lessened, t, 1, f, 1, a, t, 2, f, 2, b, displaystyle, begin, aligned, t, 1, f, 1, a, quad, t, 2, f, 2, b, end, aligned, where, f, 1, is, the, input, force, to, the, lever, and, f, 2, is, the, output, force, the, distances, a, and, b, are, the, perpendicular, distances, between, the, forces, and, the, fulcrum, since, the, moments, of, torque, must, be, balanced, t, 1, t, 2, displaystyle, t, 1, t, 2, so, f, 1, a, f, 2, b, displaystyle, f, 1, a, f, 2, b, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, lever, is, the, ratio, of, output, force, to, input, force, m, a, f, 2, f, 1, a, b, displaystyle, ma, frac, f, 2, f, 1, frac, a, b, this, relationship, shows, that, the, mechanical, advantage, can, be, computed, from, ratio, of, the, distances, from, the, fulcrum, to, where, the, input, and, output, forces, are, applied, to, the, lever, assuming, a, weightless, lever, and, no, losses, due, to, friction, flexibility, or, wear, this, remains, true, even, though, the, horizontal, distance, perpendicular, to, the, pull, of, gravity, of, both, a, and, b, change, diminish, as, the, lever, changes, to, any, position, away, from, the, horizontal, levers, are, classified, by, the, relative, positions, of, the, fulcrum, effort, and, resistance, or, load, it, is, common, to, call, the, input, force, effort, and, the, output, force, load, or, resistance, this, allows, the, identification, of, three, classes, of, levers, by, the, relative, locations, of, the, fulcrum, the, resistance, and, the, effort, these, cases, are, described, by, the, mnemonic, fre, 123, where, the, f, fulcrum, is, between, r, and, e, for, the, 1st, class, lever, the, r, resistance, is, between, f, and, e, for, the, 2nd, class, lever, and, the, e, effort, is, between, f, and, r, for, the, 3rd, class, lever, a, compound, lever, comprises, several, levers, acting, in, series, the, resistance, from, one, lever, in, a, system, of, levers, acts, as, effort, for, the, next, and, thus, the, applied, force, is, transferred, from, one, lever, to, the, next, examples, of, compound, levers, include, scales, nail, clippers, and, piano, keys, the, malleus, incus, and, stapes, are, small, bones, in, the, middle, ear, connected, as, compound, levers, that, transfer, sound, waves, from, the, eardrum, to, the, oval, window, of, the, cochlea, the, lever, is, a, movable, bar, that, pivots, on, a, fulcrum, attached, to, a, fixed, point, the, lever, operates, by, applying, forces, at, different, distances, from, the, fulcrum, or, a, pivot, as, the, lever, rotates, around, the, fulcrum, points, farther, from, this, pivot, move, faster, than, points, closer, to, the, pivot, therefore, a, force, applied, to, a, point, farther, from, the, pivot, must, be, less, than, the, force, located, at, a, point, closer, in, because, power, is, the, product, of, force, and, velocity, if, a, and, b, are, distances, from, the, fulcrum, to, points, a, and, b, and, the, force, f, a, applied, to, a, is, the, input, and, the, force, f, b, applied, at, b, is, the, output, the, ratio, of, the, velocities, of, points, a, and, b, is, given, by, a, b, so, we, have, the, ratio, of, the, output, force, to, the, input, force, or, mechanical, advantage, is, given, by, m, a, f, b, f, a, a, b, displaystyle, ma, frac, f, b, f, a, frac, a, b, this, is, the, law, of, the, lever, which, was, proven, by, archimedes, using, geometric, reasoning, it, shows, that, if, the, distance, a, from, the, fulcrum, to, where, the, input, force, is, applied, point, a, is, greater, than, the, distance, b, from, fulcrum, to, where, the, output, force, is, applied, point, b, then, the, lever, amplifies, the, input, force, on, the, other, hand, if, the, distance, a, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, input, force, is, less, than, the, distance, b, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, output, force, then, the, lever, reduces, the, input, force, the, use, of, velocity, in, the, static, analysis, of, a, lever, is, an, application, of, the, principle, of, virtual, work, a, lever, is, modeled, as, a, rigid, bar, connected, to, a, ground, frame, by, a, hinged, joint, called, a, fulcrum, the, lever, is, operated, by, applying, an, input, force, f, a, at, a, point, a, located, by, the, coordinate, vector, r, a, on, the, bar, the, lever, then, exerts, an, output, force, f, b, at, the, point, b, located, by, r, b, the, rotation, of, the, lever, about, the, fulcrum, p, is, defined, by, the, rotation, angle, in, radians, let, the, coordinate, vector, of, the, point, p, that, defines, the, fulcrum, be, r, p, and, introduce, the, lengths, a, r, a, r, p, b, r, b, r, p, displaystyle, a, mathbf, r, a, mathbf, r, p, quad, b, mathbf, r, b, mathbf, r, p, which, are, the, distances, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, input, point, a, and, to, the, output, point, b, respectively, now, introduce, the, unit, vectors, e, a, and, e, b, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, point, a, and, b, so, r, a, r, p, a, e, a, r, b, r, p, b, e, b, displaystyle, mathbf, r, a, mathbf, r, p, a, mathbf, e, a, quad, mathbf, r, b, mathbf, r, p, b, mathbf, e, b, the, velocity, of, the, points, a, and, b, are, obtained, as, v, a, a, e, a, v, b, b, e, b, displaystyle, mathbf, v, a, dot, theta, a, mathbf, e, a, perp, quad, mathbf, v, b, dot, theta, b, mathbf, e, b, perp, where, e, a, and, e, b, are, unit, vectors, perpendicular, to, e, a, and, e, b, respectively, the, angle, is, the, generalized, coordinate, that, defines, the, configuration, of, the, lever, and, the, generalized, force, associated, with, this, coordinate, is, given, by, f, f, a, v, a, f, b, v, b, a, f, a, e, a, b, f, b, e, b, a, f, a, b, f, b, displaystyle, f, theta, mathbf, f, a, cdot, frac, partial, mathbf, v, a, partial, dot, theta, mathbf, f, b, cdot, frac, partial, mathbf, v, b, partial, dot, theta, a, mathbf, f, a, cdot, mathbf, e, a, perp, b, mathbf, f, b, cdot, mathbf, e, b, perp, af, a, bf, b, where, f, a, and, f, b, are, components, of, the, forces, that, are, perpendicular, to, the, radial, segments, pa, and, pb, the, principle, of, virtual, work, states, that, at, equilibrium, the, generalized, force, is, zero, that, is, f, a, f, a, b, f, b, 0, displaystyle, f, theta, af, a, bf, b, 0, thus, the, ratio, of, the, output, force, f, b, to, the, input, force, f, a, is, obtained, as, m, a, f, b, f, a, a, b, displaystyle, ma, frac, f, b, f, a, frac, a, b, which, is, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, lever, this, equation, shows, that, if, the, distance, a, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, point, a, where, the, input, force, is, applied, is, greater, than, the, distance, b, from, fulcrum, to, the, point, b, where, the, output, force, is, applied, then, the, lever, amplifies, the, input, force, if, the, opposite, is, true, that, the, distance, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, input, point, a, is, less, than, from, the, fulcrum, to, the, output, point, b, then, the, lever, reduces, the, magnitude, of, the, input, force
