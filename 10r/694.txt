july, 3, 1868, 156, years, ago, 1868, 07, 03, first, elevated, rapid, transit, operation, the, new, york, city, subway, is, a, rapid, transit, system, in, the, new, york, city, boroughs, of, manhattan, brooklyn, queens, and, the, bronx, it, is, owned, by, the, government, of, new, york, city, and, leased, to, the, new, york, city, transit, authority, an, affiliate, agency, of, the, state, run, metropolitan, transportation, authority, mta, opened, on, october, 27, 1904, the, new, york, city, subway, is, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, public, transit, systems, one, of, the, most, used, and, the, one, with, the, most, stations, with, 472, stations, in, operation, 423, if, stations, connected, by, transfers, are, counted, as, single, stations, the, system, has, operated, 24, 7, service, every, day, of, the, year, throughout, most, of, its, history, barring, emergencies, and, disasters, by, annual, ridership, the, new, york, city, subway, is, the, busiest, rapid, transit, system, in, both, the, western, hemisphere, and, the, western, world, as, well, as, the, eleventh, busiest, rapid, transit, rail, system, in, the, world, the, subway, carried, 2, 027, 286, 000, unlinked, non, unique, riders, in, 2023, 2, daily, ridership, has, been, calculated, since, 1985, the, record, over, 6, 2, million, was, set, on, october, 29, 2015, the, system, is, also, one, of, the, world, s, longest, overall, the, system, contains, 248, miles, 399, km, of, routes, translating, into, 665, miles, 1, 070, km, of, revenue, track, and, a, total, of, 850, miles, 1, 370, km, including, non, revenue, trackage, of, the, system, s, 28, routes, or, services, which, usually, share, track, or, lines, with, other, services, 25, pass, through, manhattan, the, exceptions, being, the, g, train, the, franklin, avenue, shuttle, and, the, rockaway, park, shuttle, large, portions, of, the, subway, outside, manhattan, are, elevated, on, embankments, or, in, open, cuts, and, a, few, stretches, of, track, run, at, ground, level, 40, of, track, is, above, ground, many, lines, and, stations, have, both, express, and, local, services, these, lines, have, three, or, four, tracks, normally, the, outer, two, are, used, by, local, trains, while, the, inner, one, or, two, are, used, by, express, trains, as, of, 2018, the, new, york, city, subway, s, budgetary, burden, for, expenditures, was, 8, 7, billion, supported, by, collection, of, fares, bridge, tolls, and, earmarked, regional, taxes, and, fees, as, well, as, direct, funding, from, state, and, local, governments, alfred, ely, beach, built, the, first, demonstration, for, an, underground, transit, system, in, new, york, city, in, 1869, and, opened, it, in, february, 1870, his, beach, pneumatic, transit, only, extended, 312, feet, 95, m, under, broadway, in, lower, manhattan, operating, from, warren, street, to, murray, street, and, exhibited, his, idea, for, an, atmospheric, railway, as, a, subway, the, tunnel, was, never, extended, for, political, and, financial, reasons, today, no, part, of, this, line, remains, as, the, tunnel, was, completely, within, the, limits, of, the, present, day, city, hall, station, under, broadway, the, great, blizzard, of, 1888, helped, demonstrate, the, benefits, of, an, underground, transportation, system, a, plan, for, the, construction, of, the, subway, was, approved, in, 1894, and, construction, began, in, 1900, even, though, the, underground, portions, of, the, subway, had, yet, to, be, built, several, above, ground, segments, of, the, modern, day, new, york, city, subway, system, were, already, in, service, by, then, the, oldest, structure, still, in, use, opened, in, 1885, as, part, of, the, bmt, lexington, avenue, line, in, brooklyn, and, is, now, part, of, the, bmt, jamaica, line, the, oldest, right, of, way, which, is, part, of, the, bmt, west, end, line, near, coney, island, creek, was, in, use, in, 1864, as, a, steam, railroad, called, the, brooklyn, bath, and, coney, island, rail, road, the, first, underground, line, of, the, subway, opened, on, october, 27, 1904, almost, 36, years, after, the, opening, of, the, first, elevated, line, in, new, york, city, which, became, the, irt, ninth, avenue, line, the, 9, 1, mile, 14, 6, km, subway, line, then, called, the, manhattan, main, line, ran, from, city, hall, station, northward, under, lafayette, street, then, named, elm, street, and, park, avenue, then, named, fourth, avenue, before, turning, westward, at, 42nd, street, it, then, curved, northward, again, at, times, square, continuing, under, broadway, before, terminating, at, 145th, street, station, in, harlem, its, operation, was, leased, to, the, interborough, rapid, transit, company, irt, and, over, 150, 000, passengers, paid, the, 5, cent, fare, 2, in, 2023, dollars, to, ride, it, on, the, first, day, of, operation, by, the, late, 1900s, and, early, 1910s, the, lines, had, been, consolidated, into, two, privately, owned, systems, the, irt, and, the, brooklyn, rapid, transit, company, brt, later, brooklyn, manhattan, transit, corporation, bmt, the, city, built, most, of, the, lines, and, leased, them, to, the, companies, the, first, line, of, the, city, owned, and, operated, independent, subway, system, ind, opened, in, 1932, this, system, was, intended, to, compete, with, the, private, systems, and, allow, some, of, the, elevated, railways, to, be, torn, down, but, stayed, within, the, core, of, the, city, due, to, its, small, startup, capital, this, required, it, to, be, run, at, cost, necessitating, fares, up, to, double, the, five, cent, fare, of, the, time, or, 10, 3, in, 2023, dollars, in, 1940, the, city, bought, the, two, private, systems, some, elevated, lines, ceased, service, immediately, while, others, closed, soon, after, integration, was, slow, but, several, connections, were, built, between, the, ind, and, bmt, these, now, operate, as, one, division, called, the, b, division, since, the, former, irt, tunnels, are, narrower, have, sharper, curves, and, shorter, station, platforms, they, cannot, accommodate, b, division, cars, and, the, former, irt, remains, its, own, division, the, a, division, many, passenger, transfers, between, stations, of, all, three, former, companies, have, been, created, allowing, the, entire, network, to, be, treated, as, a, single, unit, during, the, late, 1940s, the, system, recorded, high, ridership, and, on, december, 23, 1946, the, system, wide, record, of, 8, 872, 249, fares, was, set, 73, the, new, york, city, transit, authority, nycta, a, public, authority, presided, by, new, york, city, was, created, in, 1953, to, take, over, subway, bus, and, streetcar, operations, from, the, city, and, placed, under, control, of, the, state, level, metropolitan, transportation, authority, in, 1968, organized, in, 1934, by, transit, workers, of, the, brt, irt, and, ind, the, transport, workers, union, of, america, local, 100, remains, the, largest, and, most, influential, local, of, the, labor, unions, since, the, union, s, founding, there, have, been, three, union, strikes, over, contract, disputes, with, the, mta, 12, days, in, 1966, 11, days, in, 1980, and, three, days, in, 2005, by, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, new, york, city, subway, was, at, an, all, time, low, ridership, had, dropped, to, 1910s, levels, and, graffiti, and, crime, were, rampant, maintenance, was, poor, and, delays, and, track, problems, were, common, still, the, nycta, managed, to, open, six, new, subway, stations, in, the, 1980s, make, the, current, fleet, of, subway, cars, graffiti, free, as, well, as, order, 1, 775, new, subway, cars, by, the, early, 1990s, conditions, had, improved, significantly, although, maintenance, backlogs, accumulated, during, those, 20, years, are, still, being, fixed, today, entering, the, 21st, century, progress, continued, despite, several, disasters, the, september, 11, attacks, resulted, in, service, disruptions, on, lines, running, through, lower, manhattan, particularly, the, irt, broadway, seventh, avenue, line, which, ran, directly, underneath, the, world, trade, center, sections, of, the, tunnel, as, well, as, the, cortlandt, street, station, which, was, directly, underneath, the, twin, towers, were, severely, damaged, rebuilding, required, the, suspension, of, service, on, that, line, south, of, chambers, street, ten, other, nearby, stations, were, closed, for, cleanup, by, march, 2002, seven, of, those, stations, had, reopened, except, for, cortlandt, street, the, rest, reopened, in, september, 2002, along, with, service, south, of, chambers, street, cortlandt, street, reopened, in, september, 2018, in, october, 2012, hurricane, sandy, flooded, several, underwater, tunnels, and, other, facilities, near, new, york, harbor, as, well, as, trackage, over, jamaica, bay, the, immediate, damage, was, fixed, within, six, months, but, long, term, resiliency, and, rehabilitation, projects, continued, for, several, years, the, recovery, projects, after, the, hurricane, included, the, restoration, of, the, new, south, ferry, station, from, 2012, to, 2017, the, full, closure, of, the, montague, street, tunnel, from, 2013, to, 2014, and, the, partial, 14th, street, tunnel, shutdown, from, 2019, to, 2020, annual, ridership, on, the, new, york, city, subway, system, which, totaled, nearly, 1, 7, billion, in, 2019, declined, dramatically, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, did, not, surpass, one, billion, again, until, 2022, when, the, irt, subway, debuted, in, 1904, the, typical, tunnel, construction, method, was, cut, and, cover, the, street, was, torn, up, to, dig, the, tunnel, below, before, being, rebuilt, from, above, traffic, on, the, street, above, would, be, interrupted, due, to, the, digging, up, of, the, street, temporary, steel, and, wooden, bridges, carried, surface, traffic, above, the, construction, contractors, in, this, type, of, construction, faced, many, obstacles, both, natural, and, human, made, they, had, to, deal, with, rock, formations, and, groundwater, which, required, pumps, twelve, miles, of, sewers, as, well, as, water, and, gas, mains, electric, conduits, and, steam, pipes, had, to, be, rerouted, street, railways, had, to, be, torn, up, to, allow, the, work, the, foundations, of, tall, buildings, often, ran, near, the, subway, construction, and, in, some, cases, needed, underpinning, to, ensure, stability, this, method, worked, well, for, digging, soft, dirt, and, gravel, near, the, street, surface, tunnelling, shields, were, required, for, deeper, sections, such, as, the, harlem, and, east, river, tunnels, which, used, cast, iron, tubes, rock, or, concrete, lined, tunnels, were, used, on, segments, from, 33rd, to, 42nd, streets, under, park, avenue, 116th, to, 120th, streets, under, broadway, 145th, to, dyckman, streets, fort, george, under, broadway, and, st, nicholas, avenue, and, 96th, street, and, broadway, to, central, park, north, and, lenox, avenue, about, 40, of, the, subway, system, runs, on, surface, or, elevated, tracks, including, steel, or, cast, iron, elevated, structures, concrete, viaducts, embankments, open, cuts, and, surface, routes, as, of, 2019, there, are, 168, miles, 270, km, of, elevated, tracks, all, of, these, construction, methods, are, completely, grade, separated, from, road, and, pedestrian, crossings, and, most, crossings, of, two, subway, tracks, are, grade, separated, with, flying, junctions, the, sole, exceptions, of, at, grade, junctions, of, two, lines, in, regular, service, are, the, 142nd, street, and, myrtle, avenue, junctions, whose, tracks, intersect, at, the, same, level, as, well, as, the, same, direction, pairs, of, tracks, on, the, irt, eastern, parkway, line, at, rogers, junction, the, 7, 700, workers, who, built, the, original, subway, lines, were, mostly, immigrants, living, in, manhattan, more, recent, projects, use, tunnel, boring, machines, which, increase, the, cost, however, they, minimize, disruption, at, street, level, and, avoid, already, existing, utilities, examples, of, such, projects, include, the, extension, of, the, irt, flushing, line, and, the, ind, second, avenue, line, since, the, opening, of, the, original, new, york, city, subway, line, in, 1904, multiple, official, and, planning, agencies, have, proposed, numerous, extensions, to, the, subway, system, one, of, the, more, expansive, proposals, was, the, ind, second, system, part, of, a, plan, to, construct, new, subway, lines, in, addition, to, taking, over, existing, subway, lines, and, railroad, rights, of, way, the, most, grandiose, ind, second, subway, plan, conceived, in, 1929, was, to, be, part, of, the, city, operated, ind, and, was, to, comprise, almost, 1, 3, of, the, current, subway, system, by, 1939, with, unification, planned, all, three, systems, were, included, within, the, plan, which, was, ultimately, never, carried, out, many, different, plans, were, proposed, over, the, years, of, the, subway, s, existence, but, expansion, of, the, subway, system, mostly, stopped, during, world, war, ii, though, most, of, the, routes, proposed, over, the, decades, have, never, seen, construction, discussion, remains, strong, to, develop, some, of, these, lines, to, alleviate, existing, subway, capacity, constraints, and, overcrowding, the, most, notable, being, the, proposals, for, the, second, avenue, subway, plans, for, new, lines, date, back, to, the, early, 1910s, and, expansion, plans, have, been, proposed, during, many, years, of, the, system, s, existence, after, the, ind, sixth, avenue, line, was, completed, in, 1940, the, city, went, into, great, debt, and, only, 33, new, stations, have, been, added, to, the, system, since, nineteen, of, which, were, part, of, defunct, railways, that, already, existed, five, stations, were, on, the, abandoned, new, york, westchester, and, boston, railway, which, was, incorporated, into, the, system, in, 1941, as, the, irt, dyre, avenue, line, fourteen, more, stations, were, on, the, abandoned, lirr, rockaway, beach, branch, now, the, ind, rockaway, line, which, opened, in, 1955, two, stations, 57th, street, and, grand, street, were, part, of, the, chrystie, street, connection, and, opened, in, 1968, the, harlem, 148th, street, terminal, opened, that, same, year, in, an, unrelated, project, six, were, built, as, part, of, a, 1968, plan, three, on, the, archer, avenue, lines, opened, in, 1988, and, three, on, the, 63rd, street, lines, opened, in, 1989, the, new, south, ferry, station, was, built, and, connected, to, the, existing, whitehall, street, south, ferry, station, in, 2009, the, one, stop, 7, subway, extension, to, the, west, side, of, manhattan, consisting, of, the, 34th, street, hudson, yards, station, was, opened, in, 2015, and, three, stations, on, the, second, avenue, subway, in, the, upper, east, side, were, opened, as, part, of, phase, 1, of, the, line, at, the, beginning, of, 2017, many, rapid, transit, systems, run, relatively, static, routings, so, that, a, train, line, is, more, or, less, synonymous, with, a, train, route, in, new, york, city, routings, change, often, for, various, reasons, within, the, nomenclature, of, the, subway, the, line, describes, the, physical, railroad, track, or, series, of, tracks, that, a, train, route, uses, on, its, way, from, one, terminal, to, another, routes, also, called, services, are, distinguished, by, a, letter, or, a, number, and, lines, have, names, trains, display, their, route, designation, there, are, 28, train, services, in, the, subway, system, including, three, short, shuttles, each, route, has, a, color, and, a, local, or, express, designation, representing, the, manhattan, trunk, line, of, the, service, new, york, city, residents, seldom, refer, to, services, by, color, e, g, blue, line, or, green, line, but, out, of, towners, and, tourists, often, do, the, 1, c, g, l, m, r, and, w, trains, are, fully, local, and, make, all, stops, the, 2, 3, 4, 5, a, b, d, e, f, n, and, q, trains, have, portions, of, express, and, local, service, j, z, 6, and, 7, trains, vary, by, direction, day, or, time, of, day, the, letter, s, is, used, for, three, shuttle, services, franklin, avenue, shuttle, rockaway, park, shuttle, and, 42nd, street, shuttle, though, the, subway, system, operates, on, a, 24, hour, basis, during, late, night, hours, some, of, the, designated, routes, do, not, run, run, as, a, shorter, route, often, referred, to, as, the, shuttle, train, version, of, its, full, length, counterpart, or, run, with, a, different, stopping, pattern, these, are, usually, indicated, by, smaller, secondary, route, signage, on, station, platforms, because, there, is, no, nightly, system, shutdown, for, maintenance, tracks, and, stations, must, be, maintained, while, the, system, is, operating, this, work, sometimes, necessitates, service, changes, during, midday, overnight, hours, and, weekends, when, parts, of, lines, are, temporarily, shut, down, for, construction, purposes, the, transit, authority, can, substitute, free, shuttle, buses, using, mta, regional, bus, operations, bus, fleet, to, replace, the, routes, that, would, normally, run, on, these, lines, the, transit, authority, announces, planned, service, changes, through, its, website, via, placards, that, are, posted, on, station, and, interior, subway, car, walls, and, through, its, twitter, page, current, official, transit, maps, of, the, new, york, city, subway, are, based, on, a, 1979, design, by, michael, hertz, associates, the, maps, are, not, geographically, accurate, due, to, the, complexity, of, the, system, manhattan, being, the, smallest, borough, but, having, the, most, services, but, they, do, show, major, city, streets, as, an, aid, to, navigation, the, newest, edition, took, effect, on, june, 27, 2010, and, makes, manhattan, bigger, and, staten, island, smaller, with, minor, tweaks, happening, to, the, map, when, more, permanent, changes, occur, earlier, diagrams, of, the, subway, the, first, being, produced, in, 1958, had, the, perception, of, being, more, geographically, inaccurate, than, the, diagrams, today, the, design, of, the, subway, map, by, massimo, vignelli, published, by, the, mta, between, 1972, and, 1979, has, become, a, modern, classic, but, the, mta, deemed, the, map, flawed, due, to, its, placement, of, geographical, elements, a, late, night, only, version, of, the, map, was, introduced, on, january, 30, 2012, on, september, 16, 2011, the, mta, introduced, a, vignelli, style, interactive, subway, map, the, weekender, an, online, map, that, provides, information, about, any, planned, work, from, late, friday, night, to, early, monday, morning, in, october, 2020, the, mta, launched, a, digital, version, of, the, map, showing, real, time, service, patterns, and, service, changes, designed, by, work, co, several, privately, produced, schematics, are, available, online, or, in, printed, form, such, as, those, by, hagstrom, map, out, of, the, 472, stations, 470, are, served, 24, hours, a, day, underground, stations, in, the, new, york, city, subway, are, typically, accessed, by, staircases, going, down, from, street, level, many, of, these, staircases, are, painted, in, a, common, shade, of, green, with, slight, or, significant, variations, in, design, other, stations, have, unique, entrances, reflective, of, their, location, or, date, of, construction, several, station, entrance, stairs, for, example, are, built, into, adjacent, buildings, nearly, all, station, entrances, feature, color, coded, globe, or, square, lamps, signifying, their, status, as, an, entrance, the, current, number, of, stations, is, smaller, than, the, peak, of, the, system, in, addition, to, the, demolition, of, former, elevated, lines, which, collectively, have, resulted, in, the, demolition, of, over, a, hundred, stations, other, closed, stations, and, unused, portions, of, existing, stations, remain, in, parts, of, the, system, many, stations, in, the, subway, system, have, mezzanines, mezzanines, allow, for, passengers, to, enter, from, multiple, locations, at, an, intersection, and, proceed, to, the, correct, platform, without, having, to, cross, the, street, before, entering, inside, mezzanines, are, fare, control, areas, where, passengers, physically, pay, their, fare, to, enter, the, subway, system, in, many, older, stations, the, fare, control, area, is, at, platform, level, with, no, mezzanine, crossovers, many, elevated, stations, also, have, platform, level, fare, control, with, no, common, station, house, between, directions, of, service, upon, entering, a, station, passengers, may, use, station, booths, formerly, known, as, token, booths, or, vending, machines, to, buy, their, fare, which, is, currently, stored, in, a, metrocard, or, omny, card, each, station, has, at, least, one, booth, typically, located, at, the, busiest, entrance, after, swiping, the, card, at, a, turnstile, customers, enter, the, fare, controlled, area, of, the, station, and, continue, to, the, platforms, inside, fare, control, are, off, hours, waiting, areas, which, consist, of, benches, and, are, identified, by, a, yellow, sign, a, typical, subway, station, has, waiting, platforms, ranging, from, 480, to, 600, feet, 150, to, 180, m, long, some, are, longer, platforms, of, former, commuter, rail, stations, such, as, those, on, the, ind, rockaway, line, are, even, longer, with, the, many, different, lines, in, the, system, one, platform, often, serves, more, than, one, service, passengers, need, to, look, at, the, overhead, signs, to, see, which, trains, stop, there, and, when, and, at, the, arriving, train, to, identify, it, there, are, several, common, platform, configurations, on, a, double, track, line, a, station, may, have, one, center, island, platform, used, for, trains, in, both, directions, or, two, side, platforms, one, for, each, direction, for, lines, with, three, or, four, tracks, with, express, service, local, stops, will, have, side, platforms, and, the, middle, one, or, two, tracks, will, not, stop, at, the, station, on, these, lines, express, stations, typically, have, two, island, platforms, one, for, each, direction, each, island, platform, provides, a, cross, platform, interchange, between, local, and, express, services, some, four, track, lines, with, express, service, have, two, tracks, each, on, two, levels, and, use, both, island, and, side, platforms, since, the, majority, of, the, system, was, built, before, 1990, the, year, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, ada, went, into, effect, many, new, york, city, subway, stations, were, not, designed, to, be, accessible, to, all, since, then, elevators, have, been, built, in, newly, constructed, stations, to, comply, with, the, ada, most, grade, level, stations, required, little, modification, to, meet, ada, standards, many, accessible, stations, have, autogate, access, in, addition, the, mta, identified, key, stations, high, traffic, and, or, geographically, important, stations, which, must, conform, to, the, ada, when, they, are, extensively, renovated, under, plans, from, the, mta, in, 2016, the, number, of, ada, accessible, stations, would, go, up, to, 144, by, 2020, as, of, may, 2024, there, were, 145, ada, accessible, stations, over, the, years, the, mta, has, been, involved, in, a, number, of, lawsuits, over, the, lack, of, accessibility, in, its, stations, the, eastern, paralyzed, veterans, association, filed, what, may, have, been, the, first, of, these, suits, in, 1979, based, on, state, law, the, lawsuits, have, relied, on, a, number, of, different, legal, bases, but, most, have, centered, around, the, mta, s, failure, to, include, accessibility, as, a, part, of, its, plans, for, remodeling, various, stations, as, of, january, 2022, ada, accessibility, projects, are, expected, to, be, started, or, completed, at, 51, stations, as, part, of, the, 2020, 2024, capital, program, this, would, allow, one, of, every, two, to, four, stations, on, every, line, to, be, accessible, so, that, all, non, accessible, stops, would, be, a, maximum, of, two, stops, from, an, accessible, station, 39, in, 2022, the, mta, agreed, in, a, settlement, to, make, 95, percent, of, subway, and, staten, island, railway, stations, accessible, by, 2055, by, comparison, all, but, one, of, boston, s, mbta, subway, stations, are, accessible, the, chicago, l, plans, all, stations, to, be, accessible, in, the, 2030s, the, toronto, subway, will, be, fully, accessible, by, 2025, and, montreal, metro, plans, all, stations, to, be, accessible, by, 2038, both, the, boston, and, chicago, systems, are, as, old, or, older, than, the, new, york, city, subway, though, all, of, these, systems, have, fewer, stations, than, the, new, york, city, subway, newer, systems, like, the, washington, metro, and, bay, area, rapid, transit, have, been, fully, accessible, from, their, opening, in, the, 1970s, in, november, 2016, the, new, york, city, subway, had, 6418, cars, on, the, roster, a, typical, new, york, city, subway, train, consists, of, 8, to, 11, cars, although, shuttles, can, have, as, few, as, two, and, the, train, can, range, from, 150, to, 600, feet, 46, to, 183, m, in, length, the, system, maintains, two, separate, fleets, of, cars, one, for, the, a, division, routes, and, another, for, the, b, division, routes, a, division, equipment, is, approximately, 8, feet, 9, inches, 2, 67, m, wide, and, 51, feet, 4, inches, 15, 65, m, long, whereas, b, division, equipment, is, about, 10, feet, 3, 05, m, wide, and, either, 60, feet, 6, inches, 18, 44, m, or, 75, feet, 22, 86, m, long, the, different, lengths, for, the, b, division, fleet, are, necessary, because, 75, foot, cars, can, not, be, used, over, the, bmt, eastern, division, cars, purchased, by, the, city, of, new, york, since, the, inception, of, the, ind, and, the, other, divisions, beginning, in, 1948, are, identified, by, the, letter, r, followed, by, a, number, e, g, r32, this, number, is, the, contract, number, under, which, the, cars, were, purchased, cars, with, nearby, contract, numbers, e, g, r1, through, r9, or, r26, through, r29, or, r143, through, r179, may, be, relatively, identical, despite, being, purchased, under, different, contracts, and, possibly, built, by, different, manufacturers, from, 1999, to, 2019, the, r142, r142a, r143, r160, r179, and, r188, were, placed, into, service, these, cars, are, collectively, known, as, new, technology, trains, ntts, due, to, modern, innovations, such, as, led, and, lcd, route, signs, and, information, screens, as, well, as, recorded, train, announcements, and, the, ability, to, facilitate, communication, based, train, control, cbtc, as, part, of, the, 2017, 2020, mta, financial, plan, 600, subway, cars, will, have, electronic, display, signs, installed, to, improve, customer, experience, riders, pay, a, single, fare, to, enter, the, subway, system, and, may, transfer, between, trains, at, no, extra, cost, until, they, exit, via, station, turnstiles, the, fare, is, a, flat, rate, regardless, of, how, far, or, how, long, the, rider, travels, thus, riders, must, swipe, their, metrocard, or, tap, a, contactless, payment, card, or, smartphone, on, an, omny, reader, upon, entering, the, subway, system, but, not, a, second, time, upon, leaving, as, of, august, 2023, nearly, all, fares, are, paid, by, metrocard, or, omny, as, of, august, 2023, the, base, fare, is, 2, 90, fares, can, be, paid, with, most, credit, or, debit, cards, using, the, omny, readers, with, a, reusable, metrocard, or, with, single, use, tickets, the, mta, offers, 7, day, and, 30, day, unlimited, ride, programs, that, can, lower, the, effective, per, ride, fare, significantly, reduced, fares, are, available, for, the, elderly, and, people, with, disabilities, fares, were, stored, in, a, money, room, at, 370, jay, street, in, downtown, brooklyn, starting, in, 1951, when, the, building, opened, as, a, headquarters, for, the, new, york, city, board, of, transportation, the, building, is, close, to, the, lines, of, all, three, subway, divisions, the, irt, bmt, and, ind, and, thus, was, a, convenient, location, to, collect, fares, including, tokens, and, cash, via, money, trains, passageways, from, the, subway, stations, including, a, visible, door, in, the, jay, street, ind, station, lead, to, a, money, sorting, room, in, the, basement, of, the, building, the, money, trains, were, replaced, by, armored, trucks, in, 2006, in, june, 1993, a, fare, system, called, the, metrocard, was, introduced, which, allows, riders, to, use, magnetic, stripe, cards, that, store, the, value, equal, to, the, amount, paid, to, a, subway, station, booth, clerk, or, vending, machine, the, metrocard, was, enhanced, in, 1997, to, allow, passengers, to, make, free, transfers, between, subways, and, buses, within, two, hours, several, metrocard, only, transfers, between, subway, stations, were, added, in, 2001, with, the, addition, of, unlimited, ride, metrocards, in, 1998, the, new, york, city, transit, system, was, the, last, major, transit, system, in, the, united, states, with, the, exception, of, bart, in, san, francisco, to, introduce, passes, for, unlimited, bus, and, rapid, transit, travel, as, of, 2024, metrocard, is, to, be, retired, at, an, undetermined, date, on, october, 23, 2017, it, was, announced, that, the, metrocard, would, be, phased, out, and, replaced, by, omny, a, contactless, fare, payment, system, by, san, diego, based, cubic, transportation, systems, with, fare, payment, being, made, using, apple, pay, google, pay, debit, credit, cards, with, near, field, communication, technology, or, radio, frequency, identification, cards, as, of, december, 31, 2020, omny, is, available, on, all, mta, buses, and, at, all, subway, stations, since, the, late, 20th, century, the, mta, has, started, several, projects, to, maintain, and, improve, the, subway, in, the, 1990s, it, started, converting, the, bmt, canarsie, line, to, use, communications, based, train, control, utilizing, a, moving, block, signal, system, that, allowed, more, trains, to, use, the, tracks, and, thus, increasing, passenger, capacity, after, the, canarsie, line, tests, were, successful, the, mta, expanded, the, automation, program, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, to, include, other, lines, as, part, of, another, program, called, fastrack, the, mta, started, closing, sections, of, lines, during, weekday, nights, in, 2012, in, order, to, allow, workers, to, clean, these, lines, without, being, hindered, by, train, movements, it, expanded, the, program, beyond, manhattan, the, next, year, after, noticing, how, efficient, the, fastrack, program, was, compared, to, previous, service, diversions, in, 2015, the, mta, announced, a, wide, ranging, improvement, program, as, part, of, the, 2015, 2019, capital, program, thirty, stations, would, be, extensively, rebuilt, under, the, enhanced, station, initiative, and, new, r211, subway, cars, would, be, able, to, fit, more, passengers, the, mta, has, also, started, some, projects, to, improve, passenger, amenities, it, added, train, arrival, countdown, clocks, to, most, a, division, stations, except, on, the, irt, flushing, line, serving, the, 7, and, 7, trains, and, the, bmt, canarsie, line, l, train, by, late, 2011, allowing, passengers, on, these, routes, to, see, train, arrival, times, using, real, time, data, a, similar, countdown, clock, project, for, the, b, division, and, the, flushing, line, was, deferred, until, 2016, when, a, new, bluetooth, based, clock, system, was, tested, successfully, beginning, in, 2011, the, mta, also, started, help, point, to, aid, with, emergency, calls, or, station, agent, assistance, the, help, point, project, was, deemed, successful, and, the, mta, subsequently, installed, help, points, in, all, stations, interactive, touchscreen, on, the, go, travel, station, kiosks, which, give, station, advisories, itineraries, and, timetables, were, installed, starting, in, 2011, with, the, program, also, being, expanded, after, a, successful, pilot, cellular, phone, and, wireless, data, in, stations, first, installed, in, 2011, as, part, of, yet, another, pilot, program, was, also, expanded, systemwide, due, to, positive, passenger, feedback, finally, credit, card, trials, at, several, subway, stations, in, 2006, and, 2010, led, to, proposals, for, contactless, payment, to, replace, the, aging, metrocard, signaling, has, evolved, during, a, century, of, operation, and, mta, uses, a, mixture, of, old, and, new, systems, most, routes, use, block, signaling, but, a, few, routes, are, also, being, retrofitted, with, communications, based, train, control, cbtc, which, would, allow, trains, to, run, without, train, operator, input, the, system, currently, uses, automatic, block, signaling, with, fixed, wayside, signals, and, automatic, train, stops, to, provide, safe, train, operation, across, the, whole, system, the, new, york, city, subway, system, has, for, the, most, part, used, block, signaling, since, its, first, line, opened, and, many, portions, of, the, current, signaling, system, were, installed, between, the, 1930s, and, 1960s, these, signals, work, by, preventing, trains, from, entering, a, block, occupied, by, another, train, typically, the, blocks, are, 1, 000, feet, 300, m, long, red, and, green, lights, show, whether, a, block, is, occupied, or, vacant, the, train, s, maximum, speed, will, depend, on, how, many, blocks, are, open, in, front, of, it, the, signals, do, not, register, a, train, s, speed, nor, where, in, the, block, the, train, is, located, subway, trains, are, stopped, mechanically, at, all, signals, showing, stop, to, make, train, stops, safe, and, effective, wayside, trippers, must, not, be, moved, to, trip, stop, position, until, the, train, has, fully, passed, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, the, mta, began, automating, the, subway, by, installing, cbtc, which, supplements, rather, than, replaces, the, fixed, block, signal, system, it, allows, trains, to, operate, more, closely, together, with, lower, headways, the, bmt, canarsie, line, on, which, the, l, train, runs, was, chosen, for, pilot, testing, because, it, is, a, self, contained, line, that, does, not, operate, in, conjunction, with, other, lines, cbtc, became, operational, in, february, 2009, due, to, an, unexpected, ridership, increase, the, mta, ordered, additional, cars, and, increased, service, from, 15, trains, to, 26, trains, per, hour, an, achievement, beyond, the, capability, of, the, block, system, the, total, cost, of, the, project, was, 340, million, after, the, success, of, the, bmt, canarsie, line, automation, the, irt, flushing, line, carrying, the, 7, and, 7, trains, was, next, chosen, to, get, cbtc, estimated, to, cost, us, 1, 4, billion, the, project, was, completed, in, november, 2018, 11, 12, by, 2018, cbtc, was, in, the, process, of, being, installed, on, several, other, routes, as, well, particularly, the, ind, queens, boulevard, line, e, f, f, m, and, r, trains, and, ind, culver, line, f, f, and, g, trains, the, total, cost, for, the, entire, queens, boulevard, line, is, estimated, at, over, 900, million, and, the, queens, boulevard, cbtc, project, was, completed, in, 2022, funding, for, cbtc, on, the, ind, eighth, avenue, line, is, also, provided, in, the, 2015, 2019, capital, plan, and, the, ind, crosstown, line, and, ind, fulton, street, line, were, also, being, equipped, with, cbtc, as, of, 2022, the, widespread, installation, of, cbtc, includes, retrofitting, many, newer, subway, cars, and, replacement, of, older, cars, eventually, the, mta, has, plans, to, automate, a, much, larger, portion, using, one, person, train, operation, opto, in, conjunction, with, cbtc, at, the, current, pace, of, installation, it, would, take, 175, years, for, cbtc, to, be, installed, at, a, cost, of, 20, billion, the, flushing, line, operated, at, almost, 30, trains, an, hour, using, the, signal, system, installed, when, the, line, was, built, but, after, the, cbtc, installation, it, became, possible, that, an, additional, two, trains, per, hour, could, be, operated, in, march, 2018, new, york, city, transit, authority, president, andy, byford, announced, a, new, plan, for, resignaling, the, subway, with, cbtc, which, would, only, take, 10, to, 15, years, compared, to, the, previous, estimate, of, 40, years, this, would, cost, 8, to, 15, billion, the, new, york, city, subway, uses, a, system, known, as, automatic, train, supervision, ats, for, dispatching, and, train, routing, on, the, a, division, the, flushing, line, and, the, trains, used, on, the, 7, and, 7, services, do, not, have, ats, ats, allows, dispatchers, in, the, operations, control, center, occ, to, see, where, trains, are, in, real, time, and, whether, each, individual, train, is, running, early, or, late, dispatchers, can, hold, trains, for, connections, re, route, trains, or, short, turn, trains, to, provide, better, service, when, a, disruption, causes, delays, despite, the, signal, system, there, have, been, at, least, 64, major, train, accidents, since, 1918, when, a, train, bound, for, south, ferry, collided, with, two, trains, halted, near, jackson, avenue, on, the, irt, white, plains, road, line, in, the, bronx, several, accidents, resulted, when, the, train, operator, ran, through, red, signals, and, rear, ended, the, subway, train, in, front, of, it, this, resulted, from, the, signaling, practice, of, keying, by, which, allowed, train, operators, to, bypass, red, signals, the, deadliest, accident, the, malbone, street, wreck, occurred, on, november, 1, 1918, beneath, the, intersection, of, flatbush, avenue, ocean, avenue, and, malbone, street, the, latter, of, which, is, now, empire, boulevard, near, the, prospect, park, station, of, the, then, brt, brighton, line, in, brooklyn, killing, 93, people, as, a, result, of, accidents, especially, more, recent, ones, such, as, the, 1995, williamsburg, bridge, crash, timer, signals, were, installed, these, signals, have, resulted, in, reduced, speeds, across, the, system, accidents, such, as, derailments, are, also, due, to, broken, equipment, such, as, the, rails, and, the, train, itself, a, portion, of, subway, related, deaths, in, new, york, consists, of, suicides, committed, by, jumping, in, front, of, an, oncoming, train, between, 1990, and, 2003, 343, subway, related, suicides, were, registered, out, of, a, citywide, total, of, 7, 394, 4, 6, and, subway, related, suicides, increased, by, 30, despite, a, decline, in, overall, suicide, numbers, due, to, increase, in, people, hit, by, trains, in, 2013, in, late, 2013, and, early, 2014, the, mta, started, a, test, program, with, four, systems, installed, and, strategies, instituted, to, eliminate, the, number, of, people, hit, by, trains, closed, circuit, television, cameras, a, web, of, laser, beams, stretched, across, the, tracks, radio, frequencies, transmitted, across, the, tracks, and, thermal, imaging, cameras, focused, on, the, station, s, tracks, were, installed, the, tests, were, successful, enough, that, the, 2015, 2019, capital, program, included, similar, installations, system, wide, the, mta, also, expressed, interest, in, starting, a, pilot, program, to, install, platform, edge, doors, several, planned, stations, in, the, new, york, city, subway, may, possibly, feature, platform, screen, doors, including, at, future, stations, such, as, those, part, of, the, second, avenue, subway, in, october, 2017, it, was, announced, that, as, part, of, a, pilot, program, the, third, avenue, station, would, be, refitted, with, platform, screen, doors, during, the, 14th, street, tunnel, shutdown, in, 2019, 2020, the, 30, million, for, the, platform, edge, door, pilot, program, was, diverted, to, another, project, in, 2018, following, a, series, of, incidents, mta, announced, another, psd, pilot, program, at, three, stations, in, february, 2022, the, 7, and, 7, trains, platform, at, times, square, the, e, train, s, platform, at, sutphin, boulevard, archer, avenue, jfk, airport, and, the, third, avenue, station, numerous, challenges, come, with, platform, doors, some, subway, lines, operate, multiple, subway, car, models, and, their, doors, do, not, align, many, platforms, are, not, strong, enough, to, hold, the, additional, weight, of, a, platform, barrier, thus, requiring, extensive, renovations, if, they, were, to, be, installed, crime, rates, have, varied, but, there, was, a, downward, trend, from, the, 1990s, to, 2014, to, fight, crime, various, approaches, have, been, used, over, the, years, including, an, if, you, see, something, say, something, campaign, and, starting, in, 2016, banning, people, who, commit, a, crime, in, the, subway, system, from, entering, the, system, for, a, certain, length, of, time, in, july, 1985, the, citizens, crime, commission, of, new, york, city, published, a, study, showing, riders, abandoning, the, subway, fearing, the, frequent, robberies, and, generally, bad, circumstances, crime, rates, in, the, subway, and, the, city, dropped, in, 1993, part, of, a, larger, citywide, decrease, in, crime, michael, bloomberg, stated, in, a, november, 2004, press, release, today, the, subway, system, is, safer, than, it, has, been, at, any, time, since, we, started, tabulating, subway, crime, statistics, nearly, 40, years, ago, although, ridership, decreased, by, 40, percent, from, 2019, to, 2022, the, number, of, crimes, in, the, system, remained, roughly, the, same, prompting, riders, to, express, concerns, over, increased, crime, the, subway, recorded, eight, murders, in, 2021, the, highest, annual, total, in, 25, years, by, october, 2022, nine, people, had, been, murdered, that, year, alone, the, subway, system, has, been, the, target, of, some, mass, attacks, though, such, attacks, are, relatively, rare, on, december, 11, 2017, there, was, an, attempted, bombing, at, the, times, square, 42nd, street, station, injuring, four, people, including, the, attacker, on, april, 12, 2022, a, shooting, attack, occurred, on, the, n, train, injuring, 29, people, including, 10, who, were, shot, after, the, september, 11, 2001, attacks, the, mta, exercised, extreme, caution, regarding, anyone, taking, photographs, or, recording, video, inside, the, system, and, proposed, banning, all, photography, and, recording, in, a, meeting, around, june, 2004, due, to, strong, response, from, both, the, public, and, from, civil, rights, groups, the, rule, of, conduct, was, dropped, in, november, 2004, the, mta, again, put, this, rule, up, for, approval, but, was, again, denied, though, many, police, officers, and, transit, workers, still, confront, or, harass, people, taking, photographs, or, videos, on, april, 3, 2009, the, nypd, issued, a, directive, to, officers, stating, that, it, is, legal, to, take, pictures, within, the, subway, system, so, long, as, it, is, not, accompanied, with, suspicious, activity, as, of, 2021, the, mta, rules, of, conduct, restricted, areas, and, activities, section, states, that, anyone, may, take, pictures, or, record, videos, provided, that, they, do, not, use, any, of, three, tools, lights, reflectors, or, tripods, these, three, tools, are, permitted, only, by, members, of, the, press, who, have, identification, issued, by, the, nypd, on, july, 22, 2005, in, response, to, bombings, in, london, the, new, york, city, police, department, introduced, a, new, policy, of, randomly, searching, passengers, bags, as, they, approached, turnstiles, the, nypd, claimed, that, no, form, of, racial, profiling, would, be, conducted, when, these, searches, actually, took, place, the, nypd, has, come, under, fire, from, some, groups, that, claim, purely, random, searches, without, any, form, of, threat, assessment, would, be, ineffectual, donna, lieberman, executive, director, of, the, nyclu, stated, this, nypd, bag, search, policy, is, unprecedented, unlawful, and, ineffective, it, is, essential, that, police, be, aggressive, in, maintaining, security, in, public, transportation, but, our, very, real, concerns, about, terrorism, do, not, justify, the, nypd, subjecting, millions, of, innocent, people, to, suspicionless, searches, in, a, way, that, does, not, identify, any, person, seeking, to, engage, in, terrorist, activity, and, is, unlikely, to, have, any, meaningful, deterrent, effect, on, terrorist, activity, the, searches, were, upheld, by, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, second, circuit, in, macwade, v, kelly, on, april, 11, 2008, mta, received, a, ferrara, fire, apparatus, hazardous, materials, response, truck, which, went, into, service, three, days, later, it, will, be, used, in, the, case, of, a, chemical, or, bioterrorist, attack, najibullah, zazi, and, others, were, arrested, in, september, 2009, and, pleaded, guilty, in, 2010, to, being, part, of, an, al, qaeda, plan, to, undertake, suicide, bombings, on, the, new, york, city, subway, system, the, mta, faced, a, budget, deficit, of, us, 1, 2, billion, in, 2009, this, resulted, in, fare, increases, three, times, from, 2008, to, 2010, and, service, reductions, including, the, elimination, of, two, part, time, subway, services, the, v, and, w, several, other, routes, were, modified, due, to, the, deficit, the, n, was, made, a, full, time, local, in, manhattan, in, contrast, to, being, a, weekend, local, weekday, express, before, 2010, while, the, q, was, extended, nine, stations, north, to, astoria, ditmars, boulevard, on, weekdays, both, to, cover, the, discontinued, w, the, m, was, combined, with, the, v, routing, it, over, the, chrystie, street, connection, ind, sixth, avenue, line, and, ind, queens, boulevard, line, to, forest, hills, 71st, avenue, on, weekdays, instead, of, via, the, bmt, fourth, avenue, line, and, bmt, west, end, line, to, bay, parkway, the, g, was, truncated, to, court, square, full, time, construction, headways, on, eleven, routes, were, lengthened, and, off, peak, service, was, lengthened, on, seven, routes, in, june, 2017, governor, andrew, cuomo, signed, an, executive, order, declaring, a, state, of, emergency, for, the, new, york, city, subway, after, a, series, of, derailments, track, fires, and, overcrowding, incidents, on, june, 27, 2017, thirty, nine, people, were, injured, when, an, a, train, derailed, at, 125th, street, damaging, tracks, and, signals, then, catching, fire, on, july, 21, 2017, the, second, set, of, wheels, on, a, southbound, q, train, jumped, the, track, near, brighton, beach, with, nine, people, suffering, injuries, due, to, improper, maintenance, of, the, car, in, question, to, solve, the, system, s, problems, the, mta, officially, announced, the, genius, transit, challenge, on, june, 28, where, contestants, could, submit, ideas, to, improve, signals, communications, infrastructure, or, rolling, stock, on, july, 25, 2017, chairman, joe, lhota, announced, a, two, phase, 9, billion, new, york, city, subway, action, plan, to, stabilize, the, subway, system, and, to, prevent, the, continuing, decline, of, the, system, the, first, phase, costing, 836, million, consisted, of, five, categories, of, improvements, in, signal, and, track, maintenance, car, reliability, system, safety, and, cleanliness, customer, communication, and, critical, management, group, the, 8, billion, second, phase, would, implement, the, winning, proposals, from, the, genius, transit, challenge, and, fix, more, widespread, problems, six, winning, submissions, for, the, genius, transit, challenge, were, announced, in, march, 2018, in, october, 2017, city, comptroller, scott, stringer, released, an, analysis, that, subway, delays, could, cost, up, to, 389, million, or, 243, 1, million, or, 170, 2, million, per, year, depending, on, the, length, of, the, delays, in, november, 2017, the, new, york, times, published, its, investigation, into, the, crisis, it, found, that, the, crisis, had, arisen, as, a, result, of, financially, unsound, decisions, by, local, and, state, politicians, from, both, the, democratic, and, republican, parties, according, to, the, times, these, decisions, included, overspending, overpaying, unions, and, interest, groups, advertising, superficial, improvement, projects, while, ignoring, more, important, infrastructure, and, agreeing, to, high, interest, loans, that, would, have, been, unnecessary, without, these, politicians, other, interventions, by, this, time, the, subway, s, 65, average, on, time, performance, was, the, lowest, among, all, major, cities, transit, systems, and, every, non, shuttle, subway, route, s, on, time, performance, had, declined, in, the, previous, ten, years, the, state, of, emergency, ended, on, june, 30, 2021, after, previously, being, renewed, 49, times, as, of, october, 2021, on, time, performance, across, all, routes, is, at, 80, 6, percent, worsening, subway, reliability, and, service, cuts, in, the, early, 2020s, have, been, attributed, to, chronic, mismanagement, at, the, agency, and, a, botched, restructuring, plan, that, was, implemented, under, former, governor, andrew, cuomo, several, subway, lines, have, reached, their, operational, limits, in, terms, of, train, frequency, and, passengers, according, to, data, released, by, the, transit, authority, by, 2007, the, e, l, and, all, a, division, services, except, the, 42nd, street, shuttle, were, beyond, capacity, as, well, as, portions, of, the, n, train, in, april, 2013, new, york, magazine, reported, that, the, system, was, more, crowded, than, it, had, been, in, the, previous, 66, years, the, subway, reached, a, daily, ridership, of, 6, million, for, 29, days, in, 2014, and, was, expected, to, record, a, similar, ridership, level, for, 55, days, in, 2015, by, comparison, in, 2013, daily, ridership, never, reached, 6, million, in, particular, the, express, tracks, of, the, irt, lexington, avenue, line, and, ind, queens, boulevard, line, are, noted, for, operating, at, full, capacity, during, peak, hours, the, long, island, rail, road, east, side, access, project, which, opened, in, january, 2023, was, expected, to, bring, many, more, commuters, to, the, lexington, avenue, line, the, second, avenue, subway, was, built, to, relieve, pressure, on, the, lexington, avenue, line, 4, 5, 6, and, 6, trains, by, shifting, an, estimated, 225, 000, passengers, following, the, onset, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, new, york, city, in, 2020, there, was, enough, of, a, ridership, decrease, that, these, routes, were, no, longer, crammed, to, capacity, during, rush, hours, although, they, still, experienced, some, crowding, by, early, 2016, delays, as, a, result, of, overcrowding, were, up, to, more, than, 20, 000, every, month, four, times, the, amount, in, 2012, the, overcrowded, trains, have, resulted, in, an, increase, of, assaults, with, less, platform, space, more, passengers, are, forced, to, be, on, the, edge, of, the, platform, resulting, in, the, increased, possibility, of, passengers, falling, on, the, track, the, mta, is, considering, platform, screen, doors, which, exist, on, the, airtrain, jfk, to, prevent, passengers, falling, onto, the, tracks, as, of, february, 2022, platform, screen, doors, were, planned, to, be, installed, in, three, stations, following, an, increase, in, people, being, pushed, onto, the, tracks, the, mta, has, sought, to, relieve, overcrowding, by, upgrading, signaling, systems, on, some, lines, to, use, communications, based, train, control, cbtc, installation, on, the, flushing, line, is, expected, to, increase, the, rate, of, trains, per, hour, on, the, 7, and, 7, trains, but, little, relief, will, come, to, other, crowded, lines, until, later, the, l, train, which, is, overcrowded, during, rush, hours, already, has, cbtc, operation, the, installation, of, cbtc, has, reduced, the, l, s, running, time, by, 3, even, with, cbtc, there, are, limits, on, the, potential, increased, service, for, l, service, to, be, increased, further, a, power, upgrade, as, well, as, additional, space, for, the, l, to, turn, around, at, its, manhattan, terminus, eighth, avenue, are, needed, due, to, an, increase, of, ridership, the, mta, has, tried, to, increase, capacity, wherever, possible, by, adding, more, frequent, service, specifically, during, the, evening, hours, this, increase, is, not, likely, to, keep, up, with, the, growth, of, subway, ridership, some, lines, have, capacity, for, additional, trains, during, peak, times, but, there, are, too, few, subway, cars, for, this, additional, service, to, be, operated, as, part, of, the, r211, subway, car, order, the, mta, is, planning, to, test, a, train, of, 10, open, gangway, experimental, prototype, cars, which, could, increase, capacity, by, up, to, 10, by, utilizing, space, between, cars, the, order, could, be, expanded, to, include, up, to, 750, open, gangway, cars, the, mta, is, also, testing, smaller, ideas, on, some, services, starting, in, late, 2015, 100, station, platform, controllers, were, deployed, for, the, f, 6, and, 7, trains, to, manage, the, flow, of, passengers, on, and, off, crowded, trains, during, morning, rush, hours, there, were, a, total, of, 129, such, employees, who, also, answer, passengers, questions, about, subway, directions, rather, than, having, conductors, answer, them, and, thus, delaying, the, trains, in, early, 2017, the, test, was, expanded, to, the, afternoon, peak, period, with, an, increase, of, 35, platform, conductors, in, november, of, the, same, year, 140, platform, controllers, and, 90, conductors, gained, iphone, 6s, devices, so, they, could, receive, notifications, of, and, tell, riders, about, subway, disruptions, subway, guards, the, predecessors, to, the, platform, controllers, were, first, used, during, the, great, depression, and, world, war, ii, shortened, next, stop, announcements, on, trains, were, being, tested, on, the, 2, and, 5, trains, step, aside, signs, on, the, platforms, reminding, boarding, passengers, to, let, departing, passengers, off, the, train, first, were, tested, at, grand, central, 42nd, street, 51st, street, and, 86th, street, on, the, lexington, avenue, line, cameras, would, also, be, installed, so, the, mta, could, observe, passenger, overcrowding, in, systems, like, the, london, underground, stations, are, simply, closed, off, when, they, are, overcrowded, that, type, of, restriction, is, not, necessary, yet, on, the, new, york, city, subway, according, to, mta, spokesman, kevin, ortiz, service, on, the, subway, system, is, occasionally, disrupted, by, flooding, from, rainstorms, even, minor, ones, rainwater, can, disrupt, signals, underground, and, require, the, electrified, third, rail, to, be, shut, off, every, day, the, mta, moves, 13, million, gallons, of, water, when, it, is, not, raining, the, pumps, and, drainage, system, can, handle, a, rainfall, rate, of, 1, 75, inches, 44, mm, per, hour, 10, since, 1992, 357, million, has, been, used, to, improve, 269, pump, rooms, by, august, 2007, 115, million, was, earmarked, to, upgrade, the, remaining, 18, pump, rooms, despite, these, improvements, the, transit, system, continues, to, experience, flooding, problems, on, august, 8, 2007, after, more, than, 3, inches, 76, mm, of, rain, fell, within, an, hour, the, subway, system, flooded, causing, almost, every, subway, service, to, either, be, disabled, or, seriously, disrupted, effectively, halting, the, morning, rush, on, september, 1, 2021, when, 3, to, 5, inches, 76, to, 127, mm, of, rain, per, hour, fell, during, hurricane, ida, service, on, the, entire, subway, system, was, suspended, as, part, of, a, 130, million, and, an, estimated, 18, month, project, the, mta, began, installing, new, subway, grates, in, september, 2008, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, rain, from, overflowing, into, the, subway, system, the, metallic, structures, designed, with, the, help, of, architectural, firms, and, meant, as, a, piece, of, public, art, are, placed, atop, existing, grates, but, with, a, 3, to, 4, inch, 76, to, 102, mm, sleeve, to, prevent, debris, and, rain, from, flooding, the, subway, the, racks, will, at, first, be, installed, in, the, three, most, flood, prone, areas, as, determined, by, hydrologists, jamaica, tribeca, and, the, upper, west, side, each, neighborhood, has, its, own, distinct, design, some, featuring, a, wave, like, deck, which, increases, in, height, and, features, seating, as, in, jamaica, others, with, a, flatter, deck, that, includes, seating, and, a, bike, rack, in, october, 2012, hurricane, sandy, caused, significant, damage, to, new, york, city, and, many, subway, tunnels, were, inundated, with, floodwater, the, subway, opened, with, limited, service, two, days, after, the, storm, and, was, running, at, 80, percent, capacity, within, five, days, some, infrastructure, needed, years, to, repair, a, year, after, the, storm, mta, spokesperson, kevin, ortiz, said, this, was, unprecedented, in, terms, of, the, amount, of, damage, that, we, were, seeing, throughout, the, system, the, storm, flooded, nine, of, the, system, s, 14, underwater, tunnels, many, subway, lines, and, several, subway, yards, as, well, as, completely, destroying, a, portion, of, the, ind, rockaway, line, and, much, of, the, south, ferry, terminal, station, reconstruction, required, many, partial, or, total, closures, on, several, lines, and, tunnels, heavy, flooding, also, occurred, in, september, 2021, during, hurricane, ida, and, in, september, 2023, during, the, aftermath, of, tropical, storm, ophelia, before, 2011, there, have, been, some, full, subway, closures, for, transit, strikes, january, 1, 13, 1966, april, 1, 11, 1980, december, 20, 22, 2005, and, blackouts, november, 9, 10, 1965, july, 13, 14, 1977, august, 14, 16, 2003, on, august, 27, 2011, due, to, the, approach, of, hurricane, irene, the, mta, suspended, subway, service, at, noon, in, anticipation, of, heavy, flooding, on, tracks, and, in, tunnels, it, was, the, first, weather, caused, shutdown, in, the, history, of, the, system, service, was, restored, by, august, 29, on, october, 29, 2012, a, full, closure, was, ordered, before, the, arrival, of, hurricane, sandy, all, services, on, the, subway, the, long, island, rail, road, and, metro, north, were, gradually, shut, down, by, 7, 00, p, m, to, protect, passengers, employees, and, equipment, from, the, coming, storm, the, storm, caused, serious, damage, to, the, system, especially, the, ind, rockaway, line, upon, which, many, sections, between, howard, beach, jfk, airport, and, hammels, wye, on, the, rockaway, peninsula, were, heavily, damaged, leaving, it, essentially, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, system, this, required, the, nycta, to, truck, in, 20, r32, subway, cars, to, the, line, to, provide, some, interim, service, temporarily, designated, the, h, also, several, of, the, system, s, tunnels, under, the, east, river, were, flooded, by, the, storm, surge, south, ferry, suffered, serious, water, damage, and, did, not, reopen, until, april, 4, 2013, by, restoring, service, to, the, older, loop, configured, station, that, had, been, replaced, in, 2009, the, stub, end, terminal, tracks, remained, out, of, service, until, june, 2017, since, 2015, there, have, been, several, blizzard, related, subway, shutdowns, on, january, 26, 2015, another, full, closure, was, ordered, by, new, york, governor, andrew, cuomo, due, to, the, january, 2015, nor, easter, originally, projected, to, leave, new, york, city, with, 20, to, 30, inches, 51, to, 76, cm, of, snow, this, was, the, first, shutdown, in, the, system, s, history, to, be, ordered, due, to, snow, the, next, day, the, subway, system, was, partially, reopened, several, residents, criticized, the, decision, to, shut, down, the, subway, system, due, to, snow, as, the, nor, easter, dropped, much, less, snow, in, the, city, than, originally, expected, totaling, only, 9, 8, inches, 25, cm, in, central, park, for, subsequent, snowstorms, the, mta, published, a, winter, underground, only, subway, service, plan, when, this, plan, is, in, effect, all, above, ground, stations, would, be, closed, and, all, above, ground, service, suspended, except, at, 125th, street, and, broadway, where, 1, trains, would, run, above, ground, but, skip, the, station, underground, service, would, remain, operational, except, at, a, small, number, of, stations, that, would, be, closed, because, of, their, proximity, to, above, ground, portions, of, the, system, this, plan, was, first, used, on, january, 23, 2016, during, the, january, 2016, united, states, blizzard, it, was, also, used, on, march, 14, 2017, due, to, the, march, 2017, nor, easter, on, august, 4, 2020, service, at, above, ground, stations, was, suspended, due, to, the, high, wind, gusts, brought, by, tropical, storm, isaias, starting, on, may, 6, 2020, as, a, result, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, new, york, city, stations, were, closed, between, 1, 00, a, m, and, 5, 00, a, m, for, cleaning, and, disinfecting, nevertheless, over, 500, trains, continued, running, every, 20, minutes, between, 1, a, m, and, 5, a, m, carrying, only, transit, workers, and, emergency, personnel, the, trains, kept, running, because, there, was, not, enough, space, in, the, system, to, store, all, trains, simultaneously, and, also, so, that, they, could, easily, resume, service, upon, the, start, of, rush, hour, at, 5, a, m, in, february, 2021, the, overnight, closures, were, shortened, to, between, 2, and, 4, a, m, and, in, may, 2021, cuomo, announced, that, 24, hour, service, would, resume, on, may, 17, this, was, the, longest, shutdown, in, the, subway, s, history, litter, accumulation, in, the, subway, system, is, perennial, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, dirty, trains, and, platforms, as, well, as, graffiti, were, a, serious, problem, the, situation, had, improved, since, then, but, the, 2010, budget, crisis, which, caused, over, 100, of, the, cleaning, staff, to, lose, their, jobs, threatened, to, curtail, trash, removal, every, day, the, mta, removes, 40, tons, of, trash, from, 3, 500, trash,

they, are, believed, to, pose, a, health, hazard, and, on, rare, instances, have, been, known, to, bite, humans, subway, stations, notorious, for, rat, infestation, include, chambers, street, jay, street, metrotech, west, fourth, street, spring, street, and, 145th, street, decades, of, efforts, to, eradicate, or, simply, thin, the, rat, population, in, the, system, have, been, a, failure, in, march, 2009, the, transit, authority, announced, a, series, of, changes, to, its, vermin, control, strategy, including, new, poison, formulas, and, experimental, trap, designs, in, october, 2011, they, announced, a, new, initiative, to, clean, 25, subway, stations, along, with, their, garbage, rooms, of, rat, infestations, that, same, month, the, mta, announced, a, pilot, program, aimed, at, reducing, levels, of, garbage, in, the, subways, by, removing, all, garbage, bins, from, the, subway, platforms, the, initiative, was, tested, at, the, eighth, street, new, york, university, and, flushing, main, street, stations, as, of, march, 2016, stations, along, the, bmt, jamaica, line, bmt, myrtle, avenue, line, and, various, other, stations, had, their, garbage, cans, removed, due, to, the, success, of, the, program, in, march, 2017, the, program, was, ended, as, a, failure, the, old, vacuum, trains, that, are, designed, to, remove, trash, from, the, tracks, are, ineffective, and, often, broken, a, 2016, study, by, travel, math, had, the, new, york, city, subway, listed, as, the, dirtiest, subway, system, in, the, country, based, on, the, number, of, viable, bacteria, cells, in, august, 2016, the, mta, announced, that, it, had, initiated, operation, track, sweep, an, aggressive, plan, to, dramatically, reduce, the, amount, of, trash, on, the, tracks, and, in, the, subway, environment, this, was, expected, to, reduce, track, fires, and, train, delays, as, part, of, the, plan, the, frequency, of, station, track, cleaning, would, be, increased, and, 94, stations, would, be, cleaned, per, two, week, period, an, increase, from, the, previous, rate, of, 34, stations, every, two, weeks, the, mta, launched, an, intensive, two, week, system, wide, cleaning, on, september, 12, 2016, several, vacuum, trains, were, delivered, in, 2018, and, 2019, the, operation, planned, to, also, include, 27, new, refuse, cars, rolling, stock, on, the, new, york, city, subway, produces,

public, health, found, noise, levels, averaged, 95, decibel, db, inside, subway, cars, and, 94, db, on, platforms, daily, exposure, to, noise, at, such, levels, for, as, little, as, 30, minutes, can, lead, to, hearing, loss, noise, on, one, in, 10, platforms, exceeded, 100, db, under, who, and, epa, guidelines, noise, exposure, at, that, level, is, limited, to, 1, 5, minutes, a, subsequent, study, by, columbia, and, the, university, of, washington, found, higher, average, noise, levels, in, the, subway, 80, 4, db, than, on, commuter, trains, including, port, authority, trans, hudson, path, 79, 4, db, metro, north, 75, 1, db, and, long, island, rail, road, lirr, 74, 9, db, since, the, decibel, scale, is, a, logarithmic, scale, sound, at, 95, db, is, 10, times, more, intense, than, at, 85,
