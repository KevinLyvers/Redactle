the, shinkansen, japanese, lit, new, main, line, colloquially, known, in, english, as, the, bullet, train, is, a, network, of, high, speed, railway, lines, in, japan, initially, it, was, built, to, connect, distant, japanese, regions, with, tokyo, the, capital, to, aid, economic, growth, and, development, beyond, long, distance, travel, some, sections, around, the, largest, metropolitan, areas, are, used, as, a, commuter, rail, network, it, is, owned, by, the, japan, railway, construction, transport, and, technology, agency, and, operated, by, five, japan, railways, group, companies, starting, with, the, tokaido, shinkansen, 515, 4, km, 320, 3, mi, in, 1964, the, network, has, expanded, to, currently, consist, of, 2, 951, 3, km, 1, 833, 9, mi, of, lines, with, maximum, speeds, of, 260, 320, km, h, 160, 200, mph, 283, 5, km, 176, 2, mi, of, mini, shinkansen, lines, with, a, maximum, speed, of, 130, km, h, 80, mph, and, 10, 3, km, 6, 4, mi, of, spur, lines, with, shinkansen, services, the, network, presently, links, most, major, cities, on, the, islands, of, honshu, and, kyushu, and, hakodate, on, the, northern, island, of, hokkaido, with, an, extension, to, sapporo, under, construction, and, scheduled, to, commence, in, march, 2031, the, maximum, operating, speed, is, 320, km, h, 200, mph, on, a, 387, 5, km, 241, mi, section, of, the, t, hoku, shinkansen, test, runs, have, reached, 443, km, h, 275, mph, for, conventional, rail, in, 1996, and, up, to, a, world, record, 603, km, h, 375, mph, for, scmaglev, trains, in, april, 2015, the, original, tokaido, shinkansen, connecting, tokyo, nagoya, and, osaka, three, of, japan, s, largest, cities, is, one, of, the, world, s, busiest, high, speed, rail, lines, in, the, one, year, period, preceding, march, 2017, it, carried, 159, million, passengers, and, since, its, opening, more, than, five, decades, ago, it, has, transported, more, than, 6, 4, billion, total, passengers, at, peak, times, the, line, carries, up, to, 16, trains, per, hour, in, each, direction, with, 16, cars, each, 1, 323, seat, capacity, and, occasionally, additional, standing, passengers, with, a, minimum, headway, of, three, minutes, between, trains, the, shinkansen, network, of, japan, had, the, highest, annual, passenger, ridership, a, maximum, of, 353, million, in, 2007, of, any, high, speed, rail, network, until, 2011, when, the, chinese, high, speed, railway, network, surpassed, it, at, 370, million, passengers, annually, reaching, over, 2, 3, billion, annual, passengers, in, 2019, shinkansen, in, japanese, means, new, trunk, line, or, new, main, line, but, this, word, is, used, to, describe, both, the, railway, lines, the, trains, run, on, and, the, trains, themselves, in, english, the, trains, are, also, known, as, the, bullet, train, the, term, bullet, train, dangan, ressha, originates, from, 1939, and, was, the, initial, name, given, to, the, shinkansen, project, in, its, earliest, planning, stages, furthermore, the, name, superexpress, ch, tokky, used, exclusively, until, 1972, for, hikari, trains, on, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, is, used, today, in, english, language, announcements, and, signage, japan, was, the, first, country, to, build, dedicated, railway, lines, for, high, speed, travel, because, of, the, mountainous, terrain, the, existing, network, consisted, of, 1, 067, mm, 3, ft, 6, in, narrow, gauge, lines, which, generally, took, indirect, routes, and, could, not, be, adapted, to, higher, speeds, due, to, technical, limitations, of, narrow, gauge, rail, for, example, if, a, standard, gauge, rail, has, a, curve, with, a, maximum, speed, of, 145, km, h, 90, mph, the, same, curve, on, narrow, gauge, rail, will, have, a, maximum, allowable, speed, of, 130, km, h, 81, mph, consequently, japan, had, a, greater, need, for, new, high, speed, lines, than, countries, where, the, existing, standard, gauge, or, broad, gauge, rail, system, had, more, upgrade, potential, among, the, key, people, credited, with, the, construction, of, the, first, shinkansen, are, hideo, shima, the, chief, engineer, and, shinji, sog, the, first, president, of, japanese, national, railways, jnr, who, managed, to, persuade, politicians, to, back, the, plan, other, significant, people, responsible, for, its, technical, development, were, tadanao, miki, tadashi, matsudaira, and, hajime, kawanabe, based, at, the, railway, technical, research, institute, rtri, part, of, jnr, they, were, responsible, for, much, of, the, technical, development, of, the, first, line, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, all, three, had, worked, on, aircraft, design, during, world, war, ii, the, popular, english, name, bullet, train, is, a, literal, translation, of, the, japanese, term, dangan, ressha, a, nickname, given, to, the, project, while, it, was, initially, discussed, in, the, 1930s, the, name, stuck, because, of, the, original, 0, series, shinkansen, s, resemblance, to, a, bullet, and, its, high, speed, the, shinkansen, name, was, first, formally, used, in, 1940, for, a, proposed, standard, gauge, passenger, and, freight, line, between, tokyo, and, shimonoseki, that, would, have, used, steam, and, electric, locomotives, with, a, top, speed, of, 200, km, h, 120, mph, over, the, next, three, years, the, ministry, of, railways, drew, up, more, ambitious, plans, to, extend, the, line, to, beijing, through, a, tunnel, to, korea, and, even, singapore, and, build, connections, to, the, trans, siberian, railway, and, other, trunk, lines, in, asia, these, plans, were, abandoned, in, 1943, as, japan, s, position, in, world, war, ii, worsened, however, some, construction, did, commence, on, the, line, several, tunnels, on, the, present, day, shinkansen, date, to, the, war, era, project, following, the, end, of, world, war, ii, high, speed, rail, was, forgotten, for, several, years, while, traffic, of, passengers, and, freight, steadily, increased, on, the, conventional, t, kaid, main, line, along, with, the, reconstruction, of, japanese, industry, and, economy, by, the, mid, 1950s, the, t, kaid, line, was, operating, at, full, capacity, and, the, ministry, of, railways, decided, to, revisit, the, shinkansen, project, in, 1957, odakyu, electric, railway, introduced, its, 3000, series, se, romancecar, train, setting, a, world, speed, record, of, 145, km, h, 90, mph, for, a, narrow, gauge, train, this, train, gave, designers, the, confidence, that, they, could, safely, build, an, even, faster, standard, gauge, train, thus, the, first, shinkansen, the, 0, series, was, built, on, the, success, of, the, romancecar, in, the, 1950s, the, japanese, national, attitude, was, that, as, was, happening, in, the, united, states, railways, would, soon, be, outdated, and, replaced, by, air, travel, and, highways, however, shinji, sog, president, of, japanese, national, railways, insisted, strongly, on, the, possibility, of, high, speed, rail, and, the, shinkansen, project, was, implemented, government, approval, came, in, december, 1958, and, construction, of, the, first, segment, of, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, between, tokyo, and, osaka, started, in, april, 1959, the, cost, of, constructing, the, shinkansen, was, at, first, estimated, at, nearly, 200, billion, yen, which, was, raised, in, the, form, of, a, government, loan, railway, bonds, and, a, low, interest, loan, of, us, 80, million, from, the, world, bank, initial, estimates, however, were, understated, and, the, actual, cost, was, about, 380, billion, yen, as, the, budget, shortfall, became, clear, in, 1963, sogo, resigned, to, take, responsibility, a, test, facility, for, rolling, stock, called, the, kamonomiya, model, section, opened, in, odawara, in, 1962, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, began, service, on, 1, october, 1964, in, time, for, the, first, tokyo, olympics, the, conventional, limited, express, service, took, six, hours, and, 40, minutes, from, tokyo, to, osaka, but, the, shinkansen, made, the, trip, in, just, four, hours, shortened, to, three, hours, and, ten, minutes, by, 1965, it, enabled, day, trips, between, tokyo, and, osaka, the, two, largest, metropolises, in, japan, significantly, changed, the, style, of, business, and, life, of, the, japanese, people, and, increased, new, traffic, demand, the, service, was, an, immediate, success, reaching, the, 100, million, passenger, mark, in, less, than, three, years, on, 13, july, 1967, and, one, billion, passengers, in, 1976, sixteen, car, trains, were, introduced, for, expo, 70, in, osaka, with, an, average, of, 23, 000, passengers, per, hour, in, each, direction, in, 1992, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, was, the, world, s, busiest, high, speed, rail, line, as, of, 2014, the, train, s, 50th, anniversary, daily, passenger, traffic, rose, to, 391, 000, which, spread, over, its, 18, hour, schedule, represented, an, average, of, just, under, 22, 000, passengers, per, hour, the, first, shinkansen, trains, the, 0, series, ran, at, speeds, of, up, to, 210, km, h, 130, mph, later, increased, to, 220, km, h, 137, mph, the, last, of, these, trains, with, their, classic, bullet, nosed, appearance, were, retired, on, 30, november, 2008, a, driving, car, from, one, of, the, 0, series, trains, was, donated, by, jr, west, to, the, national, railway, museum, in, york, united, kingdom, in, 2001, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, s, rapid, success, prompted, an, extension, westward, to, okayama, hiroshima, and, fukuoka, the, san, y, shinkansen, which, was, completed, in, 1975, prime, minister, kakuei, tanaka, was, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, shinkansen, and, his, government, proposed, an, extensive, network, paralleling, most, existing, trunk, lines, two, new, lines, the, t, hoku, shinkansen, and, j, etsu, shinkansen, were, built, following, this, plan, many, other, planned, lines, were, delayed, or, scrapped, entirely, as, jnr, slid, into, debt, throughout, the, late, 1970s, largely, because, of, the, high, cost, of, building, the, shinkansen, network, by, the, early, 1980s, the, company, was, practically, insolvent, leading, to, its, privatization, in, 1987, development, of, the, shinkansen, by, the, privatised, regional, jr, companies, has, continued, with, new, train, models, developed, each, generally, with, its, own, distinctive, appearance, such, as, the, 500, series, introduced, by, jr, west, since, 2014, shinkansen, trains, run, regularly, at, speeds, up, to, 320, km, h, 200, mph, on, the, t, hoku, shinkansen, only, the, shanghai, maglev, train, china, railway, high, speed, networks, and, the, indonesian, jakarta, bandung, high, speed, railway, have, commercial, services, that, operate, faster, since, 1970, development, has, also, been, underway, for, the, ch, shinkansen, a, planned, maglev, line, from, tokyo, to, osaka, on, 21, april, 2015, a, seven, car, l0, series, maglev, trainset, set, a, world, speed, record, of, 603, km, h, 375, mph, to, enable, high, speed, operation, shinkansen, uses, a, range, of, advanced, technology, compared, with, conventional, rail, achieving, not, only, high, speed, but, also, a, high, standard, of, safety, and, comfort, its, success, has, influenced, other, railways, in, the, world, demonstrating, the, importance, and, advantages, of, high, speed, rail, shinkansen, routes, never, intersect, with, slower, narrow, gauge, conventional, lines, except, mini, shinkansen, which, runs, along, these, older, lines, consequently, the, shinkansen, is, not, affected, by, slower, local, or, freight, trains, except, for, hokkaido, shinkansen, while, traveling, through, the, seikan, tunnel, and, has, the, capacity, to, operate, many, high, speed, trains, punctually, in, addition, shinkansen, routes, excluding, mini, shinkansen, are, completely, grade, separated, from, roads, and, highways, meaning, railway, crossings, are, almost, eliminated, tracks, are, strictly, off, limits, with, penalties, against, trespassing, strictly, regulated, by, law, the, routes, use, tunnels, and, viaducts, to, go, through, and, over, obstacles, rather, than, around, them, with, a, minimum, curve, radius, of, 4, 000, m, 13, 123, ft, 2, 500, m, 8, 202, ft, on, the, oldest, t, kaid, shinkansen, the, shinkansen, uses, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, standard, gauge, in, contrast, to, the, 1, 067, mm, 3, ft, 6, in, narrow, gauge, of, most, other, lines, in, japan, continuous, welded, rail, and, swingnose, crossing, points, are, employed, eliminating, gaps, at, turnouts, and, crossings, long, rails, are, used, joined, by, expansion, joints, to, minimize, gauge, fluctuation, due, to, thermal, elongation, and, shrinkage, a, combination, of, ballasted, and, slab, track, is, used, with, slab, track, exclusively, employed, on, concrete, bed, sections, such, as, viaducts, and, tunnels, slab, track, is, significantly, more, cost, effective, in, tunnel, sections, since, the, lower, track, height, reduces, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, tunnel, reducing, construction, costs, up, to, 30, however, the, smaller, diameter, of, shinkansen, tunnels, compared, to, some, other, high, speed, lines, has, resulted, in, the, issue, of, tunnel, boom, becoming, a, concern, for, residents, living, close, to, tunnel, portals, the, slab, track, consists, of, rails, fasteners, and, track, slabs, with, a, cement, asphalt, mortar, on, the, roadbed, and, in, tunnels, circular, upstands, measuring, 400, 520, mm, 16, 20, inches, in, diameter, and, 200, mm, 7, 9, inches, high, are, located, at, 5, metre, intervals, the, prefabricated, upstands, are, made, of, either, reinforced, concrete, or, pre, stressed, reinforced, concrete, they, prevent, the, track, slab, from, moving, latitudinally, or, longitudinally, one, track, slab, weighs, approximately, 5, tons, and, is, 2, 220, 2, 340, mm, 87, 92, inches, wide, 4, 900, 4, 950, mm, 193, 195, inches, long, and, 160, 200, mm, 6, 3, 7, 9, inches, thick, the, shinkansen, employs, an, atc, automatic, train, control, system, eliminating, the, need, for, trackside, signals, it, uses, a, comprehensive, system, of, automatic, train, protection, centralized, traffic, control, manages, all, train, operations, and, all, tasks, relating, to, train, movement, track, station, and, schedule, are, networked, and, computerized, shinkansen, uses, a, 25, kv, ac, overhead, power, supply, 20, kv, ac, on, mini, shinkansen, lines, to, overcome, the, limitations, of, the, 1, 500, v, direct, current, used, on, the, existing, electrified, narrow, gauge, system, power, is, distributed, along, the, train, s, axles, to, reduce, the, heavy, axle, loads, under, single, power, cars, the, ac, frequency, of, the, power, supply, for, the, tokaido, shinkansen, is, 60, hz, shinkansen, trains, are, electric, multiple, units, emus, offering, fast, acceleration, deceleration, and, reduced, damage, to, the, track, because, of, the, use, of, lighter, vehicles, compared, to, locomotives, or, power, cars, the, coaches, are, air, sealed, to, ensure, stable, air, pressure, when, entering, tunnels, at, high, speed, shinkansen, trains, excluding, mini, shinkansen, are, also, built, to, a, larger, loading, gauge, compared, to, conventional, speed, rolling, stock, this, larger, loading, gauge, permits, wider, coaches, allowing, for, 5, abreast, seating, 2, 3, in, standard, class, coaches, compared, to, the, more, common, 4, abreast, 2, 2, seating, usually, found, elsewhere, on, occasions, this, wider, loading, gauge, was, also, used, to, allow, 6, abreast, seating, 3, 3, on, certain, trains, such, as, the, e1, and, e4, series, sets, this, combined, with, a, lack, of, power, cars, allows, for, a, higher, passenger, capacity, within, a, shorter, train, length, however, since, mini, shinkansen, lines, are, effectively, track, regauged, conventional, lines, the, conventional, loading, gauge, for, 1, 067mm, lines, still, applies, on, mini, shinkansen, lines, the, shinkansen, has, used, emus, from, the, outset, with, the, 0, series, shinkansen, having, all, axles, powered, other, railway, manufacturers, were, traditionally, reluctant, or, unable, to, use, distributed, traction, configurations, talgo, the, german, ice, 2, and, the, french, and, subsequently, south, korean, tgv, and, ktx, i, and, ktx, sancheon, use, the, locomotive, also, known, as, power, car, configuration, with, the, renfe, class, 102, and, continues, with, it, for, the, talgo, avril, because, it, is, not, possible, to, use, powered, bogies, as, part, of, talgo, s, bogie, design, which, uses, a, modified, jacobs, bogie, with, a, single, axle, instead, of, two, and, allows, the, wheels, to, rotate, independently, of, each, other, on, the, ice, 2, tgv, and, ktx, it, is, because, it, easily, allows, for, a, high, ride, quality, and, less, electrical, equipment, in, japan, significant, engineering, desirability, exists, for, the, electric, multiple, unit, configuration, a, greater, proportion, of, motored, axles, permits, higher, acceleration, so, the, shinkansen, does, not, lose, as, much, time, if, stopping, frequently, shinkansen, lines, have, more, stops, in, proportion, to, their, lengths, than, high, speed, lines, elsewhere, in, the, world, the, main, shinkansen, lines, are, in, practice, the, tokaido, san, y, and, kyushu, lines, form, a, contiguous, west, southbound, line, from, tokyo, as, train, services, run, between, the, tokaido, and, san, y, lines, and, between, the, san, y, and, kyushu, lines, though, the, lines, are, operated, by, different, companies, the, tokaido, shinkansen, tracks, are, not, physically, connected, to, the, lines, of, the, tohoku, shinkansen, at, tokyo, station, as, they, use, different, electrification, standards, signaling, systems, and, earthquake, mitigation, devices, there, also, exists, a, dispute, between, jr, east, and, jr, central, about, the, use, of, the, two, platforms, which, were, added, to, the, tokaido, line, s, half, of, tokyo, station, before, jnr, s, privatization, they, were, conceived, as, being, shared, with, the, tohoku, line, and, their, construction, used, funds, allocated, to, the, tohoku, line, s, extension, to, tokyo, however, the, extension, was, finished, after, privatization, by, which, time, the, platforms, were, owned, by, jr, central, therefore, there, is, no, through, service, between, those, lines, all, northbound, services, from, tokyo, travel, along, the, tohoku, shinkansen, until, at, least, miya, before, splitting, off, towards, sendai, or, takasaki, two, further, lines, known, as, mini, shinkansen, have, also, been, constructed, by, re, gauging, and, upgrading, existing, sections, of, line, there, are, two, standard, gauge, lines, not, technically, classified, as, shinkansen, lines, but, run, shinkansen, trains, as, they, use, tracks, leading, to, shinkansen, storage, maintenance, yards, the, following, lines, are, under, construction, these, lines, except, ch, shinkansen, called, seibi, shinkansen, or, planned, shinkansen, are, the, shinkansen, projects, designated, in, the, basic, plan, of, the, shinkansen, railway, decided, by, the, government, the, narita, shinkansen, project, to, connect, tokyo, to, narita, international, airport, initiated, in, the, 1970s, but, halted, in, 1983, after, landowner, protests, has, been, officially, cancelled, and, removed, from, the, basic, plan, governing, shinkansen, construction, parts, of, its, planned, right, of, way, were, used, by, the, narita, sky, access, line, which, opened, in, 2010, and, the, keiyo, line, reused, space, originally, set, aside, for, the, narita, shinkansen, terminus, at, tokyo, station, although, the, sky, access, line, uses, standard, gauge, track, it, was, not, built, to, shinkansen, specifications, and, there, are, no, plans, to, convert, it, into, a, full, shinkansen, line, many, shinkansen, lines, were, proposed, during, the, boom, of, the, early, 1970s, but, have, yet, to, be, constructed, and, have, subsequently, been, shelved, indefinitely, in, addition, the, basic, plan, specified, that, the, j, etsu, shinkansen, should, start, from, shinjuku, not, tokyo, station, which, would, have, required, building, an, additional, 30, km, 19, mi, of, track, between, shinjuku, and, miya, while, no, construction, work, was, ever, started, land, along, the, proposed, track, including, an, underground, section, leading, to, shinjuku, station, remains, reserved, if, capacity, on, the, current, tokyo, miya, section, proves, insufficient, at, some, point, construction, of, the, shinjuku, miya, link, may, be, reconsidered, in, december, 2009, then, transport, minister, seiji, maehara, proposed, a, bullet, train, link, to, haneda, airport, using, an, existing, spur, that, connects, the, t, kaid, shinkansen, to, a, train, depot, jr, central, called, the, plan, unrealistic, due, to, tight, train, schedules, on, the, existing, line, but, reports, said, that, maehara, wished, to, continue, discussions, on, the, idea, the, current, minister, has, not, indicated, whether, this, proposal, remains, supported, while, the, plan, may, become, more, feasible, after, the, opening, the, ch, shinkansen, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, bypass, to, the, tokaido, shinkansen, frees, up, capacity, construction, is, already, underway, for, other, rail, improvements, between, haneda, and, tokyo, station, expected, to, be, completed, prior, to, the, opening, of, the, 2020, tokyo, olympics, so, any, potential, shinkansen, service, would, likely, offer, only, marginal, benefit, beyond, that, despite, these, plans, ultimately, not, being, realized, owing, in, part, due, to, the, effects, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, various, rail, projects, in, the, vicinity, of, haneda, airport, including, the, haneda, airport, access, line, and, the, tokyo, rinkai, subway, line, continue, to, undergo, planning, originally, intended, to, carry, passenger, trains, by, day, and, freight, trains, by, night, the, shinkansen, lines, carried, exclusively, passengers, for, the, first, five, and, a, half, decades, of, their, operation, since, 2019, light, freight, has, been, carried, on, some, passenger, services, and, there, are, plans, to, expand, this, with, freight, only, trains, in, the, future, the, system, shuts, down, between, midnight, and, 06, 00, every, day, for, maintenance, the, few, overnight, passenger, trains, that, still, run, in, japan, run, on, the, older, narrow, gauge, network, that, the, shinkansen, parallels, there, are, three, principal, service, types, on, the, shinkansen, trains, are, up, to, sixteen, cars, long, with, each, car, measuring, 25, m, 82, ft, in, length, the, longest, trains, are, 400, m, 1, 4, mile, end, to, end, stations, are, similarly, long, to, accommodate, these, trains, some, of, japan, s, high, speed, maglev, trains, are, considered, shinkansen, while, other, slower, maglev, trains, such, as, the, linimo, maglev, train, line, serving, local, community, near, the, city, of, nagoya, in, aichi, japan, are, intended, as, alternatives, to, conventional, urban, rapid, transit, systems, note, that, these, trains, were, and, currently, are, used, only, for, experimental, runs, though, the, l0, series, could, be, a, passenger, train, the, shinkansen, is, very, reliable, thanks, to, several, factors, including, its, near, total, separation, from, slower, traffic, in, 2016, jr, central, reported, that, the, shinkansen, s, average, delay, from, schedule, per, train, was, 24, seconds, this, includes, delays, due, to, uncontrollable, causes, such, as, natural, disasters, in, april, 2024, a, train, arriving, to, nagoya, was, delayed, by, 17, minutes, due, to, a, report, of, small, snakes, slithering, through, a, passenger, carriage, over, the, shinkansen, s, 50, plus, year, history, carrying, over, 10,

lines, particularly, in, the, very, crowded, coastal, taiheiy, belt, megalopolis, met, two, primary, goals, however, upon, the, introduction, of, the, 1973, basic, plan, the, initial, prudence, in, developing, shinkansen, lines, gave, way, to, political, considerations, to, extend, the, mode, to, far, less, populated, regions, of, the, country, partly, to, spread, these, benefits, beyond, the, key, centres, of, kanto, and, kinki, although, in, some, cases, regional, extension, was, frustrated, by, protracted, land, acquisition, issues, sometimes, influenced, by, the, cancellation, of, the, narita, shinkansen, following, fierce, protests, by, locals, over, time, shinkansen, lines, were, built, to, relatively, sparsely, populated, areas, with, the, intent, the, network, would, disperse,

regional, railways, additionally, it, assumed, shinkansen, construction, debt, to, the, point, the, government, corporation, eventually, owed, some, 28, trillion, contributing, to, it, being, regionalised, and, privatized, in, 1987, the, privatized, jrs, eventually, paid, a, total, of, 9, 2, trillion, to, acquire, jnr, s, shinkansen, network, following, privatization, the, jr, group, of, companies, have, continued, shinkansen, network, expansion, to, less, populated, areas, but, with, far, more, flexibility, to, spin, off, unprofitable, railways, or, cut, costs, than, in, jnr, days, currently, an, important, factor, is, the, post, bubble, zero, interest, rate, policy, that, allows, jr, to, borrow, huge, sums, of, capital, without, significant, concern, regarding, repayment, timing, a, ucla, study, found, that, the, presence, of, a, shinkansen, line, had, helped, with, housing, affordability, by, making, it, more, realistic, for, lower, income, city, workers, to, live, in, exurban, areas, much, further, away, from, the, city, which, tends, to, have, cheaper, housing, options, that, in, turn, helps, the, city, to, decentralise, and, thus, reduce, the, city, property,

been, served, by, the, end, of, 2018, and, is, projected, to, pass, japan, s, cumulative, numbers, by, as, early, as, 2020, e5, series, trains, capable, of, up, to, 320, km, h, 200, mph, initially, limited, to, 300, km, h, 186, mph, were, introduced, on, the, t, hoku, shinkansen, in, march, 2011, operation, at, the, maximum, speed, of, 320, km, h, 200, mph, between, utsunomiya, and, morioka, on, this, route, commenced, on, 16, march, 2013, it, reduced, the, journey, time, to, around, 3, hours, for, trains, from, tokyo, to, shin, aomori, a, distance, of, 674, km, 419, mi, extensive, trials, using, the, fastech, 360, test, trains, have, shown, that, operation, at, 360, km, h, 224, mph, is, not, currently, feasible, because, of, problems, of, noise, pollution, particularly, tunnel, boom, overhead, wire, wear, and, braking, distances, on, 30, october, 2012, jr, east, announced, that, it, was, pursuing, research, and, development, to, increase, speeds, to, 360, km, h, 224, mph, on, the, tohoku, shinkansen, by, 2020, the, alfa, x, is, currently, undergoing, testing, upon, commencement, of, services, in, 2016, the, maximum, speed, on, the, approximately, 82, km, 51, mi, dual, gauge, section, of, the, hokkaido, shinkansen, including, through, the, seikan, tunnel, was, 140, km, h, 85, mph, which, was, increased, to, 160, km, h, 100, mph, by, march, 2019, there, are, approximately, 50, freight, trains, using, the, dual, gauge, section, each, day, so, limiting, the, travel, of, such, trains, to, times, outside, of, shinkansen, services, is, not, an, option, because, of, this, and, other, weather, related, factors, cited, by, jr, east, and, jr, hokkaido, the, fastest, journey, time, between, tokyo, and, shin, hakodate, hokuto, is, currently, 3, hours, 57, minutes, during, the, 2020, 21, new, year, holiday, period, certain, shinkansen, services, were, operated, at, 210, km, h, 130, mph, on, the, dual, gauge, section, and, was, proposed, again, for, the, golden, week, holiday, period, from, 3, 6, may, 2021, due, to, fewer, freight, trains, operating, to, achieve, the, full, benefit, of, shinkansen, trains, travelling, on, the, dual, gauge, section, at, 260, km, h, 160, mph, the, maximum, speed, proposed, through, the, tunnel, alternatives, are, being, considered, such, as, a, system, to, automatically, slow, shinkansen, trains, to, 200, km, h, 125, mph, when, passing, narrow, gauge, trains, and, or, loading, freight, trains, onto, special, train, on, train, standard, gauge, trains, akin, to, a, covered, piggyback, flatcar, train, built, to, withstand, the, shock, wave, of, oncoming, shinkansen, trains, traveling, at, full, speed, this, would, enable, a, travel, time, from, tokyo, to, shin, hakodate, hokuto, of, 3, hours, and, 45, minutes, a, saving, of, 12, minutes, on, the, current, timetable, the, hokuriku, shinkansen, was, extended, from, kanazawa, to, tsuruga, on, 16, march, 2024, there, are, further, plans, to, extend, the, line, from, tsuruga, to, osaka, with, the, obama, kyoto, route, chosen, by, the, government, on, 20, december, 2016, after, a, government, committee, investigated, the, five, nominated, routes, construction, of, the, extension, beyond, tsuruga, is, not, expected, to, commence, before, 2030, with, a, projected, 15, year, construction, period, on, 6, march, 2017, the, government, committee, announced, the, chosen, route, from, kyoto, to, shin, osaka, is, to, be, via, kyotanabe, with, a, station, at, matsuiyamate, on, the, katamachi, line, to, extend, the, benefits, of, the, hokuriku, shinkansen, to, stations, west, of, tsuruga, before, the, line, to, osaka, is, completed, jr, west, was, working, in, partnership, with, talgo, on, the, development, of, a, gauge, change, train, cgt, capable, of, operating, under, both, the, 25, kv, ac, electrification, used, on, the, shinkansen, and, the, 1, 5, kv, dc, system, employed, on, conventional, lines, a, trial, of, the, proposed, bogie, was, undertaken, on, a, purpose, built, 180, m, 590, ft, gauge, changer, at, tsuruga, but, it, was, unsuccessful, and, the, plans, were, abandoned, the, hokkaido, shinkansen, forms, an, extension, of, the, tohoku, shinkansen, north, of, shin, aomori, to, shin, hakodate, hokuto, station, north, of, the, hokkaido, city, of, hakodate, through, the, seikan, tunnel, which, was, converted, to, dual, gauge, as, part, of, the, project, opening, in, march, 2016, jr, hokkaido, is, extending, the, hokkaido, shinkansen, from, shin, hakodate, hokuto, to, sapporo, to, open, by, march, 2031, with, tunnelling, work, on, the, 5, 27, km, 3, 27, mi, murayama, tunnel, situated, about, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, north, of, shin, hakodate, hokuto, station, commencing, in, march, 2015, and, due, to, be, completed, by, march, 2021, the, 211, 3, km, 131, 3, mi, extension, will, be, approximately, 76, in, tunnels, including, major, tunnels, such, as, oshima, 26, 5, km, 16, 5, mi, teine, 26, 5, km, 16, 5, mi, and, shiribeshi, 18, km, 11, mi, although, an, extension, from, sapporo, to, asahikawa, was, included, in, the, 1973, list, of, planned, lines, at, this, time, it, is, unknown, whether, the, hokkaido, shinkansen, will, be, extended, beyond, sapporo, jr, kyushu, opened, the, nishi, kyushu, shinkansen, from, takeo, onsen, to, nagasaki, built, to, full, shinkansen, standard, on, 23, september, 2022, with, the, existing, narrow, gauge, section, between, shin, tosu, and, takeo, onsen, proposed, to, be, upgraded, as, part, of, this, project, this, proposal, initially, involved, introducing, gauge, change, trains, gct, travelling, from, hakata, to, shin, tosu, 26, 3, km, 16, 3, mi, on, the, existing, kyushu, shinkansen, line, then, passing, through, a, specific, gauge, changing, standard, to, narrow, section, of, track, linking, to, the, existing, nagasaki, main, line, along, which, it, would, travel, to, hizen, yamaguchi, 37, 6, km, 23, 4, mi, then, onto, the, sasebo, line, to, takeo, onsen, 13, 7, km, 8, 5, mi, where, another, gauge, changing, section, narrow, to, standard, would, lead, onto, the, final, shinkansen, line, to, nagasaki, 66, km, 41, mi, however, significant, technical, issues, with, the, axles, of, the, gct, resulted, in, its, cancellation, on, 28, october, 2020, jr, kyushu, announced, it, would, utilize, a, 6, car, version, of, the, n700s, for, the, isolated, shinkansen, section, from, nagasaki, with, cross, platform, change, to, a, relay, service, at, takeo, onsen, station, to, connect, to, hakata, jr, kyushu, also, announced, the, service, would, continue, to, use, the, name, kamome, for, the, hakata, nagasaki, service, which, has, been, in, use, since, 1961, the, shinkansen, line, shortens, the, distance, between, hakata, and, nagasaki, by, 6, 2, 9, 6, km, 6, 0, mi, and, while, only, 64, of, the, route, is, built, to, full, shinkansen, standards, it, eliminated, the, slowest, sections, of, the, previous, narrow, gauge, route, as, part, of, the, gct, proposal, the, current, 12, 8, km, 8, 0, mi, section, of, single, track, between, hizen, yamaguchi, and, takeo, onsen, was, proposed, to, be, duplicated, however, due, to, the, issues, with, the, development, of, the, gct, the, proposal, has, not, advanced, the, initial, section, between, nagasaki, and, takeo, onsen, opened, on, 23, september, 2022, maglev, trains, have, been, undertaking, test, runs, on, the, yamanashi, test, track, since, 1997, running, at, speeds, of, over, 500, km, h, 310, mph, as, a, result, of, this, extensive, testing, maglev, technology, is, almost, ready, for, public, usage, an, extension, of, this, test, track, from, 18, 4, to, 42, 8, km, 11, 4, to, 26, 6, mi, was, completed, in, june, 2013, enabling, extended, high, speed, running, trials, to, commence, in, august, 2013, this, section, will, be, incorporated, into, the, ch, shinkansen, which, will, eventually, link, tokyo, to, osaka, construction, of, the, shinagawa, to, nagoya, section, began, in, 2014, with, 86, of, the, 286, km, 178, mi, route, to, be, in, tunnels, plans, were, approved, in, 2017, for, the, ch, shinkansen, to, begin, at, tokyo, station, rather, than, shinagawa, station, as, initially, planned, due, to, difficulties, in, securing, land, the, ceo, of, jr, central, originally, announced, plans, to, have, the, maglev, ch, shinkansen, operating, from, tokyo, to, nagoya, by, 2027, with, a, subsequent, extension, to, osaka, by, 2037, however, as, of, 2022, continuing, controversy, over, routing, across, the, i, river, has, prevented, the, start, of, construction, in, shizuoka, and, there, is, currently, no, target, date, for, opening, following, the, shortest, route, through, the, japanese, alps, jr, central, estimates, that, it, will, take, 40, minutes, to, run, from, shinagawa, to, nagoya, the, planned, travel, time, from, shinagawa, to, shin, osaka, is, 1, hour, 7, minutes, currently, the, tokaido, shinkansen, has, a, minimum, connection, time, of, 2, hours, 19, minutes, while, the, government, has, granted, approval, for, the, shortest, route, between, tokyo, and, nagoya, some, prefectural, governments, particularly, nagano, lobbied, to, have, the, line, routed, farther, north, to, serve, the, city, of, chino, and, either, ina, or, kiso, fukushima, however, that, would, increase, both, the, travel, time, from, tokyo, to, nagoya, and, the, cost, of, construction, jr, central, has, confirmed, it, will, construct, the, line, through, kanagawa, prefecture, and, terminate, at, tokyo, station, the, route, for, the, nagoya, to, osaka, section, is, also, contested, it, is, planned, to, go, via, nara, about, 40, km, 25, mi, south, of, kyoto, kyoto, is, lobbying, to, have, the, route, moved, north, and, be, largely, aligned, with, the, existing, tokaido, shinkansen, which, services, kyoto, and, not, nara, mini, shinkansen, is, the, name, given, to, the, routes, where, former, narrow, gauge, lines, have, been, converted, to, standard, gauge, to, allow, shinkansen, trains, to, travel, to, cities, without, the, expense, of, constructing, full, shinkansen, standard, lines, two, mini, shinkansen, routes, have, been, constructed, the, yamagata, shinkansen, and, akita, shinkansen, shinkansen, services, to, these, lines, traverse, the, tohoku, shinkansen, line, from, tokyo, before, branching, off, to, traditional, main, lines, on, both, the, yamagata, shinjo, and, akita, lines, the, narrow, gauge, lines, were, regauged, resulting, in, the, local, services, being, operated, by, standard, gauge, versions, of, 1, 067, mm, 3, ft, 6, in, suburban, interurban, rolling, stock, on, the, akita, line, between, omagari, and, akita, one, of, the, two, narrow, gauge, lines, was, regauged, and, a, section, of, the, remaining, narrow, gauge, line, is, dual, gauge, providing, the, opportunity, for, shinkansen, services, to, pass, each, other, without, stopping, the, maximum, speed, on, these, lines, is, 130, km, h, 81, mph, however, the, overall, travel, time, to, from, tokyo, is, improved, due, to, the, elimination, of, the, need, for, passengers, to, change, trains, at, fukushima, and, morioka, respectively, as, the, loading, gauge, size, of, the, train, that, can, travel, on, a, line, was, not, altered, when, the, rail, gauge, was, widened, only, shinkansen, trains, specially, built, for, these, routes, can, travel, on, the, lines, at, present, they, are, the, e3, and, e6, series, trains, as, some, of, the, e3, series, on, the, yamagata, shinkansen, will, be, retiring, soon, they, will, be, replaced, by, the, new, e8, series, shinkansen, trains, from, spring, 2024, with, an, increased, speed, of, 300, km, h, 186, mph, up, from, the, current, 275, km, h, 171, mph, on, the, e3, series, trains, whilst, no, further, mini, shinkansen, routes, have, been, proposed, to, date, it, remains, an, option, for, providing, shinkansen, services, to, cities, on, the, narrow, gauge, network, construction, of, a, base, tunnel, on, the, yamagata, shinkansen, is, proposed, with, jr, east, having, undertaken, a, survey, of, a, planned, route, from, niwasaka, to, sekine, just, south, of, yonezawa, station, 23, 1, km, 14, 4, mi, of, the, proposed, 24, 9, km, 15, 5, mi, line, would, be, in, tunnel, mostly, to, the, north, of, the, existing, 88, km, 55, mi, fukushima, yamagata, section, to, be, built, on, an, improved, alignment, the, tunnel, would, lower, journey, times, between, fukushima, and, yamagata, by, 10, min, due, to, a, proposed, line, speed, of, up, to, 200, km, h, the, tunnel, would, avoid, the, itaya, toge, pass, through, the, ou, mountains, west, of, fukushima, gradients, range, from, 3, 0, to, 3, 8, and, the, line, reaches, an, altitude, of, 548, m, 1, 798, ft, the, curvature, and, steep, grades, limit, train, speeds, to, 55, km, h, 34, mph, or, less, and, the, line, is, vulnerable, to, heavy, rain, and, snowfall, as, well, as, high, winds, between, 2011, and, 2017, a, total, of, 410, yamagata, mini, shinkansen, services, were, either, suspended, or, delayed, and, 40, of, these, incidents, occurred, on, the, line, over, the, itaya, toge, pass, if, the, 150, billion, base, tunnel, is, authorised, detailed, design, would, take, five, years, and, construction, another, 15, years, the, cost, could, increase, by, 12, billion, if, the, tunnel, were, to, be, built, with, a, cross, section, large, enough, to, permit, the, line, to, be, upgraded, to, the, full, shinkansen, loading, gauge, this, is, the, name, for, the, concept, of, using, a, single, train, that, is, specially, designed, to, travel, on, both, 1, 067, mm, 3, ft, 6, in, narrow, gauge, railway, lines, and, the, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, standard, gauge, used, by, shinkansen, train, services, in, japan, the, trucks, bogies, of, the, gauge, change, train, gct, allow, the, wheels, to, be, unlocked, from, the, axles, narrowed, or, widened, as, necessary, and, then, relocked, this, allows, a, gct, to, traverse, both, standard, gauge, and, narrow, gauge, tracks, without, the, expense, of, regauging, lines, three, test, trains, have, been, constructed, with, the, second, set, having, completed, reliability, trials, on, the, yosan, line, east, of, matsuyama, in, shikoku, in, september, 2013, the, third, set, was, undertaking, gauge, changing, trials, at, shin, yatsushiro, station, on, kyushu, commencing, in, 2014, for, a, proposed, three, year, period, however, testing, was, suspended, in, december, 2014, after, accumulating, approximating, 33, 000,
