in, agriculture, a, harrow, is, a, farm, implement, used, for, surface, tillage, it, is, used, after, ploughing, for, breaking, up, and, smoothing, out, the, surface, of, the, soil, the, purpose, of, harrowing, is, to, break, up, clods, and, to, provide, a, soil, structure, called, tilth, that, is, suitable, for, planting, seeds, coarser, harrowing, may, also, be, used, to, remove, weeds, and, to, cover, seed, after, sowing, harrows, differ, from, ploughs, which, cut, the, upper, 12, to, 25, centimetre, 5, to, 10, in, layer, of, soil, and, leave, furrows, parallel, trenches, harrows, differ, from, cultivators, in, that, they, disturb, the, whole, surface, of, the, soil, while, a, cultivator, instead, disturbs, only, narrow, tracks, between, the, crop, rows, to, kill, weeds, there, are, four, general, types, of, harrows, disc, harrows, tine, harrows, including, spring, tooth, harrows, drag, harrows, and, spike, harrows, chain, harrows, and, chain, disk, harrows, harrows, were, originally, drawn, by, draft, animals, such, as, horses, mules, or, oxen, or, in, some, times, and, places, by, manual, labourers, in, modern, practice, they, are, almost, always, tractor, mounted, implements, either, trailed, after, the, tractor, by, a, drawbar, or, mounted, on, the, three, point, hitch, a, modern, development, of, the, traditional, harrow, is, the, rotary, power, harrow, often, just, called, a, power, harrow, in, modern, mechanized, farming, generally, a, farmer, will, use, two, harrows, one, after, the, other, the, disk, harrow, is, used, first, to, slice, up, the, large, clods, left, by, the, mould, board, plough, followed, by, the, spring, tooth, harrow, to, save, time, and, fuel, they, may, be, pulled, by, one, tractor, the, disk, hitched, to, the, tractor, and, the, spring, tooth, hitched, to, and, directly, behind, the, disk, the, result, is, a, smooth, field, with, powdery, dirt, at, the, surface, in, cooler, climates, the, most, common, types, are, the, disc, harrow, the, chain, harrow, the, tine, harrow, or, spike, harrow, and, the, spring, tine, harrow, chain, harrows, are, often, used, for, lighter, work, such, as, levelling, the, tilth, or, covering, seed, while, disc, harrows, are, typically, used, for, heavy, work, such, as, following, ploughing, to, break, up, the, sod, in, addition, there, are, various, types, of, power, harrow, in, which, the, cultivators, are, power, driven, from, the, tractor, rather, than, depending, on, its, forward, motion, tine, harrows, are, used, to, refine, seed, bed, condition, before, planting, to, remove, small, weeds, in, growing, crops, and, to, loosen, the, inter, row, soils, to, allow, for, water, to, soak, into, the, subsoil, the, fourth, is, a, chain, disk, harrow, disk, attached, to, chains, are, pulled, at, an, angle, over, the, ground, these, harrows, move, rapidly, across, the, surface, the, chain, and, disk, rotate, to, stay, clean, while, breaking, up, the, top, surface, to, about, 1, inch, 3, cm, deep, a, smooth, seedbed, is, prepared, for, planting, with, one, pass, chain, harrowing, can, be, used, on, pasture, land, to, spread, out, dung, and, to, break, up, dead, material, thatch, in, the, sward, and, similarly, in, sports, ground, maintenance, a, light, chain, harrowing, is, often, used, to, level, off, the, ground, after, heavy, use, to, remove, and, smooth, out, boot, marks, and, indentations, used, on, tilled, land, in, combination, with, the, other, two, types, chain, harrowing, rolls, remaining, larger, soil, clumps, to, the, surface, where, weather, breaks, them, down, and, prevents, interference, with, seed, germination, all, four, harrow, types, can, be, used, in, one, pass, to, prepare, soil, for, seeding, it, is, also, common, to, use, any, combination, of, two, harrows, for, a, variety, of, tilling, processes, where, harrowing, provides, a, very, fine, tilth, or, the, soil, is, very, light, so, that, it, might, easily, be, wind, blown, a, roller, is, often, added, as, the, last, of, the, set, harrows, may, be, of, several, types, and, weights, depending, on, their, purpose, they, almost, always, consist, of, a, rigid, frame, that, holds, discs, teeth, linked, chains, or, other, means, of, moving, soil, but, tine, and, chain, harrows, are, often, only, supported, by, a, rigid, towing, bar, at, the, front, of, the, set, in, the, southern, hemisphere, so, called, giant, discs, are, a, specialised, kind, of, disc, harrows, that, can, stand, in, for, a, plough, in, rough, country, where, a, mouldboard, plough, cannot, handle, tree, stumps, and, rocks, and, a, disc, plough, is, too, slow, because, of, its, limited, number, of, discs, giant, scalloped, edged, discs, operate, in, a, set, or, frame, that, is, often, weighted, with, concrete, or, steel, blocks, to, improve, penetration, of, the, cutting, edges, this, sort, of, cultivation, is, usually, followed, by, broadcast, fertilisation, and, seeding, rather, than, drilled, or, row, seeding, a, drag, is, a, heavy, harrow, a, rotary, power, harrow, or, simply, power, harrow, has, multiple, sets, of, vertical, tines, each, set, of, tines, is, rotated, on, a, vertical, axis, and, tills, the, soil, horizontally, the, result, is, that, unlike, a, rotary, tiller, soil, layers, are, not, turned, over, or, inverted, which, is, useful, in, preventing, dormant, weed, seeds, from, being, brought, to, the, surface, and, there, is, no, horizontal, slicing, of, the, subsurface, soil, that, can, lead, to, hardpan, formation, in, europe, harrows, were, used, in, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, the, oldest, known, illustration, of, a, harrow, is, in, scene, 10, of, the, eleventh, century, bayeux, tapestry, an, arabic, reference, to, harrows, is, to, be, found, in, abu, bakr, ibn, wahshiyya, s, nabatean, agriculture, kitab, al, filaha, al, nabatiyya, of, the, 10th, century, but, claiming, knowledge, from, babylonian, sources
