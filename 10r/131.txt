an, integrated, circuit, ic, also, known, as, a, microchip, computer, chip, or, simply, chip, is, a, small, electronic, device, made, up, of, multiple, interconnected, electronic, components, such, as, transistors, resistors, and, capacitors, these, components, are, etched, onto, a, small, piece, of, semiconductor, material, usually, silicon, integrated, circuits, are, used, in, a, wide, range, of, electronic, devices, including, computers, smartphones, and, televisions, to, perform, various, functions, such, as, processing, and, storing, information, they, have, greatly, impacted, the, field, of, electronics, by, enabling, device, miniaturization, and, enhanced, functionality, integrated, circuits, are, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, faster, and, less, expensive, than, those, constructed, of, discrete, components, allowing, a, large, transistor, count, the, ic, s, mass, production, capability, reliability, and, building, block, approach, to, integrated, circuit, design, have, ensured, the, rapid, adoption, of, standardized, ics, in, place, of, designs, using, discrete, transistors, ics, are, now, used, in, virtually, all, electronic, equipment, and, have, revolutionized, the, world, of, electronics, computers, mobile, phones, and, other, home, appliances, are, now, essential, parts, of, the, structure, of, modern, societies, made, possible, by, the, small, size, and, low, cost, of, ics, such, as, modern, computer, processors, and, microcontrollers, very, large, scale, integration, was, made, practical, by, technological, advancements, in, semiconductor, device, fabrication, since, their, origins, in, the, 1960s, the, size, speed, and, capacity, of, chips, have, progressed, enormously, driven, by, technical, advances, that, fit, more, and, more, transistors, on, chips, of, the, same, size, a, modern, chip, may, have, many, billions, of, transistors, in, an, area, the, size, of, a, human, fingernail, these, advances, roughly, following, moore, s, law, make, the, computer, chips, of, today, possess, millions, of, times, the, capacity, and, thousands, of, times, the, speed, of, the, computer, chips, of, the, early, 1970s, ics, have, three, main, advantages, over, circuits, constructed, out, of, discrete, components, size, cost, and, performance, the, size, and, cost, is, low, because, the, chips, with, all, their, components, are, printed, as, a, unit, by, photolithography, rather, than, being, constructed, one, transistor, at, a, time, furthermore, packaged, ics, use, much, less, material, than, discrete, circuits, performance, is, high, because, the, ic, s, components, switch, quickly, and, consume, comparatively, little, power, because, of, their, small, size, and, proximity, the, main, disadvantage, of, ics, is, the, high, initial, cost, of, designing, them, and, the, enormous, capital, cost, of, factory, construction, this, high, initial, cost, means, ics, are, only, commercially, viable, when, high, production, volumes, are, anticipated, an, integrated, circuit, is, defined, as, a, circuit, in, which, all, or, some, of, the, circuit, elements, are, inseparably, associated, and, electrically, interconnected, so, that, it, is, considered, to, be, indivisible, for, the, purposes, of, construction, and, commerce, in, strict, usage, integrated, circuit, refers, to, the, single, piece, circuit, construction, originally, known, as, a, monolithic, integrated, circuit, which, comprises, a, single, piece, of, silicon, in, general, usage, circuits, not, meeting, this, strict, definition, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, ics, which, are, constructed, using, many, different, technologies, e, g, 3d, ic, 2, 5d, ic, mcm, thin, film, transistors, thick, film, technologies, or, hybrid, integrated, circuits, the, choice, of, terminology, frequently, appears, in, discussions, related, to, whether, moore, s, law, is, obsolete, an, early, attempt, at, combining, several, components, in, one, device, like, modern, ics, was, the, loewe, 3nf, vacuum, tube, first, made, in, 1926, unlike, ics, it, was, designed, with, the, purpose, of, tax, avoidance, as, in, germany, radio, receivers, had, a, tax, that, was, levied, depending, on, how, many, tube, holders, a, radio, receiver, had, it, allowed, radio, receivers, to, have, a, single, tube, holder, one, million, were, manufactured, and, were, a, first, step, in, integration, of, radioelectronic, devices, the, device, contained, an, amplifier, composed, of, three, triodes, two, capacitors, and, four, resistors, in, a, six, pin, device, radios, with, the, loewe, 3nf, were, less, expensive, than, other, radios, showing, one, of, the, advantages, of, integration, over, using, discrete, components, that, would, be, seen, decades, later, with, ics, early, concepts, of, an, integrated, circuit, go, back, to, 1949, when, german, engineer, werner, jacobi, siemens, ag, filed, a, patent, for, an, integrated, circuit, like, semiconductor, amplifying, device, showing, five, transistors, on, a, common, substrate, in, a, three, stage, amplifier, arrangement, jacobi, disclosed, small, and, cheap, hearing, aids, as, typical, industrial, applications, of, his, patent, an, immediate, commercial, use, of, his, patent, has, not, been, reported, another, early, proponent, of, the, concept, was, geoffrey, dummer, 1909, 2002, a, radar, scientist, working, for, the, royal, radar, establishment, of, the, british, ministry, of, defence, dummer, presented, the, idea, to, the, public, at, the, symposium, on, progress, in, quality, electronic, components, in, washington, d, c, on, 7, may, 1952, he, gave, many, symposia, publicly, to, propagate, his, ideas, and, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, build, such, a, circuit, in, 1956, between, 1953, and, 1957, sidney, darlington, and, yasuo, tarui, electrotechnical, laboratory, proposed, similar, chip, designs, where, several, transistors, could, share, a, common, active, area, but, there, was, no, electrical, isolation, to, separate, them, from, each, other, the, monolithic, integrated, circuit, chip, was, enabled, by, the, inventions, of, the, planar, process, by, jean, hoerni, and, p, n, junction, isolation, by, kurt, lehovec, hoerni, s, invention, was, built, on, carl, frosch, and, lincoln, derick, s, work, on, surface, protection, and, passivation, by, silicon, dioxide, masking, and, predeposition, as, well, as, fuller, ditzenberger, s, and, others, work, on, the, diffusion, of, impurities, into, silicon, a, precursor, idea, to, the, ic, was, to, create, small, ceramic, substrates, so, called, micromodules, each, containing, a, single, miniaturized, component, components, could, then, be, integrated, and, wired, into, a, bidimensional, or, tridimensional, compact, grid, this, idea, which, seemed, very, promising, in, 1957, was, proposed, to, the, us, army, by, jack, kilby, and, led, to, the, short, lived, micromodule, program, similar, to, 1951, s, project, tinkertoy, however, as, the, project, was, gaining, momentum, kilby, came, up, with, a, new, revolutionary, design, the, ic, newly, employed, by, texas, instruments, kilby, recorded, his, initial, ideas, concerning, the, integrated, circuit, in, july, 1958, successfully, demonstrating, the, first, working, example, of, an, integrated, circuit, on, 12, september, 1958, in, his, patent, application, of, 6, february, 1959, kilby, described, his, new, device, as, a, body, of, semiconductor, material, wherein, all, the, components, of, the, electronic, circuit, are, completely, integrated, the, first, customer, for, the, new, invention, was, the, us, air, force, kilby, won, the, 2000, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, part, in, the, invention, of, the, integrated, circuit, however, kilby, s, invention, was, not, a, true, monolithic, integrated, circuit, chip, since, it, had, external, gold, wire, connections, which, would, have, made, it, difficult, to, mass, produce, half, a, year, after, kilby, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, invented, the, first, true, monolithic, ic, chip, more, practical, than, kilby, s, implementation, noyce, s, chip, was, made, of, silicon, whereas, kilby, s, was, made, of, germanium, and, noyce, s, was, fabricated, using, the, planar, process, developed, in, early, 1959, by, his, colleague, jean, hoerni, and, included, the, critical, on, chip, aluminum, interconnecting, lines, modern, ic, chips, are, based, on, noyce, s, monolithic, ic, rather, than, kilby, s, nasa, s, apollo, program, was, the, largest, single, consumer, of, integrated, circuits, between, 1961, and, 1965, transistor, transistor, logic, ttl, was, developed, by, james, l, buie, in, the, early, 1960s, at, trw, inc, ttl, became, the, dominant, integrated, circuit, technology, during, the, 1970s, to, early, 1980s, dozens, of, ttl, integrated, circuits, were, a, standard, method, of, construction, for, the, processors, of, minicomputers, and, mainframe, computers, computers, such, as, ibm, 360, mainframes, pdp, 11, minicomputers, and, the, desktop, datapoint, 2200, were, built, from, bipolar, integrated, circuits, either, ttl, or, the, even, faster, emitter, coupled, logic, ecl, an, eprom, is, a, type, of, chip, whose, concept, was, developed, by, israeli, electrical, engineer, dov, frohman, in, 1969, and, developed, in, practice, in, 1971, while, frohman, worked, for, intel, nearly, all, modern, ic, chips, are, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, integrated, circuits, built, from, mosfets, metal, oxide, silicon, field, effect, transistors, the, mosfet, invented, at, bell, labs, between, 1955, and, 1960, made, it, possible, to, build, high, density, integrated, circuits, in, contrast, to, bipolar, transistors, which, required, a, number, of, steps, for, the, p, n, junction, isolation, of, transistors, on, a, chip, mosfets, required, no, such, steps, but, could, be, easily, isolated, from, each, other, its, advantage, for, integrated, circuits, was, pointed, out, by, dawon, kahng, in, 1961, the, list, of, ieee, milestones, includes, the, first, integrated, circuit, by, kilby, in, 1958, hoerni, s, planar, process, and, noyce, s, planar, ic, in, 1959, the, earliest, experimental, mos, ic, to, be, fabricated, was, a, 16, transistor, chip, built, by, fred, heiman, and, steven, hofstein, at, rca, in, 1962, general, microelectronics, later, introduced, the, first, commercial, mos, integrated, circuit, in, 1964, a, 120, transistor, shift, register, developed, by, robert, norman, by, 1964, mos, chips, had, reached, higher, transistor, density, and, lower, manufacturing, costs, than, bipolar, chips, mos, chips, further, increased, in, complexity, at, a, rate, predicted, by, moore, s, law, leading, to, large, scale, integration, lsi, with, hundreds, of, transistors, on, a, single, mos, chip, by, the, late, 1960s, following, the, development, of, the, self, aligned, gate, silicon, gate, mosfet, by, robert, kerwin, donald, klein, and, john, sarace, at, bell, labs, in, 1967, the, first, silicon, gate, mos, ic, technology, with, self, aligned, gates, the, basis, of, all, modern, cmos, integrated, circuits, was, developed, at, fairchild, semiconductor, by, federico, faggin, in, 1968, the, application, of, mos, lsi, chips, to, computing, was, the, basis, for, the, first, microprocessors, as, engineers, began, recognizing, that, a, complete, computer, processor, could, be, contained, on, a, single, mos, lsi, chip, this, led, to, the, inventions, of, the, microprocessor, and, the, microcontroller, by, the, early, 1970s, during, the, early, 1970s, mos, integrated, circuit, technology, enabled, the, very, large, scale, integration, vlsi, of, more, than, 10, 000, transistors, on, a, single, chip, at, first, mos, based, computers, only, made, sense, when, high, density, was, required, such, as, aerospace, and, pocket, calculators, computers, built, entirely, from, ttl, such, as, the, 1970, datapoint, 2200, were, much, faster, and, more, powerful, than, single, chip, mos, microprocessors, such, as, the, 1972, intel, 8008, until, the, early, 1980s, advances, in, ic, technology, primarily, smaller, features, and, larger, chips, have, allowed, the, number, of, mos, transistors, in, an, integrated, circuit, to, double, every, two, years, a, trend, known, as, moore, s, law, moore, originally, stated, it, would, double, every, year, but, he, went, on, to, change, the, claim, to, every, two, years, in, 1975, this, increased, capacity, has, been, used, to, decrease, cost, and, increase, functionality, in, general, as, the, feature, size, shrinks, almost, every, aspect, of, an, ic, s, operation, improves, the, cost, per, transistor, and, the, switching, power, consumption, per, transistor, goes, down, while, the, memory, capacity, and, speed, go, up, through, the, relationships, defined, by, dennard, scaling, mosfet, scaling, because, speed, capacity, and, power, consumption, gains, are, apparent, to, the, end, user, there, is, fierce, competition, among, the, manufacturers, to, use, finer, geometries, over, the, years, transistor, sizes, have, decreased, from, tens, of, microns, in, the, early, 1970s, to, 10, nanometers, in, 2017, with, a, corresponding, million, fold, increase, in, transistors, per, unit, area, as, of, 2016, typical, chip, areas, range, from, a, few, square, millimeters, to, around, 600, mm, 2, with, up, to, 25, million, transistors, per, mm, 2, the, expected, shrinking, of, feature, sizes, and, the, needed, progress, in, related, areas, was, forecast, for, many, years, by, the, international, technology, roadmap, for, semiconductors, itrs, the, final, itrs, was, issued, in, 2016, and, it, is, being, replaced, by, the, international, roadmap, for, devices, and, systems, initially, ics, were, strictly, electronic, devices, the, success, of, ics, has, led, to, the, integration, of, other, technologies, in, an, attempt, to, obtain, the, same, advantages, of, small, size, and, low, cost, these, technologies, include, mechanical, devices, optics, and, sensors, as, of, 2018, the, vast, majority, of, all, transistors, are, mosfets, fabricated, in, a, single, layer, on, one, side, of, a, chip, of, silicon, in, a, flat, two, dimensional, planar, process, researchers, have, produced, prototypes, of, several, promising, alternatives, such, as, as, it, becomes, more, difficult, to, manufacture, ever, smaller, transistors, companies, are, using, multi, chip, modules, chiplets, three, dimensional, integrated, circuits, package, on, package, high, bandwidth, memory, and, through, silicon, vias, with, die, stacking, to, increase, performance, and, reduce, size, without, having, to, reduce, the, size, of, the, transistors, such, techniques, are, collectively, known, as, advanced, packaging, advanced, packaging, is, mainly, divided, into, 2, 5d, and, 3d, packaging, 2, 5d, describes, approaches, such, as, multi, chip, modules, while, 3d, describes, approaches, where, dies, are, stacked, in, one, way, or, another, such, as, package, on, package, and, high, bandwidth, memory, all, approaches, involve, 2, or, more, dies, in, a, single, package, alternatively, approaches, such, as, 3d, nand, stack, multiple, layers, on, a, single, die, a, technique, has, been, demonstrated, to, include, microfluidic, cooling, on, integrated, circuits, to, improve, cooling, performance, as, well, as, peltier, thermoelectric, coolers, on, solder, bumps, or, thermal, solder, bumps, used, exclusively, for, heat, dissipation, used, in, flip, chip, the, cost, of, designing, and, developing, a, complex, integrated, circuit, is, quite, high, normally, in, the, multiple, tens, of, millions, of, dollars, therefore, it, only, makes, economic, sense, to, produce, integrated, circuit, products, with, high, production, volume, so, the, non, recurring, engineering, nre, costs, are, spread, across, typically, millions, of, production, units, modern, semiconductor, chips, have, billions, of, components, and, are, far, too, complex, to, be, designed, by, hand, software, tools, to, help, the, designer, are, essential, electronic, design, automation, eda, also, referred, to, as, electronic, computer, aided, design, ecad, is, a, category, of, software, tools, for, designing, electronic, systems, including, integrated, circuits, the, tools, work, together, in, a, design, flow, that, engineers, use, to, design, verify, and, analyze, entire, semiconductor, chips, some, of, the, latest, eda, tools, use, artificial, intelligence, ai, to, help, engineers, save, time, and, improve, chip, performance, integrated, circuits, can, be, broadly, classified, into, analog, digital, and, mixed, signal, consisting, of, analog, and, digital, signaling, on, the, same, ic, digital, integrated, circuits, can, contain, billions, of, logic, gates, flip, flops, multiplexers, and, other, circuits, in, a, few, square, millimeters, the, small, size, of, these, circuits, allows, high, speed, low, power, dissipation, and, reduced, manufacturing, cost, compared, with, board, level, integration, these, digital, ics, typically, microprocessors, dsps, and, microcontrollers, use, boolean, algebra, to, process, one, and, zero, signals, among, the, most, advanced, integrated, circuits, are, the, microprocessors, or, cores, used, in, personal, computers, cell, phones, microwave, ovens, etc, several, cores, may, be, integrated, together, in, a, single, ic, or, chip, digital, memory, chips, and, application, specific, integrated, circuits, asics, are, examples, of, other, families, of, integrated, circuits, in, the, 1980s, programmable, logic, devices, were, developed, these, devices, contain, circuits, whose, logical, function, and, connectivity, can, be, programmed, by, the, user, rather, than, being, fixed, by, the, integrated, circuit, manufacturer, this, allows, a, chip, to, be, programmed, to, do, various, lsi, type, functions, such, as, logic, gates, adders, and, registers, programmability, comes, in, various, forms, devices, that, can, be, programmed, only, once, devices, that, can, be, erased, and, then, re, programmed, using, uv, light, devices, that, can, be, re, programmed, using, flash, memory, and, field, programmable, gate, arrays, fpgas, which, can, be, programmed, at, any, time, including, during, operation, current, fpgas, can, as, of, 2016, implement, the, equivalent, of, millions, of, gates, and, operate, at, frequencies, up, to, 1, ghz, analog, ics, such, as, sensors, power, management, circuits, and, operational, amplifiers, op, amps, process, continuous, signals, and, perform, analog, functions, such, as, amplification, active, filtering, demodulation, and, mixing, ics, can, combine, analog, and, digital, circuits, on, a, chip, to, create, functions, such, as, analog, to, digital, converters, and, digital, to, analog, converters, such, mixed, signal, circuits, offer, smaller, size, and, lower, cost, but, must, account, for, signal, interference, prior, to, the, late, 1990s, radios, could, not, be, fabricated, in, the, same, low, cost, cmos, processes, as, microprocessors, but, since, 1998, radio, chips, have, been, developed, using, rf, cmos, processes, examples, include, intel, s, dect, cordless, phone, or, 802, 11, wi, fi, chips, created, by, atheros, and, other, companies, modern, electronic, component, distributors, often, further, sub, categorize, integrated, circuits, the, semiconductors, of, the, periodic, table, of, the, chemical, elements, were, identified, as, the, most, likely, materials, for, a, solid, state, vacuum, tube, starting, with, copper, oxide, proceeding, to, germanium, then, silicon, the, materials, were, systematically, studied, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, today, monocrystalline, silicon, is, the, main, substrate, used, for, ics, although, some, iii, v, compounds, of, the, periodic, table, such, as, gallium, arsenide, are, used, for, specialized, applications, like, leds, lasers, solar, cells, and, the, highest, speed, integrated, circuits, it, took, decades, to, perfect, methods, of, creating, crystals, with, minimal, defects, in, semiconducting, materials, crystal, structure, semiconductor, ics, are, fabricated, in, a, planar, process, which, includes, three, key, process, steps, photolithography, deposition, such, as, chemical, vapor, deposition, and, etching, the, main, process, steps, are, supplemented, by, doping, and, cleaning, more, recent, or, high, performance, ics, may, instead, use, multi, gate, finfet, or, gaafet, transistors, instead, of, planar, ones, starting, at, the, 22, nm, node, intel, or, 16, 14, nm, nodes, mono, crystal, silicon, wafers, are, used, in, most, applications, or, for, special, applications, other, semiconductors, such, as, gallium, arsenide, are, used, the, wafer, need, not, be, entirely, silicon, photolithography, is, used, to, mark, different, areas, of, the, substrate, to, be, doped, or, to, have, polysilicon, insulators, or, metal, typically, aluminium, or, copper, tracks, deposited, on, them, dopants, are, impurities, intentionally, introduced, to, a, semiconductor, to, modulate, its, electronic, properties, doping, is, the, process, of, adding, dopants, to, a, semiconductor, material, since, a, cmos, device, only, draws, current, on, the, transition, between, logic, states, cmos, devices, consume, much, less, current, than, bipolar, junction, transistor, devices, a, random, access, memory, is, the, most, regular, type, of, integrated, circuit, the, highest, density, devices, are, thus, memories, but, even, a, microprocessor, will, have, memory, on, the, chip, see, the, regular, array, structure, at, the, bottom, of, the, first, image, although, the, structures, are, intricate, with, widths, which, have, been, shrinking, for, decades, the, layers, remain, much, thinner, than, the, device, widths, the, layers, of, material, are, fabricated, much, like, a, photographic, process, although, light, waves, in, the, visible, spectrum, cannot, be, used, to, expose, a, layer, of, material, as, they, would, be, too, large, for, the, features, thus, photons, of, higher, frequencies, typically, ultraviolet, are, used, to, create, the, patterns, for, each, layer, because, each, feature, is, so, small, electron, microscopes, are, essential, tools, for, a, process, engineer, who, might, be, debugging, a, fabrication, process, each, device, is, tested, before, packaging, using, automated, test, equipment, ate, in, a, process, known, as, wafer, testing, or, wafer, probing, the, wafer, is, then, cut, into, rectangular, blocks, each, of, which, is, called, a, die, each, good, die, plural, dice, dies, or, die, is, then, connected, into, a, package, using, aluminium, or, gold, bond, wires, which, are, thermosonically, bonded, to, pads, usually, found, around, the, edge, of, the, die, thermosonic, bonding, was, first, introduced, by, a, coucoulas, which, provided, a, reliable, means, of, forming, these, vital, electrical, connections, to, the, outside, world, after, packaging, the, devices, go, through, final, testing, on, the, same, or, similar, ate, used, during, wafer, probing, industrial, ct, scanning, can, also, be, used, test, cost, can, account, for, over, 25, of, the, cost, of, fabrication, on, lower, cost, products, but, can, be, negligible, on, low, yielding, larger, or, higher, cost, devices, as, of, 2022, a, fabrication, facility, commonly, known, as, a, semiconductor, fab, can, cost, over, us, 12, billion, to, construct, the, cost, of, a, fabrication, facility, rises, over, time, because, of, increased, complexity, of, new, products, this, is, known, as, rock, s, law, such, a, facility, features, ics, can, be, manufactured, either, in, house, by, integrated, device, manufacturers, idms, or, using, the, foundry, model, idms, are, vertically, integrated, companies, like, intel, and, samsung, that, design, manufacture, and, sell, their, own, ics, and, may, offer, design, and, or, manufacturing, foundry, services, to, other, companies, the, latter, often, to, fabless, companies, in, the, foundry, model, fabless, companies, like, nvidia, only, design, and, sell, ics, and, outsource, all, manufacturing, to, pure, play, foundries, such, as, tsmc, these, foundries, may, offer, ic, design, services, the, earliest, integrated, circuits, were, packaged, in, ceramic, flat, packs, which, continued, to, be, used, by, the, military, for, their, reliability, and, small, size, for, many, years, commercial, circuit, packaging, quickly, moved, to, the, dual, in, line, package, dip, first, in, ceramic, and, later, in, plastic, which, is, commonly, cresol, formaldehyde, novolac, in, the, 1980s, pin, counts, of, vlsi, circuits, exceeded, the, practical, limit, for, dip, packaging, leading, to, pin, grid, array, pga, and, leadless, chip, carrier, lcc, packages, surface, mount, packaging, appeared, in, the, early, 1980s, and, became, popular, in, the, late, 1980s, using, finer, lead, pitch, with, leads, formed, as, either, gull, wing, or, j, lead, as, exemplified, by, the, small, outline, integrated, circuit, soic, package, a, carrier, which, occupies, an, area, about, 30, 50, less, than, an, equivalent, dip, and, is, typically, 70, thinner, this, package, has, gull, wing, leads, protruding, from, the, two, long, sides, and, a, lead, spacing, of, 0, 050, inches, in, the, late, 1990s, plastic, quad, flat, pack, pqfp, and, thin, small, outline, package, tsop, packages, became, the, most, common, for, high, pin, count, devices, though, pga, packages, are, still, used, for, high, end, microprocessors, ball, grid, array, bga, packages, have, existed, since, the, 1970s, flip, chip, ball, grid, array, packages, which, allow, for, a, much, higher, pin, count, than, other, package, types, were, developed, in, the, 1990s, in, an, fcbga, package, the, die, is, mounted, upside, down, flipped, and, connects, to, the, package, balls, via, a, package, substrate, that, is, similar, to, a, printed, circuit, board, rather, than, by, wires, fcbga, packages, allow, an, array, of, input, output, signals, called, area, i, o, to, be, distributed, over, the, entire, die, rather, than, being, confined, to, the, die, periphery, bga, devices, have, the, advantage, of, not, needing, a, dedicated,

server, microprocessors, use, lga, packages, electrical, signals, leaving, the, die, must, pass, through, the, material, electrically, connecting, the, die, to, the, package, through, the, conductive, traces, paths, in, the, package, through, the, leads, connecting, the, package, to, the, conductive, traces, on, the, printed, circuit, board, the, materials, and, structures, used, in, the, path, these, electrical, signals, must, travel, have, very, different, electrical, properties, compared, to, those, that, travel, to, different, parts, of, the, same, die, as, a, result, they, require, special, design, techniques, to, ensure, the, signals, are, not, corrupted, and, much, more, electric, power, than, signals, confined, to, the, die, itself, when, multiple, dies, are, put, in, one, package, the, result, is, a, system, in, package, abbreviated, sip, a, multi, chip, module, mcm, is, created, by, combining, multiple, dies, on, a, small, substrate, often, made, of, ceramic, the, distinction, between, a, large, mcm, and, a, small, printed, circuit, board, is, sometimes, fuzzy, packaged, integrated, circuits, are, usually, large, enough, to, include, identifying, information, four, common, sections, are, the, manufacturer, s, name, or, logo, the, part, number, a, part, production, batch, number, and, serial, number, and, a, four, digit, date, code, to, identify, when, the, chip, was, manufactured, extremely, small, surface, mount, technology, parts, often, bear, only, a, number, used, in, a, manufacturer, s, lookup, table, to, find, the, integrated, circuit, s, characteristics, the, manufacturing, date, is, commonly, represented, as, a, two, digit, year, followed, by, a, two, digit, week, code, such, that, a, part, bearing, the, code, 8341, was, manufactured, in, week, 41, of, 1983, or, approximately, in, october, 1983, the, possibility, of, copying, by, photographing, each, layer, of, an, integrated, circuit, and, preparing, photomasks, for, its, production, on, the, basis, of, the, photographs, obtained, is, a, reason, for, the, introduction, of, legislation, for, the, protection, of, layout, designs, the, us, semiconductor, chip, protection, act, of, 1984, established, intellectual, property, protection, for, photomasks, used, to, produce, integrated, circuits, a, diplomatic, conference, held, at, washington, d, c, in, 1989, adopted, a, treaty, on, intellectual, property, in, respect, of, integrated, circuits, also, called, the, washington, treaty, or, ipic, treaty, the, treaty, is, currently, not, in, force, but, was, partially, integrated, into, the, trips, agreement, there, are, several, united, states, patents, connected, to, the, integrated, circuit, which, include, patents, by, j, s, kilby, us3, 138, 743, us3, 261, 081, us3, 434, 015, and, by, r, f, stewart, us3, 138, 747, national, laws, protecting, ic, layout, designs, have, been, adopted, in, a, number, of, countries, including, japan, the, ec, the, uk, australia, and, korea, the, uk, enacted, the, copyright, designs, and, patents, act, 1988, c, 48, 213, after, it, initially, took, the, position, that, its, copyright, law, fully, protected, chip, topographies, see, british, leyland, motor, corp, v, armstrong, patents, co, criticisms, of, inadequacy, of, the, uk, copyright, approach, as, perceived, by, the, us, chip, industry, are, summarized, in, further, chip, rights, developments, australia, passed, the, circuit, layouts, act, of, 1989, as, a, sui, generis, form, of, chip, protection, korea, passed, the, act, concerning, the, layout, design, of, semiconductor, integrated, circuits, in, 1992, in, the, early, days, of, simple, integrated, circuits, the, technology, s, large, scale, limited, each, chip, to, only, a, few, transistors, and, the, low, degree, of, integration, meant, the, design, process, was, relatively, simple, manufacturing, yields, were, also, quite, low, by, today, s, standards, as, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, technology, progressed, millions, and, then, billions, of, mos, transistors, could, be, placed, on, one, chip, and, good, designs, required, thorough, planning, giving, rise, to, the, field, of, electronic, design, automation, or, eda, some, ssi, and, msi, chips, like, discrete, transistors, are, still, mass, produced, both, to, maintain, old, equipment, and, build, new, devices, that, require, only, a, few, gates, the, 7400, series, of, ttl, chips, for, example, has, become, a, de, facto, standard, and, remains, in, production, the, first, integrated, circuits, contained, only, a, few, transistors, early, digital, circuits, containing, tens, of, transistors, provided, a, few, logic, gates, and, early, linear, ics, such, as, the, plessey, sl201, or, the, philips, taa320, had, as, few, as, two, transistors, the, number, of, transistors, in, an, integrated, circuit, has, increased, dramatically, since, then, the, term, large, scale, integration, lsi, was, first, used, by, ibm, scientist, rolf, landauer, when, describing, the, theoretical, concept, that, term, gave, rise, to, the, terms, small, scale, integration, ssi, medium, scale, integration, msi, very, large, scale, integration, vlsi, and, ultra, large, scale, integration, ulsi, the, early, integrated, circuits, were, ssi, ssi, circuits, were, crucial, to, early, aerospace, projects, and, aerospace, projects, helped, inspire, development, of, the, technology, both, the, minuteman, missile, and, apollo, program, needed, lightweight, digital, computers, for, their, inertial, guidance, systems, although, the, apollo, guidance, computer, led, and, motivated, integrated, circuit, technology, it, was, the, minuteman, missile, that, forced, it, into, mass, production, the, minuteman, missile, program, and, various, other, united, states, navy, programs, accounted, for, the, total, 4, million, integrated, circuit, market, in, 1962, and, by, 1968, u, s, government, spending, on, space, and, defense, still, accounted, for, 37, of, the, 312, million, total, production, the, demand, by, the, u, s, government, supported, the, nascent, integrated, circuit, market, until, costs, fell, enough, to, allow, ic, firms, to, penetrate, the, industrial, market, and, eventually, the, consumer, market, the, average, price, per, integrated, circuit, dropped, from, 50, 00, in, 1962, to, 2, 33, in, 1968, integrated, circuits, began, to, appear, in, consumer, products, by, the, turn, of, the, 1970s, decade, a, typical, application, was, fm, inter, carrier, sound, processing, in, television, receivers, the, first, application, mos, chips, were, small, scale, integration, ssi, chips, following, mohamed, m, atalla, s, proposal, of, the, mos, integrated, circuit, chip, in, 1960, the, earliest, experimental, mos, chip, to, be, fabricated, was, a, 16, transistor, chip, built, by, fred, heiman, and, steven, hofstein, at, rca, in, 1962, the, first, practical, application, of, mos, ssi, chips, was, for, nasa, satellites, the, next, step, in, the, development, of, integrated, circuits, introduced, devices, which, contained, hundreds, of, transistors, on, each, chip, called, medium, scale, integration, msi, mosfet, scaling, technology, made, it, possible, to, build, high, density, chips, by, 1964, mos, chips, had, reached, higher, transistor, density, and, lower, manufacturing, costs, than, bipolar, chips, in, 1964, frank, wanlass, demonstrated, a, single, chip, 16, bit, shift, register, he, designed, with, a, then, incredible, 120, mos, transistors, on, a, single, chip, the, same, year, general, microelectronics, introduced, the, first, commercial, mos, integrated, circuit, chip, consisting, of, 120, p, channel, mos, transistors, it, was, a, 20, bit, shift, register, developed, by, robert, norman, and, frank, wanlass, mos, chips, further, increased, in, complexity, at, a, rate, predicted, by, moore, s, law, leading, to, chips, with, hundreds, of, mosfets, on, a, chip, by, the, late, 1960s, further, development, driven, by, the, same, mosfet, scaling, technology, and, economic, factors, led, to, large, scale, integration, lsi, by, the, mid, 1970s, with, tens, of, thousands, of, transistors, per, chip, the, masks, used, to, process, and, manufacture, ssi, msi, and, early, lsi, and, vlsi, devices, such, as, the, microprocessors, of, the, early, 1970s, were, mostly, created, by, hand, often, using, rubylith, tape, or, similar, for, large, or, complex, ics, such, as, memories, or, processors, this, was, often, done, by, specially, hired, professionals, in, charge, of, circuit, layout, placed, under, the, supervision, of, a, team, of, engineers, who, would, also, along, with, the, circuit, designers, inspect, and, verify, the, correctness, and, completeness, of, each, mask, integrated, circuits, such, as, 1k, bit, rams, calculator, chips, and, the, first, microprocessors, that, began, to, be, manufactured, in, moderate, quantities, in, the, early, 1970s, had, under, 4, 000, transistors, true, lsi, circuits, approaching, 10, 000, transistors, began, to, be, produced, around, 1974, for, computer, main, memories, and, second, generation, microprocessors, very, large, scale, integration, vlsi, is, a, development, started, with, hundreds, of, thousands, of, transistors, in, the, early, 1980s, and, as, of, 2023, transistor, counts, continue, to, grow, beyond, 5, 3, trillion, transistors, per, chip, multiple, developments, were, required, to, achieve, this, increased, density, manufacturers, moved, to, smaller, mosfet, design, rules, and, cleaner, fabrication, facilities, the, path, of, process, improvements, was, summarized, by, the, international, technology, roadmap, for, semiconductors, itrs, which, has, since, been, succeeded, by, the, international, roadmap, for, devices, and, systems, irds, electronic, design, tools, improved, making, it, practical, to, finish, designs, in, a, reasonable, time, the, more, energy, efficient, cmos, replaced, nmos, and, pmos, avoiding, a, prohibitive, increase, in, power, consumption, the, complexity, and, density, of, modern, vlsi, devices, made, it, no, longer, feasible, to, check, the, masks, or, do, the, original, design, by, hand, instead, engineers, use, eda, tools, to, perform, most, functional, verification, work, in, 1986, one, megabit, random, access, memory, ram, chips, were, introduced, containing, more, than, one, million, transistors, microprocessor, chips, passed, the, million, transistor, mark, in, 1989, and, the, billion, transistor, mark, in, 2005, the, trend, continues, largely, unabated, with, chips, introduced, in, 2007, containing, tens, of, billions, of, memory, transistors, to, reflect, further, growth, of, the, complexity, the, term, ulsi, that, stands, for, ultra, large, scale, integration, was, proposed, for, chips, of, more, than, 1, million, transistors, wafer, scale, integration, wsi, is, a, means, of, building, very, large, integrated, circuits, that, uses, an, entire, silicon, wafer, to, produce, a, single, super, chip, through, a, combination, of, large, size, and, reduced, packaging, wsi, could, lead, to, dramatically, reduced, costs, for, some, systems, notably, massively, parallel, supercomputers, the, name, is, taken, from, the, term, very, large, scale, integration, the, current, state, of, the, art, when, wsi, was, being, developed, a, system, on, a, chip, soc, or, soc, is, an, integrated, circuit, in, which, all, the, components, needed, for, a, computer, or, other, system, are, included, on, a, single, chip, the, design, of, such, a, device, can, be, complex, and, costly, and, whilst, performance, benefits, can, be, had, from, integrating, all, needed, components, on, one, die, the, cost, of, licensing, and, developing, a, one, die, machine, still, outweigh, having, separate, devices, with, appropriate, licensing, these, drawbacks, are, offset, by, lower, manufacturing, and, assembly, costs, and, by, a, greatly, reduced, power, budget, because, signals, among, the, components, are, kept, on, die, much, less, power, is, required, see, packaging, further, signal, sources, and, destinations, are, physically, closer, on, die, reducing, the, length, of, wiring, and, therefore, latency, transmission, power, costs, and, waste, heat, from, communication, between, modules, on, the, same, chip, this, has, led, to, an, exploration, of, so, called, network, on, chip, noc, devices, which, apply, system, on, chip, design, methodologies, to, digital, communication, networks, as, opposed, to, traditional, bus, architectures, a, three, dimensional, integrated, circuit, 3d, ic, has, two, or, more, layers, of, active, electronic, components, that, are, integrated, both, vertically, and, horizontally, into, a, single, circuit, communication, between, layers, uses, on, die, signaling, so, power, consumption, is, much, lower, than, in, equivalent, separate, circuits, judicious, use, of, short, vertical, wires, can, substantially, reduce, overall, wire, length, for, faster, operation, to, allow, identification, during, production, most, silicon, chips, will, have, a, serial, number, in, one, corner, it, is, also, common, to, add, the, manufacturer, s, logo, ever, since, ics, were, created, some, chip, designers, have, used, the, silicon, surface, area, for, surreptitious, non, functional, images, or, words, these, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, chip, art, silicon, art, silicon, graffiti, or, silicon, doodling
