an, oven, is, a, tool, which, is, used, to, expose, materials, to, a, hot, environment, ovens, contain, a, hollow, chamber, and, provide, a, means, of, heating, the, chamber, in, a, controlled, way, in, use, since, antiquity, they, have, been, used, to, accomplish, a, wide, variety, of, tasks, requiring, controlled, heating, because, they, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, there, are, many, different, types, of, ovens, these, types, differ, depending, on, their, intended, purpose, and, based, upon, how, they, generate, heat, ovens, are, often, used, for, cooking, where, they, can, be, used, to, heat, food, to, a, desired, temperature, ovens, are, also, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, ceramics, and, pottery, these, ovens, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, kilns, metallurgical, furnaces, are, ovens, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, metals, while, glass, furnaces, are, ovens, used, to, produce, glass, there, are, many, methods, by, which, different, types, of, ovens, produce, heat, some, ovens, heat, materials, using, the, combustion, of, a, fuel, such, as, wood, coal, or, natural, gas, while, many, employ, electricity, microwave, ovens, heat, materials, by, exposing, them, to, microwave, radiation, while, electric, ovens, and, electric, furnaces, heat, materials, using, resistive, heating, some, ovens, use, forced, convection, the, movement, of, gases, inside, the, heating, chamber, to, enhance, the, heating, process, or, in, some, cases, to, change, the, properties, of, the, material, being, heated, such, as, in, the, bessemer, method, of, steel, production, the, earliest, ovens, were, found, in, central, europe, and, date, back, to, 29, 000, bc, they, were, roasting, and, boiling, pits, inside, yurts, used, to, cook, mammoth, in, ukraine, from, 20, 000, bc, they, used, pits, with, hot, coals, covered, in, ashes, the, food, was, wrapped, in, leaves, and, set, on, top, then, covered, with, earth, in, camps, found, in, mezhirich, each, mammoth, bone, house, had, a, hearth, used, for, heating, and, cooking, ovens, were, used, by, cultures, who, lived, in, the, indus, valley, and, in, pre, dynastic, egypt, by, 3200, bc, each, mud, brick, house, had, an, oven, in, settlements, across, the, indus, valley, ovens, were, used, to, cook, food, and, to, make, bricks, pre, dynastic, civilizations, in, egypt, used, kilns, around, 5000, 4000, bc, to, make, pottery, tand, r, ovens, used, to, bake, unleavened, flatbread, were, common, in, anatolia, during, the, seljuk, and, ottoman, eras, and, have, been, found, at, archaeological, sites, distributed, across, the, middle, east, the, word, tand, r, comes, from, the, akkadian, tinuru, which, becomes, tanur, in, hebrew, and, arabic, and, tand, r, in, turkish, of, the, hundreds, of, bread, varieties, known, from, cuneiform, sources, unleavened, tinuru, bread, was, made, by, adhering, bread, to, the, side, walls, of, a, heated, cylindrical, oven, this, type, of, bread, is, still, central, to, rural, food, culture, in, this, part, of, the, world, reflected, by, the, local, folklore, where, a, young, man, and, woman, sharing, fresh, tand, r, bread, is, a, symbol, of, young, love, however, the, culture, of, traditional, bread, baking, is, changing, with, younger, generations, especially, with, those, who, reside, in, towns, showing, a, preference, for, modern, conveniences, during, the, middle, ages, instead, of, earth, and, ceramic, ovens, europeans, used, fireplaces, in, conjunction, with, large, cauldrons, these, were, similar, to, the, dutch, oven, following, the, middle, ages, ovens, underwent, many, changes, over, time, from, wood, iron, coal, gas, and, even, electric, each, design, had, its, own, motivation, and, purpose, the, wood, burning, stoves, saw, improvement, through, the, addition, of, fire, chambers, that, allowed, better, containment, and, release, of, smoke, another, recognizable, oven, would, be, the, cast, iron, stove, these, were, first, used, around, the, early, 1700s, when, they, themselves, underwent, several, variations, including, the, stewart, oberlin, iron, stove, that, was, smaller, and, had, its, own, chimney, in, the, early, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, coal, oven, was, developed, it, was, cylindrical, in, shape, and, made, of, heavy, cast, iron, the, gas, oven, saw, its, first, use, as, early, as, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, as, well, gas, stoves, became, very, common, household, ovens, once, gas, lines, were, available, to, most, houses, and, neighborhoods, james, sharp, patented, one, of, the, first, gas, stoves, in, 1826, other, various, improvements, to, the, gas, stove, included, the, aga, cooker, invented, in, 1922, by, gustaf, dal, n, the, first, electric, ovens, were, invented, in, the, very, late, 19th, century, however, like, many, electrical, inventions, destined, for, commercial, use, mass, ownership, of, electrical, ovens, could, not, be, a, reality, until, better, and, more, efficient, use, of, electricity, was, available, more, recently, ovens, have, become, slightly, more, high, tech, in, terms, of, cooking, strategy, the, microwave, as, a, cooking, tool, was, discovered, by, percy, spencer, in, 1946, and, with, the, help, from, engineers, the, microwave, oven, was, patented, the, microwave, oven, uses, microwave, radiation, to, excite, the, water, molecules, in, food, causing, friction, thus, producing, heat, some, ovens, can, perform, in, multiple, ways, sometimes, at, once, combination, ovens, may, be, able, to, microwave, and, conventional, heating, such, as, baking, or, grilling, simultaneously, ovens, are, used, as, kitchen, appliances, for, roasting, and, heating, foods, normally, cooked, in, this, manner, include, meat, casseroles, and, baked, goods, such, as, bread, cake, and, other, desserts, in, modern, times, the, oven, is, used, to, cook, and, heat, food, in, many, households, around, the, globe, modern, ovens, are, typically, fueled, by, either, natural, gas, or, electricity, with, bottle, gas, models, available, but, not, common, when, an, oven, is, contained, in, a, complete, stove, the, fuel, used, for, the, oven, may, be, the, same, as, or, different, from, the, fuel, used, for, the, burners, on, top, of, the, stove, ovens, usually, can, use, a, variety, of, methods, to, cook, the, most, common, may, be, to, heat, the, oven, from, below, this, is, commonly, used, for, baking, and, roasting, the, oven, may, also, be, able, to, heat, from, the, top, to, provide, broiling, us, or, grilling, uk, commonwealth, a, fan, assisted, oven, that, uses, a, small, fan, to, circulate, the, air, in, the, cooking, chamber, can, be, used, both, are, also, known, as, convection, ovens, an, oven, may, also, provide, an, integrated, rotisserie, ovens, also, vary, in, the, way, that, they, are, controlled, the, simplest, ovens, for, example, the, aga, cooker, may, not, have, any, controls, at, all, the, ovens, simply, run, continuously, at, various, temperatures, more, conventional, ovens, have, a, simple, thermostat, which, turns, the, oven, on, and, off, and, selects, the, temperature, at, which, it, will, operate, set, to, the, highest, setting, this, may, also, enable, the, broiler, element, a, timer, may, allow, the, oven, to, be, turned, on, and, off, automatically, at, pre, set, times, more, sophisticated, ovens, may, have, complex, computer, based, controls, allowing, a, wide, variety, of, operating, modes, and, special, features, including, the, use, of, a, temperature, probe, to, automatically, shut, the, oven, off, when, the, food, is, completely, cooked, to, the, desired, degree, toaster, ovens, are, essentially, small, scale, ovens, and, can, be, used, to, cook, foods, other, than, just, toasting, a, frontal, door, is, opened, horizontally, oriented, bread, slices, or, other, food, items, are, placed, on, a, rack, that, has, heat, elements, above, and, below, it, and, the, door, is, closed, the, controls, are, set, and, actuated, to, toast, the, bread, to, the, desired, doneness, whereupon, the, heat, elements, are, switched, off, in, most, cases, the, door, must, be, opened, manually, though, there, are, also, toaster, ovens, with, doors, that, open, automatically, because, the, bread, is, horizontal, a, toaster, oven, can, be, used, to, cook, toast, with, toppings, like, garlic, bread, melt, sandwiches, or, toasted, cheese, toaster, ovens, are, generally, slower, to, make, toast, than, pop, up, toasters, taking, 4, 6, minutes, as, compared, to, 2, 3, minutes, in, addition, to, the, automatic, toasting, settings, toaster, ovens, typically, have, settings, and, temperature, controls, to, allow, use, of, the, appliance, as, a, small, oven, extra, features, on, toaster, ovens, can, include, outside, the, culinary, world, ovens, are, used, for, a, number, of, purposes
