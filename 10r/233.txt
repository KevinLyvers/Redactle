a, well, is, an, excavation, or, structure, created, in, the, earth, by, digging, driving, or, drilling, to, access, liquid, resources, usually, water, the, oldest, and, most, common, kind, of, well, is, a, water, well, to, access, groundwater, in, underground, aquifers, the, well, water, is, drawn, up, by, a, pump, or, using, containers, such, as, buckets, or, large, water, bags, that, are, raised, mechanically, or, by, hand, water, can, also, be, injected, back, into, the, aquifer, through, the, well, wells, were, first, constructed, at, least, eight, thousand, years, ago, and, historically, vary, in, construction, from, a, simple, scoop, in, the, sediment, of, a, dry, watercourse, to, the, qanats, of, iran, and, the, stepwells, and, sakiehs, of, india, placing, a, lining, in, the, well, shaft, helps, create, stability, and, linings, of, wood, or, wickerwork, date, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, iron, age, wells, have, traditionally, been, sunk, by, hand, digging, as, is, still, the, case, in, rural, areas, of, the, developing, world, these, wells, are, inexpensive, and, low, tech, as, they, use, mostly, manual, labour, and, the, structure, can, be, lined, with, brick, or, stone, as, the, excavation, proceeds, a, more, modern, method, called, caissoning, uses, pre, cast, reinforced, concrete, well, rings, that, are, lowered, into, the, hole, driven, wells, can, be, created, in, unconsolidated, material, with, a, well, hole, structure, which, consists, of, a, hardened, drive, point, and, a, screen, of, perforated, pipe, after, which, a, pump, is, installed, to, collect, the, water, deeper, wells, can, be, excavated, by, hand, drilling, methods, or, machine, drilling, using, a, bit, in, a, borehole, drilled, wells, are, usually, cased, with, a, factory, made, pipe, composed, of, steel, or, plastic, drilled, wells, can, access, water, at, much, greater, depths, than, dug, wells, two, broad, classes, of, well, are, shallow, or, unconfined, wells, completed, within, the, uppermost, saturated, aquifer, at, that, location, and, deep, or, confined, wells, sunk, through, an, impermeable, stratum, into, an, aquifer, beneath, a, collector, well, can, be, constructed, adjacent, to, a, freshwater, lake, or, stream, with, water, percolating, through, the, intervening, material, the, site, of, a, well, can, be, selected, by, a, hydrogeologist, or, groundwater, surveyor, water, may, be, pumped, or, hand, drawn, impurities, from, the, surface, can, easily, reach, shallow, sources, and, contamination, of, the, supply, by, pathogens, or, chemical, contaminants, needs, to, be, avoided, well, water, typically, contains, more, minerals, in, solution, than, surface, water, and, may, require, treatment, before, being, potable, soil, salination, can, occur, as, the, water, table, falls, and, the, surrounding, soil, begins, to, dry, out, another, environmental, problem, is, the, potential, for, methane, to, seep, into, the, water, very, early, neolithic, wells, are, known, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, oldest, reliably, dated, well, is, from, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, ppn, site, of, kissonerga, mylouthkia, on, cyprus, at, around, 8400, bc, a, shaft, well, 116, of, circular, diameter, was, driven, through, limestone, to, reach, an, aquifer, at, a, depth, of, 8, metres, 26, ft, well, 2070, from, kissonerga, mylouthkia, dating, to, the, late, ppn, reaches, a, depth, of, 13, metres, 43, ft, other, slightly, younger, wells, are, known, from, this, site, and, from, neighbouring, parekklisha, shillourokambos, a, first, stone, lined, well, of, 5, 5, metres, 18, ft, depth, is, documented, from, a, drowned, final, ppn, c, 7000, bc, site, at, atlit, yam, off, the, coast, near, modern, haifa, in, israel, wood, lined, wells, are, known, from, the, early, neolithic, linear, pottery, culture, for, example, in, ostrov, czech, republic, dated, 5265, bc, k, ckhoven, an, outlying, centre, of, erkelenz, dated, 5300, bc, and, eythra, in, schletz, an, outlying, centre, of, asparn, an, der, zaya, in, austria, dated, 5200, bc, the, neolithic, chinese, discovered, and, made, extensive, use, of, deep, drilled, groundwater, for, drinking, the, chinese, text, the, book, of, changes, originally, a, divination, text, of, the, western, zhou, dynasty, 1046, 771, bc, contains, an, entry, describing, how, the, ancient, chinese, maintained, their, wells, and, protected, their, sources, of, water, a, well, excavated, at, the, hemedu, excavation, site, was, believed, to, have, been, built, during, the, neolithic, era, the, well, was, cased, by, four, rows, of, logs, with, a, square, frame, attached, to, them, at, the, top, of, the, well, 60, additional, tile, wells, southwest, of, beijing, are, also, believed, to, have, been, built, around, 600, bc, for, drinking, and, irrigation, in, egypt, shadoofs, and, sakias, are, used, the, sakia, is, much, more, efficient, as, it, can, bring, up, water, from, a, depth, of, 10, metres, versus, the, 3, metres, of, the, shadoof, the, sakia, is, the, egyptian, version, of, the, noria, some, of, the, world, s, oldest, known, wells, located, in, cyprus, date, to, 7000, 8, 500, bc, two, wells, from, the, neolithic, period, around, 6500, bc, have, been, discovered, in, israel, one, is, in, atlit, on, the, northern, coast, of, israel, and, the, other, is, in, the, jezreel, valley, wells, for, other, purposes, came, along, much, later, historically, the, first, recorded, salt, well, was, dug, in, the, sichuan, province, of, china, around, 2, 250, years, ago, this, was, the, first, time, that, ancient, water, well, technology, was, applied, successfully, for, the, exploitation, of, salt, and, marked, the, beginning, of, sichuan, s, salt, drilling, industry, the, earliest, known, oil, wells, were, also, drilled, in, china, in, 347, ce, these, wells, had, depths, of, up, to, about, 240, metres, 790, ft, and, were, drilled, using, bits, attached, to, bamboo, poles, the, oil, was, burned, to, evaporate, brine, and, produce, salt, by, the, 10th, century, extensive, bamboo, pipelines, connected, oil, wells, with, salt, springs, the, ancient, records, of, china, and, japan, are, said, to, contain, many, allusions, to, the, use, of, natural, gas, for, lighting, and, heating, petroleum, was, known, as, burning, water, in, japan, in, the, 7th, century, until, recent, centuries, all, artificial, wells, were, pumpless, hand, dug, wells, of, varying, degrees, of, sophistication, and, they, remain, a, very, important, source, of, potable, water, in, some, rural, developing, areas, where, they, are, routinely, dug, and, used, today, their, indispensability, has, produced, a, number, of, literary, references, literal, and, figurative, including, the, reference, to, the, incident, of, jesus, meeting, a, woman, at, jacob, s, well, john, 4, 6, in, the, bible, and, the, ding, dong, bell, nursery, rhyme, about, a, cat, in, a, well, hand, dug, wells, are, excavations, with, diameters, large, enough, to, accommodate, one, or, more, people, with, shovels, digging, down, to, below, the, water, table, the, excavation, is, braced, horizontally, to, avoid, landslide, or, erosion, endangering, the, people, digging, they, can, be, lined, with, stone, or, brick, extending, this, lining, upwards, above, the, ground, surface, to, form, a, wall, around, the, well, serves, to, reduce, both, contamination, and, accidental, falls, into, the, well, a, more, modern, method, called, caissoning, uses, reinforced, concrete, or, plain, concrete, pre, cast, well, rings, that, are, lowered, into, the, hole, a, well, digging, team, digs, under, a, cutting, ring, and, the, well, column, slowly, sinks, into, the, aquifer, whilst, protecting, the, team, from, collapse, of, the, well, bore, hand, dug, wells, are, inexpensive, and, low, tech, compared, to, drilling, and, they, use, mostly, manual, labour, to, access, groundwater, in, rural, locations, of, developing, countries, they, may, be, built, with, a, high, degree, of, community, participation, or, by, local, entrepreneurs, who, specialize, in, hand, dug, wells, they, have, been, successfully, excavated, to, 60, metres, 200, ft, they, have, low, operational, and, maintenance, costs, in, part, because, water, can, be, extracted, by, hand, without, a, pump, the, water, often, comes, from, an, aquifer, or, groundwater, and, can, be, easily, deepened, which, may, be, necessary, if, the, ground, water, level, drops, by, telescoping, the, lining, further, down, into, the, aquifer, the, yield, of, existing, hand, dug, wells, may, be, improved, by, deepening, or, introducing, vertical, tunnels, or, perforated, pipes, drawbacks, to, hand, dug, wells, are, numerous, it, can, be, impractical, to, hand, dig, wells, in, areas, where, hard, rock, is, present, and, they, can, be, time, consuming, to, dig, and, line, even, in, favourable, areas, because, they, exploit, shallow, aquifers, the, well, may, be, susceptible, to, yield, fluctuations, and, possible, contamination, from, surface, water, including, sewage, hand, dug, well, construction, generally, requires, the, use, of, a, well, trained, construction, team, and, the, capital, investment, for, equipment, such, as, concrete, ring, moulds, heavy, lifting, equipment, well, shaft, formwork, motorized, de, watering, pumps, and, fuel, can, be, large, for, people, in, developing, countries, construction, of, hand, dug, wells, can, be, dangerous, due, to, collapse, of, the, well, bore, falling, objects, and, asphyxiation, including, from, dewatering, pump, exhaust, fumes, the, woodingdean, water, well, hand, dug, between, 1858, and, 1862, is, the, deepest, hand, dug, well, at, 392, metres, 1, 285, ft, the, big, well, in, greensburg, kansas, is, billed, as, the, world, s, largest, hand, dug, well, at, 109, feet, 33, m, deep, and, 32, feet, 9, 8, m, in, diameter, however, the, well, of, joseph, in, the, cairo, citadel, at, 280, feet, 85, m, deep, and, the, pozzo, di, san, patrizio, st, patrick, s, well, built, in, 1527, in, orvieto, italy, at, 61, metres, 200, ft, deep, by, 13, metres, 43, ft, wide, are, both, larger, by, volume, driven, wells, may, be, very, simply, created, in, unconsolidated, material, with, a, well, hole, structure, which, consists, of, a, hardened, drive, point, and, a, screen, perforated, pipe, the, point, is, simply, hammered, into, the, ground, usually, with, a, tripod, and, driver, with, pipe, sections, added, as, needed, a, driver, is, a, weighted, pipe, that, slides, over, the, pipe, being, driven, and, is, repeatedly, dropped, on, it, when, groundwater, is, encountered, the, well, is, washed, of, sediment, and, a, pump, installed, drilled, wells, are, constructed, using, various, types, of, drilling, machines, such, as, top, head, rotary, table, rotary, or, cable, tool, which, all, use, drilling, stems, that, rotate, to, cut, into, the, formation, thus, the, term, drilling, drilled, wells, can, be, excavated, by, simple, hand, drilling, methods, augering, sludging, jetting, driving, hand, percussion, or, machine, drilling, auger, rotary, percussion, down, the, hole, hammer, deep, rock, rotary, drilling, method, is, most, common, rotary, can, be, used, in, 90, of, formation, types, consolidated, drilled, wells, can, get, water, from, a, much, deeper, level, than, dug, wells, can, often, down, to, several, hundred, metres, drilled, wells, with, electric, pumps, are, used, throughout, the, world, typically, in, rural, or, sparsely, populated, areas, though, many, urban, areas, are, supplied, partly, by, municipal, wells, most, shallow, well, drilling, machines, are, mounted, on, large, trucks, trailers, or, tracked, vehicle, carriages, water, wells, typically, range, from, 3, to, 18, metres, 10, 60, ft, deep, but, in, some, areas, it, can, go, deeper, than, 900, metres, 3, 000, ft, rotary, drilling, machines, use, a, segmented, steel, drilling, string, typically, made, up, of, 3m, 10ft, 6, m, 20, ft, to, 8m, 26ft, sections, of, steel, tubing, that, are, threaded, together, with, a, bit, or, other, drilling, device, at, the, bottom, end, some, rotary, drilling, machines, are, designed, to, install, by, driving, or, drilling, a, steel, casing, into, the, well, in, conjunction, with, the, drilling, of, the, actual, bore, hole, air, and, or, water, is, used, as, a, circulation, fluid, to, displace, cuttings, and, cool, bits, during, the, drilling, another, form, of, rotary, style, drilling, termed, mud, rotary, makes, use, of, a, specially, made, mud, or, drilling, fluid, which, is, constantly, being, altered, during, the, drill, so, that, it, can, consistently, create, enough, hydraulic, pressure, to, hold, the, side, walls, of, the, bore, hole, open, regardless, of, the, presence, of, a, casing, in, the, well, typically, boreholes, drilled, into, solid, rock, are, not, cased, until, after, the, drilling, process, is, completed, regardless, of, the, machinery, used, the, oldest, form, of, drilling, machinery, is, the, cable, tool, still, used, today, specifically, designed, to, raise, and, lower, a, bit, into, the, bore, hole, the, spudding, of, the, drill, causes, the, bit, to, be, raised, and, dropped, onto, the, bottom, of, the, hole, and, the, design, of, the, cable, causes, the, bit, to, twist, at, approximately, 1, 4, revolution, per, drop, thereby, creating, a, drilling, action, unlike, rotary, drilling, cable, tool, drilling, requires, the, drilling, action, to, be, stopped, so, that, the, bore, hole, can, be, bailed, or, emptied, of, drilled, cuttings, cable, tool, drilling, rigs, are, rare, as, they, tend, to, be, 10x, slower, to, drill, through, materials, compared, to, similar, diameter, rotary, air, or, rotary, mud, equipped, rigs, drilled, wells, are, usually, cased, with, a, factory, made, pipe, typically, steel, in, air, rotary, or, cable, tool, drilling, or, plastic, pvc, in, mud, rotary, wells, also, present, in, wells, drilled, into, solid, rock, the, casing, is, constructed, by, welding, either, chemically, or, thermally, segments, of, casing, together, if, the, casing, is, installed, during, the, drilling, most, drills, will, drive, the, casing, into, the, ground, as, the, bore, hole, advances, while, some, newer, machines, will, actually, allow, for, the, casing, to, be, rotated, and, drilled, into, the, formation, in, a, similar, manner, as, the, bit, advancing, just, below, pvc, or, plastic, is, typically, solvent, welded, and, then, lowered, into, the, drilled, well, vertically, stacked, with, their, ends, nested, and, either, glued, or, splined, together, the, sections, of, casing, are, usually, 6, metres, 20, ft, or, more, in, length, and, 4, to, 12, in, 10, to, 30, cm, in, diameter, depending, on, the, intended, use, of, the, well, and, local, groundwater, conditions, surface, contamination, of, wells, in, the, united, states, is, typically, controlled, by, the, use, of, a, surface, seal, a, large, hole, is, drilled, to, a, predetermined, depth, or, to, a, confining, formation, clay, or, bedrock, for, example, and, then, a, smaller, hole, for, the, well, is, completed, from, that, point, forward, the, well, is, typically, cased, from, the, surface, down, into, the, smaller, hole, with, a, casing, that, is, the, same, diameter, as, that, hole, the, annular, space, between, the, large, bore, hole, and, the, smaller, casing, is, filled, with, bentonite, clay, concrete, or, other, sealant, material, this, creates, an, impermeable, seal, from, the, surface, to, the, next, confining, layer, that, keeps, contaminants, from, traveling, down, the, outer, sidewalls, of, the, casing, or, borehole, and, into, the, aquifer, in, addition, wells, are, typically, capped, with, either, an, engineered, well, cap, or, seal, that, vents, air, through, a, screen, into, the, well, but, keeps, insects, small, animals, and, unauthorized, persons, from, accessing, the, well, at, the, bottom, of, wells, based, on, formation, a, screening, device, filter, pack, slotted, casing, or, open, bore, hole, is, left, to, allow, the, flow, of, water, into, the, well, constructed, screens, are, typically, used, in, unconsolidated, formations, sands, gravels, etc, allowing, water, and, a, percentage, of, the, formation, to, pass, through, the, screen, allowing, some, material, to, pass, through, creates, a, large, area, filter, out, of, the, rest, of, the, formation, as, the, amount, of, material, present, to, pass, into, the, well, slowly, decreases, and, is, removed, from, the, well, rock, wells, are, typically, cased, with, a, pvc, liner, casing, and, screen, or, slotted, casing, at, the, bottom, this, is, mostly, present, just, to, keep, rocks, from, entering, the, pump, assembly, some, wells, utilize, a, filter, pack, method, where, an, undersized, screen, or, slotted, casing, is, placed, inside, the, well, and, a, filter, medium, is, packed, around, the, screen, between, the, screen, and, the, borehole, or, casing, this, allows, the, water, to, be, filtered, of, unwanted, materials, before, entering, the, well, and, pumping, zone, there, are, two, broad, classes, of, drilled, well, types, based, on, the, type, of, aquifer, the, well, is, in, a, special, type, of, water, well, may, be, constructed, adjacent, to, freshwater, lakes, or, streams, commonly, called, a, collector, well, but, sometimes, referred, to, by, the, trade, name, ranney, well, or, ranney, collector, this, type, of, well, involves, sinking, a, caisson, vertically, below, the, top, of, the, aquifer, and, then, advancing, lateral, collectors, out, of, the, caisson, and, beneath, the, surface, water, body, pumping, from, within, the, caisson, induces, infiltration, of, water, from, the, surface, water, body, into, the, aquifer, where, it, is, collected, by, the, collector, well, laterals, and, conveyed, into, the, caisson, where, it, can, be, pumped, to, the, ground, surface, two, additional, broad, classes, of, well, types, may, be, distinguished, based, on, the, use, of, the, well, a, water, well, constructed, for, pumping, groundwater, can, be, used, passively, as, a, monitoring, well, and, a, small, diameter, well, can, be, pumped, but, this, distinction, by, use, is, common, before, excavation, information, about, the, geology, water, table, depth, seasonal, fluctuations, recharge, area, and, rate, should, be, found, if, possible, this, work, can, be, done, by, a, hydrogeologist, or, a, groundwater, surveyor, using, a, variety, of, tools, including, electro, seismic, surveying, any, available, information, from, nearby, wells, geologic, maps, and, sometimes, geophysical, imaging, these, professionals, provide, advice, that, is, almost, as, accurate, a, driller, who, has, experience, and, knowledge, of, nearby, wells, bores, and, the, most, suitable, drilling, technique, based, on, the, expected, target, depth, shallow, pumping, wells, can, often, supply, drinking, water, at, a, very, low, cost, however, impurities, from, the, surface, easily, reach, shallow, sources, which, leads, to, a, greater, risk, of, contamination, for, these, wells, compared, to, deeper, wells, contaminated, wells, can, lead, to, the, spread, of, various, waterborne, diseases, dug, and, driven, wells, are, relatively, easy, to, contaminate, for, instance, most, dug, wells, are, unreliable, in, the, majority, of, the, united, states, some, research, has, found, that, in, cold, regions, changes, in, river, flow, and, flooding, caused, by, extreme, rainfall, or, snowmelt, can, degrade, well, water, quality, most, of, the, bacteria, viruses, parasites, and, fungi, that, contaminate, well, water, comes, from, fecal, material, from, humans, and, other, animals, common, bacterial, contaminants, include, e, coli, salmonella, shigella, and, campylobacter, jejuni, common, viral, contaminants, include, norovirus, sapovirus, rotavirus, enteroviruses, and, hepatitis, a, and, e, parasites, include, giardia, lamblia, cryptosporidium, cyclospora, cayetanensis, and, microsporidia, chemical, contamination, is, a, common, problem, with, groundwater, nitrates, from, sewage, sewage, sludge, or, fertilizer, are, a, particular, problem, for, babies, and, young, children, pollutant, chemicals, include, pesticides, and, volatile, organic, compounds, from, gasoline, dry, cleaning, the, fuel, additive, methyl, tert, butyl, ether, mtbe, and, perchlorate, from, rocket, fuel, airbag, inflators, and, other, artificial, and, natural, sources, several, minerals, are, also, contaminants, including, lead, leached, from, brass, fittings, or, old, lead, pipes, chromium, vi, from, electroplating, and, other, sources, naturally, occurring, arsenic, radon, and, uranium, all, of, which, can, cause, cancer, and, naturally, occurring, fluoride, which, is, desirable, in, low, quantities, to, prevent, tooth, decay, but, can, cause, dental, fluorosis, in, higher, concentrations, some, chemicals, are, commonly, present, in, water, wells, at, levels, that, are, not, toxic, but, can, cause, other, problems, calcium, and, magnesium, cause, what, is, known, as, hard, water, which, can, precipitate, and, clog, pipes, or, burn, out, water, heaters, iron, and, manganese, can, appear, as, dark, flecks, that, stain, clothing, and, plumbing, and, can, promote, the, growth, of, iron, and, manganese, bacteria, that, can, form, slimy, black, colonies, that, clog, pipes, the, quality, of, the, well, water, can, be, significantly, increased, by, lining, the, well, sealing, the, well, head, fitting, a, self, priming, hand, pump, constructing, an, apron, ensuring, the, area, is, kept, clean, and, free, from, stagnant, water, and, animals, moving, sources, of, contamination, pit, latrines, garbage, pits, on, site, sewer, systems, and, carrying, out, hygiene, education, the, well, should, be, cleaned, with, 1, chlorine, solution, after, construction, and, periodically, every, 6, months, well, holes, should, be, covered, to, prevent, loose, debris, animals, animal, excrement, and, wind, blown, foreign, matter, from, falling, into, the, hole, and, decomposing, the, cover, should, be, able, to, be, in, place, at, all, times, including, when, drawing, water, from, the, well, a, suspended, roof, over, an, open, hole, helps, to, some, degree, but, ideally, the, cover, should, be, tight, fitting, and, fully, enclosing, with, only, a, screened, air, vent, minimum, distances, and, soil, percolation, requirements, between, sewage, disposal, sites, and, water, wells, need, to, be, observed, rules, regarding, the, design, and, installation, of, private, and, municipal, septic, systems, take, all, these, factors, into, account, so, that, nearby, drinking, water, sources, are, protected, education, of, the, general, population, in, society, also, plays, an, important, role, in, protecting, drinking, water, cleanup, of, contaminated, groundwater, tends, to, be, very, costly, effective, remediation, of, groundwater, is, generally, very, difficult, contamination, of, groundwater, from, surface, and, subsurface, sources, can, usually, be, dramatically, reduced, by, correctly, centering, the, casing, during, construction, and, filling, the, casing, annulus, with, an, appropriate, sealing, material, the, sealing, material, grout, should, be, placed, from, immediately, above, the, production, zone, back, to, surface, because, in, the, absence, of, a, correctly, constructed, casing, seal, contaminated, fluid, can, travel, into, the, well, through, the, casing, annulus, centering, devices, are, important, usually, one, per, length, of, casing, or, at, maximum, intervals, of, 9, m, to, ensure, that, the, grouted, annular, space, is, of, even, thickness, upon, the, construction, of, a, new, test, well, it, is, considered, best, practice, to, invest, in, a, complete, battery, of, chemical, and, biological, tests, on, the, well, water, in, question, point, of, use, treatment, is, available, for, individual, properties, and, treatment, plants, are, often, constructed, for, municipal, water, supplies, that, suffer, from, contamination, most, of, these, treatment, methods, involve, the, filtration, of, the, contaminants, of, concern, and, additional, protection, may, be, garnered, by, installing, well, casing, screens, only, at, depths, where, contamination, is, not, present, wellwater, for, personal, use, is, often, filtered, with, reverse, osmosis, water, processors, this, process, can, remove, very, small, particles, a, simple, effective, way, of, killing, microorganisms, is, to, bring, the, water, to, a, full, boil, for, one, to, three, minutes, depending, on, location, a, household, well, contaminated, by, microorganisms, can, initially, be, treated, by, shock, chlorination, using, bleach, generating, concentrations, hundreds, of, times, greater, than, found, in, community, water, systems, however, this, will, not, fix, any, structural, problems, that, led, to, the, contamination, and, generally, requires, some, expertise, and, testing, for, effective, application, after, the, filtration, process, it, is, common, to, implement, an, ultraviolet, uv, system, to, kill, pathogens, in, the, water, uv, light, affects, the, dna, of, the, pathogen, by, uv, c, photons, breaking, through, the, cell, wall, uv, disinfection, has, been, gaining, popularity, in, the, past, decades, as, it, is, a, chemical, free, method, of, water, treatment, a, risk, with, the, placement, of, water, wells, is, soil, salination, which, occurs, when, the, water, table, of, the, soil, begins, to, drop, and, salt, begins, to, accumulate, as, the, soil, begins, to, dry, out, another, environmental, problem, that, is, very, prevalent, in, water, well, drilling, is, the, potential, for, methane, to, seep, through, the, potential, for, soil, salination, is, a, large, risk, when, choosing, the, placement, of, water, wells, soil, salination, is, caused, when, the, water, table, of, the, soil, drops, over, time, and, salt, begins, to, accumulate, in, turn, the, increased, amount, of, salt, begins, to, dry, the, soil, out, the, increased, level, of, salt, in, the, soil, can, result, in, the, degradation, of, soil, and, can, be, very, harmful, to, vegetation, methane, an, asphyxiant, is, a, chemical, compound, that, is, the, main, component, of, natural, gas, when, methane, is, introduced, into, a, confined, space, it, displaces, oxygen, reducing, oxygen, concentration, to, a, level, low, enough, to, pose, a, threat, to, humans, and, other, aerobic, organisms, but, still, high, enough, for, a, risk, of, spontaneous, or, externally, caused, explosion, this, potential, for, explosion, is, what, poses, such, a, danger, in, regards, to, the, drilling, and, placement, of, water, wells, low, levels, of, methane, in, drinking, water, are, not, considered, toxic, when, methane, seeps, into, a, water, supply, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, methane, migration, this, can, be, caused, by, old, natural, gas, wells, near, water, well, systems, becoming, abandoned, and, no, longer, monitored, lately, however, the, described, wells, pumps, are, no, longer, very, efficient, and, can, be, replaced, by, either, handpumps, or, treadle, pumps, another, alternative, is, the, use, of, self, dug, wells, electrical, deep, well, pumps, for, higher, depths, appropriate, technology, organizations, as, practical, action, are, now, supplying, information, on, how, to, build, set, up, diy, handpumps, and, treadle, pumps, in, practice, per, and, polyfluoroalkyl, substances, pfas, or, pfass, are, a, group, of, synthetic, organofluorine, chemical, compounds, that, have, multiple, fluorine, atoms, attached, to, an, alkyl, chain, pfas, are, a, group, of, forever, chemicals, that, spread, very, quickly, and, very, far, in, ground, water, polluting, it, permanently, water, wells, near, certain, airports, where, any, form, fire, fighting, or, training, activities, occurred, up, to, 2010, are, likely, to, be, contaminated, by, pfas, a, study, concluded, that, of, 39, million, groundwater, wells, 6, 20, are, at, high, risk, of, running, dry, if, local, groundwater, levels, decline, by, less, than, five, meters, or, as, with, many, areas, and, possibly, more, than, half, of, major, aquifers, continue, to, decline, springs, and, wells, have, had, cultural, significance, since, prehistoric, times, leading, to, the, foundation, of, towns, such, as, wells, and, bath, in, somerset, interest, in, health, benefits, led, to, the, growth, of, spa, towns, including, many, with, wells, in, their, name, examples, being, llandrindod, wells, and, royal, tunbridge, wells, eratosthenes, is, sometimes, claimed, to, have, used, a, well, in, his, calculation, of, the, earth, s, circumference, however, this, is, just, a, simplification, used, in, a, shorter, explanation, of, cleomedes, since, eratosthenes, had, used, a, more, elaborate, and, precise, method, many, incidents, in, the, bible, take, place, around, wells, such, as, the, finding, of, a, wife, for, isaac, in, genesis, and, jesus, s, talk, with, the, samaritan, woman, in, the, gospels, for, a, well, with, impermeable, walls, the, water, in, the, well, is, resupplied, from, the, bottom, of, the, well, the, rate, at, which, water, flows, into, the, well, will, depend, on, the, pressure, difference, between, the, ground, water, at, the, well, bottom, and, the, well, water, at, the, well, bottom, the, pressure, of, a, column, of, water, of, height, z, will, be, equal, to, the, weight, of, the, water, in, the, column, divided, by, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, column, so, the, pressure, of, the, ground, water, a, distance, z, t, below, the, top, of, the, water, table, will, be, where, is, the, mass, density, of, the, water, and, g, is, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, when, the, water, in, the, well, is, below, the, water, table, level, the, pressure, at, the, bottom, of, the, well, due, to, the, water, in, the, well, will, be, less, than, p, g, and, water, will, be, forced, into, the, well, referring, to, the, diagram, if, z, is, the, distance, from, the, bottom, of, the, well, to, the, well, water, level, and, z, t, is, the, distance, from, the, bottom, of, the, well, to, the, top, of, the, water, table, the, pressure, difference, will, be, applying, darcy, s, law, the, volume, rate, f, at, which, water, is, forced, into, the, well, will, be, proportional, to, this, pressure, difference, where, r, is, the, resistance, to, the, flow, which, depends, on, the, well, cross, section, the, pressure, gradient, at, the, bottom, of, the, well, and, the, characteristics, of, the, substrate, at, the, well, bottom, e, g, porosity, the, volume, flow, rate, into, the, well, can, be, written, as, a, function, of, the, rate, of, change, of, the, well, water, level, combining, the, above, three, equations, yields, a, simple, differential, equation, in, z, which, may, be, solved, where, z, 0, is, the, well, water, level, at, time, t, 0, and, is, the, well, time, constant, note, that, if, dz, dt, for, a, depleted, well, can, be, measured, it, will, be, equal, to, z, t, displaystyle, z, t, tau, and, the, time, constant, can, be, calculated, according, to, the, above, model, it, will, take, an, infinite, amount, of, time, for, a, well, to, fully, recover, but, if, we, consider, a, well, that, is, 99, recovered, to, be, practically, recovered, the, time, for, a, well, to, practically, recover, from, a, level, at, z, will, be, for, a, well, that, is, fully, depleted, z, 0, it, would, take, a, time, of, about, 4, 6, to, practically, recover, the, above, model, does, not, take, into, account, the, depletion, of, the, aquifer, due, to, the, pumping, which, lowered, the, well, water, level, see, aquifer, test, and, groundwater, flow, equation, also, practical, wells, may, have, impermeable, walls, only, up, to, but, not, including, the, bedrock, which, will, give, a, larger, surface, area, for, water, to, enter, the, well
