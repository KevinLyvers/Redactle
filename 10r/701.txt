aviation, includes, the, activities, surrounding, mechanical, flight, and, the, aircraft, industry, aircraft, includes, fixed, wing, and, rotary, wing, types, morphable, wings, wing, less, lifting, bodies, as, well, as, lighter, than, air, craft, such, as, hot, air, balloons, and, airships, aviation, began, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, development, of, the, hot, air, balloon, an, apparatus, capable, of, atmospheric, displacement, through, buoyancy, some, of, the, most, significant, advancements, in, aviation, technology, came, with, the, controlled, gliding, flying, of, otto, lilienthal, in, 1896, then, a, large, step, in, significance, came, with, the, construction, of, the, first, powered, airplane, by, the, wright, brothers, in, the, early, 1900s, since, that, time, aviation, has, been, technologically, revolutionized, by, the, introduction, of, the, jet, which, permitted, a, major, form, of, transport, throughout, the, world, the, word, aviation, was, coined, by, the, french, writer, and, former, naval, officer, gabriel, la, landelle, in, 1863, he, originally, derived, the, term, from, the, verb, avier, an, unsuccessful, neologism, for, to, fly, itself, derived, from, the, latin, word, avis, bird, and, the, suffix, ation, there, are, early, legends, of, human, flight, such, as, the, stories, of, icarus, in, greek, myth, jamshid, and, shah, kay, k, vus, in, persian, myth, and, the, flying, automaton, of, archytas, of, tarentum, 428, 347, bc, later, somewhat, more, credible, claims, of, short, distance, human, flights, appear, such, as, the, winged, flights, of, abbas, ibn, firnas, 810, 887, recorded, in, the, 17th, century, eilmer, of, malmesbury, 11th, century, recorded, in, the, 12th, century, and, the, hot, air, passarola, of, bartholomeu, louren, o, de, gusm, o, 1685, 1724, the, modern, age, of, aviation, began, with, the, first, untethered, human, lighter, than, air, flight, on, november, 21, 1783, of, a, hot, air, balloon, designed, by, the, montgolfier, brothers, the, usefulness, of, balloons, was, limited, because, they, could, only, travel, downwind, it, was, immediately, recognized, that, a, steerable, or, dirigible, balloon, was, required, jean, pierre, blanchard, flew, the, first, human, powered, dirigible, in, 1784, and, crossed, the, english, channel, in, one, in, 1785, rigid, airships, became, the, first, aircraft, to, transport, passengers, and, cargo, over, great, distances, the, best, known, aircraft, of, this, type, were, manufactured, by, the, german, zeppelin, company, the, most, successful, zeppelin, was, the, graf, zeppelin, it, flew, over, one, million, miles, including, an, around, the, world, flight, in, august, 1929, however, the, dominance, of, the, zeppelins, over, the, airplanes, of, that, period, which, had, a, range, of, only, a, few, hundred, miles, was, diminishing, as, airplane, design, advanced, the, golden, age, of, the, airships, ended, on, may, 6, 1937, that, year, the, hindenburg, caught, fire, killing, 36, people, the, cause, of, the, hindenburg, accident, was, initially, blamed, on, the, use, of, hydrogen, instead, of, helium, as, the, lift, gas, an, internal, investigation, by, the, manufacturer, revealed, that, the, coating, used, in, the, material, covering, the, frame, was, highly, flammable, and, allowed, static, electricity, to, build, up, in, the, airship, changes, to, the, coating, formulation, reduced, the, risk, of, further, hindenburg, type, accidents, although, there, have, been, periodic, initiatives, to, revive, their, use, airships, have, seen, only, niche, application, since, that, time, there, had, been, previous, airship, accidents, that, were, more, fatal, for, instance, a, british, r38, on, 23, august, 1921, but, the, hindenburg, was, the, first, to, be, captured, on, newsreel, in, 1799, sir, george, cayley, set, forth, the, concept, of, the, modern, airplane, as, a, fixed, wing, flying, machine, with, separate, systems, for, lift, propulsion, and, control, otto, lilienthal, was, the, first, person, to, make, well, documented, repeated, successful, flights, with, gliders, therefore, making, the, idea, of, heavier, than, air, a, reality, newspapers, and, magazines, published, photographs, of, lilienthal, gliding, favorably, influencing, public, and, scientific, opinion, about, the, possibility, of, flying, machines, becoming, practical, lilienthal, s, work, led, to, him, developing, the, concept, of, the, modern, wing, his, flight, attempts, in, berlin, in, 1891, are, seen, as, the, beginning, of, human, flight, and, the, lilienthal, normalsegelapparat, is, considered, to, be, the, first, airplane, in, series, production, making, the, maschinenfabrik, otto, lilienthal, in, berlin, the, first, air, plane, production, company, in, the, world, lilienthal, is, often, referred, to, as, either, the, father, of, aviation, or, father, of, flight, early, dirigible, developments, included, machine, powered, propulsion, henri, giffard, 1852, rigid, frames, david, schwarz, 1896, and, improved, speed, and, maneuverability, alberto, santos, dumont, 1901, there, are, many, competing, claims, for, the, earliest, powered, heavier, than, air, flight, the, first, recorded, powered, flight, was, carried, out, by, cl, ment, ader, on, october, 9, 1890, in, his, bat, winged, fully, self, propelled, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, ader, ole, it, was, reportedly, the, first, manned, powered, heavier, than, air, flight, of, a, significant, distance, 50, m, 160, ft, but, insignificant, altitude, from, level, ground, seven, years, later, on, october, 14, 1897, ader, s, avion, iii, was, tested, without, success, in, front, of, two, officials, from, the, french, war, ministry, the, report, on, the, trials, was, not, publicized, until, 1910, as, they, had, been, a, military, secret, in, november, 1906, ader, claimed, to, have, made, a, successful, flight, on, october, 14, 1897, achieving, an, uninterrupted, flight, of, around, 300, metres, 980, feet, although, widely, believed, at, the, time, these, claims, were, later, discredited, the, wright, brothers, made, the, first, successful, powered, controlled, and, sustained, airplane, flight, on, december, 17, 1903, a, feat, made, possible, by, their, invention, of, three, axis, control, and, in, house, development, of, an, engine, with, a, sufficient, power, to, weight, ratio, only, a, decade, later, at, the, start, of, world, war, i, heavier, than, air, powered, aircraft, had, become, practical, for, reconnaissance, artillery, spotting, and, even, attacks, against, ground, positions, aircraft, began, to, transport, people, and, cargo, as, designs, grew, larger, and, more, reliable, the, wright, brothers, took, aloft, the, first, passenger, charles, furnas, one, of, their, mechanics, on, may, 14, 1908, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, great, progress, was, made, in, the, field, of, aviation, including, the, first, transatlantic, flight, of, alcock, and, brown, in, 1919, charles, lindbergh, s, solo, transatlantic, flight, in, 1927, and, charles, kingsford, smith, s, transpacific, flight, the, following, year, one, of, the, most, successful, designs, of, this, period, was, the, douglas, dc, 3, which, became, the, first, airliner, to, be, profitable, carrying, passengers, exclusively, starting, the, modern, era, of, passenger, airline, service, by, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, many, towns, and, cities, had, built, airports, and, there, were, numerous, qualified, pilots, available, during, world, war, ii, one, of, the, first, jet, engines, was, developed, by, hans, con, ohain, and, accomplished, the, world, s, first, jet, powered, flight, in, 1939, the, war, brought, many, innovations, to, aviation, including, the, first, jet, aircraft, and, the, first, liquid, fueled, rockets, after, world, war, ii, especially, in, north, america, there, was, a, boom, in, general, aviation, both, private, and, commercial, as, thousands, of, pilots, were, released, from, military, service, and, many, inexpensive, war, surplus, transport, and, training, aircraft, became, available, manufacturers, such, as, cessna, piper, and, beechcraft, expanded, production, to, provide, light, aircraft, for, the, new, middle, class, market, by, the, 1950s, the, development, of, civil, jets, grew, beginning, with, the, de, havilland, comet, though, the, first, widely, used, passenger, jet, was, the, boeing, 707, because, it, was, much, more, economical, than, other, aircraft, at, that, time, at, the, same, time, turboprop, propulsion, started, to, appear, for, smaller, commuter, planes, making, it, possible, to, serve, small, volume, routes, in, a, much, wider, range, of, weather, conditions, since, the, 1960s, composite, material, airframes, and, quieter, more, efficient, engines, have, become, available, and, concorde, provided, supersonic, passenger, service, for, more, than, two, decades, but, the, most, important, lasting, innovations, have, taken, place, in, instrumentation, and, control, the, arrival, of, solid, state, electronics, the, global, positioning, system, satellite, communications, and, increasingly, small, and, powerful, computers, and, led, displays, have, dramatically, changed, the, cockpits, of, airliners, and, increasingly, of, smaller, aircraft, as, well, pilots, can, navigate, much, more, accurately, and, view, terrain, obstructions, and, other, nearby, aircraft, on, a, map, or, through, synthetic, vision, even, at, night, or, in, low, visibility, on, june, 21, 2004, spaceshipone, became, the, first, privately, funded, aircraft, to, make, a, spaceflight, opening, the, possibility, of, an, aviation, market, capable, of, leaving, the, earth, s, atmosphere, meanwhile, the, need, to, decarbonize, the, aviation, industry, to, face, the, climate, crisis, has, increased, research, into, aircraft, powered, by, alternative, fuels, such, as, ethanol, electricity, hydrogen, and, even, solar, energy, with, flying, prototypes, becoming, more, common, civil, aviation, includes, all, non, military, flying, both, general, aviation, and, scheduled, air, transport, there, are, five, major, manufacturers, of, civil, transport, aircraft, in, alphabetical, order, boeing, airbus, ilyushin, and, tupolev, concentrate, on, wide, body, and, narrow, body, jet, airliners, while, bombardier, embraer, and, sukhoi, concentrate, on, regional, airliners, large, networks, of, specialized, parts, suppliers, from, around, the, world, support, these, manufacturers, who, sometimes, provide, only, the, initial, design, and, final, assembly, in, their, own, plants, the, chinese, acac, consortium, has, also, recently, entered, the, civil, transport, market, with, its, comac, arj21, regional, jet, until, the, 1970s, most, major, airlines, were, flag, carriers, sponsored, by, their, governments, and, heavily, protected, from, competition, since, then, open, skies, agreements, have, resulted, in, increased, competition, and, choice, for, consumers, coupled, with, falling, prices, for, airlines, the, combination, of, high, fuel, prices, low, fares, high, salaries, and, crises, such, as, the, september, 11, attacks, and, the, sars, pandemic, have, driven, many, older, airlines, to, government, bailouts, bankruptcy, or, mergers, at, the, same, time, low, cost, carriers, such, as, ryanair, southwest, and, westjet, have, flourished, general, aviation, includes, all, non, scheduled, civil, flying, both, private, and, commercial, general, aviation, may, include, business, flights, air, charter, private, aviation, flight, training, ballooning, paragliding, parachuting, gliding, hang, gliding, aerial, photography, foot, launched, powered, hang, gliders, air, ambulance, crop, dusting, charter, flights, traffic, reporting, police, air, patrols, and, forest, fire, fighting, each, country, regulates, aviation, differently, but, general, aviation, usually, falls, under, different, regulations, depending, on, whether, it, is, private, or, commercial, and, on, the, type, of, equipment, involved, many, small, aircraft, manufacturers, serve, the, general, aviation, market, with, a, focus, on, private, aviation, and, flight, training, the, most, important, recent, developments, for, small, aircraft, which, form, the, bulk, of, the, ga, fleet, have, been, the, introduction, of, advanced, avionics, including, gps, that, were, formerly, found, only, in, large, airliners, and, the, introduction, of, composite, materials, to, make, small, aircraft, lighter, and, faster, ultralight, and, homebuilt, aircraft, have, also, become, increasingly, popular, for, recreational, use, since, in, most, countries, that, allow, private, aviation, they, are, much, less, expensive, and, less, heavily, regulated, than, certified, aircraft, simple, balloons, were, used, as, surveillance, aircraft, as, early, as, the, 18th, century, over, the, years, military, aircraft, have, been, built, to, meet, ever, increasing, capability, requirements, manufacturers, of, military, aircraft, compete, for, contracts, to, supply, their, government, s, arsenal, aircraft, are, selected, based, on, factors, like, cost, performance, and, the, speed, of, production, aviation, safety, means, the, state, of, an, aviation, system, or, organization, in, which, risks, associated, with, aviation, activities, related, to, or, in, direct, support, of, the, operation, of, aircraft, are, reduced, and, controlled, to, an, acceptable, level, it, encompasses, the, theory, practice, investigation, and, categorization, of, flight, failures, and, the, prevention, of, such, failures, through, regulation, education, and, training, it, can, also, be, applied, in, the, context, of, campaigns, that, inform, the, public, as, to, the, safety, of, air, travel, a, maintenance, repair, and, overhaul, organization, mro, is, a, firm, that, ensures, airworthiness, or, air, transport, according, to, a, 2024, article, maintenance, m, involves, inspecting, cleaning, oiling, and, changing, aircraft, parts, after, a, certain, number, of, flight, hours, repair, r, is, restoring, the, original, function, of, parts, and, components, overhaul, o, refers, to, extensive, maintenance, the, complete, refurbishment, of, the, aircraft, and, upgrades, in, avionics, which, can, take, several, weeks, to, complete, airlines, are, legally, obligated, to, certify, airworthiness, meaning, that, a, civil, aviation, authority, must, approve, an, aircraft, suitable, for, safe, flight, operations, mro, firms, are, responsible, for, this, process, thoroughly, checking, and, documenting, all, components, repairs, while, tracking, mechanical, propulsion, and, electronic, parts, aviation, regulators, oversee, maintenance, practices, in, the, country, of, aircraft, registration, manufacture, or, current, location, all, aircraft, maintenance, activities, must, adhere, to, international, regulations, that, mandate, standards, an, aviation, accident, is, defined, by, the, convention, on, international, civil, aviation, annex, 13, as, an, occurrence, associated, with, the, operation, of, an, aircraft, which, takes, place, between, the, time, any, person, boards, the, aircraft, with, the, intention, of, flight, until, such, time, as, all, such, persons, have, disembarked, in, which, a, person, is, fatally, or, seriously, injured, the, aircraft, sustains, damage, or, structural, failure, or, the, aircraft, is, missing, or, is, completely, inaccessible, an, accident, in, which, the, damage, to, the, aircraft, is, such, that, it, must, be, written, off, or, in, which, the, plane, is, destroyed, is, called, a, hull, loss, accident, the, first, fatal, aviation, accident, occurred, in, a, wright, model, a, aircraft, at, fort, myer, virginia, us, on, september, 17, 1908, resulting, in, injury, to, the, pilot, orville, wright, and, death, of, the, passenger, signal, corps, lieutenant, thomas, selfridge, the, worst, aviation, accident, in, history, was, the, tenerife, airport, disaster, on, march, 27, 1977, when, 583, people, died, when, two, boeing, 747, jumbo, jets, operated, by, pan, am, and, klm, collided, on, a, runway, in, los, rodeos, airport, now, known, as, tenerife, north, an, aviation, incident, is, defined, as, an, occurrence, other, than, an, accident, associated, with, the, operation, of, an, aircraft, that, affects, or, could, affect, the, safety, of, operations, air, traffic, control, atc, involves, communication, with, aircraft, to, help, maintain, separation, that, is, they, ensure, that, aircraft, are, sufficiently, far, enough, apart, horizontally, or, vertically, for, no, risk, of, collision, controllers, may, co, ordinate, position, reports, provided, by, pilots, or, in, high, traffic, areas, such, as, the, united, states, they, may, use, radar, to, see, aircraft, positions, becoming, an, air, traffic, controller, in, the, united, states, typically, requires, an, associate, or, bachelor, s, degree, from, the, air, traffic, collegiate, training, initiative, the, faa, also, requires, extensive, training, along, with, medical, examinations, and, background, checks, some, controllers, are, required, to, work, weekend, night, and, holiday, shifts, there, are, generally, four, different, types, of, atc, atc, is, especially, important, for, aircraft, flying, under, instrument, flight, rules, ifr, when, they, may, be, in, weather, conditions, that, do, not, allow, the, pilots, to, see, other, aircraft, however, in, very, high, traffic, areas, especially, near, major, airports, aircraft, flying, under, visual, flight, rules, vfr, are, also, required, to, follow, instructions, from, atc, in, addition, to, separation, from, other, aircraft, atc, may, provide, weather, advisories, terrain, separation, navigation, assistance, and, other, services, to, pilots, depending, on, their, workload, atc, do, not, control, all, flights, the, majority, of, vfr, visual, flight, rules, flights, in, north, america, are, not, required, to, contact, atc, unless, they, are, passing, through, a, busy, terminal, area, or, using, a, major, airport, and, in, many, areas, such, as, northern, canada, and, low, altitude, in, northern, scotland, air, traffic, control, services, are, not, available, even, for, ifr, flights, at, lower, altitudes, like, all, activities, involving, combustion, operating, powered, aircraft, from, airliners, to, hot, air, balloons, releases, soot, and, other, pollutants, into, the, atmosphere, greenhouse, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, are, also, produced, in, addition, there, are, environmental, impacts, specific, to, aviation, for, instance, another, environmental, impact, of, aviation, is, noise, pollution, mainly, caused, by, aircraft, taking, off, and,
