organic, farming, also, known, as, ecological, farming, or, biological, farming, is, an, agricultural, system, that, uses, fertilizers, of, organic, origin, such, as, compost, manure, green, manure, and, bone, meal, and, places, emphasis, on, techniques, such, as, crop, rotation, and, companion, planting, it, originated, early, in, the, 20th, century, in, reaction, to, rapidly, changing, farming, practices, certified, organic, agriculture, accounts, for, 70, million, hectares, 170, million, acres, globally, with, over, half, of, that, total, in, australia, biological, pest, control, mixed, cropping, and, the, fostering, of, insect, predators, are, encouraged, organic, standards, are, designed, to, allow, the, use, of, naturally, occurring, substances, while, prohibiting, or, strictly, limiting, synthetic, substances, for, instance, naturally, occurring, pesticides, such, as, pyrethrin, are, permitted, while, synthetic, fertilizers, and, pesticides, are, generally, prohibited, synthetic, substances, that, are, allowed, include, for, example, copper, sulfate, elemental, sulfur, and, veterinary, drugs, genetically, modified, organisms, nanomaterials, human, sewage, sludge, plant, growth, regulators, hormones, and, antibiotic, use, in, livestock, husbandry, are, prohibited, organic, farming, advocates, claim, advantages, in, sustainability, openness, self, sufficiency, autonomy, and, independence, health, food, security, and, food, safety, organic, agricultural, methods, are, internationally, regulated, and, legally, enforced, by, transnational, organizations, as, european, union, and, many, nations, based, in, large, part, on, the, standards, set, by, the, international, federation, of, organic, agriculture, movements, ifoam, an, international, umbrella, organization, for, organic, farming, organizations, established, in, 1972, organic, agriculture, can, be, defined, as, an, integrated, farming, system, that, strives, for, sustainability, the, enhancement, of, soil, fertility, and, biological, diversity, while, with, rare, exceptions, prohibiting, synthetic, pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic, fertilizers, genetically, modified, organisms, and, growth, hormones, since, 1990, the, market, for, organic, food, and, other, products, has, grown, rapidly, reaching, 63, billion, worldwide, in, 2012, 25, this, demand, has, driven, a, similar, increase, in, organically, managed, farmland, that, grew, from, 2001, to, 2011, at, a, compounding, rate, of, 8, 9, per, year, as, of, 2022, approximately, 96, 000, 000, hectares, 240, 000, 000, acres, worldwide, were, farmed, organically, representing, approximately, 2, of, total, world, farmland, organic, farming, can, be, beneficial, on, biodiversity, and, environmental, protection, at, local, level, however, because, organic, farming, has, sometimes, lower, yields, compared, to, intensive, farming, additional, agricultural, land, is, needed, elsewhere, in, the, world, which, means, that, natural, and, forest, land, has, to, be, converted, into, agricultural, land, this, can, cause, loss, of, biodiversity, and, negative, climate, effects, that, sometimes, outweigh, the, local, environmental, gains, achieved, this, lower, yields, does, not, include, dry, lands, agriculture, was, practiced, for, thousands, of, years, without, the, use, of, artificial, chemicals, artificial, fertilizers, were, first, developed, during, the, mid, 19th, century, these, early, fertilizers, were, cheap, powerful, and, easy, to, transport, in, bulk, similar, advances, occurred, in, chemical, pesticides, in, the, 1940s, leading, to, the, decade, being, referred, to, as, the, pesticide, era, these, new, agricultural, techniques, while, beneficial, in, the, short, term, had, serious, longer, term, side, effects, such, as, soil, compaction, erosion, and, declines, in, overall, soil, fertility, along, with, health, concerns, about, toxic, chemicals, entering, the, food, supply, 10, in, the, late, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, soil, biology, scientists, began, to, seek, ways, to, remedy, these, side, effects, while, still, maintaining, higher, production, in, 1921, the, founder, and, pioneer, of, the, organic, movement, albert, howard, and, his, wife, gabrielle, howard, accomplished, botanists, founded, an, institute, of, plant, industry, to, improve, traditional, farming, methods, in, india, among, other, things, they, brought, improved, implements, and, improved, animal, husbandry, methods, from, their, scientific, training, then, by, incorporating, aspects, of, indian, traditional, methods, developed, protocols, for, the, rotation, of, crops, erosion, prevention, techniques, and, the, systematic, use, of, composts, and, manures, stimulated, by, these, experiences, of, traditional, farming, when, albert, howard, returned, to, britain, in, the, early, 1930s, he, began, to, promulgate, a, system, of, organic, agriculture, in, 1924, rudolf, steiner, gave, a, series, of, eight, lectures, on, agriculture, with, a, focus, on, influences, of, the, moon, planets, non, physical, beings, and, elemental, forces, they, were, held, in, response, to, a, request, by, adherent, farmers, who, noticed, degraded, soil, conditions, and, a, deterioration, in, the, health, and, quality, of, crops, and, livestock, resulting, from, the, use, of, chemical, fertilizers, the, lectures, were, published, in, november, 1924, the, first, english, translation, appeared, in, 1928, as, the, agriculture, course, in, july, 1939, ehrenfried, pfeiffer, the, author, of, the, standard, work, on, biodynamic, agriculture, bio, dynamic, farming, and, gardening, came, to, the, uk, at, the, invitation, of, walter, james, 4th, baron, northbourne, as, a, presenter, at, the, betteshanger, summer, school, and, conference, on, biodynamic, farming, at, northbourne, s, farm, in, kent, one, of, the, chief, purposes, of, the, conference, was, to, bring, together, the, proponents, of, various, approaches, to, organic, agriculture, in, order, that, they, might, cooperate, within, a, larger, movement, howard, attended, the, conference, where, he, met, pfeiffer, in, the, following, year, northbourne, published, his, manifesto, of, organic, farming, look, to, the, land, in, which, he, coined, the, term, organic, farming, the, betteshanger, conference, has, been, described, as, the, missing, link, between, biodynamic, agriculture, and, other, forms, of, organic, farming, in, 1940, howard, published, his, an, agricultural, testament, in, this, book, he, adopted, northbourne, s, terminology, of, organic, farming, howard, s, work, spread, widely, and, he, became, known, as, the, father, of, organic, farming, for, his, work, in, applying, scientific, knowledge, and, principles, to, various, traditional, and, natural, methods, 45, in, the, united, states, j, i, rodale, who, was, keenly, interested, both, in, howard, s, ideas, and, in, biodynamics, founded, in, the, 1940s, both, a, working, organic, farm, for, trials, and, experimentation, the, rodale, institute, and, rodale, inc, in, emmaus, pennsylvania, to, teach, and, advocate, organic, methods, to, the, wider, public, these, became, important, influences, on, the, spread, of, organic, agriculture, further, work, was, done, by, lady, eve, balfour, the, haughley, experiment, in, the, united, kingdom, and, many, others, across, the, world, the, term, eco, agriculture, was, coined, in, 1970, by, charles, walters, founder, of, acres, magazine, to, describe, agriculture, which, does, not, use, man, made, molecules, of, toxic, rescue, chemistry, effectively, another, name, for, organic, agriculture, increasing, environmental, awareness, in, the, general, population, in, modern, times, has, transformed, the, originally, supply, driven, organic, movement, to, a, demand, driven, one, premium, prices, and, some, government, subsidies, attracted, farmers, in, the, developing, world, many, producers, farm, according, to, traditional, methods, that, are, comparable, to, organic, farming, but, not, certified, and, that, may, not, include, the, latest, scientific, advancements, in, organic, agriculture, in, other, cases, farmers, in, the, developing, world, have, converted, to, modern, organic, methods, for, economic, reasons, the, use, of, organic, popularized, by, howard, and, rodale, refers, more, narrowly, to, the, use, of, organic, matter, derived, from, plant, compost, and, animal, manures, to, improve, the, humus, content, of, soils, grounded, in, the, work, of, early, soil, scientists, who, developed, what, was, then, called, humus, farming, since, the, early, 1940s, the, two, camps, have, tended, to, merge, biodynamic, agriculturists, on, the, other, hand, used, the, term, organic, to, indicate, that, a, farm, should, be, viewed, as, a, living, organism, 17, 19, in, the, sense, of, the, following, quotation, an, organic, farm, properly, speaking, is, not, one, that, uses, certain, methods, and, substances, and, avoids, others, it, is, a, farm, whose, structure, is, formed, in, imitation, of, the, structure, of, a, natural, system, that, has, the, integrity, the, independence, and, the, benign, dependence, of, an, organism, they, based, their, work, on, steiner, s, spiritually, oriented, alternative, agriculture, which, includes, various, esoteric, concepts, organic, agriculture, is, a, production, system, that, sustains, the, health, of, soils, ecosystems, and, people, it, relies, on, ecological, processes, biodiversity, and, cycles, adapted, to, local, conditions, rather, than, the, use, of, inputs, with, adverse, effects, organic, agriculture, combines, tradition, innovation, and, science, to, benefit, the, shared, environment, and, promote, fair, relationships, and, a, good, quality, of, life, for, all, involved, organic, farming, methods, combine, scientific, knowledge, of, ecology, and, some, modern, technology, with, traditional, farming, practices, based, on, naturally, occurring, biological, processes, organic, farming, methods, are, studied, in, the, field, of, agroecology, while, conventional, agriculture, uses, synthetic, pesticides, and, water, soluble, synthetically, purified, fertilizers, organic, farmers, are, restricted, by, regulations, to, using, natural, pesticides, and, fertilizers, an, example, of, a, natural, pesticide, is, pyrethrin, which, is, found, naturally, in, the, chrysanthemum, flower, the, principal, methods, of, organic, farming, include, crop, rotation, green, manures, and, compost, biological, pest, control, and, mechanical, cultivation, these, measures, use, the, natural, environment, to, enhance, agricultural, productivity, legumes, are, planted, to, fix, nitrogen, into, the, soil, natural, insect, predators, are, encouraged, crops, are, rotated, to, confuse, pests, and, renew, soil, and, natural, materials, such, as, potassium, bicarbonate, and, mulches, are, used, to, control, disease, and, weeds, genetically, modified, seeds, and, animals, are, excluded, while, organic, is, fundamentally, different, from, conventional, because, of, the, use, of, carbon, based, fertilizers, compared, with, highly, soluble, synthetic, based, fertilizers, and, biological, pest, control, instead, of, synthetic, pesticides, organic, farming, and, large, scale, conventional, farming, are, not, entirely, mutually, exclusive, many, of, the, methods, developed, for, organic, agriculture, have, been, borrowed, by, more, conventional, agriculture, for, example, integrated, pest, management, is, a, multifaceted, strategy, that, uses, various, organic, methods, of, pest, control, whenever, possible, but, in, conventional, farming, could, include, synthetic, pesticides, only, as, a, last, resort, examples, of, beneficial, insects, that, are, used, in, organic, farming, include, ladybugs, and, lacewings, both, of, which, feed, on, aphids, the, use, of, ipm, lowers, the, possibility, of, pest, developing, resistance, to, pesticides, that, are, applied, to, crops, organic, farming, encourages, crop, diversity, by, promoting, polyculture, multiple, crops, in, the, same, space, planting, a, variety, of, vegetable, crops, supports, a, wider, range, of, beneficial, insects, soil, microorganisms, and, other, factors, that, add, up, to, overall, farm, health, crop, diversity, helps, the, environment, to, thrive, and, protects, species, from, going, extinct, the, science, of, agroecology, has, revealed, the, benefits, of, polyculture, which, is, often, employed, in, organic, farming, agroecology, is, a, scientific, discipline, that, uses, ecological, theory, to, study, design, manage, and, evaluate, agricultural, systems, that, are, productive, and, resource, conserving, and, that, are, also, culturally, sensitive, socially, just, and, economically, viable, incorporating, crop, diversity, into, organic, farming, practices, can, have, several, benefits, for, instance, it, can, help, to, increase, soil, fertility, by, promoting, the, growth, of, beneficial, soil, microorganisms, it, can, also, help, to, reduce, pest, and, disease, pressure, by, creating, a, more, diverse, and, resilient, agroecosystem, furthermore, crop, diversity, can, help, to, improve, the, nutritional, quality, of, food, by, providing, a, wider, range, of, essential, nutrients, organic, farming, relies, more, heavily, on, the, natural, breakdown, of, organic, matter, than, the, average, conventional, farm, using, techniques, like, green, manure, and, composting, to, replace, nutrients, taken, from, the, soil, by, previous, crops, this, biological, process, driven, by, microorganisms, such, as, mycorrhiza, and, earthworms, releases, nutrients, available, to, plants, throughout, the, growing, season, farmers, use, a, variety, of, methods, to, improve, soil, fertility, including, crop, rotation, cover, cropping, reduced, tillage, and, application, of, compost, by, reducing, fuel, intensive, tillage, less, soil, organic, matter, is, lost, to, the, atmosphere, this, has, an, added, benefit, of, carbon, sequestration, which, reduces, greenhouse, gases, and, helps, reverse, climate, change, reducing, tillage, may, also, improve, soil, structure, and, reduce, the, potential, for, soil, erosion, plants, need, a, large, number, of, nutrients, in, various, quantities, to, flourish, supplying, enough, nitrogen, and, particularly, synchronization, so, that, plants, get, enough, nitrogen, at, the, time, when, they, need, it, most, is, a, challenge, for, organic, farmers, crop, rotation, and, green, manure, cover, crops, help, to, provide, nitrogen, through, legumes, more, precisely, the, family, fabaceae, which, fix, nitrogen, from, the, atmosphere, through, symbiosis, with, rhizobial, bacteria, intercropping, which, is, sometimes, used, for, insect, and, disease, control, can, also, increase, soil, nutrients, but, the, competition, between, the, legume, and, the, crop, can, be, problematic, and, wider, spacing, between, crop, rows, is, required, crop, residues, can, be, ploughed, back, into, the, soil, and, different, plants, leave, different, amounts, of, nitrogen, potentially, aiding, synchronization, organic, farmers, also, use, animal, manure, certain, processed, fertilizers, such, as, seed, meal, and, various, mineral, powders, such, as, rock, phosphate, and, green, sand, a, naturally, occurring, form, of, potash, that, provides, potassium, in, some, cases, ph, may, need, to, be, amended, natural, ph, amendments, include, lime, and, sulfur, but, in, the, u, s, some, compounds, such, as, iron, sulfate, aluminum, sulfate, magnesium, sulfate, and, soluble, boron, products, are, allowed, in, organic, farming, 43, mixed, farms, with, both, livestock, and, crops, can, operate, as, ley, farms, whereby, the, land, gathers, fertility, through, growing, nitrogen, fixing, forage, grasses, such, as, white, clover, or, alfalfa, and, grows, cash, crops, or, cereals, when, fertility, is, established, farms, without, livestock, stockless, may, find, it, more, difficult, to, maintain, soil, fertility, and, may, rely, more, on, external, inputs, such, as, imported, manure, as, well, as, grain, legumes, and, green, manures, although, grain, legumes, may, fix, limited, nitrogen, because, they, are, harvested, horticultural, farms, that, grow, fruits, and, vegetables, in, protected, conditions, often, rely, even, more, on, external, inputs, manure, is, very, bulky, and, is, often, not, cost, effective, to, transport, more, than, a, short, distance, from, the, source, manure, for, organic, farms, may, become, scarce, if, a, sizable, number, of, farms, become, organically, managed, organic, weed, management, promotes, weed, suppression, rather, than, weed, elimination, by, enhancing, crop, competition, and, phytotoxic, effects, on, weeds, organic, farmers, integrate, cultural, biological, mechanical, physical, and, chemical, tactics, to, manage, weeds, without, synthetic, herbicides, organic, standards, require, rotation, of, annual, crops, meaning, that, a, single, crop, cannot, be, grown, in, the, same, location, without, a, different, intervening, crop, organic, crop, rotations, frequently, include, weed, suppressive, cover, crops, and, crops, with, dissimilar, life, cycles, to, discourage, weeds, associated, with, a, particular, crop, research, is, ongoing, to, develop, organic, methods, to, promote, the, growth, of, natural, microorganisms, that, suppress, the, growth, or, germination, of, common, weeds, other, cultural, practices, used, to, enhance, crop, competitiveness, and, reduce, weed, pressure, include, selection, of, competitive, crop, varieties, high, density, planting, tight, row, spacing, and, late, planting, into, warm, soil, to, encourage, rapid, crop, germination, mechanical, and, physical, weed, control, practices, used, on, organic, farms, can, be, broadly, grouped, as, some, naturally, sourced, chemicals, are, allowed, for, herbicidal, use, these, include, certain, formulations, of, acetic, acid, concentrated, vinegar, corn, gluten, meal, and, essential, oils, a, few, selective, bioherbicides, based, on, fungal, pathogens, have, also, been, developed, at, this, time, however, organic, herbicides, and, bioherbicides, play, a, minor, role, in, the, organic, weed, control, toolbox, weeds, can, be, controlled, by, grazing, for, example, geese, have, been, used, successfully, to, weed, a, range, of, organic, crops, including, cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and, corn, reviving, the, practice, of, keeping, cotton, patch, geese, common, in, the, southern, u, s, before, the, 1950s, similarly, some, rice, farmers, introduce, ducks, and, fish, to, wet, paddy, fields, to, eat, both, weeds, and, insects, organisms, aside, from, weeds, that, cause, problems, on, farms, include, arthropods, e, g, insects, mites, nematodes, fungi, and, bacteria, practices, include, but, are, not, limited, to, examples, of, predatory, beneficial, insects, include, minute, pirate, bugs, big, eyed, bugs, and, to, a, lesser, extent, ladybugs, which, tend, to, fly, away, all, of, which, eat, a, wide, range, of, pests, lacewings, are, also, effective, but, tend, to, fly, away, praying, mantis, tend, to, move, more, slowly, and, eat, less, heavily, parasitoid, wasps, tend, to, be, effective, for, their, selected, prey, but, like, all, small, insects, can, be, less, effective, outdoors, because, the, wind, controls, their, movement, predatory, mites, are, effective, for, controlling, other, mites, 66, 90, naturally, derived, insecticides, allowed, for, use, on, organic, farms, include, bacillus, thuringiensis, a, bacterial, toxin, pyrethrum, a, chrysanthemum, extract, spinosad, a, bacterial, metabolite, neem, a, tree, extract, and, rotenone, a, legume, root, extract, fewer, than, 10, of, organic, farmers, use, these, pesticides, regularly, a, 2003, survey, found, that, only, 5, 3, of, vegetable, growers, in, california, use, rotenone, while, 1, 7, use, pyrethrum, 26, these, pesticides, are, not, always, more, safe, or, environmentally, friendly, than, synthetic, pesticides, and, can, cause, harm, 92, the, main, criterion, for, organic, pesticides, is, that, they, are, naturally, derived, and, some, naturally, derived, substances, have, been, controversial, controversial, natural, pesticides, include, rotenone, copper, nicotine, sulfate, and, pyrethrums, rotenone, and, pyrethrum, are, particularly, controversial, because, they, work, by, attacking, the, nervous, system, like, most, conventional, insecticides, rotenone, is, extremely, toxic, to, fish, and, can, induce, symptoms, resembling, parkinson, s, disease, in, mammals, although, pyrethrum, natural, pyrethrins, is, more, effective, against, insects, when, used, with, piperonyl, butoxide, which, retards, degradation, of, the, pyrethrins, organic, standards, generally, do, not, permit, use, of, the, latter, substance, naturally, derived, fungicides, allowed, for, use, on, organic, farms, include, the, bacteria, bacillus, subtilis, and, bacillus, pumilus, and, the, fungus, trichoderma, harzianum, these, are, mainly, effective, for, diseases, affecting, roots, compost, tea, contains, a, mix, of, beneficial, microbes, which, may, attack, or, out, compete, certain, plant, pathogens, but, variability, among, formulations, and, preparation, methods, may, contribute, to, inconsistent, results, or, even, dangerous, growth, of, toxic, microbes, in, compost, teas, some, naturally, derived, pesticides, are, not, allowed, for, use, on, organic, farms, these, include, nicotine, sulfate, arsenic, and, strychnine, synthetic, pesticides, allowed, for, use, on, organic, farms, include, insecticidal, soaps, and, horticultural, oils, for, insect, management, and, bordeaux, mixture, copper, hydroxide, and, sodium, bicarbonate, for, managing, fungi, copper, sulfate, and, bordeaux, mixture, copper, sulfate, plus, lime, approved, for, organic, use, in, various, jurisdictions, can, be, more, environmentally, problematic, than, some, synthetic, fungicides, disallowed, in, organic, farming, similar, concerns, apply, to, copper, hydroxide, repeated, application, of, copper, sulfate, or, copper, hydroxide, as, a, fungicide, may, eventually, result, in, copper, accumulation, to, toxic, levels, in, soil, and, admonitions, to, avoid, excessive, accumulations, of, copper, in, soil, appear, in, various, organic, standards, and, elsewhere, environmental, concerns, for, several, kinds, of, biota, arise, at, average, rates, of, use, of, such, substances, for, some, crops, in, the, european, union, where, replacement, of, copper, based, fungicides, in, organic, agriculture, is, a, policy, priority, research, is, seeking, alternatives, for, organic, production, raising, livestock, and, poultry, for, meat, dairy, and, eggs, is, another, traditional, farming, activity, that, complements, growing, organic, farms, attempt, to, provide, animals, with, natural, living, conditions, and, feed, organic, certification, verifies, that, livestock, are, raised, according, to, the, usda, organic, regulations, throughout, their, lives, these, regulations, include, the, requirement, that, all, animal, feed, must, be, certified, organic, organic, livestock, may, be, and, must, be, treated, with, medicine, when, they, are, sick, but, drugs, cannot, be, used, to, promote, growth, their, feed, must, be, organic, and, they, must, be, pastured, 19ff, also, horses, and, cattle, were, once, a, basic, farm, feature, that, provided, labour, for, hauling, and, plowing, fertility, through, recycling, of, manure, and, fuel, in, the, form, of, food, for, farmers, and, other, animals, while, today, small, growing, operations, often, do, not, include, livestock, domesticated, animals, are, a, desirable, part, of, the, organic, farming, equation, especially, for, true, sustainability, the, ability, of, a, farm, to, function, as, a, self, renewing, unit, a, key, characteristic, of, organic, farming, is, the, exclusion, of, genetically, engineered, plants, and, animals, on, 19, october, 1998, participants, at, ifoam, s, 12th, scientific, conference, issued, the, mar, del, plata, declaration, where, more, than, 600, delegates, from, over, 60, countries, voted, unanimously, to, exclude, the, use, of, genetically, modified, organisms, in, organic, food, production, and, agriculture, although, opposition, to, the, use, of, any, transgenic, technologies, in, organic, farming, is, strong, agricultural, researchers, luis, herrera, estrella, and, ariel, alvarez, morales, continue, to, advocate, integration, of, transgenic, technologies, into, organic, farming, as, the, optimal, means, to, sustainable, agriculture, particularly, in, the, developing, world, organic, farmer, raoul, adamchak, and, geneticist, pamela, ronald, write, that, many, agricultural, applications, of, biotechnology, are, consistent, with, organic, principles, and, have, significantly, advanced, sustainable, agriculture, although, gmos, are, excluded, from, organic, farming, there, is, concern, that, the, pollen, from, genetically, modified, crops, is, increasingly, penetrating, organic, and, heirloom, seed, stocks, making, it, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, keep, these, genomes, from, entering, the, organic, food, supply, differing, regulations, among, countries, limits, the, availability, of, gmos, to, certain, countries, as, described, in, the, article, on, regulation, of, the, release, of, genetic, modified, organisms, organic, farmers, use, a, number, of, traditional, farm, tools, to, do, farming, and, may, make, use, of, agricultural, machinery, in, similar, ways, to, conventional, farming, in, the, developing, world, on, small, organic, farms, tools, are, normally, constrained, to, hand, tools, and, diesel, powered, water, pumps, standards, regulate, production, methods, and, in, some, cases, final, output, for, organic, agriculture, standards, may, be, voluntary, or, legislated, as, early, as, the, 1970s, private, associations, certified, organic, producers, in, the, 1980s, governments, began, to, produce, organic, production, guidelines, in, the, 1990s, a, trend, toward, legislated, standards, began, most, notably, with, the, 1991, eu, eco, regulation, developed, for, european, union, which, set, standards, for, 12, countries, and, a, 1993, uk, program, the, eu, s, program, was, followed, by, a, japanese, program, in, 2001, and, in, 2002, the, u, s, created, the, national, organic, program, nop, as, of, 2007, over, 60, countries, regulate, organic, farming, ifoam, 2007, 11, in, 2005, ifoam, created, the, principles, of, organic, agriculture, an, international, guideline, for, certification, criteria, typically, the, agencies, accredit, certification, groups, rather, than, individual, farms, production, materials, used, for, the, creation, of, usda, organic, certified,

of, any, fertilizer, that, contains, prohibited, materials, the, economics, of, organic, farming, a, subfield, of, agricultural, economics, encompasses, the, entire, process, and, effects, of, organic, farming, in, terms, of, human, society, including, social, costs, opportunity, costs, unintended, consequences, information, asymmetries, and, economies, of, scale, labour, input, carbon, and, methane, emissions, energy, use, eutrophication, acidification, soil, quality, effect, on, biodiversity, and, overall, land, use, vary, considerably, between, individual, farms, and, between, crops, making, general, comparisons, between, the, economics, of, organic, and, conventional, agriculture, difficult, in, the, european, union, organic, farmers, receive, more, subsidies, under, agri, environment, and, animal, welfare, subsidies, than, conventional, growers, the, markets, for, organic, products, are, strongest, in, north, america, and, europe, which, as, of, 2001, are, estimated, to, have, 6, and, 8, billion, respectively, of, the, 20, billion, global, market, 6, as, of, 2007, australasia, has, 39, of, the, total, organic, farmland, including, australia, s, 11, 800, 000,

mixed, results, these, differences, among, findings, can, often, be, attributed, to, variations, between, study, designs, including, differences, in, the, crops, studied, and, the, methodology, by, which, results, were, gathered, a, 2012, meta, analysis, found, that, productivity, is, typically, lower, for, organic, farming, than, conventional, farming, but, that, the, size, of, the, difference, depends, on, context, and, in, some, cases, may, be, very, small, while, organic, yields, can, be, lower, than, conventional, yields, another, meta, analysis, published, in, sustainable, agriculture, research, in, 2015, concluded, that, certain, organic, on, farm, practices, could, help, narrow, this, gap, timely, weed, management, and, the, application, of, manure, in, conjunction, with, legume, forages, cover, crops, were, shown, to, have, positive, results, in, increasing, organic, corn, and, soybean, productivity, another, meta, analysis, published, in, the, journal, agricultural, systems, in, 2011, analyzed, 362, datasets, and, found, that, organic, yields, were, on, average, 80, of, conventional, yields, the, author, s, found, that, there, are, relative, differences, in, this, yield, gap, based, on, crop, type, with, crops, like, soybeans, and, rice, scoring, higher, than, the, 80, average, and, crops, like, wheat, and, potato, scoring, lower, across, global, regions, asia, and, central, europe, were, found, to, have, relatively, higher, yields, and, northern, europe, relatively, lower, than, the, average, a, study, published, in, 2005, compared, conventional, cropping, organic, animal, based, cropping, and, organic, legume, based, cropping, on, a, test, farm, at, the, rodale, institute, over, 22, years, the, study, found, that, the, crop, yields, for, corn, and, soybeans, were, similar, in, the, organic, animal, organic, legume, and, conventional, farming, systems, it, also, found, that, significantly, less, fossil, energy, was, expended, to, produce, corn, in, the, rodale, institute, s, organic, animal, and, organic, legume, systems, than, in, the, conventional, production, system, there, was, little, difference, in, energy, input, between, the, different, treatments, for, producing, soybeans, in, the, organic, systems, synthetic, fertilizers, and, pesticides, were, generally, not, used, as, of, 2013, the, rodale, study, was, ongoing, and, a, thirty, year, anniversary, report, was, published, by, rodale, in, 2012, a, long, term, field, study, comparing, organic, conventional, agriculture, carried, out, over, 21, years, in, switzerland, concluded, that, crop, yields, of, the, organic, systems, averaged, over, 21, experimental, years, at, 80, of, the, conventional, ones, the, fertilizer, input, however, was, 34, 51, lower, indicating, an, efficient, production, the, organic, farming, systems, used, 20, 56, less, energy, to, produce, a, crop, unit, and, per, land, area, this, difference, was, 36, 53, in, spite, of, the, considerably, lower, pesticide, input, the, quality, of, organic, products, was, hardly, discernible, from, conventional, analytically, and, even, came, off, better, in, food, preference, trials, and, picture, creating, methods, in, the, united, states, organic, farming, has, been, shown, to, be, 2, 7, to, 3, 8, times, more, profitable, for, the, farmer, than, conventional, farming, when, prevailing, price, premiums, are, taken, into, account, globally, organic, farming, is, 22, 35, more, profitable, for, farmers, than, conventional, methods, according, to, a, 2015, meta, analysis, of, studies, conducted, across, five, continents, the, profitability, of, organic, agriculture, can, be, attributed, to, a, number, of, factors, first, organic, farmers, do, not, rely, on, synthetic, fertilizer, and, pesticide, inputs, which, can, be, costly, in, addition, organic, foods, currently, enjoy, a, price, premium, over, conventionally, produced, foods, meaning, that, organic, farmers, can, often, get, more, for, their, yield, the, price, premium, for, organic, food, is, an, important, factor, in, the, economic, viability, of, organic, farming, in, 2013, there, was, a, 100, price, premium, on, organic, vegetables, and, a, 57, price, premium, for, organic, fruits, these, percentages, are, based, on, wholesale, fruit, and, vegetable, prices, available, through, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, s, economic, research, service, price, premiums, exist, not, only, for, organic, versus, nonorganic, crops, but, may, also, vary, depending, on, the, venue, where, the, product, is, sold, farmers, markets, grocery, stores, or, wholesale, to, restaurants, for, many, producers, direct, sales, at, farmers, markets, are, most, profitable, because, the, farmer, receives, the, entire, markup, however, this, is, also, the, most, time, and, labour, intensive, approach, there, have, been, signs, of, organic, price, premiums, narrowing, in, recent, years, which, lowers, the, economic, incentive, for, farmers, to, convert, to, or, maintain, organic, production, methods, data, from, 22, years, of, experiments, at, the, rodale, institute, found, that, based, on, the, current, yields, and, production, costs, associated, with, organic, farming, in, the, united, states, a, price, premium, of, only, 10, is, required, to, achieve, parity, with, conventional, farming, a, separate, study, found, that, on, a, global, scale, price, premiums, of, only, 5, 7, were, needed, to, break, even, with, conventional, methods, without, the, price, premium, profitability, for, farmers, is, mixed, 11, for, markets, and, supermarkets, organic, food, is, profitable, as, well, and, is, generally, sold, at, significantly, higher, prices, than, non, organic, food, compared, to, conventional, agriculture, the, energy, efficiency, of, organic, farming, depends, upon, crop, type, and, farm, size, two, studies, both, comparing, organically, versus, conventionally, farmed, apples, declare, contradicting, results, one, saying, organic, farming, is, more, energy, efficient, the, other, saying, conventionally, is, more, efficient, it, has, generally, been, found, that, the, labor, input, per, unit, of, yield, was, higher, for, organic, systems, compared, with, conventional, production, most, sales, are, concentrated, in, developed, nations, in, 2008, 69, of, americans, claimed, to, occasionally, buy, organic, products, down, from, 73, in, 2005, one, theory, for, this, change, was, that, consumers, were, substituting, local, produce, for, organic, produce, the, usda, requires, that, distributors, manufacturers, and, processors, of, organic, products, be, certified, by, an, accredited, state, or, private, agency, in, 2007, there, were, 3, 225, certified, organic, handlers, up, from, 2, 790, in, 2004, organic, handlers, are, often, small, firms, 48, reported, sales, below, 1, million, annually, and, 22, between, 1, and, 5, million, per, year, smaller, handlers, are, more, likely, to, sell, to, independent, natural, grocery, stores, and, natural, product, chains, whereas, large, distributors, more, often, market, to, natural, product, chains, and, conventional, supermarkets, with, a, small, group, marketing, to, independent, natural, product, stores, some, handlers, work, with, conventional, farmers, to, convert, their, land, to, organic, with, the, knowledge, that, the, farmer, will, have, a, secure, sales, outlet, this, lowers, the, risk, for, the, handler, as, well, as, the, farmer, in, 2004, 31, of, handlers, provided, technical, support, on, organic, standards, or, production, to, their, suppliers, and, 34, encouraged, their, suppliers, to, transition, to, organic, smaller, farms, often, join, in, cooperatives, to, market, their, goods, more, effectively, 93, of, organic, sales, are, through, conventional, and, natural, food, supermarkets, and, chains, while, the, remaining, 7, of, u, s, organic, food, sales, occur, through, farmers, markets, foodservices, and, other, marketing, channels, in, the, 2012, census, direct, to, consumer, sales, equalled, 1, 3, billion, up, from, 812, million, in, 2002, an, increase, of, 60, percent, the, number, of, farms, that, utilize, direct, to, consumer, sales, was, 144, 530, in, 2012, in, comparison, to, 116, 733, in, 2002, direct, to, consumer, sales, include, farmers, markets, community, supported, agriculture, csa, on, farm, stores, and, roadside, farm, stands, some, organic, farms, also, sell, products, direct, to, retailer, direct, to, restaurant, and, direct, to, institution, according, to, the, 2008, organic, production, survey, approximately, 7, of, organic, farm, sales, were, direct, to, consumers, 10, went, direct, to, retailers, and, approximately, 83, went, into, wholesale, markets, in, comparison, only, 0, 4, of, the, value, of, convention, agricultural, commodities, were, direct, to, consumers, while, not, all, products, sold, at, farmer, s, markets, are, certified, organic, this, direct, to, consumer, avenue, has, become, increasingly, popular, in, local, food, distribution, and, has, grown, substantially, since, 1994, in, 2014, there, were, 8, 284, farmer, s, markets, in, comparison, to, 3, 706, in, 2004, and, 1, 755, in, 1994, most, of, which, are, found, in, populated, areas, such, as, the, northeast, midwest, and, west, coast, organic, production, is, more, labour, intensive, than, conventional, production, increased, labor, cost, is, one, factor, that, contributes, to, organic, food, being, more, expensive, organic, farming, s, increased, labor, requirements, can, be, seen, in, a, good, way, providing, more, job, opportunities, for, people, the, 2011, unep, green, economy, report, suggests, that, n, increase, in, investment, in, green, agriculture, is, projected, to, lead, to, growth, in, employment, of, about, 60, per, cent, compared, with, current, levels, and, that, green, agriculture, investments, could, create, 47, million, additional, jobs, compared, with, bau2, over, the, next, 40, years, much, of, the, growth, in, women, labour, participation, in, agriculture, is, outside, the, male, dominated, field, of, conventional, agriculture, organic, farming, has, a, greater, percentage, of, women, working, in, the, farms, with, 21, compared, to, farming, in, general, with, 14, in, 2007, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, said, that, organic, agriculture, often, leads, to, higher, prices, and, hence, a, better, income, for, farmers, so, it, should, be, promoted, however, fao, stressed, that, organic, farming, could, not, feed, the, current, human, population, much, less, the, larger, future, population, both, data, and, models, showed, that, organic, farming, was, far, from, sufficient, therefore, chemical, fertilizers, were, needed, to, avoid, hunger, others, have, argued, that, organic, farming, is, particularly, well, suited, to, food, insecure, areas, and, therefore, could, be, an, important, part, of, increased, food, security, in, places, like, sub, saharan, africa, fao, stressed, that, fertilizers, and, other, chemical, inputs, can, increase, production, particularly, in, africa, where, fertilizers, are, currently, used, 90, less, than, in, asia, for, example, in, malawi, the, yield, has, been, boosted, using, seeds, and, fertilizers, also, nepad, a, development, organization, of, african, governments, announced, that, feeding, africans, and, preventing, malnutrition, requires, fertilizers, and, enhanced, seeds, according, to, a, 2012, study, from, mcgill, university, organic, best, management, practices, show, an, average, yield, only, 13, less, than, conventional, in, the, world, s, poorer, nations, where, most, of, the, world, s, hungry, live, and, where, conventional, agriculture, s, expensive, inputs, are, not, affordable, for, the, majority, of, farmers, adopting, organic, management, actually, increases, yields, 93, on, average, and, could, be, an, important, part, of, increased, food, security, organic, agriculture, can, contribute, to, ecological, sustainability, especially, in, poorer, countries, the, application, of, organic, principles, enables, employment, of, local, resources, e, g, local, seed, varieties, manure, etc, and, therefore, cost, effectiveness, local, and, international, markets, for, organic, products, show, tremendous, growth, prospects, and, offer, creative, producers, and, exporters, excellent, opportunities, to, improve, their, income, and, living, conditions, organic, agriculture, is, knowledge, intensive, globally, capacity, building, efforts, are, underway, including, localized, training, material, to, limited, effect, as, of, 2007, the, international, federation, of, organic, agriculture, movements, hosted, more, than, 170, free, manuals, and, 75, training, opportunities, online, in, 2008, the, united, nations, environmental, programme, unep, and, the, united, nations, conference, on, trade, and, development, unctad, stated, that, organic, agriculture, can, be, more, conducive, to, food, security, in, africa, than, most, conventional, production, systems, and, that, it, is, more, likely, to, be, sustainable, in, the, long, term, and, that, yields, had, more, than, doubled, where, organic, or, near, organic, practices, had, been, used, and, that, soil, fertility, and, drought, resistance, improved, the, value, of, organic, agriculture, oa, in, the, achievement, of, the, millennium, development, goals, mdg, particularly, in, poverty, reduction, efforts, in, the, face, of, climate, change, is, shown, by, its, contribution, to, both, income, and, non, income, aspects, of, the, mdgs, these, benefits, are, expected, to, continue, in, the, post, mdg, era, a, series, of, case, studies, conducted, in, selected, areas, in, asian, countries, by, the, asian, development, bank, institute, adbi, and, published, as, a, book, compilation, by, adb, in, manila, document, these, contributions, to, both, income, and, non, income, aspects, of, the, mdgs, these, include, poverty, alleviation, by, way, of, higher, incomes, improved, farmers, health, owing, to, less, chemical, exposure, integration, of, sustainable, principles, into, rural, development, policies, improvement, of, access, to, safe, water, and, sanitation, and, expansion, of, global, partnership, for, development, as, small, farmers, are, integrated, in, value, chains, a, related, adbi, study, also, sheds, on, the, costs, of, oa, programs, and, set, them, in, the, context, of, the, costs, of, attaining, the, mdgs, the, results, show, considerable, variation, across, the, case, studies, suggesting, that, there, is, no, clear, structure, to, the, costs, of, adopting, oa, costs, depend, on, the, efficiency, of, the, oa, adoption, programs, the, lowest, cost, programs, were, more, than, ten, times, less, expensive, than, the, highest, cost, ones, however, further, analysis, of, the, gains, resulting, from, oa, adoption, reveals, that, the, costs, per, person, taken, out, of, poverty, was, much, lower, than, the, estimates, of, the, world, bank, based, on, income, growth, in, general, or, based, on, the, detailed, costs, of, meeting, some, of, the, more, quantifiable, mdgs, e, g, education, health, and, environment, agriculture, imposes, negative, externalities, upon, society, through, public, land, and, other, public, resource, use, biodiversity, loss, erosion, pesticides, nutrient, pollution, subsidized, water, usage, subsidy, payments, and, assorted, other, problems, positive, externalities, include, self, reliance, entrepreneurship, respect, for, nature, and, air, quality, organic, methods, differ, from, conventional, methods, in, the, impacts, of, their, respective, externalities, dependent, on, implementation, and, crop, type, overall, land, use, is, generally, higher, for, organic, methods, but, organic, methods, generally, use, less, energy, in, production, the, analysis, and, comparison, of, externalities, is, complicated, by, whether, the, comparison, is, done, using, a, per, unit, area, measurement, or, per, unit, of, production, and, whether, analysis, is, done, on, isolated, plots, or, on, farm, units, as, a, whole, measurements, of, biodiversity, are, highly, variable, between, studies, farms, and, organism, groups, birds, predatory, insects, soil, organisms, and, plants, responded, positively, to, organic, farming, while, non, predatory, insects, and, pests, did, not, a, 2005, review, found, that, the, positive, effects, of, organic, farming, on, abundance, were, prominent, at, the, plot, and, field, scales, but, not, for, farms, in, matched, landscapes, other, studies, that, have, attempted, to, examine, and, compare, conventional, and, organic, systems, of, farming, and, have, found, that, organic, techniques, reduce, levels, of, biodiversity, less, than, conventional, systems, do, and, use, less, energy, and, produce, less, waste, when, calculated, per, unit, area, although, not, when, calculated, per, unit, of, output, farm, comparisons, show, that, actual, nitrate, leaching, rates, per, hectare, are, up, to, 57, lower, on, organic, than, on, conventional, fields, however, the, leaching, rates, per, unit, of, output, were, similar, or, slightly, higher, on, a, per, hectare, scale, the, co, 2, emissions, are, 40, 60, lower, in, organic, farming, systems, than, in, conventional, ones, whereas, on, a, per, unit, output, scale, the, co, 2, emissions, tend, to, be, higher, in, organic, farming, systems, it, has, been, proposed, that, organic, agriculture, can, reduce, the, level, of, some, negative, externalities, from, conventional, agriculture, whether, the, benefits, are, private, or, public, depends, upon, the, division, of, property, rights, according, to, a, meta, analysis, published, in, 2017, compared, to, conventional, agriculture, biological, agriculture, has, a, higher, land, requirement, per, yield, unit, a, higher, eutrophication, potential, a, higher, acidification, potential, and, a, lower, energy, requirement, but, is, associated, with, similarly, high, greenhouse, gas, emissions, a, 2003, to, 2005, investigation, by, the, cranfield, university, for, the, department, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, in, the, uk, found, that, it, is, difficult, to, compare, the, global, warming, potential, acidification, and, eutrophication, emissions, but, organic, production, often, results, in, increased, burdens, from, factors, such, as, n, leaching, and, n, 2, o, emissions, even, though, primary, energy, use, was, less, for, most, organic, products, n, 2, o, is, always, the, largest, global, warming, potential, contributor, except, in, tomatoes, however, organic, tomatoes, always, incur, more, burdens, except, pesticide, use, some, emissions, were, lower, per, area, but, organic, farming, always, required, 65, to, 200, more, field, area, than, non, organic, farming, the, numbers, were, highest, for, bread, wheat, 200, more, and, potatoes, 160, more, as, of, 2020, it, seems, that, organic, agriculture, can, help, in, mitigating, climate, change, but, only, if, used, in, certain, ways, yield, from, organic, farming, is, significantly, lower, than, that, from, conventional, farming, ranging, between, 40, and, 85, of, the, latter, the, premiums, on, organic, foods, is, also, 150, higher, than, those, from, conventional, farms, which, is, presented, as, an, advantage, for, producers, partially, compensating, lower, yield, but, is, at, the, same, time, a, disadvantage, for, consumers, researchers, at, oxford, university, analysed, 71, peer, reviewed, studies, and, observed, that, organic, products, are, sometimes, worse, for, the, environment, organic, milk, cereals, and, pork, generated, higher, greenhouse, gas, emissions, per, product, than, conventional, ones, but, organic, beef, and, olives, had, lower, emissions, in, most, studies, usually, organic, products, required, less, energy, but, more, land, per, unit, of, product, organic, produce, generates, higher, nitrogen, leaching, nitrous, oxide, emissions, ammonia, emissions, eutrophication, and, acidification, potential, than, conventionally, grown, produce, other, differences, were, not, significant, the, researchers, concluded, that, public, debate, should, consider, various, manners, of, employing, conventional, or, organic, farming, and, not, merely, debate, conventional, farming, as, opposed, to, organic, farming, they, also, sought, to, find, specific, solutions, to, specific, circumstances, a, 2018, review, article, in, the, annual, review, of, resource, economics, found, that, organic, agriculture, is, more, polluting, per, unit, of, output, and, that, widespread, upscaling, of, organic, agriculture, would, cause, additional, loss, of, natural, habitats, proponents, of, organic, farming, have, claimed, that, organic, agriculture, emphasizes, closed, nutrient, cycles, biodiversity, and, effective, soil, management, providing, the, capacity, to, mitigate, and, even, reverse, the, effects, of, climate, change, and, that, organic, agriculture, can, decrease, fossil, fuel, emissions, the, carbon, sequestration, efficiency, of, organic, systems, in, temperate, climates, is, almost, double, 575, 700, kilograms, per, hectare, per, year, 16, 3, 19, 8, lb, acre, ms, that, of, conventional, treatment, of, soils, mainly, owing, to, the, use, of, grass, clovers, for, feed, and, of, cover, crops, in, organic, rotations, however, studies, acknowledge, organic, systems, require, more, acreage, to, produce, the, same, yield, as, conventional, farms, by, converting, to, organic, farms, in, developed, countries, where, most, arable, land, is, accounted, for, increased, deforestation, would, decrease, overall, carbon, sequestration, according, to, a, 2012, meta, analysis, of, 71, studies, nitrogen, leaching, nitrous, oxide, emissions, ammonia, emissions, eutrophication, potential, and, acidification, potential, were, higher, for, organic, products, specifically, the, emission, per, area, of, land, is, lower, but, per, amount, of, food, produced, is, higher, this, is, due, to, the, lower, crop, yield, of, organic, farms, excess, nutrients, in, lakes, rivers, and, groundwater, can, cause, algal, blooms, eutrophication, and, subsequent, dead, zones, in, addition, nitrates, are, harmful, to, aquatic, organisms, by, themselves, a, 2012, oxford, meta, analysis, of, 71, studies, found, that, organic, farming, requires, 84, more, land, for, an, equivalent, amount, of, harvest, mainly, due, to, lack, of, nutrients, but, sometimes, due, to, weeds, diseases, or, pests, lower, yielding, animals, and, land, required, for, fertility, building, crops, while, organic, farming, does, not, necessarily, save, land, for, wildlife, habitats, and, forestry, in, all, cases, the, most, modern, breakthroughs, in, organic, are, addressing, these, issues, with, success, professor, wolfgang, branscheid, says, that, organic, animal, production, is, not, good, for, the, environment, because, organic, chicken, requires, twice, as, much, land, as, conventional, chicken, and, organic, pork, a, quarter, more, according, to, a, calculation, by, hudson, institute, organic, beef, requires, three, times, as, much, land, on, the, other, hand, certain, organic, methods, of, animal, husbandry, have, been, shown, to, restore, desertified, marginal, and, or, otherwise, unavailable, land, to, agricultural, productivity, and, wildlife, or, by, getting, both, forage, and, cash, crop, production, from, the, same, fields, simultaneously, reduce, net, land, use, sri, methods, for, rice, production, without, external, inputs, have, produced, record, yields, on, some, farms, but, not, others, in, organic, farming, the, use, of, synthetic, pesticides, and, certain, natural, compounds, that, are, produced, using, chemical, synthesis, are, prohibited, the, organic, labels, restrictions, are, not, only, based, on, the, nature, of, the, compound, but, also, on, the, method, of, production, a, non, exhaustive, list, of, organic, approved, pesticides, with, their, median, lethal, doses, while, there, may, be, some, differences, in, the, amounts, of, nutrients, and, anti, nutrients, when, organically, produced, food, and, conventionally, produced, food, are, compared, the, variable, nature, of, food, production, and, handling, makes, it, difficult, to, generalize, results, and, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, make, claims, that, organic, food, is, safer, or, healthier, than, conventional, food, supporters, claim, that, organically, managed, soil, has, a, higher, quality, and, higher, water, retention, this, may, help, increase, yields, for, organic, farms, in, drought, years, organic, farming, can, build, up, soil, organic, matter, better, than, conventional, no, till, farming, which, suggests, long, term, yield, benefits, from, organic, farming, an, 18, year, study, of, organic, methods, on, nutrient, depleted, soil, concluded, that, conventional, methods, were, superior, for, soil, fertility, and, yield, for, nutrient, depleted, soils, in, cold, temperate, climates, arguing, that, much, of, the, benefit, from, organic, farming, derives, from, imported, materials, that, could, not, be, regarded, as, self, sustaining, in, dirt, the, erosion, of, civilizations, geomorphologist, david, montgomery, outlines, a, coming, crisis, from, soil, erosion, agriculture, relies, on, roughly, one, meter, of, topsoil, and, that, is, being, depleted, ten, times, faster, than, it, is, being, replaced, no, till, farming, which, some, claim, depends, upon, pesticides, is, one, way, to, minimize, erosion, however, a, 2007, study, by, the, usda, s, agricultural, research, service, has, found, that, manure, applications, in, tilled, organic, farming, are, better, at, building, up, the, soil, than, no, till, gunsmoke, farms, a, 137, square, kilometres, 53, square, miles, organic, farming, project, in, south, dakota, suffered, from, massive, soil, erosion, as, result, of, tiling, after, it, switched, to, organic, farming, the, conservation, of, natural, resources, and, biodiversity, is, a, core, principle, of, organic, production, three, broad, management, practices, prohibition, reduced, use, of, chemical, pesticides, and, inorganic, fertilizers, sympathetic, management, of, non, cropped, habitats, and, preservation, of, mixed, farming, that, are, largely, intrinsic, but, not, exclusive, to, organic, farming, are, particularly, beneficial, for, farmland, wildlife, using, practices, that, attract, or, introduce, beneficial, insects, provide, habitat, for, birds, and, mammals, and, provide, conditions, that, increase, soil, biotic, diversity, serve, to, supply, vital, ecological, services, to, organic, production, systems, advantages, to, certified, organic, operations, that, implement, these, types, of, production, practices, include, 1, decreased, dependence, on, outside, fertility, inputs, 2, reduced, pest, management, costs, 3, more, reliable, sources, of, clean, water, and, 4, better, pollination, nearly, all, non, crop, naturally, occurring, species, observed, in, comparative, farm, land, practice, studies, show, a, preference, for, organic, farming, both, by, abundance, and, diversity, an, average, of, 30, more, species, inhabit, organic, farms, birds, butterflies, soil, microbes, beetles, earthworms, spiders, vegetation, and, mammals, are, particularly, affected, lack, of, herbicides, and, pesticides, improve, biodiversity, fitness, and, population, density, many, weed, species, attract, beneficial, insects, that, improve, soil, qualities, and, forage, on, weed, pests, soil, bound, organisms, often, benefit, because, of, increased, bacteria, populations, due, to, natural, fertilizer, such, as, manure, while, experiencing, reduced, intake, of, herbicides, and, pesticides, increased, biodiversity, especially, from, beneficial, soil, microbes, and, mycorrhizae, have, been, proposed, as, an, explanation, for, the, high, yields, experienced, by, some, organic, plots, especially, in, light, of, the, differences, seen, in, a, 21, year, comparison, of, organic, and, control, fields, organic, farming, contributes, to, human, capital, by, promoting, biodiversity, the, presence, of, various, species, in, organic, farms, helps, to, reduce, human, input, such, as, fertilizers, and, pesticides, which, enhances, sustainability, the, usda, s, agricultural, marketing, service, ams, published, a, federal, register, notice, on, 15, january, 2016, announcing, the, national, organic, program, nop, final, guidance, on, natural, resources, and, biodiversity, conservation, for, certified, organic, operations, given, the, broad, scope, of, natural, resources, which, includes, soil, water, wetland, woodland, and, wildlife, the, guidance, provides, examples, of, practices, that, support, the, underlying, conservation, principles, and, demonstrate, compliance, with, usda, organic, regulations, 205, 200, the, final, guidance, provides, organic, certifiers, and, farms, with, examples, of, production, practices, that, support, conservation, principles, and, comply, with, the, usda, organic, regulations, which, require, operations, to, maintain, or, improve, natural, resources, the, final, guidance, also, clarifies, the, role, of, certified, operations, to, submit, an, osp, to, a, certifier, certifiers, ensure, that, the, osp, describes, or, lists, practices, that, explain, the, operator, s, monitoring, plan, and, practices, to, support, natural, resources, and, biodiversity, conservation, and, inspectors, onsite, inspection, in, the, implementation, and, verification, of, these, production, practices, a, wide, range, of, organisms, benefit, from, organic, farming, but, it, is, unclear, whether, organic, methods, confer, greater, benefits, than, conventional, integrated, agri, environmental, programs, organic, farming, is, often, presented, as, a, more, biodiversity, friendly, practice, but, the, generality, of, the, beneficial, effects, of, organic, farming, is, debated, as, the, effects, appear, often, species, and, context, dependent, and, current, research, has, highlighted, the, need, to, quantify, the, relative, effects, of, local, and, landscape, scale, management, on, farmland, biodiversity, there, are, four, key, issues, when, comparing, the, impacts, on, biodiversity, of, organic, and, conventional, farming, 1, it, remains, unclear, whether, a, holistic, whole, farm, approach, i, e, organic, provides, greater, benefits, to, biodiversity, than, carefully, targeted, prescriptions, applied, to, relatively, small, areas, of, cropped, and, or, non, cropped, habitats, within, conventional, agriculture, i, e, agri, environment, schemes, 2, many, comparative, studies, encounter, methodological, problems, limiting, their, ability, to, draw, quantitative, conclusions, 3, our, knowledge, of, the, impacts, of, organic, farming, in, pastoral, and, upland, agriculture, is, limited, 4, there, remains, a, pressing, need, for, longitudinal, system, level, studies, in, order, to, address, these, issues, and, to, fill, in, the, gaps, in, our, knowledge, of, the, impacts, of, organic, farming, before, a, full, appraisal, of, its, potential, role, in, biodiversity, conservation, in, agroecosystems, can, be, made, organic, agriculture, is, often, considered, to, be, more, socially, just, and, economically, sustainable, for, farmworkers, than, conventional, agriculture, however, there, is, little, social, science, research, or, consensus, as, to, whether, or, not, organic, agriculture, provides, better, working, conditions, than, conventional, agriculture, as, many, consumers, equate, organic, and, sustainable, agriculture, with, small, scale, family, owned, organizations, it, is, widely, interpreted, that, buying, organic, supports, better, conditions, for, farmworkers, than, buying, with, conventional, producers, organic, agriculture, is, generally, more, labour, intensive, due, to, its, dependence, on, manual, practices, for, fertilization, and, pest, removal, although, illnesses, from, inputs, pose, less, of, a, risk, hired, workers, still, fall, victim, to, debilitating, musculoskeletal, disorders, associated, with, agricultural, work, the, usda, certification, requirements, outline, growing, practices, and, ecological, standards, but, do, nothing, to, codify, labour, practices, independent, certification, initiatives, such, as, the, agricultural, justice, project, domestic, fair, trade, working, group, and, the, food, alliance, have, attempted, to, implement, farmworker, interests, but, because, these, initiatives, require, voluntary, participation, of, organic, farms, their, standards, cannot, be, widely, enforced, despite, the, benefit, to, farmworkers, of, implementing, labour, standards, there, is, little, support, among, the, organic, community, for, these, social, requirements, many, actors, of, the, organic, industry, believe, that, enforcing, labour, standards, would, be, unnecessary, unacceptable, or, unviable, due, to, the, constraints, of, the, market, the, following, is, a, selected, list, of, support, given, in, some, regions, the, eu, organic, production, regulation, is, a, part, of, the, european, union, regulation, that, sets, rules, about, the, production, of, organic, agricultural, and, livestock, products, and, how, to, label, them, in, the, eu, organic, farming, and, organic, food, are, more, commonly, known, as, ecological, or, biological, the, regulation, is, derived, from, the, guidelines, of, the, international, federation, of, organic, agriculture, movements, ifoam, which, is, an, association, of, about, 800, member, organizations, in, 119, countries, as, in, the, rest, of, the, world, the, organic, market, in, europe, continues, to, grow, and, more, land, is, farmed, organically, each, year, more, farmers, cultivate, organically, more, land, is, certified, organic, and, more, countries, report, organic, farming, activities, as, per, the, 2016, edition, of, the, study, the, world, of, organic, agriculture, archived, 11, november, 2017, at, the, wayback, machine, according, to, data, from, the, end, of, 2014, published, by, fibl, and, ifoam, in, 2016, denmark, has, a, long, ongoing, support, for, converting, conventional, farming, into, organic, farming, which, has, been, taught, in, academic, classes, in, universities, since, 1986, the, state, began, substitutes, and, has, promoted, a, special, national, label, for, products, that, qualify, as, organic, since, 1989, denmark, is, thus, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, substitute, organic, farming, promoting, the, concept, and, organizing, the, distribution, of, organic, products, today, the, government, accept, applicants, for, financial, support, during, conversion, years, as, in, danish, regulations, farms, must, not, have, utilized, conventional, farming, methods, such, as, the, usage, of, pesticides, for, several, years, before, products, can, be, assessed, for, qualification, as, organic, this, financial, support, has, in, recent, years, been, cut, due, to, organic, farming, increasing, in, profitability, and, some, goods, surpassing, the, profitability, of, conventional, farming, in, domestic, markets, in, general, the, financial, situation, of, organic, farmers, in, denmark, boomed, between, 2010, and, 2018, while, in, 2018, serious, nationwide, long, lasting, droughts, stagnated, the, economic, results, of, organic, farmers, however, the, average, farmer, still, achieved, a, net, positive, result, that, year, in, 2021, denmark, s, and, europe, s, largest, slaughterhouse, danish, crown, publicized, its, expectations, of, stagnating, sales, of, conventional, pork, domestically, however, it, expected, increasing, sales, of, organic, pork, and, especially, free, range, organic, pork, besides, the, conversion, support, there, are, still, base, subsidies, for, organic, farming, paid, per, area, of, qualified, farm, land, the, first, danish, private, development, organisation, sams, kologisk, was, established, in, 2013, by, veteran, organic, farmers, from, the, existing, organisation, kologisk, sams, the, development, organisation, has, intentions, to, buy, and, invest, in, farmland, and, then, lend, the, land, to, young, and, aspiring, farmers, seeking, to, get, into, farming, especially, organic, farming, this, organisation, reports, 300, economical, active, members, as, of, 2021, but, does, not, publish, the, amount, of, acquired, land, or, active, lenders, however, the, organic, farming, concept, in, denmark, is, often, not, limited, to, organic, farming, as, the, definition, is, globally, instead, the, majority, of, organic, farming, is, instead, ecological, farming, the, development, of, this, concept, has, been, parallel, with, the, general, organic, farming, movement, and, is, most, often, used, interchangeable, with, organic, farming, thus, there, is, a, much, stronger, focus, on, the, environmental, and, especially, the, ecological, impact, of, ecological, farming, than, organic, farming, e, g, besides, the, base, substitute, for, organic, farming, farmers, can, qualify, for, an, extra, substitute, equal, to, 2, 3, of, the, base, for, realizing, a, specific, reduction, in, the, usage, of, added, nitrogen, to, the, farmland, also, by, organic, means, there, are, also, parallels, to, the, extended, organic, movements, of, regenerative, agriculture, although, far, from, all, concepts, in, regenerative, agriculture, are, included, in, the, national, strategy, at, this, time, but, exist, as, voluntary, options, for, each, farmer, for, these, reasons, international, organic, products, do, not, fulfill, the, requirements, of, ecological, farming, and, thus, do, not, receive, the, domestic, label, for, ecological, products, rather, they, receive, the, standard, european, union, organic, label, the, ministry, of, agrarian, policy, and, food, of, ukraine, is, the, central, executive, body, that, develops, the, regulatory, framework, for, the, organic, sector, in, ukraine, maintains, the, state, registers, of, certification, bodies, operators, and, organic, seeds, and, planting, material, and, provides, training, and, professional, development, for, organic, inspectors, thanks, to, the, hard, work, on, organic, legislation, by,

verkhovna, rada, of, ukraine, the, ukrainian, parliament, adopted, the, law, of, ukraine, on, basic, principles, and, requirements, for, organic, production, circulation, and, labelling, of, organic, products, no, 2496, which, was, enacted, on, 2, august, 2019, as, of, april, 2024, organic, production, circulation, and, labelling, of, organic, products, in, ukraine, is, regulated, by, this, law, as, well, as, relevant, by, laws, one, more, important, governmental, institution, of, the, organic, sector, of, ukraine, is, the, state, service, of, ukraine, on, food, safety, and, consumer, protection, it, is, the, central, executive, body, authorised, to, conduct, state, supervision, control, in, the, field, of, organic, production, circulation, and, labelling, of, organic, products, in, accordance, with, the, organic, legislation, of, ukraine, this, includes, state, supervision, control, over, compliance, with, the, legislation, in, the, field, of, organic, production, circulation, and, labelling, of, organic, products, inspection, of, certification, bodies, random, inspection, of, operators, monitoring, of, organic, products, on, the, market, to, prevent, the,

implementation, of, the, legislation, in, the, field, of, organic, production, circulation, and, labelling, of, organic, products, and, support, various, activities, related, to, organic, farming, and, production, the, chinese, government, especially, the, local, government, has, provided, various, supports, for, the, development, of, organic, agriculture, since, the, 1990s, organic, farming, has, been, recognized, by, local, governments, for, its, potential, in, promoting, sustainable, rural, development, it, is, common, for, local, governments, to, facilitate, land, access, of, agribusinesses, by, negotiating, land, leasing, with, local, farmers, the, government, also, establishes, demonstration, organic, gardens, provides, training, for, organic, food, companies, to, pass, certifications, subsidizes, organic, certification, fees, pest, repellent, lamps, organic, fertilizer, and, so, on, the, government, has, also, been, playing, an, active, role, in, marketing, organic, products, through, organizing, organic, food, expos, and, branding, supports, in, india, in, 2016, the, northern, state, of, sikkim, achieved, its, goal, of, converting, to, 100, organic, farming, other, states, of, india, including, kerala, mizoram, goa, rajasthan, and, meghalaya, have, also, declared, their, intentions, to, shift, to, fully, organic, cultivation, the, south, indian, state, andhra, pradesh, is, also, promoting, organic, farming, especially, zero, budget, natural, farming, zbnf, which, is, a, form, of, regenerative, agriculture, as, of, 2018, india, has, the, largest, number, of, organic, farmers, in, the, world, and, constitutes, more, than, 30, of, the, organic, farmers, globally, india, has, 835, 000, certified, organic, producers, however, the, total, land, under, organic, cultivation, is, around, 2, of, overall, farm, lands, the, dominican, republic, has, successfully, converted, a, large, amount, of, its, banana, crop, to, organic, the, dominican, republic, accounts, for, 55, of, the, world, s, certified, organic, bananas, the, most, noticeable, change, in, korea, s, agriculture, occurred, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, more, specifically, the, green, revolution, program, where, south, korea, experienced, reforestations, and, agricultural, revolution, due, to, a, food, shortage, during, park, chung, hee, s, presidency, the, government, encouraged, rice, varieties, suited, for, organic, farming, farmers, were, able, to, strategize, risk, minimization, efforts, by, breeding, a, variety, of, rice, called, japonica, with, tongil, they, also, used, less, fertilizer, and, made, other, economic, adjustments, to, alleviate, potential, risk, factors, in, modern, society, organic, farming, and, food, policies, have, changed, more, specifically, since, the, 1990s, as, expected, the, guidelines, focus, on, basic, dietary, recommendations, for, consumption, of, nutrients, and, korean, style, diets, the, main, reason, for, this, encouragement, is, that, around, 88, of, countries, across, the, world, face, forms, of, malnutrition, then, in, 2009, the, special, act, on, safety, management, of, children, s, dietary, life, was, passed, restricting, foods, low, in, energy, and, poor, in, nutrients, it, also, focused, on, other, nutritional, problems, korean, students, may, have, had, as, well, in, thailand, the, institute, for, sustainable, agricultural, communities, isac, was, established, in, 1991, to, promote, organic, farming, among, other, sustainable, agricultural, practices, the, national, target, via, the, national, plan, for, organic, farming, is, to, attain, by, 2021, 1, 3, million, rai, 2, 100, square, kilometres, 800, square, miles, of, organically, farmed, land, another, target, is, for, 40, of, the, produce, from, these, farmlands, to, be, consumed, domestically, much, progress, has, been, made, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, rural, development, usdard, was, created, in, 1994, as, a, subsection, of, the, usda, that, implements, programs, to, stimulate, growth, in, rural, communities, one, of, the, programs, that, the, usdard, created, provided, grants, to, farmers, who, practiced, organic, farming, through, the, organic, certification, cost, share, program, occsp, during, the, 21st, century, the, united, states, has, continued, to, expand, its, reach, in, the, organic, foods, market, doubling, the, number, of, organic, farms, in, the, u, s, in, 2016, when, compared, to, 2011, employment, on, organic, farms, offers, potentially, large, numbers, of, jobs, for, people, and, this, may, better, manage, the, fourth, industrial, revolution, moreover, sustainable, forestry, fishing, and, mining, and, other, conservation, oriented, activities, provide, larger, numbers, of, jobs, than, more, fossil, fuel, and, mechanized, work, as, was, the, case, with, most, countries, sri, lanka, made, the, transition, away, from, organic, farming, upon, the, arrival, of, the, green, revolution, whereupon, it, started, depending, more, on, chemical, fertilizers, this, became, a, highly, popularized, method, when, the, nation, started, offering, subsidies, on, the, import, of, artificial, fertilizers, to, increase, rice, paddy, production, and, to, incentivize, farmers, to, switch, from, growing, traditional, varieties, into, using, high, yielding, varieties, hyvs, this, was, especially, true, for, young, farmers, who, saw, short, term, economic, profit, as, more, sustainable, to, their, wellbeing, compared, to, the, long, term, drawbacks, to, the, environment, however, due, to, the, various, health, concerns, with, inorganic, farming, including, the, possibility, of, a, chronic, kidney, disease, being, associated, with, chemical, fertilizers, many, middle, aged, and, experienced, farmers, displayed, skepticism, towards, these, new, approaches, some, even, resorted, to, organic, farming, or, utilizing, insecticide, free, fertilizers, for, their, crops, in, a, study, conducted, by, f, horgan, and, e, kudavidanage, the, researchers, compared, crop, yields, of, farmers, in, sri, lanka, who, employed, distinct, farming, techniques, including, organic, farmers, who, grew, traditional, varieties, and, insecticide, free, fertilizer, users, and, pesticide, users, who, grew, modern, varieties, no, significant, difference, was, found, among, the, yield, productions, and, in, fact, organic, farmers, and, insecticide, free, fertilizer, users, lamented, less, about, insects, such, as, planthoppers, as, a, challenge, to, their, production, regardless, many, farmers, continued, to, use, insecticides, to, avoid, the, predicted, dangers, of, pests, to, their, crops, and, the, cheap, sale, of, agrochemicals, provided, an, easy, approach, to, augment, crop, growth, additionally, while, organic, farming, has, health, benefits, it, s, a, strenuous, task, which, requires, more, man, power, although, that, presented, a, great, opportunity, for, increased, employment, in, sri, lanka, the, economic, compensation, was, not, enough, to, suffice, the, living, expenses, of, those, employed, thus, most, farmers, relied, on, modern, methods, to, run, their, household, especially, after, the, economic, stressors, brought, on, by, covid, 19, however, while, sri, lanka, was, still, facing, the, new, challenges, of, the, pandemic, in, the, 2019, presidential, election, campaign, the, president, gotabaya, rajapaksa, proposed, a, 10, year, national, transition, to, organic, farming, to, declare, sri, lanka, as, the, first, nation, to, be, known, for, its, organic, produce, on, april, 27, 2021, the, country, issued, an, order, prohibiting, the, import, of, any, inorganic, pesticides, or, fertilizers, creating, chaos, among, farmers, while, such, a, change, was, made, over, concerns, for, the, nation, s, ecosystems, and, the, health, of, citizens, where, pesticide, poisonings, prevailed, over, other, health, related, deaths, the, precipitous, decision, was, met, with, criticism, from, the, agriculture, industry, this, included, fears, that, the, mandate, would, harm, the, yields, of, the, country, s, major, crops, despite, claims, to, the, contrary, that, the, country, would, not, be, able, to, produce, enough, organic, fertilizer, domestically, and, organic, farming, being, more, expensive, and, complex, than, conventional, agriculture, to, put, this, into, perspective, 7, 4, of, sri, lanka, s, gdp, is, reliant, on, agriculture, and, 30, of, citizens, work, in, this, sector, this, means, that, about, of, its, population, is, dependent, on, this, sector, for, jobs, making, its, maintenance, highly, crucial, for, the, prosperity, of, the, nation, s, social, and, economic, status, of, special, concern, was, rice, and, tea, which, are, a, staple, food, and, major, export, respectively, despite, it, being, a, record, crop, in, the, first, half, of, 2021, the, tea, crop, began, to, decline, in, july, of, that, year, rice, production, fell, by, 20, over, the, first, six, months, of, the, ban, and, prices, increased, by, around, 50, contrary, to, its, past, success, at, self, sustainability, the, country, had, to, import, us, 450, million, worth, of, rice, to, meet, domestic, demand, in, late, august, the, government, acknowledged, the, ban, had, created, a, critical, dependency, on, supplies, of, imported, organic, fertilizers, but, by, then, food, prices, had, already, increased, twofold, in, some, cases, in, september, 2021, the, government, declared, an, economic, emergency, citing, the, ban, s, impact, on, food, prices, as, well, as, inflation, from, the, devaluation, of, sri, lankan, currency, due, to, the, crashing, tea, industry, and, a, lack, of, tourism, induced, by, covid, 19, restrictions, in, november, 2021, the, country, partially, lifted, the, ban, on, inorganic, farming, for, certain, key, crops, such, as, rubber, and, tea, and, began, to, offer, compensation, and, subsidies, to, farmers, and, rice, producers, in, an, attempt, to, cover, losses, the, previous, subsidies, on, synthetic, fertilizer, imports, were, not, reintroduced,
