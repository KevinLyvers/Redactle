a, crane, is, a, machine, used, to, move, materials, both, vertically, and, horizontally, utilizing, a, system, of, a, boom, hoist, wire, ropes, or, chains, and, sheaves, for, lifting, and, relocating, heavy, objects, within, the, swing, of, its, boom, the, device, uses, one, or, more, simple, machines, such, as, the, lever, and, pulley, to, create, mechanical, advantage, to, do, its, work, cranes, are, commonly, employed, in, transportation, for, the, loading, and, unloading, of, freight, in, construction, for, the, movement, of, materials, and, in, manufacturing, for, the, assembling, of, heavy, equipment, the, first, known, crane, machine, was, the, shaduf, a, water, lifting, device, that, was, invented, in, ancient, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, and, then, appeared, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, construction, cranes, later, appeared, in, ancient, greece, where, they, were, powered, by, men, or, animals, such, as, donkeys, and, used, for, the, construction, of, buildings, larger, cranes, were, later, developed, in, the, roman, empire, employing, the, use, of, human, treadwheels, permitting, the, lifting, of, heavier, weights, in, the, high, middle, ages, harbour, cranes, were, introduced, to, load, and, unload, ships, and, assist, with, their, construction, some, were, built, into, stone, towers, for, extra, strength, and, stability, the, earliest, cranes, were, constructed, from, wood, but, cast, iron, iron, and, steel, took, over, with, the, coming, of, the, industrial, revolution, for, many, centuries, power, was, supplied, by, the, physical, exertion, of, men, or, animals, although, hoists, in, watermills, and, windmills, could, be, driven, by, the, harnessed, natural, power, the, first, mechanical, power, was, provided, by, steam, engines, the, earliest, steam, crane, being, introduced, in, the, 18th, or, 19th, century, with, many, remaining, in, use, well, into, the, late, 20th, century, modern, cranes, usually, use, internal, combustion, engines, or, electric, motors, and, hydraulic, systems, to, provide, a, much, greater, lifting, capability, than, was, previously, possible, although, manual, cranes, are, still, utilized, where, the, provision, of, power, would, be, uneconomic, there, are, many, different, types, of, cranes, each, tailored, to, a, specific, use, sizes, range, from, the, smallest, jib, cranes, used, inside, workshops, to, the, tallest, tower, cranes, used, for, constructing, high, buildings, mini, cranes, are, also, used, for, constructing, high, buildings, to, facilitate, constructions, by, reaching, tight, spaces, large, floating, cranes, are, generally, used, to, build, oil, rigs, and, salvage, sunken, ships, some, lifting, machines, do, not, strictly, fit, the, above, definition, of, a, crane, but, are, generally, known, as, cranes, such, as, stacker, cranes, and, loader, cranes, cranes, were, so, called, from, the, resemblance, to, the, long, neck, of, the, bird, cf, ancient, greek, french, grue, the, first, type, of, crane, machine, was, the, shadouf, which, had, a, lever, mechanism, and, was, used, to, lift, water, for, irrigation, it, was, invented, in, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, circa, 3000, bc, the, shadouf, subsequently, appeared, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, circa, 2000, bc, a, crane, for, lifting, heavy, loads, was, developed, by, the, ancient, greeks, in, the, late, 6th, century, bc, the, archaeological, record, shows, that, no, later, than, c, 515, bc, distinctive, cuttings, for, both, lifting, tongs, and, lewis, irons, begin, to, appear, on, stone, blocks, of, greek, temples, since, these, holes, point, at, the, use, of, a, lifting, device, and, since, they, are, to, be, found, either, above, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, block, or, in, pairs, equidistant, from, a, point, over, the, center, of, gravity, they, are, regarded, by, archaeologists, as, the, positive, evidence, required, for, the, existence, of, the, crane, the, introduction, of, the, winch, and, pulley, hoist, soon, led, to, a, widespread, replacement, of, ramps, as, the, main, means, of, vertical, motion, for, the, next, 200, years, greek, building, sites, witnessed, a, sharp, reduction, in, the, weights, handled, as, the, new, lifting, technique, made, the, use, of, several, smaller, stones, more, practical, than, fewer, larger, ones, in, contrast, to, the, archaic, period, with, its, pattern, of, ever, increasing, block, sizes, greek, temples, of, the, classical, age, like, the, parthenon, invariably, featured, stone, blocks, weighing, less, than, 15, 20, metric, tons, also, the, practice, of, erecting, large, monolithic, columns, was, practically, abandoned, in, favour, of, using, several, column, drums, although, the, exact, circumstances, of, the, shift, from, the, ramp, to, the, crane, technology, remain, unclear, it, has, been, argued, that, the, volatile, social, and, political, conditions, of, greece, were, more, suitable, to, the, employment, of, small, professional, construction, teams, than, of, large, bodies, of, unskilled, labour, making, the, crane, preferable, to, the, greek, polis, over, the, more, labour, intensive, ramp, which, had, been, the, norm, in, the, autocratic, societies, of, egypt, or, assyria, the, first, unequivocal, literary, evidence, for, the, existence, of, the, compound, pulley, system, appears, in, the, mechanical, problems, mech, 18, 853a32, 853b13, attributed, to, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, but, perhaps, composed, at, a, slightly, later, date, around, the, same, time, block, sizes, at, greek, temples, began, to, match, their, archaic, predecessors, again, indicating, that, the, more, sophisticated, compound, pulley, must, have, found, its, way, to, greek, construction, sites, by, then, the, heyday, of, the, crane, in, ancient, times, came, during, the, roman, empire, when, construction, activity, soared, and, buildings, reached, enormous, dimensions, the, romans, adopted, the, greek, crane, and, developed, it, further, there, is, much, available, information, about, their, lifting, techniques, thanks, to, rather, lengthy, accounts, by, the, engineers, vitruvius, de, architectura, 10, 2, 1, 10, and, heron, of, alexandria, mechanica, 3, 2, 5, there, are, also, two, surviving, reliefs, of, roman, treadwheel, cranes, with, the, haterii, tombstone, from, the, late, first, century, ad, being, particularly, detailed, the, simplest, roman, crane, the, trispastos, consisted, of, a, single, beam, jib, a, winch, a, rope, and, a, block, containing, three, pulleys, having, thus, a, mechanical, advantage, of, 3, 1, it, has, been, calculated, that, a, single, man, working, the, winch, could, raise, 150, kg, 330, lb, 3, pulleys, x, 50, kg, or, 110, lb, 150, assuming, that, 50, kg, 110, lb, represent, the, maximum, effort, a, man, can, exert, over, a, longer, time, period, heavier, crane, types, featured, five, pulleys, pentaspastos, or, in, case, of, the, largest, one, a, set, of, three, by, five, pulleys, polyspastos, and, came, with, two, three, or, four, masts, depending, on, the, maximum, load, the, polyspastos, when, worked, by, four, men, at, both, sides, of, the, winch, could, readily, lift, 3, 000, kg, 6, 600, lb, 3, ropes, x, 5, pulleys, x, 4, men, x, 50, kg, or, 110, lb, 3, 000, kg, or, 6, 600, lb, if, the, winch, was, replaced, by, a, treadwheel, the, maximum, load, could, be, doubled, to, 6, 000, kg, 13, 000, lb, at, only, half, the, crew, since, the, treadwheel, possesses, a, much, bigger, mechanical, advantage, due, to, its, larger, diameter, this, meant, that, in, comparison, to, the, construction, of, the, ancient, egyptian, pyramids, where, about, 50, men, were, needed, to, move, a, 2, 5, ton, stone, block, up, the, ramp, 50, kg, 110, lb, per, person, the, lifting, capability, of, the, roman, polyspastos, proved, to, be, 60, times, higher, 3, 000, kg, or, 6, 600, lb, per, person, however, numerous, extant, roman, buildings, which, feature, much, heavier, stone, blocks, than, those, handled, by, the, polyspastos, indicate, that, the, overall, lifting, capability, of, the, romans, went, far, beyond, that, of, any, single, crane, at, the, temple, of, jupiter, at, baalbek, for, instance, the, architrave, blocks, weigh, up, to, 60, tons, each, and, one, corner, cornice, block, even, over, 100, tons, all, of, them, raised, to, a, height, of, about, 19, m, 62, 3, ft, in, rome, the, capital, block, of, trajan, s, column, weighs, 53, 3, tons, which, had, to, be, lifted, to, a, height, of, about, 34, m, 111, 5, ft, see, construction, of, trajan, s, column, it, is, assumed, that, roman, engineers, lifted, these, extraordinary, weights, by, two, measures, see, picture, below, for, comparable, renaissance, technique, first, as, suggested, by, heron, a, lifting, tower, was, set, up, whose, four, masts, were, arranged, in, the, shape, of, a, quadrangle, with, parallel, sides, not, unlike, a, siege, tower, but, with, the, column, in, the, middle, of, the, structure, mechanica, 3, 5, second, a, multitude, of, capstans, were, placed, on, the, ground, around, the, tower, for, although, having, a, lower, leverage, ratio, than, treadwheels, capstans, could, be, set, up, in, higher, numbers, and, run, by, more, men, and, moreover, by, draught, animals, this, use, of, multiple, capstans, is, also, described, by, ammianus, marcellinus, 17, 4, 15, in, connection, with, the, lifting, of, the, lateranense, obelisk, in, the, circus, maximus, c, 357, ad, the, maximum, lifting, capability, of, a, single, capstan, can, be, established, by, the, number, of, lewis, iron, holes, bored, into, the, monolith, in, case, of, the, baalbek, architrave, blocks, which, weigh, between, 55, and, 60, tons, eight, extant, holes, suggest, an, allowance, of, 7, 5, ton, per, lewis, iron, that, is, per, capstan, lifting, such, heavy, weights, in, a, concerted, action, required, a, great, amount, of, coordination, between, the, work, groups, applying, the, force, to, the, capstans, during, the, high, middle, ages, the, treadwheel, crane, was, reintroduced, on, a, large, scale, after, the, technology, had, fallen, into, disuse, in, western, europe, with, the, demise, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, earliest, reference, to, a, treadwheel, magna, rota, reappears, in, archival, literature, in, france, about, 1225, followed, by, an, illuminated, depiction, in, a, manuscript, of, probably, also, french, origin, dating, to, 1240, in, navigation, the, earliest, uses, of, harbor, cranes, are, documented, for, utrecht, in, 1244, antwerp, in, 1263, bruges, in, 1288, and, hamburg, in, 1291, while, in, england, the, treadwheel, is, not, recorded, before, 1331, generally, vertical, transport, could, be, done, more, safely, and, inexpensively, by, cranes, than, by, customary, methods, typical, areas, of, application, were, harbors, mines, and, in, particular, building, sites, where, the, treadwheel, crane, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, construction, of, the, lofty, gothic, cathedrals, nevertheless, both, archival, and, pictorial, sources, of, the, time, suggest, that, newly, introduced, machines, like, treadwheels, or, wheelbarrows, did, not, completely, replace, more, labor, intensive, methods, like, ladders, hods, and, handbarrows, rather, old, and, new, machinery, continued, to, coexist, on, medieval, construction, sites, and, harbors, apart, from, treadwheels, medieval, depictions, also, show, cranes, to, be, powered, manually, by, windlasses, with, radiating, spokes, cranks, and, by, the, 15th, century, also, by, windlasses, shaped, like, a, ship, s, wheel, to, smooth, out, irregularities, of, impulse, and, get, over, dead, spots, in, the, lifting, process, flywheels, are, known, to, be, in, use, as, early, as, 1123, the, exact, process, by, which, the, treadwheel, crane, was, reintroduced, is, not, recorded, although, its, return, to, construction, sites, has, undoubtedly, to, be, viewed, in, close, connection, with, the, simultaneous, rise, of, gothic, architecture, the, reappearance, of, the, treadwheel, crane, may, have, resulted, from, a, technological, development, of, the, windlass, from, which, the, treadwheel, structurally, and, mechanically, evolved, alternatively, the, medieval, treadwheel, may, represent, a, deliberate, reinvention, of, its, roman, counterpart, drawn, from, vitruvius, de, architectura, which, was, available, in, many, monastic, libraries, its, reintroduction, may, have, been, inspired, as, well, by, the, observation, of, the, labor, saving, qualities, of, the, waterwheel, with, which, early, treadwheels, shared, many, structural, similarities, the, medieval, treadwheel, was, a, large, wooden, wheel, turning, around, a, central, shaft, with, a, treadway, wide, enough, for, two, workers, walking, side, by, side, while, the, earlier, compass, arm, wheel, had, spokes, directly, driven, into, the, central, shaft, the, more, advanced, clasp, arm, type, featured, arms, arranged, as, chords, to, the, wheel, rim, giving, the, possibility, of, using, a, thinner, shaft, and, providing, thus, a, greater, mechanical, advantage, contrary, to, a, popularly, held, belief, cranes, on, medieval, building, sites, were, neither, placed, on, the, extremely, lightweight, scaffolding, used, at, the, time, nor, on, the, thin, walls, of, the, gothic, churches, which, were, incapable, of, supporting, the, weight, of, both, hoisting, machine, and, load, rather, cranes, were, placed, in, the, initial, stages, of, construction, on, the, ground, often, within, the, building, when, a, new, floor, was, completed, and, massive, tie, beams, of, the, roof, connected, the, walls, the, crane, was, dismantled, and, reassembled, on, the, roof, beams, from, where, it, was, moved, from, bay, to, bay, during, construction, of, the, vaults, thus, the, crane, grew, and, wandered, with, the, building, with, the, result, that, today, all, extant, construction, cranes, in, england, are, found, in, church, towers, above, the, vaulting, and, below, the, roof, where, they, remained, after, building, construction, for, bringing, material, for, repairs, aloft, less, frequently, medieval, illuminations, also, show, cranes, mounted, on, the, outside, of, walls, with, the, stand, of, the, machine, secured, to, putlogs, in, contrast, to, modern, cranes, medieval, cranes, and, hoists, much, like, their, counterparts, in, greece, and, rome, were, primarily, capable, of, a, vertical, lift, and, not, used, to, move, loads, for, a, considerable, distance, horizontally, as, well, accordingly, lifting, work, was, organized, at, the, workplace, in, a, different, way, than, today, in, building, construction, for, example, it, is, assumed, that, the, crane, lifted, the, stone, blocks, either, from, the, bottom, directly, into, place, or, from, a, place, opposite, the, centre, of, the, wall, from, where, it, could, deliver, the, blocks, for, two, teams, working, at, each, end, of, the, wall, additionally, the, crane, master, who, usually, gave, orders, at, the, treadwheel, workers, from, outside, the, crane, was, able, to, manipulate, the, movement, laterally, by, a, small, rope, attached, to, the, load, slewing, cranes, which, allowed, a, rotation, of, the, load, and, were, thus, particularly, suited, for, dockside, work, appeared, as, early, as, 1340, while, ashlar, blocks, were, directly, lifted, by, sling, lewis, or, devil, s, clamp, german, teufelskralle, other, objects, were, placed, before, in, containers, like, pallets, baskets, wooden, boxes, or, barrels, it, is, noteworthy, that, medieval, cranes, rarely, featured, ratchets, or, brakes, to, forestall, the, load, from, running, backward, this, curious, absence, is, explained, by, the, high, friction, force, exercised, by, medieval, tread, wheels, which, normally, prevented, the, wheel, from, accelerating, beyond, control, according, to, the, present, state, of, knowledge, unknown, in, antiquity, stationary, harbor, cranes, are, considered, a, new, development, of, the, middle, ages, the, typical, harbor, crane, was, a, pivoting, structure, equipped, with, double, treadwheels, these, cranes, were, placed, docksides, for, the, loading, and, unloading, of, cargo, where, they, replaced, or, complemented, older, lifting, methods, like, see, saws, winches, and, yards, two, different, types, of, harbor, cranes, can, be, identified, with, a, varying, geographical, distribution, while, gantry, cranes, which, pivoted, on, a, central, vertical, axle, were, commonly, found, at, the, flemish, and, dutch, coastside, german, sea, and, inland, harbors, typically, featured, tower, cranes, where, the, windlass, and, treadwheels, were, situated, in, a, solid, tower, with, only, jib, arm, and, roof, rotating, dockside, cranes, were, not, adopted, in, the, mediterranean, region, and, the, highly, developed, italian, ports, where, authorities, continued, to, rely, on, the, more, labor, intensive, method, of, unloading, goods, by, ramps, beyond, the, middle, ages, unlike, construction, cranes, where, the, work, speed, was, determined, by, the, relatively, slow, progress, of, the, masons, harbor, cranes, usually, featured, double, treadwheels, to, speed, up, loading, the, two, treadwheels, whose, diameter, is, estimated, to, be, 4, m, or, larger, were, attached, to, each, side, of, the, axle, and, rotated, together, their, capacity, was, 2, 3, tons, which, apparently, corresponded, to, the, customary, size, of, marine, cargo, today, according, to, one, survey, fifteen, treadwheel, harbor, cranes, from, pre, industrial, times, are, still, extant, throughout, europe, some, harbour, cranes, were, specialised, at, mounting, masts, to, newly, built, sailing, ships, such, as, in, gda, sk, cologne, and, bremen, beside, these, stationary, cranes, floating, cranes, which, could, be, flexibly, deployed, in, the, whole, port, basin, came, into, use, by, the, 14th, century, a, sheer, hulk, or, shear, hulk, was, used, in, shipbuilding, and, repair, as, a, floating, crane, in, the, days, of, sailing, ships, primarily, to, place, the, lower, masts, of, a, ship, under, construction, or, repair, booms, known, as, sheers, were, attached, to, the, base, of, a, hulk, s, lower, masts, or, beam, supported, from, the, top, of, those, masts, blocks, and, tackle, were, then, used, in, such, tasks, as, placing, or, removing, the, lower, masts, of, the, vessel, under, construction, or, repair, these, lower, masts, were, the, largest, and, most, massive, single, timbers, aboard, a, ship, and, erecting, them, without, the, assistance, of, either, a, sheer, hulk, or, land, based, masting, sheer, was, extremely, difficult, the, concept, of, sheer, hulks, originated, with, the, royal, navy, in, the, 1690s, and, persisted, in, britain, until, the, early, nineteenth, century, most, sheer, hulks, were, decommissioned, warships, chatham, built, in, 1694, was, the, first, of, only, three, purpose, built, vessels, there, were, at, least, six, sheer, hulks, in, service, in, britain, at, any, time, throughout, the, 1700s, the, concept, spread, to, france, in, the, 1740s, with, the, commissioning, of, a, sheer, hulk, at, the, port, of, rochefort, a, lifting, tower, similar, to, that, of, the, ancient, romans, was, used, to, great, effect, by, the, renaissance, architect, domenico, fontana, in, 1586, to, relocate, the, 361, t, heavy, vatican, obelisk, in, rome, from, his, report, it, becomes, obvious, that, the, coordination, of, the, lift, between, the, various, pulling, teams, required, a, considerable, amount, of, concentration, and, discipline, since, if, the, force, was, not, applied, evenly, the, excessive, stress, on, the, ropes, would, make, them, rupture, cranes, were, also, used, domestically, during, this, period, the, chimney, or, fireplace, crane, was, used, to, swing, pots, and, kettles, over, the, fire, and, the, height, was, adjusted, by, a, trammel, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, first, modern, cranes, were, installed, at, harbours, for, loading, cargo, in, 1838, the, industrialist, and, businessman, william, armstrong, designed, a, water, powered, hydraulic, crane, his, design, used, a, ram, in, a, closed, cylinder, that, was, forced, down, by, a, pressurized, fluid, entering, the, cylinder, and, a, valve, regulated, the, amount, of, fluid, intake, relative, to, the, load, on, the, crane, this, mechanism, the, hydraulic, jigger, then, pulled, on, a, chain, to, lift, the, load, in, 1845, a, scheme, was, set, in, motion, to, provide, piped, water, from, distant, reservoirs, to, the, households, of, newcastle, armstrong, was, involved, in, this, scheme, and, he, proposed, to, newcastle, corporation, that, the, excess, water, pressure, in, the, lower, part, of, town, could, be, used, to, power, one, of, his, hydraulic, cranes, for, the, loading, of, coal, onto, barges, at, the, quayside, he, claimed, that, his, invention, would, do, the, job, faster, and, more, cheaply, than, conventional, cranes, the, corporation, agreed, to, his, suggestion, and, the, experiment, proved, so, successful, that, three, more, hydraulic, cranes, were, installed, on, the, quayside, the, success, of, his, hydraulic, crane, led, armstrong, to, establish, the, elswick, works, at, newcastle, to, produce, his, hydraulic, machinery, for, cranes, and, bridges, in, 1847, his, company, soon, received, orders, for, hydraulic, cranes, from, edinburgh, and, northern, railways, and, from, liverpool, docks, as, well, as, for, hydraulic, machinery, for, dock, gates, in, grimsby, the, company, expanded, from, a, workforce, of, 300, and, an, annual, production, of, 45, cranes, in, 1850, to, almost, 4, 000, workers, producing, over, 100, cranes, per, year, by, the, early, 1860s, armstrong, spent, the, next, few, decades, constantly, improving, his, crane, design, his, most, significant, innovation, was, the, hydraulic, accumulator, where, water, pressure, was, not, available, on, site, for, the, use, of, hydraulic, cranes, armstrong, often, built, high, water, towers, to, provide, a, supply, of, water, at, pressure, however, when, supplying, cranes, for, use, at, new, holland, on, the, humber, estuary, he, was, unable, to, do, this, because, the, foundations, consisted, of, sand, he, eventually, produced, the, hydraulic, accumulator, a, cast, iron, cylinder, fitted, with, a, plunger, supporting, a, very, heavy, weight, the, plunger, would, slowly, be, raised, drawing, in, water, until, the, downward, force, of, the, weight, was, sufficient, to, force, the, water, below, it, into, pipes, at, great, pressure, this, invention, allowed, much, larger, quantities, of, water, to, be, forced, through, pipes, at, a, constant, pressure, thus, increasing, the, crane, s, load, capacity, considerably, one, of, his, cranes, commissioned, by, the, italian, navy, in, 1883, and, in, use, until, the, mid, 1950s, is, still, standing, in, venice, where, it, is, now, in, a, state, of, disrepair, there, are, three, major, considerations, in, the, design, of, cranes, first, the, crane, must, be, able, to, lift, the, weight, of, the, load, second, the, crane, must, not, topple, third, the, crane, must, not, rupture, for, stability, the, sum, of, all, moments, about, the, base, of, the, crane, must, be, close, to, zero, so, that, the, crane, does, not, overturn, in, practice, the, magnitude, of, load, that, is, permitted, to, be, lifted, called, the, rated, load, in, the, us, is, some, value, less, than, the, load, that, will, cause, the, crane, to, tip, thus, providing, a, safety, margin, under, united, states, standards, for, mobile, cranes, the, stability, limited, rated, load, for, a, crawler, crane, is, 75, of, the, tipping, load, the, stability, limited, rated, load, for, a, mobile, crane, supported, on, outriggers, is, 85, of, the, tipping, load, these, requirements, along, with, additional, safety, related, aspects, of, crane, design, are, established, by, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, in, the, volume, asme, b30, 5, 2018, mobile, and, locomotive, cranes, standards, for, cranes, mounted, on, ships, or, offshore, platforms, are, somewhat, stricter, because, of, the, dynamic, load, on, the, crane, due, to, vessel, motion, additionally, the, stability, of, the, vessel, or, platform, must, be, considered, for, stationary, pedestal, or, kingpost, mounted, cranes, the, moment, produced, by, the, boom, jib, and, load, is, resisted, by, the, pedestal, base, or, kingpost, stress, within, the, base, must, be, less, than, the, yield, stress, of, the, material, or, the, crane, will, fail, the, crane, types, outlined, in, this, section, are, categorized, based, on, their, primary, area, of, application, the, most, basic, truck, mounted, crane, configuration, is, a, boom, truck, or, lorry, loader, which, features, a, rear, mounted, rotating, telescopic, boom, crane, mounted, on, a, commercial, truck, chassis, larger, heavier, duty, purpose, built, truck, mounted, cranes, are, constructed, in, two, parts, the, carrier, often, called, the, lower, and, the, lifting, component, which, includes, the, boom, called, the, upper, these, are, mated, together, through, a, turntable, allowing, the, upper, to, swing, from, side, to, side, these, modern, hydraulic, truck, cranes, are, usually, single, engine, machines, with, the, same, engine, powering, the, undercarriage, and, the, crane, the, upper, is, usually, powered, via, hydraulics, run, through, the, turntable, from, the, pump, mounted, on, the, lower, in, older, model, designs, of, hydraulic, truck, cranes, there, were, two, engines, one, in, the, lower, pulled, the, crane, down, the, road, and, ran, a, hydraulic, pump, for, the, outriggers, and, jacks, the, one, in, the, upper, ran, the, upper, through, a, hydraulic, pump, of, its, own, many, older, operators, favor, the, two, engine, system, due, to, leaking, seals, in, the, turntable, of, aging, newer, design, cranes, hiab, invented, the, world, s, first, hydraulic, truck, mounted, crane, in, 1947, the, name, hiab, comes, from, the, commonly, used, abbreviation, of, hydrauliska, industri, ab, a, company, founded, in, hudiksvall, sweden, 1944, by, eric, sundin, a, ski, manufacturer, who, saw, a, way, to, utilize, a, truck, s, engine, to, power, loader, cranes, through, the, use, of, hydraulics, generally, these, cranes, are, able, to, travel, on, highways, eliminating, the, need, for, special, equipment, to, transport, the, crane, unless, weight, or, other, size, constrictions, are, in, place, such, as, local, laws, if, this, is, the, case, most, larger, cranes, are, equipped, with, either, special, trailers, to, help, spread, the, load, over, more, axles, or, are, able, to, disassemble, to, meet, requirements, an, example, is, counterweights, often, a, crane, will, be, followed, by, another, truck, hauling, the, counterweights, that, are, removed, for, travel, in, addition, some, cranes, are, able, to, remove, the, entire, upper, however, this, is, usually, only, an, issue, in, a, large, crane, and, mostly, done, with, a, conventional, crane, such, as, a, link, belt, hc, 238, when, working, on, the, job, site, outriggers, are, extended, horizontally, from, the, chassis, then, vertically, to, level, and, stabilize, the, crane, while, stationary, and, hoisting, many, truck, cranes, have, slow, travelling, capability, a, few, miles, per, hour, while, suspending, a, load, great, care, must, be, taken, not, to, swing, the, load, sideways, from, the, direction, of, travel, as, most, anti, tipping, stability, then, lies, in, the, stiffness, of, the, chassis, suspension, most, cranes, of, this, type, also, have, moving, counterweights, for, stabilization, beyond, that, provided, by, the, outriggers, loads, suspended, directly, aft, are, the, most, stable, since, most, of, the, weight, of, the, crane, acts, as, a, counterweight, factory, calculated, charts, or, electronic, safeguards, are, used, by, crane, operators, to, determine, the, maximum, safe, loads, for, stationary, outriggered, work, as, well, as, on, rubber, loads, and, travelling, speeds, truck, cranes, range, in, lifting, capacity, from, about, 14, 5, short, tons, 12, 9, long, tons, 13, 2, t, to, about, 2, 240, short, tons, 2, 000, long, tons, 2, 032, t, although, most, only, rotate, about, 180, degrees, the, more, expensive, truck, mounted, cranes, can, turn, a, full, 360, degrees, a, loader, crane, also, called, a, knuckle, boom, crane, or, articulating, crane, is, an, hydraulically, powered, articulated, arm, fitted, to, a, truck, or, trailer, and, is, used, for, loading, unloading, the, vehicle, cargo, the, numerous, jointed, sections, can, be, folded, into, a, small, space, when, the, crane, is, not, in, use, one, or, more, of, the, sections, may, be, telescopic, often, the, crane, will, have, a, degree, of, automation, and, be, able, to, unload, or, stow, itself, without, an, operator, s, instruction, unlike, most, cranes, the, operator, must, move, around, the, vehicle, to, be, able, to, view, his, load, hence, modern, cranes, may, be, fitted, with, a, portable, cabled, or, radio, linked, control, system, to, supplement, the, crane, mounted, hydraulic, control, levers, in, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, this, type, of, crane, is, often, known, colloquially, as, a, hiab, partly, because, this, manufacturer, invented, the, loader, crane, and, was, first, into, the, uk, market, and, partly, because, the, distinctive, name, was, displayed, prominently, on, the, boom, arm, a, rolloader, crane, is, a, loader, crane, mounted, on, a, chassis, with, wheels, this, chassis, can, ride, on, the, trailer, because, the, crane, can, move, on, the, trailer, it, can, be, a, light, crane, so, the, trailer, is, allowed, to, transport, more, goods, a, telescopic, crane, has, a, boom, that, consists, of, a, number, of, tubes, fitted, one, inside, the, other, a, hydraulic, cylinder, or, other, powered, mechanism, extends, or, retracts, the, tubes, to, increase, or, decrease, the, total, length, of, the, boom, these, types, of, booms, are, often, used, for, short, term, construction, projects, rescue, jobs, lifting, boats, in, and, out, of, the, water, etc, the, relative, compactness, of, telescopic, booms, makes, them, adaptable, for, many, mobile, applications, though, not, all, telescopic, cranes, are, mobile, cranes, many, of, them, are, truck, mounted, a, telescopic, tower, crane, has, a, telescopic, mast, and, often, a, superstructure, jib, on, top, so, that, it, functions, as, a, tower, crane, some, telescopic, tower, cranes, also, have, a, telescopic, jib, a, rough, terrain, crane, has, a, boom, mounted, on, an, undercarriage, atop, four, rubber, tires, that, is, designed, for, off, road, pick, and, carry, operations, outriggers, are, used, to, level, and, stabilize, the, crane, for, hoisting, these, telescopic, cranes, are, single, engine, machines, with, the, same, engine, powering, the, undercarriage, and, the, crane, similar, to, a, crawler, crane, the, engine, is, usually, mounted, in, the, undercarriage, rather, than, in, the, upper, as, with, crawler, crane, most, have, 4, wheel, drive, and, 4, wheel, steering, for, traversing, tighter, and, slicker, terrain, than, a, standard, truck, crane, with, less, site, prep, an, all, terrain, crane, is, a, hybrid, combining, the, roadability, of, a, truck, mounted, and, on, site, maneuverability, of, a, rough, terrain, crane, it, can, both, travel, at, speed, on, public, roads, and, maneuver, on, rough, terrain, at, the, job, site, using, all, wheel, and, crab, steering, at, s, have, 2, 12, axles, and, are, designed, for, lifting, loads, up, to, 2, 000, tonnes, 2, 205, short, tons, 1, 968, long, tons, a, crawler, crane, has, its, boom, mounted, on, an, undercarriage, fitted, with, a, set, of, crawler, tracks, that, provide, both, stability, and, mobility, crawler, cranes, range, in, lifting, capacity, from, about, 40, to, 4, 000, long, tons, 44, 8, to, 4, 480, 0, short, tons, 40, 6, to, 4, 064, 2, t, as, seen, from, the, xgc88000, crawler, crane, the, main, advantage, of, a, crawler, crane, is, its, ready, mobility, and, use, since, the, crane, is, able, to, operate, on, sites, with, minimal, improvement, and, stable, on, its, tracks, without, outriggers, wide, tracks, spread, the, weight, out, over, a, great, area, and, are, far, better, than, wheels, at, traversing, soft, ground, without, sinking, in, a, crawler, crane, is, also, capable, of, traveling, with, a, load, its, main, disadvantage, is, its, weight, making, it, difficult, and, expensive, to, transport, typically, a, large, crawler, must, be, disassembled, at, least, into, boom, and, cab, and, moved, by, trucks, rail, cars, or, ships, to, its, next, location, a, pick, and, carry, crane, is, similar, to, a, mobile, crane, in, that, is, designed, to, travel, on, public, roads, however, pick, and, carry, cranes, have, no, stabiliser, legs, or, outriggers, and, are, designed, to, lift, the, load, and, carry, it, to, its, destination, within, a, small, radius, then, be, able, to, drive, to, the, next, job, pick, and, carry, cranes, are, popular, in, australia, where, large, distances, are, encountered, between, job, sites, one, popular, manufacturer, in, australia, was, franna, who, have, since, been, bought, by, terex, and, now, all, pick, and, carry, cranes, are, commonly, called, frannas, even, though, they, may, be, made, by, other, manufacturers, nearly, every, medium, and, large, sized, crane, company, in, australia, has, at, least, one, and, many, companies, have, fleets, of, these, cranes, the, capacity, range, is, between, 10, and, 40, t, 9, 8, and, 39, 4, long, tons, 11, and, 44, short, tons, as, a, maximum, lift, although, this, is, much, less, as, the, load, gets, further, from, the, front, of, the, crane, pick, and, carry, cranes, have, displaced, the, work, usually, completed, by, smaller, truck, cranes, as, the, set, up, time, is, much, quicker, many, steel, fabrication, yards, also, use, pick, and, carry, cranes, as, they, can, walk, with, fabricated, steel, sections, and, place, these, where, required, with, relative, ease, a, carry, deck, crane, is, a, small, 4, wheel, crane, with, a, 360, degree, rotating, boom, placed, right, in, the, centre, and, an, operators, cab, located, at, one, end, under, this, boom, the, rear, section, houses, the, engine, and, the, area, above, the, wheels, is, a, flat, deck, very, much, an, american, invention, the, carry, deck, can, hoist, a, load, in, a, confined, space, and, then, load, it, on, the, deck, space, around, the, cab, or, engine, and, subsequently, move, to, another, site, the, carry, deck, principle, is, the, american, version, of, the, pick, and, carry, crane, and, both, allow, the, load, to, be, moved, by, the, crane, over, short, distances, telescopic, handlers, are, forklift, like, trucks, that, have, a, set, of, forks, mounted, on, a, telescoping, extendable, boom, like, a, crane, early, telescopic, handlers, only, lifted, in, one, direction, and, did, not, rotate, however, several, of, the, manufacturers, have, designed, telescopic, handlers, that, rotate, 360, degrees, through, a, turntable, and, these, machines, look, almost, identical, to, the, rough, terrain, crane, these, new, 360, degree, telescopic, handler, crane, models, have, outriggers, or, stabiliser, legs, that, must, be, lowered, before, lifting, however, their, design, has, been, simplified, so, that, they, can, be, more, quickly, deployed, these, machines, are, often, used, to, handle, pallets, of, bricks, and, install, frame, trusses, on, many, new, building, sites, and, they, have, eroded, much, of, the, work, for, small, telescopic, truck, cranes, many, of, the, world, s, armed, forces, have, purchased, telescopic, handlers, and, some, of, these, are, the, much, more, expensive, fully, rotating, types, their, off, road, capability, and, their, on, site, versatility, to, unload, pallets, using, forks, or, lift, like, a, crane, make, them, a, valuable, piece, of, machinery, a, block, setting, crane, is, a, form, of, crane, they, were, used, for, installing, the, large, stone, blocks, used, to, build, breakwaters, moles, and, stone, piers, tower, cranes, are, a, modern, form, of, balance, crane, that, consist, of, the, same, basic, parts, fixed, to, the, ground, on, a, concrete, slab, and, sometimes, attached, to, the, sides, of, structures, tower, cranes, often, give, the, best, combination, of, height, and, lifting, capacity, and, are, used, in, the, construction, of, tall, buildings, the, base, is, then, attached, to, the, mast, which, gives, the, crane, its, height, further, the, mast, is, attached, to, the, slewing, unit, gear, and, motor, that, allows, the, crane, to, rotate, on, top, of, the, slewing, unit, there, are, three, main, parts, which, are, the, long, horizontal, jib, working, arm, shorter, counter, jib, and, the, operator, s, cab, optimization, of, tower, crane, location, in, the, construction, sites, has, an, important, effect, on, material, transportation, costs, of, a, project, the, long, horizontal, jib, is, the, part, of, the, crane, that, carries, the, load, the, counter, jib, carries, a, counterweight, usually, of, concrete, blocks, while, the, jib, suspends, the, load, to, and, from, the, center, of, the, crane, the, crane, operator, either, sits, in, a, cab, at, the, top, of, the, tower, or, controls, the, crane, by, radio, remote, control, from, the, ground, in, the, first, case, the, operator, s, cab, is, most, usually, located, at, the, top, of, the, tower, attached, to, the, turntable, but, can, be, mounted, on, the, jib, or, partway, down, the, tower, the, lifting, hook, is, operated, by, the, crane, operator, using, electric, motors, to, manipulate, wire, rope, cables, through, a, system, of, sheaves, the, hook, is, located, on, the, long, horizontal, arm, to, lift, the, load, which, also, contains, its, motor, in, order, to, hook, and, unhook, the, loads, the, operator, usually, works, in, conjunction, with, a, signaller, known, as, a, dogger, rigger, or, swamper, they, are, most, often, in, radio, contact, and, always, use, hand, signals, the, rigger, or, dogger, directs, the, schedule, of, lifts, for, the, crane, and, is, responsible, for, the, safety, of, the, rigging, and, loads, tower, cranes, can, achieve, a, height, under, hook, of, over, 100, metres, tower, cranes, are, used, extensively, in, construction, and, other, industry, to, hoist, and, move, materials, there, are, many, types, of, tower, cranes, although, they, are, different, in, type, the, main, parts, are, the, same, as, follows, a, tower, crane, is, usually, assembled, by, a, telescopic, jib, mobile, crane, of, greater, reach, also, see, self, erecting, crane, below, and, in, the, case, of, tower, cranes, that, have, risen, while, constructing, very, tall, skyscrapers, a, smaller, crane, or, derrick, will, often, be, lifted, to, the, roof, of, the, completed, tower, to, dismantle, the, tower, crane, afterwards, which, may, be, more, difficult, than, the, installation, tower, cranes, can, be, operated, by, remote, control, removing, the, need, for, the, crane, operator, to, sit, in, a, cab, atop, the, crane, each, model, and, distinctive, style, of, tower, crane, has, a, predetermined, lifting, chart, that, can, be, applied, to, any, radii, available, depending, on, its, configuration, similar, to, a, mobile, crane, a, tower, crane, may, lift, an, object, of, far, greater, mass, closer, to, its, center, of, rotation, than, at, its, maximum, radius, an, operator, manipulates, several, levers, and, pedals, to, control, each, function, of, the, crane, when, a, tower, crane, is, used, in, proximity, to, buildings, roads, power, lines, or, other, tower, cranes, a, tower, crane, anti, collision, system, is, used, this, operator, support, system, reduces, the, risk, of, a, dangerous, interaction, occurring, between, a, tower, crane, and, another, structure, in, some, countries, such, as, france, tower, crane, anti, collision, systems, are, mandatory, generally, a, type, of, pedestrian, operated, tower, crane, self, erecting, tower, cranes, are, transported, as, a, single, unit, and, can, be, assembled, by, a, qualified, technician, without, the, assistance, of, a, larger, mobile, crane, they, are, bottom, slewing, cranes, that, stand, on, outriggers, have, no, counter, jib, have, their, counterweights, and, ballast, at, the, base, of, the, mast, cannot, climb, themselves, have, a, reduced, capacity, compared, to, standard, tower, cranes, and, seldom, have, an, operator, s, cabin, in, some, cases, smaller, self, erecting, tower, cranes, may, have, axles, permanently, fitted, to, the, tower, section, to, make, maneuvering, the, crane, onsite, easier, tower, cranes, can, also, use, a, hydraulic, powered, jack, frame, to, raise, themselves, to, add, new, tower, sections, without, any, additional, other, cranes, assisting, beyond, the, initial, assembly, stage, this, is, how, it, can, grow, to, nearly, any, height, needed, to, build, the, tallest, skyscrapers, when, tied, to, a, building, as, the, building, rises, the, maximum, unsupported, height, of, a, tower, crane, is, around, 265, ft, for, a, video, of, a, crane, getting, taller, see, crane, building, itself, on, youtube, for, another, animation, of, such, a, crane, in, use, see, sas, tower, construction, simulation, on, youtube, here, the, crane, is, used, to, erect, a, scaffold, which, in, turn, contains, a, gantry, to, lift, sections, of, a, bridge, spire, many, tower, cranes, are, designed, to, jump, in, stages, effectively, lifting, themselves, to, the, next, level, a, specialty, example, of, a, climbing, crane, was, introduced, by, lagerwey, wind, and, enercon, to, construct, a, wind, turbine, tower, where, instead, of, erecting, a, large, crane, a, smaller, climbing, crane, can, raise, itself, with, the, structure, s, construction, lift, the, generator, housing, to, its, top, add, the, rotor, blades, then, climb, down, a, reach, stacker, is, a, vehicle, used, for, handling, intermodal, cargo, containers, in, small, terminals, or, medium, sized, ports, reach, stackers, are, able, to, transport, a, container, short, distances, very, quickly, and, pile, them, in, various, rows, depending, on, its, access, a, sidelifter, crane, is, a, road, going, truck, or, semi, trailer, able, to, hoist, and, transport, iso, standard, containers, container, lift, is, done, with, parallel, crane, like, hoists, which, can, lift, a, container, from, the, ground, or, from, a, railway, vehicle, a, travel, lift, also, called, a, boat, gantry, crane, or, boat, crane, is, a, crane, with, two, rectangular, side, panels, joined, by, a, single, spanning, beam, at, the, top, of, one, end, the, crane, is, mobile, with, four, groups, of, steerable, wheels, one, on, each, corner, these, cranes, allow, boats, with, masts, or, tall, super, structures, to, be, removed, from, the, water, and, transported, around, docks, or, marinas, not, to, be, confused, mechanical, device, used, for, transferring, a, vessel, between, two, levels, of, water, which, is, also, called, a, boat, lift, a, straddle, carrier, moves, and, stacks, intermodal, containers, ring, cranes, are, some, of, the, largest, and, heaviest, land, based, cranes, ever, designed, a, ring, shaped, track, support, the, main, superstructure, allowing, for, extremely, heavy, loads, up, to, thousands, of, tonnes, the, hammerhead, or, giant, cantilever, crane, is, a, fixed, jib, crane, consisting, of, a, steel, braced, tower, on, which, revolves, a, large, horizontal, double, cantilever, the, forward, part, of, this, cantilever, or, jib, carries, the, lifting, trolley, the, jib, is, extended, backwards, in, order, to, form, a, support, for, the, machinery, and, counterbalancing, weight, in, addition, to, the, motions, of, lifting, and, revolving, there, is, provided, a, so, called, racking, motion, by, which, the, lifting, trolley, with, the, load, suspended, can, be, moved, in, and, out, along, the, jib, without, altering, the, level, of, the, load, such, horizontal, movement, of, the, load, is, a, marked, feature, of, later, crane, design, these, cranes, are, generally, constructed, in, large, sizes, and, can, lift, up, to, 350, tons, the, design, of, hammerkran, evolved, first, in, germany, around, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, and, was, adopted, and, developed, for, use, in, british, shipyards, to, support, the, battleship, construction, program, from, 1904, to, 1914, the, ability, of, the, hammerhead, crane, to, lift, heavy, weights, was, useful, for, installing, large, pieces, of, battleships, such, as, armour, plate, and, gun, barrels, giant, cantilever, cranes, were, also, installed, in, naval, shipyards, in, japan, and, in, the, united, states, the, british, government, also, installed, a, giant, cantilever, crane, at, the, singapore, naval, base, 1938, and, later, a, copy, of, the, crane, was, installed, at, garden, island, naval, dockyard, in, sydney, 1951, these, cranes, provided, repair, support, for, the, battle, fleet, operating, far, from, great, britain, in, the, british, empire, the, engineering, firm, sir, william, arrol, co, was, the, principal, manufacturer, of, giant, cantilever, cranes, the, company, built, a, total, of, fourteen, among, the, sixty, built, in, the, world, few, remain, seven, in, england, and, scotland, of, about, fifteen, worldwide, the, titan, clydebank, is, one, of, the, four, scottish, cranes, on, the, river, clyde, and, preserved, as, a, tourist, attraction, normally, a, crane, with, a, hinged, jib, will, tend, to, have, its, hook, also, move, up, and, down, as, the, jib, moves, or, luffs, a, level, luffing, crane, is, a, crane, of, this, common, design, but, with, an, extra, mechanism, to, keep, the, hook, at, the, same, level, when, the, jib, is, pivoted, in, or, out, an, overhead, crane, also, known, as, a, bridge, crane, is, a, type, of, crane, where, the, hook, and, line, mechanism, runs, along, a, horizontal, beam, that, itself, runs, along, two, widely, separated, rails, often, it, is, in, a, long, factory, building, and, runs, along, rails, along, the, building, s, two, long, walls, it, is, similar, to, a, gantry, crane, overhead, cranes, typically, consist, of, either, a, single, beam, or, a, double, beam, construction, these, can, be, built, using, typical, steel, beams, or, a, more, complex, box, girder, type, pictured, on, the, right, is, a, single, bridge, box, girder, crane, with, the, hoist, and, system, operated, with, a, control, pendant, double, girder, bridge, are, more, typical, when, needing, heavier, capacity, systems, from, 10, tons, and, above, the, advantage, of, the, box, girder, type, configuration, results, in, a, system, that, has, a, lower, deadweight, yet, a, stronger, overall, system, integrity, also, included, would, be, a, hoist, to, lift, the, items, the, bridge, which, spans, the, area, covered, by, the, crane, and, a, trolley, to, move, along, the, bridge, the, most, common, overhead, crane, use, is, in, the, steel, industry, at, every, step, of, the, manufacturing, process, until, it, leaves, a, factory, as, a, finished, product, steel, is, handled, by, an, overhead, crane, raw, materials, are, poured, into, a, furnace, by, crane, hot, steel, is, stored, for, cooling, by, an, overhead, crane, the, finished, coils, are, lifted, and, loaded, onto, trucks, and, trains, by, overhead, crane, and, the, fabricator, or, stamper, uses, an, overhead, crane, to, handle, the, steel, in, his, factory, the, automobile, industry, uses, overhead, cranes, for, handling, of, raw, materials, smaller, workstation, cranes, handle, lighter, loads, in, a, work, area, such, as, cnc, mill, or, saw, almost, all, paper, mills, use, bridge, cranes, for, regular, maintenance, requiring, removal, of, heavy, press, rolls, and, other, equipment, the, bridge, cranes, are, used, in, the, initial, construction, of, paper, machines, because, they, facilitate, installation, of, the, heavy, cast, iron, paper, drying, drums, and, other, massive, equipment, some, weighing, as, much, as, 70, tons, in, many, instances, the, cost, of, a, bridge, crane, can, be, largely, offset, with, savings, from, not, renting, mobile, cranes, in, the, construction, of, a, facility, that, uses, a, lot, of, heavy, process, equipment, this, electric, overhead, traveling, crane, is, most, common, type, of, overhead, crane, found, in, many, factories, these, cranes, are, electrically, operated, by, a, control, pendant, radio, ir, remote, pendant, or, from, an, operator, cabin, attached, to, the, crane, a, gantry, crane, has, a, hoist, in, a, fixed, machinery, house, or, on, a, trolley, that, runs, horizontally, along, rails, usually, fitted, on, a, single, beam, mono, girder, or, two, beams, twin, girder, the, crane, frame, is, supported, on, a, gantry, system, with, equalized, beams, and, wheels, that, run, on, the, gantry, rail, usually, perpendicular, to, the, trolley, travel, direction, these, cranes, come, in, all, sizes, and, some, can, move, very, heavy, loads, particularly, the, extremely, large, examples, used, in, shipyards, or, industrial, installations, a, special, version, is, the, container, crane, or, portainer, crane, named, by, the, first, manufacturer, designed, for, loading, and, unloading, ship, borne, containers, at, a, port, most, container, cranes, are, of, this, type, a, jib, crane, is, a, type, of, crane, not, to, be, confused, with, a, crane, rigged, with, a, jib, to, extend, its, main, boom, where, a, horizontal, member, jib, or, boom, supporting, a, moveable, hoist, is, fixed, to, a, wall, or, to, a, floor, mounted, pillar, jib, cranes, are, used, in, industrial, premises, and, on, military, vehicles, the, jib, may, swing, through, an, arc, to, give, additional, lateral, movement, or, be, fixed, similar, cranes, often, known, simply, as, hoists, were, fitted, on, the, top, floor, of, warehouse, buildings, to, enable, goods, to, be, lifted, to, all, floors, bulk, handling, cranes, are,
