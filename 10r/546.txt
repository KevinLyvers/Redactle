a, mortar, today, is, usually, a, simple, lightweight, man, portable, muzzle, loaded, cannon, consisting, of, a, smooth, bore, although, some, models, use, a, rifled, barrel, metal, tube, fixed, to, a, base, plate, to, spread, out, the, recoil, with, a, lightweight, bipod, mount, and, a, sight, mortars, are, typically, used, as, indirect, fire, weapons, for, close, fire, support, with, a, variety, of, ammunition, historically, mortars, were, heavy, siege, artillery, mortars, launch, explosive, shells, technically, called, bombs, in, high, arching, ballistic, trajectories, mortars, have, been, used, for, hundreds, of, years, the, earliest, reported, use, of, mortars, was, in, korea, in, a, 1413, naval, battle, when, korean, gunsmiths, developed, the, wan, gu, gourd, shaped, mortar, the, earliest, version, of, the, wan, gu, dates, back, to, 1407, ch, oe, hae, san, 1380, 1443, the, son, of, ch, oe, mu, s, n, 1325, 1395, is, generally, credited, with, inventing, the, wan, gu, in, the, ming, dynasty, general, qi, jiguang, recorded, the, use, of, a, mini, cannon, called, the, hu, dun, pao, that, was, similar, to, the, mortar, the, first, use, in, siege, warfare, was, at, the, 1453, siege, of, constantinople, by, mehmed, the, conqueror, an, italian, account, of, the, 1456, siege, of, belgrade, by, giovanni, da, tagliacozzo, states, that, the, ottoman, turks, used, seven, mortars, that, fired, stone, shots, one, italian, mile, high, the, time, of, flight, of, these, was, apparently, long, enough, that, casualties, could, be, avoided, by, posting, observers, to, give, warning, of, their, trajectories, early, mortars, such, as, the, pumhart, von, steyr, were, large, and, heavy, and, could, not, be, easily, transported, simply, made, these, weapons, were, no, more, than, iron, bowls, reminiscent, of, the, kitchen, and, apothecary, mortars, whence, they, drew, their, name, an, early, transportable, mortar, was, invented, by, baron, menno, van, coehoorn, in, 1701, this, mortar, fired, an, exploding, shell, which, had, a, fuse, that, was, lit, by, the, hot, gases, when, fired, the, coehorn, mortar, gained, quick, popularity, necessitating, a, new, form, of, naval, ship, the, bomb, vessel, mortars, played, a, significant, role, in, the, venetian, conquest, of, morea, and, in, the, course, of, this, campaign, an, ammunition, depot, in, the, parthenon, was, blown, up, an, early, use, of, these, more, mobile, mortars, as, field, artillery, rather, than, siege, artillery, was, by, british, forces, in, the, suppression, of, the, jacobite, rising, of, 1719, at, the, battle, of, glen, shiel, high, angle, trajectory, mortars, held, a, great, advantage, over, standard, field, guns, in, the, rough, terrain, of, the, west, highlands, of, scotland, the, mortar, had, fallen, out, of, general, use, in, europe, by, the, napoleonic, era, although, manby, mortars, were, widely, used, on, the, coast, to, launch, lines, to, ships, in, distress, and, interest, in, their, use, as, a, weapon, was, not, revived, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, mortars, were, heavily, used, by, both, sides, during, the, american, civil, war, at, the, siege, of, vicksburg, general, ulysses, s, grant, reported, making, mortars, by, taking, logs, of, the, toughest, wood, that, could, be, found, boring, them, out, for, 6, or, 12, lb, 2, 7, or, 5, 4, kg, shells, and, binding, them, with, strong, iron, bands, these, answered, as, coehorns, and, shells, were, successfully, thrown, from, them, into, the, trenches, of, the, enemy, during, the, russo, japanese, war, lieutenant, general, leonid, gobyato, of, the, imperial, russian, army, applied, the, principles, of, indirect, fire, from, closed, firing, positions, in, the, field, and, with, the, collaboration, of, general, roman, kondratenko, he, designed, the, first, mortar, that, fired, navy, shells, the, german, army, studied, the, siege, of, port, arthur, where, heavy, artillery, had, been, unable, to, destroy, defensive, structures, like, barbed, wire, and, bunkers, consequently, they, developed, a, short, barrelled, rifled, muzzle, loading, mortar, called, the, minenwerfer, heavily, used, during, world, war, i, they, were, made, in, three, sizes, 7, 58, cm, 2, 98, in, 17, cm, 6, 7, in, and, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, it, was, not, until, the, stokes, mortar, was, devised, by, sir, wilfred, stokes, in, 1915, during, the, first, world, war, that, the, modern, mortar, transportable, by, one, person, was, born, in, the, conditions, of, trench, warfare, there, was, a, great, need, for, a, versatile, and, easily, portable, weapon, that, could, be, manned, by, troops, under, cover, in, the, trenches, stokes, design, was, initially, rejected, in, june, 1915, because, it, was, unable, to, use, existing, stocks, of, british, mortar, ammunition, and, it, took, the, intervention, of, david, lloyd, george, at, that, time, minister, of, munitions, and, lieutenant, colonel, j, c, matheson, of, the, trench, warfare, supply, department, who, reported, to, lloyd, george, to, expedite, manufacture, of, the, stokes, mortar, the, weapon, proved, to, be, extremely, useful, in, the, muddy, trenches, of, the, western, front, as, a, mortar, round, could, be, aimed, to, fall, directly, into, trenches, where, artillery, shells, because, of, their, low, angle, of, flight, could, not, possibly, go, the, stokes, mortar, was, a, simple, muzzle, loaded, weapon, consisting, of, a, smoothbore, metal, tube, fixed, to, a, base, plate, to, absorb, recoil, with, a, lightweight, bipod, mount, when, a, mortar, bomb, was, dropped, into, the, tube, an, impact, sensitive, primer, in, the, base, of, the, bomb, would, make, contact, with, a, firing, pin, at, the, base, of, the, tube, and, detonate, firing, the, bomb, towards, the, target, the, stokes, mortar, could, fire, as, many, as, 25, bombs, per, minute, and, had, a, maximum, range, of, 800, yd, 730, m, firing, the, original, cylindrical, unstabilised, projectile, a, modified, version, of, the, mortar, which, fired, a, modern, fin, stabilised, streamlined, projectile, and, had, a, booster, charge, for, longer, range, was, developed, after, world, war, i, this, was, in, effect, a, new, weapon, by, world, war, ii, it, could, fire, as, many, as, 30, bombs, per, minute, and, had, a, range, of, over, 2, 500, yd, 2, 300, m, with, some, shell, types, the, french, developed, an, improved, version, of, the, stokes, mortar, as, the, brandt, mle, 27, further, refined, as, the, brandt, mle, 31, this, design, was, widely, copied, with, and, without, license, these, weapons, were, the, prototypes, for, all, subsequent, light, mortar, developments, around, the, world, mortar, carriers, are, vehicles, which, carry, a, mortar, as, a, primary, weapon, numerous, vehicles, have, been, used, to, mount, mortars, from, improvised, civilian, trucks, used, by, insurgents, to, modified, infantry, fighting, vehicles, such, as, variants, of, the, m3, half, track, and, m113, armored, personnel, carrier, to, vehicles, specifically, intended, to, carry, a, mortar, simpler, vehicles, carry, a, standard, infantry, mortar, while, in, more, complex, vehicles, the, mortar, is, fully, integrated, into, the, vehicle, and, cannot, be, dismounted, from, the, vehicle, mortar, carriers, cannot, be, fired, while, on, the, move, and, some, must, be, dismounted, to, fire, there, are, numerous, armoured, fighting, vehicles, and, even, main, battle, tanks, that, can, be, equipped, with, a, mortar, either, outside, or, inside, of, the, cabin, the, israeli, merkava, tank, uses, a, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, mortar, as, a, secondary, armament, the, russian, army, uses, the, 2s4, tyulpan, self, propelled, 240, mm, 9, 4, in, heavy, mortar, which, is, one, of, the, largest, mortars, in, current, use, gun, mortars, are, breech, loaded, mortars, usually, equipped, with, a, hydraulic, recoil, mechanism, and, sometimes, equipped, with, an, autoloader, they, are, usually, mounted, on, an, armoured, vehicle, and, are, capable, of, both, direct, fire, and, indirect, fire, the, archetypes, are, the, brandt, mle, cm60a1, and, brandt, 60, mm, lr, which, combine, features, of, modern, infantry, mortars, together, with, those, of, modern, cannon, such, weapons, are, most, commonly, smoothbore, firing, fin, stabilised, rounds, using, relatively, small, propellant, charges, in, comparison, to, projectile, weight, while, some, have, been, fitted, with, rifled, barrels, such, as, the, 2s31, vena, and, 2s9, nona, they, have, short, barrels, in, comparison, to, guns, and, are, much, more, lightly, built, than, guns, of, a, similar, calibre, all, characteristics, of, infantry, mortars, this, produces, a, hybrid, weapon, capable, of, engaging, area, targets, with, indirect, high, angle, fire, and, also, specific, targets, such, as, vehicles, and, bunkers, with, direct, fire, such, hybrids, are, much, heavier, and, more, complicated, than, infantry, mortars, superior, to, rocket, propelled, grenades, in, the, anti, armour, and, bunker, busting, role, but, have, a, reduced, range, compared, to, modern, gun, howitzers, and, inferior, anti, tank, capability, compared, to, modern, anti, tank, guided, weapons, however, they, do, have, a, niche, in, for, example, providing, a, multi, role, anti, personnel, anti, armour, capability, in, light, mobile, formations, such, systems, like, the, soviet, 120, mm, 2s9, nona, are, mostly, self, propelled, although, a, towed, variant, exists, the, amos, advanced, mortar, system, is, an, example, of, an, even, more, advanced, gun, mortar, system, it, uses, a, 120, mm, automatic, twin, barrelled, breech, loaded, mortar, turret, which, can, be, mounted, on, a, variety, of, armoured, vehicles, and, attack, boats, a, modern, example, of, a, gun, mortar, is, the, 2b9, vasilek, a, spigot, mortar, consists, mainly, of, a, solid, rod, or, spigot, onto, which, a, hollow, tube, in, the, projectile, fits, inverting, the, normal, tube, mortar, arrangement, at, the, top, of, the, tube, in, the, projectile, a, cavity, contains, propellant, such, as, cordite, there, is, usually, a, trigger, mechanism, built, into, the, base, of, the, spigot, with, a, long, firing, pin, running, up, the, length, of, the, spigot, activating, a, primer, inside, the, projectile, and, firing, the, propellant, charge, the, advantage, of, a, spigot, mortar, is, that, the, firing, unit, baseplate, and, spigot, is, smaller, and, lighter, than, a, conventional, tube, mortar, of, equivalent, payload, and, range, it, is, also, somewhat, simpler, to, manufacture, further, most, spigot, mortars, have, no, barrel, in, the, conventional, sense, which, means, ammunition, of, almost, any, weight, and, diameter, can, be, fired, from, the, same, mortar, the, disadvantage, is, that, while, most, mortar, bombs, have, a, streamlined, shape, towards, the, back, that, fits, a, spigot, mortar, application, well, using, that, space, for, the, spigot, mortar, tube, takes, volume, and, mass, away, from, the, payload, of, the, projectile, if, a, soldier, is, carrying, only, a, few, projectiles, the, projectile, weight, disadvantage, is, not, significant, however, the, weight, of, a, large, quantity, of, the, heavier, and, more, complex, spigot, projectiles, offsets, the, weight, saved, a, near, silent, mortar, can, operate, using, the, spigot, principle, each, round, has, a, close, fitting, sliding, plug, in, the, tube, that, fits, over, the, spigot, when, the, round, is, fired, the, projectile, is, pushed, off, the, spigot, but, before, the, plug, clears, the, spigot, it, is, caught, by, a, constriction, at, the, base, of, the, tube, this, traps, the, gases, from, the, propelling, charge, and, hence, the, sound, of, the, firing, after, world, war, ii, the, belgium, fly, k, silent, spigot, mortar, was, accepted, into, french, service, as, the, tn, 8111, spigot, mortars, generally, fell, out, of, favour, after, world, war, ii, and, were, replaced, by, smaller, conventional, mortars, military, applications, of, spigot, mortars, include, non, military, applications, include, the, use, of, small, calibre, spigot, mortars, to, launch, lightweight, low, velocity, foam, dummy, targets, used, for, training, retriever, dogs, for, bird, hunting, simple, launchers, use, a, separate, small, primer, cap, as, the, sole, propellant, similar, or, identical, to, the, cartridges, used, in, industrial, nail, guns, insurgent, groups, often, use, improvised, or, homemade, mortars, to, attack, fortified, military, installations, or, terrorise, civilians, they, are, usually, constructed, from, heavy, steel, piping, mounted, on, a, steel, frame, these, weapons, may, fire, standard, mortar, rounds, purpose, made, shells, repurposed, gas, cylinders, filled, with, explosives, and, shrapnel, or, any, other, type, of, improvised, explosive, incendiary, or, chemical, munitions, these, were, called, barrack, busters, by, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, pira, improvised, mortars, used, by, insurgents, in, the, syrian, civil, war, are, known, as, hell, cannons, observers, have, noted, that, they, are, wildly, inaccurate, and, responsible, for, hundreds, of, civilian, deaths, improvised, mortars, used, in, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, by, the, rebel, tamil, tigers, are, known, as, pasilan, 2000, also, known, as, a, rocket, mortar, or, arti, mortar, like, the, 122, mm, 4, 8, in, cannon, successor, to, the, baba, mortar, used, by, the, ltte, for, ground, operations, since, the, 1980s, as, baba, mortar, rounds, contained, tar, they, caused, a, fire, when, they, hit, the, ground, the, baba, the, prototype, mortar, was, crude, but, with, time, the, weapon, has, improved, the, pasilan, 2000, the, improved, version, has, been, developed, with, characteristics, similar, to, a, rocket, launcher, the, pasilan, 2000, was, a, heavy, mortar, fired, from, a, mobile, launcher, mounted, on, a, tractor, the, shell, does, not, emit, constant, muzzle, flares, like, artillery, or, mbrl, this, is, ideal, for, ltte, s, camouflage, and, conceals, attacking, style, once, a, round, is, fired, forward, observers, spies, civilian, spotters, can, correct, the, fire, the, way, the, tube, is, installed, is, similar, to, the, positioning, of, rocket, pods, the, length, and, calibre, of, the, barrel, indicate, pasilan, 2000, system, has, common, features, to, the, chinese, made, type, 82, 130, mm, 5, 1, in, 30, tube, mlrs, introduced, by, the, palestinian, liberation, army, pla, in, the, early, 1980s, rather, than, rail, guided, katyusha, variants, such, as, the, qassam, rocket, the, warhead, weight, is, 70, kg, 150, lb, and, it, is, filled, with, tnt, it, had, a, range, of, 15, to, 25, km, 9, 3, to, 15, 5, mi, the, rocket, has, since, then, undergone, some, modifications, the, pasilan, 2000, was, more, lethal, than, baba, mortar, but, it, was, not, heavily, used, for, ground, attacks, during, the, eelam, war, iv, most, modern, mortar, systems, consist, of, four, main, components, a, barrel, a, base, plate, a, bipod, and, a, sight, modern, mortars, normally, range, in, calibre, from, 60, mm, 2, 36, in, to, 120, mm, 4, 72, in, however, both, larger, and, smaller, mortars, have, been, produced, the, modern, mortar, is, a, muzzle, loaded, weapon, and, relatively, simple, to, operate, it, consists, of, a, barrel, into, which, the, gunners, drop, a, mortar, round, when, the, round, reaches, the, base, of, the, barrel, it, hits, a, fixed, firing, pin, that, fires, the, round, the, barrel, is, generally, set, at, an, angle, of, between, 45, and, 85, degrees, 800, to, 1500, mils, with, the, higher, angle, producing, a, shorter, horizontal, trajectory, some, mortars, have, a, moving, firing, pin, operated, by, a, lanyard, or, trigger, mechanism, ammunition, for, mortars, generally, comes, in, two, main, varieties, fin, stabilised, and, spin, stabilised, examples, of, the, former, have, short, fins, on, their, posterior, portion, which, control, the, path, of, the, bomb, in, flight, spin, stabilised, mortar, bombs, rotate, as, they, travel, along, and, leave, the, mortar, tube, which, stabilises, them, in, much, the, same, way, as, a, rifle, bullet, both, types, of, rounds, can, be, either, illumination, infrared, or, visible, illumination, smoke, high, explosive, and, training, rounds, mortar, bombs, are, often, referred, to, incorrectly, as, mortars, operators, may, fire, spin, stabilised, rounds, from, either, a, smoothbore, or, a, rifled, barrel, rifled, mortars, are, more, accurate, but, slower, to, load, since, mortars, are, generally, muzzle, loaded, mortar, bombs, for, rifled, barrels, usually, have, a, pre, engraved, band, called, an, obturator, that, engages, with, the, rifling, of, the, barrel, exceptions, to, this, were, the, u, s, m2, 4, 2, inch, mortar, and, m30, mortar, whose, ammunition, had, a, sub, calibre, expandable, ring, that, enlarged, when, fired, this, allows, the, projectile, to, slide, down, the, barrel, freely, but, grip, the, rifling, when, fired, the, system, resembles, the, mini, ball, for, muzzle, loading, rifles, for, extra, range, propellant, rings, augmentation, charges, are, attached, to, the, bomb, s, fins, the, rings, are, usually, easy, to, remove, because, they, have, a, major, influence, on, the, speed, and, thus, the, range, of, the, bomb, some, mortar, rounds, can, be, fired, without, any, augmentation, charges, e, g, the, 81, mm, l16, mortar, the, xm395, precision, guided, mortar, munition, pgmm, is, a, 120, mm, guided, mortar, round, developed, by, alliant, techsystems, based, on, orbital, atk, s, precision, guidance, kit, for, 155, mm, artillery, projectiles, xm395, combines, gps, guidance, and, directional, control, surfaces, into, a, package, that, replaces, standard, fuses, transforming, existing, 120, mm, mortar, bodies, into, precision, guided, munitions, the, xm395, munition, consists, of, a, gps, guided, kit, fitted, to, standard, 120, mm, smoothbore, mortar, rounds, that, includes, the, fitting, of, a, nose, and, tail, subsystem, containing, the, maneuvering, parts, the, strix, mortar, round, is, a, swedish, endphase, guided, projectile, fired, from, a, 120, mm, mortar, currently, manufactured, by, saab, bofors, dynamics, strix, is, fired, like, a, conventional, mortar, round, the, round, contains, an, infrared, imaging, sensor, that, it, uses, to, guide, itself, onto, any, tank, or, armoured, fighting, vehicle, in, the, vicinity, where, it, lands, the, seeker, is, designed, to, ignore, targets, that, are, already, burning, launched, from, any, 120, mm, mortar, strix, has, a, normal, range, of, up, to, 4, 5, km, 2, 8, mi, the, addition, of, a, special, sustainer, motor, increases, the, range, to, 7, 5, km, 4, 7, mi, the, gmm, 120, guided, mortar, munition, 120, known, as, patzmi, also, referred, to, as, morty, is, a, gps, and, or, laser, guided, mortar, munition, which, was, developed, by, israel, military, industries, another, israeli, guided, mortar, is, iron, sting, developed, by, elbit, the, russian, km, 8, gran, is, also, laser, guided, modern, mortars, and, their, ammunition, are, generally, much, smaller, and, lighter, than, long, range, artillery, such, as, field, guns, and, howitzers, which, allows, light, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, and, medium, 81, mm, 3, 2, in, 82, mm, 3, 2, in, mortars, to, be, considered, light, weapons, i, e, capable, of, transport, by, personnel, without, vehicle, assistance, mortars, are, short, range, weapons, and, often, more, effective, than, long, range, artillery, for, many, purposes, within, their, shorter, range, in, particular, because, of, its, high, parabolic, trajectory, with, a, near, vertical, descent, the, mortar, can, land, bombs, on, nearby, targets, including, those, behind, obstacles, or, in, fortifications, such, as, light, vehicles, behind, hills, or, structures, or, infantry, in, trenches, or, spider, holes, this, also, makes, it, possible, to, launch, attacks, from, positions, lower, than, the, target, of, the, attack, for, example, long, range, artillery, could, not, shell, a, target, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, away, and, 30, m, 98, ft, higher, a, target, easily, accessible, to, a, mortar, in, trench, warfare, mortars, can, use, plunging, fire, directly, into, the, enemy, trenches, which, is, very, hard, or, impossible, to, accomplish, with, long, range, artillery, because, of, its, much, flatter, trajectory, mortars, are, also, highly, effective, when, used, from, concealed, positions, such, as, the, natural, escarpments, on, hillsides, or, from, woods, especially, if, forward, observers, are, being, employed, in, strategic, positions, to, direct, fire, an, arrangement, where, the, mortar, is, in, relatively, close, proximity, both, to, its, forward, observer, and, its, target, allowing, for, fire, to, be, quickly, and, accurately, delivered, with, lethal, effect, mortars, suffer, from, instability, when, used, on, snow, or, soft, ground, because, the, recoil, pushes, them, into, the, ground, or, snow, unevenly, a, raschen, bag, addresses, this, problem, fin, stabilised, mortar, bombs, do, not, have, to, withstand, the, rotational, forces, placed, upon, them, by, rifling, or, greater, pressures, and, can, therefore, carry, a, higher, payload, in, a, thinner, skin, than, rifled, artillery, ammunition, because, of, the, difference, in, available, volume, a, smooth, bore, mortar, of, a, given, diameter, will, have, a, greater, explosive, yield, than, a, similarly, sized, artillery, shell, of, a, gun, or, howitzer, for, example, a, 120, mm, mortar, bomb, has, approximately, the, same, explosive, capability, as, a, 152, mm, 155, mm, artillery, shell, also, fin, stabilised, munitions, fired, from, a, smooth, bore, which, do, not, rely, on, the, spin, imparted, by, a, rifled, bore, for, greater, accuracy, do, not, have, the, drawback, of, veering, in, the, direction, of, the, spin, from, the, 17th, to, the, mid, 20th, century, very, heavy, relatively, immobile, siege, mortars, were, used, of, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, calibre, often, made, of, cast, iron, and, with, an, outside, barrel, diameter, many, times, that, of, the, bore, diameter, an, early, example, was, roaring, meg, with, a, 15, 5, in, 390, mm, barrel, diameter, and, firing, a, 220, lb, 100, kg, hollow, ball, filled, with, gunpowder, and, used, during, the, english, civil, war, in, 1646, the, largest, mortars, ever, developed, were, the, belgian, monster, mortar, 24, in, 610, mm, developed, by, henri, joseph, paixhans, in, 1832, mallet, s, mortar, 36, in, 910, mm, developed, by, robert, mallet, in, 1857, and, the, little, david, 36, in, 910, mm, developed, in, the, united, states, for, use, in, world, war, ii, although, the, latter, two, had, a, calibre, of, 36, in, 910, mm, only, the, monster, mortar, was, used, in, combat, at, the, battle, of, antwerp, in, 1832, the, world, war, ii, german, karl, ger, t, was, a, 60, cm, 24, in, mortar, and, the, largest, to, see, combat, in, modern, warfare
