an, unmanned, aerial, vehicle, uav, commonly, known, as, a, drone, is, an, aircraft, without, any, human, pilot, crew, or, passengers, on, board, uavs, were, originally, developed, through, the, twentieth, century, for, military, missions, too, dull, dirty, or, dangerous, for, humans, and, by, the, twenty, first, they, had, become, essential, assets, to, most, militaries, as, control, technologies, improved, and, costs, fell, their, use, expanded, to, many, non, military, applications, these, include, aerial, photography, area, coverage, precision, agriculture, forest, fire, monitoring, river, monitoring, environmental, monitoring, policing, and, surveillance, infrastructure, inspections, smuggling, product, deliveries, entertainment, and, drone, racing, many, terms, are, used, for, aircraft, which, fly, without, any, persons, on, board, the, term, drone, has, been, used, from, the, early, days, of, aviation, some, being, applied, to, remotely, flown, target, aircraft, used, for, practice, firing, of, a, battleship, s, guns, such, as, the, 1920s, fairey, queen, and, 1930s, de, havilland, queen, bee, later, examples, included, the, airspeed, queen, wasp, and, miles, queen, martinet, before, ultimate, replacement, by, the, gaf, jindivik, the, term, remains, in, common, use, in, addition, to, the, software, autonomous, drones, also, employ, a, host, of, advanced, technologies, that, allow, them, to, carry, out, their, missions, without, human, intervention, such, as, cloud, computing, computer, vision, artificial, intelligence, machine, learning, deep, learning, and, thermal, sensors, for, recreational, uses, an, aerial, photography, drone, is, an, aircraft, that, has, first, person, video, autonomous, capabilities, or, both, an, unmanned, aerial, vehicle, uav, is, defined, as, a, powered, aerial, vehicle, that, does, not, carry, a, human, operator, uses, aerodynamic, forces, to, provide, vehicle, lift, can, fly, autonomously, or, be, piloted, remotely, can, be, expendable, or, recoverable, and, can, carry, a, lethal, or, nonlethal, payload, uav, is, a, term, that, is, commonly, applied, to, military, use, cases, missiles, with, warheads, are, generally, not, considered, uavs, because, the, vehicle, itself, is, a, munition, but, certain, types, of, propeller, based, missile, are, often, called, kamikaze, drones, by, the, public, and, media, also, the, relation, of, uavs, to, remote, controlled, model, aircraft, is, unclear, uavs, may, or, may, not, include, remote, controlled, model, aircraft, some, jurisdictions, base, their, definition, on, size, or, weight, however, the, us, faa, defines, any, unmanned, flying, craft, as, a, uav, regardless, of, size, a, similar, term, is, remotely, piloted, aerial, vehicle, rpav, uavs, or, rpavs, can, also, be, seen, as, a, component, of, an, unmanned, aircraft, system, uas, which, also, includes, a, ground, based, controller, and, a, system, of, communications, with, the, aircraft, the, term, uas, was, adopted, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, dod, and, the, united, states, federal, aviation, administration, faa, in, 2005, according, to, their, unmanned, aircraft, system, roadmap, 2005, 2030, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, and, the, british, civil, aviation, authority, adopted, this, term, also, used, in, the, european, union, s, single, european, sky, ses, air, traffic, management, atm, research, sesar, joint, undertaking, roadmap, for, 2020, this, term, emphasizes, the, importance, of, elements, other, than, the, aircraft, it, includes, elements, such, as, ground, control, stations, data, links, and, other, support, equipment, similar, terms, are, unmanned, aircraft, vehicle, system, uavs, and, remotely, piloted, aircraft, system, rpas, many, similar, terms, are, in, use, under, new, regulations, which, came, into, effect, 1, june, 2019, the, term, rpas, has, been, adopted, by, the, canadian, government, to, mean, a, set, of, configurable, elements, consisting, of, a, remotely, piloted, aircraft, its, control, station, the, command, and, control, links, and, any, other, system, elements, required, during, flight, operation, uavs, may, be, classified, like, any, other, aircraft, according, to, design, configuration, such, as, weight, or, engine, type, maximum, flight, altitude, degree, of, operational, autonomy, operational, role, etc, according, to, the, united, states, department, of, defense, uavs, are, classified, into, five, categories, below, other, classifications, of, uavs, include, there, are, usually, five, categories, when, uavs, are, classified, by, range, and, endurance, there, are, usually, four, categories, when, uavs, are, classified, by, size, with, at, least, one, of, the, dimensions, length, or, wingspan, meet, the, following, respective, limits, based, on, their, weight, drones, can, be, classified, into, 5, categories, drones, could, also, be, classified, based, on, the, degree, of, autonomy, in, their, flight, operations, icao, classifies, unmanned, aircraft, as, either, remotely, piloted, aircraft, or, fully, autonomous, some, uavs, offer, intermediate, degrees, of, autonomy, for, example, a, vehicle, may, be, remotely, piloted, in, most, contexts, but, have, an, autonomous, return, to, base, operation, some, aircraft, types, may, optionally, fly, manned, or, as, uavs, which, may, include, manned, aircraft, transformed, into, manned, or, optionally, piloted, uavs, opvs, the, flight, of, uavs, may, operate, under, remote, control, by, a, human, operator, as, remotely, piloted, aircraft, rpa, or, with, various, degrees, of, autonomy, such, as, autopilot, assistance, up, to, fully, autonomous, aircraft, that, have, no, provision, for, human, intervention, based, on, the, altitude, the, following, uav, classifications, have, been, used, at, industry, events, such, as, parcaberporth, unmanned, systems, forum, an, example, of, classification, based, on, the, composite, criteria, is, u, s, military, s, unmanned, aerial, systems, uas, classification, of, uavs, based, on, weight, maximum, altitude, and, speed, of, the, uav, component, uavs, can, be, classified, based, on, their, power, or, energy, source, which, significantly, impacts, their, flight, duration, range, and, environmental, impact, the, main, categories, include, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, an, unmanned, aerial, vehicle, for, warfighting, occurred, in, july, 1849, with, a, balloon, carrier, the, precursor, to, the, aircraft, carrier, in, the, first, offensive, use, of, air, power, in, naval, aviation, austrian, forces, besieging, venice, attempted, to, launch, some, 200, incendiary, balloons, at, the, besieged, city, the, balloons, were, launched, mainly, from, land, however, some, were, also, launched, from, the, austrian, ship, sms, vulcano, at, least, one, bomb, fell, in, the, city, however, due, to, the, wind, changing, after, launch, most, of, the, balloons, missed, their, target, and, some, drifted, back, over, austrian, lines, and, the, launching, ship, vulcano, the, spanish, engineer, leonardo, torres, quevedo, introduced, a, radio, based, control, system, called, the, telekino, at, the, paris, academy, of, science, in, 1903, as, a, way, of, testing, airships, without, risking, human, life, significant, development, of, drones, started, in, the, 1900s, and, originally, focused, on, providing, practice, targets, for, training, military, personnel, the, earliest, attempt, at, a, powered, uav, was, a, m, low, s, aerial, target, in, 1916, low, confirmed, that, geoffrey, de, havilland, s, monoplane, was, the, one, that, flew, under, control, on, 21, march, 1917, using, his, radio, system, following, this, successful, demonstration, in, the, spring, of, 1917, low, was, transferred, to, develop, aircraft, controlled, fast, motor, launches, d, c, b, s, with, the, royal, navy, in, 1918, intended, to, attack, shipping, and, port, installations, and, he, also, assisted, wing, commander, brock, in, preparations, for, the, zeebrugge, raid, other, british, unmanned, developments, followed, leading, to, the, fleet, of, over, 400, de, havilland, 82, queen, bee, aerial, targets, that, went, into, service, in, 1935, nikola, tesla, described, a, fleet, of, uncrewed, aerial, combat, vehicles, in, 1915, these, developments, also, inspired, the, construction, of, the, kettering, bug, by, charles, kettering, from, dayton, ohio, and, the, hewitt, sperry, automatic, airplane, initially, meant, as, an, uncrewed, plane, that, would, carry, an, explosive, payload, to, a, predetermined, target, development, continued, during, world, war, i, when, the, dayton, wright, airplane, company, invented, a, pilotless, aerial, torpedo, that, would, explode, at, a, preset, time, the, film, star, and, model, airplane, enthusiast, reginald, denny, developed, the, first, scaled, remote, piloted, vehicle, in, 1935, soviet, researchers, experimented, with, controlling, tupolev, tb, 1, bombers, remotely, in, the, late, 1930s, in, 1940, denny, started, the, radioplane, company, and, more, models, emerged, during, world, war, ii, used, both, to, train, antiaircraft, gunners, and, to, fly, attack, missions, nazi, germany, produced, and, used, various, uav, aircraft, during, the, war, like, the, argus, as, 292, and, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, with, a, jet, engine, fascist, italy, developed, a, specialised, drone, version, of, the, savoia, marchetti, sm, 79, flown, by, remote, control, although, the, armistice, with, italy, was, enacted, prior, to, any, operational, deployment, after, world, war, ii, development, continued, in, vehicles, such, as, the, american, jb, 4, using, television, radio, command, guidance, the, australian, gaf, jindivik, and, teledyne, ryan, firebee, i, of, 1951, while, companies, like, beechcraft, offered, their, model, 1001, for, the, u, s, navy, in, 1955, nevertheless, they, were, little, more, than, remote, controlled, airplanes, until, the, vietnam, war, in, 1959, the, u, s, air, force, concerned, about, losing, pilots, over, hostile, territory, began, planning, for, the, use, of, uncrewed, aircraft, planning, intensified, after, the, soviet, union, shot, down, a, u, 2, in, 1960, within, days, a, highly, classified, uav, program, started, under, the, code, name, of, red, wagon, the, august, 1964, clash, in, the, tonkin, gulf, between, naval, units, of, the, u, s, and, the, north, vietnamese, navy, initiated, america, s, highly, classified, uavs, ryan, model, 147, ryan, aqm, 91, firefly, lockheed, d, 21, into, their, first, combat, missions, of, the, vietnam, war, when, the, chinese, government, showed, photographs, of, downed, u, s, uavs, via, wide, world, photos, the, official, u, s, response, was, no, comment, during, the, war, of, attrition, 1967, 1970, in, the, middle, east, israeli, intelligence, tested, the, first, tactical, uavs, installed, with, reconnaissance, cameras, which, successfully, returned, photos, from, across, the, suez, canal, this, was, the, first, time, that, tactical, uavs, that, could, be, launched, and, landed, on, any, short, runway, unlike, the, heavier, jet, based, uavs, were, developed, and, tested, in, battle, in, the, 1973, yom, kippur, war, israel, used, uavs, as, decoys, to, spur, opposing, forces, into, wasting, expensive, anti, aircraft, missiles, after, the, 1973, yom, kippur, war, a, few, key, people, from, the, team, that, developed, this, early, uav, joined, a, small, startup, company, that, aimed, to, develop, uavs, into, a, commercial, product, eventually, purchased, by, tadiran, and, leading, to, the, development, of, the, first, israeli, uav, in, 1973, the, u, s, military, officially, confirmed, that, they, had, been, using, uavs, in, southeast, asia, vietnam, over, 5, 000, u, s, airmen, had, been, killed, and, over, 1, 000, more, were, missing, or, captured, the, usaf, 100th, strategic, reconnaissance, wing, flew, about, 3, 435, uav, missions, during, the, war, at, a, cost, of, about, 554, uavs, lost, to, all, causes, in, the, words, of, usaf, general, george, s, brown, commander, air, force, systems, command, in, 1972, the, only, reason, we, need, uavs, is, that, we, don, t, want, to, needlessly, expend, the, man, in, the, cockpit, later, that, year, general, john, c, meyer, commander, in, chief, strategic, air, command, stated, we, let, the, drone, do, the, high, risk, flying, the, loss, rate, is, high, but, we, are, willing, to, risk, more, of, them, they, save, lives, during, the, 1973, yom, kippur, war, soviet, supplied, surface, to, air, missile, batteries, in, egypt, and, syria, caused, heavy, damage, to, israeli, fighter, jets, as, a, result, israel, developed, the, iai, scout, as, the, first, uav, with, real, time, surveillance, the, images, and, radar, decoys, provided, by, these, uavs, helped, israel, to, completely, neutralize, the, syrian, air, defenses, at, the, start, of, the, 1982, lebanon, war, resulting, in, no, pilots, downed, in, israel, in, 1987, uavs, were, first, used, as, proof, of, concept, of, super, agility, post, stall, controlled, flight, in, combat, flight, simulations, that, involved, tailless, stealth, technology, based, three, dimensional, thrust, vectoring, flight, control, and, jet, steering, with, the, maturing, and, miniaturization, of, applicable, technologies, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, interest, in, uavs, grew, within, the, higher, echelons, of, the, u, s, military, the, u, s, funded, the, counterterrorism, center, ctc, within, the, cia, which, sought, to, fight, terrorism, with, the, aid, of, modernized, drone, technology, in, the, 1990s, the, u, s, dod, gave, a, contract, to, aai, corporation, along, with, israeli, company, malat, the, u, s, navy, bought, the, aai, pioneer, uav, that, aai, and, malat, developed, jointly, many, of, these, uavs, saw, service, in, the, 1991, gulf, war, uavs, demonstrated, the, possibility, of, cheaper, more, capable, fighting, machines, deployable, without, risk, to, aircrews, initial, generations, primarily, involved, surveillance, aircraft, but, some, carried, armaments, such, as, the, general, atomics, mq, 1, predator, that, launched, agm, 114, hellfire, air, to, ground, missiles, capecon, a, european, union, project, to, develop, uavs, ran, from, 1, may, 2002, to, 31, december, 2005, as, of, 2012, the, united, states, air, force, usaf, employed, 7, 494, uavs, almost, one, in, three, usaf, aircraft, the, central, intelligence, agency, also, operated, uavs, by, 2013, at, least, 50, countries, used, uavs, china, iran, israel, pakistan, turkey, and, others, designed, and, built, their, own, varieties, the, use, of, drones, has, continued, to, increase, due, to, their, wide, proliferation, no, comprehensive, list, of, uav, systems, exists, the, development, of, smart, technologies, and, improved, electrical, power, systems, led, to, a, parallel, increase, in, the, use, of, drones, for, consumer, and, general, aviation, activities, as, of, 2021, quadcopter, drones, exemplify, the, widespread, popularity, of, hobby, radio, controlled, aircraft, and, toys, however, the, use, of, uavs, in, commercial, and, general, aviation, is, limited, by, a, lack, of, autonomy, and, by, new, regulatory, environments, which, require, line, of, sight, contact, with, the, pilot, in, 2020, a, kargu, 2, drone, hunted, down, and, attacked, a, human, target, in, libya, according, to, a, report, from, the, un, security, council, s, panel, of, experts, on, libya, published, in, march, 2021, this, may, have, been, the, first, time, an, autonomous, killer, robot, armed, with, lethal, weaponry, attacked, human, beings, superior, drone, technology, specifically, the, turkish, bayraktar, tb2, played, a, role, in, azerbaijan, s, successes, in, the, 2020, nagorno, karabakh, war, against, armenia, uavs, are, also, used, in, nasa, missions, the, ingenuity, helicopter, is, an, autonomous, uav, that, operated, on, mars, from, 2021, to, 2024, current, the, dragonfly, spacecraft, is, being, developed, and, is, aiming, to, reach, and, examine, saturn, s, moon, titan, its, primary, goal, is, to, roam, around, the, surface, expanding, the, amount, of, area, to, be, researched, previously, seen, by, landers, as, a, uav, dragonfly, allows, examination, of, potentially, diverse, types, of, soil, the, drone, is, set, to, launch, in, 2027, and, is, estimated, to, take, seven, more, years, to, reach, the, saturnian, system, miniaturization, is, also, supporting, the, development, of, small, uavs, which, can, be, used, as, individual, system, or, in, a, fleet, offering, the, possibility, to, survey, large, areas, in, a, relatively, small, amount, of, time, according, to, data, from, globaldata, the, global, military, uncrewed, aerial, systems, uas, market, which, forms, a, significant, part, of, the, uav, industry, is, projected, to, experience, a, compound, annual, growth, rate, of, 4, 8, over, the, next, decade, this, represents, a, near, doubling, in, market, size, from, 12, 5, billion, in, 2024, to, an, estimated, 20, billion, by, 2034, crewed, and, uncrewed, aircraft, of, the, same, type, generally, have, recognizably, similar, physical, components, the, main, exceptions, are, the, cockpit, and, environmental, control, system, or, life, support, systems, some, uavs, carry, payloads, such, as, a, camera, that, weigh, considerably, less, than, an, adult, human, and, as, a, result, can, be, considerably, smaller, though, they, carry, heavy, payloads, weaponized, military, uavs, are, lighter, than, their, crewed, counterparts, with, comparable, armaments, small, civilian, uavs, have, no, life, critical, systems, and, can, thus, be, built, out, of, lighter, but, less, sturdy, materials, and, shapes, and, can, use, less, robustly, tested, electronic, control, systems, for, small, uavs, the, quadcopter, design, has, become, popular, though, this, layout, is, rarely, used, for, crewed, aircraft, miniaturization, means, that, less, powerful, propulsion, technologies, can, be, used, that, are, not, feasible, for, crewed, aircraft, such, as, small, electric, motors, and, batteries, control, systems, for, uavs, are, often, different, from, crewed, craft, for, remote, human, control, a, camera, and, video, link, almost, always, replace, the, cockpit, windows, radio, transmitted, digital, commands, replace, physical, cockpit, controls, autopilot, software, is, used, on, both, crewed, and, uncrewed, aircraft, with, varying, feature, sets, uavs, can, be, designed, in, different, configurations, than, manned, aircraft, both, because, there, is, no, need, for, a, cockpit, and, its, windows, and, there, is, no, need, to, optimize, for, human, comfort, although, some, uavs, are, adapted, from, piloted, examples, or, are, designed, for, optionally, piloted, modes, air, safety, is, also, less, of, a, critical, requirement, for, unmanned, aircraft, allowing, the, designer, greater, freedom, to, experiment, instead, uavs, are, typically, designed, around, their, onboard, payloads, and, their, ground, equipment, these, factors, have, led, to, a, great, variety, of, airframe, and, motor, configurations, in, uavs, for, conventional, flight, the, flying, wing, and, blended, wing, body, offer, light, weight, combined, with, low, drag, and, stealth, and, are, popular, configurations, for, many, use, cases, larger, types, which, carry, a, variable, payload, are, more, likely, to, feature, a, distinct, fuselage, with, a, tail, for, stability, control, and, trim, although, the, wing, configurations, in, use, vary, widely, for, uses, that, require, vertical, flight, or, hovering, the, tailless, quadcopter, requires, a, relatively, simple, control, system, and, is, common, for, smaller, uavs, multirotor, designs, with, 6, or, more, rotors, is, more, common, with, larger, uavs, where, redundancy, is, prioritized, traditional, internal, combustion, and, jet, engines, remain, in, use, for, drones, requiring, long, range, however, for, shorter, range, missions, electric, power, has, almost, entirely, taken, over, the, distance, record, for, a, uav, built, from, balsa, wood, and, mylar, skin, across, the, north, atlantic, ocean, is, held, by, a, gasoline, model, airplane, or, uav, manard, hill, in, 2003, when, one, of, his, creations, flew, 1, 882, miles, across, the, atlantic, ocean, on, less, than, a, gallon, of, fuel, holds, this, record, besides, the, traditional, piston, engine, the, wankel, rotary, engine, is, used, by, some, drones, this, type, offers, high, power, output, for, lower, weight, with, quieter, and, more, vibration, free, running, claims, have, also, been, made, for, improved, reliability, and, greater, range, small, drones, mostly, use, lithium, polymer, batteries, li, po, while, some, larger, vehicles, have, adopted, the, hydrogen, fuel, cell, the, energy, density, of, modern, li, po, batteries, is, far, less, than, gasoline, or, hydrogen, however, electric, motors, are, cheaper, lighter, and, quieter, complex, multi, engine, multi, propeller, installations, are, under, development, with, the, goal, of, improving, aerodynamic, and, propulsive, efficiency, for, such, complex, power, installations, battery, elimination, circuitry, bec, may, be, used, to, centralize, power, distribution, and, minimize, heating, under, the, control, of, a, microcontroller, unit, mcu, flapping, wing, ornithopters, imitating, birds, or, insects, have, been, flown, as, microuavs, their, inherent, stealth, recommends, them, for, spy, missions, sub, 1g, microuavs, inspired, by, flies, albeit, using, a, power, tether, have, been, able, to, land, on, vertical, surfaces, other, projects, mimic, the, flight, of, beetles, and, other, insects, uav, computing, capability, followed, the, advances, of, computing, technology, beginning, with, analog, controls, and, evolving, into, microcontrollers, then, system, on, a, chip, soc, and, single, board, computers, sbc, modern, system, hardware, for, uav, control, is, often, called, the, flight, controller, fc, flight, controller, board, fcb, or, autopilot, common, uav, systems, control, hardware, typically, incorporate, a, primary, microprocessor, a, secondary, or, failsafe, processor, and, sensors, such, as, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and, barometers, into, a, single, module, in, 2024, easa, agreed, on, the, first, certification, basis, for, a, uav, flight, controller, in, compliance, with, the, etso, c198, for, embention, s, autopilot, the, certification, of, the, uav, flight, control, systems, aims, to, facilitate, the, integration, of, uavs, within, the, airspace, and, the, operation, of, drones, in, critical, areas, position, and, movement, sensors, give, information, about, the, aircraft, state, exteroceptive, sensors, deal, with, external, information, like, distance, measurements, while, exproprioceptive, ones, correlate, internal, and, external, states, non, cooperative, sensors, are, able, to, detect, targets, autonomously, so, they, are, used, for, separation, assurance, and, collision, avoidance, degrees, of, freedom, dof, refers, to, both, the, amount, and, quality, of, sensors, on, board, 6, dof, implies, 3, axis, gyroscopes, and, accelerometers, a, typical, inertial, measurement, unit, imu, 9, dof, refers, to, an, imu, plus, a, compass, 10, dof, adds, a, barometer, and, 11, dof, usually, adds, a, gps, receiver, in, addition, to, the, navigation, sensors, the, uav, or, uas, can, be, also, equipped, with, monitoring, devices, such, as, rgb, multispectral, hyper, spectral, cameras, or, lidar, which, may, allow, providing, specific, measurements, or, observations, uav, actuators, include, digital, electronic, speed, controllers, which, control, the, rpm, of, the, motors, linked, to, motors, engines, and, propellers, servomotors, for, planes, and, helicopters, mostly, weapons, payload, actuators, leds, and, speakers, the, software, running, on, a, uav, is, called, the, autopilot, or, the, flight, stack, the, purpose, of, the, flight, stack, is, to, fly, the, mission, autonomously, or, with, remote, pilot, input, an, autopilot, achieves, this, by, obtaining, data, from, sensors, controlling, the, motors, to, make, progress, along, a, path, and, facilitate, communications, with, ground, control, and, mission, planning, uavs, are, real, time, systems, that, require, high, frequency, to, changing, sensor, data, as, a, result, uavs, rely, on, single, board, computers, for, their, computational, needs, examples, of, such, single, board, computers, include, raspberry, pis, beagleboards, etc, shielded, with, navio, pxfmini, etc, or, designed, from, scratch, such, as, nuttx, preemptive, rt, linux, xenomai, orocos, robot, operating, system, or, dds, ros, 2, 0, due, to, the, open, source, nature, of, uav, software, they, can, be, customized, to, fit, specific, applications, for, example, researchers, from, the, technical, university, of, ko, ice, have, replaced, the, default, control, algorithm, of, the, px4, autopilot, this, flexibility, and, collaborative, effort, has, led, to, a, large, number, of, different, open, source, stacks, some, of, which, are, forked, from, others, such, as, cleanflight, which, is, forked, from, baseflight, and, from, which, three, other, stacks, are, forked, uavs, employ, open, loop, closed, loop, or, hybrid, control, architectures, uavs, use, a, radio, for, control, and, exchange, of, video, and, other, data, early, uavs, had, only, narrowband, uplink, downlinks, came, later, these, bi, directional, narrowband, radio, links, carried, command, and, control, c, c, and, telemetry, data, about, the, status, of, aircraft, systems, to, the, remote, operator, in, most, modern, uav, applications, video, transmission, is, required, so, instead, of, having, separate, links, for, c, c, telemetry, and, video, traffic, a, broadband, link, is, used, to, carry, all, types, of, data, these, broadband, links, can, leverage, quality, of, service, techniques, and, carry, tcp, ip, traffic, that, can, be, routed, over, the, internet, the, radio, signal, from, the, operator, side, can, be, issued, from, either, modern, networking, standards, have, explicitly, considered, drones, and, therefore, include, optimizations, the, 5g, standard, has, mandated, reduced, user, plane, latency, to, 1ms, while, using, ultra, reliable, and, low, latency, communications, uav, to, uav, coordination, supported, by, remote, id, communication, technology, remote, id, messages, containing, the, uav, coordinates, are, broadcast, and, can, be, used, for, collision, free, navigation, the, level, of, autonomy, in, uavs, varies, widely, uav, manufacturers, often, build, in, specific, autonomous, operations, such, as, one, approach, to, quantifying, autonomous, capabilities, is, based, on, ooda, terminology, as, suggested, by, a, 2002, us, air, force, research, laboratory, report, and, used, in, the, table, on, the, right, full, autonomy, is, available, for, specific, tasks, such, as, airborne, refueling, or, ground, based, battery, switching, other, functions, available, or, under, development, include, collective, flight, real, time, collision, avoidance, wall, following, corridor, centring, simultaneous, localization, and, mapping, and, swarming, cognitive, radio, and, machine, learning, in, this, context, computer, vision, can, play, an, important, role, for, automatically, ensuring, flight, safety, uavs, can, be, programmed, to, perform, aggressive, maneuvers, or, landing, perching, on, inclined, surfaces, and, then, to, climb, toward, better, communication, spots, some, uavs, can, control, flight, with, varying, flight, modelisation, such, as, vtol, designs, uavs, can, also, implement, perching, on, a, flat, vertical, surface, uav, endurance, is, not, constrained, by, the, physiological, capabilities, of, a, human, pilot, because, of, their, small, size, low, weight, low, vibration, and, high, power, to, weight, ratio, wankel, rotary, engines, are, used, in, many, large, uavs, their, engine, rotors, cannot, seize, the, engine, is, not, susceptible, to, shock, cooling, during, descent, and, it, does, not, require, an, enriched, fuel, mixture, for, cooling, at, high, power, these, attributes, reduce, fuel, usage, increasing, range, or, payload, proper, drone, cooling, is, essential, for, long, term, drone, endurance, overheating, and, subsequent, engine,

networks, uav, software, liability, is, bending, toward, the, design, and, certifications, of, crewed, avionics, software, swarm, resilience, involves, maintaining, operational, capabilities, and, reconfiguring, tasks, given, unit, failures, in, recent, years, autonomous, drones, have, begun, to, transform, various, application, areas, as, they, can, fly, beyond, visual, line, of, sight, bvlos, while, maximizing, production, reducing, costs, and, risks, ensuring, site, safety, security, and, regulatory, compliance, and, protecting, the, human, workforce, in, times, of, a, pandemic, they, can, also, be, used, for, consumer, related, missions, like, package, delivery, as, demonstrated, by, amazon, prime, air, and, critical, deliveries, of, health, supplies, there, are, numerous, civilian, commercial, military, and, aerospace, applications, for, uavs, these, include, as, of, 2020, seventeen, countries, have, armed, uavs, and, more, than, 100, countries, use, uavs, in, a, military, capacity, the, first, five, countries, producing, domestic, uav, designs, are, the, united, states, china, israel, iran, and, turkey, top, military, uav, manufactures, are, including, general, atomics, lockheed, martin, northrop, grumman, boeing, baykar, tai, iaio, casc, and, caig, china, has, established, and, expanded, its, presence, in, military, uav, market, since, 2010, in, the, early, 2020s, turkey, also, established, and, expanded, its, presence, in, the, military, uav, market, in, the, early, 2010s, israeli, companies, mainly, focus, on, small, surveillance, uav, systems, and, by, the, number, of, drones, israel, exported, 60, 7, 2014, of, uavs, on, the, market, while, the, united, states, exported, 23, 9, 2014, between, 2010, and, 2014, there, were, 439, drones, exchanged, compared, to, 322, in, the, five, years, previous, to, that, among, these, only, small, fraction, of, overall, trade, just, 11, 2, 5, of, the, 439, are, armed, drones, the, us, alone, operated, over, 9, 000, military, uavs, in, 2014, among, them, more, than, 7000, are, rq, 11, raven, miniature, uavs, since, 2010, chinese, drone, companies, have, begun, to, export, large, quantities, of, drones, to, the, global, military, market, of, the, 18, countries, that, are, known, to, have, received, military, drones, between, 2010, and, 2019, the, top, 12, all, purchased, their, drones, from, china, the, shift, accelerated, in, the, 2020s, due, to, china, s, advancement, in, drone, technologies, and, manufacturing, compounded, by, market, demand, from, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, and, the, israel, gaza, conflict, for, intelligence, and, reconnaissance, missions, the, inherent, stealth, of, micro, uav, flapping, wing, ornithopters, imitating, birds, or, insects, offers, potential, for, covert, surveillance, and, makes, them, difficult, targets, to, bring, down, unmanned, surveillance, and, reconnaissance, aerial, vehicle, are, used, for, reconnaissance, attack, demining, and, target, practice, following, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, a, dramatic, increase, in, uav, development, took, place, with, ukraine, creating, the, brave1, platform, to, promote, rapid, development, of, innovative, systems, the, civilian, commercial, and, general, drone, market, is, dominated, by, chinese, companies, chinese, manufacturer, dji, alone, had, 74, of, the, civil, market, share, in, 2018, with, no, other, company, accounting, for, more, than, 5, the, companies, continue, to, hold, over, 70, of, global, market, share, by, 2023, despite, under, increasing, scrutinies, and, sanctions, from, the, united, states, the, us, interior, department, grounded, its, fleet, of, dji, drones, in, 2020, while, the, justice, department, prohibited, the, use, of, federal, funds, for, the, purchase, of, dji, and, other, foreign, made, uavs, dji, is, followed, by, american, company, 3d, robotics, chinese, company, yuneec, autel, robotics, and, french, company, parrot, as, of, may, 2021, 873, 576, uavs, had, been, registered, with, the, us, faa, of, which, 42, were, categorized, as, commercial, and, 58, as, recreational, 2018, npd, point, to, consumers, increasingly, purchasing, drones, with, more, advanced, features, with, 33, percent, growth, in, both, the, 500, and, 1000, market, segments, the, civil, uav, market, is, relatively, new, compared, to, the, military, one, companies, are, emerging, in, both, developed, and, developing, nations, at, the, same, time, many, early, stage, startups, have, received, support, and, funding, from, investors, as, is, the, case, in, the, united, states, and, from, government, agencies, as, is, the, case, in, india, some, universities, offer, research, and, training, programs, or, degrees, private, entities, also, provide, online, and, in, person, training, programs, for, both, recreational, and, commercial, uav, use, consumer, drones, are, widely, used, by, police, and, military, organizations, worldwide, because, of, the, cost, effective, nature, of, consumer, products, since, 2018, the, israeli, military, have, used, dji, uavs, for, light, reconnaissance, missions, dji, drones, have, been, used, by, chinese, police, in, xinjiang, since, 2017, and, american, police, departments, nationwide, since, 2018, both, ukraine, and, russia, used, commercial, dji, drones, extensively, during, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, these, civilian, dji, drones, were, sourced, by, governments, hobbyists, international, donations, to, ukraine, and, russia, to, support, each, side, on, the, battlefield, and, were, often, flown, by, drone, hobbyists, recruited, by, the, armed, forces, the, prevalence, of, dji, drones, was, attributable, to, their, market, dominance, affordability, high, performance, and, reliability, drones, are, also, used, in, nighttime, displays, for, artistic, and, advertising, purposes, with, the, main, benefits, are, that, they, are, safer, quieter, and, better, for, the, environment, than, fireworks, they, can, replace, or, be, an, adjunct, for, fireworks, displays, to, reduce, the, financial, burden, of, festivals, in, addition, they, can, complement, fireworks, due, to, the, ability, for, drones, to, carry, them, creating, new, forms, of, artwork, in, the, process, drones, can, also, be, used, for, racing, either, with, or, without, vr, functionality, drones, are, ideally, suited, to, capturing, aerial, shots, in, photography, and, cinematography, and, are, widely, used, for, this, purpose, small, drones, avoid, the, need, for, precise, coordination, between, pilot, and, cameraman, with, the, same, person, taking, on, both, roles, big, drones, with, professional, cine, cameras, usually, have, a, drone, pilot, and, a, camera, operator, who, controls, camera, angle, and, lens, for, example, the, aerigon, cinema, drone, which, is, used, in, film, production, in, big, blockbuster, movies, is, operated, by, 2, people, drones, provide, access, to, dangerous, remote, or, otherwise, inaccessible, sites, uass, or, uavs, offer, the, great, advantage, for, environmental, monitoring, to, generate, a, new, generation, of, survey, at, very, high, or, ultra, high, resolution, both, in, space, and, time, this, gives, the, opportunity, to, bridge, the, existing, gap, between, satellite, data, and, field, monitoring, this, has, stimulated, a, huge, number, of, activities, in, order, to, enhance, the, description, of, natural, and, agricultural, ecosystems, most, common, applications, are, these, activities, can, be, completed, with, different, measurements, such, as, photogrammetry, thermography, multispectral, images, 3d, field, scanning, and, normalized, difference, vegetation, index, maps, uavs, have, become, a, widely, used, tool, for, studying, geohazards, such, as, landslides, various, sensors, including, radar, optical, and, thermal, can, be, mounted, on, uavs, to, monitor, different, properties, uavs, enable, the, capture, of, images, of, various, landslide, features, such, as, transverse, radial, and, longitudinal, cracks, ridges, scarps, and, surfaces, of, rupture, even, in, inaccessible, areas, of, the, sliding, mass, moreover, processing, the, optical, images, captured, by, uavs, also, allows, for, the, creation, of, point, clouds, and, 3d, models, from, which, these, properties, can, be, derived, comparing, point, clouds, obtained, at, different, times, allows, for, the, detection, of, changes, caused, by, landslide, deformation, as, global, demand, for, food, production, grows, exponentially, resources, are, depleted, farmland, is, reduced, and, agricultural, labor, is, increasingly, in, short, supply, there, is, an, urgent, need, for, more, convenient, and, smarter, agricultural, solutions, than, traditional, methods, and, the, agricultural, drone, and, robotics, industry, is, expected, to, make, progress, agricultural, drones, have, been, used, to, help, build, sustainable, agriculture, all, over, the, world, leading, to, a, new, generation, of, agriculture, in, this, context, there, is, a, proliferation, of, innovations, in, both, tools, and, methodologies, which, allow, precise, description, of, vegetation, state, and, also, may, help, to, precisely, distribute, nutrients, pesticides, or, seeds, over, a, field, the, use, of, uavs, is, also, being, investigated, to, help, detect, and, fight, wildfires, whether, through, observation, or, launching, pyrotechnic, devices, to, start, backfires, uavs, are, also, now, widely, used, to, survey, wildlife, such, as, nesting, seabirds, seals, and, even, wombat, burrows, police, can, use, drones, for, applications, such, as, search, and, rescue, and, traffic, monitoring, drones, are, increasingly, finding, their, application, in, humanitarian, aid, and, disaster, relief, where, they, are, used, for, a, wide, range, of, applications, such, as, delivering, food, medicine, and, essential, items, to, remote, areas, or, image, mapping, before, and, following, disasters, uavs, can, threaten, airspace, security, in, numerous, ways, including, unintentional, collisions, or, other, interference, with, other, aircraft, deliberate, attacks, or, by, distracting, pilots, or, flight, controllers, the, first, incident, of, a, drone, airplane, collision, occurred, in, mid, october, 2017, in, quebec, city, canada, the, first, recorded, instance, of, a, drone, collision, with, a, hot, air, balloon, occurred, on, 10, august, 2018, in, driggs, idaho, united, states, although, there, was, no, significant, damage, to, the, balloon, nor, any, injuries, to, its, 3, occupants, the, balloon, pilot, reported, the, incident, to, the, national, transportation, safety, board, stating, that, i, hope, this, incident, helps, create, a, conversation, of, respect, for, nature, the, airspace, and, rules, and, regulations, unauthorized, uav, flights, into, or, near, major, airports, have, prompted, extended, shutdowns, of, commercial, flights, drones, caused, significant, disruption, at, gatwick, airport, during, december, 2018, needing, the, deployment, of, the, british, army, in, the, united, states, flying, close, to, a, wildfire, is, punishable, by, a, maximum, 25, 000, fine, nonetheless, in, 2014, and, 2015, firefighting, air, support, in, california, was, hindered, on, several, occasions, including, at, the, lake, fire, and, the, north, fire, in, response, california, legislators, introduced, a, bill, that, would, allow, firefighters, to, disable, uavs, which, invaded, restricted, airspace, the, faa, later, required, registration, of, most, uavs, by, 2017, drones, were, being, used, to, drop, contraband, into, prisons, the, interest, in, uavs, cyber, security, has, been, raised, greatly, after, the, predator, uav, video, stream, hijacking, incident, in, 2009, where, islamic, militants, used, cheap, off, the, shelf, equipment, to, stream, video, feeds, from, a, uav, another, risk, is, the, possibility, of, hijacking, or, jamming, a, uav, in, flight, several, security, researchers, have, made, public, some, vulnerabilities, in, commercial, uavs, in, some, cases, even, providing, full, source, code, or, tools, to, reproduce, their, attacks, at, a, workshop, on, uavs, and, privacy, in, october, 2016, researchers, from, the, federal, trade, commission, showed, they, were, able, to, hack, into, three, different, consumer, quadcopters, and, noted, that, uav, manufacturers, can, make, their, uavs, more, secure, by, the, basic, security, measures, of, encrypting, the, wi, fi, signal, and, adding, password, protection, uavs, could, be, loaded, with, dangerous, payloads, and, crashed, into, vulnerable, targets, payloads, could, include, explosives, chemical, radiological, or, biological, hazards, uavs, with, generally, non, lethal, payloads, could, possibly, be, hacked, and, put, to, malicious, purposes, anti, uav, systems, are, being, developed, by, states, to, counter, this, threat, this, is, however, proving, difficult, as, j, rogers, stated, in, an, interview, to, a, t, there, is, a, big, debate, out, there, at, the, moment, about, what, the, best, way, is, to, counter, these, small, uavs, whether, they, are, used, by, hobbyists, causing, a, bit, of, a, nuisance, or, in, a, more, sinister, manner, by, a, terrorist, actor, the, malicious, use, of, uavs, has, led, to, the, development, of, counter, unmanned, air, system, c, uas, technologies, automatic, tracking, and, detection, of, uavs, from, commercial, cameras, have, become, accurate, thanks, to, the, development, of, deep, learning, based, machine, learning, algorithms, it, is, also, possible, to, automatically, identify, uavs, across, different, cameras, with, different, view, points, and, hardware, specification, with, re, identification, methods, commercial, systems, such, as, the, aaronia, aartos, have, been, installed, on, major, international, airports, once, a, uav, is, detected, it, can, be, countered, with, kinetic, force, missiles, projectiles, or, another, uav, or, by, non, kinetic, force, laser, microwaves, communications, jamming, anti, aircraft, missile, systems, such, as, the, iron, dome, are, also, being, enhanced, with, c, uas, technologies, utilising, a, smart, uav, swarm, to, counter, one, or, more, hostile, uavs, is, also, proposed, regulatory, bodies, around, the, world, are, developing, unmanned, aircraft, system, traffic, management, solutions, to, better, integrate, uavs, into, airspace, the, use, of, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, is, becoming, increasingly, regulated, by, the, civil, aviation, authorities, of, individual, countries, regulatory, regimes, can, differ, significantly, according, to, drone, size, and, use, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, began, exploring, the, use, of, drone, technology, as, far, back, as, 2005, which, resulted, in, a, 2011, report, france, was, among, the, first, countries, to, set, a, national, framework, based, on, this, report, and, larger, aviation, bodies, such, as, the, faa, and, the, easa, quickly, followed, suit, in, 2021, the, faa, published, a, rule, requiring, all, commercially, used, uavs, and, all, uavs, regardless, of, intent, weighing, 250g, or, more, to, participate, in, remote, id, which, makes, drone, locations, controller, locations, and, other, information, public, from, takeoff, to, shutdown, this, rule, has, since, been, challenged, in, the, pending, federal, lawsuit, racedayquads, v, faa, the, implementation, of, the, class, identification, label, serves, a, crucial, purpose, in, the, regulation, and, operation, of, drones, the, label, is, a, verification, mechanism, designed, to, confirm, that, drones, within, a, specific, class, meet, the, rigorous, standards, set, by, administrations, for, design, and, manufacturing, these, standards, are, necessary, to, ensure, the, safety, and, reliability, of, drones, in, various, industries, and, applications, by, providing, this, assurance, to, customers, the, class, identification, label, helps, to, increase, confidence, in, drone, technology, and, encourages, wider, adoption, across, industries, this, in, turn, contributes, to, the, growth, and, development, of, the, drone, industry, and, supports, the, integration, of, drones, into, society, the, export, of, uavs, or, technology, capable, of, carrying, a, 500, kg, payload, at, least, 300, km, is, restricted, in, many, countries, by, the, missile, technology, control, regime
