often, used, for, recreational, camping, and, as, temporary, shelters, tents, range, in, size, from, bivouac, structures, just, big, enough, for, one, person, to, sleep, in, up, to, huge, circus, tents, capable, of, seating, thousands, of, people, tents, for, recreational, camping, fall, into, two, categories, tents, intended, to, be, carried, by, backpackers, are, the, smallest, and, lightest, type, small, tents, may, be, sufficiently, light, that, they, can, be, carried, for, long, distances, on, a, touring, bicycle, a, boat, or, when, backpacking, the, second, type, are, larger, heavier, tents, which, are, usually, carried, in, a, car, or, other, vehicle, depending, on, tent, size, and, the, experience, of, the, person, or, people, involved, such, tents, can, usually, be, assembled, pitched, in, between, 5, and, 25, minutes, disassembly, striking, takes, a, similar, length, of, time, some, very, specialised, tents, have, spring, loaded, poles, and, can, be, pitched, in, seconds, but, take, somewhat, longer, to, strike, take, down, and, pack, over, the, past, decade, tents, have, also, been, increasingly, linked, with, homelessness, crises, in, the, united, states, canada, and, other, regions, places, of, multiple, homeless, people, living, in, tents, closely, pitched, or, plotted, near, each, other, are, often, referred, to, as, tent, cities, a, form, of, tent, called, a, teepee, or, tipi, noted, for, its, cone, shape, and, peak, smoke, hole, was, also, used, by, native, american, tribes, and, aboriginal, canadians, of, the, plains, indians, since, ancient, times, variously, estimated, from, 10, 000, to, 4, 000, years, bc, tents, were, used, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, early, iron, age, they, are, mentioned, in, the, bible, for, example, in, genesis, 4, 20, jabal, is, described, as, the, first, to, live, in, tents, and, raise, sheep, and, goats, the, roman, army, used, leather, tents, copies, of, which, have, been, used, successfully, by, modern, re, enactors, various, styles, developed, over, time, some, derived, from, traditional, nomadic, tents, such, as, the, yurt, most, military, tents, throughout, history, were, of, a, simple, ridge, design, the, major, technological, advance, was, the, use, of, linen, or, hemp, canvas, for, the, canopy, versus, leather, for, the, romans, the, primary, use, of, tents, was, still, to, provide, portable, shelter, for, a, small, number, of, men, in, the, field, by, world, war, i, larger, designs, were, being, deployed, in, rear, areas, to, provide, shelter, for, support, activities, and, supplies, tents, are, used, as, habitation, by, nomads, recreational, campers, soldiers, and, disaster, victims, tents, are, also, typically, used, as, overhead, shelter, for, festivals, weddings, backyard, parties, major, corporate, events, excavation, construction, covers, and, industrial, shelters, tents, have, traditionally, been, used, by, nomadic, people, all, over, the, world, such, as, native, americans, mongolian, turkic, and, tibetan, nomads, and, the, bedouin, armies, all, over, the, world, have, long, used, tents, as, part, of, their, working, life, tents, are, preferred, by, the, military, for, their, relatively, quick, setup, and, take, down, times, compared, to, more, traditional, shelters, one, of, the, world, s, largest, users, of, tents, is, the, u, s, department, of, defense, the, u, s, dod, has, strict, rules, on, tent, quality, and, tent, specifications, the, most, common, tent, uses, for, the, military, are, temporary, sleeping, quarters, barracks, dining, facilities, dfacs, field, headquarters, morale, welfare, and, recreation, mwr, facilities, and, security, checkpoints, one, of, the, most, popular, military, designs, currently, fielded, is, the, temper, tent, an, acronym, for, tent, expandable, modular, personnel, the, united, states, army, is, beginning, to, use, a, more, modern, tent, called, the, deployable, rapid, assembly, shelter, or, drash, a, collapsible, tent, with, provisions, for, air, conditioning, and, heating, camping, is, a, popular, form, of, recreation, which, often, involves, the, use, of, tents, a, tent, is, economical, and, practical, because, of, its, portability, and, low, environmental, impact, these, qualities, are, necessary, when, used, in, the, wilderness, or, backcountry, tents, are, often, used, in, humanitarian, emergencies, such, as, war, earthquakes, and, fire, the, primary, choice, of, tents, in, humanitarian, emergencies, are, canvas, tents, because, a, cotton, canvas, tent, allows, functional, breathability, while, serving, the, purpose, of, temporary, shelter, tents, distributed, by, organisations, such, as, unhcr, are, made, by, various, manufacturers, depending, on, the, region, where, the, tents, are, deployed, as, well, as, depending, on, the, purpose, at, times, however, these, temporary, shelters, become, a, permanent, or, semi, permanent, home, especially, for, displaced, people, living, in, refugee, camps, or, shanty, towns, who, can, not, return, to, their, former, home, and, for, whom, no, replacement, homes, are, made, available, tents, have, been, increasingly, used, as, shelter, for, homeless, people, in, the, u, s, especially, california, oregon, and, washington, encampments, spiked, in, the, mid, to, late, 2010s, these, tent, cities, housing, many, homeless, and, travelers, vagabonds, have, also, are, also, commonly, found, in, major, cities, in, the, south, including, austin, texas, which, had, passed, a, restriction, on, homeless, encampments, in, may, 2021, tents, are, also, often, used, as, sites, and, symbols, of, protest, over, time, in, 1968, resurrection, city, saw, hundreds, of, tents, set, up, by, anti, poverty, campaigners, in, washington, d, c, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, anti, nuclear, peace, camps, spread, across, europe, and, north, america, with, the, largest, women, s, only, camp, to, date, set, up, outside, the, raf, greenham, common, united, states, airbase, in, newbury, england, to, protest, the, deployment, there, of, cruise, missiles, during, the, cold, war, the, 1990s, saw, environmental, protest, camps, as, part, of, the, campaign, for, the, clayoquot, sound, in, canada, and, the, roads, protests, in, the, uk, the, first, no, border, network, camp, was, held, in, strasbourg, in, 2002, becoming, the, first, in, a, series, of, international, camps, that, continue, to, be, organised, today, other, international, camps, of, the, 2000s, include, summit, counter, mobilisations, like, horizone, at, the, gleneagles, g8, gathering, in, 2005, and, the, start, of, camp, for, climate, action, in, 2006, since, september, 2011, the, tent, has, been, used, as, a, symbol, of, the, occupy, movement, an, international, protest, movement, which, is, primarily, directed, against, economic, and, social, inequality, occupy, protesters, use, tents, to, create, camps, in, public, places, wherein, they, can, form, communities, of, open, discussion, and, democratic, action, generally, the, interior, of, an, enclosed, tent, is, about, 10, degrees, fahrenheit, warmer, than, the, outside, environment, not, accounting, for, wind, chill, due, to, the, retention, of, body, heat, and, to, a, lesser, extent, radiation, tent, fabric, may, be, made, of, many, materials, including, cotton, canvas, nylon, felt, and, polyester, cotton, absorbs, water, so, it, can, become, very, heavy, when, wet, but, the, associated, swelling, tends, to, block, any, minute, holes, so, that, wet, cotton, is, more, waterproof, than, dry, cotton, cotton, tents, were, often, treated, with, paraffin, to, enhance, water, resistance, nylon, and, polyester, are, much, lighter, than, cotton, and, do, not, absorb, much, water, with, suitable, coatings, they, can, be, very, waterproof, but, they, tend, to, deteriorate, over, time, due, to, a, slow, chemical, breakdown, caused, by, ultraviolet, light, the, most, common, treatments, to, make, fabric, waterproof, are, silicone, impregnation, or, polyurethane, coating, since, stitching, makes, tiny, holes, in, a, fabric, seams, are, often, sealed, or, taped, to, block, these, holes, and, maintain, waterproofness, though, in, practice, a, carefully, sewn, seam, can, be, waterproof, rain, resistance, is, measured, and, expressed, as, hydrostatic, head, in, millimetres, mm, this, indicates, the, pressure, of, water, needed, to, penetrate, a, fabric, heavy, or, wind, driven, rain, has, a, higher, pressure, than, light, rain, standing, on, a, groundsheet, increases, the, pressure, on, any, water, underneath, fabric, with, a, hydrostatic, head, rating, of, 1000, mm, or, less, is, best, regarded, as, shower, resistant, with, 1500, mm, being, usually, suitable, for, summer, camping, tents, for, year, round, use, generally, have, at, least, 2000, mm, expedition, tents, intended, for, extreme, conditions, are, often, rated, at, 3000, mm, where, quoted, groundsheets, may, be, rated, for, 5000, mm, or, more, many, tent, manufacturers, indicate, capacity, by, such, phrases, as, 3, berth, or, 2, person, these, numbers, indicate, how, many, people, the, manufacturer, thinks, can, use, the, tent, though, these, numbers, do, not, always, allow, for, any, personal, belongings, such, as, luggage, inflatable, mattresses, camp, beds, cots, etc, nor, do, they, always, allow, for, people, who, are, of, above, average, height, checking, the, quoted, sizes, of, sleeping, areas, reveals, that, several, manufacturers, consider, that, a, width, of, 150, cm, 4, 9, ft, is, enough, for, three, people, snug, is, the, operative, word, experience, indicates, that, camping, may, be, more, comfortable, if, the, actual, number, of, occupants, is, one, or, even, two, less, than, the, manufacturer, s, suggestion, though, different, manufacturers, have, different, standards, for, space, requirement, and, there, is, no, accepted, standard, tent, used, in, areas, with, biting, insects, often, have, their, vent, and, door, openings, covered, with, fine, mesh, netting, tents, can, be, improvised, using, waterproof, fabric, string, and, sticks, there, are, three, basic, configurations, of, tents, each, of, which, may, appear, with, many, variations, single, skin, usa, single, wall, only, one, waterproof, layer, of, fabric, is, used, comprising, at, least, roof, and, walls, to, minimize, condensation, on, the, inside, of, the, tent, some, expedition, tents, use, waterproof, breathable, fabrics, single, skin, with, flysheet, a, waterproof, flysheet, or, rain, fly, is, suspended, over, and, clear, of, the, roof, of, the, tent, it, often, overlaps, the, tent, roof, slightly, but, does, not, extend, down, the, sides, or, ends, of, the, tent, double, skin, usa, double, wall, the, outer, tent, is, a, waterproof, layer, which, extends, down, to, the, ground, all, round, one, or, more, inner, tents, provide, sleeping, areas, the, outer, tent, may, be, just, a, little, larger, than, the, inner, tent, or, it, may, be, a, lot, larger, and, provide, a, covered, living, area, separate, from, the, sleeping, area, s, an, inner, tent, is, not, waterproof, but, allows, water, vapour, to, pass, through, so, that, condensation, occurs, only, on, the, exterior, side, the, double, layer, may, also, provide, some, thermal, insulation, either, the, outer, skin, or, the, inner, skin, may, be, the, structural, component, carrying, the, poles, the, structural, skin, is, always, pitched, first, though, some, tents, are, built, with, the, outer, and, inner, linked, so, that, they, are, both, pitched, at, the, same, time, components, many, factors, affect, tent, design, including, shelters, are, not, normally, used, for, sleeping, instead, they, may, act, as, a, store, or, provide, shelter, from, sun, rain, or, dew, with, modern, materials, tent, manufacturers, have, great, freedom, to, vary, types, and, styles, and, shapes, of, tents, many, tents, which, use, rigid, steel, poles, are, free, standing, and, do, not, require, guy, ropes, though, they, may, require, pegs, around, the, bottom, edge, of, the, fabric, these, tents, are, usually, so, heavy, 25, to, 80, kg, that, it, takes, a, rather, strong, wind, to, blow, them, away, flexible, poles, used, for, tents, in, this, section, are, typically, between, 3, and, 6, metres, 9, 8, and, 19, 7, ft, long, cheap, poles, are, made, of, tubes, of, fibreglass, with, an, external, diameter, less, than, 1, cm, 1, 3, in, whereas, more, expensive, aluminium, alloys, are, the, material, of, choice, for, added, strength, and, durability, for, ease, of, transportation, these, poles, are, made, in, sections, some, 30, to, 60, cm, 0, 98, to, 1, 97, ft, long, with, one, end, of, each, section, having, a, socket, into, which, the, next, section, can, fit, for, ease, of, assembly, the, sections, for, each, pole, are, often, connected, by, an, internal, elastic, cord, running, the, entire, length, of, the, pole, inflatable, pole, supports, also, known, as, airbeams, serve, as, rigid, structural, supports, when, inflated, but, are, soft, and, pliable, when, deflated, tents, using, such, technology, are, neither, commonly, used, nor, widely, accepted, and, are, available, from, a, very, limited, number, of, suppliers, much, like, a, bicycle, tube, and, tire, airbeams, are, often, composed, of, a, highly, dimensionally, stable, i, e, no, stretch, fabric, sleeve, and, an, air, holding, inner, bladder, however, other, airbeam, constructions, consist, of, coated, fabrics, that, are, cut, and, manufactured, to, its, intended, shape, by, a, method, such, as, thermal, welding, depending, on, the, desired, tent, size, airbeams, can, be, anywhere, from, 2, 40, inches, in, diameter, inflated, to, different, pressures, high, pressure, airbeams, 40, 80, psi, that, are, filled, by, compressors, are, most, often, used, in, larger, shelters, whereas, low, pressure, beams, 5, 7, psi, are, preferred, for, recreational, use, the, relatively, low, pressure, enables, the, use, of, a, manual, pump, to, inflate, the, airbeam, to, the, desired, level, airbeams, have, the, unique, quality, of, bending, rather, than, breaking, when, overloaded, tents, that, use, inflatable, airbeams, are, structured, almost, identically, to, those, that, use, flexible, poles, most, of, these, tent, styles, are, no, longer, generally, available, most, of, these, are, single, skin, designs, with, optional, fly, sheets, for, the, ridge, tents, all, the, tents, listed, here, had, a, canvas, fabric, and, most, used, a, substantial, number, of, guy, ropes, 8, to, 18, the, guys, had, to, be, positioned, and, tensioned, fairly, precisely, in, order, to, pitch, the, tent, correctly, so, some, training, and, experience, were, needed, pup, tents, might, use, wooden, or, metal, poles, but, all, the, other, styles, mentioned, here, used, wooden, poles, these, larger, tents, are, seldom, used, for, sleeping, tent, design, has, influenced, many, large, modern, buildings, these, buildings, have, in, turn, influenced, the, next, generation, of, tent, design, tent, style, tensile, structures, are, used, to, cover, large, public, areas, such, as, entertainment, venues, arenas, and, retail, areas, example, the, o, 2, or, sports, stadiums, example, munich, olympic, stadium, and, airports, example, denver, international, airport, the, sami, parliament, of, norway, is, inspired, by, the, lavvu, a, tent, traditionally, used, by, the, sami, people
