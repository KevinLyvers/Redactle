a, wheelbarrow, is, a, small, hand, propelled, load, bearing, vehicle, usually, with, just, one, wheel, designed, to, be, pushed, and, guided, by, a, single, person, using, two, handles, at, the, rear, the, term, wheelbarrow, is, made, of, two, words, wheel, and, barrow, barrow, is, a, derivation, of, the, old, english, barew, which, was, a, device, used, for, carrying, loads, the, wheelbarrow, is, designed, to, distribute, the, weight, of, its, load, between, the, wheel, and, the, operator, so, enabling, the, convenient, carriage, of, heavier, and, bulkier, loads, than, would, be, possible, were, the, weight, carried, entirely, by, the, operator, as, such, it, is, a, second, class, lever, traditional, chinese, wheelbarrows, however, had, a, central, wheel, supporting, the, whole, load, use, of, wheelbarrows, is, common, in, the, construction, industry, and, in, gardening, typical, capacity, is, approximately, 100, litres, 3, 53, cubic, feet, of, material, a, two, wheel, type, is, more, stable, on, level, ground, while, the, almost, universal, one, wheel, type, has, better, maneuverability, in, small, spaces, on, planks, in, water, or, when, tilted, ground, would, throw, the, load, off, balance, the, use, of, one, wheel, also, permits, greater, control, of, the, deposition, of, the, load, upon, emptying, the, earliest, wheelbarrows, with, archaeological, evidence, in, the, form, of, a, one, wheel, cart, come, from, second, century, han, dynasty, emperor, hui, s, tomb, murals, and, brick, tomb, reliefs, the, painted, tomb, mural, of, a, man, pushing, a, wheelbarrow, was, found, in, a, tomb, at, chengdu, sichuan, province, dated, precisely, to, 118, ad, the, stone, carved, relief, of, a, man, pushing, a, wheelbarrow, was, found, in, the, tomb, of, shen, fujun, in, sichuan, province, dated, circa, 150, ad, and, then, there, is, the, story, of, the, pious, dong, yuan, pushing, his, father, around, in, a, single, wheel, lu, che, barrow, depicted, in, a, mural, of, the, wu, liang, tomb, shrine, of, shandong, dated, to, 147, ad, earlier, accounts, dating, to, the, 1st, century, bc, and, 1st, century, ad, that, mention, a, deer, cart, luche, might, also, have, been, referencing, a, wheelbarrow, the, 5th, century, book, of, later, han, stated, that, the, wife, of, the, once, poor, and, youthful, imperial, censor, bao, xuan, helped, him, push, a, lu, che, back, to, his, village, during, their, feeble, wedding, ceremony, around, 30, bc, later, during, the, red, eyebrows, rebellion, c, 20, ad, against, xin, dynasty, s, wang, mang, 45, bc, 23, ad, the, official, zhao, xi, saved, his, wife, from, danger, by, disguising, himself, and, pushing, her, along, in, his, lu, che, barrow, past, a, group, of, brigand, rebels, who, questioned, him, and, allowed, him, to, pass, after, he, convinced, them, that, his, wife, was, terribly, ill, the, first, recorded, description, of, a, wheelbarrow, appears, in, liu, xiang, s, work, lives, of, famous, immortals, liu, describes, the, invention, of, the, wheelbarrow, by, the, legendary, chinese, mythological, figure, ko, yu, who, builds, a, wooden, ox, nevertheless, the, chinese, historical, text, of, the, sanguozhi, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, compiled, by, the, ancient, historian, chen, shou, 233, 297, ad, credits, the, invention, of, the, wheelbarrow, to, prime, minister, zhuge, liang, 181, 234, ad, of, shu, han, from, 197, 234, it, was, written, that, in, 231, ad, zhuge, liang, developed, the, vehicle, of, the, wooden, ox, and, used, it, as, a, transport, for, military, supplies, in, a, campaign, against, cao, wei, further, annotations, of, the, text, by, pei, songzhi, 430, ad, described, the, design, in, detail, as, a, large, single, central, wheel, and, axle, around, which, a, wooden, frame, was, constructed, in, representation, of, an, ox, writing, later, in, the, 11th, century, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, scholar, gao, cheng, wrote, that, the, small, wheelbarrow, of, his, day, with, shafts, pointing, forward, so, that, it, was, pulled, was, the, direct, descendant, of, zhuge, liang, s, wooden, ox, furthermore, he, pointed, out, that, the, third, century, gliding, horse, wheelbarrow, featured, the, simple, difference, of, the, shaft, pointing, backwards, so, that, it, was, pushed, instead, wheelbarrows, in, china, came, in, two, types, the, more, common, type, after, the, third, century, has, a, large, centrally, mounted, wheel, prior, types, were, universally, front, wheeled, wheelbarrows, the, central, wheeled, wheelbarrow, could, generally, transport, six, human, passengers, at, once, and, instead, of, a, laborious, amount, of, energy, exacted, upon, the, animal, or, human, driver, pulling, the, wheelbarrow, the, weight, of, the, burden, was, distributed, equally, between, the, wheel, and, the, puller, european, visitors, to, china, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, had, an, appreciation, for, this, and, it, was, given, a, considerable, amount, of, attention, by, a, member, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, andreas, everardus, van, braam, houckgeest, in, his, writings, of, 1797, who, accurately, described, its, design, and, ability, to, hold, large, amounts, of, heavy, baggage, these, wheelbarrows, continued, in, use, into, the, twentieth, century, and, a, good, example, of, this, is, the, piepkar, which, is, a, wheelbarrow, on, rails, and, was, found, in, sumatra, on, billiton, island, however, the, lower, carrying, surface, made, the, european, wheelbarrow, clearly, more, useful, for, short, haul, work, as, of, the, 1960s, traditional, wheelbarrows, in, china, were, still, in, wide, use, although, there, are, records, of, chinese, sailing, carriages, from, the, 6th, century, these, land, sailing, vehicles, were, not, wheelbarrows, and, the, date, of, which, the, sail, assisted, wheelbarrow, was, invented, is, uncertain, engravings, are, found, in, van, braam, houckgeest, s, 1797, book, european, interest, in, the, chinese, sailing, carriage, is, also, seen, in, the, writings, of, andreas, everardus, van, braam, houckgeest, in, 1797, who, wrote, near, the, southern, border, of, shandong, one, finds, a, kind, of, wheelbarrow, much, larger, than, that, which, i, have, been, describing, and, drawn, by, a, horse, or, a, mule, but, judge, by, my, surprise, when, today, i, saw, a, whole, fleet, of, wheelbarrows, of, the, same, size, i, say, with, deliberation, a, fleet, for, each, of, them, had, a, sail, mounted, on, a, small, mast, exactly, fixed, in, a, socket, arranged, at, the, forward, end, of, the, barrow, the, sail, made, of, matting, or, more, often, of, cloth, is, five, or, six, feet, 152, or, 183, cm, high, and, three, or, four, feet, 91, or, 122, cm, broad, with, stays, sheets, and, halyards, just, as, on, a, chinese, ship, the, sheets, join, the, shafts, of, the, wheelbarrow, and, can, thus, be, manipulated, by, the, man, in, charge, m, j, t, lewis, surmised, the, wheelbarrow, may, have, existed, in, ancient, greece, in, the, form, of, a, one, wheel, cart, two, building, material, inventories, for, 408, 407, and, 407, 406, b, c, from, the, temple, of, eleusis, list, among, other, machines, and, tools, 1, body, for, a, one, wheeler, hyperteria, monokyklou, although, there, is, no, evidence, to, prove, this, hypothesis, in, greek, since, dikyklos, and, tetrakyklos, mean, nothing, but, two, wheeler, and, four, wheeler, and, since, the, monokyklos, body, is, sandwiched, in, the, eleusis, inventory, between, a, four, wheeler, body, and, its, four, wheels, to, take, it, as, anything, but, a, one, wheeler, strains, credulity, far, beyond, breaking, point, it, can, only, be, a, wheelbarrow, necessarily, guided, and, balanced, by, a, man, what, does, now, emerge, as, certainty, is, that, the, wheelbarrow, did, not, as, is, universally, claimed, make, its, european, debut, in, the, middle, ages, it, was, there, some, sixteen, centuries, before, m, j, t, lewis, admits, that, the, current, consensus, among, technology, historians, including, bertrand, gille, andrea, matthies, and, joseph, needham, is, that, the, wheelbarrow, was, invented, in, china, around, 100, ad, and, spread, to, the, rest, of, world, however, lewis, proposes, that, the, wheelbarrow, could, have, also, existed, in, ancient, greece, based, on, the, eleusis, list, lewis, states, that, it, is, possible, that, wheelbarrows, were, used, on, greek, construction, sites, but, admits, that, evidence, for, the, wheelbarrow, in, ancient, farming, and, mining, is, absent, he, surmised, that, wheelbarrows, were, not, uncommon, on, greek, construction, sites, for, carrying, moderately, light, loads, he, speculates, the, possibility, of, wheelbarrows, in, the, roman, empire, and, the, later, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, although, lewis, concludes, that, the, evidence, is, scarce, and, that, most, of, this, scenario, perforce, is, pure, speculation, the, 4th, century, historia, augusta, reports, emperor, elagabalus, to, have, used, a, wheelbarrow, latin, pabillus, from, pabo, one, wheeled, vehicle, to, transport, women, in, his, frivolous, games, at, court, while, the, present, evidence, does, not, indicate, any, use, of, wheelbarrows, into, medieval, times, the, question, of, continuity, in, the, byzantine, empire, is, still, open, due, to, a, lack, of, research, yet, currently, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, wheelbarrow, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, the, first, wheelbarrows, in, medieval, europe, appeared, sometime, between, 1170, and, 1250, in, contrast, to, the, ones, which, typically, have, a, wheel, in, the, center, of, the, barrow, and, were, preferred, in, china, the, types, mostly, used, in, europe, featured, a, wheel, at, or, near, the, front, the, arrangement, of, most, wheelbarrows, today, research, on, the, early, history, of, the, wheelbarrow, is, made, difficult, by, the, marked, absence, of, a, common, terminology, the, historian, of, technology, m, j, t, lewis, has, identified, in, english, and, french, sources, four, mentions, of, wheelbarrows, between, 1172, and, 1222, three, of, them, designated, with, a, different, term, according, to, the, medieval, art, historian, andrea, matthies, the, first, archival, reference, to, a, wheelbarrow, in, medieval, europe, is, dated, 1222, specifying, the, purchase, of, several, wheelbarrows, for, the, english, king, s, works, at, dover, the, first, depiction, appears, in, an, english, manuscript, matthew, paris, s, vitae, duorum, offarum, completed, in, 1250, by, the, 13th, century, the, wheelbarrow, proved, useful, in, building, construction, mining, operations, and, agriculture, however, going, by, surviving, documents, and, illustrations, the, wheelbarrow, remained, a, relative, rarity, until, the, 15th, century, it, also, seemed, to, be, limited, to, england, france, and, the, low, countries, the, oldest, wheelbarrows, preserved, from, central, europe, were, found, in, 2014, and, 2017, during, archaeological, excavations, in, ingolstadt, germany, the, felling, dates, of, the, trees, that, make, up, the, wheelbarrow, boards, could, be, dendrochronologically, dated, to, 1537, for, one, wheelbarrow, and, the, 1530s, for, the, other, modern, day, wheelbarrows, are, generally, made, from, plastic, or, metal, and, generally, come, with, either, a, pneumatic, tire, semi, pneumatic, tires, or, solid, tire, modern, wheelbarrows, come, in, four, standard, shapes, the, home, gardener, shallow, tray, variety, the, builder, s, barrow, the, square, tray, utility, barrow, and, the, brick, barrow, plastic, wheelbarrows, can, be, beneficial, as, they, are, light, in, weight, reducing, physical, demand, on, the, user, but, plastic, wheelbarrows, are, also, suited, to, lighter, loads, steel, wheel, barrows, can, handle, heavier, loads, with, carrying, capacities, of, up, to, 110, l, 4, cu, ft, wet, or, 160, l, 6, cu, ft, dry, steel, wheelbarrows, more, effectively, transport, heavy, jagged, material, without, damaging, the, wheelbarrow, and, are, often, better, suited, to, construction, applications, in, the, 1970s, british, inventor, james, dyson, introduced, the, ballbarrow, an, injection, molded, plastic, wheelbarrow, with, a, spherical, ball, on, the, front, end, instead, of, a, wheel, compared, to, a, conventional, design, the, larger, surface, area, of, the, ball, made, the, wheelbarrow, easier, to, use, in, soft, soil, and, more, laterally, stable, with, heavy, loads, on, uneven, ground, the, honda, hpe60, an, electric, power, assisted, wheelbarrow, was, produced, in, 1998, power, assisted, wheelbarrows, are, now, widely, available, from, a, number, of, different, manufacturers, powered, wheelbarrows, are, used, in, a, range, of, applications, the, technology, has, improved, to, enable, them, to, take, much, heavier, loads, beyond, weights, that, a, human, could, transport, alone, without, assistance, motorized, wheelbarrows, are, generally, either, diesel, powered, or, electric, battery, powered, often, used, in, small, scale, construction, applications, where, access, for, larger, plant, machinery, might, be, restricted
