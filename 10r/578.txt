a, laser, is, a, device, that, emits, light, through, a, process, of, optical, amplification, based, on, the, stimulated, emission, of, electromagnetic, radiation, the, word, laser, is, an, anacronym, that, originated, as, an, acronym, for, light, amplification, by, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, the, first, laser, was, built, in, 1960, by, theodore, maiman, at, hughes, research, laboratories, based, on, theoretical, work, by, charles, h, townes, and, arthur, leonard, schawlow, a, laser, differs, from, other, sources, of, light, in, that, it, emits, light, that, is, coherent, spatial, coherence, allows, a, laser, to, be, focused, to, a, tight, spot, enabling, applications, such, as, laser, cutting, and, lithography, it, also, allows, a, laser, beam, to, stay, narrow, over, great, distances, collimation, a, feature, used, in, applications, such, as, laser, pointers, and, lidar, light, detection, and, ranging, lasers, can, also, have, high, temporal, coherence, which, permits, them, to, emit, light, with, a, very, narrow, frequency, spectrum, alternatively, temporal, coherence, can, be, used, to, produce, ultrashort, pulses, of, light, with, a, broad, spectrum, but, durations, as, short, as, a, femtosecond, lasers, are, used, in, optical, disc, drives, laser, printers, barcode, scanners, dna, sequencing, instruments, fiber, optic, and, free, space, optical, communication, semiconducting, chip, manufacturing, photolithography, laser, surgery, and, skin, treatments, cutting, and, welding, materials, military, and, law, enforcement, devices, for, marking, targets, and, measuring, range, and, speed, and, in, laser, lighting, displays, for, entertainment, semiconductor, lasers, in, the, blue, to, near, uv, have, also, been, used, in, place, of, light, emitting, diodes, leds, to, excite, fluorescence, as, a, white, light, source, this, permits, a, much, smaller, emitting, area, due, to, the, much, greater, radiance, of, a, laser, and, avoids, the, droop, suffered, by, leds, such, devices, are, already, used, in, some, car, headlamps, the, first, device, using, amplification, by, stimulated, emission, operated, at, microwave, frequencies, and, was, called, a, maser, for, microwave, amplification, by, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, when, similar, optical, devices, were, developed, they, were, first, known, as, optical, masers, until, microwave, was, replaced, by, light, in, the, acronym, to, become, laser, today, all, such, devices, operating, at, frequencies, higher, than, microwaves, approximately, above, 300, ghz, are, called, lasers, e, g, infrared, lasers, ultraviolet, lasers, x, ray, lasers, gamma, ray, lasers, whereas, devices, operating, at, microwave, or, lower, radio, frequencies, are, called, masers, the, back, formed, verb, to, lase, is, frequently, used, in, the, field, meaning, to, give, off, coherent, light, especially, about, the, gain, medium, of, a, laser, when, a, laser, is, operating, it, is, said, to, be, lasing, the, terms, laser, and, maser, are, also, used, for, naturally, occurring, coherent, emissions, as, in, astrophysical, maser, and, atom, laser, a, laser, that, produces, light, by, itself, is, technically, an, optical, oscillator, rather, than, an, optical, amplifier, as, suggested, by, the, acronym, it, has, been, humorously, noted, that, the, acronym, loser, for, light, oscillation, by, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, would, have, been, more, correct, with, the, widespread, use, of, the, original, acronym, as, a, common, noun, optical, amplifiers, have, come, to, be, referred, to, as, laser, amplifiers, modern, physics, describes, light, and, other, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, as, the, group, behavior, of, fundamental, particles, known, as, photons, photons, are, released, and, absorbed, through, electromagnetic, interactions, with, other, fundamental, particles, that, carry, electric, charge, a, common, way, to, release, photons, is, to, heat, an, object, some, of, the, thermal, energy, being, applied, to, the, object, will, cause, the, molecules, and, electrons, within, the, object, to, gain, energy, which, is, then, lost, through, thermal, radiation, that, we, see, as, light, this, is, the, process, that, causes, a, candle, flame, to, give, off, light, thermal, radiation, is, a, random, process, and, thus, the, photons, emitted, have, a, range, of, different, wavelengths, travel, in, different, directions, and, are, released, at, different, times, the, energy, within, the, object, is, not, random, however, it, is, stored, by, atoms, and, molecules, in, excited, states, which, release, photons, with, distinct, wavelengths, this, gives, rise, to, the, science, of, spectroscopy, which, allows, materials, to, be, determined, through, the, specific, wavelengths, that, they, emit, the, underlying, physical, process, creating, photons, in, a, laser, is, the, same, as, in, thermal, radiation, but, the, actual, emission, is, not, the, result, of, random, thermal, processes, instead, the, release, of, a, photon, is, triggered, by, the, nearby, passage, of, another, photon, this, is, called, stimulated, emission, for, this, process, to, work, the, passing, photon, must, be, similar, in, energy, and, thus, wavelength, to, the, one, that, could, be, released, by, the, atom, or, molecule, and, the, atom, or, molecule, must, be, in, the, suitable, excited, state, the, photon, that, is, emitted, by, stimulated, emission, is, identical, to, the, photon, that, triggered, its, emission, and, both, photons, can, go, on, to, trigger, stimulated, emission, in, other, atoms, creating, the, possibility, of, a, chain, reaction, for, this, to, happen, many, of, the, atoms, or, molecules, must, be, in, the, proper, excited, state, so, that, the, photons, can, trigger, them, in, most, materials, atoms, or, molecules, drop, out, of, excited, states, fairly, rapidly, making, it, difficult, or, impossible, to, produce, a, chain, reaction, the, materials, chosen, for, lasers, are, the, ones, that, have, metastable, states, which, stay, excited, for, a, relatively, long, time, in, laser, physics, such, a, material, is, called, an, active, laser, medium, combined, with, an, energy, source, that, continues, to, pump, energy, into, the, material, this, makes, it, possible, to, have, enough, atoms, or, molecules, in, an, excited, state, for, a, chain, reaction, to, develop, lasers, are, distinguished, from, other, light, sources, by, their, coherence, spatial, or, transverse, coherence, is, typically, expressed, through, the, output, being, a, narrow, beam, which, is, diffraction, limited, laser, beams, can, be, focused, to, very, tiny, spots, achieving, a, very, high, irradiance, or, they, can, have, a, very, low, divergence, to, concentrate, their, power, at, a, great, distance, temporal, or, longitudinal, coherence, implies, a, polarized, wave, at, a, single, frequency, whose, phase, is, correlated, over, a, relatively, great, distance, the, coherence, length, along, the, beam, a, beam, produced, by, a, thermal, or, other, incoherent, light, source, has, an, instantaneous, amplitude, and, phase, that, vary, randomly, with, respect, to, time, and, position, thus, having, a, short, coherence, length, lasers, are, characterized, according, to, their, wavelength, in, a, vacuum, most, single, wavelength, lasers, produce, radiation, in, several, modes, with, slightly, different, wavelengths, although, temporal, coherence, implies, some, degree, of, monochromaticity, some, lasers, emit, a, broad, spectrum, of, light, or, emit, different, wavelengths, of, light, simultaneously, certain, lasers, are, not, single, spatial, mode, and, have, light, beams, that, diverge, more, than, is, required, by, the, diffraction, limit, all, such, devices, are, classified, as, lasers, based, on, the, method, of, producing, light, by, stimulated, emission, lasers, are, employed, where, light, of, the, required, spatial, or, temporal, coherence, can, not, be, produced, using, simpler, technologies, a, laser, consists, of, a, gain, medium, a, mechanism, to, energize, it, and, something, to, provide, optical, feedback, the, gain, medium, is, a, material, with, properties, that, allow, it, to, amplify, light, by, way, of, stimulated, emission, light, of, a, specific, wavelength, that, passes, through, the, gain, medium, is, amplified, power, increases, feedback, enables, stimulated, emission, to, amplify, predominantly, the, optical, frequency, at, the, peak, of, the, gain, frequency, curve, as, stimulated, emission, grows, eventually, one, frequency, dominates, over, all, others, meaning, that, a, coherent, beam, has, been, formed, the, process, of, stimulated, emission, is, analogous, to, that, of, an, audio, oscillator, with, positive, feedback, which, can, occur, for, example, when, the, speaker, in, a, public, address, system, is, placed, in, proximity, to, the, microphone, the, screech, one, hears, is, audio, oscillation, at, the, peak, of, the, gain, frequency, curve, for, the, amplifier, for, the, gain, medium, to, amplify, light, it, needs, to, be, supplied, with, energy, in, a, process, called, pumping, the, energy, is, typically, supplied, as, an, electric, current, or, as, light, at, a, different, wavelength, pump, light, may, be, provided, by, a, flash, lamp, or, by, another, laser, the, most, common, type, of, laser, uses, feedback, from, an, optical, cavity, a, pair, of, mirrors, on, either, end, of, the, gain, medium, light, bounces, back, and, forth, between, the, mirrors, passing, through, the, gain, medium, and, being, amplified, each, time, typically, one, of, the, two, mirrors, the, output, coupler, is, partially, transparent, some, of, the, light, escapes, through, this, mirror, depending, on, the, design, of, the, cavity, whether, the, mirrors, are, flat, or, curved, the, light, coming, out, of, the, laser, may, spread, out, or, form, a, narrow, beam, in, analogy, to, electronic, oscillators, this, device, is, sometimes, called, a, laser, oscillator, most, practical, lasers, contain, additional, elements, that, affect, the, properties, of, the, emitted, light, such, as, the, polarization, wavelength, and, shape, of, the, beam, electrons, and, how, they, interact, with, electromagnetic, fields, are, important, in, our, understanding, of, chemistry, and, physics, in, the, classical, view, the, energy, of, an, electron, orbiting, an, atomic, nucleus, is, larger, for, orbits, further, from, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, however, quantum, mechanical, effects, force, electrons, to, take, on, discrete, positions, in, orbitals, thus, electrons, are, found, in, specific, energy, levels, of, an, atom, two, of, which, are, shown, below, an, electron, in, an, atom, can, absorb, energy, from, light, photons, or, heat, phonons, only, if, there, is, a, transition, between, energy, levels, that, match, the, energy, carried, by, the, photon, or, phonon, for, light, this, means, that, any, given, transition, will, only, absorb, one, particular, wavelength, of, light, photons, with, the, correct, wavelength, can, cause, an, electron, to, jump, from, the, lower, to, the, higher, energy, level, the, photon, is, consumed, in, this, process, when, an, electron, is, excited, from, one, state, to, that, at, a, higher, energy, level, with, energy, difference, e, it, will, not, stay, that, way, forever, eventually, a, photon, will, be, spontaneously, created, from, the, vacuum, having, energy, e, conserving, energy, the, electron, transitions, to, a, lower, energy, level, that, is, not, occupied, with, transitions, to, different, levels, having, different, time, constants, this, process, is, called, spontaneous, emission, spontaneous, emission, is, a, quantum, mechanical, effect, and, a, direct, physical, manifestation, of, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, the, emitted, photon, has, a, random, direction, but, its, wavelength, matches, the, absorption, wavelength, of, the, transition, this, is, the, mechanism, of, fluorescence, and, thermal, emission, a, photon, with, the, correct, wavelength, to, be, absorbed, by, a, transition, can, also, cause, an, electron, to, drop, from, the, higher, to, the, lower, level, emitting, a, new, photon, the, emitted, photon, exactly, matches, the, original, photon, in, wavelength, phase, and, direction, this, process, is, called, stimulated, emission, the, gain, medium, is, put, into, an, excited, state, by, an, external, source, of, energy, in, most, lasers, this, medium, consists, of, a, population, of, atoms, that, have, been, excited, into, such, a, state, using, an, outside, light, source, or, an, electrical, field, that, supplies, energy, for, atoms, to, absorb, and, be, transformed, into, their, excited, states, the, gain, medium, of, a, laser, is, normally, a, material, of, controlled, purity, size, concentration, and, shape, which, amplifies, the, beam, by, the, process, of, stimulated, emission, described, above, this, material, can, be, of, any, state, gas, liquid, solid, or, plasma, the, gain, medium, absorbs, pump, energy, which, raises, some, electrons, into, higher, energy, excited, quantum, states, particles, can, interact, with, light, by, either, absorbing, or, emitting, photons, emission, can, be, spontaneous, or, stimulated, in, the, latter, case, the, photon, is, emitted, in, the, same, direction, as, the, light, that, is, passing, by, when, the, number, of, particles, in, one, excited, state, exceeds, the, number, of, particles, in, some, lower, energy, state, population, inversion, is, achieved, in, this, state, the, rate, of, stimulated, emission, is, larger, than, the, rate, of, absorption, of, light, in, the, medium, and, therefore, the, light, is, amplified, a, system, with, this, property, is, called, an, optical, amplifier, when, an, optical, amplifier, is, placed, inside, a, resonant, optical, cavity, one, obtains, a, laser, for, lasing, media, with, extremely, high, gain, so, called, superluminescence, light, can, be, sufficiently, amplified, in, a, single, pass, through, the, gain, medium, without, requiring, a, resonator, although, often, referred, to, as, a, laser, see, for, example, nitrogen, laser, the, light, output, from, such, a, device, lacks, the, spatial, and, temporal, coherence, achievable, with, lasers, such, a, device, cannot, be, described, as, an, oscillator, but, rather, as, a, high, gain, optical, amplifier, that, amplifies, its, spontaneous, emission, the, same, mechanism, describes, so, called, astrophysical, masers, lasers, the, optical, resonator, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, an, optical, cavity, but, this, is, a, misnomer, lasers, use, open, resonators, as, opposed, to, the, literal, cavity, that, would, be, employed, at, microwave, frequencies, in, a, maser, the, resonator, typically, consists, of, two, mirrors, between, which, a, coherent, beam, of, light, travels, in, both, directions, reflecting, on, itself, so, that, an, average, photon, will, pass, through, the, gain, medium, repeatedly, before, it, is, emitted, from, the, output, aperture, or, lost, to, diffraction, or, absorption, if, the, gain, amplification, in, the, medium, is, larger, than, the, resonator, losses, then, the, power, of, the, recirculating, light, can, rise, exponentially, but, each, stimulated, emission, event, returns, an, atom, from, its, excited, state, to, the, ground, state, reducing, the, gain, of, the, medium, with, increasing, beam, power, the, net, gain, gain, minus, loss, reduces, to, unity, and, the, gain, medium, is, said, to, be, saturated, in, a, continuous, wave, cw, laser, the, balance, of, pump, power, against, gain, saturation, and, cavity, losses, produces, an, equilibrium, value, of, the, laser, power, inside, the, cavity, this, equilibrium, determines, the, operating, point, of, the, laser, if, the, applied, pump, power, is, too, small, the, gain, will, never, be, sufficient, to, overcome, the, cavity, losses, and, laser, light, will, not, be, produced, the, minimum, pump, power, needed, to, begin, laser, action, is, called, the, lasing, threshold, the, gain, medium, will, amplify, any, photons, passing, through, it, regardless, of, direction, but, only, the, photons, in, a, spatial, mode, supported, by, the, resonator, will, pass, more, than, once, through, the, medium, and, receive, substantial, amplification, in, most, lasers, lasing, begins, with, spontaneous, emission, into, the, lasing, mode, this, initial, light, is, then, amplified, by, stimulated, emission, in, the, gain, medium, stimulated, emission, produces, light, that, matches, the, input, signal, in, direction, wavelength, and, polarization, whereas, the, phase, of, the, emitted, light, is, 90, degrees, in, lead, of, the, stimulating, light, this, combined, with, the, filtering, effect, of, the, optical, resonator, gives, laser, light, its, characteristic, coherence, and, may, give, it, uniform, polarization, and, monochromaticity, depending, on, the, resonator, s, design, the, fundamental, laser, linewidth, of, light, emitted, from, the, lasing, resonator, can, be, orders, of, magnitude, narrower, than, the, linewidth, of, light, emitted, from, the, passive, resonator, some, lasers, use, a, separate, injection, seeder, to, start, the, process, off, with, a, beam, that, is, already, highly, coherent, this, can, produce, beams, with, a, narrower, spectrum, than, would, otherwise, be, possible, in, 1963, roy, j, glauber, showed, that, coherent, states, are, formed, from, combinations, of, photon, number, states, for, which, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, a, coherent, beam, of, light, is, formed, by, single, frequency, quantum, photon, states, distributed, according, to, a, poisson, distribution, as, a, result, the, arrival, rate, of, photons, in, a, laser, beam, is, described, by, poisson, statistics, many, lasers, produce, a, beam, that, can, be, approximated, as, a, gaussian, beam, such, beams, have, the, minimum, divergence, possible, for, a, given, beam, diameter, some, lasers, particularly, high, power, ones, produce, multimode, beams, with, the, transverse, modes, often, approximated, using, hermite, gaussian, or, laguerre, gaussian, functions, some, high, power, lasers, use, a, flat, topped, profile, known, as, a, tophat, beam, unstable, laser, resonators, not, used, in, most, lasers, produce, fractal, shaped, beams, specialized, optical, systems, can, produce, more, complex, beam, geometries, such, as, bessel, beams, and, optical, vortexes, near, the, waist, or, focal, region, of, a, laser, beam, it, is, highly, collimated, the, wavefronts, are, planar, normal, to, the, direction, of, propagation, with, no, beam, divergence, at, that, point, however, due, to, diffraction, that, can, only, remain, true, well, within, the, rayleigh, range, the, beam, of, a, single, transverse, mode, gaussian, beam, laser, eventually, diverges, at, an, angle, that, varies, inversely, with, the, beam, diameter, as, required, by, diffraction, theory, thus, the, pencil, beam, directly, generated, by, a, common, helium, neon, laser, would, spread, out, to, a, size, of, perhaps, 500, kilometers, when, shone, on, the, moon, from, the, distance, of, the, earth, on, the, other, hand, the, light, from, a, semiconductor, laser, typically, exits, the, tiny, crystal, with, a, large, divergence, up, to, 50, however, even, such, a, divergent, beam, can, be, transformed, into, a, similarly, collimated, beam, employing, a, lens, system, as, is, always, included, for, instance, in, a, laser, pointer, whose, light, originates, from, a, laser, diode, that, is, possible, due, to, the, light, being, of, a, single, spatial, mode, this, unique, property, of, laser, light, spatial, coherence, cannot, be, replicated, using, standard, light, sources, except, by, discarding, most, of, the, light, as, can, be, appreciated, by, comparing, the, beam, from, a, flashlight, torch, or, spotlight, to, that, of, almost, any, laser, a, laser, beam, profiler, is, used, to, measure, the, intensity, profile, width, and, divergence, of, laser, beams, diffuse, reflection, of, a, laser, beam, from, a, matte, surface, produces, a, speckle, pattern, with, interesting, properties, the, mechanism, of, producing, radiation, in, a, laser, relies, on, stimulated, emission, where, energy, is, extracted, from, a, transition, in, an, atom, or, molecule, this, is, a, quantum, phenomenon, that, was, predicted, by, albert, einstein, who, derived, the, relationship, between, the, a, coefficient, describing, spontaneous, emission, and, the, b, coefficient, which, applies, to, absorption, and, stimulated, emission, however, in, the, case, of, the, free, electron, laser, atomic, energy, levels, are, not, involved, it, appears, that, the, operation, of, this, rather, exotic, device, can, be, explained, without, reference, to, quantum, mechanics, a, laser, can, be, classified, as, operating, in, either, continuous, or, pulsed, mode, depending, on, whether, the, power, output, is, essentially, continuous, over, time, or, whether, its, output, takes, the, form, of, pulses, of, light, on, one, or, another, time, scale, of, course, even, a, laser, whose, output, is, normally, continuous, can, be, intentionally, turned, on, and, off, at, some, rate, to, create, pulses, of, light, when, the, modulation, rate, is, on, time, scales, much, slower, than, the, cavity, lifetime, and, the, period, over, which, energy, can, be, stored, in, the, lasing, medium, or, pumping, mechanism, then, it, is, still, classified, as, a, modulated, or, pulsed, continuous, wave, laser, most, laser, diodes, used, in, communication, systems, fall, into, that, category, some, applications, of, lasers, depend, on, a, beam, whose, output, power, is, constant, over, time, such, a, laser, is, known, as, continuous, wave, cw, laser, many, types, of, lasers, can, be, made, to, operate, in, continuous, wave, mode, to, satisfy, such, an, application, many, of, these, lasers, lase, in, several, longitudinal, modes, at, the, same, time, and, beats, between, the, slightly, different, optical, frequencies, of, those, oscillations, will, produce, amplitude, variations, on, time, scales, shorter, than, the, round, trip, time, the, reciprocal, of, the, frequency, spacing, between, modes, typically, a, few, nanoseconds, or, less, in, most, cases, these, lasers, are, still, termed, continuous, wave, as, their, output, power, is, steady, when, averaged, over, longer, periods, with, the, very, high, frequency, power, variations, having, little, or, no, impact, on, the, intended, application, however, the, term, is, not, applied, to, mode, locked, lasers, where, the, intention, is, to, create, very, short, pulses, at, the, rate, of, the, round, trip, time, for, continuous, wave, operation, it, is, required, for, the, population, inversion, of, the, gain, medium, to, be, continually, replenished, by, a, steady, pump, source, in, some, lasing, media, this, is, impossible, in, some, other, lasers, it, would, require, pumping, the, laser, at, a, very, high, continuous, power, level, which, would, be, impractical, or, destroying, the, laser, by, producing, excessive, heat, such, lasers, cannot, be, run, in, cw, mode, the, pulsed, operation, of, lasers, refers, to, any, laser, not, classified, as, a, continuous, wave, so, that, the, optical, power, appears, in, pulses, of, some, duration, at, some, repetition, rate, this, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, technologies, addressing, many, different, motivations, some, lasers, are, pulsed, simply, because, they, cannot, be, run, in, continuous, mode, in, other, cases, the, application, requires, the, production, of, pulses, having, as, large, an, energy, as, possible, since, the, pulse, energy, is, equal, to, the, average, power, divided, by, the, repetition, rate, this, goal, can, sometimes, be, satisfied, by, lowering, the, rate, of, pulses, so, that, more, energy, can, be, built, up, between, pulses, in, laser, ablation, for, example, a, small, volume, of, material, at, the, surface, of, a, workpiece, can, be, evaporated, if, it, is, heated, in, a, very, short, time, while, supplying, the, energy, gradually, would, allow, for, the, heat, to, be, absorbed, into, the, bulk, of, the, piece, never, attaining, a, sufficiently, high, temperature, at, a, particular, point, other, applications, rely, on, the, peak, pulse, power, rather, than, the, energy, in, the, pulse, especially, to, obtain, nonlinear, optical, effects, for, a, given, pulse, energy, this, requires, creating, pulses, of, the, shortest, possible, duration, utilizing, techniques, such, as, q, switching, the, optical, bandwidth, of, a, pulse, cannot, be, narrower, than, the, reciprocal, of, the, pulse, width, in, the, case, of, extremely, short, pulses, that, implies, lasing, over, a, considerable, bandwidth, quite, contrary, to, the, very, narrow, bandwidths, typical, of, cw, lasers, the, lasing, medium, in, some, dye, lasers, and, vibronic, solid, state, lasers, produces, optical, gain, over, a, wide, bandwidth, making, a, laser, possible, that, can, thus, generate, pulses, of, light, as, short, as, a, few, femtoseconds, 10, 15, s, in, a, q, switched, laser, the, population, inversion, is, allowed, to, build, up, by, introducing, loss, inside, the, resonator, which, exceeds, the, gain, of, the, medium, this, can, also, be, described, as, a, reduction, of, the, quality, factor, or, q, of, the, cavity, then, after, the, pump, energy, stored, in, the, laser, medium, has, approached, the, maximum, possible, level, the, introduced, loss, mechanism, often, an, electro, or, acousto, optical, element, is, rapidly, removed, or, that, occurs, by, itself, in, a, passive, device, allowing, lasing, to, begin, which, rapidly, obtains, the, stored, energy, in, the, gain, medium, this, results, in, a, short, pulse, incorporating, that, energy, and, thus, a, high, peak, power, a, mode, locked, laser, is, capable, of, emitting, extremely, short, pulses, on, the, order, of, tens, of, picoseconds, down, to, less, than, 10, femtoseconds, these, pulses, repeat, at, the, round, trip, time, that, is, the, time, that, it, takes, light, to, complete, one, round, trip, between, the, mirrors, comprising, the, resonator, due, to, the, fourier, limit, also, known, as, energy, time, uncertainty, a, pulse, of, such, short, temporal, length, has, a, spectrum, spread, over, a, considerable, bandwidth, thus, such, a, gain, medium, must, have, a, gain, bandwidth, sufficiently, broad, to, amplify, those, frequencies, an, example, of, a, suitable, material, is, titanium, doped, artificially, grown, sapphire, ti, sapphire, which, has, a, very, wide, gain, bandwidth, and, can, thus, produce, pulses, of, only, a, few, femtoseconds, duration, such, mode, locked, lasers, are, a, most, versatile, tool, for, researching, processes, occurring, on, extremely, short, time, scales, known, as, femtosecond, physics, femtosecond, chemistry, and, ultrafast, science, for, maximizing, the, effect, of, nonlinearity, in, optical, materials, e, g, in, second, harmonic, generation, parametric, down, conversion, optical, parametric, oscillators, and, the, like, unlike, the, giant, pulse, of, a, q, switched, laser, consecutive, pulses, from, a, mode, locked, laser, are, phase, coherent, that, is, the, pulses, and, not, just, their, envelopes, are, identical, and, perfectly, periodic, for, this, reason, and, the, extremely, large, peak, powers, attained, by, such, short, pulses, such, lasers, are, invaluable, in, certain, areas, of, research, another, method, of, achieving, pulsed, laser, operation, is, to, pump, the, laser, material, with, a, source, that, is, itself, pulsed, either, through, electronic, charging, in, the, case, of, flash, lamps, or, another, laser, that, is, already, pulsed, pulsed, pumping, was, historically, used, with, dye, lasers, where, the, inverted, population, lifetime, of, a, dye, molecule, was, so, short, that, a, high, energy, fast, pump, was, needed, the, way, to, overcome, this, problem, was, to, charge, up, large, capacitors, which, are, then, switched, to, discharge, through, flashlamps, producing, an, intense, flash, pulsed, pumping, is, also, required, for, three, level, lasers, in, which, the, lower, energy, level, rapidly, becomes, highly, populated, preventing, further, lasing, until, those, atoms, relax, to, the, ground, state, these, lasers, such, as, the, excimer, laser, and, the, copper, vapor, laser, can, never, be, operated, in, cw, mode, in, 1917, albert, einstein, established, the, theoretical, foundations, for, the, laser, and, the, maser, in, the, paper, zur, quantentheorie, der, strahlung, on, the, quantum, theory, of, radiation, via, a, re, derivation, of, max, planck, s, law, of, radiation, conceptually, based, upon, probability, coefficients, einstein, coefficients, for, the, absorption, spontaneous, emission, and, stimulated, emission, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, 1928, rudolf, w, ladenburg, confirmed, the, existence, of, the, phenomena, of, stimulated, emission, and, negative, absorption, in, 1939, valentin, a, fabrikant, predicted, the, use, of, stimulated, emission, to, amplify, short, waves, in, 1947, willis, e, lamb, and, r, c, retherford, found, apparent, stimulated, emission, in, hydrogen, spectra, and, effected, the, first, demonstration, of, stimulated, emission, in, 1950, alfred, kastler, nobel, prize, for, physics, 1966, proposed, the, method, of, optical, pumping, which, was, experimentally, demonstrated, two, years, later, by, brossel, kastler, and, winter, in, 1951, joseph, weber, submitted, a, paper, on, using, stimulated, emissions, to, make, a, microwave, amplifier, to, the, june, 1952, institute, of, radio, engineers, vacuum, tube, research, conference, at, ottawa, ontario, canada, after, this, presentation, rca, asked, weber, to, give, a, seminar, on, this, idea, and, charles, h, townes, asked, him, for, a, copy, of, the, paper, in, 1953, charles, h, townes, and, graduate, students, james, p, gordon, and, herbert, j, zeiger, produced, the, first, microwave, amplifier, a, device, operating, on, similar, principles, to, the, laser, but, amplifying, microwave, radiation, rather, than, infrared, or, visible, radiation, townes, s, maser, was, incapable, of, continuous, output, meanwhile, in, the, soviet, union, nikolay, basov, and, aleksandr, prokhorov, were, independently, working, on, the, quantum, oscillator, and, solved, the, problem, of, continuous, output, systems, by, using, more, than, two, energy, levels, these, gain, media, could, release, stimulated, emissions, between, an, excited, state, and, a, lower, excited, state, not, the, ground, state, facilitating, the, maintenance, of, a, population, inversion, in, 1955, prokhorov, and, basov, suggested, optical, pumping, of, a, multi, level, system, as, a, method, for, obtaining, the, population, inversion, later, a, main, method, of, laser, pumping, townes, reports, that, several, eminent, physicists, among, them, niels, bohr, john, von, neumann, and, llewellyn, thomas, argued, the, maser, violated, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, and, hence, could, not, work, others, such, as, isidor, rabi, and, polykarp, kusch, expected, that, it, would, be, impractical, and, not, worth, the, effort, in, 1964, charles, h, townes, nikolay, basov, and, aleksandr, prokhorov, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, fundamental, work, in, the, field, of, quantum, electronics, which, has, led, to, the, construction, of, oscillators, and, amplifiers, based, on, the, maser, laser, principle, in, april, 1957, japanese, engineer, jun, ichi, nishizawa, proposed, the, concept, of, a, semiconductor, optical, maser, in, a, patent, application, that, same, year, charles, h, townes, and, arthur, leonard, schawlow, then, at, bell, labs, began, a, serious, study, of, infrared, optical, masers, as, ideas, developed, they, abandoned, infrared, radiation, to, instead, concentrate, on, visible, light, in, 1958, bell, labs, filed, a, patent, application, for, their, proposed, optical, maser, and, schawlow, and, townes, submitted, a, manuscript, of, their, theoretical, calculations, to, the, physical, review, which, was, published, in, 1958, simultaneously, columbia, university, graduate, student, gordon, gould, was, working, on, a, doctoral, thesis, about, the, energy, levels, of, excited, thallium, when, gould, and, townes, met, they, spoke, of, radiation, emission, as, a, general, subject, afterward, in, november, 1957, gould, noted, his, ideas, for, a, laser, including, using, an, open, resonator, later, an, essential, laser, device, component, moreover, in, 1958, prokhorov, independently, proposed, using, an, open, resonator, the, first, published, appearance, of, this, idea, meanwhile, schawlow, and, townes, had, decided, on, an, open, resonator, laser, design, apparently, unaware, of, prokhorov, s, publications, and, gould, s, unpublished, laser, work, at, a, conference, in, 1959, gordon, gould, first, published, the, acronym, laser, in, the, paper, the, laser, light, amplification, by, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, gould, s, intention, was, that, different, aser, acronyms, should, be, used, for, different, parts, of, the, spectrum, xaser, for, x, rays, uvaser, for, ultraviolet, etc, laser, ended, up, becoming, the, generic, term, for, non, microwave, devices, although, raser, was, briefly, popular, for, denoting, radio, frequency, emitting, devices, gould, s, notes, included, possible, applications, for, a, laser, such, as, spectrometry, interferometry, radar, and, nuclear, fusion, he, continued, developing, the, idea, and, filed, a, patent, application, in, april, 1959, the, united, states, patent, and, trademark, office, uspto, denied, his, application, and, awarded, a, patent, to, bell, labs, in, 1960, that, provoked, a, twenty, eight, year, lawsuit, featuring, scientific, prestige, and, money, as, the, stakes, gould, won, his, first, minor, patent, in, 1977, yet, it, was, not, until, 1987, that, he, won, the, first, significant, patent, lawsuit, victory, when, a, federal, judge, ordered, the, uspto, to, issue, patents, to, gould, for, the, optically, pumped, and, the, gas, discharge, laser, devices, the, question, of, just, how, to, assign, credit, for, inventing, the, laser, remains, unresolved, by, historians, on, may, 16, 1960, theodore, h, maiman, operated, the, first, functioning, laser, at, hughes, research, laboratories, malibu, california, ahead, of, several, research, teams, including, those, of, townes, at, columbia, university, arthur, l, schawlow, at, bell, labs, and, gould, at, the, trg, technical, research, group, company, maiman, s, functional, laser, used, a, flashlamp, pumped, synthetic, ruby, crystal, to, produce, red, laser, light, at, 694, nanometers, wavelength, the, device, was, only, capable, of, pulsed, operation, due, to, its, three, level, pumping, design, scheme, later, that, year, the, iranian, physicist, ali, javan, and, william, r, bennett, jr, and, donald, r, herriott, constructed, the, first, gas, laser, using, helium, and, neon, that, was, capable, of, continuous, operation, in, the, infrared, u, s, patent, 3, 149, 290, later, javan, received, the, albert, einstein, world, award, of, science, in, 1993, in, 1962, robert, n, hall, demonstrated, the, first, semiconductor, laser, which, was, made, of, gallium, arsenide, and, emitted, in, the, near, infrared, band, of, the, spectrum, at, 850, nm, later, that, year, nick, holonyak, jr, demonstrated, the, first, semiconductor, laser, with, a, visible, emission, this, first, semiconductor, laser, could, only, be, used, in, pulsed, beam, operation, and, when, cooled, to, liquid, nitrogen, temperatures, 77, k, in, 1970, zhores, alferov, in, the, ussr, and, izuo, hayashi, and, morton, panish, of, bell, labs, also, independently, developed, room, temperature, continual, operation, diode, lasers, using, the, heterojunction, structure, since, the, early, period, of, laser, history, laser, research, has, produced, a, variety, of, improved, and, specialized, laser, types, optimized, for, different, performance, goals, including, and, this, research, continues, to, this, day, in, 2015, researchers, made, a, white, laser, whose, light, is, modulated, by, a, synthetic, nanosheet, made, out, of, zinc, cadmium, sulfur, and, selenium, that, can, emit, red, green, and, blue, light, in, varying, proportions, with, each, wavelength, spanning, 191, nm, in, 2017, researchers, at, the, delft, university, of, technology, demonstrated, an, ac, josephson, junction, microwave, laser, since, the, laser, operates, in, the, superconducting, regime, it, is, more, stable, than, other, semiconductor, based, lasers, the, device, has, the, potential, for, applications, in, quantum, computing, in, 2017, researchers, at, the, technical, university, of, munich, demonstrated, the, smallest, mode, locking, laser, capable, of, emitting, pairs, of, phase, locked, picosecond, laser, pulses, with, a, repetition, frequency, up, to, 200, ghz, in, 2017, researchers, from, the, physikalisch, technische, bundesanstalt, ptb, together, with, us, researchers, from, jila, a, joint, institute, of, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, and, the, university, of, colorado, boulder, established, a, new, world, record, by, developing, an, erbium, doped, fiber, laser, with, a, linewidth, of, only, 10, millihertz, following, the, invention, of, the, hene, gas, laser, many, other, gas, discharges, have, been, found, to, amplify, light, coherently, gas, lasers, using, many, different, gases, have, been, built, and, used, for, many, purposes, the, helium, neon, laser, hene, can, operate, at, many, different, wavelengths, however, the, vast, majority, are, engineered, to, lase, at, 633, nm, these, relatively, low, cost, but, highly, coherent, lasers, are, extremely, common, in, optical, research, and, educational, laboratories, commercial, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, lasers, can, emit, many, hundreds, of, watts, in, a, single, spatial, mode, which, can, be, concentrated, into, a, tiny, spot, this, emission, is, in, the, thermal, infrared, at, 10, 6, m, such, lasers, are, regularly, used, in, industry, for, cutting, and, welding, the, efficiency, of, a, co, 2, laser, is, unusually, high, over, 30, argon, ion, lasers, can, operate, at, several, lasing, transitions, between, 351, and, 528, 7, nm, depending, on, the, optical, design, one, or, more, of, these, transitions, can, be, lasing, simultaneously, the, most, commonly, used, lines, are, 458, nm, 488, nm, and, 514, 5, nm, a, nitrogen, transverse, electrical, discharge, in, gas, at, atmospheric, pressure, tea, laser, is, an, inexpensive, gas, laser, often, home, built, by, hobbyists, which, produces, rather, incoherent, uv, light, at, 337, 1, nm, metal, ion, lasers, are, gas, lasers, that, generate, deep, ultraviolet, wavelengths, helium, silver, heag, 224, nm, and, neon, copper, necu, 248, nm, are, two, examples, like, all, low, pressure, gas, lasers, the, gain, media, of, these, lasers, have, quite, narrow, oscillation, linewidths, less, than, 3, ghz, 0, 5, picometers, making, them, candidates, for, use, in, fluorescence, suppressed, raman, spectroscopy, lasing, without, maintaining, the, medium, excited, into, a, population, inversion, was, demonstrated, in, 1992, in, sodium, gas, and, again, in, 1995, in, rubidium, gas, by, various, international, teams, this, was, accomplished, by, using, an, external, maser, to, induce, optical, transparency, in, the, medium, by, introducing, and, destructively, interfering, the, ground, electron, transitions, between, two, paths, so, that, the, likelihood, for, the, ground, electrons, to, absorb, any, energy, has, been, canceled, chemical, lasers, are, powered, by, a, chemical, reaction, permitting, a, large, amount, of, energy, to, be, released, quickly, such, very, high, power, lasers, are, especially, of, interest, to, the, military, however, continuous, wave, chemical, lasers, at, very, high, power, levels, fed, by, streams, of, gasses, have, been, developed, and, have, some, industrial, applications, as, examples, in, the, hydrogen, fluoride, laser, 2700, 2900, nm, and, the, deuterium, fluoride, laser, 3800, nm, the, reaction, is, the, combination, of, hydrogen, or, deuterium, gas, with, combustion, products, of, ethylene, in, nitrogen, trifluoride, excimer, lasers, are, a, special, sort, of, gas, laser, powered, by, an, electric, discharge, in, which, the, lasing, medium, is, an, excimer, or, more, precisely, an, exciplex, in, existing, designs, these, are, molecules, that, can, only, exist, with, one, atom, in, an, excited, electronic, state, once, the, molecule, transfers, its, excitation, energy, to, a, photon, its, atoms, are, no, longer, bound, to, each, other, and, the, molecule, disintegrates, this, drastically, reduces, the, population, of, the, lower, energy, state, thus, greatly, facilitating, a, population, inversion, excimers, currently, used, are, all, noble, gas, compounds, noble, gasses, are, chemically, inert, and, can, only, form, compounds, while, in, an, excited, state, excimer, lasers, typically, operate, at, ultraviolet, wavelengths, with, major, applications, including, semiconductor, photolithography, and, lasik, eye, surgery, commonly, used, excimer, molecules, include, arf, emission, at, 193, nm, krcl, 222, nm, krf, 248, nm, xecl, 308, nm, and, xef, 351, nm, the, molecular, fluorine, laser, emitting, at, 157, nm, in, the, vacuum, ultraviolet, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, an, excimer, laser, however, this, appears, to, be, a, misnomer, since, f, 2, is, a, stable, compound, solid, state, lasers, use, a, crystalline, or, glass, rod, that, is, doped, with, ions, that, provide, the, required, energy, states, for, example, the, first, working, laser, was, a, ruby, laser, made, from, ruby, chromium, doped, corundum, the, population, inversion, is, maintained, in, the, dopant, these, materials, are, pumped, optically, using, a, shorter, wavelength, than, the, lasing, wavelength, often, from, a, flash, tube, or, another, laser, the, usage, of, the, term, solid, state, in, laser, physics, is, narrower, than, in, typical, use, semiconductor, lasers, laser, diodes, are, typically, not, referred, to, as, solid, state, lasers, neodymium, is, a, common, dopant, in, various, solid, state, laser, crystals, including, yttrium, orthovanadate, nd, yvo, 4, yttrium, lithium, fluoride, nd, ylf, and, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, nd, yag, all, these, lasers, can, produce, high, powers, in, the, infrared, spectrum, at, 1064, nm, they, are, used, for, cutting, welding, and, marking, of, metals, and, other, materials, and, also, in, spectroscopy, and, for, pumping, dye, lasers, these, lasers, are, also, commonly, doubled, tripled, or, quadrupled, in, frequency, to, produce, 532, nm, green, visible, 355, nm, and, 266, nm, uv, beams, respectively, frequency, doubled, diode, pumped, solid, state, dpss, lasers, are, used, to, make, bright, green, laser, pointers, ytterbium, holmium, thulium, and, erbium, are, other, common, dopants, in, solid, state, lasers, ytterbium, is, used, in, crystals, such, as, yb, yag, yb, kgw, yb, kyw, yb, sys, yb, boys, yb, caf, 2, typically, operating, around, 1020, 1050, nm, they, are, potentially, very, efficient, and, high, powered, due, to, a, small, quantum, defect, extremely, high, powers, in, ultrashort, pulses, can, be, achieved, with, yb, yag, holmium, doped, yag, crystals, emit, at, 2097, nm, and, form, an, efficient, laser, operating, at, infrared, wavelengths, strongly, absorbed, by, water, bearing, tissues, the, ho, yag, is, usually, operated, in, a, pulsed, mode, and, passed, through, optical, fiber, surgical, devices, to, resurface, joints, remove, rot, from, teeth, vaporize, cancers, and, pulverize, kidney, and, gall, stones, titanium, doped, sapphire, ti, sapphire, produces, a, highly, tunable, infrared, laser, commonly, used, for, spectroscopy, it, is, also, notable, for, use, as, a, mode, locked, laser, producing, ultrashort, pulses, of, extremely, high, peak, power, thermal, limitations, in, solid, state, lasers, arise, from, unconverted, pump, power, that, heats, the, medium, this, heat, when, coupled, with, a, high, thermo, optic, coefficient, d, n, d, t, can, cause, thermal, lensing, and, reduce, the, quantum, efficiency, diode, pumped, thin, disk, lasers, overcome, these, issues, by, having, a, gain, medium, that, is, much, thinner, than, the, diameter, of, the, pump, beam, this, allows, for, a, more, uniform, temperature, in, the, material, thin, disk, lasers, have, been, shown, to, produce, beams, of, up, to, one, kilowatt, solid, state, lasers, or, laser, amplifiers, where, the, light, is, guided, due, to, the, total, internal, reflection, in, a, single, mode, optical, fiber, are, instead, called, fiber, lasers, guiding, of, light, allows, extremely, long, gain, regions, providing, good, cooling, conditions, fibers, have, a, high, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, which, allows, efficient, cooling, in, addition, the, fiber, s, waveguiding, properties, tend, to, reduce, the, thermal, distortion, of, the, beam, erbium, and, ytterbium, ions, are, common, active, species, in, such, lasers, quite, often, the, fiber, laser, is, designed, as, a, double, clad, fiber, this, type, of, fiber, consists, of, a, fiber, core, an, inner, cladding, and, an, outer, cladding, the, index, of, the, three, concentric, layers, is, chosen, so, that, the, fiber, core, acts, as, a, single, mode, fiber, for, the, laser, emission, while, the, outer, cladding, acts, as, a, highly, multimode, core, for, the, pump, laser, this, lets, the, pump, propagate, a, large, amount, of, power, into, and, through, the, active, inner, core, region, while, still, having, a, high, numerical, aperture, na, to, have, easy, launching, conditions, pump, light, can, be, used, more, efficiently, by, creating, a, fiber, disk, laser, or, a, stack, of, such, lasers, fiber, lasers, like, other, optical, media, can, suffer, from, the, effects, of, photodarkening, when, they, are, exposed, to, radiation, of, certain, wavelengths, in, particular, this, can, lead, to, degradation, of, the, material, and, loss, in, laser, functionality, over, time, the, exact, causes, and, effects, of, this, phenomenon, vary, from, material, to, material, although, it, often, involves, the, formation, of, color, centers, photonic, crystal, lasers, are, lasers, based, on, nano, structures, that, provide, the, mode, confinement, and, the, density, of, optical, states, dos, structure, required, for, the, feedback, to, take, place, they, are, typical, micrometer, sized, and, tunable, on, the, bands, of, the, photonic, crystals, semiconductor, lasers, are, diodes, that, are, electrically, pumped, recombination, of, electrons, and, holes, created, by, the, applied, current, introduces, optical, gain, reflection, from, the, ends, of, the, crystal, forms, an, optical, resonator, although, the, resonator, can, be, external, to, the, semiconductor, in, some, designs, commercial, laser, diodes, emit, at, wavelengths, from, 375, nm, to, 3500, nm, low, to, medium, power, laser, diodes, are, used, in, laser, pointers, laser, printers, and, cd, dvd, players, laser, diodes, are, also, frequently, used, to, optically, pump, other, lasers, with, high, efficiency, the, highest, power, industrial, laser, diodes, with, power, of, up, to, 20, kw, are, used, in, industry, for, cutting, and, welding, external, cavity, semiconductor, lasers, have, a, semiconductor, active, medium, in, a, larger, cavity, these, devices, can, generate, high, power, outputs, with, good, beam, quality, wavelength, tunable, narrow, linewidth, radiation, or, ultrashort, laser, pulses, in, 2012, nichia, and, osram, developed, and, manufactured, commercial, high, power, green, laser, diodes, 515, 520, nm, which, compete, with, traditional, diode, pumped, solid, state, lasers, vertical, cavity, surface, emitting, lasers, vcsels, are, semiconductor, lasers, whose, emission, direction, is, perpendicular, to, the, surface, of, the, wafer, vcsel, devices, typically, have, a, more, circular, output, beam, than, conventional, laser, diodes, as, of, 2005, only, 850, nm, vcsels, are, widely, available, with, 1300, nm, vcsels, beginning, to, be, commercialized, and, 1550, nm, devices, an, area, of, research, vecsels, are, external, cavity, vcsels, quantum, cascade, lasers, are, semiconductor, lasers, that, have, an, active, transition, between, energy, sub, bands, of, an, electron, in, a, structure, containing, several, quantum, wells, the, development, of, a, silicon, laser, is, important, in, the, field, of, optical, computing, silicon, is, the, material, of, choice, for, integrated, circuits, and, so, electronic, and, silicon, photonic, components, such, as, optical, interconnects, could, be, fabricated, on, the, same, chip, unfortunately, silicon, is, a, difficult, lasing, material, to, deal, with, since, it, has, certain, properties, which, block, lasing, however, recently, teams, have, produced, silicon, lasers, through, methods, such, as, fabricating, the, lasing, material, from, silicon, and, other, semiconductor, materials, such, as, indium, iii, phosphide, or, gallium, iii, arsenide, materials, that, allow, coherent, light, to, be, produced, from, silicon, these, are, called, hybrid, silicon, laser, recent, developments, have, also, shown, the, use, of, monolithically, integrated, nanowire, lasers, directly, on, silicon, for, optical, interconnects, paving, the, way, for, chip, level, applications, these, heterostructure, nanowire, lasers, capable, of, optical, interconnects, in, silicon, are, also, capable, of, emitting, pairs, of, phase, locked, picosecond, pulses, with, a, repetition, frequency, up, to, 200, ghz, allowing, for, on, chip, optical, signal, processing, another, type, is, a, raman, laser, which, takes, advantage, of, raman, scattering, to, produce, a, laser, from, materials, such, as, silicon, dye, lasers, use, an, organic, dye, as, the, gain, medium, the, wide, gain, spectrum, of, available, dyes, or, mixtures, of, dyes, allows, these, lasers, to, be, highly, tunable, or, to, produce, very, short, duration, pulses, on, the, order, of, a, few, femtoseconds, although, these, tunable, lasers, are, mainly, known, in, their, liquid, form, researchers, have, also, demonstrated, narrow, linewidth, tunable, emission, in, dispersive, oscillator, configurations, incorporating, solid, state, dye, gain, media, in, their, most, prevalent, form, these, solid, state, dye, lasers, use, dye, doped, polymers, as, laser, media, bubble, lasers, are, dye, lasers, that, use, a, bubble, as, the, optical, resonator, whispering, gallery, modes, in, the, bubble, produce, an, output, spectrum, composed, of, hundreds, of, evenly, spaced, peaks, a, frequency, comb, the, spacing, of, the, whispering, gallery, modes, is, directly, related, to, the, bubble, circumference, allowing, bubble, lasers, to, be, used, as, highly, sensitive, pressure, sensors, free, electron, lasers, fel, generate, coherent, high, power, radiation, that, is, widely, tunable, currently, ranging, in, wavelength, from, microwaves, through, terahertz, radiation, and, infrared, to, the, visible, spectrum, to, soft, x, rays, they, have, the, widest, frequency, range, of, any, laser, type, while, fel, beams, share, the, same, optical, traits, as, other, lasers, such, as, coherent, radiation, fel, operation, is, quite, different, unlike, gas, liquid, or, solid, state, lasers, which, rely, on, bound, atomic, or, molecular, states, fels, use, a, relativistic, electron, beam, as, the, lasing, medium, hence, the, term, free, electron, the, pursuit, of, a, high, quantum, energy, laser, using, transitions, between, isomeric, states, of, an, atomic, nucleus, has, been, the, subject, of, wide, ranging, academic, research, since, the, early, 1970s, much, of, this, is, summarized, in, three, review, articles, this, research, has, been, international, in, scope, but, mainly, based, in, the, former, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, while, many, scientists, remain, optimistic, that, a, breakthrough, is, near, an, operational, gamma, ray, laser, is, yet, to, be, realized, some, of, the, early, studies, were, directed, toward, short, pulses, of, neutrons, exciting, the, upper, isomer, state, in, a, solid, so, the, gamma, ray, transition, could, benefit, from, the, line, narrowing, of, m, ssbauer, effect, in, conjunction, several, advantages, were, expected, from, two, stage, pumping, of, a, three, level, system, it, was, conjectured, that, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, embedded, in, the, near, field, of, a, laser, driven, coherently, oscillating, electron, cloud, would, experience, a, larger, dipole, field, than, that, of, the, driving, laser, furthermore, the, nonlinearity, of, the, oscillating, cloud, would, produce, both, spatial, and, temporal, harmonics, so, nuclear, transitions, of, higher, multipolarity, could, also, be, driven, at, multiples, of, the, laser, frequency, in, september, 2007, the, bbc, news, reported, that, there, was, speculation, about, the, possibility, of, using, positronium, annihilation, to, drive, a, very, powerful, gamma, ray, laser, david, cassidy, of, the, university, of, california, riverside, proposed, that, a, single, such, laser, could, be, used, to, ignite, a, nuclear, fusion, reaction, replacing, the, banks, of, hundreds, of, lasers, currently, employed, in, inertial, confinement, fusion, experiments, space, based, x, ray, lasers, pumped, by, a, nuclear, explosion, have, also, been, proposed, as, antimissile, weapons, such, devices, would, be, one, shot, weapons, living, cells, have, been, used, to, produce, laser, light, the, cells, were, genetically, engineered, to, produce, green, fluorescent, protein, which, served, as, the, laser, s, gain, medium, the, cells, were, then, placed, between, two, 20, micrometer, wide, mirrors, which, acted, as, the, laser, cavity, when, the, cell, was, illuminated, with, blue, light, it, emitted, intensely, directed, green, laser, light, like, astrophysical, masers, irradiated, planetary, or, stellar, gases, may, amplify, light, producing, a, natural, laser, mars, venus, and, mwc, 349, exhibit, this, phenomenon, when, lasers, were, invented, in, 1960, they, were, called, a, solution, looking, for, a, problem, since, then, they, have, become, ubiquitous, finding, utility, in, thousands, of, highly, varied, applications, in, every, section, of, modern, society, including, consumer, electronics, information, technology, science, medicine, industry, law, enforcement, entertainment, and, the, military, fiber, optic, communication, using, lasers, is, a, key, technology, in, modern, communications, allowing, services, such, as, the, internet, the, first, widely, noticeable, use, of, lasers, was, the, supermarket, barcode, scanner, introduced, in, 1974, the, laserdisc, player, introduced, in, 1978, was, the, first, successful, consumer, product, to, include, a, laser, but, the, compact, disc, player, was, the, first, laser, equipped, device, to, become, common, beginning, in, 1982, followed, shortly, by, laser, printers, some, other, uses, are, in, 2004, excluding, diode, lasers, approximately, 131, 000, lasers, were, sold, with, a, value, of, us, 2, 19, billion, in, the, same, year, approximately, 733, million, diode, lasers, valued, at, us, 3, 20, billion, were, sold, lasers, have, many, uses, in, medicine, including, laser, surgery, particularly, eye, surgery, laser, healing, photobiomodulation, therapy, kidney, stone, treatment, ophthalmoscopy, and, cosmetic, skin, treatments, such, as, acne, treatment, cellulite, and, striae, reduction, and, hair, removal, lasers, are, used, to, treat, cancer, by, shrinking, or, destroying, tumors, or, precancerous, growths, they, are, most, commonly, used, to, treat, superficial, cancers, that, are, on, the, surface, of, the, body, or, the, lining, of, internal, organs, they, are, used, to, treat, basal, cell, skin, cancer, and, the, very, early, stages, of, others, like, cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, laser, therapy, is, often, combined, with, other, treatments, such, as, surgery, chemotherapy, or, radiation, therapy, laser, induced, interstitial, thermotherapy, litt, or, interstitial, laser, photocoagulation, uses, lasers, to, treat, some, cancers, using, hyperthermia, which, uses, heat, to, shrink, tumors, by, damaging, or, killing, cancer, cells, lasers, are, more, precise, than, traditional, surgery, methods, and, cause, less, damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and, scarring, a, disadvantage, is, that, surgeons, must, acquire, specialized, training, and, thus, it, will, likely, be, more, expensive, than, other, treatments, a, laser, weapon, is, a, laser, that, is, used, as, a, directed, energy, weapon, in, recent, years, some, hobbyists, have, taken, an, interest, in, lasers, lasers, used, by, hobbyists, are, generally, of, class, iiia, or, iiib, see, safety, although, some, have, made, their, own, class, iv, types, however, compared, to, other, hobbyists, laser, hobbyists, are, far, less, common, due, to, the, cost, and, potential, dangers, involved, due, to, the, cost, of, lasers, some, hobbyists, use, inexpensive, means, to, obtain, lasers, such, as, salvaging, laser, diodes, from, broken, dvd, players, red, blu, ray, players, violet, or, even, higher, power, laser, diodes, from, cd, or, dvd, burners, hobbyists, have, also, used, surplus, lasers, taken, from, retired, military, applications, and, modified, them, for, holography, pulsed, ruby, and, yag, lasers, work, well, for, this, application, different, applications, need, lasers, with, different, output, powers, lasers, that, produce, a, continuous, beam, or, a, series, of, short, pulses, can, be, compared, on, the, basis, of, their, average, power, lasers, that, produce, pulses, can, also, be, characterized, based, on, the, peak, power, of, each, pulse, the, peak, power, of, a, pulsed, laser, is, many, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, its, average, power, the, average, output, power, is, always, less, than, the, power, consumed, examples, of, pulsed, systems, with, high, peak, power, even, the, first, laser, was, recognized, as, being, potentially, dangerous, theodore, maiman, characterized, the, first, laser, as, having, the, power, of, one, gillette, as, it, could, burn, through, one, gillette, razor, blade, today, it, is, accepted, that, even, low, power, lasers, with, only, a, few, milliwatts, of, output, power, can, be, hazardous, to, human, eyesight, when, the, beam, hits, the, eye, directly, or, after, reflection, from, a, shiny, surface, at, wavelengths, which, the, cornea, and, the, lens, can, focus, well, the, coherence, and, low, divergence, of, laser, light, means, that, it, can, be, focused, by, the, eye, into, an, extremely, small, spot, on, the, retina, resulting, in, localized, burning, and, permanent, damage, in, seconds, or, even, less, time, lasers, are, usually, labeled, with, a, safety, class, number, which, identifies, how, dangerous, the, laser, is, the, indicated, powers, are, for, visible, light, continuous, wave, lasers, for, pulsed, lasers, and, invisible, wavelengths, other, power, limits, apply, people, working, with, class, 3b, and, class, 4, lasers, can, protect, their, eyes, with, safety, goggles, which, are, designed, to, absorb, light, of, a, particular, wavelength, infrared, lasers, with, wavelengths, longer, than, about, 1, 4, micrometers, are, often, referred, to, as, eye, safe, because, the, cornea, tends, to, absorb, light, at, these, wavelengths, protecting, the, retina, from, damage, the, label, eye, safe, can, be, misleading, however, as, it, applies, only, to, relatively, low, power, continuous, wave, beams, a, high, power, or, q, switched, laser, at, these, wavelengths, can, burn, the, cornea, causing, severe, eye, damage, and, even, moderate, power, lasers, can, injure, the, eye, lasers, can, be, a, hazard, to, both, civil, and, military, aviation, due, to, the, potential, to, temporarily, distract, or, blind, pilots, see, lasers, and, aviation, safety, for, more, on, this, topic, cameras, based, on, charge, coupled, devices, may, be, more, sensitive, to, laser, damage, than, biological, eyes
