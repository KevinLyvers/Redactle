of, engineering, or, enlarge, the, ipod, jobs, favored, the, former, approach, but, pitted, the, macintosh, and, ipod, teams, led, by, scott, forstall, and, tony, fadell, respectively, against, each, other, in, an, internal, competition, with, forstall, winning, by, creating, iphone, os, the, decision, enabled, the, success, of, the, iphone, as, a, platform, for, third, party, developers, using, a, well, known, desktop, operating, system, as, its, basis, allowed, the, many, third, party, mac, developers, to, write, software, for, the, iphone, with, minimal, retraining, forstall, was, also, responsible, for, creating, a, software, development, kit, for, programmers, to, build, iphone, apps, as, well, as, an, app, store, within, itunes, the, operating, system, was, unveiled, with, the,

updated, its, guidelines, to, specify, that, app, developers, will, no, longer, have, the, ability, to, use, custom, prompts, for, encouraging, users, to, leave, reviews, for, their, apps, ios, applications, can, also, be, installed, directly, from, an, ipa, file, provided, by, the, software, distributor, via, unofficial, ways, they, are, written, using, ios, software, development, kit, sdk, and, often, combined, with, xcode, using, officially, supported, programming, languages, including, swift, and, objective, c, other, companies, have, also, created, tools, that, allow, for, the, development, of, native, ios, apps, using, their, respective, programming, languages, applications, for, ios, are, mostly, built, using, components, of, uikit, a, programming, framework, it, allows, applications, to, have, a, consistent, look, and, feel, with, the, os, nevertheless, offering, customization, elements, automatically, update, along, with, ios, updates, automatically, including, new, interface, rules, uikit, elements, are, very, adaptable, this, allows, developers, to, design, a, single, app, that, looks, the, same, on, any, ios, device, in, addition, to, defining, the, ios, interface, uikit, defines, the, functionality, of, the, application, at, first, apple, did, not, intend, to, release, an, sdk, to, developers, because, they, did, not, want, third, party, apps, to, be, developed, for, ios, building, web, apps, instead, however, this, technology, never, entered, into, common, use, this, led, apple, to, change, its, opinion, so, in, october, 2007, the, sdk, for, developers, was, announced, finally, released, on, march, 6, 2008, the, sdk, includes, an, inclusive, set, of, development, tools, including, an, audio, mixer, and, an, iphone, simulator, it, is, a, free, download, for, mac, users, it, is, not, available, for, microsoft, windows, pcs, to, test, the, application, get, technical, support, and, distribute, applications, through, app, store, developers, are, required, to, subscribe, to, the, apple, developer, program, over, the, years, the, apple, store, apps, surpassed, multiple, major, milestones, including, 50, 000, 100, 000, 250, 000, 500, 000, 1, million, and, 2, million, apps, the, billionth, application, was, installed, on, april, 24, 2009, app, library, automatically, categorizes, apps, into, folders, based, on, their, function, or, type, and, incluses, an, alphabetical, list, of, all, installed, apps, for, example, it, might, group, all, social, media, apps, into, one, folder, and, productivity, apps, into, another, users, can, quickly, find, and, access, apps, by, using, the, search, bar, at, the, top, of, the, app, library, users, can, choose, to, hide, specific, app, pages, from, the, home, screen, making, it, easier, to, focus, on, the, apps, they, use, most, frequently, ios, enforces, strict, sandboxing, to, maintain, security, and, privacy, apps, are, generally, limited, to, accessing, their, own, containers, and, specific, system, provided, directories, such, as, the, photos, library, to, access, files, outside, of, their, sandbox, ios, uses, mechanisms, like, document, pickers, file, providers, and, app, extensions, ios, 8, introduced, the, document, picker, and, document, provider, extensions, as, part, of, the, document, interaction, controller, this, allows, apps, to, open, save, and, interact, with, documents, stored, in, a, central, location, or, cloud, storage, services, with, ios, 11, apple, introduced, the, files, app, and, the, file, provider, extension, providing, a, central, location, for, users, to, manage, and, organize, their, files, apps, can, integrate, with, the, files, app, to, make, their, documents, accessible, and, editable, directly, from, the, files, app, the, storage, of, ios, devices, can, be, expanded, through, icloud, the, apple, s, cloud, based, storage, solution, that, provides, 5gb, of, storage, for, free, to, all, users, while, other, plans, require, a, paid, subscription, icloud, drive, allows, users, to, store, various, types, of, files, such, as, documents, presentations, and, spreadsheets, in, the, cloud, these, files,

been, loosened, in, ios, 12, which, no, longer, requires, the, latter, multitasking, for, ios, was, first, released, in, june, 2010, along, with, the, release, of, ios, 4, only, certain, devices, iphone, 4, iphone, 3gs, and, ipod, touch, 3rd, generation, were, able, to, multitask, the, ipad, did, not, get, multitasking, until, ios, 4, 2, 1, in, that, november, the, implementation, of, multitasking, in, ios, has, been, criticized, for, its, approach, which, limits, the, work, that, applications, in, the, background, can, perform, to, a, limited, function, set, and, requires, application, developers, to, add, explicit, support, for, it, before, ios, 4, multitasking, was, limited, to, a, selection, of, the, applications, apple, included, on, the, device, users, could, however, jailbreak, their, device, in, order, to, unofficially, multitask, starting, with, ios, 4, on, third, generation, and, newer, ios, devices, multitasking, is, supported, through, seven, background, apis, in, ios, 5, three, new, background, apis, were, introduced, in, ios, 7, apple, introduced, a, new, multitasking, feature, providing, all, apps, with, the, ability, to, perform, background, updates, this, feature, prefers, to, update, the, user, s, most, frequently, used, apps, and, prefers, to, use, wi, fi, networks, over, a, cellular, network, without, markedly, reducing, the, device, s, battery, life, in, ios, 4, 0, to, ios, 6, x, double, clicking, the, home, button, activates, the, application, switcher, a, scrollable, dock, style, interface, appears, from, the, bottom, moving, the, contents, of, the, screen, up, choosing, an, icon, switches, to, an, application, to, the, far, left, are, icons, which, function, as, music, controls, a, rotation, lock, and, on, ios, 4, 2, and, above, a, volume, controller, with, the, introduction, of, ios, 7, double, clicking, the, home, button, also, activates, the, application, switcher, however, unlike, previous, versions, it, displays, screenshots, of, open, applications, on, top, of, the, icon, and, horizontal, scrolling, allows, for, browsing, through, previous, apps, and, it, is, possible, to, close, applications, by, dragging, them, up, similar, to, how, webos, handled, multiple, cards, with, the, introduction, of, ios, 9, the, application, switcher, received, a, significant, visual, change, while, still, retaining, the, card, metaphor, introduced, in, ios, 7, the, application, icon, is, smaller, and, appears, above, the, screenshot, which, is, now, larger, due, to, the, removal, of, recent, and, favorite, contacts, and, each, application, card, overlaps, the, other, forming, a, rolodex, effect, as, the, user, scrolls, now, instead, of, the, home, screen, appearing, at, the, leftmost, of, the, application, switcher, it, appears, rightmost, in, ios, 11, the, application, switcher, receives, a, major, redesign, in, the, ipad, the, control, center, and, app, switcher, are, combined, the, app, switcher, in, the, ipad, can, also, be, accessed, by, swiping, up, from, the, bottom, in, the, iphone, the, app, switcher, cannot, be, accessed, if, there, are, no, apps, in, the, ram, in, ios, 4, 0, to, ios, 6, x, briefly, holding, the, icons, in, the, application, switcher, makes, them, jiggle, similarly, to, the, homescreen, and, allows, the, user, to, force, quit, the, applications, by, tapping, the, red, minus, circle, that, appears, at, the, corner, of, the, app, s, icon, clearing, applications, from, multitasking, stayed, the, same, from, ios, 4, 0, through, 6, 1, 6, the, last, version, of, ios, 6, as, of, ios, 7, the, process, has, become, faster, and, easier, in, ios, 7, instead, of, holding, the, icons, to, close, them, they, are, closed, by, simply, swiping, them, upwards, off, the, screen, up, to, three, apps, can, be, cleared, at, a, time, compared, to, one, in, versions, up, to, ios, 6, 1, 6, task, completion, allows, apps, to, continue, a, certain, task, after, the, app, has, been, suspended, as, of, ios, 4, 0, apps, can, request, up, to, ten, minutes, to, complete, a, task, in, the, background, this, doesn, t, extend, to, background, uploads, and, downloads, though, e, g, if, a, user, starts, a, download, in, one, application, it, won, t, finish, if, they, switch, away, from, the, application, siri, s, r, i, is, a, virtual, assistant, integrated, into, ios, the, assistant, uses, voice, queries, and, a, natural, language, user, interface, to, answer, questions, make, recommendations, and, perform, actions, by, delegating, requests, to, a, set, of, internet, services, the, software, adapts, to, users, individual, language, usages, searches, and, preferences, with, continuing, use, returned, results, are, individualized, originally, released, as, an, app, for, ios, in, february, 2010, it, was, acquired, by, apple, two, months, later, and, then, integrated, into, iphone, 4s, at, its, release, in, october, 2011, at, that, time, the, separate, app, was, also, removed, from, the, ios, app, store, siri, supports, a, wide, range, of, user, commands, including, performing, phone, actions, checking, basic, information, scheduling, events, and, reminders, handling, device, settings, searching, the, internet, navigating, areas, finding, information, on, entertainment, and, is, able, to, engage, with, ios, integrated, apps, with, the, release, of, ios, 10, in, 2016, apple, opened, up, limited, third, party, access, to, siri, including, third, party, messaging, apps, as, well, as, payments, ride, sharing, and, internet, calling, apps, with, the, release, of, ios, 11, apple, updated, siri, s, voices, for, more, clear, human, voices, it, now, supports, follow, up, questions, and, language, translation, and, additional, third, party, actions, ios, 17, enabled, users, to, activate, siri, by, simply, saying, siri, while, the, previous, command, hey, siri, is, still, supported, game, center, is, an, online, multiplayer, social, gaming, network, released, by, apple, it, allows, users, to, invite, friends, to, play, a, game, start, a, multiplayer, game, through, matchmaking, track, their, achievements, and, compare, their, high, scores, on, a, leaderboard, ios, 5, and, above, adds, support, for, profile, photos, game, center, was, announced, during, an, ios, 4, preview, event, hosted, by, apple, on, april, 8, 2010, a, preview, was, released, to, registered, apple, developers, in, august, it, was, released, on, september, 8, 2010, with, ios, 4, 1, on, iphone, 4, iphone, 3gs, and, ipod, touch, 2nd, generation, through, 4th, generation, game, center, made, its, public, debut, on, the, ipad, with, ios, 4, 2, 1, there, is, no, support, for, the, iphone, 3g, original, iphone, and, the, first, generation, ipod, touch, the, latter, two, devices, did, not, have, game, center, because, they, did, not, get, ios, 4, however, game, center, is, unofficially, available, on, the, iphone, 3g, via, a, hack, the, main, hardware, platform, for, ios, is, the, arm, architecture, the, armv7, armv8, a, armv8, 2, a, armv8, 3, a, ios, releases, before, ios, 7, can, only, be, run, on, ios, devices, with, 32, bit, arm, processors, armv6, and, armv7, a, architectures, in, 2013, ios, 7, was, released, with, full, 64, bit, support, which, includes, a, native, 64, bit, kernel, libraries, drivers, as, well, as, all, built, in, applications, after, apple, announced, that, they, were, switching, to, 64, bit, armv8, a, processors, with, the, introduction, of, the, apple, a7, chip, 64, bit, support, was, also, enforced, for, all, apps, in, the, app, store, all, new, apps, submitted, to, the, app, store, with, a, deadline, of, february, 2015, and, all, app, updates, submitted, to, the, app, store, with, a, deadline, of, june, 1, 2015, ios, 11, drops, support, for, all, ios, devices, with, 32, bit, arm, processors, as, well, as, 32, bit, applications, making, ios, 64, bit, only, the, ios, sdk, software, development, kit, allows, for, the, development, of, mobile, apps, on, ios, while, originally, developing, iphone, prior, to, its, unveiling, in, 2007, apple, s, then, ceo, steve, jobs, did, not, intend, to, let, third, party, developers, build, native, apps, for, ios, instead, directing, them, to, make, web, applications, for, the, safari, web, browser, however, backlash, from, developers, prompted, the, company, to, reconsider, with, jobs, announcing, in, october, 2007, that, apple, would, have, a, software, development, kit, available, for, developers, by, february, 2008, the, sdk, was, released, on, march, 6, 2008, the, sdk, is, a, free, download, for, users, of, mac, personal, computers, it, is, not, available, for, microsoft, windows, pcs, the, sdk, contains, sets, giving, developers, access, to, various, functions, and, services, of, ios, devices, such, as, hardware, and, software, attributes, it, also, contains, an, iphone, simulator, to, mimic, the, look, and, feel, of, the, device, on, the, computer, while, developing, new, versions, of, the, sdk, accompany, new, versions, of, ios, in, order, to, test, applications, get, technical, support, and, distribute, apps, through, app, store, developers, are, required, to, subscribe, to, the, apple, developer, program, combined, with, xcode, the, ios, sdk, helps, developers, write, ios, apps, using, officially, supported, programming, languages, including, swift, and, objective, c, other, companies, have, also, created, tools, that, allow, for, the, development, of, native, ios, apps, using, their, respective, programming, languages, iphone, platform, usage, as, measured, by, the, app, store, on, june, 9th, 2024, ipad, platform, usage, as, measured, by, the, app, store, on, june, 9th, 2024, apple, provides, major, updates, to, the, ios, operating, system, annually, via, itunes, and, since, ios, 5, also, over, the, air, the, device, checks, an, xml, based, plist, file, on, mesu, apple, com, for, updates, updates, are, delivered, as, unencrypted, zip, files, updates, are, checked, for, regularly, and, are, downloaded, and, installed, automatically, if, enabled, otherwise, the, user, can, install, them, manually, or, are, prompted, to, allow, automatic, installation, overnight, if, plugged, in, and, connected, to, wi, fi, ipod, touch, users, originally, had, to, pay, for, system, software, updates, due, to, accounting, rules, that, designated, it, not, a, subscription, device, like, the, iphone, or, apple, tv, causing, many, ipod, touch, owners, not, to, update, in, september, 2009, a, change, in, accounting, rules, won, tentative, approval, affecting, apple, s, earnings, and, stock, price, and, allowing, ipod, touch, updates, to, be, delivered, free, of, charge, apple, significantly, extended, the, cycle, of, updates, for, ios, supported, devices, over, the, years, the, iphone, 1st, generation, and, iphone, 3g, only, received, two, ios, updates, while, later, models, had, support, for, five, six, and, seven, years, the, ios, kernel, is, the, xnu, kernel, of, darwin, the, original, iphone, os, 1, 0, up, to, iphone, os, 3, 1, 3, used, darwin, 9, 0, 0d1, ios, 4, was, based, on, darwin, 10, ios, 5, was, based, on, darwin, 11, ios, 6, was, based, on, darwin, 13, ios, 7, and, ios, 8, are, based, on, darwin, 14, ios, 9, is, based, on, darwin, 15, ios, 10, is, based, on, darwin, 16, ios, 11, is, based, on, darwin, 17, ios, 12, is, based, on, darwin, 18, ios, 13, is, based, on, darwin, 19, ios, 14, is, based, on, darwin, 20, ios, 15, is, based, on, darwin, 21, ios, 16, is, based, on, darwin, 22, in, ios, 6, the, kernel, is, subject, to, aslr, similar, to, that, of, os, x, mountain, lion, this, makes, exploit, possibilities, more, complex, since, it, is, not, possible, to, know, the, location, of, kernel, code, apple, has, made, the, xnu, kernel, open, source, the, source, is, under, a, 3, clause, bsd, license, for, the, original, bsd, parts, with, parts, added, by, apple, under, the, apple, public, source, license, the, versions, contained, in, ios, are, not, available, only, the, versions, used, in, macos, are, available, ios, does, not, have, kernel, extensions, kexts, in, the, file, system, even, if, they, are, actually, present, the, kernel, cache, can, be, decompressed, to, show, the, correct, kernel, along, with, the, kexts, all, packed, in, the, prelink, text, section, and, their, plists, in, the, prelink, info, section, the, kernel, cache, can, also, be, directly, decompressed, if, decrypted, using, third, party, tools, with, the, advent, of, ios, 10, betas, and, default, plain, text, kernelcaches, these, tools, can, only, be, used, after, unpacking, and, applying, lzssdec, to, unpack, the, kernel, cache, to, its, full, size, the, kextstat, provided, by, the, cydia, alternative, software, does, not, work, on, ios, because, the, kextstat, is, based, on, kmod, get, info, which, is, a, deprecated, api, in, ios, 4, and, mac, os, x, snow, leopard, there, are, other, alternative, software, that, can, also, dump, raw, xml, data, on, developing, devices, the, kernel, is, always, stored, as, a, statically, linked, cache, stored, in, system, library, caches, com, apple, kernelcaches, kernelcache, which, is, unpacked, and, executed, at, boot, in, the, beginning, ios, had, a, kernel, version, usually, higher, than, the, corresponding, version, of, macos, over, time, the, kernels, of, ios, and, macos, have, gotten, closer, this, is, not, surprising, considering, that, ios, introduced, new, features, such, as, the, aslr, kernel, the, default, freezer, and, various, security, strengthening, features, that, were, first, incorporated, and, subsequently, arrived, on, macos, it, appears, apple, is, gradually, merging, the, ios, and, macos, kernels, over, time, the, build, date, for, each, version, varies, slightly, between, processors, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, builds, are, sequential, the, kernel, image, base, is, randomized, by, the, boot, loader, iboot, this, is, done, by, creating, random, data, doing, a, sha, 1, hash, of, it, and, then, using, a, byte, from, the, sha, 1, hash, for, the, kernel, slide, the, slide, is, calculated, with, this, formula, if, the, slide, is, 0, the, static, offset, of, 0x21000000, is, used, instead, the, adjusted, base, is, passed, to, the, kernel, in, the, boot, arguments, structure, at, offset, 0x04, which, is, equivalent, to, gbootargs, virtbase, the, kernel, map, is, used, for, kernel, allocations, of, all, types, kalloc, kernel, memory, allocate, etc, and, spans, all, of, kernel, space, 0x80000000, 0xfffeffff, the, kernel, based, maps, are, submaps, of, the, kernel, map, for, example, zone, map, ipc, kernel, map, etc, the, strategy, is, to, randomize, the, base, of, the, kernel, map, a, random, 9, bit, value, is, generated, right, after, kmem, init, which, establishes, kernel, map, is, multiplied, by, the, page, size, the, resulting, value, is, used, as, the, size, for, the, initial, kernel, map, allocation, future, kernel, map, and, submap, allocations, are, pushed, forward, by, a, random, amount, the, allocation, is, silently, removed, after, the, first, garbage, collection, and, reused, this, behaviour, can, be, overridden, with, the, kmapoff, boot, parameter, internally, ios, identifies, each, version, by, a, codename, often, used, internally, only, normally, to, maintain, secrecy, of, the, project, for, example, the, codename, for, ios, 17, is, dawn, since, its, initial, release, ios, has, been, subject, to, a, variety, of, different, hacks, centered, around, adding, functionality, not, allowed, by, apple, prior, to, the, 2008, debut, of, apple, s, native, ios, app, store, the, primary, motive, for, jailbreaking, was, to, bypass, apple, s, purchase, mechanism, for, installing, the, app, store, s, native, applications, apple, claimed, that, it, would, not, release, ios, software, updates, designed, specifically, to, break, these, tools, other, than, applications, that, perform, sim, unlocking, however, with, each, subsequent, ios, update, previously, un, patched, jailbreak, exploits, are, usually, patched, when, a, device, is, booting, it, loads, apple, s, own, kernel, initially, so, a, jailbroken, device, must, be, exploited, and, have, the, kernel, patched, each, time, it, is, booted, up, there, are, different, types, of, jailbreak, an, untethered, jailbreak, uses, exploits, that, are, powerful, enough, to, allow, the, user, to, turn, their, device, off, and, back, on, at, will, with, the, device, starting, up, completely, and, the, kernel, will, be, patched, without, the, help, of, a, computer, in, other, words, it, will, be, jailbroken, even, after, each, reboot, however, some, jailbreaks, are, tethered, a, tethered, jailbreak, is, only, able, to, temporarily, jailbreak, the, device, during, a, single, boot, if, the, user, turns, the, device, off, and, then, boots, it, back, up, without, the, help, of, a, jailbreak, tool, the, device, will, no, longer, be, running, a, patched, kernel, and, it, may, get, stuck, in, a, partially, started, state, such, as, recovery, mode, in, order, for, the, device, to, start, completely, and, with, a, patched, kernel, it, must, be, re, jailbroken, with, a, computer, using, the, boot, tethered, feature, of, a, tool, each, time, it, is, turned, on, all, changes, to, the, files, on, the, device, such, as, installed, package, files, or, edited, system, files, will, persist, between, reboots, including, changes, that, can, only, function, if, the, device, is, jailbroken, such, as, installed, package, files, in, more, recent, years, two, other, solutions, have, been, created, semi, tethered, and, semi, untethered, a, semi, tethered, solution, is, one, where, the, device, is, able, to, start, up, on, its, own, but, it, will, no, longer, have, a, patched, kernel, and, therefore, will, not, be, able, to, run, modified, code, it, will, however, still, be, usable, for, normal, functions, just, like, stock, ios, to, start, with, a, patched, kernel, the, user, must, start, the, device, with, the, help, of, the, jailbreak, tool, a, semi, untethered, jailbreak, gives, the, ability, to, start, the, device, on, its, own, on, first, boot, the, device, will, not, be, running, a, patched, kernel, however, rather, than, having, to, run, a, tool, from, a, computer, to, apply, the, kernel, patches, the, user, is, able, to, re, jailbreak, their, device, with, the, help, of, an, app, usually, sideloaded, using, cydia, impactor, running, on, their, device, in, the, case, of, the, ios, 9, 2, 9, 3, 3, and, 64, bit, 10, x, jailbreaks, safari, based, exploits, were, available, thereby, meaning, websites, could, be, used, to, re, jailbreak, in, more, detail, each, ios, device, has, a, bootchain, that, tries, to, make, sure, only, trusted, signed, code, is, loaded, a, device, with, a, tethered, jailbreak, is, able, to, boot, up, with, the, help, of, a, jailbreaking, tool, because, the, tool, executes, exploits, via, usb, that, bypass, parts, of, that, chain, of, trust, bootstrapping, to, a, pwned, no, signature, check, ibec, or, iboot, to, finish, the, boot, process, since, the, arrival, of, apple, s, native, ios, app, store, and, along, with, it, third, party, applications, the, general, motives, for, jailbreaking, have, changed, people, jailbreak, for, many, different, reasons, including, gaining, filesystem, access, installing, custom, device, themes, and, modifying, springboard, an, additional, motivation, is, that, it, may, enable, the, installation, of, pirated, apps, on, some, devices, jailbreaking, also, makes, it, possible, to, install, alternative, operating, systems, such, as, android, and, the, linux, kernel, primarily, users, jailbreak, their, devices, because, of, the, limitations, of, ios, depending, on, the, method, used, the, effects, of, jailbreaking, may, be, permanent, or, temporary, in, 2010, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, eff, successfully, convinced, the, u, s, copyright, office, to, allow, an, exemption, to, the, general, prohibition, on, circumvention, of, copyright, protection, systems, under, the, digital, millennium, copyright, act, dmca, the, exemption, allows, jailbreaking, of, iphones, for, the, sole, purpose, of, allowing, legally, obtained, applications, to, be, added, to, the, iphone, the, exemption, does, not, affect, the, contractual, relations, between, apple, and, an, iphone, owner, for, example, jailbreaking, voiding, the, iphone, warranty, however, it, is, solely, based, on, apple, s, discretion, on, whether, they, will, fix, jailbroken, devices, in, the, event, that, they, need, to, be, repaired, at, the, same, time, the, copyright, office, exempted, unlocking, an, iphone, from, dmca, s, anticircumvention, prohibitions, unlocking, an, iphone, allows, the, iphone, to, be, used, with, any, wireless, carrier, using, the, same, gsm, or, cdma, technology, for, which, the, particular, phone, model, was, designed, to, operate, initially, most, wireless, carriers, in, the, us, did, not, allow, iphone, owners, to, unlock, it, for, use, with, other, carriers, however, at, t, allowed, iphone, owners, who, had, satisfied, contract, requirements, to, unlock, their, iphone, instructions, to, unlock, the, device, are, available, from, apple, but, it, is, ultimately, at, the, sole, discretion, of, the, carrier, to, authorize, unlocking, the, device, this, allows, the, use, of, a, carrier, sourced, iphone, on, other, networks, modern, versions, of, ios, and, the, iphone, fully, support, lte, across, multiple, carriers, wherever, the, phone, was, purchased, programs, to, remove, sim, lock, restrictions, are, available, but, are, not, supported, by, apple, and, most, often, not, a, permanent, unlock, a, soft, unlock, which, modifies, the, iphone, so, that, the, baseband, will, accept, the, sim, card, of, any, gsm, carrier, sim, unlocking, is, not, jailbreaking, but, a, jailbreak, is, also, required, for, these, unofficial, software, unlocks, the, legality, of, software, unlocking, varies, in, each, country, for, example, in, the, us, there, is, a, dmca, exemption, for, unofficial, software, unlocking, of, devices, purchased, before, january, 26, 2013, the, closed, and, proprietary, nature, of, ios, has, garnered, criticism, particularly, by, digital, rights, advocates, such, as, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, computer, engineer, and, activist, brewster, kahle, internet, law, specialist, jonathan, zittrain, and, the, free, software, foundation, who, protested, the, ipad, s, introductory, event, and, have, targeted, the, ipad, with, their, defective, by, design, campaign, competitor, microsoft, via, a, pr, spokesman, criticized, apple, s, control, over, its, platform, at, issue, are, restrictions, imposed, by, the, design, of, ios, namely, digital, rights, management, drm, intended, to, lock, purchased, media, to, apple, s, platform, the, development, model, requiring, a, yearly, subscription, to, distribute, apps, developed, for, the, ios, the, centralized, approval, process, for, apps, as, well, as, apple, s, general, control, and, lockdown, of, the, platform, itself, particularly, at, issue, is, the, ability, for, apple, to, remotely, disable, or, delete, apps, at, will, some, in, the, tech, community, have, expressed, concern, that, the, locked, down, ios, represents, a, growing, trend, in, apple, s, approach, to, computing, particularly, apple, s, shift, away, from, machines, that, hobbyists, can, tinker, with, and, note, the, potential, for, such, restrictions, to, stifle, software, innovation, former, facebook, developer, joe, hewitt, protested, against, apple, s, control, over, its, hardware, as, a, horrible, precedent, but, praised, ios, s, sandboxing, of, apps, ios, utilizes, many, security, features, in, both, hardware, and, software, ios, is, the, second, most, popular, mobile, operating, system, in, the, world, after, android, sales, of, ipads, in, recent, years, are, also, behind, android, while, by, web, use, a, proxy, for, all, use, ipads, using, ios, are, still, the, most, popular, at, wwdc, 2014, tim, cook, said, 800, million, devices, had, been, sold, by, june, 2014, during, apple, s, quarterly, earnings, call, in, january, 2015, the, company, announced, that, they, had, sold, over, one, billion, ios, devices, since, 2007, by, february, 2023, there, were, 2, billion, devices, activated, and, 1, 5, billion, iphones, had, been, sold, since, 2007, by, late, 2011, ios, accounted, for, 60, of, the, market, share, for, smartphones, and, tablets, by, the, end,
