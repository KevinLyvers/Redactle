shipbuilding, is, the, construction, of, ships, and, other, floating, vessels, in, modern, times, it, normally, takes, place, in, a, specialized, facility, known, as, a, shipyard, shipbuilders, also, called, shipwrights, follow, a, specialized, occupation, that, traces, its, roots, to, before, recorded, history, until, recently, with, the, development, of, complex, non, maritime, technologies, a, ship, has, often, represented, the, most, advanced, structure, that, the, society, building, it, could, produce, ch1, some, key, industrial, advances, were, developed, to, support, shipbuilding, for, instance, the, sawing, of, timbers, by, mechanical, saws, propelled, by, windmills, in, dutch, shipyards, during, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, 34, 37, the, design, process, saw, the, early, adoption, of, the, logarithm, invented, in, 1615, to, generate, the, curves, used, to, produce, the, shape, of, a, hull, especially, when, scaling, up, these, curves, accurately, in, the, mould, loft, shipbuilding, and, ship, repairs, both, commercial, and, military, are, referred, to, as, naval, engineering, the, construction, of, boats, is, a, similar, activity, called, boat, building, the, dismantling, of, ships, is, called, ship, breaking, the, earliest, evidence, of, maritime, transport, by, modern, humans, is, the, settlement, of, australia, between, 50, 000, and, 60, 000, years, ago, this, almost, certainly, involved, rafts, possibly, equipped, with, some, sort, of, sail, 29, 33, much, of, the, development, beyond, that, raft, technology, occurred, in, the, nursery, areas, of, the, mediterranean, and, in, maritime, southeast, asia, favoured, by, warmer, waters, and, a, number, of, inter, visible, islands, boats, and, later, ships, with, water, tight, hulls, unlike, the, flow, through, structure, of, a, raft, could, be, developed, 113, 7, 63, the, ships, of, ancient, egypt, were, built, by, joining, the, hull, planks, together, edge, to, edge, with, tenons, set, in, mortices, cut, in, the, mating, edges, a, similar, technique, but, with, the, tenons, being, pinned, in, position, by, dowels, was, used, in, the, mediterranean, for, most, of, classical, antiquity, both, these, variants, are, shell, first, techniques, where, any, reinforcing, frames, are, inserted, after, assembly, of, the, planking, has, defined, the, hull, shape, 81, 88, carvel, construction, then, took, over, in, the, mediterranean, northern, europe, used, clinker, construction, but, with, some, flush, planked, ship, building, in, for, instance, the, bottom, planking, of, cogs, ch4, the, north, european, and, mediterranean, traditions, merged, in, the, late, 15th, century, with, carvel, construction, being, adopted, in, the, north, and, the, centre, line, mounted, rudder, replacing, the, quarter, rudder, of, the, mediterranean, these, changes, broadly, coincided, with, improvements, in, sailing, rigs, with, the, three, masted, ship, becoming, common, with, square, sails, on, the, fore, and, main, masts, and, a, fore, and, aft, sail, on, the, mizzen, ship, building, then, saw, a, steady, improvement, in, design, techniques, and, introduction, of, new, materials, iron, was, used, for, more, than, fastenings, nails, and, bolts, as, structural, components, such, as, iron, knees, were, introduced, with, examples, existing, in, the, mid, 18th, century, and, from, the, mid, 19th, century, onwards, this, was, partly, led, by, the, shortage, of, compass, timber, the, naturally, curved, timber, that, meant, that, shapes, could, be, cut, without, weaknesses, caused, by, cuts, across, the, grain, of, the, timber, ch8, ultimately, whole, ships, were, made, of, iron, and, later, steel, the, earliest, known, depictions, including, paintings, and, models, of, shallow, water, sailing, boats, is, from, the, 6th, to, 5th, millennium, bc, of, the, ubaid, period, of, mesopotamia, they, were, made, from, bundled, reeds, coated, in, bitumen, and, had, bipod, masts, they, sailed, in, shallow, coastal, waters, of, the, persian, gulf, evidence, from, ancient, egypt, shows, that, the, early, egyptians, knew, how, to, assemble, planks, of, wood, into, a, ship, hull, as, early, as, 3100, bc, egyptian, pottery, as, old, as, 4000, bc, shows, designs, of, early, fluvial, boats, or, other, means, for, navigation, the, archaeological, institute, of, america, reports, that, some, of, the, oldest, ships, yet, unearthed, are, known, as, the, abydos, boats, these, are, a, group, of, 14, ships, discovered, in, abydos, that, were, constructed, of, wooden, planks, which, were, sewn, together, discovered, by, egyptologist, david, o, connor, of, new, york, university, woven, straps, were, found, to, have, been, used, to, lash, the, planks, together, and, reeds, or, grass, stuffed, between, the, planks, helped, to, seal, the, seams, because, the, ships, are, all, buried, together, and, near, a, mortuary, belonging, to, pharaoh, khasekhemwy, originally, they, were, all, thought, to, have, belonged, to, him, but, one, of, the, 14, ships, dates, to, 3000, bc, and, the, associated, pottery, jars, buried, with, the, vessels, also, suggest, earlier, dating, the, ship, dating, to, 3000, bc, was, about, 75, feet, 23, m, long, and, is, now, thought, to, perhaps, have, belonged, to, an, earlier, pharaoh, according, to, professor, o, connor, the, 5, 000, year, old, ship, may, have, even, belonged, to, pharaoh, aha, the, austronesian, expansion, which, began, c, 3000, bc, with, migration, from, taiwan, to, the, island, of, luzon, in, the, philippines, spread, across, island, southeast, asia, then, between, 1500, bc, and, 1500, ad, they, settled, uninhabited, islands, of, the, pacific, and, also, sailed, westward, to, madagascar, this, is, associated, with, distinctive, maritime, technology, lashed, lug, construction, techniques, both, in, outrigger, canoes, and, in, large, planked, sailing, vessels, various, types, of, outrigger, and, twin, hulled, canoes, and, a, range, of, sailing, rigs, that, included, the, crab, claw, sail, the, origins, of, this, technology, is, difficult, to, date, relying, largely, on, linguistics, studying, the, words, for, parts, of, boats, the, written, comments, of, people, from, other, cultures, including, the, observations, of, european, explorers, at, the, time, of, first, contact, and, the, later, more, systematic, ethnographic, observations, of, the, types, of, craft, in, use, there, is, only, a, small, body, of, archaeological, evidence, available, since, island, southeast, asia, contained, effective, maritime, transport, between, its, very, large, number, of, islands, long, before, austronesian, seafaring, it, is, argued, that, austronesians, adopted, an, existing, maritime, technology, from, the, existing, inhabitants, of, this, region, 50, 64, 85, 88, 487, 488, austronesian, ships, varied, from, simple, canoes, to, large, multihull, ships, the, simplest, form, of, all, ancestral, austronesian, boats, had, five, parts, the, bottom, part, consists, of, a, single, piece, of, hollowed, out, log, at, the, sides, were, two, planks, and, two, horseshoe, shaped, wood, pieces, formed, the, prow, and, stern, these, were, fitted, tightly, together, edge, to, edge, with, dowels, inserted, into, holes, in, between, and, then, lashed, to, each, other, with, ropes, made, from, rattan, or, fiber, wrapped, around, protruding, lugs, on, the, planks, this, characteristic, and, ancient, austronesian, boatbuilding, practice, is, known, as, the, lashed, lug, technique, they, were, commonly, caulked, with, pastes, made, from, various, plants, as, well, as, tapa, bark, and, fibres, which, would, expand, when, wet, further, tightening, joints, and, making, the, hull, watertight, they, formed, the, shell, of, the, boat, which, was, then, reinforced, by, horizontal, ribs, shipwrecks, of, austronesian, ships, can, be, identified, from, this, construction, as, well, as, the, absence, of, metal, nails, austronesian, ships, traditionally, had, no, central, rudders, but, were, instead, steered, using, an, oar, on, one, side, austronesians, traditionally, made, their, sails, from, woven, mats, of, the, resilient, and, salt, resistant, pandanus, leaves, these, sails, allowed, austronesians, to, embark, on, long, distance, voyaging, the, ancient, champa, of, vietnam, also, uniquely, developed, basket, hulled, boats, whose, hulls, were, composed, of, woven, and, resin, caulked, bamboo, either, entirely, or, in, conjunction, with, plank, strakes, they, range, from, small, coracles, the, o, th, ng, to, large, ocean, going, trading, ships, like, the, ghe, m, nh, early, egyptians, also, knew, how, to, assemble, planks, of, wood, with, treenails, to, fasten, them, together, using, pitch, for, caulking, the, seams, the, khufu, ship, a, 43, 6, meter, vessel, sealed, into, a, pit, in, the, giza, pyramid, complex, at, the, foot, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, in, the, fourth, dynasty, around, 2500, bc, is, a, full, size, surviving, example, which, may, have, fulfilled, the, symbolic, function, of, a, solar, barque, early, egyptians, also, knew, how, to, fasten, the, planks, of, this, ship, together, with, mortise, and, tenon, joints, the, oldest, known, tidal, dock, in, the, world, was, built, around, 2500, bc, during, the, harappan, civilisation, at, lothal, near, the, present, day, mangrol, harbour, on, the, gujarat, coast, in, india, other, ports, were, probably, at, balakot, and, dwarka, however, it, is, probable, that, many, small, scale, ports, and, not, massive, ports, were, used, for, the, harappan, maritime, trade, ships, from, the, harbour, at, these, ancient, port, cities, established, trade, with, mesopotamia, shipbuilding, and, boatmaking, may, have, been, prosperous, industries, in, ancient, india, native, labourers, may, have, manufactured, the, flotilla, of, boats, used, by, alexander, the, great, to, navigate, across, the, hydaspes, and, even, the, indus, under, nearchos, the, indians, also, exported, teak, for, shipbuilding, to, ancient, persia, other, references, to, indian, timber, used, for, shipbuilding, is, noted, in, the, works, of, ibn, jubayr, the, ships, of, ancient, egypt, s, eighteenth, dynasty, were, typically, about, 25, meters, 80, ft, in, length, and, had, a, single, mast, sometimes, consisting, of, two, poles, lashed, together, at, the, top, making, an, a, shape, they, mounted, a, single, square, sail, on, a, yard, with, an, additional, spar, along, the, bottom, of, the, sail, these, ships, could, also, be, oar, propelled, the, ocean, and, sea, going, ships, of, ancient, egypt, were, constructed, with, cedar, wood, most, likely, hailing, from, lebanon, the, ships, of, phoenicia, seem, to, have, been, of, a, similar, design, austronesians, established, the, austronesian, maritime, trade, network, at, around, 1000, to, 600, bc, linking, southeast, asia, with, east, asia, south, asia, the, middle, east, and, later, east, africa, the, route, later, became, part, of, the, spice, trade, network, and, the, maritime, silk, road, the, naval, history, of, china, stems, back, to, the, spring, and, autumn, period, 722, bc, 481, bc, of, the, ancient, chinese, zhou, dynasty, the, chinese, built, large, rectangular, barges, known, as, castle, ships, which, were, essentially, floating, fortresses, complete, with, multiple, decks, with, guarded, ramparts, however, the, chinese, vessels, during, this, era, were, essentially, fluvial, riverine, true, ocean, going, chinese, fleets, did, not, appear, until, the, 10th, century, song, dynasty, 20, 21, there, is, considerable, knowledge, regarding, shipbuilding, and, seafaring, in, the, ancient, mediterranean, large, multi, masted, seafaring, ships, of, southeast, asian, austronesians, first, started, appearing, in, chinese, records, during, the, han, dynasty, as, the, k, un, lun, po, or, kunlun, bo, ship, of, the, k, un, lun, these, ships, used, two, types, of, sail, of, their, invention, the, junk, sail, and, tanja, sail, large, ships, are, about, 50, 60, metres, 164, 197, ft, long, had, 5, 2, 7, 8, metres, 17, 26, ft, tall, freeboard, each, carrying, provisions, enough, for, a, year, 464, and, could, carry, 200, 1000, people, the, chinese, recorded, that, these, southeast, asian, ships, were, hired, for, passage, to, south, asia, by, chinese, buddhist, pilgrims, and, travelers, because, they, did, not, build, seaworthy, ships, of, their, own, until, around, the, 8, 9th, century, ad, 276, austronesians, especially, from, western, island, southeast, asia, were, trading, in, the, indian, ocean, as, far, as, africa, during, this, period, by, around, 50, to, 500, ad, a, group, of, austronesians, believed, to, be, from, the, southeastern, coasts, of, borneo, possibly, a, mixed, group, related, to, the, modern, ma, anyan, banjar, and, or, the, dayak, people, crossed, the, indian, ocean, and, colonized, madagascar, this, resulted, in, the, introduction, of, outrigger, canoe, technology, to, non, austronesian, cultures, in, the, east, african, coast, the, ancient, chinese, also, built, fluvial, ramming, vessels, as, in, the, greco, roman, tradition, of, the, trireme, although, oar, steered, ships, in, china, lost, favor, very, early, on, since, it, was, in, the, 1st, century, china, that, the, stern, mounted, rudder, was, first, developed, this, was, dually, met, with, the, introduction, of, the, han, dynasty, junk, ship, design, in, the, same, century, the, chinese, were, using, square, sails, during, the, han, dynasty, and, adopted, the, austronesian, junk, sail, later, in, the, 12th, century, 20, 21, iconographic, remains, show, that, chinese, ships, before, the, 12th, century, used, square, sails, and, the, junk, rig, of, chinese, ships, is, believed, to, be, developed, from, tilted, sails, 612, 613, southern, chinese, junks, were, based, on, keeled, and, multi, planked, austronesian, ship, known, as, po, by, the, chinese, from, the, old, javanese, parahu, 1280, javanese, prau, or, malay, perahu, large, ship, 613, 193, 21, southern, chinese, junks, showed, characteristics, of, austronesian, ships, that, they, are, made, using, timbers, of, tropical, origin, with, keeled, v, shaped, hull, this, is, different, from, northern, chinese, junks, which, are, developed, from, flat, bottomed, riverine, boats, 20, 21, the, northern, chinese, junks, were, primarily, built, of, pine, or, fir, wood, had, flat, bottoms, with, no, keel, water, tight, bulkheads, with, no, frames, transom, squared, stern, and, stem, and, have, their, planks, fastened, with, iron, nails, or, clamps, 612, 614, it, was, unknown, when, the, chinese, people, started, adopting, southeast, asian, austronesian, shipbuilding, techniques, they, may, have, been, started, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, but, the, development, was, gradual, and, the, true, ocean, going, chinese, junks, did, not, appear, suddenly, 276, 200, 83, the, word, po, survived, in, chinese, long, after, referring, to, the, large, ocean, going, junks, 274, in, september, 2011, archeological, investigations, done, at, the, site, of, portus, in, rome, revealed, inscriptions, in, a, shipyard, constructed, during, the, reign, of, trajan, 98, 117, that, indicated, the, existence, of, a, shipbuilders, guild, roughly, at, this, time, is, the, last, migration, wave, of, the, austronesian, expansion, when, the, polynesian, islands, spread, over, vast, distances, across, the, pacific, ocean, were, being, colonized, by, the, austronesian, polynesians, from, island, melanesia, using, double, hulled, voyaging, catamarans, at, its, furthest, extent, there, is, a, possibility, that, they, may, have, reached, the, americas, after, the, 11th, century, a, new, type, of, ship, called, djong, or, jong, was, recorded, in, java, and, bali, 222, 230, 267, 82, this, type, of, ship, was, built, using, wooden, dowels, and, treenails, unlike, the, kunlun, bo, which, used, vegetal, fibres, for, lashings, 138, the, empire, of, majapahit, used, jong, built, in, northern, java, for, transporting, troops, overseas, 115, the, jongs, were, transport, ships, which, could, carry, 100, 2000, tons, of, cargo, and, 50, 1000, people, 28, 99, 88, 56, meter, in, length, 60, 62, the, exact, number, of, jong, fielded, by, majapahit, is, unknown, but, the, largest, number, of, jong, deployed, in, an, expedition, is, about, 400, jongs, when, majapahit, attacked, pasai, in, 1350, until, recently, viking, longships, were, seen, as, marking, an, advance, on, traditional, clinker, built, hulls, where, leather, thongs, were, used, to, join, plank, boards, this, consensus, has, recently, been, challenged, haywood, has, argued, that, earlier, frankish, and, anglo, saxon, nautical, practice, was, much, more, accomplished, than, had, been, thought, and, has, described, the, distribution, of, clinker, vs, carvel, construction, in, western, europe, see, map, an, insight, into, shipbuilding, in, the, north, sea, baltic, areas, of, the, early, medieval, period, was, found, at, sutton, hoo, england, where, a, ship, was, buried, with, a, chieftain, the, ship, was, 26, metres, 85, ft, long, and, 4, 3, metres, 14, ft, wide, upward, from, the, keel, the, hull, was, made, by, overlapping, nine, strakes, on, either, side, with, rivets, fastening, the, oaken, planks, together, it, could, hold, upwards, of, thirty, men, sometime, around, the, 12th, century, northern, european, ships, began, to, be, built, with, a, straight, sternpost, enabling, the, mounting, of, a, rudder, which, was, much, more, durable, than, a, steering, oar, held, over, the, side, development, in, the, middle, ages, favored, round, ships, with, a, broad, beam, and, heavily, curved, at, both, ends, another, important, ship, type, was, the, galley, which, was, constructed, with, both, sails, and, oars, the, first, extant, treatise, on, shipbuilding, was, written, c, 1436, by, michael, of, rhodes, a, man, who, began, his, career, as, an, oarsman, on, a, venetian, galley, in, 1401, and, worked, his, way, up, into, officer, positions, he, wrote, and, illustrated, a, book, that, contains, a, treatise, on, shipbuilding, a, treatise, on, mathematics, much, material, on, astrology, and, other, materials, his, treatise, on, shipbuilding, treats, three, kinds, of, galleys, and, two, kinds, of, round, ships, shipbuilders, in, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, were, not, the, same, as, the, shipbuilders, in, other, chinese, dynasties, due, to, hundreds, of, years, of, accumulated, experiences, and, rapid, changes, in, the, ming, dynasty, shipbuilders, in, the, ming, dynasty, primarily, worked, for, the, government, under, command, of, the, ministry, of, public, works, during, the, early, years, of, the, ming, dynasty, the, ming, government, maintained, an, open, policy, towards, sailing, between, 1405, and, 1433, the, government, conducted, seven, diplomatic, ming, treasure, voyages, to, over, thirty, countries, in, southeast, asia, india, the, middle, east, and, eastern, africa, the, voyages, were, initiated, by, the, yongle, emperor, and, led, by, the, admiral, zheng, he, six, voyages, were, conducted, under, the, yongle, emperor, s, reign, the, last, of, which, returned, to, china, in, 1422, after, the, yongle, emperor, s, death, in, 1424, his, successor, the, hongxi, emperor, ordered, the, suspension, of, the, voyages, the, seventh, and, final, voyage, began, in, 1430, sent, by, the, xuande, emperor, although, the, hongxi, and, xuande, emperors, did, not, emphasize, sailing, as, much, as, the, yongle, emperor, they, were, not, against, it, this, led, to, a, high, degree, of, commercialization, and, an, increase, in, trade, large, numbers, of, ships, were, built, to, meet, the, demand, the, ming, voyages, were, large, in, size, numbering, as, many, as, 300, ships, and, 28, 000, men, the, shipbuilders, were, brought, from, different, places, in, china, to, the, shipyard, in, nanjing, including, zhejiang, jiangxi, fujian, and, huguang, now, the, provinces, of, hubei, and, hunan, one, of, the, most, famous, shipyards, was, long, jiang, shipyard, zh, located, in, nanjing, near, the, treasure, shipyard, where, the, ocean, going, ships, were, built, the, shipbuilders, could, build, 24, models, of, ships, of, varying, sizes, several, types, of, ships, were, built, for, the, voyages, including, shachuan, fuchuan, and, baochuan, treasure, ship, zheng, he, s, treasure, ships, were, regarded, as, shachuan, types, mainly, because, they, were, made, in, the, treasure, shipyard, in, nanjing, shachuan, or, sand, ships, are, ships, used, primarily, for, inland, transport, however, in, recent, years, some, researchers, agree, that, the, treasure, ships, were, more, of, the, fuchuan, type, it, is, said, in, vol, 176, of, san, guo, bei, meng, hui, bian, that, ships, made, in, fujian, are, the, best, ones, therefore, the, best, shipbuilders, and, laborers, were, brought, from, these, places, to, support, zheng, he, s, expedition, the, shipyard, was, under, the, command, of, ministry, of, public, works, the, shipbuilders, had, no, control, over, their, lives, the, builders, commoner, s, doctors, cooks, and, errands, had, lowest, social, status, the, shipbuilders, were, forced, to, move, away, from, their, hometown, to, the, shipyards, there, were, two, major, ways, to, enter, the, shipbuilder, occupation, family, tradition, or, apprenticeship, if, a, shipbuilder, entered, the, occupation, due, to, family, tradition, the, shipbuilder, learned, the, techniques, of, shipbuilding, from, his, family, and, is, very, likely, to, earn, a, higher, status, in, the, shipyard, additionally, the, shipbuilder, had, access, to, business, networking, that, could, help, to, find, clients, if, a, shipbuilder, entered, the, occupation, through, an, apprenticeship, the, shipbuilder, was, likely, a, farmer, before, he, was, hired, as, a, shipbuilder, or, he, was, previously, an, experienced, shipbuilder, many, shipbuilders, working, in, the, shipyard, were, forced, into, the, occupation, the, ships, built, for, zheng, he, s, voyages, needed, to, be, waterproof, solid, safe, and, have, ample, room, to, carry, large, amounts, of, trading, goods, therefore, due, to, the, highly, commercialized, society, that, was, being, encouraged, by, the, expeditions, trades, and, government, policies, the, shipbuilders, needed, to, acquire, the, skills, to, build, ships, that, fulfil, these, requirements, shipbuilding, was, not, the, sole, industry, utilising, chinese, lumber, at, that, time, the, new, capital, was, being, built, in, beijing, from, approximately, 1407, onwards, which, required, huge, amounts, of, high, quality, wood, these, two, ambitious, projects, commissioned, by, emperor, yongle, would, have, had, enormous, environmental, and, economic, effects, even, if, the, ships, were, half, the, dimensions, given, in, the, history, of, ming, considerable, pressure, would, also, have, been, placed, on, the, infrastructure, required, to, transport, the, trees, from, their, point, of, origin, to, the, shipyards, shipbuilders, were, usually, divided, into, different, groups, and, had, separate, jobs, some, were, responsible, for, fixing, old, ships, some, were, responsible, for, making, the, keel, and, some, were, responsible, for, building, the, helm, after, 1477, the, ming, government, reversed, its, open, maritime, policies, enacting, a, series, of, isolationist, policies, in, response, to, piracy, the, policies, called, haijin, sea, ban, lasted, until, the, end, of, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1644, during, this, period, chinese, navigation, technology, did, not, make, any, progress, and, even, declined, in, some, aspect, in, the, islamic, world, shipbuilding, thrived, at, basra, and, alexandria, the, dhow, felucca, baghlah, and, the, sambuk, became, symbols, of, successful, maritime, trade, around, the, indian, ocean, from, the, ports, of, east, africa, to, southeast, asia, and, the, ports, of, sindh, and, hind, india, during, the, abbasid, period, mughal, empire, had, a, large, shipbuilding, industry, which, was, largely, centred, in, the, bengal, subah, economic, historian, indrajit, ray, estimates, shipbuilding, output, of, bengal, during, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, at, 223, 250, tons, annually, compared, with, 23, 061, tons, produced, in, nineteen, colonies, in, north, america, from, 1769, to, 1771, he, also, assesses, ship, repairing, as, very, advanced, in, bengal, shipbuilding, in, bengal, was, advanced, compared, to, european, shipbuilding, at, the, time, with, bengal, selling, ships, to, european, firms, an, important, innovation, in, shipbuilding, was, the, introduction, of, a, flushed, deck, design, in, bengal, rice, ships, resulting, in, hulls, that, were, stronger, and, less, prone, to, leak, than, the, structurally, weak, hulls, of, traditional, european, ships, built, with, a, stepped, deck, design, the, british, east, india, company, later, duplicated, the, flushed, deck, and, hull, designs, of, bengal, rice, ships, in, the, 1760s, leading, to, significant, improvements, in, seaworthiness, and, navigation, for, european, ships, during, the, industrial, revolution, documents, from, 1506, for, example, refer, to, watercraft, on, the, sierra, leone, river, carrying, 120, men, others, refer, to, guinea, coast, peoples, using, war, canoes, of, varying, sizes, some, 70, feet, in, length, 7, 8, feet, broad, with, sharp, pointed, ends, rowing, benches, on, the, side, and, quarterdecks, or, forecastles, build, of, reeds, the, watercraft, included, miscellaneous, facilities, such, as, cooking, hearths, and, storage, spaces, for, the, crew, s, sleeping, mats, from, the, 17th, century, some, kingdoms, added, brass, or, iron, cannons, to, their, vessels, by, the, 18th, century, however, the, use, of, swivel, cannons, on, war, canoes, accelerated, the, city, state, of, lagos, for, instance, deployed, war, canoes, armed, with, swivel, cannons, with, the, development, of, the, carrack, the, west, moved, into, a, new, era, of, ship, construction, by, building, the, first, regular, oceangoing, vessels, in, a, relatively, short, time, these, ships, grew, to, an, unprecedented, size, complexity, and, cost, shipyards, became, large, industrial, complexes, and, the, ships, built, were, financed, by, consortia, of, investors, these, considerations, led, to, the, documentation, of, design, and, construction, practices, in, what, had, previously, been, a, secretive, trade, run, by, master, shipwrights, and, ultimately, led, to, the, field, of, naval, architecture, in, which, professional, designers, and, draftsmen, played, an, increasingly, important, role, even, so, construction, techniques, changed, only, very, gradually, the, ships, of, the, napoleonic, wars, were, still, built, more, or, less, to, the, same, basic, plan, as, those, of, the, spanish, armada, of, two, centuries, earlier, although, there, had, been, numerous, subtle, improvements, in, ship, design, and, construction, throughout, this, period, for, instance, the, introduction, of, tumblehome, adjustments, to, the, shapes, of, sails, and, hulls, the, introduction, of, the, wheel, the, introduction, of, hardened, copper, fastenings, below, the, waterline, the, introduction, of, copper, sheathing, as, a, deterrent, to, shipworm, and, fouling, etc, in, the, early, decades, of, the, industrial, revolution, 1760, to, 1825, western, ship, design, remained, largely, based, on, its, traditional, pre, industrial, designs, and, materials, and, yet, greatly, improved, in, safety, as, the, risk, of, being, wrecked, for, atlantic, shipping, fell, by, one, third, and, of, foundering, by, two, thirds, reflecting, improvements, in, seaworthiness, and, navigation, respectively, the, improvement, in, seaworthiness, has, been, credited, to, adopting, the, stronger, flushed, deck, design, derived, from, indian, designs, and, the, increasing, use, of, iron, reinforcement, the, flushed, deck, originated, from, the, bengal, rice, ships, with, bengal, being, famous, for, its, shipbuilding, industry, at, the, time, iron, was, gradually, adopted, in, ship, construction, initially, to, provide, stronger, joints, in, a, wooden, hull, e, g, as, deck, knees, hanging, knees, knee, riders, and, the, other, sharp, joints, ones, in, which, a, curved, progressive, joint, could, not, be, achieved, one, study, finds, that, there, were, considerable, improvements, in, ship, speed, from, 1750, to, 1850, we, find, that, average, sailing, speeds, of, british, ships, in, moderate, to, strong, winds, rose, by, nearly, a, third, driving, this, steady, progress, seems, to, be, the, continuous, evolution, of, sails, and, rigging, and, improved, hulls, that, allowed, a, greater, area, of, sail, to, be, set, safely, in, a, given, wind, by, contrast, looking, at, every, voyage, between, the, netherlands, and, east, indies, undertaken, by, the, dutch, east, india, company, from, 1595, to, 1795, we, find, that, journey, time, fell, only, by, 10, percent, with, no, improvement, in, the, heavy, mortality, averaging, six, percent, per, voyage, of, those, aboard, initially, copying, wooden, construction, traditions, with, a, frame, over, which, the, hull, was, fastened, isambard, kingdom, brunel, s, great, britain, of, 1843, was, the, first, radical, new, design, being, built, entirely, of, wrought, iron, despite, her, success, and, the, great, savings, in, cost, and, space, provided, by, the, iron, hull, compared, to, a, copper, sheathed, counterpart, there, remained, problems, with, fouling, due, to, the, adherence, of, weeds, and, barnacles, as, a, result, composite, construction, remained, the, dominant, approach, where, fast, ships, were, required, with, wooden, timbers, laid, over, an, iron, frame, cutty, sark, is, a, famous, example, later, great, britain, s, iron, hull, was, sheathed, in, wood, to, enable, it, to, carry, a, copper, based, sheathing, brunel, s, great, eastern, represented, the, next, great, development, in, shipbuilding, built, in, association, with, john, scott, russell, it, used, longitudinal, stringers, for, strength, inner, and, outer, hulls, and, bulkheads, to, form, multiple, watertight, compartments, steel, also, supplanted, wrought, iron, when, it, became, readily, available, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, providing, great, savings, when, compared, with, iron, in, cost, and, weight, wood, continued, to, be, favored, for, the, decks, during, world, war, ii, the, need, for, cargo, ships, was, so, great, that, construction, time, for, liberty, ships, went, from, initially, eight, months, or, longer, down, to, weeks, or, even, days, they, employed, production, line, and, prefabrication, techniques, such, as, those, used, in, shipyards, today, the, total, number, of, dry, cargo, ships, built, in, the, united, states, in, a, 15, year, period, just, before, the, war, was, a, grand, total, of, two, during, the, war, thousands, of, liberty, ships, and, victory, ships, were, built, many, of, them, in, shipyards, that, did, not, exist, before, the, war, and, they, were, built, by, a, workforce, consisting, largely, of, women, and, other, inexperienced, workers, who, had, never, seen, a, ship, before, or, even, the, ocean, after, world, war, ii, shipbuilding, which, encompasses, the, shipyards, the, marine, equipment, manufacturers, and, many, related, service, and, knowledge, providers, grew, as, an, important, and, strategic, industry, in, a, number, of, countries, around, the, world, this, importance, stems, from, historically, the, industry, has, suffered, from, the, absence, of, global, rules, and, a, tendency, towards, state, supported, over, investment, due, to, the, fact, that, shipyards, offer, a, wide, range, of, technologies, employ, a, significant, number, of, workers, and, generate, income, as, the, shipbuilding, market, is, global, japan, used, shipbuilding, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, to, rebuild, its, industrial, structure, south, korea, started, to, make, shipbuilding, a, strategic, industry, in, the, 1970s, and, china, is, now, in, the, process, of, repeating, these, models, with, large, state, supported, investments, in, this, industry, conversely, croatia, is, privatising, its, shipbuilding, industry, as, a, result, the, world, shipbuilding, market, suffers, from, over, capacities, depressed, prices, although, the, industry, experienced, a, price, increase, in, the, period, 2003, 2005, due, to, strong, demand, for, new, ships, which, was, in, excess, of, actual, cost, increases, low, profit, margins, trade, distortions, and, widespread, subsidisation, all, efforts, to, address, the, problems, in, the, oecd, have, so, far, failed, with, the, 1994, international, shipbuilding, agreement, never, entering, into, force, and, the, 2003, 2005, round, of, negotiations, being, paused, in, september, 2005, after, no, agreement, was, possible, after, numerous, efforts, to, restart, the, negotiations, these, were, formally, terminated, in, december, 2010, the, oecd, s, council, working, party, on, shipbuilding, wp6, will, continue, its, efforts, to, identify, and, progressively, reduce, factors, that, distort, the, shipbuilding, market, where, state, subsidies, have, been, removed, and, domestic, industrial, policies, do, not, provide, support, in, high, labor, cost, countries, shipbuilding, has, gone, into, decline, the, british, shipbuilding, industry, is, a, prime, example, of, this, with, its, industries, suffering, badly, from, the, 1960s, in, the, early, 1970s, british, yards, still, had, the, capacity, to, build, all, types, and, sizes, of, merchant, ships, but, today, they, have, been, reduced, to, a, small, number, specialising, in, defence, contracts, luxury, yachts, and, repair, work, decline, has, also, occurred, in, other, european, countries, although, to, some, extent, this, has, reduced, by, protective, measures, and, industrial, support, policies, in, the, us, the, jones, act, which, places, restrictions, on, the, ships, that, can, be, used, for, moving, domestic, cargoes, has, meant, that, merchant, shipbuilding, has, continued, albeit, at, a, reduced, rate, but, such, protection, has, failed, to, penalise, shipbuilding, inefficiencies, the, consequence, of, this, is, that, contract, prices, are, far, higher, than, those, of, any, other, country, building, oceangoing, ships, beyond, the, 2000s, the, three, east, asian, manufacturing, powerhouses, china,

began, to, decline, in, the, 1960s, as, they, lost, work, to, japan, in, the, same, way, japan, most, recently, lost, their, work, to, south, korea, and, china, over, the, four, years, from, 2007, the, total, number, of, employees, in, the, european, shipbuilding, industry, declined, from, 150, 000, to, 115, 000, in, 2022, some, key, shipbuilders, in, europe, are, fincantieri, damen, group,

with, good, properties, for, ship, construction, have, been, used, although, it, is, commonly, accepted, that, modern, steel, has, eliminated, brittle, fracture, in, ships, some, controversy, still, exists, brittle, fracture, of, modern, vessels, continues, to, occur, from, time, to, time, because, grade, a, and, grade, b, steel, of, unknown, toughness, or, fracture, appearance, transition,
