linux, l, n, k, s, lin, uuks, is, a, generic, name, for, a, family, of, open, source, unix, like, operating, systems, based, on, the, linux, kernel, an, operating, system, kernel, first, released, on, september, 17, 1991, by, linus, torvalds, linux, is, typically, packaged, as, a, linux, distribution, distro, which, includes, the, kernel, and, supporting, system, software, and, libraries, many, of, which, are, provided, by, the, gnu, project, popular, linux, distributions, include, debian, fedora, linux, arch, linux, and, ubuntu, commercial, distributions, include, red, hat, enterprise, linux, and, suse, linux, enterprise, desktop, linux, distributions, include, a, windowing, system, such, as, x11, or, wayland, and, a, desktop, environment, such, as, gnome, kde, plasma, or, xfce, distributions, intended, for, servers, may, not, have, a, graphical, user, interface, at, all, or, include, a, solution, stack, such, as, lamp, many, linux, distributions, use, the, word, linux, in, their, name, but, the, free, software, foundation, uses, and, recommends, the, name, gnu, linux, to, emphasize, the, use, and, importance, of, gnu, software, in, many, distributions, causing, some, controversy, because, linux, is, freely, redistributable, anyone, may, create, a, distribution, for, any, purpose, linux, was, originally, developed, for, personal, computers, based, on, the, intel, x86, architecture, but, has, since, been, ported, to, more, platforms, than, any, other, operating, system, because, of, the, dominance, of, linux, based, android, on, smartphones, linux, including, android, has, the, largest, installed, base, of, all, general, purpose, operating, systems, as, of, may, 2022, linux, is, as, of, march, 2024, used, by, around, 4, percent, of, desktop, computers, the, chromebook, which, runs, the, linux, kernel, based, chromeos, dominates, the, us, k, 12, education, market, and, represents, nearly, 20, percent, of, sub, 300, notebook, sales, in, the, us, linux, is, the, leading, operating, system, on, servers, over, 96, 4, of, the, top, one, million, web, servers, operating, systems, are, linux, leads, other, big, iron, systems, such, as, mainframe, computers, and, is, used, on, all, of, the, world, s, 500, fastest, supercomputers, as, of, november, 2017, having, gradually, displaced, all, competitors, linux, also, runs, on, embedded, systems, i, e, devices, whose, operating, system, is, typically, built, into, the, firmware, and, is, highly, tailored, to, the, system, this, includes, routers, automation, controls, smart, home, devices, video, game, consoles, televisions, samsung, and, lg, smart, tvs, automobiles, tesla, audi, mercedes, benz, hyundai, and, toyota, and, spacecraft, falcon, 9, rocket, dragon, crew, capsule, and, the, perseverance, rover, linux, is, one, of, the, most, prominent, examples, of, free, and, open, source, software, collaboration, the, source, code, may, be, used, modified, and, distributed, commercially, or, non, commercially, by, anyone, under, the, terms, of, its, respective, licenses, such, as, the, gnu, general, public, license, gpl, the, linux, kernel, for, example, is, licensed, under, the, gplv2, with, an, exception, for, system, calls, that, allows, code, that, calls, the, kernel, via, system, calls, not, to, be, licensed, under, the, gpl, the, unix, operating, system, was, conceived, and, implemented, in, 1969, at, at, t, s, bell, labs, in, the, united, states, by, ken, thompson, dennis, ritchie, douglas, mcilroy, and, joe, ossanna, first, released, in, 1971, unix, was, written, entirely, in, assembly, language, as, was, common, practice, at, the, time, in, 1973, in, a, key, pioneering, approach, it, was, rewritten, in, the, c, programming, language, by, dennis, ritchie, except, for, some, hardware, and, i, o, routines, the, availability, of, a, high, level, language, implementation, of, unix, made, its, porting, to, different, computer, platforms, easier, due, to, an, earlier, antitrust, case, forbidding, it, from, entering, the, computer, business, at, t, licensed, the, operating, system, s, source, code, as, a, trade, secret, to, anyone, who, asked, as, a, result, unix, grew, quickly, and, became, widely, adopted, by, academic, institutions, and, businesses, in, 1984, at, t, divested, itself, of, its, regional, operating, companies, and, was, released, from, its, obligation, not, to, enter, the, computer, business, freed, of, that, obligation, bell, labs, began, selling, unix, as, a, proprietary, product, where, users, were, not, legally, allowed, to, modify, it, onyx, systems, began, selling, early, microcomputer, based, unix, workstations, in, 1980, later, sun, microsystems, founded, as, a, spin, off, of, a, student, project, at, stanford, university, also, began, selling, unix, based, desktop, workstations, in, 1982, while, sun, workstations, did, not, use, commodity, pc, hardware, for, which, linux, was, later, originally, developed, it, represented, the, first, successful, commercial, attempt, at, distributing, a, primarily, single, user, microcomputer, that, ran, a, unix, operating, system, with, unix, increasingly, locked, in, as, a, proprietary, product, the, gnu, project, started, in, 1983, by, richard, stallman, had, the, goal, of, creating, a, complete, unix, compatible, software, system, composed, entirely, of, free, software, work, began, in, 1984, later, in, 1985, stallman, started, the, free, software, foundation, and, wrote, the, gnu, general, public, license, gnu, gpl, in, 1989, by, the, early, 1990s, many, of, the, programs, required, in, an, operating, system, such, as, libraries, compilers, text, editors, a, command, line, shell, and, a, windowing, system, were, completed, although, low, level, elements, such, as, device, drivers, daemons, and, the, kernel, called, gnu, hurd, were, stalled, and, incomplete, minix, was, created, by, andrew, s, tanenbaum, a, computer, science, professor, and, released, in, 1987, as, a, minimal, unix, like, operating, system, targeted, at, students, and, others, who, wanted, to, learn, operating, system, principles, although, the, complete, source, code, of, minix, was, freely, available, the, licensing, terms, prevented, it, from, being, free, software, until, the, licensing, changed, in, april, 2000, although, not, released, until, 1992, due, to, legal, complications, the, development, of, 386bsd, from, which, netbsd, openbsd, and, freebsd, descended, predated, that, of, linux, linus, torvalds, has, stated, on, separate, occasions, that, if, the, gnu, kernel, or, 386bsd, had, been, available, at, the, time, 1991, he, probably, would, not, have, created, linux, while, attending, the, university, of, helsinki, in, the, fall, of, 1990, torvalds, enrolled, in, a, unix, course, the, course, used, a, microvax, minicomputer, running, ultrix, and, one, of, the, required, texts, was, operating, systems, design, and, implementation, by, andrew, s, tanenbaum, this, textbook, included, a, copy, of, tanenbaum, s, minix, operating, system, it, was, with, this, course, that, torvalds, first, became, exposed, to, unix, in, 1991, he, became, curious, about, operating, systems, frustrated, by, the, licensing, of, minix, which, at, the, time, limited, it, to, educational, use, only, he, began, to, work, on, his, operating, system, kernel, which, eventually, became, the, linux, kernel, on, july, 3, 1991, to, implement, unix, system, calls, linus, torvalds, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, obtain, a, digital, copy, of, the, posix, standards, documentation, with, a, request, to, the, comp, os, minix, newsgroup, after, not, finding, the, posix, documentation, torvalds, initially, resorted, to, determining, system, calls, from, sunos, documentation, owned, by, the, university, for, use, in, operating, its, sun, microsystems, server, he, also, learned, some, system, calls, from, tanenbaum, s, minix, text, torvalds, began, the, development, of, the, linux, kernel, on, minix, and, applications, written, for, minix, were, also, used, on, linux, later, linux, matured, and, further, linux, kernel, development, took, place, on, linux, systems, gnu, applications, also, replaced, all, minix, components, because, it, was, advantageous, to, use, the, freely, available, code, from, the, gnu, project, with, the, fledgling, operating, system, code, licensed, under, the, gnu, gpl, can, be, reused, in, other, computer, programs, as, long, as, they, also, are, released, under, the, same, or, a, compatible, license, torvalds, initiated, a, switch, from, his, original, license, which, prohibited, commercial, redistribution, to, the, gnu, gpl, developers, worked, to, integrate, gnu, components, with, the, linux, kernel, creating, a, fully, functional, and, free, operating, system, linus, torvalds, had, wanted, to, call, his, invention, freax, a, portmanteau, of, free, freak, and, x, as, an, allusion, to, unix, during, the, start, of, his, work, on, the, system, some, of, the, project, s, makefiles, included, the, name, freax, for, about, half, a, year, initially, torvalds, considered, the, name, linux, but, dismissed, it, as, too, egotistical, to, facilitate, development, the, files, were, uploaded, to, the, ftp, server, ftp, funet, fi, of, funet, in, september, 1991, ari, lemmke, torvalds, coworker, at, the, helsinki, university, of, technology, hut, who, was, one, of, the, volunteer, administrators, for, the, ftp, server, at, the, time, did, not, think, that, freax, was, a, good, name, so, he, named, the, project, linux, on, the, server, without, consulting, torvalds, later, however, torvalds, consented, to, linux, according, to, a, newsgroup, post, by, torvalds, the, word, linux, should, be, pronounced, l, n, k, s, lin, uuks, with, a, short, i, as, in, print, and, u, as, in, put, to, further, demonstrate, how, the, word, linux, should, be, pronounced, he, included, an, audio, guide, with, the, kernel, source, code, however, in, this, recording, he, pronounces, linux, as, lin, ks, leen, uuks, with, a, short, but, close, front, unrounded, vowel, instead, of, a, near, close, near, front, unrounded, vowel, as, in, his, newsgroup, post, the, adoption, of, linux, in, production, environments, rather, than, being, used, only, by, hobbyists, started, to, take, off, first, in, the, mid, 1990s, in, the, supercomputing, community, where, organizations, such, as, nasa, started, to, replace, their, increasingly, expensive, machines, with, clusters, of, inexpensive, commodity, computers, running, linux, commercial, use, began, when, dell, and, ibm, followed, by, hewlett, packard, started, offering, linux, support, to, escape, microsoft, s, monopoly, in, the, desktop, operating, system, market, today, linux, systems, are, used, throughout, computing, from, embedded, systems, to, virtually, all, supercomputers, and, have, secured, a, place, in, server, installations, such, as, the, popular, lamp, application, stack, the, use, of, linux, distributions, in, home, and, enterprise, desktops, has, been, growing, linux, distributions, have, also, become, popular, in, the, netbook, market, with, many, devices, shipping, with, customized, linux, distributions, installed, and, google, releasing, their, own, chromeos, designed, for, netbooks, linux, s, greatest, success, in, the, consumer, market, is, perhaps, the, mobile, device, market, with, android, being, the, dominant, operating, system, on, smartphones, and, very, popular, on, tablets, and, more, recently, on, wearables, linux, gaming, is, also, on, the, rise, with, valve, showing, its, support, for, linux, and, rolling, out, steamos, its, own, gaming, oriented, linux, distribution, which, was, later, implemented, in, their, steam, deck, platform, linux, distributions, have, also, gained, popularity, with, various, local, and, national, governments, such, as, the, federal, government, of, brazil, linus, torvalds, is, the, lead, maintainer, for, the, linux, kernel, and, guides, its, development, while, greg, kroah, hartman, is, the, lead, maintainer, for, the, stable, branch, zo, kooyman, is, the, executive, director, of, the, free, software, foundation, which, in, turn, supports, the, gnu, components, finally, individuals, and, corporations, develop, third, party, non, gnu, components, these, third, party, components, comprise, a, vast, body, of, work, and, may, include, both, kernel, modules, and, user, applications, and, libraries, linux, vendors, and, communities, combine, and, distribute, the, kernel, gnu, components, and, non, gnu, components, with, additional, package, management, software, in, the, form, of, linux, distributions, many, developers, of, open, source, software, agree, that, the, linux, kernel, was, not, designed, but, rather, evolved, through, natural, selection, torvalds, considers, that, although, the, design, of, unix, served, as, a, scaffolding, linux, grew, with, a, lot, of, mutations, and, because, the, mutations, were, less, than, random, they, were, faster, and, more, directed, than, alpha, particles, in, dna, eric, s, raymond, considers, linux, s, revolutionary, aspects, to, be, social, not, technical, before, linux, complex, software, was, designed, carefully, by, small, groups, but, linux, evolved, in, a, completely, different, way, from, nearly, the, beginning, it, was, rather, casually, hacked, on, by, huge, numbers, of, volunteers, coordinating, only, through, the, internet, quality, was, maintained, not, by, rigid, standards, or, autocracy, but, by, the, naively, simple, strategy, of, releasing, every, week, and, getting, feedback, from, hundreds, of, users, within, days, creating, a, sort, of, rapid, darwinian, selection, on, the, mutations, introduced, by, developers, bryan, cantrill, an, engineer, of, a, competing, os, agrees, that, linux, wasn, t, designed, it, evolved, but, considers, this, to, be, a, limitation, proposing, that, some, features, especially, those, related, to, security, cannot, be, evolved, into, this, is, not, a, biological, system, at, the, end, of, the, day, it, s, a, software, system, a, linux, based, system, is, a, modular, unix, like, operating, system, deriving, much, of, its, basic, design, from, principles, established, in, unix, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, such, a, system, uses, a, monolithic, kernel, the, linux, kernel, which, handles, process, control, networking, access, to, the, peripherals, and, file, systems, device, drivers, are, either, integrated, directly, with, the, kernel, or, added, as, modules, that, are, loaded, while, the, system, is, running, the, gnu, userland, is, a, key, part, of, most, systems, based, on, the, linux, kernel, with, android, being, the, notable, exception, the, gnu, c, library, an, implementation, of, the, c, standard, library, works, as, a, wrapper, for, the, system, calls, of, the, linux, kernel, necessary, to, the, kernel, userspace, interface, the, toolchain, is, a, broad, collection, of, programming, tools, vital, to, linux, development, including, the, compilers, used, to, build, the, linux, kernel, itself, and, the, coreutils, implement, many, basic, unix, tools, the, gnu, project, also, develops, bash, a, popular, cli, shell, the, graphical, user, interface, or, gui, used, by, most, linux, systems, is, built, on, top, of, an, implementation, of, the, x, window, system, more, recently, the, linux, community, has, sought, to, advance, to, wayland, as, the, new, display, server, protocol, in, place, of, x11, many, other, open, source, software, projects, contribute, to, linux, systems, installed, components, of, a, linux, system, include, the, following, the, user, interface, also, known, as, the, shell, is, either, a, command, line, interface, cli, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, or, controls, attached, to, the, associated, hardware, which, is, common, for, embedded, systems, for, desktop, systems, the, default, user, interface, is, usually, graphical, although, the, cli, is, commonly, available, through, terminal, emulator, windows, or, on, a, separate, virtual, console, cli, shells, are, text, based, user, interfaces, which, use, text, for, both, input, and, output, the, dominant, shell, used, in, linux, is, the, bourne, again, shell, bash, originally, developed, for, the, gnu, project, most, low, level, linux, components, including, various, parts, of, the, userland, use, the, cli, exclusively, the, cli, is, particularly, suited, for, automation, of, repetitive, or, delayed, tasks, and, provides, very, simple, inter, process, communication, on, desktop, systems, the, most, popular, user, interfaces, are, the, gui, shells, packaged, together, with, extensive, desktop, environments, such, as, kde, plasma, gnome, mate, cinnamon, lxde, pantheon, and, xfce, though, a, variety, of, additional, user, interfaces, exist, most, popular, user, interfaces, are, based, on, the, x, window, system, often, simply, called, x, it, provides, network, transparency, and, permits, a, graphical, application, running, on, one, system, to, be, displayed, on, another, where, a, user, may, interact, with, the, application, however, certain, extensions, of, the, x, window, system, are, not, capable, of, working, over, the, network, several, x, display, servers, exist, with, the, reference, implementation, x, org, server, being, the, most, popular, server, distributions, might, provide, a, command, line, interface, for, developers, and, administrators, but, provide, a, custom, interface, for, end, users, designed, for, the, use, case, of, the, system, this, custom, interface, is, accessed, through, a, client, that, resides, on, another, system, not, necessarily, linux, based, several, types, of, window, managers, exist, for, x11, including, tiling, dynamic, stacking, and, compositing, window, managers, provide, means, to, control, the, placement, and, appearance, of, individual, application, windows, and, interact, with, the, x, window, system, simpler, x, window, managers, such, as, dwm, ratpoison, or, i3wm, provide, a, minimalist, functionality, while, more, elaborate, window, managers, such, as, fvwm, enlightenment, or, window, maker, provide, more, features, such, as, a, built, in, taskbar, and, themes, but, are, still, lightweight, when, compared, to, desktop, environments, desktop, environments, include, window, managers, as, part, of, their, standard, installations, such, as, mutter, gnome, kwin, kde, or, xfwm, xfce, although, users, may, choose, to, use, a, different, window, manager, if, preferred, wayland, is, a, display, server, protocol, intended, as, a, replacement, for, the, x11, protocol, as, of, 2022, it, has, received, relatively, wide, adoption, unlike, x11, wayland, does, not, need, an, external, window, manager, and, compositing, manager, therefore, a, wayland, compositor, takes, the, role, of, the, display, server, window, manager, and, compositing, manager, weston, is, the, reference, implementation, of, wayland, while, gnome, s, mutter, and, kde, s, kwin, are, being, ported, to, wayland, as, standalone, display, servers, enlightenment, has, already, been, successfully, ported, since, version, 19, additionally, many, window, managers, have, been, made, for, wayland, such, as, sway, or, hyprland, as, well, as, other, graphical, utilities, such, as, waybar, or, rofi, linux, currently, has, two, modern, kernel, userspace, apis, for, handling, video, input, devices, v4l2, api, for, video, streams, and, radio, and, dvb, api, for, digital, tv, reception, due, to, the, complexity, and, diversity, of, different, devices, and, due, to, the, large, number, of, formats, and, standards, handled, by, those, apis, this, infrastructure, needs, to, evolve, to, better, fit, other, devices, also, a, good, userspace, device, library, is, the, key, to, the, success, of, having, userspace, applications, to, be, able, to, work, with, all, formats, supported, by, those, devices, the, primary, difference, between, linux, and, many, other, popular, contemporary, operating, systems, is, that, the, linux, kernel, and, other, components, are, free, and, open, source, software, linux, is, not, the, only, such, operating, system, although, it, is, by, far, the, most, widely, used, some, free, and, open, source, software, licenses, are, based, on, the, principle, of, copyleft, a, kind, of, reciprocity, any, work, derived, from, a, copyleft, piece, of, software, must, also, be, copyleft, itself, the, most, common, free, software, license, the, gnu, general, public, license, gpl, is, a, form, of, copyleft, and, is, used, for, the, linux, kernel, and, many, of, the, components, from, the, gnu, project, linux, based, distributions, are, intended, by, developers, for, interoperability, with, other, operating, systems, and, established, computing, standards, linux, systems, adhere, to, posix, sus, lsb, iso, and, ansi, standards, where, possible, although, to, date, only, one, linux, distribution, has, been, posix, 1, certified, linux, ft, free, software, projects, although, developed, through, collaboration, are, often, produced, independently, of, each, other, the, fact, that, the, software, licenses, explicitly, permit, redistribution, however, provides, a, basis, for, larger, scale, projects, that, collect, the, software, produced, by, stand, alone, projects, and, make, it, available, all, at, once, in, the, form, of, a, linux, distribution, many, linux, distributions, manage, a, remote, collection, of, system, software, and, application, software, packages, available, for, download, and, installation, through, a, network, connection, this, allows, users, to, adapt, the, operating, system, to, their, specific, needs, distributions, are, maintained, by, individuals, loose, knit, teams, volunteer, organizations, and, commercial, entities, a, distribution, is, responsible, for, the, default, configuration, of, the, installed, linux, kernel, general, system, security, and, more, generally, integration, of, the, different, software, packages, into, a, coherent, whole, distributions, typically, use, a, package, manager, such, as, apt, yum, zypper, pacman, or, portage, to, install, remove, and, update, all, of, a, system, s, software, from, one, central, location, a, distribution, is, largely, driven, by, its, developer, and, user, communities, some, vendors, develop, and, fund, their, distributions, on, a, volunteer, basis, debian, being, a, well, known, example, others, maintain, a, community, version, of, their, commercial, distributions, as, red, hat, does, with, fedora, and, suse, does, with, opensuse, in, many, cities, and, regions, local, associations, known, as, linux, user, groups, lugs, seek, to, promote, their, preferred, distribution, and, by, extension, free, software, they, hold, meetings, and, provide, free, demonstrations, training, technical, support, and, operating, system, installation, to, new, users, many, internet, communities, also, provide, support, to, linux, users, and, developers, most, distributions, and, free, software, open, source, projects, have, irc, chatrooms, or, newsgroups, online, forums, are, another, means, of, support, with, notable, examples, being, linuxquestions, org, and, the, various, distribution, specific, support, and, community, forums, such, as, ones, for, ubuntu, fedora, arch, linux, gentoo, etc, linux, distributions, host, mailing, lists, commonly, there, will, be, a, specific, topic, such, as, usage, or, development, for, a, given, list, there, are, several, technology, websites, with, a, linux, focus, print, magazines, on, linux, often, bundle, cover, disks, that, carry, software, or, even, complete, linux, distributions, although, linux, distributions, are, generally, available, without, charge, several, large, corporations, sell, support, and, contribute, to, the, development, of, the, components, of, the, system, and, free, software, an, analysis, of, the, linux, kernel, in, 2017, showed, that, well, over, 85, of, the, code, was, developed, by, programmers, who, are, being, paid, for, their, work, leaving, about, 8, 2, to, unpaid, developers, and, 4, 1, unclassified, some, of, the, major, corporations, that, provide, contributions, include, intel, samsung, google, amd, oracle, and, facebook, several, corporations, notably, red, hat, canonical, and, suse, have, built, a, significant, business, around, linux, distributions, the, free, software, licenses, on, which, the, various, software, packages, of, a, distribution, built, on, the, linux, kernel, are, based, explicitly, accommodate, and, encourage, commercialization, the, relationship, between, a, linux, distribution, as, a, whole, and, individual, vendors, may, be, seen, as, symbiotic, one, common, business, model, of, commercial, suppliers, is, charging, for, support, especially, for, business, users, a, number, of, companies, also, offer, a, specialized, business, version, of, their, distribution, which, adds, proprietary, support, packages, and, tools, to, administer, higher, numbers, of, installations, or, to, simplify, administrative, tasks, another, business, model, is, to, give, away, the, software, to, sell, hardware, this, used, to, be, the, norm, in, the, computer, industry, with, operating, systems, such, as, cp, m, apple, dos, and, versions, of, the, classic, mac, os, before, 7, 6, freely, copyable, but, not, modifiable, as, computer, hardware, standardized, throughout, the, 1980s, it, became, more, difficult, for, hardware, manufacturers, to, profit, from, this, tactic, as, the, os, would, run, on, any, manufacturer, s, computer, that, shared, the, same, architecture, most, programming, languages, support, linux, either, directly, or, through, third, party, community, based, ports, the, original, development, tools, used, for, building, both, linux, applications, and, operating, system, programs, are, found, within, the, gnu, toolchain, which, includes, the, gnu, compiler, collection, gcc, and, the, gnu, build, system, amongst, others, gcc, provides, compilers, for, ada, c, c, go, and, fortran, many, programming, languages, have, a, cross, platform, reference, implementation, that, supports, linux, for, example, php, perl, ruby, python, java, go, rust, and, haskell, first, released, in, 2003, the, llvm, project, provides, an, alternative, cross, platform, open, source, compiler, for, many, languages, proprietary, compilers, for, linux, include, the, intel, c, compiler, sun, studio, and, ibm, xl, c, c, compiler, basic, is, available, in, procedural, form, from, qb64, purebasic, yabasic, glbasic, basic4gl, xbasic, wxbasic, sdlbasic, and, basic, 256, as, well, as, object, oriented, through, gambas, freebasic, b4x, basic, for, qt, phoenix, object, basic, ns, basic, providex, chipmunk, basic, rapidq, and, xojo, pascal, is, implemented, through, gnu, pascal, free, pascal, and, virtual, pascal, as, well, as, graphically, via, lazarus, pascalabc, net, or, delphi, using, firemonkey, previously, through, borland, kylix, a, common, feature, of, unix, like, systems, linux, includes, traditional, specific, purpose, programming, languages, targeted, at, scripting, text, processing, and, system, configuration, and, management, in, general, linux, distributions, support, shell, scripts, awk, sed, and, make, many, programs, also, have, an, embedded, programming, language, to, support, configuring, or, programming, themselves, for, example, regular, expressions, are, supported, in, programs, like, grep, and, locate, the, traditional, unix, message, transfer, agent, sendmail, contains, its, own, turing, complete, scripting, system, and, the, advanced, text, editor, gnu, emacs, is, built, around, a, general, purpose, lisp, interpreter, most, distributions, also, include, support, for, php, perl, ruby, python, and, other, dynamic, languages, while, not, as, common, linux, also, supports, c, and, other, cli, languages, via, mono, vala, and, scheme, guile, scheme, acts, as, an, extension, language, targeting, the, gnu, system, utilities, seeking, to, make, the, conventionally, small, static, compiled, c, programs, of, unix, design, rapidly, and, dynamically, extensible, via, an, elegant, functional, high, level, scripting, system, many, gnu, programs, can, be, compiled, with, optional, guile, bindings, to, this, end, a, number, of, java, virtual, machines, and, development, kits, run, on, linux, including, the, original, sun, microsystems, jvm, hotspot, and, ibm, s, j2se, re, as, well, as, many, open, source, projects, like, kaffe, and, jikes, rvm, kotlin, scala, groovy, and, other, jvm, languages, are, also, available, gnome, and, kde, are, popular, desktop, environments, and, provide, a, framework, for, developing, applications, these, projects, are, based, on, the, gtk, and, qt, widget, toolkits, respectively, which, can, also, be, used, independently, of, the, larger, framework, both, support, a, wide, variety, of, languages, there, are, a, number, of, integrated, development, environments, available, including, anjuta, code, blocks, codelite, eclipse, geany, activestate, komodo, kdevelop, lazarus, monodevelop, netbeans, and, qt, creator, while, the, long, established, editors, vim, nano, and, emacs, remain, popular, the, linux, kernel, is, a, widely, ported, operating, system, kernel, available, for, devices, ranging, from, mobile, phones, to, supercomputers, it, runs, on, a, highly, diverse, range, of, computer, architectures, including, arm, based, android, smartphones, and, the, ibm, z, mainframes, specialized, distributions, and, kernel, forks, exist, for, less, mainstream, architectures, for, example, the, elks, kernel, fork, can, run, on, intel, 8086, or, intel, 80286, 16, bit, microprocessors, while, the, clinux, kernel, fork, may, run, on, systems, without, a, memory, management, unit, the, kernel, also, runs, on, architectures, that, were, only, ever, intended, to, use, a, proprietary, manufacturer, created, operating, system, such, as, macintosh, computers, with, powerpc, intel, and, apple, silicon, processors, pdas, video, game, consoles, portable, music, players, and, mobile, phones, linux, has, a, reputation, for, supporting, old, hardware, very, well, by, maintaining, standardized, drivers, for, a, long, time, there, are, several, industry, associations, and, hardware, conferences, devoted, to, maintaining, and, improving, support, for, diverse, hardware, under, linux, such, as, freedomhec, over, time, support, for, different, hardware, has, improved, in, linux, resulting, in, any, off, the, shelf, purchase, having, a, good, chance, of, being, compatible, in, 2014, a, new, initiative, was, launched, to, automatically, collect, a, database, of, all, tested, hardware, configurations, many, quantitative, studies, of, free, open, source, software, focus, on, topics, including, market, share, and, reliability, with, numerous, studies, specifically, examining, linux, the, linux, market, is, growing, and, the, linux, operating, system, market, size, is, expected, to, see, a, growth, of, 19, 2, by, 2027, reaching, 15, 64, billion, compared, to, 3, 89, billion, in, 2019, analysts, project, a, compound, annual, growth, rate, cagr, of, 13, 7, between, 2024, and, 2032, culminating, in, a, market, size, of, usd, 34, 90, billion, by, the, latter, year, analysts, and, proponents, attribute, the, relative, success, of, linux, to, its, security, reliability, low, cost, and, freedom, from, vendor, lock, in, the, linux, kernel, is, licensed, under, the, gnu, general, public, license, gpl, version, 2, the, gpl, requires, that, anyone, who, distributes, software, based, on, source, code, under, this, license, must, make, the, originating, source, code, and, any, modifications, available, to, the, recipient, under, the, same, terms, other, key, components, of, a, typical, linux, distribution, are, also, mainly, licensed, under, the, gpl, but, they, may, use, other, licenses, many, libraries, use, the, gnu, lesser, general, public, license, lgpl, a, more, permissive, variant, of, the, gpl, and, the, x, org, implementation, of, the, x, window, system, uses, the, mit, license, torvalds, states, that, the, linux, kernel, will, not, move, from, version, 2, of, the, gpl, to, version, 3, he, specifically, dislikes, some, provisions, in, the, new, license, which, prohibit, the, use, of, the, software, in, digital, rights, management, it, would, also, be, impractical, to, obtain, permission, from, all, the, copyright, holders, who, number, in, the, thousands, a, 2001, study, of, red, hat, linux, 7, 1, found, that, this, distribution, contained, 30, million, source, lines, of, code, using, the, constructive, cost, model, the, study, estimated, that, this, distribution, required, about, eight, thousand, person, years, of, development, time, according, to, the, study, if, all, this, software, had, been, developed, by, conventional, proprietary, means, it, would, have, cost, about, us, 1, 82, billion, to, develop, in, 2023, in, the, united, states, most, of, the, source, code, 71, was, written, in, the, c, programming, language, but, many, other, languages, were, used, including, c, lisp, assembly, language, perl, python, fortran, and, various, shell, scripting, languages, slightly, over, half, of, all, lines, of, code, were, licensed, under, the, gpl, the, linux, kernel, itself, was, 2, 4, million, lines, of, code, or, 8, of, the, total, in, a, later, study, the, same, analysis, was, performed, for, debian, version, 4, 0, etch, which, was, released, in, 2007, this, distribution, contained, close, to, 283, million, source, lines, of, code, and, the, study, estimated, that, it, would, have, required, about, seventy, three, thousand, man, years, and, cost, us, 10, 2, billion, in, 2023, dollars, to, develop, by, conventional, means, in, the, united, states, the, name, linux, is, a, trademark, registered, to, linus, torvalds, initially, nobody, registered, it, however, on, august, 15, 1994, william, r, della, croce, jr, filed, for, the, trademark, linux, and, then, demanded, royalties, from, linux, distributors, in, 1996, torvalds, and, some, affected, organizations, sued, him, to, have, the, trademark, assigned, to, torvalds, and, in, 1997, the, case, was, settled, the, licensing, of, the, trademark, has, since, been, handled, by, the, linux, mark, institute, lmi, torvalds, has, stated, that, he, trademarked, the, name, only, to, prevent, someone, else, from, using, it, lmi, originally, charged, a, nominal, sublicensing, fee, for, use, of, the, linux, name, as, part, of, trademarks, but, later, changed, this, in, favor, of, offering, a, free, perpetual, worldwide, sublicense, the, free, software, foundation, fsf, prefers, gnu, linux, as, the, name, when, referring, to, the, operating, system, as, a, whole, because, it, considers, linux, distributions, to, be, variants, of, the, gnu, operating, system, initiated, in, 1983, by, richard, stallman, president, of, the, fsf, the, foundation, explicitly, takes, no, issue, over, the, name, android, for, the, android, os, which, is, also, an, operating, system, based, on, the, linux, kernel, as, gnu, is, not, a, part, of, it, a, minority, of, public, figures, and, software, projects, other, than, stallman, and, the, fsf, notably, distributions, consisting, of, only, free, software, such, as, debian, which, had, been, sponsored, by, the, fsf, up, to, 1996, also, use, gnu, linux, when, referring, to, the, operating, system, as, a, whole, most, media, and, common, usage, however, refers, to, this, family, of, operating, systems, simply, as, linux, as, do, many, large, linux, distributions, for, example, suse, linux, and, red, hat, enterprise, linux, as, of, may, 2011, about, 8, to, 13, of, the, lines, of, code, of, the, linux, distribution, ubuntu, version, natty, is, made, of, gnu, components, the, range, depending, on, whether, gnome, is, considered, part, of, gnu, meanwhile, 6, is, taken, by, the, linux, kernel, increased, to, 9, when, including, its, direct, dependencies
