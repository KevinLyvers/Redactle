a, touchscreen, or, touch, screen, is, a, type, of, display, that, can, detect, touch, input, from, a, user, it, consists, of, both, an, input, device, a, touch, panel, and, an, output, device, a, visual, display, the, touch, panel, is, typically, layered, on, the, top, of, the, electronic, visual, display, of, a, device, touchscreens, are, commonly, found, in, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and, other, electronic, devices, the, display, is, often, an, lcd, amoled, or, oled, display, a, user, can, give, input, or, control, the, information, processing, system, through, simple, or, multi, touch, gestures, by, touching, the, screen, with, a, special, stylus, or, one, or, more, fingers, some, touchscreens, use, ordinary, or, specially, coated, gloves, to, work, while, others, may, only, work, using, a, special, stylus, or, pen, the, user, can, use, the, touchscreen, to, react, to, what, is, displayed, and, if, the, software, allows, to, control, how, it, is, displayed, for, example, zooming, to, increase, the, text, size, a, touchscreen, enables, the, user, to, interact, directly, with, what, is, displayed, instead, of, using, a, mouse, touchpad, or, other, such, devices, other, than, a, stylus, which, is, optional, for, most, modern, touchscreens, touchscreens, are, common, in, devices, such, as, smartphones, handheld, game, consoles, and, personal, computers, they, are, common, in, point, of, sale, pos, systems, automated, teller, machines, atms, and, electronic, voting, machines, they, can, also, be, attached, to, computers, or, as, terminals, to, networks, they, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, design, of, digital, appliances, such, as, personal, digital, assistants, pdas, and, some, e, readers, touchscreens, are, important, in, educational, settings, such, as, classrooms, or, on, college, campuses, the, popularity, of, smartphones, tablets, and, many, types, of, information, appliances, has, driven, the, demand, and, acceptance, of, common, touchscreens, for, portable, and, functional, electronics, touchscreens, are, found, in, the, medical, field, heavy, industry, automated, teller, machines, atms, and, kiosks, such, as, museum, displays, or, room, automation, where, keyboard, and, mouse, systems, do, not, allow, a, suitably, intuitive, rapid, or, accurate, interaction, by, the, user, with, the, display, s, content, historically, the, touchscreen, sensor, and, its, accompanying, controller, based, firmware, have, been, made, available, by, a, wide, array, of, after, market, system, integrators, and, not, by, display, chip, or, motherboard, manufacturers, display, manufacturers, and, chip, manufacturers, have, acknowledged, the, trend, toward, acceptance, of, touchscreens, as, a, user, interface, component, and, have, begun, to, integrate, touchscreens, into, the, fundamental, design, of, their, products, one, predecessor, of, the, modern, touchscreen, includes, stylus, based, systems, 1946, direct, light, pen, a, patent, was, filed, by, philco, company, for, a, stylus, designed, for, sports, telecasting, which, when, placed, against, an, intermediate, cathode, ray, tube, display, crt, would, amplify, and, add, to, the, original, signal, effectively, this, was, used, for, temporarily, drawing, arrows, or, circles, onto, a, live, television, broadcast, as, described, in, us, 2487641a, denk, william, e, electronic, pointer, for, television, images, issued, 1949, 11, 08, 1962, optical, the, first, version, of, a, touchscreen, which, operated, independently, of, the, light, produced, from, the, screen, was, patented, by, at, t, corporation, us, 3016421a, harmon, leon, d, electrographic, transmitter, issued, 1962, 01, 09, this, touchscreen, utilized, a, matrix, of, collimated, lights, shining, orthogonally, across, the, touch, surface, when, a, beam, is, interrupted, by, a, stylus, the, photodetectors, which, no, longer, are, receiving, a, signal, can, be, used, to, determine, where, the, interruption, is, later, iterations, of, matrix, based, touchscreens, built, upon, this, by, adding, more, emitters, and, detectors, to, improve, resolution, pulsing, emitters, to, improve, optical, signal, to, noise, ratio, and, a, nonorthogonal, matrix, to, remove, shadow, readings, when, using, multi, touch, 1963, indirect, light, pen, later, inventions, built, upon, this, system, to, free, telewriting, styli, from, their, mechanical, bindings, by, transcribing, what, a, user, draws, onto, a, computer, it, could, be, saved, for, future, use, see, us, 3089918a, graham, robert, e, telewriting, apparatus, issued, 1963, 05, 14, 1965, capacitance, and, resistance, the, first, finger, driven, touchscreen, was, developed, by, eric, johnson, of, the, royal, radar, establishment, located, in, malvern, england, who, described, his, work, on, capacitive, touchscreens, in, a, short, article, published, in, 1965, and, then, more, fully, with, photographs, and, diagrams, in, an, article, published, in, 1967, mid, 60s, ultrasonic, curtain, another, precursor, of, touchscreens, an, ultrasonic, curtain, based, pointing, device, in, front, of, a, terminal, display, had, been, developed, by, a, team, around, rainer, mallebrein, at, telefunken, konstanz, for, an, air, traffic, control, system, in, 1970, this, evolved, into, a, device, named, touchinput, einrichtung, touch, input, facility, for, the, sig, 50, terminal, utilizing, a, conductively, coated, glass, screen, in, front, of, the, display, this, was, patented, in, 1971, and, the, patent, was, granted, a, couple, of, years, later, the, same, team, had, already, invented, and, marketed, the, rollkugel, mouse, rks, 100, 86, for, the, sig, 100, 86, a, couple, of, years, earlier, 1968, capacitance, the, application, of, touch, technology, for, air, traffic, control, was, described, in, an, article, published, in, 1968, frank, beck, and, bent, stumpe, engineers, from, cern, european, organization, for, nuclear, research, developed, a, transparent, touchscreen, in, the, early, 1970s, based, on, stumpe, s, work, at, a, television, factory, in, the, early, 1960s, then, manufactured, by, cern, and, shortly, after, by, industry, partners, it, was, put, to, use, in, 1973, 1972, optical, a, group, at, the, university, of, illinois, filed, for, a, patent, on, an, optical, touchscreen, that, became, a, standard, part, of, the, magnavox, plato, iv, student, terminal, and, thousands, were, built, for, this, purpose, these, touchscreens, had, a, crossed, array, of, 16, 16, infrared, position, sensors, each, composed, of, an, led, on, one, edge, of, the, screen, and, a, matched, phototransistor, on, the, other, edge, all, mounted, in, front, of, a, monochrome, plasma, display, panel, this, arrangement, could, sense, any, fingertip, sized, opaque, object, in, close, proximity, to, the, screen, 1973, multi, touch, capacitance, in, 1973, beck, and, stumpe, published, another, article, describing, their, capacitive, touchscreen, this, indicated, that, it, was, capable, of, multi, touch, but, this, feature, was, purposely, inhibited, presumably, as, this, was, not, considered, useful, at, the, time, a, variable, called, but, changes, value, from, zero, to, five, when, a, button, is, touched, the, touching, of, other, buttons, would, give, other, non, zero, values, of, but, but, this, is, protected, against, by, software, page, 6, section, 2, 6, actual, contact, between, a, finger, and, the, capacitor, is, prevented, by, a, thin, sheet, of, plastic, page, 3, section, 2, 3, at, that, time, projected, capacitance, had, not, yet, been, invented, 1977, resistive, an, american, company, elographics, in, partnership, with, siemens, began, work, on, developing, a, transparent, implementation, of, an, existing, opaque, touchpad, technology, u, s, patent, no, 3, 911, 215, october, 7, 1975, which, had, been, developed, by, elographics, founder, george, samuel, hurst, the, resulting, resistive, technology, touch, screen, was, first, shown, on, the, world, s, fair, at, knoxville, in, 1982, 1982, multi, touch, camera, multi, touch, technology, began, in, 1982, when, the, university, of, toronto, s, input, research, group, developed, the, first, human, input, multi, touch, system, using, a, frosted, glass, panel, with, a, camera, placed, behind, the, glass, 1983, optical, an, optical, touchscreen, was, used, on, the, hp, 150, starting, in, 1983, the, hp, 150, was, one, of, the, world, s, earliest, commercial, touchscreen, computers, hp, mounted, their, infrared, transmitters, and, receivers, around, the, bezel, of, a, 9, inch, sony, cathode, ray, tube, crt, 1983, multi, touch, force, sensing, touchscreen, bob, boie, of, at, t, bell, labs, used, capacitance, to, track, the, mechanical, changes, in, thickness, of, a, soft, deformable, overlay, membrane, when, one, or, more, physical, objects, interact, with, it, the, flexible, surface, being, easily, replaced, if, damaged, by, these, objects, the, patent, states, the, tactile, sensor, arrangements, may, be, utilized, as, a, touch, screen, many, derivative, sources, retrospectively, describe, boie, as, making, a, major, advancement, with, his, touchscreen, technology, but, no, evidence, has, been, found, that, a, rugged, multi, touch, capacitive, touchscreen, that, could, sense, through, a, rigid, protective, overlay, the, sort, later, required, for, a, mobile, phone, was, ever, developed, or, patented, by, boie, many, of, these, citations, rely, on, anecdotal, evidence, from, bill, buxton, of, bell, labs, however, bill, buxton, did, not, have, much, luck, getting, his, hands, on, this, technology, as, he, states, in, the, citation, our, assumption, false, as, it, turned, out, was, that, the, boie, technology, would, become, available, to, us, in, the, near, future, around, 1990, i, took, a, group, from, xerox, to, see, this, technology, it, since, i, felt, that, it, would, be, appropriate, for, the, user, interface, of, our, large, document, processors, this, did, not, work, out, up, to, 1984, capacitance, although, as, cited, earlier, johnson, is, credited, with, developing, the, first, finger, operated, capacitive, and, resistive, touchscreens, in, 1965, these, worked, by, directly, touching, wires, across, the, front, of, the, screen, stumpe, and, beck, developed, a, self, capacitance, touchscreen, in, 1972, and, a, mutual, capacitance, touchscreen, in, 1977, both, these, devices, could, only, sense, the, finger, by, direct, touch, or, through, a, thin, insulating, film, this, was, 11, microns, thick, according, to, stumpe, s, 1977, report, 1984, first, projected, capacitance, touchscreen, patent, a, capacitance, keypad, and, touchscreen, capable, of, multi, touch, that, could, project, touch, sensing, through, several, centimeters, of, air, and, other, non, conductive, materials, was, invented, by, a, british, inventor, ron, binstead, this, enabled, the, accurate, detection, of, fingers, through, very, thick, glass, and, even, double, glazing, see, keypad, for, image, the, massively, increased, functionality, was, due, to, much, greater, processing, power, being, available, at, that, time, and, the, use, of, a, simple, form, of, artificial, intelligence, see, patent, claim1, an, acorn, bbc, computer, was, initially, used, to, process, the, data, this, technique, later, became, known, as, projected, capacitance, projected, capacitance, uses, a, simple, form, of, artificial, intelligence, to, measure, the, changes, in, capacitance, caused, by, one, or, more, fingers, by, specifically, profiling, the, capacitance, effects, expected, for, finger, touch, and, eliminating, any, measured, capacitance, changes, attributable, to, other, global, and, or, local, events, instead, of, a, keypad, the, device, could, be, used, as, a, continuous, x, y, sensing, area, see, claim, 9, a, transparent, version, was, usable, as, a, projected, capacitance, touchscreen, see, claim, 10, but, it, was, limited, in, size, due, to, the, high, resistance, of, the, narrow, transparent, indium, tin, oxide, tracks, numbered, 96, in, the, image, used, to, link, all, sensing, zones, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, independently, to, a, common, edge, 1984, touchpad, fujitsu, released, a, touch, pad, for, the, micro, 16, to, accommodate, the, complexity, of, kanji, characters, which, were, stored, as, tiled, graphics, 1986, graphic, tablet, a, graphic, touch, tablet, was, released, for, the, sega, ai, computer, early, 80s, evaluation, for, aircraft, touch, sensitive, control, display, units, cdus, were, evaluated, for, commercial, aircraft, flight, decks, in, the, early, 1980s, initial, research, showed, that, a, touch, interface, would, reduce, pilot, workload, as, the, crew, could, then, select, waypoints, functions, and, actions, rather, than, be, head, down, typing, latitudes, longitudes, and, waypoint, codes, on, a, keyboard, an, effective, integration, of, this, technology, was, aimed, at, helping, flight, crews, maintain, a, high, level, of, situational, awareness, of, all, major, aspects, of, the, vehicle, operations, including, the, flight, path, the, functioning, of, various, aircraft, systems, and, moment, to, moment, human, interactions, early, 80s, evaluatation, for, cars, also, in, the, early, 1980s, general, motors, tasked, its, delco, electronics, division, with, a, project, aimed, at, replacing, an, automobile, s, non, essential, functions, i, e, other, than, throttle, transmission, braking, and, steering, from, mechanical, or, electro, mechanical, systems, with, solid, state, alternatives, wherever, possible, the, finished, device, was, dubbed, the, ecc, for, electronic, control, center, a, digital, computer, and, software, control, system, hardwired, to, various, peripheral, sensors, servomechanisms, solenoids, antenna, and, a, monochrome, crt, touchscreen, that, functioned, both, as, display, and, sole, method, of, input, the, ecc, replaced, the, traditional, mechanical, stereo, fan, heater, and, air, conditioner, controls, and, displays, and, was, capable, of, providing, very, detailed, and, specific, information, about, the, vehicle, s, cumulative, and, current, operating, status, in, real, time, the, ecc, was, standard, equipment, on, the, 1985, 1989, buick, riviera, and, later, the, 1988, 1989, buick, reatta, but, was, unpopular, with, consumers, partly, due, to, the, technophobia, of, some, traditional, buick, customers, but, mostly, because, of, costly, technical, problems, suffered, by, the, ecc, s, touchscreen, which, would, render, climate, control, or, stereo, operation, impossible, 1985, graphic, tablet, sega, released, the, terebi, oekaki, also, known, as, the, sega, graphic, board, for, the, sg, 1000, video, game, console, and, sc, 3000, home, computer, it, consisted, of, a, plastic, pen, and, a, plastic, board, with, a, transparent, window, where, pen, presses, are, detected, it, was, used, primarily, with, a, drawing, software, application, 1985, multi, touch, capacitance, the, university, of, toronto, group, including, bill, buxton, developed, a, multi, touch, tablet, that, used, capacitance, rather, than, bulky, camera, based, optical, sensing, systems, see, history, of, multi, touch, 1985, used, for, point, of, sale, the, first, commercially, available, graphical, point, of, sale, pos, software, was, demonstrated, on, the, 16, bit, atari, 520st, color, computer, it, featured, a, color, touchscreen, widget, driven, interface, the, viewtouch, pos, software, was, first, shown, by, its, developer, gene, mosher, at, the, atari, computer,

touchscreen, consisting, of, a, 4, 4, matrix, resulting, in, 16, touch, areas, in, its, small, lcd, graphic, screen, 1988, select, on, lift, off, touchscreens, had, a, bad, reputation, of, being, imprecise, until, 1988, most, user, interface, books, would, state, that, touchscreen, selections, were, limited, to, targets, larger, than, the, average, finger, at, the, time, selections, were, done, in, such, a, way, that, a, target, was, selected, as, soon, as, the, finger, came, over, it, and, the, corresponding, action, was, performed, immediately, errors, were, common, due, to, parallax, or, calibration, problems, leading, to, user, frustration, lift, off, strategy, was, introduced, by, researchers, at, the, university, of, maryland, human, computer, interaction, lab, hcil, as, users, touch, the, screen, feedback, is, provided, as, to, what, will, be, selected, users, can, adjust, the, position, of, the, finger, and, the, action, takes, place, only, when, the, finger, is, lifted, off, the, screen, this, allowed, the, selection, of, small, targets, down, to, a, single, pixel, on, a, 640, 480, video, graphics, array, vga, screen, a, standard, of, that, time, 1988, world, expo, from, april, to, october, 1988, the, city, of, brisbane, australia, hosted, expo, 88, whose, theme, was, leisure, in, the, age, of, technology, to, support, the, event, and, provide,

information, about, the, exposition, s, rides, attractions, performances, facilities, and, the, surrounding, areas, visitors, could, also, select, between, information, displayed, in, english, and, japanese, a, reflection, of, australia, s, overseas, tourist, market, in, the, 1980s, it, is, worth, noting, that, telecom, s, expo, info, system, was, based, on, an, earlier, system, employed, at, expo, 86, in, vancouver, canada, 1990, single, and, multi, touch, gestures, sears, et, al, 1990, gave, a, review, of, academic, research, on, single, and, multi, touch, human, computer, interaction, of, the, time, describing, gestures, such, as, rotating, knobs, adjusting, sliders, and, swiping, the, screen, to, activate, a, switch, or, a, u, shaped, gesture, for, a, toggle, switch, the, hcil, team, developed, and, studied, small, touchscreen, keyboards, including, a, study, that, showed, users, could, type, at, 25, wpm, on, a, touchscreen, keyboard, aiding, their, introduction, on, mobile, devices, they, also, designed, and, implemented, multi, touch, gestures, such, as, selecting, a, range, of, a, line, connecting, objects, and, a, tap, click, gesture, to, select, while, maintaining, location, with, another, finger, 1990, touchscreen, slider, and, toggle, switches, hcil, demonstrated, a, touchscreen, slider, which, was, later, cited, as, prior, art, in, the, lock, screen, patent, litigation, between, apple, and, other, touchscreen, mobile, phone, vendors, in, relation, to, u, s, patent, 7, 657, 849, 1991, the, first, projected, capacitance, patent, is, granted, the, 1984, projected, capacitance, patent, application, is, granted, to, binstead, designs, of, nottingham, england, 1991, inertial, control, from, 1991, to, 1992, the, sun, star7, prototype, pda, implemented, a, touchscreen, with, inertial, scrolling, 1993, capacitance, mouse, keypad, bob, boie, of, at, t, bell, labs, patented, a, simple, mouse, or, keypad, that, capacitively, sensed, just, one, finger, through, a, thin, insulator, although, not, claimed, or, even, mentioned, in, the, patent, this, technology, could, potentially, have, been, used, as, a, capacitance, touchscreen, 1993, first, resistive, touchscreen, phone, ibm, released, the, ibm, simon, which, is, the, first, touchscreen, phone, early, 90s, abandoned, game, controller, an, early, attempt, at, a, handheld, game, console, with, touchscreen, controls, was, sega, s, intended, successor, to, the, game, gear, though, the, device, was, ultimately, shelved, and, never, released, due, to, the, expensive, cost, of, touchscreen, technology, in, the, early, 1990s, 1994, first, x, y, projected, capacitance, touchscreen, patent, an, x, y, multiplexed, projected, capacitance, multiple, input, proximity, detector, and, touchpad, touchscreen, was, invented, by, british, inventor, ron, binstead, this, was, capable, of, multi, touch, and, could, accurately, and, reliably, sense, fingers, through, thick, plastic, and, glass, overlays, together, with, the, inventors, earlier, patent, this, was, very, similar, to, an, apple, patent, taken, out, 10, years, later, in, 2004, 1994, first, wire, based, projected, capacitance, stumpe, and, beck, s, touchscreens, 1972, 1977, already, cited, used, opaque, conductive, copper, tracks, that, obscured, about, 50, of, the, screen, 80, micron, track, 80, micron, space, the, advent, of, projected, capacitance, in, 1984, however, with, its, improved, sensing, capability, indicated, that, most, of, these, tracks, could, be, eliminated, this, proved, to, be, so, and, led, to, the, invention, of, a, wire, based, touchscreen, in, 1994, where, one, 25, micron, diameter, insulation, coated, wire, replaced, about, 30, of, these, 80, micron, wide, tracks, and, could, also, accurately, sense, fingers, through, thick, glass, screen, masking, caused, by, the, copper, was, reduced, from, 50, to, less, than, 0, 5, the, use, of, fine, wire, meant, that, very, large, touchscreens, several, meters, wide, could, be, plotted, onto, a, thin, polyester, support, film, with, a, simple, x, y, pen, plotter, eliminating, the, need, for, expensive, and, complicated, sputter, coating, laser, ablation, screen, printing, or, etching, the, resulting, incredibly, flexible, touchscreen, film, less, than, 100, microns, thick, could, be, attached, by, static, or, non, setting, weak, adhesive, to, one, side, of, a, sheet, of, glass, for, sensing, through, that, glass, early, versions, of, this, device, were, controlled, by, the, pic16c54, microchip, 1994, first, pub, game, with, touchscreen, appearing, in, pubs, in, 1994, jpm, s, monopoly, swp, skill, with, prizes, was, the, first, machine, to, use, touch, screen, technology, instead, of, buttons, see, quiz, machine, history, it, used, a, 14, inch, version, of, this, newly, invented, wire, based, projected, capacitance, touchscreen, and, had, 64, sensing, areas, the, wiring, pattern, being, similar, to, that, shown, in, the, lower, diagram, the, zig, zag, pattern, was, introduced, to, minimize, visual, reflections, and, prevent, moire, interference, between, the, wires, and, the, monitor, line, scans, about, 600, of, these, were, sold, for, this, purpose, retailing, at, 50, apiece, which, was, very, cheap, for, the, time, working, through, very, thick, glass, made, it, ideal, for, operation, in, a, hostile, environment, such, as, a, pub, although, reflected, light, from, the, copper, wires, was, noticeable, under, certain, lighting, conditions, this, problem, was, eliminated, by, using, tinted, glass, the, reflection, issue, was, later, resolved, by, using, finer, 10, micron, diameter, dark, coated, wires, throughout, the, following, decade, jpm, continued, to, use, touchscreens, for, many, other, games, such, as, cluedo, and, who, wants, to, be, a, millionaire, 1998, projected, capacitance, licenses, this, technology, was, licensed, four, years, later, to, romag, glass, products, later, to, become, zytronic, displays, and, visual, planet, in, 2003, see, page, 4, 2004, mobile, multi, touch, projected, capacitance, patent, apple, patents, its, multi, touch, capacitive, touchscreen, for, mobile, devices, 2004, video, games, with, touchscreens, touchscreens, were, not, be, popularly, used, for, video, games, until, the, release, of, the, nintendo, ds, in, 2004, 2007, mobile, phone, with, capacitance, the, first, mobile, phone, with, a, capacitive, touchscreen, was, lg, prada, released, in, may, 2007, which, was, before, the, first, iphone, released, by, 2009, touchscreen, enabled, mobile, phones, were, becoming, trendy, and, quickly, gaining, popularity, in, both, basic, and, advanced, devices, in, quarter, 4, 2009, for, the, first, time, a, majority, of, smartphones, i, e, not, all, mobile, phones, shipped, with, touchscreens, over, non, touch, 2013, resistive, versus, projected, capacitance, sales, in, 2007, 93, of, touchscreens, shipped, were, resistive, and, only, 4, were, projected, capacitance, in, 2013, 3, of, touchscreens, shipped, were, resistive, and, 96, were, projected, capacitance, see, page, 5, 2015, force, sensing, touchscreens, until, recently, most, consumer, touchscreens, could, only, sense, one, point, of, contact, at, a, time, and, few, have, had, the, capability, to, sense, how, hard, one, is, touching, this, has, changed, with, the, commercialization, of, multi, touch, technology, and, the, apple, watch, being, released, with, a, force, sensitive, display, in, april, 2015, 2015, first, diagonally, wired, touchscreen, patent, a, new, diagonal, wiring, arrangement, was, invented, by, british, inventor, ron, binstead, for, use, with, resistive, and, multi, touch, projected, capacitance, touchscreens, all, the, i, o, elements, coming, from, just, one, edge, and, no, bussed, wires, or, dead, zone, round, the, other, three, edges, see, top, image, on, right, touch, resolution, is, almost, doubled, compared, to, x, y, multiplexing, for, example, 16, x, y, i, os, create, a, maximum, of, 64, sensing, element, intersections, whereas, 16, diagonal, i, os, create, 120, intersections, 2015, bistate, projected, capacitance, when, used, as, a, projected, capacitance, touchscreen, in, mutual, capacitance, mode, diagonal, wiring, requires, each, i, o, line, to, be, capable, of, switching, between, two, states, bistate, an, output, some, of, the, time, and, an, input, at, other, times, i, os, are, inputs, most, of, the, time, but, once, every, scan, one, of, the, i, os, has, to, take, its, turn, at, being, an, output, the, remaining, input, i, os, sensing, any, signals, it, generates, the, i, o, lines, therefore, may, have, to, change, from, input, to, output, and, vice, versa, many, times, a, second, this, new, design, won, an, electronics, weekly, elektra, award, in, 2017, 2021, first, infinitely, wide, touchscreen, patent, with, standard, x, y, array, touchscreens, the, length, of, the, horizontal, sensing, elements, increases, as, the, width, of, the, touchscreen, increases, eventually, a, limit, is, hit, where, the, resistance, gets, so, great, that, the, touchscreen, can, no, longer, function, properly, the, patent, describes, how, the, use, of, diagonal, elements, ensures, that, the, length, of, any, element, never, exceeds, 1, 414, times, the, height, h, 2, textstyle, left, lceil, h, sqrt, 2, right, rfloor, of, the, touchscreen, no, matter, how, wide, it, is, this, could, be, reduced, to, 1, 15, times, the, height, if, opposing, diagonal, elements, intersect, at, 60, degrees, instead, of, 90, degrees, the, elongated, touchscreen, could, be, controlled, by, a, single, processor, or, the, distant, ends, could, be, controlled, totally, independently, by, different, processors, linked, by, a, synchronizing, processor, in, the, overlapping, middle, section, the, number, of, unique, intersections, could, be, increased, by, allowing, individual, sensing, elements, to, run, in, two, opposing, directions, as, shown, in, the, diagram, there, are, a, number, of, touchscreen, technologies, with, different, methods, of, sensing, touch, a, resistive, touchscreen, panel, is, composed, of, several, thin, layers, the, most, important, of, which, are, two, transparent, electrically, resistive, layers, facing, each, other, with, a, thin, gap, between, them, the, top, layer, the, layer, that, is, touched, has, a, coating, on, the, underside, surface, just, beneath, it, is, a, similar, resistive, layer, on, top, of, its, substrate, one, layer, has, conductive, connections, along, its, sides, while, the, other, along, the, top, and, bottom, a, voltage, is, applied, to, one, layer, and, sensed, by, the, other, when, an, object, such, as, a, fingertip, or, stylus, tip, presses, down, onto, the, outer, surface, the, two, layers, touch, to, become, connected, at, that, point, the, panel, then, behaves, as, a, pair, of, voltage, dividers, one, axis, at, a, time, by, rapidly, switching, between, each, layer, the, position, of, pressure, on, the, screen, can, be, detected, resistive, touch, is, used, in, restaurants, factories, and, hospitals, due, to, its, high, tolerance, for, liquids, and, contaminants, a, major, benefit, of, resistive, touch, technology, is, its, low, cost, additionally, they, may, be, used, with, gloves, on, or, by, using, anything, rigid, as, a, finger, substitute, as, only, sufficient, pressure, is, necessary, for, the, touch, to, be, sensed, disadvantages, include, the, need, to, press, down, and, a, risk, of, damage, by, sharp, objects, resistive, touchscreens, also, suffer, from, poorer, contrast, due, to, having, additional, reflections, i, e, glare, from, the, layers, of, material, placed, over, the, screen, this, type, of, touchscreen, has, been, used, by, nintendo, in, the, ds, family, the, 3ds, family, and, the, wii, u, gamepad, due, to, their, simple, structure, with, very, few, inputs, resistive, touchscreens, are, mainly, used, for, single, touch, operation, although, some, two, touch, versions, often, described, as, multi, touch, are, available, however, there, are, some, true, multi, touch, resistive, touchscreens, available, these, need, many, more, inputs, and, rely, on, x, y, multiplexing, to, keep, the, i, o, count, down, one, example, of, a, true, multi, touch, resistive, touchscreen, can, detect, 10, fingers, at, the, same, time, this, has, 80, i, o, connections, these, are, possibly, split, 34, x, inputs, 46, y, outputs, forming, a, standard, 3, 4, aspect, ratio, touchscreen, with, 1564, x, y, intersecting, touch, sensing, nodes, tri, state, multiplexing, could, have, been, used, instead, of, x, y, multiplexing, this, would, have, reduced, the, i, o, count, from, 80, to, 60, while, creating, 1770, unique, touch, sensing, nodes, with, no, need, for, a, bezel, and, with, all, inputs, coming, from, just, one, edge, surface, acoustic, wave, saw, technology, uses, ultrasonic, waves, that, pass, over, the, touchscreen, panel, when, the, panel, is, touched, a, portion, of, the, wave, is, absorbed, the, change, in, ultrasonic, waves, is, processed, by, the, controller, to, determine, the, position, of, the, touch, event, surface, acoustic, wave, touchscreen, panels, can, be, damaged, by, outside, elements, contaminants, on, the, surface, can, also, interfere, with, the, functionality, of, the, touchscreen, saw, devices, have, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, delay, lines, filters, correlators, and, dc, to, dc, converters, a, capacitive, touchscreen, panel, consists, of, an, insulator, such, as, glass, coated, with, a, transparent, conductor, such, as, indium, tin, oxide, ito, as, the, human, body, is, also, an, electrical, conductor, touching, the, surface, of, the, screen, results, in, a, distortion, of, the, screen, s, electrostatic, field, measurable, as, a, change, in, capacitance, different, technologies, may, be, used, to, determine, the, location, of, the, touch, the, location, is, then, sent, to, the, controller, for, processing, some, touchscreens, use, silver, instead, of, ito, as, ito, causes, several, environmental, problems, due, to, the, use, of, indium, the, controller, is, typically, a, complementary, metal, oxide, semiconductor, cmos, application, specific, integrated, circuit, asic, chip, which, in, turn, usually, sends, the, signals, to, a, cmos, digital, signal, processor, dsp, for, processing, unlike, a, resistive, touchscreen, some, capacitive, touchscreens, cannot, be, used, to, detect, a, finger, through, electrically, insulating, material, such, as, gloves, this, disadvantage, especially, affects, usability, in, consumer, electronics, such, as, touch, tablet, pcs, and, capacitive, smartphones, in, cold, weather, when, people, may, be, wearing, gloves, it, can, be, overcome, with, a, special, capacitive, stylus, or, a, special, application, glove, with, an, embroidered, patch, of, conductive, thread, allowing, electrical, contact, with, the, user, s, fingertip, a, low, quality, switching, mode, power, supply, unit, with, an, accordingly, unstable, noisy, voltage, may, temporarily, interfere, with, the, precision, accuracy, and, sensitivity, of, capacitive, touch, screens, some, capacitive, display, manufacturers, continue, to, develop, thinner, and, more, accurate, touchscreens, those, for, mobile, devices, are, now, being, produced, with, in, cell, technology, such, as, in, samsung, s, super, amoled, screens, that, eliminates, a, layer, by, building, the, capacitors, inside, the, display, itself, this, type, of, touchscreen, reduces, the, visible, distance, between, the, user, s, finger, and, what, the, user, is, touching, on, the, screen, reducing, the, thickness, and, weight, of, the, display, which, is, desirable, in, smartphones, a, simple, parallel, plate, capacitor, has, two, conductors, separated, by, a, dielectric, layer, most, of, the, energy, in, this, system, is, concentrated, directly, between, the, plates, some, of, the, energy, spills, over, into, the, area, outside, the, plates, and, the, electric, field, lines, associated, with, this, effect, are, called, fringing, fields, part, of, the, challenge, of, making, a, practical, capacitive, sensor, is, to, design, a, set, of, printed, circuit, traces, which, direct, fringing, fields, into, an, active, sensing, area, accessible, to, a, user, a, parallel, plate, capacitor, is, not, a, good, choice, for, such, a, sensor, pattern, placing, a, finger, near, fringing, electric, fields, adds, conductive, surface, area, to, the, capacitive, system, the, additional, charge, storage, capacity, added, by, the, finger, is, known, as, finger, capacitance, or, cf, the, capacitance, of, the, sensor, without, a, finger, present, is, known, as, parasitic, capacitance, or, cp, in, this, basic, technology, only, one, side, of, the, insulator, is, coated, with, a, conductive, layer, a, small, voltage, is, applied, to, the, layer, resulting, in, a, uniform, electrostatic, field, when, a, conductor, such, as, a, human, finger, touches, the, uncoated, surface, a, capacitor, is, dynamically, formed, the, sensor, s, controller, can, determine, the, location, of, the, touch, indirectly, from, the, change, in, the, capacitance, as, measured, from, the, four, corners, of, the, panel, as, it, has, no, moving, parts, it, is, moderately, durable, but, has, limited, resolution, is, prone, to, false, signals, from, parasitic, capacitive, coupling, and, needs, calibration, during, manufacture, it, is, therefore, most, often, used, in, simple, applications, such, as, industrial, controls, and, kiosks, although, some, standard, capacitance, detection, methods, are, projective, in, the, sense, that, they, can, be, used, to, detect, a, finger, through, a, non, conductive, surface, they, are, very, sensitive, to, fluctuations, in, temperature, which, expand, or, contract, the, sensing, plates, causing, fluctuations, in, the, capacitance, of, these, plates, these, fluctuations, result, in, a, lot, of, background, noise, so, a, strong, finger, signal, is, required, for, accurate, detection, this, limits, applications, to, those, where, the, finger, directly, touches, the, sensing, element, or, is, sensed, through, a, relatively, thin, non, conductive, surface, projected, capacitive, touch, pct, also, pcap, technology, is, a, variant, of, capacitive, touch, technology, but, where, sensitivity, to, touch, accuracy, resolution, and, speed, of, touch, have, been, greatly, improved, by, the, use, of, a, simple, form, of, artificial, intelligence, this, intelligent, processing, enables, finger, sensing, to, be, projected, accurately, and, reliably, through, very, thick, glass, and, even, double, glazing, projected, capacitance, is, a, method, for, accurately, detecting, and, tracking, a, particular, variable, or, group, of, variables, such, as, finger, s, by, a, using, a, simple, form, of, artificial, intelligence, to, develop, a, profile, of, the, capacitance, changing, effects, expected, for, that, variable, b, specifically, looking, for, such, changes, and, c, eliminating, measured, capacitance, changes, that, do, not, match, this, profile, attributable, to, global, variables, such, as, temperature, humidity, dirt, build, up, electrical, noise, and, local, variables, such, as, rain, drops, partial, shade, and, hands, elbows, capacitance, sensors, may, be, discrete, possibly, but, not, necessarily, in, a, regular, array, or, they, may, be, multiplexed, assumptions, in, practice, various, assumptions, are, made, such, as, a, fingers, will, not, be, touching, the, screen, at, power, up, b, a, finger, will, not, be, on, the, same, spot, for, more, than, a, fixed, period, of, time, and, c, fingers, will, not, be, touching, everywhere, at, the, same, time, a, if, a, finger, is, touching, the, screen, at, power, up, then, as, soon, as, it, is, removed, a, large, anti, touch, capacitance, change, will, be, detected, this, signals, to, the, processor, to, reset, the, touch, thresholds, and, store, new, no, touch, values, for, each, input, b, long, term, drift, compensation, is, used, to, gradually, raise, or, lower, these, thresholds, trending, eventually, to, no, touch, this, compensates, for, global, changes, in, temperature, and, humidity, it, also, eliminates, the, possibility, of, any, position, appearing, to, be, touched, for, too, long, due, to, some, non, finger, event, this, might, be, caused, for, example, by, a, wet, leaf, landing, on, and, sticking, to, the, screen, c, when, a, decision, is, to, be, made, about, the, validity, of, one, or, more, touches, then, assumption, c, means, that, the, average, value, of, changes, measured, for, some, of, the, inputs, with, the, smallest, change, can, be, used, to, offset, the, touch, thresholds, of, the, inputs, in, contention, this, minimizes, the, influence, of, hands, and, arms, by, these, and, other, means, the, processor, is, constantly, fine, tuning, the, touch, thresholds, and, tweaking, the, touch, sensitivity, of, each, input, this, enables, very, small, changes, caused, only, by, fingers, to, be, accurately, detected, through, thick, overlays, or, several, centimeters, of, air, when, a, conductive, object, such, as, a, finger, comes, into, contact, with, a, pct, panel, it, distorts, the, local, electrostatic, field, at, that, point, this, is, measurable, as, a, change, in, capacitance, if, a, finger, bridges, the, gap, between, two, of, the, tracks, the, charge, field, is, further, interrupted, and, detected, by, the, controller, the, capacitance, can, be, changed, and, measured, at, every, individual, point, on, the, grid, this, system, is, able, to, accurately, track, touches, due, to, the, top, layer, of, a, pct, being, glass, it, is, sturdier, than, less, expensive, resistive, touch, technology, unlike, traditional, capacitive, touch, technology, it, is, possible, for, a, pct, system, to, sense, a, passive, stylus, or, gloved, fingers, moisture, on, the, surface, of, the, panel, high, humidity, or, collected, dust, are, not, a, problem, especially, with, fine, wire, based, touchscreens, due, to, the, fact, that, wire, based, touchscreens, have, a, very, low, parasitic, capacitance, and, there, is, a, greater, distance, between, neighboring, conductors, projected, capacitance, has, long, term, drift, compensation, built, in, this, minimizes, the, effects, of, slowly, changing, environmental, factors, such, as, the, build, up, of, dirt, and, effects, caused, by, changes, in, the, weather, drops, of, rain, have, little, effect, but, flowing, water, and, especially, flowing, sea, water, due, to, its, electrical, conductivity, can, cause, short, term, issues, a, high, frequency, rf, signal, possibly, from, 100, khz, to, 1, mhz, is, imposed, on, one, track, at, a, time, and, appropriate, capacitance, measurements, are, taken, as, described, later, in, this, article, this, process, is, repeated, until, all, the, tracks, have, been, sampled, conductive, tracks, are, often, transparent, one, example, being, indium, tin, oxide, ito, a, transparent, electrical, conductor, but, these, conductive, tracks, can, be, made, of, very, fine, non, transparent, metal, mesh, or, individual, fine, wires, layout, can, vary, depending, on, whether, a, single, finger, is, to, be, detected, or, multiple, fingers, in, order, to, detect, many, fingers, at, the, same, time, some, modern, pct, touch, screens, are, composed, of, thousands, of, discrete, keys, each, key, being, linked, individually, to, the, edge, of, the, touch, screen, this, is, enabled, by, etching, an, electrode, grid, pattern, in, a, transparent, conductive, coating, on, one, side, of, a, sheet, of, glass, or, plastic, to, reduce, the, number, of, input, tracks, most, pct, touch, screens, use, multiplexing, this, enables, for, example, 100, n, discrete, key, inputs, to, be, reduced, to, 20, 2, n, textstyle, left, lceil, 2, sqrt, n, right, rfloor, when, using, x, y, multiplexing, or, 15, 1, 5, n, textstyle, left, lceil, 1, 5, sqrt, n, right, rfloor, if, using, bistate, multiplexing, or, tri, state, multiplexing, capacitance, multiplexing, requires, a, grid, of, intersecting, but, electrically, isolated, conductive, tracks, this, can, be, achieved, in, many, different, ways, one, way, is, by, creating, parallel, conductive, tracks, on, one, side, of, a, plastic, film, and, similar, parallel, tracks, on, the, other, side, orientated, at, 90, degrees, to, the, first, side, another, way, is, to, etch, tracks, on, separate, sheets, of, glass, and, join, these, sheets, with, tracks, at, right, angles, to, each, other, face, to, face, using, a, thin, non, conductive, adhesive, interlayer, a, simple, alternative, is, to, embed, an, x, y, or, diagonal, grid, of, very, fine, insulation, coated, conductive, wires, in, a, thin, polyester, film, this, film, can, then, be, attached, to, one, side, of, a, sheet, of, glass, for, operation, through, the, glass, touch, resolution, and, the, number, of, fingers, that, can, be, detected, simultaneously, is, determined, by, the, number, of, cross, over, points, x, y, if, x, y, n, then, the, maximum, possible, number, of, cross, overs, is, n, 2, 2, however, the, number, of, cross, over, points, can, be, almost, doubled, by, using, a, diagonal, lattice, layout, see, lattice, diagonal, touchscreen, diagrams, where, instead, of, x, elements, only, ever, crossing, y, elements, each, conductive, element, crosses, every, other, element, under, these, circumstances, the, maximum, number, of, cross, overs, is, n, 2, n, 2, all, the, connector, inputs, come, from, just, one, edge, see, video, above, of, raw, data, from, 32, input, diagonally, wired, touchscreen, in, 2015, a, new, diagonal, array, suited, to, a, range, of, touchscreen, and, keypad, technologies, was, invented, and, patented, by, ron, binstead, of, binstead, designs, ltd, the, diagram, left, shows, how, a, group, of, 6, parallel, conductive, elements, folded, back, on, themselves, at, right, angles, can, create, a, triangular, array, of, 15, unique, intersections, an, x, y, array, with, 6, conductive, elements, would, only, have, created, a, maximum, of, 9, unique, intersections, although, conductive, elements, are, normally, connected, to, a, terminal, at, one, end, of, the, conductor, the, left, diagram, shows, that, these, folded, elements, can, be, terminated, at, the, fold, thereby, forming, split, or, bifurcated, elements, a, square, rectangular, diagonal, array, can, be, formed, by, double, folding, the, parallel, conductors, see, diagram, on, the, right, two, connectors, could, be, fitted, at, the, folds, on, opposite, sides, of, the, array, alternatively, a, single, connector, can, be, fitted, at, one, end, of, the, array, as, shown, in, the, diagram, cylindrical, touchscreens, diagonal, sensing, elements, can, also, be, formed, into, a, seamless, cylindrical, array, the, diagram, on, the, right, shows, a, split, 9, i, o, bi, state, cylindrical, layout, with, 36, unique, intersections, all, the, i, o, lines, connected, to, one, end, of, the, cylinder, a, standard, x, y, array, would, require, horizontal, i, o, lines, entering, the, side, of, the, cylinder, unsplit, diagonal, sensing, elements, can, also, be, formed, into, cylinders, but, 9, i, os, would, only, create, 20, 5x4, unique, intersections, these, cylinders, can, be, physically, transformed, into, complex, 3, dimensional, shapes, by, a, range, of, different, methods, such, as, blow, molding, vacuum, forming, etc, a, similar, layout, is, possible, for, a, complementary, cylindrical, led, display, see, charlieplexing, diagonal, arrays, infinitely, wide, touchscreens, touchscreen, width, is, normally, restricted, by, the, resistance, of, the, conductive, material, used, as, the, width, of, an, x, y, touchscreen, is, increased, eventually, the, resistance, of, the, horizontal, conductors, becomes, too, great, for, the, touchscreen, to, work, properly, infinitely, wide, touchscreens, are, possible, however, when, using, diagonal, wiring, because, track, lengths, are, always, 1, 414, x, the, height, of, the, touchscreen, h, 2, textstyle, left, lceil, h, sqrt, 2, right, rfloor, and, are, independent, of, touchscreen, width, see, diagram, on, right, there, are, two, types, of, pct, mutual, capacitance, and, self, capacitance, an, electrical, signal, imposed, on, one, electrical, conductor, can, be, capacitively, sensed, by, another, electrical, conductor, that, is, in, very, close, proximity, but, electrically, isolated, a, feature, that, is, exploited, in, mutual, capacitance, touchscreens, in, a, mutual, capacitive, sensor, array, the, mutual, crossing, of, one, electrical, conductor, with, another, electrical, conductor, but, with, no, direct, electrical, contact, forms, a, capacitor, see, touchscreen, construction, high, frequency, voltage, pulses, are, applied, to, these, conductors, one, at, a, time, these, pulses, capacitively, couple, to, every, conductor, that, intersects, it, bringing, a, finger, or, conductive, stylus, close, to, the, surface, of, the, sensor, changes, the, local, electrostatic, field, which, in, turn, reduces, the, capacitance, between, these, intersecting, conductors, any, significant, change, in, the, strength, of, the, signal, sensed, is, used, to, determine, if, a, finger, is, present, or, not, at, an, intersection, the, capacitance, change, at, every, intersection, on, the, grid, can, be, measured, to, accurately, determine, one, or, more, touch, locations, mutual, capacitance, allows, multi, touch, operation, where, multiple, fingers, palms, or, styli, can, be, accurately, tracked, at, the, same, time, the, greater, the, number, of, intersections, the, better, the, touch, resolution, and, the, more, independent, fingers, that, can, be, detected, this, indicates, a, distinct, advantage, of, diagonal, wiring, over, standard, x, y, wiring, since, diagonal, wiring, creates, nearly, twice, the, number, of, intersections, a, 30, i, o, 16, 14, x, y, array, for, example, would, have, 224, of, these, intersections, capacitors, and, a, 30, i, o, diagonal, lattice, array, could, have, 435, intersections, each, trace, of, an, x, y, mutual, capacitance, array, only, has, one, function, it, is, either, an, input, or, an, output, the, horizontal, traces, may, be, transmitters, while, the, vertical, traces, are, sensors, or, vice, versa, the, traces, in, a, diagonal, mutual, capacitance, array, however, have, to, continuously, change, their, functionality, on, the, fly, by, a, process, called, bi, state, multiplexing, or, tri, state, multiplexing, some, of, the, time, a, trace, will, be, an, output, at, another, time, it, will, be, an, input, or, grounded, a, look, up, table, can, be, used, to, simplify, this, process, by, slightly, distorting, the, conductors, in, a, n, i, o, diagonal, matrix, the, equivalent, of, a, n, 1, by, n, 2, array, is, formed, after, address, decoding, this, can, then, be, processed, as, a, standard, x, y, array, self, capacitance, sensors, can, have, the, same, x, y, or, diagonal, grid, layout, as, mutual, capacitance, sensors, but, with, self, capacitance, all, the, traces, usually, operate, independently, with, no, interaction, between, different, traces, along, with, several, other, methods, the, extra, capacitive, load, of, a, finger, on, a, trace, electrode, may, be, measured, by, a, current, meter, or, by, the, change, in, frequency, of, an, rc, oscillator, traces, are, sensed, one, after, the, other, until, all, the, traces, have, been, sensed, a, finger, may, be, detected, anywhere, along, the, whole, length, of, a, trace, even, off, screen, but, there, is, no, indication, where, the, finger, is, along, that, trace, if, however, a, finger, is, also, detected, along, another, intersecting, trace, then, it, is, assumed, that, the, finger, position, is, at, the, intersection, of, the, two, traces, this, allows, for, the, speedy, and, accurate, detection, of, a, single, finger, there, is, however, ambiguity, if, more, than, one, finger, is, to, be, detected, two, fingers, may, have, four, possible, detection, positions, only, two, of, which, are, true, the, other, two, being, ghosts, however, by, selectively, de, sensitizing, any, touch, points, in, contention, conflicting, results, are, easily, resolved, this, enables, self, capacitance, to, be, used, for, two, touch, operation, although, mutual, capacitance, is, simpler, for, multi, touch, multi, touch, can, be, achieved, using, self, capacitance, if, the, trace, being, sensed, is, intersected, by, another, trace, that, has, a, desensitizing, signal, on, it, then, that, intersection, is, insensitive, to, touch, by, imposing, such, a, desensitizing, signal, on, all, the, intersecting, traces, except, one, along, the, trace, being, sensed, then, just, a, short, length, of, that, trace, will, be, sensitive, to, touch, by, selecting, a, sequence, of, these, sensing, sections, along, the, trace, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, accurate, position, of, multiple, fingers, along, the, one, trace, this, process, can, then, be, repeated, for, all, the, other, traces, until, the, whole, screen, has, been, scanned, self, capacitive, touch, screen, layers, are, used, on, mobile, phones, such, as, the, sony, xperia, sola, the, samsung, galaxy, s4, galaxy, note, 3, galaxy, s5, and, galaxy, alpha, self, capacitance, is, far, more, sensitive, than, mutual, capacitance, and, is, mainly, used, for, single, touch, simple, gesturing, and, proximity, sensing, where, the, finger, does, not, even, have, to, touch, the, glass, surface, mutual, capacitance, is, mainly, used, for, multitouch, applications, many, touchscreen, manufacturers, use, both, self, and, mutual, capacitance, technologies, in, the, same, product, thereby, combining, their, individual, benefits, when, using, a, 16, x, 14, x, y, array, to, determine, the, position, of, a, single, finger, by, self, capacitance, 30, i, e, 16, 14, capacitance, measurements, are, required, the, finger, being, determined, to, be, at, the, intersection, of, the, strongest, of, the, 16, x, measurements, and, the, strongest, of, the, 14, y, measurements, however, when, using, mutual, capacitance, every, intersection, may, have, to, be, measured, making, a, total, of, 224, i, e, 16, x, 14, capacitance, measurements, in, this, example, therefore, mutual, capacitance, requires, nearly, 7, times, as, many, measurements, as, self, capacitance, to, detect, the, position, of, a, finger, many, applications, such, as, selecting, items, from, a, list, or, menu, require, just, one, finger, and, self, capacitance, is, eminently, suitable, for, such, applications, due, to, the, relatively, low, processing, load, simpler, processing, method, the, ability, to, sense, through, thick, dielectric, materials, or, air, and, the, possibility, of, reducing, the, number, of, inputs, required, through, repeat, track, layouts, for, many, other, applications, however, such, as, for, expanding, contracting, items, on, the, screen, and, for, other, gestures, two, or, more, fingers, need, to, be, tracked, two, fingers, can, be, detected, and, tracked, accurately, using, self, capacitance, but, this, does, involve, a, few, extra, calculations, and, 4, extra, capacitance, measurements, to, eliminate, the, 2, ghost, positions, one, method, is, to, undertake, a, full, self, capacitance, scan, to, detect, the, 4, ambiguous, finger, positions, then, use, just, 4, targeted, mutual, capacitance, measurements, to, discover, which, two, of, the, 4, positions, are, valid, and, which, 2, are, not, this, gives, a, total, of, 34, measurements, still, far, less, than, the, 224, required, when, using, mutual, capacitance, alone, with, 3, fingers, 9, disambiguations, are, required, with, 4, fingers, 16, disambiguations, etc, with, more, fingers, it, may, be, decided, that, the, process, of, disambiguation, is, too, unwieldy, if, sufficient, processing, power, is, available, the, switch, can, then, be, made, to, full, mutual, capacitance, scanning, capacitive, touchscreens, do, not, necessarily, need, to, be, operated, by, a, finger, but, until, recently, the, special, styli, required, could, be, quite, expensive, to, purchase, the, cost, of, this, technology, has, fallen, greatly, in, recent, years, and, capacitive, styli, are, now, widely, available, for, a, nominal, charge, and, often, given, away, free, with, mobile, accessories, these, consist, of, an, electrically, conductive, shaft, with, a, soft, conductive, rubber, tip, thereby, resistively, connecting, the, fingers, to, the, tip, of, the, stylus, an, infrared, touchscreen, uses, an, array, of, x, y, infrared, led, and, photodetector, pairs, around, the, edges, of, the, screen, to, detect, a, disruption, in, the, pattern, of, led, beams, these, led, beams, cross, each, other, in, vertical, and, horizontal, patterns, this, helps, the, sensors, pick, up, the, exact, location, of, the, touch, a, major, benefit, of, such, a, system, is, that, it, can, detect, essentially, any, opaque, object, including, a, finger, gloved, finger, stylus, or, pen, it, is, generally, used, in, outdoor, applications, and, pos, systems, that, cannot, rely, on, a, conductor, such, as, a, bare, finger, to, activate, the, touchscreen, unlike, capacitive, touchscreens, infrared, touchscreens, do, not, require, any, patterning, on, the, glass, which, increases, durability, and, optical, clarity, of, the, overall, system, infrared, touchscreens, are, sensitive, to, dirt, and, dust, that, can, interfere, with, the, infrared, beams, and, suffer, from, parallax, in, curved, surfaces, and, accidental, press, when, the, user, hovers, a, finger, over, the, screen, while, searching, for, the, item, to, be, selected, a, translucent, acrylic, sheet, is, used, as, a, rear, projection, screen, to, display, information, the, edges, of, the, acrylic, sheet, are, illuminated, by, infrared, leds, and, infrared, cameras, are, focused, on, the, back, of, the, sheet, objects, placed, on, the, sheet, are, detectable, by, the, cameras, when, the, sheet, is, touched, by, the, user, frustrated, total, internal, reflection, results, in, leakage, of, infrared, light, which, peaks, at, the, points, of, maximum, pressure, indicating, the, user, s, touch, location, microsoft, s, pixelsense, tablets, use, this, technology, optical, touchscreens, are, a, relatively, modern, development, in, touchscreen, technology, in, which, two, or, more, image, sensors, such, as, cmos, sensors, are, placed, around, the, edges, mostly, the, corners, of, the, screen, infrared, backlights, are, placed, in, the, sensor, s, field, of, view, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, screen, a, touch, blocks, some, lights, from, the, sensors, and, the, location, and, size, of, the, touching, object, can, be, calculated, see, visual, hull, this, technology, is, growing, in, popularity, due, to, its, scalability, versatility, and, affordability, for, larger, touchscreens, introduced, in, 2002, by, 3m, this, system, detects, a, touch, by, using, sensors, to, measure, the, piezoelectricity, in, the, glass, complex, algorithms, interpret, this, information, and, provide, the, actual, location, of, the, touch, the, technology, is, unaffected, by, dust, and, other, outside, elements, including, scratches, since, there, is, no, need, for, additional, elements, on, screen, it, also, claims, to, provide, excellent, optical, clarity, any, object, can, be, used, to, generate, touch, events, including, gloved, fingers, a, downside, is, that, after, the, initial, touch, the, system, cannot, detect, a, motionless, finger, however, for, the, same, reason, resting, objects, do, not, disrupt, touch, recognition, the, key, to, this, technology, is, that, a, touch, at, any, one, position, on, the, surface, generates, a, sound, wave, in, the, substrate, which, then, produces, a, unique, combined, signal, as, measured, by, three, or, more, tiny, transducers, attached, to, the, edges, of, the, touchscreen, the, digitized, signal, is, compared, to, a, list, corresponding, to, every, position, on, the, surface, determining, the, touch, location, a, moving, touch, is, tracked, by, rapid, repetition, of, this, process, extraneous, and, ambient, sounds, are, ignored, since, they, do, not, match, any, stored, sound, profile, the, technology, differs, from, other, sound, based, technologies, by, using, a, simple, look, up, method, rather, than, expensive, signal, processing, hardware, as, with, the, dispersive, signal, technology, system, a, motionless, finger, cannot, be, detected, after, the, initial, touch, however, for, the, same, reason, the, touch, recognition, is, not, disrupted, by, any, resting, objects, the, technology, was, created, by, soundtouch, ltd, in, the, early, 2000s, as, described, by, the, patent, family, ep1852772, and, introduced, to, the, market, by, tyco, international, s, elo, division, in, 2006, as, acoustic, pulse, recognition, the, touchscreen, used, by, elo, is, made, of, ordinary, glass, giving, good, durability, and, optical, clarity, the, technology, usually, retains, accuracy, with, scratches, and, dust, on, the, screen, the, technology, is, also, well, suited, to, displays, that, are, physically, larger, there, are, several, principal, ways, to, build, a, touchscreen, the, key, goals, are, to, recognize, one, or, more, fingers, touching, a, display, to, interpret, the, command, that, this, represents, and, to, communicate, the, command, to, the, appropriate, application, multi, touch, projected, capacitance, screens, a, very, simple, low, cost, way, to, make, a, multi, touch, projected, capacitance, touchscreen, is, to, sandwich, an, x, y, or, diagonal, matrix, of, fine, insulation, coated, copper, or, tungsten, wires, between, two, layers, of, clear, polyester, film, this, creates, an, array, of, proximity, sensing, micro, capacitors, one, of, these, micro, capacitors, every, 10, to, 15, mm, is, probably, sufficient, spacing, if, fingers, are, relatively, widely, spaced, apart, but, very, high, discrimination, multi, touch, may, need, a, micro, capacitor, every, 5, or, 6, mm, a, similar, system, can, be, used, for, ultra, high, resolution, sensing, such, as, fingerprint, sensing, fingerprint, sensors, require, a, micro, capacitor, spacing, of, about, 44, to, 50, microns, the, touchscreens, can, be, manufactured, at, home, using, readily, available, tools, and, materials, or, it, can, be, done, industrially, first, a, continuous, trace, wiring, pattern, is, generated, using, a, simple, cad, system, the, wire, is, threaded, through, a, plotter, pen, and, plotted, directly, as, one, continuous, wire, onto, a, thin, sheet, of, adhesive, coated, clear, polyester, film, such, as, window, film, using, a, standard, low, cost, x, y, pen, plotter, after, plotting, the, single, wire, is, gently, cut, into, individual, sections, with, a, sharp, scalpel, taking, care, not, to, damage, the, film, a, second, identical, polyester, film, is, laminated, over, the, first, film, the, resulting, touchscreen, film, is, then, trimmed, to, shape, and, a, connector, is, retro, fitted, the, end, product, is, extremely, flexible, being, about, 75, microns, thick, about, the, thickness, of, a, human, hair, it, can, even, be, creased, without, loss, of, functionality, the, film, can, be, mounted, on, or, behind, non, conducting, or, slightly, conducting, surfaces, usually, it, is, mounted, behind, a, sheet, of, glass, up, to, 12, mm, thick, or, more, for, sensing, through, the, glass, this, method, is, suitable, for, a, wide, range, of, touchscreen, sizes, from, very, small, to, several, meters, wide, or, even, wider, if, using, a, diagonally, wired, matrix, the, end, product, is, environmentally, friendly, as, it, uses, recyclable, polyester, and, minute, quantities, of, copper, wire, the, film, could, even, have, a, second, life, as, another, product, such, as, drawing, film, or, wrapping, film, unlike, some, other, touchscreen, technologies, no, complex, processes, or, rare, materials, are, used, for, non, touchscreen, applications, other, plastics, e, g, vinyl, or, abs, may, be, used, the, film, can, be, blow, molded, or, heat, formed, into, complex, three, dimensional, shapes, such, as, bottles, globes, or, car, dashboards, alternatively, the, wires, can, be, embedded, in, thick, plastic, such, as, fiber, glass, or, carbon, fiber, body, panels, single, touch, resistive, touchscreens, in, the, resistive, approach, which, used, to, be, the, most, popular, technique, there, are, typically, four, layers, when, a, user, touches, the, surface, the, system, records, the, change, in, the, electric, current, that, flows, through, the, display, dispersive, signal, dispersive, signal, technology, measures, the, piezoelectric, effect, the, voltage, generated, when, mechanical, force, is, applied, to, a, material, that, occurs, chemically, when, a, strengthened, glass, substrate, is, touched, infrared, there, are, two, infrared, based, approaches, in, one, an, array, of, sensors, detects, a, finger, touching, or, almost, touching, the, display, thereby, interrupting, infrared, light, beams, projected, over, the, screen, in, the, other, bottom, mounted, infrared, cameras, record, heat, from, screen, touches, in, each, case, the, system, determines, the, intended, command, based, on, the, controls, showing, on, the, screen, at, the, time, and, the, location, of, the, touch, the, development, of, multi, touch, screens, facilitated, the, tracking, of, more, than, one, finger, on, the, screen, thus, operations, that, require, more, than, one, finger, are, possible, these, devices, also, allow, multiple, users, to, interact, with, the, touchscreen, simultaneously, with, the, growing, use, of, touchscreens, the, cost, of, touchscreen, technology, is, routinely, absorbed, into, the, products, that, incorporate, it, and, is, nearly, eliminated, touchscreen, technology, has, demonstrated, reliability, and, is, found, in, airplanes, automobiles, gaming, consoles, machine, control, systems, appliances, and, handheld, display, devices, including, cellphones, the, touchscreen, market, for, mobile, devices, was, projected, to, produce, us, 5, billion, by, 2009, the, ability, to, accurately, point, on, the, screen, itself, is, also, advancing, with, the, emerging, graphics, tablet, screen, hybrids, polyvinylidene, fluoride, pvdf, plays, a, major, role, in, this, innovation, due, its, high, piezoelectric, properties, which, allow, the, tablet, to, sense, pressure, making, such, things, as, digital, painting, behave, more, like, paper, and, pencil, tapsense, announced, in, october, 2011, allows, touchscreens, to, distinguish, what, part, of, the, hand, was, used, for, input, such, as, the, fingertip, knuckle, and, fingernail, this, could, be, used, in, a, variety, of, ways, for, example, to, copy, and, paste, to, capitalize, letters, to, activate, different, drawing, modes, etc, for, touchscreens, to, be, effective, input, devices, users, must, be, able, to, accurately, select, targets, and, avoid, accidental, selection, of, adjacent, targets, the, design, of, touchscreen, interfaces, should, reflect, technical, capabilities, of, the, system, ergonomics, cognitive, psychology, and, human, physiology, guidelines, for, touchscreen, designs, were, first, developed, in, the, 2000s, based, on, early, research, and, actual, use, of, older, systems, typically, using, infrared, grids, which, were, highly, dependent, on, the, size, of, the, user, s, fingers, these, guidelines, are, less, relevant, for, the, bulk, of, modern, touch, devices, which, use, capacitive, or, resistive, touch, technology, from, the, mid, 2000s, makers, of, operating, systems, for, smartphones, have, promulgated, standards, but, these, vary, between, manufacturers, and, allow, for, significant, variation, in, size, based, on, technology, changes, so, are, unsuitable, from, a, human, factors, perspective, much, more, important, is, the, accuracy, humans, have, in, selecting, targets, with, their, finger, or, a, pen, stylus, the, accuracy, of, user, selection, varies, by, position, on, the, screen, users, are, most, accurate, at, the, center, less, so, at, the, left, and, right, edges, and, least, accurate, at, the, top, edge, and, especially, the, bottom, edge, the, r95, accuracy, required, radius, for, 95, target, accuracy, varies, from, 7, mm, 0, 28, in, in, the, center, to, 12, mm, 0, 47, in, in, the, lower, corners, users, are, subconsciously, aware, of, this, and, take, more, time, to, select, targets, which, are, smaller, or, at, the, edges, or, corners, of, the, touchscreen, this, user, inaccuracy, is, a, result, of, parallax, visual, acuity, and, the, speed, of, the, feedback, loop, between, the, eyes, and, fingers, the, precision, of, the, human, finger, alone, is, much, much, higher, than, this, so, when, assistive, technologies, are, provided, such, as, on, screen, magnifiers, users, can, move, their, finger, once, in, contact, with, the, screen, with, precision, as, small, as, 0, 1, mm, 0, 004, in, users, of, handheld, and, portable, touchscreen, devices, hold, them, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, routinely, change, their, method, of, holding, and, selection, to, suit, the, position, and, type, of, input, there, are, four, basic, types, of, handheld, interaction, use, rates, vary, widely, while, two, thumb, tapping, is, encountered, rarely, 1, 3, for, many, general, interactions, it, is, used, for, 41, of, typing, interaction, in, addition, devices, are, often, placed, on, surfaces, desks, or, tables, and, tablets, especially, are, used, in, stands, the, user, may, point, select, or, gesture, in, these, cases, with, their, finger, or, thumb, and, vary, use, of, these, methods, touchscreens, are, often, used, with, haptic, response, systems, a, common, example, of, this, technology, is, the, vibratory, feedback, provided, when, a, button, on, the, touchscreen, is, tapped, haptics, are, used, to, improve, the, user, s, experience, with, touchscreens, by, providing, simulated, tactile, feedback, and, can, be, designed, to, react, immediately, partly, countering, on, screen, response, latency, research, from, the, university, of, glasgow, brewster, chohan, and, brown, 2007, and, more, recently, hogan, demonstrates, that, touchscreen, users, reduce, input, errors, by, 20, increase, input, speed, by, 20, and, lower, their, cognitive, load, by, 40, when, touchscreens, are, combined, with, haptics, or, tactile, feedback, on, top, of, this, a, study, conducted, in, 2013, by, boston, college, explored, the, effects, that, touchscreens, haptic, stimulation, had, on, triggering, psychological, ownership, of, a, product, their, research, concluded, that, a, touchscreens, ability, to, incorporate, high, amounts, of, haptic, involvement, resulted, in, customers, feeling, more, endowment, to, the, products, they, were, designing, or, buying, the, study, also, reported, that, consumers, using, a, touchscreen, were, willing, to, accept, a, higher, price, point, for, the, items, they, were, purchasing, touchscreen, technology, has, become, integrated, into, many, aspects, of, customer, service, industry, in, the, 21st, century, the, restaurant, industry, is, a, good, example, of, touchscreen, implementation, into, this, domain, chain, restaurants, such, as, taco, bell, panera, bread, and, mcdonald, s, offer, touchscreens, as, an, option, when, customers, are, ordering, items, off, the, menu, while, the, addition, of, touchscreens, is, a, development, for, this, industry, customers, may, choose, to, bypass, the, touchscreen, and, order, from, a, traditional, cashier, to, take, this, a, step, further, a, restaurant, in, bangalore, has, attempted, to, completely, automate, the, ordering, process, customers, sit, down, to, a, table, embedded, with, touchscreens, and, order, off, an, extensive, menu, once, the, order, is, placed, it, is, sent, electronically, to, the, kitchen, these, types, of, touchscreens, fit, under, the, point, of, sale, pos, systems, mentioned, in, the, lead, section, extended, use, of, gestural, interfaces, without, the, ability, of, the, user, to, rest, their, arm, is, referred, to, as, gorilla, arm, it, can, result, in, fatigue, and, even, repetitive, stress, injury, when, routinely, used, in, a, work, setting, certain, early, pen, based, interfaces, required, the, operator, to, work, in, this, position, for, much, of, the, workday, allowing, the, user, to, rest, their, hand, or, arm, on, the, input, device, or, a, frame, around, it, is, a, solution, for, this, in, many, contexts, this, phenomenon, is, often, cited, as, an, example, of, movements, to, be, minimized, by, proper, ergonomic, design, unsupported, touchscreens, are, still, fairly, common, in, applications, such, as, atms, and, data, kiosks, but, are, not, an, issue, as, the, typical, user, only, engages, for, brief, and, widely, spaced, periods, touchscreens, can, suffer, from, the, problem, of, fingerprints, on, the, display, this, can, be, mitigated, by, the, use, of, materials, with, optical, coatings, designed, to, reduce, the, visible, effects, of, fingerprint, oils, most, modern, smartphones, have, oleophobic, coatings, which, lessen, the, amount, of, oil, residue, another, option, is, to, install, a, matte, finish, anti, glare, screen, protector, which, creates, a, slightly, roughened, surface, that, does, not, easily, retain, smudges, capacitive, touchscreens, rarely, work, when, the, user, wears, gloves, the, thickness, of, the, glove, and, the, material, they, are, made, of, play, a, significant, role, on, that, and, the, ability, of, a, touchscreen, to, pick, up, a, touch, some, devices, have, a, mode, which, increases, the, sensitivity, of, the, touchscreen, this, allows, the, touchscreen, to, be, used, more, reliably, with, gloves, but, can, also, result, in, unreliable, and, phantom, inputs, however, thin, gloves, such, as, medical, gloves, are, thin, enough, for, users, to, wear, when, using, touchscreens, mostly, applicable, to, medical, technology, and, machines
