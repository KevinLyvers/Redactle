sailing, employs, the, wind, acting, on, sails, wingsails, or, kites, to, propel, a, craft, on, the, surface, of, the, water, sailing, ship, sailboat, raft, windsurfer, or, kitesurfer, on, ice, iceboat, or, on, land, land, yacht, over, a, chosen, course, which, is, often, part, of, a, larger, plan, of, navigation, from, prehistory, until, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, sailing, craft, were, the, primary, means, of, maritime, trade, and, transportation, exploration, across, the, seas, and, oceans, was, reliant, on, sail, for, anything, other, than, the, shortest, distances, naval, power, in, this, period, used, sail, to, varying, degrees, depending, on, the, current, technology, culminating, in, the, gun, armed, sailing, warships, of, the, age, of, sail, sail, was, slowly, replaced, by, steam, as, the, method, of, propulsion, for, ships, over, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, seeing, a, gradual, improvement, in, the, technology, of, steam, through, a, number, of, developmental, steps, steam, allowed, scheduled, services, that, ran, at, higher, average, speeds, than, sailing, vessels, large, improvements, in, fuel, economy, allowed, steam, to, progressively, outcompete, sail, in, ultimately, all, commercial, situations, giving, ship, owning, investors, a, better, return, on, capital, 9, 16, in, the, 21st, century, most, sailing, represents, a, form, of, recreation, or, sport, recreational, sailing, or, yachting, can, be, divided, into, racing, and, cruising, cruising, can, include, extended, offshore, and, ocean, crossing, trips, coastal, sailing, within, sight, of, land, and, daysailing, sailing, relies, on, the, physics, of, sails, as, they, derive, power, from, the, wind, generating, both, lift, and, drag, on, a, given, course, the, sails, are, set, to, an, angle, that, optimizes, the, development, of, wind, power, as, determined, by, the, apparent, wind, which, is, the, wind, as, sensed, from, a, moving, vessel, the, forces, transmitted, via, the, sails, are, resisted, by, forces, from, the, hull, keel, and, rudder, of, a, sailing, craft, by, forces, from, skate, runners, of, an, iceboat, or, by, forces, from, wheels, of, a, land, sailing, craft, which, are, steering, the, course, this, combination, of, forces, means, that, it, is, possible, to, sail, an, upwind, course, as, well, as, downwind, the, course, with, respect, to, the, true, wind, direction, as, would, be, indicated, by, a, stationary, flag, is, called, a, point, of, sail, conventional, sailing, craft, cannot, derive, wind, power, on, a, course, with, a, point, of, sail, that, is, too, close, into, the, wind, throughout, history, sailing, was, a, key, form, of, propulsion, that, allowed, for, greater, mobility, than, travel, over, land, this, greater, mobility, increased, capacity, for, exploration, trade, transport, warfare, and, fishing, especially, when, compared, to, overland, options, ch, 2, until, the, significant, improvements, in, land, transportation, that, occurred, during, the, 19th, century, if, water, transport, was, an, option, it, was, faster, cheaper, and, safer, than, making, the, same, journey, by, land, this, applied, equally, to, sea, crossings, coastal, voyages, and, use, of, rivers, and, lakes, examples, of, the, consequences, of, this, include, the, large, grain, trade, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, classical, period, cities, such, as, rome, were, totally, reliant, on, the, delivery, by, sailing, ships, of, the, large, amounts, of, grain, needed, it, has, been, estimated, that, it, cost, less, for, a, sailing, ship, of, the, roman, empire, to, carry, grain, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, than, to, move, the, same, amount, 15, miles, by, road, rome, consumed, about, 150, 000, tons, of, egyptian, grain, each, year, over, the, first, three, centuries, ad, 297, ch, 2, 147, a, similar, but, more, recent, trade, in, coal, was, from, the, mines, situated, close, to, the, river, tyne, to, london, which, was, already, being, carried, out, in, the, 14th, century, and, grew, as, the, city, increased, in, size, in, 1795, 4, 395, cargoes, of, coal, were, delivered, to, london, this, would, have, needed, a, fleet, of, about, 500, sailing, colliers, making, 8, or, 9, trips, a, year, this, quantity, had, doubled, by, 1839, the, first, steam, powered, collier, was, not, launched, until, 1852, and, sailing, colliers, continued, working, into, the, 20th, century, the, earliest, image, suggesting, the, use, of, sail, on, a, boat, may, be, on, a, piece, of, pottery, from, mesopotamia, dated, to, the, 6th, millennium, bce, the, image, is, thought, to, show, a, bipod, mast, mounted, on, the, hull, of, a, reed, boat, no, sail, is, depicted, the, earliest, representation, of, a, sail, from, egypt, is, dated, to, circa, 3100, bce, figure, 6, the, nile, is, considered, a, suitable, place, for, early, use, of, sail, for, propulsion, this, is, because, the, river, s, current, flows, from, south, to, north, whilst, the, prevailing, wind, direction, is, north, to, south, therefore, a, boat, of, that, time, could, use, the, current, to, go, north, an, unobstructed, trip, of, 750, miles, and, sail, to, make, the, return, trip, 11, evidence, of, early, sailors, has, also, been, found, in, other, locations, such, as, kuwait, turkey, syria, minoa, bahrain, and, india, among, others, austronesian, peoples, used, sails, from, some, time, before, 2000, bce, 144, their, expansion, from, what, is, now, southern, china, and, taiwan, started, in, 3000, bce, their, technology, came, to, include, outriggers, catamarans, and, crab, claw, sails, which, enabled, the, austronesian, expansion, at, around, 3000, to, 1500, bce, into, the, islands, of, maritime, southeast, asia, and, thence, to, micronesia, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, since, there, is, no, commonality, between, the, boat, technology, of, china, and, the, austronesians, these, distinctive, characteristics, must, have, been, developed, at, or, some, time, after, the, beginning, of, the, expansion, they, traveled, vast, distances, of, open, ocean, in, outrigger, canoes, using, navigation, methods, such, as, stick, charts, the, windward, sailing, capability, of, austronesian, boats, allowed, a, strategy, of, sailing, to, windward, on, a, voyage, of, exploration, with, a, return, downwind, either, to, report, a, discovery, or, if, no, land, was, found, this, was, well, suited, to, the, prevailing, winds, as, pacific, islands, were, steadily, colonized, by, the, time, of, the, age, of, discovery, starting, in, the, 15th, century, square, rigged, multi, masted, vessels, were, the, norm, and, were, guided, by, navigation, techniques, that, included, the, magnetic, compass, and, making, sightings, of, the, sun, and, stars, that, allowed, transoceanic, voyages, during, the, age, of, discovery, sailing, ships, figured, in, european, voyages, around, africa, to, china, and, japan, and, across, the, atlantic, ocean, to, north, and, south, america, later, sailing, ships, ventured, into, the, arctic, to, explore, northern, sea, routes, and, assess, natural, resources, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, sailing, vessels, made, hydrographic, surveys, to, develop, charts, for, navigation, and, at, times, carried, scientists, aboard, as, with, the, voyages, of, james, cook, and, the, second, voyage, of, hms, beagle, with, naturalist, charles, darwin, in, the, early, 1800s, fast, blockade, running, schooners, and, brigantines, baltimore, clippers, evolved, into, three, masted, typically, ship, rigged, sailing, vessels, with, fine, lines, that, enhanced, speed, but, lessened, capacity, for, high, value, cargo, like, tea, from, china, masts, were, as, high, as, 100, feet, 30, m, and, were, able, to, achieve, speeds, of, 19, knots, 35, km, h, allowing, for, passages, of, up, to, 465, nautical, miles, 861, km, per, 24, hours, clippers, yielded, to, bulkier, slower, vessels, which, became, economically, competitive, in, the, mid, 19th, century, sail, plans, with, just, fore, and, aft, sails, schooners, or, a, mixture, of, the, two, brigantines, barques, and, barquentines, emerged, coastal, top, sail, schooners, with, a, crew, as, small, as, two, managing, the, sail, handling, became, an, efficient, way, to, carry, bulk, cargo, since, only, the, fore, sails, required, tending, while, tacking, and, steam, driven, machinery, was, often, available, for, raising, the, sails, and, the, anchor, iron, hulled, sailing, ships, represented, the, final, evolution, of, sailing, ships, at, the, end, of, the, age, of, sail, they, were, built, to, carry, bulk, cargo, for, long, distances, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, they, were, the, largest, of, merchant, sailing, ships, with, three, to, five, masts, and, square, sails, as, well, as, other, sail, plans, they, carried, bulk, cargoes, between, continents, iron, hulled, sailing, ships, were, mainly, built, from, the, 1870s, to, 1900, when, steamships, began, to, outpace, them, economically, because, of, their, ability, to, keep, a, schedule, regardless, of, the, wind, steel, hulls, also, replaced, iron, hulls, at, around, the, same, time, even, into, the, twentieth, century, sailing, ships, could, hold, their, own, on, transoceanic, voyages, such, as, australia, to, europe, since, they, did, not, require, bunkerage, for, coal, nor, fresh, water, for, steam, and, they, were, faster, than, the, early, steamers, which, usually, could, barely, make, 8, knots, 15, km, h, ultimately, the, steamships, independence, from, the, wind, and, their, ability, to, take, shorter, routes, passing, through, the, suez, and, panama, canals, made, sailing, ships, uneconomical, until, the, general, adoption, of, carvel, built, ships, that, relied, on, an, internal, skeleton, structure, to, bear, the, weight, of, the, ship, and, for, gun, ports, to, be, cut, in, the, side, sailing, ships, were, just, vehicles, for, delivering, fighters, to, the, enemy, for, engagement, early, phoenician, greek, roman, galleys, would, ram, each, other, then, pour, onto, the, decks, of, the, opposing, force, and, continue, the, fight, by, hand, meaning, that, these, galleys, required, speed, and, maneuverability, this, need, for, speed, translated, into, longer, ships, with, multiple, rows, of, oars, along, the, sides, known, as, biremes, and, triremes, typically, the, sailing, ships, during, this, time, period, were, the, merchant, ships, by, 1500, gun, ports, allowed, sailing, vessels, to, sail, alongside, an, enemy, vessel, and, fire, a, broadside, of, multiple, cannon, this, development, allowed, for, naval, fleets, to, array, themselves, into, a, line, of, battle, whereby, warships, would, maintain, their, place, in, the, line, to, engage, the, enemy, in, a, parallel, or, perpendicular, line, while, the, use, of, sailing, vessels, for, commerce, or, naval, power, has, been, supplanted, with, engine, driven, vessels, there, continue, to, be, commercial, operations, that, take, passengers, on, sailing, cruises, modern, navies, also, employ, sailing, vessels, to, train, cadets, in, seamanship, recreation, or, sport, accounts, for, the, bulk, of, sailing, in, modern, boats, recreational, sailing, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, day, sailing, where, one, gets, off, the, boat, for, the, night, and, cruising, where, one, stays, aboard, day, sailing, primarily, affords, experiencing, the, pleasure, of, sailing, a, boat, no, destination, is, required, it, is, an, opportunity, to, share, the, experience, with, others, a, variety, of, boats, with, no, overnight, accommodations, ranging, in, size, from, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, to, over, 30, feet, 9, 1, m, may, be, regarded, as, day, sailors, cruising, on, a, sailing, yacht, may, be, either, near, shore, or, passage, making, out, of, sight, of, land, and, entails, the, use, of, sailboats, that, support, sustained, overnight, use, coastal, cruising, grounds, include, areas, of, the, mediterranean, and, black, seas, northern, europe, western, europe, and, islands, of, the, north, atlantic, west, africa, and, the, islands, of, the, south, atlantic, the, caribbean, and, regions, of, north, and, central, america, passage, making, under, sail, occurs, on, routes, through, oceans, all, over, the, world, circular, routes, exist, between, the, americas, and, europe, and, between, south, africa, and, south, america, there, are, many, routes, from, the, americas, australia, new, zealand, and, asia, to, island, destinations, in, the, south, pacific, some, cruisers, circumnavigate, the, globe, sailing, as, a, sport, is, organized, on, a, hierarchical, basis, starting, at, the, yacht, club, level, and, reaching, up, into, national, and, international, federations, it, may, entail, racing, yachts, sailing, dinghies, or, other, small, open, sailing, craft, including, iceboats, and, land, yachts, sailboat, racing, is, governed, by, world, sailing, with, most, racing, formats, using, the, racing, rules, of, sailing, it, entails, a, variety, of, different, disciplines, including, a, saildrone, is, a, type, of, unmanned, surface, vehicle, used, primarily, in, oceans, for, data, collection, saildrones, are, wind, and, solar, powered, and, carry, a, suite, of, science, sensors, and, navigational, instruments, they, can, follow, a, set, of, remotely, prescribed, waypoints, the, saildrone, was, invented, by, richard, jenkins, a, british, engineer, founder, and, ceo, of, saildrone, inc, saildrones, have, been, used, by, scientists, and, research, organizations, like, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, to, survey, the, marine, ecosystem, fisheries, and, weather, in, january, 2019, a, small, fleet, of, saildrones, was, launched, to, attempt, the, first, autonomous, circumnavigation, of, antarctica, one, of, the, saildrones, completed, the, mission, traveling, 12, 500, miles, 20, 100, km, over, the, seven, month, journey, while, collecting, a, detailed, data,

october, it, completed, the, return, trip, to, become, the, first, autonomous, vehicle, to, cross, the, atlantic, in, both, directions, the, university, of, washington, and, the, saildrone, company, began, a, joint, venture, in, 2019, called, the, saildrone, pacific, sentinel, experiment, which, positioned, six, saildrones, along, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, to, gather, atmospheric, and, ocean, data, a, sailing, craft, s, ability, to, derive, power, from, the, wind, depends, on, the, point, of, sail, it, is, on, the, direction, of, travel, under, sail, in, relation, to, the, true, wind, direction, over, the, surface, the, principal, points, of, sail, roughly, correspond, to, 45, segments, of, a, circle, starting, with, 0, directly, into, the, wind, for, many, sailing, craft, the, arc, spanning, 45, on, either, side, of, the, wind, is, a, no, go, zone, where, a, sail, is, unable, to, mobilize, power, from, the, wind, sailing, on, a, course, as, close, to, the, wind, as, possible, approximately, 45, is, termed, close, hauled, at, 90, off, the, wind, a, craft, is, on, a, beam, reach, at, 135, off, the, wind, a, craft, is, on, a, broad, reach, at, 180, off, the, wind, sailing, in, the, same, direction, as, the, wind, a, craft, is, running, downwind, in, points, of, sail, that, range, from, close, hauled, to, a, broad, reach, sails, act, substantially, like, a, wing, with, lift, predominantly, propelling, the, craft, in, points, of, sail, from, a, broad, reach, to, down, wind, sails, act, substantially, like, a, parachute, with, drag, predominantly, propelling, the, craft, for, craft, with, little, forward, resistance, such, as, ice, boats, and, land, yachts, this, transition, occurs, further, off, the, wind, than, for, sailboats, and, sailing, ships, wind, direction, for, points, of, sail, always, refers, to, the, true, wind, the, wind, felt, by, a, stationary, observer, the, apparent, wind, the, wind, felt, by, an, observer, on, a, moving, sailing, craft, determines, the, motive, power, for, sailing, craft, the, waves, give, an, indication, of, the, true, wind, direction, the, flag, gives, an, indication, of, apparent, wind, direction, true, wind, velocity, v, t, combines, with, the, sailing, craft, s, velocity, v, b, to, give, the, apparent, wind, velocity, v, a, the, air, velocity, experienced, by, instrumentation, or, crew, on, a, moving, sailing, craft, apparent, wind, velocity, provides, the, motive, power, for, the, sails, on, any, given, point, of, sail, it, varies, from, being, the, true, wind, velocity, of, a, stopped, craft, in, irons, in, the, no, go, zone, to, being, faster, than, the, true, wind, speed, as, the, sailing, craft, s, velocity, adds, to, the, true, windspeed, on, a, reach, it, diminishes, towards, zero, for, a, craft, sailing, dead, downwind, sailing, craft, a, is, close, hauled, sailing, craft, b, is, on, a, beam, reach, sailing, craft, c, is, on, a, broad, reach, boat, velocity, in, black, generates, an, equal, and, opposite, apparent, wind, component, not, shown, which, combines, with, the, true, wind, to, become, apparent, wind, the, speed, of, sailboats, through, the, water, is, limited, by, the, resistance, that, results, from, hull, drag, in, the, water, ice, boats, typically, have, the, least, resistance, to, forward, motion, of, any, sailing, craft, consequently, a, sailboat, experiences, a, wider, range, of, apparent, wind, angles, than, does, an, ice, boat, whose, speed, is, typically, great, enough, to, have, the, apparent, wind, coming, from, a, few, degrees, to, one, side, of, its, course, necessitating, sailing, with, the, sail, sheeted, in, for, most, points, of, sail, on, conventional, sailboats, the, sails, are, set, to, create, lift, for, those, points, of, sail, where, it, s, possible, to, align, the, leading, edge, of, the, sail, with, the, apparent, wind, for, a, sailboat, point, of, sail, affects, lateral, force, significantly, the, higher, the, boat, points, to, the, wind, under, sail, the, stronger, the, lateral, force, which, requires, resistance, from, a, keel, or, other, underwater, foils, including, daggerboard, centerboard, skeg, and, rudder, lateral, force, also, induces, heeling, in, a, sailboat, which, requires, resistance, by, weight, of, ballast, from, the, crew, or, the, boat, itself, and, by, the, shape, of, the, boat, especially, with, a, catamaran, as, the, boat, points, off, the, wind, lateral, force, and, the, forces, required, to, resist, it, become, less, important, on, ice, boats, lateral, forces, are, countered, by, the, lateral, resistance, of, the, blades, on, ice, and, their, distance, apart, which, generally, prevents, heeling, wind, and, currents, are, important, factors, to, plan, on, for, both, offshore, and, inshore, sailing, predicting, the, availability, strength, and, direction, of, the, wind, is, key, to, using, its, power, along, the, desired, course, ocean, currents, tides, and, river, currents, may, deflect, a, sailing, vessel, from, its, desired, course, if, the, desired, course, is, within, the, no, go, zone, then, the, sailing, craft, must, follow, a, zig, zag, route, into, the, wind, to, reach, its, waypoint, or, destination, downwind, certain, high, performance, sailing, craft, can, reach, the, destination, more, quickly, by, following, a, zig, zag, route, on, a, series, of, broad, reaches, negotiating, obstructions, or, a, channel, may, also, require, a, change, of, direction, with, respect, to, the, wind, necessitating, changing, of, tack, with, the, wind, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, craft, from, before, changing, tack, is, called, tacking, when, the, wind, crosses, over, the, bow, of, the, craft, as, it, turns, and, jibing, or, gybing, if, the, wind, passes, over, the, stern, a, sailing, craft, can, sail, on, a, course, anywhere, outside, of, its, no, go, zone, if, the, next, waypoint, or, destination, is, within, the, arc, defined, by, the, no, go, zone, from, the, craft, s, current, position, then, it, must, perform, a, series, of, tacking, maneuvers, to, get, there, on, a, zigzag, route, called, beating, to, windward, the, progress, along, that, route, is, called, the, course, made, good, the, speed, between, the, starting, and, ending, points, of, the, route, is, called, the, speed, made, good, and, is, calculated, by, the, distance, between, the, two, points, divided, by, the, travel, time, the, limiting, line, to, the, waypoint, that, allows, the, sailing, vessel, to, leave, it, to, leeward, is, called, the, layline, whereas, some, bermuda, rigged, sailing, yachts, can, sail, as, close, as, 30, to, the, wind, most, 20th, century, square, riggers, are, limited, to, 60, off, the, wind, fore, and, aft, rigs, are, designed, to, operate, with, the, wind, on, either, side, whereas, square, rigs, and, kites, are, designed, to, have, the, wind, come, from, one, side, of, the, sail, only, because, the, lateral, wind, forces, are, highest, when, sailing, close, hauled, the, resisting, water, forces, around, the, vessel, s, keel, centerboard, rudder, and, other, foils, must, also, be, highest, in, order, to, limit, sideways, motion, or, leeway, ice, boats, and, land, yachts, minimize, lateral, motion, with, resistance, from, their, blades, or, wheels, tacking, or, coming, about, is, a, maneuver, by, which, a, sailing, craft, turns, its, bow, into, and, through, the, wind, referred, to, as, the, eye, of, the, wind, so, that, the, apparent, wind, changes, from, one, side, to, the, other, allowing, progress, on, the, opposite, tack, the, type, of, sailing, rig, dictates, the, procedures, and, constraints, on, achieving, a, tacking, maneuver,

and, windsurfers, have, flexibly, pivoting, and, fully, rotating, masts, that, get, flipped, from, side, to, side, a, sailing, craft, can, travel, directly, downwind, only, at, a, speed, that, is, less, than, the, wind, speed, however, some, sailing, craft, such, as, iceboats, sand, yachts, and, some, high, performance, sailboats, can, achieve, a, higher, downwind, velocity, made, good, by, traveling, on, a, series, of, broad, reaches, punctuated, by, jibes, in, between, it, was, explored, by, sailing, vessels, starting, in, 1975, and, now, extends, to, high, performance, skiffs, catamarans, and, foiling, sailboats, navigating, a, channel, or, a, downwind, course, among, obstructions, may, necessitate, changes, in, direction, that, require, a, change, of, tack, accomplished, with, a, jibe, jibing, or, gybing, is, a, sailing, maneuver, by, which, a, sailing, craft, turns, its, stern, past, the, eye, of, the, wind, so, that, the, apparent, wind, changes, from, one, side, to, the, other, allowing, progress, on, the, opposite, tack, this, maneuver, can, be, done, on, smaller, boats, by, pulling, the, tiller, towards, yourself, the, opposite, side, of, the, sail, as, with, tacking, the, type, of, sailing, rig, dictates, the, procedures, and, constraints, for, jibing, fore, and, aft, sails, with, booms, gaffs, or, sprits, are, unstable, when, the, free, end, points, into, the, eye, of, the, wind, and, must, be, controlled, to, avoid, a, violent, change, to, the, other, side, square, rigs, as, they, present, the, full, area, of, the, sail, to, the, wind, from, the, rear, experience, little, change, of, operation, from, one, tack, to, the, other, and, windsurfers, again, have, flexibly, pivoting, and, fully, rotating, masts, that, get, flipped, from,

that, control, angle, of, the, sails, with, respect, to, the, wind, the, halyards, that, raise, and, tighten, the, sail, and, to, adjusting, the, hull, s, resistance, to, heeling, yawing, or, progress, through, the, water, in, their, most, developed, version, square, sails, are, controlled, by, two, each, of, sheets, braces, clewlines, and, reef, tackles, plus, four, buntlines, each, of, which, may, be, controlled, by, a, crew, member, as, the, sail, is, adjusted, towards, the, end, of, the, age, of, sail, steam, powered, machinery, reduced, the, number, of, crew, required, to, trim, sail, adjustment, of, the, angle, of, a, fore, and, aft, sail, with, respect, to, the, apparent, wind, is, controlled, with, a, line, called, a, sheet, on, points, of, sail, between, close, hauled, and, a, broad, reach, the, goal, is, typically, to, create, flow, along, the, sail, to, maximize, power, through, lift, streamers, placed, on, the, surface, of, the, sail, called, tell, tales, indicate, whether, that, flow, is, smooth, or, turbulent, smooth, flow, on, both, sides, indicates, proper, trim, a, jib, and, mainsail, are, typically, configured, to, be, adjusted, to, create, a, smooth, laminar, flow, leading, from, one, to, the, other, in, what, is, called, the, slot, effect, on, downwind, points, of, sail, power, is, achieved, primarily, with, the, wind, pushing, on, the, sail, as, indicated, by, drooping, tell, tales, spinnakers, are, light, weight, large, area, highly, curved, sails, that, are, adapted, to, sailing, off, the, wind, in, addition, to, using, the, sheets, to, adjust, the, angle, with, respect, to, the, apparent, wind, other, lines, control, the, shape, of, the, sail, notably, the, outhaul, halyard, boom, vang, and, backstay, these, control, the, curvature, that, is, appropriate, to, the, windspeed, the, higher, the, wind, the, flatter, the, sail, when, the, wind, strength, is, greater, than, these, adjustments, can, accommodate, to, prevent, overpowering, the, sailing, craft, then, reducing, sail, area, through, reefing, substituting, a, smaller, sail, or, by, other, means, reducing, sail, on, square, rigged, ships, could, be, accomplished, by, exposing, less, of, each, sail, by, tying, it, off, higher, up, with, reefing, points, additionally, as, winds, get, stronger, sails, can, be, furled, or, removed, from, the, spars, entirely, until, the, vessel, is, surviving, hurricane, force, winds, under, bare, poles, 137, on, fore, and, aft, rigged, vessels, reducing, sail, may, furling, the, jib, and, by, reefing, or, partially, lowering, the, mainsail, that, is, reducing, the, area, of, a, sail, without, actually, changing, it, for, a, smaller, sail, this, results, both, in, a, reduced, sail, area, but, also, in, a, lower, centre, of, effort, from, the, sails, reducing, the, heeling, moment, and, keeping, the, boat, more, upright, there, are, three, common, methods, of, reefing, the, mainsail, hull, trim, has, three, aspects, each, tied, to, an, axis, of, rotation, they, are, controlling, 131, 5, each, is, a, reaction, to, forces, on, sails, and, is, achieved, either, by, weight, distribution, or, by, management, of, the, center, of, force, of, the, underwater, foils, keel, daggerboard, etc, compared, with, the, center, of, force, on, the, sails, a, sailing, vessel, heels, when, the, boat, leans, over, to, the, side, in, reaction, to, wind, forces, on, the, sails, a, sailing, vessel, s, form, stability, derived, from, the, shape, of, the, hull, and, the, position, of, the, center, of, gravity, is, the, starting, point, for, resisting, heeling, catamarans, and, iceboats, have, a, wide, stance, that, makes, them, resistant, to, heeling, additional, measures, for, trimming, a, sailing, craft, to, control, heeling, include, 131, 5, the, alignment, of, center, of, force, of, the, sails, with, center, of, resistance, of, the, hull, and, its, appendices, controls, whether, the, craft, will, track, straight, with, little, steering, input, or, whether, correction, needs, to, be, made, to, hold, it, away, from, turning, into, the, wind, a, weather, helm, or, turning, away, from, the, wind, a, lee, helm, a, center, of, force, behind, the, center, of, resistance, causes, a, weather, helm, the, center, of, force, ahead, of, the, center, of, resistance, causes, a, lee, helm, when, the, two, are, closely, aligned, the, helm, is, neutral, and, requires, little, input, to, maintain, course, 131, 5, fore, and, aft, weight, distribution, changes, the, cross, section, of, a, vessel, in, the, water, small, sailing, craft, are, sensitive, to, crew, placement, they, are, usually, designed, to, have, the, crew, stationed, midships, to, minimize, hull, drag, in, the, water, 131, 5, seamanship, encompasses, all, aspects, of, taking, a, sailing, vessel, in, and, out, of, port, navigating, it, to, its, destination, and, securing, it, at, anchor, or, alongside, a, dock, important, aspects, of, seamanship, include, employing, a, common, language, aboard, a, sailing, craft, and, the, management, of, lines, that, control, the, sails, and, rigging, nautical, terms, for, elements, of, a, vessel, starboard, right, hand, side, port, or, larboard, left, hand, side, forward, or, fore, frontward, aft, or, abaft, rearward, bow, forward, part, of, the, hull, stern, aft, part, of, the, hull, beam, the, widest, part, spars, supporting, sails, include, masts, booms, yards, gaffs, and, poles, moveable, lines, that, control, sails, or, other, equipment, are, known, collectively, as, a, vessel, s, running, rigging, lines, that, raise, sails, are, called, halyards, while, those, that, strike, them, are, called, downhauls, lines, that, adjust, trim, the, sails, are, called, sheets, these, are, often, referred, to, using, the, name, of, the, sail, they, control, such, as, main, sheet, or, jib, sheet, guys, are, used, to, control, the, ends, of, other, spars, such, as, spinnaker, poles, lines, used, to, tie, a, boat, up, when, alongside, are, called, docklines, docking, cables, or, mooring, warps, a, rode, is, what, attaches, an, anchored, boat, to, its, anchor, other, than, starboard, and, port, the, sides, of, the, boat, are, defined, by, their, relationship, to, the, wind, the, terms, to, describe, the, two, sides, are, windward, and, leeward, the, windward, side, of, the, boat, is, the, side, that, is, upwind, while, the, leeward, side, is, the, side, that, is, downwind, the, following, knots, are, commonly, used, to, handle, ropes, and, lines, on, sailing, craft, lines, and, halyards, are, typically, coiled, neatly, for, stowage, and, reuse, the, physics, of, sailing, arises, from, a, balance, of, forces, between, the, wind, powering, the, sailing, craft, as, it, passes, over, its, sails, and, the, resistance, by, the, sailing, craft, against, being, blown, off, course, which, is, provided, in, the, water, by, the, keel, rudder, underwater, foils, and, other, elements, of, the, underbody, of, a, sailboat, on, ice, by, the, runners, of, an, iceboat, or, on, land, by, the, wheels, of, a, sail, powered, land, vehicle, forces, on, sails, depend, on, wind, speed, and, direction, and, the, speed, and, direction, of, the, craft, the, speed, of, the, craft, at, a, given, point, of, sail, contributes, to, the, apparent, wind, the, wind, speed, and, direction, as, measured, on, the, moving, craft, the, apparent, wind, on, the, sail, creates, a, total, aerodynamic, force, which, may, be, resolved, into, drag, the, force, component, in, the, direction, of, the, apparent, wind, and, lift, the, force, component, normal, 90, to, the, apparent, wind, depending, on, the, alignment, of, the, sail, with, the, apparent, wind, angle, of, attack, lift, or, drag, may, be, the, predominant, propulsive, component, depending, on, the, angle, of, attack, of, a, set, of, sails, with, respect, to, the, apparent, wind, each, sail, is, providing, motive, force, to, the, sailing, craft, either, from, lift, dominant, attached, flow, or, drag, dominant, separated, flow, additionally, sails, may, interact, with, one, another, to, create, forces, that, are, different, from, the, sum, of, the, individual, contributions, of, each, sail, when, used, alone, the, term, velocity, refers, both, to, speed, and, direction, as, applied, to, wind, apparent, wind, velocity, v, a, is, the, air, velocity, acting, upon, the, leading, edge, of, the, most, forward, sail, or, as, experienced, by, instrumentation, or, crew, on, a, moving, sailing, craft, in, nautical, terminology, wind, speeds, are, normally, expressed, in, knots, and, wind, angles, in, degrees, all, sailing, craft, reach, a, constant, forward, velocity, v, b, for, a, given, true, wind, velocity, v, t, and, point, of, sail, the, craft, s, point, of, sail, affects, its, velocity, for, a, given, true, wind, velocity, conventional, sailing, craft, cannot, derive, power, from, the, wind, in, a, no, go, zone, that, is, approximately, 40, to, 50, away, from, the, true, wind, depending, on, the, craft, likewise, the, directly, downwind, speed, of, all, conventional, sailing, craft, is, limited, to, the, true, wind, speed, as, a, sailboat, sails, further, from, the, wind, the, apparent, wind, becomes, smaller, and, the, lateral, component, becomes, less, boat, speed, is, highest, on, the, beam, reach, to, act, like, an, airfoil, the, sail, on, a, sailboat, is, sheeted, further, out, as, the, course, is, further, off, the, wind, as, an, iceboat, sails, further, from, the, wind, the, apparent, wind, increases, slightly, and, the, boat, speed, is, highest, on, the, broad, reach, in, order, to, act, like, an, airfoil, the, sail, on, an, iceboat, is, sheeted, in, for, all, three, points, of, sail, lift, on, a, sail, acting, as, an, airfoil, occurs, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, the, incident, airstream, the, apparent, wind, velocity, for, the, headsail, and, is, a, result, of, pressure, differences, between, the, windward, and, leeward, surfaces, and, depends, on, the, angle, of, attack, sail, shape, air, density, and, speed, of, the, apparent, wind, the, lift, force, results, from, the, average, pressure, on, the, windward, surface, of, the, sail, being, higher, than, the, average, pressure, on, the, leeward, side, these, pressure, differences, arise, in, conjunction, with, the, curved, airflow, as, air, follows, a, curved, path, along, the, windward, side, of, a, sail, there, is, a, pressure, gradient, perpendicular, to, the, flow, direction, with, higher, pressure, on, the, outside, of, the, curve, and, lower, pressure, on, the, inside, to, generate, lift, a, sail, must, present, an, angle, of, attack, between, the, chord, line, of, the, sail, and, the, apparent, wind, velocity, the, angle, of, attack, is, a, function, of, both, the, craft, s, point, of, sail, and, how, the, sail, is, adjusted, with, respect, to, the, apparent, wind, as, the, lift, generated, by, a, sail, increases, so, does, lift, induced, drag, which, together, with, parasitic, drag, constitute, total, drag, which, acts, in, a, direction, parallel, to, the, incident, airstream, this, occurs, as, the, angle, of, attack, increases, with, sail, trim, or, change, of, course, and, causes, the, lift, coefficient, to, increase, up, to, the, point, of, aerodynamic, stall, along, with, the, lift, induced, drag, coefficient, at, the, onset, of, stall, lift, is, abruptly, decreased, as, is, lift, induced, drag, sails, with, the, apparent, wind, behind, them, especially, going, downwind, operate, in, a, stalled, condition, lift, and, drag, are, components, of, the, total, aerodynamic, force, on, sail, which, are, resisted, by, forces, in, the, water, for, a, boat, or, on, the, traveled, surface, for, an, iceboat, or, land, sailing, craft, sails, act, in, two, basic, modes, under, the, lift, predominant, mode, the, sail, behaves, in, a, manner, analogous, to, a, wing, with, airflow, attached, to, both, surfaces, under, the, drag, predominant, mode, the, sail, acts, in, a, manner, analogous, to, a, parachute, with, airflow, in, detached, flow, eddying, around, the, sail, sails, allow, progress, of, a, sailing, craft, to, windward, thanks, to, their, ability, to, generate, lift, and, the, craft, s, ability, to, resist, the, lateral, forces, that, result, each, sail, configuration, has, a, characteristic, coefficient, of, lift, and, attendant, coefficient, of, drag, which, can, be, determined, experimentally, and, calculated, theoretically, sailing, craft, orient, their, sails, with, a, favorable, angle, of, attack, between, the, entry, point, of, the, sail, and, the, apparent, wind, even, as, their, course, changes, the, ability, to, generate, lift, is, limited, by, sailing, too, close, to, the, wind, when, no, effective, angle, of, attack, is, available, to, generate, lift, causing, luffing, and, sailing, sufficiently, off, the, wind, that, the, sail, cannot, be, oriented, at, a, favorable, angle, of, attack, to, prevent, the, sail, from, stalling, with, flow, separation, when, sailing, craft, are, on, a, course, where, the, angle, between, the, sail, and, the, apparent, wind, the, angle, of, attack, exceeds, the, point, of, maximum, lift, separation, of, flow, occurs, drag, increases, and, lift, decreases, with, increasing, angle, of, attack, as, the, separation, becomes, progressively, pronounced, until, the, sail, is, perpendicular, to, the, apparent, wind, when, lift, becomes, negligible, and, drag, predominates, in, addition, to, the, sails, used, upwind, spinnakers, provide, area, and, curvature, appropriate, for, sailing, with, separated, flow, on, downwind, points, of, sail, analogous, to, parachutes, which, provide, both, lift, and, drag, wind, speed, increases, with, height, above, the, surface, at, the, same, time, wind, speed, may, vary, over, short, periods, of, time, as, gusts, wind, shear, affects, sailing, craft, in, motion, by, presenting, a, different, wind, speed, and, direction, at, different, heights, along, the, mast, wind, shear, occurs, because, of, friction, above, a, water, surface, slowing, the, flow, of, air, the, ratio, of, wind, at, the, surface, to, wind, at, a, height, above, the, surface, varies, by, a, power, law, with, an, exponent, of, 0, 11, 0, 13, over, the, ocean, this, means, that, a, 5, m, s, 9, 7, kn, wind, at, 3, m, above, the, water, would, be, approximately, 6, m, s, 12, kn, at, 15, m, 50, ft, above, the, water, in, hurricane, force, winds, with, 40, m, s, 78, kn, at, the, surface, the, speed, at, 15, m, 50, ft, would, be, 49, m, s, 95, kn, this, suggests, that, sails, that, reach, higher, above, the, surface, can, be, subject, to, stronger, wind, forces, that, move, the, centre, of, effort, on, them, higher, above, the, surface, and, increase, the, heeling, moment, additionally, apparent, wind, direction, moves, aft, with, height, above, water, which, may, necessitate, a, corresponding, twist, in, the, shape, of, the, sail, to, achieve, attached, flow, with, height, gusts, may, be, predicted, by, the, same, value, that, serves, as, an, exponent, for, wind, shear, serving, as, a, gust, factor, so, one, can, expect, gusts, to, be, about, 1, 5, times, stronger, than, the, prevailing, wind, speed, a, 10, knot, wind, might, gust, up, to, 15, knots, this, combined, with, changes, in, wind, direction, suggest, the, degree, to, which, a, sailing, craft, must, adjust, sail, angle, to, wind, gusts, on, a, given, course, waterborne, sailing, craft, rely, on, the, design, of, the, hull, and, keel, to, provide, minimal, forward, drag, in, opposition, to, the, sails, propulsive, power, and, maximum, resistance, to, the, sails, lateral, forces, in, modern, sailboats, drag, is, minimized, by, control, of, the, hull, s, shape, blunt, or, fine, appendages, and, slipperiness, the, keel, or, other, underwater, foils, provide, the, lateral, resistance, to, forces, on, the, sails, heeling, increases, both, drag, and, the, ability, of, the, boat, to, track, along, its, desired, course, wave, generation, for, a, displacement, hull, is, another, important, limitation, on, boat, speed, drag, from, its, form, is, described, by, a, prismatic, coefficient, c, p, displaced, volume, of, the, vessel, divided, by, waterline, length, times, maximum, displaced, section, area, the, maximum, value, of, c, p, 1, 0, being, for, a, constant, displace, cross, section, area, as, would, be, found, on, a, barge, for, modern, sailboats, values, of, 0, 53, c, p, 0, 6, are, likely, because, of, the, tapered, shape, of, the, submerged, hull, towards, both, ends, reducing, interior, volume, allows, creating, a, finer, hull, with, less, drag, because, a, keel, or, other, underwater, foil, produces, lift, it, also, produces, drag, which, increases, as, the, boat, heels, wetted, area, of, the, hull, affects, total, the, amount, of, friction, between, the, water, and, the, hull, s, surface, creating, another, component, of, drag, sailboats, use, some, sort, of, underwater, foil, to, generate, lift, that, maintains, the, forward, direction, of, the, boat, under, sail, whereas, sails, operate, at, angles, of, attack, between, 10, and, 90, incident, to, the, wind, underwater, foils, operate, at, angles, of, attack, between, 0, and, 10, incident, to, the, water, passing, by, neither, their, angle, of, attack, nor, surface, is, adjustable, except, for, moveable, foils, and, they, are, never, intentionally, stalled, while, making, way, through, the, water, heeling, the, vessel, away, from, perpendicular, into, the, water, significantly, degrades, the, boat, s, ability, to, point, into, the, wind, hull, speed, is, the, speed, at, which, the, wavelength, of, a, vessel, s, bow, wave, is, equal, to, its, waterline, length, and, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, vessel, s, length, at, the, waterline, applying, more, power, does, not, significantly, increase, the, speed, of, a, displacement, vessel, beyond, hull, speed, this, is, because, the, vessel, is, climbing, up, an, increasingly, steep, bow, wave, with, the, addition, of, power, without, the, wave, propagating, forward, faster, planing, and, foiling, vessels, are, not, limited, by, hull, speed, as, they, rise, out, of, the, water, without, building, a, bow, wave, with, the, application, of, power, long, narrow, hulls, such, as, those, of, catamarans, surpass, hull, speed, by, piercing, through, the, bow, wave, hull, speed, does, not, apply, to, sailing, craft, on, ice, runners, or, wheels, because, they, do, not, displace, water
