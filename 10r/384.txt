ink, is, a, gel, sol, or, solution, that, contains, at, least, one, colorant, such, as, a, dye, or, pigment, and, is, used, to, color, a, surface, to, produce, an, image, text, or, design, ink, is, used, for, drawing, or, writing, with, a, pen, brush, reed, pen, or, quill, thicker, inks, in, paste, form, are, used, extensively, in, letterpress, and, lithographic, printing, ink, can, be, a, complex, medium, composed, of, solvents, pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate, matter, fluorescents, and, other, materials, the, components, of, inks, serve, many, purposes, the, ink, s, carrier, colorants, and, other, additives, affect, the, flow, and, thickness, of, the, ink, and, its, dry, appearance, many, ancient, cultures, around, the, world, have, independently, discovered, and, formulated, inks, due, to, the, need, to, write, and, draw, the, recipes, and, techniques, for, the, production, of, ink, are, derived, from, archaeological, analyses, or, from, written, texts, itself, the, earliest, inks, from, all, civilizations, are, believed, to, have, been, made, with, lampblack, a, kind, of, soot, easily, collected, as, a, by, product, of, fire, ink, was, used, in, ancient, egypt, for, writing, and, drawing, on, papyrus, from, at, least, the, 26th, century, bc, egyptian, red, and, black, inks, included, iron, and, ocher, as, pigments, in, addition, to, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, and, carboxylate, ions, with, lead, also, used, as, a, drier, the, earliest, chinese, inks, may, date, to, four, millennia, ago, to, the, chinese, neolithic, period, these, included, plant, animal, and, mineral, inks, based, on, such, materials, as, graphite, these, were, ground, with, water, and, applied, with, ink, brushes, direct, evidence, for, the, earliest, chinese, inks, similar, to, modern, inksticks, is, found, around, 256, bc, in, the, end, of, the, warring, states, period, being, produced, from, soot, and, animal, glue, the, preferred, inks, for, drawing, or, painting, on, paper, or, silk, are, produced, from, the, resin, of, the, pine, trees, between, 50, and, 100, years, old, the, chinese, inkstick, is, produced, with, a, fish, glue, whereas, japanese, glue, nikawa, is, from, cow, or, stag, india, ink, was, invented, in, china, though, materials, were, often, traded, from, india, hence, the, name, the, traditional, chinese, method, of, making, the, ink, was, to, grind, a, mixture, of, hide, glue, carbon, black, lampblack, and, bone, black, pigment, with, a, pestle, and, mortar, then, pour, it, into, a, ceramic, dish, to, dry, to, use, the, dry, mixture, a, wet, brush, would, be, applied, until, it, reliquified, the, manufacture, of, india, ink, was, well, established, by, the, cao, wei, dynasty, 220, 265, ad, indian, documents, written, in, kharosthi, with, ink, have, been, unearthed, in, xinjiang, the, practice, of, writing, with, ink, and, a, sharp, pointed, needle, was, common, in, early, south, india, several, buddhist, and, jain, sutras, in, india, were, compiled, in, ink, cephalopod, ink, known, as, sepia, turns, from, dark, blue, black, to, brown, on, drying, and, was, used, as, an, ink, in, the, graeco, roman, period, and, subsequently, black, atramentum, was, also, used, in, ancient, rome, in, an, article, for, the, christian, science, monitor, sharon, j, huntington, describes, these, other, historical, inks, about, 1, 600, years, ago, a, popular, ink, recipe, was, created, the, recipe, was, used, for, centuries, iron, salts, such, as, ferrous, sulfate, made, by, treating, iron, with, sulfuric, acid, were, mixed, with, tannin, from, gallnuts, they, grow, on, trees, and, a, thickener, when, first, put, to, paper, this, ink, is, bluish, black, over, time, it, fades, to, a, dull, brown, scribes, in, medieval, europe, about, ad, 800, to, 1500, wrote, principally, on, parchment, or, vellum, one, 12th, century, ink, recipe, called, for, hawthorn, branches, to, be, cut, in, the, spring, and, left, to, dry, then, the, bark, was, pounded, from, the, branches, and, soaked, in, water, for, eight, days, the, water, was, boiled, until, it, thickened, and, turned, black, wine, was, added, during, boiling, the, ink, was, poured, into, special, bags, and, hung, in, the, sun, once, dried, the, mixture, was, mixed, with, wine, and, iron, salt, over, a, fire, to, make, the, final, ink, the, reservoir, pen, which, may, have, been, the, first, fountain, pen, dates, back, to, 953, when, ma, d, al, mu, izz, the, caliph, of, egypt, demanded, a, pen, that, would, not, stain, his, hands, or, clothes, and, was, provided, with, a, pen, that, held, ink, in, a, reservoir, in, the, 15th, century, a, new, type, of, ink, had, to, be, developed, in, europe, for, the, printing, press, by, johannes, gutenberg, according, to, martyn, lyons, in, his, book, books, a, living, history, gutenberg, s, dye, was, indelible, oil, based, and, made, from, the, soot, of, lamps, lamp, black, mixed, with, varnish, and, egg, white, two, types, of, ink, were, prevalent, at, the, time, the, greek, and, roman, writing, ink, soot, glue, and, water, and, the, 12th, century, variety, composed, of, ferrous, sulfate, gall, gum, and, water, neither, of, these, handwriting, inks, could, adhere, to, printing, surfaces, without, creating, blurs, eventually, an, oily, varnish, like, ink, made, of, soot, turpentine, and, walnut, oil, was, created, specifically, for, the, printing, press, ink, formulas, vary, but, commonly, involve, two, components, inks, generally, fall, into, four, classes, pigment, inks, are, used, more, frequently, than, dyes, because, they, are, more, color, fast, but, they, are, also, more, expensive, less, consistent, in, color, and, have, less, of, a, color, range, than, dyes, pigments, are, solid, opaque, particles, suspended, in, ink, to, provide, color, pigment, molecules, typically, link, together, in, crystalline, structures, that, are, 0, 1, 2, m, in, size, and, comprise, 5, 30, percent, of, the, ink, volume, qualities, such, as, hue, saturation, and, lightness, vary, depending, on, the, source, and, type, of, pigment, dye, based, inks, are, generally, much, stronger, than, pigment, based, inks, and, can, produce, much, more, color, of, a, given, density, per, unit, of, mass, however, because, dyes, are, dissolved, in, the, liquid, phase, they, have, a, tendency, to, soak, into, paper, potentially, allowing, the, ink, to, bleed, at, the, edges, of, an, image, to, circumvent, this, problem, dye, based, inks, are, made, with, solvents, that, dry, rapidly, or, are, used, with, quick, drying, methods, of, printing, such, as, blowing, hot, air, on, the, fresh, print, other, methods, include, harder, paper, sizing, and, more, specialized, paper, coatings, the, latter, is, particularly, suited, to, inks, used, in, non, industrial, settings, which, must, conform, to, tighter, toxicity, and, emission, controls, such, as, inkjet, printer, inks, another, technique, involves, coating, the, paper, with, a, charged, coating, if, the, dye, has, the, opposite, charge, it, is, attracted, to, and, retained, by, this, coating, while, the, solvent, soaks, into, the, paper, cellulose, the, wood, derived, material, most, paper, is, made, of, is, naturally, charged, and, so, a, compound, that, complexes, with, both, the, dye, and, the, paper, s, surface, aids, retention, at, the, surface, such, a, compound, is, commonly, used, in, ink, jet, printing, inks, an, additional, advantage, of, dye, based, ink, systems, is, that, the, dye, molecules, can, interact, with, other, ink, ingredients, potentially, allowing, greater, benefit, as, compared, to, pigmented, inks, from, optical, brighteners, and, color, enhancing, agents, designed, to, increase, the, intensity, and, appearance, of, dyes, dye, based, inks, can, be, used, for, anti, counterfeit, purposes, and, can, be, found, in, some, gel, inks, fountain, pen, inks, and, inks, used, for, paper, currency, these, inks, react, with, cellulose, to, bring, about, a, permanent, color, change, dye, based, inks, are, used, to, color, hair, there, is, a, misconception, that, ink, is, non, toxic, even, if, swallowed, once, ingested, ink, can, be, hazardous, to, one, s, health, certain, inks, such, as, those, used, in, digital, printers, and, even, those, found, in, a, common, pen, can, be, harmful, though, ink, does, not, easily, cause, death, repeated, skin, contact, or, ingestion, can, cause, effects, such, as, severe, headaches, skin, irritation, or, nervous, system, damage, these, effects, can, be, caused, by, solvents, or, by, pigment, ingredients, such, as, p, anisidine, which, helps, create, some, inks, color, and, shine, three, main, environmental, issues, with, ink, are, some, regulatory, bodies, have, set, standards, for, the, amount, of, heavy, metals, in, ink, there, is, a, trend, toward, vegetable, oils, rather, than, petroleum, oils, in, recent, years, in, response, to, a, demand, for, better, environmental, sustainability, performance, ink, uses, up, non, renewable, oils, and, metals, which, has, a, negative, impact, on, the, environment, carbon, inks, were, commonly, made, from, lampblack, or, soot, and, a, binding, agent, such, as, gum, arabic, or, animal, glue, the, binding, agent, keeps, carbon, particles, in, suspension, and, adhered, to, paper, carbon, particles, do, not, fade, over, time, even, when, bleached, or, when, in, sunlight, one, benefit, is, that, carbon, ink, does, not, harm, paper, over, time, the, ink, is, chemically, stable, and, therefore, does, not, threaten, the, paper, s, strength, despite, these, benefits, carbon, ink, is, not, ideal, for, permanence, and, ease, of, preservation, carbon, ink, tends, to, smudge, in, humid, environments, and, can, be, washed, off, surfaces, the, best, method, of, preserving, a, document, written, in, carbon, ink, is, to, store, it, in, a, dry, environment, barrow, 1972, recently, carbon, inks, made, from, carbon, nanotubes, have, been, successfully, created, they, are, similar, in, composition, to, traditional, inks, in, that, they, use, a, polymer, to, suspend, the, carbon, nanotubes, these, inks, can, be, used, in, inkjet, printers, and, produce, electrically, conductive, patterns, iron, gall, inks, became, prominent, in, the, early, 12th, century, they, were, used, for, centuries, and, were, widely, thought, to, be, the, best, type, of, ink, however, iron, gall, ink, is, corrosive, and, damages, paper, over, time, waters, 1940, items, containing, this, ink, can, become, brittle, and, the, writing, fades, to, brown, the, original, scores, of, johann, sebastian, bach, are, threatened, by, the, destructive, properties, of, iron, gall, ink, the, majority, of, his, works, are, held, by, the, german, state, library, and, about, 25, of, those, are, in, advanced, stages, of, decay, american, libraries, 2000, the, rate, at, which, the, writing, fades, is, based, on, several, factors, such, as, proportions, of, ink, ingredients, amount, deposited, on, the, paper, and, paper, composition, barrow, 1972, 16, corrosion, is, caused, by, acid, catalyzed, hydrolysis, and, iron, ii, catalysed, oxidation, of, cellulose, rouchon, quillet, 2004, 389, treatment, is, a, controversial, subject, no, treatment, undoes, damage, already, caused, by, acidic, ink, deterioration, can, only, be, stopped, or, slowed, some, think, it, best, not, to, treat, the, item, at, all, for, fear, of, the, consequences, others, believe, that, non, aqueous, procedures, are, the, best, solution, yet, others, think, an, aqueous, procedure, may, preserve, items, written, with, iron, gall, ink, aqueous, treatments, include, distilled, water, at, different, temperatures, calcium, hydroxide, calcium, bicarbonate, magnesium, carbonate, magnesium, bicarbonate, and, calcium, hyphenate, there, are, many, possible, side, effects, from, these, treatments, there, can, be, mechanical, damage, which, further, weakens, the, paper, paper, color, or, ink, color, may, change, and, ink, may, bleed, other, consequences, of, aqueous, treatment, are, a, change, of, ink, texture, or, formation, of, plaque, on, the, surface, of, the, ink, reibland, de, groot, 1999, iron, gall, inks, require, storage, in, a, stable, environment, because, fluctuating, relative, humidity, increases, the, rate, that, formic, acid, acetic, acid, and, furan, derivatives, form, in, the, material, the, ink, was, used, on, sulfuric, acid, acts, as, a, catalyst, to, cellulose, hydrolysis, and, iron, ii, sulfate, acts, as, a, catalyst, to, cellulose, oxidation, these, chemical, reactions, physically, weaken, the, paper, causing, brittleness, indelible, means, un, removable, some, types, of, indelible, ink, have, a, very, short, shelf, life, because, of, the, quickly, evaporating, solvents, used, india, mexico, indonesia, malaysia, and, other, developing, countries, have, used, indelible, ink, in, the, form, of, electoral, stain, to, prevent, electoral, fraud, election, ink, based, on, silver, nitrate, was, first, applied, in, the, 1962, indian, general, election, after, being, developed, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, of, india, the, election, commission, in, india, has, used, indelible, ink, for, many, elections, indonesia, used, it, in, its, election, in, 2014, in, mali, the, ink, is, applied, to, the, fingernail, indelible, ink, itself, is, not, infallible, as, it, can, be, used, to, commit, electoral, fraud, by, marking, opponent, party, members, before, they, have, chances, to, cast, their, votes, there, are, also, reports, of, indelible, ink, washing, off, voters, fingers, in,
