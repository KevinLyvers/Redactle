electrification, is, the, process, of, powering, by, electricity, and, in, many, contexts, the, introduction, of, such, power, by, changing, over, from, an, earlier, power, source, in, the, context, of, history, of, technology, and, economic, development, electrification, refers, to, the, build, out, of, the, electricity, generation, and, electric, power, distribution, systems, in, the, context, of, sustainable, energy, electrification, refers, to, the, build, out, of, super, grids, with, energy, storage, to, accommodate, the, energy, transition, to, renewable, energy, and, the, switch, of, end, uses, to, electricity, the, electrification, of, particular, sectors, of, the, economy, particularly, out, of, context, is, called, by, modified, terms, such, as, factory, electrification, household, electrification, rural, electrification, and, railway, electrification, in, the, context, of, sustainable, energy, terms, such, as, transport, electrification, referring, to, electric, vehicles, or, heating, electrification, referring, to, heat, pumps, are, used, it, may, also, apply, to, changing, industrial, processes, such, as, smelting, melting, separating, or, refining, from, coal, or, coke, heating, or, to, chemical, processes, to, some, type, of, electric, process, such, as, electric, arc, furnace, electric, induction, or, resistance, heating, or, electrolysis, or, electrolytic, separating, electrification, was, called, the, greatest, engineering, achievement, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, national, academy, of, engineering, and, it, continues, in, both, rich, and, poor, countries, electric, lighting, is, highly, desirable, the, light, is, much, brighter, than, oil, or, gas, lamps, and, there, is, no, soot, although, early, electricity, was, very, expensive, compared, to, today, it, was, far, cheaper, and, more, convenient, than, oil, or, gas, lighting, electric, lighting, was, so, much, safer, than, oil, or, gas, that, some, companies, were, able, to, pay, for, the, electricity, with, the, insurance, savings, in, 1851, charles, babbage, stated, one, of, the, inventions, most, important, to, a, class, of, highly, skilled, workers, engineers, would, be, a, small, motive, power, ranging, perhaps, from, the, force, of, from, half, a, man, to, that, of, two, horses, which, might, commence, as, well, as, cease, its, action, at, a, moment, s, notice, require, no, expense, of, time, for, its, management, and, be, of, modest, cost, both, in, original, cost, and, in, daily, expense, to, be, efficient, steam, engines, needed, to, be, several, hundred, horsepower, steam, engines, and, boilers, also, required, operators, and, maintenance, for, these, reasons, the, smallest, commercial, steam, engines, were, about, 2, horsepower, this, was, above, the, need, for, many, small, shops, also, a, small, steam, engine, and, boiler, cost, about, 7, 000, while, an, old, blind, horse, that, could, develop, 1, 2, horsepower, cost, 20, or, less, machinery, to, use, horses, for, power, cost, 300, or, less, many, power, requirements, were, less, than, that, of, a, horse, shop, machines, such, as, woodworking, lathes, were, often, powered, with, a, one, or, two, man, crank, household, sewing, machines, were, powered, with, a, foot, treadle, however, factory, sewing, machines, were, steam, powered, from, a, line, shaft, dogs, were, sometimes, used, on, machines, such, as, a, treadmill, which, could, be, adapted, to, churn, butter, in, the, late, 19th, century, specially, designed, power, buildings, leased, space, to, small, shops, these, building, supplied, power, to, the, tenants, from, a, steam, engine, through, line, shafts, electric, motors, were, several, times, more, efficient, than, small, steam, engines, because, central, station, generation, was, more, efficient, than, small, steam, engines, and, because, line, shafts, and, belts, had, high, friction, losses, electric, motors, were, more, efficient, than, human, or, animal, power, the, conversion, efficiency, for, animal, feed, to, work, is, between, 4, and, 5, compared, to, over, 30, for, electricity, generated, using, coal, electrification, and, economic, growth, are, highly, correlated, in, economics, the, efficiency, of, electrical, generation, has, been, shown, to, correlate, with, technological, progress, in, the, u, s, from, 1870, to, 1880, each, man, hour, was, provided, with, 55, hp, in, 1950, each, man, hour, was, provided, with, 5, hp, or, a, 2, 8, annual, increase, declining, to, 1, 5, from, 1930, to, 1950, the, period, of, electrification, of, factories, and, households, from, 1900, to, 1940, was, one, of, high, productivity, and, economic, growth, most, studies, of, electrification, and, electric, grids, focused, on, industrial, core, countries, in, europe, and, the, united, states, elsewhere, wired, electricity, was, often, carried, on, and, through, the, circuits, of, colonial, rule, some, historians, and, sociologists, considered, the, interplay, of, colonial, politics, and, the, development, of, electric, grids, in, india, rao, showed, that, linguistics, based, regional, politics, not, techno, geographical, considerations, led, to, the, creation, of, two, separate, grids, in, colonial, zimbabwe, rhodesia, chikowero, showed, that, electrification, was, racially, based, and, served, the, white, settler, community, while, excluding, africans, and, in, mandate, palestine, shamir, claimed, that, british, electric, concessions, to, a, zionist, owned, company, deepened, the, economic, disparities, between, arabs, and, jews, while, electrification, of, cities, and, homes, has, existed, since, the, late, 19th, century, about, 840, million, people, mostly, in, africa, had, no, access, to, grid, electricity, in, 2017, down, from, 1, 2, billion, in, 2010, vast, gains, in, electrification, were, seen, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, from, 49, of, the, world, s, population, in, 1970, to, 76, in, 1990, by, the, early, 2010s, 81, 83, of, the, world, s, population, had, access, to, electricity, clean, energy, is, mostly, generated, in, the, form, of, electricity, such, as, renewable, energy, or, nuclear, power, switching, to, these, energy, sources, requires, that, end, uses, such, as, transport, and, heating, be, electrified, for, the, world, s, energy, systems, to, be, sustainable, in, the, u, s, and, canada, the, use, of, heat, pumps, hp, is, economic, if, powered, with, solar, photovoltaic, pv, devices, to, offset, propane, heating, in, rural, areas, and, natural, gas, heating, in, cities, a, 2023, study, investigated, 1, a, residential, natural, gas, based, heating, system, and, grid, electricity, 2, a, residential, natural, gas, based, heating, system, with, pv, to, serve, the, electric, load, 3, a, residential, hp, system, with, grid, electricity, and, 4, a, residential, hp, pv, system, it, found, that, under, typical, inflation, conditions, the, lifecycle, cost, of, natural, gas, and, reversible, air, source, heat, pumps, are, nearly, identical, which, in, part, explains, why, heat, pump, sales, have, surpassed, gas, furnace, sales, in, the, u, s, for, the, first, time, during, a, period, of, high, inflation, with, higher, rates, of, inflation, or, lower, pv, capital, costs, pv, becomes, a, hedge, against, rising, prices, and, encourages, the, adoption, of, heat, pumps, by, also, locking, in, both, electricity, and, heating, cost, growth, the, study, concludes, the, real, internal, rate, of, return, for, such, prosumer, technologies, is, 20x, greater, than, a, long, term, certificate, of, deposit, which, demonstrates, the, additional, value, pv, and, hp, technologies, offer, prosumers, over, comparably, secure, investment, vehicles, while, making, substantive, reductions, in, carbon, emissions, this, approach, can, be, improved, by, integrating, a, thermal, battery, into, the, heat, pump, solar, energy, heating, system, it, is, easier, to, sustainably, produce, electricity, than, it, is, to, sustainably, produce, liquid, fuels, therefore, adoption, of, electric, vehicles, is, a, way, to, make, transport, more, sustainable, hydrogen, vehicles, may, be, an, option, for, larger, vehicles, which, have, not, yet, been, widely, electrified, such, as, long, distance, lorries, while, electric, vehicle, technology, is, relatively, mature, in, road, transport, electric, shipping, and, aviation, are, still, early, in, their, development, hence, sustainable, liquid, fuels, may, have, a, larger, role, to, play, in, these, sectors, a, large, fraction, of, the, world, population, cannot, afford, sufficient, cooling, for, their, homes, in, addition, to, air, conditioning, which, requires, electrification, and, additional, power, demand, passive, building, design, and, urban, planning, will, be, needed, to, ensure, cooling, needs, are, met, in, a, sustainable, way, similarly, many, households, in, the, developing, and, developed, world, suffer, from, fuel, poverty, and, cannot, heat, their, houses, enough, existing, heating, practices, are, often, polluting, a, key, sustainable, solution, to, heating, is, electrification, heat, pumps, or, the, less, efficient, electric, heater, the, iea, estimates, that, heat, pumps, currently, provide, only, 5, of, space, and, water, heating, requirements, globally, but, could, provide, over, 90, use, of, ground, source, heat, pumps, not, only, reduces, total, annual, energy, loads, associated, with, heating, and, cooling, it, also, flattens, the, electric, demand, curve, by, eliminating, the, extreme, summer, peak, electric, supply, requirements, however, heat, pumps, and, resistive, heating, alone, will, not, be, sufficient, for, the, electrification, of, industrial, heat, this, because, in, several, processes, higher, temperatures, are, required, which, cannot, be, achieved, with, these, types, of, equipment, for, example, for, the, production, of, ethylene, via, steam, cracking, temperatures, as, high, as, 900, c, are, required, hence, drastically, new, processes, are, required, nevertheless, power, to, heat, is, expected, to, be, the, first, step, in, the, electrification, of, the, chemical, industry, with, an, expected, large, scale, implementation, by, 2025, some, cities, in, the, united, states, have, started, prohibiting, gas, hookups, for, new, houses, with, state, laws, passed, and, under, consideration, to, either, require, electrification, or, prohibit, local, requirements, the, uk, government, is, experimenting, with, electrification, for, home, heating, to, meet, its, climate, goals, ceramic, and, induction, heating, for, cooktops, as, well, as, industrial, applications, for, instance, steam, crackers, are, examples, of, technologies, that, can, be, used, to, transition, away, from, natural, gas, electricity, is, a, sticky, form, of, energy, in, that, it, tends, to, stay, in, the, continent, or, island, where, it, is, produced, it, is, also, multi, sourced, if, one, source, suffers, a, shortage, electricity, can, be, produced, from, other, sources, including, renewable, sources, as, a, result, in, the, long, term, it, is, a, relatively, resilient, means, of, energy, transmission, in, the, short, term, because, electricity, must, be, supplied, at, the, same, moment, it, is, consumed, it, is, somewhat, unstable, compared, to, fuels, that, can, be, delivered, and, stored, on, site, however, that, can, be, mitigated, by, grid, energy, storage, and, distributed, generation, solar, and, wind, are, variable, renewable, energy, sources, that, supply, electricity, intermittently, depending, on, the, weather, and, the, time, of, day, most, electrical, grids, were, constructed, for, non, intermittent, energy, sources, such, as, coal, fired, power, plants, as, larger, amounts, of, solar, and, wind, energy, are, integrated, into, the, grid, changes, have, to, be, made, to, the, energy, system, to, ensure, that, the, supply, of, electricity, is, matched, to, demand, in, 2019, these, sources, generated, 8, 5, of, worldwide, electricity, a, share, that, has, grown, rapidly, there, are, various, ways, to, make, the, electricity, system, more, flexible, in, many, places, wind, and, solar, production, are, complementary, on, a, daily, and, a, season, scale, there, is, more, wind, during, the, night, and, in, winter, when, solar, energy, production, is, low, linking, distant, geographical, regions, through, long, distance, transmission, lines, allows, for, further, cancelling, out, of, variability, energy, demand, can, be, shifted, in, time, through, energy, demand, management, and, the, use, of, smart, grids, matching, the, times, when, variable, energy, production, is, highest, with, storage, energy, produced, in, excess, can, be, released, when, needed, building, additional, capacity, for, wind, and, solar, generation, can, help, to, ensure, that, enough, electricity, is, produced, even, during, poor, weather, during, optimal, weather, energy, generation, may, have, to, be, curtailed, the, final, mismatch, may, be, covered, by, using, dispatchable, energy, sources, such, as, hydropower, bioenergy, or, natural, gas, energy, storage, helps, overcome, barriers, for, intermittent, renewable, energy, and, is, therefore, an, important, aspect, of, a, sustainable, energy, system, the, most, commonly, used, storage, method, is, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, which, requires, locations, with, large, differences, in, height, and, access, to, water, batteries, and, specifically, lithium, ion, batteries, are, also, deployed, widely, they, contain, cobalt, which, is, largely, mined, in, congo, a, politically, unstable, region, more, diverse, geographical, sourcing, may, ensure, the, stability, of, the, supply, chain, and, their, environmental, impacts, can, be, reduced, by, downcycling, and, recycling, batteries, typically, store, electricity, for, short, periods, research, is, ongoing, into, technology, with, sufficient, capacity, to, last, through, seasons, pumped, hydro, storage, and, power, to, gas, with, capacity, for, multi, month, usage, has, been, implemented, in, some, locations, as, of, 2018, thermal, energy, storage, is, typically, not, as, convenient, as, burning, fossil, fuels, high, upfront, costs, form, a, barrier, for, implementation, seasonal, thermal, energy, storage, requires, large, capacity, it, has, been, implemented, in, some, high, latitude, regions, for, household, heat, the, earliest, commercial, uses, of, electricity, were, electroplating, and, the, telegraph, in, the, years, 1831, 1832, michael, faraday, discovered, the, operating, principle, of, electromagnetic, generators, the, principle, later, called, faraday, s, law, is, based, on, an, electromotive, force, generated, in, an, electrical, conductor, that, is, subjected, to, a, varying, magnetic, flux, as, for, example, a, wire, moving, through, a, magnetic, field, faraday, built, the, first, electromagnetic, generator, called, the, faraday, disk, a, type, of, homopolar, generator, using, a, copper, disc, rotating, between, the, poles, of, a, horseshoe, magnet, faraday, s, first, electromagnetic, generator, produced, a, small, dc, voltage, around, 1832, hippolyte, pixii, improved, the, magneto, by, using, a, wire, wound, horseshoe, with, the, extra, coils, of, conductor, generating, more, current, but, it, was, ac, andr, marie, amp, re, suggested, a, means, of, converting, current, from, pixii, s, magneto, to, dc, using, a, rocking, switch, later, segmented, commutators, were, used, to, produce, direct, current, around, 1838, 40, william, fothergill, cooke, and, charles, wheatstone, developed, a, telegraph, in, 1840, wheatstone, was, using, a, magneto, that, he, developed, to, power, the, telegraph, wheatstone, and, cooke, made, an, important, improvement, in, electrical, generation, by, using, a, battery, powered, electromagnet, in, place, of, a, permanent, magnet, which, they, patented, in, 1845, the, self, excited, magnetic, field, dynamo, did, away, with, the, battery, to, power, electromagnets, this, type, of, dynamo, was, made, by, several, people, in, 1866, the, first, practical, generator, the, gramme, machine, was, made, by, z, t, gramme, who, sold, many, of, these, machines, in, the, 1870s, british, engineer, r, e, b, crompton, improved, the, generator, to, allow, better, air, cooling, and, made, other, mechanical, improvements, compound, winding, which, gave, more, stable, voltage, with, load, improved, the, operating, characteristics, of, generators, the, improvements, in, electrical, generation, technology, in, the, 19th, century, increased, its, efficiency, and, reliability, greatly, the, first, magnetos, only, converted, a, few, percent, of, mechanical, energy, to, electricity, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, highest, efficiencies, were, over, 90, sir, humphry, davy, invented, the, carbon, arc, lamp, in, 1802, upon, discovering, that, electricity, could, produce, a, light, arc, with, carbon, electrodes, however, it, was, not, used, to, any, great, extent, until, a, practical, means, of, generating, electricity, was, developed, carbon, arc, lamps, were, started, by, making, contact, between, two, carbon, electrodes, which, were, then, separated, to, within, a, narrow, gap, because, the, carbon, burned, away, the, gap, had, to, be, constantly, readjusted, several, mechanisms, were, developed, to, regulate, the, arc, a, common, approach, was, to, feed, a, carbon, electrode, by, gravity, and, maintain, the, gap, with, a, pair, of, electromagnets, one, of, which, retracted, the, upper, carbon, after, the, arc, was, started, and, the, second, controlled, a, brake, on, the, gravity, feed, arc, lamps, of, the, time, had, very, intense, light, output, in, the, range, of, 4, 000, candlepower, candelas, and, released, a, lot, of, heat, and, they, were, a, fire, hazard, all, of, which, made, them, inappropriate, for, lighting, homes, in, the, 1850s, many, of, these, problems, were, solved, by, the, arc, lamp, invented, by, william, petrie, and, william, staite, the, lamp, used, a, magneto, electric, generator, and, had, a, self, regulating, mechanism, to, control, the, gap, between, the, two, carbon, rods, their, light, was, used, to, light, up, the, national, gallery, in, london, and, was, a, great, novelty, at, the, time, these, arc, lamps, and, designs, similar, to, it, powered, by, large, magnetos, were, first, installed, on, english, lighthouses, in, the, mid, 1850s, but, the, technology, suffered, power, limitations, the, first, successful, arc, lamp, the, yablochkov, candle, was, developed, by, russian, engineer, pavel, yablochkov, using, the, gramme, generator, its, advantage, lay, in, the, fact, that, it, did, not, require, the, use, of, a, mechanical, regulator, like, its, predecessors, it, was, first, exhibited, at, the, paris, exposition, of, 1878, and, was, heavily, promoted, by, gramme, the, arc, light, was, installed, along, the, half, mile, length, of, avenue, de, l, op, ra, place, du, theatre, francais, and, around, the, place, de, l, op, ra, in, 1878, r, e, b, crompton, developed, a, more, sophisticated, design, in, 1878, which, gave, a, much, brighter, and, steadier, light, than, the, yablochkov, candle, in, 1878, he, formed, crompton, co, and, began, to, manufacture, sell, and, install, the, crompton, lamp, his, concern, was, one, of, the, first, electrical, engineering, firms, in, the, world, various, forms, of, incandescent, light, bulbs, had, numerous, inventors, however, the, most, successful, early, bulbs, were, those, that, used, a, carbon, filament, sealed, in, a, high, vacuum, these, were, invented, by, joseph, swan, in, 1878, in, britain, and, by, thomas, edison, in, 1879, in, the, us, edison, s, lamp, was, more, successful, than, swan, s, because, edison, used, a, thinner, filament, giving, it, higher, resistance, and, thus, conducting, much, less, current, edison, began, commercial, production, of, carbon, filament, bulbs, in, 1880, swan, s, light, began, commercial, production, in, 1881, swan, s, house, in, low, fell, gateshead, was, the, world, s, first, to, have, working, light, bulbs, installed, the, lit, phil, library, in, newcastle, was, the, first, public, room, lit, by, electric, light, and, the, savoy, theatre, was, the, first, public, building, in, the, world, lit, entirely, by, electricity, the, first, central, station, providing, public, power, is, believed, to, be, one, at, godalming, surrey, uk, in, autumn, 1881, the, system, was, proposed, after, the, town, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, on, the, rate, charged, by, the, gas, company, so, the, town, council, decided, to, use, electricity, the, system, lit, up, arc, lamps, on, the, main, streets, and, incandescent, lamps, on, a, few, side, streets, with, hydroelectric, power, by, 1882, between, 8, and, 10, households, were, connected, with, a, total, of, 57, lights, the, system, was, not, a, commercial, success, and, the, town, reverted, to, gas, the, first, large, scale, central, distribution, supply, plant, was, opened, at, holborn, viaduct, in, london, in, 1882, equipped, with, 1000, incandescent, lightbulbs, that, replaced, the, older, gas, lighting, the, station, lit, up, holborn, circus, including, the, offices, of, the, general, post, office, and, the, famous, city, temple, church, the, supply, was, a, direct, current, at, 110, v, due, to, power, loss, in, the, copper, wires, this, amounted, to, 100, v, for, the, customer, within, weeks, a, parliamentary, committee, recommended, passage, of, the, landmark, 1882, electric, lighting, act, which, allowed, the, licensing, of, persons, companies, or, local, authorities, to, supply, electricity, for, any, public, or, private, purposes, the, first, large, scale, central, power, station, in, america, was, edison, s, pearl, street, station, in, new, york, which, began, operating, in, september, 1882, the, station, had, six, 200, horsepower, edison, dynamos, each, powered, by, a, separate, steam, engine, it, was, located, in, a, business, and, commercial, district, and, supplied, 110, volt, direct, current, to, 85, customers, with, 400, lamps, by, 1884, pearl, street, was, supplying, 508, customers, with, 10, 164, lamps, by, the, mid, 1880s, other, electric, companies, were, establishing, central, power, stations, and, distributing, electricity, including, crompton, co, and, the, swan, electric, light, company, in, the, uk, thomson, houston, electric, company, and, westinghouse, in, the, us, and, siemens, in, germany, by, 1890, there, were, 1000, central, stations, in, operation, the, 1902, census, listed, 3, 620, central, stations, by, 1925, half, of, power, was, provided, by, central, stations, one, of, the, biggest, problems, facing, the, early, power, companies, was, the, hourly, variable, demand, when, lighting, was, practically, the, only, use, of, electricity, demand, was, high, during, the, first, hours, before, the, workday, and, the, evening, hours, when, demand, peaked, as, a, consequence, most, early, electric, companies, did, not, provide, daytime, service, with, two, thirds, providing, no, daytime, service, in, 1897, the, ratio, of, the, average, load, to, the, peak, load, of, a, central, station, is, called, the, load, factor, for, electric, companies, to, increase, profitability, and, lower, rates, it, was, necessary, to, increase, the, load, factor, the, way, this, was, eventually, accomplished, was, through, motor, load, motors, are, used, more, during, daytime, and, many, run, continuously, electric, street, railways, were, ideal, for, load, balancing, many, electric, railways, generated, their, own, power, and, also, sold, power, and, operated, distribution, systems, the, load, factor, adjusted, upward, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, at, pearl, street, the, load, factor, increased, from, 19, 3, in, 1884, to, 29, 4, in, 1908, by, 1929, the, load, factor, around, the, world, was, greater, than, 50, mainly, due, to, motor, load, before, widespread, power, distribution, from, central, stations, many, factories, large, hotels, apartment, and, office, buildings, had, their, own, power, generation, often, this, was, economically, attractive, because, the, exhaust, steam, could, be, used, for, building, and, industrial, process, heat, which, today, is, known, as, cogeneration, or, combined, heat, and, power, chp, most, self, generated, power, became, uneconomical, as, power, prices, fell, as, late, as, the, early, 20th, century, isolated, power, systems, greatly, outnumbered, central, stations, cogeneration, is, still, commonly, practiced, in, many, industries, that, use, large, amounts, of, both, steam, and, power, such, as, pulp, and, paper, chemicals, and, refining, the, continued, use, of, private, electric, generators, is, called, microgeneration, the, first, commutator, dc, electric, motor, capable, of, turning, machinery, was, invented, by, the, british, scientist, william, sturgeon, in, 1832, the, crucial, advance, that, this, represented, over, the, motor, demonstrated, by, michael, faraday, was, the, incorporation, of, a, commutator, this, allowed, sturgeon, s, motor, to, be, the, first, capable, of, providing, continuous, rotary, motion, frank, j, sprague, improved, on, the, dc, motor, in, 1884, by, solving, the, problem, of, maintaining, a, constant, speed, with, varying, load, and, reducing, sparking, from, the, brushes, sprague, sold, his, motor, through, edison, co, it, is, easy, to, vary, speed, with, dc, motors, which, made, them, suited, for, a, number, of, applications, such, as, electric, street, railways, machine, tools, and, certain, other, industrial, applications, where, speed, control, was, desirable, manufacturing, was, transitioned, from, line, shaft, and, belt, drive, using, steam, engines, and, water, power, to, electric, motors, although, the, first, power, stations, supplied, direct, current, the, distribution, of, alternating, current, soon, became, the, most, favored, option, the, main, advantages, of, ac, were, that, it, could, be, transformed, to, high, voltage, to, reduce, transmission, losses, and, that, ac, motors, could, easily, run, at, constant, speeds, alternating, current, technology, was, rooted, in, faraday, s, 1830, 31, discovery, that, a, changing, magnetic, field, can, induce, an, electric, current, in, a, circuit, the, first, person, to, conceive, of, a, rotating, magnetic, field, was, walter, baily, who, gave, a, workable, demonstration, of, his, battery, operated, polyphase, motor, aided, by, a, commutator, on, june, 28, 1879, to, the, physical, society, of, london, nearly, identical, to, baily, s, apparatus, french, electrical, engineer, marcel, deprez, in, 1880, published, a, paper, that, identified, the, rotating, magnetic, field, principle, and, that, of, a, two, phase, ac, system, of, currents, to, produce, it, in, 1886, english, engineer, elihu, thomson, built, an, ac, motor, by, expanding, upon, the, induction, repulsion, principle, and, his, wattmeter, it, was, in, the, 1880s, that, the, technology, was, commercially, developed, for, large, scale, electricity, generation, and, transmission, in, 1882, the, british, inventor, and, electrical, engineer, sebastian, de, ferranti, working, for, the, company, siemens, collaborated, with, the, distinguished, physicist, lord, kelvin, to, pioneer, ac, power, technology, including, an, early, transformer, a, power, transformer, developed, by, lucien, gaulard, and, john, dixon, gibbs, was, demonstrated, in, london, in, 1881, and, attracted, the, interest, of, westinghouse, they, also, exhibited, the, invention, in, turin, in, 1884, where, it, was, adopted, for, an, electric, lighting, system, many, of, their, designs, were, adapted, to, the, particular, laws, governing, electrical, distribution, in, the, uk, sebastian, ziani, de, ferranti, went, into, this, business, in, 1882, when, he, set, up, a, shop, in, london, designing, various, electrical, devices, ferranti, believed, in, the, success, of, alternating, current, power, distribution, early, on, and, was, one, of, the, few, experts, in, this, system, in, the, uk, with, the, help, of, lord, kelvin, ferranti, pioneered, the, first, ac, power, generator, and, transformer, in, 1882, john, hopkinson, a, british, physicist, invented, the, three, wire, three, phase, system, for, the, distribution, of, electrical, power, for, which, he, was, granted, a, patent, in, 1882, the, italian, inventor, galileo, ferraris, invented, a, polyphase, ac, induction, motor, in, 1885, the, idea, was, that, two, out, of, phase, but, synchronized, currents, might, be, used, to, produce, two, magnetic, fields, that, could, be, combined, to, produce, a, rotating, field, without, any, need, for, switching, or, for, moving, parts, other, inventors, were, the, american, engineers, charles, s, bradley, and, nikola, tesla, and, the, german, technician, friedrich, august, haselwander, they, were, able, to, overcome, the, problem, of, starting, up, the, ac, motor, by, using, a, rotating, magnetic, field, produced, by, a, poly, phase, current, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, introduced, the, first, three, phase, induction, motor, in, 1890, a, much, more, capable, design, that, became, the, prototype, used, in, europe, and, the, u, s, by, 1895, ge, and, westinghouse, both, had, ac, motors, on, the, market, with, single, phase, current, either, a, capacitor, or, coil, creating, inductance, can, be, used, on, part, of, the, circuit, inside, the, motor, to, create, a, rotating, magnetic, field, multi, speed, ac, motors, that, have, separately, wired, poles, have, long, been, available, the, most, common, being, two, speed, speed, of, these, motors, is, changed, by, switching, sets, of, poles, on, or, off, which, was, done, with, a, special, motor, starter, for, larger, motors, or, a, simple, multiple, speed, switch, for, fractional, horsepower, motors, the, first, ac, power, station, was, built, by, the, english, electrical, engineer, sebastian, de, ferranti, in, 1887, the, london, electric, supply, corporation, hired, ferranti, for, the, design, of, their, power, station, at, deptford, he, designed, the, building, the, generating, plant, and, the, distribution, system, it, was, built, at, the, stowage, a, site, to, the, west, of, the, mouth, of, deptford, creek, once, used, by, the, east, india, company, built, on, an, unprecedented, scale, and, pioneering, the, use, of, high, voltage, 10, 000, v, ac, current, it, generated, 800, kilowatts, and, supplied, central, london, on, its, completion, in, 1891, it, was, the, first, truly, modern, power, station, supplying, high, voltage, ac, power, that, was, then, stepped, down, with, transformers, for, consumer, use, on, each, street, this, basic, system, remains, in, use, today, around, the, world, in, the, u, s, george, westinghouse, who, had, become, interested, in, the, power, transformer, developed, by, gaulard, and, gibbs, began, to, develop, his, ac, lighting, system, using, a, transmission, system, with, a, 20, 1, step, up, voltage, with, step, down, in, 1890, westinghouse, and, stanley, built, a, system, to, transmit, power, several, miles, to, a, mine, in, colorado, a, decision, was, taken, to, use, ac, for, power, transmission, from, the, niagara, power, project, to, buffalo, new, york, proposals, submitted, by, vendors, in, 1890, included, dc, and, compressed, air, systems, a, combination, dc, and, compressed, air, system, remained, under, consideration, until, late, in, the, schedule, despite, the, protestations, of, the, niagara, commissioner, william, thomson, lord, kelvin, the, decision, was, taken, to, build, an, ac, system, which, had, been, proposed, by, both, westinghouse, and, general, electric, in, october, 1893, westinghouse, was, awarded, the, contract, to, provide, the, first, three, 5, 000, hp, 250, rpm, 25, hz, two, phase, generators, the, hydro, power, plant, went, online, in, 1895, and, it, was, the, largest, one, until, that, date, by, the, 1890s, single, and, poly, phase, ac, was, undergoing, rapid, introduction, in, the, u, s, by, 1902, 61, of, generating, capacity, was, ac, increasing, to, 95, in, 1917, despite, the, superiority, of, alternating, current, for, most, applications, a, few, existing, dc, systems, continued, to, operate, for, several, decades, after, ac, became, the, standard, for, new, systems, the, efficiency, of, steam, prime, movers, in, converting, the, heat, energy, of, fuel, into, mechanical, work, was, a, critical, factor, in, the, economic, operation, of, steam, central, generating, stations, early, projects, used, reciprocating, steam, engines, operating, at, relatively, low, speeds, the, introduction, of, the, steam, turbine, fundamentally, changed, the, economics, of, central, station, operations, steam, turbines, could, be, made, in, larger, ratings, than, reciprocating, engines, and, generally, had, higher, efficiency, the, speed, of, steam, turbines, did, not, fluctuate, cyclically, during, each, revolution, this, made, parallel, operation, of, ac, generators, feasible, and, improved, the, stability, of, rotary, converters, for, production, of, direct, current, for, traction, and, industrial, uses, steam, turbines, ran, at, higher, speed, than, reciprocating, engines, not, being, limited, by, the, allowable, speed, of, a, piston, in, a, cylinder, this, made, them, more, compatible, with, ac, generators, with, only, two, or, four, poles, no, gearbox, or, belted, speed, increaser, was, needed, between, the, engine, and, the, generator, it, was, costly, and, ultimately, impossible, to, provide, a, belt, drive, between, a, low, speed, engine, and, a, high, speed, generator, in, the, very, large, ratings, required, for, central, station, service, the, modern, steam, turbine, was, invented, in, 1884, by, british, engineer, sir, charles, parsons, whose, first, model, was, connected, to, a, dynamo, that, generated, 7, 5, kw, 10, hp, of, electricity, the, invention, of, parsons, s, steam, turbine, made, cheap, and, plentiful, electricity, possible, parsons, turbines, were, widely, introduced, in, english, central, stations, by, 1894, the, first, electric, supply, company, in, the, world, to, generate, electricity, using, turbo, generators, was, parsons, s, own, electricity, supply, company, newcastle, and, district, electric, lighting, company, set, up, in, 1894, within, parsons, s, lifetime, the, generating, capacity, of, a, unit, was, scaled, up, by, about, 10, 000, times, the, first, u, s, turbines, were, two, de, leval, units, at, edison, co, in, new, york, in, 1895, the, first, u, s, parsons, turbine, was, at, westinghouse, air, brake, co, near, pittsburgh, steam, turbines, also, had, capital, cost, and, operating, advantages, over, reciprocating, engines, the, condensate, from, steam, engines, was, contaminated, with, oil, and, could, not, be, reused, while, condensate, from, a, turbine, is, clean, and, typically, reused, steam, turbines, were, a, fraction, of, the, size, and, weight, of, comparably, rated, reciprocating, steam, engine, steam, turbines, can, operate, for, years, with, almost, no, wear, reciprocating, steam, engines, required, high, maintenance, steam, turbines, can, be, manufactured, with, capacities, far, larger, than, any, steam, engines, ever, made, giving, important, economies, of, scale, steam, turbines, could, be, built, to, operate, on, higher, pressure, and, temperature, steam, a, fundamental, principle, of, thermodynamics, is, that, the, higher, the, temperature, of, the, steam, entering, an, engine, the, higher, the, efficiency, the, introduction, of, steam, turbines, motivated, a, series, of, improvements, in, temperatures, and, pressures, the, resulting, increased, conversion, efficiency, lowered, electricity, prices, the, power, density, of, boilers, was, increased, by, using, forced, combustion, air, and, by, using, compressed, air, to, feed, pulverized, coal, also, coal, handling, was, mechanized, and, automated, with, the, realization, of, long, distance, power, transmission, it, was, possible, to, interconnect, different, central, stations, to, balance, loads, and, improve, load, factors, interconnection, became, increasingly, desirable, as, electrification, grew, rapidly, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, charles, merz, of, the, merz, mclellan, consulting, partnership, built, the, neptune, bank, power, station, near, newcastle, upon, tyne, in, 1901, and, by, 1912, had, developed, into, the, largest, integrated, power, system, in, europe, in, 1905, he, tried, to, influence, parliament, to, unify, the, variety, of, voltages, and, frequencies, in, the, country, s, electricity, supply, industry, but, it, was, not, until, world, war, i, that, parliament, began, to, take, this, idea, seriously, appointing, him, head, of, a, parliamentary, committee, to, address, the, problem, in, 1916, merz, pointed, out, that, the, uk, could, use, its, small, size, to, its, advantage, by, creating, a, dense, distribution, grid, to, feed, its, industries, efficiently, his, findings, led, to, the, williamson, report, of, 1918, which, in, turn, created, the, electricity, supply, bill, of, 1919, the, bill, was, the, first, step, towards, an, integrated, electricity, system, in, the, uk, the, more, significant, electricity, supply, act, of, 1926, led, to, the, setting, up, of, the, national, grid, the, central, electricity, board, standardised, the, nation, s, electricity, supply, and, established, the, first, synchronised, ac, grid, running, at, 132, kilovolts, and, 50, hertz, this, started, operating, as, a, national, system, the, national, grid, in, 1938, in, the, united, states, it, became, a, national, objective, after, the, power, crisis, during, the, summer, of, 1918, in, the, midst, of, world, war, i, to, consolidate, supply, in, 1934, the, public, utility, holding, company, act, recognized, electric, utilities, as, public, goods, of, importance, along, with, gas, water, and, telephone, companies, and, thereby, were, given, outlined, restrictions, and, regulatory, oversight, of, their, operations, the, electrification, of, households, in, europe, and, north, america, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, major, cities, and, in, areas, served, by, electric, railways, and, increased, rapidly, until, about, 1930, when, 70, of, households, were, electrified, in, the, u, s, rural, areas, were, electrified, first, in, europe, and, in, the, u, s, the, rural, electric, administration, established, in, 1935, brought, electrification, to, the, underserviced, rural, areas, in, the, soviet, union, as, in, the, united, states, rural, electrification, progressed, more, slowly, than, in, urban, areas, it, wasn, t, until, the, brezhnev, era, that, electrification, became, widespread, in, rural, regions, with, the, soviet, rural, electrification, drive, largely, completed, by, the, early, 1970s, in, china, the, turmoil, of, the, warlord, era, the, civil, war, and, the, japanese, invasion, in, the, early, 20th, century, delayed, electrification, for, decades, it, was, only, after, the, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, that, the, country, was, positioned, to, pursue, widespread, electrification, during, the, mao, years, while, electricity, became, commonplace, in, cities, rural, areas, were, largely, neglected, at, the, time, of, mao, s, death, in, 1976, 25, of, chinese, households, still, lacked, access, to, electricity, deng, xiaoping, who, became, china, s, paramount, leader, in, 1978, initiated, a, rural, electrification, drive, as, part, of, a, broader, modernization, effort, by, the, late, 1990s, electricity, had, become, ubiquitious, in, regional, areas, the, very, last, remote, villages, in, china, were, connected, to, the, grid, in, 2015, central, station, electric, power, generating, provided, power, more, efficiently, and, at, lower, cost, than, small, generators, the, capital, and, operating, cost, per, unit, of, power, were, also, cheaper, with, central, stations, the, cost, of, electricity, fell, dramatically, in, the, first, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, due, to, the, introduction, of, steam, turbines, and, the, improved, load, factor, after, the, introduction, of, ac, motors, as, electricity, prices, fell, usage, increased, dramatically, and, central, stations, were, scaled, up, to, enormous, sizes, creating, significant, economies, of, scale, for, the, historical, cost, see, ayres, warr, 2002, fig, 7
