from, the, micro, scale, showcasing, the, most, intimate, spaces, of, the, individual, dwelling, and, direct, surrounding, area, to, the, macro, scale, of, the, geographic, area, such, as, town, village, city, country, or, planet, the, concept, of, home, has, been, researched, and, theorized, across, disciplines, topics, ranging, from, the, idea, of, home, the, interior, the, psyche, liminal,

population, lives, and, works, the, concept, and, experience, encompasses, the, likes, of, exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness, and, homelessness, the, earliest, homes, that, humans, inhabited, were, likely, naturally, occurring, features, such, as, caves, the, earliest, human, fossils, found, in, caves, come, from, a, series, of, caves, near, krugersdorp, and, mokopane, in, south, africa, the, cave, sites, of, sterkfontein, swartkrans, kromdraai, b, drimolen, malapa, cooper, s, d, gladysvale, gondolin, and, makapansgat, have, yielded, a, range, of, early, human, species, dating, back, to, between, three, and, one, million, years, ago, including, australopithecus, africanus, australopithecus, sediba, and, paranthropus, robustus, however, it, is, not, generally, thought, that, these, early, humans, were, living, in, the, caves, but, that, they, were, brought, into, the, caves, by, carnivores, that, had, killed, them, the, first, early, hominid, ever, found, in, africa, the, taung, child, in, 1924, was, also, thought, for, many, years, to, come, from, a, cave, where, it, had, been, deposited, after, being, preyed, upon, by, an, eagle, however, this, is, now, debated, caves, do, form, in, the, dolomite, of, the, ghaap, plateau, including, the, early, middle, and, later, stone, age, site, of, wonderwerk, cave, however, the, caves, that, form, along, the, escarpment, s, edge, like, that, hypothesized, for, the, taung, child, are, formed, within, a, secondary, limestone, deposit, called, tufa, there, is, numerous, evidence, for, other, early, human, species, inhabiting, caves, from, at, least, one, million, years, ago, in, different, parts, of, the, world, including, homo, erectus, in, china, at, zhoukoudian, homo, rhodesiensis, in, south, africa, at, the, cave, of, hearths, makapansgat, homo, neanderthalensis, and, homo, heidelbergensis, in, europe, at, archaeological, site, of, atapuerca, homo, floresiensis, in, indonesia, and, the, denisovans, in, southern, siberia, in, southern, africa, early, modern, humans, regularly, used, sea, caves, as, shelter, starting, about, 180, 000, years, ago, when, they, learned, to, exploit, the, sea, for, the, first, time, the, oldest, known, site, is, pp13b, at, pinnacle, point, this, may, have, allowed, rapid, expansion, of, humans, out, of, africa, and, colonization, of, areas, of, the, world, such, as, australia, by, 60, 50, 000, years, ago, throughout, southern, africa, australia, and, europe, early, modern, humans, used, caves, and, rock, shelters, as, sites, for, rock, art, such, as, those, at, giants, castle, caves, such, as, the, yaodong, in, china, were, used, for, shelter, other, caves, were, used, for, burials, such, as, rock, cut, tombs, or, as, religious, sites, such, as, buddhist, caves, among, the, known, sacred, caves, are, china, s, cave, of, a, thousand, buddhas, and, the, sacred, caves, of, crete, as, technology, progressed, humans, and, other, hominids, began, constructing, their, own, dwellings, buildings, such, as, huts, and, longhouses, have, been, used, for, living, since, the, late, neolithic, from, the, 14th, to, the, 16th, century, homelessness, was, perceived, of, as, a, vagrancy, problem, and, legislative, responses, to, the, problem, were, predicated, upon, the, threat, it, may, pose, to, the, state, according, to, kirsten, gram, hanssen, it, can, be, argued, that, historically, and, cross, culturally, there, is, not, always, strong, relation, between, the, concept, of, home, and, the, physical, building, and, that, this, mode, of, thinking, is, rooted, in, the, enlightenment, of, the, seventeenth, century, before, one, s, home, was, more, public, than, private, traits, such, as, privacy, intimacy, and, familiarity, would, proceed, to, achieve, greater, prominence, aligning, the, concept, with, the, bourgeoisie, the, connection, between, home, and, house, was, reinforced, by, a, case, law, declaration, from, edward, coke, the, house, of, everyman, is, to, him, as, his, castle, and, fortress, as, well, as, his, defense, against, injury, and, violence, as, for, his, repose, colloquially, this, was, adapted, into, the, phrase, the, englishman, s, home, is, his, castle, which, popularised, the, notion, of, home, as, house, a, result, of, the, longstanding, association, between, home, and, women, 18th, century, english, women, of, upper, class, status, were, scorned, for, pursuing, activities, outside, of, the, home, thus, seen, to, be, of, undesirable, character, the, concept, of, home, took, on, unprecedent, prominence, by, the, 18th, century, reified, by, cultural, practice, the, concept, of, a, smart, home, arose, in, the, 19th, century, in, turn, with, electricity, having, been,

history, and, identity, people, of, differing, ages, genders, ethnicities, and, classes, may, have, resultingly, different, meanings, of, home, commonly, it, is, associated, with, various, forms, of,

or, fixed, though, the, boundaries, of, home, are, often, tied, to, the, space, there, have, been, multiple, theories, regarding, one, s, choice, of, home, with, the, residential, conditions, of,

homelessness, in, a, sense, without, homelessness, we, would, not, be, concerned, with, what, home, means, the, connection, between, humans, and, dwelling, is, profound, such, that, the, likes, of, gaston, bachelard, and, martin, heidegger, consider, it, an, essential, characteristic, of, humanity, a, home, is, generally, a, place, that, is, close, to, the, heart, of, the, owner, and, can, become, a, prized, possession, it, has, been, argued, that, psychologically, the, strongest, sense, of, home, commonly, coincides, geographically, with, a, dwelling, usually, the, sense, of, home,

exists, as, to, if, a, rooming, house, can, provide, a, home, some, housing, scholars, have, contended, that, a, conflation, of, house, and, home, is, the, result, of, popular, media, and, capitalist, interest, differing, cultures, may, perceive, the, concept, of, a, home, differently, ascribing, less, value, to, the, privacy, of, a, residence, or, the, residence, itself, although, housing, issues, have, been, seen, as, of, great, concern, to, immigrants, the, home, can, render, to, men, and, women, in, significant, differences, men, conditioned, to, experience, great, control, and, little, labour, and, vice, versa, for, women, homelessness, too, can, be, subject, to, differences, per, gender, sociologist, shelley, mallett, preposed, the, idea, of, home, as, abstractions, space, feeling, praxis, or, a, way, of, being, in, the, world, abstract, notions, of, home, are, present, in, the, proverb, a, house, is, not, a, home, since, it, can, be, said, that, humans, are, generally,

insinuating, the, home, to, be, the, domain, of, women, to, be, homesick, is, to, desire, belonging, said, zygmunt, bauman, places, like, homes, can, trigger, self, reflection, thoughts, about, who, someone, is, or, used, to, be, or, who, they, might, become, these, types, of, reflections, also, occur, in, places, where, there, is, a, collective, historical, identity, such, as, gettysburg, or, ground, zero, the, time, spent, with, one, s, home, is, a, considerable, element, in, establishing, one, s, attachment, those, without, significant, time, spent, of, their, life, in, a, residence, often, struggle, to, consider, home, as, a, feature, of, residences, the, perception, of, one, s, home, can, extend, beyond, the, residence, itself, to, their, neighbourhood, family, workplace, or, nation, and, one, may, feel, as, though, they, have, multiple, homes, to, have, felt, at, home, beyond, residence, can, be, a, significant, element, in, one, s, appraisal, of, their, life, a, time, in, which, notions, of, home, it, has, been, observed, are, more, profound, the, connection, between, home, and, family, is, pertinent, to, the, extent, that, some, scholars, consider, the, terms, to, be, synonymous
