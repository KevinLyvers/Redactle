an, igloo, inuit, languages, iglu, inuktitut, syllabics, plural, igluit, also, known, as, a, snow, house, or, snow, hut, is, a, type, of, shelter, built, of, suitable, snow, although, igloos, are, often, associated, with, all, inuit, they, were, traditionally, used, only, by, the, people, of, canada, s, central, arctic, and, the, qaanaaq, area, of, greenland, other, inuit, tended, to, use, snow, to, insulate, their, houses, which, were, constructed, from, whalebone, and, hides, snow, is, used, because, the, air, pockets, trapped, in, it, make, it, an, insulator, on, the, outside, temperatures, may, be, as, low, as, 45, c, 49, f, but, on, the, inside, the, temperature, may, range, from, 7, to, 16, c, 19, to, 61, f, when, warmed, by, body, heat, alone, in, the, inuit, languages, the, word, iglu, plural, igluit, can, be, used, for, a, house, or, home, built, of, any, material, the, word, is, not, restricted, exclusively, to, snowhouses, called, specifically, igluvijaq, plural, igluvijait, but, includes, traditional, tents, sod, houses, homes, constructed, of, driftwood, and, modern, buildings, outside, inuit, culture, however, igloo, refers, exclusively, to, shelters, constructed, from, blocks, of, compacted, snow, generally, in, the, form, of, a, dome, several, inuit, language, dialects, throughout, the, canadian, arctic, siglitun, inuinnaqtun, natsilingmiutut, kivalliq, north, baffin, use, iglu, for, all, buildings, including, snowhouses, and, it, is, the, term, used, by, the, government, of, nunavut, an, exception, to, this, is, the, dialect, used, in, the, igloolik, region, of, nunavut, iglu, is, used, for, other, buildings, while, igluvijaq, plural, igluvijait, inuktitut, syllabics, is, specifically, used, for, a, snowhouse, there, are, three, traditional, types, of, igloos, each, has, a, different, size, from, small, to, large, and, is, used, for, a, different, purpose, the, smallest, sized, igloos, are, constructed, as, temporary, shelters, they, are, usually, used, for, one, or, two, nights, and, therefore, are, easier, to, build, on, rare, occasions, these, small, types, of, igloos, are, used, during, hunting, trips, which, are, often, on, open, sea, ice, intermediate, sized, igloos, were, for, semi, permanent, family, dwelling, this, was, usually, a, single, room, dwelling, that, housed, one, or, two, families, often, there, were, several, of, these, in, a, small, area, which, formed, an, inuit, village, the, largest, sized, igloos, were, normally, built, in, groups, of, two, one, of, the, buildings, was, a, temporary, structure, built, for, special, occasions, while, the, other, one, was, built, nearby, for, living, these, large, igloos, could, have, up, to, five, rooms, and, house, 20, people, a, large, igloo, could, be, constructed, from, several, smaller, igloos, attached, by, their, tunnels, giving, common, access, to, the, outside, these, large, igloos, were, used, to, hold, community, feasts, and, traditional, dances, snow, igloos, are, not, spherical, but, are, built, in, a, catenary, a, curved, shape, more, closely, resembling, a, paraboloid, using, this, shape, the, stresses, of, snow, as, it, ages, and, compresses, are, less, likely, to, cause, it, to, buckle, because, in, an, inverted, paraboloid, or, catenoid, the, pressures, are, nearer, to, being, exclusively, compressive, the, individual, snow, bricks, are, cut, out, of, the, ground, with, saws, and, machete, like, blades, they, are, originally, cut, out, in, a, four, sided, shape, however, later, the, snow, bricks, are, often, cut, into, five, or, six, sided, shapes, to, increase, structural, interlocking, similar, to, the, stones, used, in, the, architecture, of, the, inca, empire, igloos, gradually, become, shorter, with, time, due, to, the, compressive, creep, of, the, snow, the, snow, used, to, build, an, igloo, must, have, enough, structural, strength, to, be, cut, and, stacked, appropriately, the, best, snow, to, use, for, this, purpose, is, snow, which, has, been, blown, by, wind, which, can, serve, to, compact, and, interlock, the, ice, crystals, snow, that, has, settled, gently, to, the, ground, in, still, weather, is, not, useful, the, hole, left, in, the, snow, where, the, blocks, are, cut, is, usually, used, as, the, lower, half, of, the, shelter, snow, s, insulating, properties, enable, the, inside, of, the, igloo, to, remain, relatively, warm, in, some, cases, a, single, block, of, clear, freshwater, ice, is, inserted, to, allow, light, into, the, igloo, igloos, used, as, winter, shelters, had, beds, made, of, loose, snow, skins, and, caribou, furs, sometimes, a, short, tunnel, is, constructed, at, the, entrance, to, reduce, wind, and, heat, loss, when, the, door, is, opened, animal, skins, or, a, snow, block, can, be, used, as, a, door, the, igloo, is, architecturally, unique, in, that, it, is, a, dome, that, can, be, raised, out, of, independent, blocks, leaning, on, each, other, and, polished, to, fit, without, an, additional, supporting, structure, during, construction, an, igloo, that, is, built, correctly, will, support, the, weight, of, a, person, standing, on, the, roof, traditionally, an, igloo, might, be, deliberately, consolidated, immediately, after, construction, by, making, a, large, flame, with, a, kudlik, qulliq, stone, lamp, briefly, making, the, interior, very, hot, which, causes, the, walls, to, melt, slightly, and, settle, body, heat, is, also, adequate, although, slower, this, melting, and, refreezing, builds, up, a, layer, of, ice, that, contributes, to, the, strength, of, the, igloo, the, sleeping, platform, is, a, raised, area, with, warmer, air, rising, and, cooler, air, settling, the, entrance, area, acts, as, a, cold, trap, whereas, the, sleeping, area, will, hold, whatever, heat, is, generated, by, a, stove, lamp, body, heat, or, other, device, the, central, inuit, especially, those, around, the, davis, strait, lined, the, living, area, with, skin, which, could, increase, the, temperature, within, from, around, 2, c, 36, f, to, 10, 20, c, 50, 68, f
