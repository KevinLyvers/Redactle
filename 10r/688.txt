a, locomotive, is, a, rail, transport, vehicle, that, provides, the, motive, power, for, a, train, if, a, locomotive, is, capable, of, carrying, a, payload, it, is, usually, rather, referred, to, as, a, multiple, unit, motor, coach, railcar, or, power, car, the, use, of, these, self, propelled, vehicles, is, increasingly, common, for, passenger, trains, but, rare, for, freight, trains, traditionally, locomotives, pulled, trains, from, the, front, however, push, pull, operation, has, become, common, where, the, train, may, have, a, locomotive, or, locomotives, at, the, front, at, the, rear, or, at, each, end, most, recently, railroads, have, begun, adopting, dpu, or, distributed, power, the, front, may, have, one, or, two, locomotives, followed, by, a, mid, train, locomotive, that, is, controlled, remotely, from, the, lead, unit, the, word, locomotive, originates, from, the, latin, loco, from, a, place, ablative, of, locus, place, and, the, medieval, latin, motivus, causing, motion, and, is, a, shortened, form, of, the, term, locomotive, engine, which, was, first, used, in, 1814, to, distinguish, between, self, propelled, and, stationary, steam, engines, prior, to, locomotives, the, motive, force, for, railways, had, been, generated, by, various, lower, technology, methods, such, as, human, power, horse, power, gravity, or, stationary, engines, that, drove, cable, systems, few, such, systems, are, still, in, existence, today, locomotives, may, generate, their, power, from, fuel, wood, coal, petroleum, or, natural, gas, or, they, may, take, power, from, an, outside, source, of, electricity, it, is, common, to, classify, locomotives, by, their, source, of, energy, the, common, ones, include, a, steam, locomotive, is, a, locomotive, whose, primary, power, source, is, a, steam, engine, the, most, common, form, of, steam, locomotive, also, contains, a, boiler, to, generate, the, steam, used, by, the, engine, the, water, in, the, boiler, is, heated, by, burning, combustible, material, usually, coal, wood, or, oil, to, produce, steam, the, steam, moves, reciprocating, pistons, which, are, connected, to, the, locomotive, s, main, wheels, known, as, the, driving, wheels, both, fuel, and, water, supplies, are, carried, with, the, locomotive, either, on, the, locomotive, itself, in, bunkers, and, tanks, this, arrangement, is, known, as, a, tank, locomotive, or, pulled, behind, the, locomotive, in, tenders, this, arrangement, is, known, as, a, tender, locomotive, the, first, full, scale, working, railway, steam, locomotive, was, built, by, richard, trevithick, in, 1802, it, was, constructed, for, the, coalbrookdale, ironworks, in, shropshire, in, england, though, no, record, of, it, working, there, has, survived, on, 21, february, 1804, the, first, recorded, steam, hauled, railway, journey, took, place, as, another, of, trevithick, s, locomotives, hauled, a, train, from, the, penydarren, ironworks, in, merthyr, tydfil, to, abercynon, in, south, wales, accompanied, by, andrew, vivian, it, ran, with, mixed, success, the, design, incorporated, a, number, of, important, innovations, including, the, use, of, high, pressure, steam, which, reduced, the, weight, of, the, engine, and, increased, its, efficiency, in, 1812, matthew, murray, s, twin, cylinder, rack, locomotive, salamanca, first, ran, on, the, edge, railed, rack, and, pinion, middleton, railway, this, is, generally, regarded, as, the, first, commercially, successful, locomotive, another, well, known, early, locomotive, was, puffing, billy, built, 1813, 14, by, engineer, william, hedley, for, the, wylam, colliery, near, newcastle, upon, tyne, this, locomotive, is, the, oldest, preserved, and, is, on, static, display, in, the, science, museum, london, george, stephenson, built, locomotion, no, 1, for, the, stockton, darlington, railway, in, the, north, east, of, england, which, was, the, first, public, steam, railway, in, the, world, in, 1829, his, son, robert, built, the, rocket, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, rocket, was, entered, into, and, won, the, rainhill, trials, this, success, led, to, the, company, emerging, as, the, pre, eminent, early, builder, of, steam, locomotives, used, on, railways, in, the, uk, us, and, much, of, europe, the, liverpool, manchester, railway, built, by, stephenson, opened, a, year, later, making, exclusive, use, of, steam, power, for, passenger, and, goods, trains, the, steam, locomotive, remained, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, locomotive, until, after, world, war, ii, steam, locomotives, are, less, efficient, than, modern, diesel, and, electric, locomotives, and, a, significantly, larger, workforce, is, required, to, operate, and, service, them, british, rail, figures, showed, that, the, cost, of, crewing, and, fuelling, a, steam, locomotive, was, about, two, and, a, half, times, larger, than, the, cost, of, supporting, an, equivalent, diesel, locomotive, and, the, daily, mileage, they, could, run, was, lower, between, about, 1950, and, 1970, the, majority, of, steam, locomotives, were, retired, from, commercial, service, and, replaced, with, electric, and, diesel, electric, locomotives, while, north, america, transitioned, from, steam, during, the, 1950s, and, continental, europe, by, the, 1970s, in, other, parts, of, the, world, the, transition, happened, later, steam, was, a, familiar, technology, that, used, widely, available, fuels, and, in, low, wage, economies, did, not, suffer, as, wide, a, cost, disparity, it, continued, to, be, used, in, many, countries, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, almost, the, only, steam, power, remaining, in, regular, use, around, the, world, was, on, heritage, railways, internal, combustion, locomotives, use, an, internal, combustion, engine, connected, to, the, driving, wheels, by, a, transmission, typically, they, keep, the, engine, running, at, a, near, constant, speed, whether, the, locomotive, is, stationary, or, moving, internal, combustion, locomotives, are, categorised, by, their, fuel, type, and, sub, categorised, by, their, transmission, type, benzene, locomotives, have, an, internal, combustion, engines, that, use, benzene, as, fuel, between, the, late, 1890, s, and, 1900, s, a, number, of, commercial, manufacturers, for, benzene, locomotives, had, been, operating, this, began, with, deutz, that, produced, an, operating, system, based, upon, a, design, prototype, for, a, manganese, mine, in, giessen, then, in, the, early, 1900, s, they, were, sold, for, multiple, mining, and, tunnelling, operations, post, the, 1900, s, no, wide, spread, use, was, necessary, or, required, their, inadequacy, had, increased, with, the, existence, of, petrol, and, diesel, locomotives, kerosene, locomotives, use, kerosene, as, the, fuel, they, were, the, world, s, first, internal, combustion, locomotives, preceding, diesel, and, other, oil, locomotives, by, some, years, the, first, known, kerosene, rail, vehicle, was, a, draisine, built, by, gottlieb, daimler, in, 1887, but, this, was, not, technically, a, locomotive, as, it, carried, a, payload, a, kerosene, locomotive, was, built, in, 1894, by, the, priestman, brothers, of, kingston, upon, hull, for, use, on, hull, docks, this, locomotive, was, built, using, a, 12, hp, double, acting, marine, type, engine, running, at, 300, rpm, mounted, on, a, 4, wheel, wagon, chassis, it, was, only, able, to, haul, one, loaded, wagon, at, a, time, due, to, its, low, power, output, and, was, not, a, great, success, the, first, successful, kerosene, locomotive, was, lachesis, built, by, richard, hornsby, sons, and, delivered, to, woolwich, arsenal, railway, in, 1896, the, company, built, four, kerosene, locomotives, between, 1896, and, 1903, for, use, at, the, arsenal, petrol, locomotives, us, gasoline, locomotives, use, petrol, gasoline, as, their, fuel, the, first, commercially, successful, petrol, locomotive, was, a, petrol, mechanical, locomotive, built, by, the, maudslay, motor, company, in, 1902, for, the, deptford, cattle, market, in, london, it, was, an, 80, hp, locomotive, using, a, 3, cylinder, vertical, petrol, engine, with, a, two, speed, mechanical, gearbox, the, most, common, type, of, petrol, locomotive, are, petrol, mechanical, locomotives, which, use, mechanical, transmission, in, the, form, of, gearboxes, sometimes, in, conjunction, with, chain, drives, to, deliver, the, power, output, of, the, engine, to, the, driving, wheels, in, the, same, way, as, a, car, the, second, petrol, mechanical, locomotive, was, built, by, f, c, blake, of, kew, in, january, 1903, for, the, richmond, main, sewerage, board, petrol, electric, locomotives, are, petrol, locomotives, which, use, electric, transmission, to, deliver, the, power, output, of, the, engine, to, the, driving, wheels, this, avoids, the, need, for, gearboxes, by, converting, the, rotary, mechanical, force, of, the, engine, into, electrical, energy, by, a, dynamo, and, then, powering, the, wheels, by, multi, speed, electric, traction, motors, this, allows, for, smoother, acceleration, it, avoids, the, need, for, gear, changes, however, it, is, more, expensive, heavier, and, sometimes, bulkier, than, mechanical, transmissions, a, notable, early, petrol, electric, locomotive, was, built, in, 1913, for, the, minneapolis, st, paul, rochester, and, dubuque, electric, traction, company, it, weighed, 60, tons, generated, 350, hp, and, drove, through, a, pair, of, bogies, in, a, bo, bo, arrangement, diesel, locomotives, are, powered, by, diesel, engines, in, the, early, days, of, diesel, propulsion, development, various, transmission, systems, were, employed, with, varying, degrees, of, success, with, electric, transmission, proving, to, be, the, most, popular, a, diesel, mechanical, locomotive, uses, mechanical, transmission, to, transfer, power, to, the, wheels, this, type, of, transmission, is, generally, limited, to, low, powered, low, speed, shunting, switching, locomotives, lightweight, multiple, units, and, self, propelled, railcars, the, earliest, diesel, locomotives, were, diesel, mechanical, in, 1906, rudolf, diesel, adolf, klose, and, the, steam, and, diesel, engine, manufacturer, gebr, der, sulzer, founded, diesel, sulzer, klose, gmbh, to, manufacture, diesel, powered, locomotives, the, prussian, state, railways, ordered, a, diesel, locomotive, from, the, company, in, 1909, the, world, s, first, diesel, powered, locomotive, a, diesel, mechanical, locomotive, was, operated, in, the, summer, of, 1912, on, the, winterthur, romanshorn, railway, in, switzerland, but, was, not, a, commercial, success, small, numbers, of, prototype, diesel, locomotives, were, produced, in, a, number, of, countries, through, the, mid, 1920s, diesel, electric, locomotives, are, diesel, locomotives, using, electric, transmission, the, diesel, engine, drives, either, an, electrical, dc, generator, generally, less, than, 3, 000, horsepower, 2, 200, kw, net, for, traction, or, an, electrical, ac, alternator, rectifier, generally, 3, 000, horsepower, 2, 200, kw, net, or, more, for, traction, the, output, of, which, provides, power, to, the, traction, motors, that, drive, the, locomotive, there, is, no, mechanical, connection, between, the, diesel, engine, and, the, wheels, the, vast, majority, of, diesel, locomotives, today, are, diesel, electric, in, 1914, hermann, lemp, a, general, electric, electrical, engineer, developed, and, patented, a, reliable, direct, current, electrical, control, system, subsequent, improvements, were, also, patented, by, lemp, lemp, s, design, used, a, single, lever, to, control, both, engine, and, generator, in, a, coordinated, fashion, and, was, the, prototype, for, all, diesel, electric, locomotive, control, in, 1917, 18, ge, produced, three, experimental, diesel, electric, locomotives, using, lemp, s, control, design, in, 1924, a, diesel, electric, locomotive, e, el, 2, original, number, 001, yu, e, 001, started, operations, it, had, been, designed, by, a, team, led, by, yury, lomonosov, and, built, 1923, 1924, by, maschinenfabrik, esslingen, in, germany, it, had, 5, driving, axles, 1, e1, after, several, test, rides, it, hauled, trains, for, almost, three, decades, from, 1925, to, 1954, diesel, hydraulic, locomotives, are, diesel, locomotives, using, hydraulic, transmission, in, this, arrangement, they, use, one, or, more, torque, converters, in, combination, with, gears, with, a, mechanical, final, drive, to, convey, the, power, from, the, diesel, engine, to, the, wheels, the, main, worldwide, user, of, main, line, hydraulic, transmission, locomotives, was, deutsche, bundesbahn, with, designs, including, the, db, class, v, 200, and, the, db, v, 160, family, british, rail, introduced, a, number, of, diesel, hydraulic, designs, during, its, 1955, modernisation, plan, initially, licence, built, versions, of, german, designs, in, spain, renfe, used, high, power, to, weight, ratio, twin, engined, german, designs, to, haul, high, speed, trains, from, the, 1960s, to, 1990s, see, renfe, classes, 340, 350, 352, 353, 354, hydrostatic, drive, systems, have, also, been, applied, to, rail, use, for, example, 350, to, 750, hp, 260, to, 560, kw, shunting, locomotives, by, cmi, group, belgium, hydrostatic, drives, are, also, used, in, railway, maintenance, machines, such, as, tampers, and, rail, grinders, a, gas, turbine, locomotive, is, an, internal, combustion, engine, locomotive, consisting, of, a, gas, turbine, ice, engines, require, a, transmission, to, power, the, wheels, the, engine, must, be, allowed, to, continue, to, run, when, the, locomotive, is, stopped, gas, turbine, mechanical, locomotives, use, a, mechanical, transmission, to, deliver, the, power, output, of, gas, turbines, to, the, wheels, a, gas, turbine, locomotive, was, patented, in, 1861, by, marc, antoine, francois, mennons, british, patent, no, 1633, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, locomotive, was, actually, built, but, the, design, includes, the, essential, features, of, gas, turbine, locomotives, including, compressor, combustion, chamber, turbine, and, air, pre, heater, in, 1952, renault, delivered, a, prototype, four, axle, 1150, hp, gas, turbine, mechanical, locomotive, fitted, with, the, pescara, free, turbine, gas, and, compressed, air, producing, system, rather, than, a, co, axial, multi, stage, compressor, integral, to, the, turbine, this, model, was, succeeded, by, a, pair, of, six, axle, 2400, hp, locomotives, with, two, turbines, and, pescara, feeds, in, 1959, several, similar, locomotives, were, built, in, ussr, by, kharkov, locomotive, works, gas, turbine, electric, locomotives, use, a, gas, turbine, to, drive, an, electrical, generator, or, alternator, which, produced, electric, current, powers, the, traction, motor, which, drive, the, wheels, in, 1939, the, swiss, federal, railways, ordered, am, 4, 6, a, gtel, with, a, 1, 620, kw, 2, 170, hp, of, maximum, engine, power, from, brown, boveri, it, was, completed, in, 1941, and, then, underwent, testing, before, entering, regular, service, the, am, 4, 6, was, the, first, gas, turbine, electric, locomotive, british, rail, 18000, was, built, by, brown, boveri, and, delivered, in, 1949, british, rail, 18100, was, built, by, metropolitan, vickers, and, delivered, in, 1951, a, third, locomotive, the, british, rail, gt3, was, constructed, in, 1961, union, pacific, ran, a, large, fleet, of, turbine, powered, freight, locomotives, starting, in, the, 1950s, these, were, widely, used, on, long, haul, routes, and, were, cost, effective, despite, their, poor, fuel, economy, due, to, their, use, of, leftover, fuels, from, the, petroleum, industry, at, their, height, the, railroad, estimated, that, they, powered, about, 10, of, union, pacific, s, freight, trains, a, much, wider, use, than, any, other, example, of, this, class, a, gas, turbine, offers, some, advantages, over, a, piston, engine, there, are, few, moving, parts, decreasing, the, need, for, lubrication, and, potentially, reducing, maintenance, costs, and, the, power, to, weight, ratio, is, much, higher, a, turbine, of, a, given, power, output, is, also, physically, smaller, than, an, equally, powerful, piston, engine, allowing, a, locomotive, to, be, very, powerful, without, being, inordinately, large, however, a, turbine, s, power, output, and, efficiency, both, drop, dramatically, with, rotational, speed, unlike, a, piston, engine, which, has, a, comparatively, flat, power, curve, this, makes, gtel, systems, useful, primarily, for, long, distance, high, speed, runs, additional, problems, with, gas, turbine, electric, locomotives, included, that, they, were, very, noisy, some, locomotives, usually, in, france, and, italy, ran, on, a, wood, gas, generator, an, electric, locomotive, is, a, locomotive, powered, only, by, electricity, electricity, is, supplied, to, moving, trains, with, a, nearly, continuous, conductor, running, along, the, track, that, usually, takes, one, of, three, forms, an, overhead, line, suspended, from, poles, or, towers, along, the, track, or, from, structure, or, tunnel, ceilings, a, third, rail, mounted, at, track, level, or, an, onboard, battery, both, overhead, wire, and, third, rail, systems, usually, use, the, running, rails, as, the, return, conductor, but, some, systems, use, a, separate, fourth, rail, for, this, purpose, the, type, of, electrical, power, used, is, either, direct, current, dc, or, alternating, current, ac, various, collection, methods, exist, a, trolley, pole, which, is, a, long, flexible, pole, that, engages, the, line, with, a, wheel, or, shoe, a, bow, collector, which, is, a, frame, that, holds, a, long, collecting, rod, against, the, wire, a, pantograph, which, is, a, hinged, frame, that, holds, the, collecting, shoes, against, the, wire, in, a, fixed, geometry, or, a, contact, shoe, which, is, a, shoe, in, contact, with, the, third, rail, of, the, three, the, pantograph, method, is, best, suited, for, high, speed, operation, electric, locomotives, almost, universally, use, axle, hung, traction, motors, with, one, motor, for, each, powered, axle, in, this, arrangement, one, side, of, the, motor, housing, is, supported, by, plain, bearings, riding, on, a, ground, and, polished, journal, that, is, integral, to, the, axle, the, other, side, of, the, housing, has, a, tongue, shaped, protuberance, that, engages, a, matching, slot, in, the, truck, bogie, bolster, its, purpose, being, to, act, as, a, torque, reaction, device, as, well, as, a, support, power, transfer, from, motor, to, axle, is, effected, by, spur, gearing, in, which, a, pinion, on, the, motor, shaft, engages, a, bull, gear, on, the, axle, both, gears, are, enclosed, in, a, liquid, tight, housing, containing, lubricating, oil, the, type, of, service, in, which, the, locomotive, is, used, dictates, the, gear, ratio, employed, numerically, high, ratios, are, commonly, found, on, freight, units, whereas, numerically, low, ratios, are, typical, of, passenger, engines, electricity, is, typically, generated, in, large, and, relatively, efficient, generating, stations, transmitted, to, the, railway, network, and, distributed, to, the, trains, some, electric, railways, have, their, own, dedicated, generating, stations, and, transmission, lines, but, most, purchase, power, from, an, electric, utility, the, railway, usually, provides, its, own, distribution, lines, switches, and, transformers, electric, locomotives, usually, cost, 20, less, than, diesel, locomotives, their, maintenance, costs, are, 25, 35, lower, and, cost, up, to, 50, less, to, run, the, earliest, systems, were, dc, systems, the, first, electric, passenger, train, was, presented, by, werner, von, siemens, at, berlin, in, 1879, the, locomotive, was, driven, by, a, 2, 2, kw, series, wound, motor, and, the, train, consisting, of, the, locomotive, and, three, cars, reached, a, speed, of, 13, km, h, during, four, months, the, train, carried, 90, 000, passengers, on, a, 300, metre, long, 984, feet, circular, track, the, electricity, 150, v, dc, was, supplied, through, a, third, insulated, rail, between, the, tracks, a, contact, roller, was, used, to, collect, the, electricity, the, world, s, first, electric, tram, line, opened, in, lichterfelde, near, berlin, germany, in, 1881, it, was, built, by, werner, von, siemens, see, gross, lichterfelde, tramway, and, berlin, stra, enbahn, the, volk, s, electric, railway, opened, in, 1883, in, brighton, and, is, the, oldest, surviving, electric, railway, also, in, 1883, m, dling, and, hinterbr, hl, tram, opened, near, vienna, in, austria, it, was, the, first, in, the, world, in, regular, service, powered, from, an, overhead, line, five, years, later, in, the, u, s, electric, trolleys, were, pioneered, in, 1888, on, the, richmond, union, passenger, railway, using, equipment, designed, by, frank, j, sprague, the, first, electrically, worked, underground, line, was, the, city, south, london, railway, prompted, by, a, clause, in, its, enabling, act, prohibiting, use, of, steam, power, it, opened, in, 1890, using, electric, locomotives, built, by, mather, platt, electricity, quickly, became, the, power, supply, of, choice, for, subways, abetted, by, the, sprague, s, invention, of, multiple, unit, train, control, in, 1897, the, first, use, of, electrification, on, a, main, line, was, on, a, four, mile, stretch, of, the, baltimore, belt, line, of, the, baltimore, ohio, b, o, in, 1895, connecting, the, main, portion, of, the, b, o, to, the, new, line, to, new, york, through, a, series, of, tunnels, around, the, edges, of, baltimore, s, downtown, three, bo, bo, units, were, initially, used, at, the, south, end, of, the, electrified, section, they, coupled, onto, the, locomotive, and, train, and, pulled, it, through, the, tunnels, dc, was, used, on, earlier, systems, these, systems, were, gradually, replaced, by, ac, today, almost, all, main, line, railways, use, ac, systems, dc, systems, are, confined, mostly, to, urban, transit, such, as, metro, systems, light, rail, and, trams, where, power, requirement, is, less, the, first, practical, ac, electric, locomotive, was, designed, by, charles, brown, then, working, for, oerlikon, z, rich, in, 1891, brown, had, demonstrated, long, distance, power, transmission, using, three, phase, ac, between, a, hydro, electric, plant, at, lauffen, am, neckar, and, frankfurt, am, main, west, a, distance, of, 280, km, using, experience, he, had, gained, while, working, for, jean, heilmann, on, steam, electric, locomotive, designs, brown, observed, that, three, phase, motors, had, a, higher, power, to, weight, ratio, than, dc, motors, and, because, of, the, absence, of, a, commutator, were, simpler, to, manufacture, and, maintain, however, they, were, much, larger, than, the, dc, motors, of, the, time, and, could, not, be, mounted, in, underfloor, bogies, they, could, only, be, carried, within, locomotive, bodies, in, 1894, hungarian, engineer, k, lm, n, kand, developed, a, new, type, 3, phase, asynchronous, electric, drive, motors, and, generators, for, electric, locomotives, kand, s, early, 1894, designs, were, first, applied, in, a, short, three, phase, ac, tramway, in, evian, les, bains, france, which, was, constructed, between, 1896, and, 1898, in, 1918, kand, invented, and, developed, the, rotary, phase, converter, enabling, electric, locomotives, to, use, three, phase, motors, whilst, supplied, via, a, single, overhead, wire, carrying, the, simple, industrial, frequency, 50, hz, single, phase, ac, of, the, high, voltage, national, networks, in, 1896, oerlikon, installed, the, first, commercial, example, of, the, system, on, the, lugano, tramway, each, 30, tonne, locomotive, had, two, 110, kw, 150, hp, motors, run, by, three, phase, 750, v, 40, hz, fed, from, double, overhead, lines, three, phase, motors, run, at, constant, speed, and, provide, regenerative, braking, and, are, well, suited, to, steeply, graded, routes, and, the, first, main, line, three, phase, locomotives, were, supplied, by, brown, by, then, in, partnership, with, walter, boveri, in, 1899, on, the, 40, km, burgdorf, thun, line, switzerland, the, first, implementation, of, industrial, frequency, single, phase, ac, supply, for, locomotives, came, from, oerlikon, in, 1901, using, the, designs, of, hans, behn, eschenburg, and, emil, huber, stockar, installation, on, the, seebach, wettingen, line, of, the, swiss, federal, railways, was, completed, in, 1904, the, 15, kv, 50, hz, 345, kw, 460, hp, 48, tonne, locomotives, used, transformers, and, rotary, converters, to, power, dc, traction, motors, italian, railways, were, the, first, in, the, world, to, introduce, electric, traction, for, the, entire, length, of, a, main, line, rather, than, just, a, short, stretch, the, 106, km, valtellina, line, was, opened, on, 4, september, 1902, designed, by, kand, and, a, team, from, the, ganz, works, the, electrical, system, was, three, phase, at, 3, kv, 15, hz, the, voltage, was, significantly, higher, than, used, earlier, and, it, required, new, designs, for, electric, motors, and, switching, devices, the, three, phase, two, wire, system, was, used, on, several, railways, in, northern, italy, and, became, known, as, the, italian, system, kand, was, invited, in, 1905, to, undertake, the, management, of, societ, italiana, westinghouse, and, led, the, development, of, several, italian, electric, locomotives, a, battery, electric, locomotive, or, battery, locomotive, is, an, electric, locomotive, powered, by, onboard, batteries, a, kind, of, battery, electric, vehicle, such, locomotives, are, used, where, a, conventional, diesel, or, electric, locomotive, would, be, unsuitable, an, example, is, maintenance, trains, on, electrified, lines, when, the, electricity, supply, is, turned, off, another, use, is, in, industrial, facilities, where, a, combustion, powered, locomotive, i, e, steam, or, diesel, powered, could, cause, a, safety, issue, due, to, the, risks, of, fire, explosion, or, fumes, in, a, confined, space, battery, locomotives, are, preferred, for, mines, where, gas, could, be, ignited, by, trolley, powered, units, arcing, at, the, collection, shoes, or, where, electrical, resistance, could, develop, in, the, supply, or, return, circuits, especially, at, rail, joints, and, allow, dangerous, current, leakage, into, the, ground, battery, locomotives, in, over, the, road, service, can, recharge, while, absorbing, dynamic, braking, energy, the, first, known, electric, locomotive, was, built, in, 1837, by, chemist, robert, davidson, of, aberdeen, and, it, was, powered, by, galvanic, cells, batteries, davidson, later, built, a, larger, locomotive, named, galvani, exhibited, at, the, royal, scottish, society, of, arts, exhibition, in, 1841, the, seven, ton, vehicle, had, two, direct, drive, reluctance, motors, with, fixed, electromagnets, acting, on, iron, bars, attached, to, a, wooden, cylinder, on, each, axle, and, simple, commutators, it, hauled, a, load, of, six, tons, at, four, miles, per, hour, 6, kilometers, per, hour, for, a, distance, of, one, and, a, half, miles, 2, 4, kilometres, it, was, tested, on, the, edinburgh, and, glasgow, railway, in, september, of, the, following, year, but, the, limited, power, from, batteries, prevented, its, general, use, another, example, was, at, the, kennecott, copper, mine, latouche, alaska, where, in, 1917, the, underground, haulage, ways, were, widened, to, enable, working, by, two, battery, locomotives, of, 4, 1, 2, tons, in, 1928, kennecott, copper, ordered, four, 700, series, electric, locomotives, with, on, board, batteries, these, locomotives, weighed, 85, tons, and, operated, on, 750, volt, overhead, trolley, wire, with, considerable, further, range, whilst, running, on, batteries, the, locomotives, provided, several, decades, of, service, using, nickel, iron, battery, edison, technology, the, batteries, were, replaced, with, lead, acid, batteries, and, the, locomotives, were, retired, shortly, afterward, all, four, locomotives, were, donated, to, museums, but, one, was, scrapped, the, others, can, be, seen, at, the, boone, and, scenic, valley, railroad, iowa, and, at, the, western, railway, museum, in, rio, vista, california, the, toronto, transit, commission, previously, operated, a, battery, electric, locomotive, built, by, nippon, sharyo, in, 1968, and, retired, in, 2009, london, underground, regularly, operates, battery, electric, locomotives, for, general, maintenance, work, in, the, early, 1950s, lyle, borst, of, the, university, of, utah, was, given, funding, by, various, us, railroad, line, and, manufacturers, to, study, the, feasibility, of, an, electric, drive, locomotive, in, which, an, onboard, atomic, reactor, produced, the, steam, to, generate, the, electricity, at, that, time, atomic, power, was, not, fully, understood, borst, believed, the, major, stumbling, block, was, the, price, of, uranium, with, the, borst, atomic, locomotive, the, center, section, would, have, a, 200, ton, reactor, chamber, and, steel, walls, 5, feet, thick, to, prevent, releases, of, radioactivity, in, case, of, accidents, he, estimated, a, cost, to, manufacture, atomic, locomotives, with, 7000, h, p, engines, at, approximately, 1, 200, 000, each, consequently, trains, with, onboard, nuclear, generators, were, generally, deemed, unfeasible, due, to, prohibitive, costs, in, 2002, the, first, 3, 6, tonne, 17, kw, hydrogen, fuel, cell, powered, mining, locomotive, was, demonstrated, in, val, d, or, quebec, in, 2007, the, educational, mini, hydrail, in, kaohsiung, taiwan, went, into, service, the, railpower, gg20b, finally, is, another, example, of, a, fuel, cell, electric, locomotive, there, are, many, different, types, of, hybrid, or, dual, mode, locomotives, using, two, or, more, types, of, motive, power, the, most, common, hybrids, are, electro, diesel, locomotives, powered, either, from, an, electricity, supply, or, else, by, an, onboard, diesel, engine, these, are, used, to, provide, continuous, journeys, along, routes, that, are, only, partly, electrified, examples, include, the, emd, fl9, and, bombardier, alp, 45dp, there, are, three, main, uses, of, locomotives, in, rail, transport, operations, for, hauling, passenger, trains, freight, trains, and, for, switching, uk, english, shunting, freight, locomotives, are, normally, designed, to, deliver, high, starting, tractive, effort, and, high, sustained, power, this, allows, them, to, start, and, move, long, heavy, trains, but, usually, comes, at, the, cost, of, relatively, low, maximum, speeds, passenger, locomotives, usually, develop, lower, starting, tractive, effort, but, are, able, to, operate, at, the, high, speeds, required, to, maintain, passenger, schedules, mixed, traffic, locomotives, us, english, general, purpose, or, road, switcher, locomotives, meant, for, both, passenger, and, freight, trains, do, not, develop, as, much, starting, tractive, effort, as, a, freight, locomotive, but, are, able, to, haul, heavier, trains, than, a, passenger, locomotive, most, steam, locomotives, have, reciprocating, engines, with, pistons, coupled, to, the, driving, wheels, by, means, of, connecting, rods, with, no, intervening, gearbox, this, means, the, combination, of, starting, tractive, effort, and, maximum, speed, is, greatly, influenced, by, the, diameter, of, the, driving, wheels, steam, locomotives, intended, for, freight, service, generally, have, smaller, diameter, driving, wheels, than, passenger, locomotives, in, diesel, electric, and, electric, locomotives, the, control, system, between, the, traction, motors, and, axles, adapts, the, power, output, to, the, rails, for, freight, or, passenger, service, passenger, locomotives, may, include, other, features, such, as, head, end, power, also, referred, to, as, hotel, power, or, electric, train, supply, or, a, steam, generator, some, locomotives, are, designed, specifically, to, work, steep, grade, railways, and, feature, extensive, additional, braking, mechanisms, and, sometimes, rack, and, pinion, steam, locomotives, built, for, steep, rack, and, pinion, railways, frequently, have, the, boiler, tilted, relative, to, the, locomotive, frame, so, that, the, boiler, remains, roughly, level, on, steep, grades, locomotives, are, also, used, on, some, high, speed, trains, some, of, them, are, operated, in, push, pull, formation, with, trailer, control, cars, at, another, end, of, a, train, which, often, have, a, cabin, with, the, same, design, as, a, cabin, of, locomotive, examples, of, such, trains, with, conventional, locomotives, are, railjet, and, intercity, 225, also, many, high, speed, trains, including, all, tgv, many, talgo, 250, 350, avril, xxi, some, korea, train, express, ice, 1, ice, 2, and, intercity, 125, use, dedicated, power, cars, which, do, not, have, places, for, passengers, and, technically, are, special, single, ended, locomotives, the, difference, from, conventional, locomotives, is, that, these, power, cars, are, integral, part, of, a, train, and, are, not, adapted, for, operation, with, any, other, types, of, passenger, coaches, on, the, other, hand, many, high, speed, trains, such, as, the, shinkansen, network, never, use, locomotives, instead, of, locomotive, like, power, cars, they, use, electric, multiple, units, emus, or, diesel, multiple, units, dmus, passenger, cars, that, also, have, traction, motors, and, power, equipment, using, dedicated, locomotive, like, power, cars, allows, for, a, high, ride, quality, and, less, electrical, equipment, but, emus, have, less, axle, weight, which, reduces, maintenance, costs, and, emus, also, have, higher, acceleration, and, higher, seating, capacity, also, some, trains, including, tgv, pse, tgv, tmst, and, tgv, v150, use, both, non, passenger, power, cars, and, additional, passenger, motor, cars, locomotives, occasionally, work, in, a, specific, role, such, as, the, wheel, arrangement, of, a, locomotive, describes, how, many, wheels, it, has, common, methods, include, the, aar, wheel, arrangement, uic, classification, and, whyte, notation, systems, in, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, remote, control, locomotives, started, to, enter, service, in, switching, operations, being, remotely, controlled, by, an, operator, outside, of, the, locomotive, cab, the, main, benefit, is, one, operator, can, control, the, loading, of, grain, coal, gravel, etc, into, the, cars, in, addition, the, same, operator, can, move, the, train, as, needed, thus, the, locomotive, is, loaded, or, unloaded, in, about, a, third, of, the, time, media, related, to,
