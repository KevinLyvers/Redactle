interchangeable, parts, are, parts, components, that, are, identical, for, practical, purposes, they, are, made, to, specifications, that, ensure, that, they, are, so, nearly, identical, that, they, will, fit, into, any, assembly, of, the, same, type, one, such, part, can, freely, replace, another, without, any, custom, fitting, such, as, filing, this, interchangeability, allows, easy, assembly, of, new, devices, and, easier, repair, of, existing, devices, while, minimizing, both, the, time, and, skill, required, of, the, person, doing, the, assembly, or, repair, the, concept, of, interchangeability, was, crucial, to, the, introduction, of, the, assembly, line, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, has, become, an, important, element, of, some, modern, manufacturing, but, is, missing, from, other, important, industries, interchangeability, of, parts, was, achieved, by, combining, a, number, of, innovations, and, improvements, in, machining, operations, and, the, invention, of, several, machine, tools, such, as, the, slide, rest, lathe, screw, cutting, lathe, turret, lathe, milling, machine, and, metal, planer, additional, innovations, included, jigs, for, guiding, the, machine, tools, fixtures, for, holding, the, workpiece, in, the, proper, position, and, blocks, and, gauges, to, check, the, accuracy, of, the, finished, parts, electrification, allowed, individual, machine, tools, to, be, powered, by, electric, motors, eliminating, line, shaft, drives, from, steam, engines, or, water, power, and, allowing, higher, speeds, making, modern, large, scale, manufacturing, possible, modern, machine, tools, often, have, numerical, control, nc, which, evolved, into, cnc, computerized, numeric, control, when, microprocessors, became, available, methods, for, industrial, production, of, interchangeable, parts, in, the, united, states, were, first, developed, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, term, american, system, of, manufacturing, was, sometimes, applied, to, them, at, the, time, in, distinction, from, earlier, methods, within, a, few, decades, such, methods, were, in, use, in, various, countries, so, american, system, is, now, a, term, of, historical, reference, rather, than, current, industrial, nomenclature, evidence, of, the, use, of, interchangeable, parts, can, be, traced, back, over, two, thousand, years, to, carthage, in, the, first, punic, war, carthaginian, ships, had, standardized, interchangeable, parts, that, even, came, with, assembly, instructions, akin, to, tab, a, into, slot, b, marked, on, them, in, the, late, 18th, century, french, general, jean, baptiste, vaquette, de, gribeauval, promoted, standardized, weapons, in, what, became, known, as, the, syst, me, gribeauval, after, it, was, issued, as, a, royal, order, in, 1765, at, the, time, the, system, focused, on, artillery, more, than, on, muskets, or, handguns, one, of, the, accomplishments, of, the, system, was, that, solid, cast, cannons, were, bored, to, precise, tolerances, which, allowed, the, walls, to, be, thinner, than, cannons, poured, with, hollow, cores, however, because, cores, were, often, off, center, the, wall, thickness, determined, the, size, of, the, bore, standardized, boring, made, for, shorter, cannons, without, sacrificing, accuracy, and, range, because, of, the, tighter, fit, of, the, shells, it, also, allowed, standardization, of, the, shells, before, the, 18th, century, devices, such, as, guns, were, made, one, at, a, time, by, gunsmiths, in, a, unique, manner, if, one, single, component, of, a, firearm, needed, a, replacement, the, entire, firearm, either, had, to, be, sent, to, an, expert, gunsmith, for, custom, repairs, or, discarded, and, replaced, by, another, firearm, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, idea, of, replacing, these, methods, with, a, system, of, interchangeable, manufacture, gradually, developed, the, development, took, decades, and, involved, many, people, gribeauval, provided, patronage, to, honor, blanc, who, attempted, to, implement, the, syst, me, gribeauval, at, the, musket, level, by, around, 1778, honor, blanc, began, producing, some, of, the, first, firearms, with, interchangeable, flintlock, mechanisms, although, they, were, carefully, made, by, craftsmen, blanc, demonstrated, in, front, of, a, committee, of, scientists, that, his, muskets, could, be, fitted, with, flintlock, mechanisms, picked, at, random, from, a, pile, of, parts, in, 1785, muskets, with, interchangeable, locks, caught, the, attention, of, the, united, states, ambassador, to, france, thomas, jefferson, through, the, efforts, of, honor, blanc, jefferson, tried, unsuccessfully, to, persuade, blanc, to, move, to, america, then, wrote, to, the, american, secretary, of, war, with, the, idea, and, when, he, returned, to, the, usa, he, worked, to, fund, its, development, president, george, washington, approved, of, the, concept, and, in, 1798, eli, whitney, signed, a, contract, to, mass, produce, 12, 000, muskets, built, under, the, new, system, louis, de, tousard, who, fled, the, french, revolution, joined, the, u, s, corp, of, artillerists, in, 1795, and, wrote, an, influential, artillerist, s, manual, that, stressed, the, importance, of, standardization, numerous, inventors, began, to, try, to, implement, the, principle, blanc, had, described, the, development, of, the, machine, tools, and, manufacturing, practices, required, would, be, a, great, expense, to, the, u, s, ordnance, department, and, for, some, years, while, trying, to, achieve, interchangeability, the, firearms, produced, cost, more, to, manufacture, by, 1853, there, was, evidence, that, interchangeable, parts, then, perfected, by, the, federal, armories, led, to, savings, the, ordnance, department, freely, shared, the, techniques, used, with, outside, suppliers, in, the, us, eli, whitney, saw, the, potential, benefit, of, developing, interchangeable, parts, for, the, firearms, of, the, united, states, military, in, july, 1801, he, built, ten, guns, all, containing, the, same, exact, parts, and, mechanisms, then, disassembled, them, before, the, united, states, congress, he, placed, the, parts, in, a, mixed, pile, and, with, help, reassembled, all, of, the, firearms, in, front, of, congress, much, as, blanc, had, done, some, years, before, the, congress, was, captivated, and, ordered, a, standard, for, all, united, states, equipment, the, use, of, interchangeable, parts, removed, the, problems, of, earlier, eras, concerning, the, difficulty, or, impossibility, of, producing, new, parts, for, old, equipment, if, one, firearm, part, failed, another, could, be, ordered, and, the, firearm, would, not, need, to, be, discarded, the, catch, was, that, whitney, s, guns, were, costly, and, handmade, by, skilled, workmen, charles, fitch, credited, whitney, with, successfully, executing, a, firearms, contract, with, interchangeable, parts, using, the, american, system, but, historians, merritt, roe, smith, and, robert, b, gordon, have, since, determined, that, whitney, never, actually, achieved, interchangeable, parts, manufacturing, his, family, s, arms, company, however, did, so, after, his, death, mass, production, using, interchangeable, parts, was, first, achieved, in, 1803, by, marc, isambard, brunel, in, cooperation, with, henry, maudslay, and, simon, goodrich, under, the, management, of, and, with, contributions, by, brigadier, general, sir, samuel, bentham, the, inspector, general, of, naval, works, at, portsmouth, block, mills, portsmouth, dockyard, hampshire, england, at, the, time, the, napoleonic, war, was, at, its, height, and, the, royal, navy, was, in, a, state, of, expansion, that, required, 100, 000, pulley, blocks, to, be, manufactured, a, year, bentham, had, already, achieved, remarkable, efficiency, at, the, docks, by, introducing, power, driven, machinery, and, reorganising, the, dockyard, system, marc, brunel, a, pioneering, engineer, and, maudslay, a, founding, father, of, machine, tool, technology, who, had, developed, the, first, industrially, practical, screw, cutting, lathe, in, 1800, which, standardized, screw, thread, sizes, for, the, first, time, collaborated, on, plans, to, manufacture, block, making, machinery, the, proposal, was, submitted, to, the, admiralty, who, agreed, to, commission, his, services, by, 1805, the, dockyard, had, been, fully, updated, with, the, revolutionary, purpose, built, machinery, at, a, time, when, products, were, still, built, individually, with, different, components, a, total, of, 45, machines, were, required, to, perform, 22, processes, on, the, blocks, which, could, be, made, in, three, different, sizes, the, machines, were, almost, entirely, made, of, metal, thus, improving, their, accuracy, and, durability, the, machines, would, make, markings, and, indentations, on, the, blocks, to, ensure, alignment, throughout, the, process, one, of, the, many, advantages, of, this, new, method, was, the, increase, in, labour, productivity, due, to, the, less, labour, intensive, requirements, of, managing, the, machinery, richard, beamish, assistant, to, brunel, s, son, and, engineer, isambard, kingdom, brunel, wrote, so, that, ten, men, by, the, aid, of, this, machinery, can, accomplish, with, uniformity, celerity, and, ease, what, formerly, required, the, uncertain, labour, of, one, hundred, and, ten, by, 1808, annual, production, had, reached, 130, 000, blocks, and, some, of, the, equipment, was, still, in, operation, as, late, as, the, mid, twentieth, century, eli, terry, was, using, interchangeable, parts, using, a, milling, machine, as, early, as, 1800, ward, francillon, a, horologist, concluded, in, a, study, that, terry, had, already, accomplished, interchangeable, parts, as, early, as, 1800, the, study, examined, several, of, terry, s, clocks, produced, between, 1800, 1807, the, parts, were, labelled, and, interchanged, as, needed, the, study, concluded, that, all, clock, pieces, were, interchangeable, the, very, first, mass, production, using, interchangeable, parts, in, america, was, eli, terry, s, 1806, porter, contract, which, called, for, the, production, of, 4000, clocks, in, three, years, during, this, contract, terry, crafted, four, thousand, wooden, gear, tall, case, movements, at, a, time, when, the, annual, average, was, about, a, dozen, unlike, eli, whitney, terry, manufactured, his, products, without, government, funding, terry, saw, the, potential, of, clocks, becoming, a, household, object, with, the, use, of, a, milling, machine, terry, was, able, to, mass, produce, clock, wheels, and, plates, a, few, dozen, at, the, same, time, jigs, and, templates, were, used, to, make, uniform, pinions, so, that, all, parts, could, be, assembled, using, an, assembly, line, the, crucial, step, toward, interchangeability, in, metal, parts, was, taken, by, simeon, north, working, only, a, few, miles, from, eli, terry, north, created, one, of, the, world, s, first, true, milling, machines, to, do, metal, shaping, that, had, been, done, by, hand, with, a, file, diana, muir, believes, that, north, s, milling, machine, was, online, around, 1816, muir, merritt, roe, smith, and, robert, b, gordon, all, agree, that, before, 1832, both, simeon, north, and, john, hall, were, able, to, mass, produce, complex, machines, with, moving, parts, guns, using, a, system, that, entailed, the, use, of, rough, forged, parts, with, a, milling, machine, that, milled, the, parts, to, near, correct, size, and, that, were, then, filed, to, gage, by, hand, with, the, aid, of, filing, jigs, historians, differ, over, the, question, of, whether, hall, or, north, made, the, crucial, improvement, merrit, roe, smith, believes, that, it, was, done, by, hall, muir, demonstrates, the, close, personal, ties, and, professional, alliances, between, simeon, north, and, neighbouring, mechanics, mass, producing, wooden, clocks, to, argue, that, the, process, for, manufacturing, guns, with, interchangeable, parts, was, most, probably, devised, by, north, in, emulation, of, the, successful, methods, used, in, mass, producing, clocks, it, may, not, be, possible, to, resolve, the, question, with, absolute, certainty, unless, documents, now, unknown, should, surface, in, the, future, skilled, engineers, and, machinists, many, with, armoury, experience, spread, interchangeable, manufacturing, techniques, to, other, american, industries, including, clockmakers, and, sewing, machine, manufacturers, wilcox, and, gibbs, and, wheeler, and, wilson, who, used, interchangeable, parts, before, 1860, late, to, adopt, the, interchangeable, system, were, singer, corporation, sewing, machine, 1860s, 70s, reaper, manufacturer, mccormick, harvesting, machine, company, 1870s, 1880s, and, several, large, steam, engine, manufacturers, such, as, corliss, mid, 1880s, as, well, as, locomotive, makers, typewriters, followed, some, years, later, then, large, scale, production, of, bicycles, in, the, 1880s, began, to, use, the, interchangeable, system, during, these, decades, true, interchangeability, grew, from, a, scarce, and, difficult, achievement, into, an, everyday, capability, throughout, the, manufacturing, industries, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, historians, of, technology, broadened, the, world, s, understanding, of, the, history, of, the, development, few, people, outside, that, academic, discipline, knew, much, about, the, topic, until, as, recently, as, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, when, the, academic, knowledge, began, finding, wider, audiences, as, recently, as, the, 1960s, when, alfred, p, sloan, published, his, famous, memoir, and, management, treatise, my, years, with, general, motors, even, the, long, time, president, and, chair, of, the, largest, manufacturing, enterprise, that, had, ever, existed, knew, very, little, about, the, history, of, the, development, other, than, to, say, that, i, believe, one, of, those, mainly, responsible, for, bringing, the, technique, of, interchangeable, parts, into, automobile, manufacturing, it, has, been, called, to, my, attention, that, eli, whitney, long, before, had, started, the, development, of, interchangeable, parts, in, connection, with, the, manufacture, of, guns, a, fact, which, suggests, a, line, of, descent, from, whitney, to, leland, to, the, automobile, industry, one, of, the, better, known, books, on, the, subject, which, was, first, published, in, 1984, and, has, enjoyed, a, readership, beyond, academia, has, been, david, a, hounshell, s, from, the, american, system, to, mass, production, 1800, 1932, the, development, of, manufacturing, technology, in, the, united, states
