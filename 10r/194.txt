hydropower, from, ancient, greek, water, also, known, as, water, power, is, the, use, of, falling, or, fast, running, water, to, produce, electricity, or, to, power, machines, this, is, achieved, by, converting, the, gravitational, potential, or, kinetic, energy, of, a, water, source, to, produce, power, hydropower, is, a, method, of, sustainable, energy, production, hydropower, is, now, used, principally, for, hydroelectric, power, generation, and, is, also, applied, as, one, half, of, an, energy, storage, system, known, as, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, hydropower, is, an, attractive, alternative, to, fossil, fuels, as, it, does, not, directly, produce, carbon, dioxide, or, other, atmospheric, pollutants, and, it, provides, a, relatively, consistent, source, of, power, nonetheless, it, has, economic, sociological, and, environmental, downsides, and, requires, a, sufficiently, energetic, source, of, water, such, as, a, river, or, elevated, lake, international, institutions, such, as, the, world, bank, view, hydropower, as, a, low, carbon, means, for, economic, development, since, ancient, times, hydropower, from, watermills, has, been, used, as, a, renewable, energy, source, for, irrigation, and, the, operation, of, mechanical, devices, such, as, gristmills, sawmills, textile, mills, trip, hammers, dock, cranes, domestic, lifts, and, ore, mills, a, trompe, which, produces, compressed, air, from, falling, water, is, sometimes, used, to, power, other, machinery, at, a, distance, a, hydropower, resource, can, be, evaluated, by, its, available, power, power, is, a, function, of, the, hydraulic, head, and, volumetric, flow, rate, the, head, is, the, energy, per, unit, weight, or, unit, mass, of, water, the, static, head, is, proportional, to, the, difference, in, height, through, which, the, water, falls, dynamic, head, is, related, to, the, velocity, of, moving, water, each, unit, of, water, can, do, an, amount, of, work, equal, to, its, weight, times, the, head, the, power, available, from, falling, water, can, be, calculated, from, the, flow, rate, and, density, of, water, the, height, of, fall, and, the, local, acceleration, due, to, gravity, to, illustrate, the, power, output, of, a, turbine, that, is, 85, efficient, with, a, flow, rate, of, 80, cubic, metres, per, second, 2800, cubic, feet, per, second, and, a, head, of, 145, metres, 476, feet, is, 97, megawatts, operators, of, hydroelectric, stations, compare, the, total, electrical, energy, produced, with, the, theoretical, potential, energy, of, the, water, passing, through, the, turbine, to, calculate, efficiency, procedures, and, definitions, for, calculation, of, efficiency, are, given, in, test, codes, such, as, asme, ptc, 18, and, iec, 60041, field, testing, of, turbines, is, used, to, validate, the, manufacturer, s, efficiency, guarantee, detailed, calculation, of, the, efficiency, of, a, hydropower, turbine, accounts, for, the, head, lost, due, to, flow, friction, in, the, power, canal, or, penstock, rise, in, tailwater, level, due, to, flow, the, location, of, the, station, and, effect, of, varying, gravity, the, air, temperature, and, barometric, pressure, the, density, of, the, water, at, ambient, temperature, and, the, relative, altitudes, of, the, forebay, and, tailbay, for, precise, calculations, errors, due, to, rounding, and, the, number, of, significant, digits, of, constants, must, be, considered, some, hydropower, systems, such, as, water, wheels, can, draw, power, from, the, flow, of, a, body, of, water, without, necessarily, changing, its, height, in, this, case, the, available, power, is, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, flowing, water, over, shot, water, wheels, can, efficiently, capture, both, types, of, energy, the, flow, in, a, stream, can, vary, widely, from, season, to, season, the, development, of, a, hydropower, site, requires, analysis, of, flow, records, sometimes, spanning, decades, to, assess, the, reliable, annual, energy, supply, dams, and, reservoirs, provide, a, more, dependable, source, of, power, by, smoothing, seasonal, changes, in, water, flow, however, reservoirs, have, a, significant, environmental, impact, as, does, alteration, of, naturally, occurring, streamflow, dam, design, must, account, for, the, worst, case, probable, maximum, flood, that, can, be, expected, at, the, site, a, spillway, is, often, included, to, route, flood, flows, around, the, dam, a, computer, model, of, the, hydraulic, basin, and, rainfall, and, snowfall, records, are, used, to, predict, the, maximum, flood, some, disadvantages, of, hydropower, have, been, identified, dam, failures, can, have, catastrophic, effects, including, loss, of, life, property, and, pollution, of, land, dams, and, reservoirs, can, have, major, negative, impacts, on, river, ecosystems, such, as, preventing, some, animals, traveling, upstream, cooling, and, de, oxygenating, of, water, released, downstream, and, loss, of, nutrients, due, to, settling, of, particulates, river, sediment, builds, river, deltas, and, dams, prevent, them, from, restoring, what, is, lost, from, erosion, furthermore, studies, found, that, the, construction, of, dams, and, reservoirs, can, result, in, habitat, loss, for, some, aquatic, species, large, and, deep, dam, and, reservoir, plants, cover, large, areas, of, land, which, causes, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, underwater, rotting, vegetation, furthermore, although, at, lower, levels, than, other, renewable, energy, sources, it, was, found, that, hydropower, produces, methane, equivalent, to, almost, a, billion, tonnes, of, co2, greenhouse, gas, a, year, this, occurs, when, organic, matters, accumulate, at, the, bottom, of, the, reservoir, because, of, the, deoxygenation, of, water, which, triggers, anaerobic, digestion, people, who, live, near, a, hydro, plant, site, are, displaced, during, construction, or, when, reservoir, banks, become, unstable, another, potential, disadvantage, is, cultural, or, religious, sites, may, block, construction, a, watermill, or, water, mill, is, a, mill, that, uses, hydropower, it, is, a, structure, that, uses, a, water, wheel, or, water, turbine, to, drive, a, mechanical, process, such, as, milling, grinding, rolling, or, hammering, such, processes, are, needed, in, the, production, of, many, material, goods, including, flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and, many, metal, products, these, watermills, may, comprise, gristmills, sawmills, paper, mills, textile, mills, hammermills, trip, hammering, mills, rolling, mills, and, wire, drawing, mills, one, major, way, to, classify, watermills, is, by, wheel, orientation, vertical, or, horizontal, one, powered, by, a, vertical, waterwheel, through, a, gear, mechanism, and, the, other, equipped, with, a, horizontal, waterwheel, without, such, a, mechanism, the, former, type, can, be, further, subdivided, depending, on, where, the, water, hits, the, wheel, paddles, into, undershot, overshot, breastshot, and, pitchback, backshot, or, reverse, shot, waterwheel, mills, another, way, to, classify, water, mills, is, by, an, essential, trait, about, their, location, tide, mills, use, the, movement, of, the, tide, ship, mills, are, water, mills, onboard, and, constituting, a, ship, a, plentiful, head, of, water, can, be, made, to, generate, compressed, air, directly, without, moving, parts, in, these, designs, a, falling, column, of, water, is, deliberately, mixed, with, air, bubbles, generated, through, turbulence, or, a, venturi, pressure, reducer, at, the, high, level, intake, this, allows, it, to, fall, down, a, shaft, into, a, subterranean, high, roofed, chamber, where, the, now, compressed, air, separates, from, the, water, and, becomes, trapped, the, height, of, the, falling, water, column, maintains, compression, of, the, air, in, the, top, of, the, chamber, while, an, outlet, submerged, below, the, water, level, in, the, chamber, allows, water, to, flow, back, to, the, surface, at, a, lower, level, than, the, intake, a, separate, outlet, in, the, roof, of, the, chamber, supplies, the, compressed, air, a, facility, on, this, principle, was, built, on, the, montreal, river, at, ragged, shutes, near, cobalt, ontario, in, 1910, and, supplied, 5, 000, horsepower, to, nearby, mines, hydroelectricity, is, the, biggest, hydropower, application, hydroelectricity, generates, about, 15, of, global, electricity, and, provides, at, least, 50, of, the, total, electricity, supply, for, more, than, 35, countries, in, 2021, global, installed, hydropower, electrical, capacity, reached, almost, 1400, gw, the, highest, among, all, renewable, energy, technologies, hydroelectricity, generation, starts, with, converting, either, the, potential, energy, of, water, that, is, present, due, to, the, site, s, elevation, or, the, kinetic, energy, of, moving, water, into, electrical, energy, hydroelectric, power, plants, vary, in, terms, of, the, way, they, harvest, energy, one, type, involves, a, dam, and, a, reservoir, the, water, in, the, reservoir, is, available, on, demand, to, be, used, to, generate, electricity, by, passing, through, channels, that, connect, the, dam, to, the, reservoir, the, water, spins, a, turbine, which, is, connected, to, the, generator, that, produces, electricity, the, other, type, is, called, a, run, of, river, plant, in, this, case, a, barrage, is, built, to, control, the, flow, of, water, absent, a, reservoir, the, run, of, river, power, plant, needs, continuous, water, flow, and, therefore, has, less, ability, to, provide, power, on, demand, the, kinetic, energy, of, flowing, water, is, the, main, source, of, energy, both, designs, have, limitations, for, example, dam, construction, can, result, in, discomfort, to, nearby, residents, the, dam, and, reservoirs, occupy, a, relatively, large, amount, of, space, that, may, be, opposed, by, nearby, communities, moreover, reservoirs, can, potentially, have, major, environmental, consequences, such, as, harming, downstream, habitats, on, the, other, hand, the, limitation, of, the, run, of, river, project, is, the, decreased, efficiency, of, electricity, generation, because, the, process, depends, on, the, speed, of, the, seasonal, river, flow, this, means, that, the, rainy, season, increases, electricity, generation, compared, to, the, dry, season, the, size, of, hydroelectric, plants, can, vary, from, small, plants, called, micro, hydro, to, large, plants, that, supply, power, to, a, whole, country, as, of, 2019, the, five, largest, power, stations, in, the, world, are, conventional, hydroelectric, power, stations, with, dams, hydroelectricity, can, also, be, used, to, store, energy, in, the, form, of, potential, energy, between, two, reservoirs, at, different, heights, with, pumped, storage, water, is, pumped, uphill, into, reservoirs, during, periods, of, low, demand, to, be, released, for, generation, when, demand, is, high, or, system, generation, is, low, other, forms, of, electricity, generation, with, hydropower, include, tidal, stream, generators, using, energy, from, tidal, power, generated, from, oceans, rivers, and, human, made, canal, systems, to, generating, electricity, rain, has, been, referred, to, as, one, of, the, last, unexploited, energy, sources, in, nature, when, it, rains, billions, of, litres, of, water, can, fall, which, have, enormous, electric, potential, if, used, in, the, right, way, research, is, being, done, into, the, different, methods, of, generating, power, from, rain, such, as, by, using, the, energy, in, the, impact, of, raindrops, this, is, in, its, very, early, stages, with, new, and, emerging, technologies, being, tested, prototyped, and, created, such, power, has, been, called, rain, power, one, method, in, which, this, has, been, attempted, is, by, using, hybrid, solar, panels, called, all, weather, solar, panels, that, can, generate, electricity, from, both, the, sun, and, the, rain, according, to, zoologist, and, science, and, technology, educator, luis, villazon, a, 2008, french, study, estimated, that, you, could, use, piezoelectric, devices, which, generate, power, when, they, move, to, extract, 12, milliwatts, from, a, raindrop, over, a, year, this, would, amount, to, less, than, 0, 001kwh, per, square, metre, enough, to, power, a, remote, sensor, villazon, suggested, a, better, application, would, be, to, collect, the, water, from, fallen, rain, and, use, it, to, drive, a, turbine, with, an, estimated, energy, generation, of, 3, kwh, of, energy, per, year, for, a, 185, m, 2, roof, a, microturbine, based, system, created, by, three, students, from, the, technological, university, of, mexico, has, been, used, to, generate, electricity, the, pluvia, system, uses, the, stream, of, rainwater, runoff, from, houses, rooftop, rain, gutters, to, spin, a, microturbine, in, a, cylindrical, housing, electricity, generated, by, that, turbine, is, used, to, charge, 12, volt, batteries, the, term, rain, power, has, also, been, applied, to, hydropower, systems, which, include, the, process, of, capturing, the, rain, evidence, suggests, that, the, fundamentals, of, hydropower, date, to, ancient, greek, civilization, other, evidence, indicates, that, the, waterwheel, independently, emerged, in, china, around, the, same, period, evidence, of, water, wheels, and, watermills, date, to, the, ancient, near, east, in, the, 4th, century, bc, 14, moreover, evidence, indicates, the, use, of, hydropower, using, irrigation, machines, to, ancient, civilizations, such, as, sumer, and, babylonia, studies, suggest, that, the, water, wheel, was, the, initial, form, of, water, power, and, it, was, driven, by, either, humans, or, animals, in, the, roman, empire, water, powered, mills, were, described, by, vitruvius, by, the, first, century, bc, the, barbegal, mill, located, in, modern, day, france, had, 16, water, wheels, processing, up, to, 28, tons, of, grain, per, day, roman, waterwheels, were, also, used, for, sawing, marble, such, as, the, hierapolis, sawmill, of, the, late, 3rd, century, ad, such, sawmills, had, a, waterwheel, that, drove, two, crank, and, connecting, rods, to, power, two, saws, it, also, appears, in, two, 6th, century, eastern, roman, sawmills, excavated, at, ephesus, and, gerasa, respectively, the, crank, and, connecting, rod, mechanism, of, these, roman, watermills, converted, the, rotary, motion, of, the, waterwheel, into, the, linear, movement, of, the, saw, blades, water, powered, trip, hammers, and, bellows, in, china, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, were, initially, thought, to, be, powered, by, water, scoops, 26, 30, however, some, historians, suggested, that, they, were, powered, by, waterwheels, this, is, since, it, was, theorized, that, water, scoops, would, not, have, had, the, motive, force, to, operate, their, blast, furnace, bellows, many, texts, describe, the, hun, waterwheel, some, of, the, earliest, ones, are, the, jijiupian, dictionary, of, 40, bc, yang, xiong, s, text, known, as, the, fangyan, of, 15, bc, as, well, as, xin, lun, written, by, huan, tan, about, 20, ad, it, was, also, during, this, time, that, the, engineer, du, shi, c, ad, 31, applied, the, power, of, waterwheels, to, piston, bellows, in, forging, cast, iron, ancient, indian, texts, dating, back, to, the, 4th, century, bc, refer, to, the, term, cakkavattaka, turning, wheel, which, commentaries, explain, as, arahatta, ghati, yanta, machine, with, wheel, pots, attached, however, whether, this, is, water, or, hand, powered, is, disputed, by, scholars, india, received, roman, water, mills, and, baths, in, the, early, 4th, century, ad, when, a, certain, according, to, greek, sources, dams, spillways, reservoirs, channels, and, water, balance, would, develop, in, india, during, the, mauryan, gupta, and, chola, empires, another, example, of, the, early, use, of, hydropower, is, seen, in, hushing, a, historic, method, of, mining, that, uses, flood, or, torrent, of, water, to, reveal, mineral, veins, the, method, was, first, used, at, the, dolaucothi, gold, mines, in, wales, from, 75, ad, onwards, this, method, was, further, developed, in, spain, in, mines, such, as, las, m, dulas, hushing, was, also, widely, used, in, britain, in, the, medieval, and, later, periods, to, extract, lead, and, tin, ores, it, later, evolved, into, hydraulic, mining, when, used, during, the, california, gold, rush, in, the, 19th, century, the, islamic, empire, spanned, a, large, region, mainly, in, asia, and, africa, along, with, other, surrounding, areas, during, the, islamic, golden, age, and, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, 8th, 13th, centuries, hydropower, was, widely, used, and, developed, early, uses, of, tidal, power, emerged, along, with, large, hydraulic, factory, complexes, a, wide, range, of, water, powered, industrial, mills, were, used, in, the, region, including, fulling, mills, gristmills, paper, mills, hullers, sawmills, ship, mills, stamp, mills, steel, mills, sugar, mills, and, tide, mills, by, the, 11th, century, every, province, throughout, the, islamic, empire, had, these, industrial, mills, in, operation, from, al, andalus, and, north, africa, to, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, 10, muslim, engineers, also, used, water, turbines, while, employing, gears, in, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, they, also, pioneered, the, use, of, dams, as, a, source, of, water, power, used, to, provide, additional, power, to, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, islamic, irriguation, techniques, including, persian, wheels, would, be, introduced, to, india, and, would, be, combined, with, local, methods, during, the, delhi, sultanate, and, the, mughal, empire, furthermore, in, his, book, the, book, of, knowledge, of, ingenious, mechanical, devices, the, muslim, mechanical, engineer, al, jazari, 1136, 1206, described, designs, for, 50, devices, many, of, these, devices, were, water, powered, including, clocks, a, device, to, serve, wine, and, five, devices, to, lift, water, from, rivers, or, pools, where, three, of, them, are, animal, powered, and, one, can, be, powered, by, animal, or, water, moreover, they, included, an, endless, belt, with, jugs, attached, a, cow, powered, shadoof, a, crane, like, irrigation, tool, and, a, reciprocating, device, with, hinged, valves, in, the, 19th, century, french, engineer, beno, t, fourneyron, developed, the, first, hydropower, turbine, this, device, was, implemented, in, the, commercial, plant, of, niagara, falls, in, 1895, and, it, is, still, operating, in, the, early, 20th, century, english, engineer, william, armstrong, built, and, operated, the, first, private, electrical, power, station, which, was, located, in, his, house, in, cragside, in, northumberland, england, in, 1753, the, french, engineer, bernard, forest, de, b, lidor, published, his, book, architecture, hydraulique, which, described, vertical, axis, and, horizontal, axis, hydraulic, machines, the, growing, demand, for, the, industrial, revolution, would, drive, development, as, well, at, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, britain, water, was, the, main, power, source, for, new, inventions, such, as, richard, arkwright, s, water, frame, although, water, power, gave, way, to, steam, power, in, many, of, the, larger, mills, and, factories, it, was, still, used, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, for, many, smaller, operations, such, as, driving, the, bellows, in, small, blast, furnaces, e, g, the, dyfi, furnace, and, gristmills, such, as, those, built, at, saint, anthony, falls, which, uses, the, 50, foot, 15, m, drop, in, the, mississippi, river, technological, advances, moved, the, open, water, wheel, into, an, enclosed, turbine, or, water, motor, in, 1848, the, british, american, engineer, james, b, francis, head, engineer, of, lowell, s, locks, and, canals, company, improved, on, these, designs, to, create, a, turbine, with, 90, efficiency, he, applied, scientific, principles, and, testing, methods, to, the, problem, of, turbine, design, his, mathematical, and, graphical, calculation, methods, allowed, the, confident, design, of, high, efficiency, turbines, to, exactly, match, a, site, s, specific, flow, conditions, the, francis, reaction, turbine, is, still, in, use, in, the, 1870s, deriving, from, uses, in, the, california, mining, industry, lester, allan, pelton, developed, the, high, efficiency, pelton, wheel, impulse, turbine, which, used, hydropower, from, the, high, head, streams, characteristic, of, the, sierra, nevada, the, modern, history, of, hydropower, begins, in, the, 1900s, with, large, dams, built, not, simply, to, power, neighboring, mills, or, factories, but, provide, extensive, electricity, for, increasingly, distant, groups, of, people, competition, drove, much, of, the, global, hydroelectric, craze, europe, competed, amongst, itself, to, electrify, first, and, the, united, states, hydroelectric, plants, in, niagara, falls, and, the, sierra, nevada, inspired, bigger, and, bolder, creations, across, the, globe, american, and, ussr, financers, and, hydropower, experts, also, spread, the, gospel, of, dams, and, hydroelectricity, across, the, globe, during, the, cold, war, contributing, to, projects, such, as, the, three, gorges, dam, and, the, aswan, high, dam, feeding, desire, for, large, scale, electrification, with, water, inherently, required, large, dams, across, powerful, rivers, which, impacted, public, and, private, interests, downstream, and, in, flood, zones, inevitably, smaller, communities, and, marginalized, groups, suffered, they, were, unable, to, successfully, resist, companies, flooding, them, out, of, their, homes, or, blocking, traditional, salmon, passages, the, stagnant, water, created, by, hydroelectric, dams, provides, breeding, ground, for, pests, and, pathogens, leading, to, local, epidemics, however, in, some, cases, a, mutual, need, for, hydropower, could, lead, to, cooperation, between, otherwise, adversarial, nations, hydropower, technology, and, attitude, began, to, shift, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, while, countries, had, largely, abandoned, their, small, hydropower, systems, by, the, 1930s, the, smaller, hydropower, plants, began, to, make, a, comeback, in, the, 1970s, boosted, by, government, subsidies, and, a, push, for, more, independent, energy, producers, some, politicians, who, once, advocated, for, large, hydropower, projects, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, began, to, speak, out, against, them, and, citizen, groups, organizing, against, dam, projects, increased, in, the, 1980s, and, 90s, the, international, anti, dam, movement, had, made, finding, government, or, private, investors, for, new, large, hydropower, projects, incredibly, difficult, and, given, rise, to, ngos, devoted, to, fighting, dams, additionally, while, the, cost, of, other, energy, sources, fell, the, cost, of, building, new, hydroelectric, dams, increased, 4, annually, between, 1965, and, 1990, due, both, to, the, increasing, costs, of, construction, and, to, the, decrease, in, high, quality, building, sites, in, the, 1990s, only, 18, of, the, world, s, electricity, came, from, hydropower, tidal, power, production, also, emerged, in, the, 1960s, as, a, burgeoning, alternative, hydropower, system, though, still, has, not, taken, hold, as, a, strong, energy, contender, especially, at, the, start, of, the, american, hydropower, experiment, engineers, and, politicians, began, major, hydroelectricity, projects, to, solve, a, problem, of, wasted, potential, rather, than, to, power, a, population, that, needed, the, electricity, when, the, niagara, falls, power, company, began, looking, into, damming, niagara, the, first, major, hydroelectric, project, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1890s, they, struggled, to, transport, electricity, from, the, falls, far, enough, away, to, actually, reach, enough, people, and, justify, installation, the, project, succeeded, in, large, part, due, to, nikola, tesla, s, invention, of, the, alternating, current, motor, on, the, other, side, of, the, country, san, francisco, engineers, the, sierra, club, and, the, federal, government, fought, over, acceptable, use, of, the, hetch, hetchy, valley, despite, ostensible, protection, within, a, national, park, city, engineers, successfully, won, the, rights, to, both, water, and, power, in, the, hetch, hetchy, valley, in, 1913, after, their, victory, they, delivered, hetch, hetchy, hydropower, and, water, to, san, francisco, a, decade, later, and, at, twice, the, promised, cost, selling, power, to, pg, e, which, resold, to, san, francisco, residents, at, a, profit, the, american, west, with, its, mountain, rivers, and, lack, of, coal, turned, to, hydropower, early, and, often, especially, along, the, columbia, river, and, its, tributaries, the, bureau, of, reclamation, built, the, hoover, dam, in, 1931, symbolically, linking, the, job, creation, and, economic, growth, priorities, of, the, new, deal, the, federal, government, quickly, followed, hoover, with, the, shasta, dam, and, grand, coulee, dam, power, demand, in, oregon, did, not, justify, damming, the, columbia, until, wwi, revealed, the, weaknesses, of, a, coal, based, energy, economy, the, federal, government, then, began, prioritizing, interconnected, power, and, lots, of, it, electricity, from, all, three, dams, poured, into, war, production, during, wwii, after, the, war, the, grand, coulee, dam, and, accompanying, hydroelectric, projects, electrified, almost, all, of, the, rural, columbia, basin, but, failed, to, improve, the, lives, of, those, living, and, farming, there, the, way, its, boosters, had, promised, and, also, damaged, the, river, ecosystem, and, migrating, salmon, populations, in, the, 1940s, as, well, the, federal, government, took, advantage, of, the, sheer, amount, of, unused, power, and, flowing, water, from, the, grand, coulee, to, build, a, nuclear, site, placed, on, the, banks, of, the, columbia, the, nuclear, site, leaked, radioactive, matter, into, the, river, contaminating, the, entire, area, post, wwii, americans, especially, engineers, from, the, tennessee, valley, authority, refocused, from, simply, building, domestic, dams, to, promoting, hydropower, abroad, while, domestic, dam, building, continued, well, into, the, 1970s, with, the, reclamation, bureau, and, army, corps, of, engineers, building, more, than, 150, new, dams, across, the, american, west, organized, opposition, to, hydroelectric, dams, sparked, up, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, based, on, environmental, concerns, environmental, movements, successfully, shut, down, proposed, hydropower, dams, in, dinosaur, national, monument, and, the, grand, canyon, and, gained, more, hydropower, fighting, tools, with, 1970s, environmental, legislation, as, nuclear, and, fossil, fuels, grew, in, the, 70s, and, 80s, and, environmental, activists, push, for, river, restoration, hydropower, gradually, faded, in, american, importance, foreign, powers, and, igos, have, frequently, used, hydropower, projects, in, africa, as, a, tool, to, interfere, in, the, economic, development, of, african, countries, such, as, the, world, bank, with, the, kariba, and, akosombo, dams, and, the, soviet, union, with, the, aswan, dam, the, nile, river, especially, has, borne, the, consequences, of, countries, both, along, the, nile, and, distant, foreign, actors, using, the, river, to, expand, their, economic, power, or, national, force, after, the, british, occupation, of, egypt, in, 1882, the, british, worked, with, egypt, to, construct, the, first, aswan, dam, which, they, heightened, in, 1912, and, 1934, to, try, to, hold, back, the, nile, floods, egyptian, engineer, adriano, daninos, developed, a, plan, for, the, aswan, high, dam, inspired, by, the, tennessee, valley, authority, s, multipurpose, dam, when, gamal, abdel, nasser, took, power, in, the, 1950s, his, government, decided, to, undertake, the, high, dam, project, publicizing, it, as, an, economic, development, project, after, american, refusal, to, help, fund, the, dam, and, anti, british, sentiment, in, egypt, and, british, interests, in, neighboring, sudan, combined, to, make, the, united, kingdom, pull, out, as, well, the, soviet, union, funded, the, aswan, high, dam, between, 1977, and, 1990, the, dam, s, turbines, generated, one, third, of, egypt, s, electricity, the, building, of, the, aswan, dam, triggered, a, dispute, between, sudan, and, egypt, over, the, sharing, of, the, nile, especially, since, the, dam, flooded, part, of, sudan, and, decreased, the, volume, of, water, available, to, them, ethiopia, also, located, on, the, nile, took, advantage, of, the, cold, war, tensions, to, request, assistance, from, the, united, states, for, their, own, irrigation, and, hydropower, investments, in, the, 1960s, while, progress, stalled, due, to, the, coup, d, tat, of, 1974, and, following, 17, year, long, ethiopian, civil, war, ethiopia, began, construction, on, the, grand, ethiopian, renaissance, dam, in, 2011, beyond, the, nile, hydroelectric, projects, cover, the, rivers, and, lakes, of, africa, the, inga, powerplant, on, the, congo, river, had, been, discussed, since, belgian, colonization, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, was, successfully, built, after, independence, mobutu, s, government, failed, to, regularly, maintain, the, plants, and, their, capacity, declined, until, the, 1995, formation, of, the, southern, african, power, pool, created, a, multi, national, power, grid, and, plant, maintenance, program, states, with, an, abundance, of, hydropower, such, as, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, ghana, frequently, sell, excess, power, to, neighboring, countries, foreign, actors, such, as, chinese, hydropower, companies, have, proposed, a, significant, amount, of, new, hydropower, projects, in, africa, and, already, funded, and, consulted, on, many, others, in, countries, like, mozambique, and, ghana, small, hydropower, also, played, an, important, role, in, early, 20th, century, electrification, across, africa, in, south, africa, small, turbines, powered, gold, mines, and, the, first, electric, railway, in, the, 1890s, and, zimbabwean, farmers, installed, small, hydropower, stations, in, the, 1930s, while, interest, faded, as, national, grids, improved, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, 21st, century, national, governments, in, countries, including, south, africa, and, mozambique, as, well, as, ngos, serving, countries, like, zimbabwe, have, begun, re, exploring, small, scale, hydropower, to, diversify, power, sources, and, improve, rural, electrification, in, the, early, 20th, century, two, major, factors, motivated, the, expansion, of, hydropower, in, europe, in, the, northern, countries, of, norway, and, sweden, high, rainfall, and, mountains, proved, exceptional, resources, for, abundant, hydropower, and, in, the, south, coal, shortages, pushed, governments, and, utility, companies, to, seek, alternative, power, sources, early, on, switzerland, dammed, the, alpine, rivers, and, the, swiss, rhine, creating, along, with, italy, and, scandinavia, a, southern, europe, hydropower, race, in, italy, s, po, valley, the, main, 20th, century, transition, was, not, the, creation, of, hydropower, but, the, transition, from, mechanical, to, electrical, hydropower, 12, 000, watermills, churned, in, the, po, watershed, in, the, 1890s, but, the, first, commercial, hydroelectric, plant, completed, in, 1898, signaled, the, end, of, the, mechanical, reign, these, new, large, plants, moved, power, away, from, rural, mountainous, areas, to, urban, centers, in, the, lower, plain, italy, prioritized, early, near, nationwide, electrification, almost, entirely, from, hydropower, which, powered, their, rise, as, a, dominant, european, and, imperial, force, however, they, failed, to, reach, any, conclusive, standard, for, determining, water, rights, before, wwi, modern, german, hydropower, dam, construction, built, off, a, history, of, small, dams, powering, mines, and, mills, going, back, to, the, 15th, century, some, parts, of, germany, industry, even, relied, more, on, waterwheels, than, steam, until, the, 1870s, the, german, government, did, not, set, out, building, large, dams, such, as, the, prewar, urft, mohne, and, eder, dams, to, expand, hydropower, they, mostly, wanted, to, reduce, flooding, and, improve, navigation, however, hydropower, quickly, emerged, as, an, added, bonus, for, all, these, dams, especially, in, the, coal, poor, south, bavaria, even, achieved, a, statewide, power, grid, by, damming, the, walchensee, in, 1924, inspired, in, part, by, loss, of, coal, reserves, after, wwi, hydropower, became, a, symbol, of, regional, pride, and, distaste, for, northern, coal, barons, although, the, north, also, held, strong, enthusiasm, for, hydropower, dam, building, rapidly, increased, after, wwii, this, time, with, the, express, purpose, of, increasing, hydropower, however, conflict, accompanied, the, dam, building, and, spread, of, hydropower, agrarian, interests, suffered, from, decreased, irrigation, small, mills, lost, water, flow, and, different, interest, groups, fought, over, where, dams, should, be, located, controlling, who, benefited, and, whose, homes, they, drowned, this, is, also, the, period, when, water, mills, started, to, spread, outside, the, former, empire, according, to, cedrenus, historiarum, compendium, a, certain, metrodoros, who, went, to, india, in, c, a, d, 325, constructed, water, mills, and, baths, unknown, among, them, till, then
