a, submarine, or, sub, is, a, watercraft, capable, of, independent, operation, underwater, it, differs, from, a, submersible, which, has, more, limited, underwater, capability, the, term, submarine, is, also, sometimes, used, historically, or, informally, to, refer, to, remotely, operated, vehicles, and, robots, or, to, medium, sized, or, smaller, vessels, such, as, the, midget, submarine, and, the, wet, sub, submarines, are, referred, to, as, boats, rather, than, ships, regardless, of, their, size, although, experimental, submarines, had, been, built, earlier, submarine, design, took, off, during, the, 19th, century, and, submarines, were, adopted, by, several, navies, they, were, first, used, widely, during, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, and, are, now, used, in, many, navies, large, and, small, their, military, uses, include, attacking, enemy, surface, ships, merchant, and, military, or, other, submarines, aircraft, carrier, protection, blockade, running, nuclear, deterrence, stealth, operations, in, denied, areas, when, gathering, intelligence, and, doing, reconnaissance, denying, or, influencing, enemy, movements, conventional, land, attacks, for, example, launching, a, cruise, missile, and, covert, insertion, of, frogmen, or, special, forces, their, civilian, uses, include, marine, science, salvage, exploration, and, facility, inspection, and, maintenance, submarines, can, be, modified, for, specialized, functions, such, as, search, and, rescue, missions, and, undersea, cable, repair, they, are, also, used, in, the, tourism, industry, and, in, undersea, archaeology, modern, deep, diving, submarines, derive, from, the, bathyscaphe, which, evolved, from, the, diving, bell, most, large, submarines, consist, of, a, cylindrical, body, with, hemispherical, or, conical, ends, and, a, vertical, structure, usually, located, amidships, which, houses, communications, and, sensing, devices, as, well, as, periscopes, in, modern, submarines, this, structure, is, called, the, sail, in, american, usage, and, fin, in, european, usage, a, feature, of, earlier, designs, was, the, conning, tower, a, separate, pressure, hull, above, the, main, body, of, the, boat, that, enabled, the, use, of, shorter, periscopes, there, is, a, propeller, or, pump, jet, at, the, rear, and, various, hydrodynamic, control, fins, smaller, deep, diving, and, specialty, submarines, may, deviate, significantly, from, this, traditional, design, submarines, dive, and, resurface, by, using, diving, planes, and, by, changing, the, amount, of, water, and, air, in, ballast, tanks, to, affect, their, buoyancy, submarines, encompass, a, wide, range, of, types, and, capabilities, they, range, from, small, autonomous, examples, such, as, one, or, two, person, subs, that, operate, for, a, few, hours, to, vessels, that, can, remain, submerged, for, six, months, such, as, the, russian, typhoon, class, the, biggest, submarines, ever, built, submarines, can, work, at, depths, that, are, greater, than, what, is, practicable, or, even, survivable, for, human, divers, the, word, submarine, means, underwater, or, under, sea, as, in, submarine, canyon, submarine, pipeline, though, as, a, noun, it, generally, refers, to, a, vessel, that, can, travel, underwater, the, term, is, a, contraction, of, submarine, boat, and, occurs, as, such, in, several, languages, e, g, french, sous, marin, and, spanish, submarino, although, others, retain, the, original, term, such, as, dutch, onderzeeboot, german, unterseeboot, swedish, undervattensb, t, and, russian, podvodnaya, lodka, all, of, which, mean, submarine, boat, by, naval, tradition, submarines, are, usually, referred, to, as, boats, rather, than, as, ships, regardless, of, their, size, although, referred, to, informally, as, boats, u, s, submarines, employ, the, designation, uss, united, states, ship, at, the, beginning, of, their, names, such, as, uss, alabama, in, the, royal, navy, the, designation, hms, can, refer, to, his, majesty, s, ship, or, his, majesty, s, submarine, though, the, latter, is, sometimes, rendered, hms, m, and, submarines, are, generally, referred, to, as, boats, rather, than, ships, according, to, a, report, in, opusculum, taisnieri, published, in, 1562, two, greeks, submerged, and, surfaced, in, the, river, tagus, near, the, city, of, toledo, several, times, in, the, presence, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, without, getting, wet, and, with, the, flame, they, carried, in, their, hands, still, alight, in, 1578, the, english, mathematician, william, bourne, recorded, in, his, book, inventions, or, devises, one, of, the, first, plans, for, an, underwater, navigation, vehicle, a, few, years, later, the, scottish, mathematician, and, theologian, john, napier, wrote, in, his, secret, inventions, 1596, that, these, inventions, besides, devises, of, sayling, under, water, with, divers, other, devises, and, strategems, for, harming, of, the, enemyes, by, the, grace, of, god, and, worke, of, expert, craftsmen, i, hope, to, perform, it, is, unclear, whether, he, carried, out, his, idea, jer, nimo, de, ayanz, y, beaumont, 1553, 1613, created, detailed, designs, for, two, types, of, air, renovated, submersible, vehicles, they, were, equipped, with, oars, autonomous, floating, snorkels, worked, by, inner, pumps, portholes, and, gloves, used, for, the, crew, to, manipulate, underwater, objects, ayanaz, planned, to, use, them, for, warfare, using, them, to, approach, enemy, ships, undetected, and, set, up, timed, gunpowder, charges, on, their, hulls, the, first, submersible, of, whose, construction, there, exists, reliable, information, was, designed, and, built, in, 1620, by, cornelis, drebbel, a, dutchman, in, the, service, of, james, i, of, england, it, was, propelled, by, means, of, oars, by, the, mid, 18th, century, over, a, dozen, patents, for, submarines, submersible, boats, had, been, granted, in, england, in, 1747, nathaniel, symons, patented, and, built, the, first, known, working, example, of, the, use, of, a, ballast, tank, for, submersion, his, design, used, leather, bags, that, could, fill, with, water, to, submerge, the, craft, a, mechanism, was, used, to, twist, the, water, out, of, the, bags, and, cause, the, boat, to, resurface, in, 1749, the, gentlemen, s, magazine, reported, that, a, similar, design, had, initially, been, proposed, by, giovanni, borelli, in, 1680, further, design, improvement, stagnated, for, over, a, century, until, application, of, new, technologies, for, propulsion, and, stability, the, first, military, submersible, was, turtle, 1775, a, hand, powered, acorn, shaped, device, designed, by, the, american, david, bushnell, to, accommodate, a, single, person, it, was, the, first, verified, submarine, capable, of, independent, underwater, operation, and, movement, and, the, first, to, use, screws, for, propulsion, in, 1800, france, built, nautilus, a, human, powered, submarine, designed, by, american, robert, fulton, they, gave, up, on, the, experiment, in, 1804, as, did, the, british, when, they, reconsidered, fulton, s, submarine, design, in, 1850, wilhelm, bauer, s, brandtaucher, was, built, in, germany, it, remains, the, oldest, known, surviving, submarine, in, the, world, in, 1864, late, in, the, american, civil, war, the, confederate, navy, s, h, l, hunley, became, the, first, military, submarine, to, sink, an, enemy, vessel, the, union, sloop, of, war, uss, housatonic, using, a, gun, powder, filled, keg, on, a, spar, as, a, torpedo, charge, the, hunley, also, sank, the, explosion, s, shock, waves, may, have, killed, its, crew, instantly, preventing, them, from, pumping, the, bilge, or, propelling, the, submarine, in, 1866, sub, marine, explorer, was, the, first, submarine, to, successfully, dive, cruise, underwater, and, resurface, under, the, crew, s, control, the, design, by, german, american, julius, h, kroehl, in, german, kr, hl, incorporated, elements, that, are, still, used, in, modern, submarines, in, 1866, flach, was, built, at, the, chilean, government, s, request, by, karl, flach, a, german, engineer, and, immigrant, it, was, the, fifth, submarine, built, in, the, world, and, along, with, a, second, submarine, was, intended, to, defend, the, port, of, valparaiso, against, attack, by, the, spanish, navy, during, the, chincha, islands, war, submarines, could, not, be, put, into, widespread, or, routine, service, use, by, navies, until, suitable, engines, were, developed, the, era, from, 1863, to, 1904, marked, a, pivotal, time, in, submarine, development, and, several, important, technologies, appeared, a, number, of, nations, built, and, used, submarines, diesel, electric, propulsion, became, the, dominant, power, system, and, equipment, such, as, the, periscope, became, standardized, countries, conducted, many, experiments, on, effective, tactics, and, weapons, for, submarines, which, led, to, their, large, impact, in, world, war, i, the, first, submarine, not, relying, on, human, power, for, propulsion, was, the, french, plongeur, diver, launched, in, 1863, which, used, compressed, air, at, 1, 200, kpa, 180, psi, narc, s, monturiol, designed, the, first, air, independent, and, combustion, powered, submarine, ict, neo, ii, which, was, launched, in, barcelona, spain, in, 1864, the, submarine, became, feasible, as, potential, weapon, with, the, development, of, the, whitehead, torpedo, designed, in, 1866, by, british, engineer, robert, whitehead, the, first, practical, self, propelled, or, locomotive, torpedo, the, spar, torpedo, that, had, been, developed, earlier, by, the, confederate, states, navy, was, considered, to, be, impracticable, as, it, was, believed, to, have, sunk, both, its, intended, target, and, h, l, hunley, the, submarine, that, deployed, it, the, irish, inventor, john, philip, holland, built, a, model, submarine, in, 1876, and, in, 1878, demonstrated, the, holland, i, prototype, this, was, followed, by, a, number, of, unsuccessful, designs, in, 1896, he, designed, the, holland, type, vi, submarine, which, used, internal, combustion, engine, power, on, the, surface, and, electric, battery, power, underwater, launched, on, 17, may, 1897, at, navy, lt, lewis, nixon, s, crescent, shipyard, in, elizabeth, new, jersey, holland, vi, was, purchased, by, the, united, states, navy, on, 11, april, 1900, becoming, the, navy, s, first, commissioned, submarine, christened, uss, holland, discussions, between, the, english, clergyman, and, inventor, george, garrett, and, the, swedish, industrialist, thorsten, nordenfelt, led, to, the, first, practical, steam, powered, submarines, armed, with, torpedoes, and, ready, for, military, use, the, first, was, nordenfelt, i, a, 56, tonne, 19, 5, metre, 64, ft, vessel, similar, to, garrett, s, ill, fated, resurgam, 1879, with, a, range, of, 240, kilometres, 130, nmi, 150, mi, armed, with, a, single, torpedo, in, 1885, a, reliable, means, of, propulsion, for, the, submerged, vessel, was, only, made, possible, in, the, 1880s, with, the, advent, of, the, necessary, electric, battery, technology, the, first, electrically, powered, boats, were, built, by, isaac, peral, y, caballero, in, spain, who, built, peral, dupuy, de, l, me, who, built, gymnote, and, gustave, z, d, who, built, sir, ne, in, france, and, james, franklin, waddington, who, built, porpoise, in, england, peral, s, design, featured, torpedoes, and, other, systems, that, later, became, standard, in, submarines, commissioned, in, june, 1900, the, french, steam, and, electric, narval, employed, the, now, typical, double, hull, design, with, a, pressure, hull, inside, the, outer, shell, these, 200, ton, ships, had, a, range, of, over, 160, km, 100, mi, underwater, the, french, submarine, aigrette, in, 1904, further, improved, the, concept, by, using, a, diesel, rather, than, a, gasoline, engine, for, surface, power, large, numbers, of, these, submarines, were, built, with, seventy, six, completed, before, 1914, the, royal, navy, commissioned, five, holland, class, submarines, from, vickers, barrow, in, furness, under, licence, from, the, holland, torpedo, boat, company, from, 1901, to, 1903, construction, of, the, boats, took, longer, than, anticipated, with, the, first, only, ready, for, a, diving, trial, at, sea, on, 6, april, 1902, although, the, design, had, been, purchased, entirely, from, the, us, company, the, actual, design, used, was, an, untested, improvement, to, the, original, holland, design, using, a, new, 180, horsepower, 130, kw, petrol, engine, these, types, of, submarines, were, first, used, during, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 05, due, to, the, blockade, at, port, arthur, the, russians, sent, their, submarines, to, vladivostok, where, by, 1, january, 1905, there, were, seven, boats, enough, to, create, the, world, s, first, operational, submarine, fleet, the, new, submarine, fleet, began, patrols, on, 14, february, usually, lasting, for, about, 24, hours, each, the, first, confrontation, with, japanese, warships, occurred, on, 29, april, 1905, when, the, russian, submarine, som, was, fired, upon, by, japanese, torpedo, boats, but, then, withdrew, military, submarines, first, made, a, significant, impact, in, world, war, i, forces, such, as, the, u, boats, of, germany, saw, action, in, the, first, battle, of, the, atlantic, and, were, responsible, for, sinking, rms, lusitania, which, was, sunk, as, a, result, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, and, is, often, cited, among, the, reasons, for, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, germany, had, only, twenty, submarines, available, for, combat, although, these, included, vessels, of, the, diesel, engined, u, 19, class, which, had, a, sufficient, range, of, 5, 000, miles, 8, 000, km, and, speed, of, 8, knots, 15, km, h, to, allow, them, to, operate, effectively, around, the, entire, british, coast, by, contrast, the, royal, navy, had, a, total, of, 74, submarines, though, of, mixed, effectiveness, in, august, 1914, a, flotilla, of, ten, u, boats, sailed, from, their, base, in, heligoland, to, attack, royal, navy, warships, in, the, north, sea, in, the, first, submarine, war, patrol, in, history, the, u, boats, ability, to, function, as, practical, war, machines, relied, on, new, tactics, their, numbers, and, submarine, technologies, such, as, combination, diesel, electric, power, system, developed, in, the, preceding, years, more, submersibles, than, true, submarines, u, boats, operated, primarily, on, the, surface, using, regular, engines, submerging, occasionally, to, attack, under, battery, power, they, were, roughly, triangular, in, cross, section, with, a, distinct, keel, to, control, rolling, while, surfaced, and, a, distinct, bow, during, world, war, i, more, than, 5, 000, allied, ships, were, sunk, by, u, boats, the, british, responded, to, the, german, developments, in, submarine, technology, with, the, creation, of, the, k, class, submarines, however, these, submarines, were, notoriously, dangerous, to, operate, due, to, their, various, design, flaws, and, poor, maneuverability, during, world, war, ii, germany, used, submarines, to, devastating, effect, in, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, where, it, attempted, to, cut, britain, s, supply, routes, by, sinking, more, merchant, ships, than, britain, could, replace, these, merchant, ships, were, vital, to, supply, britain, s, population, with, food, industry, with, raw, material, and, armed, forces, with, fuel, and, armaments, although, the, u, boats, had, been, updated, in, the, interwar, years, the, major, innovation, was, improved, communications, encrypted, using, the, enigma, cipher, machine, this, allowed, for, mass, attack, naval, tactics, rudeltaktik, commonly, known, as, wolfpack, which, ultimately, ceased, to, be, effective, when, the, u, boat, s, enigma, was, cracked, by, the, end, of, the, war, almost, 3, 000, allied, ships, 175, warships, 2, 825, merchantmen, had, been, sunk, by, u, boats, although, successful, early, in, the, war, germany, s, u, boat, fleet, suffered, heavy, casualties, losing, 793, u, boats, and, about, 28, 000, submariners, out, of, 41, 000, a, casualty, rate, of, about, 70, the, imperial, japanese, navy, operated, the, most, varied, fleet, of, submarines, of, any, navy, including, kaiten, crewed, torpedoes, midget, submarines, type, a, ko, hyoteki, and, kairyu, classes, medium, range, submarines, purpose, built, supply, submarines, and, long, range, fleet, submarines, they, also, had, submarines, with, the, highest, submerged, speeds, during, world, war, ii, i, 201, class, submarines, and, submarines, that, could, carry, multiple, aircraft, i, 400, class, submarines, they, were, also, equipped, with, one, of, the, most, advanced, torpedoes, of, the, conflict, the, oxygen, propelled, type, 95, nevertheless, despite, their, technical, prowess, japan, chose, to, use, its, submarines, for, fleet, warfare, and, consequently, were, relatively, unsuccessful, as, warships, were, fast, maneuverable, and, well, defended, compared, to, merchant, ships, the, submarine, force, was, the, most, effective, anti, ship, weapon, in, the, american, arsenal, submarines, though, only, about, 2, percent, of, the, u, s, navy, destroyed, over, 30, percent, of, the, japanese, navy, including, 8, aircraft, carriers, 1, battleship, and, 11, cruisers, us, submarines, also, destroyed, over, 60, percent, of, the, japanese, merchant, fleet, crippling, japan, s, ability, to, supply, its, military, forces, and, industrial, war, effort, allied, submarines, in, the, pacific, war, destroyed, more, japanese, shipping, than, all, other, weapons, combined, this, feat, was, considerably, aided, by, the, imperial, japanese, navy, s, failure, to, provide, adequate, escort, forces, for, the, nation, s, merchant, fleet, during, world, war, ii, 314, submarines, served, in, the, us, navy, of, which, nearly, 260, were, deployed, to, the, pacific, when, the, japanese, attacked, hawaii, in, december, 1941, 111, boats, were, in, commission, 203, submarines, from, the, gato, balao, and, tench, classes, were, commissioned, during, the, war, during, the, war, 52, us, submarines, were, lost, to, all, causes, with, 48, directly, due, to, hostilities, us, submarines, sank, 1, 560, enemy, vessels, a, total, tonnage, of, 5, 3, million, tons, 55, of, the, total, sunk, the, royal, navy, submarine, service, was, used, primarily, in, the, classic, axis, blockade, its, major, operating, areas, were, around, norway, in, the, mediterranean, against, the, axis, supply, routes, to, north, africa, and, in, the, far, east, in, that, war, british, submarines, sank, 2, million, tons, of, enemy, shipping, and, 57, major, warships, the, latter, including, 35, submarines, among, these, is, the, only, documented, instance, of, a, submarine, sinking, another, submarine, while, both, were, submerged, this, occurred, when, hms, venturer, engaged, u, 864, the, venturer, crew, manually, computed, a, successful, firing, solution, against, a, three, dimensionally, maneuvering, target, using, techniques, which, became, the, basis, of, modern, torpedo, computer, targeting, systems, seventy, four, british, submarines, were, lost, the, majority, forty, two, in, the, mediterranean, the, first, launch, of, a, cruise, missile, ssm, n, 8, regulus, from, a, submarine, occurred, in, july, 1953, from, the, deck, of, uss, tunny, a, world, war, ii, fleet, boat, modified, to, carry, the, missile, with, a, nuclear, warhead, tunny, and, its, sister, boat, barbero, were, the, united, states, first, nuclear, deterrent, patrol, submarines, in, the, 1950s, nuclear, power, partially, replaced, diesel, electric, propulsion, equipment, was, also, developed, to, extract, oxygen, from, sea, water, these, two, innovations, gave, submarines, the, ability, to, remain, submerged, for, weeks, or, months, most, of, the, naval, submarines, built, since, that, time, in, the, us, the, soviet, union, now, russia, the, uk, and, france, have, been, powered, by, a, nuclear, reactor, in, 1959, 1960, the, first, ballistic, missile, submarines, were, put, into, service, by, both, the, united, states, george, washington, class, and, the, soviet, union, golf, class, as, part, of, the, cold, war, nuclear, deterrent, strategy, during, the, cold, war, the, us, and, the, soviet, union, maintained, large, submarine, fleets, that, engaged, in, cat, and, mouse, games, the, soviet, union, lost, at, least, four, submarines, during, this, period, k, 129, was, lost, in, 1968, a, part, of, which, the, cia, retrieved, from, the, ocean, floor, with, the, howard, hughes, designed, ship, glomar, explorer, k, 8, in, 1970, k, 219, in, 1986, and, komsomolets, in, 1989, which, held, a, depth, record, among, military, submarines, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, many, other, soviet, subs, such, as, k, 19, the, first, soviet, nuclear, submarine, and, the, first, soviet, sub, to, reach, the, north, pole, were, badly, damaged, by, fire, or, radiation, leaks, the, us, lost, two, nuclear, submarines, during, this, time, uss, thresher, due, to, equipment, failure, during, a, test, dive, while, at, its, operational, limit, and, uss, scorpion, due, to, unknown, causes, during, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, the, pakistan, navy, s, hangor, sank, the, indian, frigate, ins, khukri, this, was, the, first, sinking, by, a, submarine, since, world, war, ii, during, the, same, war, ghazi, a, tench, class, submarine, on, loan, to, pakistan, from, the, us, was, sunk, by, the, indian, navy, it, was, the, first, submarine, combat, loss, since, world, war, ii, in, 1982, during, the, falklands, war, the, argentine, cruiser, general, belgrano, was, sunk, by, the, british, submarine, hms, conqueror, the, first, sinking, by, a, nuclear, powered, submarine, in, war, some, weeks, later, on, 16, june, during, the, lebanon, war, an, unnamed, israeli, submarine, torpedoed, and, sank, the, lebanese, coaster, transit, which, was, carrying, 56, palestinian, refugees, to, cyprus, in, the, belief, that, the, vessel, was, evacuating, anti, israeli, militias, the, ship, was, hit, by, two, torpedoes, managed, to, run, aground, but, eventually, sank, there, were, 25, dead, including, her, captain, the, israeli, navy, disclosed, the, incident, in, november, 2018, before, and, during, world, war, ii, the, primary, role, of, the, submarine, was, anti, surface, ship, warfare, submarines, would, attack, either, on, the, surface, using, deck, guns, or, submerged, using, torpedoes, they, were, particularly, effective, in, sinking, allied, transatlantic, shipping, in, both, world, wars, and, in, disrupting, japanese, supply, routes, and, naval, operations, in, the, pacific, in, world, war, ii, mine, laying, submarines, were, developed, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, the, facility, was, used, in, both, world, wars, submarines, were, also, used, for, inserting, and, removing, covert, agents, and, military, forces, in, special, operations, for, intelligence, gathering, and, to, rescue, aircrew, during, air, attacks, on, islands, where, the, airmen, would, be, told, of, safe, places, to, crash, land, so, the, submarines, could, rescue, them, submarines, could, carry, cargo, through, hostile, waters, or, act, as, supply, vessels, for, other, submarines, submarines, could, usually, locate, and, attack, other, submarines, only, on, the, surface, although, hms, venturer, managed, to, sink, u, 864, with, a, four, torpedo, spread, while, both, were, submerged, the, british, developed, a, specialized, anti, submarine, submarine, in, wwi, the, r, class, after, wwii, with, the, development, of, the, homing, torpedo, better, sonar, systems, and, nuclear, propulsion, submarines, also, became, able, to, hunt, each, other, effectively, the, development, of, submarine, launched, ballistic, missile, and, submarine, launched, cruise, missiles, gave, submarines, a, substantial, and, long, ranged, ability, to, attack, both, land, and, sea, targets, with, a, variety, of, weapons, ranging, from, cluster, bombs, to, nuclear, weapons, the, primary, defense, of, a, submarine, lies, in, its, ability, to, remain, concealed, in, the, depths, of, the, ocean, early, submarines, could, be, detected, by, the, sound, they, made, water, is, an, excellent, conductor, of, sound, much, better, than, air, and, submarines, can, detect, and, track, comparatively, noisy, surface, ships, from, long, distances, modern, submarines, are, built, with, an, emphasis, on, stealth, advanced, propeller, designs, extensive, sound, reducing, insulation, and, special, machinery, help, a, submarine, remain, as, quiet, as, ambient, ocean, noise, making, them, difficult, to, detect, it, takes, specialized, technology, to, find, and, attack, modern, submarines, active, sonar, uses, the, reflection, of, sound, emitted, from, the, search, equipment, to, detect, submarines, it, has, been, used, since, wwii, by, surface, ships, submarines, and, aircraft, via, dropped, buoys, and, helicopter, dipping, arrays, but, it, reveals, the, emitter, s, position, and, is, susceptible, to, counter, measures, a, concealed, military, submarine, is, a, real, threat, and, because, of, its, stealth, can, force, an, enemy, navy, to, waste, resources, searching, large, areas, of, ocean, and, protecting, ships, against, attack, this, advantage, was, vividly, demonstrated, in, the, 1982, falklands, war, when, the, british, nuclear, powered, submarine, hms, conqueror, sank, the, argentine, cruiser, general, belgrano, after, the, sinking, the, argentine, navy, recognized, that, they, had, no, effective, defense, against, submarine, attack, and, the, argentine, surface, fleet, withdrew, to, port, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, an, argentine, submarine, remained, at, sea, however, although, the, majority, of, the, world, s, submarines, are, military, there, are, some, civilian, submarines, which, are, used, for, tourism, exploration, oil, and, gas, platform, inspections, and, pipeline, surveys, some, are, also, used, in, illegal, activities, the, submarine, voyage, ride, opened, at, disneyland, in, 1959, but, although, it, ran, under, water, it, was, not, a, true, submarine, as, it, ran, on, tracks, and, was, open, to, the, atmosphere, the, first, tourist, submarine, was, auguste, piccard, which, went, into, service, in, 1964, at, expo64, by, 1997, there, were, 45, tourist, submarines, operating, around, the, world, submarines, with, a, crush, depth, in, the, range, of, 400, 500, feet, 120, 150, m, are, operated, in, several, areas, worldwide, typically, with, bottom, depths, around, 100, to, 120, feet, 30, to, 37, m, with, a, carrying, capacity, of, 50, to, 100, passengers, in, a, typical, operation, a, surface, vessel, carries, passengers, to, an, offshore, operating, area, and, loads, them, into, the, submarine, the, submarine, then, visits, underwater, points, of, interest, such, as, natural, or, artificial, reef, structures, to, surface, safely, without, danger, of, collision, the, location, of, the, submarine, is, marked, with, an, air, release, and, movement, to, the, surface, is, coordinated, by, an, observer, in, a, support, craft, a, recent, development, is, the, deployment, of, so, called, narco, submarines, by, south, american, drug, smugglers, to, evade, law, enforcement, detection, although, they, occasionally, deploy, true, submarines, most, are, self, propelled, semi, submersibles, where, a, portion, of, the, craft, remains, above, water, at, all, times, in, september, 2011, colombian, authorities, seized, a, 16, meter, long, submersible, that, could, hold, a, crew, of, 5, costing, about, 2, million, the, vessel, belonged, to, farc, rebels, and, had, the, capacity, to, carry, at, least, 7, tonnes, of, drugs, all, surface, ships, as, well, as, surfaced, submarines, are, in, a, positively, buoyant, condition, weighing, less, than, the, volume, of, water, they, would, displace, if, fully, submerged, to, submerge, hydrostatically, a, ship, must, have, negative, buoyancy, either, by, increasing, its, own, weight, or, decreasing, its, displacement, of, water, to, control, their, displacement, and, weight, submarines, have, ballast, tanks, which, can, hold, varying, amounts, of, water, and, air, for, general, submersion, or, surfacing, submarines, use, the, main, ballast, tanks, mbts, which, are, ambient, pressure, tanks, filled, with, water, to, submerge, or, with, air, to, surface, while, submerged, mbts, generally, remain, flooded, which, simplifies, their, design, and, on, many, submarines, these, tanks, are, a, section, of, the, space, between, the, light, hull, and, the, pressure, hull, for, more, precise, control, of, depth, submarines, use, smaller, depth, control, tanks, dcts, also, called, hard, tanks, due, to, their, ability, to, withstand, higher, pressure, or, trim, tanks, these, are, variable, buoyancy, pressure, vessels, a, type, of, buoyancy, control, device, the, amount, of, water, in, depth, control, tanks, can, be, adjusted, to, hydrostatically, change, depth, or, to, maintain, a, constant, depth, as, outside, conditions, mainly, water, density, change, depth, control, tanks, may, be, located, either, near, the, submarine, s, center, of, gravity, to, minimise, the, effect, on, trim, or, separated, along, the, length, of, the, hull, so, they, can, also, be, used, to, adjust, static, trim, by, transfer, of, water, between, them, when, submerged, the, water, pressure, on, a, submarine, s, hull, can, reach, 4, mpa, 580, psi, for, steel, submarines, and, up, to, 10, mpa, 1, 500, psi, for, titanium, submarines, like, k, 278, komsomolets, while, interior, pressure, remains, relatively, unchanged, this, difference, results, in, hull, compression, which, decreases, displacement, water, density, also, marginally, increases, with, depth, as, the, salinity, and, pressure, are, higher, this, change, in, density, incompletely, compensates, for, hull, compression, so, buoyancy, decreases, as, depth, increases, a, submerged, submarine, is, in, an, unstable, equilibrium, having, a, tendency, to, either, sink, or, float, to, the, surface, keeping, a, constant, depth, requires, continual, operation, of, either, the, depth, control, tanks, or, control, surfaces, submarines, in, a, neutral, buoyancy, condition, are, not, intrinsically, trim, stable, to, maintain, desired, longitudinal, trim, submarines, use, forward, and, aft, trim, tanks, pumps, move, water, between, the, tanks, changing, weight, distribution, and, pitching, the, sub, up, or, down, a, similar, system, may, be, used, to, maintain, transverse, trim, the, hydrostatic, effect, of, variable, ballast, tanks, is, not, the, only, way, to, control, the, submarine, underwater, hydrodynamic, maneuvering, is, done, by, several, control, surfaces, collectively, known, as, diving, planes, or, hydroplanes, which, can, be, moved, to, create, hydrodynamic, forces, when, a, submarine, moves, longitudinally, at, sufficient, speed, in, the, classic, cruciform, stern, configuration, the, horizontal, stern, planes, serve, the, same, purpose, as, the, trim, tanks, controlling, the, trim, most, submarines, additionally, have, forward, horizontal, planes, normally, placed, on, the, bow, until, the, 1960s, but, often, on, the, sail, on, later, designs, where, they, are, closer, to, the, center, of, gravity, and, can, control, depth, with, less, effect, on, the, trim, an, obvious, way, to, configure, the, control, surfaces, at, the, stern, of, a, submarine, is, to, use, vertical, planes, to, control, yaw, and, horizontal, planes, to, control, pitch, which, gives, them, the, shape, of, a, cross, when, seen, from, astern, of, the, vessel, in, this, configuration, which, long, remained, the, dominant, one, the, horizontal, planes, are, used, to, control, the, trim, and, depth, and, the, vertical, planes, to, control, sideways, maneuvers, like, the, rudder, of, a, surface, ship, alternatively, the, rear, control, surfaces, can, be, combined, into, what, has, become, known, as, an, x, stern, or, an, x, rudder, although, less, intuitive, such, a, configuration, has, turned, out, to, have, several, advantages, over, the, traditional, cruciform, arrangement, first, it, improves, maneuverability, horizontally, as, well, as, vertically, second, the, control, surfaces, are, less, likely, to, get, damaged, when, landing, on, or, departing, from, the, seabed, as, well, as, when, mooring, and, unmooring, alongside, finally, it, is, safer, in, that, one, of, the, two, diagonal, lines, can, counteract, the, other, with, respect, to, vertical, as, well, as, horizontal, motion, if, one, of, them, accidentally, gets, stuck, the, x, stern, was, first, tried, in, practice, in, the, early, 1960s, on, the, uss, albacore, an, experimental, submarine, of, the, us, navy, while, the, arrangement, was, found, to, be, advantageous, it, was, nevertheless, not, used, on, us, production, submarines, that, followed, due, to, the, fact, that, it, requires, the, use, of, a, computer, to, manipulate, the, control, surfaces, to, the, desired, effect, instead, the, first, to, use, an, x, stern, in, standard, operations, was, the, swedish, navy, with, its, sj, ormen, class, the, lead, submarine, of, which, was, launched, in, 1967, before, the, albacore, had, even, finished, her, test, runs, since, it, turned, out, to, work, very, well, in, practice, all, subsequent, classes, of, swedish, submarines, n, cken, v, sterg, tland, gotland, and, blekinge, class, have, or, will, come, with, an, x, rudder, the, kockums, shipyard, responsible, for, the, design, of, the, x, stern, on, swedish, submarines, eventually, exported, it, to, australia, with, the, collins, class, as, well, as, to, japan, with, the, s, ry, class, with, the, introduction, of, the, type, 212, the, german, and, italian, navies, came, to, feature, it, as, well, the, us, navy, with, its, columbia, class, the, british, navy, with, its, dreadnought, class, and, the, french, navy, with, its, barracuda, class, are, all, about, to, join, the, x, stern, family, hence, as, judged, by, the, situation, in, the, early, 2020s, the, x, stern, is, about, to, become, the, dominant, technology, when, a, submarine, performs, an, emergency, surfacing, all, depth, and, trim, control, methods, are, used, simultaneously, together, with, propelling, the, boat, upwards, such, surfacing, is, very, quick, so, the, vessel, may, even, partially, jump, out, of, the, water, potentially, damaging, submarine, systems, modern, submarines, are, cigar, shaped, this, design, also, used, in, very, early, submarines, is, sometimes, called, a, teardrop, hull, it, reduces, hydrodynamic, drag, when, the, sub, is, submerged, but, decreases, the, sea, keeping, capabilities, and, increases, drag, while, surfaced, since, the, limitations, of, the, propulsion, systems, of, early, submarines, forced, them, to, operate, surfaced, most, of, the, time, their, hull, designs, were, a, compromise, because, of, the, slow, submerged, speeds, of, those, subs, usually, well, below, 10, kt, 18, km, h, the, increased, drag, for, underwater, travel, was, acceptable, late, in, world, war, ii, when, technology, allowed, faster, and, longer, submerged, operation, and, increased, aircraft, surveillance, forced, submarines, to, stay, submerged, hull, designs, became, teardrop, shaped, again, to, reduce, drag, and, noise, uss, albacore, agss, 569, was, a, unique, research, submarine, that, pioneered, the, american, version, of, the, teardrop, hull, form, sometimes, referred, to, as, an, albacore, hull, of, modern, submarines, on, modern, military, submarines, the, outer, hull, is, covered, with, a, layer, of, sound, absorbing, rubber, or, anechoic, plating, to, reduce, detection, the, occupied, pressure, hulls, of, deep, diving, submarines, such, as, dsv, alvin, are, spherical, instead, of, cylindrical, this, allows, a, more, even, distribution, of, stress, and, efficient, use, of, materials, to, withstand, external, pressure, as, it, gives, the, most, internal, volume, for, structural, weight, and, is, the, most, efficient, shape, to, avoid, buckling, instability, in, compression, a, frame, is, usually, affixed, to, the, outside, of, the, pressure, hull, providing, attachment, for, ballast, and, trim, systems, scientific, instrumentation, battery, packs, syntactic, flotation, foam, and, lighting, a, raised, tower, on, top, of, a, standard, submarine, accommodates, the, periscope, and, electronics, masts, which, can, include, radio, radar, electronic, warfare, and, other, systems, it, might, also, include, a, snorkel, mast, in, many, early, classes, of, submarines, see, history, the, control, room, or, conn, was, located, inside, this, tower, which, was, known, as, the, conning, tower, since, then, the, conn, has, been, located, within, the, hull, of, the, submarine, and, the, tower, is, now, called, the, sail, or, fin, the, conn, is, distinct, from, the, bridge, a, small, open, platform, in, the, top, of, the, sail, used, for, observation, during, surface, operation, bathtubs, are, related, to, conning, towers, but, are, used, on, smaller, submarines, the, bathtub, is, a, metal, cylinder, surrounding, the, hatch, that, prevents, waves, from, breaking, directly, into, the, cabin, it, is, needed, because, surfaced, submarines, have, limited, freeboard, that, is, they, lie, low, in, the, water, bathtubs, help, prevent, swamping, the, vessel, modern, submarines, and, submersibles, usually, have, as, did, the, earliest, models, a, single, hull, large, submarines, generally, have, an, additional, hull, or, hull, sections, outside, this, external, hull, which, actually, forms, the, shape, of, submarine, is, called, the, outer, hull, casing, in, the, royal, navy, or, light, hull, as, it, does, not, have, to, withstand, a, pressure, difference, inside, the, outer, hull, there, is, a, strong, hull, or, pressure, hull, which, withstands, sea, pressure, and, has, normal, atmospheric, pressure, inside, as, early, as, world, war, i, it, was, realized, that, the, optimal, shape, for, withstanding, pressure, conflicted, with, the, optimal, shape, for, seakeeping, and, minimal, drag, at, the, surface, and, construction, difficulties, further, complicated, the, problem, this, was, solved, either, by, a, compromise, shape, or, by, using, two, layered, hulls, the, internal, strength, hull, for, withstanding, pressure, and, an, external, fairing, for, hydrodynamic, shape, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, most, submarines, had, an, additional, partial, casing, on, the, top, bow, and, stern, built, of, thinner, metal, which, was, flooded, when, submerged, germany, went, further, with, the, type, xxi, a, general, predecessor, of, modern, submarines, in, which, the, pressure, hull, was, fully, enclosed, inside, the, light, hull, but, optimized, for, submerged, navigation, unlike, earlier, designs, that, were, optimized, for, surface, operation, after, world, war, ii, approaches, split, the, soviet, union, changed, its, designs, basing, them, on, german, developments, all, post, world, war, ii, heavy, soviet, and, russian, submarines, are, built, with, a, double, hull, structure, american, and, most, other, western, submarines, switched, to, a, primarily, single, hull, approach, they, still, have, light, hull, sections, in, the, bow, and, stern, which, house, main, ballast, tanks, and, provide, a, hydrodynamically, optimized, shape, but, the, main, cylindrical, hull, section, has, only, a, single, plating, layer, double, hulls, are, being, considered, for, future, submarines, in, the, united, states, to, improve, payload, capacity, stealth, and, range, the, pressure, hull, is, generally, constructed, of, thick, high, strength, steel, with, a, complex, structure, and, high, strength, reserve, and, is, separated, by, watertight, bulkheads, into, several, compartments, there, are, also, examples, of, more, than, two, hulls, in, a, submarine, like, the, typhoon, class, which, has, two, main, pressure, hulls, and, three, smaller, ones, for, control, room, torpedoes, and, steering, gear, with, the, missile, launch, system, between, the, main, hulls, all, surrounded, and, supported, by, the, outer, light, hydrodynamic, hull, when, submerged, the, pressure, hull, provides, most, of, the, buoyancy, for, the, whole, vessel, the, dive, depth, cannot, be, increased, easily, simply, making, the, hull, thicker, increases, the, structural, weight, and, requires, reduction, of, onboard, equipment, weight, and, increasing, the, diameter, requires, a, proportional, increase, in, thickness, for, the, same, material, and, architecture, ultimately, resulting, in, a, pressure, hull, that, does, not, have, sufficient, buoyancy, to, support, its, own, weight, as, in, a, bathyscaphe, this, is, acceptable, for, civilian, research, submersibles, but, not, military, submarines, which, need, to, carry, a, large, equipment, crew, and, weapons, load, to, fulfill, their, function, construction, materials, with, greater, specific, strength, and, specific, modulus, are, needed, wwi, submarines, had, hulls, of, carbon, steel, with, a, 100, metre, 330, ft, maximum, depth, during, wwii, high, strength, alloyed, steel, was, introduced, allowing, 200, metre, 660, ft, depths, high, strength, alloy, steel, remains, the, primary, material, for, submarines, today, with, 250, 400, metre, 820, 1, 310, ft, depths, which, cannot, be, exceeded, on, a, military, submarine, without, design, compromises, to, exceed, that, limit, a, few, submarines, were, built, with, titanium, hulls, titanium, alloys, can, be, stronger, than, steel, lighter, and, most, importantly, have, higher, immersed, specific, strength, and, specific, modulus, titanium, is, also, not, ferromagnetic, important, for, stealth, titanium, submarines, were, built, by, the, soviet, union, which, developed, specialized, high, strength, alloys, it, has, produced, several, types, of, titanium, submarines, titanium, alloys, allow, a, major, increase, in, depth, but, other, systems, must, be, redesigned, to, cope, so, test, depth, was, limited, to, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, for, the, soviet, submarine, k, 278, komsomolets, the, deepest, diving, combat, submarine, an, alfa, class, submarine, may, have, successfully, operated, at, 1, 300, metres, 4, 300, ft, though, continuous, operation, at, such, depths, would, produce, excessive, stress, on, many, submarine, systems, titanium, does, not, flex, as, readily, as, steel, and, may, become, brittle, after, many, dive, cycles, despite, its, benefits, the, high, cost, of, titanium, construction, led, to, the, abandonment, of, titanium, submarine, construction, as, the, cold, war, ended, deep, diving, civilian, submarines, have, used, thick, acrylic, pressure, hulls, although, the, specific, strength, and, specific, modulus, of, acrylic, are, not, very, high, the, density, is, only, 1, 18g, cm, 3, so, it, is, only, very, slightly, denser, than, water, and, the, buoyancy, penalty, of, increased, thickness, is, correspondingly, low, the, deepest, deep, submergence, vehicle, dsv, to, date, is, trieste, on, 5, october, 1959, trieste, departed, san, diego, for, guam, aboard, the, freighter, santa, maria, to, participate, in, project, nekton, a, series, of, very, deep, dives, in, the, mariana, trench, on, 23, january, 1960, trieste, reached, the, ocean, floor, in, the, challenger, deep, the, deepest, southern, part, of, the, mariana, trench, carrying, jacques, piccard, son, of, auguste, and, lieutenant, don, walsh, usn, this, was, the, first, time, a, vessel, crewed, or, uncrewed, had, reached, the, deepest, point, in, the, earth, s, oceans, the, onboard, systems, indicated, a, depth, of, 11, 521, metres, 37, 799, ft, although, this, was, later, revised, to, 10, 916, metres, 35, 814, ft, and, more, accurate, measurements, made, in, 1995, have, found, the, challenger, deep, slightly, shallower, at, 10, 911, metres, 35, 797, ft, building, a, pressure, hull, is, difficult, as, it, must, withstand, pressures, at, its, required, diving, depth, when, the, hull, is, perfectly, round, in, cross, section, the, pressure, is, evenly, distributed, and, causes, only, hull, compression, if, the, shape, is, not, perfect, the, hull, deflects, more, in, some, places, and, buckling, instability, is, the, usual, failure, mode, inevitable, minor, deviations, are, resisted, by, stiffener, rings, but, even, a, one, inch, 25, mm, deviation, from, roundness, results, in, over, 30, percent, decrease, of, maximal, hydrostatic, load, and, consequently, dive, depth, the, hull, must, therefore, be, constructed, with, high, precision, all, hull, parts, must, be, welded, without, defects, and, all, joints, are, checked, multiple, times, with, different, methods, contributing, to, the, high, cost, of, modern, submarines, for, example, each, virginia, class, attack, submarine, costs, us, 2, 6, billion, over, us, 200, 000, per, ton, of, displacement, the, first, submarines, were, propelled, by, humans, the, first, mechanically, driven, submarine, was, the, 1863, french, plongeur, which, used, compressed, air, for, propulsion, anaerobic, propulsion, was, first, employed, by, the, spanish, ictineo, ii, in, 1864, which, used, a, solution, of, zinc, manganese, dioxide, and, potassium, chlorate, to, generate, sufficient, heat, to, power, a, steam, engine, while, also, providing, oxygen, for, the, crew, a, similar, system, was, not, employed, again, until, 1940, when, the, german, navy, tested, a, hydrogen, peroxide, based, system, the, walter, turbine, on, the, experimental, v, 80, submarine, and, later, on, the, naval, u, 791, and, type, xvii, submarines, the, system, was, further, developed, for, the, british, explorer, class, completed, in, 1958, until, the, advent, of, nuclear, marine, propulsion, most, 20th, century, submarines, used, electric, motors, and, batteries, for, running, underwater, and, combustion, engines, on, the, surface, and, for, battery, recharging, early, submarines, used, gasoline, petrol, engines, but, this, quickly, gave, way, to, kerosene, paraffin, and, then, diesel, engines, because, of, reduced, flammability, and, with, diesel, improved, fuel, efficiency, and, thus, also, greater, range, a, combination, of, diesel, and, electric, propulsion, became, the, norm, initially, the, combustion, engine, and, the, electric, motor, were, in, most, cases, connected, to, the, same, shaft, so, that, both, could, directly, drive, the, propeller, the, combustion, engine, was, placed, at, the, front, end, of, the, stern, section, with, the, electric, motor, behind, it, followed, by, the, propeller, shaft, the, engine, was, connected, to, the, motor, by, a, clutch, and, the, motor, in, turn, connected, to, the, propeller, shaft, by, another, clutch, with, only, the, rear, clutch, engaged, the, electric, motor, could, drive, the, propeller, as, required, for, fully, submerged, operation, with, both, clutches, engaged, the, combustion, engine, could, drive, the, propeller, as, was, possible, when, operating, on, the, surface, or, at, a, later, stage, when, snorkeling, the, electric, motor, would, in, this, case, serve, as, a, generator, to, charge, the, batteries, or, if, no, charging, was, needed, be, allowed, to, rotate, freely, with, only, the, front, clutch, engaged, the, combustion, engine, could, drive, the, electric, motor, as, a, generator, for, charging, the, batteries, without, simultaneously, forcing, the, propeller, to, move, the, motor, could, have, multiple, armatures, on, the, shaft, which, could, be, electrically, coupled, in, series, for, slow, speed, and, in, parallel, for, high, speed, these, connections, were, called, group, down, and, group, up, respectively, while, most, early, submarines, used, a, direct, mechanical, connection, between, the, combustion, engine, and, the, propeller, an, alternative, solution, was, considered, as, well, as, implemented, at, a, very, early, stage, that, solution, consists, in, first, converting, the, work, of, the, combustion, engine, into, electric, energy, via, a, dedicated, generator, this, energy, is, then, used, to, drive, the, propeller, via, the, electric, motor, and, to, the, extent, required, for, charging, the, batteries, in, this, configuration, the, electric, motor, is, thus, responsible, for, driving, the, propeller, at, all, times, regardless, of, whether, air, is, available, so, that, the, combustion, engine, can, also, be, used, or, not, among, the, pioneers, of, this, alternative, solution, was, the, very, first, submarine, of, the, swedish, navy, hswms, hajen, later, renamed, ub, no, 1, launched, in, 1904, while, its, design, was, generally, inspired, by, the, first, submarine, commissioned, by, the, us, navy, uss, holland, it, deviated, from, the, latter, in, at, least, three, significant, ways, by, adding, a, periscope, by, replacing, the, gasoline, engine, by, a, semidiesel, engine, a, hot, bulb, engine, primarily, meant, to, be, fueled, by, kerosene, later, replaced, by, a, true, diesel, engine, and, by, severing, the, mechanical, link, between, the, combustion, engine, and, the, propeller, by, instead, letting, the, former, drive, a, dedicated, generator, by, so, doing, it, took, three, significant, steps, toward, what, was, eventually, to, become, the, dominant, technology, for, conventional, i, e, non, nuclear, submarines, in, the, following, years, the, swedish, navy, added, another, seven, submarines, in, three, different, classes, 2nd, class, laxen, class, and, braxen, class, using, the, same, propulsion, technology, but, fitted, with, true, diesel, engines, rather, than, semidiesels, from, the, outset, since, by, that, time, the, technology, was, usually, based, on, the, diesel, engine, rather, than, some, other, type, of, combustion, engine, it, eventually, came, to, be, known, as, diesel, electric, transmission, like, many, other, early, submarines, those, initially, designed, in, sweden, were, quite, small, less, than, 200, tonnes, and, thus, confined, to, littoral, operation, when, the, swedish, navy, wanted, to, add, larger, vessels, capable, of, operating, further, from, the, shore, their, designs, were, purchased, from, companies, abroad, that, already, had, the, required, experience, first, italian, fiat, laurenti, and, later, german, a, g, weser, and, ivs, as, a, side, effect, the, diesel, electric, transmission, was, temporarily, abandoned, however, diesel, electric, transmission, was, immediately, reintroduced, when, sweden, began, designing, its, own, submarines, again, in, the, mid, 1930s, from, that, point, onwards, it, has, been, consistently, used, for, all, new, classes, of, swedish, submarines, albeit, supplemented, by, air, independent, propulsion, aip, as, provided, by, stirling, engines, beginning, with, hms, n, cken, in, 1988, another, early, adopter, of, diesel, electric, transmission, was, the, us, navy, whose, bureau, of, engineering, proposed, its, use, in, 1928, it, was, subsequently, tried, in, the, s, class, submarines, s, 3, s, 6, and, s, 7, before, being, put, into, production, with, the, porpoise, class, of, the, 1930s, from, that, point, onwards, it, continued, to, be, used, on, most, us, conventional, submarines, apart, from, the, british, u, class, and, some, submarines, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, that, used, separate, diesel, generators, for, low, speed, running, few, navies, other, than, those, of, sweden, and, the, us, made, much, use, of, diesel, electric, transmission, before, 1945, after, world, war, ii, by, contrast, it, gradually, became, the, dominant, mode, of, propulsion, for, conventional, submarines, however, its, adoption, was, not, always, swift, notably, the, soviet, navy, did, not, introduce, diesel, electric, transmission, on, its, conventional, submarines, until, 1980, with, its, paltus, class, if, diesel, electric, transmission, had, only, brought, advantages, and, no, disadvantages, in, comparison, with, a, system, that, mechanically, connects, the, diesel, engine, to, the, propeller, it, would, undoubtedly, have, become, dominant, much, earlier, the, disadvantages, include, the, following, the, reason, why, diesel, electric, transmission, has, become, the, dominant, alternative, in, spite, of, these, disadvantages, is, of, course, that, it, also, comes, with, many, advantages, and, that, on, balance, these, have, eventually, been, found, to, be, more, important, the, advantages, include, the, following, during, world, war, ii, the, germans, experimented, with, the, idea, of, the, schnorchel, snorkel, from, captured, dutch, submarines, but, did, not, see, the, need, for, them, until, rather, late, in, the, war, the, schnorchel, is, a, retractable, pipe, that, supplies, air, to, the, diesel, engines, while, submerged, at, periscope, depth, allowing, the, boat, to, cruise, and, recharge, its, batteries, while, maintaining, a, degree, of, stealth, especially, as, first, implemented, however, it, turned, out, to, be, far, from, a, perfect, solution, there, were, problems, with, the, device, s, valve, sticking, shut, or, closing, as, it, dunked, in, rough, weather, since, the, system, used, the, entire, pressure, hull, as, a, buffer, the, diesels, would, instantaneously, suck, huge, volumes, of, air, from, the, boat, s, compartments, and, the, crew, often, suffered, painful, ear, injuries, speed, was, limited, to, 8, knots, 15, km, h, lest, the, device, snap, from, stress, the, schnorchel, also, created, noise, that, made, the, boat, easier, to, detect, with, sonar, yet, more, difficult, for, the, on, board, sonar, to, detect, signals, from, other, vessels, finally, allied, radar, eventually, became, sufficiently, advanced, that, the, schnorchel, mast, could, be, detected, beyond, visual, range, while, the, snorkel, renders, a, submarine, far, less, detectable, it, is, thus, not, perfect, in, clear, weather, diesel, exhausts, can, be, seen, on, the, surface, to, a, distance, of, about, three, miles, while, periscope, feather, the, wave, created, by, the, snorkel, or, periscope, moving, through, the, water, is, visible, from, far, off, in, calm, sea, conditions, modern, radar, is, also, capable, of, detecting, a, snorkel, in, calm, sea, conditions, the, problem, of, the, diesels, causing, a, vacuum, in, the, submarine, when, the, head, valve, is, submerged, still, exists, in, later, model, diesel, submarines, but, is, mitigated, by, high, vacuum, cut, off, sensors, that, shut, down, the, engines, when, the, vacuum, in, the, ship, reaches, a, pre, set, point, modern, snorkel, induction, masts, have, a, fail, safe, design, using, compressed, air, controlled, by, a, simple, electrical, circuit, to, hold, the, head, valve, open, against, the, pull, of, a, powerful, spring, seawater, washing, over, the, mast, shorts, out, exposed, electrodes, on, top, breaking, the, control, and, shutting, the, head, valve, while, it, is, submerged, us, submarines, did, not, adopt, the, use, of, snorkels, until, after, wwii, during, world, war, ii, german, type, xxi, submarines, also, known, as, elektroboote, were, the, first, submarines, designed, to, operate, submerged, for, extended, periods, initially, they, were, to, carry, hydrogen, peroxide, for, long, term, fast, air, independent, propulsion, but, were, ultimately, built, with, very, large, batteries, instead, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, british, and, soviets, experimented, with, hydrogen, peroxide, kerosene, paraffin, engines, that, could, run, surfaced, and, submerged, the, results, were, not, encouraging, though, the, soviet, union, deployed, a, class, of, submarines, with, this, engine, type, codenamed, quebec, by, nato, they, were, considered, unsuccessful, the, united, states, also, used, hydrogen, peroxide, in, an, experimental, midget, submarine, x, 1, it, was, originally, powered, by, a, hydrogen, peroxide, diesel, engine, and, battery, system, until, an, explosion, of, her, hydrogen, peroxide, supply, on, 20, may, 1957, x, 1, was, later, converted, to, use, diesel, electric, drive, today, several, navies, use, air, independent, propulsion, notably, sweden, uses, stirling, technology, on, the, gotland, class, and, s, dermanland, class, submarines, the, stirling, engine, is, heated, by, burning, diesel, fuel, with, liquid, oxygen, from, cryogenic, tanks, a, newer, development, in, air, independent, propulsion, is, hydrogen, fuel, cells, first, used, on, the, german, type, 212, submarine, with, nine, 34, kw, or, two, 120, kw, cells, fuel, cells, are, also, used, in, the, new, spanish, s, 80, class, submarines, although, with, the, fuel, stored, as, ethanol, and, then, converted, into, hydrogen, before, use, one, new, technology, that, is, being, introduced, starting, with, the, japanese, navy, s, eleventh, s, ry, class, submarine, js, ry, is, a, more, modern, battery, the, lithium, ion, battery, these, batteries, have, about, double, the, electric, storage, of, traditional, batteries, and, by, changing, out, the, lead, acid, batteries, in, their, normal, storage, areas, plus, filling, up, the, large, hull, space, normally, devoted, to, aip, engine, and, fuel, tanks, with, many, tons, of, lithium, ion, batteries, modern, submarines, can, actually, return, to, a, pure, diesel, electric, configuration, yet, have, the, added, underwater, range, and, power, normally, associated, with, aip, equipped, submarines, steam, power, was, resurrected, in, the, 1950s, with, a, nuclear, powered, steam, turbine, driving, a, generator, by, eliminating, the, need, for, atmospheric, oxygen, the, time, that, a, submarine, could, remain, submerged, was, limited, only, by, its, food, stores, as, breathing, air, was, recycled, and, fresh, water, distilled, from, seawater, more, importantly, a, nuclear, submarine, has, unlimited, range, at, top, speed, this, allows, it, to, travel, from, its, operating, base, to, the, combat, zone, in, a, much, shorter, time, and, makes, it, a, far, more, difficult, target, for, most, anti, submarine, weapons, nuclear, powered, submarines, have, a, relatively, small, battery, and, diesel, engine, generator, powerplant, for, emergency, use, if, the, reactors, must, be, shut, down, nuclear, power, is, now, used, in, all, large, submarines, but, due, to, the, high, cost, and, large, size, of, nuclear, reactors, smaller, submarines, still, use, diesel, electric, propulsion, the, ratio, of, larger, to, smaller, submarines, depends, on, strategic, needs, the, us, navy, french, navy, and, the, british, royal, navy, operate, only, nuclear, submarines, which, is, explained, by, the, need, for, distant, operations, other, major, operators, rely, on, a, mix, of, nuclear, submarines, for, strategic, purposes, and, diesel, electric, submarines, for, defense, most, fleets, have, no, nuclear, submarines, due, to, the, limited, availability, of, nuclear, power, and, submarine, technology, diesel, electric, submarines, have, a, stealth, advantage, over, their, nuclear, counterparts, nuclear, submarines, generate, noise, from, coolant, pumps, and, turbo, machinery, needed, to, operate, the, reactor, even, at, low, power, levels, some, nuclear, submarines, such, as, the, american, ohio, class, can, operate, with, their, reactor, coolant, pumps, secured, making, them, quieter, than, electric, subs, a, conventional, submarine, operating, on, batteries, is, almost, completely, silent, the, only, noise, coming, from, the, shaft, bearings, propeller, and, flow, noise, around, the, hull, all, of, which, stops, when, the, sub, hovers, in, mid, water, to, listen, leaving, only, the, noise, from, crew, activity, commercial, submarines, usually, rely, only, on, batteries, since, they, operate, in, conjunction, with, a, mother, ship, several, serious, nuclear, and, radiation, accidents, have, involved, nuclear, submarine, mishaps, the, soviet, submarine, k, 19, reactor, accident, in, 1961, resulted, in, 8, deaths, and, more, than, 30, other, people, were, over, exposed, to, radiation, the, soviet, submarine, k, 27, reactor, accident, in, 1968, resulted, in, 9, fatalities, and, 83, other, injuries, the, soviet, submarine, k, 431, accident, in, 1985, resulted, in, 10, fatalities, and, 49, other, radiation, injuries, oil, fired, steam, turbines, powered, the, british, k, class, submarines, built, during, world, war, i, and, later, to, give, them, the, surface, speed, to, keep, up, with, the, battle, fleet, the, k, class, subs, were, not, very, successful, however, toward, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, some, submarines, such, as, the, british, vanguard, class, began, to, be, fitted, with, pump, jet, propulsors, instead, of, propellers, though, these, are, heavier, more, expensive, and, less, efficient, than, a, propeller, they, are, significantly, quieter, providing, an, important, tactical, advantage, the, success, of, the, submarine, is, inextricably, linked, to, the, development, of, the, torpedo, invented, by, robert, whitehead, in, 1866, his, invention, essentially, the, same, now, as, it, was, 140, years, ago, allowed, the, submarine, make, the, leap, from, novelty, to, a, weapon, of, war, prior, to, the, development, and, miniaturization, of, sonar, sensitive, enough, to, track, a, submerged, submarine, attacks, were, exclusively, restricted, to, ships, and, submarines, operating, near, or, at, the, surface, targeting, of, unguided, torpedoes, was, initially, done, by, eye, but, by, world, war, ii, analog, targeting, computers, began, to, proliferate, being, able, to, calculate, basic, firing, solutions, nonetheless, multiple, straight, running, torpedoes, could, be, required, to, ensure, a, target, was, hit, with, at, most, 20, to, 25, torpedoes, stored, on, board, the, number, of, attacks, a, submarine, could, make, was, limited, to, increase, combat, endurance, starting, in, world, war, i, submarines, also, functioned, as, submersible, gunboats, using, their, deck, guns, against, unarmed, targets, and, diving, to, escape, and, engage, enemy, warships, the, initial, importance, of, these, deck, guns, encouraged, the, development, of, the, unsuccessful, submarine, cruiser, such, as, the, french, surcouf, and, the, royal, navy, s, x1, and, m, class, submarines, with, the, arrival, of, anti, submarine, warfare, asw, aircraft, guns, became, more, for, defense, than, attack, a, more, practical, method, of, increasing, combat, endurance, was, the, external, torpedo, tube, loaded, only, in, port, the, ability, of, submarines, to, approach, enemy, harbours, covertly, led, to, their, use, as, minelayers, minelaying, submarines, of, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, were, specially, built, for, that, purpose, modern, submarine, laid, mines, such, as, the, british, mark, 5, stonefish, and, mark, 6, sea, urchin, can, be, deployed, from, a, submarine, s, torpedo, tubes, after, world, war, ii, both, the, us, and, the, ussr, experimented, with, submarine, launched, cruise, missiles, such, as, the, ssm, n, 8, regulus, and, p, 5, pyatyorka, such, missiles, required, the, submarine, to, surface, to, fire, its, missiles, they, were, the, forerunners, of, modern, submarine, launched, cruise, missiles, which, can, be, fired, from, the, torpedo, tubes, of, submerged, submarines, for, example, the, us, bgm, 109, tomahawk, and, russian, rpk, 2, viyuga, and, versions, of, surface, to, surface, anti, ship, missiles, such, as, the, exocet, and, harpoon, encapsulated, for, submarine, launch, ballistic, missiles, can, also, be, fired, from, a, submarine, s, torpedo, tubes, for, example, missiles, such, as, the, anti, submarine, subroc, with, internal, volume, as, limited, as, ever, and, the, desire, to, carry, heavier, warloads, the, idea, of, the, external, launch, tube, was, revived, usually, for, encapsulated, missiles, with, such, tubes, being, placed, between, the, internal, pressure, and, outer, streamlined, hulls, guided, torpedoes, also, proliferated, extensively, during, and, after, world, war, ii, even, further, increasing, the, combat, endurance, and, lethality, of, submarines, and, allowing, them, to, engage, other, submarines, at, depth, with, the, latter, now, being, one, of, the, primary, missions, of, the, modern, attack, submarine, the, strategic, mission, of, the, ssm, n, 8, and, the, p, 5, was, taken, up, by, submarine, launched, ballistic, missile, beginning, with, the, us, navy, s, polaris, missile, and, subsequently, the, poseidon, and, trident, missiles, germany, is, working, on, the, torpedo, tube, launched, short, range, idas, missile, which, can, be, used, against, asw, helicopters, as, well, as, surface, ships, and, coastal, targets, a, submarine, can, have, a, variety, of, sensors, depending, on, its, missions, modern, military, submarines, rely, almost, entirely, on, a, suite, of, passive, and, active, sonars, to, locate, targets, active, sonar, relies, on, an, audible, ping, to, generate, echoes, to, reveal, objects, around, the, submarine, active, systems, are, rarely, used, as, doing, so, reveals, the, sub, s, presence, passive, sonar, is, a, set, of, sensitive, hydrophones, set, into, the, hull, or, trailed, in, a, towed, array, normally, trailing, several, hundred, feet, behind, the, sub, the, towed, array, is, the, mainstay, of, nato, submarine, detection, systems, as, it, reduces, the, flow, noise, heard, by, operators, hull, mounted, sonar, is, employed, in, addition, to, the, towed, array, as, the, towed, array, can, not, work, in, shallow, depth, and, during, maneuvering, in, addition, sonar, has, a, blind, spot, through, the, submarine, so, a, system, on, both, the, front, and, back, works, to, eliminate, that, problem, as, the, towed, array, trails, behind, and, below, the, submarine, it, also, allows, the, submarine, to, have, a, system, both, above, and, below, the, thermocline, at, the, proper, depth, sound, passing, through, the, thermocline, is, distorted, resulting, in, a, lower, detection, range, submarines, also, carry, radar, equipment, to, detect, surface, ships, and, aircraft, submarine, captains, are, more, likely, to, use, radar, detection, gear, than, active, radar, to, detect, targets, as, radar, can, be, detected, far, beyond, its, own, return, range, revealing, the, submarine, periscopes, are, rarely, used, except, for, position, fixes, and, to, verify, a, contact, s, identity, civilian, submarines, such, as, the, dsv, alvin, or, the, russian, mir, submersibles, rely, on, small, active, sonar, sets, and, viewing, ports, to, navigate, the, human, eye, cannot, detect, sunlight, below, about, 300, feet, 91, m, underwater, so, high, intensity, lights, are, used, to, illuminate, the, viewing, area, early, submarines, had, few, navigation, aids, but, modern, subs, have, a, variety, of, navigation, systems, modern, military, submarines, use, an, inertial, guidance, system, for, navigation, while, submerged, but, drift, error, unavoidably, builds, over, time, to, counter, this, the, crew, occasionally, uses, the, global, positioning, system, to, obtain, an, accurate, position, the, periscope, a, retractable, tube, with, a, prism, system, that, provides, a, view, of, the, surface, is, only, used, occasionally, in, modern, submarines, since, the, visibility, range, is, short, the, virginia, class, and, astute, class, submarines, use, photonics, masts, rather, than, hull, penetrating, optical, periscopes, these, masts, must, still, be, deployed, above, the, surface, and, use, electronic, sensors, for, visible, light, infrared, laser, range, finding, and, electromagnetic, surveillance, one, benefit, to, hoisting, the, mast, above, the, surface, is, that, while, the, mast, is, above, the, water, the, entire, sub, is, still, below, the, water, and, is, much, harder, to, detect, visually, or, by, radar, military, submarines, use, several, systems, to, communicate, with, distant, command, centers, or, other, ships, one, is, vlf, very, low, frequency, radio, which, can, reach, a, submarine, either, on, the, surface, or, submerged, to, a, fairly, shallow, depth, usually, less, than, 250, feet, 76, m, elf, extremely, low, frequency, can, reach, a, submarine, at, greater, depths, but, has, a, very, low, bandwidth, and, is, generally, used, to, call, a, submerged, sub, to, a, shallower, depth, where, vlf, signals, can, reach, a, submarine, also, has, the, option, of, floating, a, long, buoyant, wire, antenna, to, a, shallower, depth, allowing, vlf, transmissions, by, a, deeply, submerged, boat, by, extending, a, radio, mast, a, submarine, can, also, use, a, burst, transmission, technique, a, burst, transmission, takes, only, a, fraction, of, a, second, minimizing, a, submarine, s, risk, of, detection, to, communicate, with, other, submarines, a, system, known, as, gertrude, is, used, gertrude, is, basically, a, sonar, telephone, voice, communication, from, one, submarine, is, transmitted, by, low, power, speakers, into, the, water, where, it, is, detected, by, passive, sonars, on, the, receiving, submarine, the, range, of, this, system, is, probably, very, short, and, using, it, radiates, sound, into, the, water, which, can, be, heard, by, the, enemy, civilian, submarines, can, use, similar, albeit, less, powerful, systems, to, communicate, with, support, ships, or, other, submersibles, in, the, area, with, nuclear, power, or, air, independent, propulsion, submarines, can, remain, submerged, for, months, at, a, time, conventional, diesel, submarines, must, periodically, resurface, or, run, on, snorkel, to, recharge, their, batteries, most, modern, military, submarines, generate, breathing, oxygen, by, electrolysis, of, fresh, water, using, a, device, called, an, electrolytic, oxygen, generator, emergency, oxygen, can, be, produced, by, burning, sodium, chlorate, candles, atmosphere, control, equipment, includes, a, carbon, dioxide, scrubber, which, uses, a, spray, of, monoethanolamine, mea, absorbent, to, remove, the, gas, from, the, air, after, which, the, mea, is, heated, in, a, boiler, to, release, the, co, 2, which, is, then, pumped, overboard, emergency, scrubbing, can, also, be, done, with, lithium, hydroxide, which, is, consumable, a, machine, that, uses, a, catalyst, to, convert, carbon, monoxide, into, carbon, dioxide, removed, by, the, co, 2, scrubber, and, bonds, hydrogen, produced, from, the, ship, s, storage, battery, with, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, to, produce, water, is, also, used, an, atmosphere, monitoring, system, samples, the, air, from, different, areas, of, the, ship, for, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, r, 12, and, r, 114, refrigerants, carbon, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, and, other, gases, poisonous, gases, are, removed, and, oxygen, is, replenished, by, use, of, an, oxygen, bank, located, in, a, main, ballast, tank, some, heavier, submarines, have, two, oxygen, bleed, stations, forward, and, aft, the, oxygen, in, the, air, is, sometimes, kept, a, few, percent, less, than, atmospheric, concentration, to, reduce, fire, risk, fresh, water, is, produced, by, either, an, evaporator, or, a, reverse, osmosis, unit, the, primary, use, for, fresh, water, is, to, provide, feedwater, for, the, reactor, and, steam, propulsion, plants, it, is, also, available, for, showers, sinks, cooking, and, cleaning, once, propulsion, plant, needs, have, been, met, seawater, is, used, to, flush, toilets, and, the, resulting, blackwater, is, stored, in, a, sanitary, tank, until, it, is, blown, overboard, using, pressurized, air, or, pumped, overboard, by, using, a, special, sanitary, pump, the, blackwater, discharge, system, requires, skill, to, operate, and, isolation, valves, must, be, closed, before, discharge, the, german, type, viic, boat, u, 1206, was, lost, with, casualties, because, of, human, error, while, using, this, system, water, from, showers, and, sinks, is, stored, separately, in, grey, water, tanks, and, discharged, overboard, using, drain, pumps, trash, on, modern, large, submarines, is, usually, disposed, of, using, a, tube, called, a, trash, disposal, unit, tdu, where, it, is, compacted, into, a, galvanized, steel, can, at, the, bottom, of, the, tdu, is, a, large, ball, valve, an, ice, plug, is, set, on, top, of, the, ball, valve, to, protect, it, the, cans, atop, the, ice, plug, the, top, breech, door, is, shut, and, the, tdu, is, flooded, and, equalized, with, sea, pressure, the, ball, valve, is, opened, and, the, cans, fall, out, assisted, by, scrap, iron, weights, in, the, cans, the, tdu, is, also, flushed, with, seawater, to, ensure, it, is, completely, empty, and, the, ball, valve, is, clear, before, closing, the, valve, a, typical, nuclear, submarine, has, a, crew, of, over, 80, conventional, boats, typically, have, fewer, than, 40, the, conditions, on, a, submarine, can, be, difficult, because, crew, members, must, work, in, isolation, for, long, periods, of, time, without, family, contact, and, in, cramped, conditions, submarines, normally, maintain, radio, silence, to, avoid, detection, operating, a, submarine, is, dangerous, even, in, peacetime, and, many, submarines, have, been, lost, in, accidents, most, navies, prohibited, women, from, serving, on, submarines, even, after, they, had, been, permitted, to, serve, on, surface, warships, the, royal, norwegian, navy, became, the, first, navy, to, allow, women, on, its, submarine, crews, in, 1985, the, royal, danish, navy, allowed, female, submariners, in, 1988, others, followed, suit, including, the, swedish, navy, 1989, the, royal, australian, navy, 1998, the, spanish, navy, 1999, the, german, navy, 2001, and, the, canadian, navy, 2002, in, 1995, solveig, krey, of, the, royal, norwegian, navy, became, the, first, female, officer, to, assume, command, on, a, military, submarine, hnoms, kobben, on, 8, december, 2011, british, defence, secretary, philip, hammond, announced, that, the, uk, s, ban, on, women, in, submarines, was, to, be, lifted, from, 2013, previously, there, were, fears, that, women, were, more, at, risk, from, a, build, up, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, submarine, but, a, study, showed, no, medical, reason, to, exclude, women, though, pregnant, women, would, still, be, excluded, similar, dangers, to, the, pregnant, woman, and, her, fetus, barred, women, from, submarine, service, in, sweden, in, 1983, when, all, other, positions, were, made, available, for, them, in, the, swedish, navy, today, pregnant, women, are, still, not, allowed, to, serve, on, submarines, in, sweden, however, the, policymakers, thought, that, it, was, discriminatory, with, a, general, ban, and, demanded, that, women, should, be, tried, on, their, individual, merits, and, have, their, suitability, evaluated, and, compared, to, other, candidates, further, they, noted, that, a, woman, complying, with, such, high, demands, is, unlikely, to, become, pregnant, in, may, 2014, three, women, became, the, rn, s, first, female, submariners, women, have, served, on, us, navy, surface, ships, since, 1993, and, as, of, 2011, 2012, began, serving, on, submarines, for, the, first, time, until, presently, the, navy, allowed, only, three, exceptions, to, women, being, on, board, military, submarines, female, civilian, technicians, for, a, few, days, at, most, women, midshipmen, on, an, overnight, during, summer, training, for, navy, rotc, and, naval, academy, and, family, members, for, one, day, dependent, cruises, in, 2009, senior, officials, including, then, secretary, of, the, navy, ray, mabus, joint, chief, of, staff, admiral, michael, mullen, and, chief, of, naval, operations, admiral, gary, roughead, began, the, process, of, finding, a, way, to, implement, women, on, submarines, the, us, navy, rescinded, its, no, women, on, subs, policy, in, 2010, both, the, us, and, british, navies, operate, nuclear, powered, submarines, that, deploy, for, periods, of, six, months, or, longer, other, navies, that, permit, women, to, serve, on, submarines, operate, conventionally, powered, submarines, which, deploy, for, much, shorter, periods, usually, only, for, a, few, months, prior, to, the, change, by, the, us, no, nation, using, nuclear, submarines, permitted, women, to, serve, on, board, in, 2011, the, first, class, of, female, submarine, officers, graduated, from, naval, submarine, school, s, submarine, officer, basic, course, sobc, at, the, naval, submarine, base, new, london, additionally, more, senior, ranking, and, experienced, female, supply, officers, from, the, surface, warfare, specialty, attended, sobc, as, well, proceeding, to, fleet, ballistic, missile, ssbn, and, guided, missile, ssgn, submarines, along, with, the, new, female, submarine, line, officers, beginning, in, late, 2011, by, late, 2011, several, women, were, assigned, to, the, ohio, class, ballistic, missile, submarine,
