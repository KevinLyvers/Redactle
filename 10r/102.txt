http, hypertext, transfer, protocol, is, an, application, layer, protocol, in, the, internet, protocol, suite, model, for, distributed, collaborative, hypermedia, information, systems, http, is, the, foundation, of, data, communication, for, the, world, wide, web, where, hypertext, documents, include, hyperlinks, to, other, resources, that, the, user, can, easily, access, for, example, by, a, mouse, click, or, by, tapping, the, screen, in, a, web, browser, development, of, http, was, initiated, by, tim, berners, lee, at, cern, in, 1989, and, summarized, in, a, simple, document, describing, the, behavior, of, a, client, and, a, server, using, the, first, http, version, named, 0, 9, that, version, was, subsequently, developed, eventually, becoming, the, public, 1, 0, development, of, early, http, requests, for, comments, rfcs, started, a, few, years, later, in, a, coordinated, effort, by, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, and, the, world, wide, web, consortium, w3c, with, work, later, moving, to, the, ietf, http, 1, was, finalized, and, fully, documented, as, version, 1, 0, in, 1996, it, evolved, as, version, 1, 1, in, 1997, and, then, its, specifications, were, updated, in, 1999, 2014, and, 2022, its, secure, variant, named, https, is, used, by, more, than, 85, of, websites, http, 2, published, in, 2015, provides, a, more, efficient, expression, of, http, s, semantics, on, the, wire, as, of, august, 2024, it, is, supported, by, 66, 2, of, websites, 35, 3, http, 2, 30, 9, http, 3, with, backwards, compatibility, and, supported, by, almost, all, web, browsers, over, 98, of, users, it, is, also, supported, by, major, web, servers, over, transport, layer, security, tls, using, an, application, layer, protocol, negotiation, alpn, extension, where, tls, 1, 2, or, newer, is, required, http, 3, the, successor, to, http, 2, was, published, in, 2022, as, of, february, 2024, it, is, now, used, on, 30, 9, of, websites, and, is, supported, by, most, web, browsers, i, e, at, least, partially, supported, by, 97, of, users, http, 3, uses, quic, instead, of, tcp, for, the, underlying, transport, protocol, like, http, 2, it, does, not, obsolete, previous, major, versions, of, the, protocol, support, for, http, 3, was, added, to, cloudflare, and, google, chrome, first, and, is, also, enabled, in, firefox, http, 3, has, lower, latency, for, real, world, web, pages, if, enabled, on, the, server, and, loads, faster, than, with, http, 2, in, some, cases, over, three, times, faster, than, http, 1, 1, which, is, still, commonly, only, enabled, http, functions, as, a, request, response, protocol, in, the, client, server, model, a, web, browser, for, example, may, be, the, client, whereas, a, process, named, web, server, running, on, a, computer, hosting, one, or, more, websites, may, be, the, server, the, client, submits, an, http, request, message, to, the, server, the, server, which, provides, resources, such, as, html, files, and, other, content, or, performs, other, functions, on, behalf, of, the, client, returns, a, response, message, to, the, client, the, response, contains, completion, status, information, about, the, request, and, may, also, contain, requested, content, in, its, message, body, a, web, browser, is, an, example, of, a, user, agent, ua, other, types, of, user, agent, include, the, indexing, software, used, by, search, providers, web, crawlers, voice, browsers, mobile, apps, and, other, software, that, accesses, consumes, or, displays, web, content, http, is, designed, to, permit, intermediate, network, elements, to, improve, or, enable, communications, between, clients, and, servers, high, traffic, websites, often, benefit, from, web, cache, servers, that, deliver, content, on, behalf, of, upstream, servers, to, improve, response, time, web, browsers, cache, previously, accessed, web, resources, and, reuse, them, whenever, possible, to, reduce, network, traffic, http, proxy, servers, at, private, network, boundaries, can, facilitate, communication, for, clients, without, a, globally, routable, address, by, relaying, messages, with, external, servers, to, allow, intermediate, http, nodes, proxy, servers, web, caches, etc, to, accomplish, their, functions, some, of, the, http, headers, found, in, http, requests, responses, are, managed, hop, by, hop, whereas, other, http, headers, are, managed, end, to, end, managed, only, by, the, source, client, and, by, the, target, web, server, http, is, an, application, layer, protocol, designed, within, the, framework, of, the, internet, protocol, suite, its, definition, presumes, an, underlying, and, reliable, transport, layer, protocol, in, the, latest, version, http, 3, the, transmission, control, protocol, tcp, is, no, longer, used, but, the, older, versions, are, still, more, used, and, they, most, commonly, use, tcp, they, have, also, been, adapted, to, use, unreliable, protocols, such, as, the, user, datagram, protocol, udp, which, http, 3, also, indirectly, always, builds, on, for, example, in, httpu, and, simple, service, discovery, protocol, ssdp, http, resources, are, identified, and, located, on, the, network, by, uniform, resource, locators, urls, using, the, uniform, resource, identifiers, uri, s, schemes, http, and, https, as, defined, in, rfc, 3986, uris, are, encoded, as, hyperlinks, in, html, documents, so, as, to, form, interlinked, hypertext, documents, in, http, 1, 0, a, separate, tcp, connection, to, the, same, server, is, made, for, every, resource, request, in, http, 1, 1, instead, a, tcp, connection, can, be, reused, to, make, multiple, resource, requests, i, e, of, html, pages, frames, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc, http, 1, 1, communications, therefore, experience, less, latency, as, the, establishment, of, tcp, connections, presents, considerable, overhead, especially, under, high, traffic, conditions, http, 2, is, a, revision, of, previous, http, 1, 1, in, order, to, maintain, the, same, client, server, model, and, the, same, protocol, methods, but, with, these, differences, in, order, http, 2, communications, therefore, experience, much, less, latency, and, in, most, cases, even, higher, speeds, than, http, 1, 1, communications, http, 3, is, a, revision, of, previous, http, 2, in, order, to, use, quic, udp, transport, protocols, instead, of, tcp, before, that, version, tcp, ip, connections, were, used, but, now, only, the, ip, layer, is, used, which, udp, like, tcp, builds, on, this, slightly, improves, the, average, speed, of, communications, and, to, avoid, the, occasional, very, rare, problem, of, tcp, connection, congestion, that, can, temporarily, block, or, slow, down, the, data, flow, of, all, its, streams, another, form, of, head, of, line, blocking, the, term, hypertext, was, coined, by, ted, nelson, in, 1965, in, the, xanadu, project, which, was, in, turn, inspired, by, vannevar, bush, s, 1930s, vision, of, the, microfilm, based, information, retrieval, and, management, memex, system, described, in, his, 1945, essay, as, we, may, think, tim, berners, lee, and, his, team, at, cern, are, credited, with, inventing, the, original, http, along, with, html, and, the, associated, technology, for, a, web, server, and, a, client, user, interface, called, web, browser, berners, lee, designed, http, in, order, to, help, with, the, adoption, of, his, other, idea, the, worldwideweb, project, which, was, first, proposed, in, 1989, now, known, as, the, world, wide, web, the, first, web, server, went, live, in, 1990, the, protocol, used, had, only, one, method, namely, get, which, would, request, a, page, from, a, server, the, response, from, the, server, was, always, an, html, page, in, 1991, the, first, documented, official, version, of, http, was, written, as, a, plain, document, less, than, 700, words, long, and, this, version, was, named, http, 0, 9, which, supported, only, get, method, allowing, clients, to, only, retrieve, html, documents, from, the, server, but, not, supporting, any, other, file, formats, or, information, upload, since, 1992, a, new, document, was, written, to, specify, the, evolution, of, the, basic, protocol, towards, its, next, full, version, it, supported, both, the, simple, request, method, of, the, 0, 9, version, and, the, full, get, request, that, included, the, client, http, version, this, was, the, first, of, the, many, unofficial, http, 1, 0, drafts, that, preceded, the, final, work, on, http, 1, 0, after, having, decided, that, new, features, of, http, protocol, were, required, and, that, they, had, to, be, fully, documented, as, official, rfcs, in, early, 1995, the, http, working, group, http, wg, led, by, dave, raggett, was, constituted, with, the, aim, to, standardize, and, expand, the, protocol, with, extended, operations, extended, negotiation, richer, meta, information, tied, with, a, security, protocol, which, became, more, efficient, by, adding, additional, methods, and, header, fields, the, http, wg, planned, to, revise, and, publish, new, versions, of, the, protocol, as, http, 1, 0, and, http, 1, 1, within, 1995, but, because, of, the, many, revisions, that, timeline, lasted, much, more, than, one, year, the, http, wg, planned, also, to, specify, a, far, future, version, of, http, called, http, ng, http, next, generation, that, would, have, solved, all, remaining, problems, of, previous, versions, related, to, performances, low, latency, responses, etc, but, this, work, started, only, a, few, years, later, and, it, was, never, completed, in, may, 1996, rfc, 1945, was, published, as, a, final, http, 1, 0, revision, of, what, had, been, used, in, previous, 4, years, as, a, pre, standard, http, 1, 0, draft, which, was, already, used, by, many, web, browsers, and, web, servers, in, early, 1996, developers, started, to, even, include, unofficial, extensions, of, the, http, 1, 0, protocol, i, e, keep, alive, connections, etc, into, their, products, by, using, drafts, of, the, upcoming, http, 1, 1, specifications, since, early, 1996, major, web, browsers, and, web, server, developers, also, started, to, implement, new, features, specified, by, pre, standard, http, 1, 1, drafts, specifications, end, user, adoption, of, the, new, versions, of, browsers, and, servers, was, rapid, in, march, 1996, one, web, hosting, company, reported, that, over, 40, of, browsers, in, use, on, the, internet, used, the, new, http, 1, 1, header, host, to, enable, virtual, hosting, and, that, by, june, 1996, 65, of, all, browsers, accessing, their, servers, were, pre, standard, http, 1, 1, compliant, in, january, 1997, rfc, 2068, was, officially, released, as, http, 1, 1, specifications, in, june, 1999, rfc, 2616, was, released, to, include, all, improvements, and, updates, based, on, previous, obsolete, http, 1, 1, specifications, resuming, the, old, 1995, plan, of, previous, http, working, group, in, 1997, an, http, ng, working, group, was, formed, to, develop, a, new, http, protocol, named, http, ng, http, new, generation, a, few, proposals, drafts, were, produced, for, the, new, protocol, to, use, multiplexing, of, http, transactions, inside, a, single, tcp, ip, connection, but, in, 1999, the, group, stopped, its, activity, passing, the, technical, problems, to, ietf, in, 2007, the, ietf, http, working, group, http, wg, bis, or, httpbis, was, restarted, firstly, to, revise, and, clarify, previous, http, 1, 1, specifications, and, secondly, to, write, and, refine, future, http, 2, specifications, named, httpbis, in, 2009, google, a, private, company, announced, that, it, had, developed, and, tested, a, new, http, binary, protocol, named, spdy, the, implicit, aim, was, to, greatly, speed, up, web, traffic, specially, between, future, web, browsers, and, its, servers, spdy, was, indeed, much, faster, than, http, 1, 1, in, many, tests, and, so, it, was, quickly, adopted, by, chromium, and, then, by, other, major, web, browsers, some, of, the, ideas, about, multiplexing, http, streams, over, a, single, tcp, ip, connection, were, taken, from, various, sources, including, the, work, of, w3c, http, ng, working, group, in, january, march, 2012, http, working, group, httpbis, announced, the, need, to, start, to, focus, on, a, new, http, 2, protocol, while, finishing, the, revision, of, http, 1, 1, specifications, maybe, taking, in, consideration, ideas, and, work, done, for, spdy, after, a, few, months, about, what, to, do, to, develop, a, new, version, of, http, it, was, decided, to, derive, it, from, spdy, in, may, 2015, http, 2, was, published, as, rfc, 7540, and, quickly, adopted, by, all, web, browsers, already, supporting, spdy, and, more, slowly, by, web, servers, in, june, 2014, the, http, working, group, released, an, updated, six, part, http, 1, 1, specification, obsoleting, rfc, 2616, in, rfc, 7230, appendix, a, http, 0, 9, was, deprecated, for, servers, supporting, http, 1, 1, version, and, higher, since, http, 0, 9, did, not, support, header, fields, in, a, request, there, is, no, mechanism, for, it, to, support, name, based, virtual, hosts, selection, of, resource, by, inspection, of, the, host, header, field, any, server, that, implements, name, based, virtual, hosts, ought, to, disable, support, for, http, 0, 9, most, requests, that, appear, to, be, http, 0, 9, are, in, fact, badly, constructed, http, 1, x, requests, caused, by, a, client, failing, to, properly, encode, the, request, target, since, 2016, many, product, managers, and, developers, of, user, agents, browsers, etc, and, web, servers, have, begun, planning, to, gradually, deprecate, and, dismiss, support, for, http, 0, 9, protocol, mainly, for, the, following, reasons, in, 2020, the, first, drafts, http, 3, were, published, and, major, web, browsers, and, web, servers, started, to, adopt, it, on, 6, june, 2022, ietf, standardized, http, 3, as, rfc, 9114, in, june, 2022, a, batch, of, rfcs, was, published, deprecating, many, of, the, previous, documents, and, introducing, a, few, minor, changes, and, a, refactoring, of, http, semantics, description, into, a, separate, document, http, is, a, stateless, application, level, protocol, and, it, requires, a, reliable, network, transport, connection, to, exchange, data, between, client, and, server, in, http, implementations, tcp, ip, connections, are, used, using, well, known, ports, typically, port, 80, if, the, connection, is, unencrypted, or, port, 443, if, the, connection, is, encrypted, see, also, list, of, tcp, and, udp, port, numbers, in, http, 2, a, tcp, ip, connection, plus, multiple, protocol, channels, are, used, in, http, 3, the, application, transport, protocol, quic, over, udp, is, used, data, is, exchanged, through, a, sequence, of, request, response, messages, which, are, exchanged, by, a, session, layer, transport, connection, an, http, client, initially, tries, to, connect, to, a, server, establishing, a, connection, real, or, virtual, an, http, s, server, listening, on, that, port, accepts, the, connection, and, then, waits, for, a, client, s, request, message, the, client, sends, its, http, request, message, upon, receiving, the, request, the, server, sends, back, an, http, response, message, which, includes, header, s, plus, a, body, if, it, is, required, the, body, of, this, response, message, is, typically, the, requested, resource, although, an, error, message, or, other, information, may, also, be, returned, at, any, time, for, many, reasons, client, or, server, can, close, the, connection, closing, a, connection, is, usually, advertised, in, advance, by, using, one, or, more, http, headers, in, the, last, request, response, message, sent, to, server, or, client, in, http, 0, 9, the, tcp, ip, connection, is, always, closed, after, server, response, has, been, sent, so, it, is, never, persistent, in, http, 1, 0, as, stated, in, rfc, 1945, the, tcp, ip, connection, should, always, be, closed, by, server, after, a, response, has, been, sent, in, http, 1, 1, a, keep, alive, mechanism, was, officially, introduced, so, that, a, connection, could, be, reused, for, more, than, one, request, response, such, persistent, connections, reduce, request, latency, perceptibly, because, the, client, does, not, need, to, re, negotiate, the, tcp, 3, way, handshake, connection, after, the, first, request, has, been, sent, another, positive, side, effect, is, that, in, general, the, connection, becomes, faster, with, time, due, to, tcp, s, slow, start, mechanism, http, 1, 1, added, also, http, pipelining, in, order, to, further, reduce, lag, time, when, using, persistent, connections, by, allowing, clients, to, send, multiple, requests, before, waiting, for, each, response, this, optimization, was, never, considered, really, safe, because, a, few, web, servers, and, many, proxy, servers, specially, transparent, proxy, servers, placed, in, internet, intranets, between, clients, and, servers, did, not, handle, pipelined, requests, properly, they, served, only, the, first, request, discarding, the, others, they, closed, the, connection, because, they, saw, more, data, after, the, first, request, or, some, proxies, even, returned, responses, out, of, order, etc, because, of, this, only, head, and, some, get, requests, i, e, limited, to, real, file, requests, and, so, with, urls, without, query, string, used, as, a, command, etc, could, be, pipelined, in, a, safe, and, idempotent, mode, after, many, years, of, struggling, with, the, problems, introduced, by, enabling, pipelining, this, feature, was, first, disabled, and, then, removed, from, most, browsers, also, because, of, the, announced, adoption, of, http, 2, http, 2, extended, the, usage, of, persistent, connections, by, multiplexing, many, concurrent, requests, responses, through, a, single, tcp, ip, connection, http, 3, does, not, use, tcp, ip, connections, but, quic, udp, see, also, technical, overview, http, provides, multiple, authentication, schemes, such, as, basic, access, authentication, and, digest, access, authentication, which, operate, via, a, challenge, response, mechanism, whereby, the, server, identifies, and, issues, a, challenge, before, serving, the, requested, content, http, provides, a, general, framework, for, access, control, and, authentication, via, an, extensible, set, of, challenge, response, authentication, schemes, which, can, be, used, by, a, server, to, challenge, a, client, request, and, by, a, client, to, provide, authentication, information, the, authentication, mechanisms, described, above, belong, to, the, http, protocol, and, are, managed, by, client, and, server, http, software, if, configured, to, require, authentication, before, allowing, client, access, to, one, or, more, web, resources, and, not, by, the, web, applications, using, a, web, application, session, the, http, authentication, specification, also, provides, an, arbitrary, implementation, specific, construct, for, further, dividing, resources, common, to, a, given, root, uri, the, realm, value, string, if, present, is, combined, with, the, canonical, root, uri, to, form, the, protection, space, component, of, the, challenge, this, in, effect, allows, the, server, to, define, separate, authentication, scopes, under, one, root, uri, http, is, a, stateless, protocol, a, stateless, protocol, does, not, require, the, web, server, to, retain, information, or, status, about, each, user, for, the, duration, of, multiple, requests, some, web, applications, need, to, manage, user, sessions, so, they, implement, states, or, server, side, sessions, using, for, instance, http, cookies, or, hidden, variables, within, web, forms, to, start, an, application, user, session, an, interactive, authentication, via, web, application, login, must, be, performed, to, stop, a, user, session, a, logout, operation, must, be, requested, by, user, these, kind, of, operations, do, not, use, http, authentication, but, a, custom, managed, web, application, authentication, request, messages, are, sent, by, a, client, to, a, target, server, a, client, sends, request, messages, to, the, server, which, consist, of, in, the, http, 1, 1, protocol, all, header, fields, except, host, hostname, are, optional, a, request, line, containing, only, the, path, name, is, accepted, by, servers, to, maintain, compatibility, with, http, clients, before, the, http, 1, 0, specification, in, rfc, 1945, http, defines, methods, sometimes, referred, to, as, verbs, but, nowhere, in, the, specification, does, it, mention, verb, to, indicate, the, desired, action, to, be, performed, on, the, identified, resource, what, this, resource, represents, whether, pre, existing, data, or, data, that, is, generated, dynamically, depends, on, the, implementation, of, the, server, often, the, resource, corresponds, to, a, file, or, the, output, of, an, executable, residing, on, the, server, the, http, 1, 0, specification, defined, the, get, head, and, post, methods, as, well, as, listing, the, put, delete, link, and, unlink, methods, under, additional, methods, however, the, http, 1, 1, specification, formally, defined, and, added, five, new, methods, put, delete, connect, options, and, trace, any, client, can, use, any, method, and, the, server, can, be, configured, to, support, any, combination, of, methods, if, a, method, is, unknown, to, an, intermediate, it, will, be, treated, as, an, unsafe, and, non, idempotent, method, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, methods, that, can, be, defined, which, allows, for, future, methods, to, be, specified, without, breaking, existing, infrastructure, for, example, webdav, defined, seven, new, methods, and, rfc, 5789, specified, the, patch, method, method, names, are, case, sensitive, this, is, in, contrast, to, http, header, field, names, which, are, case, insensitive, all, general, purpose, web, servers, are, required, to, implement, at, least, the, get, and, head, methods, and, all, other, methods, are, considered, optional, by, the, specification, a, request, method, is, safe, if, a, request, with, that, method, has, no, intended, effect, on, the, server, the, methods, get, head, options, and, trace, are, defined, as, safe, in, other, words, safe, methods, are, intended, to, be, read, only, safe, methods, can, still, have, side, effects, not, seen, by, the, client, such, as, appending, request, information, to, a, log, file, or, charging, an, advertising, account, in, contrast, the, methods, post, put, delete, connect, and, patch, are, not, safe, they, may, modify, the, state, of, the, server, or, have, other, effects, such, as, sending, an, email, such, methods, are, therefore, not, usually, used, by, conforming, web, robots, or, web, crawlers, some, that, do, not, conform, tend, to, make, requests, without, regard, to, context, or, consequences, despite, the, prescribed, safety, of, get, requests, in, practice, their, handling, by, the, server, is, not, technically, limited, in, any, way, careless, or, deliberately, irregular, programming, can, allow, get, requests, to, cause, non, trivial, changes, on, the, server, this, is, discouraged, because, of, the, problems, which, can, occur, when, web, caching, search, engines, and, other, automated, agents, make, unintended, changes, on, the, server, for, example, a, website, might, allow, deletion, of, a, resource, through, a, url, such, as, https, example, com, article, 1234, delete, which, if, arbitrarily, fetched, even, using, get, would, simply, delete, the, article, a, properly, coded, website, would, require, a, delete, or, post, method, for, this, action, which, non, malicious, bots, would, not, make, one, example, of, this, occurring, in, practice, was, during, the, short, lived, google, web, accelerator, beta, which, prefetched, arbitrary, urls, on, the, page, a, user, was, viewing, causing, records, to, be, automatically, altered, or, deleted, en, masse, the, beta, was, suspended, only, weeks, after, its, first, release, following, widespread, criticism, a, request, method, is, idempotent, if, multiple, identical, requests, with, that, method, have, the, same, effect, as, a, single, such, request, the, methods, put, and, delete, and, safe, methods, are, defined, as, idempotent, safe, methods, are, trivially, idempotent, since, they, are, intended, to, have, no, effect, on, the, server, whatsoever, the, put, and, delete, methods, meanwhile, are, idempotent, since, successive, identical, requests, will, be, ignored, a, website, might, for, instance, set, up, a, put, endpoint, to, modify, a, user, s, recorded, email, address, if, this, endpoint, is, configured, correctly, any, requests, which, ask, to, change, a, user, s, email, address, to, the, same, email, address, which, is, already, recorded, e, g, duplicate, requests, following, a, successful, request, will, have, no, effect, similarly, a, request, to, delete, a, certain, user, will, have, no, effect, if, that, user, has, already, been, deleted, in, contrast, the, methods, post, connect, and, patch, are, not, necessarily, idempotent, and, therefore, sending, an, identical, post, request, multiple, times, may, further, modify, the, state, of, the, server, or, have, further, effects, such, as, sending, multiple, emails, in, some, cases, this, is, the, desired, effect, but, in, other, cases, it, may, occur, accidentally, a, user, might, for, example, inadvertently, send, multiple, post, requests, by, clicking, a, button, again, if, they, were, not, given, clear, feedback, that, the, first, click, was, being, processed, while, web, browsers, may, show, alert, dialog, boxes, to, warn, users, in, some, cases, where, reloading, a, page, may, re, submit, a, post, request, it, is, generally, up, to, the, web, application, to, handle, cases, where, a, post, request, should, not, be, submitted, more, than, once, note, that, whether, or, not, a, method, is, idempotent, is, not, enforced, by, the, protocol, or, web, server, it, is, perfectly, possible, to, write, a, web, application, in, which, for, example, a, database, insert, or, other, non, idempotent, action, is, triggered, by, a, get, or, other, request, to, do, so, against, recommendations, however, may, result, in, undesirable, consequences, if, a, user, agent, assumes, that, repeating, the, same, request, is, safe, when, it, is, not, a, request, method, is, cacheable, if, responses, to, requests, with, that, method, may, be, stored, for, future, reuse, the, methods, get, head, and, post, are, defined, as, cacheable, in, contrast, the, methods, put, delete, connect, options, trace, and, patch, are, not, cacheable, request, header, fields, allow, the, client, to, pass, additional, information, beyond, the, request, line, acting, as, request, modifiers, similarly, to, the, parameters, of, a, procedure, they, give, information, about, the, client, about, the, target, resource, or, about, the, expected, handling, of, the, request, a, response, message, is, sent, by, a, server, to, a, client, as, a, reply, to, its, former, request, message, a, server, sends, response, messages, to, the, client, which, consist, of, in, http, 1, 0, and, since, the, first, line, of, the, http, response, is, called, the, status, line, and, includes, a, numeric, status, code, such, as, 404, and, a, textual, reason, phrase, such, as, not, found, the, response, status, code, is, a, three, digit, integer, code, representing, the, result, of, the, server, s, attempt, to, understand, and, satisfy, the, client, s, corresponding, request, the, way, the, client, handles, the, response, depends, primarily, on, the, status, code, and, secondarily, on, the, other, response, header, fields, clients, may, not, understand, all, registered, status, codes, but, they, must, understand, their, class, given, by, the, first, digit, of, the, status, code, and, treat, an, unrecognized, status, code, as, being, equivalent, to, the, x00, status, code, of, that, class, the, standard, reason, phrases, are, only, recommendations, and, can, be, replaced, with, local, equivalents, at, the, web, developer, s, discretion, if, the, status, code, indicated, a, problem, the, user, agent, might, display, the, reason, phrase, to, the, user, to, provide, further, information, about, the, nature, of, the, problem, the, standard, also, allows, the, user, agent, to, attempt, to, interpret, the, reason, phrase, though, this, might, be, unwise, since, the, standard, explicitly, specifies, that, status, codes, are, machine, readable, and, reason, phrases, are, human, readable, the, first, digit, of, the, status, code, defines, its, class, the, response, header, fields, allow, the, server, to, pass, additional, information, beyond, the, status, line, acting, as, response, modifiers, they, give, information, about, the, server, or, about, further, access, to, the, target, resource, or, related, resources, each, response, header, field, has, a, defined, meaning, which, can, be, further, refined, by, the, semantics, of, the, request, method, or, response, status, code, below, is, a, sample, http, transaction, between, an, http, 1, 1, client, and, an, http, 1, 1, server, running, on, www, example, com, port, 80, a, client, request, consisting, in, this, case, of, the, request, line, and, a, few, headers, that, can, be, reduced, to, only, the, host, hostname, header, is, followed, by, a, blank, line, so, that, the, request, ends, with, a, double, end, of, line, each, in, the, form, of, a, carriage, return, followed, by, a, line, feed, the, host, hostname, header, value, distinguishes, between, various, dns, names, sharing, a, single, ip, address, allowing, name, based, virtual, hosting, while, optional, in, http, 1, 0, it, is, mandatory, in, http, 1, 1, a, slash, will, usually, fetch, a, index, html, file, if, there, is, one, the, etag, entity, tag, header, field, is, used, to, determine, if, a, cached, version, of, the, requested, resource, is, identical, to, the, current, version, of, the, resource, on, the, server, content, type, specifies, the, internet, media, type, of, the, data, conveyed, by, the, http, message, while, content, length, indicates, its, length, in, bytes, the, http, 1, 1, webserver, publishes, its, ability, to, respond, to, requests, for, certain, byte, ranges, of, the, document, by, setting, the, field, accept, ranges, bytes, this, is, useful, if, the, client, needs, to, have, only, certain, portions, of, a, resource, sent, by, the, server, which, is, called, byte, serving, when, connection, close, is, sent, it, means, that, the, web, server, will, close, the, tcp, connection, immediately, after, the, end, of, the, transfer, of, this, response, most, of, the, header, lines, are, optional, but, some, are, mandatory, when, header, content, length, number, is, missing, in, a, response, with, an, entity, body, then, this, should, be, considered, an, error, in, http, 1, 0, but, it, may, not, be, an, error, in, http, 1, 1, if, header, transfer, encoding, chunked, is, present, chunked, transfer, encoding, uses, a, chunk, size, of, 0, to, mark, the, end, of, the, content, some, old, implementations, of, http, 1, 0, omitted, the, header, content, length, when, the, length, of, the, body, entity, was, not, known, at, the, beginning, of, the, response, and, so, the, transfer, of, data, to, client, continued, until, server, closed, the, socket, a, content, encoding, gzip, can, be, used, to, inform, the, client, that, the, body, entity, part, of, the, transmitted, data, is, compressed, by, gzip, algorithm, the, most, popular, way, of, establishing, an, encrypted, http, connection, is, https, two, other, methods, for, establishing, an, encrypted, http, connection, also, exist, secure, hypertext, transfer, protocol, and, using, the, http, 1, 1, upgrade, header, to, specify, an, upgrade, to, tls, browser, support, for, these, two, is, however, nearly, non, existent
