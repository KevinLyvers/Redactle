a, vacuum, cleaner, also, known, simply, as, a, vacuum, is, a, device, that, uses, suction, and, often, agitation, in, order, to, remove, dirt, and, other, debris, from, carpets, and, hard, floors, the, dirt, is, collected, into, a, dust, bag, or, a, plastic, bin, vacuum, cleaners, which, are, used, in, homes, as, well, as, in, commercial, settings, exist, in, a, variety, of, sizes, and, types, including, stick, vacuums, handheld, vacuums, upright, vacuums, and, canister, vacuums, specialized, shop, vacuums, can, be, used, to, clean, both, solid, debris, and, liquids, although, vacuum, cleaner, and, the, short, form, vacuum, are, neutral, names, in, some, countries, uk, ireland, hoover, is, used, instead, as, a, genericized, trademark, and, as, a, verb, the, name, comes, from, the, hoover, company, one, of, the, first, and, most, influential, companies, in, the, development, of, the, device, in, new, zealand, particularly, the, southland, region, it, is, sometimes, called, a, lux, likewise, a, genericized, trademark, and, used, as, a, verb, the, device, is, also, sometimes, called, a, sweeper, although, the, same, term, also, refers, to, a, carpet, sweeper, a, similar, invention, the, vacuum, cleaner, evolved, from, the, carpet, sweeper, via, manual, vacuum, cleaners, the, first, manual, models, using, bellows, were, developed, in, the, 1860s, and, the, first, motorized, designs, appeared, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, first, decade, being, the, boom, decade, in, 1860, a, manual, vacuum, cleaner, was, invented, by, daniel, hess, of, west, union, iowa, called, a, carpet, sweeper, it, gathered, dust, with, a, rotating, brush, and, had, a, bellows, for, generating, suction, another, early, model, 1869, was, the, whirlwind, invented, in, chicago, in, 1868, by, ives, w, mcgaffey, the, bulky, device, worked, with, a, belt, driven, fan, cranked, by, hand, that, made, it, awkward, to, operate, although, it, was, commercially, marketed, with, mixed, success, a, similar, model, was, constructed, by, melville, r, bissell, of, grand, rapids, michigan, in, 1876, who, also, manufactured, carpet, sweepers, the, company, later, added, portable, vacuum, cleaners, to, its, line, of, cleaning, tools, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, introduction, of, powered, cleaners, although, early, types, used, some, variation, of, blowing, air, to, clean, instead, of, suction, one, appeared, in, 1898, when, john, s, thurman, of, st, louis, missouri, submitted, a, patent, u, s, no, 634, 042, for, a, pneumatic, carpet, renovator, which, blew, dust, into, a, receptacle, thurman, s, system, powered, by, an, internal, combustion, engine, traveled, to, the, customer, s, residence, on, a, horse, drawn, wagon, as, part, of, a, door, to, door, cleaning, service, corrine, dufour, of, savannah, georgia, received, two, patents, in, 1899, and, 1900, for, another, blown, air, system, that, seems, to, have, featured, the, first, use, of, an, electric, motor, in, 1901, powered, vacuum, cleaners, using, suction, were, invented, independently, by, british, engineer, hubert, cecil, booth, and, american, inventor, david, t, kenney, booth, also, may, have, coined, the, word, vacuum, cleaner, booth, s, horse, drawn, combustion, engine, powered, puffing, billy, maybe, derived, from, thurman, s, blown, air, design, relied, upon, just, suction, with, air, pumped, through, a, cloth, filter, and, was, offered, as, part, of, his, cleaning, services, kenney, s, was, a, stationary, 4, 000, lb, 1, 800, kg, steam, engine, powered, system, with, pipes, and, hoses, reaching, into, all, parts, of, the, building, the, first, vacuum, cleaning, device, to, be, portable, and, marketed, at, the, domestic, market, was, built, in, 1905, by, walter, griffiths, a, manufacturer, in, birmingham, england, his, griffith, s, improved, vacuum, apparatus, for, removing, dust, from, carpets, resembled, modern, day, cleaners, it, was, portable, easy, to, store, and, powered, by, any, one, person, such, as, the, ordinary, domestic, servant, who, would, have, the, task, of, compressing, a, bellows, like, contraption, to, suck, up, dust, through, a, removable, flexible, pipe, to, which, a, variety, of, shaped, nozzles, could, be, attached, in, 1906, james, b, kirby, developed, his, first, of, many, vacuums, called, the, domestic, cyclone, it, used, water, for, dirt, separation, later, revisions, came, to, be, known, as, the, kirby, vacuum, cleaner, the, cleveland, ohio, factory, was, built, in, 1916, and, remains, open, currently, and, all, kirby, vacuum, cleaners, are, manufactured, in, the, united, states, in, 1907, department, store, janitor, james, murray, spangler, 1848, 1915, of, canton, ohio, invented, the, first, portable, electric, vacuum, cleaner, obtaining, a, patent, for, the, electric, suction, sweeper, on, 2, june, 1908, crucially, in, addition, to, suction, from, an, electric, fan, that, blew, the, dirt, and, dust, into, a, soap, box, and, one, of, his, wife, s, pillow, cases, spangler, s, design, utilized, a, rotating, brush, to, loosen, debris, unable, to, produce, the, design, himself, due, to, lack, of, funding, he, sold, the, patent, in, 1908, to, local, leather, goods, manufacturer, william, henry, hoover, 1849, 1932, who, had, spangler, s, machine, redesigned, with, a, steel, casing, casters, and, attachments, founding, the, company, that, in, 1922, was, renamed, the, hoover, company, their, first, vacuum, was, the, 1908, model, o, which, sold, for, 60, 2, 035, in, 2023, dollars, subsequent, innovations, included, the, beater, bar, in, 1919, it, beats, as, it, sweeps, as, it, cleans, disposal, filter, bags, in, the, 1920s, and, an, upright, vacuum, cleaner, in, 1926, in, continental, europe, the, fisker, and, nielsen, company, in, denmark, was, the, first, to, sell, vacuum, cleaners, in, 1910, the, design, weighed, just, 17, 5, kg, 39, lb, and, could, be, operated, by, a, single, person, the, swedish, company, electrolux, launched, their, model, v, in, 1921, with, the, innovation, of, being, able, to, lie, on, the, floor, on, two, thin, metal, runners, in, the, 1930s, the, german, company, vorwerk, started, marketing, vacuum, cleaners, of, their, own, design, which, they, sold, through, direct, sales, for, many, years, after, their, introduction, vacuum, cleaners, remained, a, luxury, item, but, after, the, second, world, war, they, became, common, among, the, middle, classes, vacuums, tend, to, be, more, common, in, western, countries, because, in, most, other, parts, of, the, world, wall, to, wall, carpeting, is, uncommon, and, homes, have, tile, or, hardwood, floors, which, are, easily, swept, wiped, or, mopped, manually, without, power, assist, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, more, widespread, use, of, technologies, developed, earlier, including, filterless, cyclonic, dirt, separation, central, vacuum, systems, and, rechargeable, hand, held, vacuums, in, addition, miniaturized, computer, technology, and, improved, batteries, allowed, the, development, of, a, new, type, of, machine, the, autonomous, robotic, vacuum, cleaner, in, 1997, electrolux, of, sweden, demonstrated, the, electrolux, trilobite, the, first, autonomous, cordless, robotic, vacuum, cleaner, on, the, bbc, tv, program, tomorrow, s, world, introducing, it, to, the, consumer, market, in, 2001, a, wide, variety, of, technologies, designs, and, configurations, are, available, for, both, domestic, and, commercial, cleaning, jobs, upright, vacuum, cleaners, are, popular, in, the, us, uk, and, numerous, commonwealth, countries, but, unusual, in, some, continental, european, countries, they, take, the, form, of, a, cleaning, head, onto, which, a, handle, and, bag, are, attached, upright, designs, generally, employ, a, rotating, brushroll, or, beater, bar, which, removes, dirt, through, a, combination, of, sweeping, and, vibration, there, are, two, types, of, upright, vacuums, dirty, air, direct, fan, found, mostly, on, commercial, vacuums, or, clean, air, fan, bypass, found, on, most, of, today, s, domestic, vacuums, the, older, of, the, two, designs, direct, fan, cleaners, have, a, large, impeller, fan, mounted, close, to, the, suction, opening, through, which, the, dirt, passes, directly, before, being, blown, into, a, bag, the, motor, is, often, cooled, by, a, separate, cooling, fan, because, of, their, large, bladed, fans, and, comparatively, short, airpaths, direct, fan, cleaners, create, a, very, efficient, airflow, from, a, low, amount, of, power, and, make, effective, carpet, cleaners, their, above, floor, cleaning, power, is, less, efficient, since, the, airflow, is, lost, when, it, passes, through, a, long, hose, and, the, fan, has, been, optimized, for, airflow, volume, and, not, suction, fan, bypass, uprights, have, their, motor, mounted, after, the, filter, bag, dust, is, removed, from, the, airstream, by, the, bag, and, usually, a, filter, before, it, passes, through, the, fan, the, fans, are, smaller, and, are, usually, a, combination, of, several, moving, and, stationary, turbines, working, in, sequence, to, boost, power, the, motor, is, cooled, by, the, airstream, passing, through, it, fan, bypass, vacuums, are, good, for, both, carpet, and, above, floor, cleaning, since, their, suction, does, not, significantly, diminish, over, the, distance, of, a, hose, as, it, does, in, direct, fan, cleaners, however, their, air, paths, are, much, less, efficient, and, can, require, more, than, twice, as, much, power, as, direct, fan, cleaners, to, achieve, the, same, results, the, most, common, upright, vacuum, cleaners, use, a, drive, belt, powered, by, the, suction, motor, to, rotate, the, brush, roll, however, a, more, common, design, of, dual, motor, upright, is, available, in, these, cleaners, the, suction, is, provided, via, a, large, motor, while, the, brushroll, is, powered, by, a, separate, smaller, motor, which, does, not, create, any, suction, the, brush, roll, motor, can, sometimes, be, switched, off, so, hard, floors, can, be, cleaned, without, the, brush, roll, scattering, the, dirt, it, may, also, have, an, automatic, cut, off, feature, which, shuts, the, motor, off, if, the, brush, roll, becomes, jammed, protecting, it, from, damage, canister, models, in, the, uk, also, often, called, cylinder, models, dominate, the, european, market, they, have, the, motor, and, dust, collectors, using, a, bag, or, bagless, in, a, separate, unit, usually, mounted, on, wheels, which, is, connected, to, the, vacuum, head, by, a, flexible, hose, their, main, advantage, is, flexibility, as, the, user, can, attach, different, heads, for, different, tasks, and, maneuverability, the, head, can, reach, under, furniture, and, makes, it, very, easy, to, vacuum, stairs, and, vertical, surfaces, many, cylinder, models, have, power, heads, as, standard, or, add, on, equipment, containing, the, same, sort, of, mechanical, beaters, as, in, upright, units, making, them, as, efficient, on, carpets, as, upright, models, such, beaters, are, driven, by, a, separate, electric, motor, or, a, turbine, which, uses, the, suction, power, to, spin, the, brushroll, via, a, drive, belt, drum, or, shop, vac, models, are, essentially, heavy, duty, industrial, versions, of, cylinder, vacuum, cleaners, where, the, canister, consists, of, a, large, vertically, positioned, drum, which, can, be, stationary, or, on, wheels, smaller, versions, for, use, in, garages, or, small, workshops, are, usually, electrically, powered, larger, models, which, can, store, over, 200, litres, 44, imp, gal, 53, us, gal, are, often, hooked, up, to, compressed, air, utilizing, the, venturi, effect, to, produce, a, partial, vacuum, built, in, dust, collection, systems, are, also, used, in, many, workshops, wet, or, wet, dry, vacuum, cleaners, are, a, specialized, form, of, cylinder, drum, models, that, can, be, used, to, clean, up, wet, or, liquid, spills, they, are, generally, designed, to, be, used, both, indoors, and, outdoors, and, to, accommodate, both, wet, and, dry, debris, some, are, also, equipped, with, an, exhaust, port, or, detachable, blower, for, reversing, the, airflow, a, useful, function, for, everything, from, clearing, a, clogged, hose, to, blowing, dust, into, a, corner, for, easy, collection, shop, vacs, are, able, to, collect, large, bulky, or, otherwise, inconvenient, material, that, would, damage, or, foul, household, vacuum, cleaners, like, sawdust, swarf, and, liquids, they, use, wide, hoses, which, open, directly, into, the, collection, chamber, usually, a, bucket, like, cylinder, constituting, the, body, of, the, vacuum, as, the, airstream, enters, the, larger, volume, its, flow, slows, down, allowing, the, material, to, drop, into, the, chamber, before, air, is, sucked, out, through, the, filter, and, to, the, vacuum, s, exhaust, shop, vacs, performance, can, be, evaluated, by, a, number, of, metrics, commonly, used, ones, include, the, motor, s, rating, using, power, measurements, like, watts, or, horsepower, the, vacuum, s, ability, to, develop, suction, using, pressure, measurements, like, inches, of, water, and, total, airflow, through, the, system, using, volume, rate, measurements, like, cubic, feet, per, minute, related, to, the, wet, vacuum, is, the, extraction, vacuum, cleaner, used, mainly, in, hot, water, extraction, a, method, of, cleaning, hard, to, move, pieces, of, fabric, like, carpets, these, machines, are, able, to, spray, hot, soapy, water, and, then, suck, it, back, out, of, the, fabric, removing, dirt, in, the, process, wet, vacuum, cleaner, have, been, modified, by, end, users, adding, an, internally, mounted, sump, pump, for, continuous, removal, of, liquids, without, having, to, stop, to, empty, the, tank, pneumatic, or, pneumatic, wet, dry, vacuum, cleaners, are, a, specialized, form, of, wet, dry, models, that, hook, up, to, compressed, air, they, commonly, can, accommodate, both, wet, and, dry, soilage, a, useful, feature, in, industrial, plants, and, manufacturing, facilities, backpack, vacuum, cleaners, are, commonly, used, for, commercial, cleaning, they, allow, the, user, to, move, rapidly, about, a, large, area, they, are, essentially, small, canister, vacuums, strapped, onto, the, user, s, back, lightweight, hand, held, vacuum, cleaners, either, powered, from, rechargeable, batteries, or, mains, power, are, also, popular, for, cleaning, up, smaller, spills, frequently, seen, examples, include, the, black, decker, dustbuster, which, was, introduced, in, 1979, and, numerous, handheld, models, by, dirt, devil, which, were, first, introduced, in, 1984, some, battery, powered, handheld, vacuums, are, wet, dry, rated, the, appliance, must, be, partially, disassembled, and, cleaned, after, picking, up, wet, materials, to, avoid, developing, unpleasant, odors, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, several, companies, developed, robotic, vacuum, cleaners, a, form, of, carpet, sweeper, usually, equipped, with, limited, suction, power, some, prominent, brands, are, roomba, neato, and, bobsweep, these, machines, move, autonomously, while, collecting, surface, dust, and, debris, into, a, dustbin, they, can, usually, navigate, around, furniture, and, come, back, to, a, docking, station, to, charge, their, batteries, and, a, few, are, able, to, empty, their, dust, containers, into, the, dock, as, well, most, models, are, equipped, with, motorized, brushes, and, a, vacuum, motor, to, collect, dust, and, debris, while, most, robotic, vacuum, cleaners, are, designed, for, home, use, some, models, are, appropriate, for, operation, in, offices, hotels, hospitals, etc, in, december, 2009, neato, robotics, launched, the, world, s, first, robotic, vacuum, cleaner, which, uses, a, rotating, laser, based, range, finder, a, form, of, lidar, to, scan, and, map, its, surrounding, it, uses, this, map, to, clean, the, floor, methodically, even, if, it, requires, the, robot, to, return, to, its, base, multiple, times, to, recharge, itself, in, many, cases, it, will, notice, when, an, area, of, the, floor, that, was, previously, inaccessible, becomes, reachable, such, as, when, a, dog, wakes, up, from, a, nap, and, return, to, vacuum, that, area, portable, vacuum, cleaners, working, on, the, cyclonic, separation, principle, became, popular, in, the, 1990s, this, dirt, separation, principle, was, well, known, and, often, used, in, central, vacuum, systems, cleveland, s, p, a, geier, company, had, obtained, a, patent, on, a, cyclonic, vacuum, cleaner, as, early, as, 1928, which, was, later, sold, to, health, mor, in, 1939, introducing, the, filter, queen, cyclonic, canister, vacuum, cleaner, in, 1979, james, dyson, introduced, a, portable, unit, with, cyclonic, separation, adapting, this, design, from, industrial, saw, mills, he, launched, his, cyclone, cleaner, first, in, japan, in, the, 1980s, at, a, cost, of, about, us, 1800, and, in, 1993, released, the, dyson, dc01, upright, in, the, uk, for, 200, critics, expected, that, people, would, not, buy, a, vacuum, cleaner, at, twice, the, price, of, a, conventional, unit, but, the, dyson, design, later, became, the, most, popular, cleaner, in, the, uk, cyclonic, cleaners, do, not, use, filtration, bags, instead, the, dust, is, separated, in, a, detachable, cylindrical, collection, vessel, or, bin, air, and, dust, are, sucked, at, high, speed, into, the, collection, vessel, at, a, direction, tangential, to, the, vessel, wall, creating, a, fast, spinning, vortex, the, dust, particles, and, other, debris, move, to, the, outside, of, the, vessel, by, centrifugal, force, where, they, fall, due, to, gravity, in, fixed, installation, central, vacuum, cleaners, the, cleaned, air, may, be, exhausted, directly, outside, without, need, for, further, filtration, a, well, designed, cyclonic, filtration, system, loses, suction, power, due, to, airflow, restriction, only, when, the, collection, vessel, is, almost, full, this, is, in, marked, contrast, to, filter, bag, systems, which, lose, suction, when, pores, in, the, filter, become, clogged, as, dirt, and, dust, are, collected, in, portable, cyclonic, models, the, cleaned, air, from, the, center, of, the, vortex, is, expelled, from, the, machine, after, passing, through, a, number, of, successively, finer, filters, at, the, top, of, the, container, the, first, filter, is, intended, to, trap, particles, which, could, damage, the, subsequent, filters, that, remove, fine, dust, particles, the, filters, must, regularly, be, cleaned, or, replaced, to, ensure, that, the, machine, continues, to, perform, efficiently, since, dyson, s, success, in, raising, public, awareness, of, cyclonic, separation, several, other, companies, have, introduced, cyclone, models, competing, manufacturers, include, hoover, bissell, bosch, eureka, electrolux, and, vax, this, high, level, of, competition, means, the, cheapest, models, are, generally, no, more, expensive, than, a, conventional, cleaner, central, vacuum, cleaners, also, known, as, built, in, or, ducted, are, a, type, of, canister, cylinder, model, which, has, the, motor, and, dirt, filtration, unit, located, in, a, central, location, in, a, building, and, connected, by, pipes, to, fixed, vacuum, inlets, installed, throughout, the, building, only, the, hose, and, cleaning, head, need, be, carried, from, room, to, room, and, the, hose, is, commonly, 8, m, 25, ft, long, allowing, a, large, range, of, movement, without, changing, vacuum, inlets, plastic, or, metal, piping, connects, the, inlets, to, the, central, unit, the, vacuum, head, may, be, unpowered, or, have, beaters, operated, by, an, electric, motor, or, by, an, air, driven, turbine, the, dirt, bag, or, collection, bin, in, a, central, vacuum, system, is, usually, so, large, that, emptying, or, changing, needs, to, be, done, less, often, perhaps, a, few, times, per, year, for, an, ordinary, household, the, central, unit, usually, stays, in, stand, by, and, is, turned, on, by, a, switch, on, the, handle, of, the, hose, alternately, the, unit, powers, up, when, the, hose, is, plugged, into, the, wall, inlet, when, the, metal, hose, connector, makes, contact, with, two, prongs, in, the, wall, inlet, and, control, current, is, transmitted, through, low, voltage, wires, to, the, main, unit, a, central, vacuum, typically, produces, greater, suction, than, common, portable, vacuum, cleaners, because, a, larger, fan, and, more, powerful, motor, can, be, used, when, they, are, not, required, to, be, portable, a, cyclonic, separation, system, if, used, does, not, lose, suction, as, the, collection, container, fills, up, until, the, container, is, nearly, full, this, is, in, marked, contrast, to, filter, bag, designs, which, start, losing, suction, immediately, as, pores, in, the, filter, become, clogged, by, accumulated, dirt, and, dust, a, benefit, to, allergy, sufferers, is, that, unlike, a, standard, vacuum, cleaner, which, must, blow, some, of, the, dirt, collected, back, into, the, room, being, cleaned, no, matter, how, efficient, its, filtration, a, central, vacuum, removes, all, the, dirt, collected, to, the, central, unit, since, this, central, unit, is, usually, located, outside, the, living, area, no, dust, is, recirculated, back, into, the, room, being, cleaned, also, it, is, possible, on, most, newer, models, to, vent, the, exhaust, entirely, outside, even, with, the, unit, inside, the, living, quarters, another, benefit, of, the, central, vacuum, is, because, of, the, remote, location, of, the, motor, unit, there, is, much, less, noise, in, the, room, being, cleaned, than, with, a, standard, vacuum, cleaner, introduced, in, 1954, the, hoover, company, s, constellation, was, of, the, cylinder, type, and, lacked, wheels, instead, the, vacuum, cleaner, floated, on, its, exhaust, operating, as, a, hovercraft, although, that, was, not, true, of, the, earliest, models, which, had, a, rotating, hose, the, intention, being, that, the, user, would, place, the, unit, in, the, center, of, the, room, and, work, around, the, cleaner, the, constellation, was, changed, and, updated, over, the, years, until, discontinued, in, 1975, later, constellations, routed, all, of, the, exhaust, under, the, vacuum, using, an, airfoil, the, updated, design, was, quiet, even, by, modern, standards, particularly, on, carpet, because, it, muffled, the, sound, those, models, float, on, carpet, or, bare, floor, although, on, hard, flooring, the, exhaust, air, tends, to, scatter, any, fluff, or, debris, around, hoover, re, released, an, updated, version, of, the, later, model, constellation, in, the, us, model, s3341, in, pearl, white, and, s3345, in, stainless, steel, changes, included, a, hepa, filtration, bag, a, 12, amp, motor, a, turbine, powered, brush, roll, and, a, redesigned, version, of, the, handle, the, same, model, was, marketed, in, the, uk, under, the, maytag, brand, called, the, satellite, because, of, licensing, restrictions, it, was, sold, from, 2006, to, 2009, see, vacuum, truck, for, very, big, vacuum, cleaners, mounted, on, vehicles, some, other, vacuum, cleaners, include, an, electric, mop, in, the, same, machine, for, a, dry, and, a, later, wet, clean, the, irobot, company, developed, the, scooba, a, robotic, wet, vacuum, cleaner, that, carries, its, own, cleaning, solution, applies, it, and, scrubs, the, floor, and, vacuums, the, dirty, water, into, a, collection, tank, a, vacuum, s, suction, is, caused, by, a, difference, in, air, pressure, a, fan, driven, by, an, electric, motor, often, a, universal, motor, reduces, the, pressure, inside, the, machine, atmospheric, pressure, then, pushes, the, air, through, the, carpet, and, into, the, nozzle, and, so, the, dust, is, literally, pushed, into, the, bag, tests, have, shown, that, vacuuming, can, kill, 100, of, young, fleas, and, 96, of, adult, fleas, vacuums, by, their, nature, cause, dust, to, become, airborne, by, exhausting, air, that, is, not, completely, filtered, this, can, cause, health, problems, since, the, operator, ends, up, inhaling, respirable, dust, which, is, also, redeposited, into, the, area, being, cleaned, there, are, several, methods, manufacturers, use, to, control, this, problem, some, of, which, may, be, combined, in, a, single, appliance, typically, a, filter, is, positioned, so, that, the, incoming, air, passes, through, it, before, it, reaches, the, fan, and, then, the, filtered, air, passes, through, the, motor, for, cooling, purposes, some, other, designs, use, a, completely, separate, air, intake, for, cooling, it, is, nearly, impossible, for, a, practical, air, filter, to, completely, remove, all, ultrafine, particles, from, a, dirt, laden, airstream, an, ultra, efficient, air, filter, will, immediately, clog, up, and, become, ineffective, during, everyday, use, and, practical, filters, are, a, compromise, between, filtering, effectiveness, and, restriction, of, airflow, one, way, to, sidestep, this, problem, is, to, exhaust, partially, filtered, air, to, the, outdoors, which, is, a, design, feature, of, some, central, vacuum, systems, specially, engineered, portable, vacuums, may, also, utilize, this, design, but, are, more, awkward, to, set, up, and, use, requiring, temporary, installation, of, a, separate, exhaust, hose, to, an, exterior, window, ordinary, vacuum, cleaners, should, never, be, used, to, clean, up, asbestos, fibers, even, if, fitted, with, a, hepa, filter, specially, designed, machines, are, required, to, safely, clean, up, asbestos, most, vacuum, cleaners, are, supplied, with, numerous, specialized, attachments, such, as, tools, brushes, and, extension, wands, which, allow, them, to, reach, otherwise, inaccessible, places, or, to, be, used, for, cleaning, a, variety, of, surfaces, the, most, common, of, these, tools, are, the, performance, of, a, vacuum, cleaner, can, be, measured, by, several, parameters, other, specifications, of, a, vacuum, cleaner, are, the, suction, is, the, maximum, pressure, difference, that, the, pump, can, create, for, example, a, typical, domestic, model, has, a, suction, of, about, negative, 20, kpa, this, means, that, it, can, lower, the, pressure, inside, the, hose, from, normal, atmospheric, pressure, about, 100, kpa, by, 20, kpa, the, higher, the, suction, rating, the, more, powerful, the, cleaner, one, inch, of, water, is, equivalent, to, about, 249, pa, hence, the, typical, suction, is, 80, inches, 2, 000, mm, of, water, the, power, consumption, of, a, vacuum, cleaner, in, watts, is, often, the, only, figure, stated, many, north, american, vacuum, manufacturers, give, the, current, only, in, amperes, e, g, 6, amps, and, the, consumer, is, left, to, multiply, that, by, the, line, voltage, of, 120, volts, to, get, the, approximate, power, ratings, in, watts, the, rated, input, power, does, not, indicate, the, effectiveness, of, the, cleaner, only, how, much, electricity, it, consumes, after, august, 2014, due, to, eu, rules, manufacture, of, vacuum, cleaners, with, a, power, consumption, greater, than, 1600, watts, were, banned, within, the, eu, and, from, 2017, no, vacuum, cleaner, with, a, wattage, greater, than, 900, watts, was, permitted, the, amount, of, input, power, that, is, converted, into, airflow, at, the, end, of, the, cleaning, hose, is, sometimes, stated, and, is, measured, in, airwatts, the, measurement, units, are, simply, watts, the, word, air, is, used, to, clarify, that, this, is, output, power, not, input, electrical, power, the, airwatt, is, derived, from, english, units, astm, international, defines, the, airwatt, as, 0, 117354, f, s, where, f, is, the, rate, of, air, flow, in, ft, 3, min, and, s, is, the, pressure, in, inches, of, water, this, makes, one, airwatt, equal, to, 0, 9983, watts, the, peak, horsepower, of, a, vacuum, cleaner, is, often, measured, by, removal, of, any, cooling, fans, and, calculating, power, based, on, the, motor, s, power, plus, the, rotational, inertial, energy, stored, the, motor, armature, and, centrifugal, blower, a, peak, horsepower, rating, is, often, an, impractical, figure, and, is, only, valid, for, a, very, short, period, continuous, power, is, typically, far, lower, vacuum, cleaners, have, become, closely, associated, with, housecleaning, and, artists, have, sometimes, used, them, to, symbolize, the, banality, and, routine, of, everyday, life, and, culture, visual, artist, jeff, koons, exhibited, his, the, new, series, of, household, vacuums, enshrined, in, museum, quality, vitrines, such, as, new, shelton, wet, dry, doubledecker, 1981, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, and, new, hoover, convertibles, green, blue, new, hoover, convertibles, green, blue, doubledecker, 1981, 1987, at, the, whitney, museum, of, american, art, in, 2002, fashion, designer, tara, subkoff, used, topless, models, wielding, upright, vacuum, cleaners, to, promote, her, controversial, fashion, label, imitation, of, christ, in, 2018, paulius, markevi, ius, organized, performances, of, dance, for, the, vacuum, cleaner, and, father, choreographed, by, greta, grinevi, i, t, and, premiered, in, vilnius, lithuania, in, 2019, sandrina, lindgren, choreographed, dancers, in, requiem, for, vacuum, cleaning, in, the, barker, theatre, of, turku, finland, with, each, performer, operating, multiple, machines, simultaneously, musician, frank, zappa, used, vacuum, cleaners, in, many, of, his, different, performances, and, on, promotional, artwork, other, performers, have, used, a, vacuum, cleaner, hose, or, wand, as, a, modernized, version, of, the, australian, aboriginal, didgeridoo, or, used, the, whine, of, the, motor, for, techno, music, in, 1996, mister, rogers, neighborhood, episode, 1702, featured, vacuum, cleaners, including, dancing, magic, and, a, segment, showing, how, a, small, dirt, devil, canister, vacuum, was, manufactured
