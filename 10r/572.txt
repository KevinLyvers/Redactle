in, navigation, dead, reckoning, is, the, process, of, calculating, the, current, position, of, a, moving, object, by, using, a, previously, determined, position, or, fix, and, incorporating, estimates, of, speed, heading, or, direction, or, course, and, elapsed, time, the, corresponding, term, in, biology, to, describe, the, processes, by, which, animals, update, their, estimates, of, position, or, heading, is, path, integration, advances, in, navigational, aids, that, give, accurate, information, on, position, in, particular, satellite, navigation, using, the, global, positioning, system, have, made, simple, dead, reckoning, by, humans, obsolete, for, most, purposes, however, inertial, navigation, systems, which, provide, very, accurate, directional, information, use, dead, reckoning, and, are, very, widely, applied, contrary, to, myth, the, term, dead, reckoning, was, not, originally, used, to, abbreviate, deduced, reckoning, nor, is, it, a, misspelling, of, the, term, ded, reckoning, the, use, of, ded, or, deduced, reckoning, is, not, known, to, have, appeared, earlier, than, 1931, much, later, in, history, than, dead, reckoning, which, appeared, as, early, as, 1613, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, original, intention, of, dead, in, the, term, is, generally, assumed, to, mean, using, a, stationary, object, that, is, dead, in, the, water, as, a, basis, for, calculations, additionally, at, the, time, the, first, appearance, of, dead, reckoning, ded, was, considered, a, common, spelling, of, dead, this, potentially, led, to, later, confusion, of, the, origin, of, the, term, by, analogy, with, their, navigational, use, the, words, dead, reckoning, are, also, used, to, mean, the, process, of, estimating, the, value, of, any, variable, quantity, by, using, an, earlier, value, and, adding, whatever, changes, have, occurred, in, the, meantime, often, this, usage, implies, that, the, changes, are, not, known, accurately, the, earlier, value, and, the, changes, may, be, measured, or, calculated, quantities, while, dead, reckoning, can, give, the, best, available, information, on, the, present, position, with, little, math, or, analysis, it, is, subject, to, significant, errors, of, approximation, for, precise, positional, information, both, speed, and, direction, must, be, accurately, known, at, all, times, during, travel, most, notably, dead, reckoning, does, not, account, for, directional, drift, during, travel, through, a, fluid, medium, these, errors, tend, to, compound, themselves, over, greater, distances, making, dead, reckoning, a, difficult, method, of, navigation, for, longer, journeys, for, example, if, displacement, is, measured, by, the, number, of, rotations, of, a, wheel, any, discrepancy, between, the, actual, and, assumed, traveled, distance, per, rotation, due, perhaps, to, slippage, or, surface, irregularities, will, be, a, source, of, error, as, each, estimate, of, position, is, relative, to, the, previous, one, errors, are, cumulative, or, compounding, over, time, the, accuracy, of, dead, reckoning, can, be, increased, significantly, by, using, other, more, reliable, methods, to, get, a, new, fix, part, way, through, the, journey, for, example, if, one, was, navigating, on, land, in, poor, visibility, then, dead, reckoning, could, be, used, to, get, close, enough, to, the, known, position, of, a, landmark, to, be, able, to, see, it, before, walking, to, the, landmark, itself, giving, a, precisely, known, starting, point, and, then, setting, off, again, localizing, a, static, sensor, node, is, not, a, difficult, task, because, attaching, a, global, positioning, system, gps, device, suffices, the, need, of, localization, but, a, mobile, sensor, node, which, continuously, changes, its, geographical, location, with, time, is, difficult, to, localize, mostly, mobile, sensor, nodes, within, some, particular, domain, for, data, collection, can, be, used, i, e, sensor, node, attached, to, an, animal, within, a, grazing, field, or, attached, to, a, soldier, on, a, battlefield, within, these, scenarios, a, gps, device, for, each, sensor, node, cannot, be, afforded, some, of, the, reasons, for, this, include, cost, size, and, battery, drainage, of, constrained, sensor, nodes, to, overcome, this, problem, a, limited, number, of, reference, nodes, with, gps, within, a, field, is, employed, these, nodes, continuously, broadcast, their, locations, and, other, nodes, in, proximity, receive, these, locations, and, calculate, their, position, using, some, mathematical, technique, like, trilateration, for, localization, at, least, three, known, reference, locations, are, necessary, to, localize, several, localization, algorithms, based, on, sequential, monte, carlo, smc, method, have, been, proposed, in, literature, sometimes, a, node, at, some, places, receives, only, two, known, locations, and, hence, it, becomes, impossible, to, localize, to, overcome, this, problem, dead, reckoning, technique, is, used, with, this, technique, a, sensor, node, uses, its, previous, calculated, location, for, localization, at, later, time, intervals, for, example, at, time, instant, 1, if, node, a, calculates, its, position, as, loca, 1, with, the, help, of, three, known, reference, locations, then, at, time, instant, 2, it, uses, loca, 1, along, with, two, other, reference, locations, received, from, other, two, reference, nodes, this, not, only, localizes, a, node, in, less, time, but, also, localizes, in, positions, where, it, is, difficult, to, get, three, reference, locations, in, studies, of, animal, navigation, dead, reckoning, is, more, commonly, though, not, exclusively, known, as, path, integration, animals, use, it, to, estimate, their, current, location, based, on, their, movements, from, their, last, known, location, animals, such, as, ants, rodents, and, geese, have, been, shown, to, track, their, locations, continuously, relative, to, a, starting, point, and, to, return, to, it, an, important, skill, for, foragers, with, a, fixed, home, in, marine, navigation, a, dead, reckoning, plot, generally, does, not, take, into, account, the, effect, of, currents, or, wind, aboard, ship, a, dead, reckoning, plot, is, considered, important, in, evaluating, position, information, and, planning, the, movement, of, the, vessel, dead, reckoning, begins, with, a, known, position, or, fix, which, is, then, advanced, mathematically, or, directly, on, the, chart, by, means, of, recorded, heading, speed, and, time, speed, can, be, determined, by, many, methods, before, modern, instrumentation, it, was, determined, aboard, ship, using, a, chip, log, more, modern, methods, include, pit, log, referencing, engine, speed, e, g, in, rpm, against, a, table, of, total, displacement, for, ships, or, referencing, one, s, indicated, airspeed, fed, by, the, pressure, from, a, pitot, tube, this, measurement, is, converted, to, an, equivalent, airspeed, based, upon, known, atmospheric, conditions, and, measured, errors, in, the, indicated, airspeed, system, a, naval, vessel, uses, a, device, called, a, pit, sword, rodmeter, which, uses, two, sensors, on, a, metal, rod, to, measure, the, electromagnetic, variance, caused, by, the, ship, moving, through, water, this, change, is, then, converted, to, ship, s, speed, distance, is, determined, by, multiplying, the, speed, and, the, time, this, initial, position, can, then, be, adjusted, resulting, in, an, estimated, position, by, taking, into, account, the, current, known, as, set, and, drift, in, marine, navigation, if, there, is, no, positional, information, available, a, new, dead, reckoning, plot, may, start, from, an, estimated, position, in, this, case, subsequent, dead, reckoning, positions, will, have, taken, into, account, estimated, set, and, drift, dead, reckoning, positions, are, calculated, at, predetermined, intervals, and, are, maintained, between, fixes, the, duration, of, the, interval, varies, factors, including, one, s, speed, made, good, and, the, nature, of, heading, and, other, course, changes, and, the, navigator, s, judgment, determine, when, dead, reckoning, positions, are, calculated, before, the, 18th, century, development, of, the, marine, chronometer, by, john, harrison, and, the, lunar, distance, method, dead, reckoning, was, the, primary, method, of, determining, longitude, available, to, mariners, such, as, christopher, columbus, and, john, cabot, on, their, trans, atlantic, voyages, tools, such, as, the, traverse, board, were, developed, to, enable, even, illiterate, crew, members, to, collect, the, data, needed, for, dead, reckoning, polynesian, navigation, however, uses, different, wayfinding, techniques, on, 14, june, 1919, john, alcock, and, arthur, brown, took, off, from, lester, s, field, in, st, john, s, newfoundland, in, a, vickers, vimy, they, navigated, across, the, atlantic, ocean, by, dead, reckoning, and, landed, in, county, galway, ireland, at, 8, 40, a, m, on, 15, june, completing, the, first, non, stop, transatlantic, flight, on, 21, may, 1927, charles, lindbergh, landed, in, paris, france, after, a, successful, non, stop, flight, from, the, united, states, in, the, single, engined, spirit, of, st, louis, as, the, aircraft, was, equipped, with, very, basic, instruments, lindbergh, used, dead, reckoning, to, navigate, dead, reckoning, in, the, air, is, similar, to, dead, reckoning, on, the, sea, but, slightly, more, complicated, the, density, of, the, air, the, aircraft, moves, through, affects, its, performance, as, well, as, winds, weight, and, power, settings, the, basic, formula, for, dr, is, distance, speed, x, time, an, aircraft, flying, at, 250, knots, airspeed, for, 2, hours, has, flown, 500, nautical, miles, through, the, air, the, wind, triangle, is, used, to, calculate, the, effects, of, wind, on, heading, and, airspeed, to, obtain, a, magnetic, heading, to, steer, and, the, speed, over, the, ground, groundspeed, printed, tables, formulae, or, an, e6b, flight, computer, are, used, to, calculate, the, effects, of, air, density, on, aircraft, rate, of, climb, rate, of, fuel, burn, and, airspeed, a, course, line, is, drawn, on, the, aeronautical, chart, along, with, estimated, positions, at, fixed, intervals, say, every, half, hour, visual, observations, of, ground, features, are, used, to, obtain, fixes, by, comparing, the, fix, and, the, estimated, position, corrections, are, made, to, the, aircraft, s, heading, and, groundspeed, dead, reckoning, is, on, the, curriculum, for, vfr, visual, flight, rules, or, basic, level, pilots, worldwide, it, is, taught, regardless, of, whether, the, aircraft, has, navigation, aids, such, as, gps, adf, and, vor, and, is, an, icao, requirement, many, flying, training, schools, will, prevent, a, student, from, using, electronic, aids, until, they, have, mastered, dead, reckoning, inertial, navigation, systems, inses, which, are, nearly, universal, on, more, advanced, aircraft, use, dead, reckoning, internally, the, ins, provides, reliable, navigation, capability, under, virtually, any, conditions, without, the, need, for, external, navigation, references, although, it, is, still, prone, to, slight, errors, dead, reckoning, is, today, implemented, in, some, high, end, automotive, navigation, systems, in, order, to, overcome, the, limitations, of, gps, gnss, technology, alone, satellite, microwave, signals, are, unavailable, in, parking, garages, and, tunnels, and, often, severely, degraded, in, urban, canyons, and, near, trees, due, to, blocked, lines, of, sight, to, the, satellites, or, multipath, propagation, in, a, dead, reckoning, navigation, system, the, car, is, equipped, with, sensors, that, know, the, wheel, circumference, and, record, wheel, rotations, and, steering, direction, these, sensors, are, often, already, present, in, cars, for, other, purposes, anti, lock, braking, system, electronic, stability, control, and, can, be, read, by, the, navigation, system, from, the, controller, area, network, bus, the, navigation, system, then, uses, a, kalman, filter, to, integrate, the, always, available, sensor, data, with, the, accurate, but, occasionally, unavailable, position, information, from, the, satellite, data, into, a, combined, position, fix, dead, reckoning, is, utilized, in, some, robotic, applications, it, is, usually, used, to, reduce, the, need, for, sensing, technology, such, as, ultrasonic, sensors, gps, or, placement, of, some, linear, and, rotary, encoders, in, an, autonomous, robot, thus, greatly, reducing, cost, and, complexity, at, the, expense, of, performance, and, repeatability, the, proper, utilization, of, dead, reckoning, in, this, sense, would, be, to, supply, a, known, percentage, of, electrical, power, or, hydraulic, pressure, to, the, robot, s, drive, motors, over, a, given, amount, of, time, from, a, general, starting, point, dead, reckoning, is, not, totally, accurate, which, can, lead, to, errors, in, distance, estimates, ranging, from, a, few, millimeters, in, cnc, machining, to, kilometers, in, uavs, based, upon, the, duration, of, the, run, the, speed, of, the, robot, the, length, of, the, run, and, several, other, factors, with, the, increased, sensor, offering, in, smartphones, built, in, accelerometers, can, be, used, as, a, pedometer, and, built, in, magnetometer, as, a, compass, heading, provider, pedestrian, dead, reckoning, pdr, can, be, used, to, supplement, other, navigation, methods, in, a, similar, way, to, automotive, navigation, or, to, extend, navigation, into, areas, where, other, navigation, systems, are, unavailable, in, a, simple, implementation, the, user, holds, their, phone, in, front, of, them, and, each, step, causes, position, to, move, forward, a, fixed, distance, in, the, direction, measured, by, the, compass, accuracy, is, limited, by, the, sensor, precision, magnetic, disturbances, inside, structures, and, unknown, variables, such, as, carrying, position, and, stride, length, another, challenge, is, differentiating, walking, from, running, and, recognizing, movements, like, bicycling, climbing, stairs, or, riding, an, elevator, before, phone, based, systems, existed, many, custom, pdr, systems, existed, while, a, pedometer, can, only, be, used, to, measure, linear, distance, traveled, pdr, systems, have, an, embedded, magnetometer, for, heading, measurement, custom, pdr, systems, can, take, many, forms, including, special, boots, belts, and, watches, where, the, variability, of, carrying, position, has, been, minimized, to, better, utilize, magnetometer, heading, true, dead, reckoning, is, fairly, complicated, as, it, is, not, only, important, to, minimize, basic, drift, but, also, to, handle, different, carrying, scenarios, and, movements, as, well, as, hardware, differences, across, phone, models, the, south, pointing, chariot, was, an, ancient, chinese, device, consisting, of, a, two, wheeled, horse, drawn, vehicle, which, carried, a, pointer, that, was, intended, always, to, aim, to, the, south, no, matter, how, the, chariot, turned, the, chariot, pre, dated, the, navigational, use, of, the, magnetic, compass, and, could, not, detect, the, direction, that, was, south, instead, it, used, a, kind, of, directional, dead, reckoning, at, the, start, of, a, journey, the, pointer, was, aimed, southward, by, hand, using, local, knowledge, or, astronomical, observations, e, g, of, the, pole, star, then, as, it, traveled, a, mechanism, possibly, containing, differential, gears, used, the, different, rotational, speeds, of, the, two, wheels, to, turn, the, pointer, relative, to, the, body, of, the, chariot, by, the, angle, of, turns, made, subject, to, available, mechanical, accuracy, keeping, the, pointer, aiming, in, its, original, direction, to, the, south, errors, as, always, with, dead, reckoning, would, accumulate, as, distance, traveled, increased, networked, games, and, simulation, tools, routinely, use, dead, reckoning, to, predict, where, an, actor, should, be, right, now, using, its, last, known, kinematic, state, position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, and, angular, velocity, this, is, primarily, needed, because, it, is, impractical, to, send, network, updates, at, the, rate, that, most, games, run, 60, hz, the, basic, solution, starts, by, projecting, into, the, future, using, linear, physics, p, t, p, 0, v, 0, t, 1, 2, a, 0, t, 2, displaystyle, p, t, p, 0, v, 0, t, frac, 1, 2, a, 0, t, 2, this, formula, is, used, to, move, the, object, until, a, new, update, is, received, over, the, network, at, that, point, the, problem, is, that, there, are, now, two, kinematic, states, the, currently, estimated, position, and, the, just, received, actual, position, resolving, these, two, states, in, a, believable, way, can, be, quite, complex, one, approach, is, to, create, a, curve, e, g, cubic, b, zier, splines, centripetal, catmull, rom, splines, and, hermite, curves, between, the, two, states, while, still, projecting, into, the, future, another, technique, is, to, use, projective, velocity, blending, which, is, the, blending, of, two, projections, last, known, and, current, where, the, current, projection, uses, a, blending, between, the, last, known, and, current, velocity, over, a, set, time, the, first, equation, calculates, a, blended, velocity, v, b, displaystyle, v, b, given, the, client, side, velocity, at, the, time, of, the, last, server, update, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, and, the, last, known, server, side, velocity, v, 0, displaystyle, acute, v, 0, this, essentially, blends, from, the, client, side, velocity, towards, the, server, side, velocity, for, a, smooth, transition, note, that, t, displaystyle, hat, t, should, go, from, zero, at, the, time, of, the, server, update, to, one, at, the, time, at, which, the, next, update, should, be, arriving, a, late, server, update, is, unproblematic, as, long, as, t, displaystyle, hat, t, remains, at, one, next, two, positions, are, calculated, firstly, the, blended, velocity, v, b, displaystyle, v, b, and, the, last, known, server, side, acceleration, a, 0, displaystyle, acute, a, 0, are, used, to, calculate, p, t, displaystyle, p, t, this, is, a, position, which, is, projected, from, the, client, side, start, position, p, 0, displaystyle, p, 0, based, on, t, t, displaystyle, t, t, the, time, which, has, passed, since, the, last, server, update, secondly, the, same, equation, is, used, with, the, last, known, server, side, parameters, to, calculate, the, position, projected, from, the, last, known, server, side, position, p, 0, displaystyle, acute, p, 0, and, velocity, v, 0, displaystyle, acute, v, 0, resulting, in, p, t, displaystyle, acute, p, t, finally, the, new, position, to, display, on, the, client, p, o, s, displaystyle, pos, is, the, result, of, interpolating, from, the, projected, position, based, on, client, information, p, t, displaystyle, p, t, towards, the, projected, position, based, on, the, last, known, server, information, p, t, displaystyle, acute, p, t, the, resulting, movement, smoothly, resolves, the, discrepancy, between, client, side, and, server, side, information, even, if, this, server, side, information, arrives, infrequently, or, inconsistently, it, is, also, free, of, oscillations, which, spline, based, interpolation, may, suffer, from, in, computer, science, dead, reckoning, refers, to, navigating, an, array, data, structure, using, indexes, since, every, array, element, has, the, same, size, it, is, possible, to, directly, access, one, array, element, by, knowing, any, position, in, the, array, given, the, following, array, knowing, the, memory, address, where, the, array, starts, it, is, easy, to, compute, the, memory, address, of, d, address, d, address, start, of, array, size, array, element, arrayindex, d, displaystyle, text, address, text, d, text, address, text, start, of, array, text, size, text, array, element, text, arrayindex, text, d, likewise, knowing, d, s, memory, address, it, is, easy, to, compute, the, memory, address, of, b, address, b, address, d, size, array, element, arrayindex, d, arrayindex, b, displaystyle, text, address, text, b, text, address, text, d, text, size, text, array, element, text, arrayindex, text, d, text, arrayindex, text, b, this, property, is, particularly, important, for, performance, when, used, in, conjunction, with, arrays, of, structures, because, data, can, be, directly, accessed, without, going, through, a, pointer, dereference, transport, portal
