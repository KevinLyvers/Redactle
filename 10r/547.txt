a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, wmd, is, a, biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, or, any, other, weapon, that, can, kill, or, significantly, harm, many, people, or, cause, great, damage, to, artificial, structures, e, g, buildings, natural, structures, e, g, mountains, or, the, biosphere, the, scope, and, usage, of, the, term, has, evolved, and, been, disputed, often, signifying, more, politically, than, technically, originally, coined, in, reference, to, aerial, bombing, with, chemical, explosives, during, world, war, ii, it, has, later, come, to, refer, to, large, scale, weaponry, of, warfare, related, technologies, such, as, biological, chemical, radiological, or, nuclear, warfare, the, first, use, of, the, term, weapon, of, mass, destruction, on, record, is, by, cosmo, gordon, lang, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, 1937, in, reference, to, the, aerial, bombing, of, guernica, spain, who, can, think, at, this, present, time, without, a, sickening, of, the, heart, of, the, appalling, slaughter, the, suffering, the, manifold, misery, brought, by, war, to, spain, and, to, china, who, can, think, without, horror, of, what, another, widespread, war, would, mean, waged, as, it, would, be, with, all, the, new, weapons, of, mass, destruction, at, the, time, nuclear, weapons, had, not, been, developed, japan, conducted, research, on, biological, weapons, see, unit, 731, and, chemical, weapons, had, seen, wide, battlefield, use, in, world, war, i, their, use, was, outlawed, by, the, geneva, protocol, of, 1925, italy, used, mustard, agent, against, civilians, and, soldiers, in, ethiopia, in, 1935, 36, following, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, that, ended, world, war, ii, and, during, the, cold, war, the, term, came, to, refer, more, to, non, conventional, weapons, the, application, of, the, term, to, specifically, nuclear, and, radiological, weapons, is, traced, by, william, safire, to, the, russian, phrase, oruzhiye, massovogo, porazheniya, weapon, of, mass, destruction, william, safire, credits, james, goodby, of, the, brookings, institution, with, tracing, what, he, considers, the, earliest, known, english, language, use, soon, after, the, nuclear, bombing, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, although, it, is, not, quite, verbatim, a, communique, from, a, 15, november, 1945, meeting, of, harry, truman, clement, attlee, and, mackenzie, king, probably, drafted, by, vannevar, bush, as, bush, claimed, in, 1970, referred, to, weapons, adaptable, to, mass, destruction, safire, says, bernard, baruch, used, that, exact, phrase, in, 1946, in, a, speech, at, the, united, nations, probably, written, by, herbert, bayard, swope, the, phrase, found, its, way, into, the, very, first, resolution, the, united, nations, general, assembly, adopted, in, january, 1946, in, london, which, used, the, wording, the, elimination, from, national, armaments, of, atomic, weapons, and, of, all, other, weapons, adaptable, to, mass, destruction, the, resolution, also, created, the, atomic, energy, commission, predecessor, of, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, iaea, an, exact, use, of, this, term, was, given, in, a, lecture, titled, atomic, energy, as, a, contemporary, problem, by, j, robert, oppenheimer, he, delivered, the, lecture, to, the, foreign, service, and, the, state, department, on, 17, september, 1947, it, is, a, very, far, reaching, control, which, would, eliminate, the, rivalry, between, nations, in, this, field, which, would, prevent, the, surreptitious, arming, of, one, nation, against, another, which, would, provide, some, cushion, of, time, before, atomic, attack, and, presumably, therefore, before, any, attack, with, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, which, would, go, a, long, way, toward, removing, atomic, energy, at, least, as, a, source, of, conflict, between, the, powers, the, term, was, also, used, in, the, introduction, to, the, hugely, influential, u, s, government, document, known, as, nsc, 68, written, in, 1950, during, a, speech, at, rice, university, on, 12, september, 1962, president, john, f, kennedy, spoke, of, not, filling, space, with, weapons, of, mass, destruction, but, with, instruments, of, knowledge, and, understanding, the, following, month, during, a, televised, presentation, about, the, cuban, missile, crisis, on, 22, october, 1962, kennedy, made, reference, to, offensive, weapons, of, sudden, mass, destruction, an, early, use, of, the, exact, phrase, in, an, international, treaty, is, in, the, outer, space, treaty, of, 1967, but, the, treaty, provides, no, definition, of, the, phrase, and, the, treaty, also, categorically, prohibits, the, stationing, of, weapons, and, the, testing, of, any, type, of, weapon, in, outer, space, in, addition, to, its, specific, prohibition, against, placing, in, orbit, or, installing, on, celestial, bodies, any, objects, carrying, nuclear, weapons, or, any, other, kinds, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, during, the, cold, war, the, term, weapons, of, mass, destruction, was, primarily, a, reference, to, nuclear, weapons, at, the, time, in, the, west, the, euphemism, strategic, weapons, was, used, to, refer, to, the, american, nuclear, arsenal, however, there, is, no, precise, definition, of, the, strategic, category, neither, considering, range, nor, yield, of, the, nuclear, weapon, subsequent, to, operation, opera, the, destruction, of, a, pre, operational, nuclear, reactor, inside, iraq, by, the, israeli, air, force, in, 1981, the, israeli, prime, minister, menachem, begin, countered, criticism, by, saying, that, on, no, account, shall, we, permit, an, enemy, to, develop, weapons, of, mass, destruction, against, the, people, of, israel, this, policy, of, pre, emptive, action, against, real, or, perceived, weapons, of, mass, destruction, became, known, as, the, begin, doctrine, the, term, weapons, of, mass, destruction, continued, to, see, periodic, use, usually, in, the, context, of, nuclear, arms, control, ronald, reagan, used, it, during, the, 1986, reykjav, k, summit, when, referring, to, the, 1967, outer, space, treaty, reagan, s, successor, george, h, w, bush, used, the, term, in, a, 1989, speech, to, the, united, nations, primarily, in, reference, to, chemical, arms, the, end, of, the, cold, war, reduced, u, s, reliance, on, nuclear, weapons, as, a, deterrent, causing, it, to, shift, its, focus, to, disarmament, with, the, 1990, invasion, of, kuwait, and, 1991, gulf, war, iraq, s, nuclear, biological, and, chemical, weapons, programs, became, a, particular, concern, of, the, first, bush, administration, following, the, war, bill, clinton, and, other, western, politicians, and, media, continued, to, use, the, term, usually, in, reference, to, ongoing, attempts, to, dismantle, iraq, s, weapons, programs, after, the, 11, september, 2001, attacks, and, the, 2001, anthrax, attacks, in, the, united, states, an, increased, fear, of, nonconventional, weapons, and, asymmetric, warfare, took, hold, in, many, countries, the, fear, reached, a, crescendo, with, the, 2002, iraq, disarmament, crisis, and, the, alleged, existence, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, in, iraq, that, became, the, primary, justification, for, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, however, american, forces, found, none, in, iraq, they, found, old, stockpiles, of, chemical, munitions, including, sarin, and, mustard, agents, but, all, were, considered, to, be, unusable, because, of, corrosion, or, degradation, iraq, however, declared, a, chemical, weapons, stockpile, in, 2009, which, u, n, personnel, had, secured, after, the, 1991, gulf, war, the, stockpile, contained, mainly, chemical, precursors, but, some, munitions, remained, usable, because, of, its, prolific, use, and, worldwide, public, profile, during, this, period, the, american, dialect, society, voted, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, its, abbreviation, wmd, the, word, of, the, year, in, 2002, and, in, 2003, lake, superior, state, university, added, wmd, to, its, list, of, terms, banished, for, mis, use, over, use, and, general, uselessness, and, as, a, card, that, trumps, all, forms, of, aggression, in, its, criminal, complaint, against, the, main, suspect, of, the, boston, marathon, bombing, of, 15, april, 2013, the, fbi, refers, to, a, pressure, cooker, improvised, bomb, as, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, there, have, been, calls, to, classify, at, least, some, classes, of, cyber, weapons, as, wmd, in, particular, those, aimed, to, bring, about, large, scale, physical, destruction, such, as, by, targeting, critical, infrastructure, however, some, scholars, have, objected, to, classifying, cyber, weapons, as, wmd, on, the, grounds, that, they, cannot, directly, injure, or, kill, human, beings, as, efficiently, as, guns, or, bombs, or, clearly, meet, the, legal, and, historical, definitions, of, wmd, the, most, widely, used, definition, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, is, that, of, nuclear, biological, or, chemical, weapons, nbc, although, there, is, no, treaty, or, customary, international, law, that, contains, an, authoritative, definition, instead, international, law, has, been, used, with, respect, to, the, specific, categories, of, weapons, within, wmd, and, not, to, wmd, as, a, whole, while, nuclear, chemical, and, biological, weapons, are, regarded, as, the, three, major, types, of, wmds, some, analysts, have, argued, that, radiological, materials, as, well, as, missile, technology, and, delivery, systems, such, as, aircraft, and, ballistic, missiles, could, be, labeled, as, wmds, as, well, however, there, is, an, argument, that, nuclear, and, biological, weapons, do, not, belong, in, the, same, category, as, chemical, and, dirty, bomb, radiological, weapons, which, have, limited, destructive, potential, and, close, to, none, as, far, as, property, is, concerned, whereas, nuclear, and, biological, weapons, have, the, unique, ability, to, kill, large, numbers, of, people, with, very, small, amounts, of, material, and, thus, could, be, said, to, belong, in, a, class, by, themselves, the, nbc, definition, has, also, been, used, in, official, u, s, documents, by, the, u, s, president, the, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, the, u, s, department, of, defense, and, the, u, s, government, accountability, office, other, documents, expand, the, definition, of, wmd, to, also, include, radiological, or, conventional, weapons, the, u, s, military, refers, to, wmd, as, chemical, biological, radiological, or, nuclear, weapons, capable, of, a, high, order, of, destruction, or, causing, mass, casualties, and, exclude, the, means, of, transporting, or, propelling, the, weapon, where, such, means, is, a, separable, and, divisible, part, from, the, weapon, also, called, wmd, this, may, also, refer, to, nuclear, icbms, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, the, significance, of, the, words, separable, and, divisible, part, of, the, weapon, is, that, missiles, such, as, the, pershing, ii, and, the, scud, are, considered, weapons, of, mass, destruction, while, aircraft, capable, of, carrying, bombloads, are, not, in, 2004, the, united, kingdom, s, butler, review, recognized, the, considerable, and, long, standing, academic, debate, about, the, proper, interpretation, of, the, phrase, weapons, of, mass, destruction, the, committee, set, out, to, avoid, the, general, term, but, when, using, it, employed, the, definition, of, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 687, which, defined, the, systems, which, iraq, was, required, to, abandon, chemical, weapons, expert, gert, g, harigel, considers, only, nuclear, weapons, true, weapons, of, mass, destruction, because, only, nuclear, weapons, are, completely, indiscriminate, by, their, explosive, power, heat, radiation, and, radioactivity, and, only, they, should, therefore, be, called, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, he, prefers, to, call, chemical, and, biological, weapons, weapons, of, terror, when, aimed, against, civilians, and, weapons, of, intimidation, for, soldiers, testimony, of, one, such, soldier, expresses, the, same, viewpoint, for, a, period, of, several, months, in, the, winter, of, 2002, 2003, u, s, deputy, secretary, of, defense, paul, wolfowitz, frequently, used, the, term, weapons, of, mass, terror, apparently, also, recognizing, the, distinction, between, the, psychological, and, the, physical, effects, of, many, things, currently, falling, into, the, wmd, category, gustavo, bell, lemus, the, vice, president, of, colombia, at, 9, july, 2001, united, nations, conference, on, the, illicit, trade, in, small, arms, and, light, weapons, in, all, its, aspects, quoted, the, millennium, report, of, the, un, secretary, general, to, the, general, assembly, in, which, kofi, annan, said, that, small, arms, could, be, described, as, wmd, because, the, fatalities, they, cause, dwarf, that, of, all, other, weapons, systems, and, in, most, years, greatly, exceed, the, toll, of, the, atomic, bombs, that, devastated, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, an, additional, condition, often, implicitly, applied, to, wmd, is, that, the, use, of, the, weapons, must, be, strategic, in, other, words, they, would, be, designed, to, have, consequences, far, outweighing, the, size, and, effectiveness, of, the, weapons, themselves, the, strategic, nature, of, wmd, also, defines, their, function, in, the, military, doctrine, of, total, war, as, targeting, the, means, a, country, would, use, to, support, and, supply, its, war, effort, specifically, its, population, industry, and, natural, resources, within, u, s, civil, defense, organizations, the, category, is, now, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and, explosive, cbrne, which, defines, wmd, as, 1, any, explosive, incendiary, poison, gas, bomb, grenade, or, rocket, having, a, propellant, charge, of, more, than, four, ounces, missile, having, an, explosive, or, incendiary, charge, of, more, than, one, quarter, ounce, or, mine, or, device, similar, to, the, above, 2, poison, gas, 3, any, weapon, involving, a, disease, organism, 4, any, weapon, that, is, designed, to, release, radiation, at, a, level, dangerous, to, human, life, for, the, general, purposes, of, national, defense, the, u, s, code, defines, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, as, for, the, purposes, of, the, prevention, of, weapons, proliferation, the, u, s, code, defines, weapons, of, mass, destruction, as, chemical, biological, and, nuclear, weapons, and, chemical, biological, and, nuclear, materials, used, in, the, manufacture, of, such, weapons, for, the, purposes, of, u, s, criminal, law, concerning, terrorism, weapons, of, mass, destruction, are, defined, as, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, s, definition, is, similar, to, that, presented, above, from, the, terrorism, statute, indictments, and, convictions, for, possession, and, use, of, wmd, such, as, truck, bombs, pipe, bombs, shoe, bombs, and, cactus, needles, coated, with, a, biological, toxin, have, been, obtained, under, 18, usc, 2332a, as, defined, by, 18, usc, 2332, a, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, is, under, the, same, statute, conspiring, attempting, threatening, or, using, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, may, be, imprisoned, for, any, term, of, years, or, for, life, and, if, resulting, in, death, be, punishable, by, death, or, by, imprisonment, for, any, terms, of, years, or, for, life, they, can, also, be, asked, to, pay, a, maximum, fine, of, 250, 000, the, washington, post, reported, on, 30, march, 2006, jurors, asked, the, judge, in, the, death, penalty, trial, of, zacarias, moussaoui, today, to, define, the, term, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, were, told, it, includes, airplanes, used, as, missiles, moussaoui, was, indicted, and, tried, for, conspiracy, to, both, destroy, aircraft, and, use, weapons, of, mass, destruction, among, others, the, surviving, boston, marathon, bombing, perpetrator, dzhokhar, tsarnaev, was, charged, in, june, 2013, with, the, federal, offense, of, use, of, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, after, he, and, his, brother, tamerlan, tsarnaev, allegedly, placed, crude, shrapnel, bombs, made, from, pressure, cookers, packed, with, ball, bearings, and, nails, near, the, finish, line, of, the, boston, marathon, he, was, convicted, in, april, 2015, the, bombing, resulted, in, three, deaths, and, at, least, 264, injuries, the, development, and, use, of, wmd, is, governed, by, several, international, conventions, and, treaties, nuclear, weapons, use, the, energy, inside, of, an, atom, s, nucleus, to, create, massive, explosions, this, goal, is, achieved, through, nuclear, fission, and, fusion, nuclear, fission, is, when, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, is, split, into, smaller, nuclei, this, process, can, be, induced, by, shooting, a, neutron, at, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, when, the, neutron, is, absorbed, by, the, atom, it, becomes, unstable, causing, it, to, split, and, release, energy, modern, nuclear, weapons, start, this, process, by, detonating, chemical, explosives, around, a, pit, of, either, uranium, 235, or, plutonium, 239, metal, the, force, from, this, detonation, is, directed, inwards, causing, the, pit, of, uranium, or, plutonium, to, compress, to, a, dense, point, once, the, uranium, plutonium, is, dense, enough, neutrons, are, then, injected, this, starts, a, fission, chain, reaction, also, known, as, an, atomic, explosion, nuclear, fusion, is, essentially, the, opposite, of, fission, it, is, the, fusing, together, of, nuclei, not, the, splitting, of, it, when, exposed, to, extreme, pressure, and, temperature, some, lightweight, nuclei, can, fuse, together, and, form, heavier, nuclei, releasing, energy, in, the, process, interestingly, fusion, weapons, also, known, as, thermonuclear, or, hydrogen, weapons, use, the, fission, process, to, initiate, fusion, fusion, weapons, use, the, energy, released, from, a, fission, explosion, to, fuse, hydrogen, isotopes, together, the, energy, released, from, these, weapons, creates, a, fireball, which, reaches, tens, of, million, degrees, a, temperature, of, this, magnitude, is, similar, to, the, temperature, found, at, center, of, the, sun, so, it, shouldn, t, be, any, surprise, to, learn, that, the, sun, runs, on, fusion, as, well, the, only, country, to, have, used, a, nuclear, weapon, in, war, is, the, united, states, which, dropped, two, atomic, bombs, on, the, japanese, cities, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, during, world, war, ii, at, the, start, of, 2023, nine, states, the, united, states, russia, the, united, kingdom, france, china, india, pakistan, the, democratic, people, s, republic, of, korea, dprk, or, north, korea, and, israel, together, possessed, approximately, 12, 512, nuclear, weapons, of, which, 9576, were, considered, to, be, potentially, operationally, available, an, estimated, 3844, of, these, warheads, were, deployed, with, operational, forces, including, about, 2000, that, were, kept, in, a, state, of, high, operational, alert, the, same, number, as, the, previous, year, south, africa, developed, a, small, nuclear, arsenal, in, the, 1980s, but, disassembled, them, in, the, early, 1990s, making, it, the, only, country, to, have, fully, given, up, an, independently, developed, nuclear, weapons, arsenal, belarus, kazakhstan, and, ukraine, inherited, stockpiles, of, nuclear, arms, following, the, break, up, of, the, soviet, union, but, relinquished, them, to, the, russian, federation, countries, where, nuclear, weapons, are, deployed, through, nuclear, sharing, agreements, include, belgium, germany, italy, the, netherlands, and, turkey, the, history, of, biological, warfare, goes, back, at, least, to, the, mongol, siege, of, caffa, in, 1346, and, possibly, much, farther, back, to, antiquity, it, is, believed, that, the, ancient, greeks, contaminated, their, adversaries, wells, by, placing, animal, corpses, in, them, however, only, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, did, advances, in, microbiology, allow, for, the, large, scale, weaponization, of, pathogens, during, first, world, war, german, military, attempted, to, introduce, anthrax, into, allied, livestock, in, second, world, war, japan, conducted, aerial, attacks, on, china, using, fleas, carrying, the, bubonic, plague, during, the, 20th, century, at, least, nine, states, have, operated, offensive, biological, weapons, programs, including, canada, 1946, 1956, france, 1921, 1972, iraq, 1985, 1990s, japan, 1930s, 1945, rhodesia, south, africa, 1981, 1993, the, soviet, union, 1920s, 1992, the, united, kingdom, 1934, 1956, and, the, united, states, 1943, 1969, the, japanese, biological, weapons, program, which, was, run, by, the, secret, imperial, japanese, army, unit, 731, during, the, sino, japanese, war, 1937, 1945, became, infamous, for, conducting, often, fatal, human, experiments, on, prisoners, and, producing, biological, weapons, for, combat, use, the, soviet, union, covertly, operated, the, world, s, largest, longest, and, most, sophisticated, biological, weapons, program, in, violation, of, its, obligations, under, international, law, international, restrictions, on, biological, warfare, began, with, the, 1925, geneva, protocol, which, prohibits, the, use, but, not, the, possession, or, development, of, biological, and, chemical, weapons, upon, ratification, of, the, geneva, protocol, several, countries, made, reservations, regarding, its, applicability, and, use, in, retaliation, due, to, these, reservations, it, was, in, practice, a, no, first, use, agreement, only, the, 1972, biological, weapons, convention, bwc, supplements, the, geneva, protocol, by, prohibiting, the, development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling, and, use, of, biological, weapons, having, entered, into, force, on, 26, march, 1975, the, bwc, was, the, first, multilateral, disarmament, treaty, to, ban, the, production, of, an, entire, category, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, as, of, march, 2021, 183, states, have, become, party, to, the, treaty, chemical, weapons, have, been, used, around, the, world, by, various, civilizations, since, ancient, times, the, oldest, reported, case, of, a, chemical, substance, being, used, as, a, weapon, was, in, 256, ad, during, the, siege, of, dura, europos, a, mixture, of, tar, and, sulfur, was, used, to, produce, sulfur, oxides, which, helped, take, control, of, the, city, in, the, industrial, era, chemical, weapons, were, used, extensively, by, both, sides, during, world, war, i, and, by, the, axis, powers, during, world, war, ii, both, in, battle, and, in, extermination, camp, gas, chambers, though, allied, powers, also, stockpiled, them, international, restrictions, on, chemical, warfare, began, with, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, and, was, expanded, significantly, by, the, 1925, geneva, protocol, these, treaties, prohibited, the, use, of, poisons, or, chemical, agents, in, international, warfare, but, did, not, place, restrictions, on, development, or, weapon, stockpiles, since, 1997, the, chemical, weapons, convention, cwc, has, expanded, restrictions, to, prohibit, any, use, and, development, of, chemical, weapons, except, for, very, limited, purposes, research, medical, pharmaceutical, or, protective, as, of, 2018, a, handful, of, countries, have, known, inventories, and, many, are, in, the, process, of, being, safely, destroyed, nonetheless, proliferation, and, use, in, war, zones, remains, an, active, concern, most, recently, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, in, the, syrian, civil, war, some, commentators, classify, some, or, all, the, uses, of, nuclear, chemical, or, biological, weapons, during, wartime, as, a, war, crime, or, crime, against, humanity, if, widespread, because, they, kill, civilians, who, are, protected, by, the, laws, of, war, indiscriminately, or, are, specifically, prohibited, by, international, treaties, which, have, become, more, comprehensive, over, time, proponents, of, use, say, that, specific, uses, of, such, weapons, have, been, necessary, for, defense, or, to, avoid, more, deaths, in, a, protracted, war, the, tactic, of, terror, bombing, from, aircraft, and, generally, targeting, cities, with, area, bombardment, or, saturation, carpet, bombing, has, also, been, criticized, defended, and, prohibited, by, treaty, in, the, same, way, the, destructive, effect, of, conventional, saturation, bombing, is, similar, to, that, of, a, nuclear, weapon, due, to, the, potentially, indiscriminate, effects, of, wmd, the, fear, of, a, wmd, attack, has, shaped, political, policies, and, campaigns, fostered, social, movements, and, has, been, the, central, theme, of, many, films, support, for, different, levels, of, wmd, development, and, control, varies, nationally, and, internationally, yet, understanding, of, the, nature, of, the, threats, is, not, high, in, part, because, of, imprecise, usage, of, the, term, by, politicians, and, the, media, fear, of, wmd, or, of, threats, diminished, by, the, possession, of, wmd, has, long, been, used, to, catalyze, public, support, for, various, wmd, policies, they, include, mobilization, of, pro, and, anti, wmd, campaigners, alike, and, generation, of, popular, political, support, the, term, wmd, may, be, used, as, a, powerful, buzzword, or, to, generate, a, culture, of, fear, it, is, also, used, ambiguously, particularly, by, not, distinguishing, among, the, different, types, of, wmd, a, television, commercial, called, daisy, promoting, democrat, lyndon, johnson, s, 1964, presidential, candidacy, invoked, the, fear, of, a, nuclear, war, and, was, an, element, in, johnson, s, subsequent, election, later, united, states, president, george, w, bush, used, the, threat, of, potential, wmd, in, iraq, as, justification, for, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, broad, reference, to, iraqi, wmd, in, general, was, seen, as, an, element, of, president, bush, s, arguments, the, claim, that, iraq, possessed, weapons, of, mass, destruction, wmd, was, a, major, factor, that, led, to, the, invasion, of, iraq, in, 2003, by, coalition, forces, over, 500, munitions, containing, mustard, agent, and, sarin, were, discovered, throughout, iraq, since, 2003, they, were, made, in, the, 1980s, and, are, no, longer, usable, as, originally, intended, due, to, corrosion, the, american, heritage, dictionary, defines, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, as, a, weapon, that, can, cause, widespread, destruction, or, kill, large, numbers, of, people, especially, a, nuclear, chemical, or, biological, weapon, in, other, words, it, does, not, have, to, be, nuclear, biological, or, chemical, nbc, for, example, dzhokhar, tsarnaev, one, of, the, perpetrators, of, the, boston, marathon, bombing, was, charged, under, united, states, law, 18, u, s, c, 2332a, for, using, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, and, that, was, a, pressure, cooker, bomb, in, other, words, it, was, a, weapon, that, caused, large, scale, death, and, destruction, without, being, an, nbc, weapon, in, march, 2004, the, center, for, international, and, security, studies, at, maryland, cissm, released, a, report, examining, the, media, s, coverage, of, wmd, issues, during, three, separate, periods, nuclear, weapons, tests, by, india, and, pakistan, in, may, 1998, the, u, s, announcement, of, evidence, of, a, north, korean, nuclear, weapons, program, in, october, 2002, and, revelations, about, iran, s, nuclear, program, in, may, 2003, the, cissm, report, argues, that, poor, coverage, resulted, less, from, political, bias, among, the, media, than, from, tired, journalistic, conventions, the, report, s, major, findings, were, that, 1, most, media, outlets, represented, wmd, as, a, monolithic, menace, failing, to, adequately, distinguish, between, weapons, programs, and, actual, weapons, or, to, address, the, real, differences, among, chemical, biological, nuclear, and, radiological, weapons, 2, most, journalists, accepted, the, bush, administration, s, formulation, of, the, war, on, terror, as, a, campaign, against, wmd, in, contrast, to, coverage, during, the, clinton, era, when, many, journalists, made, careful, distinctions, between, acts, of, terrorism, and, the, acquisition, and, use, of, wmd, 3, many, stories, stenographically, reported, the, incumbent, administration, s, perspective, on, wmd, giving, too, little, critical, examination, of, the, way, officials, framed, the, events, issues, threats, and, policy, options, 4, too, few, stories, proffered, alternative, perspectives, to, official, line, a, problem, exacerbated, by, the, journalistic, prioritizing, of, breaking, news, stories, and, the, inverted, pyramid, style, of, storytelling, in, a, separate, study, published, in, 2005, a, group, of, researchers, assessed, the, effects, reports, and, retractions, in, the, media, had, on, people, s, memory, regarding, the, search, for, wmd, in, iraq, during, the, 2003, iraq, war, the, study, focused, on, populations, in, two, coalition, countries, australia, and, the, united, states, and, one, opposed, to, the, war, germany, results, showed, that, u, s, citizens, generally, did, not, correct, initial, misconceptions, regarding, wmd, even, following, disconfirmation, australian, and, german, citizens, were, more, responsive, to, retractions, dependence, on, the, initial, source, of, information, led, to, a, substantial, minority, of, americans, exhibiting, false, memory, that, wmd, were, indeed, discovered, while, they, were, not, this, led, to, three, conclusions, a, poll, conducted, between, june, and, september, 2003, asked, people, whether, they, thought, evidence, of, wmd, had, been, discovered, in, iraq, since, the, war, ended, they, were, also, asked, which, media, sources, they, relied, upon, those, who, obtained, their, news, primarily, from, fox, news, were, three, times, as, likely, to, believe, that, evidence, of, wmd, had, been, discovered, in, iraq, than, those, who, relied, on, pbs, and, npr, for, their, news, and, one, third, more, likely, than, those, who, primarily, watched, cbs, based, on, a, series, of, polls, taken, from, june, september, 2003, in, 2006, fox, news, reported, the, claims, of, two, republican, lawmakers, that, wmds, had, been, found, in, iraq, based, upon, unclassified, portions, of, a, report, by, the, national, ground, intelligence, center, quoting, from, the, report, senator, rick, santorum, said, since, 2003, coalition, forces, have, recovered, approximately, 500, weapons, munitions, which, contain, degraded, mustard, or, sarin, nerve, agent, according, to, david, kay, who, appeared, before, the, u, s, house, armed, services, committee, to, discuss, these, badly, corroded, munitions, they, were, leftovers, many, years, old, improperly, stored, or, destroyed, by, the, iraqis, charles, duelfer, agreed, stating, on, npr, s, talk, of, the, nation, when, i, was, running, the, isg, the, iraq, survey, group, we, had, a, couple, of, them, that, had, been, turned, in, to, these, ieds, the, improvised, explosive, devices, but, they, are, local, hazards, they, are, not, a, major, you, know, weapon, of, mass, destruction, later, wikileaks, would, show, that, wmds, of, these, kinds, continued, to, be, found, as, the, iraqi, occupation, continued, many, news, agencies, including, fox, news, reported, the, conclusions, of, the, cia, that, based, upon, the, investigation, of, the, iraq, survey, group, wmds, are, yet, to, be, found, in, iraq, awareness, and, opinions, of, wmd, have, varied, during, the, course, of, their, history, their, threat, is, a, source, of, unease, security, and, pride, to, different, people, the, anti, wmd, movement, is, embodied, most, in, nuclear, disarmament, and, led, to, the, formation, of, the, british, campaign, for, nuclear, disarmament, in, 1957, in, order, to, increase, awareness, of, all, kinds, of, wmd, in, 2004, the, nuclear, physicist, and, nobel, peace, prize, winner, joseph, rotblat, inspired, the, creation, of, the, wmd, awareness, programme, to, provide, trustworthy, and, up, to, date, information, on, wmd, worldwide, in, 1998, the, university, of, new, mexico, s, institute, for, public, policy, released, their, third, report, on, u, s, perceptions, including, the, general, public, politicians, and, scientists, of, nuclear, weapons, since, the, breakup, of, the, soviet, union, risks, of, nuclear, conflict, proliferation, and, terrorism, were, seen, as, substantial, while, maintenance, of, the, u, s, nuclear, arsenal, was, considered, above, average, in, importance, there, was, widespread, support, for, a, reduction, in, the, stockpile, and, very, little, support, for, developing, and, testing, new, nuclear, weapons, also, in, 1998, nuclear, weapons, became, an, issue, in, india, s, election, of, march, in, relation, to, political, tensions, with, neighboring, pakistan, prior, to, the, election, the, bharatiya, janata, party, bjp, announced, it, would, declare, india, a, nuclear, weapon, state, after, coming, to, power, bjp, won, the, elections, and, on, 14, may, three, days, after, india, tested, nuclear, weapons, for, the, second, time, a, public, opinion, poll, reported, that, a, majority, of, indians, favored, the, country, s, nuclear, build, up, on, 15, april, 2004, the, program, on, international, policy, attitudes, pipa, reported, that, u, s, citizens, showed, high, levels, of, concern, regarding, wmd, and, that, preventing, the, spread, of, nuclear, weapons, should, be, a, very, important, u, s, foreign, policy, goal, accomplished, through, multilateral, arms, control, rather, than, the, use, of, military, threats, a, majority, also, believed, the, united, states, should, be, more, forthcoming, with, its, biological, research, and, its, nuclear, non, proliferation, treaty, commitment, of, nuclear, arms, reduction, a, russian, opinion, poll, conducted, on, 5, august, 2005, indicated, half, the, population, believed, new, nuclear, powers, have, the, right, to, possess, nuclear, weapons, 39, believed, the, russian, stockpile, should, be, reduced, though, not, eliminated, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, their, related, impacts, have, been, a, mainstay, of, popular, culture, since, the, beginning, of, the, cold, war, as, both, political, commentary, and, humorous, outlet, the, actual, phrase, weapons, of, mass, destruction, has, been, used, similarly, and, as, a, way, to, characterise, any, powerful, force, or, product, since, the, iraqi, weapons, crisis, in, the, lead, up, to, the, coalition, invasion, of, iraq, in, 2003, science, fiction, may, introduce, novel, weapons, of, mass, destruction, with, much, greater, yields, or, impact, than, anything, in, reality, the, international, radioactivity, symbol, also, known, as, trefoil, first, appeared, in, 1946, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, radiation, laboratory, at, the, time, it, was, rendered, as, magenta, and, was, set, on, a, blue, background, it, is, drawn, with, a, central, circle, of, radius, r, the, blades, having, an, internal, radius, of, 1, 5, r, and, an, external, radius, of, 5, r, and, separated, from, each, other, by, 60, it, is, meant, to, represent, a, radiating, atom, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, found, that, the, trefoil, radiation, symbol, is, unintuitive, and, can, be, variously, interpreted, by, those, uneducated, in, its, meaning, therefore, its, role, as, a, hazard, warning, was, compromised, as, it, did, not, clearly, indicate, danger, to, many, non, westerners, and, children, who, encountered, it, as, a, result, of, research, a, new, radiation, hazard, symbol, iso, 21482, was, developed, in, 2007, to, be, placed, near, the, most, dangerous, parts, of, radiation, sources, featuring, a, skull, someone, running, away, and, using, a, red, rather, than, yellow, background, the, red, background, is, intended, to, convey, urgent, danger, and, the, sign, is, intended, to, be, used, on, equipment, where, very, strong, ionizing, radiation, can, be, encountered, if, the, device, is, dismantled, or, otherwise, tampered, with, the, intended, use, of, the, sign, is, not, in, a, place, where, the, normal, user, will, see, it, but, in, a, place, where, it, will, be, seen, by, someone, who, has, started, to, dismantle, a, radiation, emitting, device, or, equipment, the, aim, of, the, sign, is, to, warn, people, such, as, scrap, metal, workers, to, stop, work, and, leave, the, area, developed, by, dow, chemical, company, in, the, 1960s, for, their, containment, products, according, to, charles, dullin, an, environmental, health, engineer, who, contributed, to, its, development, we, wanted, something, that, was, memorable, but, meaningless, so, we, could, educate, people, as, to, what, it, means
