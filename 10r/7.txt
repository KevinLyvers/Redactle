intensive, agriculture, also, known, as, intensive, farming, as, opposed, to, extensive, farming, conventional, or, industrial, agriculture, is, a, type, of, agriculture, both, of, crop, plants, and, of, animals, with, higher, levels, of, input, and, output, per, unit, of, agricultural, land, area, it, is, characterized, by, a, low, fallow, ratio, higher, use, of, inputs, such, as, capital, labour, agrochemicals, and, water, and, higher, crop, yields, per, unit, land, area, most, commercial, agriculture, is, intensive, in, one, or, more, ways, forms, that, rely, heavily, on, industrial, methods, are, often, called, industrial, agriculture, which, is, characterised, by, technologies, designed, to, increase, yield, techniques, include, planting, multiple, crops, per, year, reducing, the, frequency, of, fallow, years, improving, cultivars, mechanised, agriculture, controlled, by, increased, and, more, detailed, analysis, of, growing, conditions, including, weather, soil, water, weeds, and, pests, modern, methods, frequently, involve, increased, use, of, non, biotic, inputs, such, as, fertilizers, plant, growth, regulators, pesticides, and, antibiotics, for, livestock, intensive, farms, are, widespread, in, developed, nations, and, increasingly, prevalent, worldwide, most, of, the, meat, dairy, products, eggs, fruits, and, vegetables, available, in, supermarkets, are, produced, by, such, farms, some, intensive, farms, can, use, sustainable, methods, although, this, typically, necessitates, higher, inputs, of, labor, or, lower, yields, sustainably, increasing, agricultural, productivity, especially, on, smallholdings, is, an, important, way, to, decrease, the, amount, of, land, needed, for, farming, and, slow, and, reverse, environmental, degradation, caused, by, processes, such, as, deforestation, intensive, animal, farming, involves, large, numbers, of, animals, raised, on, a, relatively, small, area, of, land, for, example, by, rotational, grazing, or, sometimes, as, concentrated, animal, feeding, operations, these, methods, increase, the, yields, of, food, and, fiber, per, unit, land, area, compared, to, those, of, extensive, animal, husbandry, concentrated, feed, is, brought, to, seldom, moved, animals, or, with, rotational, grazing, the, animals, are, repeatedly, moved, to, fresh, forage, agricultural, development, in, britain, between, the, 16th, century, and, the, mid, 19th, century, saw, a, massive, increase, in, agricultural, productivity, and, net, output, this, in, turn, contributed, to, unprecedented, population, growth, freeing, up, a, significant, percentage, of, the, workforce, and, thereby, helped, enable, the, industrial, revolution, historians, cited, enclosure, mechanization, four, field, crop, rotation, and, selective, breeding, as, the, most, important, innovations, industrial, agriculture, arose, in, the, industrial, revolution, by, the, early, 19th, century, agricultural, techniques, implements, seed, stocks, and, cultivars, had, so, improved, that, yield, per, land, unit, was, many, times, that, seen, in, the, middle, ages, the, first, phase, involved, a, continuing, process, of, mechanization, horse, drawn, machinery, such, as, the, mccormick, reaper, revolutionized, harvesting, while, inventions, such, as, the, cotton, gin, reduced, the, cost, of, processing, during, this, same, period, farmers, began, to, use, steam, powered, threshers, and, tractors, in, 1892, the, first, gasoline, powered, tractor, was, successfully, developed, and, in, 1923, the, international, harvester, farmall, tractor, became, the, first, all, purpose, tractor, marking, an, inflection, point, in, the, replacement, of, draft, animals, with, machines, mechanical, harvesters, combines, planters, transplanters, and, other, equipment, were, then, developed, further, revolutionizing, agriculture, these, inventions, increased, yields, and, allowed, individual, farmers, to, manage, increasingly, large, farms, the, identification, of, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, npk, as, critical, factors, in, plant, growth, led, to, the, manufacture, of, synthetic, fertilizers, further, increasing, crop, yields, in, 1909, the, haber, bosch, method, to, synthesize, ammonium, nitrate, was, first, demonstrated, npk, fertilizers, stimulated, the, first, concerns, about, industrial, agriculture, due, to, concerns, that, they, came, with, side, effects, such, as, soil, compaction, soil, erosion, and, declines, in, overall, soil, fertility, along, with, health, concerns, about, toxic, chemicals, entering, the, food, supply, the, discovery, of, vitamins, and, their, role, in, nutrition, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, led, to, vitamin, supplements, which, in, the, 1920s, allowed, some, livestock, to, be, raised, indoors, reducing, their, exposure, to, adverse, natural, elements, following, world, war, ii, synthetic, fertilizer, use, increased, rapidly, the, discovery, of, antibiotics, and, vaccines, facilitated, raising, livestock, by, reducing, diseases, developments, in, logistics, and, refrigeration, as, well, as, processing, technology, made, long, distance, distribution, feasible, integrated, pest, management, is, the, modern, method, to, minimize, pesticide, use, to, more, sustainable, levels, there, are, concerns, over, the, sustainability, of, industrial, agriculture, and, the, environmental, effects, of, fertilizers, and, pesticides, which, has, given, rise, to, the, organic, movement, and, has, built, a, market, for, sustainable, intensive, farming, as, well, as, funding, for, the, development, of, appropriate, technology, pasture, intensification, is, the, improvement, of, pasture, soils, and, grasses, to, increase, the, food, production, potential, of, livestock, systems, it, is, commonly, used, to, reverse, pasture, degradation, a, process, characterized, by, loss, of, forage, and, decreased, animal, carrying, capacity, which, results, from, overgrazing, poor, nutrient, management, and, lack, of, soil, conservation, this, degradation, leads, to, poor, pasture, soils, with, decreased, fertility, and, water, availability, and, increased, rates, of, erosion, compaction, and, acidification, degraded, pastures, have, significantly, lower, productivity, and, higher, carbon, footprints, compared, to, intensified, pastures, management, practices, which, improve, soil, health, and, consequently, grass, productivity, include, irrigation, soil, scarification, and, the, application, of, lime, fertilizers, and, pesticides, depending, on, the, productivity, goals, of, the, target, agricultural, system, more, involved, restoration, projects, can, be, undertaken, to, replace, invasive, and, under, productive, grasses, with, grass, species, that, are, better, suited, to, the, soil, and, climate, conditions, of, the, region, these, intensified, grass, systems, allow, higher, stocking, rates, with, faster, animal, weight, gain, and, reduced, time, to, slaughter, resulting, in, more, productive, carbon, efficient, livestock, systems, another, technique, to, optimize, yield, while, maintaining, the, carbon, balance, is, the, use, of, integrated, crop, livestock, icl, and, crop, livestock, forestry, iclf, systems, which, combine, several, ecosystems, into, one, optimized, agricultural, framework, correctly, performed, such, production, systems, are, able, to, create, synergies, potentially, providing, benefits, to, pastures, through, optimal, plant, usage, improved, feed, and, fattening, rates, increased, soil, fertility, and, quality, intensified, nutrient, cycling, integrated, pest, control, and, improved, biodiversity, the, introduction, of, certain, legume, crops, to, pastures, can, increase, carbon, accumulation, and, nitrogen, fixation, in, soils, while, their, digestibility, helps, animal, fattening, and, reduces, methane, emissions, from, enteric, fermentation, iclf, systems, yield, beef, cattle, productivity, up, to, ten, times, that, of, degraded, pastures, additional, crop, production, from, maize, sorghum, and, soybean, harvests, and, greatly, reduced, greenhouse, gas, balances, due, to, forest, carbon, sequestration, in, the, twelve, aprils, grazing, program, for, dairy, production, developed, by, the, usda, sare, forage, crops, for, dairy, herds, are, planted, into, a, perennial, pasture, rotational, grazing, is, a, variety, of, foraging, in, which, herds, or, flocks, are, regularly, and, systematically, moved, to, fresh, rested, grazing, areas, sometimes, called, paddocks, to, maximize, the, quality, and, quantity, of, forage, growth, it, can, be, used, with, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and, other, animals, the, herds, graze, one, portion, of, pasture, or, a, paddock, while, allowing, the, others, to, recover, resting, grazed, lands, allows, the, vegetation, to, renew, energy, reserves, rebuild, shoot, systems, and, deepen, root, systems, resulting, in, long, term, maximum, biomass, production, pasture, systems, alone, can, allow, grazers, to, meet, their, energy, requirements, but, rotational, grazing, is, especially, effective, because, grazers, thrive, on, the, more, tender, younger, plant, stems, parasites, are, also, left, behind, to, die, off, minimizing, or, eliminating, the, need, for, de, wormers, with, the, increased, productivity, of, rotational, systems, the, animals, may, need, less, supplemental, feed, than, in, continuous, grazing, systems, farmers, can, therefore, increase, stocking, rates, intensive, livestock, farming, or, factory, farming, is, the, process, of, raising, livestock, in, confinement, at, high, stocking, density, concentrated, animal, feeding, operations, cafo, or, intensive, livestock, operations, can, hold, large, numbers, some, up, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, cows, hogs, turkeys, or, chickens, often, indoors, the, essence, of, such, farms, is, the, concentration, of, livestock, in, a, given, space, the, aim, is, to, provide, maximum, output, at, the, lowest, possible, cost, and, with, the, greatest, level, of, food, safety, the, term, is, often, used, pejoratively, cafos, have, dramatically, increased, the, production, of, food, from, animal, husbandry, worldwide, both, in, terms, of, total, food, produced, and, efficiency, food, and, water, is, delivered, to, the, animals, and, therapeutic, use, of, antimicrobial, agents, vitamin, supplements, and, growth, hormones, are, often, employed, growth, hormones, are, not, used, on, chickens, nor, on, any, animal, in, the, european, union, undesirable, behaviors, often, related, to, the, stress, of, confinement, led, to, a, search, for, docile, breeds, e, g, with, natural, dominant, behaviors, bred, out, physical, restraints, to, stop, interaction, such, as, individual, cages, for, chickens, or, physical, modification, such, as, the, debeaking, of, chickens, to, reduce, the, harm, of, fighting, the, cafo, designation, resulted, from, the, 1972, u, s, federal, clean, water, act, which, was, enacted, to, protect, and, restore, lakes, and, rivers, to, a, fishable, swimmable, quality, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, identified, certain, animal, feeding, operations, along, with, many, other, types, of, industry, as, point, source, groundwater, polluters, these, operations, were, subjected, to, regulation, in, 17, states, in, the, u, s, isolated, cases, of, groundwater, contamination, were, linked, to, cafos, the, u, s, federal, government, acknowledges, the, waste, disposal, issue, and, requires, that, animal, waste, be, stored, in, lagoons, these, lagoons, can, be, as, large, as, 7, 5, acres, 30, 000, m, 2, lagoons, not, protected, with, an, impermeable, liner, can, leak, into, groundwater, under, some, conditions, as, can, runoff, from, manure, used, as, fertilizer, a, lagoon, that, burst, in, 1995, released, 25, million, gallons, of, nitrous, sludge, in, north, carolina, s, new, river, the, spill, allegedly, killed, eight, to, ten, million, fish, the, large, concentration, of, animals, animal, waste, and, dead, animals, in, a, small, space, poses, ethical, issues, to, some, consumers, animal, rights, and, animal, welfare, activists, have, charged, that, intensive, animal, rearing, is, cruel, to, animals, the, green, revolution, transformed, farming, in, many, developing, countries, it, spread, technologies, that, had, already, existed, but, had, not, been, widely, used, outside, of, industrialized, nations, these, technologies, included, miracle, seeds, pesticides, irrigation, and, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, in, the, 1970s, scientists, created, high, yielding, varieties, of, maize, wheat, and, rice, these, have, an, increased, nitrogen, absorbing, potential, compared, to, other, varieties, since, cereals, that, absorbed, extra, nitrogen, would, typically, lodge, fall, over, before, harvest, semi, dwarfing, genes, were, bred, into, their, genomes, norin, 10, wheat, a, variety, developed, by, orville, vogel, from, japanese, dwarf, wheat, varieties, was, instrumental, in, developing, wheat, cultivars, ir8, the, first, widely, implemented, high, yielding, rice, to, be, developed, by, the, international, rice, research, institute, was, created, through, a, cross, between, an, indonesian, variety, named, peta, and, a, chinese, variety, named, dee, geo, woo, gen, with, the, availability, of, molecular, genetics, in, arabidopsis, and, rice, the, mutant, genes, responsible, reduced, height, rht, gibberellin, insensitive, gai1, and, slender, rice, slr1, have, been, cloned, and, identified, as, cellular, signalling, components, of, gibberellic, acid, a, phytohormone, involved, in, regulating, stem, growth, via, its, effect, on, cell, division, photosynthate, investment, in, the, stem, is, reduced, dramatically, in, shorter, plants, and, nutrients, become, redirected, to, grain, production, amplifying, in, particular, the, yield, effect, of, chemical, fertilizers, high, yielding, varieties, outperformed, traditional, varieties, several, fold, and, responded, better, to, the, addition, of, irrigation, pesticides, and, fertilizers, hybrid, vigour, is, utilized, in, many, important, crops, to, greatly, increase, yields, for, farmers, however, the, advantage, is, lost, for, the, progeny, of, the, f1, hybrids, meaning, seeds, for, annual, crops, need, to, be, purchased, every, season, thus, increasing, costs, and, profits, for, farmers, crop, rotation, or, crop, sequencing, is, the, practice, of, growing, a, series, of, dissimilar, types, of, crops, in, the, same, space, in, sequential, seasons, for, benefits, such, as, avoiding, pathogen, and, pest, buildup, that, occurs, when, one, species, is, continuously, cropped, crop, rotation, also, seeks, to, balance, the, nutrient, demands, of, various, crops, to, avoid, soil, nutrient, depletion, a, traditional, component, of, crop, rotation, is, the, replenishment, of, nitrogen, through, the, use, of, legumes, and, green, manure, in, sequence, with, cereals, and, other, crops, crop, rotation, can, also, improve, soil, structure, and, fertility, by, alternating, deep, rooted, and, shallow, rooted, plants, a, related, technique, is, to, plant, multi, species, cover, crops, between, commercial, crops, this, combines, the, advantages, of, intensive, farming, with, continuous, cover, and, polyculture, crop, irrigation, accounts, for, 70, of, the, world, s, fresh, water, use, flood, irrigation, the, oldest, and, most, common, type, is, typically, unevenly, distributed, as, parts, of, a, field, may, receive, excess, water, in, order, to, deliver, sufficient, quantities, to, other, parts, overhead, irrigation, using, center, pivot, or, lateral, moving, sprinklers, gives, a, much, more, equal, and, controlled, distribution, pattern, drip, irrigation, is, the, most, expensive, and, least, used, type, but, delivers, water, to, plant, roots, with, minimal, losses, water, catchment, management, measures, include, recharge, pits, which, capture, rainwater, and, runoff, and, use, it, to, recharge, groundwater, supplies, this, helps, in, the, replenishment, of, groundwater, wells, and, eventually, reduces, soil, erosion, dammed, rivers, creating, reservoirs, store, water, for, irrigation, and, other, uses, over, large, areas, smaller, areas, sometimes, use, irrigation, ponds, or, groundwater, in, agriculture, systematic, weed, management, is, usually, required, often, performed, by, machines, such, as, cultivators, or, liquid, herbicide, sprayers, herbicides, kill, specific, targets, while, leaving, the, crop, relatively, unharmed, some, of, these, act, by, interfering, with, the, growth, of, the, weed, and, are, often, based, on, plant, hormones, weed, control, through, herbicide, is, made, more, difficult, when, the, weeds, become, resistant, to, the, herbicide, solutions, include, in, agriculture, a, terrace, is, a, leveled, section, of, a, hilly, cultivated, area, designed, as, a, method, of, soil, conservation, to, slow, or, prevent, the, rapid, surface, runoff, of, irrigation, water, often, such, land, is, formed, into, multiple, terraces, giving, a, stepped, appearance, the, human, landscapes, of, rice, cultivation, in, terraces, that, follow, the, natural, contours, of, the, escarpments, like, contour, ploughing, are, a, classic, feature, of, the, island, of, bali, and, the, banaue, rice, terraces, in, banaue, ifugao, philippines, in, peru, the, inca, made, use, of, otherwise, unusable, slopes, by, building, drystone, walls, to, create, terraces, known, as, and, ns, a, paddy, field, is, a, flooded, parcel, of, arable, land, used, for, growing, rice, and, other, semiaquatic, crops, paddy, fields, are, a, typical, feature, of, rice, growing, countries, of, east, and, southeast, asia, including, malaysia, china, sri, lanka, myanmar, thailand, korea, japan, vietnam, taiwan, indonesia, india, and, the, philippines, they, are, also, found, in, other, rice, growing, regions, such, as, piedmont, italy, the, camargue, france, and, the, artibonite, valley, haiti, they, can, occur, naturally, along, rivers, or, marshes, or, can, be, constructed, even, on, hillsides, they, require, large, water, quantities, for, irrigation, much, of, it, from, flooding, it, gives, an, environment, favourable, to, the, strain, of, rice, being, grown, and, is, hostile, to, many, species, of, weeds, as, the, only, draft, animal, species, which, is, comfortable, in, wetlands, the, water, buffalo, is, in, widespread, use, in, asian, rice, paddies, a, recent, development, in, the, intensive, production, of, rice, is, the, system, of, rice, intensification, developed, in, 1983, by, the, french, jesuit, father, henri, de, laulani, in, madagascar, by, 2013, the, number, of, smallholder, farmers, using, the, system, had, grown, to, between, 4, and, 5, million, aquaculture, is, the, cultivation, of, the, natural, products, of, water, fish, shellfish, algae, seaweed, and, other, aquatic, organisms, intensive, aquaculture, takes, place, on, land, using, tanks, ponds, or, other, controlled, systems, or, in, the, ocean, using, cages, intensive, farming, practices, which, are, thought, to, be, sustainable, have, been, developed, to, slow, the, deterioration, of, agricultural, land, and, even, regenerate, soil, health, and, ecosystem, services, these, developments, may, fall, in, the, category, of, organic, farming, or, the, integration, of, organic, and, conventional, agriculture, pasture, cropping, involves, planting, grain, crops, directly, into, grassland, without, first, applying, herbicides, the, perennial, grasses, form, a, living, mulch, understory, to, the, grain, crop, eliminating, the, need, to, plant, cover, crops, after, harvest, the, pasture, is, intensively, grazed, both, before, and, after, grain, production, this, intensive, system, yields, equivalent, farmer, profits, partly, from, increased, livestock, forage, while, building, new, topsoil, and, sequestering, up, to, 33, tons, of, co, 2, ha, year, biointensive, agriculture, focuses, on, maximizing, efficiency, such, as, per, unit, area, energy, input, and, water, input, agroforestry, combines, agriculture, and, orchard, forestry, technologies, to, create, more, integrated, diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and, sustainable, land, use, systems, intercropping, can, increase, yields, or, reduce, inputs, and, thus, represents, potentially, sustainable, agricultural, intensification, however, while, total, yield, per, unit, land, area, is, often, increased, yields, of, any, single, crop, often, decrease, there, are, also, challenges, to, farmers, who, rely, on, farming, equipment, optimized, for, monoculture, often, resulting, in, increased, labor, inputs, vertical, farming, is, intensive, crop, production, on, a, large, scale, in, urban, centers, in, multi, story, artificially, lit, structures, for, the, production, of, low, calorie, foods, like, herbs, microgreens, and, lettuce, an, integrated, farming, system, is, a, progressive, sustainable, agriculture, system, such, as, zero, waste, agriculture, or, integrated, multi, trophic, aquaculture, which, involves, the, interactions, of, multiple, species, elements, of, this, integration, can, include, industrial, agriculture, uses, huge, amounts, of, water, energy, and, industrial, chemicals, increasing, pollution, in, the, arable, land, usable, water, and, atmosphere, herbicides, insecticides, and, fertilizers, accumulate, in, ground, and, surface, waters, industrial, agricultural, practices, are, one, of, the, main, drivers, of, global, warming, accounting, for, 14, 28, of, net, greenhouse, gas, emissions, many, of, the, negative, effects, of, industrial, agriculture, may, emerge, at, some, distance, from, fields, and, farms, nitrogen, compounds, from, the, midwest, for, example, travel, down, the, mississippi, to, degrade, coastal, fisheries, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, causing, so, called, oceanic, dead, zones, many, wild, plant, and, animal, species, have, become, extinct, on, a, regional, or, national, scale, and, the, functioning, of, agro, ecosystems, has, been, profoundly, altered, agricultural, intensification, includes, a, variety, of, factors, including, the, loss, of, landscape, elements, increased, farm, and, field, sizes, and, increase, usage, of, insecticides, and, herbicides, the, large, scale, of, insecticides, and, herbicides, lead, to, the, rapid, developing, resistance, among, pests, renders, herbicides, and, insecticides, increasingly, ineffective, agrochemicals, have, may, be, involved, in, colony, collapse, disorder, in, which, the, individual, members, of, bee, colonies, disappear, agricultural, production, is, highly, dependent, on, bees, to, pollinate, many, varieties, of, fruits, and, vegetables, intensive, farming, creates, conditions, for, parasite, growth, and, transmission, that, are, vastly, different, from, what, parasites, encounter, in, natural, host, populations, potentially, altering, selection, on, a, variety, of, traits, such, as, life, history, traits, and, virulence, some, recent, epidemic, outbreaks, have, highlighted, the, association, with, intensive, agricultural, farming, practices, for, example, the, infectious, salmon, anaemia, isa, virus, is, causing, significant, economic, loss, for, salmon, farms, the, isa, virus, is, an, orthomyxovirus, with, two, distinct, clades, one, european, and, one, north, american, that, diverged, before, 1900, kross, y, et, al, 2001, this, divergence, suggests, that, an, ancestral, form, of, the, virus, was, present, in, wild, salmonids, prior, to, the, introduction, of, cage, cultured, salmonids, as, the, virus, spread, from, vertical, transmission, parent, to, offspring, intensive, monoculture, increases, the, risk, of, failures, due, to, pests, adverse, weather, and, disease, a, study, for, the, u, s, office, of, technology, assessment, concluded, that, regarding, industrial, agriculture, there, is, a, negative, relationship, between, the, trend, toward, increasing, farm, size, and, the, social, conditions, in, rural, communities, on, a, statistical, level, agricultural, monoculture, can, entail, social, and, economic, risks
