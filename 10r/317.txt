electrical, wiring, is, an, electrical, installation, of, cabling, and, associated, devices, such, as, switches, distribution, boards, sockets, and, light, fittings, in, a, structure, wiring, is, subject, to, safety, standards, for, design, and, installation, allowable, wire, and, cable, types, and, sizes, are, specified, according, to, the, circuit, operating, voltage, and, electric, current, capability, with, further, restrictions, on, the, environmental, conditions, such, as, ambient, temperature, range, moisture, levels, and, exposure, to, sunlight, and, chemicals, associated, circuit, protection, control, and, distribution, devices, within, a, building, s, wiring, system, are, subject, to, voltage, current, and, functional, specifications, wiring, safety, codes, vary, by, locality, country, or, region, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, is, attempting, to, harmonise, wiring, standards, among, member, countries, but, significant, variations, in, design, and, installation, requirements, still, exist, wiring, installation, codes, and, regulations, are, intended, to, protect, people, and, property, from, electrical, shock, and, fire, hazards, they, are, usually, based, on, a, model, code, with, or, without, local, amendments, produced, by, a, national, or, international, standards, organisation, such, as, the, iec, in, australia, and, new, zealand, the, as, nzs, 3000, standard, commonly, known, as, the, wiring, rules, specifies, requirements, for, the, selection, and, installation, of, electrical, equipment, and, the, design, and, testing, of, such, installations, the, standard, is, mandatory, in, both, new, zealand, and, australia, therefore, all, electrical, work, covered, by, the, standard, must, comply, in, european, countries, an, attempt, has, been, made, to, harmonise, national, wiring, standards, in, an, iec, standard, iec, 60364, electrical, installations, for, buildings, hence, national, standards, follow, an, identical, system, of, sections, and, chapters, however, this, standard, is, not, written, in, such, language, that, it, can, readily, be, adopted, as, a, national, wiring, code, neither, is, it, designed, for, field, use, by, electrical, tradespeople, and, inspectors, for, testing, compliance, with, national, wiring, standards, by, contrast, national, codes, such, as, the, nec, or, csa, c22, 1, generally, exemplify, the, common, objectives, of, iec, 60364, but, provide, specific, rules, in, a, form, that, allows, for, guidance, of, those, installing, and, inspecting, electrical, systems, the, vde, is, the, organisation, responsible, for, the, promulgation, of, electrical, standards, and, safety, specifications, din, vde, 0100, is, the, german, wiring, regulations, document, harmonised, with, iec, 60364, in, germany, blue, can, also, mean, phase, or, switched, phase, in, the, united, kingdom, wiring, installations, are, regulated, by, the, institution, of, engineering, and, technology, requirements, for, electrical, installations, iee, wiring, regulations, bs, 7671, 2008, which, are, harmonised, with, iec, 60364, the, 17th, edition, issued, in, january, 2008, included, new, sections, for, microgeneration, and, solar, photovoltaic, systems, the, first, edition, was, published, in, 1882, in, 2018, the, 18th, edition, of, the, wiring, regulations, bs7671, 2018, was, released, and, came, into, force, in, january, 2019, and, bs7671, 2018, amendment, 2, was, issued, march, 2022, bs, 7671, is, the, standard, to, which, the, uk, electrical, industry, adheres, and, compliance, with, bs, 7671, is, now, required, by, law, through, the, electricity, safety, quality, and, continuity, regulations, 2002, the, first, electrical, codes, in, the, united, states, originated, in, new, york, in, 1881, to, regulate, installations, of, electric, lighting, since, 1897, the, us, national, fire, protection, association, a, private, non, profit, association, formed, by, insurance, companies, has, published, the, national, electrical, code, nec, states, counties, or, cities, often, include, the, nec, in, their, local, building, codes, by, reference, along, with, local, differences, the, nec, is, modified, every, three, years, it, is, a, consensus, code, considering, suggestions, from, interested, parties, the, proposals, are, studied, by, committees, of, engineers, tradesmen, manufacturer, representatives, fire, fighters, and, other, invitees, since, 1927, the, canadian, standards, association, csa, has, produced, the, canadian, safety, standard, for, electrical, installations, which, is, the, basis, for, provincial, electrical, codes, the, csa, also, produces, the, canadian, electrical, code, the, 2006, edition, of, which, references, iec, 60364, electrical, installations, for, buildings, and, states, that, the, code, addresses, the, fundamental, principles, of, electrical, protection, in, section, 131, the, canadian, code, reprints, chapter, 13, of, iec, 60364, but, there, are, no, numerical, criteria, listed, in, that, chapter, to, assess, the, adequacy, of, any, electrical, installation, although, the, us, and, canadian, national, standards, deal, with, the, same, physical, phenomena, and, broadly, similar, objectives, they, differ, occasionally, in, technical, detail, as, part, of, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, nafta, program, us, and, canadian, standards, are, slowly, converging, toward, each, other, in, a, process, known, as, harmonisation, in, a, typical, electrical, code, some, colour, coding, of, wires, is, mandatory, many, local, rules, and, exceptions, exist, per, country, state, or, region, older, installations, vary, in, colour, codes, and, colours, may, fade, with, insulation, exposure, to, heat, light, and, aging, from, 1970, european, countries, started, a, process, of, harmonising, their, wiring, colours, as, several, countries, had, chosen, the, same, colour, to, denote, different, wires, the, new, harmonised, colours, were, chosen, mainly, because, no, country, had, used, them, colours, like, pink, orange, and, turquoise, were, not, available, as, they, were, deemed, to, be, too, close, to, other, colours, even, so, there, were, unavoidable, clashes, blue, was, a, phase, conductor, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, which, delayed, the, adoption, of, the, new, colours, for, several, decades, but, flexible, cable, was, changed, pretty, much, instantly, following, pressure, from, manufacturers, of, appliances, as, of, march, 2011, the, european, committee, for, electrotechnical, standardization, cenelec, requires, the, use, of, green, yellow, colour, cables, as, protective, conductors, blue, as, neutral, conductors, and, brown, as, single, phase, conductors, in, sweden, iec, 60364, is, implemented, through, the, national, standard, ss, 436, 40, 000, notable, is, the, exception, for, blue, where, while, the, colour, normally, is, used, for, neutral, may, be, used, as, connecting, wire, between, switches, and, between, switch, and, fixture, as, well, as, phase, wire, in, a, two, phase, circuit, all, under, the, condition, that, no, neutral, wire, is, used, in, the, particular, circuit, the, united, kingdom, requires, the, use, of, wire, covered, with, green, yellow, striped, insulation, for, safety, earthing, grounding, connections, this, growing, international, standard, was, adopted, for, its, distinctive, appearance, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, dangerous, confusion, of, safety, earthing, grounding, wires, with, other, electrical, functions, especially, by, persons, affected, by, red, green, colour, blindness, in, 2004, the, uk, adopted, the, european, union, standard, for, phase, colours, of, brown, black, and, grey, and, for, neutral, blue, however, the, old, phase, colours, of, red, yellow, and, blue, with, black, for, neutral, are, still, found, in, old, installations, single, phase, wiring, should, strictly, be, in, brown, red, in, old, system, regardless, of, which, phase, it, originated, from, but, it, is, common, practice, to, use, three, core, cable, in, the, three, phase, colours, for, two, way, lighting, switches, the, accepted, practice, is, to, sleeve, the, ends, of, the, cores, in, brown, or, blue, sleeves, as, appropriate, the, united, states, national, electrical, code, requires, a, bare, copper, or, green, or, green, yellow, insulated, protective, conductor, a, white, or, grey, neutral, with, any, other, colour, used, for, single, phase, the, nec, also, requires, the, high, leg, conductor, of, a, high, leg, delta, system, to, have, orange, insulation, or, to, be, identified, by, other, suitable, means, such, as, tagging, prior, to, the, adoption, of, orange, as, the, suggested, colour, for, the, high, leg, in, the, 1971, nec, it, was, common, practice, in, some, areas, to, use, red, for, this, purpose, the, introduction, of, the, nec, clearly, states, that, it, is, not, intended, to, be, a, design, manual, and, therefore, creating, a, colour, code, for, ungrounded, or, hot, conductors, falls, outside, the, scope, and, purpose, of, the, nec, however, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, hot, conductor, colour, coding, is, required, by, the, code, in, the, united, states, colour, coding, of, three, phase, system, conductors, follows, a, de, facto, standard, wherein, black, red, and, blue, are, used, for, three, phase, 120, 208, volt, systems, and, brown, orange, or, violet, and, yellow, are, used, in, 277, 480, volt, systems, violet, avoids, conflict, with, the, nec, s, high, leg, delta, rule, in, buildings, with, multiple, voltage, systems, the, grounded, conductors, neutrals, of, both, systems, are, required, to, be, separately, identified, and, made, distinguishable, to, avoid, cross, system, connections, most, often, 120, 208, volt, systems, use, white, insulation, while, 277, 480, volt, systems, use, grey, insulation, although, this, particular, colour, code, is, not, currently, an, explicit, requirement, of, the, nec, some, local, jurisdictions, do, specify, required, colour, coding, in, their, local, building, codes, however, recommended, for, single, phase, recommended, for, multiphase, while, light, blue, is, prohibited, from, use, for, active, function, dark, blue, is, recommended, for, l3, usually, used, for, switched, line, to, designate, any, phase, the, below, colours, are, prohibited, to, designate, any, phase, the, below, colours, are, prohibited, see, ja, for, details, 277, or, 480, v,

liquids, special, rules, may, govern, the, installation, and, wiring, of, electrical, equipment, in, hazardous, areas, wires, and, cables, are, rated, by, the, circuit, voltage, temperature, rating, and, environmental, conditions, moisture, sunlight, oil, chemicals, in, which, they, can, be, used, a, wire, or, cable, has, a, voltage, to, neutral, rating, and, a, maximum, conductor, surface, temperature, rating, the, amount, of, current, a, cable, or, wire, can, safely, carry, depends, on, the, installation, conditions, the, international, standard, wire, sizes, are, given, in, the, iec, 60228, standard, of, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, in, north, america, the, american, wire, gauge, standard, for, wire, sizes, is, used, modern, non, metallic, sheathed, cables, such, as, us, and, canadian, types, nmb, and, nmc, consist, of, two, to, four, wires, covered, with, thermoplastic, insulation, plus, a, wire, for, protective, earthing, grounding, bonding, surrounded, by, a, flexible, plastic, jacket, in, north, america, and, the, uk, this, conductor, is, usually, bare, wire, but, in, the, uk, it, is, required, that, this, bare, protective, earth, pe, conductor, be, sheathed, in, green, yellow, insulating, tubing, where, the, cable, sheathing, has, been, removed, most, other, jurisdictions, now, require, the, protective, earth, conductor, to, be, insulated, to, the, same, standard, as, the, current, carrying, conductors, with, green, yellow, insulation, with, some, cables, the, individual, conductors, are, wrapped, in, paper, before, the, plastic, jacket, is, applied, special, versions, of, non, metallic, sheathed, cables, such, as, us, type, uf, are, designed, for, direct, underground, burial, often, with, separate, mechanical, protection, or, exterior, use, where, exposure, to, ultraviolet, radiation, uv, is, a, possibility, these, cables, differ, in, having, a, moisture, resistant, construction, lacking, paper, or, other, absorbent, fillers, and, being, formulated, for, uv, resistance, rubber, like, synthetic, polymer, insulation, is, used, in, industrial, cables, and, power, cables, installed, underground, because, of, its, superior, moisture, resistance, insulated, cables, are, rated, by, their, allowable, operating, voltage, and, their, maximum, operating, temperature, at, the, conductor, surface, a, cable, may, carry, multiple, usage, ratings, for, applications, for, example, one, rating, for, dry, installations, and, another, when, exposed, to, moisture, or, oil, generally, single, conductor, building, wire, in, small, sizes, is, solid, wire, since, the, wiring, is, not, required, to, be, very, flexible, building, wire, conductors, larger, than, 10, awg, or, about, 5, mm, 2, are, stranded, for, flexibility, during, installation, but, are, not, sufficiently, pliable, to, use, as, appliance, cord, cables, for, industrial, commercial, and, apartment, buildings, may, contain, many, insulated, conductors, in, an, overall, jacket, with, helical, tape, steel, or, aluminium, armour, or, steel, wire, armour, and, perhaps, as, well, an, overall, pvc, or, lead, jacket, for, protection, from, moisture, and, physical, damage, cables, intended, for, very, flexible, service, or, in, marine, applications, may, be, protected, by, woven, bronze, wires, power, or, communications, cables, e, g, computer, networking, that, are, routed, in, or, through, air, handling, spaces, plenums, of, office, buildings, are, required, under, the, model, building, code, to, be, either, encased, in, metal, conduit, or, rated, for, low, flame, and, smoke, production, for, some, industrial, uses, in, steel, mills, and, similar, hot, environments, no, organic, material, gives, satisfactory, service, cables, insulated, with, compressed, mica, flakes, are, sometimes, used, another, form, of, high, temperature, cable, is, mineral, insulated, cable, with, individual, conductors, placed, within, a, copper, tube, and, the, space, filled, with, magnesium, oxide, powder, the, whole, assembly, is, drawn, down, to, smaller, sizes, thereby, compressing, the, powder, such, cables, have, a, certified, fire, resistance, rating, and, are, more, costly, than, non, fire, rated, cable, they, have, little, flexibility, and, behave, more, like, rigid, conduit, rather, than, flexible, cables, the, environment, of, the, installed, wires, determine, how, much, current, a, cable, is, permitted, to, carry, because, multiple, conductors, bundled, in, a, cable, cannot, dissipate, heat, as, easily, as, single, insulated, conductors, those, circuits, are, always, rated, at, a, lower, ampacity, tables, in, electrical, safety, codes, give, the, maximum, allowable, current, based, on, size, of, conductor, voltage, potential, insulation, type, and, thickness, and, the, temperature, rating, of, the, cable, itself, the, allowable, current, will, also, be, different, for, wet, or, dry, locations, for, hot, attic, or, cool, underground, locations, in, a, run, of, cable, through, several, areas, the, part, with, the, lowest, rating, becomes, the, rating, of, the, overall, run, cables, usually, are, secured, with, special, fittings, where, they, enter, electrical, apparatus, this, may, be, a, simple, screw, clamp, for, jacketed, cables, in, a, dry, location, or, a, polymer, gasketed, cable, connector, that, mechanically, engages, the, armour, of, an, armoured, cable, and, provides, a, water, resistant, connection, special, cable, fittings, may, be, applied, to, prevent, explosive, gases, from, flowing, in, the, interior, of, jacketed, cables, where, the, cable, passes, through, areas, where, flammable, gases, are, present, to, prevent, loosening, of, the, connections, of, individual, conductors, of, a, cable, cables, must, be, supported, near, their, entrance, to, devices, and, at, regular, intervals, along, their, runs, in, tall, buildings, special, designs, are, required, to, support, the, conductors, of, vertical, runs, of, cable, generally, only, one, cable, per, fitting, is, permitted, unless, the, fitting, is, rated, or, listed, for, multiple, cables, special, cable, constructions, and, termination, techniques, are, required, for, cables, installed, in, ships, such, assemblies, are, subjected, to, environmental, and, mechanical, extremes, therefore, in, addition, to, electrical, and, fire, safety, concerns, such, cables, may, also, be, required, to, be, pressure, resistant, where, they, penetrate, a, vessel, s, bulkheads, they, must, also, resist, corrosion, caused, by, salt, water, or, salt, spray, which, is, accomplished, through, the, use, of, thicker, specially, constructed, jackets, and, by, tinning, the, individual, wire, stands, in, north, american, practice, for, residential, and, light, commercial, buildings, fed, with, a, single, phase, split, 120, 240, service, an, overhead, cable, from, a, transformer, on, a, power, pole, is, run, to, the, service, entrance, point, the, cable, is, a, three, conductor, twisted, triplex, cable, with, a, bare, neutral, and, two, insulated, conductors, with, no, overall, cable, jacket, the, neutral, conductor, is, often, a, supporting, messenger, steel, wire, which, is, used, to, support, the, insulated, line, conductors, electrical, devices, often, use, copper, conductors, because, of, their, properties, including, their, high, electrical, conductivity, tensile, strength, ductility, creep, resistance, corrosion, resistance, thermal, conductivity, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, solderability, resistance, to, electrical, overloads, compatibility, with, electrical, insulators, and, ease, of, installation, copper, is, used, in, many, types, of, electrical, wiring, aluminium, wire, was, common, in, north, american, residential, wiring, from, the, late, 1960s, to, mid, 1970s, due, to, the, rising, cost, of, copper, because, of, its, greater, resistivity, aluminium, wiring, requires, larger, conductors, than, copper, for, instance, instead, of, 14, awg, american, wire, gauge, copper, wire, aluminium, wiring, would, need, to, be, 12, awg, on, a, typical, 15, ampere, lighting, circuit, though, local, building, codes, vary, solid, aluminium, conductors, were, originally, made, in, the, 1960s, from, a, utility, grade, aluminium, alloy, that, had, undesirable, properties, for, a, building, wire, and, were, used, with, wiring, devices, intended, for, copper, conductors, these, practices, were, found, to, cause, defective, connections, and, fire, hazards, in, the, early, 1970s, new, aluminium, wire, made, from, one, of, several, special, alloys, was, introduced, and, all, devices, breakers, switches, receptacles, splice, connectors, wire, nuts, etc, were, specially, designed, for, the, purpose, these, newer, aluminium, wires, and, special, designs, address, problems, with, junctions, between, dissimilar, metals, oxidation, on, metal, surfaces, and, mechanical, effects, that, occur, as, different, metals, expand, at, different, rates, with, increases, in, temperature, unlike, copper, aluminium, has, a, tendency, to, creep, or, cold, flow, under, pressure, so, older, plain, steel, screw, clamped, connections, could, become, loose, over, time, newer, electrical, devices, designed, for, aluminium, conductors, have, features, intended, to, compensate, for, this, effect, unlike, copper, aluminium, forms, an, insulating, oxide, layer, on, the, surface, this, is, sometimes, addressed, by, coating, aluminium, conductors, with, an, antioxidant, paste, containing, zinc, dust, in, a, low, residue, polybutene, base, at, joints, or, by, applying, a, mechanical, termination, designed, to, break, through, the, oxide, layer, during, installation, some, terminations, on, wiring, devices, designed, only, for, copper, wire, would, overheat, under, heavy, current, load, and, cause, fires, when, used, with, aluminium, conductors, revised, standards, for, wire, materials, and, wiring, devices, such, as, the, co, alr, copper, aluminium, revised, designation, were, developed, to, reduce, these, problems, while, larger, sizes, are, still, used, to, feed, power, to, electrical, panels, and, large, devices, aluminium, wiring, for, residential, use, has, acquired, a, poor, reputation, and, has, fallen, out, of, favour, aluminium, conductors, are, still, heavily, used, for, bulk, power, transmission, power, distribution, and, large, feeder, circuits, with, heavy, current, loads, due, to, the, various, advantages, they, offer, over, copper, wiring, aluminium, conductors, both, cost, and, weigh, less, than, copper, conductors, so, a, much, larger, cross, sectional, area, can, be, used, for, the, same, weight, and, price, this, can, compensate, for, the, higher, resistance, and, lower, mechanical, strength, of, aluminium, meaning, the, larger, cross, sectional, area, is, needed, to, achieve, comparable, current, capacity, and, other, features, aluminium, conductors, must, be, installed, with, compatible, connectors, and, special, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, the, contact, surface, does, not, oxidise, insulated, wires, may, be, run, in, one, of, several, forms, between, electrical, devices, this, may, be, a, specialised, bendable, pipe, called, a, conduit, or, one, of, several, varieties, of, metal, rigid, steel, or, aluminium, or, non, metallic, pvc, or, hdpe, tubing, rectangular, cross, section, metal, or, pvc, wire, troughs, north, america, or, trunking, uk, may, be, used, if, many, circuits, are, required, wires, run, underground, may, be, run, in, plastic, tubing, encased, in, concrete, but, metal, elbows, may, be, used, in, severe, pulls, wiring, in, exposed, areas, for, example, factory, floors, may, be, run, in, cable, trays, or, rectangular, raceways, having, lids, where, wiring, or, raceways, that, hold, the, wiring, must, traverse, fire, resistance, rated, walls, and, floors, the, openings, are, required, by, local, building, codes, to, be, firestopped, in, cases, where, safety, critical, wiring, must, be, kept, operational, during, an, accidental, fire, fireproofing, must, be, applied, to, maintain, circuit, integrity, in, a, manner, to, comply, with, a, product, s, certification, listing, the, nature, and, thickness, of, any, passive, fire, protection, materials, used, in, conjunction, with, wiring, and, raceways, has, a, quantifiable, impact, upon, the, ampacity, derating, because, the, thermal, insulation, properties, needed, for, fire, resistance, also, inhibit, air, cooling, of, power, conductors, cable, trays, are, used, in, industrial, areas, where, many, insulated, cables, are, run, together, individual, cables, can, exit, the, tray, at, any, point, simplifying, the, wiring, installation, and, reducing, the, labour, cost, for, installing, new, cables, power, cables, may, have, fittings, in, the, tray, to, maintain, clearance, between, the, conductors, but, small, control, wiring, is, often, installed, without, any, intentional, spacing, between, cables, local, electrical, regulations, may, restrict, or, place, special, requirements, on, mixing, of, voltage, levels, within, one, cable, tray, good, design, practices, may, segregate, for, example, low, level, measurement, or, signal, cables, from, trays, carrying, high, power, branch, circuits, to, prevent, induction, of, noise, into, sensitive, circuits, since, wires, run, in, conduits, or, underground, cannot, dissipate, heat, as, easily, as, in, open, air, and, since, adjacent, circuits, contribute, induced, currents, wiring, regulations, give, rules, to, establish, the, current, capacity, ampacity, special, sealed, fittings, are, used, for, wiring, routed, through, potentially, explosive, atmospheres, for, very, high, currents, in, electrical, apparatus, and, for, high, currents, distributed, through, a, building, bus, bars, can, be, used, the, term, bus, is, a, contraction, of, the, latin, omnibus, meaning, for, all, each, live, hot, conductor, of, such, a, system, is, a, rigid, piece, of, copper, or, aluminium, usually, in, flat, bars, but, sometimes, as, tubing, or, other, shapes, open, bus, bars, are, never, used, in, publicly, accessible, areas, although, they, are, used, in, manufacturing, plants, and, power, company, switch, yards, to, gain, the, benefit, of, air, cooling, a, variation, is, to, use, heavy, cables, especially, where, it, is, desirable, to, transpose, or, roll, phases, in, industrial, applications, conductor, bars, are, often, pre, assembled, with, insulators, in, grounded, enclosures, this, assembly, known, as, bus, duct, or, busway, can, be, used, for, connections, to, large, switchgear, or, for, bringing, the, main, power, feed, into, a, building, a, form, of, bus, duct, known, as, plug, in, bus, is, used, to, distribute, power, down, the, length, of, a, building, it, is, constructed, to, allow, tap, off, switches, or, motor, controllers, to, be, installed, at, designated, places, along, the, bus, the, big, advantage, of, this, scheme, is, the, ability, to, remove, or, add, a, branch, circuit, without, removing, voltage, from, the, whole, duct, bus, ducts, may, have, all, phase, conductors, in, the, same, enclosure, non, isolated, bus, or, may, have, each, conductor, separated, by, a, grounded, barrier, from, the, adjacent, phases, segregated, bus, for, conducting, large, currents, between, devices, a, cable, bus, is, used, for, very, large, currents, in, generating, stations, or, substations, where, it, is, difficult, to, provide, circuit, protection, an, isolated, phase, bus, is, used, each, phase, of, the, circuit, is, run, in, a, separate, grounded, metal, enclosure, the, only, fault, possible, is, a, phase, to, ground, fault, since, the, enclosures, are, separated, this, type, of, bus, can, be, rated, up, to, 50, 000, amperes, and, up, to, hundreds, of, kilovolts, during, normal, service, not, just, for, faults, but, is, not, used, for, building, wiring, in, the, conventional, sense, electrical, panels, are, easily, accessible, junction, boxes, used, to, reroute, and, switch, electrical, services, the, term, is, often, used, to, refer, to, circuit, breaker, panels, or, fuseboxes, local, codes, can, specify, physical, clearance, around, the, panels, squirrels, rats, and, other, rodents, may, gnaw, on, unprotected, wiring, causing, fire, and, shock, hazards, this, is, especially, true, of, pvc, insulated, telephone, and, computer, network, cables, several, techniques, have, been, developed, to, deter, these, pests, including, insulation, loaded, with, pepper, dust, the, first, interior, power, wiring, systems, used, conductors, that, were, bare, or, covered, with, cloth, which, were, secured, by, staples, to, the, framing, of, the, building, or, on, running, boards, where, conductors, went, through, walls, they, were, protected, with, cloth, tape, splices, were, done, similarly, to, telegraph, connections, and, soldered, for, security, underground, conductors, were, insulated, with, wrappings, of, cloth, tape, soaked, in, pitch, and, laid, in, wooden, troughs, which, were, then, buried, such, wiring, systems, were, unsatisfactory, because, of, the, danger, of, electrocution, and, fire, plus, the, high, labour, cost, for, such, installations, the, first, electrical, codes, arose, in, the, 1880s, with, the, commercial, introduction, of, electrical, power, however, many, conflicting, standards, existed, for, the, selection, of, wire, sizes, and, other, design, rules, for, electrical, installations, and, a, need, was, seen, to, introduce, uniformity, on, the, grounds, of, safety, the, earliest, standardized, method, of, wiring, in, buildings, in, common, use, in, north, america, from, about, 1880, to, the, 1930s, was, knob, and, tube, k, t, wiring, single, conductors, were, run, through, cavities, between, the, structural, members, in, walls, and, ceilings, with, ceramic, tubes, forming, protective, channels, through, joists, and, ceramic, knobs, attached, to, the, structural, members, to, provide, air, between, the, wire, and, the, lumber, and, to, support, the, wires, since, air, was, free, to, circulate, over, the, wires, smaller, conductors, could, be, used, than, required, in, cables, by, arranging, wires, on, opposite, sides, of, building, structural, members, some, protection, was, afforded, against, short, circuits, that, can, be, caused, by, driving, a, nail, into, both, conductors, simultaneously, by, the, 1940s, the, labor, cost, of, installing, two, conductors, rather, than, one, cable, resulted, in, a, decline, in, new, knob, and, tube, installations, however, the, us, code, still, allows, new, k, t, wiring, installations, in, special, situations, some, rural, and, industrial, applications, in, the, united, kingdom, an, early, form, of, insulated, cable, introduced, in, 1896, consisted, of, two, impregnated, paper, insulated, conductors, in, an, overall, lead, sheath, joints, were, soldered, and, special, fittings, were, used, for, lamp, holders, and, switches, these, cables, were, similar, to, underground, telegraph, and, telephone, cables, of, the, time, paper, insulated, cables, proved, unsuitable, for, interior, wiring, installations, because, very, careful, workmanship, was, required, on, the, lead, sheaths, to, ensure, moisture, did, not, affect, the, insulation, a, system, later, invented, in, the, uk, in, 1908, employed, vulcanised, rubber, insulated, wire, enclosed, in, a, strip, metal, sheath, the, metal, sheath, was, bonded, to, each, metal, wiring, device, to, ensure, earthing, continuity, a, system, developed, in, germany, called, kuhlo, wire, used, one, two, or, three, rubber, insulated, wires, in, a, brass, or, lead, coated, iron, sheet, tube, with, a, crimped, seam, the, enclosure, could, also, be, used, as, a, return, conductor, kuhlo, wire, could, be, run, exposed, on, surfaces, and, painted, or, embedded, in, plaster, special, outlet, and, junction, boxes, were, made, for, lamps, and, switches, made, either, of, porcelain, or, sheet, steel, the, crimped, seam, was, not, considered, as, watertight, as, the, stannos, wire, used, in, england, which, had, a, soldered, sheath, a, somewhat, similar, system, called, concentric, wiring, was, introduced, in, the, united, states, around, 1905, in, this, system, an, insulated, electrical, wire, was, wrapped, with, copper, tape, which, was, then, soldered, forming, the, grounded, return, conductor, of, the, wiring, system, the, bare, metal, sheath, at, earth, potential, was, considered, safe, to, touch, while, companies, such, as, general, electric, manufactured, fittings, for, the, system, and, a, few, buildings, were, wired, with, it, it, was, never, adopted, into, the, us, national, electrical, code, drawbacks, of, the, system, were, that, special, fittings, were, required, and, that, any, defect, in, the, connection, of, the, sheath, would, result, in, the, sheath, becoming, energised, armored, cables, with, two, rubber, insulated, conductors, in, a, flexible, metal, sheath, were, used, as, early, as, 1906, and, were, considered, at, the, time, a, better, method, than, open, knob, and, tube, wiring, although, much, more, expensive, the, first, rubber, insulated, cables, for, us, building, wiring, were, introduced, in, 1922, with, us, patent, 1458803, burley, harry, rooney, henry, insulated, electric, wire, issued, 1923, 06, 12, assigned, to, boston, insulated, wire, and, cable, these, were, two, or, more, solid, copper, electrical, wires, with, rubber, insulation, plus, woven, cotton, cloth, over, each, conductor, for, protection, of, the, insulation, with, an, overall, woven, jacket, usually, impregnated, with, tar, as, a, protection, from, moisture, waxed, paper, was, used, as, a, filler, and, separator, over, time, rubber, insulated, cables, become, brittle, because, of, exposure, to, atmospheric, oxygen, so, they, must, be, handled, with, care, and, are, usually, replaced, during, renovations, when, switches, socket, outlets, or, light, fixtures, are, replaced, the, mere, act, of, tightening, connections, may, cause, hardened, insulation, to, flake, off, the, conductors, rubber, insulation, further, inside, the, cable, often, is, in, better, condition, than, the, insulation, exposed, at, connections, due, to, reduced, exposure, to, oxygen, the, sulfur, in, vulcanized, rubber, insulation, attacked, bare, copper, wire, so, the, conductors, were, tinned, to, prevent, this, the, conductors, reverted, to, being, bare, when, rubber, ceased, to, be, used, about, 1950, pvc, insulation, and, jackets, were, introduced, especially, for, residential, wiring, about, the, same, time, single, conductors, with, a, thinner, pvc, insulation, and, a, thin, nylon, jacket, e, g, us, type, thn, thhn, etc, became, common, the, simplest, form, of, cable, has, two, insulated, conductors, twisted, together, to, form, a, unit, such, non, jacketed, cables, with, two, or, more, conductors, are, used, only, for, extra, low, voltage, signal, and, control, applications, such, as, doorbell, wiring, other, methods, of, securing, wiring, that, are, now, obsolete, include, metal, moulding, systems, with, a, flattened, oval, section, consisting, of, a, base, strip, and, a, snap, on, cap, channel, were, more, costly, than, open, wiring, or, wooden, moulding, but, could, be, easily, run, on, wall, surfaces, similar, surface, mounted, raceway, wiring, systems, are, still, available, today
