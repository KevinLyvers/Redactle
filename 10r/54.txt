https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel
in, digital, imaging, a, pixel, abbreviated, px, pel, or, picture, element, is, the, smallest, addressable, element, in, a, raster, image, or, the, smallest, addressable, element, in, a, dot, matrix, display, device, in, most, digital, display, devices, pixels, are, the, smallest, element, that, can, be, manipulated, through, software, each, pixel, is, a, sample, of, an, original, image, more, samples, typically, provide, more, accurate, representations, of, the, original, the, intensity, of, each, pixel, is, variable, in, color, imaging, systems, a, color, is, typically, represented, by, three, or, four, component, intensities, such, as, red, green, and, blue, or, cyan, magenta, yellow, and, black, in, some, contexts, such, as, descriptions, of, camera, sensors, pixel, refers, to, a, single, scalar, element, of, a, multi, component, representation, called, a, photosite, in, the, camera, sensor, context, although, sensel, sensor, element, is, sometimes, used, while, in, yet, other, contexts, like, mri, it, may, refer, to, a, set, of, component, intensities, for, a, spatial, position, software, on, early, consumer, computers, was, necessarily, rendered, at, a, low, resolution, with, large, pixels, visible, to, the, naked, eye, graphics, made, under, these, limitations, may, be, called, pixel, art, especially, in, reference, to, video, games, modern, computers, and, displays, however, can, easily, render, orders, of, magnitude, more, pixels, than, was, previously, possible, necessitating, the, use, of, large, measurements, like, the, megapixel, one, million, pixels, the, word, pixel, is, a, combination, of, pix, from, pictures, shortened, to, pics, and, el, for, element, similar, formations, with, el, include, the, words, voxel, volume, pixel, and, texel, texture, pixel, the, word, pix, appeared, in, variety, magazine, headlines, in, 1932, as, an, abbreviation, for, the, word, pictures, in, reference, to, movies, by, 1938, pix, was, being, used, in, reference, to, still, pictures, by, photojournalists, the, word, pixel, was, first, published, in, 1965, by, frederic, c, billingsley, of, jpl, to, describe, the, picture, elements, of, scanned, images, from, space, probes, to, the, moon, and, mars, billingsley, had, learned, the, word, from, keith, e, mcfarland, at, the, link, division, of, general, precision, in, palo, alto, who, in, turn, said, he, did, not, know, where, it, originated, mcfarland, said, simply, it, was, in, use, at, the, time, c, 1963, the, concept, of, a, picture, element, dates, to, the, earliest, days, of, television, for, example, as, bildpunkt, the, german, word, for, pixel, literally, picture, point, in, the, 1888, german, patent, of, paul, nipkow, according, to, various, etymologies, the, earliest, publication, of, the, term, picture, element, itself, was, in, wireless, world, magazine, in, 1927, though, it, had, been, used, earlier, in, various, u, s, patents, filed, as, early, as, 1911, some, authors, explain, pixel, as, picture, cell, as, early, as, 1972, in, graphics, and, in, image, and, video, processing, pel, is, often, used, instead, of, pixel, for, example, ibm, used, it, in, their, technical, reference, for, the, original, pc, pixilation, spelled, with, a, second, i, is, an, unrelated, filmmaking, technique, that, dates, to, the, beginnings, of, cinema, in, which, live, actors, are, posed, frame, by, frame, and, photographed, to, create, stop, motion, animation, an, archaic, british, word, meaning, possession, by, spirits, pixies, the, term, has, been, used, to, describe, the, animation, process, since, the, early, 1950s, various, animators, including, norman, mclaren, and, grant, munro, are, credited, with, popularizing, it, a, pixel, is, generally, thought, of, as, the, smallest, single, component, of, a, digital, image, however, the, definition, is, highly, context, sensitive, for, example, there, can, be, printed, pixels, in, a, page, or, pixels, carried, by, electronic, signals, or, represented, by, digital, values, or, pixels, on, a, display, device, or, pixels, in, a, digital, camera, photosensor, elements, this, list, is, not, exhaustive, and, depending, on, context, synonyms, include, pel, sample, byte, bit, dot, and, spot, pixels, can, be, used, as, a, unit, of, measure, such, as, 2400, pixels, per, inch, 640, pixels, per, line, or, spaced, 10, pixels, apart, the, measures, dots, per, inch, dpi, and, pixels, per, inch, ppi, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, but, have, distinct, meanings, especially, for, printer, devices, where, dpi, is, a, measure, of, the, printer, s, density, of, dot, e, g, ink, droplet, placement, for, example, a, high, quality, photographic, image, may, be, printed, with, 600, ppi, on, a, 1200, dpi, inkjet, printer, even, higher, dpi, numbers, such, as, the, 4800, dpi, quoted, by, printer, manufacturers, since, 2002, do, not, mean, much, in, terms, of, achievable, resolution, the, more, pixels, used, to, represent, an, image, the, closer, the, result, can, resemble, the, original, the, number, of, pixels, in, an, image, is, sometimes, called, the, resolution, though, resolution, has, a, more, specific, definition, pixel, counts, can, be, expressed, as, a, single, number, as, in, a, three, megapixel, digital, camera, which, has, a, nominal, three, million, pixels, or, as, a, pair, of, numbers, as, in, a, 640, by, 480, display, which, has, 640, pixels, from, side, to, side, and, 480, from, top, to, bottom, as, in, a, vga, display, and, therefore, has, a, total, number, of, 640, 480, 307, 200, pixels, or, 0, 3, megapixels, the, pixels, or, color, samples, that, form, a, digitized, image, such, as, a, jpeg, file, used, on, a, web, page, may, or, may, not, be, in, one, to, one, correspondence, with, screen, pixels, depending, on, how, a, computer, displays, an, image, in, computing, an, image, composed, of, pixels, is, known, as, a, bitmapped, image, or, a, raster, image, the, word, raster, originates, from, television, scanning, patterns, and, has, been, widely, used, to, describe, similar, halftone, printing, and, storage, techniques, for, convenience, pixels, are, normally, arranged, in, a, regular, two, dimensional, grid, by, using, this, arrangement, many, common, operations, can, be, implemented, by, uniformly, applying, the, same, operation, to, each, pixel, independently, other, arrangements, of, pixels, are, possible, with, some, sampling, patterns, even, changing, the, shape, or, kernel, of, each, pixel, across, the, image, for, this, reason, care, must, be, taken, when, acquiring, an, image, on, one, device, and, displaying, it, on, another, or, when, converting, image, data, from, one, pixel, format, to, another, for, example, computers, can, use, pixels, to, display, an, image, often, an, abstract, image, that, represents, a, gui, the, resolution, of, this, image, is, called, the, display, resolution, and, is, determined, by, the, video, card, of, the, computer, lcd, monitors, also, use, pixels, to, display, an, image, and, have, a, native, resolution, each, pixel, is, made, up, of, triads, with, the, number, of, these, triads, determining, the, native, resolution, on, some, crt, monitors, the, beam, sweep, rate, may, be, fixed, resulting, in, a, fixed, native, resolution, most, crt, monitors, do, not, have, a, fixed, beam, sweep, rate, meaning, they, do, not, have, a, native, resolution, at, all, instead, they, have, a, set, of, resolutions, that, are, equally, well, supported, to, produce, the, sharpest, images, possible, on, an, lcd, the, user, must, ensure, the, display, resolution, of, the, computer, matches, the, native, resolution, of, the, monitor, the, pixel, scale, used, in, astronomy, is, the, angular, distance, between, two, objects, on, the, sky, that, fall, one, pixel, apart, on, the, detector, ccd, or, infrared, chip, the, scale, s, measured, in, radians, is, the, ratio, of, the, pixel, spacing, p, and, focal, length, f, of, the, preceding, optics, s, p, f, the, focal, length, is, the, product, of, the, focal, ratio, by, the, diameter, of, the, associated, lens, or, mirror, because, s, is, usually, expressed, in, units, of, arcseconds, per, pixel, because, 1, radian, equals, 180, 3600, 206, 265, arcseconds, and, because, focal, lengths, are, often, given, in, millimeters, and, pixel, sizes, in, micrometers, which, yields, another, factor, of, 1, 000, the, formula, is, often, quoted, as, s, 206, p, f, the, number, of, distinct, colors, that, can, be, represented, by, a, pixel, depends, on, the, number, of, bits, per, pixel, bpp, a, 1, bpp, image, uses, 1, bit, for, each, pixel, so, each, pixel, can, be, either, on, or, off, each, additional, bit, doubles, the, number, of, colors, available, so, a, 2, bpp, image, can, have, 4, colors, and, a, 3, bpp, image, can, have, 8, colors, for, color, depths, of, 15, or, more, bits, per, pixel, the, depth, is, normally, the, sum, of, the, bits, allocated, to, each, of, the, red, green, and, blue, components, highcolor, usually, meaning, 16, bpp, normally, has, five, bits, for, red, and, blue, each, and, six, bits, for, green, as, the, human, eye, is, more, sensitive, to, errors, in, green, than, in, the, other, two, primary, colors, for, applications, involving, transparency, the, 16, bits, may, be, divided, into, five, bits, each, of, red, green, and, blue, with, one, bit, left, for, transparency, a, 24, bit, depth, allows, 8, bits, per, component, on, some, systems, 32, bit, depth, is, available, this, means, that, each, 24, bit, pixel, has, an, extra, 8, bits, to, describe, its, opacity, for, purposes, of, combining, with, another, image, many, display, and, image, acquisition, systems, are, not, capable, of, displaying, or, sensing, the, different, color, channels, at, the, same, site, therefore, the, pixel, grid, is, divided, into, single, color, regions, that, contribute, to, the, displayed, or, sensed, color, when, viewed, at, a, distance, in, some, displays, such, as, lcd, led, and, plasma, displays, these, single, color, regions, are, separately, addressable, elements, which, have, come, to, be, known, as, subpixels, mostly, rgb, colors, for, example, lcds, typically, divide, each, pixel, vertically, into, three, subpixels, when, the, square, pixel, is, divided, into, three, subpixels, each, subpixel, is, necessarily, rectangular, in, display, industry, terminology, subpixels, are, often, referred, to, as, pixels, as, they, are, the, basic, addressable, elements, in, a, viewpoint, of, hardware, and, hence, pixel, circuits, rather, than, subpixel, circuits, is, used, most, digital, camera, image, sensors, use, single, color, sensor, regions, for, example, using, the, bayer, filter, pattern, and, in, the, camera, industry, these, are, known, as, pixels, just, like, in, the, display, industry, not, subpixels, for, systems, with, subpixels, two, different, approaches, can, be, taken, this, latter, approach, referred, to, as, subpixel, rendering, uses, knowledge, of, pixel, geometry, to, manipulate, the, three, colored, subpixels, separately, producing, an, increase, in, the, apparent, resolution, of, color, displays, while, crt, displays, use, red, green, blue, masked, phosphor, areas, dictated, by, a, mesh, grid, called, the, shadow, mask, it, would, require, a, difficult, calibration, step, to, be, aligned, with, the, displayed, pixel, raster, and, so, crts, do, not, use, subpixel, rendering, the, concept, of, subpixels, is, related, to, samples, in, graphic, web, design, and, user, interfaces, a, pixel, may, refer, to, a, fixed, length, rather, than, a, true, pixel, on, the, screen, to, accommodate, different, pixel, densities, a, typical, definition, such, as, in, css, is, that, a, physical, pixel, is, 1, 96, inch, 0, 26, mm, doing, so, makes, sure, a, given, element, will, display, as, the, same, size, no, matter, what, screen, resolution, views, it, there, may, however, be, some, further, adjustments, between, a, physical, pixel, and, an, on, screen, logical, pixel, as, screens, are, viewed, at, difference, distances, consider, a, phone, a, computer, display, and, a, tv, the, desired, length, a, reference, pixel, is, scaled, relative, to, a, reference, viewing, distance, 28, inches, 71, cm, in, css, in, addition, as, true, screen, pixel, densities, are, rarely, multiples, of, 96, dpi, some, rounding, is, often, applied, so, that, a, logical, pixel, is, an, integer, amount, of, actual, pixels, doing, so, avoids, render, artifacts, the, final, pixel, obtained, after, these, two, steps, becomes, the, anchor, to, which, all, other, absolute, measurements, e, g, the, centimeter, are, based, on, worked, example, with, a, 30, inch, 76, cm, 2160p, tv, placed, 56, inches, 140, cm, away, from, the, viewer, a, browser, will, then, choose, to, use, the, 1, 721, pixel, size, or, round, to, a, 2, ratio, a, megapixel, mp, is, a, million, pixels, the, term, is, used, not, only, for, the, number, of, pixels, in, an, image, but, also, to, express, the, number, of, image, sensor, elements, of, digital, cameras, or, the, number, of, display, elements, of, digital, displays, for, example, a, camera, that, makes, a, 2048, 1536, pixel, image, 3, 145, 728, finished, image, pixels, typically, uses, a, few, extra, rows, and, columns, of, sensor, elements, and, is, commonly, said, to, have, 3, 2, megapixels, or, 3, 4, megapixels, depending, on, whether, the, number, reported, is, the, effective, or, the, total, pixel, count, pixel, is, used, to, define, the, resolution, of, a, photo, photo, resolution, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, width, and, height, of, a, sensor, in, pixels, digital, cameras, use, photosensitive, electronics, either, charge, coupled, device, ccd, or, complementary, metal, oxide, semiconductor, cmos, image, sensors, consisting, of, a, large, number, of, single, sensor, elements, each, of, which, records, a, measured, intensity, level, in, most, digital, cameras, the, sensor, array, is, covered, with, a, patterned, color, filter, mosaic, having, red, green, and, blue, regions, in, the, bayer, filter, arrangement, so, that, each, sensor, element, can, record, the, intensity, of, a, single, primary, color, of, light, the, camera, interpolates, the, color, information, of, neighboring, sensor, elements, through, a, process, called, demosaicing, to, create, the, final, image, these, sensor, elements, are, often, called, pixels, even, though, they, only, record, one, channel, only, red, or, green, or, blue, of, the, final, color, image, thus, two, of, the, three, color, channels, for, each, sensor, must, be, interpolated, and, a, so, called, n, megapixel, camera, that, produces, an, n, megapixel, image, provides, only, one, third, of, the, information, that, an, image, of, the, same, size, could, get, from, a, scanner, thus, certain, color, contrasts, may, look, fuzzier, than, others, depending, on, the, allocation, of, the, primary, colors, green, has, twice, as, many, elements, as, red, or, blue, in, the, bayer, arrangement, dxo, labs, invented, the, perceptual, megapixel, p, mpix, to, measure, the, sharpness, that, a, camera, produces, when, paired, to, a, particular, lens, as, opposed, to, the, mp, a, manufacturer, states, for, a, camera, product, which, is, based, only, on, the, camera, s, sensor, the, new, p, mpix, claims, to, be, a, more, accurate, and, relevant, value, for, photographers, to, consider, when, weighing, up, camera, sharpness, as, of, mid, 2013, the, sigma, 35, mm, f, 1, 4, dg, hsm, lens, mounted, on, a, nikon, d800, has, the, highest, measured, p, mpix, however, with, a, value, of, 23, mp, it, still, wipes, off, more, than, one, third, of, the, d800, s, 36, 3, mp, sensor, in, august, 2019, xiaomi, released, the, redmi, note, 8, pro, as, the, world, s, first, smartphone, with, 64, mp, camera, on, december, 12, 2019, samsung, released, samsung, a71, that, also, has, a, 64, mp, camera, in, late, 2019, xiaomi, announced, the, first, camera, phone, with, 108, mp, 1, 1, 33, inch, across, sensor, the, sensor, is, larger, than, most, of, bridge, camera, with, 1, 2, 3, inch, across, sensor, one, new, method, to, add, megapixels, has, been, introduced, in, a, micro, four, thirds, system, camera, which, only, uses, a, 16, mp, sensor, but, can, produce, a, 64, mp, raw, 40, mp, jpeg, image, by, making, two, exposures, shifting, the, sensor, by, a, half, pixel, between, them, using, a, tripod, to, take, level, multi, shots, within, an, instance, the, multiple, 16, mp, images, are, then, generated, into, a, unified, 64, mp, image
