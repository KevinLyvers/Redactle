medical, imaging, is, the, technique, and, process, of, imaging, the, interior, of, a, body, for, clinical, analysis, and, medical, intervention, as, well, as, visual, representation, of, the, function, of, some, organs, or, tissues, physiology, medical, imaging, seeks, to, reveal, internal, structures, hidden, by, the, skin, and, bones, as, well, as, to, diagnose, and, treat, disease, medical, imaging, also, establishes, a, database, of, normal, anatomy, and, physiology, to, make, it, possible, to, identify, abnormalities, although, imaging, of, removed, organs, and, tissues, can, be, performed, for, medical, reasons, such, procedures, are, usually, considered, part, of, pathology, instead, of, medical, imaging, measurement, and, recording, techniques, that, are, not, primarily, designed, to, produce, images, such, as, electroencephalography, eeg, magnetoencephalography, meg, electrocardiography, ecg, and, others, represent, other, technologies, that, produce, data, susceptible, to, representation, as, a, parameter, graph, versus, time, or, maps, that, contain, data, about, the, measurement, locations, in, a, limited, comparison, these, technologies, can, be, considered, forms, of, medical, imaging, in, another, discipline, of, medical, instrumentation, as, of, 2010, 5, billion, medical, imaging, studies, had, been, conducted, worldwide, radiation, exposure, from, medical, imaging, in, 2006, made, up, about, 50, of, total, ionizing, radiation, exposure, in, the, united, states, medical, imaging, equipment, is, manufactured, using, technology, from, the, semiconductor, industry, including, cmos, integrated, circuit, chips, power, semiconductor, devices, sensors, such, as, image, sensors, particularly, cmos, sensors, and, biosensors, and, processors, such, as, microcontrollers, microprocessors, digital, signal, processors, media, processors, and, system, on, chip, devices, as, of, 2015, annual, shipments, of, medical, imaging, chips, amount, to, 46, million, units, and, 1, 1, billion, the, term, noninvasive, is, used, to, denote, a, procedure, where, no, instrument, is, introduced, into, a, patient, s, body, which, is, the, case, for, most, imaging, techniques, used, in, the, clinical, context, invisible, light, medical, imaging, is, generally, equated, to, radiology, or, clinical, imaging, visible, light, medical, imaging, involves, digital, video, or, still, pictures, that, can, be, seen, without, special, equipment, dermatology, and, wound, care, are, two, modalities, that, use, visible, light, imagery, interpretation, of, medical, images, is, generally, undertaken, by, a, physician, specialising, in, radiology, known, as, a, radiologist, however, this, may, be, undertaken, by, any, healthcare, professional, who, is, trained, and, certified, in, radiological, clinical, evaluation, increasingly, interpretation, is, being, undertaken, by, non, physicians, for, example, radiographers, frequently, train, in, interpretation, as, part, of, expanded, practice, diagnostic, radiography, designates, the, technical, aspects, of, medical, imaging, and, in, particular, the, acquisition, of, medical, images, the, radiographer, also, known, as, a, radiologic, technologist, is, usually, responsible, for, acquiring, medical, images, of, diagnostic, quality, although, other, professionals, may, train, in, this, area, notably, some, radiological, interventions, performed, by, radiologists, are, done, so, without, a, radiographer, as, a, field, of, scientific, investigation, medical, imaging, constitutes, a, sub, discipline, of, biomedical, engineering, medical, physics, or, medicine, depending, on, the, context, research, and, development, in, the, area, of, instrumentation, image, acquisition, e, g, radiography, modeling, and, quantification, are, usually, the, preserve, of, biomedical, engineering, medical, physics, and, computer, science, research, into, the, application, and, interpretation, of, medical, images, is, usually, the, preserve, of, radiology, and, the, medical, sub, discipline, relevant, to, medical, condition, or, area, of, medical, science, neuroscience, cardiology, psychiatry, psychology, etc, under, investigation, many, of, the, techniques, developed, for, medical, imaging, also, have, scientific, and, industrial, applications, two, forms, of, radiographic, images, are, in, use, in, medical, imaging, projection, radiography, and, fluoroscopy, with, the, latter, being, useful, for, catheter, guidance, these, 2d, techniques, are, still, in, wide, use, despite, the, advance, of, 3d, tomography, due, to, the, low, cost, high, resolution, and, depending, on, the, application, lower, radiation, dosages, with, 2d, technique, this, imaging, modality, uses, a, wide, beam, of, x, rays, for, image, acquisition, and, is, the, first, imaging, technique, available, in, modern, medicine, a, magnetic, resonance, imaging, instrument, mri, scanner, or, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, imaging, scanner, as, it, was, originally, known, uses, powerful, magnets, to, polarize, and, excite, hydrogen, nuclei, i, e, single, protons, of, water, molecules, in, human, tissue, producing, a, detectable, signal, which, is, spatially, encoded, resulting, in, images, of, the, body, the, mri, machine, emits, a, radio, frequency, rf, pulse, at, the, resonant, frequency, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, on, water, molecules, radio, frequency, antennas, rf, coils, send, the, pulse, to, the, area, of, the, body, to, be, examined, the, rf, pulse, is, absorbed, by, protons, causing, their, direction, with, respect, to, the, primary, magnetic, field, to, change, when, the, rf, pulse, is, turned, off, the, protons, relax, back, to, alignment, with, the, primary, magnet, and, emit, radio, waves, in, the, process, this, radio, frequency, emission, from, the, hydrogen, atoms, on, water, is, what, is, detected, and, reconstructed, into, an, image, the, resonant, frequency, of, a, spinning, magnetic, dipole, of, which, protons, are, one, example, is, called, the, larmor, frequency, and, is, determined, by, the, strength, of, the, main, magnetic, field, and, the, chemical, environment, of, the, nuclei, of, interest, mri, uses, three, electromagnetic, fields, a, very, strong, typically, 1, 5, to, 3, teslas, static, magnetic, field, to, polarize, the, hydrogen, nuclei, called, the, primary, field, gradient, fields, that, can, be, modified, to, vary, in, space, and, time, on, the, order, of, 1, khz, for, spatial, encoding, often, simply, called, gradients, and, a, spatially, homogeneous, radio, frequency, rf, field, for, manipulation, of, the, hydrogen, nuclei, to, produce, measurable, signals, collected, through, an, rf, antenna, like, ct, mri, traditionally, creates, a, two, dimensional, image, of, a, thin, slice, of, the, body, and, is, therefore, considered, a, tomographic, imaging, technique, modern, mri, instruments, are, capable, of, producing, images, in, the, form, of, 3d, blocks, which, may, be, considered, a, generalization, of, the, single, slice, tomographic, concept, unlike, ct, mri, does, not, involve, the, use, of, ionizing, radiation, and, is, therefore, not, associated, with, the, same, health, hazards, for, example, because, mri, has, only, been, in, use, since, the, early, 1980s, there, are, no, known, long, term, effects, of, exposure, to, strong, static, fields, this, is, the, subject, of, some, debate, see, safety, in, mri, and, therefore, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, scans, to, which, an, individual, can, be, subjected, in, contrast, with, x, ray, and, ct, however, there, are, well, identified, health, risks, associated, with, tissue, heating, from, exposure, to, the, rf, field, and, the, presence, of, implanted, devices, in, the, body, such, as, pacemakers, these, risks, are, strictly, controlled, as, part, of, the, design, of, the, instrument, and, the, scanning, protocols, used, because, ct, and, mri, are, sensitive, to, different, tissue, properties, the, appearances, of, the, images, obtained, with, the, two, techniques, differ, markedly, in, ct, x, rays, must, be, blocked, by, some, form, of, dense, tissue, to, create, an, image, so, the, image, quality, when, looking, at, soft, tissues, will, be, poor, in, mri, while, any, nucleus, with, a, net, nuclear, spin, can, be, used, the, proton, of, the, hydrogen, atom, remains, the, most, widely, used, especially, in, the, clinical, setting, because, it, is, so, ubiquitous, and, returns, a, large, signal, this, nucleus, present, in, water, molecules, allows, the, excellent, soft, tissue, contrast, achievable, with, mri, a, number, of, different, pulse, sequences, can, be, used, for, specific, mri, diagnostic, imaging, multiparametric, mri, or, mpmri, it, is, possible, to, differentiate, tissue, characteristics, by, combining, two, or, more, of, the, following, imaging, sequences, depending, on, the, information, being, sought, t1, weighted, t1, mri, t2, weighted, t2, mri, diffusion, weighted, imaging, dwi, mri, dynamic, contrast, enhancement, dce, mri, and, spectroscopy, mri, s, for, example, imaging, of, prostate, tumors, is, better, accomplished, using, t2, mri, and, dwi, mri, than, t2, weighted, imaging, alone, the, number, of, applications, of, mpmri, for, detecting, disease, in, various, organs, continues, to, expand, including, liver, studies, breast, tumors, pancreatic, tumors, and, assessing, the, effects, of, vascular, disruption, agents, on, cancer, tumors, nuclear, medicine, encompasses, both, diagnostic, imaging, and, treatment, of, disease, and, may, also, be, referred, to, as, molecular, medicine, or, molecular, imaging, and, therapeutics, nuclear, medicine, uses, certain, properties, of, isotopes, and, the, energetic, particles, emitted, from, radioactive, material, to, diagnose, or, treat, various, pathology, different, from, the, typical, concept, of, anatomic, radiology, nuclear, medicine, enables, assessment, of, physiology, this, function, based, approach, to, medical, evaluation, has, useful, applications, in, most, subspecialties, notably, oncology, neurology, and, cardiology, gamma, cameras, and, pet, scanners, are, used, in, e, g, scintigraphy, spect, and, pet, to, detect, regions, of, biologic, activity, that, may, be, associated, with, a, disease, relatively, short, lived, isotope, such, as, 99m, tc, is, administered, to, the, patient, isotopes, are, often, preferentially, absorbed, by, biologically, active, tissue, in, the, body, and, can, be, used, to, identify, tumors, or, fracture, points, in, bone, images, are, acquired, after, collimated, photons, are, detected, by, a, crystal, that, gives, off, a, light, signal, which, is, in, turn, amplified, and, converted, into, count, data, fiduciary, markers, are, used, in, a, wide, range, of, medical, imaging, applications, images, of, the, same, subject, produced, with, two, different, imaging, systems, may, be, correlated, called, image, registration, by, placing, a, fiduciary, marker, in, the, area, imaged, by, both, systems, in, this, case, a, marker, which, is, visible, in, the, images, produced, by, both, imaging, modalities, must, be, used, by, this, method, functional, information, from, spect, or, positron, emission, tomography, can, be, related, to, anatomical, information, provided, by, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, similarly, fiducial, points, established, during, mri, can, be, correlated, with, brain, images, generated, by, magnetoencephalography, to, localize, the, source, of, brain, activity, medical, ultrasound, uses, high, frequency, broadband, sound, waves, in, the, megahertz, range, that, are, reflected, by, tissue, to, varying, degrees, to, produce, up, to, 3d, images, this, is, commonly, associated, with, imaging, the, fetus, in, pregnant, women, uses, of, ultrasound, are, much, broader, however, other, important, uses, include, imaging, the, abdominal, organs, heart, breast, muscles, tendons, arteries, and, veins, while, it, may, provide, less, anatomical, detail, than, techniques, such, as, ct, or, mri, it, has, several, advantages, which, make, it, ideal, in, numerous, situations, in, particular, that, it, studies, the, function, of, moving, structures, in, real, time, emits, no, ionizing, radiation, and, contains, speckle, that, can, be, used, in, elastography, ultrasound, is, also, used, as, a, popular, research, tool, for, capturing, raw, data, that, can, be, made, available, through, an, ultrasound, research, interface, for, the, purpose, of, tissue, characterization, and, implementation, of, new, image, processing, techniques, the, concepts, of, ultrasound, differ, from, other, medical, imaging, modalities, in, the, fact, that, it, is, operated, by, the, transmission, and, receipt, of, sound, waves, the, high, frequency, sound, waves, are, sent, into, the, tissue, and, depending, on, the, composition, of, the, different, tissues, the, signal, will, be, attenuated, and, returned, at, separate, intervals, a, path, of, reflected, sound, waves, in, a, multilayered, structure, can, be, defined, by, an, input, acoustic, impedance, ultrasound, sound, wave, and, the, reflection, and, transmission, coefficients, of, the, relative, structures, it, is, very, safe, to, use, and, does, not, appear, to, cause, any, adverse, effects, it, is, also, relatively, inexpensive, and, quick, to, perform, ultrasound, scanners, can, be, taken, to, critically, ill, patients, in, intensive, care, units, avoiding, the, danger, caused, while, moving, the, patient, to, the, radiology, department, the, real, time, moving, image, obtained, can, be, used, to, guide, drainage, and, biopsy, procedures, doppler, capabilities, on, modern, scanners, allow, the, blood, flow, in, arteries, and, veins, to, be, assessed, elastography, is, a, relatively, new, imaging, modality, that, maps, the, elastic, properties, of, soft, tissue, this, modality, emerged, in, the, last, two, decades, elastography, is, useful, in, medical, diagnoses, as, elasticity, can, discern, healthy, from, unhealthy, tissue, for, specific, organs, growths, for, example, cancerous, tumours, will, often, be, harder, than, the, surrounding, tissue, and, diseased, livers, are, stiffer, than, healthy, ones, there, are, several, elastographic, techniques, based, on, the, use, of, ultrasound, magnetic, resonance, imaging, and, tactile, imaging, the, wide, clinical, use, of, ultrasound, elastography, is, a, result, of, the, implementation, of, technology, in, clinical, ultrasound, machines, main, branches, of, ultrasound, elastography, include, quasistatic, elastography, strain, imaging, shear, wave, elasticity, imaging, swei, acoustic, radiation, force, impulse, imaging, arfi, supersonic, shear, imaging, ssi, and, transient, elastography, in, the, last, decade, a, steady, increase, of, activities, in, the, field, of, elastography, is, observed, demonstrating, successful, application, of, the, technology, in, various, areas, of, medical, diagnostics, and, treatment, monitoring, photoacoustic, imaging, is, a, recently, developed, hybrid, biomedical, imaging, modality, based, on, the, photoacoustic, effect, it, combines, the, advantages, of, optical, absorption, contrast, with, an, ultrasonic, spatial, resolution, for, deep, imaging, in, optical, diffusive, or, quasi, diffusive, regime, recent, studies, have, shown, that, photoacoustic, imaging, can, be, used, in, vivo, for, tumor, angiogenesis, monitoring, blood, oxygenation, mapping, functional, brain, imaging, and, skin, melanoma, detection, etc, tomography, is, the, imaging, by, sections, or, sectioning, the, main, such, methods, in, medical, imaging, are, when, ultrasound, is, used, to, image, the, heart, it, is, referred, to, as, an, echocardiogram, echocardiography, allows, detailed, structures, of, the, heart, including, chamber, size, heart, function, the, valves, of, the, heart, as, well, as, the, pericardium, the, sac, around, the, heart, to, be, seen, echocardiography, uses, 2d, 3d, and, doppler, imaging, to, create, pictures, of, the, heart, and, visualize, the, blood, flowing, through, each, of, the, four, heart, valves, echocardiography, is, widely, used, in, an, array, of, patients, ranging, from, those, experiencing, symptoms, such, as, shortness, of, breath, or, chest, pain, to, those, undergoing, cancer, treatments, transthoracic, ultrasound, has, been, proven, to, be, safe, for, patients, of, all, ages, from, infants, to, the, elderly, without, risk, of, harmful, side, effects, or, radiation, differentiating, it, from, other, imaging, modalities, echocardiography, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, imaging, modalities, in, the, world, due, to, its, portability, and, use, in, a, variety, of, applications, in, emergency, situations, echocardiography, is, quick, easily, accessible, and, able, to, be, performed, at, the, bedside, making, it, the, modality, of, choice, for, many, physicians, fnir, is, a, relatively, new, non, invasive, imaging, technique, nirs, near, infrared, spectroscopy, is, used, for, the, purpose, of, functional, neuroimaging, and, has, been, widely, accepted, as, a, brain, imaging, technique, using, superparamagnetic, iron, oxide, nanoparticles, magnetic, particle, imaging, mpi, is, a, developing, diagnostic, imaging, technique, used, for, tracking, superparamagnetic, iron, oxide, nanoparticles, the, primary, advantage, is, the, high, sensitivity, and, specificity, along, with, the, lack, of, signal, decrease, with, tissue, depth, mpi, has, been, used, in, medical, research, to, image, cardiovascular, performance, neuroperfusion, and, cell, tracking, medical, imaging, may, be, indicated, in, pregnancy, because, of, pregnancy, complications, a, pre, existing, disease, or, an, acquired, disease, in, pregnancy, or, routine, prenatal, care, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, without, mri, contrast, agents, as, well, as, obstetric, ultrasonography, are, not, associated, with, any, risk, for, the, mother, or, the, fetus, and, are, the, imaging, techniques, of, choice, for, pregnant, women, projectional, radiography, ct, scan, and, nuclear, medicine, imaging, result, some, degree, of, ionizing, radiation, exposure, but, have, with, a, few, exceptions, much, lower, absorbed, doses, than, what, are, associated, with, fetal, harm, at, higher, dosages, effects, can, include, miscarriage, birth, defects, and, intellectual, disability, the, amount, of, data, obtained, in, a, single, mr, or, ct, scan, is, very, extensive, some, of, the, data, that, radiologists, discard, could, save, patients, time, and, money, while, reducing, their, exposure, to, radiation, and, risk, of, complications, from, invasive, procedures, another, approach, for, making, the, procedures, more, efficient, is, based, on, utilizing, additional, constraints, e, g, in, some, medical, imaging, modalities, one, can, improve, the, efficiency, of, the, data, acquisition, by, taking, into, account, the, fact, the, reconstructed, density, is, positive, volume, rendering, techniques, have, been, developed, to, enable, ct, mri, and, ultrasound, scanning, software, to, produce, 3d, images, for, the, physician, traditionally, ct, and, mri, scans, produced, 2d, static, output, on, film, to, produce, 3d, images, many, scans, are, made, and, then, combined, by, computers, to, produce, a, 3d, model, which, can, then, be, manipulated, by, the, physician, 3d, ultrasounds, are, produced, using, a, somewhat, similar, technique, in, diagnosing, disease, of, the, viscera, of, the, abdomen, ultrasound, is, particularly, sensitive, on, imaging, of, biliary, tract, urinary, tract, and, female, reproductive, organs, ovary, fallopian, tubes, as, for, example, diagnosis, of, gallstone, by, dilatation, of, common, bile, duct, and, stone, in, the, common, bile, duct, with, the, ability, to, visualize, important, structures, in, great, detail, 3d, visualization, methods, are, a, valuable, resource, for, the, diagnosis, and, surgical, treatment, of, many, pathologies, it, was, a, key, resource, for, the, famous, but, ultimately, unsuccessful, attempt, by, singaporean, surgeons, to, separate, iranian, twins, ladan, and, laleh, bijani, in, 2003, the, 3d, equipment, was, used, previously, for, similar, operations, with, great, success, other, proposed, or, developed, techniques, include, some, of, these, techniques, are, still, at, a, research, stage, and, not, yet, used, in, clinical, routines, neuroimaging, has, also, been, used, in, experimental, circumstances, to, allow, people, especially, disabled, persons, to, control, outside, devices, acting, as, a, brain, computer, interface, many, medical, imaging, software, applications, are, used, for, non, diagnostic, imaging, specifically, because, they, do, not, have, an, fda, approval, and, not, allowed, to, use, in, clinical, research, for, patient, diagnosis, note, that, many, clinical, research, studies, are, not, designed, for, patient, diagnosis, anyway, used, primarily, in, ultrasound, imaging, capturing, the, image, produced, by, a, medical, imaging, device, is, required, for, archiving, and, telemedicine, applications, in, most, scenarios, a, frame, grabber, is, used, in, order, to, capture, the, video, signal, from, the, medical, device, and, relay, it, to, a, computer, for, further, processing, and, operations, the, digital, imaging, and, communication, in, medicine, dicom, standard, is, used, globally, to, store, exchange, and, transmit, medical, images, the, dicom, standard, incorporates, protocols, for, imaging, techniques, such, as, radiography, computed, tomography, ct, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, ultrasound, and, radiation, therapy, medical, imaging, techniques, produce, very, large, amounts, of, data, especially, from, ct, mri, and, pet, modalities, as, a, result, storage, and, communications, of, electronic, image, data, are, prohibitive, without, the, use, of, compression, jpeg, 2000, image, compression, is, used, by, the, dicom, standard, for, storage, and, transmission, of, medical, images, the, cost, and, feasibility, of, accessing, large, image, data, sets, over, low, or, various, bandwidths, are, further, addressed, by, use, of, another, dicom, standard, called, jpip, to, enable, efficient, streaming, of, the, jpeg, 2000, compressed, image, data, there, has, been, growing, trend, to, migrate, from, on, premise, pacs, to, a, cloud, based, pacs, a, recent, article, by, applied, radiology, said, as, the, digital, imaging, realm, is, embraced, across, the, healthcare, enterprise, the, swift, transition, from, terabytes, to, petabytes, of, data, has, put, radiology, on, the, brink, of, information, overload, cloud, computing, offers, the, imaging, department, of, the, future, the, tools, to, manage, data, much, more, intelligently, medical, imaging, has, become, a, major, tool, in, clinical, trials, since, it, enables, rapid, diagnosis, with, visualization, and, quantitative, assessment, a, typical, clinical, trial, goes, through, multiple, phases, and, can, take, up, to, eight, years, clinical, endpoints, or, outcomes, are, used, to, determine, whether, the, therapy, is, safe, and, effective, once, a, patient, reaches, the, endpoint, he, or, she, is, generally, excluded, from, further, experimental, interaction, trials, that, rely, solely, on, clinical, endpoints, are, very, costly, as, they, have, long, durations, and, tend, to, need, large, numbers, of, patients, in, contrast, to, clinical, endpoints, surrogate, endpoints, have, been, shown, to, cut, down, the, time, required, to, confirm, whether, a, drug, has, clinical, benefits, imaging, biomarkers, a, characteristic, that, is, objectively, measured, by, an, imaging, technique, which, is, used, as, an, indicator, of, pharmacological, response, to, a, therapy, and, surrogate, endpoints, have, shown, to, facilitate, the, use, of, small, group, sizes, obtaining, quick, results, with, good, statistical, power, imaging, is, able, to, reveal, subtle, change, that, is, indicative, of, the, progression, of, therapy, that, may, be, missed, out, by, more, subjective, traditional, approaches, statistical, bias, is, reduced, as, the, findings, are, evaluated, without, any, direct, patient, contact, imaging, techniques, such, as, positron, emission, tomography, pet, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, are, routinely, used, in, oncology, and, neuroscience, areas, for, example, measurement, of, tumour, shrinkage, is, a, commonly, used, surrogate, endpoint, in, solid, tumour, response, evaluation, this, allows, for, faster, and, more, objective, assessment, of, the, effects, of, anticancer, drugs, in, alzheimer, s, disease, mri, scans, of, the, entire, brain, can, accurately, assess, the, rate, of, hippocampal, atrophy, while, pet, scans, can, measure, the, brain, s, metabolic, activity, by, measuring, regional, glucose, metabolism, and, beta, amyloid, plaques, using, tracers, such, as, pittsburgh, compound, b, pib, historically, less, use, has, been, made, of, quantitative, medical, imaging, in, other, areas, of, drug, development, although, interest, is, growing, an, imaging, based, trial, will, usually, be, made, up, of, three, components, medical, imaging, can, lead, to, patient, and, healthcare, provider, harm, through, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, iodinated, contrast, magnetic, fields, and, other, hazards, lead, is, the, main, material, used, for, radiographic, shielding, against, scattered, x, rays, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, there, is, mri, rf, shielding, as, well, as, magnetic, shielding, to, prevent, external, disturbance, of, image, quality, medical, imaging, are, generally, covered, by, laws, of, medical, privacy, for, example, in, the, united, states, the, health, insurance, portability, and, accountability, act, hipaa, sets, restrictions, for, health, care, providers, on, utilizing, protected, health, information, which, is, any, individually, identifiable,
