an, image, scanner, often, abbreviated, to, just, scanner, is, a, device, that, optically, scans, images, printed, text, handwriting, or, an, object, and, converts, it, to, a, digital, image, the, most, common, type, of, scanner, used, in, offices, and, in, the, home, is, the, flatbed, scanner, where, the, document, is, placed, on, a, glass, window, for, scanning, a, sheetfed, scanner, which, moves, the, page, across, an, image, sensor, using, a, series, of, rollers, may, be, used, to, scan, one, document, at, a, time, or, multiple, as, in, an, automatic, document, feeder, a, handheld, scanner, is, a, portable, version, of, an, image, scanner, that, can, be, used, on, any, flat, surface, scans, are, usually, downloaded, to, the, computer, that, the, scanner, is, connected, to, although, some, scanners, are, able, to, store, scans, on, standalone, flash, media, e, g, memory, cards, and, usb, drives, modern, scanners, typically, use, a, charge, coupled, device, ccd, or, a, contact, image, sensor, cis, as, the, image, sensor, whereas, drum, scanners, developed, earlier, and, still, used, for, the, highest, possible, image, quality, use, a, photomultiplier, tube, pmt, as, the, image, sensor, document, cameras, which, use, commodity, or, specialized, high, resolution, cameras, photograph, documents, all, at, once, image, scanners, are, considered, the, successors, of, early, facsimile, fax, machines, 2, the, earliest, attempt, at, a, fax, machine, was, patented, in, 1843, by, the, scottish, clockmaker, alexander, bain, but, never, put, into, production, in, his, design, a, metal, stylus, linked, to, a, pendulum, scans, across, a, copper, plate, with, a, raised, image, when, the, stylus, makes, contact, with, a, raised, part, of, the, plate, it, sends, a, pulse, across, a, pair, of, wires, to, a, receiver, containing, an, electrode, linked, to, another, pendulum, a, piece, of, paper, impregnated, with, an, electrochemically, sensitive, solution, resides, underneath, the, electrode, and, changes, color, whenever, a, pulse, reaches, the, electrode, a, gear, advances, the, copper, plate, and, paper, in, tandem, with, each, swing, of, the, pendulum, over, time, the, result, is, a, perfect, reproduction, of, the, copper, plate, in, bain, s, system, it, is, critical, that, the, pendulums, of, the, transceiver, and, receiver, are, in, perfect, step, or, else, the, reproduced, image, will, be, distorted, in, 1847, the, english, physicist, frederick, bakewell, developed, the, first, working, fax, machine, bakewell, s, machine, was, similar, to, bain, s, but, used, a, revolving, drum, coated, in, tinfoil, with, non, conductive, ink, painted, on, the, foil, and, a, stylus, that, scans, across, the, drum, and, sends, a, pulse, down, a, pair, of, wires, when, it, contacts, a, conductive, point, on, the, foil, the, receiver, contains, an, electrode, that, touches, a, sheet, of, chemically, treated, paper, which, changes, color, when, the, electrode, receives, a, pulse, the, result, is, a, reverse, contrast, white, on, blue, reproduction, of, the, original, image, bakewell, s, fax, machine, was, marginally, more, successful, than, bain, s, but, suffered, from, the, same, synchronization, issues, in, 1862, giovanni, caselli, solved, this, with, the, pantelegraph, the, first, fax, machine, put, into, regular, service, largely, based, on, bain, s, design, it, ensured, complete, synchronization, by, flanking, the, pendulums, of, both, the, transceiver, and, receiver, between, two, magnetic, regulators, which, become, magnetized, with, each, swing, of, the, pendulum, and, become, demagnetized, when, the, pendulum, reaches, the, maxima, and, minima, of, each, oscillation, in, 1893, the, american, engineer, elisha, gray, introduced, the, telautograph, the, first, widely, commercially, successful, fax, machine, that, used, linkage, bars, translating, x, and, y, axis, motion, at, the, receiver, to, scan, a, pen, across, the, paper, and, strike, it, only, when, actuated, by, the, stylus, moving, across, the, transceiver, drum, because, it, could, use, commodity, stationery, paper, it, became, popular, in, business, and, hospitals, in, 1902, the, german, engineer, arthur, korn, introduced, the, phototelautograph, a, fax, machine, that, used, a, light, sensitive, selenium, cell, to, scan, a, paper, to, be, copied, instead, of, relying, on, a, metallic, drum, and, stylus, it, was, even, more, commercially, successful, than, gray, s, machine, and, became, the, basis, for, telephotography, machines, used, by, newspapers, around, the, world, from, the, early, 1900s, onward, alexander, murray, and, richard, morse, invented, and, patented, the, first, analog, color, scanner, at, eastman, kodak, in, 1937, intended, for, color, separation, at, printing, presses, their, machine, was, an, analog, drum, scanner, that, imaged, a, color, transparency, mounted, in, the, drum, with, a, light, source, placed, underneath, the, film, and, three, photocells, with, red, green, and, blue, color, filters, reading, each, spot, on, the, transparency, to, translate, the, image, into, three, electronic, signals, in, murray, and, morse, s, initial, design, the, drum, was, connected, to, three, lathes, that, etched, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, cmy, halftone, dots, onto, three, offset, cylinders, directly, the, rights, to, the, patent, were, sold, to, printing, developments, incorporated, p, d, i, in, 1946, who, improved, on, the, design, by, using, a, photomultiplier, tube, to, image, the, points, on, the, negative, which, produced, an, amplified, signal, that, was, then, fed, to, a, single, purpose, computer, that, procesed, the, rgb, signals, into, color, corrected, cyan, magenta, yellow, and, black, cmyk, values, the, processed, signals, are, then, sent, to, four, lathes, that, etch, cmyk, halftone, dots, onto, the, offset, cylinders, in, 1948, arthur, hardy, of, the, interchemical, corporation, and, f, l, wurzburg, of, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, invented, the, first, analog, color, flatbed, image, scanner, intended, for, producing, color, corrected, lithographic, plates, from, a, color, negative, in, this, system, three, color, separated, plates, of, cmy, values, are, prepared, from, a, color, negative, via, dot, etching, and, placed, in, the, scanner, bed, above, each, plate, are, rigidly, fixed, equidistant, light, beam, projectors, which, focus, a, beam, of, light, onto, one, corner, of, the, plate, the, entire, bed, with, all, three, plates, moves, horizontally, back, and, forth, to, reach, the, opposite, corners, of, the, plate, with, each, horiztonal, oscillation, of, the, bed, the, bed, moves, down, one, step, to, cover, the, entire, vertical, area, of, the, plate, while, this, is, happening, the, beam, of, light, focused, on, a, given, spot, on, the, plate, get, reflected, and, bounced, off, to, a, photocell, adjacent, to, the, projector, each, photocell, connects, to, an, analog, image, processor, which, evaluates, the, reflectance, of, the, combined, cmy, values, using, neugebauer, equations, and, outputs, a, signal, to, a, light, projector, hovering, over, a, fourth, unexposed, lithographic, plate, this, plate, receives, a, color, corrected, continuous, tone, dot, etch, of, either, the, cyan, magenta, or, yellow, values, the, fourth, plate, is, replaced, with, another, unexposed, plate, and, the, process, repeats, until, three, color, corrected, plates, of, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, are, produced, in, the, 1950s, the, radio, corporation, of, american, rca, took, hardy, and, wurzburg, s, patent, and, replaced, the, projector, and, photocell, arrangement, with, a, video, camera, tube, focusing, on, one, spot, of, the, plate, the, first, digital, imaging, system, was, the, bartlane, system, in, 1920, named, after, the, pair, who, invented, it, harry, g, bartholomew, and, maynard, d, mcfarlane, the, bartlane, system, used, zinc, plates, etched, with, an, image, from, a, film, negative, projected, at, five, different, exposure, levels, to, correspond, to, five, quantization, levels, all, five, plates, are, affixed, to, a, long, motor, driven, rotating, cylinder, with, five, equidistant, contacts, scanning, over, each, plate, at, the, same, starting, position, the, bartlane, system, was, initially, used, exclusively, by, telegraph, with, the, five, bit, baudot, code, used, to, transmit, the, grayscale, digital, image, in, 1921, the, system, was, modified, for, offline, use, with, a, five, bit, paper, tape, punch, punching, holes, depending, on, whether, its, connections, to, the, contacts, are, bridged, or, not, the, result, was, a, stored, digital, image, with, five, gray, levels, reproduction, of, the, image, was, achieved, with, a, lamp, passing, over, the, punched, holes, exposing, five, different, intensities, of, light, onto, a, film, negative, the, first, scanner, to, store, its, images, digitally, onto, a, computer, was, a, drum, scanner, built, in, 1957, at, the, national, bureau, of, standards, nbs, later, nist, by, a, team, led, by, russell, a, kirsch, it, used, a, photomultiplier, tube, to, detect, light, at, a, given, point, and, produced, an, amplified, signal, that, a, computer, could, read, and, store, into, memory, the, computer, of, choice, at, the, time, was, the, seac, mainframe, the, maximum, horizontal, resolution, that, the, seac, was, capable, of, processing, was, 176, pixels, the, first, image, ever, scanned, on, this, machine, was, a, photograph, of, kirsch, s, three, month, old, son, walden, in, 1969, dacom, introduced, the, 111, fax, machine, which, was, the, first, digital, fax, machine, to, employ, data, compression, using, an, on, board, computer, it, employed, a, flatbed, design, with, a, continuous, feed, capable, of, scanning, up, to, letter, paper, in, 1, bit, monochrome, black, and, white, the, first, flatbed, scanner, used, for, digital, image, processing, was, the, autokon, 8400, introduced, by, ecrm, inc, a, subsidirary, of, am, international, in, 1975, the, autokon, 8400, used, a, laser, beam, to, scan, pages, up, to, 11, by, 14, inches, at, a, maximum, resolution, 1000, lines, per, inch, although, it, was, only, capable, of, scanning, in, 1, bit, monochrome, the, on, board, processor, was, capable, of, halftoning, unsharp, masking, contrast, adjustment, and, anamorphic, distortions, among, other, features, 53, the, autokon, 8400, could, either, be, connected, to, a, film, recorder, to, create, a, negative, for, producing, plates, or, connected, to, a, mainframe, or, minicomputer, for, further, image, processing, and, digital, storage, 53, the, autokon, 8400, enjoyed, widespread, use, in, newspapers, ecrm, shipping, 1, 000, units, to, newspaper, publishers, by, 1985, but, its, limited, resolution, and, maximum, scan, size, made, it, unsuitable, for, commercial, printing, in, 1982, ecrm, introduced, the, autokon, 8500, capable, of, scanning, up, to, 1200, lines, per, inch, four, of, ecrm, s, competitors, introduced, commercial, flatbed, scanners, that, year, including, scitex, agfa, gevaert, and, linotype, hell, all, of, which, were, capable, of, scanning, larger, prints, at, higher, resolutions, in, 1977, raymond, kurzweil, of, his, start, up, company, kurzweil, computer, products, released, the, kurzweil, reading, machine, which, was, the, first, flatbed, scanner, with, a, charge, coupled, device, ccd, imaging, element, the, kurzweil, reading, machine, was, invented, to, assist, blind, people, in, reading, books, that, had, not, been, translated, to, braile, it, comprised, the, image, scanner, and, a, data, general, nova, minicomputer, the, latter, performing, the, image, processing, optical, character, recognition, ocr, and, speech, synthesis, the, first, scanners, for, personal, computers, appeared, in, the, mid, 1980s, starting, with, thunderscan, for, the, macintosh, in, december, 1984, designed, by, andy, hertzfeld, and, released, by, thunderware, inc, the, thunderscan, contains, a, specialized, image, sensor, built, into, a, plastic, housing, the, same, shape, as, the, ink, ribbon, cartridge, of, apple, s, imagewriter, printer, the, thunderscan, slots, into, the, imagewriter, s, ribbon, carrier, and, connects, to, both, the, imagewriter, and, the, macintosh, simultaneously, the, imagewriter, s, carriage, controlled, by, the, thunderscan, moves, left, to, right, to, scan, one, 200, dpi, dots, per, inch, line, at, a, time, with, the, carriage, return, serving, to, advance, the, scanner, down, the, print, to, be, scanned, the, thunderscan, was, the, macintosh, s, first, scanner, and, sold, well, but, operated, very, slowly, and, was, only, capable, of, scanning, prints, at, 1, bit, monochrome, in, 1999, canon, iterated, on, this, idea, with, the, is, 22, a, cartridge, that, fit, into, their, inkjet, printers, to, convert, them, into, sheetfed, scanners, in, early, 1985, the, first, flatbed, scanner, for, the, ibm, pc, the, datacopy, model, 700, was, released, based, on, a, ccd, imaging, element, the, model, 700, was, capable, of, scanning, letter, sized, documents, at, a, maximum, resolution, of, 200, dpi, at, 1, bit, monochrome, the, model, 700, came, with, a, special, interface, card, for, connecting, to, the, pc, and, an, optional, aftermarket, ocr, software, card, and, software, package, was, sold, for, the, model, 700, 69, in, april, 1985, laserfax, inc, introduced, the, first, ccd, based, color, flatbed, scanner, the, spectrascan, 200, for, the, ibm, pc, the, spectrascan, 200, worked, by, placing, color, filters, over, the, ccd, and, taking, four, passes, three, for, each, primary, color, and, one, for, black, per, scan, to, build, up, a, color, reproduction, the, spectrascan, 200, took, between, two, and, three, minutes, to, produce, a, scan, of, a, letter, sized, print, at, 200, dpi, its, grayscale, counterpart, the, ds, 200, took, only, 30, seconds, to, make, a, scan, at, the, same, size, and, resolution, the, first, relatively, affordable, flatbed, scanner, for, personal, computers, appeared, in, february, 1987, with, hewlett, packard, s, scanjet, which, was, capable, of, scanning, 4, bit, 64, shade, grayscale, images, at, a, maximum, resolution, of, 300, dpi, by, the, beginning, of, 1988, the, scanjet, had, accounted, 27, percent, of, all, scanner, sales, in, terms, of, dollar, volume, per, gartner, dataquest, in, february, 1989, the, company, introduced, the, scanjet, plus, which, increased, the, bit, depth, to, 8, bits, 256, shades, while, costing, only, us, 200, more, than, the, original, scanjet, s, 1990, equivalent, to, 4, 891, in, 2023, this, led, to, a, massive, price, drop, in, grayscale, scanners, with, equivalent, or, lesser, features, in, the, market, the, amount, of, third, party, developers, producing, software, and, hardware, supporting, these, scanners, jumped, dramatically, in, turn, effectively, popularizing, the, scanner, for, the, personal, computer, user, by, 1999, the, cost, of, the, average, color, capable, scanner, had, dropped, to, 300, equivalent, to, 549, in, 2023, that, year, computer, shopper, declared, 1999, the, year, that, scanners, finally, became, a, mainstream, commodity, a, flatbed, scanner, is, a, type, of, scanner, that, provides, a, glass, bed, platen, on, which, the, object, to, be, scanned, lies, motionless, the, scanning, element, moves, vertically, from, under, the, glass, scanning, either, the, entirety, of, the, platen, or, a, predetermined, portion, the, driver, software, for, most, flatbed, scanners, allows, users, to, prescan, their, documents, in, essence, to, take, a, quick, low, resolution, pass, at, a, document, in, order, to, judge, what, area, of, the, document, should, be, scanned, if, not, the, entirety, of, it, before, scanning, it, at, a, higher, resolution, some, flatbed, scanners, incorporate, sheet, feeding, mechanisms, called, automatic, document, feeders, adfs, that, use, the, same, scanning, element, as, the, flatbed, portion, this, type, of, scanner, is, sometimes, called, a, reflective, scanner, because, it, works, by, shining, white, light, onto, the, object, to, be, scanned, and, reading, the, intensity, and, color, of, light, that, is, reflected, from, it, usually, a, line, at, a, time, they, are, designed, for, scanning, prints, or, other, flat, opaque, materials, but, some, have, available, transparency, adapters, which, for, a, number, of, reasons, in, most, cases, are, not, very, well, suited, to, scanning, film, a, sheetfed, scanner, also, known, as, a, document, feeder, is, a, type, of, scanner, that, uses, motor, driven, rollers, to, move, one, single, sheet, of, paper, at, a, time, past, a, stationary, scanning, element, two, scanning, elements, in, the, case, of, scanners, with, duplex, functionality, unlike, flatbed, scanners, sheetfed, scanners, are, not, equipped, to, scan, bound, material, such, as, books, or, magazines, nor, are, they, suitable, for, any, material, thicker, than, plain, printer, paper, some, sheetfed, scanners, called, automatic, document, feeders, adfs, are, capable, of, scanning, several, sheets, in, one, session, although, others, only, accept, one, page, at, a, time, some, sheetfed, scanners, are, portable, powered, by, batteries, and, with, their, own, storage, eventually, transferring, stored, scans, to, a, computer, a, handheld, scanner, is, a, type, of, scanner, that, must, be, manually, dragged, or, gilded, by, hand, across, the, surface, of, the, object, to, be, scanned, scanning, documents, in, this, manner, requires, a, steady, hand, as, an, uneven, scanning, rate, produces, distorted, images, some, handheld, scanners, have, an, indicator, light, on, the, scanner, for, this, purpose, actuating, if, the, user, is, moving, the, scanner, too, fast, they, typically, have, at, least, one, button, that, starts, the, scan, when, pressed, it, is, held, by, the, user, for, the, duration, of, the, scan, some, other, handheld, scanners, have, switches, to, set, the, optical, resolution, as, well, as, a, roller, which, generates, a, clock, pulse, for, synchronization, with, the, computer, older, hand, scanners, were, monochrome, and, produced, light, from, an, array, of, green, leds, to, illuminate, the, image, later, ones, scan, in, monochrome, or, color, as, desired, a, hand, scanner, may, have, also, a, small, window, through, which, the, document, being, scanned, could, be, viewed, as, hand, scanners, are, much, narrower, than, most, normal, document, or, book, sizes, software, or, the, end, user, needed, to, combine, several, narrow, strips, of, scanned, documents, to, produce, the, finished, article, inexpensive, portable, battery, powered, or, usb, powered, wand, scanners, and, pen, scanners, typically, capable, of, scanning, an, area, as, wide, as, a, normal, letter, and, much, longer, remain, available, as, of, 2024, some, computer, mice, can, also, scan, documents, a, drum, scanner, is, a, type, of, scanner, that, uses, a, clear, motor, driven, rotating, cylinder, drum, onto, which, a, print, a, film, negative, a, transparency, or, any, other, flat, object, is, taped, or, otherwise, secured, a, beam, of, light, either, projects, past, or, reflects, off, the, material, to, be, scanned, onto, a, series, of, mirrors, which, focus, the, beam, onto, the, drum, scanner, s, photomultiplier, tube, pmt, after, one, revolution, the, beam, of, light, moves, down, a, single, step, when, scanning, transparent, media, such, as, negatives, a, light, beam, is, directed, from, within, the, cylinder, onto, the, media, when, scanning, opaque, items, a, light, beam, from, above, is, reflected, off, the, surface, of, the, media, when, only, one, pmt, is, present, three, passes, of, the, image, are, required, for, a, full, color, rgb, scan, when, three, pmts, are, present, only, a, single, pass, is, required, the, photomultiplier, tubes, of, drum, scanners, offer, superior, dynamic, range, to, that, of, ccd, sensors, for, this, reason, drum, scanners, can, extract, more, detail, from, very, dark, shadow, areas, of, a, transparency, than, flatbed, scanners, using, ccd, sensors, the, smaller, dynamic, range, of, the, ccd, sensors, versus, photomultiplier, tubes, can, lead, to, loss, of, shadow, detail, especially, when, scanning, very, dense, transparency, film, drum, scanners, are, also, able, to, resolve, true, detail, in, excess, of, 10000, dpi, producing, higher, resolution, scans, than, any, ccd, scanner, an, overhead, scanner, is, a, type, of, scanner, that, places, the, scanning, element, in, a, housing, on, top, of, a, vertical, post, hovering, above, the, document, or, object, to, be, scanned, which, lies, stationary, on, an, open, air, bed, chinon, industries, patented, a, specific, type, of, overhead, scanner, which, uses, a, rotating, mirror, to, reflect, the, contents, of, the, bed, onto, a, linear, ccd, in, 1987, although, very, flexible, allowing, users, to, scan, not, only, two, dimensional, prints, and, documents, but, any, 3d, object, of, any, size, the, chinon, design, required, the, user, to, provide, uniform, illumination, of, the, object, to, be, scanned, and, was, more, cumbersome, to, set, up, a, more, modern, type, of, overhead, scanner, is, a, document, camera, also, known, as, a, video, scanner, which, uses, a, digital, camera, to, capture, a, document, all, at, once, most, document, cameras, output, live, video, of, the, document, and, are, usually, reserved, for, displaying, documents, to, a, live, audience, but, they, may, also, be, used, as, replacements, for, image, scanners, capturing, a, single, frame, of, the, output, as, an, image, file, document, cameras, may, even, use, the, same, apis, as, scanners, when, connected, to, computers, a, planetary, scanner, is, a, type, of, very, high, resolution, document, camera, used, for, capturing, certain, fragile, documents, a, book, scanner, is, another, kind, of, document, camera, pairing, a, digital, camera, with, a, scanning, area, defined, by, a, mat, to, assist, in, scanning, books, some, more, advanced, models, of, book, scanners, project, a, laser, onto, the, page, for, calibration, and, software, skew, correction, a, film, scanner, also, known, as, a, slide, scanner, or, a, transparency, scanner, is, a, type, of, specialized, flatbed, scanner, specifically, for, scanning, film, negatives, and, slides, a, typical, film, scanner, works, by, passing, a, narrowly, focused, beam, of, light, through, the, film, and, reading, the, intensity, and, color, of, the, light, that, emerges, the, lowest, cost, dedicated, film, scanners, can, be, had, for, less, than, 50, and, they, might, be, sufficient, for, modest, needs, from, there, they, inch, up, in, staggered, levels, of, quality, and, advanced, features, upward, of, five, figures, image, scanners, are, usually, used, in, conjunction, with, a, computer, which, controls, the, scanner, and, stores, scans, small, portable, scanners, either, sheetfed, or, handheld, and, operated, by, batteries, and, with, storage, capability, are, available, for, use, away, from, a, computer, stored, scans, can, be, transferred, later, many, can, scan, both, small, documents, such, as, business, cards, and, till, receipts, as, well, as, letter, sized, documents, the, higher, resolution, cameras, fitted, to, some, smartphones, can, produce, reasonable, quality, document, scans, by, taking, a, photograph, with, the, phone, s, camera, and, post, processing, it, with, a, scanning, app, a, range, of, which, are, available, for, most, phone, operating, systems, to, whiten, the, background, of, a, page, correct, perspective, distortion, so, that, the, shape, of, a, rectangular, document, is, corrected, convert, to, black, and, white, etc, many, such, apps, can, scan, multiple, page, documents, with, successive, camera, exposures, and, output, them, either, as, a, single, file, or, multiple, page, files, some, smartphone, scanning, apps, can, save, documents, directly, to, online, storage, locations, such, as, dropbox, and, evernote, send, via, email, or, fax, documents, via, email, to, fax, gateways, smartphone, scanner, apps, can, be, broadly, divided, into, three, categories, scanners, equiped, with, charge, coupled, device, ccd, scanning, elements, require, a, sophisticated, series, of, mirrors, and, lenses, to, reproduce, an, image, but, the, result, of, this, complexity, is, a, much, higher, quality, scan, because, ccds, have, a, much, greater, depth, of, field, they, are, more, forgiving, when, it, comes, to, scanning, documents, that, are, difficult, to, get, perfectly, flat, against, the, platen, such, as, bound, books, scanners, equiped, with, contact, image, sensor, cis, scanning, elements, are, designed, to, be, in, near, direct, contact, with, the, document, to, be, scanned, and, thus, do, not, require, the, complex, optics, of, ccds, scanners, however, their, depth, of, field, is, much, worse, resulting, in, blurry, scans, if, the, scanned, document, is, not, perfectly, flush, against, the, platten, because, the, sensors, require, far, less, power, than, ccd, scanners, cis, scanners, are, able, to, be, manufactured, down, to, a, low, cost, and, are, typically, much, lighter, in, weight, and, depth, than, ccd, scanners, scanners, equiped, with, photomultiplier, tubes, pmt, are, nearly, exclusively, drum, scanners, color, scanners, typically, read, rgb, red, green, blue, color, data, from, the, array, this, data, is, then, processed, with, some, proprietary, algorithm, to, correct, for, different, exposure, conditions, and, sent, to, the, computer, via, the, device, s, input, output, interface, usually, usb, previous, to, which, was, scsi, or, bidirectional, parallel, port, in, older, units, color, depth, varies, depending, on, the, scanning, array, characteristics, but, is, usually, at, least, 24, bits, high, quality, models, have, 36, 48, bits, of, color, depth, another, qualifying, parameter, for, a, scanner, is, its, resolution, measured, in, pixels, per, inch, ppi, sometimes, more, accurately, referred, to, as, samples, per, inch, spi, instead, of, using, the, scanner, s, true, optical, resolution, the, only, meaningful, parameter, manufacturers, like, to, refer, to, the, interpolated, resolution, which, is, much, higher, thanks, to, software, interpolation, as, of, 2009, a, high, end, flatbed, scanner, can, scan, up, to, 5400, ppi, and, drum, scanners, have, an, optical, resolution, of, between, 3000, and, 24000, ppi, effective, resolution, refers, to, the, true, resolution, of, a, scanner, and, is, determined, by, using, a, resolution, test, chart, the, effective, resolution, of, most, all, consumer, flatbed, scanners, is, considerably, lower, than, the, manufactures, given, optical, resolution, manufacturers, often, claim, interpolated, resolutions, as, high, as, 19200, ppi, but, such, numbers, carry, little, meaningful, value, because, the, number, of, possible, interpolated, pixels, is, unlimited, and, doing, so, does, not, increase, the, level, of, captured, detail, the, size, of, the, file, created, increases, with, the, square, of, the, resolution, doubling, the, resolution, quadruples, the, file, size, a, resolution, must, be, chosen, that, is, within, the, capabilities, of, the, equipment, preserves, sufficient, detail, and, does, not, produce, a, file, of, excessive, size, the, file, size, can, be, reduced, for, a, given, resolution, by, using, lossy, compression, methods, such, as, jpeg, at, some, cost, in, quality, if, the, best, possible, quality, is, required, lossless, compression, should, be, used, reduced, quality, files, of, smaller, size, can, be, produced, from, such, an, image, when, required, e, g, image, designed, to, be, printed, on, a, full, page, and, a, much, smaller, file, to, be, displayed, as, part, of, a, fast, loading, web, page, purity, can, be, diminished, by, scanner, noise, optical, flare, poor, analog, to, digital, conversion, scratches, dust, newton, s, rings, out, of, focus, sensors, improper, scanner, operation, and, poor, software, drum, scanners, are, said, to, produce, the, purest, digital, representations, of, the, film, followed, by, high, end, film, scanners, that, use, the, larger, kodak, tri, linear, sensors, the, third, important, parameter, for, a, scanner, is, its, dynamic, range, also, known, as, density, range, a, high, density, range, means, that, the, scanner, is, able, to, record, shadow, details, and, brightness, details, in, one, scan, density, of, film, is, measured, on, a, base, 10, log, scale, and, varies, between, 0, 0, transparent, and, 5, 0, about, 16, stops, density, range, is, the, space, taken, up, in, the, 0, to, 5, scale, and, dmin, and, dmax, denote, where, the, least, dense, and, most, dense, measurements, on, a, negative, or, positive, film, the, density, range, of, negative, film, is, up, to, 3, 6d, while, slide, film, dynamic, range, is, 2, 4d, color, negative, density, range, after, processing, is, 2, 0d, thanks, to, the, compression, of, the, 12, stops, into, a, small, density, range, dmax, will, be, the, densest, on, slide, film, for, shadows, and, densest, on, negative, film, for, highlights, some, slide, films, can, have, a, dmax, close, to, 4, 0d, with, proper, exposure, and, so, can, black, and, white, negative, film, consumer, level, flatbed, photo, scanners, have, a, dynamic, range, in, the, 2, 0, 3, 0, range, which, can, be, inadequate, for, scanning, all, types, of, photographic, film, as, dmax, can, be, and, often, is, between, 3, 0d, and, 4, 0d, with, traditional, black, and, white, film, color, film, compresses, its, 12, stops, of, a, possible, 16, stops, film, latitude, into, just, 2, 0d, of, space, via, the, process, of, dye, coupling, and, removal, of, all, silver, from, the, emulsion, kodak, vision, 3, has, 18, stops, so, color, negative, film, scans, the, easiest, of, all, film, types, on, the, widest, range, of, scanners, because, traditional, black, and, white, film, retains, the, image, creating, silver, after, processing, density, range, can, be, almost, twice, that, of, color, film, this, makes, scanning, traditional, black, and, white, film, more, difficult, and, requires, a, scanner, with, at, least, a, 3, 6d, dynamic, range, but, also, a, dmax, between, 4, 0d, to, 5, 0d, high, end, photo, lab, flatbed, scanners, can, reach, a, dynamic, range, of, 3, 7, and, dmax, around, 4, 0d, dedicated, film, scanners, have, a, dynamic, range, between, 3, 0d, 4, 0d, office, document, scanners, can, have, a, dynamic, range, of, less, than, 2, 0d, drum, scanners, have, a, dynamic, range, of, 3, 6, 4, 5, for, scanning, film, infrared, cleaning, is, a, technique, used, to, remove, the, effects, of, dust, and, scratches, on, images, scanned, from, film, many, modern, scanners, incorporate, this, feature, it, works, by, scanning, the, film, with, infrared, light, the, dyes, in, typical, color, film, emulsions, are, transparent, to, infrared, light, but, dust, and, scratches, are, not, and, block, infrared, scanner, software, can, use, the, visible, and, infrared, information, to, detect, scratches, and, process, the, image, to, greatly, reduce, their, visibility, considering, their, position, size, shape, and, surroundings, scanner, manufacturers, usually, have, their, own, names, attached, to, this, technique, for, example, epson, minolta, nikon, konica, minolta, microtek, and, others, use, digital, ice, while, canon, uses, its, own, system, fare, film, automatic, retouching, and, enhancement, plustek, uses, lasersoft, imaging, isrd, some, independent, software, developers, design, infrared, cleaning, tools, by, combining, full, color, imagery, with, 3d, models, modern, hand, held, scanners, are, able, to, completely, reproduce, objects, electronically, the, addition, of, 3d, color, printers, enables, accurate, miniaturization, of, these, objects, with, applications, across, many, industries, and, professions, for, scanner, apps, the, scan, quality, is, highly, dependent, on, the, quality, of, the, phone, camera, and, on, the, framing, chosen, by, the, user, of, the, app, scans, must, virtually, always, be, transferred, from, the, scanner, to, a, computer, or, information, storage, system, for, further, processing, or, storage, there, are, two, basic, issues, 1, how, the, scanner, is, physically, connected, to, the, computer, and, 2, how, the, application, retrieves, the, information, from, the, scanner, the, file, size, of, a, scan, can, go, up, to, about, 100, mb, for, a, 600, dpi, 23, 28, cm, slightly, larger, than, a4, paper, uncompressed, 24, bit, image, scanned, files, must, be, transferred, and, stored, scanners, can, generate, this, volume, of, data, in, a, matter, of, seconds, making, a, fast, connection, desirable, scanners, communicate, to, their, host, computer, using, one, of, the, following, physical, interfaces, listing, roughly, from, slow, to, fast, during, the, early, 1990s, professional, flatbed, scanners, were, available, over, a, local, computer, network, this, proved, useful, to, publishers, print, shops, etc, this, functionality, largely, fell, out, of, use, as, the, cost, of, flatbed, scanners, reduced, enough, to, make, sharing, unnecessary, from, 2000, all, in, one, multi, purpose, devices, became, available, which, were, suitable, for, both, small, offices, and, consumers, with, printing, scanning, copying, and, fax, capability, in, a, single, apparatus, that, can, be, made, available, to, all, members, of, a, workgroup, battery, powered, portable, scanners, store, scans, on, internal, memory, they, can, later, be, transferred, to, a, computer, either, by, direct, connection, typically, usb, or, in, some, cases, a, memory, card, may, be, removed, from, the, scanner, and, plugged, into, the, computer, a, raster, image, editor, must, be, able, to, communicate, with, a, scanner, there, are, many, different, scanners, and, many, of, those, scanners, use, different, protocols, in, order, to, simplify, applications, programming, some, application, programming, interfaces, apis, were, developed, the, api, presents, a, uniform, interface, to, the, scanner, this, means, that, the, application, does, not, need, to, know, the, specific, details, of, the, scanner, in, order, to, access, it, directly, for, example, adobe, photoshop, supports, the, twain, standard, therefore, in, theory, photoshop, can, acquire, an, image, from, any, scanner, that, has, a, twain, driver, in, practice, there, are, often, problems, with, an, application, communicating, with, a, scanner, either, the, application, or, the, scanner, manufacturer, or, both, may, have, faults, in, their, implementation, of, the, api, typically, the, api, is, implemented, as, a, dynamically, linked, library, each, scanner, manufacturer, provides, software, that, translates, the, api, procedure, calls, into, primitive, commands, that, are, issued, to, a, hardware, controller, such, as, the, scsi, usb, or, firewire, controller, the, manufacturer, s, part, of, the, api, is, commonly, called, a, device, driver, but, that, designation, is, not, strictly, accurate, the, api, does, not, run, in, kernel, mode, and, does, not, directly, access, the, device, rather, the, scanner, api, library, translates, application, requests, into, hardware, requests, common, scanner, software, api, include, although, no, software, beyond, a, scanning, utility, is, a, feature, of, any, scanner, many, scanners, come, bundled, with, software, typically, in, addition, to, the, scanning, utility, some, type, of, raster, image, editor, such, as, photoshop, or, gimp, and, optical, character, recognition, ocr, software, are, supplied, ocr, software, converts, graphical, images, of, text, into, standard, text, that, can, be, edited, using, common, word, processing, and, text, editing, software, accuracy, is, rarely, perfect, some, scanners, especially, those, designed, for, scanning, printed, documents, only, work, in, black, and, white, but, most, modern, scanners, work, in, color, for, the, latter, the, scanned, result, is, a, non, compressed, rgb, image, which, can, be, transferred, to, a, computer, s, memory, the, color, output, of, different, scanners, is, not, the, same, due, to, the, spectral, response, of, their, sensing, elements, the, nature, of, their, light, source, and, the, correction, applied, by, the, scanning, software, while, most, image, sensors, have, a, linear, response, the, output, values, are, usually, gamma, compressed, some, scanners, compress, and, clean, up, the, image, using, embedded, firmware, once, on, the, computer, the, image, can, be, processed, with, raster, graphics, editor, such, as, photoshop, and, saved, on, a, storage, device, such, as, a, hard, disk, scans, may, be, stored, uncompressed, in, image, file, formats, such, as, bmp, stored, losslessly, compressed, in, file, formats, such, as, tiff, and, png, and, stored, lossy, compressed, in, file, formats, such, as, jpeg, or, stored, as, embedded, images, or, converted, to, vector, graphics, within, a, pdf, optical, character, recognition, ocr, software, allows, a, scanned, image, of, text, to, be, converted, into, editable, text, with, reasonable, accuracy, so, long, as, the, text, is, cleanly, printed, and, in, a, typeface, and, size, that, can, be, read, by, the, software, ocr, capability, may, be, integrated, into, the, scanning, software, or, the, scanned, image, file, can, be, processed, with, a, separate, ocr, program, document, processing, requirements, differ, from, those, of, image, scanning, these, requirements, include, scanning, speed, automated, paper, feed, and, the, ability, to, automatically, scan, both, the, front, and, the, back, of, a, document, on, the, other, hand, image, scanning, typically, requires, the, ability, to, handle, fragile, and, or, three, dimensional, objects, as, well, as, scan, at, a, much, higher, resolution, document, scanners, have, document, feeders, usually, larger, than, those, sometimes, found, on, copiers, or, all, purpose, scanners, scans, are, made, at, high, speed, from, 20, up, to, 420, pages, per, minute, often, in, grayscale, although, many, scanners, support, color, many, scanners, can, scan, both, sides, of, double, sided, originals, duplex, operation, sophisticated, document, scanners, have, firmware, or, software, that, cleans, up, scans, of, text, as, they, are, produced, eliminating, accidental, marks, and, sharpening, type, this, would, be, unacceptable, for, photographic, work, where, marks, cannot, reliably, be, distinguished, from, desired, fine, detail, files, created, are, compressed, as, they, are, made, the, resolution, used, is, usually, from, 150, to, 300, dpi, although, the, hardware, may, be, capable, of, 600, or, higher, resolution, this, produces, images, of, text, good, enough, to, read, and, for, ocr, without, the, higher, demands, on, storage, space, required, by, higher, resolution, images, document, scans, are, often, processed, using, ocr, technology, to, create, editable, and, searchable, files, most, scanners, use, isis, or, twain, device, drivers, to, scan, documents, into, tiff, format, so, that, the, scanned, pages, can, be, fed, into, a, document, management, system, that, will, handle, the, archiving, and, retrieval, of, the, scanned, pages, lossy, jpeg, compression, which, is, very, efficient, for, pictures, is, undesirable, for, text, documents, as, slanted, straight, edges, take, on, a, jagged, appearance, and, solid, black, or, other, color, text, on, a, light, background, compresses, well, with, lossless, compression, formats, while, paper, feeding, and, scanning, can, be, done, automatically, and, quickly, preparation, and, indexing, are, necessary, and, require, much, work, by, humans, preparation, involves, manually, inspecting, the, papers, to, be, scanned, and, making, sure, that, they, are, in, order, unfolded, without, staples, or, anything, else, that, might, jam, the, scanner, additionally, some, industries, such, as, legal, and, medical, may, require, documents, to, have, bates, numbering, or, some, other, mark, giving, a, document, identification, number, and, date, time, of, the, document, scan, indexing, involves, associating, relevant, keywords, to, files, so, that, they, can, be, retrieved, by, content, this, process, can, sometimes, be, automated, to, some, extent, but, it, often, requires, manual, labour, performed, by, data, entry, clerks, one, common, practice, is, the, use, of, barcode, recognition, technology, during, preparation, barcode, sheets, with, folder, names, or, index, information, are, inserted, into, the, document, files, folders, and, document, groups, using, automatic, batch, scanning, the, documents, are, saved, into, appropriate, folders, and, an, index, is, created, for, integration, into, document, management, systems, a, specialized, form, of, document, scanning, is, book, scanning, technical, difficulties, arise, from, the, books, usually, being, bound, and, sometimes, fragile, and, irreplaceable, but, some, manufacturers, have, developed, specialized, machinery, to, deal, with, this, often, special, robotic, mechanisms, are, used, to, automate, the, page, turning, and, scanning, process, flatbed, scanners, have, been, used, as, digital, backs, for, large, format, cameras, to, create, high, resolution, digital, images, of, static, subjects, a, modified, flatbed, scanner, has, been, used, for, documentation, and, quantification, of, thin, layer, chromatograms, detected, by, fluorescence, quenching, on, silica, gel, layers, containing, an, ultraviolet, uv, indicator, the, chromimage, is, allegedly, the, first, commercial, flatbed, scanner, densitometer, it, enables, acquisition, of, tlc, plate, images, and, quantification, of, chromatograms, by, use, of, galaxie, tlc, software, other, than, being, turned, into, densitometers, flatbed, scanners, were, also, turned, into, colorimeters, using, different, methods, trichromatic, color, analyser, is, allegedly, the, first, distributable, system, using, a, flatbed, scanner, as, a, tristimulus, colorimetric, device, flatbed, scanners, may, also, be, used, to, create, artwork, directly, in, a, practice, known, as, scanography, in, the, biomedical, research, field, detection, devices, for, dna, microarrays, are, also, referred, to, as, scanners, these, scanners, are, high, resolution, systems, up, to, 1, m, pixel, similar, to, microscopes, detection, is, performed, using, ccds, or, photomultiplier, tubes
