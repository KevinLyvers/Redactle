stairs, are, a, structure, designed, to, bridge, a, large, vertical, distance, between, lower, and, higher, levels, by, dividing, it, into, smaller, vertical, distances, this, is, achieved, as, a, diagonal, series, of, horizontal, platforms, called, steps, which, enable, passage, to, the, other, level, by, stepping, from, one, to, another, step, in, turn, steps, are, very, typically, rectangular, stairs, may, be, straight, round, or, may, consist, of, two, or, more, straight, pieces, connected, at, angles, types, of, stairs, include, staircases, also, called, stairways, and, escalators, some, alternatives, to, stairs, are, elevators, also, called, lifts, stairlifts, inclined, moving, walkways, ladders, and, ramps, a, stairwell, is, a, vertical, shaft, or, opening, that, contains, a, staircase, a, flight, of, stairs, is, an, inclined, part, of, a, staircase, consisting, of, steps, and, their, lateral, supports, if, supports, are, separate, from, steps, this, is, an, excerpt, from, staircase, the, concept, of, stairs, is, believed, to, be, 8000, years, old, and, are, one, of, the, oldest, structures, in, architectural, history, the, oldest, example, of, spiral, stairs, dates, back, to, the, 400s, bc, medieval, architecture, saw, experimentation, with, many, different, shapes, and, the, renaissance, even, more, so, with, varied, designs, a, stair, or, a, stairstep, is, one, step, in, a, flight, of, stairs, in, buildings, stairs, is, a, term, applied, to, a, complete, flight, of, steps, between, two, floors, a, stair, flight, is, a, run, of, stairs, or, steps, between, landings, a, staircase, or, stairway, is, one, or, more, flights, of, stairs, leading, from, one, floor, to, another, and, includes, landings, newel, posts, handrails, balustrades, and, additional, parts, a, stairwell, is, a, compartment, extending, vertically, through, a, building, in, which, stairs, are, placed, a, stair, hall, is, the, stairs, landings, hallways, or, other, portions, of, the, public, hall, through, which, it, is, necessary, to, pass, when, going, from, the, entrance, floor, to, the, other, floors, of, a, building, box, stairs, are, stairs, built, between, walls, usually, with, no, support, except, the, wall, strings, stairs, may, be, in, a, straight, run, leading, from, one, floor, to, another, without, a, turn, or, change, in, direction, stairs, may, change, direction, commonly, by, two, straight, flights, connected, at, a, 90, angle, landing, stairs, may, also, return, onto, themselves, with, 180, angle, landings, at, each, end, of, straight, flights, forming, a, vertical, stairway, commonly, used, in, multistory, and, highrise, buildings, many, variations, of, geometrical, stairs, may, be, formed, of, circular, elliptical, and, irregular, constructions, stairs, may, be, a, required, component, of, egress, exit, paths, from, structures, and, buildings, stairs, are, also, provided, for, convenience, to, access, floors, roofs, levels, and, walking, surfaces, not, accessible, by, other, means, stairway, is, also, a, common, metaphor, for, achievement, or, loss, of, a, position, in, the, society, or, as, a, metaphor, of, hierarchy, e, g, jacob, s, ladder, battleship, potemkin, each, step, is, composed, of, a, tread, and, a, riser, some, treads, may, include, a, nosing, the, balustrade, is, the, system, of, railings, and, balusters, that, prevents, people, from, falling, over, the, edge, handrails, may, be, continuous, sometimes, called, over, the, post, or, post, to, post, or, more, accurately, newel, to, newel, for, continuous, handrails, on, long, balconies, there, may, be, multiple, newels, and, tandem, caps, to, cover, the, newels, at, corners, there, are, quarter, turn, caps, for, post, to, post, systems, the, newels, project, above, the, handrails, another, more, classical, form, of, handrailing, that, is, still, in, use, is, the, tangent, method, a, variant, of, the, cylindric, method, of, layout, it, allows, for, continuous, climbing, and, twisting, rails, and, easings, it, was, defined, from, principles, set, down, by, architect, peter, nicholson, in, the, 18th, century, the, dimensions, of, a, stair, in, particular, the, rise, height, and, going, of, the, steps, should, remain, the, same, along, the, stairs, the, following, stair, dimensions, are, important, stairs, can, take, a, large, number, of, forms, combining, straight, runs, winders, and, landings, the, simplest, form, is, the, straight, flight, of, stairs, with, neither, winders, nor, landings, these, types, of, stairs, were, commonly, used, in, traditional, homes, as, they, are, relatively, easy, to, build, and, only, need, to, be, connected, at, the, top, and, bottom, however, many, modern, architects, may, not, choose, straight, flights, of, stairs, because, another, form, of, a, straight, staircase, is, the, space, saver, staircase, also, known, as, paddle, stairs, or, alternating, tread, staircases, these, designs, can, be, used, for, a, steeper, rise, but, they, can, only, be, used, in, certain, circumstances, and, must, comply, with, regulations, however, a, basic, straight, flight, of, stairs, is, easier, to, design, and, construct, than, one, with, landings, or, winders, the, rhythm, of, stepping, is, not, interrupted, in, a, straight, run, which, may, offset, an, increased, fall, risk, by, helping, to, prevent, a, misstep, in, the, first, place, however, many, long, straight, runs, of, stairs, will, require, landings, or, winders, to, comply, with, safety, standards, in, building, regulations, straight, stairs, can, have, a, mid, landing, incorporated, but, it, is, probably, more, common, to, see, stairs, that, use, a, landing, or, winder, to, produce, a, bend, in, the, stairs, a, straight, flight, with, a, mid, landing, will, require, a, lot, of, straight, length, and, may, be, more, commonly, found, in, large, commercial, buildings, l, shaped, stairways, have, one, landing, and, usually, a, change, in, direction, by, 90, u, shaped, stairs, may, employ, a, single, wider, landing, for, a, change, in, direction, of, 180, or, two, landings, for, two, changes, in, direction, of, 90, each, a, z, shaped, staircase, incorporates, two, opposite, 90, turns, creating, a, shape, similar, to, that, of, the, letter, z, if, seen, from, above, the, use, of, landings, and, a, possible, change, of, direction, have, the, following, effects, other, forms, include, stairs, with, winders, that, curve, or, bend, at, an, acute, angle, three, flights, of, stairs, that, join, at, a, landing, to, form, a, t, shape, and, stairs, with, balconies, and, complex, designs, a, mono, string, staircase, is, a, term, used, for, a, staircase, with, treads, arranged, along, a, single, steel, beam, a, double, string, staircase, has, two, steel, beams, one, on, either, side, and, treads, spanning, between, the, term, helical, stair, has, many, synonyms, 53, the, helical, stair, is, also, called, the, spiral, stair, winding, stair, circular, stair, elliptical, stair, oval, stair, geometric, stair, vis, vice, vis, de, saint, gilles, st, gilles, screw, belfry, stair, turret, stair, caracole, turnpike, cochlea, cockle, corkscrew, and, ascensorium, helical, is, possibly, the, least, poetic, but, also, the, most, accurate, generic, title, the, term, spiral, has, a, more, narrow, definition, in, a, mathematical, context, as, a, curve, which, lies, in, a, single, plane, and, moves, towards, or, away, from, a, central, point, with, a, continuously, changing, radius, the, mathematical, term, for, the, 3, dimensional, curve, traced, where, the, locus, progresses, at, a, fixed, radius, from, a, fixed, line, while, moving, in, a, circular, motion, around, it, is, a, helix, since, the, very, purpose, of, a, stairway, is, to, change, elevation, it, is, inherently, a, 3, dimensional, path, loose, everyday, usage, conflates, the, terms, helical, and, spiral, but, the, vast, majority, of, circular, stairs, are, actually, helical, true, spiral, staircases, would, be, nonfunctional, flat, structures, although, functional, hybrid, helical, spiral, staircases, can, be, constructed, this, article, attempts, to, preferentially, use, the, terms, helix, and, helical, to, describe, circular, stairways, more, clearly, and, precisely, while, reserving, the, term, spiral, for, a, curve, restricted, to, a, flat, plane, helical, stairs, sometimes, referred, to, in, architectural, descriptions, as, vice, wind, around, a, newel, also, called, the, central, pole, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, central, pole, or, newel, does, not, affect, the, overall, terminology, applied, to, the, design, of, the, structure, in, scottish, architecture, helical, stairs, are, commonly, known, as, a, turnpike, stair, helical, stairs, typically, have, a, handrail, along, the, outer, periphery, only, and, on, the, inner, side, may, have, just, a, central, pole, a, squared, helical, stair, fills, a, square, stairwell, and, expands, the, steps, and, railing, to, a, square, resulting, in, unequal, steps, wider, and, longer, where, they, extend, into, a, corner, of, the, square, a, pure, helix, fills, a, circular, stairwell, and, has, multiple, steps, and, handrail, elements, which, are, identical, and, positioned, screw, symmetrically, helical, stairs, have, a, handedness, or, chirality, analogous, to, the, handedness, of, screw, threads, either, right, handed, or, left, handed, helical, shapes, ascending, a, right, handed, helix, rises, counter, clockwise, while, ascending, a, left, handed, helix, rises, clockwise, both, as, viewed, from, above, a, fundamental, advantage, of, helical, stairs, is, that, they, can, be, very, compact, fitting, into, very, narrow, spaces, and, occupying, a, small, footprint, 54, for, this, reason, they, can, often, be, found, in, ships, and, submarines, industrial, installations, small, loft, apartments, and, other, locations, where, floorspace, is, scarce, 81, however, this, compactness, can, come, at, the, expense, of, requiring, great, craftsmanship, and, care, to, produce, a, safe, and, effective, structure, 54, by, contrast, grand, helical, stairs, occupying, wide, sweeps, of, space, can, also, be, built, to, showcase, luxurious, funding, and, elegant, taste, 56, architects, have, used, the, twisting, curvilinear, shape, as, an, embellishment, either, within, or, outside, of, their, buildings, 58, 59, helical, stairs, have, the, disadvantage, of, being, very, steep, if, they, are, tight, small, radius, or, are, otherwise, not, supported, by, a, center, column, the, cylindrical, spaces, they, occupy, can, have, a, narrow, or, wide, diameter, open, well, helical, or, circular, stairs, designed, by, architects, often, do, not, have, a, central, pole, but, there, usually, is, a, handrail, at, both, sides, of, the, treads, these, designs, have, the, advantage, of, a, more, uniform, tread, depth, when, compared, to, a, narrow, helical, staircase, such, stairs, may, also, be, built, around, an, elliptical, or, oval, footprint, 68, 72, or, even, a, triangular, or, pentagonal, core, lacking, a, central, pole, an, open, well, staircase, is, supported, at, its, outer, periphery, or, in, some, cases, may, be, a, completely, self, supporting, and, free, standing, structure, an, example, of, perimeter, support, is, the, vatican, stairwell, or, the, gothic, stairwell, the, latter, stairwell, is, tight, because, of, its, location, where, the, diameter, must, be, small, many, helices, however, have, sufficient, width, for, normal, size, treads, 8, inches, 200, mm, by, being, supported, by, any, combination, of, a, center, pole, perimeter, supports, attaching, to, or, beneath, the, treads, and, a, helical, handrail, in, this, manner, the, treads, may, be, wide, enough, to, accommodate, low, rises, in, self, supporting, stairs, the, helix, needs, to, be, steep, to, allow, the, weight, to, distribute, safely, down, the, structure, in, the, most, vertical, manner, possible, helical, steps, with, center, columns, or, perimeter, support, do, not, have, this, limitation, building, codes, may, limit, the, use, of, helical, stairs, to, small, areas, or, secondary, usage, if, their, treads, are, not, sufficiently, wide, or, have, risers, taller, than, 9, 5, inches, 240, mm, double, helix, staircases, are, possible, with, two, independent, helical, stairs, in, the, same, vertical, space, allowing, one, person, to, ascend, and, another, to, descend, without, ever, meeting, if, they, choose, different, helices, 74, for, examples, the, pozzo, di, san, patrizio, allows, one, way, traffic, so, that, laden, and, unladen, mules, can, ascend, and, descend, without, obstruction, while, ch, teau, de, chambord, ch, teau, de, blois, and, the, cr, dit, lyonnais, headquarters, ensure, separation, for, social, purposes, emergency, exit, stairways, though, built, with, landings, and, straight, runs, of, stairs, are, often, functionally, double, helices, with, two, separate, stairs, intertwined, and, occupying, the, same, floor, footprint, this, is, often, in, compliance, with, legal, safety, requirements, to, have, two, independent, fire, escape, paths, helical, stairs, can, be, characterized, by, the, number, of, turns, that, are, made, a, quarter, turn, stair, deposits, the, person, facing, 90, from, the, starting, orientation, likewise, there, are, half, turn, three, quarters, turn, and, full, turn, stairs, a, continuous, helix, may, make, many, turns, depending, on, the, height, very, tall, multi, turn, helical, staircases, are, usually, found, in, old, stone, towers, within, fortifications, churches, and, in, lighthouses, winders, may, be, used, in, combination, with, straight, stairs, to, turn, the, direction, of, the, stairs, this, allows, for, a, large, number, of, permutations, in, designs, the, earliest, known, helical, staircases, appear, in, temple, a, in, the, greek, colony, selinunte, sicily, to, both, sides, of, the, cella, the, temple, was, constructed, around, 480, 470, bce, when, used, in, roman, architecture, helical, stairs, were, generally, restricted, to, elite, luxury, structures, they, were, then, adopted, into, christian, ecclesiastic, architecture, during, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, increasingly, spectacular, helical, stairways, were, devised, first, deleting, walled, enclosures, and, then, deleting, a, central, post, to, leave, an, open, well, 60, 74, modern, designs, have, trended, towards, minimalism, culminating, in, helical, stairs, made, largely, of, transparent, glass, or, consisting, only, of, stair, treads, with, minimal, visible, support, 67, there, is, a, common, misconception, that, helical, staircases, in, castles, rose, in, a, clockwise, direction, to, hinder, right, handed, attackers, while, clockwise, helical, staircases, are, more, common, in, castles, than, anti, clockwise, they, were, even, more, common, in, medieval, structures, without, a, military, role, such, as, religious, buildings, studies, of, helical, stairs, in, castles, have, concluded, that, the, role, and, position, of, spirals, in, castles, had, a, much, stronger, domestic, and, status, role, than, a, military, function, and, that, there, are, sufficient, examples, of, anticlockwise, stairs, in, britain, and, france, in, to, indicate, that, the, choice, must, have, depended, both, on, physical, convenience, and, architectural, practicalities, and, there, was, no, military, ideology, that, demanded, clockwise, staircases, in, the, cause, of, fighting, efficiency, or, advantage, developments, in, manufacturing, and, design, have, also, led, to, the, introduction, of, kit, form, helical, stairs, modular, standardized, steps, and, handrails, can, be, bolted, together, to, form, a, complete, unit, these, stairs, can, be, made, out, of, steel, timber, concrete, or, a, combination, of, materials, where, there, is, insufficient, space, for, the, full, run, length, of, normal, stairs, alternating, tread, stairs, may, be, used, other, names, are, paddle, stairs, zig, zag, stairs, or, double, riser, stairs, 19, alternating, tread, stairs, can, be, designed, to, allow, for, a, safe, forward, facing, descent, of, very, steep, stairs, however, designs, with, recessed, treads, or, footholds, do, not, have, this, feature, the, treads, are, designed, such, that, they, alternate, between, treads, for, each, foot, one, step, is, wide, on, the, left, side, the, next, step, is, wide, on, the, right, side, there, is, insufficient, space, on, the, narrow, portion, of, the, step, for, the, other, foot, to, stand, hence, the, person, must, always, use, the, correct, foot, on, the, correct, step, the, slope, of, alternating, tread, stairs, can, be, as, high, as, 65, as, opposed, to, standard, stairs, which, are, almost, always, less, than, 45, an, advantage, of, alternating, tread, stairs, is, that, people, can, descend, while, facing, forward, in, the, direction, of, travel, the, only, other, alternative, in, such, short, spaces, would, be, a, ladder, which, requires, a, backward, facing, descent, alternating, tread, stairs, may, not, be, safe, for, small, children, the, elderly, or, the, physically, challenged, building, codes, typically, classify, them, as, ladders, and, will, only, allow, them, where, ladders, are, allowed, usually, basement, or, attic, utility, or, storage, areas, infrequently, accessed, the, block, model, in, the, image, illustrates, the, space, efficiency, gained, by, an, alternating, tread, stair, the, alternating, stairs, 3, requires, one, unit, of, space, per, step, the, same, as, the, half, width, stairs, 2, and, half, as, much, as, the, full, width, stairs, 1, thus, the, horizontal, distance, between, steps, is, in, this, case, reduced, by, a, factor, of, two, reducing, the, size, of, each, step, the, horizontal, distance, between, steps, is, reduced, by, a, factor, less, than, two, if, for, construction, reasons, there, are, narrow, unused, step, extensions, these, stairs, often, including, this, example, illustrate, the, mathematical, principle, of, glide, plane, symmetry, the, mirror, image, with, respect, to, the, vertical, center, plane, corresponds, to, a, shift, by, one, step, alternating, tread, stairs, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, witches, stairs, in, the, supposed, belief, that, they, were, created, during, an, earlier, era, as, an, attempt, to, repel, witches, who, were, thought, to, be, unable, to, climb, such, stairs, such, a, fanciful, origin, of, the, term, has, since, been, disproved, with, experts, finding, no, mention, in, any, historical, literature, of, stairs, that, were, believed, to, prevent, access, by, witches, alternating, tread, stairs, have, been, in, use, since, at, least, 1888, today, the, design, is, used, in, some, loft, apartments, to, access, bedrooms, or, storage, spaces, local, building, codes, often, dictate, the, number, of, emergency, exits, required, for, a, building, of, a, given, size, including, specifying, a, minimum, number, of, stairwells, for, any, building, bigger, than, a, private, house, modern, codes, invariably, specify, at, least, two, sets, of, stairs, completely, isolated, from, each, other, so, that, if, one, becomes, impassable, due, to, smoke, or, flames, the, other, remains, usable, the, traditional, way, to, satisfy, this, requirement, was, to, construct, two, separate, stairwell, stacks, each, occupying, its, own, footprint, within, each, floorplate, each, stairwell, is, internally, configured, into, an, arrangement, often, called, a, u, return, or, return, design, the, two, stairwells, may, be, constructed, next, to, each, other, separated, by, a, fireproof, partition, or, optionally, the, two, stairwells, may, be, located, at, some, distance, from, each, other, within, the, floorplan, these, traditional, arrangements, have, the, advantage, of, being, easily, understood, by, building, occupants, and, occasional, visitors, some, architects, save, floor, footprint, space, while, still, meeting, the, exit, requirement, by, housing, two, stairwells, in, a, double, helix, or, scissors, stairs, configuration, whereby, two, stairwells, occupy, the, same, floor, footprint, but, are, intertwined, while, being, separated, by, fireproof, partitions, along, their, entire, run, however, this, design, deposits, anybody, descending, the, stack, into, alternating, locations, on, each, successive, floor, and, this, can, be, very, disorienting, some, building, codes, recommend, using, a, color, coded, stripe, and, signage, to, distinguish, otherwise, identical, looking, stairwells, from, each, other, and, to, make, following, a, quick, exit, path, easier, ergonomically, and, for, safety, reasons, stairs, must, have, certain, dimensions, so, that, people, can, comfortably, use, them, building, codes, typically, specify, certain, clearances, so, that, the, stairs, are, not, too, steep, or, narrow, nicolas, fran, ois, blondel, in, the, last, volume, of, his, cours, d, architecture, 1675, 1683, was, the, first, known, person, to, establish, the, ergonomic, relationship, of, tread, and, riser, dimensions, he, specified, that, 2, riser, tread, step, length, it, is, estimated, that, a, noticeable, misstep, occurs, once, in, 7, 398, uses, and, a, minor, accident, on, a, flight, of, stairs, occurs, once, in, 63, 000, uses, stairs, can, be, a, hazardous, obstacle, for, some, so, some, people, choose, to, live, in, residences, without, stairs, so, that, they, are, protected, from, injury, stairs, are, not, suitable, for, wheelchairs, and, other, vehicles, a, stairlift, is, a, mechanical, device, for, lifting, wheelchairs, up, and, down, stairs, for, sufficiently, wide, stairs, a, rail, is, mounted, to, the, treads, of, the, stairs, or, attached, to, the, wall, a, chair, is, attached, to, the, rail, and, the, person, on, the, chair, is, lifted, as, the, chair, moves, along, the, rail, overview, of, approved, document, k,

old, so, the, handrail, ballister, spacing, should, be, constructed, so, that, a, 100mm, diameter, sphere, cannot, pass, through, the, opening, in, the, risers, in, order, to, prevent, children, from,
