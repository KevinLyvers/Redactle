a, cultivator, also, known, as, a, rotavator, is, a, piece, of, agricultural, equipment, used, for, secondary, tillage, one, sense, of, the, name, refers, to, frames, with, teeth, also, called, shanks, that, pierce, the, soil, as, they, are, dragged, through, it, linearly, another, sense, of, the, name, also, refers, to, machines, that, use, the, rotary, motion, of, disks, or, teeth, to, accomplish, a, similar, result, such, as, a, rotary, tiller, cultivators, stir, and, pulverize, the, soil, either, before, planting, to, aerate, the, soil, and, prepare, a, smooth, loose, seedbed, or, after, the, crop, has, begun, growing, to, kill, weeds, controlled, disturbance, of, the, topsoil, close, to, the, crop, plants, kills, the, surrounding, weeds, by, uprooting, them, burying, their, leaves, to, disrupt, their, photosynthesis, or, a, combination, of, both, unlike, a, harrow, which, disturbs, the, entire, surface, of, the, soil, cultivators, are, designed, to, disturb, the, soil, in, careful, patterns, sparing, the, crop, plants, but, disrupting, the, weeds, cultivators, of, the, toothed, type, are, often, similar, in, form, to, chisel, plows, but, their, goals, are, different, cultivators, teeth, work, near, the, surface, usually, for, weed, control, whereas, chisel, plow, shanks, work, deep, beneath, the, surface, breaking, up, the, hardened, layer, on, top, small, toothed, cultivators, pushed, or, pulled, by, a, single, person, are, used, as, garden, tools, for, small, scale, gardening, such, as, for, the, household, s, own, use, or, for, small, market, gardens, similarly, sized, rotary, tillers, combine, the, functions, of, a, harrow, and, cultivator, into, one, multipurpose, machine, cultivators, are, usually, either, self, propelled, or, drawn, as, an, attachment, behind, either, a, two, wheel, tractor, or, four, wheel, tractor, for, two, wheel, tractors, they, are, usually, rigidly, fixed, and, powered, via, couplings, to, the, tractors, transmission, for, four, wheel, tractors, they, are, usually, attached, by, means, of, a, three, point, hitch, and, driven, by, a, power, take, off, drawbar, hookup, is, also, still, commonly, used, worldwide, draft, animal, power, is, sometimes, still, used, today, being, somewhat, common, in, developing, nations, although, rare, in, more, industrialized, economies, the, basic, idea, of, soil, scratching, for, weed, control, is, ancient, and, was, done, with, hoes, or, plough, for, millennia, before, any, larger, or, more, complex, equipment, was, developed, to, reduce, the, manual, labor, and, to, speed, the, work, the, notion, of, ganging, several, hoes, together, and, applying, draft, animal, power, to, drag, them, led, to, harrows, which, while, newer, than, the, hoe, are, still, quite, ancient, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, as, the, industrial, revolution, developed, a, proliferation, of, cultivator, designs, proceeded, these, new, cultivators, were, drawn, by, draft, animals, such, as, horses, mules, or, oxen, or, were, pushed, or, drawn, by, people, depending, on, the, need, and, expense, the, powered, rotary, hoe, was, invented, by, arthur, clifford, howard, who, in, 1912, began, experimenting, with, rotary, tillage, on, his, father, s, farm, at, gilgandra, new, south, wales, australia, initially, using, his, father, s, steam, tractor, engine, as, a, power, source, he, found, that, ground, could, be, mechanically, tilled, without, soil, packing, occurring, as, was, the, case, with, normal, ploughing, his, earliest, designs, threw, the, tilled, soil, sideways, until, he, improved, his, invention, by, designing, an, l, shaped, blade, mounted, on, widely, spaced, flanges, fixed, to, a, small, diameter, rotor, with, fellow, apprentice, everard, mccleary, he, established, a, company, to, make, his, machine, but, plans, were, interrupted, by, world, war, i, in, 1919, howard, returned, to, australia, and, resumed, his, design, work, patenting, a, design, with, 5, rotary, hoe, cultivator, blades, and, an, internal, combustion, engine, in, 1920, in, march, 1922, howard, formed, the, company, austral, auto, cultivators, pty, ltd, which, later, became, known, as, howard, auto, cultivators, it, was, based, in, northmead, a, suburb, of, sydney, from, 1927, meanwhile, in, north, america, during, the, 1910s, tractors, were, evolving, away, from, traction, engine, sized, monsters, toward, smaller, lighter, more, affordable, machines, the, fordson, tractor, especially, had, made, tractors, affordable, and, practical, for, small, and, medium, family, farms, for, the, first, time, in, history, cultivating, was, somewhat, of, an, afterthought, in, the, fordson, s, design, which, reflected, the, fact, that, even, just, bringing, practical, motorized, tractive, power, alone, to, this, market, segment, was, in, itself, a, milestone, this, left, an, opportunity, for, others, to, pursue, better, motorized, cultivating, between, 1915, and, 1920, various, inventors, and, farm, implement, companies, experimented, with, a, class, of, machines, referred, to, as, motor, cultivators, which, were, simply, modified, horse, drawn, shank, type, cultivators, with, motors, added, for, self, propulsion, this, class, of, machines, found, limited, market, success, but, by, 1921, international, harvester, had, combined, motorized, cultivating, with, the, other, tasks, of, tractors, tractive, power, and, belt, work, to, create, the, farmall, the, general, purpose, tractor, tailored, to, cultivating, that, basically, invented, the, category, of, row, crop, tractors, in, australia, by, the, 1930s, howard, was, finding, it, increasingly, difficult, to, meet, a, growing, worldwide, demand, for, exports, of, his, machines, he, travelled, to, the, united, kingdom, founding, the, company, rotary, hoes, ltd, in, east, horndon, essex, in, july, 1938, branches, of, this, new, company, subsequently, opened, in, the, united, states, of, america, south, africa, germany, france, italy, spain, brazil, malaysia, australia, and, new, zealand, it, later, became, the, holding, company, for, howard, rotavator, co, ltd, the, howard, group, of, companies, was, acquired, by, the, danish, thrige, agro, group, in, 1985, and, in, december, 2000, the, howard, group, became, a, member, of, kongskilde, industries, of, soroe, denmark, in, modern, commercial, agriculture, the, amount, of, cultivating, done, for, weed, control, has, been, greatly, reduced, via, use, of, herbicides, instead, however, herbicides, are, not, always, desirable, for, example, in, organic, farming, when, herbicidal, weed, control, was, first, widely, commercialized, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, it, played, into, that, era, s, optimistic, worldview, in, which, sciences, such, as, chemistry, would, usher, in, a, new, age, of, modernity, that, would, leave, old, fashioned, practices, such, as, weed, control, via, cultivators, in, the, dustbin, of, history, thus, herbicidal, weed, control, was, adopted, very, widely, and, in, some, cases, too, heavily, and, hastily, in, subsequent, decades, people, overcame, this, initial, imbalance, and, came, to, realize, that, herbicidal, weed, control, has, limitations, and, externalities, and, it, must, be, managed, intelligently, it, is, still, widely, used, and, probably, will, continue, to, be, indispensable, to, affordable, food, production, worldwide, for, the, foreseeable, future, but, its, wise, management, includes, seeking, alternate, methods, such, as, the, traditional, standby, of, mechanical, cultivation, where, practical, to, the, extent, that, cultivating, is, done, commercially, today, such, as, in, truck, farming, it, is, usually, powered, by, tractors, especially, row, crop, tractors, industrial, cultivators, can, vary, greatly, in, size, and, shape, from, 10, feet, 3, m, to, 80, feet, 24, m, wide, many, are, equipped, with, hydraulic, wings, that, fold, up, to, make, road, travel, easier, and, safer, different, types, are, used, for, preparation, of, fields, before, planting, and, for, the, control, of, weeds, between, row, crops, the, cultivator, may, be, an, implement, trailed, after, the, tractor, via, a, drawbar, mounted, on, the, three, point, hitch, or, mounted, on, a, frame, beneath, the, tractor, active, cultivator, implements, are, driven, by, a, power, take, off, shaft, while, most, cultivator, are, considered, a, secondary, tillage, implement, active, cultivators, are, commonly, used, for, primary, tillage, in, lighter, soils, instead, of, plowing, the, largest, versions, available, are, about, 6, m, 20, ft, wide, and, require, a, tractor, with, an, excess, of, 150, horsepower, 110, kw, pto, to, drive, them, field, cultivators, are, used, to, complete, tillage, operations, in, many, types, of, arable, crop, fields, the, main, function, of, the, field, cultivator, is, to, prepare, a, proper, seedbed, for, the, crop, to, be, planted, into, to, bury, crop, residue, in, the, soil, helping, to, warm, the, soil, before, planting, to, control, weeds, and, to, mix, and, incorporate, the, soil, to, ensure, the, growing, crop, has, enough, water, and, nutrients, to, grow, well, during, the, growing, season, the, implement, has, many, shanks, mounted, on, the, underside, of, a, metal, frame, and, small, narrow, rods, at, the, rear, of, the, machine, that, smooth, out, the, soil, surface, for, easier, travel, later, when, planting, in, most, field, cultivators, one, to, many, hydraulic, cylinders, raise, and, lower, the, implement, and, control, its, depth, the, main, function, of, the, row, crop, cultivator, is, weed, control, between, the, rows, of, an, established, crop, row, crop, cultivators, are, usually, raised, and, lowered, by, a, three, point, hitch, and, the, depth, is, controlled, by, gauge, wheels, sometimes, referred, to, as, sweep, cultivators, these, commonly, have, two, center, blades, that, cut, weeds, from, the, roots, near, the, base, of, the, crop, and, turn, over, soil, while, two, rear, sweeps, further, outward, than, the, center, blades, deal, with, the, center, of, the, row, and, can, be, anywhere, from, 1, to, 36, rows, wide, small, tilling, equipment, used, in, small, gardens, such, as, household, gardens, and, small, commercial, gardens, can, provide, both, primary, and, secondary, tillage, for, example, a, rotary, tiller, does, both, the, plowing, and, the, harrowing, preparing, a, smooth, loose, seedbed, it, does, not, provide, the, row, wise, weed, control, that, cultivator, teeth, would, for, that, task, there, are, single, person, pushable, toothed, cultivators, rotary, tillers, are, a, type, of, cultivator, they, are, popular, with, home, gardeners, who, want, large, vegetable, gardens, the, garden, may, be, tilled, a, few, times, before, planting, each, crop, rotary, tillers, may, be, rented, from, tool, rental, centers, for, single, use, applications, such, as, when, planting, grass, a, small, rotary, hoe, for, domestic, gardens, was, known, by, the, trademark, rototiller, and, another, made, by, the, howard, group, who, produced, a, range, of, rotary, tillers, was, known, as, the, rotavator
