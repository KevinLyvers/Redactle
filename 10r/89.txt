magnetic, tape, is, a, medium, for, magnetic, storage, made, of, a, thin, magnetizable, coating, on, a, long, narrow, strip, of, plastic, film, it, was, developed, in, germany, in, 1928, based, on, the, earlier, magnetic, wire, recording, from, denmark, devices, that, use, magnetic, tape, can, with, relative, ease, record, and, play, back, audio, visual, and, binary, computer, data, magnetic, tape, revolutionized, sound, recording, and, reproduction, and, broadcasting, it, allowed, radio, which, had, always, been, broadcast, live, to, be, recorded, for, later, or, repeated, airing, since, the, early, 1950s, magnetic, tape, has, been, used, with, computers, to, store, large, quantities, of, data, and, is, still, used, for, backup, purposes, magnetic, tape, begins, to, degrade, after, 10, 20, years, and, therefore, is, not, an, ideal, medium, for, long, term, archival, storage, the, exception, is, data, tape, formats, like, lto, which, are, specifically, designed, for, long, term, archiving, while, good, for, short, term, use, magnetic, tape, is, highly, prone, to, disintegration, depending, on, the, environment, this, process, may, begin, after, 10, 20, years, over, time, magnetic, tape, made, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, can, suffer, from, a, type, of, deterioration, called, sticky, shed, syndrome, it, is, caused, by, hydrolysis, of, the, binder, in, the, tape, and, can, render, the, tape, unusable, since, the, introduction, of, magnetic, tape, other, technologies, have, been, developed, that, can, perform, the, same, functions, and, therefore, replace, it, despite, this, technological, innovation, continues, as, of, 2014, sony, and, ibm, continue, to, advance, tape, capacity, magnetic, tape, was, invented, for, recording, sound, by, fritz, pfleumer, in, 1928, in, germany, because, of, escalating, political, tensions, and, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, these, developments, in, germany, were, largely, kept, secret, although, the, allies, knew, from, their, monitoring, of, nazi, radio, broadcasts, that, the, germans, had, some, new, form, of, recording, technology, its, nature, was, not, discovered, until, the, allies, acquired, german, recording, equipment, as, they, invaded, europe, at, the, end, of, the, war, it, was, only, after, the, war, that, americans, particularly, jack, mullin, john, herbert, orr, and, richard, h, ranger, were, able, to, bring, this, technology, out, of, germany, and, develop, it, into, commercially, viable, formats, bing, crosby, an, early, adopter, of, the, technology, made, a, large, investment, in, the, tape, hardware, manufacturer, ampex, a, wide, variety, of, audiotape, recorders, and, formats, have, been, developed, since, some, magnetic, tape, based, formats, include, videotape, is, magnetic, tape, used, for, storing, video, and, usually, sound, in, addition, information, stored, can, be, in, the, form, of, either, an, analog, or, digital, signal, videotape, is, used, in, both, video, tape, recorders, vtrs, and, more, commonly, videocassette, recorders, vcrs, and, camcorders, videotapes, have, also, been, used, for, storing, scientific, or, medical, data, such, as, the, data, produced, by, an, electrocardiogram, some, magnetic, tape, based, formats, include, magnetic, tape, data, storage, is, a, system, for, storing, digital, information, on, magnetic, tape, using, digital, recording, tape, was, an, important, medium, for, primary, data, storage, in, early, computers, typically, using, large, open, reels, of, 7, track, later, 9, track, tape, modern, magnetic, tape, is, most, commonly, packaged, in, cartridges, and, cassettes, such, as, the, widely, supported, linear, tape, open, lto, and, ibm, 3592, series, the, device, that, performs, the, writing, or, reading, of, data, is, called, a, tape, drive, autoloaders, and, tape, libraries, are, often, used, to, automate, cartridge, handling, and, exchange, compatibility, was, important, to, enable, transferring, data
