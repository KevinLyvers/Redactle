a, passenger, ship, is, a, merchant, ship, whose, primary, function, is, to, carry, passengers, on, the, sea, the, category, does, not, include, cargo, vessels, which, have, accommodations, for, limited, numbers, of, passengers, such, as, the, ubiquitous, twelve, passenger, freighters, once, common, on, the, seas, in, which, the, transport, of, passengers, is, secondary, to, the, carriage, of, freight, the, type, does, however, include, many, classes, of, ships, designed, to, transport, substantial, numbers, of, passengers, as, well, as, freight, indeed, until, recently, virtually, all, ocean, liners, were, able, to, transport, mail, package, freight, and, express, and, other, cargo, in, addition, to, passenger, luggage, and, were, equipped, with, cargo, holds, and, derricks, kingposts, or, other, cargo, handling, gear, for, that, purpose, only, in, more, recent, ocean, liners, and, in, virtually, all, cruise, ships, has, this, cargo, capacity, been, eliminated, while, typically, passenger, ships, are, part, of, the, merchant, marine, passenger, ships, have, also, been, used, as, troopships, and, often, are, commissioned, as, naval, ships, when, used, as, for, that, purpose, passenger, ship, types, passenger, ships, include, ferries, which, are, vessels, for, day, to, day, or, overnight, short, sea, trips, moving, passengers, and, vehicles, whether, road, or, rail, ocean, liners, which, typically, are, passenger, or, passenger, cargo, vessels, transporting, passengers, and, often, cargo, on, longer, line, voyages, and, cruise, ships, which, often, transport, passengers, on, round, trips, in, which, the, trip, itself, and, the, attractions, of, the, ship, and, ports, visited, are, the, principal, draw, there, are, several, main, types, although, some, ships, have, characteristics, of, both, types, the, design, priorities, of, the, two, forms, are, different, ocean, liners, value, speed, and, traditional, luxury, while, cruise, ships, value, amenities, swimming, pools, theaters, ball, rooms, casinos, sports, facilities, etc, rather, than, speed, these, priorities, produce, different, designs, in, addition, ocean, liners, typically, were, built, to, cross, the, atlantic, ocean, between, europe, and, the, united, states, or, travel, even, further, to, south, america, or, asia, while, cruise, ships, typically, serve, shorter, routes, with, more, stops, along, coastlines, or, among, various, islands, both, the, queen, elizabeth, 2, qe2, 1969, and, her, successor, as, cunard, s, flagship, rms, queen, mary, 2, qm2, which, entered, service, in, 2004, are, of, hybrid, construction, like, transatlantic, ocean, liners, they, are, fast, ships, and, strongly, built, to, withstand, the, rigors, of, the, north, atlantic, in, line, voyage, service, but, both, ships, are, also, designed, to, operate, as, cruise, ships, with, the, amenities, expected, in, that, trade, qm2, was, superseded, by, the, freedom, of, the, seas, of, the, royal, caribbean, line, as, the, largest, passenger, ship, ever, built, however, qm2, still, hold, the, record, for, the, largest, ocean, liner, the, freedom, of, the, seas, was, superseded, by, the, oasis, of, the, seas, in, october, 2009, because, of, changes, in, historic, measurement, systems, it, is, difficult, to, make, meaningful, and, accurate, comparisons, of, ship, sizes, historically, gross, register, tonnage, grt, was, a, measure, of, the, internal, volume, of, certain, enclosed, areas, of, a, ship, divided, into, tons, equivalent, to, 100, cubic, feet, 2, 8, m, 3, of, space, gross, tonnage, gt, is, a, comparatively, new, measure, adopted, in, 1982, to, replace, grt, it, is, calculated, based, on, the, moulded, volume, of, all, enclosed, spaces, of, the, ship, and, is, used, to, determine, things, such, as, a, ship, s, manning, regulations, safety, rules, registration, fees, and, port, dues, it, is, produced, by, a, mathematical, formula, and, does, not, distinguish, between, mechanical, and, passenger, spaces, and, thus, is, not, directly, comparable, to, historic, grt, measurements, displacement, a, measure, of, mass, is, not, commonly, used, for, passenger, vessels, while, a, high, displacement, can, indicate, better, sea, keeping, abilities, gross, tonnage, is, promoted, as, the, most, important, measure, of, size, for, passenger, vessels, as, the, ratio, of, gross, tonnage, per, passenger, the, passenger, space, ratio, gives, a, sense, of, the, spaciousness, of, a, ship, an, important, consideration, in, cruise, liners, where, the, onboard, amenities, are, of, high, importance, historically, a, ship, s, grt, and, displacement, were, somewhat, similar, in, number, for, example, titanic, put, in, service, in, 1912, had, a, grt, of, 46, 328, and, a, displacement, reported, at, over, 52, 000, tons, similarly, cunard, line, s, mid, 1930s, rms, queen, mary, and, rms, queen, elizabeth, were, of, approximately, 81, 000, 83, 000, grt, and, had, displacements, of, over, 80, 000, tons, today, due, to, changes, in, construction, engineering, function, architecture, and, crucially, measurement, system, which, measures, functionally, all, of, a, ship, s, internal, volume, not, just, part, of, it, modern, passenger, ships, gt, values, are, much, higher, than, their, displacements, the, cunard, queens, current, successor, the, 148, 528, gt, queen, mary, 2, has, been, estimated, to, only, displace, approximately, 76, 000, tons, with, the, completion, in, 2009, of, the, first, of, the, over, 225, 000, gt, oasis, class, cruise, ships, oasis, of, the, seas, passenger, ships, displacements, rose, to, 100, 000, tons, well, less, than, half, their, gt, this, new, class, is, characteristic, of, an, explosive, growth, in, gross, tonnage, which, has, more, than, doubled, from, the, largest, cruise, ships, of, the, late, 1990s, this, reflects, the, much, lower, relative, weight, of, enclosed, space, in, the, comparatively, light, superstructure, of, a, ship, versus, its, heavily, reinforced, and, machinery, laden, hull, space, as, cruise, ships, have, grown, slab, sided, vertically, from, their, maximum, beam, to, accommodate, more, passengers, within, a, given, hull, size, passenger, ships, are, subject, to, two, major, international, maritime, organization, requirements, to, perform, musters, of, the, passengers, within, 24, hours, after, their, embarkation, and, to, be, able, to, perform, full, abandonment, within, a, period, of, 30, minutes, from, the, time, the, abandon, ship, signal, is, given, transportation, research, board, research, from, 2019, reported, passenger, vessels, much, more, than, freight, vessels, are, subject, to, degradations, in, stability, as, a, result, of, increases, in, lightship, weight, passenger, vessels, appear, to, be, more, pressing, candidates, for, lightship, weight, tracking, programs, than, freight, vessels, passengers, on, ships, without, backup, generators, suffer, substantial, distress, due, to, lack, of, water, refrigeration, and, sewage, systems, in, the, event, of, loss, of, the, main, engines, or, generators, due, to, fire, or, other, emergency, power, is, also, unavailable, to, the, crew, of, the, ship, to, operate, electrically, powered, mechanisms, lack, of, an, adequate, backup, system, to, propel, the, ship, can, in, rough, seas, render, it, dead, in, the, water, and, result, in, loss, of, the, ship, the, 2006, revised, passenger, ship, safety, standards, address, these, issues, and, others, requiring, that, ships, ordered, after, july, 2010, conform, to, safe, return, to, port, regulations, however, as, of, 2013, many, ships, remain, in, service, which, lack, this, capacity, after, october, 1, 2010, the, international, convention, for, the, safety, of, life, at, sea, solas, requires, passenger, ships, operating, in, international, waters, must, either, be, constructed, or, upgraded, to, exclude, combustible, materials, it, is, believed, some, owners, and, operators, of, ships, built, before, 1980, which, are, required, to, upgrade, or, retire, their, vessels, will, be, unable, to, conform, to, the, regulations, fred, olsen, cruise, line, s, black, prince, built, in, 1966, was, one, such, ship, but, was, reported, to, be, headed, for, inter, island, service, in, venezuelan, waters, the, international, ice, patrol, was, formed, in, 1914, after, the, sinking, of, the, titanic, to, address, the, long, outstanding, issue, of, iceberg, collision, passengers, and, their, luggage, at, sea, are, covered, by, the, athens, convention
