an, electrical, grid, or, electricity, network, is, an, interconnected, network, for, electricity, delivery, from, producers, to, consumers, electrical, grids, consist, of, power, stations, electrical, substations, to, step, voltage, up, or, down, electric, power, transmission, to, carry, power, over, long, distances, and, finally, electric, power, distribution, to, customers, in, that, last, step, voltage, is, stepped, down, again, to, the, required, service, voltage, power, stations, are, typically, built, close, to, energy, sources, and, far, from, densely, populated, areas, electrical, grids, vary, in, size, and, can, cover, whole, countries, or, continents, from, small, to, large, there, are, microgrids, wide, area, synchronous, grids, and, super, grids, the, combined, transmission, and, distribution, network, is, part, of, electricity, delivery, known, as, the, power, grid, grids, are, nearly, always, synchronous, meaning, all, distribution, areas, operate, with, three, phase, alternating, current, ac, frequencies, synchronized, so, that, voltage, swings, occur, at, almost, the, same, time, this, allows, transmission, of, ac, power, throughout, the, area, connecting, the, electricity, generators, with, consumers, grids, can, enable, more, efficient, electricity, markets, although, electrical, grids, are, widespread, as, of, 2016, 1, 4, billion, people, worldwide, were, not, connected, to, an, electricity, grid, as, electrification, increases, the, number, of, people, with, access, to, grid, electricity, is, growing, about, 840, million, people, mostly, in, africa, which, is, ca, 11, of, the, world, s, population, had, no, access, to, grid, electricity, in, 2017, down, from, 1, 2, billion, in, 2010, electrical, grids, can, be, prone, to, malicious, intrusion, or, attack, thus, there, is, a, need, for, electric, grid, security, also, as, electric, grids, modernize, and, introduce, computer, technology, cyber, threats, start, to, become, a, security, risk, particular, concerns, relate, to, the, more, complex, computer, systems, needed, to, manage, grids, a, microgrid, is, a, local, grid, that, is, usually, part, of, the, regional, wide, area, synchronous, grid, but, which, can, disconnect, and, operate, autonomously, it, might, do, this, in, times, when, the, main, grid, is, affected, by, outages, this, is, known, as, islanding, and, it, might, run, indefinitely, on, its, own, resources, compared, to, larger, grids, microgrids, typically, use, a, lower, voltage, distribution, network, and, distributed, generators, microgrids, may, not, only, be, more, resilient, but, may, be, cheaper, to, implement, in, isolated, areas, a, design, goal, is, that, a, local, area, produces, all, of, the, energy, it, uses, example, implementations, include, a, wide, area, synchronous, grid, also, known, as, an, interconnection, in, north, america, directly, connects, many, generators, delivering, ac, power, with, the, same, relative, frequency, to, many, consumers, for, example, there, are, four, major, interconnections, in, north, america, the, western, interconnection, the, eastern, interconnection, the, quebec, interconnection, and, the, texas, interconnection, in, europe, one, large, grid, connects, most, of, continental, europe, a, wide, area, synchronous, grid, also, called, an, interconnection, in, north, america, is, an, electrical, grid, at, a, regional, scale, or, greater, that, operates, at, a, synchronized, frequency, and, is, electrically, tied, together, during, normal, system, conditions, these, are, also, known, as, synchronous, zones, the, largest, of, which, is, the, synchronous, grid, of, continental, europe, entso, e, with, 667, gigawatts, gw, of, generation, and, the, widest, region, served, being, that, of, the, ips, ups, system, serving, countries, of, the, former, soviet, union, synchronous, grids, with, ample, capacity, facilitate, electricity, market, trading, across, wide, areas, in, the, entso, e, in, 2008, over, 350, 000, megawatt, hours, were, sold, per, day, on, the, european, energy, exchange, eex, each, of, the, interconnects, in, north, america, are, run, at, a, nominal, 60, hz, while, those, of, europe, run, at, 50, hz, neighbouring, interconnections, with, the, same, frequency, and, standards, can, be, synchronized, and, directly, connected, to, form, a, larger, interconnection, or, they, may, share, power, without, synchronization, via, high, voltage, direct, current, power, transmission, lines, dc, ties, or, with, variable, frequency, transformers, vfts, which, permit, a, controlled, flow, of, energy, while, also, functionally, isolating, the, independent, ac, frequencies, of, each, side, the, benefits, of, synchronous, zones, include, pooling, of, generation, resulting, in, lower, generation, costs, pooling, of, load, resulting, in, significant, equalizing, effects, common, provisioning, of, reserves, resulting, in, cheaper, primary, and, secondary, reserve, power, costs, opening, of, the, market, resulting, in, possibility, of, long, term, contracts, and, short, term, power, exchanges, and, mutual, assistance, in, the, event, of, disturbances, one, disadvantage, of, a, wide, area, synchronous, grid, is, that, problems, in, one, part, can, have, repercussions, across, the, whole, grid, for, example, in, 2018, kosovo, used, more, power, than, it, generated, due, to, a, dispute, with, serbia, leading, to, the, phase, across, the, whole, synchronous, grid, of, continental, europe, lagging, behind, what, it, should, have, been, the, frequency, dropped, to, 49, 996, hz, this, caused, certain, kinds, of, clocks, to, become, six, minutes, slow, a, super, grid, or, supergrid, is, a, wide, area, transmission, network, that, is, intended, to, make, possible, the, trade, of, high, volumes, of, electricity, across, great, distances, it, is, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, a, mega, grid, super, grids, can, support, a, global, energy, transition, by, smoothing, local, fluctuations, of, wind, energy, and, solar, energy, in, this, context, they, are, considered, as, a, key, technology, to, mitigate, global, warming, super, grids, typically, use, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, to, transmit, electricity, long, distances, the, latest, generation, of, hvdc, power, lines, can, transmit, energy, with, losses, of, only, 1, 6, per, 1000, km, electric, utilities, between, regions, are, many, times, interconnected, for, improved, economy, and, reliability, electrical, interconnectors, allow, for, economies, of, scale, allowing, energy, to, be, purchased, from, large, efficient, sources, utilities, can, draw, power, from, generator, reserves, from, a, different, region, to, ensure, continuing, reliable, power, and, diversify, their, loads, interconnection, also, allows, regions, to, have, access, to, cheap, bulk, energy, by, receiving, power, from, different, sources, for, example, one, region, may, be, producing, cheap, hydro, power, during, high, water, seasons, but, in, low, water, seasons, another, area, may, be, producing, cheaper, power, through, wind, allowing, both, regions, to, access, cheaper, energy, sources, from, one, another, during, different, times, of, the, year, neighboring, utilities, also, help, others, to, maintain, the, overall, system, frequency, and, also, help, manage, tie, transfers, between, utility, regions, electricity, interconnection, level, eil, of, a, grid, is, the, ratio, of, the, total, interconnector, power, to, the, grid, divided, by, the, installed, production, capacity, of, the, grid, within, the, eu, it, has, set, a, target, of, national, grids, reaching, 10, by, 2020, and, 15, by, 2030, electricity, generation, is, the, process, of, generating, electric, power, from, sources, of, primary, energy, typically, at, power, stations, usually, this, is, done, with, electromechanical, generators, driven, by, heat, engines, or, the, kinetic, energy, of, water, or, wind, other, energy, sources, include, solar, photovoltaics, and, geothermal, power, the, sum, of, the, power, outputs, of, generators, on, the, grid, is, the, production, of, the, grid, typically, measured, in, gigawatts, gw, electric, power, transmission, is, the, bulk, movement, of, electrical, energy, from, a, generating, site, via, a, web, of, interconnected, lines, to, an, electrical, substation, from, which, is, connected, to, the, distribution, system, this, networked, system, of, connections, is, distinct, from, the, local, wiring, between, high, voltage, substations, and, customers, transmission, networks, are, complex, with, redundant, pathways, redundancy, allows, line, failures, to, occur, and, power, is, simply, rerouted, while, repairs, are, done, because, the, power, is, often, generated, far, from, where, it, is, consumed, the, transmission, system, can, cover, great, distances, for, a, given, amount, of, power, transmission, efficiency, is, greater, at, higher, voltages, and, lower, currents, therefore, voltages, are, stepped, up, at, the, generating, station, and, stepped, down, at, local, substations, for, distribution, to, customers, most, transmission, is, three, phase, three, phase, compared, to, single, phase, can, deliver, much, more, power, for, a, given, amount, of, wire, since, the, neutral, and, ground, wires, are, shared, further, three, phase, generators, and, motors, are, more, efficient, than, their, single, phase, counterparts, however, for, conventional, conductors, one, of, the, main, losses, are, resistive, losses, which, are, a, square, law, on, current, and, depend, on, distance, high, voltage, ac, transmission, lines, can, lose, 1, 4, per, hundred, miles, however, high, voltage, direct, current, can, have, half, the, losses, of, ac, over, very, long, distances, these, efficiencies, can, offset, the, additional, cost, of, the, required, ac, dc, converter, stations, at, each, end, substations, may, perform, many, different, functions, but, usually, transform, voltage, from, low, to, high, step, up, and, from, high, to, low, step, down, between, the, generator, and, the, final, consumer, the, voltage, may, be, transformed, several, times, the, three, main, types, of, substations, by, function, are, aside, from, transformers, other, major, components, or, functions, of, substations, include, distribution, is, the, final, stage, in, the, delivery, of, power, it, carries, electricity, from, the, transmission, system, to, individual, consumers, substations, connect, to, the, transmission, system, and, lower, the, transmission, voltage, to, medium, voltage, ranging, between, 2, kv, and, 35, kv, primary, distribution, lines, carry, this, medium, voltage, power, to, distribution, transformers, located, near, the, customer, s, premises, distribution, transformers, again, lower, the, voltage, to, the, utilization, voltage, customers, demanding, a, much, larger, amount, of, power, may, be, connected, directly, to, the, primary, distribution, level, or, the, subtransmission, level, distribution, networks, are, divided, into, two, types, radial, or, network, in, cities, and, towns, of, north, america, the, grid, tends, to, follow, the, classic, radially, fed, design, a, substation, receives, its, power, from, the, transmission, network, the, power, is, stepped, down, with, a, transformer, and, sent, to, a, bus, from, which, feeders, fan, out, in, all, directions, across, the, countryside, these, feeders, carry, three, phase, power, and, tend, to, follow, the, major, streets, near, the, substation, as, the, distance, from, the, substation, grows, the, fanout, continues, as, smaller, laterals, spread, out, to, cover, areas, missed, by, the, feeders, this, tree, like, structure, grows, outward, from, the, substation, but, for, reliability, reasons, usually, contains, at, least, one, unused, backup, connection, to, a, nearby, substation, this, connection, can, be, enabled, in, case, of, an, emergency, so, that, a, portion, of, a, substation, s, service, territory, can, be, alternatively, fed, by, another, substation, grid, energy, storage, also, called, large, scale, energy, storage, is, a, collection, of, methods, used, for, energy, storage, on, a, large, scale, within, an, electrical, power, grid, electrical, energy, is, stored, during, times, when, electricity, is, plentiful, and, inexpensive, especially, from, intermittent, power, sources, such, as, renewable, electricity, from, wind, power, tidal, power, and, solar, power, or, when, demand, is, low, and, later, returned, to, the, grid, when, demand, is, high, and, electricity, prices, tend, to, be, higher, as, of, 2020, the, largest, form, of, grid, energy, storage, is, dammed, hydroelectricity, with, both, conventional, hydroelectric, generation, as, well, as, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, developments, in, battery, storage, have, enabled, commercially, viable, projects, to, store, energy, during, peak, production, and, release, during, peak, demand, and, for, use, when, production, unexpectedly, falls, giving, time, for, slower, responding, resources, to, be, brought, online, two, alternatives, to, grid, storage, are, the, use, of, peaking, power, plants, to, fill, in, supply, gaps, and, demand, response, to, shift, load, to, other, times, the, demand, or, load, on, an, electrical, grid, is, the, total, electrical, power, being, removed, by, the, users, of, the, grid, the, graph, of, the, demand, over, time, is, called, the, demand, curve, baseload, is, the, minimum, load, on, the, grid, over, any, given, period, peak, demand, is, the, maximum, load, historically, baseload, was, commonly, met, by, equipment, that, was, relatively, cheap, to, run, that, ran, continuously, for, weeks, or, months, at, a, time, but, globally, this, is, becoming, less, common, the, extra, peak, demand, requirements, are, sometimes, produced, by, expensive, peaking, plants, that, are, generators, optimised, to, come, on, line, quickly, but, these, too, are, becoming, less, common, however, if, the, demand, of, electricity, exceed, the, capacity, of, a, local, power, grid, it, will, cause, safety, issue, like, burning, out, grids, are, designed, to, supply, electricity, to, their, customers, at, largely, constant, voltages, this, has, to, be, achieved, with, varying, demand, variable, reactive, loads, and, even, nonlinear, loads, with, electricity, provided, by, generators, and, distribution, and, transmission, equipment, that, are, not, perfectly, reliable, often, grids, use, tap, changers, on, transformers, near, to, the, consumers, to, adjust, the, voltage, and, keep, it, within, specification, in, a, synchronous, grid, all, the, generators, must, run, at, the, same, frequency, and, must, stay, very, nearly, in, phase, with, each, other, and, the, grid, generation, and, consumption, must, be, balanced, across, the, entire, grid, because, energy, is, consumed, as, it, is, produced, for, rotating, generators, a, local, governor, regulates, the, driving, torque, maintaining, almost, constant, rotation, speed, as, loading, changes, energy, is, stored, in, the, immediate, short, term, by, the, rotational, kinetic, energy, of, the, generators, although, the, speed, is, kept, largely, constant, small, deviations, from, the, nominal, system, frequency, are, very, important, in, regulating, individual, generators, and, are, used, as, a, way, of, assessing, the, equilibrium, of, the, grid, as, a, whole, when, the, grid, is, lightly, loaded, the, grid, frequency, runs, above, the, nominal, frequency, and, this, is, taken, as, an, indication, by, automatic, generation, control, systems, across, the, network, that, generators, should, reduce, their, output, conversely, when, the, grid, is, heavily, loaded, the, frequency, naturally, slows, and, governors, adjust, their, generators, so, that, more, power, is, output, droop, speed, control, when, generators, have, identical, droop, speed, control, settings, it, ensures, that, multiple, parallel, generators, with, the, same, settings, share, load, in, proportion, to, their, rating, in, addition, there, s, often, central, control, which, can, change, the, parameters, of, the, agc, systems, over, timescales, of, a, minute, or, longer, to, further, adjust, the, regional, network, flows, and, the, operating, frequency, of, the, grid, for, timekeeping, purposes, the, nominal, frequency, will, be, allowed, to, vary, in, the, short, term, but, is, adjusted, to, prevent, line, operated, clocks, from, gaining, or, losing, significant, time, over, the, course, of, a, whole, 24, hour, period, an, entire, synchronous, grid, runs, at, the, same, frequency, neighbouring, grids, would, not, be, synchronised, even, if, they, run, at, the, same, nominal, frequency, high, voltage, direct, current, lines, or, variable, frequency, transformers, can, be, used, to, connect, two, alternating, current, interconnection, networks, which, are, not, synchronized, with, each, other, this, provides, the, benefit, of, interconnection, without, the, need, to, synchronize, an, even, wider, area, for, example, compare, the, wide, area, synchronous, grid, map, of, europe, with, the, map, of, hvdc, lines, the, sum, of, the, maximum, power, outputs, nameplate, capacity, of, the, generators, attached, to, an, electrical, grid, might, be, considered, to, be, the, capacity, of, the, grid, however, in, practice, they, are, never, run, flat, out, simultaneously, typically, some, generators, are, kept, running, at, lower, output, powers, spinning, reserve, to, deal, with, failures, as, well, as, variation, in, demand, in, addition, generators, can, be, off, line, for, maintenance, or, other, reasons, such, as, availability, of, energy, inputs, fuel, water, wind, sun, etc, or, pollution, constraints, firm, capacity, is, the, maximum, power, output, on, a, grid, that, is, immediately, available, over, a, given, time, period, and, is, a, far, more, useful, figure, most, grid, codes, specify, that, the, load, is, shared, between, the, generators, in, merit, order, according, to, their, marginal, cost, i, e, cheapest, first, and, sometimes, their, environmental, impact, thus, cheap, electricity, providers, tend, to, be, run, flat, out, almost, all, the, time, and, the, more, expensive, producers, are, only, run, when, necessary, failures, are, usually, associated, with, generators, or, power, transmission, lines, tripping, circuit, breakers, due, to, faults, leading, to, a, loss, of, generation, capacity, for, customers, or, excess, demand, this, will, often, cause, the, frequency, to, reduce, and, the, remaining, generators, will, react, and, together, attempt, to, stabilize, above, the, minimum, if, that, is, not, possible, then, a, number, of, scenarios, can, occur, a, large, failure, in, one, part, of, the, grid, unless, quickly, compensated, for, can, cause, current, to, re, route, itself, to, flow, from, the, remaining, generators, to, consumers, over, transmission, lines, of, insufficient, capacity, causing, further, failures, one, downside, to, a, widely, connected, grid, is, thus, the, possibility, of, cascading, failure, and, widespread, power, outage, a, central, authority, is, usually, designated, to, facilitate, communication, and, develop, protocols, to, maintain, a, stable, grid, for, example, the, north, american, electric, reliability, corporation, gained, binding, powers, in, the, united, states, in, 2006, and, has, advisory, powers, in, the, applicable, parts, of, canada, and, mexico, the, u, s, government, has, also, designated, national, interest, electric, transmission, corridors, where, it, believes, transmission, bottlenecks, have, developed, a, brownout, is, an, intentional, or, unintentional, drop, in, voltage, in, an, electrical, power, supply, system, intentional, brownouts, are, used, for, load, reduction, in, an, emergency, the, reduction, lasts, for, minutes, or, hours, as, opposed, to, short, term, voltage, sag, or, dip, the, term, brownout, comes, from, the, dimming, experienced, by, incandescent, lighting, when, the, voltage, sags, a, voltage, reduction, may, be, an, effect, of, disruption, of, an, electrical, grid, or, may, occasionally, be, imposed, in, an, effort, to, reduce, load, and, prevent, a, power, outage, known, as, a, blackout, a, power, outage, also, called, a, power, cut, a, power, out, a, power, blackout, power, failure, or, a, blackout, is, a, loss, of, the, electric, power, to, a, particular, area, power, failures, can, be, caused, by, faults, at, power, stations, damage, to, electric, transmission, lines, substations, or, other, parts, of, the, distribution, system, a, short, circuit, cascading, failure, fuse, or, circuit, breaker, operation, and, human, error, power, failures, are, particularly, critical, at, sites, where, the, environment, and, public, safety, are, at, risk, institutions, such, as, hospitals, sewage, treatment, plants, mines, shelters, and, the, like, will, usually, have, backup, power, sources, such, as, standby, generators, which, will, automatically, start, up, when, electrical, power, is, lost, other, critical, systems, such, as, telecommunication, are, also, required, to, have, emergency, power, the, battery, room, of, a, telephone, exchange, usually, has, arrays, of, lead, acid, batteries, for, backup, and, also, a, socket, for, connecting, a, generator, during, extended, periods, of, outage, electrical, generation, and, transmission, systems, may, not, always, meet, peak, demand, requirements, the, greatest, amount, of, electricity, required, by, all, utility, customers, within, a, given, region, in, these, situations, overall, demand, must, be, lowered, either, by, turning, off, service, to, some, devices, or, cutting, back, the, supply, voltage, brownouts, in, order, to, prevent, uncontrolled, service, disruptions, such, as, power, outages, widespread, blackouts, or, equipment, damage, utilities, may, impose, load, shedding, on, service, areas, via, targeted, blackouts, rolling, blackouts, or, by, agreements, with, specific, high, use, industrial, consumers, to, turn, off, equipment, at, times, of, system, wide, peak, demand, a, black, start, is, the, process, of, restoring, an, electric, power, station, or, a, part, of, an, electric, grid, to, operation, without, relying, on, the, external, electric, power, transmission, network, to, recover, from, a, total, or, partial, shutdown, normally, the, electric, power, used, within, the, plant, is, provided, from, the, station, s, own, generators, if, all, of, the, plant, s, main, generators, are, shut, down, station, service, power, is, provided, by, drawing, power, from, the, grid, through, the, plant, s, transmission, line, however, during, a, wide, area, outage, off, site, power, from, the, grid, is, not, available, in, the, absence, of, grid, power, a, so, called, black, start, needs, to, be, performed, to, bootstrap, the, power, grid, into, operation, to, provide, a, black, start, some, power, stations, have, small, diesel, generators, normally, called, the, black, start, diesel, generator, bsdg, which, can, be, used, to, start, larger, generators, of, several, megawatts, capacity, which, in, turn, can, be, used, to, start, the, main, power, station, generators, generating, plants, using, steam, turbines, require, station, service, power, of, up, to, 10, of, their, capacity, for, boiler, feedwater, pumps, boiler, forced, draft, combustion, air, blowers, and, for, fuel, preparation, it, is, uneconomical, to, provide, such, a, large, standby, capacity, at, each, station, so, black, start, power, must, be, provided, over, designated, tie, lines, from, another, station, often, hydroelectric, power, plants, are, designated, as, the, black, start, sources, to, restore, network, interconnections, a, hydroelectric, station, needs, very, little, initial, power, to, start, just, enough, to, open, the, intake, gates, and, provide, excitation, current, to, the, generator, field, coils, and, can, put, a, large, block, of, power, on, line, very, quickly, to, allow, start, up, of, fossil, fuel, or, nuclear, stations, certain, types, of, combustion, turbine, can, be, configured, for, black, start, providing, another, option, in, places, without, suitable, hydroelectric, plants, in, 2017, a, utility, in, southern, california, has, successfully, demonstrated, the, use, of, a, battery, energy, storage, system, to, provide, a, black, start, firing, up, a, combined, cycle, gas, turbine, from, an, idle, state, despite, novel, institutional, arrangements, and, network, designs, power, delivery, infrastructures, is, experiencing, aging, across, the, developed, world, contributing, factors, include, demand, response, is, a, grid, management, technique, where, retail, or, wholesale, customers, are, requested, or, incentivised, either, electronically, or, manually, to, reduce, their, load, currently, transmission, grid, operators, use, demand, response, to, request, load, reduction, from, major, energy, users, such, as, industrial, plants, technologies, such, as, smart, metering, can, encourage, customers, to, use, power, when, electricity, is, plentiful, by, allowing, for, variable, pricing, the, smart, grid, is, an, enhancement, of, the, 20th, century, electrical, grid, using, two, way, communications, and, distributed, so, called, intelligent, devices, two, way, flows, of, electricity, and, information, could, improve, the, delivery, network, research, is, mainly, focused, on, three, systems, of, a, smart, grid, the, infrastructure, system, the, management, system, and, the, protection, system, electronic, power, conditioning, and, control, of, the, production, and, distribution, of, electricity, are, important, aspects, of, the, smart, grid, the, smart, grid, represents, the, full, suite, of, current, and, proposed, responses, to, the, challenges, of, electricity, supply, numerous, contributions, to, the, overall, improvement, of, the, efficiency, of, energy, infrastructure, are, anticipated, from, the, deployment, of, smart, grid, technology, in, particular, including, demand, side, management, the, improved, flexibility, of, the, smart, grid, permits, greater, penetration, of, highly, variable, renewable, energy, sources, such, as, solar, power, and, wind, power, even, without, the, addition, of, energy, storage, smart, grids, could, also, monitor, control, residential, devices, that, are, noncritical, during, periods, of, peak, power, consumption, and, return, their, function, during, nonpeak, hours, a, smart, grid, includes, a, variety, of, operation, and, energy, measures, concerns, with, smart, grid, technology, mostly, focus, on, smart, meters, items, enabled, by, them, and, general, security, issues, roll, out, of, smart, grid, technology, also, implies, a, fundamental, re, engineering, of, the, electricity, services, industry, although, typical, usage, of, the, term, is, focused, on, the, technical, infrastructure, resistance, to, distributed, generation, among, grid, operators, may, encourage, providers, to, leave, the, grid, and, instead, distribute, power, to, smaller, geographies, the, rocky, mountain, institute, and, other, studies, foresee, widescale, grid, defection, however, grid, defection, may, be, less, likely, in, places, such, as, germany, that, have, greater, power, demands, in, winter, early, electric, energy, was, produced, near, the, device, or, service, requiring, that, energy, in, the, 1880s, electricity, competed, with, steam, hydraulics, and, especially, coal, gas, coal, gas, was, first, produced, on, customer, s, premises, but, later, evolved, into, gasification, plants, that, enjoyed, economies, of, scale, in, the, industrialized, world, cities, had, networks, of, piped, gas, used, for, lighting, but, gas, lamps, produced, poor, light, wasted, heat, made, rooms, hot, and, smokey, and, gave, off, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, they, also, posed, a, fire, hazard, in, the, 1880s, electric, lighting, soon, became, advantageous, compared, to, gas, lighting, electric, utility, companies, established, central, stations, to, take, advantage, of, economies, of, scale, and, moved, to, centralized, power, generation, distribution, and, system, management, after, the, war, of, the, currents, was, settled, in, favor, of, ac, power, with, long, distance, power, transmission, it, became, possible, to, interconnect, stations, to, balance, the, loads, and, improve, load, factors, historically, transmission, and, distribution, lines, were, owned, by, the, same, company, but, starting, in, the, 1990s, many, countries, have, liberalized, the, regulation, of, the, electricity, market, in, ways, that, have, led, to, the, separation, of, the, electricity, transmission, business, from, the, distribution, business, in, the, united, kingdom, charles, merz, of, the, merz, mclellan, consulting, partnership, built, the, neptune, bank, power, station, near, newcastle, upon, tyne, in, 1901, and, by, 1912, had, developed, into, the, largest, integrated, power, system, in, europe, merz, was, appointed, head, of, a, parliamentary, committee, and, his, findings, led, to, the, williamson, report, of, 1918, which, in, turn, created, the, electricity, supply, act, 1919, the, bill, was, the, first, step, towards, an, integrated, electricity, system, the, electricity, supply, act, 1926, led, to, the, setting, up, of, the, national, grid, the, central, electricity, board, standardized, the, nation, s, electricity, supply, and, established, the, first, synchronized, ac, grid, running, at, 132, kilovolts, and, 50, hertz, this, started, operating, as, a, national, system, the, national, grid, in, 1938, in, france, electrification, began, in, the, 1900s, with, 700, communes, in, 1919, and, 36, 528, in, 1938, at, the, same, time, these, close, networks, began, to, interconnect, paris, in, 1907, at, 12, kv, the, pyr, n, es, in, 1923, at, 150, kv, and, finally, almost, all, of, the, country, interconnected, by, 1938, at, 220, kv, in, 1946, the, grid, was, the, world, s, most, dense, that, year, the, state, nationalised, the, industry, by, uniting, the, private, companies, as, lectricit, de, france, the, frequency, was, standardised, at, 50, hz, and, the, 225, kv, network, replaced, 110, kv, and, 120, kv, since, 1956, service, voltage, has, been, standardised, at, 220, 380, v, replacing, the, previous, 127, 220, v, during, the, 1970s, the, 400, kv, network, the, new, european, standard, was, implemented, the, end, user, service, voltage, will, progressively, change, to, 230, 400, v, 10, since, may, 29, 1986, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1920s, utilities, formed, joint, operations, to, share, peak, load, coverage, and, backup, power, in, 1934, with, the, passage, of, the, public, utility, holding, company, act, usa, electric, utilities, were, recognized, as, public, goods, of, importance, and, were, given, outlined, restrictions, and, regulatory, oversight, of, their, operations, the, energy, policy, act, of, 1992, required, transmission, line, owners, to, allow, electric, generation, companies, open, access, to, their, network, and, led, to, a, restructuring, of, how, the, electric, industry, operated, in, an, effort, to, create, competition, in, power, generation, no, longer, were, electric, utilities, built, as, vertical, monopolies, where, generation, transmission, and, distribution, were, handled, by, a, single, company, now, the, three, stages, could, be, split, among, various, companies, in, an, effort, to, provide, fair, access, to, high, voltage, transmission, the, energy, policy, act, of, 2005, allowed, incentives, and, loan, guarantees, for, alternative, energy, production, and, advance, innovative, technologies, that, avoided, greenhouse, emissions, in, china, electrification, began, in, the, 1950s, in, august, 1961, the, electrification, of, the, baoji, fengzhou, section, of, the, baocheng, railway, was, completed, and, delivered, for, operation, becoming, china, s, first, electrified, railway, from, 1958, to, 1998, china, s, electrified, railway, reached, 6, 200, miles, 10, 000, kilometres, as, of, the, end, of, 2017, this, number, has, reached, 54, 000, miles, 87, 000, kilometres, in, the, current, railway, electrification, system, of, china, state, grid, corporation, of, china, archived, 2021, 12, 21, at, the, wayback, machine, is, an, important, power, supplier, in, 2019, it, completed, the, power, supply, project, of, china, s, important, electrified, railways, in, its, operating, areas, such, as, jingtong, railway, haoji, railway, zhengzhou, wanzhou, high, speed, railway, et, cetera, providing, power, supply, guarantee, for, 110, traction, stations, and, its, cumulative, power, line, construction, length, reached, 6, 586, kilometres
