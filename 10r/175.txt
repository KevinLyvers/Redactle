a, landfill, is, a, site, for, the, disposal, of, waste, materials, it, is, the, oldest, and, most, common, form, of, waste, disposal, although, the, systematic, burial, of, waste, with, daily, intermediate, and, final, covers, only, began, in, the, 1940s, in, the, past, waste, was, simply, left, in, piles, or, thrown, into, pits, known, in, archeology, as, middens, some, landfill, sites, are, used, for, waste, management, purposes, such, as, temporary, storage, consolidation, and, transfer, or, for, various, stages, of, processing, waste, material, such, as, sorting, treatment, or, recycling, unless, they, are, stabilized, landfills, may, undergo, severe, shaking, or, soil, liquefaction, of, the, ground, during, an, earthquake, once, full, the, area, over, a, landfill, site, may, be, reclaimed, for, other, uses, operators, of, well, run, landfills, for, non, hazardous, waste, meet, predefined, specifications, by, applying, techniques, to, they, can, also, cover, waste, usually, daily, with, layers, of, soil, or, other, types, of, material, such, as, woodchips, and, fine, particles, during, landfill, operations, a, scale, or, weighbridge, may, weigh, waste, collection, vehicles, on, arrival, and, personnel, may, inspect, loads, for, wastes, that, do, not, accord, with, the, landfill, s, waste, acceptance, criteria, afterward, the, waste, collection, vehicles, use, the, existing, road, network, on, their, way, to, the, tipping, face, or, working, front, where, they, unload, their, contents, after, loads, are, deposited, compactors, or, bulldozers, can, spread, and, compact, the, waste, on, the, working, face, before, leaving, the, landfill, boundaries, the, waste, collection, vehicles, may, pass, through, a, wheel, cleaning, facility, if, necessary, they, return, to, the, weighbridge, for, re, weighing, without, their, load, the, weighing, process, can, assemble, statistics, on, the, daily, incoming, waste, tonnage, which, databases, can, retain, for, record, keeping, in, addition, to, trucks, some, landfills, may, have, equipment, to, handle, railroad, containers, the, use, of, rail, haul, permits, landfills, to, be, located, at, more, remote, sites, without, the, problems, associated, with, many, truck, trips, typically, in, the, working, face, the, compacted, waste, is, covered, with, soil, or, alternative, materials, daily, alternative, waste, cover, materials, include, chipped, wood, or, other, green, waste, several, sprayed, on, foam, products, chemically, fixed, bio, solids, and, temporary, blankets, blankets, can, be, lifted, into, place, at, night, and, then, removed, the, following, day, prior, to, waste, placement, the, space, that, is, occupied, daily, by, the, compacted, waste, and, the, cover, material, is, called, a, daily, cell, waste, compaction, is, critical, to, extending, the, life, of, the, landfill, factors, such, as, waste, compressibility, waste, layer, thickness, and, the, number, of, passes, of, the, compactor, over, the, waste, affect, the, waste, densities, the, term, landfill, is, usually, shorthand, for, a, municipal, landfill, or, sanitary, landfill, these, facilities, were, first, introduced, early, in, the, 20th, century, but, gained, wide, use, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, an, effort, to, eliminate, open, dumps, and, other, unsanitary, waste, disposal, practices, the, sanitary, landfill, is, an, engineered, facility, that, separates, and, confines, waste, sanitary, landfills, are, intended, as, biological, reactors, bioreactors, in, which, microbes, will, break, down, complex, organic, waste, into, simpler, less, toxic, compounds, over, time, these, reactors, must, be, designed, and, operated, according, to, regulatory, standards, and, guidelines, see, environmental, engineering, usually, aerobic, decomposition, is, the, first, stage, by, which, wastes, are, broken, down, in, a, landfill, these, are, followed, by, four, stages, of, anaerobic, degradation, usually, solid, organic, material, in, solid, phase, decays, rapidly, as, larger, organic, molecules, degrade, into, smaller, molecules, these, smaller, organic, molecules, begin, to, dissolve, and, move, to, the, liquid, phase, followed, by, hydrolysis, of, these, organic, molecules, and, the, hydrolyzed, compounds, then, undergo, transformation, and, volatilization, as, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, methane, ch, 4, with, rest, of, the, waste, remaining, in, solid, and, liquid, phases, during, the, early, phases, little, material, volume, reaches, the, leachate, as, the, biodegradable, organic, matter, of, the, waste, undergoes, a, rapid, decrease, in, volume, meanwhile, the, leachate, s, chemical, oxygen, demand, increases, with, increasing, concentrations, of, the, more, recalcitrant, compounds, compared, to, the, more, reactive, compounds, in, the, leachate, successful, conversion, and, stabilization, of, the, waste, depend, on, how, well, microbial, populations, function, in, syntrophy, i, e, an, interaction, of, different, populations, to, provide, each, other, s, nutritional, needs, the, life, cycle, of, a, municipal, landfill, undergoes, five, distinct, phases, as, the, waste, is, placed, in, the, landfill, the, void, spaces, contain, high, volumes, of, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, with, added, and, compacted, wastes, the, o, 2, content, of, the, landfill, bioreactor, strata, gradually, decreases, microbial, populations, grow, density, increases, aerobic, biodegradation, dominates, i, e, the, primary, electron, acceptor, is, o, 2, the, o, 2, is, rapidly, degraded, by, the, existing, microbial, populations, the, decreasing, o, 2, leads, to, less, aerobic, and, more, anaerobic, conditions, in, the, layers, the, primary, electron, acceptors, during, transition, are, nitrates, and, sulphates, since, o, 2, is, rapidly, displaced, by, co, 2, in, the, effluent, gas, hydrolysis, of, the, biodegradable, fraction, of, the, solid, waste, begins, in, the, acid, formation, phase, which, leads, to, rapid, accumulation, of, volatile, fatty, acids, vfas, in, the, leachate, the, increased, organic, acid, content, decreases, the, leachate, ph, from, approximately, 7, 5, to, 5, 6, during, this, phase, the, decomposition, intermediate, compounds, like, the, vfas, contribute, much, chemical, oxygen, demand, cod, long, chain, volatile, organic, acids, voas, are, converted, to, acetic, acid, c, 2, h, 4, o, 2, co, 2, and, hydrogen, gas, h, 2, high, concentrations, of, vfas, increase, both, the, biochemical, oxygen, demand, bod, and, voa, concentrations, which, initiates, h, 2, production, by, fermentative, bacteria, which, stimulates, the, growth, of, h, 2, oxidizing, bacteria, the, h, 2, generation, phase, is, relatively, short, because, it, is, complete, by, the, end, of, the, acid, formation, phase, the, increase, in, the, biomass, of, acidogenic, bacteria, increases, the, amount, of, degradation, of, the, waste, material, and, consuming, nutrients, metals, which, are, generally, more, water, soluble, at, lower, ph, may, become, more, mobile, during, this, phase, leading, to, increasing, metal, concentrations, in, the, leachate, the, acid, formation, phase, intermediary, products, e, g, acetic, propionic, and, butyric, acids, are, converted, to, ch, 4, and, co, 2, by, methanogenic, microorganisms, as, vfas, are, metabolized, by, the, methanogens, the, landfill, water, ph, returns, to, neutrality, the, leachate, s, organic, strength, expressed, as, oxygen, demand, decreases, at, a, rapid, rate, with, increases, in, ch, 4, and, co, 2, gas, production, this, is, the, longest, decomposition, phase, the, rate, of, microbiological, activity, slows, during, the, last, phase, of, waste, decomposition, as, the, supply, of, nutrients, limits, the, chemical, reactions, e, g, as, bioavailable, phosphorus, becomes, increasingly, scarce, ch, 4, production, almost, completely, disappears, with, o, 2, and, oxidized, species, gradually, reappearing, in, the, gas, wells, as, o, 2, permeates, downwardly, from, the, troposphere, this, transforms, the, oxidation, reduction, potential, orp, in, the, leachate, toward, oxidative, processes, the, residual, organic, materials, may, incrementally, be, converted, to, the, gas, phase, and, as, organic, matter, is, composted, i, e, the, organic, matter, is, converted, to, humic, like, compounds, landfills, have, the, potential, to, cause, a, number, of, issues, infrastructure, disruption, such, as, damage, to, access, roads, by, heavy, vehicles, may, occur, pollution, of, local, roads, and, watercourses, from, wheels, on, vehicles, when, they, leave, the, landfill, can, be, significant, and, can, be, mitigated, by, wheel, washing, systems, pollution, of, the, local, environment, such, as, contamination, of, groundwater, or, aquifers, or, soil, contamination, may, occur, as, well, when, precipitation, falls, on, open, landfills, water, percolates, through, the, garbage, and, becomes, contaminated, with, suspended, and, dissolved, material, forming, leachate, if, this, is, not, contained, it, can, contaminate, groundwater, all, modern, landfill, sites, use, a, combination, of, impermeable, liners, several, metres, thick, geologically, stable, sites, and, collection, systems, to, contain, and, capture, this, leachate, it, can, then, be, treated, and, evaporated, once, a, landfill, site, is, full, it, is, sealed, off, to, prevent, precipitation, ingress, and, new, leachate, formation, however, liners, must, have, a, lifespan, be, it, several, hundred, years, or, more, eventually, any, landfill, liner, could, leak, so, the, ground, around, landfills, must, be, tested, for, leachate, to, prevent, pollutants, from, contaminating, groundwater, rotting, food, and, other, decaying, organic, waste, create, decomposition, gases, especially, co, 2, and, ch, 4, from, aerobic, and, anaerobic, decomposition, respectively, both, processes, occur, simultaneously, in, different, parts, of, a, landfill, in, addition, to, available, o, 2, the, fraction, of, gas, constituents, will, vary, depending, on, the, age, of, landfill, type, of, waste, moisture, content, and, other, factors, for, example, the, maximum, amount, of, landfill, gas, produced, can, be, illustrated, a, simplified, net, reaction, of, diethyl, oxalate, that, accounts, for, these, simultaneous, reactions, 4, c, 6, h, 10, o, 4, 6, h, 2, o, 13, ch, 4, 11, co, 2, on, average, about, half, of, the, volumetric, concentration, of, landfill, gas, is, ch, 4, and, slightly, less, than, half, is, co, 2, the, gas, also, contains, about, 5, molecular, nitrogen, n, 2, less, than, 1, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, and, a, low, concentration, of, non, methane, organic, compounds, nmoc, about, 2700, ppmv, landfill, gases, can, seep, out, of, the, landfill, and, into, the, surrounding, air, and, soil, methane, is, a, greenhouse, gas, and, is, flammable, and, potentially, explosive, at, certain, concentrations, which, makes, it, perfect, for, burning, to, generate, electricity, cleanly, since, decomposing, plant, matter, and, food, waste, only, release, carbon, that, has, been, captured, from, the, atmosphere, through, photosynthesis, no, new, carbon, enters, the, carbon, cycle, and, the, atmospheric, concentration, of, co, 2, is, not, affected, carbon, dioxide, traps, heat, in, the, atmosphere, contributing, to, climate, change, in, properly, managed, landfills, gas, is, collected, and, flared, or, recovered, for, landfill, gas, utilization, poorly, run, landfills, may, become, nuisances, because, of, vectors, such, as, rats, and, flies, which, can, spread, infectious, diseases, the, occurrence, of, such, vectors, can, be, mitigated, through, the, use, of, daily, cover, other, potential, issues, include, wildlife, disruption, due, to, occupation, of, habitat, and, animal, health, disruption, caused, by, consuming, waste, from, landfills, dust, odor, noise, pollution, and, reduced, local, property, values, gases, are, produced, in, landfills, due, to, the, anaerobic, digestion, by, microbes, in, a, properly, managed, landfill, this, gas, is, collected, and, used, its, uses, range, from, simple, flaring, to, the, landfill, gas, utilization, and, generation, of, electricity, landfill, gas, monitoring, alerts, workers, to, the, presence, of, a, build, up, of, gases, to, a, harmful, level, in, some, countries, landfill, gas, recovery, is, extensive, in, the, united, states, for, example, more, than, 850, landfills, have, active, landfill, gas, recovery, systems, a, solar, landfill, is, a, repurposed, used, landfill, that, is, converted, to, a, solar, array, solar, farm, landfills, in, canada, are, regulated, by, provincial, environmental, agencies, and, environmental, protection, legislation, older, facilities, tend, to, fall, under, current, standards, and, are, monitored, for, leaching, some, former, locations, have, been, converted, to, parkland, in, the, european, union, individual, states, are, obliged, to, enact, legislation, to, comply, with, the, requirements, and, obligations, of, the, european, landfill, directive, the, majority, of, eu, member, states, have, laws, banning, or, severely, restricting, the, disposal, of, household, trash, via, landfills, landfilling, is, currently, the, major, method, of, municipal, waste, disposal, in, india, india, also, has, asia, s, largest, dumping, ground, in, deonar, mumbai, however, issues, frequently, arise, due, to, the, alarming, growth, rate, of, landfills, and, poor, management, by, authorities, on, and, under, surface, fires, have, been, commonly, seen, in, the, indian, landfills, over, the, last, few, years, landfilling, practices, in, the, uk, have, had, to, change, in, recent, years, to, meet, the, challenges, of, the, european, landfill, directive, the, uk, now, imposes, landfill, tax, upon, biodegradable, waste, which, is, put, into, landfills, in, addition, to, this, the, landfill, allowance, trading, scheme, has, been, established, for, local, authorities, to, trade, landfill, quotas, in, england, a, different, system, operates, in, wales, where, authorities, cannot, trade, amongst, themselves, but, have, allowances, known, as, the, landfill, allowance, scheme, u, s, landfills, are, regulated, by, each, state, s, environmental, agency, which, establishes, minimum, guidelines, however, none, of, these, standards, may, fall, below, those, set, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, permitting, a, landfill, generally, takes, between, five, and, seven, years, costs, millions, of, dollars, and, requires, rigorous, siting, engineering, and, environmental, studies, and, demonstrations, to, ensure, local, environmental, and, safety, concerns, are, satisfied, the, status, of, a, landfill, s, microbial, community, may, determine, its, digestive, efficiency, bacteria, that, digest, plastic, have, been, found, in, landfills, one, can, treat, landfills, as, a, viable, and, abundant, source, of, materials, and, energy, in, the, developing, world, waste, pickers, often, scavenge, for, still, usable, materials, in, commercial, contexts, companies, have, also, discovered, landfill, sites, and, many, have, begun, harvesting, materials, and, energy, well, known, examples, include, gas, recovery, facilities, other, commercial, facilities, include, waste, incinerators, which, have, built, in, material, recovery, this, material, recovery, is, possible, through, the, use, of, filters, electro, filter, active, carbon, and, potassium, filter, quench, hcl, washer, so, 2, washer, bottom, ash, grating, etc, in, addition, to, waste, reduction, and, recycling, strategies, there, are, various, alternatives, to, landfills, including, waste, to, energy, incineration, anaerobic, digestion, composting, mechanical, biological, treatment, pyrolysis, and, plasma, arc, gasification, depending, on, local, economics, and, incentives, these, can, be, made, more, financially, attractive, than, landfills, countries, including, germany, austria, sweden, denmark, belgium, the, netherlands, and, switzerland, have, banned, the, disposal, of, untreated, waste, in, landfills, in, these, countries, only, certain, hazardous, wastes, fly, ashes, from, incineration, or, the, stabilized, output, of, mechanical, biological, treatment, plants, may, still, be, deposited
