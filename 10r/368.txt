https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet
a, rivet, is, a, permanent, mechanical, fastener, before, being, installed, a, rivet, consists, of, a, smooth, cylindrical, shaft, with, a, head, on, one, end, the, end, opposite, the, head, is, called, the, tail, on, installation, the, deformed, end, is, called, the, shop, head, or, buck, tail, because, there, is, effectively, a, head, on, each, end, of, an, installed, rivet, it, can, support, tension, loads, however, it, is, much, more, capable, of, supporting, shear, loads, loads, perpendicular, to, the, axis, of, the, shaft, fastenings, used, in, traditional, wooden, boat, building, such, as, copper, nails, and, clinch, bolts, work, on, the, same, principle, as, the, rivet, but, were, in, use, long, before, the, term, rivet, was, introduced, and, where, they, are, remembered, are, usually, classified, among, nails, and, bolts, respectively, rivet, holes, have, been, found, in, egyptian, spearheads, dating, back, to, the, naqada, culture, of, between, 4400, and, 3000, b, c, archeologists, have, also, uncovered, many, bronze, age, swords, and, daggers, with, rivet, holes, where, the, handles, would, have, been, the, rivets, themselves, were, essentially, short, rods, of, metal, which, metalworkers, hammered, into, a, pre, drilled, hole, on, one, side, and, deformed, on, the, other, to, hold, them, in, place, there, are, several, types, of, rivets, designed, to, meet, different, cost, accessibility, and, strength, requirements, solid, rivets, are, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, reliable, types, of, fasteners, having, been, found, in, archaeological, findings, dating, back, to, the, bronze, age, solid, rivets, consist, simply, of, a, shaft, and, head, that, are, deformed, with, a, hammer, or, rivet, gun, a, rivet, compression, or, crimping, tool, can, also, deform, this, type, of, rivet, this, tool, is, mainly, used, on, rivets, close, to, the, edge, of, the, fastened, material, since, the, tool, is, limited, by, the, depth, of, its, frame, a, rivet, compression, tool, does, not, require, two, people, and, is, generally, the, most, foolproof, way, to, install, solid, rivets, solid, rivets, are, used, in, applications, where, reliability, and, safety, count, a, typical, application, for, solid, rivets, can, be, found, within, the, structural, parts, of, aircraft, hundreds, of, thousands, of, solid, rivets, are, used, to, assemble, the, frame, of, a, modern, aircraft, such, rivets, come, with, rounded, universal, or, 100, countersunk, heads, typical, materials, for, aircraft, rivets, are, aluminium, alloys, 2017, 2024, 2117, 7050, 5056, 55000, v, 65, titanium, and, nickel, based, alloys, e, g, monel, some, aluminium, alloy, rivets, are, too, hard, to, buck, and, must, be, softened, by, solution, treating, precipitation, hardening, prior, to, being, bucked, ice, box, aluminium, alloy, rivets, harden, with, age, and, must, likewise, be, annealed, and, then, kept, at, sub, freezing, temperatures, hence, the, name, ice, box, to, slow, the, age, hardening, process, steel, rivets, can, be, found, in, static, structures, such, as, bridges, cranes, and, building, frames, the, setting, of, these, fasteners, requires, access, to, both, sides, of, a, structure, solid, rivets, are, driven, using, a, hydraulically, pneumatically, or, electromagnetically, actuated, squeezing, tool, or, even, a, handheld, hammer, applications, where, only, one, side, is, accessible, require, blind, rivets, solid, rivets, are, also, used, by, some, artisans, in, the, construction, of, modern, reproduction, of, medieval, armour, jewellery, and, metal, couture, until, relatively, recently, structural, steel, connections, were, either, welded, or, riveted, high, strength, bolts, have, largely, replaced, structural, steel, rivets, indeed, the, latest, steel, construction, specifications, published, by, aisc, the, 14th, edition, no, longer, cover, their, installation, the, reason, for, the, change, is, primarily, due, to, the, expense, of, skilled, workers, required, to, install, high, strength, structural, steel, rivets, whereas, two, relatively, unskilled, workers, can, install, and, tighten, high, strength, bolts, it, normally, takes, four, skilled, workers, to, install, rivets, warmer, catcher, holder, basher, at, a, central, location, near, the, areas, being, riveted, a, furnace, was, set, up, rivets, were, placed, in, the, furnace, and, heated, to, approximately, 900, c, or, cherry, red, the, rivet, warmer, or, cook, used, tongs, to, remove, individual, rivets, and, throw, them, to, a, catcher, stationed, near, the, joints, to, be, riveted, the, catcher, usually, caught, the, rivet, in, a, leather, or, wooden, bucket, with, an, ash, lined, bottom, the, catcher, inserted, the, rivet, into, the, hole, to, be, riveted, then, quickly, turned, to, catch, the, next, rivet, the, holder, up, or, holder, on, would, hold, a, heavy, bucking, bar, or, dolly, or, another, larger, pneumatic, jack, against, the, round, shop, head, of, the, rivet, while, the, riveter, sometimes, two, riveters, applied, a, hammer, or, pneumatic, rivet, hammer, with, a, rivet, set, to, the, tail, of, the, rivet, making, it, mushroom, against, the, joint, forming, the, field, head, into, its, final, domed, shape, alternatively, the, buck, is, hammered, more, or, less, flush, with, the, structure, in, a, counter, sunk, hole, on, cooling, the, rivet, contracted, axially, exerting, the, clamping, force, on, the, joint, before, the, use, of, pneumatic, hammers, e, g, in, the, construction, of, rms, titanic, the, person, who, hammered, the, rivet, was, known, as, the, basher, the, last, commonly, used, high, strength, structural, steel, rivets, were, designated, astm, a502, grade, 1, rivets, such, riveted, structures, may, be, insufficient, to, resist, seismic, loading, from, earthquakes, if, the, structure, was, not, engineered, for, such, forces, a, common, problem, of, older, steel, bridges, this, is, because, a, hot, rivet, cannot, be, properly, heat, treated, to, add, strength, and, hardness, in, the, seismic, retrofit, of, such, structures, it, is, common, practice, to, remove, critical, rivets, with, an, oxygen, torch, precision, ream, the, hole, then, insert, a, machined, and, heat, treated, bolt, semi, tubular, rivets, also, known, as, tubular, rivets, are, similar, to, solid, rivets, except, they, have, a, partial, hole, opposite, the, head, at, the, tip, the, purpose, of, this, hole, is, to, reduce, the, amount, of, force, needed, for, application, by, rolling, the, tubular, portion, outward, the, force, needed, to, apply, a, semi, tubular, rivet, is, about, 1, 4, of, the, amount, needed, to, apply, a, solid, rivet, tubular, rivets, are, sometimes, preferred, for, pivot, points, a, joint, where, movement, is, desired, since, the, swelling, of, the, rivet, is, only, at, the, tail, the, type, of, equipment, used, to, apply, semi, tubular, rivets, ranges, from, prototyping, tools, to, fully, automated, systems, typical, installation, tools, from, lowest, to, highest, price, are, hand, set, manual, squeezer, pneumatic, squeezer, kick, press, impact, riveter, and, finally, plc, controlled, robotics, the, most, common, machine, is, the, impact, riveter, and, the, most, common, use, of, semi, tubular, rivets, is, in, lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, hvac, duct, work, mechanical, products, and, electronics, they, are, offered, from, 1, 16, inch, 1, 6, mm, to, 3, 8, inch, 9, 5, mm, in, diameter, other, sizes, are, considered, highly, special, and, can, be, up, to, 8, inches, 203, mm, long, a, wide, variety, of, materials, and, platings, are, available, most, common, base, metals, are, steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum, and, the, most, common, platings, are, zinc, nickel, brass, tin, tubular, rivets, are, normally, waxed, to, facilitate, proper, assembly, an, installed, tubular, rivet, has, a, head, on, one, side, with, a, rolled, over, and, exposed, shallow, blind, hole, on, the, other, blind, rivets, commonly, referred, to, as, pop, rivets, pop, is, the, brand, name, of, the, original, manufacturer, now, owned, by, stanley, engineered, fastening, a, division, of, stanley, black, decker, are, tubular, and, are, supplied, with, a, nail, like, mandrel, through, the, center, which, has, a, necked, or, weakened, area, near, the, head, the, rivet, assembly, is, inserted, into, a, hole, drilled, through, the, parts, to, be, joined, and, a, specially, designed, tool, is, used, to, draw, the, mandrel, through, the, rivet, the, compression, force, between, the, head, of, the, mandrel, and, the, tool, expands, the, diameter, of, the, tube, throughout, its, length, locking, the, sheets, being, fastened, if, the, hole, was, the, correct, size, the, head, of, the, mandrel, also, expands, the, blind, end, of, the, rivet, to, a, diameter, greater, than, that, of, the, drilled, hole, compressing, the, fastened, sheets, between, the, head, of, the, rivet, and, the, head, of, the, mandrel, at, a, predetermined, tension, the, mandrel, breaks, at, the, necked, location, with, open, tubular, rivets, the, head, of, the, mandrel, may, or, may, not, remain, embedded, in, the, expanded, portion, of, the, rivet, and, can, come, loose, at, a, later, time, more, expensive, closed, end, tubular, rivets, are, formed, around, the, mandrel, so, the, head, of, the, mandrel, is, always, retained, inside, the, blind, end, after, installation, pop, rivets, can, be, fully, installed, with, access, to, only, one, side, of, a, part, or, structure, prior, to, the, invention, of, blind, rivets, installation, of, a, rivet, typically, required, access, to, both, sides, of, the, assembly, a, rivet, hammer, on, one, side, and, a, bucking, bar, on, the, other, side, in, 1916, royal, navy, reservist, and, engineer, hamilton, neil, wylie, filed, a, patent, for, an, improved, means, of, closing, tubular, rivets, granted, may, 1917, in, 1922, wylie, joined, the, british, aircraft, manufacturer, armstrong, whitworth, ltd, to, advise, on, metal, construction, techniques, here, he, continued, to, develop, his, rivet, design, with, a, further, 1927, patent, that, incorporated, the, pull, through, mandrel, and, allowed, the, rivet, to, be, used, blind, by, 1928, the, george, tucker, eyelet, company, of, birmingham, england, produced, a, cup, rivet, based, on, the, design, it, required, a, separate, gkn, mandrel, and, the, rivet, body, to, be, hand, assembled, prior, to, use, for, the, building, of, the, siskin, iii, aircraft, together, with, armstrong, whitworth, the, geo, tucker, co, further, modified, the, rivet, design, to, produce, a, one, piece, unit, incorporating, a, mandrel, and, rivet, this, product, was, later, developed, in, aluminium, and, trademarked, as, the, pop, rivet, the, united, shoe, machinery, co, produced, the, design, in, the, u, s, as, inventors, such, as, carl, cherry, and, lou, huck, experimented, with, other, techniques, for, expanding, solid, rivets, they, are, available, in, flat, head, countersunk, head, and, modified, flush, head, with, standard, diameters, of, 1, 8, 5, 32, and, 3, 16, inch, blind, rivets, are, made, from, soft, aluminum, alloy, steel, including, stainless, steel, copper, and, monel, there, are, also, structural, blind, rivets, which, are, designed, to, take, shear, and, tensile, loads, the, rivet, body, is, normally, manufactured, using, one, of, three, methods, there, is, a, vast, array, of, specialty, blind, rivets, that, are, suited, for, high, strength, or, plastic, applications, typical, types, include, internally, and, externally, locked, structural, blind, rivets, can, be, used, in, aircraft, applications, because, unlike, other, types, of, blind, rivets, the, locked, mandrels, cannot, fall, out, and, are, watertight, since, the, mandrel, is, locked, into, place, they, have, the, same, or, greater, shear, load, carrying, capacity, as, solid, rivets, and, may, be, used, to, replace, solid, rivets, on, all, but, the, most, critical, stressed, aircraft, structures, the, typical, assembly, process, requires, the, operator, to, install, the, rivet, in, the, nose, of, the, tool, by, hand, and, then, actuate, the, tool, however, in, recent, years, automated, riveting, systems, have, become, popular, in, an, effort, to, reduce, assembly, costs, and, repetitive, disorders, the, cost, of, such, tools, ranges, from, us, 1, 500, for, auto, feed, pneumatics, to, us, 50, 000, for, fully, robotic, systems, while, structural, blind, rivets, using, a, locked, mandrel, are, common, there, are, also, aircraft, applications, using, non, structural, blind, rivets, where, the, reduced, but, still, predictable, strength, of, the, rivet, without, the, mandrel, is, used, as, the, design, strength, a, method, popularized, by, chris, heintz, of, zenith, aircraft, uses, a, common, flat, head, countersunk, rivet, which, is, drawn, into, a, specially, machined, nosepiece, that, forms, it, into, a, round, head, rivet, taking, up, much, of, the, variation, inherent, in, hole, size, found, in, amateur, aircraft, construction, aircraft, designed, with, these, rivets, use, rivet, strength, figures, measured, with, the, mandrel, removed, oscar, rivets, are, similar, to, blind, rivets, in, appearance, and, installation, but, have, splits, typically, three, along, the, hollow, shaft, these, splits, cause, the, shaft, to, fold, and, flare, out, similar, to, the, wings, on, a, toggle, bolt, s, nut, as, the, mandrel, is, drawn, into, the, rivet, this, flare, or, flange, provides, a, wide, bearing, surface, that, reduces, the, chance, of, rivet, pull, out, this, design, is, ideal, for, high, vibration, applications, where, the, back, surface, is, inaccessible, a, version, of, the, oscar, rivet, is, the, olympic, rivet, which, uses, an, aluminum, mandrel, that, is, drawn, into, the, rivet, head, after, installation, the, head, and, mandrel, are, shaved, off, flush, resulting, in, an, appearance, closely, resembling, a, brazier, head, driven, rivet, they, are, used, in, the, repair, of, airstream, trailers, to, replicate, the, look, of, the, original, rivets, a, drive, rivet, is, a, form, of, blind, rivet, that, has, a, short, mandrel, protruding, from, the, head, that, is, driven, in, with, a, hammer, to, flare, out, the, end, inserted, in, the, hole, this, is, commonly, used, to, rivet, wood, panels, into, place, since, the, hole, does, not, need, to, be, drilled, all, the, way, through, the, panel, producing, an, aesthetically, pleasing, appearance, they, can, also, be, used, with, plastic, metal, and, other, materials, and, require, no, special, setting, tool, other, than, a, hammer, and, possibly, a, backing, block, steel, or, some, other, dense, material, placed, behind, the, location, of, the, rivet, while, hammering, it, into, place, drive, rivets, have, less, clamping, force, than, most, other, rivets, drive, screws, possibly, another, name, for, drive, rivets, are, commonly, used, to, hold, nameplates, into, blind, holes, they, typically, have, spiral, threads, that, grip, the, side, of, the, hole, a, flush, rivet, is, used, primarily, on, external, metal, surfaces, where, good, appearance, and, the, elimination, of, unnecessary, aerodynamic, drag, are, important, a, flush, rivet, takes, advantage, of, a, countersunk, or, dimpled, hole, they, are, also, commonly, referred, to, as, countersunk, rivets, countersunk, or, flush, rivets, are, used, extensively, on, the, exterior, of, aircraft, for, aerodynamic, reasons, such, as, reduced, drag, and, turbulence, additional, post, installation, machining, may, be, performed, to, perfect, the, airflow, flush, riveting, was, invented, in, america, in, the, 1930s, by, vladimir, pavlecka, and, his, team, at, douglas, aircraft, the, technology, was, used, by, howard, hughes, in, the, design, and, production, of, his, h, 1, plane, the, hughes, h, 1, racer, these, resemble, an, expanding, bolt, except, the, shaft, snaps, below, the, surface, when, the, tension, is, sufficient, the, blind, end, may, be, either, countersunk, flush, or, dome, shaped, one, early, form, of, blind, rivet, that, was, the, first, to, be, widely, used, for, aircraft, construction, and, repair, was, the, cherry, friction, lock, rivet, originally, cherry, friction, locks, were, available, in, two, styles, hollow, shank, pull, through, and, self, plugging, types, the, pull, through, type, is, no, longer, common, however, the, self, plugging, cherry, friction, lock, rivet, is, still, used, for, repairing, light, aircraft, cherry, friction, lock, rivets, are, available, in, two, head, styles, universal, and, 100, degree, countersunk, furthermore, they, are, usually, supplied, in, three, standard, diameters, 1, 8, 5, 32, and, 3, 16, inch, a, friction, lock, rivet, cannot, replace, a, solid, shank, rivet, size, for, size, when, a, friction, lock, is, used, to, replace, a, solid, shank, rivet, it, must, be, at, least, one, size, larger, in, diameter, because, the, friction, lock, rivet, loses, considerable, strength, if, its, center, stem, falls, out, due, to, vibrations, or, damage, self, pierce, riveting, spr, is, a, process, of, joining, two, or, more, materials, using, an, engineered, rivet, unlike, solid, blind, and, semi, tubular, rivets, self, pierce, rivets, do, not, require, a, drilled, or, punched, hole, sprs, are, cold, forged, to, a, semi, tubular, shape, and, contain, a, partial, hole, to, the, opposite, end, of, the, head, the, end, geometry, of, the, rivet, has, a, chamfered, poke, that, helps, the, rivet, pierce, the, materials, being, joined, a, hydraulic, or, electric, servo, rivet, setter, drives, the, rivet, into, the, material, and, an, upsetting, die, provides, a, cavity, for, the, displaced, bottom, sheet, material, to, flow, the, spr, process, is, described, in, here, spr, process, the, self, pierce, rivet, fully, pierces, the, top, sheet, material, s, but, only, partially, pierces, the, bottom, sheet, as, the, tail, end, of, the, rivet, does, not, break, through, the, bottom, sheet, it, provides, a, water, or, gas, tight, joint, with, the, influence, of, the, upsetting, die, the, tail, end, of, the, rivet, flares, and, interlocks, into, the, bottom, sheet, forming, a, low, profile, button, rivets, need, to, be, harder, than, the, materials, being, joined, they, are, heat, treated, to, various, levels, of, hardness, depending, on, the, material, s, ductility, and, hardness, rivets, come, in, a, range, of, diameters, and, lengths, depending, on, the, materials, being, joined, head, styles, are, either, flush, countersunk, or, pan, heads, depending, on, the, rivet, setter, configuration, i, e, hydraulic, servo, stroke, nose, to, die, gap, feed, system, etc, cycle, times, can, be, as, quick, as, one, second, rivets, are, typically, fed, to, the, rivet, setter, nose, from, tape, and, come, in, cassette, or, spool, form, for, continuous, production, riveting, systems, can, be, manual, or, automated, depending, on, the, application, requirements, all, systems, are, very, flexible, in, terms, of, product, design, and, ease, of, integration, into, a, manufacturing, process, spr, joins, a, range, of, dissimilar, materials, such, as, steel, aluminum, plastics, composites, and, pre, coated, or, pre, painted, materials, benefits, include, low, energy, demands, no, heat, fumes, sparks, or, waste, and, very, repeatable, quality, compression, rivets, are, commonly, used, for, functional, or, decorative, purposes, on, clothing, accessories, and, other, items, they, have, male, and, female, halves, that, press, together, through, a, hole, in, the, material, double, cap, rivets, have, aesthetic, caps, on, both, sides, single, cap, rivets, have, caps, on, just, one, side, the, other, side, is, low, profile, with, a, visible, hole, cutlery, rivets, are, commonly, used, to, attach, handles, to, knife, blades, and, other, utensils, rivets, come, in, both, inch, series, and, metric, series, the, main, official, standards, relate, more, to, technical, parameters, such, as, ultimate, tensile, strength, and, surface, finishing, than, physical, length, and, diameter, they, are, rivet, diameters, are, commonly, measured, in, 1, 32, inch, increments, and, their, lengths, in, 1, 16, inch, increments, expressed, as, dash, numbers, at, the, end, of, the, rivet, identification, number, a, dash, 3, dash, 4, xxxxxx, 3, 4, designation, indicates, a, 3, 32, inch, diameter, and, 4, 16, inch, or, 1, 4, inch, length, some, rivets, lengths, are, also, available, in, half, sizes, and, have, a, dash, number, such, as, 3, 5, 7, 32, inch, to, indicate, they, are, half, size, the, letters, and, digits, in, a, rivet, s, identification, number, that, precede, its, dash, numbers, indicate, the, specification, under, which, the, rivet, was, manufactured, and, the, head, style, on, many, rivets, a, size, in, 32nds, may, be, stamped, on, the, rivet, head, other, makings, on, the, rivet, head, such, as, small, raised, or, depressed, dimples, or, small, raised, bars, indicate, the, rivet, s, alloy, to, become, a, proper, fastener, a, rivet, should, be, placed, in, a, hole, ideally, 4, 6, thousandths, of, an, inch, larger, in, diameter, this, allows, the, rivet, to, be, easily, and, fully, inserted, then, setting, allows, the, rivet, to, expand, tightly, filling, the, gap, and, maximizing, strength, rivet, diameters, and, lengths, are, measured, in, millimeters, conveniently, the, rivet, diameter, relates, to, the, drill, required, to, make, a, hole, to, accept, the, rivet, rather, than, the, actual, diameter, of, the, rivet, which, is, slightly, smaller, this, facilitates, the, use, of, a, simple, drill, gauge, to, check, both, rivet, and, drill, are, compatible, for, general, use, diameters, between, 2, mm, 20, mm, and, lengths, from, 5, mm, 50, mm, are, common, the, design, type, material, and, any, finish, is, usually, expressed, in, plain, language, often, english, before, welding, techniques, and, bolted, joints, were, developed, metal, framed, buildings, and, structures, such, as, the, eiffel, tower, shukhov, tower, and, the, sydney, harbour, bridge, were, generally, held, together, by, riveting, as, were, automobile, chassis, riveting, is, still, widely, used, in, applications, where, light, weight, and, high, strength, are, critical, such, as, in, an, aircraft, sheet, metal, alloys, used, in, aircraft, skins, are, generally, not, welded, because, the, aircraft, in, high, speed, flight, skins, will, be, stretched, extrusion, may, occur, deformation, and, change, in, material, properties, riveting, can, reduce, the, vibration, transmission, between, joints, thereby, reducing, the, risk, of, cracking, the, firmness, is, better, and, more, reliable, against, such, repeated, stress, changes, in, order, to, reduce, air, resistance, countersunk, rivets, are, generally, used, in, aircraft, skins, a, large, number, of, countries, used, rivets, in, the, construction, of, armored, tanks, during, world, war, ii, including, the, m3, lee, general, grant, manufactured, in, the, united, states, however, many, countries, soon, learned, that, rivets, were, a, large, weakness, in, tank, design, since, if, a, tank, was, hit, by, a, large, projectile, it, would, dislocate, the, rivets, and, they, would, fly, around, the, inside, of, the, tank, and, injure, or, kill, the, crew, even, if, the, projectile, did, not, penetrate, the, armor, some, countries, such, as, italy, japan, and, britain, used, rivets, in, some, or, all, of, their, tank, designs, throughout, the, war, for, various, reasons, such, as, lack, of, welding, equipment, or, inability, to, weld, very, thick, plates, of, armor, effectively, blind, rivets, are, used, almost, universally, in, the, construction, of, plywood, road, cases, common, but, more, exotic, uses, of, rivets, are, to, reinforce, jeans, and, to, produce, the, distinctive, sound, of, a, sizzle, cymbal, the, stress, and, shear, in, a, rivet, are, analyzed, like, a, bolted, joint, however, it, is, not, wise, to, combine, rivets, with, bolts, and, screws, in, the, same, joint, rivets, fill, the, hole, where, they, are, installed, to, establish, a, very, tight, fit, often, called, an, interference, fit, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, obtain, such, a, tight, fit, with, other, fasteners, the, result, is, that, rivets, in, the, same, joint, with, loose, fasteners, carry, more, of, the, load, they, are, effectively, stiffer, the, rivet, can, then, fail, before, it, can, redistribute, load, to, the, other, loose, fit, fasteners, like, bolts, and, screws, this, often, causes, catastrophic, failure, of, the, joint, when, the, fasteners, unzip, in, general, a, joint, composed, of, similar, fasteners, is, the, most, efficient, because, all, fasteners, reach, capacity, simultaneously, there, are, several, methods, for, installing, solid, rivets, rivets, small, enough, and, soft, enough, are, often, bucked, in, this, process, the, installer, places, a, rivet, gun, against, the, factory, head, and, holds, a, bucking, bar, against, the, tail, or, a, hard, working, surface, the, bucking, bar, is, a, specially, shaped, solid, block, of, metal, the, rivet, gun, provides, a, series, of, high, impulse, forces, that, upsets, and, work, hardens, the, tail, of, the, rivet, between, the, work, and, the, inertia, of, the, bucking, bar, rivets, that, are, large, or, hard, may, be, more, easily, installed, by, squeezing, instead, in, this, process, a, tool, in, contact, with, each, end, of, the, rivet, clinches, to, deform, the, rivet, rivets, may, also, be, upset, by, hand, using, a, ball, peen, hammer, the, head, is, placed, in, a, special, hole, made, to, accommodate, it, known, as, a, rivet, set, the, hammer, is, applied, to, the, buck, tail, of, the, rivet, rolling, an, edge, so, that, it, is, flush, against, the, material, a, hammer, is, also, used, to, ring, an, installed, rivet, as, a, non, destructive, test, for, tightness, and, imperfections, the, inspector, taps, the, head, usually, the, factory, head, of, the, rivet, with, the, hammer, while, touching, the, rivet, and, base, plate, lightly, with, the, other, hand, and, judges, the, quality, of, the, audibly, returned, sound, and, the, feel, of, the, sound, traveling, through, the, metal, to, the, operator, s, fingers, a, rivet, tightly, set, in, its, hole, returns, a, clean, and, clear, ring, while, a, loose, rivet, produces, a, recognizably, different, sound, a, blind, rivet, has, strength, properties, that, can, be, measured, in, terms, of, shear, and, tensile, strength, occasionally, rivets, also, undergo, performance, testing, for, other, critical, features, such, as, pushout, force, break, load, and, salt, spray, resistance, a, standardized, destructive, test, according, to, the, inch, fastener, standards, is, widely, accepted, the, shear, test, involves, installing, a, rivet, into, two, plates, at, specified, hardness, and, thickness, and, measuring, the, force, necessary, to, shear, the, plates, the, tensile, test, is, basically, the, same, except, that, it, measures, the, pullout, strength, per, the, ifi, 135, standard, all, blind, rivets, produced, must, meet, this, standard, these, tests, determine, the, strength, of, the, rivet, and, not, the, strength, of, the, assembly, to, determine, the, strength, of, the, assembly, a, user, must, consult, an, engineering, guide, or, the, machinery, s, handbook
