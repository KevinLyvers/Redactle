military, engineering, is, loosely, defined, as, the, art, science, and, practice, of, designing, and, building, military, works, and, maintaining, lines, of, military, transport, and, military, communications, military, engineers, are, also, responsible, for, logistics, behind, military, tactics, modern, military, engineering, differs, from, civil, engineering, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, military, engineering, also, includes, cbrn, defense, and, other, engineering, disciplines, such, as, mechanical, and, electrical, engineering, techniques, according, to, nato, military, engineering, is, that, engineer, activity, undertaken, regardless, of, component, or, service, to, shape, the, physical, operating, environment, military, engineering, incorporates, support, to, maneuver, and, to, the, force, as, a, whole, including, military, engineering, functions, such, as, engineer, support, to, force, protection, counter, improvised, explosive, devices, environmental, protection, engineer, intelligence, and, military, search, military, engineering, does, not, encompass, the, activities, undertaken, by, those, engineers, who, maintain, repair, and, operate, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, weapon, systems, and, equipment, military, engineering, is, an, academic, subject, taught, in, military, academies, or, schools, of, military, engineering, the, construction, and, demolition, tasks, related, to, military, engineering, are, usually, performed, by, military, engineers, including, soldiers, trained, as, sappers, or, pioneers, in, modern, armies, soldiers, trained, to, perform, such, tasks, while, well, forward, in, battle, and, under, fire, are, often, called, combat, engineers, in, some, countries, military, engineers, may, also, perform, non, military, construction, tasks, in, peacetime, such, as, flood, control, and, river, navigation, works, but, such, activities, do, not, fall, within, the, scope, of, military, engineering, the, word, engineer, was, initially, used, in, the, context, of, warfare, dating, back, to, 1325, when, engine, er, literally, one, who, operates, an, engine, referred, to, a, constructor, of, military, engines, in, this, context, engine, referred, to, a, military, machine, i, e, a, mechanical, contraption, used, in, war, for, example, a, catapult, as, the, design, of, civilian, structures, such, as, bridges, and, buildings, developed, as, a, technical, discipline, the, term, civil, engineering, entered, the, lexicon, as, a, way, to, distinguish, between, those, specializing, in, the, construction, of, such, non, military, projects, and, those, involved, in, the, older, discipline, as, the, prevalence, of, civil, engineering, outstripped, engineering, in, a, military, context, and, the, number, of, disciplines, expanded, the, original, military, meaning, of, the, word, engineering, is, now, largely, obsolete, in, its, place, the, term, military, engineering, has, come, to, be, used, in, ancient, times, military, engineers, were, responsible, for, siege, warfare, and, building, field, fortifications, temporary, camps, and, roads, the, most, notable, engineers, of, ancient, times, were, the, romans, and, chinese, who, constructed, huge, siege, machines, catapults, battering, rams, and, siege, towers, the, romans, were, responsible, for, constructing, fortified, wooden, camps, and, paved, roads, for, their, legions, many, of, these, roman, roads, are, still, in, use, today, the, first, civilization, to, have, a, dedicated, force, of, military, engineering, specialists, were, the, romans, whose, army, contained, a, dedicated, corps, of, military, engineers, known, as, architecti, this, group, was, pre, eminent, among, its, contemporaries, the, scale, of, certain, military, engineering, feats, such, as, the, construction, of, a, double, wall, of, fortifications, 30, miles, 48, km, long, in, just, 6, weeks, to, completely, encircle, the, besieged, city, of, alesia, in, 52, b, c, e, is, an, example, such, military, engineering, feats, would, have, been, completely, new, and, probably, bewildering, and, demoralizing, to, the, gallic, defenders, vitruvius, is, the, best, known, of, these, roman, army, engineers, due, to, his, writings, surviving, examples, of, battles, before, the, early, modern, period, where, military, engineers, played, a, decisive, role, include, the, siege, of, tyre, under, alexander, the, great, the, siege, of, masada, by, lucius, flavius, silva, as, well, as, the, battle, of, the, trench, under, the, suggestion, of, salman, the, persian, to, dig, a, trench, for, about, 600, years, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, practice, of, military, engineering, barely, evolved, in, the, west, in, fact, much, of, the, classic, techniques, and, practices, of, roman, military, engineering, were, lost, through, this, period, the, foot, soldier, who, was, pivotal, to, much, of, the, roman, military, engineering, capability, was, largely, replaced, by, mounted, soldiers, it, was, not, until, later, in, the, middle, ages, that, military, engineering, saw, a, revival, focused, on, siege, warfare, military, engineers, planned, castles, and, fortresses, when, laying, siege, they, planned, and, oversaw, efforts, to, penetrate, castle, defenses, when, castles, served, a, military, purpose, one, of, the, tasks, of, the, sappers, was, to, weaken, the, bases, of, walls, to, enable, them, to, be, breached, before, means, of, thwarting, these, activities, were, devised, broadly, speaking, sappers, were, experts, at, demolishing, or, otherwise, overcoming, or, bypassing, fortification, systems, with, the, 14th, century, development, of, gunpowder, new, siege, engines, in, the, form, of, cannons, appeared, initially, military, engineers, were, responsible, for, maintaining, and, operating, these, new, weapons, just, as, had, been, the, case, with, previous, siege, engines, in, england, the, challenge, of, managing, the, new, technology, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, office, of, ordnance, around, 1370, in, order, to, administer, the, cannons, armaments, and, castles, of, the, kingdom, both, military, engineers, and, artillery, formed, the, body, of, this, organization, and, served, together, until, the, office, s, successor, the, board, of, ordnance, was, disbanded, in, 1855, in, comparison, to, older, weapons, the, cannon, was, significantly, more, effective, against, traditional, medieval, fortifications, military, engineering, significantly, revised, the, way, fortifications, were, built, in, order, to, be, better, protected, from, enemy, direct, and, plunging, shot, the, new, fortifications, were, also, intended, to, increase, the, ability, of, defenders, to, bring, fire, onto, attacking, enemies, fort, construction, proliferated, in, 16th, century, europe, based, on, the, trace, italienne, design, by, the, 18th, century, regiments, of, foot, infantry, in, the, british, french, prussian, and, other, armies, included, pioneer, detachments, in, peacetime, these, specialists, constituted, the, regimental, tradesmen, constructing, and, repairing, buildings, transport, wagons, etc, on, active, service, they, moved, at, the, head, of, marching, columns, with, axes, shovels, and, pickaxes, clearing, obstacles, or, building, bridges, to, enable, the, main, body, of, the, regiment, to, move, through, difficult, terrain, the, modern, royal, welch, fusiliers, and, french, foreign, legion, still, maintain, pioneer, sections, who, march, at, the, front, of, ceremonial, parades, carrying, chromium, plated, tools, intended, for, show, only, other, historic, distinctions, include, long, work, aprons, and, the, right, to, wear, beards, in, west, africa, the, ashanti, army, was, accompanied, to, war, by, carpenters, who, were, responsible, for, constructing, shelters, and, blacksmiths, who, repaired, weapons, by, the, 18th, century, sappers, were, deployed, in, the, dahomeyan, army, during, assaults, against, fortifications, the, peninsular, war, 1808, 14, revealed, deficiencies, in, the, training, and, knowledge, of, officers, and, men, of, the, british, army, in, the, conduct, of, siege, operations, and, bridging, during, this, war, low, ranking, royal, engineers, officers, carried, out, large, scale, operations, they, had, under, their, command, working, parties, of, two, or, three, battalions, of, infantry, two, or, three, thousand, men, who, knew, nothing, in, the, art, of, siegeworks, royal, engineers, officers, had, to, demonstrate, the, simplest, tasks, to, the, soldiers, often, while, under, enemy, fire, several, officers, were, lost, and, could, not, be, replaced, and, a, better, system, of, training, for, siege, operations, was, required, on, 23, april, 1812, an, establishment, was, authorised, by, royal, warrant, to, teach, sapping, mining, and, other, military, fieldworks, to, the, junior, officers, of, the, corps, of, royal, engineers, and, the, corps, of, royal, military, artificers, sappers, and, miners, the, first, courses, at, the, royal, engineers, establishment, were, done, on, an, all, ranks, basis, with, the, greatest, regard, to, economy, to, reduce, staff, the, ncos, and, officers, were, responsible, for, instructing, and, examining, the, soldiers, if, the, men, could, not, read, or, write, they, were, taught, to, do, so, and, those, who, could, read, and, write, were, taught, to, draw, and, interpret, simple, plans, the, royal, engineers, establishment, quickly, became, the, centre, of, excellence, for, all, fieldworks, and, bridging, captain, charles, pasley, the, director, of, the, establishment, was, keen, to, confirm, his, teaching, and, regular, exercises, were, held, as, demonstrations, or, as, experiments, to, improve, the, techniques, and, teaching, of, the, establishment, from, 1833, bridging, skills, were, demonstrated, annually, by, the, building, of, a, pontoon, bridge, across, the, medway, which, was, tested, by, the, infantry, of, the, garrison, and, the, cavalry, from, maidstone, these, demonstrations, had, become, a, popular, spectacle, for, the, local, people, by, 1843, when, 43, 000, came, to, watch, a, field, day, laid, on, to, test, a, method, of, assaulting, earthworks, for, a, report, to, the, inspector, general, of, fortifications, in, 1869, the, title, of, the, royal, engineers, establishment, was, changed, to, the, school, of, military, engineering, sme, as, evidence, of, its, status, not, only, as, the, font, of, engineer, doctrine, and, training, for, the, british, army, but, also, as, the, leading, scientific, military, school, in, europe, the, dawn, of, the, internal, combustion, engine, marked, the, beginning, of, a, significant, change, in, military, engineering, with, the, arrival, of, the, automobile, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, heavier, than, air, flight, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, military, engineers, assumed, a, major, new, role, in, supporting, the, movement, and, deployment, of, these, systems, in, war, military, engineers, gained, vast, knowledge, and, experience, in, explosives, they, were, tasked, with, planting, bombs, landmines, and, dynamite, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, standoff, on, the, western, front, caused, the, imperial, german, army, to, gather, experienced, and, particularly, skilled, soldiers, to, form, assault, teams, which, would, break, through, the, allied, trenches, with, enhanced, training, and, special, weapons, such, as, flamethrowers, these, squads, achieved, some, success, but, too, late, to, change, the, outcome, of, the, war, in, early, wwii, however, the, wehrmacht, pioniere, battalions, proved, their, efficiency, in, both, attack, and, defense, somewhat, inspiring, other, armies, to, develop, their, own, combat, engineers, battalions, notably, the, attack, on, fort, eben, emael, in, belgium, was, conducted, by, luftwaffe, glider, deployed, combat, engineers, the, need, to, defeat, the, german, defensive, positions, of, the, atlantic, wall, as, part, of, the, amphibious, landings, in, normandy, in, 1944, led, to, the, development, of, specialist, combat, engineer, vehicles, these, collectively, known, as, hobart, s, funnies, included, a, specific, vehicle, to, carry, combat, engineers, the, churchill, avre, these, and, other, dedicated, assault, vehicles, were, organised, into, the, specialised, 79th, armoured, division, and, deployed, during, operation, overlord, d, day, other, significant, military, engineering, projects, of, world, war, ii, include, mulberry, harbour, and, operation, pluto, modern, military, engineering, still, retains, the, roman, role, of, building, field, fortifications, road, paving, and, breaching, terrain, obstacles, a, notable, military, engineering, task, was, for, example, breaching, the, suez, canal, during, the, yom, kippur, war, military, engineers, can, come, from, a, variety, of, engineering, programs, they, may, be, graduates, of, mechanical, electrical, civil, or, industrial, engineering, modern, military, engineering, can, be, divided, into, three, main, tasks, or, fields, combat, engineering, strategic, support, and, ancillary, support, combat, engineering, is, associated, with, engineering, on, the, battlefield, combat, engineers, are, responsible, for, increasing, mobility, on, the, front, lines, of, war, such, as, digging, trenches, and, building, temporary, facilities, in, war, zones, strategic, support, is, associated, with, providing, service, in, communication, zones, such, as, the, construction, of, airfields, and, the, improvement, and, upgrade, of, ports, roads, and, railways, communication, ancillary, support, includes, provision, and, distribution, of, maps, as, well, as, the, disposal, of, unexploded, warheads, military, engineers, construct, bases, airfields, roads, bridges, ports, and, hospitals, during, peacetime, before, modern, warfare, military, engineers, took, the, role, of, civil, engineers, by, participating, in, the, construction, of, civil, works, projects, nowadays, military, engineers, are, almost, entirely, engaged, in, war, logistics, and, preparedness, explosives, are, defined, as, any, system, that, produces, rapidly, expanding, gases, in, a, given, volume, in, a, short, duration, specific, military, engineering, occupations, also, extend, to, the, field, of, explosives, and, demolitions, and, their, usage, on, the, battlefield, explosive, devices, have, been, used, on, the, battlefield, for, several, centuries, in, numerous, operations, from, combat, to, area, clearance, earliest, known, development, of, explosives, can, be, traced, back, to, 10th, century, china, where, the, chinese, are, credited, with, engineering, the, world, s, first, known, explosive, black, powder, initially, developed, for, recreational, purposes, black, powder, later, was, utilized, for, military, application, in, bombs, and, projectile, propulsion, in, firearms, engineers, in, the, military, who, specialize, in, this, field, formulate, and, design, many, explosive, devices, to, use, in, varying, operating, conditions, such, explosive, compounds, range, from, black, powder, to, modern, plastic, explosives, this, particular, is, commonly, listed, under, the, role, of, combat, engineers, who, demolitions, expertise, also, includes, mine, and, ied, detection, and, disposal, for, more, information, see, bomb, disposal, military, engineers, are, key, in, all, armed, forces, of, the, world, and, invariably, found, either, closely, integrated, into, the, force, structure, or, even, into, the, combat, units, of, the, national, troops, brazilian, army, engineers, can, be, part, of, the, quadro, de, engenheiros, militares, with, its, members, trained, or, professionalized, by, the, traditional, instituto, militar, de, engenharia, ime, military, institute, of, engineering, or, the, arma, de, engenharia, with, its, members, trained, by, the, academia,

engineers, also, take, part, in, exercises, in, saudi, arabia, kuwait, italy, egypt, jordan, canada, poland, and, the, united, states, the, prevalence, of, military, engineering, in, the, united, states, dates, back, to, the, american, revolutionary, war, when, engineers, would, carry, out, tasks, in, the, u, s, army, during, the, war, they, would, map, terrain, to, and, build, fortifications, to, protect, troops, from, opposing, forces, the, first, military, engineering, organization, in, the, united, states, was, the, army, corps, of, engineers, engineers, were, responsible, for, protecting, military, troops, whether, using, fortifications, or, designing, new, technology, and, weaponry, throughout, the, united, states, history, of, warfare, the, army, originally, claimed, engineers, exclusively, but, as, the, u, s, military, branches, expanded, to, the, sea, and, sky, the, need, for, military, engineering, sects, in, all, branches, increased, as, each, branch, of, the, united, states, military, expanded, technology, adapted, to, fit, their, respective, needs
