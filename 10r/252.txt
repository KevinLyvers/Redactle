woodworking, is, the, skill, of, making, items, from, wood, and, includes, cabinetry, furniture, making, wood, carving, joinery, carpentry, and, woodturning, along, with, stone, clay, and, animal, parts, wood, was, one, of, the, first, materials, worked, by, early, humans, microwear, analysis, of, the, mousterian, stone, tools, used, by, the, neanderthals, show, that, many, were, used, to, work, wood, the, development, of, civilization, was, closely, tied, to, the, development, of, increasingly, greater, degrees, of, skill, in, working, these, materials, among, early, finds, of, wooden, tools, are, the, worked, sticks, from, kalambo, falls, clacton, on, sea, and, lehringen, the, spears, from, sch, ningen, germany, provide, some, of, the, first, examples, of, wooden, hunting, implements, flint, tools, were, used, for, carving, since, neolithic, times, carved, wooden, vessels, are, known, for, example, from, the, linear, pottery, culture, wells, at, k, ckhofen, and, eythra, examples, of, bronze, age, wood, carving, include, tree, trunks, worked, into, coffins, from, northern, germany, and, denmark, and, wooden, folding, chairs, the, site, of, fellbach, schmieden, in, germany, has, provided, fine, examples, of, wooden, animal, statues, from, the, iron, age, wooden, idols, from, the, la, t, ne, period, known, from, a, sanctuary, at, the, source, of, the, seine, in, france, there, is, significant, evidence, of, advanced, woodworking, in, ancient, egypt, woodworking, is, depicted, in, many, extant, ancient, egyptian, drawings, and, a, considerable, amount, of, ancient, egyptian, furniture, such, as, stools, chairs, tables, beds, chests, have, been, preserved, tombs, represent, a, large, collection, of, these, artifacts, and, the, inner, coffins, found, in, the, tombs, were, also, made, of, wood, the, metal, used, by, the, egyptians, for, woodworking, tools, was, originally, copper, and, eventually, after, 2000, bc, bronze, as, iron, working, was, unknown, until, much, later, commonly, used, woodworking, tools, included, axes, adzes, chisels, pull, saws, and, bow, drills, mortise, and, tenon, joints, are, attested, from, the, earliest, predynastic, period, these, joints, were, strengthened, using, pegs, dowels, and, leather, or, cord, lashings, animal, glue, came, to, be, used, only, in, the, new, kingdom, period, ancient, egyptians, invented, the, art, of, veneering, and, used, varnishes, for, finishing, though, the, composition, of, these, varnishes, is, unknown, although, different, native, acacias, were, used, as, was, the, wood, from, the, local, sycamore, and, tamarisk, trees, deforestation, in, the, nile, valley, resulted, in, the, need, for, the, importation, of, wood, notably, cedar, but, also, aleppo, pine, boxwood, and, oak, starting, from, the, second, dynasty, woodworking, was, essential, to, the, romans, it, provided, material, for, buildings, transportation, tools, and, household, items, wood, also, provided, pipes, dye, waterproofing, materials, and, energy, for, heat, 1, although, most, examples, of, roman, woodworking, have, been, lost, 2, the, literary, record, preserved, much, of, the, contemporary, knowledge, vitruvius, dedicates, an, entire, chapter, of, his, de, architectura, to, timber, preserving, many, details, pliny, while, not, a, botanist, dedicated, six, books, of, his, natural, history, to, trees, and, woody, plants, providing, a, wealth, of, information, on, trees, and, their, uses, the, progenitors, of, chinese, woodworking, are, considered, to, be, lu, ban, and, his, wife, lady, yun, from, the, spring, and, autumn, period, 771, to, 476, bc, lu, ban, is, said, to, have, introduced, the, plane, chalk, line, and, other, tools, to, china, his, teachings, were, supposedly, left, behind, in, the, book, lu, ban, jing, manuscript, of, lu, ban, despite, this, it, is, believed, that, the, text, was, written, some, 1500, years, after, his, death, this, book, is, filled, largely, with, descriptions, of, dimensions, for, use, in, building, various, items, such, as, flower, pots, tables, altars, etc, and, also, contains, extensive, instructions, concerning, feng, shui, it, mentions, almost, nothing, of, the, intricate, glue, less, and, nail, less, joinery, for, which, chinese, furniture, was, so, famous, with, the, advances, in, modern, technology, and, the, demands, of, industry, woodwork, as, a, field, has, changed, the, development, of, computer, numeric, controlled, cnc, machines, for, example, has, made, it, possible, to, mass, produce, and, reproduce, products, faster, with, less, waste, and, often, with, more, complex, design, than, ever, before, cnc, wood, routers, can, carve, complicated, and, highly, detailed, shapes, into, flat, stock, to, create, signs, or, art, rechargeable, power, tools, speed, up, creation, of, many, projects, and, require, much, less, body, strength, than, in, the, past, for, example, when, boring, multiple, holes, skilled, fine, woodworking, however, remains, a, craft, pursued, by, many, there, remains, demand, for, hand, crafted, work, such, as, furniture, and, arts, however, with, rate, and, cost, of, production, the, cost, for, consumers, is, much, higher, modern, woodcarving, usually, refers, to, works, of, wood, art, produced, by, woodcarvers, in, the, form, of, contemporary, art, this, type, of, wood, carving, often, combines, traditional, techniques, with, more, modern, artistic, styles, and, concepts, modern, woodcarving, can, be, produced, in, a, variety, of, forms, and, styles, from, realist, to, abstract, carvings, and, often, uses, unusual, wood, materials, such, as, rainwood, or, wood, with, unique, textures, to, highlight, the, uniqueness, of, the, work, in, recent, years, the, art, of, modern, wood, carving, has, become, increasingly, popular, among, woodworkers, and, visual, art, enthusiasts, not, only, in, asia, but, also, around, the, world, modern, woodcarving, art, is, often, exhibited, in, art, galleries, and, museums, and, can, be, seen, in, several, global, contemporary, art, exhibitions, woodworking, especially, furniture, making, has, many, different, designs, styles, throughout, its, history, woodworking, designs, and, styles, have, changed, some, of, the, more, common, styles, are, listed, below, traditional, furniture, styles, usually, include, styles, that, have, been, around, for, long, periods, of, time, and, have, shown, a, mark, of, wealth, and, luxury, for, centuries, more, modern, furniture, styles, are, commonly, used, over, the, past, few, hundred, years, see, also, wood, properties, and, tonewood, properties, historically, woodworkers, relied, upon, the, woods, native, to, their, region, until, transportation, and, trade, innovations, made, more, exotic, woods, available, to, the, craftsman, woods, are, typically, sorted, into, three, basic, types, hardwoods, typified, by, tight, grain, and, derived, from, broadleaf, trees, softwoods, from, coniferous, trees, and, man, made, materials, such, as, plywood, and, mdf, hardwoods, botanically, known, as, angiosperms, are, deciduous, and, shed, their, leaves, annually, with, temperature, changes, softwoods, come, from, trees, botanically, known, as, gymnosperms, which, are, coniferous, cone, bearing, and, stay, green, year, round, although, a, general, pattern, softwoods, are, not, necessarily, always, softer, than, hardwoods, and, vice, versa, softwood, is, most, commonly, found, in, the, regions, of, the, world, with, lower, temperatures, and, is, typically, less, durable, lighter, in, weight, and, more, vulnerable, to, pests, and, fungal, attacks, in, comparison, to, hardwoods, they, typically, have, a, paler, color, and, a, more, open, grain, than, hardwoods, which, contributes, to, the, tendency, of, felled, softwood, to, shrink, and, swell, as, it, dries, softwoods, usually, have, a, lower, density, around, 432, 592, kg, m, 3, which, can, compromise, its, strength, density, however, does, vary, within, both, softwoods, and, hardwoods, depending, on, the, wood, s, geographical, origin, and, growth, rate, however, the, lower, density, of, softwoods, also, allows, it, to, have, a, greater, strength, with, lighter, weight, in, the, united, states, softwoods, are, typically, cheaper, and, more, readily, available, and, accessible, most, softwoods, are, suitable, for, general, construction, especially, framing, trim, and, finish, work, and, carcassing, hardwoods, are, separated, into, two, categories, temperate, and, tropical, hardwoods, depending, on, their, origin, temperate, hardwoods, are, found, in, the, regions, between, the, tropics, and, poles, and, are, of, particular, interest, to, wood, workers, for, their, cost, effective, aesthetic, appeal, and, sustainable, sources, tropical, hardwoods, are, found, within, the, equatorial, belt, including, africa, asia, and, south, america, hardwoods, flaunt, a, higher, density, around, 1041, kg, m, 3, as, a, result, of, slower, growing, rates, and, is, more, stable, when, drying, as, a, result, of, its, high, density, hardwoods, are, typically, heavier, than, softwoods, but, can, also, be, more, brittle, while, there, are, an, abundant, number, of, hardwood, species, only, 200, are, common, enough, and, pliable, enough, to, be, used, for, woodworking, hardwoods, have, a, wide, variety, of, properties, making, it, easy, to, find, a, hardwood, to, suit, nearly, any, purpose, but, they, are, especially, suitable, for, outdoor, use, due, to, their, strength, and, resilience, to, rot, and, decay, the, coloring, of, hardwoods, ranges, from, light, to, very, dark, making, it, especially, versatile, for, aesthetic, purposes, however, because, hardwoods, are, more, closely, grained, they, are, typically, harder, to, work, than, softwoods, they, are, also, harder, to, acquire, in, the, united, states, and, as, a, result, are, more, expensive, typically, furniture, such, as, tables, and, chairs, is, made, using, solid, stock, from, hardwoods, due, to, its, strength, and, resistance, to, warping, additionally, they, also, have, a, greater, variety, of, grain, patterns, and, color, and, take, a, finish, better, which, allows, the, woodworker, to, exercise, a, great, deal, of, artistic, liberty, hardwoods, can, be, cut, more, cleanly, and, leave, less, residue, on, sawblades, and, other, woodworking, tools, cabinet, fixture, makers, employ, the, use, of, plywood, and, other, man, made, panel, products, some, furniture, such, as, the, windsor, chair, involve, green, woodworking, shaping, with, wood, while, it, contains, its, natural, moisture, prior, to, drying, cedars, are, strong, aromatic, softwoods, that, are, capable, of, enduring, outdoor, elements, the, most, common, of, which, is, the, western, red, cedar, western, red, cedar, can, sustain, wet, environments, without, succumbing, to, rot, and, as, a, result, is, commonly, used, for, outdoor, projects, such, as, patios, outdoor, furniture, and, building, exteriors, this, wood, can, be, easily, found, at, most, home, centers, in, the, us, and, canada, for, a, moderate, price, within, the, usa, fir, also, known, as, douglas, fir, is, inexpensive, and, common, at, local, home, centers, it, has, a, characteristic, straight, pronounced, grain, with, a, red, brown, tint, however, its, grain, pattern, is, relatively, plain, and, it, does, not, stain, well, so, fir, is, commonly, used, when, the, finished, product, will, be, painted, while, commonly, used, for, building, this, softwood, would, also, be, suitable, for, furniture, making, white, pine, ponderosa, and, southern, yellow, pine, are, common, species, used, in, furniture, making, white, pine, and, ponderosa, are, typically, used, for, indoor, projects, while, southern, yellow, pine, is, recommended, for, outdoor, projects, due, to, its, durability, this, hardwood, is, relatively, easy, to, work, with, and, takes, stain, well, but, its, white, to, light, brown, color, with, a, straight, grain, is, visually, appealing, on, its, own, however, ash, is, much, more, difficult, to, find, than, other, common, woods, and, will, not, be, found, at, the, local, home, center, larger, lumber, yards, should, have, it, in, stock, hardwood, of, the, european, species, fagus, sylvatica, is, widely, used, for, furniture, framing, and, carcase, construction, in, plywood, musical, instruments, drum, shells, and, piano, blocks, and, turned, items, like, knobs, whether, yellow, or, white, birch, these, hardwoods, are, stable, and, easy, to, work, with, despite, this, birch, is, prone, to, blotching, when, stained, so, painting, birch, products, is, probably, best, birch, is, easily, found, at, many, home, centers, and, is, a, relatively, inexpensive, hardwood, popular, and, easy, to, work, with, cherry, is, in, high, demand, for, its, reddish, brown, color, and, ease, of, staining, and, finishing, cherry, likely, will, not, be, at, the, local, home, center, but, should, be, at, a, lumberyard, for, a, somewhat, expensive, price, this, hardwood, is, a, very, common, material, for, furniture, and, is, resistant, to, normal, wear, and, tear, but, it, is, best, for, indoor, pieces, a, hardwood, mahogany, has, a, trademark, reddish, brown, to, deep, red, tint, and, is, known, as, one, of, the, great, furniture, woods, however, mahogany, is, not, typically, grown, in, sustainable, forests, and, thus, runs, a, steep, price, at, local, lumber, yards, with, two, varieties, red, and, white, oak, is, known, to, be, easy, to, work, with, and, relatively, strong, however, furniture, makers, often, opt, for, white, oak, over, red, oak, for, its, attractive, figure, and, moisture, resistance, depending, on, the, kind, needed, oak, can, probably, be, found, at, a, local, home, center, or, a, lumberyard, for, a, bit, pricier, than, other, hardwoods, with, strength, sturdiness, and, durability, maple, is, a, common, material, for, furniture, for, the, bedroom, and, even, china, cabinets, maple, is, moisture, resistant, and, frequently, displays, stand, out, swirls, in, the, wood, grain, an, aesthetically, pleasing, differentiator, from, other, hardwoods, while, most, commonly, a, lighter, color, maple, also, can, take, stains, and, paint, well, there, are, many, factors, to, consider, when, deciding, what, type, of, wood, to, use, for, a, project, one, of, the, most, important, is, the, workability, of, the, wood, the, way, in, which, it, responds, when, worked, by, hand, or, tools, the, quality, of, the, grain, and, how, it, responds, to, adhesives, and, finishes, when, the, workability, of, wood, is, high, it, offers, a, lower, resistance, when, cutting, and, has, a, diminished, blunting, effect, on, tools, highly, workable, wood, is, easier, to, manipulate, into, desired, forms, if, the, wood, grain, is, straight, and, even, it, will, be, much, easier, to, create, strong, and, durable, glued, joints, additionally, it, will, help, protect, the, wood, from, splitting, when, nailed, or, screwed, coarse, grains, require, a, lengthy, process, of, filing, and, rubbing, down, the, grain, to, produce, a, smooth, result, another, important, factor, is, the, durability, of, the, wood, especially, in, regards, to, moisture, if, the, finished, project, will, be, exposed, to, moisture, e, g, outdoor, projects, or, high, humidity, or, condensation, e, g, in, kitchens, or, bathrooms, then, the, wood, needs, to, be, especially, durable, in, order, to, prevent, rot, because, of, their, oily, qualities, many, tropical, hardwoods, such, as, teak, and, mahogany, are, popular, for, such, applications, while, many, woods, can, be, used, for, carving, there, are, some, clear, favorites, including, aspen, basswood, butternut, black, walnut, and, oak, because, it, has, almost, no, grain, and, is, notably, soft, basswood, is, particularly, popular, with, beginner, carvers, it, is, used, in, many, lower, cost, instruments, like, guitars, and, electric, basses, aspen, is, similarly, soft, although, slightly, harder, and, readily, available, and, inexpensive, butternut, has, a, deeper, hue, than, basswood, and, aspen, and, has, a, nice, grain, that, is, easy, to, carve, and, thus, friendly, for, beginners, it, is, also, suitable, for, furniture, while, more, expensive, than, basswood, aspen, and, butternut, black, walnut, is, a, popular, choice, for, its, rich, color, and, grain, lastly, oak, is, a, strong, sturdy, and, versatile, wood, for, carving, with, a, defined, grain, it, is, also, a, popular, wood, for, furniture, making, each, area, of, woodworking, requires, a, different, variation, of, tools, power, tools, and, hand, tools, are, both, used, for, woodworking, many, modern, woodworkers, choose, to, use, power, tools, in, their, trade, for, the, added, ease, and, to, save, time, however, many, woodworkers, still, choose, to, use, only, hand, tools, for, several, reasons, such, as, tradition, the, experience, and, the, added, character, to, the, work, while, some, choose, to, use, only, hand, tools, simply, for, their, own, enjoyment, hand, tools, are, classified, as, tools, that, receive, power, only, from, the, hands, that, are, holding, them, edged, hand, woodworking, tools, need, to, be, sharpened, which, is, done, using, the, sharpening, jig, and, sharpening, stone, a, more, novel, method, involves, the, use, of, sandpaper, the, more, common, modern, hand, tools, are, power, tools, are, tools, that, are, powered, by, an, external, energy, such, as, a, battery, motor, or, a, power, cable, connected, to, a, wall, outlet, the, more, common, power, tools, are
