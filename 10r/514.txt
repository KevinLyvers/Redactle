a, battle, axe, also, battle, axe, battle, ax, or, battle, ax, is, an, axe, specifically, designed, for, combat, battle, axes, were, specialized, versions, of, utility, axes, many, were, suitable, for, use, in, one, hand, while, others, were, larger, and, were, deployed, two, handed, axes, designed, for, warfare, ranged, in, weight, from, just, over, 0, 5, to, 3, kg, 1, to, 7, lb, and, in, length, from, just, over, 30, cm, 1, ft, to, upwards, of, 150, cm, 5, ft, as, in, the, case, of, the, danish, axe, or, the, sparth, axe, cleaving, weapons, longer, than, 150, cm, 5, ft, would, arguably, fall, into, the, category, of, polearms, through, the, course, of, human, history, commonplace, objects, have, been, pressed, into, service, as, weapons, axes, by, virtue, of, their, ubiquity, are, no, exception, besides, axes, designed, for, combat, there, were, many, battle, axes, that, doubled, as, tools, axes, could, be, modified, into, deadly, projectiles, as, well, see, the, francisca, for, an, example, axes, were, often, cheaper, than, swords, and, considerably, more, available, battle, axes, generally, weigh, far, less, than, modern, splitting, axes, especially, mauls, because, they, were, designed, to, cut, legs, and, arms, rather, than, wood, consequently, slightly, narrow, slicing, blades, are, the, norm, this, facilitates, deep, devastating, wounds, moreover, a, lighter, weapon, is, much, quicker, to, bring, to, bear, in, combat, and, manipulate, for, repeated, strikes, against, an, adversary, the, crescent, shaped, heads, of, european, battle, axes, of, the, roman, and, post, roman, periods, were, usually, made, of, wrought, iron, with, a, carbon, steel, edge, or, as, time, elapsed, across, the, many, centuries, of, the, medieval, era, steel, the, hardwood, handles, of, military, axes, came, to, be, reinforced, with, metal, bands, called, langets, so, that, an, enemy, warrior, could, not, cut, the, shaft, some, later, specimens, had, all, metal, handles, battle, axes, are, particularly, associated, in, western, popular, imagination, with, the, vikings, certainly, scandinavian, foot, soldiers, and, maritime, marauders, employed, them, as, a, stock, weapon, during, their, heyday, which, extended, from, the, beginning, of, the, 8th, century, to, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, they, produced, several, varieties, including, specialized, throwing, axes, see, francisca, and, bearded, axes, or, skeggox, so, named, for, their, trailing, lower, blade, edge, which, increased, cleaving, power, and, could, be, used, to, catch, the, edge, of, an, opponent, s, shield, and, pull, it, down, leaving, the, shield, bearer, vulnerable, to, a, follow, up, blow, viking, axes, may, have, been, wielded, with, one, hand, or, two, depending, on, the, length, of, the, plain, wooden, haft, see, viking, age, arms, and, armor, stone, hand, axes, were, in, use, in, the, paleolithic, period, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, the, first, hafted, stone, axes, appear, to, have, been, produced, about, 6000, bce, during, the, mesolithic, period, technological, development, continued, in, the, neolithic, period, with, the, much, wider, usage, of, hard, stones, in, addition, to, flint, and, chert, and, the, widespread, use, of, polishing, to, improve, axe, properties, the, axes, proved, critical, in, wood, working, and, became, cult, objects, for, example, the, entry, for, the, battle, axe, people, of, scandinavia, treated, their, axes, as, high, status, cultural, objects, such, stone, axes, were, made, from, a, wide, variety, of, tough, rocks, such, as, picrite, and, other, igneous, or, metamorphic, rocks, and, were, widespread, in, the, neolithic, period, many, axe, heads, found, were, probably, used, primarily, as, mauls, to, split, wood, beams, and, as, sledgehammers, for, construction, purposes, such, hammering, stakes, into, the, ground, for, example, narrow, axe, heads, made, of, cast, metals, were, subsequently, manufactured, by, artisans, in, the, middle, east, and, then, europe, during, the, copper, age, and, the, bronze, age, the, earliest, specimens, were, socket, less, more, specifically, bronze, battle, axe, heads, are, attested, in, the, archaeological, record, from, ancient, china, and, the, new, kingdom, of, ancient, egypt, some, of, them, were, suited, for, practical, use, as, infantry, weapons, while, others, were, clearly, intended, to, be, brandished, as, symbols, of, status, and, authority, judging, by, the, quality, of, their, decoration, the, epsilon, axe, was, widely, used, during, the, bronze, age, by, irregular, infantry, unable, to, afford, better, weapons, its, use, was, limited, to, europe, and, the, middle, east, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, during, the, iron, age, the, double, bladed, labrys, axe, was, prevalent, and, a, hafted, single, bitted, axe, made, of, bronze, or, later, iron, was, sometimes, used, as, a, weapon, of, war, by, the, heavy, infantry, of, ancient, greece, especially, when, confronted, with, thickly, armored, opponents, the, sagaris, described, as, either, single, bitted, or, double, bitted, became, associated, by, the, greeks, with, the, mythological, amazons, though, these, were, generally, ceremonial, axes, rather, than, practical, implements, the, barbarian, tribes, that, the, romans, encountered, north, of, the, alps, did, include, iron, war, axes, in, their, armories, alongside, swords, and, spears, the, cantabri, from, the, iberian, peninsula, also, used, battle, axes, battle, axes, were, very, common, in, europe, in, the, migration, period, and, the, subsequent, viking, age, and, they, famously, figure, on, the, 11th, century, bayeux, tapestry, which, depicts, norman, mounted, knights, pitted, against, anglo, saxon, infantrymen, they, continued, to, be, employed, throughout, the, rest, of, the, middle, ages, with, significant, combatants, being, noted, axe, wielders, in, the, 12th, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, king, stephen, of, england, famously, used, a, dane, axe, at, the, battle, of, lincoln, 1141, one, account, says, that, he, used, it, after, his, sword, broke, another, says, he, used, his, sword, only, after, his, axe, broke, richard, the, lionheart, was, often, recorded, in, victorian, times, wielding, a, large, war, axe, though, references, are, sometimes, wildly, exaggerated, as, befitted, a, national, hero, long, and, long, after, he, was, quiet, in, his, grave, his, terrible, battle, axe, with, twenty, english, pounds, of, english, steel, in, its, mighty, head, a, child, s, history, of, england, by, charles, dickens, richard, is, however, recorded, as, using, a, danish, axe, at, the, relief, of, jaffa, geoffrey, of, lusignan, is, another, famous, crusader, associated, with, the, axe, robert, the, bruce, king, of, scotland, used, an, axe, to, defeat, henry, de, bohun, in, single, combat, at, the, start, of, the, battle, of, bannockburn, in, 1314, given, that, bruce, was, wielding, the, axe, on, horseback, it, is, likely, that, it, was, a, one, handed, horseman, s, axe, they, enjoyed, a, sustained, revival, among, heavily, armored, equestrian, combatants, in, the, 15th, century, in, the, 14th, century, the, use, of, axes, is, increasingly, noted, by, froissart, in, his, chronicle, which, records, the, engagements, between, the, kingdoms, of, france, and, england, and, the, rise, of, professional, and, mercenary, armies, in, the, 14th, century, king, john, ii, is, recorded, as, using, one, at, the, battle, of, poitiers, in, 1356, and, sir, james, douglas, at, the, battle, of, otterburn, in, 1388, bretons, were, apparently, noted, axe, users, with, noted, mercenaries, bertrand, du, guesclin, and, olivier, de, clisson, both, wielding, axes, in, battle, in, these, instances, the, type, of, battle, axe, whether, a, danish, axe, or, the, proto, pollaxe, is, not, recorded, most, medieval, european, battle, axes, had, a, socketed, head, meaning, that, the, thicker, butt, end, of, the, blade, contained, an, opening, into, which, a, wooden, haft, was, inserted, and, some, included, langets, long, strips, of, metal, affixed, to, the, faces, of, the, haft, to, prevent, it, from, being, damaged, during, combat, occasionally, the, cheeks, of, the, axehead, bore, engraved, etched, punched, or, inlaid, decorative, patterns, late, period, battle, axes, tended, to, be, of, all, metal, construction, such, medieval, polearms, as, the, halberd, and, the, pollaxe, were, variants, of, the, basic, battle, axe, form, steel, plate, armor, covering, almost, all, of, a, knight, s, body, and, incorporating, features, specifically, designed, to, defeat, axe, and, sword, blades, become, more, common, in, the, late, 14th, and, early, 15th, century, its, development, led, to, a, generation, of, hafted, weapons, with, points, that, concentrated, impact, either, to, penetrate, steel, plate, or, to, damage, the, joints, of, articulated, plate, increasingly, daggers, called, misericords, were, carried, which, enabled, a, sharp, point, to, be, thrust, though, gaps, in, armour, if, an, opponent, was, disabled, or, being, grappled, with, swords, styles, became, more, diverse, from, the, two, handed, zweih, nders, to, more, narrow, thrusting, instruments, with, sharply, pointed, tips, capable, of, penetrating, any, chinks, in, the, armour, of, a, fully, encased, opponent, for, example, the, estoc, the, newly, invented, flanged, mace, for, example, was, no, crude, bludgeon, like, its, predecessors, the, vertical, flanges, projecting, at, regular, intervals, from, its, head, could, fracture, plate, armor, and, smash, into, underlying, body, tissue, yet, it, was, a, much, cheaper, weapon, to, make, than, a, sword, whose, blade, was, inclined, in, any, case, to, glance, harmlessly, off, the, smooth, curved, plates, of, a, well, designed, suit, of, armor, if, used, in, a, chopping, manner, a, sharp, sometimes, curved, pick, was, often, fitted, to, the, rear, of, the, battle, axe, s, blade, to, provide, the, user, with, a, secondary, weapon, of, penetration, a, stabbing, spike, could, be, added, too, as, a, finial, similarly, the, war, hammer, evolved, in, late, medieval, times, with, fluted, or, spiked, heads, which, would, help, a, strike, to, bite, into, the, armour, and, deliver, its, energy, through, to, the, wearer, rather, than, glance, off, the, armor, s, surface, strikes, from, these, armour, penetrating, picks, were, not, always, fatal, there, are, many, accounts, of, plate, armored, knights, being, struck, with, said, weapons, and, while, the, armour, was, damaged, the, individual, underneath, survived, and, in, some, cases, completely, unharmed, it, eventually, became, common, for, these, various, kinds, of, impact, weapons, to, be, made, entirely, from, metal, thus, doing, away, with, reinforced, wooden, shafts, a, useful, visual, guide, to, high, medieval, battle, axes, contemporary, with, their, employment, are, the, scenes, of, warfare, depicted, in, the, maciejowski, bible, morgan, bible, of, c, 1250, battle, axes, also, came, to, figure, as, heraldic, devices, on, the, coats, of, arms, of, several, english, and, mainland, european, families, battle, axes, were, eventually, phased, out, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, as, military, tactics, began, to, revolve, increasingly, around, the, use, of, gunpowder, however, as, late, as, the, 1640s, prince, rupert, a, royalist, general, and, cavalry, commander, during, the, english, civil, war, is, pictured, carrying, a, battle, axe, and, this, was, not, merely, a, decorative, symbol, of, authority, the, short, pole, axe, was, adopted, by, royalist, cavalry, officers, to, penetrate, roundhead, troopers, helmets, and, cuirasses, in, close, quarters, fighting, and, it, was, also, used, by, their, opponents, sir, bevil, grenville, was, slain, by, a, parliamentarian, pole, axe, at, the, battle, of, lansdowne, and, sir, richard, bulstrode, was, wounded, by, one, at, the, battle, of, edgehill, in, scandinavia, however, the, battle, axe, continued, in, use, alongside, the, halberd, crossbow, and, pole, axe, until, the, start, of, the, 18th, century, the, nature, of, norwegian, terrain, in, particular, made, pike, and, shot, tactics, impracticable, in, many, cases, a, law, instituted, in, 1604, required, all, farmers, to, own, weaponry, to, serve, in, the, militia, the, norwegian, peasant, militia, battle, axe, much, more, wieldy, than, the, pike, or, halberd, and, yet, effective, against, mounted, enemies, was, a, popular, choice, many, such, weapons, were, ornately, decorated, and, yet, their, functionality, shows, in, the, way, that, the, axe, head, was, mounted, tilting, upwards, slightly, with, a, significant, forward, curve, in, the, shaft, with, the, intent, of, making, them, more, effective, against, armoured, opponents, by, concentrating, force, onto, a, narrower, spot, during, napoleonic, times, and, later, on, in, the, 19th, century, farriers, in, army, service, carried, long, and, heavy, axes, as, part, of, their, kit, although, these, could, be, used, in, an, emergency, for, fighting, their, primary, use, was, logistical, the, branded, hooves, of, deceased, military, horses, needed, to, be, removed, in, order, to, prove, that, they, had, indeed, died, and, had, not, been, stolen, napoleon, s, pioneer, corps, also, carried, axes, that, were, used, for, clearing, vegetation, a, practice, employed, by, similar, units, in, other, armies, the, tabarzin, persian, lit, saddle, axe, or, saddle, hatchet, is, the, traditional, battle, axe, of, persia, it, bears, one, or, two, crescent, shaped, blades, the, long, form, of, the, tabar, was, about, seven, feet, long, while, a, shorter, version, was, about, three, feet, long, what, made, the, persian, axe, unique, is, the, very, thin, handle, which, is, very, light, and, always, metallic, the, tabar, became, one, of, the, main, weapons, throughout, the, middle, east, and, was, always, carried, at, a, soldier, s, waist, not, only, in, persia, but, egypt, and, the, arab, world, from, the, time, of, the, crusades, mamluk, bodyguards, were, known, as, tabardiyya, after, the, weapon, the, tabarzin, is, sometimes, carried, as, a, symbolic, weapon, by, wandering, dervishes, muslim, ascetic, worshippers, different, types, of, battleaxes, may, be, found, in, ancient, china, in, chinese, mythology, xingtian, a, deity, uses, a, battle, axe, against, other, gods, the, qi, and, yue, are, heavy, axes, they, were, common, in, zhou, dynasty, but, fell, out, of, favor, with, users, due, to, the, lack, of, mobility, the, eventually, became, used, only, for, ceremonial, purposes, and, such, battleaxes, made, of, bronze, and, jade, have, been, found, the, dagger, axe, ge, is, another, form, used, in, ancient, times, chinese, battleaxes, can, be, divided, in, three, subgroups, fu, yue, and, ge, the, distinction, between, a, yue, and, a, fu, is, that, a, yue, is, as, a, general, rule, broader, than, a, fu, in, the, shang, dynasty, the, yue, was, also, a, symbol, of, power, the, bigger, the, yue, the, greater, the, power, there, are, a, few, rare, examples, of, yue, with, a, round, blade, and, a, hole, in, the, middle, the, chinese, fu, appeared, in, the, stone, age, as, a, tool, in, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, c, 1060, bce, the, fu, began, to, be, made, from, bronze, and, began, to, be, used, as, a, weapon, however, the, prominence, of, the, fu, waned, on, the, battlefield, as, the, zhou, dynasty, came, to, power, in, the, warring, states, era, iron, axes, started, to, appear, up, until, the, han, and, jin, dynasty, after, having, lost, its, importance, on, the, battle, field, the, fu, once, again, appeared, as, the, cavalry, was, used, more, often, in, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, there, is, evidence, of, the, subdivision, of, the, fu, during, the, song, dynasty, axes, were, popularized, and, many, types, of, axes, began, to, exist, the, types, include, phoenix, head, axes, feng, tou, fu, invincible,
