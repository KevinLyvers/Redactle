leather, is, a, strong, flexible, and, durable, material, obtained, from, the, tanning, or, chemical, treatment, of, animal, skins, and, hides, to, prevent, decay, the, most, common, leathers, come, from, cattle, sheep, goats, equine, animals, buffalo, pigs, and, hogs, and, aquatic, animals, such, as, seals, and, alligators, leather, can, be, used, to, make, a, variety, of, items, including, clothing, footwear, handbags, furniture, tools, and, sports, equipment, and, lasts, for, decades, leather, making, has, been, practiced, for, more, than, 7, 000, years, and, the, leading, producers, of, leather, today, are, china, and, india, critics, of, tanneries, claim, that, they, engage, in, unsustainable, practices, that, pose, health, hazards, to, the, people, and, the, environment, near, them, the, leather, manufacturing, process, is, divided, into, three, fundamental, subprocesses, preparatory, stages, tanning, and, crusting, a, further, subprocess, finishing, can, be, added, into, the, leather, process, sequence, but, not, all, leathers, receive, finishing, the, preparatory, stages, are, when, the, hide, is, prepared, for, tanning, preparatory, stages, may, include, soaking, hair, removal, liming, deliming, bating, bleaching, and, pickling, tanning, is, a, process, that, stabilizes, the, proteins, particularly, collagen, of, the, raw, hide, to, increase, the, thermal, chemical, and, microbiological, stability, of, the, hides, and, skins, making, it, suitable, for, a, wide, variety, of, end, applications, the, principal, difference, between, raw, and, tanned, hides, is, that, raw, hides, dry, out, to, form, a, hard, inflexible, material, that, when, rewetted, will, putrefy, while, tanned, material, dries, to, a, flexible, form, that, does, not, become, putrid, when, rewetted, many, tanning, methods, and, materials, exist, the, typical, process, sees, tanners, load, the, hides, into, a, drum, and, immerse, them, in, a, tank, that, contains, the, tanning, liquor, the, hides, soak, while, the, drum, slowly, rotates, about, its, axis, and, the, tanning, liquor, slowly, penetrates, through, the, full, thickness, of, the, hide, once, the, process, achieves, even, penetration, workers, slowly, raise, the, liquor, s, ph, in, a, process, called, basification, which, fixes, the, tanning, material, to, the, leather, the, more, tanning, material, fixed, the, higher, the, leather, s, hydrothermal, stability, and, shrinkage, temperature, resistance, crusting, is, a, process, that, thins, and, lubricates, leather, it, often, includes, a, coloring, operation, chemicals, added, during, crusting, must, be, fixed, in, place, crusting, culminates, with, a, drying, and, softening, operation, and, may, include, splitting, shaving, dyeing, whitening, or, other, methods, for, some, leathers, tanners, apply, a, surface, coating, called, finishing, finishing, operations, can, include, oiling, brushing, buffing, coating, polishing, embossing, glazing, or, tumbling, among, others, leather, can, be, oiled, to, improve, its, water, resistance, this, currying, process, after, tanning, supplements, the, natural, oils, remaining, in, the, leather, itself, which, can, be, washed, out, through, repeated, exposure, to, water, frequent, oiling, of, leather, with, mink, oil, neatsfoot, oil, or, a, similar, material, keeps, it, supple, and, improves, its, lifespan, dramatically, tanning, processes, largely, differ, in, which, chemicals, are, used, in, the, tanning, liquor, some, common, types, include, in, general, leather, is, produced, in, the, following, grades, the, term, genuine, leather, does, not, describe, a, specific, grade, the, term, often, indicates, split, leather, that, has, been, extensively, processed, and, some, sources, describe, it, as, synonymous, with, bicast, leather, or, made, from, multiple, splits, glued, together, and, coated, in, some, countries, when, it, is, the, description, on, a, product, label, the, term, means, nothing, more, than, contains, leather, depending, on, jurisdiction, regulations, limit, the, term, s, use, in, product, labelling, today, most, leather, is, made, of, cattle, cow, hides, which, constitute, about, 65, of, all, leather, produced, other, animals, that, are, used, include, sheep, about, 13, goats, about, 11, and, pigs, about, 10, obtaining, accurate, figures, from, around, the, world, is, difficult, especially, for, areas, where, the, skin, may, be, eaten, there, are, significant, regional, differences, in, leather, production, i, e, goat, leather, was, historically, called, turkey, or, morocco, due, to, its, association, with, the, middle, east, while, pig, skin, had, historically, been, used, the, most, in, germany, other, animals, mentioned, below, only, constitute, a, fraction, of, a, percent, of, total, leather, production, horse, hides, are, used, to, make, particularly, durable, leathers, shell, cordovan, is, a, horse, leather, made, not, from, the, outer, skin, but, from, an, under, layer, found, only, in, equine, species, called, the, shell, it, is, prized, for, its, mirror, like, finish, and, anti, creasing, properties, lamb, and, deerskin, are, used, for, soft, leather, in, more, expensive, apparel, deerskin, is, widely, used, in, work, gloves, and, indoor, shoes, reptilian, skins, such, as, alligator, crocodile, and, snake, are, noted, for, their, distinct, patterns, that, reflect, the, scales, of, their, species, this, has, led, to, hunting, and, farming, of, these, species, in, part, for, their, skins, the, argentine, black, and, white, tegu, is, one, of, the, most, exploited, reptile, species, in, the, world, in, the, leather, trade, however, it, is, not, endangered, and, while, monitored, trade, is, legal, in, most, south, american, countries, kangaroo, leather, is, used, to, make, items, that, must, be, strong, and, flexible, it, is, the, material, most, commonly, used, in, bullwhips, some, motorcyclists, favor, kangaroo, leather, for, motorcycle, leathers, because, of, its, light, weight, and, abrasion, resistance, kangaroo, leather, is, also, used, for, falconry, jesses, soccer, footwear, e, g, adidas, copa, mundial, and, boxing, speed, bags, although, originally, raised, for, their, feathers, in, the, 19th, century, ostriches, are, now, more, popular, for, both, meat, and, leather, ostrich, leather, has, a, characteristic, goose, bump, look, because, of, the, large, follicles, where, the, feathers, grew, different, processes, produce, different, finishes, for, many, applications, including, upholstery, footwear, automotive, products, accessories, and, clothing, in, thailand, stingray, leather, is, used, in, wallets, and, belts, stingray, leather, is, tough, and, durable, the, leather, is, often, dyed, black, and, covered, with, tiny, round, bumps, in, the, natural, pattern, of, the, back, ridge, of, an, animal, these, bumps, are, then, usually, dyed, white, to, highlight, the, decoration, stingray, rawhide, is, also, used, as, grips, on, chinese, swords, scottish, basket, hilted, swords, and, japanese, katanas, stingray, leather, is, also, used, for, high, abrasion, areas, in, motorcycle, racing, leathers, especially, in, gloves, where, its, high, abrasion, resistance, helps, prevent, wear, through, in, the, event, of, an, accident, for, a, given, thickness, fish, leather, is, typically, much, stronger, due, to, its, criss, crossed, fibers, leather, produces, some, environmental, impact, most, notably, due, to, estimates, of, the, carbon, footprint, of, bovine, leather, range, from, 65, to, 150, kg, of, co, 2, equivalent, per, square, meter, of, production, one, ton, of, hide, or, skin, generally, produces, 20, to, 80, m, 3, of, waste, water, including, chromium, levels, of, 100, 400, mg, l, sulfide, levels, of, 200, 800, mg, l, high, levels, of, fat, and, other, solid, wastes, and, notable, pathogen, contamination, producers, often, add, pesticides, to, protect, hides, during, transport, with, solid, wastes, representing, up, to, 70, of, the, wet, weight, of, the, original, hides, the, tanning, process, represents, a, considerable, strain, on, water, treatment, installations, leather, biodegrades, slowly, taking, 25, to, 40, years, to, decompose, however, vinyl, and, petrochemical, derived, materials, take, 500, or, more, years, to, decompose, tanning, is, especially, polluting, in, countries, where, environmental, regulations, are, lax, such, as, in, india, the, world, s, third, largest, producer, and, exporter, of, leather, to, give, an, example, of, an, efficient, pollution, prevention, system, chromium, loads, per, produced, tonne, are, generally, abated, from, 8, kg, to, 1, 5, kg, voc, emissions, are, typically, reduced, from, 30, kg, t, to, 2, kg, t, in, a, properly, managed, facility, a, review, of, the, total, pollution, load, decrease, achievable, according, to, the, united, nations, industrial, development, organization, posts, precise, data, on, the, abatement, achievable, through, industrially, proven, low, waste, advanced, methods, while, noting, even, though, the, chrome, pollution, load, can, be, decreased, by, 94, on, introducing, advanced, technologies, the, minimum, residual, load, 0, 15, kg, t, raw, hide, can, still, cause, difficulties, when, using, landfills, and, composting, sludge, from, wastewater, treatment, on, account, of, the, regulations, currently, in, force, in, some, countries, in, kanpur, the, self, proclaimed, leather, city, of, world, with, 10, 000, tanneries, as, of, 2011, and, a, city, of, three, million, on, the, banks, of, the, ganges, pollution, levels, were, so, high, that, despite, an, industry, crisis, the, pollution, control, board, decided, to, shut, down, 49, high, polluting, tanneries, out, of, 404, in, july, 2009, in, 2003, for, instance, the, main, tanneries, effluent, disposal, unit, was, dumping, 22, tonnes, of, chromium, laden, solid, waste, per, day, in, the, open, in, the, hazaribagh, neighborhood, of, dhaka, in, bangladesh, chemicals, from, tanneries, end, up, in, dhaka, s, main, river, besides, the, environmental, damage, the, health, of, both, local, factory, workers, and, the, end, consumer, is, also, negatively, affected, after, approximately, 15, years, of, ignoring, high, court, rulings, the, government, shut, down, more, than, 100, tanneries, the, weekend, of, 8, april, 2017, in, the, neighborhood, the, higher, cost, associated, with, the, treatment, of, effluents, than, to, untreated, effluent, discharging, leads, to, illegal, dumping, to, save, on, costs, for, instance, in, croatia, in, 2001, proper, pollution, abatement, cost, us, 70, 100, per, ton, of, raw, hides, processed, against, 43, t, for, irresponsible, behavior, in, november, 2009, one, of, uganda, s, main, leather, making, companies, was, caught, directly, dumping, waste, water, into, a, wetland, adjacent, to, lake, victoria, enzymes, like, proteases, lipases, and, amylases, have, an, important, role, in, the, soaking, dehairing, degreasing, and, bating, operations, of, leather, manufacturing, proteases, are, the, most, commonly, used, enzymes, in, leather, production, the, enzyme, must, not, damage, or, dissolve, collagen, or, keratin, but, should, hydrolyze, casein, elastin, albumin, globulin, like, proteins, and, nonstructural, proteins, that, are, not, essential, for, leather, making, this, process, is, called, bating, lipases, are, used, in, the, degreasing, operation, to, hydrolyze, fat, particles, embedded, in, the, skin, amylases, are, used, to, soften, skin, to, bring, out, the, grain, and, to, impart, strength, and, flexibility, to, the, skin, these, enzymes, are, rarely, used, the, natural, fibers, of, leather, break, down, with, the, passage, of, time, acidic, leathers, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, red, rot, which, causes, powdering, of, the, surface, and, a, change, in, consistency, damage, from, red, rot, is, aggravated, by, high, temperatures, and, relative, humidities, although, it, is, chemically, irreversible, treatments, can, add, handling, strength, and, prevent, disintegration, of, red, rotted, leather, exposure, to, long, periods, of, low, relative, humidities, below, 40, can, cause, leather, to, become, desiccated, irreversibly, changing, the, fibrous, structure, of, the, leather, chemical, damage, can, also, occur, from, exposure, to, environmental, factors, including, ultraviolet, light, ozone, acid, from, sulfurous, and, nitrous, pollutants, in, the, air, or, through, a, chemical, action, following, any, treatment, with, tallow, or, oil, compounds, both, oxidation, and, chemical, damage, occur, faster, at, higher, temperatures, there, are, few, methods, to, maintain, and, clean, leather, goods, properly, such, as, using, damp, cloth, and, avoid, using, a, wet, cloth, or, soaking, the, leather, in, water, various, treatments, are, available, such, as, conditioners, saddle, soap, is, used, for, cleaning, conditioning, and, softening, leather, leather, shoes, are, widely, conditioned, with, shoe, polish, due, to, its, high, resistance, to, abrasion, and, wind, leather, found, a, use, in, rugged, occupations, the, enduring, image, of, a, cowboy, in, leather, chaps, gave, way, to, the, leather, jacketed, and, leather, helmeted, aviator, when, motorcycles, were, invented, some, riders, took, to, wearing, heavy, leather, jackets, to, protect, from, road, rash, and, wind, blast, some, also, wear, chaps, or, full, leather, pants, to, protect, the, lower, body, leather, s, flexibility, allows, it, to, be, formed, and, shaped, into, balls, and, protective, gear, subsequently, many, sports, use, equipment, made, with, leather, such, as, baseball, gloves, and, the, ball, used, in, cricket, and, gridiron, football, leather, fetishism, is, the, name, popularly, used, to, describe, a, fetishistic, attraction, to, people, wearing, leather, or, in, certain, cases, to, the, garments, themselves, many, rock, groups, particularly, heavy, metal, and, punk, groups, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, are, well, known, for, wearing, leather, clothing, extreme, metal, bands, especially, black, metal, bands, and, goth, rock, groups, have, extensive, black, leather, clothing, leather, has, become, less, common, in, the, punk, community, over, the, last, three, decades, as, there, is, opposition, to, the, use, of, leather, from, punks, who, support, animal, rights, many, cars, and, trucks, come, with, optional, or, standard, leather, or, leather, faced, seating, in, countries, with, significant, populations, of, individuals, observing, religions, which, place, restrictions, on, material, choices, vendors, typically, clarify, the, source, of, leather, in, their, products, such, labeling, helps, facilitate, religious, observance, so, for, example, a, muslim, will, not, accidentally, purchase, pigskin, or, a, hindu, can, avoid, cattleskin, such, taboos, increase, the, demand, for, religiously, neutral, leathers, such, as, ostrich, and, deer, judaism, forbids, the, comfort, of, wearing, leather, shoes, on, yom, kippur, tisha, b, av, and, during, mourning, also, see, leather, in, judaism, teffilin, and, torah, scroll, jainism, prohibits, the, use, of, leather, since, it, is, obtained, by, killing, animals, many, forms, of, artificial, leather, have, been, developed, usually, involving, polyurethane, or, vinyl, coatings, applied, to, a, cloth, backing, many, names, and, brands, for, such, artificial, leathers, exist, including, pleather, a, portmanteau, of, plastic, leather, and, the, brand, name, naugahyde, another, alternative, is, cultured, leather, which, is, lab, grown, using, cell, culture, methods, mushroom, based, materials, and, gelatin, based, textile, made, by, upcycling, meat, industry, waste, leather, made, of, fungi, or, mushroom, based, materials, are, completely, biodegradable
