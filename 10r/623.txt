the, international, space, station, iss, is, a, large, space, station, that, was, assembled, and, is, maintained, in, low, earth, orbit, by, a, collaboration, of, five, space, agencies, and, their, contractors, nasa, united, states, roscosmos, russia, esa, europe, jaxa, japan, and, csa, canada, the, iss, is, the, largest, space, station, ever, built, its, primary, purpose, is, to, perform, microgravity, and, space, environment, experiments, operationally, the, station, is, divided, into, two, sections, the, russian, orbital, segment, ros, assembled, by, roscosmos, and, the, us, orbital, segment, usos, assembled, by, nasa, jaxa, esa, and, csa, a, striking, feature, of, the, iss, is, the, integrated, truss, structure, which, connects, the, large, solar, panels, and, radiators, to, the, pressurized, modules, the, pressurized, modules, are, specialized, for, research, habitation, storage, spacecraft, control, and, airlock, functions, visiting, spacecraft, dock, at, the, station, via, its, eight, docking, and, berthing, ports, the, iss, maintains, an, orbit, with, an, average, altitude, of, 400, kilometres, 250, mi, and, circles, the, earth, in, roughly, 93, minutes, completing, 15, 5, orbits, per, day, the, iss, programme, combines, two, prior, plans, to, construct, crewed, earth, orbiting, stations, space, station, freedom, planned, by, the, united, states, and, the, mir, 2, station, planned, by, the, soviet, union, the, first, iss, module, was, launched, in, 1998, major, modules, have, been, launched, by, proton, and, soyuz, rockets, and, by, the, space, shuttle, launch, system, the, first, long, term, residents, expedition, 1, arrived, on, 2, november, 2000, since, then, the, station, has, been, continuously, occupied, for, 23, years, and, 316, days, the, longest, continuous, human, presence, in, space, as, of, march, 2024, 279, individuals, from, 22, countries, have, visited, the, space, station, the, iss, is, expected, to, have, additional, modules, the, axiom, orbital, segment, for, example, and, will, be, in, service, until, the, end, of, 2030, after, which, it, is, planned, to, be, de, orbited, by, a, dedicated, nasa, spacecraft, as, the, space, race, drew, to, a, close, in, the, early, 1970s, the, us, and, ussr, began, to, contemplate, a, variety, of, potential, collaborations, in, outer, space, this, culminated, in, the, 1975, apollo, soyuz, test, project, the, first, docking, of, spacecraft, from, two, different, spacefaring, nations, the, astp, was, considered, a, success, and, further, joint, missions, were, also, contemplated, one, such, concept, was, international, skylab, which, proposed, launching, the, backup, skylab, b, space, station, for, a, mission, that, would, see, multiple, visits, by, both, apollo, and, soyuz, crew, vehicles, more, ambitious, was, the, skylab, salyut, space, laboratory, which, proposed, docking, the, skylab, b, to, a, soviet, salyut, space, station, falling, budgets, and, rising, cold, war, tensions, in, the, late, 1970s, saw, these, concepts, fall, by, the, wayside, along, with, another, plan, to, have, the, space, shuttle, dock, with, a, salyut, space, station, in, the, early, 1980s, nasa, planned, to, launch, a, modular, space, station, called, freedom, as, a, counterpart, to, the, salyut, and, mir, space, stations, in, 1984, the, esa, was, invited, to, participate, in, space, station, freedom, and, the, esa, approved, the, columbus, laboratory, by, 1987, the, japanese, experiment, module, jem, or, kib, was, announced, in, 1985, as, part, of, the, freedom, space, station, in, response, to, a, nasa, request, in, 1982, in, early, 1985, science, ministers, from, the, european, space, agency, esa, countries, approved, the, columbus, programme, the, most, ambitious, effort, in, space, undertaken, by, that, organization, at, the, time, the, plan, spearheaded, by, germany, and, italy, included, a, module, which, would, be, attached, to, freedom, and, with, the, capability, to, evolve, into, a, full, fledged, european, orbital, outpost, before, the, end, of, the, century, increasing, costs, threw, these, plans, into, doubt, in, the, early, 1990s, congress, was, unwilling, to, provide, enough, money, to, build, and, operate, freedom, and, demanded, nasa, increase, international, participation, to, defray, the, rising, costs, or, they, would, cancel, the, entire, project, outright, simultaneously, the, ussr, was, conducting, planning, for, the, mir, 2, space, station, and, had, begun, constructing, modules, for, the, new, station, by, the, mid, 1980s, however, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, required, these, plans, to, be, greatly, downscaled, and, soon, mir, 2, was, in, danger, of, never, being, launched, at, all, with, both, space, station, projects, in, jeopardy, american, and, russian, officials, met, and, proposed, they, be, combined, the, iss, was, originally, intended, to, be, a, laboratory, observatory, and, factory, while, providing, transportation, maintenance, and, a, low, earth, orbit, staging, base, for, possible, future, missions, to, the, moon, mars, and, asteroids, however, not, all, of, the, uses, envisioned, in, the, initial, memorandum, of, understanding, between, nasa, and, roscosmos, have, been, realised, in, the, 2010, united, states, national, space, policy, the, iss, was, given, additional, roles, of, serving, commercial, diplomatic, and, educational, purposes, the, iss, provides, a, platform, to, conduct, scientific, research, with, power, data, cooling, and, crew, available, to, support, experiments, small, uncrewed, spacecraft, can, also, provide, platforms, for, experiments, especially, those, involving, zero, gravity, and, exposure, to, space, but, space, stations, offer, a, long, term, environment, where, studies, can, be, performed, potentially, for, decades, combined, with, ready, access, by, human, researchers, the, iss, simplifies, individual, experiments, by, allowing, groups, of, experiments, to, share, the, same, launches, and, crew, time, research, is, conducted, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, including, astrobiology, astronomy, physical, sciences, materials, science, space, weather, meteorology, and, human, research, including, space, medicine, and, the, life, sciences, scientists, on, earth, have, timely, access, to, the, data, and, can, suggest, experimental, modifications, to, the, crew, if, follow, on, experiments, are, necessary, the, routinely, scheduled, launches, of, resupply, craft, allows, new, hardware, to, be, launched, with, relative, ease, crews, fly, expeditions, of, several, months, duration, providing, approximately, 160, person, hours, per, week, of, labour, with, a, crew, of, six, however, a, considerable, amount, of, crew, time, is, taken, up, by, station, maintenance, perhaps, the, most, notable, iss, experiment, is, the, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, ams, which, is, intended, to, detect, dark, matter, and, answer, other, fundamental, questions, about, our, universe, according, to, nasa, the, ams, is, as, important, as, the, hubble, space, telescope, currently, docked, on, station, it, could, not, have, been, easily, accommodated, on, a, free, flying, satellite, platform, because, of, its, power, and, bandwidth, needs, on, 3, april, 2013, scientists, reported, that, hints, of, dark, matter, may, have, been, detected, by, the, ams, according, to, the, scientists, the, first, results, from, the, space, borne, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, confirm, an, unexplained, excess, of, high, energy, positrons, in, earth, bound, cosmic, rays, the, space, environment, is, hostile, to, life, unprotected, presence, in, space, is, characterised, by, an, intense, radiation, field, consisting, primarily, of, protons, and, other, subatomic, charged, particles, from, the, solar, wind, in, addition, to, cosmic, rays, high, vacuum, extreme, temperatures, and, microgravity, some, simple, forms, of, life, called, extremophiles, as, well, as, small, invertebrates, called, tardigrades, can, survive, in, this, environment, in, an, extremely, dry, state, through, desiccation, medical, research, improves, knowledge, about, the, effects, of, long, term, space, exposure, on, the, human, body, including, muscle, atrophy, bone, loss, and, fluid, shift, these, data, will, be, used, to, determine, whether, high, duration, human, spaceflight, and, space, colonisation, are, feasible, in, 2006, data, on, bone, loss, and, muscular, atrophy, suggested, that, there, would, be, a, significant, risk, of, fractures, and, movement, problems, if, astronauts, landed, on, a, planet, after, a, lengthy, interplanetary, cruise, such, as, the, six, month, interval, required, to, travel, to, mars, medical, studies, are, conducted, aboard, the, iss, on, behalf, of, the, national, space, biomedical, research, institute, nsbri, prominent, among, these, is, the, advanced, diagnostic, ultrasound, in, microgravity, study, in, which, astronauts, perform, ultrasound, scans, under, the, guidance, of, remote, experts, the, study, considers, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, medical, conditions, in, space, usually, there, is, no, physician, on, board, the, iss, and, diagnosis, of, medical, conditions, is, a, challenge, it, is, anticipated, that, remotely, guided, ultrasound, scans, will, have, application, on, earth, in, emergency, and, rural, care, situations, where, access, to, a, trained, physician, is, difficult, in, august, 2020, scientists, reported, that, bacteria, from, earth, particularly, deinococcus, radiodurans, bacteria, which, is, highly, resistant, to, environmental, hazards, were, found, to, survive, for, three, years, in, outer, space, based, on, studies, conducted, on, the, international, space, station, these, findings, supported, the, notion, of, panspermia, the, hypothesis, that, life, exists, throughout, the, universe, distributed, in, various, ways, including, space, dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, or, contaminated, spacecraft, remote, sensing, of, the, earth, astronomy, and, deep, space, research, on, the, iss, have, significantly, increased, during, the, 2010s, after, the, completion, of, the, us, orbital, segment, in, 2011, throughout, the, more, than, 20, years, of, the, iss, program, researchers, aboard, the, iss, and, on, the, ground, have, examined, aerosols, ozone, lightning, and, oxides, in, earth, s, atmosphere, as, well, as, the, sun, cosmic, rays, cosmic, dust, antimatter, and, dark, matter, in, the, universe, examples, of, earth, viewing, remote, sensing, experiments, that, have, flown, on, the, iss, are, the, orbiting, carbon, observatory, 3, iss, rapidscat, ecostress, the, global, ecosystem, dynamics, investigation, and, the, cloud, aerosol, transport, system, iss, based, astronomy, telescopes, and, experiments, include, solar, the, neutron, star, interior, composition, explorer, the, calorimetric, electron, telescope, the, monitor, of, all, sky, x, ray, image, maxi, and, the, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, gravity, at, the, altitude, of, the, iss, is, approximately, 90, as, strong, as, at, earth, s, surface, but, objects, in, orbit, are, in, a, continuous, state, of, freefall, resulting, in, an, apparent, state, of, weightlessness, this, perceived, weightlessness, is, disturbed, by, five, effects, researchers, are, investigating, the, effect, of, the, station, s, near, weightless, environment, on, the, evolution, development, growth, and, internal, processes, of, plants, and, animals, in, response, to, some, of, the, data, nasa, wants, to, investigate, microgravity, s, effects, on, the, growth, of, three, dimensional, human, like, tissues, and, the, unusual, protein, crystals, that, can, be, formed, in, space, investigating, the, physics, of, fluids, in, microgravity, will, provide, better, models, of, the, behaviour, of, fluids, because, fluids, can, be, almost, completely, combined, in, microgravity, physicists, investigate, fluids, that, do, not, mix, well, on, earth, examining, reactions, that, are, slowed, by, low, gravity, and, low, temperatures, will, improve, our, understanding, of, superconductivity, the, study, of, materials, science, is, an, important, iss, research, activity, with, the, objective, of, reaping, economic, benefits, through, the, improvement, of, techniques, used, on, earth, other, areas, of, interest, include, the, effect, of, low, gravity, on, combustion, through, the, study, of, the, efficiency, of, burning, and, control, of, emissions, and, pollutants, these, findings, may, improve, knowledge, about, energy, production, and, lead, to, economic, and, environmental, benefits, the, iss, provides, a, location, in, the, relative, safety, of, low, earth, orbit, to, test, spacecraft, systems, that, will, be, required, for, long, duration, missions, to, the, moon, and, mars, this, provides, experience, in, operations, maintenance, and, repair, and, replacement, activities, on, orbit, this, will, help, develop, essential, skills, in, operating, spacecraft, farther, from, earth, reduce, mission, risks, and, advance, the, capabilities, of, interplanetary, spacecraft, referring, to, the, mars, 500, experiment, a, crew, isolation, experiment, conducted, on, earth, esa, states, whereas, the, iss, is, essential, for, answering, questions, concerning, the, possible, impact, of, weightlessness, radiation, and, other, space, specific, factors, aspects, such, as, the, effect, of, long, term, isolation, and, confinement, can, be, more, appropriately, addressed, via, ground, based, simulations, sergey, krasnov, the, head, of, human, space, flight, programmes, for, russia, s, space, agency, roscosmos, in, 2011, suggested, a, shorter, version, of, mars, 500, may, be, carried, out, on, the, iss, in, 2009, noting, the, value, of, the, partnership, framework, itself, sergey, krasnov, wrote, when, compared, with, partners, acting, separately, partners, developing, complementary, abilities, and, resources, could, give, us, much, more, assurance, of, the, success, and, safety, of, space, exploration, the, iss, is, helping, further, advance, near, earth, space, exploration, and, realisation, of, prospective, programmes, of, research, and, exploration, of, the, solar, system, including, the, moon, and, mars, a, crewed, mission, to, mars, may, be, a, multinational, effort, involving, space, agencies, and, countries, outside, the, current, iss, partnership, in, 2010, esa, director, general, jean, jacques, dordain, stated, his, agency, was, ready, to, propose, to, the, other, four, partners, that, china, india, and, south, korea, be, invited, to, join, the, iss, partnership, nasa, chief, charles, bolden, stated, in, february, 2011, any, mission, to, mars, is, likely, to, be, a, global, effort, currently, us, federal, legislation, prevents, nasa, co, operation, with, china, on, space, projects, without, approval, by, the, fbi, and, congress, the, iss, crew, provides, opportunities, for, students, on, earth, by, running, student, developed, experiments, making, educational, demonstrations, allowing, for, student, participation, in, classroom, versions, of, iss, experiments, and, directly, engaging, students, using, radio, and, email, esa, offers, a, wide, range, of, free, teaching, materials, that, can, be, downloaded, for, use, in, classrooms, in, one, lesson, students, can, navigate, a, 3d, model, of, the, interior, and, exterior, of, the, iss, and, face, spontaneous, challenges, to, solve, in, real, time, the, japanese, aerospace, exploration, agency, jaxa, aims, to, inspire, children, to, pursue, craftsmanship, and, to, heighten, their, awareness, of, the, importance, of, life, and, their, responsibilities, in, society, through, a, series, of, education, guides, students, develop, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, past, and, near, term, future, of, crewed, space, flight, as, well, as, that, of, earth, and, life, in, the, jaxa, seeds, in, space, experiments, the, mutation, effects, of, spaceflight, on, plant, seeds, aboard, the, iss, are, explored, by, growing, sunflower, seeds, that, have, flown, on, the, iss, for, about, nine, months, in, the, first, phase, of, kib, utilisation, from, 2008, to, mid, 2010, researchers, from, more, than, a, dozen, japanese, universities, conducted, experiments, in, diverse, fields, cultural, activities, are, another, major, objective, of, the, iss, programme, tetsuo, tanaka, the, director, of, jaxa, s, space, environment, and, utilization, center, has, said, there, is, something, about, space, that, touches, even, people, who, are, not, interested, in,

study, astronaut, scott, kelly, spent, a, year, in, space, on, the, iss, while, his, twin, spent, the, year, on, earth, several, long, lasting, changes, were, observed, including, those, related, to, alterations, in, dna, and, cognition, when, one, twin, was, compared, with, the, other, in, november, 2019, researchers, reported, that, astronauts, experienced, serious, blood, flow, and, clot, problems, while, on, board, the, iss, based, on, a, six, month, study, of, 11, healthy, astronauts, the, results, may, influence, long, term, spaceflight, including, a, mission, to, the, planet, mars, according, to, the, researchers, the, iss, is, partially, protected, from, the, space, environment, by, earth, s, magnetic, field, from, an, average, distance, of, about, 70, 000, km, 43, 000, mi, from, the, earth, s, surface, depending, on, solar, activity, the, magnetosphere, begins, to, deflect, solar, wind, around, earth, and, the, space, station, solar, flares, are, still, a, hazard, to, the, crew, who, may, receive, only, a, few, minutes, warning, in, 2005, during, the, initial, proton, storm, of, an, x, 3, class, solar, flare, the, crew, of, expedition, 10, took, shelter, in, a, more, heavily, shielded, part, of, the, ros, designed, for, this, purpose, subatomic, charged, particles, primarily, protons, from, cosmic, rays, and, solar, wind, are, normally, absorbed, by, earth, s, atmosphere, when, they, interact, in, sufficient, quantity, their, effect, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, a, phenomenon, called, an, aurora, outside, earth, s, atmosphere, iss, crews, are, exposed, to, approximately, one, millisievert, each, day, about, a, year, s, worth, of, natural, exposure, on, earth, resulting, in, a, higher, risk, of, cancer, radiation, can, penetrate, living, tissue, and, damage, the, dna, and, chromosomes, of, lymphocytes, being, central, to, the, immune, system, any, damage, to, these, cells, could, contribute, to, the, lower, immunity, experienced, by, astronauts, radiation, has, also, been, linked, to, a, higher, incidence, of, cataracts, in, astronauts, protective, shielding, and, medications, may, lower, the, risks, to, an, acceptable, level, radiation, levels, on, the, iss, are, between, 12, and, 28, 8, milli, rads, per, day, about, five, times, greater, than, those, experienced, by, airline, passengers, and, crew, as, earth, s, electromagnetic, field, provides, almost, the, same, level, of, protection, against, solar, and, other, types, of, radiation, in, low, earth, orbit, as, in, the, stratosphere, for, example, on, a, 12, hour, flight, an, airline, passenger, would, experience, 0, 1, millisieverts, of, radiation, or, a, rate, of, 0, 2, millisieverts, per, day, this, is, one, fifth, the, rate, experienced, by, an, astronaut, in, leo, additionally, airline, passengers, experience, this, level, of, radiation, for, a, few, hours, of, flight, while, the, iss, crew, are, exposed, for, their, whole, stay, on, board, the, station, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, psychosocial, stressors, are, among, the, most, important, impediments, to, optimal, crew, morale, and, performance, cosmonaut, valery, ryumin, wrote, in, his, journal, during, a, particularly, difficult, period, on, board, the, salyut, 6, space, station, all, the, conditions, necessary, for, murder, are, met, if, you, shut, two, men, in, a, cabin, measuring, 18, feet, by, 20, and, leave, them, together, for, two, months, nasa, s, interest, in, psychological, stress, caused, by, space, travel, initially, studied, when, their, crewed, missions, began, was, rekindled, when, astronauts, joined, cosmonauts, on, the, russian, space, station, mir, common, sources, of, stress, in, early, us, missions, included, maintaining, high, performance, under, public, scrutiny, and, isolation, from, peers, and, family, the, latter, is, still, often, a, cause, of, stress, on, the, iss, such, as, when, the, mother, of, nasa, astronaut, daniel, tani, died, in, a, car, accident, and, when, michael, fincke, was, forced, to, miss, the, birth, of, his, second, child, a, study, of, the, longest, spaceflight, concluded, that, the, first, three, weeks, are, a, critical, period, where, attention, is, adversely, affected, because, of, the, demand, to, adjust, to, the, extreme, change, of, environment, iss, crew, flights, typically, last, about, five, to, six, months, the, iss, working, environment, includes, further, stress, caused, by, living, and, working, in, cramped, conditions, with, people, from, very, different, cultures, who, speak, a, different, language, first, generation, space, stations, had, crews, who, spoke, a, single, language, second, and, third, generation, stations, have, crew, from, many, cultures, who, speak, many, languages, astronauts, must, speak, english, and, russian, and, knowing, additional, languages, is, even, better, due, to, the, lack, of, gravity, confusion, often, occurs, even, though, there, is, no, up, and, down, in, space, some, crew, members, feel, like, they, are, oriented, upside, down, they, may, also, have, difficulty, measuring, distances, this, can, cause, problems, like, getting, lost, inside, the, space, station, pulling, switches, in, the, wrong, direction, or, misjudging, the, speed, of, an, approaching, vehicle, during, docking, the, physiological, effects, of, long, term, weightlessness, include, muscle, atrophy, deterioration, of, the, skeleton, osteopenia, fluid, redistribution, a, slowing, of, the, cardiovascular, system, decreased, production, of, red, blood, cells, balance, disorders, and, a, weakening, of, the, immune, system, lesser, symptoms, include, loss, of, body, mass, and, puffiness, of, the, face, sleep, is, regularly, disturbed, on, the, iss, because, of, mission, demands, such, as, incoming, or, departing, spacecraft, sound, levels, in, the, station, are, unavoidably, high, the, atmosphere, is, unable, to, thermosiphon, naturally, so, fans, are, required, at, all, times, to, process, the, air, which, would, stagnate, in, the, freefall, zero, g, environment, to, prevent, some, of, the, adverse, effects, on, the, body, the, station, is, equipped, with, two, tvis, treadmills, including, the, colbert, the, ared, advanced, resistive, exercise, device, which, enables, various, weightlifting, exercises, that, add, muscle, without, raising, or, compensating, for, the, astronauts, reduced, bone, density, and, a, stationary, bicycle, each, astronaut, spends, at, least, two, hours, per, day, exercising, on, the, equipment, astronauts, use, bungee, cords, to, strap, themselves, to, the, treadmill, hazardous, molds, that, can, foul, air, and, water, filters, may, develop, aboard, space, stations, they, can, produce, acids, that, degrade, metal, glass, and, rubber, they, can, also, be, harmful, to, the, crew, s, health, microbiological, hazards, have, led, to, a, development, of, the, locad, pts, a, portable, test, system, which, identifies, common, bacteria, and, molds, faster, than, standard, methods, of, culturing, which, may, require, a, sample, to, be, sent, back, to, earth, researchers, in, 2018, reported, after, detecting, the, presence, of, five, enterobacter, bugandensis, bacterial, strains, on, the, iss, none, of, which, are, pathogenic, to, humans, that, microorganisms, on, the, iss, should, be, carefully, monitored, to, continue, assuring, a, medically, healthy, environment, for, astronauts, contamination, on, space, stations, can, be, prevented, by, reduced, humidity, and, by, using, paint, that, contains, mold, killing, chemicals, as, well, as, the, use, of, antiseptic, solutions, all, materials, used, in, the, iss, are, tested, for, resistance, against, fungi, since, 2016, a, series, of, esa, sponsored, experiments, have, been, conducted, to, test, the, anti, bacterial, properties, of, various, materials, with, the, goal, of, developing, smart, surfaces, that, mitigate, bacterial, growth, in, multiple, ways, using, the, best, method, for, a, particular, circumstance, dubbed, microbial, aerosol, tethering, on, innovative, surfaces, matiss, the, programme, involves, deployment, of, small, plaques, containing, an, array, of, glass, squares, covered, with, different, test, coatings, they, remain, on, the, station, for, six, months, before, being, returned, to, earth, for, analysis, the, most, recent, and, final, experiment, of, the, series, was, launched, on, 5, june, 2023, aboard, the, spacex, crs, 28, cargo, mission, to, iss, comprising, four, plaques, whereas, previous, experiments, in, the, series, were, limited, to, analysis, by, light, microsocopy, this, experiment, uses, quartz, glass, made, of, pure, silica, which, will, allow, spectrographic, analysis, two, of, the, plaques, were, returned, after, eight, months, and, the, remaining, two, after, 16, months, in, april, 2019, nasa, reported, that, a, comprehensive, study, had, been, conducted, into, the, microorganisms, and, fungi, present, on, the, iss, the, experiment, was, performed, over, a, period, of, 14, months, on, three, different, flight, missions, and, involved, taking, samples, from, 8, predefined, locations, inside, the, station, then, returning, them, to, earth, for, analysis, in, prior, experiments, analysis, was, limited, to, culture, based, methods, thus, overlooking, microbes, which, cannot, be, grown, in, culture, the, present, study, used, molecular, based, methods, in, addition, to, culturing, resulting, in, a, more, complete, catalog, the, results, may, be, useful, in, improving, the, health, and, safety, conditions, for, astronauts, as, well, as, better, understanding, other, closed, in, environments, on, earth, such, as, clean, rooms, used, by, the, pharmaceutical, and, medical, industries, space, flight, is, not, inherently, quiet, with, noise, levels, exceeding, acoustic, standards, as, far, back, as, the, apollo, missions, for, this, reason, nasa, and, the, international, space, station, international, partners, have, developed, noise, control, and, hearing, loss, prevention, goals, as, part, of, the, health, program, for, crew, members, specifically, these, goals, have, been, the, primary, focus, of, the, iss, multilateral, medical, operations, panel, mmop, acoustics, subgroup, since, the, first, days, of, iss, assembly, and, operations, the, effort, includes, contributions, from, acoustical, engineers, audiologists, industrial, hygienists, and, physicians, who, comprise, the, subgroup, s, membership, from, nasa, roscosmos, the, european, space, agency, esa, the, japanese, aerospace, exploration, agency, jaxa, and, the, canadian, space, agency, csa, when, compared, to, terrestrial, environments, the, noise, levels, incurred, by, astronauts, and, cosmonauts, on, the, iss, may, seem, insignificant, and, typically, occur, at, levels, that, would, not, be, of, major, concern, to, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, rarely, reaching, 85, dba, but, crew, members, are, exposed, to, these, levels, 24, hours, a, day, seven, days, a, week, with, current, missions, averaging, six, months, in, duration, these, levels, of, noise, also, impose, risks, to, crew, health, and, performance, in, the, form, of, sleep, interference, and, communication, as, well, as, reduced, alarm, audibility, over, the, 19, plus, year, history, of, the, iss, significant, efforts, have, been, put, forth, to, limit, and, reduce, noise, levels, on, the, iss, during, design, and, pre, flight, activities, members, of, the, acoustic, subgroup, have, written, acoustic, limits, and, verification, requirements, consulted, to, design, and, choose, the, quietest, available, payloads, and, then, conducted, acoustic, verification, tests, prior, to, launch, 5, 7, 3, during, spaceflights, the, acoustics, subgroup, has, assessed, each, iss, module, s, in, flight, sound, levels, produced, by, a, large, number, of, vehicle, and, science, experiment, noise, sources, to, assure, compliance, with, strict, acoustic, standards, the, acoustic, environment, on, iss, changed, when, additional, modules, were, added, during, its, construction, and, as, additional, spacecraft, arrive, at, the, iss, the, acoustics, subgroup, has, responded, to, this, dynamic, operations, schedule, by, successfully, designing, and, employing, acoustic, covers, absorptive, materials, noise, barriers, and, vibration, isolators, to, reduce, noise, levels, moreover, when, pumps, fans, and, ventilation, systems, age, and, show, increased, noise, levels, this, acoustics, subgroup, has, guided, iss, managers, to, replace, the, older, noisier, instruments, with, quiet, fan, and, pump, technologies, significantly, reducing, ambient, noise, levels, nasa, has, adopted, most, conservative, damage, risk, criteria, based, on, recommendations, from, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, and, the, world, health, organization, in, order, to, protect, all, crew, members, the, mmop, acoustics, subgroup, has, adjusted, its, approach, to, managing, noise, risks, in, this, unique, environment, by, applying, or, modifying, terrestrial, approaches, for, hearing, loss, prevention, to, set, these, conservative, limits, one, innovative, approach, has, been, nasa, s, noise, exposure, estimation, tool, neet, in, which, noise, exposures, are, calculated, in, a, task, based, approach, to, determine, the, need, for, hearing, protection, devices, hpds, guidance, for, use, of, hpds, either, mandatory, use, or, recommended, is, then, documented, in, the, noise, hazard, inventory, and, posted, for, crew, reference, during, their, missions, the, acoustics, subgroup, also, tracks, spacecraft, noise, exceedances, applies, engineering, controls, and, recommends, hearing, protective, devices, to, reduce, crew, noise, exposures, finally, hearing, thresholds, are, monitored, on, orbit, during, missions, there, have, been, no, persistent, mission, related, hearing, threshold, shifts, among, us, orbital, segment, crewmembers, jaxa, csa, esa, nasa, during, what, is, approaching, 20, years, of, iss, mission, operations, or, nearly, 175, 000, work, hours, in, 2020, the, mmop, acoustics, subgroup, received, the, safe, in, sound, award, for, innovation, for, their, combined, efforts, to, mitigate, any, health, effects, of, noise, an, onboard, fire, or, a, toxic, gas, leak, are, other, potential, hazards, ammonia, is, used, in, the, external, radiators, of, the,

approximately, two, orbits, three, hours, for, the, boost, to, a, higher, altitude, to, be, completed, maintaining, iss, altitude, uses, about, 7, 5, tonnes, of, chemical, fuel, per, annum, at, an, annual, cost, of, about, 210, million, the, russian, orbital, segment, contains, the, data, management, system, which, handles, guidance, navigation, and, control, ros, gnc, for, the, entire, station, initially, zarya, the, first, module, of, the, station, controlled, the, station, until, a, short, time, after, the, russian, service, module, zvezda, docked, and, was, transferred, control, zvezda, contains, the, esa, built, dms, r, data, management, system, using, two, fault, tolerant, computers, ftc, zvezda, computes, the, station, s, position, and, orbital, trajectory, using, redundant, earth, horizon, sensors, solar, horizon, sensors, as, well, as, sun, and, star, trackers, the, ftcs, each, contain, three, identical, processing, units, working, in, parallel, and, provide, advanced, fault, masking, by, majority, voting, zvezda, uses, gyroscopes, reaction, wheels, and, thrusters, to, turn, itself, gyroscopes, do, not, require, propellant, instead, they, use, electricity, to, store, momentum, in, flywheels, by, turning, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, station, s, movement, the, usos, has, its, own, computer, controlled, gyroscopes, to, handle, its, extra, mass, when, gyroscopes, saturate, thrusters, are, used, to, cancel, out, the, stored, momentum, in, february, 2005, during, expedition, 10, an, incorrect, command, was, sent, to, the, station, s, computer, using, about, 14, kilograms, of, propellant, before, the, fault, was, noticed, and, fixed, when, attitude, control, computers, in, the, ros, and, usos, fail, to, communicate, properly, this, can, result, in, a, rare, force, fight, where, the, ros, gnc, computer, must, ignore, the, usos, counterpart, which, itself, has, no, thrusters, docked, spacecraft, can, also, be, used, to, maintain, station, attitude, such, as, for, troubleshooting, or, during, the, installation, of, the, s3, s4, truss, which, provides, electrical, power, and, data, interfaces, for, the, station, s, electronics, the, low, altitudes, at, which, the, iss, orbits, are, also, home, to, a, variety, of, space, debris, including, spent, rocket, stages, defunct, satellites, explosion, fragments, including, materials, from, anti, satellite, weapon, tests, paint, flakes, slag, from, solid, rocket, motors, and, coolant, released, by, us, a, nuclear, powered, satellites, these, objects, in, addition, to, natural, micrometeoroids, are, a, significant, threat, objects, large, enough, to, destroy, the, station, can, be, tracked, and, therefore, are, not, as, dangerous, as, smaller, debris, objects, too, small, to, be, detected, by, optical, and, radar, instruments, from, approximately, 1, cm, down, to, microscopic, size, number, in, the, trillions, despite, their, small, size, some, of, these, objects, are, a, threat, because, of, their, kinetic, energy, and, direction, in, relation, to, the, station, spacewalking, crew, in, spacesuits, are, also, at, risk, of, suit, damage, and, consequent, exposure, to, vacuum, ballistic, panels, also, called, micrometeorite, shielding, are, incorporated, into, the, station, to, protect, pressurised, sections, and, critical, systems, the, type, and, thickness, of, these, panels, depend, on, their, predicted, exposure, to, damage, the, station, s, shields, and, structure, have, different, designs, on, the, ros, and, the, usos, on, the, usos, whipple, shields, are, used, the, us, segment, modules, consist, of, an, inner, layer, made, from, 1, 5, 5, 0, cm, thick, 0, 59, 1, 97, in, aluminium, a, 10, cm, thick, 3, 9, in, intermediate, layers, of, kevlar, and, nextel, a, ceramic, fabric, and, an, outer, layer, of, stainless, steel, which, causes, objects, to, shatter, into, a, cloud, before, hitting, the, hull, thereby, spreading, the, energy, of, impact, on, the, ros, a, carbon, fibre, reinforced, polymer, honeycomb, screen, is, spaced, from, the, hull, an, aluminium, honeycomb, screen, is, spaced, from, that, with, a, screen, vacuum, thermal, insulation, covering, and, glass, cloth, over, the, top, space, debris, is, tracked, remotely, from, the, ground, and, the, station, crew, can, be, notified, if, necessary, thrusters, on, the, russian, orbital, segment, can, alter, the, station, s, orbital, altitude, avoiding, the, debris, these, debris, avoidance, manoeuvres, dams, are, not, uncommon, taking, place, if, computational, models, show, the, debris, will, approach, within, a, certain, threat, distance, ten, dams, had, been, performed, by, the, end, of, 2009, usually, an, increase, in, orbital, velocity, of, the, order, of, 1, m, s, is, used, to, raise, the, orbit, by, one, or, two, kilometres, if, necessary, the, altitude, can, also, be, lowered, although, such, a, manoeuvre, wastes, propellant, if, a, threat, from, orbital, debris, is, identified, too, late, for, a, dam, to, be, safely, conducted, the, station, crew, close, all, the, hatches, aboard, the, station, and, retreat, into, their, spacecraft, in, order, to, be, able, to, evacuate, in, the, event, the, station, was, seriously, damaged, by, the, debris, partial, station, evacuations, have, occurred, on, 13, march, 2009, 28, june, 2011, 24, march, 2012, 16, june, 2015, november, 2021, and, 27, june, 2024, the, november, 2021, evacuation, was, caused, by, a, russian, anti, satellite, weapon, test, nasa, administrator, bill, nelson, said, it, was, unthinkable, that, russia, would, endanger, the, lives, of, everyone, on, iss, including, their, own, cosmonauts, the, iss, is, visible, in, the, sky, to, the, naked, eye, as, a, visibly, moving, bright, white, dot, when, crossing, the, sky, and, being, illuminated, by, the, sun, during, twilight, the, hours, after, sunset, and, before, sunrise, when, the, station, remains, sunlit, outside, of, earth, s, shadow, but, the, ground, and, sky, are, dark, it, crosses, the, skies, at, latitudes, between, the, polar, regions, depending, on, the, path, it, takes, across, the, sky, the, time, it, takes, the, station, to, move, across, the, horizon, or, from, one, to, the, other, may, be, short, or, up, to, 10, minutes, while, likely, being, only, visible, part, of, that, time, because, of, it, moving, into, or, out, of, earth, s, shadow, it, then, returns, around, every, 90, minutes, with, the, time, of, the, day, that, it, crosses, the, sky, shifting, over, the, course, of, some, weeks, and, therefore, before, returning, to, twilight, and, visible, illumination, because, of, the, size, of, its, reflective, surface, area, the, iss, is, the, brightest, artificial, object, in, the, sky, excluding, other, satellite, flares, with, an, approximate, maximum, magnitude, of, 4, when, in, sunlight, and, overhead, similar, to, venus, and, a, maximum, angular, size, of, 63, arcseconds, tools, are, provided, by, a, number, of, websites, such, as, heavens, above, see, live, viewing, below, as, well, as, smartphone, applications, that, use, orbital, data, and, the, observer, s, longitude, and, latitude, to, indicate, when, the, iss, will, be, visible, weather, permitting, where, the, station, will, appear, to, rise, the, altitude, above, the, horizon, it, will, reach, and, the, duration, of, the, pass, before, the, station, disappears, either, by, setting, below, the, horizon, or, entering, into, earth, s, shadow, in, november, 2012, nasa, launched, its, spot, the, station, service, which, sends, people, text, and, email, alerts, when, the, station, is, due, to, fly, above, their, town, the, station, is, visible, from, 95, of, the, inhabited, land, on, earth, but, is, not, visible, from, extreme, northern, or, southern, latitudes, under, specific, conditions, the, iss, can, be, observed, at, night, on, five, consecutive, orbits, those, conditions, are, 1, a, mid, latitude, observer, location, 2, near, the, time, of, the, solstice, with, 3, the, iss, passing, in, the, direction, of, the, pole, from, the, observer, near, midnight, local, time, the, three, photos, show, the, first, middle, and, last, of, the, five, passes, on, 5, 6, june, 2014, using, a, telescope, mounted, camera, to, photograph, the, station, is, a, popular, hobby, for, astronomers, while, using, a, mounted, camera, to, photograph, the, earth, and, stars, is, a, popular, hobby, for, crew, the, use, of, a, telescope, or, binoculars, allows, viewing, of, the, iss, during, daylight, hours, transits, of, the, iss, in, front, of, the, sun, particularly, during, an, eclipse, and, so, the, earth, sun, moon, and, iss, are, all, positioned, approximately, in, a, single, line, are, of, particular, interest, for, amateur, astronomers, involving, five, space, programs, and, fifteen, countries, the, international, space, station, is, the, most, politically, and, legally, complex, space, exploration, programme, in, history, the, 1998, space, station, intergovernmental, agreement, sets, forth, the, primary, framework, for, international, cooperation, among, the, parties, a, series, of, subsequent, agreements, govern, other, aspects, of, the, station, ranging, from, jurisdictional, issues, to, a, code, of, conduct, among, visiting, astronauts, brazil, was, also, invited, to, participate, in, the, programme, the, only, developing, country, to, receive, such, an, invitation, under, the, agreement, framework, brazil, was, to, provide, six, pieces, of, hardware, and, in, exchange, would, receive, iss, utilization, rights, however, brazil, was, unable, to, deliver, any, of, the, elements, due, to, a, lack, of, funding, and, political, priority, within, the, country, brazil, officially, dropped, out, of, the, iss, programme, in, 2007, following, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, continued, cooperation, between, russia, and, other, countries, on, the, international, space, station, has, been, put, into, question, roscosmos, director, general, dmitry, rogozin, insinuated, that, russian, withdrawal, could, cause, the, international, space, station, to, de, orbit, due, to, lack, of, reboost, capabilities, writing, in, a, series, of, tweets, if, you, block, cooperation, with, us, who, will, save, the, iss, from, an, unguided, de, orbit, to, impact, on, the, territory, of, the, us, or, europe, there, s, also, the, chance, of, impact, of, the, 500, ton, construction, in, india, or, china, do, you, want, to, threaten, them, with, such, a, prospect, the, iss, doesn, t, fly, over, russia, so, all, the, risk, is, yours, are, you, ready, for, it, this, latter, claim, is, untrue, the, iss, flies, over, all, parts, of, the, earth, between, 51, 6, degrees, latitude, north, and, south, approximately, the, latitude, of, saratov, rogozin, later, tweeted, that, normal, relations, between, iss, partners, could, only, be, restored, once, sanctions, have, been, lifted, and, indicated, that, roscosmos, would, submit, proposals, to, the, russian, government, on, ending, cooperation, nasa, stated, that, if, necessary, us, corporation, northrop, grumman, has, offered, a, reboost, capability, that, would, keep, the, iss, in, orbit, on, 26, july, 2022, yury, borisov, rogozin, s, successor, as, head, of, roscosmos, submitted, to, russian, president, putin, plans, for, withdrawal, from, the, programme, after, 2024, however, robyn, gatens, the, nasa, official, in, charge, of, the, space, station, responded, that, nasa, had, not, received, any, formal, notices, from, roscosmos, concerning, withdrawal, plans, originally, the, iss, was, planned, to, be, a, 15, year, mission, therefore, an, end, of, mission, had, been, worked, on, but, was, several, times, postponed, due, to, the, success, and, support, for, the, operation, of, the, station, as, a, result, the, oldest, modules, of, the, iss, have, been, in, orbit, for, more, than, 20, years, with, their, reliability, having, decreased, it, has, been, proposed, to, use, funds, instead, elsewhere, for, example, for, a, return, to, the, moon, according, to, the, outer, space, treaty, the, parties, are, legally, responsible, for, all, spacecraft, or, modules, they, launch, an, unmaintained, station, would, pose, an, orbital, and, re, entry, hazard, russia, has, stated, that, it, plans, to, pull, out, of, the, iss, program, after, 2025, however, russian, modules, will, provide, orbital, station, keeping, until, 2028, the, us, planned, in, 2009, to, deorbit, the, iss, in, 2016, but, on, 30, september, 2015, boeing, s, contract, with, nasa, as, prime, contractor, for, the, iss, was, extended, to, 30, september, 2020, part, of, boeing, s, services, under, the, contract, related, to, extending, the, station, s, primary, structural, hardware, past, 2020, to, the, end, of, 2028, in, july, 2018, the, space, frontier, act, of, 2018, was, intended, to, extend, operations, of, the, iss, to, 2030, this, bill, was, unanimously, approved, in, the, senate, but, failed, to, pass, in, the, u, s, house, in, september, 2018, the, leading, human, spaceflight, act, was, introduced, with, the, intent, to, extend, operations, of, the, iss, to, 2030, and, was, confirmed, in, december, 2018, congress, later, passed, similar, provisions, in, its, chips, and, science, act, signed, into, law, by, u, s, president, joe, biden, on, 9, august, 2022, if, until, 2031, commercial, leo, destinations, providers, are, not, sufficient, to, accommodate, nasa, s, projects, nasa, is, suggesting, to, extend, iss, operations, beyond, 2031, nasa, considered, originally, several, possible, disposal, options, natural, orbital, decay, with, random, reentry, as, with, skylab, boosting, the, station, to, a, higher, altitude, which, would, delay, reentry, and, a, controlled, de, orbit, targeting, a, remote, ocean, area, nasa, determined, that, random, reentry, carried, an, unacceptable, risk, of, producing, hazardous, space, debris, that, could, hit, people, or, property, and, re, boosting, the, station, would, be, costly, and, could, also, create, hazards, prior, to, 2010, plans, had, contemplated, using, a, slightly, modified, progress, spacecraft, to, de, orbit, the, iss, however, nasa, concluded, progress, would, not, be, adequate, for, the, job, and, decided, on, a, spacecraft, specifically, designed, for, the, job, in, january, 2022, nasa, announced, a, planned, date, of, january, 2031, to, de, orbit, the, iss, using, the, u, s, deorbit, vehicle, and, direct, any, remnants, into, a, remote, area, of, the, south, pacific, ocean, that, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, spacecraft, cemetery, nasa, plans, to, launch, the, deorbit, vehicle, in, 2030, docking, at, the, harmony, forward, port, the, deorbit, vehicle, will, remain, attached, dormant, for, about, a, year, as, the, station, s, orbit, naturally, decays, to, 220, km, 140, mi, the, spacecraft, would, then, conduct, one, or, more, orientation, burns, to, lower, the, perigee, to, 150, km, 93, mi, followed, by, a, final, deorbiting, burn, nasa, began, planning, for, the, deorbit, vehicle, after, becoming, wary, of, russia, pulling, out, of, the, iss, abruptly, leaving, the, other, partners, with, few, good, options, for, a, controlled, reentry, in, june, 2024, nasa, selected, spacex, to, develop, the, u, s, deorbit, vehicle, a, contract, potentially, worth, 843, million, the, vehicle, will, consist, of, an, existing, cargo, dragon, spacecraft, which, will, be, paired, with, a, significantly, lengthened, trunk, module, which, will, be, equipped, with, 46, draco, thrusters, instead, of, the, normal, 16, and, will, carry, 30, 000, kg, 66, 000, lb, of, propellant, nearly, six, times, the, normal, load, nasa, is, still, working, to, secure, all, the, necessary, funding, to, build, launch, and, operate, the, deorbit, vehicle, the, follow, up, to, nasa, s, program, strategy, is, the, commercial, leo, destinations, program, meant, to, allow, private, industry, to, build, and, maintain, their, own, stations, and, nasa, procuring, access, as, a, customer, starting, in, 2028, similarly, the, esa, has, been, seeking, new, private, space, stations, to, provide, orbital, services, as, well, as, retrieve, materials, from, the, iss, currently, axiom, station, is, being, planned, to, be, assembled, docked, to, the, iss, as, a, segment, of, the, iss, starting, sometime, after, 2024, additionally, there, even, have, been, suggestions, in, the, commercial, space, industry, that, the, iss, could, be, converted, to, commercial, operations, after, it, is, retired, by, government, entities, including, turning, it, into, a, space, hotel, russia, previously, has, planned, to, use, its, orbital, segment, for, the, construction, of, its, opsek, station, after, the, iss, is, decommissioned, the, modules, under, consideration, for, removal, from, the, current, iss, included, the, multipurpose, laboratory, module, nauka, launched, in, july, 2021, and, the, other, new, russian, modules, that, are, proposed, to, be, attached, to, nauka, these, newly, launched, modules, would, still, be, well, within, their, useful, lives, in, 2024, at, the, end, of, 2011, the, exploration, gateway, platform, concept, also, proposed, using, leftover, usos, hardware, and, zvezda, 2, as, a, refuelling, depot, and, service, station, located, at, one, of, the, earth, moon, lagrange, points, however, the, entire, usos, was, not, designed, for, disassembly, and, will, be, discarded, western, space, industry, has, suggested, in, 2022, using, the, iss, as, a, platform, to, develop, orbital, salvage, capacities, by, companies, such, as, cislunar, industries, working, on, using, space, debris, as, fuel, instead, of, plunging, it, into, the, ocean, nasa, has, stated, that, by, july, 2024, it, has, not, seen, any, viable, proposals, for, reuse, of, the, iss, or, parts, of, it, the, iss, has, been, described, as, the, most, expensive, single, item, ever, constructed, as, of, 2010, the, total, cost, was, us, 150, billion, this, includes, nasa, s, budget, of, 58, 7, billion, 89, 73, billion, in, 2021, dollars, for, the, station, from, 1985, to, 2015, russia, s, 12, billion, europe, s, 5, billion, japan, s, 5, billion, canada, s, 2, billion, and, the, cost, of, 36, shuttle, flights, to, build, the, station, estimated, at, 1, 4, billion, each, or, 50, 4, billion, in, total, assuming, 20, 000, person, days, of, use, from, 2000, to, 2015, by, two, to, six, person, crews, each, person, day, would, cost, 7, 5, million, less, than, half, the, inflation, adjusted, 19, 6, million, 5, 5, million, before, inflation, per, person, day, of, skylab, the, iss, has, become, an, international, symbol, of, human, capabilities, particularly, human, cooperation, and, science, defining, a, cooperative, international, approach, and, period, instead, of, a, looming, commercialized, and, militarized, interplanetary, world, beside, numerous, documentaries, such, as, the, imax, documentaries, space, station, 3d, from, 2002, or, a, beautiful, planet, from, 2016, and, films, like, apogee, of, fear, 2012, and, yolki, 5, 2016, the, iss, is, the, subject, of, feature, films, such, as, the, day, after,
