a, hard, disk, drive, hdd, hard, disk, hard, drive, or, fixed, disk, is, an, electro, mechanical, data, storage, device, that, stores, and, retrieves, digital, data, using, magnetic, storage, with, one, or, more, rigid, rapidly, rotating, platters, coated, with, magnetic, material, the, platters, are, paired, with, magnetic, heads, usually, arranged, on, a, moving, actuator, arm, which, read, and, write, data, to, the, platter, surfaces, data, is, accessed, in, a, random, access, manner, meaning, that, individual, blocks, of, data, can, be, stored, and, retrieved, in, any, order, hdds, are, a, type, of, non, volatile, storage, retaining, stored, data, when, powered, off, modern, hdds, are, typically, in, the, form, of, a, small, rectangular, box, hard, disk, drives, were, introduced, by, ibm, in, 1956, and, were, the, dominant, secondary, storage, device, for, general, purpose, computers, beginning, in, the, early, 1960s, hdds, maintained, this, position, into, the, modern, era, of, servers, and, personal, computers, though, personal, computing, devices, produced, in, large, volume, like, mobile, phones, and, tablets, rely, on, flash, memory, storage, devices, more, than, 224, companies, have, produced, hdds, historically, though, after, extensive, industry, consolidation, most, units, are, manufactured, by, seagate, toshiba, and, western, digital, hdds, dominate, the, volume, of, storage, produced, exabytes, per, year, for, servers, though, production, is, growing, slowly, by, exabytes, shipped, sales, revenues, and, unit, shipments, are, declining, because, solid, state, drives, ssds, have, higher, data, transfer, rates, higher, areal, storage, density, somewhat, better, reliability, and, much, lower, latency, and, access, times, the, revenues, for, ssds, most, of, which, use, nand, flash, memory, slightly, exceeded, those, for, hdds, in, 2018, flash, storage, products, had, more, than, twice, the, revenue, of, hard, disk, drives, as, of, 2017, though, ssds, have, four, to, nine, times, higher, cost, per, bit, they, are, replacing, hdds, in, applications, where, speed, power, consumption, small, size, high, capacity, and, durability, are, important, as, of, 2019, the, cost, per, bit, of, ssds, is, falling, and, the, price, premium, over, hdds, has, narrowed, the, primary, characteristics, of, an, hdd, are, its, capacity, and, performance, capacity, is, specified, in, unit, prefixes, corresponding, to, powers, of, 1000, a, 1, terabyte, tb, drive, has, a, capacity, of, 1, 000, gigabytes, where, 1, gigabyte, 1, 000, megabytes, 1, 000, 000, kilobytes, 1, million, 1, 000, 000, 000, bytes, 1, billion, typically, some, of, an, hdd, s, capacity, is, unavailable, to, the, user, because, it, is, used, by, the, file, system, and, the, computer, operating, system, and, possibly, inbuilt, redundancy, for, error, correction, and, recovery, there, can, be, confusion, regarding, storage, capacity, since, capacities, are, stated, in, decimal, gigabytes, powers, of, 1000, by, hdd, manufacturers, whereas, the, most, commonly, used, operating, systems, report, capacities, in, powers, of, 1024, which, results, in, a, smaller, number, than, advertised, performance, is, specified, as, the, time, required, to, move, the, heads, to, a, track, or, cylinder, average, access, time, the, time, it, takes, for, the, desired, sector, to, move, under, the, head, average, latency, which, is, a, function, of, the, physical, rotational, speed, in, revolutions, per, minute, and, finally, the, speed, at, which, the, data, is, transmitted, data, rate, the, two, most, common, form, factors, for, modern, hdds, are, 3, 5, inch, for, desktop, computers, and, 2, 5, inch, primarily, for, laptops, hdds, are, connected, to, systems, by, standard, interface, cables, such, as, sata, serial, ata, usb, sas, serial, attached, scsi, or, pata, parallel, ata, cables, the, first, production, ibm, hard, disk, drive, the, 350, disk, storage, shipped, in, 1957, as, a, component, of, the, ibm, 305, ramac, system, it, was, approximately, the, size, of, two, large, refrigerators, and, stored, five, million, six, bit, characters, 3, 75, megabytes, on, a, stack, of, 52, disks, 100, surfaces, used, the, 350, had, a, single, arm, with, two, read, write, heads, one, facing, up, and, the, other, down, that, moved, both, horizontally, between, a, pair, of, adjacent, platters, and, vertically, from, one, pair, of, platters, to, a, second, set, variants, of, the, ibm, 350, were, the, ibm, 355, ibm, 7300, and, ibm, 1405, in, 1961, ibm, announced, and, in, 1962, shipped, the, ibm, 1301, disk, storage, unit, which, superseded, the, ibm, 350, and, similar, drives, the, 1301, consisted, of, one, for, model, 1, or, two, for, model, 2, modules, each, containing, 25, platters, each, platter, about, 1, 8, inch, 3, 2, mm, thick, and, 24, inches, 610, mm, in, diameter, while, the, earlier, ibm, disk, drives, used, only, two, read, write, heads, per, arm, the, 1301, used, an, array, of, 48, heads, comb, each, array, moving, horizontally, as, a, single, unit, one, head, per, surface, used, cylinder, mode, read, write, operations, were, supported, and, the, heads, flew, about, 250, micro, inches, about, 6, m, above, the, platter, surface, motion, of, the, head, array, depended, upon, a, binary, adder, system, of, hydraulic, actuators, which, assured, repeatable, positioning, the, 1301, cabinet, was, about, the, size, of, three, large, refrigerators, placed, side, by, side, storing, the, equivalent, of, about, 21, million, eight, bit, bytes, per, module, access, time, was, about, a, quarter, of, a, second, also, in, 1962, ibm, introduced, the, model, 1311, disk, drive, which, was, about, the, size, of, a, washing, machine, and, stored, two, million, characters, on, a, removable, disk, pack, users, could, buy, additional, packs, and, interchange, them, as, needed, much, like, reels, of, magnetic, tape, later, models, of, removable, pack, drives, from, ibm, and, others, became, the, norm, in, most, computer, installations, and, reached, capacities, of, 300, megabytes, by, the, early, 1980s, non, removable, hdds, were, called, fixed, disk, drives, in, 1963, ibm, introduced, the, 1302, with, twice, the, track, capacity, and, twice, as, many, tracks, per, cylinder, as, the, 1301, the, 1302, had, one, for, model, 1, or, two, for, model, 2, modules, each, containing, a, separate, comb, for, the, first, 250, tracks, and, the, last, 250, tracks, some, high, performance, hdds, were, manufactured, with, one, head, per, track, e, g, burroughs, b, 475, in, 1964, ibm, 2305, in, 1970, so, that, no, time, was, lost, physically, moving, the, heads, to, a, track, and, the, only, latency, was, the, time, for, the, desired, block, of, data, to, rotate, into, position, under, the, head, known, as, fixed, head, or, head, per, track, disk, drives, they, were, very, expensive, and, are, no, longer, in, production, in, 1973, ibm, introduced, a, new, type, of, hdd, code, named, winchester, its, primary, distinguishing, feature, was, that, the, disk, heads, were, not, withdrawn, completely, from, the, stack, of, disk, platters, when, the, drive, was, powered, down, instead, the, heads, were, allowed, to, land, on, a, special, area, of, the, disk, surface, upon, spin, down, taking, off, again, when, the, disk, was, later, powered, on, this, greatly, reduced, the, cost, of, the, head, actuator, mechanism, but, precluded, removing, just, the, disks, from, the, drive, as, was, done, with, the, disk, packs, of, the, day, instead, the, first, models, of, winchester, technology, drives, featured, a, removable, disk, module, which, included, both, the, disk, pack, and, the, head, assembly, leaving, the, actuator, motor, in, the, drive, upon, removal, later, winchester, drives, abandoned, the, removable, media, concept, and, returned, to, non, removable, platters, in, 1974, ibm, introduced, the, swinging, arm, actuator, made, feasible, because, the, winchester, recording, heads, function, well, when, skewed, to, the, recorded, tracks, the, simple, design, of, the, ibm, gv, gulliver, drive, invented, at, ibm, s, uk, hursley, labs, became, ibm, s, most, licensed, electro, mechanical, invention, of, all, time, the, actuator, and, filtration, system, being, adopted, in, the, 1980s, eventually, for, all, hdds, and, still, universal, nearly, 40, years, and, 10, billion, arms, later, like, the, first, removable, pack, drive, the, first, winchester, drives, used, platters, 14, inches, 360, mm, in, diameter, in, 1978, ibm, introduced, a, swing, arm, drive, the, ibm, 0680, piccolo, with, eight, inch, platters, exploring, the, possibility, that, smaller, platters, might, offer, advantages, other, eight, inch, drives, followed, then, 5, 1, 4, in, 130, mm, drives, sized, to, replace, the, contemporary, floppy, disk, drives, the, latter, were, primarily, intended, for, the, then, fledgling, personal, computer, pc, market, over, time, as, recording, densities, were, greatly, increased, further, reductions, in, disk, diameter, to, 3, 5, and, 2, 5, were, found, to, be, optimum, powerful, rare, earth, magnet, materials, became, affordable, during, this, period, and, were, complementary, to, the, swing, arm, actuator, design, to, make, possible, the, compact, form, factors, of, modern, hdds, as, the, 1980s, began, hdds, were, a, rare, and, very, expensive, additional, feature, in, pcs, but, by, the, late, 1980s, their, cost, had, been, reduced, to, the, point, where, they, were, standard, on, all, but, the, cheapest, computers, most, hdds, in, the, early, 1980s, were, sold, to, pc, end, users, as, an, external, add, on, subsystem, the, subsystem, was, not, sold, under, the, drive, manufacturer, s, name, but, under, the, subsystem, manufacturer, s, name, such, as, corvus, systems, and, tallgrass, technologies, or, under, the, pc, system, manufacturer, s, name, such, as, the, apple, profile, the, ibm, pc, xt, in, 1983, included, an, internal, 10, mb, hdd, and, soon, thereafter, internal, hdds, proliferated, on, personal, computers, external, hdds, remained, popular, for, much, longer, on, the, apple, macintosh, many, macintosh, computers, made, between, 1986, and, 1998, featured, a, scsi, port, on, the, back, making, external, expansion, simple, older, compact, macintosh, computers, did, not, have, user, accessible, hard, drive, bays, indeed, the, macintosh, 128k, macintosh, 512k, and, macintosh, plus, did, not, feature, a, hard, drive, bay, at, all, so, on, those, models, external, scsi, disks, were, the, only, reasonable, option, for, expanding, upon, any, internal, storage, hdd, improvements, have, been, driven, by, increasing, areal, density, listed, in, the, table, above, applications, expanded, through, the, 2000s, from, the, mainframe, computers, of, the, late, 1950s, to, most, mass, storage, applications, including, computers, and, consumer, applications, such, as, storage, of, entertainment, content, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, nand, began, supplanting, hdds, in, applications, requiring, portability, or, high, performance, nand, performance, is, improving, faster, than, hdds, and, applications, for, hdds, are, eroding, in, 2018, the, largest, hard, drive, had, a, capacity, of, 15, tb, while, the, largest, capacity, ssd, had, a, capacity, of, 100, tb, as, of, 2018, hdds, were, forecast, to, reach, 100, tb, capacities, around, 2025, but, as, of, 2019, the, expected, pace, of, improvement, was, pared, back, to, 50, tb, by, 2026, smaller, form, factors, 1, 8, inches, and, below, were, discontinued, around, 2010, the, cost, of, solid, state, storage, nand, represented, by, moore, s, law, is, improving, faster, than, hdds, nand, has, a, higher, price, elasticity, of, demand, than, hdds, and, this, drives, market, growth, during, the, late, 2000s, and, 2010s, the, product, life, cycle, of, hdds, entered, a, mature, phase, and, slowing, sales, may, indicate, the, onset, of, the, declining, phase, the, 2011, thailand, floods, damaged, the, manufacturing, plants, and, impacted, hard, disk, drive, cost, adversely, between, 2011, and, 2013, in, 2019, western, digital, closed, its, last, malaysian, hdd, factory, due, to, decreasing, demand, to, focus, on, ssd, production, all, three, remaining, hdd, manufacturers, have, had, decreasing, demand, for, their, hdds, since, 2014, a, modern, hdd, records, data, by, magnetizing, a, thin, film, of, ferromagnetic, material, on, both, sides, of, a, disk, sequential, changes, in, the, direction, of, magnetization, represent, binary, data, bits, the, data, is, read, from, the, disk, by, detecting, the, transitions, in, magnetization, user, data, is, encoded, using, an, encoding, scheme, such, as, run, length, limited, encoding, which, determines, how, the, data, is, represented, by, the, magnetic, transitions, a, typical, hdd, design, consists, of, a, spindle, that, holds, flat, circular, disks, called, platters, which, hold, the, recorded, data, the, platters, are, made, from, a, non, magnetic, material, usually, aluminum, alloy, glass, or, ceramic, they, are, coated, with, a, shallow, layer, of, magnetic, material, typically, 10, 20, nm, in, depth, with, an, outer, layer, of, carbon, for, protection, for, reference, a, standard, piece, of, copy, paper, is, 0, 07, 0, 18, mm, 70, 000, 180, 000, nm, thick, the, platters, in, contemporary, hdds, are, spun, at, speeds, varying, from, 4200, rpm, in, energy, efficient, portable, devices, to, 15, 000, rpm, for, high, performance, servers, the, first, hdds, spun, at, 1, 200, rpm, and, for, many, years, 3, 600, rpm, was, the, norm, as, of, november, 2019, the, platters, in, most, consumer, grade, hdds, spin, at, 5, 400, or, 7, 200, rpm, information, is, written, to, and, read, from, a, platter, as, it, rotates, past, devices, called, read, and, write, heads, that, are, positioned, to, operate, very, close, to, the, magnetic, surface, with, their, flying, height, often, in, the, range, of, tens, of, nanometers, the, read, and, write, head, is, used, to, detect, and, modify, the, magnetization, of, the, material, passing, immediately, under, it, in, modern, drives, there, is, one, head, for, each, magnetic, platter, surface, on, the, spindle, mounted, on, a, common, arm, an, actuator, arm, or, access, arm, moves, the, heads, on, an, arc, roughly, radially, across, the, platters, as, they, spin, allowing, each, head, to, access, almost, the, entire, surface, of, the, platter, as, it, spins, the, arm, is, moved, using, a, voice, coil, actuator, or, in, some, older, designs, a, stepper, motor, early, hard, disk, drives, wrote, data, at, some, constant, bits, per, second, resulting, in, all, tracks, having, the, same, amount, of, data, per, track, but, modern, drives, since, the, 1990s, use, zone, bit, recording, increasing, the, write, speed, from, inner, to, outer, zone, and, thereby, storing, more, data, per, track, in, the, outer, zones, in, modern, drives, the, small, size, of, the, magnetic, regions, creates, the, danger, that, their, magnetic, state, might, be, lost, because, of, thermal, effects, thermally, induced, magnetic, instability, which, is, commonly, known, as, the, superparamagnetic, limit, to, counter, this, the, platters, are, coated, with, two, parallel, magnetic, layers, separated, by, a, three, atom, layer, of, the, non, magnetic, element, ruthenium, and, the, two, layers, are, magnetized, in, opposite, orientation, thus, reinforcing, each, other, another, technology, used, to, overcome, thermal, effects, to, allow, greater, recording, densities, is, perpendicular, recording, pmr, first, shipped, in, 2005, and, as, of, 2007, used, in, certain, hdds, perpendicular, recording, may, be, accompanied, by, changes, in, the, manufacturing, of, the, read, write, heads, to, increase, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, created, by, the, heads, in, 2004, a, higher, density, recording, media, was, introduced, consisting, of, coupled, soft, and, hard, magnetic, layers, so, called, exchange, spring, media, magnetic, storage, technology, also, known, as, exchange, coupled, composite, media, allows, good, writability, due, to, the, write, assist, nature, of, the, soft, layer, however, the, thermal, stability, is, determined, only, by, the, hardest, layer, and, not, influenced, by, the, soft, layer, flux, control, mamr, fc, mamr, allows, a, hard, drive, to, have, increased, recording, capacity, without, the, need, for, new, hard, disk, drive, platter, materials, mamr, hard, drives, have, a, microwave, generating, spin, torque, generator, sto, on, the, read, write, heads, which, allows, physically, smaller, bits, to, be, recorded, to, the, platters, increasing, areal, density, normally, hard, drive, recording, heads, have, a, pole, called, a, main, pole, that, is, used, for, writing, to, the, platters, and, adjacent, to, this, pole, is, an, air, gap, and, a, shield, the, write, coil, of, the, head, surrounds, the, pole, the, sto, device, is, placed, in, the, air, gap, between, the, pole, and, the, shield, to, increase, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, created, by, the, pole, fc, mamr, technically, doesn, t, use, microwaves, but, uses, technology, employed, in, mamr, the, sto, has, a, field, generation, layer, fgl, and, a, spin, injection, layer, sil, and, the, fgl, produces, a, magnetic, field, using, spin, polarised, electrons, originating, in, the, sil, which, is, a, form, of, spin, torque, energy, a, typical, hdd, has, two, electric, motors, a, spindle, motor, that, spins, the, disks, and, an, actuator, motor, that, positions, the, read, write, head, assembly, across, the, spinning, disks, the, disk, motor, has, an, external, rotor, attached, to, the, disks, the, stator, windings, are, fixed, in, place, opposite, the, actuator, at, the, end, of, the, head, support, arm, is, the, read, write, head, thin, printed, circuit, cables, connect, the, read, write, heads, to, amplifier, electronics, mounted, at, the, pivot, of, the, actuator, the, head, support, arm, is, very, light, but, also, stiff, in, modern, drives, acceleration, at, the, head, reaches, 550, g, the, actuator, is, a, permanent, magnet, and, moving, coil, motor, that, swings, the, heads, to, the, desired, position, a, metal, plate, supports, a, squat, neodymium, iron, boron, nib, high, flux, magnet, beneath, this, plate, is, the, moving, coil, often, referred, to, as, the, voice, coil, by, analogy, to, the, coil, in, loudspeakers, which, is, attached, to, the, actuator, hub, and, beneath, that, is, a, second, nib, magnet, mounted, on, the, bottom, plate, of, the, motor, some, drives, have, only, one, magnet, the, voice, coil, itself, is, shaped, rather, like, an, arrowhead, and, is, made, of, doubly, coated, copper, magnet, wire, the, inner, layer, is, insulation, and, the, outer, is, thermoplastic, which, bonds, the, coil, together, after, it, is, wound, on, a, form, making, it, self, supporting, the, portions, of, the, coil, along, the, two, sides, of, the, arrowhead, which, point, to, the, center, of, the, actuator, bearing, then, interact, with, the, magnetic, field, of, the, fixed, magnet, current, flowing, radially, outward, along, one, side, of, the, arrowhead, and, radially, inward, on, the, other, produces, the, tangential, force, if, the, magnetic, field, were, uniform, each, side, would, generate, opposing, forces, that, would, cancel, each, other, out, therefore, the, surface, of, the, magnet, is, half, north, pole, and, half, south, pole, with, the, radial, dividing, line, in, the, middle, causing, the, two, sides, of, the, coil, to, see, opposite, magnetic, fields, and, produce, forces, that, add, instead, of, canceling, currents, along, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, coil, produce, radial, forces, that, do, not, rotate, the, head, the, hdd, s, electronics, controls, the, movement, of, the, actuator, and, the, rotation, of, the, disk, and, transfers, data, to, from, a, disk, controller, feedback, of, the, drive, electronics, is, accomplished, by, means, of, special, segments, of, the, disk, dedicated, to, servo, feedback, these, are, either, complete, concentric, circles, in, the, case, of, dedicated, servo, technology, or, segments, interspersed, with, real, data, in, the, case, of, embedded, servo, otherwise, known, as, sector, servo, technology, the, servo, feedback, optimizes, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, of, the, gmr, sensors, by, adjusting, the, voice, coil, motor, to, rotate, the, arm, a, more, modern, servo, system, also, employs, milli, and, or, micro, actuators, to, more, accurately, position, the, read, write, heads, the, spinning, of, the, disks, uses, fluid, bearing, spindle, motors, modern, disk, firmware, is, capable, of, scheduling, reads, and, writes, efficiently, on, the, platter, surfaces, and, remapping, sectors, of, the, media, that, have, failed, modern, drives, make, extensive, use, of, error, correction, codes, eccs, particularly, reed, solomon, error, correction, these, techniques, store, extra, bits, determined, by, mathematical, formulas, for, each, block, of, data, the, extra, bits, allow, many, errors, to, be, corrected, invisibly, the, extra, bits, themselves, take, up, space, on, the, hdd, but, allow, higher, recording, densities, to, be, employed, without, causing, uncorrectable, errors, resulting, in, much, larger, storage, capacity, for, example, a, typical, 1, tb, hard, disk, with, 512, byte, sectors, provides, additional, capacity, of, about, 93, gb, for, the, ecc, data, in, the, newest, drives, as, of, 2009, low, density, parity, check, codes, ldpc, were, supplanting, reed, solomon, ldpc, codes, enable, performance, close, to, the, shannon, limit, and, thus, provide, the, highest, storage, density, available, typical, hard, disk, drives, attempt, to, remap, the, data, in, a, physical, sector, that, is, failing, to, a, spare, physical, sector, provided, by, the, drive, s, spare, sector, pool, also, called, reserve, pool, while, relying, on, the, ecc, to, recover, stored, data, while, the, number, of, errors, in, a, bad, sector, is, still, low, enough, the, s, m, a, r, t, self, monitoring, analysis, and, reporting, technology, feature, counts, the, total, number, of, errors, in, the, entire, hdd, fixed, by, ecc, although, not, on, all, hard, drives, as, the, related, s, m, a, r, t, attributes, hardware, ecc, recovered, and, soft, ecc, correction, are, not, consistently, supported, and, the, total, number, of, performed, sector, remappings, as, the, occurrence, of, many, such, errors, may, predict, an, hdd, failure, the, no, id, format, developed, by, ibm, in, the, mid, 1990s, contains, information, about, which, sectors, are, bad, and, where, remapped, sectors, have, been, located, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, detected, errors, end, up, as, not, correctable, examples, of, specified, uncorrected, bit, read, error, rates, include, within, a, given, manufacturers, model, the, uncorrected, bit, error, rate, is, typically, the, same, regardless, of, capacity, of, the, drive, the, worst, type, of, errors, are, silent, data, corruptions, which, are, errors, undetected, by, the, disk, firmware, or, the, host, operating, system, some, of, these, errors, may, be, caused, by, hard, disk, drive, malfunctions, while, others, originate, elsewhere, in, the, connection, between, the, drive, and, the, host, the, rate, of, areal, density, advancement, was, similar, to, moore, s, law, doubling, every, two, years, through, 2010, 60, per, year, during, 1988, 1996, 100, during, 1996, 2003, and, 30, during, 2003, 2010, speaking, in, 1997, gordon, moore, called, the, increase, flabbergasting, while, observing, later, that, growth, cannot, continue, forever, price, improvement, decelerated, to, 12, per, year, during, 2010, 2017, as, the, growth, of, areal, density, slowed, the, rate, of, advancement, for, areal, density, slowed, to, 10, per, year, during, 2010, 2016, and, there, was, difficulty, in, migrating, from, perpendicular, recording, to, newer, technologies, as, bit, cell, size, decreases, more, data, can, be, put, onto, a, single, drive, platter, in, 2013, a, production, desktop, 3, tb, hdd, with, four, platters, would, have, had, an, areal, density, of, about, 500, gbit, in, 2, which, would, have, amounted, to, a, bit, cell, comprising, about, 18, magnetic, grains, 11, by, 1, 6, grains, since, the, mid, 2000s, areal, density, progress, has, been, challenged, by, a, superparamagnetic, trilemma, involving, grain, size, grain, magnetic, strength, and, ability, of, the, head, to, write, in, order, to, maintain, acceptable, signal, to, noise, smaller, grains, are, required, smaller, grains, may, self, reverse, electrothermal, instability, unless, their, magnetic, strength, is, increased, but, known, write, head, materials, are, unable, to, generate, a, strong, enough, magnetic, field, sufficient, to, write, the, medium, in, the, increasingly, smaller, space, taken, by, grains, magnetic, storage, technologies, are, being, developed, to, address, this, trilemma, and, compete, with, flash, memory, based, solid, state, drives, ssds, in, 2013, seagate, introduced, shingled, magnetic, recording, smr, intended, as, something, of, a, stopgap, technology, between, pmr, and, seagate, s, intended, successor, heat, assisted, magnetic, recording, hamr, smr, utilises, overlapping, tracks, for, increased, data, density, at, the, cost, of, design, complexity, and, lower, data, access, speeds, particularly, write, speeds, and, random, access, 4k, speeds, by, contrast, hgst, now, part, of, western, digital, focused, on, developing, ways, to, seal, helium, filled, drives, instead, of, the, usual, filtered, air, since, turbulence, and, friction, are, reduced, higher, areal, densities, can, be, achieved, due, to, using, a, smaller, track, width, and, the, energy, dissipated, due, to, friction, is, lower, as, well, resulting, in, a, lower, power, draw, furthermore, more, platters, can, be, fit, into, the, same, enclosure, space, although, helium, gas, is, notoriously, difficult, to, prevent, escaping, thus, helium, drives, are, completely, sealed, and, do, not, have, a, breather, port, unlike, their, air, filled, counterparts, other, recording, technologies, are, either, under, research, or, have, been, commercially, implemented, to, increase, areal, density, including, seagate, s, heat, assisted, magnetic, recording, hamr, hamr, requires, a, different, architecture, with, redesigned, media, and, read, write, heads, new, lasers, and, new, near, field, optical, transducers, hamr, is, expected, to, ship, commercially, in, late, 2020, or, 2021, technical, issues, delayed, the, introduction, of, hamr, by, a, decade, from, earlier, projections, of, 2009, 2015, 2016, and, the, first, half, of, 2019, some, drives, have, adopted, dual, independent, actuator, arms, to, increase, read, write, speeds, and, compete, with, ssds, hamr, s, planned, successor, bit, patterned, recording, bpr, has, been, removed, from, the, roadmaps, of, western, digital, and, seagate, western, digital, s, microwave, assisted, magnetic, recording, mamr, also, referred, to, as, energy, assisted, magnetic, recording, eamr, was, sampled, in, 2020, with, the, first, eamr, drive, the, ultrastar, hc550, shipping, in, late, 2020, two, dimensional, magnetic, recording, tdmr, and, current, perpendicular, to, plane, giant, magnetoresistance, cpp, gmr, heads, have, appeared, in, research, papers, a, 3d, actuated, vacuum, drive, 3dhd, concept, and, 3d, magnetic, recording, have, been, proposed, depending, upon, assumptions, on, feasibility, and, timing, of, these, technologies, seagate, forecasts, that, areal, density, will, grow, 20, per, year, during, 2020, 2034, the, highest, capacity, hdds, shipping, commercially, in, 2024, are, 32, tb, the, capacity, of, a, hard, disk, drive, as, reported, by, an, operating, system, to, the, end, user, is, smaller, than, the, amount, stated, by, the, manufacturer, for, several, reasons, e, g, the, operating, system, using, some, space, use, of, some, space, for, data, redundancy, space, use, for, file, system, structures, confusion, of, decimal, prefixes, and, binary, prefixes, can, also, lead, to, errors, modern, hard, disk, drives, appear, to, their, host, controller, as, a, contiguous, set, of, logical, blocks, and, the, gross, drive, capacity, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, number, of, blocks, by, the, block, size, this, information, is, available, from, the, manufacturer, s, product, specification, and, from, the, drive, itself, through, use, of, operating, system, functions, that, invoke, low, level, drive, commands, older, ibm, and, compatible, drives, e, g, ibm, 3390, using, the, ckd, record, format, have, variable, length, records, such, drive, capacity, calculations, must, take, into, account, the, characteristics, of, the, records, some, newer, dasd, simulate, ckd, and, the, same, capacity, formulae, apply, the, gross, capacity, of, older, sector, oriented, hdds, is, calculated, as, the, product, of, the, number, of, cylinders, per, recording, zone, the, number, of, bytes, per, sector, most, commonly, 512, and, the, count, of, zones, of, the, drive, some, modern, sata, drives, also, report, cylinder, head, sector, chs, capacities, but, these, are, not, physical, parameters, because, the, reported, values, are, constrained, by, historic, operating, system, interfaces, the, c, h, s, scheme, has, been, replaced, by, logical, block, addressing, lba, a, simple, linear, addressing, scheme, that, locates, blocks, by, an, integer, index, which, starts, at, lba, 0, for, the, first, block, and, increments, thereafter, when, using, the, c, h, s, method, to, describe, modern, large, drives, the, number, of, heads, is, often, set, to, 64, although, a, typical, modern, hard, disk, drive, has, between, one, and, four, platters, in, modern, hdds, spare, capacity, for, defect, management, is, not, included, in, the, published, capacity, however, in, many, early, hdds, a, certain, number, of, sectors, were, reserved, as, spares, thereby, reducing, the, capacity, available, to, the, operating, system, furthermore, many, hdds, store, their, firmware, in, a, reserved, service, zone, which, is, typically, not, accessible, by, the, user, and, is, not, included, in, the, capacity, calculation, for, raid, subsystems, data, integrity, and, fault, tolerance, requirements, also, reduce, the, realized, capacity, for, example, a, raid, 1, array, has, about, half, the, total, capacity, as, a, result, of, data, mirroring, while, a, raid, 5, array, with, n, drives, loses, 1, n, of, capacity, which, equals, to, the, capacity, of, a, single, drive, due, to, storing, parity, information, raid, subsystems, are, multiple, drives, that, appear, to, be, one, drive, or, more, drives, to, the, user, but, provide, fault, tolerance, most, raid, vendors, use, checksums, to, improve, data, integrity, at, the, block, level, some, vendors, design, systems, using, hdds, with, sectors, of, 520, bytes, to, contain, 512, bytes, of, user, data, and, eight, checksum, bytes, or, by, using, separate, 512, byte, sectors, for, the, checksum, data, some, systems, may, use, hidden, partitions, for, system, recovery, reducing, the, capacity, available, to, the, end, user, without, knowledge, of, special, disk, partitioning, utilities, like, diskpart, in, windows, data, is, stored, on, a, hard, drive, in, a, series, of, logical, blocks, each, block, is, delimited, by, markers, identifying, its, start, and, end, error, detecting, and, correcting, information, and, space, between, blocks, to, allow, for, minor, timing, variations, these, blocks, often, contained, 512, bytes, of, usable, data, but, other, sizes, have, been, used, as, drive, density, increased, an, initiative, known, as, advanced, format, extended, the, block, size, to, 4096, bytes, of, usable, data, with, a, resulting, significant, reduction, in, the, amount, of, disk, space, used, for, block, headers, error, checking, data, and, spacing, the, process, of, initializing, these, logical, blocks, on, the, physical, disk, platters, is, called, low, level, formatting, which, is, usually, performed, at, the, factory, and, is, not, normally, changed, in, the, field, high, level, formatting, writes, data, structures, used, by, the, operating, system, to, organize, data, files, on, the, disk, this, includes, writing, partition, and, file, system, structures, into, selected, logical, blocks, for, example, some, of, the, disk, space, will, be, used, to, hold, a, directory, of, disk, file, names, and, a, list, of, logical, blocks, associated, with, a, particular, file, examples, of, partition, mapping, scheme, include, master, boot, record, mbr, and, guid, partition, table, gpt, examples, of, data, structures, stored, on, disk, to, retrieve, files, include, the, file, allocation, table, fat, in, the, dos, file, system, and, inodes, in, many, unix, file, systems, as, well, as, other, operating, system, data, structures, also, known, as, metadata, as, a, consequence, not, all, the, space, on, an, hdd, is, available, for, user, files, but, this, system, overhead, is, usually, small, compared, with, user, data, in, the, early, days, of, computing, the, total, capacity, of, hdds, was, specified, in, seven, to, nine, decimal, digits, frequently, truncated, with, the, idiom, millions, by, the, 1970s, the, total, capacity, of, hdds, was, given, by, manufacturers, using, si, decimal, prefixes, such, as, megabytes, 1, mb, 1, 000, 000, bytes, gigabytes, 1, gb, 1, 000, 000, 000, bytes, and, terabytes, 1, tb, 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, bytes, however, capacities, of, memory, are, usually, quoted, using, a, binary, interpretation, of, the, prefixes, i, e, using, powers, of, 1024, instead, of, 1000, software, reports, hard, disk, drive, or, memory, capacity, in, different, forms, using, either, decimal, or, binary, prefixes, the, microsoft, windows, family, of, operating, systems, uses, the, binary, convention, when, reporting, storage, capacity, so, an, hdd, offered, by, its, manufacturer, as, a, 1, tb, drive, is, reported, by, these, operating, systems, as, a, 931, gb, hdd, mac, os, x, 10, 6, snow, leopard, uses, decimal, convention, when, reporting, hdd, capacity, the, default, behavior, of, the, df, command, line, utility, on, linux, is, to, report, the, hdd, capacity, as, a, number, of, 1024, byte, units, the, difference, between, the, decimal, and, binary, prefix, interpretation, caused, some, consumer, confusion, and, led, to, class, action, suits, against, hdd, manufacturers, the, plaintiffs, argued, that, the, use, of, decimal, prefixes, effectively, misled, consumers, while, the, defendants, denied, any, wrongdoing, or, liability, asserting, that, their, marketing, and, advertising, complied, in, all, respects, with, the, law, and, that, no, class, member, sustained, any, damages, or, injuries, in, 2020, a, california, court, ruled, that, use, of, the, decimal, prefixes, with, a, decimal, meaning, was, not, misleading, ibm, s, first, hard, disk, drive, the, ibm, 350, used, a, stack, of, fifty, 24, inch, platters, stored, 3, 75, mb, of, data, approximately, the, size, of, one, modern, digital, picture, and, was, of, a, size, comparable, to, two, large, refrigerators, in, 1962, ibm, introduced, its, model, 1311, disk, which, used, six, 14, inch, nominal, size, platters, in, a, removable, pack, and, was, roughly, the, size, of, a, washing, machine, this, became, a, standard, platter, size, for, many, years, used, also, by, other, manufacturers, the, ibm, 2314, used, platters, of, the, same, size, in, an, eleven, high, pack, and, introduced, the, drive, in, a, drawer, layout, sometimes, called, the, pizza, oven, although, the, drawer, was, not, the, complete, drive, into, the, 1970s, hdds, were, offered, in, standalone, cabinets, of, varying, dimensions, containing, from, one, to, four, hdds, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, drives, were, offered, that, fit, entirely, into, a, chassis, that, would, mount, in, a, 19, inch, rack, digital, s, rk05, and, rl01, were, early, examples, using, single, 14, inch, platters, in, removable, packs, the, entire, drive, fitting, in, a, 10, 5, inch, high, rack, space, six, rack, units, in, the, mid, to, late, 1980s, the, similarly, sized, fujitsu, eagle, which, used, coincidentally, 10, 5, inch, platters, was, a, popular, product, with, increasing, sales, of, microcomputers, having, built, in, floppy, disk, drives, fdds, hdds, that, would, fit, to, the, fdd, mountings, became, desirable, starting, with, the, shugart, associates, sa1000, hdd, form, factors, initially, followed, those, of, 8, inch, 5, inch, and, 3, inch, floppy, disk, drives, although, referred, to, by, these, nominal, sizes, the, actual, sizes, for, those, three, drives, respectively, are, 9, 5, 5, 75, and, 4, wide, because, there, were, no, smaller, floppy, disk, drives, smaller, hdd, form, factors, such, as, 2, inch, drives, actually, 2, 75, wide, developed, from, product, offerings, or, industry, standards, as, of, 2019, 2, inch, and, 3, inch, hard, disks, are, the, most, popular, sizes, by, 2009, all, manufacturers, had, discontinued, the, development, of, new, products, for, the, 1, 3, inch, 1, inch, and, 0, 85, inch, form, factors, due, to, falling, prices, of, flash, memory, which, has, no, moving, parts, while, nominal, sizes, are, in, inches, actual, dimensions, are, specified, in, millimeters, the, factors, that, limit, the, time, to, access, the, data, on, an, hdd, are, mostly, related, to, the, mechanical, nature, of, the, rotating, disks, and, moving, heads, including, delay, may, also, occur, if, the, drive, disks, are, stopped, to, save, energy, defragmentation, is, a, procedure, used, to, minimize, delay, in, retrieving, data, by, moving, related, items, to, physically, proximate, areas, on, the, disk, some, computer, operating, systems, perform, defragmentation, automatically, although, automatic, defragmentation, is, intended, to, reduce, access, delays, performance, will, be, temporarily, reduced, while, the, procedure, is, in, progress, time, to, access, data, can, be, improved, by, increasing, rotational, speed, thus, reducing, latency, or, by, reducing, the, time, spent, seeking, increasing, areal, density, increases, throughput, by, increasing, data, rate, and, by, increasing, the, amount, of, data, under, a, set, of, heads, thereby, potentially, reducing, seek, activity, for, a, given, amount, of, data, the, time, to, access, data, has, not, kept, up, with, throughput, increases, which, themselves, have, not, kept, up, with, growth, in, bit, density, and, storage, capacity, as, of, 2010, a, typical, 7, 200, rpm, desktop, hdd, has, a, sustained, disk, to, buffer, data, transfer, rate, up, to, 1, 030, mbit, s, this, rate, depends, on, the, track, location, the, rate, is, higher, for, data, on, the, outer, tracks, where, there, are, more, data, sectors, per, rotation, and, lower, toward, the, inner, tracks, where, there, are, fewer, data, sectors, per, rotation, and, is, generally, somewhat, higher, for, 10, 000, rpm, drives, a, current, widely, used, standard, for, the, buffer, to, computer, interface, is, 3, 0, gbit, s, sata, which, can, send, about, 300, megabyte, s, 10, bit, encoding, from, the, buffer, to, the, computer, and, thus, is, still, comfortably, ahead, of, today, s, disk, to, buffer, transfer, rates, data, transfer, rate, read, write, can, be, measured, by, writing, a, large, file, to, disk, using, special, file, generator, tools, then, reading, back, the, file, transfer, rate, can, be, influenced, by, file, system, fragmentation, and, the, layout, of, the, files, hdd, data, transfer, rate, depends, upon, the, rotational, speed, of, the, platters, and, the, data, recording, density, because, heat, and, vibration, limit, rotational, speed, advancing, density, becomes, the, main, method, to, improve, sequential, transfer, rates, higher, speeds, require, a, more, powerful, spindle, motor, which, creates, more, heat, while, areal, density, advances, by, increasing, both, the, number, of, tracks, across, the, disk, and, the, number, of, sectors, per, track, only, the, latter, increases, the, data, transfer, rate, for, a, given, rpm, since, data, transfer, rate, performance, tracks, only, one, of, the, two, components, of, areal, density, its, performance, improves, at, a, lower, rate, other, performance, considerations, include, quality, adjusted, price, power, consumption, audible, noise, and, both, operating, and, non, operating, shock, resistance, current, hard, drives, connect, to, a, computer, over, one, of, several, bus, types, including, parallel, ata, serial, ata, scsi, serial, attached, scsi, sas, and, fibre, channel, some, drives, especially, external, portable, drives, use, ieee, 1394, or, usb, all, of, these, interfaces, are, digital, electronics, on, the, drive, process, the, analog, signals, from, the, read, write, heads, current, drives, present, a, consistent, interface, to, the, rest, of, the, computer, independent, of, the, data, encoding, scheme, used, internally, and, independent, of, the, physical, number, of, disks, and, heads, within, the, drive, typically, a, dsp, in, the, electronics, inside, the, drive, takes, the, raw, analog, voltages, from, the, read, head, and, uses, prml, and, reed, solomon, error, correction, to, decode, the, data, then, sends, that, data, out, the, standard, interface, that, dsp, also, watches, the, error, rate, detected, by, error, detection, and, correction, and, performs, bad, sector, remapping, data, collection, for, self, monitoring, analysis, and, reporting, technology, and, other, internal, tasks, modern, interfaces, connect, the, drive, to, the, host, interface, with, a, single, data, control, cable, each, drive, also, has, an, additional, power, cable, usually, direct, to, the, power, supply, unit, older, interfaces, had, separate, cables, for, data, signals, and, for, drive, control, signals, due, to, the, extremely, close, spacing, between, the, heads, and, the, disk, surface, hdds, are, vulnerable, to, being, damaged, by, a, head, crash, a, failure, of, the, disk, in, which, the, head, scrapes, across, the, platter, surface, often, grinding, away, the, thin, magnetic, film, and, causing, data, loss, head, crashes, can, be, caused, by, electronic, failure, a, sudden, power, failure, physical, shock, contamination, of, the, drive, s, internal, enclosure, wear, and, tear, corrosion, or, poorly, manufactured, platters, and, heads, the, hdd, s, spindle, system, relies, on, air, density, inside, the, disk, enclosure, to, support, the, heads, at, their, proper, flying, height, while, the, disk, rotates, hdds, require, a, certain, range, of, air, densities, to, operate, properly, the, connection, to, the, external, environment, and, density, occurs, through, a, small, hole, in, the, enclosure, about, 0, 5, mm, in, breadth, usually, with, a, filter, on, the, inside, the, breather, filter, if, the, air, density, is, too, low, then, there, is, not, enough, lift, for, the, flying, head, so, the, head, gets, too, close, to, the, disk, and, there, is, a, risk, of, head, crashes, and, data, loss, specially, manufactured, sealed, and, pressurized, disks, are, needed, for, reliable, high, altitude, operation, above, about, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, modern, disks, include, temperature, sensors, and, adjust, their, operation, to, the, operating, environment, breather, holes, can, be, seen, on, all, disk, drives, they, usually, have, a, sticker, next, to, them, warning, the, user, not, to, cover, the, holes, the, air, inside, the, operating, drive, is, constantly, moving, too, being, swept, in, motion, by, friction, with, the, spinning, platters, this, air, passes, through, an, internal, recirculation, or, recirc, filter, to, remove, any, leftover, contaminants, from, manufacture, any, particles, or, chemicals, that, may, have, somehow, entered, the, enclosure, and, any, particles, or, outgassing, generated, internally, in, normal, operation, very, high, humidity, present, for, extended, periods, of, time, can, corrode, the, heads, and, platters, an, exception, to, this, are, hermetically, sealed, helium, filled, hdds, that, largely, eliminate, environmental, issues, that, can, arise, due, to, humidity, or, atmospheric, pressure, changes, such, hdds, were, introduced, by, hgst, in, their, first, successful, high, volume, implementation, in, 2013, for, giant, magnetoresistive, gmr, heads, in, particular, a, minor, head, crash, from, contamination, that, does, not, remove, the, magnetic, surface, of, the, disk, still, results, in, the, head, temporarily, overheating, due, to, friction, with, the, disk, surface, and, can, render, the, data, unreadable, for, a, short, period, until, the, head, temperature, stabilizes, so, called, thermal, asperity, a, problem, which, can, partially, be, dealt, with, by, proper, electronic, filtering, of, the, read, signal, when, the, logic, board, of, a, hard, disk, fails, the, drive, can, often, be, restored, to, functioning, order, and, the, data, recovered, by, replacing, the, circuit, board, with, one, of, an, identical, hard, disk, in, the, case, of, read, write, head, faults, they, can, be, replaced, using, specialized, tools, in, a, dust, free, environment, if, the, disk, platters, are, undamaged, they, can, be, transferred, into, an, identical, enclosure, and, the, data, can, be, copied, or, cloned, onto, a, new, drive, in, the, event, of, disk, platter, failures, disassembly, and, imaging, of, the, disk, platters, may, be, required, for, logical, damage, to, file, systems, a, variety, of, tools, including, fsck, on, unix, like, systems, and, chkdsk, on, windows, can, be, used, for, data, recovery, recovery, from, logical, damage, can, require, file, carving, a, common, expectation, is, that, hard, disk, drives, designed, and, marketed, for, server, use, will, fail, less, frequently, than, consumer, grade, drives, usually, used, in, desktop, computers, however, two, independent, studies, by, carnegie, mellon, university, and, google, found, that, the, grade, of, a, drive, does, not, relate, to, the, drive, s, failure, rate, a, 2011, summary, of, research, into, ssd, and, magnetic, disk, failure, patterns, by, tom, s, hardware, summarized, research, findings, as, follows, as, of, 2019, backblaze, a, storage, provider, reported, an, annualized, failure, rate, of, two, percent, per, year, for, a, storage, farm, with, 110, 000, off, the, shelf, hdds, with, the, reliability, varying, widely, between, models, and, manufacturers, backblaze, subsequently, reported, that, the, failure, rate, for, hdds, and, ssd, of, equivalent, age, was, similar, to, minimize, cost, and, overcome, failures, of, individual, hdds, storage, systems, providers, rely, on, redundant, hdd, arrays, hdds, that, fail, are, replaced, on, an, ongoing, basis, these, drives, typically, spin, at, 5400, rpm, and, include, hdd, price, per, byte, decreased, at, the, rate, of, 40, per, year, during, 1988, 1996, 51, per, year, during, 1996, 2003, and, 34, per, year, during, 2003, 2010, the, price, decrease, slowed, down, to, 13, per, year, during, 2011, 2014, as, areal, density, increase, slowed, and, the, 2011, thailand, floods, damaged, manufacturing, facilities, and, have, held, at, 11, per, year, during, 2010, 2017, the, federal, reserve, board, has, published, a, quality, adjusted, price, index, for, large, scale, enterprise, storage, systems, including, three, or, more, enterprise, hdds, and, associated, controllers, racks, and, cables, prices, for, these, large, scale, storage, systems, decreased, at, the, rate, of, 30, per, year, during, 2004, 2009, and, 22, per, year, during, 2009, 2014, more, than, 200, companies, have, manufactured, hdds, over, time, but, consolidations, have, concentrated, production, to, just, three, manufacturers, today, western, digital, seagate, and, toshiba, production, is, mainly, in, the, pacific, rim, hdd, unit, shipments, peaked, at, 651, million, units, in, 2010, and, have, been, declining, since, then, to, 166, million, units, in, 2022, seagate, at, 43, of, units, had, the, largest, market, share, hdds, are, being, superseded, by, solid, state, drives, ssds, in, markets, where, the, higher, speed, up, to, 7, gigabytes, per, second, for, m, 2, ngff, nvme, drives, and, 2, 5, gigabytes, per, second, for, pcie, expansion, card, drives, ruggedness, and, lower, power, of, ssds, are, more, important, than, price, since, the, bit, cost, of, ssds, is, four, to, nine, times, higher, than, hdds, as, of, 2016, hdds, are, reported, to, have, a, failure, rate, of, 2, 9, per, year, while, ssds, have, fewer, failures, 1, 3, per, year, however, ssds, have, more, un, correctable, data, errors, than, hdds, ssds, offer, larger, capacities, up, to, 100, tb, than, the, largest, hdd, and, or, higher, storage, densities, 100, tb, and, 30, tb, ssds, are, housed, in, 2, 5, inch, hdd, cases, but, with, the, same, height, as, a, 3, 5, inch, hdd, although, their, cost, remains, prohibitive, a, laboratory, demonstration, of, a, 1, 33, tb, 3d, nand, chip, with, 96, layers, nand, commonly, used, in, solid, state, drives, ssds, had, 5, 5, tbit, in, 2, as, of, 2019, while, the, maximum, areal, density, for, hdds, is, 1, 5, tbit, in, 2, the, areal, density, of, flash, memory, is, doubling, every, two, years, similar, to, moore, s, law, 40, per, year, and, faster, than, the, 10, 20, per, year, for, hdds, as, of, 2018, the, maximum, capacity, was, 16, terabytes, for, an, hdd, and, 100, terabytes, for, an, ssd, hdds, were, used, in, 70, of, the, desktop, and, notebook, computers, produced, in, 2016, and, ssds, were, used, in, 30, the, usage, share, of, hdds, is, declining, and, could, drop, below, 50, in, 2018, 2019, according, to, one, forecast, because, ssds, are, replacing, smaller, capacity, less, than, one, terabyte, hdds, in, desktop, and, notebook, computers, and, mp3, players, the, market, for, silicon, based, flash, memory, nand, chips, used, in, ssds, and, other, applications, is, growing, faster, than, for, hdds, worldwide, nand, revenue, grew, 16, per, year, from, 22, billion, to, 57, billion, during, 2011, 2017, while, production, grew, 45, per, year, from, 19, exabytes, to, 175, exabytes
