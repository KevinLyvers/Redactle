military, technology, is, the, application, of, technology, for, use, in, warfare, it, comprises, the, kinds, of, technology, that, are, distinctly, military, in, nature, and, not, civilian, in, application, usually, because, they, lack, useful, or, legal, civilian, applications, or, are, dangerous, to, use, without, appropriate, military, training, the, line, is, porous, military, inventions, have, been, brought, into, civilian, use, throughout, history, with, sometimes, minor, modification, if, any, and, civilian, innovations, have, similarly, been, put, to, military, use, military, technology, is, usually, researched, and, developed, by, scientists, and, engineers, specifically, for, use, in, battle, by, the, armed, forces, many, new, technologies, came, as, a, result, of, the, military, funding, of, science, on, the, other, hand, the, theories, strategies, concepts, and, doctrines, of, warfare, are, studied, under, the, academic, discipline, of, military, science, armament, engineering, is, the, design, development, testing, and, lifecycle, management, of, military, weapons, and, systems, it, draws, on, the, knowledge, of, several, traditional, engineering, disciplines, including, mechanical, engineering, electrical, engineering, mechatronics, electro, optics, aerospace, engineering, materials, engineering, and, chemical, engineering, this, section, is, divided, into, the, broad, cultural, developments, that, affected, military, technology, the, first, use, of, stone, tools, may, have, begun, during, the, paleolithic, period, the, earliest, stone, tools, are, from, the, site, of, lomekwi, turkana, dating, from, 3, 3, million, years, ago, stone, tools, diversified, through, the, pleistocene, period, which, ended, 12, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, evidence, of, warfare, between, two, groups, is, recorded, at, the, site, of, nataruk, in, turkana, kenya, where, human, skeletons, with, major, traumatic, injuries, to, the, head, neck, ribs, knees, and, hands, including, an, embedded, obsidian, bladelet, on, a, skull, are, evidence, of, inter, group, conflict, between, groups, of, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, 10, 000, years, ago, humans, entered, the, bronze, age, as, they, learned, to, smelt, copper, into, an, alloy, with, tin, to, make, weapons, in, asia, where, copper, tin, ores, are, rare, this, development, was, delayed, until, trading, in, bronze, began, in, the, third, millennium, bce, in, the, middle, east, and, southern, european, regions, the, bronze, age, follows, the, neolithic, period, but, in, other, parts, of, the, world, the, copper, age, is, a, transition, from, neolithic, to, the, bronze, age, although, the, iron, age, generally, follows, the, bronze, age, in, some, areas, the, iron, age, intrudes, directly, on, the, neolithic, from, outside, the, region, with, the, exception, of, sub, saharan, africa, where, it, was, developed, independently, the, first, large, scale, use, of, iron, weapons, began, in, asia, minor, around, the, 14th, century, bce, and, in, central, europe, around, the, 11th, century, bce, followed, by, the, middle, east, about, 1000, bce, and, india, and, china, the, assyrians, are, credited, with, the, introduction, of, horse, cavalry, in, warfare, and, the, extensive, use, of, iron, weapons, by, 1100, bce, assyrians, were, also, the, first, to, use, iron, tipped, arrows, the, wujing, zongyao, essentials, of, the, military, arts, written, by, zeng, gongliang, ding, du, and, others, at, the, order, of, emperor, renzong, around, 1043, during, the, song, dynasty, illustrate, the, eras, focus, on, advancing, intellectual, issues, and, military, technology, due, to, the, significance, of, warfare, between, the, song, and, the, liao, jin, and, yuan, to, their, north, the, book, covers, topics, of, military, strategy, training, and, the, production, and, employment, of, advanced, weaponry, advances, in, military, technology, aided, the, song, dynasty, in, its, defense, against, hostile, neighbors, to, the, north, the, flamethrower, found, its, origins, in, byzantine, era, greece, employing, greek, fire, a, chemically, complex, highly, flammable, petrol, fluid, in, a, device, with, a, siphon, hose, by, the, 7th, century, 77, the, earliest, reference, to, greek, fire, in, china, was, made, in, 917, written, by, wu, renchen, in, his, spring, and, autumn, annals, of, the, ten, kingdoms, 80, in, 919, the, siphon, projector, pump, was, used, to, spread, the, fierce, fire, oil, that, could, not, be, doused, with, water, as, recorded, by, lin, yu, in, his, wuyue, beishi, hence, the, first, credible, chinese, reference, to, the, flamethrower, employing, the, chemical, solution, of, greek, fire, see, also, pen, huo, qi, 81, lin, yu, mentioned, also, that, the, fierce, fire, oil, derived, ultimately, from, one, of, china, s, maritime, contacts, in, the, southern, seas, arabia, dashiguo, 82, in, the, battle, of, langshan, jiang, in, 919, the, naval, fleet, of, the, wenmu, king, from, wuyue, defeated, a, huainan, army, from, the, wu, state, wenmu, s, success, was, facilitated, by, the, use, of, fire, oil, huoyou, to, burn, their, fleet, signifying, the, first, chinese, use, of, gunpowder, in, a, battle, 81, 83, the, chinese, applied, the, use, of, double, piston, bellows, to, pump, petrol, out, of, a, single, cylinder, with, an, upstroke, and, downstroke, lit, at, the, end, by, a, slow, burning, gunpowder, match, to, fire, a, continuous, stream, of, flame, 82, this, device, was, featured, in, description, and, illustration, of, the, wujing, zongyao, military, manuscript, of, 1044, 82, in, the, suppression, of, the, southern, tang, state, by, 976, early, song, naval, forces, confronted, them, on, the, yangtze, river, in, 975, southern, tang, forces, attempted, to, use, flamethrowers, against, the, song, navy, but, were, accidentally, consumed, by, their, own, fire, when, violent, winds, swept, in, their, direction, 89, although, the, destructive, effects, of, gunpowder, were, described, in, the, earlier, tang, dynasty, by, a, daoist, alchemist, the, earliest, developments, of, the, gun, barrel, and, the, projectile, fire, cannon, were, found, in, late, song, china, the, first, art, depiction, of, the, chinese, fire, lance, a, combination, of, a, temporary, fire, flamethrower, and, gun, was, from, a, buddhist, mural, painting, of, dunhuang, dated, circa, 950, these, fire, lances, were, widespread, in, use, by, the, early, 12th, century, featuring, hollowed, bamboo, poles, as, tubes, to, fire, sand, particles, to, blind, and, choke, lead, pellets, bits, of, sharp, metal, and, pottery, shards, and, finally, large, gunpowder, propelled, arrows, and, rocket, weaponry, 220, 221, eventually, perishable, bamboo, was, replaced, with, hollow, tubes, of, cast, iron, and, so, too, did, the, terminology, of, this, new, weapon, change, from, fire, spear, huo, qiang, to, fire, tube, huo, tong, 221, this, ancestor, to, the, gun, was, complemented, by, the, ancestor, to, the, cannon, what, the, chinese, referred, to, since, the, 13th, century, as, the, multiple, bullets, magazine, erupter, bai, zu, lian, zhu, pao, a, tube, of, bronze, or, cast, iron, that, was, filled, with, about, 100, lead, balls, 263, 264, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, a, gun, is, a, sculpture, from, a, cave, in, sichuan, dating, to, 1128, that, portrays, a, figure, carrying, a, vase, shaped, bombard, firing, flames, and, a, cannonball, however, the, oldest, existent, archaeological, discovery, of, a, metal, barrel, handgun, is, from, the, chinese, heilongjiang, excavation, dated, to, 1288, 293, the, chinese, also, discovered, the, explosive, potential, of, packing, hollowed, cannonball, shells, with, gunpowder, written, later, by, jiao, yu, in, his, huolongjing, mid, 14th, century, this, manuscript, recorded, an, earlier, song, era, cast, iron, cannon, known, as, the, flying, cloud, thunderclap, eruptor, fei, yun, pi, li, pao, the, manuscript, stated, that, as, noted, before, the, change, in, terminology, for, these, new, weapons, during, the, song, period, were, gradual, the, early, song, cannons, were, at, first, termed, the, same, way, as, the, chinese, trebuchet, catapult, a, later, ming, dynasty, scholar, known, as, mao, yuanyi, would, explain, this, use, of, terminology, and, true, origins, of, the, cannon, in, his, text, of, the, wubei, zhi, written, in, 1628, the, 14th, century, huolongjing, was, also, one, of, the, first, chinese, texts, to, carefully, describe, to, the, use, of, explosive, land, mines, which, had, been, used, by, the, late, song, chinese, against, the, mongols, in, 1277, and, employed, by, the, yuan, dynasty, afterwards, the, innovation, of, the, detonated, land, mine, was, accredited, to, one, luo, qianxia, in, the, campaign, of, defense, against, the, mongol, invasion, by, kublai, khan, 192, later, chinese, texts, revealed, that, the, chinese, land, mine, employed, either, a, rip, cord, or, a, motion, booby, trap, of, a, pin, releasing, falling, weights, that, rotated, a, steel, flint, wheel, which, in, turn, created, sparks, that, ignited, the, train, of, fuses, for, the, land, mines, 199, furthermore, the, song, employed, the, earliest, known, gunpowder, propelled, rockets, in, warfare, during, the, late, 13th, century, 477, its, earliest, form, being, the, archaic, fire, arrow, when, the, northern, song, capital, of, kaifeng, fell, to, the, jurchens, in, 1126, it, was, written, by, xia, shaozeng, that, 20, 000, fire, arrows, were, handed, over, to, the, jurchens, in, their, conquest, an, even, earlier, chinese, text, of, the, wujing, zongyao, collection, of, the, most, important, military, techniques, written, in, 1044, by, the, song, scholars, zeng, kongliang, and, yang, weide, described, the, use, of, three, spring, or, triple, bow, arcuballista, that, fired, arrow, bolts, holding, gunpowder, packets, near, the, head, of, the, arrow, 154, going, back, yet, even, farther, the, wu, li, xiao, shi, 1630, second, edition, 1664, of, fang, yizhi, stated, that, fire, arrows, were, presented, to, emperor, taizu, of, song, r, 960, 976, in, 960, the, islamic, gunpowder, empires, introduced, numerous, developed, firearms, cannon, and, small, arms, during, the, period, of, proto, industrialization, newly, invented, weapons, were, seen, to, be, used, in, mughal, india, rapid, development, in, military, technology, had, a, dramatic, impact, on, armies, and, navies, in, the, industrialized, world, in, 1740, 1914, for, land, warfare, cavalry, faded, in, importance, while, infantry, became, transformed, by, the, use, of, highly, accurate, more, rapidly, loading, rifles, and, the, use, of, smokeless, powder, machine, guns, were, developed, in, the, 1860s, in, europe, rocket, artillery, and, the, mysorean, rockets, were, pioneered, by, indian, muslim, ruler, tipu, sultan, and, the, french, introduced, much, more, accurate, rapid, fire, field, artillery, logistics, and, communications, support, for, land, warfare, dramatically, improved, with, use, of, railways, and, telegraphs, industrialization, provided, a, base, of, factories, that, could, be, converted, to, produce, munitions, as, well, as, uniforms, tents, wagons, and, essential, supplies, medical, facilities, were, enlarged, and, reorganized, based, on, improved, hospitals, and, the, creation, of, modern, nursing, typified, by, florence, nightingale, in, britain, during, the, crimean, war, of, 1854, 56, naval, warfare, was, transformed, by, many, innovations, most, notably, the, coal, based, steam, engine, highly, accurate, long, range, naval, guns, heavy, steel, armour, for, battleships, mines, and, the, introduction, of, the, torpedo, followed, by, the, torpedo, boat, and, the, destroyer, coal, after, 1900, was, eventually, displaced, by, more, efficient, oil, but, meanwhile, navies, with, an, international, scope, had, to, depend, on, a, network, of, coaling, stations, to, refuel, the, british, empire, provided, them, in, abundance, as, did, the, french, empire, to, a, lesser, extent, war, colleges, developed, as, military, theory, became, a, specialty, cadets, and, senior, commanders, were, taught, the, theories, of, jomini, clausewitz, and, mahan, and, engaged, in, tabletop, war, games, around, 1900, entirely, new, innovations, such, as, submarines, and, airplanes, appeared, and, were, quickly, adapted, to, warfare, by, 1914, the, british, hms, dreadnought, 1906, incorporated, so, much, of, the, latest, technology, in, weapons, propulsion, and, armour, that, it, at, a, stroke, made, all, other, battleships, obsolescent, new, financial, tools, were, developed, to, fund, the, rapidly, increasing, costs, of, warfare, such, as, popular, bond, sales, and, income, taxes, and, the, funding, of, permanent, research, centers, many, 19th, century, innovations, were, largely, invented, and, promoted, by, lone, individuals, with, small, teams, of, assistants, such, as, david, bushnell, and, the, submarine, john, ericsson, and, the, battleship, hiram, maxim, and, the, machine, gun, and, alfred, nobel, and, high, explosives, by, 1900, the, military, began, to, realize, that, they, needed, to, rely, much, more, heavily, on, large, scale, research, centers, which, needed, government, funding, they, brought, in, leaders, of, organized, innovation, such, as, thomas, edison, in, the, u, s, and, chemist, fritz, haber, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, in, germany, the, postmodern, stage, of, military, technology, emerged, in, the, 1940s, and, one, with, recognition, thanks, to, the, high, priority, given, during, the, war, to, scientific, and, engineering, research, and, development, regarding, nuclear, weapons, radar, jet, engines, proximity, fuses, advanced, submarines, aircraft, carriers, and, other, weapons, the, high, priority, continues, into, the, 21st, century, it, involves, the, military, application, of, advanced, scientific, research, regarding, nuclear, weapons, jet, engines, ballistic, and, guided, missiles, radar, biological, warfare, and, the, use, of, electronics, computers, and, software, during, the, cold, war, the, world, s, two, great, superpowers, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, of, america, spent, large, proportions, of, their, gdp, on, developing, military, technologies, the, drive, to, place, objects, in, orbit, stimulated, space, research, and, started, the, space, race, in, 1957, the, ussr, launched, the, first, artificial, satellite, sputnik, 1, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, both, countries, regularly, deployed, satellites, spy, satellites, were, used, by, militaries, to, take, accurate, pictures, of, their, rivals, military, installations, as, time, passed, the, resolution, and, accuracy, of, orbital, reconnaissance, alarmed, both, sides, of, the, iron, curtain, both, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, began, to, develop, anti, satellite, weapons, to, blind, or, destroy, each, other, s, satellites, laser, weapons, kamikaze, style, satellites, as, well, as, orbital, nuclear, explosion, were, researched, with, varying, levels, of, success, spy, satellites, were, and, continue, to, be, used, to, monitor, the, dismantling, of, military, assets, in, accordance, with, arms, control, treaties, signed, between, the, two, superpowers, to, use, spy, satellites, in, such, a, manner, is, often, referred, to, in, treaties, as, national, technical, means, of, verification, the, superpowers, developed, ballistic, missiles, to, enable, them, to, use, nuclear, weaponry, across, great, distances, as, rocket, science, developed, the, range, of, missiles, increased, and, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbm, were, created, which, could, strike, virtually, any, target, on, earth, in, a, timeframe, measured, in, minutes, rather, than, hours, or, days, to, cover, large, distances, ballistic, missiles, are, usually, launched, into, sub, orbital, spaceflight, as, soon, as, intercontinental, missiles, were, developed, military, planners, began, programmes, and, strategies, to, counter, their, effectiveness, a, significant, portion, of, military, technology, is, about, transportation, allowing, troops, and, weaponry, to, be, moved, from, their, origins, to, the, front, land, transport, has, historically, been, mainly, by, foot, land, vehicles, have, usually, been, used, as, well, from, chariots, to, tanks, when, conducting, a, battle, over, a, body, of, water, ships, are, used, there, are, historically, two, main, categories, of, ships, those, for, transporting, troops, and, those, for, attacking, other, ships, soon, after, the, invention, of, aeroplanes, military, aviation, became, a, significant, component, of, warfare, though, usually, as, a, supplementary, role, the, two, main, types, of, military, aircraft, are, bombers, which, attack, land, or, sea, based, targets, and, fighters, which, attack, other, aircraft, military, vehicles, are, land, combat, or, transportation, vehicles, excluding, rail, based, which, are, designed, for, or, in, significant, use, by, military, forces, military, aircraft, includes, any, use, of, aircraft, by, a, country, s, military, including, such, areas, as, transport, training, disaster, relief, border, patrol, search, and, rescue, surveillance, surveying, peacekeeping, and, very, rarely, aerial, warfare, warships, are, watercraft, for, combat, and, transportation, in, and, on, seas, and, oceans, fortifications, are, military, constructions, and, buildings, designed, for, defence, in, warfare, they, range, in, size, and, age, from, the, great, wall, of, china, to, a, sangar, sensors, and, communication, systems, are, used, to, detect, enemies, coordinate, movements, of, armed, forces, and, guide, weaponry, early, systems, included, flag, signaling, telegraph, and, heliographs, the, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, is, an, agency, of, the, united, states, department, of, defense, responsible, for, the, development, of, new, technologies, for, use, by, the, military, darpa, leads, the, development, of, military, technology, in, the, united, states, and, today, has, dozens, of, ongoing, projects, everything, from, humanoid, robots, to, bullets, that, can, change, path, before, reaching, their, target, china, has, a, similar, agency, current, militaries, continue, to, invest, in, new, technologies, for, the, future, such, technologies, include, cognitive, radar, 5g, cellular, networks, microchips, semiconductors, and, large, scale, analytic, engines, additionally, many, militaries, seek, to, improve, current, laser, technology, for, example, israeli, defense, forces, utilize, laser, technology, to, disable, small, enemy, machinery, but, seek, to, move, to, more, large, scale, capabilities, in, the, coming, years, militaries, across, the, world, continue, to, perform, research, on, autonomous, technologies, which, allow, for, increased, troop, mobility, or, replacement, of, live, soldiers, autonomous, vehicles, and, robots, are, expected, to, play, a, role, in, future, conflicts, this, has, the, potential, to, decrease, loss, of, life, in, future, warfare, observers, of, transhumanism, note, high, rates, of, technological, terms, in, military, literature, but, low, rates, for, explicitly, transhuman, related, terms, today, s, hybrid, style, of, warfare, also, calls, for, investments, in, information, technologies, increased, reliance, on, computer, systems, has, incentivized, nations, to, push, for, increased, efforts, at, managing, large, scale, networks, and, having, access, to, large, scale, data, new, strategies, of, cyber, and, hybrid, warfare, includes, network, attacks, media, analysis, and, media, grass, roots, campaigns, on, medias, such, as, blog, posts, in, 2011, the, us, defense, department, declared, cyberspace, a, new, domain, of, warfare, since, then, darpa, has, begun, a, research, project, known, as, project, x, with, the, goal, of, creating, new, technologies, that, will, enable, the, government, to, better, understand, and, map, the, cyber, territory, ultimately, giving, the, department, of, defense, the, ability, to, plan, and, manage, large, scale, cyber, missions, across, dynamic, network, environments
