components, of, an, electrical, circuit, are, electrically, connected, if, an, electric, current, can, run, between, them, through, an, electrical, conductor, an, electrical, connector, is, an, electromechanical, device, used, to, create, an, electrical, connection, between, parts, of, an, electrical, circuit, or, between, different, electrical, circuits, thereby, joining, them, into, a, larger, circuit, the, connection, may, be, removable, as, for, portable, equipment, require, a, tool, for, assembly, and, removal, or, serve, as, a, permanent, electrical, joint, between, two, points, an, adapter, can, be, used, to, join, dissimilar, connectors, most, electrical, connectors, have, a, gender, i, e, the, male, component, called, a, plug, connects, to, the, female, component, or, socket, thousands, of, configurations, of, connectors, are, manufactured, for, power, data, and, audiovisual, applications, electrical, connectors, can, be, divided, into, four, basic, categories, differentiated, by, their, function, in, computing, electrical, connectors, are, considered, a, physical, interface, and, constitute, part, of, the, physical, layer, in, the, osi, model, of, networking, in, addition, to, the, classes, mentioned, above, connectors, are, characterised, by, their, pinout, method, of, connection, materials, size, contact, resistance, insulation, mechanical, durability, ingress, protection, lifetime, number, of, cycles, and, ease, of, use, it, is, usually, desirable, for, a, connector, to, be, easy, to, identify, visually, rapid, to, assemble, inexpensive, and, require, only, simple, tooling, in, some, cases, an, equipment, manufacturer, might, choose, a, connector, specifically, because, it, is, not, compatible, with, those, from, other, sources, allowing, control, of, what, may, be, connected, no, single, connector, has, all, the, ideal, properties, for, every, application, the, proliferation, of, types, is, a, result, of, the, diverse, yet, specific, requirements, of, manufacturers, 6, electrical, connectors, essentially, consist, of, two, classes, of, materials, conductors, and, insulators, properties, important, to, conductor, materials, are, contact, resistance, conductivity, mechanical, strength, formability, and, resilience, insulators, must, have, a, high, electrical, resistance, withstand, high, temperatures, and, be, easy, to, manufacture, for, a, precise, fit, electrodes, in, connectors, are, usually, made, of, copper, alloys, due, to, their, good, conductivity, and, malleability, 15, alternatives, include, brass, phosphor, bronze, and, beryllium, copper, the, base, electrode, metal, is, often, coated, with, another, inert, metal, such, as, gold, nickel, or, tin, the, use, of, a, coating, material, with, good, conductivity, mechanical, robustness, and, corrosion, resistance, helps, to, reduce, the, influence, of, passivating, oxide, layers, and, surface, adsorbates, which, limit, metal, to, metal, contact, patches, and, contribute, to, contact, resistance, for, example, copper, alloys, have, favorable, mechanical, properties, for, electrodes, but, are, hard, to, solder, and, prone, to, corrosion, thus, copper, pins, are, usually, coated, with, gold, to, alleviate, these, pitfalls, especially, for, analog, signals, and, high, reliability, applications, contact, carriers, that, hold, the, parts, of, a, connector, together, are, usually, made, of, plastic, due, to, its, insulating, properties, housings, or, backshells, can, be, made, of, molded, plastic, and, metal, 15, connector, bodies, for, high, temperature, use, such, as, thermocouples, or, associated, with, large, incandescent, lamps, may, be, made, of, fired, ceramic, material, the, majority, of, connector, failures, result, in, intermittent, connections, or, open, contacts, connectors, are, purely, passive, components, that, is, they, do, not, enhance, the, function, of, a, circuit, so, connectors, should, affect, the, function, of, a, circuit, as, little, as, possible, insecure, mounting, of, connectors, primarily, chassis, mounted, can, contribute, significantly, to, the, risk, of, failure, especially, when, subjected, to, extreme, shock, or, vibration, other, causes, of, failure, are, connectors, inadequately, rated, for, the, applied, current, and, voltage, connectors, with, inadequate, ingress, protection, and, threaded, backshells, that, are, worn, or, damaged, high, temperatures, can, also, cause, failure, in, connectors, resulting, in, an, avalanche, of, failures, ambient, temperature, increases, leading, to, a, decrease, in, insulation, resistance, and, increase, in, conductor, resistance, this, increase, generates, more, heat, and, the, cycle, repeats, fretting, so, called, dynamic, corrosion, is, a, common, failure, mode, in, electrical, connectors, that, have, not, been, specifically, designed, to, prevent, it, especially, in, those, that, are, frequently, mated, and, de, mated, surface, corrosion, is, a, risk, for, many, metal, parts, in, connectors, and, can, cause, contacts, to, form, a, thin, surface, layer, that, increases, resistance, thus, contributing, to, heat, buildup, and, intermittent, connections, however, remating, or, reseating, a, connector, can, alleviate, the, issue, of, surface, corrosion, since, each, cycle, scrapes, a, microscopic, layer, off, the, surface, of, the, contact, s, exposing, a, fresh, unoxidised, surface, many, connectors, used, for, industrial, and, high, reliability, applications, are, circular, in, cross, section, with, a, cylindrical, housing, and, circular, contact, interface, geometries, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, rectangular, design, of, some, connectors, e, g, usb, or, blade, connectors, they, are, commonly, used, for, easier, engagement, and, disengagement, tight, environmental, sealing, and, rugged, mechanical, performance, they, are, widely, used, in, military, aerospace, industrial, machinery, and, rail, where, mil, dtl, 5015, and, mil, dtl, 38999, are, commonly, specified, fields, such, as, sound, engineering, and, radio, communication, also, use, circular, connectors, such, as, xlr, and, bnc, ac, power, plugs, are, also, commonly, circular, for, example, schuko, plugs, and, iec, 60309, the, m12, connector, specified, in, iec, 61076, 2, 101, is, a, circular, electrical, plug, receptacle, pair, with, 12mm, od, mating, threads, used, in, nmea, 2000, devicenet, io, link, some, kinds, of, industrial, ethernet, etc, a, disadvantage, of, the, circular, design, is, its, inefficient, use, of, panel, space, when, used, in, arrays, when, compared, to, rectangular, connectors, circular, connectors, commonly, use, backshells, which, provide, physical, and, electromagnetic, protection, whilst, sometimes, also, providing, a, method, for, locking, the, connector, into, a, receptacle, in, some, cases, this, backshell, provides, a, hermetic, seal, or, some, degree, of, ingress, protection, through, the, use, of, grommets, o, rings, or, potting, hybrid, connectors, allow, the, intermixing, of, many, connector, types, usually, by, way, of, a, housing, with, inserts, these, housings, may, also, allow, intermixing, of, electrical, and, non, electrical, interfaces, examples, of, the, latter, being, pneumatic, line, connectors, and, optical, fiber, connectors, because, hybrid, connectors, are, modular, in, nature, they, tend, to, simplify, assembly, repair, and, future, modifications, they, also, allow, the, creation, of, composite, cable, assemblies, that, can, reduce, equipment, installation, time, by, reducing, the, number, of, individual, cable, and, connector, assemblies, some, connectors, are, designed, such, that, certain, pins, make, contact, before, others, when, inserted, and, break, first, on, disconnection, this, is, often, used, in, power, connectors, to, protect, equipment, e, g, connecting, safety, ground, first, it, is, also, employed, for, digital, signals, as, a, method, to, sequence, connections, properly, in, hot, swapping, many, connectors, are, keyed, with, some, mechanical, component, sometimes, called, a, keyway, which, prevents, mating, in, an, incorrect, orientation, this, can, be, used, to, prevent, mechanical, damage, to, connectors, from, being, jammed, in, at, the, wrong, angle, or, into, the, wrong, connector, or, to, prevent, incompatible, or, dangerous, electrical, connections, such, as, plugging, an, audio, cable, into, a, power, outlet, keying, also, prevents, otherwise, symmetrical, connectors, from, being, connected, in, the, wrong, orientation, or, polarity, keying, is, particularly, important, for, situations, where, there, are, many, similar, connectors, such, as, in, signal, electronics, 26, for, instance, xlr, connectors, have, a, notch, to, ensure, proper, orientation, while, mini, din, plugs, have, a, plastic, projection, that, fits, into, a, corresponding, hole, in, the, socket, they, also, have, a, notched, metal, skirt, to, provide, secondary, keying, some, connector, housings, are, designed, with, locking, mechanisms, to, prevent, inadvertent, disconnection, or, poor, environmental, sealing, locking, mechanism, designs, include, locking, levers, of, various, sorts, jackscrews, screw, in, shells, push, pull, connector, and, toggle, or, bayonet, systems, some, connectors, particularly, those, with, large, numbers, of, contacts, require, high, forces, to, connect, and, disconnect, locking, levers, and, jackscrews, and, screw, in, shells, for, such, connectors, frequently, serve, both, to, retain, the, connector, when, connected, and, to, provide, the, force, needed, for, connection, and, disconnection, depending, on, application, requirements, housings, with, locking, mechanisms, may, be, tested, under, various, environmental, simulations, that, include, physical, shock, and, vibration, water, spray, dust, etc, to, ensure, the, integrity, of, the, electrical, connection, and, housing, seals, backshells, are, a, common, accessory, for, industrial, and, high, reliability, connectors, especially, circular, connectors, backshells, typically, protect, the, connector, and, or, cable, from, environmental, or, mechanical, stress, or, shield, it, from, electromagnetic, interference, many, types, of, backshells, are, available, for, different, purposes, including, various, sizes, shapes, materials, and, levels, of, protection, backshells, usually, lock, onto, the, cable, with, a, clamp, or, moulded, boot, and, may, be, threaded, for, attachment, to, a, mating, receptacle, backshells, for, military, and, aerospace, use, are, regulated, by, sae, as85049, within, the, usa, to, deliver, ensured, signal, stability, in, extreme, environments, traditional, pin, and, socket, design, may, become, inadequate, hyperboloid, contacts, are, designed, to, withstand, more, extreme, physical, demands, such, as, vibration, and, shock, they, also, require, around, 40, less, insertion, force, as, low, as, 0, 3, newtons, 1, oz, f, per, contact, which, extends, the, lifespan, and, in, some, cases, offers, an, alternative, to, zero, insertion, force, connectors, in, a, connector, with, hyperboloid, contacts, each, female, contact, has, several, equally, spaced, longitudinal, wires, twisted, into, a, hyperbolic, shape, these, wires, are, highly, resilient, to, strain, but, still, somewhat, elastic, hence, they, essentially, function, as, linear, springs, as, the, male, pin, is, inserted, axial, wires, in, the, socket, half, are, deflected, wrapping, themselves, around, the, pin, to, provide, a, number, of, contact, points, the, internal, wires, that, form, the, hyperboloid, structure, are, usually, anchored, at, each, end, by, bending, the, tip, into, a, groove, or, notch, in, the, housing, whilst, hyperboloid, contacts, may, be, the, only, option, to, make, a, reliable, connection, in, some, circumstances, they, have, the, disadvantage, of, taking, up, greater, volume, in, a, connector, which, can, cause, problems, for, high, density, connectors, they, are, also, significantly, more, expensive, than, traditional, pin, and, socket, contacts, which, has, limited, their, uptake, since, their, invention, in, the, 1920s, by, wilhelm, harold, frederick, in, the, 1950s, francois, bonhomme, popularised, hyperboloid, contacts, with, his, hypertac, connector, which, was, later, acquired, by, smiths, group, during, the, following, decades, the, connectors, steadily, gained, popularity, and, are, still, used, for, medical, industrial, military, aerospace, and, rail, applications, particularly, trains, in, europe, pogo, pin, or, spring, loaded, connectors, are, commonly, used, in, consumer, and, industrial, products, where, mechanical, resilience, and, ease, of, use, are, priorities, the, connector, consists, of, a, barrel, a, spring, and, a, plunger, they, are, in, applications, such, as, the, magsafe, connector, where, a, quick, disconnect, is, desired, for, safety, because, they, rely, on, spring, pressure, not, friction, they, can, be, more, durable, and, less, damaging, than, traditional, pin, and, socket, design, leading, to, their, use, in, in, circuit, testing, crown, spring, connectors, are, commonly, used, for, higher, current, flows, and, industrial, applications, they, have, a, high, number, of, contact, points, which, provides, a, more, electrically, reliable, connection, than, traditional, pin, and, socket, connectors, whilst, technically, inaccurate, electrical, connectors, can, be, viewed, as, a, type, of, adapter, to, convert, between, two, connection, methods, which, are, permanently, connected, at, one, end, and, usually, detachable, at, the, other, end, 40, by, definition, each, end, of, this, adapter, has, a, different, connection, method, e, g, the, solder, tabs, on, a, male, phone, connector, and, the, male, phone, connector, itself, in, this, example, the, solder, tabs, connected, to, the, cable, represent, the, permanent, connection, whilst, the, male, connector, portion, interfaces, with, a, female, socket, forming, a, detachable, connection, there, are, many, ways, of, applying, a, connector, to, a, cable, or, device, some, of, these, methods, can, be, accomplished, without, specialized, tools, other, methods, while, requiring, a, special, tool, can, assemble, connectors, much, faster, and, more, reliably, and, make, repairs, easier, the, number, of, times, a, connector, can, connect, and, disconnect, with, its, counterpart, while, meeting, all, its, specifications, is, termed, as, mating, cycles, and, is, an, indirect, measure, of, connector, lifespan, the, material, used, for, connector, contact, plating, type, and, thickness, is, a, major, factor, that, determines, the, mating, cycles, plug, and, socket, connectors, are, usually, made, up, of, a, male, plug, typically, pin, contacts, and, a, female, socket, typically, receptacle, contacts, often, but, not, always, sockets, are, permanently, fixed, to, a, device, as, in, a, chassis, connector, see, above, and, plugs, are, attached, to, a, cable, plugs, generally, have, one, or, more, pins, or, prongs, that, are, inserted, into, openings, in, the, mating, socket, the, connection, between, the, mating, metal, parts, must, be, sufficiently, tight, to, make, a, good, electrical, connection, and, complete, the, circuit, an, alternative, type, of, plug, and, socket, connection, uses, hyperboloid, contacts, which, makes, a, more, reliable, electrical, connection, when, working, with, multi, pin, connectors, it, is, helpful, to, have, a, pinout, diagram, to, identify, the, wire, or, circuit, node, connected, to, each, pin, some, connector, styles, may, combine, pin, and, socket, connection, types, in, a, single, unit, referred, to, as, a, hermaphroditic, connector, 56, these, connectors, includes, mating, with, both, male, and, female, aspects, involving, complementary, paired, identical, parts, each, containing, both, protrusions, and, indentations, these, mating, surfaces, are, mounted, into, identical, fittings, that, freely, mate, with, any, other, without, regard, for, gender, provided, that, the, size, and, type, match, sometimes, both, ends, of, a, cable, are, terminated, with, the, same, gender, of, connector, as, in, many, ethernet, patch, cables, in, other, applications, the, two, ends, are, terminated, differently, either, with, male, and, female, of, the, same, connector, as, in, an, extension, cord, or, with, incompatible, connectors, which, is, sometimes, called, an, adapter, cable, plugs, and, sockets, are, widely, used, in, various, connector, systems, including, blade, connectors, breadboards, xlr, connectors, car, power, outlets, banana, connectors, and, phone, connectors, a, jack, is, a, connector, that, installs, on, the, surface, of, a, bulkhead, or, enclosure, and, mates, with, its, reciprocal, the, plug, according, to, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, the, stationary, more, fixed, connector, of, a, pair, is, classified, as, a, jack, denoted, j, usually, attached, to, a, piece, of, equipment, as, in, a, chassis, mount, or, panel, mount, connector, the, movable, less, fixed, connector, is, classified, as, a, plug, denoted, p, designed, to, attach, to, a, wire, cable, or, removable, electrical, assembly, this, convention, is, currently, defined, in, asme, y14, 44, 2008, which, supersedes, ieee, 200, 1975, which, in, turn, derives, from, the, long, withdrawn, mil, std, 16, from, the, 1950s, highlighting, the, heritage, of, this, connector, naming, convention, ieee, 315, 1975, works, alongside, asme, y14, 44, 2008, to, define, jacks, and, plugs, the, term, jack, occurs, in, several, related, terms, crimped, connectors, are, a, type, of, solderless, connection, using, mechanical, friction, and, uniform, deformation, to, secure, a, connector, to, a, pre, stripped, wire, usually, stranded, crimping, is, used, in, splice, connectors, crimped, multipin, plugs, and, sockets, and, crimped, coaxial, connectors, crimping, usually, requires, a, specialised, crimping, tool, but, the, connectors, are, quick, and, easy, to, install, and, are, a, common, alternative, to, solder, connections, or, insulation, displacement, connectors, effective, crimp, connections, deform, the, metal, of, the, connector, past, its, yield, point, so, that, the, compressed, wire, causes, tension, in, the, surrounding, connector, and, these, forces, counter, each, other, to, create, a, high, degree, of, static, friction, due, to, the, elastic, element, in, crimped, connections, they, are, highly, resistant, to, vibration, and, thermal, shock, crimped, contacts, are, permanent, i, e, the, connectors, and, wire, ends, cannot, be, reused, crimped, plug, and, socket, connectors, can, be, classified, as, rear, release, or, front, release, this, relates, to, the, side, of, the, connector, where, the, pins, are, anchored, many, plug, and, socket, connectors, are, attached, to, a, wire, or, cable, by, soldering, conductors, to, electrodes, on, the, back, of, the, connector, soldered, joints, in, connectors, are, robust, and, reliable, if, executed, correctly, but, are, usually, slower, to, make, than, crimped, connections, when, wires, are, to, be, soldered, to, the, back, of, a, connector, a, backshell, is, often, used, to, protect, the, connection, and, add, strain, relief, metal, solder, buckets, or, solder, cups, are, provided, which, consist, of, a, cylindrical, cavity, that, an, installer, fills, with, solder, before, inserting, the, wire, when, creating, soldered, connections, it, is, possible, to, melt, the, dielectric, between, pins, or, wires, this, can, cause, problems, because, the, thermal, conductivity, of, metals, causes, heat, to, quickly, distribute, through, the, cable, and, connector, and, when, this, heat, melts, plastic, dielectric, it, can, cause, short, circuits, or, flared, conical, insulation, solder, joints, are, also, more, prone, to, mechanical, failure, than, crimped, joints, when, subjected, to, vibration, and, compression, since, stripping, insulation, from, wires, is, time, consuming, many, connectors, intended, for, rapid, assembly, use, insulation, displacement, connectors, which, cut, the, insulation, as, the, wire, is, inserted, these, generally, take, the, form, of, a, fork, shaped, opening, in, the, terminal, into, which, the, insulated, wire, is, pressed, which, cut, through, the, insulation, to, contact, the, conductor, to, make, these, connections, reliably, on, a, production, line, special, tools, accurately, control, the, forces, applied, during, assembly, on, small, scales, these, tools, tend, to, cost, more, than, tools, for, crimped, connections, insulation, displacement, connectors, are, usually, used, with, small, conductors, for, signal, purposes, and, at, low, voltage, power, conductors, carrying, more, than, a, few, amperes, are, more, reliably, terminated, with, other, means, though, hot, tap, press, on, connectors, find, some, use, in, automotive, applications, for, additions, to, existing, wiring, a, common, example, is, the, multi, conductor, flat, ribbon, cable, used, in, computer, disk, drives, to, terminate, each, of, the, many, approximately, 40, wires, individually, would, be, slow, and, error, prone, but, an, insulation, displacement, connector, can, terminate, all, the, wires, in, a, single, action, another, very, common, use, is, so, called, punch, down, blocks, used, for, terminating, unshielded, twisted, pair, wiring, binding, posts, are, a, single, wire, connection, method, where, stripped, wire, is, screwed, or, clamped, to, a, metal, electrode, such, connectors, are, frequently, used, in, electronic, test, equipment, and, audio, many, binding, posts, also, accept, a, banana, plug, screw, connections, are, frequently, used, for, semi, permanent, wiring, and, connections, inside, devices, due, to, their, simple, but, reliable, construction, the, basic, principle, of, all, screw, terminals, involves, the, tip, of, a, bolt, clamping, onto, a, stripped, conductor, they, can, be, used, to, join, multiple, conductors, to, connect, wires, to, a, printed, circuit, board, or, to, terminate, a, cable, into, a, plug, or, socket, 50, the, clamping, screw, may, act, in, the, longitudinal, axis, parallel, to, the, wire, or, the, transverse, axis, perpendicular, to, the, wire, or, both, some, disadvantages, are, that, connecting, wires, is, more, difficult, than, simply, plugging, in, a, cable, and, screw, terminals, are, generally, not, very, well, protected, from, contact, with, persons, or, foreign, conducting, materials, terminal, blocks, also, called, terminal, boards, or, strips, provide, a, convenient, means, of, connecting, individual, electrical, wires, without, a, splice, or, physically, joining, the, ends, since, terminal, blocks, are, readily, available, for, a, wide, range, of, wire, sizes, and, terminal, quantity, they, are, one, of, the, most, flexible, types, of, electrical, connector, available, one, type, of, terminal, block, accepts, wires, that, are, prepared, only, by, stripping, a, short, length, of, insulation, from, the, end, another, type, often, called, barrier, strips, accepts, wires, that, have, ring, or, spade, terminal, lugs, crimped, onto, the, wires, printed, circuit, board, pcb, mounted, screw, terminals, let, individual, wires, connect, to, a, pcb, through, leads, soldered, to, the, board, the, connectors, in, the, top, row, of, the, image, are, known, as, ring, terminals, and, spade, terminals, sometimes, called, fork, or, split, ring, terminals, electrical, contact, is, made, by, the, flat, surface, of, the, ring, or, spade, while, mechanically, they, are, attached, by, passing, a, screw, or, bolt, through, them, the, spade, terminal, form, factor, facilitates, connections, since, the, screw, or, bolt, can, be, left, partially, screwed, in, as, the, spade, terminal, is, removed, or, attached, their, sizes, can, be, determined, by, the, gauge, of, the, conducting, wire, and, the, interior, and, exterior, diameters, in, the, case, of, insulated, crimp, connectors, the, crimped, area, lies, under, an, insulating, sleeve, through, which, the, pressing, force, acts, during, crimping, the, extended, end, of, this, insulating, sleeve, is, simultaneously, pressed, around, the, insulated, area, of, the, cable, creating, strain, relief, the, insulating, sleeve, of, insulated, connectors, has, a, color, that, indicates, the, wire, s, cross, section, area, colors, are, standardized, according, to, din, 46245, a, blade, connector, is, a, type, of, single, wire, plug, and, socket, connection, device, using, a, flat, conductive, blade, plug, that, is, inserted, into, a, receptacle, wires, are, typically, attached, to, male, or, female, blade, connector, terminals, by, either, crimping, or, soldering, insulated, and, uninsulated, varieties, are, available, in, some, cases, the, blade, is, an, integral, manufactured, part, of, a, component, such, as, a, switch, or, a, speaker, unit, and, the, reciprocal, connector, terminal, is, pushed, onto, the, device, s, connector, terminal, media, related, to, electrical, connectors, at, wikimedia, commons
