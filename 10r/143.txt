in, electrical, engineering, a, switch, is, an, electrical, component, that, can, disconnect, or, connect, the, conducting, path, in, an, electrical, circuit, interrupting, the, electric, current, or, diverting, it, from, one, conductor, to, another, the, most, common, type, of, switch, is, an, electromechanical, device, consisting, of, one, or, more, sets, of, movable, electrical, contacts, connected, to, external, circuits, when, a, pair, of, contacts, is, touching, current, can, pass, between, them, while, when, the, contacts, are, separated, no, current, can, flow, switches, are, made, in, many, different, configurations, they, may, have, multiple, sets, of, contacts, controlled, by, the, same, knob, or, actuator, and, the, contacts, may, operate, simultaneously, sequentially, or, alternately, a, switch, may, be, operated, manually, for, example, a, light, switch, or, a, keyboard, button, or, may, function, as, a, sensing, element, to, sense, the, position, of, a, machine, part, liquid, level, pressure, or, temperature, such, as, a, thermostat, many, specialized, forms, exist, such, as, the, toggle, switch, rotary, switch, mercury, switch, push, button, switch, reversing, switch, relay, and, circuit, breaker, a, common, use, is, control, of, lighting, where, multiple, switches, may, be, wired, into, one, circuit, to, allow, convenient, control, of, light, fixtures, switches, in, high, powered, circuits, must, have, special, construction, to, prevent, destructive, arcing, when, they, are, opened, the, most, familiar, form, of, switch, is, a, manually, operated, electromechanical, device, with, one, or, more, sets, of, electrical, contacts, which, are, connected, to, external, circuits, each, set, of, contacts, can, be, in, one, of, two, states, either, closed, meaning, the, contacts, are, touching, and, electricity, can, flow, between, them, or, open, meaning, the, contacts, are, separated, and, the, switch, is, nonconducting, the, mechanism, actuating, the, transition, between, these, two, states, open, or, closed, is, usually, there, are, other, types, of, actions, either, an, alternate, action, flip, the, switch, for, continuous, on, or, off, or, momentary, push, for, on, and, release, for, off, type, a, switch, may, be, directly, manipulated, by, a, human, as, a, control, signal, to, a, system, such, as, a, computer, keyboard, button, or, to, control, power, flow, in, a, circuit, such, as, a, light, switch, automatically, operated, switches, can, be, used, to, control, the, motions, of, machines, for, example, to, indicate, that, a, garage, door, has, reached, its, full, open, position, or, that, a, machine, tool, is, in, a, position, to, accept, another, workpiece, switches, may, be, operated, by, process, variables, such, as, pressure, temperature, flow, current, voltage, and, force, acting, as, sensors, in, a, process, and, used, to, automatically, control, a, system, for, example, a, thermostat, is, a, temperature, operated, switch, used, to, control, a, heating, process, a, switch, that, is, operated, by, another, electrical, circuit, is, called, a, relay, large, switches, may, be, remotely, operated, by, a, motor, drive, mechanism, some, switches, are, used, to, isolate, electric, power, from, a, system, providing, a, visible, point, of, isolation, that, can, be, padlocked, if, necessary, to, prevent, accidental, operation, of, a, machine, during, maintenance, or, to, prevent, electric, shock, an, ideal, switch, would, have, no, voltage, drop, when, closed, and, would, have, no, limits, on, voltage, or, current, rating, it, would, have, zero, rise, time, and, fall, time, during, state, changes, and, would, change, state, without, bouncing, between, on, and, off, positions, practical, switches, fall, short, of, this, ideal, as, the, result, of, roughness, and, oxide, films, they, exhibit, contact, resistance, limits, on, the, current, and, voltage, they, can, handle, finite, switching, time, etc, the, ideal, switch, is, often, used, in, circuit, analysis, as, it, greatly, simplifies, the, system, of, equations, to, be, solved, but, this, can, lead, to, a, less, accurate, solution, theoretical, treatment, of, the, effects, of, non, ideal, properties, is, required, in, the, design, of, large, networks, of, switches, as, for, example, used, in, telephone, exchanges, in, the, simplest, case, a, switch, has, two, conductive, pieces, often, metal, called, contacts, connected, to, an, external, circuit, that, touch, to, complete, make, the, circuit, and, separate, to, open, break, the, circuit, the, contact, material, is, chosen, for, its, resistance, to, corrosion, because, most, metals, form, insulating, oxides, that, would, prevent, the, switch, from, working, contact, materials, are, also, chosen, on, the, basis, of, electrical, conductivity, hardness, resistance, to, abrasive, wear, mechanical, strength, low, cost, and, low, toxicity, the, formation, of, oxide, layers, at, contact, surface, as, well, as, surface, roughness, and, contact, pressure, determine, the, contact, resistance, and, wetting, current, of, a, mechanical, switch, sometimes, the, contacts, are, plated, with, noble, metals, for, their, excellent, conductivity, and, resistance, to, corrosion, they, may, be, designed, to, wipe, against, each, other, to, clean, off, any, contamination, nonmetallic, conductors, such, as, conductive, plastic, are, sometimes, used, to, prevent, the, formation, of, insulating, oxides, a, minimum, wetting, current, may, be, specified, for, a, given, switch, design, in, electronics, switches, are, classified, according, to, the, arrangement, of, their, contacts, a, pair, of, contacts, is, said, to, be, closed, when, current, can, flow, from, one, to, the, other, when, the, contacts, are, separated, by, an, insulating, air, gap, they, are, said, to, be, open, and, no, current, can, flow, between, them, at, normal, voltages, the, terms, make, for, closure, of, contacts, and, break, for, opening, of, contacts, are, also, widely, used, the, terms, pole, and, throw, are, also, used, to, describe, switch, contact, variations, the, number, of, poles, is, the, number, of, electrically, separate, switches, which, are, controlled, by, a, single, physical, actuator, for, example, a, 2, pole, switch, has, two, separate, parallel, sets, of, contacts, that, open, and, close, in, unison, via, the, same, mechanism, the, number, of, throws, is, the, number, of, separate, wiring, path, choices, other, than, open, that, the, switch, can, adopt, for, each, pole, a, single, throw, switch, has, one, pair, of, contacts, that, can, either, be, closed, or, open, a, double, throw, switch, has, a, contact, that, can, be, connected, to, either, of, two, other, contacts, a, triple, throw, has, a, contact, which, can, be, connected, to, one, of, three, other, contacts, etc, in, a, switch, where, the, contacts, remain, in, one, state, unless, actuated, such, as, a, push, button, switch, the, contacts, can, either, be, normally, open, abbreviated, n, o, or, no, until, closed, by, operation, of, the, switch, or, normally, closed, n, c, or, nc, and, opened, by, the, switch, action, a, switch, with, both, types, of, contact, is, called, a, changeover, switch, or, double, throw, switch, these, may, be, make, before, break, mbb, or, shorting, which, momentarily, connects, both, circuits, or, may, be, break, before, make, bbm, or, non, shorting, which, interrupts, one, circuit, before, closing, the, other, these, terms, have, given, rise, to, abbreviations, for, the, types, of, switch, which, are, used, in, the, electronics, industry, such, as, single, pole, single, throw, spst, the, simplest, type, on, or, off, or, single, pole, double, throw, spdt, connecting, either, of, two, terminals, to, the, common, terminal, in, electrical, power, wiring, i, e, house, and, building, wiring, by, electricians, names, generally, involve, the, suffix, way, however, these, terms, differ, between, british, english, and, american, english, i, e, the, terms, two, way, and, three, way, are, used, with, different, meanings, form, a, switches, with, larger, numbers, of, poles, or, throws, can, be, described, by, replacing, the, s, or, d, with, a, number, e, g, 3pst, sp4t, etc, or, in, some, cases, the, letter, t, for, triple, or, q, for, quadruple, in, the, rest, of, this, article, the, terms, spst, spdt, and, intermediate, will, be, used, to, avoid, the, ambiguity, contact, bounce, also, called, chatter, is, a, common, problem, with, mechanical, switches, relays, and, battery, contacts, which, arises, as, the, result, of, electrical, contact, resistance, ecr, phenomena, at, interfaces, switch, and, relay, contacts, are, usually, made, of, springy, metals, when, the, contacts, strike, together, their, momentum, and, elasticity, act, together, to, cause, them, to, bounce, apart, one, or, more, times, before, making, steady, contact, the, result, is, a, rapidly, pulsed, electric, current, instead, of, a, clean, transition, from, zero, to, full, current, the, effect, is, usually, unimportant, in, power, circuits, but, causes, problems, in, some, analogue, and, logic, circuits, that, respond, fast, enough, to, misinterpret, the, on, off, pulses, as, a, data, stream, in, the, design, of, micro, contacts, controlling, surface, structure, surface, roughness, and, minimizing, the, formation, of, passivated, layers, on, metallic, surfaces, are, instrumental, in, inhibiting, chatter, in, the, hammond, organ, multiple, wires, are, pressed, together, under, the, piano, keys, of, the, manuals, their, bouncing, and, non, synchronous, closing, of, the, switches, is, known, as, hammond, click, and, compositions, exist, that, use, and, emphasize, this, feature, some, electronic, organs, have, a, switchable, replica, of, this, sound, effect, the, effects, of, contact, bounce, can, be, eliminated, by, all, of, these, methods, are, referred, to, as, debouncing, when, the, power, being, switched, is, sufficiently, large, the, electron, flow, across, opening, switch, contacts, is, sufficient, to, ionize, the, air, molecules, across, the, tiny, gap, between, the, contacts, as, the, switch, is, opened, forming, a, gas, plasma, also, known, as, an, electric, arc, the, plasma, is, of, low, resistance, and, is, able, to, sustain, power, flow, even, with, the, separation, distance, between, the, switch, contacts, steadily, increasing, the, plasma, is, also, very, hot, and, is, capable, of, eroding, the, metal, surfaces, of, the, switch, contacts, the, same, true, for, vacuum, switches, electric, current, arcing, causes, significant, degradation, of, the, contacts, and, also, significant, electromagnetic, interference, emi, requiring, the, use, of, arc, suppression, methods, where, the, voltage, is, sufficiently, high, an, arc, can, also, form, as, the, switch, is, closed, and, the, contacts, approach, if, the, voltage, potential, is, sufficient, to, exceed, the, breakdown, voltage, of, the, air, separating, the, contacts, an, arc, forms, which, is, sustained, until, the, switch, closes, completely, and, the, switch, surfaces, make, contact, in, either, case, the, standard, method, for, minimizing, arc, formation, and, preventing, contact, damage, is, to, use, a, fast, moving, switch, mechanism, typically, using, a, spring, operated, tipping, point, mechanism, to, assure, quick, motion, of, switch, contacts, regardless, of, the, speed, at, which, the, switch, control, is, operated, by, the, user, movement, of, the, switch, control, lever, applies, tension, to, a, spring, until, a, tipping, point, is, reached, and, the, contacts, suddenly, snap, open, or, closed, as, the, spring, tension, is, released, as, the, power, being, switched, increases, other, methods, are, used, to, minimize, or, prevent, arc, formation, a, plasma, is, hot, and, will, rise, due, to, convection, air, currents, the, arc, can, be, quenched, with, a, series, of, non, conductive, blades, spanning, the, distance, between, switch, contacts, and, as, the, arc, rises, its, length, increases, as, it, forms, ridges, rising, into, the, spaces, between, the, blades, until, the, arc, is, too, long, to, stay, sustained, and, is, extinguished, a, puffer, may, be, used, to, blow, a, sudden, high, velocity, burst, of, gas, across, the, switch, contacts, which, rapidly, extends, the, length, of, the, arc, to, extinguish, it, quickly, extremely, large, switches, often, have, switch, contacts, surrounded, by, something, other, than, air, to, more, rapidly, extinguish, the, arc, for, example, the, switch, contacts, may, operate, in, a, vacuum, immersed, in, mineral, oil, or, in, sulfur, hexafluoride, in, ac, power, service, the, current, periodically, passes, through, zero, this, effect, makes, it, harder, to, sustain, an, arc, on, opening, manufacturers, may, rate, switches, with, lower, voltage, or, current, rating, when, used, in, dc, circuits, when, a, switch, is, designed, to, switch, significant, power, the, transitional, state, of, the, switch, as, well, as, the, ability, to, withstand, continuous, operating, currents, must, be, considered, when, a, switch, is, in, the, on, state, its, resistance, is, near, zero, and, very, little, power, is, dropped, in, the, contacts, when, a, switch, is, in, the, off, state, its, resistance, is, extremely, high, and, even, less, power, is, dropped, in, the, contacts, however, when, the, switch, is, flicked, the, resistance, must, pass, through, a, state, where, a, quarter, of, the, load, s, rated, power, or, worse, if, the, load, is, not, purely, resistive, is, briefly, dropped, in, the, switch, for, this, reason, power, switches, intended, to, interrupt, a, load, current, have, spring, mechanisms, to, make, sure, the, transition, between, on, and, off, is, as, short, as, possible, regardless, of, the, speed, at, which, the, user, moves, the, rocker, power, switches, usually, come, in, two, types, a, momentary, on, off, switch, such, as, on, a, laser, pointer, usually, takes, the, form, of, a, button, and, only, closes, the, circuit, when, the, button, is, depressed, a, regular, on, off, switch, such, as, on, a, flashlight, has, a, constant, on, off, feature, dual, action, switches, incorporate, both, of, these, features, when, a, strongly, inductive, load, such, as, an, electric, motor, is, switched, off, the, current, cannot, drop, instantaneously, to, zero, a, spark, will, jump, across, the, opening, contacts, switches, for, inductive, loads, must, be, rated, to, handle, these, cases, the, spark, will, cause, electromagnetic, interference, if, not, suppressed, a, snubber, network, of, a, resistor, and, capacitor, in, series, will, quell, the, spark, when, turned, on, an, incandescent, lamp, draws, a, large, inrush, current, of, about, ten, times, the, steady, state, current, as, the, filament, heats, up, its, resistance, rises, and, the, current, decreases, to, a, steady, state, value, a, switch, designed, for, an, incandescent, lamp, load, can, withstand, this, inrush, current, wetting, current, is, the, minimum, current, needing, to, flow, through, a, mechanical, switch, while, it, is, operated, to, break, through, any, film, of, oxidation, that, may, have, been, deposited, on, the, switch, contacts, the, film, of, oxidation, occurs, often, in, areas, with, high, humidity, providing, a, sufficient, amount, of, wetting, current, is, a, crucial, step, in, designing, systems, that, use, delicate, switches, with, small, contact, pressure, as, sensor, inputs, failing, to, do, this, might, result, in, switches, remaining, electrically, open, due, to, contact, oxidation, the, moving, part, that, applies, the, operating, force, to, the, contacts, is, called, the, actuator, and, may, be, a, toggle, or, dolly, a, rocker, a, push, button, or, any, type, of, mechanical, linkage, see, photo, a, switch, normally, maintains, its, set, position, once, operated, a, biased, switch, contains, a, mechanism, that, springs, it, into, another, position, when, released, by, an, operator, the, momentary, push, button, switch, is, a, type, of, biased, switch, the, most, common, type, is, a, push, to, make, or, normally, open, or, no, switch, which, makes, contact, when, the, button, is, pressed, and, breaks, when, the, button, is, released, each, key, of, a, computer, keyboard, for, example, is, a, normally, open, push, to, make, switch, a, push, to, break, or, normally, closed, or, nc, switch, on, the, other, hand, breaks, contact, when, the, button, is, pressed, and, makes, contact, when, it, is, released, an, example, of, a, push, to, break, switch, is, a, button, used, to, release, a, door, held, closed, by, an, electromagnet, the, interior, lamp, of, a, household, refrigerator, is, controlled, by, a, switch, that, is, held, open, when, the, door, is, closed, a, rotary, switch, operates, with, a, twisting, motion, of, the, operating, handle, with, at, least, two, positions, one, or, more, positions, of, the, switch, may, be, momentary, biased, with, a, spring, requiring, the, operator, to, hold, the, switch, in, the, position, other, positions, may, have, a, detent, to, hold, the, position, when, released, a, rotary, switch, may, have, multiple, levels, or, decks, in, order, to, allow, it, to, control, multiple, circuits, one, form, of, rotary, switch, consists, of, a, spindle, or, rotor, that, has, a, contact, arm, or, spoke, which, projects, from, its, surface, like, a, cam, it, has, an, array, of, terminals, arranged, in, a, circle, around, the, rotor, each, of, which, serves, as, a, contact, for, the, spoke, through, which, any, one, of, a, number, of, different, electrical, circuits, can, be, connected, to, the, rotor, the, switch, is, layered, to, allow, the, use, of, multiple, poles, each, layer, is, equivalent, to, one, pole, usually, such, a, switch, has, a, detent, mechanism, so, it, clicks, from, one, active, position, to, another, rather, than, stalls, in, an, intermediate, position, thus, a, rotary, switch, provides, greater, pole, and, throw, capabilities, than, simpler, switches, do, other, types, use, a, cam, mechanism, to, operate, multiple, independent, sets, of, contacts, rotary, switches, were, used, as, channel, selectors, on, television, receivers, until, the, early, 1970s, as, range, selectors, on, electrical, metering, equipment, as, band, selectors, on, multi, band, radios, and, other, similar, purposes, in, industry, rotary, switches, are, used, for, control, of, measuring, instruments, switchgear, or, in, control, circuits, for, example, a, radio, controlled, overhead, crane, may, have, a, large, multi, circuit, rotary, switch, to, transfer, hard, wired, control, signals, from, the, local, manual, controls, in, the, cab, to, the, outputs, of, the, remote, control, receiver, a, toggle, switch, or, tumbler, switch, is, a, class, of, electrical, switches, that, are, manually, actuated, by, a, mechanical, lever, handle, or, rocking, mechanism, toggle, switches, are, available, in, many, different, styles, and, sizes, and, are, used, in, numerous, applications, many, are, designed, to, provide, the, simultaneous, actuation, of, multiple, sets, of, electrical, contacts, or, the, control, of, large, amounts, of, electric, current, or, mains, voltages, the, word, toggle, is, a, reference, to, a, kind, of, mechanism, or, joint, consisting, of, two, arms, which, are, almost, in, line, with, each, other, connected, with, an, elbow, like, pivot, however, the, phrase, toggle, switch, is, applied, to, a, switch, with, a, short, handle, and, a, positive, snap, action, whether, it, actually, contains, a, toggle, mechanism, or, not, similarly, a, switch, where, a, definitive, click, is, heard, is, called, a, positive, on, off, switch, a, very, common, use, of, this, type, of, switch, is, to, switch, lights, or, other, electrical, equipment, on, or, off, multiple, toggle, switches, may, be, mechanically, interlocked, to, prevent, forbidden, combinations, in, some, contexts, particularly, computing, a, toggle, switch, or, the, action, of, toggling, is, understood, in, the, different, sense, of, a, mechanical, or, software, switch, that, alternates, between, two, states, each, time, it, is, activated, regardless, of, mechanical, construction, for, example, the, caps, lock, key, on, a, computer, causes, all, letters, to, be, generated, in, capitals, after, it, is, pressed, once, pressing, it, again, reverts, to, lower, case, letters, switches, can, be, designed, to, respond, to, any, type, of, mechanical, stimulus, for, example, vibration, the, trembler, switch, tilt, air, pressure, fluid, level, a, float, switch, the, turning, of, a, key, key, switch, linear, or, rotary, movement, a, limit, switch, or, microswitch, or, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, the, reed, switch, many, switches, are, operated, automatically, by, changes, in, some, environmental, condition, or, by, motion, of, machinery, a, limit, switch, is, used, for, example, in, machine, tools, to, interlock, operation, with, the, proper, position, of, tools, in, heating, or, cooling, systems, a, sail, switch, ensures, that, air, flow, is, adequate, in, a, duct, pressure, switches, respond, to, fluid, pressure, the, mercury, switch, consists, of, a, drop, of, mercury, inside, a, glass, bulb, with, two, or, more, contacts, the, two, contacts, pass, through, the, glass, and, are, connected, by, the, mercury, when, the, bulb, is, tilted, to, make, the, mercury, roll, on, to, them, this, type, of, switch, performs, much, better, than, the, ball, tilt, switch, as, the, liquid, metal, connection, is, unaffected, by, dirt, debris, and, oxidation, it, wets, the, contacts, ensuring, a, very, low, resistance, bounce, free, connection, and, movement, and, vibration, do, not, produce, a, poor, contact, these, types, can, be, used, for, precision, works, it, can, also, be, used, where, arcing, is, dangerous, such, as, in, the, presence, of, explosive, vapour, as, the, entire, unit, is, sealed, knife, switches, consist, of, a, flat, metal, blade, hinged, at, one, end, with, an, insulating, handle, for, operation, and, a, fixed, contact, when, the, switch, is, closed, current, flows, through, the, hinged, pivot, and, blade, and, through, the, fixed, contact, such, switches, are, usually, not, enclosed, the, knife, and, contacts, are, typically, formed, of, copper, steel, or, brass, depending, on, the, application, fixed, contacts, may, be, backed, up, with, a, spring, several, parallel, blades, can, be, operated, at, the, same, time, by, one, handle, the, parts, may, be, mounted, on, an, insulating, base, with, terminals, for, wiring, or, may, be, directly, bolted, to, an, insulated, switch, board, in, a, large, assembly, since, the, electrical, contacts, are, exposed, the, switch, is, used, only, where, people, cannot, accidentally, come, in, contact, with, the, switch, or, where, the, voltage, is, so, low, as, to, not, present, a, hazard, knife, switches, are, made, in, many, sizes, from, miniature, switches, to, large, devices, used, to, carry, thousands, of, amperes, in, electrical, transmission, and, distribution, gang, operated, switches, are, used, in, circuits, up, to, the, highest, voltages, the, disadvantages, of, the, knife, switch, are, the, slow, opening, speed, and, the, proximity, of, the, operator, to, exposed, live, parts, metal, enclosed, safety, disconnect, switches, are, used, for, isolation, of, circuits, in, industrial, power, distribution, sometimes, spring, loaded, auxiliary, blades, are, fitted, which, momentarily, carry, the, full, current, during, opening, then, quickly, part, to, rapidly, extinguish, the, arc, a, dpdt, switch, has, six, connections, but, since, polarity, reversal, is, a, very, common, usage, of, dpdt, switches, some, variations, of, the, dpdt, switch, are, internally, wired, specifically, for, polarity, reversal, these, crossover, switches, only, have, four, terminals, rather, than, six, two, of, the, terminals, are, inputs, and, two, are, outputs, when, connected, to, a, battery, or, other, dc, source, the, 4, way, switch, selects, from, either, normal, or, reversed, polarity, such, switches, can, also, be, used, as, intermediate, switches, in, a, multiway, switching, system, for, control, of, lamps, by, more, than, two, switches, in, building, wiring, light, switches, are, installed, at, convenient, locations, to, control, lighting, and, occasionally, other, circuits, by, use, of, multiple, pole, switches, multiway, switching, control, of, a, lamp, can, be, obtained, from, two, or, more, places, such, as, the, ends, of, a, corridor, or, stairwell, a, wireless, light, switch, allows, remote, control, of, lamps, for, convenience, some, lamps, include, a, touch, switch, which, electronically, controls, the, lamp, if, touched, anywhere, in, public, buildings, several, types, of, vandal, resistant, switches, are, used, to, prevent, unauthorized, use, slide, switches, are, mechanical, switches, using, a, slider, that, moves, slides, from, the, open, off, position, to, the, closed, on, position, the, term, switch, has, since, spread, to, a, variety, of, solid, state, electronics, that, perform, a, switching, function, but, which, are, controlled, electronically, by, active, devices, rather, than, purely, mechanically, these, are, categorized, in, the, article, electronic, switch, electromechanical, switches, such, as, the, traditional, relay, electromechanical, crossbar, and, strowger, switch, bridge, the, categorization
