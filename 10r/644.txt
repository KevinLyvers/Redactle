yarn, is, a, long, continuous, length, of, interlocked, fibres, used, in, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, ropemaking, and, the, production, of, textiles, thread, is, a, type, of, yarn, intended, for, sewing, by, hand, or, machine, modern, manufactured, sewing, threads, may, be, finished, with, wax, or, other, lubricants, to, withstand, the, stresses, involved, in, sewing, embroidery, threads, are, yarns, specifically, designed, for, needlework, yarn, can, be, made, of, a, number, of, natural, or, synthetic, materials, and, comes, in, a, variety, of, colors, and, thicknesses, referred, to, as, weights, although, yarn, may, be, dyed, different, colours, most, yarns, are, solid, coloured, with, a, uniform, hue, the, word, yarn, comes, from, middle, english, from, the, old, english, gearn, akin, to, old, high, german, garn, yarn, dutch, garen, ancient, greek, string, and, sanskrit, hira, band, the, human, production, of, yarn, is, known, to, have, existed, since, the, stone, age, and, earlier, prehistory, with, ancient, fiber, materials, developing, from, animal, hides, to, reeds, to, early, fabrics, cotton, wool, and, silk, were, the, first, materials, for, yarn, and, textile, trade, contributed, immensely, to, the, ancient, global, economy, in, 2011, the, bangladesh, university, of, textiles, established, a, specialized, department, of, yarn, engineering, focusing, on, the, advanced, techniques, of, transforming, textile, fibers, into, yarn, yarn, can, be, made, from, a, number, of, natural, or, synthetic, fibers, or, a, blend, of, natural, and, synthetic, fibers, the, most, common, plant, fiber, is, cotton, which, is, typically, spun, into, fine, yarn, for, mechanical, weaving, or, knitting, into, cloth, silk, is, a, natural, protein, fiber, some, forms, of, which, can, be, woven, into, textiles, the, protein, fiber, of, silk, is, composed, mainly, of, fibroin, and, is, produced, by, the, larvae, of, the, moth, bombyx, mori, silk, production, is, thought, to, have, begun, in, china, and, silk, thread, and, cloth, manufacture, was, well, established, by, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, 1050, bce, linen, is, another, natural, fiber, with, a, long, history, of, use, for, yarn, and, textiles, linen, fibers, are, derived, from, the, flax, plant, other, plant, fibers, which, can, be, spun, include, bamboo, hemp, maize, nettle, and, soy, fiber, the, most, common, spun, animal, fiber, is, wool, harvested, from, sheep, as, long, fibers, make, better, yarn, sheep, have, been, bred, over, time, to, produce, longer, fibers, this, increases, the, need, for, shearing, to, prevent, pests, and, overheating, other, animal, fibers, used, include, alpaca, angora, mohair, llama, cashmere, and, silk, more, rarely, yarn, may, be, spun, from, camel, yak, possum, musk, ox, vicu, a, cat, dog, wolf, rabbit, bison, or, chinchilla, hair, as, well, as, turkey, or, ostrich, feathers, natural, fibers, such, as, these, have, the, advantage, of, being, slightly, elastic, and, very, breathable, while, trapping, a, great, deal, of, air, making, for, some, of, the, warmest, fabrics, some, examples, of, synthetic, fibers, that, are, used, as, yarn, are, nylon, acrylic, fiber, rayon, and, polyester, synthetic, fibers, are, generally, extruded, in, continuous, strands, of, gel, state, materials, these, strands, are, drawn, stretched, annealed, hardened, and, cured, to, obtain, properties, desirable, for, later, processing, synthetic, fibers, come, in, three, basic, forms, staple, tow, and, filament, staple, is, cut, fibers, generally, sold, in, lengths, up, to, 120, mm, tow, is, a, continuous, rope, of, fibers, consisting, of, many, filaments, loosely, joined, side, to, side, filament, is, a, continuous, strand, consisting, of, anything, from, one, filament, to, many, synthetic, fiber, is, most, often, measured, in, a, weight, per, linear, measurement, basis, along, with, cut, length, denier, and, dtex, are, the, most, common, weight, to, length, measures, cut, length, only, applies, to, staple, fiber, filament, extrusion, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, spinning, but, most, people, equate, spinning, with, spun, yarn, production, t, shirt, yarn, is, a, recycled, yarn, made, from, the, same, fabric, as, is, used, in, t, shirts, and, other, clothes, it, is, often, made, from, the, remainder, fabric, of, clothing, manufacture, and, therefore, is, considered, a, recycled, and, eco, friendly, product, it, can, also, be, made, at, home, out, of, used, clothing, the, resulting, yarn, can, be, used, in, knitted, or, crocheted, items, in, general, natural, fibers, tend, to, require, more, careful, handling, than, synthetics, because, they, can, shrink, felt, stain, shed, fade, stretch, wrinkle, or, be, eaten, by, moths, more, readily, unless, special, treatments, such, as, mercerization, or, super, washing, are, performed, to, strengthen, fix, color, or, otherwise, enhance, the, fiber, s, own, properties, some, types, of, protein, yarns, i, e, hair, silk, feathers, may, feel, irritating, to, some, people, causing, contact, dermatitis, hives, or, wheezing, these, reactions, are, likely, a, sensitivity, to, thicker, and, coarser, fiber, diameter, or, fiber, ends, in, fact, contrary, to, popular, belief, wool, allergies, are, practically, unknown, according, to, a, study, reviewing, the, evidence, of, wool, as, an, allergen, conducted, by, acta, dermato, venereologica, contemporary, superfine, or, ultrafine, merino, wool, with, their, reduced, fibre, diameters, do, not, provoke, itch, are, well, tolerated, and, in, fact, benefit, eczema, management, further, studies, suggest, that, known, allergens, applied, during, textile, processing, are, minimally, present, in, wool, garments, today, given, current, industry, practices, and, are, unlikely, to, lead, to, allergic, reactions, when, natural, hair, type, fibers, are, burned, they, tend, to, singe, and, have, a, smell, of, burnt, hair, this, is, because, many, like, human, hair, are, protein, derived, cotton, and, viscose, rayon, yarns, burn, as, a, wick, synthetic, yarns, generally, tend, to, melt, though, some, synthetics, are, inherently, flame, retardant, noting, how, an, unidentified, fiber, strand, burns, and, smells, can, assist, in, determining, if, it, is, natural, or, synthetic, and, what, the, fiber, content, is, both, synthetic, and, natural, yarns, can, pill, pilling, is, a, function, of, fiber, content, spinning, method, twist, contiguous, staple, length, and, fabric, construction, single, ply, yarns, or, using, fibers, like, merino, wool, are, known, to, pill, more, due, to, the, fact, that, in, the, former, the, single, ply, is, not, tight, enough, to, securely, retain, all, the, fibers, under, abrasion, and, the, merino, wool, s, short, staple, length, allows, the, ends, of, the, fibers, to, pop, out, of, the, twist, more, easily, yarns, combining, synthetic, and, natural, fibers, inherit, the, properties, of, each, parent, according, to, the, proportional, composition, synthetics, are, added, to, lower, cost, increase, durability, add, unusual, color, or, visual, effects, provide, machine, washability, and, stain, resistance, reduce, heat, retention, or, lighten, garment, weight, spun, yarn, is, made, by, twisting, staple, fibres, together, to, make, a, cohesive, thread, or, single, twisting, fibres, into, yarn, in, the, process, called, spinning, can, be, dated, back, to, the, upper, paleolithic, and, yarn, spinning, was, one, of, the, first, processes, to, be, industrialized, spun, yarns, are, produced, by, placing, a, series, of, individual, fibres, or, filaments, together, to, form, a, continuous, assembly, of, overlapping, fibres, usually, bound, together, by, twist, spun, yarns, may, contain, a, single, type, of, fibre, or, be, a, blend, of, various, types, combining, synthetic, fibres, which, can, have, high, strength, lustre, and, fire, retardant, qualities, with, natural, fibres, which, have, good, water, absorbency, and, skin, comforting, qualities, is, very, common, the, most, widely, used, blends, are, cotton, polyester, and, wool, acrylic, fibre, blends, blends, of, different, natural, fibres, are, common, too, especially, with, more, expensive, fibres, such, as, alpaca, angora, and, cashmere, yarn, is, selected, for, different, textiles, based, on, the, characteristics, of, the, yarn, fibres, such, as, warmth, wool, light, weight, cotton, or, rayon, durability, nylon, is, added, to, sock, yarn, for, example, or, softness, cashmere, alpaca, yarn, is, composed, of, twisted, strands, of, fiber, which, are, known, as, plies, when, grouped, together, these, strands, of, yarn, are, twisted, together, plied, in, the, opposite, direction, to, make, a, thicker, yarn, depending, on, the, direction, of, this, final, twist, the, yarn, will, have, either, s, twist, the, threads, appear, to, go, up, to, the, left, or, z, twist, to, the, right, for, a, single, ply, yarn, the, direction, of, the, final, twist, is, the, same, as, its, original, twist, the, twist, direction, of, yarn, can, affect, the, final, properties, of, the, fabric, and, combined, use, of, the, two, twist, directions, can, nullify, skewing, in, knitted, fabric, the, mechanical, integrity, of, yarn, is, derived, from, frictional, contacts, between, its, composing, fibers, the, science, behind, this, was, first, studied, by, galileo, combed, yarns, are, produced, by, adding, another, step, of, yarn, spinning, namely, combing, which, aligns, the, fibres, and, removes, the, short, fibres, carried, over, from, the, previous, step, of, carding, combed, yarn, results, in, superior, quality, fabrics, in, comparison, to, carded, yarns, this, particular, yarn, is, slightly, more, expensive, because, the, weaving, is, a, long, consuming, process, combining, separates, small, fibres, from, elongated, fibres, in, which, this, procedure, makes, the, yarn, softer, and, smoother, hosiery, yarns, are, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, knitted, fabrics, since, the, knitted, materials, are, more, delicate, than, woven, materials, hence, hosiery, yarns, are, made, softer, with, fewer, twists, per, inch, than, their, woven, counterparts, hosiery, yarn, comes, from, a, separate, spinning, process, melt, spinning, and, is, used, with, circular, knitting, machines, to, form, fabric, open, end, yarn, is, produced, by, open, end, spinning, without, a, spindle, the, method, of, spinning, is, different, from, ring, spinning, in, open, end, yarn, there, is, no, roving, frame, stage, sliver, from, the, card, goes, into, the, rotor, is, spun, into, yarn, directly, open, end, yarn, can, be, produced, from, short, fibers, open, end, yarns, are, different, from, ring, yarns, open, end, yarns, are, limited, to, coarser, counts, novelty, yarns, or, complex, yarns, are, yarns, with, special, fancy, effects, introduced, during, spinning, or, plying, one, example, is, slub, yarns, yarn, with, thick, or, thin, sections, alternating, regularly, or, irregularly, in, a, similar, manner, creating, deliberate, unevenness, additions, or, injections, of, neps, or, metallic, or, synthetic, fibers, along, with, natural, fibers, in, spinning, creates, novelty, yarns, filament, yarn, consists, of, filament, fibres, very, long, continuous, fibres, either, twisted, together, or, only, grouped, together, thicker, monofilaments, are, typically, used, for, industrial, purposes, rather, than, fabric, production, or, decoration, silk, is, a, natural, filament, and, synthetic, filament, yarns, are, used, to, produce, silk, like, effects, texturized, yarns, are, made, by, a, process, of, air, texturizing, filament, yarns, sometimes, referred, to, as, taslanizing, which, combines, multiple, filament, yarns, into, a, yarn, with, some, of, the, characteristics, of, spun, yarns, they, are, synthetic, continuous, filaments, that, are, modified, to, impart, special, texture, and, appearance, it, was, originally, applied, to, synthetic, fibers, to, reduce, transparency, slipperiness, and, increase, warmth, absorbency, and, makes, the, yarn, more, opaque, it, was, used, to, manufacture, a, variety, of, textile, products, knitted, underwear, and, outer, wear, shape, retaining, knitted, suits, overcoats, they, also, were, used, in, the, production, of, artificial, fur, carpets, blankets, etc, yarn, may, be, used, undyed, or, may, be, coloured, with, natural, or, artificial, dyes, most, yarns, have, a, single, uniform, hue, but, there, is, also, a, wide, selection, of, variegated, yarns, yarn, quantities, for, handcrafts, are, usually, measured, and, sold, by, weight, in, ounces, oz, or, grams, g, common, sizes, include, 25g, 50g, and, 100g, skeins, some, companies, also, primarily, measure, in, ounces, with, common, sizes, being, three, ounce, four, ounce, six, ounce, and, eight, ounce, skeins, textile, measurements, are, taken, at, a, standard, temperature, and, humidity, because, variations, in, heat, and, humidity, can, cause, fibers, to, absorb, different, amounts, of, moisture, from, the, air, thus, increasing, the, measured, weight, of, the, yarn, without, adding, any, fiber, material, the, actual, length, of, the, yarn, contained, in, a, ball, or, skein, can, vary, due, to, the, inherent, heaviness, of, the, fibre, and, the, thickness, of, the, strand, for, instance, a, 50, g, skein, of, lace, weight, mohair, may, contain, several, hundred, metres, while, a, 50, g, skein, of, bulky, wool, may, contain, only, 60, metres, craft, yarn, comes, in, several, thicknesses, or, weights, this, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, measurement, and, weight, listed, above, the, craft, yarn, council, of, america, promotes, a, standardized, industry, system, for, measuring, yarn, weight, where, weights, are, numbered, from, 0, finest, to, 7, thickest, each, weight, can, be, described, by, a, number, and, name, size, 0, yarn, is, called, lace, size, 1, is, super, fine, size, 2, is, fine, size, 3, is, light, size, 4, is, medium, size, 5, is, bulky, size, 6, is, super, bulky, and, size, 7, is, jumbo, each, weight, also, has, several, commonly, used, but, unregulated, terms, associated, with, it, however, this, naming, convention, is, more, descriptive, than, precise, fibre, artists, disagree, about, where, on, the, continuum, each, lies, and, the, precise, relationships, between, the, sizes, these, terms, include, fingering, sport, double, knit, or, dk, worsted, aran, or, heavy, worsted, bulky, super, bulky, and, roving, another, measurement, of, yarn, weight, often, used, by, weavers, is, wraps, per, inch, wpi, the, yarn, is, wrapped, snugly, around, a, ruler, and, the, number, of, wraps, that, fit, in, an, inch, are, counted, labels, on, yarn, for, handicrafts, often, include, information, on, gauge, which, can, also, help, determine, yarn, weight, gauge, known, in, the, uk, as, tension, is, a, measurement, of, how, many, stitches, and, rows, are, produced, per, inch, or, per, cm, on, a, specified, size, of, knitting, needle, or, crochet, hook, the, proposed, standardization, uses, a, four, by, four, inch, ten, by, ten, cm, knitted, stockinette, or, single, crocheted, square, with, the, resultant, number, of, stitches, across, and, rows, high, made, by, the, suggested, tools, on, the, label, to, determine, the, gauge, in, europe, textile, engineers, often, use, the, unit, tex, which, is, the, weight, in, grams, of, a, kilometre, of, yarn, or, decitex, which, is, a, finer, measurement, corresponding, to, the, weight, in, grams, of, 10, km, of, yarn, many, other, units, have, been, used, over, time, by, different, industries, there, are, many, different, ways, in, which, yarn, is, wound, including, hanks, skeins, donut, balls, cakes, and, cones, a, hank, of, yarn, is, a, looped, bundle, of, yarn, similar, to, how, wire, is, typically, sold, the, yarn, is, usually, tied, in, two, places, directly, opposite, each, other, to, keep, the, loops, together, and, to, keep, them, from, tangling, hanks, are, a, preferred, method, of, fastening, yarn, for, many, yarn, sellers, and, yarn, dyers, due, to, its, ability, to, more, widely, display, the, qualities, of, the, fiber, it, is, often, wound, using, a, swift, a, standing, contraption, that, holds, a, yarn, hank, without, obstruction, and, spins, on, a, central, axis, to, facilitate, yarn, ball, winding, there, are, two, subtypes, of, hanks, twisted, and, folded, a, twisted, hank, is, a, hank, that, has, been, twisted, into, a, rope, braid, a, folded, hank, is, a, hank, that, has, been, folded, in, half, and, wrapped, in, a, label, for, retail, purposes, skeins, are, one, of, the, most, common, types, of, yarn, ball, although, skeins, are, technically, described, as, yarn, that, has, been, wound, into, an, oblong, shape, the, word, skein, is, used, generically, to, describe, any, ball, of, yarn, many, large, scale, yarn, retailers, like, lion, brand, and, parent, companies, like, yarnspirations, sell, their, yarn, in, skeins, unlike, other, types, of, yarn, balls, a, skein, allows, you, to, access, both, ends, of, the, yarn, the, yarn, end, in, the, inside, of, the, skein, is, called, a, center, pull, one, major, complaint, of, center, pull, bullet, skeins, is, that, the, inside, yarn, end, is, not, easily, found, and, often, is, pulled, out, of, the, skein, in, a, jumble, of, tangled, yarn, called, yarn, barf, there, are, two, types, of, skeins, a, pull, skein, which, is, more, rectangular, in, shape, and, a, bullet, skein, which, is, rounder, below, are, the, images, taken, by, a, digital, usb, microscope, these, show, how, the, yarn, looks, in, different, kinds, of, clothes, when, magnified
