the, state, corporation, for, space, activities, roscosmos, russian, commonly, known, simply, as, roscosmos, russian, is, a, state, corporation, of, the, russian, federation, responsible, for, space, flights, cosmonautics, programs, and, aerospace, research, originating, from, the, soviet, space, program, founded, in, the, 1950s, roscosmos, emerged, following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, it, initially, began, as, the, russian, space, agency, which, was, established, on, 25, february, 1992, and, restructured, in, 1999, and, 2004, as, the, russian, aviation, and, space, agency, and, the, federal, space, agency, roscosmos, respectively, in, 2015, the, federal, space, agency, roscosmos, was, merged, with, the, united, rocket, and, space, corporation, a, government, corporation, to, re, nationalize, the, space, industry, of, russia, leading, to, roscosmos, in, its, current, form, roscosmos, is, headquartered, in, moscow, with, its, main, mission, control, center, in, the, nearby, city, of, korolyov, and, the, yuri, gagarin, cosmonaut, training, center, located, in, star, city, in, moscow, oblast, its, launch, facilities, include, baikonur, cosmodrome, in, kazakhstan, the, world, s, first, and, largest, spaceport, and, vostochny, cosmodrome, which, is, being, built, in, the, russian, far, east, in, amur, oblast, its, director, since, july, 2022, is, yury, borisov, as, the, main, successor, to, the, soviet, space, program, roscosmos, legacy, includes, the, world, s, first, satellite, the, first, human, spaceflight, and, the, first, space, station, salyut, its, current, activities, include, the, international, space, station, wherein, it, is, a, major, partner, on, 22, february, 2019, roscosmos, announced, the, construction, of, its, new, headquarters, in, moscow, the, national, space, centre, its, astronaut, corps, is, the, first, in, the, world, s, history, the, soviet, space, program, did, not, have, central, executive, agencies, instead, its, organizational, architecture, was, multi, centered, it, was, the, design, bureaus, and, the, council, of, designers, that, had, the, most, say, not, the, political, leadership, the, creation, of, a, central, agency, after, the, reorganization, of, the, soviet, union, into, the, russian, federation, was, therefore, a, new, development, the, russian, space, agency, was, formed, on, 25, february, 1992, by, a, decree, of, president, yeltsin, yuri, koptev, who, had, previously, worked, with, designing, mars, landers, at, npo, lavochkin, became, the, agency, s, first, director, in, the, early, years, the, agency, suffered, from, lack, of, authority, as, the, powerful, design, bureaus, fought, to, protect, their, own, spheres, of, operation, and, to, survive, for, example, the, decision, to, keep, mir, in, operation, beyond, 1999, was, not, made, by, the, agency, but, by, the, private, shareholder, board, of, the, energia, design, bureau, another, example, is, that, the, decision, to, develop, the, new, angara, rocket, was, rather, a, function, of, khrunichev, s, ability, to, attract, resources, than, a, conscious, long, term, decision, by, the, agency, the, 1990s, saw, serious, financial, problems, due, to, the, decreased, cash, flow, which, encouraged, the, space, agency, to, improvise, and, seek, other, ways, to, keep, space, programs, running, this, resulted, in, the, agency, s, leading, role, in, commercial, satellite, launches, and, space, tourism, scientific, missions, such, as, interplanetary, probes, or, astronomy, missions, during, these, years, played, a, very, small, role, and, although, the, agency, had, connections, with, the, russian, aerospace, forces, its, budget, was, not, part, of, russia, s, defense, budget, nevertheless, the, agency, managed, to, operate, the, mir, space, station, well, past, its, planned, lifespan, contributed, to, the, international, space, station, and, continued, to, fly, soyuz, and, progress, missions, in, 1994, roscosmos, renewed, the, lease, on, its, baikonur, cosmodrome, with, the, government, of, kazakhstan, on, 31, october, 2000, a, soyuz, spacecraft, lifted, off, from, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, at, 10, 53, a, m, kazakhstan, time, on, board, were, expedition, one, commander, william, m, bill, shepherd, of, nasa, and, cosmonauts, sergei, krikalev, and, yuri, gidzenko, of, roscosmos, the, trio, arrived, at, the, international, space, station, on, 2, november, marking, the, start, of, an, uninterrupted, human, presence, on, the, orbiting, laboratory, in, march, 2004, the, agency, s, director, yuri, koptev, was, replaced, by, anatoly, perminov, who, had, previously, served, as, the, first, commander, of, the, space, forces, the, russian, economy, boomed, throughout, 2005, from, high, prices, for, exports, such, as, oil, and, gas, the, outlook, for, future, funding, in, 2006, appeared, more, favorable, this, resulted, in, the, russian, duma, approving, a, budget, of, 305, billion, rubles, about, us, 11, billion, for, the, space, agency, from, january, 2006, until, 2015, with, overall, space, expenditures, in, russia, total, about, 425, billion, rubles, for, the, same, time, period, the, budget, for, 2006, was, as, high, as, 25, billion, rubles, about, us, 900, million, which, is, a, 33, increase, from, the, 2005, budget, under, the, current, 10, year, budget, approved, the, budget, of, the, space, agency, shall, increase, 5, 10, per, year, providing, the, space, agency, with, a, constant, influx, of, money, in, addition, to, the, budget, roscosmos, plans, to, have, over, 130, billion, rubles, flowing, into, its, budget, by, other, means, such, as, industry, investments, and, commercial, space, launches, it, is, around, the, time, us, based, the, planetary, society, entered, a, partnership, with, roscosmos, the, federal, space, budget, for, the, year, 2009, was, left, unchanged, despite, the, global, economic, crisis, standing, at, about, 82, billion, rubles, 2, 4, billion, in, 2011, the, government, spent, 115, billion, rubles, 3, 8, bln, in, the, national, space, programs, the, proposed, project, core, budget, for, 2013, to, be, around, 128, 3, billion, rubles, the, budget, for, the, whole, space, program, is, 169, 8, billion, rubles, 5, 6, bln, by, 2015, the, amount, of, the, budget, can, be, increased, to, 199, 2, billion, rubles, priorities, of, the, russian, space, program, include, the, new, angara, rocket, family, and, development, of, new, communications, navigation, and, remote, earth, sensing, spacecraft, the, glonass, global, navigation, satellite, system, has, for, many, years, been, one, of, the, top, priorities, and, has, been, given, its, own, budget, line, in, the, federal, space, budget, in, 2007, glonass, received, 9, 9, billion, rubles, 360, million, and, under, the, terms, of, a, directive, signed, by, prime, minister, vladimir, putin, in, 2008, an, additional, 2, 6, billion, will, be, allocated, for, its, development, due, to, international, space, station, involvements, up, to, 50, of, russia, s, space, budget, is, spent, on, the, crewed, space, program, as, of, 2009, some, observers, have, pointed, out, that, this, has, a, detrimental, effect, on, other, aspects, of, space, exploration, and, that, the, other, space, powers, spend, much, lesser, proportions, of, their, overall, budgets, on, maintaining, human, presence, in, orbit, despite, the, considerably, improved, budget, attention, of, legislative, and, executive, authorities, positive, media, coverage, and, broad, support, among, the, population, the, russian, space, program, continues, to, face, several, problems, wages, in, the, space, industry, are, low, the, average, age, of, employees, is, high, 46, years, in, 2007, and, much, of, the, equipment, is, obsolete, on, the, positive, side, many, companies, in, the, sector, have, been, able, to, profit, from, contracts, and, partnerships, with, foreign, companies, several, new, systems, such, as, new, rocket, upper, stages, have, been, developed, in, recent, years, investments, have, been, made, to, production, lines, and, companies, have, started, to, pay, more, attention, to, educating, a, new, generation, of, engineers, and, technicians, on, 29, april, 2011, perminov, was, replaced, with, vladimir, popovkin, as, the, director, of, roscosmos, the, 65, year, old, perminov, was, over, the, legal, age, for, state, officials, and, had, received, some, criticism, after, a, failed, glonass, launch, in, december, 2010, popovkin, is, a, former, commander, of, the, russian, space, forces, and, first, deputy, defense, minister, of, russia, as, a, result, of, a, series, of, reliability, problems, and, proximate, to, the, failure, of, a, july, 2013, proton, m, launch, a, major, reorganization, of, the, russian, space, industry, was, undertaken, the, united, rocket, and, space, corporation, was, formed, as, a, joint, stock, corporation, by, the, government, in, august, 2013, to, consolidate, the, russian, space, sector, deputy, prime, minister, dmitry, rogozin, said, the, failure, prone, space, sector, is, so, troubled, that, it, needs, state, supervision, to, overcome, its, problems, three, days, following, the, proton, m, launch, failure, the, russian, government, had, announced, that, extremely, harsh, measures, would, be, taken, and, spell, the, end, of, the, space, industry, as, we, know, it, information, indicated, then, that, the, government, intended, to, reorganize, in, such, a, way, as, to, preserve, and, enhance, the, roscosmos, space, agency, more, detailed, plans, released, in, october, 2013, called, for, a, re, nationalization, of, the, troubled, space, industry, with, sweeping, reforms, including, a, new, unified, command, structure, and, reducing, redundant, capabilities, acts, that, could, lead, to, tens, of, thousands, of, layoffs, according, to, rogozin, the, russian, space, sector, employs, about, 250, 000, people, while, the, united, states, needs, only, 70, 000, to, achieve, similar, results, he, said, russian, space, productivity, is, eight, times, lower, than, america, s, with, companies, duplicating, one, another, s, work, and, operating, at, about, 40, percent, efficiency, under, the, 2013, plan, roscosmos, was, to, act, as, a, federal, executive, body, and, contracting, authority, for, programs, to, be, implemented, by, the, industry, in, 2016, the, state, agency, was, dissolved, and, the, roscosmos, brand, moved, to, the, state,

2015, gonets, civilian, low, earth, orbit, communication, satellite, system, on, 2016, the, system, consists, of, 13, satellites, 12, gonets, m, and, 1, gonets, d1, in, 2018, russia, agreed, to, help, build, the, suffa, observatory, in, uzbekistan, the, observatory, was, started, in, 1991, but, stalled, after, the, fall, of, the, ussr, on, 19, july, 2014, roscosmos, launched, the, foton, m4, satellite, containing, among, other, animals, and, plants, a, group, of, five, geckos, the, five, geckos, four, females, and, one, male, were, used, as, a, part, of, the, gecko, f4, research, program, aimed, at, measuring, the, effects, of, weightlessness, on, the, lizards, ability, to, procreate, and, develop, in, the, harsh, environment, however, soon, after, the, spacecraft, exited, the, atmosphere, mission, control, lost, contact, with, the, vessel, which, led, to, an, attempt, to, reestablish, communication, that, was, only, achieved, later, in, the, mission, when, the, satellite, returned, to, earth, after, its, planned, two, month, mission, had, been, cut, short, to, 44, days, the, space, agency, researchers, reported, that, all, the, geckos, had, perished, during, the, flight, the, exact, cause, that, led, to, the, deaths, of, the, geckos, was, declared, unknown, by, the, scientific, team, in, charge, of, the, project, reports, from, the, institute, of, medical, and, biological, problems, in, russia, have, indicated, that, the, lizards, had, been, dead, for, at, least, a, week, prior, to, their, return, to, earth, a, number, of, those, connected, to, the, mission, have, theorized, that, a, failure, in, the, vessel, s, heating, system, may, have, caused, the, cold, blooded, reptiles, to, freeze, to, death, included, in, the, mission, were, a, number,
