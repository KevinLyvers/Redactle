eniac, n, i, k, electronic, numerical, integrator, and, computer, was, the, first, programmable, electronic, general, purpose, digital, computer, completed, in, 1945, other, computers, had, some, of, these, features, but, eniac, was, the, first, to, have, them, all, it, was, turing, complete, and, able, to, solve, a, large, class, of, numerical, problems, through, reprogramming, eniac, was, designed, by, john, mauchly, and, j, presper, eckert, to, calculate, artillery, firing, tables, for, the, united, states, army, s, ballistic, research, laboratory, which, later, became, a, part, of, the, army, research, laboratory, however, its, first, program, was, a, study, of, the, feasibility, of, the, thermonuclear, weapon, eniac, was, completed, in, 1945, and, first, put, to, work, for, practical, purposes, on, december, 10, 1945, eniac, was, formally, dedicated, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, on, february, 15, 1946, having, cost, 487, 000, equivalent, to, 6, 900, 000, in, 2023, and, called, a, giant, brain, by, the, press, it, had, a, speed, on, the, order, of, one, thousand, times, faster, than, that, of, electro, mechanical, machines, eniac, was, formally, accepted, by, the, u, s, army, ordnance, corps, in, july, 1946, it, was, transferred, to, aberdeen, proving, ground, in, aberdeen, maryland, in, 1947, where, it, was, in, continuous, operation, until, 1955, eniac, s, design, and, construction, was, financed, by, the, united, states, army, ordnance, corps, research, and, development, command, led, by, major, general, gladeon, m, barnes, the, total, cost, was, about, 487, 000, equivalent, to, 6, 900, 000, in, 2023, the, construction, contract, was, signed, on, june, 5, 1943, work, on, the, computer, began, in, secret, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, s, moore, school, of, electrical, engineering, the, following, month, under, the, code, name, project, px, with, john, grist, brainerd, as, principal, investigator, herman, h, goldstine, persuaded, the, army, to, fund, the, project, which, put, him, in, charge, to, oversee, it, for, them, eniac, was, designed, by, ursinus, college, physics, professor, john, mauchly, and, j, presper, eckert, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, u, s, the, team, of, design, engineers, assisting, the, development, included, robert, f, shaw, function, tables, jeffrey, chuan, chu, divider, square, rooter, thomas, kite, sharpless, master, programmer, frank, mural, master, programmer, arthur, burks, multiplier, harry, huskey, reader, printer, and, jack, davis, accumulators, significant, development, work, was, undertaken, by, the, female, mathematicians, who, handled, the, bulk, of, the, eniac, programming, jean, jennings, marlyn, wescoff, ruth, lichterman, betty, snyder, frances, bilas, and, kay, mcnulty, in, 1946, the, researchers, resigned, from, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, formed, the, eckert, mauchly, computer, corporation, eniac, was, a, large, modular, computer, composed, of, individual, panels, to, perform, different, functions, twenty, of, these, modules, were, accumulators, that, could, not, only, add, and, subtract, but, hold, a, ten, digit, decimal, number, in, memory, numbers, were, passed, between, these, units, across, several, general, purpose, buses, or, trays, as, they, were, called, in, order, to, achieve, its, high, speed, the, panels, had, to, send, and, receive, numbers, compute, save, the, answer, and, trigger, the, next, operation, all, without, any, moving, parts, key, to, its, versatility, was, the, ability, to, branch, it, could, trigger, different, operations, depending, on, the, sign, of, a, computed, result, by, the, end, of, its, operation, in, 1956, eniac, contained, 18, 000, vacuum, tubes, 7, 200, crystal, diodes, 1, 500, relays, 70, 000, resistors, 10, 000, capacitors, and, approximately, 5, 000, 000, hand, soldered, joints, it, weighed, more, than, 30, short, tons, 27, t, was, roughly, 8, ft, 2, m, tall, 3, ft, 1, m, deep, and, 100, ft, 30, m, long, occupied, 300, sq, ft, 28, m, 2, and, consumed, 150, kw, of, electricity, input, was, possible, from, an, ibm, card, reader, and, an, ibm, card, punch, was, used, for, output, these, cards, could, be, used, to, produce, printed, output, offline, using, an, ibm, accounting, machine, such, as, the, ibm, 405, while, eniac, had, no, system, to, store, memory, in, its, inception, these, punch, cards, could, be, used, for, external, memory, storage, in, 1953, a, 100, word, magnetic, core, memory, built, by, the, burroughs, corporation, was, added, to, eniac, eniac, used, ten, position, ring, counters, to, store, digits, each, digit, required, 36, vacuum, tubes, 10, of, which, were, the, dual, triodes, making, up, the, flip, flops, of, the, ring, counter, arithmetic, was, performed, by, counting, pulses, with, the, ring, counters, and, generating, carry, pulses, if, the, counter, wrapped, around, the, idea, being, to, electronically, emulate, the, operation, of, the, digit, wheels, of, a, mechanical, adding, machine, eniac, had, 20, ten, digit, signed, accumulators, which, used, ten, s, complement, representation, and, could, perform, 5, 000, simple, addition, or, subtraction, operations, between, any, of, them, and, a, source, e, g, another, accumulator, or, a, constant, transmitter, per, second, it, was, possible, to, connect, several, accumulators, to, run, simultaneously, so, the, peak, speed, of, operation, was, potentially, much, higher, due, to, parallel, operation, it, was, possible, to, wire, the, carry, of, one, accumulator, into, another, accumulator, to, perform, arithmetic, with, double, the, precision, but, the, accumulator, carry, circuit, timing, prevented, the, wiring, of, three, or, more, for, even, higher, precision, eniac, used, four, of, the, accumulators, controlled, by, a, special, multiplier, unit, to, perform, up, to, 385, multiplication, operations, per, second, five, of, the, accumulators, were, controlled, by, a, special, divider, square, rooter, unit, to, perform, up, to, 40, division, operations, per, second, or, three, square, root, operations, per, second, the, other, nine, units, in, eniac, were, the, initiating, unit, started, and, stopped, the, machine, the, cycling, unit, used, for, synchronizing, the, other, units, the, master, programmer, controlled, loop, sequencing, the, reader, controlled, an, ibm, punch, card, reader, the, printer, controlled, an, ibm, card, punch, the, constant, transmitter, and, three, function, tables, the, references, by, rojas, and, hashagen, or, wilkes, give, more, details, about, the, times, for, operations, which, differ, somewhat, from, those, stated, above, the, basic, machine, cycle, was, 200, microseconds, 20, cycles, of, the, 100, khz, clock, in, the, cycling, unit, or, 5, 000, cycles, per, second, for, operations, on, the, 10, digit, numbers, in, one, of, these, cycles, eniac, could, write, a, number, to, a, register, read, a, number, from, a, register, or, add, subtract, two, numbers, a, multiplication, of, a, 10, digit, number, by, a, d, digit, number, for, d, up, to, 10, took, d, 4, cycles, so, the, multiplication, of, a, 10, digit, number, by, 10, digit, number, took, 14, cycles, or, 2, 800, microseconds, a, rate, of, 357, per, second, if, one, of, the, numbers, had, fewer, than, 10, digits, the, operation, was, faster, division, and, square, roots, took, 13, d, 1, cycles, where, d, is, the, number, of, digits, in, the, result, quotient, or, square, root, so, a, division, or, square, root, took, up, to, 143, cycles, or, 28, 600, microseconds, a, rate, of, 35, per, second, wilkes, 1956, 20, states, that, a, division, with, a, 10, digit, quotient, required, 6, milliseconds, if, the, result, had, fewer, than, ten, digits, it, was, obtained, faster, eniac, is, able, to, process, about, 500, flops, compared, to, modern, supercomputers, petascale, and, exascale, computing, power, eniac, used, common, octal, base, radio, tubes, of, the, day, the, decimal, accumulators, were, made, of, 6sn7, flip, flops, while, 6l7s, 6sj7s, 6sa7s, and, 6ac7s, were, used, in, logic, functions, numerous, 6l6s, and, 6v6s, served, as, line, drivers, to, drive, pulses, through, cables, between, rack, assemblies, several, tubes, burned, out, almost, every, day, leaving, eniac, nonfunctional, about, half, the, time, special, high, reliability, tubes, were, not, available, until, 1948, most, of, these, failures, however, occurred, during, the, warm, up, and, cool, down, periods, when, the, tube, heaters, and, cathodes, were, under, the, most, thermal, stress, engineers, reduced, eniac, s, tube, failures, to, the, more, acceptable, rate, of, one, tube, every, two, days, according, to, an, interview, in, 1989, with, eckert, we, had, a, tube, fail, about, every, two, days, and, we, could, locate, the, problem, within, 15, minutes, in, 1954, the, longest, continuous, period, of, operation, without, a, failure, was, 116, hours, close, to, five, days, eniac, could, be, programmed, to, perform, complex, sequences, of, operations, including, loops, branches, and, subroutines, however, instead, of, the, stored, program, computers, that, exist, today, eniac, was, just, a, large, collection, of, arithmetic, machines, which, originally, had, programs, set, up, into, the, machine, by, a, combination, of, plugboard, wiring, and, three, portable, function, tables, containing, 1, 200, ten, way, switches, each, the, task, of, taking, a, problem, and, mapping, it, onto, the, machine, was, complex, and, usually, took, weeks, due, to, the, complexity, of, mapping, programs, onto, the, machine, programs, were, only, changed, after, huge, numbers, of, tests, of, the, current, program, after, the, program, was, figured, out, on, paper, the, process, of, getting, the, program, into, eniac, by, manipulating, its, switches, and, cables, could, take, days, this, was, followed, by, a, period, of, verification, and, debugging, aided, by, the, ability, to, execute, the, program, step, by, step, a, programming, tutorial, for, the, modulo, function, using, an, eniac, simulator, gives, an, impression, of, what, a, program, on, the, eniac, looked, like, eniac, s, six, primary, programmers, kay, mcnulty, betty, jennings, betty, snyder, marlyn, wescoff, fran, bilas, and, ruth, lichterman, not, only, determined, how, to, input, eniac, programs, but, also, developed, an, understanding, of, eniac, s, inner, workings, the, programmers, were, often, able, to, narrow, bugs, down, to, an, individual, failed, tube, which, could, be, pointed, to, for, replacement, by, a, technician, during, world, war, ii, while, the, u, s, army, needed, to, compute, ballistics, trajectories, many, women, were, interviewed, for, this, task, at, least, 200, women, were, hired, by, the, moore, school, of, engineering, to, work, as, computers, and, six, of, them, were, chosen, to, be, the, programmers, of, eniac, betty, holberton, kay, mcnulty, marlyn, wescoff, ruth, lichterman, betty, jean, jennings, and, fran, bilas, programmed, the, eniac, to, perform, calculations, for, ballistics, trajectories, electronically, for, the, army, s, ballistic, research, laboratory, while, men, having, the, same, education, and, experience, were, designated, as, professionals, these, women, were, unreasonably, designated, as, subprofessionals, though, they, had, professional, degrees, in, mathematics, and, were, highly, trained, mathematicians, these, women, were, not, refrigerator, ladies, i, e, models, posing, in, front, of, the, machine, for, press, photography, as, then, computer, scientist, undergrad, kathryn, kleiman, discovered, in, her, own, research, as, opposed, to, what, she, was, told, by, a, historian, in, computing, however, some, of, the, women, did, not, receive, recognition, for, their, work, on, the, eniac, in, their, entire, lifetimes, after, the, war, ended, the, women, continued, to, work, on, the, eniac, their, expertise, made, their, positions, difficult, to, replace, with, returning, soldiers, later, in, the, 1990s, kleiman, learned, that, most, of, the, eniac, programmers, were, not, invited, to, the, eniac, s, 50th, anniversary, event, so, she, made, it, her, mission, to, track, them, down, and, record, their, oral, histories, the, documentary, intended, to, inspire, young, women, and, men, to, get, involved, in, programming, they, were, shocked, to, be, discovered, kleiman, says, they, were, thrilled, to, be, recognized, but, had, mixed, impressions, about, how, they, felt, about, being, ignored, for, so, long, kleiman, released, a, book, on, the, six, female, eniac, programmers, in, 2022, these, early, programmers, were, drawn, from, a, group, of, about, two, hundred, women, employed, as, computers, at, the, moore, school, of, electrical, engineering, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, the, job, of, computers, was, to, produce, the, numeric, result, of, mathematical, formulas, needed, for, a, scientific, study, or, an, engineering, project, they, usually, did, so, with, a, mechanical, calculator, the, women, studied, the, machine, s, logic, physical, structure, operation, and, circuitry, in, order, to, not, only, understand, the, mathematics, of, computing, but, also, the, machine, itself, this, was, one, of, the, few, technical, job, categories, available, to, women, at, that, time, betty, holberton, n, e, snyder, continued, on, to, help, write, the, first, generative, programming, system, sort, merge, and, help, design, the, first, commercial, electronic, computers, the, univac, and, the, binac, alongside, jean, jennings, mcnulty, developed, the, use, of, subroutines, in, order, to, help, increase, eniac, s, computational, capability, herman, goldstine, selected, the, programmers, whom, he, called, operators, from, the, computers, who, had, been, calculating, ballistics, tables, with, mechanical, desk, calculators, and, a, differential, analyzer, prior, to, and, during, the, development, of, eniac, under, herman, and, adele, goldstine, s, direction, the, computers, studied, eniac, s, blueprints, and, physical, structure, to, determine, how, to, manipulate, its, switches, and, cables, as, programming, languages, did, not, yet, exist, though, contemporaries, considered, programming, a, clerical, task, and, did, not, publicly, recognize, the, programmers, effect, on, the, successful, operation, and, announcement, of, eniac, mcnulty, jennings, snyder, wescoff, bilas, and, lichterman, have, since, been, recognized, for, their, contributions, to, computing, three, of, the, current, 2020, army, supercomputers, jean, kay, and, betty, are, named, after, jean, bartik, betty, jennings, kay, mcnulty, and, betty, snyder, respectively, the, programmer, and, operator, job, titles, were, not, originally, considered, professions, suitable, for, women, the, labor, shortage, created, by, world, war, ii, helped, enable, the, entry, of, women, into, the, field, however, the, field, was, not, viewed, as, prestigious, and, bringing, in, women, was, viewed, as, a, way, to, free, men, up, for, more, skilled, labor, essentially, women, were, seen, as, meeting, a, need, in, a, temporary, crisis, for, example, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, said, in, 1942, it, is, felt, that, enough, greater, return, is, obtained, by, freeing, the, engineers, from, calculating, detail, to, overcome, any, increased, expenses, in, the, computers, salaries, the, engineers, admit, themselves, that, the, girl, computers, do, the, work, more, rapidly, and, accurately, than, they, would, this, is, due, in, large, measure, to, the, feeling, among, the, engineers, that, their, college, and, industrial, experience, is, being, wasted, and, thwarted, by, mere, repetitive, calculation, following, the, initial, six, programmers, an, expanded, team, of, a, hundred, scientists, was, recruited, to, continue, work, on, the, eniac, among, these, were, several, women, including, gloria, ruth, gordon, adele, goldstine, wrote, the, original, technical, description, of, the, eniac, several, language, systems, were, developed, to, describe, programs, for, the, eniac, including, although, the, ballistic, research, laboratory, was, the, sponsor, of, eniac, one, year, into, this, three, year, project, john, von, neumann, a, mathematician, working, on, the, hydrogen, bomb, at, los, alamos, national, laboratory, became, aware, of, the, eniac, in, december, 1945, the, eniac, was, used, to, calculate, thermonuclear, reactions, using, equations, the, data, was, used, to, support, research, on, building, a, hydrogen, bomb, related, to, eniac, s, role, in, the, hydrogen, bomb, was, its, role, in, the, monte, carlo, method, becoming, popular, scientists, involved, in, the, original, nuclear, bomb, development, used, massive, groups, of, people, doing, huge, numbers, of, calculations, computers, in, the, terminology, of, the, time, to, investigate, the, distance, that, neutrons, would, likely, travel, through, various, materials, john, von, neumann, and, stanislaw, ulam, realized, the, speed, of, eniac, would, allow, these, calculations, to, be, done, much, more, quickly, the, success, of, this, project, showed, the, value, of, monte, carlo, methods, in, science, a, press, conference, was, held, on, february, 1, 1946, and, the, completed, machine, was, announced, to, the, public, the, evening, of, february, 14, 1946, featuring, demonstrations, of, its, capabilities, elizabeth, snyder, and, betty, jean, jennings, were, responsible, for, developing, the, demonstration, trajectory, program, although, herman, and, adele, goldstine, took, credit, for, it, the, machine, was, formally, dedicated, the, next, day, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, none, of, the, women, involved, in, programming, the, machine, or, creating, the, demonstration, were, invited, to, the, formal, dedication, nor, to, the, celebratory, dinner, held, afterwards, the, original, contract, amount, was, 61, 700, the, final, cost, was, almost, 500, 000, approximately, equivalent, to, 9, 000, 000, in, 2023, it, was, formally, accepted, by, the, u, s, army, ordnance, corps, in, july, 1946, eniac, was, shut, down, on, november, 9, 1946, for, a, refurbishment, and, a, memory, upgrade, and, was, transferred, to, aberdeen, proving, ground, maryland, in, 1947, there, on, july, 29, 1947, it, was, turned, on, and, was, in, continuous, operation, until, 11, 45, p, m, on, october, 2, 1955, when, it, was, retired, in, favor, of, the, more, efficient, edvac, and, ordvac, computers, a, few, months, after, eniac, s, unveiling, in, the, summer, of, 1946, as, part, of, an, extraordinary, effort, to, jump, start, research, in, the, field, the, pentagon, invited, the, top, people, in, electronics, and, mathematics, from, the, united, states, and, great, britain, to, a, series, of, forty, eight, lectures, given, in, philadelphia, pennsylvania, all, together, called, the, theory, and, techniques, for, design, of, digital, computers, more, often, named, the, moore, school, lectures, half, of, these, lectures, were, given, by, the, inventors, of, eniac, eniac, was, a, one, of, a, kind, design, and, was, never, repeated, the, freeze, on, design, in, 1943, meant, that, it, lacked, some, innovations, that, soon, became, well, developed, notably, the, ability, to, store, a, program, eckert, and, mauchly, started, work, on, a, new, design, to, be, later, called, the, edvac, which, would, be, both, simpler, and, more, powerful, in, particular, in, 1944, eckert, wrote, his, description, of, a, memory, unit, the, mercury, delay, line, which, would, hold, both, the, data, and, the, program, john, von, neumann, who, was, consulting, for, the, moore, school, on, the, edvac, sat, in, on, the, moore, school, meetings, at, which, the, stored, program, concept, was, elaborated, von, neumann, wrote, up, an, incomplete, set, of, notes, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, which, were, intended, to, be, used, as, an, internal, memorandum, describing, elaborating, and, couching, in, formal, logical, language, the, ideas, developed, in, the, meetings, eniac, administrator, and, security, officer, herman, goldstine, distributed, copies, of, this, first, draft, to, a, number, of, government, and, educational, institutions, spurring, widespread, interest, in, the, construction, of, a, new, generation, of, electronic, computing, machines, including, electronic, delay, storage, automatic, calculator, edsac, at, cambridge, university, england, and, seac, at, the, u, s, bureau, of, standards, a, number, of, improvements, were, made, to, eniac, after, 1947, including, a, primitive, read, only, stored, programming, mechanism, using, the, function, tables, as, program, rom, after, which, programming, was, done, by, setting, the, switches, the, idea, has, been, worked, out, in, several, variants, by, richard, clippinger, and, his, group, on, the, one, hand, and, the, goldstines, on, the, other, and, it, was, included, in, the, eniac, patent, clippinger, consulted, with, von, neumann, on, what, instruction, set, to, implement, clippinger, had, thought, of, a, three, address, architecture, while, von, neumann, proposed, a, one, address, architecture, because, it, was, simpler, to, implement, three, digits, of, one, accumulator, 6, were, used, as, the, program, counter, another, accumulator, 15, was, used, as, the, main, accumulator, a, third, accumulator, 8, was, used, as, the, address, pointer, for, reading, data, from, the, function, tables, and, most, of, the, other, accumulators, 1, 5, 7, 9, 14, 17, 19, were, used, for, data, memory, in, march, 1948, the, converter, unit, was, installed, which, made, possible, programming, through, the, reader, from, standard, ibm, cards, the, first, production, run, of, the, new, coding, techniques, on, the, monte, carlo, problem, followed, in, april, after, eniac, s, move, to, aberdeen, a, register, panel, for, memory, was, also, constructed, but, it, did, not, work, a, small, master, control, unit, to, turn, the, machine, on, and, off, was, also, added, the, programming, of, the, stored, program, for, eniac, was, done, by, betty, jennings, clippinger, adele, goldstine, and, others, it, was, first, demonstrated, as, a, stored, program, computer, in, april, 1948, running, a, program, by, adele, goldstine, for, john, von, neumann, this, modification, reduced, the, speed, of, eniac, by, a, factor, of, 6, and, eliminated, the, ability, of, parallel, computation, but, as, it, also, reduced, the, reprogramming, time, to, hours, instead, of, days, it, was, considered, well, worth, the, loss, of, performance, also, analysis, had, shown, that, due, to, differences, between, the, electronic, speed, of, computation, and, the, electromechanical, speed, of, input, output, almost, any, real, world, problem, was, completely, i, o, bound, even, without, making, use, of, the, original, machine, s, parallelism, most, computations, would, still, be, i, o, bound, even, after, the, speed, reduction, imposed, by, this, modification, early, in, 1952, a, high, speed, shifter, was, added, which, improved, the, speed, for, shifting, by, a, factor, of, five, in, july, 1953, a, 100, word, expansion, core, memory, was, added, to, the, system, using, binary, coded, decimal, excess, 3, number, representation, to, support, this, expansion, memory, eniac, was, equipped, with, a, new, function, table, selector, a, memory, address, selector, pulse, shaping, circuits, and, three, new, orders, were, added, to, the, programming, mechanism, mechanical, computing, machines, have, been, around, since, archimedes, time, see, antikythera, mechanism, but, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, are, considered, the, beginning, of, the, modern, computer, era, eniac, was, like, the, ibm, harvard, mark, i, and, the, german, z3, able, to, run, an, arbitrary, sequence, of, mathematical, operations, but, did, not, read, them, from, a, tape, like, the, british, colossus, it, was, programmed, by, plugboard, and, switches, eniac, combined, full, turing, complete, programmability, with, electronic, speed, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, abc, eniac, and, colossus, all, used, thermionic, valves, vacuum, tubes, eniac, s, registers, performed, decimal, arithmetic, rather, than, binary, arithmetic, like, the, z3, the, abc, and, colossus, like, the, colossus, eniac, required, rewiring, to, reprogram, until, april, 1948, in, june, 1948, the, manchester, baby, ran, its, first, program, and, earned, the, distinction, of, first, electronic, stored, program, computer, though, the, idea, of, a, stored, program, computer, with, combined, memory, for, program, and, data, was, conceived, during, the, development, of, eniac, it, was, not, initially, implemented, in, eniac, because, world, war, ii, priorities, required, the, machine, to, be, completed, quickly, and, eniac, s, 20, storage, locations, would, be, too, small, to, hold, data, and, programs, the, z3, and, colossus, were, developed, independently, of, each, other, and, of, the, abc, and, eniac, during, world, war, ii, work, on, the, abc, at, iowa, state, university, was, stopped, in, 1942, after, john, atanasoff, was, called, to, washington, d, c, to, do, physics, research, for, the, u, s, navy, and, it, was, subsequently, dismantled, the, z3, was, destroyed, by, the, allied, bombing, raids, of, berlin, in, 1943, as, the, ten, colossus, machines, were, part, of, the, uk, s, war, effort, their, existence, remained, secret, until, the, late, 1970s, although, knowledge, of, their, capabilities, remained, among, their, uk, staff, and, invited, americans, eniac, by, contrast, was, put, through, its, paces, for, the, press, in, 1946, and, captured, the, world, s, imagination, older, histories, of, computing, may, therefore, not, be, comprehensive, in, their, coverage, and, analysis, of, this, period, all, but, two, of, the, colossus, machines, were, dismantled, in, 1945, the, remaining, two, were, used, to, decrypt, soviet, messages, by, gchq, until, the, 1960s, the, public, demonstration, for, eniac, was, developed, by, snyder, and, jennings, who, created, a, demo, that, would, calculate, the, trajectory, of, a, missile, in, 15, seconds, a, task, that, would, have, taken, several, weeks, for, a, human, computer, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, mauchly, s, june, 1941, examination, of, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, abc, prototyped, in, 1939, by, john, atanasoff, and, clifford, berry, u, s, patent, 3, 120, 606, for, eniac, applied, for, in, 1947, and, granted, in, 1964, was, voided, by, the, 1973, decision, of, the, landmark, federal, court, case, honeywell, inc, v, sperry, rand, corp, the, decision, included, that, the, eniac, inventors, had, derived, the, subject, matter, of, the, electronic, digital, computer, from, atanasoff, gave, legal, recognition, to, atanasoff, as, the, inventor, of, the, first, electronic, digital, computer, and, put, the, invention, of, the, electronic, digital, computer, in, the, public, domain, the, main, parts, were, 40, panels, and, three, portable, function, tables, named, a, b, and, c, the, layout, of, the, panels, was, clockwise, starting, with, the, left, wall, an, ibm, card, reader, was, attached, to, constant, transmitter, panel, 3, and, an, ibm, card, punch, was, attached, to, printer, panel, 2, the, portable, function, tables, could, be, connected, to, function, table, 1, 2, and, 3, pieces, of, eniac, are, held, by, the, following, institutions, eniac, was, named, an, ieee, milestone, in, 1987, in, 1996, in, honor, of, the, eniac, s, 50th, anniversary, the, university, of, pennsylvania, sponsored, a, project, named, eniac, on, a, chip, where, a, very, small, silicon, computer, chip, measuring, 7, 44, mm, by, 5, 29, mm, was, built, with, the, same, functionality, as, eniac, although, this, 20, mhz, chip, was, many, times, faster, than, eniac, it, had, but, a, fraction, of, the, speed, of, its, contemporary, microprocessors, in, the, late, 1990s, in, 1997, the, six, women, who, did, most, of, the, programming, of, eniac, were, inducted, into, the, technology, international, hall, of, fame, the, role, of, the, eniac, programmers, is, treated, in, a, 2010, documentary, film, titled, top, secret, rosies, the, female, computers, of, wwii, by, leann, erickson, a, 2014, documentary, short, the, computers, by, kate, mcmahon, tells, of, the, story, of, the, six, programmers, this, was, the, result, of, 20, years, research, by, kathryn, kleiman, and, her, team, as, part, of, the, eniac, programmers, project, in, 2022, grand, central, publishing, released, proving, ground, by, kathy, kleiman, a, hardcover, biography, about, the, six, eniac, programmers, and, their, efforts, to, translate, block, diagrams, and, electronic, schematics, of, the, eniac, then, under, construction, into, programs, that, would, be, loaded, into, and, run, on, eniac, once, it, was, available, for, use, in, 2011, in, honor, of, the, 65th, anniversary, of, the, eniac, s, unveiling, the, city, of, philadelphia, declared, february, 15, as, eniac, day, the, eniac, celebrated, its, 70th, anniversary, on, february, 15, 2016
