a, cluster, munition, is, a, form, of, air, dropped, or, ground, launched, explosive, weapon, that, releases, or, ejects, smaller, submunitions, commonly, this, is, a, cluster, bomb, that, ejects, explosive, bomblets, that, are, designed, to, kill, personnel, and, destroy, vehicles, other, cluster, munitions, are, designed, to, destroy, runways, or, electric, power, transmission, lines, because, cluster, bombs, release, many, small, bomblets, over, a, wide, area, they, pose, risks, to, civilians, both, during, attacks, and, afterwards, unexploded, bomblets, can, kill, or, maim, civilians, and, or, unintended, targets, long, after, a, conflict, has, ended, and, are, costly, to, locate, and, remove, this, failure, rate, ranges, from, 2, percent, to, 40, percent, or, more, cluster, munitions, are, prohibited, for, those, nations, that, ratified, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, adopted, in, dublin, ireland, in, may, 2008, the, convention, entered, into, force, and, became, binding, international, law, upon, ratifying, states, on, 1, august, 2010, six, months, after, being, ratified, by, 30, states, as, of, 10, february, 2022, a, total, of, 123, states, have, joined, the, convention, as, 110, states, parties, and, 13, signatories, the, first, significantly, operationally, used, cluster, bomb, was, the, german, sd, 2, or, sprengbombe, dickwandig, 2, kg, commonly, referred, to, as, the, butterfly, bomb, it, was, used, in, world, war, ii, to, attack, both, civilian, and, military, targets, including, on, tokyo, and, kyushu, the, technology, was, developed, independently, by, the, united, states, russia, and, italy, see, thermos, bomb, the, us, used, the, 9, kilogram, 20, lb, m41, fragmentation, bomb, wired, together, in, clusters, of, 6, or, 25, with, highly, sensitive, or, proximity, fuzes, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1990s, cluster, bombs, became, standard, air, dropped, munitions, for, many, nations, in, a, wide, variety, of, types, they, have, been, produced, by, 34, countries, and, used, in, at, least, 23, artillery, shells, that, employ, similar, principles, have, existed, for, decades, they, are, typically, referred, to, as, icm, improved, conventional, munitions, shells, the, us, military, slang, terms, for, them, are, firecracker, or, popcorn, shells, for, the, many, small, explosions, they, cause, in, the, target, area, a, basic, cluster, bomb, consists, of, a, hollow, shell, and, then, two, to, more, than, 2, 000, submunitions, or, bomblets, contained, within, it, some, types, are, dispensers, that, are, designed, to, be, retained, by, the, aircraft, after, releasing, their, munitions, the, submunitions, themselves, may, be, fitted, with, small, parachute, retarders, or, streamers, to, slow, their, descent, allowing, the, aircraft, to, escape, the, blast, area, in, low, altitude, attacks, modern, cluster, bombs, and, submunition, dispensers, can, be, multiple, purpose, weapons, containing, a, combination, of, anti, armor, anti, personnel, and, anti, materiel, munitions, the, submunitions, themselves, may, also, be, multi, purpose, such, as, combining, a, shaped, charge, to, attack, armour, with, a, fragmenting, case, to, attack, infantry, material, and, light, vehicles, they, may, also, have, an, incendiary, function, since, the, 1990s, submunition, based, weapons, have, been, designed, that, deploy, smart, submunitions, using, thermal, and, visual, sensors, to, locate, and, attack, particular, targets, usually, armored, vehicles, weapons, of, this, type, include, the, us, cbu, 97, sensor, fuzed, weapon, first, used, in, combat, during, operation, iraqi, freedom, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, some, munitions, specifically, intended, for, anti, tank, use, can, be, set, to, self, destruct, if, they, reach, the, ground, without, locating, a, target, theoretically, reducing, the, risk, of, unintended, civilian, deaths, and, injuries, although, smart, submunition, weapons, are, much, more, expensive, than, standard, cluster, bombs, fewer, smart, submunitions, are, required, to, defeat, dispersed, and, mobile, targets, partly, offsetting, their, cost, because, they, are, designed, to, prevent, indiscriminate, area, effects, and, unexploded, ordnance, risks, some, smart, munitions, are, excluded, from, coverage, by, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, incendiary, cluster, bombs, are, intended, to, start, fires, just, like, conventional, incendiary, bombs, firebombs, they, contain, submunitions, of, white, phosphorus, or, napalm, and, can, be, combined, anti, personnel, and, anti, tank, submunitions, to, hamper, firefighting, efforts, in, urban, areas, they, have, been, preceded, by, the, use, of, conventional, explosive, bombs, to, fracture, the, roofs, and, walls, of, buildings, to, expose, their, flammable, contents, one, of, the, earliest, examples, is, the, so, called, molotov, bread, basket, used, by, the, soviet, union, in, the, winter, war, of, 1939, 40, incendiary, clusters, were, extensively, used, by, both, sides, in, the, strategic, bombings, of, world, war, ii, they, caused, firestorms, and, conflagrations, in, the, bombing, of, dresden, in, world, war, ii, and, the, firebombing, of, tokyo, some, modern, bomb, submunitions, deliver, a, highly, combustible, thermobaric, aerosol, that, results, in, a, high, pressure, explosion, when, ignited, anti, personnel, cluster, bombs, use, explosive, fragmentation, to, kill, troops, and, destroy, soft, unarmored, targets, along, with, incendiary, cluster, bombs, these, were, among, the, first, types, of, cluster, bombs, produced, by, nazi, germany, during, world, war, ii, they, were, used, during, the, blitz, with, delay, and, booby, trap, fusing, to, hamper, firefighting, and, other, damage, control, efforts, in, the, target, areas, they, were, also, used, with, a, contact, fuze, when, attacking, entrenchments, these, weapons, were, widely, used, during, the, vietnam, war, when, many, thousands, of, tons, of, submunitions, were, dropped, on, laos, cambodia, and, vietnam, most, anti, armor, munitions, contain, shaped, charge, warheads, to, pierce, the, armor, of, tanks, and, armored, fighting, vehicles, in, some, cases, guidance, is, used, to, increase, the, likelihood, of, successfully, hitting, a, vehicle, modern, guided, submunitions, such, as, those, found, in, the, u, s, cbu, 97, can, use, either, a, shaped, charge, or, an, explosively, formed, penetrator, unguided, shaped, charge, submunitions, are, designed, to, be, effective, against, entrenchments, that, incorporate, overhead, cover, to, simplify, supply, and, increase, battlefield, effectiveness, by, allowing, a, single, type, of, round, to, be, used, against, nearly, any, target, submunitions, that, incorporate, both, fragmentation, and, shaped, charge, effects, are, produced, an, anti, electrical, weapon, the, cbu, 94, b, was, first, used, by, the, u, s, in, the, kosovo, war, in, 1999, these, consist, of, a, tmd, tactical, munitions, dispenser, filled, with, 202, submunitions, each, submunition, contains, a, small, explosive, charge, that, disperses, 147, reels, of, fine, conductive, fiber, of, either, carbon, or, aluminum, coated, glass, their, purpose, is, to, disrupt, and, damage, electric, power, transmission, systems, by, producing, short, circuits, in, high, voltage, power, lines, and, electrical, substations, on, the, initial, attack, these, knocked, out, 70, of, the, electrical, power, supply, in, serbia, during, the, vietnam, war, the, us, used,

nobody, died, in, that, strike, on, 14, march, 2022, an, attack, with, a, tochka, u, missile, equipped, with, cluster, sub, munitions, was, reported, in, the, city, of, donetsk, hrmmu, confirmed, at, least, 15, civilian, deaths, and, 36, injured, in, this, incident, and, at, the, time, of, its, report, was, working, to, corroborate, other, alleged, casualties, and, whether, they, were, caused, by, cluster, sub, munitions, on, 7, december, 2022, it, was, revealed, that, ukraine, was, seeking, access, to, us, stockpiles, of, cluster, munitions, due, to, a, shortage, of, ammunition, for, himars, type, and, 155, mm, artillery, systems, the, us, has, stockpiled, its, cluster, munitions, and, had, been, considering, the, ukrainian, request, ukraine, claimed, it, would, give, them, an, edge, over, russian, artillery, as, well, as, preventing, depletion, of, other, us, and, western, stocks, on, 6, july, 2023, u, s, president, joe, biden, approved, the, provision, of, dpicm, cluster, munitions, to, ukraine, to, help, ukrainian, forces, with, the, ongoing, counteroffensive, to, liberate, russian, occupied, southeastern, ukraine, bypassing, u, s, law, prohibiting, the, transfer, of, cluster, munitions, with, a, failure, rate, greater, than, one, percent, the, weapon, system, could, be, used, in, both, himars, and, 155, mm, shell, projectiles, defense, department, official, laura, cooper, said, that, the, munitions, would, be, useful, especially, against, dug, in, russian, positions, on, the, battlefield, according, to, the, pentagon, ukraine, will, receive, an, improved, version, of, cluster, munitions, with, a, failure, rate, of, about, 2, percent, while, the, russian, cluster, bombs, fail, at, 40, percent, or, more, however, according, to, a, report, prepared, for, congress, experts, in, cleanup, operations, have, frequently, reported, failure, rates, of, 10, to, 30, the, failure, rate, of, cluster, munitions, used, by, ukraine, is, reportedly, as, high, as, 20, percent, paul, hannon, of, the, cluster, munition, coalition, cmc, said, the, biden, administration, s, decision, will, contribute, to, the, terrible, casualties, being, suffered, by, ukrainian, civilians, both, immediately, and, for, years, to, come, on, 10, july, cambodian, prime, minister, hun, sen, warned, ukraine, of, using, cluster, munitions, on, twitter, writing, it, would, be, the, greatest, danger, for, ukrainians, for, many, years, or, up, to, a, hundred, years, if, cluster, bombs, are, used, in, russian, occupied, areas, in, the, territory, of, ukraine, sen, further, cited, his, country, s, painful, experience, from, the, vietnam, war, that, has, killed, or, maimed, tens, of, thousands, of, cambodians, on, the, same, day, the, royal, united, services, institute, rusi, released, a, study, citing, the, use, of, cluster, munitions, from, the, vietnam, war, united, states, army, studies, from, that, war, showed, that, it, takes, approximately, 13, 6, high, explosive, shells, for, each, enemy, soldier, killed, a, shell, firing, dpicms, relied, on, average, only, 1, 7, shells, to, kill, an, enemy, soldier, rusi, used, an, example, of, a, trench, a, direct, hit, by, a, high, explosive, round, will, spread, shrapnel, within, line, of, sight, of, the, point, of, detonation, this, also, reduces, the, wear, and, tear, on, the, barrels, of, 155, mm, artillery, weapons, systems, on, 16, july, 2023, russian, president, vladimir, putin, claimed, that, russia, had, sufficient, stockpiles, of, its, own, cluster, munitions, and, threatened, to, take, reciprocal, action, if, ukraine, used, us, supplied, cluster, munitions, against, russian, forces, in, ukraine, on, 20, july, 2023, the, washington, post, reported, that, ukrainian, forces, had, begun, to, use, us, supplied, cluster, munitions, against, russian, forces, in, the, south, east, of, the, country, according, to, ukrainian, officials, while, all, weapons, are, dangerous, cluster, bombs, pose, a, particular, threat, to, civilians, for, two, reasons, they, have, a, wide, area, of, effect, and, they, consistently, leave, behind, a, large, number, of, unexploded, bomblets, the, unexploded, bomblets, can, remain, dangerous, for, decades, after, the, end, of, a, conflict, for, example, while, the, united, states, cluster, bombing, of, laos, stopped, in, 1973, cluster, bombs, and, other, unexploded, munitions, continued, to, cause, over, 100, casualties, per, year, to, laotian, civilians, as, of, 2009, cluster, munitions, are, opposed, by, many, individuals, and, hundreds, of, groups, such, as, the, red, cross, the, cluster, munition, coalition, and, the, united, nations, because, of, the, high, number, of, civilians, that, have, fallen, victim, to, the, weapon, since, february, 2005, handicap, international, called, for, cluster, munitions, to, be, prohibited, and, collected, hundreds, of, thousands, of, signatures, to, support, its, call, 98, of, 13, 306, recorded, cluster, munitions, casualties, that, are, registered, with, handicap, international, are, civilians, while, 27, are, children, the, area, affected, by, a, single, cluster, munition, known, as, its, footprint, can, be, very, large, a, single, unguided, m26, mlrs, rocket, can, effectively, cover, an, area, of, 0, 23, km, 2, 57, acres, in, us, and, most, allied, services, the, m26, has, been, replaced, by, the, m30, guided, missile, fired, from, the, mlrs, the, m30, has, greater, range, and, accuracy, but, a, smaller, area, of, coverage, because, of, the, weapon, s, broad, area, of, effect, they, have, often, been, documented, as, striking, both, civilian, and, military, objects, in, the, target, area, this, characteristic, of, the, weapon, is, particularly, problematic, for, civilians, when, cluster, munitions, are, used, in, or, near, populated, areas, as, documented, in, a, research, report, by, human, rights, watch, in, some, cases, like, the, zagreb, rocket, attack, civilians, were, deliberately, targeted, by, such, weapons, the, other, serious, problem, also, common, to, explosive, weapons, is, unexploded, ordnance, uxo, of, cluster, bomblets, left, behind, after, a, strike, these, bomblets, may, be, duds, or, in, some, cases, the, weapons, are, designed, to, detonate, at, a, later, stage, in, both, cases, the, surviving, bomblets, are, live, and, can, explode, when, handled, making, them, a, serious, threat, to, civilians, and, military, personnel, entering, the, area, in, effect, the, uxos, can, function, like, land, mines, even, though, cluster, bombs, are, designed, to, explode, prior, to, or, on, impact, there, are, always, some, individual, submunitions, that, do, not, explode, on, impact, as, of, 2000, the, us, made, mlrs, with, m26, warhead, and, m77, submunitions, which, were, supposed, to, have, a, 5, dud, rate, but, studies, have, shown, that, some, have, a, much, higher, rate, the, rate, in, acceptance, tests, prior, to, the, gulf, war, for, this, type, ranged, from, 2, to, a, high, of, 23, for, rockets, cooled, to, 25, f, 32, c, before, testing, the, m483a1, dpicm, artillery, delivered, cluster, bombs, have, a, reported, dud, rate, of, 14, in, july, 2023, the, failure, rate, of, russian, cluster, bombs, during, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, was, reported, to, be, at, 40, percent, or, more, given, that, each, cluster, bomb, can, contain, hundreds, of, bomblets, and, be, fired, in, volleys, even, a, small, failure, rate, can, lead, each, strike, to, leave, behind, hundreds, or, thousands, of, uxos, scattered, randomly, across, the, strike, area, for, example, after, the, 2006, israel, lebanon, conflict, un, experts, estimated, that, as, many, as, one, million, unexploded, bomblets, may, contaminate, the, hundreds, of, cluster, munition, strike, sites, in, lebanon, in, addition, some, cluster, bomblets, such, as, the, blu, 97, b, used, in, the, cbu, 87, are, brightly, colored, to, increase, their, visibility, and, warn, off, civilians, however, the, yellow, color, coupled, with, their, small, and, nonthreatening, appearance, is, attractive, to, young, children, who, wrongly, believe, them, to, be, toys, this, problem, was, exacerbated, in, the, war, in, afghanistan, 2001, 2021, when, us, forces, dropped, humanitarian, rations, from, airplanes, with, similar, yellow, colored, packaging, as, the, blu, 97, b, yellow, being, the, nato, standard, colour, for, high, explosive, filler, in, air, weapons, the, rations, packaging, was, later, changed, first, to, blue, and, then, to, clear, in, the, hope, of, avoiding, such, hazardous, confusion, as, of, 1993, the, us, military, was, developing, new, cluster, bombs, that, it, claimed, could, have, a, much, lower, less, than, 1, dud, rate, sensor, fused, weapons, that, contain, a, limited, number, of, submunitions, that, are, capable, of, autonomously, engaging, armored, targets, may, provide, a, viable, if, costly, alternative, to, cluster, munitions, that, will, allow, multiple, target, engagement, with, one, shell, or, bomb, while, avoiding, the, civilian, deaths, and, injuries, consistently, documented, from, the, use, of, cluster, munitions, in, the, 1980s, the, spanish, firm, esperanza, y, cia, developed, a, 120, mm, caliber, mortar, bomb, which, contained, 21, anti, armor, submunitions, what, made, the, 120, mm, espin, unique, was, the, electrical, impact, fusing, system, which, totally, eliminated, dangerous, duds, the, system, operated, on, a, capacitor, in, each, submunition, which, was, charged, by, a, wind, generator, in, the, nose, of, the, projectile, after, being, fired, if, for, whatever, reason, the, electrical, fuse, fails, to, function, on, impact, approximately, 5, minutes, later, the, capacitor, bleeds, out, therefore, neutralizing, the, submunition, s, electronic, fuse, system, countries, and, disputed, territories, listed, in, italic, that, have, been, affected, by, cluster, munitions, as, of, august, 2023, include, as, of, august, 2019, it, is, unclear, whether, colombia, and, georgia, are, contaminated, albania, the, republic, of, the, congo, grenada, guinea, bissau, mauritania, mozambique, norway, zambia, uganda, and, thailand, completed, clearance, of, areas, contaminated, by, cluster, munition, remnants, in, previous, years, cluster, bombs, fall, under, the, general, rules, of, international, humanitarian, law, but, were, not, specifically, covered, by, any, currently, binding, international, legal, instrument, until, the, signature, of, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, in, december, 2008, this, international, treaty, stemmed, from, an, initiative, by, stoltenberg, s, second, cabinet, known, as, the, oslo, process, which, was, launched, in, february, 2007, to, prohibit, cluster, munitions, more, than, 100, countries, agreed, to, the, text, of, the, resulting, convention, on, cluster, munitions, in, may, 2008, which, sets, out, a, comprehensive, ban, on, these, weapons, this, treaty, was, signed, by, 94, states, in, oslo, on, 3, 4, december, 2008, the, oslo, process, was, launched, largely, in, response, to, the, failure, of, the, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, ccw, where, five, years, of, discussions, failed, to, find, an, adequate, response, to, these, weapons, the, cluster, munition, coalition, cmc, is, campaigning, for, the, widespread, accession, to, and, ratification, of, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, a, number, of, sections, of, the, protocol, on, explosive, remnants, of, war, protocol, v, to, the, 1980, convention, 28, november, 2003, occasionally, address, some, of, the, problems, associated, with, the, use, of, cluster, munitions, in, particular, article, 9, which, mandates, states, parties, to, take, generic, preventive, measures, aimed, at, minimising, the, occurrence, of, explosive, remnants, of, war, in, june, 2006, belgium, was, the, first, country, to, issue, a, ban, on, the, use, carrying, transportation, export, stockpiling, trade, and, production, of, cluster, munitions, and, austria, followed, suit, on, 7, december, 2007, there, has, been, legislative, activity, on, cluster, munitions, in, several, countries, including, austria, australia, denmark, france, germany, luxembourg, netherlands, norway, sweden, switzerland, united, kingdom, and, united, states, in, some, of, these, countries, ongoing, discussions, concerning, draft, legislation, banning, cluster, munitions, along, the, lines, of, the, legislation, adopted, in, belgium, and, austria, will, now, turn, to, ratification, of, the, global, ban, treaty, norway, and, ireland, have, national, legislation, prohibiting, cluster, munitions, and, were, able, to, deposit, their, instruments, of, ratification, to, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, immediately, after, signing, it, in, oslo, on, 3, december, 2008, other, weapons, such, as, land, mines, have, been, banned, in, many, countries, under, specific, legal, instruments, for, several, years, notably, the, ottawa, treaty, to, ban, land, mines, and, some, of, the, protocols, in, the, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, that, also, help, clearing, the, lands, contaminated, by, left, munitions, after, the, end, of, conflicts, and, provides, international, assistance, to, the, affected, populations, however, until, the, adoption, of, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, in, dublin, in, may, 2008, cluster, bombs, were, not, banned, by, any, international, treaty, and, were, considered, legitimate, weapons, by, some, governments, to, increase, pressure, for, governments, to, come, to, an, international, treaty, on, 13, november, 2003, the, cluster, munition, coalition, cmc, was, established, with, the, goal, of, addressing, the, impact, of, cluster, munitions, on, civilians, international, governmental, deliberations, in, the, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, turned, on, the, broader, problem, of, explosive, remnants, of, war, a, problem, to, which, cluster, munitions, have, contributed, in, a, significant, way, there, were, consistent, calls, from, the, cluster, munition, coalition, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, icrc, and, a, number, of, un, agencies, joined, by, approximately, 30, governments, for, international, governmental, negotiations, to, develop, specific, measures, that, would, address, the, humanitarian, problems, cluster, munitions, pose, this, did, not, prove, possible, in, the, conventional, multilateral, forum, after, a, reversal, in, the, us, position, in, 2007, deliberations, did, begin, on, cluster, munitions, within, the, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, there, was, a, concerted, effort, led, by, the, us, to, develop, a, new, protocol, to, the, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, but, this, proposal, was, rejected, by, over, 50, states, together, with, civil, society, icrc, and, un, agencies, the, discussions, ended, with, no, result, in, november, 2011, leaving, the, 2008, convention, on, cluster, munitions, as, the, single, international, standard, on, the, weapons, in, february, 2006, belgium, announced, its, decision, to, ban, the, weapon, by, law, then, norway, announced, a, national, moratorium, in, june, and, austria, announced, its, decision, in, july, to, work, for, an, international, instrument, on, the, weapon, the, international, controversy, over, the, use, and, impact, of, cluster, munitions, during, the, war, between, lebanon, and, israel, in, july, and, august, 2006, added, weight, to, the, global, campaign, for, a, ban, treaty, a, new, flexible, multilateral, process, similar, to, the, process, that, led, to, the, ban, on, anti, personnel, land, mines, in, 1997, the, ottawa, treaty, began, with, an, announcement, in, november, 2006, in, geneva, as, well, at, the, same, time, by, the, government, of, norway, that, it, would, convene, an, international, meeting, in, early, 2007, in, oslo, to, work, towards, a, new, treaty, prohibiting, cluster, munitions, forty, nine, governments, attended, the, meeting, in, oslo, 22, 23, february, 2007, in, order, to, reaffirm, their, commitment, to, a, new, international, ban, on, the, weapon, a, follow, up, meeting, in, this, process, was, held, in, lima, in, may, where, around, 70, states, discussed, the, outline, of, a, new, treaty, hungary, became, the, latest, country, to, announce, a, moratorium, and, peru, launched, an, initiative, to, make, latin, america, a, cluster, munition, free, zone, in, addition, the, icrc, held, an, experts, meeting, on, cluster, munitions, in, april, 2007, which, helped, clarify, technical, legal, military, and, humanitarian, aspects, of, the, weapon, with, a, view, to, developing, an, international, response, further, meetings, took, place, in, vienna, on, 4, 7, december, 2007, and, in, wellington, on, 18, 22, february, 2008, where, a, declaration, in, favor, of, negotiations, on, a, draft, convention, was, adopted, by, more, than, 80, countries, in, may, 2008, after, around, 120, countries, had, subscribed, to, the, wellington, declaration, and, participated, in, the, dublin, diplomatic, conference, from, 19, to, 30, may, 2008, at, the, end, of, this, conference, 107, countries, agreed, to, adopt, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, that, bans, cluster, munitions, and, was, opened, for, signature, in, oslo, on, 3, 4, december, 2008, where, it, was, signed, by, 94, countries, in, july, 2008, united, states, defense, secretary, robert, m, gates, implemented, a, policy, to, eliminate, by, 2018, all, cluster, bombs, that, do, not, meet, new, safety, standards, in, november, 2008, ahead, of, the, signing, conference, in, oslo, the, european, parliament, passed, a, resolution, calling, on, all, european, union, governments, to, sign, and, ratify, the, convention, on, 16, february, 2010, burkina, faso, became, the, 30th, state, to, deposit, its, instrument, of, ratification, for, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, this, means, that, the, number, of, states, required, for, the, convention, to, enter, into, force, had, been, reached, the, treaty, s, obligations, became, legally, binding, on, the, 30, ratifying, states, on, 1, august, 2010, and, subsequently, for, other, ratifying, states, taking, effect, on, 1, august, 2010, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, bans, the, stockpiling, use, and, transfer, of, virtually, all, existing, cluster, bombs, and, provides, for, the, clearing, up, of, unexploded, munitions, it, had, been, signed, by, 108, countries, of, which, 38, had, ratified, it, by, the, affected, date, but, many, of, the, world, s, major, military, powers, including, the, united, states, russia, india, brazil, and, china, are, not, signatories, to, the, treaty, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, entered, into, force, on, 1, august, 2010, six, months, after, it, was, ratified, by, 30, states, as, of, 26, september, 2018, a, total, of, 120, states, had, joined, the, convention, as, 104, states, parties, and, 16, signatories, for, an, updated, list, of, countries, see, convention, on, cluster, munitions, state, parties, according, to, the, us, state, department, the, u, s, suspended, operational, use, of, cluster, munitions, in, 2003, however, amnesty, international, published, a, report, that, the, u, s, used, them, in, yemen, during, the, 2009, al, majalah, camp, attack, u, s, arguments, favoring, the, use, of, cluster, munitions, are, that, their, use, reduces, the, number, of, aircraft, and, artillery, systems, needed, to, support, military, operations, and, if, they, were, eliminated, significantly, more, money, would, have, to, be, spent, on, new, weapons, ammunition, and, logistical, resources, also, militaries, would, need, to, increase, their, use, of, massed, artillery, and, rocket, barrages, to, get, the, same, coverage, which, would, destroy, or, damage, more, key, infrastructures, the, u, s, was, initially, against, any, ccw, limitation, negotiations, but, dropped, its, opposition, in, june, 2007, cluster, munitions, have, been, determined, as, needed, for, ensuring, the, country, s, national, security, interests, but, measures, were, taken, to, address, humanitarian, concerns, of, their, use, as, well, as, pursuing, their, original, suggested, alternative, to, a, total, ban, of, pursuing, technological, fixes, to, make, the, weapons, no, longer, viable, after, the, end, of, a, conflict, in, may, 2008, then, acting, assistant, secretary, of, state, for, political, military, affairs, stephen, mull, stated, that, the, u, s, military, relies, upon, cluster, munitions, as, an, important, part, of, their, war, strategy, mull, emphasized, that, u, s, forces, simply, cannot, fight, by, design, or, by, doctrine, without, holding, out, at, least, the, possibility, of, using, cluster, munitions, the, u, s, army, ceased, procurement, of, gmlrs, cluster, rockets, in, december, 2008, because, of, a, submunition, dud, rate, as, high, as, five, percent, pentagon, policy, was, to, have, all, cluster, munitions, used, after, 2018, to, have, a, submunition, unexploded, ordnance, rate, of, less, than, one, percent, to, achieve, this, the, army, undertook, the, alternative, warhead, program, awp, to, assess, and, recommend, technologies, to, reduce, or, eliminate, cluster, munition, failures, as, some, 80, percent, of, u, s, military, cluster, weapons, reside, in, army, artillery, stockpiles, in, july, 2012, the, u, s, fired, at, a, target, area, with, 36, guided, multiple, launch, rocket, system, gmlrs, unitary, warhead, rockets, analysis, indicated, that, capability, gaps, existed, as, cluster, munitions, require, approval, by, the, combatant, commander, which, reduced, the, advantage, of, responsive, precision, fire, the, same, effect, could, have, been, made, by, four, alternative, warhead, aw, gmlrs, rockets, under, development, by, the, awp, to, engage, the, same, target, set, as, cluster, munitions, without, access, to, the, aw, the, operation, required, using, nine, times, as, many, rockets, cost, nine, times, as, much, 3, 6, million, compared, to, 400, 000, and, took, 40, times, as, long, more, than,

placed, export, moratorium, language, on, cluster, weapons, since, then, on, 19, may, 2011, the, defense, security, cooperation, agency, issued, a, memorandum, prohibiting, the, sale, of, all, but, the, cbu, 97b, cbu, 105, sensor, fuzed, weapon, because, the, others, have, been, demonstrated, to, have, a, unexploded, ordnance, rate, of, greater, than, 1, on, 30, november, 2017, the, pentagon, put, off, indefinitely, their, planned, ban, on, using, cluster, bombs, after, 2018, as, they, had, been, unable, to, produce, submunitions, with, failure, rates, of, 1, or, less, since, it, is, unclear, how, long, it, might, take, to, achieve, that, standard, a, months, long, policy, review, concluded, the, deadline, should, be, postponed, deployment, of, existing, cluster, weapons, is, left, to, commanders, discretion, to, authorize, their, use, when, deemed, necessary, until, sufficient, quantities, of, safer, versions, are, developed, and, fielded, at, least, 25, countries, have,
