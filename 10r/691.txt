rapid, transit, or, mass, rapid, transit, mrt, commonly, referred, to, as, metro, is, a, type, of, high, capacity, public, transport, that, is, generally, built, in, urban, areas, a, grade, separated, rapid, transit, line, below, ground, surface, through, a, tunnel, can, be, regionally, called, a, subway, tube, or, underground, they, are, sometimes, grade, separated, on, elevated, railways, in, which, case, some, are, referred, to, as, el, trains, short, for, elevated, or, skytrains, rapid, transit, systems, are, railways, usually, electric, that, unlike, buses, or, trams, operate, on, an, exclusive, right, of, way, which, cannot, be, accessed, by, pedestrians, or, other, vehicles, modern, services, on, rapid, transit, systems, are, provided, on, designated, lines, between, stations, typically, using, electric, multiple, units, on, railway, tracks, some, systems, use, guided, rubber, tires, magnetic, levitation, maglev, or, monorail, the, stations, typically, have, high, platforms, without, steps, inside, the, trains, requiring, custom, made, trains, in, order, to, minimize, gaps, between, train, and, platform, they, are, typically, integrated, with, other, public, transport, and, often, operated, by, the, same, public, transport, authorities, some, rapid, transit, systems, have, at, grade, intersections, between, a, rapid, transit, line, and, a, road, or, between, two, rapid, transit, lines, the, world, s, first, rapid, transit, system, was, the, partially, underground, metropolitan, railway, which, opened, in, 1863, using, steam, locomotives, and, now, forms, part, of, the, london, underground, in, 1868, new, york, opened, the, elevated, west, side, and, yonkers, patent, railway, initially, a, cable, hauled, line, using, stationary, steam, engines, as, of, 2021, china, has, the, largest, number, of, rapid, transit, systems, in, the, world, 40, in, number, running, on, over, 4, 500, km, 2, 800, mi, of, track, and, was, responsible, for, most, of, the, world, s, rapid, transit, expansion, in, the, 2010s, the, world, s, longest, single, operator, rapid, transit, system, by, route, length, is, the, shanghai, metro, the, world, s, largest, single, rapid, transit, service, provider, by, number, of, stations, 472, stations, in, total, is, the, new, york, city, subway, the, busiest, rapid, transit, systems, in, the, world, by, annual, ridership, are, the, shanghai, metro, tokyo, subway, system, seoul, metro, and, the, moscow, metro, the, term, metro, is, the, most, commonly, used, term, for, underground, rapid, transit, systems, used, by, non, native, english, speakers, rapid, transit, systems, may, be, named, after, the, medium, by, which, passengers, travel, in, busy, central, business, districts, the, use, of, tunnels, inspires, names, such, as, subway, underground, untergrundbahn, u, bahn, in, german, or, the, tunnelbana, t, bana, in, swedish, the, use, of, viaducts, inspires, names, such, as, elevated, l, or, el, skytrain, overhead, overground, or, hochbahn, in, german, one, of, these, terms, may, apply, to, an, entire, system, even, if, a, large, part, of, the, network, for, example, in, outer, suburbs, runs, at, ground, level, in, most, of, britain, a, subway, is, a, pedestrian, underpass, the, terms, underground, and, tube, are, used, for, the, london, underground, the, north, east, england, tyne, and, wear, metro, mostly, overground, is, known, as, the, metro, in, scotland, the, glasgow, subway, underground, rapid, transit, system, is, known, as, the, subway, various, terms, are, used, for, rapid, transit, systems, around, north, america, the, term, metro, is, a, shortened, reference, to, a, metropolitan, area, rapid, transit, systems, such, as, the, washington, metro, los, angeles, metro, rail, the, miami, metrorail, and, the, montreal, metro, are, generally, called, the, metro, in, philadelphia, the, term, el, is, used, for, the, market, frankford, line, which, runs, mostly, on, an, elevated, track, while, the, term, subway, applies, to, the, broad, street, line, which, is, almost, entirely, underground, chicago, s, commuter, rail, system, that, serves, the, entire, metropolitan, area, is, called, metra, short, for, met, ropolitan, ra, il, while, its, rapid, transit, system, that, serves, the, city, is, called, the, l, boston, s, subway, system, is, known, locally, as, the, t, in, the, san, francisco, bay, area, residents, refer, to, bay, area, rapid, transit, by, its, acronym, bart, the, new, york, city, subway, is, referred, to, simply, as, the, subway, despite, 40, of, the, system, running, above, ground, the, term, l, or, el, is, not, used, for, elevated, lines, in, general, as, the, lines, in, the, system, are, already, designated, with, letters, and, numbers, the, l, train, or, l, new, york, city, subway, service, refers, specifically, to, the, 14th, street, canarsie, local, line, and, not, other, elevated, trains, similarly, the, toronto, subway, is, referred, to, as, the, subway, with, some, of, its, system, also, running, above, ground, these, are, the, only, two, north, american, systems, that, are, called, subways, in, most, of, southeast, asia, and, in, taiwan, rapid, transit, systems, are, primarily, known, by, the, acronym, mrt, the, meaning, varies, from, one, country, to, another, in, indonesia, the, acronym, stands, for, moda, raya, terpadu, or, integrated, mass, mode, in, english, in, the, philippines, it, stands, for, metro, rail, transit, two, underground, lines, use, the, term, subway, in, thailand, it, stands, for, metropolitan, rapid, transit, previously, using, the, mass, rapid, transit, name, outside, of, southeast, asia, kaohsiung, and, taoyuan, taiwan, have, their, own, mrt, systems, which, stands, for, mass, rapid, transit, as, with, singapore, and, malaysia, the, opening, of, london, s, steam, hauled, metropolitan, railway, in, 1863, marked, the, beginning, of, rapid, transit, initial, experiences, with, steam, engines, despite, ventilation, were, unpleasant, experiments, with, pneumatic, railways, failed, in, their, extended, adoption, by, cities, in, 1890, the, city, south, london, railway, was, the, first, electric, traction, rapid, transit, railway, which, was, also, fully, underground, prior, to, opening, the, line, was, to, be, called, the, city, and, south, london, subway, thus, introducing, the, term, subway, into, railway, terminology, both, railways, alongside, others, were, eventually, merged, into, london, underground, the, 1893, liverpool, overhead, railway, was, designed, to, use, electric, traction, from, the, outset, the, technology, quickly, spread, to, other, cities, in, europe, the, united, states, argentina, and, canada, with, some, railways, being, converted, from, steam, and, others, being, designed, to, be, electric, from, the, outset, budapest, chicago, glasgow, boston, and, new, york, city, all, converted, or, purpose, designed, and, built, electric, rail, services, advancements, in, technology, have, allowed, new, automated, services, hybrid, solutions, have, also, evolved, such, as, tram, train, and, premetro, which, incorporate, some, of, the, features, of, rapid, transit, systems, in, response, to, cost, engineering, considerations, and, topological, challenges, some, cities, have, opted, to, construct, tram, systems, particularly, those, in, australia, where, density, in, cities, was, low, and, suburbs, tended, to, spread, out, since, the, 1970s, the, viability, of, underground, train, systems, in, australian, cities, particularly, sydney, and, melbourne, has, been, reconsidered, and, proposed, as, a, solution, to, over, capacity, melbourne, had, tunnels, and, stations, developed, in, the, 1970s, and, opened, in, 1980, the, first, line, of, the, sydney, metro, was, opened, in, 2019, since, the, 1960s, many, new, systems, have, been, introduced, in, europe, asia, and, latin, america, in, the, 21st, century, most, new, expansions, and, systems, are, located, in, asia, with, china, becoming, the, world, s, leader, in, metro, expansion, operating, some, of, the, largest, and, busiest, systems, while, possessing, almost, 60, cities, that, are, operating, constructing, or, planning, a, rapid, transit, system, rapid, transit, is, used, for, local, transport, in, cities, agglomerations, and, metropolitan, areas, to, transport, large, numbers, of, people, often, short, distances, at, high, frequency, the, extent, of, the, rapid, transit, system, varies, greatly, between, cities, with, several, transport, strategies, some, systems, may, extend, only, to, the, limits, of, the, inner, city, or, to, its, inner, ring, of, suburbs, with, trains, making, frequent, station, stops, the, outer, suburbs, may, then, be, reached, by, a, separate, commuter, rail, network, where, more, widely, spaced, stations, allow, higher, speeds, in, some, cases, the, differences, between, urban, rapid, transit, and, suburban, systems, are, not, clear, rapid, transit, systems, may, be, supplemented, by, other, systems, such, as, trolleybuses, regular, buses, trams, or, commuter, rail, this, combination, of, transit, modes, serves, to, offset, certain, limitations, of, rapid, transit, such, as, limited, stops, and, long, walking, distances, between, outside, access, points, bus, or, tram, feeder, systems, transport, people, to, rapid, transit, stops, each, rapid, transit, system, consists, of, one, or, more, lines, or, circuits, each, line, is, serviced, by, at, least, one, specific, route, with, trains, stopping, at, all, or, some, of, the, line, s, stations, most, systems, operate, several, routes, and, distinguish, them, by, colors, names, numbering, or, a, combination, thereof, some, lines, may, share, track, with, each, other, for, a, portion, of, their, route, or, operate, solely, on, their, own, right, of, way, often, a, line, running, through, the, city, center, forks, into, two, or, more, branches, in, the, suburbs, allowing, a, higher, service, frequency, in, the, center, this, arrangement, is, used, by, many, systems, such, as, the, copenhagen, metro, the, milan, metro, the, oslo, metro, the, istanbul, metro, and, the, new, york, city, subway, alternatively, there, may, be, a, single, central, terminal, often, shared, with, the, central, railway, station, or, multiple, interchange, stations, between, lines, in, the, city, center, for, instance, in, the, prague, metro, the, london, underground, and, paris, m, tro, are, densely, built, systems, with, a, matrix, of, crisscrossing, lines, throughout, the, cities, the, chicago, l, has, most, of, its, lines, converging, on, the, loop, the, main, business, financial, and, cultural, area, some, systems, have, a, circular, line, around, the, city, center, connecting, to, radially, arranged, outward, lines, such, as, the, moscow, metro, s, koltsevaya, line, and, beijing, subway, s, line, 10, the, capacity, of, a, line, is, obtained, by, multiplying, the, car, capacity, the, train, length, and, the, service, frequency, heavy, rapid, transit, trains, might, have, six, to, twelve, cars, while, lighter, systems, may, use, four, or, fewer, cars, have, a, capacity, of, 100, to, 150, passengers, varying, with, the, seated, to, standing, ratio, more, standing, gives, higher, capacity, the, minimum, time, interval, between, trains, is, shorter, for, rapid, transit, than, for, mainline, railways, owing, to, the, use, of, communications, based, train, control, the, minimum, headway, can, reach, 90, seconds, but, many, systems, typically, use, 120, seconds, to, allow, for, recovery, from, delays, typical, capacity, lines, allow, 1, 200, people, per, train, giving, 36, 000, passengers, per, hour, per, direction, however, much, higher, capacities, are, attained, in, east, asia, with, ranges, of, 75, 000, to, 85, 000, people, per, hour, achieved, by, mtr, corporation, s, urban, lines, in, hong, kong, rapid, transit, topologies, are, determined, by, a, large, number, of, factors, including, geographical, barriers, existing, or, expected, travel, patterns, construction, costs, politics, and, historical, constraints, a, transit, system, is, expected, to, serve, an, area, of, land, with, a, set, of, lines, which, consist, of, shapes, summarized, as, i, l, u, s, and, o, shapes, or, loops, geographical, barriers, may, cause, chokepoints, where, transit, lines, must, converge, for, example, to, cross, a, body, of, water, which, are, potential, congestion, sites, but, also, offer, an, opportunity, for, transfers, between, lines, ring, lines, provide, good, coverage, connect, between, the, radial, lines, and, serve, tangential, trips, that, would, otherwise, need, to, cross, the, typically, congested, core, of, the, network, a, rough, grid, pattern, can, offer, a, wide, variety, of, routes, while, still, maintaining, reasonable, speed, and, frequency, of, service, a, study, of, the, 15, world, largest, subway, systems, suggested, a, universal, shape, composed, of, a, dense, core, with, branches, radiating, from, it, rapid, transit, operators, have, often, built, up, strong, brands, often, focused, on, easy, recognition, to, allow, quick, identification, even, in, the, vast, array, of, signage, found, in, large, cities, combined, with, the, desire, to, communicate, speed, safety, and, authority, in, many, cities, there, is, a, single, corporate, image, for, the, entire, transit, authority, but, the, rapid, transit, uses, its, own, logo, that, fits, into, the, profile, a, transit, map, is, a, topological, map, or, schematic, diagram, used, to, show, the, routes, and, stations, in, a, public, transport, system, the, main, components, are, color, coded, lines, to, indicate, each, line, or, service, with, named, icons, to, indicate, stations, maps, may, show, only, rapid, transit, or, also, include, other, modes, of, public, transport, transit, maps, can, be, found, in, transit, vehicles, on, platforms, elsewhere, in, stations, and, in, printed, timetables, maps, help, users, understand, the, interconnections, between, different, parts, of, the, system, for, example, they, show, the, interchange, stations, where, passengers, can, transfer, between, lines, unlike, conventional, maps, transit, maps, are, usually, not, geographically, accurate, but, emphasize, the, topological, connections, among, the, different, stations, the, graphic, presentation, may, use, straight, lines, and, fixed, angles, and, often, a, fixed, minimum, distance, between, stations, to, simplify, the, display, of, the, transit, network, often, this, has, the, effect, of, compressing, the, distance, between, stations, in, the, outer, area, of, the, system, and, expanding, distances, between, those, close, to, the, center, some, systems, assign, unique, alphanumeric, codes, to, each, of, their, stations, to, help, commuters, identify, them, which, briefly, encodes, information, about, the, line, it, is, on, and, its, position, on, the, line, for, example, on, the, singapore, mrt, changi, airport, mrt, station, has, the, alphanumeric, code, cg2, indicating, its, position, as, the, 2nd, station, on, the, changi, airport, branch, of, the, east, west, line, interchange, stations, have, at, least, two, codes, for, example, raffles, place, mrt, station, has, two, codes, ns26, and, ew14, the, 26th, station, on, the, north, south, line, and, the, 14th, station, on, the, east, west, line, the, seoul, metro, is, another, example, that, utilizes, a, code, for, its, stations, unlike, that, of, singapore, s, mrt, it, is, mostly, numbers, based, on, the, line, number, for, example, sinyongsan, station, is, coded, as, station, 429, being, on, line, 4, the, first, number, of, the, station, code, is, 4, the, last, two, numbers, are, the, station, number, on, that, line, interchange, stations, can, have, multiple, codes, like, city, hall, station, in, seoul, which, is, served, by, line, 1, and, line, 2, it, has, a, code, of, 132, and, 201, respectively, the, line, 2, is, a, circle, line, and, the, first, stop, is, city, hall, therefore, city, hall, has, the, station, code, of, 201, for, lines, without, a, number, like, bundang, line, it, will, have, an, alphanumeric, code, lines, without, a, number, that, are, operated, by, korail, will, start, with, the, letter, k, with, widespread, use, of, the, internet, and, cell, phones, globally, transit, operators, now, use, these, technologies, to, present, information, to, their, users, in, addition, to, online, maps, and, timetables, some, transit, operators, now, offer, real, time, information, which, allows, passengers, to, know, when, the, next, vehicle, will, arrive, and, expected, travel, times, the, standardized, gtfs, data, format, for, transit, information, allows, many, third, party, software, developers, to, produce, web, and, smartphone, app, programs, which, give, passengers, customized, updates, regarding, specific, transit, lines, and, stations, of, interest, mexico, city, metro, uses, a, unique, pictogram, for, each, station, originally, intended, to, help, make, the, network, map, readable, by, illiterate, people, this, system, has, since, become, an, icon, of, the, system, compared, to, other, modes, of, transport, rapid, transit, has, a, good, safety, record, with, few, accidents, rail, transport, is, subject, to, strict, safety, regulations, with, requirements, for, procedure, and, maintenance, to, minimize, risk, head, on, collisions, are, rare, due, to, use, of, double, track, and, low, operating, speeds, reduce, the, occurrence, and, severity, of, rear, end, collisions, and, derailments, fire, is, more, of, a, danger, underground, such, as, the, king, s, cross, fire, in, london, in, november, 1987, which, killed, 31, people, systems, are, generally, built, to, allow, evacuation, of, trains, at, many, places, throughout, the, system, high, platforms, usually, over, 1, meter, 3, feet, are, a, safety, risk, as, people, falling, onto, the, tracks, have, trouble, climbing, back, platform, screen, doors, are, used, on, some, systems, to, eliminate, this, danger, rapid, transit, facilities, are, public, spaces, and, may, suffer, from, security, problems, petty, crimes, such, as, pickpocketing, and, baggage, theft, and, more, serious, violent, crimes, as, well, as, sexual, assaults, on, tightly, packed, trains, and, platforms, security, measures, include, video, surveillance, security, guards, and, conductors, in, some, countries, a, specialized, transit, police, may, be, established, these, security, measures, are, normally, integrated, with, measures, to, protect, revenue, by, checking, that, passengers, are, not, travelling, without, paying, some, subway, systems, such, as, the, beijing, subway, which, is, ranked, by, worldwide, rapid, transit, data, as, the, world, s, safest, rapid, transit, network, in, 2015, incorporates, airport, style, security, checkpoints, at, every, station, rapid, transit, systems, have, been, subject, to, terrorism, with, many, casualties, such, as, the, 1995, tokyo, subway, sarin, gas, attack, and, the, 2005, 7, 7, terrorist, bombings, on, the, london, underground, some, rapid, transport, trains, have, extra, features, such, as, wall, sockets, cellular, reception, typically, using, a, leaky, feeder, in, tunnels, and, das, antennas, in, stations, as, well, as, wi, fi, connectivity, the, first, metro, system, in, the, world, to, enable, full, mobile, phone, reception, in, underground, stations, and, tunnels, was, singapore, s, mass, rapid, transit, mrt, system, which, launched, its, first, underground, mobile, phone, network, using, amps, in, 1989, many, metro, systems, such, as, the, hong, kong, mass, transit, railway, mtr, and, the, berlin, u, bahn, provide, mobile, data, connections, in, their, tunnels, for, various, network, operators, the, technology, used, for, public, mass, rapid, transit, has, undergone, significant, changes, in, the, years, since, the, metropolitan, railway, opened, publicly, in, london, in, 1863, high, capacity, monorails, with, larger, and, longer, trains, can, be, classified, as, rapid, transit, systems, such, monorail, systems, recently, started, operating, in, chongqing, and, s, o, paulo, light, metro, is, a, subclass, of, rapid, transit, that, has, the, speed, and, grade, separation, of, a, full, metro, but, is, designed, for, smaller, passenger, numbers, it, often, has, smaller, loading, gauges, lighter, train, cars, and, smaller, consists, of, typically, two, to, four, cars, light, metros, are, typically, used, as, feeder, lines, into, the, main, rapid, transit, system, for, instance, the, wenhu, line, of, the, taipei, metro, serves, many, relatively, sparse, neighbourhoods, and, feeds, into, and, complements, the, high, capacity, metro, lines, some, systems, have, been, built, from, scratch, others, are, reclaimed, from, former, commuter, rail, or, suburban, tramway, systems, that, have, been, upgraded, and, often, supplemented, with, an, underground, or, elevated, downtown, section, ground, level, alignments, with, a, dedicated, right, of, way, are, typically, used, only, outside, dense, areas, since, they, create, a, physical, barrier, in, the, urban, fabric, that, hinders, the, flow, of, people, and, vehicles, across, their, path, and, have, a, larger, physical, footprint, this, method, of, construction, is, the, cheapest, as, long, as, land, values, are, low, it, is, often, used, for, new, systems, in, areas, that, are, planned, to, fill, up, with, buildings, after, the, line, is, built, most, rapid, transit, trains, are, electric, multiple, units, with, lengths, from, three, to, over, ten, cars, crew, sizes, have, decreased, throughout, history, with, some, modern, systems, now, running, completely, unstaffed, trains, other, trains, continue, to, have, drivers, even, if, their, only, role, in, normal, operation, is, to, open, and, close, the, doors, of, the, trains, at, stations, power, is, commonly, delivered, by, a, third, rail, or, by, overhead, wires, the, whole, london, underground, network, uses, fourth, rail, and, others, use, the, linear, motor, for, propulsion, some, urban, rail, lines, are, built, to, a, loading, gauge, as, large, as, that, of, main, line, railways, others, are, built, to, a, smaller, one, and, have, tunnels, that, restrict, the, size, and, sometimes, the, shape, of, the, train, compartments, one, example, is, most, of, the, london, underground, which, has, acquired, the, informal, term, tube, train, due, to, the, cylindrical, shape, of, the, trains, used, on, the, deep, tube, lines, historically, rapid, transit, trains, used, ceiling, fans, and, openable, windows, to, provide, fresh, air, and, piston, effect, wind, cooling, to, riders, from, the, 1950s, to, the, 1990s, and, in, most, of, europe, until, the, 2000s, many, rapid, transit, trains, from, that, era, were, also, fitted, with, forced, air, ventilation, systems, in, carriage, ceiling, units, for, passenger, comfort, early, rapid, transit, rolling, stock, fitted, with, air, conditioning, such, as, the, hudson, and, manhattan, railroad, k, series, cars, from, 1958, the, new, york, city, subway, r38, and, r42, cars, from, the, late, 1960s, and, the, nagoya, municipal, subway, 3000, series, osaka, municipal, subway, 10, series, and, mtr, m, train, emus, from, the, 1970s, were, generally, only, made, possible, largely, due, to, the, relatively, generous, loading, gauges, of, these, systems, and, also, adequate, open, air, sections, to, dissipate, hot, air, from, these, air, conditioning, units, especially, in, some, rapid, transit, systems, such, as, the, montreal, metro, opened, 1966, and, sapporo, municipal, subway, opened, 1971, their, entirely, enclosed, nature, due, to, their, use, of, rubber, tyred, technology, to, cope, with, heavy, snowfall, experienced, by, both, cities, in, winter, precludes, any, air, conditioning, retrofits, of, rolling, stock, due, to, the, risk, of, heating, the, tunnels, to, temperatures, that, would, be, too, hot, for, passengers, and, for, train, operations, in, many, cities, metro, networks, consist, of, lines, operating, different, sizes, and, types, of, vehicles, although, these, sub, networks, may, not, often, be, connected, by, track, in, cases, when, it, is, necessary, rolling, stock, with, a, smaller, loading, gauge, from, one, sub, network, may, be, transported, along, other, lines, that, use, larger, trains, on, some, networks, such, operations, are, part, of, normal, services, most, rapid, transit, systems, use, conventional, standard, gauge, railway, track, since, tracks, in, subway, tunnels, are, not, exposed, to, rain, snow, or, other, forms, of, precipitation, they, are, often, fixed, directly, to, the, floor, rather, than, resting, on, ballast, such, as, normal, railway, tracks, an, alternate, technology, using, rubber, tires, on, narrow, concrete, or, steel, roll, ways, was, pioneered, on, certain, lines, of, the, paris, m, tro, and, mexico, city, metro, and, the, first, completely, new, system, to, use, it, was, in, montreal, canada, on, most, of, these, networks, additional, horizontal, wheels, are, required, for, guidance, and, a, conventional, track, is, often, provided, in, case, of, flat, tires, and, for, switching, there, are, also, some, rubber, tired, systems, that, use, a, central, guide, rail, such, as, the, sapporo, municipal, subway, and, the, neoval, system, in, rennes, france, advocates, of, this, system, note, that, it, is, much, quieter, than, conventional, steel, wheeled, trains, and, allows, for, greater, inclines, given, the, increased, traction, of, the, rubber, tires, however, they, have, higher, maintenance, costs, and, are, less, energy, efficient, they, also, lose, traction, when, weather, conditions, are, wet, or, icy, preventing, above, ground, use, of, the, montr, al, metro, and, limiting, it, on, the, sapporo, municipal, subway, but, not, rubber, tired, systems, in, other, cities, some, cities, with, steep, hills, incorporate, mountain, railway, technologies, in, their, metros, one, of, the, lines, of, the, lyon, metro, includes, a, section, of, rack, cog, railway, while, the, carmelit, in, haifa, is, an, underground, funicular, for, elevated, lines, another, alternative, is, the, monorail, which, can, be, built, either, as, straddle, beam, monorails, or, as, a, suspended, monorail, while, monorails, have, never, gained, wide, acceptance, outside, japan, there, are, some, such, as, chongqing, rail, transit, s, monorail, lines, which, are, widely, used, in, a, rapid, transit, setting, although, trains, on, very, early, rapid, transit, systems, like, the, metropolitan, railway, were, powered, using, steam, engines, either, via, cable, haulage, or, steam, locomotives, nowadays, virtually, all, metro, trains, use, electric, power, and, are, built, to, run, as, multiple, units, power, for, the, trains, referred, to, as, traction, power, is, usually, supplied, via, one, of, two, forms, an, overhead, line, suspended, from, poles, or, towers, along, the, track, or, from, structure, or, tunnel, ceilings, or, a, third, rail, mounted, at, track, level, and, contacted, by, a, sliding, pickup, shoe, the, practice, of, sending, power, through, rails, on, the, ground, is, mainly, due, to, the, limited, overhead, clearance, of, tunnels, which, physically, prevents, the, use, of, overhead, wires, the, use, of, overhead, wires, allows, higher, power, supply, voltages, to, be, used, overhead, wires, are, more, likely, to, be, used, on, metro, systems, without, many, tunnels, for, example, the, shanghai, metro, overhead, wires, are, employed, on, some, systems, that, are, predominantly, underground, as, in, barcelona, fukuoka, hong, kong, madrid, and, shijiazhuang, both, overhead, wire, and, third, rail, systems, usually, use, the, running, rails, as, the, return, conductor, some, systems, use, a, separate, fourth, rail, for, this, purpose, there, are, transit, lines, that, make, use, of, both, rail, and, overhead, power, with, vehicles, able, to, switch, between, the, two, such, as, blue, line, in, boston, most, rapid, transit, systems, use, direct, current, but, some, systems, in, india, including, delhi, metro, use, 25, kv, 50, hz, supplied, by, overhead, wires, at, subterranean, levels, tunnels, move, traffic, away, from, street, level, avoiding, delays, caused, by, traffic, congestion, and, leaving, more, land, available, for, buildings, and, other, uses, in, areas, of, high, land, prices, and, dense, land, use, tunnels, may, be, the, only, economic, route, for, mass, transportation, cut, and, cover, tunnels, are, constructed, by, digging, up, city, streets, which, are, then, rebuilt, over, the, tunnel, alternatively, tunnel, boring, machines, can, be, used, to, dig, deep, bore, tunnels, that, lie, further, down, in, bedrock, the, construction, of, an, underground, metro, is, an, expensive, project, and, is, often, carried, out, over, a, number, of, years, there, are, several, different, methods, of, building, underground, lines, in, one, common, method, known, as, cut, and, cover, the, city, streets, are, excavated, and, a, tunnel, structure, strong, enough, to, support, the, road, above, is, built, in, the, trench, which, is, then, filled, in, and, the, roadway, rebuilt, this, method, often, involves, extensive, relocation, of, utilities, commonly, buried, not, far, below, street, level, particularly, power, and, telephone, wiring, water, and, gas, mains, and, sewers, this, relocation, must, be, done, carefully, as, according, to, documentaries, from, the, national, geographic, society, one, of, the, causes, of, the, april, 1992, explosions, in, guadalajara, was, a, mislocated, water, pipeline, the, structures, are, typically, made, of, concrete, perhaps, with, structural, columns, of, steel, in, the, oldest, systems, brick, and, cast, iron, were, used, cut, and, cover, construction, can, take, so, long, that, it, is, often, necessary, to, build, a, temporary, roadbed, while, construction, is, going, on, underneath, in, order, to, avoid, closing, main, streets, for, long, periods, of, time, another, tunneling, method, is, called, bored, tunneling, here, construction, starts, with, a, vertical, shaft, from, which, tunnels, are, horizontally, dug, often, with, a, tunneling, shield, thus, avoiding, almost, any, disturbance, to, existing, streets, buildings, and, utilities, but, problems, with, ground, water, are, more, likely, and, tunneling, through, native, bedrock, may, require, blasting, the, first, city, to, extensively, use, deep, tunneling, was, london, where, a, thick, sedimentary, layer, of, clay, largely, avoids, both, problems, the, confined, space, in, the, tunnel, also, limits, the, machinery, that, can, be, used, but, specialized, tunnel, boring, machines, are, now, available, to, overcome, this, challenge, a, disadvantage, with, this, is, that, the, cost, of, tunneling, is, much, higher, than, building, cut, and, cover, systems, at, grade, or, elevated, early, tunneling, machines, could, not, make, tunnels, large, enough, for, conventional, railway, equipment, necessitating, special, low, round, trains, such, as, are, still, used, by, most, of, the, london, underground, it, cannot, install, air, conditioning, on, most, of, its, lines, because, the, amount, of, empty, space, between, the, trains, and, tunnel, walls, is, so, small, other, lines, were, built, with, cut, and, cover, and, have, since, been, equipped, with, air, conditioned, trains, the, deepest, metro, system, in, the, world, was, built, in, st, petersburg, russia, where, in, the, marshland, stable, soil, starts, more, than, 50, metres, 160, ft, deep, above, that, level, the, soil, mostly, consists, of, water, bearing, finely, dispersed, sand, because, of, this, only, three, stations, out, of, nearly, 60, are, built, near, ground, level, and, three, more, above, the, ground, some, stations, and, tunnels, lie, as, deep, as, 100, 120, metres, 330, 390, ft, below, the, surface, usually, the, vertical, distance, between, the, ground, level, and, the, rail, is, used, to, represent, the, depth, among, the, possible, candidates, are, an, advantage, of, deep, tunnels, is, that, they, can, dip, in, a, basin, like, profile, between, stations, without, incurring, the, significant, extra, costs, associated, with, digging, near, ground, level, this, technique, also, referred, to, as, putting, stations, on, humps, allows, gravity, to, assist, the, trains, as, they, accelerate, from, one, station, and, brake, at, the, next, it, was, used, as, early, as, 1890, on, parts, of, the, city, and, south, london, railway, and, has, been, used, many, times, since, for, example, in, montreal, or, nuremberg, the, west, island, line, an, extension, of, the, mtr, island, line, serving, western, hong, kong, island, opened, in, 2015, has, two, stations, sai, ying, pun, and, hku, situated, over, 100, metres, 330, ft, below, ground, level, to, serve, passengers, on, the, mid, levels, they, have, several, entrances, exits, equipped, with, high, speed, lifts, instead, of, escalators, these, kinds, of, exits, have, existed, in, many, london, underground, stations, and, stations, in, former, soviet, union, nations, elevated, railways, are, a, cheaper, and, easier, way, to, build, an, exclusive, right, of, way, without, digging, expensive, tunnels, or, creating, barriers, in, addition, to, street, level, railways, they, may, also, be, the, only, other, feasible, alternative, due, to, considerations, such, as, a, high, water, table, close, to, the, city, surface, that, raises, the, cost, of, or, even, precludes, underground, railways, e, g, miami, elevated, guideways, were, popular, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, but, fell, out, of, favor, they, came, back, into, fashion, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, century, often, in, combination, with, driverless, systems, for, instance, vancouver, s, skytrain, london, s, docklands, light, railway, the, miami, metrorail, bangkok, skytrain, and, skyline, honolulu, stations, function, as, hubs, to, allow, passengers, to, board, and, disembark, from, trains, they, are, also, payment, checkpoints, and, allow, passengers, to, transfer, between, modes, of, transport, for, instance, to, buses, or, other, trains, access, is, provided, via, either, island, or, side, platforms, underground, stations, especially, deep, level, ones, increase, the, overall, transport, time, long, escalator, rides, to, the, platforms, mean, that, the, stations, can, become, bottlenecks, if, not, adequately, built, some, underground, and, elevated, stations, are, integrated, into, vast, underground, or, skyway, networks, respectively, that, connect, to, nearby, commercial, buildings, in, suburbs, there, may, be, a, park, and, ride, connected, to, the, station, to, allow, easy, access, to, the, trains, the, platform, height, allows, step, free, access, between, platform, and, train, if, the, station, complies, with, accessibility, standards, it, allows, both, disabled, people, and, those, with, wheeled, baggage, easy, access, to, the, trains, though, if, the, track, is, curved, there, can, be, a, gap, between, the, train, and, platform, some, stations, use, platform, screen, doors, to, increase, safety, by, preventing, people, falling, onto, the, tracks, as, well, as, reducing, ventilation, costs, particularly, in, the, former, soviet, union, and, other, eastern, european, countries, but, to, an, increasing, extent, elsewhere, the, stations, were, built, with, splendid, decorations, such, as, marble, walls, polished, granite, floors, and, mosaics, thus, exposing, the, public, to, art, in, their, everyday, life, outside, galleries, and, museums, moscow, metro, s, wall, cladding, contains, many, fossils, from, corals, to, ammonoids, and, nautiluses, the, systems, in, moscow, st, petersburg, tashkent, and, kyiv, are, widely, regarded, as, some, of, the, most, beautiful, in, the, world, several, other, cities, such, as, london, stockholm, montreal, lisbon, naples, and, los, angeles, have, also, focused, on, art, which, may, range, from, decorative, wall, claddings, to, large, flamboyant, artistic, schemes, integrated, with, station, architecture, to, displays, of, ancient, artifacts, recovered, during, station, construction, it, may, be, possible, to, profit, by, attracting, more, passengers, by, spending, relatively, small, amounts, on, grand, architecture, art, cleanliness, accessibility, lighting, and, a, feeling, of, safety, in, the, early, days, of, underground, railways, at, least, two, staff, members, were, needed, to, operate, each, train, one, or, more, attendants, also, called, conductor, or, guard, to, operate, the, doors, or, gates, as, well, as, a, driver, also, called, the, engineer, or, motorman, the, introduction, of, powered, doors, around, 1920, permitted, crew, sizes, to, be, reduced, and, trains, in, many, cities, are, now, operated, by, a, single, person, where, the, operator, would, not, be, able, to, see, the, whole, side, of, the, train, to, tell, whether, the, doors, can, be, safely, closed, mirrors, or, closed, circuit, tv, monitors, are, often, provided, for, that, purpose, a, replacement, system, for, human, drivers, became, available, in, the, 1960s, with, the, advancement, of, computerized, technologies, for, automatic, train, control, and, later, automatic, train, operation, ato, ato, could, start, a, train, accelerate, to, the, correct, speed, and, stop, automatically, in, the, correct, position, at, the, railway, platform, at, the, next, station, while, taking, into, account, the, information, that, a, human, driver, would, obtain, from, lineside, or, cab, signals, the, first, metro, line, to, use, this, technology, in, its, entirety, was, london, s, victoria, line, opened, in, 1968, in, normal, operation, a, crew, member, sits, in, the, driver, s, position, at, the, front, but, is, only, responsible, for, closing, the, doors, at, each, station, by, pressing, two, start, buttons, the, train, would, then, move, automatically, to, the, next, station, this, style, of, semi, automatic, train, operation, sto, known, technically, as, grade, of, automation, goa, 2, has, become, widespread, especially, on, newly, built, lines, like, the, san, francisco, bay, area, s, bart, network, a, variant, of, ato, driverless, train, operation, dto, or, technically, goa, 3, is, seen, on, some, systems, as, in, london, s, docklands, light, railway, which, opened, in, 1987, here, a, passenger, service, agent, formerly, called, train, captain, would, ride, with, the, passengers, rather, than, sit, at, the, front, as, a, driver, would, but, would, have, the, same, responsibilities, as, a, driver, in, a, goa, 2, system, this, technology, could, allow, trains, to, operate, completely, automatically, with, no, crew, just, as, most, elevators, do, when, the, initially, increasing, costs, for, automation, began, to, decrease, this, became, a, financially, attractive, option, for, the, operators, at, the, same, time, countervailing, arguments, stated, that, in, an, emergency, situation, a, crew, member, on, board, the, train, would, have, possibly, been, able, to, prevent, the, emergency, in, the, first, place, drive, a, partially, failed, train, to, the, next, station, assist, with, an, evacuation, if, needed, or, call, for, the, correct, emergency, services, and, help, direct, them, to, the, location, where, the, emergency, occurred, in, some, cities, the, same, reasons, are, used, to, justify, a, crew, of, two, rather, than, one, one, person, drives, from, the, front, of, the, train, while, the, other, operates, the, doors, from, a, position, farther, back, and, is, more, conveniently, able, to, assist, passengers, in, the, rear, cars, an, example, of, the, presence, of, a, driver, purely, due, to, union, opposition, is, the, scarborough, rt, line, in, toronto, completely, unstaffed, trains, or, unattended, train, operation, uto, or, technically, goa, 4, are, more, accepted, on, newer, systems, where, there, are, no, existing, crews, to, be, displaced, and, especially, on, light, metro, lines, one, of, the, first, such, systems, was, the, val, v, hicule, automatique, l, ger, or, automated, light, vehicle, first, used, in, 1983, on, the, lille, metro, in, france, additional, val, lines, have, been, built, in, other, cities, such, as, toulouse, france, and, turin, italy, another, system, that, uses, unstaffed, trains, is, bombardier, s, innovia, metro, originally, developed, by, the, urban, transportation, development, corporation, as, the, intermediate, capacity, transit, system, icts, it, was, later, used, on, the, skytrain, in, vancouver, and, the, kelana, jaya, line, in, kuala, lumpur, both, of, which, carry, no, crew, members, another, obstacle, to, conversion, of, existing, lines, to, fully, automated, operation, is, that, the, conversion, may, necessitate, a, shutdown, of, operations, furthermore, where, several, lines, share, the, same, infrastructure, it, may, be, necessary, to, share, tracks, between, automated, and, human, operated, trains, at, least, for, a, transitory, period, the, nuremberg, u, bahn, converted, the, existing, u2, to, fully, automated, goa4, in, early, 2010, without, a, single, day, of, service, disruption, before, that, it, had, run, in, mixed, operation, with, the, newly, opened, fully, driverless, u3, from, 2008, nuremberg, u, bahn, was, the, first, system, in, the, world, to, undertake, such, a, transition, with, mixed, operation, and, without, service, disruption, while, this, demonstrates, that, those, technological, hurdles, can, be, overcome, the, project, was, severely, delayed, missing, the, target, of, being, in, operation, in, time, for, the, 2006, fifa, world, cup, and, the, hoped, for, international, orders, for, the, system, of, automation, employed, in, nuremberg, never, materialized, systems, that, use, automatic, trains, also, commonly, employ, full, height, platform, screen, doors, or, half, height, automatic, platform, gates, in, order, to, improve, safety, and, ensure, passenger, confidence, but, this, is, not, universal, as, networks, like, nuremberg, do, not, using, infrared, sensors, instead, to, detect, obstacles, on, the, track, conversely, some, lines, which, retain, drivers, or, manual, train, operation, nevertheless, use, psds, notably, london, s, jubilee, line, extension, the, first, network, to, install, psds, on, an, already, operational, system, was, hong, kong, s, mtr, followed, by, the, singapore, mrt, as, for, larger, trains, the, paris, m, tro, has, human, drivers, on, most, lines, but, runs, automated, trains, on, its, newest, line, line, 14, which, opened, in, 1998, the, older, line, 1, was, subsequently, converted, to, unattended, operation, by, 2012, and, it, is, expected, that, line, 4, will, follow, by, 2023, the, north, east, mrt, line, in, singapore, which, opened, in, 2003, is, the, world, s, first, fully, automated, underground, urban, heavy, rail, line, the, mtr, disneyland, resort, line, is, also, automated, along, with, trains, on, the, south, island, line, since, the, 1980s, trams, have, incorporated, several, features, of, rapid, transit, light, rail, systems, trams, run, on, their, own, rights, of, way, thus, avoiding, congestion, they, remain, on, the, same, level, as, buses, and, cars, some, light, rail, systems, have, elevated, or, underground, sections, both, new, and, upgraded, tram, systems, allow, faster, speed, and, higher, capacity, and, are, a, cheap, alternative, to, construction, of, rapid, transit, especially, in, smaller, cities, a, premetro, design, means, that, an, underground, rapid, transit, system, is, built, in, the, city, center, but, only, a, light, rail, or, tram, system, in, the, suburbs, conversely, other, cities, have, opted, to, build, a, full, metro, in, the, suburbs, but, run, trams, in, city, streets, to, save, the, cost, of, expensive, tunnels, in, north, america, interurbans, were, constructed, as, street, running, suburban, trams, without, the, grade, separation, of, rapid, transit, premetros, also, allow, a, gradual, upgrade, of, existing, tramways, to, rapid, transit, thus, spreading, the, investment, costs, over, time, they, are, most, common, in, germany, with, the, name, stadtbahn, suburban, commuter, rail, is, a, heavy, rail, system, that, operates, at, a, lower, frequency, than, urban, rapid, transit, with, higher, average, speeds, often, only, serving, one, station, in, each, village, and, town, commuter, rail, systems, of, some, cities, such, as, german, s, bahns, jakarta, s, krl, commuterline, mumbai, suburban, railway, australian, suburban, networks, danish, s, tog, etc, can, be, seen, as, the, substitute, for, the, city, s, rapid, transit, system, providing, frequent, mass, transit, within, city, in, contrast, the, mainly, urban, rapid, transit, systems, in, some, cities, such, as, the, dubai, metro, shanghai, metro, metrosur, of, the, madrid, metro, taipei, metro, kuala, lumpur, rapid, transit, etc, have, lines, that, fan, out, to, reach, the, outer, suburbs, with, some, other, urban, or, near, urban, rapid, transit, systems, guangfo, metro, bay, area, rapid, transit, los, teques, metro, and, seoul, subway, line, 7, etc, serving, bi, and, multi, nucleus, agglomerations, some, cities, have, opted, for, two, tiers, of, urban, railways, an, urban, rapid, transit, system, such, as, the, paris, m, tro, berlin, u, bahn, london, underground, sydney, metro, tokyo, subway, jakarta, mrt, and, philadelphia, subway, and, a, suburban, system, such, as, their, counterparts, rer, s, bahn, crossrail, london, overground, sydney, trains, jr, urban, lines, krl, commuterline, and, regional, rail, respectively, such, systems, are, known, variously, as, s, trains, suburban, service, or, sometimes, regional, rail, the, suburban, systems, may, have, their, own, purpose, built, trackage, run, at, similar, rapid, transit, like, frequencies, and, in, many, countries, are, operated, by, the, national, railway, company, in, some, cities, these, suburban, services, run, through, tunnels, in, the, city, center, and, have, direct, transfers, to, the, rapid, transit, system, on, the, same, or, adjoining, platforms, in, some, cases, such, as, the, london, underground, and, the, london, overground, suburban, and, rapid, transit, systems, even, run, on, the, exact, same, track, along, some, sections, california, s, bart, federal, district, s, metr, df, and, washington, s, metrorail, system, is, an, example, of, a, hybrid, of, the, two, in, the, suburbs, the, lines, function, like, a, commuter, rail, line, with, longer, intervals, and, longer, distance, between, stations, in, the, downtown, areas, the, stations, become, closer, together, and, many, lines, interline, with, intervals, dropping, to, typical, rapid, transit, headways, as, of, march, 2018, 212, cities, have, built, rapid, transit, systems, the, capital, cost, is, high, as, is, the, risk, of, cost, overrun, and, benefit, shortfall, public, financing, is, normally, required, rapid, transit, is, sometimes, seen, as, an, alternative, to, an, extensive, road, transport, system, with, many, motorways, the, rapid, transit, system, allows, higher, capacity, with, less, land, use, less, environmental, impact, and, a, lower, cost, a, 2023, study, found, that, rapid, transit, systems, lead, to, a, massive, reduction, in, co, 2, emissions, elevated, or, underground, systems, in, city, centers, allow, the, transport, of, people, without, occupying, expensive, land, and, permit, the, city, to, develop, compactly, without, physical, barriers, motorways, often, depress, nearby, residential, land, values, but, proximity, to, a, rapid, transit, station, often, triggers, commercial, and, residential, growth, with, large, transit, oriented, development, office, and, housing, blocks, being, constructed, also, an, efficient, transit, system, can, decrease, the, economic, welfare, loss, caused, by, the, increase, of, population, density, in, a, metropolis, rapid, transit, systems, have, high, fixed, costs, most, systems, are, publicly, owned, by, either, local, governments, transit, authorities, or, national, governments, capital, investments, are, often, partially, or, completely, financed, by, taxation, rather, than, by, passenger, fares, but, must, often, compete, with, funding, for, roads, the, transit, systems, may, be, operated, by, the, owner, or, by, a, private, company, through, a, public, service, obligation, the, owners, of, the, systems, often, also, own, the, connecting, bus, or, rail, systems, or, are, members, of, the, local, transport, association, allowing, for, free, transfers, between, modes, almost, all, transit, systems, operate, at, a, deficit, requiring, fare, revenue, advertising, and, government, funding, to, cover, costs, the, farebox, recovery, ratio, a, ratio, of, ticket, income, to, operating, costs, is, often, used, to, assess, operational, profitability, with, some, systems, including, hong, kong, s, mtr, corporation, and, taipei, achieving, recovery, ratios, of, well, over, 100, this, ignores, both, heavy, capital, costs, incurred, in, building, the, system, which, are, often, funded, with, soft, loans, and, whose, servicing, is, excluded, from, calculations, of, profitability, as, well, as, ancillary, revenue, such, as, income, from, real, estate, portfolios, some, systems, particularly, hong, kong, s, extensions, are, partly, financed, by, the, sale, of, land, whose, value, has, appreciated, by, the, new, access, the, extension, has, brought, to, the, area, a, process, known, as, value, capture, urban, land, use, planning, policies, are, essential, for, the, success, of, rapid, transit, systems, particularly, as, mass, transit, is, not, feasible, in, low, density, communities, transportation, planners, estimate, that, to, support, rapid, rail, services, there, must, be, a, residential, housing, density, of, twelve, dwelling, units, per, acre
