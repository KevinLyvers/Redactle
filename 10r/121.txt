a, sensor, is, a, device, that, produces, an, output, signal, for, the, purpose, of, detecting, a, physical, phenomenon, in, the, broadest, definition, a, sensor, is, a, device, module, machine, or, subsystem, that, detects, events, or, changes, in, its, environment, and, sends, the, information, to, other, electronics, frequently, a, computer, processor, sensors, are, used, in, everyday, objects, such, as, touch, sensitive, elevator, buttons, tactile, sensor, and, lamps, which, dim, or, brighten, by, touching, the, base, and, in, innumerable, applications, of, which, most, people, are, never, aware, with, advances, in, micromachinery, and, easy, to, use, microcontroller, platforms, the, uses, of, sensors, have, expanded, beyond, the, traditional, fields, of, temperature, pressure, and, flow, measurement, for, example, into, marg, sensors, analog, sensors, such, as, potentiometers, and, force, sensing, resistors, are, still, widely, used, their, applications, include, manufacturing, and, machinery, airplanes, and, aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics, and, many, other, aspects, of, our, day, to, day, life, there, is, a, wide, range, of, other, sensors, that, measure, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, materials, including, optical, sensors, for, refractive, index, measurement, vibrational, sensors, for, fluid, viscosity, measurement, and, electro, chemical, sensors, for, monitoring, ph, of, fluids, a, sensor, s, sensitivity, indicates, how, much, its, output, changes, when, the, input, quantity, it, measures, changes, for, instance, if, the, mercury, in, a, thermometer, moves, 1, cm, when, the, temperature, changes, by, 1, c, its, sensitivity, is, 1, cm, c, it, is, basically, the, slope, dy, dx, assuming, a, linear, characteristic, some, sensors, can, also, affect, what, they, measure, for, instance, a, room, temperature, thermometer, inserted, into, a, hot, cup, of, liquid, cools, the, liquid, while, the, liquid, heats, the, thermometer, sensors, are, usually, designed, to, have, a, small, effect, on, what, is, measured, making, the, sensor, smaller, often, improves, this, and, may, introduce, other, advantages, technological, progress, allows, more, and, more, sensors, to, be, manufactured, on, a, microscopic, scale, as, microsensors, using, mems, technology, in, most, cases, a, microsensor, reaches, a, significantly, faster, measurement, time, and, higher, sensitivity, compared, with, macroscopic, approaches, due, to, the, increasing, demand, for, rapid, affordable, and, reliable, information, in, today, s, world, disposable, sensors, low, cost, and, easy, to, use, devices, for, short, term, monitoring, or, single, shot, measurements, have, recently, gained, growing, importance, using, this, class, of, sensors, critical, analytical, information, can, be, obtained, by, anyone, anywhere, and, at, any, time, without, the, need, for, recalibration, and, worrying, about, contamination, a, good, sensor, obeys, the, following, rules, most, sensors, have, a, linear, transfer, function, the, sensitivity, is, then, defined, as, the, ratio, between, the, output, signal, and, measured, property, for, example, if, a, sensor, measures, temperature, and, has, a, voltage, output, the, sensitivity, is, constant, with, the, units, the, sensitivity, is, the, slope, of, the, transfer, function, converting, the, sensor, s, electrical, output, for, example, v, to, the, measured, units, for, example, k, requires, dividing, the, electrical, output, by, the, slope, or, multiplying, by, its, reciprocal, in, addition, an, offset, is, frequently, added, or, subtracted, for, example, 40, must, be, added, to, the, output, if, 0, v, output, corresponds, to, 40, c, input, for, an, analog, sensor, signal, to, be, processed, or, used, in, digital, equipment, it, needs, to, be, converted, to, a, digital, signal, using, an, analog, to, digital, converter, since, sensors, cannot, replicate, an, ideal, transfer, function, several, types, of, deviations, can, occur, which, limit, sensor, accuracy, all, these, deviations, can, be, classified, as, systematic, errors, or, random, errors, systematic, errors, can, sometimes, be, compensated, for, by, means, of, some, kind, of, calibration, strategy, noise, is, a, random, error, that, can, be, reduced, by, signal, processing, such, as, filtering, usually, at, the, expense, of, the, dynamic, behavior, of, the, sensor, the, sensor, resolution, or, measurement, resolution, is, the, smallest, change, that, can, be, detected, in, the, quantity, that, is, being, measured, the, resolution, of, a, sensor, with, a, digital, output, is, usually, the, numerical, resolution, of, the, digital, output, the, resolution, is, related, to, the, precision, with, which, the, measurement, is, made, but, they, are, not, the, same, thing, a, sensor, s, accuracy, may, be, considerably, worse, than, its, resolution, a, chemical, sensor, is, a, self, contained, analytical, device, that, can, provide, information, about, the, chemical, composition, of, its, environment, that, is, a, liquid, or, a, gas, phase, the, information, is, provided, in, the, form, of, a, measurable, physical, signal, that, is, correlated, with, the, concentration, of, a, certain, chemical, species, termed, as, analyte, two, main, steps, are, involved, in, the, functioning, of, a, chemical, sensor, namely, recognition, and, transduction, in, the, recognition, step, analyte, molecules, interact, selectively, with, receptor, molecules, or, sites, included, in, the, structure, of, the, recognition, element, of, the, sensor, consequently, a, characteristic, physical, parameter, varies, and, this, variation, is, reported, by, means, of, an, integrated, transducer, that, generates, the, output, signal, a, chemical, sensor, based, on, recognition, material, of, biological, nature, is, a, biosensor, however, as, synthetic, biomimetic, materials, are, going, to, substitute, to, some, extent, recognition, biomaterials, a, sharp, distinction, between, a, biosensor, and, a, standard, chemical, sensor, is, superfluous, typical, biomimetic, materials, used, in, sensor, development, are, molecularly, imprinted, polymers, and, aptamers, in, biomedicine, and, biotechnology, sensors, which, detect, analytes, thanks, to, a, biological, component, such, as, cells, protein, nucleic, acid, or, biomimetic, polymers, are, called, biosensors, whereas, a, non, biological, sensor, even, organic, carbon, chemistry, for, biological, analytes, is, referred, to, as, sensor, or, nanosensor, this, terminology, applies, for, both, in, vitro, and, in, vivo, applications, the, encapsulation, of, the, biological, component, in, biosensors, presents, a, slightly, different, problem, that, ordinary, sensors, this, can, either, be, done, by, means, of, a, semipermeable, barrier, such, as, a, dialysis, membrane, or, a, hydrogel, or, a, 3d, polymer, matrix, which, either, physically, constrains, the, sensing, macromolecule, or, chemically, constrains, the, macromolecule, by, bounding, it, to, the, scaffold, neuromorphic, sensors, are, sensors, that, physically, mimic, structures, and, functions, of, biological, neural, entities, one, example, of, this, is, the, event, camera, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, technology, originates, from, the, mosfet, mos, field, effect, transistor, or, mos, transistor, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, in, 1959, and, demonstrated, in, 1960, mosfet, sensors, mos, sensors, were, later, developed, and, they, have, since, been, widely, used, to, measure, physical, chemical, biological, and, environmental, parameters, a, number, of, mosfet, sensors, have, been, developed, for,

dna, field, effect, transistor, dnafet, gene, modified, fet, genfet, and, cell, potential, biofet, cpfet, had, been, developed, mos, technology, is, the, basis, for, modern, image, sensors, including, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, and, the, cmos, active, pixel, sensor, cmos, sensor, used, in, digital, imaging, and, digital, cameras, willard, boyle, and, george, e, smith, developed, the, ccd, in, 1969, while, researching, the, mos, process, they, realized, that, an, electric, charge, was, the, analogy, of, the, magnetic, bubble, and, that, it, could, be, stored, on, a, tiny, mos, capacitor, as, it, was, fairly, straightforward, to, fabricate, a, series, of, mos, capacitors, in, a, row, they, connected, a, suitable, voltage, to, them, so, that, the, charge, could, be, stepped, along, from, one, to, the, next, the, ccd, is, a, semiconductor, circuit, that, was, later, used, in, the, first, digital, video, cameras, for, television, broadcasting, the, mos, active, pixel, sensor, aps, was, developed, by, tsutomu, nakamura, at, olympus, in, 1985, the, cmos, active, pixel, sensor, was, later, developed, by, eric, fossum, and, his, team, in, the, early, 1990s, mos, image,
