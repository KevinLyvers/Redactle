stealth, technology, also, termed, low, observable, technology, lo, technology, is, a, sub, discipline, of, military, tactics, and, passive, and, active, electronic, countermeasures, which, covers, a, range, of, methods, used, to, make, personnel, aircraft, ships, submarines, missiles, satellites, and, ground, vehicles, less, visible, ideally, invisible, to, radar, infrared, sonar, and, other, detection, methods, it, corresponds, to, military, camouflage, for, these, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, i, e, multi, spectral, camouflage, development, of, modern, stealth, technologies, in, the, united, states, began, in, 1958, where, earlier, attempts, to, prevent, radar, tracking, of, its, u, 2, spy, planes, during, the, cold, war, by, the, soviet, union, had, been, unsuccessful, designers, turned, to, developing, a, specific, shape, for, planes, that, tended, to, reduce, detection, by, redirecting, electromagnetic, radiation, waves, from, radars, radiation, absorbent, material, was, also, tested, and, made, to, reduce, or, block, radar, signals, that, reflect, off, the, surfaces, of, aircraft, such, changes, to, shape, and, surface, composition, comprise, stealth, technology, as, currently, used, on, the, northrop, grumman, b, 2, spirit, stealth, bomber, the, concept, of, stealth, is, to, operate, or, hide, while, giving, enemy, forces, no, indication, as, to, the, presence, of, friendly, forces, this, concept, was, first, explored, through, camouflage, to, make, an, object, s, appearance, blend, into, the, visual, background, as, the, potency, of, detection, and, interception, technologies, radar, infrared, search, and, tracking, surface, to, air, missiles, etc, have, increased, so, too, has, the, extent, to, which, the, design, and, operation, of, military, personnel, and, vehicles, have, been, affected, in, response, some, military, uniforms, are, treated, with, chemicals, to, reduce, their, infrared, signature, a, modern, stealth, vehicle, is, designed, from, the, outset, to, have, a, chosen, spectral, signature, the, degree, of, stealth, embodied, in, a, given, design, is, chosen, according, to, the, projected, threats, of, detection, camouflage, to, aid, or, avoid, predation, predates, humanity, and, hunters, have, been, using, vegetation, to, conceal, themselves, perhaps, as, long, as, people, have, been, hunting, the, earliest, application, of, camouflage, in, warfare, is, impossible, to, ascertain, methods, for, visual, concealment, in, war, were, documented, by, sun, tzu, in, his, book, the, art, of, war, in, the, 5th, century, bc, and, by, frontinus, in, his, work, strategemata, in, the, 1st, century, ad, in, england, irregular, units, of, gamekeepers, in, the, 17th, century, were, the, first, to, adopt, drab, colours, common, in, 16th, century, irish, units, as, a, form, of, camouflage, following, examples, from, the, continent, during, world, war, i, the, germans, experimented, with, the, use, of, cellon, cellulose, acetate, a, transparent, covering, material, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, visibility, of, military, aircraft, single, examples, of, the, fokker, e, iii, eindecker, fighter, monoplane, the, albatros, c, i, two, seat, observation, biplane, and, the, linke, hofmann, r, i, prototype, heavy, bomber, were, covered, with, cellon, however, sunlight, glinting, from, the, material, made, the, aircraft, even, more, visible, cellon, was, also, found, to, degrade, quickly, from, both, sunlight, and, in, flight, temperature, changes, so, the, effort, to, make, transparent, aircraft, ceased, in, 1916, the, british, modified, a, small, ss, class, airship, for, the, purpose, of, night, time, reconnaissance, over, german, lines, on, the, western, front, fitted, with, a, silenced, engine, and, a, black, gas, bag, the, craft, was, both, invisible, and, inaudible, from, the, ground, but, several, night, time, flights, over, german, held, territory, produced, little, useful, intelligence, and, the, idea, was, dropped, diffused, lighting, camouflage, a, shipborne, form, of, counter, illumination, camouflage, was, trialled, by, the, royal, canadian, navy, from, 1941, to, 1943, the, concept, was, followed, up, for, aircraft, by, the, americans, and, the, british, in, 1945, a, grumman, avenger, with, yehudi, lights, reached, 3, 000, yards, 2, 700, m, from, a, ship, before, being, sighted, this, ability, was, rendered, obsolete, by, radar, chaff, was, invented, in, britain, and, germany, early, in, world, war, ii, as, a, means, to, hide, aircraft, from, radar, in, effect, chaff, acted, upon, radio, waves, much, as, a, smoke, screen, acted, upon, visible, light, the, u, boat, u, 480, may, have, been, the, first, stealth, submarine, it, featured, an, anechoic, tile, rubber, coating, one, layer, of, which, contained, circular, air, pockets, to, defeat, asdic, sonar, radar, absorbent, paints, and, materials, of, rubber, and, semiconductor, composites, codenames, sumpf, schornsteinfeger, were, used, by, the, kriegsmarine, on, submarines, in, world, war, ii, tests, showed, they, were, effective, in, reducing, radar, signatures, at, both, short, centimetres, and, long, 1, 5, metre, wavelengths, in, 1956, the, cia, began, attempts, to, reduce, the, radar, cross, section, rcs, of, the, u, 2, spyplane, three, systems, were, developed, trapeze, a, series, of, wires, and, ferrite, beads, around, the, planform, of, the, aircraft, a, covering, material, with, pcb, circuitry, embedded, in, it, and, radar, absorbent, paint, these, were, deployed, in, the, field, on, the, so, called, dirty, birds, but, results, were, disappointing, the, weight, and, drag, increases, were, not, worth, any, reduction, in, detection, rates, more, successful, was, applying, camouflage, paint, to, the, originally, bare, metal, aircraft, a, deep, blue, was, found, to, be, most, effective, the, weight, of, this, cost, 250, ft, in, maximum, altitude, but, made, the, aircraft, harder, for, interceptors, to, see, in, 1958, the, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, requested, funding, for, a, reconnaissance, aircraft, to, replace, the, existing, u, 2, spy, planes, and, lockheed, secured, contractual, rights, to, produce, it, kelly, johnson, and, his, team, at, lockheed, s, skunk, works, were, assigned, to, produce, the, a, 12, or, oxcart, which, operated, at, high, altitude, of, 70, 000, to, 80, 000, ft, 21, 000, to, 24, 000, m, and, speed, of, mach, 3, 2, 2, 400, mph, 3, 800, km, h, to, avoid, radar, detection, various, plane, shapes, designed, to, reduce, radar, detection, were, developed, in, earlier, prototypes, named, a, 1, to, a, 11, the, a, 12, included, a, number, of, stealthy, features, including, special, fuel, to, reduce, the, signature, of, the, exhaust, plume, canted, vertical, stabilizers, the, use, of, composite, materials, in, key, locations, and, the, overall, finish, in, radar, absorbent, paint, in, 1960, the, usaf, reduced, the, radar, cross, section, of, a, ryan, q, 2c, firebee, drone, this, was, achieved, through, specially, designed, screens, over, the, air, intake, and, radiation, absorbent, material, on, the, fuselage, and, radar, absorbent, paint, the, united, states, army, issued, a, specification, in, 1968, which, called, for, an, observation, aircraft, that, would, be, acoustically, undetectable, from, the, ground, when, flying, at, an, altitude, of, 1, 500, ft, 460, m, at, night, this, resulted, in, the, lockheed, yo, 3a, quiet, star, which, operated, in, south, vietnam, from, late, june, 1970, to, september, 1971, during, the, 1970s, the, u, s, department, of, defense, launched, project, lockheed, have, blue, with, the, aim, of, developing, a, stealth, fighter, there, was, fierce, bidding, between, lockheed, and, northrop, to, secure, the, multibillion, dollar, contract, lockheed, incorporated, into, its, bid, a, text, written, by, the, soviet, russian, physicist, pyotr, ufimtsev, from, 1962, titled, method, of, edge, waves, in, the, physical, theory, of, diffraction, soviet, radio, moscow, 1962, in, 1971, this, book, was, translated, into, english, with, the, same, title, by, u, s, air, force, foreign, technology, division, the, theory, played, a, critical, role, in, the, design, of, american, stealth, aircraft, f, 117, and, b, 2, equations, outlined, in, the, paper, quantified, how, a, plane, s, shape, would, affect, its, detectability, by, radar, termed, radar, cross, section, rcs, at, the, time, the, soviet, union, did, not, have, supercomputer, capacity, to, solve, these, equations, for, actual, designs, this, was, applied, by, lockheed, in, computer, simulation, to, design, a, novel, shape, they, called, the, hopeless, diamond, a, wordplay, on, the, hope, diamond, securing, contractual, rights, to, produce, the, f, 117, nighthawk, starting, in, 1975, in, 1977, lockheed, produced, two, 60, scale, models, under, the, have, blue, contract, the, have, blue, program, was, a, stealth, technology, demonstrator, that, lasted, from, 1976, to, 1979, the, northrop, grumman, tacit, blue, also, played, a, part, in, the, development, of, composite, material, and, curvilinear, surfaces, low, observables, fly, by, wire, and, other, stealth, technology, innovations, the, success, of, have, blue, led, the, air, force, to, create, the, senior, trend, program, which, developed, the, f, 117, stealth, technology, or, lo, for, low, observability, is, not, one, technology, it, is, a, set, of, technologies, used, in, combinations, that, can, greatly, reduce, the, distances, at, which, a, person, or, vehicle, can, be, detected, more, so, radar, cross, section, reductions, but, also, acoustic, thermal, and, other, aspects, almost, since, the, invention, of, radar, various, methods, have, been, tried, to, minimize, detection, rapid, development, of, radar, during, world, war, ii, led, to, equally, rapid, development, of, numerous, counter, radar, measures, during, the, period, a, notable, example, of, this, was, the, use, of, chaff, modern, methods, include, radar, jamming, and, deception, the, term, stealth, in, reference, to, reduced, radar, signature, aircraft, became, popular, during, the, late, eighties, when, the, lockheed, martin, f, 117, stealth, fighter, became, widely, known, the, first, large, scale, and, public, use, of, the, f, 117, was, during, the, gulf, war, in, 1991, however, f, 117a, stealth, fighters, were, used, for, the, first, time, in, combat, during, operation, just, cause, the, united, states, invasion, of, panama, in, 1989, the, possibility, of, designing, aircraft, in, such, a, manner, as, to, reduce, their, radar, cross, section, was, recognized, in, the, late, 1930s, when, the, first, radar, tracking, systems, were, employed, and, it, has, been, known, since, at, least, the, 1960s, that, aircraft, shape, makes, a, significant, difference, in, detectability, the, avro, vulcan, a, british, bomber, of, the, 1960s, had, a, remarkably, small, appearance, on, radar, despite, its, large, size, and, occasionally, disappeared, from, radar, screens, entirely, it, is, now, known, that, it, had, a, fortuitously, stealthy, shape, apart, from, the, vertical, element, of, the, tail, despite, being, designed, before, a, low, radar, cross, section, rcs, and, other, stealth, factors, were, ever, a, consideration, a, royal, aircraft, establishment, technical, note, of, 1957, stated, that, of, all, the, aircraft, so, far, studied, the, vulcan, appeared, by, far, the, simplest, radar, echoing, object, due, to, its, shape, only, one, or, two, components, contributing, significantly, to, the, echo, at, any, aspect, one, of, them, being, the, vertical, stabilizer, which, is, especially, relevant, for, side, aspect, rcs, compared, with, three, or, more, on, most, other, types, while, writing, about, radar, systems, authors, simon, kingsley, and, shaun, quegan, singled, out, the, vulcan, s, shape, as, acting, to, reduce, the, rcs, in, contrast, the, tupolev, 95, russian, long, range, bomber, nato, reporting, name, bear, was, conspicuous, on, radar, it, is, now, known, that, propellers, and, jet, turbine, blades, produce, a, bright, radar, image, the, bear, has, four, pairs, of, large, 18, foot, 5, 6, m, diameter, contra, rotating, propellers, another, important, factor, is, internal, construction, some, stealth, aircraft, have, skin, that, is, radar, transparent, or, absorbing, behind, which, are, structures, termed, reentrant, triangles, radar, waves, penetrating, the, skin, get, trapped, in, these, structures, reflecting, off, the, internal, faces, and, losing, energy, this, method, was, first, used, on, the, blackbird, series, a, 12, yf, 12a, lockheed, sr, 71, blackbird, the, most, efficient, way, to, reflect, radar, waves, back, to, the, emitting, radar, is, with, orthogonal, metal, plates, forming, a, corner, reflector, consisting, of, either, a, dihedral, two, plates, or, a, trihedral, three, orthogonal, plates, this, configuration, occurs, in, the, tail, of, a, conventional, aircraft, where, the, vertical, and, horizontal, components, of, the, tail, are, set, at, right, angles, stealth, aircraft, such, as, the, f, 117, use, a, different, arrangement, tilting, the, tail, surfaces, to, reduce, corner, reflections, formed, between, them, a, more, radical, method, is, to, omit, the, tail, as, in, the, b, 2, spirit, the, b, 2, s, clean, low, drag, flying, wing, configuration, gives, it, exceptional, range, and, reduces, its, radar, profile, the, flying, wing, design, most, closely, resembles, a, so, called, infinite, flat, plate, as, vertical, control, surfaces, dramatically, increase, rcs, the, perfect, stealth, shape, as, it, would, have, no, angles, to, reflect, back, radar, waves, in, addition, to, altering, the, tail, stealth, design, must, bury, the, engines, within, the, wing, or, fuselage, or, in, some, cases, where, stealth, is, applied, to, an, extant, aircraft, install, baffles, in, the, air, intakes, so, that, the, compressor, blades, are, not, visible, to, radar, a, stealthy, shape, must, be, devoid, of, complex, bumps, or, protrusions, of, any, kind, meaning, that, weapons, fuel, tanks, and, other, stores, must, not, be, carried, externally, any, stealthy, vehicle, becomes, un, stealthy, when, a, door, or, hatch, opens, parallel, alignment, of, edges, or, even, surfaces, is, also, often, used, in, stealth, designs, the, technique, involves, using, a, small, number, of, edge, orientations, in, the, shape, of, the, structure, for, example, on, the, f, 22a, raptor, the, leading, edges, of, the, wing, and, the, tail, planes, are, set, at, the, same, angle, other, smaller, structures, such, as, the, air, intake, bypass, doors, and, the, air, refueling, aperture, also, use, the, same, angles, the, effect, of, this, is, to, return, a, narrow, radar, signal, in, a, very, specific, direction, away, from, the, radar, emitter, rather, than, returning, a, diffuse, signal, detectable, at, many, angles, the, effect, is, sometimes, called, glitter, after, the, very, brief, signal, seen, when, the, reflected, beam, passes, across, a, detector, it, can, be, difficult, for, the, radar, operator, to, distinguish, between, a, glitter, event, and, a, digital, glitch, in, the, processing, system, stealth, airframes, sometimes, display, distinctive, serrations, on, some, exposed, edges, such, as, the, engine, ports, the, yf, 23, has, such, serrations, on, the, exhaust, ports, this, is, another, example, in, the, parallel, alignment, of, features, this, time, on, the, external, airframe, the, shaping, requirements, detracted, greatly, from, the, f, 117, s, aerodynamic, properties, it, is, inherently, unstable, and, cannot, be, flown, without, a, fly, by, wire, control, system, similarly, coating, the, cockpit, canopy, with, a, thin, film, transparent, conductor, vapor, deposited, gold, or, indium, tin, oxide, helps, to, reduce, the, aircraft, s, radar, profile, because, radar, waves, would, normally, enter, the, cockpit, reflect, off, objects, the, inside, of, a, cockpit, has, a, complex, shape, with, a, pilot, helmet, alone, forming, a, sizeable, return, and, possibly, return, to, the, radar, but, the, conductive, coating, creates, a, controlled, shape, that, deflects, the, incoming, radar, waves, away, from, the, radar, the, coating, is, thin, enough, that, it, has, no, adverse, effect, on, pilot, vision, ships, have, also, adopted, similar, methods, though, the, earlier, arleigh, burke, class, destroyer, incorporated, some, signature, reduction, features, the, norwegian, skjold, class, corvette, was, the, first, coastal, defence, and, the, french, la, fayette, class, frigate, the, first, ocean, going, stealth, ship, to, enter, service, other, examples, are, the, dutch, de, zeven, provinci, n, class, frigates, the, taiwanese, tuo, chiang, stealth, corvette, german, sachsen, class, frigates, the, swedish, visby, class, corvette, the, uss, san, antonio, amphibious, transport, dock, and, most, modern, warship, designs, dielectric, composite, materials, are, more, transparent, to, radar, whereas, electrically, conductive, materials, such, as, metals, and, carbon, fibers, reflect, electromagnetic, energy, incident, on, the, material, s, surface, composites, may, also, contain, ferrites, to, optimize, the, dielectric, and, magnetic, properties, of, a, material, for, its, application, radiation, absorbent, material, ram, often, as, paints, are, used, especially, on, the, edges, of, metal, surfaces, while, the, material, and, thickness, of, ram, coatings, can, vary, the, way, they, work, is, the, same, absorb, radiated, energy, from, a, ground, or, air, based, radar, station, into, the, coating, and, convert, it, to, heat, rather, than, reflect, it, back, current, technologies, include, dielectric, composites, and, metal, fibers, containing, ferrite, isotopes, ceramic, composite, coating, is, a, new, type, of, material, systems, which, can, sustain, at, higher, temperatures, with, better, sand, erosion, resistance, and, thermal, resistance, paint, comprises, depositing, pyramid, like, colonies, on, the, reflecting, superficies, with, the, gaps, filled, with, ferrite, based, ram, the, pyramidal, structure, deflects, the, incident, radar, energy, in, the, maze, of, ram, one, commonly, used, material, is, called, iron, ball, paint, it, contains, microscopic, iron, spheres, that, resonate, in, tune, with, incoming, radio, waves, and, dissipate, most, of, their, energy, as, heat, leaving, little, to, reflect, back, to, detectors, fss, are, planar, periodic, structures, that, behave, like, filters, to, electromagnetic, energy, the, considered, frequency, selective, surfaces, are, composed, of, conducting, patch, elements, pasted, on, the, ferrite, layer, fss, are, used, for, filtration, and, microwave, absorption, shaping, offers, far, fewer, stealth, advantages, against, low, frequency, radar, if, the, radar, wavelength, is, roughly, twice, the, size, of, the, target, a, half, wave, resonance, effect, can, still, generate, a, significant, return, however, low, frequency, radar, is, limited, by, lack, of, available, frequencies, many, are, heavily, used, by, other, systems, by, lack, of, accuracy, of, the, diffraction, limited, systems, given, their, long, wavelengths, and, by, the, radar, s, size, making, it, difficult, to, transport, a, long, wave, radar, may, detect, a, target, and, roughly, locate, it, but, not, provide, enough, information, to, identify, it, target, it, with, weapons, or, even, to, guide, a, fighter, to, it, stealth, aircraft, attempt, to, minimize, all, radar, reflections, but, are, specifically, designed, to, avoid, reflecting, radar, waves, back, in, the, direction, they, came, from, since, in, most, cases, a, radar, emitter, and, receiver, are, in, the, same, location, they, are, less, able, to, minimize, radar, reflections, in, other, directions, thus, detection, can, be, better, achieved, if, emitters, are, in, different, locations, from, receivers, one, emitter, separate, from, one, receiver, is, termed, bistatic, radar, one, or, more, emitters, separate, from, more, than, one, receiver, is, termed, multistatic, radar, proposals, exist, to, use, reflections, from, emitters, such, as, civilian, radio, transmitters, including, cellular, telephone, radio, towers, by, moore, s, law, the, processing, power, behind, radar, systems, is, rising, over, time, this, will, eventually, erode, the, ability, of, physical, stealth, to, hide, vehicles, synthetic, aperture, sidescan, radars, can, be, used, to, detect, the, location, and, heading, of, ships, from, their, wake, patterns, these, are, detectable, from, orbit, when, a, ship, moves, through, a, seaway, it, throws, up, a, cloud, of, spray, which, can, be, detected, by, radar, acoustic, stealth, plays, a, primary, role, for, submarines, and, ground, vehicles, submarines, use, extensive, rubber, mountings, to, isolate, damp, and, avoid, mechanical, noises, that, can, reveal, locations, to, underwater, passive, sonar, arrays, early, stealth, observation, aircraft, used, slow, turning, propellers, to, avoid, being, heard, by, enemy, troops, below, stealth, aircraft, that, stay, subsonic, can, avoid, being, tracked, by, sonic, boom, the, presence, of, supersonic, and, jet, powered, stealth, aircraft, such, as, the, sr, 71, blackbird, indicates, that, acoustic, signature, is, not, always, a, major, driver, in, aircraft, design, as, the, blackbird, relied, more, on, its, very, high, speed, and, altitude, one, method, to, reduce, helicopter, rotor, noise, is, modulated, blade, spacing, standard, rotor, blades, are, evenly, spaced, and, produce, greater, noise, at, a, given, frequency, and, its, harmonics, using, varied, spacing, between, the, blades, spreads, the, noise, or, acoustic, signature, of, the, rotor, over, a, greater, range, of, frequencies, the, simplest, technology, is, visual, camouflage, the, use, of, paint, or, other, materials, to, color, and, break, up, the, lines, of, a, vehicle, or, person, most, stealth, aircraft, use, matte, paint, and, dark, colors, and, operate, only, at, night, lately, interest, in, daylight, stealth, especially, by, the, usaf, has, emphasized, the, use, of, gray, paint, in, disruptive, schemes, and, it, is, assumed, that, yehudi, lights, could, be, used, in, the, future, to, hide, the, airframe, against, the, background, of, the, sky, including, at, night, aircraft, of, any, colour, appear, dark, or, as, a, sort, of, active, camouflage, the, original, b, 2, design, had, wing, tanks, for, a, contrail, inhibiting, chemical, alleged, by, some, to, be, chlorofluorosulfonic, acid, but, this, was, replaced, in, the, final, design, with, a, contrail, sensor, that, alerts, the, pilot, when, he, should, change, altitude, and, mission, planning, also, considers, altitudes, where, the, probability, of, their, formation, is, minimized, in, space, mirrored, surfaces, can, be, employed, to, reflect, views, of, empty, space, toward, known, or, suspected, observers, this, approach, is, compatible, with, several, radar, stealth, schemes, careful, control, of, the, orientation, of, the, satellite, relative, to, the, observers, is, essential, and, mistakes, can, lead, to, detectability, enhancement, rather, than, the, desired, reduction, an, exhaust, plume, contributes, a, significant, infrared, signature, one, means, to, reduce, ir, signature, is, to, have, a, non, circular, tail, pipe, a, slit, shape, to, minimize, the, exhaust, cross, sectional, area, and, maximize, the, mixing, of, hot, exhaust, with, cool, ambient, air, see, lockheed, f, 117, nighthawk, often, cool, air, is, deliberately, injected, into, the, exhaust, flow, to, boost, this, process, see, ryan, aqm, 91, firefly, and, northrop, grumman, b, 2, spirit, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, shows, how, this, results, in, less, energy, thermal, radiation, in, infrared, spectrum, being, released, and, thus, reduces, the, heat, signature, in, some, aircraft, the, jet, exhaust, is, vented, above, the, wing, surface, to, shield, it, from, observers, below, as, in, the, lockheed, f, 117, nighthawk, and, the, unstealthy, fairchild, republic, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, to, achieve, infrared, stealth, the, exhaust, gas, is, cooled, to, the, temperatures, where, the, brightest, wavelengths, it, radiates, are, absorbed, by, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, greatly, reducing, the, infrared, visibility, of, the, exhaust, plume, another, way, to, reduce, the, exhaust, temperature, is, to, circulate, coolant, fluids, such, as, fuel, inside, the, exhaust, pipe, where, the, fuel, tanks, serve, as, heat, sinks, cooled, by, the, flow, of, air, along, the, wings, ground, combat, includes, the, use, of, both, active, and, passive, infrared, sensors, thus, the, united, states, marine, corps, usmc, ground, combat, uniform, requirements, document, specifies, infrared, reflective, quality, standards, in, addition, to, reducing, infrared, and, acoustic, emissions, a, stealth, vehicle, must, avoid, radiating, any, other, detectable, energy, such, as, from, onboard, radars, communications, systems, or, rf, leakage, from, electronics, enclosures, the, f, 117, uses, passive, infrared, and, low, light, level, television, sensor, systems, to, aim, its, weapons, and, the, f, 22, raptor, has, an, advanced, lpi, radar, which, can, illuminate, enemy, aircraft, without, triggering, a, radar, warning, receiver, response, the, size, of, a, target, s, image, on, radar, is, measured, by, the, radar, cross, section, rcs, often, represented, by, the, symbol, and, expressed, in, square, meters, this, does, not, equal, geometric, area, a, perfectly, conducting, sphere, of, projected, cross, sectional, area, 1, m, 2, i, e, a, diameter, of, 1, 13, m, will, have, an, rcs, of, 1, m, 2, note, that, for, radar, wavelengths, much, less, than, the, diameter, of, the, sphere, rcs, is, independent, of, frequency, conversely, a, square, flat, plate, of, area, 1, m, 2, will, have, an, rcs, of, 4, a, 2, 2, where, a, area, wavelength, or, 13, 982, m, 2, at, 10, ghz, if, the, radar, is, perpendicular, to, the, flat, surface, at, off, normal, incident, angles, energy, is, reflected, away, from, the, receiver, reducing, the, rcs, modern, stealth, aircraft, are, said, to, have, an, rcs, comparable, with, small, birds, or, large, insects, though, this, varies, widely, depending, on, aircraft, and, radar, if, the, rcs, was, directly, related, to, the, target, s, cross, sectional, area, the, only, way, to, reduce, it, would, be, to, make, the, physical, profile, smaller, rather, by, reflecting, much, of, the, radiation, away, or, by, absorbing, it, the, target, achieves, a, smaller, radar, cross, section, stealthy, strike, aircraft, such, as, the, lockheed, f, 117, nighthawk, are, usually, used, against, heavily, defended, enemy, sites, such, as, command, and, control, centers, or, surface, to, air, missile, sam, batteries, enemy, radar, will, cover, the, airspace, around, these, sites, with, overlapping, coverage, making, undetected, entry, by, conventional, aircraft, nearly, impossible, stealthy, aircraft, can, also, be, detected, but, only, at, short, ranges, around, the, radars, for, a, stealthy, aircraft, there, are, substantial, gaps, in, the, radar, coverage, thus, a, stealthy, aircraft, flying, an, appropriate, route, can, remain, undetected, by, radar, even, if, a, stealth, aircraft, is, detected, fire, control, radars, operating, in, c, x, and, ku, bands, cannot, paint, for, missile, guidance, low, observable, lo, jets, except, at, very, close, ranges, many, ground, based, radars, exploit, doppler, filter, to, improve, sensitivity, to, objects, having, a, radial, velocity, component, relative, to, the, radar, mission, planners, use, their, knowledge, of, enemy, radar, locations, and, the, rcs, pattern, of, the, aircraft, to, design, a, flight, path, that, minimizes, radial, speed, while, presenting, the, lowest, rcs, aspects, of, the, aircraft, to, the, threat, radar, to, be, able, to, fly, these, safe, routes, it, is, necessary, to, understand, an, enemy, s, radar, coverage, see, electronic, intelligence, airborne, or, mobile, radar, systems, such, as, airborne, early, warning, and, control, aew, c, awacs, can, complicate, tactical, strategy, for, stealth, operation, after, the, invention, of, electromagnetic, metasurfaces, the, conventional, means, to, reduce, rcs, have, been, improved, significantly, as, mentioned, earlier, the, main, objective, in, purpose, shaping, is, to, redirect, scattered, waves, away, from, the, backscattered, direction, which, is, usually, the, source, however, this, usually, compromises, aerodynamic, performance, one, feasible, solution, which, has, extensively, been, explored, in, recent, time, is, to, use, metasurfaces, which, can, redirect, scattered, waves, without, altering, the, geometry, of, a, target, such, metasurfaces, can, primarily, be, classified, in, two, categories, i, checkerboard, metasurfaces, ii, gradient, index, metasurfaces, similarly, negative, index, metamaterials, are, artificial, structures, for, which, refractive, index, has, a, negative, value, for, some, frequency, range, such, as, in, microwave, infrared, or, possibly, optical, these, offer, another, way, to, reduce, detectability, and, may, provide, electromagnetic, near, invisibility, in, designed, wavelengths, plasma, stealth, is, a, phenomenon, proposed, to, use, ionized, gas, termed, a, plasma, to, reduce, rcs, of, vehicles, interactions, between, electromagnetic, radiation, and, ionized, gas, have, been, studied, extensively, for, many, purposes, including, concealing, vehicles, from, radar, various, methods, might, form, a, layer, or, cloud, of, plasma, around, a, vehicle, to, deflect, or, absorb, radar, from, simpler, electrostatic, to, radio, frequency, rf, more, complex, laser, discharges, but, these, may, be, difficult, in, practice, several, technology, research, and, development, efforts, exist, to, integrate, the, functions, of, aircraft, flight, control, systems, such, as, ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and, flaperons, into, wings, to, perform, the, aerodynamic, purpose, with, the, advantages, of, lower, rcs, for, stealth, via, simpler, geometries, and, lower, complexity, mechanically, simpler, fewer, or, no, moving, parts, or, surfaces, less, maintenance, and, lower, mass, cost, up, to, 50, less, drag, up, to, 15, less, during, use, and, inertia, for, faster, stronger, control, response, to, change, vehicle, orientation, to, reduce, detection, two, promising, approaches, are, flexible, wings, and, fluidics, in, flexible, wings, much, or, all, of, a, wing, surface, can, change, shape, in, flight, to, deflect, air, flow, adaptive, compliant, wings, are, a, military, and, commercial, effort, the, x, 53, active, aeroelastic, wing, was, a, us, air, force, boeing, and, nasa, effort, in, fluidics, fluid, injection, into, airflows, is, being, researched, for, use, in, aircraft, to, control, direction, in, two, ways, circulation, control, and, thrust, vectoring, in, both, larger, more, complex, mechanical, parts, are, replaced, by, smaller, simpler, lower, mass, fluidic, systems, in, which, larger, forces, in, fluids, are, diverted, by, smaller, jets, or, flows, of, fluid, intermittently, to, change, the, direction, of, vehicles, mechanical, control, surfaces, that, must, move, cause, an, important, part, of, aircraft, radar, cross, section, omitting, mechanical, control, surfaces, can, reduce, radar, returns, as, of, 2023, at, least, two, countries, are, known, to, be, researching, fluidic, control, in, britain, bae, systems, has, tested, two, fluidically, controlled, unmanned, aircraft, one, starting, in, 2010, named, demon, and, another, starting, in, 2017, named, magma, with, the, university, of, manchester, in, the, united, states, the, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, darpa, program, named, control, of, revolutionary, aircraft, with, novel, effectors, crane, seeks, to, design, build, and, flight, test, a, novel, x, plane, that, incorporates, active, flow, control, afc, as, a, primary, design, consideration, in, 2023, the, aircraft, received, its, official, designation, as, x, 65, in, january, 2024, construction, began, at, boeing, subsidiary, aurora, flight, sciences, according, to, darpa, the, aurora, x, 65, could, be, completed, and, unveiled, as, soon, as, early, 2025, with, the, first, flight, occurring, in, summer, 2025, in, circulation, control, near, the, trailing, edges, of, wings, aircraft, flight, control, systems, are, replaced, by, slots, which, emit, fluid, flows, navy, ships, worldwide, have, incorporated, signature, reduction, features, mostly, for, the, purpose, of, reducing, anti, ship, missile, detection, range, and, enhancing, countermeasure, effectiveness, rather, than, actual, detection, avoidance, such, ships, include
