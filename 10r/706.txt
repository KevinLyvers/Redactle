an, airport, is, an, aerodrome, with, extended, facilities, mostly, for, commercial, air, transport, airports, usually, consist, of, a, landing, area, which, comprises, an, aerially, accessible, open, space, including, at, least, one, operationally, active, surface, such, as, a, runway, for, a, plane, to, take, off, and, to, land, or, a, helipad, and, often, includes, adjacent, utility, buildings, such, as, control, towers, hangars, and, terminals, to, maintain, and, monitor, aircraft, larger, airports, may, have, airport, aprons, taxiway, bridges, air, traffic, control, centres, passenger, facilities, such, as, restaurants, and, lounges, and, emergency, services, in, some, countries, the, us, in, particular, airports, also, typically, have, one, or, more, fixed, base, operators, serving, general, aviation, airport, operations, are, extremely, complex, with, a, complicated, system, of, aircraft, support, services, passenger, services, and, aircraft, control, services, contained, within, the, operation, thus, airports, can, be, major, employers, as, well, as, important, hubs, for, tourism, and, other, kinds, of, transit, because, they, are, sites, of, operation, for, heavy, machinery, a, number, of, regulations, and, safety, measures, have, been, implemented, in, airports, in, order, to, reduce, hazards, additionally, airports, have, major, local, environmental, impacts, as, both, large, sources, of, air, pollution, noise, pollution, and, other, environmental, impacts, making, them, sites, that, acutely, experience, the, environmental, effects, of, aviation, airports, are, also, vulnerable, infrastructure, to, extreme, weather, climate, change, caused, sea, level, rise, and, other, disasters, the, terms, aerodrome, airfield, and, airstrip, also, refer, to, airports, and, the, terms, heliport, seaplane, base, and, stolport, refer, to, airports, dedicated, exclusively, to, helicopters, seaplanes, and, short, take, off, and, landing, aircraft, in, colloquial, use, in, certain, environments, the, terms, airport, and, aerodrome, are, often, interchanged, however, in, general, the, term, airport, may, imply, or, confer, a, certain, stature, upon, the, aviation, facility, that, other, aerodromes, may, not, have, achieved, in, some, jurisdictions, airport, is, a, legal, term, of, art, reserved, exclusively, for, those, aerodromes, certified, or, licensed, as, airports, by, the, relevant, civil, aviation, authority, after, meeting, specified, certification, criteria, or, regulatory, requirements, that, is, to, say, all, airports, are, aerodromes, but, not, all, aerodromes, are, airports, in, jurisdictions, where, there, is, no, legal, distinction, between, aerodrome, and, airport, which, term, to, use, in, the, name, of, an, aerodrome, may, be, a, commercial, decision, in, us, technical, legal, usage, landing, area, is, used, instead, of, aerodrome, and, airport, means, a, landing, area, used, regularly, by, aircraft, for, receiving, or, discharging, passengers, or, cargo, an, airport, solely, serving, helicopters, is, called, a, heliport, an, airport, for, use, by, seaplanes, and, amphibious, aircraft, is, called, a, seaplane, base, such, a, base, typically, includes, a, stretch, of, open, water, for, takeoffs, and, landings, and, seaplane, docks, for, tying, up, an, international, airport, has, additional, facilities, for, customs, and, passport, control, as, well, as, incorporating, all, the, aforementioned, elements, such, airports, rank, among, the, most, complex, and, largest, of, all, built, typologies, with, 15, of, the, top, 50, buildings, by, floor, area, being, airport, terminals, smaller, or, less, developed, airfields, which, represent, the, vast, majority, often, have, a, single, runway, shorter, than, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, larger, airports, for, airline, flights, generally, have, paved, runways, of, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, or, longer, skyline, airport, in, inkom, idaho, has, a, runway, that, is, only, 122, m, 400, ft, long, in, the, united, states, the, minimum, dimensions, for, dry, hard, landing, fields, are, defined, by, the, far, landing, and, takeoff, field, lengths, these, include, considerations, for, safety, margins, during, landing, and, takeoff, the, longest, public, use, runway, in, the, world, is, at, qamdo, bamda, airport, in, china, it, has, a, length, of, 5, 500, m, 18, 045, ft, the, world, s, widest, paved, runway, is, at, ulyanovsk, vostochny, airport, in, russia, and, is, 105, m, 344, ft, wide, as, of, 2009, the, cia, stated, that, there, were, approximately, 44, 000, airports, or, airfields, recognizable, from, the, air, around, the, world, including, 15, 095, in, the, us, the, us, having, the, most, in, the, world, most, of, the, world, s, large, airports, are, owned, by, local, regional, or, national, government, bodies, who, then, lease, the, airport, to, private, corporations, who, oversee, the, airport, s, operation, for, example, in, the, uk, the, state, owned, british, airports, authority, originally, operated, eight, of, the, nation, s, major, commercial, airports, it, was, subsequently, privatized, in, the, late, 1980s, and, following, its, takeover, by, the, spanish, ferrovial, consortium, in, 2006, has, been, further, divested, and, downsized, to, operating, just, heathrow, germany, s, frankfurt, airport, is, managed, by, the, quasi, private, firm, fraport, while, in, india, gmr, group, operates, through, joint, ventures, indira, gandhi, international, airport, and, rajiv, gandhi, international, airport, bengaluru, international, airport, is, controlled, by, fairfax, chhatrapati, shivaji, international, airport, chaudhary, charan, singh, international, airport, mangalore, international, airport, thiruvananthapuram, international, airport, lokpriya, gopinath, bordoloi, international, airport, jaipur, international, airport, sardar, vallabhbhai, patel, international, airport, are, operated, by, adani, group, through, a, public, private, partnership, wherein, adani, group, the, operator, pays, airports, authority, of, india, the, owner, of, the, airports, a, predetermined, sum, of, money, based, on, the, number, of, passengers, handled, by, the, airports, the, rest, of, india, s, airports, are, managed, by, the, airports, authority, of, india, in, pakistan, nearly, all, civilian, airports, are, owned, and, operated, by, the, pakistan, civil, aviation, authority, except, for, sialkot, international, airport, which, has, the, distinction, of, being, the, first, privately, owned, public, airport, in, pakistan, and, south, asia, in, the, us, commercial, airports, are, generally, operated, directly, by, government, entities, or, government, created, airport, authorities, also, known, as, port, authorities, such, as, the, los, angeles, world, airports, authority, that, oversees, several, airports, in, the, greater, los, angeles, area, including, los, angeles, international, airport, in, canada, the, federal, authority, transport, canada, divested, itself, of, all, but, the, remotest, airports, in, 1999, 2000, now, most, airports, in, canada, are, operated, by, individual, legal, authorities, such, as, vancouver, international, airport, authority, although, still, owned, by, transport, canada, some, airports, such, as, boundary, bay, airport, and, pitt, meadows, airport, are, municipally, owned, many, us, airports, still, lease, part, or, all, of, their, facilities, to, outside, firms, who, operate, functions, such, as, retail, management, and, parking, all, us, commercial, airport, runways, are, certified, by, the, faa, under, the, code, of, federal, regulations, title, 14, part, 139, certification, of, commercial, service, airports, but, maintained, by, the, local, airport, under, the, regulatory, authority, of, the, faa, despite, the, reluctance, to, privatize, airports, in, the, us, contrary, to, the, faa, sponsoring, a, privatization, program, since, 1996, the, government, owned, contractor, operated, goco, arrangement, is, the, standard, for, the, operation, of, commercial, airports, in, the, rest, of, the, world, the, airport, airway, trust, fund, aatf, was, created, by, the, airport, and, airway, development, in, 1970, which, finances, aviation, programs, in, the, united, states, airport, improvement, program, aip, facilities, and, equipment, f, e, and, research, engineering, and, development, re, d, are, the, three, major, accounts, of, federal, aviation, administration, which, are, financed, by, the, aatf, as, well, as, pays, for, the, faa, s, operation, and, maintenance, o, m, account, the, funding, of, these, accounts, are, dependent, on, the, taxes, the, airports, generate, of, revenues, passenger, tickets, fuel, and, cargo, tax, are, the, taxes, that, are, paid, by, the, passengers, and, airlines, help, fund, these, accounts, airports, revenues, are, divided, into, three, major, parts, aeronautical, revenue, non, aeronautical, revenue, and, non, operating, revenue, aeronautical, revenue, makes, up, 50, in, 2021, from, 54, and, 48, in, 2019, and, 2020, non, aeronautical, revenue, makes, up, 34, 40, 39, in, previous, years, and, non, operating, revenue, makes, up, 16, 6, 14, of, the, total, revenue, of, airports, aeronautical, revenue, are, generated, through, airline, rents, and, landing, passenger, service, parking, and, hangar, fees, landing, fees, are, charged, per, aircraft, for, landing, an, airplane, in, the, airport, property, landing, fees, are, calculated, through, the, landing, weight, and, the, size, of, the, aircraft, which, varies, but, most, of, the, airports, have, a, fixed, rate, and, a, charge, extra, for, extra, weight, passenger, service, fees, are, charges, per, passengers, for, the, facilities, used, on, a, flight, like, water, food, wifi, and, shows, which, is, paid, while, paying, for, an, airline, ticket, aircraft, parking, is, also, a, major, revenue, source, for, airports, aircraft, are, parked, for, a, certain, amount, of, time, before, or, after, takeoff, and, have, to, pay, to, park, there, every, airport, has, its, own, rates, of, parking, for, example, john, f, kennedy, airport, in, new, york, city, charges, 45, per, hour, for, a, plane, of, 100, 000, pounds, and, the, price, increases, with, weight, non, aeronautical, revenue, is, gained, through, things, other, than, aircraft, operations, it, includes, lease, revenue, from, compatible, land, use, development, non, aeronautical, building, leases, retail, and, concession, sales, rental, car, operations, parking, and, in, airport, advertising, concession, revenue, is, one, big, part, of, non, aeronautical, revenue, airports, makes, through, duty, free, bookstores, restaurants, and, money, exchange, car, parking, is, a, growing, source, of, revenue, for, airports, as, more, people, use, the, parking, facilities, of, the, airport, o, hare, international, airport, in, chicago, charges, 2, per, hour, for, every, car, many, airports, are, local, monopolies, to, prevent, them, from, abusing, their, market, power, governments, regulate, how, much, airports, may, charge, to, airlines, using, price, cap, regulation, airports, are, divided, into, landside, and, airside, zones, the, landside, is, subject, to, fewer, special, laws, and, is, part, of, the, public, realm, while, access, to, the, airside, zone, is, tightly, controlled, landside, facilities, may, include, publicly, accessible, airport, check, in, desks, shops, and, ground, transportation, facilities, the, airside, area, includes, all, parts, of, the, airport, around, the, aircraft, and, the, parts, of, the, buildings, that, are, restricted, to, staff, and, sections, of, these, extended, to, travelling, airside, shopping, dining, or, waiting, passengers, depending, on, the, airport, passengers, and, staff, must, be, checked, by, security, or, border, control, before, being, permitted, to, enter, the, airside, zone, conversely, passengers, arriving, from, an, international, flight, must, pass, through, border, control, and, customs, to, access, the, landside, area, in, which, they, exit, unless, in, airside, transit, most, multi, terminal, airports, have, variously, termed, flight, passenger, air, connections, buses, moving, walkways, and, or, people, movers, for, inter, terminal, airside, transit, their, airlines, can, arrange, for, baggage, to, be, routed, directly, to, the, passenger, s, destination, most, major, airports, issue, a, secure, keycard, an, airside, pass, to, employees, to, assist, in, their, reliable, standardized, and, efficient, verification, of, identity, a, terminal, is, a, building, with, passenger, facilities, small, airports, have, one, terminal, large, ones, often, have, multiple, terminals, though, some, large, airports, like, amsterdam, airport, schiphol, still, have, one, terminal, the, terminal, has, a, series, of, gates, which, provide, passengers, with, access, to, the, plane, the, following, facilities, are, essential, for, departing, passengers, the, following, facilities, are, essential, for, arriving, passengers, for, both, sets, of, passengers, there, must, be, a, link, between, the, passenger, facilities, and, the, aircraft, such, as, jet, bridges, or, airstairs, there, also, needs, to, be, a, baggage, handling, system, to, transport, baggage, from, the, baggage, drop, off, to, departing, planes, and, from, arriving, planes, to, the, baggage, reclaim, the, area, where, the, aircraft, parks, to, load, passengers, and, baggage, is, known, as, an, apron, or, ramp, or, incorrectly, the, tarmac, airports, with, international, flights, have, customs, and, immigration, facilities, however, as, some, countries, have, agreements, that, allow, travel, between, them, without, customs, and, immigrations, such, facilities, are, not, a, definitive, need, for, an, international, airport, international, flights, often, require, a, higher, level, of, physical, security, although, in, recent, years, many, countries, have, adopted, the, same, level, of, security, for, international, and, domestic, travel, floating, airports, are, being, designed, which, could, be, located, out, at, sea, and, which, would, use, designs, such, as, pneumatic, stabilized, platform, technology, airport, security, normally, requires, baggage, checks, metal, screenings, of, individual, persons, and, rules, against, any, object, that, could, be, used, as, a, weapon, since, the, september, 11, attacks, and, the, real, id, act, of, 2005, airport, security, has, dramatically, increased, and, gotten, tighter, and, stricter, than, ever, before, most, major, airports, provide, commercial, outlets, for, products, and, services, most, of, these, companies, many, of, which, are, internationally, known, brands, are, located, within, the, departure, areas, these, include, clothing, boutiques, and, restaurants, and, in, the, us, amounted, to, 4, 2, billion, in, 2015, prices, charged, for, items, sold, at, these, outlets, are, generally, higher, than, those, outside, the, airport, however, some, airports, now, regulate, costs, to, keep, them, comparable, to, street, prices, this, term, is, misleading, as, prices, often, match, the, manufacturers, suggested, retail, price, msrp, but, are, almost, never, discounted, many, new, airports, include, walkthrough, duty, free, stores, that, require, air, passengers, to, enter, a, retail, store, upon, exiting, security, airport, planners, sometimes, incorporate, winding, routes, within, these, stores, such, that, passengers, encounter, more, goods, as, they, walk, towards, their, gate, planners, also, install, artworks, next, to, the, airport, s, shops, in, order, to, draw, passengers, into, the, stores, apart, from, major, fast, food, chains, some, airport, restaurants, offer, regional, cuisine, specialties, for, those, in, transit, so, that, they, may, sample, local, food, without, leaving, the, airport, some, airport, structures, include, on, site, hotels, built, within, or, attached, to, a, terminal, building, airport, hotels, have, grown, popular, due, to, their, convenience, for, transient, passengers, and, easy, accessibility, to, the, airport, terminal, many, airport, hotels, also, have, agreements, with, airlines, to, provide, overnight, lodging, for, displaced, passengers, major, airports, in, such, countries, as, russia, and, japan, offer, miniature, sleeping, units, within, the, airport, that, are, available, for, rent, by, the, hour, the, smallest, type, is, the, capsule, hotel, popular, in, japan, a, slightly, larger, variety, is, known, as, a, sleep, box, an, even, larger, type, is, provided, by, the, company, yotel, some, airports, provide, smoking, areas, and, prayer, areas, airports, may, also, contain, premium, and, vip, services, the, premium, and, vip, services, may, include, express, check, in, and, dedicated, check, in, counters, these, services, are, usually, reserved, for, first, and, business, class, passengers, premium, frequent, flyers, and, members, of, the, airline, s, clubs, premium, services, may, sometimes, be, open, to, passengers, who, are, members, of, a, different, airline, s, frequent, flyer, program, this, can, sometimes, be, part, of, a, reciprocal, deal, as, when, multiple, airlines, are, part, of, the, same, alliance, or, as, a, ploy, to, attract, premium, customers, away, from, rival, airlines, sometimes, these, premium, services, will, be, offered, to, a, non, premium, passenger, if, the, airline, has, made, a, mistake, in, handling, of, the, passenger, such, as, unreasonable, delays, or, mishandling, of, checked, baggage, airline, lounges, frequently, offer, free, or, reduced, cost, food, as, well, as, alcoholic, and, non, alcoholic, beverages, lounges, themselves, typically, have, seating, showers, quiet, areas, televisions, computer, wi, fi, and, internet, access, and, power, outlets, that, passengers, may, use, for, their, electronic, equipment, some, airline, lounges, employ, baristas, bartenders, and, gourmet, chefs, airlines, sometimes, operate, multiple, lounges, within, the, one, airport, terminal, allowing, ultra, premium, customers, such, as, first, class, customers, additional, services, which, are, not, available, to, other, premium, customers, multiple, lounges, may, also, prevent, overcrowding, of, the, lounge, facilities, in, addition, to, people, airports, move, cargo, around, the, clock, cargo, airlines, often, have, their, own, on, site, and, adjacent, infrastructure, to, transfer, parcels, between, ground, and, air, cargo, terminal, facilities, are, areas, where, international, airports, export, cargo, has, to, be, stored, after, customs, clearance, and, prior, to, loading, the, aircraft, similarly, import, cargo, that, is, offloaded, needs, to, be, in, bond, before, the, consignee, decides, to, take, delivery, areas, have, to, be, kept, aside, for, examination, of, export, and, import, cargo, by, the, airport, authorities, designated, areas, or, sheds, may, be, given, to, airlines, or, freight, forward, ring, agencies, every, cargo, terminal, has, a, landside, and, an, airside, the, landside, is, where, the, exporters, and, importers, through, either, their, agents, or, by, themselves, deliver, or, collect, shipments, while, the, airside, is, where, loads, are, moved, to, or, from, the, aircraft, in, addition, cargo, terminals, are, divided, into, distinct, areas, export, import, and, interline, or, transshipment, airports, require, parking, lots, for, passengers, who, may, leave, the, cars, at, the, airport, for, a, long, period, of, time, large, airports, will, also, have, car, rental, firms, taxi, ranks, bus, stops, and, sometimes, a, train, station, many, large, airports, are, located, near, railway, trunk, routes, for, seamless, connection, of, multimodal, transport, for, instance, frankfurt, airport, amsterdam, airport, schiphol, london, heathrow, airport, tokyo, haneda, airport, tokyo, narita, airport, hamad, international, airport, london, gatwick, airport, and, london, stansted, airport, it, is, also, common, to, connect, an, airport, and, a, city, with, rapid, transit, light, rail, lines, or, other, non, road, public, transport, systems, some, examples, of, this, would, include, the, airtrain, jfk, at, john, f, kennedy, international, airport, in, new, york, link, light, rail, that, runs, from, the, heart, of, downtown, seattle, to, seattle, tacoma, international, airport, and, the, silver, line, t, at, boston, s, logan, international, airport, by, the, massachusetts, bay, transportation, authority, mbta, such, a, connection, lowers, risk, of, missed, flights, due, to, traffic, congestion, large, airports, usually, have, access, also, through, controlled, access, highways, freeways, or, motorways, from, which, motor, vehicles, enter, either, the, departure, loop, or, the, arrival, loop, the, distances, passengers, need, to, move, within, a, large, airport, can, be, substantial, it, is, common, for, airports, to, provide, moving, walkways, buses, and, rail, transport, systems, some, airports, like, hartsfield, jackson, atlanta, international, airport, and, london, stansted, airport, have, a, transit, system, that, connects, some, of, the, gates, to, a, main, terminal, airports, with, more, than, one, terminal, have, a, transit, system, to, connect, the, terminals, together, such, as, john, f, kennedy, international, airport, mexico, city, international, airport, and, london, gatwick, airport, airport, operations, are, made, possible, by, an, organized, network, of, trained, personnel, specialized, equipment, and, spatial, data, after, thousands, of, ground, operations, staff, left, the, industry, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, there, have, been, discussions, on, the, need, for, systemic, improvements, in, three, primary, areas, the, surfaces, where, ground, operations, occur, are, generally, divided, into, three, regions, runways, taxiways, and, aprons, air, traffic, control, atc, is, the, task, of, managing, aircraft, movements, and, making, sure, they, are, safe, orderly, and, expeditious, at, the, largest, airports, air, traffic, control, is, a, series, of, highly, complex, operations, that, requires, managing, frequent, traffic, that, moves, in, all, three, dimensions, a, towered, or, controlled, airport, has, a, control, tower, where, the, air, traffic, controllers, are, based, pilots, are, required, to, maintain, two, way, radio, communication, with, the, controllers, and, to, acknowledge, and, comply, with, their, instructions, a, non, towered, airport, has, no, operating, control, tower, and, therefore, two, way, radio, communications, are, not, required, though, it, is, good, operating, practice, for, pilots, to, transmit, their, intentions, on, the, airport, s, common, traffic, advisory, frequency, ctaf, for, the, benefit, of, other, aircraft, in, the, area, the, ctaf, may, be, a, universal, integrated, community, unicom, multicom, flight, service, station, fss, or, tower, frequency, the, majority, of, the, world, s, airports, are, small, facilities, without, a, tower, not, all, towered, airports, have, 24, 7, atc, operations, in, those, cases, non, towered, procedures, apply, when, the, tower, is, not, in, use, such, as, at, night, non, towered, airports, come, under, area, en, route, control, remote, and, virtual, tower, rvt, is, a, system, in, which, atc, is, handled, by, controllers, who, are, not, present, at, the, airport, itself, air, traffic, control, responsibilities, at, airports, are, usually, divided, into, at, least, two, main, areas, ground, and, tower, though, a, single, controller, may, work, both, stations, the, busiest, airports, may, subdivide, responsibilities, further, with, clearance, delivery, apron, control, and, or, other, specialized, atc, stations, ground, control, is, responsible, for, directing, all, ground, traffic, in, designated, movement, areas, except, the, traffic, on, runways, this, includes, planes, baggage, trains, snowplows, grass, cutters, fuel, trucks, stair, trucks, airline, food, trucks, conveyor, belt, vehicles, and, other, vehicles, ground, control, will, instruct, these, vehicles, on, which, taxiways, to, use, which, runway, they, will, use, in, the, case, of, planes, where, they, will, park, and, when, it, is, safe, to, cross, runways, when, a, plane, is, ready, to, takeoff, it, will, be, turned, over, to, tower, control, conversely, after, a, plane, has, landed, it, will, depart, the, runway, and, be, handed, over, from, tower, to, ground, control, tower, control, is, responsible, for, aircraft, on, the, runway, and, in, the, controlled, airspace, immediately, surrounding, the, airport, tower, controllers, may, use, radar, to, locate, an, aircraft, s, position, in, 3d, space, or, they, may, rely, on, pilot, position, reports, and, visual, observation, they, coordinate, the, sequencing, of, aircraft, in, the, traffic, pattern, and, direct, aircraft, on, how, to, safely, join, and, leave, the, circuit, aircraft, which, are, only, passing, through, the, airspace, must, also, contact, tower, control, to, be, sure, they, remain, clear, of, other, traffic, at, all, airports, the, use, of, a, traffic, pattern, often, called, a, traffic, circuit, outside, the, us, is, possible, they, may, help, to, assure, smooth, traffic, flow, between, departing, and, arriving, aircraft, there, is, no, technical, need, within, modern, commercial, aviation, for, performing, this, pattern, provided, there, is, no, queue, and, due, to, the, so, called, slot, times, the, overall, traffic, planning, tend, to, assure, landing, queues, are, avoided, if, for, instance, an, aircraft, approaches, runway, 17, which, has, a, heading, of, approx, 170, degrees, from, the, north, coming, from, 360, 0, degrees, heading, towards, 180, degrees, the, aircraft, will, land, as, fast, as, possible, by, just, turning, 10, degrees, and, follow, the, glidepath, without, orbit, the, runway, for, visual, reasons, whenever, this, is, possible, for, smaller, piston, engined, airplanes, at, smaller, airfields, without, ils, equipment, things, are, very, different, though, generally, this, pattern, is, a, circuit, consisting, of, five, legs, that, form, a, rectangle, two, legs, and, the, runway, form, one, side, with, the, remaining, legs, forming, three, more, sides, each, leg, is, named, see, diagram, and, atc, directs, pilots, on, how, to, join, and, leave, the, circuit, traffic, patterns, are, flown, at, one, specific, altitude, usually, 800, or, 1, 000, ft, 244, or, 305, m, above, ground, level, agl, standard, traffic, patterns, are, left, handed, meaning, all, turns, are, made, to, the, left, one, of, the, main, reason, for, this, is, that, pilots, sit, on, the, left, side, of, the, airplane, and, a, left, hand, patterns, improves, their, visibility, of, the, airport, and, pattern, right, handed, patterns, do, exist, usually, because, of, obstacles, such, as, a, mountain, or, to, reduce, noise, for, local, residents, the, predetermined, circuit, helps, traffic, flow, smoothly, because, all, pilots, know, what, to, expect, and, helps, reduce, the, chance, of, a, mid, air, collision, at, controlled, airports, a, circuit, can, be, in, place, but, is, not, normally, used, rather, aircraft, usually, only, commercial, with, long, routes, request, approach, clearance, while, they, are, still, hours, away, from, the, airport, the, destination, airport, can, then, plan, a, queue, of, arrivals, and, planes, will, be, guided, into, one, queue, per, active, runway, for, a, straight, in, approach, while, this, system, keeps, the, airspace, free, and, is, simpler, for, pilots, it, requires, detailed, knowledge, of, how, aircraft, are, planning, to, use, the, airport, ahead, of, time, and, is, therefore, only, possible, with, large, commercial, airliners, on, pre, scheduled, flights, the, system, has, recently, become, so, advanced, that, controllers, can, predict, whether, an, aircraft, will, be, delayed, on, landing, before, it, even, takes, off, that, aircraft, can, then, be, delayed, on, the, ground, rather, than, wasting, expensive, fuel, waiting, in, the, air, there, are, a, number, of, aids, both, visual, and, electronic, though, not, at, all, airports, a, visual, approach, slope, indicator, vasi, helps, pilots, fly, the, approach, for, landing, some, airports, are, equipped, with, a, vhf, omnidirectional, range, vor, to, help, pilots, find, the, direction, to, the, airport, vors, are, often, accompanied, by, a, distance, measuring, equipment, dme, to, determine, the, distance, to, the, vor, vors, are, also, located, off, airports, where, they, serve, to, provide, airways, for, aircraft, to, navigate, upon, in, poor, weather, pilots, will, use, an, instrument, landing, system, ils, to, find, the, runway, and, fly, the, correct, approach, even, if, they, cannot, see, the, ground, the, number, of, instrument, approaches, based, on, the, use, of, the, global, positioning, system, gps, is, rapidly, increasing, and, may, eventually, become, the, primary, means, for, instrument, landings, larger, airports, sometimes, offer, precision, approach, radar, par, but, these, systems, are, more, common, at, military, air, bases, than, civilian, airports, the, aircraft, s, horizontal, and, vertical, movement, is, tracked, via, radar, and, the, controller, tells, the, pilot, his, position, relative, to, the, approach, slope, once, the, pilots, can, see, the, runway, lights, they, may, continue, with, a, visual, landing, airport, guidance, signs, provide, direction, and, information, to, taxiing, aircraft, and, airport, vehicles, smaller, aerodromes, may, have, few, or, no, signs, relying, instead, on, diagrams, and, charts, many, airports, have, lighting, that, help, guide, planes, using, the, runways, and, taxiways, at, night, or, in, rain, or, fog, on, runways, green, lights, indicate, the, beginning, of, the, runway, for, landing, while, red, lights, indicate, the, end, of, the, runway, runway, edge, lighting, consists, of, white, lights, spaced, out, on, both, sides, of, the, runway, indicating, the, edges, some, airports, have, more, complicated, lighting, on, the, runways, including, lights, that, run, down, the, centerline, of, the, runway, and, lights, that, help, indicate, the, approach, an, approach, lighting, system, or, als, low, traffic, airports, may, use, pilot, controlled, lighting, to, save, electricity, and, staffing, costs, along, taxiways, blue, lights, indicate, the, taxiway, s, edge, and, some, airports, have, embedded, green, lights, that, indicate, the, centerline, weather, observations, at, the, airport, are, crucial, to, safe, takeoffs, and, landings, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, vast, majority, of, airports, large, and, small, will, either, have, some, form, of, automated, airport, weather, station, whether, an, awos, asos, or, awss, a, human, observer, or, a, combination, of, the, two, these, weather, observations, predominantly, in, the, metar, format, are, available, over, the, radio, through, automatic, terminal, information, service, atis, via, the, atc, or, the, flight, service, station, planes, take, off, and, land, into, the, wind, to, achieve, maximum, performance, because, pilots, need, instantaneous, information, during, landing, a, windsock, can, also, be, kept, in, view, of, the, runway, aviation, windsocks, are, made, with, lightweight, material, withstand, strong, winds, and, some, are, lit, up, after, dark, or, in, foggy, weather, because, visibility, of, windsocks, is, limited, often, multiple, glow, orange, windsocks, are, placed, on, both, sides, of, the, runway, most, airports, have, groundcrew, handling, the, loading, and, unloading, of, passengers, crew, baggage, and, other, services, some, groundcrew, are, linked, to, specific, airlines, among, the, vehicles, that, serve, an, airliner, on, the, ground, are, the, length, of, time, an, aircraft, remains, on, the, ground, in, between, consecutive, flights, is, known, as, turnaround, time, airlines, seek, to, minimize, turnaround, times, with, times, scheduled, as, low, as, 25, minutes, like, industrial, equipment, or, facility, management, airports, require, tailor, made, maintenance, management, due, to, their, complexity, with, many, tangible, assets, spread, over, a, large, area, in, different, environments, these, infrastructures, must, therefore, effectively, monitor, these, assets, and, store, spare, parts, to, maintain, them, at, an, optimal, level, of, service, to, manage, these, airport, assets, several, solutions, are, competing, for, the, market, cmms, computerized, maintenance, management, system, predominate, and, mainly, enable, a, company, s, maintenance, activity, to, be, monitored, planned, recorded, and, rationalized, aviation, safety, is, an, important, concern, in, the, operation, of, an, airport, and, almost, every, airfield, includes, equipment, and, procedures, for, handling, emergency, situations, airport, crash, tender, crews, are, equipped, for, dealing, with, airfield, accidents, crew, and, passenger, extractions, and, the, hazards, of, highly, flammable, aviation, fuel, the, crews, are, also, trained, to, deal, with, situations, such, as, bomb, threats, hijacking, and, terrorist, activities, hazards, to, aircraft, include, debris, nesting, birds, and, reduced, friction, levels, due, to, environmental, conditions, such, as, ice, snow, or, rain, part, of, runway, maintenance, is, airfield, rubber, removal, which, helps, maintain, friction, levels, the, fields, must, be, kept, clear, of, debris, using, cleaning, equipment, so, that, loose, material, does, not, become, a, projectile, and, enter, an, engine, duct, see, foreign, object, damage, in, adverse, weather, conditions, ice, and, snow, clearing, equipment, can, be, used, to, improve, traction, on, the, landing, strip, for, waiting, aircraft, equipment, is, used, to, spray, special, deicing, fluids, on, the, wings, many, airports, are, built, near, open, fields, or, wetlands, these, tend, to, attract, bird, populations, which, can, pose, a, hazard, to, aircraft, in, the, form, of, bird, strikes, airport, crews, often, need, to, discourage, birds, from, taking, up, residence, some, airports, are, located, next, to, parks, golf, courses, or, other, low, density, uses, of, land, other, airports, are, located, near, densely, populated, urban, or, suburban, areas, an, airport, can, have, areas, where, collisions, between, aircraft, on, the, ground, tend, to, occur, records, are, kept, of, any, incursions, where, aircraft, or, vehicles, are, in, an, inappropriate, location, allowing, these, hot, spots, to, be, identified, these, locations, then, undergo, special, attention, by, transportation, authorities, such, as, the, faa, in, the, us, and, airport, administrators, during, the, 1980s, a, phenomenon, known, as, microburst, became, a, growing, concern, due, to, aircraft, accidents, caused, by, microburst, wind, shear, such, as, delta, air, lines, flight, 191, microburst, radar, was, developed, as, an, aid, to, safety, during, landing, giving, two, to, five, minutes, warning, to, aircraft, in, the, vicinity, of, the, field, of, a, microburst, event, some, airfields, now, have, a, special, surface, known, as, soft, concrete, at, the, end, of, the, runway, stopway, or, blastpad, that, behaves, somewhat, like, styrofoam, bringing, the, plane, to, a, relatively, rapid, halt, as, the, material, disintegrates, these, surfaces, are, useful, when, the, runway, is, located, next, to, a, body, of, water, or, other, hazard, and, prevent, the, planes, from, overrunning, the, end, of, the, field, airports, often, have, on, site, firefighters, to, respond, to, emergencies, these, use, specialized, vehicles, known, as, airport, crash, tenders, most, civil, aviation, authorities, have, required, levels, of, on, site, emergency, response, capabilities, based, on, an, airport, s, traffic, at, airports, where, civil, and, military, operations, share, a, common, set, of, runways, and, infrastructure, emergency, response, is, often, managed, by, the, relevant, military, unit, as, part, of, their, base, s, operations, aircraft, noise, is, a, major, cause, of, noise, disturbance, to, residents, living, near, airports, sleep, can, be, affected, if, the, airports, operate, night, and, early, morning, flights, aircraft, noise, occurs, not, only, from, take, offs, and, landings, but, also, from, ground, operations, including, maintenance, and, testing, of, aircraft, noise, can, have, other, health, effects, as, well, other, noises, and, environmental, concerns, are, vehicle, traffic, causing, noise, and, pollution, on, roads, leading, to, the, airport, the, construction, of, new, airports, or, addition, of, runways, to, existing, airports, is, often, resisted, by, local, residents, because, of, the, effect, on, countryside, historical, sites, and, local, flora, and, fauna, due, to, the, risk, of, collision, between, birds, and, aircraft, large, airports, undertake, population, control, programs, where, they, frighten, or, shoot, birds, the, construction, of, airports, has, been, known, to, change, local, weather, patterns, for, example, because, they, often, flatten, out, large, areas, they, can, be, susceptible, to, fog, in, areas, where, fog, rarely, forms, in, addition, they, generally, replace, trees, and, grass, with, pavement, they, often, change, drainage, patterns, in, agricultural, areas, leading, to, more, flooding, run, off, and, erosion, in, the, surrounding, land, airports, are, often, built, on, low, lying, coastal, land, globally, 269, airports, are, at, risk, of, coastal, flooding, now, a, temperature, rise, of, 2, o, c, consistent, with, the, paris, agreement, would, lead, to, 100, airports, being, below, mean, sea, level, and, 364, airports, at, risk, of, flooding, if, global, mean, temperature, rise, exceeds, this, then, as, many, as, 572, airports, will, be, at, risk, by, 2100, leading, to, major, disruptions, without, appropriate, adaptation, some, of, the, airport, administrations, prepare, and, publish, annual, environmental, reports, to, show, how, they, consider, these, environmental, concerns, in, airport, management, issues, and, how, they, protect, environment, from, airport, operations, these, reports, contain, all, environmental, protection, measures, performed, by, airport, administration, in, terms, of, water, air, soil, and, noise, pollution, resource, conservation, and, protection, of, natural, life, around, the, airport, a, 2019, report, from, the, cooperative, research, programs, of, the, us, transportation, research, board, showed, all, airports, have, a, role, to, play, in, advancing, greenhouse, gas, ghg, reduction, initiatives, small, airports, have, demonstrated, leadership, by, using, their, less, complex, organizational, structure, to, implement, newer, technologies, and, to, serve, as, a, proving, ground, for, their, feasibility, large, airports, have, the, economic, stability, and, staff, resources, necessary, to, grow, in, house, expertise, and, fund, comprehensive, new, programs, a, growing, number, of, airports, are, installing, solar, photovoltaic, arrays, to, offset, their, electricity, use, the, national, renewable, energy, lab, has, shown, this, can, be, done, safely, this, can, also, be, done, on, the, roofs, of, the, airports, and, it, has, been, found, that, the, solar, panels, on, these, buildings, work, more, effectively, when, compared, to, residential, panels, the, world, s, first, airport, to, be, fully, powered, by, solar, energy, is, located, at, kochi, india, another, airport, known, for, considering, environmental, concerns, is, seymour, airport, in, the, galapagos, islands, as, a, part, of, their, sustainability, efforts, more, and, more, airports, are, starting, to, explore, the, consequences, of, more, electric, aircraft, coming, into, service, electric, aircraft, need, a, lot, of, energy, operating, 49, small, 50, passenger, short, range, battery, electric, aircraft, would, demand, at, least, 16, gwh, year, and, with, short, turnaround, times, between, different, flights, the, charging, powers, have, to, be, substantial, to, tackle, these, issues, more, airports, are, starting, to, look, into, alternative, energy, production, such, as, solar, power, and, wind, power, but, also, how, to, use, airport, areas, for, biomass, production, another, solution, investigated, is, to, use, energy, storage, to, charge, during, the, night, and, use, to, charge, the, aircraft, during, daytime, airports, as, major, international, travel, hubs, have, the, potential, to, be, significant, transmission, points, for, infectious, diseases, a, notable, study, conducted, during, the, peak, of, the, 2015, 2016, flu, season, at, helsinki, vantaa, airport, in, finland, revealed, that, commonly, touched, surfaces, in, airports, especially, the, plastic, security, screening, trays, are, highly, susceptible, to, contamination, by, respiratory, viruses, these, trays, are, touched, by, hundreds, of, passengers, daily, and, being, made, of, plastic, a, non, porous, material, provide, an, environment, where, viruses, can, survive, for, extended, periods, in, comparison, bathroom, surfaces, in, the, same, airport, tested, negative, for, respiratory, viruses, possibly, indicating, a, heightened, awareness, of, hygiene, in, these, spaces, hand, hygiene, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, preventing, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, in, airports, research, indicates, that, only, about, 70, of, individuals, wash, their, hands, after, using, the, toilet, and, of, those, only, 50, do, so, correctly, in, airport, settings, just, one, in, five, individuals, maintain, clean, hands, defined, as, washing, with, soap, for, at, least, 15, seconds, in, the, preceding, hour, given, the, frequent, touching, of, shared, surfaces, in, airports, such, as, trays, railings, and, touch, panels, this, poses, a, significant, risk, for, disease, transmission, a, study, from, the, university, of, cyprus, and, mit, used, models, and, simulations, to, demonstrate, that, increasing, hand, cleanliness, from, 20, to, 30, in, all, airports, could, reduce, the, potential, global, impact, of, a, disease, by, 24, if, cleanliness, levels, reached, 60, this, impact, could, decrease, by, 69, focusing, on, just, the, top, 10, most, influential, airports, for, disease, spread, enhancing, hand, hygiene, practices, could, still, significantly, reduce, disease, transmission, rates, from, 45, to, 37, the, findings, underscore, the, importance, of, promoting, hand, washing, in, airports, as, a, key, measure, in, preventing, the, global, spread, of, diseases, an, airbase, sometimes, referred, to, as, an, air, station, or, airfield, provides, basing, and, support, of, military, aircraft, some, airbases, known, as, military, airports, provide, facilities, similar, to, their, civilian, counterparts, for, example, raf, brize, norton, in, the, uk, has, a, terminal, that, caters, to, passengers, for, the, royal, air, force, s, scheduled, flights, to, the, falkland, islands, some, airbases, are, co, located, with, civilian, airports, sharing, the, same, atc, facilities, runways, taxiways, and, emergency, services, but, with, separate, terminals, parking, areas, and, hangars, bardufoss, airport, bardufoss, air, station, in, norway, and, pune, airport, in, india, are, examples, of, this, an, aircraft, carrier, is, a, warship, that, functions, as, a, mobile, airbase, aircraft, carriers, allow, a, naval, force, to, project, air, power, without, having, to, depend, on, local, bases, for, land, based, aircraft, after, their, development, in, world, war, i, aircraft, carriers, replaced, the, battleship, as, the, centrepiece, of, a, modern, fleet, during, world, war, ii, most, airports, in, the, united, states, are, designated, private, use, airports, meaning, that, whether, publicly, or, privately, owned, the, airport, is, not, open, or, available, for, use, by, the, public, although, use, of, the, airport, may, be, made, available, by, invitation, of, the, owner, or, manager, airports, are, uniquely, represented, by, their, iata, airport, code, and, icao, airport, code, most, airport, names, include, the, location, many, airport, names, honour, a, public, figure, commonly, a, politician, e, g, charles, de, gaulle, airport,

explorers, e, g, venice, marco, polo, airport, some, airports, have, unofficial, names, possibly, so, widely, circulated, that, its, official, name, is, little, used, or, even, known, some, airport, names, include, the, word, international, to, indicate, their, ability, to, handle, international, air, traffic, this, includes, some, airports, that, do, not, have, scheduled, international, airline, services, e, g, port, elizabeth, international, airport, the, earliest, aircraft, takeoff, and, landing, sites, were, grassy, fields, the, plane, could, approach, at, any, angle, that, provided, a, favorable, wind, direction, a, slight, improvement, was, the, dirt, only, field, which, eliminated, the, drag, from, grass, however, these, functioned, well, only, in, dry, conditions, later, concrete, surfaces, would, allow, landings, regardless, of, meteorological, conditions, the, title, of, world, s, oldest, airport, is, disputed, toussus, le, noble, airport, near, paris, was, established, in, 1907, and, has, been, operating, since, college, park, airport, in, maryland, us, established, in, 1909, by, wilbur, wright, serves, only, general, aviation, traffic, beijing, nanyuan, airport, in, china, which, was, built, to, accommodate, planes, in, 1904, and, airships, in, 1907, opened, in, 1910, it, was, in, operation, until, september, 2019, pearson, field, airport, in, vancouver, washington, united, states, was, built, to, accommodate, planes, in, 1905, and, airships, in, 1911, and, is, still, in, use, as, of, february, 2024, hamburg, airport, opened, in, january, 1911, making, it, the, oldest, commercial, airport, in, the, world, which, is, still, in, operation, bremen, airport, opened, in, 1913, and, remains, in, use, although, it, served, as, an, american, military, field, between, 1945, and, 1949, amsterdam, airport, schiphol, opened, on, september, 16, 1916, as, a, military, airfield, but, has, accepted, civil, aircraft, only, since, december, 17, 1920, allowing, sydney, airport, which, started, operations, in, january, 1920, to, claim, to, be, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, continuously, operating, commercial, airports, minneapolis, saint, paul, international, airport, in, the, us, opened, in, 1920, and, has, been, in, continuous, commercial, service, since, it, serves, about, 35, 000, 000, passengers, each, year, and, continues, to, expand, recently, opening, a, new, 11, 000, foot, 3, 355, m, runway, of, the, airports, constructed, during, this, early, period, in, aviation, it, is, one, of, the, largest, and, busiest, that, is, still, currently, operating, don, mueang, international, airport, near, bangkok, thailand, opened, 1914, is, also, a, contender, as, well, as, the, rome, ciampino, airport, which, opened, in, 1916, increased, aircraft, traffic, during, world, war, i, led, to, the, construction, of, landing, fields, aircraft, had, to, approach, these, from, certain, directions, and, this, led, to, the, development, of, aids, for, directing, the, approach, and, landing, slope, following, the, war, some, of, these, military, airfields, added, civil, facilities, for, handling, passenger, traffic, one, of, the, earliest, such, fields, was, paris, le, bourget, airport, at, le, bourget, near, paris, the, first, airport, to, operate, scheduled, international, commercial, services, was, hounslow, heath, aerodrome, in, august, 1919, but, it, was, closed, and, supplanted, by, croydon, airport, in, march, 1920, in, 1922, the, first, permanent, airport, and, commercial, terminal, solely, for, commercial, aviation, was, opened, at, flughafen, devau, near, what, was, then, k, nigsberg, east, prussia, the, airports, of, this, era, used, a, paved, apron, which, permitted, night, flying, as, well, as, landing, heavier, aircraft, the, first, lighting, used, on, an, airport, was, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 1920s, in, the, 1930s, approach, lighting, came, into, use, these, indicated, the, proper, direction, and, angle, of, descent, the, colours, and, flash, intervals, of, these, lights, became, standardized, under, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, in, the, 1940s, the, slope, line, approach, system, was, introduced, this, consisted, of, two, rows, of, lights, that, formed, a, funnel, indicating, an, aircraft, s, position, on, the, glideslope, additional, lights, indicated, incorrect, altitude, and, direction, after, world, war, ii, airport, design, became, more, sophisticated, passenger, buildings, were, being, grouped, together, in, an, island, with, runways, arranged, in, groups, about, the, terminal, this, arrangement, permitted, expansion, of, the, facilities, but, it, also, meant, that, passengers, had, to, travel, further, to, reach, their, plane, an, improvement, in, the, landing, field, was, the, introduction, of, grooves, in, the, concrete, surface, these, run, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, the, landing, aircraft, and, serve, to, draw, off, excess, rainwater, that, could, build, up, in, front, of, the, plane, s, wheels, airport, construction, boomed, during, the, 1960s, with, the, increase, in, jet, aircraft, traffic, runways, were, extended, out, to, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, the, fields, were, constructed, out, of, reinforced, concrete, using, a, slip, form, machine, that, produces, a, continuous, slab, with, no, disruptions, along, the, length, the, early, 1960s, also, saw, the, introduction, of, jet, bridge, systems, to, modern, airport, terminals, an, innovation, which, eliminated, outdoor, passenger, boarding, these, systems, became, commonplace, in, the, united, states, by, the, 1970s, the, malicious, use, of, uavs, has, led, to, the, deployment, of, counter, unmanned, air, system, c, uas, technologies, such, as, the, aaronia, aartos, which, have, been, installed, on, major, international, airports, airports, have, played, major, roles, in, films, and, television, programs, due, to, their, very, nature, as, a, transport, and, international, hub, and, sometimes, because, of, distinctive, architectural, features, of, particular, airports, one, such, example, of, this, is, the, terminal, a, film, about, a, man, who, becomes, permanently, grounded, in, an, airport, terminal, and, must, survive, only, on, the, food, and, shelter, provided, by, the, airport, they, are, also, one, of, the, major, elements, in, movies, such, as, the, v, i, p, s, speed, airplane, airport, 1970, die, hard, 2, soul, plane, jackie, brown, get, shorty, home, alone,

played, important, parts, in, television, series, like, lost, the, amazing, race, america, s, next, top, model, season, 10, 90, day, fianc, air, crash, investigation, which, have, significant, parts, of, their, story, set, within, airports, in, other, programmes, and, films, airports, are, merely, indicative, of, journeys, e, g, good, will, hunting, several, computer, simulation, games, put, the, player, in, charge, of, an, airport, these, include, the, airport, tycoon, series, simairport, and, airport, ceo, each, civil, aviation, authority, provides, a, source, of, information, about, airports, in, their, country, this, will, contain, information, on, airport, elevation, airport, lighting, runway, information, communications, facilities, and, frequencies, hours, of, operation, nearby, navaids, and, contact, information, where, prior, arrangement, for, landing, is, necessary, a, comprehensive, consumer, business, directory, of, commercial, airports, in, the, world, primarily, for, airports, as, businesses, rather, than, for, pilots, is, organized, by, the, trade, group, airports, council, international, lists
