satellite, television, is, a, service, that, delivers, television, programming, to, viewers, by, relaying, it, from, a, communications, satellite, orbiting, the, earth, directly, to, the, viewer, s, location, the, signals, are, received, via, an, outdoor, parabolic, antenna, commonly, referred, to, as, a, satellite, dish, and, a, low, noise, block, downconverter, a, satellite, receiver, decodes, the, desired, television, program, for, viewing, on, a, television, set, receivers, can, be, external, set, top, boxes, or, a, built, in, television, tuner, satellite, television, provides, a, wide, range, of, channels, and, services, it, is, usually, the, only, television, available, in, many, remote, geographic, areas, without, terrestrial, television, or, cable, television, service, different, receivers, are, required, for, the, two, types, some, transmissions, and, channels, are, unencrypted, and, therefore, free, to, air, while, many, other, channels, are, transmitted, with, encryption, free, to, view, channels, are, encrypted, but, not, charged, for, while, pay, television, requires, the, viewer, to, subscribe, and, pay, a, monthly, fee, to, receive, the, programming, modern, systems, signals, are, relayed, from, a, communications, satellite, on, the, x, band, 8, 12, ghz, or, k, u, band, 12, 18, ghz, frequencies, requiring, only, a, small, dish, less, than, a, meter, in, diameter, the, first, satellite, tv, systems, were, a, now, obsolete, type, known, as, television, receive, only, these, systems, received, weaker, analog, signals, transmitted, in, the, c, band, 4, 8, ghz, from, fss, type, satellites, requiring, the, use, of, large, 2, 3, meter, dishes, consequently, these, systems, were, nicknamed, big, dish, systems, and, were, more, expensive, and, less, popular, early, systems, used, analog, signals, but, modern, ones, use, digital, signals, which, allow, transmission, of, the, modern, television, standard, high, definition, television, due, to, the, significantly, improved, spectral, efficiency, of, digital, broadcasting, as, of, 2022, star, one, d2, from, brazil, is, the, only, remaining, satellite, broadcasting, in, analog, signals, the, satellites, used, for, broadcasting, television, are, usually, in, a, geostationary, orbit, 36, 000, km, 22, 000, mi, above, the, earth, s, equator, the, advantage, of, this, orbit, is, that, the, satellite, s, orbital, period, equals, the, rotation, rate, of, the, earth, so, the, satellite, appears, at, a, fixed, position, in, the, sky, thus, the, satellite, dish, antenna, which, receives, the, signal, can, be, aimed, permanently, at, the, location, of, the, satellite, and, does, not, have, to, track, a, moving, satellite, a, few, systems, instead, use, a, highly, elliptical, orbit, with, inclination, of, 63, 4, degrees, and, an, orbital, period, of, about, twelve, hours, known, as, a, molniya, orbit, satellite, television, like, other, communications, relayed, by, satellite, starts, with, a, transmitting, antenna, located, at, an, uplink, facility, uplink, satellite, dishes, are, very, large, as, much, as, 9, to, 12, meters, 30, to, 40, feet, in, diameter, the, increased, diameter, results, in, more, accurate, aiming, and, increased, signal, strength, at, the, satellite, the, uplink, dish, is, pointed, toward, a, specific, satellite, and, the, uplinked, signals, are, transmitted, within, a, specific, frequency, range, so, as, to, be, received, by, one, of, the, transponders, tuned, to, that, frequency, range, aboard, that, satellite, the, transponder, re, transmits, the, signals, back, to, earth, at, a, different, frequency, a, process, known, as, translation, used, to, avoid, interference, with, the, uplink, signal, typically, in, the, 10, 7, 12, 7, ghz, band, but, some, still, transmit, in, the, c, band, 4, 8, ghz, k, u, band, 12, 18, ghz, or, both, the, leg, of, the, signal, path, from, the, satellite, to, the, receiving, earth, station, is, called, the, downlink, a, typical, satellite, has, up, to, 32, k, u, band, or, 24, c, band, transponders, or, more, for, k, u, c, hybrid, satellites, typical, transponders, each, have, a, bandwidth, between, 27, and, 50, mhz, each, geostationary, c, band, satellite, needs, to, be, spaced, 2, longitude, from, the, next, satellite, to, avoid, interference, for, k, u, the, spacing, can, be, 1, this, means, that, there, is, an, upper, limit, of, 360, 2, 180, geostationary, c, band, satellites, or, 360, 1, 360, geostationary, k, u, band, satellites, c, band, transmission, is, susceptible, to, terrestrial, interference, while, k, u, band, transmission, is, affected, by, rain, as, water, is, an, excellent, absorber, of, microwaves, at, this, particular, frequency, the, latter, is, even, more, adversely, affected, by, ice, crystals, in, thunder, clouds, on, occasion, sun, outage, will, occur, when, the, sun, lines, up, directly, behind, the, geostationary, satellite, to, which, the, receiving, antenna, is, pointed, the, downlink, satellite, signal, quite, weak, after, traveling, the, great, distance, see, path, loss, is, collected, with, a, parabolic, receiving, dish, which, reflects, the, weak, signal, to, the, dish, s, focal, point, mounted, on, brackets, at, the, dish, s, focal, point, is, a, device, called, a, feedhorn, or, collector, the, feedhorn, is, a, section, of, waveguide, with, a, flared, front, end, that, gathers, the, signals, at, or, near, the, focal, point, and, conducts, them, to, a, probe, or, pickup, connected, to, a, low, noise, block, downconverter, lnb, the, lnb, amplifies, the, signals, and, downconverts, them, to, a, lower, block, of, intermediate, frequencies, if, usually, in, the, l, band, the, original, c, band, satellite, television, systems, used, a, low, noise, amplifier, lna, connected, to, the, feedhorn, at, the, focal, point, of, the, dish, the, amplified, signal, still, at, the, higher, microwave, frequencies, had, to, be, fed, via, very, expensive, low, loss, 50, ohm, impedance, gas, filled, hardline, coaxial, cable, with, relatively, complex, n, connectors, to, an, indoor, receiver, or, in, other, designs, a, downconverter, a, mixer, and, a, voltage, tuned, oscillator, with, some, filter, circuitry, for, downconversion, to, an, intermediate, frequency, the, channel, selection, was, controlled, typically, by, a, voltage, tuned, oscillator, with, the, tuning, voltage, being, fed, via, a, separate, cable, to, the, headend, but, this, design, evolved, designs, for, microstrip, based, converters, for, amateur, radio, frequencies, were, adapted, for, the, 4, ghz, c, band, central, to, these, designs, was, concept, of, block, downconversion, of, a, range, of, frequencies, to, a, lower, more, easily, handled, if, the, advantages, of, using, an, lnb, are, that, cheaper, cable, can, be, used, to, connect, the, indoor, receiver, to, the, satellite, television, dish, and, lnb, and, that, the, technology, for, handling, the, signal, at, l, band, and, uhf, was, far, cheaper, than, that, for, handling, the, signal, at, c, band, frequencies, the, shift, to, cheaper, technology, from, the, hardline, and, n, connectors, of, the, early, c, band, systems, to, the, cheaper, and, simpler, 75, ohm, cable, and, f, connectors, allowed, the, early, satellite, television, receivers, to, use, what, were, in, reality, modified, uhf, television, tuners, which, selected, the, satellite, television, channel, for, down, conversion, to, a, lower, intermediate, frequency, centered, on, 70, mhz, where, it, was, demodulated, this, shift, allowed, the, satellite, television, dth, industry, to, change, from, being, a, largely, hobbyist, one, where, only, small, numbers, of, systems, costing, thousands, of, us, dollars, were, built, to, a, far, more, commercial, one, of, mass, production, in, the, united, states, service, providers, use, the, intermediate, frequency, ranges, of, 950, 2150, mhz, to, carry, the, signal, from, the, lnbf, at, the, dish, down, to, the, receiver, this, allows, for, the, transmission, of, uhf, signals, along, the, same, span, of, coaxial, wire, at, the, same, time, in, some, applications, directv, au9, s, and, at, 9, ranges, of, the, lower, b, band, and, 2250, 3000, mhz, are, used, newer, lnbfs, in, use, by, directv, called, swm, single, wire, multiswitch, are, used, to, implement, single, cable, distribution, and, use, a, wider, frequency, range, of, 2, 2150, mhz, the, satellite, receiver, or, set, top, box, demodulates, and, converts, the, signals, to, the, desired, form, outputs, for, television, audio, data, etc, often, the, receiver, includes, the, capability, to, selectively, unscramble, or, decrypt, the, received, signal, to, provide, premium, services, to, some, subscribers, the, receiver, is, then, called, an, integrated, receiver, decoder, or, ird, low, loss, cable, e, g, rg, 6, rg, 11, etc, is, used, to, connect, the, receiver, to, the, lnbf, or, lnb, rg, 59, is, not, recommended, for, this, application, as, it, is, not, technically, designed, to, carry, frequencies, above, 950, mhz, but, may, work, in, some, circumstances, depending, on, the, quality, of, the, coaxial, wire, signal, levels, cable, length, etc, a, practical, problem, relating, to, home, satellite, reception, is, that, an, lnb, can, basically, only, handle, a, single, receiver, this, is, because, the, lnb, is, translating, two, different, circular, polarizations, right, hand, and, left, hand, and, in, the, case, of, k, band, two, different, frequency, bands, lower, and, upper, to, the, same, frequency, range, on, the, cable, depending, on, which, frequency, and, polarization, a, transponder, is, using, the, satellite, receiver, has, to, switch, the, lnb, into, one, of, four, different, modes, in, order, to, receive, a, specific, channel, this, is, handled, by, the, receiver, using, the, diseqc, protocol, to, control, the, lnb, mode, if, several, satellite, receivers, are, to, be, attached, to, a, single, dish, a, so, called, multiswitch, will, have, to, be, used, in, conjunction, with, a, special, type, of, lnb, there, are, also, lnbs, available, with, a, multi, switch, already, integrated, this, problem, becomes, more, complicated, when, several, receivers, are, to, use, several, dishes, or, several, lnbs, mounted, in, a, single, dish, pointing, to, different, satellites, a, common, solution, for, consumers, wanting, to, access, multiple, satellites, is, to, deploy, a, single, dish, with, a, single, lnb, and, to, rotate, the, dish, using, an, electric, motor, the, axis, of, rotation, has, to, be, set, up, in, the, north, south, direction, and, depending, on, the, geographical, location, of, the, dish, have, a, specific, vertical, tilt, set, up, properly, the, motorized, dish, when, turned, will, sweep, across, all, possible, positions, for, satellites, lined, up, along, the, geostationary, orbit, directly, above, the, equator, the, dish, will, then, be, capable, of, receiving, any, geostationary, satellite, that, is, visible, at, the, specific, location, i, e, that, is, above, the, horizon, the, diseqc, protocol, has, been, extended, to, encompass, commands, for, steering, dish, rotors, there, are, five, major, components, in, a, satellite, system, the, programming, source, the, broadcast, center, the, satellite, the, satellite, dish, and, the, receiver, direct, broadcast, satellites, used, for, transmission, of, satellite, television, signals, are, generally, in, geostationary, orbit, 37, 000, km, 23, 000, mi, above, the, earth, s, equator, the, reason, for, using, this, orbit, is, that, the, satellite, circles, the, earth, at, the, same, rate, as, the, earth, rotates, so, the, satellite, appears, at, a, fixed, point, in, the, sky, thus, satellite, dishes, can, be, aimed, permanently, at, that, point, and, do, not, need, a, tracking, system, to, turn, to, follow, a, moving, satellite, a, few, satellite, tv, systems, use, satellites, in, a, molniya, orbit, a, highly, elliptical, orbit, with, inclination, of, 63, 4, degrees, and, an, orbital, period, of, about, twelve, hours, satellite, television, like, other, communications, relayed, by, satellite, starts, with, a, transmitting, antenna, located, at, an, uplink, facility, uplink, facilities, transmit, the, signal, to, the, satellite, over, a, narrow, beam, of, microwaves, typically, in, the, c, band, frequency, range, due, to, its, resistance, to, rain, fade, uplink, satellite, dishes, are, very, large, often, as, much, as, 9, to, 12, metres, 30, to, 40, feet, in, diameter, to, achieve, accurate, aiming, and, increased, signal, strength, at, the, satellite, to, improve, reliability, the, uplink, dish, is, pointed, toward, a, specific, satellite, and, the, uplinked, signals, are, transmitted, within, a, specific, frequency, range, so, as, to, be, received, by, one, of, the, transponders, tuned, to, that, frequency, range, aboard, that, satellite, the, transponder, then, converts, the, signals, to, k, u, band, a, process, known, as, translation, and, transmits, them, back, to, earth, to, be, received, by, home, satellite, stations, the, downlinked, satellite, signal, weaker, after, traveling, the, great, distance, see, path, loss, is, collected, by, using, a, rooftop, parabolic, receiving, dish, satellite, dish, which, reflects, the, weak, signal, to, the, dish, s, focal, point, mounted, on, brackets, at, the, dish, s, focal, point, is, a, feedhorn, which, passes, the, signals, through, a, waveguide, to, a, device, called, a, low, noise, block, converter, lnb, or, low, noise, converter, lnc, attached, to, the, horn, the, lnb, amplifies, the, weak, signals, filters, the, block, of, frequencies, in, which, the, satellite, television, signals, are, transmitted, and, converts, the, block, of, frequencies, to, a, lower, frequency, range, in, the, l, band, range, the, signal, is, then, passed, through, a, coaxial, cable, into, the, residence, to, the, satellite, television, receiver, a, set, top, box, next, to, the, television, the, reason, for, using, the, lnb, to, do, the, frequency, translation, at, the, dish, is, so, that, the, signal, can, be, carried, into, the, residence, using, cheap, coaxial, cable, to, transport, the, signal, into, the, house, at, its, original, k, u, band, microwave, frequency, would, require, an, expensive, waveguide, a, metal, pipe, to, carry, the, radio, waves, the, cable, connecting, the, receiver, to, the, lnb, are, of, the, low, loss, type, rg, 6, quad, shield, rg, 6, or, rg, 11, rg, 59, is, not, recommended, for, this, application, as, it, is, not, technically, designed, to, carry, frequencies, above, 950, mhz, but, will, work, in, many, circumstances, depending, on, the, quality, of, the, coaxial, wire, the, shift, to, more, affordable, technology, from, the, 50, ohm, impedance, cable, and, n, connectors, of, the, early, c, band, systems, to, the, cheaper, 75, ohm, technology, and, f, connectors, allowed, the, early, satellite, television, receivers, to, use, what, were, in, reality, modified, uhf, television, tuners, which, selected, the, satellite, television, channel, for, down, conversion, to, another, lower, intermediate, frequency, centered, on, 70, mhz, where, it, was, demodulated, an, lnb, can, only, handle, a, single, receiver, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, lnb, is, mapping, two, different, circular, polarisations, right, hand, and, left, hand, and, in, the, case, of, the, k, u, band, two, different, reception, bands, lower, and, upper, to, one, and, the, same, frequency, band, on, the, cable, and, is, a, practical, problem, for, home, satellite, reception, depending, on, which, frequency, a, transponder, is, transmitting, at, and, on, what, polarisation, it, is, using, the, satellite, receiver, has, to, switch, the, lnb, into, one, of, four, different, modes, in, order, to, receive, a, specific, desired, program, on, a, specific, transponder, the, receiver, uses, the, diseqc, protocol, to, control, the, lnb, mode, which, handles, this, if, several, satellite, receivers, are, to, be, attached, to, a, single, dish, a, so, called, multiswitch, must, be, used, in, conjunction, with, a, special, type, of, lnb,

from, the, satellite, converts, the, signal, to, a, lower, intermediate, frequency, decrypts, the, encrypted, signal, demodulates, the, radio, signal, and, sends, the, resulting, video, signal, to, the, television, through, a, cable, to, decrypt, the, signal, the, receiver, box, must, be, activated, by, the, satellite, company, if, the, customer, fails, to, pay, their, monthly, bill, the, box, is, deactivated, by, a, signal, from, the, company, and, the, system, will, not, work, until, the, company, reactivates, it, some, receivers, are, capable, of, decrypting, the, received, signal, itself, these, receivers, are, called, integrated, receiver, decoders, or, irds, analog, television, which, was, distributed, via, satellite, was, usually, sent, scrambled, or, unscrambled, in, ntsc, pal, or, secam, television, broadcast, standards, the, analog, signal, is, frequency, modulated, and, is, converted, from, an, fm, signal, to, what, is, referred, to, as, baseband, this, baseband, comprises, the, video, signal, and, the, audio, subcarrier, s, the, audio, subcarrier, is, further, demodulated, to, provide, a, raw, audio, signal, later, signals, were, digitized, television, signals, or, multiplex, of, signals, typically, qpsk, in, general, digital, television, including, that, transmitted, via, satellites, is, based, on, open, standards, such, as, mpeg, and, dvb, s, dvb, s2, or, isdb, s, the, conditional, access, encryption, scrambling, methods, include, nds, biss, conax, digicipher, irdeto, cryptoworks, dg, crypt, beta, digital, seca, mediaguard, logiways, nagravision, powervu, viaccess, videocipher, and, videoguard, many, conditional, access, systems, have, been, compromised, an, event, called, sun, outage, occurs, when, the, sun, lines, up, directly, behind, the, satellite, in, the, field, of, view, of, the, receiving, satellite, dish, this, happens, for, about, a, 10, minute, period, daily, around, midday, twice, every, year, for, a, two, week, period, in, the, spring, and, fall, around, the, equinox, during, this, period, the, sun, is, within, the, main, lobe, of, the, dish, s, reception, pattern, so, the, strong, microwave, noise, emitted, by, the, sun, on, the, same, frequencies, used, by, the, satellite, s, transponders, drowns, out, reception, direct, to, home, dth, can, either, refer, to, the, communications, satellites, themselves, that, deliver, service, or, the, actual, television, service, most, satellite, television, customers, in, developed, television, markets, get, their, programming, through, a, direct, broadcast, satellite, dbs, provider, signals, are, transmitted, using, k, u, band, 12, to, 18, ghz, and, are, completely, digital, which, means, it, has, high, picture, and, stereo, sound, quality, programming, for, satellite, television, channels, comes, from, multiple, sources, and, may, include, live, studio, feeds, the, broadcast, center, assembles, and, packages, programming, into, channels, for, transmission, and, where, necessary, encrypts, the, channels, the, signal, is, then, sent, to, the, uplink, where, it, is, transmitted, to, the, satellite, with, some, broadcast, centers, the, studios, administration, and, up, link, are, all, part, of, the, same, campus, the, satellite, then, translates, and, broadcasts, the, channels, most, systems, use, the, dvb, s, standard, for, transmission, with, pay, television, services, the, data, stream, is, encrypted, and, requires, proprietary, reception, equipment, while, the, underlying, reception, technology, is, similar, the, pay, television, technology, is, proprietary, often, consisting, of, a, conditional, access, module, and, smart, card, this, measure, assures, satellite, television, providers, that, only, authorized, paying, subscribers, have, access, to, pay, television, content, but, at, the, same, time, can, allow, free, to, air, channels, to, be, viewed, even, by, the, people, with, standard, equipment, available, in, the, market, some, countries, operate, satellite, television, services, which, can, be, received, for, free, without, paying, a, subscription, fee, this, is, called, free, to, air, satellite, television, germany, is, likely, the, leader, in, free, to, air, with, approximately, 250, digital, channels, including, 83, hdtv, channels, and, various, regional, channels, broadcast, from, the, astra, 19, 2, e, satellite, constellation, these, are, not, marketed, as, a, dbs, service, but, are, received, in, approximately, 18, million, homes, as, well, as, in, any, home, using, the, sky, deutschland, commercial, dbs, system, all, german, analogue, satellite, broadcasts, ceased, on, 30, april, 2012, the, united, kingdom, has, approximately, 160, digital, channels, including, the, regional, variations, of, bbc, channels, itv, channels, channel, 4, and, channel, 5, that, are, broadcast, without, encryption, from, the, astra, 28, 2, e, satellite, constellation, and, receivable, on, any, dvb, s, receiver, a, dvb, s2, receiver, is, required, for, certain, high, definition, television, services, most, of, these, channels, are, included, within, the, sky, epg, and, an, increasing, number, within, the, freesat, epg, india, s, national, broadcaster, doordarshan, promotes, a, free, to, air, dbs, package, as, dd, free, dish, which, is, provided, as, in, fill, for, the, country, s, terrestrial, transmission, network, it, is, broadcast, from, gsat, 15, at, 93, 5, e, and, contains, about, 80, fta, channels, while, originally, launched, as, backhaul, for, their, digital, terrestrial, television, service, a, large, number, of, french, channels, are, free, to, air, on, satellites, at, 5, w, and, have, recently, been, announced, as, being, official, in, fill, for, the, dtt, network, in, north, america, united, states, canada, and, mexico, there, are, over, 80, fta, digital, channels, available, on, galaxy, 19, with, the, majority, being, ethnic, or, religious, in, nature, other, fta, satellites, include, amc, 4, amc, 6, galaxy, 18, and, satmex, 5, a, company, called, glorystar, promotes, fta, religious, broadcasters, on, galaxy, 19, satellite, tv, has, seen, a, decline, in, consumers, since, the, 2010s, due, to, the, cord, cutting, trend, where, people, are, shifting, towards, internet, based, streaming, television, and, free, over, the, air, television, the, term, television, receive, only, or, tvro, arose, during, the, early, days, of, satellite, television, reception, to, differentiate, it, from, commercial, satellite, television, uplink, and, downlink, operations, transmit, and, receive, this, was, the, primary, method, of, satellite, television, transmissions, before, the, satellite, television, industry, shifted, with, the, launch, of, higher, powered, dbs, satellites, in, the, early, 1990s, which, transmitted, their, signals, on, the, k, u, band, frequencies, satellite, television, channels, at, that, time, were, intended, to, be, used, by, cable, television, networks, rather, than, received, by, home, viewers, early, satellite, television, receiver, systems, were, largely, constructed, by, hobbyists, and, engineers, these, early, tvro, systems, operated, mainly, on, the, c, band, frequencies, and, the, dishes, required, were, large, typically, over, 3, meters, 10, ft, in, diameter, consequently, tvro, is, often, referred, to, as, big, dish, or, big, ugly, dish, bud, satellite, television, tvro, systems, were, designed, to, receive, analog, and, digital, satellite, feeds, of, both, television, or, audio, from, both, c, band, and, k, u, band, transponders, on, fss, type, satellites, the, higher, frequency, k, u, band, systems, tend, to, resemble, dbs, systems, and, can, use, a, smaller, dish, antenna, because, of, the, higher, power, transmissions, and, greater, antenna, gain, tvro, systems, tend, to, use, larger, rather, than, smaller, satellite, dish, antennas, since, it, is, more, likely, that, the, owner, of, a, tvro, system, would, have, a, c, band, only, setup, rather, than, a, k, u, band, only, setup, additional, receiver, boxes, allow, for, different, types, of, digital, satellite, signal, reception, such, as, dvb, mpeg, 2, and, 4dtv, the, narrow, beam, width, of, a, normal, parabolic, satellite, antenna, means, it, can, only, receive, signals, from, a, single, satellite, at, a, time, simulsat, or, the, vertex, rsi, torus, is, a, quasi, parabolic, satellite, earthstation, antenna, that, is, capable, of, receiving, satellite, transmissions, from, 35, or, more, c, and, k, u, band, satellites, simultaneously, in, 1945, british, science, fiction, writer, arthur, c, clarke, proposed, a, worldwide, communications, system, which, would, function, by, means, of, three, satellites, equally, spaced, apart, in, earth, orbit, this, was, published, in, the, october, 1945, issue, of, the, wireless, world, magazine, and, won, him, the, franklin, institute, s, stuart, ballantine, medal, in, 1963, the, first, public, satellite, television, signals, from, europe, to, north, america, were, relayed, via, the, telstar, satellite, over, the, atlantic, ocean, on, 23, july, 1962, although, a, test, broadcast, had, taken, place, almost, two, weeks, earlier, on, 11, july, the, signals, were, received, and, broadcast, in, north, american, and, european, countries, and, watched, by, over, 100, million, launched, in, 1962, the, relay, 1, satellite, was, the, first, satellite, to, transmit, television, signals, from, the, us, to, japan, the, first, geosynchronous, communication, satellite, syncom, 2, was, launched, on, 26, july, 1963, the, world, s, first, commercial, communications, satellite, called, intelsat, i, and, nicknamed, early, bird, was, launched, into, geosynchronous, orbit, on, april, 6, 1965, the, first, national, network, of, television, satellites, called, orbita, was, created, by, the, soviet, union, in, october, 1967, and, was, based, on, the, principle, of, using, the, highly, elliptical, molniya, satellite, for, rebroadcasting, and, delivering, of, television, signals, to, ground, downlink, stations, the, first, commercial, north, american, satellite, to, carry, television, transmissions, was, canada, s, geostationary, anik, 1, which, was, launched, on, 9, november, 1972, ats, 6, the, world, s, first, experimental, educational, and, direct, broadcast, satellite, dbs, was, launched, on, 30, may, 1974, it, transmitted, at, 860, mhz, using, wideband, fm, modulation, and, had, two, sound, channels, the, transmissions, were, focused, on, the, indian, subcontinent, but, experimenters, were, able, to, receive, the, signal, in, western, europe, using, home, constructed, equipment, that, drew, on, uhf, television, design, techniques, already, in, use, the, first, in, a, series, of, soviet, geostationary, satellites, to, carry, direct, to, home, television, ekran, 1, was, launched, on, 26, october, 1976, it, used, a, 714, mhz, uhf, downlink, frequency, so, that, the, transmissions, could, be, received, with, existing, uhf, television, technology, rather, than, microwave, technology, the, satellite, television, industry, developed, first, in, the, us, from, the, cable, television, industry, as, communication, satellites, were, being, used, to, distribute, television, programming, to, remote, cable, television, headends, home, box, office, hbo, turner, broadcasting, system, tbs, and, christian, broadcasting, network, cbn, later, the, family, channel, were, among, the, first, to, use, satellite, television, to, deliver, programming, taylor, howard, of, san, andreas, california, became, the, first, person, to, receive, c, band, satellite, signals, with, his, home, built, system, in, 1976, in, the, us, pbs, a, non, profit, public, broadcasting, service, began, to, distribute, its, television, programming, by, satellite, in, 1978, in, 1979, soviet, engineers, developed, the, moskva, or, moscow, system, of, broadcasting, and, delivering, of, tv, signals, via, satellites, they, launched, the, gorizont, communication, satellites, later, that, same, year, these, satellites, used, geostationary, orbits, they, were, equipped, with, powerful, on, board, transponders, so, the, size, of, receiving, parabolic, antennas, of, downlink, stations, was, reduced, to, 4, and, 2, 5, metres, on, october, 18, 1979, the, federal, communications, commission, fcc, began, allowing, people, to, have, home, satellite, earth, stations, without, a, federal, government, license, the, front, cover, of, the, 1979, neiman, marcus, christmas, catalogue, featured, the, first, home, satellite, tv, stations, on, sale, for, 36, 500, the, dishes, were, nearly, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, in, diameter, and, were, remote, controlled, the, price, went, down, by, half, soon, after, that, but, there, were, only, eight, more, channels, the, society, for, private, and, commercial, earth, stations, space, an, organisation, which, represented, consumers, and, satellite, tv, system, owners, was, established, in, 1980, early, satellite, television, systems, were, not, very, popular, due, to, their, expense, and, large, dish, size, the, satellite, television, dishes, of, the, systems, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, were, 10, to, 16, feet, 3, 0, to, 4, 9, m, in, diameter, made, of, fibreglass, or, solid, aluminum, or, steel, and, in, the, united, states, cost, more, than, 5, 000, sometimes, as, much, as, 10, 000, programming, sent, from, ground, stations, was, relayed, from, eighteen, satellites, in, geostationary, orbit, located, 22, 300, miles, 35, 900, km, above, the, earth, by, 1980, satellite, television, was, well, established, in, the, us, and, europe, on, 26, april, 1982, the, first, satellite, channel, in, the, uk, satellite, television, ltd, later, sky, one, was, launched, its, signals, were, transmitted, from, the, esa, s, orbital, test, satellites, between, 1981, and, 1985, tvro, systems, sales, rates, increased, as, prices, fell, advances, in, receiver, technology, and, the, use, of, gallium, arsenide, fet, technology, enabled, the, use, of, smaller, dishes, five, hundred, thousand, systems, some, costing, as, little, as, 2000, were, sold, in, the, us, in, 1984, dishes, pointing, to, one, satellite, were, even, cheaper, people, in, areas, without, local, broadcast, stations, or, cable, television, service, could, obtain, good, quality, reception, with, no, monthly, fees, the, large, dishes, were, a, subject, of, much, consternation, as, many, people, considered, them, eyesores, and, in, the, us, most, condominiums, neighborhoods, and, other, homeowner, associations, tightly, restricted, their, use, except, in, areas, where, such, restrictions, were, illegal, these, restrictions, were, altered, in, 1986, when, the, federal, communications, commission, ruled, all, of, them, illegal, a, municipality, could, require, a, property, owner, to, relocate, the, dish, if, it, violated, other, zoning, restrictions, such, as, a, setback, requirement, but, could, not, outlaw, their, use, the, necessity, of, these, restrictions, would, slowly, decline, as, the, dishes, got, smaller, originally, all, channels, were, broadcast, in, the, clear, itc, because, the, equipment, necessary, to, receive, the, programming, was, too, expensive, for, consumers, with, the, growing, number, of, tvro, systems, the, program, providers, and, broadcasters, had, to, scramble, their, signal, and, develop, subscription, systems, in, october, 1984, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, cable, communications, policy, act, of, 1984, which, gave, those, using, tvro, systems, the, right, to, receive, signals, for, free, unless, they, were, scrambled, and, required, those, who, did, scramble, to, make, their, signals, available, for, a, reasonable, fee, since, cable, channels, could, prevent, reception, by, big, dishes, other, companies, had, an, incentive, to, offer, competition, in, january, 1986, hbo, began, using, the, now, obsolete, videocipher, ii, system, to, encrypt, their, channels, other, channels, used, less, secure, television, encryption, systems, the, scrambling, of, hbo, was, met, with, much, protest, from, owners, of, big, dish, systems, most, of, which, had, no, other, option, at, the, time, for, receiving, such, channels, claiming, that, clear, signals, from, cable, channels, would, be, difficult, to, receive, eventually, hbo, allowed, dish, owners, to, subscribe, directly, to, their, service, for, 12, 95, per, month, a, price, equal, to, or, higher, than, what, cable, subscribers, were, paying, and, required, a, descrambler, to, be, purchased, for, 395, this, led, to, the, attack, on, hbo, s, transponder, galaxy, 1, by, john, r, macdougall, in, april, 1986, one, by, one, all, commercial, channels, followed, hbo, s, lead, and, began, scrambling, their, channels, the, satellite, broadcasting, and, communications, association, sbca, was, founded, on, december, 2, 1986, as, the, result, of, a, merger, between, space, and, the, direct, broadcast, satellite, association, dbsa, videocipher, ii, used, analog, scrambling, on, its, video, signal, and, data, encryption, standard, based, encryption, on, its, audio, signal, videocipher, ii, was, defeated, and, there, was, a, black, market, for, descrambler, devices, which, were, initially, sold, as, test, devices, by, 1987, nine, channels, were, scrambled, but, 99, others, were, available, free, to, air, while, hbo, initially, charged, a, monthly, fee, of, 19, 95, soon, it, became, possible, to, unscramble, all, channels, for, 200, a, year, dish, sales, went, down, from, 600, 000, in, 1985, to, 350, 000, in, 1986, but, pay, television, services, were, seeing, dishes, as, something, positive, since, some, people, would, never, have, cable, service, and, the, industry, was, starting, to, recover, as, a, result, scrambling, also, led, to, the, development, of, pay, per, view, events, on, november, 1, 1988, nbc, began, scrambling, its, c, band, signal, but, left, its, k, u, band, signal, unencrypted, in, order, for, affiliates, to, not, lose, viewers, who, could, not, see, their, advertising, most, of, the, two, million, satellite, dish, users, in, the, united, states, still, used, c, band, abc, and, cbs, were, considering, scrambling, though, cbs, was, reluctant, due, to, the, number, of, people, unable, to, receive, local, network, affiliates, the, piracy, on, satellite, television, networks, in, the, us, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, cable, television, consumer, protection, and, competition, act, of, 1992, this, legislation, enabled, anyone, caught, engaging, in, signal, theft, to, be, fined, up, to, 50, 000, and, to, be, sentenced, to, a, maximum, of, two, years, in, prison, a, repeat, offender, can, be, fined, up, to, 100, 000, and, be, imprisoned, for, up, to, five, years, satellite, television, had, also, developed, in, europe, but, it, initially, used, low, power, communication, satellites, and, it, required, dish, sizes, of, over, 1, 7, metres, on, 11, december, 1988, however, luxembourg, launched, astra, 1a, the, first, satellite, to, provide, medium, power, satellite, coverage, to, western, europe, this, was, one, of, the, first, medium, powered, satellites, transmitting, signals, in, k, u, band, and, allowing, reception, with, small, dishes, 90, cm, the, launch, of, astra, beat, the, winner, of, the, uk, s, state, direct, broadcast, satellite, licence, holder, british, satellite, broadcasting, to, the, market, commercial, satellite, broadcasts, have, existed, in, japan, since, 1992, led, by, nhk, which, is, influential, in, the, development, of, regulations, and, has, access, to, government, funding, for, research, their, entry, into, the, market, was, protected, by, the, ministry, of, posts, and, telecommunications, mpt, resulting, in, the, wowow, channel, that, is, encrypted, and, can, be, accessed, from, nhk, dishes, with, a, decoder, in, the, us, in, the, early, 1990s, four, large, cable, companies, launched, primestar, a, direct, broadcasting, company, using, medium, power, satellites, the, relatively, strong, transmissions, allowed, the, use, of, smaller, 90, cm, dishes, its, popularity, declined, with, the, 1994, launch, of, the, hughes, directv, and, dish, network, satellite, television, systems, digital, satellite, broadcasts, began, in, 1994, in, the, united, states, through, directv, using, the, dss, format, they, were, launched, with, the, dvb, s, standard, in, south, africa, middle, east, north, africa, and, asia, pacific, in, 1994, and, 1995, and, in, 1996, and, 1997, in, european, countries, including, france, germany, spain, portugal, italy, and, the, netherlands, as, well, as, japan, north, america, and, latin, america, digital, dvb, s, broadcasts, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, started, in, 1998, japan, started, broadcasting, with, the, isdb, s, standard, in, 2000, on, march, 4, 1996, echostar, introduced, digital, sky, highway, dish, network, using, the, echostar, 1, satellite, echostar, launched, a, second, satellite, in, september, 1996, to, increase, the, number, of, channels, available, on, dish, network, to, 170, these, systems, provided, better, pictures, and, stereo, sound, on, 150, 200, video, and, audio, channels, and, allowed, small, dishes, to, be, used, this, greatly, reduced, the, popularity, of, tvro, systems, in, the, mid, 1990s, channels, began, moving, their, broadcasts, to, digital, television, transmission, using, the, digicipher, conditional, access, system, in, addition, to, encryption, the, widespread, availability, in, the, us, of, dbs, services, such, as, primestar, and, directv, had, been, reducing, the, popularity, of, tvro, systems, since, the, early, 1990s, signals, from, dbs, satellites, operating, in, the, more, recent, k, u, band, are, higher, in, both, frequency, and, power, due, to, improvements, in, the, solar, panels, and, energy, efficiency, of, modern, satellites, and, therefore, require, much, smaller, dishes, than, c, band, and, the, digital, modulation, methods, now, used, require, less, signal, strength, at, the, receiver, than, analog, modulation, methods, each, satellite, also, can, carry, up, to, 32, transponders, in, the, k, u, band, but, only, 24, in, the, c, band, and, several, digital, subchannels, can, be, multiplexed, mcpc, or, carried, separately, scpc, on, a, single, transponder, advances, in, noise, reduction, due, to, improved, microwave, technology, and, semiconductor, materials, have, also, had, an, effect, however, one, consequence, of, the, higher, frequencies, used, for, dbs, services, is, rain, fade, where, viewers, lose, signal, during, a, heavy, downpour, c, band, satellite, television, signals, are, less, prone, to, rain, fade, in, a, return, to, the, older, but, proven, technologies, of, satellite, communication, the, current, dbs, based, satellite, providers, in, the, us, dish, network, and, directv, are, now, utilizing, additional, capacity, on, the, k, u, band, transponders, of, existing, fss, class, satellites, in, addition, to, the, capacity, on, their, own, existing, fleets, of, dbs, satellites, in, orbit, this, was, done, in, order, to, provide, more, channel, capacity, for, their, systems, as, required, by, the, increasing, number, of, high, definition, and, simulcast, local, station, channels, the, reception, of, the, channels, carried, on, the, k, u, band, fss, satellite, s, respective, transponders, has, been, achieved, by, both, directv, dish, network, issuing, to, their, subscribers, dishes, twice, as, big, in, diameter, 36, than, the, previous, 18, 20, for, the, dish, network, dish500, dishes, the, services, used, initially, equipped, with, 2, circular, polarized, lnbfs, for, reception, of, 2, native, dbs, satellites, of, the, provider, 1, per, lnbf, and, 1, standard, linear, polarized, lnb, for, reception, of, channels, from, an, fss, type, satellite, these, newer, dbs, fss, hybrid, dishes, marketed, by, directv, and, dish, network, as, the, slimline, and, superdish, models, respectively, are, now, the, current, standard, for, both, providers, with, their, original, 18, 20, single, or, dual, lnbf, dishes, either, now, obsolete, or, only, used, for, program, packages, separate, channels, or, services, only, broadcast, over, the, providers, dbs, satellites, on, 29, november, 1999, us, president, bill, clinton, signed, the, satellite, home, viewer, improvement, act, shvia, the, act, allowed, americans, to, receive, local, broadcast, signals, via, direct, broadcast, satellite, systems, for, the, first, time, the, 1963, radio, regulations, of, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, defined, a, broadcasting, satellite, service, as, a, space, service, in, which, signals, transmitted, or, retransmitted, by, space, stations, or, transmitted, by, reflection, from, objects, in, orbit, around, the, earth, are, intended, for, direct, reception, by, the, general, public, in, the, 1970s, some, states, grew, concerned, that, external, broadcasting, could, alter, the, cultural, or, political, identity, of, a, state, leading, to, the, new, world, information, and, communication, order, nwico, proposal, however, satellite, broadcasts, can, not, be, restricted, on, a, per, state, basis, due, to, the, limitations, of, the, technology, around, the, time, the, macbride, report, was, released, satellite, broadcasting, was, being, discussed, at, the, un, committee, on, the, peaceful, uses, of, outer, space, copuos, where, most, of, the, members, supported, prior, consent, restrictions, for, broadcasting, in, their, territories, but, some, argued, this, would, violate, freedom, of, information, the, parties, were, unable, to, reach, a, consensus, on, this, and, in, 1982, submitted, unga, res, 37, 92, dbs, principles, to, the, un, general, assembly, which, was, adopted, by, a, majority, vote, however, most, states, capable, of, dbs, voted, against, it, the, dbs, principles, resolution, is, generally, regarded, as, ineffective, 1, more, than, 400, 000, television, service, subscribers
