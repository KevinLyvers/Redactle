a, gyroscope, from, ancient, greek, g, ros, round, and, skop, to, look, is, a, device, used, for, measuring, or, maintaining, orientation, and, angular, velocity, it, is, a, spinning, wheel, or, disc, in, which, the, axis, of, rotation, spin, axis, is, free, to, assume, any, orientation, by, itself, when, rotating, the, orientation, of, this, axis, is, unaffected, by, tilting, or, rotation, of, the, mounting, according, to, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, gyroscopes, based, on, other, operating, principles, also, exist, such, as, the, microchip, packaged, mems, gyroscopes, found, in, electronic, devices, sometimes, called, gyrometers, solid, state, ring, lasers, fibre, optic, gyroscopes, and, the, extremely, sensitive, quantum, gyroscope, applications, of, gyroscopes, include, inertial, navigation, systems, such, as, in, the, hubble, space, telescope, or, inside, the, steel, hull, of, a, submerged, submarine, due, to, their, precision, gyroscopes, are, also, used, in, gyrotheodolites, to, maintain, direction, in, tunnel, mining, gyroscopes, can, be, used, to, construct, gyrocompasses, which, complement, or, replace, magnetic, compasses, in, ships, aircraft, and, spacecraft, vehicles, in, general, to, assist, in, stability, bicycles, motorcycles, and, ships, or, be, used, as, part, of, an, inertial, guidance, system, mems, gyroscopes, are, popular, in, some, consumer, electronics, such, as, smartphones, a, gyroscope, is, an, instrument, consisting, of, a, wheel, mounted, into, two, or, three, gimbals, providing, pivoted, supports, for, allowing, the, wheel, to, rotate, about, a, single, axis, a, set, of, three, gimbals, one, mounted, on, the, other, with, orthogonal, pivot, axes, may, be, used, to, allow, a, wheel, mounted, on, the, innermost, gimbal, to, have, an, orientation, remaining, independent, of, the, orientation, in, space, of, its, support, in, the, case, of, a, gyroscope, with, two, gimbals, the, outer, gimbal, which, is, the, gyroscope, frame, is, mounted, so, as, to, pivot, about, an, axis, in, its, own, plane, determined, by, the, support, this, outer, gimbal, possesses, one, degree, of, rotational, freedom, and, its, axis, possesses, none, the, second, gimbal, inner, gimbal, is, mounted, in, the, gyroscope, frame, outer, gimbal, so, as, to, pivot, about, an, axis, in, its, own, plane, that, is, always, perpendicular, to, the, pivotal, axis, of, the, gyroscope, frame, outer, gimbal, this, inner, gimbal, has, two, degrees, of, rotational, freedom, the, axle, of, the, spinning, wheel, the, rotor, defines, the, spin, axis, the, rotor, is, constrained, to, spin, about, an, axis, which, is, always, perpendicular, to, the, axis, of, the, inner, gimbal, so, the, rotor, possesses, three, degrees, of, rotational, freedom, and, its, axis, possesses, two, the, rotor, responds, to, a, force, applied, to, the, input, axis, by, a, reaction, force, to, the, output, axis, a, gyroscope, flywheel, will, roll, or, resist, about, the, output, axis, depending, upon, whether, the, output, gimbals, are, of, a, free, or, fixed, configuration, an, example, of, some, free, output, gimbal, devices, is, the, attitude, control, gyroscopes, used, to, sense, or, measure, the, pitch, roll, and, yaw, attitude, angles, in, a, spacecraft, or, aircraft, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, rotor, can, be, in, a, fixed, position, the, rotor, simultaneously, spins, about, one, axis, and, is, capable, of, oscillating, about, the, two, other, axes, and, it, is, free, to, turn, in, any, direction, about, the, fixed, point, except, for, its, inherent, resistance, caused, by, rotor, spin, some, gyroscopes, have, mechanical, equivalents, substituted, for, one, or, more, of, the, elements, for, example, the, spinning, rotor, may, be, suspended, in, a, fluid, instead, of, being, mounted, in, gimbals, a, control, moment, gyroscope, cmg, is, an, example, of, a, fixed, output, gimbal, device, that, is, used, on, spacecraft, to, hold, or, maintain, a, desired, attitude, angle, or, pointing, direction, using, the, gyroscopic, resistance, force, in, some, special, cases, the, outer, gimbal, or, its, equivalent, may, be, omitted, so, that, the, rotor, has, only, two, degrees, of, freedom, in, other, cases, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, rotor, may, be, offset, from, the, axis, of, oscillation, and, thus, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, rotor, and, the, centre, of, suspension, of, the, rotor, may, not, coincide, essentially, a, gyroscope, is, a, top, combined, with, a, pair, of, gimbals, tops, were, invented, in, many, different, civilizations, including, classical, greece, rome, and, china, most, of, these, were, not, utilized, as, instruments, the, first, known, apparatus, similar, to, a, gyroscope, the, whirling, speculum, or, serson, s, speculum, was, invented, by, john, serson, in, 1743, it, was, used, as, a, level, to, locate, the, horizon, in, foggy, or, misty, conditions, the, first, instrument, used, more, like, an, actual, gyroscope, was, made, by, johann, bohnenberger, of, germany, who, first, wrote, about, it, in, 1817, at, first, he, called, it, the, machine, bohnenberger, s, machine, was, based, on, a, rotating, massive, sphere, in, 1832, american, walter, r, johnson, developed, a, similar, device, that, was, based, on, a, rotating, disc, the, french, mathematician, pierre, simon, laplace, working, at, the, cole, polytechnique, in, paris, recommended, the, machine, for, use, as, a, teaching, aid, and, thus, it, came, to, the, attention, of, l, on, foucault, in, 1852, foucault, used, it, in, an, experiment, demonstrating, the, rotation, of, the, earth, it, was, foucault, who, gave, the, device, its, modern, name, in, an, experiment, to, see, greek, skopeein, to, see, the, earth, s, rotation, greek, gyros, circle, or, rotation, which, was, visible, in, the, 8, to, 10, minutes, before, friction, slowed, the, spinning, rotor, in, the, 1860s, the, advent, of, electric, motors, made, it, possible, for, a, gyroscope, to, spin, indefinitely, this, led, to, the, first, prototype, heading, indicators, and, a, rather, more, complicated, device, the, gyrocompass, the, first, functional, gyrocompass, was, patented, in, 1904, by, german, inventor, hermann, ansch, tz, kaempfe, american, elmer, sperry, followed, with, his, own, design, later, that, year, and, other, nations, soon, realized, the, military, importance, of, the, invention, in, an, age, in, which, naval, prowess, was, the, most, significant, measure, of, military, power, and, created, their, own, gyroscope, industries, the, sperry, gyroscope, company, quickly, expanded, to, provide, aircraft, and, naval, stabilizers, as, well, and, other, gyroscope, developers, followed, suit, circa, 1911, the, l, t, hurst, mfg, co, of, indianapolis, started, producing, the, hurst, gyroscope, a, toy, gyroscope, with, a, pull, string, and, pedestal, manufacture, was, at, some, point, switched, to, chandler, mfg, co, still, branded, hurst, the, product, later, gets, renamed, to, a, chandler, gyroscope, presumably, because, chandler, mfg, co, took, over, rights, to, the, gyroscope, chandler, continued, to, produce, the, toy, until, the, company, was, purchased, by, tedco, inc, in, 1982, the, gyroscope, is, still, produced, by, tedco, today, in, the, first, several, decades, of, the, 20th, century, other, inventors, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, use, gyroscopes, as, the, basis, for, early, black, box, navigational, systems, by, creating, a, stable, platform, from, which, accurate, acceleration, measurements, could, be, performed, in, order, to, bypass, the, need, for, star, sightings, to, calculate, position, similar, principles, were, later, employed, in, the, development, of, inertial, navigation, systems, for, ballistic, missiles, during, world, war, ii, the, gyroscope, became, the, prime, component, for, aircraft, and, anti, aircraft, gun, sights, after, the, war, the, race, to, miniaturize, gyroscopes, for, guided, missiles, and, weapons, navigation, systems, resulted, in, the, development, and, manufacturing, of, so, called, midget, gyroscopes, that, weighed, less, than, 3, ounces, 85, g, and, had, a, diameter, of, approximately, 1, inch, 2, 5, cm, some, of, these, miniaturized, gyroscopes, could, reach, a, speed, of, 24, 000, revolutions, per, minute, in, less, than, 10, seconds, gyroscopes, continue, to, be, an, engineering, challenge, for, example, the, axle, bearings, have, to, be, extremely, accurate, a, small, amount, of, friction, is, deliberately, introduced, to, the, bearings, since, otherwise, an, accuracy, of, better, than, 10, 7, displaystyle, 10, 7, of, an, inch, 2, 5, nm, would, be, required, three, axis, mems, based, gyroscopes, are, also, being, used, in, portable, electronic, devices, such, as, tablets, smartphones, and, smartwatches, this, adds, to, the, 3, axis, acceleration, sensing, ability, available, on, previous, generations, of, devices, together, these, sensors, provide, 6, component, motion, sensing, accelerometers, for, x, y, and, z, movement, and, gyroscopes, for, measuring, the, extent, and, rate, of, rotation, in, space, roll, pitch, and, yaw, some, devices, additionally, incorporate, a, magnetometer, to, provide, absolute, angular, measurements, relative, to, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, newer, mems, based, inertial, measurement, units, incorporate, up, to, all, nine, axes, of, sensing, in, a, single, integrated, circuit, package, providing, inexpensive, and, widely, available, motion, sensing, all, spinning, objects, have, gyroscopic, properties, the, main, properties, that, an, object, can, experience, in, any, gyroscopic, motion, are, rigidity, in, space, and, precession, rigidity, in, space, describes, the, principle, that, a, gyroscope, remains, in, the, fixed, position, on, the, plane, in, which, it, is, spinning, unaffected, by, the, earth, s, rotation, for, example, a, bike, wheel, early, forms, of, gyroscope, not, then, known, by, the, name, were, used, to, demonstrate, the, principle, a, simple, case, of, precession, also, known, as, steady, precession, can, be, described, by, the, following, relation, to, moment, where, displaystyle, phi, represents, precession, displaystyle, psi, is, represented, by, spin, displaystyle, theta, is, the, nutation, angle, and, i, displaystyle, i, represents, inertia, along, its, respective, axis, this, relation, is, only, valid, with, the, moment, along, the, y, and, z, axes, are, equal, to, 0, the, equation, can, be, further, reduced, noting, that, the, angular, velocity, along, the, z, axis, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, precession, and, the, spin, z, cos, displaystyle, omega, z, phi, cos, theta, psi, where, z, displaystyle, omega, z, represents, the, angular, velocity, along, the, z, axis, or, gyroscopic, precession, is, torque, induced, it, is, the, rate, of, change, of, the, angular, momentum, that, is, produced, by, the, applied, torque, precession, produces, counterintuitive, dynamic, results, such, as, a, spinning, top, not, falling, over, precession, is, used, in, aerospace, applications, for, sensing, changes, of, attitude, and, direction, a, steadicam, rig, was, employed, during, the, filming, of, the, 1983, film, return, of, the, jedi, in, conjunction, with, two, gyroscopes, for, extra, stabilization, to, film, the, background, plates, for, the, speeder, bike, chase, steadicam, inventor, garrett, brown, operated, the, shot, walking, through, a, redwood, forest, running, the, camera, at, one, frame, per, second, when, projected, at, 24, frames, per, second, it, gave, the, impression, of, flying, through, the, air, at, perilous, speeds, the, heading, indicator, or, directional, gyro, has, an, axis, of, rotation, that, is, set, horizontally, pointing, north, unlike, a, magnetic, compass, it, does, not, seek, north, when, being, used, in, an, airplane, for, example, it, will, slowly, drift, away, from, north, and, will, need, to, be, reoriented, periodically, using, a, magnetic, compass, as, a, reference, unlike, a, directional, gyro, or, heading, indicator, a, gyrocompass, seeks, north, it, detects, the, rotation, of, the, earth, about, its, axis, and, seeks, the, true, north, rather, than, the, magnetic, north, gyrocompasses, usually, have, built, in, damping, to, prevent, overshoot, when, re, calibrating, from, sudden, movement, by, determining, an, object, s, acceleration, and, integrating, over, time, the, velocity, of, the, object, can, be, calculated, integrating, again, position, can, be, determined, the, simplest, accelerometer, is, a, weight, that, is, free, to, move, horizontally, which, is, attached, to, a, spring, and, a, device, to, measure, the, tension, in, the, spring, this, can, be, improved, by, introducing, a, counteracting, force, to, push, the, weight, back, and, to, measure, the, force, needed, to, prevent, the, weight, from, moving, a, more, complicated, design, consists, of, a, gyroscope, with, a, weight, on, one, of, the, axes, the, device, will, react, to, the, force, generated, by, the, weight, when, it, is, accelerated, by, integrating, that, force, to, produce, a, velocity, a, gyrostat, consists, of, a, massive, flywheel, concealed, in, a, solid, casing, its, behaviour, on, a, table, or, with, various, modes, of, suspension, or, support, serves, to, illustrate, the, curious, reversal, of, the, ordinary, laws, of, static, equilibrium, due, to, the, gyrostatic, behaviour, of, the, interior, invisible, flywheel, when, rotated, rapidly, the, first, gyrostat, was, designed, by, lord, kelvin, to, illustrate, the, more, complicated, state, of, motion, of, a, spinning, body, when, free, to, wander, about, on, a, horizontal, plane, like, a, top, spun, on, the, pavement, or, a, bicycle, on, the, road, kelvin, also, made, use, of, gyrostats, to, develop, mechanical, theories, of, the, elasticity, of, matter, and, of, the, ether, in, modern, continuum, mechanics, there, is, a, variety, of, these, models, based, on, ideas, of, lord, kelvin, they, represent, a, specific, type, of, cosserat, theories, suggested, for, the, first, time, by, eug, ne, cosserat, and, fran, ois, cosserat, which, can, be, used, for, description, of, artificially, made, smart, materials, as, well, as, of, other, complex, media, one, of, them, so, called, kelvin, s, medium, has, the, same, equations, as, magnetic, insulators, near, the, state, of, magnetic, saturation, in, the, approximation, of, quasimagnetostatics, in, modern, times, the, gyrostat, concept, is, used, in, the, design, of, attitude, control, systems, for, orbiting, spacecraft, and, satellites, for, instance, the, mir, space, station, had, three, pairs, of, internally, mounted, flywheels, known, as, gyrodynes, or, control, moment, gyros, in, physics, there, are, several, systems, whose, dynamical, equations, resemble, the, equations, of, motion, of, a, gyrostat, examples, include, a, solid, body, with, a, cavity, filled, with, an, inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous, liquid, the, static, equilibrium, configuration, of, a, stressed, elastic, rod, in, elastica, theory, the, polarization, dynamics, of, a, light, pulse, propagating, through, a, nonlinear, medium, the, lorenz, system, in, chaos, theory, and, the, motion, of, an, ion, in, a, penning, trap, mass, spectrometer, a, microelectromechanical, systems, mems, gyroscope, is, a, miniaturized, gyroscope, found, in, electronic, devices, it, takes, the, idea, of, the, foucault, pendulum, and, uses, a, vibrating, element, this, kind, of, gyroscope, was, first, used, in, military, applications, but, has, since, been, adopted, for, increasing, commercial, use, the, hemispherical, resonator, gyroscope, hrg, also, called, a, wine, glass, gyroscope, or, mushroom, gyro, makes, use, of, a, thin, solid, state, hemispherical, shell, anchored, by, a, thick, stem, this, shell, is, driven, to, a, flexural, resonance, by, electrostatic, forces, generated, by, electrodes, which, are, deposited, directly, onto, separate, fused, quartz, structures, that, surround, the, shell, gyroscopic, effect, is, obtained, from, the, inertial, property, of, the, flexural, standing, waves, a, vibrating, structure, gyroscope, vsg, also, called, a, coriolis, vibratory, gyroscope, cvg, uses, a, resonator, made, of, different, metallic, alloys, it, takes, a, position, between, the, low, accuracy, low, cost, mems, gyroscope, and, the, higher, accuracy, and, higher, cost, fiber, optic, gyroscope, accuracy, parameters, are, increased, by, using, low, intrinsic, damping, materials, resonator, vacuumization, and, digital, electronics, to, reduce, temperature, dependent, drift, and, instability, of, control, signals, high, quality, wine, glass, resonators, are, used, for, precise, sensors, like, hrg, a, dynamically, tuned, gyroscope, dtg, is, a, rotor, suspended, by, a, universal, joint, with, flexure, pivots, the, flexure, spring, stiffness, is, independent, of, spin, rate, however, the, dynamic, inertia, from, the, gyroscopic, reaction, effect, from, the, gimbal, provides, negative, spring, stiffness, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, spin, speed, howe, and, savet, 1964, lawrence, 1998, therefore, at, a, particular, speed, called, the, tuning, speed, the, two, moments, cancel, each, other, freeing, the, rotor, from, torque, a, necessary, condition, for, an, ideal, gyroscope, a, ring, laser, gyroscope, relies, on, the, sagnac, effect, to, measure, rotation, by, measuring, the, shifting, interference, pattern, of, a, beam, split, into, two, separate, beams, which, travel, around, the, ring, in, opposite, directions, when, the, boeing, 757, 200, entered, service, in, 1983, it, was, equipped, with, the, first, suitable, ring, laser, gyroscope, this, gyroscope, took, many, years, to, develop, and, the, experimental, models, went, through, many, changes, before, it, was, deemed, ready, for, production, by, the, engineers, and, managers, of, honeywell, and, boeing, it, was, an, outcome, of, the, competition, with, mechanical, gyroscopes, which, kept, improving, the, reason, honeywell, of, all, companies, chose, to, develop, the, laser, gyro, was, that, they, were, the, only, one, that, didn, t, have, a, successful, line, of, mechanical, gyroscopes, so, they, wouldn, t, be, competing, against, themselves, the, first, problem, they, had, to, solve, was, that, with, laser, gyros, rotations, below, a, certain, minimum, could, not, be, detected, at, all, due, to, a, problem, called, lock, in, whereby, the, two, beams, act, like, coupled, oscillators, and, pull, each, other, s, frequencies, toward, convergence, and, therefore, zero, output, the, solution, was, to, shake, the, gyro, rapidly, so, that, it, never, settled, into, lock, in, paradoxically, too, regular, of, a, dithering, motion, produced, an, accumulation, of, short, periods, of, lock, in, when, the, device, was, at, rest, at, the, extremities, of, its, shaking, motion, this, was, cured, by, applying, a, random, white, noise, to, the, vibration, the, material, of, the, block, was, also, changed, from, quartz, to, a, new, glass, ceramic, cer, vit, made, by, owens, corning, because, of, helium, leaks, a, fiber, optic, gyroscope, also, uses, the, interference, of, light, to, detect, mechanical, rotation, the, two, halves, of, the, split, beam, travel, in, opposite, directions, in, a, coil, of, fiber, optic, cable, as, long, as, 5, km, like, the, ring, laser, gyroscope, it, makes, use, of, the, sagnac, effect, a, london, moment, gyroscope, relies, on, the, quantum, mechanical, phenomenon, whereby, a, spinning, superconductor, generates, a, magnetic, field, whose, axis, lines, up, exactly, with, the, spin, axis, of, the, gyroscopic, rotor, a, magnetometer, determines, the, orientation, of, the, generated, field, which, is, interpolated, to, determine, the, axis, of, rotation, gyroscopes, of, this, type, can, be, extremely, accurate, and, stable, for, example, those, used, in, the, gravity, probe, b, experiment, measured, changes, in, gyroscope, spin, axis, orientation, to, better, than, 0, 5, milliarcseconds, 1, 4, 10, 7, degrees, or, about, 2, 4, 10, 9, radians, over, a, one, year, period, this, is, equivalent, to, an, angular, separation, the, width, of, a, human, hair, viewed, from, 32, kilometers, 20, mi, away, the, gp, b, gyro, consists, of, a, nearly, perfect, spherical, rotating, mass, made, of, fused, quartz, which, provides, a, dielectric, support, for, a, thin, layer, of, niobium, superconducting, material, to, eliminate, friction, found, in, conventional, bearings, the, rotor, assembly, is, centered, by, the, electric, field, from, six, electrodes, after, the, initial, spin, up, by, a, jet, of, helium, which, brings, the, rotor, to, 4, 000, rpm, the, polished, gyroscope, housing, is, evacuated, to, an, ultra, high, vacuum, to, further, reduce, drag, on, the, rotor, provided, the, suspension, electronics, remain, powered, the, extreme, rotational, symmetry, lack, of, friction, and, low, drag, will, allow, the, angular, momentum, of, the, rotor, to, keep, it, spinning, for, about, 15, 000, years, a, sensitive, dc, squid, that, can, discriminate, changes, as, small, as, one, quantum, or, about, 2, 10, 15, wb, is, used, to, monitor, the, gyroscope, a, precession, or, tilt, in, the, orientation, of, the, rotor, causes, the, london, moment, magnetic, field, to, shift, relative, to, the, housing, the, moving, field, passes, through, a, superconducting, pickup, loop, fixed, to, the, housing, inducing, a, small, electric, current, the, current, produces, a, voltage, across, a, shunt, resistance, which, is, resolved, to, spherical, coordinates, by, a, microprocessor, the, system, is, designed, to, minimize, lorentz, torque, on, the, rotor, the, main, rotor, of, a, helicopter, acts, like, a, gyroscope, its, motion, is, influenced, by, the, principle, of, gyroscopic, precession, which, is, the, concept, that, a, force, applied, to, a, spinning, object, will, have, a, maximum, reaction, approximately, 90, degrees, later, the, reaction, may, differ, from, 90, degrees, when, other, stronger, forces, are, in, play, to, change, direction, helicopters, must, adjust, the, pitch, angle, and, the, angle, of, attack, gyro, x, prototype, vehicle, created, by, alex, tremulis, and, thomas, summers, in, 1967, the, car, utilized, gyroscopic, precession, to, drive, on, two, wheels, an, assembly, consisting, of, a, flywheel, mounted, in, a, gimbal, housing, under, the, hood, of, the, vehicle, acted, as, a, large, gyroscope, the, flywheel, was, rotated, by, hydraulic, pumps, creating, a, gyroscopic, effect, on, the, vehicle, a, precessional, ram, was, responsible, for, rotating, the, gyroscope, to, change, the, direction, of, the, precessional, force, to, counteract, any, forces, causing, the, vehicle, imbalance, the, one, of, a, kind, prototype, is, now, at, the, lane, motor, museum, in, nashville, tennessee, in, addition, to, being, used, in, compasses, aircraft, computer, pointing, devices, etc, gyroscopes, have, been, introduced, into, consumer, electronics, since, the, gyroscope, allows, the, calculation, of, orientation, and, rotation, designers, have, incorporated, them, into, modern, technology, the, integration, of, the, gyroscope, has, allowed, for, more, accurate, recognition, of, movement, within, a, 3d, space, than, the, previous, lone, accelerometer, within, a, number, of, smartphones, gyroscopes, in, consumer, electronics, are, frequently, combined, with, accelerometers, for, more, robust, direction, and, motion, sensing, examples, of, such, applications, include, smartphones, such, as, the, samsung, galaxy, note, 4, htc, titan, nexus, 5, iphone, 5s, nokia, 808, pureview, and, sony, xperia, game, console, peripherals, such, as, the, playstation, 3, controller, and, the, wii, remote, and, virtual, reality, headsets, such, as, the, oculus, rift, nintendo, has, integrated, a, gyroscope, into, the, wii, console, s, wii, remote, controller, by, an, additional, piece, of, hardware, called, wii, motionplus, it, is, also, included, in, the, 3ds, wii, u, gamepad, and, nintendo, switch, joy, con, and, pro, controllers, which, detect, movement, when, turning, and, shaking, cruise, ships, use, gyroscopes, to, level, motion, sensitive, devices, such, as, self, leveling, pool, tables, an, electric, powered, flywheel, gyroscope, inserted, in, a, bicycle, wheel, is, sold, as, an, alternative, to, training, wheels, some, features, of, android, phones, like, photosphere, or, 360, camera, and, to, use, vr, gadget, do, not, work, without, a, gyroscope, sensor, in, the, phone
