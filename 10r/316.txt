a, sauna, s, n, s, a, n, finnish, estonian, is, a, room, or, building, designed, as, a, place, to, experience, dry, or, wet, heat, sessions, or, an, establishment, with, one, or, more, of, these, facilities, the, steam, and, high, heat, make, the, bathers, perspire, a, thermometer, in, a, sauna, is, typically, used, to, measure, temperature, a, hygrometer, can, be, used, to, measure, levels, of, humidity, or, steam, infrared, therapy, is, often, referred, to, as, a, type, of, sauna, but, according, to, the, finnish, sauna, organizations, infrared, is, not, a, sauna, areas, such, as, the, rocky, orkney, islands, of, scotland, have, many, ancient, stone, structures, for, normal, habitation, some, of, which, incorporate, areas, for, fire, and, bathing, it, is, possible, some, of, these, structures, also, incorporated, the, use, of, steam, in, a, way, similar, to, the, sauna, but, this, is, a, matter, of, speculation, the, sites, are, from, the, neolithic, age, dating, to, approximately, 4000, b, c, e, archaeological, sites, in, greenland, and, newfoundland, have, uncovered, structures, very, similar, to, traditional, scandinavian, farm, saunas, some, with, bathing, platforms, and, enormous, quantities, of, badly, scorched, stones, the, traditional, korean, sauna, called, the, hanjeungmak, is, a, domed, structure, constructed, of, stone, that, was, first, mentioned, in, the, sejong, sillok, of, the, annals, of, the, joseon, dynasty, in, the, 15th, century, supported, by, sejong, the, great, the, hanjeungmak, was, touted, for, its, health, benefits, and, used, to, treat, illnesses, in, the, early, 15th, century, buddhist, monks, maintained, hanjeungmak, clinics, called, hanjeungso, to, treat, sick, poor, people, these, clinics, maintained, separate, facilities, for, men, and, women, due, to, high, demand, korean, sauna, culture, and, kiln, saunas, are, still, popular, today, and, korean, saunas, are, ubiquitous, western, saunas, originated, in, finland, where, the, oldest, known, saunas, were, made, from, pits, dug, in, a, slope, in, the, ground, and, primarily, used, as, dwellings, in, winter, the, sauna, featured, a, fireplace, where, stones, were, heated, to, a, high, temperature, water, was, thrown, on, the, hot, stones, to, produce, steam, and, to, give, a, sensation, of, increased, heat, this, would, raise, the, apparent, temperature, so, high, that, people, could, take, off, their, clothes, the, first, finnish, saunas, were, always, of, a, type, now, called, savusauna, smoke, sauna, these, differed, from, present, day, saunas, in, that, they, were, operated, by, heating, a, pile, of, rocks, called, a, kiuas, by, burning, large, amounts, of, wood, for, about, 6, to, 8, hours, and, then, letting, out, the, smoke, before, enjoying, the, l, yly, a, finnish, term, meaning, collectively, both, the, steam, and, the, heat, of, a, sauna, same, term, in, estonian, is, leili, you, can, see, similarities, with, finnish, word, a, properly, heated, savusauna, yields, heat, for, up, to, 12, hours, as, a, result, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, sauna, evolved, to, use, a, wood, burning, metal, stove, with, rocks, on, top, kiuas, with, a, chimney, air, temperatures, averaged, around, 75, 100, c, 167, 212, f, but, sometimes, exceeded, 110, c, 230, f, in, a, traditional, finnish, sauna, as, the, finns, migrated, to, other, areas, of, the, globe, they, brought, their, sauna, designs, and, traditions, with, them, this, led, to, a, further, evolution, of, the, sauna, including, the, electric, sauna, stove, which, was, introduced, in, 1938, by, metos, ltd, in, vaasa, although, sauna, culture, is, more, or, less, related, to, finnish, and, estonian, culture, the, evolution, of, the, sauna, took, place, around, the, same, time, in, finland, and, baltic, countries, they, all, have, valued, the, sauna, its, customs, and, traditions, until, the, present, day, the, sauna, became, very, popular, especially, in, scandinavia, and, the, german, speaking, regions, of, europe, after, the, second, world, war, german, soldiers, had, experienced, finnish, saunas, during, their, fight, against, the, soviet, union, during, the, continuation, war, where, they, fought, on, the, same, side, saunas, were, so, important, to, finnish, soldiers, that, they, built, them, not, only, in, mobile, tents, but, even, in, bunkers, after, the, war, the, german, soldiers, brought, the, custom, back, to, germany, and, austria, where, it, became, popular, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, german, sauna, culture, also, became, popular, in, neighbouring, countries, such, as, switzerland, belgium, the, netherlands, and, luxembourg, sauna, culture, has, been, registered, in, the, representative, list, of, the, intangible, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, under, two, entries, smoke, sauna, tradition, in, v, romaa, in, 2014, and, sauna, culture, in, finland, in, 2020, the, word, sauna, is, an, ancient, finnish, word, referring, to, both, the, traditional, finnish, bath, and, to, the, bathhouse, itself, in, finnic, languages, other, than, finnish, and, estonian, sauna, and, cognates, do, not, necessarily, mean, a, building, or, space, built, for, bathing, it, can, also, mean, a, small, cabin, or, cottage, such, as, a, cabin, for, a, fisherman, the, word, is, the, best, known, finnicism, in, many, languages, the, sauna, known, in, the, western, world, today, originates, from, northern, europe, in, finland, there, are, built, in, saunas, in, almost, every, house, including, communal, saunas, in, the, older, apartment, buildings, since, the, 80s, private, saunas, have, often, been, built, into, the, bathrooms, of, typical, finnish, flats, in, apartment, buildings, sometimes, even, in, student, housing, there, are, also, a, number, of, public, saunas, in, finland, including, rajaportin, sauna, a, sauna, located, in, tampere, that, was, first, established, in, 1906, by, hermanni, and, maria, lahtinen, helsinki, even, has, a, sauna, built, into, one, of, the, gondolas, of, a, ferris, wheel, skywheel, helsinki, unlike, many, other, countries, finnish, people, usually, prefer, to, be, naked, instead, of, wearing, a, swimsuit, towel, or, other, kind, of, clothing, under, many, circumstances, temperatures, approaching, and, exceeding, 100, c, 212, f, would, be, completely, intolerable, and, possibly, fatal, to, a, person, exposed, to, them, for, long, periods, of, time, saunas, overcome, this, problem, by, controlling, the, humidity, the, hottest, finnish, saunas, have, relatively, low, humidity, levels, in, which, steam, is, generated, by, pouring, water, on, the, hot, stones, this, allows, air, temperatures, that, could, evaporate, water, to, be, tolerated, and, even, enjoyed, for, longer, periods, of, time, steam, baths, such, as, the, hammam, where, the, humidity, approaches, 100, will, be, set, to, a, much, lower, temperature, of, around, 50, c, 122, f, to, compensate, the, wet, heat, would, cause, scalding, if, the, temperature, were, set, much, higher, in, a, typical, finnish, sauna, the, temperature, of, the, air, the, room, and, the, benches, are, above, the, dew, point, even, when, water, is, thrown, on, the, hot, stones, and, vaporized, thus, they, remain, dry, in, contrast, the, sauna, bathers, are, at, about, 60, 80, c, 140, 176, f, which, is, below, the, dew, point, so, that, water, is, condensed, on, the, bathers, skin, this, process, releases, heat, and, makes, the, steam, feel, hot, finer, control, over, the, perceived, temperature, can, be, achieved, by, choosing, a, higher, level, bench, for, those, wishing, for, a, hotter, experience, or, a, lower, level, bench, for, a, more, moderate, temperature, a, good, sauna, has, a, relatively, small, temperature, gradient, between, the, various, seating, levels, doors, need, to, be, kept, closed, and, used, quickly, to, maintain, the, temperature, and, to, keep, the, steam, inside, some, north, american, western, european, japanese, russian, and, south, african, public, sport, center, and, gyms, include, sauna, facilities, they, may, also, be, present, at, public, and, private, swimming, pools, as, an, additional, facility, a, sauna, may, have, one, or, more, jacuzzi, in, some, spa, centers, there, are, the, so, called, special, snow, rooms, also, known, as, cold, saunas, or, cryotherapy, operating, at, a, temperature, of, 110, c, 166, f, the, user, is, in, the, sauna, for, a, period, of, only, about, 3, minutes, according, to, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, the, world, s, largest, sauna, is, the, koi, sauna, in, the, thermen, badewelt, sinsheim, germany, it, measures, 166, square, meters, holds, 150, people, and, sports, a, koi, aquarium, the, title, may, now, belong, to, cape, east, spa, in, haparanda, sweden, which, also, holds, 150, people, but, is, more, spacious, however, in, czeladz, south, poland, there, is, now, a, sauna, for, 300, people, sporting, light, shows, theatre, and, needing, several, sauna, masters, a, modern, sauna, with, an, electric, stove, usually, takes, about, 15, 30, minutes, to, heat, up, some, users, prefer, taking, a, shower, beforehand, to, speed, up, perspiration, in, the, sauna, when, in, the, sauna, people, often, sit, on, a, towel, for, hygiene, and, put, a, towel, over, their, heads, if, the, face, feels, too, hot, but, the, body, feels, comfortable, in, russia, a, felt, banya, hat, may, be, worn, to, shield, the, head, from, the, heat, this, allows, the, wearer, to, increase, the, heat, on, the, rest, of, the, body, the, temperature, of, one, s, bath, can, be, controlled, via, the, heat, is, greatest, closest, to, the, stove, heating, from, the, air, is, lower, on, the, lower, benches, as, the, hot, air, rises, the, heat, given, by, the, steam, can, be, very, different, in, different, parts, of, the, sauna, as, the, steam, rises, directly, upwards, it, spreads, across, the, roof, and, travels, out, towards, the, corners, where, it, is, then, forced, downwards, consequently, the, heat, of, fresh, steam, may, sometimes, be, felt, most, strongly, in, the, furthest, corners, of, the, sauna, users, increase, the, duration, and, the, heat, gradually, over, time, as, they, adapt, to, the, sauna, when, pouring, water, onto, the, stove, it, cools, down, the, rocks, but, carries, more, heat, into, the, air, via, advection, making, the, sauna, warmer, perspiration, is, the, result, of, autonomic, responses, trying, to, cool, the, body, users, are, advised, to, leave, the, sauna, if, the, heat, becomes, unbearable, or, if, they, feel, faint, or, ill, some, saunas, have, a, thermostat, to, adjust, the, temperature, but, the, owner, of, the, sauna, and, the, other, bathers, expect, to, be, consulted, before, changes, are, made, the, sauna, stove, and, rocks, are, very, hot, one, must, stay, well, clear, of, them, to, avoid, burns, particularly, when, water, is, thrown, on, the, rocks, which, creates, an, immediate, blast, of, steam, combustibles, on, or, near, the, stove, have, been, known, to, cause, fires, contact, lenses, dry, out, in, the, heat, jewelry, or, anything, metallic, including, glasses, will, get, hot, in, the, sauna, and, can, cause, discomfort, or, burning, the, temperature, on, different, parts, of, the, body, can, be, adjusted, by, shielding, one, s, body, with, a, towel, shielding, the, face, with, a, towel, has, been, found, to, reduce, the, perception, of, heat, some, may, wish, to, put, an, additional, towel, or, a, special, cap, over, the, head, to, avoid, dryness, few, people, can, sit, directly, in, front, of, the, stove, without, feeling, too, hot, from, the, radiant, heat, but, this, may, not, be, reflected, in, their, overall, body, temperature, as, the, person, s, body, is, often, the, coolest, object, in, a, sauna, room, steam, will, condense, into, water, on, the, skin, this, can, be, confused, with, perspiration, cooling, down, by, immersing, oneself, in, water, in, a, shower, lake, or, pool, is, a, part, of, the, sauna, cycle, and, is, as, important, as, the, heating, however, it, is, advisable, that, healthy, people, and, heart, patients, alike, should, take, some, precautions, if, plunging, into, very, cold, water, straight, after, coming, from, the, hot, room, as, the, rapid, cooling, of, the, body, produces, considerable, circulatory, stress, it, is, considered, good, practice, to, take, a, few, moments, after, exiting, a, sauna, before, entering, a, cold, plunge, and, to, enter, a, plunge, pool, or, a, lake, by, stepping, into, it, gradually, rather, than, immediately, immersing, oneself, fully, in, summer, a, session, is, often, started, with, a, cool, shower, in, some, countries, the, closest, and, most, convenient, access, to, a, sauna, is, at, a, gymnasium, some, public, pools, major, sports, centers, and, resorts, also, contain, a, sauna, therapeutic, sauna, sessions, are, often, carried, out, in, conjunction, with, physiotherapy, or, hydrotherapy, these, are, gentle, exercises, that, do, not, exacerbate, symptoms, there, has, been, widespread, research, into, the, health, benefits, and, risks, that, come, from, sauna, usage, most, studies, have, focused, on, the, finnish, sauna, specifically, sauna, bathing, leads, to, mild, heat, stress, which, activates, heat, shock, proteins, responsible, for, repairing, misfolded, proteins, promoting, longevity, as, well, as, protection, against, muscle, atrophy, and, chronic, illness, there, is, evidence, that, long, term, exposure, to, finnish, style, sauna, is, correlated, with, a, reduced, risk, of, sudden, cardiac, death, and, that, risk, reduction, increases, with, duration, and, frequency, of, use, this, reduction, is, more, pronounced, when, sauna, bathing, is, combined, with, exercise, compared, with, either, of, these, practices, alone, tentative, evidence, supports, that, the, heat, stress, from, saunas, is, associated, with, reduced, blood, pressure, and, arterial, stiffness, and, therefore, also, decrease, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, these, benefits, are, more, pronounced, in, persons, with, low, cardiovascular, function, evidence, exists, for, the, benefit, of, sauna, on, people, with, heart, failure, frequent, finnish, style, sauna, usage, 4, 7, times, per, week, is, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, of, neurovascular, diseases, including, alzheimer, s, disease, and, stroke, relative, to, those, individuals, who, used, sauna, once, per, week, individuals, suffering, from, musculoskeletal, disorders, could, have, symptomatic, improvement, from, sauna, and, it, could, be, beneficial, for, glaucoma, it, also, is, associated, with, a, reduced, risk, and, symptom, relief, from, the, symptoms, of, respiratory, illness, weight, loss, in, obese, people, and, improvement, of, appetite, loss, present, with, normal, body, weight, is, achievable, with, sauna, bathing, evidence, for, the, use, of, sauna, for, depression, or, skin, disorders, is, insufficient, but, the, frequency, of, sauna, sessions, is, correlated, with, a, diminished, risk, of, developing, psychosis, and, it, might, be, beneficial, for, psoriasis, sauna, bathing, coupled, with, alcohol, consumption, or, dehydration, increases, the, risk, of, sudden, death, the, use, of, narcotic, drugs, such, as, cocaine, also, increases, the, risk, being, severely, obese, having, high, blood, pressure, or, being, diabetic, all, serve, as, reasons, to, decrease, the, duration, of, sauna, sessions, individuals, prone, to, postural, hypotension, or, severe, valvular, heart, disease, should, use, sauna, cautiously, to, reduce, the, risk, of, a, drop, in, blood, pressure, in, people, with, cardiovascular, disease, sauna, usage, is, generally, safe, as, long, as, their, condition, is, stable, however, sauna, bathing, is, contraindicated, in, persons, with, unstable, angina, and, severe, aortic, stenosis, a, one, year, study, in, finland, showed, that, only, 67, 2, 6, of, sudden, deaths, in, saunas, were, non, accidental, mostly, due, to, coronary, heart, disease, pregnant, women, can, use, saunas, as, long, as, their, core, temperature, does, not, exceed, 39, 0, c, 102, 2, f, as, this, may, be, teratogenic, one, study, has, found, that, genital, heat, stress, from, frequent, sauna, sessions, could, cause, male, infertility, today, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, sauna, options, heat, sources, include, wood, electricity, gas, and, other, more, unconventional, methods, such, as, solar, power, there, are, wet, saunas, dry, saunas, infrared, saunas, smoke, saunas, and, steam, saunas, there, are, two, main, types, of, stoves, continuous, heating, and, heat, storage, type, continuously, heating, stoves, have, a, small, heat, capacity, and, can, be, heated, up, on, a, fast, on, demand, basis, whereas, a, heat, storage, stove, has, a, large, heat, stone, capacity, and, can, take, much, longer, to, heat, smoke, sauna, finnish, savusauna, estonian, suitsusaun, v, ro, savvusann, is, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, the, sauna, it, is, simply, a, room, containing, a, pile, of, rocks, but, without, a, chimney, a, fire, is, lit, directly, under, the, rocks, and, after, a, while, the, fire, is, extinguished, the, heat, retained, in, the, rocks, and, the, earlier, fire, becomes, the, main, source, for, heating, the, sauna, following, this, process, the, ashes, and, embers, are, removed, from, the, hearth, the, benches, and, floor, are, cleaned, and, the, room, is, allowed, to, air, out, and, freshen, for, a, period, of, time, the, smoke, deposits, a, layer, of, soot, on, every, surface, so, if, the, benches, and, back, rests, can, be, removed, while, the, fire, is, alight, the, amount, of, cleaning, necessary, is, reduced, depending, on, size, of, the, stove, and, the, airing, time, the, temperature, may, be, low, about, 60, c, 140, f, while, the, humidity, is, relatively, high, the, tradition, almost, died, out, in, finland, but, was, revived, by, enthusiasts, in, the, 1980s, these, are, still, used, in, present, day, finland, by, some, enthusiasts, but, usually, only, on, special, occasions, such, as, christmas, new, year, s, easter, and, juhannus, midsummer, smoke, saunas, are, popular, in, the, southern, estonia, and, smoke, sauna, tradition, in, v, rumaa, was, added, into, unesco, intangible, cultural, heritage, lists, in, 2014, the, smoke, sauna, stove, is, also, used, with, a, sealed, stone, compartment, and, chimney, a, heat, storage, stove, which, eliminates, the, smoke, odour, and, eye, irritation, of, the, smoke, sauna, a, heat, storage, stove, does, not, give, up, much, heat, in, the, sauna, before, bathing, since, the, stone, compartment, has, an, insulated, lid, when, the, sauna, bath, is, started, and, the, l, yly, shutter, opened, a, soft, warmth, flow, into, the, otherwise, relatively, cold, 60, c, 140, f, sauna, this, heat, is, soft, and, clean, because, thanks, to, combustion, the, stove, stones, glow, red, even, white, hot, and, are, freed, of, dust, at, the, same, time, when, bathing, the, heat, storage, sauna, will, become, as, hot, as, a, continuous, fire, type, sauna, 80, 110, c, 176, 230, f, but, more, humid, the, stones, are, usually, durable, heatproof, and, heat, retaining, peridotite, the, upper, part, of, the, stove, is, often, insulated, with, rock, wool, and, firebricks, heat, storing, stoves, are, also, found, with, electric, heating, with, similar, service, but, no, need, to, maintain, a, fire, a, continuous, fire, stove, instead, of, stored, heat, is, a, relatively, recent, invention, there, is, a, firebox, and, a, smokestack, and, stones, are, placed, in, a, compartment, directly, above, the, firebox, it, takes, a, shorter, time, to, heat, than, the, heat, storage, sauna, about, one, hour, a, fire, heated, sauna, requires, manual, labor, in, the, form, of, maintaining, the, fire, during, bathing, the, fire, can, also, be, seen, as, a, hazard, fire, heated, saunas, are, common, in, cottages, where, the, extra, work, of, maintaining, the, fire, is, not, a, problem, the, most, common, modern, sauna, types, are, those, with, electric, stoves, the, stones, are, heated, up, and, kept, on, temperature, using, electric, heating, elements, there, is, a, thermostat, and, a, timer, typically, with, eight, hours, maximum, delay, time, followed, by, one, hour, s, continuous, heating, time, on, the, stove, this, type, of, heating, is, generally, used, only, in, urban, saunas, far, infrared, saunas, utilize, infrared, light, to, generate, heat, unlike, traditional, saunas, that, heat, the, body, indirectly, through, the, air, or, by, conduction, from, heated, surfaces, far, infrared, saunas, use, infrared, panels, or, other, methods, like, a, sauna, blanket, that, emit, far, infrared, light, which, is, absorbed, by, the, surface, of, the, skin, the, heat, produced, by, far, infrared, saunas, is, generally, lower, making, it, more, tolerable, for, people, who, cannot, withstand, the, high, temperatures, of, traditional, saunas, infrared, heat, penetrates, more, deeply, into, fat, and, the, neuromuscular, system, resulting, in, a, more, vigorous, sweat, at, lower, temperature, than, traditional, saunas, these, effects, are, favorable, for, the, neuromuscular, system, to, recover, from, maximal, endurance, exercise, many, cultures, have, sweat, baths, though, some, have, more, spiritual, uses, while, others, are, purely, secular, in, ancient, rome, there, was, the, thermae, or, balneae, from, greek, balane, on, traits, of, which, survive, in, the, turkish, or, arab, hammam, and, in, the, victorian, turkish, bath, which, uses, only, hot, dry, air, in, the, americas, there, is, the, nahuatl, aztec, tem, zcalli, nahuatl, pronunciation, maya, zumpul, ch, and, the, mixtec, ihi, in, canada, and, the, united, states, a, number, of, first, nations, and, native, american, cultures, have, various, kinds, of, spiritual, sweat, lodges, lakota, inipi, anishinaabemowin, madoodiswan, in, europe, we, find, the, estonian, saun, almost, identical, to, the, finnish, sauna, russian, banya, latvian, pirts, the, european, jews, shvitz, and, the, swedish, bastu, in, asia, the, japanese, mushi, buro, and, the, korean, jjimjilbang, the, karo, people, of, indonesia, have, the, oukup, in, some, parts, of, africa, there, is, the, sifutu, although, cultures, in, all, corners, of, the, world, have, imported, and, adapted, the, sauna, many, of, the, traditional, customs, have, not, survived, the, journey, today, public, perception, of, saunas, sauna, etiquette, and, sauna, customs, vary, hugely, from, country, to, country, in, many, countries, sauna, going, is, a, recent, fashion, and, attitudes, towards, saunas, are, changing, while, in, others, traditions, have, survived, over, generations, in, africa, the, majority, of, sauna, facilities, are, found, in, a, more, upmarket, hotel, spa, and, health, club, environments, and, predominantly, share, both, sauna, heater, technology, and, design, concepts, as, applied, in, europe, even, though, outdoor, temperatures, remain, warmer, and, more, humid, this, does, not, affect, the, general, application, or, intended, sauna, experience, offered, within, these, commercial, environments, offering, a, traditional, sauna, and, or, steam, shower, experience, in, iran, most, gyms, hotels, and, almost, all, public, swimming, pools, have, indoor, saunas, it, is, very, common, for, swimming, pools, to, have, two, saunas, which, are, known, in, persian, as, dry, sauna, and, steam, sauna, with, the, dry, type, customarily, boasting, a, higher, temperature, a, cold, water, pool, and, or, more, recently, a, cold, jacuzzi, is, almost, always, accompanied, and, towels, are, usually, provided, adding, therapeutic, or, relaxing, essential, oils, to, the, rocks, is, common, in, iran, unlike, finland, sitting, in, a, sauna, is, mostly, seen, as, part, of, the, spa, club, culture, rather, than, a, bathing, ritual, it, is, most, usually, perceived, as, a, means, for, relaxation, or, detoxification, through, perspiration, having, a, sauna, room, on, private, property, is, considered, a, luxury, rather, than, a, necessity, public, saunas, are, segregated, and, nudity, is, prohibited, in, japan, many, saunas, exist, at, sports, centers, and, public, bathhouses, sent, the, saunas, are, almost, always, gender, separated, often, required, by, law, and, nudity, is, a, required, part, of, proper, sauna, etiquette, while, right, after, world, war, ii, public, bathhouses, were, commonplace, in, japan, the, number, of, customers, have, dwindled, as, more, people, were, able, to, afford, houses, and, apartments, equipped, with, their, own, private, baths, as, the, nation, became, wealthier, as, a, result, many, sent, s, have, added, more, features, such, as, saunas, in, order, to, survive, in, korea, saunas, are, essentially, public, bathhouses, various, names, are, used, to, describe, them, such, as, the, smaller, mogyoktang, outdoor, oncheon, and, the, elaborate, jjimjilbang, the, word, sauna, is, used, a, lot, for, its,
