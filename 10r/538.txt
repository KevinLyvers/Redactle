a, musket, is, a, muzzle, loaded, long, gun, that, appeared, as, a, smoothbore, weapon, in, the, early, 16th, century, at, first, as, a, heavier, variant, of, the, arquebus, capable, of, penetrating, plate, armour, by, the, mid, 16th, century, this, type, of, musket, gradually, disappeared, as, the, use, of, heavy, armour, declined, but, musket, continued, as, the, generic, term, for, smoothbore, long, guns, until, the, mid, 19th, century, in, turn, this, style, of, musket, was, retired, in, the, 19th, century, when, rifled, muskets, simply, called, rifles, in, modern, terminology, using, the, mini, ball, invented, by, claude, tienne, mini, in, 1849, became, common, the, development, of, breech, loading, firearms, using, self, contained, cartridges, introduced, by, casimir, lefaucheux, in, 1835, and, the, first, reliable, repeating, rifles, produced, by, winchester, repeating, arms, company, in, 1860, also, led, to, their, demise, by, the, time, that, repeating, rifles, became, common, they, were, known, as, simply, rifles, ending, the, era, of, the, musket, according, to, the, online, etymology, dictionary, firearms, were, often, named, after, animals, and, the, word, musket, derived, from, the, french, word, mousquette, which, is, a, male, sparrowhawk, an, alternative, theory, is, that, derives, from, the, 16th, century, french, mousquet, ette, from, the, italian, moschetti, etta, meaning, the, bolt, of, a, crossbow, the, italian, moschetti, is, a, diminutive, of, mosca, a, fly, the, first, recorded, usage, of, the, term, musket, or, moschetti, appeared, in, europe, in, the, year, 1499, evidence, of, the, musket, as, a, type, of, firearm, does, not, appear, until, 1521, when, it, was, used, to, describe, a, heavy, arquebus, capable, of, penetrating, heavy, armour, this, version, of, the, musket, fell, out, of, use, after, the, mid, 16th, century, with, the, decline, of, heavy, armour, however, the, term, itself, stuck, around, as, a, general, descriptor, for, shoulder, arms, fire, weapons, into, the, 19th, century, the, differences, between, the, arquebus, and, musket, post, 16th, century, are, therefore, not, entirely, clear, and, the, two, have, been, used, interchangeably, on, several, occasions, according, to, historian, david, a, parrot, the, concept, of, the, musket, as, a, legitimate, innovation, is, uncertain, and, may, consist, of, nothing, more, than, a, name, change, trigger, guards, began, appearing, in, 1575, bayonets, were, attached, to, muskets, in, several, parts, of, the, world, from, the, late, 16th, to, 17th, centuries, locks, came, in, many, different, varieties, early, matchlock, and, wheel, lock, mechanisms, were, replaced, by, later, flintlock, mechanisms, and, finally, percussion, locks, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, china, and, japan, the, flintlock, mechanism, never, caught, on, and, they, continued, using, matchlocks, until, the, 19th, century, when, percussion, locks, were, introduced, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, several, improvements, were, added, to, the, musket, in, 1750, a, detent, was, added, to, prevent, the, sear, from, catching, in, the, half, cock, notch, a, roller, bearing, was, introduced, in, 1770, to, reduce, friction, and, increase, sparks, in, 1780, waterproof, pans, were, added, the, phrase, lock, stock, and, barrel, refers, to, the, three, main, parts, of, a, musket, sixteenth, and, 17th, century, musketeers, used, bandoliers, which, held, their, pre, measured, charges, and, lead, balls, the, mini, ball, which, despite, its, name, was, actually, bullet, shaped, and, not, ball, shaped, was, developed, in, the, 1840s, the, mini, ball, had, an, expanding, skirt, which, was, intended, to, be, used, with, rifled, barrels, leading, to, what, was, called, the, rifled, musket, which, came, into, widespread, use, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, mini, ball, was, small, enough, in, diameter, that, it, could, be, loaded, as, quickly, as, a, round, ball, even, with, a, barrel, that, had, been, fouled, with, black, powder, residue, after, firing, many, shots, and, the, expanding, skirt, of, the, mini, ball, meant, that, it, would, still, form, a, tight, fit, with, the, barrel, and, impart, a, good, spin, into, the, round, when, fired, this, gave, the, rifled, musket, an, effective, range, of, several, hundred, yards, which, was, a, significant, improvement, over, the, smooth, bore, musket, for, example, combat, ranges, of, 300, yd, 270, m, were, achievable, using, the, rifled, muskets, during, the, american, civil, war, musketeers, often, used, paper, cartridges, which, served, a, purpose, similar, to, that, of, modern, metallic, cartridges, in, combining, bullet, and, powder, charge, a, musket, cartridge, consisted, of, a, pre, measured, amount, of, black, powder, and, ammunition, such, as, a, round, ball, nessler, ball, or, mini, ball, all, wrapped, up, in, paper, cartridges, would, then, be, placed, in, a, cartridge, box, which, would, typically, be, worn, on, the, musketeer, s, belt, during, a, battle, unlike, a, modern, cartridge, this, paper, cartridge, was, not, simply, loaded, into, the, weapon, and, fired, instead, the, musketeer, would, tear, open, the, paper, usually, with, his, teeth, pour, some, of, the, powder, into, the, pan, and, the, rest, into, the, barrel, follow, it, with, the, ammunition, and, the, paper, as, wadding, if, not, using, a, mini, ball, then, use, the, ramrod, as, normal, to, push, it, all, into, the, barrel, while, not, as, fast, as, loading, a, modern, cartridge, this, method, did, significantly, speed, up, the, loading, process, since, the, pre, measured, charges, meant, that, the, musketeer, did, not, have, to, carefully, measure, out, the, black, powder, with, every, shot, some, ramrods, were, equipped, with, threaded, ends, allowing, different, attachments, to, be, used, one, of, the, more, common, attachments, was, a, ball, screw, or, ball, puller, which, was, a, screw, that, could, be, screwed, into, the, lead, ball, to, remove, it, if, it, had, become, jammed, in, the, barrel, similar, to, the, way, that, a, corkscrew, is, used, to, remove, a, wine, cork, another, attachment, was, called, a, worm, which, was, used, to, clear, debris, from, the, barrel, such, as, paper, wadding, that, had, not, been, expelled, some, worm, designs, were, sturdy, enough, that, they, could, be, used, to, remove, stuck, ammunition, the, worm, could, also, be, used, with, a, small, piece, of, cloth, for, cleaning, a, variation, on, the, worm, called, the, screw, and, wiper, combined, the, typical, design, of, a, worm, with, a, ball, puller, s, screw, the, heavy, arquebus, known, as, the, musket, appeared, in, europe, by, 1521, in, response, to, firearms, thicker, armour, was, produced, from, 15, kg, 33, lb, 1, oz, in, the, 15th, century, to, 25, kg, 55, lb, 2, oz, in, the, late, 16th, century, armour, that, was, 2, mm, 0, 079, in, thick, required, nearly, three, times, as, much, energy, to, penetrate, as, did, armour, that, was, only, 1, mm, 0, 039, in, thick, during, the, siege, of, parma, in, 1521, many, spanish, soldiers, reportedly, used, an, arquebus, with, rest, a, weapon, much, larger, and, more, powerful, than, the, regular, arquebus, however, at, this, point, long, barrelled, musket, calibre, weapons, had, been, in, use, as, wall, defence, weapons, in, europe, for, almost, a, century, the, musketeers, were, the, first, infantry, to, give, up, armour, entirely, musketeers, began, to, take, cover, behind, walls, or, in, sunken, lanes, and, sometimes, acted, as, skirmishers, to, take, advantage, of, their, ranged, weapons, in, england, the, musket, barrel, was, cut, down, from, 4, ft, 1, 2, m, to, 3, ft, 0, 91, m, around, 1630, the, number, of, musketeers, relative, to, pikemen, increased, partly, because, they, were, now, more, mobile, than, pikemen, muskets, of, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, were, accurate, enough, to, hit, a, target, of, 50, cm, 20, in, in, diameter, at, a, distance, of, 100, m, 330, ft, at, the, same, distance, musket, bullets, could, penetrate, a, steel, bib, about, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, thick, or, a, wooden, shield, about, 130, mm, 5, 1, in, thick, the, maximum, range, of, the, bullet, was, 1, 100, m, 1, 200, yd, the, speed, of, the, bullets, was, between, 450, and, 540, m, s, 1, 500, and, 1, 800, ft, s, and, the, kinetic, energy, was, 3, 000, 4, 000, j, 2, 200, 3, 000, ft, lbf, the, heavy, musket, went, out, of, favour, around, the, same, time, the, snaphance, flintlock, was, invented, in, europe, in, 1550, the, snaphance, was, followed, by, the, true, flintlock, in, the, late, 17th, century, while, the, heavy, variant, of, the, arquebus, died, out, due, to, the, decline, of, heavy, armour, the, term, musket, itself, stuck, around, as, a, general, term, for, shoulder, arms, fireweapons, replacing, arquebus, and, remained, until, the, 1800s, the, differences, between, the, arquebus, and, musket, post, 16th, century, are, therefore, not, entirely, clear, and, the, two, have, been, used, interchangeably, on, several, occasions, flintlocks, are, not, usually, associated, with, arquebuses, a, variation, of, the, musket, known, as, the, caliver, a, standardized, calibre, spelled, caliber, in, the, us, appeared, in, europe, around, 1567, 9, according, to, jacob, de, gheyn, the, caliver, was, a, smaller, musket, that, did, not, require, a, fork, rest, benerson, little, described, it, as, a, light, musket, matchlock, firearms, were, used, in, india, by, 1500, in, i, vi, t, by, 1516, and, in, southeast, asia, by, 1540, according, to, a, burmese, source, from, the, late, 15th, century, king, minkhaung, ii, would, not, dare, attack, the, besieged, town, of, prome, due, to, the, defenders, use, of, cannon, and, small, arms, that, were, described, as, muskets, although, these, were, probably, early, matchlock, arquebuses, or, wall, guns, the, portuguese, may, have, introduced, muskets, to, sri, lanka, during, their, conquest, of, the, coastline, and, lowlands, in, 1505, as, they, regularly, used, short, barrelled, matchlocks, during, combat, however, p, e, p, deraniyagala, points, out, that, the, sinhalese, term, for, gun, bondikula, matches, the, arabic, term, for, gun, bunduk, also, certain, technical, aspects, of, the, early, sri, lankan, matchlock, were, similar, to, the, matchlocks, used, in, the, middle, east, thus, forming, the, generally, accepted, theory, that, the, musket, was, not, entirely, new, to, the, island, by, the, time, the, portuguese, came, in, any, case, soon, native, sri, lankan, kingdoms, most, notably, the, kingdom, of, sitawaka, and, the, kingdom, of, kandy, manufactured, hundreds, of, lankan, muskets, with, a, unique, bifurcated, stock, longer, barrel, and, smaller, calibre, which, made, it, more, efficient, in, directing, and, using, the, energy, of, the, gunpowder, these, were, mastered, by, the, sri, lankan, soldiers, to, the, point, where, according, to, the, portuguese, chronicler, queir, s, they, could, fire, at, night, to, put, out, a, match, and, by, day, at, 60, paces, would, sever, a, knife, with, four, or, five, bullets, and, send, as, many, on, the, same, spot, in, the, target, despite, initial, reluctance, the, safavid, empire, of, persia, rapidly, acquired, the, art, of, making, and, using, handguns, a, venetian, envoy, vincenzo, di, alessandri, in, a, report, presented, to, the, council, of, ten, on, 24, september, 1572, observed, they, used, for, arms, swords, lances, arquebuses, which, all, the, soldiers, carry, and, use, their, arms, are, also, superior, and, better, tempered, than, those, of, any, other, nation, the, barrels, of, the, arquebuses, are, generally, six, spans, long, and, carry, a, ball, little, less, than, three, ounces, in, weight, they, use, them, with, such, facility, that, it, does, not, hinder, them, drawing, their, bows, nor, handling, their, swords, keeping, the, latter, hung, at, their, saddle, bows, till, occasion, requires, them, the, arquebus, is, then, put, away, behind, the, back, so, that, one, weapon, does, not, impede, the, use, of, the, other, during, the, sengoku, period, of, japan, arquebuses, were, introduced, by, portuguese, merchantmen, from, the, region, of, alentejo, in, 1543, and, by, the, 1560s, were, being, mass, produced, locally, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, production, of, firearms, in, japan, reached, enormous, proportions, which, allowed, for, a, successful, military, operation, in, korea, during, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, korean, chief, state, councillor, ryu, seong, ryong, noted, the, clear, superiority, of, the, japanese, musketeers, over, the, korean, archers, in, the, 1592, invasion, everything, was, swept, away, within, a, fortnight, or, a, month, the, cities, and, fortresses, were, lost, and, everything, in, the, eight, directions, had, crumbled, although, it, was, due, to, there, having, been, a, century, of, peace, and, the, people, not, being, familiar, with, warfare, that, this, happened, it, was, really, because, the, japanese, had, the, use, of, muskets, that, could, reach, beyond, several, hundred, paces, that, always, pierced, what, they, struck, that, came, like, the, wind, and, the, hail, and, with, which, bows, and, arrows, could, not, compare, arquebuses, were, imported, by, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, at, an, uncertain, point, but, the, ming, only, began, fielding, matchlocks, in, 1548, the, chinese, used, the, term, bird, gun, to, refer, to, arquebuses, and, turkish, arquebuses, may, have, reached, china, before, portuguese, ones, in, zhao, shizhen, s, book, of, 1598, ad, the, shenqipu, there, were, illustrations, of, ottoman, turkish, musketeers, with, detailed, illustrations, of, their, muskets, alongside, european, musketeers, with, detailed, illustrations, of, their, muskets, there, was, also, illustration, and, description, of, how, the, chinese, had, adopted, the, ottoman, kneeling, position, in, firing, while, using, european, made, muskets, though, zhao, shizhen, described, the, turkish, muskets, as, being, superior, to, the, european, muskets, the, wu, pei, chih, 1621, later, described, turkish, muskets, that, used, a, rack, and, pinion, mechanism, which, was, not, known, to, have, been, used, in, any, european, or, chinese, firearms, at, the, time, in, korea, the, joseon, dynasty, underwent, a, devastating, war, with, the, newly, unified, japan, that, lasted, from, 1592, to, 1598, the, shock, of, this, encounter, spurred, the, court, to, undergo, a, process, of, military, strengthening, one, of, the, core, elements, of, military, strengthening, was, to, adopt, the, musket, according, to, reformers, in, recent, times, in, china, they, did, not, have, muskets, they, first, learned, about, them, from, the, wokou, pirates, in, zhejiang, province, qi, jiguang, trained, troops, in, their, use, for, several, years, until, they, became, one, of, the, skills, of, the, chinese, who, subsequently, used, them, to, defeat, the, japanese, by, 1607, korean, musketeers, had, been, trained, in, the, fashion, which, qi, jiguang, prescribed, and, a, drill, manual, had, been, produced, based, on, the, chinese, leader, s, jixiao, xinshu, of, the, volley, fire, the, manual, says, that, every, musketeer, squad, should, either, divide, into, two, musketeers, per, layer, or, one, and, deliver, fire, in, five, volleys, or, in, ten, another, korean, manual, produced, in, 1649, describes, a, similar, process, when, the, enemy, approaches, to, within, a, hundred, paces, a, signal, gun, is, fired, and, a, conch, is, blown, at, which, the, soldiers, stand, then, a, gong, is, sounded, the, conch, stops, blowing, and, the, heavenly, swan, is, sounded, at, which, the, musketeers, fire, in, concert, either, all, at, once, or, in, five, volleys, this, training, method, proved, to, be, quite, formidable, in, the, 1619, battle, of, sarhu, in, which, 10, 000, korean, musketeers, managed, to, kill, many, manchus, before, their, allies, surrendered, while, korea, went, on, to, lose, both, wars, against, the, manchu, invasions, of, 1627, and, 1636, their, musketeers, were, well, respected, by, manchu, leaders, it, was, the, first, qing, emperor, hong, taiji, who, wrote, the, koreans, are, incapable, on, horseback, but, do, not, transgress, the, principles, of, the, military, arts, they, excel, at, infantry, fighting, especially, in, musketeer, tactics, afterwards, the, qing, dynasty, requested, joseon, to, aid, in, their, border, conflict, with, russia, in, 1654, 370, russians, engaged, a, 1, 000, man, qing, joseon, force, at, the, mouth, of, the, songhua, river, and, were, defeated, by, joseon, musketeers, in, 1658, five, hundred, russians, engaged, a, 1, 400, strong, qing, joseon, force, and, were, defeated, again, by, joseon, musketeers, under, the, three, branch, system, similar, to, the, spanish, tercio, joseon, organized, their, army, under, firearm, troops, artillery, and, musketeers, archers, and, pikemen, or, swordsmen, the, percentage, of, firearms, in, the, joseon, army, rose, dramatically, as, a, result, of, the, shorter, training, period, for, firearms, in, addition, the, sulphur, mines, discovered, in, jinsan, reduced, the, expense, of, producing, gunpowder, under, the, reign, of, sukjong, of, joseon, 1700s, 76, 4, of, the, local, standing, army, in, chungcheong, were, musketeers, under, the, reign, of, king, yeongjo, yoon, pil, un, commander, of, the, sua, chung, improved, on, firearms, with, the, chunbochong, which, had, a, greater, range, of, fire, than, the, existing, ones, its, usage, is, thought, to, have, been, similar, to, the, afghan, jezail, or, american, long, rifle, during, the, musket, wars, period, in, new, zealand, between, 1805, and, 1843, at, least, 500, conflicts, took, place, between, various, m, ori, tribes, often, using, trade, muskets, in, addition, to, traditional, m, ori, weapons, the, muskets, were, initially, cheap, birmingham, muskets, designed, for, the, use, of, coarse, grain, black, powder, maori, favoured, the, shorter, barrel, versions, some, tribes, took, advantage, of, runaway, sailors, and, escaped, convicts, to, expand, their, understanding, of, muskets, early, missionaries, one, of, whom, was, a, trained, gunsmith, refused, to, help, m, ori, repair, muskets, later, common, practice, was, to, enlarge, the, percussion, hole, and, to, hold, progressively, smaller, lead, balls, between, the, fingers, so, that, muskets, could, fire, several, shots, without, having, to, remove, fouling, likewise, m, ori, resorted, to, thumping, the, butt, of, the, musket, on, the, ground, to, settle, the, ball, instead, of, using, a, ramrod, m, ori, favoured, the, use, of, the, double, barrel, shot, gun, tuparra, two, barrel, during, fighting, often, using, women, to, reload, the, weapons, when, fighting, from, a, p, fortified, village, or, hillfort, they, often, resorted, to, using, nails, stones, or, anything, convenient, as, shot, from, the, 1850s, m, ori, were, able, to, obtain, superior, military, style, muskets, with, greater, range, one, of, the, authors, was, a, pakeha, european, who, lived, among, m, ori, spoke, the, language, fluently, had, a, m, ori, wife, and, took, part, in, many, intertribal, conflicts, as, a, warrior, the, musket, was, a, smoothbore, firearm, and, lacked, rifling, grooves, that, would, have, spun, the, bullet, in, such, a, way, as, to, increase, its, accuracy, the, last, contact, with, the, musket, barrel, gives, the, ball, a, spin, around, an, axis, at, right, angles, to, the, direction, of, flight, the, aerodynamics, result, in, the, ball, veering, off, in, a, random, direction, from, the, aiming, point, the, practice, of, rifling, putting, grooves, in, the, barrel, of, a, weapon, causing, the, projectile, to, spin, on, the, same, axis, as, the, line, of, flight, prevented, this, veering, off, from, the, aiming, point, rifles, already, existed, in, europe, by, the, late, 15th, century, but, they, were, primarily, used, as, sporting, weapons, and, had, little, presence, in, warfare, the, problem, with, rifles, was, the, tendency, for, powder, fouling, to, accumulate, in, the, rifling, making, the, piece, more, difficult, to, load, with, each, shot, eventually, the, weapon, could, not, be, loaded, until, the, bore, was, wiped, clean, for, this, reason, smoothbore, muskets, remained, the, primary, firearm, of, most, armies, until, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, not, until, 1611, that, rifles, started, seeing, some, limited, usage, in, warfare, by, denmark, around, 1750, rifles, began, to, be, used, by, skirmishers, of, frederick, the, great, recruited, in, 1744, from, a, j, ger, unit, of, game, keepers, and, foresters, but, the, rifle, s, slow, rate, of, fire, still, restricted, their, usage, the, invention, of, the, mini, ball, in, 1849, solved, both, major, problems, of, muzzle, loading, rifles, rifled, muskets, of, the, mid, 19th, century, like, the, springfield, model, 1861, which, dealt, heavy, casualties, at, the, battle, of, four, lakes, were, significantly, more, accurate, with, the, ability, to, hit, a, man, sized, target, at, a, distance, of, 500, yards, 460, m, or, more, the, smoothbore, musket, generally, allowed, no, more, than, 300, yards, 270, m, with, any, accuracy, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, saw, the, first, widespread, use, of, the, rifled, musket, for, the, common, infantryman, and, by, the, time, of, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, most, infantry, were, equipped, with, the, rifled, musket, these, were, far, more, accurate, than, smoothbore, muskets, and, had, a, far, longer, range, while, preserving, the, musket, s, comparatively, faster, reloading, rate, their, use, led, to, a, decline, in, the, use, of, massed, attacking, formations, as, these, formations, were, too, vulnerable, to, the, accurate, long, range, fire, a, rifle, could, produce, in, particular, attacking, troops, were, within, range, of, the, defenders, for, a, longer, period, of, time, and, the, defenders, could, also, fire, at, them, more, quickly, than, before, as, a, result, while, 18th, century, attackers, would, only, be, within, range, of, the, defenders, weapons, for, the, time, it, would, take, to, fire, a, few, shots, late, 19th, century, attackers, might, suffer, dozens, of, volleys, before, they, drew, close, to, the, defenders, with, correspondingly, high, casualty, rates, however, the, use, of, massed, attacks, on, fortified, positions, were, not, immediately, replaced, with, new, tactics, and, as, a, result, major, wars, of, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, tended, to, produce, very, high, casualty, figures, many, soldiers, preferred, to, reduce, the, standard, musket, reloading, procedures, to, increase, the, speed, of, fire, this, statement, is, from, thomas, anburey, who, served, as, a, lieutenant, in, burgoyne, s, army, here, i, cannot, help, observing, to, you, whether, it, proceeded, from, an, idea, of, self, preservation, or, natural, instinct, but, the, soldiers, greatly, improved, the, mode, they, were, taught, in, as, to, expedition, for, as, soon, as, they, had, primed, their, pieces, and, put, the, cartridge, into, the, barrel, instead, of, ramming, it, down, with, their, rods, they, struck, the, butt, end, of, the, piece, upon, the, ground, and, bringing, it, to, the, present, fired, it, off, this, practice, was, known, as, tap, loading, as, muskets, became, the, default, weapon, of, armies, the, slow, reloading, time, became, an, increasing, problem, the, difficulty, of, reloading, and, thus, the, time, needed, to, do, it, was, diminished, by, making, the, musket, ball, much, smaller, than, the, internal, diameter, of, the, barrel, so, as, the, interior, of, the, barrel, became, dirty, from, soot, from, previously, fired, rounds, the, musket, ball, from, the, next, shot, could, still, be, easily, rammed, to, keep, the, ball, in, place, once, the, weapon, was, loaded, it, would, be, partially, wrapped, in, a, small, piece, of, cloth, however, the, smaller, ball, could, move, within, the, barrel, as, the, musket, was, fired, decreasing, the, accuracy, of, musket, fire, it, was, complained, that, it, took, a, man, s, weight, in, lead, musket, balls, to, kill, him, the, development, of, volley, fire, by, the, ottomans, the, chinese, the, japanese, and, the, dutch, made, muskets, more, feasible, for, widespread, adoption, by, the, military, the, volley, fire, technique, transformed, soldiers, carrying, firearms, into, organized, firing, squads, with, each, row, of, soldiers, firing, in, turn, and, reloading, in, a, systematic, fashion, volley, fire, was, implemented, with, cannons, as, early, as, 1388, by, ming, artillerists, but, volley, fire, with, matchlocks, was, not, implemented, until, 1526, when, the, ottoman, janissaries, used, it, during, the, battle, of, moh, cs, the, matchlock, volley, fire, technique, was, next, seen, in, mid, 16th, century, china, as, pioneered, by, qi, jiguang, and, in, late, 16th, century, japan, qi, jiguang, elaborates, on, his, countermarch, volley, fire, technique, in, the, jixiao, xinshu, all, the, musketeers, when, they, get, near, the, enemy, are, not, allowed, to, fire, early, and, they, re, not, allowed, to, just, fire, everything, off, in, one, go, whenever, the, enemy, then, approaches, close, there, won, t, be, enough, time, to, load, the, guns, and, frequently, this, mismanagement, costs, the, lives, of, many, people, thus, whenever, the, enemy, gets, to, within, a, hundred, paces, distance, they, are, to, wait, until, they, hear, a, blast, on, the, bamboo, flute, at, which, they, deploy, themselves, in, front, of, the, troops, with, each, platoon, putting, in, front, one, team, they, wait, until, they, hear, their, own, leader, fire, a, shot, and, only, then, are, they, allowed, to, give, fire, each, time, the, trumpet, gives, a, blast, they, fire, one, time, spread, out, in, battle, array, according, to, the, drilling, patterns, if, the, trumpet, keeps, blasting, without, stopping, then, they, are, allowed, to, fire, all, together, until, their, fire, is, exhausted, and, it, s, not, necessary, to, divide, into, layers, frederick, lewis, taylor, claims, that, a, kneeling, volley, fire, may, have, been, employed, by, prospero, colonna, s, arquebusiers, as, early, as, the, battle, of, bicocca, 1522, however, this, has, been, called, into, question, by, tonio, andrade, who, believes, this, is, an, over, interpretation, as, well, as, mis, citation, of, a, passage, by, charles, oman, suggesting, that, the, spanish, arquebusiers, kneeled, to, reload, when, in, fact, oman, never, made, such, a, claim, this, is, contested, by, idan, sherer, who, quotes, paolo, giovio, saying, that, the, arquebusiers, kneeled, to, reload, so, that, the, second, line, of, arquebusiers, could, fire, without, endangering, those, in, front, of, them, european, gunners, might, have, implemented, countermarch, to, some, extent, since, at, least, 1579, when, the, englishman, thomas, digges, suggested, that, musketeers, should, after, the, old, romane, manner, make, three, or, four, several, fronts, with, convenient, spaces, for, the, first, to, retire, and, unite, himselfe, with, the, second, and, both, these, if, occasion, so, require, with, the, third, the, shot, having, their, convenient, lanes, continually, during, the, fight, to, discharge, their, peces, the, spanish, too, displayed, some, awareness, of, the, volley, technique, mart, n, de, eguiluz, described, it, in, the, military, manual, milicia, discurso, y, regla, militar, dating, to, 1586, start, with, three, files, of, five, soldiers, each, separated, one, from, the, other, by, fifteen, paces, and, they, should, comport, themselves, not, with, fury, but, with, calm, skillfulness, such, that, when, the, first, file, has, finished, shooting, they, make, space, for, the, next, which, is, coming, up, to, shoot, without, turning, face, countermarching, to, the, left, but, showing, the, enemy, only, the, side, of, their, bodies, which, is, the, narrowest, of, the, body, and, about, one, to, three, steps, behind, with, five, or, six, pellets, in, their, mouths, and, two, lighted, matchlock, fuses, and, they, load, promptly, and, return, to, shoot, when, it, s, their, turn, again, most, historians, including, geoffrey, parker, have, ignored, eguiluz, and, have, erroneously, attributed, the, invention, of, the, countermarch, to, maurice, of, nassau, although, the, publication, of, the, milicia, discurso, y, regla, militar, antedates, maurice, s, first, letter, on, the, subject, by, two, years, regardless, it, is, clear, that, the, concept, of, volley, fire, had, existed, in, europe, for, quite, some, time, during, the, 16th, century, but, it, was, in, the, netherlands, during, the, 1590s, that, the, musketry, volley, really, took, off, the, key, to, this, development, was, william, louis, count, of, nassau, dillenburg, who, in, 1594, described, the, technique, in, a, letter, to, his, cousin, i, have, discovered, a, method, of, getting, the, musketeers, and, soldiers, armed, with, arquebuses, not, only, to, keep, firing, very, well, but, to, do, it, effectively, in, battle, order, in, the, following, manner, as, soon, as, the, first, rank, has, fired, together, then, by, the, drill, they, will, march, to, the, back, the, second, rank, either, marching, forward, or, standing, still, fire, together, then, march, to, the, back, after, that, the, third, and, following, ranks, will, do, the, same, thus, before, the, last, ranks, have, fired, the, first, will, have, reloaded, in, the, 18th, century, regular, light, infantry, began, to, emerge, in, contrast, to, the, front, line, infantry, they, fought, in, the, loose, formation, used, natural, shelters, and, terrain, folds, in, addition, they, were, better, prepared, to, target, single, targets, this, type, of, troops, was, designed, to, fight, against, irregular, enemy, troops, such, as, militia, guerrillas, and, natives, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, number, of, light, infantry, increased, dramatically, in, the, french, army, light, infantry, accounted, for, 25, of, the, infantry, in, the, russian, army, 50, light, infantry, regiments, and, one, company, in, each, battalion, were, formed, which, accounted, for, about, 40, of, light, infantry, in, the, entire, infantry, in, the, 19th, century, a, new, tactic, was, devised, by, the, french, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, this, was, the, colonne, d, attaque, or, attack, column, consisting, of, one, regiment, up, to, two, brigades, of, infantry, instead, of, advancing, slowly, all, across, the, battlefield, in, line, formations, the, french, infantry, were, brought, forward, in, such, columns, preceded, by, masses, of, skirmishers, to, cover, and, mask, their, advance, the, column, would, then, normally, deploy, into, line, right, before, engaging, the, enemy, with, either, fire, or, bayonet, this, allowed, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, infantry, a, much, greater, degree, of, mobility, compared, to, their, ancien, r, gime, opponents, and, also, allowed, much, closer, cooperation, of, infantry, with, cavalry, and, artillery, which, were, free, to, move, in, between, the, infantry, columns, of, the, former, rather, than, being, trapped, in, between, the, linear, formation, of, the, latter, the, colonne, d, attaque, was, henceforth, adopted, by, all, european, armies, during, and, after, the, napoleonic, wars, while, some, british, historians, such, as, sir, charles, oman, have, postulated, that, it, was, the, standard, french, tactic, to, charge, enemy, lines, of, infantry, head, on, with, their, columns, relying, on, the, morale, effect, of, the, huge, column, and, hence, were, often, beaten, off, by, the, devastating, firepower, of, the, redcoats, more, current, research, into, the, subject, has, revealed, that, such, occasions, were, far, from, the, norm, and, that, the, french, normally, tried, deploying, into, lines, before, combat, as, well
