in, engineering, a, foundation, is, the, element, of, a, structure, which, connects, it, to, the, ground, or, more, rarely, water, as, with, floating, structures, transferring, loads, from, the, structure, to, the, ground, foundations, are, generally, considered, either, shallow, or, deep, foundation, engineering, is, the, application, of, soil, mechanics, and, rock, mechanics, geotechnical, engineering, in, the, design, of, foundation, elements, of, structures, foundations, provide, the, structure, s, stability, from, the, ground, the, design, and, the, construction, of, a, well, performing, foundation, must, possess, some, basic, requirements, buildings, and, structures, have, a, long, history, of, being, built, with, wood, in, contact, with, the, ground, post, in, ground, construction, may, technically, have, no, foundation, timber, pilings, were, used, on, soft, or, wet, ground, even, below, stone, or, masonry, walls, in, marine, construction, and, bridge, building, a, crisscross, of, timbers, or, steel, beams, in, concrete, is, called, grillage, perhaps, the, simplest, foundation, is, the, padstone, a, single, stone, which, both, spreads, the, weight, on, the, ground, and, raises, the, timber, off, the, ground, staddle, stones, are, a, specific, type, of, padstone, dry, stone, and, stones, laid, in, mortar, to, build, foundations, are, common, in, many, parts, of, the, world, dry, laid, stone, foundations, may, have, been, painted, with, mortar, after, construction, sometimes, the, top, visible, course, of, stone, is, hewn, quarried, stones, besides, using, mortar, stones, can, also, be, put, in, a, gabion, one, disadvantage, is, that, if, using, regular, steel, rebars, the, gabion, would, last, much, less, long, than, when, using, mortar, due, to, rusting, using, weathering, steel, rebars, could, reduce, this, disadvantage, somewhat, rubble, trench, foundations, are, a, shallow, trench, filled, with, rubble, or, stones, these, foundations, extend, below, the, frost, line, and, may, have, a, drain, pipe, which, helps, groundwater, drain, away, they, are, suitable, for, soils, with, a, capacity, of, more, than, 10, tonnes, m, 2, 2, 000, pounds, per, square, foot, often, called, footings, are, usually, embedded, about, a, meter, or, so, into, soil, one, common, type, is, the, spread, footing, which, consists, of, strips, or, pads, of, concrete, or, other, materials, which, extend, below, the, frost, line, and, transfer, the, weight, from, walls, and, columns, to, the, soil, or, bedrock, another, common, type, of, shallow, foundation, is, the, slab, on, grade, foundation, where, the, weight, of, the, structure, is, transferred, to, the, soil, through, a, concrete, slab, placed, at, the, surface, slab, on, grade, foundations, can, be, reinforced, mat, slabs, which, range, from, 25, cm, to, several, meters, thick, depending, on, the, size, of, the, building, or, post, tensioned, slabs, which, are, typically, at, least, 20, cm, for, houses, and, thicker, for, heavier, structures, another, way, to, install, ready, to, build, foundations, that, is, more, environmentally, friendly, is, to, use, screw, piles, screw, pile, installations, have, also, extended, to, residential, applications, with, many, homeowners, choosing, a, screw, pile, foundation, over, other, options, some, common, applications, for, helical, pile, foundations, include, wooden, decks, fences, garden, houses, pergolas, and, carports, used, to, transfer, the, load, of, a, structure, down, through, the, upper, weak, layer, of, topsoil, to, the, stronger, layer, of, subsoil, below, there, are, different, types, of, deep, footings, including, impact, driven, piles, drilled, shafts, caissons, screw, piles, geo, piers, and, earth, stabilized, columns, the, naming, conventions, for, different, types, of, footings, vary, between, different, engineers, historically, piles, were, wood, later, steel, reinforced, concrete, and, pre, tensioned, concrete, a, type, of, deep, foundation, which, uses, a, single, generally, large, diameter, structural, element, embedded, into, the, earth, to, support, all, the, loads, weight, wind, etc, of, a, large, above, surface, structure, many, monopile, foundations, have, been, used, in, recent, years, for, economically, constructing, fixed, bottom, offshore, wind, farms, in, shallow, water, subsea, locations, for, example, a, single, wind, farm, off, the, coast, of, england, went, online, in, 2008, with, over, 100, turbines, each, mounted, on, a, 4, 74, meter, diameter, monopile, footing, in, ocean, depths, up, to, 16, meters, of, water, a, floating, foundation, is, one, that, sits, on, a, body, of, water, rather, than, dry, land, this, type, of, foundation, is, used, for, some, bridges, and, floating, buildings, foundations, are, designed, to, have, an, adequate, load, capacity, depending, on, the, type, of, subsoil, rock, supporting, the, foundation, by, a, geotechnical, engineer, and, the, footing, itself, may, be, designed, structurally, by, a, structural, engineer, the, primary, design, concerns, are, settlement, and, bearing, capacity, when, considering, settlement, total, settlement, and, differential, settlement, is, normally, considered, differential, settlement, is, when, one, part, of, a, foundation, settles, more, than, another, part, this, can, cause, problems, to, the, structure, which, the, foundation, is, supporting, expansive, clay, soils, can, also, cause, problems
