a, windmill, is, a, structure, that, converts, wind, power, into, rotational, energy, using, vanes, called, sails, or, blades, by, tradition, specifically, to, mill, grain, gristmills, but, in, some, parts, of, the, english, speaking, world, the, term, has, also, been, extended, to, encompass, windpumps, wind, turbines, and, other, applications, the, term, wind, engine, is, also, sometimes, used, to, describe, such, devices, windmills, were, used, throughout, the, high, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, the, horizontal, or, panemone, windmill, first, appeared, in, persia, during, the, 9th, century, and, the, vertical, windmill, first, appeared, in, northwestern, europe, in, the, 12th, century, regarded, as, an, icon, of, dutch, culture, there, are, approximately, 1, 000, windmills, in, the, netherlands, today, wind, powered, machines, may, have, been, known, earlier, but, there, is, no, clear, evidence, of, windmills, before, the, 9th, century, hero, of, alexandria, heron, in, first, century, roman, egypt, described, what, appears, to, be, a, wind, driven, wheel, to, power, a, machine, his, description, of, a, wind, powered, organ, is, not, a, practical, windmill, but, was, either, an, early, wind, powered, toy, or, a, design, concept, for, a, wind, powered, machine, that, may, or, may, not, have, been, a, working, device, as, there, is, ambiguity, in, the, text, and, issues, with, the, design, another, early, example, of, a, wind, driven, wheel, was, the, prayer, wheel, which, is, believed, to, have, been, first, used, in, tibet, and, china, though, there, is, uncertainty, over, the, date, of, its, first, appearance, which, could, have, been, either, c, 400, the, 7th, century, or, after, the, 9th, century, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, working, windmill, designs, found, was, invented, sometime, around, 700, 900, ad, in, persia, this, design, was, the, panemone, with, vertical, lightweight, wooden, sails, attached, by, horizontal, struts, to, a, central, vertical, shaft, it, was, first, built, to, pump, water, and, subsequently, modified, to, grind, grain, as, well, the, first, practical, windmills, were, panemone, windmills, using, sails, that, rotated, in, a, horizontal, plane, around, a, vertical, axis, made, of, six, to, 12, sails, covered, in, reed, matting, or, cloth, material, these, windmills, were, used, to, grind, grain, or, draw, up, water, a, medieval, account, reports, that, windmill, technology, was, used, in, persia, and, the, middle, east, during, the, reign, of, rashidun, caliph, umar, ibn, al, khattab, r, 634, 644, based, on, the, caliph, s, conversation, with, a, persian, builder, slave, the, authenticity, of, part, of, the, anecdote, involving, the, caliph, umar, is, questioned, because, it, was, recorded, only, in, the, 10th, century, the, persian, geographer, estakhri, reported, windmills, being, operated, in, khorasan, eastern, iran, and, western, afghanistan, already, in, the, 9th, century, such, windmills, were, in, widespread, use, across, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, and, later, spread, to, europe, china, and, india, from, there, by, the, 11th, century, the, vertical, axle, windmill, had, reached, parts, of, southern, europe, including, the, iberian, peninsula, via, al, andalus, and, the, aegean, sea, in, the, balkans, a, similar, type, of, horizontal, windmill, with, rectangular, blades, used, for, irrigation, can, also, be, found, in, thirteenth, century, china, during, the, jurchen, jin, dynasty, in, the, north, introduced, by, the, travels, of, yel, chucai, to, turkestan, in, 1219, vertical, axle, windmills, were, built, in, small, numbers, in, europe, during, the, 18th, and, nineteenth, centuries, for, example, fowler, s, mill, at, battersea, in, london, and, hooper, s, mill, at, margate, in, kent, these, early, modern, examples, seem, not, to, have, been, directly, influenced, by, the, vertical, axle, windmills, of, the, medieval, period, but, to, have, been, independent, inventions, by, 18th, century, engineers, the, horizontal, axis, or, vertical, windmill, so, called, due, to, the, plane, of, the, movement, of, its, sails, is, a, development, of, the, 12th, century, first, used, in, northwestern, europe, in, the, triangle, of, northern, france, eastern, england, and, flanders, it, is, unclear, whether, the, vertical, windmill, was, influenced, by, the, introduction, of, the, horizontal, windmill, from, persia, middle, east, to, southern, europe, in, the, preceding, century, the, earliest, certain, reference, to, a, windmill, in, northern, europe, assumed, to, have, been, of, the, vertical, type, dates, from, 1185, in, the, former, village, of, weedley, in, yorkshire, which, was, located, at, the, southern, tip, of, the, wold, overlooking, the, humber, estuary, several, earlier, but, less, certainly, dated, 12th, century, european, sources, referring, to, windmills, have, also, been, found, these, earliest, mills, were, used, to, grind, cereals, the, evidence, at, present, is, that, the, earliest, type, of, european, windmill, was, the, post, mill, so, named, because, of, the, large, upright, post, on, which, the, mill, s, main, structure, the, body, or, buck, is, balanced, by, mounting, the, body, this, way, the, mill, can, rotate, to, face, the, wind, direction, an, essential, requirement, for, windmills, to, operate, economically, in, north, western, europe, where, wind, directions, are, variable, the, body, contains, all, the, milling, machinery, the, first, post, mills, were, of, the, sunken, type, where, the, post, was, buried, in, an, earth, mound, to, support, it, later, a, wooden, support, was, developed, called, the, trestle, this, was, often, covered, over, or, surrounded, by, a, roundhouse, to, protect, the, trestle, from, the, weather, and, to, provide, storage, space, this, type, of, windmill, was, the, most, common, in, europe, until, the, 19th, century, when, more, powerful, tower, and, smock, mills, replaced, them, in, a, hollow, post, mill, the, post, on, which, the, body, is, mounted, is, hollowed, out, to, accommodate, the, drive, shaft, this, makes, it, possible, to, drive, machinery, below, or, outside, the, body, while, still, being, able, to, rotate, the, body, into, the, wind, hollow, post, mills, driving, scoop, wheels, were, used, in, the, netherlands, to, drain, wetlands, since, the, early, 15th, century, onwards, by, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, the, masonry, tower, mill, on, which, only, the, cap, is, rotated, rather, than, the, whole, body, of, the, mill, had, been, introduced, the, spread, of, tower, mills, came, with, a, growing, economy, that, called, for, larger, and, more, stable, sources, of, power, though, they, were, more, expensive, to, build, in, contrast, to, the, post, mill, only, the, cap, of, the, tower, mill, needs, to, be, turned, into, the, wind, so, the, main, structure, can, be, made, much, taller, allowing, the, sails, to, be, made, longer, which, enables, them, to, provide, useful, work, even, in, low, winds, the, cap, can, be, turned, into, the, wind, either, by, winches, or, gearing, inside, the, cap, or, from, a, winch, on, the, tail, pole, outside, the, mill, a, method, of, keeping, the, cap, and, sails, into, the, wind, automatically, is, by, using, a, fantail, a, small, windmill, mounted, at, right, angles, to, the, sails, at, the, rear, of, the, windmill, these, are, also, fitted, to, tail, poles, of, post, mills, and, are, common, in, great, britain, and, english, speaking, countries, of, the, former, british, empire, denmark, and, germany, but, rare, in, other, places, around, some, parts, of, the, mediterranean, sea, tower, mills, with, fixed, caps, were, built, because, the, wind, s, direction, varied, little, most, of, the, time, the, smock, mill, is, a, later, development, of, the, tower, mill, where, the, masonry, tower, is, replaced, by, a, wooden, framework, called, the, smock, which, is, thatched, boarded, or, covered, by, other, materials, such, as, slate, sheet, metal, or, tar, paper, the, smock, is, commonly, of, octagonal, plan, though, there, are, examples, with, different, numbers, of, sides, smock, windmills, were, introduced, by, the, dutch, in, the, 17th, century, to, overcome, the, limitations, of, tower, windmills, which, were, expensive, to, build, and, could, not, be, erected, on, wet, surfaces, the, lower, half, of, the, smock, windmill, was, made, of, brick, while, the, upper, half, was, made, of, wood, with, a, sloping, tower, shape, that, added, structural, strength, to, the, design, this, made, them, lightweight, and, able, to, be, erected, on, unstable, ground, the, smock, windmill, design, included, a, small, turbine, in, the, back, that, helped, the, main, mill, to, face, the, direction, of, the, wind, common, sails, consist, of, a, lattice, framework, on, which, the, sailcloth, is, spread, the, miller, can, adjust, the, amount, of, cloth, spread, according, to, the, wind, and, the, power, needed, in, medieval, mills, the, sailcloth, was, wound, in, and, out, of, a, ladder, type, arrangement, of, sails, later, mill, sails, had, a, lattice, framework, over, which, the, sailcloth, was, spread, while, in, colder, climates, the, cloth, was, replaced, by, wooden, slats, which, were, easier, to, handle, in, freezing, conditions, the, jib, sail, is, commonly, found, in, mediterranean, countries, and, consists, of, a, simple, triangle, of, cloth, wound, round, a, spar, in, all, cases, the, mill, needs, to, be, stopped, to, adjust, the, sails, inventions, in, great, britain, in, the, late, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, led, to, sails, that, automatically, adjust, to, the, wind, speed, without, the, need, for, the, miller, to, intervene, culminating, in, patent, sails, invented, by, william, cubitt, in, 1807, in, these, sails, the, cloth, is, replaced, by, a, mechanism, of, connected, shutters, in, france, pierre, th, ophile, berton, invented, a, system, consisting, of, longitudinal, wooden, slats, connected, by, a, mechanism, that, lets, the, miller, open, them, while, the, mill, is, turning, in, the, twentieth, century, increased, knowledge, of, aerodynamics, from, the, development, of, the, airplane, led, to, further, improvements, in, efficiency, by, german, engineer, bilau, and, several, dutch, millwrights, the, majority, of, windmills, have, four, sails, multiple, sailed, mills, with, five, six, or, eight, sails, were, built, in, great, britain, especially, in, and, around, the, counties, of, lincolnshire, and, yorkshire, germany, and, less, commonly, elsewhere, earlier, multiple, sailed, mills, are, found, in, spain, portugal, greece, parts, of, romania, bulgaria, and, russia, a, mill, with, an, even, number, of, sails, has, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, run, with, a, damaged, sail, by, removing, both, the, damaged, sail, and, the, one, opposite, which, does, not, unbalance, the, mill, in, the, netherlands, the, stationary, position, of, the, sails, i, e, when, the, mill, is, not, working, has, long, been, used, to, give, signals, if, the, blades, are, stopped, in, a, sign, 3, 6, 9, 12, o, clock, the, windmill, is, open, for, business, when, the, blades, are, stopped, in, an, x, configuration, the, windmill, is, closed, or, not, functional, a, slight, tilt, of, the, sails, top, blade, at, 1, o, clock, signals, joy, such, as, the, birth, of, a, healthy, baby, a, tilt, of, the, blades, to, 11, 2, 5, 8, o, clock, signals, mourning, or, warning, it, was, used, to, signal, the, local, region, during, nazi, operations, in, world, war, ii, such, as, searches, for, jews, across, the, netherlands, windmills, were, placed, in, mourning, positions, in, honor, of, the, dutch, victims, of, the, 2014, malaysian, airlines, flight, 17, shootdown, gears, inside, a, windmill, convey, power, from, the, rotary, motion, of, the, sails, to, a, mechanical, device, the, sails, are, carried, on, the, horizontal, windshaft, windshafts, can, be, wholly, made, of, wood, wood, with, a, cast, iron, pole, end, where, the, sails, are, mounted, or, entirely, of, cast, iron, the, brake, wheel, is, fitted, onto, the, windshaft, between, the, front, and, rear, bearings, it, has, the, brake, around, the, outside, of, the, rim, and, teeth, in, the, side, of, the, rim, which, drives, the, horizontal, gearwheel, called, wallower, on, the, top, end, of, the, vertical, upright, shaft, in, grist, mills, the, great, spur, wheel, lower, down, the, upright, shaft, drives, one, or, more, stone, nuts, on, the, shafts, driving, each, millstone, post, mills, sometimes, have, a, head, and, or, tail, wheel, driving, the, stone, nuts, directly, instead, of, the, spur, gear, arrangement, additional, gear, wheels, drive, a, sack, hoist, or, other, machinery, the, machinery, differs, if, the, windmill, is, used, for, other, applications, than, milling, grain, a, drainage, mill, uses, another, set, of, gear, wheels, on, the, bottom, end, of, the, upright, shaft, to, drive, a, scoop, wheel, or, archimedes, screw, sawmills, uses, a, crankshaft, to, provide, a, reciprocating, motion, to, the, saws, windmills, have, been, used, to, power, many, other, industrial, processes, including, papermills, threshing, mills, and, to, process, oil, seeds, wool, paints, and, stone, products, in, the, 14th, century, windmills, became, popular, in, europe, the, total, number, of, wind, powered, mills, is, estimated, to, have, been, around, 200, 000, at, the, peak, in, 1850, which, is, close, to, half, of, the, some, 500, 000, water, wheels, windmills, were, applied, in, regions, where, there, was, too, little, water, where, rivers, freeze, in, winter, and, in, flat, lands, where, the, flow, of, the, river, was, too, slow, to, provide, the, required, power, with, the, coming, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, importance, of, wind, and, water, as, primary, industrial, energy, sources, declined, and, they, were, eventually, replaced, by, steam, in, steam, mills, and, internal, combustion, engines, although, windmills, continued, to, be, built, in, large, numbers, until, late, in, the, nineteenth, century, more, recently, windmills, have, been, preserved, for, their, historic, value, in, some, cases, as, static, exhibits, when, the, antique, machinery, is, too, fragile, to, be, put, in, motion, and, other, cases, as, fully, working, mills, of, the, 10, 000, windmills, in, use, in, the, netherlands, around, 1850, about, 1, 000, are, still, standing, most, of, these, are, being, run, by, volunteers, though, some, grist, mills, are, still, operating, commercially, many, of, the, drainage, mills, have, been, appointed, as, a, backup, to, the, modern, pumping, stations, the, zaan, district, has, been, said, to, have, been, the, first, industrialized, region, of, the, world, with, around, 600, operating, wind, powered, industries, by, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, economic, fluctuations, and, the, industrial, revolution, had, a, much, greater, impact, on, these, industries, than, on, grain, and, drainage, mills, so, only, very, few, are, left, construction, of, mills, spread, to, the, cape, colony, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, early, tower, mills, did, not, survive, the, gales, of, the, cape, peninsula, so, in, 1717, the, heeren, xvii, sent, carpenters, masons, and, materials, to, construct, a, durable, mill, the, mill, completed, in, 1718, became, known, as, the, oude, molen, and, was, located, between, pinelands, station, and, the, black, river, long, since, demolished, its, name, lives, on, as, that, of, a, technical, school, in, pinelands, by, 1863, cape, town, had, 11, mills, stretching, from, paarden, eiland, to, mowbray, a, wind, turbine, is, a, windmill, like, structure, specifically, developed, to, generate, electricity, they, can, be, seen, as, the, next, step, in, the, development, of, the, windmill, the, first, wind, turbines, were, built, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, by, james, blyth, in, scotland, 1887, charles, f, brush, in, cleveland, ohio, 1887, 1888, and, poul, la, cour, in, denmark, 1890s, la, cour, s, mill, from, 1896, later, became, the, local, power, of, the, village, of, askov, by, 1908, there, were, 72, wind, driven, electric, generators, in, denmark, ranging, from, 5, to, 25, kw, by, the, 1930s, windmills, were, widely, used, to, generate, electricity, on, farms, in, the, united, states, where, distribution, systems, had, not, yet, been, installed, built, by, companies, such, as, jacobs, wind, wincharger, miller, airlite, universal, aeroelectric, paris, dunn, airline, and, winpower, the, dunlite, corporation, produced, turbines, for, similar, locations, in, australia, forerunners, of, modern, horizontal, axis, utility, scale, wind, generators, were, the, wime, 3d, in, service, in, balaklava, ussr, from, 1931, until, 1942, a, 100, kw, generator, on, a, 30, metre, 98, ft, tower, the, smith, putnam, wind, turbine, built, in, 1941, on, the, mountain, known, as, grandpa, s, knob, in, castleton, vermont, united, states, of, 1, 25, mw, and, the, nasa, wind, turbines, developed, from, 1974, through, the, mid, 1980s, the, development, of, these, 13, experimental, wind, turbines, pioneered, many, of, the, wind, turbine, design, technologies, in, use, today, including, steel, tube, towers, variable, speed, generators, composite, blade, materials, and, partial, span, pitch, control, as, well, as, aerodynamic, structural, and, acoustic, engineering, design, capabilities, the, modern, wind, power, industry, began, in, 1979, with, the, serial, production, of, wind, turbines, by, danish, manufacturers, kuriant, vestas, nordtank, and, bonus, these, early, turbines, were, small, by, today, s, standards, with, capacities, of, 20, 30, kw, each, since, then, commercial, turbines, have, increased, greatly, in, size, with, the, enercon, e, 126, capable, of, delivering, up, to, 7, mw, while, wind, turbine, production, has, expanded, to, many, countries, as, the, 21st, century, began, rising, concerns, over, energy, security, global, warming, and, eventual, fossil, fuel, depletion, led, to, an, expansion, of, interest, in, all, available, forms, of, renewable, energy, worldwide, many, thousands, of, wind, turbines, are, now, operating, with, a, total, nameplate, capacity, of, 591, gw, as, of, 2018, in, an, attempt, to, make, wind, turbines, more, efficient, and, increase, their, energy, output, they, are, being, built, bigger, with, taller, towers, and, longer, blades, and, being, increasingly, deployed, in, offshore, locations, while, such, changes, increase, their, power, output, they, subject, the, components, of, the, windmills, to, stronger, forces, and, consequently, put, them, at, a, greater, risk, of, failure, taller, towers, and, longer, blades, suffer, from, higher, fatigue, and, offshore, windfarms, are, subject, to, greater, forces, due, to, higher, wind, speeds, and, accelerated, corrosion, due, to, the, proximity, to, seawater, to, ensure, a, long, enough, lifetime, to, make, the, return, on, the, investment, viable, the, materials, for, the, components, must, be, chosen, appropriately, the, blade, of, a, wind, turbine, consists, of, 4, main, elements, the, root, spar, aerodynamic, fairing, and, surfacing, the, fairing, is, composed, of, two, shells, one, on, the, pressure, side, and, one, on, the, suction, side, connected, by, one, or, more, webs, linking, the, upper, and, lower, shells, the, webs, connect, to, the, spar, laminates, which, are, enclosed, within, the, skins, surfacing, of, the, blade, and, together, the, system, of, the, webs, and, spars, resist, the, flapwise, loading, flapwise, loading, one, of, the, two, different, types, of, loading, that, blades, are, subject, to, is, caused, by, the, wind, pressure, and, edgewise, loading, the, second, type, of, loading, is, caused, by, the, gravitational, force, and, torque, load, the, former, loading, subjects, the, spar, laminate, on, the, pressure, upwind, side, of, the, blade, to, cyclic, tension, tension, loading, while, the, suction, downwind, side, of, the, blade, is, subject, to, cyclic, compression, compression, loading, edgewise, bending, subjects, the, leading, edge, to, a, tensile, load, and, the, trailing, edge, to, a, compressive, load, the, remainder, of, the, shell, not, supported, by, the, spars, or, laminated, at, the, leading, and, trailing, edges, is, designed, as, a, sandwiched, structure, consisting, of, multiple, layers, to, prevent, elastic, buckling, in, addition, to, meeting, the, stiffness, strength, and, toughness, requirements, determined, by, the, loading, the, blade, needs, to, be, lightweight, and, the, weight, of, the, blade, scales, with, the, cube, of, its, radius, to, determine, which, materials, fit, the, criteria, described, above, a, parameter, known, as, the, beam, merit, index, is, defined, mb, e, 1, 2, rho, where, e, is, young, s, modulus, and, rho, is, the, density, the, best, blade, materials, are, carbon, fiber, and, glass, fiber, reinforced, polymers, cfrp, and, gfrp, currently, gfrp, materials, are, chosen, for, their, lower, cost, despite, the, much, greater, figure, of, merit, of, cfrp, when, the, vindeby, offshore, wind, farm, was, taken, down, in, denmark, in, 2017, 99, of, the, not, degradable, fiberglass, from, 33, wind, turbine, blades, ended, as, cut, up, at, the, r, rup, controlled, landfill, near, aalborg, and, in, 2020, with, considerably, larger, fiberglass, quantities, even, though, it, is, the, least, environmentally, friendly, way, of, handling, waste, scrapped, wind, turbine, blades, are, set, to, become, a, huge, waste, problem, in, denmark, and, countries, denmark, to, a, greater, and, greater, extent, export, its, many, produced, wind, turbines, the, reason, why, many, wings, end, up, in, landfill, is, that, they, are, incredibly, difficult, to, separate, from, each, other, which, you, will, have, to, do, if, you, hope, to, be, able, to, recycle, the, fiberglass, says, lykke, margot, ricard, associate, professor, in, innovation, and, technological, foresight, and, education, leader, for, civil, engineering, in, product, development, and, innovation, at, the, university, of, southern, denmark, sdu, according, to, dakofa, the, danish, competence, center, for, waste, and, resources, there, is, nothing, specific, in, the, danish, waste, order, about, how, to, handle, discarded, fiberglass, several, scrap, dealers, tell, ingeni, ren, that, they, have, handled, wind, turbine, blades, wings, that, have, been, pulverized, after, being, taken, to, a, recycling, station, one, of, them, is, the, recycling, company, h, j, hansen, where, the, product, manager, informed, that, they, have, transported, approximately, half, of, the, wings, they, have, received, since, 2012, to, reno, nord, s, landfill, in, aalborg, a, total, of, around, 1, 000, wings, have, ended, up, there, he, estimates, and, today, up, to, 99, percent, of, the, wings, the, company, receives, end, up, in, a, landfill, since, 1996, according, to, an, estimate, made, by, lykke, margot, ricard, sdu, in, 2020, at, least, 8, 810, tonnes, of, the, wing, scrap, have, been, disposed, of, in, denmark, and, the, waste, problem, will, grow, significantly, in, the, coming, years, when, more, and, more, wind, turbines, have, reached, their, end, of, life, according, to, the, sdu, lecturer, s, calculations, the, waste, sector, in, denmark, will, have, to, receive, 46, 400, tonnes, of, fiberglass, from, wind, turbine, blades, over, the, next, 20, 25, years, as, so, at, the, island, lolland, in, denmark, 250, tonnes, of, fiberglass, from, wind, turbine, waste, also, pours, up, on, a, landfill, at, gerringe, in, the, middle, of, lolland, in, 2020, in, the, united, states, worn, out, wind, turbine, blades, made, of, fiberglass, go, to, the, handful, of, landfills, that, accept, them, e, g, in, lake, mills, iowa, sioux, falls, south, dakota, casper, windpumps, were, used, to, pump, water, since, at, least, the, 9th, century, in, what, is, now, afghanistan, iran, and, pakistan, the, use, of, windpumps, became, widespread, across, the, muslim, world, and, later, spread, to, east, asia, china, and, south, asia, india, windmills, were, later, used, extensively, in, europe, particularly, in, the, netherlands, and, the, east, anglia, area, of, great, britain, from, the, late, middle, ages, onwards, to, drain,
