fighter, aircraft, early, on, also, pursuit, aircraft, are, military, aircraft, designed, primarily, for, air, to, air, combat, in, military, conflict, the, role, of, fighter, aircraft, is, to, establish, air, superiority, of, the, battlespace, domination, of, the, airspace, above, a, battlefield, permits, bombers, and, attack, aircraft, to, engage, in, tactical, and, strategic, bombing, of, enemy, targets, and, helps, prevent, the, enemy, from, doing, the, same, the, key, performance, features, of, a, fighter, include, not, only, its, firepower, but, also, its, high, speed, and, maneuverability, relative, to, the, target, aircraft, the, success, or, failure, of, a, combatant, s, efforts, to, gain, air, superiority, hinges, on, several, factors, including, the, skill, of, its, pilots, the, tactical, soundness, of, its, doctrine, for, deploying, its, fighters, and, the, numbers, and, performance, of, those, fighters, many, modern, fighter, aircraft, also, have, secondary, capabilities, such, as, ground, attack, and, some, types, such, as, fighter, bombers, are, designed, from, the, outset, for, dual, roles, other, fighter, designs, are, highly, specialized, while, still, filling, the, main, air, superiority, role, and, these, include, the, interceptor, heavy, fighter, and, night, fighter, since, world, war, i, achieving, and, maintaining, air, superiority, has, been, considered, essential, for, victory, in, conventional, warfare, fighters, continued, to, be, developed, throughout, world, war, i, to, deny, enemy, aircraft, and, dirigibles, the, ability, to, gather, information, by, reconnaissance, over, the, battlefield, early, fighters, were, very, small, and, lightly, armed, by, later, standards, and, most, were, biplanes, built, with, a, wooden, frame, covered, with, fabric, and, a, maximum, airspeed, of, about, 100, mph, 160, km, h, as, control, of, the, airspace, over, armies, became, increasingly, important, all, of, the, major, powers, developed, fighters, to, support, their, military, operations, between, the, wars, wood, was, largely, replaced, in, part, or, whole, by, metal, tubing, and, finally, aluminum, stressed, skin, structures, monocoque, began, to, predominate, by, world, war, ii, most, fighters, were, all, metal, monoplanes, armed, with, batteries, of, machine, guns, or, cannons, and, some, were, capable, of, speeds, approaching, 400, mph, 640, km, h, most, fighters, up, to, this, point, had, one, engine, but, a, number, of, twin, engine, fighters, were, built, however, they, were, found, to, be, outmatched, against, single, engine, fighters, and, were, relegated, to, other, tasks, such, as, night, fighters, equipped, with, radar, sets, by, the, end, of, the, war, turbojet, engines, were, replacing, piston, engines, as, the, means, of, propulsion, further, increasing, aircraft, speed, since, the, weight, of, the, turbojet, engine, was, far, less, than, a, piston, engine, having, two, engines, was, no, longer, a, handicap, and, one, or, two, were, used, depending, on, requirements, this, in, turn, required, the, development, of, ejection, seats, so, the, pilot, could, escape, and, g, suits, to, counter, the, much, greater, forces, being, applied, to, the, pilot, during, maneuvers, in, the, 1950s, radar, was, fitted, to, day, fighters, since, due, to, ever, increasing, air, to, air, weapon, ranges, pilots, could, no, longer, see, far, enough, ahead, to, prepare, for, the, opposition, subsequently, radar, capabilities, grew, enormously, and, are, now, the, primary, method, of, target, acquisition, wings, were, made, thinner, and, swept, back, to, reduce, transonic, drag, which, required, new, manufacturing, methods, to, obtain, sufficient, strength, skins, were, no, longer, sheet, metal, riveted, to, a, structure, but, milled, from, large, slabs, of, alloy, the, sound, barrier, was, broken, and, after, a, few, false, starts, due, to, required, changes, in, controls, speeds, quickly, reached, mach, 2, past, which, aircraft, cannot, maneuver, sufficiently, to, avoid, attack, air, to, air, missiles, largely, replaced, guns, and, rockets, in, the, early, 1960s, since, both, were, believed, unusable, at, the, speeds, being, attained, however, the, vietnam, war, showed, that, guns, still, had, a, role, to, play, and, most, fighters, built, since, then, are, fitted, with, cannon, typically, between, 20, and, 30, mm, 0, 79, and, 1, 18, in, in, caliber, in, addition, to, missiles, most, modern, combat, aircraft, can, carry, at, least, a, pair, of, air, to, air, missiles, in, the, 1970s, turbofans, replaced, turbojets, improving, fuel, economy, enough, that, the, last, piston, engine, support, aircraft, could, be, replaced, with, jets, making, multi, role, combat, aircraft, possible, honeycomb, structures, began, to, replace, milled, structures, and, the, first, composite, components, began, to, appear, on, components, subjected, to, little, stress, with, the, steady, improvements, in, computers, defensive, systems, have, become, increasingly, efficient, to, counter, this, stealth, technologies, have, been, pursued, by, the, united, states, russia, india, and, china, the, first, step, was, to, find, ways, to, reduce, the, aircraft, s, reflectivity, to, radar, waves, by, burying, the, engines, eliminating, sharp, corners, and, diverting, any, reflections, away, from, the, radar, sets, of, opposing, forces, various, materials, were, found, to, absorb, the, energy, from, radar, waves, and, were, incorporated, into, special, finishes, that, have, since, found, widespread, application, composite, structures, have, become, widespread, including, major, structural, components, and, have, helped, to, counterbalance, the, steady, increases, in, aircraft, weight, most, modern, fighters, are, larger, and, heavier, than, world, war, ii, medium, bombers, because, of, the, importance, of, air, superiority, since, the, early, days, of, aerial, combat, armed, forces, have, constantly, competed, to, develop, technologically, superior, fighters, and, to, deploy, these, fighters, in, greater, numbers, and, fielding, a, viable, fighter, fleet, consumes, a, substantial, proportion, of, the, defense, budgets, of, modern, armed, forces, the, global, combat, aircraft, market, was, worth, 45, 75, billion, in, 2017, and, is, projected, by, frost, sullivan, at, 47, 2, billion, in, 2026, 35, modernization, programs, and, 65, aircraft, purchases, dominated, by, the, lockheed, martin, f, 35, with, 3, 000, deliveries, over, 20, years, a, fighter, aircraft, is, primarily, designed, for, air, to, air, combat, a, given, type, may, be, designed, for, specific, combat, conditions, and, in, some, cases, for, additional, roles, such, as, air, to, ground, fighting, historically, the, british, royal, flying, corps, and, royal, air, force, referred, to, them, as, scouts, until, the, early, 1920s, while, the, u, s, army, called, them, pursuit, aircraft, until, the, late, 1940s, using, the, designation, p, as, in, curtiss, p, 40, warhawk, republic, p, 47, thunderbolt, and, bell, p, 63, kingcobra, the, uk, changed, to, calling, them, fighters, in, the, 1920s, while, the, us, army, did, so, in, the, 1940s, a, short, range, fighter, designed, to, defend, against, incoming, enemy, aircraft, is, known, as, an, interceptor, recognized, classes, of, fighter, include, of, these, the, fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, fighter, and, strike, fighter, classes, are, dual, role, possessing, qualities, of, the, fighter, alongside, some, other, battlefield, role, some, fighter, designs, may, be, developed, in, variants, performing, other, roles, entirely, such, as, ground, attack, or, unarmed, reconnaissance, this, may, be, for, political, or, national, security, reasons, for, advertising, purposes, or, other, reasons, the, sopwith, camel, and, other, fighting, scouts, of, world, war, i, performed, a, great, deal, of, ground, attack, work, in, world, war, ii, the, usaaf, and, raf, often, favored, fighters, over, dedicated, light, bombers, or, dive, bombers, and, types, such, as, the, republic, p, 47, thunderbolt, and, hawker, hurricane, that, were, no, longer, competitive, as, aerial, combat, fighters, were, relegated, to, ground, attack, several, aircraft, such, as, the, f, 111, and, f, 117, have, received, fighter, designations, though, they, had, no, fighter, capability, due, to, political, or, other, reasons, the, f, 111b, variant, was, originally, intended, for, a, fighter, role, with, the, u, s, navy, but, it, was, canceled, this, blurring, follows, the, use, of, fighters, from, their, earliest, days, for, attack, or, strike, operations, against, ground, targets, by, means, of, strafing, or, dropping, small, bombs, and, incendiaries, versatile, multi, role, fighter, bombers, such, as, the, mcdonnell, douglas, f, a, 18, hornet, are, a, less, expensive, option, than, having, a, range, of, specialized, aircraft, types, some, of, the, most, expensive, fighters, such, as, the, us, grumman, f, 14, tomcat, mcdonnell, douglas, f, 15, eagle, lockheed, martin, f, 22, raptor, and, russian, sukhoi, su, 27, were, employed, as, all, weather, interceptors, as, well, as, air, superiority, fighter, aircraft, while, commonly, developing, air, to, ground, roles, late, in, their, careers, an, interceptor, is, generally, an, aircraft, intended, to, target, or, intercept, bombers, and, so, often, trades, maneuverability, for, climb, rate, as, a, part, of, military, nomenclature, a, letter, is, often, assigned, to, various, types, of, aircraft, to, indicate, their, use, along, with, a, number, to, indicate, the, specific, aircraft, the, letters, used, to, designate, a, fighter, differ, in, various, countries, in, the, english, speaking, world, f, is, often, now, used, to, indicate, a, fighter, e, g, lockheed, martin, f, 35, lightning, ii, or, supermarine, spitfire, f, 22, though, p, used, to, be, used, in, the, us, for, pursuit, e, g, curtiss, p, 40, warhawk, a, translation, of, the, french, c, dewoitine, d, 520, c, 1, for, chasseur, while, in, russia, i, was, used, for, istrebitel, or, exterminator, polikarpov, i, 16, as, fighter, types, have, proliferated, the, air, superiority, fighter, emerged, as, a, specific, role, at, the, pinnacle, of, speed, maneuverability, and, air, to, air, weapon, systems, able, to, hold, its, own, against, all, other, fighters, and, establish, its, dominance, in, the, skies, above, the, battlefield, the, interceptor, is, a, fighter, designed, specifically, to, intercept, and, engage, approaching, enemy, aircraft, there, are, two, general, classes, of, interceptor, relatively, lightweight, aircraft, in, the, point, defence, role, built, for, fast, reaction, high, performance, and, with, a, short, range, and, heavier, aircraft, with, more, comprehensive, avionics, and, designed, to, fly, at, night, or, in, all, weathers, and, to, operate, over, longer, ranges, originating, during, world, war, i, by, 1929, this, class, of, fighters, had, become, known, as, the, interceptor, the, equipment, necessary, for, daytime, flight, is, inadequate, when, flying, at, night, or, in, poor, visibility, the, night, fighter, was, developed, during, world, war, i, with, additional, equipment, to, aid, the, pilot, in, flying, straight, navigating, and, finding, the, target, from, modified, variants, of, the, royal, aircraft, factory, b, e, 2c, in, 1915, the, night, fighter, has, evolved, into, the, highly, capable, all, weather, fighter, the, strategic, fighter, is, a, fast, heavily, armed, and, long, range, type, able, to, act, as, an, escort, fighter, protecting, bombers, to, carry, out, offensive, sorties, of, its, own, as, a, penetration, fighter, and, maintain, standing, patrols, at, significant, distance, from, its, home, base, bombers, are, vulnerable, due, to, their, low, speed, large, size, and, poor, maneuvrability, the, escort, fighter, was, developed, during, world, war, ii, to, come, between, the, bombers, and, enemy, attackers, as, a, protective, shield, the, primary, requirement, was, for, long, range, with, several, heavy, fighters, given, the, role, however, they, too, proved, unwieldy, and, vulnerable, so, as, the, war, progressed, techniques, such, as, drop, tanks, were, developed, to, extend, the, range, of, more, nimble, conventional, fighters, the, penetration, fighter, is, typically, also, fitted, for, the, ground, attack, role, and, so, is, able, to, defend, itself, while, conducting, attack, sorties, the, word, fighter, was, first, used, to, describe, a, two, seat, aircraft, carrying, a, machine, gun, mounted, on, a, pedestal, and, its, operator, as, well, as, the, pilot, although, the, term, was, coined, in, the, united, kingdom, the, first, examples, were, the, french, voisin, pushers, beginning, in, 1910, and, a, voisin, iii, would, be, the, first, to, shoot, down, another, aircraft, on, 5, october, 1914, however, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, front, line, aircraft, were, mostly, unarmed, and, used, almost, exclusively, for, reconnaissance, on, 15, august, 1914, miodrag, tomi, encountered, an, enemy, airplane, while, on, a, reconnaissance, flight, over, austria, hungary, which, fired, at, his, aircraft, with, a, revolver, so, tomi, fired, back, it, was, believed, to, be, the, first, exchange, of, fire, between, aircraft, within, weeks, all, serbian, and, austro, hungarian, aircraft, were, armed, another, type, of, military, aircraft, formed, the, basis, for, an, effective, fighter, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, it, was, based, on, small, fast, aircraft, developed, before, the, war, for, air, racing, such, with, the, gordon, bennett, cup, and, schneider, trophy, the, military, scout, airplane, was, not, expected, to, carry, serious, armament, but, rather, to, rely, on, speed, to, scout, a, location, and, return, quickly, to, report, making, it, a, flying, horse, british, scout, aircraft, in, this, sense, included, the, sopwith, tabloid, and, bristol, scout, the, french, and, the, germans, didn, t, have, an, equivalent, as, they, used, two, seaters, for, reconnaissance, such, as, the, morane, saulnier, l, but, would, later, modify, pre, war, racing, aircraft, into, armed, single, seaters, it, was, quickly, found, that, these, were, of, little, use, since, the, pilot, couldn, t, record, what, he, saw, while, also, flying, while, military, leaders, usually, ignored, what, the, pilots, reported, attempts, were, made, with, handheld, weapons, such, as, pistols, and, rifles, and, even, light, machine, guns, but, these, were, ineffective, and, cumbersome, the, next, advance, came, with, the, fixed, forward, firing, machine, gun, so, that, the, pilot, pointed, the, entire, aircraft, at, the, target, and, fired, the, gun, instead, of, relying, on, a, second, gunner, roland, garros, bolted, metal, deflector, plates, to, the, propeller, so, that, it, would, not, shoot, itself, out, of, the, sky, and, a, number, of, morane, saulnier, ns, were, modified, the, technique, proved, effective, however, the, deflected, bullets, were, still, highly, dangerous, soon, after, the, commencement, of, the, war, pilots, armed, themselves, with, pistols, carbines, grenades, and, an, assortment, of, improvised, weapons, many, of, these, proved, ineffective, as, the, pilot, had, to, fly, his, airplane, while, attempting, to, aim, a, handheld, weapon, and, make, a, difficult, deflection, shot, the, first, step, in, finding, a, real, solution, was, to, mount, the, weapon, on, the, aircraft, but, the, propeller, remained, a, problem, since, the, best, direction, to, shoot, is, straight, ahead, numerous, solutions, were, tried, a, second, crew, member, behind, the, pilot, could, aim, and, fire, a, swivel, mounted, machine, gun, at, enemy, airplanes, however, this, limited, the, area, of, coverage, chiefly, to, the, rear, hemisphere, and, effective, coordination, of, the, pilot, s, maneuvering, with, the, gunner, s, aiming, was, difficult, this, option, was, chiefly, employed, as, a, defensive, measure, on, two, seater, reconnaissance, aircraft, from, 1915, on, both, the, spad, s, a, and, the, royal, aircraft, factory, b, e, 9, added, a, second, crewman, ahead, of, the, engine, in, a, pod, but, this, was, both, hazardous, to, the, second, crewman, and, limited, performance, the, sopwith, l, r, t, tr, similarly, added, a, pod, on, the, top, wing, with, no, better, luck, an, alternative, was, to, build, a, pusher, scout, such, as, the, airco, dh, 2, with, the, propeller, mounted, behind, the, pilot, the, main, drawback, was, that, the, high, drag, of, a, pusher, type, s, tail, structure, made, it, slower, than, a, similar, tractor, aircraft, a, better, solution, for, a, single, seat, scout, was, to, mount, the, machine, gun, rifles, and, pistols, having, been, dispensed, with, to, fire, forwards, but, outside, the, propeller, arc, wing, guns, were, tried, but, the, unreliable, weapons, available, required, frequent, clearing, of, jammed, rounds, and, misfires, and, remained, impractical, until, after, the, war, mounting, the, machine, gun, over, the, top, wing, worked, well, and, was, used, long, after, the, ideal, solution, was, found, the, nieuport, 11, of, 1916, used, this, system, with, considerable, success, however, this, placement, made, aiming, and, reloading, difficult, but, would, continue, to, be, used, throughout, the, war, as, the, weapons, used, were, lighter, and, had, a, higher, rate, of, fire, than, synchronized, weapons, the, british, foster, mounting, and, several, french, mountings, were, specifically, designed, for, this, kind, of, application, fitted, with, either, the, hotchkiss, or, lewis, machine, gun, which, due, to, their, design, were, unsuitable, for, synchronizing, the, need, to, arm, a, tractor, scout, with, a, forward, firing, gun, whose, bullets, passed, through, the, propeller, arc, was, evident, even, before, the, outbreak, of, war, and, inventors, in, both, france, and, germany, devised, mechanisms, that, could, time, the, firing, of, the, individual, rounds, to, avoid, hitting, the, propeller, blades, franz, schneider, a, swiss, engineer, had, patented, such, a, device, in, germany, in, 1913, but, his, original, work, was, not, followed, up, french, aircraft, designer, raymond, saulnier, patented, a, practical, device, in, april, 1914, but, trials, were, unsuccessful, because, of, the, propensity, of, the, machine, gun, employed, to, hang, fire, due, to, unreliable, ammunition, in, december, 1914, french, aviator, roland, garros, asked, saulnier, to, install, his, synchronization, gear, on, garros, morane, saulnier, type, l, parasol, monoplane, unfortunately, the, gas, operated, hotchkiss, machine, gun, he, was, provided, had, an, erratic, rate, of, fire, and, it, was, impossible, to, synchronize, it, with, the, propeller, as, an, interim, measure, the, propeller, blades, were, fitted, with, metal, wedges, to, protect, them, from, ricochets, garros, modified, monoplane, first, flew, in, march, 1915, and, he, began, combat, operations, soon, after, garros, scored, three, victories, in, three, weeks, before, he, himself, was, downed, on, 18, april, and, his, airplane, along, with, its, synchronization, gear, and, propeller, was, captured, by, the, germans, meanwhile, the, synchronization, gear, called, the, stangensteuerung, in, german, for, pushrod, control, system, devised, by, the, engineers, of, anthony, fokker, s, firm, was, the, first, system, to, enter, service, it, would, usher, in, what, the, british, called, the, fokker, scourge, and, a, period, of, air, superiority, for, the, german, forces, making, the, fokker, eindecker, monoplane, a, feared, name, over, the, western, front, despite, its, being, an, adaptation, of, an, obsolete, pre, war, french, morane, saulnier, racing, airplane, with, poor, flight, characteristics, and, a, by, now, mediocre, performance, the, first, eindecker, victory, came, on, 1, july, 1915, when, leutnant, kurt, wintgens, of, feldflieger, abteilung, 6, on, the, western, front, downed, a, morane, saulnier, type, l, his, was, one, of, five, fokker, m, 5, k, mg, prototypes, for, the, eindecker, and, was, armed, with, a, synchronized, aviation, version, of, the, parabellum, mg14, machine, gun, the, success, of, the, eindecker, kicked, off, a, competitive, cycle, of, improvement, among, the, combatants, both, sides, striving, to, build, ever, more, capable, single, seat, fighters, the, albatros, d, i, and, sopwith, pup, of, 1916, set, the, classic, pattern, followed, by, fighters, for, about, twenty, years, most, were, biplanes, and, only, rarely, monoplanes, or, triplanes, the, strong, box, structure, of, the, biplane, provided, a, rigid, wing, that, allowed, the, accurate, control, essential, for, dogfighting, they, had, a, single, operator, who, flew, the, aircraft, and, also, controlled, its, armament, they, were, armed, with, one, or, two, maxim, or, vickers, machine, guns, which, were, easier, to, synchronize, than, other, types, firing, through, the, propeller, arc, gun, breeches, were, in, front, of, the, pilot, with, obvious, implications, in, case, of, accidents, but, jams, could, be, cleared, in, flight, while, aiming, was, simplified, the, use, of, metal, aircraft, structures, was, pioneered, before, world, war, i, by, breguet, but, would, find, its, biggest, proponent, in, anthony, fokker, who, used, chrome, molybdenum, steel, tubing, for, the, fuselage, structure, of, all, his, fighter, designs, while, the, innovative, german, engineer, hugo, junkers, developed, two, all, metal, single, seat, fighter, monoplane, designs, with, cantilever, wings, the, strictly, experimental, junkers, j, 2, private, venture, aircraft, made, with, steel, and, some, forty, examples, of, the, junkers, d, i, made, with, corrugated, duralumin, all, based, on, his, experience, in, creating, the, pioneering, junkers, j, 1, all, metal, airframe, technology, demonstration, aircraft, of, late, 1915, while, fokker, would, pursue, steel, tube, fuselages, with, wooden, wings, until, the, late, 1930s, and, junkers, would, focus, on, corrugated, sheet, metal, dornier, was, the, first, to, build, a, fighter, the, dornier, zeppelin, d, i, made, with, pre, stressed, sheet, aluminum, and, having, cantilevered, wings, a, form, that, would, replace, all, others, in, the, 1930s, as, collective, combat, experience, grew, the, more, successful, pilots, such, as, oswald, boelcke, max, immelmann, and, edward, mannock, developed, innovative, tactical, formations, and, maneuvers, to, enhance, their, air, units, combat, effectiveness, allied, and, before, 1918, german, pilots, of, world, war, i, were, not, equipped, with, parachutes, so, in, flight, fires, or, structural, failures, were, often, fatal, parachutes, were, well, developed, by, 1918, having, previously, been, used, by, balloonists, and, were, adopted, by, the, german, flying, services, during, the, course, of, that, year, the, well, known, and, feared, manfred, von, richthofen, the, red, baron, was, wearing, one, when, he, was, killed, but, the, allied, command, continued, to, oppose, their, use, on, various, grounds, in, april, 1917, during, a, brief, period, of, german, aerial, supremacy, a, british, pilot, s, average, life, expectancy, was, calculated, to, average, 93, flying, hours, or, about, three, weeks, of, active, service, more, than, 50, 000, airmen, from, both, sides, died, during, the, war, fighter, development, stagnated, between, the, wars, especially, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, where, budgets, were, small, in, france, italy, and, russia, where, large, budgets, continued, to, allow, major, development, both, monoplanes, and, all, metal, structures, were, common, by, the, end, of, the, 1920s, however, those, countries, overspent, themselves, and, were, overtaken, in, the, 1930s, by, those, powers, that, hadn, t, been, spending, heavily, namely, the, british, the, americans, the, spanish, in, the, spanish, civil, war, and, the, germans, given, limited, budgets, air, forces, were, conservative, in, aircraft, design, and, biplanes, remained, popular, with, pilots, for, their, agility, and, remained, in, service, long, after, they, ceased, to, be, competitive, designs, such, as, the, gloster, gladiator, fiat, cr, 42, falco, and, polikarpov, i, 15, were, common, even, in, the, late, 1930s, and, many, were, still, in, service, as, late, as, 1942, up, until, the, mid, 1930s, the, majority, of, fighters, in, the, us, the, uk, italy, and, russia, remained, fabric, covered, biplanes, fighter, armament, eventually, began, to, be, mounted, inside, the, wings, outside, the, arc, of, the, propeller, though, most, designs, retained, two, synchronized, machine, guns, directly, ahead, of, the, pilot, where, they, were, more, accurate, that, being, the, strongest, part, of, the, structure, reducing, the, vibration, to, which, the, guns, were, subjected, shooting, with, this, traditional, arrangement, was, also, easier, because, the, guns, shot, directly, ahead, in, the, direction, of, the, aircraft, s, flight, up, to, the, limit, of, the, guns, range, unlike, wing, mounted, guns, which, to, be, effective, required, to, be, harmonised, that, is, preset, to, shoot, at, an, angle, by, ground, crews, so, that, their, bullets, would, converge, on, a, target, area, a, set, distance, ahead, of, the, fighter, rifle, caliber, 30, and, 303, in, 7, 62, and, 7, 70, mm, calibre, guns, remained, the, norm, with, larger, weapons, either, being, too, heavy, and, cumbersome, or, deemed, unnecessary, against, such, lightly, built, aircraft, it, was, not, considered, unreasonable, to, use, world, war, i, style, armament, to, counter, enemy, fighters, as, there, was, insufficient, air, to, air, combat, during, most, of, the, period, to, disprove, this, notion, the, rotary, engine, popular, during, world, war, i, quickly, disappeared, its, development, having, reached, the, point, where, rotational, forces, prevented, more, fuel, and, air, from, being, delivered, to, the, cylinders, which, limited, horsepower, they, were, replaced, chiefly, by, the, stationary, radial, engine, though, major, advances, led, to, inline, engines, gaining, ground, with, several, exceptional, engines, including, the, 1, 145, cu, in, 18, 760, cm, 3, v, 12, curtiss, d, 12, aircraft, engines, increased, in, power, several, fold, over, the, period, going, from, a, typical, 180, hp, 130, kw, in, the, 900, kg, 2, 000, lb, fokker, d, vii, of, 1918, to, 900, hp, 670, kw, in, the, 2, 500, kg, 5, 500, lb, curtiss, p, 36, of, 1936, the, debate, between, the, sleek, in, line, engines, versus, the, more, reliable, radial, models, continued, with, naval, air, forces, preferring, the, radial, engines, and, land, based, forces, often, choosing, inlines, radial, designs, did, not, require, a, separate, and, vulnerable, radiator, but, had, increased, drag, inline, engines, often, had, a, better, power, to, weight, ratio, some, air, forces, experimented, with, heavy, fighters, called, destroyers, by, the, germans, these, were, larger, usually, twin, engined, aircraft, sometimes, adaptations, of, light, or, medium, bomber, types, such, designs, typically, had, greater, internal, fuel, capacity, thus, longer, range, and, heavier, armament, than, their, single, engine, counterparts, in, combat, they, proved, vulnerable, to, more, agile, single, engine, fighters, the, primary, driver, of, fighter, innovation, right, up, to, the, period, of, rapid, re, armament, in, the, late, 1930s, were, not, military, budgets, but, civilian, aircraft, racing, aircraft, designed, for, these, races, introduced, innovations, like, streamlining, and, more, powerful, engines, that, would, find, their, way, into, the, fighters, of, world, war, ii, the, most, significant, of, these, was, the, schneider, trophy, races, where, competition, grew, so, fierce, only, national, governments, could, afford, to, enter, at, the, very, end, of, the, inter, war, period, in, europe, came, the, spanish, civil, war, this, was, just, the, opportunity, the, german, luftwaffe, italian, regia, aeronautica, and, the, soviet, union, s, voenno, vozdushnye, sily, needed, to, test, their, latest, aircraft, each, party, sent, numerous, aircraft, types, to, support, their, sides, in, the, conflict, in, the, dogfights, over, spain, the, latest, messerschmitt, bf, 109, fighters, did, well, as, did, the, soviet, polikarpov, i, 16, the, later, german, design, was, earlier, in, its, design, cycle, and, had, more, room, for, development, and, the, lessons, learned, led, to, greatly, improved, models, in, world, war, ii, the, russians, failed, to, keep, up, and, despite, newer, models, coming, into, service, i, 16s, remaining, the, most, common, soviet, front, line, fighter, into, 1942, despite, being, outclassed, by, the, improved, bf, 109s, in, world, war, ii, for, their, part, the, italians, developed, several, monoplanes, such, as, the, fiat, g, 50, freccia, but, being, short, on, funds, were, forced, to, continue, operating, obsolete, fiat, cr, 42, falco, biplanes, from, the, early, 1930s, the, japanese, were, at, war, against, both, the, chinese, nationalists, and, the, russians, in, china, and, used, the, experience, to, improve, both, training, and, aircraft, replacing, biplanes, with, modern, cantilever, monoplanes, and, creating, a, cadre, of, exceptional, pilots, in, the, united, kingdom, at, the, behest, of, neville, chamberlain, more, famous, for, his, peace, in, our, time, speech, the, entire, british, aviation, industry, was, retooled, allowing, it, to, change, quickly, from, fabric, covered, metal, framed, biplanes, to, cantilever, stressed, skin, monoplanes, in, time, for, the, war, with, germany, a, process, that, france, attempted, to, emulate, but, too, late, to, counter, the, german, invasion, the, period, of, improving, the, same, biplane, design, over, and, over, was, now, coming, to, an, end, and, the, hawker, hurricane, and, supermarine, spitfire, started, to, supplant, the, gloster, gladiator, and, hawker, fury, biplanes, but, many, biplanes, remained, in, front, line, service, well, past, the, start, of, world, war, ii, while, not, a, combatant, in, spain, they, too, absorbed, many, of, the, lessons, in, time, to, use, them, the, spanish, civil, war, also, provided, an, opportunity, for, updating, fighter, tactics, one, of, the, innovations, was, the, development, of, the, finger, four, formation, by, the, german, pilot, werner, m, lders, each, fighter, squadron, german, staffel, was, divided, into, several, flights, schw, rme, of, four, aircraft, each, schwarm, was, divided, into, two, rotten, which, was, a, pair, of, aircraft, each, rotte, was, composed, of, a, leader, and, a, wingman, this, flexible, formation, allowed, the, pilots, to, maintain, greater, situational, awareness, and, the, two, rotten, could, split, up, at, any, time, and, attack, on, their, own, the, finger, four, would, be, widely, adopted, as, the, fundamental, tactical, formation, during, world, war, two, including, by, the, british, and, later, the, americans, world, war, ii, featured, fighter, combat, on, a, larger, scale, than, any, other, conflict, to, date, german, field, marshal, erwin, rommel, noted, the, effect, of, airpower, anyone, who, has, to, fight, even, with, the, most, modern, weapons, against, an, enemy, in, complete, command, of, the, air, fights, like, a, savage, throughout, the, war, fighters, performed, their, conventional, role, in, establishing, air, superiority, through, combat, with, other, fighters, and, through, bomber, interception, and, also, often, performed, roles, such, as, tactical, air, support, and, reconnaissance, fighter, design, varied, widely, among, combatants, the, japanese, and, italians, favored, lightly, armed, and, armored, but, highly, maneuverable, designs, such, as, the, japanese, nakajima, ki, 27, nakajima, ki, 43, and, mitsubishi, a6m, zero, and, the, italian, fiat, g, 50, freccia, and, macchi, mc, 200, in, contrast, designers, in, the, united, kingdom, germany, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, believed, that, the, increased, speed, of, fighter, aircraft, would, create, g, forces, unbearable, to, pilots, who, attempted, maneuvering, dogfights, typical, of, the, first, world, war, and, their, fighters, were, instead, optimized, for, speed, and, firepower, in, practice, while, light, highly, maneuverable, aircraft, did, possess, some, advantages, in, fighter, versus, fighter, combat, those, could, usually, be, overcome, by, sound, tactical, doctrine, and, the, design, approach, of, the, italians, and, japanese, made, their, fighters, ill, suited, as, interceptors, or, attack, aircraft, during, the, invasion, of, poland, and, the, battle, of, france, luftwaffe, fighters, primarily, the, messerschmitt, bf, 109, held, air, superiority, and, the, luftwaffe, played, a, major, role, in, german, victories, in, these, campaigns, during, the, battle, of, britain, however, british, hurricanes, and, spitfires, proved, roughly, equal, to, luftwaffe, fighters, additionally, britain, s, radar, based, dowding, system, directing, fighters, onto, german, attacks, and, the, advantages, of, fighting, above, britain, s, home, territory, allowed, the, raf, to, deny, germany, air, superiority, saving, the, uk, from, possible, german, invasion, and, dealing, the, axis, a, major, defeat, early, in, the, second, world, war, on, the, eastern, front, soviet, fighter, forces, were, overwhelmed, during, the, opening, phases, of, operation, barbarossa, this, was, a, result, of, the, tactical, surprise, at, the, outset, of, the, campaign, the, leadership, vacuum, within, the, soviet, military, left, by, the, great, purge, and, the, general, inferiority, of, soviet, designs, at, the, time, such, as, the, obsolescent, polikarpov, i, 15, biplane, and, the, i, 16, more, modern, soviet, designs, including, the, mikoyan, gurevich, mig, 3, lagg, 3, and, yakolev, yak, 1, had, not, yet, arrived, in, numbers, and, in, any, case, were, still, inferior, to, the, messerschmitt, bf, 109, as, a, result, during, the, early, months, of, these, campaigns, axis, air, forces, destroyed, large, numbers, of, red, air, force, aircraft, on, the, ground, and, in, one, sided, dogfights, in, the, later, stages, on, the, eastern, front, soviet, training, and, leadership, improved, as, did, their, equipment, by, 1942, soviet, designs, such, as, the, yakovlev, yak, 9, and, lavochkin, la, 5, had, performance, comparable, to, the, german, bf, 109, and, focke, wulf, fw, 190, also, significant, numbers, of, british, and, later, u, s, fighter, aircraft, were, supplied, to, aid, the, soviet, war, effort, as, part, of, lend, lease, with, the, bell, p, 39, airacobra, proving, particularly, effective, in, the, lower, altitude, combat, typical, of, the, eastern, front, the, soviets, were, also, helped, indirectly, by, the, american, and, british, bombing, campaigns, which, forced, the, luftwaffe, to, shift, many, of, its, fighters, away, from, the, eastern, front, in, defense, against, these, raids, the, soviets, increasingly, were, able, to, challenge, the, luftwaffe, and, while, the, luftwaffe, maintained, a, qualitative, edge, over, the, red, air, force, for, much, of, the, war, the, increasing, numbers, and, efficacy, of, the, soviet, air, force, were, critical, to, the, red, army, s, efforts, at, turning, back, and, eventually, annihilating, the, wehrmacht, meanwhile, air, combat, on, the, western, front, had, a, much, different, character, much, of, this, combat, focused, on, the, strategic, bombing, campaigns, of, the, raf, and, the, usaaf, against, german, industry, intended, to, wear, down, the, luftwaffe, axis, fighter, aircraft, focused, on, defending, against, allied, bombers, while, allied, fighters, main, role, was, as, bomber, escorts, the, raf, raided, german, cities, at, night, and, both, sides, developed, radar, equipped, night, fighters, for, these, battles, the, americans, in, contrast, flew, daylight, bombing, raids, into, germany, delivering, the, combined, bomber, offensive, unescorted, consolidated, b, 24, liberators, and, boeing, b, 17, flying, fortress, bombers, however, proved, unable, to, fend, off, german, interceptors, primarily, bf, 109s, and, fw, 190s, with, the, later, arrival, of, long, range, fighters, particularly, the, north, american, p, 51, mustang, american, fighters, were, able, to, escort, far, into, germany, on, daylight, raids, and, by, ranging, ahead, attrited, the, luftwaffe, to, establish, control, of, the, skies, over, western, europe, by, the, time, of, operation, overlord, in, june, 1944, the, allies, had, gained, near, complete, air, superiority, over, the, western, front, this, cleared, the, way, both, for, intensified, strategic, bombing, of, german, cities, and, industries, and, for, the, tactical, bombing, of, battlefield, targets, with, the, luftwaffe, largely, cleared, from, the, skies, allied, fighters, increasingly, served, as, ground, attack, aircraft, allied, fighters, by, gaining, air, superiority, over, the, european, battlefield, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, eventual, defeat, of, the, axis, which, reichmarshal, hermann, g, ring, commander, of, the, german, luftwaffe, summed, up, when, he, said, when, i, saw, mustangs, over, berlin, i, knew, the, jig, was, up, major, air, combat, during, the, war, in, the, pacific, began, with, the, entry, of, the, western, allies, following, japan, s, attack, against, pearl, harbor, the, imperial, japanese, navy, air, service, primarily, operated, the, mitsubishi, a6m, zero, and, the, imperial, japanese, army, air, service, flew, the, nakajima, ki, 27, and, the, nakajima, ki, 43, initially, enjoying, great, success, as, these, fighters, generally, had, better, range, maneuverability, speed, and, climb, rates, than, their, allied, counterparts, additionally, japanese, pilots, were, well, trained, and, many, were, combat, veterans, from, japan, s, campaigns, in, china, they, quickly, gained, air, superiority, over, the, allies, who, at, this, stage, of, the, war, were, often, disorganized, under, trained, and, poorly, equipped, and, japanese, air, power, contributed, significantly, to, their, successes, in, the, philippines, malaysia, and, singapore, the, dutch, east, indies, and, burma, by, mid, 1942, the, allies, began, to, regroup, and, while, some, allied, aircraft, such, as, the, brewster, buffalo, and, the, p, 39, airacobra, were, hopelessly, outclassed, by, fighters, like, japan, s, mitsubishi, a6m, zero, others, such, as, the, army, s, curtiss, p, 40, warhawk, and, the, navy, s, grumman, f4f, wildcat, possessed, attributes, such, as, superior, firepower, ruggedness, and, dive, speed, and, the, allies, soon, developed, tactics, such, as, the, thach, weave, to, take, advantage, of, these, strengths, these, changes, soon, paid, dividends, as, the, allied, ability, to, deny, japan, air, superiority, was, critical, to, their, victories, at, coral, sea, midway, guadalcanal, and, new, guinea, in, china, the, flying, tigers, also, used, the, same, tactics, with, some, success, although, they, were, unable, to, stem, the, tide, of, japanese, advances, there, by, 1943, the, allies, began, to, gain, the, upper, hand, in, the, pacific, campaign, s, air, campaigns, several, factors, contributed, to, this, shift, first, the, lockheed, p, 38, lightning, and, second, generation, allied, fighters, such, as, the, grumman, f6, hellcat, and, later, the, vought, f4, corsair, the, republic, p, 47, thunderbolt, and, the, north, american, p, 51, mustang, began, arriving, in, numbers, these, fighters, outperformed, japanese, fighters, in, all, respects, except, maneuverability, other, problems, with, japan, s, fighter, aircraft, also, became, apparent, as, the, war, progressed, such, as, their, lack, of, armor, and, light, armament, which, had, been, typical, of, all, pre, war, fighters, worldwide, but, the, problem, was, particularly, difficult, to, rectify, on, the, japanese, designs, this, made, them, inadequate, as, either, bomber, interceptors, or, ground, attack, aircraft, roles, allied, fighters, were, still, able, to, fill, most, importantly, japan, s, training, program, failed, to, provide, enough, well, trained, pilots, to, replace, losses, in, contrast, the, allies, improved, both, the, quantity, and, quality, of, pilots, graduating, from, their, training, programs, by, mid, 1944, allied, fighters, had, gained, air, superiority, throughout, the, theater, which, would, not, be, contested, again, during, the, war, the, extent, of, allied, quantitative, and, qualitative, superiority, by, this, point, in, the, war, was, demonstrated, during, the, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, a, lopsided, allied, victory, in, which, japanese, fliers, were, shot, down, in, such, numbers, and, with, such, ease, that, american, fighter, pilots, likened, it, to, a, great, turkey, shoot, late, in, the, war, japan, began, to, produce, new, fighters, such, as, the, nakajima, ki, 84, and, the, kawanishi, n1k, to, replace, the, zero, but, only, in, small, numbers, and, by, then, japan, lacked, the, trained, pilots, or, sufficient, fuel, to, mount, an, effective, challenge, to, allied, attacks, during, the, closing, stages, of, the, war, japan, s, fighter, arm, could, not, seriously, challenge, raids, over, japan, by, american, boeing, b, 29, superfortresses, and, was, largely, reduced, to, kamikaze, attacks, fighter, technology, advanced, rapidly, during, the, second, world, war, piston, engines, which, powered, the, vast, majority, of, world, war, ii, fighters, grew, more, powerful, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, fighters, typically, had, engines, producing, between, 1, 000, hp, 750, kw, and, 1, 400, hp, 1, 000, kw, while, by, the, end, of, the, war, many, could, produce, over, 2, 000, hp, 1, 500, kw, for, example, the, spitfire, one, of, the, few, fighters, in, continuous, production, throughout, the, war, was, in, 1939, powered, by, a, 1, 030, hp, 770, kw, merlin, ii, while, variants, produced, in, 1945, were, equipped, with, the, 2, 035, hp, 1, 517, kw, rolls, royce, griffon, 61, nevertheless, these, fighters, could, only, achieve, modest, increases, in, top, speed, due, to, problems, of, compressibility, created, as, aircraft, and, their, propellers, approached, the, sound, barrier, and, it, was, apparent, that, propeller, driven, aircraft, were, approaching, the, limits, of, their, performance, german, jet, and, rocket, powered, fighters, entered, combat, in, 1944, too, late, to, impact, the, war, s, outcome, the, same, year, the, allies, only, operational, jet, fighter, the, gloster, meteor, also, entered, service, world, war, ii, fighters, also, increasingly, featured, monocoque, construction, which, improved, their, aerodynamic, efficiency, while, adding, structural, strength, laminar, flow, wings, which, improved, high, speed, performance, also, came, into, use, on, fighters, such, as, the, p, 51, mustang, while, the, messerschmitt, me, 262, and, the, messerschmitt, me, 163, featured, swept, wings, that, dramatically, reduced, drag, at, high, subsonic, speeds, armament, also, advanced, during, the, war, the, rifle, caliber, machine, guns, that, were, common, on, prewar, fighters, could, not, easily, down, the, more, rugged, warplanes, of, the, era, air, forces, began, to, replace, or, supplement, them, with, cannons, which, fired, explosive, shells, that, could, blast, a, hole, in, an, enemy, aircraft, rather, than, relying, on, kinetic, energy, from, a, solid, bullet, striking, a, critical, component, of, the, aircraft, such, as, a, fuel, line, or, control, cable, or, the, pilot, cannons, could, bring, down, even, heavy, bombers, with, just, a, few, hits, but, their, slower, rate, of, fire, made, it, difficult, to, hit, fast, moving, fighters, in, a, dogfight, eventually, most, fighters, mounted, cannons, sometimes, in, combination, with, machine, guns, the, british, epitomized, this, shift, their, standard, early, war, fighters, mounted, eight, 303, in, 7, 7, mm, caliber, machine, guns, but, by, mid, war, they, often, featured, a, combination, of, machine, guns, and, 20, mm, 0, 79, in, cannons, and, late, in, the, war, often, only, cannons, the, americans, in, contrast, had, problems, producing, a, cannon, design, so, instead, placed, multiple, 50, in, 12, 7, mm, heavy, machine, guns, on, their, fighters, fighters, were, also, increasingly, fitted, with, bomb, racks, and, air, to, surface, ordnance, such, as, bombs, or, rockets, beneath, their, wings, and, pressed, into, close, air, support, roles, as, fighter, bombers, although, they, carried, less, ordnance, than, light, and, medium, bombers, and, generally, had, a, shorter, range, they, were, cheaper, to, produce, and, maintain, and, their, maneuverability, made, it, easier, for, them, to, hit, moving, targets, such, as, motorized, vehicles, moreover, if, they, encountered, enemy, fighters, their, ordnance, which, reduced, lift, and, increased, drag, and, therefore, decreased, performance, could, be, jettisoned, and, they, could, engage, enemy, fighters, which, eliminated, the, need, for, fighter, escorts, that, bombers, required, heavily, armed, fighters, such, as, germany, s, focke, wulf, fw, 190, britain, s, hawker, typhoon, and, hawker, tempest, and, america, s, curtiss, p, 40, f4u, corsair, p, 47, thunderbolt, and, p, 38, lightning, all, excelled, as, fighter, bombers, and, since, the, second, world, war, ground, attack, has, become, an, important, secondary, capability, of, many, fighters, world, war, ii, also, saw, the, first, use, of, airborne, radar, on, fighters, the, primary, purpose, of, these, radars, was, to, help, night, fighters, locate, enemy, bombers, and, fighters, because, of, the, bulkiness, of, these, radar, sets, they, could, not, be, carried, on, conventional, single, engined, fighters, and, instead, were, typically, retrofitted, to, larger, heavy, fighters, or, light, bombers, such, as, germany, s, messerschmitt, bf, 110, and, junkers, ju, 88, britain, s, de, havilland, mosquito, and, bristol, beaufighter, and, america, s, douglas, a, 20, which, then, served, as, night, fighters, the, northrop, p, 61, black, widow, a, purpose, built, night, fighter, was, the, only, fighter, of, the, war, that, incorporated, radar, into, its, original, design, britain, and, america, cooperated, closely, in, the, development, of, airborne, radar, and, germany, s, radar, technology, generally, lagged, slightly, behind, anglo, american, efforts, while, other, combatants, developed, few, radar, equipped, fighters, a, concept, originated, from, german, engineer, bernhard, j, schrage, in, 1943, as, a, response, to, the, increasing, threat, posed, by, allied, heavy, bombers, particularly, at, night, the, schrage, musik, system, involved, mounting, upward, facing, cannon, turrets, typically, twin, 20mm, or, 30mm, guns, in, the, belly, of, german, night, fighters, such, as, the, messerschmitt, bf, 110, and, later, versions, of, the, junkers, ju, 88, these, guns, were, angled, upwards, to, target, the, vulnerable, underside, of, enemy, bombers, several, prototype, fighter, programs, begun, early, in, 1945, continued, on, after, the, war, and, led, to, advanced, piston, engine, fighters, that, entered, production, and, operational, service, in, 1946, a, typical, example, is, the, lavochkin, la, 9, fritz, which, was, an, evolution, of, the, successful, wartime, lavochkin, la, 7, fin, working, through, a, series, of, prototypes, the, la, 120, la, 126, and, la, 130, the, lavochkin, design, bureau, sought, to, replace, the, la, 7, s, wooden, airframe, with, a, metal, one, as, well, as, fit, a, laminar, flow, wing, to, improve, maneuver, performance, and, increased, armament, the, la, 9, entered, service, in, august, 1946, and, was, produced, until, 1948, it, also, served, as, the, basis, for, the, development, of, a, long, range, escort, fighter, the, la, 11, fang, of, which, nearly, 1200, were, produced, 1947, 51, over, the, course, of, the, korean, war, however, it, became, obvious, that, the, day, of, the, piston, engined, fighter, was, coming, to, a, close, and, that, the, future, would, lie, with, the, jet, fighter, this, period, also, witnessed, experimentation, with, jet, assisted, piston, engine, aircraft, la, 9, derivatives, included, examples, fitted, with, two, underwing, auxiliary, pulsejet, engines, the, la, 9rd, and, a, similarly, mounted, pair, of, auxiliary, ramjet, engines, the, la, 138, however, neither, of, these, entered, service, one, that, did, enter, service, with, the, u, s, navy, in, march, 1945, was, the, ryan, fr, 1, fireball, production, was, halted, with, the, war, s, end, on, vj, day, with, only, 66, having, been, delivered, and, the, type, was, withdrawn, from, service, in, 1947, the, usaaf, had, ordered, its, first, 13, mixed, turboprop, turbojet, powered, pre, production, prototypes, of, the, consolidated, vultee, xp, 81, fighter, but, this, program, was, also, canceled, by, vj, day, with, 80, of, the, engineering, work, completed, the, first, rocket, powered, aircraft, was, the, lippisch, ente, which, made, a, successful, maiden, flight, in, march, 1928, the, only, pure, rocket, aircraft, ever, mass, produced, was, the, messerschmitt, me, 163, b, komet, in, 1944, one, of, several, german, world, war, ii, projects, aimed, at, developing, high, speed, point, defense, aircraft, later, variants, of, the, me, 262, c, 1a, and, c, 2b, were, also, fitted, with, mixed, power, jet, rocket, powerplants, while, earlier, models, were, fitted, with, rocket, boosters, but, were, not, mass, produced, with, these, modifications, the, ussr, experimented, with, a, rocket, powered, interceptor, in, the, years, immediately, following, world, war, ii, the, mikoyan, gurevich, i, 270, only, two, were, built, in, the, 1950s, the, british, developed, mixed, power, jet, designs, employing, both, rocket, and, jet, engines, to, cover, the, performance, gap, that, existed, in, turbojet, designs, the, rocket, was, the, main, engine, for, delivering, the, speed, and, height, required, for, high, speed, interception, of, high, level, bombers, and, the, turbojet, gave, increased, fuel, economy, in, other, parts, of, flight, most, notably, to, ensure, the, aircraft, was, able, to, make, a, powered, landing, rather, than, risking, an, unpredictable, gliding, return, the, saunders, roe, sr, 53, was, a, successful, design, and, was, planned, for, production, when, economics, forced, the, british, to, curtail, most, aircraft, programs, in, the, late, 1950s, furthermore, rapid, advancements, in, jet, engine, technology, rendered, mixed, power, aircraft, designs, like, saunders, roe, s, sr, 53, and, the, following, sr, 177, obsolete, the, american, republic, xf, 91, thunderceptor, the, first, u, s, fighter, to, exceed, mach, 1, in, level, flight, met, a, similar, fate, for, the, same, reason, and, no, hybrid, rocket, and, jet, engine, fighter, design, has, ever, been, placed, into, service, the, only, operational, implementation, of, mixed, propulsion, was, rocket, assisted, take, off, rato, a, system, rarely, used, in, fighters, such, as, with, the, zero, length, launch, rato, based, takeoff, scheme, from, special, launch, platforms, tested, out, by, both, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, and, made, obsolete, with, advancements, in, surface, to, air, missile, technology, it, has, become, common, in, the, aviation, community, to, classify, jet, fighters, by, generations, for, historical, purposes, no, official, definitions, of, these, generations, exist, rather, they, represent, the, notion, of, stages, in, the, development, of, fighter, design, approaches, performance, capabilities, and, technological, evolution, different, authors, have, packed, jet, fighters, into, different, generations, for, example, richard, p, hallion, of, the, secretary, of, the, air, force, s, action, group, classified, the, f, 16, as, a, sixth, generation, jet, fighter, the, timeframes, associated, with, each, generation, remain, inexact, and, are, only, indicative, of, the, period, during, which, their, design, philosophies, and, technology, employment, enjoyed, a, prevailing, influence, on, fighter, design, and, development, these, timeframes, also, encompass, the, peak, period, of, service, entry, for, such, aircraft, the, first, generation, of, jet, fighters, comprised, the, initial, subsonic, jet, fighter, designs, introduced, late, in, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, and, in, the, early, post, war, period, they, differed, little, from, their, piston, engined, counterparts, in, appearance, and, many, employed, unswept, wings, guns, and, cannon, remained, the, principal, armament, the, need, to, obtain, a, decisive, advantage, in, maximum, speed, pushed, the, development, of, turbojet, powered, aircraft, forward, top, speeds, for, fighters, rose, steadily, throughout, world, war, ii, as, more, powerful, piston, engines, developed, and, they, approached, transonic, flight, speeds, where, the, efficiency, of, propellers, drops, off, making, further, speed, increases, nearly, impossible, the, first, jets, developed, during, world, war, ii, and, saw, combat, in, the, last, two, years, of, the, war, messerschmitt, developed, the, first, operational, jet, fighter, the, me, 262, a, primarily, serving, with, the, luftwaffe, s, jg, 7, the, world, s, first, jet, fighter, wing, it, was, considerably, faster, than, contemporary, piston, driven, aircraft, and, in, the, hands, of, a, competent, pilot, proved, quite, difficult, for, allied, pilots, to, defeat, the, luftwaffe, never, deployed, the, design, in, numbers, sufficient, to, stop, the, allied, air, campaign, and, a, combination, of, fuel, shortages, pilot, losses, and, technical, difficulties, with, the, engines, kept, the, number, of, sorties, low, nevertheless, the, me, 262, indicated, the, obsolescence, of, piston, driven, aircraft, spurred, by, reports, of, the, german, jets, britain, s, gloster, meteor, entered, production, soon, after, and, the, two, entered, service, around, the, same, time, in, 1944, meteors, commonly, served, to, intercept, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, as, they, were, faster, than, available, piston, engined, fighters, at, the, low, altitudes, used, by, the, flying, bombs, nearer, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, first, military, jet, powered, light, fighter, design, the, luftwaffe, intended, the, heinkel, he, 162, a, spatz, sparrow, to, serve, as, a, simple, jet, fighter, for, german, home, defense, with, a, few, examples, seeing, squadron, service, with, jg, 1, by, april, 1945, by, the, end, of, the, war, almost, all, work, on, piston, powered, fighters, had, ended, a, few, designs, combining, piston, and, jet, engines, for, propulsion, such, as, the, ryan, fr, fireball, saw, brief, use, but, by, the, end, of, the, 1940s, virtually, all, new, fighters, were, jet, powered, despite, their, advantages, the, early, jet, fighters, were, far, from, perfect, the, operational, lifespan, of, turbines, were, very, short, and, engines, were, temperamental, while, power, could, be, adjusted, only, slowly, and, acceleration, was, poor, even, if, top, speed, was, higher, compared, to, the, final, generation, of, piston, fighters, many, squadrons, of, piston, engined, fighters, remained, in, service, until, the, early, to, mid, 1950s, even, in, the, air, forces, of, the, major, powers, though, the, types, retained, were, the, best, of, the, world, war, ii, designs, innovations, including, ejection, seats, air, brakes, and, all, moving, tailplanes, became, widespread, in, this, period, the, americans, began, using, jet, fighters, operationally, after, world, war, ii, the, wartime, bell, p, 59, having, proven, a, failure, the, lockheed, p, 80, shooting, star, soon, re, designated, f, 80, was, more, prone, to, wave, drag, than, the, swept, wing, me, 262, but, had, a, cruise, speed, 660, km, h, 410, mph, as, high, as, the, maximum, speed, attainable, by, many, piston, engined, fighters, the, british, designed, several, new, jets, including, the, distinctive, single, engined, twin, boom, de, havilland, vampire, which, britain, sold, to, the, air, forces, of, many, nations, the, british, transferred, the, technology, of, the, rolls, royce, nene, jet, engine, to, the, soviets, who, soon, put, it, to, use, in, their, advanced, mikoyan, gurevich, mig, 15, fighter, which, used, fully, swept, wings, that, allowed, flying, closer, to, the, speed, of, sound, than, straight, winged, designs, such, as, the, f, 80, the, mig, 15s, top, speed, of, 1, 075, km, h, 668, mph, proved, quite, a, shock, to, the, american, f, 80, pilots, who, encountered, them, in, the, korean, war, along, with, their, armament, of, two, 23, mm, 0, 91, in, cannons, and, a, single, 37, mm, 1, 5, in, cannon, nevertheless, in, the, first, jet, versus, jet, dogfight, which, occurred, during, the, korean, war, on, 8, november, 1950, an, f, 80, shot, down, two, north, korean, mig, 15s, the, americans, responded, by, rushing, their, own, swept, wing, fighter, the, north, american, f, 86, sabre, into, battle, against, the, migs, which, had, similar, transsonic, performance, the, two, aircraft, had, different, strengths, and, weaknesses, but, were, similar, enough, that, victory, could, go, either, way, while, the, sabres, focused, primarily, on, downing, migs, and, scored, favorably, against, those, flown, by, the, poorly, trained, north, koreans, the, migs, in, turn, decimated, us, bomber, formations, and, forced, the, withdrawal, of, numerous, american, types, from, operational, service, the, world, s, navies, also, transitioned, to, jets, during, this, period, despite, the, need, for, catapult, launching, of, the, new, aircraft, the, u, s, navy, adopted, the, grumman, f9f, panther, as, their, primary, jet, fighter, in, the, korean, war, period, and, it, was, one, of, the, first, jet, fighters, to, employ, an, afterburner, the, de, havilland, sea, vampire, became, the, royal, navy, s, first, jet, fighter, radar, was, used, on, specialized, night, fighters, such, as, the, douglas, f3d, skyknight, which, also, downed, migs, over, korea, and, later, fitted, to, the, mcdonnell, f2h, banshee, and, swept, wing, vought, f7u, cutlass, and, mcdonnell, f3h, demon, as, all, weather, night, fighters, early, versions, of, infra, red, ir, air, to, air, missiles, aams, such, as, the, aim, 9, sidewinder, and, radar, guided, missiles, such, as, the, aim, 7, sparrow, whose, descendants, remain, in, use, as, of, 2021, were, first, introduced, on, swept, wing, subsonic, demon, and, cutlass, naval, fighters, technological, breakthroughs, lessons, learned, from, the, aerial, battles, of, the, korean, war, and, a, focus, on, conducting, operations, in, a, nuclear, warfare, environment, shaped, the, development, of, second, generation, fighters, technological, advances, in, aerodynamics, propulsion, and, aerospace, building, materials, primarily, aluminum, alloys, permitted, designers, to, experiment, with, aeronautical, innovations, such, as, swept, wings, delta, wings, and, area, ruled, fuselages, widespread, use, of, afterburning, turbojet, engines, made, these, the, first, production, aircraft, to, break, the, sound, barrier, and, the, ability, to, sustain, supersonic, speeds, in, level, flight, became, a, common, capability, amongst, fighters, of, this, generation, fighter, designs, also, took, advantage, of, new, electronics, technologies, that, made, effective, radars, small, enough, to, carry, aboard, smaller, aircraft, onboard, radars, permitted, detection, of, enemy, aircraft, beyond, visual, range, thereby, improving, the, handoff, of, targets, by, longer, ranged, ground, based, warning, and, tracking, radars, similarly, advances, in, guided, missile, development, allowed, air, to, air, missiles, to, begin, supplementing, the, gun, as, the, primary, offensive, weapon, for, the, first, time, in, fighter, history, during, this, period, passive, homing, infrared, guided, ir, missiles, became, commonplace, but, early, ir, missile, sensors, had, poor, sensitivity, and, a, very, narrow, field, of, view, typically, no, more, than, 30, which, limited, their, effective, use, to, only, close, range, tail, chase, engagements, radar, guided, rf, missiles, were, introduced, as, well, but, early, examples, proved, unreliable, these, semi, active, radar, homing, sarh, missiles, could, track, and, intercept, an, enemy, aircraft, painted, by, the, launching, aircraft, s, onboard, radar, medium, and, long, range, rf, air, to, air, missiles, promised, to, open, up, a, new, dimension, of, beyond, visual, range, bvr, combat, and, much, effort, concentrated, on, further, development, of, this, technology, the, prospect, of, a, potential, third, world, war, featuring, large, mechanized, armies, and, nuclear, weapon, strikes, led, to, a, degree, of, specialization, along, two, design, approaches, interceptors, such, as, the, english, electric, lightning, and, mikoyan, gurevich, mig, 21, f, and, fighter, bombers, such, as, the, republic, f, 105, thunderchief, and, the, sukhoi, su, 7b, dogfighting, per, se, became, de, emphasized, in, both, cases, the, interceptor, was, an, outgrowth, of, the, vision, that, guided, missiles, would, completely, replace, guns, and, combat, would, take, place, at, beyond, visual, ranges, as, a, result, strategists, designed, interceptors, with, a, large, missile, payload, and, a, powerful, radar, sacrificing, agility, in, favor, of, high, speed, altitude, ceiling, and, rate, of, climb, with, a, primary, air, defense, role, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, ability, to, intercept, strategic, bombers, flying, at, high, altitudes, specialized, point, defense, interceptors, often, had, limited, range, and, few, if, any, ground, attack, capabilities, fighter, bombers, could, swing, between, air, superiority, and, ground, attack, roles, and, were, often, designed, for, a, high, speed, low, altitude, dash, to, deliver, their, ordnance, television, and, ir, guided, air, to, surface, missiles, were, introduced, to, augment, traditional, gravity, bombs, and, some, were, also, equipped, to, deliver, a, nuclear, bomb, the, third, generation, witnessed, continued, maturation, of, second, generation, innovations, but, it, is, most, marked, by, renewed, emphases, on, maneuverability, and, on, traditional, ground, attack, capabilities, over, the, course, of, the, 1960s, increasing, combat, experience, with, guided, missiles, demonstrated, that, combat, would, devolve, into, close, in, dogfights, analog, avionics, began, to, appear, replacing, older, steam, gauge, cockpit, instrumentation, enhancements, to, the, aerodynamic, performance, of, third, generation, fighters, included, flight, control, surfaces, such, as, canards, powered, slats, and, blown, flaps, a, number, of, technologies, would, be, tried, for, vertical, short, takeoff, and, landing, but, thrust, vectoring, would, be, successful, on, the, harrier, growth, in, air, combat, capability, focused, on, the, introduction, of, improved, air, to, air, missiles, radar, systems, and, other, avionics, while, guns, remained, standard, equipment, early, models, of, f, 4, being, a, notable, exception, air, to, air, missiles, became, the, primary, weapons, for, air, superiority, fighters, which, employed, more, sophisticated, radars, and, medium, range, rf, aams, to, achieve, greater, stand, off, ranges, however, kill, probabilities, proved, unexpectedly, low, for, rf, missiles, due, to, poor, reliability, and, improved, electronic, countermeasures, ecm, for, spoofing, radar, seekers, infrared, homing, aams, saw, their, fields, of, view, expand, to, 45, which, strengthened, their, tactical, usability, nevertheless, the, low, dogfight, loss, exchange, ratios, experienced, by, american, fighters, in, the, skies, over, vietnam, led, the, u, s, navy, to, establish, its, famous, topgun, fighter, weapons, school, which, provided, a, graduate, level, curriculum, to, train, fleet, fighter, pilots, in, advanced, air, combat, maneuvering, acm, and, dissimilar, air, combat, training, dact, tactics, and, techniques, this, era, also, saw, an, expansion, in, ground, attack, capabilities, principally, in, guided, missiles, and, witnessed, the, introduction, of, the, first, truly, effective, avionics, for, enhanced, ground, attack, including, terrain, avoidance, systems, air, to, surface, missiles, asm, equipped, with, electro, optical, e, o, contrast, seekers, such, as, the, initial, model, of, the, widely, used, agm, 65, maverick, became, standard, weapons, and, laser, guided, bombs, lgbs, became, widespread, in, an, effort, to, improve, precision, attack, capabilities, guidance, for, such, precision, guided, munitions, pgm, was, provided, by, externally, mounted, targeting, pods, which, were, introduced, in, the, mid, 1960s, the, third, generation, also, led, to, the, development, of, new, automatic, fire, weapons, primarily, chain, guns, that, use, an, electric, motor, to, drive, the, mechanism, of, a, cannon, this, allowed, a, plane, to, carry, a, single, multi, barrel, weapon, such, as, the, 20, mm, 0, 79, in, vulcan, and, provided, greater, accuracy, and, rates, of, fire, powerplant, reliability, increased, and, jet, engines, became, smokeless, to, make, it, harder, to, sight, aircraft, at, long, distances, dedicated, ground, attack, aircraft, like, the, grumman, a, 6, intruder, sepecat, jaguar, and, ltv, a, 7, corsair, ii, offered, longer, range, more, sophisticated, night, attack, systems, or, lower, cost, than, supersonic, fighters, with, variable, geometry, wings, the, supersonic, f, 111, introduced, the, pratt, whitney, tf30, the, first, turbofan, equipped, with, afterburner, the, ambitious, project, sought, to, create, a, versatile, common, fighter, for, many, roles, and, services, it, would, serve, well, as, an, all, weather, bomber, but, lacked, the, performance, to, defeat, other, fighters, the, mcdonnell, f, 4, phantom, was, designed, to, capitalize, on, radar, and, missile, technology, as, an, all, weather, interceptor, but, emerged, as, a, versatile, strike, bomber, nimble, enough, to, prevail, in, air, combat, adopted, by, the, u, s, navy, air, force, and, marine, corps, despite, numerous, shortcomings, that, would, not, be, fully, addressed, until, newer, fighters, the, phantom, claimed, 280, aerial, kills, more, than, any, other, u, s, fighter, over, vietnam, with, range, and, payload, capabilities, that, rivaled, that, of, world, war, ii, bombers, such, as, b, 24, liberator, the, phantom, would, become, a, highly, successful, multirole, aircraft, fourth, generation, fighters, continued, the, trend, towards, multirole, configurations, and, were, equipped, with, increasingly, sophisticated, avionics, and, weapon, systems, fighter, designs, were, significantly, influenced, by, the, energy, maneuverability, e, m, theory, developed, by, colonel, john, boyd, and, mathematician, thomas, christie, based, upon, boyd, s, combat, experience, in, the, korean, war, and, as, a, fighter, tactics, instructor, during, the, 1960s, e, m, theory, emphasized, the, value, of, aircraft, specific, energy, maintenance, as, an, advantage, in, fighter, combat, boyd, perceived, maneuverability, as, the, primary, means, of, getting, inside, an, adversary, s, decision, making, cycle, a, process, boyd, called, the, ooda, loop, for, observation, orientation, decision, action, this, approach, emphasized, aircraft, designs, capable, of, performing, fast, transients, quick, changes, in, speed, altitude, and, direction, as, opposed, to, relying, chiefly, on, high, speed, alone, e, m, characteristics, were, first, applied, to, the, mcdonnell, douglas, f, 15, eagle, but, boyd, and, his, supporters, believed, these, performance, parameters, called, for, a, small, lightweight, aircraft, with, a, larger, higher, lift, wing, the, small, size, would, minimize, drag, and, increase, the, thrust, to, weight, ratio, while, the, larger, wing, would, minimize, wing, loading, while, the, reduced, wing, loading, tends, to, lower, top, speed, and, can, cut, range, it, increases, payload, capacity, and, the, range, reduction, can, be, compensated, for, by, increased, fuel, in, the, larger, wing, the, efforts, of, boyd, s, fighter, mafia, would, result, in, the, general, dynamics, f, 16, fighting, falcon, now, lockheed, martin, s, the, f, 16, s, maneuverability, was, further, enhanced, by, its, slight, aerodynamic, instability, this, technique, called, relaxed, static, stability, rss, was, made, possible, by, introduction, of, the, fly, by, wire, fbw, flight, control, system, flcs, which, in, turn, was, enabled, by, advances, in, computers, and, in, system, integration, techniques, analog, avionics, required, to, enable, fbw, operations, became, a, fundamental, requirement, but, began, to, be, replaced, by, digital, flight, control, systems, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 1980s, likewise, full, authority, digital, engine, controls, fadec, to, electronically, manage, powerplant, performance, was, introduced, with, the, pratt, whitney, f100, turbofan, the, f, 16, s, sole, reliance, on, electronics, and, wires, to, relay, flight, commands, instead, of, the, usual, cables, and, mechanical, linkage, controls, earned, it, the, sobriquet, of, the, electric, jet, electronic, flcs, and, fadec, quickly, became, essential, components, of, all, subsequent, fighter, designs, other, innovative, technologies, introduced, in, fourth, generation, fighters, included, pulse, doppler, fire, control, radars, providing, a, look, down, shoot, down, capability, head, up, displays, hud, hands, on, throttle, and, stick, hotas, controls, and, multi, function, displays, mfd, all, essential, equipment, as, of, 2019, aircraft, designers, began, to, incorporate, composite, materials, in, the, form, of, bonded, aluminum, honeycomb, structural, elements, and, graphite, epoxy, laminate, skins, to, reduce, weight, infrared, search, and, track, irst, sensors, became, widespread, for, air, to, ground, weapons, delivery, and, appeared, for, air, to, air, combat, as, well, all, aspect, ir, aam, became, standard, air, superiority, weapons, which, permitted, engagement, of, enemy, aircraft, from, any, angle, although, the, field, of, view, remained, relatively, limited, the, first, long, range, active, radar, homing, rf, aam, entered, service, with, the, aim, 54, phoenix, which, solely, equipped, the, grumman, f, 14, tomcat, one, of, the, few, variable, sweep, wing, fighter, designs, to, enter, production, even, with, the, tremendous, advancement, of, air, to, air, missiles, in, this, era, internal, guns, were, standard, equipment, another, revolution, came, in, the, form, of, a, stronger, reliance, on, ease, of, maintenance, which, led, to, standardization, of, parts, reductions, in, the, numbers, of, access, panels, and, lubrication, points, and, overall, parts, reduction, in, more, complicated, equipment, like, the, engines, some, early, jet, fighters, required, 50, man, hours, of, work, by, a, ground, crew, for, every, hour, the, aircraft, was, in, the, air, later, models, substantially, reduced, this, to, allow, faster, turn, around, times, and, more, sorties, in, a, day, some, modern, military, aircraft, only, require, 10, man, hours, of, work, per, hour, of, flight, time, and, others, are, even, more, efficient, aerodynamic, innovations, included, variable, camber, wings, and, exploitation, of, the, vortex, lift, effect, to, achieve, higher, angles, of, attack, through, the, addition, of, leading, edge, extension, devices, such, as, strakes, unlike, interceptors, of, the, previous, eras, most, fourth, generation, air, superiority, fighters, were, designed, to, be, agile, dogfighters, although, the, mikoyan, mig, 31, and, panavia, tornado, adv, are, notable, exceptions, the, continually, rising, cost, of, fighters, however, continued, to, emphasize, the, value, of, multirole, fighters, the, need, for, both, types, of, fighters, led, to, the, high, low, mix, concept, which, envisioned, a, high, capability, and, high, cost, core, of, dedicated, air, superiority, fighters, like, the, f, 15, and, su, 27, supplemented, by, a, larger, contingent, of, lower, cost, multi, role, fighters, such, as, the, f, 16, and, mig, 29, most, fourth, generation, fighters, such, as, the, mcdonnell, douglas, f, a, 18, hornet, hal, tejas, jf, 17, and, dassault, mirage, 2000, are, true, multirole, warplanes, designed, as, such, from, the, start, this, was, facilitated, by, multimode, avionics, that, could, switch, seamlessly, between, air, and, ground, modes, the, earlier, approaches, of, adding, on, strike, capabilities, or, designing, separate, models, specialized, for, different, roles, generally, became, pass, with, the, panavia, tornado, being, an, exception, in, this, regard, attack, roles, were, generally, assigned, to, dedicated, ground, attack, aircraft, such, as, the, sukhoi, su, 25, and, the, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, a, typical, us, air, force, fighter, wing, of, the, period, might, contain, a, mix, of, one, air, superiority, squadron, f, 15c, one, strike, fighter, squadron, f, 15e, and, two, multirole, fighter, squadrons, f, 16c, perhaps, the, most, novel, technology, introduced, for, combat, aircraft, was, stealth, which, involves, the, use, of, special, low, observable, l, o, materials, and, design, techniques, to, reduce, the, susceptibility, of, an, aircraft, to, detection, by, the, enemy, s, sensor, systems, particularly, radars, the, first, stealth, aircraft, introduced, were, the, lockheed, f, 117, nighthawk, attack, aircraft, introduced, in, 1983, and, the, northrop, grumman, b, 2, spirit, bomber, first, flew, in, 1989, although, no, stealthy, fighters, per, se, appeared, among, the, fourth, generation, some, radar, absorbent, coatings, and, other, l, o, treatments, developed, for, these, programs, are, reported, to, have, been, subsequently, applied, to, fourth, generation, fighters, the, end, of, the, cold, war, in, 1992, led, many, governments, to, significantly, decrease, military, spending, as, a, peace, dividend, air, force, inventories, were, cut, research, and, development, programs, working, on, fifth, generation, fighters, took, serious, hits, many, programs, were, canceled, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1990s, and, those, that, survived, were, stretched, out, while, the, practice, of, slowing, the, pace, of, development, reduces, annual, investment, expenses, it, comes, at, the, penalty, of, increased, overall, program, and, unit, costs, over, the, long, term, in, this, instance, however, it, also, permitted, designers, to, make, use, of, the, tremendous, achievements, being, made, in, the, fields, of, computers, avionics, and, other, flight, electronics, which, had, become, possible, largely, due, to, the, advances, made, in, microchip, and, semiconductor, technologies, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, this, opportunity, enabled, designers, to, develop, fourth, generation, designs, or, redesigns, with, significantly, enhanced, capabilities, these, improved, designs, have, become, known, as, generation, 4, 5, fighters, recognizing, their, intermediate, nature, between, the, 4th, and, 5th, generations, and, their, contribution, in, furthering, development, of, individual, fifth, generation, technologies, the, primary, characteristics, of, this, sub, generation, are, the, application, of, advanced, digital, avionics, and, aerospace, materials, modest, signature, reduction, primarily, rf, stealth, and, highly, integrated, systems, and, weapons, these, fighters, have, been, designed, to, operate, in, a, network, centric, battlefield, environment, and, are, principally, multirole, aircraft, key, weapons, technologies, introduced, include, beyond, visual, range, bvr, aams, global, positioning, system, gps, guided, weapons, solid, state, phased, array, radars, helmet, mounted, sights, and, improved, secure, jamming, resistant, datalinks, thrust, vectoring, to, further, improve, transient, maneuvering, capabilities, has, also, been, adopted, by, many, 4, 5th, generation, fighters, and, uprated, powerplants, have, enabled, some, designs, to, achieve, a, degree, of, supercruise, ability, stealth, characteristics, are, focused, primarily, on, frontal, aspect, radar, cross, section, rcs, signature, reduction, techniques, including, radar, absorbent, materials, ram, l, o, coatings, and, limited, shaping, techniques, half, generation, designs, are, either, based, on, existing, airframes, or, are, based, on, new, airframes, following, similar, design, theory, to, previous, iterations, however, these, modifications, have, introduced, the, structural, use, of, composite, materials, to, reduce, weight, greater, fuel, fractions, to, increase, range, and, signature, reduction, treatments, to, achieve, lower, rcs, compared, to, their, predecessors, prime, examples, of, such, aircraft, which, are, based, on, new, airframe, designs, making, extensive, use, of, carbon, fiber, composites, include, the, eurofighter, typhoon, dassault, rafale, saab, jas, 39, gripen, and, hal, tejas, mark, 1a, apart, from, these, fighter, jets, most, of, the, 4, 5, generation, aircraft, are, actually, modified, variants, of, existing, airframes, from, the, earlier, fourth, generation, fighter, jets, such, fighter, jets, are, generally, heavier, and, examples, include, the, boeing, f, a, 18e, f, super, hornet, which, is, an, evolution, of, the, f, a, 18, hornet, the, f, 15e, strike, eagle, which, is, a, ground, attack, multi, role, variant, of, the, f, 15, eagle, the, su, 30sm, and, su, 35s, modified, variants, of, the, sukhoi, su, 27, and, the, mig, 35, upgraded, version, of, the, mikoyan, mig, 29, the, su, 30sm, su, 35s, and, mig, 35, feature, thrust, vectoring, engine, nozzles, to, enhance, maneuvering, the, upgraded, version, of, f, 16, is, also, considered, a, member, of, the, 4, 5, generation, aircraft, generation, 4, 5, fighters, first, entered, service, in, the, early, 1990s, and, most, of, them, are, still, being, produced, and, evolved, it, is, quite, possible, that, they, may, continue, in, production, alongside, fifth, generation, fighters, due, to, the, expense, of, developing, the, advanced, level, of, stealth, technology, needed, to, achieve, aircraft, designs, featuring, very, low, observables, vlo, which, is, one, of, the, defining, features, of, fifth, generation, fighters, of, the, 4, 5th, generation, designs, the, strike, eagle, super, hornet, typhoon, gripen, and, rafale, have, been, used, in, combat, the, u, s, government, has, defined, 4, 5, generation, fighter, aircraft, as, those, that, 1, have, advanced, capabilities, including, a, aesa, radar, b, high, capacity, data, link, and, c, enhanced, avionics, and, 2, have, the, ability, to, deploy, current, and, reasonably, foreseeable, advanced, armaments, currently, the, cutting, edge, of, fighter, design, fifth, generation, fighters, are, characterized, by, being, designed, from, the, start, to, operate, in, a, network, centric, combat, environment, and, to, feature, extremely, low, all, aspect, multi, spectral, signatures, employing, advanced, materials, and, shaping, techniques, they, have, multifunction, aesa, radars, with, high, bandwidth, low, probability, of, intercept, lpi, data, transmission, capabilities, the, infra, red, search, and, track, sensors, incorporated, for, air, to, air, combat, as, well, as, for, air, to, ground, weapons, delivery, in, the, 4, 5th, generation, fighters, are, now, fused, in, with, other, sensors, for, situational, awareness, irst, or, sairst, which, constantly, tracks, all, targets, of, interest, around, the, aircraft, so, the, pilot, need, not, guess, when, he, glances, these, sensors, along, with, advanced, avionics, glass, cockpits, helmet, mounted, sights, not, currently, on, f, 22, and, improved, secure, jamming, resistant, lpi, datalinks, are, highly, integrated, to, provide, multi, platform, multi, sensor, data, fusion, for, vastly, improved, situational, awareness, while, easing, the, pilot, s, workload, avionics, suites, rely, on, extensive, use, of, very, high, speed, integrated, circuit, vhsic, technology, common, modules, and, high, speed, data, buses, overall, the, integration, of, all, these, elements, is, claimed, to, provide, fifth, generation, fighters, with, a, first, look, first, shot, first, kill, capability, a, key, attribute, of, fifth, generation, fighters, is, a, small, radar, cross, section, great, care, has, been, taken, in, designing, its, layout, and, internal, structure, to, minimize, rcs, over, a, broad, bandwidth, of, detection, and, tracking, radar, frequencies, furthermore, to, maintain, its, vlo, signature, during, combat, operations, primary, weapons, are, carried, in, internal, weapon, bays, that, are, only, briefly, opened, to, permit, weapon, launch, furthermore, stealth, technology, has, advanced, to, the, point, where, it, can, be, employed, without, a, tradeoff, with, aerodynamics, performance, in, contrast, to, previous, stealth, efforts, some, attention, has, also, been, paid, to, reducing, ir, signatures, especially, on, the, f, 22, detailed, information, on, these, signature, reduction, techniques, is, classified, but, in, general, includes, special, shaping, approaches, thermoset, and, thermoplastic, materials, extensive, structural, use, of, advanced, composites, conformal, sensors, heat, resistant, coatings, low, observable, wire, meshes, to, cover, intake, and, cooling, vents, heat, ablating, tiles, on, the, exhaust, troughs, seen, on, the, northrop, yf, 23, and, coating, internal, and, external, metal, areas, with, radar, absorbent, materials, and, paint, ram, rap, the, aesa, radar, offers, unique, capabilities, for, fighters, and, it, is, also, quickly, becoming, essential, for, generation, 4, 5, aircraft, designs, as, well, as, being, retrofitted, onto, some, fourth, generation, aircraft, in, addition, to, its, high, resistance, to, ecm, and, lpi, features, it, enables, the, fighter, to, function, as, a, sort, of, mini, awacs, providing, high, gain, electronic, support, measures, esm, and, electronic, warfare, ew, jamming, functions, other, technologies, common, to, this, latest, generation, of, fighters, includes, integrated, electronic, warfare, system, inews, technology, integrated, communications, navigation, and, identification, cni, avionics, technology, centralized, vehicle, health, monitoring, systems, for, ease, of, maintenance, fiber, optics, data, transmission, stealth, technology, and, even, hovering, capabilities, maneuver, performance, remains, important, and, is, enhanced, by, thrust, vectoring, which, also, helps, reduce, takeoff, and, landing, distances, supercruise, may, or, may, not, be, featured, it, permits, flight, at, supersonic, speeds, without, the, use, of, the, afterburner, a, device, that, significantly, increases, ir, signature, when, used, in, full, military, power, such, aircraft, are, sophisticated, and, expensive, the, fifth, generation, was, ushered, in, by, the, lockheed, martin, boeing, f, 22, raptor, in, late, 2005, the, u, s, air, force, originally, planned, to, acquire, 650, f, 22s, but, now, only, 187, will, be, built, as, a, result, its, unit, flyaway, cost, fac, is, around, us, 150, million, to, spread, the, development, costs, and, production, base, more, broadly, the, joint, strike, fighter, jsf, program, enrolls, eight, other, countries, as, cost, and, risk, sharing, partners, altogether, the, nine, partner, nations, anticipate, procuring, over, 3, 000, lockheed, martin, f, 35, lightning, ii, fighters, at, an, anticipated, average, fac, of, 80, 85, million, the, f, 35, however, is, designed, to, be, a, family, of, three, aircraft, a, conventional, take, off, and, landing, ctol, fighter, a, short, take, off, and, vertical, landing, stovl, fighter, and, a, catapult, assisted, take, off, but, arrested, recovery, catobar, fighter, each, of, which, has, a, different, unit, price, and, slightly, varying, specifications, in, terms, of, fuel, capacity, and, therefore, range, size, and, payload, other, countries, have, initiated, fifth, generation, fighter, development, projects, in, december, 2010, it, was, discovered, that, china, is, developing, the, 5th, generation, fighter, chengdu, j, 20, the, j, 20, took, its, maiden, flight, in, january, 2011, the, shenyang, fc, 31, took, its, maiden, flight, on, 31, october, 2012, and, developed, a, carrier, based, version, based, on, chinese, aircraft, carriers, united, aircraft, corporation, with, russia, s, mikoyan, lmfs, and, sukhoi, su, 75, checkmate, plan, sukhoi, su, 57, became, the, first, fifth, generation, fighter, jets, in, service, with, the, russian, aerospace, forces, on, 2020, and, launch, missiles, in, the, russo, ukrainian, war, in, 2022, japan, is, exploring, its, technical, feasibility, to, produce, fifth, generation, fighters, india, is, developing, the, advanced, medium, combat, aircraft, amca, a, medium, weight, stealth, fighter, jet, designated, to, enter, into, serial, production, by, late, 2030s, india, also, had, initiated, a, joint, fifth, generation, heavy, fighter, with, russia, called, the, fgfa, as, of, 2018, may, the, project, is, suspected, to, have, not, yielded, desired, progress, or, results, for, india, and, has, been, put, on, hold, or, dropped, altogether, other, countries, considering, fielding, an, indigenous, or, semi, indigenous, advanced, fifth, generation, aircraft, include, south, korea, sweden, turkey, and, pakistan, as, of, november, 2018, france, germany, china, japan, russia, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, have, announced, the, development, of, a, sixth, generation, aircraft, program, france, and, germany, will, develop, a, joint, sixth, generation, fighter, to, replace, their, current, fleet, of, dassault, rafales, eurofighter, typhoons, and, panavia, tornados, by, 2035, the, overall, development, will, be, led, by, a, collaboration, of, dassault, and, airbus, while, the, engines, will, reportedly, be, jointly, developed, by, safran, and, mtu, aero, engines, thales, and, mbda, are, also, seeking, a, stake, in, the, project, spain, officially, joined, the, franco, german, project, to, develop, a, next, generation, fighter, ngf, that, will, form, part, of, a, broader, future, combat, air, systems, fcas, with, the, signing, of, a, letter, of, intent, loi, on, february, 14, 2019, currently, at, the, concept, stage, the, first, sixth, generation, jet, fighter, is, expected, to, enter, service, in, the, united, states, navy, in, 2025, 30, period, the, usaf, seeks, a, new, fighter, for, the, 2030, 50, period, named, the, next, generation, tactical, aircraft, next, gen, tacair, the, us, navy, looks, to, replace, its, f, a, 18e, f, super, hornets, beginning, in, 2025, with, the, next, generation, air, dominance, air, superiority, fighter, the, united, kingdom, s, proposed, stealth, fighter, is, being, developed, by, a, european, consortium, called, team, tempest, consisting, of, bae, systems, rolls, royce, leonardo, s, p, a, and, mbda, the, aircraft, is, intended, to, enter, service, in, 2035, fighters, were, typically, armed, with, guns, only, for, air, to, air, combat, up, through, the, late, 1950s, though, unguided, rockets, for, mostly, air, to, ground, use, and, limited, air, to, air, use, were, deployed, in, wwii, from, the, late, 1950s, forward, guided, missiles, came, into, use, for, air, to, air, combat, throughout, this, history, fighters, which, by, surprise, or, maneuver, attain, a, good, firing, position, have, achieved, the, kill, about, one, third, to, one, half, the, time, no, matter, what, weapons, were, carried, the, only, major, historic, exception, to, this, has, been, the, low, effectiveness, shown, by, guided, missiles, in, the, first, one, to, two, decades, of, their, existence, from, wwi, to, the, present, fighter, aircraft, have, featured, machine, guns, and, automatic, cannons, as, weapons, and, they, are, still, considered, as, essential, back, up, weapons, today, the, power, of, air, to, air, guns, has, increased, greatly, over, time, and, has, kept, them, relevant, in, the, guided, missile, era, in, wwi, two, rifle, approximately, 0, 30, caliber, machine, guns, was, the, typical, armament, producing, a, weight, of, fire, of, about, 0, 4, kg, 0, 88, lb, per, second, in, wwii, rifle, caliber, machine, guns, also, remained, common, though, usually, in, larger, numbers, or, supplemented, with, much, heavier, 0, 50, caliber, machine, guns, or, cannons, the, standard, wwii, american, fighter, armament, of, six, 0, 50, cal, 12, 7mm, machine, guns, fired, a, bullet, weight, of, approximately, 3, 7, kg, sec, 8, 1, lbs, sec, at, a, muzzle, velocity, of, 856, m, s, 2, 810, ft, s, british, and, german, aircraft, tended, to, use, a, mix, of, machine, guns, and, autocannon, the, latter, firing, explosive, projectiles, later, british, fighters, were, exclusively, cannon, armed, the, us, were, not, able, to, produce, a, reliable, cannon, in, high, numbers, and, most, fighters, remained, equipped, only, with, heavy, machine, guns, despite, the, us, navy, pressing, for, a, change, to, 20, mm, post, war, 20, 30, mm, revolver, cannon, and, rotary, cannon, were, introduced, the, modern, m61, vulcan, 20, mm, rotary, cannon, that, is, standard, on, current, american, fighters, fires, a, projectile, weight, of, about, 10, kg, s, 22, lb, s, nearly, three, times, that, of, six, 0, 50, cal, machine, guns, with, higher, velocity, of, 1, 052, m, s, 3450, ft, s, supporting, a, flatter, trajectory, and, with, exploding, projectiles, modern, fighter, gun, systems, also, feature, ranging, radar, and, lead, computing, electronic, gun, sights, to, ease, the, problem, of, aim, point, to, compensate, for, projectile, drop, and, time, of, flight, target, lead, in, the, complex, three, dimensional, maneuvering, of, air, to, air, combat, however, getting, in, position, to, use, the, guns, is, still, a, challenge, the, range, of, guns, is, longer, than, in, the, past, but, still, quite, limited, compared, to, missiles, with, modern, gun, systems, having, a, maximum, effective, range, of, approximately, 1, 000, meters, high, probability, of, kill, also, requires, firing, to, usually, occur, from, the, rear, hemisphere, of, the, target, despite, these, limits, when, pilots, are, well, trained, in, air, to, air, gunnery, and, these, conditions, are, satisfied, gun, systems, are, tactically, effective, and, highly, cost, efficient, the, cost, of, a, gun, firing, pass, is, far, less, than, firing, a, missile, and, the, projectiles, are, not, subject, to, the, thermal, and, electronic, countermeasures, than, can, sometimes, defeat, missiles, when, the, enemy, can, be, approached, to, within, gun, range, the, lethality, of, guns, is, approximately, a, 25, to, 50, chance, of, kill, per, firing, pass, the, range, limitations, of, guns, and, the, desire, to, overcome, large, variations, in, fighter, pilot, skill, and, thus, achieve, higher, force, effectiveness, led, to, the, development, of, the, guided, air, to, air, missile, there, are, two, main, variations, heat, seeking, infrared, homing, and, radar, guided, radar, missiles, are, typically, several, times, heavier, and, more, expensive, than, heat, seekers, but, with, longer, range, greater, destructive, power, and, ability, to, track, through, clouds, the, highly, successful, aim, 9, sidewinder, heat, seeking, infrared, homing, short, range, missile, was, developed, by, the, united, states, navy, in, the, 1950s, these, small, missiles, are, easily, carried, by, lighter, fighters, and, provide, effective, ranges, of, approximately, 10, to, 35, kilometres, 6, to, 20, mi, beginning, with, the, aim, 9l, in, 1977, subsequent, versions, of, sidewinder, have, added, all, aspect, capability, the, ability, to, use, the, lower, heat, of, air, to, skin, friction, on, the, target, aircraft, to, track, from, the, front, and, sides, the, latest, 2003, service, entry, aim, 9x, also, features, off, boresight, and, lock, on, after, launch, capabilities, which, allow, the, pilot, to, make, a, quick, launch, of, a, missile, to, track, a, target, anywhere, within, the, pilot, s, vision, the, aim, 9x, development, cost, was, u, s, 3, billion, in, mid, to, late, 1990s, dollars, and, 2015, per, unit, procurement, cost, is, 0, 6, million, each, the, missile, weighs, 85, 3, kg, 188, lbs, and, has, a, maximum, range, of, 35, km, 22, miles, at, higher, altitudes, like, most, air, to, air, missiles, lower, altitude, range, can, be, as, limited, as, only, about, one, third, of, maximum, due, to, higher, drag, and, less, ability, to, coast, downward, the, effectiveness, of, infrared, homing, missiles, was, only, 7, early, in, the, vietnam, war, but, improved, to, approximately, 15, 40, over, the, course, of, the, war, the, aim, 4, falcon, used, by, the, usaf, had, kill, rates, of, approximately, 7, and, was, considered, a, failure, the, aim, 9b, sidewinder, introduced, later, achieved, 15, kill, rates, and, the, further, improved, aim, 9d, and, j, models, reached, 19, the, aim, 9g, used, in, the, last, year, of, the, vietnam, air, war, achieved, 40, israel, used, almost, totally, guns, in, the, 1967, six, day, war, achieving, 60, kills, and, 10, losses, however, israel, made, much, more, use, of, steadily, improving, heat, seeking, missiles, in, the, 1973, yom, kippur, war, in, this, extensive, conflict, israel, scored, 171, of, 261, total, kills, with, heat, seeking, missiles, 65, 5, 5, kills, with, radar, guided, missiles, 1, 9, and, 85, kills, with, guns, 32, 6, the, aim, 9l, sidewinder, scored, 19, kills, out, of, 26, fired, missiles, 73, in, the, 1982, falklands, war, but, in, a, conflict, against, opponents, using, thermal, countermeasures, the, united, states, only, scored, 11, kills, out, of, 48, fired, pk, 23, with, the, follow, on, aim, 9m, in, the, 1991, gulf, war, radar, guided, missiles, fall, into, two, main, missile, guidance, types, in, the, historically, more, common, semi, active, radar, homing, case, the, missile, homes, in, on, radar, signals, transmitted, from, launching, aircraft, and, reflected, from, the, target, this, has, the, disadvantage, that, the, firing, aircraft, must, maintain, radar, lock, on, the, target, and, is, thus, less, free, to, maneuver, and, more, vulnerable, to, attack, a, widely, deployed, missile, of, this, type, was, the, aim, 7, sparrow, which, entered, service, in, 1954, and, was, produced, in, improving, versions, until, 1997, in, more, advanced, active, radar, homing, the, missile, is, guided, to, the, vicinity, of, the, target, by, internal, data, on, its, projected, position, and, then, goes, active, with, an, internally, carried, small, radar, system, to, conduct, terminal, guidance, to, the, target, this, eliminates, the, requirement, for, the, firing, aircraft, to, maintain, radar, lock, and, thus, greatly, reduces, risk, a, prominent, example, is, the, aim, 120, amraam, which, was, first, fielded, in, 1991, as, the, aim, 7, replacement, and, which, has, no, firm, retirement, date, as, of, 2016, the, current, aim, 120d, version, has, a, maximum, high, altitude, range, of, greater, than, 160, km, 100, mi, and, cost, approximately, 2, 4, million, each, 2016, as, is, typical, with, most, other, missiles, range, at, lower, altitude, may, be, as, little, as, one, third, that, of, high, altitude, in, the, vietnam, air, war, radar, missile, kill, reliability, was, approximately, 10, at, shorter, ranges, and, even, worse, at, longer, ranges, due, to, reduced, radar, return, and, greater, time, for, the, target, aircraft, to, detect, the, incoming, missile, and, take, evasive, action, at, one, point, in, the, vietnam, war, the, u, s, navy, fired, 50, aim, 7, sparrow, radar, guided, missiles, in, a, row, without, a, hit, between, 1958, and, 1982, in, five, wars, there, were, 2, 014, combined, heat, seeking, and, radar, guided, missile, firings, by, fighter, pilots, engaged, in, air, to, air, combat, achieving, 528, kills, of, which, 76, were, radar, missile, kills, for, a, combined, effectiveness, of, 26, however, only, 4, of, the, 76, radar, missile, kills, were, in, the, beyond, visual, range, mode, intended, to, be, the, strength, of, radar, guided, missiles, the, united, states, invested, over, 10, billion, in, air, to, air, radar, missile, technology, from, the, 1950s, to, the, early, 1970s, amortized, over, actual, kills, achieved, by, the, u, s, and, its, allies, each, radar, guided, missile, kill, thus, cost, over, 130, million, the, defeated, enemy, aircraft, were, for, the, most, part, older, mig, 17s, 19s, and, 21s, with, new, cost, of, 0, 3, million, to, 3, million, each, thus, the, radar, missile, investment, over, that, period, far, exceeded, the, value, of, enemy, aircraft, destroyed, and, furthermore, had, very, little, of, the, intended, bvr, effectiveness, however, continuing, heavy, development, investment, and, rapidly, advancing, electronic, technology, led, to, significant, improvement, in, radar, missile, reliabilities, from, the, late, 1970s, onward, radar, guided, missiles, achieved, 75, pk, 9, kills, out, of, 12, shots, in, operations, in, the, gulf, war, in, 1991, the, percentage, of, kills, achieved, by, radar, guided, missiles, also, surpassed, 50, of, total, kills, for, the, first, time, by, 1991, since, 1991, 20, of, 61, kills, worldwide, have, been, beyond, visual, range, using, radar, missiles, discounting, an, accidental, friendly, fire, kill, in, operational, use, the, aim, 120d, the, current, main, american, radar, guided, missile, has, achieved, 9, kills, out, of, 16, shots, for, a, 56, pk, six, of, these, kills, were, bvr, out, of, 13, shots, for, a, 46, bvr, pk, though, all, these, kills, were, against, less, capable, opponents, who, were, not, equipped, with, operating, radar, electronic, countermeasures, or, a, comparable, weapon, themselves, the, bvr, pk, was, a, significant, improvement, from, earlier, eras, however, a, current, concern, is, electronic, countermeasures, to, radar, missiles, which, are, thought, to, be, reducing, the, effectiveness, of, the, aim, 120d, some, experts, believe, that, as, of, 2016, the, european, meteor, missile, the, russian, r, 37m, and, the, chinese, pl, 15, are, more, resistant, to, countermeasures, and, more, effective, than, the, aim, 120d, now, that, higher, reliabilities, have, been, achieved, both, types, of, missiles, allow, the, fighter, pilot, to, often, avoid, the, risk, of, the, short, range, dogfight, where, only, the, more, experienced, and, skilled, fighter, pilots, tend, to, prevail, and, where, even, the, finest, fighter, pilot, can, simply, get, unlucky, taking, maximum, advantage, of, complicated, missile, parameters, in, both, attack, and, defense, against, competent, opponents, does, take, considerable, experience, and, skill, but, against, surprised, opponents, lacking, comparable, capability, and, countermeasures, air, to, air, missile, warfare, is, relatively, simple, by, partially, automating, air, to, air, combat, and, reducing, reliance, on, gun, kills, mostly, achieved, by, only, a, small, expert, fraction, of, fighter, pilots, air, to, air, missiles, now, serve, as, highly, effective, force, multipliers
