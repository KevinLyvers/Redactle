in, radio, engineering, an, antenna, american, english, or, aerial, british, english, is, an, electronic, device, that, converts, an, alternating, electric, current, into, radio, waves, or, radio, waves, into, an, electric, current, it, is, the, interface, between, radio, waves, propagating, through, space, and, electric, currents, moving, in, metal, conductors, used, with, a, transmitter, or, receiver, in, transmission, a, radio, transmitter, supplies, an, electric, current, to, the, antenna, s, terminals, and, the, antenna, radiates, the, energy, from, the, current, as, electromagnetic, waves, radio, waves, in, reception, an, antenna, intercepts, some, of, the, power, of, a, radio, wave, in, order, to, produce, an, electric, current, at, its, terminals, that, is, applied, to, a, receiver, to, be, amplified, antennas, are, essential, components, of, all, radio, equipment, an, antenna, is, an, array, of, conductors, elements, electrically, connected, to, the, receiver, or, transmitter, antennas, can, be, designed, to, transmit, and, receive, radio, waves, in, all, horizontal, directions, equally, omnidirectional, antennas, or, preferentially, in, a, particular, direction, directional, or, high, gain, or, beam, antennas, an, antenna, may, include, components, not, connected, to, the, transmitter, parabolic, reflectors, horns, or, parasitic, elements, which, serve, to, direct, the, radio, waves, into, a, beam, or, other, desired, radiation, pattern, strong, directivity, and, good, efficiency, when, transmitting, are, hard, to, achieve, with, antennas, with, dimensions, that, are, much, smaller, than, a, half, wavelength, the, first, antennas, were, built, in, 1888, by, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, in, his, pioneering, experiments, to, prove, the, existence, of, electromagnetic, waves, predicted, by, the, 1867, electromagnetic, theory, of, james, clerk, maxwell, hertz, placed, dipole, antennas, at, the, focal, point, of, parabolic, reflectors, for, both, transmitting, and, receiving, starting, in, 1895, guglielmo, marconi, began, development, of, antennas, practical, for, long, distance, wireless, telegraphy, for, which, he, received, the, 1909, nobel, prize, in, physics, the, words, antenna, and, aerial, are, used, interchangeably, occasionally, the, equivalent, term, aerial, is, used, to, specifically, mean, an, elevated, horizontal, wire, antenna, the, origin, of, the, word, antenna, relative, to, wireless, apparatus, is, attributed, to, italian, radio, pioneer, guglielmo, marconi, in, the, summer, of, 1895, marconi, began, testing, his, wireless, system, outdoors, on, his, father, s, estate, near, bologna, and, soon, began, to, experiment, with, long, wire, aerials, suspended, from, a, pole, in, italian, a, tent, pole, is, known, as, l, antenna, centrale, and, the, pole, with, the, wire, was, simply, called, l, antenna, until, then, wireless, radiating, transmitting, and, receiving, elements, were, known, simply, as, terminals, because, of, his, prominence, marconi, s, use, of, the, word, antenna, spread, among, wireless, researchers, and, enthusiasts, and, later, to, the, general, public, antenna, may, refer, broadly, to, an, entire, assembly, including, support, structure, enclosure, if, any, etc, in, addition, to, the, actual, rf, current, carrying, components, a, receiving, antenna, may, include, not, only, the, passive, metal, receiving, elements, but, also, an, integrated, preamplifier, or, mixer, especially, at, and, above, microwave, frequencies, antennas, are, required, by, any, radio, receiver, or, transmitter, to, couple, its, electrical, connection, to, the, electromagnetic, field, radio, waves, are, electromagnetic, waves, which, carry, signals, through, the, air, or, through, space, at, the, speed, of, light, with, almost, no, transmission, loss, antennas, can, be, classified, as, omnidirectional, radiating, energy, approximately, equally, in, all, horizontal, directions, or, directional, where, radio, waves, are, concentrated, in, some, direction, s, a, so, called, beam, antenna, is, unidirectional, designed, for, maximum, response, in, the, direction, of, the, other, station, whereas, many, other, antennas, are, intended, to, accommodate, stations, in, various, directions, but, are, not, truly, omnidirectional, since, antennas, obey, reciprocity, the, same, radiation, pattern, applies, to, transmission, as, well, as, reception, of, radio, waves, a, hypothetical, antenna, that, radiates, equally, in, all, directions, vertical, as, well, as, all, horizontal, angles, is, called, an, isotropic, radiator, however, these, cannot, exist, in, practice, nor, would, they, be, particularly, desired, for, most, terrestrial, communications, rather, there, is, an, advantage, in, reducing, radiation, toward, the, sky, or, ground, in, favor, of, horizontal, direction, s, a, dipole, antenna, oriented, horizontally, sends, no, energy, in, the, direction, of, the, conductor, this, is, called, the, antenna, null, but, is, usable, in, most, other, directions, a, number, of, such, dipole, elements, can, be, combined, into, an, antenna, array, such, as, the, yagi, uda, in, order, to, favor, a, single, horizontal, direction, thus, termed, a, beam, antenna, the, dipole, antenna, which, is, the, basis, for, most, antenna, designs, is, a, balanced, component, with, equal, but, opposite, voltages, and, currents, applied, at, its, two, terminals, the, vertical, antenna, is, a, monopole, antenna, not, balanced, with, respect, to, ground, the, ground, or, any, large, conductive, surface, plays, the, role, of, the, second, conductor, of, a, monopole, since, monopole, antennas, rely, on, a, conductive, surface, they, may, be, mounted, with, a, ground, plane, to, approximate, the, effect, of, being, mounted, on, the, earth, s, surface, more, complex, antennas, increase, the, directivity, of, the, antenna, additional, elements, in, the, antenna, structure, which, need, not, be, directly, connected, to, the, receiver, or, transmitter, increase, its, directionality, antenna, gain, describes, the, concentration, of, radiated, power, into, a, particular, solid, angle, of, space, gain, is, perhaps, an, unfortunately, chosen, term, by, comparison, with, amplifier, gain, which, implies, a, net, increase, in, power, in, contrast, for, antenna, gain, the, power, increased, in, the, desired, direction, is, at, the, expense, of, power, reduced, in, undesired, directions, unlike, amplifiers, antennas, are, electrically, passive, devices, which, conserve, total, power, and, there, is, no, increase, in, total, power, above, that, delivered, from, the, power, source, the, transmitter, only, improved, distribution, of, that, fixed, total, a, phased, array, consists, of, two, or, more, simple, antennas, which, are, connected, together, through, an, electrical, network, this, often, involves, a, number, of, parallel, dipole, antennas, with, a, certain, spacing, depending, on, the, relative, phase, introduced, by, the, network, the, same, combination, of, dipole, antennas, can, operate, as, a, broadside, array, directional, normal, to, a, line, connecting, the, elements, or, as, an, end, fire, array, directional, along, the, line, connecting, the, elements, antenna, arrays, may, employ, any, basic, omnidirectional, or, weakly, directional, antenna, type, such, as, dipole, loop, or, slot, antennas, these, elements, are, often, identical, log, periodic, and, frequency, independent, antennas, employ, self, similarity, in, order, to, be, operational, over, a, wide, range, of, bandwidths, the, most, familiar, example, is, the, log, periodic, dipole, array, which, can, be, seen, as, a, number, typically, 10, to, 20, of, connected, dipole, elements, with, progressive, lengths, in, an, endfire, array, making, it, rather, directional, it, finds, use, especially, as, a, rooftop, antenna, for, television, reception, on, the, other, hand, a, yagi, uda, antenna, or, simply, yagi, with, a, somewhat, similar, appearance, has, only, one, dipole, element, with, an, electrical, connection, the, other, parasitic, elements, interact, with, the, electromagnetic, field, in, order, to, realize, a, highly, directional, antenna, but, with, a, narrow, bandwidth, even, greater, directionality, can, be, obtained, using, aperture, antennas, such, as, the, parabolic, reflector, or, horn, antenna, since, high, directivity, in, an, antenna, depends, on, it, being, large, compared, to, the, wavelength, highly, directional, antennas, thus, with, high, antenna, gain, become, more, practical, at, higher, frequencies, uhf, and, above, at, low, frequencies, such, as, am, broadcast, arrays, of, vertical, towers, are, used, to, achieve, directionality, and, they, will, occupy, large, areas, of, land, for, reception, a, long, beverage, antenna, can, have, significant, directivity, for, non, directional, portable, use, a, short, vertical, antenna, or, small, loop, antenna, works, well, with, the, main, design, challenge, being, that, of, impedance, matching, with, a, vertical, antenna, a, loading, coil, at, the, base, of, the, antenna, may, be, employed, to, cancel, the, reactive, component, of, impedance, small, loop, antennas, are, tuned, with, parallel, capacitors, for, this, purpose, an, antenna, lead, in, is, the, transmission, line, or, feed, line, which, connects, the, antenna, to, a, transmitter, or, receiver, the, antenna, feed, may, refer, to, all, components, connecting, the, antenna, to, the, transmitter, or, receiver, such, as, an, impedance, matching, network, in, addition, to, the, transmission, line, in, a, so, called, aperture, antenna, such, as, a, horn, or, parabolic, dish, the, feed, may, also, refer, to, a, basic, radiating, antenna, embedded, in, the, entire, system, of, reflecting, elements, normally, at, the, focus, of, the, parabolic, dish, or, at, the, throat, of, a, horn, which, could, be, considered, the, one, active, element, in, that, antenna, system, a, microwave, antenna, may, also, be, fed, directly, from, a, waveguide, in, place, of, a, conductive, transmission, line, an, antenna, counterpoise, or, ground, plane, is, a, structure, of, conductive, material, which, improves, or, substitutes, for, the, ground, it, may, be, connected, to, or, insulated, from, the, natural, ground, in, a, monopole, antenna, this, aids, in, the, function, of, the, natural, ground, particularly, where, variations, or, limitations, of, the, characteristics, of, the, natural, ground, interfere, with, its, proper, function, such, a, structure, is, normally, connected, to, the, return, connection, of, an, unbalanced, transmission, line, such, as, the, shield, of, a, coaxial, cable, an, electromagnetic, wave, refractor, in, some, aperture, antennas, is, a, component, which, due, to, its, shape, and, position, functions, to, selectively, delay, or, advance, portions, of, the, electromagnetic, wavefront, passing, through, it, the, refractor, alters, the, spatial, characteristics, of, the, wave, on, one, side, relative, to, the, other, side, it, can, for, instance, bring, the, wave, to, a, focus, or, alter, the, wave, front, in, other, ways, generally, in, order, to, maximize, the, directivity, of, the, antenna, system, this, is, the, radio, equivalent, of, an, optical, lens, an, antenna, coupling, network, is, a, passive, network, generally, a, combination, of, inductive, and, capacitive, circuit, elements, used, for, impedance, matching, in, between, the, antenna, and, the, transmitter, or, receiver, this, may, be, used, to, minimize, losses, on, the, feed, line, by, reducing, transmission, line, s, standing, wave, ratio, and, to, present, the, transmitter, or, receiver, with, a, standard, resistive, impedance, needed, for, its, optimum, operation, the, feed, point, location, s, is, selected, and, antenna, elements, electrically, similar, to, tuner, components, may, be, incorporated, in, the, antenna, structure, itself, to, improve, the, match, it, is, a, fundamental, property, of, antennas, that, most, of, the, electrical, characteristics, of, an, antenna, such, as, those, described, in, the, next, section, e, g, gain, radiation, pattern, impedance, bandwidth, resonant, frequency, and, polarization, are, the, same, whether, the, antenna, is, transmitting, or, receiving, for, example, the, receiving, pattern, sensitivity, to, incoming, signals, as, a, function, of, direction, of, an, antenna, when, used, for, reception, is, identical, to, the, radiation, pattern, of, the, antenna, when, it, is, driven, and, functions, as, a, radiator, even, though, the, current, and, voltage, distributions, on, the, antenna, itself, are, different, for, receiving, and, sending, this, is, a, consequence, of, the, reciprocity, theorem, of, electromagnetics, therefore, in, discussions, of, antenna, properties, no, distinction, is, usually, made, between, receiving, and, transmitting, terminology, and, the, antenna, can, be, viewed, as, either, transmitting, or, receiving, whichever, is, more, convenient, a, necessary, condition, for, the, aforementioned, reciprocity, property, is, that, the, materials, in, the, antenna, and, transmission, medium, are, linear, and, reciprocal, reciprocal, or, bilateral, means, that, the, material, has, the, same, response, to, an, electric, current, or, magnetic, field, in, one, direction, as, it, has, to, the, field, or, current, in, the, opposite, direction, most, materials, used, in, antennas, meet, these, conditions, but, some, microwave, antennas, use, high, tech, components, such, as, isolators, and, circulators, made, of, nonreciprocal, materials, such, as, ferrite, these, can, be, used, to, give, the, antenna, a, different, behavior, on, receiving, than, it, has, on, transmitting, which, can, be, useful, in, applications, like, radar, the, majority, of, antenna, designs, are, based, on, the, resonance, principle, this, relies, on, the, behaviour, of, moving, electrons, which, reflect, off, surfaces, where, the, dielectric, constant, changes, in, a, fashion, similar, to, the, way, light, reflects, when, optical, properties, change, in, these, designs, the, reflective, surface, is, created, by, the, end, of, a, conductor, normally, a, thin, metal, wire, or, rod, which, in, the, simplest, case, has, a, feed, point, at, one, end, where, it, is, connected, to, a, transmission, line, the, conductor, or, element, is, aligned, with, the, electrical, field, of, the, desired, signal, normally, meaning, it, is, perpendicular, to, the, line, from, the, antenna, to, the, source, or, receiver, in, the, case, of, a, broadcast, antenna, the, radio, signal, s, electrical, component, induces, a, voltage, in, the, conductor, this, causes, an, electrical, current, to, begin, flowing, in, the, direction, of, the, signal, s, instantaneous, field, when, the, resulting, current, reaches, the, end, of, the, conductor, it, reflects, which, is, equivalent, to, a, 180, degree, change, in, phase, if, the, conductor, is, 1, 4, of, a, wavelength, long, current, from, the, feed, point, will, undergo, 90, degree, phase, change, by, the, time, it, reaches, the, end, of, the, conductor, reflect, through, 180, degrees, and, then, another, 90, degrees, as, it, travels, back, that, means, it, has, undergone, a, total, 360, degree, phase, change, returning, it, to, the, original, signal, the, current, in, the, element, thus, adds, to, the, current, being, created, from, the, source, at, that, instant, this, process, creates, a, standing, wave, in, the, conductor, with, the, maximum, current, at, the, feed, the, ordinary, half, wave, dipole, is, probably, the, most, widely, used, antenna, design, this, consists, of, two, 1, 4, wavelength, elements, arranged, end, to, end, and, lying, along, essentially, the, same, axis, or, collinear, each, feeding, one, side, of, a, two, conductor, transmission, wire, the, physical, arrangement, of, the, two, elements, places, them, 180, degrees, out, of, phase, which, means, that, at, any, given, instant, one, of, the, elements, is, driving, current, into, the, transmission, line, while, the, other, is, pulling, it, out, the, monopole, antenna, is, essentially, one, half, of, the, half, wave, dipole, a, single, 1, 4, wavelength, element, with, the, other, side, connected, to, ground, or, an, equivalent, ground, plane, or, counterpoise, monopoles, which, are, one, half, the, size, of, a, dipole, are, common, for, long, wavelength, radio, signals, where, a, dipole, would, be, impractically, large, another, common, design, is, the, folded, dipole, which, consists, of, two, or, more, half, wave, dipoles, placed, side, by, side, and, connected, at, their, ends, but, only, one, of, which, is, driven, the, standing, wave, forms, with, this, desired, pattern, at, the, design, operating, frequency, f, o, and, antennas, are, normally, designed, to, be, this, size, however, feeding, that, element, with, 3, f, o, whose, wavelength, is, 1, 3, that, of, f, o, will, also, lead, to, a, standing, wave, pattern, thus, an, antenna, element, is, also, resonant, when, its, length, is, 3, 4, of, a, wavelength, this, is, true, for, all, odd, multiples, of, 1, 4, wavelength, this, allows, some, flexibility, of, design, in, terms, of, antenna, lengths, and, feed, points, antennas, used, in, such, a, fashion, are, known, to, be, harmonically, operated, resonant, antennas, usually, use, a, linear, conductor, or, element, or, pair, of, such, elements, each, of, which, is, about, a, quarter, of, the, wavelength, in, length, an, odd, multiple, of, quarter, wavelengths, will, also, be, resonant, antennas, that, are, required, to, be, small, compared, to, the, wavelength, sacrifice, efficiency, and, cannot, be, very, directional, since, wavelengths, are, so, small, at, higher, frequencies, uhf, microwaves, trading, off, performance, to, obtain, a, smaller, physical, size, is, usually, not, required, the, quarter, wave, elements, imitate, a, series, resonant, electrical, element, due, to, the, standing, wave, present, along, the, conductor, at, the, resonant, frequency, the, standing, wave, has, a, current, peak, and, voltage, node, minimum, at, the, feed, in, electrical, terms, this, means, that, at, that, position, the, element, has, minimum, impedance, magnitude, generating, the, maximum, current, for, minimum, voltage, this, is, the, ideal, situation, because, it, produces, the, maximum, output, for, the, minimum, input, producing, the, highest, possible, efficiency, contrary, to, an, ideal, lossless, series, resonant, circuit, a, finite, resistance, remains, corresponding, to, the, relatively, small, voltage, at, the, feed, point, due, to, the, antenna, s, resistance, to, radiating, as, well, as, any, conventional, electrical, losses, from, producing, heat, recall, that, a, current, will, reflect, when, there, are, changes, in, the, electrical, properties, of, the, material, in, order, to, efficiently, transfer, the, received, signal, into, the, transmission, line, it, is, important, that, the, transmission, line, has, the, same, impedance, as, its, connection, point, on, the, antenna, otherwise, some, of, the, signal, will, be, reflected, backwards, into, the, body, of, the, antenna, likewise, part, of, the, transmitter, s, signal, power, will, be, reflected, back, to, transmitter, if, there, is, a, change, in, electrical, impedance, where, the, feedline, joins, the, antenna, this, leads, to, the, concept, of, impedance, matching, the, design, of, the, overall, system, of, antenna, and, transmission, line, so, the, impedance, is, as, close, as, possible, thereby, reducing, these, losses, impedance, matching, is, accomplished, by, a, circuit, called, an, antenna, tuner, or, impedance, matching, network, between, the, transmitter, and, antenna, the, impedance, match, between, the, feedline, and, antenna, is, measured, by, a, parameter, called, the, standing, wave, ratio, swr, on, the, feedline, consider, a, half, wave, dipole, designed, to, work, with, signals, with, wavelength, 1, m, meaning, the, antenna, would, be, approximately, 50, cm, from, tip, to, tip, if, the, element, has, a, length, to, diameter, ratio, of, 1000, it, will, have, an, inherent, impedance, of, about, 63, ohms, resistive, using, the, appropriate, transmission, wire, or, balun, we, match, that, resistance, to, ensure, minimum, signal, reflection, feeding, that, antenna, with, a, current, of, 1, ampere, will, require, 63, volts, and, the, antenna, will, radiate, 63, watts, ignoring, losses, of, radio, frequency, power, now, consider, the, case, when, the, antenna, is, fed, a, signal, with, a, wavelength, of, 1, 25, m, in, this, case, the, current, induced, by, the, signal, would, arrive, at, the, antenna, s, feedpoint, out, of, phase, with, the, signal, causing, the, net, current, to, drop, while, the, voltage, remains, the, same, electrically, this, appears, to, be, a, very, high, impedance, the, antenna, and, transmission, line, no, longer, have, the, same, impedance, and, the, signal, will, be, reflected, back, into, the, antenna, reducing, output, this, could, be, addressed, by, changing, the, matching, system, between, the, antenna, and, transmission, line, but, that, solution, only, works, well, at, the, new, design, frequency, the, result, is, that, the, resonant, antenna, will, efficiently, feed, a, signal, into, the, transmission, line, only, when, the, source, signal, s, frequency, is, close, to, that, of, the, design, frequency, of, the, antenna, or, one, of, the, resonant, multiples, this, makes, resonant, antenna, designs, inherently, narrow, band, only, useful, for, a, small, range, of, frequencies, centered, around, the, resonance, s, it, is, possible, to, use, simple, impedance, matching, techniques, to, allow, the, use, of, monopole, or, dipole, antennas, substantially, shorter, than, the, 1, 4, or, 1, 2, wave, respectively, at, which, they, are, resonant, as, these, antennas, are, made, shorter, for, a, given, frequency, their, impedance, becomes, dominated, by, a, series, capacitive, negative, reactance, by, adding, an, appropriate, size, loading, coil, a, series, inductance, with, equal, and, opposite, positive, reactance, the, antenna, s, capacitive, reactance, may, be, cancelled, leaving, only, a, pure, resistance, sometimes, the, resulting, lower, electrical, resonant, frequency, of, such, a, system, antenna, plus, matching, network, is, described, using, the, concept, of, electrical, length, so, an, antenna, used, at, a, lower, frequency, than, its, resonant, frequency, is, called, an, electrically, short, antenna, for, example, at, 30, mhz, 10, m, wavelength, a, true, resonant, 1, 4, wave, monopole, would, be, almost, 2, 5, meters, long, and, using, an, antenna, only, 1, 5, meters, tall, would, require, the, addition, of, a, loading, coil, then, it, may, be, said, that, the, coil, has, lengthened, the, antenna, to, achieve, an, electrical, length, of, 2, 5, meters, however, the, resulting, resistive, impedance, achieved, will, be, quite, a, bit, lower, than, that, of, a, true, 1, 4, wave, resonant, monopole, often, requiring, further, impedance, matching, a, transformer, to, the, desired, transmission, line, for, ever, shorter, antennas, requiring, greater, electrical, lengthening, the, radiation, resistance, plummets, approximately, according, to, the, square, of, the, antenna, length, so, that, the, mismatch, due, to, a, net, reactance, away, from, the, electrical, resonance, worsens, or, one, could, as, well, say, that, the, equivalent, resonant, circuit, of, the, antenna, system, has, a, higher, q, factor, and, thus, a, reduced, bandwidth, which, can, even, become, inadequate, for, the, transmitted, signal, s, spectrum, resistive, losses, due, to, the, loading, coil, relative, to, the, decreased, radiation, resistance, entail, a, reduced, electrical, efficiency, which, can, be, of, great, concern, for, a, transmitting, antenna, but, bandwidth, is, the, major, factor, that, sets, the, size, of, antennas, at, 1, mhz, and, lower, frequencies, the, radiant, flux, as, a, function, of, the, distance, from, the, transmitting, antenna, varies, according, to, the, inverse, square, law, since, that, describes, the, geometrical, divergence, of, the, transmitted, wave, for, a, given, incoming, flux, the, power, acquired, by, a, receiving, antenna, is, proportional, to, its, effective, area, this, parameter, compares, the, amount, of, power, captured, by, a, receiving, antenna, in, comparison, to, the, flux, of, an, incoming, wave, measured, in, terms, of, the, signal, s, power, density, in, watts, per, square, metre, a, half, wave, dipole, has, an, effective, area, of, about, 0, 13, 2, seen, from, the, broadside, direction, if, higher, gain, is, needed, one, cannot, simply, make, the, antenna, larger, due, to, the, constraint, on, the, effective, area, of, a, receiving, antenna, detailed, below, one, sees, that, for, an, already, efficient, antenna, design, the, only, way, to, increase, gain, effective, area, is, by, reducing, the, antenna, s, gain, in, another, direction, if, a, half, wave, dipole, is, not, connected, to, an, external, circuit, but, rather, shorted, out, at, the, feedpoint, then, it, becomes, a, resonant, half, wave, element, which, efficiently, produces, a, standing, wave, in, response, to, an, impinging, radio, wave, because, there, is, no, load, to, absorb, that, power, it, retransmits, all, of, that, power, possibly, with, a, phase, shift, which, is, critically, dependent, on, the, element, s, exact, length, thus, such, a, conductor, can, be, arranged, in, order, to, transmit, a, second, copy, of, a, transmitter, s, signal, in, order, to, affect, the, radiation, pattern, and, feedpoint, impedance, of, the, element, electrically, connected, to, the, transmitter, antenna, elements, used, in, this, way, are, known, as, passive, radiators, a, yagi, uda, array, uses, passive, elements, to, greatly, increase, gain, in, one, direction, at, the, expense, of, other, directions, a, number, of, parallel, approximately, half, wave, elements, of, very, specific, lengths, are, situated, parallel, to, each, other, at, specific, positions, along, a, boom, the, boom, is, only, for, support, and, not, involved, electrically, only, one, of, the, elements, is, electrically, connected, to, the, transmitter, or, receiver, while, the, remaining, elements, are, passive, the, yagi, produces, a, fairly, large, gain, depending, on, the, number, of, passive, elements, and, is, widely, used, as, a, directional, antenna, with, an, antenna, rotor, to, control, the, direction, of, its, beam, it, suffers, from, having, a, rather, limited, bandwidth, restricting, its, use, to, certain, applications, rather, than, using, one, driven, antenna, element, along, with, passive, radiators, one, can, build, an, array, antenna, in, which, multiple, elements, are, all, driven, by, the, transmitter, through, a, system, of, power, splitters, and, transmission, lines, in, relative, phases, so, as, to, concentrate, the, rf, power, in, a, single, direction, what, s, more, a, phased, array, can, be, made, steerable, that, is, by, changing, the, phases, applied, to, each, element, the, radiation, pattern, can, be, shifted, without, physically, moving, the, antenna, elements, another, common, array, antenna, is, the, log, periodic, dipole, array, which, has, an, appearance, similar, to, the, yagi, with, a, number, of, parallel, elements, along, a, boom, but, is, totally, dissimilar, in, operation, as, all, elements, are, connected, electrically, to, the, adjacent, element, with, a, phase, reversal, using, the, log, periodic, principle, it, obtains, the, unique, property, of, maintaining, its, performance, characteristics, gain, and, impedance, over, a, very, large, bandwidth, when, a, radio, wave, hits, a, large, conducting, sheet, it, is, reflected, with, the, phase, of, the, electric, field, reversed, just, as, a, mirror, reflects, light, placing, such, a, reflector, behind, an, otherwise, non, directional, antenna, will, insure, that, the, power, that, would, have, gone, in, its, direction, is, redirected, toward, the, desired, direction, increasing, the, antenna, s, gain, by, a, factor, of, at, least, 2, likewise, a, corner, reflector, can, insure, that, all, of, the, antenna, s, power, is, concentrated, in, only, one, quadrant, of, space, or, less, with, a, consequent, increase, in, gain, practically, speaking, the, reflector, need, not, be, a, solid, metal, sheet, but, can, consist, of, a, curtain, of, rods, aligned, with, the, antenna, s, polarization, this, greatly, reduces, the, reflector, s, weight, and, wind, load, specular, reflection, of, radio, waves, is, also, employed, in, a, parabolic, reflector, antenna, in, which, a, curved, reflecting, surface, effects, focussing, of, an, incoming, wave, toward, a, so, called, feed, antenna, this, results, in, an, antenna, system, with, an, effective, area, comparable, to, the, size, of, the, reflector, itself, other, concepts, from, geometrical, optics, are, also, employed, in, antenna, technology, such, as, with, the, lens, antenna, the, antenna, s, power, gain, or, simply, gain, also, takes, into, account, the, antenna, s, efficiency, and, is, often, the, primary, figure, of, merit, antennas, are, characterized, by, a, number, of, performance, measures, which, a, user, would, be, concerned, with, in, selecting, or, designing, an, antenna, for, a, particular, application, a, plot, of, the, directional, characteristics, in, the, space, surrounding, the, antenna, is, its, radiation, pattern, the, frequency, range, or, bandwidth, over, which, an, antenna, functions, well, can, be, very, wide, as, in, a, log, periodic, antenna, or, narrow, as, in, a, small, loop, antenna, outside, this, range, the, antenna, impedance, becomes, a, poor, match, to, the, transmission, line, and, transmitter, or, receiver, use, of, the, antenna, well, away, from, its, design, frequency, affects, its, radiation, pattern, reducing, its, directive, gain, generally, an, antenna, will, not, have, a, feed, point, impedance, that, matches, that, of, a, transmission, line, a, matching, network, between, antenna, terminals, and, the, transmission, line, will, improve, power, transfer, to, the, antenna, a, non, adjustable, matching, network, will, most, likely, place, further, limits, the, usable, bandwidth, of, the, antenna, system, it, may, be, desirable, to, use, tubular, elements, instead, of, thin, wires, to, make, an, antenna, these, will, allow, a, greater, bandwidth, or, several, thin, wires, can, be, grouped, in, a, cage, to, simulate, a, thicker, element, this, widens, the, bandwidth, of, the, resonance, amateur, radio, antennas, that, operate, at, several, frequency, bands, which, are, widely, separated, from, each, other, may, connect, elements, resonant, at, those, different, frequencies, in, parallel, most, of, the, transmitter, s, power, will, flow, into, the, resonant, element, while, the, others, present, a, high, impedance, another, solution, uses, traps, parallel, resonant, circuits, which, are, strategically, placed, in, breaks, created, in, long, antenna, elements, when, used, at, the, trap, s, particular, resonant, frequency, the, trap, presents, a, very, high, impedance, parallel, resonance, effectively, truncating, the, element, at, the, location, of, the, trap, if, positioned, correctly, the, truncated, element, makes, a, proper, resonant, antenna, at, the, trap, frequency, at, substantially, higher, or, lower, frequencies, the, trap, allows, the, full, length, of, the, broken, element, to, be, employed, but, with, a, resonant, frequency, shifted, by, the, net, reactance, added, by, the, trap, the, bandwidth, characteristics, of, a, resonant, antenna, element, can, be, characterized, according, to, its, q, where, the, resistance, involved, is, the, radiation, resistance, which, represents, the, emission, of, energy, from, the, resonant, antenna, to, free, space, the, q, of, a, narrow, band, antenna, can, be, as, high, as, 15, on, the, other, hand, the, reactance, at, the, same, off, resonant, frequency, of, one, using, thick, elements, is, much, less, consequently, resulting, in, a, q, as, low, as, 5, these, two, antennas, may, perform, equivalently, at, the, resonant, frequency, but, the, second, antenna, will, perform, over, a, bandwidth, 3, times, as, wide, as, the, antenna, consisting, of, a, thin, conductor, antennas, for, use, over, much, broader, frequency, ranges, are, achieved, using, further, techniques, adjustment, of, a, matching, network, can, in, principle, allow, for, any, antenna, to, be, matched, at, any, frequency, thus, the, small, loop, antenna, built, into, most, am, broadcast, medium, wave, receivers, has, a, very, narrow, bandwidth, but, is, tuned, using, a, parallel, capacitance, which, is, adjusted, according, to, the, receiver, tuning, on, the, other, hand, log, periodic, antennas, are, not, resonant, at, any, single, frequency, but, can, in, principle, be, built, to, attain, similar, characteristics, including, feedpoint, impedance, over, any, frequency, range, these, are, therefore, commonly, used, in, the, form, of, directional, log, periodic, dipole, arrays, as, television, antennas, gain, is, a, parameter, which, measures, the, degree, of, directivity, of, the, antenna, s, radiation, pattern, a, high, gain, antenna, will, radiate, most, of, its, power, in, a, particular, direction, while, a, low, gain, antenna, will, radiate, over, a, wide, angle, the, antenna, gain, or, power, gain, of, an, antenna, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, intensity, power, per, unit, surface, area, i, displaystyle, i, radiated, by, the, antenna, in, the, direction, of, its, maximum, output, at, an, arbitrary, distance, divided, by, the, intensity, i, iso, displaystyle, i, text, iso, radiated, at, the, same, distance, by, a, hypothetical, isotropic, antenna, which, radiates, equal, power, in, all, directions, this, dimensionless, ratio, is, usually, expressed, logarithmically, in, decibels, these, units, are, called, decibels, isotropic, dbi, a, second, unit, used, to, measure, gain, is, the, ratio, of, the, power, radiated, by, the, antenna, to, the, power, radiated, by, a, half, wave, dipole, antenna, i, dipole, displaystyle, i, text, dipole, these, units, are, called, decibels, dipole, dbd, since, the, gain, of, a, half, wave, dipole, is, 2, 15, dbi, and, the, logarithm, of, a, product, is, additive, the, gain, in, dbi, is, just, 2, 15, decibels, greater, than, the, gain, in, dbd, high, gain, antennas, have, the, advantage, of, longer, range, and, better, signal, quality, but, must, be, aimed, carefully, at, the, other, antenna, an, example, of, a, high, gain, antenna, is, a, parabolic, dish, such, as, a, satellite, television, antenna, low, gain, antennas, have, shorter, range, but, the, orientation, of, the, antenna, is, relatively, unimportant, an, example, of, a, low, gain, antenna, is, the, whip, antenna, found, on, portable, radios, and, cordless, phones, antenna, gain, should, not, be, confused, with, amplifier, gain, a, separate, parameter, measuring, the, increase, in, signal, power, due, to, an, amplifying, device, placed, at, the, front, end, of, the, system, such, as, a, low, noise, amplifier, the, effective, area, or, effective, aperture, of, a, receiving, antenna, expresses, the, portion, of, the, power, of, a, passing, electromagnetic, wave, which, the, antenna, delivers, to, its, terminals, expressed, in, terms, of, an, equivalent, area, for, instance, if, a, radio, wave, passing, a, given, location, has, a, flux, of, 1, pw, m, 2, 10, 12, watts, per, square, meter, and, an, antenna, has, an, effective, area, of, 12, m, 2, then, the, antenna, would, deliver, 12, pw, of, rf, power, to, the, receiver, 30, microvolts, rms, at, 75, ohms, since, the, receiving, antenna, is, not, equally, sensitive, to, signals, received, from, all, directions, the, effective, area, is, a, function, of, the, direction, to, the, source, due, to, reciprocity, discussed, above, the, gain, of, an, antenna, used, for, transmitting, must, be, proportional, to, its, effective, area, when, used, for, receiving, consider, an, antenna, with, no, loss, that, is, one, whose, electrical, efficiency, is, 100, it, can, be, shown, that, its, effective, area, averaged, over, all, directions, must, be, equal, to, 2, 4, the, wavelength, squared, divided, by, 4, gain, is, defined, such, that, the, average, gain, over, all, directions, for, an, antenna, with, 100, electrical, efficiency, is, equal, to, 1, therefore, the, effective, area, a, eff, in, terms, of, the, gain, g, in, a, given, direction, is, given, by, for, an, antenna, with, an, efficiency, of, less, than, 100, both, the, effective, area, and, gain, are, reduced, by, that, same, amount, therefore, the, above, relationship, between, gain, and, effective, area, still, holds, these, are, thus, two, different, ways, of, expressing, the, same, quantity, a, eff, is, especially, convenient, when, computing, the, power, that, would, be, received, by, an, antenna, of, a, specified, gain, as, illustrated, by, the, above, example, the, radiation, pattern, of, an, antenna, is, a, plot, of, the, relative, field, strength, of, the, radio, waves, emitted, by, the, antenna, at, different, angles, in, the, far, field, it, is, typically, represented, by, a, three, dimensional, graph, or, polar, plots, of, the, horizontal, and, vertical, cross, sections, the, pattern, of, an, ideal, isotropic, antenna, which, radiates, equally, in, all, directions, would, look, like, a, sphere, many, nondirectional, antennas, such, as, monopoles, and, dipoles, emit, equal, power, in, all, horizontal, directions, with, the, power, dropping, off, at, higher, and, lower, angles, this, is, called, an, omnidirectional, pattern, and, when, plotted, looks, like, a, torus, or, donut, the, radiation, of, many, antennas, shows, a, pattern, of, maxima, or, lobes, at, various, angles, separated, by, nulls, angles, where, the, radiation, falls, to, zero, this, is, because, the, radio, waves, emitted, by, different, parts, of, the, antenna, typically, interfere, causing, maxima, at, angles, where, the, radio, waves, arrive, at, distant, points, in, phase, and, zero, radiation, at, other, angles, where, the, radio, waves, arrive, out, of, phase, in, a, directional, antenna, designed, to, project, radio, waves, in, a, particular, direction, the, lobe, in, that, direction, is, designed, larger, than, the, others, and, is, called, the, main, lobe, the, other, lobes, usually, represent, unwanted, radiation, and, are, called, sidelobes, the, axis, through, the, main, lobe, is, called, the, principal, axis, or, boresight, axis, the, polar, diagrams, and, therefore, the, efficiency, and, gain, of, yagi, antennas, are, tighter, if, the, antenna, is, tuned, for, a, narrower, frequency, range, e, g, the, grouped, antenna, compared, to, the, wideband, similarly, the, polar, plots, of, horizontally, polarized, yagis, are, tighter, than, for, those, vertically, polarized, the, space, surrounding, an, antenna, can, be, divided, into, three, concentric, regions, the, reactive, near, field, also, called, the, inductive, near, field, the, radiating, near, field, fresnel, region, and, the, far, field, fraunhofer, regions, these, regions, are, useful, to, identify, the, field, structure, in, each, although, the, transitions, between, them, are, gradual, there, are, no, clear, boundaries, the, far, field, region, is, far, enough, from, the, antenna, to, ignore, its, size, and, shape, it, can, be, assumed, that, the, electromagnetic, wave, is, purely, a, radiating, plane, wave, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, in, phase, and, perpendicular, to, each, other, and, to, the, direction, of, propagation, this, simplifies, the, mathematical, analysis, of, the, radiated, field, efficiency, of, a, transmitting, antenna, is, the, ratio, of, power, actually, radiated, in, all, directions, to, the, power, absorbed, by, the, antenna, terminals, the, power, supplied, to, the, antenna, terminals, which, is, not, radiated, is, converted, into, heat, this, is, usually, through, loss, resistance, in, the, antenna, s, conductors, or, loss, between, the, reflector, and, feed, horn, of, a, parabolic, antenna, antenna, efficiency, is, separate, from, impedance, matching, which, may, also, reduce, the, amount, of, power, radiated, using, a, given, transmitter, if, an, swr, meter, reads, 150, w, of, incident, power, and, 50, w, of, reflected, power, that, means, 100, w, have, actually, been, absorbed, by, the, antenna, ignoring, transmission, line, losses, how, much, of, that, power, has, actually, been, radiated, cannot, be, directly, determined, through, electrical, measurements, at, or, before, the, antenna, terminals, but, would, require, for, instance, careful, measurement, of, field, strength, the, loss, resistance, and, efficiency, of, an, antenna, can, be, calculated, once, the, field, strength, is, known, by, comparing, it, to, the, power, supplied, to, the, antenna, the, loss, resistance, will, generally, affect, the, feedpoint, impedance, adding, to, its, resistive, component, that, resistance, will, consist, of, the, sum, of, the, radiation, resistance, r, rad, and, the, loss, resistance, r, loss, if, a, current, i, is, delivered, to, the, terminals, of, an, antenna, then, a, power, of, i, 2, r, rad, will, be, radiated, and, a, power, of, i, 2, r, loss, will, be, lost, as, heat, therefore, the, efficiency, of, an, antenna, is, equal, to, r, rad, r, rad, r, loss, only, the, total, resistance, r, rad, r, loss, can, be, directly, measured, according, to, reciprocity, the, efficiency, of, an, antenna, used, as, a, receiving, antenna, is, identical, to, its, efficiency, as, a, transmitting, antenna, described, above, the, power, that, an, antenna, will, deliver, to, a, receiver, with, a, proper, impedance, match, is, reduced, by, the, same, amount, in, some, receiving, applications, the, very, inefficient, antennas, may, have, little, impact, on, performance, at, low, frequencies, for, example, atmospheric, or, man, made, noise, can, mask, antenna, inefficiency, for, example, ccir, rep, 258, 3, indicates, man, made, noise, in, a, residential, setting, at, 40, mhz, is, about, 28, db, above, the, thermal, noise, floor, consequently, an, antenna, with, a, 20, db, loss, due, to, inefficiency, would, have, little, impact, on, system, noise, performance, the, loss, within, the, antenna, will, affect, the, intended, signal, and, the, noise, interference, identically, leading, to, no, reduction, in, signal, to, noise, ratio, snr, antennas, which, are, not, a, significant, fraction, of, a, wavelength, in, size, are, inevitably, inefficient, due, to, their, small, radiation, resistance, am, broadcast, radios, include, a, small, loop, antenna, for, reception, which, has, an, extremely, poor, efficiency, this, has, little, effect, on, the, receiver, s, performance, but, simply, requires, greater, amplification, by, the, receiver, s, electronics, contrast, this, tiny, component, to, the, massive, and, very, tall, towers, used, at, am, broadcast, stations, for, transmitting, at, the, very, same, frequency, where, every, percentage, point, of, reduced, antenna, efficiency, entails, a, substantial, cost, the, definition, of, antenna, gain, or, power, gain, already, includes, the, effect, of, the, antenna, s, efficiency, therefore, if, one, is, trying, to, radiate, a, signal, toward, a, receiver, using, a, transmitter, of, a, given, power, one, need, only, compare, the, gain, of, various, antennas, rather, than, considering, the, efficiency, as, well, this, is, likewise, true, for, a, receiving, antenna, at, very, high, especially, microwave, frequencies, where, the, point, is, to, receive, a, signal, which, is, strong, compared, to, the, receiver, s, noise, temperature, however, in, the, case, of, a, directional, antenna, used, for, receiving, signals, with, the, intention, of, rejecting, interference, from, different, directions, one, is, no, longer, concerned, with, the, antenna, efficiency, as, discussed, above, in, this, case, rather, than, quoting, the, antenna, gain, one, would, be, more, concerned, with, the, directive, gain, or, simply, directivity, which, does, not, include, the, effect, of, antenna, in, efficiency, the, directive, gain, of, an, antenna, can, be, computed, from, the, published, gain, divided, by, the, antenna, s, efficiency, in, equation, form, gain, directivity, efficiency, the, orientation, and, physical, structure, of, an, antenna, determine, the, polarization, of, the, electric, field, of, the, radio, wave, transmitted, by, it, for, instance, an, antenna, composed, of, a, linear, conductor, such, as, a, dipole, or, whip, antenna, oriented, vertically, will, result, in, vertical, polarization, if, turned, on, its, side, the, same, antenna, s, polarization, will, be, horizontal, reflections, generally, affect, polarization, radio, waves, reflected, off, the, ionosphere, can, change, the, wave, s, polarization, for, line, of, sight, communications, or, ground, wave, propagation, horizontally, or, vertically, polarized, transmissions, generally, remain, in, about, the, same, polarization, state, at, the, receiving, location, using, a, vertically, polarized, antenna, to, receive, a, horizontally, polarized, wave, or, visa, versa, results, in, relatively, poor, reception, an, antenna, s, polarization, can, sometimes, be, inferred, directly, from, its, geometry, when, the, antenna, s, conductors, viewed, from, a, reference, location, appear, along, one, line, then, the, antenna, s, polarization, will, be, linear, in, that, very, direction, in, the, more, general, case, the, antenna, s, polarization, must, be, determined, through, analysis, for, instance, a, turnstile, antenna, mounted, horizontally, as, is, usual, from, a, distant, location, on, earth, appears, as, a, horizontal, line, segment, so, its, radiation, received, there, is, horizontally, polarized, but, viewed, at, a, downward, angle, from, an, airplane, the, same, antenna, does, not, meet, this, requirement, in, fact, its, radiation, is, elliptically, polarized, when, viewed, from, that, direction, in, some, antennas, the, state, of, polarization, will, change, with, the, frequency, of, transmission, the, polarization, of, a, commercial, antenna, is, an, essential, specification, in, the, most, general, case, polarization, is, elliptical, meaning, that, over, each, cycle, the, electric, field, vector, traces, out, an, ellipse, two, special, cases, are, linear, polarization, the, ellipse, collapses, into, a, line, as, discussed, above, and, circular, polarization, in, which, the, two, axes, of, the, ellipse, are, equal, in, linear, polarization, the, electric, field, of, the, radio, wave, oscillates, along, one, direction, in, circular, polarization, the, electric, field, of, the, radio, wave, rotates, around, the, axis, of, propagation, circular, or, elliptically, polarized, radio, waves, are, designated, as, right, handed, or, left, handed, using, the, thumb, in, the, direction, of, the, propagation, rule, note, that, for, circular, polarization, optical, researchers, use, the, opposite, right, hand, rule, from, the, one, used, by, radio, engineers, it, is, best, for, the, receiving, antenna, to, match, the, polarization, of, the, transmitted, wave, for, optimum, reception, otherwise, there, will, be, a, loss, of, signal, strength, when, a, linearly, polarized, antenna, receives, linearly, polarized, radiation, at, a, relative, angle, of, then, there, will, be, a, power, loss, of, cos, 2, a, circularly, polarized, antenna, can, be, used, to, equally, well, match, vertical, or, horizontal, linear, polarizations, suffering, a, 3, db, signal, reduction, however, it, will, be, blind, to, a, circularly, polarized, signal, of, the, opposite, orientation, maximum, power, transfer, requires, matching, the, impedance, of, an, antenna, system, as, seen, looking, into, the, transmission, line, to, the, complex, conjugate, of, the, impedance, of, the, receiver, or, transmitter, in, the, case, of, a, transmitter, however, the, desired, matching, impedance, might, not, exactly, correspond, to, the, dynamic, output, impedance, of, the, transmitter, as, analyzed, as, a, source, impedance, but, rather, the, design, value, typically, 50, ohms, required, for, efficient, and, safe, operation, of, the, transmitting, circuitry, the, intended, impedance, is, normally, resistive, but, a, transmitter, and, some, receivers, may, have, limited, additional, adjustments, to, cancel, a, certain, amount, of, reactance, in, order, to, tweak, the, match, when, a, transmission, line, is, used, in, between, the, antenna, and, the, transmitter, or, receiver, one, generally, would, like, an, antenna, system, whose, impedance, is, resistive, and, nearly, the, same, as, the, characteristic, impedance, of, that, transmission, line, in, addition, to, matching, the, impedance, that, the, transmitter, or, receiver, expects, the, match, is, sought, to, minimize, the, amplitude, of, standing, waves, measured, via, the, standing, wave, ratio, swr, that, a, mismatch, raises, on, the, line, and, the, increase, in, transmission, line, losses, it, entails, antenna, tuning, in, the, strict, sense, of, modifying, the, antenna, itself, generally, refers, only, to, cancellation, of, any, reactance, seen, at, the, antenna, terminals, leaving, only, a, resistive, impedance, which, might, or, might, not, be, exactly, the, desired, impedance, that, of, the, available, transmission, line, although, an, antenna, may, be, designed, to, have, a, purely, resistive, feedpoint, impedance, such, as, a, dipole, 97, of, a, half, wavelength, long, at, just, one, frequency, this, will, very, likely, not, be, exactly, true, at, other, frequencies, that, the, antenna, is, eventually, used, for, in, most, cases, in, principle, the, physical, length, of, the, antenna, can, be, trimmed, to, obtain, a, pure, resistance, although, this, is, rarely, convenient, on, the, other, hand, the, addition, of, a, contrary, inductance, or, capacitance, can, be, used, to, cancel, a, residual, capacitive, or, inductive, reactance, respectively, and, may, be, more, convenient, than, lowering, and, trimming, or, extending, the, antenna, then, hoisting, it, back, antenna, reactance, may, be, removed, using, lumped, elements, such, as, capacitors, or, inductors, in, the, main, path, of, current, traversing, the, antenna, often, near, the, feedpoint, or, by, incorporating, capacitive, or, inductive, structures, into, the, conducting, body, of, the, antenna, to, cancel, the, feedpoint, reactance, such, as, open, ended, spoke, radial, wires, or, looped, parallel, wires, hence, genuinely, tune, the, antenna, to, resonance, in, addition, to, those, reactance, neutralizing, add, ons, antennas, of, any, kind, may, include, a, transformer, and, or, transformer, balun, at, their, feedpoint, to, change, the, resistive, part, of, the, impedance, to, more, nearly, match, the, feedline, s, characteristic, impedance, antenna, tuning, in, the, loose, sense, performed, by, an, impedance, matching, device, somewhat, inappropriately, named, an, antenna, tuner, or, the, older, more, appropriate, term, transmatch, goes, beyond, merely, removing, reactance, and, includes, transforming, the, remaining, resistance, to, match, the, feedline, and, radio, an, additional, problem, is, matching, the, remaining, resistive, impedance, to, the, characteristic, impedance, of, the, transmission, line, a, general, impedance, matching, network, an, antenna, tuner, or, atu, will, have, at, least, two, adjustable, elements, to, correct, both, components, of, impedance, any, matching, network, will, have, both, power, losses, and, power, restrictions, when, used, for, transmitting, commercial, antennas, are, generally, designed, to, approximately, match, standard, 50, ohm, coaxial, cables, at, standard, frequencies, the, design, expectation, is, that, a, matching, network, will, be, merely, used, to, tweak, any, residual, mismatch, in, some, cases, matching, is, done, in, a, more, extreme, manner, not, simply, to, cancel, a, small, amount, of, residual, reactance, but, to, resonate, an, antenna, whose, resonance, frequency, is, quite, different, from, the, intended, frequency, of, operation, ground, reflections, is, one, of, the, common, types, of, multipath, the, radiation, pattern, and, even, the, driving, point, impedance, of, an, antenna, can, be, influenced, by, the, dielectric, constant, and, especially, conductivity, of, nearby, objects, for, a, terrestrial, antenna, the, ground, is, usually, one, such, object, of, importance, the, antenna, s, height, above, the, ground, as, well, as, the, electrical, properties, permittivity, and, conductivity, of, the, ground, can, then, be, important, also, in, the, particular, case, of, a, monopole, antenna, the, ground, or, an, artificial, ground, plane, serves, as, the, return, connection, for, the, antenna, current, thus, having, an, additional, effect, particularly, on, the, impedance, seen, by, the, feed, line, when, an, electromagnetic, wave, strikes, a, plane, surface, such, as, the, ground, part, of, the, wave, is, transmitted, into, the, ground, and, part, of, it, is, reflected, according, to, the, fresnel, coefficients, if, the, ground, is, a, very, good, conductor, then, almost, all, of, the, wave, is, reflected, 180, out, of, phase, whereas, a, ground, modeled, as, a, lossy, dielectric, can, absorb, a, large, amount, of, the, wave, s, power, the, power, remaining, in, the, reflected, wave, and, the, phase, shift, upon, reflection, strongly, depend, on, the, wave, s, angle, of, incidence, and, polarization, the, dielectric, constant, and, conductivity, or, simply, the, complex, dielectric, constant, is, dependent, on, the, soil, type, and, is, a, function, of, frequency, for, very, low, frequencies, to, high, frequencies, 30, mhz, the, ground, behaves, as, a, lossy, dielectric, thus, the, ground, is, characterized, both, by, a, conductivity, and, permittivity, dielectric, constant, which, can, be, measured, for, a, given, soil, but, is, influenced, by, fluctuating, moisture, levels, or, can, be, estimated, from, certain, maps, at, lower, mediumwave, frequencies, the, ground, acts, mainly, as, a, good, conductor, which, am, broadcast, 0, 5, 1, 7, mhz, antennas, depend, on, at, frequencies, between, 3, 30, mhz, a, large, portion, of, the, energy, from, a, horizontally, polarized, antenna, reflects, off, the, ground, with, almost, total, reflection, at, the, grazing, angles, important, for, ground, wave, propagation, that, reflected, wave, with, its, phase, reversed, can, either, cancel, or, reinforce, the, direct, wave, depending, on, the, antenna, height, in, wavelengths, and, elevation, angle, for, a, sky, wave, on, the, other, hand, vertically, polarized, radiation, is, not, well, reflected, by, the, ground, except, at, grazing, incidence, or, over, very, highly, conducting, surfaces, such, as, sea, water, however, the, grazing, angle, reflection, important, for, ground, wave, propagation, using, vertical, polarization, is, in, phase, with, the, direct, wave, providing, a, boost, of, up, to, 6, db, as, is, detailed, below, at, vhf, and, above, 30, mhz, the, ground, becomes, a, poorer, reflector, however, for, shortwave, frequencies, especially, below, 15, mhz, it, remains, a, good, reflector, especially, for, horizontal, polarization, and, grazing, angles, of, incidence, that, is, important, as, these, higher, frequencies, usually, depend, on, horizontal, line, of, sight, propagation, except, for, satellite, communications, the, ground, then, behaving, almost, as, a, mirror, the, net, quality, of, a, ground, reflection, depends, on, the, topography, of, the, surface, when, the, irregularities, of, the, surface, are, much, smaller, than, the, wavelength, the, dominant, regime, is, that, of, specular, reflection, and, the, receiver, sees, both, the, real, antenna, and, an, image, of, the, antenna, under, the, ground, due, to, reflection, but, if, the, ground, has, irregularities, not, small, compared, to, the, wavelength, reflections, will, not, be, coherent, but, shifted, by, random, phases, with, shorter, wavelengths, higher, frequencies, this, is, generally, the, case, whenever, both, the, receiving, or, transmitting, antenna, are, placed, at, significant, heights, above, the, ground, relative, to, the, wavelength, waves, reflected, specularly, by, the, ground, will, travel, a, longer, distance, than, direct, waves, inducing, a, phase, shift, which, can, sometimes, be, significant, when, a, sky, wave, is, launched, by, such, an, antenna, that, phase, shift, is, always, significant, unless, the, antenna, is, very, close, to, the, ground, compared, to, the, wavelength, the, phase, of, reflection, of, electromagnetic, waves, depends, on, the, polarization, of, the, incident, wave, given, the, larger, refractive, index, of, the, ground, typically, n, 2, compared, to, air, n, 1, the, phase, of, horizontally, polarized, radiation, is, reversed, upon, reflection, a, phase, shift, of, radians, or, 180, on, the, other, hand, the, vertical, component, of, the, wave, s, electric, field, is, reflected, at, grazing, angles, of, incidence, approximately, in, phase, these, phase, shifts, apply, as, well, to, a, ground, modeled, as, a, good, electrical, conductor, this, means, that, a, receiving, antenna, sees, an, image, of, the, emitting, antenna, but, with, reversed, currents, opposite, in, direction, and, phase, if, the, emitting, antenna, is, horizontally, oriented, and, thus, horizontally, polarized, however, the, received, current, will, be, in, the, same, absolute, direction, and, phase, if, the, emitting, antenna, is, vertically, polarized, the, actual, antenna, which, is, transmitting, the, original, wave, then, also, may, receive, a, strong, signal, from, its, own, image, from, the, ground, this, will, induce, an, additional, current, in, the, antenna, element, changing, the, current, at, the, feedpoint, for, a, given, feedpoint, voltage, thus, the, antenna, s, impedance, given, by, the, ratio, of, feedpoint, voltage, to, current, is, altered, due, to, the, antenna, s, proximity, to, the, ground, this, can, be, quite, a, significant, effect, when, the, antenna, is, within, a, wavelength, or, two, of, the, ground, but, as, the, antenna, height, is, increased, the, reduced, power, of, the, reflected, wave, due, to, the, inverse, square, law, allows, the, antenna, to, approach, its, asymptotic, feedpoint, impedance, given, by, theory, at, lower, heights, the, effect, on, the, antenna, s, impedance, is, very, sensitive, to, the, exact, distance, from, the, ground, as, this, affects, the, phase, of, the, reflected, wave, relative, to, the, currents, in, the, antenna, changing, the, antenna, s, height, by, a, quarter, wavelength, then, changes, the, phase, of, the, reflection, by, 180, with, a, completely, different, effect, on, the, antenna, s, impedance, the, ground, reflection, has, an, important, effect, on, the, net, far, field, radiation, pattern, in, the, vertical, plane, that, is, as, a, function, of, elevation, angle, which, is, thus, different, between, a, vertically, and, horizontally, polarized, antenna, consider, an, antenna, at, a, height, h, above, the, ground, transmitting, a, wave, considered, at, the, elevation, angle, for, a, vertically, polarized, transmission, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, field, of, the, electromagnetic, wave, produced, by, the, direct, ray, plus, the, reflected, ray, is, thus, the, power, received, can, be, as, high, as, 4, times, that, due, to, the, direct, wave, alone, such, as, when, 0, following, the, square, of, the, cosine, the, sign, inversion, for, the, reflection, of, horizontally, polarized, emission, instead, results, in, where, for, horizontal, propagation, between, transmitting, and, receiving, antennas, situated, near, the, ground, reasonably, far, from, each, other, the, distances, traveled, by, the, direct, and, reflected, rays, are, nearly, the, same, there, is, almost, no, relative, phase, shift, if, the, emission, is, polarized, vertically, the, two, fields, direct, and, reflected, add, and, there, is, maximum, of, received, signal, if, the, signal, is, polarized, horizontally, the, two, signals, subtract, and, the, received, signal, is, largely, cancelled, the, vertical, plane, radiation, patterns, are, shown, in, the, image, at, right, with, vertical, polarization, there, is, always, a, maximum, for, 0, horizontal, propagation, left, pattern, for, horizontal, polarization, there, is, cancellation, at, that, angle, the, above, formulae, and, these, plots, assume, the, ground, as, a, perfect, conductor, these, plots, of, the, radiation, pattern, correspond, to, a, distance, between, the, antenna, and, its, image, of, 2, 5, as, the, antenna, height, is, increased, the, number, of, lobes, increases, as, well, the, difference, in, the, above, factors, for, the, case, of, 0, is, the, reason, that, most, broadcasting, transmissions, intended, for, the, public, uses, vertical, polarization, for, receivers, near, the, ground, horizontally, polarized, transmissions, suffer, cancellation, for, best, reception, the, receiving, antennas, for, these, signals, are, likewise, vertically, polarized, in, some, applications, where, the, receiving, antenna, must, work, in, any, position, as, in, mobile, phones, the, base, station, antennas, use, mixed, polarization, such, as, linear, polarization, at, an, angle, with, both, vertical, and, horizontal, components, or, circular, polarization, on, the, other, hand, analog, television, transmissions, are, usually, horizontally, polarized, because, in, urban, areas, buildings, can, reflect, the, electromagnetic, waves, and, create, ghost, images, due, to, multipath, propagation, using, horizontal, polarization, ghosting, is, reduced, because, the, amount, of, reflection, in, the, horizontal, polarization, off, the, side, of, a, building, is, generally, less, than, in, the, vertical, direction, vertically, polarized, analog, television, have, been, used, in, some, rural, areas, in, digital, terrestrial, television, such, reflections, are, less, problematic, due, to, robustness, of, binary, transmissions, and, error, correction, the, flow, of, current, in, wire, antennas, is, identical, to, the, solution, of, counter, propagating, waves, in, a, single, conductor, transmission, line, which, can, be, solved, using, the, telegrapher, s, equations, solutions, of, currents, along, antenna, elements, are, more, conveniently, and, accurately, obtained, by, numerical, methods, so, transmission, line, techniques, have, largely, been, abandoned, for, precision, modelling, but, they, continue, to, be, a, widely, used, source, of, useful, simple, approximations, that, describe, well, the, impedance, profiles, of, antennas, pp, 7, 10, p, 232, unlike, transmission, lines, currents, in, antennas, contribute, power, to, the, radiated, part, electromagnetic, field, which, can, be, modeled, using, radiation, resistance, the, end, of, an, antenna, element, corresponds, to, an, unterminated, open, end, of, a, single, conductor, transmission, line, resulting, in, a, reflected, wave, identical, to, the, incident, wave, with, its, voltage, in, phase, with, the, incident, wave, and, its, current, in, the, opposite, phase, thus, net, zero, current, where, there, is, after, all, no, further, conductor, the, combination, of, the, incident, and, reflected, wave, just, as, in, a, transmission, line, forms, a, standing, wave, with, a, current, node, at, the, conductor, s, end, and, a, voltage, node, one, quarter, wavelength, from, the, end, if, the, element, is, at, least, that, long, in, a, resonant, antenna, the, feedpoint, of, the, antenna, is, at, one, of, those, voltage, nodes, due, to, discrepancies, from, the, simplified, version, of, the, transmission, line, model, the, voltage, one, quarter, wavelength, from, the, current, node, is, not, exactly, zero, but, it, is, near, a, minimum, and, small, compared, to, the, much, large, voltage, at, the, conductor, s, end, hence, a, feed, point, matching, the, antenna, at, that, spot, requires, a, relatively, small, voltage, but, large, current, the, currents, from, the, two, waves, add, in, phase, there, thus, a, relatively, low, feedpoint, impedance, feeding, the, antenna, at, other, points, involves, a, large, voltage, thus, a, large, impedance, and, usually, one, that, is, primarily, reactive, low, power, factor, which, is, a, terrible, impedance, match, to, available, transmission, lines, therefore, it, is, usually, desired, for, an, antenna, to, operate, as, a, resonant, element, with, each, conductor, having, a, length, of, one, quarter, wavelength, or, any, other, odd, multiples, of, a, quarter, wavelength, for, instance, a, half, wave, dipole, has, two, such, elements, one, connected, to, each, conductor, of, a, balanced, transmission, line, about, one, quarter, wavelength, long, depending, on, the, conductors, diameters, a, small, deviation, from, this, length, is, adopted, in, order, to, reach, the, point, where, the, antenna, current, and, the, small, feedpoint, voltage, are, exactly, in, phase, then, the, antenna, presents, a, purely, resistive, impedance, and, ideally, one, close, to, the, characteristic, impedance, of, an, available, transmission, line, despite, these, useful, properties, resonant, antennas, have, the, disadvantage, that, they, achieve, resonance, purely, resistive, feedpoint, impedance, only, at, a, fundamental, frequency, and, perhaps, some, of, its, harmonics, and, the, feedpoint, resistance, is, larger, at, higher, order, resonances, therefore, resonant, antennas, can, only, achieve, their, good, performance, within, a, limited, bandwidth, depending, on, the, q, at, the, resonance, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, emanating, from, a, driven, antenna, element, will, generally, affect, the, voltages, and, currents, in, nearby, antennas, antenna, elements, or, other, conductors, this, is, particularly, true, when, the, affected, conductor, is, a, resonant, element, multiple, of, half, wavelengths, in, length, at, about, the, same, frequency, as, is, the, case, where, the, conductors, are, all, part, of, the, same, active, or, passive, antenna, array, because, the, affected, conductors, are, in, the, near, field, one, can, not, just, treat, two, antennas, as, transmitting, and, receiving, a, signal, according, to, the, friis, transmission, formula, for, instance, but, must, calculate, the, mutual, impedance, matrix, which, takes, into, account, both, voltages, and, currents, interactions, through, both, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, thus, using, the, mutual, impedances, calculated, for, a, specific, geometry, one, can, solve, for, the, radiation, pattern, of, a, yagi, uda, antenna, or, the, currents, and, voltages, for, each, element, of, a, phased, array, such, an, analysis, can, also, describe, in, detail, reflection, of, radio, waves, by, a, ground, plane, or, by, a, corner, reflector, and, their, effect, on, the, impedance, and, radiation, pattern, of, an, antenna, in, its, vicinity, often, such, near, field, interactions, are, undesired, and, pernicious, currents, in, random, metal, objects, near, a, transmitting, antenna, will, often, be, in, poor, conductors, causing, loss, of, rf, power, in, addition, to, unpredictably, altering, the, characteristics, of, the, antenna, by, careful, design, it, is, possible, to, reduce, the, electrical, interaction, between, nearby, conductors, for, instance, the, 90, degree, angle, in, between, the, two, dipoles, composing, the, turnstile, antenna, insures, no, interaction, between, these, allowing, these, to, be, driven, independently, but, actually, with, the, same, signal, in, quadrature, phases, in, the, turnstile, antenna, design, antennas, can, be, classified, by, operating, principles, or, by, their, application, different, authorities, placed, antennas, in, narrower, or, broader, categories, generally, these, include, these, antenna, types, and, others, are, summarized, in, greater, detail, in, the, overview, article, antenna, types, as, well, as, in, each, of, the, linked, articles, in, the, list, above, and, in, even, more, detail, in, articles, which, those, link, to, the, dictionary, definition, of, antenna, at, wiktionary
