broadcasting, is, the, distribution, of, audio, or, video, content, to, a, dispersed, audience, via, any, electronic, mass, communications, medium, but, typically, one, using, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, radio, waves, in, a, one, to, many, model, broadcasting, began, with, am, radio, which, came, into, popular, use, around, 1920, with, the, spread, of, vacuum, tube, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, before, this, most, implementations, of, electronic, communication, early, radio, telephone, and, telegraph, were, one, to, one, with, the, message, intended, for, a, single, recipient, the, term, broadcasting, evolved, from, its, use, as, the, agricultural, method, of, sowing, seeds, in, a, field, by, casting, them, broadly, about, it, was, later, adopted, for, describing, the, widespread, distribution, of, information, by, printed, materials, or, by, telegraph, examples, applying, it, to, one, to, many, radio, transmissions, of, an, individual, station, to, multiple, listeners, appeared, as, early, as, 1898, over, the, air, broadcasting, is, usually, associated, with, radio, and, television, though, more, recently, both, radio, and, television, transmissions, have, begun, to, be, distributed, by, cable, cable, television, the, receiving, parties, may, include, the, general, public, or, a, relatively, small, subset, the, point, is, that, anyone, with, the, appropriate, receiving, technology, and, equipment, e, g, a, radio, or, television, set, can, receive, the, signal, the, field, of, broadcasting, includes, both, government, managed, services, such, as, public, radio, community, radio, and, public, television, and, private, commercial, radio, and, commercial, television, the, u, s, code, of, federal, regulations, title, 47, part, 97, defines, broadcasting, as, transmissions, intended, for, reception, by, the, general, public, either, direct, or, relayed, private, or, two, way, telecommunications, transmissions, do, not, qualify, under, this, definition, for, example, amateur, ham, and, citizens, band, cb, radio, operators, are, not, allowed, to, broadcast, as, defined, transmitting, and, broadcasting, are, not, the, same, transmission, of, radio, and, television, programs, from, a, radio, or, television, station, to, home, receivers, by, radio, waves, is, referred, to, as, over, the, air, ota, or, terrestrial, broadcasting, and, in, most, countries, requires, a, broadcasting, license, transmissions, using, a, wire, or, cable, like, cable, television, which, also, retransmits, ota, stations, with, their, consent, are, also, considered, broadcasts, but, do, not, necessarily, require, a, license, though, in, some, countries, a, license, is, required, in, the, 2000s, transmissions, of, television, and, radio, programs, via, streaming, digital, technology, have, increasingly, been, referred, to, as, broadcasting, as, well, in, 1894, italian, inventor, guglielmo, marconi, began, developing, a, wireless, communication, using, the, then, newly, discovered, phenomenon, of, radio, waves, showing, by, 1901, that, they, could, be, transmitted, across, the, atlantic, ocean, this, was, the, start, of, wireless, telegraphy, by, radio, audio, radio, broadcasting, began, experimentally, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, on, 17, december, 1902, a, transmission, from, the, marconi, station, in, glace, bay, nova, scotia, canada, became, the, world, s, first, radio, message, to, cross, the, atlantic, from, north, america, in, 1904, a, commercial, service, was, established, to, transmit, nightly, news, summaries, to, subscribing, ships, which, incorporated, them, into, their, onboard, newspapers, world, war, i, accelerated, the, development, of, radio, for, military, communications, after, the, war, commercial, radio, am, broadcasting, began, in, the, 1920s, and, became, an, important, mass, medium, for, entertainment, and, news, world, war, ii, again, accelerated, the, development, of, radio, for, the, wartime, purposes, of, aircraft, and, land, communication, radio, navigation, and, radar, development, of, stereo, fm, broadcasting, of, radio, began, in, the, 1930s, in, the, united, states, and, the, 1970s, in, the, united, kingdom, displacing, am, as, the, dominant, commercial, standard, on, 25, march, 1925, john, logie, baird, demonstrated, the, transmission, of, moving, pictures, at, the, london, department, store, selfridges, baird, s, device, relied, upon, the, nipkow, disk, and, thus, became, known, as, the, mechanical, television, it, formed, the, basis, of, experimental, broadcasts, done, by, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, beginning, on, 30, september, 1929, however, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, televisions, depended, on, the, cathode, ray, tube, invented, by, karl, braun, the, first, version, of, such, a, television, to, show, promise, was, produced, by, philo, farnsworth, and, demonstrated, to, his, family, on, 7, september, 1927, after, world, war, ii, interrupted, experiments, resumed, and, television, became, an, important, home, entertainment, broadcast, medium, using, vhf, and, uhf, spectrum, satellite, broadcasting, was, initiated, in, the, 1960s, and, moved, into, general, industry, usage, in, the, 1970s, with, dbs, direct, broadcast, satellites, emerging, in, the, 1980s, originally, all, broadcasting, was, composed, of, analog, signals, using, analog, transmission, techniques, but, in, the, 2000s, broadcasters, switched, to, digital, signals, using, digital, transmission, an, analog, signal, is, any, continuous, signal, representing, some, other, quantity, i, e, analogous, to, another, quantity, for, example, in, an, analog, audio, signal, the, instantaneous, signal, voltage, varies, continuously, with, the, pressure, of, the, sound, waves, in, contrast, a, digital, signal, represents, the, original, time, varying, quantity, as, a, sampled, sequence, of, quantized, values, which, imposes, some, bandwidth, and, dynamic, range, constraints, on, the, representation, in, general, usage, broadcasting, most, frequently, refers, to, the, transmission, of, information, and, entertainment, programming, from, various, sources, to, the, general, public, the, world, s, technological, capacity, to, receive, information, through, one, way, broadcast, networks, more, than, quadrupled, during, the, two, decades, from, 1986, to, 2007, from, 432, exabytes, of, optimally, compressed, information, to, 1, 9, zettabytes, this, is, the, information, equivalent, of, 55, newspapers, per, person, per, day, in, 1986, and, 175, newspapers, per, person, per, day, by, 2007, in, a, broadcast, system, the, central, high, powered, broadcast, tower, transmits, a, high, frequency, electromagnetic, wave, to, numerous, receivers, the, high, frequency, wave, sent, by, the, tower, is, modulated, with, a, signal, containing, visual, or, audio, information, the, receiver, is, then, tuned, so, as, to, pick, up, the, high, frequency, wave, and, a, demodulator, is, used, to, retrieve, the, signal, containing, the, visual, or, audio, information, the, broadcast, signal, can, be, either, analog, signal, is, varied, continuously, with, respect, to, the, information, or, digital, information, is, encoded, as, a, set, of, discrete, values, historically, there, have, been, several, methods, used, for, broadcasting, electronic, media, audio, and, video, to, the, general, public, there, are, several, means, of, providing, financial, support, for, continuous, broadcasting, broadcasters, may, rely, on, a, combination, of, these, business, models, for, example, in, the, united, states, national, public, radio, npr, and, the, public, broadcasting, service, pbs, television, supplement, public, membership, subscriptions, and, grants, with, funding, from, the, corporation, for, public, broadcasting, cpb, which, is, allocated, bi, annually, by, congress, us, public, broadcasting, corporate, and, charitable, grants, are, generally, given, in, consideration, of, underwriting, spots, which, differ, from, commercial, advertisements, in, that, they, are, governed, by, specific, fcc, restrictions, which, prohibit, the, advocacy, of, a, product, or, a, call, to, action, the, first, regular, television, broadcasts, started, in, 1937, broadcasts, can, be, classified, as, recorded, or, live, the, former, allows, correcting, errors, and, removing, superfluous, or, undesired, material, rearranging, it, applying, slow, motion, and, repetitions, and, other, techniques, to, enhance, the, program, however, some, live, events, like, sports, television, can, include, some, of, the, aspects, including, slow, motion, clips, of, important, goals, hits, etc, in, between, the, live, television, telecast, american, radio, network, broadcasters, habitually, forbade, prerecorded, broadcasts, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, requiring, radio, programs, played, for, the, eastern, and, central, time, zones, to, be, repeated, three, hours, later, for, the, pacific, time, zone, see, effects, of, time, on, north, american, broadcasting, this, restriction, was, dropped, for, special, occasions, as, in, the, case, of, the, german, dirigible, airship, hindenburg, disaster, at, lakehurst, new, jersey, in, 1937, during, world, war, ii, prerecorded, broadcasts, from, war, correspondents, were, allowed, on, u, s, radio, in, addition, american, radio, programs, were, recorded, for, playback, by, armed, forces, radio, radio, stations, around, the, world, a, disadvantage, of, recording, first, is, that, the, public, may, learn, the, outcome, of, an, event, before, the, recording, is, broadcast, which, may, be, a, spoiler, prerecording, may, be, used, to, prevent, announcers, from, deviating, from, an, officially, approved, script, during, a, live, radio, broadcast, as, occurred, with, propaganda, broadcasts, from, germany, in, the, 1940s, and, with, radio, moscow, in, the, 1980s, many, events, are, advertised, as, being, live, although, they, are, often, recorded, live, sometimes, called, live, to, tape, this, is, particularly, true, of, performances, of, musical, artists, on, radio, when, they, visit, for, an, in, studio, concert, performance, similar, situations, have, occurred, in, television, production, the, cosby, show, is, recorded, in, front, of, a, live, television, studio, audience, and, news, broadcasting, a, broadcast, may, be, distributed, through, several, physical, means, if, coming, directly, from, the, radio, studio, at, a, single, station, or, television, station, it, is, sent, through, the, studio, transmitter, link, to, the, transmitter, and, hence, from, the, television, antenna, located, on, the, radio, masts, and, towers, out, to, the, world, programming, may, also, come, through, a, communications, satellite, played, either, live, or, recorded, for, later, transmission, networks, of, stations, may, simulcast, the, same, programming, at, the, same, time, originally, via, microwave, link, now, usually, by, satellite, distribution, to, stations, or, networks, may, also, be, through, physical, media, such, as, magnetic, tape, compact, disc, cd, dvd, and, sometimes, other, formats, usually, these, are, included, in, another, broadcast, such, as, when, electronic, news, gathering, eng, returns, a, story, to, the, station, for, inclusion, on, a, news, programme, the, final, leg, of, broadcast, distribution, is, how, the, signal, gets, to, the, listener, or, viewer, it, may, come, over, the, air, as, with, a, radio, station, or, television, station, to, an, antenna, and, radio, receiver, or, may, come, through, cable, television, or, cable, radio, or, wireless, cable, via, the, station, or, directly, from, a, network, the, internet, may, also, bring, either, internet, radio, or, streaming, media, television, to, the, recipient, especially, with, multicasting, allowing, the, signal, and, bandwidth, to, be, shared, the, term, broadcast, network, is, often, used, to, distinguish, networks, that, broadcast, over, the, air, television, signals, that, can, be, received, using, a, tuner, inside, a, television, set, with, a, television, antenna, from, so, called, networks, that, are, broadcast, only, via, cable, television, cablecast, or, satellite, television, that, uses, a, dish, antenna, the, term, broadcast, television, can, refer, to, the, television, programs, of, such, networks, the, sequencing, of, content, in, a, broadcast, is, called, a, schedule, as, with, all, technological, endeavors, a, number, of, technical, terms, and, slang, have, developed, a, list, of, these, terms, can, be, found, at, list, of, broadcasting, terms, television, and, radio, programs, are, distributed, through, radio, broadcasting, or, cable, often, both, simultaneously, by, coding, signals, and, having, a, cable, converter, box, with, decoding, equipment, in, homes, the, latter, also, enables, subscription, based, channels, pay, tv, and, pay, per, view, services, in, his, essay, john, durham, peters, wrote, that, communication, is, a, tool, used, for, dissemination, peters, stated, dissemination, is, a, lens, sometimes, a, usefully, distorting, one, that, helps, us, tackle, basic, issues, such, as, interaction, presence, and, space, and, time, on, the, agenda, of, any, future, communication, theory, in, general, 211, dissemination, focuses, on, the, message, being, relayed, from, one, main, source, to, one, large, audience, without, the, exchange, of, dialogue, in, between, it, is, possible, for, the, message, to, be, changed, or, corrupted, by, government, officials, once, the, main, source, releases, it, there, is, no, way, to, predetermine, how, the, larger, population, or, audience, will, absorb, the, message, they, can, choose, to, listen, analyze, or, ignore, it, dissemination, in, communication, is, widely, used, in, the, world, of, broadcasting, broadcasting, focuses, on, getting, a, message, out, and, it, is, up, to, the, general, public, to, do, what, they, wish, with, it, peters, also, states, that, broadcasting, is, used, to, address, an, open, ended, destination, 212, there, are, many, forms, of, broadcasting, but, they, all, aim, to, distribute, a, signal, that, will, reach, the, target, audience, broadcasters, typically, arrange, audiences, into, entire, assemblies, 213, in, terms, of, media, broadcasting, a, radio, show, can, gather, a, large, number, of, followers, who, tune, in, every, day, to, specifically, listen, to, that, specific, disc, jockey, the, disc, jockey, follows, the, script, for, his, or, her, radio, show, and, just, talks, into, the, microphone, he, or, she, does, not, expect, immediate, feedback, from, any, listeners, the, message, is, broadcast, across, airwaves, throughout, the, community, but, there, the, listeners, cannot, always, respond, immediately, especially, since, many, radio, shows, are, recorded, prior, to, the, actual, air, time, conversely, receivers, can, select, opt, in, or, opt, out, of, getting, broadcast, messages, using, an, excel, file, offering, them, control, over, the, information, they, receive, broadcast, engineering, is, the, field, of, electrical, engineering, and, now, to, some, extent, computer, engineering, and, information, technology, which, deals, with, radio, and, television, broadcasting, audio, engineering, and, rf, engineering, are, also, essential, parts, of, broadcast, engineering, being, their, own, subsets, of, electrical, engineering, broadcast, engineering, involves, both, the, studio, and, transmitter, aspects, the, entire, airchain, as, well, as, remote, broadcasts, every, station, has, a, broadcast, engineer, though, one, may, now, serve, an, entire, station, group, in, a, city, in, small, media, markets, the, engineer, may, work, on, a, contract, basis, for, one, or, more, stations, as, needed
