homes, there, were, upwards, of, three, kitchens, the, kitchens, were, divided, based, on, the, types, of, food, prepared, in, them, the, kitchen, might, be, separate, from, the, great, hall, due, to, the, smoke, from, cooking, fires, and, the, chance, the, fires, may, get, out, of, control, few, medieval, kitchens, survive, as, they, were, notoriously, ephemeral, structures, in, connecticut, as, in, other, colonies, of, new, england, during, colonial, america, kitchens, were, often, built, as, separate, rooms, and, were, located, behind, the, parlor, and, keeping, room, or, dining, room, one, early, record, of, a, kitchen, is, found, in, the, 1648, inventory, of, the, estate, of, a, john, porter, of, windsor, connecticut, the, inventory, lists, goods, in, the, house, over, the, kittchin, and, in, the, kittchin, the, items, listed, in, the, kitchen, were, silver, spoons, pewter, brass, iron, arms, ammunition, hemp, flax, and, other, implements, about, the, room, a, stepping, stone, to, the, modern, fitted, kitchen, was, the, frankfurt, kitchen, designed, by, margarete, sch, tte, lihotzky, for, social, housing, projects, in, 1926, this, kitchen, measured, 1, 9, by, 3, 4, metres, 6, ft, 3, in, by, 11, ft, 2, in, and, was, built, to, optimize, kitchen, efficiency, and, lower, building, costs, the, design, was, the, result, of, detailed, time, motion, studies, and, interviews, with, future, tenants, to, identify, what, they, needed, from, their, kitchens, sch, tte, lihotzky, s, fitted, kitchen, was, built, in, some, 10, 000, apartments, in, housing, projects, erected, in, frankfurt, in, the, 1930s, the, frankfurt, kitchen, of, 1926, was, made, of, several, materials, depending, on, the, application, the, modern, built, in, kitchens, of, today, use, particle, boards, or, mdf, decorated, with, a, variety, of, materials, and, finishes, including, wood, veneers, lacquer, glass, melamine, laminate, ceramic, and, eco, gloss, very, few, manufacturers, produce, home, built, in, kitchens, from, stainless, steel, until, the, 1950s, steel, kitchens, were, used, by, architects, but, this, material, was, displaced, by, the, cheaper, particle, board, panels, sometimes, decorated, with, a, steel, surface, domestic, or, residential, kitchen, design, is, a, relatively, recent, discipline, the, first, ideas, to, optimize, the, work, in, the, kitchen, go, back, to, catharine, beecher, s, a, treatise, on, domestic, economy, 1843, revised, and, republished, together, with, her, sister, harriet, beecher, stowe, as, the, american, woman, s, home, in, 1869, beecher, s, model, kitchen, propagated, for, the, first, time, a, systematic, design, based, on, early, ergonomics, the, design, included, regular, shelves, on, the, walls, ample, workspace, and, dedicated, storage, areas, for, various, food, items, beecher, even, separated, the, functions, of, preparing, food, and, cooking, it, altogether, by, moving, the, stove, into, a, compartment, adjacent, to, the, kitchen, christine, frederick, published, from, 1913, a, series, of, articles, on, new, household, management, in, which, she, analyzed, the, kitchen, following, taylorist, principles, of, efficiency, presented, detailed, time, motion, studies, and, derived, a, kitchen, design, from, them, her, ideas, were, taken, up, in, the, 1920s, by, architects, in, germany, and, austria, most, notably, bruno, taut, erna, meyer, margarete, sch, tte, lihotzky, and, benita, otte, who, designed, the, first, fitted, kitchen, for, the, haus, am, horn, which, was, completed, in, 1923, similar, design, principles, were, employed, by, sch, tte, lihotzky, for, her, famous, frankfurt, kitchen, designed, for, ernst, may, s, r, merstadt, a, social, housing, project, in, frankfurt, in, 1927, while, this, work, kitchen, and, variants, derived, from, it, were, a, great, success, for, tenement, buildings, homeowners, had, different, demands, and, did, not, want, to, be, constrained, by, a, 6, 4, square, metre, 69, sq, ft, kitchen, nevertheless, the, kitchen, design, was, mostly, ad, hoc, following, the, whims, of, the, architect, in, the, u, s, the, small, homes, council, since, 1993, the, building, research, council, of, the, school, of, architecture, of, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, was, founded, in, 1944, with, the, goal, to, improve, the, state, of, the, art, in, home, building, originally, with, an, emphasis, on, standardization, for, cost, reduction, it, was, there, that, the, notion, of, the, kitchen, work, triangle, was, formalized, the, three, main, functions, in, a, kitchen, are, storage, preparation, and, cooking, which, catharine, beecher, had, already, recognized, and, the, places, for, these, functions, should, be, arranged, in, the, kitchen, in, such, a, way, that, work, at, one, place, does, not, interfere, with, work, at, another, place, the, distance, between, these, places, is, not, unnecessarily, large, and, no, obstacles, are, in, the, way, a, natural, arrangement, is, a, triangle, with, the, refrigerator, the, sink, and, the, stove, at, a, vertex, each, this, observation, led, to, a, few, common, kitchen, forms, commonly, characterized, by, the, arrangement, of, the, kitchen, cabinets, and, sink, stove, and, refrigerator, in, the, 1980s, there, was, a, backlash, against, industrial, kitchen, planning, and, cabinets, with, people, installing, a, mix, of, work, surfaces, and, free, standing, furniture, led, by, kitchen, designer, johnny, grey, and, his, concept, of, the, unfitted, kitchen, modern, kitchens, often, have, enough, informal, space, to, allow, for, people, to, eat, in, it, without, having, to, use, the, formal, dining, room, such, areas, are, called, breakfast, areas, breakfast, nooks, or, breakfast, bars, if, space, is, integrated, into, a, kitchen, counter, kitchens, with, enough, space, to, eat, in, are, sometimes, called, eat, in, kitchens, during, the, 2000s, flat, pack, kitchens, were, popular, for, people, doing, diy, renovating, on, a, budget, the, flat, pack, kitchens, industry, makes, it, easy, to, put, together, and, mix, and, matching, doors, bench, tops, and, cabinets, in, flat, pack, systems, many, components, can, be, interchanged, in, larger, homes, where, the, owners, might, have, meals, prepared, by, a, household, staff, member, the, home, may, have, a, chef, s, kitchen, this, typically, differs, from, a, normal, domestic, kitchen, by, having, multiple, ovens, possibly, of, different, kinds, for, different, kinds, of, cooking, multiple, sinks, and, warming, drawers, to, keep, food, heated, between, cooking, and, service, restaurant, and, canteen, kitchens, found, in, hotels, hospitals, educational, and, workplace, facilities, army, barracks, and, similar, institutions, are, generally, in, developed, countries, subject, to, public, health, laws, they, are, inspected, periodically, by, public, health, officials, and, forced, to, close, if, they, do, not, meet, hygienic, requirements, mandated, by, law, canteen, kitchens, and, castle, kitchens, were, often, the, places, where, new, technology, was, used, first, for, instance, benjamin, thompson, s, energy, saving, stove, an, early, 19th, century, fully, closed, iron, stove, using, one, fire, to, heat, several, pots, was, designed, for, large, kitchens, another, thirty, years, passed, before, they, were, adapted, for, domestic, use, as, of, 2017, restaurant, kitchens, usually, have, tiled, walls, and, floors, and, use, stainless, steel, for, other, surfaces, workbench, but, also, door, and, drawer, fronts, because, these, materials, are, durable, and, easy, to, clean, professional, kitchens, are, often, equipped, with, gas, stoves, as, these, allow, cooks, to, regulate, the, heat, more, quickly, and, more, finely, than, electrical, stoves, some, special, appliances, are, typical, for, professional, kitchens, such, as, large, installed, deep, fryers, steamers, or, a, bain, marie, the, fast, food, and, convenience, food, trends, have, changed, the, manner, in, which, restaurant, kitchens, operate, some, of, these, type, restaurants, may, only, finish, convenience, food, that, is, delivered, to, them, or, just, reheat, completely, prepared, meals, at, the, most, they, may, grill, a, hamburger, or, a, steak, but, in, the, early, 21st, century, c, stores, convenience, stores, are, attracting, greater, market, share, by, performing, more, food, preparation, on, site, and, better, customer, service, than, some, fast, food, outlets, the, kitchens, in, railway, dining, cars, have, presented, special, challenges, space, is, limited, and, personnel, must, be, able, to, serve, a, great, number, of, meals, quickly, especially, in, the, early, history, of, railways, this, required, flawless, organization, of, processes, in, modern, times, the, microwave, oven, and, prepared, meals, have, made, this, task, much, easier, kitchens,
