often, from, horseback, the, sabre, s, long, curved, blade, and, slightly, forward, weight, balance, gave, it, a, deadly, character, all, its, own, on, the, battlefield, most, sabres, also, had, sharp, points, and, double, edged, blades, making, them, capable, of, piercing, soldier, after, soldier, in, a, cavalry, charge, sabres, continued, to, see, battlefield, use, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, us, navy, m1917, cutlass, used, in, world, war, i, was, kept, in, their, armory, well, into, world, war, ii, and, many, marines, were, issued, a, variant, called, the, m1941, cutlass,

cm, 24, in, long, some, of, them, are, inlaid, with, silver, the, sword, developed, from, the, knife, or, dagger, the, sword, became, differentiated, from, the, dagger, during, the, bronze, age, c, 3000, bc, when, copper, and, bronze, weapons, were, produced, with, long, leaf, shaped, blades, and, with, hilts, consisting, of, an, extension, of, the, blade, in, handle, form, a, knife, is, unlike, a, dagger, in, that, a, knife, has, only, one, cutting, surface, while, a, dagger, has, two, cutting, surfaces, construction, of, longer, blades, became, possible, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, in, the, middle, east, first, in, arsenic, copper, then, in, tin, bronze, blades, longer, than, 60, cm, 24, in, were, rare, and, not, practical, until, the, late, bronze, age, because, the, young, s, modulus, stiffness, of, bronze, is, relatively, low, and, consequently, longer, blades, would, bend, easily, the, development, of, the, sword, out, of, the, dagger, was, gradual, the, first, weapons, that, can, be, classified, as, swords, without, any, ambiguity, are, those, found, in, minoan, crete, dated, to, about, 1700, bc, reaching, a, total, length, of, more, than, 100, cm, 39, in, these, are, the, type, a, swords, of, the, aegean, bronze, age, one, of, the, most, important, and, longest, lasting, types, of, swords, of, the, european, bronze, age, was, the, naue, ii, type, named, for, julius, naue, who, first, described, them, also, known, as, griffzungenschwert, lit, grip, tongue, sword, this, type, first, appears, in, c, the, 13th, century, bc, in, northern, italy, or, a, general, urnfield, background, and, survives, well, into, the, iron, age, with, a, life, span, of, about, seven, centuries, during, its, lifetime, metallurgy, changed, from, bronze, to, iron, but, not, its, basic, design, naue, ii, swords, were, exported, from, europe, to, the, aegean, and, as, far, afield, as, ugarit, beginning, about, 1200, bc, i, e, just, a, few, decades, before, the, final, collapse, of, the, palace, cultures, in, the, bronze, age, collapse, naue, ii, swords, could, be, as, long, as, 85, cm, but, most, specimens, fall, into, the, 60, to, 70, cm, range, robert, drews, linked, the, naue, type, ii, swords, which, spread, from, southern, europe, into, the, mediterranean, with, the, bronze, age, collapse, naue, ii, swords, along, with, nordic, full, hilted, swords, were, made, with, functionality, and, aesthetics, in, mind, the, hilts, of, these, swords, were, beautifully, crafted, and, often, contained, false, rivets, in, order, to, make, the, sword, more, visually, appealing, swords, coming, from, northern, denmark, and, northern, germany, usually, contained, three, or, more, fake, rivets, in, the, hilt, sword, production, in, china, is, attested, from, the, bronze, age, shang, dynasty, the, technology, for, bronze, swords, reached, its, high, point, during, the, warring, states, period, and, qin, dynasty, amongst, the, warring, states, period, swords, some, unique, technologies, were, used, such, as, casting, high, tin, edges, over, softer, lower, tin, cores, or, the, application, of, diamond, shaped, patterns, on, the, blade, see, sword, of, goujian, also, unique, for, chinese, bronzes, is, the, consistent, use, of, high, tin, bronze, 17, 21, tin, which, is, very, hard, and, breaks, if, stressed, too, far, whereas, other, cultures, preferred, lower, tin, bronze, usually, 10, which, bends, if, stressed, too, far, although, iron, swords, were, made, alongside, bronze, it, was, not, until, the, early, han, period, that, iron, completely, replaced, bronze, in, the, indian, subcontinent, earliest, available, bronze, age, swords, of, copper, were, discovered, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, sites, in, the, northwestern, regions, of, south, asia, swords, have, been, recovered, in, archaeological, findings, throughout, the, ganges, jamuna, doab, region, of, indian, subcontinent, consisting, of, bronze, but, more, commonly, copper, diverse, specimens, have, been, discovered, in, fatehgarh, where, there, are, several, varieties, of, hilt, these, swords, have, been, variously, dated, to, times, between, 1700, and, 1400, bc, other, swords, from, this, period, in, india, have, been, discovered, from, kallur, raichur, iron, became, increasingly, common, from, the, 13th, century, bc, before, that, the, use, of, swords, was, less, frequent, the, iron, was, not, quench, hardened, although, often, containing, sufficient, carbon, but, work, hardened, like, bronze, by, hammering, this, made, them, comparable, or, only, slightly, better, in, terms, of, strength, and, hardness, to, bronze, swords, they, could, still, bend, during, use, rather, than, spring, back, into, shape, but, the, easier, production, and, the, better, availability, of, the, raw, material, for, the, first, time, permitted, the, equipping, of, entire, armies, with, metal, weapons, though, bronze, age, egyptian, armies, were, sometimes, fully, equipped, with, bronze, weapons, ancient, swords, are, often, found, at, burial, sites, the, sword, was, often, placed, on, the, right, side, of, the, corpse, many, times, the, sword, was, kept, over, the, corpse, in, many, late, iron, age, graves, the, sword, and, the, scabbard, were, bent, at, 180, degrees, it, was, known, as, killing, the, sword, thus, they, might, have, considered, swords, as, the, most, potent, and, powerful, object, high, carbon, steel, for, swords, which, would, later, appear, as, damascus, steel, was, likely, introduced, in, india, around, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bc, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, mentions, swords, of, indian, iron, and, steel, being, exported, from, ancient, india, to, ancient, greece, blades, from, the, indian, subcontinent, made, of, damascus, steel, also, found, their, way, into, persia, by, the, time, of, classical, antiquity, and, the, parthian, and, sassanid, empires, in, iran, iron, swords, were, common, the, greek, xiphos, and, the, roman, gladius, are, typical, examples, of, the, type, measuring, some, 60, to, 70, cm, 24, to, 28, in, the, late, roman, empire, introduced, the, longer, spatha, the, term, for, its, wielder, spatharius, became, a, court, rank, in, constantinople, and, from, this, time, the, term, longsword, is, applied, to, swords, comparatively, long, for, their, respective, periods, swords, from, the, parthian, and, sassanian, empires, were, quite, long, the, blades, on, some, late, sassanian, swords, being, just, under, a, metre, long, swords, were, also, used, to, administer, various, physical, punishments, such, as, non, surgical, amputation, or, capital, punishment, by, decapitation, the, use, of, a, sword, an, honourable, weapon, was, regarded, in, europe, since, roman, times, as, a, privilege, reserved, for, the, nobility, and, the, upper, classes, in, the, first, millennium, bc, the, persian, armies, used, a, sword, that, was, originally, of, scythian, design, called, the, akinaka, acinaces, however, the, great, conquests, of, the, persians, made, the, sword, more, famous, as, a, persian, weapon, to, the, extent, that, the, true, nature, of, the, weapon, has, been, lost, somewhat, as, the, name, akinaka, has, been, used, to, refer, to, whichever, form, of, sword, the, persian, army, favoured, at, the, time, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, original, akinaka, was, a, 35, to, 45, cm, 14, to, 18, inch, double, edged, sword, the, design, was, not, uniform, and, in, fact, identification, is, made, more, on, the, nature, of, the, scabbard, than, the, weapon, itself, the, scabbard, usually, has, a, large, decorative, mount, allowing, it, to, be, suspended, from, a, belt, on, the, wearer, s, right, side, because, of, this, it, is, assumed, that, the, sword, was, intended, to, be, drawn, with, the, blade, pointing, downwards, ready, for, surprise, stabbing, attacks, in, the, 12th, century, the, seljuq, dynasty, had, introduced, the, curved, shamshir, to, persia, and, this, was, in, extensive, use, by, the, early, 16th, century, chinese, iron, swords, made, their, first, appearance, in, the, later, part, of, the,

well, into, the, middle, ages, vendel, age, spathas, were, decorated, with, germanic, artwork, not, unlike, the, germanic, bracteates, fashioned, after, roman, coins, the, viking, age, saw, again, a, more, standardized, production, but, the, basic, design, remained, indebted, to, the, spatha, around, the, 10th, century, the, use, of, properly, quenched, hardened, and, tempered, steel, started, to, become, much, more, common, than, in, previous, periods, the, frankish, ulfberht, blades, the, name, of, the, maker, inlaid, in, the, blade, were, of, particularly, consistent, high, quality, charles,

unique, and, highly, prized, steel, developed, on, the, indian, subcontinent, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, bc, its, properties, were, unique, due, to, the, special, smelting, and, reworking, of, the, steel, creating, networks, of, iron, carbides, described, as, a, globular, cementite, in, a, matrix, of, pearlite, the, use, of, damascus, steel, in, swords, became, extremely, popular, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, it, was, only, from, the, 11th, century, that, norman, swords, began, to, develop, the, crossguard, quillons, during, the, crusades, of, the, 12th, to, 13th, century, this,

effective, points, were, becoming, common, to, counter, improvements, in, armour, especially, the, 14th, century, change, from, mail, to, plate, armour, it, was, during, the, 14th, century, with, the, growing, use, of, more, advanced, armour, that, the, hand, and, a, half, sword, also, known, as, a, bastard, sword, came, into, being, it, had, an, extended, grip, that, meant, it, could, be, used, with, either, one, or, two, hands, though, these, swords, did, not, provide, a, full, two, hand, grip, they, allowed, their, wielders, to, hold, a, shield, or, parrying, dagger, in, their, off, hand, or, to, use, it, as, a, two, handed, sword, for, a, more, powerful, blow, in, the, middle, ages, the, sword, was, often, used, as, a, symbol, of, the, word, of, god, the, names, given, to, many,

america, despite, the, fact, that, natives, were, reluctant, to, allow, outsiders, in, on, their, fighting, secrets, the, macuahuitl, is, a, wooden, broadsword, and, club, that, was, utilized, by, various, mesoamerican, civilizations, such, as, those, of, the, aztecs, maya, olmecs, toltecs, and, mixtecs, in, the, gilbert, islands, the, native, kiribati, people, have, developed, a, type, of, broadsword, made, from, shark, teeth, which, serves, a, similar, function, to, the, leiomano, used, by, the, native, hawaiians, a, single, edged, type, of, sidearm, used, by, the, hussites, was, popularized, in, 16th, century, germany, under, its, czech, name, dusack, also, known, as, s, bel, auf, teutsch, gefasst, sabre, fitted, in, the, german, manner, a, closely, related, weapon, is, the, schnepf, or, swiss, sabre, used, in, early, modern, switzerland, the, cut, and, thrust, mortuary, sword, was, used, after, 1625, by, cavalry, during, the, english, civil, war, this, usually, two, edged, sword, sported, a, half, basket, hilt, with, a, straight, blade, some, 90, 105, cm, long, later, in, the, 17th, century, the, swords, used, by, cavalry, became, predominantly, single, edged, the, so, called, walloon, sword, p, e, wallone, was, common, in, the, thirty, years, war, and, baroque, era, its, hilt, was, ambidextrous, with, shell, guards, and, knuckle, bow, that, inspired, 18th, century, continental, hunting, hangers, following, their, campaign, in, the, netherlands, in, 1672, the, french, began, producing, this, weapon, as, their, first, regulation, sword, weapons, of, this, design, were, also, issued, to, the, swedish, army, from, the, time, of, gustavus, adolphus, until, as, late, as, the, 1850s, the, rapier, is, believed, to, have, evolved, either, from, the, spanish, espada, ropera, or, from, the, swords, of, the, italian, nobility, somewhere, in, the, later, part, of, the, 16th, century, the, rapier, differed, from, most, earlier, swords, in, that, it, was, not, a, military, weapon, but, a, primarily, civilian, sword, both, the, rapier, and, the, italian, schiavona, developed, the, crossguard, into, a, basket, shaped, guard, for, hand, protection, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, shorter, small, sword, became, an, essential, fashion, accessory, in, european, countries, and, the, new, world, though, in, some, places, such, as, the, scottish, highlands, large, swords, as, the, basket, hilted, broadsword, were, preferred, and, most, wealthy, men, and, military, officers, carried, one, slung, from, a, belt, both, the, small, sword, and, the, rapier, remained, popular, dueling, swords, well, into, the, 18th, century, as, the, wearing, of, swords, fell, out, of, fashion, canes, took, their, place, in, a, gentleman, s, wardrobe, this, developed, to, the, gentlemen, in, the, victorian, era, to, use, the, umbrella, some, examples, of, canes, those, known, as, sword, canes, or, swordsticks, incorporate, a, concealed, blade, the, french, martial, art, la, canne, developed, to, fight, with, canes, and, swordsticks, and, has, now, evolved, into, a, sport, the, english, martial, art, singlestick, is, very, similar, with, the, rise, of, the, pistol, duel, the, duelling, sword, fell, out, of, fashion, long, before, the, practice, of, duelling, itself, by, about, 1770, english, duelists, enthusiastically, adopted, the, pistol, and, sword, duels, dwindled, however, the, custom, of, duelling, with, ep, es, persisted, well, into, the, 20th, century, in, france, such, modern, duels, were, not, fought, to, the, death, the, duellists, aim, was, instead, merely, to, draw, blood, from, the, opponent, s, sword, arm, towards, the, end, of, its, useful, life, the, sword, served, more, as, a, weapon, of, self, defence, than, for, use, on, the, battlefield, and, the, military, importance, of, swords, steadily, decreased, during, the, modern, age, even, as, a, personal, sidearm, the, sword, began, to, lose, its, preeminence, in, the, early, 19th, century, reflecting, the, development, of, reliable, handguns, however, swords, were, still, normally, carried, in, combat, by, cavalrymen, and, by, officers, of, other, branches, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, both, in, colonial, and, european, warfare, for, example, during, the, aceh, war, the, acehnese, klewangs, a, sword, similar, to, the, machete, proved, very, effective, in, close, quarters, combat, with, dutch, troops, leading, the, royal, netherlands, east, indies, army, to, adopt, a, heavy, cutlass, also, called, klewang, very, similar, in, appearance, to, the, us, navy, model, 1917, cutlass, to, counter, it, mobile, troops, armed, with, carbines, and, klewangs, succeeded, in, suppressing, aceh, resistance, where, traditional, infantry, with, rifle, and, bayonet, had, failed, from, that, time, on, until, the, 1950s, the, royal, dutch, east, indies, army, royal, dutch, army, royal, dutch, navy, and, dutch, police, used, these, cutlasses, called, klewang, swords, continued, in, general, peacetime, use, by, cavalry, of, most, armies, during, the, years, prior, to, world, war, i, the, british, army, formally, adopted, a, completely, new, design, of, cavalry, sword, in, 1908, almost, the, last, change, in, british, army, weapons, before, the, outbreak, of, the, war, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, infantry, officers, in, all, combatant, armies, then, involved, french, german, british, austro, hungarian, russian, belgian, and, serbian, still, carried, swords, as, part, of, their, field, equipment, on, mobilization, in, august, 1914, all, serving, british, army, officers, were, required, to, have, their, swords, sharpened, as, the, only, peacetime, use, of, the, weapon, had, been, for, saluting, on, parade, the, high, visibility, and, limited, practical, use, of, the, sword, however, led, to, it, being, abandoned, within, weeks, although, most, cavalry, continued, to, carry, sabres, throughout, the, war, while, retained, as, a, symbol, of, rank, and, status, by, at, least, senior, officers, of, infantry, artillery, and, other, branches, the, sword, was, usually, left, with, non, essential, baggage, when, units, reached, the, front, line, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, that, this, historic, weapon, was, finally, discarded, for, all, but, ceremonial, purposes, by, most, remaining, horse, mounted, regiments, of, europe, and, the, americas, in, china, troops, used, the, long, anti, cavalry, miao, dao, well, into, the, second, sino, japanese, war, the, last, units, of, british, heavy, cavalry, switched, to, using, armoured, vehicles, as, late, as, 1938, swords, and, other, dedicated, melee, weapons, were, used, occasionally, by, many, countries, during, world, war, ii, but, typically, as, a, secondary, weapon, as, they, were, outclassed, by, coexisting, firearms, a, notable, exception, was, the, imperial, japanese, army, where, for, cultural, reasons, all, officers, and, warrant, officers, carried, the, shin, gunto, new, military, sword, into, battle, from, 1934, until, 1945, swords, are, commonly, worn, as, a, ceremonial, item, by, officers, in, many, military, and, naval, services, throughout, the, world, occasions, to, wear, swords, include, any, event, in, dress, uniforms, where, the, rank, and, file,
