a, modern, torpedo, is, an, underwater, ranged, weapon, launched, above, or, below, the, water, surface, self, propelled, towards, a, target, and, with, an, explosive, warhead, designed, to, detonate, either, on, contact, with, or, in, proximity, to, the, target, historically, such, a, device, was, called, an, automotive, automobile, locomotive, or, fish, torpedo, colloquially, a, fish, the, term, torpedo, originally, applied, to, a, variety, of, devices, most, of, which, would, today, be, called, mines, from, about, 1900, torpedo, has, been, used, strictly, to, designate, a, self, propelled, underwater, explosive, device, while, the, 19th, century, battleship, had, evolved, primarily, with, a, view, to, engagements, between, armored, warships, with, large, caliber, guns, the, invention, and, refinement, of, torpedoes, from, the, 1860s, onwards, allowed, small, torpedo, boats, and, other, lighter, surface, vessels, submarines, submersibles, even, improvised, fishing, boats, or, frogmen, and, later, light, aircraft, to, destroy, large, ships, without, the, need, of, large, guns, though, sometimes, at, the, risk, of, being, hit, by, longer, range, artillery, fire, modern, torpedoes, are, classified, variously, as, lightweight, or, heavyweight, straight, running, autonomous, homers, and, wire, guided, types, they, can, be, launched, from, a, variety, of, platforms, in, modern, warfare, a, submarine, launched, torpedo, is, almost, certain, to, hit, its, target, the, best, defense, is, a, counterattack, using, another, torpedo, the, word, torpedo, was, first, used, as, a, name, for, electric, rays, in, the, order, torpediniformes, which, in, turn, comes, from, the, latin, word, torp, d, lethargy, or, sluggishness, in, naval, usage, the, american, inventor, david, bushnell, was, reported, to, have, first, used, the, term, as, the, name, of, a, submarine, of, his, own, design, the, american, turtle, or, torpedo, this, usage, likely, inspired, robert, fulton, s, use, of, the, term, to, describe, his, stationary, mines, and, later, robert, whitehead, s, naming, of, the, first, self, propelled, torpedo, torpedo, like, weapons, were, first, proposed, many, centuries, before, they, were, successfully, developed, for, example, in, 1275, arab, engineer, hasan, al, rammah, who, worked, as, a, military, scientist, for, the, mamluk, sultanate, of, egypt, wrote, that, it, might, be, possible, to, create, a, projectile, resembling, an, egg, which, propelled, itself, through, water, whilst, carrying, fire, in, modern, language, a, torpedo, is, an, underwater, self, propelled, explosive, but, historically, the, term, also, applied, to, primitive, naval, mines, and, spar, torpedoes, these, were, used, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, during, the, early, modern, period, up, to, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, dutchman, cornelius, drebbel, in, the, employ, of, king, james, i, of, england, invented, the, spar, torpedo, he, attached, explosives, to, the, end, of, a, beam, affixed, to, one, of, his, submarines, these, were, used, to, little, effect, during, the, english, expeditions, to, la, rochelle, in, 1626, the, first, use, of, a, torpedo, by, a, submarine, was, in, 1775, by, the, american, turtle, which, attempted, to, lay, a, bomb, with, a, timed, fuse, on, the, hull, of, hms, eagle, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, but, failed, in, the, attempt, in, the, early, 1800s, the, american, inventor, robert, fulton, while, in, france, conceived, the, idea, of, destroying, ships, by, introducing, floating, mines, under, their, bottoms, in, submarine, boats, he, employed, the, term, torpedo, for, the, explosive, charges, with, which, he, outfitted, his, submarine, nautilus, however, both, the, french, and, the, dutch, governments, were, uninterested, in, the, submarine, fulton, then, concentrated, on, developing, the, torpedo, like, weapon, independent, of, a, submarine, deployment, and, in, 1804, succeeded, in, convincing, the, british, government, to, employ, his, catamaran, against, the, french, an, april, 1804, torpedo, attack, on, french, ships, anchored, at, boulogne, and, a, follow, up, attack, in, october, produced, several, explosions, but, no, significant, damage, and, the, weapon, was, abandoned, fulton, carried, out, a, demonstration, for, the, us, government, on, 20, july, 1807, destroying, a, vessel, in, new, york, s, harbor, further, development, languished, as, fulton, focused, on, his, steam, boat, matters, after, the, war, of, 1812, broke, out, the, royal, navy, established, a, blockade, of, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, during, the, war, american, forces, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, destroy, the, british, ship, of, the, line, hms, ramillies, while, it, was, lying, at, anchor, in, new, london, connecticut, s, harbor, with, torpedoes, launched, from, small, boats, this, prompted, the, captain, of, ramillies, sir, thomas, hardy, 1st, baronet, to, warn, the, americans, to, cease, using, this, cruel, and, unheard, of, warfare, or, he, would, order, every, house, near, the, shore, to, be, destroyed, the, fact, that, hardy, had, been, previously, so, lenient, and, considerate, to, the, americans, led, them, to, abandon, such, attempts, with, immediate, effect, torpedoes, were, used, by, the, russian, empire, during, the, crimean, war, in, 1855, against, british, warships, in, the, gulf, of, finland, they, used, an, early, form, of, chemical, detonator, during, the, american, civil, war, the, term, torpedo, was, used, for, what, is, today, called, a, contact, mine, floating, on, or, below, the, water, surface, using, an, air, filled, demijohn, or, similar, flotation, device, these, devices, were, very, primitive, and, apt, to, prematurely, explode, they, would, be, detonated, on, contact, with, the, ship, or, after, a, set, time, although, electrical, detonators, were, also, occasionally, used, uss, cairo, was, the, first, warship, to, be, sunk, in, 1862, by, an, electrically, detonated, mine, spar, torpedoes, were, also, used, an, explosive, device, was, mounted, at, the, end, of, a, spar, up, to, 30, feet, 9, 1, m, long, projecting, forward, underwater, from, the, bow, of, the, attacking, vessel, which, would, then, ram, the, opponent, with, the, explosives, these, were, used, by, the, confederate, submarine, h, l, hunley, to, sink, uss, housatonic, although, the, weapon, was, apt, to, cause, as, much, harm, to, its, user, as, to, its, target, rear, admiral, david, farragut, s, famous, apocryphal, command, during, the, battle, of, mobile, bay, in, 1864, damn, the, torpedoes, full, speed, ahead, refers, to, a, minefield, laid, at, mobile, alabama, on, 26, may, 1877, during, the, romanian, war, of, independence, the, romanian, spar, torpedo, boat, r, ndunica, attacked, and, sank, the, ottoman, river, monitor, seyfi, this, was, the, first, instance, in, history, when, a, torpedo, boat, sank, its, targets, without, also, sinking, a, prototype, of, the, self, propelled, torpedo, was, created, on, a, commission, placed, by, giovanni, luppis, an, austro, hungarian, naval, officer, from, rijeka, modern, day, croatia, at, the, time, a, port, city, of, the, austro, hungarian, monarchy, and, robert, whitehead, an, english, engineer, who, was, the, manager, of, a, town, factory, in, 1864, luppis, presented, whitehead, with, the, plans, of, the, salvacoste, coastsaver, a, floating, weapon, driven, by, ropes, from, the, land, that, had, been, dismissed, by, the, naval, authorities, due, to, the, impractical, steering, and, propulsion, mechanisms, in, 1866, whitehead, invented, the, first, effective, self, propelled, torpedo, the, eponymous, whitehead, torpedo, the, first, modern, torpedo, french, and, german, inventions, followed, closely, and, the, term, torpedo, came, to, describe, self, propelled, projectiles, that, traveled, under, or, on, water, by, 1900, the, term, no, longer, included, mines, and, booby, traps, as, the, navies, of, the, world, added, submarines, torpedo, boats, and, torpedo, boat, destroyers, to, their, fleets, whitehead, was, unable, to, improve, the, machine, substantially, since, the, clockwork, motor, attached, ropes, and, surface, attack, mode, all, contributed, to, a, slow, and, cumbersome, weapon, however, he, kept, considering, the, problem, after, the, contract, had, finished, and, eventually, developed, a, tubular, device, designed, to, run, underwater, on, its, own, and, powered, by, compressed, air, the, result, was, a, submarine, weapon, the, minenschiff, mine, ship, the, first, modern, self, propelled, torpedo, officially, presented, to, the, austrian, imperial, naval, commission, on, 21, december, 1866, the, first, trials, were, not, successful, as, the, weapon, was, unable, to, maintain, a, course, at, a, steady, depth, after, much, work, whitehead, introduced, his, secret, in, 1868, which, overcame, this, it, was, a, mechanism, consisting, of, a, hydrostatic, valve, and, pendulum, that, caused, the, torpedo, s, hydroplanes, to, be, adjusted, to, maintain, a, preset, depth, after, the, austrian, government, decided, to, invest, in, the, invention, whitehead, started, the, first, torpedo, factory, in, rijeka, in, 1870, he, improved, the, devices, to, travel, up, to, approximately, 1, 000, yards, 910, m, at, a, speed, of, up, to, 6, knots, 11, km, h, and, by, 1881, the, factory, was, exporting, torpedoes, to, ten, other, countries, the, torpedo, was, powered, by, compressed, air, and, had, an, explosive, charge, of, gun, cotton, whitehead, went, on, to, develop, more, efficient, devices, demonstrating, torpedoes, capable, of, 18, knots, 33, km, h, in, 1876, 24, knots, 44, km, h, in, 1886, and, finally, 30, knots, 56, km, h, in, 1890, royal, navy, rn, representatives, visited, rijeka, for, a, demonstration, in, late, 1869, and, in, 1870, a, batch, of, torpedoes, was, ordered, in, 1871, the, british, admiralty, paid, whitehead, 15, 000, for, certain, of, his, developments, and, production, started, at, the, royal, laboratories, in, woolwich, the, following, year, in, the, 1880s, a, british, committee, informed, by, hydrodynamicist, dr, r, e, froude, conducted, comparative, tests, and, determined, that, a, blunt, nose, contrary, to, prior, assumptions, did, not, hinder, speed, in, fact, the, blunt, nose, provided, a, speed, advantage, of, approximately, one, knot, compared, to, the, traditional, pointed, nose, design, this, discovery, allowed, for, larger, explosive, payloads, and, increased, air, storage, for, propulsion, without, compromising, speed, in, 1893, rn, torpedo, production, was, transferred, to, the, royal, gun, factory, the, british, later, established, a, torpedo, experimental, establishment, at, hms, vernon, and, a, production, facility, at, the, royal, naval, torpedo, factory, greenock, in, 1910, these, are, now, closed, whitehead, opened, a, new, factory, adjacent, to, portland, harbour, england, in, 1890, which, continued, making, torpedoes, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, because, orders, from, the, rn, were, not, as, large, as, expected, torpedoes, were, mostly, exported, a, series, of, devices, was, produced, at, rijeka, with, diameters, from, 14, in, 36, cm, upward, the, largest, whitehead, torpedo, was, 18, in, 46, cm, in, diameter, and, 19, ft, 5, 8, m, long, made, of, polished, steel, or, phosphor, bronze, with, a, 200, pound, 91, kg, gun, cotton, warhead, it, was, propelled, by, a, three, cylinder, brotherhood, radial, engine, using, compressed, air, at, around, 1, 300, psi, 9, 0, mpa, and, driving, two, contra, rotating, propellers, and, was, designed, to, self, regulate, its, course, and, depth, as, far, as, possible, by, 1881, nearly, 1, 500, torpedoes, had, been, produced, whitehead, also, opened, a, factory, at, st, tropez, in, 1890, that, exported, torpedoes, to, brazil, the, netherlands, turkey, and, greece, whitehead, purchased, rights, to, the, gyroscope, of, ludwig, obry, in, 1888, but, it, was, not, sufficiently, accurate, so, in, 1890, he, purchased, a, better, design, to, improve, control, of, his, designs, which, came, to, be, called, the, devil, s, device, the, firm, of, l, schwartzkopff, in, germany, also, produced, torpedoes, and, exported, them, to, russia, japan, and, spain, in, 1885, britain, ordered, a, batch, of, 50, as, torpedo, production, at, home, and, rijeka, could, not, meet, demand, by, world, war, i, whitehead, s, torpedo, remained, a, worldwide, success, and, his, company, was, able, to, maintain, a, monopoly, on, torpedo, production, by, that, point, his, torpedo, had, grown, to, a, diameter, of, 18, inches, with, a, maximum, speed, of, 30, 5, knots, 56, 5, km, h, 35, 1, mph, with, a, warhead, weighing, 170, pounds, 77, kg, whitehead, faced, competition, from, the, american, lieutenant, commander, john, a, howell, whose, design, driven, by, a, flywheel, was, simpler, and, cheaper, it, was, produced, from, 1885, to, 1895, and, it, ran, straight, leaving, no, wake, a, torpedo, test, station, was, set, up, in, rhode, island, in, 1870, the, howell, torpedo, was, the, only, united, states, navy, model, until, an, american, company, bliss, and, williams, secured, manufacturing, rights, to, produce, whitehead, torpedoes, these, were, put, into, service, for, the, u, s, navy, in, 1892, five, varieties, were, produced, all, 18, inch, diameter, the, royal, navy, introduced, the, brotherhood, wet, heater, engine, in, 1907, with, the, 18, in, mk, vii, vii, which, greatly, increased, the, speed, and, or, range, over, compressed, air, engines, and, wet, heater, type, engines, became, the, standard, in, many, major, navies, up, to, and, during, the, second, world, war, ships, of, the, line, were, superseded, by, ironclads, large, steam, powered, ships, with, heavy, gun, armament, and, heavy, armor, in, the, mid, 19th, century, ultimately, this, line, of, development, led, to, the, dreadnought, category, of, all, big, gun, battleships, starting, with, hms, dreadnought, although, these, ships, were, incredibly, powerful, the, new, weight, of, armor, slowed, them, down, and, the, huge, guns, needed, to, penetrate, that, armor, fired, at, very, slow, rates, the, development, of, torpedoes, allowed, for, the, possibility, that, small, and, fast, vessels, could, credibly, threaten, if, not, sink, even, the, most, powerful, battleships, while, such, attacks, would, carry, enormous, risks, to, the, attacking, boats, and, their, crews, which, would, likely, need, to, expose, themselves, to, artillery, fire, which, their, small, vessels, were, not, designed, to, withstand, this, was, offset, by, the, ability, to, construct, large, numbers, of, small, vessels, far, more, quickly, and, for, a, much, lower, unit, cost, compared, to, a, capital, ship, the, first, boat, designed, to, fire, the, self, propelled, whitehead, torpedo, was, hms, lightning, completed, in, 1877, the, french, navy, followed, suit, in, 1878, with, torpilleur, no, 1, launched, in, 1878, though, she, had, been, ordered, in, 1875, the, first, torpedo, boats, were, built, at, the, shipyards, of, sir, john, thornycroft, and, gained, recognition, for, their, effectiveness, at, the, same, time, inventors, were, working, on, building, a, guided, torpedo, prototypes, were, built, by, john, ericsson, john, louis, lay, and, victor, von, scheliha, but, the, first, practical, guided, missile, was, patented, by, louis, brennan, an, emigre, to, australia, in, 1877, it, was, designed, to, run, at, a, consistent, depth, of, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, and, was, fitted, with, an, indicator, mast, that, just, broke, the, surface, of, the, water, at, night, the, mast, had, a, small, light, only, visible, from, the, rear, two, steel, drums, were, mounted, one, behind, the, other, inside, the, torpedo, each, carrying, several, thousand, yards, of, high, tensile, steel, wire, the, drums, connected, via, a, differential, gear, to, twin, contra, rotating, propellers, if, one, drum, was, rotated, faster, than, the, other, then, the, rudder, was, activated, the, other, ends, of, the, wires, were, connected, to, steam, powered, winding, engines, which, were, arranged, so, that, speeds, could, be, varied, within, fine, limits, giving, sensitive, steering, control, for, the, torpedo, the, torpedo, attained, a, speed, of, 20, knots, 37, km, h, 23, mph, using, a, wire, 1, 0, millimetre, 0, 04, in, in, diameter, but, later, this, was, changed, to, 1, 8, mm, 0, 07, in, to, increase, the, speed, to, 27, knots, 50, km, h, 31, mph, the, torpedo, was, fitted, with, elevators, controlled, by, a, depth, keeping, mechanism, and, the, fore, and, aft, rudders, operated, by, the, differential, between, the, drums, brennan, traveled, to, britain, where, the, admiralty, examined, the, torpedo, and, found, it, unsuitable, for, shipboard, use, however, the, war, office, proved, more, amenable, and, in, early, august, 1881, a, special, royal, engineer, committee, was, instructed, to, inspect, the, torpedo, at, chatham, and, report, back, directly, to, the, secretary, of, state, for, war, hugh, childers, the, report, strongly, recommended, that, an, improved, model, be, built, at, government, expense, in, 1883, an, agreement, was, reached, between, the, brennan, torpedo, company, and, the, government, the, newly, appointed, inspector, general, of, fortifications, in, england, sir, andrew, clarke, appreciated, the, value, of, the, torpedo, and, in, spring, 1883, an, experimental, station, was, established, at, garrison, point, fort, sheerness, on, the, river, medway, and, a, workshop, for, brennan, was, set, up, at, the, chatham, barracks, the, home, of, the, royal, engineers, between, 1883, and, 1885, the, royal, engineers, held, trials, and, in, 1886, the, torpedo, was, recommended, for, adoption, as, a, harbor, defense, torpedo, it, was, used, throughout, the, british, empire, for, more, than, fifteen, years, the, royal, navy, frigate, hms, shah, was, the, first, naval, vessel, to, fire, a, self, propelled, torpedo, in, anger, during, the, battle, of, pacocha, against, rebel, peruvian, ironclad, hu, scar, on, 29, may, 1877, the, peruvian, ship, successfully, outran, the, device, on, 16, january, 1878, the, turkish, steamer, intibah, became, the, first, vessel, to, be, sunk, by, self, propelled, torpedoes, launched, from, torpedo, boats, operating, from, the, tender, velikiy, knyaz, konstantin, under, the, command, of, stepan, osipovich, makarov, during, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1877, 78, in, another, early, use, of, the, torpedo, during, the, war, of, the, pacific, the, peruvian, ironclad, hu, scar, commanded, by, captain, miguel, grau, attacked, the, chilean, corvette, abtao, on, 28, august, 1879, at, antofagasta, with, a, self, propelled, lay, torpedo, only, to, have, it, reverse, course, the, ship, huascar, was, saved, when, an, officer, jumped, overboard, to, divert, it, the, chilean, ironclad, blanco, encalada, was, sunk, on, 23, april, 1891, by, a, self, propelled, torpedo, from, the, almirante, lynch, during, the, chilean, civil, war, of, 1891, becoming, the, first, ironclad, warship, sunk, by, this, weapon, the, chinese, turret, ship, dingyuan, was, purportedly, hit, and, disabled, by, a, torpedo, after, numerous, attacks, by, japanese, torpedo, boats, during, the, first, sino, japanese, war, in, 1894, at, this, time, torpedo, attacks, were, still, very, close, range, and, very, dangerous, to, the, attackers, several, western, sources, reported, that, the, qing, dynasty, imperial, chinese, military, under, the, direction, of, li, hongzhang, acquired, electric, torpedoes, which, they, deployed, in, numerous, waterways, along, with, fortresses, and, numerous, other, modern, military, weapons, acquired, by, china, at, the, tientsin, arsenal, in, 1876, the, chinese, developed, the, capacity, to, manufacture, these, electric, torpedoes, on, their, own, although, a, form, of, chinese, art, the, nianhua, depict, such, torpedoes, being, used, against, russian, ships, during, the, boxer, rebellion, whether, they, were, actually, used, in, battle, against, them, is, undocumented, and, unknown, the, russo, japanese, war, 1904, 1905, was, the, first, great, war, of, the, 20th, century, during, the, war, the, imperial, russian, and, imperial, japanese, navies, launched, nearly, 300, torpedoes, at, each, other, all, of, them, of, the, self, propelled, automotive, type, the, deployment, of, these, new, underwater, weapons, resulted, in, one, battleship, two, armored, cruisers, and, two, destroyers, being, sunk, in, action, with, the, remainder, of, the, roughly, 80, warships, being, sunk, by, the, more, conventional, methods, of, gunfire, mines, and, scuttling, on, 27, may, 1905, during, the, battle, of, tsushima, admiral, rozhestvensky, s, flagship, the, battleship, knyaz, suvorov, had, been, gunned, to, a, wreck, by, admiral, t, g, s, 12, inch, gunned, battleline, with, the, russians, sunk, and, scattering, t, g, prepared, for, pursuit, and, while, doing, so, ordered, his, torpedo, boat, destroyers, tbds, mostly, referred, to, as, just, destroyers, in, most, written, accounts, to, finish, off, the, russian, battleship, knyaz, suvorov, was, set, upon, by, 17, torpedo, firing, warships, ten, of, which, were, destroyers, and, four, torpedo, boats, twenty, one, torpedoes, were, launched, at, the, pre, dreadnought, and, three, struck, home, one, fired, from, the, destroyer, murasame, and, two, from, torpedo, boats, no, 72, and, no, 75, the, flagship, slipped, under, the, waves, shortly, thereafter, taking, over, 900, men, with, her, to, the, bottom, on, december, 9, 1912, the, greek, submarine, dolphin, launched, a, torpedo, against, the, ottoman, cruiser, medjidieh, the, end, of, the, russo, japanese, war, fuelled, new, theories, and, the, idea, of, dropping, lightweight, torpedoes, from, aircraft, was, conceived, in, the, early, 1910s, by, bradley, a, fiske, an, officer, in, the, united, states, navy, awarded, a, patent, in, 1912, fiske, worked, out, the, mechanics, of, carrying, and, releasing, the, aerial, torpedo, from, a, bomber, and, defined, tactics, that, included, a, night, time, approach, so, that, the, target, ship, would, be, less, able, to, defend, itself, fiske, determined, that, the, notional, torpedo, bomber, should, descend, rapidly, in, a, sharp, spiral, to, evade, enemy, guns, then, when, about, 10, to, 20, feet, 3, to, 6, m, above, the, water, the, aircraft, would, straighten, its, flight, long, enough, to, line, up, with, the, torpedo, s, intended, path, the, aircraft, would, release, the, torpedo, at, a, distance, of, 1, 500, to, 2, 000, yards, 1, 400, to, 1, 800, m, from, the, target, fiske, reported, in, 1915, that, using, this, method, enemy, fleets, could, be, attacked, within, their, harbors, if, there, was, enough, room, for, the, torpedo, track, meanwhile, the, royal, naval, air, service, began, actively, experimenting, with, this, possibility, the, first, successful, aerial, torpedo, drop, was, performed, by, gordon, bell, in, 1914, dropping, a, whitehead, torpedo, from, a, short, s, 64, seaplane, the, success, of, these, experiments, led, to, the, construction, of, the, first, purpose, built, operational, torpedo, aircraft, the, short, type, 184, built, in, 1915, an, order, for, ten, aircraft, was, placed, and, 936, aircraft, were, built, by, ten, different, british, aircraft, companies, during, the, first, world, war, the, two, prototype, aircraft, were, embarked, upon, hms, ben, my, chree, which, sailed, for, the, aegean, on, 21, march, 1915, to, take, part, in, the, gallipoli, campaign, on, 12, august, 1915, one, of, these, piloted, by, flight, commander, charles, edmonds, was, the, first, aircraft, in, the, world, to, attack, an, enemy, ship, with, an, air, launched, torpedo, on, 17, august, 1915, flight, commander, edmonds, torpedoed, and, sank, an, ottoman, transport, ship, a, few, miles, north, of, the, dardanelles, his, formation, colleague, flight, lieutenant, g, b, dacre, was, forced, to, land, on, the, water, owing, to, engine, trouble, but, seeing, an, enemy, tug, close, by, taxied, up, to, it, and, released, his, torpedo, sinking, the, tug, without, the, weight, of, the, torpedo, dacre, was, able, to, take, off, and, return, to, ben, my, chree, torpedoes, were, widely, used, in, world, war, i, both, against, shipping, and, against, submarines, germany, disrupted, the, supply, lines, to, britain, largely, by, use, of, submarine, torpedoes, though, submarines, also, extensively, used, guns, britain, and, its, allies, also, used, torpedoes, throughout, the, war, u, boats, themselves, were, often, targeted, twenty, being, sunk, by, torpedo, two, royal, italian, navy, torpedo, boats, scored, a, success, against, an, austrian, hungarian, squadron, sinking, the, battleship, sms, szent, istv, n, with, two, torpedoes, the, royal, navy, had, been, experimenting, with, ways, to, further, increase, the, range, of, torpedoes, during, world, war, 1, using, pure, oxygen, instead, of, compressed, air, this, work, ultimately, leading, to, the, development, of, the, oxygen, enriched, air, 24, 5, in, mk, i, intended, originally, for, the, g3, class, battlecruisers, and, n3, class, battleships, of, 1921, both, being, cancelled, due, to, the, washington, naval, treaty, initially, the, imperial, japanese, navy, purchased, whitehead, or, schwartzkopf, torpedoes, but, by, 1917, like, the, royal, navy, they, were, conducting, experiments, with, pure, oxygen, instead, of, compressed, air, because, of, explosions, they, abandoned, the, experiments, but, resumed, them, in, 1926, and, by, 1933, had, a, working, torpedo, they, also, used, conventional, wet, heater, torpedoes, in, the, inter, war, years, financial, stringency, caused, nearly, all, navies, to, skimp, on, testing, their, torpedoes, only, the, british, and, japanese, had, fully, tested, new, technologies, for, torpedoes, in, particular, the, type, 93, nicknamed, long, lance, postwar, by, the, us, official, historian, samuel, e, morison, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, unreliable, torpedoes, caused, many, problems, for, the, american, submarine, force, in, the, early, years, of, the, war, primarily, in, the, pacific, theater, one, possible, exception, to, the, pre, war, neglect, of, torpedo, development, was, the, 45, cm, caliber, 1931, premiered, japanese, type, 91, torpedo, the, sole, aerial, torpedo, koku, gyorai, developed, and, brought, into, service, by, the, japanese, empire, before, the, war, the, type, 91, had, an, advanced, pid, controller, and, jettisonable, wooden, kyoban, aerial, stabilizing, surfaces, which, released, upon, entering, the, water, making, it, a, formidable, anti, ship, weapon, nazi, germany, considered, manufacturing, it, as, the, luftorpedo, lt, 850, after, august, 1942, the, royal, navy, s, 24, 5, inch, oxygen, enriched, air, torpedo, saw, service, in, the, two, nelson, class, battleships, although, by, world, war, ii, the, use, of, enriched, oxygen, had, been, discontinued, due, to, safety, concerns, in, the, final, phase, of, the, action, against, bismarck, rodney, fired, a, pair, of, 24, 5, inch, torpedoes, from, her, port, side, tube, and, claimed, one, hit, according, to, ludovic, kennedy, if, true, the, only, instance, in, history, of, one, battleship, torpedoing, another, the, royal, navy, continued, the, development, of, oxygen, enriched, air, torpedoes, with, the, 21, in, mk, vii, of, the, 1920s, designed, for, the, county, class, cruisers, although, once, again, these, were, converted, to, run, on, normal, air, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, around, this, time, too, the, royal, navy, were, perfecting, the, brotherhood, burner, cycle, engine, which, offered, a, performance, as, good, as, the, oxygen, enriched, air, engine, but, without, the, issues, arising, from, the, oxygen, equipment, and, which, was, first, used, in, the, extremely, successful, and, long, lived, 21, in, mk, viii, torpedo, of, 1925, this, torpedo, served, throughout, ww, ii, with, 3, 732, being, fired, by, september, 1944, and, is, still, in, limited, service, in, the, 21st, century, the, improved, mark, viii, was, used, in, two, particularly, notable, incidents, on, 6, february, 1945, the, only, intentional, wartime, sinking, of, one, submarine, by, another, while, both, were, submerged, took, place, when, hms, venturer, sank, the, german, submarine, u, 864, with, four, mark, viii, torpedoes, and, on, 2, may, 1982, when, the, royal, navy, submarine, hms, conqueror, sank, the, argentine, cruiser, ara, general, belgrano, with, two, mark, viii, torpedoes, during, the, falklands, war, this, is, the, only, sinking, of, a, surface, ship, by, a, nuclear, powered, submarine, in, wartime, and, the, second, of, three, sinkings, of, a, surface, ship, by, any, submarine, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, other, two, sinkings, were, of, the, indian, frigate, ins, khukri, and, the, south, korean, corvette, roks, cheonan, many, classes, of, surface, ships, submarines, and, aircraft, were, armed, with, torpedoes, naval, strategy, at, the, time, was, to, use, torpedoes, launched, from, submarines, or, warships, against, enemy, warships, in, a, fleet, action, on, the, high, seas, there, were, concerns, torpedoes, would, be, ineffective, against, warships, heavy, armor, an, answer, to, this, was, to, detonate, torpedoes, underneath, a, ship, badly, damaging, its, keel, and, the, other, structural, members, in, the, hull, commonly, called, breaking, its, back, this, was, demonstrated, by, magnetic, influence, mines, in, world, war, i, the, torpedo, would, be, set, to, run, at, a, depth, just, beneath, the, ship, relying, on, a, magnetic, exploder, to, activate, at, the, appropriate, time, germany, britain, and, the, u, s, independently, devised, ways, to, do, this, german, and, american, torpedoes, however, suffered, problems, with, their, depth, keeping, mechanisms, coupled, with, faults, in, magnetic, pistols, shared, by, all, designs, inadequate, testing, had, failed, to, reveal, the, effect, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, on, ships, and, exploder, mechanisms, which, resulted, in, premature, detonation, the, kriegsmarine, and, royal, navy, promptly, identified, and, eliminated, the, problems, in, the, united, states, navy, usn, there, was, an, extended, wrangle, over, the, problems, plaguing, the, mark, 14, torpedo, and, its, mark, 6, exploder, cursory, trials, had, allowed, bad, designs, to, enter, service, both, the, navy, bureau, of, ordnance, and, the, united, states, congress, were, too, busy, protecting, their, interests, to, correct, the, errors, and, fully, functioning, torpedoes, only, became, available, to, the, usn, twenty, one, months, into, the, pacific, war, british, submarines, used, torpedoes, to, interdict, the, axis, supply, shipping, to, north, africa, while, fleet, air, arm, swordfish, sank, three, italian, battleships, at, taranto, by, a, torpedo, and, after, a, mistaken, but, abortive, attack, on, sheffield, scored, one, crucial, hit, in, the, hunt, for, the, german, battleship, bismarck, large, tonnages, of, merchant, shipping, were, sunk, by, submarines, with, torpedoes, in, both, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, and, the, pacific, war, torpedo, boats, such, as, mtbs, pt, boats, or, s, boats, enabled, the, relatively, small, but, fast, craft, to, carry, enough, firepower, in, theory, to, destroy, a, larger, ship, though, this, rarely, occurred, in, practice, the, largest, warship, sunk, by, torpedoes, from, small, craft, in, world, war, ii, was, the, british, cruiser, manchester, sunk, by, italian, mas, boats, on, the, night, of, 12, 13, august, 1942, during, operation, pedestal, destroyers, of, all, navies, were, also, armed, with, torpedoes, to, attack, larger, ships, in, the, battle, off, samar, destroyer, torpedoes, from, the, escorts, of, the, american, task, force, taffy, 3, showed, effectiveness, at, defeating, armor, damage, and, confusion, caused, by, torpedo, attacks, were, instrumental, in, beating, back, a, superior, japanese, force, of, battleships, and, cruisers, in, the, battle, of, the, north, cape, in, december, 1943, torpedo, hits, from, british, destroyers, savage, and, saumarez, slowed, the, german, battleship, scharnhorst, enough, for, the, british, battleship, duke, of, york, to, catch, and, sink, her, and, in, may, 1945, the, british, 26th, destroyer, flotilla, coincidentally, led, by, saumarez, again, ambushed, and, sank, japanese, heavy, cruiser, haguro, during, world, war, ii, hedy, lamarr, and, composer, george, antheil, developed, a, radio, guidance, system, for, allied, torpedoes, it, intended, to, use, frequency, hopping, technology, to, defeat, the, threat, of, jamming, by, the, axis, powers, as, radio, guidance, had, been, abandoned, some, years, earlier, it, was, not, pursued, although, the, us, navy, never, adopted, the, technology, it, did, in, the, 1960s, investigate, various, spread, spectrum, techniques, spread, spectrum, techniques, are, incorporated, into, bluetooth, technology, and, are, similar, to, methods, used, in, legacy, versions, of, wi, fi, this, work, led, to, their, induction, into, the, national, inventors, hall, of, fame, in, 2014, because, of, improved, submarine, strength, and, speed, torpedoes, had, to, be, given, improved, warheads, and, better, motors, during, the, cold, war, torpedoes, were, an, important, asset, with, the, advent, of, nuclear, powered, submarines, which, did, not, have, to, surface, often, particularly, those, carrying, strategic, nuclear, missiles, several, navies, have, launched, torpedo, strikes, since, world, war, ii, including, the, whitehead, torpedo, of, 1866, the, first, successful, self, propelled, torpedo, used, compressed, air, as, its, energy, source, the, air, was, stored, at, pressures, of, up, to, 2, 55, mpa, 370, psi, and, fed, to, a, piston, engine, that, turned, a, single, propeller, at, about, 100, rpm, it, could, travel, about, 180, metres, 200, yd, at, an, average, speed, of, 6, 5, knots, 12, 0, km, h, the, speed, and, range, of, later, models, were, improved, by, increasing, the, pressure, of, the, stored, air, in, 1906, whitehead, built, torpedoes, that, could, cover, nearly, 1, 000, metres, 1, 100, yd, at, an, average, speed, of, 35, knots, 65, km, h, at, higher, pressures, the, adiabatic, cooling, experienced, by, the, air, as, it, expanded, in, the, engine, caused, icing, problems, this, drawback, was, remedied, by, heating, the, air, with, seawater, before, it, was, fed, to, the, engine, which, increased, engine, performance, further, because, the, air, expanded, even, more, after, heating, this, was, the, principle, used, by, the, brotherhood, engine, passing, the, air, into, an, engine, led, to, the, idea, of, injecting, a, liquid, fuel, like, kerosene, into, the, compressed, air, and, igniting, it, in, this, manner, the, air, is, heated, more, and, expands, even, further, and, the, burned, propellant, adds, more, gas, to, drive, the, engine, construction, of, such, heated, torpedoes, started, circa, 1904, by, whitehead, s, company, a, further, improvement, was, the, use, of, water, to, cool, the, combustion, chamber, of, the, fuel, burning, torpedo, this, not, only, solved, heating, problems, so, more, fuel, could, be, burned, but, also, allowed, additional, power, to, be, generated, by, feeding, the, resulting, steam, into, the, engine, together, with, the, combustion, products, torpedoes, with, such, a, propulsion, system, became, known, as, wet, heaters, while, heated, torpedoes, without, steam, generation, were, retrospectively, called, dry, heaters, a, simpler, system, was, introduced, by, the, british, royal, gun, factory, in, 1908, most, torpedoes, used, in, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, were, wet, heaters, the, amount, of, fuel, that, can, be, burned, by, a, torpedo, engine, i, e, wet, engine, is, limited, by, the, amount, of, oxygen, it, can, carry, since, compressed, air, contains, only, about, 21, oxygen, engineers, in, japan, developed, the, type, 93, nicknamed, long, lance, postwar, for, destroyers, and, cruisers, in, the, 1930s, it, used, pure, compressed, oxygen, instead, of, compressed, air, and, had, performance, unmatched, by, any, contemporary, torpedo, in, service, through, the, end, of, world, war, ii, however, oxygen, systems, posed, a, danger, to, ships, carrying, such, torpedoes, under, normal, operation, and, more, so, under, attack, japan, lost, several, cruisers, partly, due, to, catastrophic, secondary, explosions, of, type, 93s, during, the, world, war, ii, germany, experimented, with, hydrogen, peroxide, for, the, same, purpose, the, british, approached, the, problem, of, providing, additional, oxygen, for, the, torpedo, engine, by, the, use, of, oxygen, enriched, air, rather, than, pure, oxygen, up, to, 57, instead, of, the, 21, of, normal, atmospheric, compressed, air, this, significantly, increased, the, range, of, the, torpedo, the, 24, 5, inch, mk, 1, having, a, range, of, 15, 000, yards, 14, 000, m, at, 35, knots, 65, km, h, or, 20, 000, yards, 18, 000, m, at, 30, knots, 56, km, h, with, a, 750, pounds, 340, kg, warhead, there, was, a, general, nervousness, about, the, oxygen, enrichment, equipment, known, for, reasons, of, secrecy, as, no, 1, air, compressor, room, on, board, ships, and, development, shifted, to, the, highly, efficient, brotherhood, burner, cycle, engine, that, used, un, enriched, air, after, the, first, world, war, peter, brotherhood, developed, a, four, cylinder, burner, cycle, engine, which, was, roughly, twice, as, powerful, as, the, older, wet, heater, engine, it, was, first, used, in, the, british, mk, viii, torpedoes, which, were, still, in, service, in, 1982, it, used, a, modified, diesel, cycle, using, a, small, amount, of, paraffin, to, heat, the, incoming, air, which, was, then, compressed, and, further, heated, by, the, piston, and, then, more, fuel, was, injected, it, produced, about, 322, hp, when, introduced, but, by, the, end, of, ww2, was, at, 465, hp, and, there, was, a, proposal, to, fuel, it, with, nitric, acid, when, it, was, projected, to, develop, 750, hp, the, brennan, torpedo, had, two, wires, wound, around, internal, drums, joined, to, the, propellers, shore, based, steam, winches, pulled, the, wires, which, spun, the, internal, drums, and, drove, the, propellers, an, operator, controlled, the, relative, speeds, of, the, winches, providing, guidance, such, systems, were, used, for, coastal, defense, of, the, british, homeland, and, colonies, from, 1887, to, 1903, and, were, purchased, by, and, under, the, control, of, the, army, as, opposed, to, the, navy, speed, was, about, 25, knots, 46, km, h, for, over, 2, 400, m, the, howell, torpedo, used, by, the, us, navy, in, the, late, 19th, century, featured, a, heavy, flywheel, that, had, to, be, spun, up, before, launch, it, was, able, to, travel, about, 400, yards, 370, m, at, 25, knots, 46, km, h, the, howell, had, the, advantage, of, not, leaving, a, trail, of, bubbles, behind, it, unlike, compressed, air, torpedoes, this, gave, the, target, vessel, less, chance, to, detect, and, evade, the, torpedo, and, avoided, giving, away, the, attacker, s, position, additionally, it, ran, at, a, constant, depth, unlike, whitehead, models, electric, propulsion, systems, avoided, tell, tale, bubbles, john, ericsson, invented, an, electrically, propelled, torpedo, in, 1873, it, was, powered, by, a, cable, from, an, external, power, source, because, batteries, of, the, time, had, insufficient, capacity, the, sims, edison, torpedo, was, similarly, powered, the, nordfelt, torpedo, was, also, electrically, powered, and, was, steered, by, impulses, down, a, trailing, wire, germany, introduced, its, first, battery, powered, torpedo, shortly, before, world, war, ii, the, g7e, it, was, slower, and, had, a, shorter, range, than, the, conventional, g7a, but, was, wakeless, and, much, cheaper, its, lead, acid, rechargeable, battery, was, sensitive, to, shock, required, frequent, maintenance, before, use, and, required, preheating, for, best, performance, the, experimental, g7es, an, enhancement, of, the, g7e, used, primary, cells, the, united, states, had, an, electric, design, the, mark, 18, largely, copied, from, the, german, torpedo, although, with, improved, batteries, as, well, as, fido, an, air, dropped, acoustic, homing, torpedo, for, anti, submarine, use, modern, electric, torpedoes, such, as, the, mark, 24, tigerfish, the, black, shark, or, dm2, series, commonly, use, silver, oxide, batteries, that, need, no, maintenance, so, torpedoes, can, be, stored, for, years, without, losing, performance, several, experimental, rocket, propelled, torpedoes, were, tried, soon, after, whitehead, s, invention, but, were, not, successful, rocket, propulsion, has, been, implemented, successfully, by, the, soviet, union, for, example, in, the, va, 111, shkval, and, has, been, recently, revived, in, russian, and, german, torpedoes, as, it, is, especially, suitable, for, supercavitating, devices, modern, torpedoes, use, a, variety, of, propellants, including, electric, batteries, as, with, the, french, f21, torpedo, or, italian, black, shark, monopropellants, e, g, otto, fuel, ii, as, with, the, us, mark, 48, torpedo, and, bipropellants, e, g, hydrogen, peroxide, plus, kerosene, as, with, the, swedish, torped, 62, sulfur, hexafluoride, plus, lithium, as, with, the, us, mark, 50, torpedo, or, otto, fuel, ii, plus, hydroxyl, ammonium, perchlorate, as, with, the, british, spearfish, torpedo, the, first, of, whitehead, s, torpedoes, had, a, single, propeller, and, needed, a, large, vane, to, stop, it, spinning, about, its, longitudinal, axis, not, long, afterward, the, idea, of, contra, rotating, propellers, was, introduced, to, avoid, the, need, for, the, vane, the, three, bladed, propeller, came, in, 1893, and, the, four, bladed, one, in, 1897, to, minimize, noise, today, s, torpedoes, often, use, pump, jets, some, torpedoes, like, the, russian, va, 111, shkval, iranian, hoot, and, german, unterwasserlaufk, rper, barracuda, use, supercavitation, to, increase, speed, to, over, 200, knots, 370, km, h, torpedoes, that, don, t, use, supercavitation, such, as, the, american, mark, 48, and, british, spearfish, are, limited, to, under, 100, kn, 120, mph, 190, km, h, though, manufacturers, and, the, military, don, t, always, release, exact, figures, torpedoes, may, be, aimed, at, the, target, and, fired, unguided, similarly, to, a, traditional, artillery, shell, or, they, may, be, guided, onto, the, target, they, may, be, guided, autonomously, towards, the, target, by, some, procedure, e, g, sound, homing, or, by, the, operator, typically, via, commands, sent, over, a, signal, carrying, cable, wire, guidance, the, victorian, era, brennan, torpedo, could, be, steered, onto, its, target, by, varying, the, relative, speeds, of, its, propulsion, cables, however, the, brennan, required, a, substantial, infrastructure, and, was, not, suitable, for, shipboard, use, therefore, for, the, first, part, of, its, history, the, torpedo, was, guided, only, in, the, sense, that, its, course, could, be, regulated, to, achieve, an, intended, impact, depth, because, of, the, sine, wave, running, path, of, the, whitehead, this, was, a, hit, or, miss, proposition, even, when, everything, worked, correctly, and, through, gyroscopes, a, straight, course, with, such, torpedoes, the, method, of, attack, in, small, torpedo, boats, torpedo, bombers, and, small, submarines, was, to, steer, a, predictable, collision, course, abeam, to, the, target, and, release, the, torpedo, at, the, last, minute, then, veer, away, all, the, time, subject, to, defensive, fire, in, larger, ships, and, submarines, fire, control, calculators, gave, a, wider, engagement, envelope, originally, plotting, tables, in, large, ships, combined, with, specialized, slide, rules, known, in, u, s, service, as, the, banjo, and, is, was, reconciled, the, speed, distance, and, course, of, a, target, with, the, firing, ship, s, speed, and, course, together, with, the, performance, of, its, torpedoes, to, provide, a, firing, solution, by, the, second, world, war, all, sides, had, developed, automatic, electro, mechanical, calculators, exemplified, by, the, u, s, navy, s, torpedo, data, computer, submarine, commanders, were, still, expected, to, be, able, to, calculate, a, firing, solution, by, hand, as, a, backup, against, mechanical, failure, and, because, many, submarines, existed, at, the, start, of, the, war, were, not, equipped, with, a, tdc, most, could, keep, the, picture, in, their, heads, and, do, much, of, the, calculations, simple, trigonometry, mentally, from, extensive, training, against, high, value, targets, and, multiple, targets, submarines, would, launch, a, spread, of, torpedoes, to, increase, the, probability, of, success, similarly, squadrons, of, torpedo, boats, and, torpedo, bombers, would, attack, together, creating, a, fan, of, torpedoes, across, the, target, s, course, faced, with, such, an, attack, the, prudent, thing, for, a, target, to, do, was, to, turn, to, parallel, the, course, of, the, incoming, torpedo, and, steam, away, from, the, torpedoes, and, the, firer, allowing, the, relatively, short, range, torpedoes, to, use, up, their, fuel, an, alternative, was, to, comb, the, tracks, turning, to, parallel, the, incoming, torpedo, s, course, but, turning, towards, the, torpedoes, the, intention, of, such, a, tactic, was, still, to, minimize, the, size, of, the, target, offered, to, the, torpedoes, but, at, the, same, time, be, able, to, aggressively, engage, the, firer, this, was, the, tactic, advocated, by, critics, of, jellicoe, s, actions, at, jutland, his, caution, at, turning, away, from, the, torpedoes, being, seen, as, the, reason, the, germans, escaped, the, use, of, multiple, torpedoes, to, engage, single, targets, depletes, torpedo, supplies, and, greatly, reduces, a, submarine, s, combat, endurance, endurance, can, be, improved, by, ensuring, a, target, can, be, effectively, engaged, by, a, single, torpedo, which, gave, rise, to, the, guided, torpedo, in, world, war, ii, the, germans, introduced, programmable, pattern, running, torpedoes, which, would, run, a, predetermined, pattern, until, they, either, ran, out, of, fuel, or, hit, something, the, earlier, version, fat, ran, out, after, launch, in, a, straight, line, and, then, weaved, backward, and, forwards, parallel, to, that, initial, course, whilst, the, more, advanced, lut, could, transit, to, a, different, angle, after, launch, and, then, enter, a, more, complex, weaving, pattern, though, luppis, original, design, had, been, rope, guided, torpedoes, were, not, wire, guided, until, the, 1960s, during, the, first, world, war, the, u, s, navy, evaluated, a, radio, controlled, torpedo, launched, from, a, surface, ship, called, the, hammond, torpedo, a, later, version, tested, in, the, 1930s, was, claimed, to, have, an, effective, range, of, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, modern, torpedoes, use, an, umbilical, wire, which, nowadays, allows, the, computer, processing, power, of, the, submarine, or, ship, to, be, used, torpedoes, such, as, the, u, s, mark, 48, can, operate, in, a, variety, of, modes, increasing, tactical, flexibility, homing, fire, and, forget, torpedoes, can, use, passive, or, active, guidance, or, a, combination, of, both, passive, acoustic, torpedoes, home, in, on, emissions, from, a, target, active, acoustic, torpedoes, home, in, on, the, reflection, of, a, signal, or, ping, from, the, torpedo, or, its, parent, vehicle, this, has, the, disadvantage, of, giving, away, the, presence, of, the, torpedo, in, semi, active, mode, a, torpedo, can, be, fired, to, the, last, known, position, or, calculated, position, of, a, target, which, is, then, acoustically, illuminated, pinged, once, the, torpedo, is, within, attack, range, later, in, the, second, world, war, torpedoes, were, given, acoustic, homing, guidance, systems, with, the, american, mark, 24, mine, and, mark, 27, torpedo, and, the, german, g7es, torpedo, pattern, following, and, wake, homing, torpedoes, were, also, developed, acoustic, homing, formed, the, basis, for, torpedo, guidance, after, the, second, world, war, the, homing, systems, for, torpedoes, are, generally, acoustic, though, there, have, been, other, target, sensor, types, used, a, ship, s, acoustic, signature, is, not, the, only, emission, a, torpedo, can, home, in, on, to, engage, u, s, supercarriers, the, soviet, union, developed, the, 53, 65, wake, homing, torpedo, as, standard, acoustic, lures, can, t, distract, a, wake, homing, torpedo, the, us, navy, has, installed, the, surface, ship, torpedo, defense, on, aircraft, carriers, that, use, a, countermeasure, anti, torpedo, to, home, in, on, and, destroy, the, attacking, torpedo, the, warhead, is, generally, some, form, of, aluminized, explosive, because, the, sustained, explosive, pulse, produced, by, the, powdered, aluminum, is, particularly, destructive, against, underwater, targets, torpex, was, popular, until, the, 1950s, but, has, been, superseded, by, pbx, compositions, nuclear, torpedoes, have, also, been, developed, e, g, the, mark, 45, torpedo, in, lightweight, antisubmarine, torpedoes, designed, to, penetrate, submarine, hulls, a, shaped, charge, can, be, used, detonation, can, be, triggered, by, direct, contact, with, the, target, or, by, a, proximity, fuze, incorporating, sonar, and, or, magnetic, sensors, when, a, torpedo, with, a, contact, fuze, strikes, the, side, of, the, target, hull, the, resulting, explosion, creates, a, bubble, of, expanding, gas, the, walls, of, which, move, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, in, water, thus, creating, a, shock, wave, the, side, of, the, bubble, which, is, against, the, hull, rips, away, the, external, plating, creating, a, large, breach, the, bubble, then, collapses, in, on, itself, forcing, a, high, speed, stream, of, water, into, the, breach, which, can, destroy, bulkheads, and, machinery, in, its, path, a, torpedo, fitted, with, a, proximity, fuze, can, be, detonated, directly, under, the, keel, of, a, target, ship, the, explosion, creates, a, gas, bubble, which, may, damage, the, keel, or, underside, plating, of, the, target, however, the, most, destructive, part, of, the, explosion, is, the, upthrust, of, the, gas, bubble, which, will, bodily, lift, the, hull, in, the, water, the, structure, of, the, hull, is, designed, to, resist, downward, rather, than, upward, pressure, causing, severe, strain, in, this, phase, of, the, explosion, when, the, gas, bubble, collapses, the, hull, will, tend, to, fall, into, the, void, in, the, water, creating, a, sagging, effect, finally, the, weakened, hull, will, be, hit, by, the, uprush, of, water, caused, by, the, collapsing, gas, bubble, causing, structural, failure, on, vessels, up, to, the, size, of, a, modern, frigate, this, can, result, in, the, ship, breaking, in, two, and, sinking, this, effect, is, likely, to, prove, less, catastrophic, on, a, much, larger, hull, for, instance, that, of, an, aircraft, carrier, the, damage, that, may, be, caused, by, a, torpedo, depends, on, the, shock, factor, value, a, combination, of, the, initial, strength, of, the, explosion, and, the, distance, between, the, target, and, the, detonation, when, taken, about, ship, hull, plating, the, term, hull, shock, factor, hsf, is, used, while, keel, damage, is, termed, keel, shock, factor, ksf, if, the, explosion, is, directly, underneath, the, keel, then, hsf, is, equal, to, ksf, but, explosions, that, are, not, directly, underneath, the, ship, will, have, a, lower, value, of, ksf, usually, only, created, by, contact, detonation, direct, damage, is, a, hole, blown, in, the, ship, among, the, crew, fragmentation, wounds, are, the, most, common, form, of, injury, flooding, typically, occurs, in, one, or, two, main, watertight, compartments, which, can, sink, smaller, ships, or, disable, larger, ones, the, bubble, jet, effect, occurs, when, a, mine, or, torpedo, detonates, in, the, water, a, short, distance, away, from, the, targeted, ship, the, explosion, creates, a, bubble, in, the, water, and, due, to, the, pressure, difference, the, bubble, will, collapse, from, the, bottom, the, bubble, is, buoyant, and, so, it, rises, towards, the, surface, if, the, bubble, reaches, the, surface, as, it, collapses, it, can, create, a, pillar, of, water, that, can, go, over, a, hundred, meters, into, the, air, a, columnar, plume, if, conditions, are, right, and, the, bubble, collapses, onto, the, ship, s, hull, the, damage, to, the, ship, can, be, extremely, serious, the, collapsing, bubble, forms, a, high, energy, jet, that, can, break, a, meter, wide, hole, straight, through, the, ship, flooding, one, or, more, compartments, and, is, capable, of, breaking, smaller, ships, apart, the, crew, in, the, areas, hit, by, the, pillar, are, usually, killed, instantly, other, damage, is, usually, limited, the, baengnyeong, incident, in, which, roks, cheonan, broke, in, half, and, sank, off, the, coast, south, korea, in, 2010, was, caused, by, the, bubble, jet, effect, according, to, an, international, investigation, if, the, torpedo, detonates, at, a, distance, from, the, ship, and, especially, under, the, keel, the, change, in, water, pressure, causes, the, ship, to, resonate, this, is, frequently, the, most, deadly, type, of, explosion, if, it, is, strong, enough, the, whole, ship, is, dangerously, shaken, and, everything, on, board, is, tossed, around, engines, rip, from, their, beds, cables, from, their, holders, etc, a, badly, shaken, ship, usually, sinks, quickly, with, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, small, leaks, all, over, the, ship, and, no, way, to, power, the, pumps, the, crew, fares, no, better, as, the, violent, shaking, tosses, them, around, this, shaking, is, powerful, enough, to, cause, disabling, injury, to, knees, and, other, joints, in, the, body, particularly, if, the, affected, person, stands, on, surfaces, connected, directly, to, the, hull, such, as, steel, decks, the, resulting, gas, cavitation, and, shock, front, differential, over, the, width, of, the, human, body, is, sufficient, to, stun, or, kill, divers, control, surfaces, are, essential, for, a, torpedo, to, maintain, its, course, and, depth, a, homing, torpedo, also, needs, to, be, able, to, outmaneuver, a, target, good, hydrodynamics, are, needed, for, it, to, attain, high, speed, efficiently, and, also, to, give, a, long, range, since, the, torpedo, has, limited, stored, energy, torpedoes, may, be, launched, from, submarines, surface, ships, helicopters, and, fixed, wing, aircraft, unmanned, naval, mines, and, naval, fortresses, they, are, also, used, in, conjunction, with, other, weapons, for, example, the, mark, 46, torpedo, used, by, the, united, states, is, the, warhead, section, of, the, asroc, anti, submarine, rocket, and, the, captor, mine, capsulated, torpedo, is, a, submerged, sensor, platform, which, releases, a, torpedo, when, a, hostile, contact, is, detected, originally, whitehead, torpedoes, were, intended, for, launch, underwater, and, the, firm, was, upset, when, they, found, out, the, british, were, launching, them, above, water, as, they, considered, their, torpedoes, too, delicate, for, this, however, the, torpedoes, survived, the, launch, tubes, could, be, fitted, in, a, ship, s, bow, which, weakened, it, for, ramming, or, on, the, broadside, this, introduced, problems, because, of, water, flow, twisting, the, torpedo, so, guide, rails, and, sleeves, were, used, to, prevent, it, the, torpedoes, were, originally, ejected, from, the, tubes, by, compressed, air, but, later, slow, burning, gunpowder, was, used, torpedo, boats, originally, used, a, frame, that, dropped, the, torpedo, into, the, sea, royal, navy, coastal, motor, boats, of, world, war, i, used, a, rear, facing, trough, and, a, cordite, ram, to, push, the, torpedoes, into, the, water, tail, first, they, then, had, to, move, rapidly, out, of, the, way, to, avoid, being, hit, by, their, torpedo, developed, in, the, run, up, to, the, first, world, war, multiple, tube, mounts, initially, twin, later, triple, and, in, ww2, up, to, quintuple, in, some, ships, for, 21, to, 24, in, 53, to, 61, cm, torpedoes, in, rotating, turntable, mounts, appeared, destroyers, could, be, found, with, two, or, three, of, these, mounts, with, between, five, and, twelve, tubes, in, total, the, japanese, went, one, better, covering, their, tube, mounts, with, splinter, protection, and, adding, reloading, gear, both, unlike, any, other, navy, in, the, world, making, them, true, turrets, and, increasing, the, broadside, without, adding, tubes, and, top, hamper, as, the, quadruple, and, quintuple, mounts, did, considering, that, their, type, 93s, were, very, effective, weapons, the, ijn, equipped, their, cruisers, with, torpedoes, the, germans, also, equipped, their, capital, ships, with, torpedoes, smaller, vessels, such, as, pt, boats, carried, their, torpedoes, in, fixed, deck, mounted, tubes, using, compressed, air, these, were, either, aligned, to, fire, forward, or, at, an, offset, angle, from, the, centerline, later, lightweight, mounts, for, 12, 75, in, 32, 4, cm, homing, torpedoes, were, developed, for, anti, submarine, use, consisting, of, triple, launch, tubes, used, on, the, decks, of, ships, these, were, the, 1960, mk, 32, torpedo, launcher, in, the, us, and, part, of, stws, shipborne, torpedo, weapon, system, in, the, uk, later, a, below, decks, launcher, was, used, by, the, rn, this, basic, launch, system, continues, to, be, used, today, with, improved, torpedoes, and, fire, control, systems, modern, submarines, use, either, swim, out, systems, or, a, pulse, of, water, to, discharge, the, torpedo, from, the, tube, both, of, which, have, the, advantage, of, being, significantly, quieter, than, previous, systems, helping, avoid, detection, of, the, firing, from, passive, sonar, earlier, designs, used, a, pulse, of, compressed, air, or, a, hydraulic, ram, early, submarines, when, they, carried, torpedoes, were, fitted, with, a, variety, of, torpedo, launching, mechanisms, in, a, range, of, locations, on, the, deck, in, the, bow, or, stern, amidships, with, some, launch, mechanisms, permitting, the, torpedo, to, be, aimed, over, a, wide, arc, by, world, war, ii, designs, favored, multiple, bow, tubes, and, fewer, or, no, stern, tubes, modern, submarine, bows, are, usually, occupied, by, a, large, sonar, array, necessitating, midships, tubes, angled, outward, while, stern, tubes, have, largely, disappeared, the, first, french, and, russian, submarines, carried, their, torpedoes, externally, in, drzewiecki, drop, collars, these, were, cheaper, than, tubes, but, less, reliable, both, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, experimented, with, external, tubes, in, world, war, ii, external, tubes, offered, a, cheap, and, easy, way, of, increasing, torpedo, capacity, without, radical, redesign, something, neither, had, time, or, resources, to, do, before, nor, early, in, the, war, british, t, class, submarines, carried, up, to, 13, torpedo, tubes, up, to, 5, of, them, external, america, s, use, was, mainly, limited, to, earlier, porpoise, salmon, and, sargo, class, boats, until, the, appearance, of, the, tambor, class, most, american, submarines, only, carried, 4, bow, and, either, 2, or, 4, stern, tubes, something, many, american, submarine, officers, felt, provided, inadequate, firepower, this, problem, was, compounded, by, the, notorious, unreliability, of, the, mark, 14, torpedo, late, in, world, war, ii, the, u, s, adopted, a, 16, in, 41, cm, homing, torpedo, known, as, cutie, for, use, against, escorts, it, was, basically, a, modified, mark, 24, mine, with, wooden, rails, to, allow, firing, from, a, 21, in, 53, cm, torpedo, tube, aerial, torpedoes, may, be, carried, by, fixed, wing, aircraft, helicopters, or, missiles, they, are, launched, from, the, first, two, at, prescribed, speeds, and, altitudes, dropped, from, bomb, bays, or, underwing, hardpoints, although, lightweight, torpedoes, are, fairly, easily, handled, the, transport, and, handling, of, heavyweight, torpedoes, is, difficult, especially, in, the, tight, spaces, in, a, submarine, after, the, second, world, war, some, type, xxi, submarines, were, obtained, from, germany, by, the, united, states, and, britain, one, of, the, main, novel, developments, seen, was, a, mechanical, handling, system, for, torpedoes, such, systems, were, widely, adopted, as, a, result, of, this, discovery, torpedoes, are, launched, in, several, ways, many, navies, have, two, weights, of, torpedoes, in, the, case, of, deck, or, tube, launched, torpedoes, the, diameter, of, the, torpedo, is, a, key, factor, in, determining, the, suitability, of, a, particular, torpedo, to, a, tube, or, launcher, similar, to, the, caliber, of, the, gun, the, size, is, not, quite, as, critical, as, for, a, gun, but, the, diameter, has, become, the, most, common, way, of, classifying, torpedoes, length, weight, and, other, factors, also, contribute, to, compatibility, in, the, case, of, aircraft, launched, torpedoes, the, key, factors, are, weight, provision, of, suitable, attachment, points, and, launch, speed, assisted, torpedoes, are, the, most, recent, development, in, torpedo, design, and, are, normally, engineered, as, an, integrated, package, versions, for, aircraft, and, assisted, launching, have, sometimes, been, based, on, deck, or, tube, launched, versions, and, there, has, been, at, least, one, case, of, a, submarine, torpedo, tube, being, designed, to, fire, an, aircraft, torpedo, as, in, all, munition, design, there, is, a, compromise, between, standardization, which, simplifies, manufacture, and, logistics, and, specialization, which, may, make, the, weapon, significantly, more, effective, small, improvements, in, either, logistics, or, effectiveness, can, translate, into, enormous, operational, advantages, modern, heavyweight, torpedos, generally, launched, from, submarines, and, used, to, attack, both, surface, ships, and, submarines, relatively, older, heavyweight, torpedos, generally, used, to, attack, either, surface, ships, or, submarines, modern, lightweight, torpedos, launched, from, surface, ships, helicopters, and, fixed, wing, aircraft, used, to, attack, submarines, in, april, 2015, the, fizik, ugst, heat, seeking, torpedo, entered, service, to, replace, the, wake, homing, uset, 80, developed, in, the, 1980s, and, the, next, gen, futlyar, entered, service, in, 2017, the, torpedoes, used, by, the, imperial, japanese, navy, world, war, ii, included, the, torpedoes, used, by, the, world, war, ii, kriegsmarine, included, the, torpedoes, used, by, the, world, war, ii, royal, navy, included, the, torpedoes, used, by, the, world, war, ii, united, states, navy, included
