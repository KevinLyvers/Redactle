paddle, battling, stick, bat, beetle, or, club, wooden, or, stone, scrubbing, surfaces, set, up, near, a, water, supply, were, gradually, replaced, by, portable, rub, boards, eventually, factory, made, corrugated, glass, or, metal, washboards, once, clean, the, clothes, were, wrung, out, twisted, to, remove, most, of, the, water, then, they, were, hung, up, on, poles, or, clothes, lines, to, air, dry, or, sometimes, just, spread, out, on, clean, grass, bushes, or, trees, before, the, advent, of, the, washing, machine, laundry, was, often, done, in, a, communal, setting, villages, across, europe, that, could, afford, it, built, a, wash, house, sometimes, known, by, the, french, name, of, lavoir, water, was, channelled, from, a, stream, or, spring, and, fed, into, a, building, possibly, just, a, roof, with, no, walls, this, wash, house, usually, contained, two, basins, one, for, washing, and, the, other, for, rinsing, through, which, the, water, was, constantly, flowing, as, well, as, a, stone, lip, inclined, towards, the, water, against, which, the, wet, laundry, could, be, beaten, such, facilities, were, more, comfortable, and, convenient, than, washing, in, a, watercourse, some, lavoirs, had, the, wash, basins, at, waist, height, although, others, remained, on, the, ground, the, launderers, were, protected, to, some, extent, from, rain, and, their, travel, was, reduced, as, the, facilities, were, usually, at, hand, in, the, village, or, at, the, edge, of, a, town, these, facilities, were, public, and, available, to, all, families, and, usually, used, by, the, entire, village, many, of, these, village, wash, houses, are, still, standing, historic, structures, with, no, obvious, modern, purpose, the, job, of, doing, the, laundry, was, reserved, for, women, who,

pump, indeed, this, tradition, is, reflected, in, the, catalan, idiom, fer, safareig, literally, to, do, the, laundry, which, means, to, gossip, european, cities, also, had, public, wash, houses, the, city, authorities, wanted, to, give, the, poorer, population, who, would, otherwise, not, have, access, to, laundry, facilities, the, opportunity, to, wash, their, clothes, sometimes, these, facilities, were, combined, with, public, baths, see, for, example, baths, and, wash, houses, in, britain, the, aim, was, to, foster, hygiene, and, thus, reduce, outbreaks, of, epidemics, sometimes, large, metal, cauldrons, a, wash, copper, even, when, not, made, of, that, metal, were, filled, with, fresh, water, and, heated, over, a, fire, as, hot, or, boiling, water, is, more, effective, than, cold, in, removing, dirt, a, posser, could, be, used, to, agitate, clothes, in, a, tub, a, related, implement, called, a, washing, dolly, is, a, wooden, stick, or, mallet, with, an, attached, cluster, of, legs, or, pegs, that, moves, the, cloth, through, the, water, the, industrial, revolution, completely, transformed, laundry, technology, christina, hardyment, in, her, history, from, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, argues, that, it, was, the, development, of, domestic, machinery, that, led, to, women, s, liberation, the, mangle, or, wringer, in, american, english, was, developed, in, the, 19th, century, two, long, rollers, in, a, frame, and, a, crank, to, revolve, them, a, laundry, worker, took, sopping, wet, clothing, and, cranked, it, through, the, mangle, compressing, the, cloth, and, expelling, the, excess, water, the, mangle, was, much, quicker, than, hand, twisting, it, was, a, variation, on, the, box, mangle, used, primarily, for, pressing, and, smoothing, cloth, meanwhile, 19th, century, inventors, further, mechanized, the, laundry, process, with, various, hand, operated, washing, machines, to, replace, tedious, hand, rubbing, against, a, washboard, most, involved, turning, a, handle, to, move, paddles, inside, a, tub, then, some, early, 20th, century, machines, used, an, electrically, powered, agitator, many, of, these, washing, machines, were, simply, a, tub, on, legs, with, a, hand, operated, mangle, on, top, later, the, mangle, too, was, electrically, powered, then, replaced, by, a, perforated, double, tub, which, spun, out, the, excess, water, in, a, spin, cycle, laundry, drying, was, also, mechanized, with, clothes, dryers, dryers, were, also, spinning, perforated, tubs, but, they, blew, heated, air, rather, than, water, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, chinese, immigrants, to, the, united, states, and, to, canada, were, well, represented, as, laundry, workers, discrimination, lack, of, english, language,
