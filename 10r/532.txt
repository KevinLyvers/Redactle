a, crossbow, is, a, ranged, weapon, using, an, elastic, launching, device, consisting, of, a, bow, like, assembly, called, a, prod, mounted, horizontally, on, a, main, frame, called, a, tiller, which, is, hand, held, in, a, similar, fashion, to, the, stock, of, a, long, gun, crossbows, shoot, arrow, like, projectiles, called, bolts, or, quarrels, a, person, who, shoots, crossbow, is, called, a, crossbowman, an, arbalister, or, an, arbalist, after, the, arbalest, a, european, crossbow, variant, used, during, the, 12th, century, crossbows, and, bows, use, the, same, elastic, launch, principles, but, differ, in, that, an, archer, using, a, bow, must, draw, and, shoot, in, a, quick, and, smooth, motion, with, limited, or, no, time, for, aiming, while, a, crossbow, s, design, allows, it, to, be, spanned, and, cocked, ready, for, use, at, a, later, time, and, thus, affording, them, unlimited, time, to, aim, when, shooting, bows, the, archer, must, fully, perform, the, draw, holding, the, string, and, arrow, using, various, techniques, while, pulling, it, back, with, arm, and, back, muscles, and, then, either, immediately, shooting, instinctively, without, a, period, of, aiming, or, holding, that, form, while, aiming, both, demand, some, physical, strength, to, do, so, using, bows, suitable, for, warfare, though, this, is, easier, using, lighter, draw, weight, hunting, bows, as, such, their, accurate, and, sustained, use, in, warfare, takes, a, lot, of, practice, crossbows, avoid, these, potential, problems, by, having, trigger, released, cocking, mechanisms, to, maintain, the, tension, on, the, string, once, it, has, been, spanned, drawn, into, its, ready, to, shoot, position, allowing, these, weapons, to, be, carried, cocked, and, ready, and, affording, their, users, time, to, aim, them, this, also, allows, them, to, be, readied, by, someone, assisting, their, users, so, multiple, crossbows, can, be, used, one, after, the, other, while, others, reload, and, ready, them, crossbows, are, spanned, into, their, cocked, positions, using, a, number, of, techniques, and, devices, some, of, which, are, mechanical, and, employ, gear, and, pulley, arrangements, levers, belt, hooks, pulleys, windlasses, and, cranequins, to, overcome, very, high, draw, weight, these, potentially, achieve, better, precision, and, enable, their, effective, use, by, less, familiarised, and, trained, personnel, whereas, the, simple, and, composite, warbows, of, for, example, the, english, and, the, steppe, nomads, require, years, of, training, practice, and, familiarisation, these, advantages, for, the, crossbow, are, somewhat, offset, by, the, longer, time, needed, to, reload, a, crossbow, for, further, shots, with, the, crossbows, with, high, draw, weights, requiring, sophisticated, systems, of, gears, and, pulleys, to, overcome, their, huge, draw, weights, that, are, very, slow, and, rather, awkward, to, employ, on, the, battlefield, medieval, crossbows, were, also, very, inefficient, with, short, shot, stroke, lengths, from, the, string, lock, to, the, release, point, of, their, bolts, along, with, the, slower, speeds, of, their, steel, prods, and, heavy, strings, despite, their, massive, draw, weights, compared, to, bows, though, modern, materials, and, crossbow, designs, overcome, these, shortcomings, when, trying, to, compare, these, weapons, in, their, historic, contexts, a, rough, idea, of, which, weapon, system, was, most, effective, can, be, found, with, a, quick, glimpse, the, successes, of, their, historical, use, this, shows, that, the, composite, bow, systems, of, the, various, steppe, nomads, and, their, imitators, were, successfully, employed, as, primary, weapons, systems, to, conquer, far, more, territory, over, a, much, longer, period, of, time, than, both, the, simple, bow, system, of, the, english, longbow, and, any, sort, of, crossbow, system, at, any, time, anywhere, the, earliest, known, crossbows, were, made, in, the, first, millennium, bc, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, bc, in, ancient, china, and, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, ad, in, greece, as, the, gastraphetes, crossbows, brought, about, a, major, shift, in, the, role, of, projectile, weaponry, in, wars, such, as, during, qin, s, unification, wars, and, later, han, campaigns, against, northern, nomads, and, western, states, the, medieval, european, crossbow, was, called, by, many, names, including, crossbow, itself, most, of, these, names, derived, from, the, word, ballista, an, ancient, greek, torsion, siege, engine, similar, in, appearance, but, different, in, design, principle, in, modern, times, firearms, have, largely, supplanted, bows, and, crossbows, as, weapons, of, war, but, crossbows, remain, widely, used, for, competitive, shooting, sports, and, hunting, and, for, relatively, silent, shooting, a, crossbowman, is, sometimes, called, an, arbalist, or, historically, an, arbalister, arrow, bolt, and, quarrel, are, all, suitable, terms, for, crossbow, projectiles, as, was, vire, historically, the, lath, also, called, the, prod, is, the, bow, of, the, crossbow, according, to, w, f, peterson, the, prod, came, into, usage, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, result, of, mistranslating, rodd, in, a, 16th, century, list, of, crossbow, effects, the, stock, is, the, wooden, body, on, which, the, bow, is, mounted, although, the, medieval, tiller, is, also, used, the, lock, refers, to, the, release, mechanism, including, the, string, sears, trigger, lever, and, housing, a, crossbow, is, essentially, a, bow, mounted, on, an, elongated, frame, called, a, tiller, or, stock, with, a, built, in, mechanism, that, holds, the, drawn, bow, string, as, well, as, a, trigger, mechanism, which, is, used, to, release, the, string, the, chinese, trigger, was, a, mechanism, typically, composed, of, three, cast, bronze, pieces, housed, inside, a, hollow, bronze, enclosure, the, entire, mechanism, is, then, dropped, into, a, carved, slot, within, the, tiller, and, secured, together, by, two, bronze, rods, the, string, catch, nut, is, shaped, like, a, j, because, it, usually, has, a, tall, erect, rear, spine, that, protrudes, above, the, housing, which, serves, the, function, of, both, a, cocking, lever, by, pushing, the, drawn, string, onto, it, and, a, primitive, rear, sight, it, is, held, stationary, against, tension, by, the, second, piece, which, is, shaped, like, a, flattened, c, and, acts, as, the, sear, the, sear, cannot, move, as, it, is, trapped, by, the, third, piece, i, e, the, actual, trigger, blade, which, hangs, vertically, below, the, enclosure, and, catches, the, sear, via, a, notch, the, two, bearing, surfaces, between, the, three, trigger, pieces, each, offers, a, mechanical, advantage, which, allow, for, handling, significant, draw, weights, with, a, much, smaller, pull, weight, during, shooting, the, user, will, hold, the, crossbow, at, eye, level, by, a, vertical, handle, and, aim, along, the, arrow, using, the, sighting, spine, for, elevation, similar, to, how, a, modern, rifleman, shoots, with, iron, sights, when, the, trigger, blade, is, pulled, its, notch, disengages, from, the, sear, and, allows, the, latter, to, drop, downwards, which, in, turn, frees, up, the, nuts, to, pivot, forward, and, release, the, bowstring, the, nu, is, so, called, because, it, spreads, abroad, an, aura, of, rage, its, stock, is, like, the, arm, of, a, man, therefore, it, is, called, bi, that, which, hooks, the, bowstring, is, called, ya, for, indeed, it, is, like, teeth, the, part, round, about, the, teeth, is, called, the, guo, since, it, surrounds, the, gui, of, the, teeth, within, there, is, the, xuan, dao, so, called, because, it, looks, like, one, the, whole, assembly, is, called, ji, for, it, is, just, as, ingenious, as, the, loom, the, earliest, european, designs, featured, a, transverse, slot, in, the, top, surface, of, the, frame, down, into, which, the, string, was, placed, to, shoot, this, design, a, vertical, rod, is, thrust, up, through, a, hole, in, the, bottom, of, the, notch, forcing, the, string, out, this, rod, is, usually, attached, perpendicular, to, a, rear, facing, lever, called, a, tickler, a, later, design, implemented, a, rolling, cylindrical, pawl, called, a, nut, to, retain, the, string, this, nut, has, a, perpendicular, centre, slot, for, the, bolt, and, an, intersecting, axial, slot, for, the, string, along, with, a, lower, face, or, slot, against, which, the, internal, trigger, sits, they, often, also, have, some, form, of, strengthening, internal, sear, or, trigger, face, usually, of, metal, these, roller, nuts, were, either, free, floating, in, their, close, fitting, hole, across, the, stock, tied, in, with, a, binding, of, sinew, or, other, strong, cording, or, mounted, on, a, metal, axle, or, pins, removable, or, integral, plates, of, wood, ivory, or, metal, on, the, sides, of, the, stock, kept, the, nut, in, place, laterally, nuts, were, made, of, antler, bone, or, metal, bows, could, be, kept, taut, and, ready, to, shoot, for, some, time, with, little, physical, straining, allowing, crossbowmen, to, aim, better, without, fatiguing, chinese, crossbow, bows, were, made, of, composite, material, from, the, start, european, crossbows, from, the, 10th, to, 12th, centuries, used, wood, for, the, bow, also, called, the, prod, or, lath, which, tended, to, be, ash, or, yew, composite, bows, started, appearing, in, europe, during, the, 13th, century, and, could, be, made, from, layers, of, different, material, often, wood, horn, and, sinew, glued, together, and, bound, with, animal, tendon, these, composite, bows, made, of, several, layers, are, much, stronger, and, more, efficient, in, releasing, energy, than, simple, wooden, bows, as, steel, became, more, widely, available, in, europe, around, the, 14th, century, steel, prods, came, into, use, traditionally, the, prod, was, often, lashed, to, the, stock, with, rope, whipcord, or, other, strong, cording, this, is, called, the, bridle, the, chinese, used, winches, for, large, crossbows, mounted, on, fortifications, or, wagons, known, as, bedded, crossbows, winches, may, have, been, used, for, handheld, crossbows, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 9, ad, 25, 220, ad, but, there, is, only, one, known, depiction, of, it, the, 11th, century, chinese, military, text, wujing, zongyao, mentions, types, of, crossbows, using, winch, mechanisms, but, it, is, not, known, if, these, were, actually, handheld, crossbows, or, mounted, crossbows, another, drawing, method, involved, the, shooters, sitting, on, the, ground, and, using, the, combined, strength, of, leg, waist, back, and, arm, muscles, to, help, span, much, heavier, crossbows, which, were, aptly, called, waist, spun, crossbows, during, the, medieval, era, both, chinese, and, european, crossbows, used, stirrups, as, well, as, belt, hooks, in, the, 13th, century, european, crossbows, started, using, winches, and, from, the, 14th, century, an, assortment, of, spanning, mechanisms, such, as, winch, pulleys, cord, pulleys, gaffles, such, as, gaffe, levers, goat, s, foot, levers, and, rarer, internal, lever, action, mechanisms, cranequins, and, even, screws, the, smallest, crossbows, are, pistol, crossbows, others, are, simple, long, stocks, with, the, crossbow, mounted, on, them, these, could, be, shot, from, under, the, arm, the, next, step, in, development, was, stocks, of, the, shape, that, would, later, be, used, for, firearms, which, allowed, better, aiming, the, arbalest, was, a, heavy, crossbow, that, required, special, systems, for, pulling, the, sinew, via, windlasses, for, siege, warfare, the, size, of, crossbows, was, further, increased, to, hurl, large, projectiles, such, as, rocks, at, fortifications, the, required, crossbows, needed, a, massive, base, frame, and, powerful, windlass, devices, the, arrow, like, projectiles, of, a, crossbow, are, called, bolts, or, quarrels, these, are, usually, much, shorter, than, arrows, but, can, be, several, times, heavier, there, is, an, optimum, weight, for, bolts, to, achieve, maximum, kinetic, energy, which, varies, depending, on, the, strength, and, characteristics, of, the, crossbow, but, most, could, pass, through, common, mail, crossbow, bolts, can, be, fitted, with, a, variety, of, heads, some, with, sickle, shaped, heads, to, cut, rope, or, rigging, but, the, most, common, today, is, a, four, sided, point, called, a, quarrel, a, highly, specialized, type, of, bolt, is, employed, to, collect, blubber, biopsy, samples, used, in, biology, research, even, relatively, small, differences, in, arrow, weight, can, have, a, considerable, impact, on, its, flight, trajectory, and, drop, bullet, shooting, crossbows, are, modified, crossbows, that, use, bullets, or, stones, as, projectiles, the, ancient, chinese, crossbow, often, included, a, metal, i, e, bronze, or, steel, grid, serving, as, iron, sights, modern, crossbow, sights, often, use, similar, technology, to, modern, firearm, sights, such, as, red, dot, sights, and, telescopic, sights, many, crossbow, scopes, feature, multiple, crosshairs, to, compensate, for, the, significant, effects, of, gravity, over, different, ranges, in, most, cases, a, newly, bought, crossbow, will, need, to, be, sighted, for, accurate, shooting, a, major, cause, of, the, sound, of, shooting, a, crossbow, is, vibration, of, various, components, crossbow, silencers, are, multiple, components, placed, on, high, vibration, parts, such, as, the, string, and, limbs, to, dampen, vibration, and, suppress, the, sound, of, loosing, the, bolt, in, terms, of, archaeological, evidence, crossbow, locks, made, of, cast, bronze, have, been, found, in, china, dating, to, around, 650, bc, they, have, also, been, found, in, tombs, 3, and, 12, at, qufu, shandong, previously, the, capital, of, lu, and, date, to, the, 6th, century, bc, bronze, crossbow, bolts, dating, from, the, mid, 5th, century, bc, have, been, found, at, a, chu, burial, site, in, yutaishan, jiangling, county, hubei, province, other, early, finds, of, crossbows, were, discovered, in, tomb, 138, at, saobatang, hunan, province, and, date, to, the, mid, 4th, century, bc, it, is, possible, that, these, early, crossbows, used, spherical, pellets, for, ammunition, a, western, han, mathematician, and, music, theorist, jing, fang, 78, 37, bc, compared, the, moon, to, the, shape, of, a, round, crossbow, bullet, the, zhuangzi, also, mentions, crossbow, bullets, the, earliest, chinese, documents, mentioning, a, crossbow, were, texts, from, the, 4th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, attributed, to, the, followers, of, mozi, this, source, refers, to, the, use, of, a, giant, crossbow, between, the, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bc, corresponding, to, the, late, spring, and, autumn, period, sun, tzu, s, the, art, of, war, first, appearance, dated, between, 500, bc, to, 300, bc, refers, to, the, characteristics, and, use, of, crossbows, in, chapters, 5, and, 12, respectively, and, compares, a, drawn, crossbow, to, might, the, huainanzi, advises, its, readers, not, to, use, crossbows, in, marshland, where, the, surface, is, soft, and, it, is, hard, to, arm, the, crossbow, with, the, foot, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, completed, in, 94, bc, mentions, that, sun, bin, defeated, pang, juan, by, ambushing, him, with, a, battalion, of, crossbowmen, at, the, battle, of, maling, in, 342, bc, the, book, of, han, finished, 111, ad, lists, two, military, treatises, on, crossbows, handheld, crossbows, with, complex, bronze, trigger, mechanisms, have, also, been, found, with, the, terracotta, army, in, the, tomb, of, qin, shi, huang, r, 221, 210, bc, that, are, similar, to, specimens, from, the, subsequent, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, while, crossbowmen, described, in, the, qin, and, han, dynasty, learned, drill, formations, some, were, even, mounted, as, charioteers, and, cavalry, units, and, han, dynasty, writers, attributed, the, success, of, numerous, battles, against, the, xiongnu, and, western, regions, city, states, to, massed, crossbow, volleys, the, bronze, triggers, were, designed, in, such, a, way, that, they, were, able, to, store, a, large, amount, of, energy, within, the, bow, when, drawn, but, was, easily, shot, with, little, resistance, and, recoil, when, the, trigger, was, pulled, the, trigger, nut, also, had, a, long, vertical, spine, that, could, be, used, like, a, primitive, rear, sight, for, elevation, adjustment, which, allowed, precision, shooting, over, longer, distances, the, qin, and, han, dynasty, era, crossbow, was, also, an, early, example, of, a, modular, design, as, the, bronze, trigger, components, were, also, mass, produced, with, relative, precise, tolerances, so, that, the, parts, were, interchangeable, between, different, crossbows, the, trigger, mechanism, from, one, crossbow, can, be, installed, into, another, simply, by, dropping, into, a, tiller, slot, of, the, same, specifications, and, secured, with, dowel, pins, some, crossbow, designs, were, also, found, to, be, fitted, with, bronze, buttplates, and, trigger, guard, it, is, clear, from, surviving, inventory, lists, in, gansu, and, xinjiang, that, the, crossbow, was, greatly, favored, by, the, han, dynasty, for, example, in, one, batch, of, slips, there, are, only, two, mentions, of, bows, but, thirty, mentions, of, crossbows, crossbows, were, mass, produced, in, state, armories, with, designs, improving, as, time, went, on, such, as, the, use, of, a, mulberry, wood, stock, and, brass, such, crossbows, during, the, song, dynasty, in, 1068, ad, could, pierce, a, tree, at, 140, paces, crossbows, were, used, in, numbers, as, large, as, 50, 000, starting, from, the, qin, dynasty, and, upwards, of, several, hundred, thousand, during, the, han, according, to, one, authority, the, crossbow, had, become, nothing, less, than, the, standard, weapon, of, the, han, armies, by, the, second, century, bc, han, soldiers, were, required, to, arm, a, crossbow, with, a, draw, weight, equivalent, of, 76, kg, 168, lb, to, qualify, as, an, entry, level, crossbowman, while, it, was, claimed, that, a, few, elite, troops, were, capable, of, arming, crossbows, with, a, draw, weight, in, excess, of, 340, kg, 750, lb, by, the, hands, and, feet, method, after, the, han, dynasty, the, crossbow, lost, favor, during, the, six, dynasties, until, it, experienced, a, mild, resurgence, during, the, tang, dynasty, under, which, the, ideal, expeditionary, army, of, 20, 000, included, 2, 200, archers, and, 2, 000, crossbowmen, li, jing, and, li, quan, prescribed, 20, percent, of, the, infantry, to, be, armed, with, crossbows, during, the, song, dynasty, the, crossbow, received, a, huge, upsurge, in, military, usage, and, often, overshadowed, the, bow, 2, to, 1, in, numbers, during, this, time, period, a, stirrup, was, added, for, ease, of, loading, the, song, government, attempted, to, restrict, the, public, use, of, crossbows, and, sought, ways, to, keep, both, body, armor, and, crossbows, out, of, civilian, ownership, despite, the, ban, on, certain, types, of, crossbows, the, weapon, experienced, an, upsurge, in, civilian, usage, as, both, a, hunting, weapon, and, pastime, the, romantic, young, people, from, rich, families, and, others, who, had, nothing, particular, to, do, formed, crossbow, shooting, clubs, as, a, way, to, pass, time, during, the, late, ming, dynasty, no, crossbows, were, mentioned, to, have, been, produced, in, the, three, year, period, from, 1619, to, 1622, with, 21, 188, 366, taels, the, ming, manufactured, 25, 134, cannons, 8, 252, small, guns, 6, 425, muskets, 4, 090, culverins, 98, 547, polearms, and, swords, 26, 214, great, horse, decapitator, swords, 42, 800, bows, 1, 000, great, axes, 2, 284, 000, arrows, 180, 000, fire, arrows, 64, 000, bow, strings, and, hundreds, of, transport, carts, military, crossbows, were, armed, by, treading, or, basically, placing, the, feet, on, the, bow, stave, and, drawing, it, using, one, s, arms, and, back, muscles, during, the, song, dynasty, stirrups, were, added, for, ease, of, drawing, and, to, mitigate, damage, to, the, bow, alternatively, the, bow, could, also, be, drawn, by, a, belt, claw, attached, to, the, waist, but, this, was, done, lying, down, as, was, the, case, for, all, large, crossbows, winch, drawing, was, used, for, the, large, mounted, crossbows, as, seen, below, but, evidence, for, its, use, in, chinese, hand, crossbows, is, scant, there, were, also, other, sorts, of, crossbows, such, as, the, repeating, crossbow, multi, shot, crossbow, and, larger, field, artillery, crossbows, around, the, third, century, bc, king, an, d, ng, of, u, l, c, modern, day, northern, vietnam, and, modern, day, southern, china, commissioned, a, man, named, cao, l, or, cao, th, ng, to, construct, a, crossbow, and, christened, it, saintly, crossbow, of, the, supernaturally, luminous, golden, claw, n, th, n, which, could, kill, 300, men, in, one, shot, according, to, historian, keith, taylor, the, crossbow, along, with, the, word, for, it, seems, to, have, been, introduced, into, china, from, austroasiatic, peoples, in, the, south, around, the, fourth, century, bc, however, this, is, contradicted, by, crossbow, locks, found, in, ancient, chinese, zhou, dynasty, tombs, dating, to, the, 600s, bc, in, 315, ad, nu, wen, taught, the, chams, how, to, build, fortifications, and, use, crossbows, the, chams, would, later, give, the, chinese, crossbows, as, presents, on, at, least, one, occasion, crossbow, technology, for, crossbows, with, more, than, one, prod, was, transferred, from, the, chinese, to, champa, which, champa, used, in, its, invasion, of, the, khmer, empire, s, angkor, in, 1177, when, the, chams, sacked, angkor, they, used, the, chinese, siege, crossbow, the, chinese, taught, the, chams, how, to, use, crossbows, and, mounted, archery, crossbows, and, archery, in, 1171, the, khmer, also, had, double, bow, crossbows, mounted, on, elephants, which, michel, jacq, hergoualc, h, suggests, were, elements, of, cham, mercenaries, in, jayavarman, vii, s, army, the, native, montagnards, of, vietnam, s, central, highlands, were, also, known, to, have, used, crossbows, as, both, a, tool, for, hunting, and, later, an, effective, weapon, against, the, viet, cong, during, the, vietnam, war, montagnard, fighters, armed, with, crossbows, proved, a, highly, valuable, asset, to, the, us, special, forces, operating, in, vietnam, and, it, was, not, uncommon, for, the, green, berets, to, integrate, montagnard, crossbowmen, into, their, strike, teams, the, earliest, crossbow, like, weapons, in, europe, probably, emerged, around, the, late, 5th, century, bc, when, the, gastraphetes, an, ancient, greek, crossbow, appeared, the, name, means, belly, bow, the, concave, withdrawal, rest, at, one, end, of, the, stock, was, placed, against, the, belly, of, the, operator, and, he, could, press, it, to, withdraw, the, slider, before, attaching, a, string, to, the, trigger, and, loading, the, bolt, this, could, store, more, energy, than, greek, bows, the, device, was, described, by, the, greek, author, heron, of, alexandria, in, his, belopoeica, on, catapult, making, which, draws, on, an, earlier, account, of, his, compatriot, engineer, ctesibius, fl, 285, 222, bc, according, to, heron, the, gastraphetes, was, the, forerunner, of, the, later, catapult, which, places, its, invention, some, unknown, time, prior, to, 399, bc, the, gastraphetes, was, a, crossbow, mounted, on, a, stock, divided, into, a, lower, and, upper, section, the, lower, was, a, case, fixed, to, the, bow, and, the, upper, was, a, slider, which, had, the, same, dimensions, as, the, case, it, was, used, in, the, siege, of, motya, in, 397, bc, this, was, a, key, carthaginian, stronghold, in, sicily, as, described, in, the, 1st, century, ad, by, heron, of, alexandria, in, his, book, belopoeica, there, were, also, other, arrow, shooting, machines, such, as, the, larger, ballista, and, smaller, scorpio, from, around, 338, bc, but, these, are, torsion, catapults, and, are, not, considered, crossbows, arrow, shooting, machines, katapeltai, are, briefly, mentioned, by, aeneas, tacticus, in, his, treatise, on, siegecraft, written, around, 350, bc, an, athenian, inventory, from, 330, to, 329, bc, includes, catapults, bolts, with, heads, and, flights, arrow, shooting, machines, in, action, are, reported, from, philip, ii, s, siege, of, perinthos, in, thrace, in, 340, bc, at, the, same, time, greek, fortifications, began, to, feature, high, towers, with, shuttered, windows, in, the, top, presumably, to, house, anti, personnel, arrow, shooters, as, in, aigosthena, the, late, 4th, century, author, vegetius, in, his, de, re, militari, describes, arcubalistarii, crossbowmen, working, together, with, archers, and, artillerymen, however, it, is, disputed, whether, arcuballistas, were, crossbows, or, torsion, powered, weapons, the, idea, that, the, arcuballista, was, a, crossbow, is, due, to, vegetius, referring, separately, to, it, and, the, manuballista, which, was, torsion, powered, therefore, if, the, arcuballista, was, not, like, the, manuballista, it, may, have, been, a, crossbow, according, to, vegetius, these, were, well, known, devices, and, hence, he, did, not, describe, them, in, depth, joseph, needham, argues, against, the, existence, of, roman, crossbowmen, on, the, textual, side, there, is, almost, nothing, but, passing, references, in, the, military, historian, vegetius, fl, 386, to, manuballistae, and, arcuballistae, which, he, said, he, must, decline, to, describe, as, they, were, so, well, known, his, decision, was, highly, regrettable, as, no, other, author, of, the, time, makes, any, mention, of, them, at, all, perhaps, the, best, supposition, is, that, the, crossbow, was, primarily, known, in, late, european, antiquity, as, a, hunting, weapon, and, received, only, local, use, in, certain, units, of, the, armies, of, theodosius, i, with, which, vegetius, happened, to, be, acquainted, on, the, other, hand, arrian, s, earlier, ars, tactica, from, about, 136, ad, also, mentions, missiles, shot, not, from, a, bow, but, from, a, machine, and, that, this, machine, was, used, on, horseback, while, in, full, gallop, it, is, presumed, that, this, was, a, crossbow, the, only, pictorial, evidence, of, roman, arcuballistas, comes, from, sculptural, reliefs, in, roman, gaul, depicting, them, in, hunting, scenes, these, are, aesthetically, similar, to, both, the, greek, and, chinese, crossbow, but, it, is, not, clear, what, kind, of, release, mechanism, they, used, archaeological, evidence, suggests, they, were, similar, to, the, rolling, nut, mechanism, of, medieval, europe, there, are, essentially, no, references, to, the, crossbow, in, europe, from, the, 5th, until, the, 10th, century, there, is, however, a, depiction, of, a, crossbow, as, a, hunting, weapon, on, four, pictish, stones, from, early, medieval, scotland, 6th, to, 9th, centuries, st, vigeans, no, 1, glenferness, shandwick, and, meigle, the, crossbow, reappeared, again, in, 947, as, a, french, weapon, during, the, siege, of, senlis, and, again, in, 984, at, the, siege, of, verdun, crossbows, were, used, at, the, battle, of, hastings, in, 1066, and, by, the, 12th, century, they, had, become, common, battlefield, weapons, the, earliest, extant, european, crossbow, remains, were, found, at, lake, paladru, dated, to, the, 11th, century, the, crossbow, superseded, hand, bows, in, many, european, armies, during, the, 12th, century, except, in, england, where, the, longbow, was, more, popular, later, crossbows, sometimes, referred, to, as, arbalests, utilizing, all, steel, prods, were, able, to, achieve, power, close, and, sometime, superior, to, longbows, but, were, more, expensive, to, produce, and, slower, to, reload, because, they, required, the, aid, of, mechanical, devices, such, as, the, cranequin, or, windlass, to, draw, back, their, extremely, heavy, bows, usually, these, could, shoot, only, two, bolts, per, minute, versus, twelve, or, more, with, a, skilled, archer, often, necessitating, the, use, of, a, pavise, shield, to, protect, the, operator, from, enemy, fire, along, with, polearm, weapons, made, from, farming, equipment, the, crossbow, was, also, a, weapon, of, choice, for, insurgent, peasants, such, as, the, taborites, genoese, crossbowmen, were, famous, mercenaries, hired, throughout, medieval, europe, whilst, the, crossbow, also, played, an, important, role, in, anti, personnel, defense, of, ships, crossbows, were, eventually, replaced, in, warfare, by, gunpowder, weapons, early, hand, cannons, had, slower, rates, of, fire, and, much, worse, accuracy, than, contemporary, crossbows, but, the, arquebus, which, proliferated, in, the, mid, to, late, 15th, century, matched, crossbows, rate, of, fire, while, being, far, more, powerful, the, battle, of, cerignola, in, 1503, was, won, by, spain, largely, through, the, use, of, matchlock, arquebuses, marking, the, first, time, a, major, battle, had, been, won, through, the, use, of, hand, held, firearms, later, similar, competing, tactics, would, feature, harquebusiers, or, musketeers, in, formation, with, pikemen, pitted, against, cavalry, firing, pistols, or, carbines, while, the, military, crossbow, had, largely, been, supplanted, by, firearms, on, the, battlefield, by, 1525, the, sporting, crossbow, in, various, forms, remained, a, popular, hunting, weapon, in, europe, until, the, eighteenth, century, crossbows, saw, irregular, use, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 16th, century, for, example, maria, pita, s, husband, was, killed, by, a, crossbowman, of, the, english, armada, in, 1589, there, are, no, references, to, crossbows, in, islamic, texts, earlier, than, the, 14th, century, arabs, in, general, were, averse, to, the, crossbow, and, considered, it, a, foreign, weapon, they, called, it, qaus, al, rijl, foot, drawn, bow, qaus, al, zanb, rak, bolt, bow, and, qaus, al, faranj, yah, frankish, bow, although, muslims, did, have, crossbows, there, seems, to, be, a, split, between, eastern, and, western, types, muslims, in, spain, used, the, typical, european, trigger, while, eastern, muslim, crossbows, had, a, more, complex, trigger, mechanism, mamluk, cavalry, used, crossbows, oyumi, were, ancient, japanese, artillery, pieces, that, first, appeared, in, the, seventh, century, during, the, asuka, period, according, to, japanese, records, the, oyumi, was, different, from, the, handheld, crossbow, also, in, use, during, the, same, time, period, a, quote, from, a, seventh, century, source, seems, to, suggest, that, the, oyumi, may, have, able, to, fire, multiple, arrows, at, once, the, oyumi, were, lined, up, and, fired, at, random, the, arrows, fell, like, rain, a, ninth, century, japanese, artisan, named, shimaki, no, fubito, claimed, to, have, improved, on, a, version, of, the, weapon, used, by, the, chinese, his, version, could, rotate, and, fire, projectiles, in, multiple, directions, the, last, recorded, use, of, the, oyumi, was, in, 1189, in, west, and, central, africa, crossbows, served, as, a, scouting, weapon, and, for, hunting, with, african, slaves, bringing, this, technology, to, natives, in, america, in, the, southern, united, states, the, crossbow, was, used, for, hunting, and, warfare, when, firearms, or, gunpowder, were, unavailable, because, of, economic, hardships, or, isolation, in, the, north, of, northern, america, light, hunting, crossbows, were, traditionally, used, by, the, inuit, these, are, technologically, similar, to, the, african, derived, crossbows, but, have, a, different, route, of, influence, spanish, conquistadors, continued, to, use, crossbows, in, the, americas, long, after, they, were, replaced, in, european, battlefields, by, firearms, only, in, the, 1570s, did, firearms, become, completely, dominant, among, the, spanish, in, the, americas, the, french, and, the, british, used, a, crossbow, like, sauterelle, french, for, grasshopper, in, world, war, i, it, was, lighter, and, more, portable, than, the, leach, trench, catapult, but, less, powerful, it, weighed, 24, kg, 53, lb, and, could, throw, an, f1, grenade, or, mills, bomb, 110, 140, m, 120, 150, yd, the, sauterelle, replaced, the, leach, catapult, in, british, service, and, was, in, turn, replaced, in, 1916, by, the, 2, inch, medium, trench, mortar, and, stokes, mortar, early, in, the, war, actual, crossbows, were, pressed, into, service, in, small, numbers, by, both, french, and, german, troops, to, launch, grenades, a, range, of, crossbows, were, developed, by, the, allied, powers, during, the, second, world, war, for, assassinations, and, covert, operations, but, none, appear, to, have, ever, been, used, in, the, field, a, small, number, of, crossbows, were, built, and, used, by, australian, forces, in, the, new, guinea, campaign, crossbows, are, used, for, shooting, sports, and, bowhunting, in, modern, archery, and, for, blubber, biopsy, samples, in, scientific, research, in, some, countries, such, as, canada, they, may, be, less, heavily, regulated, than, firearms, and, thus, more, popular, for, hunting, some, jurisdictions, have, bow, and, or, crossbow, only, seasons, crossbows, are, no, longer, used, in, battles, but, they, are, still, used, in, some, military, applications, for, example, there, is, an, undated, photograph, of, peruvian, soldiers, equipped, with, crossbows, and, rope, to, establish, a, zip, line, in, difficult, terrain, in, brazil, the, cigs, jungle, warfare, training, center, also, trains, soldiers, in, the, use, of, crossbows, in, the, united, states, saa, international, ltd, manufacture, a, 200, j, 150, ft, lbf, crossbow, launched, version, of, the, u, s, army, type, classified, launched, grapnel, hook, lgh, among, other, mine, countermeasure, solutions, designed, for, the, middle, eastern, theatre, it, was, evaluated, as, successful, in, cambodia, and, bosnia, it, is, used, to, probe, for, and, detonate, tripwire, initiated, mines, and, booby, traps, at, up, to, 50, m, 55, yd, the, concept, is, similar, to, the, lgh, device, originally, fired, from, a, rifle, as, a, plastic, retrieval, line, is, attached, reusable, up, to, 20, times, the, line, can, be, reeled, back, in, without, exposing, the, user, the, device, is, of, particular, use, in, tactical, situations, where, noise, discipline, is, important, in, europe, barnett, international, sold, crossbows, to, serbian, forces, which, according, to, the, guardian, were, later, used, in, ambushes, and, as, a, counter, sniper, weapon, against, the, kosovo, liberation, army, during, the, kosovo, war, in, the, areas, of, pec, and, djakovica, south, west, of, kosovo, whitehall, launched, an, investigation, though, the, department, of, trade, and, industry, established, that, not, being, on, the, military, list, crossbows, were, not, covered, by, export, restrictions, paul, beaver, of, jane, s, defence, publications, commented, that, they, are, not, only, a, silent, killer, they, also, have, a, psychological, effect, on, 15, february, 2008, serbian, minister, of, defence, dragan, sutanovac, was, pictured, testing, a, barnett, crossbow, during, a, public, exercise, of, the, serbian, army, s, special, forces, in, nis, 200, km, 120, mi, south, of, belgrade, special, forces, in, both, greece, and, turkey, also, continue, to, employ, the, crossbow, spain, s, green, berets, still, use, the, crossbow, as, well, in, asia, some, chinese, armed, forces, use, crossbows, including, the, special, force, snow, leopard, commando, unit, of, the, people, s, armed, police, and, the, people, s, liberation, army, one, reason, for, this, is, the, crossbow, s, ability, to, stop, persons, carrying, explosives, without, risk, of, causing, detonation, during, the, xinjiang, riots, of, july, 2009, crossbows, were, used, by, security, forces, to, suppress, rioters, the, indian, navy, s, marine, commando, force, were, equipped, until, the, late, 1980s, with, crossbows, with, cyanide, tipped, bolts, as, an, alternative, to, suppressed, handguns, with, a, crossbow, archers, could, release, a, draw, force, far, in, excess, of, what, they, could, have, handled, with, a, bow, furthermore, the, crossbow, could, hold, the, tension, indefinitely, whereas, even, the, strongest, longbowman, could, only, hold, a, drawn, bow, for, a, short, time, the, ease, of, use, of, a, crossbow, allows, it, to, be, used, effectively, with, little, training, while, other, types, of, bows, take, far, more, skill, to, shoot, accurately, the, disadvantage, is, the, greater, weight, and, clumsiness, to, reload, compared, to, a, bow, as, well, as, the, slower, rate, of, shooting, and, the, lower, efficiency, of, the, acceleration, system, but, there, would, be, reduced, elastic, hysteresis, making, the, crossbow, a, more, accurate, weapon, medieval, european, crossbows, had, a, much, smaller, draw, length, than, bows, so, that, for, the, same, energy, to, be, imparted, to, the, projectile, the, crossbow, had, to, have, a, much, higher, draw, weight, a, direct, comparison, between, a, fast, hand, drawn, replica, crossbow, and, a, longbow, shows, a, 6, 10, rate, of, shooting, or, a, 4, 9, rate, within, 30, seconds, and, comparable, weapons, today, the, crossbow, often, has, a, complicated, legal, status, due, to, the, possibility, of, lethal, use, and, its, similarities, to, both, firearms, and, bows, while, some, jurisdictions, treat, crossbows, in, the, same, way, as, firearms, many, others, do, not, require, any, sort, of, license, to, own, a, crossbow, the, legality, of, using, a, crossbow, for, hunting, varies, widely, in, different, jurisdictions
