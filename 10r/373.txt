a, valve, is, a, device, or, natural, object, that, regulates, directs, or, controls, the, flow, of, a, fluid, gases, liquids, fluidized, solids, or, slurries, by, opening, closing, or, partially, obstructing, various, passageways, valves, are, technically, fittings, but, are, usually, discussed, as, a, separate, category, in, an, open, valve, fluid, flows, in, a, direction, from, higher, pressure, to, lower, pressure, the, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, valva, the, moving, part, of, a, door, in, turn, from, volvere, to, turn, roll, the, simplest, and, very, ancient, valve, is, simply, a, freely, hinged, flap, which, swings, down, to, obstruct, fluid, gas, or, liquid, flow, in, one, direction, but, is, pushed, up, by, the, flow, itself, when, the, flow, is, moving, in, the, opposite, direction, this, is, called, a, check, valve, as, it, prevents, or, checks, the, flow, in, one, direction, modern, control, valves, may, regulate, pressure, or, flow, downstream, and, operate, on, sophisticated, automation, systems, valves, have, many, uses, including, controlling, water, for, irrigation, industrial, uses, for, controlling, processes, residential, uses, such, as, on, off, and, pressure, control, to, dish, and, clothes, washers, and, taps, in, the, home, valves, are, also, used, in, the, military, and, transport, sectors, in, hvac, ductwork, and, other, near, atmospheric, air, flows, valves, are, instead, called, dampers, in, compressed, air, systems, however, valves, are, used, with, the, most, common, type, being, ball, valves, valves, are, found, in, virtually, every, industrial, process, including, water, and, sewage, processing, mining, power, generation, processing, of, oil, gas, and, petroleum, food, manufacturing, chemical, and, plastic, manufacturing, and, many, other, fields, people, in, developed, nations, use, valves, in, their, daily, lives, including, plumbing, valves, such, as, taps, for, tap, water, gas, control, valves, on, cookers, small, valves, fitted, to, washing, machines, and, dishwashers, safety, devices, fitted, to, hot, water, systems, and, poppet, valves, in, car, engines, in, nature, there, are, valves, for, example, one, way, valves, in, veins, controlling, the, blood, circulation, and, heart, valves, controlling, the, flow, of, blood, in, the, chambers, of, the, heart, and, maintaining, the, correct, pumping, action, valves, may, be, operated, manually, either, by, a, handle, or, grip, lever, pedal, or, wheel, valves, may, also, be, automatic, driven, by, changes, in, pressure, temperature, or, flow, these, changes, may, act, upon, a, diaphragm, or, a, piston, which, in, turn, activates, the, valve, examples, of, this, type, of, valve, found, commonly, are, safety, valves, fitted, to, hot, water, systems, or, boilers, more, complex, control, systems, using, valves, requiring, automatic, control, based, on, an, external, input, i, e, regulating, flow, through, a, pipe, to, a, changing, set, point, require, an, actuator, an, actuator, will, stroke, the, valve, depending, on, its, input, and, set, up, allowing, the, valve, to, be, positioned, accurately, and, allowing, control, over, a, variety, of, requirements, valves, vary, widely, in, form, and, application, sizes, typically, range, from, 0, 1, mm, to, 60, cm, special, valves, can, have, a, diameter, exceeding, 5, meters, valve, costs, range, from, simple, inexpensive, disposable, valves, to, specialized, valves, which, cost, thousands, of, dollars, us, per, inch, of, the, diameter, of, the, valve, disposable, valves, may, be, found, in, common, household, items, including, mini, pump, dispensers, and, aerosol, cans, a, common, use, of, the, term, valve, refers, to, the, poppet, valves, found, in, the, vast, majority, of, modern, internal, combustion, engines, such, as, those, in, most, fossil, fuel, powered, vehicles, which, are, used, to, control, the, intake, of, the, fuel, air, mixture, and, allow, exhaust, gas, venting, valves, are, quite, diverse, and, may, be, classified, into, a, number, of, basic, types, valves, may, also, be, classified, by, how, they, are, actuated, the, main, parts, of, the, most, usual, type, of, valve, are, the, body, and, the, bonnet, these, two, parts, form, the, casing, that, holds, the, fluid, going, through, the, valve, the, valve, s, body, is, the, outer, casing, of, most, or, all, of, the, valve, that, contains, the, internal, parts, or, trim, the, bonnet, is, the, part, of, the, encasing, through, which, the, stem, see, below, passes, and, that, forms, a, guide, and, seal, for, the, stem, the, bonnet, typically, screws, into, or, is, bolted, to, the, valve, body, valve, bodies, are, usually, metallic, or, plastic, brass, bronze, gunmetal, cast, iron, steel, alloy, steels, and, stainless, steels, are, very, common, seawater, applications, like, desalination, plants, often, use, duplex, valves, as, well, as, super, duplex, valves, due, to, their, corrosion, resistant, properties, particularly, against, warm, seawater, alloy, 20, valves, are, typically, used, in, sulphuric, acid, plants, whilst, monel, valves, are, used, in, hydrofluoric, acid, hf, acid, plants, hastelloy, valves, are, often, used, in, high, temperature, applications, such, as, nuclear, plants, whilst, inconel, valves, are, often, used, in, hydrogen, applications, plastic, bodies, are, used, for, relatively, low, pressures, and, temperatures, pvc, pp, pvdf, and, glass, reinforced, nylon, are, common, plastics, used, for, valve, bodies, a, bonnet, acts, as, a, cover, on, the, valve, body, it, is, commonly, semi, permanently, screwed, into, the, valve, body, or, bolted, onto, it, during, manufacture, of, the, valve, the, internal, parts, are, put, into, the, body, and, then, the, bonnet, is, attached, to, hold, everything, together, inside, to, access, internal, parts, of, a, valve, a, user, would, take, off, the, bonnet, usually, for, maintenance, many, valves, do, not, have, bonnets, for, example, plug, valves, usually, do, not, have, bonnets, many, ball, valves, do, not, have, bonnets, since, the, valve, body, is, put, together, in, a, different, style, such, as, being, screwed, together, at, the, middle, of, the, valve, body, ports, are, passages, that, allow, fluid, to, pass, through, the, valve, ports, are, obstructed, by, the, valve, member, or, disc, to, control, flow, valves, most, commonly, have, 2, ports, but, may, have, as, many, as, 20, the, valve, is, almost, always, connected, at, its, ports, to, pipes, or, other, components, connection, methods, include, threadings, compression, fittings, glue, cement, flanges, or, welding, a, handle, is, used, to, manually, control, a, valve, from, outside, the, valve, body, automatically, controlled, valves, often, do, not, have, handles, but, some, may, have, a, handle, or, something, similar, anyway, to, manually, override, automatic, control, such, as, a, stop, check, valve, an, actuator, is, a, mechanism, or, device, to, automatically, or, remotely, control, a, valve, from, outside, the, body, some, valves, have, neither, handle, nor, actuator, because, they, automatically, control, themselves, from, inside, for, example, check, valves, and, relief, valves, may, have, neither, a, disc, also, known, as, a, valve, member, is, a, movable, obstruction, inside, the, stationary, body, that, adjustably, restricts, flow, through, the, valve, although, traditionally, disc, shaped, discs, come, in, various, shapes, depending, on, the, type, of, valve, a, disc, can, move, linearly, inside, a, valve, or, rotate, on, the, stem, as, in, a, butterfly, valve, or, rotate, on, a, hinge, or, trunnion, as, in, a, check, valve, a, ball, is, a, round, valve, member, with, one, or, more, paths, between, ports, passing, through, it, by, rotating, the, ball, flow, can, be, directed, between, different, ports, ball, valves, use, spherical, rotors, with, a, cylindrical, hole, drilled, as, a, fluid, passage, plug, valves, use, cylindrical, or, conically, tapered, rotors, called, plugs, other, round, shapes, for, rotors, are, possible, as, well, in, rotor, valves, as, long, as, the, rotor, can, be, turned, inside, the, valve, body, however, not, all, round, or, spherical, discs, are, rotors, for, example, a, ball, check, valve, uses, the, ball, to, block, reverse, flow, but, is, not, a, rotor, because, operating, the, valve, does, not, involve, rotation, of, the, ball, the, seat, is, the, interior, surface, of, the, body, which, contacts, the, disc, to, form, a, leak, tight, seal, in, discs, that, move, linearly, or, swing, on, a, hinge, or, trunnion, the, disc, comes, into, contact, with, the, seat, only, when, the, valve, is, shut, in, disks, that, rotate, the, seat, is, always, in, contact, with, the, disk, but, the, area, of, contact, changes, as, the, disc, is, turned, the, seat, always, remains, stationary, relative, to, the, body, seats, are, classified, by, whether, they, are, cut, directly, into, the, body, or, if, they, are, made, of, a, different, material, a, closed, soft, seated, valve, is, much, less, liable, to, leak, when, shut, while, hard, seated, valves, are, more, durable, gate, globe, and, check, valves, are, usually, hard, seated, while, butterfly, ball, plug, and, diaphragm, valves, are, usually, soft, seated, the, stem, transmits, motion, from, the, handle, or, controlling, device, to, the, disc, the, stem, typically, passes, through, the, bonnet, when, present, in, some, cases, the, stem, and, the, disc, can, be, combined, in, one, piece, or, the, stem, and, the, handle, are, combined, in, one, piece, the, motion, transmitted, by, the, stem, may, be, a, linear, force, a, rotational, torque, or, some, combination, of, these, angle, valve, using, torque, reactor, pin, and, hub, assembly, the, valve, and, stem, can, be, threaded, such, that, the, stem, can, be, screwed, into, or, out, of, the, valve, by, turning, it, in, one, direction, or, the, other, thus, moving, the, disc, back, or, forth, inside, the, body, packing, is, often, used, between, the, stem, and, the, bonnet, to, maintain, a, seal, some, valves, have, no, external, control, and, do, not, need, a, stem, as, in, most, check, valves, valves, whose, disc, is, between, the, seat, and, the, stem, and, where, the, stem, moves, in, a, direction, into, the, valve, to, shut, it, are, normally, seated, or, front, seated, valves, whose, seat, is, between, the, disc, and, the, stem, and, where, the, stem, moves, in, a, direction, out, of, the, valve, to, shut, it, are, reverse, seated, or, back, seated, these, terms, don, t, apply, to, valves, with, no, stem, or, valves, using, rotors, gaskets, are, the, mechanical, seals, or, packings, used, to, prevent, the, leakage, of, a, gas, or, fluids, from, valves, a, valve, ball, is, also, used, for, severe, duty, high, pressure, high, tolerance, applications, they, are, typically, made, of, stainless, steel, titanium, stellite, hastelloy, brass, or, nickel, they, can, also, be, made, of, different, types, of, plastic, such, as, abs, pvc, pp, or, pvdf, many, valves, have, a, spring, for, spring, loading, to, normally, shift, the, disc, into, some, position, by, default, but, allow, control, to, reposition, the, disc, relief, valves, commonly, use, a, spring, to, keep, the, valve, shut, but, allow, excessive, pressure, to, force, the, valve, open, against, the, spring, loading, coil, springs, are, normally, used, typical, spring, materials, include, zinc, plated, steel, stainless, steel, and, for, high, temperature, applications, inconel, x750, the, internal, elements, of, a, valve, are, collectively, referred, to, as, a, valve, s, trim, according, to, api, standards, 600, steel, gate, valve, flanged, and, butt, welding, ends, bolted, bonnets, the, trim, consists, of, stem, seating, surface, in, the, body, gate, seating, surface, bushing, or, a, deposited, weld, for, the, backseat, and, stem, hole, guide, and, small, internal, parts, that, normally, contact, the, service, fluid, excluding, the, pin, that, is, used, to, make, a, stem, to, gate, connection, this, pin, shall, be, made, of, an, austenitic, stainless, steel, material, valve, positions, are, operating, conditions, determined, by, the, position, of, the, disc, or, rotor, in, the, valve, some, valves, are, made, to, be, operated, in, a, gradual, change, between, two, or, more, positions, return, valves, and, non, return, valves, allow, fluid, to, move, in, 2, or, 1, directions, respectively, operating, positions, for, 2, port, valves, can, be, either, shut, closed, so, that, no, flow, at, all, goes, through, fully, open, for, maximum, flow, or, sometimes, partially, open, to, any, degree, in, between, many, valves, are, not, designed, to, precisely, control, intermediate, degree, of, flow, such, valves, are, considered, to, be, either, open, or, shut, some, valves, are, specially, designed, to, regulate, varying, amounts, of, flow, such, valves, have, been, called, by, various, names, such, as, regulating, throttling, metering, or, needle, valves, for, example, needle, valves, have, elongated, conically, tapered, discs, and, matching, seats, for, fine, flow, control, for, some, valves, there, may, be, a, mechanism, to, indicate, by, how, much, the, valve, is, open, but, in, many, cases, other, indications, of, flow, rate, are, used, such, as, separate, flow, meters, in, plants, with, remote, controlled, process, operation, such, as, oil, refineries, and, petrochemical, plants, some, 2, way, valves, can, be, designated, as, normally, closed, nc, or, normally, open, no, during, regular, operation, examples, of, normally, closed, valves, are, sampling, valves, which, are, only, opened, while, a, sample, is, taken, other, examples, of, normally, closed, valves, are, emergency, shutdown, valves, which, are, kept, open, when, the, system, is, in, operation, and, will, automatically, shut, by, taking, away, the, power, supply, this, happens, when, there, is, a, problem, with, a, unit, or, a, section, of, a, fluid, system, such, as, a, leak, in, order, to, isolate, the, problem, from, the, rest, of, the, system, examples, of, normally, open, valves, are, purge, gas, supply, valves, or, emergency, relief, valves, when, there, is, a, problem, these, valves, open, by, switching, them, off, causing, the, unit, to, be, flushed, and, emptied, although, many, 2, way, valves, are, made, in, which, the, flow, can, go, in, either, direction, between, the, two, ports, when, a, valve, is, placed, into, a, certain, application, flow, is, often, expected, to, go, from, one, certain, port, on, the, upstream, side, of, the, valve, to, the, other, port, on, the, downstream, side, pressure, regulators, are, variations, of, valves, in, which, flow, is, controlled, to, produce, a, certain, downstream, pressure, if, possible, they, are, often, used, to, control, flow, of, gas, from, a, gas, cylinder, a, back, pressure, regulator, is, a, variation, of, a, valve, in, which, flow, is, controlled, to, maintain, a, certain, upstream, pressure, if, possible, valves, with, three, ports, serve, many, different, functions, a, few, of, the, possibilities, are, listed, here, three, way, ball, valves, come, with, t, or, l, shaped, fluid, passageways, inside, the, rotor, the, t, valve, might, be, used, to, permit, connection, of, one, inlet, to, either, or, both, outlets, or, connection, of, the, two, outlets, the, l, valve, could, be, used, to, permit, disconnection, of, both, or, connection, of, either, but, not, both, of, two, inlets, to, one, outlet, shuttle, valves, automatically, connect, the, higher, pressure, inlet, to, the, outlet, while, in, some, configurations, preventing, flow, from, one, inlet, to, the, other, single, handle, mixer, valves, produce, a, variable, mixture, of, hot, and, cold, water, at, a, variable, flow, rate, under, control, of, a, single, handle, thermostatic, mixing, valves, mix, hot, and, cold, water, to, produce, a, constant, temperature, in, the, presence, of, variable, pressures, and, temperatures, on, the, two, input, ports, a, 4, port, valve, is, a, valve, whose, body, has, four, ports, equally, spaced, round, the, body, and, the, disc, has, two, passages, to, connect, adjacent, ports, it, is, operated, with, two, positions, it, can, be, used, to, isolate, and, to, simultaneously, bypass, a, sampling, cylinder, installed, on, a, pressurized, water, line, it, is, useful, to, take, a, fluid, sample, without, affecting, the, pressure, of, a, hydraulic, system, and, to, avoid, degassing, no, leak, no, gas, loss, or, air, entry, no, external, contamination, many, valves, are, controlled, manually, with, a, handle, attached, to, the, stem, if, the, handle, is, turned, ninety, degrees, between, operating, positions, the, valve, is, called, a, quarter, turn, valve, butterfly, ball, valves, and, plug, valves, are, often, quarter, turn, valves, if, the, handle, is, circular, with, the, stem, as, the, axis, of, rotation, in, the, center, of, the, circle, then, the, handle, is, called, a, handwheel, valves, can, also, be, controlled, by, actuators, attached, to, the, stem, they, can, be, electromechanical, actuators, such, as, an, electric, motor, or, solenoid, pneumatic, actuators, which, are, controlled, by, air, pressure, or, hydraulic, actuators, which, are, controlled, by, the, pressure, of, a, liquid, such, as, oil, or, water, actuators, can, be, used, for, the, purposes, of, automatic, control, such, as, in, washing, machine, cycles, remote, control, such, as, the, use, of, a, centralised, control, room, or, because, manual, control, is, too, difficult, such, as, when, the, valve, is, very, large, pneumatic, actuators, and, hydraulic, actuators, need, pressurised, air, or, liquid, lines, to, supply, the, actuator, an, inlet, line, and, an, outlet, line, pilot, valves, are, valves, which, are, used, to, control, other, valves, pilot, valves, in, the, actuator, lines, control, the, supply, of, air, or, liquid, going, to, the, actuators, the, fill, valve, in, a, toilet, water, tank, is, a, liquid, level, actuated, valve, when, a, high, water, level, is, reached, a, mechanism, shuts, the, valve, which, fills, the, tank, in, some, valve, designs, the, pressure, of, the, flow, fluid, itself, or, pressure, difference, of, the, flow, fluid, between, the, ports, automatically, controls, flow, through, the, valve, valves, are, typically, rated, for, maximum, temperature, and, pressure, by, the, manufacturer, the, wetted, materials, in, a, valve, are, usually, identified, also, some, valves, rated, at, very, high, pressures, are, available, when, a, designer, engineer, or, user, decides, to, use, a, valve, for, an, application, he, she, should, ensure, the, rated, maximum, temperature, and, pressure, are, never, exceeded, and, that, the, wetted, materials, are, compatible, with, the, fluid, the, valve, interior, is, exposed, to, in, europe, valve, design, and, pressure, ratings, are, subject, to, statutory, regulation, under, the, pressure, equipment, directive, 97, 23, ec, ped, some, fluid, system, designs, especially, in, chemical, or, power, plants, are, schematically, represented, in, piping, and, instrumentation, diagrams, in, such, diagrams, different, types, of, valves, are, represented, by, certain, symbols, valves, in, good, condition, should, be, leak, free, however, valves, may, eventually, wear, out, from, use, and, develop, a, leak, either, between, the, inside, and, outside, of, the, valve, or, when, the, valve, is, shut, to, stop, flow, between, the, disc, and, the, seat, a, particle, trapped, between, the, seat, and, disc, could, also, cause, such, leakage
