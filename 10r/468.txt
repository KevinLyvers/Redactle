a, typewriter, is, a, mechanical, or, electromechanical, machine, for, typing, characters, typically, a, typewriter, has, an, array, of, keys, and, each, one, causes, a, different, single, character, to, be, produced, on, paper, by, striking, an, inked, ribbon, selectively, against, the, paper, with, a, type, element, thereby, the, machine, produces, a, legible, written, document, composed, of, ink, and, paper, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, person, who, used, such, a, device, was, also, referred, to, as, a, type, writer, the, first, commercial, typewriters, were, introduced, in, 1874, but, did, not, become, common, in, offices, in, the, united, states, until, after, the, mid, 1880s, the, typewriter, quickly, became, an, indispensable, tool, for, practically, all, writing, other, than, personal, handwritten, correspondence, it, was, widely, used, by, professional, writers, in, offices, in, business, correspondence, in, private, homes, and, by, students, preparing, written, assignments, typewriters, were, a, standard, fixture, in, most, offices, up, to, the, 1980s, after, that, they, began, to, be, largely, supplanted, by, personal, computers, running, word, processing, software, nevertheless, typewriters, remain, common, in, some, parts, of, the, world, for, example, typewriters, are, still, used, in, many, indian, cities, and, towns, especially, in, roadside, and, legal, offices, due, to, a, lack, of, continuous, reliable, electricity, the, qwerty, keyboard, layout, developed, for, typewriters, in, the, 1870s, remains, the, de, facto, standard, for, english, language, computer, keyboards, the, origins, of, this, layout, still, need, to, be, clarified, similar, typewriter, keyboards, with, layouts, optimised, for, other, languages, and, orthographies, emerged, soon, afterward, and, their, layouts, have, also, become, standard, for, computer, keyboards, in, their, respective, markets, although, many, modern, typewriters, have, one, of, several, similar, designs, their, invention, was, incremental, developed, by, numerous, inventors, working, independently, or, in, competition, with, each, other, over, a, series, of, decades, as, with, the, automobile, the, telephone, and, telegraph, several, people, contributed, insights, and, inventions, that, eventually, resulted, in, ever, more, commercially, successful, instruments, historians, have, estimated, that, some, form, of, the, typewriter, was, invented, 52, times, as, thinkers, and, tinkerers, tried, to, come, up, with, a, workable, design, some, early, typing, instruments, include, by, the, mid, 19th, century, the, increasing, pace, of, business, communication, had, created, a, need, to, mechanize, the, writing, process, stenographers, and, telegraphers, could, take, down, information, at, rates, up, to, 130, words, per, minute, whereas, a, writer, with, a, pen, was, limited, to, a, maximum, of, 30, words, per, minute, the, 1853, speed, record, from, 1829, to, 1870, many, printing, or, typing, machines, were, patented, by, inventors, in, europe, and, america, but, none, went, into, commercial, production, after, the, market, had, matured, under, the, market, dominance, of, large, companies, from, britain, europe, and, the, united, states, but, before, the, advent, of, daisywheel, and, electronic, machines, the, typewriter, market, faced, strong, competition, from, less, expensive, typewriters, from, asia, including, brother, industries, and, silver, seiko, ltd, of, japan, in, 1865, rev, rasmus, malling, hansen, of, denmark, invented, the, hansen, writing, ball, which, went, into, commercial, production, in, 1870, and, was, the, first, commercially, sold, typewriter, it, was, a, success, in, europe, and, was, reported, as, being, used, in, offices, on, the, european, continent, as, late, as, 1909, malling, hansen, used, a, solenoid, escapement, to, return, the, carriage, on, some, of, his, models, which, makes, him, a, candidate, for, the, title, of, inventor, of, the, first, electric, typewriter, the, hansen, writing, ball, was, produced, with, only, upper, case, characters, the, writing, ball, was, a, template, for, inventor, frank, haven, hall, to, create, a, derivative, that, would, produce, letter, prints, cheaper, and, faster, malling, hansen, developed, his, typewriter, further, through, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, and, made, many, improvements, but, the, writing, head, remained, the, same, on, the, first, model, of, the, writing, ball, from, 1870, the, paper, was, attached, to, a, cylinder, inside, a, wooden, box, in, 1874, the, cylinder, was, replaced, by, a, carriage, moving, beneath, the, writing, head, then, in, 1875, the, well, known, tall, model, was, patented, which, was, the, first, of, the, writing, balls, that, worked, without, electricity, malling, hansen, attended, the, world, exhibitions, in, vienna, in, 1873, and, paris, in, 1878, and, he, received, the, first, prize, for, his, invention, at, both, exhibitions, the, first, typewriter, to, be, commercially, successful, was, patented, in, 1868, by, americans, christopher, latham, sholes, frank, haven, hall, carlos, glidden, and, samuel, w, soule, in, milwaukee, wisconsin, although, sholes, soon, disowned, the, machine, and, refused, to, use, or, even, recommend, it, the, working, prototype, was, made, by, clock, maker, and, machinist, matthias, schwalbach, hall, glidden, and, soule, sold, their, shares, in, the, patent, us, 79, 265, to, densmore, and, sholes, who, made, an, agreement, with, e, remington, and, sons, then, famous, as, a, manufacturer, of, sewing, machines, to, commercialize, the, machine, as, the, sholes, and, glidden, type, writer, this, was, the, origin, of, the, term, typewriter, remington, began, production, of, its, first, typewriter, on, march, 1, 1873, in, ilion, new, york, it, had, a, qwerty, keyboard, layout, which, because, of, the, machine, s, success, was, slowly, adopted, by, other, typewriter, manufacturers, as, with, most, other, early, typewriters, because, the, typebars, strike, upwards, the, typist, could, not, see, the, characters, as, they, were, typed, the, index, typewriter, came, into, the, market, in, the, early, 1880s, the, index, typewriter, uses, a, pointer, or, stylus, to, choose, a, letter, from, an, index, the, pointer, is, mechanically, linked, so, that, the, letter, chosen, could, then, be, printed, most, often, by, the, activation, of, a, lever, the, index, typewriter, was, briefly, popular, in, niche, markets, although, they, were, slower, than, keyboard, type, machines, they, were, mechanically, simpler, and, lighter, they, were, therefore, marketed, as, being, suitable, for, travellers, and, because, they, could, be, produced, more, cheaply, than, keyboard, machines, as, budget, machines, for, users, who, needed, to, produce, small, quantities, of, typed, correspondence, for, example, the, simplex, typewriter, company, made, index, typewriters, for, 1, 40, the, price, of, a, remington, typewriter, the, index, typewriter, s, niche, appeal, however, soon, disappeared, as, on, the, one, hand, new, keyboard, typewriters, became, lighter, and, more, portable, and, on, the, other, refurbished, second, hand, machines, began, to, become, available, the, last, widely, available, western, index, machine, was, the, mignon, typewriter, produced, by, aeg, which, was, produced, until, 1934, considered, one, of, the, very, best, of, the, index, typewriters, part, of, the, mignon, s, popularity, was, that, it, featured, interchangeable, indexes, as, well, as, type, fonts, and, character, sets, this, is, something, very, few, keyboard, machines, were, capable, of, and, only, at, considerable, added, cost, although, they, were, pushed, out, of, the, market, in, most, of, the, world, by, keyboard, machines, successful, japanese, and, chinese, typewriters, typewriters, are, of, the, index, type, albeit, with, a, very, much, larger, index, and, number, of, type, elements, embossing, tape, label, makers, are, the, most, common, index, typewriters, today, and, perhaps, the, most, common, typewriters, of, any, kind, still, being, manufactured, the, platen, was, mounted, on, a, carriage, that, moved, horizontally, to, the, left, automatically, advancing, the, typing, position, after, each, character, was, typed, the, carriage, return, lever, at, the, far, left, was, then, pressed, to, the, right, to, return, the, carriage, to, its, starting, position, and, rotating, the, platen, to, advance, the, paper, vertically, a, small, bell, was, struck, a, few, characters, before, the, right, hand, margin, was, reached, to, warn, the, operator, to, complete, the, word, and, then, use, the, carriage, return, lever, by, about, 1910, the, manual, or, mechanical, typewriter, had, reached, a, somewhat, standardized, design, there, were, minor, variations, from, one, manufacturer, to, another, but, most, typewriters, followed, the, concept, that, each, key, was, attached, to, a, typebar, that, had, the, corresponding, letter, molded, in, reverse, into, its, striking, head, when, a, key, was, struck, briskly, and, firmly, the, typebar, hit, a, ribbon, usually, made, of, inked, fabric, making, a, printed, mark, on, the, paper, wrapped, around, a, cylindrical, platen, the, platen, was, mounted, on, a, carriage, that, moved, horizontally, to, the, left, automatically, advancing, the, typing, position, after, each, character, was, typed, the, carriage, return, lever, at, the, far, left, was, then, pressed, to, the, right, to, return, the, carriage, to, its, starting, position, and, rotating, the, platen, to, advance, the, paper, vertically, a, small, bell, was, struck, a, few, characters, before, the, right, hand, margin, was, reached, to, warn, the, operator, to, complete, the, word, and, then, use, the, carriage, return, lever, typewriters, for, languages, written, right, to, left, operate, in, the, opposite, direction, in, most, of, the, early, typewriters, the, typebars, struck, upward, against, the, paper, pressed, against, the, bottom, of, the, platen, so, the, typist, could, not, see, the, text, as, it, was, typed, what, was, typed, was, not, visible, until, a, carriage, return, caused, it, to, scroll, into, view, the, difficulty, with, any, other, arrangement, was, ensuring, the, typebars, fell, back, into, place, reliably, when, the, key, was, released, this, was, eventually, achieved, with, various, ingenious, mechanical, designs, and, so, called, visible, typewriters, which, used, frontstriking, in, which, the, typebars, struck, forward, against, the, front, side, of, the, platen, became, standard, one, of, the, first, was, the, daugherty, visible, introduced, in, 1893, which, also, introduced, the, four, bank, keyboard, that, became, standard, although, the, underwood, which, came, out, two, years, later, was, the, first, major, typewriter, with, these, features, a, significant, innovation, was, the, shift, key, introduced, with, the, remington, no, 2, in, 1878, this, key, physically, shifted, either, the, basket, of, typebars, in, which, case, the, typewriter, is, described, as, basket, shift, or, the, paper, holding, carriage, in, which, case, the, typewriter, is, described, as, carriage, shift, either, mechanism, caused, a, different, portion, of, the, typebar, to, come, in, contact, with, the, ribbon, platen, the, result, is, that, each, typebar, could, type, two, different, characters, cutting, the, number, of, keys, and, typebars, in, half, and, simplifying, the, internal, mechanisms, considerably, the, obvious, use, for, this, was, to, allow, letter, keys, to, type, both, upper, and, lower, case, but, normally, the, number, keys, were, also, duplexed, allowing, access, to, special, symbols, such, as, percent, and, ampersand, before, the, shift, key, typewriters, had, to, have, a, separate, key, and, typebar, for, upper, case, letters, in, essence, the, typewriter, had, two, keyboards, one, above, the, other, with, the, shift, key, manufacturing, costs, and, therefore, purchase, price, were, greatly, reduced, and, typist, operation, was, simplified, both, factors, contributed, greatly, to, mass, adoption, of, the, technology, certain, models, further, reduced, the, number, of, keys, and, typebars, by, making, each, key, perform, three, functions, each, typebar, could, type, three, different, characters, these, little, three, row, machines, were, portable, and, could, be, used, by, journalists, such, three, row, machines, were, popular, with, wwi, journalists, because, they, were, lighter, and, more, compact, than, four, bank, typewriters, while, they, could, type, just, as, fast, and, use, just, as, many, symbols, such, three, row, machines, such, as, the, bar, let, and, the, corona, no, 3, typewriter, have, two, separate, shift, keys, a, cap, shift, for, uppercase, and, a, fig, shift, for, numbers, and, symbols, the, murray, code, was, developed, for, a, teletypewriter, with, a, similar, three, row, typewriter, keyboard, to, facilitate, typewriter, use, in, business, settings, a, tab, tabulator, key, was, added, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, before, using, the, key, the, operator, had, to, set, mechanical, tab, stops, pre, designated, locations, to, which, the, carriage, would, advance, when, the, tab, key, was, pressed, this, facilitated, the, typing, of, columns, of, numbers, freeing, the, operator, from, the, need, to, manually, position, the, carriage, the, first, models, had, one, tab, stop, and, one, tab, key, later, ones, allowed, as, many, stops, as, desired, and, sometimes, had, multiple, tab, keys, each, of, which, moved, the, carriage, a, different, number, of, spaces, ahead, of, the, decimal, point, the, tab, stop, to, facilitate, the, typing, of, columns, with, numbers, of, different, length, 1, 00, 10, 00, 100, 00, etc, languages, such, as, french, spanish, and, german, required, diacritics, special, signs, attached, to, or, on, top, of, the, base, letter, for, example, a, combination, of, the, acute, accent, plus, e, produced, plus, n, produced, in, metal, typesetting, and, others, were, separate, sorts, with, mechanical, typewriters, the, number, of, whose, characters, sorts, was, constrained, by, the, physical, limits, of, the, machine, the, number, of, keys, required, was, reduced, by, the, use, of, dead, keys, diacritics, such, as, acute, accent, would, be, assigned, to, a, dead, key, which, did, not, move, the, platen, forward, permitting, another, character, to, be, imprinted, at, the, same, location, thus, a, single, dead, key, such, as, the, acute, accent, could, be, combined, with, a, e, i, o, and, u, to, produce, and, reducing, the, number, of, sorts, needed, from, 5, to, 1, the, typebars, of, normal, characters, struck, a, rod, as, they, moved, the, metal, character, desired, toward, the, ribbon, and, platen, and, each, rod, depression, moved, the, platen, forward, the, width, of, one, character, dead, keys, had, a, typebar, shaped, so, as, not, to, strike, the, rod, in, english, speaking, countries, ordinary, typewriters, printing, fixed, width, characters, were, standardized, to, print, six, horizontal, lines, per, vertical, inch, and, had, either, of, two, variants, of, character, width, one, called, pica, for, ten, characters, per, horizontal, inch, and, the, other, elite, for, twelve, this, differed, from, the, use, of, these, terms, in, printing, where, pica, is, a, linear, unit, approximately, 1, 6, of, an, inch, used, for, any, measurement, the, most, common, one, being, the, height, of, a, typeface, some, ribbons, were, inked, in, black, and, red, stripes, each, being, half, the, width, and, running, the, entire, length, of, the, ribbon, a, lever, on, most, machines, allowed, switching, between, colors, which, was, useful, for, bookkeeping, entries, where, negative, amounts, were, highlighted, in, red, the, red, color, was, also, used, on, some, selected, characters, in, running, text, for, emphasis, when, a, typewriter, had, this, facility, it, could, still, be, fitted, with, a, solid, black, ribbon, the, lever, was, then, used, to, switch, to, fresh, ribbon, when, the, first, stripe, ran, out, of, ink, some, typewriters, also, had, a, third, position, which, stopped, the, ribbon, being, struck, at, all, this, enabled, the, keys, to, hit, the, paper, unobstructed, and, was, used, for, cutting, stencils, for, stencil, duplicators, aka, mimeograph, machines, the, first, typewriter, to, have, the, sliding, type, bars, laid, out, horizontally, like, a, fan, that, enable, a, typewriter, to, be, noiseless, was, the, american, made, rapid, which, appeared, briefly, on, the, market, in, 1890, the, rapid, also, had, the, remarkable, ability, for, the, typist, to, have, entire, control, of, the, carriage, by, manipulation, of, the, keyboard, alone, the, two, keys, that, achieve, this, are, positioned, at, the, top, of, the, keyboard, seen, in, the, detail, image, below, they, are, a, lift, key, that, advances, the, paper, on, the, platen, to, the, next, line, and, a, return, key, that, causes, the, carriage, to, automatically, swing, back, to, the, right, ready, for, one, to, type, the, new, line, so, an, entire, page, could, be, typed, without, one, s, hands, leaving, the, keyboard, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, a, typewriter, was, marketed, under, the, name, noiseless, and, advertised, as, silent, it, was, developed, by, wellington, parker, kidder, and, the, first, model, was, marketed, by, the, noiseless, typewriter, company, in, 1917, noiseless, portables, sold, well, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, and, noiseless, standards, continued, to, be, manufactured, until, the, 1960s, in, a, conventional, typewriter, the, type, bar, reaches, the, end, of, its, travel, simply, by, striking, the, ribbon, and, paper, the, noiseless, developed, by, kidder, has, a, complex, lever, mechanism, that, decelerates, the, type, bar, mechanically, before, pressing, it, against, the, ribbon, and, paper, in, an, attempt, to, dampen, the, noise, although, electric, typewriters, would, not, achieve, widespread, popularity, until, nearly, a, century, later, the, basic, groundwork, for, the, electric, typewriter, was, laid, by, the, universal, stock, ticker, invented, by, thomas, edison, in, 1870, this, device, remotely, printed, letters, and, numbers, on, a, stream, of, paper, tape, from, input, generated, by, a, specially, designed, typewriter, at, the, other, end, of, a, telegraph, line, some, electric, typewriters, were, patented, in, the, 19th, century, but, the, first, machine, known, to, be, produced, in, series, is, the, cahill, of, 1900, another, electric, typewriter, was, produced, by, the, blickensderfer, manufacturing, company, of, stamford, connecticut, in, 1902, like, the, manual, blickensderfer, typewriters, it, used, a, cylindrical, typewheel, rather, than, individual, typebars, the, machine, was, produced, in, several, variants, but, apparently, not, a, commercial, success, having, come, to, market, ahead, of, its, time, before, ubiquitous, electrification, the, next, step, in, the, development, of, the, electric, typewriter, came, in, 1910, when, charles, and, howard, krum, filed, a, patent, for, the, first, practical, teletypewriter, the, krums, machine, named, the, morkrum, printing, telegraph, used, a, typewheel, rather, than, individual, typebars, this, machine, was, used, for, the, first, commercial, teletypewriter, system, on, postal, telegraph, company, lines, between, boston, and, new, york, city, in, 1910, james, fields, smathers, of, kansas, city, invented, what, is, considered, the, first, practical, power, operated, typewriter, in, 1914, in, 1920, after, returning, from, army, service, he, produced, a, successful, model, and, in, 1923, turned, it, over, to, the, northeast, electric, company, of, rochester, for, development, northeast, was, interested, in, finding, new, markets, for, their, electric, motors, and, developed, smathers, s, design, so, that, it, could, be, marketed, to, typewriter, manufacturers, and, from, 1925, remington, electric, typewriters, were, produced, powered, by, northeast, s, motors, after, some, 2, 500, electric, typewriters, had, been, produced, northeast, asked, remington, for, a, firm, contract, for, the, next, batch, however, remington, was, engaged, in, merger, talks, which, would, eventually, result, in, the, creation, of, remington, rand, and, no, executives, were, willing, to, commit, to, a, firm, order, northeast, instead, decided, to, enter, the, typewriter, business, for, itself, and, in, 1929, produced, the, first, electromatic, typewriter, in, 1928, delco, a, division, of, general, motors, purchased, northeast, electric, and, the, typewriter, business, was, spun, off, as, electromatic, typewriters, inc, in, 1933, electromatic, was, acquired, by, ibm, which, then, spent, 1, million, on, a, redesign, of, the, electromatic, typewriter, launching, the, ibm, electric, typewriter, model, 01, in, 1931, an, electric, typewriter, was, introduced, by, varityper, corporation, it, was, called, the, varityper, because, a, narrow, cylinder, like, wheel, could, be, replaced, to, change, the, font, in, 1941, ibm, announced, the, electromatic, model, 04, electric, typewriter, featuring, the, revolutionary, concept, of, proportional, spacing, by, assigning, varied, rather, than, uniform, spacing, to, different, sized, characters, the, type, 4, recreated, the, appearance, of, a, typeset, page, an, effect, that, was, further, enhanced, by, including, the, 1937, innovation, of, carbon, film, ribbons, that, produced, clearer, sharper, words, on, the, page, ibm, introduced, the, ibm, selectric, typewriter, in, 1961, which, replaced, the, typebars, with, a, spherical, element, or, typeball, slightly, smaller, than, a, golf, ball, with, reverse, image, letters, molded, into, its, surface, the, selectric, used, a, system, of, latches, metal, tapes, and, pulleys, driven, by, an, electric, motor, to, rotate, the, ball, into, the, correct, position, and, then, strike, it, against, the, ribbon, and, platen, the, typeball, moved, laterally, in, front, of, the, paper, instead, of, the, previous, designs, using, a, platen, carrying, carriage, moving, the, paper, across, a, stationary, print, position, due, to, the, physical, similarity, the, typeball, was, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, golfball, the, typeball, design, had, many, advantages, especially, the, elimination, of, jams, when, more, than, one, key, was, struck, at, once, and, the, typebars, became, entangled, and, in, the, ability, to, change, the, typeball, allowing, multiple, fonts, to, be, used, in, a, single, document, the, ibm, selectric, became, a, commercial, success, dominating, the, office, typewriter, market, for, at, least, two, decades, ibm, also, gained, an, advantage, by, marketing, more, heavily, to, schools, than, did, remington, with, the, idea, that, students, who, learned, to, type, on, a, selectric, would, later, choose, ibm, typewriters, over, the, competition, in, the, workplace, as, businesses, replaced, their, old, manual, models, later, models, of, ibm, executives, and, selectrics, replaced, inked, fabric, ribbons, with, carbon, film, ribbons, that, had, a, dry, black, or, colored, powder, on, a, clear, plastic, tape, these, could, be, used, only, once, but, later, models, used, a, cartridge, that, was, simple, to, replace, a, side, effect, of, this, technology, was, that, the, text, typed, on, the, machine, could, be, easily, read, from, the, used, ribbon, raising, issues, where, the, machines, were, used, for, preparing, classified, documents, ribbons, had, to, be, accounted, for, to, ensure, that, typists, did, not, carry, them, from, the, facility, a, variation, known, as, correcting, selectrics, introduced, a, correction, feature, later, imitated, by, competing, machines, where, a, sticky, tape, in, front, of, the, carbon, film, ribbon, could, remove, the, black, powdered, image, of, a, typed, character, eliminating, the, need, for, little, bottles, of, white, dab, on, correction, fluid, and, for, hard, erasers, that, could, tear, the, paper, these, machines, also, introduced, selectable, pitch, so, that, the, typewriter, could, be, switched, between, pica, type, 10, characters, per, inch, and, elite, type, 12, per, inch, even, within, one, document, even, so, all, selectrics, were, monospaced, each, character, and, letterspace, was, allotted, the, same, width, on, the, page, from, a, capital, w, to, a, period, ibm, did, produce, a, successful, typebar, based, machine, with, five, levels, of, proportional, spacing, called, the, ibm, executive, the, only, fully, electromechanical, selectric, typewriter, with, fully, proportional, spacing, and, which, used, a, selectric, type, element, was, the, expensive, selectric, composer, which, was, capable, of, right, margin, justification, typing, each, line, twice, was, required, once, to, calculate, and, again, to, print, and, was, considered, a, typesetting, machine, rather, than, a, typewriter, composer, typeballs, physically, resembled, those, of, the, selectric, typewriter, but, were, not, interchangeable, in, addition, to, its, electronic, successors, the, magnetic, tape, selectric, composer, mt, sc, the, mag, card, selectric, composer, and, the, electronic, selectric, composer, ibm, also, made, electronic, typewriters, with, proportional, spacing, using, the, selectric, element, that, were, considered, typewriters, or, word, processors, instead, of, typesetting, machines, the, first, of, these, was, the, relatively, obscure, mag, card, executive, which, used, 88, character, elements, later, some, of, the, same, typestyles, used, for, it, were, used, on, the, 96, character, elements, used, on, the, ibm, electronic, typewriter, 50, and, the, later, models, 65, and, 85, by, 1970, as, offset, printing, began, to, replace, letterpress, printing, the, composer, would, be, adapted, as, the, output, unit, for, a, phototypesetting, system, the, system, included, a, computer, driven, input, station, to, capture, the, key, strokes, on, magnetic, tape, and, insert, the, operator, s, format, commands, and, a, composer, unit, to, read, the, tape, and, produce, the, formatted, text, for, photo, reproduction, the, ibm, 2741, terminal, was, a, popular, example, of, a, selectric, based, computer, terminal, and, similar, mechanisms, were, employed, as, the, console, devices, for, many, ibm, system, 360, computers, these, mechanisms, used, ruggedized, designs, compared, to, those, in, standard, office, typewriters, some, of, ibm, s, advances, were, later, adopted, in, less, expensive, machines, from, competitors, for, example, smith, corona, electric, typewriters, introduced, in, 1973, switched, to, interchangeable, coronamatic, scm, patented, ribbon, cartridges, including, fabric, film, erasing, and, two, color, versions, at, about, the, same, time, the, advent, of, photocopying, meant, that, carbon, copies, correction, fluid, and, erasers, were, less, and, less, necessary, only, the, original, need, be, typed, and, photocopies, made, from, it, the, final, major, development, of, the, typewriter, was, the, electronic, typewriter, most, of, these, replaced, the, typeball, with, a, plastic, or, metal, daisy, wheel, mechanism, a, disk, with, the, letters, molded, on, the, outside, edge, of, the, petals, the, daisy, wheel, concept, first, emerged, in, printers, developed, by, diablo, systems, in, the, 1970s, the, first, electronic, daisywheel, typewriter, marketed, in, the, world, in, 1976, is, the, olivetti, tes, 501, and, subsequently, in, 1978, the, olivetti, et101, with, function, display, and, olivetti, tes, 401, with, text, display, and, floppy, disk, for, memory, storage, this, has, allowed, olivetti, to, maintain, the, world, record, in, the, design, of, electronic, typewriters, proposing, increasingly, advanced, and, performing, models, in, the, following, years, unlike, the, selectrics, and, earlier, models, these, really, were, electronic, and, relied, on, integrated, circuits, and, electromechanical, components, these, typewriters, were, sometimes, called, display, typewriters, dedicated, word, processors, or, word, processing, typewriters, though, the, latter, term, was, also, frequently, applied, to, less, sophisticated, machines, that, featured, only, a, tiny, sometimes, just, single, row, display, sophisticated, models, were, also, called, word, processors, though, today, that, term, almost, always, denotes, a, type, of, software, program, manufacturers, of, such, machines, included, olivetti, tes501, first, totally, electronic, olivetti, word, processor, with, daisywheel, and, floppy, disk, in, 1976, tes621, in, 1979, etc, brother, brother, wp1, and, wp500, etc, where, wp, stood, for, word, processor, canon, canon, cat, smith, corona, pwp, i, e, personal, word, processor, line, and, philips, magnavox, videowriter, the, pace, of, change, was, so, rapid, that, it, was, common, for, clerical, staff, to, have, to, learn, several, new, systems, one, after, the, other, in, just, a, few, years, while, such, rapid, change, is, commonplace, today, and, is, taken, for, granted, this, was, not, always, so, in, fact, typewriting, technology, changed, very, little, in, its, first, 80, or, 90, years, due, to, falling, sales, ibm, sold, its, typewriter, division, in, 1991, to, the, newly, formed, lexmark, completely, exiting, from, a, market, it, once, dominated, the, increasing, dominance, of, personal, computers, desktop, publishing, the, introduction, of, low, cost, truly, high, quality, laser, and, inkjet, printer, technologies, and, the, pervasive, use, of, web, publishing, email, text, messaging, and, other, electronic, communication, techniques, have, largely, replaced, typewriters, in, the, united, states, still, as, of, 2009, typewriters, continued, to, be, used, by, a, number, of, government, agencies, and, other, institutions, in, the, us, where, they, are, primarily, used, to, fill, preprinted, forms, according, to, a, boston, typewriter, repairman, quoted, by, the, boston, globe, every, maternity, ward, has, a, typewriter, as, well, as, funeral, homes, a, rather, specialized, market, for, typewriters, exists, due, to, the, regulations, of, many, correctional, systems, in, the, us, where, prisoners, are, prohibited, from, having, computers, or, telecommunication, equipment, but, are, allowed, to, own, typewriters, the, swintec, corporation, headquartered, in, moonachie, new, jersey, which, as, of, 2011, still, produced, typewriters, at, its, overseas, factories, in, japan, indonesia, and, or, malaysia, manufactures, a, variety, of, typewriters, for, use, in, prisons, made, of, clear, plastic, to, make, it, harder, for, prisoners, to, hide, prohibited, items, inside, it, as, of, 2011, the, company, had, contracts, with, prisons, in, 43, us, states, in, april, 2011, godrej, and, boyce, a, mumbai, based, manufacturer, of, mechanical, typewriters, closed, its, doors, leading, to, a, flurry, of, news, reports, that, the, world, s, last, typewriter, factory, had, shut, down, the, reports, were, quickly, contested, with, opinions, settling, to, agree, that, it, was, indeed, the, world, s, last, producer, of, manual, typewriters, in, november, 2012, brother, s, uk, factory, manufactured, what, it, claimed, to, be, the, last, typewriter, ever, made, in, the, uk, the, typewriter, was, donated, to, the, london, science, museum, russian, typewriters, use, cyrillic, which, has, made, the, ongoing, azerbaijani, reconversion, from, cyrillic, to, latin, alphabet, more, difficult, in, 1997, the, government, of, turkey, offered, to, donate, western, typewriters, to, the, republic, of, azerbaijan, in, exchange, for, more, zealous, and, exclusive, promotion, of, the, latin, alphabet, for, the, azerbaijani, language, this, offer, however, was, declined, in, latin, america, and, africa, mechanical, typewriters, are, still, common, because, they, can, be, used, without, electrical, power, in, latin, america, the, typewriters, used, are, most, often, brazilian, models, brazil, continues, to, produce, mechanical, facit, and, electronic, olivetti, typewriters, to, the, present, day, the, early, 21st, century, saw, revival, of, interest, in, typewriters, among, certain, subcultures, including, makers, steampunks, hipsters, and, street, poets, according, to, the, standards, taught, in, secretarial, schools, in, the, mid, 20th, century, a, business, letter, was, supposed, to, have, no, mistakes, and, no, visible, corrections, the, traditional, erasing, method, involved, the, use, of, a, special, typewriter, eraser, made, of, hard, rubber, that, contained, an, abrasive, material, some, were, thin, flat, disks, pink, or, gray, approximately, 2, inches, 51, mm, in, diameter, by, 1, 8, inch, 3, 2, mm, thick, with, a, brush, attached, from, the, center, while, others, looked, like, pink, pencils, with, a, sharpenable, eraser, at, the, lead, end, and, a, stiff, nylon, brush, at, the, other, end, either, way, these, tools, made, possible, erasure, of, individual, typed, letters, business, letters, were, typed, on, heavyweight, high, rag, content, bond, paper, not, merely, to, provide, a, luxurious, appearance, but, also, to, stand, up, to, erasure, typewriter, eraser, brushes, were, necessary, for, clearing, eraser, crumbs, and, paper, dust, and, using, the, brush, properly, was, an, important, element, of, typewriting, skill, if, erasure, detritus, fell, into, the, typewriter, a, small, buildup, could, cause, the, typebars, to, jam, in, their, narrow, supporting, grooves, erasing, a, set, of, carbon, copies, was, particularly, difficult, and, called, for, the, use, of, a, device, called, an, erasing, shield, or, eraser, shield, a, thin, stainless, steel, rectangle, about, 2, by, 3, inches, 51, by, 76, mm, with, several, tiny, holes, in, it, to, prevent, the, pressure, of, erasing, on, the, upper, copies, from, producing, carbon, smudges, on, the, lower, copies, to, correct, copies, typists, had, to, go, from, one, carbon, copy, layer, to, the, next, carbon, copy, layer, trying, not, to, get, their, fingers, dirty, as, they, leafed, through, the, carbon, papers, and, moving, and, repositioning, the, eraser, shield, and, eraser, for, each, copy, paper, companies, produced, a, special, form, of, typewriter, paper, called, erasable, bond, for, example, eaton, s, corrasable, bond, this, incorporated, a, thin, layer, of, material, that, prevented, ink, from, penetrating, and, was, relatively, soft, and, easy, to, remove, from, the, page, an, ordinary, soft, pencil, eraser, could, quickly, produce, perfect, erasures, on, this, kind, of, paper, however, the, same, characteristics, that, made, the, paper, erasable, made, the, characters, subject, to, smudging, due, to, ordinary, friction, and, deliberate, alteration, after, the, fact, making, it, unacceptable, for, business, correspondence, contracts, or, any, archival, use, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, correction, fluid, made, its, appearance, under, brand, names, such, as, liquid, paper, wite, out, and, tipp, ex, it, was, invented, by, bette, nesmith, graham, correction, fluid, was, a, kind, of, opaque, white, fast, drying, paint, that, produced, a, fresh, white, surface, onto, which, when, dry, a, correction, could, be, retyped, however, when, held, to, the, light, the, covered, up, characters, were, visible, as, was, the, patch, of, dry, correction, fluid, which, was, never, perfectly, flat, and, frequently, not, a, perfect, match, for, the, color, texture, and, luster, of, the, surrounding, paper, the, standard, trick, for, solving, this, problem, was, photocopying, the, corrected, page, but, this, was, possible, only, with, high, quality, photocopiers, a, different, fluid, was, available, for, correcting, stencils, it, sealed, up, the, stencil, ready, for, retyping, but, did, not, attempt, to, color, match, the, 1874, sholes, glidden, typewriters, established, the, qwerty, layout, for, the, letter, keys, during, the, period, in, which, sholes, and, his, colleagues, were, experimenting, with, this, invention, other, keyboard, arrangements, were, apparently, tried, but, these, are, poorly, documented, the, qwerty, layout, of, keys, has, become, the, de, facto, standard, for, english, language, typewriter, and, computer, keyboards, other, languages, written, in, the, latin, alphabet, sometimes, use, variants, of, the, qwerty, layouts, such, as, the, french, azerty, the, italian, qzerty, and, the, german, qwertz, layouts, the, qwerty, layout, is, not, the, most, efficient, layout, possible, for, the, english, language, touch, typists, are, required, to, move, their, fingers, between, rows, to, type, the, most, common, letters, although, the, qwerty, keyboard, was, the, most, commonly, used, layout, in, typewriters, a, better, less, strenuous, keyboard, was, being, searched, for, throughout, the, late, 1900s, one, popular, but, incorrect, explanation, for, the, qwerty, arrangement, is, that, it, was, designed, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, internal, clashing, of, typebars, by, placing, commonly, used, combinations, of, letters, farther, from, each, other, inside, the, machine, a, number, of, radically, different, layouts, such, as, dvorak, have, been, proposed, to, reduce, the, perceived, inefficiencies, of, qwerty, but, none, have, been, able, to, displace, the, qwerty, layout, their, proponents, claim, considerable, advantages, but, so, far, none, has, been, widely, used, the, blickensderfer, typewriter, with, its, dhiatensor, layout, may, have, possibly, been, the, first, attempt, at, optimizing, the, keyboard, layout, for, efficiency, advantages, on, modern, keyboards, the, exclamation, point, is, the, shifted, character, on, the, 1, key, because, these, were, the, last, characters, to, become, standard, on, keyboards, holding, the, spacebar, down, usually, suspended, the, carriage, advance, mechanism, a, so, called, dead, key, feature, allowing, one, to, superimpose, multiple, keystrikes, on, a, single, location, the, symbol, meaning, cents, was, located, above, the, number, 6, on, american, electric, typewriters, whereas, ansi, incits, standard, computer, keyboards, have, instead, the, keyboards, for, other, latin, languages, are, broadly, similar, to, qwerty, but, are, optimised, for, the, relevant, orthography, in, addition, to, some, changes, in, the, order, of, letters, perhaps, the, most, obvious, is, the, presence, of, precomposed, characters, and, diacritics, many, non, latin, alphabets, have, keyboard, layouts, that, have, nothing, to, do, with, qwerty, the, russian, layout, for, instance, puts, the, common, trigrams, and, on, adjacent, keys, so, that, they, can, be, typed, by, rolling, the, fingers, typewriters, were, also, made, for, east, asian, languages, with, thousands, of, characters, such, as, chinese, or, japanese, they, were, not, easy, to, operate, but, professional, typists, used, them, for, a, long, time, until, the, development, of, electronic, word, processors, and, laser, printers, in, the, 1980s, a, number, of, typographical, conventions, stem, from, the, typewriter, s, characteristics, and, limitations, for, example, the, qwerty, keyboard, typewriter, did, not, include, keys, for, the, en, dash, and, the, em, dash, to, overcome, this, limitation, users, typically, typed, more, than, one, adjacent, hyphen, to, approximate, these, symbols, this, typewriter, convention, is, still, sometimes, used, today, even, though, modern, computer, word, processing, applications, can, input, the, correct, en, and, em, dashes, for, each, font, type, other, examples, of, typewriter, practices, that, are, sometimes, still, used, in, desktop, publishing, systems, include, inserting, a, double, space, between, sentences, and, the, use, of, the, typewriter, apostrophe, and, straight, quotes, as, quotation, marks, and, prime, marks, the, practice, of, underlining, text, in, place, of, italics, and, the, use, of, all, capitals, to, provide, emphasis, are, additional, examples, of, typographical, conventions, that, derived, from, the, limitations, of, the, typewriter, keyboard, that, still, carry, on, today, many, older, typewriters, did, not, include, a, separate, key, for, the, numeral, 1, or, the, exclamation, point, and, some, even, older, ones, also, lacked, the, numeral, zero, 0, typists, who, trained, on, these, machines, learned, the, habit, of, using, the, lowercase, letter, l, ell, for, the, digit, 1, and, the, uppercase, o, oh, for, the, zero, a, cents, symbol, was, created, by, combining, over, striking, a, lower, case, c, with, a, slash, character, typing, c, then, backspace, then, similarly, the, exclamation, point, was, created, by, combining, an, apostrophe, and, a, period, some, terminology, from, the, typewriter, age, has, survived, into, the, computer, era, when, remington, started, marketing, typewriters, the, company, assumed, the, machine, would, not, be, used, for, composing, but, for, transcribing, dictation, and, that, the, person, typing, would, be, a, woman, the, 1800s, sholes, and, glidden, typewriter, had, floral, ornamentation, on, the, case, during, world, wars, i, and, ii, increasing, numbers, of, women, were, entering, the, workforce, in, the, united, states, women, often, started, in, the, professional, workplace, as, copy, typists, being, a, typist, was, considered, the, right, choice, for, a, good, girl, meaning, women, who, present, themselves, as, being, chaste, and, having, good, conduct, according, to, the, 1900, census, 94, 9, of, stenographers, and, typists, were, unmarried, women, this, also, led, to, an, increase, in, schools, and, classes, for, typing, in, order, to, prepare, for, a, future, job, moreover, the, word, typewriter, also, became, associated, with, the, women, who, typed, during, the, timeperiod, questions, about, morals, made, a, salacious, businessman, making, sexual, advances, to, a, female, typist, into, a, clich, of, office, life, appearing, in, vaudeville, and, movies, the, tijuana, bibles, adult, comic, books, produced, in, mexico, for, the, american, market, starting, in, the, 1930s, often, featured, women, typists, in, one, panel, a, businessman, in, a, three, piece, suit, ogling, his, secretary, s, thigh, says, miss, higby, are, you, ready, for, ahem, er, dictation, the, typewriter, was, a, useful, machine, during, the, censorship, era, of, the, soviet, government, starting, during, the, russian, civil, war, 1917, 1922, samizdat, was, a, form, of, surreptitious, self, publication, used, when, the, government, was, censoring, what, literature, the, public, could, see, the, soviet, government, signed, a, decree, on, press, which, prohibited, the, publishing, of, any, written, work, that, had, not, been, previously, officially, reviewed, and, approved, unapproved, work, was, copied, manually, most, often, on, typewriters, in, 1983, a, new, law, required, anyone, who, needed, a, typewriter, to, get, police, permission, to, buy, or, keep, one, in, addition, the, owner, would, have, to, register, a, typed, sample, of, all, its, letters, and, numbers, to, ensure, that, any, illegal, literature, typed, with, it, could, be, traced, back, to, its, source, the, typewriter, became, increasingly, popular, as, the, interest, in, prohibited, books, grew, typewritten, documents, may, be, examined, by, forensic, document, examiners, this, is, done, primarily, to, determine, 1, the, make, and, or, model, of, the, typewriter, used, to, produce, a, document, or, 2, whether, or, not, a, particular, suspect, typewriter, might, have, been, used, to, produce, a, document, the, determination, of, a, make, and, or, model, of, typewriter, is, a, classification, problem, and, several, systems, have, been, developed, for, this, purpose, these, include, the, original, haas, typewriter, atlases, pica, version, and, non, pica, version, and, the, type, system, developed, by, philip, bouffard, the, royal, canadian, mounted, police, s, termatrex, typewriter, classification, system, and, interpol, s, typewriter, classification, system, among, others, the, earliest, reference, in, fictional, literature, to, the, potential, identification, of, a, typewriter, as, having, produced, a, document, was, by, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, who, wrote, the, sherlock, holmes, short, story, a, case, of, identity, in, 1891, in, non, fiction, the, first, document, examiner, to, describe, how, a, typewriter, might, be, identified, was, william, e, hagan, who, wrote, in, 1894, all, typewriter, machines, even, when, using, the, same, kind, of, type, become, more, or, less, peculiar, by, use, as, to, the, work, done, by, them, other, early, discussions, of, the, topic, were, provided, by, a, s, osborn, in, his, 1908, treatise, typewriting, as, evidence, and, again, in, his, 1929, textbook, questioned, documents, a, modern, description, of, the, examination, procedure, is, laid, out, in, astm, standard, e2494, 08, standard, guide, for, examination, of, typewritten, items, typewriter, examination, was, used, in, the, leopold, and, loeb, and, alger, hiss, cases, in, the, eastern, bloc, typewriters, together, with, printing, presses, copy, machines, and, later, computer, printers, were, a, controlled, technology, with, secret, police, in, charge, of, maintaining, records, of, the, typewriters, and, their, owners, in, the, soviet, union, the, first, department, of, each, organization, sent, data, on, organization, s, typewriters, to, the, kgb, this, posed, a, significant, risk, for, dissidents, and, samizdat, authors, in, romania, according, to, state, council, decree, no, 98, of, march, 28, 1983, owning, a, typewriter, both, by, businesses, or, by, private, persons, was, subject, to, an, approval, given, by, the, local, police, authorities, people, previously, convicted, of, any, crime, or, those, who, because, of, their, behaviour, were, considered, to, be, a, danger, to, public, order, or, to, the, security, of, the, state, were, refused, approval, in, addition, once, a, year, typewriter, owners, had, to, take, the, typewriter, to, the, local, police, station, where, they, would, be, asked, to, type, a, sample, of, all, the, typewriter, s, characters, it, was, also, forbidden, to, borrow, lend, or, repair, typewriters, other, than, at, the, places, that, had, been, authorized, by, the, police, public, and, private, collections, of, typewriters, exist, around, the, world, including, several, online, only, virtual, museums, collect, and, display, information, about, typewriters, and, their, history
