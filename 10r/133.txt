an, amplifier, electronic, amplifier, or, informally, amp, is, an, electronic, device, that, can, increase, the, magnitude, of, a, signal, a, time, varying, voltage, or, current, it, is, a, two, port, electronic, circuit, that, uses, electric, power, from, a, power, supply, to, increase, the, amplitude, magnitude, of, the, voltage, or, current, of, a, signal, applied, to, its, input, terminals, producing, a, proportionally, greater, amplitude, signal, at, its, output, the, amount, of, amplification, provided, by, an, amplifier, is, measured, by, its, gain, the, ratio, of, output, voltage, current, or, power, to, input, an, amplifier, is, defined, as, a, circuit, that, has, a, power, gain, greater, than, one, an, amplifier, can, be, either, a, separate, piece, of, equipment, or, an, electrical, circuit, contained, within, another, device, amplification, is, fundamental, to, modern, electronics, and, amplifiers, are, widely, used, in, almost, all, electronic, equipment, amplifiers, can, be, categorized, in, different, ways, one, is, by, the, frequency, of, the, electronic, signal, being, amplified, for, example, audio, amplifiers, amplify, signals, in, the, audio, sound, range, of, less, than, 20, khz, rf, amplifiers, amplify, frequencies, in, the, radio, frequency, range, between, 20, khz, and, 300, ghz, and, servo, amplifiers, and, instrumentation, amplifiers, may, work, with, very, low, frequencies, down, to, direct, current, amplifiers, can, also, be, categorized, by, their, physical, placement, in, the, signal, chain, a, preamplifier, may, precede, other, signal, processing, stages, for, example, while, a, power, amplifier, is, usually, used, after, other, amplifier, stages, to, provide, enough, output, power, for, the, final, use, of, the, signal, the, first, practical, electrical, device, which, could, amplify, was, the, triode, vacuum, tube, invented, in, 1906, by, lee, de, forest, which, led, to, the, first, amplifiers, around, 1912, today, most, amplifiers, use, transistors, the, first, practical, prominent, device, that, could, amplify, was, the, triode, vacuum, tube, invented, in, 1906, by, lee, de, forest, which, led, to, the, first, amplifiers, around, 1912, vacuum, tubes, were, used, in, almost, all, amplifiers, until, the, 1960s, 1970s, when, transistors, replaced, them, today, most, amplifiers, use, transistors, but, vacuum, tubes, continue, to, be, used, in, some, applications, the, development, of, audio, communication, technology, in, form, of, the, telephone, first, patented, in, 1876, created, the, need, to, increase, the, amplitude, of, electrical, signals, to, extend, the, transmission, of, signals, over, increasingly, long, distances, in, telegraphy, this, problem, had, been, solved, with, intermediate, devices, at, stations, that, replenished, the, dissipated, energy, by, operating, a, signal, recorder, and, transmitter, back, to, back, forming, a, relay, so, that, a, local, energy, source, at, each, intermediate, station, powered, the, next, leg, of, transmission, for, duplex, transmission, i, e, sending, and, receiving, in, both, directions, bi, directional, relay, repeaters, were, developed, starting, with, the, work, of, c, f, varley, for, telegraphic, transmission, duplex, transmission, was, essential, for, telephony, and, the, problem, was, not, satisfactorily, solved, until, 1904, when, h, e, shreeve, of, the, american, telephone, and, telegraph, company, improved, existing, attempts, at, constructing, a, telephone, repeater, consisting, of, back, to, back, carbon, granule, transmitter, and, electrodynamic, receiver, pairs, the, shreeve, repeater, was, first, tested, on, a, line, between, boston, and, amesbury, ma, and, more, refined, devices, remained, in, service, for, some, time, after, the, turn, of, the, century, it, was, found, that, negative, resistance, mercury, lamps, could, amplify, and, were, also, tried, in, repeaters, with, little, success, the, development, of, thermionic, valves, which, began, around, 1902, provided, an, entirely, electronic, method, of, amplifying, signals, the, first, practical, version, of, such, devices, was, the, audion, triode, invented, in, 1906, by, lee, de, forest, which, led, to, the, first, amplifiers, around, 1912, since, the, only, previous, device, which, was, widely, used, to, strengthen, a, signal, was, the, relay, used, in, telegraph, systems, the, amplifying, vacuum, tube, was, first, called, an, electron, relay, the, terms, amplifier, and, amplification, derived, from, the, latin, amplificare, to, enlarge, or, expand, were, first, used, for, this, new, capability, around, 1915, when, triodes, became, widespread, the, amplifying, vacuum, tube, revolutionized, electrical, technology, it, made, possible, long, distance, telephone, lines, public, address, systems, radio, broadcasting, talking, motion, pictures, practical, audio, recording, radar, television, and, the, first, computers, for, 50, years, virtually, all, consumer, electronic, devices, used, vacuum, tubes, early, tube, amplifiers, often, had, positive, feedback, regeneration, which, could, increase, gain, but, also, make, the, amplifier, unstable, and, prone, to, oscillation, much, of, the, mathematical, theory, of, amplifiers, was, developed, at, bell, telephone, laboratories, during, the, 1920s, to, 1940s, distortion, levels, in, early, amplifiers, were, high, usually, around, 5, until, 1934, when, harold, black, developed, negative, feedback, this, allowed, the, distortion, levels, to, be, greatly, reduced, at, the, cost, of, lower, gain, other, advances, in, the, theory, of, amplification, were, made, by, harry, nyquist, and, hendrik, wade, bode, the, vacuum, tube, was, virtually, the, only, amplifying, device, other, than, specialized, power, devices, such, as, the, magnetic, amplifier, and, amplidyne, for, 40, years, power, control, circuitry, used, magnetic, amplifiers, until, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, when, power, semiconductor, devices, became, more, economical, with, higher, operating, speeds, the, old, shreeve, electroacoustic, carbon, repeaters, were, used, in, adjustable, amplifiers, in, telephone, subscriber, sets, for, the, hearing, impaired, until, the, transistor, provided, smaller, and, higher, quality, amplifiers, in, the, 1950s, the, first, working, transistor, was, a, point, contact, transistor, invented, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, brattain, in, 1947, at, bell, labs, where, william, shockley, later, invented, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, bjt, in, 1948, they, were, followed, by, the, invention, of, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, due, to, mosfet, scaling, the, ability, to, scale, down, to, increasingly, small, sizes, the, mosfet, has, since, become, the, most, widely, used, amplifier, the, replacement, of, bulky, electron, tubes, with, transistors, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, created, a, revolution, in, electronics, making, possible, a, large, class, of, portable, electronic, devices, such, as, the, transistor, radio, developed, in, 1954, today, use, of, vacuum, tubes, is, limited, to, some, high, power, applications, such, as, radio, transmitters, as, well, as, some, musical, instrument, and, high, end, audiophile, amplifiers, beginning, in, the, 1970s, more, and, more, transistors, were, connected, on, a, single, chip, thereby, creating, higher, scales, of, integration, such, as, small, scale, medium, scale, and, large, scale, integration, in, integrated, circuits, many, amplifiers, commercially, available, today, are, based, on, integrated, circuits, for, special, purposes, other, active, elements, have, been, used, for, example, in, the, early, days, of, the, satellite, communication, parametric, amplifiers, were, used, the, core, circuit, was, a, diode, whose, capacitance, was, changed, by, an, rf, signal, created, locally, under, certain, conditions, this, rf, signal, provided, energy, that, was, modulated, by, the, extremely, weak, satellite, signal, received, at, the, earth, station, advances, in, digital, electronics, since, the, late, 20th, century, provided, new, alternatives, to, the, conventional, linear, gain, amplifiers, by, using, digital, switching, to, vary, the, pulse, shape, of, fixed, amplitude, signals, resulting, in, devices, such, as, the, class, d, amplifier, in, principle, an, amplifier, is, an, electrical, two, port, network, that, produces, a, signal, at, the, output, port, that, is, a, replica, of, the, signal, applied, to, the, input, port, but, increased, in, magnitude, the, input, port, can, be, idealized, as, either, being, a, voltage, input, which, takes, no, current, with, the, output, proportional, to, the, voltage, across, the, port, or, a, current, input, with, no, voltage, across, it, in, which, the, output, is, proportional, to, the, current, through, the, port, the, output, port, can, be, idealized, as, being, either, a, dependent, voltage, source, with, zero, source, resistance, and, its, output, voltage, dependent, on, the, input, or, a, dependent, current, source, with, infinite, source, resistance, and, the, output, current, dependent, on, the, input, combinations, of, these, choices, lead, to, four, types, of, ideal, amplifiers, in, idealized, form, they, are, represented, by, each, of, the, four, types, of, dependent, source, used, in, linear, analysis, as, shown, in, the, figure, namely, each, type, of, amplifier, in, its, ideal, form, has, an, ideal, input, and, output, resistance, that, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, corresponding, dependent, source, in, real, amplifiers, the, ideal, impedances, are, not, possible, to, achieve, but, these, ideal, elements, can, be, used, to, construct, equivalent, circuits, of, real, amplifiers, by, adding, impedances, resistance, capacitance, and, inductance, to, the, input, and, output, for, any, particular, circuit, a, small, signal, analysis, is, often, used, to, find, the, actual, impedance, a, small, signal, ac, test, current, i, x, is, applied, to, the, input, or, output, node, all, external, sources, are, set, to, ac, zero, and, the, corresponding, alternating, voltage, v, x, across, the, test, current, source, determines, the, impedance, seen, at, that, node, as, r, v, x, i, x, amplifiers, designed, to, attach, to, a, transmission, line, at, input, and, output, especially, rf, amplifiers, do, not, fit, into, this, classification, approach, rather, than, dealing, with, voltage, or, current, individually, they, ideally, couple, with, an, input, or, output, impedance, matched, to, the, transmission, line, impedance, that, is, match, ratios, of, voltage, to, current, many, real, rf, amplifiers, come, close, to, this, ideal, although, for, a, given, appropriate, source, and, load, impedance, rf, amplifiers, can, be, characterized, as, amplifying, voltage, or, current, they, fundamentally, are, amplifying, power, amplifier, properties, are, given, by, parameters, that, include, amplifiers, are, described, according, to, the, properties, of, their, inputs, their, outputs, and, how, they, relate, all, amplifiers, have, gain, a, multiplication, factor, that, relates, the, magnitude, of, some, property, of, the, output, signal, to, a, property, of, the, input, signal, the, gain, may, be, specified, as, the, ratio, of, output, voltage, to, input, voltage, voltage, gain, output, power, to, input, power, power, gain, or, some, combination, of, current, voltage, and, power, in, many, cases, the, property, of, the, output, that, varies, is, dependent, on, the, same, property, of, the, input, making, the, gain, unitless, though, often, expressed, in, decibels, db, most, amplifiers, are, designed, to, be, linear, that, is, they, provide, constant, gain, for, any, normal, input, level, and, output, signal, if, an, amplifier, s, gain, is, not, linear, the, output, signal, can, become, distorted, there, are, however, cases, where, variable, gain, is, useful, certain, signal, processing, applications, use, exponential, gain, amplifiers, amplifiers, are, usually, designed, to, function, well, in, a, specific, application, for, example, radio, and, television, transmitters, and, receivers, high, fidelity, hi, fi, stereo, equipment, microcomputers, and, other, digital, equipment, and, guitar, and, other, instrument, amplifiers, every, amplifier, includes, at, least, one, active, device, such, as, a, vacuum, tube, or, transistor, negative, feedback, is, a, technique, used, in, most, modern, amplifiers, to, increase, bandwidth, reduce, distortion, and, control, gain, in, a, negative, feedback, amplifier, part, of, the, output, is, fed, back, and, added, to, the, input, in, the, opposite, phase, subtracting, from, the, input, the, main, effect, is, to, reduce, the, overall, gain, of, the, system, however, any, unwanted, signals, introduced, by, the, amplifier, such, as, distortion, are, also, fed, back, since, they, are, not, part, of, the, original, input, they, are, added, to, the, input, in, opposite, phase, subtracting, them, from, the, input, in, this, way, negative, feedback, also, reduces, nonlinearity, distortion, and, other, errors, introduced, by, the, amplifier, large, amounts, of, negative, feedback, can, reduce, errors, to, the, point, that, the, response, of, the, amplifier, itself, becomes, almost, irrelevant, as, long, as, it, has, a, large, gain, and, the, output, performance, of, the, system, the, closed, loop, performance, is, defined, entirely, by, the, components, in, the, feedback, loop, this, technique, is, used, particularly, with, operational, amplifiers, op, amps, non, feedback, amplifiers, can, achieve, only, about, 1, distortion, for, audio, frequency, signals, with, negative, feedback, distortion, can, typically, be, reduced, to, 0, 001, noise, even, crossover, distortion, can, be, practically, eliminated, negative, feedback, also, compensates, for, changing, temperatures, and, degrading, or, nonlinear, components, in, the, gain, stage, but, any, change, or, nonlinearity, in, the, components, in, the, feedback, loop, will, affect, the, output, indeed, the, ability, of, the, feedback, loop, to, define, the, output, is, used, to, make, active, filter, circuits, another, advantage, of, negative, feedback, is, that, it, extends, the, bandwidth, of, the, amplifier, the, concept, of, feedback, is, used, in, operational, amplifiers, to, precisely, define, gain, bandwidth, and, other, parameters, entirely, based, on, the, components, in, the, feedback, loop, negative, feedback, can, be, applied, at, each, stage, of, an, amplifier, to, stabilize, the, operating, point, of, active, devices, against, minor, changes, in, power, supply, voltage, or, device, characteristics, some, feedback, positive, or, negative, is, unavoidable, and, often, undesirable, introduced, for, example, by, parasitic, elements, such, as, inherent, capacitance, between, input, and, output, of, devices, such, as, transistors, and, capacitive, coupling, of, external, wiring, excessive, frequency, dependent, positive, feedback, can, produce, parasitic, oscillation, and, turn, an, amplifier, into, an, oscillator, all, amplifiers, include, some, form, of, active, device, this, is, the, device, that, does, the, actual, amplification, the, active, device, can, be, a, vacuum, tube, discrete, solid, state, component, such, as, a, single, transistor, or, part, of, an, integrated, circuit, as, in, an, op, amp, transistor, amplifiers, or, solid, state, amplifiers, are, the, most, common, type, of, amplifier, in, use, today, a, transistor, is, used, as, the, active, element, the, gain, of, the, amplifier, is, determined, by, the, properties, of, the, transistor, itself, as, well, as, the, circuit, it, is, contained, within, common, active, devices, in, transistor, amplifiers, include, bipolar, junction, transistors, bjts, and, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistors, mosfets, applications, are, numerous, some, common, examples, are, audio, amplifiers, in, a, home, stereo, or, public, address, system, rf, high, power, generation, for, semiconductor, equipment, to, rf, and, microwave, applications, such, as, radio, transmitters, transistor, based, amplification, can, be, realized, using, various, configurations, for, example, a, bipolar, junction, transistor, can, realize, common, base, common, collector, or, common, emitter, amplification, a, mosfet, can, realize, common, gate, common, source, or, common, drain, amplification, each, configuration, has, different, characteristics, vacuum, tube, amplifiers, also, known, as, tube, amplifiers, or, valve, amplifiers, use, a, vacuum, tube, as, the, active, device, while, semiconductor, amplifiers, have, largely, displaced, valve, amplifiers, for, low, power, applications, valve, amplifiers, can, be, much, more, cost, effective, in, high, power, applications, such, as, radar, countermeasures, equipment, and, communications, equipment, many, microwave, amplifiers, are, specially, designed, valve, amplifiers, such, as, the, klystron, gyrotron, traveling, wave, tube, and, crossed, field, amplifier, and, these, microwave, valves, provide, much, greater, single, device, power, output, at, microwave, frequencies, than, solid, state, devices, vacuum, tubes, remain, in, use, in, some, high, end, audio, equipment, as, well, as, in, musical, instrument, amplifiers, due, to, a, preference, for, tube, sound, magnetic, amplifiers, are, devices, somewhat, similar, to, a, transformer, where, one, winding, is, used, to, control, the, saturation, of, a, magnetic, core, and, hence, alter, the, impedance, of, the, other, winding, they, have, largely, fallen, out, of, use, due, to, development, in, semiconductor, amplifiers, but, are, still, useful, in, hvdc, control, and, in, nuclear, power, control, circuitry, due, to, not, being, affected, by, radioactivity, negative, resistances, can, be, used, as, amplifiers, such, as, the, tunnel, diode, amplifier, a, power, amplifier, is, an, amplifier, designed, primarily, to, increase, the, power, available, to, a, load, in, practice, amplifier, power, gain, depends, on, the, source, and, load, impedances, as, well, as, the, inherent, voltage, and, current, gain, a, radio, frequency, rf, amplifier, design, typically, optimizes, impedances, for, power, transfer, while, audio, and, instrumentation, amplifier, designs, normally, optimize, input, and, output, impedance, for, least, loading, and, highest, signal, integrity, an, amplifier, that, is, said, to, have, a, gain, of, 20, db, might, have, a, voltage, gain, of, 20, db, and, an, available, power, gain, of, much, more, than, 20, db, power, ratio, of, 100, yet, actually, deliver, a, much, lower, power, gain, if, for, example, the, input, is, from, a, 600, microphone, and, the, output, connects, to, a, 47, k, input, socket, for, a, power, amplifier, in, general, the, power, amplifier, is, the, last, amplifier, or, actual, circuit, in, a, signal, chain, the, output, stage, and, is, the, amplifier, stage, that, requires, attention, to, power, efficiency, efficiency, considerations, lead, to, the, various, classes, of, power, amplifiers, based, on, the, biasing, of, the, output, transistors, or, tubes, see, power, amplifier, classes, below, audio, power, amplifiers, are, typically, used, to, drive, loudspeakers, they, will, often, have, two, output, channels, and, deliver, equal, power, to, each, an, rf, power, amplifier, is, found, in, radio, transmitter, final, stages, a, servo, motor, controller, amplifies, a, control, voltage, to, adjust, the, speed, of, a, motor, or, the, position, of, a, motorized, system, an, operational, amplifier, is, an, amplifier, circuit, which, typically, has, very, high, open, loop, gain, and, differential, inputs, op, amps, have, become, very, widely, used, as, standardized, gain, blocks, in, circuits, due, to, their, versatility, their, gain, bandwidth, and, other, characteristics, can, be, controlled, by, feedback, through, an, external, circuit, though, the, term, today, commonly, applies, to, integrated, circuits, the, original, operational, amplifier, design, used, valves, and, later, designs, used, discrete, transistor, circuits, a, fully, differential, amplifier, is, similar, to, the, operational, amplifier, but, also, has, differential, outputs, these, are, usually, constructed, using, bjts, or, fets, these, use, balanced, transmission, lines, to, separate, individual, single, stage, amplifiers, the, outputs, of, which, are, summed, by, the, same, transmission, line, the, transmission, line, is, a, balanced, type, with, the, input, at, one, end, and, on, one, side, only, of, the, balanced, transmission, line, and, the, output, at, the, opposite, end, is, also, the, opposite, side, of, the, balanced, transmission, line, the, gain, of, each, stage, adds, linearly, to, the, output, rather, than, multiplies, one, on, the, other, as, in, a, cascade, configuration, this, allows, a, higher, bandwidth, to, be, achieved, than, could, otherwise, be, realised, even, with, the, same, gain, stage, elements, these, nonlinear, amplifiers, have, much, higher, efficiencies, than, linear, amps, and, are, used, where, the, power, saving, justifies, the, extra, complexity, class, d, amplifiers, are, the, main, example, of, this, type, of, amplification, negative, resistance, amplifier, is, a, type, of, regenerative, amplifier, that, can, use, the, feedback, between, the, transistor, s, source, and, gate, to, transform, a, capacitive, impedance, on, the, transistor, s, source, to, a, negative, resistance, on, its, gate, compared, to, other, types, of, amplifiers, this, negative, resistance, amplifier, will, require, only, a, tiny, amount, of, power, to, achieve, very, high, gain, maintaining, a, good, noise, figure, at, the, same, time, video, amplifiers, are, designed, to, process, video, signals, and, have, varying, bandwidths, depending, on, whether, the, video, signal, is, for, sdtv, edtv, hdtv, 720p, or, 1080i, p, etc, the, specification, of, the, bandwidth, itself, depends, on, what, kind, of, filter, is, used, and, at, which, point, 1, db, or, 3, db, for, example, the, bandwidth, is, measured, certain, requirements, for, step, response, and, overshoot, are, necessary, for, an, acceptable, tv, image, traveling, wave, tube, amplifiers, twtas, are, used, for, high, power, amplification, at, low, microwave, frequencies, they, typically, can, amplify, across, a, broad, spectrum, of, frequencies, however, they, are, usually, not, as, tunable, as, klystrons, klystrons, are, specialized, linear, beam, vacuum, devices, designed, to, provide, high, power, widely, tunable, amplification, of, millimetre, and, sub, millimetre, waves, klystrons, are, designed, for, large, scale, operations, and, despite, having, a, narrower, bandwidth, than, twtas, they, have, the, advantage, of, coherently, amplifying, a, reference, signal, so, its, output, may, be, precisely, controlled, in, amplitude, frequency, and, phase, solid, state, devices, such, as, silicon, short, channel, mosfets, like, double, diffused, metal, oxide, semiconductor, dmos, fets, gaas, fets, sige, and, gaas, heterojunction, bipolar, transistors, hbts, hemts, impatt, diodes, and, others, are, used, especially, at, lower, microwave, frequencies, and, power, levels, on, the, order, of, watts, specifically, in, applications, like, portable, rf, terminals, cell, phones, and, access, points, where, size, and, efficiency, are, the, drivers, new, materials, like, gallium, nitride, gan, or, gan, on, silicon, or, on, silicon, carbide, sic, are, emerging, in, hemt, transistors, and, applications, where, improved, efficiency, wide, bandwidth, operation, roughly, from, few, to, few, tens, of, ghz, with, output, power, of, few, watts, to, few, hundred, of, watts, are, needed, depending, on, the, amplifier, specifications, and, size, requirements, microwave, amplifiers, can, be, realised, as, monolithically, integrated, integrated, as, modules, or, based, on, discrete, parts, or, any, combination, of, those, the, maser, is, a, non, electronic, microwave, amplifier, instrument, amplifiers, are, a, range, of, audio, power, amplifiers, used, to, increase, the, sound, level, of, musical, instruments, for, example, guitars, during, performances, amplifiers, tone, mainly, come, from, the, order, and, amount, in, which, it, applies, eq, and, distortion, one, set, of, classifications, for, amplifiers, is, based, on, which, device, terminal, is, common, to, both, the, input, and, the, output, circuit, in, the, case, of, bipolar, junction, transistors, the, three, classes, are, common, emitter, common, base, and, common, collector, for, field, effect, transistors, the, corresponding, configurations, are, common, source, common, gate, and, common, drain, for, vacuum, tubes, common, cathode, common, grid, and, common, plate, the, common, emitter, or, common, source, common, cathode, etc, is, most, often, configured, to, provide, amplification, of, a, voltage, applied, between, base, and, emitter, and, the, output, signal, taken, between, collector, and, emitter, is, inverted, relative, to, the, input, the, common, collector, arrangement, applies, the, input, voltage, between, base, and, collector, and, to, take, the, output, voltage, between, emitter, and, collector, this, causes, negative, feedback, and, the, output, voltage, tends, to, follow, the, input, voltage, this, arrangement, is, also, used, as, the, input, presents, a, high, impedance, and, does, not, load, the, signal, source, though, the, voltage, amplification, is, less, than, one, the, common, collector, circuit, is, therefore, better, known, as, an, emitter, follower, source, follower, or, cathode, follower, an, amplifier, whose, output, exhibits, no, feedback, to, its, input, side, is, described, as, unilateral, the, input, impedance, of, a, unilateral, amplifier, is, independent, of, load, and, output, impedance, is, independent, of, signal, source, impedance, an, amplifier, that, uses, feedback, to, connect, part, of, the, output, back, to, the, input, is, a, bilateral, amplifier, bilateral, amplifier, input, impedance, depends, on, the, load, and, output, impedance, on, the, signal, source, impedance, all, amplifiers, are, bilateral, to, some, degree, however, they, may, often, be, modeled, as, unilateral, under, operating, conditions, where, feedback, is, small, enough, to, neglect, for, most, purposes, simplifying, analysis, see, the, common, base, article, for, an, example, another, way, to, classify, amplifiers, is, by, the, phase, relationship, of, the, input, signal, to, the, output, signal, an, inverting, amplifier, produces, an, output, 180, degrees, out, of, phase, with, the, input, signal, that, is, a, polarity, inversion, or, mirror, image, of, the, input, as, seen, on, an, oscilloscope, a, non, inverting, amplifier, maintains, the, phase, of, the, input, signal, waveforms, an, emitter, follower, is, a, type, of, non, inverting, amplifier, indicating, that, the, signal, at, the, emitter, of, a, transistor, is, following, that, is, matching, with, unity, gain, but, perhaps, an, offset, the, input, signal, voltage, follower, is, also, non, inverting, type, of, amplifier, having, unity, gain, this, description, can, apply, to, a, single, stage, of, an, amplifier, or, to, a, complete, amplifier, system, other, amplifiers, may, be, classified, by, their, function, or, output, characteristics, these, functional, descriptions, usually, apply, to, complete, amplifier, systems, or, sub, systems, and, rarely, to, individual, stages, amplifiers, are, sometimes, classified, by, the, coupling, method, of, the, signal, at, the, input, output, or, between, stages, different, types, of, these, include, depending, on, the, frequency, range, and, other, properties, amplifiers, are, designed, according, to, different, principles, frequency, ranges, down, to, dc, are, used, only, when, this, property, is, needed, amplifiers, for, direct, current, signals, are, vulnerable, to, minor, variations, in, the, properties, of, components, with, time, special, methods, such, as, chopper, stabilized, amplifiers, are, used, to, prevent, objectionable, drift, in, the, amplifier, s, properties, for, dc, dc, blocking, capacitors, can, be, added, to, remove, dc, and, sub, sonic, frequencies, from, audio, amplifiers, depending, on, the, frequency, range, specified, different, design, principles, must, be, used, up, to, the, mhz, range, only, discrete, properties, need, be, considered, e, g, a, terminal, has, an, input, impedance, as, soon, as, any, connection, within, the, circuit, gets, longer, than, perhaps, 1, of, the, wavelength, of, the, highest, specified, frequency, e, g, at, 100, mhz, the, wavelength, is, 3, m, so, the, critical, connection, length, is, approx, 3, cm, design, properties, radically, change, for, example, a, specified, length, and, width, of, a, pcb, trace, can, be, used, as, a, selective, or, impedance, matching, entity, above, a, few, hundred, mhz, it, gets, difficult, to, use, discrete, elements, especially, inductors, in, most, cases, pcb, traces, of, very, closely, defined, shapes, are, used, instead, stripline, techniques, the, frequency, range, handled, by, an, amplifier, might, be, specified, in, terms, of, bandwidth, normally, implying, a, response, that, is, 3, db, down, when, the, frequency, reaches, the, specified, bandwidth, or, by, specifying, a, frequency, response, that, is, within, a, certain, number, of, decibels, between, a, lower, and, an, upper, frequency, e, g, 20, hz, to, 20, khz, plus, or, minus, 1, db, power, amplifier, circuits, output, stages, are, classified, as, a, b, ab, and, c, for, analog, designs, and, class, d, and, e, for, switching, designs, the, power, amplifier, classes, are, based, on, the, proportion, of, each, input, cycle, conduction, angle, during, which, an, amplifying, device, passes, current, the, image, of, the, conduction, angle, derives, from, amplifying, a, sinusoidal, signal, if, the, device, is, always, on, the, conducting, angle, is, 360, if, it, is, on, for, only, half, of, each, cycle, the, angle, is, 180, the, angle, of, flow, is, closely, related, to, the, amplifier, power, efficiency, the, practical, amplifier, circuit, shown, above, could, be, the, basis, for, a, moderate, power, audio, amplifier, it, features, a, typical, though, substantially, simplified, design, as, found, in, modern, amplifiers, with, a, class, ab, push, pull, output, stage, and, uses, some, overall, negative, feedback, bipolar, transistors, are, shown, but, this, design, would, also, be, realizable, with, fets, or, valves, the, input, signal, is, coupled, through, capacitor, c1, to, the, base, of, transistor, q1, the, capacitor, allows, the, ac, signal, to, pass, but, blocks, the, dc, bias, voltage, established, by, resistors, r1, and, r2, so, that, any, preceding, circuit, is, not, affected, by, it, q1, and, q2, form, a, differential, amplifier, an, amplifier, that, multiplies, the, difference, between, two, inputs, by, some, constant, in, an, arrangement, known, as, a, long, tailed, pair, this, arrangement, is, used, to, conveniently, allow, the, use, of, negative, feedback, which, is, fed, from, the, output, to, q2, via, r7, and, r8, the, negative, feedback, into, the, difference, amplifier, allows, the, amplifier, to, compare, the, input, to, the, actual, output, the, amplified, signal, from, q1, is, directly, fed, to, the, second, stage, q3, which, is, a, common, emitter, stage, that, provides, further, amplification, of, the, signal, and, the, dc, bias, for, the, output, stages, q4, and, q5, r6, provides, the, load, for, q3, a, better, design, would, probably, use, some, form, of, active, load, here, such, as, a, constant, current, sink, so, far, all, of, the, amplifier, is, operating, in, class, a, the, output, pair, are, arranged, in, class, ab, push, pull, also, called, a, complementary, pair, they, provide, the, majority, of, the, current, amplification, while, consuming, low, quiescent, current, and, directly, drive, the, load, connected, via, dc, blocking, capacitor, c2, the, diodes, d1, and, d2, provide, a, small, amount, of, constant, voltage, bias, for, the, output, pair, just, biasing, them, into, the, conducting, state, so, that, crossover, distortion, is, minimized, that, is, the, diodes, push, the, output, stage, firmly, into, class, ab, mode, assuming, that, the, base, emitter, drop, of, the, output, transistors, is, reduced, by, heat, dissipation, this, design, is, simple, but, a, good, basis, for, a, practical, design, because, it, automatically, stabilises, its, operating, point, since, feedback, internally, operates, from, dc, up, through, the, audio, range, and, beyond, further, circuit, elements, would, probably, be, found, in, a, real, design, that, would, roll, off, the, frequency, response, above, the, needed, range, to, prevent, the, possibility, of, unwanted, oscillation, also, the, use, of, fixed, diode, bias, as, shown, here, can, cause, problems, if, the, diodes, are, not, both, electrically, and, thermally, matched, to, the, output, transistors, if, the, output, transistors, turn, on, too, much, they, can, easily, overheat, and, destroy, themselves, as, the, full, current, from, the, power, supply, is, not, limited, at, this, stage, a, common, solution, to, help, stabilise, the, output, devices, is, to, include, some, emitter, resistors, typically, one, ohm, or, so, calculating, the, values, of, the, circuit, s, resistors, and, capacitors, is, done, based, on, the, components, employed, and, the, intended, use, of, the, amp, any, real, amplifier, is, an, imperfect, realization, of, an, ideal, amplifier, an, important, limitation, of, a, real, amplifier, is, that, the, output, it, generates, is, ultimately, limited, by, the, power, available, from, the, power, supply, an, amplifier, saturates, and, clips, the, output, if, the, input, signal, becomes, too, large, for, the, amplifier, to, reproduce, or, exceeds, operational, limits, for, the, device, the, power, supply, may, influence, the, output, so, must, be, considered, in, the, design, the, power, output, from, an, amplifier, cannot, exceed, its, input, power, the, amplifier, circuit, has, an, open, loop, performance, this, is, described, by, various, parameters, gain, slew, rate, output, impedance, distortion, bandwidth, signal, to, noise, ratio, etc, many, modern, amplifiers, use, negative, feedback, techniques, to, hold, the, gain, at, the, desired, value, and, reduce, distortion, negative, loop, feedback, has, the, intended, effect, of, lowering, the, output, impedance, and, thereby, increasing, electrical, damping, of, loudspeaker, motion, at, and, near, the, resonance, frequency, of, the, speaker, when, assessing, rated, amplifier, power, output, it, is, useful, to, consider, the, applied, load, the, signal, type, e, g, speech, or, music, required, power, output, duration, i, e, short, time, or, continuous, and, required, dynamic, range, e, g, recorded, or, live, audio, in, high, powered, audio, applications, that, require, long, cables, to, the, load, e, g, cinemas, and, shopping, centres, it, may, be, more, efficient, to, connect, to, the, load, at, line, output, voltage, with, matching, transformers, at, source, and, loads, this, avoids, long, runs, of, heavy, speaker, cables, to, prevent, instability, or, overheating, requires, care, to, ensure, solid, state, amplifiers, are, adequately, loaded, most, have, a, rated, minimum, load, impedance, all, amplifiers, generate, heat, through, electrical, losses, the, amplifier, must, dissipate, this, heat, via, convection, or, forced, air, cooling, heat, can, damage, or, reduce, electronic, component, service, life, designers, and, installers, must, also, consider, heating, effects, on, adjacent, equipment, different, power, supply, types, result, in, many, different, methods, of, bias, bias, is, a, technique, by, which, active, devices, are, set, to, operate, in, a, particular, region, or, by, which, the, dc, component, of, the, output, signal, is, set, to, the, midpoint, between, the, maximum, voltages, available, from, the, power, supply, most, amplifiers, use, several, devices, at, each, stage, they, are, typically, matched, in, specifications, except, for, polarity, matched, inverted, polarity, devices, are, called, complementary, pairs, class, a, amplifiers, generally, use, only, one, device, unless, the, power, supply, is, set, to, provide, both, positive, and, negative, voltages, in, which, case, a, dual, device, symmetrical, design, may, be, used, class, c, amplifiers, by, definition, use, a, single, polarity, supply, amplifiers, often, have, multiple, stages, in, cascade, to, increase, gain, each, stage, of, these, designs, may, be, a, different, type, of, amp, to, suit, the, needs, of, that, stage, for, instance, the, first, stage, might, be, a, class, a, stage, feeding, a, class, ab, push, pull, second, stage, which, then, drives, a, class, g, final, output, stage, taking, advantage, of, the, strengths, of, each, type, while, minimizing, their, weaknesses
