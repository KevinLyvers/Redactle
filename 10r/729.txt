virtually, all, riverboats, are, especially, designed, and, constructed, or, alternatively, constructed, with, special, purpose, features, that, optimize, them, as, riverine, or, lake, service, craft, for, instance, dredgers, survey, boats, fisheries, management, craft, fireboats, and, law, enforcement, patrol, craft, riverboats, are, usually, less, sturdy, than, ships, built, for, the, open, seas, with, limited, navigational, and, rescue, equipment, as, they, do, not, have, to, withstand, the, high, winds, or, large, waves, characteristic, to, large, lakes, seas, or, oceans, they, can, thus, be, built, from, light, composite, materials, they, are, limited, in, size, by, width, and, depth, of, the, river, as, well, as, the, height, of, bridges, spanning, the, river, they, can, be, designed, with, shallow, drafts, as, were, the, paddle, wheel, steamers, on, the, mississippi, river, that, could, operate, in, water, under, two, metres, deep, while, a, ferry, is, often, used, to, cross, a, river, a, riverboat, is, used, to, travel, along, the, course, of, the, river, while, carrying, passengers, or, cargo, or, both, for, revenue, vessels, like, riverboat, casinos, are, not, considered, here, as, they, are, essentially, stationary, the, significance, of, riverboats, is, dependent, on, the, number, of, navigable, rivers, and, channels, as, well, as, the, condition, of, the, road, and, rail, network, generally, speaking, riverboats, provide, slow, but, cheap, transport, especially, suited, for, bulk, cargo, and, containers, as, early, as, 20, 000, bc, people, started, fishing, in, rivers, and, lakes, using, rafts, and, dugouts, roman, sources, dated, 50, bc, mention, extensive, transportation, of, goods, and, people, on, the, river, rhine, upstream, boats, were, usually, powered, by, sails, or, oars, in, the, middle, ages, towpaths, were, built, along, most, waterways, to, use, working, animals, or, people, to, pull, riverboats, in, the, 19th, century, steamboats, became, common, the, most, famous, riverboats, were, on, the, rivers, of, the, midwestern, and, central, southern, united, states, on, the, mississippi, ohio, and, missouri, rivers, in, the, early, 19th, century, out, west, riverboats, were, common, transportation, on, the, colorado, columbia, and, sacramento, rivers, these, american, riverboats, were, designed, to, draw, very, little, water, and, in, fact, it, was, commonly, said, that, they, could, navigate, on, a, heavy, dew, australia, has, a, history, of, riverboats, australia, s, biggest, river, the, murray, has, an, inland, port, called, echuca, many, large, riverboats, were, working, on, the, murray, but, now, a, lower, water, level, is, stopping, them, the, kalgan, river, in, western, australia, has, had, two, main, riverboats, the, silver, star, 1918, to, 1935, would, lower, her, funnel, to, get, under, the, low, bridge, today, the, kalgan, queen, riverboat, takes, tourists, up, the, river, to, taste, the, local, wines, she, lowers, her, roof, to, get, under, the, same, bridge, it, is, these, early, steam, driven, river, craft, that, typically, come, to, mind, when, steamboat, is, mentioned, as, these, were, powered, by, burning, wood, with, iron, boilers, drafted, by, a, pair, of, tall, smokestacks, belching, smoke, and, cinders, and, twin, double, acting, pistons, driving, a, large, paddlewheel, at, the, stern, churning, foam, this, type, of, propulsion, was, an, advantage, as, a, rear, paddlewheel, operates, in, an, area, clear, of, snags, is, easily, repaired, and, is, not, likely, to, suffer, damage, in, a, grounding, by, burning, wood, the, boat, could, consume, fuel, provided, by, woodcutters, along, the, shore, of, the, river, these, early, boats, carried, a, brow, a, short, bridge, on, the, bow, so, they, could, head, in, to, an, unimproved, shore, for, transfer, of, cargo, and, passengers, modern, riverboats, are, generally, screw, propeller, driven, with, pairs, of, diesel, engines, of, several, thousand, horsepower, the, standard, reference, for, the, development, of, the, steamboat, is, steamboats, on, western, rivers, an, economic, and, technological, history, by, louis, c, hunter, 1949, terrace, british, columbia, canada, celebrates, riverboat, days, each, summer, the, skeena, river, passes, through, terrace, and, played, a, crucial, role, during, the, age, of, the, steamboat, the, first, steam, powered, vessel, to, enter, the, skeena, was, the, union, in, 1864, in, 1866, the, mumford, attempted, to, ascend, the, river, but, was, only, able, to, reach, the, kitsumkalum, river, it, was, not, until, 1891, that, the, hudson, s, bay, company, sternwheeler, the, caledonia, successfully, negotiated, through, the, kitselas, canyon, and, reached, hazelton, a, number, of, other, steamers, were, built, around, the, turn, of, the, century, in, part, due, to, the, growing, fish, industry, and, the, gold, rush, the, wt, preston, a, museum, ship, that, was, once, a, specialised, river, dredge, also, called, a, snagboat, some, large, riverboats, are, comparable, in, accommodation, food, service, and, entertainment, to, a, modern, oceanic, cruise, ship, tourist, boats, provide, a, scenic, and, relaxing, trip, through, the, segment, they, operate, in, on, the, yangtze, river, typically, employees, have, double, duties, both, as, serving, staff, and, as, evening, costumed, dancers, smaller, luxury, craft, without, entertainment, operate, on, european, waterways, both, rivers, and, canals, with, some, providing, bicycle, and, van, side, trips, to, smaller, villages, high, speed, boats, such, as, those, shown, here, had, a, special, advantage, in, some, operations, in, the, free, running, yangtze, in, several, locations, within, the, three, gorges, one, way, travel, was, enforced, through, fast, narrows, while, less, maneuverable, and, deeper, draft, vessels, were, obliged, to, wait, for, clearance, these, high, speed, boats, were, free, to, zip, past, waiting, traffic, by, running, in, the, shallows, smaller, riverboats, are, used, in, urban, and, suburban, areas, for, sightseeing, and, public, transport, sightseeing, boats, can, be, found, in, amsterdam, paris, and, other, touristic, cities, where, historical, monuments, are, located, near, water, the, concept, of, local, waterborn, public, transport, is, known, as, water, taxi, in, english, speaking, countries, vaporetto, in, venice, water, river, tramway, in, former, soviet, union, and, poland, although, sightseeing, boats, can, be, called, water, tramways, too, local, waterborne, public, transport, is, similar, to, ferry, the, transport, craft, shown, below, is, used, for, short, distance, carriage, of, passengers, between, villages, and, small, cities, along, the, yangtze, while, larger, craft, are, used, for, low, cost, carriage, over, longer, distance, without, the, fancy, food, or, shows, seen, on, the, tourist, riverboats, in, some, cases, the, traveller, must, provide, their, own, food, as, the, major, rivers, in, china, are, mostly, east, west, most, rail, and, road, transport, are, typically, north, south, as, roads, along, the, rivers, are, inadequate, for, heavy, truck, transport, and, in, some, cases, extremely, dangerous, drive, on, drive, off, ramp, barges, are, used, to, transport, trucks, in, many, cases, the, trucks, transported, are, new, and, are, being, delivered, to, customers, or, dealers, perhaps, unique, to, china, the, new, trucks, observed, traveling, upstream, were, all, blue, while, the, new, trucks, traveling, downstream, were, all, white, low, value, goods, are, transported, on, rivers, and, canals, worldwide, since, slow, speed, barge, traffic, offers, the, lowest, possible, cost, per, ton, mile, and, the, capital, cost, per, ton, carried, is, also, quite, low, compared, to, other, modes, of, transport
