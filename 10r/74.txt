ms, dos, m, s, d, s, em, es, doss, acronym, for, microsoft, disk, operating, system, also, known, as, microsoft, dos, is, an, operating, system, for, x86, based, personal, computers, mostly, developed, by, microsoft, collectively, ms, dos, its, rebranding, as, ibm, pc, dos, and, a, few, operating, systems, attempting, to, be, compatible, with, ms, dos, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, dos, which, is, also, the, generic, acronym, for, disk, operating, system, ms, dos, was, the, main, operating, system, for, ibm, pc, compatibles, during, the, 1980s, from, which, point, it, was, gradually, superseded, by, operating, systems, offering, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, in, various, generations, of, the, graphical, microsoft, windows, operating, system, ibm, licensed, and, re, released, it, in, 1981, as, pc, dos, 1, 0, for, use, in, its, pcs, although, ms, dos, and, pc, dos, were, initially, developed, in, parallel, by, microsoft, and, ibm, the, two, products, diverged, after, twelve, years, in, 1993, with, recognizable, differences, in, compatibility, syntax, and, capabilities, beginning, in, 1988, with, dr, dos, several, competing, products, were, released, for, the, x86, platform, and, ms, dos, went, through, eight, versions, until, development, ceased, in, 2000, initially, ms, dos, was, targeted, at, intel, 8086, processors, running, on, computer, hardware, using, floppy, disks, to, store, and, access, not, only, the, operating, system, but, application, software, and, user, data, as, well, progressive, version, releases, delivered, support, for, other, mass, storage, media, in, ever, greater, sizes, and, formats, along, with, added, feature, support, for, newer, processors, and, rapidly, evolving, computer, architectures, ultimately, it, was, the, key, product, in, microsoft, s, development, from, a, programming, language, company, to, a, diverse, software, development, firm, providing, the, company, with, essential, revenue, and, marketing, resources, it, was, also, the, underlying, basic, operating, system, on, which, early, versions, of, windows, ran, as, a, gui, ms, dos, was, a, renamed, form, of, 86, dos, owned, by, seattle, computer, products, written, by, tim, paterson, development, of, 86, dos, took, only, six, weeks, as, it, was, basically, a, clone, of, digital, research, s, cp, m, for, 8080, z80, processors, ported, to, run, on, 8086, processors, and, with, two, notable, differences, compared, to, cp, m, an, improved, disk, sector, buffering, logic, and, the, introduction, of, fat12, instead, of, the, cp, m, filesystem, this, first, version, was, shipped, in, august, 1980, microsoft, which, needed, an, operating, system, for, the, ibm, personal, computer, hired, tim, paterson, in, may, 1981, and, bought, 86, dos, 1, 10, for, us, 25, 000, in, july, of, the, same, year, microsoft, kept, the, version, number, but, renamed, it, ms, dos, they, also, licensed, ms, dos, 1, 10, 1, 14, to, ibm, which, in, august, 1981, offered, it, as, pc, dos, 1, 0, as, one, of, three, operating, systems, for, the, ibm, 5150, or, the, ibm, pc, within, a, year, microsoft, licensed, ms, dos, to, over, 70, other, companies, it, was, designed, to, be, an, os, that, could, run, on, any, 8086, family, computer, each, computer, would, have, its, own, distinct, hardware, and, its, own, version, of, ms, dos, similar, to, the, situation, that, existed, for, cp, m, and, with, ms, dos, emulating, the, same, solution, as, cp, m, to, adapt, for, different, hardware, platforms, to, this, end, ms, dos, was, designed, with, a, modular, structure, with, internal, device, drivers, the, dos, bios, minimally, for, primary, disk, drives, and, the, console, integrated, with, the, kernel, and, loaded, by, the, boot, loader, and, installable, device, drivers, for, other, devices, loaded, and, integrated, at, boot, time, the, oem, would, use, a, development, kit, provided, by, microsoft, to, build, a, version, of, ms, dos, with, their, basic, i, o, drivers, and, a, standard, microsoft, kernel, which, they, would, typically, supply, on, disk, to, end, users, along, with, the, hardware, thus, there, were, many, different, versions, of, ms, dos, for, different, hardware, and, there, is, a, major, distinction, between, an, ibm, compatible, or, isa, machine, and, an, ms, dos, machine, some, machines, like, the, tandy, 2000, were, ms, dos, compatible, but, not, ibm, compatible, so, they, could, run, software, written, exclusively, for, ms, dos, without, dependence, on, the, peripheral, hardware, of, the, ibm, pc, architecture, this, design, would, have, worked, well, for, compatibility, if, application, programs, had, only, used, ms, dos, services, to, perform, device, i, o, and, indeed, the, same, design, philosophy, is, embodied, in, windows, nt, see, hardware, abstraction, layer, however, in, ms, dos, s, early, days, the, greater, speed, attainable, by, programs, through, direct, control, of, hardware, was, of, particular, importance, especially, for, games, which, often, pushed, the, limits, of, their, contemporary, hardware, very, soon, an, ibm, compatible, architecture, became, the, goal, and, before, long, all, 8086, family, computers, closely, emulated, ibm, s, hardware, and, only, a, single, version, of, ms, dos, for, a, fixed, hardware, platform, was, needed, for, the, market, this, version, is, the, version, of, ms, dos, that, is, discussed, here, as, the, dozens, of, other, oem, versions, of, ms, dos, were, only, relevant, to, the, systems, they, were, designed, for, and, in, any, case, were, very, similar, in, function, and, capability, to, some, standard, version, for, the, ibm, pc, often, the, same, numbered, version, but, not, always, since, some, oems, used, their, own, proprietary, version, numbering, schemes, e, g, labeling, later, releases, of, ms, dos, 1, x, as, 2, 0, or, vice, versa, with, a, few, notable, exceptions, microsoft, omitted, multi, user, support, from, ms, dos, because, microsoft, s, unix, based, operating, system, xenix, was, fully, multi, user, the, company, planned, over, time, to, improve, ms, dos, so, it, would, be, almost, indistinguishable, from, single, user, xenix, or, xedos, which, would, also, run, on, the, motorola, 68000, zilog, z8000, and, the, lsi, 11, they, would, be, upwardly, compatible, with, xenix, which, byte, in, 1983, described, as, the, multi, user, ms, dos, of, the, future, microsoft, advertised, ms, dos, and, xenix, together, listing, the, shared, features, of, its, single, user, os, and, the, multi, user, multi, tasking, unix, derived, operating, system, and, promising, easy, porting, between, them, after, the, breakup, of, the, bell, system, however, at, t, computer, systems, started, selling, unix, system, v, believing, that, it, could, not, compete, with, at, t, in, the, unix, market, microsoft, abandoned, xenix, and, in, 1987, transferred, ownership, of, xenix, to, the, santa, cruz, operation, sco, on, march, 25, 2014, microsoft, made, the, code, to, scp, ms, dos, 1, 25, and, a, mixture, of, altos, ms, dos, 2, 11, and, televideo, pc, dos, 2, 11, available, to, the, public, under, the, microsoft, research, license, agreement, which, makes, the, code, source, available, but, not, open, source, as, defined, by, open, source, initiative, or, free, software, foundation, standards, microsoft, would, later, re, license, the, code, under, the, mit, license, on, september, 28, 2018, making, these, versions, free, software, microsoft, later, released, the, code, for, ms, dos, 4, 00, on, april, 25, 2024, as, an, april, fool, s, day, joke, in, 2015, microsoft, mobile, launched, a, windows, phone, application, called, ms, dos, mobile, which, was, presented, as, a, new, mobile, operating, system, and, worked, similar, to, ms, dos, microsoft, licensed, or, released, versions, of, ms, dos, under, different, names, like, lifeboat, associates, software, bus, 86, a, k, a, sb, dos, compaq, dos, ncr, dos, or, z, dos, before, it, eventually, enforced, the, ms, dos, name, for, all, versions, but, the, ibm, one, which, was, originally, called, ibm, personal, computer, dos, later, shortened, to, ibm, pc, dos, competitors, released, compatible, dos, systems, such, as, dr, dos, and, pts, dos, that, could, also, run, ms, dos, applications, in, the, former, eastern, bloc, ms, dos, derivatives, named, dcp, disk, control, program, 3, 20, and, 3, 30, dcp, 1700, dcp, 3, 3, and, wdos, existed, in, the, late, 1980s, they, were, produced, by, the, east, german, electronics, manufacturer, veb, robotron, the, following, versions, of, ms, dos, were, released, to, the, public, support, for, ibm, s, xt, 10, mb, hard, disk, drives, support, up, to, 16, mb, or, 32, mb, fat12, formatted, hard, disk, drives, depending, on, the, formatting, tool, shipped, by, oems, user, installable, device, drivers, tree, structure, filing, system, unix, like, inheritable, redirectable, file, handles, non, multitasking, child, processes, an, improved, terminate, and, stay, resident, tsr, api, environment, variables, device, driver, support, for, and, goto, loops, in, batch, files, ansi, sys, microsoft, dos, was, released, through, the, oem, channel, until, digital, research, released, dr, dos, 5, 0, as, a, retail, upgrade, with, pc, dos, 5, 00, 1, the, ibm, microsoft, agreement, started, to, end, and, ibm, entered, the, retail, dos, market, with, ibm, dos, 5, 00, 1, 5, 02, 6, 00, and, pc, dos, 6, 1, 6, 3, 7, 2000, and, 7, 1, localized, versions, of, ms, dos, existed, for, different, markets, while, western, issues, of, ms, dos, evolved, around, the, same, set, of, tools, and, drivers, just, with, localized, message, languages, and, differing, sets, of, supported, codepages, and, keyboard, layouts, some, language, versions, were, considerably, different, from, western, issues, and, were, adapted, to, run, on, localized, pc, hardware, with, additional, bios, services, not, available, in, western, pcs, support, multiple, hardware, codepages, for, displays, and, printers, support, dbcs, alternative, input, methods, and, graphics, output, affected, issues, include, japanese, dos, v, korean, arabic, ados, 3, 3, 5, 0, hebrew, hdos, 3, 3, 5, 0, russian, rdos, 4, 01, 5, 0, as, well, as, some, other, eastern, european, versions, of, dos, on, microcomputers, based, on, the, intel, 8086, and, 8088, processors, including, the, ibm, pc, and, clones, the, initial, competition, to, the, pc, dos, ms, dos, line, came, from, digital, research, whose, cp, m, operating, system, had, inspired, ms, dos, in, fact, there, remains, controversy, as, to, whether, qdos, was, more, or, less, plagiarized, from, early, versions, of, cp, m, code, digital, research, released, cp, m, 86, a, few, months, after, ms, dos, and, it, was, offered, as, an, alternative, to, ms, dos, and, microsoft, s, licensing, requirements, but, at, a, higher, price, executable, programs, for, cp, m, 86, and, ms, dos, were, not, interchangeable, with, each, other, many, applications, were, sold, in, both, ms, dos, and, cp, m, 86, versions, until, ms, dos, became, preponderant, later, digital, research, operating, systems, could, run, both, ms, dos, and, cp, m, 86, software, ms, dos, originally, supported, the, simple, com, which, was, modeled, after, a, similar, but, binary, incompatible, format, known, from, cp, m, 80, cp, m, 86, instead, supported, a, relocatable, format, using, the, filename, extension, cmd, to, avoid, name, conflicts, with, cp, m, 80, and, ms, dos, com, files, ms, dos, version, 1, 0, added, a, more, advanced, relocatable, exe, executable, file, format, most, of, the, machines, in, the, early, days, of, ms, dos, had, differing, system, architectures, and, there, was, a, certain, degree, of, incompatibility, and, subsequently, vendor, lock, in, users, who, began, using, ms, dos, with, their, machines, were, compelled, to, continue, using, the, version, customized, for, their, hardware, or, face, trying, to, get, all, of, their, proprietary, hardware, and, software, to, work, with, the, new, system, in, the, business, world, the, 808x, based, machines, that, ms, dos, was, tied, to, faced, competition, from, the, unix, operating, system, the, latter, ran, on, many, different, hardware, architectures, microsoft, itself, sold, a, version, of, unix, for, the, pc, called, xenix, in, the, emerging, world, of, home, users, a, variety, of, other, computers, based, on, various, other, processors, were, in, serious, competition, with, the, ibm, pc, the, apple, ii, early, apple, macintosh, the, commodore, 64, and, others, did, not, use, the, 808x, processor, many, 808x, machines, of, different, architectures, used, custom, versions, of, ms, dos, at, first, all, these, machines, were, in, competition, in, time, the, ibm, pc, hardware, configuration, became, dominant, in, the, 808x, market, as, software, written, to, communicate, directly, with, the, pc, hardware, without, using, standard, operating, system, calls, ran, much, faster, but, on, true, pc, compatibles, only, non, pc, compatible, 808x, machines, were, too, small, a, market, to, have, fast, software, written, for, them, alone, and, the, market, remained, open, only, for, ibm, pcs, and, machines, that, closely, imitated, their, architecture, all, running, either, a, single, version, of, ms, dos, compatible, only, with, pcs, or, the, equivalent, ibm, pc, dos, most, clones, cost, much, less, than, ibm, branded, machines, of, similar, performance, and, became, widely, used, by, home, users, while, ibm, pcs, had, a, large, share, of, the, business, computer, market, microsoft, and, ibm, together, began, what, was, intended, as, the, follow, on, to, ms, dos, pc, dos, called, os, 2, when, os, 2, was, released, in, 1987, microsoft, began, an, advertising, campaign, announcing, that, dos, is, dead, and, stating, that, version, 4, was, the, last, full, release, os, 2, was, designed, for, efficient, multi, tasking, and, offered, a, number, of, advanced, features, that, had, been, designed, together, with, similar, look, and, feel, it, was, seen, as, the, legitimate, heir, to, the, kludgy, dos, platform, ms, dos, had, grown, in, spurts, with, many, significant, features, being, taken, or, duplicated, from, microsoft, s, other, products, and, operating, systems, ms, dos, also, grew, by, incorporating, by, direct, licensing, or, feature, duplicating, the, functionality, of, tools, and, utilities, developed, by, independent, companies, such, as, norton, utilities, pc, tools, microsoft, anti, virus, qemm, expanded, memory, manager, stacker, disk, compression, and, others, during, the, period, when, digital, research, was, competing, in, the, operating, system, market, some, computers, like, the, amstrad, pc1512, were, sold, with, floppy, disks, for, two, operating, systems, only, one, of, which, could, be, used, at, a, time, ms, dos, and, cp, m, 86, or, a, derivative, of, it, digital, research, produced, dos, plus, which, was, compatible, with, ms, dos, 2, 11, supported, cp, m, 86, programs, had, additional, features, including, multi, tasking, and, could, read, and, write, disks, in, cp, m, and, ms, dos, format, while, os, 2, was, under, protracted, development, digital, research, released, the, ms, dos, compatible, dr, dos, 5, 0, which, included, features, only, available, as, third, party, add, ons, for, ms, dos, unwilling, to, lose, any, portion, of, the, market, microsoft, responded, by, announcing, the, pending, release, of, ms, dos, 5, 0, in, may, 1990, this, effectively, killed, most, dr, dos, sales, until, the, actual, release, of, ms, dos, 5, 0, in, june, 1991, digital, research, brought, out, dr, dos, 6, 0, which, sold, well, until, the, pre, announcement, of, ms, dos, 6, 0, again, stifled, the, sales, of, dr, dos, microsoft, had, been, accused, of, carefully, orchestrating, leaks, about, future, versions, of, ms, dos, in, an, attempt, to, create, what, in, the, industry, is, called, fud, fear, uncertainty, and, doubt, regarding, dr, dos, for, example, in, october, 1990, shortly, after, the, release, of, dr, dos, 5, 0, and, long, before, the, eventual, june, 1991, release, of, ms, dos, 5, 0, stories, on, feature, enhancements, in, ms, dos, started, to, appear, in, infoworld, and, pc, week, brad, silverberg, then, vice, president, of, systems, software, at, microsoft, and, general, manager, of, its, windows, and, ms, dos, business, unit, wrote, a, forceful, letter, to, pc, week, november, 5, 1990, denying, that, microsoft, was, engaged, in, fud, tactics, to, serve, our, customers, better, we, decided, to, be, more, forthcoming, about, version, 5, 0, and, denying, that, microsoft, copied, features, from, dr, dos, the, feature, enhancements, of, ms, dos, version, 5, 0, were, decided, and, development, was, begun, long, before, we, heard, about, dr, dos, 5, 0, there, will, be, some, similar, features, with, 50, million, ms, dos, users, it, shouldn, t, be, surprising, that, dri, has, heard, some, of, the, same, requests, from, customers, that, we, have, schulman, et, al, 1994, the, pact, between, microsoft, and, ibm, to, promote, os, 2, began, to, fall, apart, in, 1990, when, windows, 3, 0, became, a, marketplace, success, many, of, microsoft, s, further, contributions, to, os, 2, also, went, into, creating, a, third, gui, replacement, for, dos, windows, nt, ibm, which, had, already, been, developing, the, next, version, of, os, 2, carried, on, development, of, the, platform, without, microsoft, and, sold, it, as, the, alternative, to, dos, and, windows, as, a, response, to, digital, research, s, dr, dos, 6, 0, which, bundled, superstor, disk, compression, microsoft, opened, negotiations, with, stac, electronics, vendor, of, the, most, popular, dos, disk, compression, tool, stacker, in, the, due, diligence, process, stac, engineers, had, shown, microsoft, part, of, the, stacker, source, code, stac, was, unwilling, to, meet, microsoft, s, terms, for, licensing, stacker, and, withdrew, from, the, negotiations, microsoft, chose, to, license, vertisoft, s, doubledisk, using, it, as, the, core, for, its, doublespace, disk, compression, ms, dos, 6, 0, and, 6, 20, were, released, in, 1993, both, including, the, microsoft, doublespace, disk, compression, utility, program, stac, successfully, sued, microsoft, for, patent, infringement, regarding, the, compression, algorithm, used, in, doublespace, this, resulted, in, the, 1994, release, of, ms, dos, 6, 21, which, had, disk, compression, removed, shortly, afterwards, came, version, 6, 22, with, a, new, version, of, the, disk, compression, system, drivespace, which, had, a, different, compression, algorithm, to, avoid, the, infringing, code, prior, to, 1995, microsoft, licensed, ms, dos, and, windows, to, computer, manufacturers, under, three, types, of, agreement, per, processor, a, fee, for, each, system, the, company, sold, per, system, a, fee, for, each, system, of, a, particular, model, or, per, copy, a, fee, for, each, copy, of, ms, dos, installed, the, largest, manufacturers, used, the, per, processor, arrangement, which, had, the, lowest, fee, this, arrangement, made, it, expensive, for, the, large, manufacturers, to, migrate, to, any, other, operating, system, such, as, dr, dos, in, 1991, the, u, s, government, federal, trade, commission, began, investigating, microsoft, s, licensing, procedures, resulting, in, a, 1994, settlement, agreement, limiting, microsoft, to, per, copy, licensing, digital, research, did, not, gain, by, this, settlement, and, years, later, its, successor, in, interest, caldera, sued, microsoft, for, damages, in, the, caldera, v, microsoft, lawsuit, it, was, believed, that, the, settlement, ran, in, the, order, of, 150, million, but, was, revealed, in, november, 2009, with, the, release, of, the, settlement, agreement, to, be, 280, million, microsoft, also, used, a, variety, of, tactics, in, ms, dos, and, several, of, their, applications, and, development, tools, that, while, operating, perfectly, when, running, on, genuine, ms, dos, and, pc, dos, would, break, when, run, on, another, vendor, s, implementation, of, dos, notable, examples, of, this, practice, included, all, versions, of, microsoft, windows, have, had, an, ms, dos, or, ms, dos, like, command, line, interface, called, ms, dos, prompt, which, redirected, input, to, ms, dos, and, output, from, ms, dos, to, the, ms, dos, prompt, or, in, later, versions, command, prompt, this, could, run, many, dos, and, variously, win32, os, 2, 1, x, and, posix, command, line, utilities, in, the, same, command, line, session, allowing, piping, between, commands, the, user, interface, and, the, icon, up, to, windows, 2000, followed, the, native, ms, dos, interface, the, command, prompt, introduced, with, windows, nt, is, not, actually, ms, dos, but, shares, some, commands, with, ms, dos, the, 16, bit, versions, of, windows, up, to, 3, 11, ran, as, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, on, top, of, ms, dos, with, windows, 95, 98, and, me, the, role, of, ms, dos, was, reduced, to, a, boot, loader, according, to, microsoft, with, ms, dos, programs, running, in, a, virtual, dos, machine, within, 32, bit, windows, with, ability, to, boot, directly, into, ms, dos, retained, as, a, backward, compatibility, option, for, applications, that, required, real, mode, access, to, the, hardware, which, was, generally, not, possible, within, windows, the, command, line, accessed, the, dos, command, line, usually, command, com, through, a, windows, module, winoldap, mod, windows, nt, based, operating, systems, boot, to, a, kernel, whose, purpose, is, to, load, windows, and, run, the, system, one, cannot, run, win32, applications, in, the, loader, system, in, the, manner, that, os, 2, unix, or, consumer, versions, of, windows, can, launch, character, mode, sessions, the, command, session, permits, running, various, supported, command, line, utilities, from, win32, ms, dos, os, 2, 1, x, and, posix, the, emulators, for, ms, dos, os, 2, and, posix, use, the, host, s, window, in, the, same, way, that, win16, applications, use, the, win32, explorer, using, the, host, s, window, allows, one, to, pipe, output, between, emulations, the, ms, dos, emulation, takes, place, through, the, ntvdm, nt, virtual, dos, machine, this, is, a, modified, softpc, a, former, product, similar, to, virtualpc, running, a, modified, ms, dos, 5, ntio, sys, and, ntdos, sys, the, output, is, handled, by, the, console, dlls, so, that, the, program, at, the, prompt, cmd, exe, 4nt, exe, tcc, exe, can, see, the, output, 64, bit, windows, has, neither, the, dos, emulation, nor, the, dos, commands, edit, debug, and, edlin, that, come, with, 32, bit, windows, the, dos, version, returns, 5, 00, or, 5, 50, depending, on, which, api, function, is, used, to, determine, it, utilities, from, ms, dos, 5, 00, run, in, this, emulation, without, modification, the, very, early, beta, programs, of, nt, show, ms, dos, 30, 00, but, programs, running, in, ms, dos, 30, 00, would, assume, that, os, 2, was, in, control, the, os, 2, emulation, is, handled, through, os2ss, exe, and, os2, exe, and, doscalls, dll, os2, exe, is, a, version, of, the, os, 2, shell, cmd, exe, which, passes, commands, down, to, the, os2ss, exe, and, input, output, to, the, windows, nt, shell, windows, 2000, was, the, last, version, of, nt, to, support, os, 2, the, emulation, is, os, 2, 1, 30, posix, is, emulated, through, the, posix, shell, but, no, emulated, shell, the, commands, are, handled, directly, in, cmd, exe, the, command, prompt, is, often, called, the, ms, dos, prompt, in, part, this, was, the, official, name, for, it, in, windows, 9x, and, early, versions, of, windows, nt, nt, 3, 5, and, earlier, and, in, part, because, the, softpc, emulation, of, dos, redirects, output, into, it, actually, only, command, com, and, other, 16, bit, commands, run, in, an, ntvdm, with, autoexec, nt, and, config, nt, initialization, determined, by, default, pif, optionally, permitting, the, use, of, win32, console, applications, and, internal, commands, with, an, ntcmdprompt, directive, win32, console, applications, use, cmd, exe, as, their, command, prompt, shell, this, confusion, does, not, exist, under, os, 2, because, there, are, separate, dos, and, os, 2, prompts, and, running, a, dos, program, under, os, 2, will, launch, a, separate, dos, window, to, run, the, application, all, versions, of, windows, for, itanium, no, longer, sold, by, microsoft, and, x86, 64, architectures, no, longer, include, the, ntvdm, and, can, therefore, no, longer, natively, run, dos, or, 16, bit, windows, applications, there, are, alternatives, such, as, virtual, machine, emulators, such, as, microsoft, s, own, virtual, pc, as, well, as, vmware, dosbox, etc, unofficial, compatibility, layers, such, as, ntvdmx64, otvdm, winevdm, win3mu, and, others, the, introduction, of, windows, 3, 0, in, 1990, with, an, easy, to, use, graphical, user, interface, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, for, the, command, line, driven, ms, dos, with, the, release, of, windows, 95, and, continuing, in, the, windows, 9x, product, line, through, to, windows, me, an, integrated, version, of, ms, dos, was, used, for, bootstrapping, troubleshooting, and, backwards, compatibility, with, old, dos, software, particularly, games, and, no, longer, released, as, a, standalone, product, in, windows, 95, the, dos, called, ms, dos, 7, can, be, booted, separately, without, the, windows, gui, this, capability, was, retained, through, windows, 98, second, edition, windows, me, removed, the, capability, to, boot, its, underlying, ms, dos, 8, 0, alone, from, a, hard, disk, but, retained, the, ability, to, make, a, dos, boot, floppy, disk, called, an, emergency, boot, disk, and, can, be, hacked, to, restore, full, access, to, the, underlying, dos, on, december, 31, 2001, microsoft, declared, all, versions, of, ms, dos, 6, 22, and, older, obsolete, and, stopped, providing, support, and, updates, for, the, system, as, ms, dos, 7, 0, was, a, part, of, windows, 95, support, for, it, also, ended, when, windows, 95, extended, support, ended, on, december, 31, 2001, as, ms, dos, 7, 10, and, ms, dos, 8, 0, were, part, of, windows, 98, and, windows, me, respectively, support, ended, when, windows, 98, and, me, extended, support, ended, on, july, 11, 2006, thus, ending, support, and, updates, of, ms, dos, from, microsoft, in, contrast, to, the, windows, 9x, series, the, windows, nt, derived, 32, bit, operating, systems, windows, nt, 2000, xp, and, newer, developed, alongside, the, 9x, series, do, not, contain, ms, dos, compatibility, as, a, core, component, of, the, operating, system, nor, do, they, rely, on, it, for, bootstrapping, as, nt, was, not, with, the, level, of, support, for, legacy, ms, dos, and, win16, apps, that, windows, 9x, was, but, does, provide, limited, dos, emulation, called, ntvdm, nt, virtual, dos, machine, to, run, dos, applications, and, provide, dos, like, command, prompt, windows, 64, bit, versions, of, windows, nt, prior, to, windows, 11, and, windows, server, 2008, r2, by, extension, do, not, provide, dos, emulation, and, cannot, run, dos, applications, natively, windows, xp, contains, a, copy, of, the, windows, me, boot, disk, stripped, down, to, bootstrap, only, this, is, accessible, only, by, formatting, a, floppy, as, an, ms, dos, startup, disk, files, like, the, driver, for, the, cd, rom, support, were, deleted, from, the, windows, me, bootdisk, and, the, startup, files, autoexec, bat, and, config, sys, no, longer, had, content, this, modified, disk, was, the, base, for, creating, the, ms, dos, image, for, windows, xp, some, of, the, deleted, files, can, be, recovered, with, an, undelete, tool, when, booting, up, an, ms, dos, startup, disk, made, with, windows, xp, s, format, tool, the, version, number, and, the, ver, internal, command, reports, as, windows, millennium, and, 5, 1, respectively, and, not, as, ms, dos, 8, 0, which, was, used, as, the, base, for, windows, me, but, never, released, as, a, stand, alone, product, though, the, api, still, says, version, 8, 0, when, creating, a, dos, startup, disk, on, windows, vista, the, files, on, the, startup, disk, are, dated, april, 18, 2005, but, are, otherwise, unchanged, including, the, string, ms, dos, version, 8, copyright, 1981, 1999, microsoft, corp, inside, command, com, windows, 7, 8, and, 8, 1, can, also, create, a, ms, dos, startup, disk, starting, with, windows, 10, the, ability, to, create, a, dos, startup, disk, has, been, removed, and, so, either, a, virtual, machine, running, ms, dos, or, an, older, version, in, a, virtual, machine, or, dual, boot, must, be, used, to, format, a, floppy, disk, or, an, image, must, be, obtained, from, an, external, source, other, solutions, include, using, dos, compatible, alternatives, such, as, freedos, or, even, copying, the, required, files, and, boot, sector, themselves, the, last, traces, of, ms, dos, were, removed, entirely, in, windows, with, windows, 11, when, the, ntvdm, component, was, discontinued, from, the, operating, system, due, to, it, being, no, longer, offered, in, 32, bit, versions, being, solely, offered, in, 64, bit, versions, only, effectively, ending, any, association, of, ms, dos, within, microsoft, windows, after, 36, years, ms, dos, 6, 22, was, the, last, standalone, version, produced, by, microsoft, for, intel, 8088, intel, 8086, and, intel, 80286, processors, which, remain, available, for, download, via, their, msdn, volume, license, and, oem, license, partner, websites, for, customers, with, valid, login, credentials, ms, dos, is, still, used, in, embedded, x86, systems, due, to, its, simple, architecture, and, minimal, memory, and, processor, requirements, though, some, current, products, have, switched, to, the, still, maintained, open, source, alternative, freedos, in, 2018, microsoft, released, the, source, code, for, ms, dos, 1, 25, and, 2, 0, on, github, the, purpose, of, this, according, to, microsoft, is, mainly, for, education, and, experimentation, with, historic, operating, systems, and, for, new, programmers, to, gain, an, understanding, of, how, low, level, software, works, both, historic, and, current, according, to, program, manager, rich, turner, the, other, versions, could, not, be, open, sourced, due, to, third, party, licensing, restrictions, in, 2024, microsoft, released, the, source, code, for, ms, dos, 4, 00, in, the, same, github, repository, due, to, the, historical, nature, of, the, software, microsoft, will, not, accept, any, pull, requests, to, the, code, users, however, are, allowed, and, fully, encouraged, to, fork, the, repository, containing, the, ms, dos, source, code, and, make, their, own, modifications, and, do, whatever, they, like, with, it, from, 1983, onwards, various, companies, worked, on, graphical, user, interfaces, guis, capable, of, running, on, pc, hardware, however, this, required, duplicated, effort, and, did, not, provide, much, consistency, in, interface, design, even, between, products, from, the, same, company, later, in, 1985, microsoft, windows, 1, 0, was, released, as, microsoft, s, first, attempt, at, providing, a, consistent, user, interface, for, applications, the, early, versions, of, windows, ran, on, top, of, ms, dos, at, first, windows, met, with, little, success, but, this, was, also, true, for, most, other, companies, efforts, as, well, for, example, gem, after, version, 3, 0, windows, gained, market, acceptance, windows, 9x, used, ms, dos, to, boot, the, windows, kernel, in, protected, mode, basic, features, related, to, the, file, system, such, as, long, file, names, were, only, available, to, dos, applications, when, running, through, windows, windows, nt, runs, independently, of, dos, but, includes, ntvdm, a, component, for, simulating, a, dos, environment, for, legacy, applications, this, component, would, eventually, be, retired, starting, with, windows, 11, as, the, operating, system, is, only, being, offered, in, 64, bit, architectures, such, as, x86, 64, ms, dos, compatible, systems, include, microsoft, made, ibm, pc, dos, for, ibm, it, and, ms, dos, were, identical, products, that, eventually, diverged, starting, with, ms, dos, version, 6, 0, digital, research, did, not, follow, microsoft, s, version, numbering, scheme, for, example, ms, dos, 4, released, in, july, 1988, was, followed, by, dr, dos, 5, 0, in, may, 1990, ms, dos, 5, 0, came, in, april, 1991, and, dr, dos, 6, 0, was, released, the, following, june, these, products, are, collectively, referred, to, as, dos, even, though, disk, operating, system, is, a, generic, term, used, on, other, systems, unrelated, to, the, x86, and, ibm, pc, ms, dos, can, also, be, a, generic, reference, to, dos, on, ibm, pc, compatible, computers, microsoft, s, control, of, the, windows, platform, and, their, programming, practices, which, intentionally, made, windows, appear, as, if, it, ran, poorly, on, competing, versions, of, dos, crippled, the, ability, of, other, dos, makers, to, continue, to, compete, with, ms, dos, digital, research, had, to, release, interim, releases, to, circumvent, windows, limitations, inserted, artificially, designed, specifically, to, provide, microsoft, with, a, competitive, advantage
