the, aswan, dam, or, more, specifically, since, the, 1980s, the, aswan, high, dam, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, embankment, dams, which, was, built, across, the, nile, in, aswan, egypt, between, 1960, and, 1970, when, it, was, completed, it, was, the, tallest, earthen, dam, in, the, world, eclipsing, the, united, states, chatuge, dam, the, dam, created, a, reservoir, named, lake, nasser, its, significance, largely, upstaged, the, previous, aswan, low, dam, initially, completed, in, 1902, downstream, based, on, the, success, of, the, low, dam, then, at, its, maximum, utilization, construction, of, the, high, dam, became, a, key, objective, of, the, new, regime, the, free, officers, movement, of, 1952, with, its, ability, to, better, control, flooding, provide, increased, water, storage, for, irrigation, and, generate, hydroelectricity, the, dam, was, seen, as, pivotal, to, egypt, s, planned, industrialization, like, the, earlier, implementation, the, high, dam, has, had, a, significant, effect, on, the, economy, and, culture, of, egypt, before, the, high, dam, was, built, even, with, the, old, dam, in, place, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, during, late, summer, had, continued, to, pass, largely, unimpeded, down, the, valley, from, its, east, african, drainage, basin, these, floods, brought, high, water, with, natural, nutrients, and, minerals, that, annually, enriched, the, fertile, soil, along, its, floodplain, and, delta, this, predictability, had, made, the, nile, valley, ideal, for, farming, since, ancient, times, however, this, natural, flooding, varied, since, high, water, years, could, destroy, the, whole, crop, while, low, water, years, could, create, widespread, drought, and, consequently, famine, both, these, events, had, continued, to, occur, periodically, as, egypt, s, population, grew, and, technology, increased, both, a, desire, and, the, ability, developed, to, completely, control, the, flooding, and, thus, both, protect, and, support, farmland, and, its, economically, important, cotton, crop, with, the, greatly, increased, reservoir, storage, provided, by, the, high, aswan, dam, the, floods, could, be, controlled, and, the, water, could, be, stored, for, later, release, over, multiple, years, the, aswan, dam, was, designed, by, nikolai, aleksandrovich, malyshev, of, the, moscow, based, hydroproject, institute, designed, for, both, irrigation, and, power, generation, the, dam, incorporates, a, number, of, relatively, new, features, including, a, very, deep, grout, curtain, below, its, base, although, the, reservoir, will, eventually, silt, in, even, the, most, conservative, estimates, indicate, the, dam, will, give, at, least, 200, years, of, service, the, earliest, recorded, attempt, to, build, a, dam, near, aswan, was, in, the, 11th, century, when, the, arab, polymath, and, engineer, ibn, al, haytham, known, as, alhazen, in, the, west, was, summoned, to, egypt, by, the, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, to, regulate, the, flooding, of, the, nile, a, task, requiring, an, early, attempt, at, an, aswan, dam, his, field, work, convinced, him, of, the, impracticality, of, this, scheme, the, british, began, construction, of, the, first, dam, across, the, nile, in, 1898, construction, lasted, until, 1902, and, the, dam, was, opened, on, 10, december, 1902, the, project, was, designed, by, sir, william, willcocks, and, involved, several, eminent, engineers, including, sir, benjamin, baker, and, sir, john, aird, whose, firm, john, aird, co, was, the, main, contractor, in, 1952, the, greek, egyptian, engineer, adrian, daninos, began, to, develop, the, plan, of, the, new, aswan, dam, although, the, low, dam, was, almost, overtopped, in, 1946, the, government, of, king, farouk, showed, no, interest, in, daninos, s, plans, instead, the, nile, valley, plan, by, the, british, hydrologist, harold, edwin, hurst, was, favored, which, proposed, to, store, water, in, sudan, and, ethiopia, where, evaporation, is, much, lower, the, egyptian, position, changed, completely, after, the, overthrow, of, the, monarchy, led, by, the, free, officers, movement, including, gamal, abdel, nasser, the, free, officers, were, convinced, that, the, nile, waters, had, to, be, stored, in, egypt, for, political, reasons, and, within, two, months, the, plan, of, daninos, was, accepted, initially, both, the, united, states, and, the, ussr, were, interested, in, helping, development, of, the, dam, complications, ensued, due, to, their, rivalry, during, the, cold, war, as, well, as, growing, intra, arab, tensions, in, 1955, nasser, was, claiming, to, be, the, leader, of, arab, nationalism, in, opposition, to, the, traditional, monarchies, especially, the, hashemite, kingdom, of, iraq, following, its, signing, of, the, 1955, baghdad, pact, at, that, time, the, u, s, feared, that, communism, would, spread, to, the, middle, east, and, it, saw, nasser, as, a, natural, leader, of, an, anticommunist, procapitalist, arab, league, america, and, the, united, kingdom, offered, to, help, finance, construction, of, the, high, dam, with, a, loan, of, 270, million, in, return, for, nasser, s, leadership, in, resolving, the, arab, israeli, conflict, while, opposed, to, communism, capitalism, and, imperialism, nasser, identified, as, a, tactical, neutralist, and, sought, to, work, with, both, the, u, s, and, the, ussr, for, egyptian, and, arab, benefit, after, the, un, criticized, a, raid, by, israel, against, egyptian, forces, in, gaza, in, 1955, nasser, realized, that, he, could, not, portray, himself, as, the, leader, of, pan, arab, nationalism, if, he, could, not, defend, his, country, militarily, against, israel, in, addition, to, his, development, plans, he, looked, to, quickly, modernize, his, military, and, he, turned, first, to, the, u, s, for, aid, american, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, and, president, dwight, eisenhower, told, nasser, that, the, u, s, would, supply, him, with, weapons, only, if, they, were, used, for, defensive, purposes, and, if, he, accepted, american, military, personnel, for, supervision, and, training, nasser, did, not, accept, these, conditions, and, consulted, the, ussr, for, support, although, dulles, believed, that, nasser, was, only, bluffing, and, that, the, ussr, would, not, aid, nasser, he, was, wrong, the, ussr, promised, nasser, a, quantity, of, arms, in, exchange, for, a, deferred, payment, of, egyptian, grain, and, cotton, on, 27, september, 1955, nasser, announced, an, arms, deal, with, czechoslovakia, acting, as, a, middleman, for, the, soviet, support, instead, of, attacking, nasser, for, turning, to, the, soviets, dulles, sought, to, improve, relations, with, him, in, december, 1955, the, us, and, the, uk, pledged, 56, and, 14, million, respectively, toward, construction, of, the, high, aswan, dam, though, the, czech, arms, deal, created, an, incentive, for, the, us, to, invest, at, aswan, the, uk, cited, the, deal, as, a, reason, for, repealing, its, promise, of, dam, funds, dulles, was, angered, more, by, nasser, s, diplomatic, recognition, of, china, which, was, in, direct, conflict, with, dulles, s, policy, of, containment, of, communism, several, other, factors, contributed, to, the, us, deciding, to, withdraw, its, offer, of, funding, for, the, dam, dulles, believed, that, the, ussr, would, not, fulfill, its, commitment, of, military, aid, he, was, also, irritated, by, nasser, s, neutrality, and, attempts, to, play, both, sides, of, the, cold, war, at, the, time, other, western, allies, in, the, middle, east, including, turkey, and, iraq, were, resentful, that, egypt, a, persistently, neutral, country, was, being, offered, so, much, aid, in, june, 1956, the, soviets, offered, nasser, 1, 12, billion, at, 2, interest, for, the, construction, of, the, dam, on, 19, july, the, u, s, state, department, announced, that, american, financial, assistance, for, the, high, dam, was, not, feasible, in, present, circumstances, on, 26, july, 1956, with, wide, egyptian, acclaim, nasser, announced, the, nationalization, of, the, suez, canal, that, included, fair, compensation, for, the, former, owners, nasser, planned, on, the, revenues, generated, by, the, canal, to, help, fund, construction, of, the, high, dam, when, the, suez, war, broke, out, the, united, kingdom, france, and, israel, seized, the, canal, and, the, sinai, but, pressure, from, the, u, s, and, the, ussr, at, the, united, nations, and, elsewhere, forced, them, to, withdraw, in, 1958, the, ussr, proceeded, to, provide, support, for, the, high, dam, project, in, the, 1950s, archaeologists, began, raising, concerns, that, several, major, historical, sites, including, the, famous, temple, of, abu, simbel, were, about, to, be, submerged, by, waters, collected, behind, the, dam, a, rescue, operation, began, in, 1960, under, unesco, for, details, see, below, under, effects, despite, its, size, the, aswan, project, has, not, materially, hurt, the, egyptian, balance, of, payments, the, three, soviet, credits, covered, virtually, all, of, the, project, s, foreign, exchange, requirements, including, the, cost, of, technical, services, imported, power, generating, and, transmission, equipment, and, some, imported, equipment, for, land, reclamation, egypt, was, not, seriously, burdened, by, payments, on, the, credits, most, of, which, were, extended, for, 12, years, with, interest, at, the, very, low, rate, of, 2, 1, 2, repayments, to, the, ussr, constituted, only, a, small, net, drain, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1960s, and, increased, export, earnings, derived, from, crops, grown, on, newly, reclaimed, land, have, largely, offset, the, modest, debt, service, payments, in, recent, years, during, 1965, 70, these, export, earnings, amounted, to, an, estimated, 126, million, compared, with, debt, service, payments, of, 113, million, the, soviets, also, provided, technicians, and, heavy, machinery, the, enormous, rock, and, clay, dam, was, designed, by, nikolai, aleksandrovich, malyshev, of, the, moscow, based, hydroproject, institute, along, with, some, egyptian, engineers, 25, 000, egyptian, engineers, and, workers, contributed, to, the, construction, of, the, dams, originally, designed, by, west, german, and, french, engineers, in, the, early, 1950s, and, slated, for, financing, with, western, credits, the, aswan, high, dam, became, the, ussr, s, largest, and, most, famous, foreign, aid, project, after, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, the, international, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, ibrd, withdrew, their, support, in, 1956, the, first, soviet, loan, of, 100, million, to, cover, construction, of, coffer, dams, for, diversion, of, the, nile, was, extended, in, 1958, an, additional, 225, million, was, extended, in, 1960, to, complete, the, dam, and, construct, power, generating, facilities, and, subsequently, about, 100, million, was, made, available, for, land, reclamation, these, credits, of, some, 425, million, covered, only, the, foreign, exchange, costs, of, the, project, including, salaries, of, soviet, engineers, who, supervised, the, project, and, were, responsible, for, the, installation, and, testing, of, soviet, equipment, actual, construction, which, began, in, 1960, was, done, by, egyptian, companies, on, contract, to, the, high, dam, authority, and, all, domestic, costs, were, borne, by, the, egyptians, egyptian, participation, in, the, venture, has, raised, the, construction, industry, s, capacity, and, reputation, significantly, on, the, egyptian, side, the, project, was, led, by, osman, ahmed, osman, s, arab, contractors, the, relatively, young, osman, underbid, his, only, competitor, by, one, half, the, aswan, high, dam, is, 3, 830, metres, 12, 570, ft, long, 980, m, 3, 220, ft, wide, at, the, base, 40, m, 130, ft, wide, at, the, crest, and, 111, m, 364, ft, tall, it, contains, 43, 000, 000, cubic, metres, 56, 000, 000, cu, yd, of, material, at, maximum, 11, 000, cubic, metres, per, second, 390, 000, cu, ft, s, of, water, can, pass, through, the, dam, there, are, further, emergency, spillways, for, an, extra, 5, 000, cubic, metres, per, second, 180, 000, cu, ft, s, and, the, toshka, canal, links, the, reservoir, to, the, toshka, depression, the, reservoir, named, lake, nasser, is, 500, km, 310, mi, long, and, 35, km, 22, mi, at, its, widest, with, a, surface, area, of, 5, 250, square, kilometres, 2, 030, sq, mi, it, holds, 132, cubic, kilometres, 1, 73, 10, 11, cu, yd, of, water, due, to, the, absence, of, appreciable, rainfall, egypt, s, agriculture, depends, entirely, on, irrigation, with, irrigation, two, crops, per, year, can, be, produced, except, for, sugar, cane, which, has, a, growing, period, of, almost, one, year, the, high, dam, at, aswan, releases, on, average, 55, cubic, kilometres, 45, 000, 000, acre, ft, water, per, year, of, which, some, 46, cubic, kilometres, 37, 000, 000, acre, ft, are, diverted, into, the, irrigation, canals, in, the, nile, valley, and, delta, almost, 336, 000, square, kilometres, 130, 000, sq, mi, benefit, from, these, waters, producing, on, average, 1, 8, crops, per, year, the, annual, crop, consumptive, use, of, water, is, about, 38, cubic, kilometres, 31, 000, 000, acre, ft, hence, the, overall, irrigation, efficiency, is, 38, 46, 0, 826, or, 83, this, is, a, relatively, high, irrigation, efficiency, the, field, irrigation, efficiencies, are, much, less, but, the, losses, are, reused, downstream, this, continuous, reuse, accounts, for, the, high, overall, efficiency, the, following, table, shows, the, distribution, of, irrigation, water, over, the, branch, canals, taking, off, from, the, one, main, irrigation, canal, the, mansuriya, canal, near, giza, the, salt, concentration, of, the, water, in, the, aswan, reservoir, is, about, 0, 25, kilograms, per, cubic, metre, 0, 42, lb, cu, yd, a, very, low, salinity, level, at, an, annual, inflow, of, 55, cubic, kilometres, 45, 000, 000, acre, ft, the, annual, salt, influx, reaches, 14, million, tons, the, average, salt, concentration, of, the, drainage, water, evacuated, into, the, sea, and, the, coastal, lakes, is, 2, 7, kilograms, per, cubic, metre, 4, 6, lb, cu, yd, at, an, annual, discharge, of, 10, cubic, kilometres, 2, 4, cu, mi, not, counting, the, 2, kilograms, per, cubic, metre, of, salt,

egypt, s, agricultural, lands, were, desalinizing, part, of, this, could, be, due, to, the, large, number, of, subsurface, drainage, projects, executed, in, the, last, decades, to, control, the, water, table, and, soil, salinity, drainage, through, subsurface, drains, and, drainage, channels, is, essential, to, prevent, a, deterioration, of, crop, yields, from, waterlogging, and, soil, salinization, caused, by, irrigation, by, 2003, more, than, 20, 000, square, kilometres, 7, 700, sq, mi, have, been, equipped, with, a, subsurface, drainage, system, and, approximately, 7, 2, square, kilometres, 2, 8, sq, mi, of, water, is, drained, annually, from, areas, with, these, systems, the, total, investment, cost, in, agricultural, drainage, over, 27, years, from, 1973, to, 2002, was, about, 3, 1, billion, covering, the, cost, of, design, construction, maintenance, research, and, training, during, this, period, 11, large, scale, projects, were, implemented, with, financial, support, from, world, bank, and, other, donors, the, high, dam, has, resulted, in, protection, from, floods, and, droughts, an, increase, in, agricultural, production, and, employment, electricity, production, and, improved, navigation, that, also, benefits, tourism, conversely, the, dam, flooded, a, large, area, causing, the, relocation, of, over, 100, 000, people, many, archaeological, sites, were, submerged, while, others, were, relocated, the, dam, is, blamed, for, coastline, erosion, soil, salinity, and, health, problems, the, assessment, of, the, costs, and, benefits, of, the, dam, remains, controversial, decades, after, its, completion, according, to, one, estimate, the, annual, economic, benefit, of, the, high, dam, immediately, after, its, completion, was, e, 255, million, 587, million, using, the, exchange, rate, in, 1970, of, 2, 30, per, e, 1, e, 140, million, from, agricultural, production, e, 100, million, from, hydroelectric, generation, e, 10, million, from, flood, protection, and, e, 5, million, from, improved, navigation, at, the, time, of, its, construction, total, cost, including, unspecified, subsidiary, projects, and, the, extension, of, electric, power, lines, amounted, to, e, 450, million, not, taking, into, account, the, negative, environmental, and, social, effects, of, the, dam, its, costs, are, thus, estimated, to, have, been, recovered, within, only, two, years, one, observer, notes, the, impacts, of, the, aswan, high, dam, have, been, overwhelmingly, positive, although, the, dam, has, contributed, to, some, environmental, problems, these, have, proved, to, be, significantly, less, severe, than, was, generally, expected, or, currently, believed, by, many, people, another, observer, disagreed, and, he, recommended, that, the, dam, should, be, torn, down, tearing, it, down, would, cost, only, a, fraction, of, the, funds, required, for, continually, combating, the, dam, s, consequential, damage, and, 500, 000, hectares, 1, 900, sq, mi, of, fertile, land, could, be, reclaimed, from, the, layers, of, mud, on, the, bed, of, the, drained, reservoir, samuel, c, florman, wrote, about, the, dam, as, a, structure, it, is, a, success, but, in, its, effect, on, the, ecology, of, the, nile, basin, most, of, which, could, have, been, predicted, it, is, a, failure, periodic, floods, and, droughts, have, affected, egypt, since, ancient, times, the, dam, mitigated, the, effects, of, floods, such, as, those, in, 1964, 1973, and, 1988, navigation, along, the, river, has, been, improved, both, upstream, and, downstream, of, the, dam, sailing, along, the, nile, is, a, favorite, tourism, activity, which, is, mainly, done, during, the, winter, when, the, natural, flow, of, the, nile, would, have, been, too, low, to, allow, navigation, of, cruise, ships, a, new, fishing, industry, has, been, created, around, lake, nasser, though, it, is, struggling, due, to, its, distance, from, any, significant, markets, the, annual, production, was, about, 35, 000, tons, in, the, mid, 1990s, factories, for, the, fishing, industry, and, packaging, have, been, set, up, near, the, lake, according, to, a, 1971, cia, declassified, report, although, the, high, dam, has, not, created, ecological, problems, as, serious, as, some, observers, have, charged, its, construction, has, brought, economic, losses, as, well, as, gains, these, losses, derive, largely, from, the, settling, in, dam, s, lake, of, the, rich, silt, traditionally, borne, by, the, nile, to, date, 1971, the, main, impact, has, been, on, the, fishing, industry, egypt, s, mediterranean, catch, which, once, averaged, 35, 000, 40, 000, tons, annually, has, shrunk, to, 20, 000, tons, or, less, largely, because, the, loss, of, plankton, nourished, by, the, silt, has, eliminated, the, sardine, population, in, egyptian, waters, fishing, in, high, dam, s, lake, may, in, time, at, least, partly, offset, the, loss, of, saltwater, fish, but, only, the, most, optimistic, estimates, place, the, eventual, catch, as, high, as, 15, 000, 20, 000, tons, lack, of, continuing, silt, deposits, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, also, has, contributed, to, a, serious, erosion, problem, commercial, fertilizer, requirements, and, salination, and, drainage, difficulties, already, large, in, perennially, irrigated, areas, of, lower, and, middle, egypt, will, be, somewhat, increased, in, upper, egypt, by, the, change, to, perennial, irrigation, the, dams, also, protected, egypt, from, the, droughts, in, 1972, 73, and, 1983, 87, that, devastated, east, and, west, africa, the, high, dam, allowed, egypt, to, reclaim, about, 2, 0, million, feddan, 840, 000, hectares, in, the, nile, delta, and, along, the, nile, valley, increasing, the, country, s, irrigated, area, by, a, third, the, increase, was, brought, about, both, by, irrigating, what, used, to, be, desert, and, by, bringing, under, cultivation, of, 385, 000, hectares, 950, 000, acres, that, were, previously, used, as, flood, retention, basins, about, half, a, million, families, were, settled, on, these, new, lands, in, particular, the, area, under, rice, and, sugar, cane, cultivation, increased, in, addition, about, 1, million, feddan, 420, 000, hectares, mostly, in, upper, egypt, were, converted, from, flood, irrigation, with, only, one, crop, per, year, to, perennial, irrigation, allowing, two, or, more, crops, per, year, on, other, previously, irrigated, land, yields, increased, because, water, could, be, made, available, at, critical, low, flow, periods, for, example, wheat, yields, in, egypt, tripled, between, 1952, and, 1991, and, better, availability, of, water, contributed, to, this, increase, most, of, the, 32, km, 3, of, freshwater, or, almost, 40, percent, of, the, average, flow, of, the, nile, that, were, previously, lost, to, the, sea, every, year, could, be, put, to, beneficial, use, while, about, 10, km, 3, of, the, water, saved, is, lost, due, to, evaporation, in, lake, nasser, the, amount, of, water, available, for, irrigation, still, increased, by, 22, km, 3, other, estimates, put, evaporation, from, lake, nasser, at, between, 10, and, 16, cubic, km, per, year, the, dam, powers, twelve, generators, each, rated, at, 175, megawatts, 235, 000, hp, with, a, total, of, 2, 1, gigawatts, 2, 800, 000, hp, power, generation, began, in, 1967, when, the, high, dam, first, reached, peak, output, in, 1970, it, produced, around, half, of, egypt, s, production, of, electric, power, about, 15, percent, by, 1998, and, it, gave, most, egyptian, villages, the, use, of, electricity, for, the, first, time, the, high, dam, has, also, improved, the, efficiency, and, the, extension, of, the, old, aswan, hydropower, stations, by, regulating, upstream, flows, at, the, time, of, completion, it, was, the, largest, power, station, in, africa, and, the, 6th, largest, hydroelectric, power, station, in, the, world, all, high, dam, power, facilities, were, completed, ahead, of, schedule, 12, turbines, were, installed, and, tested, giving, the, plant, an, installed, capacity, of, 2, 100, megawatts, mw, or, more, than, twice, the, national, total, in, 1960, with, this, capacity, the, aswan, plant, can, produce, 10, billion, kwh, of, energy, yearly, two, 500, kilovolt, trunk, lines, to, cairo, have, been, completed, and, initial, transmission, problems, stemming, mainly, from, poor, insulators, were, solved, also, the, damage, inflicted, on, a, main, transformer, station, in, 1968, by, israeli, commandos, has, been, repaired, and, the, aswan, plant, is, fully, integrated, with, the, power, network, in, lower, egypt, by, 1971, estimation, power, output, at, aswan, won, t, reach, much, more, than, half, of, the, plant, s, theoretical, capacity, because, of, limited, water, supplies, and, the, differing, seasonal, water, use, patterns, for, irrigation, and, power, production, agricultural, demand, for, water, in, the, summer, far, exceeds, the, amount, needed, to, meet, the, comparatively, low, summer, demand, for, electric, power, heavy, summer, irrigation, use, however, will, leave, insufficient, water, under, egyptian, control, to, permit, hydroelectric, power, production, at, full, capacity, in, the, winter, technical, studies, indicate, that, a, maximum, annual, output, of, 5, billion, kwh, appears, to, be, all, that, can, be, sustained, due, to, fluctuations, in, nile, flows, lake, nasser, flooded, much, of, lower, nubia, and, 100, 000, to, 120, 000, people, were, resettled, in, sudan, and, egypt, in, sudan, 50, 000, to, 70, 000, sudanese, nubians, were, moved, from, the, old, town, of, wadi, halfa, and, its, surrounding, villages, some, were, moved, to, a, newly, created, settlement, on, the, shore, of, lake, nasser, called, new, wadi, halfa, and, some, were, resettled, approximately, 700, kilometres, 430, mi, south, to, the, semi, arid, butana, plain, near, the, town, of, khashm, el, girba, up, the, atbara, river, the, climate, there, had, a, regular, rainy, season, as, opposed, to, their, previous, desert, habitat, in, which, virtually, no, rain, fell, the, government, developed, an, irrigation, project, called, the, new, halfa, agricultural, development, scheme, to, grow, cotton, grains, sugar, cane, and, other, crops, the, nubians, were, resettled, in, twenty, five, planned, villages, that, included, schools, medical, facilities, and, other, services, including, piped, water, and, some, electrification, in, egypt, the, majority, of, the, 50, 000, nubians, were, moved, three, to, ten, kilometers, from, the, nile, near, edna, and, kom, ombo, 45, kilometers, 28, mi, downstream, from, aswan, in, what, was, called, new, nubia, housing, and, facilities, were, built, for, 47, village, units, whose, relationship, to, each, other, approximated, that, in, old, nubia, irrigated, land, was, provided, to, grow, mainly, sugar, cane, in, 2019, 20, egypt, started, to, compensate, the, nubians, who, lost, their, homes, following, the, dam, impoundment, twenty, two, monuments, and, architectural, complexes, that, were, threatened, by, flooding, from, lake, nasser, including, the, abu, simbel, temples, were, preserved, by, moving, them, to, the, shores, of, the, lake, under, the, unesco, nubia, campaign, also, moved, were, philae, kalabsha, and, amada, these, monuments, were, granted, to, countries, that, helped, with, the, works, these, items, were, removed, to, the, garden, area, of, the, sudan, national, museum, of, khartoum, the, temple, of, ptah, at, gerf, hussein, had, its, free, standing, section, reconstructed, at, new, kalabsha, alongside, the, temple, of, kalabsha, beit, el, wali, and, the, kiosk, of, qertassi, the, remaining, archaeological, sites, including, the, buhen, fort, and, the, cemetery, of, fadrus, have, been, flooded, by, lake, nasser, before, the, construction, of, the, high, dam, the, nile, deposited, sediments, of, various, particle, size, consisting, of, fine, sand, silt, and, clay, on, fields, in, upper, egypt, through, its, annual, flood, contributing, to, soil, fertility, however, the, nutrient, value, of, the, sediment, has, often, been, overestimated, 88, percent, of, the, sediment, was, carried, to, the, sea, before, the, construction, of, the, high, dam, the, nutrient, value, added, to, the, land, by, the, sediment, was, only, 6, 000, tons, of, potash, 7, 000, tons, of, phosphorus, pentoxide, and, 17, 000, tons, of, nitrogen, these, amounts, are, insignificant, compared, to, what, is, needed, to, reach, the, yields, achieved, today, in, egypt, s, irrigation, also, the, annual, spread, of, sediment, due, to, the, nile, floods, occurred, along, the, banks, of, the, nile, areas, far, from, the, river, which, never, received, the, nile, floods, before, are, now, being, irrigated, a, more, serious, issue, of, trapping, of, sediment, by, the, dam, is, that, it, has, increased, coastline, erosion, surrounding, the, nile, delta, there, is, a, lack, of, reliable, statistics, before, the, construction, of, the, high, dam, groundwater, levels, in, the, nile, valley, fluctuated, 8, 9, m, 26, 30, ft, per, year, with, the, water, level, of, the, nile, during, summer, when, evaporation, was, highest, the, groundwater, level, was, too, deep, to, allow, salts, dissolved, in, the, water, to, be, pulled, to, the, surface, through, capillary, action, with, the, disappearance, of, the, annual, flood, and, heavy, year, round, irrigation, groundwater, levels, remained, high, with, little, fluctuation, leading, to, waterlogging, soil, salinity, also, increased, because, the, distance, between, the, surface, and, the, groundwater, table, was, small, enough, 1, 2, m, depending, on, soil, conditions, and, temperature, to, allow, water, to, be, pulled, up, by, evaporation, so, that, the, relatively, small, concentrations, of, salt, in, the, groundwater, accumulated, on, the, soil, surface, over, the, years, since, most, of, the, farmland, did, not, have, proper, subsurface, drainage, to, lower, the, groundwater, table, salinization, gradually, affected, crop, yields, drainage, through, sub, surface, drains, and, drainage, channels, is, essential, to, prevent, a, deterioration, of, crop, yields, from, soil, salinization, and, waterlogging, by, 2003, more, than, 2, million, hectares, have, been, equipped, with, a, subsurface, drainage, system, at, a, cost, from, 1973, to, 2002, of, about, 3, 1, billion, contrary, to, many, predictions, made, prior, to, the, aswan, high, dam, construction, and, publications, that, followed, that, the, prevalence, of, schistosomiasis, bilharzia, would, increase, it, did, not, this, assumption, did, not, take, into, account, the, extent, of, perennial, irrigation, that, was, already, present, throughout, egypt, decades, before, the, high, dam, closure, by, the, 1950s, only, a, small, proportion, of, upper, egypt, had, not, been, converted, from, basin, low, transmission, to, perennial, high, transmission, irrigation, expansion, of, perennial, irrigation, systems, in, egypt, did, not, depend, on, the, high, dam, in, fact, within, 15, years, of, the, high, dam, closure, there, was, solid, evidence, that, bilharzia, was, declining, in, upper, egypt, s, haematobium, has, since, disappeared, altogether, suggested, reasons, for, this, include, improvements, in, irrigation, practice, in, the, nile, delta, schistosomiasis, had, been, highly, endemic, with, prevalence, in, the, villages, 50, or, higher, for, almost, a, century, before, this, was, a, consequence, of, the, conversion, of, the, delta, to, perennial, irrigation, to, grow, long, staple, cotton, by, the, british, this, has, changed, large, scale, treatment, programmes, in, the, 1990s, using, single, dose, oral, medication, contributed, greatly, to, reducing, the, prevalence, and, severity, of, s, mansoni, in, the, delta, sediment, deposited, in, the, reservoir, is, lowering, the, water, storage, capacity, of, lake, nasser, the, reservoir, storage, capacity, is, 162, km, 3, including, 31, km, 3, dead, storage, at, the, bottom, of, the, lake, below, 147, m, 482, ft, above, sea, level, 90, km, 3, live, storage, and, 41, km, 3, of, storage, for, high, flood, waters, above, 175, m, 574, ft, above, sea, level, the, annual, sediment, load, of, the, nile, is, about, 134, million, tons, this, means, that, the, dead, storage, volume, would, be, filled, up, after, 300, 500, years, if, the, sediment, accumulated, at, the, same, rate, throughout, the, area, of, the, lake, obviously, sediment, accumulates, much, faster, at, the, upper, reaches, of, the, lake, where, sedimentation, has, already, affected, the, live, storage, zone, before, the, construction, of, the, high, dam, the, 50, 000, km, 31, 000, mi, of, irrigation, and, drainage, canals, in, egypt, had, to, be, dredged, regularly, to, remove, sediments, after, construction, of, the, dam, aquatic, weeds, grew, much, faster, in, the, clearer, water, helped, by, fertilizer, residues, the, total, length, of, the, infested, waterways, was, about, 27, 000, km, 17, 000, mi, in, the, mid, 1990s, weeds, have, been, gradually, brought, under, control, by, manual, mechanical, and, biological, methods, mediterranean, fishing, and, brackish, water, lake, fishery, declined, after, the, dam, was, finished, because, nutrients, that, flowed, down, the, nile, to, the, mediterranean, were, trapped, behind, the, dam, for, example, the, sardine, catch, off, the, egyptian, coast, declined, from, 18, 000, tons, in, 1962, to, a, mere, 460, tons, in, 1968, but, then, gradually, recovered, to, 8, 590, tons, in, 1992, a, scientific, article, in, the, mid, 1990s, noted, that, the, mismatch, between, low, primary, productivity, and, relatively, high, levels, of, fish, production, in, the, region, still, presents, a, puzzle, to, scientists, a, concern, before, the, construction, of, the, high, dam, had, been, the, potential, drop, in, river, bed, level, downstream, of, the, dam, as, the, result, of, erosion, caused, by, the, flow, of, sediment, free, water, estimates, by, various, national, and, international, experts, put, this, drop, at, between, and, 2, and, 10, meters, 6, 6, and, 32, 8, ft, however, the, actual, drop, has, been, measured, at, 0, 3, 0, 7, meters, 0, 98, 2, 30, ft, much, less, than, expected, the, red, brick, construction, industry, which, consisted, of, hundreds, of, factories, that, used, nile, sediment, deposits, along, the, river, has, also, been, negatively, affected, deprived, of, sediment, they, started, using, the, older, alluvium, of, otherwise, arable, land, taking, out, of, production, up, to, 120, square, kilometers, 46, sq, mi, annually, with, an, estimated, 1, 000, square, kilometers, 390, sq, mi, destroyed, by, 1984, when, the, government, prohibited, with, only, modest, success, further, excavation, according, to, one, source, bricks, are, now, being, made, from, new, techniques, which, use, a, sand, clay, mixture, and, it, has, been, argued, that, the, mud, based, brick, industry, would, have, suffered, even, if, the, dam, had, not, been, built, because, of, the, lower, turbidity, of, the, water, sunlight, penetrates, deeper, in, the, nile, water, because, of, this, and, the, increased, presence, of, nutrients, from, fertilizers, in, the, water, more, algae, grow, in, the, nile, this, in, turn, increases, the, costs, of, drinking, water, treatment, apparently, few, experts, had, expected, that, water, quality, in, the, nile, would, actually, decrease, because, of, the, high, dam
