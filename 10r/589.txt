the, optical, microscope, also, referred, to, as, a, light, microscope, is, a, type, of, microscope, that, commonly, uses, visible, light, and, a, system, of, lenses, to, generate, magnified, images, of, small, objects, optical, microscopes, are, the, oldest, design, of, microscope, and, were, possibly, invented, in, their, present, compound, form, in, the, 17th, century, basic, optical, microscopes, can, be, very, simple, although, many, complex, designs, aim, to, improve, resolution, and, sample, contrast, the, object, is, placed, on, a, stage, and, may, be, directly, viewed, through, one, or, two, eyepieces, on, the, microscope, in, high, power, microscopes, both, eyepieces, typically, show, the, same, image, but, with, a, stereo, microscope, slightly, different, images, are, used, to, create, a, 3, d, effect, a, camera, is, typically, used, to, capture, the, image, micrograph, the, sample, can, be, lit, in, a, variety, of, ways, transparent, objects, can, be, lit, from, below, and, solid, objects, can, be, lit, with, light, coming, through, bright, field, or, around, dark, field, the, objective, lens, polarised, light, may, be, used, to, determine, crystal, orientation, of, metallic, objects, phase, contrast, imaging, can, be, used, to, increase, image, contrast, by, highlighting, small, details, of, differing, refractive, index, a, range, of, objective, lenses, with, different, magnification, are, usually, provided, mounted, on, a, turret, allowing, them, to, be, rotated, into, place, and, providing, an, ability, to, zoom, in, the, maximum, magnification, power, of, optical, microscopes, is, typically, limited, to, around, 1000x, because, of, the, limited, resolving, power, of, visible, light, while, larger, magnifications, are, possible, no, additional, details, of, the, object, are, resolved, alternatives, to, optical, microscopy, which, do, not, use, visible, light, include, scanning, electron, microscopy, and, transmission, electron, microscopy, and, scanning, probe, microscopy, and, as, a, result, can, achieve, much, greater, magnifications, there, are, two, basic, types, of, optical, microscopes, simple, microscopes, and, compound, microscopes, a, simple, microscope, uses, the, optical, power, of, a, single, lens, or, group, of, lenses, for, magnification, a, compound, microscope, uses, a, system, of, lenses, one, set, enlarging, the, image, produced, by, another, to, achieve, a, much, higher, magnification, of, an, object, the, vast, majority, of, modern, research, microscopes, are, compound, microscopes, while, some, cheaper, commercial, digital, microscopes, are, simple, single, lens, microscopes, compound, microscopes, can, be, further, divided, into, a, variety, of, other, types, of, microscopes, which, differ, in, their, optical, configurations, cost, and, intended, purposes, a, simple, microscope, uses, a, lens, or, set, of, lenses, to, enlarge, an, object, through, angular, magnification, alone, giving, the, viewer, an, erect, enlarged, virtual, image, the, use, of, a, single, convex, lens, or, groups, of, lenses, are, found, in, simple, magnification, devices, such, as, the, magnifying, glass, loupes, and, eyepieces, for, telescopes, and, microscopes, a, compound, microscope, uses, a, lens, close, to, the, object, being, viewed, to, collect, light, called, the, objective, lens, which, focuses, a, real, image, of, the, object, inside, the, microscope, image, 1, that, image, is, then, magnified, by, a, second, lens, or, group, of, lenses, called, the, eyepiece, that, gives, the, viewer, an, enlarged, inverted, virtual, image, of, the, object, image, 2, the, use, of, a, compound, objective, eyepiece, combination, allows, for, much, higher, magnification, common, compound, microscopes, often, feature, exchangeable, objective, lenses, allowing, the, user, to, quickly, adjust, the, magnification, a, compound, microscope, also, enables, more, advanced, illumination, setups, such, as, phase, contrast, there, are, many, variants, of, the, compound, optical, microscope, design, for, specialized, purposes, some, of, these, are, physical, design, differences, allowing, specialization, for, certain, purposes, other, microscope, variants, are, designed, for, different, illumination, techniques, a, digital, microscope, is, a, microscope, equipped, with, a, digital, camera, allowing, observation, of, a, sample, via, a, computer, microscopes, can, also, be, partly, or, wholly, computer, controlled, with, various, levels, of, automation, digital, microscopy, allows, greater, analysis, of, a, microscope, image, for, example, measurements, of, distances, and, areas, and, quantitation, of, a, fluorescent, or, histological, stain, low, powered, digital, microscopes, usb, microscopes, are, also, commercially, available, these, are, essentially, webcams, with, a, high, powered, macro, lens, and, generally, do, not, use, transillumination, the, camera, is, attached, directly, to, a, computer, s, usb, port, to, show, the, images, directly, on, the, monitor, they, offer, modest, magnifications, up, to, about, 200, without, the, need, to, use, eyepieces, and, at, a, very, low, cost, high, power, illumination, is, usually, provided, by, an, led, source, or, sources, adjacent, to, the, camera, lens, digital, microscopy, with, very, low, light, levels, to, avoid, damage, to, vulnerable, biological, samples, is, available, using, sensitive, photon, counting, digital, cameras, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, a, light, source, providing, pairs, of, entangled, photons, may, minimize, the, risk, of, damage, to, the, most, light, sensitive, samples, in, this, application, of, ghost, imaging, to, photon, sparse, microscopy, the, sample, is, illuminated, with, infrared, photons, each, spatially, correlated, with, an, entangled, partner, in, the, visible, band, for, efficient, imaging, by, a, photon, counting, camera, the, earliest, microscopes, were, single, lens, magnifying, glasses, with, limited, magnification, which, date, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, widespread, use, of, lenses, in, eyeglasses, in, the, 13th, century, compound, microscopes, first, appeared, in, europe, around, 1620, including, one, demonstrated, by, cornelis, drebbel, in, london, around, 1621, and, one, exhibited, in, rome, in, 1624, the, actual, inventor, of, the, compound, microscope, is, unknown, although, many, claims, have, been, made, over, the, years, these, include, a, claim, 35, years, after, they, appeared, by, dutch, spectacle, maker, johannes, zachariassen, that, his, father, zacharias, janssen, invented, the, compound, microscope, and, or, the, telescope, as, early, as, 1590, johannes, testimony, which, some, claim, is, dubious, pushes, the, invention, date, so, far, back, that, zacharias, would, have, been, a, child, at, the, time, leading, to, speculation, that, for, johannes, claim, to, be, true, the, compound, microscope, would, have, to, have, been, invented, by, johannes, grandfather, hans, martens, another, claim, is, that, janssen, s, competitor, hans, lippershey, who, applied, for, the, first, telescope, patent, in, 1608, also, invented, the, compound, microscope, other, historians, point, to, the, dutch, innovator, cornelis, drebbel, with, his, 1621, compound, microscope, galileo, galilei, is, sometimes, cited, as, a, compound, microscope, inventor, after, 1610, he, found, that, he, could, close, focus, his, telescope, to, view, small, objects, such, as, flies, close, up, and, or, could, look, through, the, wrong, end, in, reverse, to, magnify, small, objects, the, only, drawback, was, that, his, 2, foot, long, telescope, had, to, be, extended, out, to, 6, feet, to, view, objects, that, close, after, seeing, the, compound, microscope, built, by, drebbel, exhibited, in, rome, in, 1624, galileo, built, his, own, improved, version, in, 1625, giovanni, faber, coined, the, name, microscope, for, the, compound, microscope, galileo, submitted, to, the, accademia, dei, lincei, in, 1624, galileo, had, called, it, the, occhiolino, or, little, eye, faber, coined, the, name, from, the, greek, words, micron, meaning, small, and, skopein, meaning, to, look, at, a, name, meant, to, be, analogous, with, telescope, another, word, coined, by, the, linceans, christiaan, huygens, another, dutchman, developed, a, simple, 2, lens, ocular, system, in, the, late, 17th, century, that, was, achromatically, corrected, and, therefore, a, huge, step, forward, in, microscope, development, the, huygens, ocular, is, still, being, produced, to, this, day, but, suffers, from, a, small, field, size, and, other, minor, disadvantages, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, 1632, 1724, is, credited, with, bringing, the, microscope, to, the, attention, of, biologists, even, though, simple, magnifying, lenses, were, already, being, produced, in, the, 16th, century, van, leeuwenhoek, s, home, made, microscopes, were, simple, microscopes, with, a, single, very, small, yet, strong, lens, they, were, awkward, in, use, but, enabled, van, leeuwenhoek, to, see, detailed, images, it, took, about, 150, years, of, optical, development, before, the, compound, microscope, was, able, to, provide, the, same, quality, image, as, van, leeuwenhoek, s, simple, microscopes, due, to, difficulties, in, configuring, multiple, lenses, in, the, 1850s, john, leonard, riddell, professor, of, chemistry, at, tulane, university, invented, the, first, practical, binocular, microscope, while, carrying, out, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, extensive, american, microscopic, investigations, of, cholera, while, basic, microscope, technology, and, optics, have, been, available, for, over, 400, years, it, is, much, more, recently, that, techniques, in, sample, illumination, were, developed, to, generate, the, high, quality, images, seen, today, in, august, 1893, august, k, hler, developed, k, hler, illumination, this, method, of, sample, illumination, gives, rise, to, extremely, even, lighting, and, overcomes, many, limitations, of, older, techniques, of, sample, illumination, before, development, of, k, hler, illumination, the, image, of, the, light, source, for, example, a, lightbulb, filament, was, always, visible, in, the, image, of, the, sample, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, dutch, physicist, frits, zernike, in, 1953, for, his, development, of, phase, contrast, illumination, which, allows, imaging, of, transparent, samples, by, using, interference, rather, than, absorption, of, light, extremely, transparent, samples, such, as, live, mammalian, cells, can, be, imaged, without, having, to, use, staining, techniques, just, two, years, later, in, 1955, georges, nomarski, published, the, theory, for, differential, interference, contrast, microscopy, another, interference, based, imaging, technique, modern, biological, microscopy, depends, heavily, on, the, development, of, fluorescent, probes, for, specific, structures, within, a, cell, in, contrast, to, normal, transilluminated, light, microscopy, in, fluorescence, microscopy, the, sample, is, illuminated, through, the, objective, lens, with, a, narrow, set, of, wavelengths, of, light, this, light, interacts, with, fluorophores, in, the, sample, which, then, emit, light, of, a, longer, wavelength, it, is, this, emitted, light, which, makes, up, the, image, since, the, mid, 20th, century, chemical, fluorescent, stains, such, as, dapi, which, binds, to, dna, have, been, used, to, label, specific, structures, within, the, cell, more, recent, developments, include, immunofluorescence, which, uses, fluorescently, labelled, antibodies, to, recognise, specific, proteins, within, a, sample, and, fluorescent, proteins, like, gfp, which, a, live, cell, can, express, making, it, fluorescent, all, modern, optical, microscopes, designed, for, viewing, samples, by, transmitted, light, share, the, same, basic, components, of, the, light, path, in, addition, the, vast, majority, of, microscopes, have, the, same, structural, components, numbered, below, according, to, the, image, on, the, right, the, eyepiece, or, ocular, lens, is, a, cylinder, containing, two, or, more, lenses, its, function, is, to, bring, the, image, into, focus, for, the, eye, the, eyepiece, is, inserted, into, the, top, end, of, the, body, tube, eyepieces, are, interchangeable, and, many, different, eyepieces, can, be, inserted, with, different, degrees, of, magnification, typical, magnification, values, for, eyepieces, include, 5, 10, the, most, common, 15, and, 20, in, some, high, performance, microscopes, the, optical, configuration, of, the, objective, lens, and, eyepiece, are, matched, to, give, the, best, possible, optical, performance, this, occurs, most, commonly, with, apochromatic, objectives, objective, turret, revolver, or, revolving, nose, piece, is, the, part, that, holds, the, set, of, objective, lenses, it, allows, the, user, to, switch, between, objective, lenses, at, the, lower, end, of, a, typical, compound, optical, microscope, there, are, one, or, more, objective, lenses, that, collect, light, from, the, sample, the, objective, is, usually, in, a, cylinder, housing, containing, a, glass, single, or, multi, element, compound, lens, typically, there, will, be, around, three, objective, lenses, screwed, into, a, circular, nose, piece, which, may, be, rotated, to, select, the, required, objective, lens, these, arrangements, are, designed, to, be, parfocal, which, means, that, when, one, changes, from, one, lens, to, another, on, a, microscope, the, sample, stays, in, focus, microscope, objectives, are, characterized, by, two, parameters, namely, magnification, and, numerical, aperture, the, former, typically, ranges, from, 5, to, 100, while, the, latter, ranges, from, 0, 14, to, 0, 7, corresponding, to, focal, lengths, of, about, 40, to, 2, mm, respectively, objective, lenses, with, higher, magnifications, normally, have, a, higher, numerical, aperture, and, a, shorter, depth, of, field, in, the, resulting, image, some, high, performance, objective, lenses, may, require, matched, eyepieces, to, deliver, the, best, optical, performance, some, microscopes, make, use, of, oil, immersion, objectives, or, water, immersion, objectives, for, greater, resolution, at, high, magnification, these, are, used, with, index, matching, material, such, as, immersion, oil, or, water, and, a, matched, cover, slip, between, the, objective, lens, and, the, sample, the, refractive, index, of, the, index, matching, material, is, higher, than, air, allowing, the, objective, lens, to, have, a, larger, numerical, aperture, greater, than, 1, so, that, the, light, is, transmitted, from, the, specimen, to, the, outer, face, of, the, objective, lens, with, minimal, refraction, numerical, apertures, as, high, as, 1, 6, can, be, achieved, the, larger, numerical, aperture, allows, collection, of, more, light, making, detailed, observation, of, smaller, details, possible, an, oil, immersion, lens, usually, has, a, magnification, of, 40, to, 100, adjustment, knobs, move, the, stage, up, and, down, with, separate, adjustment, for, coarse, and, fine, focusing, the, same, controls, enable, the, microscope, to, adjust, to, specimens, of, different, thickness, in, older, designs, of, microscopes, the, focus, adjustment, wheels, move, the, microscope, tube, up, or, down, relative, to, the, stand, and, had, a, fixed, stage, the, whole, of, the, optical, assembly, is, traditionally, attached, to, a, rigid, arm, which, in, turn, is, attached, to, a, robust, u, shaped, foot, to, provide, the, necessary, rigidity, the, arm, angle, may, be, adjustable, to, allow, the, viewing, angle, to, be, adjusted, the, frame, provides, a, mounting, point, for, various, microscope, controls, normally, this, will, include, controls, for, focusing, typically, a, large, knurled, wheel, to, adjust, coarse, focus, together, with, a, smaller, knurled, wheel, to, control, fine, focus, other, features, may, be, lamp, controls, and, or, controls, for, adjusting, the, condenser, the, stage, is, a, platform, below, the, objective, lens, which, supports, the, specimen, being, viewed, in, the, center, of, the, stage, is, a, hole, through, which, light, passes, to, illuminate, the, specimen, the, stage, usually, has, arms, to, hold, slides, rectangular, glass, plates, with, typical, dimensions, of, 25, 75, mm, on, which, the, specimen, is, mounted, at, magnifications, higher, than, 100, moving, a, slide, by, hand, is, not, practical, a, mechanical, stage, typical, of, medium, and, higher, priced, microscopes, allows, tiny, movements, of, the, slide, via, control, knobs, that, reposition, the, sample, slide, as, desired, if, a, microscope, did, not, originally, have, a, mechanical, stage, it, may, be, possible, to, add, one, all, stages, move, up, and, down, for, focus, with, a, mechanical, stage, slides, move, on, two, horizontal, axes, for, positioning, the, specimen, to, examine, specimen, details, focusing, starts, at, lower, magnification, in, order, to, center, the, specimen, by, the, user, on, the, stage, moving, to, a, higher, magnification, requires, the, stage, to, be, moved, higher, vertically, for, re, focus, at, the, higher, magnification, and, may, also, require, slight, horizontal, specimen, position, adjustment, horizontal, specimen, position, adjustments, are, the, reason, for, having, a, mechanical, stage, due, to, the, difficulty, in, preparing, specimens, and, mounting, them, on, slides, for, children, it, is, best, to, begin, with, prepared, slides, that, are, centered, and, focus, easily, regardless, of, the, focus, level, used, many, sources, of, light, can, be, used, at, its, simplest, daylight, is, directed, via, a, mirror, most, microscopes, however, have, their, own, adjustable, and, controllable, light, source, often, a, halogen, lamp, although, illumination, using, leds, and, lasers, are, becoming, a, more, common, provision, k, hler, illumination, is, often, provided, on, more, expensive, instruments, the, condenser, is, a, lens, designed, to, focus, light, from, the, illumination, source, onto, the, sample, the, condenser, may, also, include, other, features, such, as, a, diaphragm, and, or, filters, to, manage, the, quality, and, intensity, of, the, illumination, for, illumination, techniques, like, dark, field, phase, contrast, and, differential, interference, contrast, microscopy, additional, optical, components, must, be, precisely, aligned, in, the, light, path, the, actual, power, or, magnification, of, a, compound, optical, microscope, is, the, product, of, the, powers, of, the, eyepiece, and, the, objective, lens, for, example, a, 10x, eyepiece, magnification, and, a, 100x, objective, lens, magnification, gives, a, total, magnification, of, 1, 000, modified, environments, such, as, the, use, of, oil, or, ultraviolet, light, can, increase, the, resolution, and, allow, for, resolved, details, at, magnifications, larger, than, 1, 000x, many, techniques, are, available, which, modify, the, light, path, to, generate, an, improved, contrast, image, from, a, sample, major, techniques, for, generating, increased, contrast, from, the, sample, include, cross, polarized, light, dark, field, phase, contrast, and, differential, interference, contrast, illumination, a, recent, technique, sarfus, combines, cross, polarized, light, and, specific, contrast, enhanced, slides, for, the, visualization, of, nanometric, samples, modern, microscopes, allow, more, than, just, observation, of, transmitted, light, image, of, a, sample, there, are, many, techniques, which, can, be, used, to, extract, other, kinds, of, data, most, of, these, require, additional, equipment, in, addition, to, a, basic, compound, microscope, optical, microscopy, is, used, extensively, in, microelectronics, nanophysics, biotechnology, pharmaceutic, research, mineralogy, and, microbiology, optical, microscopy, is, used, for, medical, diagnosis, the, field, being, termed, histopathology, when, dealing, with, tissues, or, in, smear, tests, on, free, cells, or, tissue, fragments, in, industrial, use, binocular, microscopes, are, common, aside, from, applications, needing, true, depth, perception, the, use, of, dual, eyepieces, reduces, eye, strain, associated, with, long, workdays, at, a, microscopy, station, in, certain, applications, long, working, distance, or, long, focus, microscopes, are, beneficial, an, item, may, need, to, be, examined, behind, a, window, or, industrial, subjects, may, be, a, hazard, to, the, objective, such, optics, resemble, telescopes, with, close, focus, capabilities, measuring, microscopes, are, used, for, precision, measurement, there, are, two, basic, types, one, has, a, reticle, graduated, to, allow, measuring, distances, in, the, focal, plane, the, other, and, older, type, has, simple, crosshairs, and, a, micrometer, mechanism, for, moving, the, subject, relative, to, the, microscope, very, small, portable, microscopes, have, found, some, usage, in, places, where, a, laboratory, microscope, would, be, a, burden, at, very, high, magnifications, with, transmitted, light, point, objects, are, seen, as, fuzzy, discs, surrounded, by, diffraction, rings, these, are, called, airy, disks, the, resolving, power, of, a, microscope, is, taken, as, the, ability, to, distinguish, between, two, closely, spaced, airy, disks, or, in, other, words, the, ability, of, the, microscope, to, reveal, adjacent, structural, detail, as, distinct, and, separate, it, is, these, impacts, of, diffraction, that, limit, the, ability, to, resolve, fine, details, the, extent, and, magnitude, of, the, diffraction, patterns, are, affected, by, both, the, wavelength, of, light, the, refractive, materials, used, to, manufacture, the, objective, lens, and, the, numerical, aperture, na, of, the, objective, lens, there, is, therefore, a, finite, limit, beyond, which, it, is, impossible, to, resolve, separate, points, in, the, objective, field, known, as, the, diffraction, limit, assuming, that, optical, aberrations, in, the, whole, optical, set, up, are, negligible, the, resolution, d, can, be, stated, as, usually, a, wavelength, of, 550, nm, is, assumed, which, corresponds, to, green, light, with, air, as, the, external, medium, the, highest, practical, na, is, 0, 95, and, with, oil, up, to, 1, 5, in, practice, the, lowest, value, of, d, obtainable, with, conventional, lenses, is, about, 200, nm, a, new, type, of, lens, using, multiple, scattering, of, light, allowed, to, improve, the, resolution, to, below, 100, nm, multiple, techniques, are, available, for, reaching, resolutions, higher, than, the, transmitted, light, limit, described, above, holographic, techniques, as, described, by, courjon, and, bulabois, in, 1979, are, also, capable, of, breaking, this, resolution, limit, although, resolution, was, restricted, in, their, experimental, analysis, using, fluorescent, samples, more, techniques, are, available, examples, include, vertico, smi, near, field, scanning, optical, microscopy, which, uses, evanescent, waves, and, stimulated, emission, depletion, in, 2005, a, microscope, capable, of, detecting, a, single, molecule, was, described, as, a, teaching, tool, despite, significant, progress, in, the, last, decade, techniques, for, surpassing, the, diffraction, limit, remain, limited, and, specialized, while, most, techniques, focus, on, increases, in, lateral, resolution, there, are, also, some, techniques, which, aim, to, allow, analysis, of, extremely, thin, samples, for, example, sarfus, methods, place, the, thin, sample, on, a, contrast, enhancing, surface, and, thereby, allows, to, directly, visualize, films, as, thin, as, 0, 3, nanometers, on, 8, october, 2014, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, was, awarded, to, eric, betzig, william, moerner, and, stefan, hell, for, the, development, of, super, resolved, fluorescence, microscopy, smi, spatially, modulated, illumination, microscopy, is, a, light, optical, process, of, the, so, called, point, spread, function, psf, engineering, these, are, processes, which, modify, the, psf, of, a, microscope, in, a, suitable, manner, to, either, increase, the, optical, resolution, to, maximize, the, precision, of, distance, measurements, of, fluorescent, objects, that, are, small, relative, to, the, wavelength, of, the, illuminating, light, or, to, extract, other, structural, parameters, in, the, nanometer, range, spdm, spectral, precision, distance, microscopy, the, basic, localization, microscopy, technology, is, a, light, optical, process, of, fluorescence, microscopy, which, allows, position, distance, and, angle, measurements, on, optically, isolated, particles, e, g, molecules, well, below, the, theoretical, limit, of, resolution, for, light, microscopy, optically, isolated, means, that, at, a, given, point, in, time, only, a, single, particle, molecule, within, a, region, of, a, size, determined, by, conventional, optical, resolution, typically, approx, 200, 250, nm, diameter, is, being, registered, this, is, possible, when, molecules, within, such, a, region, all, carry, different, spectral, markers, e, g, different, colors, or, other, usable, differences, in, the, light, emission, of, different, particles, many, standard, fluorescent, dyes, like, gfp, alexa, dyes, atto, dyes, cy2, cy3, and, fluorescein, molecules, can, be, used, for, localization, microscopy, provided, certain, photo, physical, conditions, are, present, using, this, so, called, spdmphymod, physically, modifiable, fluorophores, technology, a, single, laser, wavelength, of, suitable, intensity, is, sufficient, for, nanoimaging, 3d, super, resolution, microscopy, with, standard, fluorescent, dyes, can, be, achieved, by, combination, of, localization, microscopy, for, standard, fluorescent, dyes, spdmphymod, and, structured, illumination, smi, stimulated, emission, depletion, is, a, simple, example, of, how, higher, resolution, surpassing, the, diffraction, limit, is, possible, but, it, has, major, limitations, sted, is, a, fluorescence, microscopy, technique, which, uses, a, combination, of, light, pulses, to, induce, fluorescence, in, a, small, sub, population, of, fluorescent, molecules, in, a, sample, each, molecule, produces, a, diffraction, limited, spot, of, light, in, the, image, and, the, centre, of, each, of, these, spots, corresponds, to, the, location, of, the, molecule, as, the, number, of, fluorescing, molecules, is, low, the, spots, of, light, are, unlikely, to, overlap, and, therefore, can, be, placed, accurately, this, process, is, then, repeated, many, times, to, generate, the, image, stefan, hell, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, biophysical, chemistry, was, awarded, the, 10th, german, future, prize, in, 2006, and, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, in, 2014, for, his, development, of, the, sted, microscope, and, associated, methodologies, in, order, to, overcome, the, limitations, set, by, the, diffraction, limit, of, visible, light, other, microscopes, have, been, designed, which, use, other, waves, it, is, important, to, note, that, higher, frequency, waves, have, limited, interaction, with, matter, for, example, soft, tissues, are, relatively, transparent, to, x, rays, resulting, in, distinct, sources, of, contrast, and, different, target, applications, the, use, of, electrons, and, x, rays, in, place, of, light, allows, much, higher, resolution, the, wavelength, of, the, radiation, is, shorter, so, the, diffraction, limit, is, lower, to, make, the, short, wavelength, probe, non, destructive, the, atomic, beam, imaging, system, atomic, nanoscope, has, been, proposed, and, widely, discussed, in, the, literature, but, it, is, not, yet, competitive, with, conventional, imaging, systems, stm, and, afm, are, scanning, probe, techniques, using, a, small, probe, which, is, scanned, over, the, sample, surface, resolution, in, these, cases, is, limited, by, the, size, of, the, probe, micromachining, techniques, can, produce, probes, with, tip, radii, of, 5, 10, nm, additionally, methods, such, as, electron, or, x, ray, microscopy, use, a, vacuum, or, partial, vacuum, which, limits, their, use, for, live, and, biological, samples, with, the, exception, of, an, environmental, scanning, electron, microscope, the, specimen, chambers, needed, for, all, such, instruments, also, limits, sample, size, and, sample, manipulation, is, more, difficult, color, cannot, be, seen, in, images, made, by, these, methods, so, some, information, is, lost, they, are, however, essential, when, investigating, molecular, or, atomic, effects, such, as, age, hardening, in, aluminium, alloys, or, the, microstructure, of, polymers
