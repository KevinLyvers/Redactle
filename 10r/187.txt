gasoline, or, petrol, is, a, petrochemical, product, characterized, as, a, transparent, yellowish, and, flammable, liquid, normally, used, as, a, fuel, for, spark, ignited, internal, combustion, engines, when, formulated, as, a, fuel, for, engines, gasoline, is, chemically, composed, of, organic, compounds, derived, from, the, fractional, distillation, of, petroleum, and, later, chemically, enhanced, with, gasoline, additives, it, is, a, high, volume, profitable, product, produced, in, crude, oil, refineries, the, fuel, characteristics, of, a, particular, gasoline, blend, which, will, resist, igniting, too, early, are, measured, as, the, octane, rating, of, the, fuel, blend, gasoline, blends, with, stable, octane, ratings, are, produced, in, several, fuel, grades, for, different, types, of, motors, a, low, octane, rated, fuel, may, cause, engine, knocking, and, reduced, efficiency, in, reciprocating, engines, tetraethyl, lead, and, other, lead, compounds, were, once, widely, used, as, additives, to, increase, the, octane, rating, but, are, not, used, in, modern, automotive, gasoline, due, to, the, extreme, health, hazard, except, in, aviation, off, road, motor, vehicles, and, racing, car, motors, the, additive, continued, to, be, used, in, low, income, countries, for, decades, after, others, had, phased, it, out, leading, the, un, environment, programme, unep, to, launch, a, campaign, to, eliminate, its, use, this, campaign, finally, led, to, algeria, being, the, last, country, to, stop, its, use, in, 2021, gasoline, can, be, released, into, the, earth, s, environment, as, an, uncombusted, liquid, fuel, as, a, flammable, liquid, or, as, a, vapor, by, way, of, leakages, occurring, during, its, production, handling, transport, and, delivery, gasoline, contains, known, carcinogens, gasoline, is, often, used, as, a, recreational, inhalant, and, can, be, harmful, or, fatal, when, used, in, such, a, manner, when, burned, one, liter, 0, 26, u, s, gal, of, gasoline, emits, about, 2, 3, kilograms, 5, 1, lb, of, co, 2, a, greenhouse, gas, contributing, to, human, caused, climate, change, oil, products, including, gasoline, were, responsible, for, about, 32, of, co, 2, emissions, worldwide, in, 2021, on, average, u, s, petroleum, refineries, produce, about, 19, to, 20, gallons, of, gasoline, 11, to, 13, gallons, of, distillate, fuel, diesel, fuel, and, 3, to, 4, gallons, of, jet, fuel, from, each, 42, gallon, 152, liters, barrel, of, crude, oil, the, product, ratio, depends, upon, the, processing, in, an, oil, refinery, and, the, crude, oil, assay, see, etymology, the, american, english, word, gasoline, denotes, fuel, for, automobiles, which, common, usage, shortened, to, the, terms, gas, or, rarely, motor, gas, and, mogas, thus, differentiating, it, from, avgas, aviation, gasoline, which, is, fuel, for, airplanes, english, dictionaries, including, the, oxford, english, dictionary, show, that, the, term, gasoline, originates, from, gas, plus, the, chemical, suffixes, ole, and, ine, however, a, blog, post, at, the, defunct, website, oxford, dictionaries, alternatively, proposes, that, the, word, may, have, originated, from, the, surname, of, british, businessman, john, cassell, who, supposedly, first, marketed, the, substance, in, place, of, the, word, gasoline, most, commonwealth, countries, except, canada, use, the, term, petrol, and, north, americans, more, often, use, gas, in, common, parlance, hence, the, prevalence, of, the, usage, gas, station, in, the, united, states, coined, from, medieval, latin, the, word, petroleum, l, petra, rock, oleum, oil, initially, denoted, types, of, mineral, oil, derived, from, rocks, and, stones, in, britain, petrol, was, a, refined, mineral, oil, product, marketed, as, a, solvent, from, the, 1870s, by, the, british, wholesaler, carless, refining, and, marketing, ltd, when, petrol, found, a, later, use, as, a, motor, fuel, frederick, simms, an, associate, of, gottlieb, daimler, suggested, to, john, leonard, owner, of, carless, that, they, trademark, the, word, and, uppercase, spelling, petrol, the, trademark, application, was, refused, because, petrol, had, already, become, an, established, general, term, for, motor, fuel, due, to, the, firm, s, age, carless, retained, the, legal, rights, to, the, term, and, to, the, uppercase, spelling, of, petrol, as, the, name, of, a, petrochemical, product, british, refiners, originally, used, motor, spirit, as, a, generic, name, for, the, automotive, fuel, and, aviation, spirit, for, aviation, gasoline, when, carless, was, denied, a, trademark, on, petrol, in, the, 1930s, its, competitors, switched, to, the, more, popular, name, petrol, however, motor, spirit, had, already, made, its, way, into, laws, and, regulations, so, the, term, remains, in, use, as, a, formal, name, for, petrol, the, term, is, used, most, widely, in, nigeria, where, the, largest, petroleum, companies, call, their, product, premium, motor, spirit, although, petrol, has, made, inroads, into, nigerian, english, premium, motor, spirit, remains, the, formal, name, that, is, used, in, scientific, publications, government, reports, and, newspapers, some, other, languages, use, variants, of, gasoline, gasolina, is, used, in, spanish, and, portuguese, and, gasorin, is, used, in, japanese, in, other, languages, the, name, of, the, product, is, derived, from, the, hydrocarbon, compound, benzene, or, more, precisely, from, the, class, of, products, called, petroleum, benzine, such, as, benzin, in, german, or, benzina, in, italian, but, in, argentina, uruguay, and, paraguay, the, colloquial, name, nafta, is, derived, from, that, of, the, chemical, naphtha, some, languages, like, french, and, italian, use, the, respective, words, for, gasoline, to, instead, indicate, diesel, fuel, the, first, internal, combustion, engines, suitable, for, use, in, transportation, applications, so, called, otto, engines, were, developed, in, germany, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, the, fuel, for, these, early, engines, was, a, relatively, volatile, hydrocarbon, obtained, from, coal, gas, with, a, boiling, point, near, 85, c, 185, f, n, octane, boils, at, 125, 62, c, 258, 12, f, it, was, well, suited, for, early, carburetors, evaporators, the, development, of, a, spray, nozzle, carburetor, enabled, the, use, of, less, volatile, fuels, further, improvements, in, engine, efficiency, were, attempted, at, higher, compression, ratios, but, early, attempts, were, blocked, by, the, premature, explosion, of, fuel, known, as, knocking, in, 1891, the, shukhov, cracking, process, became, the, world, s, first, commercial, method, to, break, down, heavier, hydrocarbons, in, crude, oil, to, increase, the, percentage, of, lighter, products, compared, to, simple, distillation, the, evolution, of, gasoline, followed, the, evolution, of, oil, as, the, dominant, source, of, energy, in, the, industrializing, world, before, world, war, i, britain, was, the, world, s, greatest, industrial, power, and, depended, on, its, navy, to, protect, the, shipping, of, raw, materials, from, its, colonies, germany, was, also, industrializing, and, like, britain, lacked, many, natural, resources, which, had, to, be, shipped, to, the, home, country, by, the, 1890s, germany, began, to, pursue, a, policy, of, global, prominence, and, began, building, a, navy, to, compete, with, britain, s, coal, was, the, fuel, that, powered, their, navies, though, both, britain, and, germany, had, natural, coal, reserves, new, developments, in, oil, as, a, fuel, for, ships, changed, the, situation, coal, powered, ships, were, a, tactical, weakness, because, the, process, of, loading, coal, was, extremely, slow, and, dirty, and, left, the, ship, completely, vulnerable, to, attack, and, unreliable, supplies, of, coal, at, international, ports, made, long, distance, voyages, impractical, the, advantages, of, petroleum, oil, soon, found, the, navies, of, the, world, converting, to, oil, but, britain, and, germany, had, very, few, domestic, oil, reserves, britain, eventually, solved, its, naval, oil, dependence, by, securing, oil, from, royal, dutch, shell, and, the, anglo, persian, oil, company, and, this, determined, from, where, and, of, what, quality, its, gasoline, would, come, during, the, early, period, of, gasoline, engine, development, aircraft, were, forced, to, use, motor, vehicle, gasoline, since, aviation, gasoline, did, not, yet, exist, these, early, fuels, were, termed, straight, run, gasolines, and, were, byproducts, from, the, distillation, of, a, single, crude, oil, to, produce, kerosene, which, was, the, principal, product, sought, for, burning, in, kerosene, lamps, gasoline, production, would, not, surpass, kerosene, production, until, 1916, the, earliest, straight, run, gasolines, were, the, result, of, distilling, eastern, crude, oils, and, there, was, no, mixing, of, distillates, from, different, crudes, the, composition, of, these, early, fuels, was, unknown, and, the, quality, varied, greatly, as, crude, oils, from, different, oil, fields, emerged, in, different, mixtures, of, hydrocarbons, in, different, ratios, the, engine, effects, produced, by, abnormal, combustion, engine, knocking, and, pre, ignition, due, to, inferior, fuels, had, not, yet, been, identified, and, as, a, result, there, was, no, rating, of, gasoline, in, terms, of, its, resistance, to, abnormal, combustion, the, general, specification, by, which, early, gasolines, were, measured, was, that, of, specific, gravity, via, the, baum, scale, and, later, the, volatility, tendency, to, vaporize, specified, in, terms, of, boiling, points, which, became, the, primary, focuses, for, gasoline, producers, these, early, eastern, crude, oil, gasolines, had, relatively, high, baum, test, results, 65, to, 80, degrees, baum, and, were, called, pennsylvania, high, test, or, simply, high, test, gasolines, these, were, often, used, in, aircraft, engines, by, 1910, increased, automobile, production, and, the, resultant, increase, in, gasoline, consumption, produced, a, greater, demand, for, gasoline, also, the, growing, electrification, of, lighting, produced, a, drop, in, kerosene, demand, creating, a, supply, problem, it, appeared, that, the, burgeoning, oil, industry, would, be, trapped, into, over, producing, kerosene, and, under, producing, gasoline, since, simple, distillation, could, not, alter, the, ratio, of, the, two, products, from, any, given, crude, the, solution, appeared, in, 1911, when, the, development, of, the, burton, process, allowed, thermal, cracking, of, crude, oils, which, increased, the, percent, yield, of, gasoline, from, the, heavier, hydrocarbons, this, was, combined, with, the, expansion, of, foreign, markets, for, the, export, of, surplus, kerosene, which, domestic, markets, no, longer, needed, these, new, thermally, cracked, gasolines, were, believed, to, have, no, harmful, effects, and, would, be, added, to, straight, run, gasolines, there, also, was, the, practice, of, mixing, heavy, and, light, distillates, to, achieve, the, desired, baum, reading, and, collectively, these, were, called, blended, gasolines, gradually, volatility, gained, favor, over, the, baum, test, though, both, continued, to, be, used, in, combination, to, specify, a, gasoline, as, late, as, june, 1917, standard, oil, the, largest, refiner, of, crude, oil, in, the, united, states, at, the, time, stated, that, the, most, important, property, of, a, gasoline, was, its, volatility, it, is, estimated, that, the, rating, equivalent, of, these, straight, run, gasolines, varied, from, 40, to, 60, octane, and, that, the, high, test, sometimes, referred, to, as, fighting, grade, probably, averaged, 50, to, 65, octane, prior, to, the, united, states, entry, into, world, war, i, the, european, allies, used, fuels, derived, from, crude, oils, from, borneo, java, and, sumatra, which, gave, satisfactory, performance, in, their, military, aircraft, when, the, u, s, entered, the, war, in, april, 1917, the, u, s, became, the, principal, supplier, of, aviation, gasoline, to, the, allies, and, a, decrease, in, engine, performance, was, noted, soon, it, was, realized, that, motor, vehicle, fuels, were, unsatisfactory, for, aviation, and, after, the, loss, of, several, combat, aircraft, attention, turned, to, the, quality, of, the, gasolines, being, used, later, flight, tests, conducted, in, 1937, showed, that, an, octane, reduction, of, 13, points, from, 100, down, to, 87, octane, decreased, engine, performance, by, 20, percent, and, increased, take, off, distance, by, 45, percent, if, abnormal, combustion, were, to, occur, the, engine, could, lose, enough, power, to, make, getting, airborne, impossible, and, a, take, off, roll, became, a, threat, to, the, pilot, and, aircraft, on, 2, august, 1917, the, u, s, bureau, of, mines, arranged, to, study, fuels, for, aircraft, in, cooperation, with, the, aviation, section, of, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, and, a, general, survey, concluded, that, no, reliable, data, existed, for, the, proper, fuels, for, aircraft, as, a, result, flight, tests, began, at, langley, mccook, and, wright, fields, to, determine, how, different, gasolines, performed, under, different, conditions, these, tests, showed, that, in, certain, aircraft, motor, vehicle, gasolines, performed, as, well, as, high, test, but, in, other, types, resulted, in, hot, running, engines, it, was, also, found, that, gasolines, from, aromatic, and, naphthenic, base, crude, oils, from, california, south, texas, and, venezuela, resulted, in, smooth, running, engines, these, tests, resulted, in, the, first, government, specifications, for, motor, gasolines, aviation, gasolines, used, the, same, specifications, as, motor, gasolines, in, late, 1917, engine, designers, knew, that, according, to, the, otto, cycle, power, and, efficiency, increased, with, compression, ratio, but, experience, with, early, gasolines, during, world, war, i, showed, that, higher, compression, ratios, increased, the, risk, of, abnormal, combustion, producing, lower, power, lower, efficiency, hot, running, engines, and, potentially, severe, engine, damage, to, compensate, for, these, poor, fuels, early, engines, used, low, compression, ratios, which, required, relatively, large, heavy, engines, with, limited, power, and, efficiency, the, wright, brothers, first, gasoline, engine, used, a, compression, ratio, as, low, as, 4, 7, to, 1, developed, only, 8, 9, kilowatts, 12, hp, from, 3, 290, cubic, centimeters, 201, cu, in, and, weighed, 82, kilograms, 180, lb, this, was, a, major, concern, for, aircraft, designers, and, the, needs, of, the, aviation, industry, provoked, the, search, for, fuels, that, could, be, used, in, higher, compression, engines, between, 1917, and, 1919, the, amount, of, thermally, cracked, gasoline, utilized, almost, doubled, also, the, use, of, natural, gasoline, increased, greatly, during, this, period, many, u, s, states, established, specifications, for, motor, gasoline, but, none, of, these, agreed, and, they, were, unsatisfactory, from, one, standpoint, or, another, larger, oil, refiners, began, to, specify, unsaturated, material, percentage, thermally, cracked, products, caused, gumming, in, both, use, and, storage, while, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, are, more, reactive, and, tend, to, combine, with, impurities, leading, to, gumming, in, 1922, the, u, s, government, published, the, first, specifications, for, aviation, gasolines, two, grades, were, designated, as, fighting, and, domestic, and, were, governed, by, boiling, points, color, sulfur, content, and, a, gum, formation, test, along, with, one, motor, grade, for, automobiles, the, gum, test, essentially, eliminated, thermally, cracked, gasoline, from, aviation, usage, and, thus, aviation, gasolines, reverted, to, fractionating, straight, run, naphthas, or, blending, straight, run, and, highly, treated, thermally, cracked, naphthas, this, situation, persisted, until, 1929, the, automobile, industry, reacted, to, the, increase, in, thermally, cracked, gasoline, with, alarm, thermal, cracking, produced, large, amounts, of, both, mono, and, diolefins, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, which, increased, the, risk, of, gumming, also, the, volatility, was, decreasing, to, the, point, that, fuel, did, not, vaporize, and, was, sticking, to, spark, plugs, and, fouling, them, creating, hard, starting, and, rough, running, in, winter, and, sticking, to, cylinder, walls, bypassing, the, pistons, and, rings, and, going, into, the, crankcase, oil, one, journal, stated, on, a, multi, cylinder, engine, in, a, high, priced, car, we, are, diluting, the, oil, in, the, crankcase, as, much, as, 40, percent, in, a, 200, mile, run, as, the, analysis, of, the, oil, in, the, oil, pan, shows, being, very, unhappy, with, the, consequent, reduction, in, overall, gasoline, quality, automobile, manufacturers, suggested, imposing, a, quality, standard, on, the, oil, suppliers, the, oil, industry, in, turn, accused, the, automakers, of, not, doing, enough, to, improve, vehicle, economy, and, the, dispute, became, known, within, the, two, industries, as, the, fuel, problem, animosity, grew, between, the, industries, each, accusing, the, other, of, not, doing, anything, to, resolve, matters, and, their, relationship, deteriorated, the, situation, was, only, resolved, when, the, american, petroleum, institute, api, initiated, a, conference, to, address, the, fuel, problem, and, a, cooperative, fuel, research, cfr, committee, was, established, in, 1920, to, oversee, joint, investigative, programs, and, solutions, apart, from, representatives, of, the, two, industries, the, society, of, automotive, engineers, sae, also, played, an, instrumental, role, with, the, u, s, bureau, of, standards, being, chosen, as, an, impartial, research, organization, to, carry, out, many, of, the, studies, initially, all, the, programs, were, related, to, volatility, and, fuel, consumption, ease, of, starting, crankcase, oil, dilution, and, acceleration, with, the, increased, use, of, thermally, cracked, gasolines, came, an, increased, concern, regarding, its, effects, on, abnormal, combustion, and, this, led, to, research, for, antiknock, additives, in, the, late, 1910s, researchers, such, as, a, h, gibson, harry, ricardo, thomas, midgley, jr, and, thomas, boyd, began, to, investigate, abnormal, combustion, beginning, in, 1916, charles, f, kettering, of, general, motors, began, investigating, additives, based, on, two, paths, the, high, percentage, solution, where, large, quantities, of, ethanol, were, added, and, the, low, percentage, solution, where, only, 0, 53, 1, 1, g, l, or, 0, 071, 0, 147, oz, u, s, gal, were, needed, the, low, percentage, solution, ultimately, led, to, the, discovery, of, tetraethyllead, tel, in, december, 1921, a, product, of, the, research, of, midgley, and, boyd, and, the, defining, component, of, leaded, gasoline, this, innovation, started, a, cycle, of, improvements, in, fuel, efficiency, that, coincided, with, the, large, scale, development, of, oil, refining, to, provide, more, products, in, the, boiling, range, of, gasoline, ethanol, could, not, be, patented, but, tel, could, so, kettering, secured, a, patent, for, tel, and, began, promoting, it, instead, of, other, options, the, dangers, of, compounds, containing, lead, were, well, established, by, then, and, kettering, was, directly, warned, by, robert, wilson, of, mit, reid, hunt, of, harvard, yandell, henderson, of, yale, and, erik, krause, of, the, university, of, potsdam, in, germany, about, its, use, krause, had, worked, on, tetraethyllead, for, many, years, and, called, it, a, creeping, and, malicious, poison, that, had, killed, a, member, of, his, dissertation, committee, on, 27, october, 1924, newspaper, articles, around, the, nation, told, of, the, workers, at, the, standard, oil, refinery, near, elizabeth, new, jersey, who, were, producing, tel, and, were, suffering, from, lead, poisoning, by, 30, october, the, death, toll, had, reached, five, in, november, the, new, jersey, labor, commission, closed, the, bayway, refinery, and, a, grand, jury, investigation, was, started, which, had, resulted, in, no, charges, by, february, 1925, leaded, gasoline, sales, were, banned, in, new, york, city, philadelphia, and, new, jersey, general, motors, dupont, and, standard, oil, who, were, partners, in, ethyl, corporation, the, company, created, to, produce, tel, began, to, argue, that, there, were, no, alternatives, to, leaded, gasoline, that, would, maintain, fuel, efficiency, and, still, prevent, engine, knocking, after, several, industry, funded, flawed, studies, reported, that, tel, treated, gasoline, was, not, a, public, health, issue, the, controversy, subsided, in, the, five, years, prior, to, 1929, a, great, amount, of, experimentation, was, conducted, on, different, testing, methods, for, determining, fuel, resistance, to, abnormal, combustion, it, appeared, engine, knocking, was, dependent, on, a, wide, variety, of, parameters, including, compression, ignition, timing, cylinder, temperature, air, cooled, or, water, cooled, engines, chamber, shapes, intake, temperatures, lean, or, rich, mixtures, and, others, this, led, to, a, confusing, variety, of, test, engines, that, gave, conflicting, results, and, no, standard, rating, scale, existed, by, 1929, it, was, recognized, by, most, aviation, gasoline, manufacturers, and, users, that, some, kind, of, antiknock, rating, must, be, included, in, government, specifications, in, 1929, the, octane, rating, scale, was, adopted, and, in, 1930, the, first, octane, specification, for, aviation, fuels, was, established, in, the, same, year, the, u, s, army, air, force, specified, fuels, rated, at, 87, octane, for, its, aircraft, as, a, result, of, studies, it, had, conducted, during, this, period, research, showed, that, hydrocarbon, structure, was, extremely, important, to, the, antiknocking, properties, of, fuel, straight, chain, paraffins, in, the, boiling, range, of, gasoline, had, low, antiknock, qualities, while, ring, shaped, molecules, such, as, aromatic, hydrocarbons, for, example, benzene, had, higher, resistance, to, knocking, this, development, led, to, the, search, for, processes, that, would, produce, more, of, these, compounds, from, crude, oils, than, achieved, under, straight, distillation, or, thermal, cracking, research, by, the, major, refiners, led, to, the, development, of, processes, involving, isomerization, of, cheap, and, abundant, butane, to, isobutane, and, alkylation, to, join, isobutane, and, butylenes, to, form, isomers, of, octane, such, as, isooctane, which, became, an, important, component, in, aviation, fuel, blending, to, further, complicate, the, situation, as, engine, performance, increased, the, altitude, that, aircraft, could, reach, also, increased, which, resulted, in, concerns, about, the, fuel, freezing, the, average, temperature, decrease, is, 3, 6, f, 2, 0, c, per, 300, meter, 1, 000, ft, increase, in, altitude, and, at, 12, 000, meters, 40, 000, ft, the, temperature, can, approach, 57, c, 70, f, additives, like, benzene, with, a, freezing, point, of, 6, c, 42, f, would, freeze, in, the, gasoline, and, plug, fuel, lines, substituted, aromatics, such, as, toluene, xylene, and, cumene, combined, with, limited, benzene, solved, the, problem, by, 1935, there, were, seven, different, aviation, grades, based, on, octane, rating, two, army, grades, four, navy, grades, and, three, commercial, grades, including, the, introduction, of, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, by, 1937, the, army, established, 100, octane, as, the, standard, fuel, for, combat, aircraft, and, to, add, to, the, confusion, the, government, now, recognized, 14, different, grades, in, addition, to, 11, others, in, foreign, countries, with, some, companies, required, to, stock, 14, grades, of, aviation, fuel, none, of, which, could, be, interchanged, the, effect, on, the, refiners, was, negative, the, refining, industry, could, not, concentrate, on, large, capacity, conversion, processes, for, so, many, different, grades, and, a, solution, had, to, be, found, by, 1941, principally, through, the, efforts, of, the, cooperative, fuel, research, committee, the, number, of, grades, for, aviation, fuels, was, reduced, to, three, 73, 91, and, 100, octane, the, development, of, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, on, an, economic, scale, was, due, in, part, to, jimmy, doolittle, who, had, become, aviation, manager, of, shell, oil, company, he, convinced, shell, to, invest, in, refining, capacity, to, produce, 100, octane, on, a, scale, that, nobody, needed, since, no, aircraft, existed, that, required, a, fuel, that, nobody, made, some, fellow, employees, would, call, his, effort, doolittle, s, million, dollar, blunder, but, time, would, prove, doolittle, correct, before, this, the, army, had, considered, 100, octane, tests, using, pure, octane, but, at, 6, 6, per, liter, 25, u, s, gal, the, price, prevented, this, from, happening, in, 1929, stanavo, specification, board, inc, was, organized, by, the, standard, oil, companies, of, california, indiana, and, new, jersey, to, improve, aviation, fuels, and, oils, and, by, 1935, had, placed, their, first, 100, octane, fuel, on, the, market, stanavo, ethyl, gasoline, 100, it, was, used, by, the, army, engine, manufacturers, and, airlines, for, testing, and, for, air, racing, and, record, flights, by, 1936, tests, at, wright, field, using, the, new, cheaper, alternatives, to, pure, octane, proved, the, value, of, 100, octane, fuel, and, both, shell, and, standard, oil, would, win, the, contract, to, supply, test, quantities, for, the, army, by, 1938, the, price, was, down, to, 0, 046, per, liter, 0, 175, u, s, gal, only, 0, 0066, 0, 025, more, than, 87, octane, fuel, by, the, end, of, wwii, the, price, would, be, down, to, 0, 042, per, liter, 0, 16, u, s, gal, in, 1937, eugene, houdry, developed, the, houdry, process, of, catalytic, cracking, which, produced, a, high, octane, base, stock, of, gasoline, which, was, superior, to, the, thermally, cracked, product, since, it, did, not, contain, the, high, concentration, of, olefins, in, 1940, there, were, only, 14, houdry, units, in, operation, in, the, u, s, by, 1943, this, had, increased, to, 77, either, of, the, houdry, process, or, of, the, thermofor, catalytic, or, fluid, catalyst, type, the, search, for, fuels, with, octane, ratings, above, 100, led, to, the, extension, of, the, scale, by, comparing, power, output, a, fuel, designated, grade, 130, would, produce, 130, percent, as, much, power, in, an, engine, as, it, would, running, on, pure, iso, octane, during, wwii, fuels, above, 100, octane, were, given, two, ratings, a, rich, and, a, lean, mixture, and, these, would, be, called, performance, numbers, pn, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, would, be, referred, to, as, 130, 100, grade, oil, and, its, byproducts, especially, high, octane, aviation, gasoline, would, prove, to, be, a, driving, concern, for, how, germany, conducted, the, war, as, a, result, of, the, lessons, of, world, war, i, germany, had, stockpiled, oil, and, gasoline, for, its, blitzkrieg, offensive, and, had, annexed, austria, adding, 18, 000, barrels, 2, 900, m, 3, 100, 000, cu, ft, per, day, of, oil, production, but, this, was, not, sufficient, to, sustain, the, planned, conquest, of, europe, because, captured, supplies, and, oil, fields, would, be, necessary, to, fuel, the, campaign, the, german, high, command, created, a, special, squad, of, oilfield, experts, drawn, from, the, ranks, of, domestic, oil, industries, they, were, sent, in, to, put, out, oilfield, fires, and, get, production, going, again, as, soon, as, possible, but, capturing, oilfields, remained, an, obstacle, throughout, the, war, during, the, invasion, of, poland, german, estimates, of, gasoline, consumption, turned, out, to, be, vastly, too, low, heinz, guderian, and, his, panzer, divisions, consumed, nearly, 2, 4, liters, per, kilometer, 1, u, s, gal, mi, of, gasoline, on, the, drive, to, vienna, when, they, were, engaged, in, combat, across, open, country, gasoline, consumption, almost, doubled, on, the, second, day, of, battle, a, unit, of, the, xix, corps, was, forced, to, halt, when, it, ran, out, of, gasoline, one, of, the, major, objectives, of, the, polish, invasion, was, their, oil, fields, but, the, soviets, invaded, and, captured, 70, percent, of, the, polish, production, before, the, germans, could, reach, it, through, the, german, soviet, commercial, agreement, 1940, stalin, agreed, in, vague, terms, to, supply, germany, with, additional, oil, equal, to, that, produced, by, now, soviet, occupied, polish, oilfields, at, drohobych, and, boryslav, in, exchange, for, hard, coal, and, steel, tubing, even, after, the, nazis, conquered, the, vast, territories, of, europe, this, did, not, help, the, gasoline, shortage, this, area, had, never, been, self, sufficient, in, oil, before, the, war, in, 1938, the, area, that, would, become, nazi, occupied, produced, 575, 000, barrels, 91, 400, m, 3, 3, 230, 000, cu, ft, per, day, in, 1940, total, production, under, german, control, amounted, to, only, 234, 550, barrels, 37, 290, m, 3, 1, 316, 900, cu, ft, by, early, 1941, and, the, depletion, of, german, gasoline, reserves, adolf, hitler, saw, the, invasion, of, russia, to, seize, the, polish, oil, fields, and, the, russian, oil, in, the, caucasus, as, the, solution, to, the, german, gasoline, shortage, as, early, as, july, 1941, following, the, 22, june, start, of, operation, barbarossa, certain, luftwaffe, squadrons, were, forced, to, curtail, ground, support, missions, due, to, shortages, of, aviation, gasoline, on, 9, october, the, german, quartermaster, general, estimated, that, army, vehicles, were, 24, 000, barrels, 3, 800, m, 3, 130, 000, cu, ft, short, of, gasoline, requirements, virtually, all, of, germany, s, aviation, gasoline, came, from, synthetic, oil, plants, that, hydrogenated, coals, and, coal, tars, these, processes, had, been, developed, during, the, 1930s, as, an, effort, to, achieve, fuel, independence, there, were, two, grades, of, aviation, gasoline, produced, in, volume, in, germany, the, b, 4, or, blue, grade, and, the, c, 3, or, green, grade, which, accounted, for, about, two, thirds, of, all, production, b, 4, was, equivalent, to, 89, octane, and, the, c, 3, was, roughly, equal, to, the, u, s, 100, octane, though, lean, mixture, was, rated, around, 95, octane, and, was, poorer, than, the, u, s, version, maximum, output, achieved, in, 1943, reached, 52, 200, barrels, 8, 300, m, 3, 293, 000, cu, ft, a, day, before, the, allies, decided, to, target, the, synthetic, fuel, plants, through, captured, enemy, aircraft, and, analysis, of, the, gasoline, found, in, them, both, the, allies, and, the, axis, powers, were, aware, of, the, quality, of, the, aviation, gasoline, being, produced, and, this, prompted, an, octane, race, to, achieve, the, advantage, in, aircraft, performance, later, in, the, war, the, c, 3, grade, was, improved, to, where, it, was, equivalent, to, the, u, s, 150, grade, rich, mixture, rating, japan, like, germany, had, almost, no, domestic, oil, supply, and, by, the, late, 1930s, produced, only, seven, percent, of, its, own, oil, while, importing, the, rest, 80, percent, from, the, u, s, as, japanese, aggression, grew, in, china, uss, panay, incident, and, news, reached, the, american, public, of, japanese, bombing, of, civilian, centers, especially, the, bombing, of, chungking, public, opinion, began, to, support, a, u, s, embargo, a, gallup, poll, in, june, 1939, found, that, 72, percent, of, the, american, public, supported, an, embargo, on, war, materials, to, japan, this, increased, tensions, between, the, u, s, and, japan, and, it, led, to, the, u, s, placing, restrictions, on, exports, in, july, 1940, the, u, s, issued, a, proclamation, that, banned, the, export, of, 87, octane, or, higher, aviation, gasoline, to, japan, this, ban, did, not, hinder, the, japanese, as, their, aircraft, could, operate, with, fuels, below, 87, octane, and, if, needed, they, could, add, tel, to, increase, the, octane, as, it, turned, out, japan, bought, 550, percent, more, sub, 87, octane, aviation, gasoline, in, the, five, months, after, the, july, 1940, ban, on, higher, octane, sales, the, possibility, of, a, complete, ban, of, gasoline, from, america, created, friction, in, the, japanese, government, as, to, what, action, to, take, to, secure, more, supplies, from, the, dutch, east, indies, and, demanded, greater, oil, exports, from, the, exiled, dutch, government, after, the, battle, of, the, netherlands, this, action, prompted, the, u, s, to, move, its, pacific, fleet, from, southern, california, to, pearl, harbor, to, help, stiffen, british, resolve, to, stay, in, indochina, with, the, japanese, invasion, of, french, indochina, in, september, 1940, came, great, concerns, about, the, possible, japanese, invasion, of, the, dutch, indies, to, secure, their, oil, after, the, u, s, banned, all, exports, of, steel, and, iron, scrap, the, next, day, japan, signed, the, tripartite, pact, and, this, led, washington, to, fear, that, a, complete, u, s, oil, embargo, would, prompt, the, japanese, to, invade, the, dutch, east, indies, on, 16, june, 1941, harold, ickes, who, was, appointed, petroleum, coordinator, for, national, defense, stopped, a, shipment, of, oil, from, philadelphia, to, japan, in, light, of, the, oil, shortage, on, the, east, coast, due, to, increased, exports, to, allies, he, also, telegrammed, all, oil, suppliers, on, the, east, coast, not, to, ship, any, oil, to, japan, without, his, permission, president, roosevelt, countermanded, ickes, s, orders, telling, ickes, that, the, i, simply, have, not, got, enough, navy, to, go, around, and, every, little, episode, in, the, pacific, means, fewer, ships, in, the, atlantic, on, 25, july, 1941, the, u, s, froze, all, japanese, financial, assets, and, licenses, would, be, required, for, each, use, of, the, frozen, funds, including, oil, purchases, that, could, produce, aviation, gasoline, on, 28, july, 1941, japan, invaded, southern, indochina, the, debate, inside, the, japanese, government, as, to, its, oil, and, gasoline, situation, was, leading, to, invasion, of, the, dutch, east, indies, but, this, would, mean, war, with, the, u, s, whose, pacific, fleet, was, a, threat, to, their, flank, this, situation, led, to, the, decision, to, attack, the, u, s, fleet, at, pearl, harbor, before, proceeding, with, the, dutch, east, indies, invasion, on, 7, december, 1941, japan, attacked, pearl, harbor, and, the, next, day, the, netherlands, declared, war, on, japan, which, initiated, the, dutch, east, indies, campaign, but, the, japanese, missed, a, golden, opportunity, at, pearl, harbor, all, of, the, oil, for, the, fleet, was, in, surface, tanks, at, the, time, of, pearl, harbor, admiral, chester, nimitz, who, became, commander, in, chief, of, the, pacific, fleet, was, later, to, say, we, had, about, 4, 1, 2, million, barrels, of, oil, out, there, and, all, of, it, was, vulnerable, to, 50, caliber, bullets, had, the, japanese, destroyed, the, oil, he, added, it, would, have, prolonged, the, war, another, two, years, early, in, 1944, william, boyd, president, of, the, american, petroleum, institute, and, chairman, of, the, petroleum, industry, war, council, said, the, allies, may, have, floated, to, victory, on, a, wave, of, oil, in, world, war, i, but, in, this, infinitely, greater, world, war, ii, we, are, flying, to, victory, on, the, wings, of, petroleum, in, december, 1941, the, u, s, had, 385, 000, oil, wells, producing, 1, 6, billion, barrels, 0, 25, 10, 9, m, 3, 9, 0, 10, 9, cu, ft, barrels, of, oil, a, year, and, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, capacity, was, at, 40, 000, barrels, 6, 400, m, 3, 220, 000, cu, ft, a, day, by, 1944, the, u, s, was, producing, over, 1, 5, billion, barrels, 0, 24, 10, 9, m, 3, 8, 4, 10, 9, cu, ft, a, year, 67, percent, of, world, production, and, the, petroleum, industry, had, built, 122, new, plants, for, the, production, of, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, and, capacity, was, over, 400, 000, barrels, 64, 000, m, 3, 2, 200, 000, cu, ft, a, day, an, increase, of, more, than, ten, fold, it, was, estimated, that, the, u, s, was, producing, enough, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, to, permit, the, dropping, of, 16, 000, metric, tons, 18, 000, short, tons, 16, 000, long, tons, of, bombs, on, the, enemy, every, day, of, the, year, the, record, of, gasoline, consumption, by, the, army, prior, to, june, 1943, was, uncoordinated, as, each, supply, service, of, the, army, purchased, its, own, petroleum, products, and, no, centralized, system, of, control, nor, records, existed, on, 1, june, 1943, the, army, created, the, fuels, and, lubricants, division, of, the, quartermaster, corps, and, from, their, records, they, tabulated, that, the, army, excluding, fuels, and, lubricants, for, aircraft, purchased, over, 9, 1, billion, liters, 2, 4, 10, 9, u, s, gal, of, gasoline, for, delivery, to, overseas, theaters, between, 1, june, 1943, through, august, 1945, that, figure, does, not, include, gasoline, used, by, the, army, inside, the, u, s, motor, fuel, production, had, declined, from, 701, million, barrels, 111, 5, 10, 6, m, 3, 3, 940, 10, 6, cu, ft, in, 1941, down, to, 208, million, barrels, 33, 1, 10, 6, m, 3, 1, 170, 10, 6, cu, ft, in, 1943, world, war, ii, marked, the, first, time, in, u, s, history, that, gasoline, was, rationed, and, the, government, imposed, price, controls, to, prevent, inflation, gasoline, consumption, per, automobile, declined, from, 2, 860, liters, 755, u, s, gal, per, year, in, 1941, down, to, 2, 000, liters, 540, u, s, gal, in, 1943, with, the, goal, of, preserving, rubber, for, tires, since, the, japanese, had, cut, the, u, s, off, from, over, 90, percent, of, its, rubber, supply, which, had, come, from, the, dutch, east, indies, and, the, u, s, synthetic, rubber, industry, was, in, its, infancy, average, gasoline, prices, went, from, a, record, low, of, 0, 0337, per, liter, 0, 1275, u, s, gal, 0, 0486, 0, 1841, with, taxes, in, 1940, to, 0, 0383, per, liter, 0, 1448, u, s, gal, 0, 0542, 0, 2050, with, taxes, in, 1945, even, with, the, world, s, largest, aviation, gasoline, production, the, u, s, military, still, found, that, more, was, needed, throughout, the, duration, of, the, war, aviation, gasoline, supply, was, always, behind, requirements, and, this, impacted, training, and, operations, the, reason, for, this, shortage, developed, before, the, war, even, began, the, free, market, did, not, support, the, expense, of, producing, 100, octane, aviation, fuel, in, large, volume, especially, during, the, great, depression, iso, octane, in, the, early, development, stage, cost, 7, 9, per, liter, 30, u, s, gal, and, even, by, 1934, it, was, still, 0, 53, per, liter, 2, u, s, gal, compared, to, 0, 048, 0, 18, for, motor, gasoline, when, the, army, decided, to, experiment, with, 100, octane, for, its, combat, aircraft, though, only, three, percent, of, u, s, combat, aircraft, in, 1935, could, take, full, advantage, of, the, higher, octane, due, to, low, compression, ratios, the, army, saw, that, the, need, for, increasing, performance, warranted, the, expense, and, purchased, 100, 000, gallons, by, 1937, the, army, established, 100, octane, as, the, standard, fuel, for, combat, aircraft, and, by, 1939, production, was, only, 20, 000, barrels, 3, 200, m, 3, 110, 000, cu, ft, a, day, in, effect, the, u, s, military, was, the, only, market, for, 100, octane, aviation, gasoline, and, as, war, broke, out, in, europe, this, created, a, supply, problem, that, persisted, throughout, the, duration, with, the, war, in, europe, a, reality, in, 1939, all, predictions, of, 100, octane, consumption, were, outrunning, all, possible, production, neither, the, army, nor, the, navy, could, contract, more, than, six, months, in, advance, for, fuel, and, they, could, not, supply, the, funds, for, plant, expansion, without, a, long, term, guaranteed, market, the, petroleum, industry, would, not, risk, its, capital, to, expand, production, for, a, product, that, only, the, government, would, buy, the, solution, to, the, expansion, of, storage, transportation, finances, and, production, was, the, creation, of, the, defense, supplies, corporation, on, 19, september, 1940, the, defense, supplies, corporation, would, buy, transport, and, store, all, aviation, gasoline, for, the, army, and, navy, at, cost, plus, a, carrying, fee, when, the, allied, breakout, after, d, day, found, their, armies, stretching, their, supply, lines, to, a, dangerous, point, the, makeshift, solution, was, the, red, ball, express, but, even, this, soon, was, inadequate, the, trucks, in, the, convoys, had, to, drive, longer, distances, as, the, armies, advanced, and, they, were, consuming, a, greater, percentage, of, the, same, gasoline, they, were, trying, to, deliver, in, 1944, general, george, patton, s, third, army, finally, stalled, just, short, of, the, german, border, after, running, out, of, gasoline, the, general, was, so, upset, at, the, arrival, of, a, truckload, of, rations, instead, of, gasoline, he, was, reported, to, have, shouted, hell, they, send, us, food, when, they, know, we, can, fight, without, food, but, not, without, oil, the, solution, had, to, wait, for, the, repairing, of, the, railroad, lines, and, bridges, so, that, the, more, efficient, trains, could, replace, the, gasoline, consuming, truck, convoys, the, development, of, jet, engines, burning, kerosene, based, fuels, during, wwii, for, aircraft, produced, a, superior, performing, propulsion, system, than, internal, combustion, engines, could, offer, and, the, u, s, military, forces, gradually, replaced, their, piston, combat, aircraft, with, jet, powered, planes, this, development, would, essentially, remove, the, military, need, for, ever, increasing, octane, fuels, and, eliminated, government, support, for, the, refining, industry, to, pursue, the, research, and, production, of, such, exotic, and, expensive, fuels, commercial, aviation, was, slower, to, adapt, to, jet, propulsion, and, until, 1958, when, the, boeing, 707, first, entered, commercial, service, piston, powered, airliners, still, relied, on, aviation, gasoline, but, commercial, aviation, had, greater, economic, concerns, than, the, maximum, performance, that, the, military, could, afford, as, octane, numbers, increased, so, did, the, cost, of, gasoline, but, the, incremental, increase, in, efficiency, becomes, less, as, compression, ratio, goes, up, this, reality, set, a, practical, limit, to, how, high, compression, ratios, could, increase, relative, to, how, expensive, the, gasoline, would, become, last, produced, in, 1955, the, pratt, whitney, r, 4360, wasp, major, was, using, 115, 145, aviation, gasoline, and, producing, 0, 046, kilowatts, per, cubic, centimeter, 1, hp, cu, in, at, 6, 7, compression, ratio, turbo, supercharging, would, increase, this, and, 0, 45, kilograms, 1, lb, of, engine, weight, to, produce, 0, 82, kilowatts, 1, 1, hp, this, compares, to, the, wright, brothers, engine, needing, almost, 7, 7, kilograms, 17, lb, of, engine, weight, to, produce, 0, 75, kilowatts, 1, hp, the, u, s, automobile, industry, after, wwii, could, not, take, advantage, of, the, high, octane, fuels, then, available, automobile, compression, ratios, increased, from, an, average, of, 5, 3, to, 1, in, 1931, to, just, 6, 7, to, 1, in, 1946, the, average, octane, number, of, regular, grade, motor, gasoline, increased, from, 58, to, 70, during, the, same, time, military, aircraft, were, using, expensive, turbo, supercharged, engines, that, cost, at, least, 10, times, as, much, per, horsepower, as, automobile, engines, and, had, to, be, overhauled, every, 700, to, 1, 000, hours, the, automobile, market, could, not, support, such, expensive, engines, it, would, not, be, until, 1957, that, the, first, u, s, automobile, manufacturer, could, mass, produce, an, engine, that, would, produce, one, horsepower, per, cubic, inch, the, chevrolet, 283, hp, 283, cubic, inch, v, 8, engine, option, in, the, corvette, at, 485, this, was, an, expensive, option, that, few, consumers, could, afford, and, would, only, appeal, to, the, performance, oriented, consumer, market, willing, to, pay, for, the, premium, fuel, required, this, engine, had, an, advertised, compression, ratio, of, 10, 5, to, 1, and, the, 1958, ama, specifications, stated, that, the, octane, requirement, was, 96, 100, ron, at, 243, kilograms, 535, lb, 1959, with, aluminum, intake, it, took, 0, 86, kilograms, 1, 9, lb, of, engine, weight, to, make, 0, 75, kilowatts, 1, hp, in, the, 1950s, oil, refineries, started, to, focus, on, high, octane, fuels, and, then, detergents, were, added, to, gasoline, to, clean, the, jets, in, carburetors, the, 1970s, witnessed, greater, attention, to, the, environmental, consequences, of, burning, gasoline, these, considerations, led, to, the, phasing, out, of, tel, and, its, replacement, by, other, antiknock, compounds, subsequently, low, sulfur, gasoline, was, introduced, in, part, to, preserve, the, catalysts, in, modern, exhaust, systems, commercial, gas, is, a, mixture, of, a, large, number, of, different, hydrocarbons, chemical, gasoline, is, produced, to, meet, a, number, of, engine, performance, specifications, and, many, different, compositions, are, possible, hence, the, exact, chemical, composition, of, gasoline, is, undefined, the, performance, specification, also, varies, with, season, requiring, less, volatile, blends, during, summer, in, order, to, minimize, evaporative, losses, at, the, refinery, the, composition, varies, according, to, the, crude, oils, from, which, it, is, produced, the, type, of, processing, units, present, at, the, refinery, how, those, units, are, operated, and, which, hydrocarbon, streams, blendstocks, the, refinery, opts, to, use, when, blending, the, final, product, gasoline, is, produced, in, oil, refineries, roughly, 72, liters, 19, u, s, gal, of, gasoline, is, derived, from, a, 160, liter, 42, u, s, gal, barrel, of, crude, oil, material, separated, from, crude, oil, via, distillation, called, virgin, or, straight, run, gasoline, does, not, meet, specifications, for, modern, engines, particularly, the, octane, rating, see, below, but, can, be, pooled, to, the, gasoline, blend, the, bulk, of, a, typical, gasoline, consists, of, a, homogeneous, mixture, of, small, relatively, lightweight, hydrocarbons, with, between, 4, and, 12, carbon, atoms, per, molecule, commonly, referred, to, as, c4, c12, it, is, a, mixture, of, paraffins, alkanes, olefins, alkenes, and, napthenes, cycloalkanes, the, use, of, the, term, paraffin, in, place, of, the, standard, chemical, nomenclature, alkane, is, particular, to, the, oil, industry, the, actual, ratio, of, molecules, in, any, gasoline, depends, upon, the, various, refinery, streams, blended, to, make, gasoline, have, different, characteristics, some, important, streams, include, the, following, the, terms, above, are, the, jargon, used, in, the, oil, industry, and, the, terminology, varies, currently, many, countries, set, limits, on, gasoline, aromatics, in, general, benzene, in, particular, and, olefin, alkene, content, such, regulations, have, led, to, an, increasing, preference, for, alkane, isomers, such, as, isomerate, or, alkylate, as, their, octane, rating, is, higher, than, n, alkanes, in, the, european, union, the, benzene, limit, is, set, at, one, percent, by, volume, for, all, grades, of, automotive, gasoline, this, is, usually, achieved, by, avoiding, feeding, c6, in, particular, cyclohexane, to, the, reformer, unit, where, it, would, be, converted, to, benzene, therefore, only, desulfurized, heavy, virgin, naphtha, hvn, is, fed, to, the, reformer, unit, gasoline, can, also, contain, other, organic, compounds, such, as, organic, ethers, deliberately, added, plus, small, levels, of, contaminants, in, particular, organosulfur, compounds, which, are, usually, removed, at, the, refinery, the, specific, gravity, of, gasoline, ranges, from, 0, 71, to, 0, 77, with, higher, densities, having, a, greater, volume, fraction, of, aromatics, finished, marketable, gasoline, is,

internal, combustion, engine, without, too, much, trouble, however, the, effects, of, long, term, storage, will, become, more, noticeable, with, each, passing, month, until, a, time, comes, when, the, gasoline, should, be, diluted, with, ever, increasing, amounts, of, freshly, made, fuel, so, that, the, older, gasoline, may, be, used, up, if, left, undiluted, improper, operation, will, occur, and, this, may, include, engine, damage, from, misfiring, or, the, lack, of, proper, action, of, the, fuel, within, a, fuel, injection, system, and, from, an, onboard, computer, attempting, to, compensate, if, applicable, to, the, vehicle, gasoline, should, ideally, be, stored, in, an, airtight, container, to, prevent, oxidation, or, water, vapor, mixing, in, with, the, gas, that, can, withstand, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, gasoline, without, venting, to, prevent, the, loss, of, the, more, volatile, fractions, at, a, stable, cool, temperature, to, reduce, the, excess, pressure, from, liquid, expansion, and, to, reduce, the, rate, of, any, decomposition, reactions, when, gasoline, is, not, stored, correctly, gums, and, solids, may, result, which, can, corrode, system, components, and, accumulate, on, wet, surfaces, resulting, in, a, condition, called, stale, fuel, gasoline, containing, ethanol, is, especially, subject, to, absorbing, atmospheric, moisture, then, forming, gums,

lower, power, output, at, the, typical, 10, 1, compression, ratio, of, an, engine, design, optimized, for, gasoline, fuel, an, engine, tuned, for, lpg, fuel, via, higher, compression, ratios, typically, 12, 1, improves, the, power, output, this, is, because, higher, octane, fuels, allow, for, a, higher, compression, ratio, without, knocking, resulting, in, a, higher, cylinder, temperature, which, improves, efficiency, also, increased, mechanical, efficiency, is, created, by, a, higher, compression, ratio, through, the, concomitant, higher, expansion, ratio, on, the, power, stroke, which, is, by, far, the, greater, effect, the, higher, expansion, ratio, extracts, more, work, from, the, high, pressure, gas, created, by, the, combustion, process, an, atkinson, cycle, engine, uses, the, timing, of, the, valve, events, to, produce, the, benefits, of, a, high, expansion, ratio, without, the, disadvantages, chiefly, detonation, of, a, high, compression, ratio, a, high, expansion, ratio, is, also, one, of, the, two, key, reasons, for, the, efficiency, of, diesel, engines, along, with, the, elimination, of, pumping, losses, due, to, throttling, of, the, intake, airflow, the, lower, energy, content, of, lpg, by, liquid, volume, in, comparison, to, gasoline, is, due, mainly, to, its, lower, density, this, lower, density, is, a, property, of, the, lower, molecular, weight, of, propane, lpg, s, chief, component, compared, to, gasoline, s, blend, of, various, hydrocarbon, compounds, with, heavier, molecular, weights, than, propane, conversely, lpg, s, energy, content, by, weight, is, higher, than, gasoline, s, due, to, a, higher, hydrogen, to, carbon, ratio, molecular, weights, of, the, species, in, the, representative, octane, combustion, are, 114, 32, 44, and, 18, for, c, 8, h, 18, o, 2, co, 2, and, h, 2, o, respectively, therefore, one, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, of, fuel, reacts, with, 3, 51, kilograms, 7, 7, lb, of, oxygen, to, produce, 3, 09, kilograms, 6, 8, lb,

mixture, may, autoignite, by, pressure, and, heat, alone, rather, than, igniting, from, the, spark, plug, at, exactly, the, right, time, causing, a, rapid, pressure, rise, that, can, damage, the, engine, this, is, often, referred, to, as, engine, knocking, or, end, gas, knock, knocking, can, be, reduced, by, increasing, the, gasoline, s, resistance, to, autoignition, which, is, expressed, by, its, octane, rating, octane, rating, is, measured, relative, to, a, mixture, of, 2, 2, 4, trimethylpentane, an, isomer, of, octane, and, n, heptane, there, are, different, conventions, for, expressing, octane, ratings, so, the, same, physical, fuel, may, have, several, different, octane, ratings, based, on, the, measure, used, one, of, the, best, known, is, the, research, octane, number, ron, the, octane, rating, of, typical, commercially, available, gasoline, varies, by, country, in, finland, sweden, and, norway, 95, ron, is, the, standard, for, regular, unleaded, gasoline, and, 98, ron, is, also, available, as, a, more, expensive, option, in, the, united, kingdom, over, 95, percent, of, gasoline, sold, has, 95, ron, and, is, marketed, as, unleaded, or, premium, unleaded, super, unleaded, with, 97, 98, ron, and, branded, high, performance, fuels, e, g, shell, v, power, bp, ultimate, with, 99, ron, make, up, the, balance, gasoline, with, 102, ron, may, rarely, be, available, for, racing, purposes, in, the, u, s, octane, ratings, in, unleaded, fuels, vary, between, 85, and, 87, aki, 91, 92, ron, for, regular, 89, 90, aki, 94, 95, ron, for, mid, grade, equivalent, to,

above, sea, level, the, automobile, association, of, south, africa, recommends, 95, octane, gasoline, at, low, altitude, and, 93, octane, for, use, in, johannesburg, because, the, higher, the, altitude, the, lower, the, air, pressure, and, the, lower, the, need, for, a, high, octane, fuel, as, there, is, no, real, performance, gain, octane, rating, became, important, as, the, military, sought, higher, output, for, aircraft, engines, in, the, late, 1920s, and, the, 1940s, a, higher, octane, rating, allows, a, higher, compression, ratio, or, supercharger, boost, and, thus, higher, temperatures, and, pressures, which, translate, to, higher, power, output, some, scientists, even, predicted, that, a, nation, with, a, good, supply, of, high, octane, gasoline, would, have, the, advantage, in, air, power, in, 1943, the, rolls, royce, merlin, aero, engine, produced, 980, kilowatts, 1, 320, hp, using, 100, ron, fuel, from, a, modest, 27, liters, 1, 600, cu, in, displacement,

aniline, to, 100, octane, avgas, by, this, time, the, rolls, royce, merlin, 66, was, developing, 1, 500, kilowatts, 2, 000, hp, using, this, fuel, gasoline, when, used, in, high, compression, internal, combustion, engines, tends, to, auto, ignite, or, detonate, causing, damaging, engine, knocking, also, called, pinging, or, pinking, to, address, this, problem, tetraethyl, lead, tel, was, widely, adopted, as, an, additive, for, gasoline, in, the, 1920s, with, a, growing, awareness, of, the, seriousness, of, the, extent, of, environmental, and, health, damage, caused, by, lead, compounds, however, and, the, incompatibility, of, lead, with, catalytic, converters, governments, began, to, mandate, reductions, in, gasoline, lead, in, the, u, s, the, environmental, protection, agency, issued, regulations, to, reduce, the, lead, content, of, leaded, gasoline, over, a, series, of, annual, phases, scheduled, to, begin, in, 1973, but, delayed, by, court, appeals, until, 1976, by, 1995, leaded, fuel, accounted, for, only, 0, 6, percent, of, total, gasoline, sales, and, under, 1, 800, metric, tons, 2, 000, short, tons, 1, 800, long, tons, of, lead, per, year, from, 1, january, 1996, the, u, s, clean, air, act, banned, the, sale, of, leaded, fuel, for, use, in, on, road, vehicles, in, the, u, s, the, use, of, tel, also, necessitated, other, additives, such, as, dibromoethane, european, countries, began, replacing, lead, containing, additives, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1990s, leaded, gasoline, was, banned, within, the, entire, european, union, with, an, exception, for, avgas, 100ll, for, general, aviation, the, uae, started, to, switch, to, unleaded, in, the, early, 2000s, reduction, in, the, average, lead, content, of, human, blood, may, be, a, major, cause, for, falling, violent, crime, rates, around, the, world, including, south, africa, a, study, found, a, correlation, between, leaded, gasoline, usage, and, violent, crime, see, lead, crime, hypothesis, other, studies, found, no, correlation, in, august, 2021, the, un, environment, programme, announced, that, leaded, petrol, had, been, eradicated, worldwide, with, algeria, being, the, last, country, to, deplete, its, reserves, un, secretary, general, ant, nio, guterres, called, the, eradication, of, leaded, petrol, an, international, success, story, he, also, added, ending, the, use, of, leaded, petrol, will, prevent, more, than, one, million, premature, deaths, each, year, from, heart, disease, strokes, and, cancer, and, it, will, protect, children, whose, iqs, are, damaged, by, exposure, to, lead, greenpeace, called, the, announcement, the, end, of, one, toxic, era, however, leaded, gasoline, continues, to, be, used, in, aeronautic, auto, racing, and, off, road, applications, the, use, of, leaded, additives, is, still, permitted, worldwide, for, the, formulation, of, some, grades, of, aviation, gasoline, such, as, 100ll, because, the, required, octane, rating, is, difficult, to, reach, without, the, use, of, leaded, additives, different, additives, have, replaced, lead, compounds, the, most, popular, additives, include, aromatic, hydrocarbons, ethers, mtbe, and, etbe, and, alcohols, most, commonly, ethanol, lead, replacement, petrol, lrp, was, developed, for, vehicles, designed, to, run, on, leaded, fuels, and, incompatible, with, unleaded, fuels, rather, than, tetraethyllead, it, contains, other, metals, such, as, potassium, compounds, or, methylcyclopentadienyl, manganese, tricarbonyl, mmt, these, are, purported, to, buffer, soft, exhaust, valves, and, seats, so, that, they, do, not, suffer, recession, due, to, the, use, of, unleaded, fuel, lrp, was, marketed, during, and, after, the, phaseout, of, leaded, motor, fuels, in, the, united, kingdom, australia, south, africa, and, some, other, countries, consumer, confusion, led, to, a, widespread, mistaken, preference, for, lrp, rather, than, unleaded, and, lrp, was, phased, out, 8, to, 10, years, after, the, introduction, of, unleaded, leaded, gasoline, was, withdrawn, from, sale, in, britain, after, 31, december, 1999, seven, years, after, eec, regulations, signaled, the, end, of, production, for, cars, using, leaded, gasoline, in, member, states, at, this, stage, a, large, percentage, of, cars, from, the, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, which, ran, on, leaded, gasoline, were, still, in, use, along, with, cars, that, could, run, on, unleaded, fuel, however, the, declining, number, of, such, cars, on, british, roads, saw, many, gasoline, stations, withdrawing, lrp, from, sale, by, 2003, methylcyclopentadienyl, manganese, tricarbonyl, mmt, is, used, in, canada, and, the, u, s, to, boost, octane, rating, its, use, in, the, u,

degradation, of, gasoline, during, long, term, storage, these, harmful, deposits, arise, from, the, oxidation, of, alkenes, and, other, minor, components, in, gasoline, see, drying, oils, improvements, in, refinery, techniques, have, generally, reduced, the, susceptibility, of, gasolines, to, these, problems, previously, catalytically, or, thermally, cracked, gasolines, were, most, susceptible, to, oxidation, the, formation, of, gums, is, accelerated, by, copper, salts, which, can, be, neutralized, by, additives, called, metal, deactivators, this, degradation, can, be, prevented, through, the, addition, of, 5, 100, ppm, of, antioxidants, such, as, phenylenediamines, and, other, amines, hydrocarbons, with, a, bromine, number, of, 10, or, above, can, be, protected,

national, agency, of, petroleum, natural, gas, and, biofuels, anp, requires, gasoline, for, automobile, use, to, have, 27, 5, percent, of, ethanol, added, to, its, composition, pure, hydrated, ethanol, is, also, available, as, a, fuel, legislation, requires, retailers, to, label, fuels, containing, ethanol, on, the, dispenser, and, limits, ethanol, use, to, 10, percent, of, gasoline, in, australia, such, gasoline, is, commonly, called, e10, by, major, brands, and, it, is, cheaper, than, regular, unleaded, gasoline, the, federal, renewable, fuel, standard, rfs, effectively, requires, refiners, and, blenders, to, blend, renewable, biofuels, mostly, ethanol, with, gasoline, sufficient, to, meet, a, growing, annual, target, of, total, gallons, blended, although, the, mandate, does, not, require, a, specific, percentage, of, ethanol, annual, increases, in, the, target, combined, with, declining, gasoline, consumption, have, caused, the, typical, ethanol, content, in, gasoline, to, approach, 10, percent, most, fuel, pumps, display, a, sticker, that, states, that, the, fuel, may, contain, up, to, 10, percent, ethanol, an, intentional, disparity, that, reflects, the, varying, actual, percentage, until, late, 2010, fuel, retailers, were, only, authorized, to, sell, fuel, containing, up, to, 10, percent, ethanol, e10, and, most, vehicle, warranties, except, for, flexible,

in, canada, native, children, in, the, isolated, northern, labrador, community, of, davis, inlet, were, the, focus, of, national, concern, in, 1993, when, many, were, found, to, be, sniffing, gasoline, the, canadian, and, provincial, newfoundland, and, labrador, governments, intervened, on, several, occasions, sending, many, children, away, for, treatment, despite, being, moved, to, the, new, community, of, natuashish, in, 2002, serious, inhalant, abuse, problems, have, continued, similar, problems, were, reported, in, sheshatshiu, in, 2000, and, also, in, pikangikum, first, nation, in, 2012, the, issue, once, again, made, the, news, media, in, canada, australia, has, long, faced, a, petrol, gasoline, sniffing, problem, in, isolated, and, impoverished, aboriginal, communities, although, some, sources, argue, that, sniffing, was, introduced, by, u, s, servicemen, stationed, in, the, nation, s, top, end, during, world, war, ii, or, through, experimentation, by, 1940s, era, cobourg, peninsula, sawmill, workers, other, sources, claim, that, inhalant, abuse, such, as, glue, inhalation, emerged, in, australia, in, the, late, 1960s, chronic, heavy, petrol, sniffing, appears, to, occur, among, remote, impoverished, indigenous, communities, where, the, ready, accessibility, of, petrol, has, helped, to, make, it, a, common, substance, for, abuse, in, australia, petrol, sniffing, now, occurs, widely, throughout, remote, aboriginal, communities, in, the, northern, territory, western, australia, northern, parts, of, south, australia, and, queensland, the, number, of, people, sniffing, petrol, goes, up, and, down, over, time, as, young, people, experiment, or, sniff, occasionally, boss, or, chronic, sniffers, may, move, in, and, out, of, communities, they, are, often, responsible, for, encouraging, young, people, to, take, it, up, in, 2005, the, government, of, australia, and, bp, australia, began, the, usage, of, opal, fuel, in, remote, areas, prone, to, petrol, sniffing, opal, is, a, non, sniffable, fuel, which, is, much, less, likely, to, cause, a, high, and, has, made, a, difference, in, some, indigenous, communities, gasoline, is, extremely, flammable, due, to, its, low, flash, point, of, 23, c, 9, f, like, other, hydrocarbons, gasoline, burns, in, a, limited, range, of, its, vapor, phase, and, coupled, with, its, volatility, this, makes, leaks, highly, dangerous, when, sources, of, ignition, are, present, gasoline, has, a, lower, explosive, limit, of, 1, 4, percent, by, volume, and, an, upper, explosive, limit, of, 7, 6, percent, if, the, concentration, is, below, 1, 4, percent, the, air, gasoline, mixture, is, too, lean, and, does, not, ignite, if, the, concentration, is, above, 7, 6, percent, the, mixture, is, too, rich, and, also, does, not, ignite, however, gasoline, vapor, rapidly, mixes, and, spreads, with, air, making, unconstrained, gasoline, quickly, flammable, the, exhaust, gas, generated, by, burning, gasoline, is, harmful, to, both, the, environment, and, to, human, health, after, co, is, inhaled, into, the, human, body, it, readily, combines, with, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, and, its, affinity, is, 300, times, that, of, oxygen, therefore, the, hemoglobin, in, the, lungs, combines, with, co, instead, of, oxygen, causing, the, human, body, to, be, hypoxic, causing, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and, other, poisoning, symptoms, in, severe, cases, it, may, lead, to, death, hydrocarbons, only, affect, the, human, body, when, their, concentration, is, quite, high, and, their, toxicity, level, depends, on, the, chemical, composition, the, hydrocarbons, produced, by, incomplete, combustion, include, alkanes, aromatics, and, aldehydes, among, them, a, concentration, of, methane, and, ethane, over, 35, g, m, 3, 0, 035, oz, cu, ft, will, cause, loss, of, consciousness, or, suffocation, a, concentration, of, pentane, and, hexane, over, 45, g, m, 3, 0, 045, oz, cu, ft, will, have, an, anesthetic, effect, and, aromatic, hydrocarbons, will, have, more, serious, effects, on, health, blood, toxicity, neurotoxicity, and, cancer, if, the, concentration, of, benzene, exceeds, 40, ppm, it, can, cause, leukemia, and, xylene, can, cause, headache, dizziness, nausea, and, vomiting, human, exposure, to, large, amounts, of, aldehydes, can, cause, eye, irritation, nausea, and, dizziness, in, addition, to, carcinogenic, effects, long, term, exposure, can, cause, damage, to, the, skin, liver, kidneys, and, cataracts, after, no, x, enters, the, alveoli, it, has, a, severe, stimulating, effect, on, the, lung, tissue, it, can, irritate, the, conjunctiva, of, the, eyes, cause, tearing, and, cause, pink, eyes, it, also, has, a, stimulating, effect, on, the, nose, pharynx, throat, and, other, organs, it, can, cause, acute, wheezing, breathing, difficulties, red, eyes, sore, throat, and, dizziness, causing, poisoning, in, recent, years, with, the, rapid, development, of, the, motor, vehicle, economy, the, production, and, use, of, motor, vehicles, have, increased, dramatically, and, the, pollution, by, motor, vehicle, exhaust, to, the, environment, has, become, more, and, more, serious, the, air, pollution, in, many, large, cities, has, changed, from, coal, burning, pollution, to, motor, vehicle, pollution, in, the, u, s, transportation, is, the, largest, source, of, carbon, emissions, accounting, for, 30, percent, of, the, total, carbon, footprint, of, the, u, s, combustion, of, gasoline, produces, 2, 35, kilograms, per, liter, 19, 6, lb, u, s, gal, of, carbon, dioxide, a, greenhouse, gas, unburnt, gasoline, and, evaporation, from, the, tank, when, in, the, atmosphere, react, in, sunlight, to, produce, photochemical, smog, vapor, pressure, initially, rises, with, some, addition, of, ethanol, to, gasoline, but, the, increase, is, greatest, at, 10, percent, by, volume, at, higher, concentrations, of, ethanol, above, 10, percent, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, blend, starts, to, decrease, at, a, 10, percent, ethanol, by, volume, the, rise, in, vapor, pressure, may, potentially, increase, the, problem, of, photochemical, smog, this, rise, in, vapor, pressure, could, be, mitigated, by, increasing, or, decreasing, the, percentage, of, ethanol, in, the, gasoline, mixture, the, chief, risks, of, such, leaks, come, not, from, vehicles, but, gasoline, delivery, truck, accidents, and, leaks, from, storage, tanks, because, of, this, risk, most, underground, storage, tanks, now, have, extensive, measures, in, place, to, detect, and, prevent, any, such, leaks, such, as, monitoring, systems, veeder, root, franklin, fueling, production, of, gasoline, consumes, 1, 5, liters, per, kilometer, 0, 63, u, s, gal, mi, of, water, by, driven, distance, gasoline, use, causes, a, variety, of, deleterious, effects, to, the, human, population, and, to, the, climate, generally, the, harms, imposed, include, a, higher, rate, of, premature, death, and, ailments, such, as, asthma, caused, by, air, pollution, higher, healthcare, costs, for, the, public, generally, decreased, crop, yields, missed, work, and, school, days, due, to, illness, increased, flooding, and, other, extreme, weather, events, linked, to, global, climate, change, and, other, social, costs, the, costs, imposed, on, society, and, the, planet, are, estimated, to, be, 3, 80, per, gallon, of, gasoline, in, addition, to, the, price, paid, at, the, pump, by, the, user, the, damage, to, the, health, and, climate, caused, by, a, gasoline, powered, vehicle, greatly, exceeds, that,

world, fuel, economy, and, rated, performance, gasoline, enters, the, environment, through, the, soil, groundwater, surface, water, and, air, therefore, humans, may, be, exposed, to, gasoline, through, methods, such, as, breathing, eating, and, skin, contact, for, example, using, gasoline, filled, equipment, such, as, lawnmowers, drinking, gasoline, contaminated, water, close, to, gasoline, spills, or, leaks, to, the, soil, working, at, a, gasoline, station, inhaling, gasoline, volatile, gas, when, refueling, at, a, gasoline, station, is, the, easiest, way, to, be, exposed, to, gasoline, the, international, energy, agency, said, in, 2021, that, road, fuels, should, be, taxed, at, a, rate, that, reflects, their, impact, on, people, s, health, and, the, climate, countries, in, europe, impose, substantially, higher, taxes, on, fuels, such, as, gasoline, when, compared, to, the, u, s, the, price, of, gasoline, in, europe, is, typically, higher, than, that, in, the, u, s, due, to, this, difference, from, 1998, to, 2004, the, price, of, gasoline, fluctuated, between, 0, 26, and, 0, 53, per, liter, 1, and, 2, u, s, gal, after, 2004, the, price, increased, until, the, average, gasoline, price, reached, a, high, of, 1, 09, per, liter, 4, 11, u, s, gal, in, mid, 2008, but, receded, to, approximately, 0, 69, per, liter, 2, 60, u, s, gal, by, september, 2009, the, u, s, experienced, an, upswing, in, gasoline, prices, through, 2011, and, by, 1, march, 2012, the, national, average, was, 0, 99, per, liter, 3, 74, u, s, gal, california, prices, are, higher, because, the, california, government, mandates, unique, california, gasoline, formulas, and, taxes, in, the, u, s, most, consumer, goods, bear, pre, tax, prices, but, gasoline, prices, are, posted, with, taxes, included, taxes, are, added, by, federal, state, and, local, governments, as, of, 2009, the, federal, tax, was, 0, 049, per, liter, 0, 184, u, s, gal, for, gasoline, and, 0, 064, per, liter, 0, 244, u, s, gal, for, diesel, excluding, red, diesel, about, nine, percent, of, all, gasoline, sold, in, the, u, s, in, may, 2009, was, premium, grade, according, to, the, energy, information, administration, consumer, reports, magazine, says, if, says, to, use, regular, fuel, do, so, there, s, no, advantage, to, a, higher, grade, the, associated, press, said, premium, gas, which, has, a, higher, octane, rating, and, costs, more, per, gallon, than, regular, unleaded, should, be, used, only, if, the, manufacturer, says, it, is, required, cars, with, turbocharged, engines, and, high, compression, ratios, often, specify, premium, gasoline, because, higher, octane, fuels, reduce, the, incidence, of, knock, or, fuel, pre, detonation, the, price, of, gasoline, varies, considerably, between, the, summer, and, winter, months, there, is, a, considerable, difference, between, summer, oil, and, winter, oil, in, gasoline, vapor, pressure, reid, vapor, pressure, rvp, which, is, a, measure, of, how, easily, the, fuel, evaporates, at, a, given, temperature, the, higher, the, gasoline, volatility, the, higher, the, rvp, the, easier, it, is, to, evaporate, the, conversion, between, the, two, fuels, occurs, twice, a, year, once, in, autumn, winter, mix, and, the, other, in, spring, summer, mix, the, winter, blended, fuel, has, a, higher, rvp, because, the, fuel, must, be, able, to, evaporate, at, a, low, temperature, for, the, engine, to, run, normally, if, the, rvp, is, too, low, on, a, cold, day, the, vehicle, will, be, difficult, to, start, however, the, summer, blended, gasoline, has, a, lower, rvp, it, prevents, excessive, evaporation, when, the, outdoor, temperature, rises, reduces, ozone, emissions, and, reduces, smog, levels, at, the, same, time, vapor, lock, is,
