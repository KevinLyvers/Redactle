a, lock, is, a, device, used, for, raising, and, lowering, boats, ships, and, other, watercraft, between, stretches, of, water, of, different, levels, on, river, and, canal, waterways, the, distinguishing, feature, of, a, lock, is, a, fixed, chamber, in, which, the, water, level, can, be, varied, whereas, in, a, caisson, lock, a, boat, lift, or, on, a, canal, inclined, plane, it, is, the, chamber, itself, usually, then, called, a, caisson, that, rises, and, falls, locks, are, used, to, make, a, river, more, easily, navigable, or, to, allow, a, canal, to, cross, land, that, is, not, level, later, canals, used, more, and, larger, locks, to, allow, a, more, direct, route, to, be, taken, a, pound, lock, is, most, commonly, used, on, canals, and, rivers, today, a, pound, lock, has, a, chamber, with, gates, at, both, ends, that, control, the, level, of, water, in, the, pound, in, contrast, an, earlier, design, with, a, single, gate, was, known, as, a, flash, lock, pound, locks, were, first, used, in, china, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ce, having, been, pioneered, by, the, song, politician, and, naval, engineer, qiao, weiyue, in, 984, they, replaced, earlier, double, slipways, that, had, caused, trouble, and, are, mentioned, by, the, chinese, polymath, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, in, his, book, dream, pool, essays, published, in, 1088, and, fully, described, in, the, chinese, historical, text, song, shi, compiled, in, 1345, the, distance, between, the, two, locks, was, rather, more, than, 50, paces, and, the, whole, space, was, covered, with, a, great, roof, like, a, shed, the, gates, were, hanging, gates, when, they, were, closed, the, water, accumulated, like, a, tide, until, the, required, level, was, reached, and, then, when, the, time, came, it, was, allowed, to, flow, out, the, water, level, could, differ, by, 4, or, 5, feet, 1, 2, or, 1, 5, m, at, each, lock, and, in, the, grand, canal, the, level, was, raised, in, this, way, by, 138, feet, 42, m, in, medieval, europe, a, sort, of, pound, lock, was, built, in, 1373, at, vreeswijk, netherlands, this, pound, lock, serviced, many, ships, at, once, in, a, large, basin, yet, the, first, true, pound, lock, was, built, in, 1396, at, damme, near, bruges, belgium, the, italian, bertola, da, novate, c, 1410, 1475, constructed, 18, pound, locks, on, the, naviglio, di, bereguardo, part, of, the, milan, canal, system, sponsored, by, francesco, sforza, between, 1452, and, 1458, in, ancient, egypt, the, river, locks, was, probably, part, of, the, canal, of, the, pharaohs, ptolemy, ii, is, credited, by, some, for, being, the, first, to, solve, the, problem, of, keeping, the, nile, free, of, salt, water, when, his, engineers, invented, the, lock, around, 274, 273, bc, all, pound, locks, have, three, elements, the, principle, of, operating, a, lock, is, simple, for, instance, if, a, boat, travelling, downstream, finds, the, lock, already, full, of, water, if, the, lock, were, empty, the, boat, would, have, had, to, wait, 5, to, 10, minutes, while, the, lock, was, filled, for, a, boat, travelling, upstream, the, process, is, reversed, the, boat, enters, the, empty, lock, and, then, the, chamber, is, filled, by, opening, a, valve, that, allows, water, to, enter, the, chamber, from, the, upper, level, the, whole, operation, will, usually, take, between, 10, and, 20, minutes, depending, on, the, size, of, the, lock, and, whether, the, water, in, the, lock, was, originally, set, at, the, boat, s, level, boaters, approaching, a, lock, are, usually, pleased, to, meet, another, boat, coming, towards, them, because, this, boat, will, have, just, exited, the, lock, on, their, level, and, therefore, set, the, lock, in, their, favour, saving, about, 5, to, 10, minutes, however, this, is, not, true, for, staircase, locks, where, it, is, quicker, for, boats, to, go, through, in, convoy, and, it, also, uses, less, water, the, rise, is, the, change, in, water, level, in, the, lock, the, two, deepest, locks, on, the, english, canal, system, are, bath, deep, lock, on, the, kennet, and, avon, canal, and, tuel, lane, lock, on, the, rochdale, canal, which, both, have, a, rise, of, nearly, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, both, locks, are, amalgamations, of, two, separate, locks, which, were, combined, when, the, canals, were, restored, to, accommodate, changes, in, road, crossings, by, comparison, the, carrapatelo, and, valeira, locks, on, the, douro, river, in, portugal, which, are, 279, feet, 85, m, long, and, 39, feet, 12, m, wide, have, maximum, lifts, of, 115, and, 108, feet, 35, and, 33, m, respectively, the, two, ardnacrusha, locks, near, limerick, on, the, shannon, navigation, in, ireland, have, a, rise, of, 100, feet, 30, m, the, upper, chamber, rises, 60, feet, 18, m, and, is, connected, to, the, lower, chamber, by, a, tunnel, which, when, descending, does, not, become, visible, until, the, chamber, is, nearly, empty, a, pound, is, the, level, stretch, of, water, between, two, locks, also, known, as, a, reach, the, cill, also, spelled, sill, is, a, narrow, horizontal, ledge, protruding, a, short, way, into, the, chamber, from, below, the, upper, gates, allowing, the, rear, of, the, boat, to, hang, on, the, cill, is, the, main, danger, when, descending, a, lock, and, the, position, of, the, forward, edge, of, the, cill, is, usually, marked, on, the, lock, side, by, a, white, line, the, edge, of, the, cill, is, usually, curved, protruding, less, in, the, center, than, at, the, edges, in, some, locks, there, is, a, piece, of, oak, about, 9, in, 23, cm, thick, which, protects, the, solid, part, of, the, lock, cill, on, the, oxford, canal, it, is, called, a, babbie, on, the, grand, union, canal, it, is, referred, to, as, the, cill, bumper, some, canal, operation, authorities, primarily, in, the, united, states, and, canada, call, the, ledge, a, miter, sill, mitre, sill, in, canada, gates, are, the, watertight, doors, which, seal, off, the, chamber, from, the, upper, and, lower, pounds, each, end, of, the, chamber, is, equipped, with, a, gate, or, pair, of, half, gates, traditionally, made, of, oak, or, elm, but, now, usually, made, of, steel, the, most, common, arrangement, usually, called, miter, gates, was, invented, by, leonardo, da, vinci, sometime, around, the, late, 15th, century, on, the, old, erie, canal, there, was, a, danger, of, injury, when, operating, the, paddles, water, on, reaching, a, certain, position, would, push, the, paddles, with, a, force, which, could, tear, the, windlass, or, handle, out, of, one, s, hands, or, if, one, was, standing, in, the, wrong, place, could, knock, one, into, the, canal, leading, to, injuries, and, drownings, on, the, chesapeake, and, ohio, canal, the, lockkeepers, were, required, to, remove, the, windlasses, from, all, lock, paddles, at, night, to, prevent, unauthorized, use, a, swell, was, caused, by, opening, suddenly, the, paddle, valves, in, the, lock, gates, or, when, emptying, a, lock, to, help, boats, traveling, downstream, exit, a, lock, the, locksman, would, sometimes, open, the, paddles, to, create, a, swell, which, would, help, flush, the, boat, out, of, the, lock, a, boatsman, might, ask, for, a, back, swell, that, is, to, open, and, shut, the, paddles, a, few, times, to, create, some, waves, to, help, him, get, off, the, bank, where, he, was, stuck, if, boats, ran, aground, from, being, overloaded, they, sometimes, asked, passing, crews, to, tell, the, upstream, lock, to, give, them, an, extra, heavy, swell, which, consisted, of, opening, all, the, paddles, on, the, lock, gate, creating, a, surge, that, affected, the, whole, pound, below, on, the, erie, canal, some, loaded, boats, needed, a, swell, to, get, out, of, the, lock, particularly, lumber, boats, being, top, heavy, would, list, to, one, side, and, get, stuck, in, the, lock, and, needed, a, swell, to, get, them, out, some, lockkeepers, would, give, a, swell, to, anyone, to, help, them, on, the, way, but, some, would, ask, for, money, for, the, swell, the, erie, canal, management, did, not, like, swelling, for, two, reasons, first, it, used, too, much, water, lowering, the, water, on, the, pound, above, sometimes, causing, boats, to, run, aground, in, addition, it, raised, the, water, level, on, the, pound, below, causing, some, boats, to, strike, bridges, or, get, stuck, on, horse, drawn, and, mule, drawn, canals, snubbing, posts, were, used, to, slow, or, stop, a, boat, in, the, lock, a, 200, ton, boat, moving, at, a, few, miles, an, hour, could, destroy, the, lock, gate, to, prevent, this, a, rope, was, wound, around, the, snubbing, post, as, the, boat, entered, the, lock, pulling, on, the, rope, slowed, the, boat, due, to, the, friction, of, the, rope, against, the, post, a, rope, 2, 1, 2, inches, 6, 4, cm, in, diameter, and, about, 60, feet, 18, meters, long, was, typically, used, on, the, erie, canal, to, snub, a, boat, in, a, lock, one, incident, which, took, place, in, june, 1873, on, the, chesapeake, and, ohio, canal, involved, the, boat, the, henry, c, flagg, and, its, drunk, captain, that, boat, was, already, leaking, the, crew, having, partially, pumped, the, water, out, entered, lock, 74, moving, in, front, of, another, boat, because, they, failed, to, snub, the, boat, it, crashed, into, and, knocked, out, the, downstream, gates, the, outrush, of, water, from, the, lock, caused, the, upstream, gates, to, slam, shut, breaking, them, also, and, sending, a, cascade, of, water, over, the, boat, sinking, it, this, suspended, navigation, on, the, canal, for, 48, hours, until, the, lock, gates, could, be, replaced, and, the, boat, removed, from, the, lock, to, economise, especially, where, good, stone, would, be, prohibitively, expensive, or, difficult, to, obtain, composite, locks, were, made, i, e, they, were, constructed, using, rubble, or, inferior, stone, dressing, the, inside, walls, of, the, lock, with, wood, so, as, not, to, abrade, the, boats, this, was, done, for, instance, on, the, chesapeake, and, ohio, canal, with, the, locks, near, the, paw, paw, tunnel, and, also, the, chenango, canal, on, large, modern, canals, especially, very, large, ones, such, as, ship, canals, the, gates, and, paddles, are, too, large, to, be, hand, operated, and, are, operated, by, hydraulic, or, electrical, equipment, on, the, caledonian, canal, the, lock, gates, were, operated, by, man, powered, capstans, one, connected, by, chains, to, open, the, gate, and, another, to, draw, it, closed, by, 1968, these, had, been, replaced, by, hydraulic, power, acting, through, steel, rams, the, construction, of, locks, or, weirs, and, dams, on, rivers, obstructs, the, passage, of, fish, some, fish, such, as, lampreys, trout, and, salmon, go, upstream, to, spawn, measures, such, as, a, fish, ladder, are, often, taken, to, counteract, this, navigation, locks, have, also, potential, to, be, operated, as, fishways, to, provide, increased, access, for, a, range, of, biota, locks, can, be, built, side, by, side, on, the, same, waterway, this, is, variously, called, doubling, pairing, or, twinning, the, panama, canal, has, three, sets, of, double, locks, doubling, gives, advantages, in, speed, avoiding, hold, ups, at, busy, times, and, increasing, the, chance, of, a, boat, finding, a, lock, set, in, its, favour, the, belgian, company, sbe, engineering, worked, on, this, project, there, can, also, be, water, savings, the, locks, may, be, of, different, sizes, so, that, a, small, boat, does, not, need, to, empty, a, large, lock, or, each, lock, may, be, able, to, act, as, a, side, pond, water, saving, basin, for, the, other, in, this, latter, case, the, word, used, is, usually, twinned, here, indicating, the, possibility, of, saving, water, by, synchronising, the, operation, of, the, chambers, so, that, some, water, from, the, emptying, chamber, helps, to, fill, the, other, this, facility, has, long, been, withdrawn, on, the, english, canals, although, the, disused, paddle, gear, can, sometimes, be, seen, as, at, hillmorton, on, the, oxford, canal, elsewhere, they, are, still, in, use, a, pair, of, twinned, locks, was, opened, in, 2014, on, the, dortmund, ems, canal, near, m, nster, germany, the, once, famous, staircase, at, lockport, new, york, was, also, a, doubled, set, of, locks, five, twinned, locks, allowed, east, and, west, bound, boats, to, climb, or, descend, the, 60, feet, 18, m, niagara, escarpment, a, considerable, engineering, feat, in, the, nineteenth, century, while, lockport, today, has, two, large, steel, locks, half, of, the, old, twin, stair, acts, as, an, emergency, spillway, and, can, still, be, seen, with, the, original, lock, gates, having, been, restored, in, early, 2016, loosely, a, flight, of, locks, is, simply, a, series, of, locks, in, close, enough, proximity, to, be, identified, as, a, single, group, for, many, reasons, a, flight, of, locks, is, preferable, to, the, same, number, of, locks, spread, more, widely, crews, are, put, ashore, and, picked, up, once, rather, than, multiple, times, transition, involves, a, concentrated, burst, of, effort, rather, than, a, continually, interrupted, journey, a, lock, keeper, may, be, stationed, to, help, crews, through, the, flight, quickly, and, where, water, is, in, short, supply, a, single, pump, can, recycle, water, to, the, top, of, the, whole, flight, the, need, for, a, flight, may, be, determined, purely, by, the, lie, of, the, land, but, it, is, possible, to, group, locks, purposely, into, flights, by, using, cuttings, or, embankments, to, postpone, the, height, change, examples, caen, hill, locks, devizes, flight, is, not, synonymous, with, staircase, see, below, a, set, of, locks, is, only, a, staircase, if, successive, lock, chambers, share, a, gate, i, e, do, not, have, separate, top, and, bottom, gates, with, a, pound, between, them, most, flights, are, not, staircases, because, each, chamber, is, a, separate, lock, with, its, own, upper, and, lower, gates, there, is, a, navigable, pound, however, short, between, each, pair, of, locks, and, the, locks, are, operated, in, the, conventional, way, however, some, flights, include, or, consist, entirely, of, staircases, on, the, grand, union, leicester, canal, the, watford, flight, consists, of, a, four, chamber, staircase, and, three, separate, locks, and, the, foxton, flight, consists, entirely, of, two, adjacent, 5, chamber, staircases, where, a, very, steep, gradient, has, to, be, climbed, a, lock, staircase, is, used, there, are, two, types, of, staircase, real, and, apparent, a, real, staircase, can, be, thought, of, as, a, compressed, flight, where, the, intermediate, pounds, have, disappeared, and, the, upper, gate, of, one, lock, is, also, the, lower, gate, of, the, one, above, it, however, it, is, incorrect, to, use, the, terms, staircase, and, flight, interchangeably, because, of, the, absence, of, intermediate, pounds, operating, a, staircase, is, very, different, from, operating, a, flight, it, can, be, more, useful, to, think, of, a, staircase, as, a, single, lock, with, intermediate, levels, the, top, gate, is, a, normal, top, gate, and, the, intermediate, gates, are, all, as, tall, as, the, bottom, gate, as, there, is, no, intermediate, pound, a, chamber, can, only, be, filled, by, emptying, the, one, above, or, emptied, by, filling, the, one, below, thus, the, whole, staircase, has, to, be, full, of, water, except, for, the, bottom, chamber, before, a, boat, starts, to, ascend, or, empty, except, for, the, top, chamber, before, a, boat, starts, to, descend, in, an, apparent, staircase, the, chambers, still, have, common, gates, but, the, water, does, not, pass, directly, from, one, chamber, to, the, next, going, instead, via, side, ponds, this, means, it, is, not, necessary, to, ensure, that, the, flight, is, full, or, empty, before, starting, examples, of, famous, real, staircases, in, england, are, bingley, and, grindley, brook, two, rise, staircases, are, more, common, snakeholme, lock, and, struncheon, hill, lock, on, the, driffield, navigation, were, converted, to, staircase, locks, after, low, water, levels, hindered, navigation, over, the, bottom, cill, at, all, but, the, higher, tides, the, new, bottom, chamber, rises, just, far, enough, to, get, the, boat, over, the, original, lock, cill, in, china, the, recently, completed, three, gorges, dam, includes, a, double, five, step, staircase, for, large, ships, and, a, ship, lift, for, vessels, of, less, than, 3000, metric, tons, examples, of, apparent, staircases, are, foxton, locks, and, watford, locks, on, the, leicester, branch, of, the, grand, union, operation, of, a, staircase, is, more, involved, than, a, flight, inexperienced, boaters, may, find, operating, staircase, locks, difficult, the, key, worries, apart, from, simply, being, paralysed, with, indecision, are, either, sending, down, more, water, than, the, lower, chambers, can, cope, with, flooding, the, towpath, or, sending, a, wave, along, the, canal, or, completely, emptying, an, intermediate, chamber, although, this, shows, that, a, staircase, lock, can, be, used, as, an, emergency, dry, dock, to, avoid, these, mishaps, it, is, usual, to, have, the, whole, staircase, empty, before, starting, to, descend, or, full, before, starting, to, ascend, apart, from, the, initial, chamber, one, striking, difference, in, using, a, staircase, of, either, type, compared, with, a, single, lock, or, a, flight, is, the, best, sequence, for, letting, boats, through, in, a, single, lock, or, a, flight, with, room, for, boats, to, pass, boats, should, ideally, alternate, in, direction, in, a, staircase, however, it, is, quicker, for, a, boat, to, follow, a, previous, one, going, in, the, same, direction, partly, for, this, reason, staircase, locks, such, as, grindley, brook, foxton, watford, and, bratch, are, supervised, by, lockkeepers, at, least, during, the, main, cruising, season, they, normally, try, to, alternate, as, many, boats, up, followed, by, down, as, there, are, chambers, in, the, flight, as, with, a, flight, it, is, possible, on, a, broad, canal, for, more, than, one, boat, to, be, in, a, staircase, at, the, same, time, but, managing, this, without, waste, of, water, requires, expertise, on, english, canals, a, staircase, of, more, than, two, chambers, is, usually, staffed, the, lockkeepers, at, bingley, looking, after, both, the, 5, rise, and, the, 3, rise, ensure, that, there, are, no, untoward, events, and, that, boats, are, moved, through, as, speedily, and, efficiently, as, possible, such, expertise, permits, miracles, of, boat, balletics, boats, travelling, in, opposite, directions, can, pass, each, other, halfway, up, the, staircase, by, moving, sideways, around, each, other, or, at, peak, times, one, can, have, all, the, chambers, full, simultaneously, with, boats, travelling, in, the, same, direction, when, variable, conditions, meant, that, a, higher, water, level, in, the, new, canal, could, not, be, guaranteed, then, the, older, company, would, also, build, a, stop, lock, under, its, own, control, with, gates, pointing, towards, its, own, canal, which, could, be, closed, when, the, new, canal, was, low, this, resulted, in, a, sequential, pair, of, locks, with, gates, pointing, in, opposite, directions, one, example, was, at, hall, green, near, kidsgrove, where, the, southern, terminus, of, the, macclesfield, canal, joined, the, hall, green, branch, of, the, earlier, trent, and, mersey, canal, the, four, gate, stop, lock, near, kings, norton, junction, between, the, stratford, upon, avon, canal, and, the, worcester, and, birmingham, canal, was, replaced, in, 1914, by, a, pair, of, guillotine, lock, gates, which, stopped, the, water, flow, regardless, of, which, canal, was, higher, these, gates, have, been, permanently, open, since, nationalisation, the, best, known, example, of, a, round, lock, is, the, agde, round, lock, on, the, canal, du, midi, in, france, this, serves, as, a, lock, on, the, main, line, of, the, canal, and, allows, access, to, the, h, rault, river, a, second, french, round, lock, can, be, found, in, the, form, of, the, now, disused, cluse, des, lorraines, connecting, the, canal, lat, ral, la, loire, with, the, river, allier, a, drop, lock, can, consist, of, two, conventional, lock, chambers, leading, to, a, sump, pound, or, a, single, long, chamber, incorporating, the, sump, although, the, term, properly, applies, only, to, the, second, case, as, the, pounds, at, either, end, of, the, structure, are, at, the, same, height, the, lock, can, only, be, emptied, either, by, allowing, water, to, run, to, waste, from, the, sump, to, a, lower, stream, or, drain, or, less, wastefully, by, pumping, water, back, up, to, the, canal, particularly, in, the, two, chamber, type, there, would, be, a, need, for, a, bypass, culvert, to, allow, water, to, move, along, the, interrupted, pound, and, so, supply, locks, further, down, the, canal, in, the, case, of, the, single, chamber, type, this, can, be, achieved, by, keeping, the, lock, full, and, leaving, the, gates, open, while, not, in, use, while, the, concept, has, been, suggested, in, a, number, of, cases, the, only, example, in, the, world, of, a, drop, lock, that, has, actually, been, constructed, is, at, dalmuir, on, the, forth, and, clyde, canal, in, scotland, this, lock, of, the, single, chamber, type, was, incorporated, during, the, restoration, of, the, canal, to, allow, the, replacement, of, a, swing, bridge, on, a, busy, a, road, by, a, fixed, bridge, and, so, answer, criticisms, that, the, restoration, of, the, canal, would, cause, frequent, interruptions, of, the, heavy, road, traffic, it, can, be, emptied, by, pumping, but, as, this, uses, a, lot, of, electricity, the, method, used, when, water, supplies, are, adequate, is, to, drain, the, lock, to, a, nearby, burn, in, 2016, the, kieldrecht, lock, in, the, port, of, antwerp, in, belgium, took, over, the, title, of, the, world, s, largest, lock, from, the, berendrecht, lock, in, the, same, port, and, still, has, the, title, for, largest, volume, in, 2022, the, ijmuiden, sea, lock, serving, the, port, of, amsterdam, became, the, world, s, largest, lock, by, surface, area, the, lock, is, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, long, 70, m, 230, ft, wide, and, has, sliding, lock, gates, creating, a, usable, depth, of, 18, m, 59, ft, the, size, of, locks, cannot, be, compared, without, considering, the, difference, in, water, level, that, they, are, designed, to, operate, under, for, example, the, boll, ne, lock, on, the, river, rh, ne, has, a, fall, of, at, least, 23, m, 75, ft, the, leerstetten, eckersm, hlen, and, hilpoltstein, locks, on, the, rhine, main, danube, canal, have, a, fall, of, 24, 67, m, 80, 9, ft, each, and, the, oskemen, lock, on, the, irtysh, river, in, kazakhstan, has, a, drop, of, 42, m, 138, ft, the, natural, extension, of, the, flash, lock, or, staunch, was, to, provide, an, upper, gate, or, pair, of, gates, to, form, an, intermediate, pound, which, was, all, that, need, be, emptied, when, a, boat, passed, through, this, type, of, lock, called, a, pound, lock, was, known, in, imperial, china, and, ancient, europe, and, was, used, by, greek, engineers, in, the, canal, of, the, pharaohs, under, ptolemy, ii, 284, to, 246, bc, when, engineers, solved, the, problem, of, overcoming, the, difference, in, height, through, canal, locks, pound, locks, were, first, used, in, medieval, china, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ce, the, songshi, or, history, of, the, song, dynasty, volume, 307, biography, 66, records, how, qiao, weiyue, a, high, ranking, tax, administrator, was, frustrated, at, the, frequent, losses, incurred, when, his, grain, barges, were, wrecked, on, the, west, river, near, huai, an, in, jiangsu, the, soldiers, at, one, double, slipway, he, discovered, had, plotted, with, bandits, to, wreck, heavy, imperial, barges, so, that, they, could, steal, the, spilled, grain, in, 984, qiao, installed, a, pair, of, sluice, gates, two, hundred, and, fifty, feet, apart, the, entire, structure, roofed, over, like, a, building, by, siting, two, staunch, gates, so, close, to, one, another, qiao, had, created, a, short, stretch, of, canal, effectively, a, pound, lock, filled, from, the, canal, above, by, raising, individual, wooden, baulks, in, the, top, gate, and, emptied, into, the, canal, below, by, lowering, baulks, in, the, top, gate, and, raising, ones, in, the, lower, a, turf, sided, lock, is, an, early, form, of, canal, lock, design, that, uses, earth, banks, to, form, the, lock, chamber, subsequently, attracting, grasses, and, other, vegetation, instead, of, the, now, more, familiar, and, widespread, brick, stone, or, concrete, lock, wall, constructions, this, early, lock, design, was, most, often, used, on, river, navigations, in, the, early, 18th, century, before, the, advent, of, canals, in, britain, the, sides, of, the, turf, lock, are, sloping, so, when, full, the, lock, is, quite, wide, consequently, this, type, of, lock, needs, more, water, to, operate, than, vertical, sided, brick, or, stone, walled, locks, on, british, canals, and, waterways, most, turf, sided, locks, have, been, subsequently, rebuilt, in, brick, or, stone, and, so, only, a, few, good, examples, survive, such, as, at, garston, lock, and, monkey, marsh, lock, on, the, kennet, and, avon, canal, on, english, canals, these, reservoirs, are, called, side, ponds, the, droitwich, canal, reopened, in, 2011, has, a, flight, of, three, locks, at, hanbury, which, all, have, operational, side, ponds, there, are, no, working, waterway, inclined, planes, in, the, uk, at, the, moment, but, the, remains, of, a, famous, one, can, be, seen, at, foxton, in, leicestershire, on, the, leicester, arm, of, the, grand, union, canal, the, plane, enabled, wide, beam, boats, to, bypass, the, flight, of, ten, narrow, locks, but, failure, to, make, improvements, at, the, other, end, of, the, arm, and, high, running, costs, led, to, its, early, demise, there, are, plans, to, restore, it, and, some, funding, has, been, obtained, around, 1800, the, use, of, caisson, locks, was, proposed, by, robert, weldon, for, the, somerset, coal, canal, in, england, in, this, underwater, lift, the, chamber, was, 80, ft, 24, 4, m, long, and, 60, ft, 18, 3, m, deep, and, contained, a, completely, enclosed, wooden, box, big, enough, to, take, a, barge, this, box, moved, up, and, down, in, the, 60, ft, 18, 3, m, deep, pool, of, water, apart, from, inevitable, leakage, the, water, never, left, the, chamber, and, using, the, lock, wasted, no, water, instead, the, boat, entered, the, box, and, was, sealed, in, by, the, door, closing, behind, it, and, the, box, itself, was, moved, up, or, down, through, the, water, when, the, box, was, at, the, bottom, of, the, chamber, it, was, under, almost, 60, feet, 18, 3, m, of, water, at, a, pressure, of, three, atm, 304, kpa, 44, 1, psi, in, total, one, of, these, locks, was, built, and, demonstrated, to, the, prince, regent, later, george, iv, but, it, had, various, engineering, problems, and, the, design, was, not, put, into, use, on, the, coal, canal, possibly, inspired, by, weldon, s, caisson, lock, william, congreve, in, 1813, patented, a, hydro, pneumatic, double, balance, lock, in, which, two, adjacent, locks, containing, pneumatic, caissons, could, be, raised, and, lowered, in, counterbalance, by, the, movement, of, compressed, air, from, one, caisson, to, the, other, in, about, 1817, the, regents, canal, company, built, one, of, these, locks, at, the, site, of, the, present, day, camden, lock, north, london, here, the, motivation, was, again, water, supply, problems, the, company, insisted, on, various, modifications, to, congreve, s, design, the, resulting, installation, proved, to, be, unsatisfactory, and, was, soon, replaced, by, conventional, locks, looking, superficially, similar, to, the, caisson, lock, is, the, shaft, lock, shaft, locks, consist, of, a, deep, shaft, with, conventional, upper, gates, the, lower, gates, are, reached, through, a, short, tunnel, the, gates, only, close, off, this, approach, tunnel, so, do, not, have, to, reach, the, full, height, of, the, lock, notable, examples, have, been, built, at, saint, denis, paris, france, horin, near, melnik, czech, republic, and, anderten, hannover, germany, the, shaft, lock, at, minden, 52, 18, 23, n, 8, 55, 11, e, 52, 30639, n, 8, 91972, e, 52, 30639, 8, 91972, has, a, fall, of, 12, 7, metres, 42, ft, and, has, eight, tanks, linked, in, pairs, to, the, lock, chamber, as, the, lock, is, emptied, water, is, run, into, each, chamber, in, turn, for, filling, the, water, is, released, from, the, chambers, thus, saving, the, waste, of, a, complete, lockfull, of, water, an, earlier, attempt, at, a, shaft, lock, had, been, made, at, trollh, ttan, in, sweden, on, the, line, of, the, present, g, ta, canal, the, fall, would, have, been, 16, metres, 52, ft, astonishing, in, 1749, however, the, approach, tunnel, proved, to, be, unusable, in, times, of, flood, and, the, shaft, lock, was, replaced, by, a, 2, rise, staircase, in, 1768, this, is, similar, to, a, shaft, lock, but, having, the, shaft, built, on, an, incline, boats, are, moored, to, floating, bollards, which, guide, them, along, the, shaft, as, it, fills, or, empties, the, diagonal, lock, advisory, group, has, identified, several, sites, in, britain, where, the, new, design, could, be, installed, either, on, new, waterways, or, canals, under, restoration, projects, under, consideration, include, the, restoration, of, the, lancaster, canal, to, kendal, and, the, proposed, new, branch, of, the, grand, union, canal, between, bedford, and, milton, keynes
