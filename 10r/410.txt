the, modern, combine, harvester, also, called, a, combine, is, a, machine, designed, to, harvest, a, variety, of, cultivated, seeds, combine, harvesters, are, one, of, the, most, economically, important, labour, saving, inventions, significantly, reducing, the, fraction, of, the, population, engaged, in, agriculture, among, the, crops, harvested, with, a, combine, are, wheat, rice, oats, rye, barley, corn, maize, sorghum, millet, soybeans, flax, linseed, sunflowers, and, rapeseed, the, separated, straw, consisting, of, stems, and, any, remaining, leaves, with, limited, nutrients, left, in, it, is, then, either, chopped, onto, the, field, and, ploughed, back, in, or, laid, out, in, rows, ready, to, be, baled, and, used, for, bedding, and, cattle, feed, the, name, of, the, machine, is, derived, from, the, fact, that, the, harvester, combined, multiple, separate, harvesting, operations, reaping, threshing, or, winnowing, and, gathering, into, a, single, process, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, a, combine, harvester, still, performs, those, operation, principles, the, machine, can, easily, be, divided, into, four, parts, namely, the, intake, mechanism, the, threshing, and, separation, system, the, cleaning, system, and, finally, the, grain, handling, and, storage, system, electronic, monitoring, assists, the, operator, by, providing, an, overview, of, the, machine, s, operation, and, the, field, s, yield, in, 1826, in, scotland, the, inventor, reverend, patrick, bell, designed, a, reaper, machine, which, used, the, scissors, principle, of, plant, cutting, a, principle, that, is, used, to, this, day, the, bell, machine, was, pushed, by, horses, a, few, bell, machines, were, available, in, the, united, states, in, 1835, in, the, united, states, hiram, moore, built, and, patented, the, first, combine, harvester, which, was, capable, of, reaping, threshing, and, winnowing, cereal, grain, early, versions, were, pulled, by, horse, mule, or, ox, teams, in, 1835, moore, built, a, full, scale, version, with, a, length, of, 5, 2, m, 17, ft, and, a, cut, width, of, 4, 57, m, 15, ft, by, 1839, over, 20, ha, 50, acres, of, crops, were, harvested, this, combine, harvester, was, pulled, by, 20, horses, fully, handled, by, farmhands, by, 1860, combine, harvesters, with, a, cutting, or, swathe, width, of, several, metres, were, used, on, american, farms, a, parallel, development, in, australia, saw, the, development, of, the, stripper, based, on, the, gallic, stripper, by, john, ridley, and, others, in, south, australia, by, 1843, the, stripper, only, gathered, the, heads, leaving, the, stems, in, the, field, the, stripper, and, later, headers, had, the, advantage, of, fewer, moving, parts, and, only, collecting, heads, requiring, less, power, to, operate, refinements, by, hugh, victor, mckay, produced, a, commercially, successful, combine, harvester, in, 1885, the, sunshine, header, harvester, combines, some, of, them, quite, large, were, drawn, by, mule, or, horse, teams, and, used, a, bullwheel, to, provide, power, later, steam, power, was, used, and, george, stockton, berry, integrated, the, combine, with, a, steam, engine, using, straw, to, heat, the, boiler, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, horse, drawn, combines, were, starting, to, be, used, on, the, american, plains, and, idaho, often, pulled, by, teams, of, twenty, or, more, horses, in, 1911, the, holt, manufacturing, company, of, california, us, produced, a, self, propelled, harvester, in, australia, in, 1923, the, patented, sunshine, auto, header, was, one, of, the, first, center, feeding, self, propelled, harvesters, in, 1923, in, kansas, the, baldwin, brothers, and, their, gleaner, manufacturing, company, patented, a, self, propelled, harvester, that, included, several, other, modern, improvements, in, grain, handling, both, the, gleaner, and, the, sunshine, used, fordson, engines, early, gleaners, used, the, entire, fordson, chassis, and, driveline, as, a, platform, in, 1929, alfredo, rotania, of, argentina, patented, a, self, propelled, harvester, international, harvester, started, making, horse, pulled, combines, in, 1915, at, the, time, horse, powered, binders, and, stand, alone, threshing, machines, were, more, common, in, the, 1920s, case, corporation, and, john, deere, made, combines, and, these, were, starting, to, be, tractor, pulled, with, a, second, engine, aboard, the, combine, to, power, its, workings, the, world, economic, collapse, in, the, 1930s, stopped, farm, equipment, purchases, and, for, this, reason, people, largely, retained, the, older, method, of, harvesting, a, few, farms, did, invest, and, used, caterpillar, tractors, to, move, the, outfits, tractor, drawn, combines, also, called, pull, type, combines, became, common, after, world, war, ii, as, many, farms, began, to, use, tractors, an, example, was, the, all, crop, harvester, series, these, combines, used, a, shaker, to, separate, the, grain, from, the, chaff, and, straw, walkers, grates, with, small, teeth, on, an, eccentric, shaft, to, eject, the, straw, while, retaining, the, grain, early, tractor, drawn, combines, were, usually, powered, by, a, separate, gasoline, engine, while, later, models, were, pto, powered, via, a, shaft, transferring, tractor, engine, power, to, operate, the, combine, these, machines, either, put, the, harvested, crop, into, bags, that, were, then, loaded, onto, a, wagon, or, truck, or, had, a, small, bin, that, stored, the, grain, until, it, was, transferred, via, a, chute, in, the, u, s, allis, chalmers, massey, harris, international, harvester, gleaner, manufacturing, company, john, deere, and, minneapolis, moline, are, past, or, present, major, combine, producers, in, 1937, the, australian, born, thomas, carroll, working, for, massey, harris, in, canada, perfected, a, self, propelled, model, and, in, 1940, a, lighter, weight, model, began, to, be, marketed, widely, by, the, company, lyle, yost, invented, an, auger, that, would, lift, grain, out, of, a, combine, in, 1947, making, unloading, grain, much, easier, and, further, from, the, combine, in, 1952, claeys, launched, the, first, self, propelled, combine, harvester, in, europe, in, 1953, the, european, manufacturer, claas, developed, a, self, propelled, combine, harvester, named, hercules, it, could, harvest, up, to, 5, tons, of, wheat, a, day, this, newer, kind, of, combine, is, still, in, use, and, is, powered, by, diesel, or, gasoline, engines, until, the, self, cleaning, rotary, screen, was, invented, in, the, mid, 1960s, combine, engines, suffered, from, overheating, as, the, chaff, spewed, out, when, harvesting, small, grains, would, clog, radiators, blocking, the, airflow, needed, for, cooling, a, significant, advance, in, the, design, of, combines, was, the, rotary, design, the, grain, is, initially, stripped, from, the, stalk, by, passing, along, a, helical, rotor, instead, of, passing, between, rasp, bars, on, the, outside, of, a, cylinder, and, a, concave, rotary, combines, were, first, introduced, by, sperry, new, holland, in, 1975, around, the, 1980s, on, board, electronics, were, introduced, to, measure, threshing, efficiency, this, new, instrumentation, allowed, operators, to, get, better, grain, yields, by, optimizing, ground, speed, and, other, operating, parameters, the, largest, class, 10, plus, combines, which, emerged, in, the, early, 2020, s, have, nearly, 800, engine, horsepower, 600, kw, and, are, fitted, with, headers, up, to, 60, feet, 18, m, wide, combines, are, equipped, with, removable, headers, that, are, designed, for, particular, crops, the, standard, header, sometimes, called, a, grain, platform, is, equipped, with, a, reciprocating, knife, cutter, bar, and, features, a, revolving, reel, with, metal, teeth, to, cause, the, cut, crop, to, fall, into, the, auger, once, it, is, cut, a, variation, of, the, platform, a, flex, platform, is, similar, but, has, a, cutter, bar, that, can, flex, over, contours, and, ridges, to, cut, soybeans, that, have, pods, close, to, the, ground, a, flex, head, can, cut, soybeans, as, well, as, cereal, crops, while, a, rigid, platform, is, generally, used, only, in, cereal, grains, some, wheat, headers, called, draper, headers, use, a, fabric, or, rubber, apron, instead, of, a, cross, auger, draper, headers, allow, faster, feeding, than, cross, augers, leading, to, higher, throughputs, due, to, lower, power, requirements, on, many, farms, platform, headers, are, used, to, cut, wheat, instead, of, separate, wheat, headers, so, as, to, reduce, overall, costs, dummy, heads, or, pick, up, headers, feature, spring, tined, pickups, usually, attached, to, a, heavy, rubber, belt, they, are, used, for, crops, that, have, already, been, cut, and, placed, in, windrows, or, swaths, this, is, particularly, useful, in, northern, climates, such, as, western, canada, where, swathing, kills, weeds, resulting, in, a, faster, dry, down, while, a, grain, platform, can, be, used, for, corn, a, specialized, corn, head, is, ordinarily, used, instead, the, corn, head, is, equipped, with, snap, rolls, that, strip, the, stalk, and, leaf, away, from, the, ear, so, that, only, the, ear, and, husk, enter, the, throat, this, improves, efficiency, dramatically, since, so, much, less, material, must, go, through, the, cylinder, the, corn, head, can, be, recognized, by, the, presence, of, points, between, each, row, occasionally, rowcrop, heads, are, seen, that, function, like, a, grain, platform, but, have, points, between, rows, like, a, corn, head, these, are, used, to, reduce, the, amount, of, weed, seed, picked, up, when, harvesting, small, grains, self, propelled, gleaner, combines, could, be, fitted, with, special, tracks, instead, of, tires, to, assist, in, harvesting, rice, these, tracks, can, be, made, to, fit, other, combines, by, adding, adapter, plates, some, combines, particularly, the, pull, type, have, tires, with, a, deep, diamond, tread, which, prevents, sinking, in, mud, the, cut, crop, is, carried, up, the, feeder, throat, commonly, called, the, feederhouse, by, a, chain, and, flight, elevator, then, fed, into, the, threshing, mechanism, of, the, combine, consisting, of, a, rotating, threshing, drum, commonly, called, the, cylinder, to, which, grooved, steel, bars, rasp, bars, are, bolted, the, rasp, bars, thresh, or, separate, the, grains, and, chaff, from, the, straw, through, the, action, of, the, cylinder, against, the, concave, a, shaped, half, drum, also, fitted, with, steel, bars, and, a, meshed, grill, through, which, grain, chaff, and, smaller, debris, may, fall, whereas, the, straw, being, too, long, is, carried, through, onto, the, straw, walkers, this, action, is, also, allowed, because, grain, is, heavier, than, straw, which, causes, it, to, fall, rather, than, float, across, from, the, cylinder, concave, to, the, walkers, the, drum, speed, is, variably, adjustable, on, most, machines, whilst, the, distance, between, the, drum, and, concave, is, finely, adjustable, fore, aft, and, together, to, achieve, optimum, separation, and, output, manually, engaged, disawning, plates, are, usually, fitted, to, the, concave, these, provide, extra, friction, to, remove, the, awns, from, barley, crops, after, the, primary, separation, at, the, cylinder, the, clean, grain, falls, through, the, concave, and, to, the, shoe, which, contains, the, chaffer, and, sieves, the, shoe, is, common, to, both, conventional, combines, and, rotary, combines, hillside, leveling, in, which, a, hydraulic, system, re, orients, the, combine, allows, combines, to, harvest, steep, but, fertile, soil, their, primary, advantage, is, increased, threshing, efficiency, without, leveling, grain, and, chaff, slide, to, one, side, of, separator, and, come, through, the, machine, in, a, large, ball, rather, than, being, separated, dumping, large, amounts, of, grain, on, the, ground, by, keeping, the, machinery, level, the, straw, walker, is, able, to, thresh, more, efficiently, secondarily, leveling, changes, a, combine, s, center, of, gravity, relative, to, the, hill, and, allows, the, combine, to, harvest, along, the, contour, of, a, hill, without, tipping, a, danger, on, steeper, slopes, it, is, not, uncommon, for, combines, to, roll, over, on, extremely, steep, hills, hillside, leveling, can, be, very, important, in, regions, with, steep, hills, such, as, the, palouse, region, of, the, pacific, northwest, of, the, united, states, where, hillsides, can, have, slopes, as, steep, as, 50, the, first, leveling, technology, was, developed, by, holt, co, a, us, company, in, california, in, 1891, modern, leveling, came, into, being, with, the, invention, and, patent, of, a, level, sensitive, mercury, switch, system, invented, by, raymond, alvah, hanson, in, 1946, a, leveling, system, was, also, developed, in, europe, by, the, italian, combine, manufacturer, laverda, gleaner, ih, case, ih, john, deere, and, others, all, have, made, combines, with, a, hillside, leveling, system, and, local, machine, shops, have, fabricated, them, as, an, aftermarket, add, on, newer, leveling, systems, do, not, have, as, much, tilt, as, the, older, ones, as, modern, combines, use, a, rotary, grain, separator, which, makes, leveling, less, critical, sidehill, combines, are, very, similar, to, hillside, combines, in, that, they, level, the, combine, to, the, ground, so, that, the, threshing, can, be, efficiently, conducted, however, they, have, some, very, distinct, differences, modern, hillside, combines, level, around, 35, on, average, while, older, machines, were, closer, to, 50, sidehill, combines, only, level, to, 18, they, are, sparsely, used, in, the, palouse, region, rather, they, are, used, on, the, gentle, rolling, slopes, of, the, midwest, sidehill, combines, are, much, more, mass, produced, than, their, hillside, counterparts, the, height, of, a, sidehill, machine, is, the, same, height, as, a, level, land, combine, hillside, combines, have, added, steel, that, sets, them, up, approximately, 2, 5, feet, higher, than, a, level, land, combine, and, provide, a, smooth, ride, another, technology, that, is, sometimes, used, on, combines, is, a, continuously, variable, transmission, this, allows, the, ground, speed, of, the, machine, to, be, varied, while, maintaining, a, constant, engine, and, threshing, speed, it, is, desirable, to, keep, the, threshing, speed, constant, since, the, machine, will, typically, have, been, adjusted, to, operate, best, at, a, certain, speed, self, propelled, combines, started, with, standard, manual, transmissions, that, provided, one, speed, based, on, input, rpm, deficiencies, were, noted, and, in, the, early, 1950s, combines, were, equipped, with, what, john, deere, called, the, variable, speed, drive, this, was, simply, a, variable, width, sheave, controlled, by, spring, and, hydraulic, pressures, this, sheave, was, attached, to, the, input, shaft, of, the, transmission, a, standard, 4, speed, manual, transmission, was, still, used, in, this, drive, system, the, operator, would, select, a, gear, typically, 3rd, an, extra, control, was, provided, to, the, operator, to, allow, him, to, speed, up, and, slow, down, the, machine, within, the, limits, provided, by, the, variable, speed, drive, system, by, decreasing, the, width, of, the, sheave, on, the, input, shaft, of, the, transmission, the, belt, would, ride, higher, in, the, groove, this, slowed, the, rotating, speed, on, the, input, shaft, of, the, transmission, thus, slowing, the, ground, speed, for, that, gear, a, clutch, was, still, provided, to, allow, the, operator, to, stop, the, machine, and, change, transmission, gears, later, as, hydraulic, technology, improved, hydrostatic, transmissions, were, introduced, for, use, on, swathers, but, later, this, technology, was, applied, to, combines, as, well, this, drive, retained, the, 4, speed, manual, transmission, as, before, but, used, a, system, of, hydraulic, pumps, and, motors, to, drive, the, input, shaft, of, the, transmission, the, engine, turns, the, hydraulic, pump, capable, of, pressures, up, to, 4, 000, psi, 30, mpa, this, pressure, is, then, directed, to, the, hydraulic, motor, that, is, connected, to, the, input, shaft, of, the, transmission, the, operator, is, provided, with, a, lever, in, the, cab, that, allows, for, the, control, of, the, hydraulic, motor, s, ability, to, use, the, energy, provided, by, the, pump, most, if, not, all, modern, combines, are, equipped, with, hydrostatic, drives, these, are, larger, versions, of, the, same, system, used, in, consumer, and, commercial, lawn, mowers, that, most, are, familiar, with, today, in, fact, it, was, the, downsizing, of, the, combine, drive, system, that, placed, these, drive, systems, into, mowers, and, other, machines, despite, great, advances, in, mechanics, and, computer, control, the, basic, operation, of, the, combine, harvester, has, remained, unchanged, almost, since, it, was, invented, power, requirements, over, the, years, have, increased, due, to, larger, capacities, and, some, processes, such, as, rotary, threshing, and, straw, chopping, take, considerable, power, this, is, sometimes, supplied, by, a, large, tractor, in, a, pull, type, combine, or, a, large, gasoline, or, diesel, engine, in, a, self, propelled, type, a, frequent, problem, is, the, presence, of, airborne, chaff, and, straw, which, can, accumulate, causing, a, fire, hazard, and, to, radiators, which, can, become, plugged, most, machines, have, addressed, these, problems, with, enclosed, engine, compartments, and, rotary, centrifugal, inlet, screens, which, prevent, chaff, buildup, first, the, header, described, above, cuts, the, crop, and, feeds, it, into, the, threshing, cylinder, this, consists, of, a, series, of, horizontal, rasp, bars, fixed, across, the, path, of, the, crop, and, in, the, shape, of, a, quarter, cylinder, moving, rasp, bars, or, rub, bars, pull, the, crop, through, concaved, grates, that, separate, the, grain, and, chaff, from, the, straw, the, grain, heads, fall, through, the, fixed, concaves, what, happens, next, is, dependent, on, the, type, of, combine, in, question, in, most, modern, combines, the, grain, is, transported, to, the, shoe, by, a, set, of, 2, 3, or, 4, possibly, more, on, the, largest, machines, augers, set, parallel, or, semi, parallel, to, the, rotor, on, axial, mounted, rotors, and, perpendicular, on, axial, flow, combines, in, older, gleaner, machines, these, augers, were, not, present, those, combines, are, unique, in, that, the, cylinder, and, concave, is, set, inside, feederhouse, instead, of, in, the, machine, directly, behind, the, feederhouse, consequently, the, material, was, moved, by, a, raddle, chain, from, underneath, the, concave, to, the, walkers, the, clean, grain, fell, between, the, raddle, and, the, walkers, onto, the, shoe, while, the, straw, being, longer, and, lighter, floated, across, onto, the, walkers, to, be, expelled, on, most, other, older, machines, the, cylinder, was, placed, higher, and, farther, back, in, the, machine, and, the, grain, moved, to, the, shoe, by, falling, down, a, clean, grain, pan, and, the, straw, floated, across, the, concaves, to, the, back, of, the, walkers, since, the, sperry, new, holland, tr70, twin, rotor, combine, came, out, in, 1975, most, manufacturers, have, combines, with, rotors, in, place, of, conventional, cylinders, however, makers, have, now, returned, to, the, market, with, conventional, models, alongside, their, rotary, line, up, a, rotor, is, a, long, longitudinally, mounted, rotating, cylinder, with, plates, similar, to, rub, bars, except, for, in, the, above, mentioned, gleaner, rotaries, there, are, usually, two, sieves, one, above, the, other, the, sieves, are, basically, metal, frames, that, have, many, rows, of, fingers, set, reasonably, close, together, the, angle, of, the, fingers, is, adjustable, to, change, the, clearance, and, thereby, control, the, size, of, material, passing, through, the, top, is, set, with, more, clearance, than, the, bottom, to, allow, a, gradual, cleaning, action, setting, the, concave, clearance, fan, speed, and, sieve, size, is, critical, to, ensure, that, the, crop, is, threshed, properly, the, grain, is, clean, of, debris, and, all, of, the, grain, entering, the, machine, reaches, the, grain, tank, or, hopper, observe, for, example, that, when, travelling, uphill, the, fan, speed, must, be, reduced, to, account, for, the, shallower, gradient, of, the, sieves, heavy, material, e, g, unthreshed, heads, fall, off, the, front, of, the, sieves, and, are, returned, to, the, concave, for, re, threshing, the, straw, walkers, are, located, above, the, sieves, and, also, have, holes, in, them, any, grain, remaining, attached, to, the, straw, is, shaken, off, and, falls, onto, the, top, sieve, when, the, straw, reaches, the, end, of, the, walkers, it, falls, out, the, rear, of, the, combine, it, can, then, be, baled, for, cattle, bedding, or, spread, by, two, rotating, straw, spreaders, with, rubber, arms, most, modern, combines, are, equipped, with, a, straw, spreader, rather, than, immediately, falling, out, the, rear, of, the, combine, at, the, end, of, the, walkers, there, are, models, of, combine, harvesters, from, eastern, europe, and, russia, e, g, agromash, yenisei, 1200, 1, hm, etc, that, have, straw, catchers, at, the, end, of, the, walkers, which, temporarily, hold, the, straw, and, then, once, full, deposit, it, in, a, stack, for, easy, gathering, for, some, time, combine, harvesters, used, the, conventional, design, which, used, a, rotating, cylinder, at, the, front, end, which, knocked, the, seeds, out, of, the, heads, and, then, used, the, rest, of, the, machine, to, separate, the, straw, from, the, chaff, and, the, chaff, from, the, grain, the, tr70, from, sperry, new, holland, was, brought, out, in, 1975, as, the, first, rotary, combine, other, manufacturers, soon, followed, international, harvester, with, their, axial, flow, in, 1977, and, gleaner, with, their, n6, in, 1979, in, the, decades, before, the, widespread, adoption, of, the, rotary, combine, in, the, late, seventies, several, inventors, had, pioneered, designs, which, relied, more, on, centrifugal, force, for, grain, separation, and, less, on, gravity, alone, by, the, early, eighties, most, major, manufacturers, had, settled, on, a, walkerless, design, with, much, larger, threshing, cylinders, to, do, most, of, the, work, advantages, were, faster, grain, harvesting, and, gentler, treatment, of, fragile, seeds, which, were, often, cracked, by, the, faster, rotational, speeds, of, conventional, combine, threshing, cylinders, it, was, the, disadvantages, of, the, rotary, combine, increased, power, requirements, and, over, pulverization, of, the, straw, by, product, which, prompted, a, resurgence, of, conventional, combines, in, the, late, nineties, perhaps, overlooked, but, nonetheless, true, when, the, large, engines, that, powered, the, rotary, machines, were, employed, in, conventional, machines, the, two, types, of, machines, delivered, similar, production, capacities, also, research, was, beginning, to, show, that, incorporating, above, ground, crop, residue, straw, into, the, soil, is, less, useful, for, rebuilding, soil, fertility, than, previously, believed, this, meant, that, working, pulverized, straw, into, the, soil, became, more, of, a, hindrance, than, a, benefit, an, increase, in, feedlot, beef, production, also, created, a, higher, demand, for, straw, as, fodder, conventional, combines, which, use, straw, walkers, preserve, the, quality, of, straw, and, allow, it, to, be, baled, and, removed, from, the, field, while, the, principles, of, basic, threshing, have, changed, little, over, the, years, modern, advancements, in, electronics, and, monitoring, technology, has, continued, to, develop, whereas, older, machines, required, the, operator, to, rely, on, machine, knowledge, frequent, inspection, and, monitoring, and, a, keen, ear, to, listen, for, subtle, sound, changes, newer, machines, have, replaced, many, of, those, duties, with, instrumentation, early, on, simple, magnetic, pickups, were, used, to, monitor, shaft, rotation, and, issue, a, warning, when, they, deviated, beyond, preset, limits, temperature, sensors, can, also, give, warning, when, bearings, overheat, due, to, lack, of, lubrication, sometimes, leading, to, combine, fires, the, job, of, monitoring, how, much, grain, is, wasted, by, the, thresher, by, being, discharged, with, the, chaff, and, straw, used, to, require, going, behind, the, machine, to, check, yield, monitors, work, like, a, microphone, registering, an, electrical, impulse, caused, by, grains, impacting, a, plate, a, meter, in, the, operator, s, cab, displays, the, relative, amount, of, grain, loss, proportional, to, speed, measuring, the, amount, of, yield, bushels, per, acre, or, tonnes, per, hectare, has, become, increasingly, important, particularly, when, real, time, measurement, can, help, determine, which, areas, of, a, field, are, more, or, less, productive, these, variations, can, often, be, remediated, with, variable, crop, inputs, yield, is, determined, by, measuring, the, amount, of, grain, harvested, in, relation, to, the, area, covered, cameras, placed, at, strategic, points, on, the, machine, can, eliminate, some, of, the, guesswork, for, the, operator, the, advent, of, gps, and, gis, technologies, has, made, it, possible, to, create, field, maps, which, can, assist, in, navigation, and, in, the, preparation, of, yield, maps, which, show, which, parts, of, the, field, are, more, productive, while, all, combines, aim, to, achieve, the, same, result, each, machine, can, be, classified, based, on, its, general, throughput, which, is, based, upon, the, rated, horsepower, rating, of, the, combine, currently, combine, classifications, as, defined, by, association, of, equipment, manufacturers, aem, are, as, follows, metric, horsepower, which, is, approximately, 735, 5, watts, is, used, while, this, classification, is, current, the, classes, themselves, have, and, will, evolve, over, time, for, instance, a, class, 7, combine, in, the, year, 1980, would, only, have, 270, horsepower, and, been, one, of, the, largest, machines, available, in, the, world, at, that, time, but, in, the, 21st, century, the, same, machine, would, be, considered, small, the, association, of, equipment, manufacturers, recognizes, class, 10, which, came, into, being, in, 2013, as, the, largest, combine, class, however, there, are, combines, with, horsepower, and, threshing, capacity, that, could, argue, for, creating, a, new, class, grain, combine, fires, are, responsible, for, millions, of, dollars, of, loss, each, year, fires, usually, start, near, the, engine, where, dust, and, dry, crop, debris, accumulate, fires, can, also, start, when, heat, is, introduced, by, bearings, or, gearboxes, that, have, failed, from, 1984, to, 2000, 695, major, grain, combine, fires, were, reported, to, u, s, local, fire, departments, dragging, chains, to, reduce, static, electricity, was, one, method, employed, for, preventing, harvester, fires, but, it, is, not, yet, clear, what, if, any, role, static, electricity, plays, in, causing, harvester, fires, the, application, of, appropriate, synthetic, greases, will, reduce, the, friction, experienced, at, crucial, points, i, e, chains, sprockets, and, gear, boxes, compared, to, petroleum, based, lubricants, engines, with, synthetic, lubricants, will, also, remain, significantly, cooler, during, operation, obsolete, or, damaged, combines, can, be, converted, into, general, utility, tractors, this, is, possible, if, the, relevant, systems, cabin, drivetrain, controls, and, hydraulics, still, work, or, can, be, repaired, conversions, typically, involve, removing, specialized, components, for, threshing, and, processing, crops, they, can, also, include, modifying, the, frame, and, controls, to, better, suit, operation, as, a, tractor, including, lowering, it, closer, to, the, ground, thresher, drives, can, sometimes, be, repurposed, as, power, take, offs
