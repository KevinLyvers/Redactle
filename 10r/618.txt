the, soviet, space, program, russian, romanized, kosmicheskaya, programma, sssr, was, the, state, space, program, of, the, soviet, union, active, from, 1955, until, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, contrary, to, its, american, european, and, chinese, competitors, which, had, their, programs, run, under, single, coordinating, agencies, the, soviet, space, program, was, divided, between, several, internally, competing, design, bureaus, led, by, korolev, kerimov, keldysh, yangel, glushko, chelomey, makeyev, chertok, and, reshetnev, several, of, these, bureaus, were, subordinated, to, the, ministry, of, general, machine, building, the, soviet, space, program, served, as, an, important, marker, of, claims, by, the, soviet, union, to, its, superpower, status, 1, soviet, investigations, into, rocketry, began, with, the, formation, of, the, gas, dynamics, laboratory, in, 1921, and, these, endeavors, expanded, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, both, the, soviet, and, united, states, space, programs, utilised, german, technology, in, their, early, efforts, at, space, programs, in, the, 1950s, the, soviet, program, was, formalized, under, the, management, of, sergei, korolev, who, led, the, program, based, on, unique, concepts, derived, from, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, sometimes, known, as, the, father, of, theoretical, astronautics, competing, in, the, space, race, with, the, united, states, and, later, with, the, european, union, and, with, china, the, soviet, space, program, was, notable, in, setting, many, records, in, space, exploration, including, the, first, intercontinental, missile, r, 7, semyorka, that, launched, the, first, satellite, sputnik, 1, and, sent, the, first, animal, laika, into, earth, orbit, in, 1957, and, placed, the, first, human, in, space, in, 1961, yuri, gagarin, in, addition, the, soviet, program, also, saw, the, first, woman, in, space, valentina, tereshkova, in, 1963, and, the, first, spacewalk, in, 1965, other, milestones, included, computerized, robotic, missions, exploring, the, moon, starting, in, 1959, being, the, first, to, reach, the, surface, of, the, moon, recording, the, first, image, of, the, far, side, of, the, moon, and, achieving, the, first, soft, landing, on, the, moon, the, soviet, program, also, achieved, the, first, space, rover, deployment, with, the, lunokhod, programme, in, 1966, and, sent, the, first, robotic, probe, that, automatically, extracted, a, sample, of, lunar, soil, and, brought, it, to, earth, in, 1970, luna, 16, the, soviet, program, was, also, responsible, for, leading, the, first, interplanetary, probes, to, venus, and, mars, and, made, successful, soft, landings, on, these, planets, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, it, put, the, first, space, station, salyut, 1, into, low, earth, orbit, in, 1971, and, the, first, modular, space, station, mir, in, 1986, its, interkosmos, program, was, also, notable, for, sending, the, first, citizen, of, a, country, other, than, the, united, states, or, soviet, union, into, space, the, theory, of, space, exploration, had, a, solid, basis, in, the, russian, empire, before, the, first, world, war, with, the, writings, of, the, russian, and, soviet, rocket, scientist, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, 1857, 1935, who, published, pioneering, papers, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, on, astronautic, theory, including, calculating, the, rocket, equation, and, in, 1929, introduced, the, concept, of, the, multistaged, rocket, additional, astronautic, and, spaceflight, theory, was, also, provided, by, the, ukrainian, and, soviet, engineer, and, mathematician, yuri, kondratyuk, who, developed, the, first, known, lunar, orbit, rendezvous, lor, a, key, concept, for, landing, and, return, spaceflight, from, earth, to, the, moon, the, lor, was, later, used, for, the, plotting, of, the, first, actual, human, spaceflight, to, the, moon, many, other, aspects, of, spaceflight, and, space, exploration, are, covered, in, his, works, both, theoretical, and, practical, aspects, of, spaceflight, was, also, provided, by, the, latvian, pioneer, of, rocketry, and, spaceflight, friedrich, zander, including, suggesting, in, a, 1925, paper, that, a, spacecraft, traveling, between, two, planets, could, be, accelerated, at, the, beginning, of, its, trajectory, and, decelerated, at, the, end, of, its, trajectory, by, using, the, gravity, of, the, two, planets, moons, a, method, known, as, gravity, assist, the, first, soviet, development, of, rockets, was, in, 1921, when, the, soviet, military, sanctioned, the, commencement, of, a, small, research, laboratory, to, explore, solid, fuel, rockets, led, by, nikolai, tikhomirov, a, chemical, engineer, and, supported, by, vladimir, artemyev, a, soviet, engineer, tikhomirov, had, commenced, studying, solid, and, liquid, fueled, rockets, in, 1894, and, in, 1915, he, lodged, a, patent, for, self, propelled, aerial, and, water, surface, mines, in, 1928, the, laboratory, was, renamed, the, gas, dynamics, laboratory, gdl, the, first, test, firing, of, a, solid, fuel, rocket, was, carried, out, in, march, 1928, which, flew, for, about, 1, 300, meters, further, developments, in, the, early, 1930s, were, led, by, georgy, langemak, and, 1932, in, air, test, firings, of, rs, 82, missiles, from, an, tupolev, i, 4, aircraft, armed, with, six, launchers, successfully, took, place, a, key, contributor, to, early, soviet, efforts, came, from, a, young, russian, aircraft, engineer, sergey, korolev, who, would, later, become, the, de, facto, head, of, the, soviet, space, programme, in, 1926, as, an, advanced, student, korolev, was, mentored, by, the, famous, soviet, aircraft, designer, andrey, tupolev, who, was, a, professor, at, his, university, in, 1930, while, working, as, a, lead, engineer, on, the, tupolev, tb, 3, heavy, bomber, he, became, interested, in, the, possibilities, of, liquid, fueled, rocket, engines, to, propel, airplanes, this, led, to, contact, with, zander, and, sparked, his, interest, in, space, exploration, and, rocketry, practical, aspects, built, on, early, experiments, carried, out, by, members, of, the, group, for, the, study, of, reactive, motion, better, known, by, its, russian, acronym, gird, in, the, 1930s, where, zander, korolev, and, other, pioneers, such, as, the, russian, engineers, mikhail, tikhonravov, leonid, dushkin, vladimir, vetchinkin, and, yuriy, pobedonostsev, worked, together, on, august, 18, 1933, the, leningrad, branch, of, gird, led, by, tikhonravov, launched, the, first, hybrid, propellant, rocket, the, gird, 09, and, on, november, 25, 1933, the, soviet, s, first, liquid, fueled, rocket, gird, x, in, 1933, gird, was, merged, with, gdl, by, the, soviet, government, to, form, the, reactive, scientific, research, institute, rnii, which, brought, together, the, best, of, the, soviet, rocket, talent, including, korolev, langemak, ivan, kleymyonov, and, former, gdl, engine, designer, valentin, glushko, early, success, of, rnii, included, the, conception, in, 1936, and, first, flight, in, 1941, of, the, rp, 318, the, soviets, first, rocket, powered, aircraft, and, the, rs, 82, and, rs, 132, missiles, entered, service, by, 1937, which, became, the, basis, for, development, in, 1938, and, serial, production, from, 1940, to, 1941, of, the, katyusha, multiple, rocket, launcher, another, advance, in, the, reactive, propulsion, field, rnii, s, research, and, development, were, very, important, for, later, achievements, of, the, soviet, rocket, and, space, programs, during, the, 1930s, soviet, rocket, technology, was, comparable, to, germany, s, but, joseph, stalin, s, great, purge, severely, damaged, its, progress, in, november, 1937, kleymyonov, and, langemak, were, arrested, and, later, executed, glushko, and, many, other, leading, engineers, were, imprisoned, in, the, gulag, korolev, was, arrested, in, june, 1938, and, sent, to, a, forced, labour, camp, in, kolyma, in, june, 1939, however, due, to, intervention, by, tupolev, he, was, relocated, to, a, prison, for, scientists, and, engineers, in, september, 1940, during, world, war, ii, rocketry, efforts, were, carried, out, by, three, soviet, design, bureaus, rnii, continued, to, develop, and, improve, solid, fuel, rockets, including, the, rs, 82, and, rs, 132, missiles, and, the, katyusha, rocket, launcher, where, pobedonostsev, and, tikhonravov, continued, to, work, on, rocket, design, in, 1944, rnii, was, renamed, scientific, research, institute, no, 1, nii, i, and, combined, with, design, bureau, okb, 293, led, by, soviet, engineer, viktor, bolkhovitinov, which, developed, with, aleksei, isaev, boris, chertok, leonid, voskresensky, and, nikolay, pilyugin, a, short, range, rocket, powered, interceptor, called, bereznyak, isayev, bi, 1, special, design, bureau, for, special, engines, okb, sd, was, led, by, glushko, and, focused, on, developing, auxiliary, liquid, fueled, rocket, engines, to, assist, takeoff, and, climbing, of, prop, aircraft, including, the, rd, ikhz, rd, 2, and, rd, 3, in, 1944, the, rd, 1, khz, auxiliary, rocket, motor, was, tested, in, a, fast, climb, lavochkin, la, 7r, for, protection, of, the, capital, from, high, altitude, luftwaffe, attacks, in, 1942, korolev, was, transferred, to, okb, sd, where, he, proposed, development, of, the, long, range, missiles, d, 1, and, d, 2, the, third, design, bureau, was, plant, no, 51, okb, 51, led, by, soviet, ukrainian, engineer, vladimir, chelomey, where, he, created, the, first, soviet, pulsating, air, jet, engine, in, 1942, independently, of, similar, contemporary, developments, in, nazi, germany, during, world, war, ii, nazi, germany, developed, rocket, technology, that, was, more, advanced, than, the, allies, and, a, race, commenced, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, to, capture, and, exploit, the, technology, soviet, rocket, specialist, was, sent, to, germany, in, 1945, to, obtain, v, 2, rockets, and, worked, with, german, specialists, in, germany, and, later, in, the, soviet, union, to, understand, and, replicate, the, rocket, technology, the, involvement, of, german, scientists, and, engineers, was, an, essential, catalyst, to, early, soviet, efforts, in, 1945, and, 1946, the, use, of, german, expertise, was, invaluable, in, reducing, the, time, needed, to, master, the, intricacies, of, the, v, 2, rocket, establishing, production, of, the, r, 1, rocket, and, enable, a, base, for, further, developments, on, 22, october, 1946, 302, german, rocket, scientists, and, engineers, including, 198, from, the, zentralwerke, a, total, of, 495, persons, including, family, members, were, deported, to, the, soviet, union, as, part, of, operation, osoaviakhim, however, after, 1947, the, soviets, made, very, little, use, of, german, specialists, and, their, influence, on, the, future, soviet, rocket, program, was, marginal, the, soviet, space, program, was, tied, to, the, ussr, s, five, year, plans, and, from, the, start, was, reliant, on, support, from, the, soviet, military, although, he, was, single, mindedly, driven, by, the, dream, of, space, travel, korolev, generally, kept, this, a, secret, while, working, on, military, projects, especially, after, the, soviet, union, s, first, atomic, bomb, test, in, 1949, a, missile, capable, of, carrying, a, nuclear, warhead, to, the, united, states, as, many, mocked, the, idea, of, launching, satellites, and, crewed, spacecraft, nonetheless, the, first, soviet, rocket, with, animals, aboard, launched, in, july, 1951, the, two, dogs, were, recovered, alive, after, reaching, 101, km, in, altitude, two, months, ahead, of, america, s, first, such, achievement, this, and, subsequent, flights, gave, the, soviets, valuable, experience, with, space, medicine, 84, 88, 95, 96, 118, because, of, its, global, range, and, large, payload, of, approximately, five, tons, the, reliable, r, 7, was, not, only, effective, as, a, strategic, delivery, system, for, nuclear, warheads, but, also, as, an, excellent, basis, for, a, space, vehicle, the, united, states, announcement, in, july, 1955, of, its, plan, to, launch, a, satellite, during, the, international, geophysical, year, greatly, benefited, korolev, in, persuading, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, to, support, his, plans, 148, 151, in, a, letter, addressed, to, khrushchev, korolev, stressed, the, necessity, of, launching, a, simple, satellite, in, order, to, compete, with, the, american, space, effort, plans, were, approved, for, earth, orbiting, satellites, sputnik, to, gain, knowledge, of, space, and, four, uncrewed, military, reconnaissance, satellites, zenit, further, planned, developments, called, for, a, crewed, earth, orbit, flight, by, and, an, uncrewed, lunar, mission, at, an, earlier, date, after, the, first, sputnik, proved, to, be, a, successful, propaganda, coup, korolev, now, known, publicly, only, as, the, anonymous, chief, designer, of, rocket, space, systems, 168, 169, was, charged, to, accelerate, the, crewed, program, the, design, of, which, was, combined, with, the, zenit, program, to, produce, the, vostok, spacecraft, after, sputnik, soviet, scientists, and, program, leaders, envisioned, establishing, a, crewed, station, to, study, the, effects, of, zero, gravity, and, the, long, term, effects, on, lifeforms, in, a, space, environment, still, influenced, by, tsiolkovsky, who, had, chosen, mars, as, the, most, important, goal, for, space, travel, in, the, early, 1960s, the, soviet, program, under, korolev, created, substantial, plans, for, crewed, trips, to, mars, as, early, as, 1968, to, 1970, with, closed, loop, life, support, systems, and, electrical, rocket, engines, and, launched, from, large, orbiting, space, stations, these, plans, were, much, more, ambitious, than, america, s, goal, of, landing, on, the, moon, 333, 337, the, soviet, space, program, was, secondary, in, military, funding, to, the, strategic, rocket, forces, icbms, while, the, west, believed, that, khrushchev, personally, ordered, each, new, space, mission, for, propaganda, purposes, and, the, soviet, leader, did, have, an, unusually, close, relationship, with, korolev, and, other, chief, designers, khrushchev, emphasized, missiles, rather, than, space, exploration, and, was, not, very, interested, in, competing, with, apollo, 351, 408, 426, 427, while, the, government, and, the, communist, party, used, the, program, s, successes, as, propaganda, tools, after, they, occurred, systematic, plans, for, missions, based, on, political, reasons, were, rare, one, exception, being, valentina, tereshkova, the, first, woman, in, space, on, vostok, 6, in, 1963, 351, missions, were, planned, based, on, rocket, availability, or, ad, hoc, reasons, rather, than, scientific, purposes, for, example, the, government, in, february, 1962, abruptly, ordered, an, ambitious, mission, involving, two, vostoks, simultaneously, in, orbit, launched, in, ten, days, time, to, eclipse, john, glenn, s, mercury, atlas, 6, that, month, the, program, could, not, do, so, until, august, with, vostok, 3, and, vostok, 4, 354, 361, unlike, the, american, space, program, which, had, nasa, as, a, single, coordinating, structure, directed, by, its, administrator, james, webb, through, most, of, the, 1960s, the, ussr, s, program, was, split, between, several, competing, design, groups, despite, the, remarkable, successes, of, the, sputnik, program, between, 1957, and, 1961, and, vostok, program, between, 1961, and, 1964, after, 1958, korolev, s, okb, 1, design, bureau, faced, increasing, competition, from, his, rival, chief, designers, mikhail, yangel, valentin, glushko, and, vladimir, chelomei, korolev, planned, to, move, forward, with, the, soyuz, craft, and, n, 1, heavy, booster, that, would, be, the, basis, of, a, permanent, crewed, space, station, and, crewed, exploration, of, the, moon, however, dmitry, ustinov, directed, him, to, focus, on, near, earth, missions, using, the, voskhod, spacecraft, a, modified, vostok, as, well, as, on, uncrewed, missions, to, nearby, planets, venus, and, mars, yangel, had, been, korolev, s, assistant, but, with, the, support, of, the, military, he, was, given, his, own, design, bureau, in, 1954, to, work, primarily, on, the, military, space, program, this, had, the, stronger, rocket, engine, design, team, including, the, use, of, hypergolic, fuels, but, following, the, nedelin, catastrophe, in, 1960, yangel, was, directed, to, concentrate, on, icbm, development, he, also, continued, to, develop, his, own, heavy, booster, designs, similar, to, korolev, s, n, 1, both, for, military, applications, and, for, cargo, flights, into, space, to, build, future, space, stations, glushko, was, the, chief, rocket, engine, designer, but, he, had, a, personal, friction, with, korolev, and, refused, to, develop, the, large, single, chamber, cryogenic, engines, that, korolev, needed, to, build, heavy, boosters, chelomey, benefited, from, the, patronage, of, khrushchev, 418, and, in, 1960, was, given, the, plum, job, of, developing, a, rocket, to, send, a, crewed, vehicle, around, the, moon, and, a, crewed, military, space, station, with, limited, space, experience, his, development, was, slow, the, progress, of, the, apollo, program, alarmed, the, chief, designers, who, each, advocated, for, his, own, program, as, the, response, multiple, overlapping, designs, received, approval, and, new, proposals, threatened, already, approved, projects, due, to, korolev, s, singular, persistence, in, august, 1964, more, than, three, years, after, the, united, states, declared, its, intentions, the, soviet, union, finally, decided, to, compete, for, the, moon, it, set, the, goal, of, a, lunar, landing, in, 1967, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, or, 1968, 406, 408, 420, at, one, stage, in, the, early, 1960s, the, soviet, space, program, was, actively, developing, multiple, launchers, and, spacecraft, with, the, fall, of, krushchev, in, 1964, korolev, was, given, complete, control, of, the, crewed, program, in, 1961, valentin, bondarenko, a, cosmonaut, training, for, a, crewed, vostok, mission, was, killed, in, an, endurance, experiment, after, the, chamber, he, was, in, caught, on, fire, the, soviet, union, chose, to, cover, up, his, death, and, continue, on, with, the, space, program, korolev, died, in, january, 1966, from, complications, of, heart, disease, and, severe, hemorrhaging, following, a, routine, operation, that, uncovered, colon, cancer, kerim, kerimov, who, had, previously, served, as, the, head, of, the, strategic, rocket, forces, and, had, participated, in, the, state, commission, for, vostok, as, part, of, his, duties, was, appointed, chairman, of, the, state, commission, on, piloted, flights, and, headed, it, for, the, next, 25, years, 1966, 1991, he, supervised, every, stage, of, development, and, operation, of, both, crewed, space, complexes, as, well, as, uncrewed, interplanetary, stations, for, the, former, soviet, union, one, of, kerimov, s, greatest, achievements, was, the, launch, of, mir, in, 1986, the, leadership, of, the, okb, 1, design, bureau, was, given, to, vasily, mishin, who, had, the, task, of, sending, a, human, around, the, moon, in, 1967, and, landing, a, human, on, it, in, 1968, mishin, lacked, korolev, s, political, authority, and, still, faced, competition, from, other, chief, designers, under, pressure, mishin, approved, the, launch, of, the, soyuz, 1, flight, in, 1967, even, though, the, craft, had, never, been, successfully, tested, on, an, uncrewed, flight, the, mission, launched, with, known, design, problems, and, ended, with, the, vehicle, crashing, to, the, ground, killing, vladimir, komarov, this, was, the, first, in, flight, fatality, of, any, space, program, following, this, tragedy, and, under, new, pressures, mishin, developed, a, drinking, problem, the, soviets, were, beaten, in, sending, the, first, crewed, flight, around, the, moon, in, 1968, by, apollo, 8, but, mishin, pressed, ahead, with, development, of, the, flawed, super, heavy, n1, in, the, hope, that, the, americans, would, have, a, setback, leaving, enough, time, to, make, the, n1, workable, and, land, a, man, on, the, moon, first, there, was, a, success, with, the, joint, flight, of, soyuz, 4, and, soyuz, 5, in, january, 1969, that, tested, the, rendezvous, docking, and, crew, transfer, techniques, that, would, be, used, for, the, landing, and, the, lk, lander, was, tested, successfully, in, earth, orbit, but, after, four, uncrewed, test, launches, of, the, n1, ended, in, failure, the, program, was, suspended, for, two, years, and, then, cancelled, removing, any, chance, of, the, soviets, landing, men, on, the, moon, before, the, united, states, besides, the, crewed, landings, the, abandoned, soviet, moon, program, included, the, multipurpose, moon, base, zvezda, first, detailed, with, developed, mockups, of, expedition, vehicles, and, surface, modules, following, this, setback, chelomey, convinced, ustinov, to, approve, a, program, in, 1970, to, advance, his, almaz, military, space, station, as, a, means, of, beating, the, us, s, announced, skylab, mishin, remained, in, control, of, the, project, that, became, salyut, but, the, decision, backed, by, mishin, to, fly, a, three, man, crew, without, pressure, suits, rather, than, a, two, man, crew, with, suits, to, salyut, 1, in, 1971, proved, fatal, when, the, re, entry, capsule, depressurized, killing, the, crew, on, their, return, to, earth, mishin, was, removed, from, many, projects, with, chelomey, regaining, control, of, salyut, after, working, with, nasa, on, the, apollo, soyuz, the, soviet, leadership, decided, a, new, management, approach, was, needed, and, in, 1974, the, n1, was, canceled, and, mishin, was, out, of, office, the, design, bureau, was, renamed, npo, energia, with, glushko, as, chief, designer, in, contrast, with, the, difficulty, faced, in, its, early, crewed, lunar, programs, the, ussr, found, significant, success, with, its, remote, moon, operations, achieving, two, historical, firsts, with, the, automatic, lunokhod, and, the, luna, sample, return, missions, the, mars, probe, program, was, also, continued, with, some, success, while, the, explorations, of, venus, and, then, of, the, halley, comet, by, the, venera, and, vega, probe, programs, were, more, effective, in, spite, of, many, other, soviet, allied, nations, contributing, to, the, national, space, program, the, soviet, program, was, mostly, inherited, by, the, russian, federation, and, fewer, facilities, to, ukraine, after, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, primary, spaceport, baikonur, cosmodrome, is, now, in, kazakhstan, which, leases, the, facility, to, russia, the, soviet, space, program, had, withheld, information, on, its, projects, predating, the, success, of, sputnik, the, world, s, first, artificial, satellite, in, fact, when, the, sputnik, project, was, first, approved, one, of, the, most, immediate, courses, of, action, the, politburo, took, was, to, consider, what, to, announce, to, the, world, regarding, their, event, the, telegraph, agency, of, the, soviet, union, tass, established, precedents, for, all, official, announcements, on, the, soviet, space, program, the, information, eventually, released, did, not, offer, details, on, who, built, and, launched, the, satellite, or, why, it, was, launched, the, public, release, revealed, there, is, an, abundance, of, arcane, scientific, and, technical, data, as, if, to, overwhelm, the, reader, with, mathematics, in, the, absence, of, even, a, picture, of, the, object, what, remains, of, the, release, is, the, pride, for, soviet, cosmonautics, and, the, vague, hinting, of, future, possibilities, then, available, after, sputnik, s, success, the, soviet, space, program, s, use, of, secrecy, served, as, both, a, tool, to, prevent, the, leaking, of, classified, information, between, countries, and, also, to, create, a, mysterious, barrier, between, the, space, program, and, the, soviet, populace, the, program, s, nature, embodied, ambiguous, messages, concerning, its, goals, successes, and, values, launchings, were, not, announced, until, they, took, place, cosmonaut, names, were, not, released, until, they, flew, mission, details, were, sparse, outside, observers, did, not, know, the, size, or, shape, of, their, rockets, or, cabins, or, most, of, their, spaceships, except, for, the, first, sputniks, lunar, probes, and, venus, probe, however, the, military, influence, over, the, soviet, space, program, may, be, the, best, explanation, for, this, secrecy, the, okb, 1, was, subordinated, under, the, ministry, of, general, machine, building, tasked, with, the, development, of, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, and, continued, to, give, its, assets, random, identifiers, into, the, 1960s, for, example, the, vostok, spacecraft, was, referred, to, as, object, iif63, while, its, launch, rocket, was, object, 8k72k, soviet, defense, factories, had, been, assigned, numbers, rather, than, names, since, 1927, even, these, internal, codes, were, obfuscated, in, public, employees, used, a, separate, code, a, set, of, special, post, office, numbers, to, refer, to, the, factories, institutes, and, departments, the, program, s, public, pronouncements, were, uniformly, positive, as, far, as, the, people, knew, the, soviet, space, program, had, never, experienced, failure, according, to, historian, james, andrews, with, almost, no, exceptions, coverage, of, soviet, space, exploits, especially, in, the, case, of, human, space, missions, omitted, reports, of, failure, or, trouble, according, to, dominic, phelan, in, the, book, cold, war, space, sleuths, the, ussr, was, famously, described, by, winston, churchill, as, a, riddle, wrapped, in, a, mystery, inside, an, enigma, and, nothing, signified, this, more, than, the, search, for, the, truth, behind, its, space, program, during, the, cold, war, although, the, space, race, was, literally, played, out, above, our, heads, it, was, often, obscured, by, a, figurative, space, curtain, that, took, much, effort, to, see, through, the, soviet, space, program, s, projects, include, two, days, after, the, united, states, announced, its, intention, to, launch, an, artificial, satellite, on, july, 31, 1955, the, soviet, union, announced, its, intention, to, do, the, same, sputnik, 1, was, launched, on, october, 4, 1957, beating, the, united, states, and, stunning, people, all, over, the, world, the, soviet, space, program, pioneered, many, aspects, of, space, exploration, the, soviet, space, program, experienced, a, number, of, fatal, incidents, and, failures, the, first, official, cosmonaut, fatality, during, training, occurred, on, march, 23, 1961, when, valentin, bondarenko, died, in, a, fire, within, a, low, pressure, high, oxygen, atmosphere, on, april, 23, 1967, soyuz, 1, crashed, into, the, ground, at, 90, mph, 140, km, h, due, to, a, parachute, failure, killing, vladimir, komarov, komarov, s, death, was, the, first, in, flight, fatality, in, the, history, of, spaceflight, the, soviets, continued, striving, for, the, first, lunar, mission, with, the, huge, n, 1, rocket, which, exploded, on, each, of, four, uncrewed, tests, shortly, after, launch, the, americans, won, the, race, to, land, men, on, the, moon, with, apollo, 11, on, july, 20, 1969, in, 1971, the, soyuz, 11, mission, to, stay, at, the, salyut, 1, space, station, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, three, cosmonauts, when, the, reentry, capsule, depressurized, during, preparations, for, reentry, this, accident, resulted, in, the, only, human, casualties, to, occur, in, space, beyond, 100, km, 62, mi, as, opposed, to, the, high, atmosphere, the, crew, members, aboard, soyuz, 11, were, vladislav, volkov, georgy, dobrovolsky, and, viktor, patsayev, on, april, 5, 1975, soyuz, 7k, t, no, 39, the, second, stage, of, a, soyuz, rocket, carrying, two, cosmonauts, to, the, salyut, 4, space, station, malfunctioned, resulting, in, the, first, crewed, launch, abort, the, cosmonauts, were, carried, several, thousand, miles, downrange, and, became, worried, that, they, would, land, in, china, which, the, soviet, union, was, having, difficult, relations, with, at, the, time, the, capsule, hit, a, mountain, sliding, down, a, slope, and, almost, slid, off, a, cliff, however, the, parachute, lines, snagged, on, trees, and, kept, this, from, happening, as, it, was, the, two, suffered, severe, injuries, and, the, commander, lazarev, never, flew, again, on, march, 18, 1980, a, vostok, rocket, exploded, on, its, launch, pad, during, a, fueling, operation, killing, 48, people, in, august, 1981, kosmos, 434, which, had, been, launched, in, 1971, was, about, to, re, enter, to, allay, fears, that, the, spacecraft, carried, nuclear, materials, a, spokesperson, from, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, of, the, ussr, assured, the, australian, government, on, 26, august, 1981, that, the, satellite, was, an, experimental, lunar, cabin, this, was, one, of, the, first, admissions, by, the, soviet, union, that, it, had, ever, engaged, in, a, crewed, lunar, spaceflight, program, 736, in, september, 1983, a, soyuz, rocket, being, launched, to, carry, cosmonauts, to, the, salyut, 7, space, station, exploded, on, the, pad, causing, the, soyuz, capsule, s, abort, system, to, engage, saving, the, two, cosmonauts, on, board, the, soviet, buran, program, attempted, to, produce, a, class, of, spaceplanes, launched, from, the, energia, rocket, in, response, to, the, us, space, shuttle, it, was, intended, to, operate, in, support, of, large, space, based, military, platforms, as, a, response, to, the, strategic, defense, initiative, buran, only, had, orbital, maneuvering, engines, unlike, the, space, shuttle, buran, did, not, fire, engines, during, launch, instead, relying, entirely, on, energia, to, lift, it, out, of, the, atmosphere, it, copied, the, airframe, and, thermal, protection, system, design, of, the, us, space, shuttle, orbiter, with, a, maximum, payload, of, 30, metric, tons, slightly, higher, than, that, of, the, space, shuttle, and, weighed, less, it, also, had, the, capability, to, land, autonomously, due, to, this, some, retroactively, consider, it, to, be, the, more, capable, launch, vehicle, by, the, time, the, system, was, ready, to, fly, in, orbit, in, 1988, strategic, arms, reduction, treaties, made, buran, redundant, on, november, 15, 1988, buran, and, its, energia, rocket, were, launched, from, baikonur, cosmodrome, in, kazakhstan, and, after, two, orbits, in, three, hours, glided, to, a, landing, a, few, miles, from, its, launch, pad, while, the, craft, survived, that, re, entry, the, heat, shield, was, not, reusable, this, failure, resulted, from, united, states, counter, intelligence, efforts, after, this, test, flight, the, soviet, ministry, of, defense, would, defund, the, program, considering, it, relatively, pointless, compared, to, its, price, the, polyus, satellite, was, a, prototype, orbital, weapons, platform, designed, to, destroy, strategic, defense, initiative, satellites, with, a, megawatt, carbon, dioxide, laser, launched, mounted, upside, down, on, its, energia, rocket, its, single, flight, test, was, a, failure, when, the, inertial, guidance, system, failed, to, rotate, it, 180, and, instead, rotated, a, complete, 360, the, energia, was, a, successfully, developed, super, heavy, lift, launch, vehicle, which, burned, liquid, hydrogen, fuel, but, without, the, buran, or, polyus, payloads, to, launch, it, was, also, canceled, due, to, lack, of, funding, on, dissolution, of, the, ussr, the, vesta, mission, would, have, consisted, of, two, identical, double, purposed, interplanetary, probes, to, be, launched, in, 1991, it, was, intended, to, fly, by, mars, instead, of, an, early, plan, to, venus, and, then, study, four, asteroids, belonging, to, different, classes, at, 4, vesta, a, penetrator, would, be, released, the, tsiolkovsky, mission, was, planned, as, a, double, purposed, deep, interplanetary, probe, to, be, launched, in, the, 1990s, to, make, a, sling, shot, flyby, of, jupiter, and, then, pass, within, five, or, seven, radii, of, the, sun, a, derivative, of, this, spacecraft, would, possibly, be, launched, toward, saturn, and, beyond
