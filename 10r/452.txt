radio, is, the, technology, of, communicating, using, radio, waves, radio, waves, are, electromagnetic, waves, of, frequency, between, 3, hertz, hz, and, 300, gigahertz, ghz, they, are, generated, by, an, electronic, device, called, a, transmitter, connected, to, an, antenna, which, radiates, oscillating, electrical, energy, often, characterized, as, a, wave, they, can, be, received, by, other, antennas, connected, to, a, radio, receiver, this, is, the, fundamental, principle, of, radio, communication, in, addition, to, communication, radio, is, used, for, radar, radio, navigation, remote, control, remote, sensing, and, other, applications, in, radio, communication, used, in, radio, and, television, broadcasting, cell, phones, two, way, radios, wireless, networking, and, satellite, communication, among, numerous, other, uses, radio, waves, are, used, to, carry, information, across, space, from, a, transmitter, to, a, receiver, by, modulating, the, radio, signal, impressing, an, information, signal, on, the, radio, wave, by, varying, some, aspect, of, the, wave, in, the, transmitter, in, radar, used, to, locate, and, track, objects, like, aircraft, ships, spacecraft, and, missiles, a, beam, of, radio, waves, emitted, by, a, radar, transmitter, reflects, off, the, target, object, and, the, reflected, waves, reveal, the, object, s, location, to, a, receiver, that, is, typically, colocated, with, the, transmitter, in, radio, navigation, systems, such, as, gps, and, vor, a, mobile, navigation, instrument, receives, radio, signals, from, multiple, navigational, radio, beacons, whose, position, is, known, and, by, precisely, measuring, the, arrival, time, of, the, radio, waves, the, receiver, can, calculate, its, position, on, earth, in, wireless, radio, remote, control, devices, like, drones, garage, door, openers, and, keyless, entry, systems, radio, signals, transmitted, from, a, controller, device, control, the, actions, of, a, remote, device, the, existence, of, radio, waves, was, first, proven, by, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, on, 11, november, 1886, in, the, mid, 1890s, building, on, techniques, physicists, were, using, to, study, electromagnetic, waves, guglielmo, marconi, developed, the, first, apparatus, for, long, distance, radio, communication, sending, a, wireless, morse, code, message, to, a, recipient, over, a, kilometer, away, in, 1895, and, the, first, transatlantic, signal, on, 12, december, 1901, the, first, commercial, radio, broadcast, was, transmitted, on, 2, november, 1920, when, the, live, returns, of, the, harding, cox, presidential, election, were, broadcast, by, westinghouse, electric, and, manufacturing, company, in, pittsburgh, under, the, call, sign, kdka, the, emission, of, radio, waves, is, regulated, by, law, coordinated, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, which, allocates, frequency, bands, in, the, radio, spectrum, for, various, uses, the, word, radio, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, radius, meaning, spoke, of, a, wheel, beam, of, light, ray, it, was, first, applied, to, communications, in, 1881, when, at, the, suggestion, of, french, scientist, ernest, mercadier, alexander, graham, bell, adopted, radiophone, meaning, radiated, sound, as, an, alternate, name, for, his, photophone, optical, transmission, system, following, hertz, s, discovery, of, the, existence, of, radio, waves, in, 1886, the, term, hertzian, waves, was, initially, used, for, this, radiation, the, first, practical, radio, communication, systems, developed, by, marconi, in, 1894, 1895, transmitted, telegraph, signals, by, radio, waves, so, radio, communication, was, first, called, wireless, telegraphy, up, until, about, 1910, the, term, wireless, telegraphy, also, included, a, variety, of, other, experimental, systems, for, transmitting, telegraph, signals, without, wires, including, electrostatic, induction, electromagnetic, induction, and, aquatic, and, earth, conduction, so, there, was, a, need, for, a, more, precise, term, referring, exclusively, to, electromagnetic, radiation, the, french, physicist, douard, branly, who, in, 1890, developed, the, radio, wave, detecting, coherer, called, it, in, french, a, radio, conducteur, the, radio, prefix, was, later, used, to, form, additional, descriptive, compound, and, hyphenated, words, especially, in, europe, for, example, in, early, 1898, the, british, publication, the, practical, engineer, included, a, reference, to, the, radiotelegraph, and, radiotelegraphy, the, use, of, radio, as, a, standalone, word, dates, back, to, at, least, 30, december, 1904, when, instructions, issued, by, the, british, post, office, for, transmitting, telegrams, specified, that, the, word, radio, is, sent, in, the, service, instructions, this, practice, was, universally, adopted, and, the, word, radio, introduced, internationally, by, the, 1906, berlin, radiotelegraphic, convention, which, included, a, service, regulation, specifying, that, radiotelegrams, shall, show, in, the, preamble, that, the, service, is, radio, the, switch, to, radio, in, place, of, wireless, took, place, slowly, and, unevenly, in, the, english, speaking, world, lee, de, forest, helped, popularize, the, new, word, in, the, united, states, in, early, 1907, he, founded, the, deforest, radio, telephone, company, and, his, letter, in, the, 22, june, 1907, electrical, world, about, the, need, for, legal, restrictions, warned, that, radio, chaos, will, certainly, be, the, result, until, such, stringent, regulation, is, enforced, the, united, states, navy, would, also, play, a, role, although, its, translation, of, the, 1906, berlin, convention, used, the, terms, wireless, telegraph, and, wireless, telegram, by, 1912, it, began, to, promote, the, use, of, radio, instead, the, term, started, to, become, preferred, by, the, general, public, in, the, 1920s, with, the, introduction, of, broadcasting, electromagnetic, waves, were, predicted, by, james, clerk, maxwell, in, his, 1873, theory, of, electromagnetism, now, called, maxwell, s, equations, who, proposed, that, a, coupled, oscillating, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, could, travel, through, space, as, a, wave, and, proposed, that, light, consisted, of, electromagnetic, waves, of, short, wavelength, on, 11, november, 1886, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, attempting, to, confirm, maxwell, s, theory, first, observed, radio, waves, he, generated, using, a, primitive, spark, gap, transmitter, experiments, by, hertz, and, physicists, jagadish, chandra, bose, oliver, lodge, lord, rayleigh, and, augusto, righi, among, others, showed, that, radio, waves, like, light, demonstrated, reflection, refraction, diffraction, polarization, standing, waves, and, traveled, at, the, same, speed, as, light, confirming, that, both, light, and, radio, waves, were, electromagnetic, waves, differing, only, in, frequency, in, 1895, guglielmo, marconi, developed, the, first, radio, communication, system, using, a, spark, gap, transmitter, to, send, morse, code, over, long, distances, by, december, 1901, he, had, transmitted, across, the, atlantic, ocean, marconi, and, karl, ferdinand, braun, shared, the, 1909, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, contributions, to, the, development, of, wireless, telegraphy, during, radio, s, first, two, decades, called, the, radiotelegraphy, era, the, primitive, radio, transmitters, could, only, transmit, pulses, of, radio, waves, not, the, continuous, waves, which, were, needed, for, audio, modulation, so, radio, was, used, for, person, to, person, commercial, diplomatic, and, military, text, messaging, starting, around, 1908, industrial, countries, built, worldwide, networks, of, powerful, transoceanic, transmitters, to, exchange, telegram, traffic, between, continents, and, communicate, with, their, colonies, and, naval, fleets, during, world, war, i, the, development, of, continuous, wave, radio, transmitters, rectifying, electrolytic, and, crystal, radio, receiver, detectors, enabled, amplitude, modulation, am, radiotelephony, to, be, achieved, by, reginald, fessenden, and, others, allowing, audio, to, be, transmitted, on, 2, november, 1920, the, first, commercial, radio, broadcast, was, transmitted, by, westinghouse, electric, and, manufacturing, company, in, pittsburgh, under, the, call, sign, kdka, featuring, live, coverage, of, the, harding, cox, presidential, election, radio, waves, are, radiated, by, electric, charges, undergoing, acceleration, they, are, generated, artificially, by, time, varying, electric, currents, consisting, of, electrons, flowing, back, and, forth, in, a, metal, conductor, called, an, antenna, as, they, travel, farther, from, the, transmitting, antenna, radio, waves, spread, out, so, their, signal, strength, intensity, in, watts, per, square, meter, decreases, see, inverse, square, law, so, radio, transmissions, can, only, be, received, within, a, limited, range, of, the, transmitter, the, distance, depending, on, the, transmitter, power, the, antenna, radiation, pattern, receiver, sensitivity, background, noise, level, and, presence, of, obstructions, between, transmitter, and, receiver, an, omnidirectional, antenna, transmits, or, receives, radio, waves, in, all, directions, while, a, directional, antenna, transmits, radio, waves, in, a, beam, in, a, particular, direction, or, receives, waves, from, only, one, direction, radio, waves, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, the, other, types, of, electromagnetic, waves, besides, radio, waves, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, can, also, carry, information, and, be, used, for, communication, the, wide, use, of, radio, waves, for, telecommunication, is, mainly, due, to, their, desirable, propagation, properties, stemming, from, their, large, wavelength, in, radio, communication, systems, information, is, carried, across, space, using, radio, waves, at, the, sending, end, the, information, to, be, sent, is, converted, by, some, type, of, transducer, to, a, time, varying, electrical, signal, called, the, modulation, signal, the, modulation, signal, may, be, an, audio, signal, representing, sound, from, a, microphone, a, video, signal, representing, moving, images, from, a, video, camera, or, a, digital, signal, consisting, of, a, sequence, of, bits, representing, binary, data, from, a, computer, the, modulation, signal, is, applied, to, a, radio, transmitter, in, the, transmitter, an, electronic, oscillator, generates, an, alternating, current, oscillating, at, a, radio, frequency, called, the, carrier, wave, because, it, serves, to, carry, the, information, through, the, air, the, information, signal, is, used, to, modulate, the, carrier, varying, some, aspect, of, the, carrier, wave, impressing, the, information, on, the, carrier, different, radio, systems, use, different, modulation, methods, many, other, types, of, modulation, are, also, used, in, some, types, a, carrier, wave, is, not, transmitted, but, just, one, or, both, modulation, sidebands, the, modulated, carrier, is, amplified, in, the, transmitter, and, applied, to, a, transmitting, antenna, which, radiates, the, energy, as, radio, waves, the, radio, waves, carry, the, information, to, the, receiver, location, at, the, receiver, the, radio, wave, induces, a, tiny, oscillating, voltage, in, the, receiving, antenna, which, is, a, weaker, replica, of, the, current, in, the, transmitting, antenna, this, voltage, is, applied, to, the, radio, receiver, which, amplifies, the, weak, radio, signal, so, it, is, stronger, then, demodulates, it, extracting, the, original, modulation, signal, from, the, modulated, carrier, wave, the, modulation, signal, is, converted, by, a, transducer, back, to, a, human, usable, form, an, audio, signal, is, converted, to, sound, waves, by, a, loudspeaker, or, earphones, a, video, signal, is, converted, to, images, by, a, display, while, a, digital, signal, is, applied, to, a, computer, or, microprocessor, which, interacts, with, human, users, the, radio, waves, from, many, transmitters, pass, through, the, air, simultaneously, without, interfering, with, each, other, because, each, transmitter, s, radio, waves, oscillate, at, a, different, rate, in, other, words, each, transmitter, has, a, different, frequency, measured, in, hertz, hz, kilohertz, khz, megahertz, mhz, or, gigahertz, ghz, the, receiving, antenna, typically, picks, up, the, radio, signals, of, many, transmitters, the, receiver, uses, tuned, circuits, to, select, the, radio, signal, desired, out, of, all, the, signals, picked, up, by, the, antenna, and, reject, the, others, a, tuned, circuit, also, called, resonant, circuit, or, tank, circuit, acts, like, a, resonator, similar, to, a, tuning, fork, it, has, a, natural, resonant, frequency, at, which, it, oscillates, the, resonant, frequency, of, the, receiver, s, tuned, circuit, is, adjusted, by, the, user, to, the, frequency, of, the, desired, radio, station, this, is, called, tuning, the, oscillating, radio, signal, from, the, desired, station, causes, the, tuned, circuit, to, resonate, oscillate, in, sympathy, and, it, passes, the, signal, on, to, the, rest, of, the, receiver, radio, signals, at, other, frequencies, are, blocked, by, the, tuned, circuit, and, not, passed, on, a, modulated, radio, wave, carrying, an, information, signal, occupies, a, range, of, frequencies, the, information, modulation, in, a, radio, signal, is, usually, concentrated, in, narrow, frequency, bands, called, sidebands, sb, just, above, and, below, the, carrier, frequency, the, width, in, hertz, of, the, frequency, range, that, the, radio, signal, occupies, the, highest, frequency, minus, the, lowest, frequency, is, called, its, bandwidth, bw, for, any, given, signal, to, noise, ratio, an, amount, of, bandwidth, can, carry, the, same, amount, of, information, data, rate, in, bits, per, second, regardless, of, where, in, the, radio, frequency, spectrum, it, is, located, so, bandwidth, is, a, measure, of, information, carrying, capacity, the, bandwidth, required, by, a, radio, transmission, depends, on, the, data, rate, of, the, information, modulation, signal, being, sent, and, the, spectral, efficiency, of, the, modulation, method, used, how, much, data, it, can, transmit, in, each, kilohertz, of, bandwidth, different, types, of, information, signals, carried, by, radio, have, different, data, rates, for, example, a, television, video, signal, has, a, greater, data, rate, than, an, audio, signal, the, radio, spectrum, the, total, range, of, radio, frequencies, that, can, be, used, for, communication, in, a, given, area, is, a, limited, resource, each, radio, transmission, occupies, a, portion, of, the, total, bandwidth, available, radio, bandwidth, is, regarded, as, an, economic, good, which, has, a, monetary, cost, and, is, in, increasing, demand, in, some, parts, of, the, radio, spectrum, the, right, to, use, a, frequency, band, or, even, a, single, radio, channel, is, bought, and, sold, for, millions, of, dollars, so, there, is, an, incentive, to, employ, technology, to, minimize, the, bandwidth, used, by, radio, services, a, slow, transition, from, analog, to, digital, radio, transmission, technologies, began, in, the, late, 1990s, part, of, the, reason, for, this, is, that, digital, modulation, can, often, transmit, more, information, a, greater, data, rate, in, a, given, bandwidth, than, analog, modulation, by, using, data, compression, algorithms, which, reduce, redundancy, in, the, data, to, be, sent, and, more, efficient, modulation, other, reasons, for, the, transition, is, that, digital, modulation, has, greater, noise, immunity, than, analog, digital, signal, processing, chips, have, more, power, and, flexibility, than, analog, circuits, and, a, wide, variety, of, types, of, information, can, be, transmitted, using, the, same, digital, modulation, because, it, is, a, fixed, resource, which, is, in, demand, by, an, increasing, number, of, users, the, radio, spectrum, has, become, increasingly, congested, in, recent, decades, and, the, need, to, use, it, more, effectively, is, driving, many, additional, radio, innovations, such, as, trunked, radio, systems, spread, spectrum, ultra, wideband, transmission, frequency, reuse, dynamic, spectrum, management, frequency, pooling, and, cognitive, radio, the, itu, arbitrarily, divides, the, radio, spectrum, into, 12, bands, each, beginning, at, a, wavelength, which, is, a, power, of, ten, 10, n, metres, with, corresponding, frequency, of, 3, times, a, power, of, ten, and, each, covering, a, decade, of, frequency, or, wavelength, each, of, these, bands, has, a, traditional, name, it, can, be, seen, that, the, bandwidth, the, range, of, frequencies, contained, in, each, band, is, not, equal, but, increases, exponentially, as, the, frequency, increases, each, band, contains, ten, times, the, bandwidth, of, the, preceding, band, the, term, tremendously, low, frequency, tlf, has, been, used, for, wavelengths, from, 1, 3, hz, 300, 000, 100, 000, km, though, the, term, has, not, been, defined, by, the, itu, the, airwaves, are, a, resource, shared, by, many, users, two, radio, transmitters, in, the, same, area, that, attempt, to, transmit, on, the, same, frequency, will, interfere, with, each, other, causing, garbled, reception, so, neither, transmission, may, be, received, clearly, interference, with, radio, transmissions, can, not, only, have, a, large, economic, cost, but, it, can, also, be, life, threatening, for, example, in, the, case, of, interference, with, emergency, communications, or, air, traffic, control, to, prevent, interference, between, different, users, the, emission, of, radio, waves, is, strictly, regulated, by, national, laws, coordinated, by, an, international, body, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, which, allocates, bands, in, the, radio, spectrum, for, different, uses, radio, transmitters, must, be, licensed, by, governments, under, a, variety, of, license, classes, depending, on, use, and, are, restricted, to, certain, frequencies, and, power, levels, in, some, classes, such, as, radio, and, television, broadcasting, stations, the, transmitter, is, given, a, unique, identifier, consisting, of, a, string, of, letters, and, numbers, called, a, call, sign, which, must, be, used, in, all, transmissions, in, order, to, adjust, maintain, or, internally, repair, radiotelephone, transmitters, individuals, must, hold, a, government, license, such, as, the, general, radiotelephone, operator, license, in, the, us, obtained, by, taking, a, test, demonstrating, adequate, technical, and, legal, knowledge, of, safe, radio, operation, exceptions, to, the, above, rules, allow, the, unlicensed, operation, by, the, public, of, low, power, short, range, transmitters, in, consumer, products, such, as, cell, phones, cordless, phones, wireless, devices, walkie, talkies, citizens, band, radios, wireless, microphones, garage, door, openers, and, baby, monitors, in, the, us, these, fall, under, part, 15, of, the, federal, communications, commission, fcc, regulations, many, of, these, devices, use, the, ism, bands, a, series, of, frequency, bands, throughout, the, radio, spectrum, reserved, for, unlicensed, use, although, they, can, be, operated, without, a, license, like, all, radio, equipment, these, devices, generally, must, be, type, approved, before, the, sale, below, are, some, of, the, most, important, uses, of, radio, organized, by, function, broadcasting, is, the, one, way, transmission, of, information, from, a, transmitter, to, receivers, belonging, to, a, public, audience, since, the, radio, waves, become, weaker, with, distance, a, broadcasting, station, can, only, be, received, within, a, limited, distance, of, its, transmitter, systems, that, broadcast, from, satellites, can, generally, be, received, over, an, entire, country, or, continent, older, terrestrial, radio, and, television, are, paid, for, by, commercial, advertising, or, governments, in, subscription, systems, like, satellite, television, and, satellite, radio, the, customer, pays, a, monthly, fee, in, these, systems, the, radio, signal, is, encrypted, and, can, only, be, decrypted, by, the, receiver, which, is, controlled, by, the, company, and, can, be, deactivated, if, the, customer, does, not, pay, broadcasting, uses, several, parts, of, the, radio, spectrum, depending, on, the, type, of, signals, transmitted, and, the, desired, target, audience, longwave, and, medium, wave, signals, can, give, reliable, coverage, of, areas, several, hundred, kilometers, across, but, have, a, more, limited, information, carrying, capacity, and, so, work, best, with, audio, signals, speech, and, music, and, the, sound, quality, can, be, degraded, by, radio, noise, from, natural, and, artificial, sources, the, shortwave, bands, have, a, greater, potential, range, but, are, more, subject, to, interference, by, distant, stations, and, varying, atmospheric, conditions, that, affect, reception, in, the, very, high, frequency, band, greater, than, 30, megahertz, the, earth, s, atmosphere, has, less, of, an, effect, on, the, range, of, signals, and, line, of, sight, propagation, becomes, the, principal, mode, these, higher, frequencies, permit, the, great, bandwidth, required, for, television, broadcasting, since, natural, and, artificial, noise, sources, are, less, present, at, these, frequencies, high, quality, audio, transmission, is, possible, using, frequency, modulation, radio, broadcasting, means, transmission, of, audio, sound, to, radio, receivers, belonging, to, a, public, audience, analog, audio, is, the, earliest, form, of, radio, broadcast, am, broadcasting, began, around, 1920, fm, broadcasting, was, introduced, in, the, late, 1930s, with, improved, fidelity, a, broadcast, radio, receiver, is, called, a, radio, most, radios, can, receive, both, am, and, fm, television, broadcasting, is, the, transmission, of, moving, images, by, radio, which, consist, of, sequences, of, still, images, which, are, displayed, on, a, screen, on, a, television, receiver, a, television, or, tv, along, with, a, synchronized, audio, sound, channel, television, video, signals, occupy, a, wider, bandwidth, than, broadcast, radio, audio, signals, analog, television, the, original, television, technology, required, 6, mhz, so, the, television, frequency, bands, are, divided, into, 6, mhz, channels, now, called, rf, channels, the, current, television, standard, introduced, beginning, in, 2006, is, a, digital, format, called, high, definition, television, hdtv, which, transmits, pictures, at, higher, resolution, typically, 1080, pixels, high, by, 1920, pixels, wide, at, a, rate, of, 25, or, 30, frames, per, second, digital, television, dtv, transmission, systems, which, replaced, older, analog, television, in, a, transition, beginning, in, 2006, use, image, compression, and, high, efficiency, digital, modulation, such, as, ofdm, and, 8vsb, to, transmit, hdtv, video, within, a, smaller, bandwidth, than, the, old, analog, channels, saving, scarce, radio, spectrum, space, therefore, each, of, the, 6, mhz, analog, rf, channels, now, carries, up, to, 7, dtv, channels, these, are, called, virtual, channels, digital, television, receivers, have, different, behavior, in, the, presence, of, poor, reception, or, noise, than, analog, television, called, the, digital, cliff, effect, unlike, analog, television, in, which, increasingly, poor, reception, causes, the, picture, quality, to, gradually, degrade, in, digital, television, picture, quality, is, not, affected, by, poor, reception, until, at, a, certain, point, the, receiver, stops, working, and, the, screen, goes, black, government, standard, frequency, and, time, signal, services, operate, time, radio, stations, which, continuously, broadcast, extremely, accurate, time, signals, produced, by, atomic, clocks, as, a, reference, to, synchronize, other, clocks, examples, are, bpc, dcf77, jjy, msf, rtz, tdf, wwv, and, yvto, one, use, is, in, radio, clocks, and, watches, which, include, an, automated, receiver, that, periodically, usually, weekly, receives, and, decodes, the, time, signal, and, resets, the, watch, s, internal, quartz, clock, to, the, correct, time, thus, allowing, a, small, watch, or, desk, clock, to, have, the, same, accuracy, as, an, atomic, clock, government, time, stations, are, declining, in, number, because, gps, satellites, and, the, internet, network, time, protocol, ntp, provide, equally, accurate, time, standards, a, two, way, radio, is, an, audio, transceiver, a, receiver, and, transmitter, in, the, same, device, used, for, bidirectional, person, to, person, voice, communication, with, other, users, with, similar, radios, an, older, term, for, this, mode, of, communication, is, radiotelephony, the, radio, link, may, be, half, duplex, as, in, a, walkie, talkie, using, a, single, radio, channel, in, which, only, one, radio, can, transmit, at, a, time, so, different, users, take, turns, talking, pressing, a, push, to, talk, button, on, their, radio, which, switches, off, the, receiver, and, switches, on, the, transmitter, or, the, radio, link, may, be, full, duplex, a, bidirectional, link, using, two, radio, channels, so, both, people, can, talk, at, the, same, time, as, in, a, cell, phone, one, way, unidirectional, radio, transmission, is, called, simplex, this, is, radio, communication, between, a, spacecraft, and, an, earth, based, ground, station, or, another, spacecraft, communication, with, spacecraft, involves, the, longest, transmission, distances, of, any, radio, links, up, to, billions, of, kilometers, for, interplanetary, spacecraft, in, order, to, receive, the, weak, signals, from, distant, spacecraft, satellite, ground, stations, use, large, parabolic, dish, antennas, up, to, 25, metres, 82, ft, in, diameter, and, extremely, sensitive, receivers, high, frequencies, in, the, microwave, band, are, used, since, microwaves, pass, through, the, ionosphere, without, refraction, and, at, microwave, frequencies, the, high, gain, antennas, needed, to, focus, the, radio, energy, into, a, narrow, beam, pointed, at, the, receiver, are, small, and, take, up, a, minimum, of, space, in, a, satellite, portions, of, the, uhf, l, c, s, k, u, and, k, a, band, are, allocated, for, space, communication, a, radio, link, that, transmits, data, from, the, earth, s, surface, to, a, spacecraft, is, called, an, uplink, while, a, link, that, transmits, data, from, the, spacecraft, to, the, ground, is, called, a, downlink, radar, is, a, radiolocation, method, used, to, locate, and, track, aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, ships, vehicles, and, also, to, map, weather, patterns, and, terrain, a, radar, set, consists, of, a, transmitter, and, receiver, the, transmitter, emits, a, narrow, beam, of, radio, waves, which, is, swept, around, the, surrounding, space, when, the, beam, strikes, a, target, object, radio, waves, are, reflected, back, to, the, receiver, the, direction, of, the, beam, reveals, the, object, s, location, since, radio, waves, travel, at, a, constant, speed, close, to, the, speed, of, light, by, measuring, the, brief, time, delay, between, the, outgoing, pulse, and, the, received, echo, the, range, to, the, target, can, be, calculated, the, targets, are, often, displayed, graphically, on, a, map, display, called, a, radar, screen, doppler, radar, can, measure, a, moving, object, s, velocity, by, measuring, the, change, in, frequency, of, the, return, radio, waves, due, to, the, doppler, effect, radar, sets, mainly, use, high, frequencies, in, the, microwave, bands, because, these, frequencies, create, strong, reflections, from, objects, the, size, of, vehicles, and, can, be, focused, into, narrow, beams, with, compact, antennas, parabolic, dish, antennas, are, widely, used, in, most, radars, the, transmitting, antenna, also, serves, as, the, receiving, antenna, this, is, called, a, monostatic, radar, a, radar, which, uses, separate, transmitting, and, receiving, antennas, is, called, a, bistatic, radar, radiolocation, is, a, generic, term, covering, a, variety, of, techniques, that, use, radio, waves, to, find, the, location, of, objects, or, for, navigation, radio, remote, control, is, the, use, of, electronic, control, signals, sent, by, radio, waves, from, a, transmitter, to, control, the, actions, of, a, device, at, a, remote, location, remote, control, systems, may, also, include, telemetry, channels, in, the, other, direction, used, to, transmit, real, time, information, on, the, state, of, the, device, back, to, the, control, station, uncrewed, spacecraft, are, an, example, of, remote, controlled, machines, controlled, by, commands, transmitted, by, satellite, ground, stations, most, handheld, remote, controls, used, to, control, consumer, electronics, products, like, televisions, or, dvd, players, actually, operate, by, infrared, light, rather, than, radio, waves, so, are, not, examples, of, radio, remote, control, a, security, concern, with, remote, control, systems, is, spoofing, in, which, an, unauthorized, person, transmits, an, imitation, of, the, control, signal, to, take, control, of, the, device, examples, of, radio, remote, control, radio, jamming, is, the, deliberate, radiation, of, radio, signals, designed, to, interfere, with, the, reception, of, other, radio, signals, jamming, devices, are, called, signal, suppressors, or, interference, generators, or, just, jammers, during, wartime, militaries, use, jamming, to, interfere, with, enemies, tactical, radio, communication, since, radio, waves, can, pass, beyond, national, borders, some, totalitarian, countries, which, practice, censorship, use, jamming, to, prevent, their, citizens, from, listening, to, broadcasts, from, radio, stations, in, other, countries, jamming, is, usually, accomplished, by, a, powerful, transmitter, which, generates, noise, on, the, same, frequency, as, the, target, transmitter, us, federal, law, prohibits, the, nonmilitary, operation, or, sale, of, any, type, of, jamming, devices, including, ones, that, interfere, with, gps, cellular, wi, fi, and, police, radars, elf, 3, hz, 100, mm, 30, hz, 10, mm, slf, 30, hz, 10, mm, 300, hz, 1, mm, ulf, 300, hz, 1, mm, 3, khz, 100, km, vlf, 3, khz,
