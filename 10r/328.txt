a, reservoir, r, z, r, v, w, r, from, french, r, servoir, is, an, enlarged, lake, behind, a, dam, usually, built, to, store, fresh, water, often, doubling, for, hydroelectric, power, generation, reservoirs, are, created, by, controlling, a, watercourse, that, drains, an, existing, body, of, water, interrupting, a, watercourse, to, form, an, embayment, within, it, excavating, or, building, any, number, of, retaining, walls, or, levees, to, enclose, any, area, to, store, water, the, term, is, also, used, technically, to, refer, to, certain, forms, of, liquid, storage, such, the, coolant, reservoir, that, captures, overflow, of, coolant, in, an, automobile, s, cooling, system, dammed, reservoirs, are, artificial, lakes, created, and, controlled, by, a, dam, constructed, across, a, valley, and, rely, on, the, natural, topography, to, provide, most, of, the, basin, of, the, reservoir, these, reservoirs, can, either, be, on, stream, reservoirs, which, are, located, on, the, original, streambed, of, the, downstream, river, and, are, filled, by, creeks, rivers, or, rainwater, that, runs, off, the, surrounding, forested, catchments, or, off, stream, reservoirs, which, receive, diverted, water, from, a, nearby, stream, or, aqueduct, or, pipeline, water, from, other, on, stream, reservoirs, dams, are, typically, located, at, a, narrow, part, of, a, downstream, of, a, natural, basin, the, valley, sides, act, as, natural, walls, with, the, dam, located, at, the, narrowest, practical, point, to, provide, strength, and, the, lowest, cost, of, construction, in, many, reservoir, construction, projects, people, have, to, be, moved, and, re, housed, historical, artifacts, moved, or, rare, environments, relocated, examples, include, the, temples, of, abu, simbel, which, were, moved, before, the, construction, of, the, aswan, dam, to, create, lake, nasser, from, the, nile, in, egypt, the, relocation, of, the, village, of, capel, celyn, during, the, construction, of, llyn, celyn, and, the, relocation, of, borgo, san, pietro, of, petrella, salto, during, the, construction, of, lake, salto, construction, of, a, dammed, reservoir, will, usually, require, the, river, to, be, diverted, during, part, of, the, build, often, through, a, temporary, tunnel, or, by, pass, channel, in, hilly, regions, reservoirs, are, often, constructed, by, enlarging, existing, lakes, sometimes, in, such, reservoirs, the, new, top, water, level, exceeds, the, watershed, height, on, one, or, more, of, the, feeder, streams, such, as, at, llyn, clywedog, in, mid, wales, in, such, cases, additional, side, dams, are, required, to, contain, the, reservoir, where, the, topography, is, poorly, suited, to, forming, a, single, large, reservoir, a, number, of, smaller, reservoirs, may, be, constructed, in, a, chain, as, in, the, river, taff, valley, where, the, llwyn, on, cantref, and, beacons, reservoirs, form, a, chain, up, the, valley, coastal, reservoirs, are, fresh, water, storage, reservoirs, located, on, the, sea, coast, near, a, river, mouth, to, store, the, flood, water, of, a, river, as, the, land, based, reservoir, construction, is, fraught, with, substantial, land, submergence, coastal, reservoirs, are, preferred, economically, and, technically, since, they, do, not, use, scarce, land, area, many, coastal, reservoirs, were, constructed, in, asia, and, europe, saemanguem, in, south, korea, marina, barrage, in, singapore, qingcaosha, in, china, and, plover, cove, in, hong, kong, are, a, few, such, coastal, reservoirs, where, water, is, pumped, or, siphoned, from, a, river, of, variable, quality, or, size, bank, side, reservoirs, may, be, built, to, store, the, water, such, reservoirs, are, usually, formed, partly, by, excavation, and, partly, by, building, a, complete, encircling, bund, or, embankment, which, may, exceed, 6, km, 4, miles, in, circumference, both, the, floor, of, the, reservoir, and, the, bund, must, have, an, impermeable, lining, or, core, initially, these, were, often, made, of, puddled, clay, but, this, has, generally, been, superseded, by, the, modern, use, of, rolled, clay, the, water, stored, in, such, reservoirs, may, stay, there, for, several, months, during, which, time, normal, biological, processes, may, substantially, reduce, many, contaminants, and, reduce, turbidity, the, use, of, bank, side, reservoirs, also, allows, water, abstraction, to, be, stopped, for, some, time, for, instance, when, the, river, is, unacceptably, polluted, or, when, flow, conditions, are, very, low, due, to, drought, the, london, water, supply, system, exhibits, one, example, of, the, use, of, bank, side, storage, here, water, is, taken, from, the, river, thames, and, river, lee, into, several, large, thames, side, reservoirs, such, as, queen, mary, reservoir, that, can, be, seen, along, the, approach, to, london, heathrow, airport, service, reservoirs, store, fully, treated, potable, water, close, to, the, point, of, distribution, many, service, reservoirs, are, constructed, as, water, towers, often, as, elevated, structures, on, concrete, pillars, where, the, landscape, is, relatively, flat, other, service, reservoirs, can, be, storage, pools, water, tanks, or, sometimes, entirely, underground, cisterns, especially, in, more, hilly, or, mountainous, country, modern, reserviors, will, often, use, geomembrane, liners, on, their, base, to, limit, seepage, and, or, as, floating, covers, to, limit, evaporation, particularly, in, arid, climates, in, the, united, kingdom, thames, water, has, many, underground, reservoirs, built, in, the, 1800s, most, of, which, are, lined, with, brick, a, good, example, is, the, honor, oak, reservoir, in, london, constructed, between, 1901, and, 1909, when, it, was, completed, it, was, said, to, be, the, largest, brick, built, underground, reservoir, in, the, world, and, it, is, still, one, of, the, largest, in, europe, this, reservoir, now, forms, part, of, the, southern, extension, of, the, thames, water, ring, main, the, top, of, the, reservoir, has, been, grassed, over, and, is, now, used, by, the, aquarius, golf, club, service, reservoirs, perform, several, functions, including, ensuring, sufficient, head, of, water, in, the, water, distribution, system, and, providing, water, capacity, to, even, out, peak, demand, from, consumers, enabling, the, treatment, plant, to, run, at, optimum, efficiency, large, service, reservoirs, can, also, be, managed, to, reduce, the, cost, of, pumping, by, refilling, the, reservoir, at, times, of, day, when, energy, costs, are, low, an, irrigation, reservoir, is, a, water, reservoir, for, agricultural, use, they, are, filled, using, pumped, groundwater, pumped, river, water, or, water, runoff, and, are, typically, used, during, the, local, dry, season, this, type, of, infrastructure, has, sparked, an, opposition, movement, in, france, with, numerous, disputes, and, for, some, projects, protests, especially, in, the, former, poitou, charentes, region, where, violent, demonstrations, took, place, in, 2022, and, 2023, in, spain, there, is, greater, acceptance, because, all, beneficiary, users, are, involved, in, the, implementation, of, the, system, the, specific, debate, about, substitution, reservoirs, is, part, of, a, broader, discussion, related, to, reservoirs, used, for, agricultural, irrigation, regardless, of, their, type, and, a, certain, model, of, intensive, agriculture, opponents, view, these, reservoirs, as, a, monopolization, of, resources, benefiting, only, a, few, representing, an, outdated, model, of, productive, agriculture, they, argue, that, these, reservoirs, lead, to, a, loss, in, both, quantity, and, quality, of, water, necessary, for, maintaining, ecological, balance, and, pose, a, risk, of, increasing, severity, and, duration, of, droughts, due, to, climate, change, in, summary, they, consider, it, a, misadaptation, to, climate, change, proponents, of, reservoirs, or, substitution, reserves, on, the, other, hand, see, them, as, a, solution, for, sustainable, agriculture, while, waiting, for, a, truly, durable, agricultural, model, without, such, reserves, they, fear, that, unsustainable, imported, irrigation, will, be, inevitable, they, believe, that, these, reservoirs, should, be, accompanied, by, a, territorial, project, that, unites, all, water, stakeholders, with, the, goal, of, preserving, and, enhancing, natural, environments, two, main, types, of, reservoirs, can, be, distinguished, based, on, their, mode, of, supply, circa, 3000, bc, the, craters, of, extinct, volcanoes, in, arabia, were, used, as, reservoirs, by, farmers, for, their, irrigation, water, dry, climate, and, water, scarcity, in, india, led, to, early, development, of, stepwells, and, other, water, resource, management, techniques, including, the, building, of, a, reservoir, at, girnar, in, 3000, bc, artificial, lakes, dating, to, the, 5th, century, bc, have, been, found, in, ancient, greece, the, artificial, bhojsagar, lake, in, present, day, madhya, pradesh, state, of, india, constructed, in, the, 11th, century, covered, 650, square, kilometres, 250, sq, mi, the, kingdom, of, kush, invented, the, hafir, a, type, of, reservoir, during, the, meroitic, period, 800, ancient, and, modern, hafirs, have, been, registered, in, the, meroitic, town, of, butana, the, hafirs, catch, the, water, during, rainy, seasons, in, order, to, ensure, water, is, available, for, several, months, during, dry, seasons, to, supply, drinking, water, irrigate, fields, and, water, cattle, the, great, reservoir, near, the, lion, temple, in, musawwarat, es, sufra, is, a, notable, hafir, in, kush, in, sri, lanka, large, reservoirs, were, created, by, ancient, sinhalese, kings, in, order, to, store, water, for, irrigation, the, famous, sri, lankan, king, par, kramab, hu, i, of, sri, lanka, said, do, not, let, a, drop, of, water, seep, into, the, ocean, without, benefiting, mankind, he, created, the, reservoir, named, parakrama, samudra, sea, of, king, parakrama, vast, artificial, reservoirs, were, also, built, by, various, ancient, kingdoms, in, bengal, assam, and, cambodia, many, dammed, river, reservoirs, and, most, bank, side, reservoirs, are, used, to, provide, the, raw, water, feed, to, a, water, treatment, plant, which, delivers, drinking, water, through, water, mains, the, reservoir, does, not, merely, hold, water, until, it, is, needed, it, can, also, be, the, first, part, of, the, water, treatment, process, the, time, the, water, is, held, before, it, is, released, is, known, as, the, retention, time, this, is, a, design, feature, that, allows, particles, and, silts, to, settle, out, as, well, as, time, for, natural, biological, treatment, using, algae, bacteria, and, zooplankton, that, naturally, live, in, the, water, however, natural, limnological, processes, in, temperate, climate, lakes, produce, temperature, stratification, in, the, water, which, tends, to, partition, some, elements, such, as, manganese, and, phosphorus, into, deep, cold, anoxic, water, during, the, summer, months, in, the, autumn, and, winter, the, lake, becomes, fully, mixed, again, during, drought, conditions, it, is, sometimes, necessary, to, draw, down, the, cold, bottom, water, and, the, elevated, levels, of, manganese, in, particular, can, cause, problems, in, water, treatment, plants, in, 2005, about, 25, of, the, world, s, 33, 105, large, dams, over, 15, metres, in, height, were, used, for, hydroelectricity, the, u, s, produces, 3, of, its, electricity, from, 80, 000, dams, of, all, sizes, an, initiative, is, underway, to, retrofit, more, dams, as, a, good, use, of, existing, infrastructure, to, provide, many, smaller, communities, with, a, reliable, source, of, energy, a, reservoir, generating, hydroelectricity, includes, turbines, connected, to, the, retained, water, body, by, large, diameter, pipes, these, generating, sets, may, be, at, the, base, of, the, dam, or, some, distance, away, in, a, flat, river, valley, a, reservoir, needs, to, be, deep, enough, to, create, a, head, of, water, at, the, turbines, and, if, there, are, periods, of, drought, the, reservoir, needs, to, hold, enough, water, to, average, out, the, river, s, flow, throughout, the, year, s, run, of, the, river, hydro, in, a, steep, valley, with, constant, flow, needs, no, reservoir, some, reservoirs, generating, hydroelectricity, use, pumped, recharge, a, high, level, reservoir, is, filled, with, water, using, high, performance, electric, pumps, at, times, when, electricity, demand, is, low, and, then, uses, this, stored, water, to, generate, electricity, by, releasing, the, stored, water, into, a, low, level, reservoir, when, electricity, demand, is, high, such, systems, are, called, pump, storage, schemes, reservoirs, can, be, used, in, a, number, of, ways, to, control, how, water, flows, through, downstream, waterways, reservoirs, can, be, used, to, balance, the, flow, in, highly, managed, systems, taking, in, water, during, high, flows, and, releasing, it, again, during, low, flows, in, order, for, this, to, work, without, pumping, requires, careful, control, of, water, levels, using, spillways, when, a, major, storm, approaches, the, dam, operators, calculate, the, volume, of, water, that, the, storm, will, add, to, the, reservoir, if, forecast, storm, water, will, overfill, the, reservoir, water, is, slowly, let, out, of, the, reservoir, prior, to, and, during, the, storm, if, done, with, sufficient, lead, time, the, major, storm, will, not, fill, the, reservoir, and, areas, downstream, will, not, experience, damaging, flows, accurate, weather, forecasts, are, essential, so, that, dam, operators, can, correctly, plan, drawdowns, prior, to, a, high, rainfall, event, dam, operators, blamed, a, faulty, weather, forecast, on, the, 2010, 2011, queensland, floods, examples, of, highly, managed, reservoirs, are, burrendong, dam, in, australia, and, bala, lake, llyn, tegid, in, north, wales, bala, lake, is, a, natural, lake, whose, level, was, raised, by, a, low, dam, and, into, which, the, river, dee, flows, or, discharges, depending, upon, flow, conditions, as, part, of, the, river, dee, regulation, system, this, mode, of, operation, is, a, form, of, hydraulic, capacitance, in, the, river, system, many, reservoirs, often, allow, some, recreational, uses, such, as, fishing, and, boating, special, rules, may, apply, for, the, safety, of, the, public, and, to, protect, the, quality, of, the, water, and, the, ecology, of, the, surrounding, area, many, reservoirs, now, support, and, encourage, less, formal, and, less, structured, recreation, such, as, natural, history, bird, watching, landscape, painting, walking, and, hiking, and, often, provide, information, boards, and, interpretation, material, to, encourage, responsible, use, water, falling, as, rain, upstream, of, the, reservoir, together, with, any, groundwater, emerging, as, springs, is, stored, in, the, reservoir, any, excess, water, can, be, spilled, via, a, specifically, designed, spillway, stored, water, may, be, piped, by, gravity, for, use, as, drinking, water, to, generate, hydro, electricity, or, to, maintain, river, flows, to, support, downstream, uses, occasionally, reservoirs, can, be, managed, to, retain, water, during, high, rainfall, events, to, prevent, or, reduce, downstream, flooding, some, reservoirs, support, several, uses, and, the, operating, rules, may, be, complex, most, modern, reservoirs, have, a, specially, designed, draw, off, tower, that, can, discharge, water, from, the, reservoir, at, different, levels, both, to, access, water, as, the, water, level, falls, and, to, allow, water, of, a, specific, quality, to, be, discharged, into, the, downstream, river, as, compensation, water, the, operators, of, many, upland, or, in, river, reservoirs, have, obligations, to, release, water, into, the, downstream, river, to, maintain, river, quality, support, fisheries, to, maintain, downstream, industrial, and, recreational, uses, or, for, a, range, of, other, purposes, such, releases, are, known, as, compensation, water, the, units, used, for, measuring, reservoir, areas, and, volumes, vary, from, country, to, country, in, most, of, the, world, reservoir, areas, are, expressed, in, square, kilometers, in, the, united, states, acres, are, commonly, used, for, volume, either, cubic, meters, or, cubic, kilometers, are, widely, used, with, acre, feet, used, in, the, us, the, capacity, volume, or, storage, of, a, reservoir, is, usually, divided, into, distinguishable, areas, dead, or, inactive, storage, refers, to, water, in, a, reservoir, that, cannot, be, drained, by, gravity, through, a, dam, s, outlet, works, spillway, or, power, plant, intake, and, can, only, be, pumped, out, dead, storage, allows, sediments, to, settle, which, improves, water, quality, and, also, creates, an, area, for, fish, during, low, levels, active, or, live, storage, is, the, portion, of, the, reservoir, that, can, be, used, for, flood, control, power, production, navigation, and, downstream, releases, in, addition, a, reservoir, s, flood, control, capacity, is, the, amount, of, water, it, can, regulate, during, flooding, the, surcharge, capacity, is, the, capacity, of, the, reservoir, above, the, spillway, crest, that, cannot, be, regulated, in, the, united, states, the, water, below, the, normal, maximum, level, of, a, reservoir, is, called, the, conservation, pool, in, the, united, kingdom, top, water, level, describes, the, reservoir, full, state, while, fully, drawn, down, describes, the, minimum, retained, volume, there, is, a, wide, variety, of, software, for, modelling, reservoirs, from, the, specialist, dam, safety, program, management, tools, dspmt, to, the, relatively, simple, waflex, to, integrated, models, like, the, water, evaluation, and, planning, system, weap, that, place, reservoir, operations, in, the, context, of, system, wide, demands, and, supplies, in, many, countries, large, reservoirs, are, closely, regulated, to, try, to, prevent, or, minimize, failures, of, containment, while, much, of, the, effort, is, directed, at, the, dam, and, its, associated, structures, as, the, weakest, part, of, the, overall, structure, the, aim, of, such, controls, is, to, prevent, an, uncontrolled, release, of, water, from, the, reservoir, reservoir, failures, can, generate, huge, increases, in, flow, down, a, river, valley, with, the, potential, to, wash, away, towns, and, villages, and, cause, considerable, loss, of, life, such, as, the, devastation, following, the, failure, of, containment, at, llyn, eigiau, which, killed, 17, people, see, also, list, of, dam, failures, a, notable, case, of, reservoirs, being, used, as, an, instrument, of, war, involved, the, british, royal, air, force, dambusters, raid, on, germany, in, world, war, ii, codenamed, operation, chastise, in, which, three, german, reservoir, dams, were, selected, to, be, breached, in, order, to, damage, german, infrastructure, and, manufacturing, and, power, capabilities, deriving, from, the, ruhr, and, eder, rivers, the, economic, and, social, impact, was, derived, from, the, enormous, volumes, of, previously, stored, water, that, swept, down, the, valleys, wreaking, destruction, this, raid, later, became, the, basis, for, several, films, all, reservoirs, will, have, a, monetary, cost, benefit, assessment, made, before, construction, to, see, if, the, project, is, worth, proceeding, with, however, such, analysis, can, often, omit, the, environmental, impacts, of, dams, and, the, reservoirs, that, they, contain, some, impacts, such, as, the, greenhouse, gas, production, associated, with, concrete, manufacture, are, relatively, easy, to, estimate, other, impacts, on, the, natural, environment, and, social, and, cultural, effects, can, be, more, difficult, to, assess, and, to, weigh, in, the, balance, but, identification, and, quantification, of, these, issues, is, now, commonly, required, in, major, construction, projects, in, the, developed, world, naturally, occurring, lakes, receive, organic, sediments, which, decay, in, an, anaerobic, environment, releasing, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, the, methane, released, is, approximately, 8, times, more, potent, as, a, greenhouse, gas, than, carbon, dioxide, as, a, human, made, reservoir, fills, existing, plants, are, submerged, and, during, the, years, it, takes, for, this, matter, to, decay, will, give, off, considerably, more, greenhouse, gases, than, lakes, do, a, reservoir, in, a, narrow, valley, or, canyon, may, cover, relatively, little, vegetation, while, one, situated, on, a, plain, may, flood, a, great, deal, of, vegetation, the, site, may, be, cleared, of, vegetation, first, or, simply, flooded, tropical, flooding, can, produce, far, more, greenhouse, gases, than, in, temperate, regions, the, following, table, indicates, reservoir, emissions, in, milligrams, per, square, meter, per, day, for, different, bodies, of, water, depending, upon, the, area, flooded, versus, power, produced, a, reservoir, built, for, hydro, electricity, generation, can, either, reduce, or, increase, the, net, production, of, greenhouse, gases, when, compared, to, other, sources, of, power, a, study, for, the, national, institute, for, research, in, the, amazon, found, that, hydroelectric, reservoirs, release, a, large, pulse, of, carbon, dioxide, from, decay, of, trees, left, standing, in, the, reservoirs, especially, during, the, first, decade, after, flooding, this, elevates, the, global, warming, impact, of, the, dams, to, levels, much, higher, than, would, occur, by, generating, the, same, power, from, fossil, fuels, according, to, the, world, commission, on, dams, report, dams, and, development, when, the, reservoir, is, relatively, large, and, no, prior, clearing, of, forest, in, the, flooded, area, was, undertaken, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, the, reservoir, could, be, higher, than, those, of, a, conventional, oil, fired, thermal, generation, plant, for, instance, in, 1990, the, impoundment, behind, the, balbina, dam, in, brazil, inaugurated, in, 1987, had, over, 20, times, the, impact, on, global, warming, than, would, generating, the, same, power, from, fossil, fuels, due, to, the, large, area, flooded, per, unit, of, electricity, generated, another, study, published, in, the, global, biogeochemical, cycles, also, found, that, newly, flooded, reservoirs, released, more, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, than, the, pre, flooded, landscape, noting, that, forest, lands, wetlands, and, preexisting, water, features, all, released, differing, amounts, of, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, both, pre, and, post, flooding, the, tucuru, dam, in, brazil, completed, in, 1984, had, only, 0, 4, times, the, impact, on, global, warming, than, would, generating, the, same, power, from, fossil, fuels, a, two, year, study, of, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, releases, in, canada, concluded, that, while, the, hydroelectric, reservoirs, there, do, emit, greenhouse, gases, it, is, on, a, much, smaller, scale, than, thermal, power, plants, of, similar, capacity, hydropower, typically, emits, 35, to, 70, times, less, greenhouse, gases, per, twh, of, electricity, than, thermal, power, plants, a, decrease, in, air, pollution, occurs, when, a, dam, is, used, in, place, of, thermal, power, generation, since, electricity, produced, from, hydroelectric, generation, does, not, give, rise, to, any, flue, gas, emissions, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, including, sulfur, dioxide, nitric, oxide, and, carbon, monoxide, from, coal, dams, can, produce, a, block, for, migrating, fish, trapping, them, in, one, area, producing, food, and, a, habitat, for, various, water, birds, they, can, also, flood, various, ecosystems, on, land, and, may, cause, extinctions, creating, reservoirs, can, alter, the, natural, biogeochemical, cycle, of, mercury, after, a, reservoir, s, initial, formation, there, is, a, large, increase, in, the, production, of, toxic, methylmercury, mehg, via, microbial, methylation, in, flooded, soils, and, peat, mehg, levels, have, also, been, found, to, increase, in, zooplankton, and, in, fish, dams, can, severely, reduce, the, amount, of, water, reaching, countries, downstream, of, them, causing, water, stress, between, the, countries, e, g, the, sudan, and, egypt, which, damages, farming, businesses, in, the, downstream, countries, and, reduces, drinking, water, farms, and, villages, e, g, ashopton, can, be, flooded, by, the, creation, of, reservoirs, ruining, many, livelihoods, for, this, very, reason, worldwide, 80, million, people, figure, is, as, of, 2009, from, the, edexcel, gcse, geography, textbook, have, had, to, be, forcibly, relocated, due, to, dam, construction, the, limnology, of, reservoirs, has, many, similarities, to, that, of, lakes, of, equivalent, size, there, are, however, significant, differences, many, reservoirs, experience, considerable, variations, in, level, producing, significant, areas, that, are, intermittently, underwater, or, dried, out, this, greatly, limits, the, productivity, or, the, water, margins, and, also, limits, the, number, of, species, able, to, survive, in, these, conditions, upland, reservoirs, tend, to, have, a, much, shorter, residence, time, than, natural, lakes, and, this, can, lead, to, more, rapid, cycling, of, nutrients, through, the, water, body, so, that, they, are, more, quickly, lost, to, the, system, this, may, be, seen, as, a, mismatch, between, water, chemistry, and, water, biology, with, a, tendency, for, the, biological, component, to, be, more, oligotrophic, than, the, chemistry, would, suggest, conversely, lowland, reservoirs, drawing, water, from, nutrient, rich, rivers, may, show, exaggerated, eutrophic, characteristics, because, the, residence, time, in, the, reservoir, is, much, greater, than, in, the, river, and, the, biological, systems, have, a, much, greater, opportunity, to, utilise, the, available, nutrients, deep, reservoirs, with, multiple, level, draw, off, towers, can, discharge, deep, cold, water, into, the, downstream, river, greatly, reducing, the, size, of, any, hypolimnion, this, in, turn, can, reduce, the, concentrations, of, phosphorus, released, during, any, annual, mixing, event, and, may, therefore, reduce, productivity, the, dams, in, front, of, reservoirs, act, as, knickpoints, the, energy, of, the, water, falling, from, them, reduces, and, deposition, is, a, result, below, the, dams, the, filling, impounding, of, reservoirs, has, often, been, attributed, to, reservoir, triggered, seismicity, rts, as, seismic, events, have, occurred, near, large, dams, or, within, their, reservoirs, in, the, past, these, events, may, have, been, triggered, by, the, filling, or, operation, of, the, reservoir, and, are, on, a, small, scale, when, compared, to, the, amount, of, reservoirs, worldwide, of, over, 100, recorded, events, some, early, examples, include, the, 60, m, 197, ft, tall, marathon, dam, in, greece, 1929, the, 221, m, 725, ft, tall, hoover, dam, in, the, u, s, 1935, most, events, involve, large, dams, and, small, amounts, of, seismicity, the, only, four, recorded, events, above, a, 6, 0, magnitude, m, w, are, the, 103, m, 338, ft, tall, koyna, dam, in, india, and, the, 120, m, 394, ft, kremasta, dam, in, greece, which, both, registered, 6, 3, m, w, the, 122, m, 400, ft, high, kariba, dam, in, zambia, at, 6, 25, m, w, and, the, 105, m, 344, ft, xinfengjiang, dam, in, china, at, 6, 1, m, w, disputes, have, occurred, regarding, when, rts, has, occurred, due, to, a, lack, of, hydrogeological, knowledge, at, the, time, of, the, event, it, is, accepted, though, that, the, infiltration, of, water, into, pores, and, the, weight, of, the, reservoir, do, contribute, to, rts, patterns, for, rts, to, occur, there, must, be, a, seismic, structure, near, the, dam, or, its, reservoir, and, the, seismic, structure, must, be, close, to, failure, additionally, water, must, be, able, to, infiltrate, the, deep, rock, stratum, as, the, weight, of, a, 100, m, 328, ft, deep, reservoir, will, have, little, impact, when, compared, the, deadweight, of, rock, on, a, crustal, stress, field, which, may, be, located, at, a, depth, of, 10, km, 6, mi, or, more, reservoirs, may, change, the, local, climate, increasing, humidity, and, reducing, extremes, of, temperature, especially, in, dry, areas, such, effects, are, claimed, also, by, some, south, australian, wineries, as, increasing, the, quality, of, the, wine, production, in, 2005, there, were, 33, 105, large, dams, 15, m, height, listed, by, the, international, commission, on, large, dams, icold
