concrete, is, a, composite, material, composed, of, aggregate, bonded, together, with, a, fluid, cement, that, cures, to, a, solid, over, time, concrete, is, the, second, most, used, substance, in, the, world, after, water, and, is, the, most, widely, used, building, material, its, usage, worldwide, ton, for, ton, is, twice, that, of, steel, wood, plastics, and, aluminium, combined, when, aggregate, is, mixed, with, dry, portland, cement, and, water, the, mixture, forms, a, fluid, slurry, that, is, easily, poured, and, molded, into, shape, the, cement, reacts, with, the, water, through, a, process, called, concrete, hydration, that, hardens, it, over, several, hours, to, form, a, hard, matrix, that, binds, the, materials, together, into, a, durable, stone, like, material, that, has, many, uses, this, time, allows, concrete, to, not, only, be, cast, in, forms, but, also, to, have, a, variety, of, tooled, processes, performed, the, hydration, process, is, exothermic, which, means, ambient, temperature, plays, a, significant, role, in, how, long, it, takes, concrete, to, set, often, additives, such, as, pozzolans, or, superplasticizers, are, included, in, the, mixture, to, improve, the, physical, properties, of, the, wet, mix, delay, or, accelerate, the, curing, time, or, otherwise, change, the, finished, material, most, concrete, is, poured, with, reinforcing, materials, such, as, steel, rebar, embedded, to, provide, tensile, strength, yielding, reinforced, concrete, in, the, past, lime, based, cement, binders, such, as, lime, putty, were, often, used, but, sometimes, with, other, hydraulic, cements, water, resistant, such, as, a, calcium, aluminate, cement, or, with, portland, cement, to, form, portland, cement, concrete, named, for, its, visual, resemblance, to, portland, stone, many, other, non, cementitious, types, of, concrete, exist, with, other, methods, of, binding, aggregate, together, including, asphalt, concrete, with, a, bitumen, binder, which, is, frequently, used, for, road, surfaces, and, polymer, concretes, that, use, polymers, as, a, binder, concrete, is, distinct, from, mortar, whereas, concrete, is, itself, a, building, material, mortar, is, a, bonding, agent, that, typically, holds, bricks, tiles, and, other, masonry, units, together, grout, is, another, material, associated, with, concrete, and, cement, it, does, not, contain, coarse, aggregates, and, is, usually, either, pourable, or, thixotropic, and, is, used, to, fill, gaps, between, masonry, components, or, coarse, aggregate, which, has, already, been, put, in, place, some, methods, of, concrete, manufacture, and, repair, involve, pumping, grout, into, the, gaps, to, make, up, a, solid, mass, in, situ, the, word, concrete, comes, from, the, latin, word, concretus, meaning, compact, or, condensed, the, perfect, passive, participle, of, concrescere, from, con, together, and, crescere, to, grow, concrete, floors, were, found, in, the, royal, palace, of, tiryns, greece, which, dates, roughly, to, 1400, to, 1200, bc, lime, mortars, were, used, in, greece, such, as, in, crete, and, cyprus, in, 800, bc, the, assyrian, jerwan, aqueduct, 688, bc, made, use, of, waterproof, concrete, concrete, was, used, for, construction, in, many, ancient, structures, mayan, concrete, at, the, ruins, of, uxmal, ad, 850, 925, is, referenced, in, incidents, of, travel, in, the, yucat, n, by, john, l, stephens, the, roof, is, flat, and, had, been, covered, with, cement, the, floors, were, cement, in, some, places, hard, but, by, long, exposure, broken, and, now, crumbling, under, the, feet, but, throughout, the, wall, was, solid, and, consisting, of, large, stones, imbedded, in, mortar, almost, as, hard, as, rock, small, scale, production, of, concrete, like, materials, was, pioneered, by, the, nabatean, traders, who, occupied, and, controlled, a, series, of, oases, and, developed, a, small, empire, in, the, regions, of, southern, syria, and, northern, jordan, from, the, 4th, century, bc, they, discovered, the, advantages, of, hydraulic, lime, with, some, self, cementing, properties, by, 700, bc, they, built, kilns, to, supply, mortar, for, the, construction, of, rubble, masonry, houses, concrete, floors, and, underground, waterproof, cisterns, they, kept, the, cisterns, secret, as, these, enabled, the, nabataeans, to, thrive, in, the, desert, some, of, these, structures, survive, to, this, day, in, the, ancient, egyptian, and, later, roman, eras, builders, discovered, that, adding, volcanic, ash, to, lime, allowed, the, mix, to, set, underwater, they, discovered, the, pozzolanic, reaction, the, romans, used, concrete, extensively, from, 300, bc, to, ad, 476, during, the, roman, empire, roman, concrete, or, opus, caementicium, was, made, from, quicklime, pozzolana, and, an, aggregate, of, pumice, its, widespread, use, in, many, roman, structures, a, key, event, in, the, history, of, architecture, termed, the, roman, architectural, revolution, freed, roman, construction, from, the, restrictions, of, stone, and, brick, materials, it, enabled, revolutionary, new, designs, in, terms, of, both, structural, complexity, and, dimension, the, colosseum, in, rome, was, built, largely, of, concrete, and, the, pantheon, has, the, world, s, largest, unreinforced, concrete, dome, concrete, as, the, romans, knew, it, was, a, new, and, revolutionary, material, laid, in, the, shape, of, arches, vaults, and, domes, it, quickly, hardened, into, a, rigid, mass, free, from, many, of, the, internal, thrusts, and, strains, that, troubled, the, builders, of, similar, structures, in, stone, or, brick, modern, tests, show, that, opus, caementicium, had, as, much, compressive, strength, as, modern, portland, cement, concrete, c, 200, kg, cm, 2, however, due, to, the, absence, of, reinforcement, its, tensile, strength, was, far, lower, than, modern, reinforced, concrete, and, its, mode, of, application, also, differed, modern, structural, concrete, differs, from, roman, concrete, in, two, important, details, first, its, mix, consistency, is, fluid, and, homogeneous, allowing, it, to, be, poured, into, forms, rather, than, requiring, hand, layering, together, with, the, placement, of, aggregate, which, in, roman, practice, often, consisted, of, rubble, second, integral, reinforcing, steel, gives, modern, concrete, assemblies, great, strength, in, tension, whereas, roman, concrete, could, depend, only, upon, the, strength, of, the, concrete, bonding, to, resist, tension, the, long, term, durability, of, roman, concrete, structures, has, been, found, to, be, due, to, its, use, of, pyroclastic, volcanic, rock, and, ash, whereby, the, crystallization, of, str, tlingite, a, specific, and, complex, calcium, aluminosilicate, hydrate, and, the, coalescence, of, this, and, similar, calcium, aluminium, silicate, hydrate, cementing, binders, helped, give, the, concrete, a, greater, degree, of, fracture, resistance, even, in, seismically, active, environments, roman, concrete, is, significantly, more, resistant, to, erosion, by, seawater, than, modern, concrete, it, used, pyroclastic, materials, which, react, with, seawater, to, form, al, tobermorite, crystals, over, time, the, use, of, hot, mixing, and, the, presence, of, lime, clasts, are, thought, to, give, the, concrete, a, self, healing, ability, where, cracks, that, form, become, filled, with, calcite, that, prevents, the, crack, from, spreading, the, widespread, use, of, concrete, in, many, roman, structures, ensured, that, many, survive, to, the, present, day, the, baths, of, caracalla, in, rome, are, just, one, example, many, roman, aqueducts, and, bridges, such, as, the, magnificent, pont, du, gard, in, southern, france, have, masonry, cladding, on, a, concrete, core, as, does, the, dome, of, the, pantheon, after, the, roman, empire, the, use, of, burned, lime, and, pozzolana, was, greatly, reduced, low, kiln, temperatures, in, the, burning, of, lime, lack, of, pozzolana, and, poor, mixing, all, contributed, to, a, decline, in, the, quality, of, concrete, and, mortar, from, the, 11th, century, the, increased, use, of, stone, in, church, and, castle, construction, led, to, an, increased, demand, for, mortar, quality, began, to, improve, in, the, 12th, century, through, better, grinding, and, sieving, medieval, lime, mortars, and, concretes, were, non, hydraulic, and, were, used, for, binding, masonry, hearting, binding, rubble, masonry, cores, and, foundations, bartholomaeus, anglicus, in, his, de, proprietatibus, rerum, 1240, describes, the, making, of, mortar, in, an, english, translation, from, 1397, it, reads, lyme, is, a, stone, brent, by, medlynge, thereof, with, sonde, and, water, sement, is, made, from, the, 14th, century, the, quality, of, mortar, was, again, excellent, but, only, from, the, 17th, century, was, pozzolana, commonly, added, the, canal, du, midi, was, built, using, concrete, in, 1670, perhaps, the, greatest, step, forward, in, the, modern, use, of, concrete, was, smeaton, s, tower, built, by, british, engineer, john, smeaton, in, devon, england, between, 1756, and, 1759, this, third, eddystone, lighthouse, pioneered, the, use, of, hydraulic, lime, in, concrete, using, pebbles, and, powdered, brick, as, aggregate, a, method, for, producing, portland, cement, was, developed, in, england, and, patented, by, joseph, aspdin, in, 1824, aspdin, chose, the, name, for, its, similarity, to, portland, stone, which, was, quarried, on, the, isle, of, portland, in, dorset, england, his, son, william, continued, developments, into, the, 1840s, earning, him, recognition, for, the, development, of, modern, portland, cement, reinforced, concrete, was, invented, in, 1849, by, joseph, monier, and, the, first, reinforced, concrete, house, was, built, by, fran, ois, coignet, in, 1853, the, first, concrete, reinforced, bridge, was, designed, and, built, by, joseph, monier, in, 1875, prestressed, concrete, and, post, tensioned, concrete, were, pioneered, by, eug, ne, freyssinet, a, french, structural, and, civil, engineer, concrete, components, or, structures, are, compressed, by, tendon, cables, during, or, after, their, fabrication, in, order, to, strengthen, them, against, tensile, forces, developing, when, put, in, service, freyssinet, patented, the, technique, on, 2, october, 1928, concrete, is, an, artificial, composite, material, comprising, a, matrix, of, cementitious, binder, typically, portland, cement, paste, or, asphalt, and, a, dispersed, phase, or, filler, of, aggregate, typically, a, rocky, material, loose, stones, and, sand, the, binder, glues, the, filler, together, to, form, a, synthetic, conglomerate, many, types, of, concrete, are, available, determined, by, the, formulations, of, binders, and, the, types, of, aggregate, used, to, suit, the, application, of, the, engineered, material, these, variables, determine, strength, and, density, as, well, as, chemical, and, thermal, resistance, of, the, finished, product, construction, aggregates, consist, of, large, chunks, of, material, in, a, concrete, mix, generally, a, coarse, gravel, or, crushed, rocks, such, as, limestone, or, granite, along, with, finer, materials, such, as, sand, cement, paste, most, commonly, made, of, portland, cement, is, the, most, prevalent, kind, of, concrete, binder, for, cementitious, binders, water, is, mixed, with, the, dry, cement, powder, and, aggregate, which, produces, a, semi, liquid, slurry, paste, that, can, be, shaped, typically, by, pouring, it, into, a, form, the, concrete, solidifies, and, hardens, through, a, chemical, process, called, hydration, the, water, reacts, with, the, cement, which, bonds, the, other, components, together, creating, a, robust, stone, like, material, other, cementitious, materials, such, as, fly, ash, and, slag, cement, are, sometimes, added, either, pre, blended, with, the, cement, or, directly, as, a, concrete, component, and, become, a, part, of, the, binder, for, the, aggregate, fly, ash, and, slag, can, enhance, some, properties, of, concrete, such, as, fresh, properties, and, durability, alternatively, other, materials, can, also, be, used, as, a, concrete, binder, the, most, prevalent, substitute, is, asphalt, which, is, used, as, the, binder, in, asphalt, concrete, admixtures, are, added, to, modify, the, cure, rate, or, properties, of, the, material, mineral, admixtures, use, recycled, materials, as, concrete, ingredients, conspicuous, materials, include, fly, ash, a, by, product, of, coal, fired, power, plants, ground, granulated, blast, furnace, slag, a, by, product, of, steelmaking, and, silica, fume, a, by, product, of, industrial, electric, arc, furnaces, structures, employing, portland, cement, concrete, usually, include, steel, reinforcement, because, this, type, of, concrete, can, be, formulated, with, high, compressive, strength, but, always, has, lower, tensile, strength, therefore, it, is, usually, reinforced, with, materials, that, are, strong, in, tension, typically, steel, rebar, the, mix, design, depends, on, the, type, of, structure, being, built, how, the, concrete, is, mixed, and, delivered, and, how, it, is, placed, to, form, the, structure, portland, cement, is, the, most, common, type, of, cement, in, general, usage, it, is, a, basic, ingredient, of, concrete, mortar, and, many, plasters, it, consists, of, a, mixture, of, calcium, silicates, alite, belite, aluminates, and, ferrites, compounds, which, will, react, with, water, portland, cement, and, similar, materials, are, made, by, heating, limestone, a, source, of, calcium, with, clay, or, shale, a, source, of, silicon, aluminium, and, iron, and, grinding, this, product, called, clinker, with, a, source, of, sulfate, most, commonly, gypsum, cement, kilns, are, extremely, large, complex, and, inherently, dusty, industrial, installations, of, the, various, ingredients, used, to, produce, a, given, quantity, of, concrete, the, cement, is, the, most, energetically, expensive, even, complex, and, efficient, kilns, require, 3, 3, to, 3, 6, gigajoules, of, energy, to, produce, a, ton, of, clinker, and, then, grind, it, into, cement, many, kilns, can, be, fueled, with, difficult, to, dispose, of, wastes, the, most, common, being, used, tires, the, extremely, high, temperatures, and, long, periods, of, time, at, those, temperatures, allows, cement, kilns, to, efficiently, and, completely, burn, even, difficult, to, use, fuels, the, five, major, compounds, of, calcium, silicates, and, aluminates, comprising, portland, cement, range, from, 5, to, 50, in, weight, combining, water, with, a, cementitious, material, forms, a, cement, paste, by, the, process, of, hydration, the, cement, paste, glues, the, aggregate, together, fills, voids, within, it, and, makes, it, flow, more, freely, as, stated, by, abrams, law, a, lower, water, to, cement, ratio, yields, a, stronger, more, durable, concrete, whereas, more, water, gives, a, freer, flowing, concrete, with, a, higher, slump, the, hydration, of, cement, involves, many, concurrent, reactions, the, process, involves, polymerization, the, interlinking, of, the, silicates, and, aluminate, components, as, well, as, their, bonding, to, sand, and, gravel, particles, to, form, a, solid, mass, one, illustrative, conversion, is, the, hydration, of, tricalcium, silicate, the, hydration, curing, of, cement, is, irreversible, fine, and, coarse, aggregates, make, up, the, bulk, of, a, concrete, mixture, sand, natural, gravel, and, crushed, stone, are, used, mainly, for, this, purpose, recycled, aggregates, from, construction, demolition, and, excavation, waste, are, increasingly, used, as, partial, replacements, for, natural, aggregates, while, a, number, of, manufactured, aggregates, including, air, cooled, blast, furnace, slag, and, bottom, ash, are, also, permitted, the, size, distribution, of, the, aggregate, determines, how, much, binder, is, required, aggregate, with, a, very, even, size, distribution, has, the, biggest, gaps, whereas, adding, aggregate, with, smaller, particles, tends, to, fill, these, gaps, the, binder, must, fill, the, gaps, between, the, aggregate, as, well, as, paste, the, surfaces, of, the, aggregate, together, and, is, typically, the, most, expensive, component, thus, variation, in, sizes, of, the, aggregate, reduces, the, cost, of, concrete, the, aggregate, is, nearly, always, stronger, than, the, binder, so, its, use, does, not, negatively, affect, the, strength, of, the, concrete, redistribution, of, aggregates, after, compaction, often, creates, non, homogeneity, due, to, the, influence, of, vibration, this, can, lead, to, strength, gradients, decorative, stones, such, as, quartzite, small, river, stones, or, crushed, glass, are, sometimes, added, to, the, surface, of, concrete, for, a, decorative, exposed, aggregate, finish, popular, among, landscape, designers, admixtures, are, materials, in, the, form, of, powder, or, fluids, that, are, added, to, the, concrete, to, give, it, certain, characteristics, not, obtainable, with, plain, concrete, mixes, admixtures, are, defined, as, additions, made, as, the, concrete, mix, is, being, prepared, the, most, common, admixtures, are, retarders, and, accelerators, in, normal, use, admixture, dosages, are, less, than, 5, by, mass, of, cement, and, are, added, to, the, concrete, at, the, time, of, batching, mixing, see, production, below, the, common, types, of, admixtures, are, as, follows, inorganic, materials, that, have, pozzolanic, or, latent, hydraulic, properties, these, very, fine, grained, materials, are, added, to, the, concrete, mix, to, improve, the, properties, of, concrete, mineral, admixtures, or, as, a, replacement, for, portland, cement, blended, cements, products, which, incorporate, limestone, fly, ash, blast, furnace, slag, and, other, useful, materials, with, pozzolanic, properties, into, the, mix, are, being, tested, and, used, these, developments, are, ever, growing, in, relevance, to, minimize, the, impacts, caused, by, cement, use, notorious, for, being, one, of, the, largest, producers, at, about, 5, to, 10, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, the, use, of, alternative, materials, also, is, capable, of, lowering, costs, improving, concrete, properties, and, recycling, wastes, the, latest, being, relevant, for, circular, economy, aspects, of, the, construction, industry, whose, demand, is, ever, growing, with, greater, impacts, on, raw, material, extraction, waste, generation, and, landfill, practices, concrete, production, is, the, process, of, mixing, together, the, various, ingredients, water, aggregate, cement, and, any, additives, to, produce, concrete, concrete, production, is, time, sensitive, once, the, ingredients, are, mixed, workers, must, put, the, concrete, in, place, before, it, hardens, in, modern, usage, most, concrete, production, takes, place, in, a, large, type, of, industrial, facility, called, a, concrete, plant, or, often, a, batch, plant, the, usual, method, of, placement, is, casting, in, formwork, which, holds, the, mix, in, shape, until, it, has, set, enough, to, hold, its, shape, unaided, concrete, plants, come, in, two, main, types, ready, mix, plants, and, central, mix, plants, a, ready, mix, plant, blends, all, of, the, solid, ingredients, while, a, central, mix, does, the, same, but, adds, water, a, central, mix, plant, offers, more, precise, control, of, the, concrete, quality, central, mix, plants, must, be, close, to, the, work, site, where, the, concrete, will, be, used, since, hydration, begins, at, the, plant, a, concrete, plant, consists, of, large, hoppers, for, storage, of, various, ingredients, like, cement, storage, for, bulk, ingredients, like, aggregate, and, water, mechanisms, for, the, addition, of, various, additives, and, amendments, machinery, to, accurately, weigh, move, and, mix, some, or, all, of, those, ingredients, and, facilities, to, dispense, the, mixed, concrete, often, to, a, concrete, mixer, truck, modern, concrete, is, usually, prepared, as, a, viscous, fluid, so, that, it, may, be, poured, into, forms, the, forms, are, containers, that, define, the, desired, shape, concrete, formwork, can, be, prepared, in, several, ways, such, as, slip, forming, and, steel, plate, construction, alternatively, concrete, can, be, mixed, into, dryer, non, fluid, forms, and, used, in, factory, settings, to, manufacture, precast, concrete, products, interruption, in, pouring, the, concrete, can, cause, the, initially, placed, material, to, begin, to, set, before, the, next, batch, is, added, on, top, this, creates, a, horizontal, plane, of, weakness, called, a, cold, joint, between, the, two, batches, once, the, mix, is, where, it, should, be, the, curing, process, must, be, controlled, to, ensure, that, the, concrete, attains, the, desired, attributes, during, concrete, preparation, various, technical, details, may, affect, the, quality, and, nature, of, the, product, design, mix, ratios, are, decided, by, an, engineer, after, analyzing, the, properties, of, the, specific, ingredients, being, used, instead, of, using, a, nominal, mix, of, 1, part, cement, 2, parts, sand, and, 4, parts, aggregate, the, second, example, from, above, a, civil, engineer, will, custom, design, a, concrete, mix, to, exactly, meet, the, requirements, of, the, site, and, conditions, setting, material, ratios, and, often, designing, an, admixture, package, to, fine, tune, the, properties, or, increase, the, performance, envelope, of, the, mix, design, mix, concrete, can, have, very, broad, specifications, that, cannot, be, met, with, more, basic, nominal, mixes, but, the, involvement, of, the, engineer, often, increases, the, cost, of, the, concrete, mix, concrete, mixes, are, primarily, divided, into, nominal, mix, standard, mix, and, design, mix, nominal, mix, ratios, are, given, in, volume, of, cement, sand, aggregate, displaystyle, text, cement, sand, aggregate, nominal, mixes, are, a, simple, fast, way, of, getting, a, basic, idea, of, the, properties, of, the, finished, concrete, without, having, to, perform, testing, in, advance, various, governing, bodies, such, as, british, standards, define, nominal, mix, ratios, into, a, number, of, grades, usually, ranging, from, lower, compressive, strength, to, higher, compressive, strength, the, grades, usually, indicate, the, 28, day, cube, strength, thorough, mixing, is, essential, to, produce, uniform, high, quality, concrete, separate, paste, mixing, has, shown, that, the, mixing, of, cement, and, water, into, a, paste, before, combining, these, materials, with, aggregates, can, increase, the, compressive, strength, of, the, resulting, concrete, the, paste, is, generally, mixed, in, a, high, speed, shear, type, mixer, at, a, w, c, water, to, cement, ratio, of, 0, 30, to, 0, 45, by, mass, the, cement, paste, premix, may, include, admixtures, such, as, accelerators, or, retarders, superplasticizers, pigments, or, silica, fume, the, premixed, paste, is, then, blended, with, aggregates, and, any, remaining, batch, water, and, final, mixing, is, completed, in, conventional, concrete, mixing, equipment, workability, is, the, ability, of, a, fresh, plastic, concrete, mix, to, fill, the, form, mold, properly, with, the, desired, work, pouring, pumping, spreading, tamping, vibration, and, without, reducing, the, concrete, s, quality, workability, depends, on, water, content, aggregate, shape, and, size, distribution, cementitious, content, and, age, level, of, hydration, and, can, be, modified, by, adding, chemical, admixtures, like, superplasticizer, raising, the, water, content, or, adding, chemical, admixtures, increases, concrete, workability, excessive, water, leads, to, increased, bleeding, or, segregation, of, aggregates, when, the, cement, and, aggregates, start, to, separate, with, the, resulting, concrete, having, reduced, quality, changes, in, gradation, can, also, affect, workability, of, the, concrete, although, a, wide, range, of, gradation, can, be, used, for, various, applications, an, undesirable, gradation, can, mean, using, a, large, aggregate, that, is, too, large, for, the, size, of, the, formwork, or, which, has, too, few, smaller, aggregate, grades, to, serve, to, fill, the, gaps, between, the, larger, grades, or, using, too, little, or, too, much, sand, for, the, same, reason, or, using, too, little, water, or, too, much, cement, or, even, using, jagged, crushed, stone, instead, of, smoother, round, aggregate, such, as, pebbles, any, combination, of, these, factors, and, others, may, result, in, a, mix, which, is, too, harsh, i, e, which, does, not, flow, or, spread, out, smoothly, is, difficult, to, get, into, the, formwork, and, which, is, difficult, to, surface, finish, workability, can, be, measured, by, the, concrete, slump, test, a, simple, measure, of, the, plasticity, of, a, fresh, batch, of, concrete, following, the, astm, c, 143, or, en, 12350, 2, test, standards, slump, is, normally, measured, by, filling, an, abrams, cone, with, a, sample, from, a, fresh, batch, of, concrete, the, cone, is, placed, with, the, wide, end, down, onto, a, level, non, absorptive, surface, it, is, then, filled, in, three, layers, of, equal, volume, with, each, layer, being, tamped, with, a, steel, rod, to, consolidate, the, layer, when, the, cone, is, carefully, lifted, off, the, enclosed, material, slumps, a, certain, amount, owing, to, gravity, a, relatively, dry, sample, slumps, very, little, having, a, slump, value, of, one, or, two, inches, 25, or, 50, mm, out, of, one, foot, 300, mm, a, relatively, wet, concrete, sample, may, slump, as, much, as, eight, inches, workability, can, also, be, measured, by, the, flow, table, test, slump, can, be, increased, by, addition, of, chemical, admixtures, such, as, plasticizer, or, superplasticizer, without, changing, the, water, cement, ratio, some, other, admixtures, especially, air, entraining, admixture, can, increase, the, slump, of, a, mix, high, flow, concrete, like, self, consolidating, concrete, is, tested, by, other, flow, measuring, methods, one, of, these, methods,

decades, the, conversion, of, calcium, hydroxide, in, the, concrete, into, calcium, carbonate, from, absorption, of, co, 2, over, several, decades, further, strengthens, the, concrete, and, makes, it, more, resistant, to, damage, this, carbonation, reaction, however, lowers, the, ph, of, the, cement, pore, solution, and, can, corrode, the, reinforcement, bars, hydration, and, hardening, of, concrete, during, the, first, three, days, is, critical, abnormally, fast, drying, and, shrinkage, due, to, factors, such, as, evaporation, from, wind, during, placement, may, lead, to, increased, tensile, stresses, at, a, time, when, it, has, not, yet, gained, sufficient, strength, resulting, in, greater, shrinkage, cracking, the, early, strength, of, the, concrete, can, be, increased, if, it, is, kept, damp, during, the, curing, process, minimizing, stress, prior, to, curing, minimizes, cracking, high, early, strength, concrete, is, designed, to, hydrate, faster, often, by, increased, use, of, cement, that, increases, shrinkage, and, cracking, the, strength, of, concrete, changes, increases, for, up, to, three, years, it, depends, on, cross, section, dimension, of, elements, and, conditions, of, structure, exploitation, addition, of, short, cut, polymer, fibers, can, improve, reduce, shrinkage, induced, stresses, during, curing, and, increase, early, and, ultimate, compression, strength, properly, curing, concrete, leads, to, increased, strength, and, lower, permeability, and, avoids, cracking, where, the, surface, dries, out, prematurely, care, must, also, be, taken, to, avoid, freezing, or, overheating, due, to, the, exothermic, setting, of, cement, improper, curing, can, cause, spalling, reduced, strength, poor, abrasion, resistance, and, cracking, during, the, curing, period, concrete, is, ideally, maintained, at, controlled, temperature, and, humidity, to, ensure, full, hydration, during, curing, concrete, slabs, are, often, sprayed, with,

also, permits, rainwater, to, filter, through, roads, and, parking, lots, to, recharge, aquifers, instead, of, contributing, to, runoff, and, flooding, polymer, concretes, are, mixtures, of, aggregate, and, any, of, various, polymers, and, may, be, reinforced, the, cement, is, costlier, than, lime, based, cements, but, polymer, concretes, nevertheless, have, advantages, they, have, significant, tensile, strength, even, without, reinforcement, and, they, are, largely, impervious, to, water, polymer, concretes, are, frequently, used, for, the, repair, and, construction, of, other, applications, such, as, drains, sulfur, concrete, is, a, special, concrete, that, uses, sulfur, as, a, binder, and, does, not, require, cement, or, water, volcanic, concrete, substitutes, volcanic, rock, for, the, limestone, that, is, burned, to, form, clinker, it, consumes, a, similar, amount, of, energy, but, does, not, directly, emit, carbon, as, a, byproduct, volcanic, rock, ash, are, used, as, supplementary, cementitious, materials, in, concrete, to, improve, the, resistance, to, sulfate, chloride, and, alkali, silica, reaction, due, to, pore, refinement, also, they, are, generally, cost, effective, in, comparison, to, other, aggregates, good, for, semi, and, light, weight, concretes, and, good, for, thermal, and, acoustic, insulation, pyroclastic, materials, such, as, pumice, scoria, and, ashes, are, formed, from, cooling, magma, during, explosive, volcanic, eruptions, they, are, used, as, supplementary, cementitious, materials, scm, or, as, aggregates, for, cements, and, concretes, they, have, been, extensively, used, since, ancient, times, to, produce, materials, for, building, applications, for, example, pumice, and, other, volcanic, glasses, were, added, as, a, natural, pozzolanic, material, for, mortars, and, plasters, during, the, construction, of, the, villa, san, marco, in, the, roman, period, 89, bc, 79, ad, which, remain, one, of, the, best, preserved, otium, villae, of, the, bay, of, naples, in, italy, waste, light, is, a, form, of, polymer, modified, concrete, the, specific, polymer, admixture, allows, the, replacement, of, all, the, traditional, aggregates, gravel, sand, stone, by, any, mixture, of, solid, waste, materials, in, the, grain, size, of, 3, 10, mm, to, form, a, low, compressive, strength, 3, 20, n, mm, 2, product, for, road, and, building, construction, one, cubic, meter, of, waste, light, concrete, contains, 1, 1, 1, 3, m, 3, of, shredded, waste, and, no, other, aggregates, concrete, has, relatively, high, compressive, strength, but, much, lower, tensile, strength, therefore, it, is, usually, reinforced, with, materials, that, are, strong, in, tension, often, steel, the, elasticity, of, concrete, is, relatively, constant, at, low, stress, levels, but, starts, decreasing, at, higher, stress, levels, as, matrix, cracking, develops, concrete, has, a, very, low, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, and, shrinks, as, it, matures, all, concrete, structures, crack, to, some, extent, due, to, shrinkage, and, tension, concrete, that, is, subjected, to, long, duration, forces, is, prone, to, creep, tests, can, be, performed, to, ensure, that, the, properties, of, concrete, correspond, to, specifications, for, the, application, the, ingredients, affect, the, strengths, of, the, material, concrete, strength, values, are, usually, specified, as, the, lower, bound, compressive, strength, of, either, a, cylindrical, or, cubic, specimen, as, determined, by, standard, test, procedures, the, strengths, of, concrete, is, dictated, by, its, function, very, low, strength, 14, mpa, 2, 000, psi, or, less, concrete, may, be, used, when, the, concrete, must, be, lightweight, lightweight, concrete, is, often, achieved, by, adding, air, foams, or, lightweight, aggregates, with, the, side, effect, that, the, strength, is, reduced, for, most, routine, uses, 20, to, 32, mpa, 2, 900, to, 4, 600, psi, concrete, is, often, used, 40, mpa, 5, 800, psi, concrete, is, readily, commercially, available, as, a, more, durable, although, more, expensive, option, higher, strength, concrete, is, often, used, for, larger, civil, projects, strengths, above, 40, mpa, 5, 800, psi, are, often, used, for, specific, building, elements, for, example, the, lower, floor, columns, of, high, rise, concrete, buildings, may, use, concrete, of, 80, mpa, 11, 600, psi, or, more, to, keep, the, size, of, the, columns, small, bridges, may, use, long, beams, of, high, strength, concrete, to, lower, the, number, of, spans, required, occasionally, other, structural, needs, may, require, high, strength, concrete, if, a, structure, must, be, very, rigid, concrete, of, very, high, strength, may, be, specified, even, much, stronger, than, is, required, to, bear, the, service, loads, strengths, as, high, as, 130, mpa, 18, 900, psi, have, been, used, commercially, for, these, reasons, the, cement, produced, for, making, concrete, accounts, for, about, 8, of, worldwide, co, 2, emissions, per, year, compared, to, e, g, global, aviation, at, 1, 9, the, two, largest, sources, of, co, 2, are, produced, by, the, cement, manufacturing, process, arising, from, 1, the, decarbonation, reaction, of, limestone, in, the, cement, kiln, t, 950, c, and, 2, from, the, combustion, of, fossil, fuel, to, reach, the, sintering, temperature, t, 1450, c, of, cement, clinker, in, the, kiln, the, energy, required, for, extracting, crushing, and, mixing, the, raw, materials, construction, aggregates, used, in, the, concrete, production, and, also, limestone, and, clay, feeding, the, cement, kiln, is, lower, energy, requirement, for, transportation, of, ready, mix, concrete, is, also, lower, because, it, is, produced, nearby, the, construction, site, from, local, resources, typically, manufactured, within, 100, kilometers, of, the, job, site, the, overall, embodied, energy, of, concrete, at, roughly, 1, to, 1, 5, megajoules, per, kilogram, is, therefore, lower, than, for, many, structural, and, construction, materials, once, in, place, concrete, offers, a, great, energy, efficiency, over, the, lifetime, of, a, building, concrete, walls, leak, air, far, less, than, those, made, of, wood, frames, air, leakage, accounts, for, a, large, percentage, of, energy, loss, from, a, home, the, thermal, mass, properties, of, concrete, increase, the, efficiency, of, both, residential, and, commercial, buildings, by, storing, and, releasing, the, energy, needed, for, heating, or, cooling, concrete, s, thermal, mass, delivers, year, round, benefits, by, reducing, temperature, swings, inside, and, minimizing, heating, and, cooling, costs, while, insulation, reduces, energy, loss, through, the, building, envelope, thermal, mass, uses, walls, to, store, and, release, energy, modern, concrete, wall, systems, use, both, external, insulation, and, thermal, mass, to, create, an, energy, efficient, building, insulating, concrete, forms, icfs, are, hollow, blocks, or, panels, made, of, either, insulating, foam, or, rastra, that, are, stacked, to, form, the, shape, of, the, walls, of, a, building, and, then, filled, with, reinforced, concrete, to, create, the, structure, concrete, buildings, are, more, resistant, to, fire, than, those, constructed, using, steel, frames, since, concrete, has, lower, heat, conductivity, than, steel, and, can, thus, last, longer, under, the, same, fire, conditions, concrete, is, sometimes, used, as, a, fire, protection, for, steel, frames, for, the, same, effect, as, above, concrete, as, a, fire, shield, for, example, fondu, fyre, can, also, be, used, in, extreme, environments, like, a, missile, launch, pad, options, for, non, combustible, construction, include, floors, ceilings, and, roofs, made, of, cast, in, place, and, hollow, core, precast, concrete, for, walls, concrete, masonry, technology, and, insulating, concrete, forms, icfs, are, additional, options, icfs, are, hollow, blocks, or, panels, made, of, fireproof, insulating, foam, that, are, stacked, to, form, the, shape, of, the, walls, of, a, building, and, then, filled, with, reinforced, concrete, to, create, the, structure, concrete, also, provides, good, resistance, against, externally, applied, forces, such, as, high, winds, hurricanes, and, tornadoes, owing, to, its, lateral, stiffness, which, results, in, minimal, horizontal, movement, however, this, stiffness, can, work, against, certain, types, of, concrete, structures, particularly, where, a, relatively, higher, flexing, structure, is, required, to, resist, more, extreme, forces, as, discussed, above, concrete, is, very, strong, in, compression, but, weak, in, tension, larger, earthquakes, can, generate, very, large, shear, loads, on, structures, these, shear, loads, subject, the, structure, to, both, tensile, and, compressional, loads, concrete, structures, without, reinforcement, like, other, unreinforced, masonry, structures, can, fail, during, severe, earthquake, shaking, unreinforced, masonry, structures, constitute, one, of, the, largest, earthquake, risks, globally, these, risks, can, be, reduced, through, seismic, retrofitting, of, at, risk, buildings, e, g, school, buildings, in, istanbul, turkey, concrete, is, one, of, the, most, durable, building, materials, it, provides, superior, fire, resistance, compared, with, wooden, construction, and, gains, strength, over, time, structures, made, of, concrete, can, have, a, long, service, life, concrete, is, used, more, than, any, other, artificial, material, in, the, world, as, of, 2006, about, 7, 5, billion, cubic, meters, of, concrete, are, made, each, year, more, than, one, cubic, meter, for, every, person, on, earth, the, use, of, reinforcement, in, the, form, of, iron, was, introduced, in, the, 1850s, by, french, industrialist, fran, ois, coignet, and, it, was, not, until, the, 1880s, that, german, civil, engineer, g, a, wayss, used, steel, as, reinforcement, concrete, is, a, relatively, brittle, material, that, is, strong, under, compression, but, less, in, tension, plain, unreinforced, concrete, is, unsuitable, for, many, structures, as, it, is, relatively, poor, at, withstanding, stresses, induced, by, vibrations, wind, loading, and, so, on, hence, to, increase, its, overall, strength, steel, rods, wires, mesh, or, cables, can, be, embedded, in, concrete, before, it, is, set, this, reinforcement, often, known, as, rebar, resists, tensile, forces, reinforced, concrete, rc, is, a, versatile, composite, and, one, of, the, most, widely, used, materials, in, modern, construction, it, is, made, up, of, different, constituent, materials, with, very, different, properties, that, complement, each, other, in, the, case, of, reinforced, concrete, the, component, materials, are, almost, always, concrete, and, steel, these, two, materials, form, a, strong, bond, together, and, are, able, to, resist, a, variety, of, applied, forces, effectively, acting, as, a, single, structural, element, reinforced, concrete, can, be, precast, or, cast, in, place, in, situ, concrete, and, is, used, in, a, wide, range, of, applications, such, as, slab, wall, beam, column, foundation, and, frame, construction, reinforcement, is, generally, placed, in, areas, of, the, concrete, that, are, likely, to, be, subject, to, tension, such, as, the, lower, portion, of, beams, usually, there, is, a, minimum, of, 50, mm, cover, both, above, and, below, the, steel, reinforcement, to, resist, spalling, and, corrosion, which, can, lead, to, structural, instability, other, types, of, non, steel, reinforcement, such, as, fibre, reinforced, concretes, are, used, for, specialized, applications, predominately, as, a, means, of, controlling, cracking, precast, concrete, is, concrete, which, is, cast, in, one, place, for, use, elsewhere, and, is, a, mobile, material, the, largest, part, of, precast, production, is, carried, out, in, the, works, of, specialist, suppliers, although, in, some, instances, due, to, economic, and, geographical, factors, scale, of, product, or, difficulty, of, access, the, elements, are, cast, on, or, adjacent, to, the, construction, site, precasting, offers, considerable, advantages, because, it, is, carried, out, in, a, controlled, environment, protected, from, the, elements, but, the, downside, of, this, is, the, contribution, to, greenhouse, gas, emission, from, transportation, to, the, construction, site, advantages, to, be, achieved, by, employing, precast, concrete, due, to, cement, s, exothermic, chemical, reaction, while, setting, up, large, concrete, structures, such, as, dams, navigation, locks, large, mat, foundations, and, large, breakwaters, generate, excessive, heat, during, hydration, and, associated, expansion, to, mitigate, these, effects, post, cooling, is, commonly, applied, during, construction, an, early, example, at, hoover, dam, used, a, network, of, pipes, between, vertical, concrete, placements, to, circulate, cooling, water, during, the, curing, process, to, avoid, damaging, overheating, similar, systems, are, still, used, depending, on, volume, of, the, pour, the, concrete, mix, used, and, ambient, air, temperature, the, cooling, process, may, last, for, many, months, after, the, concrete, is, placed, various, methods, also, are, used, to, pre, cool, the, concrete, mix, in, mass, concrete, structures, another, approach, to, mass, concrete, structures, that, minimizes, cement, s, thermal, by, product, is, the, use, of, roller, compacted, concrete, which, uses, a, dry, mix, which, has, a, much, lower, cooling, requirement, than, conventional, wet, placement, it, is, deposited, in, thick, layers, as, a, semi, dry, material, then, roller, compacted, into, a, dense, strong, mass, raw, concrete, surfaces, tend, to, be, porous, and, have, a, relatively, uninteresting, appearance, many, finishes, can, be, applied, to, improve, the, appearance, and, preserve, the, surface, against, staining, water, penetration, and, freezing, examples, of, improved, appearance, include, stamped, concrete, where, the, wet, concrete, has, a, pattern, impressed, on, the, surface, to, give, a, paved, cobbled, or, brick, like, effect, and, may, be, accompanied, with, coloration, another, popular, effect, for, flooring, and, table, tops, is, polished, concrete, where, the, concrete, is, polished, optically, flat, with, diamond, abrasives, and, sealed, with, polymers, or, other, sealants, other, finishes, can, be, achieved, with, chiseling, or, more, conventional, techniques, such, as, painting, or, covering, it, with, other, materials, the, proper, treatment, of, the, surface, of, concrete, and, therefore, its, characteristics, is, an, important, stage, in, the, construction, and, renovation, of, architectural, structures, prestressed, concrete, is, a, form, of, reinforced, concrete, that, builds, in, compressive, stresses, during, construction, to, oppose, tensile, stresses, experienced, in, use, this, can, greatly, reduce, the, weight, of, beams, or, slabs, by, better, distributing, the, stresses, in, the, structure, to, make, optimal, use, of, the, reinforcement, for, example, a, horizontal, beam, tends, to, sag, prestressed, reinforcement, along, the, bottom, of, the, beam, counteracts, this, in, pre, tensioned, concrete, the, prestressing, is, achieved, by, using, steel, or, polymer, tendons, or, bars, that, are, subjected, to, a, tensile, force, prior, to, casting, or, for, post, tensioned, concrete, after, casting, there, are, two, different, systems, being, used, more, than, 55, 000, miles, 89, 000, km, of, highways, in, the, united, states, are, paved, with, this, material, reinforced, concrete, prestressed, concrete, and, precast, concrete, are, the, most, widely, used, types, of, concrete, functional, extensions, in, modern, days, for, more, information, see, brutalist, architecture, once, mixed, concrete, is, typically, transported, to, the, place, where, it, is, intended, to, become, a, structural, item, various, methods, of, transportation, and, placement, are, used, depending, on, the, distances, involve, quantity, needed, and, other, details, of, application, large, amounts, are, often, transported, by, truck, poured, free, under, gravity, or, through, a, tremie, or, pumped, through, a, pipe, smaller, amounts, may, be, carried, in, a, skip, a, metal, container, which, can, be, tilted, or, opened, to, release, the, contents, usually, transported, by, crane, or, hoist, or, wheelbarrow, or, carried, in, toggle, bags, for, manual, placement, underwater, extreme, weather, conditions, extreme, heat, or, cold, windy, conditions, and, humidity, variations, can, significantly, alter, the, quality, of, concrete, many, precautions, are, observed, in, cold, weather, placement, low, temperatures, significantly, slow, the, chemical, reactions, involved, in, hydration, of, cement, thus, affecting, the, strength, development, preventing, freezing, is, the, most, important, precaution, as, formation, of, ice, crystals, can, cause, damage, to, the, crystalline, structure, of, the, hydrated, cement, paste, if, the, surface, of, the, concrete, pour, is, insulated, from, the, outside, temperatures, the, heat, of, hydration, will, prevent, freezing, the, american, concrete, institute, aci, definition, of, cold, weather, placement, aci, 306, is, in, canada, where, temperatures, tend, to, be, much, lower, during, the, cold, season, the, following, criteria, are, used, by, csa, a23, 1, the, minimum, strength, before, exposing, concrete, to, extreme, cold, is, 500, psi, 3, 4, mpa, csa, a, 23, 1, specified, a, compressive, strength, of, 7, 0, mpa, to, be, considered, safe, for, exposure, to, freezing, concrete, may, be, placed, and, cured, underwater, care, must, be, taken, in, the, placement, method, to, prevent, washing, out, the, cement, underwater, placement, methods, include, the, tremie, pumping, skip, placement, manual, placement, using, toggle, bags, and, bagwork, a, tremie, is, a, vertical, pipe, with, a, hopper, at, the, top, used, to, pour, concrete, underwater, in, a, way, that, avoids, washout, of, cement, from, the, mix, due, to, turbulent, water, contact, with, the, concrete, while, it, is, flowing, this, produces, a, more, reliable, strength, of, the, product, the, toggle, bag, method, is, generally, used, for, placing, small, quantities, and, for, repairs, wet, concrete, is, loaded, into, a, reusable, canvas, bag, and, squeezed, out, at, the, required, place, by, the, diver, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, washout, of, the, cement, and, fines, underwater, bagwork, is, the, manual, placement, by, divers, of, woven, cloth, bags, containing, dry, mix, followed, by, piercing, the, bags, with, steel, rebar, pins, to, tie, the, bags, together, after, every, two, or, three, layers, and, create, a, path, for, hydration, to, induce, curing, which, can, typically, take, about, 6, to, 12, hours, for, initial, hardening, and, full, hardening, by, the, next, day, bagwork, concrete, will, generally, reach, full, strength, within, 28, days, each, bag, must, be, pierced, by, at, least, one, and, preferably, up, to, four, pins, bagwork, is, a, simple, and, convenient, method, of, underwater, concrete, placement, which, does, not, require, pumps, plant, or, formwork, and, which, can, minimise, environmental, effects, from, dispersing, cement, in, the, water, prefilled, bags, are, available, which, are, sealed, to, prevent, premature, hydration, if, stored, in, suitable, dry, conditions, the, bags, may, be, biodegradable, grouted, aggregate, is, an, alternative, method, of, forming, a, concrete, mass, underwater, where, the, forms, are, filled, with, coarse, aggregate, and, the, voids, then, completely, filled, from, the, bottom, by, displacing, the, water, with, pumped, grout, concrete, roads, are, more, fuel, efficient, to, drive, on, more, reflective, and, last, significantly, longer, than, other, paving, surfaces, yet, have, a, much, smaller, market, share, than, other, paving, solutions, modern, paving, methods, and, design, practices, have, changed, the, economics, of, concrete, paving, so, that, a, well, designed, and, placed, concrete, pavement, will, be, less, expensive, on, initial, costs, and, significantly, less, expensive, over, the, life, cycle, another, major, benefit, is, that, pervious, concrete, can, be, used, which, eliminates, the, need, to, place, storm, drains, near, the, road, and, reducing, the, need, for, slightly, sloped, roadway, to, help, rainwater, to, run, off, no, longer, requiring, discarding, rainwater, through, use, of, drains, also, means, that, less, electricity, is, needed, more, pumping, is, otherwise, needed, in, the, water, distribution, system, and, no, rainwater, gets, polluted, as, it, no, longer, mixes, with, polluted, water, rather, it, is, immediately, absorbed, by, the, ground, the, manufacture, and, use, of, concrete, produce, a, wide, range, of, environmental, economic, and, social, impacts, grinding, of, concrete, can, produce, hazardous, dust, exposure, to, cement, dust, can, lead, to, issues, such, as, silicosis, kidney, disease, skin, irritation, and, similar, effects, the, u, s, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, in, the, united, states, recommends, attaching, local, exhaust, ventilation, shrouds, to, electric, concrete, grinders, to, control, the, spread, of, this, dust, in, addition, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, placed, more, stringent, regulations, on, companies, whose, workers, regularly, come, into, contact, with, silica, dust, an, updated, silica, rule, which, osha, put, into, effect, 23, september, 2017, for, construction, companies, restricted, the, amount, of, breathable, crystalline, silica, workers, could, legally, come, into, contact, with, to, 50, micro, grams, per, cubic, meter, of, air, per, 8, hour, workday, that, same, rule, went, into, effect, 23, june, 2018, for, general, industry, hydraulic, fracturing, and, maritime, that, deadline, was, extended, to, 23, june, 2021, for, engineering, controls, in, the, hydraulic, fracturing, industry, companies, which, fail, to, meet, the, tightened, safety, regulations, can, face, financial, charges, and, extensive, penalties, the, presence, of, some, substances, in, concrete, including, useful, and, unwanted, additives, can, cause, health, concerns, due, to, toxicity, and, radioactivity, fresh, concrete, before, curing, is, complete, is, highly, alkaline, and, must, be, handled, with, proper, protective, equipment, a, major, component, of, concrete, is, cement, a, fine, powder, used, mainly, to, bind, sand, and, coarser, aggregates, together, in, concrete, although, a, variety, of, cement, types, exist, the, most, common, is, portland, cement, which, is, produced, by, mixing, clinker, with, smaller, quantities, of, other, additives, such, as, gypsum, and, ground, limestone, the, production, of, clinker, the, main, constituent, of, cement, is, responsible, for, the, bulk, of, the, sector, s, greenhouse, gas, emissions, including, both, energy, intensity, and, process, emissions, the, cement, industry, is, one, of, the, three, primary, producers, of, carbon, dioxide, a, major, greenhouse, gas, the, other, two, being, energy, production, and, transportation, industries, on, average, every, tonne, of, cement, produced, releases, one, tonne, of, co, 2, into, the, atmosphere, pioneer, cement, manufacturers, have, claimed, to, reach, lower, carbon, intensities, with, 590, kg, of, co, 2, eq, per, tonne, of, cement, produced, the, emissions, are, due, to, combustion, and, calcination, processes, which, roughly, account, for, 40, and, 60, of, the, greenhouse, gases, respectively, considering, that, cement, is, only, a, fraction, of, the, constituents, of, concrete, it, is, estimated, that, a, tonne, of, concrete, is, responsible, for, emitting, about, 100, 200, kg, of, co, 2, every, year, more, than, 10, billion, tonnes, of, concrete, are, used, worldwide, in, the, coming, years, large, quantities, of, concrete, will, continue, to, be, used, and, the, mitigation, of, co, 2, emissions, from, the, sector, will, be, even, more, critical, concrete, is, used, to, create, hard, surfaces, that, contribute, to, surface, runoff, which, can, cause, heavy, soil, erosion, water, pollution, and, flooding, but, conversely, can, be, used, to, divert, dam, and, control, flooding, concrete, dust, released, by, building, demolition, and, natural, disasters, can, be, a, major, source, of, dangerous, air, pollution, concrete, is, a, contributor, to, the, urban, heat, island, effect, though, less, so, than, asphalt, reducing, the, cement, clinker, content, might, have, positive, effects, on, the, environmental, life, cycle, assessment, of, concrete, some, research, work, on, reducing, the, cement, clinker, content, in, concrete, has, already, been, carried, out, however, there, exist, different, research, strategies, often, replacement, of, some, clinker, for, large, amounts, of, slag, or, fly, ash, was, investigated, based, on, conventional, concrete, technology, this, could, lead, to, a, waste, of, scarce, raw, materials, such, as, slag, and, fly, ash, the, aim, of, other, research, activities, is, the, efficient, use, of, cement, and, reactive, materials, like, slag, and, fly, ash, in, concrete, based, on, a, modified, mix, design, approach, the, embodied, carbon, of, a, precast, concrete, facade, can, be, reduced, by, 50, when, using, the, presented, fiber, reinforced, high, performance, concrete, in, place, of, typical, reinforced, concrete, cladding, studies, have, been, conducted, about, commercialization, of, low, carbon, concretes, life, cycle, assessment, lca, of, low, carbon, concrete, was, investigated, according, to, the, ground, granulated, blast, furnace, slag, ggbs, and, fly, ash, fa, replacement, ratios, global, warming, potential, gwp, of, ggbs, decreased, by, 1, 1, kg, co, 2, eq, m, 3, while, fa, decreased, by, 17, 3, kg, co, 2, eq, m, 3, when, the, mineral, admixture, replacement, ratio, was, increased, by, 10, this, study, also, compared, the, compressive, strength, properties, of, binary, blended, low, carbon, concrete, according, to, the, replacement, ratios, and, the, applicable, range, of, mixing, proportions, was, derived, high, performance, building, materials, will, be, particularly, important, for, enhancing, resilience, including, for, flood, defenses, and, critical, infrastructure, protection, risks, to, infrastructure, and, cities, posed, by, extreme, weather, events, are, especially, serious, for, those, places, exposed, to, flood, and, hurricane, damage, but, also, where, residents, need, protection, from, extreme, summer, temperatures, traditional, concrete, can, come, under, strain, when, exposed, to, humidity, and, higher, concentrations, of, atmospheric, co, 2, while, concrete, is, likely, to, remain, important, in, applications, where, the, environment, is, challenging, novel, smarter, and, more, adaptable, materials, are, also, needed, the, world, record, for, the, largest, concrete, pour, in, a, single, project, is, the, three, gorges, dam, in, hubei, province, china, by, the, three, gorges, corporation, the, amount, of, concrete, used, in, the, construction, of, the, dam, is, estimated, at, 16, million, cubic, meters, over, 17, years, the, previous, record, was, 12, 3, million, cubic, meters, held, by, itaipu, hydropower, station, in, brazil, the, world, record, for, concrete, pumping, was, set, on, 7, august, 2009, during, the, construction, of, the, parbati, hydroelectric, project, near, the, village, of, suind, himachal, pradesh, india, when, the, concrete, mix, was, pumped, through, a, vertical, height, of, 715, m, 2, 346, ft, the, polavaram, dam, works, in, andhra, pradesh, on, 6, january, 2019, entered, the, guinness, world, records, by, pouring, 32, 100, cubic, metres, of, concrete, in, 24, hours, the, world, record, for, the, largest, continuously, poured, concrete, raft, was, achieved, in, august, 2007, in, abu, dhabi, by, contracting, firm, al, habtoor, ccc, joint, venture, and, the, concrete, supplier, is, unibeton, ready, mix, the, pour, a, part, of, the, foundation, for, the, abu, dhabi, s, landmark, tower, was, 16, 000, cubic, meters, of, concrete, poured, within, a, two, day, period, the, previous, record, 13, 200, cubic, meters, poured, in, 54, hours, despite, a, severe, tropical, storm, requiring, the, site, to, be, covered, with, tarpaulins, to, allow, work, to, continue, was, achieved, in, 1992, by, joint, japanese, and, south, korean, consortiums, hazama, corporation, and, the, samsung, c, t, corporation, for, the, construction, of, the, petronas, towers, in, kuala, lumpur, malaysia, the, world, record, for, largest, continuously, poured, concrete, floor, was, completed, 8, november, 1997, in, louisville, kentucky, by, design, build, firm, exxcel, project, management, the, monolithic, placement, consisted, of, 225, 000, square, feet, 20, 900, m, 2, of, concrete, placed, in, 30, hours, finished, to, a, flatness, tolerance, of, f, f, 54, 60, and, a,
