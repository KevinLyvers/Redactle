a, fuel, is, any, material, that, can, be, made, to, react, with, other, substances, so, that, it, releases, energy, as, thermal, energy, or, to, be, used, for, work, the, concept, was, originally, applied, solely, to, those, materials, capable, of, releasing, chemical, energy, but, has, since, also, been, applied, to, other, sources, of, heat, energy, such, as, nuclear, energy, via, nuclear, fission, and, nuclear, fusion, the, heat, energy, released, by, reactions, of, fuels, can, be, converted, into, mechanical, energy, via, a, heat, engine, other, times, the, heat, itself, is, valued, for, warmth, cooking, or, industrial, processes, as, well, as, the, illumination, that, accompanies, combustion, fuels, are, also, used, in, the, cells, of, organisms, in, a, process, known, as, cellular, respiration, where, organic, molecules, are, oxidized, to, release, usable, energy, hydrocarbons, and, related, organic, molecules, are, by, far, the, most, common, source, of, fuel, used, by, humans, but, other, substances, including, radioactive, metals, are, also, utilized, fuels, are, contrasted, with, other, substances, or, devices, storing, potential, energy, such, as, those, that, directly, release, electrical, energy, such, as, batteries, and, capacitors, or, mechanical, energy, such, as, flywheels, springs, compressed, air, or, water, in, a, reservoir, the, first, known, use, of, fuel, was, the, combustion, of, firewood, by, homo, erectus, nearly, two, million, years, ago, throughout, most, of, human, history, only, fuels, derived, from, plants, or, animal, fat, were, used, by, humans, charcoal, a, wood, derivative, has, been, used, since, at, least, 6, 000, bce, for, melting, metals, it, was, only, supplanted, by, coke, derived, from, coal, as, european, forests, started, to, become, depleted, around, the, 18th, century, charcoal, briquettes, are, now, commonly, used, as, a, fuel, for, barbecue, cooking, crude, oil, was, distilled, by, persian, chemists, with, clear, descriptions, given, in, arabic, handbooks, such, as, those, of, muhammad, ibn, zakar, ya, r, zi, he, described, the, process, of, distilling, crude, oil, petroleum, into, kerosene, as, well, as, other, hydrocarbon, compounds, in, his, kitab, al, asrar, book, of, secrets, kerosene, was, also, produced, during, the, same, period, from, oil, shale, and, bitumen, by, heating, the, rock, to, extract, the, oil, which, was, then, distilled, r, zi, also, gave, the, first, description, of, a, kerosene, lamp, using, crude, mineral, oil, referring, to, it, as, the, naffatah, the, streets, of, baghdad, were, paved, with, tar, derived, from, petroleum, that, became, accessible, from, natural, fields, in, the, region, in, the, 9th, century, oil, fields, were, exploited, in, the, area, around, modern, baku, azerbaijan, these, fields, were, described, by, the, arab, geographer, abu, al, hasan, al, al, mas, d, in, the, 10th, century, and, by, marco, polo, in, the, 13th, century, who, described, the, output, of, those, wells, as, hundreds, of, shiploads, with, the, development, of, the, steam, engine, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1769, coal, came, into, more, common, use, the, combustion, of, which, releases, chemical, energy, that, can, be, used, to, turn, water, into, steam, coal, was, later, used, to, drive, ships, and, locomotives, by, the, 19th, century, gas, extracted, from, coal, was, being, used, for, street, lighting, in, london, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, primary, use, of, coal, is, to, generate, electricity, providing, 40, of, the, world, s, electrical, power, supply, in, 2005, fossil, fuels, were, rapidly, adopted, during, the, industrial, revolution, because, they, were, more, concentrated, and, flexible, than, traditional, energy, sources, such, as, water, power, they, have, become, a, pivotal, part, of, our, contemporary, society, with, most, countries, in, the, world, burning, fossil, fuels, in, order, to, produce, power, but, are, falling, out, of, favor, due, to, the, global, warming, and, related, effects, that, are, caused, by, burning, them, currently, the, trend, has, been, towards, renewable, fuels, such, as, biofuels, like, alcohols, chemical, fuels, are, substances, that, release, energy, by, reacting, with, substances, around, them, most, notably, by, the, process, of, combustion, chemical, fuels, are, divided, in, two, ways, first, by, their, physical, properties, as, a, solid, liquid, or, gas, secondly, on, the, basis, of, their, occurrence, primary, natural, fuel, and, secondary, artificial, fuel, thus, a, general, classification, of, chemical, fuels, is, solid, fuel, refers, to, various, types, of, solid, material, that, are, used, as, fuel, to, produce, energy, and, provide, heating, usually, released, through, combustion, solid, fuels, include, wood, charcoal, peat, coal, hexamine, fuel, tablets, and, pellets, made, from, wood, see, wood, pellets, corn, wheat, rye, and, other, grains, solid, fuel, rocket, technology, also, uses, solid, fuel, see, solid, propellants, solid, fuels, have, been, used, by, humanity, for, many, years, to, create, fire, coal, was, the, fuel, source, which, enabled, the, industrial, revolution, from, firing, furnaces, to, running, steam, engines, wood, was, also, extensively, used, to, run, steam, locomotives, both, peat, and, coal, are, still, used, in, electricity, generation, today, the, use, of, some, solid, fuels, e, g, coal, is, restricted, or, prohibited, in, some, urban, areas, due, to, unsafe, levels, of, toxic, emissions, the, use, of, other, solid, fuels, as, wood, is, decreasing, as, heating, technology, and, the, availability, of, good, quality, fuel, improves, in, some, areas, smokeless, coal, is, often, the, only, solid, fuel, used, in, ireland, peat, briquettes, are, used, as, smokeless, fuel, they, are, also, used, to, start, a, coal, fire, liquid, fuels, are, combustible, or, energy, generating, molecules, that, can, be, harnessed, to, create, mechanical, energy, usually, producing, kinetic, energy, they, must, also, take, the, shape, of, their, container, the, fumes, of, liquid, fuels, are, flammable, not, the, fluids, most, liquid, fuels, in, widespread, use, are, derived, from, the, fossilized, remains, of, dead, plants, and, animals, by, exposure, to, heat, and, pressure, inside, the, earth, s, crust, however, there, are, several, types, such, as, hydrogen, fuel, for, automotive, uses, ethanol, jet, fuel, and, bio, diesel, which, are, all, categorized, as, liquid, fuels, emulsified, fuels, of, oil, in, water, such, as, orimulsion, have, been, developed, as, a, way, to, make, heavy, oil, fractions, usable, as, liquid, fuels, many, liquid, fuels, play, a, primary, role, in, transportation, and, the, economy, some, common, properties, of, liquid, fuels, are, that, they, are, easy, to, transport, and, can, be, handled, easily, they, are, also, relatively, easy, to, use, for, all, engineering, applications, and, in, home, use, fuels, like, kerosene, are, rationed, in, some, countries, for, example, in, government, subsidized, shops, in, india, for, home, use, conventional, diesel, is, similar, to, gasoline, in, that, it, is, a, mixture, of, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, extracted, from, petroleum, kerosene, is, used, in, kerosene, lamps, and, as, a, fuel, for, cooking, heating, and, small, engines, natural, gas, composed, chiefly, of, methane, can, only, exist, as, a, liquid, at, very, low, temperatures, regardless, of, pressure, which, limits, its, direct, use, as, a, liquid, fuel, in, most, applications, lp, gas, is, a, mixture, of, propane, and, butane, both, of, which, are, easily, compressible, gases, under, standard, atmospheric, conditions, it, offers, many, of, the, advantages, of, compressed, natural, gas, cng, but, is, denser, than, air, does, not, burn, as, cleanly, and, is, much, more, easily, compressed, commonly, used, for, cooking, and, space, heating, lp, gas, and, compressed, propane, are, seeing, increased, use, in, motorized, vehicles, propane, is, the, third, most, commonly, used, motor, fuel, globally, fuel, gas, is, any, one, of, a, number, of, fuels, that, are, gaseous, under, ordinary, conditions, many, fuel, gases, are, composed, of, hydrocarbons, such, as, methane, or, propane, hydrogen, carbon, monoxide, or, mixtures, thereof, such, gases, are, sources, of, potential, heat, energy, or, light, energy, that, can, be, readily, transmitted, and, distributed, through, pipes, from, the, point, of, origin, directly, to, the, place, of, consumption, fuel, gas, is, contrasted, with, liquid, fuels, and, from, solid, fuels, though, some, fuel, gases, are, liquefied, for, storage, or, transport, while, their, gaseous, nature, can, be, advantageous, avoiding, the, difficulty, of, transporting, solid, fuel, and, the, dangers, of, spillage, inherent, in, liquid, fuels, it, can, also, be, dangerous, it, is, possible, for, a, fuel, gas, to, be, undetected, and, collect, in, certain, areas, leading, to, the, risk, of, a, gas, explosion, for, this, reason, odorizers, are, added, to, most, fuel, gases, so, that, they, may, be, detected, by, a, distinct, smell, the, most, common, type, of, fuel, gas, in, current, use, is, natural, gas, biofuel, can, be, broadly, defined, as, solid, liquid, or, gas, fuel, consisting, of, or, derived, from, biomass, biomass, can, also, be, used, directly, for, heating, or, power, known, as, biomass, fuel, biofuel, can, be, produced, from, any, carbon, source, that, can, be, replenished, rapidly, e, g, plants, many, different, plants, and, plant, derived, materials, are, used, for, biofuel, manufacture, perhaps, the, earliest, fuel, employed, by, humans, is, wood, evidence, shows, controlled, fire, was, used, up, to, 1, 5, million, years, ago, at, swartkrans, south, africa, it, is, unknown, which, hominid, species, first, used, fire, as, both, australopithecus, and, an, early, species, of, homo, were, present, at, the, sites, as, a, fuel, wood, has, remained, in, use, up, until, the, present, day, although, it, has, been, superseded, for, many, purposes, by, other, sources, wood, has, an, energy, density, of, 10, 20, mj, kg, recently, biofuels, have, been, developed, for, use, in, automotive, transport, for, example, bioethanol, and, biodiesel, but, there, is, widespread, public, debate, about, how, carbon, neutral, these, fuels, are, fossil, fuels, are, hydrocarbons, primarily, coal, and, petroleum, liquid, petroleum, or, natural, gas, formed, from, the, fossilized, remains, of, ancient, plants, and, animals, by, exposure, to, high, heat, and, pressure, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, in, the, earth, s, crust, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, commonly, the, term, fossil, fuel, also, includes, hydrocarbon, containing, natural, resources, that, are, not, derived, entirely, from, biological, sources, such, as, tar, sands, these, latter, sources, are, properly, known, as, mineral, fuels, fossil, fuels, contain, high, percentages, of, carbon, and, include, coal, petroleum, and, natural, gas, they, range, from, volatile, materials, with, low, carbon, hydrogen, ratios, like, methane, to, liquid, petroleum, to, nonvolatile, materials, composed, of, almost, pure, carbon, like, anthracite, coal, methane, can, be, found, in, hydrocarbon, fields, alone, associated, with, oil, or, in, the, form, of, methane, clathrates, fossil, fuels, formed, from, the, fossilized, remains, of, dead, plants, by, exposure, to, heat, and, pressure, in, the, earth, s, crust, over, millions, of, years, this, biogenic, theory, was, first, introduced, by, german, scholar, georg, agricola, in, 1556, and, later, by, mikhail, lomonosov, in, the, 18th, century, it, was, estimated, by, the, energy, information, administration, that, in, 2007, primary, sources, of, energy, consisted, of, petroleum, 36, 0, coal, 27, 4, natural, gas, 23, 0, amounting, to, an, 86, 4, share, for, fossil, fuels, in, primary, energy, consumption, in, the, world, non, fossil, sources, in, 2006, included, hydroelectric, 6, 3, nuclear, 8, 5, and, others, geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste, amounting, to, 0, 9, world, energy, consumption, was, growing, about, 2, 3, per, year, fossil, fuels, are, non, renewable, resources, because, they, take, millions, of, years, to, form, and, reserves, are, being, depleted, much, faster, than, new, ones, are, being, made, so, we, must, conserve, these, fuels, and, use, them, judiciously, the, production, and, use, of, fossil, fuels, raise, environmental, concerns, a, global, movement, toward, the, generation, of, renewable, energy, is, therefore, under, way, to, help, meet, increased, energy, needs, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, produces, around, 21, 3, billion, tonnes, 21, 3, gigatonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, per, year, but, it, is, estimated, that, natural, processes, can, only, absorb, about, half, of, that, amount, so, there, is, a, net, increase, of, 10, 65, billion, tonnes, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, per, year, one, tonne, of, atmospheric, carbon, is, equivalent, to, 44, 12, this, is, the, ratio, of, the, molecular, atomic, weights, or, 3, 7, tonnes, of, co, 2, carbon, dioxide, is, one, of, the, greenhouse, gases, that, enhances, radiative, forcing, and, contributes, to, global, warming, causing, the, average, surface, temperature, of, the, earth, to, rise, in, response, which, the, vast, majority, of, climate, scientists, agree, will, cause, major, adverse, effects, fuels, are, a, source, of, energy, the, amount, of, energy, from, different, types, of, fuel, depends, on, the, stoichiometric, ratio, the, chemically, correct, air, and, fuel, ratio, to, ensure, complete, combustion, of, fuel, and, its, specific, energy, the, energy, per, unit, mass, 1, mj, 0, 28, kwh, 0, 37, hph, the, fuel, air, ratio, far, is, the, reciprocal, of, the, air, fuel, ratio, afr, is, the, air, fuel, equivalence, ratio, and, 1, means, that, it, is, assumed, that, the, fuel, and, the, oxidising, agent, oxygen, in, air, are, present, in, exactly, the, correct, proportions, so, that, they, are, both, fully, consumed, in, the, reaction, nuclear, fuel, is, any, material, that, is, consumed, to, derive, nuclear, energy, in, theory, a, wide, variety, of, substances, could, be, a, nuclear, fuel, as, they, can, be, made, to, release, nuclear, energy, under, the, right, conditions, however, the, materials, commonly, referred, to, as, nuclear, fuels, are, those, that, will, produce, energy, without, being, placed, under, extreme, duress, nuclear, fuel, can, be, burned, by, nuclear, fission, splitting, nuclei, apart, or, fusion, combining, nuclei, together, to, derive, nuclear, energy, nuclear, fuel, can, refer, to, the, fuel, itself, or, to, physical, objects, for, example, bundles, composed, of, fuel, rods, composed, of, the, fuel, material, mixed, with, structural, neutron, moderating, or, neutron, reflecting, materials, nuclear, fuel, has, the, highest, energy, density, of, all, practical, fuel, sources, the, most, common, type, of, nuclear, fuel, used, by, humans, is, heavy, fissile, elements, that, can, be, made, to, undergo, nuclear, fission, chain, reactions, in, a, nuclear, fission, reactor, nuclear, fuel, can, refer, to, the, material, or, to, physical, objects, for, example, fuel, bundles, composed, of, fuel, rods, composed, of, the, fuel, material, perhaps, mixed, with, structural, neutron, moderating, or, neutron, reflecting, materials, when, some, of, these, fuels, are, struck, by, neutrons, they, are, in, turn, capable, of, emitting, neutrons, when, they, break, apart, this, makes, possible, a, self, sustaining, chain, reaction, that, releases, energy, at, a, controlled, rate, in, a, nuclear, reactor, or, at, a, very, rapid, uncontrolled, rate, in, a, nuclear, weapon, the, most, common, fissile, nuclear, fuels, are, uranium, 235, 235, u, and, plutonium, 239, 239, pu, the, actions, of, mining, refining, purifying, using, and, ultimately, disposing, of, nuclear, fuel, together, make, up, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, not, all, types, of, nuclear, fuels, create, energy, from, nuclear, fission, plutonium, 238, and, some, other, elements, are, used, to, produce, small, amounts, of, nuclear, energy, by, radioactive, decay, in, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, and, other, types, of, atomic, batteries, in, contrast, to, fission, some, light, nuclides, such, as, tritium, 3, h, can, be, used, as, fuel, for, nuclear, fusion, this, involves, two, or, more, nuclei, combining, into, larger, nuclei, fuels, that, produce, energy, by, this, method, are, currently, not, utilized, by, humans, but, they, are, the, main, source, of, fuel, for, stars, fusion, fuels, are, light, elements, such, as, hydrogen, whose, nucleii, will, combine, easily, energy, is, required, to, start, fusion, by, raising, the, temperature, so, high, that, nuclei, can, collide, together, with, enough, energy, that, they, stick, together, before, repelling, due, to, electric, charge, this, process, is, called, fusion, and, it, can, give, out, energy, in, stars, that, undergo, nuclear, fusion, fuel, consists, of, atomic, nuclei, that, can, release, energy, by, the, absorption, of, a, proton, or, neutron, in, most, stars, the, fuel, is, provided, by, hydrogen, which, can, combine, to, form, helium, through, the, proton, proton, chain, reaction, or, by, the, cno, cycle, when, the, hydrogen, fuel, is, exhausted, nuclear, fusion, can, continue, with, progressively, heavier, elements, although, the, net, energy, released, is, lower, because, of, the, smaller, difference, in, nuclear, binding, energy, once, iron, 56, or, nickel, 56, nuclei, are, produced, no, further, energy, can, be, obtained, by, nuclear, fusion, as, these, have, the, highest, nuclear, binding, energies, any, nucleii, heavier, than, 56, fe, and, 56, ni, would, thus, absorb, energy, instead, of, giving, it, off, when, fused, therefore, fusion, stops, and, the, star, dies, in, attempts, by, humans, fusion, is, only, carried, out, with, hydrogen, 2, h, deuterium, or, 3, h, tritium, to, form, helium, 4, as, this, reaction, gives, out, the, most, net, energy, electric, confinement, iter, inertial, confinement, heating, by, laser, and, heating, by, strong, electric, currents, are, the, popular, methods, most, transportation, fuels, are, liquids, because, vehicles, usually, require, high, energy, density, this, occurs, naturally, in, liquids, and, solids, high, energy, density, can, also, be, provided, by, an, internal, combustion, engine, these, engines, require, clean, burning, fuels, the, fuels, that, are, easiest, to, burn, cleanly, are, typically, liquids, and, gases, thus, liquids, meet, the, requirements, of, being, both, energy, dense, and, clean, burning, in, addition, liquids, and, gases, can, be, pumped, which, means, handling, is, easily, mechanized, and, thus, less, laborious, as, there, is, a, general, movement, towards, a, low, carbon, economy, the, use, of, liquid, fuels, such, as, hydrocarbons, is, coming, under, scrutiny
