in, woodworking, and, construction, a, nail, is, a, small, object, made, of, metal, or, wood, called, a, tree, nail, or, trunnel, which, is, used, as, a, fastener, as, a, peg, to, hang, something, or, sometimes, as, a, decoration, generally, nails, have, a, sharp, point, on, one, end, and, a, flattened, head, on, the, other, but, headless, nails, are, available, nails, are, made, in, a, great, variety, of, forms, for, specialized, purposes, the, most, common, is, a, wire, nail, other, types, of, nails, include, pins, tacks, brads, spikes, and, cleats, nails, are, typically, driven, into, the, workpiece, by, a, hammer, or, nail, gun, a, nail, holds, materials, together, by, friction, in, the, axial, direction, and, shear, strength, laterally, the, point, of, the, nail, is, also, sometimes, bent, over, or, clinched, after, driving, to, prevent, pulling, out, the, history, of, the, nail, is, divided, roughly, into, three, distinct, periods, from, the, late, 1700s, to, the, mid, 1900s, nail, prices, fell, by, a, factor, of, 10, since, then, nail, prices, have, increased, slightly, reflecting, in, part, an, upturn, in, materials, prices, and, a, shift, toward, specialty, nails, in, hand, working, of, nails, a, smith, works, an, approximately, conical, iron, pin, tapering, to, a, point, this, is, then, inserted, into, a, nail, header, also, known, as, a, nail, plate, essentially, a, plate, of, iron, with, a, small, hole, in, it, the, broad, end, of, the, pin, is, slightly, wider, than, the, hole, of, the, nail, header, the, smith, fits, the, pin, into, the, hole, of, the, nail, header, and, then, hammers, the, broad, end, of, the, pin, unable, to, advance, through, the, hole, the, broad, end, is, flattened, against, the, nail, header, to, create, a, nail, head, in, at, least, some, metalworking, traditions, nail, headers, might, have, been, identical, to, draw, plates, a, plate, bored, with, tapering, holes, of, different, sizes, through, which, wire, can, be, drawn, to, extrude, it, to, increasingly, fine, proportions, the, bible, provides, a, number, of, references, to, nails, including, the, story, in, judges, of, jael, the, wife, of, heber, who, drives, a, nail, or, tent, peg, into, the, temple, of, a, sleeping, canaanite, commander, the, provision, of, iron, for, nails, by, king, david, for, what, would, become, solomon, s, temple, and, in, connection, with, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, christ, the, romans, made, extensive, use, of, nails, the, roman, army, for, example, left, behind, seven, tons, of, nails, when, it, evacuated, the, fortress, of, inchtuthil, in, perthshire, in, scotland, in, 86, to, 87, ce, the, term, penny, as, it, refers, to, nails, probably, originated, in, medieval, england, to, describe, the, price, of, a, hundred, nails, nails, themselves, were, sufficiently, valuable, and, standardized, to, be, used, as, an, informal, medium, of, exchange, until, around, 1800, artisans, known, as, nailers, or, nailors, made, nails, by, hand, note, the, surname, naylor, workmen, called, slitters, cut, up, iron, bars, to, a, suitable, size, for, nailers, to, work, on, from, the, late, 16th, century, manual, slitters, disappeared, with, the, rise, of, the, slitting, mill, which, cut, bars, of, iron, into, rods, with, an, even, cross, section, saving, much, manual, effort, at, the, time, of, the, american, revolution, england, was, the, largest, manufacturer, of, nails, in, the, world, nails, were, expensive, and, difficult, to, obtain, in, the, american, colonies, so, that, abandoned, houses, were, sometimes, deliberately, burned, down, to, allow, recovery, of, used, nails, from, the, ashes, this, became, such, a, problem, in, virginia, that, a, law, was, created, to, stop, people, from, burning, their, houses, when, they, moved, families, often, had, small, nail, manufacturing, setups, in, their, homes, during, bad, weather, and, at, night, the, entire, family, might, work, at, making, nails, for, their, own, use, and, for, barter, thomas, jefferson, wrote, in, a, letter, in, our, private, pursuits, it, is, a, great, advantage, that, every, honest, employment, is, deemed, honorable, i, am, myself, a, nail, maker, the, growth, of, the, trade, in, the, american, colonies, was, theoretically, held, back, by, the, prohibition, of, new, slitting, mills, in, america, by, the, iron, act, of, 1750, though, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, act, was, actually, enforced, the, production, of, wrought, iron, nails, continued, well, into, the, 19th, century, but, ultimately, was, reduced, to, nails, for, purposes, for, which, the, softer, cut, nails, were, unsuitable, including, horseshoe, nails, the, slitting, mill, introduced, to, england, in, 1590, simplified, the, production, of, nail, rods, but, the, real, first, efforts, to, mechanise, the, nail, making, process, itself, occurred, between, 1790, and, 1820, initially, in, england, and, the, united, states, when, various, machines, were, invented, to, automate, and, speed, up, the, process, of, making, nails, from, bars, of, wrought, iron, also, in, sweden, in, the, early, 1700s, christopher, polhem, produced, a, nail, cutting, machine, as, part, of, his, automated, factory, these, nails, were, known, as, cut, nails, because, they, were, produced, by, cutting, iron, bars, into, rods, they, were, also, known, as, square, nails, because, of, their, roughly, rectangular, cross, section, the, cut, nail, process, was, patented, in, the, u, s, by, jacob, perkins, in, 1795, and, in, england, by, joseph, dyer, who, set, up, machinery, in, birmingham, the, process, was, designed, to, cut, nails, from, sheets, of, iron, while, making, sure, that, the, fibres, of, the, iron, ran, down, the, nails, the, birmingham, industry, expanded, in, the, following, decades, and, reached, its, greatest, extent, in, the, 1860s, after, which, it, declined, due, to, competition, from, wire, nails, but, continued, until, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, cut, nails, were, one, of, the, important, factors, in, the, increase, in, balloon, framing, beginning, in, the, 1830s, and, thus, the, decline, of, timber, framing, with, wooden, joints, though, still, used, for, historical, renovations, and, for, heavy, duty, applications, such, as, attaching, boards, to, masonry, walls, cut, nails, are, much, less, common, today, than, wire, nails, wire, nails, are, formed, from, wire, usually, coils, of, wire, are, drawn, through, a, series, of, dies, to, reach, a, specific, diameter, then, cut, into, short, rods, that, are, then, formed, into, nails, the, nail, tip, is, usually, cut, by, a, blade, the, head, is, formed, by, reshaping, the, other, end, of, the, rod, under, high, pressure, other, dies, are, used, to, cut, grooves, and, ridges, wire, nails, were, also, known, as, french, nails, for, their, country, of, origin, belgian, wire, nails, began, to, compete, in, england, in, 1863, joseph, henry, nettlefold, was, making, wire, nails, at, smethwick, by, 1875, over, the, following, decades, the, nail, making, process, was, almost, completely, automated, eventually, the, industry, had, machines, capable, of, quickly, producing, huge, numbers, of, inexpensive, nails, with, little, or, no, human, intervention, with, the, introduction, of, cheap, wire, nails, the, use, of, wrought, iron, for, nail, making, quickly, declined, as, more, slowly, did, the, production, of, cut, nails, in, the, united, states, in, 1892, more, steel, wire, nails, were, produced, than, cut, nails, in, 1913, 90, of, manufactured, nails, were, wire, nails, nails, went, from, being, rare, and, precious, to, being, a, cheap, mass, produced, commodity, today, almost, all, nails, are, manufactured, from, wire, but, the, term, wire, nail, has, come, to, refer, to, smaller, nails, often, available, in, a, wider, more, precise, range, of, gauges, than, is, typical, for, larger, common, and, finish, nails, today, many, nails, are, made, using, the, modern, rotary, principle, nail, machine, which, allows, wire, feeding, wire, cutting, and, nail, head, forming, to, take, place, in, one, continuous, process, of, rotating, movements, nails, were, formerly, made, of, bronze, or, wrought, iron, and, were, crafted, by, blacksmiths, and, nailors, these, crafts, people, used, a, heated, square, iron, rod, that, they, forged, before, they, hammered, the, sides, which, formed, a, point, after, reheating, and, cutting, off, the, blacksmith, or, nailor, inserted, the, hot, nail, into, an, opening, and, hammered, it, later, new, ways, of, making, nails, were, created, using, machines, to, shear, the, nails, before, wiggling, the, bar, sideways, to, produce, a, shank, for, example, the, type, a, cut, nails, were, sheared, from, an, iron, bar, type, guillotine, using, early, machinery, this, method, was, slightly, altered, until, the, 1820s, when, new, heads, on, the, nails, ends, were, pounded, via, a, separate, mechanical, nail, heading, machine, in, the, 1810s, iron, bars, were, flipped, over, after, each, stroke, while, the, cutter, set, was, at, an, angle, every, nail, was, then, sheared, off, of, taper, allowing, for, an, automatic, grip, of, each, nail, which, also, formed, their, heads, type, b, nails, were, created, this, way, in, 1886, 10, percent, of, the, nails, that, were, made, in, the, united, states, were, of, the, soft, steel, wire, variety, and, by, 1892, steel, wire, nails, overtook, iron, cut, nails, as, the, main, type, of, nails, that, were, being, produced, in, 1913, wire, nails, were, 90, percent, of, all, nails, that, were, produced, today, s, nails, are, typically, made, of, steel, often, dipped, or, coated, to, prevent, corrosion, in, harsh, conditions, or, to, improve, adhesion, ordinary, nails, for, wood, are, usually, of, a, soft, low, carbon, or, mild, steel, about, 0, 1, carbon, the, rest, iron, and, perhaps, a, trace, of, silicon, or, manganese, nails, for, masonry, applications, are, tempered, and, have, a, higher, carbon, content, types, of, nail, include, most, countries, except, the, united, states, use, a, metric, system, for, describing, nail, sizes, a, 50, 3, 0, indicates, a, nail, 50, mm, long, not, including, the, head, and, 3, mm, in, diameter, lengths, are, rounded, to, the, nearest, millimetre, for, example, finishing, nail, sizes, typically, available, from, german, suppliers, are, in, the, united, states, the, length, of, a, nail, is, designated, by, its, penny, size, nails, have, been, used, in, art, such, as, the, nail, men, a, form, of, fundraising, common, in, germany, and, austria, during, world, war, i, before, the, 1850s, bocce, and, p, tanque, boules, were, wooden, balls, sometimes, partially, reinforced, with, hand, forged, nails, when, cheap, plentiful, machine, made, nails, became, available, manufacturers, began, to, produce, the, boule, clout, e, a, wooden, core, studded, with, nails, to, create, an, all, metal, surface, nails, of, different, metals, and, colors, steel, brass, and, copper, were, used, to, create, a, wide, variety, of, designs, and, patterns, some, of, the, old, boules, clout, es, are, genuine, works, of, art, and, valued, collector, s, items, once, nails, became, cheap, and, widely, available, they, were, often, used, in, folk, art, and, outsider, art, as, a, method, of, decorating, a, surface, with, metallic, studs, another, common, artistic, use, is, the, construction, of, sculpture, from, welded, or, brazed, nails, nails, were, sometimes, inscribed, with, incantations, or, signs, intended, for, religious, or, mystical, benefit, used, at, shrines, or, on, the, doors, of, houses, for, protection
