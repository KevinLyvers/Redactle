the, four, cardinal, directions, or, cardinal, points, are, the, four, main, compass, directions, north, south, east, and, west, commonly, denoted, by, their, initials, n, s, e, and, w, respectively, relative, to, north, the, directions, east, south, and, west, are, at, 90, degree, intervals, in, the, clockwise, direction, the, ordinal, directions, also, called, the, intercardinal, directions, are, northeast, ne, southeast, se, southwest, sw, and, northwest, nw, the, intermediate, direction, of, every, set, of, intercardinal, and, cardinal, direction, is, called, a, secondary, intercardinal, direction, these, eight, shortest, points, in, the, compass, rose, shown, to, the, right, are, points, between, the, cardinal, directions, form, the, points, of, the, compass, arbitrary, horizontal, directions, may, be, indicated, by, their, azimuth, angle, value, the, directional, names, are, routinely, associated, with, azimuths, the, angle, of, rotation, in, degrees, in, the, unit, circle, over, the, horizontal, plane, it, is, a, necessary, step, for, navigational, calculations, derived, from, trigonometry, and, for, use, with, global, positioning, system, gps, receivers, the, four, cardinal, directions, correspond, to, the, following, degrees, of, a, compass, the, intercardinal, intermediate, or, historically, ordinal, directions, are, the, four, intermediate, compass, directions, located, halfway, between, each, pair, of, cardinal, directions, these, eight, directional, names, have, been, further, compounded, known, as, tertiary, intercardinal, directions, resulting, in, a, total, of, 32, named, points, evenly, spaced, around, the, compass, north, n, north, by, east, nbe, north, northeast, nne, northeast, by, north, nebn, northeast, ne, northeast, by, east, nebe, east, northeast, ene, east, by, north, ebn, east, e, etc, cardinal, directions, or, cardinal, points, may, sometimes, be, extended, to, include, vertical, position, elevation, altitude, depth, north, and, south, east, and, west, up, and, down, or, mathematically, the, six, directions, of, the, x, y, and, z, axes, in, three, dimensional, cartesian, coordinates, topographic, maps, include, elevation, typically, via, contour, lines, alternatively, elevation, angle, may, be, combined, with, cardinal, direction, or, more, generally, arbitrary, azimuth, angle, to, form, a, local, spherical, coordinate, system, in, astronomy, the, cardinal, points, of, an, astronomical, body, as, seen, in, the, sky, are, four, points, defined, by, the, directions, toward, which, the, celestial, poles, lie, relative, to, the, center, of, the, disk, of, the, object, in, the, sky, a, line, a, great, circle, on, the, celestial, sphere, from, the, center, of, the, disk, to, the, north, celestial, pole, will, intersect, the, edge, of, the, body, the, limb, at, the, north, point, the, north, point, will, then, be, the, point, on, the, limb, that, is, closest, to, the, north, celestial, pole, similarly, a, line, from, the, center, to, the, south, celestial, pole, will, define, the, south, point, by, its, intersection, with, the, limb, the, points, at, right, angles, to, the, north, and, south, points, are, the, east, and, west, points, going, around, the, disk, clockwise, from, the, north, point, one, encounters, in, order, the, west, point, the, south, point, and, then, the, east, point, this, is, opposite, to, the, order, on, a, terrestrial, map, because, one, is, looking, up, instead, of, down, similarly, when, describing, the, location, of, one, astronomical, object, relative, to, another, north, means, closer, to, the, north, celestial, pole, east, means, at, a, higher, right, ascension, south, means, closer, to, the, south, celestial, pole, and, west, means, at, a, lower, right, ascension, if, one, is, looking, at, two, stars, that, are, below, the, north, star, for, example, the, one, that, is, east, will, actually, be, further, to, the, left, during, the, migration, period, the, germanic, names, for, the, cardinal, directions, entered, the, romance, languages, where, they, replaced, the, latin, names, borealis, or, septentrionalis, with, north, australis, or, meridionalis, with, south, occidentalis, with, west, and, orientalis, with, east, it, is, possible, that, some, northern, people, used, the, germanic, names, for, the, intermediate, directions, medieval, scandinavian, orientation, would, thus, have, involved, a, 45, degree, rotation, of, cardinal, directions, in, many, regions, of, the, world, prevalent, winds, change, direction, seasonally, and, consequently, many, cultures, associate, specific, named, winds, with, cardinal, and, intercardinal, directions, for, example, classical, greek, culture, characterized, these, winds, as, anemoi, in, pre, modern, europe, more, generally, between, eight, and, 32, points, of, the, compass, cardinal, and, intercardinal, directions, were, given, names, these, often, corresponded, to, the, directional, winds, of, the, mediterranean, sea, for, example, southeast, was, linked, to, the, sirocco, a, wind, from, the, sahara, particular, colors, are, associated, in, some, traditions, with, the, cardinal, points, these, are, typically, natural, colors, of, human, perception, rather, than, optical, primary, colors, many, cultures, especially, in, asia, include, the, center, as, a, fifth, cardinal, point, central, asian, eastern, european, and, north, east, asian, cultures, frequently, have, traditions, associating, colors, with, four, or, five, cardinal, points, systems, with, five, cardinal, points, four, directions, and, the, center, include, those, from, pre, modern, china, as, well, as, traditional, turkic, tibetan, and, ainu, cultures, in, chinese, tradition, the, five, cardinal, point, system, is, related, to, i, ching, the, wu, xing, and, the, five, naked, eye, planets, in, traditional, chinese, astrology, the, zodiacal, belt, is, divided, into, the, four, constellation, groups, corresponding, to, the, directions, each, direction, is, often, identified, with, a, color, and, at, least, in, china, with, a, mythological, creature, of, that, color, geographical, or, ethnic, terms, may, contain, the, name, of, the, color, instead, of, the, name, of, the, corresponding, direction, east, green, q, ng, corresponds, to, both, green, and, blue, spring, wood, south, red, summer, fire, west, white, autumn, metal, north, black, winter, water, center, yellow, earth, countries, where, arabic, is, used, refer, to, the, cardinal, directions, as, ash, shamal, n, al, gharb, w, ash, sharq, e, and, al, janoob, s, additionally, al, wusta, is, used, for, the, center, all, five, are, used, for, geographic, subdivision, names, wilayahs, states, regions, governorates, provinces, districts, or, even, towns, and, some, are, the, origin, of, some, southern, iberian, place, names, such, as, algarve, portugal, and, axarqu, a, spain, in, mesoamerica, and, north, america, a, number, of, traditional, indigenous, cosmologies, include, four, cardinal, directions, and, a, center, some, may, also, include, above, and, below, as, directions, and, therefore, focus, on, a, cosmology, of, seven, directions, among, the, hopi, of, the, southwestern, united, states, the, four, named, cardinal, directions, are, not, north, south, east, and, west, but, are, the, four, directions, associated, with, the, places, of, sunrise, and, sunset, at, the, winter, and, summer, solstices, each, direction, may, be, associated, with, a, color, which, can, vary, widely, between, nations, but, which, is, usually, one, of, the, basic, colors, found, in, nature, and, natural, pigments, such, as, black, red, white, and, yellow, with, occasional, appearances, of, blue, green, or, other, hues, there, can, be, great, variety, in, color, symbolism, even, among, cultures, that, are, close, neighbors, geographically, ten, hindu, deities, known, as, the, dikp, las, have, been, recognized, in, classical, indian, scriptures, symbolizing, the, four, cardinal, and, four, intercardinal, directions, with, the, additional, directions, of, up, and, down, each, of, the, ten, directions, has, its, own, name, in, sanskrit, some, indigenous, australians, have, cardinal, directions, deeply, embedded, in, their, culture, for, example, the, warlpiri, people, have, a, cultural, philosophy, deeply, connected, to, the, four, cardinal, directions, and, the, guugu, yimithirr, people, use, cardinal, directions, rather, than, relative, direction, even, when, indicating, the, position, of, an, object, close, to, their, body, for, more, information, see, cultures, without, relative, directions, the, precise, direction, of, the, cardinal, points, appears, to, be, important, in, aboriginal, stone, arrangements, many, aboriginal, languages, contain, words, for, the, usual, four, cardinal, directions, but, some, contain, words, for, 5, or, even, 6, cardinal, directions, in, some, languages, such, as, estonian, finnish, and, breton, the, intercardinal, directions, have, names, that, are, not, compounds, of, the, names, of, the, cardinal, directions, as, for, instance, northeast, is, compounded, from, north, and, east, in, estonian, those, are, kirre, northeast, kagu, southeast, edel, southwest, and, loe, northwest, in, finnish, koillinen, northeast, kaakko, southeast, lounas, southwest, and, luode, northwest, in, japanese, there, is, the, interesting, situation, that, native, japanese, words, yamato, kotoba, kun, readings, of, kanji, are, used, for, the, cardinal, directions, such, as, minami, for, south, but, borrowed, chinese, words, on, readings, of, kanji, are, used, for, intercardinal, directions, such, as, t, nan, for, southeast, lit, east, south, in, the, malay, language, adding, laut, sea, to, either, east, timur, or, west, barat, results, in, northeast, or, northwest, respectively, whereas, adding, daya, to, west, giving, barat, daya, results, in, southwest, southeast, has, a, special, word, tenggara, sanskrit, and, other, indian, languages, that, borrow, from, it, use, the, names, of, the, gods, associated, with, each, direction, east, indra, southeast, agni, south, yama, dharma, southwest, nirrti, west, varuna, northwest, vayu, north, kubera, heaven, and, northeast, ishana, shiva, north, is, associated, with, the, himalayas, and, heaven, while, the, south, is, associated, with, the, underworld, or, land, of, the, fathers, pitr, loka, the, directions, are, named, by, adding, disha, to, the, names, of, each, god, or, entity, e, g, indradisha, direction, of, indra, or, pitrdisha, direction, of, the, forefathers, i, e, south, the, cardinal, directions, of, the, hopi, language, and, the, tewa, dialect, spoken, by, the, hopi, tewa, are, related, to, the, places, of, sunrise, and, sunset, at, the, solstices, and, correspond, approximately, to, the, european, intercardinal, directions, use, of, the, compass, directions, is, common, and, deeply, embedded, in, european, and, chinese, culture, see, south, pointing, chariot, some, other, cultures, make, greater, use, of, other, referents, such, as, toward, the, sea, or, toward, the, mountains, hawaii, bali, or, upstream, and, downstream, most, notably, in, ancient, egypt, also, in, the, yurok, and, karuk, languages, lengo, guadalcanal, solomon, islands, has, four, non, compass, directions, landward, seaward, upcoast, and, downcoast, some, languages, lack, words, for, body, relative, directions, such, as, left, right, and, use, geographical, directions, instead
