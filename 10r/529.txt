a, warship, or, combatant, ship, is, a, ship, that, is, used, for, naval, warfare, usually, they, belong, to, the, navy, branch, of, the, armed, forces, of, a, nation, though, they, have, also, been, operated, by, individuals, cooperatives, and, corporations, as, well, as, being, armed, warships, are, designed, to, withstand, damage, and, are, typically, faster, and, more, maneuverable, than, merchant, ships, unlike, a, merchant, ship, which, carries, cargo, a, warship, typically, carries, only, weapons, ammunition, and, supplies, for, its, crew, in, wartime, the, distinction, between, warships, and, merchant, ships, is, often, blurred, until, the, 17th, century, it, was, common, for, merchant, ships, to, be, pressed, into, naval, service, and, not, unusual, for, more, than, half, of, a, fleet, to, be, composed, of, merchant, ships, there, was, not, a, large, difference, in, construction, unlike, the, difference, between, a, heavily, armoured, battleship, and, an, ocean, liner, until, the, threat, of, piracy, subsided, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, normal, practice, to, arm, larger, merchant, ships, such, as, galleons, warships, have, also, often, been, used, as, troop, carriers, or, supply, ships, such, as, by, the, french, navy, in, the, 18th, century, or, the, imperial, japanese, navy, during, the, second, world, war, in, war, since, the, early, 20th, century, merchant, ships, were, often, armed, and, used, as, auxiliary, warships, such, as, the, q, ships, of, the, first, world, war, and, the, armed, merchant, cruisers, of, the, second, world, war, the, main, types, of, warships, today, are, in, order, of, decreasing, size, aircraft, carriers, amphibious, assault, ships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, fast, attack, boats, a, more, extensive, list, follows, the, first, evidence, of, ships, being, used, for, warfare, comes, from, ancient, egypt, specifically, the, northern, nile, river, most, likely, to, defend, against, mediterranean, peoples, the, galley, warship, most, likely, originated, in, crete, an, idea, which, was, soon, copied, and, popularized, by, the, phoenicians, in, the, time, of, mesopotamia, ancient, persia, phoenicia, ancient, greece, and, the, ancient, rome, warships, were, always, galleys, such, as, biremes, triremes, and, quinqueremes, long, narrow, vessels, powered, by, banks, of, oarsmen, and, designed, to, ram, and, sink, enemy, vessels, or, to, engage, them, bow, first, and, follow, up, with, boarding, parties, the, development, of, catapults, in, the, 4th, century, bc, and, the, subsequent, refinement, of, this, technology, enabled, the, first, fleets, of, siege, engine, equipped, warships, by, the, hellenistic, age, during, late, antiquity, ramming, fell, out, of, use, and, the, galley, tactics, against, other, ships, used, during, the, middle, ages, until, the, late, 16th, century, focused, on, boarding, naval, artillery, was, redeveloped, in, the, 14th, century, but, cannon, did, not, become, common, at, sea, until, the, guns, were, capable, of, being, reloaded, quickly, enough, to, be, reused, in, the, same, battle, the, size, of, a, ship, required, to, carry, a, large, number, of, cannons, made, oar, based, propulsion, impossible, and, warships, came, to, rely, primarily, on, sails, the, sailing, man, of, war, emerged, during, the, 16th, century, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, warships, were, carrying, increasing, numbers, of, cannons, on, their, broadsides, and, tactics, evolved, to, bring, each, ship, s, firepower, to, bear, in, a, line, of, battle, the, man, of, war, now, evolved, into, the, ship, of, the, line, in, the, 18th, century, the, frigate, and, sloop, of, war, too, small, to, stand, in, the, line, of, battle, evolved, to, escort, convoy, trade, scout, for, enemy, ships, and, blockade, enemy, coasts, during, the, 19th, century, a, revolution, took, place, in, the, means, of, marine, propulsion, naval, armament, and, construction, of, warships, marine, steam, engines, were, introduced, at, first, as, an, auxiliary, force, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, the, crimean, war, gave, a, great, stimulus, to, the, development, of, guns, the, introduction, of, explosive, shells, soon, led, to, the, introduction, of, iron, and, later, steel, naval, armour, for, the, sides, and, decks, of, larger, warships, the, first, ironclad, warships, the, french, gloire, and, british, warrior, made, wooden, vessels, obsolete, metal, soon, entirely, replaced, wood, as, the, main, material, for, warship, construction, from, the, 1850s, the, sailing, ships, of, the, line, were, replaced, by, steam, powered, battleships, while, the, sailing, frigates, were, replaced, by, steam, powered, cruisers, the, armament, of, warships, also, changed, with, the, invention, of, the, rotating, barbettes, and, turrets, which, allowed, the, guns, to, be, aimed, independently, of, the, direction, of, the, ship, and, allowed, a, smaller, number, of, larger, guns, to, be, carried, the, final, innovation, during, the, 19th, century, was, the, development, of, the, torpedo, and, development, of, the, torpedo, boat, small, fast, torpedo, boats, seemed, to, offer, an, alternative, to, building, expensive, fleets, of, battleships, pre, dreadnought, battleships, were, sea, going, battleships, built, between, the, mid, to, late, 1880s, and, 1905, before, the, launch, of, hms, dreadnought, in, 1906, the, pre, dreadnought, ships, replaced, the, ironclad, battleships, of, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, built, from, steel, protected, by, case, hardened, steel, armour, and, powered, by, coal, fired, triple, expansion, steam, engines, pre, dreadnought, battleships, carried, a, main, battery, of, very, heavy, guns, in, fully, enclosed, rotating, turrets, supported, by, one, or, more, secondary, batteries, of, lighter, weapons, the, role, of, corvettes, sloops, and, frigates, were, taken, by, new, types, of, ships, like, destroyers, protected, cruisers, and, armoured, cruisers, another, revolution, in, capital, warship, design, began, shortly, after, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, when, britain, launched, the, royal, navy, s, all, big, gun, battleship, dreadnought, in, 1906, powered, by, steam, turbines, it, was, bigger, faster, and, more, heavily, gunned, than, any, existing, battleships, which, it, immediately, rendered, obsolete, it, was, rapidly, followed, by, similar, ships, in, other, countries, the, royal, navy, also, developed, the, first, battlecruisers, mounting, the, same, heavy, guns, as, the, dreadnoughts, on, an, even, larger, hull, battlecruisers, sacrificed, armour, protection, for, speed, battlecruisers, were, faster, and, more, powerful, than, all, existing, cruisers, but, much, more, vulnerable, to, shellfire, than, contemporary, battleships, the, torpedo, boat, destroyer, was, developed, at, the, same, time, as, the, dreadnoughts, bigger, faster, and, more, heavily, gunned, than, the, torpedo, boat, the, destroyer, evolved, to, protect, the, capital, ships, from, the, menace, of, the, torpedo, boat, at, this, time, britain, also, introduced, the, use, of, fuel, oil, to, power, steam, warships, instead, of, coal, oil, produced, twice, as, much, power, per, unit, weight, as, coal, and, was, much, easier, to, handle, tests, were, conducted, by, the, royal, navy, in, 1904, involving, the, torpedo, boat, destroyer, spiteful, the, first, warship, powered, solely, by, fuel, oil, these, proved, its, superiority, and, all, warships, procured, for, the, royal, navy, from, 1912, were, designed, to, burn, fuel, oil, during, the, lead, up, to, the, second, world, war, germany, and, the, united, kingdom, once, again, emerged, as, the, two, dominant, atlantic, sea, powers, the, german, navy, under, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, limited, to, only, a, few, minor, surface, ships, but, the, clever, use, of, deceptive, terminology, such, as, panzerschiffe, deceived, the, british, and, french, commands, they, were, surprised, when, ships, such, as, admiral, graf, spee, scharnhorst, and, gneisenau, raided, allied, supply, lines, the, greatest, threat, however, was, the, introduction, of, the, kriegsmarine, s, largest, vessels, bismarck, and, tirpitz, bismarck, was, heavily, damaged, and, sunk, scuttled, after, a, series, of, sea, battles, in, the, north, atlantic, in, 1941, while, tirpitz, was, destroyed, by, the, royal, air, force, in, 1944, the, british, royal, navy, gained, dominance, of, the, european, theatre, by, 1943, the, second, world, war, brought, massive, changes, in, the, design, and, role, of, several, types, of, warships, for, the, first, time, the, aircraft, carrier, became, the, clear, choice, to, serve, as, the, main, capital, ship, within, a, naval, task, force, world, war, ii, was, the, only, war, in, history, in, which, battles, occurred, between, groups, of, carriers, world, war, ii, saw, the, first, use, of, radar, in, combat, it, brought, the, first, naval, battle, in, which, the, ships, of, both, sides, never, engaged, in, direct, combat, instead, sending, aircraft, to, make, the, attacks, as, in, the, battle, of, the, coral, sea, modern, warships, are, generally, divided, into, seven, main, categories, which, are, aircraft, carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and, amphibious, warfare, ships, battleships, comprise, an, eighth, category, but, are, not, in, current, service, with, any, navy, in, the, world, only, the, deactivated, american, iowa, class, battleships, still, exist, as, potential, combatants, and, battleships, in, general, are, unlikely, to, re, emerge, as, a, ship, class, without, redefinition, the, destroyer, is, generally, regarded, as, the, dominant, surface, combat, vessel, of, most, modern, blue, water, navies, however, the, once, distinct, roles, and, appearances, of, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and, corvettes, have, blurred, most, vessels, have, come, to, be, armed, with, a, mix, of, anti, surface, anti, submarine, and, anti, aircraft, weapons, class, designations, no, longer, reliably, indicate, a, displacement, hierarchy, and, the, size, of, all, vessel, types, has, grown, beyond, the, definitions, used, earlier, in, the, 20th, century, another, key, difference, between, older, and, modern, vessels, is, that, all, modern, warships, are, soft, without, the, thick, armor, and, bulging, anti, torpedo, protection, of, world, war, ii, and, older, designs, most, navies, also, include, many, types, of, support, and, auxiliary, vessels, such, as, minesweepers, patrol, boats, and, offshore, patrol, vessels, by, 1982, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, unclos, treaty, negotiations, had, produced, a, legal, definition, of, what, was, then, generally, accepted, as, a, late, twentieth, century, warship, the, unclos, definition, was, a, warship, means, a, ship, belonging, to, the, armed, forces, of, a, state, bearing, the, external, marks, distinguishing, such, ships, of, its, nationality, under, the, command, of, an, officer, duly, commissioned, by, the, government, of, the, state, and, whose, name, appears, in, the, appropriate, service, list, or, its, equivalent, and, manned, by, a, crew, which, is, under, regular, armed, forces, discipline, the, first, practical, submarines, were, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, but, it, was, only, after, the, development, of, the, torpedo, that, submarines, became, truly, dangerous, and, hence, useful, by, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, submarines, had, proved, their, potential, during, the, second, world, war, nazi, germany, s, fleet, of, u, boats, submarines, almost, starved, britain, into, submission, and, inflicted, huge, losses, on, us, coastal, shipping, the, success, of, submarines, led, to, the, development, of, new, anti, submarine, convoy, escorts, during, the, first, and, second, world, wars, such, as, the, destroyer, escort, confusingly, many, of, these, new, types, adopted, the, names, of, the, smaller, warships, from, the, age, of, sail, such, as, corvette, sloop, and, frigate, a, seaplane, tender, is, a, ship, that, supports, the, operation, of, seaplanes, some, of, these, vessels, known, as, seaplane, carriers, could, not, only, carry, seaplanes, but, also, provided, all, the, facilities, needed, for, their, operation, these, ships, are, regarded, by, some, as, the, first, aircraft, carriers, and, appeared, just, before, the, first, world, war, a, major, shift, in, naval, warfare, occurred, with, the, introduction, of, the, aircraft, carrier, first, at, taranto, and, then, at, pearl, harbor, the, aircraft, carrier, demonstrated, its, ability, to, strike, decisively, at, enemy, ships, out, of, sight, and, range, of, surface, vessels, by, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, the, carrier, had, become, the, dominant, warship, shinsh, maru, was, a, ship, of, the, imperial, japanese, army, during, world, war, ii, she, was, the, world, s, first, purpose, built, landing, craft, carrier, ship, and, a, pioneer, of, modern, day, amphibious, assault, ships, during, some, of, her, operations, she, was, known, to, have, used, at, least, four, cover, names, r1, gl, mt, and, ryujo, maru, an, amphibious, warfare, ship, is, an, amphibious, vehicle, warship, employed, to, land, and, support, ground, forces, such, as, marines, on, enemy, territory, during, an, amphibious, assault, specialized, shipping, can, be, divided, into, two, types, most, crudely, described, as, ships, and, craft, in, general, the, ships, carry, the, troops, from, the, port, of, embarkation, to, the, drop, point, for, the, assault, and, the, craft, carry, the, troops, from, the, ship, to, the, shore, amphibious, assaults, taking, place, over, short, distances, can, also, involve, the, shore, to, shore, technique, where, landing, craft, go, directly, from, the, port, of, embarkation, to, the, assault, point, amphibious, assault, ships, have, a, well, deck, with, landing, craft, which, can, carry, tanks, and, other, armoured, fighting, vehicles, and, also, have, a, deck, like, a, helicopter, carrier, for, helicopters, and, v, stol, aircraft
