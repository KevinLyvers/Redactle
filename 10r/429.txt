a, washing, machine, laundry, machine, clothes, washer, washer, or, simply, wash, is, a, machine, designed, to, launder, clothing, modern, day, home, appliances, use, electric, power, to, automatically, clean, clothes, the, term, is, mostly, applied, to, machines, that, use, water, as, opposed, to, dry, cleaning, which, uses, alternative, cleaning, fluids, and, is, performed, by, specialist, businesses, or, ultrasonic, cleaners, the, user, adds, laundry, detergent, which, is, sold, in, liquid, powder, or, dehydrated, sheet, form, to, the, wash, water, laundering, by, hand, involves, soaking, beating, scrubbing, and, rinsing, dirty, textiles, before, indoor, plumbing, it, was, necessary, to, carry, all, the, water, used, for, washing, boiling, and, rinsing, the, laundry, from, a, pump, well, or, spring, water, for, the, laundry, would, be, hand, carried, heated, on, a, fire, for, washing, then, poured, into, a, tub, this, meant, the, amount, of, warm, soapy, water, was, limited, it, would, be, reused, first, to, wash, the, least, soiled, clothing, then, to, wash, progressively, dirtier, laundry, removal, of, soap, and, water, from, the, clothing, after, washing, was, a, separate, process, first, soap, would, be, rinsed, out, with, clear, water, after, rinsing, the, soaking, wet, clothing, would, be, formed, into, a, roll, and, twisted, by, hand, to, extract, water, the, entire, process, often, occupied, an, entire, day, of, work, plus, drying, and, ironing, an, early, example, of, washing, by, machine, is, the, practice, of, fulling, in, a, fulling, mill, the, cloth, was, beaten, with, wooden, hammers, known, as, fulling, stocks, or, fulling, hammers, the, first, english, patent, under, the, category, of, washing, machines, was, issued, in, 1691, a, drawing, of, an, early, washing, machine, appeared, in, the, january, 1752, issue, of, the, gentleman, s, magazine, a, british, publication, jacob, christian, sch, ffer, s, washing, machine, design, was, published, in, 1767, in, germany, in, 1782, henry, sidgier, was, issued, a, british, patent, for, a, rotating, drum, washer, and, in, the, 1790s, edward, beetham, sold, numerous, patent, washing, mills, in, england, one, of, the, first, innovations, in, washing, machine, technology, was, the, use, of, enclosed, containers, or, basins, that, had, grooves, fingers, or, paddles, to, help, with, the, scrubbing, and, rubbing, of, the, clothes, the, person, using, the, washer, would, use, a, stick, to, press, and, rotate, the, clothes, along, the, textured, sides, of, the, basin, or, container, agitating, the, clothes, to, remove, dirt, and, mud, this, crude, agitator, technology, was, hand, powered, but, still, more, effective, than, actually, hand, washing, the, clothes, more, advancements, were, made, to, washing, machine, technology, in, the, form, of, the, rotating, drum, design, these, early, design, patents, consisted, of, a, drum, washer, that, was, hand, cranked, to, make, the, wooden, drums, rotate, while, the, technology, was, simple, enough, it, was, a, milestone, in, the, history, of, washing, machines, as, it, introduced, the, idea, of, powered, washing, drums, as, metal, drums, started, to, replace, the, traditional, wooden, drums, it, allowed, for, the, drum, to, turn, above, an, open, fire, or, an, enclosed, fire, chamber, raising, the, water, temperature, for, more, effective, washes, it, was, in, the, nineteenth, century, that, steam, power, was, first, used, in, washing, machine, designs, in, 1862, a, patented, compound, rotary, washing, machine, with, rollers, for, wringing, or, mangling, by, richard, lansdale, of, pendleton, manchester, was, shown, at, the, 1862, london, exhibition, the, first, united, states, patent, titled, clothes, washing, was, granted, to, nathaniel, briggs, of, new, hampshire, in, 1797, because, of, the, patent, office, fire, in, 1836, no, description, of, the, device, survives, the, invention, of, the, washing, machine, is, also, attributed, to, watervliet, shaker, village, as, a, patent, was, issued, to, an, amos, larcom, of, watervliet, new, york, in, 1829, but, it, is, not, certain, that, larcom, was, a, shaker, a, device, that, combined, a, washing, machine, with, a, wringer, mechanism, appeared, in, 1843, when, canadian, john, e, turnbull, of, saint, john, new, brunswick, patented, a, clothes, washer, with, wringer, rolls, during, the, 1850s, nicholas, bennett, of, the, mount, lebanon, shaker, society, at, new, lebanon, new, york, invented, a, wash, mill, but, in, 1858, he, assigned, the, patent, to, david, parker, of, the, canterbury, shaker, village, where, it, was, registered, as, the, improved, washing, machine, margaret, colvin, improved, the, triumph, rotary, washer, which, was, exhibited, in, the, women, s, pavilion, at, the, centennial, international, exhibition, of, 1876, in, philadelphia, at, the, same, exhibition, the, shakers, won, a, gold, medal, for, their, machine, electric, washing, machines, were, advertised, and, discussed, in, newspapers, as, early, as, 1904, alva, j, fisher, has, been, incorrectly, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, electric, washer, the, us, patent, office, shows, at, least, one, patent, issued, before, fisher, s, us, patent, number, 966677, e, g, woodrow, s, us, patent, number, 921195, the, first, inventor, of, the, electric, washing, machine, remains, unknown, us, electric, washing, machine, sales, reached, 913, 000, units, in, 1928, however, high, unemployment, rates, in, the, depression, years, reduced, sales, by, 1932, the, number, of, units, shipped, was, down, to, about, 600, 000, an, early, laundromat, in, the, united, states, opened, in, fort, worth, texas, in, 1934, it, was, run, by, andrew, klein, patrons, used, coin, in, the, slot, facilities, to, rent, washing, machines, the, term, laundromat, can, be, found, in, newspapers, as, early, as, 1884, and, they, were, widespread, during, the, depression, england, established, public, washrooms, for, laundry, along, with, bathhouses, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, washer, design, improved, during, the, 1930s, the, mechanism, was, now, enclosed, within, a, cabinet, and, more, attention, was, paid, to, electrical, and, mechanical, safety, spin, dryers, were, introduced, to, replace, the, dangerous, power, mangle, wringers, of, the, day, by, 1940, 60, of, the, 25, 000, 000, wired, homes, in, the, united, states, had, an, electric, washing, machine, many, of, these, machines, featured, a, power, wringer, although, built, in, spin, dryers, were, not, uncommon, bendix, home, appliances, a, subsidiary, of, avco, introduced, the, first, domestic, automatic, washing, machine, in, 1937, having, applied, for, a, patent, in, the, same, year, avco, had, licensed, the, name, from, bendix, corporation, an, otherwise, unrelated, company, in, appearance, and, mechanical, detail, this, first, machine, was, not, unlike, the, front, loading, automatic, washers, produced, today, although, it, included, many, of, today, s, basic, features, the, machine, lacked, any, drum, suspension, and, therefore, had, to, be, anchored, to, the, floor, to, prevent, walking, because, of, the, components, required, the, machine, was, also, expensive, for, instance, the, bendix, home, laundry, service, manual, published, november, 1, 1946, shows, that, the, drum, speed, change, was, facilitated, by, a, 2, speed, gearbox, built, to, a, heavy, duty, standard, not, unlike, a, car, automatic, gearbox, albeit, smaller, in, size, the, timer, was, also, probably, costly, because, miniature, electric, motors, were, expensive, to, produce, early, automatic, washing, machines, were, usually, connected, to, a, water, supply, via, temporary, slip, on, connectors, to, sink, taps, later, permanent, connections, to, hot, and, cold, water, became, the, norm, most, modern, front, loading, european, machines, now, only, have, a, cold, water, connection, called, cold, fill, and, rely, completely, on, internal, electric, heaters, to, raise, the, water, temperature, many, of, the, early, automatic, machines, had, coin, in, the, slot, facilities, and, were, installed, in, the, basement, laundry, rooms, of, apartment, houses, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, us, domestic, washer, production, was, suspended, for, the, duration, of, world, war, ii, in, favor, of, manufacturing, war, material, however, numerous, us, appliance, manufacturers, were, permitted, to, undertake, the, research, and, development, of, washers, during, the, war, years, many, took, the, opportunity, to, develop, automatic, machines, realizing, that, these, represented, the, future, of, the, industry, a, large, number, of, us, manufacturers, introduced, competing, automatic, machines, mainly, of, the, top, loading, type, in, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, general, electric, also, introduced, its, first, top, loading, automatic, model, in, 1947, this, machine, had, many, of, the, features, that, are, incorporated, into, modern, machines, another, early, form, of, automatic, washing, machine, manufactured, by, the, hoover, company, used, cartridges, to, program, different, wash, cycles, this, system, called, the, keymatic, used, plastic, cartridges, with, key, like, slots, and, ridges, around, the, edges, the, cartridge, was, inserted, into, a, slot, on, the, machine, and, a, mechanical, reader, operated, the, machine, accordingly, several, manufacturers, produced, semi, automatic, machines, requiring, the, user, to, intervene, at, one, or, two, points, in, the, wash, cycle, a, common, semi, automatic, type, available, from, hoover, in, the, uk, until, at, least, the, 1970s, included, two, tubs, one, with, an, agitator, or, impeller, for, washing, plus, another, smaller, tub, for, water, extraction, or, centrifugal, rinsing, these, machines, are, still, available, in, some, countries, such, as, india, since, their, introduction, automatic, washing, machines, have, relied, on, electromechanical, timers, to, sequence, the, washing, and, extraction, process, electromechanical, timers, consist, of, a, series, of, cams, on, a, common, shaft, driven, by, a, small, electric, motor, via, a, reduction, gearbox, at, the, appropriate, time, in, the, wash, cycle, each, cam, actuates, a, switch, to, engage, or, disengage, a, particular, part, of, the, machinery, for, example, the, drain, pump, motor, one, of, the, first, was, invented, in, 1957, by, winston, l, shelton, and, gresham, n, jennings, then, both, general, electric, engineers, the, device, was, granted, us, patent, 2870278, on, the, early, electromechanical, timers, the, motor, ran, at, a, constant, speed, throughout, the, wash, cycle, although, the, user, could, truncate, parts, of, the, program, by, manually, advancing, the, control, dial, however, by, the, 1950s, demand, for, greater, flexibility, in, the, wash, cycle, led, to, the, introduction, of, more, sophisticated, electrical, timers, to, supplement, the, electromechanical, timer, these, newer, timers, enabled, greater, variation, in, functions, such, as, the, wash, time, with, this, arrangement, the, electric, timer, motor, is, periodically, switched, off, to, permit, the, clothing, to, soak, and, is, only, re, energized, just, before, a, micro, switch, being, engaged, or, disengaged, for, the, next, stage, of, the, process, fully, electronic, timers, did, not, become, widespread, until, decades, later, despite, the, high, cost, of, automatic, washers, manufacturers, had, difficulty, meeting, the, demand, although, there, were, material, shortages, during, the, korean, war, by, 1953, automatic, washing, machine, sales, in, the, us, exceeded, those, of, wringer, type, electric, machines, in, the, uk, and, most, of, europe, electric, washing, machines, did, not, become, popular, until, the, 1950s, this, was, largely, because, of, the, economic, impact, of, world, war, ii, on, the, consumer, market, which, did, not, properly, recover, until, the, late, 1950s, the, early, electric, washers, were, single, tub, wringer, type, machines, as, fully, automatic, washing, machines, were, expensive, during, the, 1960s, twin, tub, machines, briefly, became, popular, helped, by, the, low, price, of, the, rolls, razor, washers, twin, tub, washing, machines, have, two, tubs, one, larger, than, the, other, the, smaller, tub, in, reality, is, a, spinning, drum, for, centrifugal, drying, while, the, larger, tub, only, has, an, agitator, in, its, bottom, some, machines, could, pump, used, wash, water, into, a, separate, tub, for, temporary, storage, and, to, later, pump, it, back, for, re, use, this, was, done, not, to, save, water, or, soap, but, because, heated, water, was, expensive, and, time, consuming, to, produce, automatic, washing, machines, did, not, become, dominant, in, the, uk, until, well, into, the, 1970s, and, by, then, were, almost, exclusively, of, the, front, loader, design, in, early, automatic, washing, machines, any, changes, in, impeller, drum, speed, were, achieved, by, mechanical, means, or, by, a, rheostat, on, the, motor, power, supply, however, since, the, 1970s, electronic, control, of, motor, speed, has, become, a, common, feature, on, the, more, expensive, models, over, time, manufacturers, of, automatic, washers, have, gone, to, great, lengths, to, reduce, costs, for, instance, expensive, gearboxes, are, no, longer, required, since, motor, speed, can, be, controlled, electronically, some, models, can, be, controlled, via, wifi, and, have, angled, tilted, drums, to, facilitate, loading, even, on, some, expensive, washers, the, outer, drum, of, front, loading, machines, is, often, but, not, always, made, of, plastic, it, can, also, be, made, out, of, metal, but, this, is, expensive, this, makes, changing, the, main, bearings, difficult, as, the, plastic, drum, usually, cannot, be, separated, into, two, halves, to, enable, the, inner, drum, to, be, removed, to, gain, access, to, the, bearing, many, residential, front, loading, washing, machines, typically, have, a, 25, kg, 55, lb, concrete, block, to, dampen, vibration, alternatives, include, a, plastic, counterweight, that, can, be, filled, with, water, after, delivery, reducing, or, controlling, motor, speeds, using, hydraulic, suspensions, instead, of, spring, suspensions, and, having, freely, moving, steel, balls, or, liquid, contained, inside, a, ring, mounted, on, both, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, drum, to, counter, the, weight, of, the, clothes, and, reduce, vibration, most, newer, front, load, machines, now, use, a, brushless, dc, bldc, motor, directly, connected, to, the, basket, direct, drive, where, the, stator, assembly, is, attached, to, the, rear, of, the, outer, plastic, drum, assembly, whilst, the, co, axial, rotor, is, mounted, on, the, shaft, of, the, inner, drum, the, direct, drive, motor, eliminates, the, need, for, a, pulley, belt, and, belt, tensioner, it, was, first, introduced, to, washing, machines, by, fisher, and, paykel, in, 1991, since, then, other, manufacturers, have, followed, suit, some, washing, machines, with, this, type, of, motor, now, come, with, 10, year, or, 20, year, warranties, the, motor, type, used, is, an, outrunner, due, to, its, slim, design, with, variable, speed, and, high, torque, the, rotor, is, connected, to, the, inner, tub, through, its, center, it, can, be, made, of, metal, or, plastic, some, direct, drive, washers, use, induction, motors, instead, of, bldc, motors, the, modern, washing, machine, market, has, seen, several, innovations, and, features, examples, including, in, the, early, 1990s, upmarket, machines, incorporated, microcontrollers, for, the, timing, process, these, proved, reliable, and, cost, effective, so, many, cheaper, machines, now, also, incorporate, microcontrollers, rather, than, electromechanical, timers, since, the, 2010s, some, machines, have, had, touchscreen, displays, full, color, or, color, displays, or, touch, sensitive, control, panels, in, 1994, staber, industries, released, the, system, 2000, washing, machine, which, is, the, only, top, loading, horizontal, axis, washer, to, be, manufactured, in, the, united, states, the, hexagonal, tub, spins, like, a, front, loading, machine, using, only, about, one, third, as, much, water, as, conventional, top, loaders, this, factor, has, led, to, an, energy, star, rating, for, its, high, efficiency, this, type, of, horizontal, axis, washer, and, dryer, with, a, circular, drum, is, often, used, in, europe, where, space, is, limited, as, they, can, be, as, thin, as, 41, cm, 16, in, in, width, in, 1998, new, zealand, based, company, fisher, paykel, introduced, its, smartdrive, washing, machine, line, in, the, us, this, washing, machine, uses, a, computer, controlled, system, to, determine, factors, such, as, load, size, and, adjusts, the, wash, cycle, to, match, it, also, used, a, mixed, system, of, washing, first, with, the, eco, active, wash, using, a, low, level, of, recirculated, water, being, sprayed, on, the, load, followed, by, a, more, traditional, style, wash, the, smartdrive, also, included, a, direct, drive, brushless, dc, electric, motor, which, simplified, the, bowl, and, agitator, drive, by, eliminating, the, gearbox, system, in, 2000, the, british, inventor, james, dyson, launched, the, cr01, contrarotator, a, type, of, washing, machine, with, two, cylinders, rotating, in, opposite, directions, it, was, claimed, that, this, design, reduced, the, wash, time, and, produced, cleaner, washing, than, a, single, cylinder, machine, in, 2004, the, launch, of, the, cr02, was, the, first, washing, machine, to, gain, the, british, allergy, foundation, seal, of, approval, however, neither, of, the, contrarotator, machines, is, now, in, production, as, they, were, expensive, to, manufacture, they, were, discontinued, in, 2005, it, is, patented, under, u, s, patent, us7750531b2, u, s, patent, us6311527, u, s, patent, us20010023513, u, s, patent, us6311527b1, u, s, patent, usd450164, in, 2001, whirlpool, corporation, introduced, the, calypso, the, first, vertical, axis, high, efficiency, washing, machine, to, be, top, loading, a, washplate, in, the, bottom, of, the, tub, nutated, a, special, wobbling, motion, to, bounce, shake, and, toss, the, laundry, simultaneously, water, containing, detergent, was, sprayed, onto, the, laundry, the, machine, proved, to, be, good, at, cleaning, but, gained, a, bad, reputation, due, to, frequent, breakdowns, and, destruction, of, laundry, the, washer, was, recalled, with, a, class, action, lawsuit, and, pulled, off, the, market, in, 2003, maytag, introduced, their, top, loading, neptune, tl, fav6800a, and, tl, fav9800a, washers, instead, of, an, agitator, the, machine, had, two, washplates, perpendicular, to, each, other, and, at, a, 45, degree, angle, from, the, bottom, of, the, tub, the, machine, would, fill, with, only, a, small, amount, of, water, and, the, two, wash, plates, would, spin, tumbling, the, load, within, it, mimicking, the, action, of, a, front, loading, washer, in, a, vertical, axis, design, in, 2006, sanyo, introduced, the, world, first, as, of, february, 2, 2006, with, regards, to, home, use, drum, type, washer, dryer, drum, type, washing, machine, with, air, wash, function, i, e, using, ozone, as, a, disinfectant, it, also, reused, and, disinfected, rinse, water, this, washing, machine, uses, only, 50, l, 11, 0, imp, gal, 13, 2, us, gal, of, water, in, the, recycle, mode, approximately, in, 2012, eco, indicators, were, introduced, capable, of, predicting, the, energy, demand, based, on, the, customer, settings, in, terms, of, program, and, temperature, features, available, in, most, modern, consumer, washing, machines, additionally, some, modern, machines, feature, around, 2015, and, 2017, some, manufacturers, namely, samsung, and, lg, electronics, offered, washers, and, dryers, that, either, have, a, top, loading, washer, and, dryer, built, on, top, of, a, front, loading, washer, and, dryer, respectively, in, samsung, washers, and, dryers, or, offer, users, an, optional, top, loading, washer, that, can, be, installed, under, a, washer, or, dryer, for, lg, washers, and, dryers, both, manufacturers, have, also, introduced, front, loading, washers, allowing, users, to, add, items, after, a, wash, cycle, has, started, and, samsung, has, also, introduced, top, loading, washers, with, a, built, in, sink, and, a, detergent, dispenser, that, claims, to, leave, no, residue, on, the, dispenser, itself, in, ifa, 2017, samsung, released, the, quickdrive, a, front, loading, washer, similar, to, the, dyson, contrarotator, but, instead, of, two, counter, rotating, drums, the, quickdrive, has, a, single, drum, with, a, counter, rotating, impeller, mounted, on, the, back, of, the, drum, samsung, claims, this, technique, reduces, cycle, times, by, half, and, energy, consumption, by, 20, the, us, has, introduced, standards, for, washing, machines, that, improve, their, energy, efficiency, and, reduce, their, water, consumption, the, top, loading, vertical, axis, washer, has, been, the, dominant, design, in, the, united, states, and, canada, this, design, places, the, clothes, in, a, vertically, mounted, perforated, basket, that, is, contained, within, a, water, retaining, tub, with, a, finned, water, pumping, agitator, in, the, center, of, the, bottom, of, the, basket, clothes, are, loaded, through, the, top, of, the, machine, which, is, usually, but, not, always, covered, with, a, hinged, door, the, drum, of, a, top, loading, washing, machine, can, include, a, lint, trap, during, the, wash, cycle, the, outer, tub, is, filled, with, water, sufficient, to, fully, immerse, and, suspend, the, clothing, freely, in, the, basket, the, movement, of, the, agitator, pushes, water, outward, between, the, paddles, towards, the, edge, of, the, tub, the, water, then, moves, outward, up, the, sides, of, the, basket, towards, the, center, and, then, down, towards, the, agitator, to, repeat, the, process, in, a, circulation, pattern, similar, to, the, shape, of, a, torus, the, agitator, direction, is, periodically, reversed, because, continuous, motion, in, one, direction, would, just, lead, to, the, water, spinning, around, the, basket, with, the, agitator, rather, than, the, water, being, pumped, in, the, torus, shaped, motion, some, washers, supplement, the, water, pumping, action, of, the, agitator, with, a, large, rotating, screw, on, the, shaft, above, the, agitator, to, help, move, water, downwards, in, the, center, of, the, basket, a, washing, machine, can, have, an, impeller, also, called, a, wash, plate, instead, of, an, agitator, which, serves, the, same, purpose, but, does, not, have, a, vertical, cylinder, extending, from, its, base, since, the, agitator, and, the, drum, are, separate, and, distinct, in, a, top, loading, washing, machine, the, mechanism, of, a, top, loader, is, inherently, more, complicated, than, a, front, loading, machine, manufacturers, have, devised, several, ways, to, control, the, motion, of, the, agitator, during, the, wash, and, rinse, separately, from, the, high, speed, rotation, of, the, drum, required, for, the, spin, cycle, while, a, top, loading, washing, machine, could, use, a, universal, motor, or, dc, brushless, motor, it, is, conventional, for, top, loading, washing, machines, to, use, more, expensive, heavy, and, potentially, more, electrically, efficient, and, reliable, induction, motors, an, alternative, to, this, oscillating, agitator, design, is, the, impeller, type, washtub, pioneered, by, hoover, on, its, long, running, hoovermatic, series, of, top, loading, machines, here, an, impeller, trademarked, by, hoover, as, a, pulsator, mounted, on, the, side, of, the, tub, spins, in, a, constant, direction, and, creates, a, fast, moving, current, of, water, in, the, tub, which, drags, the, clothes, through, the, water, along, a, toroidal, path, this, design, was, used, in, the, hoover, 0307, washer, the, impeller, design, has, the, advantage, of, mechanical, simplicity, a, single, speed, motor, with, belt, drive, is, all, that, is, required, to, drive, the, pulsator, with, no, need, for, gearboxes, or, complex, electrical, controls, but, has, the, disadvantage, of, lower, load, capacity, in, relation, to, tub, size, hoovermatic, machines, were, made, mostly, in, twin, tub, format, for, the, european, market, where, they, competed, with, hotpoint, s, supermatic, line, which, used, the, oscillating, agitator, design, until, the, early, 1990s, some, industrial, garment, testing, machines, still, use, the, hoover, wash, action, another, alternative, involves, pulsating, the, agitator, in, other, words, having, an, agitator, with, a, reciprocating, motion, along, its, vertical, axis, some, washing, machines, have, agitators, that, move, in, an, orbiting, motion, or, agitators, that, nutate, at, the, bottom, special, top, loading, washing, machines, designed, for, washing, sneakers, can, incorporate, bristles, in, their, agitators, alternatively, the, inner, tub, itself, can, nutate, inside, the, outer, tub, the, many, different, ways, manufacturers, have, solved, the, same, problem, over, the, years, is, a, good, example, of, many, different, ways, to, solve, the, same, engineering, problem, with, different, goals, different, manufacturing, capabilities, and, expertise, and, different, patent, encumbrances, in, many, current, top, loading, washers, if, the, motor, spins, in, one, direction, the, gearbox, drives, the, agitator, if, the, motor, spins, the, other, way, the, gearbox, locks, the, agitator, and, spins, the, basket, and, agitator, together, similarly, if, the, pump, motor, rotates, one, way, it, recirculates, the, sudsy, water, in, the, other, direction, it, pumps, water, from, the, machine, during, the, spin, cycle, mechanically, this, system, is, very, simple, in, some, top, loaders, the, motor, runs, only, in, one, direction, during, agitation, the, transmission, converts, the, rotation, into, the, alternating, motion, driving, the, agitator, during, the, spin, cycle, the, timer, turns, on, a, solenoid, which, engages, a, clutch, locking, the, motor, s, rotation, to, the, wash, basket, providing, a, spin, cycle, general, electric, s, very, popular, line, of, filter, flo, seen, to, the, right, used, a, variant, of, this, design, where, the, motor, reversed, only, to, pump, water, out, of, the, machine, the, same, clutch, which, allows, the, heavy, tub, full, of, wet, clothes, to, slip, as, it, comes, up, to, the, motor, s, speed, is, also, allowed, to, slip, during, agitation, to, engage, a, gentle, cycle, for, delicate, clothes, whirlpool, kenmore, created, a, popular, design, demonstrating, the, complex, mechanisms, which, could, be, used, to, produce, different, motions, from, a, single, motor, with, the, so, called, wig, wag, mechanism, which, was, used, for, decades, until, modern, controls, rendered, it, obsolete, in, the, whirlpool, mechanism, a, protruding, moving, piece, oscillates, in, time, with, the, agitation, motion, two, solenoids, are, mounted, to, this, protruding, moving, piece, with, wires, attaching, them, to, the, timer, during, the, cycle, the, motor, operates, continuously, and, the, solenoids, on, the, wig, wag, engage, in, agitation, or, spin, despite, the, wires, controlling, the, solenoids, being, subject, to, abrasion, and, broken, connections, due, to, their, constant, motion, and, the, solenoids, operating, in, a, damp, environment, where, corrosion, could, damage, them, these, machines, were, surprisingly, reliable, some, top, loaders, especially, compact, apartment, sized, washers, use, a, hybrid, mechanism, the, motor, reverses, direction, every, few, seconds, often, with, a, pause, between, direction, changes, to, perform, the, agitation, the, spin, cycle, is, accomplished, by, engaging, a, clutch, in, the, transmission, a, separate, motorized, pump, is, generally, used, to, drain, this, style, of, machine, these, machines, could, easily, be, implemented, with, universal, motors, or, more, modern, dc, brushless, motors, but, older, ones, tend, to, use, a, capacitor, start, induction, motor, with, a, pause, between, reversals, of, agitation, the, front, loading, or, horizontal, axis, clothes, washer, is, the, dominant, design, in, europe, and, in, most, parts, of, the, world, in, the, united, states, and, canada, most, high, end, washing, machines, are, of, this, type, in, addition, most, commercial, and, industrial, clothes, washers, around, the, world, are, of, the, horizontal, axis, design, this, layout, mounts, the, inner, drum, and, outer, drum, horizontally, and, loading, is, through, a, door, at, the, front, of, the, machine, the, door, often, but, not, always, contains, a, transparent, window, agitation, is, supplied, by, the, back, and, forth, rotation, of, the, cylinder, and, by, gravity, the, clothes, are, lifted, by, paddles, on, the, inside, wall, of, the, drum, and, then, dropped, this, motion, flexes, the, weave, of, the, fabric, and, forces, water, and, detergent, solution, through, the, clothes, load, because, the, wash, action, does, not, require, the, clothing, to, be, freely, suspended, in, water, only, enough, water, is, needed, to, moisten, the, fabric, because, less, water, is, required, front, loaders, typically, use, less, soap, and, the, repeated, dropping, and, folding, action, of, the, tumbling, can, easily, produce, large, amounts, of, foam, or, suds, front, loaders, control, water, usage, through, the, surface, tension, of, water, and, the, capillary, wicking, action, this, creates, in, the, fabric, weave, a, front, loader, washer, always, fills, to, the, same, low, water, level, but, a, large, pile, of, dry, clothing, standing, in, water, will, soak, up, the, moisture, causing, the, water, level, to, drop, the, washer, then, refills, to, maintain, the, original, water, level, because, it, takes, time, for, this, water, absorption, to, occur, with, a, motionless, pile, of, fabric, nearly, all, front, loaders, begin, the, washing, process, by, slowly, tumbling, the, clothing, under, the, stream, of, water, entering, and, filling, the, drum, to, rapidly, saturate, the, clothes, with, water, compared, to, top, loading, washers, clothing, can, be, packed, more, tightly, in, a, front, loader, up, to, the, full, drum, volume, if, using, a, cotton, wash, cycle, this, is, because, wet, cloth, usually, fits, into, a, smaller, space, than, dry, cloth, and, front, loaders, can, self, regulate, the, water, needed, to, achieve, correct, washing, and, rinsing, however, extreme, overloading, of, front, loading, washers, pushes, fabrics, towards, the, small, gap, between, the, loading, door, and, the, front, of, the, wash, basket, potentially, resulting, in, fabrics, lost, between, the, basket, and, outer, tub, and, in, severe, cases, tearing, of, clothing, and, jamming, the, motion, of, the, basket, front, loading, washers, are, mechanically, simple, compared, to, top, loaders, with, the, main, motor, a, universal, motor, or, variable, frequency, drive, motor, normally, being, connected, to, the, drum, via, a, grooved, pulley, belt, and, large, pulley, wheel, without, the, need, for, a, gearbox, clutch, or, crank, the, action, of, a, front, loading, washing, machine, is, better, suited, to, a, motor, capable, of, reversing, direction, with, every, reversal, of, the, wash, drum, a, universal, motor, is, noisier, less, efficient, and, does, not, last, as, long, but, is, better, suited, to, the, task, of, reversing, direction, every, few, seconds, some, models, such, as, those, by, lg, use, a, motor, directly, connected, to, the, drum, eliminating, the, need, for, a, belt, and, pulley, however, front, load, washers, suffer, from, their, own, technical, challenges, due, to, the, horizontal, disposition, of, the, drum, a, top, loading, washer, keeps, water, inside, the, tub, merely, through, the, force, of, gravity, pulling, down, on, the, water, while, a, front, loader, must, tightly, seal, the, door, with, a, gasket, to, prevent, water, dripping, onto, the, floor, during, the, wash, cycle, this, access, door, is, locked, shut, with, an, interlocking, device, during, the, entire, wash, cycle, since, opening, the, door, with, the, machine, in, use, could, result, in, water, gushing, onto, the, floor, if, this, interlock, is, broken, for, any, reason, such, a, machine, stops, operation, even, if, this, failure, happens, mid, cycle, in, most, machines, the, interlock, is, usually, doubly, redundant, to, prevent, either, opening, with, the, drum, full, of, water, or, being, opened, during, the, spin, cycle, for, front, loaders, without, viewing, windows, on, the, door, it, is, possible, to, accidentally, pinch, the, fabric, between, the, door, and, the, drum, resulting, in, tearing, and, damage, to, the, pinched, clothing, during, tumbling, and, spinning, nearly, all, front, loader, washers, for, the, consumer, market, also, use, a, folded, flexible, bellows, assembly, around, the, door, opening, to, keep, clothing, contained, inside, the, drum, during, the, tumbling, wash, cycle, if, this, bellows, assembly, were, not, used, small, articles, of, clothing, such, as, socks, could, slip, out, of, the, wash, drum, near, the, door, and, fall, down, the, narrow, slot, between, the, outer, and, inner, drums, plugging, the, drain, and, possibly, jamming, rotation, of, the, inner, drum, retrieving, lost, items, from, between, the, outer, drum, and, inner, drum, can, require, complete, disassembly, of, the, front, of, the, washer, and, pulling, out, the, entire, inner, wash, drum, commercial, and, industrial, front, loaders, used, by, businesses, described, below, usually, do, not, use, the, bellows, but, instead, require, all, small, objects, to, be, placed, in, a, mesh, bag, to, prevent, loss, near, the, drum, opening, there, are, many, variations, of, the, two, general, designs, top, loading, machines, in, asia, use, impellers, instead, of, agitators, impellers, are, similar, to, agitators, except, that, they, do, not, have, the, center, post, extending, up, in, the, middle, of, the, washtub, basket, some, machines, which, load, from, the, top, are, otherwise, much, more, similar, to, front, loading, horizontal, axis, drum, machines, they, have, a, drum, rotating, around, a, horizontal, axis, as, a, front, loader, but, there, is, no, front, door, instead, there, is, a, liftable, lid, that, provides, access, to, the, drum, which, has, a, hatch, that, can, be, latched, shut, clothes, are, loaded, the, hatch, and, lid, are, closed, and, the, machine, operates, and, spins, just, like, a, front, loader, these, machines, are, narrower, but, usually, taller, than, front, loaders, usually, have, a, lower, capacity, and, are, intended, for, use, where, only, a, narrow, space, is, available, as, is, sometimes, the, case, in, europe, they, have, incidental, advantages, they, can, be, loaded, while, standing, but, force, the, user, to, bend, down, instead, of, crouching, down, or, sitting, to, unload, they, do, not, require, a, perishable, rubber, bellows, seal, and, instead, of, the, drum, having, a, single, bearing, on, one, side, it, has, a, pair, of, symmetrical, bearings, one, on, each, side, avoiding, asymmetrical, bearing, loading, and, potentially, increasing, life, there, are, also, combo, washer, dryer, machines, that, combine, washing, cycles, and, a, full, drying, cycle, in, the, same, drum, eliminating, the, need, to, transfer, wet, clothes, from, a, washer, to, a, dryer, machine, in, principle, these, machines, are, convenient, for, overnight, cleaning, the, combined, cycle, is, considerably, longer, but, the, effective, capacity, for, cleaning, larger, batches, of, laundry, is, drastically, reduced, the, drying, process, tends, to, use, much, more, energy, than, using, two, separate, devices, because, a, combo, washer, dryer, not, only, must, dry, the, clothing, but, also, needs, to, dry, out, the, wash, chamber, itself, these, machines, are, used, more, where, space, is, at, a, premium, such, as, areas, of, europe, and, japan, because, they, can, be, fit, into, small, spaces, perform, both, washing, and, drying, and, many, can, be, operated, without, dedicated, utility, connections, in, these, machines, the, washer, and, dryer, functions, often, have, different, capacities, with, the, dryer, usually, having, the, lowest, capacity, these, combo, machines, should, not, be, confused, with, a, dryer, on, top, of, a, washer, installation, or, with, a, laundry, center, which, is, a, one, piece, appliance, offering, a, compromise, between, a, washer, dryer, combo, and, a, full, washer, to, the, side, of, the, dryer, installation, or, a, dryer, on, top, of, a, washer, installation, laundry, centers, usually, have, the, dryer, on, top, of, the, washer, with, the, controls, for, both, machines, being, on, a, single, control, panel, often, the, controls, are, simpler, than, the, controls, on, a, washer, dryer, combo, or, a, dedicated, washer, and, dryer, some, implementations, are, patented, under, us, patent, us6343492b1, and, us, patent, us, 6363756b1, true, front, loading, machines, top, loading, machines, with, horizontal, axis, drums, and, true, top, loading, vertical, axis, machines, can, be, compared, on, several, aspects, the, earliest, washing, machines, simply, carried, out, a, washing, action, when, loaded, with, clothes, and, soap, filled, with, hot, water, and, started, over, time, machines, became, more, and, more, automated, first, with, complex, electromechanical, controllers, then, fully, electronic, controllers, users, put, clothes, into, the, machine, select, a, suitable, program, via, a, switch, start, the, machine, and, come, back, to, remove, clean, and, slightly, damp, clothes, at, the, end, of, the, cycle, the, controller, starts, and, stops, many, different, processes, including, pumps, and, valves, to, fill, and, empty, the, drum, with, water, heating, and, rotating, at, different, speeds, with, different, combinations, of, settings, for, different, fabrics, longer, wash, cycles, can, allow, greater, water, and, energy, efficiency, with, less, water, to, heat, up, for, a, 3, 5, kg, 7, 7, lb, load, from, 2011, to, 2021, the, average, australian, washing, machine, cycle, including, rinsing, and, spinning, has, lengthened, from, 99, to, 144, minutes, for, front, loaders, and, 55, to, 59, minutes, for, top, loaders, many, front, loading, machines, have, internal, electrical, heating, elements, to, heat, the, wash, water, to, near, boiling, if, desired, the, rate, of, the, chemical, cleaning, action, of, the, detergent, and, other, laundry, chemicals, increases, greatly, with, temperature, by, the, arrhenius, equation, washing, machines, with, internal, heaters, can, use, special, detergents, formulated, to, release, different, chemical, ingredients, at, different, temperatures, allowing, different, types, of, stains, and, soils, to, be, cleaned, from, the, clothes, as, the, wash, water, is, heated, by, the, electrical, heater, however, higher, temperature, washing, uses, more, energy, and, many, fabrics, and, elastics, are, damaged, at, higher, temperatures, temperatures, exceeding, 40, c, 104, f, have, the, undesirable, effect, of, deactivating, the, enzymes, when, using, biological, detergent, many, machines, are, cold, fill, connected, to, cold, water, only, which, they, internally, heat, to, operating, temperature, where, water, can, be, heated, more, cheaply, or, with, less, carbon, dioxide, emission, than, by, electricity, a, cold, fill, operation, is, inefficient, front, loaders, need, to, use, low, sudsing, detergents, because, the, tumbling, action, of, the, drum, entrains, air, into, the, clothes, load, which, can, cause, excessive, foamy, suds, and, overflows, however, due, to, the, efficient, use, of, water, and, detergent, the, suds, issue, with, front, loaders, can, be, controlled, by, simply, using, less, detergent, without, lessening, the, cleaning, action, washing, machines, perform, several, rinses, after, the, main, wash, to, remove, most, of, the, detergent, modern, washing, machines, use, less, hot, water, due, to, environmental, concerns, however, this, has, led, to, the, problem, of, poor, rinsing, on, many, washing, machines, on, the, market, which, can, be, a, problem, to, people, who, are, sensitive, to, detergents, the, allergy, uk, website, suggests, re, running, the, rinse, cycle, or, rerunning, the, entire, wash, cycle, without, detergent, in, response, to, complaints, many, washing, machines, allow, the, user, to, select, additional, rinse, cycles, at, the, expense, of, higher, water, usage, and, longer, cycle, time, bosch, for, example, in, its, allergy, wash, program, incorporates, an, additional, three, minute, rinse, cycle, with, water, of, at, least, 60, c, 140, f, to, rinse, off, detergent, residues, and, any, allergens, front, loading, machines, spin, in, multiple, stages, of, their, cycle, after, main, wash, after, individual, rinses, and, the, final, high, speed, spin, some, of, those, spins, may, be, absent, depending, on, the, particular, cycle, higher, spin, speeds, along, with, larger, tub, diameters, remove, more, water, leading, to, faster, drying, on, the, other, hand, the, need, for, ironing, can, be, reduced, by, not, using, the, spin, cycle, in, the, washing, machine, if, a, heated, clothes, dryer, is, used, after, the, wash, and, spin, energy, use, is, reduced, if, more, water, has, been, removed, from, clothes, however, faster, spinning, can, crease, clothes, more, also, mechanical, wear, on, bearings, increases, rapidly, with, rotational, speed, reducing, life, early, machines, would, spin, at, 300, rpm, and, because, of, lack, of, any, mechanical, suspension, would, often, shake, and, vibrate, in, 1976, most, front, loading, washing, machines, spun, at, around, 700, rpm, or, less, today, most, machines, spin, at, 1000, 1600, rpm, most, machines, have, variable, speeds, ranging, 300, 2000, rpm, depending, on, the, machine, separate, spin, driers, without, washing, functionality, are, available, for, specialized, applications, for, example, a, small, high, speed, centrifuge, machine, may, be, provided, in, locker, rooms, of, communal, swimming, pools, to, allow, wet, swimsuits, to, be, substantially, dried, to, a, slightly, damp, condition, after, daily, use, washing, machines, often, incorporate, balance, rings, filled, with, a, liquid, such, as, a, calcium, chloride, salt, water, solution, that, are, designed, to, balance, the, inner, drum, of, the, washer, during, spin, cycles, the, balance, ring, may, be, filled, with, oil, and, contain, balls, on, races, somewhat, similarly, to, a, ball, bearing, to, achieve, the, same, effect, the, bendix, economat, used, a, flexible, rubber, inner, tub, that, would, squeeze, the, clothes, towards, the, agitator, located, in, the, center, of, the, inner, tub, in, order, to, remove, water, from, the, clothes, instead, of, spinning, the, inner, tub, this, was, performed, by, exerting, a, vacuum, on, the, inner, tub, many, home, washing, machines, use, a, plastic, rather, than, metal, outer, shell, to, contain, the, wash, water, residue, can, build, up, on, the, plastic, tub, over, time, some, manufacturers, advise, users, to, perform, a, regular, maintenance, or, freshening, wash, to, clean, the, inside, of, the, washing, machine, of, any, mold, bacteria, encrusted, detergent, and, unspecified, dirt, more, effectively, than, with, a, normal, wash, a, maintenance, wash, is, performed, without, any, laundry, on, the, hottest, wash, program, adding, substances, such, as, white, vinegar, 100, grams, of, citric, acid, a, detergent, with, bleaching, properties, or, a, proprietary, washing, machine, cleaner, the, first, injection, of, water, goes, into, the, sump, so, the, machine, can, be, allowed, to, fill, for, about, 30, seconds, before, adding, cleaning, substances, flexible, rubber, hoses, are, typically, used, to, connect, from, a, building, water, supply, to, a, washing, machine, these, hoses, are, often, exposed, to, full, water, pressure, on, a, continuing, basis, and, can, deteriorate, over, time, developing, bulges, or, weak, spots, that, eventually, cause, leaks, or, catastrophic, bursting, and, flooding, since, the, hoses, are, often, hidden, from, view, they, may, be, difficult, to, inspect, and, easily, forgotten, until, a, problem, occurs, if, a, hose, burst, occurs, when, nobody, is, present, to, notice, the, problem, a, huge, volume, of, water, can, be, delivered, over, a, short, time, causing, extensive, interior, flooding, damage, or, even, structural, damage, it, has, been, estimated, that, a, burst, supply, hose, can, deliver, two, tons, of, water, in, an, hour, to, reduce, these, risks, it, is, a, common, recommendation, to, use, flexible, hoses, which, have, been, jacketed, with, a, braided, stainless, steel, mesh, this, jacketing, cannot, prevent, leaks, from, developing, but, it, can, slow, the, development, of, large, bulges, or, aneurysms, which, can, burst, suddenly, without, warning, however, even, braided, metal, jackets, often, cannot, withstand, the, enormous, pressures, generated, by, water, freezing, within, an, enclosed, volume, an, additional, precaution, is, to, install, a, washing, machine, inside, a, shallow, metal, or, plastic, pan, which, can, collect, minor, leakage, and, divert, the, water, to, a, nearby, drain, or, to, the, outside, of, a, building, drain, pans, can, also, divert, water, released, by, other, problems, such, as, a, jammed, solenoid, valve, in, a, washing, machine, a, serious, limitation, of, drain, pans, is, that, they, typically, cannot, handle, the, large, volumes, of, pressurized, water, released, by, a, burst, supply, hose, so, a, drain, pan, is, no, substitute, for, hose, burst, precautions, in, the, absence, of, a, drain, a, pan, may, still, be, useful, to, confine, leakage, temporarily, while, a, local, or, remote, water, alarm, is, triggered, in, addition, or, instead, of, an, alarm, a, water, detector, may, signal, the, main, water, shutoff, valve, to, the, building, to, be, automatically, closed, to, prevent, flooding, a, very, effective, precaution, is, to, install, a, shutoff, or, isolation, valve, which, stops, any, water, from, being, supplied, except, when, a, washing, machine, is, actually, operating, the, simplest, method, is, to, manually, open, and, close, the, hot, and, cold, water, shutoff, valves, traditionally, globe, valves, behind, the, washing, machine, each, time, it, is, used, this, method, relies, on, the, washing, machine, user, conscientiously, operating, the, two, valves, each, time, laundry, is, done, in, spite, of, the, awkward, location, of, the, valves, and, the, tedious, process, of, turning, the, handles, through, multiple, rotations, an, improvement, over, the, traditional, setup, is, to, install, a, specialized, laundry, shutoff, valve, typically, it, consists, of, two, ball, valves, connected, to, a, single, handle, so, they, can, be, operated, by, a, horizontal, or, vertical, lever, moved, by, 90, degrees, this, makes, the, operation, of, the, valves, a, quick, procedure, but, the, washing, machine, user, must, still, remember, to, turn, off, the, water, even, though, the, failure, to, do, this, produces, no, immediately, obvious, problems, to, close, this, risk, exposure, some, shutoff, valves, have, a, spring, energized, mechanical, timer, which, is, started, when, the, user, pushes, a, lever, to, open, the, valves, after, a, preset, time, of, several, hours, elapses, the, spring, powered, mechanism, automatically, closes, the, valve, without, further, user, intervention, a, variant, of, this, setup, requires, the, user, to, press, a, button, to, open, the, valves, for, an, electrically, timed, interval, other, automatic, valve, operating, mechanisms, electronically, detect, when, a, washing, machine, draws, electrical, power, as, it, starts, and, then, open, the, water, supply, valves, typically, the, power, plug, for, the, washing, machine, is, connected, to, a, special, detector, receptacle, or, cable, to, allowing, monitoring, of, the, power, draw, although, pressurized, water, supply, leaks, can, cause, the, most, damage, in, the, least, amount, of, time, water, drainage, can, also, cause, problems, if, not, handled, properly, washing, machine, drainage, hoses, should, be, secured, properly, to, prevent, accidental, dislodgement, and, drains, should, be, inspected, and, cleared, periodically, to, prevent, buildup, of, laundry, lint, mold, and, other, deposits, capacity, and, cost, are, both, considerations, when, purchasing, a, washing, machine, all, else, being, equal, a, machine, of, higher, capacity, will, cost, more, to, buy, but, will, be, more, convenient, if, large, amounts, of, laundry, must, be, cleaned, fewer, runs, of, a, machine, of, larger, capacity, may, have, lower, running, costs, and, better, energy, and, water, efficiency, than, frequent, use, of, a, smaller, machine, particularly, for, large, families, however, running, a, large, machine, with, small, loads, is, typically, inefficient, and, wasteful, unless, the, machine, has, been, designed, to, handle, such, situations, for, many, years, energy, and, water, efficiency, were, not, regulated, and, little, attention, was, paid, to, them, from, the, last, part, of, the, 20th, century, increasing, attention, was, paid, to, efficiency, with, regulations, enforcing, some, standards, efficiency, became, a, selling, point, both, to, save, on, running, costs, and, to, reduce, carbon, dioxide, emissions, associated, with, energy, generation, and, waste, of, water, as, energy, and, water, efficiency, became, regulated, they, became, a, selling, point, for, buyers, however, the, effectiveness, of, rinsing, was, not, specified, and, it, did, not, directly, attract, the, attention, of, buyers, therefore, manufacturers, tended, to, reduce, the, degree, of, rinsing, after, washing, saving, water, and, electrical, energy, this, had, the, side, effect, of, leaving, more, detergent, residue, in, clothes, which, can, affect, people, with, allergies, or, sensitivity, in, response, to, complaints, some, manufacturers, have, now, designed, their, machines, with, a, user, selectable, option, for, additional, rinsing, washing, machines, display, an, eu, energy, label, with, grades, for, energy, efficiency, washing, performance, and, spin, efficiency, grades, for, energy, efficiency, run, from, a, to, d, best, to, worst, providing, a, simple, method, for, judging, running, costs, washing, performance, and, spin, efficiency, are, graded, in, the, range, a, to, g, however, all, machines, for, sale, must, have, washing, performance, a, so, that, manufacturers, cannot, compromise, washing, performance, in, order, to, improve, the, energy, efficiency, this, labeling, has, had, the, desired, effect, of, driving, customers, toward, more, efficient, washing, machines, and, away, from, less, efficient, ones, according, to, regulations, each, washing, machine, is, equipped, with, a, wastewater, filter, this, ensures, that, no, hazardous, chemical, substances, are, disposed, of, improperly, through, the, sewage, system, on, the, other, hand, it, also, ensures, that, if, there, is, backflow, in, the, plumbing, system, sewage, cannot, enter, the, washing, machine, top, loading, and, front, loading, clothes, washers, are, covered, by, a, single, national, standard, regulating, energy, consumption, the, old, federal, standards, applicable, before, january, 2011, did, not, restrict, water, consumption, there, was, no, limit, on, how, much, unheated, rinse, water, could, be, used, energy, consumption, for, clothes, washers, is, quantified, using, the, energy, factor, after, new, mandatory, federal, standards, were, introduced, many, us, washers, were, manufactured, to, be, more, energy, and, water, efficient, than, required, by, the, federal, standard, or, even, than, required, by, the, more, stringent, energy, star, standard, manufacturers, were, further, motivated, to, exceed, mandatory, standards, by, a, program, of, direct, to, manufacturer, tax, credits, in, north, america, the, energy, star, program, compares, and, lists, energy, efficient, clothes, washers, certified, energy, star, units, can, be, compared, by, their, modified, energy, factor, mef, and, water, factor, wf, coefficients, the, mef, figure, of, merit, states, how, many, cubic, feet, about, 28, 3, liters, of, clothes, are, washed, per, kwh, kilowatt, hour, the, coefficient, is, influenced, by, factors, including, the, configuration, of, the, washer, top, loading, front, loading, its, spin, speed, and, the, temperatures, and, the, amount, of, water, used, in, the, rinse, and, wash, cycles, energy, star, residential, clothes, washers, must, have, an, mef, of, at, least, 2, 0, the, higher, the, better, the, best, machines, may, reach, 3, 5, energy, star, washers, must, also, have, a, wf, of, less, than, 6, 0, the, lower, the, better, a, commercial, washing, machine, is, intended, for, more, intensive, use, than, a, consumer, washing, machine, durability, and, functionality, is, more, important, than, style, most, commercial, washers, are, bulky, and, heavy, often, with, more, expensive, stainless, steel, construction, to, minimize, corrosion, in, a, constantly, moist, environment, they, are, built, with, large, easy, to, open, service, covers, and, washers, are, designed, not, to, require, access, from, the, underside, for, service, commercial, washers, are, often, installed, in, long, rows, with, a, wide, access, passageway, behind, all, the, machines, to, allow, maintenance, without, moving, the, heavy, machinery, many, commercial, washers, are, built, for, use, by, the, general, public, and, are, installed, in, publicly, accessible, laundromats, or, laundrettes, originally, they, were, operated, by, coins, similar, to, older, vending, machines, but, today, they, are, activated, by, money, accepting, devices, or, card, readers, the, features, of, a, commercial, laundromat, washer, are, usually, more, limited, than, those, of, a, consumer, washer, usually, offering, just, two, or, three, basic, wash, programs, and, an, option, to, choose, wash, cycle, temperatures, some, more, advanced, models, allow, extra, cost, options, such, as, an, additional, wash, or, rinse, cycle, at, the, choice, of, the, user, the, typical, front, loading, commercial, washing, machine, also, differs, from, consumer, models, in, its, discharge, of, spent, wash, and, rinse, water, while, the, consumer, models, pump, used, washer, water, out, allowing, the, waste, drainage, pipe, to, be, located, above, the, floor, level, front, loading, commercial, machines, generally, use, only, gravity, to, expel, used, water, a, drain, valve, at, the, bottom, rear, of, the, machine, opens, at, the, appointed, time, during, the, cycle, allowing, water, to, flow, out, this, requires, a, special, drainage, trough, equipped, with, a, filter, and, drain, and, routed, behind, each, machine, the, trough, is, usually, part, of, a, cement, platform, built, for, the, purpose, of, raising, the, machines, to, a, convenient, height, and, can, be, seen, behind, washers, at, most, laundromats, most, laundromat, machines, are, horizontal, axis, front, loading, models, because, of, their, lower, operating, costs, notably, lower, consumption, of, expensive, hot, water, by, contrast, commercial, washers, for, internal, business, operations, which, are, often, referred, to, as, washer, extractor, machines, may, include, features, absent, from, domestic, machines, many, commercial, washers, offer, an, option, for, automatic, injection, of, five, or, more, different, chemical, types, so, that, the, operator, does, not, have, to, deal, with, constantly, measuring, out, soap, products, and, fabric, softeners, for, each, load, by, hand, instead, a, precise, metering, system, draws, the, detergents, and, wash, additives, directly, from, large, liquid, chemical, storage, barrels, and, injects, them, as, needed, into, the, various, wash, and, rinse, cycles, some, computer, controlled, commercial, washers, offer, the, operator, detailed, control, over, the, various, wash, and, rinse, cycles, allowing, the, operator, to, program, custom, washing, cycles, most, large, scale, industrial, washers, are, horizontal, axis, machines, but, they, may, have, front, side, or, top, load, doors, some, industrial, clothes, washers, can, batch, process, up, to, 800, pounds, 360, kg, of, textiles, at, once, and, can, be, used, for, extremely, machine, abusive, washing, tasks, such, as, stone, washing, or, fabric, bleaching, and, dyeing, an, industrial, washer, can, be, mounted, on, heavy, duty, shock, absorbers, and, attached, to, a, concrete, floor, so, that, it, can, extract, water, from, even, the, most, severely, out, of, balance, and, heavy, wash, loads, noise, and, vibration, are, not, as, unacceptable, as, in, a, domestic, machine, the, machine, may, be, mounted, on, hydraulic, cylinders, permitting, the, entire, washer, to, be, lifted, and, tilted, so, that, fabrics, can, be, automatically, dumped, from, the, wash, drum, onto, a, conveyor, belt, once, the, cycle, is, complete, one, special, type, of, continuous, processing, washer, is, known, as, the, tunnel, washer, this, specialized, high, capacity, machine, does, not, have, a, drum, where, everything, being, washed, undergoes, distinct, wash, and, rinse, cycles, instead, the, laundry, progresses, slowly, and, continuously, through, a, long, large, diameter, horizontal, axis, rotating, tube, in, the, manner, of, an, assembly, line, with, different, processes, at, different, positions, the, historically, laborious, process, of, washing, clothes, a, task, which, often, consumed, a, whole, day, was, at, times, described, as, women, s, work, the, spread, of, the, washing, machine, has, been, seen, to, be, a, force, behind, the, improvement, of, women, s, position, in, society, before, the, advent, of, the, washing, machine, laundry, was, done, first, at, watercourses, and, later, in, public, wash, houses, known, as, lavoirs, camille, paglia, and, others, argue, that, the, washing, machine, led, to, a, type, of, social, isolation, of, women, as, a, previously, communal, activity, became, a, solitary, one, in, 2009, the, italian, newspaper, l, osservatore, romano, reprinted, a, playboy, magazine, article, on, international, women, s, day, arguing, that, the, washing, machine, had, done, more, for, the, liberation, of, women, than, the, contraceptive, pill, and, abortion, rights, a, study, from, universit, de, montr, al, canada, presented, a, similar, point, of, view, and, added, refrigerators, the, following, year, swedish, statistician, hans, rosling, suggested, that, the, positive, effect, the, washing, machine, had, on, the, liberation, of, women, makes, it, the, greatest, invention, of, the, industrial, revolution, it, has, been, argued, that, washing, machines, are, an, example, of, labor, saving, technology, which, does, not, decrease, employment, because, households, can, internalize, the, gains, of, the, innovation, historian, frances, finnegan, credits, the, rise, of, domestic, laundry, technology, in, helping, to, undercut, the, economic, viability, of, the, magdalene, asylums, in, ireland, later, revealed, to, be, inhumanly, abusive, prisons, for, women, by, supplanting, their, laundry, businesses, and, prompting, the, eventual, closure, of, the, institutions, as, a, whole, irish, feminist, mary, frances, mcdonald, has, described, washing, machines, as, the, single, most, life, changing, invention, for, women, in, india, dhobis, a, caste, group, specialized, in, washing, clothes, are, slowly, adapting, to, modern, technology, but, even, with, access, to, washing, machines, many, still, handwash, garments, as, well, since, most, modern, homes, are, equipped, with, a, washing, machine, many, indians, have, dispensed, with, the, services, of, the, dhobiwallahs, due, to, the, increasing, cost, of, repairs, relative, to, the, price, of, a, washing, machine, there, has, been, a, major, increase, in, the, yearly, number, of, defective, washing, machines, being, discarded, to, the, detriment, of, the, environment, the, cost, of, repair, and, the, expected, life, of, a, machine, may, make, the, purchase, of, a, new, machine, seem, like, the, better, option, different, washing, machine, models, vary, widely, in, their, use, of, water, detergent, and, energy, the, energy, required, for, heating, is, large, compared, to, that, used, by, lighting, electric, motors, and, electronic, devices, because, of, their, use, of, hot, water, washing, machines, are, among, the, largest, overall, consumers, of, energy, in, a, typical, modern, home, washing, machines, worldwide, release, around, 62, million, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, equivalent, in, a, year, however, modern, improvements, have, been, made, aiming, to, lower, these, emission, numbers, and, it, depends, on, the, user, s, choice, to, fully, determine, their,
