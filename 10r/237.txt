a, chemical, plant, is, an, industrial, process, plant, that, manufactures, or, otherwise, processes, chemicals, usually, on, a, large, scale, the, general, objective, of, a, chemical, plant, is, to, create, new, material, wealth, via, the, chemical, or, biological, transformation, and, or, separation, of, materials, chemical, plants, use, specialized, equipment, units, and, technology, in, the, manufacturing, process, other, kinds, of, plants, such, as, polymer, pharmaceutical, food, and, some, beverage, production, facilities, power, plants, oil, refineries, or, other, refineries, natural, gas, processing, and, biochemical, plants, water, and, wastewater, treatment, and, pollution, control, equipment, use, many, technologies, that, have, similarities, to, chemical, plant, technology, such, as, fluid, systems, and, chemical, reactor, systems, some, would, consider, an, oil, refinery, or, a, pharmaceutical, or, polymer, manufacturer, to, be, effectively, a, chemical, plant, petrochemical, plants, plants, using, chemicals, from, petroleum, as, a, raw, material, or, feedstock, are, usually, located, adjacent, to, an, oil, refinery, to, minimize, transportation, costs, for, the, feedstocks, produced, by, the, refinery, speciality, chemical, and, fine, chemical, plants, are, usually, much, smaller, and, not, as, sensitive, to, location, tools, have, been, developed, for, converting, a, base, project, cost, from, one, geographic, location, to, another, chemical, plants, use, chemical, processes, which, are, detailed, industrial, scale, methods, to, transform, feedstock, chemicals, into, products, the, same, chemical, process, can, be, used, at, more, than, one, chemical, plant, with, possibly, differently, scaled, capacities, at, each, plant, also, a, chemical, plant, at, a, site, may, be, constructed, to, utilize, more, than, one, chemical, process, for, instance, to, produce, multiple, products, a, chemical, plant, commonly, has, usually, large, vessels, or, sections, called, units, or, lines, that, are, interconnected, by, piping, or, other, material, moving, equipment, which, can, carry, streams, of, material, such, material, streams, can, include, fluids, gas, or, liquid, carried, in, piping, or, sometimes, solids, or, mixtures, such, as, slurries, an, overall, chemical, process, is, commonly, made, up, of, steps, called, unit, operations, which, occur, in, the, individual, units, a, raw, material, going, into, a, chemical, process, or, plant, as, input, to, be, converted, into, a, product, is, commonly, called, a, feedstock, or, simply, feed, in, addition, to, feedstocks, for, the, plant, as, a, whole, an, input, stream, of, material, to, be, processed, in, a, particular, unit, can, similarly, be, considered, feed, for, that, unit, output, streams, from, the, plant, as, a, whole, are, final, products, and, sometimes, output, streams, from, individual, units, may, be, considered, intermediate, products, for, their, units, however, final, products, from, one, plant, may, be, intermediate, chemicals, used, as, feedstock, in, another, plant, for, further, processing, for, example, some, products, from, an, oil, refinery, may, be, used, as, feedstock, in, petrochemical, plants, which, may, in, turn, produce, feedstocks, for, pharmaceutical, plants, either, the, feedstock, s, the, product, s, or, both, may, be, individual, compounds, or, mixtures, it, is, often, not, worthwhile, separating, the, components, in, these, mixtures, completely, specific, levels, of, purity, depend, on, product, requirements, and, process, economics, chemical, processes, may, be, run, in, continuous, or, batch, operation, in, batch, operation, production, occurs, in, time, sequential, steps, in, discrete, batches, a, batch, of, feedstock, s, is, fed, or, charged, into, a, process, or, unit, then, the, chemical, process, takes, place, then, the, product, s, and, any, other, outputs, are, removed, such, batch, production, may, be, repeated, over, again, and, again, with, new, batches, of, feedstock, batch, operation, is, commonly, used, in, smaller, scale, plants, such, as, pharmaceutical, or, specialty, chemicals, production, for, purposes, of, improved, traceability, as, well, as, flexibility, continuous, plants, are, usually, used, to, manufacture, commodity, or, petrochemicals, while, batch, plants, are, more, common, in, speciality, and, fine, chemical, production, as, well, as, active, pharmaceutical, ingredient, api, manufacture, in, continuous, operation, all, steps, are, ongoing, continuously, in, time, during, usual, continuous, operation, the, feeding, and, product, removal, are, ongoing, streams, of, moving, material, which, together, with, the, process, itself, all, take, place, simultaneously, and, continuously, chemical, plants, or, units, in, continuous, operation, are, usually, in, a, steady, state, or, approximate, steady, state, steady, state, means, that, quantities, related, to, the, process, do, not, change, as, time, passes, during, operation, such, constant, quantities, include, stream, flow, rates, heating, or, cooling, rates, temperatures, pressures, and, chemical, compositions, at, any, given, point, location, continuous, operation, is, more, efficient, in, many, large, scale, operations, like, petroleum, refineries, it, is, possible, for, some, units, to, operate, continuously, and, others, be, in, batch, operation, in, a, chemical, plant, for, example, see, continuous, distillation, and, batch, distillation, the, amount, of, primary, feedstock, or, product, per, unit, of, time, which, a, plant, or, unit, can, process, is, referred, to, as, the, capacity, of, that, plant, or, unit, for, examples, the, capacity, of, an, oil, refinery, may, be, given, in, terms, of, barrels, of, crude, oil, refined, per, day, alternatively, chemical, plant, capacity, may, be, given, in, tons, of, product, produced, per, day, in, actual, daily, operation, a, plant, or, unit, will, operate, at, a, percentage, of, its, full, capacity, engineers, typically, assume, 90, operating, time, for, plants, which, work, primarily, with, fluids, and, 80, uptime, for, plants, which, primarily, work, with, solids, specific, unit, operations, are, conducted, in, specific, kinds, of, units, although, some, units, may, operate, at, ambient, temperature, or, pressure, many, units, operate, at, higher, or, lower, temperatures, or, pressures, vessels, in, chemical, plants, are, often, cylindrical, with, rounded, ends, a, shape, which, can, be, suited, to, hold, either, high, pressure, or, vacuum, chemical, reactions, can, convert, certain, kinds, of, compounds, into, other, compounds, in, chemical, reactors, chemical, reactors, may, be, packed, beds, and, may, have, solid, heterogeneous, catalysts, which, stay, in, the, reactors, as, fluids, move, through, or, may, simply, be, stirred, vessels, in, which, reactions, occur, since, the, surface, of, solid, heterogeneous, catalysts, may, sometimes, become, poisoned, from, deposits, such, as, coke, regeneration, of, catalysts, may, be, necessary, fluidized, beds, may, also, be, used, in, some, cases, to, ensure, good, mixing, there, can, also, be, units, or, subunits, for, mixing, including, dissolving, separation, heating, cooling, or, some, combination, of, these, for, example, chemical, reactors, often, have, stirring, for, mixing, and, heating, or, cooling, to, maintain, temperature, when, designing, plants, on, a, large, scale, heat, produced, or, absorbed, by, chemical, reactions, must, be, considered, some, plants, may, have, units, with, organism, cultures, for, biochemical, processes, such, as, fermentation, or, enzyme, production, separation, processes, include, filtration, settling, sedimentation, extraction, or, leaching, distillation, recrystallization, or, precipitation, followed, by, filtration, or, settling, reverse, osmosis, drying, and, adsorption, heat, exchangers, are, often, used, for, heating, or, cooling, including, boiling, or, condensation, often, in, conjunction, with, other, units, such, as, distillation, towers, there, may, also, be, storage, tanks, for, storing, feedstock, intermediate, or, final, products, or, waste, storage, tanks, commonly, have, level, indicators, to, show, how, full, they, are, there, may, be, structures, holding, or, supporting, sometimes, massive, units, and, their, associated, equipment, there, are, often, stairs, ladders, or, other, steps, for, personnel, to, reach, points, in, the, units, for, sampling, inspection, or, maintenance, an, area, of, a, plant, or, facility, with, numerous, storage, tanks, is, sometimes, called, a, tank, farm, especially, at, an, oil, depot, fluid, systems, for, carrying, liquids, and, gases, include, piping, and, tubing, of, various, diameter, sizes, various, types, of, valves, for, controlling, or, stopping, flow, pumps, for, moving, or, pressurizing, liquid, and, compressors, for, pressurizing, or, moving, gases, vessels, piping, tubing, and, sometimes, other, equipment, at, high, or, very, low, temperatures, are, commonly, covered, with, insulation, for, personnel, safety, and, to, maintain, temperature, inside, fluid, systems, and, units, commonly, have, instrumentation, such, as, temperature, and, pressure, sensors, and, flow, measuring, devices, at, select, locations, in, a, plant, online, analyzers, for, chemical, or, physical, property, analysis, have, become, more, common, solvents, can, sometimes, be, used, to, dissolve, reactants, or, materials, such, as, solids, for, extraction, or, leaching, to, provide, a, suitable, medium, for, certain, chemical, reactions, to, run, or, so, they, can, otherwise, be, treated, as, fluids, today, the, fundamental, aspects, of, designing, chemical, plants, are, done, by, chemical, engineers, historically, this, was, not, always, the, case, and, many, chemical, plants, were, constructed, haphazardly, before, the, discipline, of, chemical, engineering, became, established, chemical, engineering, was, first, established, as, a, profession, in, the, united, kingdom, when, the, first, chemical, engineering, course, was, given, at, the, university, of, manchester, in, 1887, by, george, e, davis, in, the, form, of, twelve, lectures, covering, various, aspects, of, industrial, chemical, practice, as, a, consequence, george, e, davis, is, regarded, as, the, world, s, first, chemical, engineer, today, chemical, engineering, is, a, profession, and, those, professional, chemical, engineers, with, experience, can, gain, chartered, engineer, status, through, the, institution, of, chemical, engineers, in, plant, design, typically, less, than, 1, percent, of, ideas, for, new, designs, ever, become, commercialized, during, this, solution, process, typically, cost, studies, are, used, as, an, initial, screening, to, eliminate, unprofitable, designs, if, a, process, appears, profitable, then, other, factors, are, considered, such, as, safety, environmental, constraints, controllability, etc, the, general, goal, in, plant, design, is, to, construct, or, synthesize, optimum, designs, in, the, neighborhood, of, the, desired, constraints, many, times, chemists, research, chemical, reactions, or, other, chemical, principles, in, a, laboratory, commonly, on, a, small, scale, in, a, batch, type, experiment, chemistry, information, obtained, is, then, used, by, chemical, engineers, along, with, expertise, of, their, own, to, convert, to, a, chemical, process, and, scale, up, the, batch, size, or, capacity, commonly, a, small, chemical, plant, called, a, pilot, plant, is, built, to, provide, design, and, operating, information, before, construction, of, a, large, plant, from, data, and, operating, experience, obtained, from, the, pilot, plant, a, scaled, up, plant, can, be, designed, for, higher, or, full, capacity, after, the, fundamental, aspects, of, a, plant, design, are, determined, mechanical, or, electrical, engineers, may, become, involved, with, mechanical, or, electrical, details, respectively, structural, engineers, may, become, involved, in, the, plant, design, to, ensure, the, structures, can, support, the, weight, of, the, units, piping, and, other, equipment, the, units, streams, and, fluid, systems, of, chemical, plants, or, processes, can, be, represented, by, block, flow, diagrams, which, are, very, simplified, diagrams, or, process, flow, diagrams, which, are, somewhat, more, detailed, the, streams, and, other, piping, are, shown, as, lines, with, arrow, heads, showing, usual, direction, of, material, flow, in, block, diagrams, units, are, often, simply, shown, as, blocks, process, flow, diagrams, may, use, more, detailed, symbols, and, show, pumps, compressors, and, major, valves, likely, values, or, ranges, of, material, flow, rates, for, the, various, streams, are, determined, based, on, desired, plant, capacity, using, material, balance, calculations, energy, balances, are, also, done, based, on, heats, of, reaction, heat, capacities, expected, temperatures, and, pressures, at, various, points, to, calculate, amounts, of, heating, and, cooling, needed, in, various, places, and, to, size, heat, exchangers, chemical, plant, design, can, be, shown, in, fuller, detail, in, a, piping, and, instrumentation, diagram, p, id, which, shows, all, piping, tubing, valves, and, instrumentation, typically, with, special, symbols, showing, a, full, plant, is, often, complicated, in, a, p, id, so, often, only, individual, units, or, specific, fluid, systems, are, shown, in, a, single, p, id, in, the, plant, design, the, units, are, sized, for, the, maximum, capacity, each, may, have, to, handle, similarly, sizes, for, pipes, pumps, compressors, and, associated, equipment, are, chosen, for, the, flow, capacity, they, have, to, handle, utility, systems, such, as, electric, power, and, water, supply, should, also, be, included, in, the, plant, design, additional, piping, lines, for, non, routine, or, alternate, operating, procedures, such, as, plant, or, unit, startups, and, shutdowns, may, have, to, be, included, fluid, systems, design, commonly, includes, isolation, valves, around, various, units, or, parts, of, a, plant, so, that, a, section, of, a, plant, could, be, isolated, in, case, of, a, problem, such, as, a, leak, in, a, unit, if, pneumatically, or, hydraulically, actuated, valves, are, used, a, system, of, pressurizing, lines, to, the, actuators, is, needed, any, points, where, process, samples, may, have, to, be, taken, should, have, sampling, lines, valves, and, access, to, them, included, in, the, detailed, design, if, necessary, provisions, should, be, made, for, reducing, high, pressure, or, temperature, of, a, sampling, stream, such, including, a, pressure, reducing, valve, or, sample, cooler, units, and, fluid, systems, in, the, plant, including, all, vessels, piping, tubing, valves, pumps, compressors, and, other, equipment, must, be, rated, or, designed, to, be, able, to, withstand, the, entire, range, of, pressures, temperatures, and, other, conditions, which, they, could, possibly, encounter, including, any, appropriate, safety, factors, all, such, units, and, equipment, should, also, be, checked, for, materials, compatibility, to, ensure, they, can, withstand, long, term, exposure, to, the, chemicals, they, will, come, in, contact, with, any, closed, system, in, a, plant, which, has, a, means, of, pressurizing, possibly, beyond, the, rating, of, its, equipment, such, as, heating, exothermic, reactions, or, certain, pumps, or, compressors, should, have, an, appropriately, sized, pressure, relief, valve, included, to, prevent, overpressurization, for, safety, frequently, all, of, these, parameters, temperatures, pressures, flow, etc, are, exhaustively, analyzed, in, combination, through, a, hazop, or, fault, tree, analysis, to, ensure, that, the, plant, has, no, known, risk, of, serious, hazard, within, any, constraints, the, plant, is, subject, to, design, parameters, are, optimized, for, good, economic, performance, while, ensuring, the, safety, and, welfare, of, personnel, and, the, surrounding, community, for, flexibility, a, plant, may, be, designed, to, operate, in, a, range, around, some, optimal, design, parameters, in, case, feedstock, or, economic, conditions, change, and, re, optimization, is, desirable, in, more, modern, times, computer, simulations, or, other, computer, calculations, have, been, used, to, help, in, chemical, plant, design, or, optimization, in, process, control, information, gathered, automatically, from, various, sensors, or, other, devices, in, the, plant, is, used, to, control, various, equipment, for, running, the, plant, thereby, controlling, operation, of, the, plant, instruments, receiving, such, information, signals, and, sending, out, control, signals, to, perform, this, function, automatically, are, process, controllers, previously, pneumatic, controls, were, sometimes, used, electrical, controls, are, now, common, a, plant, often, has, a, control, room, with, displays, of, parameters, such, as, key, temperatures, pressures, fluid, flow, rates, and, levels, operating, positions, of, key, valves, pumps, and, other, equipment, etc, in, addition, operators, in, the, control, room, can, control, various, aspects, of, the, plant, operation, often, including, overriding, automatic, control, process, control, with, a, computer, represents, more, modern, technology, based, on, possible, changing, feedstock, composition, changing, products, requirements, or, economics, or, other, changes, in, constraints, operating, conditions, may, be, re, optimized, to, maximize, profit, as, in, any, industrial, setting, there, are, a, variety, of, workers, working, throughout, a, chemical, plant, facility, often, organized, into, departments, sections, or, other, work, groups, such, workers, typically, include, engineers, plant, operators, and, maintenance, technicians, other, personnel, at, the, site, could, include, chemists, management, administration, and, office, workers, types, of, engineers, involved, in, operations, or, maintenance, may, include, chemical, process, engineers, mechanical, engineers, for, maintaining, mechanical, equipment, and, electrical, computer, engineers, for, electrical, or, computer, equipment, large, quantities, of, fluid, feedstock, or, product, may, enter, or, leave, a, plant, by, pipeline, railroad, tank, car, or, tanker, truck, for, example, petroleum, commonly, comes, to, a, refinery, by, pipeline, pipelines, can, also, carry, petrochemical, feedstock, from, a, refinery, to, a, nearby, petrochemical, plant, natural, gas, is, a, product, which, comes, all, the, way, from, a, natural, gas, processing, plant, to, final, consumers, by, pipeline, or, tubing, large, quantities, of, liquid, feedstock, are, typically, pumped, into, process, units, smaller, quantities, of, feedstock, or, product, may, be, shipped, to, or, from, a, plant, in, drums, use, of, drums, about, 55, gallons, in, capacity, is, common, for, packaging, industrial, quantities, of, chemicals, smaller, batches, of, feedstock, may, be, added, from, drums, or, other, containers, to, process, units, by, workers, in, addition, to, feeding, and, operating, the, plant, and, packaging, or, preparing, the, product, for, shipping, plant, workers, are, needed, for, taking, samples, for, routine, and, troubleshooting, analysis, and, for, performing, routine, and, non, routine, maintenance, routine, maintenance, can, include, periodic, inspections, and, replacement, of, worn, catalyst, analyzer, reagents, various, sensors, or, mechanical, parts, non, routine, maintenance, can, include, investigating, problems, and, then, fixing, them, such, as, leaks, failure, to, meet, feed, or, product, specifications, mechanical, failures, of, valves, pumps, compressors, sensors, etc, when, working, with, chemicals, safety, is, a, concern, in, order, to, avoid, problems, such, as, chemical, accidents, in, the, united, states, the, law, requires, that, employers, provide, workers, working, with, chemicals, with, access, to, a, material, safety, data, sheet, msds, for, every, kind, of, chemical, they, work, with, an, msds, for, a, certain, chemical, is, prepared, and, provided, by, the, supplier, to, whoever, buys, the, chemical, other, laws, covering, chemical, safety, hazardous, waste, and, pollution, must, be, observed, including, statutes, such, as, the, resource, conservation, and, recovery, act, rcra, and, the, toxic, substances, control, act, tsca, and, regulations, such, as, the, chemical, facility, anti, terrorism, standards, in, the, united, states, hazmat, hazardous, materials, teams, are, trained, to, deal, with, chemical, leaks, or, spills, process, hazard, analysis, pha, is, used, to, assess, potential, hazards, in, chemical, plants, in, 1998, the, u, s, chemical, safety, and, hazard, investigation, board, has, become, operational, chemical, plants, used, particularly, for, commodity, chemical, and, petrochemical, manufacture, are, located, in, relatively, few, manufacturing, locations, around, the, world, largely, due, to, infrastructural, needs, this, is, less, important, for, speciality, or, fine, chemical, batch, plants, not, all, commodity, petrochemicals, are, produced, in, any, one, location, but, groups, of, related, materials, often, are, to, induce, industrial, symbiosis, as, well, as, material, energy, and, utility, efficiency, and, other, economies, of, scale, these, manufacturing, locations, often, have, business, clusters, of, units, called, chemical, plants, that, share, utilities, and, large, scale, infrastructure, such, as, power, stations, port, facilities, road, and, rail, terminals, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, there, are, four, main, locations, for, commodity, chemical, manufacture, near, the, river, mersey, in, northwest, england, on, the, humber, on, the, east, coast, of, yorkshire, in, grangemouth, near, the, firth, of, forth, in, scotland, and, on, teesside, as, part, of, the, northeast, of, england, process, industry, cluster, nepic, approximately, 50, of, the, uk, s, petrochemicals, which, are, also, commodity, chemicals, are, produced, by, the, industry, cluster, companies, on, teesside, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, tees, on, three, large, chemical, parks, at, wilton, billingham, and, seal, sands, corrosion, in, chemical, process, plants, is, a, major, issue, that, consumes, billions, of, dollars, yearly, electrochemical, corrosion, of, metals, is, pronounced, in, chemical, process, plants, due, to, the, presence, of, acid, fumes, and, other, electrolytic, interactions, recently, frp, fibre, reinforced, plastic, is, used, as, a, material, of, construction, the, british, standard, specification, bs4994, is, widely, used, for, design, and, construction, of, the, vessels, tanks, etc
