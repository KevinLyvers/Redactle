sound, recording, and, reproduction, is, the, electrical, mechanical, electronic, or, digital, inscription, and, re, creation, of, sound, waves, such, as, spoken, voice, singing, instrumental, music, or, sound, effects, the, two, main, classes, of, sound, recording, technology, are, analog, recording, and, digital, recording, acoustic, analog, recording, is, achieved, by, a, microphone, diaphragm, that, senses, changes, in, atmospheric, pressure, caused, by, acoustic, sound, waves, and, records, them, as, a, mechanical, representation, of, the, sound, waves, on, a, medium, such, as, a, phonograph, record, in, which, a, stylus, cuts, grooves, on, a, record, in, magnetic, tape, recording, the, sound, waves, vibrate, the, microphone, diaphragm, and, are, converted, into, a, varying, electric, current, which, is, then, converted, to, a, varying, magnetic, field, by, an, electromagnet, which, makes, a, representation, of, the, sound, as, magnetized, areas, on, a, plastic, tape, with, a, magnetic, coating, on, it, analog, sound, reproduction, is, the, reverse, process, with, a, larger, loudspeaker, diaphragm, causing, changes, to, atmospheric, pressure, to, form, acoustic, sound, waves, digital, recording, and, reproduction, converts, the, analog, sound, signal, picked, up, by, the, microphone, to, a, digital, form, by, the, process, of, sampling, this, lets, the, audio, data, be, stored, and, transmitted, by, a, wider, variety, of, media, digital, recording, stores, audio, as, a, series, of, binary, numbers, zeros, and, ones, representing, samples, of, the, amplitude, of, the, audio, signal, at, equal, time, intervals, at, a, sample, rate, high, enough, to, convey, all, sounds, capable, of, being, heard, a, digital, audio, signal, must, be, reconverted, to, analog, form, during, playback, before, it, is, amplified, and, connected, to, a, loudspeaker, to, produce, sound, long, before, sound, was, first, recorded, music, was, recorded, first, by, written, music, notation, then, also, by, mechanical, devices, e, g, wind, up, music, boxes, in, which, a, mechanism, turns, a, spindle, which, plucks, metal, tines, thus, reproducing, a, melody, automatic, music, reproduction, traces, back, as, far, as, the, 9th, century, when, the, ban, m, s, brothers, invented, the, earliest, known, mechanical, musical, instrument, in, this, case, a, hydropowered, water, powered, organ, that, played, interchangeable, cylinders, according, to, charles, b, fowler, this, cylinder, with, raised, pins, on, the, surface, remained, the, basic, device, to, produce, and, reproduce, music, mechanically, until, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, carvings, in, the, rosslyn, chapel, from, the, 1560s, may, represent, an, early, attempt, to, record, the, chladni, patterns, produced, by, sound, in, stone, representations, although, this, theory, has, not, been, conclusively, proved, in, the, 14th, century, a, mechanical, bell, ringer, controlled, by, a, rotating, cylinder, was, introduced, in, flanders, similar, designs, appeared, in, barrel, organs, 15th, century, musical, clocks, 1598, barrel, pianos, 1805, and, music, boxes, c, 1800, a, music, box, is, an, automatic, musical, instrument, that, produces, sounds, by, the, use, of, a, set, of, pins, placed, on, a, revolving, cylinder, or, disc, so, as, to, pluck, the, tuned, teeth, or, lamellae, of, a, steel, comb, the, fairground, organ, developed, in, 1892, used, a, system, of, accordion, folded, punched, cardboard, books, the, player, piano, first, demonstrated, in, 1876, used, a, punched, paper, scroll, that, could, store, a, long, piece, of, music, the, most, sophisticated, of, the, piano, rolls, were, hand, played, meaning, that, they, were, duplicates, from, a, master, roll, which, had, been, created, on, a, special, piano, which, punched, holes, in, the, master, as, a, live, performer, played, the, song, thus, the, roll, represented, a, recording, of, the, actual, performance, of, an, individual, not, just, the, more, common, method, of, punching, the, master, roll, through, transcription, of, the, sheet, music, this, technology, to, record, a, live, performance, onto, a, piano, roll, was, not, developed, until, 1904, piano, rolls, were, in, continuous, mass, production, from, 1896, to, 2008, a, 1908, u, s, supreme, court, copyright, case, noted, that, in, 1902, alone, there, were, between, 70, 000, and, 75, 000, player, pianos, manufactured, and, between, 1, 000, 000, and, 1, 500, 000, piano, rolls, produced, the, first, device, that, could, record, actual, sounds, as, they, passed, through, the, air, but, could, not, play, them, back, the, purpose, was, only, visual, study, was, the, phonautograph, patented, in, 1857, by, parisian, inventor, douard, l, on, scott, de, martinville, the, earliest, known, recordings, of, the, human, voice, are, phonautograph, recordings, called, phonautograms, made, in, 1857, they, consist, of, sheets, of, paper, with, sound, wave, modulated, white, lines, created, by, a, vibrating, stylus, that, cut, through, a, coating, of, soot, as, the, paper, was, passed, under, it, an, 1860, phonautogram, of, au, clair, de, la, lune, a, french, folk, song, was, played, back, as, sound, for, the, first, time, in, 2008, by, scanning, it, and, using, software, to, convert, the, undulating, line, which, graphically, encoded, the, sound, into, a, corresponding, digital, audio, file, thomas, edison, s, work, on, two, other, innovations, the, telegraph, and, the, telephone, led, to, the, development, of, the, phonograph, edison, was, working, on, a, machine, in, 1877, that, would, transcribe, telegraphic, signals, onto, paper, tape, which, could, then, be, transferred, over, the, telegraph, again, and, again, the, phonograph, was, both, in, a, cylinder, and, a, disc, form, on, april, 30, 1877, french, poet, humorous, writer, and, inventor, charles, cros, submitted, a, sealed, envelope, containing, a, letter, to, the, academy, of, sciences, in, paris, fully, explaining, his, proposed, method, called, the, paleophone, though, no, trace, of, a, working, paleophone, was, ever, found, cros, is, remembered, by, some, historians, as, an, early, inventor, of, a, sound, recording, and, reproduction, machine, the, first, practical, sound, recording, and, reproduction, device, was, the, mechanical, phonograph, cylinder, invented, by, thomas, edison, in, 1877, and, patented, in, 1878, the, invention, soon, spread, across, the, globe, and, over, the, next, two, decades, the, commercial, recording, distribution, and, sale, of, sound, recordings, became, a, growing, new, international, industry, with, the, most, popular, titles, selling, millions, of, units, by, the, early, 1900s, a, process, for, mass, producing, duplicate, wax, cylinders, by, molding, instead, of, engraving, them, was, put, into, effect, in, 1901, the, development, of, mass, production, techniques, enabled, cylinder, recordings, to, become, a, major, new, consumer, item, in, industrial, countries, and, the, cylinder, was, the, main, consumer, format, from, the, late, 1880s, until, around, 1910, the, next, major, technical, development, was, the, invention, of, the, gramophone, record, generally, credited, to, emile, berliner, and, patented, in, 1887, though, others, had, demonstrated, similar, disk, apparatus, earlier, most, notably, alexander, graham, bell, in, 1881, discs, were, easier, to, manufacture, transport, and, store, and, they, had, the, additional, benefit, of, being, marginally, louder, than, cylinders, sales, of, the, gramophone, record, overtook, the, cylinder, ca, 1910, and, by, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, disc, had, become, the, dominant, commercial, recording, format, edison, who, was, the, main, producer, of, cylinders, created, the, edison, disc, record, in, an, attempt, to, regain, his, market, the, double, sided, nominally, 78, rpm, shellac, disc, was, the, standard, consumer, music, format, from, the, early, 1910s, to, the, late, 1950s, in, various, permutations, the, audio, disc, format, became, the, primary, medium, for, consumer, sound, recordings, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, although, there, was, no, universally, accepted, speed, and, various, companies, offered, discs, that, played, at, several, different, speeds, the, major, recording, companies, eventually, settled, on, a, de, facto, industry, standard, of, nominally, 78, revolutions, per, minute, the, specified, speed, was, 78, 26, rpm, in, america, and, 77, 92, rpm, throughout, the, rest, of, the, world, the, difference, in, speeds, was, due, to, the, difference, in, the, cycle, frequencies, of, the, ac, electricity, that, powered, the, stroboscopes, used, to, calibrate, recording, lathes, and, turntables, the, nominal, speed, of, the, disc, format, gave, rise, to, its, common, nickname, the, seventy, eight, though, not, until, other, speeds, had, become, available, discs, were, made, of, shellac, or, similar, brittle, plastic, like, materials, played, with, needles, made, from, a, variety, of, materials, including, mild, steel, thorn, and, even, sapphire, discs, had, a, distinctly, limited, playing, life, that, varied, depending, on, how, they, were, manufactured, earlier, purely, acoustic, methods, of, recording, had, limited, sensitivity, and, frequency, range, mid, frequency, range, notes, could, be, recorded, but, very, low, and, very, high, frequencies, could, not, instruments, such, as, the, violin, were, difficult, to, transfer, to, disc, one, technique, to, deal, with, this, involved, using, a, stroh, violin, which, uses, a, conical, horn, connected, to, a, diaphragm, that, in, turn, is, connected, to, the, violin, bridge, the, horn, was, no, longer, needed, once, electrical, recording, was, developed, the, long, playing, 33, 1, 3, rpm, microgroove, lp, record, was, developed, at, columbia, records, and, introduced, in, 1948, the, short, playing, but, convenient, 7, inch, 18, cm, 45, rpm, microgroove, vinyl, single, was, introduced, by, rca, victor, in, 1949, in, the, us, and, most, developed, countries, the, two, new, vinyl, formats, completely, replaced, 78, rpm, shellac, discs, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, but, in, some, corners, of, the, world, the, 78, lingered, on, far, into, the, 1960s, vinyl, was, much, more, expensive, than, shellac, one, of, the, several, factors, that, made, its, use, for, 78, rpm, records, very, unusual, but, with, a, long, playing, disc, the, added, cost, was, acceptable, the, compact, 45, format, required, very, little, material, vinyl, offered, improved, performance, both, in, stamping, and, in, playback, vinyl, records, were, over, optimistically, advertised, as, unbreakable, they, were, not, but, they, were, much, less, fragile, than, shellac, which, had, itself, once, been, touted, as, unbreakable, compared, to, wax, cylinders, sound, recording, began, as, a, purely, mechanical, process, except, for, a, few, crude, telephone, based, recording, devices, with, no, means, of, amplification, such, as, the, telegraphone, it, remained, so, until, the, 1920s, between, the, invention, of, the, phonograph, in, 1877, and, the, first, commercial, digital, recordings, in, the, early, 1970s, arguably, the, most, important, milestone, in, the, history, of, sound, recording, was, the, introduction, of, what, was, then, called, electrical, recording, in, which, a, microphone, was, used, to, convert, the, sound, into, an, electrical, signal, that, was, amplified, and, used, to, actuate, the, recording, stylus, this, innovation, eliminated, the, horn, sound, resonances, characteristic, of, the, acoustical, process, produced, clearer, and, more, full, bodied, recordings, by, greatly, extending, the, useful, range, of, audio, frequencies, and, allowed, previously, unrecordable, distant, and, feeble, sounds, to, be, captured, during, this, time, several, radio, related, developments, in, electronics, converged, to, revolutionize, the, recording, process, these, included, improved, microphones, and, auxiliary, devices, such, as, electronic, filters, all, dependent, on, electronic, amplification, to, be, of, practical, use, in, recording, in, 1906, lee, de, forest, invented, the, audion, triode, vacuum, tube, an, electronic, valve, that, could, amplify, weak, electrical, signals, by, 1915, it, was, in, use, in, long, distance, telephone, circuits, that, made, conversations, between, new, york, and, san, francisco, practical, refined, versions, of, this, tube, were, the, basis, of, all, electronic, sound, systems, until, the, commercial, introduction, of, the, first, transistor, based, audio, devices, in, the, mid, 1950s, during, world, war, i, engineers, in, the, united, states, and, great, britain, worked, on, ways, to, record, and, reproduce, among, other, things, the, sound, of, a, german, u, boat, for, training, purposes, acoustical, recording, methods, of, the, time, could, not, reproduce, the, sounds, accurately, the, earliest, results, were, not, promising, the, first, electrical, recording, issued, to, the, public, with, little, fanfare, was, of, november, 11, 1920, funeral, service, for, the, unknown, warrior, in, westminster, abbey, london, the, recording, engineers, used, microphones, of, the, type, used, in, contemporary, telephones, four, were, discreetly, set, up, in, the, abbey, and, wired, to, recording, equipment, in, a, vehicle, outside, although, electronic, amplification, was, used, the, audio, was, weak, and, unclear, as, only, possible, in, those, circumstances, for, several, years, this, little, noted, disc, remained, the, only, issued, electrical, recording, several, record, companies, and, independent, inventors, notably, orlando, marsh, experimented, with, equipment, and, techniques, for, electrical, recording, in, the, early, 1920s, marsh, s, electrically, recorded, autograph, records, were, already, being, sold, to, the, public, in, 1924, a, year, before, the, first, such, offerings, from, the, major, record, companies, but, their, overall, sound, quality, was, too, low, to, demonstrate, any, obvious, advantage, over, traditional, acoustical, methods, marsh, s, microphone, technique, was, idiosyncratic, and, his, work, had, little, if, any, impact, on, the, systems, being, developed, by, others, telephone, industry, giant, western, electric, had, research, laboratories, with, material, and, human, resources, that, no, record, company, or, independent, inventor, could, match, they, had, the, best, microphone, a, condenser, type, developed, there, in, 1916, and, greatly, improved, in, 1922, and, the, best, amplifiers, and, test, equipment, they, had, already, patented, an, electromechanical, recorder, in, 1918, and, in, the, early, 1920s, they, decided, to, intensively, apply, their, hardware, and, expertise, to, developing, two, state, of, the, art, systems, for, electronically, recording, and, reproducing, sound, one, that, employed, conventional, discs, and, another, that, recorded, optically, on, motion, picture, film, their, engineers, pioneered, the, use, of, mechanical, analogs, of, electrical, circuits, and, developed, a, superior, rubber, line, recorder, for, cutting, the, groove, into, the, wax, master, in, the, disc, recording, system, by, 1924, such, dramatic, progress, had, been, made, that, western, electric, arranged, a, demonstration, for, the, two, leading, record, companies, the, victor, talking, machine, company, and, the, columbia, phonograph, company, both, soon, licensed, the, system, and, both, made, their, earliest, published, electrical, recordings, in, february, 1925, but, neither, actually, released, them, until, several, months, later, to, avoid, making, their, existing, catalogs, instantly, obsolete, the, two, long, time, archrivals, agreed, privately, not, to, publicize, the, new, process, until, november, 1925, by, which, time, enough, electrically, recorded, repertory, would, be, available, to, meet, the, anticipated, demand, during, the, next, few, years, the, lesser, record, companies, licensed, or, developed, other, electrical, recording, systems, by, 1929, only, the, budget, label, harmony, was, still, issuing, new, recordings, made, by, the, old, acoustical, process, comparison, of, some, surviving, western, electric, test, recordings, with, early, commercial, releases, indicates, that, the, record, companies, artificially, reduced, the, frequency, range, of, recordings, so, they, would, not, overwhelm, non, electronic, playback, equipment, which, reproduced, very, low, frequencies, as, an, unpleasant, rattle, and, rapidly, wore, out, discs, with, strongly, recorded, high, frequencies, in, the, 1920s, phonofilm, and, other, early, motion, picture, sound, systems, employed, optical, recording, technology, in, which, the, audio, signal, was, graphically, recorded, on, photographic, film, the, amplitude, variations, comprising, the, signal, were, used, to, modulate, a, light, source, which, was, imaged, onto, the, moving, film, through, a, narrow, slit, allowing, the, signal, to, be, photographed, as, variations, in, the, density, or, width, of, a, sound, track, the, projector, used, a, steady, light, and, a, photodetector, to, convert, these, variations, back, into, an, electrical, signal, which, was, amplified, and, sent, to, loudspeakers, behind, the, screen, optical, sound, became, the, standard, motion, picture, audio, system, throughout, the, world, and, remains, so, for, theatrical, release, prints, despite, attempts, in, the, 1950s, to, substitute, magnetic, soundtracks, currently, all, release, prints, on, 35, mm, movie, film, include, an, analog, optical, soundtrack, usually, stereo, with, dolby, sr, noise, reduction, in, addition, an, optically, recorded, digital, soundtrack, in, dolby, digital, or, sony, sdds, form, is, likely, to, be, present, an, optically, recorded, timecode, is, also, commonly, included, to, synchronize, cdroms, that, contain, a, dts, soundtrack, this, period, also, saw, several, other, historic, developments, including, the, introduction, of, the, first, practical, magnetic, sound, recording, system, the, magnetic, wire, recorder, which, was, based, on, the, work, of, danish, inventor, valdemar, poulsen, magnetic, wire, recorders, were, effective, but, the, sound, quality, was, poor, so, between, the, wars, they, were, primarily, used, for, voice, recording, and, marketed, as, business, dictating, machines, in, 1924, a, german, engineer, kurt, stille, improved, the, telegraphone, with, an, electronic, amplifier, the, following, year, ludwig, blattner, began, work, that, eventually, produced, the, blattnerphone, which, used, steel, tape, instead, of, wire, the, bbc, started, using, blattnerphones, in, 1930, to, record, radio, programs, in, 1933, radio, pioneer, guglielmo, marconi, s, company, purchased, the, rights, to, the, blattnerphone, and, newly, developed, marconi, stille, recorders, were, installed, in, the, bbc, s, maida, vale, studios, in, march, 1935, the, tape, used, in, blattnerphones, and, marconi, stille, recorders, was, the, same, material, used, to, make, razor, blades, and, not, surprisingly, the, fearsome, marconi, stille, recorders, were, considered, so, dangerous, that, technicians, had, to, operate, them, from, another, room, for, safety, because, of, the, high, recording, speeds, required, they, used, enormous, reels, about, one, meter, in, diameter, and, the, thin, tape, frequently, broke, sending, jagged, lengths, of, razor, steel, flying, around, the, studio, magnetic, tape, recording, uses, an, amplified, electrical, audio, signal, to, generate, analogous, variations, of, the, magnetic, field, produced, by, a, tape, head, which, impresses, corresponding, variations, of, magnetization, on, the, moving, tape, in, playback, mode, the, signal, path, is, reversed, the, tape, head, acting, as, a, miniature, electric, generator, as, the, varyingly, magnetized, tape, passes, over, it, the, original, solid, steel, ribbon, was, replaced, by, a, much, more, practical, coated, paper, tape, but, acetate, soon, replaced, paper, as, the, standard, tape, base, acetate, has, fairly, low, tensile, strength, and, if, very, thin, it, will, snap, easily, so, it, was, in, turn, eventually, superseded, by, polyester, this, technology, the, basis, for, almost, all, commercial, recording, from, the, 1950s, to, the, 1980s, was, developed, in, the, 1930s, by, german, audio, engineers, who, also, rediscovered, the, principle, of, ac, biasing, first, used, in, the, 1920s, for, wire, recorders, which, dramatically, improved, the, frequency, response, of, tape, recordings, the, k1, magnetophon, was, the, first, practical, tape, recorder, developed, by, aeg, in, germany, in, 1935, the, technology, was, further, improved, just, after, world, war, ii, by, american, audio, engineer, john, t, mullin, with, backing, from, bing, crosby, enterprises, mullin, s, pioneering, recorders, were, modifications, of, captured, german, recorders, in, the, late, 1940s, the, ampex, company, produced, the, first, tape, recorders, commercially, available, in, the, us, magnetic, tape, brought, about, sweeping, changes, in, both, radio, and, the, recording, industry, sound, could, be, recorded, erased, and, re, recorded, on, the, same, tape, many, times, sounds, could, be, duplicated, from, tape, to, tape, with, only, minor, loss, of, quality, and, recordings, could, now, be, very, precisely, edited, by, physically, cutting, the, tape, and, rejoining, it, within, a, few, years, of, the, introduction, of, the, first, commercial, tape, recorder, the, ampex, 200, model, launched, in, 1948, american, musician, inventor, les, paul, had, invented, the, first, multitrack, tape, recorder, ushering, in, another, technical, revolution, in, the, recording, industry, tape, made, possible, the, first, sound, recordings, totally, created, by, electronic, means, opening, the, way, for, the, bold, sonic, experiments, of, the, musique, concr, te, school, and, avant, garde, composers, like, karlheinz, stockhausen, which, in, turn, led, to, the, innovative, pop, music, recordings, of, artists, such, as, the, beatles, and, the, beach, boys, the, ease, and, accuracy, of, tape, editing, as, compared, to, the, cumbersome, disc, to, disc, editing, procedures, previously, in, some, limited, use, together, with, tape, s, consistently, high, audio, quality, finally, convinced, radio, networks, to, routinely, prerecord, their, entertainment, programming, most, of, which, had, formerly, been, broadcast, live, also, for, the, first, time, broadcasters, regulators, and, other, interested, parties, were, able, to, undertake, comprehensive, audio, logging, of, each, day, s, radio, broadcasts, innovations, like, multitracking, and, tape, echo, allowed, radio, programs, and, advertisements, to, be, produced, to, a, high, level, of, complexity, and, sophistication, the, combined, impact, with, innovations, such, as, the, endless, loop, broadcast, cartridge, led, to, significant, changes, in, the, pacing, and, production, style, of, radio, program, content, and, advertising, in, 1881, it, was, noted, during, experiments, in, transmitting, sound, from, the, paris, opera, that, it, was, possible, to, follow, the, movement, of, singers, on, the, stage, if, earpieces, connected, to, different, microphones, were, held, to, the, two, ears, this, discovery, was, commercialized, in, 1890, with, the, th, trophone, system, which, operated, for, over, forty, years, until, 1932, in, 1931, alan, blumlein, a, british, electronics, engineer, working, for, emi, designed, a, way, to, make, the, sound, of, an, actor, in, a, film, follow, his, movement, across, the, screen, in, december, 1931, he, submitted, a, patent, application, including, the, idea, and, in, 1933, this, became, uk, patent, number, 394, 325, over, the, next, two, years, blumlein, developed, stereo, microphones, and, a, stereo, disc, cutting, head, and, recorded, a, number, of, short, films, with, stereo, soundtracks, in, the, 1930s, experiments, with, magnetic, tape, enabled, the, development, of, the, first, practical, commercial, sound, systems, that, could, record, and, reproduce, high, fidelity, stereophonic, sound, the, experiments, with, stereo, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, were, hampered, by, problems, with, synchronization, a, major, breakthrough, in, practical, stereo, sound, was, made, by, bell, laboratories, who, in, 1937, demonstrated, a, practical, system, of, two, channel, stereo, using, dual, optical, sound, tracks, on, film, major, movie, studios, quickly, developed, three, track, and, four, track, sound, systems, and, the, first, stereo, sound, recording, for, a, commercial, film, was, made, by, judy, garland, for, the, mgm, movie, listen, darling, in, 1938, the, first, commercially, released, movie, with, a, stereo, soundtrack, was, walt, disney, s, fantasia, released, in, 1940, the, 1941, release, of, fantasia, used, the, fantasound, sound, system, this, system, used, a, separate, film, for, the, sound, synchronized, with, the, film, carrying, the, picture, the, sound, film, had, four, double, width, optical, soundtracks, three, for, left, center, and, right, audio, and, a, fourth, as, a, control, track, with, three, recorded, tones, that, controlled, the, playback, volume, of, the, three, audio, channels, because, of, the, complex, equipment, this, system, required, disney, exhibited, the, movie, as, a, roadshow, and, only, in, the, united, states, regular, releases, of, the, movie, used, standard, mono, optical, 35, mm, stock, until, 1956, when, disney, released, the, film, with, a, stereo, soundtrack, that, used, the, cinemascope, four, track, magnetic, sound, system, german, audio, engineers, working, on, magnetic, tape, developed, stereo, recording, by, 1941, of, 250, stereophonic, recordings, made, during, ww2, only, three, survive, beethoven, s, 5th, piano, concerto, with, walter, gieseking, and, arthur, rother, a, brahms, serenade, and, the, last, movement, of, bruckner, s, 8th, symphony, with, von, karajan, other, early, german, stereophonic, tapes, are, believed, to, have, been, destroyed, in, bombings, not, until, ampex, introduced, the, first, commercial, two, track, tape, recorders, in, the, late, 1940s, did, stereo, tape, recording, become, commercially, feasible, despite, the, availability, of, multitrack, tape, stereo, did, not, become, the, standard, system, for, commercial, music, recording, for, some, years, and, remained, a, specialist, market, during, the, 1950s, emi, uk, was, the, first, company, to, release, commercial, stereophonic, tapes, they, issued, their, first, stereosonic, tape, in, 1954, others, quickly, followed, under, the, his, master, s, voice, hmv, and, columbia, labels, 161, stereosonic, tapes, were, released, mostly, classical, music, or, lyric, recordings, rca, imported, these, tapes, into, the, usa, although, some, hmv, tapes, released, in, the, usa, cost, up, to, 15, two, track, stereophonic, tapes, were, more, successful, in, america, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1950s, the, history, of, stereo, recording, changed, after, the, late, 1957, introduction, of, the, westrex, stereo, phonograph, disc, which, used, the, groove, format, developed, earlier, by, blumlein, decca, records, in, england, came, out, with, ffrr, full, frequency, range, recording, in, the, 1940s, which, became, internationally, accepted, as, a, worldwide, standard, for, higher, quality, recording, on, vinyl, records, the, ernest, ansermet, recording, of, igor, stravinsky, s, petrushka, was, key, in, the, development, of, full, frequency, range, records, and, alerting, the, listening, public, to, high, fidelity, in, 1946, until, the, mid, 1960s, record, companies, mixed, and, released, most, popular, music, in, monophonic, sound, from, mid, 1960s, until, the, early, 1970s, major, recordings, were, commonly, released, in, both, mono, and, stereo, recordings, originally, released, only, in, mono, have, been, rerendered, and, released, in, stereo, using, a, variety, of, techniques, from, remixing, to, pseudostereo, magnetic, tape, transformed, the, recording, industry, by, the, early, 1950s, most, commercial, recordings, were, mastered, on, tape, instead, of, recorded, directly, to, disc, tape, facilitated, a, degree, of, manipulation, in, the, recording, process, that, was, impractical, with, mixes, and, multiple, generations, of, directly, recorded, discs, an, early, example, is, les, paul, s, 1951, recording, of, how, high, the, moon, on, which, paul, played, eight, overdubbed, guitar, tracks, in, the, 1960s, brian, wilson, of, the, beach, boys, frank, zappa, and, the, beatles, with, producer, george, martin, were, among, the, first, popular, artists, to, explore, the, possibilities, of, multitrack, recording, techniques, and, effects, on, their, landmark, albums, pet, sounds, freak, out, and, sgt, pepper, s, lonely, hearts, club, band, the, next, important, innovation, was, small, cartridge, based, tape, systems, of, which, the, compact, cassette, commercialized, by, the, philips, electronics, company, in, 1964, is, the, best, known, initially, a, low, fidelity, format, for, spoken, word, voice, recording, and, inadequate, for, music, reproduction, after, a, series, of, improvements, it, entirely, replaced, the, competing, consumer, tape, formats, the, larger, 8, track, tape, used, primarily, in, cars, the, compact, cassette, became, a, major, consumer, audio, format, and, advances, in, electronic, and, mechanical, miniaturization, led, to, the, development, of, the, sony, walkman, a, pocket, sized, cassette, player, introduced, in, 1979, the, walkman, was, the, first, personal, music, player, and, it, gave, a, major, boost, to, sales, of, prerecorded, cassettes, a, key, advance, in, audio, fidelity, came, with, the, dolby, a, noise, reduction, system, invented, by, ray, dolby, and, introduced, into, professional, recording, studios, in, 1966, it, suppressed, the, background, of, hiss, which, was, the, only, easily, audible, downside, of, mastering, on, tape, instead, of, recording, directly, to, disc, a, competing, system, dbx, invented, by, david, blackmer, also, found, success, in, professional, audio, a, simpler, variant, of, dolby, s, noise, reduction, system, known, as, dolby, b, greatly, improved, the, sound, of, cassette, tape, recordings, by, reducing, the, especially, high, level, of, hiss, that, resulted, from, the, cassette, s, miniaturized, tape, format, the, compact, cassette, format, also, benefited, from, improvements, to, the, tape, itself, as, coatings, with, wider, frequency, responses, and, lower, inherent, noise, were, developed, often, based, on, cobalt, and, chrome, oxides, as, the, magnetic, material, instead, of, the, more, usual, iron, oxide, the, multitrack, audio, cartridge, had, been, in, wide, use, in, the, radio, industry, from, the, late, 1950s, to, the, 1980s, but, in, the, 1960s, the, pre, recorded, 8, track, tape, was, launched, as, a, consumer, audio, format, by, the, lear, jet, aircraft, company, aimed, particularly, at, the, automotive, market, they, were, the, first, practical, affordable, car, hi, fi, systems, and, could, produce, sound, quality, superior, to, that, of, the, compact, cassette, the, smaller, size, and, greater, durability, augmented, by, the, ability, to, create, home, recorded, music, mixtapes, since, 8, track, recorders, were, rare, saw, the, cassette, become, the, dominant, consumer, format, for, portable, audio, devices, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, there, had, been, experiments, with, multi, channel, sound, for, many, years, usually, for, special, musical, or, cultural, events, but, the, first, commercial, application, of, the, concept, came, in, the, early, 1970s, with, the, introduction, of, quadraphonic, sound, this, spin, off, development, from, multitrack, recording, used, four, tracks, instead, of, the, two, used, in, stereo, and, four, speakers, to, create, a, 360, degree, audio, field, around, the, listener, following, the, release, of, the, first, consumer, 4, channel, hi, fi, systems, a, number, of, popular, albums, were, released, in, one, of, the, competing, four, channel, formats, among, the, best, known, are, mike, oldfield, s, tubular, bells, and, pink, floyd, s, the, dark, side, of, the, moon, quadraphonic, sound, was, not, a, commercial, success, partly, because, of, competing, and, somewhat, incompatible, four, channel, sound, systems, e, g, cbs, jvc, dynaco, and, others, all, had, systems, and, generally, poor, quality, even, when, played, as, intended, on, the, correct, equipment, of, the, released, music, it, eventually, faded, out, in, the, late, 1970s, although, this, early, venture, paved, the, way, for, the, eventual, introduction, of, domestic, surround, sound, systems, in, home, theatre, use, which, gained, popularity, following, the, introduction, of, the, dvd, the, replacement, of, the, relatively, fragile, vacuum, tube, by, the, smaller, rugged, and, efficient, transistor, also, accelerated, the, sale, of, consumer, high, fidelity, sound, systems, from, the, 1960s, onward, in, the, 1950s, most, record, players, were, monophonic, and, had, relatively, low, sound, quality, few, consumers, could, afford, high, quality, stereophonic, sound, systems, in, the, 1960s, american, manufacturers, introduced, a, new, generation, of, modular, hi, fi, components, separate, turntables, pre, amplifiers, amplifiers, both, combined, as, integrated, amplifiers, tape, recorders, and, other, ancillary, equipment, like, the, graphic, equalizer, which, could, be, connected, together, to, create, a, complete, home, sound, system, these, developments, were, rapidly, taken, up, by, major, japanese, electronics, companies, which, soon, flooded, the, world, market, with, relatively, affordable, high, quality, transistorized, audio, components, by, the, 1980s, corporations, like, sony, had, become, world, leaders, in, the, music, recording, and, playback, industry, the, advent, of, digital, sound, recording, and, later, the, compact, disc, cd, in, 1982, brought, significant, improvements, in, the, quality, and, durability, of, recordings, the, cd, initiated, another, massive, wave, of, change, in, the, consumer, music, industry, with, vinyl, records, effectively, relegated, to, a, small, niche, market, by, the, mid, 1990s, the, record, industry, fiercely, resisted, the, introduction, of, digital, systems, fearing, wholesale, piracy, on, a, medium, able, to, produce, perfect, copies, of, original, released, recordings, the, most, recent, and, revolutionary, developments, have, been, in, digital, recording, with, the, development, of, various, uncompressed, and, compressed, digital, audio, file, formats, processors, capable, and, fast, enough, to, convert, the, digital, data, to, sound, in, real, time, and, inexpensive, mass, storage, this, generated, new, types, of, portable, digital, audio, players, the, minidisc, player, using, atrac, compression, on, small, re, writeable, discs, was, introduced, in, the, 1990s, but, became, obsolescent, as, solid, state, non, volatile, flash, memory, dropped, in, price, as, technologies, that, increase, the, amount, of, data, that, can, be, stored, on, a, single, medium, such, as, super, audio, cd, dvd, a, blu, ray, disc, and, hd, dvd, became, available, longer, programs, of, higher, quality, fit, onto, a, single, disc, sound, files, are, readily, downloaded, from, the, internet, and, other, sources, and, copied, onto, computers, and, digital, audio, players, digital, audio, technology, is, now, used, in, all, areas, of, audio, from, casual, use, of, music, files, of, moderate, quality, to, the, most, demanding, professional, applications, new, applications, such, as, internet, radio, and, podcasting, have, appeared, technological, developments, in, recording, editing, and, consuming, have, transformed, the, record, movie, and, television, industries, in, recent, decades, audio, editing, became, practicable, with, the, invention, of, magnetic, tape, recording, but, technologies, like, midi, sound, synthesis, and, digital, audio, workstations, allow, greater, control, and, efficiency, for, composers, and, artists, digital, audio, techniques, and, mass, storage, have, reduced, recording, costs, such, that, high, quality, recordings, can, be, produced, in, small, studios, today, the, process, of, making, a, recording, is, separated, into, tracking, mixing, and, mastering, multitrack, recording, makes, it, possible, to, capture, signals, from, several, microphones, or, from, different, takes, to, tape, disc, or, mass, storage, allowing, previously, unavailable, flexibility, in, the, mixing, and, mastering, stages, there, are, many, different, digital, audio, recording, and, processing, programs, running, under, several, computer, operating, systems, for, all, purposes, ranging, from, casual, users, and, serious, amateurs, working, on, small, projects, to, professional, sound, engineers, who, are, recording, albums, film, scores, and, doing, sound, design, for, video, games, digital, dictation, software, for, recording, and, transcribing, speech, has, different, requirements, intelligibility, and, flexible, playback, facilities, are, priorities, while, a, wide, frequency, range, and, high, audio, quality, are, not, in, copyright, law, a, phonogram, or, sound, recording,

phonograms, convention, defines, as, the, letter, p, in, a, full, circle, this, usually, accompanies, the, copyright, notice, for, the, underlying, musical, composition, which, uses, the, ordinary, symbol, the, recording, is, separate, from, the, song, so, copyright, for, a, recording, usually, belongs, to, the, record, company, it, is, less, common, for, an, artist, or, producer, to, hold,
