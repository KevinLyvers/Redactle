interferometry, is, a, technique, which, uses, the, interference, of, superimposed, waves, to, extract, information, interferometry, typically, uses, electromagnetic, waves, and, is, an, important, investigative, technique, in, the, fields, of, astronomy, fiber, optics, engineering, metrology, optical, metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy, and, its, applications, to, chemistry, quantum, mechanics, nuclear, and, particle, physics, plasma, physics, biomolecular, interactions, surface, profiling, microfluidics, mechanical, stress, strain, measurement, velocimetry, optometry, and, making, holograms, 1, 2, interferometers, are, devices, that, extract, information, from, interference, they, are, widely, used, in, science, and, industry, for, the, measurement, of, microscopic, displacements, refractive, index, changes, and, surface, irregularities, in, the, case, with, most, interferometers, light, from, a, single, source, is, split, into, two, beams, that, travel, in, different, optical, paths, which, are, then, combined, again, to, produce, interference, two, incoherent, sources, can, also, be, made, to, interfere, under, some, circumstances, the, resulting, interference, fringes, give, information, about, the, difference, in, optical, path, lengths, in, analytical, science, interferometers, are, used, to, measure, lengths, and, the, shape, of, optical, components, with, nanometer, precision, they, are, the, highest, precision, length, measuring, instruments, in, existence, in, fourier, transform, spectroscopy, they, are, used, to, analyze, light, containing, features, of, absorption, or, emission, associated, with, a, substance, or, mixture, an, astronomical, interferometer, consists, of, two, or, more, separate, telescopes, that, combine, their, signals, offering, a, resolution, equivalent, to, that, of, a, telescope, of, diameter, equal, to, the, largest, separation, between, its, individual, elements, interferometry, makes, use, of, the, principle, of, superposition, to, combine, waves, in, a, way, that, will, cause, the, result, of, their, combination, to, have, some, meaningful, property, that, is, diagnostic, of, the, original, state, of, the, waves, this, works, because, when, two, waves, with, the, same, frequency, combine, the, resulting, intensity, pattern, is, determined, by, the, phase, difference, between, the, two, waves, waves, that, are, in, phase, will, undergo, constructive, interference, while, waves, that, are, out, of, phase, will, undergo, destructive, interference, waves, which, are, not, completely, in, phase, nor, completely, out, of, phase, will, have, an, intermediate, intensity, pattern, which, can, be, used, to, determine, their, relative, phase, difference, most, interferometers, use, light, or, some, other, form, of, electromagnetic, wave, 3, 12, typically, see, fig, 1, the, well, known, michelson, configuration, a, single, incoming, beam, of, coherent, light, will, be, split, into, two, identical, beams, by, a, beam, splitter, a, partially, reflecting, mirror, each, of, these, beams, travels, a, different, route, called, a, path, and, they, are, recombined, before, arriving, at, a, detector, the, path, difference, the, difference, in, the, distance, traveled, by, each, beam, creates, a, phase, difference, between, them, it, is, this, introduced, phase, difference, that, creates, the, interference, pattern, between, the, initially, identical, waves, 14, 17, if, a, single, beam, has, been, split, along, two, paths, then, the, phase, difference, is, diagnostic, of, anything, that, changes, the, phase, along, the, paths, this, could, be, a, physical, change, in, the, path, length, itself, or, a, change, in, the, refractive, index, along, the, path, 93, 103, as, seen, in, fig, 2a, and, 2b, the, observer, has, a, direct, view, of, mirror, m, 1, seen, through, the, beam, splitter, and, sees, a, reflected, image, m, 2, of, mirror, m, 2, the, fringes, can, be, interpreted, as, the, result, of, interference, between, light, coming, from, the, two, virtual, images, s, 1, and, s, 2, of, the, original, source, s, the, characteristics, of, the, interference, pattern, depend, on, the, nature, of, the, light, source, and, the, precise, orientation, of, the, mirrors, and, beam, splitter, in, fig, 2a, the, optical, elements, are, oriented, so, that, s, 1, and, s, 2, are, in, line, with, the, observer, and, the, resulting, interference, pattern, consists, of, circles, centered, on, the, normal, to, m, 1, and, m, 2, if, as, in, fig, 2b, m, 1, and, m, 2, are, tilted, with, respect, to, each, other, the, interference, fringes, will, generally, take, the, shape, of, conic, sections, hyperbolas, but, if, m, 1, and, m, 2, overlap, the, fringes, near, the, axis, will, be, straight, parallel, and, equally, spaced, if, s, is, an, extended, source, rather, than, a, point, source, as, illustrated, the, fringes, of, fig, 2a, must, be, observed, with, a, telescope, set, at, infinity, while, the, fringes, of, fig, 2b, will, be, localized, on, the, mirrors, 17, use, of, white, light, will, result, in, a, pattern, of, colored, fringes, see, fig, 3, 26, the, central, fringe, representing, equal, path, length, may, be, light, or, dark, depending, on, the, number, of, phase, inversions, experienced, by, the, two, beams, as, they, traverse, the, optical, system, 26, 171, 172, see, michelson, interferometer, for, a, discussion, of, this, the, law, of, interference, of, light, was, described, by, thomas, young, in, his, 1803, bakerian, lecture, to, the, royal, society, of, london, in, preparation, for, the, lecture, young, performed, a, double, aperture, experiment, that, demonstrated, interference, fringes, his, interpretation, in, terms, of, the, interference, of, waves, was, rejected, by, most, scientists, at, the, time, because, of, the, dominance, of, isaac, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, of, light, proposed, a, century, before, the, french, engineer, augustin, jean, fresnel, unaware, of, young, s, results, began, working, on, a, wave, theory, of, light, and, interference, and, was, introduced, to, francois, arago, between, 1816, and, 1818, fresnel, and, arago, performed, interference, experiments, at, the, paris, observatory, during, this, time, arago, designed, and, built, the, first, interferometer, using, it, to, measure, the, refractive, index, of, moist, air, relative, to, dry, air, which, posed, a, potential, problem, for, astronomical, observations, of, star, positions, the, success, of, fresnel, s, wave, theory, of, light, was, established, in, his, prize, winning, memoire, of, 1819, that, predicted, and, measured, diffraction, patterns, the, arago, interferometer, was, later, employed, in, 1850, by, leon, foucault, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, in, air, relative, to, water, and, it, was, used, again, in, 1851, by, hippolyte, fizeau, to, measure, the, effect, of, fresnel, drag, on, the, speed, of, light, in, moving, water, jules, jamin, developed, the, first, single, beam, interferometer, not, requiring, a, splitting, aperture, as, the, arago, interferometer, did, in, 1856, in, 1881, the, american, physicist, albert, a, michelson, while, visiting, hermann, von, helmholtz, in, berlin, invented, the, interferometer, that, is, named, after, him, the, michelson, interferometer, to, search, for, effects, of, the, motion, of, the, earth, on, the, speed, of, light, michelson, s, null, results, performed, in, the, basement, of, the, potsdam, observatory, outside, of, berlin, the, horse, traffic, in, the, center, of, berlin, created, too, many, vibrations, and, his, later, more, accurate, null, results, observed, with, edward, w, morley, at, case, college, in, cleveland, ohio, contributed, to, the, growing, crisis, of, the, luminiferous, ether, einstein, stated, that, it, was, fizeau, s, measurement, of, the, speed, of, light, in, moving, water, using, the, arago, interferometer, that, inspired, his, theory, of, the, relativistic, addition, of, velocities, interferometers, and, interferometric, techniques, may, be, categorized, by, a, variety, of, criteria, in, homodyne, detection, the, interference, occurs, between, two, beams, at, the, same, wavelength, or, carrier, frequency, the, phase, difference, between, the, two, beams, results, in, a, change, in, the, intensity, of, the, light, on, the, detector, the, resulting, intensity, of, the, light, after, mixing, of, these, two, beams, is, measured, or, the, pattern, of, interference, fringes, is, viewed, or, recorded, most, of, the, interferometers, discussed, in, this, article, fall, into, this, category, the, heterodyne, technique, is, used, for, 1, shifting, an, input, signal, into, a, new, frequency, range, as, well, as, 2, amplifying, a, weak, input, signal, assuming, use, of, an, active, mixer, a, weak, input, signal, of, frequency, f, 1, is, mixed, with, a, strong, reference, frequency, f, 2, from, a, local, oscillator, lo, the, nonlinear, combination, of, the, input, signals, creates, two, new, signals, one, at, the, sum, f, 1, f, 2, of, the, two, frequencies, and, the, other, at, the, difference, f, 1, f, 2, these, new, frequencies, are, called, heterodynes, typically, only, one, of, the, new, frequencies, is, desired, and, the, other, signal, is, filtered, out, of, the, output, of, the, mixer, the, output, signal, will, have, an, intensity, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, amplitudes, of, the, input, signals, the, most, important, and, widely, used, application, of, the, heterodyne, technique, is, in, the, superheterodyne, receiver, superhet, invented, in, 1917, 18, by, u, s, engineer, edwin, howard, armstrong, and, french, engineer, lucien, l, vy, in, this, circuit, the, incoming, radio, frequency, signal, from, the, antenna, is, mixed, with, a, signal, from, a, local, oscillator, lo, and, converted, by, the, heterodyne, technique, to, a, lower, fixed, frequency, signal, called, the, intermediate, frequency, if, this, if, is, amplified, and, filtered, before, being, applied, to, a, detector, which, extracts, the, audio, signal, which, is, sent, to, the, loudspeaker, optical, heterodyne, detection, is, an, extension, of, the, heterodyne, technique, to, higher, visible, frequencies, while, optical, heterodyne, interferometry, is, usually, done, at, a, single, point, it, is, also, possible, to, perform, this, widefield, a, double, path, interferometer, is, one, in, which, the, reference, beam, and, sample, beam, travel, along, divergent, paths, examples, include, the, michelson, interferometer, the, twyman, green, interferometer, and, the, mach, zehnder, interferometer, after, being, perturbed, by, interaction, with, the, sample, under, test, the, sample, beam, is, recombined, with, the, reference, beam, to, create, an, interference, pattern, which, can, then, be, interpreted, 13, 22, a, common, path, interferometer, is, a, class, of, interferometer, in, which, the, reference, beam, and, sample, beam, travel, along, the, same, path, fig, 4, illustrates, the, sagnac, interferometer, the, fibre, optic, gyroscope, the, point, diffraction, interferometer, and, the, lateral, shearing, interferometer, other, examples, of, common, path, interferometer, include, the, zernike, phase, contrast, microscope, fresnel, s, biprism, the, zero, area, sagnac, and, the, scatterplate, interferometer, a, wavefront, splitting, interferometer, divides, a, light, wavefront, emerging, from, a, point, or, a, narrow, slit, i, e, spatially, coherent, light, and, after, allowing, the, two, parts, of, the, wavefront, to, travel, through, different, paths, allows, them, to, recombine, fig, 5, illustrates, young, s, interference, experiment, and, lloyd, s, mirror, other, examples, of, wavefront, splitting, interferometer, include, the, fresnel, biprism, the, billet, bi, lens, diffraction, grating, michelson, interferometer, and, the, rayleigh, interferometer, in, 1803, young, s, interference, experiment, played, a, major, role, in, the, general, acceptance, of, the, wave, theory, of, light, if, white, light, is, used, in, young, s, experiment, the, result, is, a, white, central, band, of, constructive, interference, corresponding, to, equal, path, length, from, the, two, slits, surrounded, by, a, symmetrical, pattern, of, colored, fringes, of, diminishing, intensity, in, addition, to, continuous, electromagnetic, radiation, young, s, experiment, has, been, performed, with, individual, photons, with, electrons, and, with, buckyball, molecules, large, enough, to, be, seen, under, an, electron, microscope, lloyd, s, mirror, generates, interference, fringes, by, combining, direct, light, from, a, source, blue, lines, and, light, from, the, source, s, reflected, image, red, lines, from, a, mirror, held, at, grazing, incidence, the, result, is, an, asymmetrical, pattern, of, fringes, the, band, of, equal, path, length, nearest, the, mirror, is, dark, rather, than, bright, in, 1834, humphrey, lloyd, interpreted, this, effect, as, proof, that, the, phase, of, a, front, surface, reflected, beam, is, inverted, an, amplitude, splitting, interferometer, uses, a, partial, reflector, to, divide, the, amplitude, of, the, incident, wave, into, separate, beams, which, are, separated, and, recombined, the, fizeau, interferometer, is, shown, as, it, might, be, set, up, to, test, an, optical, flat, a, precisely, figured, reference, flat, is, placed, on, top, of, the, flat, being, tested, separated, by, narrow, spacers, the, reference, flat, is, slightly, beveled, only, a, fraction, of, a, degree, of, beveling, is, necessary, to, prevent, the, rear, surface, of, the, flat, from, producing, interference, fringes, separating, the, test, and, reference, flats, allows, the, two, flats, to, be, tilted, with, respect, to, each, other, by, adjusting, the, tilt, which, adds, a, controlled, phase, gradient, to, the, fringe, pattern, one, can, control, the, spacing, and, direction, of, the, fringes, so, that, one, may, obtain, an, easily, interpreted, series, of, nearly, parallel, fringes, rather, than, a, complex, swirl, of, contour, lines, separating, the, plates, however, necessitates, that, the, illuminating, light, be, collimated, fig, 6, shows, a, collimated, beam, of, monochromatic, light, illuminating, the, two, flats, and, a, beam, splitter, allowing, the, fringes, to, be, viewed, on, axis, the, mach, zehnder, interferometer, is, a, more, versatile, instrument, than, the, michelson, interferometer, each, of, the, well, separated, light, paths, is, traversed, only, once, and, the, fringes, can, be, adjusted, so, that, they, are, localized, in, any, desired, plane, 18, typically, the, fringes, would, be, adjusted, to, lie, in, the, same, plane, as, the, test, object, so, that, fringes, and, test, object, can, be, photographed, together, if, it, is, decided, to, produce, fringes, in, white, light, then, since, white, light, has, a, limited, coherence, length, on, the, order, of, micrometers, great, care, must, be, taken, to, equalize, the, optical, paths, or, no, fringes, will, be, visible, as, illustrated, in, fig, 6, a, compensating, cell, would, be, placed, in, the, path, of, the, reference, beam, to, match, the, test, cell, note, also, the, precise, orientation, of, the, beam, splitters, the, reflecting, surfaces, of, the, beam, splitters, would, be, oriented, so, that, the, test, and, reference, beams, pass, through, an, equal, amount, of, glass, in, this, orientation, the, test, and, reference, beams, each, experience, two, front, surface, reflections, resulting, in, the, same, number, of, phase, inversions, the, result, is, that, light, traveling, an, equal, optical, path, length, in, the, test, and, reference, beams, produces, a, white, light, fringe, of, constructive, interference, the, heart, of, the, fabry, p, rot, interferometer, is, a, pair, of, partially, silvered, glass, optical, flats, spaced, several, millimeters, to, centimeters, apart, with, the, silvered, surfaces, facing, each, other, alternatively, a, fabry, p, rot, etalon, uses, a, transparent, plate, with, two, parallel, reflecting, surfaces, 35, 36, as, with, the, fizeau, interferometer, the, flats, are, slightly, beveled, in, a, typical, system, illumination, is, provided, by, a, diffuse, source, set, at, the, focal, plane, of, a, collimating, lens, a, focusing, lens, produces, what, would, be, an, inverted, image, of, the, source, if, the, paired, flats, were, not, present, i, e, in, the, absence, of, the, paired, flats, all, light, emitted, from, point, a, passing, through, the, optical, system, would, be, focused, at, point, a, in, fig, 6, only, one, ray, emitted, from, point, a, on, the, source, is, traced, as, the, ray, passes, through, the, paired, flats, it, is, multiply, reflected, to, produce, multiple, transmitted, rays, which, are, collected, by, the, focusing, lens, and, brought, to, point, a, on, the, screen, the, complete, interference, pattern, takes, the, appearance, of, a, set, of, concentric, rings, the, sharpness, of, the, rings, depends, on, the, reflectivity, of, the, flats, if, the, reflectivity, is, high, resulting, in, a, high, q, factor, i, e, high, finesse, monochromatic, light, produces, a, set, of, narrow, bright, rings, against, a, dark, background, in, fig, 6, the, low, finesse, image, corresponds, to, a, reflectivity, of, 0, 04, i, e, unsilvered, surfaces, versus, a, reflectivity, of, 0, 95, for, the, high, finesse, image, fig, 6, illustrates, the, fizeau, mach, zehnder, and, fabry, p, rot, interferometers, other, examples, of, amplitude, splitting, interferometer, include, the, michelson, twyman, green, laser, unequal, path, and, linnik, interferometer, michelson, and, morley, 1887, and, other, early, experimentalists, using, interferometric, techniques, in, an, attempt, to, measure, the, properties, of, the, luminiferous, aether, used, monochromatic, light, only, for, initially, setting, up, their, equipment, always, switching, to, white, light, for, the, actual, measurements, the, reason, is, that, measurements, were, recorded, visually, monochromatic, light, would, result, in, a, uniform, fringe, pattern, lacking, modern, means, of, environmental, temperature, control, experimentalists, struggled, with, continual, fringe, drift, even, though, the, interferometer, might, be, set, up, in, a, basement, since, the, fringes, would, occasionally, disappear, due, to, vibrations, by, passing, horse, traffic, distant, thunderstorms, and, the, like, it, would, be, easy, for, an, observer, to, get, lost, when, the, fringes, returned, to, visibility, the, advantages, of, white, light, which, produced, a, distinctive, colored, fringe, pattern, far, outweighed, the, difficulties, of, aligning, the, apparatus, due, to, its, low, coherence, length, this, was, an, early, example, of, the, use, of, white, light, to, resolve, the, 2, pi, ambiguity, in, physics, one, of, the, most, important, experiments, of, the, late, 19th, century, was, the, famous, failed, experiment, of, michelson, and, morley, which, provided, evidence, for, special, relativity, recent, repetitions, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, perform, heterodyne, measurements, of, beat, frequencies, of, crossed, cryogenic, optical, resonators, fig, 7, illustrates, a, resonator, experiment, performed, by, m, ller, et, al, in, 2003, two, optical, resonators, constructed, from, crystalline, sapphire, controlling, the, frequencies, of, two, lasers, were, set, at, right, angles, within, a, helium, cryostat, a, frequency, comparator, measured, the, beat, frequency, of, the, combined, outputs, of, the, two, resonators, as, of, 2009, the, precision, by, which, anisotropy, of, the, speed, of, light, can, be, excluded, in, resonator, experiments, is, at, the, 10, 17, level, michelson, interferometers, are, used, in, tunable, narrow, band, optical, filters, and, as, the, core, hardware, component, of, fourier, transform, spectrometers, when, used, as, a, tunable, narrow, band, filter, michelson, interferometers, exhibit, a, number, of, advantages, and, disadvantages, when, compared, with, competing, technologies, such, as, fabry, p, rot, interferometers, or, lyot, filters, michelson, interferometers, have, the, largest, field, of, view, for, a, specified, wavelength, and, are, relatively, simple, in, operation, since, tuning, is, via, mechanical, rotation, of, waveplates, rather, than, via, high, voltage, control, of, piezoelectric, crystals, or, lithium, niobate, optical, modulators, as, used, in, a, fabry, p, rot, system, compared, with, lyot, filters, which, use, birefringent, elements, michelson, interferometers, have, a, relatively, low, temperature, sensitivity, on, the, negative, side, michelson, interferometers, have, a, relatively, restricted, wavelength, range, and, require, use, of, prefilters, which, restrict, transmittance, fig, 8, illustrates, the, operation, of, a, fourier, transform, spectrometer, which, is, essentially, a, michelson, interferometer, with, one, mirror, movable, a, practical, fourier, transform, spectrometer, would, substitute, corner, cube, reflectors, for, the, flat, mirrors, of, the, conventional, michelson, interferometer, but, for, simplicity, the, illustration, does, not, show, this, an, interferogram, is, generated, by, making, measurements, of, the, signal, at, many, discrete, positions, of, the, moving, mirror, a, fourier, transform, converts, the, interferogram, into, an, actual, spectrum, fig, 9, shows, a, doppler, image, of, the, solar, corona, made, using, a, tunable, fabry, p, rot, interferometer, to, recover, scans, of, the, solar, corona, at, a, number, of, wavelengths, near, the, fexiv, green, line, the, picture, is, a, color, coded, image, of, the, doppler, shift, of, the, line, which, may, be, associated, with, the, coronal, plasma, velocity, towards, or, away, from, the, satellite, camera, fabry, p, rot, thin, film, etalons, are, used, in, narrow, bandpass, filters, capable, of, selecting, a, single, spectral, line, for, imaging, for, example, the, h, alpha, line, or, the, ca, k, line, of, the, sun, or, stars, fig, 10, shows, an, extreme, ultraviolet, imaging, telescope, eit, image, of, the, sun, at, 195, ngstr, ms, 19, 5, nm, corresponding, to, a, spectral, line, of, multiply, ionized, iron, atoms, eit, used, multilayer, coated, reflective, mirrors, that, were, coated, with, alternate, layers, of, a, light, spacer, element, such, as, silicon, and, a, heavy, scatterer, element, such, as, molybdenum, approximately, 100, layers, of, each, type, were, placed, on, each, mirror, with, a, thickness, of, around, 10, nm, each, the, layer, thicknesses, were, tightly, controlled, so, that, at, the, desired, wavelength, reflected, photons, from, each, layer, interfered, constructively, the, laser, interferometer, gravitational, wave, observatory, ligo, uses, two, 4, km, michelson, fabry, p, rot, interferometers, for, the, detection, of, gravitational, waves, in, this, application, the, fabry, p, rot, cavity, is, used, to, store, photons, for, almost, a, millisecond, while, they, bounce, up, and, down, between, the, mirrors, this, increases, the, time, a, gravitational, wave, can, interact, with, the, light, which, results, in, a, better, sensitivity, at, low, frequencies, smaller, cavities, usually, called, mode, cleaners, are, used, for, spatial, filtering, and, frequency, stabilization, of, the, main, laser, the, first, observation, of, gravitational, waves, occurred, on, september, 14, 2015, the, mach, zehnder, interferometer, s, relatively, large, and, freely, accessible, working, space, and, its, flexibility, in, locating, the, fringes, has, made, it, the, interferometer, of, choice, for, visualizing, flow, in, wind, tunnels, and, for, flow, visualization, studies, in, general, it, is, frequently, used, in, the, fields, of, aerodynamics, plasma, physics, and, heat, transfer, to, measure, pressure, density, and, temperature, changes, in, gases, 18, 93, 95, mach, zehnder, interferometers, are, also, used, to, study, one, of, the, most, counterintuitive, predictions, of, quantum, mechanics, the, phenomenon, known, as, quantum, entanglement, an, astronomical, interferometer, achieves, high, resolution, observations, using, the, technique, of, aperture, synthesis, mixing, signals, from, a, cluster, of, comparatively, small, telescopes, rather, than, a, single, very, expensive, monolithic, telescope, early, radio, telescope, interferometers, used, a, single, baseline, for, measurement, later, astronomical, interferometers, such, as, the, very, large, array, illustrated, in, fig, 11, used, arrays, of, telescopes, arranged, in, a, pattern, on, the, ground, a, limited, number, of, baselines, will, result, in, insufficient, coverage, this, was, alleviated, by, using, the, rotation, of, the, earth, to, rotate, the, array, relative, to, the, sky, thus, a, single, baseline, could, measure, information, in, multiple, orientations, by, taking, repeated, measurements, a, technique, called, earth, rotation, synthesis, baselines, thousands, of, kilometers, long, were, achieved, using, very, long, baseline, interferometry, astronomical, optical, interferometry, has, had, to, overcome, a, number, of, technical, issues, not, shared, by, radio, telescope, interferometry, the, short, wavelengths, of, light, necessitate, extreme, precision, and, stability, of, construction, for, example, spatial, resolution, of, 1, milliarcsecond, requires, 0, 5, m, stability, in, a, 100, m, baseline, optical, interferometric, measurements, require, high, sensitivity, low, noise, detectors, that, did, not, become, available, until, the, late, 1990s, astronomical, seeing, the, turbulence, that, causes, stars, to, twinkle, introduces, rapid, random, phase, changes, in, the, incoming, light, requiring, data, collection, rates, to, be, faster, than, the, rate, of, turbulence, despite, these, technical, difficulties, three, major, facilities, are, now, in, operation, offering, resolutions, down, to, the, fractional, milliarcsecond, range, this, linked, video, shows, a, movie, assembled, from, aperture, synthesis, images, of, the, beta, lyrae, system, a, binary, star, system, approximately, 960, light, years, 290, parsecs, away, in, the, constellation, lyra, as, observed, by, the, chara, array, with, the, mirc, instrument, the, brighter, component, is, the, primary, star, or, the, mass, donor, the, fainter, component, is, the, thick, disk, surrounding, the, secondary, star, or, the, mass, gainer, the, two, components, are, separated, by, 1, milli, arcsecond, tidal, distortions, of, the, mass, donor, and, the, mass, gainer, are, both, clearly, visible, the, wave, character, of, matter, can, be, exploited, to, build, interferometers, the, first, examples, of, matter, interferometers, were, electron, interferometers, later, followed, by, neutron, interferometers, around, 1990, the, first, atom, interferometers, were, demonstrated, later, followed, by, interferometers, employing, molecules, electron, holography, is, an, imaging, technique, that, photographically, records, the, electron, interference, pattern, of, an, object, which, is, then, reconstructed, to, yield, a, greatly, magnified, image, of, the, original, object, this, technique, was, developed, to, enable, greater, resolution, in, electron, microscopy, than, is, possible, using, conventional, imaging, techniques, the, resolution, of, conventional, electron, microscopy, is, not, limited, by, electron, wavelength, but, by, the, large, aberrations, of, electron, lenses, neutron, interferometry, has, been, used, to, investigate, the, aharonov, bohm, effect, to, examine, the, effects, of, gravity, acting, on, an, elementary, particle, and, to, demonstrate, a, strange, behavior, of, fermions, that, is, at, the, basis, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, unlike, macroscopic, objects, when, fermions, are, rotated, by, 360, about, any, axis, they, do, not, return, to, their, original, state, but, develop, a, minus, sign, in, their, wave, function, in, other, words, a, fermion, needs, to, be, rotated, 720, before, returning, to, its, original, state, atom, interferometry, techniques, are, reaching, sufficient, precision, to, allow, laboratory, scale, tests, of, general, relativity, interferometers, are, used, in, atmospheric, physics, for, high, precision, measurements, of, trace, gases, via, remote, sounding, of, the, atmosphere, there, are, several, examples, of, interferometers, that, utilize, either, absorption, or, emission, features, of, trace, gases, a, typical, use, would, be, in, continual, monitoring, of, the, column, concentration, of, trace, gases, such, as, ozone, and, carbon, monoxide, above, the, instrument, newton, test, plate, interferometry, is, frequently, used, in, the, optical, industry, for, testing, the, quality, of, surfaces, as, they, are, being, shaped, and, figured, fig, 13, shows, photos, of, reference, flats, being, used, to, check, two, test, flats, at, different, stages, of, completion, showing, the, different, patterns, of, interference, fringes, the, reference, flats, are, resting, with, their, bottom, surfaces, in, contact, with, the, test, flats, and, they, are, illuminated, by, a, monochromatic, light, source, the, light, waves, reflected, from, both, surfaces, interfere, resulting, in, a, pattern, of, bright, and, dark, bands, the, surface, in, the, left, photo, is, nearly, flat, indicated, by, a, pattern, of, straight, parallel, interference, fringes, at, equal, intervals, the, surface, in, the, right, photo, is, uneven, resulting, in, a, pattern, of, curved, fringes, each, pair, of, adjacent, fringes, represents, a, difference, in, surface, elevation, of, half, a, wavelength, of, the, light, used, so, differences, in, elevation, can, be, measured, by, counting, the, fringes, the, flatness, of, the, surfaces, can, be, measured, to, millionths, of, an, inch, by, this, method, to, determine, whether, the, surface, being, tested, is, concave, or, convex, with, respect, to, the, reference, optical, flat, any, of, several, procedures, may, be, adopted, one, can, observe, how, the, fringes, are, displaced, when, one, presses, gently, on, the, top, flat, if, one, observes, the, fringes, in, white, light, the, sequence, of, colors, becomes, familiar, with, experience, and, aids, in, interpretation, finally, one, may, compare, the, appearance, of, the, fringes, as, one, moves, ones, head, from, a, normal, to, an, oblique, viewing, position, these, sorts, of, maneuvers, while, common, in, the, optical, shop, are, not, suitable, in, a, formal, testing, environment, when, the, flats, are, ready, for, sale, they, will, typically, be, mounted, in, a, fizeau, interferometer, for, formal, testing, and, certification, fabry, p, rot, etalons, are, widely, used, in, telecommunications, lasers, and, spectroscopy, to, control, and, measure, the, wavelengths, of, light, dichroic, filters, are, multiple, layer, thin, film, etalons, in, telecommunications, wavelength, division, multiplexing, the, technology, that, enables, the, use, of, multiple, wavelengths, of, light, through, a, single, optical, fiber, depends, on, filtering, devices, that, are, thin, film, etalons, single, mode, lasers, employ, etalons, to, suppress, all, optical, cavity, modes, except, the, single, one, of, interest, 42, the, twyman, green, interferometer, invented, by, twyman, and, green, in, 1916, is, a, variant, of, the, michelson, interferometer, widely, used, to, test, optical, components, the, basic, characteristics, distinguishing, it, from, the, michelson, configuration, are, the, use, of, a, monochromatic, point, light, source, and, a, collimator, michelson, 1918, criticized, the, twyman, green, configuration, as, being, unsuitable, for, the, testing, of, large, optical, components, since, the, light, sources, available, at, the, time, had, limited, coherence, length, michelson, pointed, out, that, constraints, on, geometry, forced, by, limited, coherence, length, required, the, use, of, a, reference, mirror, of, equal, size, to, the, test, mirror, making, the, twyman, green, impractical, for, many, purposes, decades, later, the, advent, of, laser, light, sources, answered, michelson, s, objections, a, twyman, green, interferometer, using, a, laser, light, source, and, unequal, path, length, is, known, as, a, laser, unequal, path, interferometer, or, lupi, fig, 14, illustrates, a, twyman, green, interferometer, set, up, to, test, a, lens, light, from, a, monochromatic, point, source, is, expanded, by, a, diverging, lens, not, shown, then, is, collimated, into, a, parallel, beam, a, convex, spherical, mirror, is, positioned, so, that, its, center, of, curvature, coincides, with, the, focus, of, the, lens, being, tested, the, emergent, beam, is, recorded, by, an, imaging, system, for, analysis, mach, zehnder, interferometers, are, being, used, in, integrated, optical, circuits, in, which, light, interferes, between, two, branches, of, a, waveguide, that, are, externally, modulated, to, vary, their, relative, phase, a, slight, tilt, of, one, of, the, beam, splitters, will, result, in, a, path, difference, and, a, change, in, the, interference, pattern, mach, zehnder, interferometers, are, the, basis, of, a, wide, variety, of, devices, from, rf, modulators, to, sensors, to, optical, switches, the, latest, proposed, extremely, large, astronomical, telescopes, such, as, the, thirty, meter, telescope, and, the, extremely, large, telescope, will, be, of, segmented, design, their, primary, mirrors, will, be, built, from, hundreds, of, hexagonal, mirror, segments, polishing, and, figuring, these, highly, aspheric, and, non, rotationally, symmetric, mirror, segments, presents, a, major, challenge, traditional, means, of, optical, testing, compares, a, surface, against, a, spherical, reference, with, the, aid, of, a, null, corrector, in, recent, years, computer, generated, holograms, cghs, have, begun, to, supplement, null, correctors, in, test, setups, for, complex, aspheric, surfaces, fig, 15, illustrates, how, this, is, done, unlike, the, figure, actual, cghs, have, line, spacing, on, the, order, of, 1, to, 10, m, when, laser, light, is, passed, through, the, cgh, the, zero, order, diffracted, beam, experiences, no, wavefront, modification, the, wavefront, of, the, first, order, diffracted, beam, however, is, modified, to, match, the, desired, shape, of, the, test, surface, in, the, illustrated, fizeau, interferometer, test, setup, the, zero, order, diffracted, beam, is, directed, towards, the, spherical, reference, surface, and, the, first, order, diffracted, beam, is, directed, towards, the, test, surface, in, such, a, way, that, the, two, reflected, beams, combine, to, form, interference, fringes, the, same, test, setup, can, be, used, for, the, innermost, mirrors, as, for, the, outermost, with, only, the, cgh, needing, to, be, exchanged, ring, laser, gyroscopes, rlgs, and, fibre, optic, gyroscopes, fogs, are, interferometers, used, in, navigation, systems, they, operate, on, the, principle, of, the, sagnac, effect, the, distinction, between, rlgs, and, fogs, is, that, in, a, rlg, the, entire, ring, is, part, of, the, laser, while, in, a, fog, an, external, laser, injects, counter, propagating, beams, into, an, optical, fiber, ring, and, rotation, of, the, system, then, causes, a, relative, phase, shift, between, those, beams, in, a, rlg, the, observed, phase, shift, is, proportional, to, the, accumulated, rotation, while, in, a, fog, the, observed, phase, shift, is, proportional, to, the, angular, velocity, in, telecommunication, networks, heterodyning, is, used, to, move, frequencies, of, individual, signals, to, different, channels, which, may, share, a, single, physical, transmission, line, this, is, called, frequency, division, multiplexing, fdm, for, example, a, coaxial, cable, used, by, a, cable, television, system, can, carry, 500, television, channels, at, the, same, time, because, each, one, is, given, a, different, frequency, so, they, don, t, interfere, with, one, another, continuous, wave, cw, doppler, radar, detectors, are, basically, heterodyne, detection, devices, that, compare, transmitted, and, reflected, beams, optical, heterodyne, detection, is, used, for, coherent, doppler, lidar, measurements, capable, of, detecting, very, weak, light, scattered, in, the, atmosphere, and, monitoring, wind, speeds, with, high, accuracy, it, has, application, in, optical, fiber, communications, in, various, high, resolution, spectroscopic, techniques, and, the, self, heterodyne, method, can, be, used, to, measure, the, linewidth, of, a, laser, optical, heterodyne, detection, is, an, essential, technique, used, in, high, accuracy, measurements, of, the, frequencies, of, optical, sources, as, well, as, in, the, stabilization, of, their, frequencies, until, a, relatively, few, years, ago, lengthy, frequency, chains, were, needed, to, connect, the, microwave, frequency, of, a, cesium, or, other, atomic, time, source, to, optical, frequencies, at, each, step, of, the, chain, a, frequency, multiplier, would, be, used, to, produce, a, harmonic, of, the, frequency, of, that, step, which, would, be, compared, by, heterodyne, detection, with, the, next, step, the, output, of, a, microwave, source, far, infrared, laser, infrared, laser, or, visible, laser, each, measurement, of, a, single, spectral, line, required, several, years, of, effort, in, the, construction, of, a, custom, frequency, chain, currently, optical, frequency, combs, have, provided, a, much, simpler, method, of, measuring, optical, frequencies, if, a, mode, locked, laser, is, modulated, to, form, a, train, of, pulses, its, spectrum, is, seen, to, consist, of, the, carrier, frequency, surrounded, by, a, closely, spaced, comb, of, optical, sideband, frequencies, with, a, spacing, equal, to, the, pulse, repetition, frequency, fig, 16, the, pulse, repetition, frequency, is, locked, to, that, of, the, frequency, standard, and, the, frequencies, of, the, comb, elements, at, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, are, doubled, and, heterodyned, with, the, frequencies, of, the, comb, elements, at, the, blue, end, of, the, spectrum, thus, allowing, the, comb, to, serve, as, its, own, reference, in, this, manner, locking, of, the, frequency, comb, output, to, an, atomic, standard, can, be, performed, in, a, single, step, to, measure, an, unknown, frequency, the, frequency, comb, output, is, dispersed, into, a, spectrum, the, unknown, frequency, is, overlapped, with, the, appropriate, spectral, segment, of, the, comb, and, the, frequency, of, the, resultant, heterodyne, beats, is, measured, one, of, the, most, common, industrial, applications, of, optical, interferometry, is, as, a, versatile, measurement, tool, for, the, high, precision, examination, of, surface, topography, popular, interferometric, measurement, techniques, include, phase, shifting, interferometry, psi, and, vertical, scanning, interferometry, vsi, also, known, as, scanning, white, light, interferometry, swli, or, by, the, iso, term, coherence, scanning, interferometry, csi, csi, exploits, coherence, to, extend, the, range, of, capabilities, for, interference, microscopy, these, techniques, are, widely, used, in, micro, electronic, and, micro, optic, fabrication, psi, uses, monochromatic, light, and, provides, very, precise, measurements, however, it, is, only, usable, for, surfaces, that, are, very, smooth, csi, often, uses, white, light, and, high, numerical, apertures, and, rather, than, looking, at, the, phase, of, the, fringes, as, does, psi, looks, for, best, position, of, maximum, fringe, contrast, or, some, other, feature, of, the, overall, fringe, pattern, in, its, simplest, form, csi, provides, less, precise, measurements, than, psi, but, can, be, used, on, rough, surfaces, some, configurations, of, csi, variously, known, as, enhanced, vsi, evsi, high, resolution, swli, or, frequency, domain, analysis, fda, use, coherence, effects, in, combination, with, interference, phase, to, enhance, precision, phase, shifting, interferometry, addresses, several, issues, associated, with, the, classical, analysis, of, static, interferograms, classically, one, measures, the, positions, of, the, fringe, centers, as, seen, in, fig, 13, fringe, deviations, from, straightness, and, equal, spacing, provide, a, measure, of, the, aberration, errors, in, determining, the, location, of, the, fringe, centers, provide, the, inherent, limit, to, precision, of, the, classical, analysis, and, any, intensity, variations, across, the, interferogram, will, also, introduce, error, there, is, a, trade, off, between, precision, and, number, of, data, points, closely, spaced, fringes, provide, many, data, points, of, low, precision, while, widely, spaced, fringes, provide, a, low, number, of, high, precision, data, points, since, fringe, center, data, is, all, that, one, uses, in, the, classical, analysis, all, of, the, other, information, that, might, theoretically, be, obtained, by, detailed, analysis, of, the, intensity, variations, in, an, interferogram, is, thrown, away, finally, with, static, interferograms, additional, information, is, needed, to, determine, the, polarity, of, the, wavefront, in, fig, 13, one, can, see, that, the, tested, surface, on, the, right, deviates, from, flatness, but, one, cannot, tell, from, this, single, image, whether, this, deviation, from, flatness, is, concave, or, convex, traditionally, this, information, would, be, obtained, using, non, automated, means, such, as, by, observing, the, direction, that, the, fringes, move, when, the, reference, surface, is, pushed, phase, shifting, interferometry, overcomes, these, limitations, by, not, relying, on, finding, fringe, centers, but, rather, by, collecting, intensity, data, from, every, point, of, the, ccd, image, sensor, as, seen, in, fig, 17, multiple, interferograms, at, least, three, are, analyzed, with, the, reference, optical, surface, shifted, by, a, precise, fraction, of, a, wavelength, between, each, exposure, using, a, piezoelectric, transducer, pzt, alternatively, precise, phase, shifts, can, be, introduced, by, modulating, the, laser, frequency, the, captured, images, are, processed, by, a, computer, to, calculate, the, optical, wavefront, errors, the, precision, and, reproducibility, of, psi, is, far, greater, than, possible, in, static, interferogram, analysis, with, measurement, repeatabilities, of, a, hundredth, of, a, wavelength, being, routine, phase, shifting, technology, has, been, adapted, to, a, variety, of, interferometer, types, such, as, twyman, green, mach, zehnder, laser, fizeau, and, even, common, path, configurations, such, as, point, diffraction, and, lateral, shearing, interferometers, more, generally, phase, shifting, techniques, can, be, adapted, to, almost, any, system, that, uses, fringes, for, measurement, such, as, holographic, and, speckle, interferometry, in, coherence, scanning, interferometry, interference, is, only, achieved, when, the, path, length, delays, of, the, interferometer, are, matched, within, the, coherence, time, of, the, light, source, csi, monitors, the, fringe, contrast, rather, than, the, phase, of, the, fringes, 105, fig, 17, illustrates, a, csi, microscope, using, a, mirau, interferometer, in, the, objective, other, forms, of, interferometer, used, with, white, light, include, the, michelson, interferometer, for, low, magnification, objectives, where, the, reference, mirror, in, a, mirau, objective, would, interrupt, too, much, of, the, aperture, and, the, linnik, interferometer, for, high, magnification, objectives, with, limited, working, distance, the, sample, or, alternatively, the, objective, is, moved, vertically, over, the, full, height, range, of, the, sample, and, the, position, of, maximum, fringe, contrast, is, found, for, each, pixel, the, chief, benefit, of, coherence, scanning, interferometry, is, that, systems, can, be, designed, that, do, not, suffer, from, the, 2, pi, ambiguity, of, coherent, interferometry, and, as, seen, in, fig, 18, which, scans, a, 180, m, x, 140, m, x, 10, m, volume, it, is, well, suited, to, profiling, steps, and, rough, surfaces, the, axial, resolution, of, the, system, is, determined, in, part, by, the, coherence, length, of, the, light, source, industrial, applications, include, in, process, surface, metrology, roughness, measurement, 3d, surface, metrology, in, hard, to, reach, spaces, and, in, hostile, environments, profilometry, of, surfaces, with, high, aspect, ratio, features, grooves, channels, holes, and, film, thickness, measurement, semi, conductor, and, optical, industries, etc, fig, 19, illustrates, a, twyman, green, interferometer, set, up, for, white, light, scanning, of, a, macroscopic, object, holographic, interferometry, is, a, technique, which, uses, holography, to, monitor, small, deformations, in, single, wavelength, implementations, in, multi, wavelength, implementations, it, is, used, to, perform, dimensional, metrology, of, large, parts, and, assemblies, and, to, detect, larger, surface, defects, 111, 120, holographic, interferometry, was, discovered, by, accident, as, a, result, of, mistakes, committed, during, the, making, of, holograms, early, lasers, were, relatively, weak, and, photographic, plates, were, insensitive, necessitating, long, exposures, during, which, vibrations, or, minute, shifts, might, occur, in, the, optical, system, the, resultant, holograms, which, showed, the, holographic, subject, covered, with, fringes, were, considered, ruined, eventually, several, independent, groups, of, experimenters, in, the, mid, 60s, realized, that, the, fringes, encoded, important, information, about, dimensional, changes, occurring, in, the, subject, and, began, intentionally, producing, holographic, double, exposures, the, main, holographic, interferometry, article, covers, the, disputes, over, priority, of, discovery, that, occurred, during, the, issuance, of, the, patent, for, this, method, double, and, multi, exposure, holography, is, one, of, three, methods, used, to, create, holographic, interferograms, a, first, exposure, records, the, object, in, an, unstressed, state, subsequent, exposures, on, the, same, photographic, plate, are, made, while, the, object, is, subjected, to, some, stress, the, composite, image, depicts, the, difference, between, the, stressed, and, unstressed, states, real, time, holography, is, a, second, method, of, creating, holographic, interferograms, a, holograph, of, the, unstressed, object, is, created, this, holograph, is, illuminated, with, a, reference, beam, to, generate, a, hologram, image, of, the, object, directly, superimposed, over, the, original, object, itself, while, the, object, is, being, subjected, to, some, stress, the, object, waves, from, this, hologram, image, will, interfere, with, new, waves, coming, from, the, object, this, technique, allows, real, time, monitoring, of, shape, changes, the, third, method, time, average, holography, involves, creating, a, holograph, while, the, object, is, subjected, to, a, periodic, stress, or, vibration, this, yields, a, visual, image, of, the, vibration, pattern, interferometric, synthetic, aperture, radar, insar, is, a, radar, technique, used, in, geodesy, and, remote, sensing, satellite, synthetic, aperture, radar, images, of, a, geographic, feature, are, taken, on, separate, days, and, changes, that, have, taken, place, between, radar, images, taken, on, the, separate, days, are, recorded, as, fringes, similar, to, those, obtained, in, holographic, interferometry, the, technique, can, monitor, centimeter, to, millimeter, scale, deformation, resulting, from, earthquakes, volcanoes, and, landslides, and, also, has, uses, in, structural, engineering, in, particular, for, the, monitoring, of, subsidence, and, structural, stability, fig, 20, shows, kilauea, an, active, volcano, in, hawaii, data, acquired, using, the, space, shuttle, endeavour, s, x, band, synthetic, aperture, radar, on, april, 13, 1994, and, october, 4, 1994, were, used, to, generate, interferometric, fringes, which, were, overlaid, on, the, x, sar, image, of, kilauea, electronic, speckle, pattern, interferometry, espi, also, known, as, tv, holography, uses, video, detection, and, recording, to, produce, an, image, of, the, object, upon, which, is, superimposed, a, fringe, pattern, which, represents, the, displacement, of, the, object, between, recordings, see, fig, 21, the, fringes, are, similar, to, those, obtained, in, holographic, interferometry, 111, 120, when, lasers, were, first, invented, laser, speckle, was, considered, to, be, a, severe, drawback, in, using, lasers, to, illuminate, objects, particularly, in, holographic, imaging, because, of, the, grainy, image, produced, it, was, later, realized, that, speckle, patterns, could, carry, information, about, the, object, s, surface, deformations, butters, and, leendertz, developed, the, technique, of, speckle, pattern, interferometry, in, 1970, and, since, then, speckle, has, been, exploited, in, a, variety, of, other, applications, a, photograph, is, made, of, the, speckle, pattern, before, deformation, and, a, second, photograph, is, made, of, the, speckle, pattern, after, deformation, digital, subtraction, of, the, two, images, results, in, a, correlation, fringe, pattern, where, the, fringes, represent, lines, of, equal, deformation, short, laser, pulses, in, the, nanosecond, range, can, be, used, to, capture, very, fast, transient, events, a, phase, problem, exists, in, the, absence, of, other, information, one, cannot, tell, the, difference, between, contour, lines, indicating, a, peak, versus, contour, lines, indicating, a, trough, to, resolve, the, issue, of, phase, ambiguity, espi, may, be, combined, with, phase, shifting, methods, a, method, of, establishing, precise, geodetic, baselines, invented, by, yrj, v, is, l, exploited, the, low, coherence, length, of, white, light, initially, white, light, was, split, in, two, with, the, reference, beam, folded, bouncing, back, and, forth, six, times, between, a, mirror, pair, spaced, precisely, 1, m, apart, only, if, the, test, path, was, precisely, 6, times, the, reference, path, would, fringes, be, seen, repeated, applications, of, this, procedure, allowed, precise, measurement, of, distances, up, to, 864, meters, baselines, thus, established, were, used, to, calibrate, geodetic, distance, measurement, equipment, leading, to, a, metrologically, traceable, scale, for, geodetic, networks, measured, by, these, instruments, this, method, has, been, superseded, by, gps, other, uses, of, interferometers, have, been, to, study, dispersion, of, materials, measurement, of, complex, indices, of, refraction, and, thermal, properties, they, are, also, used, for, three, dimensional, motion, mapping, including, mapping, vibrational, patterns, of, structures, optical, interferometry, applied, to, biology, and, medicine, provides, sensitive, metrology, capabilities, for, the, measurement, of, biomolecules, subcellular, components, cells, and, tissues, many, forms, of, label, free, biosensors, rely, on, interferometry, because, the, direct, interaction, of, electromagnetic, fields, with, local, molecular, polarizability, eliminates, the, need, for, fluorescent, tags, or, nanoparticle, markers, at, a, larger, scale, cellular, interferometry, shares, aspects, with, phase, contrast, microscopy, but, comprises, a, much, larger, class, of, phase, sensitive, optical, configurations, that, rely, on, optical, interference, among, cellular, constituents, through, refraction, and, diffraction, at, the, tissue, scale, partially, coherent, forward, scattered, light, propagation, through, the, micro, aberrations, and, heterogeneity, of, tissue, structure, provides, opportunities, to, use, phase, sensitive, gating, optical, coherence, tomography, as, well, as, phase, sensitive, fluctuation, spectroscopy, to, image, subtle, structural, and, dynamical, properties, optical, coherence, tomography, oct, is, a, medical, imaging, technique, using, low, coherence, interferometry, to, provide, tomographic, visualization, of, internal, tissue, microstructures, as, seen, in, fig, 22, the, core, of, a, typical, oct, system, is, a, michelson, interferometer, one, interferometer, arm, is, focused, onto, the, tissue, sample, and, scans, the, sample, in, an, x, y, longitudinal, raster, pattern, the, other, interferometer, arm, is, bounced, off, a, reference, mirror, reflected, light, from, the, tissue, sample, is, combined, with, reflected, light, from, the, reference, because, of, the, low, coherence, of, the, light, source, interferometric, signal, is, observed, only, over, a, limited, depth, of, sample, x, y, scanning, therefore, records, one, thin, optical, slice, of, the, sample, at, a, time, by, performing, multiple, scans, moving, the, reference, mirror, between, each, scan, an, entire, three, dimensional, image, of, the, tissue, can, be, reconstructed, recent, advances, have, striven, to, combine, the, nanometer, phase, retrieval, of, coherent, interferometry, with, the, ranging, capability, of, low, coherence, interferometry, phase, contrast, and, differential, interference, contrast, dic, microscopy, are, important, tools, in, biology, and, medicine, most, animal, cells, and, single, celled, organisms, have, very, little, color, and, their, intracellular, organelles, are, almost, totally, invisible, under, simple, bright, field, illumination, these, structures, can, be, made, visible, by, staining, the, specimens, but, staining, procedures, are, time, consuming, and, kill, the, cells, as, seen, in, figs, 24, and, 25, phase, contrast, and, dic, microscopes, allow, unstained, living, cells, to, be, studied, dic, also, has, non, biological, applications, for, example, in, the, analysis, of, planar, silicon, semiconductor, processing, angle, resolved, low, coherence, interferometry, a, lci, uses, scattered, light, to, measure, the, sizes, of, subcellular, objects, including, cell, nuclei, this, allows, interferometry, depth, measurements, to, be, combined, with, density, measurements, various, correlations, have, been, found, between, the, state, of, tissue, health, and, the, measurements, of, subcellular, objects, for, example, it, has, been, found, that, as, tissue, changes, from, normal, to, cancerous, the, average, cell, nuclei, size, increases, phase, contrast, x, ray, imaging, fig, 26, refers, to, a, variety, of, techniques, that, use, phase, information, of, a, coherent, x, ray, beam, to, image, soft, tissues, for, an, elementary, discussion, see, phase, contrast, x, ray, imaging, introduction, for, a, more, in, depth, review, see, phase, contrast, x, ray, imaging, it, has, become, an, important, method, for, visualizing, cellular, and, histological, structures, in, a, wide, range, of, biological, and, medical, studies, there, are, several, technologies, being, used, for, x, ray, phase, contrast, imaging, all, utilizing, different, principles, to, convert, phase, variations, in, the, x, rays, emerging, from, an, object, into, intensity, variations, these, include, propagation, based, phase, contrast, talbot, interferometry, moir, based, far, field, interferometry, refraction, enhanced, imaging, and, x, ray, interferometry, these, methods, provide, higher, contrast, compared, to, normal, absorption, contrast, x, ray, imaging, making, it, possible, to, see, smaller, details, a, disadvantage, is, that, these, methods, require, more, sophisticated, equipment, such, as, synchrotron, or, microfocus, x, ray, sources, x, ray, optics, or, high, resolution, x, ray, detectors
