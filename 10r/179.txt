a, candle, is, an, ignitable, wick, embedded, in, wax, or, another, flammable, solid, substance, such, as, tallow, that, provides, light, and, in, some, cases, a, fragrance, a, candle, can, also, provide, heat, or, a, method, of, keeping, time, candles, have, been, used, for, over, two, millennia, around, the, world, and, were, a, significant, form, of, indoor, lighting, until, the, invention, of, other, types, of, light, sources, although, electric, light, has, largely, made, candle, use, nonessential, for, illumination, candles, are, still, commonly, used, for, functional, symbolic, and, aesthetic, purposes, and, in, specific, cultural, and, religious, settings, early, candles, may, be, made, of, beeswax, but, these, candles, were, expensive, and, their, use, was, limited, to, the, elite, and, the, churches, tallow, was, a, cheaper, but, a, less, aesthetically, pleasing, alternative, a, variety, of, different, materials, have, been, developed, in, the, modern, era, for, making, candles, including, paraffin, wax, which, together, with, efficient, production, techniques, made, candles, affordable, for, the, masses, various, devices, can, be, used, to, hold, candles, such, as, candlesticks, or, candelabras, chandeliers, lanterns, and, sconces, a, person, who, makes, candles, is, traditionally, known, as, a, chandler, the, combustion, of, the, candle, proceeds, in, self, sustaining, manner, as, the, wick, of, candle, is, lit, the, heat, melts, and, ignites, a, small, amount, of, solid, fuel, the, wax, which, vaporizes, and, combines, with, oxygen, in, the, air, to, form, a, flame, the, flame, then, melts, the, top, of, the, mass, of, solid, fuel, which, moves, upward, through, the, wick, via, capillary, action, to, be, continually, burnt, thereby, maintaining, a, constant, flame, the, candle, shortens, as, the, solid, fuel, is, consumed, so, does, the, wick, wicks, of, pre, 19th, century, candles, required, regular, trimming, with, scissors, or, snuffers, to, promote, steady, burning, and, prevent, smoking, in, modern, candles, the, wick, is, constructed, so, that, it, curves, over, as, it, burns, and, the, end, of, the, wick, gets, trimmed, by, itself, through, incineration, by, fire, the, word, candle, comes, from, middle, english, candel, from, old, english, and, from, anglo, norman, candele, both, from, latin, cand, la, from, cand, re, to, shine, prior, to, the, invention, of, candles, ancient, people, used, open, fire, torches, splinters, of, resinous, wood, and, lamps, to, provide, artificial, illumination, at, night, primitive, oil, lamps, in, which, a, lit, wick, rested, in, a, pool, of, oil, or, fat, were, used, from, the, paleolithic, period, and, pottery, and, stone, lamps, from, the, neolithic, period, have, been, found, because, candle, making, requires, a, reliable, supply, of, animal, or, vegetable, fats, it, is, certain, that, candles, could, not, have, developed, before, the, early, bronze, age, however, it, is, unclear, when, and, where, candles, were, first, used, objects, that, could, be, candlesticks, have, been, found, in, babylonian, and, middle, minoan, cultures, as, well, in, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, the, candles, used, in, these, early, periods, would, not, have, resembled, the, current, forms, more, likely, they, were, made, of, plant, materials, dipped, in, animal, fat, early, evidence, of, candle, use, may, be, found, in, italy, where, depiction, of, a, candlestick, exists, in, an, etruscan, tomb, at, orvieto, and, the, earliest, excavated, etruscan, candlestick, dates, from, the, 7th, century, bc, candles, may, have, evolved, from, taper, with, wick, of, oakum, and, other, plant, fibre, soaked, in, fat, pitch, or, oil, and, burned, in, lamps, or, pots, candles, of, antiquity, were, made, from, various, forms, of, natural, fat, tallow, and, wax, and, romans, made, true, dipped, candles, from, tallow, and, beeswax, beeswax, candles, were, expensive, and, their, use, was, limited, to, the, wealthy, instead, oil, lamps, were, the, more, commonly, used, lighting, devices, in, roman, times, ancient, greece, used, torches, and, oil, lamps, and, likely, adopted, candle, use, in, a, later, period, from, rome, early, record, in, china, suggests, that, candle, was, used, in, the, qin, dynasty, before, 200, bc, these, early, chinese, candles, may, have, been, made, from, whale, fat, in, christianity, candles, gained, significance, in, their, decorative, symbolic, and, ceremonial, uses, in, churches, wax, candles, or, candela, cerea, recorded, at, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, were, documented, as, easter, candles, in, spain, and, italy, in, the, fourth, century, the, christian, festival, candlemas, was, named, after, it, and, pope, sergius, i, instituted, the, procession, of, lighted, candles, papal, bulls, decreed, that, tallow, be, excluded, for, use, in, altar, candles, and, a, high, beeswax, content, is, necessary, for, candles, of, the, high, altar, in, medieval, europe, candles, were, initially, used, primarily, in, christian, churches, its, use, spread, later, to, the, households, of, the, wealthy, as, a, luxury, item, in, northern, europe, rushlight, made, of, greased, rushes, were, commonly, used, especially, in, england, but, tallow, candles, were, used, during, the, middle, ages, with, a, mention, of, tallow, candles, in, english, appearing, in, 1154, beeswax, was, widely, used, in, church, ceremonies, and, compared, to, animal, based, tallow, it, burns, cleanly, without, smoky, flame, and, does, not, release, an, unpleasant, smell, like, tallow, beeswax, candles, were, expensive, and, relatively, few, people, could, afford, to, burn, them, in, their, homes, in, medieval, europe, the, candles, were, produced, using, a, number, of, methods, dipping, the, wick, in, molten, fat, or, wax, rolling, the, candle, by, hand, around, a, wick, or, pouring, fat, or, wax, onto, a, wick, to, build, up, the, candle, in, the, 14th, century, sieur, de, brez, introduced, the, technique, of, using, a, mould, but, real, improvement, for, the, efficient, production, of, candles, with, mould, was, only, achieved, in, the, 19th, century, wax, and, tallow, candles, were, made, in, monasteries, in, the, medieval, period, and, in, rural, households, tallow, candles, may, be, made, at, home, by, the, 13th, century, candle, making, had, become, a, guild, craft, in, england, and, france, with, a, french, guild, documented, as, early, as, 1061, the, candle, makers, chandlers, went, from, house, to, house, making, candles, from, the, kitchen, fats, saved, for, that, purpose, or, made, and, sold, their, own, candles, from, small, candle, shops, by, the, 16th, century, beeswax, candles, were, appearing, as, luxury, household, items, among, the, wealthy, candles, were, widely, used, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, a, party, in, dresden, was, said, to, have, been, lit, by, 14, 000, candles, in, 1779, in, the, middle, east, during, the, abbasid, and, fatimid, caliphates, beeswax, was, the, dominant, material, used, for, candle, making, beeswax, was, often, imported, from, long, distances, for, example, candle, makers, from, egypt, used, beeswax, from, tunis, as, in, europe, these, candles, were, expensive, and, limited, to, the, elite, and, most, commoners, used, oil, lamps, instead, according, to, legend, the, practice, of, using, lamps, and, candles, in, mosque, started, with, tamim, al, dari, who, lit, a, lamp, he, brought, from, syria, in, the, prophet, s, mosque, in, medina, the, umayyad, caliph, al, walid, ii, was, known, to, have, used, candles, in, the, court, in, damascus, while, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mutawakkil, was, said, to, have, spent, 1, 2, million, silver, dirhams, annually, on, candles, for, his, royal, palaces, in, early, modern, syria, candles, were, in, high, demand, by, all, socioeconomic, classes, because, they, were, customarily, lit, during, marriage, ceremonies, there, were, candle, makers, guilds, in, the, safavid, capital, of, isfahan, during, the, 1500s, and, 1600s, however, candle, makers, had, a, relatively, low, social, position, in, safavid, iran, comparable, to, barbers, bathhouse, workers, fortune, tellers, bricklayers, and, porters, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, spermaceti, a, waxy, substance, produced, by, the, sperm, whale, was, used, to, produce, a, superior, candle, that, burned, longer, brighter, and, gave, off, no, offensive, smell, later, in, the, 18th, century, colza, oil, and, rapeseed, oil, came, into, use, as, much, cheaper, substitutes, a, number, of, improvements, were, made, to, candle, in, the, 19th, century, in, older, candles, the, wick, of, a, burning, candle, was, not, in, direct, contact, with, air, so, it, charred, instead, of, being, burnt, the, charred, wick, inhibited, further, burning, and, produced, black, smoke, so, the, wick, needed, to, be, constantly, trimmed, or, snuffed, in, 1825, a, french, man, m, cambac, r, s, introduced, the, plaited, wick, soaked, with, mineral, salts, which, when, burnt, curled, towards, the, outer, edge, of, the, flame, and, become, incinerated, by, it, thereby, trimming, itself, these, are, referred, to, as, self, trimming, or, self, consuming, wicks, in, 1823, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, and, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, separate, out, stearin, in, animal, fats, and, obtained, a, patent, in, 1825, to, produce, candles, that, are, harder, and, can, burn, brighter, the, manufacture, of, candles, became, an, industrialized, mass, market, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, 1834, joseph, morgan, a, pewterer, from, manchester, england, patented, a, machine, that, revolutionised, candle, making, it, allowed, for, continuous, production, of, molded, candles, by, using, a, cylinder, with, a, moveable, piston, to, eject, candles, as, they, solidified, this, more, efficient, mechanized, production, produced, about, 1, 500, candles, per, hour, this, allowed, candles, to, be, an, affordable, commodity, for, the, masses, in, the, mid, 1850s, james, young, succeeded, in, distilling, paraffin, wax, from, coal, and, oil, shales, at, bathgate, in, west, lothian, and, developed, a, commercially, viable, method, of, production, paraffin, could, be, used, to, make, inexpensive, candles, of, high, quality, it, was, a, bluish, white, wax, which, burned, cleanly, and, left, no, unpleasant, odor, unlike, tallow, candles, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, candles, were, made, from, paraffin, wax, and, stearic, acid, by, the, late, 19th, century, price, s, candles, based, in, london, was, the, largest, candle, manufacturer, in, the, world, founded, by, william, wilson, in, 1830, the, company, pioneered, the, implementation, of, the, technique, of, steam, distillation, and, was, thus, able, to, manufacture, candles, from, a, wide, range, of, raw, materials, including, skin, fat, bone, fat, fish, oil, and, industrial, greases, despite, advances, in, candle, making, the, candle, industry, declined, rapidly, upon, the, introduction, of, superior, methods, of, lighting, including, kerosene, and, lamps, and, the, 1879, invention, of, the, incandescent, light, bulb, from, this, point, on, candles, came, to, be, marketed, as, more, of, a, decorative, item, before, the, invention, of, electric, lighting, candles, and, oil, lamps, were, commonly, used, for, illumination, in, areas, without, electricity, they, are, still, used, routinely, until, the, 20th, century, candles, were, more, common, in, northern, europe, in, southern, europe, and, the, mediterranean, oil, lamps, predominated, in, the, developed, world, today, candles, are, used, mainly, for, their, aesthetic, value, and, scent, particularly, to, set, a, soft, warm, or, romantic, ambiance, for, emergency, lighting, during, electrical, power, failures, and, for, religious, or, ritual, purposes, in, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, a, huge, spike, in, sales, of, scented, candles, in, recent, years, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, the, ensuing, lockdowns, led, to, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, sales, of, scented, candles, diffusers, and, room, sprays, with, the, fairly, consistent, and, measurable, burning, of, a, candle, a, common, use, of, candles, was, to, tell, the, time, the, candle, designed, for, this, purpose, might, have, time, measurements, usually, in, hours, marked, along, the, wax, the, song, dynasty, in, china, 960, 1279, used, candle, clocks, by, the, 18th, century, candle, clocks, were, being, made, with, weights, set, into, the, sides, of, the, candle, as, the, candle, melted, the, weights, fell, off, and, made, a, noise, as, they, fell, into, a, bowl, in, the, days, leading, to, christmas, some, people, burn, a, candle, a, set, amount, to, represent, each, day, as, marked, on, the, candle, the, type, of, candle, used, in, this, way, is, called, the, advent, candle, although, this, term, is, also, used, to, refer, to, a, candle, that, are, used, in, an, advent, wreath, for, most, of, recorded, history, candles, were, made, from, tallow, rendered, from, beef, or, mutton, fat, or, beeswax, from, the, mid, 1800s, they, were, also, made, from, spermaceti, a, waxy, substance, derived, from, the, sperm, whale, which, in, turn, spurred, demand, for, the, substance, candles, were, also, made, from, stearin, initially, manufactured, from, animal, fats, but, now, produced, almost, exclusively, from, palm, waxes, today, most, candles, are, made, from, paraffin, wax, a, byproduct, of, petroleum, refining, candles, can, also, be, made, from, microcrystalline, wax, beeswax, a, byproduct, of, honey, collection, gel, a, mixture, of, polymer, and, mineral, oil, or, some, plant, waxes, generally, palm, carnauba, bayberry, or, soybean, wax, the, size, of, the, flame, and, corresponding, rate, of, burning, is, controlled, largely, by, the, candle, wick, the, kind, of, wax, also, affects, the, burn, rate, with, beeswax, and, coconut, wax, burning, longer, than, paraffin, or, soy, wax, production, methods, utilize, extrusion, moulding, more, traditional, production, methods, entail, melting, the, solid, fuel, by, the, controlled, application, of, heat, the, liquid, is, then, poured, into, a, mould, or, a, wick, is, repeatedly, immersed, in, the, liquid, to, create, a, dipped, tapered, candle, often, fragrance, oils, essential, oils, or, aniline, based, dye, is, added, a, candle, wick, works, by, capillary, action, drawing, wicking, the, melted, wax, or, fuel, up, to, the, flame, when, the, liquid, fuel, reaches, the, flame, it, vaporizes, and, combusts, the, candle, wick, influences, how, the, candle, burns, important, characteristics, of, the, wick, include, diameter, stiffness, fire, resistance, and, tethering, a, candle, wick, is, a, piece, of, string, or, cord, that, holds, the, flame, of, a, candle, commercial, wicks, are, made, from, braided, cotton, the, wick, s, capillarity, determines, the, rate, at, which, the, melted, hydrocarbon, is, conveyed, to, the, flame, if, the, capillarity, is, too, great, the, molten, wax, streams, down, the, side, of, the, candle, wicks, are, often, infused, with, a, variety, of, chemicals, to, modify, their, burning, characteristics, for, example, it, is, usually, desirable, that, the, wick, not, glow, after, the, flame, is, extinguished, typical, agents, are, ammonium, nitrate, and, ammonium, sulfate, based, on, measurements, of, a, taper, type, paraffin, wax, candle, a, modern, candle, typically, burns, at, a, steady, rate, of, about, 0, 1, g, min, releasing, heat, at, roughly, 80, w, the, light, produced, is, about, 13, lumens, for, a, luminous, efficacy, of, about, 0, 16, lumens, per, watt, luminous, efficacy, of, a, source, almost, a, hundred, times, lower, than, an, incandescent, light, bulb, if, a, 1, candela, source, emitted, uniformly, in, all, directions, the, total, radiant, flux, would, be, only, about, 18, 40, mw, the, luminous, intensity, of, a, typical, candle, is, approximately, one, candela, the, si, unit, candela, was, in, fact, based, on, an, older, unit, called, the, candlepower, which, represented, the, luminous, intensity, emitted, by, a, candle, made, to, particular, specifications, a, standard, candle, the, modern, unit, is, defined, in, a, more, precise, and, repeatable, way, but, was, chosen, such, that, a, candle, s, luminous, intensity, is, still, about, one, candela, the, hottest, part, of, a, candle, flame, is, just, above, the, very, dull, blue, part, to, one, side, of, the, flame, at, the, base, at, this, point, the, flame, is, about, 1, 400, c, 2, 550, f, however, this, part, of, the, flame, is, very, small, and, releases, little, heat, energy, the, blue, color, is, due, to, chemiluminescence, while, the, visible, yellow, color, is, due, to, radiative, emission, from, hot, soot, particles, the, soot, is, formed, through, a, series, of, complex, chemical, reactions, leading, from, the, fuel, molecule, through, molecular, growth, until, multi, carbon, ring, compounds, are, formed, the, thermal, structure, of, a, flame, is, complex, hundreds, of, degrees, over, very, short, distances, leading, to, extremely, steep, temperature, gradients, on, average, the, flame, temperature, is, about, 1, 000, c, 1, 800, f, the, color, temperature, is, approximately, 1, 000, k, for, a, candle, to, burn, a, heat, source, commonly, a, naked, flame, from, a, match, or, lighter, is, used, to, light, the, candle, s, wick, which, melts, and, vaporizes, a, small, amount, of, fuel, the, wax, once, vaporized, the, fuel, combines, with, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, to, ignite, and, form, a, constant, flame, this, flame, provides, sufficient, heat, to, keep, the, candle, burning, via, a, self, sustaining, chain, of, events, the, heat, of, the, flame, melts, the, top, of, the, mass, of, solid, fuel, the, liquefied, fuel, then, moves, upward, through, the, wick, via, capillary, action, the, liquefied, fuel, finally, vaporizes, to, burn, within, the, candle, s, flame, as, the, fuel, wax, is, melted, and, burned, the, candle, becomes, shorter, the, end, of, the, plaited, wick, bends, and, get, consumed, in, the, flame, the, incineration, of, the, wick, limits, the, length, of, the, exposed, portion, of, the, wick, thus, maintaining, a, constant, burning, temperature, and, rate, of, fuel, consumption, pre, 19th, century, wicks, required, regular, trimming, with, scissors, or, a, specialized, wick, trimmer, usually, to, about, one, quarter, inch, 0, 7, cm, to, promote, steady, burning, and, to, prevent, it, from, releasing, black, smoke, special, candle, scissors, called, snuffers, were, produced, for, this, purpose, in, the, 20th, century, and, were, often, combined, with, an, extinguisher, in, modern, candles, the, wick, is, made, in, such, a, way, that, it, curves, over, as, it, burns, which, ensures, that, the, end, of, the, wick, gets, incinerated, by, fire, thereby, trimming, itself, a, candle, flame, is, formed, because, wax, vaporizes, on, burning, a, candle, flame, is, widely, recognized, as, having, between, three, and, five, regions, or, zones, the, main, determinant, of, the, height, of, a, candle, flame, is, the, diameter, of, the, wick, this, is, evidenced, in, tealights, where, the, wick, is, very, thin, and, the, flame, is, very, small, candles, whose, main, purpose, is, illumination, use, a, much, thicker, wick, one, of, michael, faraday, s, significant, works, was, the, chemical, history, of, a, candle, where, he, gives, an, in, depth, analysis, of, the, evolutionary, development, workings, and, science, of, candles, according, to, the, national, fire, protection, association, candles, are, a, leading, source, of, residential, fires, in, the, united, states, with, almost, 10, of, civilian, injuries, and, 6, of, fatalities, from, fire, attributed, to, candles, a, candle, flame, that, is, longer, than, its, laminar, smoke, point, will, emit, soot, proper, wick, trimming, will, reduce, soot, emissions, from, most, candles, the, liquid, wax, is, hot, and, can, cause, skin, burns, but, the, amount, and, temperature, are, generally, rather, limited, and, the, burns, are, seldom, serious, the, best, way, to, avoid, getting, burned, from, splashed, wax, is, to, use, a, candle, snuffer, instead, of, blowing, on, the, flame, a, candle, snuffer, is, usually, a, small, metal, cup, on, the, end, of, a, long, handle, placing, the, snuffer, over, the, flame, cuts, off, the, oxygen, supply, snuffers, were, common, in, the, home, when, candles, were, the, main, source, of, lighting, before, electric, lights, were, available, ornate, snuffers, often, combined, with, a, taper, for, lighting, are, still, found, in, those, churches, which, regularly, use, large, candles, glass, candle, holders, are, sometimes, cracked, by, thermal, shock, from, the, candle, flame, particularly, when, the, candle, burns, down, to, the, end, when, burning, candles, in, glass, holders, or, jars, users, should, avoid, lighting, candles, with, chipped, or, cracked, containers, and, stop, use, once, a, half, inch, or, less, of, wax, remains, a, former, worry, regarding, the, safety, of, candles, was, that, a, lead, core, was, used, in, the, wicks, to, keep, them, upright, in, container, candles, without, a, stiff, core, the, wicks, of, a, container, candle, could, sag, and, drown, in, the, deep, wax, pool, concerns, rose, that, the, lead, in, these, wicks, would, vaporize, during, the, burning, process, releasing, lead, vapors, a, known, health, and, developmental, hazard, lead, core, wicks, have, not, been, common, since, the, 1970s, today, most, metal, cored, wicks, use, zinc, or, a, zinc, alloy, which, has, become, the, industry, standard, wicks, made, from, specially, treated, paper, and, cotton, are, also, available, candles, emit, volatile, organic, compounds, into, the, environment, which, releases, carbon, into, the, air, the, combustion, process, of, lighting, a, candle, includes, the, release, of, light, heat, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, to, fuel, the, flame, candle, use, can, be, unsafe, if, fragrances, are, inhaled, at, high, doses, non, toxic, candles, have, been, created, as, an, alternative, to, prevent, these, volatile, organic, compounds, from, being, released, into, the, environment, candle, companies, such, as, the, plant, project, have, created, candles, that, are, more, environmentally, sustainable, and, better, for, lung, health, these, alternatives, include, non, toxic, wax, blends, safe, fragrances, and, eco, friendly, packaging, safer, candles, include, candles, made, from, coconut, soy, vegetable, and, beeswax, users, who, seek, the, aesthetics, of, a, candle, sometimes, install, an, electric, flameless, candle, to, avoid, the, hazards, international, markets, have, developed, a, range, of, standards, and, regulations, to, ensure, compliance, while, maintaining, and, improving, safety, including, decorative, candleholders, especially, those, shaped, as, a, pedestal, are, called, candlesticks, if, multiple, candle, tapers, are, held, the, term, candelabrum, is, also, used, the, root, form, of, chandelier, is, from, the, word, for, candle, but, now, usually, refers, to, an, electric, fixture, the, word, chandelier, is, sometimes, now, used, to, describe, a, hanging, fixture, designed, to, hold, multiple, tapers, many, candle, holders, use, a, friction, tight, socket, to, keep, the, candle, upright, in, this, case, a, candle, that, is, slightly, too, wide, will, not, fit, in, the, holder, and, a, candle, that, is, slightly, too, narrow, will, wobble, candles, that, are, too, big, can, be, trimmed, to, fit, with, a, knife, candles, that, are, too, small, can, be, fitted, with, aluminium, foil, traditionally, the, candle, and, candle, holders, were, made, in, the, same, place, so, they, were, appropriately, sized, but, international, trade, has, combined, the, modern, candle, with, existing, holders, which, makes, the, ill, fitting, candle, more, common, this, friction, tight, socket, is, only, needed, for, the, federals, and, the, tapers, for, tea, light, candles, there, is, a, variety, of, candle, holders, including, small, glass, holders, and, elaborate, multi, candle, stands, the, same, is, true, for, votives, wall, sconces, are, available, for, tea, light, and, votive, candles, for, pillar, type, candles, the, assortment, of, candle, holders, is, broad, a, fireproof, plate, such, as, a, glass, plate, or, small, mirror, can, be, a, candle, holder, for, a, pillar, style, candle, a, pedestal, of, any, kind, with, the, appropriate, sized, fireproof, top, is, another, option, a, large, glass, bowl, with, a, large, flat, bottom, and, tall, mostly, vertical, curved, sides, is, called, a, hurricane, the, pillar, style, candle, is, placed, at, the, bottom, center, of, the, hurricane, a, hurricane, on, a, pedestal, is, sometimes, sold, as, a, unit, a, bob, che, is, a, drip, catching, ring, which, may, also, be, affixed, to, a, candle, holder, or, used, independently, of, one, bob, ches, can, range, from, ornate, metal, or, glass, to, simple, plastic, cardboard, or, wax,
