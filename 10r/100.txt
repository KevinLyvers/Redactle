the, internet, or, internet, is, the, global, system, of, interconnected, computer, networks, that, uses, the, internet, protocol, suite, tcp, ip, to, communicate, between, networks, and, devices, it, is, a, network, of, networks, that, consists, of, private, public, academic, business, and, government, networks, of, local, to, global, scope, linked, by, a, broad, array, of, electronic, wireless, and, optical, networking, technologies, the, internet, carries, a, vast, range, of, information, resources, and, services, such, as, the, interlinked, hypertext, documents, and, applications, of, the, world, wide, web, www, electronic, mail, telephony, and, file, sharing, the, origins, of, the, internet, date, back, to, research, that, enabled, the, time, sharing, of, computer, resources, and, the, development, of, packet, switching, in, the, 1960s, the, set, of, rules, communication, protocols, to, enable, internetworking, on, the, internet, arose, from, research, and, development, commissioned, in, the, 1970s, by, the, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, darpa, of, the, united, states, department, of, defense, in, collaboration, with, universities, and, researchers, across, the, united, states, and, in, the, united, kingdom, and, france, the, arpanet, initially, served, as, a, backbone, for, the, interconnection, of, regional, academic, and, military, networks, in, the, united, states, to, enable, resource, sharing, the, funding, of, the, national, science, foundation, network, as, a, new, backbone, in, the, 1980s, as, well, as, private, funding, for, other, commercial, extensions, encouraged, worldwide, participation, in, the, development, of, new, networking, technologies, and, the, merger, of, many, networks, using, darpa, s, internet, protocol, suite, the, linking, of, commercial, networks, and, enterprises, by, the, early, 1990s, as, well, as, the, advent, of, the, world, wide, web, marked, the, beginning, of, the, transition, to, the, modern, internet, and, generated, sustained, exponential, growth, as, generations, of, institutional, personal, and, mobile, computers, were, connected, to, the, network, although, the, internet, was, widely, used, by, academia, in, the, 1980s, the, subsequent, commercialization, in, the, 1990s, and, beyond, incorporated, its, services, and, technologies, into, virtually, every, aspect, of, modern, life, most, traditional, communication, media, including, telephone, radio, television, paper, mail, and, newspapers, are, reshaped, redefined, or, even, bypassed, by, the, internet, giving, birth, to, new, services, such, as, email, internet, telephone, internet, television, online, music, digital, newspapers, and, video, streaming, websites, newspapers, books, and, other, print, publishing, have, adapted, to, website, technology, or, have, been, reshaped, into, blogging, web, feeds, and, online, news, aggregators, the, internet, has, enabled, and, accelerated, new, forms, of, personal, interaction, through, instant, messaging, internet, forums, and, social, networking, services, online, shopping, has, grown, exponentially, for, major, retailers, small, businesses, and, entrepreneurs, as, it, enables, firms, to, extend, their, brick, and, mortar, presence, to, serve, a, larger, market, or, even, sell, goods, and, services, entirely, online, business, to, business, and, financial, services, on, the, internet, affect, supply, chains, across, entire, industries, the, internet, has, no, single, centralized, governance, in, either, technological, implementation, or, policies, for, access, and, usage, each, constituent, network, sets, its, own, policies, the, overarching, definitions, of, the, two, principal, name, spaces, on, the, internet, the, internet, protocol, address, ip, address, space, and, the, domain, name, system, dns, are, directed, by, a, maintainer, organization, the, internet, corporation, for, assigned, names, and, numbers, icann, the, technical, underpinning, and, standardization, of, the, core, protocols, is, an, activity, of, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, a, non, profit, organization, of, loosely, affiliated, international, participants, that, anyone, may, associate, with, by, contributing, technical, expertise, in, november, 2006, the, internet, was, included, on, usa, today, s, list, of, the, new, seven, wonders, the, word, internetted, was, used, as, early, as, 1849, meaning, interconnected, or, interwoven, the, word, internet, was, used, in, 1945, by, the, united, states, war, department, in, a, radio, operator, s, manual, and, in, 1974, as, the, shorthand, form, of, internetwork, today, the, term, internet, most, commonly, refers, to, the, global, system, of, interconnected, computer, networks, though, it, may, also, refer, to, any, group, of, smaller, networks, when, it, came, into, common, use, most, publications, treated, the, word, internet, as, a, capitalized, proper, noun, this, has, become, less, common, this, reflects, the, tendency, in, english, to, capitalize, new, terms, and, move, them, to, lowercase, as, they, become, familiar, the, word, is, sometimes, still, capitalized, to, distinguish, the, global, internet, from, smaller, networks, though, many, publications, including, the, ap, stylebook, since, 2016, recommend, the, lowercase, form, in, every, case, in, 2016, the, oxford, english, dictionary, found, that, based, on, a, study, of, around, 2, 5, billion, printed, and, online, sources, internet, was, capitalized, in, 54, of, cases, the, terms, internet, and, world, wide, web, are, often, used, interchangeably, it, is, common, to, speak, of, going, on, the, internet, when, using, a, web, browser, to, view, web, pages, however, the, world, wide, web, or, the, web, is, only, one, of, a, large, number, of, internet, services, a, collection, of, documents, web, pages, and, other, web, resources, linked, by, hyperlinks, and, urls, in, the, 1960s, computer, scientists, began, developing, systems, for, time, sharing, of, computer, resources, j, c, r, licklider, proposed, the, idea, of, a, universal, network, while, working, at, bolt, beranek, newman, and, later, leading, the, information, processing, techniques, office, ipto, at, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, arpa, of, the, united, states, department, of, defense, dod, research, into, packet, switching, one, of, the, fundamental, internet, technologies, started, in, the, work, of, paul, baran, at, rand, in, the, early, 1960s, and, independently, donald, davies, at, the, united, kingdom, s, national, physical, laboratory, npl, in, 1965, after, the, symposium, on, operating, systems, principles, in, 1967, packet, switching, from, the, proposed, npl, network, and, dynamic, routing, concepts, proposed, by, baran, were, incorporated, into, the, design, of, the, arpanet, an, experimental, resource, sharing, network, proposed, by, arpa, arpanet, development, began, with, two, network, nodes, which, were, interconnected, between, the, university, of, california, los, angeles, ucla, and, the, stanford, research, institute, now, sri, international, on, 29, october, 1969, the, third, site, was, at, the, university, of, california, santa, barbara, followed, by, the, university, of, utah, in, a, sign, of, future, growth, 15, sites, were, connected, to, the, young, arpanet, by, the, end, of, 1971, these, early, years, were, documented, in, the, 1972, film, computer, networks, the, heralds, of, resource, sharing, thereafter, the, arpanet, gradually, developed, into, a, decentralized, communications, network, connecting, remote, centers, and, military, bases, in, the, united, states, other, user, networks, and, research, networks, such, as, the, merit, network, and, cyclades, were, developed, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, early, international, collaborations, for, the, arpanet, were, rare, connections, were, made, in, 1973, to, norway, norsar, and, ndre, and, to, peter, kirstein, s, research, group, at, university, college, london, ucl, which, provided, a, gateway, to, british, academic, networks, forming, the, first, internetwork, for, resource, sharing, arpa, projects, the, international, network, working, group, and, commercial, initiatives, led, to, the, development, of, various, protocols, and, standards, by, which, multiple, separate, networks, could, become, a, single, network, or, a, network, of, networks, in, 1974, vint, cerf, at, stanford, university, and, bob, kahn, at, darpa, published, a, proposal, for, a, protocol, for, packet, network, intercommunication, they, used, the, term, internet, as, a, shorthand, for, internetwork, in, rfc, 675, and, later, rfcs, repeated, this, use, cerf, and, kahn, credit, louis, pouzin, and, others, with, important, influences, on, the, resulting, tcp, ip, design, national, ptts, and, commercial, providers, developed, the, x, 25, standard, and, deployed, it, on, public, data, networks, access, to, the, arpanet, was, expanded, in, 1981, when, the, national, science, foundation, nsf, funded, the, computer, science, network, csnet, in, 1982, the, internet, protocol, suite, tcp, ip, was, standardized, which, facilitated, worldwide, proliferation, of, interconnected, networks, tcp, ip, network, access, expanded, again, in, 1986, when, the, national, science, foundation, network, nsfnet, provided, access, to, supercomputer, sites, in, the, united, states, for, researchers, first, at, speeds, of, 56, kbit, s, and, later, at, 1, 5, mbit, s, and, 45, mbit, s, the, nsfnet, expanded, into, academic, and, research, organizations, in, europe, australia, new, zealand, and, japan, in, 1988, 89, although, other, network, protocols, such, as, uucp, and, ptt, public, data, networks, had, global, reach, well, before, this, time, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, internet, as, an, intercontinental, network, commercial, internet, service, providers, isps, emerged, in, 1989, in, the, united, states, and, australia, the, arpanet, was, decommissioned, in, 1990, steady, advances, in, semiconductor, technology, and, optical, networking, created, new, economic, opportunities, for, commercial, involvement, in, the, expansion, of, the, network, in, its, core, and, for, delivering, services, to, the, public, in, mid, 1989, mci, mail, and, compuserve, established, connections, to, the, internet, delivering, email, and, public, access, products, to, the, half, million, users, of, the, internet, just, months, later, on, 1, january, 1990, psinet, launched, an, alternate, internet, backbone, for, commercial, use, one, of, the, networks, that, added, to, the, core, of, the, commercial, internet, of, later, years, in, march, 1990, the, first, high, speed, t1, 1, 5, mbit, s, link, between, the, nsfnet, and, europe, was, installed, between, cornell, university, and, cern, allowing, much, more, robust, communications, than, were, capable, with, satellites, later, in, 1990, tim, berners, lee, began, writing, worldwideweb, the, first, web, browser, after, two, years, of, lobbying, cern, management, by, christmas, 1990, berners, lee, had, built, all, the, tools, necessary, for, a, working, web, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, http, 0, 9, the, hypertext, markup, language, html, the, first, web, browser, which, was, also, an, html, editor, and, could, access, usenet, newsgroups, and, ftp, files, the, first, http, server, software, later, known, as, cern, httpd, the, first, web, server, and, the, first, web, pages, that, described, the, project, itself, in, 1991, the, commercial, internet, exchange, was, founded, allowing, psinet, to, communicate, with, the, other, commercial, networks, cerfnet, and, alternet, stanford, federal, credit, union, was, the, first, financial, institution, to, offer, online, internet, banking, services, to, all, of, its, members, in, october, 1994, in, 1996, op, financial, group, also, a, cooperative, bank, became, the, second, online, bank, in, the, world, and, the, first, in, europe, by, 1995, the, internet, was, fully, commercialized, in, the, u, s, when, the, nsfnet, was, decommissioned, removing, the, last, restrictions, on, use, of, the, internet, to, carry, commercial, traffic, as, technology, advanced, and, commercial, opportunities, fueled, reciprocal, growth, the, volume, of, internet, traffic, started, experiencing, similar, characteristics, as, that, of, the, scaling, of, mos, transistors, exemplified, by, moore, s, law, doubling, every, 18, months, this, growth, formalized, as, edholm, s, law, was, catalyzed, by, advances, in, mos, technology, laser, light, wave, systems, and, noise, performance, since, 1995, the, internet, has, tremendously, impacted, culture, and, commerce, including, the, rise, of, near, instant, communication, by, email, instant, messaging, telephony, voice, over, internet, protocol, or, voip, two, way, interactive, video, calls, and, the, world, wide, web, with, its, discussion, forums, blogs, social, networking, services, and, online, shopping, sites, increasing, amounts, of, data, are, transmitted, at, higher, and, higher, speeds, over, fiber, optic, networks, operating, at, 1, gbit, s, 10, gbit, s, or, more, the, internet, continues, to, grow, driven, by, ever, greater, amounts, of, online, information, and, knowledge, commerce, entertainment, and, social, networking, services, during, the, late, 1990s, it, was, estimated, that, traffic, on, the, public, internet, grew, by, 100, percent, per, year, while, the, mean, annual, growth, in, the, number, of, internet, users, was, thought, to, be, between, 20, and, 50, this, growth, is, often, attributed, to, the, lack, of, central, administration, which, allows, organic, growth, of, the, network, as, well, as, the, non, proprietary, nature, of, the, internet, protocols, which, encourages, vendor, interoperability, and, prevents, any, one, company, from, exerting, too, much, control, over, the, network, as, of, 31, march, 2011, the, estimated, total, number, of, internet, users, was, 2, 095, billion, 30, of, world, population, it, is, estimated, that, in, 1993, the, internet, carried, only, 1, of, the, information, flowing, through, two, way, telecommunication, by, 2000, this, figure, had, grown, to, 51, and, by, 2007, more, than, 97, of, all, telecommunicated, information, was, carried, over, the, internet, the, internet, is, a, global, network, that, comprises, many, voluntarily, interconnected, autonomous, networks, it, operates, without, a, central, governing, body, the, technical, underpinning, and, standardization, of, the, core, protocols, ipv4, and, ipv6, is, an, activity, of, the, internet, engineering, task,

dns, root, zone, until, the, iana, stewardship, transition, on, 1, october, 2016, the, internet, society, isoc, was, founded, in, 1992, with, a, mission, to, assure, the, open, development, evolution, and, use, of, the, internet, for, the, benefit, of, all, people, throughout, the, world, its, members, include, individuals, anyone, may, join, as, well, as, corporations, organizations, governments, and, universities, among, other, activities, isoc, provides, an, administrative, home, for, a, number, of, less, formally, organized, groups, that, are, involved, in, developing, and, managing, the, internet, including, the, ietf, internet, architecture, board, iab, internet, engineering, steering, group, iesg, internet, research, task, force, irtf, and, internet, research, steering, group, irsg, on, 16, november, 2005, the, united, nations, sponsored, world, summit, on, the, information, society, in, tunis, established, the, internet, governance, forum, igf, to, discuss, internet, related, issues, the, communications, infrastructure, of, the, internet, consists, of, its, hardware, components, and, a, system, of, software, layers, that, control, various, aspects, of, the, architecture, as, with, any, computer, network, the, internet, physically, consists, of, routers, media, such, as, cabling, and, radio, links, repeaters, modems, etc, however, as, an, example, of, internetworking, many, of, the, network, nodes, are, not, necessarily, internet, equipment, per, se, the, internet, packets, are, carried, by, other, full, fledged, networking, protocols, with, the, internet, acting, as, a, homogeneous, networking, standard, running, across, heterogeneous, hardware, with, the, packets, guided, to, their, destinations, by, ip, routers, internet, service, providers, isps, establish,

directly, with, each, other, via, very, high, speed, fiber, optic, cables, and, governed, by, peering, agreements, tier, 2, and, lower, level, networks, buy, internet, transit, from, other, providers, to, reach, at, least, some, parties, on, the, global, internet, though, they, may, also, engage, in, peering, an, isp, may, use, a, single, upstream, provider, for, connectivity, or, implement, multihoming, to, achieve, redundancy, and, load, balancing, internet, exchange, points, are, major, traffic, exchanges, with, physical, connections, to, multiple, isps, large, organizations, such, as, academic, institutions, large, enterprises, and, governments, may, perform, the, same, function, as, isps, engaging, in, peering, and, purchasing, transit, on, behalf, of, their, internal, networks, research, networks, tend, to, interconnect, with, large, subnetworks, such, as, geant, gloriad, internet2, and, the, uk, s, national, research, and, education, network, janet, common, methods, of, internet, access, by, users, include, dial, up, with, a, computer, modem, via, telephone, circuits, broadband, over, coaxial, cable, fiber, optics, or, copper, wires, wi, fi, satellite, and, cellular, telephone, technology, e, g, 3g, 4g, the, internet, may, often, be, accessed, from, computers, in, libraries, and, internet, caf, s, internet, access, points, exist, in, many, public, places, such, as, airport, halls, and, coffee, shops, various, terms, are, used, such, as, public, internet, kiosk, public, access, terminal, and, web, payphone, many, hotels, also, have, public, terminals, that, are, usually, fee, based, these, terminals, are, widely, accessed, for, various, usages, such, as, ticket, booking, bank, deposit, or, online, payment, wi, fi, provides, wireless, access, to, the, internet, via, local, computer, networks, hotspots, providing, such, access, include, wi, fi, caf, s, where, users, need, to, bring, their, own, wireless, devices, such, as, a, laptop, or, pda, these, services, may, be, free, to, all, free, to, customers, only, or, fee, based, grassroots, efforts, have, led, to, wireless, community, networks, commercial, wi, fi, services, that, cover, large, areas, are, available, in, many, cities, such, as, new, york, london, vienna, toronto, san, francisco, philadelphia, chicago, and, pittsburgh, where, the, internet, can, then, be, accessed, from, places, such, as, a, park, bench, experiments, have, also, been, conducted, with, proprietary, mobile, wireless, networks, like, ricochet, various, high, speed, data, services, over, cellular, networks, and, fixed, wireless, services, modern, smartphones, can, also, access, the, internet, through, the, cellular, carrier, network, for, web, browsing, these, devices, provide, applications, such, as, google, chrome, safari, and, firefox, and, a, wide, variety, of, other, internet, software, may, be, installed, from, app, stores, internet, usage, by, mobile, and, tablet, devices, exceeded, desktop, worldwide, for, the, first, time, in, october, 2016, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, estimated, that, by, the, end, of, 2017, 48, of, individual, users, regularly, connect, to, the, internet, up, from, 34, in, 2012, mobile, internet, connectivity, has, played, an, important, role, in, expanding, access, in, recent, years, especially, in, asia, and, the, pacific, and, in, africa, the, number, of, unique, mobile, cellular, subscriptions, increased, from, 3, 9, billion, in, 2012, to, 4, 8, billion, in, 2016, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, population, with, more, than, half, of, subscriptions, located, in, asia, and, the, pacific, the, number, of, subscriptions, was, predicted, to, rise, to, 5, 7, billion, users, in, 2020, as, of, 2018, 80, of, the, world, s, population, were, covered, by, a, 4g, network, the, limits, that, users, face, on, accessing, information, via, mobile, applications, coincide, with, a, broader, process, of, fragmentation, of, the, internet, fragmentation, restricts, access, to, media, content, and, tends, to, affect, the, poorest, users, the, most, zero, rating, the, practice, of, internet, service, providers, allowing, users, free, connectivity, to, access, specific, content, or, applications, without, cost, has, offered, opportunities, to, surmount, economic, hurdles, but, has, also, been, accused, by, its, critics, as, creating, a, two, tiered, internet, to, address, the, issues, with, zero, rating, an, alternative, model, has, emerged, in, the, concept, of, equal, rating, and, is, being, tested, in, experiments, by, mozilla, and, orange, in, africa, equal, rating, prevents, prioritization, of, one, type, of, content, and, zero, rates, all, content, up, to, a, specified, data, cap, in, a, study, published, by, chatham, house, 15, out, of, 19, countries, researched, in, latin, america, had, some, kind, of, hybrid, or, zero, rated, product, offered, some, countries, in, the, region, had, a, handful, of, plans, to, choose, from, across, all, mobile, network, operators, while, others, such, as, colombia, offered, as, many, as, 30, pre, paid, and, 34, post, paid, plans, a, study, of, eight, countries, in, the, global, south, found, that, zero, rated, data, plans, exist, in, every, country, although, there, is, a, great, range, in, the, frequency, with, which, they, are, offered, and, actually, used, in, each, the, study, looked, at, the, top, three, to, five, carriers, by, market, share, in, bangladesh, colombia, ghana, india, kenya, nigeria, peru, and, philippines, across, the, 181, plans, examined, 13, percent, were, offering, zero, rated, services, another, study, covering, ghana, kenya, nigeria, and, south, africa, found, facebook, s, free, basics, and, wikipedia, zero, to, be, the, most, commonly, zero, rated, content, the, internet, standards, describe, a, framework, known, as, the, internet, protocol, suite, also, called, tcp, ip, based, on, the, first, two, components, this, is, a, suite, of, protocols, that, are, ordered, into, a, set, of, four, conceptional, layers, by, the, scope, of, their, operation, originally, documented, in, rfc, 1122, and, rfc, 1123, at, the, top, is, the, application, layer, where, communication, is, described, in, terms, of, the, objects, or, data, structures, most, appropriate, for, each, application, for, example, a, web, browser, operates, in, a, client, server, application, model, and, exchanges, information, with, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, http, and, an, application, germane, data, structure, such, as, the, hypertext, markup, language, html, below, this, top, layer, the, transport, layer, connects, applications, on, different, hosts, with, a, logical, channel, through, the, network, it, provides, this, service, with, a, variety, of, possible, characteristics, such, as, ordered, reliable, delivery, tcp, and, an, unreliable, datagram, service, udp, underlying, these, layers, are, the, networking, technologies, that, interconnect, networks, at, their, borders, and, exchange, traffic, across, them, the, internet, layer, implements, the, internet, protocol, ip, which, enables, computers, to, identify, and, locate, each, other, by, ip, address, and, route, their, traffic, via, intermediate, transit, networks, the, internet, protocol, layer, code, is, independent, of, the, type, of, network, that, it, is, physically, running, over, at, the, bottom, of, the, architecture, is, the, link, layer, which, connects, nodes, on, the, same, physical, link, and, contains, protocols, that, do, not, require, routers, for, traversal, to, other, links, the, protocol, suite, does, not, explicitly, specify, hardware, methods, to, transfer, bits, or, protocols, to, manage, such, hardware, but, assumes, that, appropriate, technology, is, available, examples, of, that, technology, include, wi, fi, ethernet, and, dsl, the, most, prominent, component, of, the, internet, model, is, the, internet, protocol, ip, ip, enables, internetworking, and, in, essence, establishes, the, internet, itself, two, versions, of, the, internet, protocol, exist, ipv4, and, ipv6, for, locating, individual, computers, on, the, network, the, internet, provides, ip, addresses, ip, addresses, are, used, by, the, internet, infrastructure, to, direct, internet, packets, to, their, destinations, they, consist, of, fixed, length, numbers, which, are, found, within, the, packet, ip, addresses, are, generally, assigned, to, equipment, either, automatically, via, dhcp, or, are, configured, however, the, network, also, supports, other, addressing, systems, users, generally, enter, domain, names, e, g, en, wikipedia, org, instead, of, ip, addresses, because, they, are, easier, to, remember, they, are, converted, by, the, domain, name, system, dns, into, ip, addresses, which, are, more, efficient, for, routing, purposes, internet, protocol, version, 4, ipv4, defines, an, ip, address, as, a, 32, bit, number, ipv4, is, the, initial, version, used, on, the, first, generation, of, the, internet, and, is, still, in, dominant, use, it, was, designed, to, address, up, to, 4, 3, billion, 10, 9, hosts, however, the, explosive, growth, of, the, internet, has, led, to, ipv4, address, exhaustion, which, entered, its, final, stage, in, 2011, when, the, global, ipv4, address, allocation, pool, was, exhausted, because, of, the, growth, of, the, internet, and, the, depletion, of, available, ipv4, addresses, a, new, version, of, ip, ipv6, was, developed, in, the, mid, 1990s, which, provides, vastly, larger, addressing, capabilities, and, more, efficient, routing, of, internet, traffic, ipv6, uses, 128, bits, for, the, ip, address, and, was, standardized, in, 1998, ipv6, deployment, has, been, ongoing, since, the, mid, 2000s, and, is, currently, in, growing, deployment, around, the, world, since, internet, address, registries, rirs, began, to, urge, all, resource, managers, to, plan, rapid, adoption, and, conversion, ipv6, is, not, directly, interoperable, by, design, with, ipv4, in, essence, it, establishes, a, parallel, version, of, the, internet, not, directly, accessible, with, ipv4, software, thus, translation, facilities, must, exist, for, internetworking, or, nodes, must, have, duplicate, networking, software, for, both, networks, essentially, all, modern, computer, operating, systems, support, both, versions, of, the, internet, protocol, network, infrastructure, however, has, been, lagging, in, this, development, aside, from, the, complex, array, of, physical, connections, that, make, up, its, infrastructure, the, internet, is, facilitated, by, bi, or, multi, lateral, commercial, contracts, e, g, peering, agreements, and, by, technical, specifications, or, protocols, that, describe, the, exchange, of, data, over, the, network, indeed, the, internet, is, defined, by, its, interconnections, and, routing, policies, a, subnetwork, or, subnet, is, a, logical, subdivision, of, an, ip, network, 1, 16, the, practice, of, dividing, a, network, into, two, or, more, networks, is, called, subnetting, computers, that, belong, to, a, subnet, are, addressed, with, an, identical, most, significant, bit, group, in, their, ip, addresses, this, results, in, the, logical, division, of, an, ip, address, into, two, fields, the, network, number, or, routing, prefix, and, the, rest, field, or, host, identifier, the, rest, field, is, an, identifier, for, a, specific, host, or, network, interface, the, routing, prefix, may, be, expressed, in, classless, inter, domain, routing, cidr, notation, written, as, the, first, address, of, a, network, followed, by, a, slash, character, and, ending, with, the, bit, length, of, the, prefix, for, example, 198, 51, 100, 0, 24, is, the, prefix, of, the, internet, protocol, version, 4, network, starting, at, the, given, address, having, 24, bits, allocated, for, the, network, prefix, and, the, remaining, 8, bits, reserved, for, host, addressing, addresses, in, the, range, 198, 51, 100, 0, to, 198, 51, 100, 255, belong, to, this, network, the, ipv6, address, specification, 2001, db8, 32, is, a, large, address, block, with, 2, 96, addresses, having, a, 32, bit, routing, prefix, for, ipv4, a, network, may, also, be, characterized, by, its, subnet, mask, or, netmask, which, is, the, bitmask, that, when, applied, by, a, bitwise, and, operation, to, any, ip, address, in, the, network, yields, the, routing, prefix, subnet, masks, are, also, expressed, in, dot, decimal, notation, like, an, address, for, example, 255, 255, 255, 0, is, the, subnet, mask, for, the, prefix, 198, 51, 100, 0, 24, traffic, is, exchanged, between, subnetworks, through, routers, when, the, routing, prefixes, of, the, source, address, and, the, destination, address, differ, a, router, serves, as, a, logical, or, physical, boundary, between, the, subnets, the, benefits, of, subnetting, an, existing, network, vary, with, each, deployment, scenario, in, the, address, allocation, architecture, of, the, internet, using, cidr, and, in, large, organizations, it, is, necessary, to, allocate, address, space, efficiently, subnetting, may, also, enhance, routing, efficiency, or, have, advantages, in, network, management, when, subnetworks, are, administratively, controlled, by, different, entities, in, a, larger, organization, subnets, may, be, arranged, logically, in, a, hierarchical, architecture, partitioning, an, organization, s, network, address, space, into, a, tree, like, routing, structure, computers, and, routers, use, routing, tables, in, their, operating, system, to, direct, ip, packets, to, reach, a, node, on, a, different, subnetwork, routing, tables, are, maintained, by, manual, configuration, or, automatically, by, routing, protocols, end, nodes, typically, use, a, default, route, that, points, toward, an, isp, providing, transit, while, isp, routers, use, the, border, gateway, protocol, to, establish, the, most, efficient, routing, across, the, complex, connections, of, the, global, internet, the, default, gateway, is, the, node, that, serves, as, the, forwarding, host, router, to, other, networks, when, no, other, route, specification, matches, the, destination, ip, address, of, a, packet, while, the, hardware, components, in, the, internet, infrastructure, can, often, be, used, to, support, other, software, systems, it, is, the, design, and, the, standardization, process, of, the, software, that, characterizes, the, internet, and, provides, the, foundation, for, its, scalability, and, success, the, responsibility, for, the, architectural, design, of, the, internet, software, systems, has, been, assumed, by, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, the, ietf, conducts, standard, setting, work, groups, open, to, any, individual, about, the, various, aspects, of, internet, architecture, the, resulting, contributions, and, standards, are, published, as, request, for, comments, rfc, documents, on, the, ietf, web, site, the, principal, methods, of, networking, that, enable, the, internet, are, contained, in, specially, designated,

users, worldwide, have, easy, instant, access, to, a, vast, and, diverse, amount, of, online, information, compared, to, printed, media, books, encyclopedias, and, traditional, libraries, the, world, wide, web, has, enabled, the, decentralization, of, information, on, a, large, scale, the, web, has, enabled, individuals, and, organizations, to, publish, ideas, and, information, to, a, potentially, large, audience, online, at, greatly, reduced, expense, and, time, delay, publishing, a, web, page, a, blog, or, building, a, website, involves, little, initial, cost, and, many, cost, free, services, are, available, however, publishing, and, maintaining, large, professional, web, sites, with, attractive, diverse, and, up, to, date, information, is, still, a, difficult, and, expensive, proposition, many, individuals, and, some, companies, and, groups, use, web, logs, or, blogs, which, are, largely, used, as, easily, updatable, online, diaries, some, commercial, organizations, encourage, staff, to, communicate, advice, in, their, areas, of, specialization, in, the, hope, that, visitors, will, be, impressed, by, the, expert, knowledge, and, free, information, and, be, attracted, to, the, corporation, as, a, result, advertising, on, popular, web, pages, can, be, lucrative, and, e, commerce, which, is, the, sale, of, products, and, services, directly, via, the, web, continues, to, grow, online, advertising, is, a, form, of, marketing, and, advertising, which, uses, the, internet, to, deliver, promotional, marketing, messages, to, consumers, it, includes, email, marketing, search, engine, marketing, sem, social, media, marketing, many, types, of, display, advertising, including, web, banner, advertising, and, mobile, advertising, in, 2011, internet, advertising, revenues, in, the, united, states, surpassed, those, of, cable, television, and, nearly, exceeded, those, of, broadcast, television, 19, many, common, online, advertising, practices, are, controversial, and, increasingly, subject, to, regulation, when, the, web, developed, in, the, 1990s, a, typical, web, page, was, stored, in, completed, form, on, a, web, server, formatted, in, html, ready, for, transmission, to, a, web, browser, in, response, to, a, request, over, time, the, process, of, creating, and, serving, web, pages, has, become, dynamic, creating, a, flexible, design, layout, and,

predates, the, creation, of, the, internet, pictures, documents, and, other, files, are, sent, as, email, attachments, email, messages, can, be, cc, ed, to, multiple, email, addresses, internet, telephony, is, a, common, communications, service, realized, with, the, internet, the, name, of, the, principal, internetworking, protocol, the, internet, protocol, lends, its, name, to, voice, over, internet, protocol, voip, the, idea, began, in, the, early, 1990s, with, walkie, talkie, like, voice, applications, for, personal, computers, voip, systems, now, dominate, many, markets, and, are, as, easy, to, use, and, as, convenient, as, a, traditional, telephone, the, benefit, has, been, substantial, cost, savings, over, traditional, telephone, calls, especially, over, long, distances, cable, adsl, and, mobile, data, networks, provide, internet, access, in, customer, premises, and, inexpensive, voip, network, adapters, provide, the, connection, for, traditional, analog, telephone, sets, the, voice, quality, of, voip, often, exceeds, that, of, traditional, calls, remaining, problems, for, voip, include, the, situation, that, emergency, services, may, not, be, universally, available, and, that, devices, rely, on, a, local, power, supply, while, older, traditional, phones, are, powered, from, the, local, loop, and, typically, operate, during, a, power, failure, file, sharing, is, an, example, of, transferring, large, amounts, of, data, across, the, internet, a, computer, file, can, be, emailed, to, customers, colleagues, and, friends, as, an, attachment, it, can, be, uploaded, to, a, website, or, file, transfer, protocol, ftp, server, for, easy, download, by, others, it, can, be, put, into, a, shared, location, or, onto, a, file, server, for, instant, use, by, colleagues, the, load, of, bulk, downloads, to, many, users, can, be, eased, by, the, use, of, mirror, servers, or, peer, to, peer, networks, in, any, of, these, cases, access, to, the, file, may, be, controlled, by, user, authentication, the, transit, of, the, file, over, the, internet, may, be, obscured, by, encryption, and, money, may, change, hands, for, access, to, the, file, the, price, can, be, paid, by, the, remote, charging, of, funds, from, for, example, a, credit, card, whose, details, are, also, passed, usually, fully, encrypted, across, the, internet, the, origin, and, authenticity, of, the, file, received, may, be, checked, by, digital, signatures, or, by, md5, or, other, message, digests, these, simple, features, of, the, internet, over, a, worldwide, basis, are, changing, the, production, sale, and, distribution, of, anything, that, can, be, reduced, to, a, computer, file, for, transmission, this, includes, all, manner, of, print, publications, software, products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics, and, the, other, arts, this, in, turn, has, caused, seismic, shifts, in, each, of, the, existing, industries, that, previously, controlled, the, production, and, distribution, of, these, products, streaming, media, is, the, real, time, delivery, of, digital, media, for, immediate, consumption, or, enjoyment, by, end, users, many, radio, and, television, broadcasters, provide, internet, feeds, of, their, live, audio, and, video, productions, they, may, also, allow, time, shift, viewing, or, listening, such, as, preview, classic, clips, and, listen, again, features, these, providers, have, been, joined, by, a, range, of, pure, internet, broadcasters, who, never, had, on, air, licenses, this, means, that, an, internet, connected, device, such, as, a, computer, or, something, more, specific, can, be, used, to, access, online, media, in, much, the, same, way, as, was, previously, possible, only, with, a, television, or, radio, receiver, the, range, of, available, types, of, content, is, much, wider, from, specialized, technical, webcasts, to, on, demand, popular, multimedia, services, podcasting, is, a, variation, on, this, theme, where, usually, audio, material, is, downloaded, and, played, back, on, a, computer, or, shifted, to, a, portable, media, player, to, be, listened, to, on, the, move, these, techniques, using, simple, equipment, allow, anybody, with, little, censorship, or, licensing, control, to, broadcast, audio, visual, material, worldwide, digital, media, streaming, increases, the, demand, for, network, bandwidth, for, example, standard, image, quality, needs, 1, mbit, s, link, speed, for, sd, 480p, hd, 720p, quality, requires, 2, 5, mbit, s, and, the, top, of, the, line, hdx, quality, needs, 4, 5, mbit, s, for, 1080p, webcams, are, a, low, cost, extension, of, this, phenomenon, while, some, webcams, can, give, full, frame, rate, video, the, picture, either, is, usually, small, or, updates, slowly, internet, users, can, watch, animals, around, an, african, waterhole, ships, in, the, panama, canal, traffic, at, a, local, roundabout, or, monitor, their, own, premises, live, and, in, real, time, video, chat, rooms, and, video, conferencing, are, also, popular, with, many, uses, being, found, for, personal, webcams, with, and, without, two, way, sound, youtube, was, founded, on, 15, february, 2005, and, is, now, the, leading, website, for, free, streaming, video, with, more, than, two, billion, users, it, uses, an, html5, based, web, player, by, default, to, stream, and, show, video, files, registered, users, may, upload, an, unlimited, amount, of, video, and, build, their, own, personal, profile, youtube, claims, that, its, users, watch, hundreds, of, millions, and, upload, hundreds, of, thousands, of, videos, daily, the, internet, has, enabled, new, forms, of, social, interaction, activities, and, social, associations, this, phenomenon, has, given, rise, to, the, scholarly, study, of, the, sociology, of, the, internet, the, early, internet, left, an, impact, on, some, writers, who, used, symbolism, to, write, about, it, such, as, describing, the, internet, as, a, means, to, connect, individuals, in, a, vast, invisible, net, over, all, the, earth, between, 2000, and, 2009, the, number, of, internet, users, globally, rose, from, 390, million, to, 1, 9, billion, by, 2010, 22, of, the, world, s, population, had, access, to, computers, with, 1, billion, google, searches, every, day, 300, million, internet, users, reading, blogs, and, 2, billion, videos, viewed, daily, on, youtube, in, 2014, the, world, s, internet, users, surpassed, 3, billion, or, 44, percent, of, world, population, but, two, thirds, came, from, the, richest, countries, with, 78, percent, of, europeans, using, the, internet, followed, by, 57, percent, of, the, americas, however, by, 2018, asia, alone, accounted, for, 51, of, all, internet, users, with, 2, 2, billion, out, of, the, 4, 3, billion, internet, users, in, the, world, china, s, internet, users, surpassed, a, major, milestone, in, 2018, when, the, country, s, internet, regulatory, authority, china, internet, network, information, centre, announced, that, china, had, 802, million, users, china, was, followed, by, india, with, some, 700, million, users, with, the, united, states, third, with, 275, million, users, however, in, terms, of, penetration, in, 2022, china, had, a, 70, penetration, rate, compared, to, india, s, 60, and, the, united, states, s, 90, in, 2022, 54, of, the, world, s, internet, users, were, based, in, asia, 14, in, europe, 7, in, north, america, 10, in, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, 11, in, africa, 4, in, the, middle, east, and, 1, in, oceania, in, 2019, kuwait, qatar, the, falkland, islands, bermuda, and, iceland, had, the, highest, internet, penetration, by, the, number, of, users, with, 93, or, more, of, the, population, with, access, as, of, 2022, it, was, estimated, that, 5, 4, billion, people, use, the, internet, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, population, the, prevalent, language, for, communication, via, the, internet, has, always, been, english, this, may, be, a, result, of, the, origin, of, the, internet, as, well, as, the, language, s, role, as, a, lingua, franca, and, as, a, world, language, early, computer, systems, were, limited, to, the, characters, in, the, american, standard, code, for, information, interchange, ascii, a, subset, of, the, latin, alphabet, after, english, 27, the, most, requested, languages, on, the, world, wide, web, are, chinese, 25, spanish, 8, japanese, 5, portuguese, and, german, 4, each, arabic, french, and, russian, 3, each, and, korean, 2, the, internet, s, technologies, have, developed, enough, in, recent, years, especially, in, the, use, of, unicode, that, good, facilities, are, available, for, development, and, communication, in, the, world, s, widely, used, languages, however, some, glitches, such, as, mojibake, incorrect, display, of, some, languages, characters, still, remain, in, a, us, study, in, 2005, the, percentage, of, men, using, the, internet, was, very, slightly, ahead, of, the, percentage, of, women, although, this, difference, reversed, in, those, under, 30, men, logged, on, more, often, spent, more, time, online, and, were, more, likely, to, be, broadband, users, whereas, women, tended, to, make, more, use, of, opportunities, to, communicate, such, as, email, men, were, more, likely, to, use, the, internet, to, pay, bills, participate, in, auctions, and, for, recreation, such, as, downloading, music, and, videos, men, and, women, were, equally, likely, to, use, the, internet, for, shopping, and, banking, in, 2008, women, significantly, outnumbered, men, on, most, social, networking, services, such, as, facebook, and, myspace, although, the, ratios, varied, with, age, women, watched, more, streaming, content, whereas, men, downloaded, more, men, were, more, likely, to, blog, among, those, who, blog, men, were, more, likely, to, have, a, professional, blog, whereas, women, were, more, likely, to, have, a, personal, blog, several, neologisms, exist, that, refer, to, internet, users, netizen, as, in, citizen, of, the, net, refers, to, those, actively, involved, in, improving, online, communities, the, internet, in, general, or, surrounding, political, affairs, and, rights, such, as, free, speech, internaut, refers, to, operators, or, technically, highly, capable, users, of, the, internet, digital, citizen, refers, to, a, person, using, the, internet, in, order, to, engage, in, society, politics, and, government, participation, the, internet, allows, greater, flexibility, in, working, hours, and, location, especially, with, the, spread, of, unmetered, high, speed, connections, the, internet, can, be, accessed, almost, anywhere, by, numerous, means, including, through, mobile, internet, devices, mobile, phones, datacards, handheld, game, consoles, and, cellular, routers, allow, users, to, connect, to, the, internet, wirelessly, within, the, limitations, imposed, by, small, screens, and, other, limited, facilities, of, such, pocket, sized, devices, the, services, of, the, internet, including, email, and, the, web, may, be, available, service, providers, may, restrict, the, services, offered, and, mobile, data, charges, may, be, significantly, higher, than, other, access, methods, educational, material, at, all, levels, from, pre, school, to, post,

literature, through, the, likes, of, google, scholar, for, distance, education, help, with, homework, and, other, assignments, self, guided, learning, whiling, away, spare, time, or, just, looking, up, more, detail, on, an, interesting, fact, it, has, never, been, easier, for, people, to, access, educational, information, at, any, level, from, anywhere, the, internet, in, general, and, the, world, wide, web, in, particular, are, important, enablers, of, both, formal, and, informal, education, further, the, internet, allows, researchers, especially, those, from, the, social, and, behavioral, sciences, to, conduct, research, remotely, via, virtual, laboratories, with, profound, changes, in, reach, and, generalizability, of, findings, as, well, as, in, communication, between, scientists, and, in, the, publication, of, results, the, low, cost, and, nearly, instantaneous, sharing, of, ideas, knowledge, and, skills, have, made, collaborative, work, dramatically, easier, with, the, help, of, collaborative, software, not, only, can, a, group, cheaply, communicate, and, share, ideas, but, the, wide, reach, of, the, internet, allows, such, groups, more, easily, to, form, an, example, of, this, is, the, free, software, movement, which, has, produced, among, other, things, linux, mozilla, firefox, and, openoffice, org, later, forked, into, libreoffice, internet, chat, whether, using, an, irc, chat, room, an, instant, messaging, system, or, a, social, networking, service, allows, colleagues, to, stay, in, touch, in, a, very, convenient, way, while, working, at, their, computers, during, the, day, messages, can, be, exchanged, even, more, quickly, and, conveniently, than, via, email, these, systems, may, allow, files, to, be, exchanged, drawings, and, images, to, be, shared, or, voice, and, video, contact, between, team, members, content, management, systems, allow, collaborating, teams, to, work, on, shared, sets, of, documents, simultaneously, without, accidentally, destroying, each, other, s, work, business, and, project, teams, can, share, calendars, as, well, as, documents, and, other, information, such, collaboration, occurs, in, a, wide, variety, of, areas, including, scientific, research, software, development, conference, planning, political, activism, and, creative, writing, social, and, political, collaboration, is, also, becoming, more, widespread, as, both, internet, access, and, computer, literacy, spread, the, internet, allows, computer, users, to, remotely, access, other, computers, and, information, stores,

from, the, office, it, has, been, referred, to, among, system, administrators, as, the, virtual, private, nightmare, because, it, extends, the, secure, perimeter, of, a, corporate, network, into, remote, locations, and, its, employees, homes, by, late, 2010s, internet, has, been, described, as, the, main, source, of, scientific, information, for, the, majority, of, the, global, north,

their, brands, to, market, to, their, customers, and, to, encourage, posts, to, go, viral, black, hat, social, media, techniques, are, also, employed, by, some, organizations, such, as, spam, accounts, and, astroturfing, a, risk, for, both, individuals, and, organizations, writing, posts, especially, public, posts, on, social, networking, services, is, that, especially, foolish, or, controversial, posts, occasionally, lead, to, an, unexpected, and, possibly, large, scale, backlash, on, social, media, from, other, internet, users, this, is, also, a, risk, in, relation, to, controversial, offline, behavior, if, it, is, widely, made, known, the, nature, of, this, backlash, can, range, widely, from, counter, arguments, and, public, mockery, through, insults, and, hate,

and, twitter, in, particular, has, been, criticized, in, the, past, for, not, doing, enough, to, aid, victims, of, online, abuse, for, organizations, such, a, backlash, can, cause, overall, brand, damage, especially, if, reported, by, the, media, however, this, is, not, always, the, case, as, any, brand, damage, in, the, eyes, of, people, with, an, opposing, opinion, to, that, presented, by, the, organization, could, sometimes, be, outweighed, by, strengthening, the, brand, in, the, eyes, of, others, furthermore, if, an, organization, or, individual, gives, in, to, demands, that, others, perceive, as, wrong, headed, that, can, then, provoke, a, counter, backlash, some, websites, such, as, reddit, have, rules, forbidding, the, posting, of, personal, information, of, individuals, also, known, as, doxxing, due, to, concerns, about, such, postings, leading, to, mobs, of, large, numbers, of, internet, users, directing, harassment, at, the, specific, individuals, thereby, identified, in, particular, the, reddit, rule, forbidding, the, posting, of, personal, information, is, widely, understood, to, imply, that, all, identifying, photos, and, names, must, be, censored, in, facebook, screenshots, posted, to, reddit, however, the, interpretation, of, this, rule, in, relation, to, public, twitter, posts, is, less, clear, and, in, any, case, like, minded, people, online, have, many, other, ways, they, can, use, to, direct, each, other, s, attention, to, public, social, media, posts, they, disagree, with, children, also, face, dangers, online, such, as, cyberbullying, and, approaches, by, sexual, predators, who, sometimes, pose, as, children, themselves, children, may, also, encounter, material, that, they, may, find, upsetting, or, material, that, their, parents,

inappropriate, material, on, the, internet, the, most, popular, social, networking, services, such, as, facebook, and, twitter, commonly, forbid, users, under, the, age, of, 13, however, these, policies, are, typically, trivial, to, circumvent, by, registering, an, account, with, a, false, birth, date, and, a, significant, number, of, children, aged, under, 13, join, such, sites, anyway,

modern, modes, of, online, gaming, began, with, subscription, services, such, as, gamespy, and, mplayer, non, subscribers, were, limited, to, certain, types, of, game, play, or, certain, games, many,
