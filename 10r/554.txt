https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar
the, gregorian, calendar, is, the, calendar, used, in, most, parts, of, the, world, it, went, into, effect, in, october, 1582, following, the, papal, bull, inter, gravissimas, issued, by, pope, gregory, xiii, which, introduced, it, as, a, modification, of, and, replacement, for, the, julian, calendar, the, principal, change, was, to, space, leap, years, differently, so, as, to, make, the, average, calendar, year, 365, 2425, days, long, more, closely, approximating, the, 365, 2422, day, tropical, or, solar, year, that, is, determined, by, the, earth, s, revolution, around, the, sun, the, rule, for, leap, years, is, every, year, that, is, exactly, divisible, by, four, is, a, leap, year, except, for, years, that, are, exactly, divisible, by, 100, but, these, centurial, years, are, leap, years, if, they, are, exactly, divisible, by, 400, for, example, the, years, 1700, 1800, and, 1900, are, not, leap, years, but, the, year, 2000, is, there, were, two, reasons, to, establish, the, gregorian, calendar, first, the, julian, calendar, assumed, incorrectly, that, the, average, solar, year, is, exactly, 365, 25, days, long, an, overestimate, of, a, little, under, one, day, per, century, and, thus, has, a, leap, year, every, four, years, without, exception, the, gregorian, reform, shortened, the, average, calendar, year, by, 0, 0075, days, to, stop, the, drift, of, the, calendar, with, respect, to, the, equinoxes, second, in, the, years, since, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, ad, 325, the, excess, leap, days, introduced, by, the, julian, algorithm, had, caused, the, calendar, to, drift, such, that, the, march, equinox, was, occurring, well, before, its, nominal, 21, march, date, this, date, was, important, to, the, christian, churches, because, it, is, fundamental, to, the, calculation, of, the, date, of, easter, to, reinstate, the, association, the, reform, advanced, the, date, by, 10, days, thursday, 4, october, 1582, was, followed, by, friday, 15, october, 1582, in, addition, the, reform, also, altered, the, lunar, cycle, used, by, the, church, to, calculate, the, date, for, easter, because, astronomical, new, moons, were, occurring, four, days, before, the, calculated, dates, whilst, the, reform, introduced, minor, changes, the, calendar, continued, to, be, fundamentally, based, on, the, same, geocentric, theory, as, its, predecessor, the, reform, was, adopted, initially, by, the, catholic, countries, of, europe, and, their, overseas, possessions, over, the, next, three, centuries, the, protestant, and, eastern, orthodox, countries, also, gradually, moved, to, what, they, called, the, improved, calendar, with, greece, being, the, last, european, country, to, adopt, the, calendar, for, civil, use, only, in, 1923, however, many, orthodox, churches, continue, to, use, the, julian, calendar, for, religious, rites, and, the, dating, of, major, feasts, to, unambiguously, specify, a, date, during, the, transition, period, in, contemporary, documents, or, in, history, texts, both, notations, were, given, tagged, as, old, style, or, new, style, as, appropriate, during, the, 20th, century, most, non, western, countries, also, adopted, the, calendar, at, least, for, civil, purposes, the, gregorian, calendar, like, the, julian, calendar, is, a, solar, calendar, with, 12, months, of, 28, 31, days, each, the, year, in, both, calendars, consists, of, 365, days, with, a, leap, day, being, added, to, february, in, the, leap, years, the, months, and, length, of, months, in, the, gregorian, calendar, are, the, same, as, for, the, julian, calendar, the, only, difference, is, that, the, gregorian, reform, omitted, a, leap, day, in, three, centurial, years, every, 400, years, and, left, the, leap, day, unchanged, a, leap, year, normally, occurs, every, four, years, the, leap, day, historically, was, inserted, by, doubling, 24, february, there, were, indeed, two, days, dated, 24, february, however, for, many, years, it, has, been, customary, to, put, the, extra, day, at, the, end, of, the, month, of, february, adding, a, 29, february, for, the, leap, day, before, the, 1969, revision, of, its, general, roman, calendar, the, catholic, church, delayed, february, feasts, after, the, 23rd, by, one, day, in, leap, years, masses, celebrated, according, to, the, previous, calendar, still, reflect, this, delay, gregorian, years, are, identified, by, consecutive, year, numbers, a, calendar, date, is, fully, specified, by, the, year, numbered, according, to, a, calendar, era, in, this, case, anno, domini, or, common, era, the, month, identified, by, name, or, number, and, the, day, of, the, month, numbered, sequentially, starting, from, 1, although, the, calendar, year, currently, runs, from, 1, january, to, 31, december, at, previous, times, year, numbers, were, based, on, a, different, starting, point, within, the, calendar, see, the, beginning, of, the, year, section, below, calendar, cycles, repeat, completely, every, 400, years, which, equals, 146, 097, days, of, these, 400, years, 303, are, regular, years, of, 365, days, and, 97, are, leap, years, of, 366, days, a, mean, calendar, year, is, 365, 97, 400, days, 365, 2425, days, or, 365, days, 5, hours, 49, minutes, and, 12, seconds, the, gregorian, calendar, was, a, reform, of, the, julian, calendar, it, was, instituted, by, papal, bull, inter, gravissimas, dated, 24, february, 1582, by, pope, gregory, xiii, after, whom, the, calendar, is, named, the, motivation, for, the, adjustment, was, to, bring, the, date, for, the, celebration, of, easter, to, the, time, of, year, in, which, it, was, celebrated, when, it, was, introduced, by, the, early, church, the, error, in, the, julian, calendar, its, assumption, that, there, are, exactly, 365, 25, days, in, a, year, had, led, to, the, date, of, the, equinox, according, to, the, calendar, drifting, from, the, observed, reality, and, thus, an, error, had, been, introduced, into, the, calculation, of, the, date, of, easter, although, a, recommendation, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, specified, that, all, christians, should, celebrate, easter, on, the, same, day, it, took, almost, five, centuries, before, virtually, all, christians, achieved, that, objective, by, adopting, the, rules, of, the, church, of, alexandria, see, easter, for, the, issues, which, arose, because, the, date, of, easter, is, a, function, the, computus, of, the, date, of, the, spring, equinox, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, catholic, church, considered, unacceptable, the, increasing, divergence, between, the, canonical, date, of, the, equinox, and, observed, reality, easter, is, celebrated, on, the, sunday, after, the, ecclesiastical, full, moon, on, or, after, 21, march, which, was, adopted, as, an, approximation, to, the, march, equinox, european, scholars, had, been, well, aware, of, the, calendar, drift, since, the, early, medieval, period, bede, writing, in, the, 8th, century, showed, that, the, accumulated, error, in, his, time, was, more, than, three, days, roger, bacon, in, c, 1200, estimated, the, error, at, seven, or, eight, days, dante, writing, c, 1300, was, aware, of, the, need, for, calendar, reform, an, attempt, to, go, forward, with, such, a, reform, was, undertaken, by, pope, sixtus, iv, who, in, 1475, invited, regiomontanus, to, the, vatican, for, this, purpose, however, the, project, was, interrupted, by, the, death, of, regiomontanus, shortly, after, his, arrival, in, rome, the, increase, of, astronomical, knowledge, and, the, precision, of, observations, towards, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, made, the, question, more, pressing, numerous, publications, over, the, following, decades, called, for, a, calendar, reform, among, them, two, papers, sent, to, the, vatican, by, the, university, of, salamanca, in, 1515, and, 1578, but, the, project, was, not, taken, up, again, until, the, 1540s, and, implemented, only, under, pope, gregory, xiii, r, 1572, 1585, in, 1545, the, council, of, trent, authorised, pope, paul, iii, to, reform, the, calendar, requiring, that, the, date, of, the, vernal, equinox, be, restored, to, that, which, it, held, at, the, time, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, and, that, an, alteration, to, the, calendar, be, designed, to, prevent, future, drift, this, would, allow, for, more, consistent, and, accurate, scheduling, of, the, feast, of, easter, in, 1577, a, compendium, was, sent, to, expert, mathematicians, outside, the, reform, commission, for, comments, some, of, these, experts, including, giambattista, benedetti, and, giuseppe, moleto, believed, easter, should, be, computed, from, the, true, motions, of, the, sun, and, moon, rather, than, using, a, tabular, method, but, these, recommendations, were, not, adopted, the, reform, adopted, was, a, modification, of, a, proposal, made, by, the, calabrian, doctor, aloysius, lilius, or, lilio, lilius, s, proposal, included, reducing, the, number, of, leap, years, in, four, centuries, from, 100, to, 97, by, making, three, out, of, four, centurial, years, common, instead, of, leap, years, he, also, produced, an, original, and, practical, scheme, for, adjusting, the, epacts, of, the, moon, when, calculating, the, annual, date, of, easter, solving, a, long, standing, obstacle, to, calendar, reform, ancient, tables, provided, the, sun, s, mean, longitude, the, german, mathematician, christopher, clavius, the, architect, of, the, gregorian, calendar, noted, that, the, tables, agreed, neither, on, the, time, when, the, sun, passed, through, the, vernal, equinox, nor, on, the, length, of, the, mean, tropical, year, tycho, brahe, also, noticed, discrepancies, the, gregorian, leap, year, rule, 97, leap, years, in, 400, years, was, put, forward, by, petrus, pitatus, of, verona, in, 1560, he, noted, that, it, is, consistent, with, the, tropical, year, of, the, alfonsine, tables, and, with, the, mean, tropical, year, of, copernicus, de, revolutionibus, and, erasmus, reinhold, prutenic, tables, the, three, mean, tropical, years, in, babylonian, sexagesimals, as, the, excess, over, 365, days, the, way, they, would, have, been, extracted, from, the, tables, of, mean, longitude, were, 0, 14, 33, 9, 57, alfonsine, 0, 14, 33, 11, 12, copernicus, and, 0, 14, 33, 9, 24, reinhold, in, decimal, notation, these, are, equal, to, 0, 24254606, 0, 24255185, and, 0, 24254352, respectively, all, values, are, the, same, to, two, sexagesimal, places, 0, 14, 33, equal, to, decimal, 0, 2425, and, this, is, also, the, mean, length, of, the, gregorian, year, thus, pitatus, s, solution, would, have, commended, itself, to, the, astronomers, lilius, s, proposals, had, two, components, first, he, proposed, a, correction, to, the, length, of, the, year, the, mean, tropical, year, is, 365, 24219, days, long, a, commonly, used, value, in, lilius, s, time, from, the, alfonsine, tables, is, 365, 2425463, days, as, the, average, length, of, a, julian, year, is, 365, 25, days, the, julian, year, is, almost, 11, minutes, longer, than, the, mean, tropical, year, the, discrepancy, results, in, a, drift, of, about, three, days, every, 400, years, lilius, s, proposal, resulted, in, an, average, year, of, 365, 2425, days, see, accuracy, at, the, time, of, gregory, s, reform, there, had, already, been, a, drift, of, 10, days, since, the, council, of, nicaea, resulting, in, the, vernal, equinox, falling, on, 10, or, 11, march, instead, of, the, ecclesiastically, fixed, date, of, 21, march, and, if, unreformed, it, would, have, drifted, further, lilius, proposed, that, the, 10, day, drift, should, be, corrected, by, deleting, the, julian, leap, day, on, each, of, its, ten, occurrences, over, a, period, of, forty, years, thereby, providing, for, a, gradual, return, of, the, equinox, to, 21, march, lilius, s, work, was, expanded, upon, by, christopher, clavius, in, a, closely, argued, 800, page, volume, he, would, later, defend, his, and, lilius, s, work, against, detractors, clavius, s, opinion, was, that, the, correction, should, take, place, in, one, move, and, it, was, this, advice, that, prevailed, with, gregory, the, second, component, consisted, of, an, approximation, that, would, provide, an, accurate, yet, simple, rule, based, calendar, lilius, s, formula, was, a, 10, day, correction, to, revert, the, drift, since, the, council, of, nicaea, and, the, imposition, of, a, leap, day, in, only, 97, years, in, 400, rather, than, in, 1, year, in, 4, the, proposed, rule, was, that, years, divisible, by, 100, would, be, leap, years, only, if, they, were, divisible, by, 400, as, well, the, 19, year, cycle, used, for, the, lunar, calendar, required, revision, because, the, astronomical, new, moon, was, at, the, time, of, the, reform, four, days, before, the, calculated, new, moon, it, was, to, be, corrected, by, one, day, every, 300, or, 400, years, 8, times, in, 2500, years, along, with, corrections, for, the, years, that, are, no, longer, leap, years, i, e, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc, in, fact, a, new, method, for, computing, the, date, of, easter, was, introduced, the, method, proposed, by, lilius, was, revised, somewhat, in, the, final, reform, when, the, new, calendar, was, put, in, use, the, error, accumulated, in, the, 13, centuries, since, the, council, of, nicaea, was, corrected, by, a, deletion, of, 10, days, the, julian, calendar, day, thursday, 4, october, 1582, was, followed, by, the, first, day, of, the, gregorian, calendar, friday, 15, october, 1582, the, cycle, of, weekdays, was, not, affected, a, month, after, having, decreed, the, reform, the, pope, with, a, brief, of, 3, april, 1582, granted, to, one, antoni, lilio, the, exclusive, right, to, publish, the, calendar, for, a, period, of, ten, years, the, lunario, novo, secondo, la, nuova, riforma, was, printed, by, vincenzo, accolti, one, of, the, first, calendars, printed, in, rome, after, the, reform, notes, at, the, bottom, that, it, was, signed, with, papal, authorization, and, by, lilio, con, licentia, delli, superiori, et, permissu, ant, onii, lilij, the, papal, brief, was, revoked, on, 20, september, 1582, because, antonio, lilio, proved, unable, to, keep, up, with, the, demand, for, copies, although, gregory, s, reform, was, enacted, in, the, most, solemn, of, forms, available, to, the, church, the, bull, had, no, authority, beyond, the, catholic, church, of, which, he, was, the, supreme, religious, authority, and, the, papal, states, which, he, personally, ruled, the, changes, that, he, was, proposing, were, changes, to, the, civil, calendar, which, required, adoption, by, the, civil, authorities, in, each, country, to, have, legal, effect, the, bull, inter, gravissimas, became, the, law, of, the, catholic, church, in, 1582, but, it, was, not, recognised, by, protestant, churches, eastern, orthodox, churches, oriental, orthodox, churches, and, a, few, others, consequently, the, days, on, which, easter, and, related, holidays, were, celebrated, by, different, christian, churches, again, diverged, on, 29, september, 1582, philip, ii, of, spain, decreed, the, change, from, the, julian, to, the, gregorian, calendar, this, affected, much, of, roman, catholic, europe, as, philip, was, at, the, time, ruler, over, spain, and, portugal, as, well, as, much, of, italy, in, these, territories, as, well, as, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, ruled, by, anna, jagiellon, and, stephen, b, thory, and, in, the, papal, states, the, new, calendar, was, implemented, on, the, date, specified, by, the, bull, with, julian, thursday, 4, october, 1582, being, followed, by, gregorian, friday, 15, october, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonies, followed, somewhat, later, de, facto, because, of, delay, in, communication, the, other, major, catholic, power, of, western, europe, france, adopted, the, change, a, few, months, later, 9, december, was, followed, by, 20, december, many, protestant, countries, initially, objected, to, adopting, a, catholic, innovation, some, protestants, feared, the, new, calendar, was, part, of, a, plot, to, return, them, to, the, catholic, fold, for, example, the, british, could, not, bring, themselves, to, adopt, the, catholic, system, explicitly, the, annexe, to, their, calendar, new, style, act, 1750, established, a, computation, for, the, date, of, easter, that, achieved, the, same, result, as, gregory, s, rules, without, actually, referring, to, him, britain, and, the, british, empire, including, the, eastern, part, of, what, is, now, the, united, states, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, in, 1752, sweden, followed, in, 1753, prior, to, 1917, turkey, used, the, lunar, islamic, calendar, with, the, hijri, era, for, general, purposes, and, the, julian, calendar, for, fiscal, purposes, the, start, of, the, fiscal, year, was, eventually, fixed, at, 1, march, and, the, year, number, was, roughly, equivalent, to, the, hijri, year, see, rumi, calendar, as, the, solar, year, is, longer, than, the, lunar, year, this, originally, entailed, the, use, of, escape, years, every, so, often, when, the, number, of, the, fiscal, year, would, jump, from, 1, march, 1917, the, fiscal, year, became, gregorian, rather, than, julian, on, 1, january, 1926, the, use, of, the, gregorian, calendar, was, extended, to, include, use, for, general, purposes, and, the, number, of, the, year, became, the, same, as, in, most, other, countries, this, section, always, places, the, intercalary, day, on, 29, february, even, though, it, was, always, obtained, by, doubling, 24, february, the, bissextum, twice, sixth, or, bissextile, day, until, the, late, middle, ages, the, gregorian, calendar, is, proleptic, before, 1582, calculated, backwards, on, the, same, basis, for, years, before, 1582, and, the, difference, between, gregorian, and, julian, calendar, dates, increases, by, three, days, every, four, centuries, all, date, ranges, are, inclusive, the, following, equation, gives, the, number, of, days, that, the, gregorian, calendar, is, ahead, of, the, julian, calendar, called, the, secular, difference, between, the, two, calendars, a, negative, difference, means, the, julian, calendar, is, ahead, of, the, gregorian, calendar, d, y, 100, y, 400, 2, displaystyle, d, left, lfloor, y, 100, right, rfloor, left, lfloor, y, 400, right, rfloor, 2, where, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, secular, difference, and, y, displaystyle, y, is, the, year, using, astronomical, year, numbering, that, is, use, 1, year, bc, for, bc, years, x, displaystyle, left, lfloor, x, right, rfloor, means, that, if, the, result, of, the, division, is, not, an, integer, it, is, rounded, down, to, the, nearest, integer, the, general, rule, in, years, which, are, leap, years, in, the, julian, calendar, but, not, the, gregorian, is, up, to, 28, february, in, the, calendar, being, converted, from, add, one, day, less, or, subtract, one, day, more, than, the, calculated, value, give, february, the, appropriate, number, of, days, for, the, calendar, being, converted, into, when, subtracting, days, to, calculate, the, gregorian, equivalent, of, 29, february, julian, 29, february, is, discounted, thus, if, the, calculated, value, is, 4, the, gregorian, equivalent, of, this, date, is, 24, february, the, year, used, in, dates, during, the, roman, republic, and, the, roman, empire, was, the, consular, year, which, began, on, the, day, when, consuls, first, entered, office, probably, 1, may, before, 222, bc, 15, march, from, 222, bc, and, 1, january, from, 153, bc, the, julian, calendar, which, began, in, 45, bc, continued, to, use, 1, january, as, the, first, day, of, the, new, year, even, though, the, year, used, for, dates, changed, the, civil, year, always, displayed, its, months, in, the, order, january, to, december, from, the, roman, republican, period, until, the, present, during, the, middle, ages, under, the, influence, of, the, catholic, church, many, western, european, countries, moved, the, start, of, the, year, to, one, of, several, important, christian, festivals, 25, december, christmas, 25, march, annunciation, or, easter, while, the, byzantine, empire, began, its, year, on, 1, september, and, russia, did, so, on, 1, march, until, 1492, when, the, new, year, was, moved, to, 1, september, in, common, usage, 1, january, was, regarded, as, new, year, s, day, and, celebrated, as, such, but, from, the, 12th, century, until, 1751, the, legal, year, in, england, began, on, 25, march, lady, day, so, for, example, the, parliamentary, record, lists, the, execution, of, charles, i, on, 30, january, as, occurring, in, 1648, as, the, year, did, not, end, until, 24, march, although, later, histories, adjust, the, start, of, the, year, to, 1, january, and, record, the, execution, as, occurring, in, 1649, most, western, european, countries, changed, the, start, of, the, year, to, 1, january, before, they, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, for, example, scotland, changed, the, start, of, the, scottish, new, year, to, 1, january, in, 1600, this, means, that, 1599, was, a, short, year, england, ireland, and, the, british, colonies, changed, the, start, of, the, year, to, 1, january, in, 1752, so, 1751, was, a, short, year, with, only, 282, days, later, in, 1752, in, september, the, gregorian, calendar, was, introduced, throughout, britain, and, the, british, colonies, see, the, section, adoption, these, two, reforms, were, implemented, by, the, calendar, new, style, act, 1750, in, some, countries, an, official, decree, or, law, specified, that, the, start, of, the, year, should, be, 1, january, for, such, countries, a, specific, date, when, a, 1, january, year, became, the, norm, can, be, identified, in, other, countries, the, customs, varied, and, the, start, of, the, year, moved, back, and, forth, as, fashion, and, influence, from, other, countries, dictated, various, customs, neither, the, papal, bull, nor, its, attached, canons, explicitly, fix, such, a, date, though, the, latter, states, that, the, golden, number, of, 1752, ends, in, december, and, a, new, year, and, new, golden, number, begins, in, january, 1753, during, the, period, between, 1582, when, the, first, countries, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, and, 1923, when, the, last, european, country, adopted, it, it, was, often, necessary, to, indicate, the, date, of, some, event, in, both, the, julian, calendar, and, in, the, gregorian, calendar, for, example, 10, 21, february, 1750, 51, where, the, dual, year, accounts, for, some, countries, already, beginning, their, numbered, year, on, 1, january, while, others, were, still, using, some, other, date, even, before, 1582, the, year, sometimes, had, to, be, double, dated, because, of, the, different, beginnings, of, the, year, in, various, countries, woolley, writing, in, his, biography, of, john, dee, 1527, 1608, 9, notes, that, immediately, after, 1582, english, letter, writers, customarily, used, two, dates, on, their, letters, one, os, and, one, ns, old, style, o, s, and, new, style, n, s, indicate, dating, systems, before, and, after, a, calendar, change, respectively, usually, this, is, the, change, from, the, julian, calendar, to, the, gregorian, calendar, as, enacted, in, various, european, countries, between, 1582, and, the, early, 20th, century, in, england, wales, ireland, and, britain, s, american, colonies, there, were, two, calendar, changes, both, in, 1752, the, first, adjusted, the, start, of, a, new, year, from, lady, day, 25, march, to, 1, january, which, scotland, had, done, from, 1600, while, the, second, discarded, the, julian, calendar, in, favour, of, the, gregorian, calendar, removing, 11, days, from, the, september, 1752, calendar, to, do, so, to, accommodate, the, two, calendar, changes, writers, used, dual, dating, to, identify, a, given, day, by, giving, its, date, according, to, both, styles, of, dating, for, countries, such, as, russia, where, no, start, of, year, adjustment, took, place, o, s, and, n, s, simply, indicate, the, julian, and, gregorian, dating, systems, many, eastern, orthodox, countries, continue, to, use, the, older, julian, calendar, for, religious, purposes, extending, the, gregorian, calendar, backwards, to, dates, preceding, its, official, introduction, produces, a, proleptic, calendar, which, should, be, used, with, some, caution, for, ordinary, purposes, the, dates, of, events, occurring, prior, to, 15, october, 1582, are, generally, shown, as, they, appeared, in, the, julian, calendar, with, the, year, starting, on, 1, january, and, no, conversion, to, their, gregorian, equivalents, for, example, the, battle, of, agincourt, is, universally, considered, to, have, been, fought, on, 25, october, 1415, which, is, saint, crispin, s, day, usually, the, mapping, of, new, dates, onto, old, dates, with, a, start, of, year, adjustment, works, well, with, little, confusion, for, events, that, happened, before, the, introduction, of, the, gregorian, calendar, but, for, the, period, between, the, first, introduction, of, the, gregorian, calendar, on, 15, october, 1582, and, its, introduction, in, britain, on, 14, september, 1752, there, can, be, considerable, confusion, between, events, in, continental, western, europe, and, in, british, domains, in, english, language, histories, events, in, continental, western, europe, are, usually, reported, in, english, language, histories, as, happening, under, the, gregorian, calendar, for, example, the, battle, of, blenheim, is, always, given, as, 13, august, 1704, confusion, occurs, when, an, event, affects, both, for, example, william, iii, of, england, set, sail, from, the, netherlands, on, 11, november, 1688, gregorian, calendar, and, arrived, at, brixham, in, england, on, 5, november, 1688, julian, calendar, shakespeare, and, cervantes, seemingly, died, on, exactly, the, same, date, 23, april, 1616, but, cervantes, predeceased, shakespeare, by, ten, days, in, real, time, as, spain, used, the, gregorian, calendar, but, britain, used, the, julian, calendar, this, coincidence, encouraged, unesco, to, make, 23, april, the, world, book, and, copyright, day, astronomers, avoid, this, ambiguity, by, the, use, of, the, julian, day, number, for, dates, before, the, year, 1, unlike, the, proleptic, gregorian, calendar, used, in, the, international, standard, iso, 8601, the, traditional, proleptic, gregorian, calendar, like, the, older, julian, calendar, does, not, have, a, year, 0, and, instead, uses, the, ordinal, numbers, 1, 2, both, for, years, ad, and, bc, thus, the, traditional, time, line, is, 2, bc, 1, bc, ad, 1, and, ad, 2, iso, 8601, uses, astronomical, year, numbering, which, includes, a, year, 0, and, negative, numbers, before, it, thus, the, iso, 8601, time, line, is, 0001, 0000, 0001, and, 0002, the, gregorian, calendar, continued, to, employ, the, julian, months, which, have, latinate, names, and, irregular, numbers, of, days, europeans, sometimes, attempt, to, remember, the, number, of, days, in, each, month, by, memorizing, some, form, of, the, traditional, verse, thirty, days, hath, september, it, appears, in, latin, italian, french, and, portuguese, and, belongs, to, a, broad, oral, tradition, but, the, earliest, currently, attested, form, of, the, poem, is, the, english, marginalia, inserted, into, a, calendar, of, saints, c, 1425, thirti, dayes, hath, novembir, april, june, and, septembir, of, xxviij, is, but, oon, and, alle, the, remenaunt, xxx, and, j, thirty, days, have, november, april, june, and, september, of, 28, is, but, one, and, all, the, remnant, 30, and, 1, variations, appeared, in, mother, goose, and, continue, to, be, taught, at, schools, the, unhelpfulness, of, such, involved, mnemonics, has, been, parodied, as, thirty, days, hath, september, but, all, the, rest, i, can, t, remember, but, it, has, also, been, called, probably, the, only, sixteenth, century, poem, most, ordinary, citizens, know, by, heart, a, common, nonverbal, alternative, is, the, knuckle, mnemonic, considering, the, knuckles, of, one, s, hands, as, months, with, 31, days, and, the, lower, spaces, between, them, as, the, months, with, fewer, days, using, two, hands, one, may, start, from, either, pinkie, knuckle, as, january, and, count, across, omitting, the, space, between, the, index, knuckles, july, and, august, the, same, procedure, can, be, done, using, the, knuckles, of, a, single, hand, returning, from, the, last, july, to, the, first, august, and, continuing, through, a, similar, mnemonic, is, to, move, up, a, piano, keyboard, in, semitones, from, an, f, key, taking, the, white, keys, as, the, longer, months, and, the, black, keys, as, the, shorter, ones, in, conjunction, with, the, system, of, months, there, is, a, system, of, weeks, a, physical, or, electronic, calendar, provides, conversion, from, a, given, date, to, the, weekday, and, shows, multiple, dates, for, a, given, weekday, and, month, calculating, the, day, of, the, week, is, not, very, simple, because, of, the, irregularities, in, the, gregorian, system, when, the, gregorian, calendar, was, adopted, by, each, country, the, weekly, cycle, continued, uninterrupted, for, example, in, the, case, of, the, few, countries, that, adopted, the, reformed, calendar, on, the, date, proposed, by, gregory, xiii, for, the, calendar, s, adoption, friday, 15, october, 1582, the, preceding, date, was, thursday, 4, october, 1582, julian, calendar, opinions, vary, about, the, numbering, of, the, days, of, the, week, iso, 8601, in, common, use, worldwide, starts, with, monday, 1, printed, monthly, calendar, grids, often, list, mondays, in, the, first, left, column, of, dates, and, sundays, in, the, last, in, north, america, the, week, typically, begins, on, sunday, and, ends, on, saturday, the, gregorian, calendar, improves, the, approximation, made, by, the, julian, calendar, by, skipping, three, julian, leap, days, in, every, 400, years, giving, an, average, year, of, 365, 2425, mean, solar, days, long, this, approximation, has, an, error, of, about, one, day, per, 3, 030, years, with, respect, to, the, current, value, of, the, mean, tropical, year, however, because, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, which, is, not, constant, and, the, movement, of, the, perihelion, which, affects, the, earth, s, orbital, speed, the, error, with, respect, to, the, astronomical, vernal, equinox, is, variable, using, the, average, interval, between, vernal, equinoxes, near, 2000, of, 365, 24237, days, implies, an, error, closer, to, 1, day, every, 7, 700, years, by, any, criterion, the, gregorian, calendar, is, substantially, more, accurate, than, the, 1, day, in, 128, years, error, of, the, julian, calendar, average, year, 365, 25, days, in, the, 19th, century, sir, john, herschel, proposed, a, modification, to, the, gregorian, calendar, with, 969, leap, days, every, 4, 000, years, instead, of, 970, leap, days, that, the, gregorian, calendar, would, insert, over, the, same, period, this, would, reduce, the, average, year, to, 365, 24225, days, herschel, s, proposal, would, make, the, year, 4000, and, multiples, thereof, common, instead, of, leap, while, this, modification, has, often, been, proposed, since, it, has, never, been, officially, adopted, on, time, scales, of, thousands, of, years, the, gregorian, calendar, falls, behind, the, astronomical, seasons, this, is, because, the, earth, s, speed, of, rotation, is, gradually, slowing, down, which, makes, each, day, slightly, longer, over, time, see, tidal, acceleration, and, leap, second, while, the, year, maintains, a, more, uniform, duration, this, image, shows, the, difference, between, the, gregorian, calendar, and, the, astronomical, seasons, the, y, axis, is, the, date, in, june, and, the, x, axis, is, gregorian, calendar, years, each, point, is, the, date, and, time, of, the, june, solstice, in, that, particular, year, the, error, shifts, by, about, a, quarter, of, a, day, per, year, centurial, years, are, ordinary, years, unless, they, are, divisible, by, 400, in, which, case, they, are, leap, years, this, causes, a, correction, in, the, years, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and, 2300, for, instance, these, corrections, cause, 23, december, 1903, to, be, the, latest, december, solstice, and, 20, december, 2096, to, be, the, earliest, solstice, about, 2, 35, days, of, variation, compared, with, the, astronomical, event, the, following, are, proposed, reforms, of, the, gregorian, calendar, precursors, of, the, gregorian, reform
