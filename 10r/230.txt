a, qanat, or, k, r, z, is, a, system, for, transporting, water, from, an, aquifer, or, well, to, the, surface, through, an, underground, aqueduct, the, system, originated, approximately, 3, 000, years, ago, in, iran, the, function, is, essentially, the, same, across, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, but, the, system, operates, under, a, variety, of, regional, names, qanat, or, k, r, z, in, iran, karez, in, afghanistan, and, pakistan, foggara, in, algeria, qanat, in, malta, khettara, in, morocco, falaj, in, oman, and, the, united, arab, emirates, and, uy, n, in, saudi, arabia, etc, the, largest, extant, and, functional, qanat, systems, are, located, in, afghanistan, algeria, iran, oman, pakistan, and, the, oases, of, the, turfan, region, in, xinjiang, northwestern, china, this, is, a, system, of, water, supply, that, allows, water, to, be, transported, over, long, distances, in, hot, dry, climates, without, losing, much, of, the, water, to, evaporation, the, system, has, the, advantage, of, being, resistant, to, natural, disasters, such, as, floods, and, to, deliberate, destruction, in, war, furthermore, it, is, almost, insensitive, to, the, levels, of, precipitation, delivering, a, flow, with, only, gradual, variations, from, wet, to, dry, years, karez, are, constructed, as, a, series, of, well, like, vertical, shafts, connected, by, a, gently, sloping, tunnel, this, taps, into, underground, water, and, delivers, it, to, the, surface, by, gravity, without, need, for, pumping, the, vertical, shafts, along, the, underground, channel, are, for, maintenance, purposes, and, water, is, typically, used, only, once, it, emerges, from, the, daylight, point, the, qanats, still, create, a, reliable, supply, of, water, for, human, settlements, and, irrigation, in, hot, arid, and, semi, arid, climates, but, the, value, of, this, system, is, directly, related, to, the, quality, volume, and, regularity, of, the, groundwater, much, of, the, population, of, iran, and, other, arid, countries, in, north, africa, and, west, asia, historically, depended, upon, the, water, from, qanats, many, populated, areas, are, close, to, the, areas, where, qanats, are, possible, common, variants, of, qanat, in, english, include, kanat, khanat, kunut, kona, konait, ghanat, ghundat, qan, h, is, an, arabic, word, that, means, channel, in, persian, the, words, for, qanat, are, k, r, z, or, k, r, z, and, is, derived, from, earlier, word, k, hr, z, the, word, qan, t, is, also, used, in, persian, other, names, for, qanat, include, kahan, persian, kahn, balochi, kahriz, k, hriz, azerbaijan, khettara, morocco, galer, as, minas, or, viajes, de, agua, spain, falaj, arabic, united, arab, emirates, and, oman, foggara, fughara, north, africa, alternative, terms, for, qanats, in, asia, and, north, africa, are, kakuriz, chin, avulz, and, mayun, according, to, most, sources, qanat, technology, was, developed, in, ancient, iran, by, the, persians, sometime, in, the, early, 1st, millennium, bce, and, slowly, spread, westward, and, eastward, from, there, other, sources, suggest, a, southeast, arabian, origin, analogous, systems, appear, to, have, been, developed, independently, in, china, and, in, south, america, specifically, southern, peru, a, cotton, species, gossypium, arboreum, is, indigenous, to, south, asia, and, has, been, cultivated, on, the, indian, subcontinent, for, a, long, time, cotton, appears, in, the, inquiry, into, plants, by, theophrastus, and, is, mentioned, in, the, laws, of, manu, as, transregional, trade, networks, expanded, and, intensified, cotton, spread, from, its, homeland, to, india, and, into, the, middle, east, one, theory, is, that, the, qanat, was, developed, to, irrigate, cotton, fields, first, in, what, is, now, iran, where, it, doubled, the, amount, of, available, water, for, irrigation, and, urban, use, because, of, this, persia, enjoyed, larger, surpluses, of, agricultural, products, thus, increasing, urbanization, and, social, stratification, the, qanat, technology, subsequently, spread, from, persia, westward, and, eastward, in, the, arid, coastal, desert, of, peru, a, technology, of, water, supply, similar, to, that, of, the, qanats, called, puquios, was, developed, most, archaeologists, believe, that, the, puquios, are, indigenous, and, date, to, about, 500, ce, but, a, few, believe, they, are, of, spanish, origin, brought, to, the, americas, in, the, 16th, century, puquios, were, still, in, use, in, the, nazca, region, in, the, 21st, century, in, arid, and, semi, arid, regions, owing, to, high, evaporation, transportation, routes, were, in, the, form, of, qanats, which, led, groundwater, to, consumption, areas, along, underground, tunnels, in, the, long, run, the, qanat, system, is, not, only, economical, but, also, sustainable, for, irrigation, and, agricultural, purposes, the, ground, water, flow, was, known, to, depend, on, grain, size, of, sediments, and, therefore, the, tunnels, in, qanats, are, filled, in, with, coarser, material, than, the, surrounding, host, geological, formations, the, qanats, are, constructed, mainly, along, the, valleys, where, quaternary, sediments, are, deposited, qanats, are, constructed, as, a, series, of, well, like, vertical, shafts, connected, by, a, gently, sloping, tunnel, which, carries, a, water, canal, qanats, efficiently, deliver, large, amounts, of, subterranean, water, to, the, surface, without, need, for, pumping, the, water, drains, by, gravity, typically, from, an, upland, aquifer, with, the, destination, lower, than, the, source, qanats, allow, water, to, be, transported, over, long, distances, in, hot, dry, climates, without, much, water, loss, to, evaporation, it, is, very, common, for, a, qanat, to, start, below, the, foothills, of, mountains, where, the, water, table, is, closest, to, the, surface, from, this, source, the, qanat, tunnel, slopes, gently, downward, slowly, converging, with, the, steeper, slope, of, the, land, surface, above, and, the, water, finally, flows, out, above, ground, where, the, two, levels, meet, to, connect, a, populated, or, agricultural, area, with, an, aquifer, qanats, must, often, extend, for, long, distances, qanats, are, sometimes, split, into, an, underground, distribution, network, of, smaller, canals, called, kariz, like, qanats, these, smaller, canals, are, below, ground, to, avoid, contamination, and, evaporation, in, some, cases, water, from, a, qanat, is, stored, in, a, reservoir, typically, with, night, flow, stored, for, daytime, use, an, ab, anbar, is, an, example, of, a, traditional, persian, qanat, fed, reservoir, for, drinking, water, the, qanat, system, has, the, advantage, of, being, resistant, to, natural, disasters, such, as, floods, and, to, deliberate, destruction, in, war, furthermore, it, is, almost, insensitive, to, the, levels, of, precipitation, delivering, a, flow, with, only, gradual, variations, from, wet, to, dry, years, from, a, sustainability, perspective, qanats, are, powered, only, by, gravity, and, thus, have, low, operation, and, maintenance, costs, qanats, transfer, fresh, water, from, the, mountain, plateau, to, the, lower, lying, plains, with, saltier, soil, this, helps, to, control, soil, salinity, and, prevent, desertification, the, qanat, should, not, be, confused, with, the, spring, flow, tunnel, typical, to, the, mountainous, area, around, jerusalem, although, both, are, excavated, tunnels, designed, to, extract, water, by, gravity, flow, there, are, crucial, differences, firstly, the, origin, of, the, qanat, was, a, well, that, was, turned, into, an, artificial, spring, in, contrast, the, origin, of, the, spring, flow, tunnel, was, the, development, of, a, natural, spring, to, renew, or, increase, flow, following, a, recession, of, the, water, table, secondly, the, shafts, essential, for, the, construction, of, qanats, are, not, essential, to, spring, flow, tunnels, a, typical, town, or, city, in, iran, and, elsewhere, where, the, qanat, is, used, has, more, than, one, qanat, fields, and, gardens, are, located, both, over, the, qanats, a, short, distance, before, they, emerge, from, the, ground, and, below, the, surface, outlet, water, from, the, qanats, define, both, the, social, regions, in, the, city, and, the, layout, of, the, city, the, water, is, freshest, cleanest, and, coolest, in, the, upper, reaches, and, more, prosperous, people, live, at, the, outlet, or, immediately, upstream, of, the, outlet, when, the, qanat, is, still, below, ground, the, water, is, drawn, to, the, surface, via, wells, or, animal, driven, persian, wells, private, subterranean, reservoirs, could, supply, houses, and, buildings, for, domestic, use, and, garden, irrigation, as, well, air, flow, from, the, qanat, is, used, to, cool, an, underground, summer, room, shabestan, found, in, many, older, houses, and, buildings, downstream, of, the, outlet, the, water, runs, through, surface, canals, called, jubs, j, bs, which, run, downhill, with, lateral, branches, to, carry, water, to, the, neighborhood, gardens, and, fields, the, streets, normally, parallel, the, jubs, and, their, lateral, branches, as, a, result, the, cities, and, towns, are, oriented, consistent, with, the, gradient, of, the, land, this, is, a, practical, response, to, efficient, water, distribution, over, varying, terrain, the, lower, reaches, of, the, canals, are, less, desirable, for, both, residences, and, agriculture, the, water, grows, progressively, more, polluted, as, it, passes, downstream, in, dry, years, the, lower, reaches, are, the, most, likely, to, see, substantial, reductions, in, flow, traditionally, qanats, are, built, by, a, group, of, skilled, laborers, muqann, s, with, hand, labor, the, profession, historically, paid, well, and, was, typically, handed, down, from, father, to, son, the, critical, initial, step, in, qanat, construction, is, identification, of, an, appropriate, water, source, the, search, begins, at, the, point, where, the, alluvial, fan, meets, the, mountains, or, foothills, water, is, more, abundant, in, the, mountains, because, of, orographic, lifting, and, excavation, in, the, alluvial, fan, is, relatively, easy, the, muqann, s, follow, the, track, of, the, main, water, courses, coming, from, the, mountains, or, foothills, to, identify, evidence, of, subsurface, water, such, as, deep, rooted, vegetation, or, seasonal, seeps, a, trial, well, is, then, dug, to, determine, the, depth, of, the, water, table, and, determine, whether, a, sufficient, flow, is, available, to, justify, construction, if, these, prerequisites, are, met, the, route, is, laid, out, aboveground, equipment, must, be, assembled, the, equipment, is, straightforward, containers, usually, leather, bags, ropes, reels, to, raise, the, container, to, the, surface, at, the, shaft, head, hatchets, and, shovels, for, excavation, lights, and, spirit, levels, or, plumb, bobs, and, string, depending, upon, the, soil, type, qanat, liners, usually, fired, clay, hoops, may, also, be, required, although, the, construction, methods, are, simple, the, construction, of, a, qanat, requires, a, detailed, understanding, of, subterranean, geology, and, a, degree, of, engineering, sophistication, the, gradient, of, the, qanat, must, be, carefully, controlled, too, shallow, a, gradient, yields, no, flow, and, too, steep, a, gradient, will, result, in, excessive, erosion, collapsing, the, qanat, and, misreading, the, soil, conditions, leads, to, collapses, which, at, best, require, extensive, rework, and, at, worst, are, fatal, for, the, crew, construction, of, a, qanat, is, usually, performed, by, a, crew, of, 3, 4, muqann, s, for, a, shallow, qanat, one, worker, typically, digs, the, horizontal, shaft, one, raises, the, excavated, earth, from, the, shaft, and, one, distributes, the, excavated, earth, at, the, top, the, crew, typically, begins, from, the, destination, to, which, the, water, will, be, delivered, into, the, soil, and, works, toward, the, source, the, test, well, vertical, shafts, are, excavated, along, the, route, separated, at, a, distance, of, 20, 35, m, 66, 115, ft, the, separation, of, the, shafts, is, a, balance, between, the, amount, of, work, required, to, excavate, them, and, the, amount, of, effort, required, to, excavate, the, space, between, them, as, well, as, the, ultimate, maintenance, effort, in, general, the, shallower, the, qanat, the, closer, the, vertical, shafts, if, the, qanat, is, long, excavation, may, begin, from, both, ends, at, once, tributary, channels, are, sometimes, also, constructed, to, supplement, the, water, flow, most, qanats, in, iran, run, less, than, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, while, some, have, been, measured, at, 70, km, 43, mi, in, length, near, kerman, the, vertical, shafts, usually, range, from, 20, to, 200, m, 66, to, 656, ft, in, depth, although, qanats, in, the, province, of, khorasan, have, been, recorded, with, vertical, shafts, of, up, to, 275, m, 902, ft, the, vertical, shafts, support, construction, and, maintenance, of, the, underground, channel, as, well, as, air, interchange, deep, shafts, require, intermediate, platforms, to, facilitate, the, process, of, removing, soil, the, construction, speed, depends, on, the, depth, and, nature, of, the, ground, if, the, earth, is, soft, and, easy, to, work, at, 20, m, 66, ft, depth, a, crew, of, four, workers, can, excavate, a, horizontal, length, of, 40, m, 130, ft, per, day, when, the, vertical, shaft, reaches, 40, m, 130, ft, they, can, excavate, only, 20, meters, horizontally, per, day, and, at, 60, m, 200, ft, in, depth, this, drops, below, 5, horizontal, meters, per, day, in, algeria, a, common, speed, is, just, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, per, day, at, a, depth, of, 15, m, 49, ft, deep, long, qanats, which, many, are, require, years, and, even, decades, to, construct, the, excavated, material, is, usually, transported, by, means, of, leather, bags, up, the, vertical, shafts, it, is, mounded, around, the, vertical, shaft, exit, providing, a, barrier, that, prevents, windblown, or, rain, driven, debris, from, entering, the, shafts, these, mounds, may, be, covered, to, provide, further, protection, to, the, qanat, from, the, air, these, shafts, look, like, a, string, of, bomb, craters, the, qanat, s, water, carrying, channel, must, have, a, sufficient, downward, slope, that, water, flows, easily, however, the, downward, gradient, must, not, be, so, great, as, to, create, conditions, under, which, the, water, transitions, between, supercritical, and, subcritical, flow, if, this, occurs, the, waves, that, result, can, result, in, severe, erosion, that, can, damage, or, destroy, the, qanat, the, choice, of, the, slope, is, a, trade, off, between, erosion, and, sedimentation, highly, sloped, tunnels, are, subject, to, more, erosion, as, water, flows, at, a, higher, speed, on, the, other, hand, less, sloped, tunnels, need, frequent, maintenance, due, to, the, problem, of, sedimentation, a, lower, downward, gradient, also, contributes, to, reducing, the, solid, contents, and, contamination, in, water, in, shorter, qanats, the, downward, gradient, varies, between, 1, 1000, and, 1, 1500, while, in, longer, qanats, it, may, be, almost, horizontal, such, precision, is, routinely, obtained, with, a, spirit, level, and, string, in, cases, where, the, gradient, is, steeper, underground, waterfalls, may, be, constructed, with, appropriate, design, features, usually, linings, to, absorb, the, energy, with, minimal, erosion, in, some, cases, the, water, power, has, been, harnessed, to, drive, underground, mills, if, it, is, not, possible, to, bring, the, outlet, of, the, qanat, out, near, the, settlement, it, is, necessary, to, run, a, jub, or, canal, overground, this, is, avoided, when, possible, to, limit, pollution, warming, and, water, loss, due, to, evaporation, the, vertical, shafts, may, be, covered, to, minimize, blown, in, sand, the, channels, of, qanats, must, be, periodically, inspected, for, erosion, or, cave, ins, cleaned, of, sand, and, mud, and, otherwise, repaired, for, safety, air, flow, must, be, assured, before, entry, some, damaged, qanats, have, been, restored, to, be, sustainable, restoration, needs, to, take, into, account, many, nontechnical, factors, beginning, with, the, process, of, selecting, the, qanat, to, be, restored, in, syria, three, sites, were, chosen, based, on, a, national, inventory, conducted, in, 2001, one, of, them, the, drasiah, qanat, of, dmeir, was, completed, in, 2002, selection, criteria, included, the, availability, of, a, steady, groundwater, flow, social, cohesion, and, willingness, to, contribute, of, the, community, using, the, qanat, and, the, existence, of, a, functioning, water, rights, system, the, primary, applications, of, qanats, are, for, irrigation, providing, cattle, with, water, and, drinking, water, supply, other, applications, include, watermills, cooling, and, ice, storage, watermills, within, a, qanat, system, had, to, be, carefully, situated, to, make, best, use, of, the, slow, flow, of, water, in, iran, there, were, subterranean, mills, at, yazd, and, boshruyeh, at, taft, and, ardestan, mills, were, placed, at, the, outflow, from, the, qanat, before, irrigation, of, the, fields, qanats, used, in, conjunction, with, a, wind, tower, can, provide, cooling, as, well, as, a, water, supply, a, wind, tower, is, a, chimney, like, structure, positioned, above, the, house, of, its, four, openings, the, one, opposite, the, wind, direction, is, opened, to, move, air, out, of, the, house, incoming, air, is, pulled, from, a, qanat, below, the, house, the, air, flow, across, the, vertical, shaft, opening, creates, a, lower, pressure, see, bernoulli, effect, and, draws, cool, air, up, from, the, qanat, tunnel, mixing, with, it, the, air, from, the, qanat, is, drawn, into, the, tunnel, at, some, distance, away, and, is, cooled, both, by, contact, with, the, cool, tunnel, walls, water, and, by, the, transfer, of, latent, heat, of, evaporation, as, water, evaporates, into, the, air, stream, in, dry, desert, climates, this, can, result, in, a, greater, than, 15, c, reduction, in, the, air, temperature, coming, from, the, qanat, the, mixed, air, still, feels, dry, so, the, basement, is, cool, and, only, comfortably, moist, not, damp, wind, tower, and, qanat, cooling, have, been, used, in, desert, climates, for, over, 1, 000, years, by, 400, bce, persian, engineers, had, mastered, the, technique, of, storing, ice, in, the, middle, of, summer, in, the, desert, the, ice, could, be, brought, in, during, the, winters, from, nearby, mountains, but, in, a, more, usual, and, sophisticated, method, they, built, a, wall, in, the, east, west, direction, near, a, yakhchal, ice, pit, in, winter, the, qanat, water, would, be, channeled, to, the, north, side, of, the, wall, whose, shade, made, the, water, freeze, more, quickly, increasing, the, ice, formed, per, winter, day, then, the, ice, was, stored, in, yakhchals, specially, designed, naturally, cooled, refrigerators, a, large, underground, space, with, thick, insulated, walls, was, connected, to, a, qanat, and, a, system, of, windcatchers, or, wind, towers, was, used, to, draw, cool, subterranean, air, up, from, the, qanat, to, maintain, temperatures, inside, the, space, at, low, levels, even, during, hot, summer, days, as, a, result, the, ice, melted, slowly, and, was, available, year, round, qanats, designated, foggaras, in, algeria, are, the, source, of, water, for, irrigation, in, large, oases, like, gourara, the, foggaras, are, also, found, at, touat, an, area, of, adrar, 200, km, from, gourara, the, length, of, the, foggaras, in, this, region, is, estimated, to, be, thousands, of, kilometers, although, sources, suggest, that, the, foggaras, may, have, been, in, use, as, early, as, 200, ce, they, were, clearly, in, use, by, the, 11th, century, after, the, arabs, took, possession, of, the, oases, in, the, 10th, century, and, the, residents, embraced, islam, the, water, is, metered, to, the, various, users, through, the, use, of, distribution, weirs, that, meter, flow, to, the, various, canals, each, for, a, separate, user, the, humidity, of, the, oases, is, also, used, to, supplement, the, water, supply, to, the, foggara, the, temperature, gradient, in, the, vertical, shafts, causes, air, to, rise, by, natural, convection, causing, a, draft, to, enter, the, foggara, the, moist, air, of, the, agricultural, area, is, drawn, into, the, foggara, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, water, run, off, in, the, foggara, it, condenses, on, the, tunnel, walls, and, the, air, passes, out, of, the, vertical, shafts, this, condensed, moisture, is, available, for, reuse, qanat, irrigation, technology, was, introduced, to, egypt, by, the, achaemenid, king, darius, i, during, his, reign, of, 522, bce, 486, bce, which, is, supported, by, the, historian, albert, t, olmstead, there, are, four, main, oases, in, the, egyptian, desert, the, kharga, oasis, is, one, that, has, been, extensively, studied, there, is, evidence, that, as, early, as, the, second, half, of, the, 5th, century, bce, water, brought, in, qanats, was, being, used, the, qanats, were, excavated, through, water, bearing, sandstone, rock, which, seeps, into, the, channel, with, water, collected, in, a, basin, behind, a, small, dam, at, the, end, the, width, is, approximately, 60, cm, 24, in, but, the, height, ranges, from, 5, to, 9, meters, it, is, likely, that, the, qanat, was, deepened, to, enhance, seepage, when, the, water, table, dropped, as, is, also, seen, in, iran, from, there, the, water, was, used, to, irrigate, fields, there, is, another, instructive, structure, located, at, the, kharga, oasis, a, well, that, apparently, dried, up, was, improved, by, driving, a, side, shaft, through, the, easily, penetrated, sandstone, presumably, in, the, direction, of, greatest, water, seepage, into, the, hill, of, ayn, man, w, r, also, written, ayn, manawir, to, allow, collection, of, additional, water, after, this, side, shaft, had, been, extended, another, vertical, shaft, was, driven, to, intersect, the, side, shaft, side, chambers, were, built, and, holes, bored, into, the, rock, presumably, at, points, where, water, seeped, from, the, rocks, are, evident, david, mattingly, reports, foggara, extending, for, hundreds, of, miles, in, the, garamantes, area, near, germa, in, libya, the, channels, were, generally, very, narrow, less, than, 2, feet, wide, and, 5, high, but, some, were, several, miles, long, and, in, total, some, 600, foggara, extended, for, hundreds, of, miles, underground, the, channels, were, dug, out, and, maintained, using, a, series, of, regularly, spaced, vertical, shafts, one, every, 30, feet, or, so, 100, 000, in, total, averaging, 30, feet, in, depth, but, sometimes, reaching, 130, in, southern, morocco, the, qanat, locally, khettara, is, also, used, on, the, margins, of, the, sahara, desert, the, isolated, oases, of, the, draa, river, valley, and, tafilalt, have, relied, on, qanat, water, for, irrigation, since, the, late, 14th, century, in, marrakech, and, the, haouz, plain, the, qanats, have, been, abandoned, since, the, early, 1970s, having, dried, up, in, the, tafilaft, area, half, of, the, 400, khettaras, are, still, in, use, the, 1971, hassan, adahkil, dam, s, build, in, the, main, course, of, the, ziz, river, and, its, subsequent, impact, on, local, water, tables, is, said, to, be, one, of, the, many, reasons, for, the, loss, of, half, of, the, khettara, the, black, berbers, haratin, of, the, south, were, the, hereditary, class, of, qanat, diggers, in, morocco, who, build, and, repair, these, systems, their, work, was, hazardous, the, foggara, water, management, system, in, tunisia, used, to, create, oases, is, similar, to, that, of, the, iranian, qanat, the, foggara, is, dug, into, the, foothills, of, a, fairly, steep, mountain, range, such, as, the, eastern, ranges, of, the, atlas, mountains, rainfall, in, the, mountains, enters, the, aquifer, and, moves, toward, the, saharan, region, to, the, south, the, foggara, 1, to, 3, km, 0, 62, to, 1, 9, mi, in, length, penetrates, the, aquifer, and, collects, water, families, maintain, the, foggara, and, own, the, land, it, irrigates, over, a, ten, meter, width, with, length, reckoned, by, the, size, of, plot, that, the, available, water, will, irrigate, the, qanats, are, called, kariz, in, dari, persian, and, pashto, and, have, been, in, use, since, the, pre, islamic, period, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, 9, 370, karizes, were, in, use, in, the, 20th, century, the, oldest, functional, kariz, which, is, more, than, 300, years, old, and, 8, kilometers, long, is, located, in, wardak, province, and, is, still, providing, water, to, nearly, 3, 000, people, many, of, these, ancient, structures, were, destroyed, during, the, soviet, aghan, war, and, the, war, in, afghanistan, maintenance, has, not, always, been, possible, the, cost, of, labour, has, become, very, high, and, maintaining, the, kariz, structures, is, no, longer, possible, lack, of, skilled, artisans, who, have, the, traditional, knowledge, also, poses, difficulties, a, number, of, the, large, farmers, are, abandoning, their, kariz, which, has, been, in, their, families, sometimes, for, centuries, and, moving, to, tube, and, dug, wells, backed, by, diesel, pumps, however, the, government, of, afghanistan, was, aware, of, the, importance, of, these, structures, and, all, efforts, were, made, to, repair, reconstruct, and, maintain, through, the, community, the, kariz, the, ministry, of, rural, rehabilitation, and, development, along, with, national, and, international, ngos, made, the, effort, there, were, still, functional, qanat, systems, in, 2009, american, forces, were, reported, to, have, unintentionally, destroyed, some, of, the, channels, during, expansion, of, a, military, base, creating, tensions, between, them, and, the, local, community, some, of, these, tunnels, were, used, to, store, supplies, and, to, move, men, and, equipment, underground, qanats, have, been, preserved, in, armenia, in, the, community, of, shvanidzor, in, the, southern, province, of, syunik, bordering, with, iran, qanats, are, named, kahrezes, in, armenian, there, are, 5, kahrezes, in, shvanidzor, four, of, them, were, constructed, before, the, village, was, founded, the, fifth, kahrez, was, constructed, in, 2005, potable, water, runs, through, three, of, them, and, two, are, in, poor, condition, in, the, summer, especially, in, july, and, august, the, amount, of, water, reaches, its, minimum, creating, a, critical, situation, in, the, water, supply, system, still, kahrezes, are, the, main, source, of, potable, and, irrigation, water, for, the, community, the, territory, of, azerbaijan, was, home, to, numerous, kahrizes, many, centuries, ago, archaeological, findings, suggest, that, long, before, the, 9th, century, ce, kahrizes, by, which, the, inhabitants, brought, potable, and, irrigation, water, to, their, settlements, were, in, use, in, azerbaijan, traditionally, kahrizes, were, built, and, maintained, by, a, group, of, masons, called, kankans, with, manual, labour, the, profession, was, handed, down, from, father, to, son, it, is, estimated, that, until, the, 20th, century, nearly, 1, 500, kahrizes, of, which, as, many, as, 400, were, in, the, nakhichevan, autonomous, republic, existed, in, azerbaijan, however, following, the, introduction, of, electric, and, fuel, pumped, wells, during, soviet, times, kahrizes, were, neglected, today, it, is, estimated, that, 800, are, still, functioning, in, azerbaijan, these, operational, kahrizes, are, key, to, the, life, of, many, communities, in, 1999, upon, the, request, of, the, communities, in, nakhichevan, the, international, organization, for, migration, iom, began, implementing, a, pilot, programme, to, rehabilitate, the, kahrizes, by, 2018, iom, rehabilitated, more, than, 163, kahrizes, with, funds, from, the, united, nations, development, programme, european, commission, canadian, international, development, agency, swiss, agency, for, development, and, cooperation, and, the, bureau, of, population, refugees, and, migration, us, state, department, and, the, self, contribution, of, the, local, communities, in, 2010, iom, began, a, kahriz, rehabilitation, project, with, funds, from, the, korea, international, cooperation, agency, during, the, first, phase, of, the, action, which, lasted, until, january, 2013, a, total, of, 20, kahrizes, in, the, mainland, of, azerbaijan, have, been, renovated, the, oasis, of, turpan, in, the, deserts, of, xinjiang, in, northwestern, china, uses, water, provided, by, qanat, locally, called, karez, there, are, nearly, 1, 000, karez, systems, in, the, area, and, the, total, length, of, the, canals, is, about, 5, 000, kilometers, turpan, has, long, been, the, center, of, a, fertile, oasis, and, an, important, trade, center, along, the, northern, silk, road, at, which, time, it, was, adjacent, to, the, kingdoms, of, korla, and, karashahr, to, the, southwest, the, historical, record, of, the, karez, extends, back, to, the, han, dynasty, the, turfan, water, museum, is, a, protected, area, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, because, of, the, importance, of, the, turpan, karez, water, system, to, the, history, of, the, area, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, an, estimated, 50, 000, qanats, were, in, use, in, iran, each, commissioned, and, maintained, by, local, users, of, these, only, 37, 000, remain, in, use, as, of, 2015, one, of, the, oldest, and, largest, known, qanats, is, in, the, iranian, city, of, gonabad, and, after, 2, 700, years, still, provides, drinking, and, agricultural, water, to, nearly, 40, 000, people, its, main, well, depth, is, more, than, 360, meters, and, its, length, is, 45, kilometers, yazd, khorasan, and, kerman, are, zones, known, for, their, dependence, on, an, extensive, system, of, qanats, in, 2016, unesco, inscribed, the, persian, qanat, as, a, world, heritage, site, listing, the, following, eleven, qanats, qasebeh, qanat, qanat, of, baladeh, qanat, of,

international, hydrological, programme, intergovernmental, council, began, investigating, the, possibility, of, an, international, qanat, research, center, to, be, located, in, yazd, iran, the, qanats, of, gonabad, also, called, kariz, kai, khosrow, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, largest, qanats, in, the, world, built, between, 700, bce, to, 500, bce, it, is, located, at, gonabad, razavi, khorasan, province, this, property, contains, 427, water, wells, with, total, length, of, 33, 113, m, 20, 575, mi, according, to, callisthenes, the, persians, were, using, water, clocks, in, 328, bce, to, ensure, a, just, and, exact, distribution, of, water, from, qanats, to, their, shareholders, for, agricultural, irrigation, the, use, of, water, clocks, in, iran, especially, in, qanats, of, gonabad, and, kariz, zibad, dates, back, to, 500, bce, later, they, were, also, used, to, determine, the, exact, holy, days, of, pre, islamic, religions, such, as, the, nowruz, chelah, or, yald, the, shortest, longest, and, equal, length, days, and, nights, of, the, years, the, water, clock, or, fenjaan, was, the, most, accurate, and, commonly, used, timekeeping, device, for, calculating, the, amount, or, the, time, that, a, farmer, must, take, water, from, the, qanats, of, gonabad, until, it, was, replaced, by, more, accurate, current, clocks, many, of, the, iranian, qanats, bear, some, characteristics, which, allow, us, to, call, them, feat, of, engineering, considering, the, intricate, techniques, used, in, their, construction, the, eastern, and, central, regions, of, iran, hold, the, most, qanats, due, to, low, precipitation, and, lack, of, permanent, surface, streams, whereas, a, small, number, of, qanats, can, be, found, in, the, northern, and, western, parts, which, receive, more, rainfall, and, enjoy, some, permanent, rivers, respectively, the, provinces, khorasan, razavi, southern, khorasan, isfahan, and, yazd, accommodate, the, most, qanats, but, from, the, viewpoint, of, water, discharge, the, provinces, isfahan, khorasan, razavi, fars, and, kerman, are, ranked, first, to, fourth, henri, golbot, explored, the, genesis, of, the, qanat, in, his, 1979, publication, les, qanats, une, technique, d, acquisition, de, l, eau, the, qanats, a, technique, for, obtaining, water, he, argues, that, the, ancient, iranians, made, use, of, the, water, that, the, miners, wished, to, get, rid, of, it, and, founded, a, basic, system, named, qanat, or, kariz, to, supply, the, required, water, to, their, farm, lands, according, to, golbot, this, innovation, took, place, in, the, northwest, of, the, present, iran, somewhere, bordering, turkey, and, later, was, introduced, to, the, neighboring, zagros, mountains, according, to, an, inscription, left, by, sargon, ii, the, king, of, assyria, in, 714, bce, he, invaded, the, city, of, uhlu, lying, in, the, northwest, of, uroomiye, lake, that, lay, in, the, territory, of, urartu, empire, and, then, he, noticed, that, the, occupied, area, enjoyed, a, very, rich, vegetation, even, though, there, was, no, river, running, across, it, so, he, managed, to, discover, the, reason, why, the, area, could, stay, green, and, realized, that, there, were, some, qanats, behind, the, matter, in, fact, it, was, ursa, the, king, of, the, region, who, had, rescued, the, people, from, thirst, and, turned, uhlu, into, a, prosperous, and, green, land, golbot, believes, that, the, influence, of, the, medeans, and, achaemenids, made, the, technology, of, qanat, spread, from, urartu, in, the, western, north, of, iran, and, near, the, present, border, between, iran, and, turkey, to, all, over, the, iranian, plateau, it, was, an, achaemenid, ruling, that, in, case, someone, succeeded, in, constructing, a, qanat, and, bringing, groundwater, to, the, surface, in, order, to, cultivate, land, or, in, renovating, an, abandoned, qanat, the, tax, he, was, supposed, to, pay, the, government, would, be, waived, not, only, for, him, but, also, for, his, successors, for, up, to, 5, generations, during, this, period, the, technology, of, qanat, was, in, its, heyday, and, it, even, spread, to, other, countries, for, example, following, darius, s, order, silaks, the, naval, commander, of, the, persian, army, and, khenombiz, the, royal, architect, managed, to, construct, a, qanat, in, the, oasis, of, kharagha, in, egypt, beadnell, believes, that, qanat, construction, dates, back, to, two, distinct, periods, they, were, first, constructed, by, the, persians, and, later, the, romans, dug, some, other, qanats, during, their, reign, in, egypt, from, 30, bce, to, 395, ce, the, magnificent, temple, built, in, this, area, during, darius, s, reign, shows, that, there, was, a, considerable, population, depending, on, the, water, of, qanats, ragerz, has, estimated, this, population, to, be, 10, 000, people, the, most, reliable, document, confirming, the, existence, of, qanats, at, this, time, was, written, by, polybius, who, states, that, the, streams, are, running, down, from, everywhere, at, the, base, of, alborz, mountain, and, people, have, transferred, too, much, water, from, a, long, distance, through, some, subterranean, canals, by, spending, much, cost, and, labor, during, the, seleucid, era, which, began, after, the, occupation, of, iran, by, alexander, the, great, it, seems, that, the, qanats, were, abandoned, in, terms, of, the, situation, of, qanats, during, this, era, some, historical, records, have, been, found, in, a, study, by, russian, orientalist, scholars, it, has, been, mentioned, that, the, persians, used, the, side, branches, of, rivers, mountain, springs, wells, and, qanats, to, supply, water, the, subterranean, galleries, excavated, to, obtain, groundwater, were, named, as, qanat, these, galleries, were, linked, to, the, surface, through, some, vertical, shafts, which, were, sunk, in, order, to, get, access, to, the, gallery, to, repair, it, if, necessary, according, to, the, historical, records, the, parthian, kings, did, not, care, about, the, qanats, the, way, the, achaemenid, kings, and, even, sassanid, kings, did, as, an, instance, arsac, iii, one, of, the, parthian, kings, destroyed, some, qanats, in, order, to, make, it, difficult, for, seleucid, antiochus, to, advance, further, while, fighting, him, the, historical, records, from, this, time, indicate, a, perfect, regulation, on, both, water, distribution, and, farmlands, all, the, water, rights, were, recorded, in, a, special, document, which, was, referred, to, in, case, of, any, transaction, the, lists, of, farmlands, whether, private, or, governmental, were, kept, at, the, tax, department, during, this, period, there, were, some, official, rulings, on, qanats, streams, construction, of, dam, operation, and, maintenance, of, qanats, etc, the, government, proceeded, to, repair, or, dredge, the, qanats, that, were, abandoned, or, destroyed, and, to, construct, the, new, qanats, if, necessary, a, document, written, in, the, pahlavi, language, points, out, the, important, role, of, qanats, in, developing, the, cities, at, that, time, in, iran, the, advent, of, islam, which, coincided, with, the, overthrow, of, the, sassanid, dynasty, brought, about, a, profound, change, in, religious, political, social, and, cultural, structures, but, the, qanats, stayed, intact, because, the, economic, infrastructure, including, qanats, was, of, great, importance, to, the, arabs, as, an, instance, m, lombard, reports, that, the, moslem, clerics, who, lived, during, abbasid, period, such, as, abooyoosef, ya, qoob, died, 798, ce, stipulated, that, whoever, can, bring, water, to, the, idle, lands, in, order, to, cultivate, his, tax, would, be, waived, and, he, would, be, entitled, to, the, lands, cultivated, therefore, this, policy, did, not, differ, from, that, of, the, achaemenids, in, not, getting, any, tax, from, the, people, who, revived, abandoned, lands, the, arabs, supportive, policy, on, qanats, was, so, successful, that, even, mecca, gained, a, qanat, the, persian, historian, hamdollah, mostowfi, writes, zobeyde, khatoon, haroon, al, rashid, s, wife, constructed, a, qanat, in, mecca, after, the, time, of, haroon, al, rashid, during, the, caliph, moghtader, s, reign, this, qanat, fell, into, decay, but, he, rehabilitated, it, and, the, qanat, was, rehabilitated, again, after, it, collapsed, during, the, reign, of, two, other, caliphs, named, ghaem, and, naser, after, the, era, of, the, caliphs, this, qanat, completely, fell, into, ruin, because, the, desert, sand, filled, it, up, but, later, amir, choopan, repaired, the, qanat, and, made, it, flow, again, in, mecca, there, are, also, other, historical, texts, proving, that, the, abbasids, were, concerned, about, qanats, for, example, according, to, the, incidents, of, abdollah, bin, tahir, s, time, written, by, gardizi, in, 830, ce, a, terrible, earthquake, struck, the, town, of, forghaneh, and, reduced, many, homes, to, rubble, the, inhabitants, of, neyshaboor, used, to, come, to, abdollah, bin, tahir, in, order, to, request, him, to, intervene, for, they, fought, over, their, qanats, and, found, the, relevant, instruction, or, law, on, qanat, as, a, solution, neither, in, the, prophet, s, quotations, nor, in, the, clerics, writings, so, abdollah, bin, tahir, managed, to, bring, together, all, the, clergymen, from, throughout, khorasan, and, iraq, to, compile, a, book, entitled, alghani, the, book, of, qanat, this, book, collected, all, the, rulings, on, qanats, which, could, be, of, use, to, whoever, wanted, to, judge, a, dispute, over, this, issue, gardizi, added, that, this, book, was, still, applicable, to, his, time, and, everyone, made, references, to, this, book, one, can, deduce, from, these, facts, that, during, the, above, mentioned, period, the, number, of, qanats, was, so, considerable, that, the, authorities, were, prompted, to, put, together, some, legal, instructions, concerning, them, also, it, shows, that, from, the, 9th, to, 11th, centuries, the, qanats, that, were, the, hub, of, the, agricultural, systems, were, also, of, interest, to, the, government, apart, from, the, book, of, alghani, which, is, considered, as, a, law, booklet, focusing, on, qanat, related, rulings, based, on, islamic, principles, there, is, another, book, about, groundwater, written, by, karaji, in, 1010, this, book, entitled, extraction, of, hidden, waters, examines, just, the, technical, issues, associated, with, the, qanat, and, tries, to, answer, the, common, questions, such, as, how, to, construct, and, repair, a, qanat, how, to, find, a, groundwater, supply, how, to, do, leveling, etc, some, of, the, innovations, described, in, this, book, were, introduced, for, the, first, time, in, the, history, of, hydrogeology, and, some, of, its, technical, methods, are, still, valid, and, can, be, applied, in, qanat, construction, the, content, of, the, book, implies, that, its, writer, karaji, did, not, have, any, idea, that, there, was, another, book, on, qanats, compiled, by, the, clergymen, there, are, some, records, dating, back, to, that, time, signifying, their, concern, about, the, legal, vicinity, of, qanats, for, example, mohammad, bin, hasan, quotes, aboo, hanifeh, that, in, case, someone, constructs, a, qanat, in, abandoned, land, someone, else, can, dig, another, qanat, in, the, same, land, on, the, condition, that, the, second, qanat, is, 500, zera, 375, meters, away, from, the, first, one, ms, lambton, quotes, moeen, al, din, esfarzi, who, wrote, the, book, rowzat, al, jannat, the, garden, of, paradise, that, abdollah, bin, tahir, from, the, taherian, dynasty, and, ismaeel, ahmed, samani, from, the, samani, dynasty, had, several, qanats, constructed, in, neyshaboor, later, in, the, 11th, century, a, writer, named, nasir, khosrow, acknowledged, all, those, qanats, with, the, following, words, neyshaboor, is, located, in, a, vast, plain, at, a, distance, of, 40, farsang, 240, km, from, serakhs, and, 70, farsang, 420, km, from, mary, marv, all, the, qanats, of, this, city, run, underground, and, it, is, said, that, an, arab, who, was, offended, by, the, people, of, neyshaboor, has, complained, that, what, a, beautiful, city, neyshaboor, could, have, become, if, its, qanats, would, have, flowed, on, the, ground, surface, and, instead, its, people, would, have, been, underground, these, documents, all, certify, the, importance, of, qanats, during, the, islamic, history, within, the, cultural, territories, of, iran, in, the, 13th, century, the, invasion, of, iran, by, mongolian, tribes, reduced, many, qanats, and, irrigation, systems, to, ruin, and, many, qanats, were, deserted, and, dried, up, later, in, the, era, of, the, ilkhanid, dynasty, especially, at, the, time, of, ghazan, khan, and, his, persian, minister, rashid, al, din, fazl, allah, some, measures, were, taken, to, revive, the, qanats, and, irrigation, systems, there, is, a, 14th, century, book, entitled, al, vaghfiya, al, rashidiya, rashid, s, deeds, of, endowment, that, names, all, the, properties, located, in, yazd, shiraz, maraghe, tabriz, isfahan, and, mowsel, that, rashid, fazl, allah, donated, to, the, public, or, religious, places, this, book, mentions, many, qanats, running, at, that, time, and, irrigating, a, considerable, area, of, farmland, at, the, same, time, another, book, entitled, jame, al, kheyrat, was, written, by, seyyed, rokn, al, din, on, the, same, subject, as, rashid, s, book, in, this, book, seyyed, rokn, al, din, names, the, properties, he, donated, in, the, region, of, yazd, these, deeds, of, endowment, indicate, that, much, attention, was, given, to, the, qanats, during, the, reign, of, ilkhanids, but, it, is, attributable, to, their, persian, ministers, who, influenced, them, in, 1984, 1985, the, ministry, of, energy, took, a, census, of, 28, 038, qanats, whose, total, discharge, was, 9, billion, cubic, meters, in, the, years, 1992, 1993, the, census, of, 28, 054, qanats, showed, a, total, discharge, of, 10, billion, cubic, meters, 10, years, later, in, 2002, 2003, the, number, of, the, qanats, was, reported, as, 33, 691, with, a, total, discharge, of, 8, billion, cubic, meters, in, the, restricted, regions, there, are, 317, 225, wells, qanats, and, springs, that, discharge, 36, 719, million, cubic, meters, water, per, year, out, of, which, 3, 409, million, cubic, meters, is, surplus, to, the, aquifer, capacity, in, 2005, in, the, country, as, a, whole, there, were, 130, 008, deep, wells, with, a, discharge, of, 31, 403, million, cubic, meters, 33, 8041, semi, deep, wells, with, a, discharge, of, 13, 491, million, cubic, meters, 34, 355, qanats, with, a, discharge, of, 8, 212, million, cubic, meters, and, 55, 912, natural, springs, with, a, discharge, of, 21, 240, million, cubic, meters, in, 2021, a, british, trained, architect, margot, krasojevi, designed, a, luxury, eco, hotel, based, on, principles, of, qanat, and, windcatchers, in, a, desert, in, iran, called, qanat, the, project, has, not, yet, been, built, but, offers, ideas, for, applying, ancient, technology, to, modern, day, cooling, problems, in, the, desert, a, survey, of, qanat, systems, in, the, kurdistan, region, of, iraq, conducted, by, the, department, of, geography, at, oklahoma, state, university, us, on, behalf, of, unesco, in, 2009, found, that, out, of, 683, karez, systems, some, 380, were, still, active, in, 2004, but, only, 116, were, active, by, 2009, reasons, for, the, decline, of, qanats, include, abandonment, and, neglect, prior, to, 2004, excessive, pumping, from, wells, and, since, 2005, drought, water, shortages, are, said, to, have, forced, since, 2005, over, 100, 000, people, who, depended, for, their, livelihoods, on, karez, systems, to, leave, their, homes, the, study, says, that, a, single, karez, has, the, potential, to, provide, enough, household, water, for, nearly, 9, 000, individuals, and, irrigate, over, 200, hectares, of, farmland, unesco, and, the, government, of, iraq, plan, to, rehabilitate, the, karez, through, a, karez, initiative, for, community, revitalization, launched, in, 2010, most, of, the, karez, are, in, sulaymaniyah, governorate, 84, a, large, number, are, also, found, in, erbil, governorate, 13, especially, on, the, broad, plain, around, and, in, erbil, city, in, india, there, are, karez, systems, are, located, at, bidar, bijapur, burhanpur, kundi, bhandara, and, aurgangabad, the, bidar, karez, systems, were, probably, the, first, dug, in, india, it, dates, to, the, bahmani, period, bidar, has, three, karez, systems, as, per, ghulam, yazdani, s, documentation, other, than, naubad, there, are, two, more, karez, systems, in, bidar, shukla, theerth, and, jamna, mori, the, shukla, theerth, is, the, longest, karez, system, in, bidar, the, mother, well, of, this, karez, has, been, discovered, by, near, gornalli, kere, a, historic, embankment, the, third, system, called, jamna, mori, is, more, of, a, distribution, system, within, the, old, city, area, with, many, channels, crisscrossing, the, city, lanes, restoration, efforts, commenced, in, 2014, with, the, desilting, and, excavation, of, the, naubad, karez, in, 2015, uncovering, 27, vertical, shafts, linked, to, the, karez, the, rejuvenation, of, the, system, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, water, deficit, city, of, bidar, a, seventh, line, of, the, system, was, discovered, in, 2016, during, a, sewage, line, excavation, valliyil, govindankutty, assistant, professor, in, geography, at, government, college, chittur, was, responsible, for, rediscovery, and, mapping, of, the, naubad, karez, system, in, 2012, 2013, later, in, 2014, 2016, team, yuvaa, joined, govindankutty, to, help, uncover, other, two, karez, systems, in, bidar, detailed, documentation, of, the, naubad, karez, system, was, done, in, august, 2013, and, a, report, was, submitted, to, district, administration, of, bidar, that, found, several, new, facts, the, research, has, led, to, the, initiation, of, cleaning, the, debris, and, collapsed, sections, paving, the, way, to, its, rejuvenation, the, cleaning, of, karez, has, led, to, bringing, water, to, higher, areas, of, the, plateau, and, it, has, in, turn, recharged, the, wells, in, the, vicinity, the, bijapur, karez, system, is, much, more, complicated, a, reveals, that, it, has, surface, water, and, groundwater, connections, the, bijapur, karez, is, a, network, of, shallow, masonry, aqueducts, terracotta, ceramic, pipes, embankments, and, reservoirs, tanks, etc, all, weave, together, a, network, to, ensure, water, reaches, the, old, city, the, system, starts, at, torwi, and, extends, as, shallow, aqueducts, and, further, as, pipes, further, it, becomes, deeper, from, the, sainik, school, area, onward, which, exists, as, a, tunnel, dug, through, the, geology, the, system, can, be, clearly, traced, up, to, ibrahim, roja, in, aurangabad, the, karez, systems, are, called, nahars, these, are, shallow, aqueducts, running, through, the, city, there, are, 14, aqueducts, in, aurangabad, the, nahar, i, ambari, is, the, oldest, and, longest, its, again, a, combination, of, shallow, aqueducts, open, channels, pipes, cisterns, etc, the, source, of, water, is, a, surface, water, body, the, karez, has, been, constructed, right, below, the, bed, of, lake, the, lake, water, seeps, through, the, soil, into, the, karez, gallery, in, burhanpur, the, karez, is, called, kundi, bhandara, sometimes, wrongly, referred, to, as, khuni, bhandara, the, system, is, approx, 6, km, long, starts, from, the, alluvial, fans, of, satpura, hills, in, the, north, of, the, town, unlike, bidar, bijapur, and, aurgangabad, the, system, airvents, are, round, in, shape, inside, the, karez, one, could, see, lime, depositions, on, the, walls, the, systems, ends, to, carry, water, further, to, palaces, and, public, fountains, through, pipe, line, it, has, been, suggested, that, underground, temples, at, gua, made, in, java, reached, by, shafts, in, which, masks, of, a, green, metal, were, found, originated, as, a, qanat, in, japan, there, are, several, dozen, qanat, like, structures, locally, known, as, mambo, or, manbo, most, notably, in, the, mie, and, gifu, prefectures, whereas, some, link, their, origin, clearly, to, the, chinese, karez, and, therefore, to, the, iranian, source, a, japanese, conference, in, 2008, found, insufficient, scientific, studies, to, evaluate, the, origins, of, the, mambo, among, the, qanats, built, in, the, roman, empire, the, 94, km, 58, mi, long, gadara, aqueduct, in, northern, jordan, was, possibly, the, longest, continuous, qanat, ever, built, partly, following, the, course, of, an, older, hellenistic, aqueduct, excavation, work, arguably, started, after, a, visit, by, emperor, hadrian, in, 129, 130, ce, the, gadara, aqueduct, was, never, totally, finished, and, was, put, in, service, only, in, sections, in, pakistan, qanat, irrigation, system, is, endemic, only, in, balochistan, the, major, concentration, is, in, the, north, and, northwest, along, the, pakistan, afghanistan, border, and, oasis, of, makoran, division, the, karez, system, of, the, balochistan, desert, is, on, the, tentative, list, for, future, world, heritage, sites, in, pakistan, the, acute, shortage, of, water, resources, give, water, a, decisive, role, in, the, regional, conflicts, arose, in, the, course, of, history, of, balochistan, therefore, in, balochistan, the, possession, of, water, resources, is, more, important, than, ownership, of, land, hence, afterward, a, complex, system, for, the, collection, channeling, and, distribution, of, water, was, developed, in, balochistan, similarly, the, distribution, and, unbiased, flow, of, water, to, different, stockholders, also, necessitate, the, importance, of, different, societal, classes, in, balochistan, in, general, and, particularly, in, makoran, for, instance, sarrishta, literally, head, of, the, chain, is, responsible, for, administration, of, channel, he, normally, owns, the, largest, water, quota, under, sarrishta, there, are, several, heads, of, owners, issadar, who, also, possessed, larger, water, quotas, the, social, hierarchy, within, baloch, society, of, makoran, depends, upon, the, possession, of, largest, quotas, of, water, the, role, of, sarrishta, in, some, cases, hierarchical, and, passing, from, generations, within, the, family, and, he, must, have, the, knowledge, of, the, criteria, of, unbiased, distribution, of, water, among, different, issadar, the, sharing, of, water, is, based, on, a, complex, indigenous, system, of, measurement, depends, upon, time, and, space, particularly, to, the, phases, of, moon, the, hangams, based, on, seasonal, variations, and, share, of, water, the, hangams, are, apportioned, among, various, owners, over, period, of, seven, or, fourteen, days, however, in, some, places, instead, of, hangam, anna, used, which, is, based, on, twelve, hour, period, for, each, quota, therefore, if, a, person, own, 16, quotas, it, means, that, he, is, entitled, for, water, for, eight, days, in, high, seasons, and, 16, days, in, winter, when, water, level, went, down, as, well, as, expectation, of, winter, rain, baharga, in, makran, region, the, twelve, hour, water, quota, again, subdivided, into, several, sub, fractions, of, local, measuring, scales, such, as, tas, or, pad, dr, gul, hasan, pro, vc, luawms, 2, day, national, conference, on, kech, the, chagai, district, is, in, the, north, west, corner, of, balochistan, pakistan, bordering, with, afghanistan, and, iran, qanats, locally, known, as, kahn, are, found, more, broadly, in, this, region, they, are, spread, from, chaghai, district, all, the, way, up, to, zhob, district, qanats, were, found, over, much, of, syria, the, widespread, installation, of, groundwater, pumps, has, lowered, the, water, table, and, qanat, system, qanats, have, gone, dry, and, been, abandoned, across, the, country, in, oman, from, the, iron, age, period, found, in, salut, bat, and, other, sites, a, system, of, underground, aqueducts, called, falaj, were, constructed, a, series, of, well, like, vertical, shafts, connected, by, gently, sloping, horizontal, tunnels, there, are, three, types, of, falaj, daudi, arabic, with, underground, aqueducts, ghaili, arabic, requiring, a, dam, to, collect, the, water, and, aini, arabic, whose, source, is, a, water, spring, these, enabled, large, scale, agriculture, to, flourish, in, a, dryland, environment, according, to, unesco, some, 3, 000, aflaj, plural, or, falaj, singular, are, still, in, use, in, oman, today, nizwa, the, former, capital, city, of, oman, was, built, around, a, falaj, which, is, in, use, to, this, day, these, systems, date, to, before, the, iron, age, in, oman, in, july, 2006, five, representative, examples, of, this, irrigation, system, were, inscribed, as, a, world, heritage,
