a, gas, turbine, gas, turbine, engine, or, also, known, by, its, old, name, internal, combustion, turbine, is, a, type, of, continuous, flow, internal, combustion, engine, the, main, parts, common, to, all, gas, turbine, engines, form, the, power, producing, part, known, as, the, gas, generator, or, core, and, are, in, the, direction, of, flow, additional, components, have, to, be, added, to, the, gas, generator, to, suit, its, application, common, to, all, is, an, air, inlet, but, with, different, configurations, to, suit, the, requirements, of, marine, use, land, use, or, flight, at, speeds, varying, from, stationary, to, supersonic, a, propelling, nozzle, is, added, to, produce, thrust, for, flight, an, extra, turbine, is, added, to, drive, a, propeller, turboprop, or, ducted, fan, turbofan, to, reduce, fuel, consumption, by, increasing, propulsive, efficiency, at, subsonic, flight, speeds, an, extra, turbine, is, also, required, to, drive, a, helicopter, rotor, or, land, vehicle, transmission, turboshaft, marine, propeller, or, electrical, generator, power, turbine, greater, thrust, to, weight, ratio, for, flight, is, achieved, with, the, addition, of, an, afterburner, the, basic, operation, of, the, gas, turbine, is, a, brayton, cycle, with, air, as, the, working, fluid, atmospheric, air, flows, through, the, compressor, that, brings, it, to, higher, pressure, energy, is, then, added, by, spraying, fuel, into, the, air, and, igniting, it, so, that, the, combustion, generates, a, high, temperature, flow, this, high, temperature, pressurized, gas, enters, a, turbine, producing, a, shaft, work, output, in, the, process, used, to, drive, the, compressor, the, unused, energy, comes, out, in, the, exhaust, gases, that, can, be, repurposed, for, external, work, such, as, directly, producing, thrust, in, a, turbojet, engine, or, rotating, a, second, independent, turbine, known, as, a, power, turbine, that, can, be, connected, to, a, fan, propeller, or, electrical, generator, the, purpose, of, the, gas, turbine, determines, the, design, so, that, the, most, desirable, split, of, energy, between, the, thrust, and, the, shaft, work, is, achieved, the, fourth, step, of, the, brayton, cycle, cooling, of, the, working, fluid, is, omitted, as, gas, turbines, are, open, systems, that, do, not, reuse, the, same, air, gas, turbines, are, used, to, power, aircraft, trains, ships, electrical, generators, pumps, gas, compressors, and, tanks, in, an, ideal, gas, turbine, gases, undergo, four, thermodynamic, processes, an, isentropic, compression, an, isobaric, constant, pressure, combustion, an, isentropic, expansion, and, isobaric, heat, rejection, together, these, make, up, the, brayton, cycle, also, known, as, the, constant, pressure, cycle, it, is, distinguished, from, the, otto, cycle, in, that, all, the, processes, compression, ignition, combustion, exhaust, occur, at, the, same, time, continuously, in, a, real, gas, turbine, mechanical, energy, is, changed, irreversibly, due, to, internal, friction, and, turbulence, into, pressure, and, thermal, energy, when, the, gas, is, compressed, in, either, a, centrifugal, or, axial, compressor, heat, is, added, in, the, combustion, chamber, and, the, specific, volume, of, the, gas, increases, accompanied, by, a, slight, loss, in, pressure, during, expansion, through, the, stator, and, rotor, passages, in, the, turbine, irreversible, energy, transformation, once, again, occurs, fresh, air, is, taken, in, in, place, of, the, heat, rejection, air, is, taken, in, by, a, compressor, called, a, gas, generator, with, either, an, axial, or, centrifugal, design, or, a, combination, of, the, two, this, air, is, then, ducted, into, the, combustor, section, which, can, be, of, a, annular, can, or, can, annular, design, in, the, combustor, section, roughly, 70, of, the, air, from, the, compressor, is, ducted, around, the, combustor, itself, for, cooling, purposes, the, remaining, roughly, 30, the, air, is, mixed, with, fuel, and, ignited, by, the, already, burning, air, fuel, mixture, which, then, expands, producing, power, across, the, turbine, this, expansion, of, the, mixture, then, leaves, the, combustor, section, and, has, its, velocity, increased, across, the, turbine, section, to, strike, the, turbine, blades, spinning, the, disc, they, are, attached, to, thus, creating, useful, power, of, the, power, produced, 60, 70, is, solely, used, to, power, the, gas, generator, the, remaining, power, is, used, to, power, what, the, engine, is, being, used, for, typically, an, aviation, application, being, thrust, in, a, turbojet, driving, the, fan, of, a, turbofan, rotor, or, accessory, of, a, turboshaft, and, gear, reduction, and, propeller, of, a, turboprop, if, the, engine, has, a, power, turbine, added, to, drive, an, industrial, generator, or, a, helicopter, rotor, the, exit, pressure, will, be, as, close, to, the, entry, pressure, as, possible, with, only, enough, energy, left, to, overcome, the, pressure, losses, in, the, exhaust, ducting, and, expel, the, exhaust, for, a, turboprop, engine, there, will, be, a, particular, balance, between, propeller, power, and, jet, thrust, which, gives, the, most, economical, operation, in, a, turbojet, engine, only, enough, pressure, and, energy, is, extracted, from, the, flow, to, drive, the, compressor, and, other, components, the, remaining, high, pressure, gases, are, accelerated, through, a, nozzle, to, provide, a, jet, to, propel, an, aircraft, the, smaller, the, engine, the, higher, the, rotation, rate, of, the, shaft, must, be, to, attain, the, required, blade, tip, speed, blade, tip, speed, determines, the, maximum, pressure, ratios, that, can, be, obtained, by, the, turbine, and, the, compressor, this, in, turn, limits, the, maximum, power, and, efficiency, that, can, be, obtained, by, the, engine, in, order, for, tip, speed, to, remain, constant, if, the, diameter, of, a, rotor, is, reduced, by, half, the, rotational, speed, must, double, for, example, large, jet, engines, operate, around, 10, 000, 25, 000, rpm, while, micro, turbines, spin, as, fast, as, 500, 000, rpm, mechanically, gas, turbines, can, be, considerably, less, complex, than, reciprocating, engines, simple, turbines, might, have, one, main, moving, part, the, compressor, shaft, turbine, rotor, assembly, with, other, moving, parts, in, the, fuel, system, this, in, turn, can, translate, into, price, for, instance, costing, 10, 000, for, materials, the, jumo, 004, proved, cheaper, than, the, junkers, 213, piston, engine, which, was, 35, 000, and, needed, only, 375, hours, of, lower, skill, labor, to, complete, including, manufacture, assembly, and, shipping, compared, to, 1, 400, for, the, bmw, 801, this, however, also, translated, into, poor, efficiency, and, reliability, more, advanced, gas, turbines, such, as, those, found, in, modern, jet, engines, or, combined, cycle, power, plants, may, have, 2, or, 3, shafts, spools, hundreds, of, compressor, and, turbine, blades, movable, stator, blades, and, extensive, external, tubing, for, fuel, oil, and, air, systems, they, use, temperature, resistant, alloys, and, are, made, with, tight, specifications, requiring, precision, manufacture, all, this, often, makes, the, construction, of, a, simple, gas, turbine, more, complicated, than, a, piston, engine, moreover, to, reach, optimum, performance, in, modern, gas, turbine, power, plants, the, gas, needs, to, be, prepared, to, exact, fuel, specifications, fuel, gas, conditioning, systems, treat, the, natural, gas, to, reach, the, exact, fuel, specification, prior, to, entering, the, turbine, in, terms, of, pressure, temperature, gas, composition, and, the, related, wobbe, index, the, primary, advantage, of, a, gas, turbine, engine, is, its, power, to, weight, ratio, since, significant, useful, work, can, be, generated, by, a, relatively, lightweight, engine, gas, turbines, are, perfectly, suited, for, aircraft, propulsion, thrust, bearings, and, journal, bearings, are, a, critical, part, of, a, design, they, are, hydrodynamic, oil, bearings, or, oil, cooled, rolling, element, bearings, foil, bearings, are, used, in, some, small, machines, such, as, micro, turbines, and, also, have, strong, potential, for, use, in, small, gas, turbines, auxiliary, power, units, a, major, challenge, facing, turbine, design, especially, turbine, blades, is, reducing, the, creep, that, is, induced, by, the, high, temperatures, and, stresses, that, are, experienced, during, operation, higher, operating, temperatures, are, continuously, sought, in, order, to, increase, efficiency, but, come, at, the, cost, of, higher, creep, rates, several, methods, have, therefore, been, employed, in, an, attempt, to, achieve, optimal, performance, while, limiting, creep, with, the, most, successful, ones, being, high, performance, coatings, and, single, crystal, superalloys, these, technologies, work, by, limiting, deformation, that, occurs, by, mechanisms, that, can, be, broadly, classified, as, dislocation, glide, dislocation, climb, and, diffusional, flow, protective, coatings, provide, thermal, insulation, of, the, blade, and, offer, oxidation, and, corrosion, resistance, thermal, barrier, coatings, tbcs, are, often, stabilized, zirconium, dioxide, based, ceramics, and, oxidation, corrosion, resistant, coatings, bond, coats, typically, consist, of, aluminides, or, mcraly, where, m, is, typically, fe, and, or, cr, alloys, using, tbcs, limits, the, temperature, exposure, of, the, superalloy, substrate, thereby, decreasing, the, diffusivity, of, the, active, species, typically, vacancies, within, the, alloy, and, reducing, dislocation, and, vacancy, creep, it, has, been, found, that, a, coating, of, 1, 200, m, can, decrease, blade, temperatures, by, up, to, 200, c, 392, f, bond, coats, are, directly, applied, onto, the, surface, of, the, substrate, using, pack, carburization, and, serve, the, dual, purpose, of, providing, improved, adherence, for, the, tbc, and, oxidation, resistance, for, the, substrate, the, al, from, the, bond, coats, forms, al, 2, o, 3, on, the, tbc, bond, coat, interface, which, provides, the, oxidation, resistance, but, also, results, in, the, formation, of, an, undesirable, interdiffusion, id, zone, between, itself, and, the, substrate, the, oxidation, resistance, outweighs, the, drawbacks, associated, with, the, id, zone, as, it, increases, the, lifetime, of, the, blade, and, limits, the, efficiency, losses, caused, by, a, buildup, on, the, outside, of, the, blades, nickel, based, superalloys, boast, improved, strength, and, creep, resistance, due, to, their, composition, and, resultant, microstructure, the, gamma, fcc, nickel, is, alloyed, with, aluminum, and, titanium, in, order, to, precipitate, a, uniform, dispersion, of, the, coherent, ni, 3, al, ti, gamma, prime, phases, the, finely, dispersed, precipitates, impede, dislocation, motion, and, introduce, a, threshold, stress, increasing, the, stress, required, for, the, onset, of, creep, furthermore, is, an, ordered, l1, 2, phase, that, makes, it, harder, for, dislocations, to, shear, past, it, further, refractory, elements, such, as, rhenium, and, ruthenium, can, be, added, in, solid, solution, to, improve, creep, strength, the, addition, of, these, elements, reduces, the, diffusion, of, the, gamma, prime, phase, thus, preserving, the, fatigue, resistance, strength, and, creep, resistance, the, development, of, single, crystal, superalloys, has, led, to, significant, improvements, in, creep, resistance, as, well, due, to, the, lack, of, grain, boundaries, single, crystals, eliminate, coble, creep, and, consequently, deform, by, fewer, modes, decreasing, the, creep, rate, although, single, crystals, have, lower, creep, at, high, temperatures, they, have, significantly, lower, yield, stresses, at, room, temperature, where, strength, is, determined, by, the, hall, petch, relationship, care, needs, to, be, taken, in, order, to, optimize, the, design, parameters, to, limit, high, temperature, creep, while, not, decreasing, low, temperature, yield, strength, airbreathing, jet, engines, are, gas, turbines, optimized, to, produce, thrust, from, the, exhaust, gases, or, from, ducted, fans, connected, to, the, gas, turbines, jet, engines, that, produce, thrust, from, the, direct, impulse, of, exhaust, gases, are, often, called, turbojets, while, still, in, service, with, many, militaries, and, civilian, operators, turbojets, have, mostly, been, phased, out, in, favor, of, the, turbofan, engine, due, to, the, turbojet, s, low, fuel, efficiency, and, high, noise, those, that, generate, thrust, with, the, addition, of, a, ducted, fan, are, called, turbofans, or, rarely, fan, jets, these, engines, produce, nearly, 80, of, their, thrust, by, the, ducted, fan, which, can, be, seen, from, the, front, of, the, engine, they, come, in, two, types, low, bypass, turbofan, and, high, bypass, the, difference, being, the, amount, of, air, moved, by, the, fan, called, bypass, air, these, engines, offer, the, benefit, of, more, thrust, without, extra, fuel, consumption, gas, turbines, are, also, used, in, many, liquid, fuel, rockets, where, gas, turbines, are, used, to, power, a, turbopump, to, permit, the, use, of, lightweight, low, pressure, tanks, reducing, the, empty, weight, of, the, rocket, a, turboprop, engine, is, a, turbine, engine, that, drives, an, aircraft, propeller, using, a, reduction, gear, to, translate, high, turbine, section, operating, speed, often, in, the, 10s, of, thousands, into, low, thousands, necessary, for, efficient, propeller, operation, the, benefit, of, using, the, turboprop, engine, is, to, take, advantage, of, the, turbine, engines, high, power, to, weight, ratio, to, drive, a, propeller, thus, allowing, a, more, powerful, but, also, smaller, engine, to, be, used, turboprop, engines, are, used, on, a, wide, range, of, business, aircraft, such, as, the, pilatus, pc, 12, commuter, aircraft, such, as, the, beechcraft, 1900, and, small, cargo, aircraft, such, as, the, cessna, 208, caravan, or, de, havilland, canada, dash, 8, and, large, aircraft, typically, military, such, as, the, airbus, a400m, transport, lockheed, ac, 130, and, the, 60, year, old, tupolev, tu, 95, strategic, bomber, while, military, turboprop, engines, can, vary, in, the, civilian, market, there, are, two, primary, engines, to, be, found, the, pratt, whitney, canada, pt6, a, free, turbine, turboshaft, engine, and, the, honeywell, tpe331, a, fixed, turbine, engine, formerly, designated, as, the, garrett, airesearch, 331, aeroderivative, gas, turbines, are, generally, based, on, existing, aircraft, gas, turbine, engines, and, are, smaller, and, lighter, than, industrial, gas, turbines, aeroderivatives, are, used, in, electrical, power, generation, due, to, their, ability, to, be, shut, down, and, handle, load, changes, more, quickly, than, industrial, machines, they, are, also, used, in, the, marine, industry, to, reduce, weight, common, types, include, the, general, electric, lm2500, general, electric, lm6000, and, aeroderivative, versions, of, the, pratt, whitney, pw4000, pratt, whitney, ft4, and, rolls, royce, rb211, increasing, numbers, of, gas, turbines, are, being, used, or, even, constructed, by, amateurs, in, its, most, straightforward, form, these, are, commercial, turbines, acquired, through, military, surplus, or, scrapyard, sales, then, operated, for, display, as, part, of, the, hobby, of, engine, collecting, in, its, most, extreme, form, amateurs, have, even, rebuilt, engines, beyond, professional, repair, and, then, used, them, to, compete, for, the, land, speed, record, the, simplest, form, of, self, constructed, gas, turbine, employs, an, automotive, turbocharger, as, the, core, component, a, combustion, chamber, is, fabricated, and, plumbed, between, the, compressor, and, turbine, sections, more, sophisticated, turbojets, are, also, built, where, their, thrust, and, light, weight, are, sufficient, to, power, large, model, aircraft, the, schreckling, design, constructs, the, entire, engine, from, raw, materials, including, the, fabrication, of, a, centrifugal, compressor, wheel, from, plywood, epoxy, and, wrapped, carbon, fibre, strands, several, small, companies, now, manufacture, small, turbines, and, parts, for, the, amateur, most, turbojet, powered, model, aircraft, are, now, using, these, commercial, and, semi, commercial, microturbines, rather, than, a, schreckling, like, home, build, small, gas, turbines, are, used, as, auxiliary, power, units, apus, to, supply, auxiliary, power, to, larger, mobile, machines, such, as, an, aircraft, and, are, a, turboshaft, design, they, supply, industrial, gas, turbines, differ, from, aeronautical, designs, in, that, the, frames, bearings, and, blading, are, of, heavier, construction, they, are, also, much, more, closely, integrated, with, the, devices, they, power, often, an, electric, generator, and, the, secondary, energy, equipment, that, is, used, to, recover, residual, energy, largely, heat, they, range, in, size, from, portable, mobile, plants, to, large, complex, systems, weighing, more, than, a, hundred, tonnes, housed, in, purpose, built, buildings, when, the, gas, turbine, is, used, solely, for, shaft, power, its, thermal, efficiency, is, about, 30, however, it, may, be, cheaper, to, buy, electricity, than, to, generate, it, therefore, many, engines, are, used, in, chp, combined, heat, and, power, configurations, that, can, be, small, enough, to, be, integrated, into, portable, container, configurations, gas, turbines, can, be, particularly, efficient, when, waste, heat, from, the, turbine, is, recovered, by, a, heat, recovery, steam, generator, hrsg, to, power, a, conventional, steam, turbine, in, a, combined, cycle, configuration, the, 605, mw, general, electric, 9ha, achieved, a, 62, 22, efficiency, rate, with, temperatures, as, high, as, 1, 540, c, 2, 800, f, for, 2018, ge, offers, its, 826, mw, ha, at, over, 64, efficiency, in, combined, cycle, due, to, advances, in, additive, manufacturing, and, combustion, breakthroughs, up, from, 63, 7, in, 2017, orders, and, on, track, to, achieve, 65, by, the, early, 2020s, in, march, 2018, ge, power, achieved, a, 63, 08, gross, efficiency, for, its, 7ha, turbine, aeroderivative, gas, turbines, can, also, be, used, in, combined, cycles, leading, to, a, higher, efficiency, but, it, will, not, be, as, high, as, a, specifically, designed, industrial, gas, turbine, they, can, also, be, run, in, a, cogeneration, configuration, the, exhaust, is, used, for, space, or, water, heating, or, drives, an, absorption, chiller, for, cooling, the, inlet, air, and, increase, the, power, output, technology, known, as, turbine, inlet, air, cooling, another, significant, advantage, is, their, ability, to, be, turned, on, and, off, within, minutes, supplying, power, during, peak, or, unscheduled, demand, since, single, cycle, gas, turbine, only, power, plants, are, less, efficient, than, combined, cycle, plants, they, are, usually, used, as, peaking, power, plants, which, operate, anywhere, from, several, hours, per, day, to, a, few, dozen, hours, per, year, depending, on, the, electricity, demand, and, the, generating, capacity, of, the, region, in, areas, with, a, shortage, of, base, load, and, load, following, power, plant, capacity, or, with, low, fuel, costs, a, gas, turbine, powerplant, may, regularly, operate, most, hours, of, the, day, a, large, single, cycle, gas, turbine, typically, produces, 100, to, 400, megawatts, of, electric, power, and, has, 35, 40, thermodynamic, efficiency, industrial, gas, turbines, that, are, used, solely, for, mechanical, drive, or, used, in, collaboration, with, a, recovery, steam, generator, differ, from, power, generating, sets, in, that, they, are, often, smaller, and, feature, a, dual, shaft, design, as, opposed, to, a, single, shaft, the, power, range, varies, from, 1, megawatt, up, to, 50, megawatts, these, engines, are, connected, directly, or, via, a, gearbox, to, either, a, pump, or, compressor, assembly, the, majority, of, installations, are, used, within, the, oil, and, gas, industries, mechanical, drive, applications, increase, efficiency, by, around, 2, oil, and, gas, platforms, require, these, engines, to, drive, compressors, to, inject, gas, into, the, wells, to, force, oil, up, via, another, bore, or, to, compress, the, gas, for, transportation, they, are, also, often, used, to, provide, power, for, the, platform, these, platforms, do, not, need, to, use, the, engine, in, collaboration, with, a, chp, system, due, to, getting, the, gas, at, an, extremely, reduced, cost, often, free, from, burn, off, gas, the, same, companies, use, pump, sets, to, drive, the, fluids, to, land, and, across, pipelines, in, various, intervals, one, modern, development, seeks, to, improve, efficiency, in, another, way, by, separating, the, compressor, and, the, turbine, with, a, compressed, air, store, in, a, conventional, turbine, up, to, half, the, generated, power, is, used, driving, the, compressor, in, a, compressed, air, energy, storage, configuration, power, is, used, to, drive, the, compressor, and, the, compressed, air, is, released, to, operate, the, turbine, when, required, turboshaft, engines, are, used, to, drive, compressors, in, gas, pumping, stations, and, natural, gas, liquefaction, plants, they, are, also, used, in, aviation, to, power, all, but, the, smallest, modern, helicopters, and, function, as, an, auxiliary, power, unit, in, large, commercial, aircraft, a, primary, shaft, carries, the, compressor, and, its, turbine, which, together, with, a, combustor, is, called, a, gas, generator, a, separately, spinning, power, turbine, is, usually, used, to, drive, the, rotor, on, helicopters, allowing, the, gas, generator, and, power, turbine, rotor, to, spin, at, their, own, speeds, allows, more, flexibility, in, their, design, also, known, as, miniature, gas, turbines, or, micro, jets, with, this, in, mind, the, pioneer, of, modern, micro, jets, kurt, schreckling, produced, one, of, the, world, s, first, micro, turbines, the, fd3, 67, this, engine, can, produce, up, to, 22, newtons, of, thrust, and, can, be, built, by, most, mechanically, minded, people, with, basic, engineering, tools, such, as, a, metal, lathe, evolved, from, piston, engine, turbochargers, aircraft, apus, or, small, jet, engines, microturbines, are, 25, to, 500, kilowatt, turbines, the, size, of, a, refrigerator, microturbines, have, around, 15, efficiencies, without, a, recuperator, 20, to, 30, with, one, and, they, can, reach, 85, combined, thermal, electrical, efficiency, in, cogeneration, most, gas, turbines, are, internal, combustion, engines, but, it, is, also, possible, to, manufacture, an, external, combustion, gas, turbine, which, is, effectively, a, turbine, version, of, a, hot, air, engine, those, systems, are, usually, indicated, as, efgt, externally, fired, gas, turbine, or, ifgt, indirectly, fired, gas, turbine, external, combustion, has, been, used, for, the, purpose, of, using, pulverized, coal, or, finely, ground, biomass, such, as, sawdust, as, a, fuel, in, the, indirect, system, a, heat, exchanger, is, used, and, only, clean, air, with, no, combustion, products, travels, through, the, power, turbine, the, thermal, efficiency, is, lower, in, the, indirect, type, of, external, combustion, however, the, turbine, blades, are, not, subjected, to, combustion, products, and, much, lower, quality, and, therefore, cheaper, fuels, are, able, to, be, used, when, external, combustion, is, used, it, is, possible, to, use, exhaust, air, from, the, turbine, as, the, primary, combustion, air, this, effectively, reduces, global, heat, losses, although, heat, losses, associated, with, the, combustion, exhaust, remain, inevitable, closed, cycle, gas, turbines, based, on, helium, or, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, also, hold, promise, for, use, with, future, high, temperature, solar, and, nuclear, power, generation, gas, turbines, are, often, used, on, ships, locomotives, helicopters, tanks, and, to, a, lesser, extent, on, cars, buses, and, motorcycles, a, key, advantage, of, jets, and, turboprops, for, airplane, propulsion, their, superior, performance, at, high, altitude, compared, to, piston, engines, particularly, naturally, aspirated, ones, is, irrelevant, in, most, automobile, applications, their, power, to, weight, advantage, though, less, critical, than, for, aircraft, is, still, important, gas, turbines, offer, a, high, powered, engine, in, a, very, small, and, light, package, however, they, are, not, as, responsive, and, efficient, as, small, piston, engines, over, the, wide, range, of, rpms, and, powers, needed, in, vehicle, applications, in, series, hybrid, vehicles, as, the, driving, electric, motors, are, mechanically, detached, from, the, electricity, generating, engine, the, responsiveness, poor, performance, at, low, speed, and, low, efficiency, at, low, output, problems, are, much, less, important, the, turbine, can, be, run, at, optimum, speed, for, its, power, output, and, batteries, and, ultracapacitors, can, supply, power, as, needed, with, the, engine, cycled, on, and, off, to, run, it, only, at, high, efficiency, the, emergence, of, the, continuously, variable, transmission, may, also, alleviate, the, responsiveness, problem, turbines, have, historically, been, more, expensive, to, produce, than, piston, engines, though, this, is, partly, because, piston, engines, have, been, mass, produced, in, huge, quantities, for, decades, while, small, gas, turbine, engines, are, rarities, however, turbines, are, mass, produced, in, the, closely, related, form, of, the, turbocharger, the, turbocharger, is, basically, a, compact, and, simple, free, shaft, radial, gas, turbine, which, is, driven, by, the, piston, engine, s, exhaust, gas, the, centripetal, turbine, wheel, drives, a, centrifugal, compressor, wheel, through, a, common, rotating, shaft, this, wheel, supercharges, the, engine, air, intake, to, a, degree, that, can, be, controlled, by, means, of, a, wastegate, or, by, dynamically, modifying, the, turbine, housing, s, geometry, as, in, a, variable, geometry, turbocharger, it, mainly, serves, as, a, power, recovery, device, which, converts, a, great, deal, of, otherwise, wasted, thermal, and, kinetic, energy, into, engine, boost, turbo, compound, engines, actually, employed, on, some, semi, trailer, trucks, are, fitted, with, blow, down, turbines, which, are, similar, in, design, and, appearance, to, a, turbocharger, except, for, the, turbine, shaft, being, mechanically, or, hydraulically, connected, to, the, engine, s, crankshaft, instead, of, to, a, centrifugal, compressor, thus, providing, additional, power, instead, of, boost, while, the, turbocharger, is, a, pressure, turbine, a, power, recovery, turbine, is, a, velocity, one, a, number, of, experiments, have, been, conducted, with, gas, turbine, powered, automobiles, the, largest, by, chrysler, more, recently, there, has, been, some, interest, in, the, use, of, turbine, engines, for, hybrid, electric, cars, for, instance, a, consortium, led, by, micro, gas, turbine, company, bladon, jets, has, secured, investment, from, the, technology, strategy, board, to, develop, an, ultra,

of, us, 185, 000, several, locomotive, classes, have, been, powered, by, gas, turbines, the, most, recent, incarnation, being, bombardier, s, jettrain, the, third, reich, wehrmacht, heer, s, development, division, the, heereswaffenamt, army, ordnance, board, studied, a, number, of, gas, turbine, engine, designs, for, use, in, tanks, starting, in, mid, 1944, the, first, gas, turbine, engine, design, intended, for, use, in, armored, fighting, vehicle, propulsion, the, bmw, 003, based, gt, 101, was, meant, for, installation, in, the, panther, tank, towards, the, end, of, the, war, a, jagdtiger, was, fitted, with, one, of, the, aforementioned, gas, turbines, the, second, use, of, a, gas, turbine, in, an, armored, fighting, vehicle, was, in, 1954, when, a, unit, pu2979, specifically, developed, for, tanks, by, c, a, parsons, and, company, was, installed, and, trialed, in, a, british, conqueror, tank, the, stridsvagn, 103, was, developed, in, the, 1950s, and, was, the, first, mass, produced, main, battle, tank, to, use, a, turbine, engine, the, boeing, t50, since, then, gas, turbine, engines, have, been, used, as, auxiliary, power, units, in, some, tanks, and, as, main, powerplants, in, soviet, russian, t, 80s, and, u, s, m1, abrams, tanks, among, others, they, are, lighter, and, smaller, than, diesel, engines, at, the, same, sustained, power, output, but, the, models, installed, to, date, are, less, fuel, efficient, than, the, equivalent, diesel, especially, at, idle, requiring, more, fuel, to, achieve, the, same, combat, range, successive, models, of, m1, have, addressed, this, problem, with, battery, packs, or, secondary, generators, to, power, the, tank, s, systems, while, stationary, saving, fuel, by, reducing, the, need, to, idle, the, main, turbine, t, 80s, can, mount, three, large, external, fuel, drums, to, extend, their, range, russia, has, stopped, production, of, the, t, 80, in, favor, of, the, diesel, powered, t, 90, based, on, the, t, 72, while, ukraine, has, developed, the, diesel, powered, t, 80ud, and, t, 84, with, nearly, the, power, of, the, gas, turbine, tank, the, french, leclerc, tank, s, diesel, powerplant, features, the, hyperbar, hybrid, supercharging, system, where, the, engine, s, turbocharger, is, completely, replaced, with, a, small, gas, turbine, which, also, works, as, an, assisted, diesel, exhaust, turbocharger, enabling, engine, rpm, independent, boost, level, control, and, a, higher, peak, boost, pressure, to, be, reached, than, with, ordinary, turbochargers, this, system, allows, a, smaller, displacement, and, lighter, engine, to, be, used, as, the, tank, s, power, plant, and, effectively, removes, turbo, lag, this, special, gas, turbine, turbocharger, can, also, work, independently, from, the, main, engine, as, an, ordinary, apu, a, turbine, is, theoretically, more, reliable, and, easier, to, maintain, than, a, piston, engine, since, it, has, a, simpler, construction, with, fewer, moving, parts, but, in, practice, turbine, parts, experience, a, higher, wear, rate, due, to, their, higher, working, speeds, the, turbine, blades, are, highly, sensitive, to, dust, and, fine, sand, so, that, in, desert, operations, air, filters, have, to, be, fitted, and, changed, several, times, daily, an, improperly, fitted, filter, or, a, bullet, or, shell, fragment, that, punctures, the, filter, can, damage, the, engine, piston, engines, especially, if, turbocharged, also, need, well, maintained, filters, but, they, are, more, resilient, if, the, filter, does, fail, like, most, modern, diesel, engines, used, in, tanks, gas, turbines, are, usually, multi, fuel, engines, gas, turbines, are, used, in, many, naval, vessels, where, they, are, valued, for, their, high, power, to, weight, ratio, and, their, ships, resulting, acceleration, and, ability, to, get, underway, quickly, the, first, gas, turbine, powered, naval, vessel, was, the,

first, large, ships, in, the, world, to, be, powered, solely, by, gas, turbines, the, danish, navy, had, 6, s, l, ven, class, torpedo, boats, the, export, version, of, the, british, brave, class, fast, patrol, boat, in, service, from, 1965, to, 1990, which, had, 3, bristol, proteus, later, rr, proteus, marine, gas, turbines, rated, at, 9, 510, kw, 12, 750, shp, combined, plus, two, general, motors, diesel, engines, rated, at, 340, kw, 460, shp, for, better, fuel, economy, at, slower, speeds, and, they, also, produced, 10, willemoes, class, torpedo, guided, missile, boats, in, service, from, 1974, to, 2000, which, had, 3, rolls, royce, marine, proteus, gas, turbines, also, rated, at, 9, 510, kw, 12, 750, shp, same, as, the, s, l, ven, class, boats, and, 2, general, motors, diesel, engines, rated, at, 600, kw, 800, shp, also, for, improved, fuel, economy, at, slow, speeds, the, swedish, navy, produced, 6, spica, class, torpedo, boats, between, 1966, and, 1967, powered, by, 3, bristol, siddeley, proteus, 1282, turbines, each, delivering, 3, 210, kw, 4, 300, shp, they, were, later, joined, by, 12, upgraded, norrk, ping, class, ships, still, with, the, same, engines, with, their, aft, torpedo, tubes, replaced, by, antishipping, missiles, they, served, as, missile, boats, until, the, last, was, retired, in, 2005, the, finnish, navy, commissioned, two, turunmaa, class, corvettes, turunmaa, and, karjala, in, 1968, they, were, equipped, with, one, 16, 410, kw, 22, 000, shp, rolls, royce, olympus, tm1, gas, turbine, and, three, w, rtsil, marine, diesels, for, slower, speeds, they, were, the, fastest, vessels, in, the, finnish, navy, they, regularly, achieved, speeds, of, 35, knots, and, 37, 3, knots, during, sea, trials, the, turunmaa, s, were, decommissioned, in, 2002, karjala, is, today, a, museum, ship, in, turku, and, turunmaa, serves, as, a, floating, machine, shop, and, training, ship, for, satakunta, polytechnical, college, the, next, series, of, major, naval, vessels, were, the, four, canadian, iroquois, class, helicopter, carrying, destroyers, first, commissioned, in, 1972, they, used, 2, ft, 4, main, propulsion, engines, 2, ft, 12, cruise, engines, and, 3, solar, saturn, 750, kw, generators, the, first, u, s, gas, turbine, powered, ship, was, the, u, s, coast, guard, s, point, thatcher, a, cutter, commissioned, in, 1961, that, was, powered, by, two, 750, kw, 1, 000, shp, turbines, utilizing, controllable, pitch, propellers, the, larger, hamilton, class, high, endurance, cutters, was, the, first, class, of, larger, cutters, to,

and, arleigh, burke, class, destroyers, and, ticonderoga, class, guided, missile, cruisers, uss, makin, island, a, modified, wasp, class, amphibious, assault, ship, is, to, be, the, navy, s, first, amphibious, assault, ship, powered, by, gas, turbines, the, marine, gas, turbine, operates, in, a, more, corrosive, atmosphere, due, to, the, presence, of, sea, salt, in, air, and, fuel, and, use, of, cheaper, fuels, up, to, the, late, 1940s, much, of, the, progress, on, marine, gas, turbines, all, over, the, world, took, place, in, design, offices, and, engine, builder, s, workshops, and, development, work, was, led, by, the, british, royal, navy, and, other, navies, while, interest, in, the, gas, turbine, for, marine, purposes, both, naval, and, mercantile, continued, to, increase, the, lack, of, availability, of, the, results, of, operating, experience, on, early, gas, turbine, projects, limited, the, number, of, new, ventures, on, seagoing, commercial, vessels, being, embarked, upon, in, 1951, the, diesel, electric, oil, tanker, auris, 12, 290, deadweight, tonnage, dwt, was, used, to, obtain, operating, experience, with, a, main, propulsion, gas, turbine, under, service, conditions, at, sea, and, so, became, the, first, ocean, going, merchant, ship, to, be, powered, by, a, gas, turbine, built, by, hawthorn, leslie, at, hebburn, on, tyne, uk, in, accordance, with, plans, and, specifications, drawn, up, by, the, anglo, saxon, petroleum, company, and, launched, on, the, uk, s, princess, elizabeth, s, 21st, birthday, in, 1947, the, ship, was, designed, with, an, engine, room, layout, that, would, allow, for, the, experimental, use, of, heavy, fuel, in, one, of, its, high, speed, engines, as, well, as, the, future, substitution, of, one, of, its, diesel, engines, by, a, gas, turbine, the, auris, operated, commercially, as, a, tanker, for, three, and, a, half, years, with, a, diesel, electric, propulsion, unit, as, originally, commissioned, but, in, 1951, one, of, its, four, 824, kw, 1, 105, bhp, diesel, engines, which, were, known, as, faith, hope, charity, and, prudence, was, replaced, by, the, world, s, first, marine, gas, turbine, engine, a, 890, kw, 1, 200, bhp, open, cycle, gas, turbo, alternator, built, by, british, thompson, houston, company, in, rugby, following, successful, sea, trials, off, the, northumbrian, coast, the, auris, set, sail, from, hebburn, on, tyne, in, october, 1951, bound, for, port, arthur, in, the, us, and, then, curacao, in, the, southern, caribbean, returning, to, avonmouth, after, 44, days, at, sea, successfully, completing, her, historic, trans, atlantic, crossing, during, this, time, at, sea, the, gas, turbine, burnt, diesel, fuel, and, operated, without, an, involuntary, stop, or, mechanical, difficulty, of, any, kind, she, subsequently, visited, swansea, hull, rotterdam, oslo, and, southampton, covering, a, total, of, 13, 211, nautical, miles, the, auris, then, had, all, of, its, power, plants, replaced, with, a, 3, 910, kw, 5, 250, shp, directly, coupled, gas, turbine, to, become, the, first, civilian, ship, to, operate, solely, on, gas, turbine, power, despite, the, success, of, this, early, experimental, voyage, the, gas, turbine, did, not, replace, the, diesel, engine, as, the, propulsion, plant, for, large, merchant, ships, at, constant, cruising, speeds, the, diesel, engine, simply, had, no, peer, in, the, vital, area, of, fuel, economy, the, gas, turbine, did, have, more, success, in, royal, navy, ships, and, the, other, naval, fleets, of, the, world, where, sudden, and, rapid, changes, of, speed, are, required, by, warships, in, action, the, united, states, maritime, commission, were, looking, for, options, to, update, wwii, liberty, ships, and, heavy, duty, gas, turbines, were, one, of, those, selected, in, 1956, the, john, sergeant, was, lengthened, and, equipped, with, a, general, electric, 4, 900, kw, 6, 600, shp, hd, gas, turbine, with, exhaust, gas, regeneration, reduction, gearing, and, a, variable, pitch, propeller, it, operated, for, 9, 700, hours, using, residual, fuel, bunker, c, for, 7, 000, hours, fuel, efficiency, was, on, a, par, with, steam, propulsion, at, 0, 318, kg, kw, 0, 523, lb, hp, per, hour, and, power, output, was, higher, than, expected, at, 5, 603, kw, 7, 514, shp, due, to, the, ambient, temperature, of, the, north, sea, route, being, lower, than, the, design, temperature, of, the, gas, turbine, this, gave, the, ship, a, speed, capability, of, 18, knots, up, from, 11, knots, with, the, original, power, plant, and, well, in, excess, of, the, 15, knot, targeted, the, ship, made, its, first, transatlantic, crossing, with, an, average, speed, of, 16, 8, knots, in, spite, of, some, rough, weather, along, the, way, suitable, bunker, c, fuel, was, only, available, at, limited, ports, because, the, quality, of, the, fuel, was, of, a, critical, nature, the, fuel, oil, also, had, to, be, treated, on, board, to, reduce, contaminants, and, this, was, a, labor, intensive, process, that, was, not, suitable, for, automation, at, the, time, ultimately, the, variable, pitch, propeller, which, was, of, a, new, and, untested, design, ended, the, trial, as, three, consecutive, annual, inspections, revealed, stress, cracking, this, did, not, reflect, poorly, on, the, marine, propulsion, gas, turbine, concept, though, and, the, trial, was, a, success, overall, the, success, of, this, trial, opened, the, way, for, more, development, by, ge, on, the, use, of, hd, gas, turbines, for, marine, use, with, heavy, fuels, the, john, sergeant, was, scrapped, in, 1972, at, portsmouth, pa, boeing, launched, its, first, passenger, carrying, waterjet, propelled, hydrofoil, boeing, 929, in, april, 1974, those, ships, were, powered, by, two, allison, 501, kf, gas, turbines, between, 1971, and, 1981, seatrain, lines, operated, a, scheduled, container, service, between, ports, on, the, eastern, seaboard, of, the, united, states, and, ports, in, northwest, europe, across, the, north, atlantic, with, four, container, ships, of, 26, 000, tonnes, dwt, those, ships, were, powered, by, twin, pratt, whitney, gas, turbines, of, the, ft, 4, series, the, four, ships, in, the, class, were, named, euroliner, eurofreighter, asialiner, and, asiafreighter, following, the, dramatic, organization, of, the, petroleum, exporting, countries, opec, price, increases, of, the, mid, 1970s, operations, were, constrained, by, rising, fuel, costs, some, modification, of, the, engine, systems, on, those, ships, was, undertaken, to, permit, the, burning, of, a, lower, grade, of, fuel, i, e, marine, diesel, reduction, of, fuel, costs, was, successful, using, a, different, untested, fuel, in, a, marine, gas, turbine, but, maintenance, costs, increased, with, the, fuel, change, after, 1981, the, ships, were, sold, and, refitted, with, what, at, the, time, was, more, economical, diesel, fueled, engines, but, the, increased, engine, size, reduced, cargo, space, the, first, passenger, ferry, to, use, a, gas, turbine, was, the, gts, finnjet, built, in, 1977, and, powered, by, two, pratt, whitney, ft, 4c, 1, dlf, turbines, generating, 55, 000, kw, 74, 000, shp, and, propelling, the, ship, to, a, speed, of, 31, knots, however, the, finnjet, also, illustrated, the, shortcomings, of, gas, turbine, propulsion, in, commercial, craft, as, high, fuel, prices, made, operating, her, unprofitable, after, four, years, of, service, additional, diesel, engines, were, installed, on, the, ship, to, reduce, running, costs, during, the, off, season, the, finnjet, was, also, the, first, ship, with, a, combined, diesel, electric, and, gas, propulsion, another, example, of, commercial, use, of, gas, turbines, in, a, passenger, ship, is, stena, line, s, hss, class, fastcraft, ferries, hss, 1500, class, stena, explorer, stena, voyager, and, stena, discovery, vessels, use, combined, gas, and, gas, setups, of, twin, ge, lm2500, plus, ge, lm1600, power, for, a, total, of, 68, 000, kw, 91, 000, shp, the, slightly, smaller, hss, 900, class, stena, carisma, uses, twin, abb, stal, gt35, turbines, rated, at, 34, 000, kw, 46, 000, shp, gross, the, stena, discovery, was, withdrawn, from, service, in, 2007, another, victim, of, too, high, fuel, costs, in, july, 2000, the, millennium, became, the, first, cruise, ship, to, be, powered, by, both, gas, and, steam, turbines, the, ship, featured, two, general, electric, lm2500, gas, turbine, generators, whose, exhaust, heat, was, used, to, operate, a, steam, turbine, generator, in, a, coges, combined, gas, electric, and, steam, configuration, propulsion, was, provided, by, two, electrically, driven, rolls, royce, mermaid, azimuth, pods, the, liner, rms, queen, mary, 2, uses, a, combined, diesel, and, gas, configuration, in, marine, racing, applications, the, 2010, c5000, mystic, catamaran, miss, geico, uses, two, lycoming, t, 55, turbines, for, its, power, system, gas, turbine, technology, has, steadily, advanced, since, its, inception, and, continues, to, evolve, development, is, actively, producing, both, smaller, gas, turbines, and, more, powerful, and, efficient, engines, aiding, in, these, advances, are, computer, based, design, specifically, computational, fluid, dynamics, and, finite, element, analysis, and, the, development, of, advanced, materials, base, materials, with, superior, high, temperature, strength, e, g, single, crystal, superalloys, that, exhibit, yield, strength, anomaly, or, thermal, barrier, coatings, that, protect, the, structural, material, from, ever, higher, temperatures, these, advances, allow, higher, compression, ratios, and, turbine, inlet, temperatures, more, efficient, combustion, and, better, cooling, of, engine, parts, computational, fluid, dynamics, cfd, has, contributed, to, substantial, improvements, in, the, performance, and, efficiency, of, gas, turbine, engine, components, through, enhanced, understanding, of, the, complex, viscous, flow, and, heat, transfer, phenomena, involved, for, this, reason, cfd, is, one, of, the, key, computational, tools, used, in, design, and, development, of, gas, turbine, engines, the, simple, cycle, efficiencies, of, early, gas, turbines, were, practically, doubled, by, incorporating, inter, cooling, regeneration, or, recuperation, and, reheating, these, improvements, of, course, come, at, the, expense, of, increased, initial, and, operation, costs, and, they, cannot, be, justified, unless, the, decrease, in, fuel, costs, offsets, the, increase, in, other, costs, the, relatively, low, fuel, prices, the, general, desire, in, the, industry, to, minimize, installation, costs, and, the, tremendous, increase, in, the, simple, cycle, efficiency, to, about, 40, percent, left, little, desire, for, opting, for, these, modifications, on, the, emissions, side, the, challenge, is, to, increase, turbine, inlet, temperatures, while, at, the, same, time, reducing, peak, flame, temperature, in, order, to, achieve, lower, nox, emissions, and, meet, the, latest, emission, regulations, in, may, 2011, mitsubishi, heavy, industries, achieved, a, turbine, inlet, temperature, of, 1, 600, c, 2, 900, f, on, a, 320, megawatt, gas, turbine, and, 460, mw, in, gas, turbine, combined, cycle, power, generation, applications, in, which, gross, thermal, efficiency, exceeds, 60, compliant, foil, bearings, were, commercially, introduced, to, gas, turbines, in, the, 1990s, these, can, withstand, over, a, hundred, thousand, start, stop, cycles, and, have, eliminated, the, need, for, an, oil, system, the, application, of, microelectronics, and, power, switching, technology, have, enabled, the, development, of, commercially, viable, electricity, generation, by, microturbines, for, distribution, and, vehicle, propulsion, in, 2013, general, electric, started, the, development, of, the, ge9x, with, a, compression, ratio, of, 61, 1, the, following, are, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, gas, turbine, engines, advantages, include, disadvantages, include, british, german, other, national, and, international, test, codes, are, used, to, standardize, the, procedures, and, definitions, used, to, test, gas, turbines, selection, of, the, test, code, to, be, used, is, an, agreement, between, the, purchaser, and, the, manufacturer, and, has, some, significance, to, the, design, of, the, turbine, and, associated, systems, in, the, united, states, asme, has, produced, several, performance, test, codes, on, gas, turbines, this, includes, asme, ptc, 22, 2014, these, asme, performance, test, codes, have, gained, international, recognition, and, acceptance, for, testing, gas, turbines, the, single, most, important, and, differentiating, characteristic, of, asme, performance, test, codes, including, ptc, 22, is, that, the, test, uncertainty, of, the, measurement, indicates, the, quality, of, the, test, and, is, not, to, be, used, as, a, commercial, tolerance
