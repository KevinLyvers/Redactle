a, cultivar, is, a, kind, of, cultivated, plant, that, people, have, selected, for, desired, traits, and, which, retains, those, traits, when, propagated, methods, used, to, propagate, cultivars, include, division, root, and, stem, cuttings, offsets, grafting, tissue, culture, or, carefully, controlled, seed, production, most, cultivars, arise, from, deliberate, human, manipulation, but, some, originate, from, wild, plants, that, have, distinctive, characteristics, cultivar, names, are, chosen, according, to, rules, of, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, icncp, and, not, all, cultivated, plants, qualify, as, cultivars, horticulturists, generally, believe, the, word, cultivar, was, coined, as, a, term, meaning, cultivated, variety, popular, ornamental, plants, like, roses, camellias, daffodils, rhododendrons, and, azaleas, are, commonly, cultivars, produced, by, breeding, and, selection, or, as, sports, for, floral, colour, or, size, plant, form, or, other, desirable, characteristics, similarly, the, world, s, agricultural, food, crops, are, almost, exclusively, cultivars, that, have, been, selected, for, characters, such, as, improved, yield, flavour, and, resistance, to, disease, and, very, few, wild, plants, are, now, used, as, food, sources, trees, used, in, forestry, are, also, special, selections, grown, for, their, enhanced, quality, and, yield, of, timber, cultivars, form, a, major, part, of, liberty, hyde, bailey, s, broader, group, the, cultigen, which, is, defined, as, a, plant, whose, origin, or, selection, is, primarily, due, to, intentional, human, activity, a, cultivar, is, not, the, same, as, a, botanical, variety, which, is, a, taxonomic, rank, below, subspecies, and, there, are, differences, in, the, rules, for, creating, and, using, the, names, of, botanical, varieties, and, cultivars, in, recent, times, the, naming, of, cultivars, has, been, complicated, by, the, use, of, statutory, patents, for, plants, and, recognition, of, plant, breeders, rights, the, international, union, for, the, protection, of, new, varieties, of, plants, upov, french, union, internationale, pour, la, protection, des, obtentions, v, g, tales, offers, legal, protection, of, plant, cultivars, to, persons, or, organisations, that, introduce, new, cultivars, to, commerce, upov, requires, that, a, cultivar, be, distinct, uniform, and, stable, to, be, distinct, it, must, have, characters, that, easily, distinguish, it, from, any, other, known, cultivar, to, be, uniform, and, stable, the, cultivar, must, retain, these, characters, in, repeated, propagation, the, naming, of, cultivars, is, an, important, aspect, of, cultivated, plant, taxonomy, and, the, correct, naming, of, a, cultivar, is, prescribed, by, the, rules, and, recommendations, of, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, icncp, commonly, denominated, the, cultivated, plant, code, a, cultivar, is, given, a, cultivar, name, which, consists, of, the, scientific, latin, botanical, name, followed, by, a, cultivar, epithet, the, cultivar, epithet, is, usually, in, a, vernacular, language, the, word, cultivar, originated, from, the, need, to, distinguish, between, wild, plants, and, those, with, characteristics, that, arose, in, cultivation, presently, denominated, cultigens, this, distinction, dates, to, the, greek, philosopher, theophrastus, 370, 285, bc, the, father, of, botany, who, was, keenly, aware, of, this, difference, botanical, historian, alan, morton, noted, that, theophrastus, in, his, historia, plantarum, enquiry, into, plants, had, an, inkling, of, the, limits, of, culturally, induced, phenotypic, changes, and, of, the, importance, of, genetic, constitution, historia, plantarum, book, 3, 2, 2, and, causa, plantarum, book, 1, 9, 3, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, uses, as, its, starting, point, for, modern, botanical, nomenclature, the, latin, names, in, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, species, plantarum, tenth, edition, and, genera, plantarum, fifth, edition, in, species, plantarum, linnaeus, enumerated, all, plants, known, to, him, either, directly, or, from, his, extensive, reading, he, recognised, the, rank, of, varietas, botanical, variety, a, rank, below, that, of, species, and, subspecies, and, he, indicated, these, varieties, with, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, such, as, and, before, the, varietal, name, rather, than, using, the, abbreviation, var, as, is, the, present, convention, most, of, the, varieties, that, linnaeus, enumerated, were, of, garden, origin, rather, than, being, wild, plants, in, time, the, need, to, distinguish, between, wild, plants, and, those, with, variations, that, had, been, cultivated, increased, in, the, nineteenth, century, many, garden, derived, plants, were, given, horticultural, names, sometimes, in, latin, and, sometimes, in, a, vernacular, language, from, circa, the, 1900s, cultivated, plants, in, europe, were, recognised, in, the, scandinavian, germanic, and, slavic, literature, as, stamm, or, sorte, but, these, words, could, not, be, used, internationally, because, by, international, agreement, any, new, denominations, had, to, be, in, latin, in, the, twentieth, century, an, improved, international, nomenclature, was, proposed, for, cultivated, plants, liberty, hyde, bailey, of, cornell, university, in, new, york, united, states, created, the, word, cultivar, in, 1923, when, he, wrote, that, the, cultigen, is, a, species, or, its, equivalent, that, has, appeared, under, domestication, the, plant, is, cultigenous, i, now, propose, another, name, cultivar, for, a, botanical, variety, or, for, a, race, subordinate, to, species, that, has, originated, under, cultivation, it, is, not, necessarily, however, referable, to, a, recognized, botanical, species, it, is, essentially, the, equivalent, of, the, botanical, variety, except, in, respect, to, its, origin, in, that, essay, bailey, used, only, the, rank, of, species, for, the, cultigen, but, it, was, obvious, to, him, that, many, domesticated, plants, were, more, like, botanical, varieties, than, species, and, that, realization, appears, to, have, motivated, the, suggestion, of, the, new, category, of, cultivar, bailey, created, the, word, cultivar, it, is, generally, assumed, to, be, a, blend, of, culti, vated, and, var, iety, but, bailey, never, explicitly, stated, the, etymology, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, word, is, actually, a, blend, of, culti, gen, and, var, iety, the, neologism, cultivar, was, promoted, as, euphonious, and, free, from, ambiguity, the, first, cultivated, plant, code, of, 1953, subsequently, commended, its, use, and, by, 1960, it, had, achieved, common, international, acceptance, the, words, cultigen, and, cultivar, may, be, confused, with, each, other, a, cultigen, is, any, plant, that, is, deliberately, selected, for, or, altered, in, cultivation, as, opposed, to, an, indigen, the, cultivated, plant, code, states, that, cultigens, are, maintained, as, recognisable, entities, solely, by, continued, propagation, cultigens, can, have, names, at, any, of, many, taxonomic, ranks, including, those, of, grex, species, cultivar, group, variety, form, and, cultivar, and, they, may, be, plants, that, have, been, altered, in, cultivation, including, by, genetic, modification, but, have, not, been, formally, denominated, a, cultigen, or, a, component, of, a, cultigen, can, be, accepted, as, a, cultivar, if, it, is, recognisable, and, has, stable, characters, therefore, all, cultivars, are, cultigens, because, they, are, cultivated, but, not, all, cultigens, are, cultivars, because, some, cultigens, have, not, been, formally, distinguished, and, named, as, cultivars, the, cultivated, plant, code, notes, that, the, word, cultivar, is, used, in, two, different, senses, first, as, a, classification, category, the, cultivar, is, defined, in, article, 2, of, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, 2009, 8th, edition, as, follows, the, basic, category, of, cultivated, plants, whose, nomenclature, is, governed, by, this, code, is, the, cultivar, there, are, two, other, classification, categories, for, cultigens, the, grex, and, the, group, the, code, then, defines, a, cultivar, as, a, taxonomic, unit, within, the, classification, category, of, cultivar, this, is, the, sense, of, cultivar, that, is, most, generally, understood, and, which, is, used, as, a, general, definition, a, cultivar, is, an, assemblage, of, plants, that, a, has, been, selected, for, a, particular, character, or, combination, of, characters, b, is, distinct, uniform, and, stable, in, those, characters, and, c, when, propagated, by, appropriate, means, retains, those, characters, which, plants, are, chosen, to, be, named, as, cultivars, is, simply, a, matter, of, convenience, as, the, category, was, created, to, serve, the, practical, needs, of, horticulture, agriculture, and, forestry, members, of, a, particular, cultivar, are, not, necessarily, genetically, identical, the, cultivated, plant, code, emphasizes, that, different, cultivated, plants, may, be, accepted, as, different, cultivars, even, if, they, have, the, same, genome, while, cultivated, plants, with, different, genomes, may, be, regarded, as, the, same, cultivar, the, production, of, cultivars, generally, entails, considerable, human, involvement, although, in, a, few, cases, it, may, be, as, little, as, simply, selecting, variation, from, plants, growing, in, the, wild, whether, by, collecting, growing, tissue, to, propagate, from, or, by, gathering, seed, cultivars, generally, occur, as, ornamentals, and, food, crops, malus, granny, smith, and, malus, red, delicious, are, cultivars, of, apples, propagated, by, cuttings, or, grafting, lactuca, red, sails, and, lactuca, great, lakes, are, lettuce, cultivars, propagated, by, seeds, named, cultivars, of, hosta, and, hemerocallis, plants, are, cultivars, produced, by, micropropagation, or, division, cultivars, that, are, produced, asexually, are, genetically, identical, and, known, as, clones, this, includes, plants, propagated, by, division, layering, cuttings, grafts, and, budding, the, propagating, material, may, be, taken, from, a, particular, part, of, the, plant, such, as, a, lateral, branch, or, from, a, particular, phase, of, the, life, cycle, such, as, a, juvenile, leaf, or, from, aberrant, growth, as, occurs, with, witch, s, broom, plants, whose, distinctive, characters, are, derived, from, the, presence, of, an, intracellular, organism, may, also, form, a, cultivar, provided, the, characters, are, reproduced, reliably, from, generation, to, generation, plants, of, the, same, chimera, which, have, mutant, tissues, close, to, normal, tissue, or, graft, chimeras, which, have, vegetative, tissue, from, different, kinds, of, plants, and, which, originate, by, grafting, may, also, constitute, a, cultivar, some, cultivars, come, true, from, seed, retaining, their, distinguishing, characteristics, when, grown, from, seed, such, plants, are, termed, a, variety, selection, or, strain, but, these, are, ambiguous, and, confusing, words, that, are, best, avoided, in, general, asexually, propagated, cultivars, grown, from, seeds, produce, highly, variable, seedling, plants, and, should, not, be, labelled, with, or, sold, under, the, parent, cultivar, s, name, seed, raised, cultivars, may, be, produced, by, uncontrolled, pollination, when, characteristics, that, are, distinct, uniform, and, stable, are, passed, from, parents, to, progeny, some, are, produced, as, lines, that, are, produced, by, repeated, self, fertilization, or, inbreeding, or, multilines, that, are, made, up, of, several, closely, related, lines, sometimes, they, are, f1, hybrids, which, are, the, result, of, a, deliberate, repeatable, single, cross, between, two, pure, lines, a, few, f2, hybrid, seed, cultivars, also, exist, such, as, achillea, summer, berries, some, cultivars, are, agamospermous, plants, which, retain, their, genetic, composition, and, characteristics, under, reproduction, occasionally, cultivars, are, raised, from, seed, of, a, specially, selected, provenance, for, example, the, seed, may, be, taken, from, plants, that, are, resistant, to, a, particular, disease, genetically, modified, plants, with, characteristics, resulting, from, the, deliberate, implantation, of, genetic, material, from, a, different, germplasm, may, form, a, cultivar, however, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, notes, in, practice, such, an, assemblage, is, often, marketed, from, one, or, more, lines, or, multilines, that, have, been, genetically, modified, these, lines, or, multilines, often, remain, in, a, constant, state, of, development, which, makes, the, naming, of, such, an, assemblage, as, a, cultivar, a, futile, exercise, however, retired, transgenic, varieties, such, as, the, fish, tomato, which, are, no, longer, being, developed, do, not, run, into, this, obstacle, and, can, be, given, a, cultivar, name, cultivars, may, be, selected, because, of, a, change, in, the, ploidy, level, of, a, plant, which, may, produce, more, desirable, characteristics, every, unique, cultivar, has, a, unique, name, within, its, denomination, class, which, is, almost, always, the, genus, names, of, cultivars, are, regulated, by, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, and, may, be, registered, with, an, international, cultivar, registration, authority, icra, there, are, sometimes, separate, registration, authorities, for, different, plant, types, such, as, roses, and, camellias, in, addition, cultivars, may, be, associated, with, commercial, marketing, names, referred, to, in, the, cultivated, plant, code, as, trade, designations, see, below, a, cultivar, name, consists, of, a, botanical, name, of, a, genus, species, infraspecific, taxon, interspecific, hybrid, or, intergeneric, hybrid, followed, by, a, cultivar, epithet, the, cultivar, epithet, is, enclosed, by, single, quotes, it, should, not, be, italicized, if, the, botanical, name, is, italicized, and, each, of, the, words, within, the, epithet, is, capitalized, with, some, permitted, exceptions, such, as, conjunctions, it, is, permissible, to, place, a, cultivar, epithet, after, a, common, name, provided, the, common, name, is, botanically, unambiguous, cultivar, epithets, published, before, 1, january, 1959, were, often, given, a, latin, form, and, can, be, readily, confused, with, the, specific, epithets, in, botanical, names, after, that, date, newly, coined, cultivar, epithets, must, be, in, a, modern, vernacular, language, to, distinguish, them, from, botanical, epithets, for, example, the, full, cultivar, name, of, the, king, edward, potato, is, solanum, tuberosum, king, edward, king, edward, is, the, cultivar, epithet, which, according, to, the, rules, of, the, cultivated, plant, code, is, bounded, by, single, quotation, marks, for, patented, or, trademarked, plant, product, lines, developed, from, a, given, cultivar, the, commercial, product, name, is, typically, indicated, by, the, symbols, tm, or, or, is, presented, in, capital, letters, with, no, quotation, marks, following, the, cultivar, name, as, in, the, following, example, where, bloomerang, is, the, commercial, name, and, penda, is, the, cultivar, epithet, syringa, penda, bloomerang, although, cv, has, not, been, permitted, by, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, since, the, 1995, edition, it, is, still, widely, used, and, recommended, by, other, authorities, where, several, very, similar, cultivars, exist, they, can, be, associated, into, a, group, formerly, cultivar, group, as, group, names, are, used, with, cultivar, names, it, is, necessary, to, understand, their, way, of, presentation, group, names, are, presented, in, normal, type, and, the, first, letter, of, each, word, capitalised, as, for, cultivars, but, they, are, not, placed, in, single, quotes, when, used, in, a, name, the, first, letter, of, the, word, group, is, itself, capitalized, since, the, 1990s, there, has, been, an, increasing, use, of, legal, protection, for, newly, produced, cultivars, plant, breeders, expect, legal, protection, for, the, cultivars, they, produce, according, to, proponents, of, such, protections, if, other, growers, can, immediately, propagate, and, sell, these, cultivars, as, soon, as, they, come, on, the, market, the, breeder, s, benefit, is, largely, lost, legal, protection, for, cultivars, is, obtained, through, the, use, of, plant, breeders, rights, and, plant, patents, but, the, specific, legislation, and, procedures, needed, to, take, advantage, of, this, protection, vary, from, country, to, country, the, use, of, legal, protection, for, cultivars, can, be, controversial, particularly, for, food, crops, that, are, staples, in, developing, countries, or, for, plants, selected, from, the, wild, and, propagated, for, sale, without, any, additional, breeding, work, some, people, consider, this, practice, unethical, the, formal, scientific, name, of, a, cultivar, like, solanum, tuberosum, king, edward, is, a, way, of, uniquely, designating, a, particular, kind, of, plant, this, scientific, name, is, in, the, public, domain, and, cannot, be, legally, protected, plant, retailers, wish, to, maximize, their, share, of, the, market, and, one, way, of, doing, this, is, to, replace, the, latin, scientific, names, on, plant, labels, in, retail, outlets, with, appealing, marketing, names, that, are, easy, to, use, pronounce, and, remember, marketing, names, lie, outside, the, scope, of, the, cultivated, plant, code, which, refers, to, them, as, trade, designations, if, a, retailer, or, wholesaler, has, the, sole, legal, rights, to, a, marketing, name, then, that, may, offer, a, sales, advantage, plants, protected, by, plant, breeders, rights, pbr, may, have, a, true, cultivar, name, the, recognized, scientific, name, in, the, public, domain, and, a, commercial, synonym, an, additional, marketing, name, that, is, legally, protected, an, example, would, be, rosa, fascination, poulmax, in, which, rosa, is, the, genus, fascination, is, the, trade, designation, and, poulmax, is, scientific, cultivar, name, because, a, name, that, is, attractive, in, one, language, may, have, less, appeal, in, another, country, a, plant, may, be, given, different, selling, names, from, country, to, country, quoting, the, original, cultivar, name, allows, the, correct, identification, of, cultivars, around, the, world, the, main, body, coordinating, plant, breeders, rights, is, the, international, union, for, the, protection, of, new, varieties, of, plants, union, internationale, pour, la, protection, des, obtentions, v, g, tales, upov, and, this, organization, maintains, a, database, of, new, cultivars, protected, by, pbr, in, all, countries, an, international, cultivar, registration, authority, icra, is, a, voluntary, non, statutory, organization, appointed, by, the, commission, for, nomenclature, and, cultivar, registration, of, the, international, society, of, horticultural, science, icras, are, generally, formed, by, societies, and, institutions, specializing, in, particular, plant, genera, such, as, dahlia, or, rhododendron, and, are, currently, located, in, europe, north, america, china, india, singapore, australia, new, zealand, south, africa, and, puerto, rico, each, icra, produces, an, annual, report, and, its, reappointment, is, considered, every, four, years, the, main, task, is, to, maintain, a, register, of, the, names, within, the, group, of, interest, and, where, possible, this, is, published, and, placed, in, the, public, domain, one, major, aim, is, to, prevent, the, duplication, of, cultivar, and, group, epithets, within, a, genus, as, well, as, ensuring, that, names, are, in, accord, with, the, latest, edition, of, the, cultivated, plant, code, in, this, way, over, the, last, 50, years, or, so, icras, have, contributed, to, the, stability, of, cultivated, plant, nomenclature, in, recent, times, many, icras, have, also, recorded, trade, designations, and, trademarks, used, in, labelling, plant, material, to, avoid, confusion, with, established, names, new, names, and, other, relevant, data, are, collected, by, and, submitted, to, the, icra, and, in, most, cases, there, is, no, cost, the, icra, then, checks, each, new, epithet, to, ensure, that, it, has, not, been, used, before, and, that, it, conforms, with, the, cultivated, plant, code, each, icra, also, ensures, that, new, names, are, formally, established, i, e, published, in, hard, copy, with, a, description, in, a, dated, publication, they, record, details, about, the, plant, such, as, parentage, the, names, of, those, concerned, with, its, development, and, introduction, and, a, basic, description, highlighting, its, distinctive, characters, icras, are, not, responsible, for, assessing, the, distinctiveness, of, the, plant, in, question, most, icras, can, be, contacted, electronically, and, many, maintain, web, sites, for, an, up, to, date, listing
