the, first, evidence, of, horses, in, warfare, dates, from, eurasia, between, 4000, and, 3000, bc, a, sumerian, illustration, of, warfare, from, 2500, bc, depicts, some, type, of, equine, pulling, wagons, by, 1600, bc, improved, harness, and, chariot, designs, made, chariot, warfare, common, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, and, the, earliest, written, training, manual, for, war, horses, was, a, guide, for, training, chariot, horses, written, about, 1350, bc, as, formal, cavalry, tactics, replaced, the, chariot, so, did, new, training, methods, and, by, 360, bc, the, greek, cavalry, officer, xenophon, had, written, an, extensive, treatise, on, horsemanship, the, effectiveness, of, horses, in, battle, was, also, revolutionized, by, improvements, in, technology, such, as, the, invention, of, the, saddle, the, stirrup, and, the, horse, collar, many, different, types, and, sizes, of, horses, were, used, in, war, depending, on, the, form, of, warfare, the, type, used, varied, with, whether, the, horse, was, being, ridden, or, driven, and, whether, they, were, being, used, for, reconnaissance, cavalry, charges, raiding, communication, or, supply, throughout, history, mules, and, donkeys, as, well, as, horses, played, a, crucial, role, in, providing, support, to, armies, in, the, field, horses, were, well, suited, to, the, warfare, tactics, of, the, nomadic, cultures, from, the, steppes, of, eastern, europe, and, central, asia, several, cultures, in, east, asia, made, extensive, use, of, cavalry, and, chariots, muslim, warriors, relied, upon, light, cavalry, in, their, campaigns, throughout, northern, africa, asia, and, europe, beginning, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, ad, europeans, used, several, types, of, war, horses, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, best, known, heavy, cavalry, warrior, of, the, period, was, the, armoured, knight, with, the, decline, of, the, knight, and, rise, of, gunpowder, in, warfare, light, cavalry, again, rose, to, prominence, used, in, both, european, warfare, and, in, the, conquest, of, the, americas, battle, cavalry, developed, to, take, on, a, multitude, of, roles, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, century, and, was, often, crucial, for, victory, in, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, americas, the, use, of, horses, and, development, of, mounted, warfare, tactics, were, learned, by, several, tribes, of, indigenous, people, and, in, turn, highly, mobile, horse, regiments, were, critical, in, the, american, civil, war, horse, cavalry, began, to, be, phased, out, after, world, war, i, in, favour, of, tank, warfare, though, a, few, horse, cavalry, units, were, still, used, into, world, war, ii, especially, as, scouts, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, horses, were, seldom, seen, in, battle, but, were, still, used, extensively, for, the, transport, of, troops, and, supplies, today, formal, battle, ready, horse, cavalry, units, have, almost, disappeared, though, the, united, states, army, special, forces, used, horses, in, battle, during, the, 2001, invasion, of, afghanistan, horses, are, still, seen, in, use, by, organized, armed, fighters, in, the, global, south, many, nations, still, maintain, small, units, of, mounted, riders, for, patrol, and, reconnaissance, and, military, horse, units, are, also, used, for, ceremonial, and, educational, purposes, horses, are, also, used, for, historical, reenactment, of, battles, law, enforcement, and, in, equestrian, competitions, derived, from, the, riding, and, training, skills, once, used, by, the, military, a, fundamental, principle, of, equine, conformation, is, form, to, function, therefore, the, type, of, horse, used, for, various, forms, of, warfare, depended, on, the, work, performed, the, weight, a, horse, needed, to, carry, or, pull, and, distance, travelled, weight, affects, speed, and, endurance, creating, a, trade, off, armour, added, protection, but, added, weight, reduced, maximum, speed, therefore, various, cultures, had, different, military, needs, in, some, situations, one, primary, type, of, horse, was, favoured, over, all, others, in, other, places, multiple, types, were, needed, warriors, would, travel, to, battle, riding, a, lighter, horse, of, greater, speed, and, endurance, and, then, switch, to, a, heavier, horse, with, greater, weight, carrying, capacity, when, wearing, heavy, armour, in, actual, combat, the, average, horse, can, carry, up, to, approximately, 30, of, its, body, weight, while, all, horses, can, pull, more, weight, than, they, can, carry, the, maximum, weight, that, horses, can, pull, varies, widely, depending, on, the, build, of, the, horse, the, type, of, vehicle, road, conditions, and, other, factors, horses, harnessed, to, a, wheeled, vehicle, on, a, paved, road, can, pull, as, much, as, eight, times, their, weight, but, far, less, if, pulling, wheelless, loads, over, unpaved, terrain, thus, horses, that, were, driven, varied, in, size, and, had, to, make, a, trade, off, between, speed, and, weight, just, as, did, riding, animals, light, horses, could, pull, a, small, war, chariot, at, speed, heavy, supply, wagons, artillery, and, support, vehicles, were, pulled, by, heavier, horses, or, a, larger, number, of, horses, the, method, by, which, a, horse, was, hitched, to, a, vehicle, also, mattered, horses, could, pull, greater, weight, with, a, horse, collar, than, they, could, with, a, breast, collar, and, even, less, with, an, ox, yoke, light, oriental, horses, such, as, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, arabian, barb, and, akhal, teke, were, used, for, warfare, that, required, speed, endurance, and, agility, such, horses, ranged, from, about, 12, hands, 48, inches, 122, cm, to, just, under, 15, hands, 60, inches, 152, cm, weighing, approximately, 360, to, 450, kilograms, 800, to, 1, 000, lb, to, move, quickly, riders, had, to, use, lightweight, tack, and, carry, relatively, light, weapons, such, as, bows, light, spears, javelins, or, later, rifles, this, was, the, original, horse, used, for, early, chariot, warfare, raiding, and, light, cavalry, relatively, light, horses, were, used, by, many, cultures, including, the, ancient, egyptians, the, mongols, the, arabs, and, the, native, americans, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, small, light, animals, were, used, to, pull, chariots, designed, to, carry, no, more, than, two, passengers, a, driver, and, a, warrior, in, the, european, middle, ages, a, lightweight, war, horse, became, known, as, the, rouncey, medium, weight, horses, developed, as, early, as, the, iron, age, with, the, needs, of, various, civilizations, to, pull, heavier, loads, such, as, chariots, capable, of, holding, more, than, two, people, and, as, light, cavalry, evolved, into, heavy, cavalry, to, carry, heavily, armoured, riders, the, scythians, were, among, the, earliest, cultures, to, produce, taller, heavier, horses, larger, horses, were, also, needed, to, pull, supply, wagons, and, later, on, artillery, pieces, in, europe, horses, were, also, used, to, a, limited, extent, to, maneuver, cannons, on, the, battlefield, as, part, of, dedicated, horse, artillery, units, medium, weight, horses, had, the, greatest, range, in, size, from, about, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, but, stocky, to, as, much, as, 16, hands, 64, inches, 163, cm, weighing, approximately, 450, to, 540, kilograms, 1, 000, to, 1, 200, lb, they, generally, were, quite, agile, in, combat, though, they, did, not, have, the, raw, speed, or, endurance, of, a, lighter, horse, by, the, middle, ages, larger, horses, in, this, class, were, sometimes, called, destriers, they, may, have, resembled, modern, baroque, or, heavy, warmblood, breeds, later, horses, similar, to, the, modern, warmblood, often, carried, european, cavalry, large, heavy, horses, weighing, from, 680, to, 910, kilograms, 1, 500, to, 2, 000, lb, the, ancestors, of, today, s, draught, horses, were, used, particularly, in, europe, from, the, middle, ages, onward, they, pulled, heavy, loads, like, supply, wagons, and, were, disposed, to, remain, calm, in, battle, some, historians, believe, they, may, have, carried, the, heaviest, armoured, knights, of, the, late, medieval, period, though, others, dispute, this, claim, indicating, that, the, destrier, or, knight, s, battle, horse, was, a, medium, weight, animal, it, is, also, disputed, whether, the, destrier, class, included, draught, animals, or, not, breeds, at, the, smaller, end, of, the, heavyweight, category, may, have, included, the, ancestors, of, the, percheron, agile, for, their, size, and, physically, able, to, maneuver, in, battle, the, british, army, s, 2nd, dragoons, in, 1813, had, 340, ponies, of, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, and, 55, ponies, of, 14, hands, 56, inches, 142, cm, the, lovat, scouts, formed, in, 1899, were, mounted, on, highland, ponies, the, british, army, recruited, 200, dales, ponies, in, world, war, ii, for, use, as, pack, and, artillery, animals, and, the, british, territorial, army, experimented, with, the, use, of, dartmoor, ponies, as, pack, animals, in, 1935, finding, them, to, be, better, than, mules, for, the, job, horses, were, not, the, only, equids, used, to, support, human, warfare, donkeys, have, been, used, as, pack, animals, from, antiquity, to, the, present, mules, were, also, commonly, used, especially, as, pack, animals, and, to, pull, wagons, but, also, occasionally, for, riding, because, mules, are, often, both, calmer, and, hardier, than, horses, they, were, particularly, useful, for, strenuous, support, tasks, such, as, hauling, supplies, over, difficult, terrain, however, under, gunfire, they, were, less, cooperative, than, horses, so, were, generally, not, used, to, haul, artillery, on, battlefields, the, size, of, a, mule, and, work, to, which, it, was, put, depended, largely, on, the, breeding, of, the, mare, that, produced, the, mule, mules, could, be, lightweight, medium, weight, or, even, when, produced, from, draught, horse, mares, of, moderate, heavy, weight, the, oldest, known, manual, on, training, horses, for, chariot, warfare, was, written, c, 1350, bc, by, the, hittite, horsemaster, kikkuli, an, ancient, manual, on, the, subject, of, training, riding, horses, particularly, for, the, ancient, greek, cavalry, is, hippike, on, horsemanship, written, about, 360, bc, by, the, greek, cavalry, officer, xenophon, and, another, early, text, was, that, of, kautilya, written, about, 323, bc, whether, horses, were, trained, to, pull, chariots, to, be, ridden, as, light, or, heavy, cavalry, or, to, carry, the, armoured, knight, much, training, was, required, to, overcome, the, horse, s, natural, instinct, to, flee, from, noise, the, smell, of, blood, and, the, confusion, of, combat, they, also, learned, to, accept, any, sudden, or, unusual, movements, of, humans, while, using, a, weapon, or, avoiding, one, horses, used, in, close, combat, may, have, been, taught, or, at, least, permitted, to, kick, strike, and, even, bite, thus, becoming, weapons, themselves, for, the, warriors, they, carried, in, most, cultures, a, war, horse, used, as, a, riding, animal, was, trained, to, be, controlled, with, limited, use, of, reins, responding, primarily, to, the, rider, s, legs, and, weight, the, horse, became, accustomed, to, any, necessary, tack, and, protective, armour, placed, upon, it, and, learned, to, balance, under, a, rider, who, would, also, be, laden, with, weapons, and, armour, developing, the, balance, and, agility, of, the, horse, was, crucial, the, origins, of, the, discipline, of, dressage, came, from, the, need, to, train, horses, to, be, both, obedient, and, manoeuvrable, the, haute, ecole, or, high, school, movements, of, classical, dressage, taught, today, at, the, spanish, riding, school, have, their, roots, in, manoeuvres, designed, for, the, battlefield, however, the, airs, above, the, ground, were, unlikely, to, have, been, used, in, actual, combat, as, most, would, have, exposed, the, unprotected, underbelly, of, the, horse, to, the, weapons, of, foot, soldiers, horses, used, for, chariot, warfare, were, not, only, trained, for, combat, conditions, but, because, many, chariots, were, pulled, by, a, team, of, two, to, four, horses, they, also, had, to, learn, to, work, together, with, other, animals, in, close, quarters, under, chaotic, conditions, horses, were, probably, ridden, in, prehistory, before, they, were, driven, however, evidence, is, scant, mostly, simple, images, of, human, figures, on, horse, like, animals, drawn, on, rock, or, clay, the, earliest, tools, used, to, control, horses, were, bridles, of, various, sorts, which, were, invented, nearly, as, soon, as, the, horse, was, domesticated, evidence, of, bit, wear, appears, on, the, teeth, of, horses, excavated, at, the, archaeology, sites, of, the, botai, culture, in, northern, kazakhstan, dated, 3500, 3000, bc, the, invention, of, the, wheel, was, a, major, technological, innovation, that, gave, rise, to, chariot, warfare, at, first, equines, both, horses, and, onagers, were, hitched, to, wheeled, carts, by, means, of, a, yoke, around, their, necks, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, of, oxen, however, such, a, design, is, incompatible, with, equine, anatomy, limiting, both, the, strength, and, mobility, of, the, animal, by, the, time, of, the, hyksos, invasions, of, egypt, c, 1600, bc, horses, were, pulling, chariots, with, an, improved, harness, design, that, made, use, of, a, breastcollar, and, breeching, which, allowed, a, horse, to, move, faster, and, pull, more, weight, even, after, the, chariot, had, become, obsolete, as, a, tool, of, war, there, still, was, a, need, for, technological, innovations, in, pulling, technologies, horses, were, needed, to, pull, heavy, loads, of, supplies, and, weapons, the, invention, of, the, horse, collar, in, china, during, the, 5th, century, ad, northern, and, southern, dynasties, allowed, horses, to, pull, greater, weight, than, they, could, when, hitched, to, a, vehicle, with, the, ox, yokes, or, breast, collars, used, in, earlier, times, the, horse, collar, arrived, in, europe, during, the, 9th, century, and, became, widespread, by, the, 12th, century, two, major, innovations, that, revolutionised, the, effectiveness, of, mounted, warriors, in, battle, were, the, saddle, and, the, stirrup, riders, quickly, learned, to, pad, their, horse, s, backs, to, protect, themselves, from, the, horse, s, spine, and, withers, and, fought, on, horseback, for, centuries, with, little, more, than, a, blanket, or, pad, on, the, horse, s, back, and, a, rudimentary, bridle, to, help, distribute, the, rider, s, weight, and, protect, the, horse, s, back, some, cultures, created, stuffed, padding, that, resembles, the, panels, of, today, s, english, saddle, both, the, scythians, and, assyrians, used, pads, with, added, felt, attached, with, a, surcingle, or, girth, around, the, horse, s, barrel, for, increased, security, and, comfort, xenophon, mentioned, the, use, of, a, padded, cloth, on, cavalry, mounts, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, bc, the, saddle, with, a, solid, framework, or, tree, provided, a, bearing, surface, to, protect, the, horse, from, the, weight, of, the, rider, but, was, not, widespread, until, the, 2nd, century, ad, however, it, made, a, critical, difference, as, horses, could, carry, more, weight, when, distributed, across, a, solid, saddle, tree, a, solid, tree, the, predecessor, of, today, s, western, saddle, also, allowed, a, more, built, up, seat, to, give, the, rider, greater, security, in, the, saddle, the, romans, are, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, solid, treed, saddle, an, invention, that, made, cavalry, particularly, effective, was, the, stirrup, a, toe, loop, that, held, the, big, toe, was, used, in, india, possibly, as, early, as, 500, bc, and, later, a, single, stirrup, was, used, as, a, mounting, aid, the, first, set, of, paired, stirrups, appeared, in, china, about, 322, ad, during, the, jin, dynasty, following, the, invention, of, paired, stirrups, which, allowed, a, rider, greater, leverage, with, weapons, as, well, as, both, increased, stability, and, mobility, while, mounted, nomadic, groups, such, as, the, mongols, adopted, this, technology, and, developed, a, decisive, military, advantage, by, the, 7th, century, due, primarily, to, invaders, from, central, asia, stirrup, technology, spread, from, asia, to, europe, the, avar, invaders, are, viewed, as, primarily, responsible, for, spreading, the, use, of, the, stirrup, into, central, europe, however, while, stirrups, were, known, in, europe, in, the, 8th, century, pictorial, and, literary, references, to, their, use, date, only, from, the, 9th, century, widespread, use, in, northern, europe, including, england, is, credited, to, the, vikings, who, spread, the, stirrup, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, to, those, areas, the, first, archaeological, evidence, of, horses, used, in, warfare, dates, from, between, 4000, and, 3000, bc, in, the, steppes, of, eurasia, in, what, today, is, ukraine, hungary, and, romania, not, long, after, domestication, of, the, horse, people, in, these, locations, began, to, live, together, in, large, fortified, towns, for, protection, from, the, threat, of, horseback, riding, raiders, who, could, attack, and, escape, faster, than, people, of, more, sedentary, cultures, could, follow, horse, mounted, nomads, of, the, steppe, and, current, day, eastern, europe, spread, indo, european, languages, as, they, conquered, other, tribes, and, groups, the, use, of, horses, in, organised, warfare, was, documented, early, in, recorded, history, one, of, the, first, depictions, is, the, war, panel, of, the, standard, of, ur, in, sumer, dated, c, 2500, bc, showing, horses, or, possibly, onagers, or, mules, pulling, a, four, wheeled, wagon, among, the, earliest, evidence, of, chariot, use, are, the, burials, of, horse, and, chariot, remains, by, the, andronovo, sintashta, petrovka, culture, in, modern, russia, and, kazakhstan, dated, to, approximately, 2000, bc, the, oldest, documentary, evidence, of, what, was, probably, chariot, warfare, in, the, ancient, near, east, is, the, old, hittite, anitta, text, of, the, 18th, century, bc, which, mentioned, 40, teams, of, horses, at, the, siege, of, salatiwara, the, hittites, became, well, known, throughout, the, ancient, world, for, their, prowess, with, the, chariot, widespread, use, of, the, chariot, in, warfare, across, most, of, eurasia, coincides, approximately, with, the, development, of, the, composite, bow, known, from, c, 1600, bc, further, improvements, in, wheels, and, axles, as, well, as, innovations, in, weaponry, soon, resulted, in, chariots, being, driven, in, battle, by, bronze, age, societies, from, china, to, egypt, the, hyksos, invaders, brought, the, chariot, to, ancient, egypt, in, the, 16th, century, bc, and, the, egyptians, adopted, its, use, from, that, time, forward, the, oldest, preserved, text, related, to, the, handling, of, war, horses, in, the, ancient, world, is, the, hittite, manual, of, kikkuli, which, dates, to, about, 1350, bc, and, describes, the, conditioning, of, chariot, horses, chariots, existed, in, the, minoan, civilization, as, they, were, inventoried, on, storage, lists, from, knossos, in, crete, dating, to, around, 1450, bc, chariots, were, also, used, in, china, as, far, back, as, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, 1050, bc, where, they, appear, in, burials, the, high, point, of, chariot, use, in, china, was, in, the, spring, and, autumn, period, 770, 476, bc, although, they, continued, in, use, up, until, the, 2nd, century, bc, descriptions, of, the, tactical, role, of, chariots, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, are, rare, the, iliad, possibly, referring, to, mycenaen, practices, used, c, 1250, bc, describes, the, use, of, chariots, for, transporting, warriors, to, and, from, battle, rather, than, for, actual, fighting, later, julius, caesar, invading, britain, in, 55, and, 54, bc, noted, british, charioteers, throwing, javelins, then, leaving, their, chariots, to, fight, on, foot, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, horses, being, ridden, in, warfare, were, horse, mounted, archers, or, javelin, throwers, dating, to, the, reigns, of, the, assyrian, rulers, ashurnasirpal, ii, and, shalmaneser, iii, however, these, riders, sat, far, back, on, their, horses, a, precarious, position, for, moving, quickly, and, the, horses, were, held, by, a, handler, on, the, ground, keeping, the, archer, free, to, use, the, bow, thus, these, archers, were, more, a, type, of, mounted, infantry, than, true, cavalry, the, assyrians, developed, cavalry, in, response, to, invasions, by, nomadic, people, from, the, north, such, as, the, cimmerians, who, entered, asia, minor, in, the, 8th, century, bc, and, took, over, parts, of, urartu, during, the, reign, of, sargon, ii, approximately, 721, bc, mounted, warriors, such, as, the, scythians, also, had, an, influence, on, the, region, in, the, 7th, century, bc, by, the, reign, of, ashurbanipal, in, 669, bc, the, assyrians, had, learned, to, sit, forward, on, their, horses, in, the, classic, riding, position, still, seen, today, and, could, be, said, to, be, true, light, cavalry, the, ancient, greeks, used, both, light, horse, scouts, and, heavy, cavalry, although, not, extensively, possibly, due, to, the, cost, of, keeping, horses, heavy, cavalry, was, believed, to, have, been, developed, by, the, ancient, persians, although, others, argue, for, the, sarmatians, by, the, time, of, darius, 558, 486, bc, persian, military, tactics, required, horses, and, riders, that, were, completely, armoured, and, selectively, bred, a, heavier, more, muscled, horse, to, carry, the, additional, weight, the, cataphract, was, a, type, of, heavily, armoured, cavalry, with, distinct, tactics, armour, and, weaponry, used, from, the, time, of, the, persians, up, until, the, middle, ages, in, ancient, greece, phillip, of, macedon, is, credited, with, developing, tactics, allowing, massed, cavalry, charges, the, most, famous, greek, heavy, cavalry, units, were, the, companion, cavalry, of, alexander, the, great, the, chinese, of, the, 4th, century, bc, during, the, warring, states, period, 403, 221, bc, began, to, use, cavalry, against, rival, states, to, fight, nomadic, raiders, from, the, north, and, west, the, chinese, of, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, developed, effective, mounted, units, cavalry, was, not, used, extensively, by, the, romans, during, the, roman, republic, period, but, by, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, they, made, use, of, heavy, cavalry, however, the, backbone, of, the, roman, army, was, the, infantry, once, gunpowder, was, invented, another, major, use, of, horses, was, as, draught, animals, for, heavy, artillery, or, cannon, in, addition, to, field, artillery, where, horse, drawn, guns, were, attended, by, gunners, on, foot, many, armies, had, artillery, batteries, where, each, gunner, was, provided, with, a, mount, horse, artillery, units, generally, used, lighter, pieces, pulled, by, six, horses, 9, pounders, were, pulled, by, eight, horses, and, heavier, artillery, pieces, needed, a, team, of, twelve, with, the, individual, riding, horses, required, for, officers, surgeons, and, other, support, staff, as, well, as, those, pulling, the, artillery, guns, and, supply, wagons, an, artillery, battery, of, six, guns, could, require, 160, to, 200, horses, horse, artillery, usually, came, under, the, command, of, cavalry, divisions, but, in, some, battles, such, as, waterloo, the, horse, artillery, were, used, as, a, rapid, response, force, repulsing, attacks, and, assisting, the, infantry, agility, was, important, the, ideal, artillery, horse, was, 1, 5, to, 1, 6, metres, 15, to, 16, hands, high, strongly, built, but, able, to, move, quickly, relations, between, steppe, nomads, and, the, settled, people, in, and, around, central, asia, were, often, marked, by, conflict, the, nomadic, lifestyle, was, well, suited, to, warfare, and, steppe, cavalry, became, some, of, the, most, militarily, potent, forces, in, the, world, only, limited, by, nomads, frequent, lack, of, internal, unity, periodically, strong, leaders, would, organise, several, tribes, into, one, force, creating, an, almost, unstoppable, power, these, unified, groups, included, the, huns, who, invaded, europe, and, under, attila, conducted, campaigns, in, both, eastern, france, and, northern, italy, over, 500, miles, apart, within, two, successive, campaign, seasons, other, unified, nomadic, forces, included, the, wu, hu, rebellions, in, china, and, the, mongol, conquest, of, much, of, eurasia, the, literature, of, ancient, india, describes, numerous, horse, nomads, some, of, the, earliest, references, to, the, use, of, horses, in, south, asian, warfare, are, puranic, texts, which, refer, to, an, attempted, invasion, of, india, by, the, joint, cavalry, forces, of, the, sakas, kambojas, yavanas, pahlavas, and, paradas, called, the, five, hordes, pa, ca, ganah, or, k, atriya, hordes, k, atriya, ganah, about, 1600, bc, they, captured, the, throne, of, ayodhya, by, dethroning, the, vedic, king, bahu, later, texts, such, as, the, mah, bh, rata, c, 950, bc, appear, to, recognise, efforts, taken, to, breed, war, horses, and, develop, trained, mounted, warriors, stating, that, the, horses, of, the, sindhu, and, kamboja, regions, were, of, the, finest, quality, and, the, kambojas, gandharas, and, yavanas, were, expert, in, fighting, from, horses, in, technological, innovation, the, early, toe, loop, stirrup, is, credited, to, the, cultures, of, india, and, may, have, been, in, use, as, early, as, 500, bc, not, long, after, the, cultures, of, mesopotamia, and, ancient, greece, clashed, with, those, of, central, asia, and, india, herodotus, 484, 425, bc, wrote, that, gandarian, mercenaries, of, the, achaemenid, empire, were, recruited, into, the, army, of, emperor, xerxes, i, of, persia, 486, 465, bc, which, he, led, against, the, greeks, a, century, later, the, men, of, the, mountain, land, from, north, of, kabul, river, served, in, the, army, of, darius, iii, of, persia, when, he, fought, against, alexander, the, great, at, arbela, in, 331, bc, in, battle, against, alexander, at, massaga, in, 326, bc, the, assakenoi, forces, included, 20, 000, cavalry, the, mudra, rakshasa, recounted, how, cavalry, of, the, shakas, yavanas, kambojas, kiratas, parasikas, and, bahlikas, helped, chandragupta, maurya, c, 320, 298, bc, defeat, the, ruler, of, magadha, and, take, the, throne, thus, laying, the, foundations, of, mauryan, dynasty, in, northern, india, mughal, cavalry, used, gunpowder, weapons, but, were, slow, to, replace, the, traditional, composite, bow, under, the, impact, of, european, military, successes, in, india, some, indian, rulers, adopted, the, european, system, of, massed, cavalry, charges, although, others, did, not, by, the, 18th, century, indian, armies, continued, to, field, cavalry, but, mainly, of, the, heavy, variety, the, chinese, used, chariots, for, horse, based, warfare, until, light, cavalry, forces, became, common, during, the, warring, states, era, 402, 221, bc, a, major, proponent, of, the, change, to, riding, horses, from, chariots, was, wu, ling, c, 320, bc, however, conservative, forces, in, china, often, opposed, change, as, cavalry, did, not, benefit, from, the, additional, cachet, attached, to, being, the, military, branch, dominated, by, the, nobility, as, in, medieval, europe, nevertheless, during, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, of, han, r, 141, 87, bc, it, is, recorded, that, 300, 000, government, owned, horses, were, insufficient, for, the, cavalry, and, baggage, trains, of, the, han, military, in, the, campaigns, to, expel, the, xiongnu, nomads, from, the, ordos, desert, qilian, mountains, khangai, mountains, and, gobi, desert, spurring, new, policies, that, encouraged, households, to, hand, over, privately, bred, horses, in, exchange, for, military, and, corvee, labor, exemptions, the, japanese, samurai, fought, as, cavalry, for, many, centuries, they, were, particularly, skilled, in, the, art, of, using, archery, from, horseback, the, archery, skills, of, mounted, samurai, were, developed, by, training, such, as, yabusame, which, originated, in, 530, ad, and, reached, its, peak, under, minamoto, no, yoritomo, 1147, 1199, ad, in, the, kamakura, period, they, switched, from, an, emphasis, on, mounted, bowmen, to, mounted, spearmen, during, the, sengoku, period, 1467, 1615, ad, during, the, period, when, various, islamic, empires, controlled, much, of, the, middle, east, as, well, as, parts, of, west, africa, and, the, iberian, peninsula, muslim, armies, consisted, mostly, of, cavalry, made, up, of, fighters, from, various, local, groups, mercenaries, and, turkoman, tribesmen, the, latter, were, considered, particularly, skilled, as, both, lancers, and, archers, from, horseback, in, the, 9th, century, the, use, of, mamluks, slaves, raised, to, be, soldiers, for, various, muslim, rulers, became, increasingly, common, mobile, tactics, advanced, breeding, of, horses, and, detailed, training, manuals, made, mamluk, cavalry, a, highly, efficient, fighting, force, the, use, of, armies, consisting, mostly, of, cavalry, continued, among, the, turkish, people, who, founded, the, ottoman, empire, their, need, for, large, mounted, forces, led, to, an, establishment, of, the, sipahi, cavalry, soldiers, who, were, granted, lands, in, exchange, for, providing, military, service, in, times, of, war, mounted, muslim, warriors, conquered, north, africa, and, the, iberian, peninsula, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, ad, following, the, hijrah, of, muhammad, in, 622, ad, by, 630, ad, their, influence, expanded, across, the, middle, east, and, into, western, north, africa, by, 711, ad, the, light, cavalry, of, muslim, warriors, had, reached, spain, and, controlled, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, by, 720, their, mounts, were, of, various, oriental, types, including, the, north, african, barb, a, few, arabian, horses, may, have, come, with, the, ummayads, who, settled, in, the, guadalquivir, valley, another, strain, of, horse, that, came, with, islamic, invaders, was, the, turkoman, horse, muslim, invaders, travelled, north, from, present, day, spain, into, france, where, they, were, defeated, by, the, frankish, ruler, charles, martel, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, 732, ad, during, the, european, middle, ages, there, were, three, primary, types, of, war, horses, the, destrier, the, courser, and, the, rouncey, which, differed, in, size, and, usage, a, generic, word, used, to, describe, medieval, war, horses, was, charger, which, appears, interchangeable, with, the, other, terms, the, medieval, war, horse, was, of, moderate, size, rarely, exceeding, 15, 2, hands, 62, inches, 157, cm, heavy, horses, were, logistically, difficult, to, maintain, and, less, adaptable, to, varied, terrains, the, destrier, of, the, early, middle, ages, was, moderately, larger, than, the, courser, or, rouncey, in, part, to, accommodate, heavier, armoured, knights, however, destriers, were, not, as, large, as, draught, horses, averaging, between, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, and, 15, hands, 60, inches, 152, cm, on, the, european, continent, the, need, to, carry, more, armour, against, mounted, enemies, such, as, the, lombards, and, frisians, led, to, the, franks, developing, heavier, bigger, horses, as, the, amount, of, armour, and, equipment, increased, in, the, later, middle, ages, the, height, of, the, horses, increased, some, late, medieval, horse, skeletons, were, of, horses, over, 1, 5, metres, 15, hands, stallions, were, often, used, as, destriers, due, to, their, natural, aggression, however, there, may, have, been, some, use, of, mares, by, european, warriors, and, mares, who, were, quieter, and, less, likely, to, call, out, and, betray, their, position, to, the, enemy, were, the, preferred, war, horse, of, the, moors, who, invaded, various, parts, of, southern, europe, from, 700, ad, through, the, 15th, century, geldings, were, used, in, war, by, the, teutonic, knights, and, known, as, monk, horses, german, m, nchpferde, or, m, nchhengste, one, advantage, was, if, captured, by, the, enemy, they, could, not, be, used, to, improve, local, bloodstock, thus, maintaining, the, knights, superiority, in, horseflesh, the, heavy, cavalry, charge, while, it, could, be, effective, was, not, a, common, occurrence, battles, were, rarely, fought, on, land, suitable, for, heavy, cavalry, while, mounted, riders, remained, effective, for, initial, attacks, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, it, was, common, for, knights, to, dismount, to, fight, while, their, horses, were, sent, to, the, rear, kept, ready, for, pursuit, pitched, battles, were, avoided, if, possible, with, most, offensive, warfare, in, the, early, middle, ages, taking, the, form, of, sieges, and, in, the, later, middle, ages, as, mounted, raids, called, chevauch, es, with, lightly, armed, warriors, on, swift, horses, the, war, horse, was, also, seen, in, hastiludes, martial, war, games, such, as, the, joust, which, began, in, the, 11th, century, both, as, sport, and, to, provide, training, for, battle, specialised, destriers, were, bred, for, the, purpose, although, the, expense, of, keeping, training, and, outfitting, them, kept, the, majority, of, the, population, from, owning, one, while, some, historians, suggest, that, the, tournament, had, become, a, theatrical, event, by, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, others, argue, that, jousting, continued, to, help, cavalry, train, for, battle, until, the, thirty, years, war, the, decline, of, the, armoured, knight, was, probably, linked, to, changing, structures, of, armies, and, various, economic, factors, and, not, obsolescence, due, to, new, technologies, however, some, historians, attribute, the, demise, of, the, knight, to, the, invention, of, gunpowder, or, to, the, english, longbow, some, link, the, decline, to, both, technologies, others, argue, these, technologies, actually, contributed, to, the, development, of, knights, plate, armour, was, first, developed, to, resist, early, medieval, crossbow, bolts, and, the, full, harness, worn, by, the, early, 15th, century, developed, to, resist, longbow, arrows, from, the, 14th, century, onwards, most, plate, was, made, from, hardened, steel, which, resisted, early, musket, ammunition, in, addition, stronger, designs, did, not, make, plate, heavier, a, full, harness, of, musket, proof, plate, from, the, 17th, century, weighed, 70, pounds, 32, kg, significantly, less, than, 16th, century, tournament, armour, the, move, to, predominately, infantry, based, battles, from, 1300, to, 1550, was, linked, to, both, improved, infantry, tactics, and, changes, in, weaponry, by, the, 16th, century, the, concept, of, a, combined, arms, professional, army, had, spread, throughout, europe, professional, armies, emphasized, training, and, were, paid, via, contracts, a, change, from, the, ransom, and, pillaging, which, reimbursed, knights, in, the, past, when, coupled, with, the, rising, costs, involved, in, outfitting, and, maintaining, armour, and, horses, the, traditional, knightly, classes, began, to, abandon, their, profession, light, horses, or, prickers, were, still, used, for, scouting, and, reconnaissance, they, also, provided, a, defensive, screen, for, marching, armies, large, teams, of, draught, horses, or, oxen, pulled, the, heavy, early, cannon, other, horses, pulled, wagons, and, carried, supplies, for, the, armies, during, the, early, modern, period, the, shift, continued, from, heavy, cavalry, and, the, armoured, knight, to, unarmoured, light, cavalry, including, hussars, and, chasseurs, cheval, light, cavalry, facilitated, better, communication, using, fast, agile, horses, to, move, quickly, across, battlefields, the, ratio, of, footmen, to, horsemen, also, increased, over, the, period, as, infantry, weapons, improved, and, footmen, became, more, mobile, and, versatile, particularly, once, the, musket, bayonet, replaced, the, more, cumbersome, pike, during, the, elizabethan, era, mounted, units, included, cuirassiers, heavily, armoured, and, equipped, with, lances, light, cavalry, who, wore, mail, and, bore, light, lances, and, pistols, and, petronels, who, carried, an, early, carbine, as, heavy, cavalry, use, declined, armour, was, increasingly, abandoned, and, dragoons, whose, horses, were, rarely, used, in, combat, became, more, common, mounted, infantry, provided, reconnaissance, escort, and, security, however, many, generals, still, used, the, heavy, mounted, charge, from, the, late, 17th, century, and, early, 18th, century, where, sword, wielding, wedge, formation, shock, troops, penetrated, enemy, lines, to, the, early, 19th, century, where, armoured, heavy, cuirassiers, were, employed, light, cavalry, continued, to, play, a, major, role, particularly, after, the, seven, years, war, when, hussars, started, to, play, a, larger, part, in, battles, though, some, leaders, preferred, tall, horses, for, their, mounted, troops, this, was, as, much, for, prestige, as, for, increased, shock, ability, and, many, troops, used, more, typical, horses, averaging, 15, hands, cavalry, tactics, altered, with, fewer, mounted, charges, more, reliance, on, drilled, maneuvers, at, the, trot, and, use, of, firearms, once, within, range, ever, more, elaborate, movements, such, as, wheeling, and, caracole, were, developed, to, facilitate, the, use, of, firearms, from, horseback, these, tactics, were, not, greatly, successful, in, battle, since, pikemen, protected, by, musketeers, could, deny, cavalry, room, to, manoeuvre, however, the, advanced, equestrianism, required, survives, into, the, modern, world, as, dressage, while, restricted, cavalry, was, not, rendered, obsolete, as, infantry, formations, developed, in, tactics, and, skills, artillery, became, essential, to, break, formations, in, turn, cavalry, was, required, to, both, combat, enemy, artillery, which, was, susceptible, to, cavalry, while, deploying, and, to, charge, enemy, infantry, formations, broken, by, artillery, fire, thus, successful, warfare, depended, in, a, balance, of, the, three, arms, cavalry, artillery, and, infantry, as, regimental, structures, developed, many, units, selected, horses, of, uniform, type, and, some, such, as, the, royal, scots, greys, even, specified, colour, trumpeters, often, rode, distinctive, horses, so, they, stood, out, regional, armies, developed, type, preferences, such, as, british, hunters, hanoverians, in, central, europe, and, steppe, ponies, of, the, cossacks, but, once, in, the, field, the, lack, of, supplies, typical, of, wartime, meant, that, horses, of, all, types, were, used, since, horses, were, such, a, vital, component, of, most, armies, in, early, modern, europe, many, instituted, state, stud, farms, to, breed, horses, for, the, military, however, in, wartime, supply, rarely, matched, the, demand, resulting, in, some, cavalry, troops, fighting, on, foot, in, the, 19th, century, distinctions, between, heavy, and, light, cavalry, became, less, significant, by, the, end, of, the, peninsular, war, heavy, cavalry, were, performing, the, scouting, and, outpost, duties, previously, undertaken, by, light, cavalry, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, roles, had, effectively, merged, most, armies, at, the, time, preferred, cavalry, horses, to, stand, 15, 2, hands, 62, inches, 157, cm, and, weigh, 990, to, 1, 100, pounds, 450, to, 500, kg, although, cuirassiers, frequently, had, heavier, horses, lighter, horses, were, used, for, scouting, and, raiding, cavalry, horses, were, generally, obtained, at, 5, years, of, age, and, were, in, service, from, 10, to, 12, years, barring, loss, however, losses, of, 30, 40, were, common, during, a, campaign, due, to, conditions, of, the, march, as, well, as, enemy, action, mares, and, geldings, were, preferred, over, less, easily, managed, stallions, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, napoleonic, wars, the, cavalry, s, main, offensive, role, was, as, shock, troops, in, defence, cavalry, were, used, to, attack, and, harass, the, enemy, s, infantry, flanks, as, they, advanced, cavalry, were, frequently, used, prior, to, an, infantry, assault, to, force, an, infantry, line, to, break, and, reform, into, formations, vulnerable, to, infantry, or, artillery, infantry, frequently, followed, behind, in, order, to, secure, any, ground, won, or, the, cavalry, could, be, used, to, break, up, enemy, lines, following, a, successful, infantry, action, mounted, charges, were, carefully, managed, a, charge, s, maximum, speed, was, 20, km, h, moving, faster, resulted, in, a, break, in, formation, and, fatigued, horses, charges, occurred, across, clear, rising, ground, and, were, effective, against, infantry, both, on, the, march, and, when, deployed, in, a, line, or, column, a, foot, battalion, formed, in, line, was, vulnerable, to, cavalry, and, could, be, broken, or, destroyed, by, a, well, formed, charge, traditional, cavalry, functions, altered, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, many, cavalry, units, transferred, in, title, and, role, to, mounted, rifles, troops, trained, to, fight, on, foot, but, retaining, mounts, for, rapid, deployment, as, well, as, for, patrols, scouting, communications, and, defensive, screening, these, troops, differed, from, mounted, infantry, who, used, horses, for, transport, but, did, not, perform, the, old, cavalry, roles, of, reconnaissance, and, support, horses, were, used, for, warfare, in, the, central, sudan, since, the, 9th, century, where, they, were, considered, the, most, precious, commodity, following, the, slave, the, first, conclusive, evidence, of, horses, playing, a, major, role, in, the, warfare, of, west, africa, dates, to, the, 11th, century, when, the, region, was, controlled, by, the, almoravids, a, muslim, berber, dynasty, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, cavalry, became, an, important, factor, in, the, area, this, coincided, with, the, introduction, of, larger, breeds, of, horse, and, the, widespread, adoption, of, saddles, and, stirrups, increased, mobility, played, a, part, in, the, formation, of, new, power, centers, such, as, the, oyo, empire, in, what, today, is, nigeria, the, authority, of, many, african, islamic, states, such, as, the, bornu, empire, also, rested, in, large, part, on, their, ability, to, subject, neighboring, peoples, with, cavalry, despite, harsh, climate, conditions, endemic, diseases, such, as, trypanosomiasis, the, african, horse, sickness, and, unsuitable, terrain, that, limited, the, effectiveness, of, horses, in, many, parts, of, africa, horses, were, continuously, imported, and, were, in, some, areas, a, vital, instrument, of, war, the, introduction, of, horses, also, intensified, existing, conflicts, such, as, those, between, the, herero, and, nama, people, in, namibia, during, the, 19th, century, the, african, slave, trade, was, closely, tied, to, the, imports, of, war, horses, and, as, the, prevalence, of, slaving, decreased, fewer, horses, were, needed, for, raiding, this, significantly, decreased, the, amount, of, mounted, warfare, seen, in, west, africa, by, the, time, of, the, scramble, for, africa, and, the, introduction, of, modern, firearms, in, the, 1880s, the, use, of, horses, in, african, warfare, had, lost, most, of, its, effectiveness, nonetheless, in, south, africa, during, the, second, boer, war, 1899, 1902, cavalry, and, other, mounted, troops, were, the, major, combat, force, for, the, british, since, the, horse, mounted, boers, moved, too, quickly, for, infantry, to, engage, the, boers, presented, a, mobile, and, innovative, approach, to, warfare, drawing, on, strategies, that, had, first, appeared, in, the, american, civil, war, the, terrain, was, not, well, suited, to, the, british, horses, resulting, in, the, loss, of, over, 300, 000, animals, as, the, campaign, wore, on, losses, were, replaced, by, more, durable, african, basuto, ponies, and, waler, horses, from, australia, the, horse, had, been, extinct, in, the, western, hemisphere, for, approximately, 10, 000, years, prior, to, the, arrival, of, spanish, conquistadors, in, the, early, 16th, century, consequently, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, had, no, warfare, technologies, that, could, overcome, the, considerable, advantage, provided, by, european, horses, and, gunpowder, weapons, in, particular, this, resulted, in, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, and, inca, empires, the, speed, and, increased, impact, of, cavalry, contributed, to, a, number, of, early, victories, by, european, fighters, in, open, terrain, though, their, success, was, limited, in, more, mountainous, regions, the, incas, well, maintained, roads, in, the, andes, enabled, quick, mounted, raids, such, as, those, undertaken, by, the, spanish, while, resisting, the, siege, of, cuzco, in, 1536, 37, indigenous, populations, of, south, america, soon, learned, to, use, horses, in, chile, the, mapuche, began, using, cavalry, in, the, arauco, war, in, 1586, they, drove, the, spanish, out, of, araucan, a, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, later, the, mapuche, conducted, mounted, raids, known, as, mal, nes, first, on, spanish, then, on, chilean, and, argentine, settlements, until, well, into, the, 19th, century, in, north, america, native, americans, also, quickly, learned, to, use, horses, in, particular, the, people, of, the, great, plains, such, as, the, comanche, and, the, cheyenne, became, renowned, horseback, fighters, by, the, 19th, century, they, presented, a, formidable, force, against, the, united, states, army, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1775, 1783, the, continental, army, made, relatively, little, use, of, cavalry, primarily, relying, on, infantry, and, a, few, dragoon, regiments, the, united, states, congress, eventually, authorized, regiments, specifically, designated, as, cavalry, in, 1855, the, newly, formed, american, cavalry, adopted, tactics, based, on, experiences, fighting, over, vast, distances, during, the, mexican, war, 1846, 1848, and, against, indigenous, peoples, on, the, western, frontier, abandoning, some, european, traditions, during, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, cavalry, held, the, most, important, and, respected, role, it, would, ever, hold, in, the, american, military, field, artillery, in, the, american, civil, war, was, also, highly, mobile, both, horses, and, mules, pulled, the, guns, though, only, horses, were, used, on, the, battlefield, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, most, of, the, experienced, cavalry, officers, were, from, the, south, and, thus, joined, the, confederacy, leading, to, the, confederate, army, s, initial, battlefield, superiority, the, tide, turned, at, the, 1863, battle, of, brandy, station, part, of, the, gettysburg, campaign, where, the, union, cavalry, in, the, largest, cavalry, battle, ever, fought, on, the, american, continent, ended, the, dominance, of, the, south, by, 1865, union, cavalry, were, decisive, in, achieving, victory, so, important, were, horses, to, individual, soldiers, that, the, surrender, terms, at, appomattox, allowed, every, confederate, cavalryman, to, take, his, horse, home, with, him, this, was, because, unlike, their, union, counterparts, confederate, cavalrymen, provided, their, own, horses, for, service, instead, of, drawing, them, from, the, government, although, cavalry, was, used, extensively, throughout, the, world, during, the, 19th, century, horses, became, less, important, in, warfare, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, light, cavalry, was, still, seen, on, the, battlefield, but, formal, mounted, cavalry, began, to, be, phased, out, for, combat, during, and, immediately, after, world, war, i, although, units, that, included, horses, still, had, military, uses, well, into, world, war, ii, world, war, i, saw, great, changes, in, the, use, of, cavalry, the, mode, of, warfare, changed, and, the, use, of, trench, warfare, barbed, wire, and, machine, guns, rendered, traditional, cavalry, almost, obsolete, tanks, introduced, in, 1917, began, to, take, over, the, role, of, shock, combat, early, in, the, war, cavalry, skirmishes, were, common, and, horse, mounted, troops, widely, used, for, reconnaissance, on, the, western, front, cavalry, were, an, effective, flanking, force, during, the, race, to, the, sea, in, 1914, but, were, less, useful, once, trench, warfare, was, established, there, a, few, examples, of, successful, shock, combat, and, cavalry, divisions, also, provided, important, mobile, firepower, cavalry, played, a, greater, role, on, the, eastern, front, where, trench, warfare, was, less, common, on, the, eastern, front, and, also, against, the, ottomans, the, cavalry, was, literally, indispensable, british, empire, cavalry, proved, adaptable, since, they, were, trained, to, fight, both, on, foot, and, while, mounted, while, other, european, cavalry, relied, primarily, on, shock, action, on, both, fronts, the, horse, was, also, used, as, a, pack, animal, because, railway, lines, could, not, withstand, artillery, bombardments, horses, carried, ammunition, and, supplies, between, the, railheads, and, the, rear, trenches, though, the, horses, generally, were, not, used, in, the, actual, trench, zone, this, role, of, horses, was, critical, and, thus, horse, fodder, was, the, single, largest, commodity, shipped, to, the, front, by, some, countries, following, the, war, many, cavalry, regiments, were, converted, to, mechanised, armoured, divisions, with, light, tanks, developed, to, perform, many, of, the, cavalry, s, original, roles, several, nations, used, horse, units, during, world, war, ii, the, polish, army, used, mounted, infantry, to, defend, against, the, armies, of, nazi, germany, during, the, 1939, invasion, both, the, germans, and, the, soviet, union, maintained, cavalry, units, throughout,
