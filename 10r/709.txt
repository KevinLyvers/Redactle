a, hot, air, balloon, is, a, lighter, than, air, aircraft, consisting, of, a, bag, called, an, envelope, which, contains, heated, air, suspended, beneath, is, a, gondola, or, wicker, basket, in, some, long, distance, or, high, altitude, balloons, a, capsule, which, carries, passengers, and, a, source, of, heat, in, most, cases, an, open, flame, caused, by, burning, liquid, propane, the, heated, air, inside, the, envelope, makes, it, buoyant, since, it, has, a, lower, density, than, the, colder, air, outside, the, envelope, as, with, all, aircraft, hot, air, balloons, cannot, fly, beyond, the, atmosphere, the, envelope, does, not, have, to, be, sealed, at, the, bottom, since, the, air, inside, the, envelope, is, at, about, the, same, pressure, as, the, surrounding, air, in, modern, sport, balloons, the, envelope, is, generally, made, from, nylon, fabric, and, the, inlet, of, the, balloon, closest, to, the, burner, flame, is, made, from, a, fire, resistant, material, such, as, nomex, modern, balloons, have, been, made, in, many, shapes, such, as, rocket, ships, and, the, shapes, of, various, commercial, products, though, the, traditional, shape, is, used, for, most, non, commercial, and, many, commercial, applications, the, hot, air, balloon, is, the, first, successful, human, carrying, flight, technology, the, first, untethered, manned, hot, air, balloon, flight, in, the, world, was, performed, in, paris, france, by, jean, fran, ois, pil, tre, de, rozier, and, fran, ois, laurent, d, arlandes, on, november, 21, 1783, in, a, balloon, created, by, the, montgolfier, brothers, the, first, hot, air, balloon, flown, in, the, americas, was, launched, from, the, walnut, street, jail, in, philadelphia, on, january, 9, 1793, by, the, french, aeronaut, jean, pierre, blanchard, hot, air, balloons, that, can, be, propelled, through, the, air, rather, than, simply, drifting, with, the, wind, are, known, as, thermal, airships, a, precursor, of, the, hot, air, balloon, was, the, sky, lantern, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, zhuge, liang, of, the, shu, han, kingdom, during, the, three, kingdoms, era, 220, 280, ce, used, these, airborne, lanterns, for, military, signaling, the, mongolian, army, studied, kongming, lanterns, from, china, and, used, them, in, the, battle, of, legnica, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, poland, in, the, 13th, century, this, is, the, first, time, ballooning, was, known, in, the, western, world, in, the, 18th, century, the, colonial, brazilian, jesuit, priest, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, envisioned, an, aerial, apparatus, named, passarola, which, was, the, predecessor, of, the, hot, air, balloon, the, passarola, was, intended, to, serve, as, air, vessel, in, order, to, facilitate, communication, and, as, a, strategical, device, in, 1709, john, v, of, portugal, decided, to, fund, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, s, project, following, a, petition, made, by, the, jesuit, priest, and, an, unmanned, demonstration, was, performed, at, casa, da, ndia, in, the, presence, of, john, v, and, the, queen, maria, anna, of, austria, with, the, italian, cardinal, michelangelo, conti, two, members, of, the, portuguese, royal, academy, of, history, one, portuguese, diplomat, and, one, chronicler, serving, as, witnesses, this, event, would, bring, some, european, attention, to, this, event, and, this, project, a, later, article, dated, on, october, 20, 1786, by, the, london, daily, universal, register, would, state, that, the, inventor, was, able, to, raise, himself, by, the, use, of, his, prototype, also, in, 1709, the, portuguese, jesuit, wrote, manifesto, summ, rio, para, os, que, ignoram, poderse, navegar, pelo, elemento, do, ar, short, manifesto, for, those, who, are, unaware, that, is, possible, to, sail, through, the, element, air, he, also, left, designs, for, a, manned, air, vessel, in, the, 1970s, balloonist, julian, nott, hypothesized, that, the, nazca, lines, geoglyphs, creation, two, millennia, ago, could, have, been, guided, by, nazca, leaders, in, a, balloon, possibly, the, earliest, hot, air, balloon, flights, in, human, history, to, support, this, theory, in, 1975, he, designed, and, piloted, the, nazca, prehistoric, balloon, claiming, to, have, used, only, methods, and, materials, available, to, the, pre, inca, peruvians, 1, 000, years, ago, the, french, brothers, joseph, michel, and, jacques, tienne, montgolfier, developed, a, hot, air, balloon, in, annonay, ard, che, france, and, demonstrated, it, publicly, on, september, 19, 1783, making, an, unmanned, flight, lasting, 10, minutes, after, experimenting, with, unmanned, balloons, and, flights, with, animals, the, first, balloon, flight, with, humans, aboard, a, tethered, flight, performed, on, or, around, october, 15, 1783, by, jean, francois, pilatre, de, rozier, who, made, at, least, one, tethered, flight, from, the, yard, of, the, reveillon, workshop, in, the, faubourg, saint, antoine, later, that, same, day, pilatre, de, rozier, became, the, second, human, to, ascend, into, the, air, reaching, an, altitude, of, 26, m, 85, ft, the, length, of, the, tether, the, first, free, flight, with, human, passengers, was, made, a, few, weeks, later, on, november, 21, 1783, king, louis, xvi, had, originally, decreed, that, condemned, criminals, would, be, the, first, pilots, but, de, rozier, along, with, marquis, fran, ois, d, arlandes, petitioned, successfully, for, the, honor, the, first, military, use, of, a, hot, air, balloon, happened, in, 1794, during, the, battle, of, fleurus, when, the, french, used, the, balloon, l, entreprenant, for, observation, jean, pierre, blanchard, became, the, first, person, to, fly, a, hot, air, balloon, in, various, countries, including, the, united, states, the, netherlands, and, germany, his, most, notable, flight, crossed, the, english, channel, heading, to, the, dover, castle, accompanied, by, john, jeffries, which, occurred, on, 7, january, 1785, in, 1808, blanchard, suffered, a, heart, attack, while, ballooning, above, the, hague, fell, from, his, balloon, and, experienced, fatal, injuries, his, wife, sophie, blanchard, continued, his, profession, but, also, died, a, decade, later, on, a, balloon, due, to, a, firework, festival, causing, the, hydrogen, in, the, balloon, to, be, set, on, fire, modern, hot, air, balloons, with, an, onboard, heat, source, were, developed, by, ed, yost, and, jim, winker, beginning, during, the, 1950s, their, work, resulted, in, his, a, first, successful, flight, on, october, 22, 1960, the, first, modern, hot, air, balloon, to, be, made, in, the, united, kingdom, uk, was, the, bristol, belle, built, in, 1967, presently, hot, air, balloons, are, used, primarily, for, recreation, hot, air, balloons, are, able, to, fly, to, extremely, high, altitudes, on, november, 26, 2005, vijaypat, singhania, set, the, world, altitude, record, for, highest, hot, air, balloon, flight, reaching, 21, 027, m, 68, 986, ft, he, took, off, from, downtown, mumbai, india, and, landed, 240, km, 150, mi, south, in, panchale, the, previous, record, of, 19, 811, m, 64, 997, ft, had, been, set, by, per, lindstrand, on, june, 6, 1988, in, plano, texas, on, january, 15, 1991, the, virgin, pacific, flyer, balloon, completed, the, longest, flight, in, a, hot, air, balloon, when, per, lindstrand, born, in, sweden, but, resident, in, the, uk, and, richard, branson, of, the, uk, flew, 7, 671, 91, km, 4, 767, 10, mi, from, japan, to, northern, canada, with, a, volume, of, 74, 000, cubic, meters, 2, 6, million, cubic, feet, the, balloon, envelope, was, the, largest, ever, built, for, a, hot, air, craft, designed, to, fly, in, the, trans, oceanic, jet, streams, the, pacific, flyer, recorded, the, fastest, ground, speed, for, a, manned, balloon, at, 394, km, h, 245, mph, the, longest, duration, record, was, set, by, swiss, psychiatrist, bertrand, piccard, auguste, piccard, s, grandson, and, briton, brian, jones, flying, in, the, breitling, orbiter, 3, it, was, the, first, nonstop, trip, around, the, world, by, balloon, the, balloon, left, ch, teau, d, oex, switzerland, on, march, 1, 1999, and, landed, at, 1, 02, a, m, on, march, 21, in, the, egyptian, desert, 500, km, 300, mi, south, of, cairo, the, two, men, exceeded, distance, endurance, and, time, records, traveling, 19, days, 21, hours, and, 55, minutes, steve, fossett, flying, solo, exceeded, the, record, for, briefest, time, traveling, around, the, world, on, 3, july, 2002, on, his, sixth, attempt, in, 320, h, 33, min, fedor, konyukhov, flew, solo, round, the, world, on, his, first, attempt, in, a, hybrid, hot, air, helium, balloon, from, 11, to, 23, july, 2016, for, a, round, the, world, time, of, 268, h, 20, min, a, hot, air, balloon, for, manned, flight, uses, a, single, layered, fabric, gas, bag, lifting, envelope, with, an, opening, at, the, bottom, called, the, mouth, or, throat, attached, to, the, envelope, is, a, basket, or, gondola, for, carrying, the, passengers, mounted, above, the, basket, and, centered, in, the, mouth, is, the, burner, which, injects, a, flame, into, the, envelope, heating, the, air, within, the, heater, or, burner, is, fueled, by, propane, a, liquefied, gas, stored, in, pressure, vessels, similar, to, high, pressure, forklift, cylinders, modern, hot, air, balloons, are, usually, made, of, materials, such, as, ripstop, nylon, or, dacron, a, polyester, during, the, manufacturing, process, the, material, is, cut, into, panels, and, sewn, together, along, with, structural, load, tapes, that, carry, the, weight, of, the, gondola, or, basket, the, individual, sections, which, extend, from, the, throat, to, the, crown, top, of, the, envelope, are, known, as, gores, or, gore, sections, envelopes, can, have, as, few, as, 4, gores, or, as, many, as, 24, or, more, envelopes, often, have, a, crown, ring, at, their, very, top, this, is, a, hoop, of, smooth, metal, usually, aluminium, and, approximately, 30, cm, 1, ft, in, diameter, vertical, load, tapes, from, the, envelope, are, attached, to, the, crown, ring, at, the, bottom, of, the, envelope, the, vertical, load, tapes, are, sewn, into, loops, that, are, connected, to, cables, one, cable, per, load, tape, these, cables, often, referred, to, as, flying, wires, are, connected, to, the, basket, by, carabiners, the, most, common, technique, for, sewing, panels, together, is, called, the, french, felled, french, fell, or, double, lap, seam, the, two, pieces, of, fabric, are, folded, over, on, each, other, at, their, common, edge, possibly, with, a, load, tape, as, well, and, sewn, together, with, two, rows, of, parallel, stitching, other, methods, include, a, flat, lap, seam, in, which, the, two, pieces, of, fabric, are, held, together, simply, with, two, rows, of, parallel, stitching, and, a, zigzag, where, parallel, zigzag, stitching, holds, a, double, lap, of, fabric, the, fabric, or, at, least, part, of, it, the, top, 1, 3, for, example, may, be, coated, with, a, sealer, such, as, silicone, or, polyurethane, to, make, it, impermeable, to, air, it, is, often, the, degradation, of, this, coating, and, the, corresponding, loss, of, impermeability, that, ends, the, effective, life, of, an, envelope, not, weakening, of, the, fabric, itself, heat, moisture, and, mechanical, wear, and, tear, during, set, up, and, pack, up, are, the, primary, causes, of, degradation, once, an, envelope, becomes, too, porous, to, fly, it, may, be, retired, and, discarded, or, perhaps, used, as, a, rag, bag, cold, inflated, and, opened, for, children, to, run, through, products, for, recoating, the, fabric, are, becoming, available, commercially, a, range, of, envelope, sizes, is, available, the, smallest, one, person, basket, less, balloons, called, hoppers, or, cloudhoppers, have, as, little, as, 600, m, 3, 21, 000, cu, ft, of, envelope, volume, for, a, perfect, sphere, the, radius, would, be, around, 5, m, 16, ft, at, the, other, end, of, the, scale, balloons, used, by, commercial, sightseeing, operations, may, be, able, to, carry, well, over, two, dozen, people, with, envelope, volumes, of, up, to, 17, 000, m, 3, 600, 000, cu, ft, the, most, used, size, is, about, 2, 800, m, 3, 99, 000, cu, ft, allowing, to, carry, 3, to, 5, people, the, top, of, the, balloon, usually, has, a, vent, of, some, sort, enabling, the, pilot, to, release, hot, air, to, slow, an, ascent, start, a, descent, or, increase, the, rate, of, descent, usually, for, landing, some, hot, air, balloons, have, turning, vents, which, are, side, vents, that, when, opened, cause, the, balloon, to, rotate, such, vents, are, particularly, useful, for, balloons, with, rectangular, baskets, to, facilitate, aligning, the, wider, side, of, the, basket, for, landing, the, most, common, type, of, top, vent, is, a, disk, shaped, flap, of, fabric, called, a, parachute, vent, invented, by, tracy, barnes, the, fabric, is, connected, around, its, edge, to, a, set, of, vent, lines, that, converge, in, the, center, the, arrangement, of, fabric, and, lines, roughly, resembles, a, parachute, thus, the, name, these, vent, lines, are, themselves, connected, to, a, control, line, that, runs, to, the, basket, a, parachute, vent, is, opened, by, pulling, on, the, control, line, once, the, control, line, is, released, the, pressure, of, the, remaining, hot, air, pushes, the, vent, fabric, back, into, place, a, parachute, vent, can, be, opened, briefly, while, in, flight, to, initiate, a, rapid, descent, slower, descents, are, initiated, by, allowing, the, air, in, the, balloon, to, cool, naturally, the, vent, is, pulled, open, completely, to, collapse, the, balloon, after, landing, an, older, and, presently, less, commonly, used, style, of, top, vent, is, called, a, velcro, style, vent, this, too, is, a, disk, of, fabric, at, the, top, of, the, balloon, however, rather, than, having, a, set, of, vent, lines, that, can, repeatedly, open, and, close, the, vent, the, vent, is, secured, by, hook, and, loop, fasteners, such, as, velcro, and, is, only, opened, at, the, end, of, the, flight, balloons, equipped, with, a, velcro, style, vent, typically, have, a, second, maneuvering, vent, built, into, the, side, as, opposed, to, the, top, of, the, balloon, another, common, type, of, top, design, is, the, smart, vent, which, rather, than, lowering, a, fabric, disc, into, the, envelope, as, in, the, parachute, type, gathers, the, fabric, together, in, the, center, of, the, opening, this, system, can, theoretically, be, used, for, in, flight, maneuvering, but, is, more, commonly, used, only, as, a, rapid, deflation, device, for, use, after, landing, of, particular, value, in, high, winds, other, designs, such, as, the, pop, top, and, multivent, systems, have, also, attempted, to, address, the, need, for, rapid, deflation, on, landing, but, the, parachute, top, remains, popular, as, an, all, around, maneuvering, and, deflation, system, besides, special, shapes, possibly, for, marketing, purposes, there, are, several, variations, on, the, traditional, inverted, tear, drop, shape, the, simplest, often, used, by, home, builders, is, a, hemisphere, on, top, of, a, truncated, cone, more, sophisticated, designs, attempt, to, minimize, the, circumferential, stress, on, the, fabric, with, different, degrees, of, success, depending, on, whether, they, take, fabric, weight, and, varying, air, density, into, account, this, shape, may, be, referred, to, as, natural, finally, some, specialized, balloons, are, designed, to, minimize, aerodynamic, drag, in, the, vertical, direction, to, improve, flight, performance, in, competitions, hot, air, balloon, baskets, are, commonly, made, of, woven, wicker, or, rattan, these, materials, have, proven, to, be, sufficiently, light, strong, and, durable, for, balloon, flight, such, baskets, are, usually, rectangular, or, triangular, in, shape, they, vary, in, size, from, just, big, enough, for, two, people, to, large, enough, to, carry, thirty, larger, baskets, often, have, internal, partitions, for, structural, bracing, and, to, compartmentalize, the, passengers, small, holes, may, be, woven, into, the, side, of, the, basket, to, act, as, foot, holds, for, passengers, climbing, in, or, out, baskets, may, also, be, made, of, aluminium, especially, a, collapsible, aluminium, frame, with, a, fabric, skin, to, reduce, weight, or, increase, portability, these, may, be, used, by, pilots, without, a, ground, crew, or, who, are, attempting, to, set, altitude, duration, or, distance, records, other, specialty, baskets, include, the, fully, enclosed, gondolas, used, for, around, the, world, attempts, and, baskets, that, consist, of, little, more, than, a, seat, for, the, pilot, and, perhaps, one, passenger, the, burner, unit, gasifies, liquid, propane, mixes, it, with, air, ignites, the, mixture, and, directs, the, flame, and, exhaust, into, the, mouth, of, the, envelope, burners, vary, in, power, output, each, will, generally, produce, 2, to, 3, mw, of, heat, 7, to, 10, million, btus, per, hour, with, double, triple, or, quadruple, burner, configurations, installed, where, more, power, is, needed, the, pilot, actuates, a, burner, by, opening, a, propane, valve, known, as, a, blast, valve, the, valve, may, be, spring, loaded, so, that, it, closes, automatically, or, it, may, stay, open, until, closed, by, the, pilot, the, burner, has, a, pilot, light, to, ignite, the, propane, and, air, mixture, the, pilot, light, may, be, lit, by, the, pilot, with, an, external, device, such, as, a, flint, striker, or, a, lighter, or, with, a, built, in, piezoelectric, spark, where, more, than, one, burner, is, present, the, pilot, can, use, one, or, more, at, a, time, depending, on, the, desired, heat, output, each, burner, has, a, metal, coil, of, propane, tubing, the, flame, shoots, through, to, preheat, the, incoming, liquid, propane, the, burner, unit, may, be, suspended, from, the, mouth, of, the, envelope, or, supported, rigidly, over, the, basket, the, burner, unit, may, be, mounted, on, a, gimbal, to, enable, the, pilot, to, aim, the, flame, and, avoid, overheating, the, envelope, fabric, a, burner, may, have, a, secondary, propane, valve, that, releases, propane, more, slowly, and, thereby, generates, a, different, sound, this, is, called, a, whisper, burner, and, is, used, for, flight, over, livestock, to, lessen, the, chance, of, spooking, them, it, also, generates, a, more, yellow, flame, and, is, used, for, night, glows, because, it, lights, up, the, inside, of, the, envelope, better, than, the, primary, valve, propane, fuel, tanks, are, usually, cylindrical, pressure, vessels, made, from, aluminium, stainless, steel, or, titanium, with, a, valve, at, one, end, to, feed, the, burner, and, to, refuel, they, may, have, a, fuel, gauge, and, a, pressure, gauge, common, tank, sizes, are, 38, 57, and, 76, litres, 10, 15, and, 20, us, gallons, they, may, be, intended, for, upright, or, horizontal, use, and, may, be, mounted, inside, or, outside, the, basket, the, pressure, necessary, to, force, the, fuel, through, the, line, to, the, burner, may, be, supplied, by, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, propane, itself, if, warm, enough, or, by, the, introduction, of, an, inert, gas, such, as, nitrogen, tanks, may, be, preheated, with, electrical, heat, tapes, to, produce, sufficient, vapor, pressure, for, cold, weather, flying, warmed, tanks, are, usually, also, wrapped, in, an, insulating, blanket, to, preserve, heat, during, the, setup, and, flight, a, balloon, may, be, outfitted, with, a, variety, of, instruments, to, aid, the, pilot, these, commonly, include, an, altimeter, a, rate, of, climb, vertical, speed, indicator, known, as, a, variometer, envelope, air, temperature, and, ambient, air, temperature, a, gps, receiver, can, be, useful, to, indicate, ground, speed, traditional, aircraft, air, speed, indicators, would, be, useless, and, direction, the, combined, mass, of, an, average, system, can, be, calculated, as, follows, increasing, the, air, temperature, inside, the, envelope, makes, it, less, dense, than, the, surrounding, ambient, air, the, balloon, floats, because, of, the, buoyant, force, exerted, on, it, this, force, is, the, same, force, that, acts, on, objects, when, they, are, in, water, and, is, described, by, archimedes, principle, the, amount, of, lift, or, buoyancy, provided, by, a, hot, air, balloon, depends, primarily, upon, the, difference, between, the, temperature, of, the, air, inside, the, envelope, and, the, temperature, of, the, air, outside, the, envelope, for, most, envelopes, made, of, nylon, fabric, the, maximal, internal, temperature, is, limited, to, approximately, 120, c, 250, f, the, melting, point, of, nylon, is, significantly, greater, than, this, maximal, operating, temperature, about, 230, c, 450, f, but, higher, temperatures, cause, the, strength, of, the, nylon, fabric, to, degrade, more, quickly, over, time, with, a, maximal, operating, temperature, of, 120, c, 250, f, balloon, envelopes, can, generally, be, flown, for, between, 400, and, 500, hours, before, the, fabric, needs, to, be, replaced, many, balloon, pilots, operate, their, envelopes, at, temperatures, significantly, less, than, the, maximum, to, extend, envelope, fabric, life, the, lift, generated, by, 2, 800, m, 3, 100, 000, cu, ft, of, dry, air, heated, to, various, temperatures, may, be, calculated, as, follows, the, density, of, air, at, 20, c, 68, f, is, about, 1, 2, kg, m, 3, 0, 075, lb, cu, ft, the, total, lift, for, a, balloon, of, 2, 800, m, 3, 100, 000, cu, ft, heated, to, 99, c, 210, f, would, be, 723, 5, kg, 1, 595, lb, this, is, just, enough, to, generate, neutral, buoyancy, for, the, total, system, mass, not, including, the, heated, air, trapped, in, the, envelope, of, course, stated, in, the, previous, section, liftoff, would, require, a, slightly, greater, temperature, depending, on, the, desired, rate, of, climb, in, reality, the, air, contained, in, the, envelope, is, not, all, at, the, same, temperature, as, the, accompanying, thermal, image, shows, and, so, these, calculations, are, based, on, averages, for, typical, atmospheric, conditions, 20, c, or, 68, f, a, hot, air, balloon, heated, to, 99, c, 210, f, requires, about, 3, 91, m, 3, of, envelope, volume, to, lift, 1, kilogram, equivalently, 62, 5, cu, ft, lb, the, precise, amount, of, lift, provided, depends, not, only, upon, the, internal, temperature, mentioned, above, but, the, external, temperature, altitude, above, sea, level, and, humidity, of, the, air, surrounding, on, a, warm, day, a, balloon, cannot, lift, as, much, as, on, a, cool, day, because, the, temperature, required, for, launch, will, exceed, the, maximum, sustainable, for, nylon, envelope, fabric, also, in, the, lower, atmosphere, the, lift, provided, by, a, hot, air, balloon, decreases, about, 3, per, 1, 000, m, 1, per, 1, 000, ft, of, altitude, gained, there, are, several, different, types, of, hot, air, balloons, all, with, different, means, of, taking, and, sustaining, flight, standard, hot, air, balloons, are, known, as, montgolfier, balloons, and, rely, solely, on, the, buoyancy, of, hot, air, provided, by, the, burner, and, contained, by, the, envelope, this, style, of, balloon, was, developed, by, the, montgolfier, brothers, and, had, its, first, public, demonstration, on, 4, june, 1783, with, an, unmanned, flight, lasting, 10, minutes, followed, later, that, year, with, manned, flights, instead, of, using, regular, air, it, is, also, possible, to, use, lighter, than, air, gasses, such, as, helium, or, hydrogen, to, lift, the, balloon, though, this, means, it, is, technically, not, a, hot, air, balloon, though, they, did, influence, the, design, of, hybrid, balloons, the, 1785, rozi, re, balloon, is, the, main, type, of, hybrid, balloon, named, after, its, creator, jean, fran, ois, pil, tre, de, rozier, it, has, a, separate, cell, for, a, lighter, than, air, gas, typically, helium, as, well, as, a, cone, below, for, hot, air, as, is, used, in, a, hot, air, balloon, to, heat, the, helium, at, night, hydrogen, gas, was, used, in, the, very, early, stages, of, development, but, was, quickly, abandoned, due, to, the, danger, of, introducing, an, open, flame, near, the, gas, for, example, when, rozier, attempted, to, cross, the, english, channel, with, his, prototype, the, fire, used, to, heat, the, air, ignited, the, hydrogen, and, killed, both, him, and, his, copilot, thirty, minutes, after, takeoff, as, such, all, modern, hybrid, balloons, now, use, helium, as, a, lifting, gas, these, balloons, are, commonly, used, for, high, performance, records, for, hot, air, balloons, solar, balloons, are, hot, air, balloons, that, use, just, solar, energy, captured, by, an, envelope, these, envelopes, are, more, specialized, than, for, other, hot, air, balloons, trying, to, maximize, the, amount, of, solar, energy, they, collect, this, can, be, accomplished, by, rotating, the, envelope, during, flight, or, by, having, the, envelope, colored, black, or, another, dark, color, they, were, pioneered, in, the, 1970s, in, europe, by, tracy, barnes, dominic, michaelis, and, in, the, usa, by, frederick, espoo, and, paul, woessher, a, thermal, airship, or, blimp, became, a, reality, in, the, 1960s, thermal, airships, were, the, first, steerable, air, buoyant, vehicles, they, utilized, tail, fins, and, a, rudder, and, contained, strictly, hot, air, rather, than, a, mix, with, hydrogen, or, helium, observation, balloons, were, deployed, as, early, as, the, american, civil, war, and, used, as, reconnaissance, towers, the, first, military, funded, balloon, in, america, was, designed, by, thaddeus, lowe, on, august, 2, 1861, for, the, union, his, design, utilized, gas, from, municipal, lines, to, inflate, the, balloon, as, he, did, not, have, access, to, a, portable, generator, observation, balloons, during, this, time, were, all, made, using, multicolored, silk, wicker, baskets, and, were, vertically, oriented, and, tear, shaped, hydrogen, or, illumination, gas, became, the, most, used, inflation, fuel, by, the, 20th, century, as, it, was, lighter, than, air, observation, balloon, usage, skyrocketed, in, britain, by, the, royal, engineers, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, deploying, to, sudan, in, 1885, and, to, south, africa, during, the, second, boer, war, from, 1899, to, 1902, due, to, the, overall, design, of, hot, air, balloons, controlled, and, precise, steering, of, hot, air, balloons, is, not, possible, it, is, possible, for, pilots, to, try, to, achieve, basic, directional, control, by, changing, altitude, and, catching, different, wind, streams, wind, in, the, northern, hemisphere, tends, to, turn, east, due, to, coriolis, effect, as, the, altitude, increases, the, most, effective, way, of, landing, a, hot, air, balloon, is, to, reduce, the, energy, in, the, envelope, either, by, turning, down, the, flame, in, montgolfier, and, hybrid, balloons, or, more, directly, by, opening, a, flap, in, the, envelope, that, will, release, the, air, gas, inside, to, help, ensure, the, safety, of, pilot, and, passengers, a, hot, air, balloon, may, carry, several, pieces, of, safety, equipment, to, relight, the, burner, if, the, pilot, light, goes, out, and, the, optional, piezo, ignition, fails, the, pilot, should, have, ready, access, to, a, means, of, backup, ignition, such, as, a, flint, spark, lighter, many, systems, especially, those, that, carry, passengers, have, completely, duplicate, fuel, and, burner, systems, two, fuel, tanks, connected, to, two, separate, hoses, which, feed, two, distinct, burners, this, enables, a, safe, landing, in, the, case, of, a, blockage, somewhere, in, one, system, or, if, a, system, must, be, disabled, because, of, a, fuel, leak, a, fire, extinguisher, suitable, for, extinguishing, propane, fires, is, useful, most, balloons, carry, a, 1, or, 2, kg, ab, e, type, fire, extinguisher, a, handling, or, drop, line, is, mandatory, safety, equipment, in, many, countries, this, is, a, rope, or, webbing, of, 20, 30, meters, in, length, attached, to, the, balloon, basket, with, a, quick, release, connection, at, one, end, in, very, calm, winds, the, balloon, pilot, can, throw, the, handling, line, from, the, balloon, so, that, the, ground, crew, can, guide, the, balloon, safely, away, from, obstructions, on, the, ground, for, commercial, passenger, balloons, a, pilot, restraint, harness, is, mandatory, in, some, countries, this, consists, of, a, hip, belt, and, a, webbing, line, that, together, allow, for, some, movement, while, preventing, the, pilot, from, being, ejected, from, the, basket, during, a, hard, landing, further, safety, equipment, may, include, a, first, aid, kit, a, fire, blanket, and, a, strong, rescue, knife, at, a, minimum, the, pilot, should, wear, leather, or, flame, retardant, fiber, such, as, nomex, gloves, so, that, they, may, shut, off, a, gas, valve, in, the, case, of, a, leak, even, if, there, is, a, flame, present, quick, action, in, this, regard, can, turn, a, potential, catastrophe, into, a, mere, inconvenience, the, pilot, should, additionally, wear, flame, resistant, clothing, covering, their, arms, and, legs, either, natural, fiber, such, as, cotton, linen, hemp, or, wool, or, engineered, flame, retardant, fiber, such, as, nomex, is, acceptable, in, this, capacity, most, engineered, fibers, with, the, exception, of, rayon, which, is, also, safe, to, wear, are, thermoplastic, many, are, also, hydrocarbons, this, makes, such, fabrics, very, much, unsuitable, to, wear, near, high, temperatures, since, non, flame, retardant, thermoplastics, will, melt, onto, the, wearer, and, most, hydrocarbons, whether, fibrous, or, not, are, suitable, to, use, as, fuels, natural, fiber, will, singe, rather, than, melt, or, burn, readily, and, flame, retardant, fiber, generally, has, a, very, high, melting, point, and, is, intrinsically, non, flammable, many, pilots, also, advise, their, passengers, to, wear, similar, protective, clothing, that, covers, their, arms, and, legs, as, well, as, strong, shoes, or, boots, that, offer, good, ankle, support, finally, some, balloon, systems, especially, those, that, hang, the, burner, from, the, envelope, instead, of, supporting, it, rigidly, from, the, basket, require, the, use, of, helmets, by, the, pilot, and, passengers, the, ground, crew, should, wear, gloves, whenever, there, is, a, possibility, of, handling, ropes, or, lines, the, mass, and, exposed, surface, to, air, movement, of, a, medium, sized, balloon, is, sufficient, to, cause, rope, friction, burns, to, the, hands, of, anyone, trying, to, stop, or, prevent, movement, the, ground, crew, should, also, wear, sturdy, shoes, and, at, least, long, pants, in, case, of, the, need, to, access, a, landing, or, landed, balloon, in, rough, or, overgrown, terrain, as, with, aircraft, hot, air, balloons, require, regular, maintenance, to, remain, airworthy, as, aircraft, made, of, fabric, and, that, lack, direct, horizontal, control, hot, air, balloons, may, occasionally, require, repairs, to, rips, or, snags, while, some, operations, such, as, cleaning, and, drying, may, be, performed, by, the, owner, or, pilot, other, operations, such, as, sewing, must, be, performed, by, a, qualified, repair, technician, and, recorded, in, the, balloon, s, maintenance, log, book, to, ensure, long, life, and, safe, operation, the, envelope, should, be, kept, clean, and, dry, this, prevents, mold, and, mildew, from, forming, on, the, fabric, and, abrasion, from, occurring, during, packing, transport, and, unpacking, due, to, contact, with, foreign, particles, in, the, event, of, a, landing, in, a, wet, because, of, precipitation, or, early, morning, or, late, evening, dew, or, muddy, location, farmer, s, field, the, envelope, should, be, cleaned, and, laid, out, or, hung, to, dry, the, burner, and, fuel, system, must, also, be, kept, clean, to, ensure, safe, operation, on, demand, damaged, fuel, hoses, need, to, be, replaced, stuck, or, leaky, valves, must, be, repaired, or, replaced, the, wicker, basket, may, require, occasional, refinishing, or, repair, the, skids, on, its, bottom, may, require, occasional, replacement, balloons, in, most, parts, of, the, world, are, maintained, in, accordance, with, a, fixed, manufacturer, s, maintenance, schedule, that, includes, regular, 100, flight, hours, or, 12, month, inspections, in, addition, to, maintenance, work, to, correct, any, damage, in, australia, balloons, used, for, carrying, commercial, passengers, must, be, inspected, and, maintained, by, approved, workshops, in, the, case, of, a, snag, burn, or, rip, in, the, envelope, fabric, a, patch, may, be, applied, or, the, affected, panel, completely, replaced, patches, may, be, held, in, place, with, glue, tape, stitching, or, a, combination, of, these, techniques, replacing, an, entire, panel, requires, the, stitching, around, the, old, panel, to, be, removed, and, a, new, panel, to, be, sewn, in, with, the, appropriate, technique, thread, and, stitch, pattern, depending, on, the, size, of, the, balloon, location, and, intended, use, hot, air, balloons, and, their, pilots, need, to, comply, with, a, variety, of, regulations, as, with, other, aircraft, in, the, us, balloons, must, be, registered, have, an, n, number, have, an, airworthiness, certificate, and, pass, annual, inspections, balloons, below, a, certain, size, empty, weight, of, less, than, 155, pounds, or, 70, kg, including, envelope, basket, burners, and, empty, fuel, tanks, can, be, used, as, an, ultralight, aircraft, in, australia, private, balloon, pilots, are, managed, by, the, australian, ballooning, federation, and, typically, become, members, of, regional, hot, air, ballooning, clubs, commercial, operations, carrying, fare, paying, passengers, or, charging, for, promotional, flights, must, operate, under, an, air, operators, certificate, from, the, australian, civil, aviation, and, safety, authority, casa, with, a, nominated, chief, pilot, pilots, must, have, different, degrees, of, experience, before, they, are, allowed, to, progress, to, larger, balloons, hot, air, balloons, must, be, registered, aircraft, with, casa, and, are, subject, to, regular, airworthiness, checks, by, authorised, personnel, in, the, uk, the, person, in, command, must, hold, a, valid, private, pilot, s, licence, issued, by, the, civil, aviation, authority, specifically, for, ballooning, this, is, known, as, the, ppl, b, there, are, two, types, of, commercial, balloon, licences, cpl, b, restricted, and, cpl, b, full, the, cpl, b, restricted, is, required, if, the, pilot, is, undertaking, work, for, a, sponsor, or, being, paid, by, an, external, agent, to, operate, a, balloon, the, pilot, can, fly, a, sponsored, balloon, with, everything, paid, for, with, a, ppl, unless, asked, to, attend, any, event, then, a, cpl, b, restricted, is, required, the, cpl, b, is, required, if, the, pilot, is, flying, passengers, for, money, the, balloon, then, needs, a, transport, category, c, of, a, certificate, of, air, worthiness, if, the, pilot, is, only, flying, sponsor, s, guests, and, not, charging, money, for, flying, other, passengers, then, the, pilot, is, exempted, from, holding, an, aoc, air, operator, s, certificate, though, a, copy, of, it, is, required, for, passenger, flying, the, balloon, also, requires, a, maintenance, log, in, the, united, states, a, pilot, of, a, hot, air, balloon, must, have, a, pilot, certificate, from, the, federal, aviation, administration, faa, carrying, the, rating, of, lighter, than, air, free, balloon, and, unless, the, pilot, is, also, qualified, to, fly, gas, balloons, will, also, carry, this, limitation, limited, to, hot, air, balloons, with, airborne, heater, a, pilot, does, not, need, a, license, to, fly, an, ultralight, aircraft, but, training, is, highly, advised, and, some, hot, air, balloons, meet, the, criteria, to, carry, paying, passengers, for, hire, and, attend, some, balloon, festivals, a, pilot, must, have, a, commercial, pilot, certificate, commercial, hot, air, balloon, pilots, may, also, act, as, hot, air, balloon, flight, instructors, while, most, balloon, pilots, fly, for, the, pure, joy, of, floating, through, the, air, many, are, able, to, make, a, living, as, a, professional, balloon, pilot, some, professional, pilots, fly, commercial, passenger, sightseeing, flights, while, others, fly, corporate, advertising, balloons, the, largest, manufacturer, of, hot, air, balloons, is, cameron, balloons, of, bristol, england, which, also, owns, lindstrand, balloons, of, oswestry, england, cameron, balloons, lindstrand, balloons, and, another, english, balloon, manufacturing, company, thunder, and, colt, since, acquired, by, cameron, have, been, innovators, and, developers, of, special, shaped, balloons, these, hot, air, balloons, use, the, same, principle, of, lift, as, conventional, inverted, teardrop, shaped, balloons, but, often, sections, of, the, special, balloon, envelope, shape, do, not, contribute, to, the, balloon, s, ability, to, stay, aloft, the, second, largest, manufacturer, of, hot, air, balloons, is, ultramagic, company, based, in, spain, which, produces, from, 80, to, 120, balloons, per, year, ultramagic, can, produce, very, large, balloons, such, as, the, n, 500, that, accommodates, as, many, as, 27, persons, in, the, basket, and, has, also, produced, many, balloons, with, special, shapes, as, well, as, cold, air, inflatables, one, of, the, three, largest, companies, in, the, world, is, kubicek, balloons, from, its, factory, in, brno, czechia, the, company, ships, its, products, worldwide, produces, from, 100, to, 115, balloons, per, year, kubicek, company, also, focus, on, special, shape, balloons, faa, easa, type, certified, and, are, delivered, with, a, standard, airworthiness, certificate, in, the, usa, aerostar, international, inc, of, sioux, falls, south, dakota, was, north, america, s, largest, balloon, manufacturer, and, a,
