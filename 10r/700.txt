an, aircraft, pl, aircraft, is, a, vehicle, that, is, able, to, fly, by, gaining, support, from, the, air, it, counters, the, force, of, gravity, by, using, either, static, lift, or, the, dynamic, lift, of, an, airfoil, or, in, a, few, cases, direct, downward, thrust, from, its, engines, common, examples, of, aircraft, include, airplanes, helicopters, airships, including, blimps, gliders, paramotors, and, hot, air, balloons, the, human, activity, that, surrounds, aircraft, is, called, aviation, the, science, of, aviation, including, designing, and, building, aircraft, is, called, aeronautics, crewed, aircraft, are, flown, by, an, onboard, pilot, whereas, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, may, be, remotely, controlled, or, self, controlled, by, onboard, computers, aircraft, may, be, classified, by, different, criteria, such, as, lift, type, aircraft, propulsion, if, any, usage, and, others, flying, model, craft, and, stories, of, manned, flight, go, back, many, centuries, however, the, first, manned, ascent, and, safe, descent, in, modern, times, took, place, by, larger, hot, air, balloons, developed, in, the, 18th, century, each, of, the, two, world, wars, led, to, great, technical, advances, consequently, the, history, of, aircraft, can, be, divided, into, five, eras, aerostats, use, buoyancy, to, float, in, the, air, in, much, the, same, way, that, ships, float, on, the, water, they, are, characterized, by, one, or, more, large, cells, or, canopies, filled, with, a, relatively, low, density, gas, such, as, helium, hydrogen, or, hot, air, which, is, less, dense, than, the, surrounding, air, when, the, weight, of, this, is, added, to, the, weight, of, the, aircraft, structure, it, adds, up, to, the, same, weight, as, the, air, that, the, craft, displaces, small, hot, air, balloons, called, sky, lanterns, were, first, invented, in, ancient, china, prior, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, used, primarily, in, cultural, celebrations, and, were, only, the, second, type, of, aircraft, to, fly, the, first, being, kites, which, were, first, invented, in, ancient, china, over, two, thousand, years, ago, see, han, dynasty, a, balloon, was, originally, any, aerostat, while, the, term, airship, was, used, for, large, powered, aircraft, designs, usually, fixed, wing, in, 1919, frederick, handley, page, was, reported, as, referring, to, ships, of, the, air, with, smaller, passenger, types, as, air, yachts, in, the, 1930s, large, intercontinental, flying, boats, were, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, ships, of, the, air, or, flying, ships, though, none, had, yet, been, built, the, advent, of, powered, balloons, called, dirigible, balloons, and, later, of, rigid, hulls, allowing, a, great, increase, in, size, began, to, change, the, way, these, words, were, used, huge, powered, aerostats, characterized, by, a, rigid, outer, framework, and, separate, aerodynamic, skin, surrounding, the, gas, bags, were, produced, the, zeppelins, being, the, largest, and, most, famous, there, were, still, no, fixed, wing, aircraft, or, non, rigid, balloons, large, enough, to, be, called, airships, so, airship, came, to, be, synonymous, with, these, aircraft, then, several, accidents, such, as, the, hindenburg, disaster, in, 1937, led, to, the, demise, of, these, airships, nowadays, a, balloon, is, an, unpowered, aerostat, and, an, airship, is, a, powered, one, a, powered, steerable, aerostat, is, called, a, dirigible, sometimes, this, term, is, applied, only, to, non, rigid, balloons, and, sometimes, dirigible, balloon, is, regarded, as, the, definition, of, an, airship, which, may, then, be, rigid, or, non, rigid, non, rigid, dirigibles, are, characterized, by, a, moderately, aerodynamic, gasbag, with, stabilizing, fins, at, the, back, these, soon, became, known, as, blimps, during, world, war, ii, this, shape, was, widely, adopted, for, tethered, balloons, in, windy, weather, this, both, reduces, the, strain, on, the, tether, and, stabilizes, the, balloon, the, nickname, blimp, was, adopted, along, with, the, shape, in, modern, times, any, small, dirigible, or, airship, is, called, a, blimp, though, a, blimp, may, be, unpowered, as, well, as, powered, heavier, than, air, aircraft, such, as, airplanes, must, find, some, way, to, push, air, or, gas, downwards, so, that, a, reaction, occurs, by, newton, s, laws, of, motion, to, push, the, aircraft, upwards, this, dynamic, movement, through, the, air, is, the, origin, of, the, term, there, are, two, ways, to, produce, dynamic, upthrust, aerodynamic, lift, and, powered, lift, in, the, form, of, engine, thrust, aerodynamic, lift, involving, wings, is, the, most, common, with, fixed, wing, aircraft, being, kept, in, the, air, by, the, forward, movement, of, wings, and, rotorcraft, by, spinning, wing, shaped, rotors, sometimes, called, rotary, wings, a, wing, is, a, flat, horizontal, surface, usually, shaped, in, cross, section, as, an, aerofoil, to, fly, air, must, flow, over, the, wing, and, generate, lift, a, flexible, wing, is, a, wing, made, of, fabric, or, thin, sheet, material, often, stretched, over, a, rigid, frame, a, kite, is, tethered, to, the, ground, and, relies, on, the, speed, of, the, wind, over, its, wings, which, may, be, flexible, or, rigid, fixed, or, rotary, with, powered, lift, the, aircraft, directs, its, engine, thrust, vertically, downward, v, stol, aircraft, such, as, the, harrier, jump, jet, and, lockheed, martin, f, 35b, take, off, and, land, vertically, using, powered, lift, and, transfer, to, aerodynamic, lift, in, steady, flight, a, pure, rocket, is, not, usually, regarded, as, an, aerodyne, because, it, does, not, depend, on, the, air, for, its, lift, and, can, even, fly, into, space, however, many, aerodynamic, lift, vehicles, have, been, powered, or, assisted, by, rocket, motors, rocket, powered, missiles, that, obtain, aerodynamic, lift, at, very, high, speed, due, to, airflow, over, their, bodies, are, a, marginal, case, the, forerunner, of, the, fixed, wing, aircraft, is, the, kite, whereas, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, relies, on, its, forward, speed, to, create, airflow, over, the, wings, a, kite, is, tethered, to, the, ground, and, relies, on, the, wind, blowing, over, its, wings, to, provide, lift, kites, were, the, first, kind, of, aircraft, to, fly, and, were, invented, in, china, around, 500, bc, much, aerodynamic, research, was, done, with, kites, before, test, aircraft, wind, tunnels, and, computer, modelling, programs, became, available, the, first, heavier, than, air, craft, capable, of, controlled, free, flight, were, gliders, a, glider, designed, by, george, cayley, carried, out, the, first, true, manned, controlled, flight, in, 1853, the, first, powered, and, controllable, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, airplane, or, aeroplane, was, invented, by, wilbur, and, orville, wright, besides, the, method, of, propulsion, if, any, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, in, general, characterized, by, their, wing, configuration, the, most, important, wing, characteristics, are, a, variable, geometry, aircraft, can, change, its, wing, configuration, during, flight, a, flying, wing, has, no, fuselage, though, it, may, have, small, blisters, or, pods, the, opposite, of, this, is, a, lifting, body, which, has, no, wings, though, it, may, have, small, stabilizing, and, control, surfaces, wing, in, ground, effect, vehicles, are, generally, not, considered, aircraft, they, fly, efficiently, close, to, the, surface, of, the, ground, or, water, like, conventional, aircraft, during, takeoff, an, example, is, the, russian, ekranoplan, nicknamed, the, caspian, sea, monster, man, powered, aircraft, also, rely, on, ground, effect, to, remain, airborne, with, minimal, pilot, power, but, this, is, only, because, they, are, so, underpowered, in, fact, the, airframe, is, capable, of, flying, higher, rotorcraft, or, rotary, wing, aircraft, use, a, spinning, rotor, with, aerofoil, cross, section, blades, a, rotary, wing, to, provide, lift, types, include, helicopters, autogyros, and, various, hybrids, such, as, gyrodynes, and, compound, rotorcraft, helicopters, have, a, rotor, turned, by, an, engine, driven, shaft, the, rotor, pushes, air, downward, to, create, lift, by, tilting, the, rotor, forward, the, downward, flow, is, tilted, backward, producing, thrust, for, forward, flight, some, helicopters, have, more, than, one, rotor, and, a, few, have, rotors, turned, by, gas, jets, at, the, tips, some, have, a, tail, rotor, to, counteract, the, rotation, of, the, main, rotor, and, to, aid, directional, control, autogyros, have, unpowered, rotors, with, a, separate, power, plant, to, provide, thrust, the, rotor, is, tilted, backward, as, the, autogyro, moves, forward, air, blows, upward, across, the, rotor, making, it, spin, this, spinning, increases, the, speed, of, airflow, over, the, rotor, to, provide, lift, rotor, kites, are, unpowered, autogyros, which, are, towed, to, give, them, forward, speed, or, tethered, to, a, static, anchor, in, high, wind, for, kited, flight, compound, rotorcraft, have, wings, that, provide, some, or, all, of, the, lift, in, forward, flight, they, are, nowadays, classified, as, powered, lift, types, and, not, as, rotorcraft, tiltrotor, aircraft, such, as, the, bell, boeing, v, 22, osprey, tiltwing, tail, sitter, and, coleopter, aircraft, have, their, rotors, propellers, horizontal, for, vertical, flight, and, vertical, for, forward, flight, the, smallest, aircraft, are, toys, recreational, items, and, nano, aircraft, the, largest, aircraft, by, dimensions, and, volume, as, of, 2016, is, the, 302, ft, 92, m, long,

of, ground, effect, the, largest, civilian, airplanes, apart, from, the, above, noted, an, 225, and, an, 124, are, the, airbus, beluga, cargo, transport, derivative, of, the, airbus, a300, jet, airliner, the, boeing, dreamlifter, cargo, transport, derivative, of, the, boeing, 747, jet, airliner, transport, the, 747, 200b, was, at, its, creation, in, the, 1960s, the, heaviest, aircraft, ever, built, with, a, maximum, weight, of, over, 400, t, 880, 000, lb, and, the, double, decker, airbus, a380, super, jumbo, jet, airliner, the, world, s, largest, passenger, airliner, the, fastest, fixed,

breathing, powered, airplane, is, the, lockheed, sr, 71, blackbird, a, u, s, reconnaissance, jet, fixed, wing, aircraft, having, reached, 3, 530, km, h, 2, 193, mph, on, 28, july, 1976, gliders, are, heavier, than, air, aircraft, that, do, not, employ, propulsion, once, airborne, take, off, may, be, by, launching, forward, and, downward, from, a, high, location, or, by, pulling, into, the, air, on, a, tow, line, either, by, a, ground, based, winch, or, vehicle, or, by, a, powered, tug, aircraft, for, a, glider, to, maintain, its, forward, air, speed, and, lift, it, must, descend, in, relation, to, the, air, but, not, necessarily, in, relation, to, the, ground, many, gliders, can, soar, i, e, gain, height, from, updrafts, such, as, thermal, currents, the, first, practical, controllable, example, was, designed, and, built, by, the, british, scientist, and, pioneer, george, cayley, whom, many, recognise, as, the, first, aeronautical, engineer, common, examples, of, gliders, are, sailplanes, hang, gliders, and, paragliders, balloons, drift, with, the, wind, though, normally, the, pilot, can, control, the, altitude, either, by, heating, the, air, or, by, releasing, ballast, giving, some, directional, control, since, the, wind, direction, changes, with, altitude, a, wing, shaped, hybrid, balloon, can, glide, directionally, when, rising, or, falling, but, a, spherically, shaped, balloon, does, not, have, such, directional, control, kites, are, aircraft, that, are, tethered, to, the, ground, or, other, object, fixed, or, mobile, that, maintains, tension, in, the, tether, or, kite, line, they, rely, on, virtual, or, real, wind, blowing, over, and, under, them, to, generate, lift, and, drag, kytoons, are, balloon, kite, hybrids, that, are, shaped, and, tethered, to, obtain, kiting, deflections, and, can, be, lighter, than, air, neutrally, buoyant, or, heavier, than, air, powered, aircraft, have, one, or, more, onboard, sources, of, mechanical, power, typically, aircraft, engines, although, rubber, and, manpower, have, also, been, used, most, aircraft, engines, are, either, lightweight, reciprocating, engines, or, gas, turbines, engine, fuel, is, stored, in, tanks, usually, in, the, wings, but, larger, aircraft, also, have, additional, fuel, tanks, in, the, fuselage, propeller, aircraft, use, one, or, more, propellers, airscrews, to, create, thrust, in, a, forward, direction, the, propeller, is, usually, mounted, in, front, of, the, power, source, in, tractor, configuration, but, can, be, mounted, behind, in, pusher, configuration, variations, of, propeller, layout, include, contra, rotating, propellers, and, ducted, fans, many, kinds, of, power, plant, have, been, used, to, drive, propellers, early, airships, used, man, power, or, steam, engines, the, more, practical, internal, combustion, piston, engine, was, used, for, virtually, all, fixed, wing, aircraft, until, world, war, ii, and, is, still, used, in, many, smaller, aircraft, some, types, use, turbine, engines, to, drive, a, propeller, in, the, form, of, a, turboprop, or, propfan, human, powered, flight, has, been, achieved, but, has, not, become, a, practical, means, of, transport, unmanned, aircraft, and, models, have, also, used, power, sources, such, as, electric, motors, and, rubber, bands, jet, aircraft, use, airbreathing, jet, engines, which, take, in, air, burn, fuel, with, it, in, a, combustion, chamber, and, accelerate, the, exhaust, rearwards, to, provide, thrust, different, jet, engine, configurations, include, the, turbojet, and, turbofan, sometimes, with, the, addition, of, an, afterburner, those, with, no, rotating, turbomachinery, include, the, pulsejet, and, ramjet, these, mechanically, simple, engines, produce, no, thrust, when, stationary, so, the, aircraft, must, be, launched, to, flying, speed, using, a, catapult, like, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, or, a, rocket, for, example, other, engine, types, include, the, motorjet, and, the, dual, cycle, pratt, whitney, j58, compared, to, engines, using, propellers, jet, engines, can, provide, much, higher, thrust, higher, speeds, and, above, about, 40, 000, ft, 12, 000, m, greater, efficiency, they, are, also, much, more, fuel, efficient, than, rockets, as, a, consequence, nearly, all, large, high, speed, or, high, altitude, aircraft, use, jet, engines, some, rotorcraft, such, as, helicopters, have, a, powered, rotary, wing, or, rotor, where, the, rotor, disc, can, be, angled, slightly, forward, so, that, a, proportion, of, its, lift, is, directed, forwards, the, rotor, may, like, a, propeller, be, powered, by, a, variety, of, methods, such, as, a, piston, engine, or, turbine, experiments, have, also, used, jet, nozzles, at, the, rotor, blade, tips, aircraft, are, designed, according, to, many, factors, such, as, customer, and, manufacturer, demand, safety, protocols, and, physical, and, economic, constraints, for, many, types, of, aircraft, the, design, process, is, regulated, by, national, airworthiness, authorities, the, key, parts, of, an, aircraft, are, generally, divided, into, three, categories, the, approach, to, structural, design, varies, widely, between, different, types, of, aircraft, some, such, as, paragliders, comprise, only, flexible, materials, that, act, in, tension, and, rely, on, aerodynamic, pressure, to, hold, their, shape, a, balloon, similarly, relies, on, internal, gas, pressure, but, may, have, a, rigid, basket, or, gondola, slung, below, it, to, carry, its, payload, early, aircraft, including, airships, often, employed, flexible, doped, aircraft, fabric, covering, to, give, a, reasonably, smooth, aeroshell, stretched, over, a, rigid, frame, later, aircraft, employed, semi, monocoque, techniques, where, the, skin, of, the, aircraft, is, stiff, enough, to, share, much, of, the, flight, loads, in, a, true, monocoque, design, there, is, no, internal, structure, left, the, key, structural, parts, of, an, aircraft, depend, on, what, type, it, is, lighter, than, air, types, are, characterised, by, one, or, more, gasbags, typically, with, a, supporting, structure, of, flexible, cables, or, a, rigid, framework, called, its, hull, other, elements, such, as, engines, or, a, gondola, may, also, be, attached, to, the, supporting, structure, heavier, than, air, types, are, characterised, by, one, or, more, wings, and, a, central, fuselage, the, fuselage, typically, also, carries, a, tail, or, empennage, for, stability, and, control, and, an, undercarriage, for, takeoff, and, landing, engines, may, be, located, on, the, fuselage, or, wings, on, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, wings, are, rigidly, attached, to, the, fuselage, while, on, a, rotorcraft, the, wings, are, attached, to, a, rotating, vertical, shaft, smaller, designs, sometimes, use, flexible, materials, for, part, or, all, of, the, structure, held, in, place, either, by, a, rigid, frame, or, by, air, pressure, the, fixed, parts, of, the, structure, comprise, the, airframe, the, source, of, motive, power, for, an, aircraft, is, normally, called, the, powerplant, and, includes, engine, or, motor, propeller, or, rotor, if, any, jet, nozzles, and, thrust, reversers, if, any, and, accessories, essential, to, the, functioning, of, the, engine, or, motor, e, g, starter, ignition, system, intake, system, exhaust, system, fuel, system, lubrication, system, engine, cooling, system, and, engine, controls, powered, aircraft, are, typically, powered, by, internal, combustion, engines, piston, or, turbine, burning, fossil, fuels, typically, gasoline, avgas, or, jet, fuel, a, very, few, are, powered, by, rocket, power, ramjet, propulsion, or, by, electric, motors, or, by, internal, combustion, engines, of, other, types, or, using, other, fuels, a, very, few, have, been, powered, for, short, flights, by, human, muscle, energy, e, g, gossamer, condor, the, avionics, comprise, any, electronic, aircraft, flight, control, systems, and, related, equipment, including, electronic, cockpit, instrumentation, navigation, radar, monitoring, and, communications, systems, the, flight, envelope, of, an, aircraft, refers, to, its, approved, design, capabilities, in, terms, of, airspeed, load, factor, and, altitude, the, term, can, also, refer, to, other, assessments, of, aircraft, performance, such, as, maneuverability, when, an, aircraft, is, abused, for, instance, by, diving, it, at, too, high, a, speed, it, is, said, to, be, flown, outside, the, envelope, something, considered, foolhardy, since, it, has, been, taken, beyond, the, design, limits, which, have, been, established, by, the, manufacturer, going, beyond, the, envelope, may, have, a, known, outcome, such, as, flutter, or, entry, to, a, non, recoverable, spin, possible, reasons, for, the, boundary, the, range, is, the, distance, an, aircraft, can, fly, between, takeoff, and, landing, as, limited, by, the, time, it, can, remain, airborne, for, a, powered, aircraft, the, time, limit, is, determined, by, the, fuel, load, and, rate, of, consumption, for, an, unpowered, aircraft, the, maximum, flight, time, is, limited, by, factors, such, as, weather, conditions, and, pilot, endurance, many, aircraft, types, are, restricted, to, daylight, hours, while, balloons, are, limited, by, their, supply, of, lifting, gas, the, range, can, be, seen, as, the, average, ground, speed, multiplied, by, the, maximum, time, in, the, air, the, airbus, a350, 900ulr, is, among, the, longest, range, airliners, flight, dynamics, is, the, science, of, air, vehicle, orientation, and, control, in, three, dimensions, the, three, critical, flight, dynamics, parameters, are, the, angles, of, rotation, around, three, axes, which, pass, through, the, vehicle, s, center, of, gravity, known, as, pitch, roll, and, yaw, flight, dynamics, is, concerned, with, the, stability, and, control, of, an, aircraft, s, rotation, about, each, of, these, axes, an, aircraft, that, is, unstable, tends, to, diverge, from, its, intended, flight, path, and, so, is, difficult, to, fly, a, very, stable, aircraft, tends, to, stay, on, its, flight, path, and, is, difficult, to, maneuver, therefore, it, is, important, for, any, design, to, achieve, the, desired, degree, of, stability, since, the, widespread, use, of, digital, computers, it, is, increasingly, common, for, designs, to, be, inherently, unstable, and, rely, on, computerised, control, systems, to, provide, artificial, stability, a, fixed, wing, is, typically, unstable, in, pitch, roll, and, yaw, pitch, and, yaw, stabilities, of, conventional, fixed, wing, designs, require, horizontal, and, vertical, stabilisers, which, act, similarly, to, the, feathers, on, an, arrow, these, stabilizing, surfaces, allow, equilibrium, of, aerodynamic, forces, and, to, stabilise, the, flight, dynamics, of, pitch, and, yaw, they, are, usually, mounted, on, the, tail, section, empennage, although, in, the, canard, layout, the, main, aft, wing, replaces, the, canard, foreplane, as, pitch, stabilizer, tandem, wing, and, tailless, aircraft, rely, on, the, same, general, rule, to, achieve, stability, the, aft, surface, being, the, stabilising, one, a, rotary, wing, is, typically, unstable, in, yaw, requiring, a, vertical, stabiliser, a, balloon, is, typically, very, stable, in, pitch, and, roll, due, to, the, way, the, payload, is, slung, underneath, the, center, of, lift, flight, control, surfaces, enable, the, pilot, to, control, an, aircraft, s, flight, attitude, and, are, usually, part, of, the, wing, or, mounted, on, or, integral, with, the, associated, stabilizing, surface, their, development, was, a, critical, advance, in, the, history, of, aircraft, which, had, until, that, point, been, uncontrollable, in, flight, aerospace, engineers, develop, control, systems, for, a, vehicle, s, orientation, attitude, about, its, center, of, mass, the, control, systems, include, actuators, which, exert, forces, in, various, directions, and, generate, rotational, forces, or, moments, about, the, aerodynamic, center, of, the, aircraft, and, thus, rotate, the, aircraft, in, pitch, roll, or, yaw, for, example, a, pitching, moment, is, a, vertical, force, applied, at, a, distance, forward, or, aft, from, the, aerodynamic, center, of, the, aircraft, causing, the, aircraft, to, pitch, up, or, down, control, systems, are, also, sometimes, used, to, increase, or, decrease, drag, for, example, to, slow, the, aircraft, to, a, safe, speed, for, landing, the, two, main, aerodynamic, forces, acting, on, any, aircraft, are, lift, supporting, it, in, the, air, and, drag, opposing, its, motion, control, surfaces, or, other, techniques, may, also, be, used, to, affect, these, forces, directly, without, inducing, any, rotation, aircraft, permit, long, distance, high, speed, travel, and, may, be, a, more, fuel, efficient, mode, of, transportation, in, some, circumstances, aircraft, have, environmental, and, climate, impacts, beyond, fuel, efficiency, considerations, however, they, are, also, relatively, noisy, compared, to, other, forms, of, travel, and, high, altitude, aircraft, generate, contrails, which, experimental, evidence, suggests, may, alter, weather, patterns, aircraft, are, produced, in, several, different, types, optimized, for, various, uses, military, aircraft, which, includes, not, just, combat, types, but, many, types, of, supporting, aircraft, and, civil, aircraft, which, include, all, non, military, types, experimental, and, model, a, military, aircraft, is, any, aircraft, that, is, operated, by, a, legal, or, insurrectionary, armed, service, of, any, type, military, aircraft, can, be, either, combat, or, non, combat, most, military, aircraft, are, powered, heavier, than, air, types, other, types, such, as, gliders, and, balloons, have, also, been, used, as, military, aircraft, for, example, balloons, were, used, for, observation, during, the, american, civil, war, and, world, war, i, and, military, gliders, were, used, during, world, war, ii, to, land, troops, civil, aircraft, divide, into, commercial, and, general, types, however, there, are, some, overlaps, commercial, aircraft, include, types, designed, for, scheduled, and, charter, airline, flights, carrying, passengers, mail, and, other, cargo, the, larger, passenger, carrying, types, are, the, airliners, the, largest, of, which, are, wide, body, aircraft, some, of, the, smaller, types, are, also, used, in, general, aviation, and, some, of, the, larger, types, are, used, as, vip, aircraft, general, aviation, is, a, catch, all, covering, other, kinds, of, private, where, the, pilot, is, not, paid, for, time, or, expenses, and, commercial, use, and, involving, a, wide, range, of, aircraft, types, such, as, business, jets, bizjets, trainers, homebuilt, gliders, warbirds, and, hot, air, balloons, to, name, a, few, the, vast, majority, of, aircraft, today, are, general, aviation, types, an, experimental, aircraft, is, one, that, has, not, been, fully, proven, in, flight, or, that, carries, a, special, airworthiness, certificate, called, an, experimental, certificate, in, united, states, parlance, this, often, implies, that, the, aircraft, is, testing, new, aerospace, technologies, though, the, term, also, refers, to, amateur, built, and, kit, built, aircraft, many, of, which, are, based, on, proven, designs, a, model, aircraft, is, a, small, unmanned, type, made, to, fly, for, fun, for, static, display, for, aerodynamic, research, or, for, other, purposes, a, scale, model, is, a, replica, of,
