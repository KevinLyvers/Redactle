while, passports, are, typically, issued, by, national, governments, certain, subnational, entities, are, authorised, to, issue, passports, to, citizens, residing, within, their, borders, additionally, other, types, of, official, documents, may, serve, a, similar, role, to, passports, but, are, subject, to, different, eligibility, requirements, purposes, or, restrictions, etymological, sources, show, that, the, term, passport, may, derive, from, a, document, required, by, some, medieval, italian, states, in, order, for, an, individual, to, pass, through, the, physical, harbor, italian, passa, porto, to, pass, the, harbor, or, gate, italian, passa, porte, to, pass, the, gates, of, a, walled, city, or, jurisdiction, such, documents, were, issued, by, local, authorities, to,

obligations, to, provide, poor, relief, were, an, important, source, of, the, desire, for, controls, on, movement, 10, one, of, the, earliest, known, references, to, paperwork, that, served, an, analogous, role, to, a, passport, is, found, in, the, hebrew, bible, nehemiah, 2, 7, 9, dating, from, approximately, 450, bc, states, that, nehemiah, an, official, serving, king, artaxerxes, i, of, persia, asked, permission, to, travel, to, judea, the, king, granted, leave, and, gave, him, a, letter, to, the, governors, beyond, the, river, requesting, safe, passage, for, him, as, he, traveled, through, their, lands, the, ancient, indian, political, text, arthashastra, third, century, bce, mentions, passes, issued, at, the, rate, of, one, masha, per, pass, to, enter, and, exit, the, country, and, describes, the, duties, of, the, mudr, dhyak, a, lit, superintendent, of, seals, who, must, issue, sealed, passes, before, a, person, could, enter, or, leave, the, countryside, passports, were, an, important, part, of, the, chinese, bureaucracy, as, early, as, the, western, han, 202, bc, 9, ad, if, not, in, the, qin, dynasty, they, required, such, details, as, age, height, and, bodily, features, these, passports, zhuan, determined, a, person, s, ability, to, move, throughout, imperial, counties, and, through, points, of, control, even, children, needed, passports, but, those, of, one, year, or, less, who, were, in, their, mother, s, care, may, not, have, needed, them, in, the, medieval, islamic, caliphate, a, form, of, passport, was, the, bara, a, a, receipt, for, taxes, paid, only, people, who, paid, their, zakah, for, muslims, or, jizya, for, dhimmis, taxes, were, permitted, to, travel, to, different, regions, of, the, caliphate, thus, the, bara, a, receipt, was, a, basic, passport, in, the, 12th, century, the, republic, of, genoa, issued, a, document, called, bulletta, which, was, issued, to, the, nationals, of, the, republic, who, were, traveling, to, the, ports, of, the, emporiums, and, the, ports, of, the, genoese, colonies, overseas, as, well, as, to, foreigners, who, entered, them, king, henry, v, of, england, is, credited, with, having, invented, what, some, consider, the, first, british, passport, in, the, modern, sense, as, a, means, of, helping, his, subjects, prove, who, they, were, in, foreign, lands, the, earliest, reference, to, these, documents, is, found, in, a, 1414, act, of, parliament, in, 1540, granting, travel, documents, in, england, became, a, role, of, the, privy, council, of, england, and, it, was, around, this, time, that, the, term, passport, was, used, in, 1794, issuing, british, passports, became, the, job, of, the, office, of, the, secretary, of, state, in, the, holy, roman, empire, the, 1548, imperial, diet, of, augsburg, required, the, public, to, hold, imperial, documents, for, travel, at, the, risk, of, permanent, exile, in, 1791, louis, xvi, masqueraded, as, a, valet, during, his, flight, to, varennes, as, passports, for, the, nobility, typically, included, a, number, of, persons, listed, by, their, function, but, without, further, description, 31, 32, a, pass, card, treaty, of, october,

were, not, to, receive, pass, cards, 92, 93, a, rapid, expansion, of, railway, infrastructure, and, wealth, in, europe, beginning, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, led, to, large, increases, in, the, volume, of, international, travel, and, a, consequent, unique, dilution, of, the, passport, system, for, approximately, thirty, years, prior, to, world, war, i, the, speed, of, trains, as, well, as, the, number, of, passengers, that, crossed, multiple, borders, made, enforcement, of, passport, laws, difficult, the, general, reaction, was, the, relaxation, of, passport, requirements, in, the, later, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, up, to, world, war, i, passports, were, not, required, on, the, whole, for, travel, within, europe, and, crossing, a, border, was, a, relatively, straightforward, procedure, consequently, comparatively, few, people, held, passports, during, world, war, i, european, governments, introduced, border, passport, requirements, for, security, reasons, and, to, control, the, emigration, of, people, with, useful, skills, these, controls, remained, in, place, after, the, war, becoming, a, standard, though, controversial, procedure, british, tourists, of, the, 1920s, complained, especially, about, attached, photographs, and, physical, descriptions, which, they, considered, led, to, a, nasty, dehumanisation, the, british, nationality, and, status, of, aliens, act, was, passed, in, 1914, clearly, defining, the, notions, of, citizenship, and, creating, a, booklet, form, of, the, passport, in, 1920, the, league, of, nations, held, a, conference, on, passports, the, paris, conference, on, passports, customs, formalities, and, through, tickets, passport, guidelines, and, a, general, booklet, design, resulted, from, the, conference, which, was, followed, up, by, conferences, in, 1926, and, 1927, the, league, of, nations, issued, nansen, passports, to, stateless, refugees, from, 1922, to, 1938, while, the, united, nations, held, a, travel, conference, in, 1963, no, passport, guidelines, resulted, from, it, passport, standardization, came, about, in, 1980, under, the, auspices, of, the, icao, icao, standards, include, those, for, machine, readable, passports, such, passports, have, an, area, where, some, of, the, information, otherwise, written, in, textual, form, is, written, as, strings, of, alphanumeric, characters, printed, in, a, manner, suitable, for, optical, character, recognition, this, enables, border, controllers, and, other, law, enforcement, agents, to, process, these, passports, more, quickly, without, having, to, input, the, information, manually, into, a, computer, icao, publishes, doc, 9303, machine, readable, travel, documents, the, technical, standard, for, machine, readable, passports, a, more, recent, standard, is, for, biometric, passports, these, contain, biometrics, to, authenticate, the, identity, of, travellers, the, passport, s, critical, information, is, stored, on, a, tiny, rfid, computer, chip, much, like, information, stored, on, smartcards, like, some, smartcards, the, passport, booklet, design, calls, for, an, embedded, contactless, chip, that, is, able, to, hold, digital, signature, data, to, ensure, the, integrity, of, the, passport, and, the, biometric, data, historically, legal, authority, to, issue, passports, is, founded, on, the, exercise, of, each, country, s, executive, discretion, certain, legal, tenets, follow, namely, first, passports, are, issued, in, the, name, of, the, state, second, no, person, has, a, legal, right, to, be, issued, a, passport, third, each, country, s, government, in, exercising, its, executive, discretion, has, complete, and, unfettered, discretion, to, refuse, to, issue, or, to, revoke, a, passport, and, fourth, that, the, latter, discretion, is, not, subject, to, judicial, review, however, legal, scholars, including, a, j, arkelian, have, argued, that, evolutions, in, both, the, constitutional, law, of, democratic, countries, and, the, international, law, applicable, to, all, countries, now, render, those, historical, tenets, both, obsolete, and, unlawful, governments, around, the, world, issue, a, variety, of, passports, for, different, purposes, the, most, common, variety, are, ordinary, passports, issued, to, individual, citizens, and, other, nationals, in, the, past, certain, countries, issued, collective, passports, or, family, passports, today, passports, are, typically, issued, to, individual, travellers, rather, than, groups, aside, from, ordinary, passports, issued, to, citizens, by, national, governments, there, are, a, variety, of, other, types, of, passports, by, governments, in, specific, circumstances, while, individuals, are, typically, only, permitted, to, hold, one, passport, certain, governments, permit, citizens, to, hold, more, than, one, ordinary, passport, individuals, may, also, simultaneously, hold, an, ordinary, passport, and, an, official, or, diplomatic, passport, emergency, passports, also, called, temporary, passports, are, issued, to, persons, with, urgent, need, to, travel, who, do, not, have, passports, e, g, someone, abroad, whose,

visa, on, arrival, eta, or, evisa, issued, within, 3, days, as, of, 2023, the, strongest, passport, in, the, world, is, the, singaporean, passport, however, another, way, to, determine, passport, mobility, score, is, the, number, of, countries, it, allows, holders, to, live, and, work, in, for, example, by, this, measure, the, irish, passport, would, be, most, powerful, because, it, allows, the, holder, to, live, in, all, european, union, european, economic, area, countries, as, well, as, switzerland, and, the, united, kingdom, as, the, irish, passport, is, the, only, european, union,
