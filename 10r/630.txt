the, atacama, large, millimeter, submillimeter, array, alma, is, an, astronomical, interferometer, of, 66, radio, telescopes, in, the, atacama, desert, of, northern, chile, which, observe, electromagnetic, radiation, at, millimeter, and, submillimeter, wavelengths, the, array, has, been, constructed, on, the, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, elevation, chajnantor, plateau, near, the, llano, de, chajnantor, observatory, and, the, atacama, pathfinder, experiment, this, location, was, chosen, for, its, high, elevation, and, low, humidity, factors, which, are, crucial, to, reduce, noise, and, decrease, signal, attenuation, due, to, earth, s, atmosphere, alma, provides, insight, on, star, birth, during, the, early, stelliferous, era, and, detailed, imaging, of, local, star, and, planet, formation, alma, is, an, international, partnership, amongst, europe, the, united, states, canada, japan, south, korea, taiwan, and, chile, costing, about, us, 1, 4, billion, it, is, the, most, expensive, ground, based, telescope, in, operation, alma, began, scientific, observations, in, the, second, half, of, 2011, and, the, first, images, were, released, to, the, press, on, 3, october, 2011, the, array, has, been, fully, operational, since, march, 2013, the, initial, alma, array, is, composed, of, 66, high, precision, antennae, and, operates, at, wavelengths, of, 3, 6, to, 0, 32, millimeters, 31, to, 1000, ghz, the, array, has, much, higher, sensitivity, and, higher, resolution, than, earlier, submillimeter, telescopes, such, as, the, single, dish, james, clerk, maxwell, telescope, or, existing, interferometer, networks, such, as, the, submillimeter, array, or, the, institut, de, radio, astronomie, millim, trique, iram, plateau, de, bure, facility, the, antennae, can, be, moved, across, the, desert, plateau, over, distances, from, 150, m, to, 16, km, which, will, give, alma, a, powerful, variable, zoom, similar, in, its, concept, to, that, employed, at, the, centimeter, wavelength, very, large, array, vla, site, in, new, mexico, united, states, the, high, sensitivity, is, mainly, achieved, through, the, large, numbers, of, antenna, dishes, that, make, up, the, array, the, telescopes, were, provided, by, the, european, north, american, and, east, asian, partners, of, alma, the, american, and, european, partners, each, provided, twenty, five, 12, meter, diameter, antennae, for, a, subtotal, of, fifty, antennae, that, compose, the, main, array, the, participating, east, asian, countries, are, contributing, 16, antennae, four, 12, meter, diameter, and, twelve, 7, meter, diameter, antennae, in, the, form, of, the, atacama, compact, array, aca, which, is, part, of, the, enhanced, alma, by, using, smaller, antennae, than, the, main, alma, array, larger, fields, of, view, can, be, imaged, at, a, given, frequency, using, aca, placing, the, antennae, closer, together, enables, the, imaging, of, sources, of, larger, angular, extent, the, aca, works, together, with, the, main, array, in, order, to, enhance, the, latter, s, wide, field, imaging, capability, alma, has, its, conceptual, roots, in, three, astronomical, projects, the, millimeter, array, mma, of, the, united, states, the, large, southern, array, lsa, of, europe, and, the, large, millimeter, array, lma, of, japan, the, first, step, toward, the, creation, of, what, would, become, alma, came, in, 1997, when, the, national, radio, astronomy, observatory, nrao, and, the, european, southern, observatory, eso, agreed, to, pursue, a, common, project, that, merged, the, mma, and, lsa, the, merged, array, combined, the, sensitivity, of, the, lsa, with, the, frequency, coverage, and, superior, site, of, the, mma, eso, and, nrao, worked, together, in, technical, science, and, management, groups, to, define, and, organise, a, joint, project, between, the, two, observatories, with, participation, by, canada, and, spain, the, latter, became, a, member, of, eso, later, a, series, of, resolutions, and, agreements, led, to, the, choice, of, atacama, large, millimeter, array, or, alma, as, the, name, of, the, new, array, in, march, 1999, and, the, signing, of, the, alma, agreement, on, 25, february, 2003, between, the, north, american, and, european, parties, alma, means, soul, in, spanish, and, learned, or, knowledgeable, in, arabic, following, mutual, discussions, over, several, years, the, alma, project, received, a, proposal, from, the, national, astronomical, observatory, of, japan, naoj, whereby, japan, would, provide, the, aca, atacama, compact, array, and, three, additional, receiver, bands, for, the, large, array, to, form, enhanced, alma, further, discussions, between, alma, and, naoj, led, to, the, signing, of, a, high, level, agreement, on, 14, september, 2004, that, makes, japan, an, official, participant, in, enhanced, alma, to, be, known, as, the, atacama, large, millimeter, submillimeter, array, a, groundbreaking, ceremony, was, held, on, november, 6, 2003, and, the, alma, logo, was, unveiled, during, an, early, stage, of, the, planning, of, alma, it, was, decided, to, employ, alma, antennae, designed, and, constructed, by, known, companies, in, north, america, europe, and, japan, rather, than, using, one, single, design, this, was, mainly, for, political, reasons, although, very, different, approaches, have, been, chosen, by, the, providers, each, of, the, antenna, designs, appears, to, be, able, to, meet, alma, s, stringent, requirements, the, components, designed, and, manufactured, across, europe, were, transported, by, specialist, aerospace, and, astrospace, logistics, company, route, to, space, alliance, 26, in, total, which, were, delivered, to, antwerp, for, onward, shipment, to, chile, alma, was, initially, a, 50, 50, collaboration, between, the, national, radio, astronomy, observatory, and, european, southern, observatory, eso, and, later, extended, with, the, help, of, the, other, japanese, taiwanese, and, chilean, partners, alma, is, the, largest, and, most, expensive, ground, based, astronomical, project, costing, between, us, 1, 4, and, 1, 5, billion, however, various, space, astronomy, projects, including, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, james, webb, space, telescope, and, several, major, planet, probes, have, cost, considerably, more, the, complex, was, built, primarily, by, european, u, s, japanese, and, canadian, companies, and, universities, three, prototype, antennae, have, undergone, evaluation, at, the, very, large, array, since, 2002, general, dynamics, c4, systems, and, its, satcom, technologies, division, was, contracted, by, associated, universities, inc, to, provide, twenty, five, of, the, 12, m, antennae, while, european, manufacturer, thales, alenia, space, provided, the, other, twenty, five, principal, antennae, in, the, largest, ever, european, industrial, contract, in, ground, based, astronomy, japan, s, mitsubishi, electric, was, contracted, to, assemble, naoj, s, 16, antennae, the, antennae, were, delivered, to, the, site, from, december, 2008, to, september, 2013, transporting, the, 115, tonne, antennae, from, the, operations, support, facility, at, 2900, m, altitude, to, the, site, at, 5000, m, or, moving, antennae, around, the, site, to, change, the, array, size, presents, enormous, challenges, as, portrayed, in, the, television, documentary, monster, moves, mountain, mission, the, solution, chosen, is, to, use, two, custom, 28, wheel, self, loading, heavy, haulers, the, vehicles, were, made, by, scheuerle, fahrzeugfabrik, in, germany, and, are, 10, m, wide, 20, m, long, and, 6, m, high, weighing, 130, tonnes, they, are, powered, by, twin, turbocharged, 500, kw, diesel, engines, the, transporters, which, feature, a, driver, s, seat, designed, to, accommodate, an, oxygen, tank, to, aid, breathing, the, thin, high, altitude, air, place, the, antennae, precisely, on, the, pads, the, first, vehicle, was, completed, and, tested, in, july, 2007, both, transporters, were, delivered, to, the, alma, operations, support, facility, osf, in, chile, on, 15, february, 2008, on, 7, july, 2008, an, alma, transporter, moved, an, antenna, for, the, first, time, from, inside, the, antenna, assembly, building, site, erection, facility, to, a, pad, outside, the, building, for, testing, holographic, surface, measurements, during, autumn, 2009, the, first, three, antennae, were, transported, one, by, one, to, the, array, operations, site, at, the, end, of, 2009, a, team, of, alma, astronomers, and, engineers, successfully, linked, three, antennae, at, the, 5, 000, metre, 16, 000, ft, elevation, observing, site, thus, finishing, the, first, stage, of, assembly, and, integration, of, the, fledgling, array, linking, three, antennae, allows, corrections, of, errors, that, can, arise, when, only, two, antennae, are, used, thus, paving, the, way, for, precise, high, resolution, imaging, with, this, key, step, commissioning, of, the, instrument, began, 22, january, 2010, on, 28, july, 2011, the, first, european, antenna, for, alma, arrived, at, the, chajnantor, plateau, 5, 000, meters, above, sea, level, to, join, 15, antennae, already, in, place, from, the, other, international, partners, this, was, the, number, of, antennae, specified, for, alma, to, begin, its, first, science, observations, and, was, therefore, an, important, milestone, for, the, project, in, october, 2012, 43, of, the, 66, antennae, had, been, set, up, by, the, summer, of, 2011, sufficient, telescopes, were, operational, during, the, extensive, program, of, testing, prior, to, the, early, science, phase, for, the, first, images, to, be, captured, these, early, images, gave, a, first, glimpse, of, the, potential, of, the, new, array, that, will, produce, much, better, quality, images, in, the, future, as, the, scale, of, the, array, continues, to, increase, the, target, of, the, observation, was, a, pair, of, colliding, galaxies, with, dramatically, distorted, shapes, known, as, the, antennae, galaxies, although, alma, did, not, observe, the, entire, galaxy, merger, the, result, is, the, best, submillimeter, wavelength, image, ever, made, of, the, antennae, galaxies, showing, the, clouds, of, dense, cold, gas, from, which, new, stars, form, which, cannot, be, seen, using, visible, light, on, 11, august, 2014, astronomers, released, studies, using, the, atacama, large, millimeter, submillimeter, array, alma, for, the, first, time, that, detailed, the, distribution, of, hcn, hnc, h, 2, co, and, dust, inside, the, comae, of, comets, c, 2012, f6, lemmon, and, c, 2012, s1, ison, an, image, of, the, protoplanetary, disc, surrounding, hl, tauri, a, very, young, t, tauri, star, in, the, constellation, taurus, was, made, public, in, 2014, showing, a, series, of, concentric, bright, rings, separated, by, gaps, indicating, protoplanet, formation, as, of, 2014, most, theories, did, not, expect, planetary, formation, in, such, a, young, 100, 000, 1, 000, 000, year, old, system, so, the, new, data, spurred, renewed, theories, of, protoplanetary, development, one, theory, suggests, that, the, faster, accretion, rate, might, be, due, to, the, complex, magnetic, field, of, the, protoplanetary, disc, alma, participated, in, the, event, horizon, telescope, project, which, produced, the, first, direct, image, of, a, black, hole, published, in, 2019, alma, participated, in, the, claimed, detection, of, phosphine, a, biomarker, in, the, air, of, venus, as, no, known, non, biological, source, of, phosphine, on, venus, could, produce, phosphine, in, the, concentrations, detected, this, would, have, indicated, the, presence, of, biological, organisms, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, later, reanalyses, cast, doubt, on, the, detection, although, later, analyses, confirmed, the, results, the, detection, remains, controversial, and, is, awaiting, additional, measurements, the, atacama, large, millimeter, submillimeter, array, alma, an, international, astronomy, facility, is, a, partnership, of, europe, north, america, and, east, asia, in, cooperation, with, the, republic, of, chile, alma, is, funded, in, europe, by, the, european, southern, observatory, eso, in, north, america, by, the, u, s, national, science, foundation, nsf, in, cooperation, with, the, national, research, council, of, canada, nrc, and, the, national, science, council, of, taiwan, nsc, and, in, east, asia, by, the, national, institutes, of, natural, sciences, of, japan, nins, in, cooperation, with, the, academia, sinica, as, in, taiwan, alma, construction, and, operations, are, led, on, behalf, of, europe, by, eso, on, behalf, of, north, america, by, the, national, radio, astronomy, observatory, nrao, which, is, managed, by, associated, universities, inc, aui, and, on, behalf, of, east, asia, by, the, national, astronomical, observatory, of, japan, naoj, the, joint, alma, observatory, jao, provides, the, unified, leadership, and, management, of, the, construction, commissioning, and, operation, of, alma, its, current, director, since, february, 2018, is, sean, dougherty, the, alma, regional, centre, arc, has, been, designed, as, an, interface, between, user, communities, of, the, major, contributors, of, the, alma, project, and, the, jao, activates, for, operating, the, arc, have, also, divided, into, the, three, main, regions, involved, europe, north, america, and, east, asia, the, european, arc, led, by, eso, has, been, further, subdivided, into, arc, nodes, located, across, europe, in, bonn, bochum, cologne, bologna, ond, ejov, onsala, iram, grenoble, leiden, and, jbca, manchester, the, core, purpose, of, the, arc, is, to, assist, the, user, community, with, the, preparation, of, observing, proposals, ensure, observing, programs, meet, their, scientific, goals, efficiently, run, a, help, desk, for, submitting, proposals, and, observing, programs, delivering, the, data, to, principal, investigators, maintenance, of, the, alma, data, archive, assistance, with, the, calibration, of, data, and, providing, user, feedback, the, atacama, compact, array, aca, is, a, subset, of, 16, closely, separated, antennae, that, will, greatly, improve, alma, s, ability, to, study, celestial, objects, with, a, large, angular, size, such, as, molecular, clouds, and, nearby, galaxies, the, antennae, forming, the, atacama, compact, array, four, 12, meter, antennae, and, twelve, 7, meter, antennae, were, produced, and, delivered, by, japan, in, 2013, the, atacama, compact, array, was, named, the, morita, array, after, professor, koh, ichiro, morita, a, member, of, the, japanese, alma, team, and, designer, of, the, aca, who, died, on, 7, may, 2012, in, santiago, in, august, 2013, workers, at, the, telescope, went, on, strike, to, demand, better, pay, and, working, conditions, this, is, one, of, the, first, strikes, to, affect, an, astronomical, observatory, the, work, stoppage, began, after, the, observatory, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, with, the, workers, union, after, 17, days, an, agreement, was, reached, providing, for, reduced, schedules, and, higher, pay, for, work, done, at, high, altitude, in, march, 2020, alma, was, shut, down, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, it, also, delayed, the, cycle, 8, proposal, submission, deadline, and, suspended, public, visits, to, the, site, on, october, 29, 2022, alma, suspended, observations, due, to, a, cyber, attack, observations, were, restarted, 48, days, later, on, december, 16, 2022
