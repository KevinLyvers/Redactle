in, computing, a, file, system, or, filesystem, often, abbreviated, to, fs, or, fs, governs, file, organization, and, access, a, local, file, system, is, a, capability, of, an, operating, system, that, services, the, applications, running, on, the, same, computer, a, distributed, file, system, is, a, protocol, that, provides, file, access, between, networked, computers, a, file, system, provides, a, data, storage, service, that, allows, applications, to, share, mass, storage, without, a, file, system, applications, could, access, the, storage, in, incompatible, ways, that, lead, to, resource, contention, data, corruption, and, data, loss, there, are, many, file, system, designs, and, implementations, with, various, structure, and, features, and, various, resulting, characteristics, such, as, speed, flexibility, security, size, and, more, files, systems, have, been, developed, for, many, types, of, storage, devices, including, hard, disk, drives, hdds, solid, state, drives, ssds, magnetic, tapes, and, optical, discs, a, portion, of, the, computer, main, memory, can, be, set, up, as, a, ram, disk, that, serves, as, a, storage, device, for, a, file, system, file, systems, such, as, tmpfs, can, store, files, in, virtual, memory, a, virtual, file, system, provides, access, to, files, that, are, either, computed, on, request, called, virtual, files, see, procfs, and, sysfs, or, are, mapping, into, another, backing, storage, from, c, 1900, and, before, the, advent, of, computers, the, terms, file, system, filing, system, and, system, for, filing, were, used, to, describe, methods, of, organizing, storing, and, retrieving, paper, documents, by, 1961, the, term, file, system, was, being, applied, to, computerized, filing, alongside, the, original, meaning, by, 1964, it, was, in, general, use, a, local, file, system, s, architecture, can, be, described, as, layers, of, abstraction, even, though, a, particular, file, system, design, may, not, actually, separate, the, concepts, the, logical, file, system, layer, provides, relatively, high, level, access, via, an, application, programming, interface, api, for, file, operations, including, open, close, read, and, write, delegating, operations, to, lower, layers, this, layer, manages, open, file, table, entries, and, per, process, file, descriptors, it, provides, file, access, directory, operations, security, and, protection, the, virtual, file, system, an, optional, layer, supports, multiple, concurrent, instances, of, physical, file, systems, each, of, which, called, a, file, system, implementation, the, physical, file, system, layer, provides, relatively, low, level, access, to, a, storage, device, e, g, disk, it, reads, and, writes, data, blocks, provides, buffering, and, other, memory, management, and, controls, placement, of, blocks, in, specific, locations, on, the, storage, medium, this, layer, uses, device, drivers, or, channel, i, o, to, drive, the, storage, device, a, file, name, or, filename, identifies, a, file, to, consuming, applications, and, in, some, cases, users, a, file, name, is, unique, so, that, an, application, can, refer, to, exactly, one, file, for, a, particular, name, if, the, file, system, supports, directories, then, generally, file, name, uniqueness, is, enforced, within, the, context, of, each, directory, in, other, words, a, storage, can, contain, multiple, files, with, the, same, name, but, not, in, the, same, directory, most, file, systems, restrict, the, length, of, a, file, name, some, file, systems, match, file, names, as, case, sensitive, and, others, as, case, insensitive, for, example, the, names, myfile, and, myfile, match, the, same, file, for, case, insensitive, but, different, files, for, case, sensitive, most, modern, file, systems, allow, a, file, name, to, contain, a, wide, range, of, characters, from, the, unicode, character, set, some, restrict, characters, such, as, those, used, to, indicate, special, attributes, such, as, a, device, device, type, directory, prefix, file, path, separator, or, file, type, file, systems, typically, support, organizing, files, into, directories, also, called, folders, which, segregate, files, into, groups, this, may, be, implemented, by, associating, the, file, name, with, an, index, in, a, table, of, contents, or, an, inode, in, a, unix, like, file, system, directory, structures, may, be, flat, i, e, linear, or, allow, hierarchies, by, allowing, a, directory, to, contain, directories, called, subdirectories, the, first, file, system, to, support, arbitrary, hierarchies, of, directories, was, used, in, the, multics, operating, system, the, native, file, systems, of, unix, like, systems, also, support, arbitrary, directory, hierarchies, as, do, apple, s, hierarchical, file, system, and, its, successor, hfs, in, classic, mac, os, the, fat, file, system, in, ms, dos, 2, 0, and, later, versions, of, ms, dos, and, in, microsoft, windows, the, ntfs, file, system, in, the, windows, nt, family, of, operating, systems, and, the, ods, 2, on, disk, structure, 2, and, higher, levels, of, the, files, 11, file, system, in, openvms, in, addition, to, data, the, file, content, a, file, system, also, manages, associated, metadata, which, may, include, but, is, not, limited, to, a, file, system, stores, associated, metadata, separate, from, the, content, of, the, file, most, file, systems, store, the, names, of, all, the, files, in, one, directory, in, one, place, the, directory, table, for, that, directory, which, is, often, stored, like, any, other, file, many, file, systems, put, only, some, of, the, metadata, for, a, file, in, the, directory, table, and, the, rest, of, the, metadata, for, that, file, in, a, completely, separate, structure, such, as, the, inode, most, file, systems, also, store, metadata, not, associated, with, any, one, particular, file, such, metadata, includes, information, about, unused, regions, free, space, bitmap, block, availability, map, and, information, about, bad, sectors, often, such, information, about, an, allocation, group, is, stored, inside, the, allocation, group, itself, additional, attributes, can, be, associated, on, file, systems, such, as, ntfs, xfs, ext2, ext3, some, versions, of, ufs, and, hfs, using, extended, file, attributes, some, file, systems, provide, for, user, defined, attributes, such, as, the, author, of, the, document, the, character, encoding, of, a, document, or, the, size, of, an, image, some, file, systems, allow, for, different, data, collections, to, be, associated, with, one, file, name, these, separate, collections, may, be, referred, to, as, streams, or, forks, apple, has, long, used, a, forked, file, system, on, the, macintosh, and, microsoft, supports, streams, in, ntfs, some, file, systems, maintain, multiple, past, revisions, of, a, file, under, a, single, file, name, the, file, name, by, itself, retrieves, the, most, recent, version, while, prior, saved, version, can, be, accessed, using, a, special, naming, convention, such, as, filename, 4, or, filename, 4, to, access, the, version, four, saves, ago, see, comparison, of, file, systems, metadata, for, details, on, which, file, systems, support, which, kinds, of, metadata, a, local, file, system, tracks, which, areas, of, storage, belong, to, which, file, and, which, are, not, being, used, when, a, file, system, creates, a, file, it, allocates, space, for, data, some, file, systems, permit, or, require, specifying, an, initial, space, allocation, and, subsequent, incremental, allocations, as, the, file, grows, to, delete, a, file, the, file, system, records, that, the, file, s, space, is, free, available, to, use, for, another, file, a, local, file, system, manages, storage, space, to, provide, a, level, of, reliability, and, efficiency, generally, it, allocates, storage, device, space, in, a, granular, manner, usually, multiple, physical, units, i, e, bytes, for, example, in, apple, dos, of, the, early, 1980s, 256, byte, sectors, on, 140, kilobyte, floppy, disk, used, a, track, sector, map, the, granular, nature, results, in, unused, space, sometimes, called, slack, space, for, each, file, except, for, those, that, have, the, rare, size, that, is, a, multiple, of, the, granular, allocation, for, a, 512, byte, allocation, the, average, unused, space, is, 256, bytes, for, 64, kb, clusters, the, average, unused, space, is, 32, kb, generally, the, allocation, unit, size, is, set, when, the, storage, is, configured, choosing, a, relatively, small, size, compared, to, the, files, stored, results, in, excessive, access, overhead, choosing, a, relatively, large, size, results, in, excessive, unused, space, choosing, an, allocation, size, based, on, the, average, size, of, files, expected, to, be, in, the, storage, tends, to, minimize, unusable, space, as, a, file, system, creates, modifies, and, deletes, files, the, underlying, storage, representation, may, become, fragmented, files, and, the, unused, space, between, files, will, occupy, allocation, blocks, that, are, not, contiguous, a, file, becomes, fragmented, if, space, needed, to, store, its, content, cannot, be, allocated, in, contiguous, blocks, free, space, becomes, fragmented, when, files, are, deleted, this, is, invisible, to, the, end, user, and, the, system, still, works, correctly, however, this, can, degrade, performance, on, some, storage, hardware, that, work, better, with, contiguous, blocks, such, as, hard, disk, drives, other, hardware, such, as, solid, state, drives, are, not, affected, by, fragmentation, a, file, system, often, supports, access, control, of, data, that, it, manages, the, intent, of, access, control, is, often, to, prevent, certain, users, from, reading, or, modifying, certain, files, access, control, can, also, restrict, access, by, program, in, order, to, ensure, that, data, is, modified, in, a, controlled, way, examples, include, passwords, stored, in, the, metadata, of, the, file, or, elsewhere, and, file, permissions, in, the, form, of, permission, bits, access, control, lists, or, capabilities, the, need, for, file, system, utilities, to, be, able, to, access, the, data, at, the, media, level, to, reorganize, the, structures, and, provide, efficient, backup, usually, means, that, these, are, only, effective, for, polite, users, but, are, not, effective, against, intruders, methods, for, encrypting, file, data, are, sometimes, included, in, the, file, system, this, is, very, effective, since, there, is, no, need, for, file, system, utilities, to, know, the, encryption, seed, to, effectively, manage, the, data, the, risks, of, relying, on, encryption, include, the, fact, that, an, attacker, can, copy, the, data, and, use, brute, force, to, decrypt, the, data, additionally, losing, the, seed, means, losing, the, data, some, operating, systems, allow, a, system, administrator, to, enable, disk, quotas, to, limit, a, user, s, use, of, storage, space, a, file, system, typically, ensures, that, stored, data, remains, consistent, in, both, normal, operations, as, well, as, exceptional, situations, like, recovery, from, exceptional, situations, may, include, updating, metadata, directory, entries, and, handling, data, that, was, buffered, but, not, written, to, storage, media, a, file, system, might, record, events, to, allow, analysis, of, issues, such, as, many, file, systems, access, data, as, a, stream, of, bytes, typically, to, read, file, data, a, program, provides, a, memory, buffer, and, the, file, system, retrieves, data, from, the, medium, and, then, writes, the, data, to, the, buffer, a, write, involves, the, program, providing, a, buffer, of, bytes, that, the, file, system, reads, and, then, stores, to, the, medium, some, file, systems, or, layers, on, top, of, a, file, system, allow, a, program, to, define, a, record, so, that, a, program, can, read, and, write, data, as, a, structure, not, an, unorganized, sequence, of, bytes, if, a, fixed, length, record, definition, is, used, then, locating, the, n, th, record, can, be, calculated, mathematically, which, is, relatively, fast, compared, to, parsing, the, data, for, record, separators, an, identification, for, each, record, also, known, as, a, key, allows, a, program, to, read, write, and, update, records, without, regard, to, their, location, in, storage, such, storage, requires, managing, blocks, of, media, usually, separating, key, blocks, and, data, blocks, efficient, algorithms, can, be, developed, with, pyramid, structures, for, locating, records, typically, a, file, system, can, be, managed, by, the, user, via, various, utility, programs, some, utilities, allow, the, user, to, create, configure, and, remove, an, instance, of, a, file, system, it, may, allow, extending, or, truncating, the, space, allocated, to, the, file, system, directory, utilities, may, be, used, to, create, rename, and, delete, directory, entries, which, are, also, known, as, dentries, singular, dentry, and, to, alter, metadata, associated, with, a, directory, directory, utilities, may, also, include, capabilities, to, create, additional, links, to, a, directory, hard, links, in, unix, to, rename, parent, links, in, unix, like, operating, systems, and, to, create, bidirectional, links, to, files, file, utilities, create, list, copy, move, and, delete, files, and, alter, metadata, they, may, be, able, to, truncate, data, truncate, or, extend, space, allocation, append, to, move, and, modify, files, in, place, depending, on, the, underlying, structure, of, the, file, system, they, may, provide, a, mechanism, to, prepend, to, or, truncate, from, the, beginning, of, a, file, insert, entries, into, the, middle, of, a, file, or, delete, entries, from, a, file, utilities, to, free, space, for, deleted, files, if, the, file, system, provides, an, undelete, function, also, belong, to, this, category, some, file, systems, defer, operations, such, as, reorganization, of, free, space, secure, erasing, of, free, space, and, rebuilding, of, hierarchical, structures, by, providing, utilities, to, perform, these, functions, at, times, of, minimal, activity, an, example, is, the, file, system, defragmentation, utilities, some, of, the, most, important, features, of, file, system, utilities, are, supervisory, activities, which, may, involve, bypassing, ownership, or, direct, access, to, the, underlying, device, these, include, high, performance, backup, and, recovery, data, replication, and, reorganization, of, various, data, structures, and, allocation, tables, within, the, file, system, utilities, libraries, and, programs, use, file, system, apis, to, make, requests, of, the, file, system, these, include, data, transfer, positioning, updating, metadata, managing, directories, managing, access, specifications, and, removal, frequently, retail, systems, are, configured, with, a, single, file, system, occupying, the, entire, storage, device, another, approach, is, to, partition, the, disk, so, that, several, file, systems, with, different, attributes, can, be, used, one, file, system, for, use, as, browser, cache, or, email, storage, might, be, configured, with, a, small, allocation, size, this, keeps, the, activity, of, creating, and, deleting, files, typical, of, browser, activity, in, a, narrow, area, of, the, disk, where, it, will, not, interfere, with, other, file, allocations, another, partition, might, be, created, for, the, storage, of, audio, or, video, files, with, a, relatively, large, block, size, yet, another, may, normally, be, set, read, only, and, only, periodically, be, set, writable, some, file, systems, such, as, zfs, and, apfs, support, multiple, file, systems, sharing, a, common, pool, of, free, blocks, supporting, several, file, systems, with, different, attributes, without, having, to, reserved, a, fixed, amount, of, space, for, each, file, system, a, third, approach, which, is, mostly, used, in, cloud, systems, is, to, use, disk, images, to, house, additional, file, systems, with, the, same, attributes, or, not, within, another, host, file, system, as, a, file, a, common, example, is, virtualization, one, user, can, run, an, experimental, linux, distribution, using, the, ext4, file, system, in, a, virtual, machine, under, his, her, production, windows, environment, using, ntfs, the, ext4, file, system, resides, in, a, disk, image, which, is, treated, as, a, file, or, multiple, files, depending, on, the, hypervisor, and, settings, in, the, ntfs, host, file, system, having, multiple, file, systems, on, a, single, system, has, the, additional, benefit, that, in, the, event, of, a, corruption, of, a, single, file, system, the, remaining, file, systems, will, frequently, still, be, intact, this, includes, virus, destruction, of, the, system, file, system, or, even, a, system, that, will, not, boot, file, system, utilities, which, require, dedicated, access, can, be, effectively, completed, piecemeal, in, addition, defragmentation, may, be, more, effective, several, system, maintenance, utilities, such, as, virus, scans, and, backups, can, also, be, processed, in, segments, for, example, it, is, not, necessary, to, backup, the, file, system, containing, videos, along, with, all, the, other, files, if, none, have, been, added, since, the, last, backup, as, for, the, image, files, one, can, easily, spin, off, differential, images, which, contain, only, new, data, written, to, the, master, original, image, differential, images, can, be, used, for, both, safety, concerns, as, a, disposable, system, can, be, quickly, restored, if, destroyed, or, contaminated, by, a, virus, as, the, old, image, can, be, removed, and, a, new, image, can, be, created, in, matter, of, seconds, even, without, automated, procedures, and, quick, virtual, machine, deployment, since, the, differential, images, can, be, quickly, spawned, using, a, script, in, batches, a, disk, file, system, takes, advantages, of, the, ability, of, disk, storage, media, to, randomly, address, data, in, a, short, amount, of, time, additional, considerations, include, the, speed, of, accessing, data, following, that, initially, requested, and, the, anticipation, that, the, following, data, may, also, be, requested, this, permits, multiple, users, or, processes, access, to, various, data, on, the, disk, without, regard, to, the, sequential, location, of, the, data, examples, include, fat, fat12, fat16, fat32, exfat, ntfs, refs, hfs, and, hfs, hpfs, apfs, ufs, ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, files, 11, veritas, file, system, vmfs, zfs, reiserfs, nss, and, scoutfs, some, disk, file, systems, are, journaling, file, systems, or, versioning, file, systems, iso, 9660, and, universal, disk, format, udf, are, two, common, formats, that, target, compact, discs, dvds, and, blu, ray, discs, mount, rainier, is, an, extension, to, udf, supported, since, 2, 6, series, of, the, linux, kernel, and, since, windows, vista, that, facilitates, rewriting, to, dvds, a, flash, file, system, considers, the, special, abilities, performance, and, restrictions, of, flash, memory, devices, frequently, a, disk, file, system, can, use, a, flash, memory, device, as, the, underlying, storage, media, but, it, is, much, better, to, use, a, file, system, specifically, designed, for, a, flash, device, a, tape, file, system, is, a, file, system, and, tape, format, designed, to, store, files, on, tape, magnetic, tapes, are, sequential, storage, media, with, significantly, longer, random, data, access, times, than, disks, posing, challenges, to, the, creation, and, efficient, management, of, a, general, purpose, file, system, in, a, disk, file, system, there, is, typically, a, master, file, directory, and, a, map, of, used, and, free, data, regions, any, file, additions, changes, or, removals, require, updating, the, directory, and, the, used, free, maps, random, access, to, data, regions, is, measured, in, milliseconds, so, this, system, works, well, for, disks, tape, requires, linear, motion, to, wind, and, unwind, potentially, very, long, reels, of, media, this, tape, motion, may, take, several, seconds, to, several, minutes, to, move, the, read, write, head, from, one, end, of, the, tape, to, the, other, consequently, a, master, file, directory, and, usage, map, can, be, extremely, slow, and, inefficient, with, tape, writing, typically, involves, reading, the, block, usage, map, to, find, free, blocks, for, writing, updating, the, usage, map, and, directory, to, add, the, data, and, then, advancing, the, tape, to, write, the, data, in, the, correct, spot, each, additional, file, write, requires, updating, the, map, and, directory, and, writing, the, data, which, may, take, several, seconds, to, occur, for, each, file, tape, file, systems, instead, typically, allow, for, the, file, directory, to, be, spread, across, the, tape, intermixed, with, the, data, referred, to, as, streaming, so, that, time, consuming, and, repeated, tape, motions, are, not, required, to, write, new, data, however, a, side, effect, of, this, design, is, that, reading, the, file, directory, of, a, tape, usually, requires, scanning, the, entire, tape, to, read, all, the, scattered, directory, entries, most, data, archiving, software, that, works, with, tape, storage, will, store, a, local, copy, of, the, tape, catalog, on, a, disk, file, system, so, that, adding, files, to, a, tape, can, be, done, quickly, without, having, to, rescan, the, tape, media, the, local, tape, catalog, copy, is, usually, discarded, if, not, used, for, a, specified, period, of, time, at, which, point, the, tape, must, be, re, scanned, if, it, is, to, be, used, in, the, future, ibm, has, developed, a, file, system, for, tape, called, the, linear, tape, file, system, the, ibm, implementation, of, this, file, system, has, been, released, as, the, open, source, ibm, linear, tape, file, system, single, drive, edition, ltfs, sde, product, the, linear, tape, file, system, uses, a, separate, partition, on, the, tape, to, record, the, index, meta, data, thereby, avoiding, the, problems, associated, with, scattering, directory, entries, across, the, entire, tape, writing, data, to, a, tape, erasing, or, formatting, a, tape, is, often, a, significantly, time, consuming, process, and, can, take, several, hours, on, large, tapes, with, many, data, tape, technologies, it, is, not, necessary, to, format, the, tape, before, over, writing, new, data, to, the, tape, this, is, due, to, the, inherently, destructive, nature, of, overwriting, data, on, sequential, media, because, of, the, time, it, can, take, to, format, a, tape, typically, tapes, are, pre, formatted, so, that, the, tape, user, does, not, need, to, spend, time, preparing, each, new, tape, for, use, all, that, is, usually, necessary, is, to, write, an, identifying, media, label, to, the, tape, before, use, and, even, this, can, be, automatically, written, by, software, when, a, new, tape, is, used, for, the, first, time, another, concept, for, file, management, is, the, idea, of, a, database, based, file, system, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, hierarchical, structured, management, files, are, identified, by, their, characteristics, like, type, of, file, topic, author, or, similar, rich, metadata, ibm, db2, for, i, formerly, known, as, db2, 400, and, db2, for, i5, os, is, a, database, file, system, as, part, of, the, object, based, ibm, i, operating, system, formerly, known, as, os, 400, and, i5, os, incorporating, a, single, level, store, and, running, on, ibm, power, systems, formerly, known, as, as, 400, and, iseries, designed, by, frank, g, soltis, ibm, s, former, chief, scientist, for, ibm, i, around, 1978, to, 1988, frank, g, soltis, and, his, team, at, ibm, rochester, had, successfully, designed, and, applied, technologies, like, the, database, file, system, where, others, like, microsoft, later, failed, to, accomplish, these, technologies, are, informally, known, as, fortress, rochester, and, were, in, few, basic, aspects, extended, from, early, mainframe, technologies, but, in, many, ways, more, advanced, from, a, technological, perspective, some, other, projects, that, are, not, pure, database, file, systems, but, that, use, some, aspects, of, a, database, file, system, some, programs, need, to, either, make, multiple, file, system, changes, or, if, one, or, more, of, the, changes, fail, for, any, reason, make, none, of, the, changes, for, example, a, program, which, is, installing, or, updating, software, may, write, executables, libraries, and, or, configuration, files, if, some, of, the, writing, fails, and, the, software, is, left, partially, installed, or, updated, the, software, may, be, broken, or, unusable, an, incomplete, update, of, a, key, system, utility, such, as, the, command, shell, may, leave, the, entire, system, in, an, unusable, state, transaction, processing, introduces, the, atomicity, guarantee, ensuring, that, operations, inside, of, a, transaction, are, either, all, committed, or, the, transaction, can, be, aborted, and, the, system, discards, all, of, its, partial, results, this, means, that, if, there, is, a, crash, or, power, failure, after, recovery, the, stored, state, will, be, consistent, either, the, software, will, be, completely, installed, or, the, failed, installation, will, be, completely, rolled, back, but, an, unusable, partial, install, will, not, be, left, on, the, system, transactions, also, provide, the, isolation, guarantee, meaning, that, operations, within, a, transaction, are, hidden, from, other, threads, on, the, system, until, the, transaction, commits, and, that, interfering, operations, on, the, system, will, be, properly, serialized, with, the, transaction, windows, beginning, with, vista, added, transaction, support, to, ntfs, in, a, feature, called, transactional, ntfs, but, its, use, is, now, discouraged, there, are, a, number, of, research, prototypes, of, transactional, file, systems, for, unix, systems, including, the, valor, file, system, amino, lfs, and, a, transactional, ext3, file, system, on, the, txos, kernel, as, well, as, transactional, file, systems, targeting, embedded, systems, such, as, tffs, ensuring, consistency, across, multiple, file, system, operations, is, difficult, if, not, impossible, without, file, system, transactions, file, locking, can, be, used, as, a, concurrency, control, mechanism, for, individual, files, but, it, typically, does, not, protect, the, directory, structure, or, file, metadata, for, instance, file, locking, cannot, prevent, tocttou, race, conditions, on, symbolic, links, file, locking, also, cannot, automatically, roll, back, a, failed, operation, such, as, a, software, upgrade, this, requires, atomicity, journaling, file, systems, is, one, technique, used, to, introduce, transaction, level, consistency, to, file, system, structures, journal, transactions, are, not, exposed, to, programs, as, part, of, the, os, api, they, are, only, used, internally, to, ensure, consistency, at, the, granularity, of, a, single, system, call, data, backup, systems, typically, do, not, provide, support, for, direct, backup, of, data, stored, in, a, transactional, manner, which, makes, the, recovery, of, reliable, and, consistent, data, sets, difficult, most, backup, software, simply, notes, what, files, have, changed, since, a, certain, time, regardless, of, the, transactional, state, shared, across, multiple, files, in, the, overall, dataset, as, a, workaround, some, database, systems, simply, produce, an, archived, state, file, containing, all, data, up, to, that, point, and, the, backup, software, only, backs, that, up, and, does, not, interact, directly, with, the, active, transactional, databases, at, all, recovery, requires, separate, recreation, of, the, database, from, the, state, file, after, the, file, has, been, restored, by, the, backup, software, a, network, file, system, is, a, file, system, that, acts, as, a, client, for, a, remote, file, access, protocol, providing, access, to, files, on, a, server, programs, using, local, interfaces, can, transparently, create, manage, and, access, hierarchical, directories, and, files, in, remote, network, connected, computers, examples, of, network, file, systems, include, clients, for, the, nfs, afs, smb, protocols, and, file, system, like, clients, for, ftp, and, webdav, a, shared, disk, file, system, is, one, in, which, a, number, of, machines, usually, servers, all, have, access, to, the, same, external, disk, subsystem, usually, a, storage, area, network, the, file, system, arbitrates, access, to, that, subsystem, preventing, write, collisions, examples, include, gfs2, from, red, hat, gpfs, now, known, as, spectrum, scale, from, ibm, sfs, from, dataplow, cxfs, from, sgi, stornext, from, quantum, corporation, and, scoutfs, from, versity, some, file, systems, expose, elements, of, the, operating, system, as, files, so, they, can, be, acted, on, via, the, file, system, api, this, is, common, in, unix, like, operating, systems, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, other, operating, systems, examples, include, in, the, 1970s, disk, and, digital, tape, devices, were, too, expensive, for, some, early, microcomputer, users, an, inexpensive, basic, data, storage, system, was, devised, that, used, common, audio, cassette, tape, when, the, system, needed, to, write, data, the, user, was, notified, to, press, record, on, the, cassette, recorder, then, press, return, on, the, keyboard, to, notify, the, system, that, the, cassette, recorder, was, recording, the, system, wrote, a, sound, to, provide, time, synchronization, then, modulated, sounds, that, encoded, a, prefix, the, data, a, checksum, and, a, suffix, when, the, system, needed, to, read, data, the, user, was, instructed, to, press, play, on, the, cassette, recorder, the, system, would, listen, to, the, sounds, on, the, tape, waiting, until, a, burst, of, sound, could, be, recognized, as, the, synchronization, the, system, would, then, interpret, subsequent, sounds, as, data, when, the, data, read, was, complete, the, system, would, notify, the, user, to, press, stop, on, the, cassette, recorder, it, was, primitive, but, it, mostly, worked, data, was, stored, sequentially, usually, in, an, unnamed, format, although, some, systems, such, as, the, commodore, pet, series, of, computers, did, allow, the, files, to, be, named, multiple, sets, of, data, could, be, written, and, located, by, fast, forwarding, the, tape, and, observing, at, the, tape, counter, to, find, the, approximate, start, of, the, next, data, region, on, the, tape, the, user, might, have, to, listen, to, the, sounds, to, find, the, right, spot, to, begin, playing, the, next, data, region, some, implementations, even, included, audible, sounds, interspersed, with, the, data, in, a, flat, file, system, there, are, no, subdirectories, directory, entries, for, all, files, are, stored, in, a, single, directory, when, floppy, disk, media, was, first, available, this, type, of, file, system, was, adequate, due, to, the, relatively, small, amount, of, data, space, available, cp, m, machines, featured, a, flat, file, system, where, files, could, be, assigned, to, one, of, 16, user, areas, and, generic, file, operations, narrowed, to, work, on, one, instead, of, defaulting, to, work, on, all, of, them, these, user, areas, were, no, more, than, special, attributes, associated, with, the, files, that, is, it, was, not, necessary, to, define, specific, quota, for, each, of, these, areas, and, files, could, be, added, to, groups, for, as, long, as, there, was, still, free, storage, space, on, the, disk, the, early, apple, macintosh, also, featured, a, flat, file, system, the, macintosh, file, system, it, was, unusual, in, that, the, file, management, program, macintosh, finder, created, the, illusion, of, a, partially, hierarchical, filing, system, on, top, of, emfs, this, structure, required, every, file, to, have, a, unique, name, even, if, it, appeared, to, be, in, a, separate, folder, ibm, dos, 360, and, os, 360, store, entries, for, all, files, on, a, disk, pack, volume, in, a, directory, on, the, pack, called, a, volume, table, of, contents, vtoc, while, simple, flat, file, systems, become, awkward, as, the, number, of, files, grows, and, makes, it, difficult, to, organize, data, into, related, groups, of, files, a, recent, addition, to, the, flat, file, system, family, is, amazon, s, s3, a, remote, storage, service, which, is, intentionally, simplistic, to, allow, users, the, ability, to, customize, how, their, data, is, stored, the, only, constructs, are, buckets, imagine, a, disk, drive, of, unlimited, size, and, objects, similar, but, not, identical, to, the, standard, concept, of, a, file, advanced, file, management, is, allowed, by, being, able, to, use, nearly, any, character, including, in, the, object, s, name, and, the, ability, to, select, subsets, of, the, bucket, s, content, based, on, identical, prefixes, an, operating, system, os, typically, supports, one, or, more, file, systems, sometimes, an, os, and, its, file, system, are, so, tightly, interwoven, that, it, is, difficult, to, describe, them, independently, an, os, typically, provides, file, system, access, to, the, user, often, an, os, provides, command, line, interface, such, as, unix, shell, windows, command, prompt, and, powershell, and, openvms, dcl, an, os, often, also, provides, graphical, user, interface, file, browsers, such, as, macos, finder, and, windows, file, explorer, unix, like, operating, systems, create, a, virtual, file, system, which, makes, all, the, files, on, all, the, devices, appear, to, exist, in, a, single, hierarchy, this, means, in, those, systems, there, is, one, root, directory, and, every, file, existing, on, the, system, is, located, under, it, somewhere, unix, like, systems, can, use, a, ram, disk, or, network, shared, resource, as, its, root, directory, unix, like, systems, assign, a, device, name, to, each, device, but, this, is, not, how, the, files, on, that, device, are, accessed, instead, to, gain, access, to, files, on, another, device, the, operating, system, must, first, be, informed, where, in, the, directory, tree, those, files, should, appear, this, process, is, called, mounting, a, file, system, for, example, to, access, the, files, on, a, cd, rom, one, must, tell, the, operating, system, take, the, file, system, from, this, cd, rom, and, make, it, appear, under, such, and, such, directory, the, directory, given, to, the, operating, system, is, called, the, mount, point, it, might, for, example, be, media, the, media, directory, exists, on, many, unix, systems, as, specified, in, the, filesystem, hierarchy, standard, and, is, intended, specifically, for, use, as, a, mount, point, for, removable, media, such, as, cds, dvds, usb, drives, or, floppy, disks, it, may, be, empty, or, it, may, contain, subdirectories, for, mounting, individual, devices, generally, only, the, administrator, i, e, root, user, may, authorize, the, mounting, of, file, systems, unix, like, operating, systems, often, include, software, and, tools, that, assist, in, the, mounting, process, and, provide, it, new, functionality, some, of, these, strategies, have, been, coined, auto, mounting, as, a, reflection, of, their, purpose, linux, supports, numerous, file, systems, but, common, choices, for, the, system, disk, on, a, block, device, include, the, ext, family, ext2, ext3, and, ext4, xfs, jfs, and, btrfs, for, raw, flash, without, a, flash, translation, layer, ftl, or, memory, technology, device, mtd, there, are, ubifs, jffs2, and, yaffs, among, others, squashfs, is, a, common, compressed, read, only, file, system, solaris, in, earlier, releases, defaulted, to, non, journaled, or, non, logging, ufs, for, bootable, and, supplementary, file, systems, solaris, defaulted, to, supported, and, extended, ufs, support, for, other, file, systems, and, significant, enhancements, were, added, over, time, including, veritas, software, corp, journaling, vxfs, sun, microsystems, clustering, qfs, sun, microsystems, journaling, ufs, and, sun, microsystems, open, source, poolable, 128, bit, compressible, and, error, correcting, zfs, kernel, extensions, were, added, to, solaris, to, allow, for, bootable, veritas, vxfs, operation, logging, or, journaling, was, added, to, ufs, in, sun, s, solaris, 7, releases, of, solaris, 10, solaris, express, opensolaris, and, other, open, source, variants, of, the, solaris, operating, system, later, supported, bootable, zfs, logical, volume, management, allows, for, spanning, a, file, system, across, multiple, devices, for, the, purpose, of, adding, redundancy, capacity, and, or, throughput, legacy, environments, in, solaris, may, use, solaris, volume, manager, formerly, known, as, solstice, disksuite, multiple, operating, systems, including, solaris, may, use, veritas, volume, manager, modern, solaris, based, operating, systems, eclipse, the, need, for, volume, management, through, leveraging, virtual, storage, pools, in, zfs, macos, formerly, mac, os, x, uses, the, apple, file, system, apfs, which, in, 2017, replaced, a, file, system, inherited, from, classic, mac, os, called, hfs, plus, hfs, apple, also, uses, the, term, mac, os, extended, for, hfs, hfs, plus, is, a, metadata, rich, and, case, preserving, but, usually, case, insensitive, file, system, due, to, the, unix, roots, of, macos, unix, permissions, were, added, to, hfs, plus, later, versions, of, hfs, plus, added, journaling, to, prevent, corruption, of, the, file, system, structure, and, introduced, a, number, of, optimizations, to, the, allocation, algorithms, in, an, attempt, to, defragment, files, automatically, without, requiring, an, external, defragmenter, file, names, can, be, up, to, 255, characters, hfs, plus, uses, unicode, to, store, file, names, on, macos, the, filetype, can, come, from, the, type, code, stored, in, file, s, metadata, or, the, filename, extension, hfs, plus, has, three, kinds, of, links, unix, style, hard, links, unix, style, symbolic, links, and, aliases, aliases, are, designed, to, maintain, a, link, to, their, original, file, even, if, they, are, moved, or, renamed, they, are, not, interpreted, by, the, file, system, itself, but, by, the, file, manager, code, in, userland, macos, 10, 13, high, sierra, which, was, announced, on, june, 5, 2017, at, apple, s, wwdc, event, uses, the, apple, file, system, on, solid, state, drives, macos, also, supported, the, ufs, file, system, derived, from, the, bsd, unix, fast, file, system, via, nextstep, however, as, of, mac, os, x, leopard, macos, could, no, longer, be, installed, on, a, ufs, volume, nor, can, a, pre, leopard, system, installed, on, a, ufs, volume, be, upgraded, to, leopard, as, of, mac, os, x, lion, ufs, support, was, completely, dropped, newer, versions, of, macos, are, capable, of, reading, and, writing, to, the, legacy, fat, file, systems, 16, and, 32, common, on, windows, they, are, also, capable, of, reading, the, newer, ntfs, file, systems, for, windows, in, order, to, write, to, ntfs, file, systems, on, macos, versions, prior, to, mac, os, x, snow, leopard, third, party, software, is, necessary, mac, os, x, 10, 6, snow, leopard, and, later, allow, writing, to, ntfs, file, systems, but, only, after, a, non, trivial, system, setting, change, third, party, software, exists, that, automates, this, finally, macos, supports, reading, and, writing, of, the, exfat, file, system, since, mac, os, x, snow, leopard, starting, from, version, 10, 6, 5, os, 2, 1, 2, introduced, the, high, performance, file, system, hpfs, hpfs, supports, mixed, case, file, names, in, different, code, pages, long, file, names, 255, characters, more, efficient, use, of, disk, space, an, architecture, that, keeps, related, items, close, to, each, other, on, the, disk, volume, less, fragmentation, of, data, extent, based, space, allocation, a, b, tree, structure, for, directories, and, the, root, directory, located, at, the, midpoint, of, the, disk, for, faster, average, access, a, journaled, filesystem, jfs, was, shipped, in, 1999, pc, bsd, is, a, desktop, version, of, freebsd, which, inherits, freebsd, s, zfs, support, similarly, to, freenas, the, new, graphical, installer, of, pc, bsd, can, handle, root, on, zfs, and, raid, z, pool, installs, and, disk, encryption, using, geli, right, from, the, start, in, an, easy, convenient, gui, way, the, current, pc, bsd, 9, 0, isotope, edition, has, zfs, filesystem, version, 5, and, zfs, storage, pool, version, 28, plan, 9, from, bell, labs, treats, everything, as, a, file, and, accesses, all, objects, as, a, file, would, be, accessed, i, e, there, is, no, ioctl, or, mmap, networking, graphics, debugging, authentication, capabilities, encryption, and, other, services, are, accessed, via, i, o, operations, on, file, descriptors, the, 9p, protocol, removes, the, difference, between, local, and, remote, files, file, systems, in, plan, 9, are, organized, with, the, help, of, private, per, process, namespaces, allowing, each, process, to, have, a, different, view, of, the, many, file, systems, that, provide, resources, in, a, distributed, system, the, inferno, operating, system, shares, these, concepts, with, plan, 9, windows, makes, use, of, the, fat, ntfs, exfat, live, file, system, and, refs, file, systems, the, last, of, these, is, only, supported, and, usable, in, windows, server, 2012, windows, server, 2016, windows, 8, windows, 8, 1, and, windows, 10, windows, cannot, boot, from, it, windows, uses, a, drive, letter, abstraction, at, the, user, level, to, distinguish, one, disk, or, partition, from, another, for, example, the, path, c, windows, represents, a, directory, windows, on, the, partition, represented, by, the, letter, c, drive, c, is, most, commonly, used, for, the, primary, hard, disk, drive, partition, on, which, windows, is, usually, installed, and, from, which, it, boots, this, tradition, has, become, so, firmly, ingrained, that, bugs, exist, in, many, applications, which, make, assumptions, that, the, drive, that, the, operating, system, is, installed, on, is, c, the, use, of, drive, letters, and, the, tradition, of, using, c, as, the, drive, letter, for, the, primary, hard, disk, drive, partition, can, be, traced, to, ms, dos, where, the, letters, a, and, b, were, reserved, for, up, to, two, floppy, disk, drives, this, in, turn, derived, from, cp, m, in, the, 1970s, and, ultimately, from, ibm, s, cp, cms, of, 1967, the, family, of, fat, file, systems, is, supported, by, almost, all, operating, systems, for, personal, computers, including, all, versions, of, windows, and, ms, dos, pc, dos, os, 2, and, dr, dos, pc, dos, is, an, oem, version, of, ms, dos, ms, dos, was, originally, based, on, scp, s, 86, dos, dr, dos, was, based, on, digital, research, s, concurrent, dos, a, successor, of, cp, m, 86, the, fat, file, systems, are, therefore, well, suited, as, a, universal, exchange, format, between, computers, and, devices, of, most, any, type, and, age, the, fat, file, system, traces, its, roots, back, to, an, incompatible, 8, bit, fat, precursor, in, standalone, disk, basic, and, the, short, lived, mdos, midas, project, over, the, years, the, file, system, has, been, expanded, from, fat12, to, fat16, and, fat32, various, features, have, been, added, to, the, file, system, including, subdirectories, codepage, support, extended, attributes, and, long, filenames, third, parties, such, as, digital, research, have, incorporated, optional, support, for, deletion, tracking, and, volume, directory, file, based, multi, user, security, schemes, to, support, file, and, directory, passwords, and, permissions, such, as, read, write, execute, delete, access, rights, most, of, these, extensions, are, not, supported, by, windows, the, fat12, and, fat16, file, systems, had, a, limit, on, the, number, of, entries, in, the, root, directory, of, the, file, system, and, had, restrictions, on, the, maximum, size, of, fat, formatted, disks, or, partitions, fat32, addresses, the, limitations, in, fat12, and, fat16, except, for, the, file, size, limit, of, close, to, 4, gb, but, it, remains, limited, compared, to, ntfs, fat12, fat16, and, fat32, also, have, a, limit, of, eight, characters, for, the, file, name, and, three, characters, for, the, extension, such, as, exe, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, 8, 3, filename, limit, vfat, an, optional, extension, to, fat12, fat16, and, fat32, introduced, in, windows, 95, and, windows, nt, 3, 5, allowed, long, file, names, lfn, to, be, stored, in, the, fat, file, system, in, a, backwards, compatible, fashion, ntfs, introduced, with, the, windows, nt, operating, system, in, 1993, allowed, acl, based, permission, control, other, features, also, supported, by, ntfs, include, hard, links, multiple, file, streams, attribute, indexing, quota, tracking, sparse, files, encryption, compression, and, reparse, points, directories, working, as, mount, points, for, other, file, systems, symlinks, junctions, remote, storage, links, exfat, has, certain, advantages, over, ntfs, with, regard, to, file, system, overhead, exfat, is, not, backward, compatible, with, fat, file, systems, such, as, fat12, fat16, or, fat32, the, file, system, is, supported, with, newer, windows, systems, such, as, windows, xp, windows, server, 2003, windows, vista, windows, 2008, windows, 7, windows, 8, windows, 8, 1, windows, 10, and, windows, 11, exfat, is, supported, in, macos, starting, with, version, 10, 6, 5, snow, leopard, support, in, other, operating, systems, is, sparse, since, implementing, support, for, exfat, requires, a, license, exfat, is, the, only, file, system, that, is, fully, supported, on, both, macos, and, windows, that, can, hold, files, larger, than, 4, gb, prior, to, the, introduction, of, vsam, os, 360, systems, implemented, a, hybrid, file, system, the, system, was, designed, to, easily, support, removable, disk, packs, so, the, information, relating, to, all, files, on, one, disk, volume, in, ibm, terminology, is, stored, on, that, disk, in, a, flat, system, file, called, the, volume, table, of, contents, vtoc, the, vtoc, stores, all, metadata, for, the, file, later, a, hierarchical, directory, structure, was, imposed, with, the, introduction, of, the, system, catalog, which, can, optionally, catalog, files, datasets, on, resident, and, removable, volumes, the, catalog, only, contains, information, to, relate, a, dataset, to, a, specific, volume, if, the, user, requests, access, to, a, dataset, on, an, offline, volume, and, they, have, suitable, privileges, the, system, will, attempt, to, mount, the, required, volume, cataloged, and, non, cataloged, datasets, can, still, be, accessed, using, information, in, the, vtoc, bypassing, the, catalog, if, the, required, volume, id, is, provided, to, the, open, request, still, later, the, vtoc, was, indexed, to, speed, up, access, the, ibm, conversational, monitor, system, cms, component, of, vm, 370, uses, a, separate, flat, file, system, for, each, virtual, disk, minidisk, file, data, and, control, information, are, scattered, and, intermixed, the, anchor, is, a, record, called, the, master, file, directory, mfd, always, located, in, the, fourth, block, on, the, disk, originally, cms, used, fixed, length, 800, byte, blocks, but, later, versions, used, larger, size, blocks, up, to, 4k, access, to, a, data, record, requires, two, levels, of, indirection, where, the, file, s, directory, entry, called, a, file, status, table, fst, entry, points, to, blocks, containing, a, list, of, addresses, of, the, individual, records, data, on, the, as, 400, and, its, successors, consists, of, system, objects, mapped, into, the, system, virtual, address, space, in, a, single, level, store, many, types, of, objects, are, defined, including, the, directories, and, files, found, in, other, file, systems, file, objects, along, with, other, types, of, objects, form, the, basis, of, the, as, 400, s, support, for, an, integrated, relational, database, file, systems, limit, storable, data, capacity, generally, driven, by, the, typical, size, of, storage, devices, at, the, time, the, file, system, is, designed, and, anticipated, into, the, foreseeable, future, since, storage, sizes, have, increased, at, near, exponential, rate, see, moore, s, law, newer, storage, devices, often, exceed, existing, file, system, limits, within, only, a, few, years, after, introduction, this, requires, new, file, systems, with, ever, increasing, capacity, with, higher, capacity, the, need, for, capabilities, and, therefore, complexity, increases, as, well, file, system, complexity, typically, varies, proportionally, with, available, storage, capacity, capacity, issues, aside, the, file, systems, of, early, 1980s, home, computers, with, 50, kb, to, 512, kb, of, storage, would, not, be, a, reasonable, choice, for, modern, storage, systems, with, hundreds, of, gigabytes, of, capacity, likewise, modern, file, systems, would, not, be, a, reasonable, choice, for, these, early, systems, since, the, complexity, of, modern, file, system, structures, would, quickly, consume, the, limited, capacity, of, early, storage, systems, it, may, be, advantageous, or, necessary, to, have, files, in, a, different, file, system, than, they, currently, exist, reasons, include, the, need, for, an, increase, in, the, space, requirements, beyond, the, limits, of, the, current, file, system, the, depth, of, path, may, need, to, be, increased, beyond, the, restrictions, of, the, file, system, there, may, be, performance, or, reliability, considerations, providing, access, to, another, operating, system, which, does, not, support, the, existing, file, system, is, another, reason, in, some, cases, conversion, can, be, done, in, place, although, migrating, the, file, system, is, more, conservative, as, it, involves, a, creating, a, copy, of, the, data, and, is, recommended, on, windows, fat, and, fat32, file, systems, can, be, converted, to, ntfs, via, the, convert, exe, utility, but, not, the, reverse, on, linux, ext2, can, be, converted, to, ext3, and, converted, back, and, ext3, can, be, converted, to, ext4, but, not, back, and, both, ext3, and, ext4, can, be, converted, to, btrfs, and, converted, back, until, the, undo, information, is, deleted, these, conversions, are, possible, due, to, using, the, same, format, for, the, file, data, itself, and, relocating, the, metadata, into, empty, space, in, some, cases, using, sparse, file, support, migration, has, the, disadvantage, of, requiring, additional, space, although, it, may, be, faster, the, best, case, is, if, there, is, unused, space, on, media, which, will, contain, the, final, file, system, for, example, to, migrate, a, fat32, file, system, to, an, ext2, file, system, a, new, ext2, file, system, is, created, then, the, data, from, the, fat32, file, system, is, copied, to, the, ext2, one, and, the, old, file, system, is, deleted, an, alternative, when, there, is, not, sufficient, space, to, retain, the, original, file, system, until, the, new, one, is, created, is, to, use, a, work, area, such, as, a, removable, media, this, takes, longer, but, has, the, benefit, of, producing, a, backup, in, hierarchical, file, systems, files, are, accessed, by, means, of, a, path, that, is, a, branching, list, of, directories, containing, the, file, different, file, systems, have, different, limits, on, the, depth, of, the, path, file, systems, also, have, a, limit, on, the, length, of, an, individual, file, name, copying, files, with, long, names, or, located, in, paths, of, significant, depth, from, one, file, system, to, another, may, cause, undesirable, results, this, depends, on, how, the, utility, doing, the, copying, handles, the, discrepancy
