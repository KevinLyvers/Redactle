plastics, are, a, wide, range, of, synthetic, or, semi, synthetic, materials, that, use, polymers, as, a, main, ingredient, their, plasticity, makes, it, possible, for, plastics, to, be, molded, extruded, or, pressed, into, solid, objects, of, various, shapes, this, adaptability, plus, a, wide, range, of, other, properties, such, as, being, lightweight, durable, flexible, and, inexpensive, to, produce, has, led, to, their, widespread, use, plastics, typically, are, made, through, human, industrial, systems, most, modern, plastics, are, derived, from, fossil, fuel, based, chemicals, like, natural, gas, or, petroleum, however, recent, industrial, methods, use, variants, made, from, renewable, materials, such, as, corn, or, cotton, derivatives, 9, 2, billion, metric, tons, of, plastic, are, estimated, to, have, been, made, between, 1950, and, 2017, more, than, half, of, which, has, been, produced, since, 2004, in, 2020, 400, million, tons, of, plastic, were, produced, if, global, trends, on, plastic, demand, continue, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2050, annual, global, plastic, production, will, reach, over, 1, 1, billion, tons, the, success, and, dominance, of, plastics, starting, in, the, early, 20th, century, has, caused, widespread, environmental, problems, due, to, their, slow, decomposition, rate, in, natural, ecosystems, most, plastic, produced, has, not, been, reused, or, is, incapable, of, reuse, either, being, captured, in, landfills, or, persisting, in, the, environment, as, plastic, pollution, and, microplastics, plastic, pollution, can, be, found, in, all, the, world, s, major, water, bodies, for, example, creating, garbage, patches, in, all, of, the, world, s, oceans, and, contaminating, terrestrial, ecosystems, of, all, the, plastic, discarded, so, far, some, 14, has, been, incinerated, and, less, than, 10, has, been, recycled, in, developed, economies, about, a, third, of, plastic, is, used, in, packaging, and, roughly, the, same, in, buildings, in, applications, such, as, piping, plumbing, or, vinyl, siding, other, uses, include, automobiles, up, to, 20, plastic, furniture, and, toys, in, the, developing, world, the, applications, of, plastic, may, differ, 42, of, india, s, consumption, is, used, in, packaging, in, the, medical, field, polymer, implants, and, other, medical, devices, are, derived, at, least, partially, from, plastic, worldwide, about, 50, kg, of, plastic, is, produced, annually, per, person, with, production, doubling, every, ten, years, the, world, s, first, fully, synthetic, plastic, was, bakelite, invented, in, new, york, in, 1907, by, leo, baekeland, who, coined, the, term, plastics, dozens, of, different, types, of, plastics, are, produced, today, such, as, polyethylene, which, is, widely, used, in, product, packaging, and, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, used, in, construction, and, pipes, because, of, its, strength, and, durability, many, chemists, have, contributed, to, the, materials, science, of, plastics, including, nobel, laureate, hermann, staudinger, who, has, been, called, the, father, of, polymer, chemistry, and, herman, mark, known, as, the, father, of, polymer, physics, the, word, plastic, derives, from, the, greek, plastikos, meaning, capable, of, being, shaped, or, molded, and, in, turn, from, plastos, meaning, molded, as, a, noun, the, word, most, commonly, refers, to, the, solid, products, of, petrochemical, derived, manufacturing, the, noun, plasticity, refers, specifically, here, to, the, deformability, of, the, materials, used, in, the, manufacture, of, plastics, plasticity, allows, molding, extrusion, or, compression, into, a, variety, of, shapes, films, fibers, plates, tubes, bottles, and, boxes, among, many, others, plasticity, also, has, a, technical, definition, in, materials, science, outside, the, scope, of, this, article, referring, to, the, non, reversible, change, in, form, of, solid, substances, most, plastics, contain, organic, polymers, the, vast, majority, of, these, polymers, are, formed, from, chains, of, carbon, atoms, with, or, without, the, attachment, of, oxygen, nitrogen, or, sulfur, atoms, these, chains, comprise, many, repeating, units, formed, from, monomers, each, polymer, chain, consists, of, several, thousand, repeating, units, the, backbone, is, the, part, of, the, chain, that, is, on, the, main, path, linking, together, a, large, number, of, repeat, units, to, customize, the, properties, of, a, plastic, different, molecular, groups, called, side, chains, hang, from, this, backbone, they, are, usually, hung, from, the, monomers, before, the, monomers, themselves, are, linked, together, to, form, the, polymer, chain, the, structure, of, these, side, chains, influences, the, properties, of, the, polymer, plastics, are, usually, classified, by, the, chemical, structure, of, the, polymer, s, backbone, and, side, chains, important, groups, classified, in, this, way, include, the, acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and, halogenated, plastics, plastics, can, be, classified, by, the, chemical, process, used, in, their, synthesis, such, as, condensation, polyaddition, and, cross, linking, they, can, also, be, classified, by, their, physical, properties, including, hardness, density, tensile, strength, thermal, resistance, and, glass, transition, temperature, plastics, can, additionally, be, classified, by, their, resistance, and, reactions, to, various, substances, and, processes, such, as, exposure, to, organic, solvents, oxidation, and, ionizing, radiation, other, classifications, of, plastics, are, based, on, qualities, relevant, to, manufacturing, or, product, design, for, a, particular, purpose, examples, include, thermoplastics, thermosets, conductive, polymers, biodegradable, plastics, engineering, plastics, and, elastomers, one, important, classification, of, plastics, is, the, degree, to, which, the, chemical, processes, used, to, make, them, are, reversible, or, not, thermoplastics, do, not, undergo, chemical, change, in, their, composition, when, heated, and, thus, can, be, molded, repeatedly, examples, include, polyethylene, pe, polypropylene, pp, polystyrene, ps, and, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, thermosets, or, thermosetting, polymers, can, melt, and, take, shape, only, once, after, they, have, solidified, they, stay, solid, if, reheated, thermosets, decompose, rather, than, melt, in, the, thermosetting, process, an, irreversible, chemical, reaction, occurs, the, vulcanization, of, rubber, is, an, example, of, this, process, before, heating, in, the, presence, of, sulfur, natural, rubber, polyisoprene, is, a, sticky, slightly, runny, material, after, vulcanization, the, product, is, dry, and, rigid, around, 70, of, global, production, is, concentrated, in, six, major, polymer, types, the, so, called, commodity, plastics, unlike, most, other, plastics, these, can, often, be, identified, by, their, resin, identification, code, ric, polyurethanes, pur, and, pp, a, fibers, are, often, also, included, as, major, commodity, classes, although, they, usually, lack, rics, as, they, are, chemically, quite, diverse, groups, these, materials, are, inexpensive, versatile, and, easy, to, work, with, making, them, the, preferred, choice, for, the, mass, production, everyday, objects, their, biggest, single, application, is, in, packaging, with, some, 146, million, tonnes, being, used, this, way, in, 2015, equivalent, to, 36, of, global, production, due, to, their, dominance, many, of, the, properties, and, problems, commonly, associated, with, plastics, such, as, pollution, stemming, from, their, poor, biodegradability, are, ultimately, attributable, to, commodity, plastics, a, huge, number, of, plastics, exist, beyond, the, commodity, plastics, with, many, having, exceptional, properties, engineering, plastics, are, more, robust, and, are, used, to, make, products, such, as, vehicle, parts, building, and, construction, materials, and, some, machine, parts, in, some, cases, they, are, polymer, blends, formed, by, mixing, different, plastics, together, abs, hips, etc, engineering, plastics, can, replace, metals, in, vehicles, lowering, their, weight, and, improving, fuel, efficiency, by, 6, 8, roughly, 50, of, the, volume, of, modern, cars, is, made, of, plastic, but, this, only, accounts, for, 12, 17, of, the, vehicle, weight, high, performance, plastics, are, usually, expensive, with, their, use, limited, to, specialized, applications, which, make, use, of, their, superior, properties, many, plastics, are, completely, amorphous, without, a, highly, ordered, molecular, structure, including, thermosets, polystyrene, and, methyl, methacrylate, pmma, crystalline, plastics, exhibit, a, pattern, of, more, regularly, spaced, atoms, such, as, high, density, polyethylene, hdpe, polybutylene, terephthalate, pbt, and, polyether, ether, ketone, peek, however, some, plastics, are, partially, amorphous, and, partially, crystalline, in, molecular, structure, giving, them, both, a, melting, point, and, one, or, more, glass, transitions, the, temperature, above, which, the, extent, of, localized, molecular, flexibility, is, substantially, increased, these, so, called, semi, crystalline, plastics, include, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl, chloride, polyamides, nylons, polyesters, and, some, polyurethanes, intrinsically, conducting, polymers, icp, are, organic, polymers, that, conduct, electricity, while, a, conductivity, of, up, to, 80, ks, cm, in, stretch, oriented, polyacetylene, has, been, achieved, it, does, not, approach, that, of, most, metals, for, example, copper, has, a, conductivity, of, several, hundred, ks, cm, biodegradable, plastics, are, plastics, that, degrade, break, down, upon, exposure, to, sunlight, or, ultra, violet, radiation, water, or, dampness, bacteria, enzymes, or, wind, abrasion, attack, by, insects, such, as, waxworms, and, mealworms, can, also, be, considered, as, forms, of, biodegradation, aerobic, degradation, requires, that, the, plastic, be, exposed, at, the, surface, whereas, anaerobic, degradation, would, be, effective, in, landfill, or, composting, systems, some, companies, produce, biodegradable, additives, to, enhance, biodegradation, although, starch, powder, can, be, added, as, a, filler, to, allow, some, plastics, to, degrade, more, easily, such, treatment, does, not, lead, to, complete, breakdown, some, researchers, have, genetically, engineered, bacteria, to, synthesize, completely, biodegradable, plastics, such, as, polyhydroxy, butyrate, phb, however, these, were, still, relatively, costly, as, of, 2021, while, most, plastics, are, produced, from, petrochemicals, bioplastics, are, made, substantially, from, renewable, plant, materials, like, cellulose, and, starch, due, both, to, the, finite, limits, of, fossil, fuel, reserves, and, to, rising, levels, of, greenhouse, gases, caused, primarily, by, the, burning, of, those, fuels, the, development, of, bioplastics, is, a, growing, field, global, production, capacity, for, bio, based, plastics, is, estimated, at, 327, 000, tonnes, per, year, in, contrast, global, production, of, polyethylene, pe, and, polypropylene, pp, the, world, s, leading, petrochemical, derived, polyolefins, was, estimated, at, over, 150, million, tonnes, in, 2015, the, plastic, industry, includes, the, global, production, compounding, conversion, and, sale, of, plastic, products, although, the, middle, east, and, russia, produce, most, of, the, required, petrochemical, raw, materials, the, production, of, plastic, is, concentrated, in, the, global, east, and, west, the, plastic, industry, comprises, a, huge, number, of, companies, and, can, be, divided, into, several, sectors, between, 1950, and, 2017, 9, 2, billion, tonnes, of, plastic, are, estimated, to, have, been, made, with, more, than, half, this, having, been, produced, since, 2004, since, the, birth, of, the, plastic, industry, in, the, 1950s, global, production, has, increased, enormously, reaching, 400, million, tonnes, a, year, in, 2021, this, is, up, from, 381, million, metric, tonnes, in, 2015, excluding, additives, from, the, 1950s, rapid, growth, occurred, in, the, use, of, plastics, for, packaging, in, building, and, construction, and, in, other, sectors, if, global, trends, on, plastic, demand, continue, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2050, annual, global, plastic, production, will, exceed, 1, 1, billion, tonnes, annually, plastics, are, produced, in, chemical, plants, by, the, polymerization, of, their, starting, materials, monomers, which, are, almost, always, petrochemical, in, nature, such, facilities, are, normally, large, and, are, visually, similar, to, oil, refineries, with, sprawling, pipework, running, throughout, the, large, size, of, these, plants, allows, them, to, exploit, economies, of, scale, despite, this, plastic, production, is, not, particularly, monopolized, with, about, 100, companies, accounting, for, 90, of, global, production, this, includes, a, mixture, of, private, and, state, owned, enterprises, roughly, half, of, all, production, takes, place, in, east, asia, with, china, being, the, largest, single, producer, major, international, producers, include, historically, europe, and, north, america, have, dominated, global, plastics, production, however, since, 2010, asia, has, emerged, as, a, significant, producer, with, china, accounting, for, 31, of, total, plastic, resin, production, in, 2020, regional, differences, in, the, volume, of, plastics, production, are, driven, by, user, demand, the, price, of, fossil, fuel, feedstocks, and, investments, made, in, the, petrochemical, industry, for, example, since, 2010, over, us, 200, billion, has, been, invested, in, the, united, states, in, new, plastic, and, chemical, plants, stimulated, by, the, low, cost, of, raw, materials, in, the, european, union, eu, too, heavy, investments, have, been, made, in, the, plastics, industry, which, employs, over, 1, 6, million, people, with, a, turnover, of, more, than, 360, billion, euros, per, year, in, china, in, 2016, there, were, over, 15, 000, plastic, manufacturing, companies, generating, more, than, us, 366, billion, in, revenue, in, 2017, the, global, plastics, market, was, dominated, by, thermoplastics, polymers, that, can, be, melted, and, recast, thermoplastics, include, polyethylene, pe, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, polypropylene, pp, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, polystyrene, ps, and, synthetic, fibers, which, together, represent, 86, of, all, plastics, plastic, is, not, sold, as, a, pure, unadulterated, substance, but, is, instead, mixed, with, various, chemicals, and, other, materials, which, are, collectively, known, as, additives, these, are, added, during, the, compounding, stage, and, include, substances, such, as, stabilizers, plasticizers, and, dyes, which, are, intended, to, improve, the, lifespan, workability, or, appearance, of, the, final, item, in, some, cases, this, can, involve, mixing, different, types, of, plastic, together, to, form, a, polymer, blend, such, as, high, impact, polystyrene, large, companies, may, do, their, own, compounding, prior, to, production, but, some, producers, have, it, done, by, a, third, party, companies, that, specialize, in, this, work, are, known, as, compounders, the, compounding, of, thermosetting, plastic, is, relatively, straightforward, as, it, remains, liquid, until, it, is, cured, into, its, final, form, for, thermosoftening, materials, which, are, used, to, make, the, majority, of, products, it, is, necessary, to, melt, the, plastic, in, order, to, mix, in, the, additives, this, involves, heating, it, to, anywhere, between, 150, 320, c, 300, 610, f, molten, plastic, is, viscous, and, exhibits, laminar, flow, leading, to, poor, mixing, compounding, is, therefore, done, using, extrusion, equipment, which, is, able, to, supply, the, necessary, heat, and, mixing, to, give, a, properly, dispersed, product, the, concentrations, of, most, additives, are, usually, quite, low, however, high, levels, can, be, added, to, create, masterbatch, products, the, additives, in, these, are, concentrated, but, still, properly, dispersed, in, the, host, resin, masterbatch, granules, can, be, mixed, with, cheaper, bulk, polymer, and, will, release, their, additives, during, processing, to, give, a, homogeneous, final, product, this, can, be, cheaper, than, working, with, a, fully, compounded, material, and, is, particularly, common, for, the, introduction, of, color, companies, that, produce, finished, goods, are, known, as, converters, sometimes, processors, the, vast, majority, of, plastics, produced, worldwide, are, thermosoftening, and, must, be, heated, until, molten, in, order, to, be, molded, various, sorts, of, extrusion, equipment, exist, which, can, then, form, the, plastic, into, almost, any, shape, for, thermosetting, materials, the, process, is, slightly, different, as, the, plastics, are, liquid, to, begin, with, and, but, must, be, cured, to, give, solid, products, but, much, of, the, equipment, is, broadly, similar, the, most, commonly, produced, plastic, consumer, products, include, packaging, made, from, ldpe, e, g, bags, containers, food, packaging, film, containers, made, from, hdpe, e, g, milk, bottles, shampoo, bottles, ice, cream, tubs, and, pet, e, g, bottles, for, water, and, other, drinks, together, these, products, account, for, around, 36, of, plastics, use, in, the, world, most, of, them, e, g, disposable, cups, plates, cutlery, takeaway, containers, carrier, bags, are, used, for, only, a, short, period, many, for, less, than, a, day, the, use, of, plastics, in, building, and, construction, textiles, transportation, and, electrical, equipment, also, accounts, for, a, substantial, share, of, the, plastics, market, plastic, items, used, for, such, purposes, generally, have, longer, life, spans, they, may, be, in, use, for, periods, ranging, from, around, five, years, e, g, textiles, and, electrical, equipment, to, more, than, 20, years, e, g, construction, materials, industrial, machinery, plastic, consumption, differs, among, countries, and, communities, with, some, form, of, plastic, having, made, its, way, into, most, people, s, lives, north, america, i, e, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, or, nafta, region, accounts, for, 21, of, global, plastic, consumption, closely, followed, by, china, 20, and, western, europe, 18, in, north, america, and, europe, there, is, high, per, capita, plastic, consumption, 94, kg, and, 85, kg, capita, year, respectively, in, china, there, is, lower, per, capita, consumption, 58, kg, capita, year, but, high, consumption, nationally, because, of, its, large, population, the, largest, application, for, plastics, is, as, packaging, materials, but, they, are, used, in, a, wide, range, of, other, sectors, including, construction, pipes, gutters, door, and, windows, textiles, stretchable, fabrics, fleece, consumer, goods, toys, tableware, toothbrushes, transportation, headlights, bumpers, body, panels, wing, mirrors, electronics, phones, computers, televisions, and, as, machine, parts, additives, are, chemicals, blended, into, plastics, to, change, their, performance, or, appearance, making, it, possible, to, alter, the, properties, of, plastics, to, better, suit, their, intended, applications, additives, are, therefore, one, of, the, reasons, why, plastic, is, used, so, widely, plastics, are, composed, of, chains, of, polymers, many, different, chemicals, are, used, as, plastic, additives, a, randomly, chosen, plastic, product, generally, contains, around, 20, additives, the, identities, and, concentrations, of, additives, are, generally, not, listed, on, products, in, the, eu, over, 400, additives, are, used, in, high, volumes, 5500, additives, were, found, in, a, global, market, analysis, at, a, minimum, all, plastic, contains, some, polymer, stabilizers, which, permit, them, to, be, melt, processed, molded, without, suffering, polymer, degradation, other, additives, are, optional, and, can, be, added, as, required, with, loadings, varying, significantly, between, applications, the, amount, of, additives, contained, in, plastics, varies, depending, on, the, additives, function, for, example, additives, in, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, can, constitute, up, to, 80, of, the, total, volume, pure, unadulterated, plastic, barefoot, resin, is, never, sold, even, by, the, primary, producers, additives, may, be, weakly, bound, to, the, polymers, or, react, in, the, polymer, matrix, although, additives, are, blended, into, plastic, they, remain, chemically, distinct, from, it, and, can, gradually, leach, back, out, during, normal, use, when, in, landfills, or, following, improper, disposal, in, the, environment, additives, may, also, degrade, to, form, other, toxic, molecules, plastic, fragmentation, into, microplastics, and, nanoplastics, can, allow, chemical, additives, to, move, in, the, environment, far, from, the, point, of, use, once, released, some, additives, and, derivatives, may, persist, in, the, environment, and, bioaccumulate, in, organisms, they, can, have, adverse, effects, on, human, health, and, biota, a, recent, review, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, us, epa, revealed, that, out, of, 3, 377, chemicals, potentially, associated, with, plastic, packaging, and, 906, likely, associated, with, it, 68, were, ranked, by, echa, as, highest, for, human, health, hazards, and, 68, as, highest, for, environmental, hazards, as, additives, change, the, properties, of, plastics, they, have, to, be, considered, during, recycling, presently, almost, all, recycling, is, performed, by, simply, remelting, and, reforming, used, plastic, into, new, items, additives, present, risks, in, recycled, products, as, they, are, difficult, to, remove, when, plastic, products, are, recycled, it, is, highly, likely, that, the, additives, will, be, integrated, into, the, new, products, waste, plastic, even, if, it, is, all, of, the, same, polymer, type, will, contain, varying, types, and, amounts, of, additives, mixing, these, together, can, give, a, material, with, inconsistent, properties, which, can, be, unappealing, to, industry, for, example, mixing, different, colored, plastics, with, different, plastic, colorants, together, can, produce, a, discolored, or, brown, material, and, for, this, reason, plastic, is, usually, sorted, by, both, polymer, type, and, color, before, recycling, absence, of, transparency, and, reporting, across, the, value, chain, often, results, in, lack, of, knowledge, concerning, the, chemical, profile, of, the, final, products, for, example, products, containing, brominated, flame, retardants, have, been, incorporated, into, new, plastic, products, flame, retardants, are, a, group, of, chemicals, used, in, electronic, and, electrical, equipment, textiles, furniture, and, construction, materials, which, should, not, be, present, in, food, packaging, or, child, care, products, a, recent, study, found, brominated, dioxins, as, unintentional, contaminants, in, toys, made, from, recycled, plastic, electronic, waste, that, contained, brominated, flame, retardants, brominated, dioxins, have, been, found, to, exhibit, toxicity, similar, to, that, of, chlorinated, dioxins, they, can, have, negative, developmental, effects, and, negative, effects, on, the, nervous, system, and, interfere, with, mechanisms, of, the, endocrine, system, many, of, the, controversies, associated, with, plastics, actually, relate, to, their, additives, as, some, compounds, can, be, persistent, bioaccumulating, and, potentially, harmful, the, now, banned, flame, retardants, octabde, and, pentabde, are, an, example, of, this, while, the, health, effects, of, phthalates, are, an, ongoing, area, of, public, concern, additives, can, also, be, problematic, if, waste, is, burned, especially, when, burning, is, uncontrolled, or, takes, place, in, low, technology, incinerators, as, is, common, in, many, developing, countries, incomplete, combustion, can, cause, emissions, of, hazardous, substances, such, as, acid, gases, and, ash, which, can, contain, persistent, organic, pollutants, pops, such, as, dioxins, a, number, of, additives, identified, as, hazardous, to, humans, and, or, the, environment, are, regulated, internationally, the, stockholm, convention, on, persistent, organic, pollutants, pops, is, a, global, treaty, to, protect, human, health, and, the, environment, from, chemicals, that, remain, intact, in, the, environment, for, long, periods, become, widely, distributed, geographically, accumulate, in, the, fatty, tissue, of, humans, and, wildlife, and, have, harmful, impacts, on, human, health, or, on, the, environment, other, additives, proven, to, be, harmful, such, as, cadmium, chromium, lead, and, mercury, regulated, under, the, minamata, convention, on, mercury, which, have, previously, been, used, in, plastic, production, are, banned, in, many, jurisdictions, however, they, are, still, routinely, found, in, some, plastic, packaging, including, food, packaging, the, use, of, the, additive, bisphenol, a, bpa, in, plastic, baby, bottles, is, banned, in, many, parts, of, the, world, but, is, not, restricted, in, some, low, income, countries, in, 2023, plasticosis, a, new, disease, caused, solely, by, plastics, was, discovered, in, seabirds, the, birds, identified, as, having, the, disease, have, scarred, digestive, tracts, from, ingesting, plastic, waste, when, birds, ingest, small, pieces, of, plastic, they, found, it, inflames, the, digestive, tract, over, time, the, persistent, inflammation, causes, tissues, to, become, scarred, and, disfigured, affecting, digestion, growth, and, survival, pure, plastics, have, low, toxicity, due, to, their, insolubility, in, water, and, because, they, have, a, large, molecular, weight, they, are, biochemically, inert, plastic, products, contain, a, variety, of, additives, however, some, of, which, can, be, toxic, for, example, plasticizers, like, adipates, and, phthalates, are, often, added, to, brittle, plastics, like, pvc, to, make, them, pliable, enough, for, use, in, food, packaging, toys, and, many, other, items, traces, of, these, compounds, can, leach, out, of, the, product, owing, to, concerns, over, the, effects, of, such, leachates, the, eu, has, restricted, the, use, of, dehp, di, 2, ethylhexyl, phthalate, and, other, phthalates, in, some, applications, and, the, us, has, limited, the, use, of, dehp, dpb, bbp, dinp, didp, and, dnop, in, children, s, toys, and, child, care, articles, through, the, consumer, product, safety, improvement, act, some, compounds, leaching, from, polystyrene, food, containers, have, been, proposed, to, interfere, with, hormone, functions, and, are, suspected, human, carcinogens, cancer, causing, substances, other, chemicals, of, potential, concern, include, alkylphenols, while, a, finished, plastic, may, be, non, toxic, the, monomers, used, in, the, manufacture, of, its, parent, polymers, may, be, toxic, in, some, cases, small, amounts, of, those, chemicals, can, remain, trapped, in, the, product, unless, suitable, processing, is, employed, for, example, the, world, health, organization, s, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, has, recognized, vinyl, chloride, the, precursor, to, pvc, as, a, human, carcinogen, some, plastic, products, degrade, to, chemicals, with, estrogenic, activity, the, primary, building, block, of, polycarbonates, bisphenol, a, bpa, is, an, estrogen, like, endocrine, disruptor, that, may, leach, into, food, research, in, environmental, health, perspectives, finds, that, bpa, leached, from, the, lining, of, tin, cans, dental, sealants, and, polycarbonate, bottles, can, increase, the, body, weight, of, lab, animals, offspring, a, more, recent, animal, study, suggests, that, even, low, level, exposure, to, bpa, results, in, insulin, resistance, which, can, lead, to, inflammation, and, heart, disease, as, of, january, 2010, the, los, angeles, times, reported, that, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, is, spending, 30, million, to, investigate, indications, of, bpa, s, link, to, cancer, bis, 2, ethylhexyl, adipate, present, in, plastic, wrap, based, on, pvc, is, also, of, concern, as, are, the, volatile, organic, compounds, present, in, new, car, smell, the, eu, has, a, permanent, ban, on, the, use, of, phthalates, in, toys, in, 2009, the, us, government, banned, certain, types, of, phthalates, commonly, used, in, plastic, because, the, chemical, structure, of, most, plastics, renders, them, durable, they, are, resistant, to, many, natural, degradation, processes, much, of, this, material, may, persist, for, centuries, or, longer, given, the, demonstrated, persistence, of, structurally, similar, natural, materials, such, as, amber, there, are, differing, estimates, of, how, much, plastic, waste, has, been, produced, in, the, last, century, by, one, estimate, one, billion, tons, of, plastic, waste, have, been, discarded, since, the, 1950s, others, estimate, a, cumulative, human, production, of, 8, 3, billion, tons, of, plastic, of, which, 6, 3, billion, tons, is, waste, with, only, 9, getting, recycled, it, is, estimated, that, this, waste, is, made, up, of, 81, polymer, resin, 13, polymer, fibers, and, 32, additives, in, 2018, more, than, 343, million, tons, of, plastic, waste, were, generated, 90, of, which, was, composed, of, post, consumer, plastic, waste, industrial, agricultural, commercial, and, municipal, plastic, waste, the, rest, was, pre, consumer, waste, from, resin, production, and, manufacturing, of, plastic, products, e, g, materials, rejected, due, to, unsuitable, color, hardness, or, processing, characteristics, the, ocean, conservancy, reported, that, china, indonesia, philippines, thailand, and, vietnam, dump, more, plastic, into, the, sea, than, all, other, countries, combined, the, rivers, yangtze, indus, yellow, hai, nile, ganges, pearl, amur, niger, and, mekong, transport, 88, to, 95, of, the, global, load, into, the, sea, the, presence, of, plastics, particularly, microplastics, within, the, food, chain, is, increasing, in, the, 1960s, microplastics, were, observed, in, the, guts, of, seabirds, and, since, then, have, been, found, in, increasing, concentrations, the, long, term, effects, of, plastics, in, the, food, chain, are, poorly, understood, in, 2009, it, was, estimated, that, 10, of, modern, waste, was, plastic, although, estimates, vary, according, to, region, meanwhile, 50, to, 80, of, debris, in, marine, areas, is, plastic, plastic, is, often, used, in, agriculture, there, is, more, plastic, in, the, soil, than, in, the, oceans, the, presence, of, plastic, in, the, environment, hurts, ecosystems, and, human, health, research, on, the, environmental, impacts, has, typically, focused, on, the, disposal, phase, however, the, production, of, plastics, is, also, responsible, for, substantial, environmental, health, and, socioeconomic, impacts, prior, to, the, montreal, protocol, cfcs, had, been, commonly, used, in, the, manufacture, of, the, plastic, polystyrene, the, production, of, which, had, contributed, to, depletion, of, the, ozone, layer, efforts, to, minimize, environmental, impact, of, plastics, may, include, lowering, of, plastics, production, and, use, waste, and, recycling, policies, and, the, proactive, development, and, deployment, of, alternatives, to, plastics, such, as, for, sustainable, packaging, microplastics, are, fragments, of, any, type, of, plastic, less, than, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, in, length, according, to, the, u, s, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, and, the, european, chemicals, agency, they, cause, pollution, by, entering, natural, ecosystems, from, a, variety, of, sources, including, cosmetics, clothing, food, packaging, and, industrial, processes, the, term, macroplastics, is, used, to, differentiate, microplastics, from, larger, plastic, waste, such, as, plastic, bottles, or, bigger, pieces, of, plastics, two, classifications, of, microplastics, are, currently, recognized, primary, microplastics, include, any, plastic, fragments, or, particles, that, are, already, 5, 0, mm, in, size, or, less, before, entering, the, environment, these, include, microfibers, from, clothing, microbeads, plastic, glitter, and, plastic, pellets, also, known, as, nurdles, secondary, microplastics, arise, from, the, degradation, breakdown, of, larger, plastic, products, through, natural, weathering, processes, after, entering, the, environment, such, sources, of, secondary, microplastics, include, water, and, soda, bottles, fishing, nets, plastic, bags, microwave, containers, tea, bags, and, tire, wear, both, types, are, recognized, to, persist, in, the, environment, at, high, levels, particularly, in, aquatic, and, marine, ecosystems, where, they, cause, water, pollution, 35, of, all, ocean, microplastics, come, from, textiles, clothing, primarily, due, to, the, erosion, of, polyester, acrylic, or, nylon, based, clothing, often, during, the, washing, process, however, microplastics, also, accumulate, in, the, air, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, because, plastics, degrade, slowly, often, over, hundreds, to, thousands, of, years, microplastics, have, a, high, probability, of, ingestion, incorporation, into, and, accumulation, in, the, bodies, and, tissues, of, many, organisms, the, toxic, chemicals, that, come, from, both, the, ocean, and, runoff, can, also, biomagnify, up, the, food, chain, in, terrestrial, ecosystems, microplastics, have, been, demonstrated, to, reduce, the, viability, of, soil, ecosystems, and, reduce, weight, of, earthworms, the, cycle, and, movement, of, microplastics, in, the, environment, are, not, fully, known, but, research, is, currently, underway, to, investigate, the, phenomenon, deep, layer, ocean, sediment, surveys, in, china, 2020, show, the, presence, of, plastics, in, deposition, layers, far, older, than, the, invention, of, plastics, leading, to, suspected, underestimation, of, microplastics, in, surface, sample, ocean, surveys, likewise, they, have, been, found, in, high, mountains, at, great, distances, from, their, source, a, study, in, 2024, found, microplastics, in, every, semen, sample, tested, microplastics, have, also, been, found, in, human, blood, though, their, effects, are, largely, unknown, plastics, degrade, by, a, variety, of, processes, the, most, significant, of, which, is, usually, photo, oxidation, their, chemical, structure, determines, their, fate, polymers, marine, degradation, takes, much, longer, as, a, result, of, the, saline, environment, and, cooling, effect, of, the, sea, contributing, to, the, persistence, of, plastic, debris, in, certain, environments, recent, studies, have, shown, however, that, plastics, in, the, ocean, decompose, faster, than, had, been, previously, thought, due, to, exposure, to, the, sun, rain, and, other, environmental, conditions, resulting, in, the, release, of, toxic, chemicals, such, as, bisphenol, a, however, due, to, the, increased, volume, of, plastics, in, the, ocean, decomposition, has, slowed, down, the, marine, conservancy, has, predicted, the, decomposition, rates, of, several, plastic, products, it, is, estimated, that, a, foam, plastic, cup, will, take, 50, years, a, plastic, beverage, holder, will, take, 400, years, a, disposable, diaper, will, take, 450, years, and, fishing, line, will, take, 600, years, to, degrade, microbial, species, capable, of, degrading, plastics, are, known, to, science, some, of, which, are, potentially, useful, for, disposal, of, certain, classes, of, plastic, waste, plastic, recycling, is, the, processing, of, plastic, waste, into, other, products, recycling, can, reduce, dependence, on, landfill, conserve, resources, and, protect, the, environment, from, plastic, pollution, and, greenhouse, gas, emissions, recycling, rates, lag, behind, those, of, other, recoverable, materials, such, as, aluminium, glass, and, paper, from, the, start, of, plastic, production, through, to, 2015, the, world, produced, around, 6, 3, billion, tonnes, of, plastic, waste, only, 9, of, which, has, been, recycled, and, only, 1, has, been, recycled, more, than, once, of, the, remaining, waste, 12, was, incinerated, and, 79, was, either, sent, to, landfills, or, lost, to, the, environment, as, pollution, almost, all, plastic, is, non, biodegradable, and, without, recycling, spreads, across, the, environment, where, it, causes, plastic, pollution, for, example, as, of, 2015, approximately, 8, million, tonnes, of, waste, plastic, enters, the, oceans, annually, damaging, oceanic, ecosystems, and, forming, ocean, garbage, patches, almost, all, recycling, is, mechanical, and, involves, the, melting, and, reforming, of, plastic, into, other, items, this, can, cause, polymer, degradation, at, the, molecular, level, and, requires, that, waste, be, sorted, by, colour, and, polymer, type, before, processing, which, is, often, complicated, and, expensive, errors, can, lead, to, material, with, inconsistent, properties, rendering, it, unappealing, to, industry, though, filtration, in, mechanical, recycling, reduces, microplastic, release, even, the, most, efficient, filtration, systems, cannot, prevent, the, release, of, microplastics, into, wastewater, in, feedstock, recycling, waste, plastic, is, converted, into, its, starting, chemicals, which, can, then, become, fresh, plastic, this, involves, higher, energy, and, capital, costs, alternatively, plastic, can, be, burned, in, place, of, fossil, fuels, in, energy, recovery, facilities, or, biochemically, converted, into, other, useful, chemicals, for, industry, in, some, countries, burning, is, the, dominant, form, of, plastic, waste, disposal, particularly, where, landfill, diversion, policies, are, in, place, plastic, recycling, is, low, in, the, waste, hierarchy, meaning, that, reduction, and, reuse, are, more, favourable, and, long, term, solutions, for, sustainability, by, heating, to, above, 500, c, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, pyrolysis, plastics, can, be, broken, down, into, simpler, hydrocarbons, these, can, be, reused, as, starting, materials, for, new, plastics, they, can, also, be, used, as, fuels, according, to, the, oecd, plastic, contributed, greenhouse, gases, in, the, equivalent, of, 1, 8, billion, tons, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, to, the, atmosphere, in, 2019, 3, 4, of, global, emissions, they, say, that, by, 2060, plastic, could, emit, 4, 3, billion, tons, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, a, year, the, effect, of, plastics, on, global, warming, is, mixed, plastics, are, generally, made, from, fossil, gas, or, petroleum, thus, the, production, of, plastics, creates, further, fugitive, emissions, of, methane, when, the, fossil, gas, or, petroleum, is, produced, also, much, of, the, energy, used, in, plastic, production, is, not, sustainable, energy, for, example, high, temperature, from, burning, fossil, gas, however, plastics, can, also, limit, methane, emissions, for, example, packaging, to, reduce, food, waste, a, study, from, 2024, found, that, compared, to, glass, and, aluminum, plastic, may, actually, have, less, of, a, negative, effect, on, the, environment, and, therefore, might, be, the, best, option, for, must, food, packaging, and, other, common, uses, the, study, found, that, replacing, plastics, with, alternatives, is, worse, for, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, most, cases, and, that, the, study, involving, european, researchers, found, 15, of, the, 16, applications, a, plastic, product, incurs, fewer, greenhouse, gas, emissions, than, their, alternatives, production, of, plastics, from, crude, oil, requires, 7, 9, to, 13, 7, kwh, lb, taking, into, account, the, average, efficiency, of, us, utility, stations, of, 35, producing, silicon, and, semiconductors, for, modern, electronic, equipment, is, even, more, energy, consuming, 29, 2, to, 29, 8, kwh, lb, for, silicon, and, about, 381, kwh, lb, for, semiconductors, this, is, much, higher, than, the, energy, needed, to, produce, many, other, materials, for, example, to, produce, iron, from, iron, ore, requires, 2, 5, 3, 2, kwh, lb, of, energy, glass, from, sand, etc, 2, 3, 4, 4, kwh, lb, steel, from, iron, 2, 5, 6, 4, kwh, lb, and, paper, from, timber, 3, 2, 6, 4, kwh, lb, quickly, burning, plastics, at, very, high, temperatures, breaks, down, many, toxic, components, such, as, dioxins, and, furans, this, approach, is, widely, used, in, municipal, solid, waste, incineration, municipal, solid, waste, incinerators, also, normally, treat, the, flue, gas, to, decrease, pollutants, further, which, is, needed, because, uncontrolled, incineration, of, plastic, produces, carcinogenic, polychlorinated, dibenzo, p, dioxins, open, air, burning, of, plastic, occurs, at, lower, temperatures, and, normally, releases, such, toxic, fumes, in, the, european, union, municipal, waste, incineration, is, regulated, by, the, industrial, emissions, directive, which, stipulates, a, minimum, temperature, of, 850, c, for, at, least, two, seconds, the, development, of, plastics, has, evolved, from, the, use, of, naturally, plastic, materials, e, g, gums, and, shellac, to, the, use, of, the, chemical, modification, of, those, materials, e, g, natural, rubber, cellulose, collagen, and, milk, proteins, and, finally, to, completely, synthetic, plastics, e, g, bakelite, epoxy, and, pvc, early, plastics, were, bio, derived, materials, such, as, egg, and, blood, proteins, which, are, organic, polymers, in, around, 1600, bc, mesoamericans, used, natural, rubber, for, balls, bands, and, figurines, treated, cattle, horns, were, used, as, windows, for, lanterns, in, the, middle, ages, materials, that, mimicked, the, properties, of, horns, were, developed, by, treating, milk, proteins, with, lye, in, the, nineteenth, century, as, chemistry, developed, during, the, industrial, revolution, many, materials, were, reported, the, development, of, plastics, accelerated, with, charles, goodyear, s, 1839, discovery, of, vulcanization, to, harden, natural, rubber, parkesine, invented, by, alexander, parkes, in, 1855, and, patented, the, following, year, is, considered, the, first, man, made, plastic, it, was, manufactured, from, cellulose, the, major, component, of, plant, cell, walls, treated, with, nitric, acid, as, a, solvent, the, output, of, the, process, commonly, known, as, cellulose, nitrate, or, pyroxilin, could, be, dissolved, in, alcohol, and, hardened, into, a, transparent, and, elastic, material, that, could, be, molded, when, heated, by, incorporating, pigments, into, the, product, it, could, be, made, to, resemble, ivory, parkesine, was, unveiled, at, the, 1862, international, exhibition, in, london, and, garnered, for, parkes, the, bronze, medal, in, 1893, french, chemist, auguste, trillat, discovered, the, means, to, insolubilize, casein, milk, proteins, by, immersion, in, formaldehyde, producing, material, marketed, as, galalith, in, 1897, mass, printing, press, owner, wilhelm, krische, of, hanover, germany, was, commissioned, to, develop, an, alternative, to, blackboards, the, resultant, horn, like, plastic, made, from, casein, was, developed, in, cooperation, with, the, austrian, chemist, friedrich, adolph, spitteler, 1846, 1940, although, unsuitable, for, the, intended, purpose, other, uses, would, be, discovered, the, world, s, first, fully, synthetic, plastic, was, bakelite, invented, in, new, york, in, 1907, by, leo, baekeland, who, coined, the, term, plastics, many, chemists, have, contributed, to, the, materials, science, of, plastics, including, nobel, laureate, hermann, staudinger, who, has, been, called, the, father, of, polymer, chemistry, and, herman, mark, known, as, the, father, of, polymer, physics, after, world, war, i, improvements, in, chemistry, led, to, an, explosion, of, new, forms, of, plastics, with, mass, production, beginning, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, among, the, earliest, examples, in, the, wave, of, new, polymers, were, polystyrene, first, produced, by, basf, in, the, 1930s, and, polyvinyl, chloride, first, created, in, 1872, but, commercially, produced, in, the, late, 1920s, in, 1923, durite, plastics, inc, was, the, first, manufacturer, of, phenol, furfural, resins, in, 1933, polyethylene, was, discovered, by, imperial, chemical, industries, ici, researchers, reginald, gibson, and, eric, fawcett, the, discovery, of, polyethylene, terephthalate, is, credited, to, employees, of, the, calico, printers, association, in, the, uk, in, 1941, it, was, licensed, to, dupont, for, the, us, and, ici, otherwise, and, as, one, of, the, few, plastics, appropriate, as, a, replacement, for, glass, in, many, circumstances, resulting, in, widespread, use, for, bottles, in, europe, in, 1954, polypropylene, was, discovered, by, giulio, natta, and, began, to, be, manufactured, in, 1957, also, in, 1954, expanded, polystyrene, used, for, building, insulation, packaging, and, cups, was, invented, by, dow, chemical, work, is, currently, underway, to, develop, a, global, treaty, on, plastic, pollution, on, march, 2, 2022, un, member, states, voted, at, the, resumed, fifth, un, environment, assembly, unea, 5, 2, to, establish, an, intergovernmental,
