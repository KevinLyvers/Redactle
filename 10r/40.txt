the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, is, a, method, widely, used, to, make, millions, to, billions, of, copies, of, a, specific, dna, sample, rapidly, allowing, scientists, to, amplify, a, very, small, sample, of, dna, or, a, part, of, it, sufficiently, to, enable, detailed, study, pcr, was, invented, in, 1983, by, american, biochemist, kary, mullis, at, cetus, corporation, mullis, and, biochemist, michael, smith, who, had, developed, other, essential, ways, of, manipulating, dna, were, jointly, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1993, pcr, is, fundamental, to, many, of, the, procedures, used, in, genetic, testing, and, research, including, analysis, of, ancient, samples, of, dna, and, identification, of, infectious, agents, using, pcr, copies, of, very, small, amounts, of, dna, sequences, are, exponentially, amplified, in, a, series, of, cycles, of, temperature, changes, pcr, is, now, a, common, and, often, indispensable, technique, used, in, medical, laboratory, research, for, a, broad, variety, of, applications, including, biomedical, research, and, forensic, science, the, majority, of, pcr, methods, rely, on, thermal, cycling, thermal, cycling, exposes, reagents, to, repeated, cycles, of, heating, and, cooling, to, permit, different, temperature, dependent, reactions, specifically, dna, melting, and, enzyme, driven, dna, replication, pcr, employs, two, main, reagents, primers, which, are, short, single, strand, dna, fragments, known, as, oligonucleotides, that, are, a, complementary, sequence, to, the, target, dna, region, and, a, thermostable, dna, polymerase, in, the, first, step, of, pcr, the, two, strands, of, the, dna, double, helix, are, physically, separated, at, a, high, temperature, in, a, process, called, nucleic, acid, denaturation, in, the, second, step, the, temperature, is, lowered, and, the, primers, bind, to, the, complementary, sequences, of, dna, the, two, dna, strands, then, become, templates, for, dna, polymerase, to, enzymatically, assemble, a, new, dna, strand, from, free, nucleotides, the, building, blocks, of, dna, as, pcr, progresses, the, dna, generated, is, itself, used, as, a, template, for, replication, setting, in, motion, a, chain, reaction, in, which, the, original, dna, template, is, exponentially, amplified, almost, all, pcr, applications, employ, a, heat, stable, dna, polymerase, such, as, taq, polymerase, an, enzyme, originally, isolated, from, the, thermophilic, bacterium, thermus, aquaticus, if, the, polymerase, used, was, heat, susceptible, it, would, denature, under, the, high, temperatures, of, the, denaturation, step, before, the, use, of, taq, polymerase, dna, polymerase, had, to, be, manually, added, every, cycle, which, was, a, tedious, and, costly, process, applications, of, the, technique, include, dna, cloning, for, sequencing, gene, cloning, and, manipulation, gene, mutagenesis, construction, of, dna, based, phylogenies, or, functional, analysis, of, genes, diagnosis, and, monitoring, of, genetic, disorders, amplification, of, ancient, dna, analysis, of, genetic, fingerprints, for, dna, profiling, for, example, in, forensic, science, and, parentage, testing, and, detection, of, pathogens, in, nucleic, acid, tests, for, the, diagnosis, of, infectious, diseases, pcr, amplifies, a, specific, region, of, a, dna, strand, the, dna, target, most, pcr, methods, amplify, dna, fragments, of, between, 0, 1, and, 10, kilo, base, pairs, kbp, in, length, although, some, techniques, allow, for, amplification, of, fragments, up, to, 40, kbp, the, amount, of, amplified, product, is, determined, by, the, available, substrates, in, the, reaction, which, becomes, limiting, as, the, reaction, progresses, a, basic, pcr, set, up, requires, several, components, and, reagents, including, the, reaction, is, commonly, carried, out, in, a, volume, of, 10, 200, l, in, small, reaction, tubes, 0, 2, 0, 5, ml, volumes, in, a, thermal, cycler, the, thermal, cycler, heats, and, cools, the, reaction, tubes, to, achieve, the, temperatures, required, at, each, step, of, the, reaction, see, below, many, modern, thermal, cyclers, make, use, of, a, peltier, device, which, permits, both, heating, and, cooling, of, the, block, holding, the, pcr, tubes, simply, by, reversing, the, device, s, electric, current, thin, walled, reaction, tubes, permit, favorable, thermal, conductivity, to, allow, for, rapid, thermal, equilibrium, most, thermal, cyclers, have, heated, lids, to, prevent, condensation, at, the, top, of, the, reaction, tube, older, thermal, cyclers, lacking, a, heated, lid, require, a, layer, of, oil, on, top, of, the, reaction, mixture, or, a, ball, of, wax, inside, the, tube, typically, pcr, consists, of, a, series, of, 20, 40, repeated, temperature, changes, called, thermal, cycles, with, each, cycle, commonly, consisting, of, two, or, three, discrete, temperature, steps, see, figure, below, the, cycling, is, often, preceded, by, a, single, temperature, step, at, a, very, high, temperature, 90, c, 194, f, and, followed, by, one, hold, at, the, end, for, final, product, extension, or, brief, storage, the, temperatures, used, and, the, length, of, time, they, are, applied, in, each, cycle, depend, on, a, variety, of, parameters, including, the, enzyme, used, for, dna, synthesis, the, concentration, of, bivalent, ions, and, dntps, in, the, reaction, and, the, melting, temperature, t, m, of, the, primers, the, individual, steps, common, to, most, pcr, methods, are, as, follows, to, check, whether, the, pcr, successfully, generated, the, anticipated, dna, target, region, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, amplimer, or, amplicon, agarose, gel, electrophoresis, may, be, employed, for, size, separation, of, the, pcr, products, the, size, of, the, pcr, products, is, determined, by, comparison, with, a, dna, ladder, a, molecular, weight, marker, which, contains, dna, fragments, of, known, sizes, which, runs, on, the, gel, alongside, the, pcr, products, as, with, other, chemical, reactions, the, reaction, rate, and, efficiency, of, pcr, are, affected, by, limiting, factors, thus, the, entire, pcr, process, can, further, be, divided, into, three, stages, based, on, reaction, progress, in, practice, pcr, can, fail, for, various, reasons, such, as, sensitivity, or, contamination, contamination, with, extraneous, dna, can, lead, to, spurious, products, and, is, addressed, with, lab, protocols, and, procedures, that, separate, pre, pcr, mixtures, from, potential, dna, contaminants, for, instance, if, dna, from, a, crime, scene, is, analyzed, a, single, dna, molecule, from, lab, personnel, could, be, amplified, and, misguide, the, investigation, hence, the, pcr, setup, areas, is, separated, from, the, analysis, or, purification, of, other, pcr, products, disposable, plasticware, used, and, the, work, surface, between, reaction, setups, needs, to, be, thoroughly, cleaned, specificity, can, be, adjusted, by, experimental, conditions, so, that, no, spurious, products, are, generated, primer, design, techniques, are, important, in, improving, pcr, product, yield, and, in, avoiding, the, formation, of, unspecific, products, the, usage, of, alternate, buffer, components, or, polymerase, enzymes, can, help, with, amplification, of, long, or, otherwise, problematic, regions, of, dna, for, instance, q5, polymerase, is, said, to, be, 280, times, less, error, prone, than, taq, polymerase, both, the, running, parameters, e, g, temperature, and, duration, of, cycles, or, the, addition, of, reagents, such, as, formamide, may, increase, the, specificity, and, yield, of, pcr, computer, simulations, of, theoretical, pcr, results, electronic, pcr, may, be, performed, to, assist, in, primer, design, pcr, allows, isolation, of, dna, fragments, from, genomic, dna, by, selective, amplification, of, a, specific, region, of, dna, this, use, of, pcr, augments, many, ways, such, as, generating, hybridization, probes, for, southern, or, northern, hybridization, and, dna, cloning, which, require, larger, amounts, of, dna, representing, a, specific, dna, region, pcr, supplies, these, techniques, with, high, amounts, of, pure, dna, enabling, analysis, of, dna, samples, even, from, very, small, amounts, of, starting, material, other, applications, of, pcr, include, dna, sequencing, to, determine, unknown, pcr, amplified, sequences, in, which, one, of, the, amplification, primers, may, be, used, in, sanger, sequencing, isolation, of, a, dna, sequence, to, expedite, recombinant, dna, technologies, involving, the, insertion, of, a, dna, sequence, into, a, plasmid, phage, or, cosmid, depending, on, size, or, the, genetic, material, of, another, organism, bacterial, colonies, such, as, e, coli, can, be, rapidly, screened, by, pcr, for, correct, dna, vector, constructs, pcr, may, also, be, used, for, genetic, fingerprinting, a, forensic, technique, used, to, identify, a, person, or, organism, by, comparing, experimental, dnas, through, different, pcr, based, methods, some, pcr, fingerprint, methods, have, high, discriminative, power, and, can, be, used, to, identify, genetic, relationships, between, individuals, such, as, parent, child, or, between, siblings, and, are, used, in, paternity, testing, fig, 4, this, technique, may, also, be, used, to, determine, evolutionary, relationships, among, organisms, when, certain, molecular, clocks, are, used, i, e, the, 16s, rrna, and, reca, genes, of, microorganisms, because, pcr, amplifies, the, regions, of, dna, that, it, targets, pcr, can, be, used, to, analyze, extremely, small, amounts, of, sample, this, is, often, critical, for, forensic, analysis, when, only, a, trace, amount, of, dna, is, available, as, evidence, pcr, may, also, be, used, in, the, analysis, of, ancient, dna, that, is, tens, of, thousands, of, years, old, these, pcr, based, techniques, have, been, successfully, used, on, animals, such, as, a, forty, thousand, year, old, mammoth, and, also, on, human, dna, in, applications, ranging, from, the, analysis, of, egyptian, mummies, to, the, identification, of, a, russian, tsar, and, the, body, of, english, king, richard, iii, quantitative, pcr, or, real, time, pcr, qpcr, not, to, be, confused, with, rt, pcr, methods, allow, the, estimation, of, the, amount, of, a, given, sequence, present, in, a, sample, a, technique, often, applied, to, quantitatively, determine, levels, of, gene, expression, quantitative, pcr, is, an, established, tool, for, dna, quantification, that, measures, the, accumulation, of, dna, product, after, each, round, of, pcr, amplification, qpcr, allows, the, quantification, and, detection, of, a, specific, dna, sequence, in, real, time, since, it, measures, concentration, while, the, synthesis, process, is, taking, place, there, are, two, methods, for, simultaneous, detection, and, quantification, the, first, method, consists, of, using, fluorescent, dyes, that, are, retained, nonspecifically, in, between, the, double, strands, the, second, method, involves, probes, that, code, for, specific, sequences, and, are, fluorescently, labeled, detection, of, dna, using, these, methods, can, only, be, seen, after, the, hybridization, of, probes, with, its, complementary, dna, cdna, takes, place, an, interesting, technique, combination, is, real, time, pcr, and, reverse, transcription, this, sophisticated, technique, called, rt, qpcr, allows, for, the, quantification, of, a, small, quantity, of, rna, through, this, combined, technique, mrna, is, converted, to, cdna, which, is, further, quantified, using, qpcr, this, technique, lowers, the, possibility, of, error, at, the, end, point, of, pcr, increasing, chances, for, detection, of, genes, associated, with, genetic, diseases, such, as, cancer, laboratories, use, rt, qpcr, for, the, purpose, of, sensitively, measuring, gene, regulation, the, mathematical, foundations, for, the, reliable, quantification, of, the, pcr, and, rt, qpcr, facilitate, the, implementation, of, accurate, fitting, procedures, of, experimental, data, in, research, medical, diagnostic, and, infectious, disease, applications, prospective, parents, can, be, tested, for, being, genetic, carriers, or, their, children, might, be, tested, for, actually, being, affected, by, a, disease, dna, samples, for, prenatal, testing, can, be, obtained, by, amniocentesis, chorionic, villus, sampling, or, even, by, the, analysis, of, rare, fetal, cells, circulating, in, the, mother, s, bloodstream, pcr, analysis, is, also, essential, to, preimplantation, genetic, diagnosis, where, individual, cells, of, a, developing, embryo, are, tested, for, mutations, pcr, allows, for, rapid, and, highly, specific, diagnosis, of, infectious, diseases, including, those, caused, by, bacteria, or, viruses, pcr, also, permits, identification, of, non, cultivatable, or, slow, growing, microorganisms, such, as, mycobacteria, anaerobic, bacteria, or, viruses, from, tissue, culture, assays, and, animal, models, the, basis, for, pcr, diagnostic, applications, in, microbiology, is, the, detection, of, infectious, agents, and, the, discrimination, of, non, pathogenic, from, pathogenic, strains, by, virtue, of, specific, genes, characterization, and, detection, of, infectious, disease, organisms, have, been, revolutionized, by, pcr, in, the, following, ways, the, development, of, pcr, based, genetic, or, dna, fingerprinting, protocols, has, seen, widespread, application, in, forensics, pcr, has, been, applied, to, many, areas, of, research, in, molecular, genetics, pcr, has, a, number, of, advantages, it, is, fairly, simple, to, understand, and, to, use, and, produces, results, rapidly, the, technique, is, highly, sensitive, with, the, potential, to, produce, millions, to, billions, of, copies, of, a, specific, product, for, sequencing, cloning, and, analysis, qrt, pcr, shares, the, same, advantages, as, the, pcr, with, an, added, advantage, of, quantification, of, the, synthesized, product, therefore, it, has, its, uses, to, analyze, alterations, of, gene, expression, levels, in, tumors, microbes, or, other, disease, states, pcr, is, a, very, powerful, and, practical, research, tool, the, sequencing, of, unknown, etiologies, of, many, diseases, are, being, figured, out, by, the, pcr, the, technique, can, help, identify, the, sequence, of, previously, unknown, viruses, related, to, those, already, known, and, thus, give, us, a, better, understanding, of, the, disease, itself, if, the, procedure, can, be, further, simplified, and, sensitive, non, radiometric, detection, systems, can, be, developed, the, pcr, will, assume, a, prominent, place, in, the, clinical, laboratory, for, years, to, come, one, major, limitation, of, pcr, is, that, prior, information, about, the, target, sequence, is, necessary, in, order, to, generate, the, primers, that, will, allow, its, selective, amplification, this, means, that, typically, pcr, users, must, know, the, precise, sequence, s, upstream, of, the, target, region, on, each, of, the, two, single, stranded, templates, in, order, to, ensure, that, the, dna, polymerase, properly, binds, to, the, primer, template, hybrids, and, subsequently, generates, the, entire, target, region, during, dna, synthesis, like, all, enzymes, dna, polymerases, are, also, prone, to, error, which, in, turn, causes, mutations, in, the, pcr, fragments, that, are, generated, another, limitation, of, pcr, is, that, even, the, smallest, amount, of, contaminating, dna, can, be, amplified, resulting, in, misleading, or, ambiguous, results, to, minimize, the, chance, of, contamination, investigators, should, reserve, separate, rooms, for, reagent, preparation, the, pcr, and, analysis, of, product, reagents, should, be, dispensed, into, single, use, aliquots, pipettors, with, disposable, plungers, and, extra, long, pipette, tips, should, be, routinely, used, it, is, moreover, recommended, to, ensure, that, the, lab, set, up, follows, a, unidirectional, workflow, no, materials, or, reagents, used, in, the, pcr, and, analysis, rooms, should, ever, be, taken, into, the, pcr, preparation, room, without, thorough, decontamination, environmental, samples, that, contain, humic, acids, may, inhibit, pcr, amplification, and, lead, to, inaccurate, results, the, heat, resistant, enzymes, that, are, a, key, component, in, polymerase, chain, reaction, were, discovered, in, the, 1960s, as, a, product, of, a, microbial, life, form, that, lived, in, the, superheated, waters, of, yellowstone, s, mushroom, spring, a, 1971, paper, in, the, journal, of, molecular, biology, by, kjell, kleppe, and, co, workers, in, the, laboratory, of, h, gobind, khorana, first, described, a, method, of, using, an, enzymatic, assay, to, replicate, a, short, dna, template, with, primers, in, vitro, however, this, early, manifestation, of, the, basic, pcr, principle, did, not, receive, much, attention, at, the, time, and, the, invention, of, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, in, 1983, is, generally, credited, to, kary, mullis, when, mullis, developed, the, pcr, in, 1983, he, was, working, in, emeryville, california, for, cetus, corporation, one, of, the, first, biotechnology, companies, where, he, was, responsible, for, synthesizing, short, chains, of, dna, mullis, has, written, that, he, conceived, the, idea, for, pcr, while, cruising, along, the, pacific, coast, highway, one, night, in, his, car, he, was, playing, in, his, mind, with, a, new, way, of, analyzing, changes, mutations, in, dna, when, he, realized, that, he, had, instead, invented, a, method, of, amplifying, any, dna, region, through, repeated, cycles, of, duplication, driven, by, dna, polymerase, in, scientific, american, mullis, summarized, the, procedure, beginning, with, a, single, molecule, of, the, genetic, material, dna, the, pcr, can, generate, 100, billion, similar, molecules, in, an, afternoon, the, reaction, is, easy, to, execute, it, requires, no, more, than, a, test, tube, a, few, simple, reagents, and, a, source, of, heat, dna, fingerprinting, was, first, used, for, paternity, testing, in, 1988, mullis, has, credited, his, use, of, lsd, as, integral, to, his, development, of, pcr, would, i, have, invented, pcr, if, i, hadn, t, taken, lsd, i, seriously, doubt, it, i, could, sit, on, a, dna, molecule, and, watch, the, polymers, go, by, i, learnt, that, partly, on, psychedelic, drugs, mullis, and, biochemist, michael, smith, who, had, developed, other, essential, ways, of, manipulating, dna, were, jointly, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1993, seven, years, after, mullis, and, his, colleagues, at, cetus, first, put, his, proposal, to, practice, mullis, s, 1985, paper, with, r, k, saiki, and, h, a, erlich, enzymatic, amplification, of, globin, genomic, sequences, and, restriction, site, analysis, for, diagnosis, of, sickle, cell, anemia, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, invention, pcr, was, honored, by, a, citation, for, chemical, breakthrough, award, from, the, division, of, history, of, chemistry, of, the, american, chemical, society, in, 2017, at, the, core, of, the, pcr, method, is, the, use, of, a, suitable, dna, polymerase, able, to, withstand, the, high, temperatures, of, 90, c, 194, f, required, for, separation, of, the, two, dna, strands, in, the, dna, double, helix, after, each, replication, cycle, the, dna, polymerases, initially, employed, for, in, vitro, experiments, presaging, pcr, were, unable, to, withstand, these, high, temperatures, so, the, early, procedures, for, dna, replication, were, very, inefficient, and, time, consuming, and, required, large, amounts, of, dna, polymerase, and, continuous, handling, throughout, the, process, the, discovery, in, 1976, of, taq, polymerase, a, dna, polymerase, purified, from, the, thermophilic, bacterium, thermus, aquaticus, which, naturally, lives, in, hot, 50, to, 80, c, 122, to, 176, f, environments, such, as, hot, springs, paved, the, way, for, dramatic, improvements, of, the, pcr, method, the, dna, polymerase, isolated, from, t, aquaticus, is, stable, at, high, temperatures, remaining, active, even, after, dna, denaturation, thus, obviating, the, need, to, add, new, dna, polymerase, after, each, cycle, this, allowed, an, automated, thermocycler, based, process, for, dna, amplification, the, pcr, technique, was, patented, by, kary, mullis, and, assigned, to, cetus, corporation, where, mullis, worked, when, he, invented, the, technique, in, 1983, the, taq, polymerase, enzyme, was, also, covered, by, patents, there, have, been, several, high, profile, lawsuits, related, to, the, technique, including, an, unsuccessful, lawsuit, brought, by, dupont, the, swiss, pharmaceutical, company, hoffmann, la, roche, purchased, the, rights, to, the, patents, in, 1992, the, last, of, the, commercial, pcr, patents, expired, in, 2017, a, related, patent, battle, over, the, taq, polymerase, enzyme, is, still, ongoing, in, several, jurisdictions, around, the, world, between, roche, and, promega, the, legal, arguments, have, extended, beyond, the, lives, of, the, original, pcr, and, taq, polymerase, patents, which, expired, on, 28, march, 2005
