study, of, circular, processes, such, as, feedback, systems, where, outputs, are, also, inputs, it, is, concerned, with, general, principles, that, are, relevant, across, multiple, contexts, including, in, ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and, social, systems, and, also, in, practical, activities, such, as, designing, learning, and, managing, the, field, is, named, after, an, example, of, circular, causal, feedback, that, of, steering, a, ship, the, ancient, greek, kybern, t, s, means, helmsperson, in, steering, a, ship, the, helmsperson, adjusts, their, steering, in, continual, response, to, the, effect, it, is, observed, as, having, forming, a, feedback, loop, through, which, a, steady, course, can, be, maintained, in, a, changing, environment, responding, to, disturbances, from, cross, winds, and, tide, cybernetics, transdisciplinary, character, has, meant, that, it, intersects, with, a, number, of, other, fields, leading, to, it, having, both, wide, influence, and, diverse, interpretations, cybernetics, has, been, defined, in, a, variety, of, ways, reflecting, the, richness, of, its, conceptual, base, one, of, the, best, known, definitions, is, that, of, the, american, scientist, norbert, wiener, who, characterised, cybernetics, as, concerned, with, control, and, communication, in, the, animal, and, the, machine, another, early, definition, is, that, of, the, macy, cybernetics, conferences, where, cybernetics, was, understood, as, the, study, of, circular, causal, and, feedback, mechanisms, in, biological, and, social, systems, margaret, mead, emphasised, the, role, of, cybernetics, as, a, form, of, cross, disciplinary, thought, which, made, it, possible, for, members, of, many, disciplines, to, communicate, with, each, other, easily, in, a, language, which, all, could, understand, other, definitions, include, the, art, of, governing, or, the, science, of, government, andr, marie, amp, re, the, art, of, steersmanship, ross, ashby, the, study, of, systems, of, any, nature, which, are, capable, of, receiving, storing, and, processing, information, so, as, to, use, it, for, control, andrey, kolmogorov, and, a, branch, of, mathematics, dealing, with, problems, of, control, recursiveness, and, information, focuses, on, forms, and, the, patterns, that, connect, gregory, bateson, the, ancient, greek, term, kubern, tikos, good, at, steering, appears, in, plato, s, republic, and, alcibiades, where, the, metaphor, of, a, steersman, is, used, to, signify, the, governance, of, people, the, french, word, cybern, tique, was, also, used, in, 1834, by, the, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, to, denote, the, sciences, of, government, in, his, classification, system, of, human, knowledge, according, to, norbert, wiener, the, word, cybernetics, was, coined, by, a, research, group, involving, himself, and, arturo, rosenblueth, in, the, summer, of, 1947, it, has, been, attested, in, print, since, at, least, 1948, through, wiener, s, book, cybernetics, or, control, and, communication, in, the, animal, and, the, machine, in, the, book, wiener, states, after, much, consideration, we, have, come, to, the, conclusion, that, all, the, existing, terminology, has, too, heavy, a, bias, to, one, side, or, another, to, serve, the, future, development, of, the, field, as, well, as, it, should, and, as, happens, so, often, to, scientists, we, have, been, forced, to, coin, at, least, one, artificial, neo, greek, expression, to, fill, the, gap, we, have, decided, to, call, the, entire, field, of, control, and, communication, theory, whether, in, the, machine, or, in, the, animal, by, the, name, cybernetics, which, we, form, from, the, greek, or, steersman, moreover, wiener, explains, the, term, was, chosen, to, recognize, james, clerk, maxwell, s, 1868, publication, on, feedback, mechanisms, involving, governors, noting, that, the, term, governor, is, also, derived, from, kubern, t, s, via, a, latin, corruption, gubernator, finally, wiener, motivates, the, choice, by, steering, engines, of, a, ship, being, one, of, the, earliest, and, best, developed, forms, of, feedback, mechanisms, the, initial, focus, of, cybernetics, was, on, parallels, between, regulatory, feedback, processes, in, biological, and, technological, systems, two, foundational, articles, were, published, in, 1943, behavior, purpose, and, teleology, by, arturo, rosenblueth, norbert, wiener, and, julian, bigelow, based, on, the, research, on, living, organisms, that, rosenblueth, did, in, mexico, and, the, paper, a, logical, calculus, of, the, ideas, immanent, in, nervous, activity, by, warren, mcculloch, and, walter, pitts, the, foundations, of, cybernetics, were, then, developed, through, a, series, of, transdisciplinary, conferences, funded, by, the, josiah, macy, jr, foundation, between, 1946, and, 1953, the, conferences, were, chaired, by, mcculloch, and, had, participants, included, ross, ashby, gregory, bateson, heinz, von, foerster, margaret, mead, john, von, neumann, and, norbert, wiener, in, the, uk, similar, focuses, were, explored, by, the, ratio, club, an, informal, dining, club, of, young, psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, mathematicians, and, engineers, that, met, between, 1949, and, 1958, wiener, introduced, the, neologism, cybernetics, to, denote, the, study, of, teleological, mechanisms, and, popularized, it, through, the, book, cybernetics, or, control, and, communication, in, the, animal, and, the, machine, during, the, 1950s, cybernetics, was, developed, as, a, primarily, technical, discipline, such, as, in, qian, xuesen, s, 1954, engineering, cybernetics, in, the, soviet, union, cybernetics, was, initially, considered, with, suspicion, but, became, accepted, from, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, however, cybernetics, transdisciplinarity, fragmented, with, technical, focuses, separating, into, separate, fields, artificial, intelligence, ai, was, founded, as, a, distinct, discipline, at, the, dartmouth, workshop, in, 1956, differentiating, itself, from, the, broader, cybernetics, field, after, some, uneasy, coexistence, ai, gained, funding, and, prominence, consequently, cybernetic, sciences, such, as, the, study, of, artificial, neural, networks, were, downplayed, similarly, computer, science, became, defined, as, a, distinct, academic, discipline, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, second, wave, of, cybernetics, came, to, prominence, from, the, 1960s, onwards, with, its, focus, inflecting, away, from, technology, toward, social, ecological, and, philosophical, concerns, it, was, still, grounded, in, biology, notably, maturana, and, varela, s, autopoiesis, and, built, on, earlier, work, on, self, organising, systems, and, the, presence, of, anthropologists, mead, and, bateson, in, the, macy, meetings, the, biological, computer, laboratory, founded, in, 1958, and, active, until, the, mid, 1970s, under, the, direction, of, heinz, von, foerster, at, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, was, a, major, incubator, of, this, trend, in, cybernetics, research, focuses, of, the, second, wave, of, cybernetics, included, management, cybernetics, such, as, stafford, beer, s, biologically, inspired, viable, system, model, work, in, family, therapy, drawing, on, bateson, social, systems, such, as, in, the, work, of, niklas, luhmann, epistemology, and, pedagogy, such, as, in, the, development, of, radical, constructivism, cybernetics, core, theme, of, circular, causality, was, developed, beyond, goal, oriented, processes, to, concerns, with, reflexivity, and, recursion, this, was, especially, so, in, the, development, of, second, order, cybernetics, or, the, cybernetics, of, cybernetics, developed, and, promoted, by, heinz, von, foerster, which, focused, on, questions, of, observation, cognition, epistemology, and, ethics, the, 1960s, onwards, also, saw, cybernetics, begin, to, develop, exchanges, with, the, creative, arts, design, and, architecture, notably, with, the, cybernetic, serendipity, exhibition, ica, london, 1968, curated, by, jasia, reichardt, and, the, unrealised, fun, palace, project, london, unrealised, 1964, onwards, where, gordon, pask, was, consultant, to, architect, cedric, price, and, theatre, director, joan, littlewood, from, the, 1990s, onwards, there, has, been, a, renewed, interest, in, cybernetics, from, a, number, of, directions, early, cybernetic, work, on, artificial, neural, networks, has, been, returned, to, as, a, paradigm, in, machine, learning, and, artificial, intelligence, the, entanglements, of, society, with, emerging, technologies, has, led, to, exchanges, with, feminist, technoscience, and, posthumanism, re, examinations, of, cybernetics, history, have, seen, science, studies, scholars, emphasising, cybernetics, unusual, qualities, as, a, science, such, as, its, performative, ontology, practical, design, disciplines, have, drawn, on, cybernetics, for, theoretical, underpinning, and, transdisciplinary, connections, emerging, topics, include, how, cybernetics, engagements, with, social, human, and, ecological, contexts, might, come, together, with, its, earlier, technological, focus, whether, as, a, critical, discourse, or, a, new, branch, of, engineering, the, central, theme, in, cybernetics, is, feedback, feedback, is, a, process, where, the, observed, outcomes, of, actions, are, taken, as, inputs, for, further, action, in, ways, that, support, the, pursuit, maintenance, or, disruption, of, particular, conditions, forming, a, circular, causal, relationship, in, steering, a, ship, the, helmsperson, maintains, a, steady, course, in, a, changing, environment, by, adjusting, their, steering, in, continual, response, to, the, effect, it, is, observed, as, having, other, examples, of, circular, causal, feedback, include, technological, devices, such, as, the, thermostat, where, the, action, of, a, heater, responds, to, measured, changes, in, temperature, regulating, the, temperature, of, the, room, within, a, set, range, and, the, centrifugal, governor, of, a, steam, engine, which, regulates, the, engine, speed, biological, examples, such, as, the, coordination, of, volitional, movement, through, the, nervous, system, and, the, homeostatic, processes, that, regulate, variables, such, as, blood, sugar, and, processes, of, social, interaction, such, as, conversation, negative, feedback, processes, are, those, that, maintain, particular, conditions, by, reducing, hence, negative, the, difference, from, a, desired, state, such, as, where, a, thermostat, turns, on, a, heater, when, it, is, too, cold, and, turns, a, heater, off, when, it, is, too, hot, positive, feedback, processes, increase, hence, positive, the, difference, from, a, desired, state, an, example, of, positive, feedback, is, when, a, microphone, picks, up, the, sound, that, it, is, producing, through, a, speaker, which, is, then, played, through, the, speaker, and, so, on, in, addition, to, feedback, cybernetics, is, concerned, with, other, forms, of, circular, processes, including, feedforward, recursion, and, reflexivity, other, key, concepts, and, theories, in, cybernetics, include, cybernetics, central, concept, of, circular, causality, is, of, wide, applicability, leading, to, diverse, applications, and, relations, with, other, fields, many, of, the, initial, applications, of, cybernetics, focused, on, engineering, biology, and, exchanges, between, the, two, such, as, medical, cybernetics, and, robotics, and, topics, such, as, neural, networks, heterarchy, in, the, social, and, behavioral, sciences, cybernetics, has, included, and, influenced, work, in, anthropology, sociology, economics, family, therapy, cognitive, science, and, psychology, as, cybernetics, has, developed, it, broadened, in, scope, to, include, work, in, management, design, pedagogy, and, the, creative, arts, while, also, developing, exchanges, with, constructivist, philosophies, counter, cultural, movements, and, media, studies, the, development, of, management, cybernetics, has, led, to, a, variety, of, applications, notably, to, the, national, economy, of, chile, under, the, allende, government, in, project, cybersyn, in, design, cybernetics, has, been, influential, on, interactive, architecture, human, computer, interaction, design, research, and, the, development, of, systemic, design, and, metadesign, practices, cybernetics, is, often, understood, within, the, context, of, systems, science, systems, theory, and, systems, thinking, systems, approaches, influenced, by, cybernetics, include, critical, systems, thinking, which, incorporates, the, viable, system, model, systemic, design, and, system, dynamics, which, is, based, on, the, concept, of, causal, feedback, loops, many, fields, trace, their, origins, in, whole, or, part, to, work, carried, out, in, cybernetics, or, were, partially, absorbed, into, cybernetics, when, it, was, developed, these, include, artificial, intelligence, bionics, cognitive, science, control, theory, complexity, science, computer, science, information, theory, and, robotics, some, aspects, of, modern, artificial, intelligence, particularly, the, social, machine, are, often, described, in, cybernetic, terms, academic, journals, with, focuses, in, cybernetics, include, academic, societies, primarily, concerned, with, cybernetics, or, aspects, of, it, include
