https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome
a, dome, from, latin, domus, is, an, architectural, element, similar, to, the, hollow, upper, half, of, a, sphere, there, is, significant, overlap, with, the, term, cupola, which, may, also, refer, to, a, dome, or, a, structure, on, top, of, a, dome, the, precise, definition, of, a, dome, has, been, a, matter, of, controversy, and, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, forms, and, specialized, terms, to, describe, them, a, dome, can, rest, directly, upon, a, rotunda, wall, a, drum, or, a, system, of, squinches, or, pendentives, used, to, accommodate, the, transition, in, shape, from, a, rectangular, or, square, space, to, the, round, or, polygonal, base, of, the, dome, the, dome, s, apex, may, be, closed, or, may, be, open, in, the, form, of, an, oculus, which, may, itself, be, covered, with, a, roof, lantern, and, cupola, domes, have, a, long, architectural, lineage, that, extends, back, into, prehistory, domes, were, built, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, they, have, been, found, in, persian, hellenistic, roman, and, chinese, architecture, in, the, ancient, world, as, well, as, among, a, number, of, indigenous, building, traditions, throughout, the, world, dome, structures, were, common, in, both, byzantine, architecture, and, sasanian, architecture, which, influenced, that, of, the, rest, of, europe, and, islam, respectively, in, the, middle, ages, the, domes, of, european, renaissance, architecture, spread, from, italy, in, the, early, modern, period, while, domes, were, frequently, employed, in, ottoman, architecture, at, the, same, time, baroque, and, neoclassical, architecture, took, inspiration, from, roman, domes, advancements, in, mathematics, materials, and, production, techniques, resulted, in, new, dome, types, domes, have, been, constructed, over, the, centuries, from, mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and, plastic, the, symbolism, associated, with, domes, includes, mortuary, celestial, and, governmental, traditions, that, have, likewise, altered, over, time, the, domes, of, the, modern, world, can, be, found, over, religious, buildings, legislative, chambers, sports, stadiums, and, a, variety, of, functional, structures, the, english, word, dome, ultimately, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, and, latin, domus, house, which, up, through, the, renaissance, labeled, a, revered, house, such, as, a, domus, dei, or, house, of, god, regardless, of, the, shape, of, its, roof, this, is, reflected, in, the, uses, of, the, italian, word, duomo, the, german, icelandic, danish, word, dom, cathedral, and, the, english, word, dome, as, late, as, 1656, when, it, meant, a, town, house, guild, hall, state, house, and, meeting, house, in, a, city, the, french, word, dosme, came, to, acquire, the, meaning, of, a, cupola, vault, specifically, by, 1660, this, french, definition, gradually, became, the, standard, usage, of, the, english, dome, in, the, eighteenth, century, as, many, of, the, most, impressive, houses, of, god, were, built, with, monumental, domes, and, in, response, to, the, scientific, need, for, more, technical, terms, across, the, ancient, world, curved, roof, structures, that, would, today, be, called, domes, had, a, number, of, different, names, reflecting, a, variety, of, shapes, traditions, and, symbolic, associations, the, shapes, were, derived, from, traditions, of, pre, historic, shelters, made, from, various, impermanent, pliable, materials, and, were, only, later, reproduced, as, vaulting, in, more, durable, materials, the, hemispherical, shape, often, associated, with, domes, today, derives, from, greek, geometry, and, roman, standardization, but, other, shapes, persisted, including, a, pointed, and, bulbous, tradition, inherited, by, some, early, islamic, mosques, modern, academic, study, of, the, topic, has, been, controversial, and, confused, by, inconsistent, definitions, such, as, those, for, cloister, vaults, and, domical, vaults, dictionary, definitions, of, the, term, dome, are, often, general, and, imprecise, generally, speaking, it, is, non, specific, a, blanket, word, to, describe, an, hemispherical, or, similar, spanning, element, published, definitions, include, hemispherical, roofs, alone, revolved, arches, and, vaults, on, a, circular, base, alone, circular, or, polygonal, base, circular, elliptical, or, polygonal, base, or, an, undefined, area, definitions, specifying, vertical, sections, include, semicircular, pointed, or, bulbous, semicircular, segmental, or, pointed, semicircular, segmental, pointed, or, bulbous, semicircular, segmental, elliptical, or, bulbous, and, high, profile, hemispherical, or, flattened, sometimes, called, false, domes, corbel, domes, achieve, their, shape, by, extending, each, horizontal, layer, of, stones, inward, slightly, farther, than, the, lower, one, until, they, meet, at, the, top, a, false, dome, may, also, refer, to, a, wooden, dome, the, italian, use, of, the, term, finto, meaning, false, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 17th, century, in, the, use, of, vaulting, made, of, reed, mats, and, gypsum, mortar, true, domes, are, said, to, be, those, whose, structure, is, in, a, state, of, compression, with, constituent, elements, of, wedge, shaped, voussoirs, the, joints, of, which, align, with, a, central, point, the, validity, of, this, is, unclear, as, domes, built, underground, with, corbelled, stone, layers, are, in, compression, from, the, surrounding, earth, the, precise, definition, of, pendentive, has, also, been, a, source, of, academic, contention, such, as, whether, or, not, corbelling, is, permitted, under, the, definition, and, whether, or, not, the, lower, portions, of, a, sail, vault, should, be, considered, pendentives, domes, with, pendentives, can, be, divided, into, two, kinds, simple, and, compound, in, the, case, of, the, simple, dome, the, pendentives, are, part, of, the, same, sphere, as, the, dome, itself, however, such, domes, are, rare, in, the, case, of, the, more, common, compound, dome, the, pendentives, are, part, of, the, surface, of, a, larger, sphere, below, that, of, the, dome, itself, and, form, a, circular, base, for, either, the, dome, or, a, drum, section, the, fields, of, engineering, and, architecture, have, lacked, common, language, for, domes, with, engineering, focused, on, structural, behavior, and, architecture, focused, on, form, and, symbolism, additionally, new, materials, and, structural, systems, in, the, 20th, century, have, allowed, for, large, dome, shaped, structures, that, deviate, from, the, traditional, compressive, structural, behavior, of, masonry, domes, popular, usage, of, the, term, has, expanded, to, mean, almost, any, long, span, roofing, system, the, word, cupola, is, another, word, for, dome, and, is, usually, used, for, a, small, dome, upon, a, roof, or, turret, cupola, has, also, been, used, to, describe, the, inner, side, of, a, dome, the, top, of, a, dome, is, the, crown, the, inner, side, of, a, dome, is, called, the, intrados, and, the, outer, side, is, called, the, extrados, as, with, arches, the, springing, of, a, dome, is, the, base, level, from, which, the, dome, rises, and, the, haunch, is, the, part, that, lies, roughly, halfway, between, the, base, and, the, top, domes, can, be, supported, by, an, elliptical, or, circular, wall, called, a, drum, if, this, structure, extends, to, ground, level, the, round, building, may, be, called, a, rotunda, drums, are, also, called, tholobates, and, may, or, may, not, contain, windows, a, tambour, or, lantern, is, the, equivalent, structure, over, a, dome, s, oculus, supporting, a, cupola, when, the, base, of, the, dome, does, not, match, the, plan, of, the, supporting, walls, beneath, it, for, example, a, dome, s, circular, base, over, a, square, bay, techniques, are, employed, to, bridge, the, two, one, technique, is, to, use, corbelling, progressively, projecting, horizontal, layers, from, the, top, of, the, supporting, wall, to, the, base, of, the, dome, such, as, the, corbelled, triangles, often, used, in, seljuk, and, ottoman, architecture, the, simplest, technique, is, to, use, diagonal, lintels, across, the, corners, of, the, walls, to, create, an, octagonal, base, another, is, to, use, arches, to, span, the, corners, which, can, support, more, weight, a, variety, of, these, techniques, use, what, are, called, squinches, a, squinch, can, be, a, single, arch, or, a, set, of, multiple, projecting, nested, arches, placed, diagonally, over, an, internal, corner, squinch, forms, also, include, trumpet, arches, niche, heads, or, half, domes, trumpet, arches, with, anteposed, arches, and, muqarnas, arches, squinches, transfer, the, weight, of, a, dome, across, the, gaps, created, by, the, corners, and, into, the, walls, pendentives, are, triangular, sections, of, a, sphere, like, concave, spandrels, between, arches, and, transition, from, the, corners, of, a, square, bay, to, the, circular, base, of, a, dome, the, curvature, of, the, pendentives, is, that, of, a, sphere, with, a, diameter, equal, to, the, diagonal, of, the, square, bay, pendentives, concentrate, the, weight, of, a, dome, into, the, corners, of, the, bay, the, earliest, domes, in, the, middle, east, were, built, with, mud, brick, and, eventually, with, baked, brick, and, stone, domes, of, wood, allowed, for, wide, spans, due, to, the, relatively, light, and, flexible, nature, of, the, material, and, were, the, normal, method, for, domed, churches, by, the, 7th, century, although, most, domes, were, built, with, the, other, less, flexible, materials, wooden, domes, were, protected, from, the, weather, by, roofing, such, as, copper, or, lead, sheeting, domes, of, cut, stone, were, more, expensive, and, never, as, large, and, timber, was, used, for, large, spans, where, brick, was, unavailable, roman, concrete, used, an, aggregate, of, stone, with, a, powerful, mortar, the, aggregate, transitioned, over, the, centuries, to, pieces, of, fired, clay, then, to, roman, bricks, by, the, sixth, century, bricks, with, large, amounts, of, mortar, were, the, principle, vaulting, materials, pozzolana, appears, to, have, only, been, used, in, central, italy, brick, domes, were, the, favored, choice, for, large, space, monumental, coverings, until, the, industrial, age, due, to, their, convenience, and, dependability, ties, and, chains, of, iron, or, wood, could, be, used, to, resist, stresses, in, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, domes, and, drums, constructed, from, mud, brick, and, baked, brick, were, sometimes, covered, with, brittle, ceramic, tiles, on, the, exterior, to, protect, against, rain, and, snow, the, new, building, materials, of, the, 19th, century, and, a, better, understanding, of, the, forces, within, structures, from, the, 20th, century, opened, up, new, possibilities, iron, and, steel, beams, steel, cables, and, pre, stressed, concrete, eliminated, the, need, for, external, buttressing, and, enabled, much, thinner, domes, whereas, earlier, masonry, domes, may, have, had, a, radius, to, thickness, ratio, of, 50, the, ratio, for, modern, domes, can, be, in, excess, of, 800, the, lighter, weight, of, these, domes, not, only, permitted, far, greater, spans, but, also, allowed, for, the, creation, of, large, movable, domes, over, modern, sports, stadiums, experimental, rammed, earth, domes, were, made, as, part, of, work, on, sustainable, architecture, at, the, university, of, kassel, in, 1983, a, masonry, dome, produces, thrusts, downward, and, outward, they, are, thought, of, in, terms, of, two, kinds, of, forces, at, right, angles, from, one, another, meridional, forces, like, the, meridians, or, lines, of, longitude, on, a, globe, are, compressive, only, and, increase, towards, the, base, while, hoop, forces, like, the, lines, of, latitude, on, a, globe, are, in, compression, at, the, top, and, tension, at, the, base, with, the, transition, in, a, hemispherical, dome, occurring, at, an, angle, of, 51, 8, degrees, from, the, top, the, thrusts, generated, by, a, dome, are, directly, proportional, to, the, weight, of, its, materials, grounded, hemispherical, domes, generate, significant, horizontal, thrusts, at, their, haunches, the, outward, thrusts, in, the, lower, portion, of, a, hemispherical, masonry, dome, can, be, counteracted, with, the, use, of, chains, incorporated, around, the, circumference, or, with, external, buttressing, although, cracking, along, the, meridians, is, natural, for, small, or, tall, domes, with, less, horizontal, thrust, the, thickness, of, the, supporting, arches, or, walls, can, be, enough, to, resist, deformation, which, is, why, drums, tend, to, be, much, thicker, than, the, domes, they, support, unlike, voussoir, arches, which, require, support, for, each, element, until, the, keystone, is, in, place, domes, are, stable, during, construction, as, each, level, is, made, a, complete, and, self, supporting, ring, the, upper, portion, of, a, masonry, dome, is, always, in, compression, and, is, supported, laterally, so, it, does, not, collapse, except, as, a, whole, unit, and, a, range, of, deviations, from, the, ideal, in, this, shallow, upper, cap, are, equally, stable, because, voussoir, domes, have, lateral, support, they, can, be, made, much, thinner, than, corresponding, arches, of, the, same, span, for, example, a, hemispherical, dome, can, be, 2, 5, times, thinner, than, a, semicircular, arch, and, a, dome, with, the, profile, of, an, equilateral, arch, can, be, thinner, still, the, optimal, shape, for, a, masonry, dome, of, equal, thickness, provides, for, perfect, compression, with, none, of, the, tension, or, bending, forces, against, which, masonry, is, weak, for, a, particular, material, the, optimal, dome, geometry, is, called, the, funicular, surface, the, comparable, shape, in, three, dimensions, to, a, catenary, curve, for, a, two, dimensional, arch, adding, a, weight, to, the, top, of, a, pointed, dome, such, as, the, heavy, cupola, at, the, top, of, florence, cathedral, changes, the, optimal, shape, to, more, closely, match, the, actual, pointed, shape, of, the, dome, the, pointed, profiles, of, many, gothic, domes, more, closely, approximate, the, optimal, dome, shape, than, do, hemispheres, which, were, favored, by, roman, and, byzantine, architects, due, to, the, circle, being, considered, the, most, perfect, of, forms, according, to, e, baldwin, smith, from, the, late, stone, age, the, dome, shaped, tomb, was, used, as, a, reproduction, of, the, ancestral, god, given, shelter, made, permanent, as, a, venerated, home, of, the, dead, the, instinctive, desire, to, do, this, resulted, in, widespread, domical, mortuary, traditions, across, the, ancient, world, from, the, stupas, of, india, to, the, tholos, tombs, of, iberia, by, hellenistic, and, roman, times, the, domical, tholos, had, become, the, customary, cemetery, symbol, domes, and, tent, canopies, were, also, associated, with, the, heavens, in, ancient, persia, and, the, hellenistic, roman, world, a, dome, over, a, square, base, reflected, the, geometric, symbolism, of, those, shapes, the, circle, represented, perfection, eternity, and, the, heavens, the, square, represented, the, earth, an, octagon, was, intermediate, between, the, two, the, distinct, symbolism, of, the, heavenly, or, cosmic, tent, stemming, from, the, royal, audience, tents, of, achaemenid, and, indian, rulers, was, adopted, by, roman, rulers, in, imitation, of, alexander, the, great, becoming, the, imperial, baldachin, this, probably, began, with, nero, whose, golden, house, also, made, the, dome, a, feature, of, palace, architecture, the, dual, sepulchral, and, heavenly, symbolism, was, adopted, by, early, christians, in, both, the, use, of, domes, in, architecture, and, in, the, ciborium, a, domical, canopy, like, the, baldachin, used, as, a, ritual, covering, for, relics, or, the, church, altar, the, celestial, symbolism, of, the, dome, however, was, the, preeminent, one, by, the, christian, era, in, the, early, centuries, of, islam, domes, were, closely, associated, with, royalty, a, dome, built, in, front, of, the, mihrab, of, a, mosque, for, example, was, at, least, initially, meant, to, emphasize, the, place, of, a, prince, during, royal, ceremonies, over, time, such, domes, became, primarily, focal, points, for, decoration, or, the, direction, of, prayer, the, use, of, domes, in, mausoleums, can, likewise, reflect, royal, patronage, or, be, seen, as, representing, the, honor, and, prestige, that, domes, symbolized, rather, than, having, any, specific, funerary, meaning, the, wide, variety, of, dome, forms, in, medieval, islam, reflected, dynastic, religious, and, social, differences, as, much, as, practical, building, considerations, because, domes, are, concave, from, below, they, can, reflect, sound, and, create, echoes, a, dome, may, have, a, whispering, gallery, at, its, base, that, at, certain, places, transmits, distinct, sound, to, other, distant, places, in, the, gallery, the, half, domes, over, the, apses, of, byzantine, churches, helped, to, project, the, chants, of, the, clergy, although, this, can, complement, music, it, may, make, speech, less, intelligible, leading, francesco, giorgi, in, 1535, to, recommend, vaulted, ceilings, for, the, choir, areas, of, a, church, but, a, flat, ceiling, filled, with, as, many, coffers, as, possible, for, where, preaching, would, occur, cavities, in, the, form, of, jars, built, into, the, inner, surface, of, a, dome, may, serve, to, compensate, for, this, interference, by, diffusing, sound, in, all, directions, eliminating, echoes, while, creating, a, divine, effect, in, the, atmosphere, of, worship, this, technique, was, written, about, by, vitruvius, in, his, ten, books, on, architecture, which, describes, bronze, and, earthenware, resonators, the, material, shape, contents, and, placement, of, these, cavity, resonators, determine, the, effect, they, have, reinforcing, certain, frequencies, or, absorbing, them, also, called, a, corbelled, dome, cribbed, dome, or, false, dome, these, are, different, from, a, true, dome, in, that, they, consist, of, purely, horizontal, layers, as, the, layers, get, higher, each, is, slightly, cantilevered, or, corbeled, toward, the, center, until, meeting, at, the, top, a, monumental, example, is, the, mycenaean, treasury, of, atreus, from, the, late, bronze, age, a, single, or, double, layer, space, frame, in, the, form, of, a, dome, a, braced, dome, is, a, generic, term, that, includes, ribbed, schwedler, three, way, grid, lamella, or, kiewitt, lattice, and, geodesic, domes, the, different, terms, reflect, different, arrangements, in, the, surface, members, braced, domes, often, have, a, very, low, weight, and, are, usually, used, to, cover, spans, of, up, to, 150, meters, often, prefabricated, their, component, members, can, either, lie, on, the, dome, s, surface, of, revolution, or, be, straight, lengths, with, the, connecting, points, or, nodes, lying, upon, the, surface, of, revolution, single, layer, structures, are, called, frame, or, skeleton, types, and, double, layer, structures, are, truss, types, which, are, used, for, large, spans, when, the, covering, also, forms, part, of, the, structural, system, it, is, called, a, stressed, skin, type, the, formed, surface, type, consists, of, sheets, joined, at, bent, edges, to, form, the, structure, also, called, domical, vaults, a, term, sometimes, also, applied, to, sail, vaults, polygonal, domes, coved, domes, gored, domes, segmental, domes, a, term, sometimes, also, used, for, saucer, domes, paneled, vaults, or, pavilion, vaults, these, are, domes, that, maintain, a, polygonal, shape, in, their, horizontal, cross, section, the, component, curved, surfaces, of, these, vaults, are, called, severies, webs, or, cells, the, earliest, known, examples, date, to, the, first, century, bc, such, as, the, tabularium, of, rome, from, 78, bc, others, include, the, baths, of, antoninus, in, carthage, 145, 160, and, the, palatine, chapel, at, aachen, 13th, 14th, century, the, most, famous, example, is, the, renaissance, octagonal, dome, of, filippo, brunelleschi, over, the, florence, cathedral, thomas, jefferson, the, third, president, of, the, united, states, installed, an, octagonal, dome, above, the, west, front, of, his, plantation, house, monticello, also, called, domes, on, pendentives, or, pendentive, domes, a, term, also, applied, to, sail, vaults, compound, domes, have, pendentives, that, support, a, smaller, diameter, dome, immediately, above, them, as, in, the, hagia, sophia, or, a, drum, and, dome, as, in, many, renaissance, and, post, renaissance, domes, with, both, forms, resulting, in, greater, height, one, of, the, earliest, types, of, ribbed, vault, the, first, known, examples, are, found, in, the, great, mosque, of, c, rdoba, in, the, 10th, century, rather, than, meeting, in, the, center, of, the, dome, the, ribs, characteristically, intersect, one, another, off, center, forming, an, empty, polygonal, space, in, the, center, geometry, is, a, key, element, of, the, designs, with, the, octagon, being, perhaps, the, most, popular, shape, used, whether, the, arches, are, structural, or, purely, decorative, remains, a, matter, of, debate, the, type, may, have, an, eastern, origin, although, the, issue, is, also, unsettled, examples, are, found, in, spain, north, africa, armenia, iran, france, and, italy, the, ellipsoidal, dome, is, a, surface, formed, by, the, rotation, around, a, vertical, axis, of, a, semi, ellipse, like, other, rotational, domes, formed, by, the, rotation, of, a, curve, around, a, vertical, axis, ellipsoidal, domes, have, circular, bases, and, horizontal, sections, and, are, a, type, of, circular, dome, for, that, reason, geodesic, domes, are, the, upper, portion, of, geodesic, spheres, they, are, composed, of, a, framework, of, triangles, in, a, polyhedron, pattern, the, structures, are, named, for, geodesics, and, are, based, upon, geometric, shapes, such, as, icosahedrons, octahedrons, or, tetrahedrons, such, domes, can, be, created, using, a, limited, number, of, simple, elements, and, joints, and, efficiently, resolve, a, dome, s, internal, forces, their, efficiency, is, said, to, increase, with, size, although, not, first, invented, by, buckminster, fuller, they, are, associated, with, him, because, he, designed, many, geodesic, domes, and, patented, them, in, the, united, states, the, hemispherical, dome, is, a, surface, formed, by, the, rotation, around, a, vertical, axis, of, a, semicircle, like, other, rotational, domes, formed, by, the, rotation, of, a, curve, around, a, vertical, axis, hemispherical, domes, have, circular, bases, and, horizontal, sections, and, are, a, type, of, circular, dome, for, that, reason, they, experience, vertical, compression, along, their, meridians, but, horizontally, experience, compression, only, in, the, portion, above, 51, 8, degrees, from, the, top, below, this, point, hemispherical, domes, experience, tension, horizontally, and, usually, require, buttressing, to, counteract, it, according, to, e, baldwin, smith, it, was, a, shape, likely, known, to, the, assyrians, defined, by, greek, theoretical, mathematicians, and, standardized, by, roman, builders, bulbous, domes, bulge, out, beyond, their, base, diameters, offering, a, profile, greater, than, a, hemisphere, an, onion, dome, is, a, greater, than, hemispherical, dome, with, a, pointed, top, in, an, ogee, profile, they, are, found, in, the, near, east, middle, east, persia, and, india, and, may, not, have, had, a, single, point, of, origin, their, appearance, in, northern, russian, architecture, predates, the, tatar, occupation, of, russia, and, so, is, not, easily, explained, as, the, result, of, that, influence, they, became, popular, in, the, second, half, of, the, 15th, century, in, the, low, countries, of, northern, europe, possibly, inspired, by, the, finials, of, minarets, in, egypt, and, syria, and, developed, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, in, the, netherlands, before, spreading, to, germany, becoming, a, popular, element, of, the, baroque, architecture, of, central, europe, german, bulbous, domes, were, also, influenced, by, russian, and, eastern, european, domes, the, examples, found, in, various, european, architectural, styles, are, typically, wooden, examples, include, kazan, church, in, kolomenskoye, and, the, brighton, pavilion, by, john, nash, in, islamic, architecture, they, are, typically, made, of, masonry, rather, than, timber, with, the, thick, and, heavy, bulging, portion, serving, to, buttress, against, the, tendency, of, masonry, domes, to, spread, at, their, bases, the, taj, mahal, is, a, famous, example, an, oval, dome, is, a, dome, of, oval, shape, in, plan, profile, or, both, the, term, comes, from, the, latin, ovum, meaning, egg, the, earliest, oval, domes, were, used, by, convenience, in, corbelled, stone, huts, as, rounded, but, geometrically, undefined, coverings, and, the, first, examples, in, asia, minor, date, to, around, 4000, b, c, the, geometry, was, eventually, defined, using, combinations, of, circular, arcs, transitioning, at, points, of, tangency, if, the, romans, created, oval, domes, it, was, only, in, exceptional, circumstances, the, roman, foundations, of, the, oval, plan, church, of, st, gereon, in, cologne, point, to, a, possible, example, domes, in, the, middle, ages, also, tended, to, be, circular, though, the, church, of, santo, tom, s, de, las, ollas, in, spain, has, an, oval, dome, over, its, oval, plan, other, examples, of, medieval, oval, domes, can, be, found, covering, rectangular, bays, in, churches, oval, plan, churches, became, a, type, in, the, renaissance, and, popular, in, the, baroque, style, the, dome, built, for, the, basilica, of, vicoforte, by, francesco, gallo, was, one, of, the, largest, and, most, complex, ever, made, although, the, ellipse, was, known, in, practice, domes, of, this, shape, were, created, by, combining, segments, of, circles, popular, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, oval, and, elliptical, plan, domes, can, vary, their, dimensions, in, three, axes, or, two, axes, a, sub, type, with, the, long, axis, having, a, semicircular, section, is, called, a, murcia, dome, as, in, the, chapel, of, the, junterones, at, murcia, cathedral, when, the, short, axis, has, a, semicircular, section, it, is, called, a, melon, dome, a, paraboloid, dome, is, a, surface, formed, by, the, rotation, around, a, vertical, axis, of, a, sector, of, a, parabola, like, other, rotational, domes, formed, by, the, rotation, of, a, curve, around, a, vertical, axis, paraboloid, domes, have, circular, bases, and, horizontal, sections, and, are, a, type, of, circular, dome, for, that, reason, because, of, their, shape, paraboloid, domes, experience, only, compression, both, radially, and, horizontally, also, called, sail, vaults, handkerchief, vaults, domical, vaults, a, term, sometimes, also, applied, to, cloister, vaults, pendentive, domes, a, term, that, has, also, been, applied, to, compound, domes, bohemian, vaults, or, byzantine, domes, this, type, can, be, thought, of, as, pendentives, that, rather, than, merely, touching, each, other, to, form, a, circular, base, for, a, drum, or, compound, dome, smoothly, continue, their, curvature, to, form, the, dome, itself, the, dome, gives, the, impression, of, a, square, sail, pinned, down, at, each, corner, and, billowing, upward, these, can, also, be, thought, of, as, saucer, domes, upon, pendentives, sail, domes, are, based, upon, the, shape, of, a, hemisphere, and, are, not, to, be, confused, with, elliptic, parabolic, vaults, which, appear, similar, but, have, different, characteristics, in, addition, to, semicircular, sail, vaults, there, are, variations, in, geometry, such, as, a, low, rise, to, span, ratio, or, covering, a, rectangular, plan, sail, vaults, of, all, types, have, a, variety, of, thrust, conditions, along, their, borders, which, can, cause, problems, but, have, been, widely, used, from, at, least, the, sixteenth, century, the, second, floor, of, the, llotja, de, la, seda, is, covered, by, a, series, of, nine, meter, wide, sail, vaults, also, called, segmental, domes, a, term, sometimes, also, used, for, cloister, vaults, or, calottes, these, have, profiles, of, less, than, half, a, circle, because, they, reduce, the, portion, of, the, dome, in, tension, these, domes, are, strong, but, have, increased, radial, thrust, many, of, the, largest, existing, domes, are, of, this, shape, masonry, saucer, domes, because, they, exist, entirely, in, compression, can, be, built, much, thinner, than, other, dome, shapes, without, becoming, unstable, the, trade, off, between, the, proportionately, increased, horizontal, thrust, at, their, abutments, and, their, decreased, weight, and, quantity, of, materials, may, make, them, more, economical, but, they, are, more, vulnerable, to, damage, from, movement, in, their, supports, also, called, gadrooned, fluted, organ, piped, pumpkin, melon, ribbed, parachute, scalloped, or, lobed, domes, these, are, a, type, of, dome, divided, at, the, base, into, curved, segments, which, follow, the, curve, of, the, elevation, fluted, may, refer, specifically, to, this, pattern, as, an, external, feature, such, as, was, common, in, mamluk, egypt, the, ribs, of, a, dome, are, the, radial, lines, of, masonry, that, extend, from, the, crown, down, to, the, springing, the, central, dome, of, the, hagia, sophia, uses, the, ribbed, method, which, accommodates, a, ring, of, windows, between, the, ribs, at, the, base, of, the, dome, the, central, dome, of, st, peter, s, basilica, also, uses, this, method, cultures, from, pre, history, to, modern, times, constructed, domed, dwellings, using, local, materials, although, it, is, not, known, when, the, first, dome, was, created, sporadic, examples, of, early, domed, structures, have, been, discovered, the, earliest, discovered, may, be, four, small, dwellings, made, of, mammoth, tusks, and, bones, the, first, was, found, by, a, farmer, in, mezhirich, ukraine, in, 1965, while, he, was, digging, in, his, cellar, and, archaeologists, unearthed, three, more, they, date, from, 19, 280, 11, 700, bc, in, modern, times, the, creation, of, relatively, simple, dome, like, structures, has, been, documented, among, various, indigenous, peoples, around, the, world, the, wigwam, was, made, by, native, americans, using, arched, branches, or, poles, covered, with, grass, or, hides, the, ef, people, of, central, africa, construct, similar, structures, using, leaves, as, shingles, another, example, is, the, igloo, a, shelter, built, from, blocks, of, compact, snow, and, used, by, the, inuit, among, others, the, himba, people, of, namibia, construct, desert, igloos, of, wattle, and, daub, for, use, as, temporary, shelters, at, seasonal, cattle, camps, and, as, permanent, homes, by, the, poor, extraordinarily, thin, domes, of, sun, baked, clay, 20, feet, in, diameter, 30, feet, high, and, nearly, parabolic, in, curve, are, known, from, cameroon, the, historical, development, from, structures, like, these, to, more, sophisticated, domes, is, not, well, documented, that, the, dome, was, known, to, early, mesopotamia, may, explain, the, existence, of, domes, in, both, china, and, the, west, in, the, first, millennium, bc, another, explanation, however, is, that, the, use, of, the, dome, shape, in, construction, did, not, have, a, single, point, of, origin, and, was, common, in, virtually, all, cultures, long, before, domes, were, constructed, with, enduring, materials, corbelled, stone, domes, have, been, found, from, the, neolithic, period, in, the, ancient, near, east, and, in, the, middle, east, to, western, europe, from, antiquity, the, kings, of, achaemenid, persia, held, audiences, and, festivals, in, domical, tents, derived, from, the, nomadic, traditions, of, central, asia, simple, domical, mausoleums, existed, in, the, hellenistic, period, the, remains, of, a, large, domed, circular, hall, in, the, parthian, capital, city, of, nyssa, has, been, dated, to, perhaps, the, first, century, ad, showing, the, existence, of, a, monumental, domical, tradition, in, central, asia, that, had, hitherto, been, unknown, and, which, seems, to, have, preceded, roman, imperial, monuments, or, at, least, to, have, grown, independently, from, them, it, likely, had, a, wooden, dome, persian, architecture, likely, inherited, an, architectural, tradition, of, dome, building, dating, back, to, the, earliest, mesopotamian, domes, due, to, the, scarcity, of, wood, in, many, areas, of, the, iranian, plateau, and, greater, iran, domes, were, an, important, part, of, vernacular, architecture, throughout, persian, history, the, persian, invention, of, the, squinch, a, series, of, concentric, arches, forming, a, half, cone, over, the, corner, of, a, room, enabled, the, transition, from, the, walls, of, a, square, chamber, to, an, octagonal, base, for, a, dome, in, a, way, reliable, enough, for, large, constructions, and, domes, moved, to, the, forefront, of, persian, architecture, as, a, result, pre, islamic, domes, in, persia, are, commonly, semi, elliptical, with, pointed, domes, and, those, with, conical, outer, shells, being, the, majority, of, the, domes, in, the, islamic, periods, the, area, of, north, eastern, iran, was, along, with, egypt, one, of, two, areas, notable, for, early, developments, in, islamic, domed, mausoleums, which, appear, in, the, tenth, century, the, samanid, mausoleum, in, transoxiana, dates, to, no, later, than, 943, and, is, the, first, to, have, squinches, create, a, regular, octagon, as, a, base, for, the, dome, which, then, became, the, standard, practice, cylindrical, or, polygonal, plan, tower, tombs, with, conical, roofs, over, domes, also, exist, beginning, in, the, 11th, century, the, seljuk, empire, s, notables, built, tomb, towers, called, turkish, triangles, as, well, as, cube, mausoleums, covered, with, a, variety, of, dome, forms, seljuk, domes, included, conical, semi, circular, and, pointed, shapes, in, one, or, two, shells, shallow, semi, circular, domes, are, mainly, found, from, the, seljuk, era, the, double, shell, domes, were, either, discontinuous, or, continuous, the, domed, enclosure, of, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, built, in, 1086, 7, by, nizam, al, mulk, was, the, largest, masonry, dome, in, the, islamic, world, at, that, time, had, eight, ribs, and, introduced, a, new, form, of, corner, squinch, with, two, quarter, domes, supporting, a, short, barrel, vault, in, 1088, t, j, al, molk, a, rival, of, nizam, al, mulk, built, another, dome, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, same, mosque, with, interlacing, ribs, forming, five, pointed, stars, and, pentagons, this, is, considered, the, landmark, seljuk, dome, and, may, have, inspired, subsequent, patterning, and, the, domes, of, the, il, khanate, period, the, use, of, tile, and, of, plain, or, painted, plaster, to, decorate, dome, interiors, rather, than, brick, increased, under, the, seljuks, beginning, in, the, ilkhanate, persian, domes, achieved, their, final, configuration, of, structural, supports, zone, of, transition, drum, and, shells, and, subsequent, evolution, was, restricted, to, variations, in, form, and, shell, geometry, characteristic, of, these, domes, are, the, use, of, high, drums, and, several, types, of, discontinuous, double, shells, and, the, development, of, triple, shells, and, internal, stiffeners, occurred, at, this, time, the, construction, of, tomb, towers, decreased, the, 7, 5, meter, wide, double, dome, of, soltan, bakht, agha, mausoleum, 1351, 1352, is, the, earliest, known, example, in, which, the, two, shells, of, the, dome, have, significantly, different, profiles, which, spread, rapidly, throughout, the, region, the, development, of, taller, drums, also, continued, into, the, timurid, period, the, large, bulbous, fluted, domes, on, tall, drums, that, are, characteristic, of, 15th, century, timurid, architecture, were, the, culmination, of, the, central, asian, and, iranian, tradition, of, tall, domes, with, glazed, tile, coverings, in, blue, and, other, colors, the, domes, of, the, safavid, dynasty, 1501, 1732, are, characterized, by, a, distinctive, bulbous, profile, and, are, considered, the, last, generation, of, persian, domes, they, are, generally, thinner, than, earlier, domes, and, are, decorated, with, a, variety, of, colored, glazed, tiles, and, complex, vegetal, patterns, and, they, were, influential, on, those, of, other, islamic, styles, such, as, the, mughal, architecture, of, india, an, exaggerated, style, of, onion, dome, on, a, short, drum, as, can, be, seen, at, the, shah, cheragh, 1852, 1853, first, appeared, in, the, qajar, period, domes, have, remained, important, in, modern, mausoleums, and, domed, cisterns, and, icehouses, remain, common, sights, in, the, countryside, very, little, has, survived, of, ancient, chinese, architecture, due, to, the, extensive, use, of, timber, as, a, building, material, brick, and, stone, vaults, used, in, tomb, construction, have, survived, and, the, corbeled, dome, was, used, rarely, in, tombs, and, temples, the, earliest, true, domes, found, in, chinese, tombs, were, shallow, cloister, vaults, called, simian, jieding, derived, from, the, han, use, of, barrel, vaulting, unlike, the, cloister, vaults, of, western, europe, the, corners, are, rounded, off, as, they, rise, the, first, known, example, is, a, brick, tomb, dating, from, the, end, of, the, western, han, period, near, the, modern, city, of, xiangcheng, in, henan, province, these, four, sided, domes, used, small, interlocking, bricks, and, enabled, a, square, space, near, the, entrance, of, a, tomb, large, enough, for, several, people, that, may, have, been, used, for, funeral, ceremonies, the, interlocking, brick, technique, was, rapidly, adopted, and, four, sided, domes, became, widespread, outside, henan, by, the, end, of, the, first, century, ad, a, model, of, a, tomb, found, with, a, shallow, true, dome, from, the, late, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, can, be, seen, at, the, guangzhou, museum, canton, another, the, lei, cheng, uk, han, tomb, found, in, hong, kong, in, 1955, has, a, design, common, among, eastern, han, dynasty, 25, ad, 220, ad, tombs, in, south, china, a, barrel, vaulted, entrance, leading, to, a, domed, front, hall, with, barrel, vaulted, chambers, branching, from, it, in, a, cross, shape, it, is, the, only, such, tomb, that, has, been, found, in, hong, kong, and, is, exhibited, as, part, of, the, hong, kong, museum, of, history, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, 220, 280, the, cross, joint, dome, siyuxuanjinshi, was, developed, under, the, wu, and, western, jin, dynasties, south, of, the, yangtze, river, with, arcs, building, out, from, the, corners, of, a, square, room, until, they, met, and, joined, at, the, center, these, domes, were, stronger, had, a, steeped, angle, and, could, cover, larger, areas, than, the, relatively, shallow, cloister, vaults, over, time, they, were, made, taller, and, wider, there, were, also, corbel, vaults, called, diese, although, these, are, the, weakest, type, some, tombs, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, have, beehive, domes, roman, domes, are, found, in, baths, villas, palaces, and, tombs, oculi, are, common, features, they, are, customarily, hemispherical, in, shape, and, partially, or, totally, concealed, on, the, exterior, to, buttress, the, horizontal, thrusts, of, a, large, hemispherical, masonry, dome, the, supporting, walls, were, built, up, beyond, the, base, to, at, least, the, haunches, of, the, dome, and, the, dome, was, then, also, sometimes, covered, with, a, conical, or, polygonal, roof, domes, reached, monumental, size, in, the, roman, imperial, period, roman, baths, played, a, leading, role, in, the, development, of, domed, construction, in, general, and, monumental, domes, in, particular, modest, domes, in, baths, dating, from, the, 2nd, and, 1st, centuries, bc, are, seen, in, pompeii, in, the, cold, rooms, of, the, terme, stabiane, and, the, terme, del, foro, however, the, extensive, use, of, domes, did, not, occur, before, the, 1st, century, ad, the, growth, of, domed, construction, increases, under, emperor, nero, and, the, flavians, in, the, 1st, century, ad, and, during, the, 2nd, century, centrally, planned, halls, become, increasingly, important, parts, of, palace, and, palace, villa, layouts, beginning, in, the, 1st, century, serving, as, state, banqueting, halls, audience, rooms, or, throne, rooms, the, pantheon, a, temple, in, rome, completed, by, emperor, hadrian, as, part, of, the, baths, of, agrippa, is, the, most, famous, best, preserved, and, largest, roman, dome, segmented, domes, made, of, radially, concave, wedges, or, of, alternating, concave, and, flat, wedges, appear, under, hadrian, in, the, 2nd, century, and, most, preserved, examples, of, this, style, date, from, this, period, in, the, 3rd, century, imperial, mausoleums, began, to, be, built, as, domed, rotundas, rather, than, as, tumulus, structures, or, other, types, following, similar, monuments, by, private, citizens, the, technique, of, building, lightweight, domes, with, interlocking, hollow, ceramic, tubes, further, developed, in, north, africa, and, italy, in, the, late, third, and, early, fourth, centuries, in, the, 4th, century, roman, domes, proliferated, due, to, changes, in, the, way, domes, were, constructed, including, advances, in, centering, techniques, and, the, use, of, brick, ribbing, the, material, of, choice, in, construction, gradually, transitioned, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, from, stone, or, concrete, to, lighter, brick, in, thin, shells, baptisteries, began, to, be, built, in, the, manner, of, domed, mausoleums, during, the, 4th, century, in, italy, the, octagonal, lateran, baptistery, or, the, baptistery, of, the, holy, sepulchre, may, have, been, the, first, and, the, style, spread, during, the, 5th, century, by, the, 5th, century, structures, with, small, scale, domed, cross, plans, existed, across, the, christian, world, with, the, end, of, the, western, roman, empire, domes, became, a, signature, feature, of, the, church, architecture, of, the, surviving, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, 6th, century, church, building, by, the, emperor, justinian, used, the, domed, cross, unit, on, a, monumental, scale, and, his, architects, made, the, domed, brick, vaulted, central, plan, standard, throughout, the, roman, east, this, divergence, with, the, roman, west, from, the, second, third, of, the, 6th, century, may, be, considered, the, beginning, of, a, byzantine, architecture, justinian, s, hagia, sophia, was, an, original, and, innovative, design, with, no, known, precedents, in, the, way, it, covers, a, basilica, plan, with, dome, and, semi, domes, periodic, earthquakes, in, the, region, have, caused, three, partial, collapses, of, the, dome, and, necessitated, repairs, cross, domed, units, a, more, secure, structural, system, created, by, bracing, a, dome, on, all, four, sides, with, broad, arches, became, a, standard, element, on, a, smaller, scale, in, later, byzantine, church, architecture, the, cross, in, square, plan, with, a, single, dome, at, the, crossing, or, five, domes, in, a, quincunx, pattern, became, widely, popular, in, the, middle, byzantine, period, c, 843, 1204, it, is, the, most, common, church, plan, from, the, tenth, century, until, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, resting, domes, on, circular, or, polygonal, drums, pierced, with, windows, eventually, became, the, standard, style, with, regional, characteristics, in, the, byzantine, period, domes, were, normally, hemispherical, and, had, with, occasional, exceptions, windowed, drums, all, of, the, surviving, examples, in, constantinople, are, ribbed, or, pumpkin, domes, with, the, divisions, corresponding, to, the, number, of, windows, roofing, for, domes, ranged, from, simple, ceramic, tile, to, more, expensive, more, durable, and, more, form, fitting, lead, sheeting, metal, clamps, between, stone, cornice, blocks, metal, tie, rods, and, metal, chains, were, also, used, to, stabilize, domed, construction, the, technique, of, using, double, shells, for, domes, although, revived, in, the, renaissance, originated, in, byzantine, practice, the, syria, and, palestine, area, has, a, long, tradition, of, domical, architecture, including, wooden, domes, in, shapes, described, as, conoid, or, similar, to, pine, cones, when, the, arab, muslim, forces, conquered, the, region, they, employed, local, craftsmen, for, their, buildings, and, by, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, the, dome, had, begun, to, become, an, architectural, symbol, of, islam, in, addition, to, religious, shrines, such, as, the, dome, of, the, rock, domes, were, used, over, the, audience, and, throne, halls, of, umayyad, palaces, and, as, part, of, porches, pavilions, fountains, towers, and, the, calderia, of, baths, blending, the, architectural, features, of, both, byzantine, and, persian, architecture, the, domes, used, both, pendentives, and, squinches, and, were, made, in, a, variety, of, shapes, and, materials, although, architecture, in, the, region, would, decline, following, the, movement, of, the, capital, to, iraq, under, the, abbasids, in, 750, mosques, built, after, a, revival, in, the, late, 11th, century, usually, followed, the, umayyad, model, early, versions, of, bulbous, domes, can, be, seen, in, mosaic, illustrations, in, syria, dating, to, the, umayyad, period, they, were, used, to, cover, large, buildings, in, syria, after, the, eleventh, century, italian, church, architecture, from, the, late, sixth, century, to, the, end, of, the, eighth, century, was, influenced, less, by, the, trends, of, constantinople, than, by, a, variety, of, byzantine, provincial, plans, with, the, crowning, of, charlemagne, as, a, new, roman, emperor, byzantine, influences, were, largely, replaced, in, a, revival, of, earlier, western, building, traditions, occasional, exceptions, include, examples, of, early, quincunx, churches, at, milan, and, near, cassino, another, is, the, palatine, chapel, its, domed, octagon, design, was, influenced, by, byzantine, models, it, was, the, largest, dome, north, of, the, alps, at, that, time, venice, southern, italy, and, sicily, served, as, outposts, of, middle, byzantine, architectural, influence, in, italy, the, great, mosque, of, c, rdoba, contains, the, first, known, examples, of, the, crossed, arch, dome, type, the, use, of, corner, squinches, to, support, domes, was, widespread, in, islamic, architecture, by, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, after, the, ninth, century, mosques, in, north, africa, often, have, a, small, decorative, dome, over, the, mihrab, additional, domes, are, sometimes, used, at, the, corners, of, the, mihrab, wall, at, the, entrance, bay, or, on, the, square, tower, minarets, egypt, along, with, north, eastern, iran, was, one, of, two, areas, notable, for, early, developments, in, islamic, mausoleums, beginning, in, the, 10th, century, fatimid, mausoleums, were, mostly, simple, square, buildings, covered, by, a, dome, domes, were, smooth, or, ribbed, and, had, a, characteristic, fatimid, keel, shape, profile, domes, in, romanesque, architecture, are, generally, found, within, crossing, towers, at, the, intersection, of, a, church, s, nave, and, transept, which, conceal, the, domes, externally, they, are, typically, octagonal, in, plan, and, use, corner, squinches, to, translate, a, square, bay, into, a, suitable, octagonal, base, they, appear, in, connection, with, basilicas, almost, throughout, europe, between, 1050, and, 1100, the, crusades, beginning, in, 1095, also, appear, to, have, influenced, domed, architecture, in, western, europe, particularly, in, the, areas, around, the, mediterranean, sea, the, knights, templar, headquartered, at, the, site, built, a, series, of, centrally, planned, churches, throughout, europe, modeled, on, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, with, the, dome, of, the, rock, also, an, influence, in, southwest, france, there, are, over, 250, domed, romanesque, churches, in, the, p, rigord, region, alone, the, use, of, pendentives, to, support, domes, in, the, aquitaine, region, rather, than, the, squinches, more, typical, of, western, medieval, architecture, strongly, implies, a, byzantine, influence, gothic, domes, are, uncommon, due, to, the, use, of, rib, vaults, over, naves, and, with, church, crossings, usually, focused, instead, by, a, tall, steeple, but, there, are, examples, of, small, octagonal, crossing, domes, in, cathedrals, as, the, style, developed, from, the, romanesque, star, shaped, domes, found, at, the, moorish, palace, of, the, alhambra, in, granada, spain, the, hall, of, the, abencerrajes, c, 1333, 91, and, the, hall, of, the, two, sisters, c, 1333, 54, are, extraordinarily, developed, examples, of, muqarnas, domes, in, the, first, half, of, the, fourteenth, century, stone, blocks, replaced, bricks, as, the, primary, building, material, in, the, dome, construction, of, mamluk, egypt, and, over, the, course, of, 250, years, around, 400, domes, were, built, in, cairo, to, cover, the, tombs, of, mamluk, sultans, and, emirs, dome, profiles, were, varied, with, keel, shaped, bulbous, ogee, stilted, domes, and, others, being, used, on, the, drum, angles, were, chamfered, or, sometimes, stepped, externally, and, triple, windows, were, used, in, a, tri, lobed, arrangement, on, the, faces, bulbous, cupolas, on, minarets, were, used, in, egypt, beginning, around, 1330, spreading, to, syria, in, the, following, century, in, the, fifteenth, century, pilgrimages, to, and, flourishing, trade, relations, with, the, near, east, exposed, the, low, countries, of, northwest, europe, to, the, use, of, bulbous, domes, in, the, architecture, of, the, orient, and, such, domes, apparently, became, associated, with, the, city, of, jerusalem, multi, story, spires, with, truncated, bulbous, cupolas, supporting, smaller, cupolas, or, crowns, became, popular, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, multidomed, church, is, a, typical, form, of, russian, church, architecture, that, distinguishes, russia, from, other, orthodox, nations, and, christian, denominations, indeed, the, earliest, russian, churches, built, just, after, the, christianization, of, kievan, rus, were, multi, domed, which, has, led, some, historians, to, speculate, about, how, russian, pre, christian, pagan, temples, might, have, looked, examples, of, these, early, churches, are, the, 13, domed, wooden, saint, sophia, cathedral, in, novgorod, 989, and, the, 25, domed, stone, desyatinnaya, church, in, kiev, 989, 996, the, number, of, domes, typically, has, a, symbolical, meaning, in, russian, architecture, for, example, 13, domes, symbolize, christ, with, 12, apostles, while, 25, domes, means, the, same, with, an, additional, 12, prophets, of, the, old, testament, the, multiple, domes, of, russian, churches, were, often, comparatively, smaller, than, byzantine, domes, plentiful, timber, in, russia, made, wooden, domes, common, and, at, least, partially, contributed, to, the, popularity, of, onion, domes, which, were, easier, to, shape, in, wood, than, in, masonry, the, earliest, stone, churches, in, russia, featured, byzantine, style, domes, however, by, the, early, modern, era, the, onion, dome, had, become, the, predominant, form, in, traditional, russian, architecture, the, onion, dome, is, a, dome, whose, shape, resembles, an, onion, after, which, they, are, named, such, domes, are, often, larger, in, diameter, than, the, drums, they, sit, on, and, their, height, usually, exceeds, their, width, the, whole, bulbous, structure, tapers, smoothly, to, a, point, though, the, earliest, preserved, russian, domes, of, such, type, date, from, the, 16th, century, illustrations, from, older, chronicles, indicate, they, have, existed, since, the, late, 13th, century, like, tented, roofs, which, were, combined, with, and, sometimes, replaced, domes, in, russian, architecture, since, the, 16th, century, onion, domes, initially, were, used, only, in, wooden, churches, builders, introduced, them, into, stone, architecture, much, later, and, continued, to, make, their, carcasses, of, either, of, wood, or, metal, on, top, of, masonry, drums, russian, domes, are, often, gilded, or, brightly, painted, a, dangerous, technique, of, chemical, gilding, using, mercury, had, been, applied, on, some, occasions, until, the, mid, 19th, century, most, notably, in, the, giant, dome, of, saint, isaac, s, cathedral, the, more, modern, and, safe, method, of, gold, electroplating, was, applied, for, the, first, time, in, gilding, the, domes, of, the, cathedral, of, christ, the, saviour, in, moscow, the, tallest, eastern, orthodox, church, in, the, world, the, domes, of, the, saint, sophia, cathedral, and, dormition, cathedral, were, remodeled, to, the, helmet, shaped, baroque, style, by, ivan, mazepa, in, the, early, 18th, century, who, also, paid, for, gilding, of, the, domes, mazepa, s, reign, also, included, the, construction, of, an, octagonal, western, bay, with, a, baroque, dome, 1672, and, five, helmet, shaped, domes, over, boris, and, gleb, cathedral, in, chernihiv, which, were, removed, in, the, 20th, century, by, the, soviet, government, the, rise, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, its, spread, in, asia, minor, and, the, balkans, coincided, with, the, decline, of, the, seljuk, turks, and, the, byzantine, empire, early, ottoman, buildings, for, almost, two, centuries, after, 1300, were, characterized, by, a, blending, of, ottoman, culture, and, indigenous, architecture, and, the, pendentive, dome, was, used, throughout, the, empire, the, byzantine, dome, form, was, adopted, and, further, developed, ottoman, architecture, made, exclusive, use, of, the, semi, spherical, dome, for, vaulting, over, even, very, small, spaces, influenced, by, the, earlier, traditions, of, both, byzantine, anatolia, and, central, asia, the, smaller, the, structure, the, simpler, the, plan, but, mosques, of, medium, size, were, also, covered, by, single, domes, early, experiments, with, large, domes, include, the, domed, square, mosques, of, ine, and, mudurnu, under, bayezid, i, and, the, later, domed, zawiya, mosques, at, bursa, the, erefeli, mosque, at, edirne, developed, the, idea, of, the, central, dome, being, a, larger, version, of, the, domed, modules, used, throughout, the, rest, of, the, structure, to, generate, open, space, this, idea, became, important, to, the, ottoman, style, as, it, developed, the, bayezid, ii, mosque, 1501, 1506, in, istanbul, begins, the, classical, period, in, ottoman, architecture, in, which, the, great, imperial, mosques, with, variations, resemble, the, former, byzantine, basilica, of, hagia, sophia, in, having, a, large, central, dome, with, semi, domes, of, the, same, span, to, the, east, and, west, hagia, sophia, s, central, dome, arrangement, is, largely, reproduced, in, three, ottoman, mosques, in, istanbul, the, bayezid, ii, mosque, the, k, l, ali, pasha, mosque, and, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, other, imperial, mosques, in, istanbul, added, semi, domes, to, the, north, and, south, doing, away, with, the, basilica, plan, starting, with, the, ehzade, mosque, and, seen, again, in, later, examples, such, as, the, sultan, ahmed, i, mosque, and, the, yeni, cami, the, classical, period, lasted, into, the, 17th, century, but, its, peak, is, associated, with, the, architect, mimar, sinan, in, the, 16th, century, in, addition, to, large, imperial, mosques, he, designed, hundreds, of, other, monuments, including, medium, sized, mosques, such, as, the, mihrimah, sultan, mosque, sokollu, mehmed, pasha, mosque, and, r, stem, pasha, mosque, and, the, tomb, of, suleiman, the, magnificent, with, its, double, shell, dome, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, built, from, 1550, to, 1557, has, a, main, dome, 53, meters, high, with, a, diameter, of, 26, 5, meters, at, the, time, it, was, built, the, dome, was, the, highest, in, the, ottoman, empire, when, measured, from, sea, level, but, lower, from, the, floor, of, the, building, and, smaller, in, diameter, than, that, of, the, nearby, hagia, sophia, another, classical, domed, mosque, type, is, like, the, byzantine, church, of, sergius, and, bacchus, the, domed, polygon, within, a, square, octagons, and, hexagons, were, common, such, as, those, of, the, erefeli, mosque, 1437, 1447, and, the, selimiye, mosque, in, edirne, the, selimiye, mosque, was, the, first, structure, built, by, the, ottomans, that, had, a, larger, dome, than, that, of, the, hagia, sophia, the, dome, rises, above, a, square, bay, corner, semi, domes, convert, this, into, an, octagon, which, muqarnas, transition, to, a, circular, base, the, dome, has, an, average, internal, diameter, of, about, 31, 5, meters, while, that, of, hagia, sophia, averages, 31, 3, meters, designed, and, built, by, architect, mimar, sinan, between, 1568, and, 1574, when, he, finished, it, he, was, 86, years, old, and, he, considered, the, mosque, his, masterpiece, filippo, brunelleschi, s, octagonal, brick, domical, vault, over, florence, cathedral, was, built, between, 1420, and, 1436, and, the, lantern, surmounting, the, dome, was, completed, in, 1467, the, dome, is, 42, meters, wide, and, made, of, two, shells, the, dome, is, not, itself, renaissance, in, style, although, the, lantern, is, closer, a, combination, of, dome, drum, pendentives, and, barrel, vaults, developed, as, the, characteristic, structural, forms, of, large, renaissance, churches, following, a, period, of, innovation, in, the, later, fifteenth, century, florence, was, the, first, italian, city, to, develop, the, new, style, followed, by, rome, and, then, venice, brunelleschi, s, domes, at, san, lorenzo, and, the, pazzi, chapel, established, them, as, a, key, element, of, renaissance, architecture, his, plan, for, the, dome, of, the, pazzi, chapel, in, florence, s, basilica, of, santa, croce, 1430, 52, illustrates, the, renaissance, enthusiasm, for, geometry, and, for, the, circle, as, geometry, s, supreme, form, this, emphasis, on, geometric, essentials, would, be, very, influential, de, re, aedificatoria, written, by, leon, battista, alberti, around, 1452, recommends, vaults, with, coffering, for, churches, as, in, the, pantheon, and, the, first, design, for, a, dome, at, st, peter, s, basilica, in, rome, is, usually, attributed, to, him, although, the, recorded, architect, is, bernardo, rossellino, this, would, culminate, in, bramante, s, 1505, 06, projects, for, a, wholly, new, st, peter, s, basilica, marking, the, beginning, of, the, displacement, of, the, gothic, ribbed, vault, with, the, combination, of, dome, and, barrel, vault, which, proceeded, throughout, the, sixteenth, century, bramante, s, initial, design, was, for, a, greek, cross, plan, with, a, large, central, hemispherical, dome, and, four, smaller, domes, around, it, in, a, quincunx, pattern, work, began, in, 1506, and, continued, under, a, succession, of, builders, over, the, next, 120, years, the, dome, was, completed, by, giacomo, della, porta, and, domenico, fontana, the, publication, of, sebastiano, serlio, s, treatise, one, of, the, most, popular, architectural, treatises, ever, published, was, responsible, for, the, spread, of, the, oval, in, late, renaissance, and, baroque, architecture, throughout, italy, spain, france, and, central, europe, the, villa, capra, also, known, as, la, rotunda, was, built, by, andrea, palladio, from, 1565, to, 1569, near, vicenza, its, highly, symmetrical, square, plan, centers, on, a, circular, room, covered, by, a, dome, and, it, proved, highly, influential, on, the, georgian, architects, of, 18th, century, england, architects, in, russia, and, architects, in, america, thomas, jefferson, among, them, palladio, s, two, domed, churches, in, venice, are, san, giorgio, maggiore, 1565, 1610, and, il, redentore, 1577, 92, the, latter, built, in, thanksgiving, for, the, end, of, a, bad, outbreak, of, plague, in, the, city, the, spread, of, the, renaissance, style, dome, outside, of, italy, began, with, central, europe, although, there, was, often, a, stylistic, delay, of, a, century, or, two, domes, first, appeared, in, south, asia, during, the, medieval, era, they, were, generally, constructed, with, stone, brick, and, mortar, and, iron, dowels, and, cramps, centering, was, made, from, timber, and, bamboo, the, use, of, iron, cramps, to, join, adjacent, stones, was, known, in, classical, india, and, was, used, at, the, base, of, domes, for, hoop, reinforcement, the, synthesis, of, styles, created, by, this, introduction, of, new, forms, to, the, hindu, tradition, of, trabeate, construction, created, a, distinctive, architecture, domes, in, pre, mughal, india, have, a, standard, squat, circular, shape, with, a, lotus, design, and, bulbous, finial, at, the, top, derived, from, hindu, architecture, because, the, hindu, architectural, tradition, did, not, include, arches, flat, corbels, were, used, to, transition, from, the, corners, of, the, room, to, the, dome, rather, than, squinches, in, contrast, to, persian, and, ottoman, domes, the, domes, of, indian, tombs, tend, to, be, more, bulbous, the, earliest, examples, include, the, half, domes, of, the, late, 13th, century, tomb, of, balban, and, the, small, dome, of, the, tomb, of, khan, shahid, which, were, made, of, roughly, cut, material, and, would, have, needed, covering, surface, finishes, under, the, lodi, dynasty, there, was, a, large, proliferation, of, tomb, building, with, octagonal, plans, reserved, for, royalty, and, square, plans, used, for, others, of, high, rank, and, the, first, double, dome, was, introduced, to, india, in, this, period, the, first, major, mughal, building, is, the, domed, tomb, of, humayun, built, between, 1562, and, 1571, by, a, persian, architect, the, central, double, dome, covers, an, octagonal, central, chamber, about, 15, meters, wide, and, is, accompanied, by, small, domed, chattri, made, of, brick, and, faced, with, stone, chatris, the, domed, kiosks, on, pillars, characteristic, of, mughal, roofs, were, adopted, from, their, hindu, use, as, cenotaphs, the, fusion, of, persian, and, indian, architecture, can, be, seen, in, the, dome, shape, of, the, taj, mahal, the, bulbous, shape, derives, from, persian, timurid, domes, and, the, finial, with, lotus, leaf, base, is, derived, from, hindu, temples, the, gol, gumbaz, or, round, dome, is, one, of, the, largest, masonry, domes, in, the, world, it, has, an, internal, diameter, of, 41, 15, meters, and, a, height, of, 54, 25, meters, the, dome, was, the, most, technically, advanced, built, in, the, deccan, the, last, major, islamic, tomb, built, in, india, was, the, tomb, of, safdar, jang, 1753, 54, the, central, dome, is, reportedly, triple, shelled, with, two, relatively, flat, inner, brick, domes, and, an, outer, bulbous, marble, dome, although, it, may, actually, be, that, the, marble, and, second, brick, domes, are, joined, everywhere, but, under, the, lotus, leaf, finial, at, the, top, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, the, lantern, of, the, italian, dome, spread, to, germany, gradually, adopting, the, bulbous, cupola, from, the, netherlands, russian, architecture, strongly, influenced, the, many, bulbous, domes, of, the, wooden, churches, of, bohemia, and, silesia, and, in, bavaria, bulbous, domes, less, resemble, dutch, models, than, russian, ones, domes, like, these, gained, in, popularity, in, central, and, southern, germany, and, in, austria, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, particularly, in, the, baroque, style, and, influenced, many, bulbous, cupolas, in, poland, and, eastern, europe, in, the, baroque, period, however, many, bulbous, domes, in, eastern, europe, were, replaced, over, time, in, the, larger, cities, during, the, second, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, in, favor, of, hemispherical, or, stilted, cupolas, in, the, french, or, italian, styles, the, construction, of, domes, in, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, relied, primarily, on, empirical, techniques, and, oral, traditions, rather, than, the, architectural, treatises, of, the, times, which, avoided, practical, details, this, was, adequate, for, domes, up, to, medium, size, with, diameters, in, the, range, of, 12, to, 20, meters, materials, were, considered, homogeneous, and, rigid, with, compression, taken, into, account, and, elasticity, ignored, the, weight, of, materials, and, the, size, of, the, dome, were, the, key, references, lateral, tensions, in, a, dome, were, counteracted, with, horizontal, rings, of, iron, stone, or, wood, incorporated, into, the, structure, over, the, course, of, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, developments, in, mathematics, and, the, study, of, statics, led, to, a, more, precise, formalization, of, the, ideas, of, the, traditional, constructive, practices, of, arches, and, vaults, and, there, was, a, diffusion, of, studies, on, the, most, stable, form, for, these, structures, the, catenary, curve, robert, hooke, who, first, articulated, that, a, catenary, arch, was, comparable, to, an, inverted, hanging, chain, may, have, advised, wren, on, how, to, achieve, the, crossing, dome, of, st, paul, s, cathedral, wren, s, structural, system, became, the, standard, for, large, domes, well, into, the, 19th, century, the, ribs, in, guarino, guarini, s, san, lorenzo, and, il, sidone, were, shaped, as, catenary, arches, the, idea, of, a, large, oculus, in, a, solid, dome, revealing, a, second, dome, originated, with, him, he, also, established, the, oval, dome, as, a, reconciliation, of, the, longitudinal, plan, church, favored, by, the, liturgy, of, the, counter, reformation, and, the, centralized, plan, favored, by, idealists, because, of, the, imprecision, of, oval, domes, in, the, rococo, period, drums, were, problematic, and, the, domes, instead, often, rested, directly, on, arches, or, pendentives, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, study, of, dome, structures, changed, radically, with, domes, being, considered, as, a, composition, of, smaller, elements, each, subject, to, mathematical, and, mechanical, laws, and, easier, to, analyse, individually, rather, than, being, considered, as, whole, units, unto, themselves, although, never, very, popular, in, domestic, settings, domes, were, used, in, a, number, of, 18th, century, homes, built, in, the, neo, classical, style, in, the, united, states, most, public, buildings, in, the, late, 18th, century, were, only, distinguishable, from, private, residences, because, they, featured, cupolas, the, historicism, of, the, 19th, century, led, to, many, domes, being, re, translations, of, the, great, domes, of, the, past, rather, than, further, stylistic, developments, especially, in, sacred, architecture, new, production, techniques, allowed, for, cast, iron, and, wrought, iron, to, be, produced, both, in, larger, quantities, and, at, relatively, low, prices, during, the, industrial, revolution, russia, which, had, large, supplies, of, iron, has, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, iron, s, architectural, use, excluding, those, that, simply, imitated, multi, shell, masonry, metal, framed, domes, such, as, the, elliptical, dome, of, royal, albert, hall, in, london, 57, to, 67, meters, in, diameter, and, the, circular, dome, of, the, halle, au, bl, in, paris, may, represent, the, century, s, chief, development, of, the, simple, domed, form, cast, iron, domes, were, particularly, popular, in, france, the, practice, of, building, rotating, domes, for, housing, large, telescopes, was, begun, in, the, 19th, century, with, early, examples, using, papier, m, ch, to, minimize, weight, unique, glass, domes, springing, straight, from, ground, level, were, used, for, hothouses, and, winter, gardens, elaborate, covered, shopping, arcades, included, large, glazed, domes, at, their, cross, intersections, the, large, domes, of, the, 19th, century, included, exhibition, buildings, and, functional, structures, such, as, gasometers, and, locomotive, sheds, the, first, fully, triangulated, framed, dome, was, built, in, berlin, in, 1863, by, johann, wilhelm, schwedler, and, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, similarly, triangulated, frame, domes, had, become, fairly, common, vladimir, shukhov, was, also, an, early, pioneer, of, what, would, later, be, called, gridshell, structures, and, in, 1897, he, employed, them, in, domed, exhibit, pavilions, at, the, all, russia, industrial, and, art, exhibition, domes, built, with, steel, and, concrete, were, able, to, achieve, very, large, spans, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, guastavino, family, a, father, and, son, team, who, worked, on, the, eastern, seaboard, of, the, united, states, further, developed, the, masonry, dome, using, tiles, set, flat, against, the, surface, of, the, curve, and, fast, setting, portland, cement, which, allowed, mild, steel, bar, to, be, used, to, counteract, tension, forces, the, thin, domical, shell, was, further, developed, with, the, construction, by, walther, bauersfeld, of, two, planetarium, domes, in, jena, germany, in, the, early, 1920s, they, consisting, of, a, triangulated, frame, of, light, steel, bars, and, mesh, covered, by, a, thin, layer, of, concrete, these, are, generally, taken, to, be, the, first, modern, architectural, thin, shells, these, are, also, considered, the, first, geodesic, domes, geodesic, domes, have, been, used, for, radar, enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and, weather, stations, architectural, shells, had, their, heyday, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, peaking, in, popularity, shortly, before, the, widespread, adoption, of, computers, and, the, finite, element, method, of, structural, analysis, the, first, permanent, air, supported, membrane, domes, were, the, radar, domes, designed, and, built, by, walter, bird, after, world, war, ii, their, low, cost, eventually, led, to, the, development, of, permanent, versions, using, teflon, coated, fiberglass, and, by, 1985, the, majority, of, the, domed, stadiums, around, the, world, used, this, system, tensegrity, domes, patented, by, buckminster, fuller, in, 1962, are, membrane, structures, consisting, of, radial, trusses, made, from, steel, cables, under, tension, with, vertical, steel, pipes, spreading, the, cables, into, the, truss, form, they, have, been, made, circular, elliptical, and, other, shapes, to, cover, stadiums, from, korea, to, florida, tension, membrane, design, has, depended, upon, computers, and, the, increasing, availability, of, powerful, computers, resulted, in, many, developments, being, made, in, the, last, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, higher, expense, of, rigid, large, span, domes, made, them, relatively, rare, although, rigidly, moving, panels, is, the, most, popular, system, for, sports, stadiums, with, retractable, roofing
