a, mobile, phone, or, cell, phone, is, a, portable, telephone, that, can, make, and, receive, calls, over, a, radio, frequency, link, while, the, user, is, moving, within, a, telephone, service, area, as, opposed, to, a, fixed, location, phone, landline, phone, the, radio, frequency, link, establishes, a, connection, to, the, switching, systems, of, a, mobile, phone, operator, which, provides, access, to, the, public, switched, telephone, network, pstn, modern, mobile, telephone, services, use, a, cellular, network, architecture, and, therefore, mobile, telephones, are, called, cellphones, or, cell, phones, in, north, america, in, addition, to, telephony, digital, mobile, phones, support, a, variety, of, other, services, such, as, text, messaging, multimedia, messaging, email, internet, access, via, lte, 5g, nr, or, wi, fi, short, range, wireless, communications, infrared, bluetooth, satellite, access, navigation, messaging, connectivity, business, applications, payments, via, nfc, multimedia, playback, and, streaming, radio, television, digital, photography, and, video, games, mobile, phones, offering, only, basic, capabilities, are, known, as, feature, phones, slang, dumbphones, mobile, phones, that, offer, greatly, advanced, computing, capabilities, are, referred, to, as, smartphones, the, first, handheld, mobile, phone, was, demonstrated, by, martin, cooper, of, motorola, in, new, york, city, on, 3, april, 1973, using, a, handset, weighing, c, 2, kilograms, 4, 4, lbs, in, 1979, nippon, telegraph, and, telephone, ntt, launched, the, world, s, first, cellular, network, in, japan, in, 1983, the, dynatac, 8000x, was, the, first, commercially, available, handheld, mobile, phone, from, 1983, to, 2014, worldwide, mobile, phone, subscriptions, grew, to, over, seven, billion, enough, to, provide, one, for, every, person, on, earth, in, the, first, quarter, of, 2016, the, top, smartphone, developers, worldwide, were, samsung, apple, and, huawei, smartphone, sales, represented, 78, percent, of, total, mobile, phone, sales, for, feature, phones, as, of, 2016, the, top, selling, brands, were, samsung, nokia, and, alcatel, mobile, phones, are, considered, an, important, human, invention, as, they, have, been, one, of, the, most, widely, used, and, sold, pieces, of, consumer, technology, the, growth, in, popularity, has, been, rapid, in, some, places, for, example, in, the, uk, the, total, number, of, mobile, phones, overtook, the, number, of, houses, in, 1999, today, mobile, phones, are, globally, ubiquitous, and, in, almost, half, the, world, s, countries, over, 90, of, the, population, owns, at, least, one, a, handheld, mobile, radio, telephone, service, was, envisioned, in, the, early, stages, of, radio, engineering, in, 1917, finnish, inventor, eric, tigerstedt, filed, a, patent, for, a, pocket, size, folding, telephone, with, a, very, thin, carbon, microphone, early, predecessors, of, cellular, phones, included, analog, radio, communications, from, ships, and, trains, the, race, to, create, truly, portable, telephone, devices, began, after, world, war, ii, with, developments, taking, place, in, many, countries, the, advances, in, mobile, telephony, have, been, traced, in, successive, generations, starting, with, the, early, zeroth, generation, 0g, services, such, as, bell, system, s, mobile, telephone, service, and, its, successor, the, improved, mobile, telephone, service, these, 0g, systems, were, not, cellular, supported, a, few, simultaneous, calls, and, were, very, expensive, the, first, handheld, cellular, mobile, phone, was, demonstrated, by, john, f, mitchell, and, martin, cooper, of, motorola, in, 1973, using, a, handset, weighing, 2, kilograms, 4, 4, lb, the, first, commercial, automated, cellular, network, 1g, analog, was, launched, in, japan, by, nippon, telegraph, and, telephone, in, 1979, this, was, followed, in, 1981, by, the, simultaneous, launch, of, the, nordic, mobile, telephone, nmt, system, in, denmark, finland, norway, and, sweden, several, other, countries, then, followed, in, the, early, to, mid, 1980s, these, first, generation, 1g, systems, could, support, far, more, simultaneous, calls, but, still, used, analog, cellular, technology, in, 1983, the, dynatac, 8000x, was, the, first, commercially, available, handheld, mobile, phone, in, 1991, the, second, generation, 2g, digital, cellular, technology, was, launched, in, finland, by, radiolinja, on, the, gsm, standard, this, sparked, competition, in, the, sector, as, the, new, operators, challenged, the, incumbent, 1g, network, operators, the, gsm, standard, is, a, european, initiative, expressed, at, the, cept, conf, rence, europ, enne, des, postes, et, telecommunications, european, postal, and, telecommunications, conference, the, franco, german, r, d, cooperation, demonstrated, the, technical, feasibility, and, in, 1987, a, memorandum, of, understanding, was, signed, between, 13, european, countries, that, agreed, to, launch, a, commercial, service, by, 1991, the, first, version, of, the, gsm, standard, had, 6, 000, pages, the, ieee, and, rse, awarded, thomas, haug, and, philippe, dupuis, the, 2018, james, clerk, maxwell, medal, for, their, contributions, to, the, first, digital, mobile, telephone, standard, in, 2018, the, gsm, was, used, by, over, 5, billion, people, in, over, 220, countries, the, gsm, 2g, has, evolved, into, 3g, 4g, and, 5g, the, standardization, body, for, gsm, started, at, the, cept, working, group, gsm, group, special, mobile, in, 1982, under, the, umbrella, of, cept, in, 1988, etsi, was, established, and, all, cept, standardization, activities, were, transferred, to, etsi, working, group, gsm, became, technical, committee, gsm, in, 1991, it, became, technical, committee, smg, special, mobile, group, when, etsi, tasked, the, committee, with, umts, 3g, in, addition, to, transmitting, voice, over, digital, signals, the, 2g, network, introduced, data, services, for, mobile, starting, with, sms, text, messages, then, expanding, to, multimedia, messaging, service, mms, and, mobile, internet, with, a, theoretical, maximum, transfer, speed, of, 384, kbit, s, 48, kb, s, in, 2001, the, third, generation, 3g, was, launched, in, japan, by, ntt, docomo, on, the, wcdma, standard, this, was, followed, by, 3, 5g, or, 3g, enhancements, based, on, the, high, speed, packet, access, hspa, family, allowing, umts, networks, to, have, higher, data, transfer, speeds, and, capacity, 3g, is, able, to, provide, mobile, broadband, access, of, several, mbit, s, to, smartphones, and, mobile, modems, in, laptop, computers, this, ensures, it, can, be, applied, to, mobile, internet, access, voip, video, calls, and, sending, large, e, mail, messages, as, well, as, watching, videos, typically, in, standard, definition, quality, by, 2009, it, had, become, clear, that, at, some, point, 3g, networks, would, be, overwhelmed, by, the, growth, of, bandwidth, intensive, applications, such, as, streaming, media, consequently, the, industry, began, looking, to, data, optimized, fourth, generation, 4g, technologies, with, the, promise, of, speed, improvements, up, to, tenfold, over, existing, 3g, technologies, the, first, publicly, available, lte, service, was, launched, in, scandinavia, by, teliasonera, in, 2009, in, the, 2010s, 4g, technology, has, found, diverse, applications, across, various, sectors, showcasing, its, versatility, in, delivering, high, speed, wireless, communication, such, as, mobile, broadband, the, internet, of, things, iot, fixed, wireless, access, and, multimedia, streaming, including, music, video, radio, and, television, deployment, of, fifth, generation, 5g, cellular, networks, commenced, worldwide, in, 2019, the, term, 5g, was, originally, used, in, research, papers, and, projects, to, denote, the, next, major, phase, in, mobile, telecommunication, standards, beyond, the, 4g, imt, advanced, standards, the, 3gpp, defines, 5g, as, any, system, that, adheres, to, the, 5g, nr, 5g, new, radio, standard, 5g, can, be, implemented, in, low, band, mid, band, or, high, band, millimeter, wave, with, download, speeds, that, can, achieve, gigabit, per, second, gbit, s, range, aiming, for, a, network, latency, of, 1, ms, this, near, real, time, responsiveness, and, improved, overall, data, performance, are, crucial, for, applications, like, online, gaming, augmented, and, virtual, reality, autonomous, vehicles, iot, and, critical, communication, services, smartphones, have, a, number, of, distinguishing, features, the, international, telecommunication, union, measures, those, with, internet, connection, which, it, calls, active, mobile, broadband, subscriptions, which, includes, tablets, etc, in, the, developed, world, smartphones, have, now, overtaken, the, usage, of, earlier, mobile, systems, however, in, the, developing, world, they, account, for, around, 50, of, mobile, telephony, feature, phone, is, a, term, typically, used, as, a, retronym, to, describe, mobile, phones, which, are, limited, in, capabilities, in, contrast, to, a, modern, smartphone, feature, phones, typically, provide, voice, calling, and, text, messaging, functionality, in, addition, to, basic, multimedia, and, internet, capabilities, and, other, services, offered, by, the, user, s, wireless, service, provider, a, feature, phone, has, additional, functions, over, and, above, a, basic, mobile, phone, which, is, only, capable, of, voice, calling, and, text, messaging, feature, phones, and, basic, mobile, phones, tend, to, use, a, proprietary, custom, designed, software, and, user, interface, by, contrast, smartphones, generally, use, a, mobile, operating, system, that, often, shares, common, traits, across, devices, the, critical, advantage, that, modern, cellular, networks, have, over, predecessor, systems, is, the, concept, of, frequency, reuse, allowing, many, simultaneous, telephone, conversations, in, a, given, service, area, this, allows, efficient, use, of, the, limited, radio, spectrum, allocated, to, mobile, services, and, lets, thousands, of, subscribers, converse, at, the, same, time, within, a, given, geographic, area, former, systems, would, cover, a, service, area, with, one, or, two, powerful, base, stations, with, a, range, of, up, to, tens, of, kilometers, miles, using, only, a, few, sets, of, radio, channels, frequencies, once, these, few, channels, were, in, use, by, customers, no, further, customers, could, be, served, until, another, user, vacated, a, channel, it, would, be, impractical, to, give, every, customer, a, unique, channel, since, there, would, not, be, enough, bandwidth, allocated, to, the, mobile, service, as, well, technical, limitations, such, as, antenna, efficiency, and, receiver, design, limit, the, range, of, frequencies, a, customer, unit, could, use, a, cellular, network, mobile, phone, system, gets, its, name, from, dividing, the, service, area, into, many, small, cells, each, with, a, base, station, with, for, example, a, useful, range, on, the, order, of, a, kilometer, mile, these, systems, have, dozens, or, hundreds, of, possible, channels, allocated, to, them, when, a, subscriber, is, using, a, given, channel, for, a, telephone, connection, that, frequency, is, unavailable, for, other, customers, in, the, local, cell, and, in, the, adjacent, cells, however, cells, further, away, can, re, use, that, channel, without, interference, as, the, subscriber, s, handset, is, too, far, away, to, be, detected, the, transmitter, power, of, each, base, station, is, coordinated, to, efficiently, service, its, own, cell, but, not, to, interfere, with, the, cells, further, away, automation, embedded, in, the, customer, s, handset, and, in, the, base, stations, control, all, phases, of, the, call, from, detecting, the, presence, of, a, handset, in, a, service, area, temporary, assignment, of, a, channel, to, a, handset, making, a, call, interface, with, the, land, line, side, of, the, network, to, connect, to, other, subscribers, and, collection, of, billing, information, for, the, service, the, automation, systems, can, control, the, hand, off, of, a, customer, handset, moving, between, one, cell, and, another, so, that, a, call, in, progress, continues, without, interruption, changing, channels, if, required, in, the, earliest, mobile, phone, systems, by, contrast, all, control, was, done, manually, the, customer, would, search, for, an, unoccupied, channel, and, speak, to, a, mobile, operator, to, request, connection, of, a, call, to, a, landline, number, or, another, mobile, at, the, termination, of, the, call, the, mobile, operator, would, manually, record, the, billing, information, mobile, phones, communicate, with, cell, towers, that, are, placed, to, give, coverage, across, a, telephone, service, area, which, is, divided, up, into, cells, each, cell, uses, a, different, set, of, frequencies, from, neighboring, cells, and, will, typically, be, covered, by, three, towers, placed, at, different, locations, the, cell, towers, are, usually, interconnected, to, each, other, and, the, phone, network, and, the, internet, by, wired, connections, due, to, bandwidth, limitations, each, cell, will, have, a, maximum, number, of, cell, phones, it, can, handle, at, once, the, cells, are, therefore, sized, depending, on, the, expected, usage, density, and, may, be, much, smaller, in, cities, in, that, case, much, lower, transmitter, powers, are, used, to, avoid, broadcasting, beyond, the, cell, in, order, to, handle, the, high, traffic, multiple, towers, can, be, set, up, in, the, same, area, using, different, frequencies, this, can, be, done, permanently, or, temporarily, such, as, at, special, events, or, in, disasters, cell, phone, companies, will, bring, a, truck, with, equipment, to, host, the, abnormally, high, traffic, capacity, was, further, increased, when, phone, companies, implemented, digital, networks, with, digital, one, frequency, can, host, multiple, simultaneous, calls, additionally, short, range, wi, fi, infrastructure, is, often, used, by, smartphones, as, much, as, possible, as, it, offloads, traffic, from, cell, networks, on, to, local, area, networks, the, common, components, found, on, all, mobile, phones, are, low, end, mobile, phones, are, often, referred, to, as, feature, phones, and, offer, basic, telephony, handsets, with, more, advanced, computing, ability, through, the, use, of, native, software, applications, are, known, as, smartphones, the, first, gsm, phones, and, many, feature, phones, had, nor, flash, memory, from, which, processor, instructions, could, be, executed, directly, in, an, execute, in, place, architecture, and, allowed, for, short, boot, times, with, smartphones, nand, flash, memory, was, adopted, as, it, has, larger, storage, capacities, and, lower, costs, but, causes, longer, boot, times, because, instructions, cannot, be, executed, from, it, directly, and, must, be, copied, to, ram, memory, first, before, execution, mobile, phones, have, central, processing, units, cpus, similar, to, those, in, computers, but, optimised, to, operate, in, low, power, environments, mobile, cpu, performance, depends, not, only, on, the, clock, rate, generally, given, in, multiples, of, hertz, but, also, the, memory, hierarchy, also, greatly, affects, overall, performance, because, of, these, problems, the, performance, of, mobile, phone, cpus, is, often, more, appropriately, given, by, scores, derived, from, various, standardized, tests, to, measure, the, real, effective, performance, in, commonly, used, applications, one, of, the, main, characteristics, of, phones, is, the, screen, depending, on, the, device, s, type, and, design, the, screen, fills, most, or, nearly, all, of, the, space, on, a, device, s, front, surface, many, smartphone, displays, have, an, aspect, ratio, of, 16, 9, but, taller, aspect, ratios, became, more, common, in, 2017, screen, sizes, are, often, measured, in, diagonal, inches, or, millimeters, feature, phones, generally, have, screen, sizes, below, 90, millimetres, 3, 5, in, phones, with, screens, larger, than, 130, millimetres, 5, 2, in, are, often, called, phablets, smartphones, with, screens, over, 115, millimetres, 4, 5, in, in, size, are, commonly, difficult, to, use, with, only, a, single, hand, since, most, thumbs, cannot, reach, the, entire, screen, surface, they, may, need, to, be, shifted, around, in, the, hand, held, in, one, hand, and, manipulated, by, the, other, or, used, in, place, with, both, hands, due, to, design, advances, some, modern, smartphones, with, large, screen, sizes, and, edge, to, edge, designs, have, compact, builds, that, improve, their, ergonomics, while, the, shift, to, taller, aspect, ratios, have, resulted, in, phones, that, have, larger, screen, sizes, whilst, maintaining, the, ergonomics, associated, with, smaller, 16, 9, displays, liquid, crystal, displays, are, the, most, common, others, are, ips, led, oled, and, amoled, displays, some, displays, are, integrated, with, pressure, sensitive, digitizers, such, as, those, developed, by, wacom, and, samsung, and, apple, s, 3d, touch, system, in, sound, smartphones, and, feature, phones, vary, little, some, audio, quality, enhancing, features, such, as, voice, over, lte, and, hd, voice, have, appeared, and, are, often, available, on, newer, smartphones, sound, quality, can, remain, a, problem, due, to, the, design, of, the, phone, the, quality, of, the, cellular, network, and, compression, algorithms, used, in, long, distance, calls, audio, quality, can, be, improved, using, a, voip, application, over, wifi, cellphones, have, small, speakers, so, that, the, user, can, use, a, speakerphone, feature, and, talk, to, a, person, on, the, phone, without, holding, it, to, their, ear, the, small, speakers, can, also, be, used, to, listen, to, digital, audio, files, of, music, or, speech, or, watch, videos, with, an, audio, component, without, holding, the, phone, close, to, the, ear, the, average, phone, battery, lasts, two, three, years, at, best, many, of, the, wireless, devices, use, a, lithium, ion, li, ion, battery, which, charges, 500, 2500, times, depending, on, how, users, take, care, of, the, battery, and, the, charging, techniques, used, it, is, only, natural, for, these, rechargeable, batteries, to, chemically, age, which, is, why, the, performance, of, the, battery, when, used, for, a, year, or, two, will, begin, to, deteriorate, battery, life, can, be, extended, by, draining, it, regularly, not, overcharging, it, and, keeping, it, away, from, heat, mobile, phones, require, a, small, microchip, called, a, subscriber, identity, module, or, sim, card, in, order, to, function, the, sim, card, is, approximately, the, size, of, a, small, postage, stamp, and, is, usually, placed, underneath, the, battery, in, the, rear, of, the, unit, the, sim, securely, stores, the, service, subscriber, key, imsi, and, the, k, i, used, to, identify, and, authenticate, the, user, of, the, mobile, phone, the, sim, card, allows, users, to, change, phones, by, simply, removing, the, sim, card, from, one, mobile, phone, and, inserting, it, into, another, mobile, phone, or, broadband, telephony, device, provided, that, this, is, not, prevented, by, a, sim, lock, the, first, sim, card, was, made, in, 1991, by, munich, smart, card, maker, giesecke, devrient, for, the, finnish, wireless, network, operator, radiolinja, a, hybrid, mobile, phone, can, hold, up, to, four, sim, cards, with, a, phone, having, a, different, device, identifier, for, each, sim, card, sim, and, r, uim, cards, may, be, mixed, together, to, allow, both, gsm, and, cdma, networks, to, be, accessed, from, 2010, onwards, such, phones, became, popular, in, emerging, markets, and, this, was, attributed, to, the, desire, to, obtain, the, lowest, calling, costs, when, the, removal, of, a, sim, card, is, detected, by, the, operating, system, it, may, deny, further, operation, until, a, reboot, feature, phones, have, basic, software, platforms, smartphones, have, advanced, software, platforms, android, os, has, been, the, best, selling, os, worldwide, on, smartphones, since, 2011, a, mobile, app, is, a, computer, program, designed, to, run, on, a, mobile, device, such, as, a, smartphone, the, term, app, is, a, shortening, of, the, term, software, application, a, common, data, application, on, mobile, phones, is, short, message, service, sms, text, messaging, the, first, sms, message, was, sent, from, a, computer, to, a, mobile, phone, in, 1992, in, the, uk, while, the, first, person, to, person, sms, from, phone, to, phone, was, sent, in, finland, in, 1993, the, first, mobile, news, service, delivered, via, sms, was, launched, in, finland, in, 2000, and, subsequently, many, organizations, provided, on, demand, and, instant, news, services, by, sms, multimedia, messaging, service, mms, was, introduced, in, march, 2002, the, introduction, of, apple, s, app, store, for, the, iphone, and, ipod, touch, in, july, 2008, popularized, manufacturer, hosted, online, distribution, for, third, party, applications, software, and, computer, programs, focused, on, a, single, platform, there, are, a, huge, variety, of, apps, including, video, games, music, products, and, business, tools, up, until, that, point, smartphone, application, distribution, depended, on, third, party, sources, providing, applications, for, multiple, platforms, such, as, getjar, handango, handmark, and, pocketgear, following, the, success, of, the, app, store, other, smartphone, manufacturers, launched, application, stores, such, as, google, s, android, market, later, renamed, to, the, google, play, store, rim, s, blackberry, app, world, or, android, related, app, stores, like, aptoide, cafe, bazaar, f, droid, getjar, and, opera, mobile, store, in, february, 2014, 93, of, mobile, developers, were, targeting, smartphones, first, for, mobile, app, development, as, of, 2022, the, top, five, manufacturers, worldwide, were, samsung, 21, apple, 16, xiaomi, 13, oppo, 10, and, vivo, 9, from, 1983, to, 1998, motorola, was, market, leader, in, mobile, phones, nokia, was, the, market, leader, in, mobile, phones, from, 1998, to, 2012, in, q1, 2012, samsung, surpassed, nokia, selling, 93, 5, million, units, as, against, nokia, s, 82, 7, million, units, samsung, has, retained, its, top, position, since, then, aside, from, motorola, european, brands, such, as, nokia, siemens, and, ericsson, once, held, large, sway, over, the, global, mobile, phone, market, and, many, new, technologies, were, pioneered, in, europe, by, 2010, the, influence, of, european, companies, had, significantly, decreased, due, to, fierce, competition, from, american, and, asian, companies, to, where, most, technical, innovation, had, shifted, apple, and, google, both, of, the, united, states, also, came, to, dominate, mobile, phone, software, the, world, s, largest, individual, mobile, operator, by, number, of, subscribers, is, china, mobile, which, has, over, 902, million, mobile, phone, subscribers, as, of, june, 2018, over, 50, mobile, operators, have, over, ten, million, subscribers, each, and, over, 150, mobile, operators, had, at, least, one, million, subscribers, by, the, end, of, 2009, in, 2014, there, were, more, than, seven, billion, mobile, phone, subscribers, worldwide, a, number, that, is, expected, to, keep, growing, mobile, phones, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, such, as, keeping, in, touch, with, family, members, for, conducting, business, and, in, order, to, have, access, to, a, telephone, in, the, event, of, an, emergency, some, people, carry, more, than, one, mobile, phone, for, different, purposes, such, as, for, business, and, personal, use, multiple, sim, cards, may, be, used, to, take, advantage, of, the, benefits, of, different, calling, plans, for, example, a, particular, plan, might, provide, for, cheaper, local, calls, long, distance, calls, international, calls, or, roaming, the, mobile, phone, has, been, used, in, a, variety, of, diverse, contexts, in, society, for, example, in, 1998, one, of, the, first, examples, of, distributing, and, selling, media, content, through, the, mobile, phone, was, the, sale, of, ringtones, by, radiolinja, in, finland, soon, afterwards, other, media, content, appeared, such, as, news, video, games, jokes, horoscopes, tv, content, and, advertising, most, early, content, for, mobile, phones, tended, to, be, copies, of, legacy, media, such, as, banner, advertisements, or, tv, news, highlight, video, clips, recently, unique, content, for, mobile, phones, has, been, emerging, from, ringtones, and, ringback, tones, to, mobisodes, video, content, that, has, been, produced, exclusively, for, mobile, phones, in, many, countries, mobile, phones, are, used, to, provide, mobile, banking, services, which, may, include, the, ability, to, transfer, cash, payments, by, secure, sms, text, message, kenya, s, m, pesa, mobile, banking, service, for, example, allows, customers, of, the, mobile, phone, operator, safaricom, to, hold, cash, balances, which, are, recorded, on, their, sim, cards, cash, can, be, deposited, or, withdrawn, from, m, pesa, accounts, at, safaricom, retail, outlets, located, throughout, the, country, and, can, be, transferred, electronically, from, person, to, person, and, used, to, pay, bills, to, companies, branchless, banking, has, also, been, successful, in, south, africa, and, the, philippines, a, pilot, project, in, bali, was, launched, in, 2011, by, the, international, finance, corporation, and, an, indonesian, bank, bank, mandiri, mobile, payments, were, first, trialled, in, finland, in, 1998, when, two, coca, cola, vending, machines, in, espoo, were, enabled, to, work, with, sms, payments, eventually, the, idea, spread, and, in, 1999, the, philippines, launched, the, country, s,

complexity, of, mobile, phones, they, are, often, more, like, mobile, computers, in, their, available, uses, this, has, introduced, additional, difficulties, for, law, enforcement, officials, when, attempting, to, distinguish, one, usage, from, another, in, drivers, using, their, devices, this, is, more, apparent, in, countries, which, ban, both, handheld, and, hands, free, usage, rather, than, those, which, ban, handheld, use, only, as, officials, cannot, easily, tell, which, function, of, the, mobile, phone, is, being, used, simply, by, looking, at, the, driver, this, can, lead, to, drivers, being, stopped, for, using, their, device, illegally, for, a, phone, call, when, in, fact, they, were, using, the, device, legally, for, example, when, using, the, phone, s, incorporated,

cause, cancer, but, this, is, a, myth, while, there, are, rumors, of, mobile, phones, causing, cancer, there, was, a, study, conducted, by, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, that, stated, the, there, could, be, an, increase, risk, of, brain, tumors, with, the, use, of, smartphones, this, is, not, confirmed, they, also, stated, that, with, the, lack, of, data, for, the, research, and, the, usage, periods, of, 15, years, will, warrant, further, research, for, smartphones, and, the, cause, of, brain, tumors, a, study, by, the, london, school, of, economics, found,

examples, of, devices, that, were, popular, for, being, fashionable, while, not, necessarily, focusing, on, the, original, purpose, of, mobile, phones, i, e, a, device, to, provide, mobile, telephony, some, have, also, suggested, that, mobile, phones, or, smartphones, are, a, status, symbol, for, example, a, research, paper, suggested, that, owning, specifically, an, apple, iphone, was, seen, to, be, a, status, symbol, text, messaging, which, are, performed, on, mobile, phones, has, also, led, to, the, creation, of, sms, language, it, also, led, to, the, growing, popularity, of, emojis
