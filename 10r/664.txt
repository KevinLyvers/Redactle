a, road, is, a, thoroughfare, for, the, conveyance, of, traffic, that, mostly, has, an, improved, surface, for, use, by, vehicles, motorized, and, non, motorized, and, pedestrians, unlike, streets, whose, primary, function, is, to, serve, as, public, spaces, the, main, function, of, roads, is, transportation, there, are, many, types, of, roads, including, parkways, avenues, controlled, access, highways, freeways, motorways, and, expressways, tollways, interstates, highways, thoroughfares, and, local, roads, the, primary, features, of, roads, include, lanes, sidewalks, pavement, roadways, carriageways, medians, shoulders, verges, bike, paths, cycle, paths, and, shared, use, paths, historically, many, roads, were, simply, recognizable, routes, without, any, formal, construction, or, some, maintenance, the, organization, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, defines, a, road, as, a, line, of, communication, travelled, way, using, a, stabilized, base, other, than, rails, or, air, strips, open, to, public, traffic, primarily, for, the, use, of, road, motor, vehicles, running, on, their, own, wheels, which, includes, bridges, tunnels, supporting, structures, junctions, crossings, interchanges, and, toll, roads, but, not, cycle, paths, the, eurostat, itf, and, unece, glossary, for, transport, statistics, illustrated, defines, a, road, as, a, line, of, communication, traveled, way, open, to, public, traffic, primarily, for, the, use, of, road, motor, vehicles, using, a, stabilized, base, other, than, rails, or, air, strips, included, are, paved, roads, and, other, roads, with, a, stabilized, base, e, g, gravel, roads, roads, also, cover, streets, bridges, tunnels, supporting, structures, junctions, crossings, and, interchanges, toll, roads, are, also, included, excluded, are, dedicated, cycle, lanes, the, 1968, vienna, convention, on, road, traffic, defines, a, road, as, the, entire, surface, of, any, way, or, street, open, to, public, traffic, in, urban, areas, roads, may, diverge, through, a, city, or, village, and, be, named, as, streets, serving, a, dual, function, as, urban, space, easement, and, route, modern, roads, are, normally, smoothed, paved, or, otherwise, prepared, to, allow, easy, travel, part, 2, division, 1, clauses, 11, 13, of, the, national, transport, commission, regulations, 2006, defines, a, road, in, australia, as, an, area, that, is, open, to, or, used, by, the, public, and, is, developed, for, or, has, as, one, of, its, main, uses, the, driving, or, riding, of, motor, vehicles, further, it, defines, a, shoulder, typical, an, area, of, the, road, outside, the, edge, line, or, the, curb, and, a, road, related, area, which, includes, green, areas, separating, roads, areas, designated, for, cyclists, and, areas, generally, accessible, to, the, public, for, driving, riding, or, parking, vehicles, in, new, zealand, the, definition, of, a, road, is, broad, in, common, law, where, the, statutory, definition, includes, areas, the, public, has, access, to, by, right, or, not, beaches, publicly, accessible, car, parks, and, yards, even, if, privately, owned, river, beds, road, shoulders, verges, wharves, and, bridges, are, included, however, the, definition, of, a, road, for, insurance, purposes, may, be, restricted, to, reduce, risk, in, the, united, kingdom, the, highway, code, details, rules, for, road, users, but, there, is, some, ambiguity, between, the, terms, highway, and, road, for, the, purposes, of, the, english, law, highways, act, 1980, which, covers, england, and, wales, but, not, scotland, or, northern, ireland, road, is, any, length, of, highway, or, of, any, other, road, to, which, the, public, has, access, and, includes, bridges, over, which, a, road, passes, this, includes, footpaths, bridleways, and, cycle, tracks, and, also, road, and, driveways, on, private, land, and, many, car, parks, vehicle, excise, duty, a, road, use, tax, is, payable, on, some, vehicles, used, on, the, public, road, the, definition, of, a, road, depends, on, the, definition, of, a, highway, there, is, no, formal, definition, for, a, highway, in, the, relevant, act, a, 1984, ruling, said, the, land, over, which, a, public, right, of, way, exists, is, known, as, a, highway, and, although, most, highways, have, been, made, up, into, roads, and, most, easements, of, way, exist, over, footpaths, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, made, road, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, distinction, another, legal, view, is, that, while, a, highway, historically, included, footpaths, bridleways, driftways, etc, it, can, now, be, used, to, mean, those, ways, that, allow, the, movement, of, motor, vehicles, and, the, term, rights, of, way, can, be, used, to, cover, the, wider, usage, in, the, united, states, laws, distinguish, between, public, roads, which, are, open, to, public, use, and, private, roads, which, are, privately, controlled, the, assertion, that, the, first, pathways, were, the, trails, made, by, animals, has, not, been, universally, accepted, in, many, cases, animals, do, not, follow, constant, paths, some, believe, that, some, roads, originated, from, following, animal, trails, the, icknield, way, may, exemplify, this, type, of, road, origination, where, human, and, animal, both, selected, the, same, natural, line, by, about, 10, 000, bc, human, travelers, used, rough, roads, pathways, in, transport, engineering, subgrade, is, the, native, material, underneath, a, constructed, road, road, construction, requires, the, creation, of, an, engineered, continuous, right, of, way, or, roadbed, overcoming, geographic, obstacles, and, having, grades, low, enough, to, permit, vehicle, or, foot, travel, 15, and, may, be, required, to, meet, standards, set, by, law, or, official, guidelines, the, process, is, often, begun, with, the, removal, of, earth, and, rock, by, digging, or, blasting, construction, of, embankments, bridges, and, tunnels, and, removal, of, vegetation, this, may, involve, deforestation, and, followed, by, the, laying, of, pavement, material, a, variety, of, road, building, equipment, is, employed, in, road, building, after, design, approval, planning, legal, and, environmental, considerations, have, been, addressed, alignment, of, the, road, is, set, out, by, a, surveyor, the, radii, and, gradient, are, designed, and, staked, out, to, best, suit, the, natural, ground, levels, and, minimize, the, amount, of, cut, and, fill, 34, great, care, is, taken, to, preserve, reference, benchmarks, 59, roads, are, designed, and, built, for, primary, use, by, vehicular, and, pedestrian, traffic, storm, drainage, and, environmental, considerations, are, a, major, concern, erosion, and, sediment, controls, are, constructed, to, prevent, detrimental, effects, drainage, lines, are, laid, with, sealed, joints, in, the, road, easement, with, runoff, coefficients, and, characteristics, adequate, for, the, land, zoning, and, storm, water, system, drainage, systems, must, be, capable, of, carrying, the, ultimate, design, flow, from, the, upstream, catchment, with, approval, for, the, outfall, from, the, appropriate, authority, to, a, watercourse, creek, river, or, the, sea, for, drainage, discharge, 38, 40, a, borrow, pit, source, for, obtaining, fill, gravel, and, rock, and, a, water, source, should, be, located, near, or, in, reasonable, distance, to, the, road, construction, site, approval, from, local, authorities, may, be, required, to, draw, water, or, for, working, crushing, and, screening, of, materials, for, construction, needs, the, topsoil, and, vegetation, is, removed, from, the, borrow, pit, and, stockpiled, for, subsequent, rehabilitation, of, the, extraction, area, side, slopes, in, the, excavation, area, not, steeper, than, one, vertical, to, two, horizontal, for, safety, reasons, 53, 56, old, road, surfaces, fences, and, buildings, may, need, to, be, removed, before, construction, can, begin, trees, in, the, road, construction, area, may, be, marked, for, retention, these, protected, trees, should, not, have, the, topsoil, within, the, area, of, the, tree, s, drip, line, removed, and, the, area, should, be, kept, clear, of, construction, material, and, equipment, compensation, or, replacement, may, be, required, if, a, protected, tree, is, damaged, much, of, the, vegetation, may, be, mulched, and, put, aside, for, use, during, reinstatement, the, topsoil, is, usually, stripped, and, stockpiled, nearby, for, rehabilitation, of, newly, constructed, embankments, along, the, road, stumps, and, roots, are, removed, and, holes, filled, as, required, before, the, earthwork, begins, final, rehabilitation, after, road, construction, is, completed, will, include, seeding, planting, watering, and, other, activities, to, reinstate, the, area, to, be, consistent, with, the, untouched, surrounding, areas, 66, 67, processes, during, earthwork, include, excavation, removal, of, material, to, spoil, filling, compacting, construction, and, trimming, if, rock, or, other, unsuitable, material, is, discovered, it, is, removed, moisture, content, is, managed, and, replaced, with, standard, fill, compacted, to, meet, the, design, requirements, generally, 90, 95, relative, compaction, blasting, is, not, frequently, used, to, excavate, the, roadbed, as, the, intact, rock, structure, forms, an, ideal, road, base, when, a, depression, must, be, filled, to, come, up, to, the, road, grade, the, native, bed, is, compacted, after, the, topsoil, has, been, removed, the, fill, is, made, by, the, compacted, layer, method, where, a, layer, of, fill, is, spread, then, compacted, to, specifications, under, saturated, conditions, the, process, is, repeated, until, the, desired, grade, is, reached, 68, 69, general, fill, material, should, be, free, of, organics, meet, minimum, california, bearing, ratio, cbr, results, and, have, a, low, plasticity, index, the, lower, fill, generally, comprises, sand, or, a, sand, rich, mixture, with, fine, gravel, which, acts, as, an, inhibitor, to, the, growth, of, plants, or, other, vegetable, matter, the, compacted, fill, also, serves, as, lower, stratum, drainage, select, second, fill, sieved, should, be, composed, of, gravel, decomposed, rock, or, broken, rock, below, a, specified, particle, size, and, be, free, of, large, lumps, of, clay, sand, clay, fill, may, also, be, used, the, roadbed, must, be, proof, rolled, after, each, layer, of, fill, is, compacted, if, a, roller, passes, over, an, area, without, creating, visible, deformation, or, spring, the, section, is, deemed, to, comply, 70, 72, geosynthetics, such, as, geotextiles, geogrids, and, geocells, are, frequently, used, in, the, various, pavement, layers, to, improve, road, quality, these, materials, and, methods, are, used, in, low, traffic, private, roadways, as, well, as, public, roads, and, highways, geosynthetics, perform, four, main, functions, in, roads, separation, reinforcement, filtration, and, drainage, which, increase, the, pavement, performance, reduce, construction, costs, and, decrease, maintenance, the, completed, roadway, is, finished, by, paving, or, left, with, a, gravel, or, other, natural, surface, the, type, of, road, surface, is, dependent, on, economic, factors, and, expected, usage, safety, improvements, such, as, traffic, signs, crash, barriers, raised, pavement, markers, and, other, forms, of, road, surface, marking, are, installed, according, to, a, may, 2009, report, by, the, american, association, of, state, highway, and, transportation, officials, aashto, and, trip, a, national, transportation, research, organization, driving, on, rough, roads, costs, the, average, american, motorist, approximately, 400, a, year, in, extra, vehicle, operating, costs, drivers, living, in, urban, areas, with, populations, more, than, 250, 000, are, paying, upwards, of, 750, more, annually, because, of, accelerated, vehicle, deterioration, increased, maintenance, additional, fuel, consumption, and, tire, wear, caused, by, poor, road, conditions, when, a, single, carriageway, road, is, converted, into, dual, carriageway, by, building, a, second, separate, carriageway, alongside, the, first, it, is, usually, referred, to, as, duplication, twinning, or, doubling, the, original, carriageway, is, changed, from, two, way, to, become, one, way, while, the, new, carriageway, is, one, way, in, the, opposite, direction, in, the, same, way, as, converting, railway, lines, from, single, track, to, double, track, the, new, carriageway, is, not, always, constructed, directly, alongside, the, existing, carriageway, roads, that, are, intended, for, use, by, a, particular, mode, of, transport, can, be, reallocated, for, another, mode, of, transport, i, e, by, using, traffic, signs, for, instance, in, the, ongoing, road, space, reallocation, effort, some, roads, particularly, in, city, centers, which, are, intended, for, use, by, cars, are, increasingly, being, repurposed, for, cycling, and, or, walking, like, all, structures, roads, deteriorate, over, time, deterioration, is, primarily, due, to, environmental, effects, such, as, frost, heaves, thermal, cracking, and, oxidation, often, contribute, however, accumulated, damage, from, vehicles, also, contributes, according, to, a, series, of, experiments, carried, out, in, the, late, 1950s, called, the, aasho, road, test, it, was, empirically, determined, that, the, effective, damage, done, to, the, road, is, roughly, proportional, to, the, fourth, power, of, axle, weight, a, typical, tractor, trailer, weighing, 80, 000, pounds, 36, 287, t, with, 8, 000, pounds, 3, 629, t, on, the, steer, axle, and, 36, 000, pounds, 16, 329, t, on, both, of, the, tandem, axle, groups, is, expected, to, do, 7, 800, times, more, damage, than, a, passenger, vehicle, with, 2, 000, pounds, 0, 907, t, on, each, axle, potholes, on, roads, are, caused, by, rain, damage, and, vehicle, braking, or, related, construction, work, pavements, are, designed, for, an, expected, service, life, or, design, life, in, some, parts, of, the, united, kingdom, the, standard, design, life, is, 40, years, for, new, bitumen, and, concrete, pavement, maintenance, is, considered, in, the, whole, life, cost, of, the, road, with, service, at, 10, 20, and, 30, year, milestones, roads, can, be, and, are, designed, for, a, variety, of, lives, 8, 15, 30, and, 60, year, designs, when, pavement, lasts, longer, than, its, intended, life, it, may, have, been, overbuilt, and, the, original, costs, may, have, been, too, high, when, a, pavement, fails, before, its, intended, design, life, the, owner, may, have, excessive, repair, and, rehabilitation, costs, some, asphalt, pavements, are, designed, as, perpetual, pavements, with, an, expected, structural, life, in, excess, of, 50, years, many, asphalt, pavements, built, over, 35, years, ago, despite, not, being, specifically, designed, as, a, perpetual, pavement, have, remained, in, good, condition, long, past, their, design, life, many, concrete, pavements, built, since, the, 1950s, have, significantly, outlived, their, intended, design, lives, some, roads, like, chicago, s, wacker, drive, a, major, two, level, and, at, one, point, three, level, roadway, in, the, downtown, area, are, being, rebuilt, with, a, designed, service, life, of, 100, years, virtually, all, roads, require, some, form, of, maintenance, before, they, come, to, the, end, of, their, service, life, pro, active, agencies, use, pavement, management, techniques, to, continually, monitor, road, conditions, and, schedule, preventive, maintenance, treatments, as, needed, to, prolong, the, lifespan, of, their, roads, technically, advanced, agencies, monitor, the, road, network, surface, condition, with, sophisticated, equipment, such, as, laser, inertial, profilometers, these, measurements, include, road, curvature, cross, slope, asperity, roughness, rutting, and, texture, software, algorithms, use, this, data, to, recommend, maintenance, or, new, construction, maintenance, treatments, for, asphalt, concrete, generally, include, thin, asphalt, overlays, crack, sealing, surface, rejuvenating, fog, sealing, micro, milling, or, diamond, grinding, and, surface, treatments, thin, surfacing, preserves, protects, and, improves, the, functional, condition, of, the, road, while, reducing, the, need, for, routing, maintenance, leading, to, extended, service, life, without, increasing, structural, capacity, older, concrete, pavements, that, develop, faults, can, be, repaired, with, a, dowel, bar, retrofit, in, which, slots, are, cut, in, the, pavement, at, each, joint, and, dowel, bars, are, placed, in, the, slots, which, are, then, filled, with, concrete, patching, material, this, can, extend, the, life, of, the, concrete, pavement, for, 15, years, failure, to, maintain, roads, properly, can, create, significant, costs, to, society, a, 2009, report, released, by, the, american, association, of, state, highway, and, transportation, officials, estimated, that, about, 50, of, the, roads, in, the, us, are, in, bad, condition, with, urban, areas, worse, the, report, estimates, that, urban, drivers, pay, an, average, of, 746, year, on, vehicle, repairs, while, the, average, us, motorist, pays, about, 335, year, in, contrast, the, average, motorist, pays, about, 171, year, in, road, maintenance, taxes, based, on, 600, gallons, year, and, 0, 285, gallon, tax, distress, and, serviceability, loss, on, concrete, roads, can, be, caused, by, loss, of, support, due, to, voids, beneath, the, concrete, pavement, slabs, the, voids, usually, occur, near, cracks, or, joints, due, to, surface, water, infiltration, the, most, common, causes, of, voids, are, pumping, consolidation, subgrade, failure, and, bridge, approach, failure, slab, stabilization, is, a, non, destructive, method, of, solving, this, problem, and, is, usually, employed, with, other, concrete, pavement, restoration, methods, including, patching, and, diamond, grinding, the, technique, restores, support, to, concrete, slabs, by, filing, small, voids, that, develop, underneath, the, concrete, slab, at, joints, cracks, or, the, pavement, edge, the, process, consists, of, pumping, a, cementitious, grout, or, polyurethane, mixture, through, holes, drilled, through, the, slab, the, grout, can, fill, small, voids, beneath, the, slab, and, or, sub, base, the, grout, also, displaces, free, water, and, helps, keep, water, from, saturating, and, weakening, support, under, the, joints, and, slab, edge, after, stabilization, is, complete, the, three, steps, for, this, method, after, finding, the, voids, are, locating, and, drilling, holes, grout, injection, and, post, testing, the, stabilized, slabs, slab, stabilization, does, not, correct, depressions, increase, the, design, structural, capacity, stop, erosion, or, eliminate, faulting, it, does, however, restore, the, slab, support, therefore, decreasing, deflections, under, the, load, stabilization, should, only, be, performed, at, joints, and, cracks, where, the, loss, of, support, exists, visual, inspection, is, the, simplest, manner, to, find, voids, signs, that, repair, is, needed, are, transverse, joint, faulting, corner, breaks, and, shoulder, drop, off, and, lines, at, or, near, joints, and, cracks, deflection, testing, is, another, common, procedure, used, to, locate, voids, it, is, recommended, to, do, this, testing, at, night, as, during, cooler, temperatures, joints, open, aggregate, interlock, diminishes, and, load, deflections, are, at, their, highest, ground, penetrating, radar, pulses, electromagnetic, waves, into, the, pavement, and, measures, and, graphically, displays, the, reflected, signal, this, can, reveal, voids, and, other, defects, the, epoxy, core, test, detects, voids, by, visual, and, mechanical, methods, it, consists, of, drilling, a, 25, to, 50, millimeter, hole, through, the, pavement, into, the, sub, base, with, a, dry, bit, roto, hammer, next, a, two, part, epoxy, is, poured, into, the, hole, dyed, for, visual, clarity, once, the, epoxy, hardens, technicians, drill, through, the, hole, if, a, void, is, present, the, epoxy, will, stick, to, the, core, and, provide, physical, evidence, common, stabilization, materials, include, pozzolan, cement, grout, and, polyurethane, the, requirements, for, slab, stabilization, are, strength, and, the, ability, to, flow, into, or, expand, to, fill, small, voids, colloidal, mixing, equipment, is, necessary, to, use, the, pozzolan, cement, grouts, the, contractor, must, place, the, grout, using, a, positive, displacement, injection, pump, or, a, non, pulsing, progressive, cavity, pump, a, drill, is, also, necessary, but, it, must, produce, a, clean, hole, with, no, surface, spalling, or, breakouts, the, injection, devices, must, include, a, grout, packer, capable, of, sealing, the, hole, the, injection, device, must, also, have, a, return, hose, or, a, fast, control, reverse, switch, in, case, workers, detect, slab, movement, on, the, uplift, gauge, the, uplift, beam, helps, to, monitor, the, slab, deflection, and, has, to, have, sensitive, dial, gauges, also, called, joint, and, crack, repair, this, method, s, purpose, is, to, minimize, infiltration, of, surface, water, and, incompressible, material, into, the, joint, system, joint, sealants, are, also, used, to, reduce, dowel, bar, corrosion, in, concrete, pavement, restoration, techniques, successful, resealing, consists, of, old, sealant, removal, shaping, and, cleaning, the, reservoir, installing, the, backer, rod, and, installing, the, sealant, sawing, manual, removal, plowing, and, cutting, are, methods, used, to, remove, the, old, sealant, saws, are, used, to, shape, the, reservoir, when, cleaning, the, reservoir, no, dust, dirt, or, traces, of, old, sealant, should, remain, thus, it, is, recommended, to, water, wash, sand, blast, and, then, air, blow, to, remove, any, sand, dirt, or, dust, the, backer, rod, installation, requires, a, double, wheeled, steel, roller, to, insert, the, rod, to, the, desired, depth, after, inserting, the, backer, rod, the, sealant, is, placed, into, the, joint, there, are, various, materials, to, choose, for, this, method, including, hot, pour, bituminous, liquid, silicone, and, preformed, compression, seals, careful, design, and, construction, of, roads, can, increase, road, traffic, safety, and, reduce, the, harm, deaths, injuries, and, property, damage, on, the, highway, system, from, traffic, collisions, on, neighborhood, roads, traffic, calming, safety, barriers, pedestrian, crossings, and, cycle, lanes, can, help, protect, pedestrians, cyclists, and, drivers, lane, markers, in, some, countries, and, states, are, marked, with, cat, s, eyes, or, botts, dots, botts, dots, are, not, used, where, it, is, icy, in, the, winter, because, frost, and, snowplows, can, break, the, glue, that, holds, them, to, the, road, although, they, can, be, embedded, in, short, shallow, trenches, carved, in, the, roadway, as, is, done, in, the, mountainous, regions, of, california, for, major, roads, risk, can, be, reduced, by, providing, limited, access, from, properties, and, local, roads, grade, separated, junctions, and, median, dividers, between, opposite, direction, traffic, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, head, on, collisions, the, placement, of, energy, attenuation, devices, e, g, guardrails, wide, grassy, areas, sand, barrels, is, also, common, some, road, fixtures, such, as, road, signs, and, fire, hydrants, are, designed, to, collapse, on, impact, light, poles, are, designed, to, break, at, the, base, rather, than, violently, stop, a, car, that, hits, them, highway, authorities, may, also, remove, larger, trees, from, the, immediate, vicinity, of, the, road, during, heavy, rains, if, the, elevation, of, the, road, surface, is, not, higher, than, the, surrounding, landscape, it, may, result, in, flooding, speed, limits, can, improve, road, traffic, safety, and, reduce, the, number, of, road, traffic, casualties, from, traffic, collisions, in, their, world, report, on, road, traffic, injury, prevention, report, the, world, health, organization, who, identify, speed, control, as, one, of, various, interventions, likely, to, contribute, to, a, reduction, in, road, casualties, road, conditions, are, the, collection, of, factors, describing, the, ease, of, driving, on, a, particular, stretch, of, road, or, on, the, roads, of, a, particular, locality, including, the, quality, of, the, pavement, surface, potholes, road, markings, and, weather, it, has, been, reported, that, roblems, of, transportation, participants, and, road, conditions, are, the, main, factors, that, lead, to, road, traffic, accidents, it, has, further, been, specifically, noted, that, weather, conditions, and, road, conditions, are, interlinked, as, weather, conditions, affect, the, road, conditions, specific, aspects, of, road, conditions, can, be, of, particular, importance, for, particular, purposes, for, example, for, autonomous, vehicles, such, as, self, driving, cars, significant, road, conditions, can, include, shadowing, and, lighting, changes, road, surface, texture, changes, and, road, markings, consisting, of, circular, reflectors, dashed, lines, and, solid, lines, various, government, agencies, and, private, entities, including, local, news, services, track, and, report, on, road, conditions, to, the, public, so, that, drivers, going, through, a, particular, area, can, be, aware, of, hazards, that, may, exist, in, that, area, news, agencies, in, turn, rely, on, tips, from, area, residents, with, respect, to, certain, aspects, of, road, conditions, in, their, coverage, area, careful, design, and, construction, of, a, road, can, reduce, any, negative, environmental, impacts, water, management, systems, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, effect, of, pollutants, from, roads, rainwater, and, snowmelt, running, off, of, roads, tends, to, pick, up, gasoline, motor, oil, heavy, metals, trash, and, other, pollutants, and, result, in, water, pollution, road, runoff, is, a, major, source, of, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, and, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, which, are, created, as, combustion, byproducts, of, gasoline, and, other, fossil, fuels, de, icing, chemicals, and, sand, can, run, off, into, roadsides, contaminate, groundwater, and, pollute, surface, waters, and, road, salts, can, be, toxic, to, sensitive, plants, and, animals, sand, applied, to, icy, roads, can, be, ground, up, by, traffic, into, fine, particulates, and, contribute, to, air, pollution, roads, are, a, chief, source, of, noise, pollution, in, the, early, 1970s, it, was, recognized, that, design, of, roads, can, be, conducted, to, influence, and, minimize, noise, generation, noise, barriers, can, reduce, noise, pollution, near, built, up, areas, regulations, can, restrict, the, use, of, engine, braking, motor, vehicle, emissions, contribute, air, pollution, concentrations, of, air, pollutants, and, adverse, respiratory, health, effects, are, greater, near, the, road, than, at, some, distance, away, from, the, road, road, dust, kicked, up, by, vehicles, may, trigger, allergic, reactions, in, addition, on, road, transportation, greenhouse, gas, emissions, are, the, largest, single, cause, of, climate, change, scientists, say, traffic, flows, on, the, right, or, on, the, left, side, of, the, road, depending, on, the, country, in, countries, where, traffic, flows, on, the, right, traffic, signs, are, mostly, on, the, right, side, of, the, road, roundabouts, and, traffic, circles, go, counter, clockwise, anti, clockwise, and, pedestrians, crossing, a, two, way, road, should, watch, out, for, traffic, from, the, left, first, in, countries, where, traffic, flows, on, the, left, the, reverse, is, true, about, 33, of, the, world, by, population, drive, on, the, left, and, 67, keep, right, by, road, distances, about, 28, drive, on, the, left, and, 72, on, the, right, even, though, originally, most, traffic, drove, on, the, left, worldwide, transport, economics, is, used, to, understand, both, the, relationship, between, the, transport, system, and, the, wider, economy, and, the, complex, effects, of, the, road, network, structure, when, there, are, multiple, paths, and, competing, modes, for, both, personal, and, freight, road, rail, air, ferry, and, where, induced, demand, can, result, in, increased, on, decreased, transport, levels, when, road, provision, is, increased, by, building, new, roads, or, decreased, for, example, california, state, route, 480, roads, are, generally, built, and, maintained, by, the, public, sector, using, taxation, although, implementation, may, be, through, private, contractors, or, occasionally, using, road, tolls, public, private, partnerships, are, a, way, for, communities, to, address, the, rising, cost, by, injecting, private, funds, into, the, infrastructure, there, are, four, main, ones, society, depends, heavily, on, efficient, roads, in, the, european, union, eu, 44, of, all, goods, are, moved, by, trucks, over, roads, and, 85, of, all, people, are, transported, by, cars, buses, or, coaches, on, roads, the, term, was, also, commonly, used, to, refer, to, roadsteads, waterways, that, lent, themselves, to, use, by, shipping, according, to, the, new, york, state, thruway, authority, some, sample, per, mile, costs, to, construct, multi, lane, roads, in, several, us, northeastern, states, were, the, united, states, has, the, largest, network, of, roads, of, any, country, with, 4, 050, 717, miles, 6, 518, 997, km, as, of, 2009, the, republic, of, india, has, the, second, largest, road, system, globally, with, 4, 689, 842, kilometres, 2, 914, 133, miles, of, road, 2013, the, people, s, republic, of, china, is, third, with, 3, 583, 715, kilometres, 2, 226, 817, mi, of, road, 2007, the, federative, republic, of, brazil, has, the, fourth, largest, road, system, in, the, world, with, 1, 751, 868, kilometres, 1, 088, 560, mi, 2002, see, list, of, countries, by, road, network, size, when, looking, only, at, expressways, the, national, trunk, highway, system, nths, in, china, has, a, total, length, of, 45, 000, kilometres, 28, 000, mi, at, the, end, of, 2006, and, 60, 300, km, at, the, end, of, 2008, second, only, to, the, united, states, with, 90, 000, kilometres, 56, 000, mi, in, 2005, however, as, of, 2017, china, has, 130, 000, km, of, expressways, eurasia, africa, north, america, south, america, and, australia, each, have, an, extensive, road, network, that, connects, most, cities, the, north, and, south, american, road, networks, are, separated, by, the, dari, n, gap, the, only, interruption, in, the, pan, american, highway, eurasia, and, africa, are, connected, by, roads, on, the, sinai, peninsula, the, european, peninsula, is, connected, to, the, scandinavian, peninsula, by, the, resund, bridge, and, both, have, many, connections, to, the, mainland, of, eurasia, including, the, bridges, over, the, bosphorus, antarctica, has, very, few, roads, and, no, continent, bridging, network, though, there, are, a, few, ice, roads, between, bases, such, as, the, south, pole, traverse, bahrain, is, the, only, island, country, to, be, connected, to, a, continental, network, by, road, the, king, fahd, causeway, to, saudi, arabia, even, well, connected, road, networks, are, controlled, by, many, different, legal, jurisdictions, and, laws, such, as, which, side, of, the, road, to, drive, on, vary, accordingly, many, populated, domestic, islands, are, connected, to, the, mainland, by, bridges, a, very, long, example, is, the, 113, mi, 182, km, overseas, highway, connecting, many, of, the, florida, keys, with, the, continental, united, states, even, on, mainlands, some, settlements, have, no, roads, connecting, with, the, primary, continental, network, due, to, natural, obstacles, like, mountains, or, wetlands, or, high, cost, compared, to, the, population, served, unpaved, roads, or, lack, of, roads, are, more, common, in, developing, countries, and, these, can, become, impassible, in, wet, conditions, as, of, 2014, only, 43, of, rural, africans, have, access, to, an, all, season, road, due, to, steepness, mud, snow, or, fords, roads, can, sometimes, be, passable, only, to, four, wheel, drive, vehicles, those, with, snow, chains, or, snow, tires, or, those, capable, of, deep, wading, or, amphibious, operation, most, disconnected, settlements, have, local, road, networks, connecting, ports, buildings, and, other, points, of, interest, where, demand, for, travel, by, road, vehicle, to, a, disconnected, island, or, mainland, settlement, is, high, roll, on, roll, off, ferries, are, commonly, available, if, the, journey, is, relatively, short, for, long, distance, trips, passengers, usually, travel, by, air, and, rent, a, car, upon, arrival, if, facilities, are, available, vehicles, and, cargo, can, also, be, shipped, to, many, disconnected, settlements, by, boat, or, air, transport, at, much, greater, expense, the, island, of, great, britain, is, connected, to, the, european, road, network, by, eurotunnel, shuttle, an, example, of, a, car, shuttle, train, which, is, a, service, used, in, other, parts, of, europe, to, travel, under, mountains, and, over, wetlands, in, polar, areas, disconnected, settlements, are, often, more, easily, reached, by, snowmobile, or, dogsled, in, cold, weather, which, can, produce, sea, ice, that, blocks, ports, and, bad, weather, that, prevents, flying, for, example, resupply, aircraft, are, only, flown, to, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, october, to, february, and, many, residents, of, coastal, alaska, have, bulk, cargo, shipped, in, only, during, the, warmer, months, permanent, darkness, during, the, winter, can, also, make, long, distance, travel, more, dangerous, in, polar, areas, continental, road, networks, do, reach, into, these, areas, such, as, the, dalton, highway, to, the, north, slope, of, alaska, the, r21, highway, to, murmansk, in, russia, and, many, roads, in, scandinavia, though, due, to, fjords, water, transport, is, sometimes, faster, large, areas, of, alaska, canada, greenland, and, siberia, are, sparsely, connected, for, example, all, 25, communities, of, nunavut, are, disconnected, from, each, other, and, the, main, north, american, road, network, road, transport, of, people, and, cargo, by, may, also, be, obstructed, by, border, controls, and, travel, restrictions, for, example, travel, from, other, parts, of, asia, to, south, korea, would, require, passage, through, the, hostile, country, of, north, korea, moving, between, most, countries, in, africa, and, eurasia, would, require, passing, through, egypt, and, israel, which, is, a, politically, sensitive, area, some, places, are, intentionally, car, free, and, roads, if, present, might, be, used, by, bicycles, or, pedestrians, roads, are, under, construction, to, many, remote, places, such, as, the, villages, of, the, annapurna, circuit, and, a, road, was, completed, in, 2013, to, m, dog, county, additional, intercontinental, and, transoceanic, fixed, links, have, been, proposed, including, a, bering, strait, crossing, that, would, connect, eurasia, africa, and, north, america, a, malacca, strait, bridge, to, the, largest, island, of, indonesia, from, asia, and, a, strait, of, gibraltar, crossing, to, connect, europe, and, africa, directly
