rubber, also, called, india, rubber, latex, amazonian, rubber, caucho, or, caoutchouc, as, initially, produced, consists, of, polymers, of, the, organic, compound, isoprene, with, minor, impurities, of, other, organic, compounds, thailand, malaysia, indonesia, and, cambodia, are, four, of, the, leading, rubber, producers, types, of, polyisoprene, that, are, used, as, natural, rubbers, are, classified, as, elastomers, currently, rubber, is, harvested, mainly, in, the, form, of, the, latex, from, the, par, rubber, tree, hevea, brasiliensis, or, others, the, latex, is, a, sticky, milky, and, white, colloid, drawn, off, by, making, incisions, in, the, bark, and, collecting, the, fluid, in, vessels, in, a, process, called, tapping, the, latex, then, is, refined, into, the, rubber, that, is, ready, for, commercial, processing, in, major, areas, latex, is, allowed, to, coagulate, in, the, collection, cup, the, coagulated, lumps, are, collected, and, processed, into, dry, forms, for, sale, natural, rubber, is, used, extensively, in, many, applications, and, products, either, alone, or, in, combination, with, other, materials, in, most, of, its, useful, forms, it, has, a, large, stretch, ratio, and, high, resilience, and, also, is, buoyant, and, water, proof, industrial, demand, for, rubber, like, materials, began, to, outstrip, natural, rubber, supplies, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, leading, to, the, synthesis, of, synthetic, rubber, in, 1909, by, chemical, means, the, major, commercial, source, of, natural, rubber, latex, is, the, amazonian, rubber, tree, hevea, brasiliensis, a, member, of, the, spurge, family, euphorbiaceae, once, native, to, brazil, the, species, is, now, pan, tropical, this, species, is, preferred, because, it, grows, well, under, cultivation, a, properly, managed, tree, responds, to, wounding, by, producing, more, latex, for, several, years, congo, rubber, formerly, a, major, source, of, rubber, which, motivated, the, atrocities, in, the, congo, free, state, came, from, vines, in, the, genus, landolphia, l, kirkii, l, heudelotis, and, l, owariensis, dandelion, milk, contains, latex, the, latex, exhibits, the, same, quality, as, the, natural, rubber, from, rubber, trees, in, the, wild, types, of, dandelion, latex, content, is, low, and, varies, greatly, in, nazi, germany, research, projects, tried, to, use, dandelions, as, a, base, for, rubber, production, but, failed, in, 2013, by, inhibiting, one, key, enzyme, and, using, modern, cultivation, methods, and, optimization, techniques, scientists, in, the, fraunhofer, institute, for, molecular, biology, and, applied, ecology, ime, in, germany, developed, a, cultivar, of, the, kazakh, dandelion, taraxacum, kok, saghyz, that, is, suitable, for, commercial, production, of, natural, rubber, in, collaboration, with, continental, tires, ime, began, a, pilot, facility, many, other, plants, produce, forms, of, latex, rich, in, isoprene, polymers, though, not, all, produce, usable, forms, of, polymer, as, easily, as, the, par, some, of, them, require, more, elaborate, processing, to, produce, anything, like, usable, rubber, and, most, are, more, difficult, to, tap, some, produce, other, desirable, materials, for, example, gutta, percha, palaquium, gutta, and, chicle, from, manilkara, species, others, that, have, been, commercially, exploited, or, at, least, showed, promise, as, rubber, sources, include, the, rubber, fig, ficus, elastica, panama, rubber, tree, castilla, elastica, various, spurges, euphorbia, spp, lettuce, lactuca, species, the, related, scorzonera, tau, saghyz, various, taraxacum, species, including, common, dandelion, taraxacum, officinale, and, kazakh, dandelion, and, perhaps, most, importantly, for, its, hypoallergenic, properties, guayule, parthenium, argentatum, the, term, gum, rubber, is, sometimes, applied, to, the, tree, obtained, version, of, natural, rubber, in, order, to, distinguish, it, from, the, synthetic, version, the, first, use, of, rubber, was, by, the, indigenous, cultures, of, mesoamerica, the, earliest, archeological, evidence, of, the, use, of, natural, latex, from, the, hevea, tree, comes, from, the, olmec, culture, in, which, rubber, was, first, used, for, making, balls, for, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, rubber, was, later, used, by, the, maya, and, aztec, cultures, in, addition, to, making, balls, aztecs, used, rubber, for, other, purposes, such, as, making, containers, and, to, make, textiles, waterproof, by, impregnating, them, with, the, latex, sap, charles, marie, de, la, condamine, is, credited, with, introducing, samples, of, rubber, to, the, acad, mie, royale, des, sciences, of, france, in, 1736, in, 1751, he, presented, a, paper, by, fran, ois, fresneau, to, the, acad, mie, published, in, 1755, that, described, many, of, rubber, s, properties, this, has, been, referred, to, as, the, first, scientific, paper, on, rubber, in, england, joseph, priestley, in, 1770, observed, that, a, piece, of, the, material, was, extremely, good, for, rubbing, off, pencil, marks, on, paper, hence, the, name, rubber, it, slowly, made, its, way, around, england, in, 1764, fran, ois, fresnau, discovered, that, turpentine, was, a, rubber, solvent, giovanni, fabbroni, is, credited, with, the, discovery, of, naphtha, as, a, rubber, solvent, in, 1779, charles, goodyear, redeveloped, vulcanization, in, 1839, although, mesoamericans, had, used, stabilized, rubber, for, balls, and, other, objects, as, early, as, 1600, bc, south, america, remained, the, main, source, of, latex, rubber, used, during, much, of, the, 19th, century, the, rubber, trade, was, heavily, controlled, by, business, interests, but, no, laws, expressly, prohibited, the, export, of, seeds, or, plants, in, 1876, henry, wickham, smuggled, 70, 000, amazonian, rubber, tree, seeds, from, brazil, and, delivered, them, to, kew, gardens, england, only, 2, 400, of, these, germinated, seedlings, were, then, sent, to, india, british, ceylon, sri, lanka, dutch, east, indies, indonesia, singapore, and, british, malaya, malaya, now, peninsular, malaysia, was, later, to, become, the, biggest, producer, of, rubber, in, the, early, 1900s, the, congo, free, state, in, africa, was, also, a, significant, source, of, natural, rubber, latex, mostly, gathered, by, forced, labor, king, leopold, ii, s, colonial, state, brutally, enforced, production, quotas, due, to, the, high, price, of, natural, rubber, at, the, time, tactics, to, enforce, the, rubber, quotas, included, removing, the, hands, of, victims, to, prove, they, had, been, killed, soldiers, often, came, back, from, raids, with, baskets, full, of, chopped, off, hands, villages, that, resisted, were, razed, to, encourage, better, compliance, locally, see, atrocities, in, the, congo, free, state, for, more, information, on, the, rubber, trade, in, the, congo, free, state, in, the, late, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, the, rubber, boom, in, the, amazon, also, similarly, affected, indigenous, populations, to, varying, degrees, correrias, or, slave, raids, were, frequent, in, colombia, peru, and, bolivia, where, many, were, either, captured, or, killed, the, most, well, known, case, of, atrocities, generated, from, rubber, extraction, in, south, america, came, from, the, putumayo, genocide, between, the, 1880s, 1913, julio, c, sar, arana, and, his, company, that, would, become, the, peruvian, amazon, company, controlled, the, putumayo, river, w, e, hardenburg, benjamin, salda, a, rocca, and, roger, casement, were, influential, figures, in, exposing, these, atrocities, roger, casement, was, also, prominent, in, revealing, the, congo, atrocities, to, the, world, days, before, entering, iquitos, by, boat, casement, wrote, caoutchouc, was, first, called, india, rubber, because, it, came, from, the, indies, and, the, earliest, european, use, of, it, was, to, rub, out, or, erase, it, is, now, called, india, rubber, because, it, rubs, out, or, erases, the, indians, in, india, commercial, cultivation, was, introduced, by, british, planters, although, the, experimental, efforts, to, grow, rubber, on, a, commercial, scale, were, initiated, as, early, as, 1873, at, the, calcutta, botanical, garden, the, first, commercial, hevea, plantations, were, established, at, thattekadu, in, kerala, in, 1902, in, later, years, the, plantation, expanded, to, karnataka, tamil, nadu, and, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, of, india, today, india, is, the, world, s, 3rd, largest, producer, and, 4th, largest, consumer, of, rubber, in, singapore, and, malaya, commercial, production, was, heavily, promoted, by, sir, henry, nicholas, ridley, who, served, as, the, first, scientific, director, of, the, singapore, botanic, gardens, from, 1888, to, 1911, he, distributed, rubber, seeds, to, many, planters, and, developed, the, first, technique, for, tapping, trees, for, latex, without, causing, serious, harm, to, the, tree, because, of, his, fervent, promotion, of, this, crop, he, is, popularly, remembered, by, the, nickname, mad, ridley, before, world, war, ii, significant, uses, included, door, and, window, profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, matting, flooring, and, dampeners, antivibration, mounts, for, the, automotive, industry, the, use, of, rubber, in, car, tires, initially, solid, rather, than, pneumatic, in, particular, consumed, a, significant, amount, of, rubber, gloves, medical, household, and, industrial, and, toy, balloons, were, large, consumers, of, rubber, although, the, type, of, rubber, used, is, concentrated, latex, significant, tonnage, of, rubber, was, used, as, adhesives, in, many, manufacturing, industries, and, products, although, the, two, most, noticeable, were, the, paper, and, the, carpet, industries, rubber, was, commonly, used, to, make, rubber, bands, and, pencil, erasers, rubber, produced, as, a, fiber, sometimes, called, elastic, had, significant, value, to, the, textile, industry, because, of, its, excellent, elongation, and, recovery, properties, for, these, purposes, manufactured, rubber, fiber, was, made, as, either, an, extruded, round, fiber, or, rectangular, fibers, cut, into, strips, from, extruded, film, because, of, its, low, dye, acceptance, feel, and, appearance, the, rubber, fiber, was, either, covered, by, yarn, of, another, fiber, or, directly, woven, with, other, yarns, into, the, fabric, rubber, yarns, were, used, in, foundation, garments, while, rubber, is, still, used, in, textile, manufacturing, its, low, tenacity, limits, its, use, in, lightweight, garments, because, latex, lacks, resistance, to, oxidizing, agents, and, is, damaged, by, aging, sunlight, oil, and, perspiration, the, textile, industry, turned, to, neoprene, polymer, of, chloroprene, a, type, of, synthetic, rubber, as, well, as, another, more, commonly, used, elastomer, fiber, spandex, also, known, as, elastane, because, of, their, superiority, to, rubber, in, both, strength, and, durability, rubber, exhibits, unique, physical, and, chemical, properties, rubber, s, stress, strain, behavior, exhibits, the, mullins, effect, and, the, payne, effect, and, is, often, modeled, as, hyperelastic, rubber, strain, crystallizes, because, there, are, weakened, allylic, c, h, bonds, in, each, repeat, unit, natural, rubber, is, susceptible, to, vulcanisation, as, well, as, being, sensitive, to, ozone, cracking, the, two, main, solvents, for, rubber, are, turpentine, and, naphtha, petroleum, because, rubber, does, not, dissolve, easily, the, material, is, finely, divided, by, shredding, prior, to, its, immersion, an, ammonia, solution, can, be, used, to, prevent, the, coagulation, of, raw, latex, rubber, begins, to, melt, at, approximately, 180, c, 356, f, on, a, microscopic, scale, relaxed, rubber, is, a, disorganized, cluster, of, erratically, changing, wrinkled, chains, in, stretched, rubber, the, chains, are, almost, linear, the, restoring, force, is, due, to, the, preponderance, of, wrinkled, conformations, over, more, linear, ones, for, the, quantitative, treatment, see, ideal, chain, for, more, examples, see, entropic, force, cooling, below, the, glass, transition, temperature, permits, local, conformational, changes, but, a, reordering, is, practically, impossible, because, of, the, larger, energy, barrier, for, the, concerted, movement, of, longer, chains, frozen, rubber, s, elasticity, is, low, and, strain, results, from, small, changes, of, bond, lengths, and, angles, this, caused, the, challenger, disaster, when, the, american, space, shuttle, s, flattened, o, rings, failed, to, relax, to, fill, a, widening, gap, the, glass, transition, is, fast, and, reversible, the, force, resumes, on, heating, the, parallel, chains, of, stretched, rubber, are, susceptible, to, crystallization, this, takes, some, time, because, turns, of, twisted, chains, have, to, move, out, of, the, way, of, the, growing, crystallites, crystallization, has, occurred, for, example, when, after, days, an, inflated, toy, balloon, is, found, withered, at, a, relatively, large, remaining, volume, where, it, is, touched, it, shrinks, because, the, temperature, of, the, hand, is, enough, to, melt, the, crystals, vulcanization, of, rubber, creates, di, and, polysulfide, bonds, between, chains, which, limits, the, degrees, of, freedom, and, results, in, chains, that, tighten, more, quickly, for, a, given, strain, thereby, increasing, the, elastic, force, constant, and, making, the, rubber, harder, and, less, extensible, raw, rubber, storage, depots, and, rubber, processing, can, produce, malodour, that, is, serious, enough, to, become, a, source, of, complaints, and, protest, to, those, living, in, the, vicinity, microbial, impurities, originate, during, the, processing, of, block, rubber, these, impurities, break, down, during, storage, or, thermal, degradation, and, produce, volatile, organic, compounds, examination, of, these, compounds, using, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gc, ms, and, gas, chromatography, gc, indicates, that, they, contain, sulfur, ammonia, alkenes, ketones, esters, hydrogen, sulfide, nitrogen, and, low, molecular, weight, fatty, acids, c2, c5, when, latex, concentrate, is, produced, from, rubber, sulfuric, acid, is, used, for, coagulation, this, produces, malodourous, hydrogen, sulfide, the, industry, can, mitigate, these, bad, odours, with, scrubber, systems, rubber, is, the, polymer, cis, 1, 4, polyisoprene, with, a, molecular, weight, of, 100, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, daltons, typically, a, small, percentage, up, to, 5, of, dry, mass, of, other, materials, such, as, proteins, fatty, acids, resins, and, inorganic, materials, salts, are, found, in, natural, rubber, polyisoprene, can, also, be, created, synthetically, producing, what, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, synthetic, natural, rubber, but, the, synthetic, and, natural, routes, are, distinct, some, natural, rubber, sources, such, as, gutta, percha, are, composed, of, trans, 1, 4, polyisoprene, a, structural, isomer, that, has, similar, properties, natural, rubber, is, an, elastomer, and, a, thermoplastic, once, the, rubber, is, vulcanized, it, is, a, thermoset, most, rubber, in, everyday, use, is, vulcanized, to, a, point, where, it, shares, properties, of, both, i, e, if, it, is, heated, and, cooled, it, is, degraded, but, not, destroyed, the, final, properties, of, a, rubber, item, depend, not, just, on, the, polymer, but, also, on, modifiers, and, fillers, such, as, carbon, black, factice, whiting, and, others, rubber, particles, are, formed, in, the, cytoplasm, of, specialized, latex, producing, cells, called, laticifers, within, rubber, plants, rubber, particles, are, surrounded, by, a, single, phospholipid, membrane, with, hydrophobic, tails, pointed, inward, the, membrane, allows, biosynthetic, proteins, to, be, sequestered, at, the, surface, of, the, growing, rubber, particle, which, allows, new, monomeric, units, to, be, added, from, outside, the, biomembrane, but, within, the, lacticifer, the, rubber, particle, is, an, enzymatically, active, entity, that, contains, three, layers, of, material, the, rubber, particle, a, biomembrane, and, free, monomeric, units, the, biomembrane, is, held, tightly, to, the, rubber, core, by, the, high, negative, charge, along, the, double, bonds, of, the, rubber, polymer, backbone, free, monomeric, units, and, conjugated, proteins, make, up, the, outer, layer, the, rubber, precursor, is, isopentenyl, pyrophosphate, an, allylic, compound, which, elongates, by, mg, 2, dependent, condensation, by, the, action, of, rubber, transferase, the, monomer, adds, to, the, pyrophosphate, end, of, the, growing, polymer, the, process, displaces, the, terminal, high, energy, pyrophosphate, the, reaction, produces, a, cis, polymer, the, initiation, step, is, catalyzed, by, prenyltransferase, which, converts, three, monomers, of, isopentenyl, pyrophosphate, into, farnesyl, pyrophosphate, the, farnesyl, pyrophosphate, can, bind, to, rubber, transferase, to, elongate, a, new, rubber, polymer, the, required, isopentenyl, pyrophosphate, is, obtained, from, the, mevalonate, pathway, which, derives, from, acetyl, coa, in, the, cytosol, in, plants, isoprene, pyrophosphate, can, also, be, obtained, from, the, 1, deox, d, xyulose, 5, phosphate, 2, c, methyl, d, erythritol, 4, phosphate, pathway, within, plasmids, the, relative, ratio, of, the, farnesyl, pyrophosphate, initiator, unit, and, isoprenyl, pyrophosphate, elongation, monomer, determines, the, rate, of, new, particle, synthesis, versus, elongation, of, existing, particles, though, rubber, is, known, to, be, produced, by, only, one, enzyme, extracts, of, latex, host, numerous, small, molecular, weight, proteins, with, unknown, function, the, proteins, possibly, serve, as, cofactors, as, the, synthetic, rate, decreases, with, complete, removal, more, than, 28, million, tons, of, rubber, were, produced, in, 2017, of, which, approximately, 47, was, natural, since, the, bulk, is, synthetic, which, is, derived, from, petroleum, the, price, of, natural, rubber, is, determined, to, a, large, extent, by, the, prevailing, global, price, of, crude, oil, asia, was, the, main, source, of, natural, rubber, accounting, for, about, 90, of, output, in, 2021, the, three, largest, producers, thailand, indonesia, and, malaysia, together, account, for, around, 72, of, all, natural, rubber, production, natural, rubber, is, not, cultivated, widely, in, its, native, continent, of, south, america, because, of, the, south, american, leaf, blight, and, other, natural, predators, there, rubber, latex, is, extracted, from, rubber, trees, the, economic, life, of, rubber, trees, in, plantations, is, around, 32, years, with, up, to, 7, years, being, an, immature, phase, and, about, 25, years, of, productive, phase, the, soil, requirement, is, well, drained, weathered, soil, consisting, of, laterite, lateritic, types, sedimentary, types, nonlateritic, red, or, alluvial, soils, the, climatic, conditions, for, optimum, growth, of, rubber, trees, are, many, high, yielding, clones, have, been, developed, for, commercial, planting, these, clones, yield, more, than, 2, 000, kilograms, per, hectare, 1, 800, lb, acre, of, dry, rubber, per, year, under, ideal, conditions, rubber, production, has, been, linked, to, deforestation, rubber, therefore, is, one, of, seven, commodities, included, in, the, 2023, eu, regulation, on, deforestation, free, products, eudr, which, aims, to, guarantee, that, the, products, european, union, eu, citizens, consume, do, not, contribute, to, deforestation, or, forest, degradation, worldwide, in, places, such, as, kerala, and, sri, lanka, where, coconuts, are, in, abundance, the, half, shell, of, coconut, was, used, as, the, latex, collection, container, glazed, pottery, or, aluminium, or, plastic, cups, became, more, common, in, kerala, india, and, other, countries, the, cups, are, supported, by, a, wire, that, encircles, the, tree, this, wire, incorporates, a, spring, so, it, can, stretch, as, the, tree, grows, the, latex, is, led, into, the, cup, by, a, galvanised, spout, knocked, into, the, bark, rubber, tapping, normally, takes, place, early, in, the, morning, when, the, internal, pressure, of, the, tree, is, highest, a, good, tapper, can, tap, a, tree, every, 20, seconds, on, a, standard, half, spiral, system, and, a, common, daily, task, size, is, between, 450, and, 650, trees, trees, are, usually, tapped, on, alternate, or, third, days, although, many, variations, in, timing, length, and, number, of, cuts, are, used, tappers, would, make, a, slash, in, the, bark, with, a, small, hatchet, these, slanting, cuts, allowed, latex, to, flow, from, ducts, located, on, the, exterior, or, the, inner, layer, of, bark, cambium, of, the, tree, since, the, cambium, controls, the, growth, of, the, tree, growth, stops, if, it, is, cut, thus, rubber, tapping, demanded, accuracy, so, that, the, incisions, would, not, be, too, many, given, the, size, of, the, tree, or, too, deep, which, could, stunt, its, growth, or, kill, it, it, is, usual, to, tap, a, panel, at, least, twice, sometimes, three, times, during, the, tree, s, life, the, economic, life, of, the, tree, depends, on, how, well, the, tapping, is, carried, out, as, the, critical, factor, is, bark, consumption, a, standard, in, malaysia, for, alternate, daily, tapping, is, 25, cm, vertical, bark, consumption, per, year, the, latex, containing, tubes, in, the, bark, ascend, in, a, spiral, to, the, right, for, this, reason, tapping, cuts, usually, ascend, to, the, left, to, cut, more, tubes, the, trees, drip, latex, for, about, four, hours, stopping, as, latex, coagulates, naturally, on, the, tapping, cut, thus, blocking, the, latex, tubes, in, the, bark, tappers, usually, rest, and, have, a, meal, after, finishing, their, tapping, work, and, then, start, collecting, the, liquid, field, latex, at, about, midday, the, four, types, of, field, coagula, are, cuplump, treelace, smallholders, lump, and, earth, scrap, each, has, significantly, different, properties, some, trees, continue, to, drip, after, the, collection, leading, to, a, small, amount, of, cup, lump, that, is, collected, at, the, next, tapping, the, latex, that, coagulates, on, the, cut, is, also, collected, as, tree, lace, tree, lace, and, cup, lump, together, account, for, 10, 20, of, the, dry, rubber, produced, latex, that, drips, onto, the, ground, earth, scrap, is, also, collected, periodically, for, processing, of, low, grade, product, cup, lump, is, the, coagulated, material, found, in, the, collection, cup, when, the, tapper, next, visits, the, tree, to, tap, it, again, it, arises, from, latex, clinging, to, the, walls, of, the, cup, after, the, latex, was, last, poured, into, the, bucket, and, from, late, dripping, latex, exuded, before, the, latex, carrying, vessels, of, the, tree, become, blocked, it, is, of, higher, purity, and, of, greater, value, than, the, other, three, types, cup, lumps, can, also, be, used, to, describe, a, completely, different, type, of, coagulate, that, has, collected, in, smallholder, plantations, over, a, period, of, 1, 2, weeks, after, tapping, all, of, the, trees, the, tapper, will, return, to, each, tree, and, stir, in, some, type, of, acid, which, allows, the, newly, harvested, latex, to, mix, with, the, previously, coagulated, material, the, rubber, acid, mixture, is, what, gives, rubber, plantations, markets, and, factories, a, strong, odor, tree, lace, is, the, coagulum, strip, that, the, tapper, peels, off, the, previous, cut, before, making, a, new, cut, it, usually, has, higher, copper, and, manganese, contents, than, cup, lump, both, copper, and, manganese, are, pro, oxidants, and, can, damage, the, physical, properties, of, the, dry, rubber, smallholders, lump, is, produced, by, smallholders, who, collect, rubber, from, trees, far, from, the, nearest, factory, many, indonesian, smallholders, who, farm, paddies, in, remote, areas, tap, dispersed, trees, on, their, way, to, work, in, the, paddy, fields, and, collect, the, latex, or, the, coagulated, latex, on, their, way, home, as, it, is, often, impossible, to, preserve, the, latex, sufficiently, to, get, it, to, a, factory, that, processes, latex, in, time, for, it, to, be, used, to, make, high, quality, products, and, as, the, latex, would, anyway, have, coagulated, by, the, time, it, reached, the, factory, the, smallholder, will, coagulate, it, by, any, means, available, in, any, container, available, some, smallholders, use, small, containers, buckets, etc, but, often, the, latex, is, coagulated, in, holes, in, the, ground, which, are, usually, lined, with, plastic, sheeting, acidic, materials, and, fermented, fruit, juices, are, used, to, coagulate, the, latex, a, form, of, assisted, biological, coagulation, little, care, is, taken, to, exclude, twigs, leaves, and, even, bark, from, the, lumps, that, are, formed, which, may, also, include, tree, lace, earth, scrap, is, material, that, gathers, around, the, base, of, the, tree, it, arises, from, latex, overflowing, from, the, cut, and, running, down, the, bark, from, rain, flooding, a, collection, cup, containing, latex, and, from, spillage, from, tappers, buckets, during, collection, it, contains, soil, and, other, contaminants, and, has, variable, rubber, content, depending, on, the, amount, of, contaminants, earth, scrap, is, collected, by, field, workers, two, or, three, times, a, year, and, may, be, cleaned, in, a, scrap, washer, to, recover, the, rubber, or, sold, to, a, contractor, who, cleans, it, and, recovers, the, rubber, it, is, of, low, quality, latex, coagulates, in, the, cups, if, kept, for, long, and, must, be, collected, before, this, happens, the, collected, latex, field, latex, is, transferred, into, coagulation, tanks, for, the, preparation, of, dry, rubber, or, transferred, into, air, tight, containers, with, sieving, for, ammoniation, ammoniation, invented, by, patent, lawyer, and, vice, president, of, the, united, states, rubber, company, ernest, hopkinson, around, 1920, preserves, the, latex, in, a, colloidal, state, for, longer, periods, of, time, latex, is, generally, processed, into, either, latex, concentrate, for, manufacture, of, dipped, goods, or, coagulated, under, controlled, clean, conditions, using, formic, acid, the, coagulated, latex, can, then, be, processed, into, the, higher, grade, technically, specified, block, rubbers, such, as, svr, 3l, or, svr, cv, or, used, to, produce, ribbed, smoke, sheet, grades, naturally, coagulated, rubber, cup, lump, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, tsr10, and, tsr20, grade, rubbers, processing, for, these, grades, is, a, size, reduction, and, cleaning, process, to, remove, contamination, and, prepare, the, material, for, the, final, stage, of, drying, the, dried, material, is, then, baled, and, palletized, for, storage, and, shipment, rubber, is, a, natural, polymer, of, isoprene, polyisoprene, and, an, elastomer, a, stretchy, polymer, polymers, are, simply, chains, of, molecules, that, can, be, linked, together, rubber, is, one, of, the, few, naturally, occurring, polymers, and, prized, for, its, high, stretch, ratio, resilience, and, water, proof, properties, other, examples, of, natural, polymers, include, tortoise, shell, amber, and, animal, horn, when, harvested, latex, rubber, takes, the, form, of, latex, an, opaque, white, milky, suspension, of, rubber, particles, in, water, it, is, then, transformed, through, industrial, processes, to, the, solid, form, widely, seen, in, manufactured, goods, natural, rubber, is, reactive, and, vulnerable, to, oxidization, but, it, can, be, stabilized, through, a, heating, process, called, vulcanization, vulcanization, is, a, process, by, which, the, rubber, is, heated, and, sulfur, peroxide, or, bisphenol, are, added, to, improve, resistance, and, elasticity, and, to, prevent, it, from, oxidizing, carbon, black, which, can, be, derived, from, a, petroleum, refinery, or, other, natural, incineration, processes, is, sometimes, used, as, an, additive, to, rubber, to, improve, its, strength, especially, in, vehicle, tires, during, vulcanization, rubber, s, polyisoprene, molecules, long, chains, of, isoprene, are, heated, and, cross, linked, with, molecular, bonds, to, sulfur, forming, a, 3, d, matrix, the, optimal, percentage, of, sulfur, is, approximately, 10, in, this, form, the, polyisoprene, molecules, orientation, is, still, random, but, they, become, aligned, when, the, rubber, is, stretched, this, sulfur, vulcanization, makes, the, rubber, stronger, and, more, rigid, but, still, very, elastic, and, through, the, vulcanization, process, the, sulfur, and, latex, are, meant, to, be, totally, used, up, in, individual, form, natural, rubber, latex, is, shipped, from, factories, in, southeast, asia, south, america, and, west, and, central, africa, to, destinations, around, the, world, as, the, cost, of, natural, rubber, has, risen, significantly, and, rubber, products, are, dense, the, shipping, methods, offering, the, lowest, cost, per, unit, weight, are, preferred, depending, on, destination, warehouse, availability, and, transportation, conditions, some, methods, are, preferred, by, certain, buyers, in, international, trade, latex, rubber, is, mostly, shipped, in, 20, foot, ocean, containers, inside, the, container, smaller, containers, are, used, to, store, the, latex, there, is, growing, concern, for, the, future, supply, of, rubber, due, to, various, factors, including, plant, disease, climate, change, and, the, volatile, market, price, of, rubber, producers, of, natural, rubber, are, mostly, small, family, held, plantations, often, serving, large, industrial, aggregators, high, volatility, in, the, price, of, rubber, affects, rubber, plantation, investment, and, farmers, may, remove, their, rubber, trees, if, the, international, market, spot, price, of, a, seemingly, more, profitable, crop, for, example, palm, oil, surges, in, relation, to, rubber, for, instance, during, the, 2020, and, 2021, international, covid, 19, pandemic, demand, for, rubber, gloves, surged, leading, to, a, spike, in, rubber, prices, of, about, 30, in, addition, to, the, pandemic, demand, exceeded, supply, in, part, because, long, term, plantations, had, been, torn, out, and, replaced, with, other, crops, over, the, previous, 5, 10, years, and, other, areas, were, affected, by, climate, fueled, natural, disasters, in, this, environment, producers, did, increase, their, prices, in, keeping, with, supply, and, demand, dynamics, putting, upward, price, pressure, on, the, whole, downstream, supply, chain, uncured, rubber, is, used, for, cements, for, adhesive, insulating, and, friction, tapes, and, for, crepe, rubber, used, in, insulating, blankets, and, footwear, vulcanized, rubber, has, many, more, applications, resistance, to, abrasion, makes, softer, kinds, of, rubber, valuable, for, the, treads, of, vehicle, tires, and, conveyor, belts, and, makes, hard, rubber, valuable, for, pump, housings, and, piping, used, in, the, handling, of, abrasive, sludge, the, flexibility, of, rubber, is, appealing, in, hoses, tires, and, rollers, for, devices, ranging, from, domestic, clothes, wringers, to, printing, presses, its, elasticity, makes, it, suitable, for, various, kinds, of, shock, absorbers, and, for, specialized, machinery, mountings, designed, to, reduce, vibration, its, relative, gas, impermeability, makes, it, useful, in, the, manufacture, of, articles, such, as, air, hoses, balloons, balls, and, cushions, the, resistance, of, rubber, to, water, and, to, the, action, of, most, fluid, chemicals, has, led, to, its, use, in, rainwear, diving, gear, and, chemical, and, medicinal, tubing, and, as, a, lining, for, storage, tanks, processing, equipment, and, railroad, tank, cars, because, of, their, electrical, resistance, soft, rubber, goods, are, used, as, insulation, and, for, protective, gloves, shoes, and, blankets, hard, rubber, is, used, for, articles, such, as, telephone, housings, and, parts, for, radio, sets, meters, and, other, electrical, instruments, the, coefficient, of, friction, of, rubber, which, is, high, on, dry, surfaces, and, low, on, wet, surfaces, leads, to, its, use, for, power, transmission, belting, highly, flexible, couplings, and, for, water, lubricated, bearings, in, deep, well, pumps, indian, rubber, balls, or, lacrosse, balls, are, made, of, rubber, around, 25, million, tonnes, of, rubber, are, produced, each, year, of, which, 30, percent, is, natural, the, remainder, is, synthetic, rubber, derived, from, petrochemical, sources, the, top, end, of, latex, production, results, in, latex, products, such, as, surgeons, gloves, balloons, and, other, relatively, high, value, products, the, mid, range, which, comes, from, the, technically, specified, natural, rubber, materials, ends, up, largely, in, tires, but, also, in, conveyor, belts, marine, products, windshield, wipers, and, miscellaneous, goods, natural, rubber, offers, good, elasticity, while, synthetic, materials, tend, to, offer, better, resistance, to, environmental, factors, such, as, oils, temperature, chemicals, and, ultraviolet, light, cured, rubber, is, rubber, that, has, been, compounded, and, subjected, to, the, vulcanisation, process, to, create, cross, links, within, the, rubber, matrix, rubber, can, be, added, to, cement, to, improve, its, properties, some, people, have, a, serious, latex, allergy, and, exposure, to, natural, latex, rubber, products, such, as, latex, gloves, can, cause, anaphylactic, shock, the, antigenic, proteins, found, in, hevea, latex, are, greatly, reduced, by, about, 99, 9, percent, though, not, eliminated, through, vulcanization, processing, latex, from, non, hevea, sources, such, as, guayule, can, be, used, without, allergic, reaction, by, persons, with, an, allergy, to, hevea, latex, some, allergic, reactions, are, not, to, the, latex, itself, but, from, residues, of, chemicals, used, to, accelerate, the, cross, linking, process, although, this, may, be, confused, with, an, allergy, to, latex, it, is, distinct, from, it, typically, taking, the, form, of, type, iv, hypersensitivity, in, the, presence, of, traces, of, specific, processing, chemicals, natural, rubber, is, susceptible, to, degradation, by, a, wide, range, of, bacteria, the, bacteria, streptomyces, coelicolor, pseudomonas, citronellolis, and, nocardia, spp, are, capable, of, degrading, vulcanized,
