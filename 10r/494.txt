a, bulletproof, vest, also, known, as, a, ballistic, vest, or, a, bullet, resistant, vest, is, an, item, of, body, armour, that, helps, absorb, the, impact, and, reduce, or, stop, penetration, to, the, torso, by, firearm, fired, projectiles, and, fragmentation, from, explosions, the, vest, may, come, in, a, soft, form, as, worn, by, many, police, officers, prison, officers, security, guards, and, some, private, citizens, used, to, protect, against, stabbing, attacks, or, light, projectiles, or, hard, form, using, metallic, or, para, aramid, components, soldiers, and, police, tactical, units, wear, hard, armour, either, in, conjunction, with, soft, armour, or, alone, to, protect, against, rifle, ammunition, or, fragmentation, in, 1538, duke, francesco, maria, della, rovere, a, condottiero, commissioned, filippo, negroli, to, create, a, bulletproof, vest, in, 1561, maximilian, ii, holy, roman, emperor, is, recorded, as, testing, his, armour, against, gun, fire, similarly, in, 1590, henry, lee, of, ditchley, expected, his, greenwich, armour, to, be, pistol, proof, its, actual, effectiveness, was, controversial, at, the, time, during, the, english, civil, war, oliver, cromwell, s, ironside, cavalry, were, equipped, with, lobster, tailed, pot, helmet, and, musket, proof, cuirasses, which, consisted, of, two, layers, of, armour, plating, the, outer, layer, was, designed, to, absorb, the, bullet, s, energy, and, the, thicker, inner, layer, stopped, further, penetration, the, armour, would, be, left, badly, dented, but, still, serviceable, one, of, the, first, examples, of, commercially, sold, bulletproof, armour, was, produced, by, a, tailor, in, dublin, in, the, 1840s, the, cork, examiner, reported, on, his, line, of, business, in, december, 1847, another, soft, ballistic, vest, myeonje, baegab, was, invented, in, joseon, korea, in, the, 1860s, shortly, after, the, punitive, 1866, french, expedition, to, korea, the, regent, of, joseon, ordered, the, development, of, bulletproof, armour, because, of, increasing, threats, from, western, armies, kim, gidu, and, gang, yun, found, that, cotton, could, protect, against, bullets, if, 10, layers, of, cotton, fabric, were, used, the, vests, were, used, in, battle, during, the, united, states, expedition, to, korea, when, the, us, navy, attacked, ganghwa, island, in, 1871, the, us, navy, captured, one, of, the, vests, and, took, it, to, the, us, where, it, was, stored, at, the, smithsonian, museum, until, 2007, the, vest, has, since, been, sent, back, to, korea, and, is, currently, on, display, to, the, public, simple, ballistic, armor, was, sometimes, constructed, by, criminals, during, the, 1880s, a, gang, of, australian, bushrangers, led, by, ned, kelly, made, basic, armour, each, of, the, four, kelly, gang, members, had, fought, a, siege, at, a, hotel, clad, in, suits, of, armour, made, from, the, mouldboards, of, ploughs, the, maker, s, stamp, lennon, number, 2, type, was, found, inside, several, of, the, plates, the, armour, covered, the, men, s, torsos, upper, arms, and, upper, legs, and, was, worn, with, a, helmet, the, suits, were, roughly, made, on, a, creek, bed, using, a, makeshift, forge, and, a, stringy, bark, log, as, a, muffled, anvil, the, suits, had, a, mass, of, around, 44, kilograms, 97, lb, but, eventually, were, of, no, use, as, the, suits, lacked, protection, for, the, legs, and, hands, american, outlaw, and, gunfighter, jim, miller, was, infamous, for, wearing, a, steel, breastplate, under, his, frock, coat, as, a, form, of, body, armor, this, plate, saved, miller, on, two, occasions, and, it, proved, to, be, highly, resistant, to, pistol, bullets, and, shotguns, one, example, can, be, seen, in, his, gun, battle, with, a, sheriff, named, george, a, bud, frazer, where, the, plate, managed, to, deflect, all, bullets, from, the, lawman, s, revolver, in, 1881, the, tombstone, arizona, physician, george, e, goodfellow, noticed, that, charlie, storms, who, was, shot, twice, by, faro, dealer, luke, short, had, one, bullet, stopped, by, a, silk, handkerchief, in, his, breast, pocket, that, prevented, that, bullet, from, penetrating, in, 1887, he, wrote, an, article, titled, impenetrability, of, silk, to, bullets, for, the, southern, california, practitioner, documenting, the, first, known, instance, of, bulletproof, fabric, he, experimented, with, silk, vests, resembling, gambesons, that, used, 18, to, 30, layers, of, silk, to, protect, the, wearers, from, penetration, kazimierz, egle, used, goodfellow, s, findings, to, develop, a, silk, bulletproof, vest, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, which, could, stop, the, relatively, slow, rounds, from, black, powder, handguns, the, vests, cost, us, 800, each, in, 1914, equivalent, to, 24, 000, in, 2023, a, similar, vest, made, by, polish, inventor, jan, szczepanik, in, 1901, saved, the, life, of, alfonso, xiii, of, spain, when, he, was, shot, by, an, attacker, by, 1900, us, gangsters, were, wearing, 800, silk, vests, to, protect, themselves, the, combatants, of, world, war, i, started, the, war, without, any, attempt, at, providing, the, soldiers, with, body, armor, various, private, companies, advertised, body, protection, suits, such, as, the, birmingham, chemico, body, shield, although, these, products, were, generally, far, too, expensive, for, an, average, soldier, the, first, official, attempts, at, commissioning, body, armor, were, made, in, 1915, by, the, british, army, design, committee, trench, warfare, section, in, particular, a, bomber, s, shield, bomber, being, the, term, for, those, who, threw, grenades, rather, than, grenadier, the, experimental, ordnance, board, also, reviewed, potential, materials, for, bullet, and, fragment, proof, armor, such, as, steel, plate, a, necklet, was, successfully, issued, on, a, small, scale, due, to, cost, considerations, which, protected, the, neck, and, shoulders, from, bullets, traveling, at, 600, ft, s, 180, m, s, with, interwoven, layers, of, silk, and, cotton, stiffened, with, resin, the, dayfield, body, shield, entered, service, in, 1916, and, a, hardened, breastplate, was, introduced, the, following, year, the, british, army, medical, services, calculated, towards, the, end, of, the, war, that, three, quarters, of, all, battle, injuries, could, have, been, prevented, if, an, effective, armor, had, been, issued, the, french, experimented, with, steel, visors, attached, to, the, adrian, helmet, and, abdominal, armor, designed, by, general, adrian, in, addition, to, shoulder, epaulets, to, protect, from, falling, debris, and, darts, these, failed, to, be, practical, because, they, severely, impeded, the, soldier, s, mobility, the, germans, officially, issued, body, armor, in, the, form, of, nickel, and, silicon, armor, plates, that, was, called, sappenpanzer, nicknamed, lobster, armor, from, late, 1916, these, were, similarly, too, heavy, to, be, practical, for, the, rank, and, file, but, were, used, by, static, units, such, as, sentries, and, occasionally, machine, gunners, an, improved, version, the, infanterie, panzer, was, introduced, in, 1918, with, hooks, for, equipment, the, united, states, developed, several, types, of, body, armor, including, the, chrome, nickel, steel, brewster, body, shield, which, consisted, of, a, breastplate, and, a, headpiece, and, could, withstand, lewis, gun, bullets, at, 2, 700, ft, s, 820, m, s, but, was, clumsy, and, heavy, at, 40, lb, 18, kg, a, scaled, waistcoat, of, overlapping, steel, scales, fixed, to, a, leather, lining, was, also, designed, this, armor, weighed, 11, lb, 5, 0, kg, fit, close, to, the, body, and, was, considered, more, comfortable, during, the, late, 1920s, through, the, early, 1930s, gunmen, from, criminal, gangs, in, the, united, states, began, wearing, less, expensive, vests, made, from, thick, layers, of, cotton, padding, and, cloth, these, early, vests, could, absorb, the, impact, of, handgun, rounds, such, as, 22, long, rifle, 25, acp, 32, s, w, long, 32, s, w, 380, acp, 38, special, and, 45, acp, traveling, at, speeds, of, up, to, 300, m, s, 980, ft, s, to, overcome, these, vests, law, enforcement, agents, began, using, the, newer, and, more, powerful, 38, super, and, later, the, 357, magnum, cartridge, in, 1940, the, medical, research, council, in, britain, proposed, the, use, of, a, lightweight, suit, of, armour, for, general, use, by, infantry, and, a, heavier, suit, for, troops, in, more, dangerous, positions, such, as, anti, aircraft, and, naval, gun, crews, by, february, 1941, trials, had, begun, on, body, armour, made, of, mangalloy, plates, two, plates, covered, the, front, area, and, one, plate, on, the, lower, back, protected, the, kidneys, and, other, vital, organs, five, thousand, sets, were, made, and, evaluated, to, almost, unanimous, approval, as, well, as, providing, adequate, protection, the, armour, didn, t, severely, impede, the, mobility, of, the, soldier, and, were, reasonably, comfortable, to, wear, the, armor, was, introduced, in, 1942, although, the, demand, for, it, was, later, scaled, down, in, northwestern, europe, the, 2nd, canadian, division, during, world, war, ii, also, adopted, this, armour, for, medical, personnel, the, british, company, wilkinson, sword, began, to, produce, flak, jackets, for, bomber, crews, in, 1943, under, contract, with, the, royal, air, force, the, majority, of, pilot, deaths, in, the, air, were, due, to, low, velocity, fragments, rather, than, bullets, the, surgeon, general, of, the, united, states, air, force, colonel, m, c, grow, who, was, stationed, in, britain, thought, that, many, wounds, he, was, treating, could, have, been, prevented, by, some, kind, of, light, armor, two, types, of, armor, were, issued, for, different, specifications, these, jackets, were, made, of, nylon, and, capable, of, stopping, flak, and, fragmentation, but, were, not, designed, to, stop, bullets, although, they, were, considered, too, bulky, for, pilots, using, the, avro, lancaster, they, were, adopted, by, the, united, states, army, air, forces, in, the, early, stages, of, world, war, ii, the, united, states, also, designed, body, armor, for, infantrymen, but, most, models, were, too, heavy, and, mobility, restricting, to, be, useful, in, the, field, and, incompatible, with, existing, required, equipment, near, the, middle, of, 1944, development, of, infantry, body, armor, in, the, united, states, restarted, several, vests, were, produced, for, the, us, military, including, but, not, limited, to, the, t34, the, t39, the, t62e1, and, the, m12, the, united, states, developed, a, vest, using, doron, plate, a, fiberglass, based, fibre, reinforced, plastic, these, vests, were, first, used, in, the, battle, of, okinawa, in, 1945, the, soviet, armed, forces, used, several, types, of, body, armour, including, the, sn, 42, from, stalnoi, nagrudnik, russian, for, steel, breastplate, and, the, number, denotes, the, design, year, all, were, tested, but, only, the, sn, 42, was, put, in, production, it, consisted, of, two, pressed, steel, plates, that, protected, the, front, torso, and, groin, the, plates, were, 2, mm, thick, and, weighed, 3, 5, kg, 7, 7, lb, this, armour, was, generally, supplied, to, assault, engineers, shisbr, and, tank, desantniki, the, sn, armour, protected, wearers, from, 9, 19mm, bullets, fired, by, an, mp, 40, submachine, gun, at, around, 100, m, 110, yd, and, sometimes, it, was, able, to, deflect, 7, 92, mauser, rifle, bullets, and, bayonet, blades, but, only, at, very, low, angle, this, made, it, useful, in, urban, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, stalingrad, however, the, sn, s, weight, made, it, impractical, for, infantry, in, the, open, some, apocryphal, accounts, note, point, blank, deflection, of, 9mm, bullets, and, testing, of, similar, armour, supports, this, theory, during, the, korean, war, several, new, vests, were, produced, for, the, united, states, military, including, the, m, 1951, which, made, use, of, fibre, reinforced, plastic, or, aluminium, segments, woven, into, a, nylon, vest, these, vests, represented, a, vast, improvement, on, weight, but, the, armor, failed, to, stop, bullets, and, fragments, very, successfully, although, officially, they, were, claimed, to, be, able, to, stop, 7, 62, 25mm, tokarev, pistol, rounds, at, the, muzzle, such, vests, equipped, with, doron, plate, have, in, informal, testing, defeated, 45, acp, handgun, ammunition, developed, by, natick, laboratories, now, the, combat, capabilities, development, command, soldier, center, and, introduced, in, 1967, t65, 2, plate, carriers, were, the, first, vests, designed, to, hold, hard, ceramic, plates, making, them, capable, of, stopping, 7, mm, rifle, rounds, these, chicken, plates, were, made, of, either, boron, carbide, silicon, carbide, or, aluminium, oxide, they, were, issued, to, the, crew, of, low, flying, aircraft, such, as, the, uh, 1, and, uc, 123, during, the, vietnam, war, conscious, of, us, developments, during, the, korean, war, the, soviet, union, also, began, the, development, of, body, armour, for, its, troops, resulting, in, the, adoption, of, the, 6b1, vest, in, 1957, this, marked, a, shift, away, from, previous, systems, like, the, sn, 42, which, relied, on, large, monolithic, plates, that, were, inflexible, and, substantially, affected, a, soldier, s, balance, the, 6b1, and, all, subsequent, soviet, body, armour, would, rely, upon, ballistic, fabric, wrapped, plates, initially, steel, and, later, titanium, and, boron, carbide, between, 1957, and, 1958, anywhere, between, 1500, and, 5000, 6b1, vests, were, produced, but, they, were, subsequently, put, in, storage, and, not, issued, until, the, early, years, of, the, soviet, afghan, war, where, they, were, used, in, limited, quantities, and, were, able, to, resist, shrapnel, and, tokarev, rounds, in, 1969, american, body, armor, was, founded, and, began, to, produce, a, patented, combination, of, quilted, nylon, faced, with, multiple, steel, plates, this, armor, configuration, was, marketed, to, american, law, enforcement, agencies, by, smith, wesson, under, the, trade, name, barrier, vest, the, barrier, vest, was, the, first, police, vest, to, gain, wide, use, during, high, threat, police, operations, in, 1971, research, chemist, stephanie, kwolek, discovered, a, liquid, crystalline, polymer, solution, its, exceptional, strength, and, stiffness, led, to, the, invention, of, kevlar, a, synthetic, fibre, woven, into, a, fabric, and, layered, that, by, weight, has, five, times, the, tensile, strength, of, steel, in, the, mid, 1970s, dupont, the, company, which, employed, kwolek, introduced, kevlar, immediately, kevlar, was, incorporated, into, a, national, institute, of, justice, nij, evaluation, program, to, provide, lightweight, able, body, armour, to, a, test, pool, of, american, law, enforcement, officers, to, ascertain, if, everyday, able, wearing, was, possible, lester, shubin, a, program, manager, at, the, nij, managed, this, law, enforcement, feasibility, study, within, a, few, selected, large, police, agencies, and, quickly, determined, that, kevlar, body, armor, could, be, comfortably, worn, by, police, daily, and, would, save, lives, in, 1975, richard, a, armellino, the, founder, of, american, body, armor, marketed, an, all, kevlar, vest, called, the, k, 15, consisting, of, 15, layers, of, kevlar, that, also, included, a, 5, 8, ballistic, steel, shok, plate, positioned, vertically, over, the, heart, and, was, issued, us, patent, 3, 971, 072, for, this, innovation, similarly, sized, and, positioned, trauma, plates, are, still, used, today, on, most, vests, reducing, blunt, trauma, and, increasing, ballistic, protection, in, the, center, mass, heart, sternum, area, in, 1976, richard, davis, founder, of, second, chance, body, armor, designed, the, company, s, first, all, kevlar, vest, the, model, y, the, lightweight, able, vest, industry, was, launched, and, a, new, form, of, daily, protection, for, the, modern, police, officer, was, quickly, adopted, by, the, mid, to, late, 1980s, an, estimated, 1, 3, to, 1, 2, of, police, patrol, officers, wore, able, vests, daily, by, 2006, more, than, 2, 000, documented, police, vest, saves, were, recorded, validating, the, success, and, efficiency, of, lightweight, able, body, armor, as, a, standard, piece, of, everyday, police, equipment, during, the, 1980s, the, us, military, issued, the, pasgt, kevlar, vest, tested, privately, at, nij, level, iia, by, several, sources, able, to, stop, pistol, rounds, including, 9, mm, fmj, but, intended, and, approved, only, for, fragmentation, west, germany, issued, a, similar, rated, vest, called, the, splitterschutzweste, during, the, early, 1980s, body, armor, vests, began, to, see, widespread, use, by, several, countries, in, addition, to, more, prolific, users, like, the, us, and, uk, following, the, 1982, israeli, intervention, during, the, lebanese, civil, war, body, armor, was, widely, issued, to, israeli, troops, as, well, as, european, peacekeepers, and, to, a, lesser, degree, by, syrian, troops, during, the, soviet, afghan, war, the, obsolete, 6b1, was, rapidly, replaced, by, the, 6b2, which, was, issued, from, 1980, onward, and, by, 1983, was, issued, to, the, vast, majority, of, the, 40th, army, kevlar, soft, armor, had, its, shortcomings, because, if, large, fragments, or, high, velocity, bullets, hit, the, vest, the, energy, could, cause, life, threatening, blunt, trauma, injuries, in, selected, vital, areas, ranger, body, armor, was, developed, for, the, american, military, in, 1991, although, it, was, the, second, modern, us, body, armor, that, was, able, to, stop, rifle, caliber, rounds, and, still, be, light, enough, to, be, worn, by, infantry, soldiers, in, the, field, first, being, the, isapo, or, interim, small, arms, protective, overvest, it, still, had, its, flaws, it, was, still, heavier, than, the, concurrently, issued, pasgt, personal, armor, system, for, ground, troops, anti, fragmentation, armor, worn, by, regular, infantry, and, did, not, have, the, same, degree, of, ballistic, protection, around, the, neck, and, shoulders, the, format, of, ranger, body, armor, and, more, recent, body, armor, issued, to, us, special, operations, units, highlights, the, trade, offs, between, force, protection, and, mobility, that, modern, body, armor, forces, organizations, to, address, newer, armor, issued, by, the, united, states, armed, forces, to, large, numbers, of, troops, includes, the, united, states, army, s, improved, outer, tactical, vest, and, the, united, states, marine, corps, modular, tactical, vest, all, of, these, systems, are, designed, with, the, vest, intended, to, provide, protection, from, fragments, and, pistol, rounds, hard, ceramic, plates, such, as, the, small, arms, protective, insert, as, used, with, interceptor, body, armor, are, worn, to, protect, the, vital, organs, from, higher, level, threats, these, threats, mostly, take, the, form, of, high, velocity, and, armor, piercing, rifle, rounds, similar, types, of, protective, equipment, have, been, adopted, by, modern, armed, forces, over, the, world, since, the, 1970s, several, new, fibers, and, construction, methods, for, bulletproof, fabric, have, been, developed, besides, woven, kevlar, such, as, dsm, s, dyneema, honeywell, s, gold, flex, and, spectra, teijin, aramid, s, twaron, pinnacle, armor, s, dragon, skin, and, toyobo, s, zylon, the, us, military, has, developed, body, armor, for, the, working, dogs, who, aid, soldiers, in, battle, due, to, the, various, types, of, projectile, it, is, often, inaccurate, to, refer, to, a, particular, product, as, bulletproof, because, this, implies, that, it, will, protect, against, any, and, all, threats, instead, the, term, bullet, resistant, is, generally, preferred, vest, specifications, will, typically, include, both, penetration, resistance, requirements, and, limits, on, the, amount, of, impact, force, that, is, delivered, to, the, body, even, without, penetration, heavy, bullets, can, deal, enough, force, to, cause, blunt, force, trauma, under, the, impact, point, on, the, other, hand, some, bullets, can, penetrate, the, vest, but, deal, low, damage, to, its, wearer, due, to, the, loss, of, speed, or, small, reduced, mass, form, armour, piercing, ammunition, tends, to, have, poor, terminal, ballistics, due, to, it, being, specifically, not, intended, to, fragment, or, expand, body, armor, standards, are, regional, around, the, world, ammunition, varies, and, as, a, result, the, armor, testing, must, reflect, the, threats, found, locally, law, enforcement, statistics, show, that, many, shootings, where, officers, are, injured, or, killed, involve, the, officer, s, own, weapon, as, a, result, each, law, enforcement, agency, or, para, military, organization, will, have, their, own, standard, for, armor, performance, if, only, to, ensure, that, their, armor, protects, them, from, their, own, weapons, while, many, standards, exist, a, few, standards, are, widely, used, as, models, the, us, national, institute, of, justice, ballistic, and, stab, documents, are, examples, of, broadly, accepted, standards, in, addition, to, the, nij, the, uk, home, office, scientific, development, branch, hosdb, formerly, the, police, scientific, development, branch, psdb, and, vpam, german, acronym, for, the, association, of, laboratories, for, bullet, resistant, materials, and, constructions, originally, from, germany, are, other, widely, accepted, standards, in, the, russian, area, the, gost, standard, is, dominant, modern, body, armor, is, generally, split, into, one, of, two, categories, soft, armor, and, hard, armor, soft, armor, is, typically, made, of, woven, fabrics, like, dyneema, or, kevlar, and, usually, provides, protection, against, fragmentation, and, handgun, threats, hard, armor, usually, refers, to, ballistic, plates, these, hardened, plates, are, designed, to, defend, against, rifle, threats, in, addition, to, the, threats, covered, by, soft, armor, soft, armour, is, usually, made, of, woven, fabrics, synthetic, or, natural, and, protects, up, to, nij, level, iiia, soft, armour, can, be, worn, stand, alone, or, can, be, combined, with, hard, armor, as, part, of, an, in, conjunction, armor, system, in, these, in, conjunction, systems, a, soft, armor, plate, backer, is, usually, placed, behind, the, ballistic, plate, and, the, combination, of, soft, and, hard, armor, provides, the, designated, level, of, protection, broadly, there, are, three, basic, types, of, hard, armor, ballistic, plates, ceramic, plate, based, systems, steel, plate, with, spall, fragmentation, protective, coating, or, backer, and, hard, fiber, based, laminate, systems, these, hard, armor, plates, may, be, designed, to, be, used, stand, alone, or, in, conjunction, with, soft, armor, backers, also, called, plate, backers, many, systems, contain, both, hard, ceramic, components, and, laminated, textile, materials, used, together, various, ceramic, materials, types, are, in, use, however, aluminum, oxide, boron, carbide, and, silicon, carbide, are, the, most, common, the, fibers, used, in, these, systems, are, the, same, as, found, in, soft, textile, armor, however, for, rifle, protection, high, pressure, lamination, of, ultra, high, molecular, weight, polyethylene, with, a, kraton, matrix, is, the, most, common, the, small, arms, protective, insert, sapi, and, the, enhanced, sapi, plate, for, the, united, states, department, of, defense, generally, has, this, form, because, of, the, use, of, ceramic, plates, for, rifle, protection, these, vests, are, 5, 8, times, as, heavy, on, an, area, basis, as, handgun, protection, the, weight, and, stiffness, of, rifle, armor, is, a, major, technical, challenge, density, hardness, and, impact, toughness, are, among, the, materials, properties, that, are, balanced, to, design, these, systems, while, ceramic, materials, have, some, outstanding, properties, for, ballistics, they, have, poor, fracture, toughness, failure, of, ceramic, plates, by, cracking, must, also, be, controlled, for, this, reason, many, ceramic, rifle, plates, are, a, composite, the, strike, face, is, ceramic, with, the, backface, formed, of, laminated, fiber, and, resin, materials, the, hardness, of, the, ceramic, prevents, the, penetration, of, the, bullet, while, the, tensile, strength, of, the, fiber, backing, helps, prevent, tensile, failure, the, u, s, military, s, small, arms, protective, insert, family, is, a, well, known, example, of, these, plates, when, a, ceramic, plate, is, shot, it, cracks, in, the, vicinity, of, the, impact, which, reduces, the, protection, in, this, area, although, nij, 0101, 06, requires, a, level, iii, plate, to, stop, six, rounds, of, 7, 62, 51mm, m80, ball, ammunition, it, imposes, a, minimum, distance, between, shots, of, 2, 0, inches, 51mm, if, two, rounds, impact, the, plate, closer, than, this, requirement, permits, it, may, result, in, a, penetration, to, counter, this, some, plates, such, as, the, ceradyne, model, aa4, and, imp, act, improved, multi, hit, performance, advanced, composite, technology, series, use, a, stainless, steel, crack, arrestor, embedded, between, the, strike, face, and, backer, this, layer, contains, cracks, in, the, strike, face, to, the, immediate, area, around, an, impact, resulting, in, markedly, improved, multi, hit, ability, in, conjunction, with, nij, iiia, soft, armor, a, 3, 9, lb, imp, act, plate, can, stop, eight, rounds, of, 5, 56, 45mm, m995, and, a, 4, 2, lb, plate, such, as, the, mh3, cqb, can, stop, either, ten, rounds, of, 5, 56, 45mm, m995, or, six, rounds, of, 7, 62, 39mm, bz, api, the, standards, for, armor, piercing, rifle, bullets, are, not, clear, cut, because, the, penetration, of, a, bullet, depends, on, the, hardness, of, the, target, armor, and, the, armor, type, however, there, are, a, few, general, rules, for, example, bullets, with, a, soft, lead, core, and, copper, jacket, are, too, easily, deformed, to, penetrate, hard, materials, whereas, rifle, bullets, intended, for, maximum, penetration, into, hard, armor, are, nearly, always, manufactured, with, high, hardness, core, materials, such, as, tungsten, carbide, most, other, core, materials, would, have, effects, between, lead, and, tungsten, carbide, many, common, bullets, such, as, the, 7, 62, 39mm, m43, standard, cartridge, for, the, ak, 47, akm, rifle, have, a, steel, core, with, hardness, rating, ranging, from, rc35, mild, steel, up, to, rc45, medium, hard, steel, however, there, is, a, caveat, to, this, rule, with, regards, to, penetration, the, hardness, of, a, bullet, s, core, is, significantly, less, important, than, the, sectional, density, of, that, bullet, this, is, why, there, are, many, more, bullets, made, with, tungsten, instead, of, tungsten, carbide, additionally, as, the, hardness, of, the, bullet, core, increases, so, must, the, amount, of, ceramic, plating, used, to, stop, penetration, like, in, soft, ballistics, a, minimum, ceramic, material, hardness, of, the, bullet, core, is, required, to, damage, their, respective, hard, core, materials, however, in, armor, piercing, rounds, the, bullet, core, is, eroded, rather, than, deformed, the, us, department, of, defense, uses, several, hard, armor, plates, the, first, the, small, arms, protective, insert, sapi, called, for, ceramic, composite, plates, with, a, mass, of, 20, 30, kg, m, 2, 4, 5, lb, ft, 2, sapi, plates, have, a, black, fabric, cover, with, the, text, 7, 62mm, m80, ball, protection, as, expected, they, are, required, to, stop, three, rounds, of, 7, 62, 51mm, m80, ball, with, the, plate, tilted, thirty, degrees, towards, the, shooter, for, the, third, shot, this, practice, is, common, for, all, three, hit, protective, plates, in, the, sapi, series, later, the, enhanced, sapi, esapi, specification, was, developed, to, protect, from, more, penetrative, ammunition, esapi, ceramic, plates, have, a, green, fabric, cover, with, the, text, 7, 62mm, apm2, protection, on, the, back, and, a, density, of, 35, 45, kg, m, 2, 7, 9, lb, ft, 2, they, are, designed, to, stop, bullets, like, the, 30, 06, ap, m2, with, a, hardened, steel, core, depending, on, revision, the, plate, may, stop, more, than, one, since, the, issuance, of, co, pd, 04, 19d, on, january, 14, 2007, esapi, plates, are, required, to, stop, three, rounds, of, m2ap, the, plates, may, be, differentiated, by, the, text, rev, on, the, back, followed, by, a, letter, a, few, years, after, the, fielding, of, the, esapi, the, department, of, defense, began, to, issue, xsapi, plates, in, response, to, a, perceived, threat, of, ap, projectiles, in, iraq, and, afghanistan, over, 120, 000, inserts, were, procured, however, the, ap, threats, they, were, meant, to, stop, never, materialized, and, the, plates, were, put, into, storage, xsapi, plates, are, required, to, stop, three, rounds, of, either, the, 7, 62, 51mm, m993, or, 5, 56, 45mm, m995, tungsten, carbide, armor, piercing, projectiles, like, newer, esapis, the, third, shot, occurs, with, the, plate, tilted, towards, the, shooter, and, are, distinguished, by, a, tan, cover, with, the, text, 7, 62mm, ap, wc, protection, on, the, back, cercom, now, bae, systems, coorstek, ceradyne, tencate, advanced, composites, honeywell, dsm, pinnacle, armor, and, a, number, of, other, engineering, companies, develop, and, manufacture, the, materials, for, composite, ceramic, rifle, armor, body, armor, standards, in, the, russian, federation, as, established, in, gost, r, 50744, 95, differ, significantly, from, american, standards, on, account, of, a, different, security, situation, the, 7, 62, 25mm, tokarev, round, is, a, relatively, common, threat, in, russia, and, is, known, to, be, able, to, penetrate, nij, iiia, soft, armor, armor, protection, in, the, face, of, the, large, numbers, of, these, rounds, therefore, necessitates, higher, standards, gost, armor, standards, are, more, stringent, than, those, of, the, nij, with, regards, to, protection, and, blunt, impact, for, example, one, of, the, highest, protection, level, gost, 6a, requires, the, armor, to, withstand, three, 7, 62, 54mmr, b32, api, hits, fired, from, 5, 10m, away, with, 16mm, of, back, face, deformation, bfd, nij, level, iv, rated, armor, is, only, required, to, stop, 1, hit, of, 30, 06, or, 7, 62, 63mm, m2ap, with, 44mm, bfd, trauma, plates, also, called, trauma, pads, are, inserts, or, pads, which, are, placed, behind, ballistic, armour, plates, panels, and, serve, to, reduce, the, blunt, force, trauma, absorbed, by, the, body, they, do, not, necessarily, have, any, ballistic, protective, properties, while, an, armour, system, hard, or, soft, may, stop, a, projectile, from, penetrating, the, projectile, may, still, cause, significant, indentation, and, deformation, of, the, armour, also, called, backface, deformation, trauma, plates, help, protect, against, damage, to, the, body, from, this, backface, deformation, trauma, plates, should, not, be, confused, with, soft, armor, or, with, ballistic, plates, both, of, which, do, inherently, provide, ballistic, protection, bomb, disposal, officers, often, wear, heavy, armor, designed, to, protect, against, most, effects, of, a, moderate, sized, explosion, such, as, bombs, encountered, in, terror, threats, full, head, helmet, covering, the, face, and, some, degree, of, protection, for, limbs, is, mandatory, in, addition, to, very, strong, armor, for, the, torso, an, insert, to, protect, the, spine, is, usually, applied, to, the, back, in, case, an, explosion, throws, the, wearer, visibility, and, mobility, of, the, wearer, is, severely, limited, as, is, the, time, that, can, be, spent, working, on, the, device, armor, designed, primarily, to, counter, explosives, is, often, somewhat, less, effective, against, bullets, than, armor, designed, for, that, purpose, the, sheer, mass, of, most, bomb, disposal, armor, usually, provides, some, protection, and, bullet, specific, armor, plates, are, compatible, with, some, bomb, disposal, suits, bomb, disposal, technicians, try, to, accomplish, their, task, if, possible, using, remote, methods, e, g, robots, line, and, pulleys, actually, laying, hands, on, a, bomb, is, only, done, in, an, extremely, life, threatening, situation, where, the, hazards, to, people, and, critical, structures, cannot, be, lessened, by, using, wheeled, robots, or, other, techniques, it, is, notable, that, despite, the, protection, offered, much, of, it, is, in, fragmentation, according, to, some, sources, overpressure, from, ordnance, beyond, the, charge, of, a, typical, hand, grenade, can, overwhelm, a, bomb, suit, in, some, media, an, eod, suit, is, portrayed, as, a, heavily, armoured, bulletproof, suit, capable, of, ignoring, explosions, and, gunfire, in, real, life, this, is, not, the, case, as, much, of, a, bomb, suit, is, made, up, of, only, soft, armor, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, state, of, california, department, of, corrections, issued, a, requirement, for, a, body, armor, using, a, commercial, ice, pick, as, the, test, penetrator, the, test, method, attempted, to, simulate, the, capacity, of, a, human, attacker, to, deliver, impact, energy, with, their, upper, body, as, was, later, shown, by, the, work, of, the, former, british, psdb, this, test, overstated, the, capacity, of, human, attackers, the, test, used, a, drop, mass, or, sabot, that, carried, the, ice, pick, using, gravitational, force, the, height, of, the, drop, mass, above, the, vest, was, proportional, to, the, impact, energy, this, test, specified, 109, joules, 81, ft, lb, of, energy, and, a, 7, 3, kg, 16, lb, drop, mass, with, a, drop, height, of, 153, cm, 60, in, the, ice, pick, has, a, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, diameter, with, a, sharp, tip, with, a, 5, 4, m, s, 17, ft, s, terminal, velocity, in, the, test, the, california, standard, did, not, include, knife, or, cutting, edge, weapons, in, the, test, protocol, the, test, method, used, the, oil, clay, roma, plastilena, tissue, simulant, as, a, test, backing, in, this, early, phase, only, titanium, and, steel, plate, offerings, were, successful, in, addressing, this, requirement, point, blank, developed, the, first, ice, pick, certified, offerings, for, ca, department, of, corrections, in, shaped, titanium, sheet, metal, vests, of, this, type, are, still, in, service, in, us, corrections, facilities, as, of, 2008, beginning, in, the, early, 1990s, an, optional, test, method, was, approved, by, california, which, permitted, the, use, of, 10, ballistic, gelatin, as, a, replacement, for, roma, clay, the, transition, from, hard, dense, clay, based, roma, to, soft, low, density, gelatin, allowed, all, textile, solutions, to, meet, this, attack, energy, requirement, soon, all, textile, ice, pick, vests, began, to, be, adopted, by, california, and, other, us, states, as, a, result, of, this, migration, in, the, test, methods, it, is, important, for, users, to, understand, that, the, smooth, round, tip, of, the, ice, pick, does, not, cut, fiber, on, impact, and, this, permits, the, use, of, textile, based, vests, for, this, application, the, earliest, of, these, all, fabric, vests, designed, to, address, this, ice, pick, test, was, warwick, mills, s, turtleskin, ultra, tightly, woven, para, aramid, fabric, with, a, patent, filed, in, 1993, shortly, after, the, turtleskin, work, in, 1995, dupont, patented, a, medium, density, fabric, that, was, designated, as, kevlar, correctional, these, textile, materials, do, not, have, equal, performance, with, cutting, edge, threats, and, these, certifications, were, only, with, ice, pick, and, were, not, tested, with, knives, parallel, to, the, us, development, of, ice, pick, vests, the, british, police, psdb, was, working, on, standards, for, knife, resistant, body, armor, their, program, adopted, a, rigorous, scientific, approach, and, collected, data, on, human, attack, capacity, their, ergonomic, study, suggested, three, levels, of, threat, 25, 35, and, 45, joules, of, impact, energy, in, addition, to, impact, energy, attack, velocities, were, measured, and, were, found, to, be, 10, 20, m, s, much, faster, than, the, california, test, two, commercial, knives, were, selected, for, use, in, this, psdb, test, method, in, order, to, test, at, a, representative, velocity, an, air, cannon, method, was, developed, to, propel, the, knife, and, sabot, at, the, vest, target, using, compressed, air, in, this, first, version, the, psdb, 93, test, also, used, oil, clay, materials, as, the, tissue, simulant, backing, the, introduction, of, knives, which, cut, fiber, and, a, hard, dense, test, backing, required, stab, vest, manufacturers, to, use, metallic, components, in, their, vest, designs, to, address, this, more, rigorous, standard, the, current, standard, hosdb, body, armour, standards, for, uk, police, 2007, part, 3, knife, and, spike, resistance, is, harmonized, with, the, us, nij, oo15, standard, use, a, drop, test, method, and, use, a, composite, foam, backing, as, a, tissue, simulant, both, the, hosdb, and, the, nij, test, now, specify, engineered, blades, double, edged, s1, and, single, edge, p1, as, well, as, the, spike, in, addition, to, the, stab, standards, hosdb, has, developed, a, standard, for, slash, resistance, 2006, this, standard, like, the, stab, standards, is, based, on, drop, testing, with, a, test, knife, in, a, mounting, of, controlled, mass, the, slash, test, uses, the, stanley, utility, knife, or, box, cutter, blades, the, slash, standard, tests, the, cut, resistance, of, the, armor, panel, parallel, to, the, direction, of, blade, travel, the, test, equipment, measures, the, force, at, the, instant, the, blade, tip, produces, a, sustained, slash, through, the, vest, the, criteria, require, that, slash, failure, of, the, armor, be, greater, than, 80, newtons, of, force, vests, that, combined, stab, and, ballistic, protection, were, a, significant, innovation, in, the, 1990s, period, of, vest, development, the, starting, point, for, this, development, were, the, ballistic, only, offerings, of, that, time, using, nij, level, 2a, 2, and, 3a, or, hosdb, hg, 1, and, 2, with, compliant, ballistic, vest, products, being, manufactured, with, areal, densities, of, between, 5, 5, and, 6, kg, m, 2, 1, 1, and, 1, 2, lb, ft, 2, or, 18, and, 20, oz, ft, 2, however, police, forces, were, evaluating, their, street, threats, and, requiring, vests, with, both, knife, and, ballistic, protection, this, multi, threat, approach, is, common, in, the, united, kingdom, and, other, european, countries, and, is, less, popular, in, the, usa, unfortunately, for, multi, threat, users, the, metallic, array, and, chainmail, systems, that, were, necessary, to, defeat, the, test, blades, offered, little, ballistic, performance, the, multi, threat, vests, have, areal, densities, close, to, the, sum, of, the, two, solutions, separately, these, vests, have, mass, values, in, the, 7, 5, 8, 5, kg, m, 2, 1, 55, 1, 75, lb, ft, 2, range, ref, nij, and, hosdb, certification, listings, rolls, royce, composites, megit, and, highmark, produced, metallic, array, systems, to, address, this, hosdb, standard, these, designs, were, used, extensively, by, the, london, metropolitan, police, service, and, other, agencies, in, the, united, kingdom, as, vest, manufacturers, and, the, specifying, authorities, worked, with, these, standards, the, uk, and, us, standards, teams, began, a, collaboration, on, test, methods, a, number, of, issues, with, the, first, versions, of, the, tests, needed, to, be, addressed, the, use, of, commercial, knives, with, inconsistent, sharpness, and, tip, shape, created, problems, with, test, consistency, as, a, result, two, new, engineered, blades, were, designed, that, could, be, manufactured, to, have, reproducible, penetrating, behavior, the, tissue, simulants, roma, clay, and, gelatin, were, either, unrepresentative, of, tissue, or, not, practical, for, the, test, operators, a, composite, foam, and, hard, rubber, test, backing, was, developed, as, an, alternative, to, address, these, issues, the, drop, test, method, was, selected, as, the, baseline, for, the, updated, standard, over, the, air, cannon, option, the, drop, mass, was, reduced, from, the, ice, pick, test, and, a, wrist, like, soft, linkage, was, engineered, into, the, penetrator, sabot, to, create, a, more, realistic, test, impact, these, closely, related, standards, were, first, issued, in, 2003, as, hosdb, 2003, and, nij, 0015, the, police, scientific, development, branch, psdb, was, renamed, the, home, office, scientific, development, branch, in, 2004, these, new, standards, created, a, focus, on, level, 1, at, 25, joules, 18, ft, lbf, level, 2, at, 35, j, 26, ft, lbf, level, 3, at, 45, j, 33, ft, lbf, protection, as, tested, with, the, new, engineered, knives, defined, in, these, test, documents, the, lowest, level, of, this, requirement, at, 25, joules, was, addressed, by, a, series, of, textile, products, of, both, wovens, coated, wovens, and, laminated, woven, materials, all, of, these, materials, were, based, on, para, aramid, fiber, the, co, efficient, of, friction, for, ultra, high, molecular, weight, polyethylene, uhmwpe, prevented, its, use, in, this, application, the, turtleskin, diamondcoat, and, twaron, srm, products, addressed, this, requirement, using, a, combination, of, para, aramid, wovens, and, bonded, ceramic, grain, these, ceramic, coated, products, do, not, have, the, flexibility, and, softness, of, un, coated, textile, materials, for, the, higher, levels, of, protection, l2, and, l3, the, very, aggressive, penetration, of, the, small, thin, p1, blade, has, resulted, in, the, continued, use, of, metallic, components, in, stab, armor, in, germany, mehler, vario, systems, developed, hybrid, vests, of, woven, para, aramid, and, chainmail, and, their, solution, was, selected, by, london, s, metropolitan, police, service, another, german, company, bsst, in, cooperation, with, warwick, mills, has, developed, a, system, to, meet, the, ballistic, stab, requirement, using, dyneema, laminate, and, an, advanced, metallic, array, system, turtleskin, mfa, this, system, is, currently, implemented, in, the, netherlands, the, trend, in, multi, threat, armor, continues, with, requirements, for, needle, protection, in, the, draft, iso, pren, iso, 14876, norm, in, many, countries, there, is, also, an, interest, to, combine, military, style, explosive, fragmentation, protection, with, bullet, ballistics, and, stab, requirements, in, order, for, ballistic, protection, to, be, wearable, the, ballistic, panels, and, or, hard, rifle, resistant, plates, are, placed, within, a, carrier, the, term, plate, carrier, is, used, specifically, to, refer, to, armour, carriers, which, can, hold, ballistic, plates, broadly, there, are, two, major, types, of, carriers, overt, carriers, and, low, profile, carriers, which, are, meant, to, be, concealed, overt, tactical, armour, carriers, typically, include, pouches, and, or, mounting, systems, like, molle, for, carrying, gear, and, are, usually, designed, to, provide, higher, amounts, of, protection, the, improved, outer, tactical, vest, and, soldier, plate, carrier, systems, are, examples, of, military, carriers, design, to, be, used, with, ballistic, plate, inserts, in, addition, to, load, carriage, this, type, of, carrier, may, include, pockets, for, neck, protection, side, plates, groin, plates, and, backside, protection, because, this, style, of, carrier, is, not, close, fitting, sizing, in, this, system, is, straightforward, for, both, men, and, women, making, custom, fabrication, unnecessary, low, profile, concealable, carriers, holds, the, ballistic, panels, and, or, ballistic, plates, close, to, the, wearer, s, body, and, a, uniform, shirt, may, be, worn, over, the, carrier, this, type, of, carrier, must, be, designed, to, conform, closely, to, the, officer, s, body, shape, for, concealable, armor, to, conform, to, the, body, it, must, be, correctly, fitted, to, a, particular, individual, many, programs, specify, full, custom, measurement, and, manufacturing, of, armor, panels, and, carriers, to, ensure, good, fit, and, comfortable, armor, officers, who, are, either, female, or, significantly, overweight, have, more, difficulty, in, getting, accurately, measured, and, having, comfortable, armor, fabricated, a, third, textile, layer, is, often, found, between, the, carrier, and, the, ballistic, components, the, ballistic, panels, are, covered, in, a, coated, pouch, or, slip, this, slip, provides, the, encapsulation, of, the, ballistic, materials, slips, are, manufactured, in, two, types, heat, sealed, hermetic, slips, and, simple, sewn, slips, for, some, ballistic, fibers, such, as, kevlar, the, slip, is, a, critical, part, of, the, system, the, slip, prevents, moisture, from, the, user, s, body, from, saturating, the, ballistic, materials, this, protection, from, moisture, cycling, increases, the, useful, life, of, the, armor, the, vast, majority, of, hard, body, armor, plates, including, the, u, s, military, s, small, arms, protective, insert, family, are, monolithic, their, strike, faces, consist, of, a, single, ceramic, tile, monolithic, plates, are, lighter, than, their, non, monolithic, counterparts, but, suffer, from, reduced, effectiveness, when, shot, multiple, times, in, a, close, area, i, e, shots, spaced, less, than, two, inches, 5, 1, cm, apart, however, several, non, monolithic, armor, systems, have, emerged, the, most, well, known, being, the, controversial, dragon, skin, system, dragon, skin, composed, of, dozens, of, overlapping, ceramic, scales, promised, superior, multi, hit, performance, and, flexibility, compared, to, the, then, current, esapi, plate, however, it, failed, to, deliver, when, the, u, s, army, tested, the, system, against, the, same, requirements, as, the, esapi, dragon, skin, showed, major, issues, with, environmental, damage, the, scales, would, come, apart, when, subjected, to, temperatures, above, 120, f, 49, c, not, uncommon, in, middle, eastern, climates, when, exposed, to, diesel, vehicle, fuel, or, after, the, two, four, foot, drop, tests, after, these, drops, esapi, plates, are, put, in, an, x, ray, machine, to, determine, the, location, of, cracks, and, then, shot, directly, on, said, cracks, leaving, the, plate, unable, to, reach, its, stated, threat, level, and, suffering, 13, first, or, second, shot, complete, penetrations, by, 30, 06, m2, ap, the, esapi, test, threat, out, of, 48, shots, perhaps, less, well, known, is, liba, light, improved, body, armor, manufactured, by, royal, tencate, ares, protection, and, mofet, etzion, in, the, early, 2000s, liba, uses, an, innovative, array, of, ceramic, pellets, embedded, in, a, polyethylene, backer, although, this, layout, lacks, the, flexibility, of, dragon, skin, it, provides, impressive, multi, hit, ability, as, well, as, the, unique, ability, to, repair, the, armor, by, replacing, damaged, pellets, and, epoxying, them, over, in, addition, there, are, variants, of, liba, with, multi, hit, capacity, against, threats, analogous, to, 7, 62, 51mm, nato, m993, ap, wc, a, tungsten, cored, armor, piercing, round, field, tests, of, liba, have, yielded, successful, results, with, 15, akm, hits, producing, only, minor, bruises, ballistic, vests, use, layers, of, very, strong, fibers, to, catch, and, deform, a, bullet, mushrooming, it, into, a, dish, shape, and, spreading, its, force, over, a, larger, portion, of, the, vest, fiber, the, vest, absorbs, the, energy, from, the, deforming, bullet, bringing, it, to, a, stop, before, it, can, completely, penetrate, the, textile, matrix, some, layers, may, be, penetrated, but, as, the, bullet, deforms, the, energy, is, absorbed, by, a, larger, and, larger, fiber, area, in, recent, years, advances, in, material, science, have, opened, the, door, to, the, idea, of, a, literal, bulletproof, vest, able, to, stop, handgun, and, rifle, bullets, with, a, soft, textile, vest, without, the, assistance, of, additional, metal, or, ceramic, plating, however, progress, is, moving, at, a, slower, rate, compared, to, other, technical, disciplines, the, most, recent, offering, from, kevlar, protera, was, released, in, 1996, current, soft, body, armor, can, stop, most, handgun, rounds, which, has, been, the, case, for, roughly, 15, years, but, armor, plates, are, needed, to, stop, rifle, rounds, and, steel, core, handgun, rounds, such, as, 7, 62, 25mm, the, para, aramids, have, not, progressed, beyond, the, limit, of, 23, grams, per, denier, in, fiber, tenacity, modest, ballistic, performance, improvements, have, been, made, by, new, producers, of, this, fiber, type, much, the, same, can, be, said, for, the, uhmwpe, material, the, basic, fiber, properties, have, only, advanced, to, the, 30, 35, g, d, range, improvements, in, this, material, have, been, seen, in, the, development, of, cross, plied, non, woven, laminate, e, g, spectra, shield, the, major, ballistic, performance, advance, of, fiber, pbo, is, known, as, a, cautionary, tale, in, materials, science, this, fiber, permitted, the, design, of, handgun, soft, armor, that, was, 30, 50, lower, in, mass, as, compared, to, the, aramid, and, uhmwpe, materials, however, this, higher, tenacity, was, delivered, with, a, well, publicized, weakness, in, environmental, durability, akzo, magellan, now, dupont, teams, have, been, working, on, fiber, called, m5, fiber, however, its, announced, startup, of, its, pilot, plant, has, been, delayed, more, than, 2, years, data, suggests, if, the, m5, material, can, be, brought, to, market, its, performance, will, be, roughly, equivalent, to, pbo, in, may, 2008, the, teijin, aramid, group, announced, a, super, fibers, development, program, the, teijin, emphasis, appears, to, be, on, computational, chemistry, to, define, a, solution, to, high, tenacity, without, environmental, weakness, the, materials, science, of, second, generation, super, fibers, is, complex, requires, large, investments, and, represent, significant, technical, challenges, research, aims, to, develop, artificial, spider, silk, which, could, be, super, strong, yet, light, and, flexible, other, research, has, been, done, to, harness, nanotechnology, to, help, create, super, strong, fibers, that, could, be, used, in, future, bulletproof, vests, in, 2018, the, us, military, began, conducting, research, into, the, feasibility, of, using, artificial, silk, as, body, armor, which, has, the, advantages, of, its, light, weight, and, its, cooling, capability, finer, yarns, and, lighter, woven, fabrics, have, been, a, key, factor, in, improving, ballistic, results, the, cost, of, ballistic, fibers, increases, dramatically, as, the, yarn, size, decreases, so, it, s, unclear, how, long, this, trend, can, continue, the, current, practical, limit, of, fiber, size, is, 200, denier, with, most, wovens, limited, at, the, 400, denier, level, three, dimensional, weaving, with, fibers, connecting, flat, wovens, together, into, a, 3d, system, are, being, considered, for, both, hard, and, soft, ballistics, team, engineering, inc, is, designing, and, weaving, these, multi, layer, materials, dyneema, dsm, has, developed, higher, performance, laminates, using, a, new, higher, strength, fiber, designated, sb61, and, hb51, dsm, feels, this, advanced, material, provides, some, improved, performance, however, the, sb61, soft, ballistic, version, has, been, recalled, at, the, shot, show, in, 2008, a, unique, composite, of, interlocking, steel, plates, and, soft, uhwmpe, plate, was, exhibited, by, turtleskin, in, combination, with, more, traditional, woven, fabrics, and, laminates, a, number, of, research, efforts, are, working, with, ballistic, felts, tex, tech, has, been, working, on, these, materials, like, the, 3d, weaving, tex, tech, sees, the, advantage, in, the, 3, axis, fiber, orientation, ballistic, nylon, until, the, 1970s, or, kevlar, twaron, or, spectra, a, competitor, for, kevlar, or, polyethylene, fiber, could, be, used, to, manufacture, bullet, proof, vests, the, vests, of, the, time, were, made, of, ballistic, nylon, supplemented, by, plates, of, fiber, glass, steel, ceramic, titanium, doron, composites, of, ceramic, and, fiberglass, the, last, being, the, most, effective, ceramic, materials, materials, processing, and, progress, in, ceramic, penetration, mechanics, are, significant, areas, of, academic, and, industrial, activity, this, combined, field, of, ceramics, armor, research, is, broad, and, is, perhaps, summarized, best, by, the, american, ceramics, society, acers, has, run, an, annual, armor, conference, for, a, number, of, years, and, compiled, a, proceedings, 2004, 2007, an, area, of, special, activity, pertaining, to, vests, is, the, emerging, use, of, small, ceramic, components, large, torso, sized, ceramic, plates, are, complex, to, manufacture, and, are, subject, to, cracking, in, use, monolithic, plates, also, have, limited, multi, hit, capacity, as, a, result, of, their, large, impact, fracture, zone, these, are, the, motivations, for, new, types, of, armor, plate, these, new, designs, use, two, and, three, dimensional, arrays, of, ceramic, elements, that, can, be, rigid, flexible, or, semi, flexible, dragon, skin, body, armor, is, one, of, these, systems, european, developments, in, spherical, and, hexagonal, arrays, have, resulted, in, products, that, have, some, flex, and, multi, hit, performance, the, manufacture, of, array, type, systems, with, flex, consistent, ballistic, performance, at, edges, of, ceramic, elements, is, an, active, area, of, research, in, addition, advanced, ceramic, processing, techniques, arrays, require, adhesive, assembly, methods, one, novel, approach, is, use, of, hook, and, loop, fasteners, to, assemble, the, ceramic, arrays, currently, there, are, a, number, of, methods, by, which, nanomaterials, are, being, implemented, into, body, armor, production, the, first, developed, at, university, of, delaware, is, based, on, nanoparticles, within, the, suit, that, become, rigid, enough, to, protect, the, wearer, as, soon, as, a, kinetic, energy, threshold, is, surpassed, these, coatings, have, been, described, as, shear, thickening, fluids, these, nano, infused, fabrics, have, been, licensed, by, bae, systems, but, as, of, mid, 2008, no, products, have, been, released, based, on, this, technology, in, 2005, an, israeli, company, apnano, developed, a, material, that, was, always, rigid, it, was, announced, that, this, nanocomposite, based, on, tungsten, disulfide, nanotubes, was, able, to, withstand, shocks, generated, by, a, steel, projectile, traveling, at, velocities, of, up, to, 1, 5, km, s, the, material, was, also, reportedly, able, to, withstand, shock, pressures, generated, by, other, impacts, of, up, to, 250, metric, tons, force, per, square, centimeter, 24, 5, gigapascals, 3, 550, 000, psi, during, the, tests, the, material, proved, to, be, so, strong, that, after, the, impact, the, samples, remained, essentially, unmarred, additionally, a, study, in, france, tested, the, material, under, isostatic, pressure, and, found, it, to, be, stable, up, to, at, least, 350, tf, cm, 2, 34, gpa, 5, 000, 000, psi, as, of, mid, 2008, spider, silk, bulletproof, vests, and, nano, based, armors, are, being, developed, for, potential, market, release, both, the, british, and, american, militaries, have, expressed, interest, in, a, carbon, fiber, woven, from, carbon, nanotubes, that, was, developed, at, university, of, cambridge, and, has, the, potential, to, be, used, as, body, armor, in, 2008, large, format, carbon, nanotube, sheets, began, being, produced, at, nanocomp, in, late, 2014, researchers, began, studying, and, testing, graphene, as, a, material, for, use, in, body, armor, graphene, is, manufactured, from, carbon, and, is, the, thinnest, strongest, and, most, conductive, material, on, the, planet, taking, the, form, of, hexagonally, arranged, atoms, its, tensile, strength, is, known, to, be, 200, times, greater, than, steel, but, studies, from, rice, university, have, revealed, it, is, also, 10, times, better, than, steel, at, dissipating, energy, an, ability, that, had, previously, not, been, thoroughly, explored, to, test, its, properties, the, university, of, massachusetts, stacked, together, graphene, sheets, only, a, single, carbon, atom, thick, creating, layers, ranging, in, thickness, from, 10, nanometers, to, 100, nanometers, from, 300, layers, microscopic, spherical, silica, bullets, were, fired, at, the, sheets, at, speeds, of, up, to, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, per, second, almost, nine, times, the, speed, of, sound, upon, impact, the, projectiles, deformed, into, a, cone, shape, around, the, graphene, before, ultimately, breaking, through, in, the, three, nanoseconds, it, held, together, however, the, transferred, energy, traveled, through, the, material, at, a, speed, of, 22, 2, km, 13, 8, mi, per, second, faster, than, any, other, known, material, if, the, impact, stress, can, be, spread, out, over, a, large, enough, area, that, the, cone, moves, out, at, an, appreciable, velocity, compared, with, the, velocity, of, the, projectile, stress, will, not, be, localized, under, where, it, hit, although, a, wide, impact, hole, opened, up, a, composite, mixture, of, graphene, and, other, materials, could, be, made, to, create, a, new, revolutionary, armor, solution, in, australia, it, is, illegal, to, import, body, armour, without, prior, authorisation, from, australian, customs, and, border, protection, service, it, is, also, illegal, to, possess, body, armour, without, authorization, in, south, australia, victoria, northern, territory, act, queensland, new, south, wales, and, tasmania, united, states, law, restricts, possession, of, body, armor, for, convicted, violent, felons, many, u, s, states, also, have, penalties, for, possession, or, use, of, body, armor, by, felons, in, other, states, such, as, kentucky, possession, is, not, prohibited, but, probation, or, parole, is, denied, to, a, person, convicted, of, committing, certain, violent, crimes, while, wearing, body, armor, and, carrying, a, deadly, weapon, most, states, do, not, have, restrictions, for, non, felons, in, all, canadian, provinces, except, for, alberta, british, columbia, and, manitoba, it, is, legal, to, wear, and, to, purchase, body, armour, such, as, ballistic, vests, under, the, laws, of, these, provinces, it, is, illegal, to, possess, body, armour, without, a, license, unless, exempted, issued, by, the, provincial, government, as, of, february, 2019, nova, scotia, allows, only, those, who, require, such, armour, due, to, their, employment, to, own, body, armor, such, as, police, and, corrections, officers, citing, the, use, of, body, armor, by, criminals, according, to, the, body, armour, control, act, of, alberta, which, came, into, force, on, june, 15, 2012, any, individual, in, possession, of, a, valid, firearms, licence, under, the, firearms, act, of, canada, can, legally, purchase, possess, and, wear, body, armour, under, schedule, c, item, ml13, of, cap, 60g, import, and, export, strategic, commodities, regulations, armoured, or, protective, equipment, constructions, and, components, are, not, regulated, when, accompanying, their, user, for, the, user, s, own, personal, protection, in, the, european, union, the, import, and, sale, of, ballistic, vests, and, body, armor, is, allowed, there, is, an, exception, for, vests, that, are, developed, under, strict, military, specifications, and, or, for, main, military, usage, shield, above, the, level, of, protection, nij, 4, are, considered, by, the, law, as, armament, materials, and, forbidden, for, civilian, use, there, are, many, shops, in, the, eu, that, sell, ballistic, vests, and, body, armor, used, or, new, in, italy, the, purchase, ownership, and, wear, of, ballistic, vests, and, body, armor, is, not, subject, to, any, restriction, except, for, those, ballistic, protections, that, are, developed, under, strict, military, specifications, and, or, for, main, military, usage, thus, considered, by, the, law, as, armament, materials, and, forbidden, to, civilians, furthermore, a, number, of, laws, and, court, rulings, during, the, years, have, rehearsed, the, concept, of, a, ballistic, vest, being, mandatory, to, wear, for, those, individuals, who, work, in, the, private, security, sector, in, the, netherlands, the, civilian, ownership, of, body, armour, is, subject, to, the, european, union, regulations, body, armour, in, various, ballistic, grades, is, sold, by, a, range, of, different, vendors, mainly, aimed, at, providing, to, security, guards, and, vip, s, the, use, of, body, armour, while, committing, a, crime, is, not, an, additional, offence, in, itself, but, may, be, interpreted, as, so, under, different, laws, such, as, resisting, arrest
