an, antireflective, antiglare, or, anti, reflection, ar, coating, is, a, type, of, optical, coating, applied, to, the, surface, of, lenses, other, optical, elements, and, photovoltaic, cells, to, reduce, reflection, in, typical, imaging, systems, this, improves, the, efficiency, since, less, light, is, lost, due, to, reflection, in, complex, systems, such, as, cameras, binoculars, telescopes, and, microscopes, the, reduction, in, reflections, also, improves, the, contrast, of, the, image, by, elimination, of, stray, light, this, is, especially, important, in, planetary, astronomy, in, other, applications, the, primary, benefit, is, the, elimination, of, the, reflection, itself, such, as, a, coating, on, eyeglass, lenses, that, makes, the, eyes, of, the, wearer, more, visible, to, others, or, a, coating, to, reduce, the, glint, from, a, covert, viewer, s, binoculars, or, telescopic, sight, many, coatings, consist, of, transparent, thin, film, structures, with, alternating, layers, of, contrasting, refractive, index, layer, thicknesses, are, chosen, to, produce, destructive, interference, in, the, beams, reflected, from, the, interfaces, and, constructive, interference, in, the, corresponding, transmitted, beams, this, makes, the, structure, s, performance, change, with, wavelength, and, incident, angle, so, that, color, effects, often, appear, at, oblique, angles, a, wavelength, range, must, be, specified, when, designing, or, ordering, such, coatings, but, good, performance, can, often, be, achieved, for, a, relatively, wide, range, of, frequencies, usually, a, choice, of, ir, visible, or, uv, is, offered, anti, reflective, coatings, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, where, light, passes, through, an, optical, surface, and, low, loss, or, low, reflection, is, desired, examples, include, anti, glare, coatings, on, corrective, lenses, and, camera, lens, elements, and, antireflective, coatings, on, solar, cells, opticians, may, recommend, anti, reflection, lenses, because, the, decreased, reflection, enhances, the, cosmetic, appearance, of, the, lenses, such, lenses, are, often, said, to, reduce, glare, but, the, reduction, is, very, slight, eliminating, reflections, allows, slightly, more, light, to, pass, through, producing, a, slight, increase, in, contrast, and, visual, acuity, antireflective, ophthalmic, lenses, should, not, be, confused, with, polarized, lenses, which, are, found, only, in, sunglasses, and, decrease, by, absorption, the, visible, glare, of, sun, reflected, off, surfaces, such, as, sand, water, and, roads, the, term, antireflective, relates, to, the, reflection, from, the, surface, of, the, lens, itself, not, the, origin, of, the, light, that, reaches, the, lens, many, anti, reflection, lenses, include, an, additional, coating, that, repels, water, and, grease, making, them, easier, to, keep, clean, anti, reflection, coatings, are, particularly, suited, to, high, index, lenses, as, these, reflect, more, light, without, the, coating, than, a, lower, index, lens, a, consequence, of, the, fresnel, equations, it, is, also, generally, easier, and, cheaper, to, coat, high, index, lenses, antireflective, coatings, arc, are, often, used, in, microelectronic, photolithography, to, help, reduce, image, distortions, associated, with, reflections, off, the, surface, of, the, substrate, different, types, of, antireflective, coatings, are, applied, either, before, bottom, arc, or, barc, or, after, the, photoresist, and, help, reduce, standing, waves, thin, film, interference, and, specular, reflections, solar, cells, are, often, coated, with, an, anti, reflective, coating, materials, that, have, been, used, include, magnesium, fluoride, silicon, nitride, silicon, dioxide, titanium, dioxide, and, aluminum, oxide, the, simplest, form, of, anti, reflective, coating, was, discovered, by, lord, rayleigh, in, 1886, the, optical, glass, available, at, the, time, tended, to, develop, a, tarnish, on, its, surface, with, age, due, to, chemical, reactions, with, the, environment, rayleigh, tested, some, old, slightly, tarnished, pieces, of, glass, and, found, to, his, surprise, that, they, transmitted, more, light, than, new, clean, pieces, the, tarnish, replaces, the, air, glass, interface, with, two, interfaces, an, air, tarnish, interface, and, a, tarnish, glass, interface, because, the, tarnish, has, a, refractive, index, between, those, of, glass, and, air, each, of, these, interfaces, exhibits, less, reflection, than, the, air, glass, interface, did, in, fact, the, total, of, the, two, reflections, is, less, than, that, of, the, naked, air, glass, interface, as, can, be, calculated, from, the, fresnel, equations, one, approach, is, to, use, graded, index, grin, anti, reflective, coatings, that, is, ones, with, nearly, continuously, varying, indices, of, refraction, with, these, it, is, possible, to, curtail, reflection, for, a, broad, band, of, frequencies, and, incidence, angles, the, simplest, interference, anti, reflective, coating, consists, of, a, single, thin, layer, of, transparent, material, with, refractive, index, equal, to, the, square, root, of, the, substrate, s, refractive, index, in, air, such, a, coating, theoretically, gives, zero, reflectance, for, light, with, wavelength, in, the, coating, equal, to, four, times, the, coating, s, thickness, reflectance, is, also, decreased, for, wavelengths, in, a, broad, band, around, the, center, a, layer, of, thickness, equal, to, a, quarter, of, some, design, wavelength, is, called, a, quarter, wave, layer, the, most, common, type, of, optical, glass, is, crown, glass, which, has, an, index, of, refraction, of, about, 1, 52, an, optimal, single, layer, coating, would, have, to, be, made, of, a, material, with, an, index, of, about, 1, 23, there, are, no, solid, materials, with, such, a, low, refractive, index, the, closest, materials, with, good, physical, properties, for, a, coating, are, magnesium, fluoride, mgf, 2, with, an, index, of, 1, 38, and, fluoropolymers, which, can, have, indices, as, low, as, 1, 30, but, are, more, difficult, to, apply, mgf, 2, on, a, crown, glass, surface, gives, a, reflectance, of, about, 1, compared, to, 4, for, bare, glass, mgf, 2, coatings, perform, much, better, on, higher, index, glasses, especially, those, with, index, of, refraction, close, to, 1, 9, mgf, 2, coatings, are, commonly, used, because, they, are, cheap, and, durable, when, the, coatings, are, designed, for, a, wavelength, in, the, middle, of, the, visible, band, they, give, reasonably, good, anti, reflection, over, the, entire, band, researchers, have, produced, films, of, mesoporous, silica, nanoparticles, with, refractive, indices, as, low, as, 1, 12, which, function, as, antireflection, coatings, by, using, alternating, layers, of, a, low, index, material, like, silica, and, a, higher, index, material, it, is, possible, to, obtain, reflectivities, as, low, as, 0, 1, at, a, single, wavelength, coatings, that, give, very, low, reflectivity, over, a, broad, band, of, frequencies, can, also, be, made, although, these, are, complex, and, relatively, expensive, optical, coatings, can, also, be, made, with, special, characteristics, such, as, near, zero, reflectance, at, multiple, wavelengths, or, optimal, performance, at, angles, of, incidence, other, than, 0, an, additional, category, of, anti, reflection, coatings, is, the, so, called, absorbing, arc, these, coatings, are, useful, in, situations, where, high, transmission, through, a, surface, is, unimportant, or, undesirable, but, low, reflectivity, is, required, they, can, produce, very, low, reflectance, with, few, layers, and, can, often, be, produced, more, cheaply, or, at, greater, scale, than, standard, non, absorbing, ar, coatings, see, for, example, us, patent, 5, 091, 244, absorbing, arcs, often, make, use, of, unusual, optical, properties, exhibited, in, compound, thin, films, produced, by, sputter, deposition, for, example, titanium, nitride, and, niobium, nitride, are, used, in, absorbing, arcs, these, can, be, useful, in, applications, requiring, contrast, enhancement, or, as, a, replacement, for, tinted, glass, for, example, in, a, crt, display, moths, eyes, have, an, unusual, property, their, surfaces, are, covered, with, a, natural, nanostructured, film, which, eliminates, reflections, this, allows, the, moth, to, see, well, in, the, dark, without, reflections, to, give, its, location, away, to, predators, the, structure, consists, of, a, hexagonal, pattern, of, bumps, each, roughly, 200, nm, high, and, spaced, on, 300, nm, centers, this, kind, of, antireflective, coating, works, because, the, bumps, are, smaller, than, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, so, the, light, sees, the, surface, as, having, a, continuous, refractive, index, gradient, between, the, air, and, the, medium, which, decreases, reflection, by, effectively, removing, the, air, lens, interface, practical, anti, reflective, films, have, been, made, by, humans, using, this, effect, this, is, a, form, of, biomimicry, canon, uses, the, moth, eye, technique, in, their, sub, wavelength, structure, coating, which, significantly, reduces, lens, flare, such, structures, are, also, used, in, photonic, devices, for, example, moth, eye, structures, grown, from, tungsten, oxide, and, iron, oxide, can, be, used, as, photoelectrodes, for, splitting, water, to, produce, hydrogen, the, structure, consists, of, tungsten, oxide, spheroids, several, hundred, micrometers, in, diameter, coated, with, a, few, nanometers, of, iron, oxide, a, circular, polarizer, laminated, to, a, surface, can, be, used, to, eliminate, reflections, the, polarizer, transmits, light, with, one, chirality, handedness, of, circular, polarization, light, reflected, from, the, surface, after, the, polarizer, is, transformed, into, the, opposite, handedness, this, light, cannot, pass, back, through, the, circular, polarizer, because, its, chirality, has, changed, e, g, from, right, circular, polarized, to, left, circularly, polarized, a, disadvantage, of, this, method, is, that, if, the, input, light, is, unpolarized, the, transmission, through, the, assembly, will, be, less, than, 50, there, are, two, separate, causes, of, optical, effects, due, to, coatings, often, called, thick, film, and, thin, film, effects, thick, film, effects, arise, because, of, the, difference, in, the, index, of, refraction, between, the, layers, above, and, below, the, coating, or, film, in, the, simplest, case, these, three, layers, are, the, air, the, coating, and, the, glass, thick, film, coatings, do, not, depend, on, how, thick, the, coating, is, so, long, as, the, coating, is, much, thicker, than, a, wavelength, of, light, thin, film, effects, arise, when, the, thickness, of, the, coating, is, approximately, the, same, as, a, quarter, or, a, half, a, wavelength, of, light, in, this, case, the, reflections, of, a, steady, source, of, light, can, be, made, to, add, destructively, and, hence, reduce, reflections, by, a, separate, mechanism, in, addition, to, depending, very, much, on, the, thickness, of, the, film, and, the, wavelength, of, light, thin, film, coatings, depend, on, the, angle, at, which, the, light, strikes, the, coated, surface, whenever, a, ray, of, light, moves, from, one, medium, to, another, for, example, when, light, enters, a, sheet, of, glass, after, travelling, through, air, some, portion, of, the, light, is, reflected, from, the, surface, known, as, the, interface, between, the, two, media, this, can, be, observed, when, looking, through, a, window, for, instance, where, a, weak, reflection, from, the, front, and, back, surfaces, of, the, window, glass, can, be, seen, the, strength, of, the, reflection, depends, on, the, ratio, of, the, refractive, indices, of, the, two, media, as, well, as, the, angle, of, the, surface, to, the, beam, of, light, the, exact, value, can, be, calculated, using, the, fresnel, equations, when, the, light, meets, the, interface, at, normal, incidence, perpendicularly, to, the, surface, the, intensity, of, light, reflected, is, given, by, the, reflection, coefficient, or, reflectance, r, where, n, 0, and, n, s, are, the, refractive, indices, of, the, first, and, second, media, respectively, the, value, of, r, varies, from, 0, no, reflection, to, 1, all, light, reflected, and, is, usually, quoted, as, a, percentage, complementary, to, r, is, the, transmission, coefficient, or, transmittance, t, if, absorption, and, scattering, are, neglected, then, the, value, t, is, always, 1, r, thus, if, a, beam, of, light, with, intensity, i, is, incident, on, the, surface, a, beam, of, intensity, ri, is, reflected, and, a, beam, with, intensity, ti, is, transmitted, into, the, medium, for, the, simplified, scenario, of, visible, light, travelling, from, air, n, 0, 1, 0, into, common, glass, n, s, 1, 5, the, value, of, r, is, 0, 04, or, 4, on, a, single, reflection, so, at, most, 96, of, the, light, t, 1, r, 0, 96, actually, enters, the, glass, and, the, rest, is, reflected, from, the, surface, the, amount, of, light, reflected, is, known, as, the, reflection, loss, in, the, more, complicated, scenario, of, multiple, reflections, say, with, light, travelling, through, a, window, light, is, reflected, both, when, going, from, air, to, glass, and, at, the, other, side, of, the, window, when, going, from, glass, back, to, air, the, size, of, the, loss, is, the, same, in, both, cases, light, also, may, bounce, from, one, surface, to, another, multiple, times, being, partially, reflected, and, partially, transmitted, each, time, it, does, so, in, all, the, combined, reflection, coefficient, is, given, by, 2, r, 1, r, for, glass, in, air, this, is, about, 7, 7, as, observed, by, lord, rayleigh, a, thin, film, such, as, tarnish, on, the, surface, of, glass, can, reduce, the, reflectivity, this, effect, can, be, explained, by, envisioning, a, thin, layer, of, material, with, refractive, index, n, 1, between, the, air, index, n, 0, and, the, glass, index, n, s, the, light, ray, now, reflects, twice, once, from, the, surface, between, air, and, the, thin, layer, and, once, from, the, layer, to, glass, interface, from, the, equation, above, and, the, known, refractive, indices, reflectivities, for, both, interfaces, can, be, calculated, denoted, r, 01, and, r, 1s, respectively, the, transmission, at, each, interface, is, therefore, t, 01, 1, r, 01, and, t, 1s, 1, r, 1s, the, total, transmittance, into, the, glass, is, thus, t, 1s, t, 01, calculating, this, value, for, various, values, of, n, 1, it, can, be, found, that, at, one, particular, value, of, optimal, refractive, index, of, the, layer, the, transmittance, of, both, interfaces, is, equal, and, this, corresponds, to, the, maximal, total, transmittance, into, the, glass, this, optimal, value, is, given, by, the, geometric, mean, of, the, two, surrounding, indices, for, the, example, of, glass, n, s, 1, 5, in, air, n, 0, 1, 0, this, optimal, refractive, index, is, n, 1, 1, 225, the, reflection, loss, of, each, interface, is, approximately, 1, 0, with, a, combined, loss, of, 2, 0, and, an, overall, transmission, t, 1s, t, 01, of, approximately, 98, therefore, an, intermediate, coating, between, the, air, and, glass, can, halve, the, reflection, loss, the, use, of, an, intermediate, layer, to, form, an, anti, reflection, coating, can, be, thought, of, as, analogous, to, the, technique, of, impedance, matching, of, electrical, signals, a, similar, method, is, used, in, fibre, optic, research, where, an, index, matching, oil, is, sometimes, used, to, temporarily, defeat, total, internal, reflection, so, that, light, may, be, coupled, into, or, out, of, a, fiber, further, reduced, reflection, could, in, theory, be, made, by, extending, the, process, to, several, layers, of, material, gradually, blending, the, refractive, index, of, each, layer, between, the, index, of, the, air, and, the, index, of, the, substrate, practical, anti, reflection, coatings, however, rely, on, an, intermediate, layer, not, only, for, its, direct, reduction, of, reflection, coefficient, but, also, use, the, interference, effect, of, a, thin, layer, assume, the, layer, s, thickness, is, controlled, precisely, such, that, it, is, exactly, one, quarter, of, the, wavelength, of, light, in, the, layer, 4, 0, 4, n, 1, where, 0, is, the, vacuum, wavelength, the, layer, is, then, called, a, quarter, wave, coating, for, this, type, of, coating, a, normally, incident, beam, i, when, reflected, from, the, second, interface, will, travel, exactly, half, its, own, wavelength, further, than, the, beam, reflected, from, the, first, surface, leading, to, destructive, interference, this, is, also, true, for, thicker, coating, layers, 3, 4, 5, 4, etc, however, the, anti, reflective, performance, is, worse, in, this, case, due, to, the, stronger, dependence, of, the, reflectance, on, wavelength, and, the, angle, of, incidence, if, the, intensities, of, the, two, beams, r, 1, and, r, 2, are, exactly, equal, they, will, destructively, interfere, and, cancel, each, other, since, they, are, exactly, out, of, phase, therefore, there, is, no, reflection, from, the, surface, and, all, the, energy, of, the, beam, must, be, in, the, transmitted, ray, t, in, the, calculation, of, the, reflection, from, a, stack, of, layers, the, transfer, matrix, method, can, be, used, real, coatings, do, not, reach, perfect, performance, though, they, are, capable, of, reducing, a, surface, reflection, coefficient, to, less, than, 0, 1, also, the, layer, will, have, the, ideal, thickness, for, only, one, distinct, wavelength, of, light, other, difficulties, include, finding, suitable, materials, for, use, on, ordinary, glass, since, few, useful, substances, have, the, required, refractive, index, n, 1, 23, that, will, make, both, reflected, rays, exactly, equal, in, intensity, magnesium, fluoride, mgf, 2, is, often, used, since, this, is, hard, wearing, and, can, be, easily, applied, to, substrates, using, physical, vapor, deposition, even, though, its, index, is, higher, than, desirable, n, 1, 38, further, reduction, is, possible, by, using, multiple, coating, layers, designed, such, that, reflections, from, the, surfaces, undergo, maximal, destructive, interference, one, way, to, do, this, is, to, add, a, second, quarter, wave, thick, higher, index, layer, between, the, low, index, layer, and, the, substrate, the, reflection, from, all, three, interfaces, produces, destructive, interference, and, anti, reflection, other, techniques, use, varying, thicknesses, of, the, coatings, by, using, two, or, more, layers, each, of, a, material, chosen, to, give, the, best, possible, match, of, the, desired, refractive, index, and, dispersion, broadband, anti, reflection, coatings, covering, the, visible, range, 400, 700, nm, with, maximal, reflectivity, of, less, than, 0, 5, are, commonly, achievable, the, exact, nature, of, the, coating, determines, the, appearance, of, the, coated, optic, common, ar, coatings, on, eyeglasses, and, photographic, lenses, often, look, somewhat, bluish, since, they, reflect, slightly, more, blue, light, than, other, visible, wavelengths, though, green, and, pink, tinged, coatings, are, also, used, if, the, coated, optic, is, used, at, non, normal, incidence, that, is, with, light, rays, not, perpendicular, to, the, surface, the, anti, reflection, capabilities, are, degraded, somewhat, this, occurs, because, the, phase, accumulated, in, the, layer, relative, to, the, phase, of, the, light, immediately, reflected, decreases, as, the, angle, increases, from, normal, this, is, counterintuitive, since, the, ray, experiences, a, greater, total, phase, shift, in, the, layer, than, for, normal, incidence, this, paradox, is, resolved, by, noting, that, the, ray, will, exit, the, layer, spatially, offset, from, where, it, entered, and, will, interfere, with, reflections, from, incoming, rays, that, had, to, travel, further, thus, accumulating, more, phase, of, their, own, to, arrive, at, the, interface, the, net, effect, is, that, the, relative, phase, is, actually, reduced, shifting, the, coating, such, that, the, anti, reflection, band, of, the, coating, tends, to, move, to, shorter, wavelengths, as, the, optic, is, tilted, non, normal, incidence, angles, also, usually, cause, the, reflection, to, be, polarization, dependent, reflection, can, be, reduced, by, texturing, the, surface, with, 3d, pyramids, or, 2d, grooves, gratings, these, kind, of, textured, coating, can, be, created, using, for, example, the, langmuir, blodgett, method, if, wavelength, is, greater, than, the, texture, size, the, texture, behaves, like, a, gradient, index, film, with, reduced, reflection, to, calculate, reflection, in, this, case, effective, medium, approximations, can, be, used, to, minimize, reflection, various, profiles, of, pyramids, have, been, proposed, such, as, cubic, quintic, or, integral, exponential, profiles, if, wavelength, is, smaller, than, the, textured, size, the, reflection, reduction, can, be, explained, with, the, help, of, the, geometric, optics, approximation, rays, should, be, reflected, many, times, before, they, are, sent, back, toward, the, source, in, this, case, the, reflection, can, be, calculated, using, ray, tracing, using, texture, reduces, reflection, for, wavelengths, comparable, with, the, feature, size, as, well, in, this, case, no, approximation, is, valid, and, reflection, can, be, calculated, by, solving, maxwell, equations, numerically, antireflective, properties, of, textured, surfaces, are, well, discussed, in, literature, for, a, wide, range, of, size, to, wavelength, ratios, including, long, and, short, wave, limits, to, find, the, optimal, texture, size, as, mentioned, above, natural, index, matching, coatings, were, discovered, by, lord, rayleigh, in, 1886, harold, dennis, taylor, of, cooke, company, developed, a, chemical, method, for, producing, such, coatings, in, 1904, interference, based, coatings, were, invented, and, developed, in, 1935, by, olexander, smakula, who, was, working, for, the, carl, zeiss, optics, company, these, coatings, remained, a, german, military, secret, for, several, years, until, the, allies, discovered, the, secret, during, world, war, ii, katharine, burr, blodgett, and, irving, langmuir, developed, organic, anti, reflection, coatings, known, as, langmuir, blodgett, films, in, the, late, 1930s
