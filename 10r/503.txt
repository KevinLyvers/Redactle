a, land, mine, or, landmine, is, an, explosive, weapon, concealed, under, or, camouflaged, on, the, ground, and, designed, to, destroy, or, disable, enemy, targets, ranging, from, combatants, to, vehicles, and, tanks, as, they, pass, over, or, near, it, such, a, device, is, typically, detonated, automatically, by, way, of, pressure, when, a, target, steps, on, it, or, drives, over, it, although, other, detonation, mechanisms, are, also, sometimes, used, a, land, mine, may, cause, damage, by, direct, blast, effect, by, fragments, that, are, thrown, by, the, blast, or, by, both, land, mines, are, typically, laid, throughout, an, area, creating, a, minefield, which, is, dangerous, to, cross, the, use, of, land, mines, is, controversial, because, of, their, potential, as, indiscriminate, weapons, they, can, remain, dangerous, many, years, after, a, conflict, has, ended, harming, civilians, and, the, economy, with, pressure, from, a, number, of, campaign, groups, organised, through, the, international, campaign, to, ban, landmines, a, global, movement, to, prohibit, their, use, led, to, the, 1997, convention, on, the, prohibition, of, the, use, stockpiling, production, and, transfer, of, anti, personnel, mines, and, on, their, destruction, also, known, as, the, ottawa, treaty, to, date, 164, nations, have, signed, the, treaty, however, china, the, russian, federation, and, the, united, states, are, not, signatories, in, the, anti, personnel, mine, ban, convention, also, known, as, the, ottawa, treaty, and, the, protocol, on, mines, booby, traps, and, other, devices, a, mine, is, defined, as, a, munition, designed, to, be, placed, under, on, or, near, the, ground, or, other, surface, area, and, to, be, exploded, by, the, presence, proximity, or, contact, of, a, person, or, vehicle, similar, in, function, is, the, booby, trap, which, the, protocol, defines, as, any, device, or, material, which, is, designed, constructed, or, adapted, to, kill, or, injure, and, which, functions, unexpectedly, when, a, person, disturbs, or, approaches, an, apparently, harmless, object, or, performs, an, apparently, safe, act, such, actions, might, include, opening, a, door, or, picking, up, an, object, normally, mines, are, mass, produced, and, placed, in, groups, while, booby, traps, are, improvised, and, deployed, one, at, a, time, also, booby, traps, can, be, non, explosive, devices, such, as, punji, sticks, overlapping, both, categories, is, the, improvised, explosive, device, ied, which, is, a, device, placed, or, fabricated, in, an, improvised, manner, incorporating, explosive, material, destructive, lethal, noxious, incendiary, pyrotechnic, materials, or, chemicals, designed, to, destroy, disfigure, distract, or, harass, they, may, incorporate, military, stores, but, are, normally, devised, from, non, military, components, some, meet, the, definition, of, mines, or, booby, traps, and, are, also, referred, to, as, improvised, artisanal, or, locally, manufactured, mines, other, types, of, ied, are, remotely, activated, so, are, not, considered, mines, remotely, delivered, mines, are, dropped, from, aircraft, or, carried, by, devices, such, as, artillery, shells, or, rockets, another, type, of, remotely, delivered, explosive, is, the, cluster, munition, a, device, that, releases, several, sub, munitions, bomblets, over, a, large, area, the, use, transfer, production, and, stockpiling, of, cluster, munitions, is, prohibited, by, the, international, ccm, treaty, if, bomblets, do, not, explode, they, are, referred, to, as, unexploded, ordnance, uxo, along, with, unexploded, artillery, shells, and, other, explosive, devices, that, were, not, manually, placed, that, is, mines, and, booby, traps, are, not, uxos, explosive, remnants, of, war, erw, include, uxos, and, abandoned, explosive, ordnance, axo, devices, that, were, never, used, and, were, left, behind, after, a, conflict, land, mines, are, divided, into, two, types, anti, tank, mines, which, are, designed, to, disable, tanks, or, other, vehicles, and, anti, personnel, mines, which, are, designed, to, injure, or, kill, people, the, history, of, land, mines, can, be, divided, into, three, main, phases, in, the, ancient, world, buried, spikes, provided, many, of, the, same, functions, as, modern, mines, mines, using, gunpowder, as, the, explosive, were, used, from, the, ming, dynasty, to, the, american, civil, war, subsequently, high, explosives, were, developed, for, use, in, land, mines, some, fortifications, in, the, roman, empire, were, surrounded, by, a, series, of, hazards, buried, in, the, ground, these, included, goads, one, foot, long, 30, cm, pieces, of, wood, with, iron, hooks, on, their, ends, lilia, lilies, so, named, after, their, appearance, which, were, pits, in, which, sharpened, logs, were, arranged, in, a, five, point, pattern, and, abatis, fallen, trees, with, sharpened, branches, facing, outwards, as, with, modern, land, mines, they, were, victim, operated, often, concealed, and, formed, zones, that, were, wide, enough, so, that, the, enemy, could, not, do, much, harm, from, outside, but, were, under, fire, from, spear, throws, in, this, case, if, they, attempted, to, remove, the, obstacles, a, notable, use, of, these, defenses, was, by, julius, caesar, in, the, battle, of, alesia, his, forces, were, besieging, vercingetorix, the, leader, of, the, gauls, but, vercingetorix, managed, to, send, for, reinforcements, to, maintain, the, siege, and, defend, against, the, reinforcements, caesar, formed, a, line, of, fortifications, on, both, sides, and, they, played, an, important, role, in, his, victory, lilies, were, also, used, by, scots, against, the, english, at, the, battle, of, bannockburn, in, 1314, and, by, germans, at, the, battle, of, passchendaele, in, the, first, world, war, a, more, easily, deployed, defense, used, by, the, romans, was, the, caltrop, a, weapon, 12, 15, cm, across, with, four, sharp, spikes, that, are, oriented, so, that, when, it, is, thrown, on, the, ground, one, spike, always, points, up, as, with, modern, antipersonnel, mines, caltrops, are, designed, to, disable, soldiers, rather, than, kill, them, they, are, also, more, effective, in, stopping, mounted, forces, who, lack, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, carefully, scrutinize, each, step, they, take, though, forcing, foot, mounted, forces, to, take, the, time, to, do, so, has, benefits, in, and, of, itself, they, were, used, by, the, jin, dynasty, in, china, at, the, battle, of, zhongdu, to, slow, down, the, advance, of, genghis, khan, s, army, joan, of, arc, was, wounded, by, one, in, the, siege, of, orl, ans, in, japan, they, are, known, as, tetsu, bishu, and, were, used, by, ninjas, from, the, fourteenth, century, onward, caltrops, are, still, strung, together, and, used, as, roadblocks, in, some, modern, conflicts, gunpowder, an, explosive, mixture, of, sulfur, charcoal, and, potassium, nitrate, was, invented, in, china, by, the, 10th, century, and, was, used, in, warfare, soon, after, an, enormous, bomb, credited, to, lou, qianxia, was, used, in, 1277, by, the, chinese, at, the, battle, of, zhongdu, a, 14th, century, military, treatise, the, huolongjing, fire, dragon, manual, describes, hollow, cast, iron, cannonball, shells, filled, with, gunpowder, the, wad, of, the, mine, was, made, of, hard, wood, carrying, three, different, fuses, in, case, of, defective, connection, to, the, touch, hole, these, fuses, were, long, and, lit, by, hand, so, they, required, carefully, timed, calculations, of, enemy, movements, the, huolongjing, also, describes, land, mines, that, were, set, off, by, enemy, movement, a, 9, foot, 3, m, length, of, bamboo, was, waterproofed, by, wrapping, it, in, cowhide, and, covering, it, with, oil, it, was, filled, with, compressed, gunpowder, and, lead, or, iron, pellets, sealed, with, wax, and, concealed, in, a, trench, the, triggering, mechanism, was, not, fully, described, until, the, early, 17th, century, when, the, enemy, stepped, onto, hidden, boards, they, dislodged, a, pin, causing, a, weight, to, fall, a, cord, attached, to, the, weight, was, wrapped, around, a, drum, attached, to, two, steel, wheels, when, the, weight, fell, the, wheels, struck, sparks, against, flint, igniting, a, set, of, fuses, leading, to, multiple, mines, a, similar, mechanism, was, used, in, the, first, wheellock, musket, in, europe, as, sketched, by, leonardo, da, vinci, around, 1500, ad, another, victim, operated, device, was, the, underground, sky, soaring, thunder, which, lured, bounty, hunters, with, halberds, pikes, and, lances, planted, in, the, ground, if, they, pulled, on, one, of, these, weapons, the, butt, end, disturbed, a, bowl, underneath, and, a, slow, burning, incandescent, material, in, the, bowl, ignited, the, fuses, at, augsburg, in, 1573, three, centuries, after, the, chinese, invented, the, first, pressure, operated, mine, a, german, military, engineer, by, the, name, of, samuel, zimmermann, invented, the, fladdermine, flying, mine, it, consisted, of, a, few, pounds, of, black, powder, buried, near, the, surface, and, was, activated, by, stepping, on, it, or, tripping, a, wire, that, made, a, flintlock, fire, such, mines, were, deployed, on, the, slope, in, front, of, a, fort, they, were, used, during, the, franco, prussian, war, but, were, probably, not, very, effective, because, a, flintlock, does, not, work, for, long, when, left, untended, another, device, the, fougasse, was, not, victim, operated, or, mass, produced, but, it, was, a, precursor, of, modern, fragmentation, mines, and, the, claymore, mine, it, consisted, of, a, cone, shape, hole, with, gunpowder, at, the, bottom, covered, either, by, rocks, and, scrap, iron, stone, fougasse, or, mortar, shells, similar, to, large, black, powder, hand, grenades, shell, fougasse, it, was, triggered, by, a, flintlock, connected, to, a, tripwire, on, the, surface, it, could, sometimes, cause, heavy, casualties, but, required, high, maintenance, due, to, the, susceptibility, of, black, powder, to, dampness, consequently, it, was, mainly, employed, in, the, defenses, of, major, fortifications, in, which, role, it, used, in, several, european, wars, of, the, eighteenth, century, and, the, american, revolution, one, of, the, greatest, limitations, of, early, land, mines, was, the, unreliable, fuses, and, their, susceptibility, to, dampness, this, changed, with, the, invention, of, the, safety, fuse, later, command, initiation, the, ability, to, detonate, a, charge, immediately, instead, of, waiting, several, minutes, for, a, fuse, to, burn, became, possible, after, electricity, was, developed, an, electric, current, sent, down, a, wire, could, ignite, the, charge, with, a, spark, the, russians, claim, first, use, of, this, technology, in, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1828, 1829, and, with, it, the, fougasse, remained, useful, until, it, was, superseded, by, the, claymore, in, the, 1960s, victim, activated, mines, were, also, unreliable, because, they, relied, on, a, flintlock, to, ignite, the, explosive, the, percussion, cap, developed, in, the, early, 19th, century, made, them, much, more, reliable, and, pressure, operated, mines, were, deployed, on, land, and, sea, in, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, during, the, american, civil, war, the, confederate, brigadier, general, gabriel, j, rains, deployed, thousands, of, torpedoes, consisting, of, artillery, shells, with, pressure, caps, beginning, with, the, battle, of, yorktown, in, 1862, as, a, captain, rains, had, earlier, employed, explosive, booby, traps, during, the, seminole, wars, in, florida, in, 1840, over, the, course, of, the, war, mines, only, caused, a, few, hundred, casualties, but, they, had, a, large, effect, on, morale, and, slowed, down, the, advance, of, union, troops, many, on, both, sides, considered, the, use, of, mines, barbaric, and, in, response, generals, in, the, union, army, forced, confederate, prisoners, to, remove, the, mines, starting, in, the, 19th, century, more, powerful, explosives, than, gunpowder, were, developed, often, for, non, military, reasons, such, as, blasting, train, tunnels, in, the, alps, and, rockies, guncotton, up, to, four, times, more, powerful, than, gunpowder, was, invented, by, christian, schonbein, in, 1846, it, was, dangerous, to, make, until, frederick, augustus, abel, developed, a, safe, method, in, 1865, from, the, 1870s, to, the, first, world, war, it, was, the, standard, explosive, used, by, the, british, military, in, 1847, ascanio, sobrero, invented, nitroglycerine, to, treat, angina, pectoris, and, it, turned, out, to, be, a, much, more, powerful, explosive, than, guncotton, it, was, very, dangerous, to, use, until, alfred, nobel, found, a, way, to, incorporate, it, in, a, solid, mixture, called, dynamite, and, developed, a, safe, detonator, even, then, dynamite, needed, to, be, stored, carefully, or, it, could, form, crystals, that, detonated, easily, thus, the, military, still, preferred, guncotton, in, 1863, the, german, chemical, industry, developed, trinitrotoluene, tnt, this, had, the, advantage, that, it, was, difficult, to, detonate, so, it, could, withstand, the, shock, of, firing, by, artillery, pieces, it, was, also, advantageous, for, land, mines, for, several, reasons, it, was, not, detonated, by, the, shock, of, shells, landing, nearby, it, was, lightweight, unaffected, by, damp, and, stable, under, a, wide, range, of, conditions, it, could, be, melted, to, fill, a, container, of, any, shape, and, it, was, cheap, to, make, thus, it, became, the, standard, explosive, in, mines, after, the, first, world, war, the, british, used, mines, in, the, siege, of, khartoum, a, sudanese, mahdist, force, much, larger, than, british, strength, was, held, off, for, ten, months, but, the, town, was, ultimately, taken, and, the, british, massacred, in, the, boer, war, 1899, 1903, they, succeeded, in, holding, mafeking, against, boer, forces, with, the, help, of, a, mixture, of, real, and, fake, minefields, and, they, laid, mines, alongside, railroad, tracks, to, discourage, sabotage, in, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, both, sides, used, land, and, sea, mines, although, the, effect, on, land, mainly, affected, morale, the, naval, mines, were, far, more, effective, destroying, several, battleships, one, sign, of, the, increasing, power, of, explosives, used, in, land, mines, was, that, by, the, first, world, war, they, burst, into, about, 1, 000, high, velocity, fragments, in, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, it, had, only, been, 20, to, 30, fragments, nevertheless, antipersonnel, mines, were, not, a, big, factor, in, the, war, because, machine, guns, barbed, wire, and, rapid, fire, artillery, were, far, more, effective, defenses, an, exception, was, in, africa, now, tanzania, and, namibia, where, the, warfare, was, much, more, mobile, towards, the, end, of, the, war, the, british, started, to, use, tanks, to, break, through, trench, defenses, the, germans, responded, with, anti, tank, guns, and, mines, improvised, mines, gave, way, to, mass, produced, mines, consisting, of, wooden, boxes, filled, with, guncotton, and, minefields, were, standardized, to, stop, masses, of, tanks, from, advancing, between, world, wars, the, future, allies, did, little, work, on, land, mines, but, the, germans, developed, a, series, of, anti, tank, mines, the, tellermines, plate, mines, they, also, developed, the, schrapnell, mine, also, known, as, the, s, mine, the, first, bounding, mine, when, triggered, this, jumped, up, to, about, waist, height, and, exploded, sending, thousands, of, steel, balls, in, all, directions, triggered, by, pressure, trip, wires, or, electronics, it, could, harm, soldiers, within, an, area, of, about, 2, 800, square, feet, tens, of, millions, of, mines, were, laid, in, the, second, world, war, particularly, in, the, deserts, of, north, africa, and, the, steppes, of, eastern, europe, where, the, open, ground, favored, tanks, however, the, first, country, to, use, them, was, finland, they, were, defending, against, a, much, larger, soviet, force, with, over, 6, 000, tanks, twenty, times, the, number, the, finns, had, but, they, had, terrain, that, was, broken, up, by, lakes, and, forests, so, tank, movement, was, restricted, to, roads, and, tracks, their, defensive, line, the, mannerheim, line, integrated, these, natural, defenses, with, mines, including, simple, fragmentation, mines, mounted, on, stakes, while, the, germans, were, advancing, rapidly, using, blitzkrieg, tactics, they, did, not, make, much, use, of, mines, after, 1942, however, they, were, on, the, defensive, and, became, the, most, inventive, and, systematic, users, of, mines, their, production, shot, up, and, they, began, inventing, new, types, of, mines, as, the, allies, found, ways, to, counter, the, existing, ones, to, make, it, more, difficult, to, remove, antitank, mines, they, surrounded, them, with, s, mines, and, added, anti, handling, devices, that, would, explode, when, soldiers, tried, to, lift, them, they, also, took, a, formal, approach, to, laying, mines, and, they, kept, detailed, records, of, the, locations, of, mines, in, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, in, 1942, the, germans, prepared, for, an, allied, attack, by, laying, about, half, a, million, mines, in, two, fields, running, across, the, entire, battlefield, and, five, miles, deep, nicknamed, the, devil, s, gardens, they, were, covered, by, 88, mm, anti, tank, guns, and, small, arms, fire, the, allies, prevailed, but, at, the, cost, of, over, half, their, tanks, 20, percent, of, the, losses, were, caused, by, mines, the, soviets, learned, the, value, of, mines, from, their, war, with, finland, and, when, germany, invaded, they, made, heavy, use, of, them, manufacturing, over, 67, million, at, the, battle, of, kursk, which, put, an, end, to, the, german, advance, they, laid, over, a, million, mines, in, eight, belts, with, an, overall, depth, of, 35, kilometres, mines, forced, tanks, to, slow, down, and, wait, for, soldiers, to, go, ahead, and, remove, the, mines, the, main, method, of, breaching, minefields, involved, prodding, the, dirt, with, a, bayonet, or, stick, at, an, angle, of, 30, degrees, to, avoid, putting, pressure, on, the, top, of, the, mine, and, detonating, it, since, all, mines, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, had, metal, casings, metal, detectors, could, be, used, to, speed, up, the, locating, of, mines, a, polish, officer, j, zef, kosacki, developed, a, portable, mine, detector, known, as, the, polish, mine, detector, to, counter, the, detector, germans, developed, mines, with, wooden, casings, the, schu, mine, 42, antipersonnel, and, holzmine, 42, anti, tank, effective, cheap, and, easy, to, make, the, schu, mine, became, the, most, common, mine, in, the, war, mine, casings, were, also, made, of, glass, concrete, and, clay, the, russians, developed, a, mine, with, a, pressed, cardboard, casing, the, pmk40, and, the, italians, made, an, anti, tank, mine, out, of, bakelite, in, 1944, the, germans, created, the, topfmine, an, entirely, non, metallic, mine, they, ensured, that, they, could, detect, their, own, mines, by, covering, them, with, radioactive, sand, the, allies, did, not, find, this, out, until, after, the, war, several, mechanical, methods, for, clearing, mines, were, tried, heavy, rollers, were, attached, to, tanks, or, cargo, trucks, but, they, did, not, last, long, and, their, weight, made, the, tanks, considerably, slower, tanks, and, bulldozers, pushed, ploughs, that, pushed, aside, any, mines, to, a, depth, of, 30, cm, the, bangalore, torpedo, a, long, thin, tube, filled, with, explosives, was, invented, in, 1912, and, used, to, clear, barbed, wire, larger, versions, such, as, the, snake, and, the, conger, were, developed, for, clearing, mines, but, were, not, very, effective, one, of, the, best, options, was, the, flail, which, had, weights, attached, by, chains, to, rotating, drums, the, first, version, the, scorpion, was, attached, to, the, matilda, tank, and, used, in, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, the, crab, attached, to, the, sherman, tank, was, faster, at, 2, kilometers, per, hour, it, was, used, during, d, day, and, the, aftermath, during, the, cold, war, the, members, of, nato, were, concerned, about, massive, armored, attacks, by, the, soviet, union, they, planned, for, a, minefield, stretching, across, the, entire, west, german, border, and, developed, new, types, of, mines, the, british, designed, an, anti, tank, mine, the, mark, 7, to, defeat, rollers, by, detonating, the, second, time, it, was, pressed, it, also, had, a, 0, 7, second, delay, so, the, tank, would, be, directly, over, the, mine, they, also, developed, the, first, scatterable, mine, the, no, 7, dingbat, the, americans, used, the, m6, antitank, mine, and, tripwire, operated, bounding, antipersonnel, mines, such, as, the, m2, and, m16, in, the, korean, war, land, mine, use, was, dictated, by, the, steep, terrain, narrow, valleys, forest, cover, and, lack, of, developed, roads, this, made, tanks, less, effective, and, more, easily, stopped, by, mines, however, mines, laid, near, roads, were, often, easy, to, spot, in, response, to, this, problem, the, us, developed, the, m24, a, mine, that, was, placed, off, to, the, side, of, the, road, when, triggered, by, a, tripwire, it, fired, a, rocket, however, the, mine, was, not, available, until, after, the, war, the, chinese, had, a, lot, of, success, with, massed, infantry, attacks, the, extensive, forest, cover, limited, the, range, of, machine, guns, but, anti, personnel, mines, were, effective, however, mines, were, poorly, recorded, and, marked, often, becoming, as, much, a, hazard, to, allies, as, enemies, tripwire, operated, mines, were, not, defended, by, pressure, mines, the, chinese, were, often, able, to, disable, them, and, reuse, them, against, un, forces, looking, for, more, destructive, mines, the, americans, developed, the, claymore, a, directional, fragmentation, mine, that, hurls, steel, balls, in, a, 60, degree, arc, at, a, lethal, speed, of, 1, 200, metres, per, second, they, also, developed, a, pressure, operated, mine, the, m14, toe, popper, these, too, were, ready, too, late, for, the, korean, war, in, 1948, the, british, developed, the, no, 6, antipersonnel, mine, a, minimum, metal, mine, with, a, narrow, diameter, making, it, difficult, to, detect, with, metal, detectors, or, prodding, its, three, pronged, pressure, piece, inspired, the, nickname, carrot, mine, however, it, was, unreliable, in, wet, conditions, in, the, 1960s, the, canadians, developed, a, similar, but, more, reliable, mine, the, c3a1, elsie, and, the, british, army, adopted, it, the, british, also, developed, the, l9, bar, mine, a, wide, anti, tank, mine, with, a, rectangular, shape, which, covered, more, area, allowing, a, minefield, to, be, laid, four, times, as, fast, as, previous, mines, they, also, upgraded, the, dingbat, to, the, ranger, a, plastic, mine, that, was, fired, from, a, truck, mounted, discharger, that, could, fire, 72, mines, at, a, time, in, the, 1950s, the, us, operation, doan, brook, studied, the, feasibility, of, delivering, mines, by, air, this, led, to, three, types, of, air, delivered, mine, wide, area, anti, personnel, mines, waapms, were, small, steel, spheres, that, discharged, tripwires, when, they, hit, the, ground, each, dispenser, held, 540, mines, the, blu, 43, dragontooth, was, small, and, had, a, flattened, w, shape, to, slow, its, descent, while, the, gravel, mine, was, larger, both, were, packed, by, the, thousand, into, bombs, all, three, were, designed, to, inactivate, after, a, period, of, time, but, any, that, failed, to, activate, presented, a, safety, challenge, over, 37, million, gravel, mines, were, produced, between, 1967, and, 1968, and, when, they, were, dropped, in, places, like, vietnam, their, locations, were, unmarked, and, unrecorded, a, similar, problem, was, presented, by, unexploded, cluster, munitions, the, next, generation, of, scatterable, mines, arose, in, response, to, the, increasing, mobility, of, war, the, germans, developed, the, skorpion, system, which, scattered, at2, mines, from, a, tracked, vehicle, the, italians, developed, a, helicopter, delivery, system, that, could, rapidly, switch, between, sb, 33, anti, personnel, mines, and, sb, 81, anti, tank, mines, the, us, developed, a, range, of, systems, called, the, family, of, scatterable, mines, fascam, that, could, deliver, mines, by, fast, jet, artillery, helicopter, and, ground, launcher, the, iraq, iran, war, the, gulf, war, and, the, islamic, state, have, all, contributed, to, land, mine, saturation, in, iraq, from, the, 1980s, through, 2020, in, 2019, iraq, was, the, most, saturated, country, in, the, world, with, land, mines, countries, that, provided, land, mines, during, the, iran, iraq, war, included, belgium, canada, chile, china, egypt, france, italy, romania, singapore, the, former, soviet, union, and, the, u, s, and, were, concentrated, in, the, kurdish, areas, in, the, northern, area, of, iraq, during, the, gulf, war, the, u, s, deployed, 117, 634, mines, with, 27, 967, being, anti, personnel, mines, and, 89, 667, being, anti, vehicle, mines, the, u, s, did, not, use, land, mines, during, the, iraq, war, landmines, and, other, unexploded, battlefield, ordnances, contaminate, at, least, 724, million, square, meters, of, land, in, afghanistan, only, two, of, afghanistan, s, twenty, nine, provinces, are, believed, to, be, free, of, landmines, the, most, heavily, mined, provinces, are, herat, and, kandahar, since, 1989, nearly, 44, 000, afghan, civilians, have, been, recorded, to, have, been, killed, or, injured, by, landmines, and, explosive, remnants, of, war, erw, averaging, to, around, 110, people, per, month, improvised, mines, im, and, erw, from, armed, clashes, caused, nearly, 99, percent, of, the, casualties, recorded, in, 2021, during, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, both, russian, and, ukrainian, forces, have, used, land, mines, ukrainian, officials, claim, russian, forces, planted, thousands, of, land, mines, or, other, explosive, devices, during, their, withdrawal, from, ukrainian, cities, including, in, civilian, areas, russian, forces, have, also, utilized, remotely, delivered, anti, personnel, mines, such, as, the, pom, 3, in, the, first, world, war, the, germans, developed, a, device, nicknamed, the, yperite, mine, by, the, british, that, they, left, behind, in, abandoned, trenches, and, bunkers, it, was, detonated, by, a, delayed, charge, spreading, mustard, gas, yperite, in, the, second, world, war, they, developed, a, modern, chemical, mine, the, spr, h, b, chse, 37, bounding, gas, mine, 37, but, never, used, it, the, united, states, developed, the, m1, chemical, mine, which, used, mustard, gas, in, 1939, and, the, m23, chemical, mine, which, used, the, vx, nerve, agent, in, 1960, the, soviets, developed, the, khf, a, bounding, chemical, mine, the, french, had, chemical, mines, and, the, iraqis, were, believed, to, have, them, before, the, invasion, of, kuwait, in, 1997, the, chemical, weapons, convention, came, into, force, prohibiting, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, mandating, their, destruction, by, july, 2023, all, declared, stockpiles, of, chemical, weapons, were, destroyed, for, a, few, decades, during, the, cold, war, the, u, s, developed, atomic, demolition, munitions, often, referred, to, as, nuclear, land, mines, these, were, portable, nuclear, bombs, that, could, be, placed, by, hand, and, could, be, detonated, remotely, or, with, a, timer, some, of, these, were, deployed, in, europe, governments, in, west, germany, turkey, and, greece, wanted, to, have, nuclear, minefields, as, a, defense, against, attack, from, the, warsaw, pact, however, such, weapons, were, politically, and, tactically, infeasible, and, by, 1989, the, last, of, these, munitions, was, retired, the, british, also, had, a, project, codenamed, blue, peacock, to, develop, nuclear, mines, to, be, buried, in, germany, the, project, was, cancelled, in, 1958, a, conventional, land, mine, consists, of, a, casing, that, is, mostly, filled, with, the, main, charge, it, has, a, firing, mechanism, such, as, a, pressure, plate, this, triggers, a, detonator, or, igniter, which, in, turn, sets, off, a, booster, charge, there, may, be, additional, firing, mechanisms, in, anti, handling, devices, a, land, mine, can, be, triggered, by, a, number, of, things, including, pressure, movement, sound, magnetism, and, vibration, anti, personnel, mines, commonly, use, the, pressure, of, a, person, s, foot, as, a, trigger, but, tripwires, are, also, frequently, employed, most, modern, anti, vehicle, mines, use, a, magnetic, trigger, to, enable, it, to, detonate, even, if, the, tires, or, tracks, did, not, touch, it, advanced, mines, are, able, to, sense, the, difference, between, friendly, and, enemy, types, of, vehicles, by, way, of, a, built, in, signature, catalog, this, will, theoretically, enable, friendly, forces, to, use, the, mined, area, while, denying, the, enemy, access, many, mines, combine, the, main, trigger, with, a, touch, or, tilt, trigger, to, prevent, enemy, engineers, from, defusing, it, land, mine, designs, tend, to, use, as, little, metal, as, possible, to, make, searching, with, a, metal, detector, more, difficult, land, mines, made, mostly, of, plastic, have, the, added, advantage, of, being, very, inexpensive, some, types, of, modern, mines, are, designed, to, self, destruct, or, chemically, render, themselves, inert, after, a, period, of, weeks, or, months, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, civilian, casualties, at, the, conflict, s, end, these, self, destruct, mechanisms, are, not, absolutely, reliable, and, most, land, mines, laid, historically, are, not, equipped, in, this, manner, there, is, a, common, misperception, that, a, landmine, is, armed, by, stepping, on, it, and, only, triggered, by, stepping, off, providing, tension, in, movies, in, fact, the, initial, pressure, trigger, will, detonate, the, mine, as, they, are, designed, to, kill, or, maim, not, to, make, someone, stand, very, still, until, it, can, be, disarmed, there, are, mines, that, are, armed, by, stepping, on, them, and, exploding, after, you, step, off, the, ms3, is, a, pressure, release, mine, or, booby, trap, similar, in, appearance, to, the, pmn, anti, personnel, mine, it, has, been, found, in, afghanistan, tajikistan, and, ukraine, anti, handling, devices, detonate, the, mine, if, someone, attempts, to, lift, shift, or, disarm, it, the, intention, is, to, hinder, deminers, by, discouraging, any, attempts, to, clear, minefields, there, is, a, degree, of, overlap, between, the, function, of, a, boobytrap, and, an, anti, handling, device, insofar, as, some, mines, have, optional, fuze, pockets, into, which, standard, pull, or, pressure, release, boobytrap, firing, devices, can, be, screwed, alternatively, some, mines, may, mimic, a, standard, design, but, actually, be, specifically, intended, to, kill, deminers, such, as, the, mc, 3, and, pmn, 3, variants, of, the, pmn, mine, anti, handling, devices, can, be, found, on, both, anti, personnel, mines, and, anti, tank, mines, either, as, an, integral, part, of, their, design, or, as, improvised, add, ons, for, this, reason, the, standard, render, safe, procedure, for, mines, is, often, to, destroy, them, on, site, without, attempting, to, lift, them, smart, mines, utilize, a, number, of, advanced, technologies, developed, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, most, commonly, this, includes, mechanisms, to, deactivate, or, self, destruct, the, mine, after, a, preset, period, of, time, this, is, intended, to, reduce, civilian, casualties, and, simplify, demining, other, innovations, include, self, healing, minefields, which, detect, gaps, in, the, field, and, can, direct, the, mines, to, rearrange, their, positions, and, eliminate, it, anti, tank, mines, were, created, not, long, after, the, invention, of, the, tank, in, the, first, world, war, at, first, improvised, purpose, built, designs, were, developed, set, off, when, a, tank, passes, they, attack, the, tank, at, one, of, its, weaker, areas, the, tracks, they, are, designed, to, immobilize, or, destroy, vehicles, and, their, occupants, in, u, s, military, terminology, destroying, the, vehicles, is, referred, to, as, a, catastrophic, kill, while, only, disabling, its, movement, is, referred, to, as, a, mobility, kill, anti, tank, mines, are, typically, larger, than, anti, personnel, mines, and, require, more, pressure, to, detonate, the, high, trigger, pressure, normally, requiring, 100, kilograms, 220, lb, prevents, them, from, being, set, off, by, infantry, or, smaller, vehicles, of, lesser, importance, more, modern, anti, tank, mines, use, shaped, charges, to, focus, and, increase, the, armor, penetration, of, the, explosives, anti, personnel, mines, are, designed, primarily, to, kill, or, injure, people, as, opposed, to, vehicles, they, are, often, designed, to, injure, rather, than, kill, to, increase, the, logistical, support, evacuation, medical, burden, on, the, opposing, force, some, types, of, anti, personnel, mines, can, also, damage, the, tracks, or, wheels, of, armored, vehicles, in, the, asymmetric, warfare, conflicts, and, civil, wars, of, the, 21st, century, improvised, explosives, known, as, ieds, have, partially, supplanted, conventional, land, mines, as, the, source, of, injury, to, dismounted, pedestrian, soldiers, and, civilians, ieds, are, used, mainly, by, insurgents, and, terrorists, against, regular, armed, forces, and, civilians, the, injuries, from, the, anti, personnel, ied, were, recently, reported, in, bmj, open, to, be, far, worse, than, with, landmines, resulting, in, multiple, limb, amputations, and, lower, body, mutilation, land, mines, were, designed, for, two, main, uses, land, mines, are, currently, used, in, large, quantities, mostly, for, this, first, purpose, thus, their, widespread, use, in, the, demilitarized, zones, dmzs, of, likely, flashpoints, such, as, cyprus, afghanistan, and, korea, syria, has, used, land, mines, in, its, civil, war, since, 2021, land, mine, use, has, risen, in, myanmar, during, its, internal, conflict, as, of, 2023, both, russia, and, ukraine, have, deployed, land, mines, in, military, science, minefields, are, considered, a, defensive, or, harassing, weapon, used, to, slow, the, enemy, down, to, help, deny, certain, terrain, to, the, enemy, to, focus, enemy, movement, into, kill, zones, or, to, reduce, morale, by, randomly, attacking, material, and, personnel, in, some, engagements, during, world, war, ii, anti, tank, mines, accounted, for, half, of, all, vehicles, disabled, since, combat, engineers, with, mine, clearing, equipment, can, clear, a, path, through, a, minefield, relatively, quickly, mines, are, usually, considered, effective, only, if, covered, by, fire, the, extents, of, minefields, are, often, marked, with, warning, signs, and, cloth, tape, to, prevent, friendly, troops, and, non, combatants, from, entering, them, of, course, sometimes, terrain, can, be, denied, using, dummy, minefields, most, forces, carefully, record, the, location, and, disposition, of, their, own, minefields, because, warning, signs, can, be, destroyed, or, removed, and, minefields, should, eventually, be, cleared, minefields, may, also, have, marked, or, unmarked, safe, routes, to, allow, friendly, movement, through, them, placing, minefields, without, marking, and, recording, them, for, later, removal, is, considered, a, war, crime, under, protocol, ii, of, the, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, which, is, itself, an, annex, to, the, geneva, conventions, artillery, and, aircraft, scatterable, mines, allow, minefields, to, be, placed, in, front, of, moving, formations, of, enemy, units, including, the, reinforcement, of, minefields, or, other, obstacles, that, have, been, breached, by, enemy, engineers, they, can, also, be, used, to, cover, the, retreat, of, forces, disengaging, from, the, enemy, or, for, interdiction, of, supporting, units, to, isolate, front, line, units, from, resupply, in, most, cases, these, minefields, consist, of, a, combination, of, anti, tank, and, anti, personnel, mines, with, the, anti, personnel, mines, making, removal, of, the, anti, tank, mines, more, difficult, mines, of, this, type, used, by, the, united, states, are, designed, to, self, destruct, after, a, preset, period, of, time, reducing, the, requirement, for, mine, clearing, to, only, those, mines, whose, self, destruct, system, did, not, function, some, designs, of, these, scatterable, mines, require, an, electrical, charge, capacitor, or, battery, to, detonate, after, a, certain, period, of, time, either, the, charge, dissipates, leaving, them, effectively, inert, or, the, circuitry, is, designed, such, that, upon, reaching, a, low, level, the, device, is, triggered, thus, destroying, the, mine, none, of, the, conventional, tactics, and, norms, of, mine, warfare, applies, when, they, are, employed, in, a, guerrilla, role, land, mines, were, commonly, deployed, by, insurgents, during, the, south, african, border, war, leading, directly, to, the, development, of, the, first, dedicated, mine, protected, armoured, vehicles, in, south, africa, namibian, insurgents, used, anti, tank, mines, to, throw, south, african, military, convoys, into, disarray, before, attacking, them, to, discourage, detection, and, removal, efforts, they, also, laid, anti, personnel, mines, directly, parallel, to, the, anti, tank, mines, this, initially, resulted, in, heavy, south, african, military, and, police, casualties, as, the, vast, distances, of, road, network, vulnerable, to, insurgent, sappers, every, day, made, comprehensive, detection, and, clearance, efforts, impractical, the, only, other, viable, option, was, the, adoption, of, mine, protected, vehicles, which, could, remain, mobile, on, the, roads, with, little, risk, to, their, passengers, even, if, a, mine, was, detonated, south, africa, is, widely, credited, with, inventing, the, v, hull, a, vee, shaped, hull, for, armoured, vehicles, which, deflects, mine, blasts, away, from, the, passenger, compartment, during, the, ongoing, syrian, civil, war, iraqi, civil, war, 2014, 2017, and, yemeni, civil, war, 2015, present, land, mines, have, been, used, for, both, defensive, and, guerrilla, purposes, minefields, may, be, laid, by, several, means, the, preferred, but, most, labour, intensive, way, is, to, have, engineers, bury, the, mines, since, this, will, make, the, mines, practically, invisible, and, reduce, the, number, of, mines, needed, to, deny, the, enemy, an, area, mines, can, be, laid, by, specialized, mine, laying, vehicles, mine, scattering, shells, may, be, fired, by, artillery, from, a, distance, of, several, tens, of, kilometers, mines, may, be, dropped, from, helicopters, or, airplanes, or, ejected, from, cluster, bombs, or, cruise, missiles, anti, tank, minefields, can, be, scattered, with, anti, personnel, mines, to, make, clearing, them, manually, more, time, consuming, and, anti, personnel, minefields, are, scattered, with, anti, tank, mines, to, prevent, the, use, of, armored, vehicles, to, clear, them, quickly, some, anti, tank, mine, types, are, also, able, to, be, triggered, by, infantry, giving, them, a, dual, purpose, even, though, their, main, and, official, intention, is, to, work, as, anti, tank, weapons, some, minefields, are, specifically, booby, trapped, to, make, clearing, them, more, dangerous, mixed, anti, personnel, and, anti, tank, minefields, anti, personnel, mines, under, anti, tank, mines, and, fuses, separated, from, mines, have, all, been, used, for, this, purpose, often, single, mines, are, backed, by, a, secondary, device, designed, to, kill, or, maim, personnel, tasked, with, clearing, the, mine, multiple, anti, tank, mines, have, been, buried, in, stacks, of, two, or, three, with, the, bottom, mine, fuzed, to, multiply, the, penetrating, power, since, the, mines, are, buried, the, ground, directs, the, energy, of, the, blast, in, a, single, direction, through, the, bottom, of, the, target, vehicle, or, on, the, track, another, specific, use, is, to, mine, an, aircraft, runway, immediately, after, it, has, been, bombed, to, delay, or, discourage, repair, some, cluster, bombs, combine, these, functions, one, example, was, the, british, jp233, cluster, bomb, which, includes, munitions, to, damage, crater, the, runway, as, well, as, anti, personnel, mines, in, the, same, cluster, bomb, as, a, result, of, the, anti, personnel, mine, ban, it, was, withdrawn, from, british, royal, air, force, service, and, the, last, stockpiles, of, the, mine, were, destroyed, on, october, 19, 1999, metal, detectors, were, first, used, for, demining, after, their, invention, by, the, polish, officer, j, zef, kosacki, his, invention, known, as, the, polish, mine, detector, was, used, by, the, allies, alongside, mechanical, methods, to, clear, the, german, mine, fields, during, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, when, 500, units, were, shipped, to, field, marshal, montgomery, s, eighth, army, the, nazis, used, captured, civilians, who, were, chased, across, minefields, to, detonate, the, explosives, according, to, laurence, rees, curt, von, gottberg, the, ss, obergruppenf, hrer, who, during, 1943, conducted, another, huge, anti, partisan, action, called, operation, kottbus, on, the, eastern, border, of, belarus, reported, that, approximately, two, to, three, thousand, local, people, were, blown, up, in, the, clearing, of, the, minefields, whereas, the, placing, and, arming, of, mines, is, relatively, inexpensive, and, simple, the, process, of, detecting, and, removing, them, is, typically, expensive, slow, and, dangerous, this, is, especially, true, of, irregular, warfare, where, mines, were, used, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, in, unmarked, and, undocumented, areas, anti, personnel, mines, are, most, difficult, to, find, due, to, their, small, size, and, many, being, made, almost, entirely, of, non, metallic, materials, specifically, to, evade, metal, detectors, manual, clearing, remains, the, most, effective, technique, for, clearing, mine, fields, although, hybrid, techniques, involving, the, use, of, animals, and, robots, are, being, developed, many, animals, are, desirable, due, to, having, a, strong, sense, of, smell, capable, of, detecting, a, land, mine, animals, such, as, rats, and, dogs, can, be, trained, to, detect, the, explosive, agent, other, techniques, involve, the, use, of, geolocation, technologies, as, of, 2008, a, joint, team, of, researchers, at, the, university, of, new, south, wales, and, ohio, state, university, was, working, to, develop, a, system, based, on, multi, sensor, integration, furthermore, defence, firms, have, been, increasingly, competing, on, the, creation, of, unmanned, demining, systems, in, addition, to, conventional, remote, control, mine, defusing, robots, that, operate, either, through, precise, mechanical, dismantling, electronic, destabilization, and, kinetic, triggering, methods, fully, autonomous, methods, are, in, development, notably, these, autonomous, methods, utilize, unmanned, ground, systems, or, more, recently, subterranean, systems, such, as, the, emc, operations, termite, using, either, outward, pressure, differentials, along, system, bodies, or, corkscrew, mechanisms, the, laying, of, land, mines, has, inadvertently, led, to, a, positive, development, in, the, falkland, islands, minefields, laid, near, the, sea, during, the, falklands, war, have, become, favorite, places, for, penguins, which, do, not, weigh, enough, to, detonate, the, mines, therefore, they, can, breed, safely, free, of, human, intrusion, these, odd, sanctuaries, have, proven, so, popular, and, lucrative, for, ecotourism, that, efforts, existed, to, prevent, removal, of, the, mines, but, the, area, has, since, been, demined, the, use, of, land, mines, is, controversial, because, they, are, indiscriminate, weapons, harming, soldier, and, civilian, alike, they, remain, dangerous, after, the, conflict, in, which, they, were, deployed, has, ended, killing, and, injuring, civilians, and, rendering, land, impassable, and, unusable, for, decades, to, make, matters, worse, many, factions, have, not, kept, accurate, records, or, any, at, all, of, the, exact, locations, of, their, minefields, making, removal, efforts, painstakingly, slow, these, facts, pose, serious, difficulties, in, many, developing, nations, where, the, presence, of, mines, hampers, resettlement, agriculture, and, tourism, the, international, campaign, to, ban, landmines, campaigned, successfully, to, prohibit, their, use, culminating, in, the, 1997, convention, on, the, prohibition, of, the, use, stockpiling, production, and, transfer, of, anti, personnel, mines, and, on, their, destruction, known, informally, as, the, ottawa, treaty, the, treaty, came, into, force, on, march, 1, 1999, the, treaty, was, the, result, of, the, leadership, of, the, governments, of, canada, norway, south, africa, and, mozambique, working, with, the, international, campaign, to, ban, landmines, launched, in, 1992, the, campaign, and, its, leader, jody, williams, won, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1997, for, its, efforts, the, treaty, does, not, include, anti, tank, mines, cluster, bombs, or, claymore, type, mines, operated, in, command, mode, and, focuses, specifically, on, anti, personnel, mines, because, these, pose, the, greatest, long, term, post, conflict, risk, to, humans, and, animals, since, they, are, typically, designed, to, be, triggered, by, any, movement, or, pressure, of, only, a, few, kilograms, whereas, anti, tank, mines, require, much, more, weight, or, a, combination, of, factors, that, would, exclude, humans, existing, stocks, must, be, destroyed, within, four, years, of, signing, the, treaty, signatories, of, the, ottawa, treaty, agree, that, they, will, not, use, produce, stockpile, or, trade, in, anti, personnel, land, mines, in, 1997, there, were, 122, signatories, as, of, early, 2016, 162, countries, have, joined, the, treaty, thirty, six, countries, including, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, russian, federation, and, the, united, states, which, together, may, hold, tens, of, millions, of, stockpiled, antipersonnel, mines, are, not, party, to, the, convention, another, 34, have, yet, to, sign, on, the, united, states, did, not, sign, because, the, treaty, lacks, an, exception, for, the, korean, demilitarized, zone, there, is, a, clause, in, the, treaty, article, 3, which, permits, countries, to, retain, land, mines, for, use, in, training, or, development, of, countermeasures, sixty, four, countries, have, taken, this, option, as, an, alternative, to, an, outright, ban, 10, countries, follow, regulations, that, are, contained, in, a, 1996, amendment, of, protocol, ii, of, the, convention, on, conventional, weapons, ccw, the, countries, are, china, finland, india, israel, morocco, pakistan, south, korea, and, the, united, states, sri, lanka, which, had, adhered, to, this, regulation, announced, in, 2016, that, it, would, join, the, ottawa, treaty, submunitions, and, unexploded, ordnance, from, cluster, munitions, can, also, function, as, land, mines, in, that, they, continue, to, kill, and, maim, indiscriminately, long, after, conflicts, have, ended, the, convention, on, cluster, munitions, ccm, is, an, international, treaty, that, prohibits, the, use, distribution, or, manufacture, of, cluster, munitions, the, ccm, entered, into, force, in, 2010, and, has, been, ratified, by, over, 100, countries, before, the, ottawa, treaty, was, adopted, the, arms, project, of, human, rights, watch, identified, almost, 100, companies, and, government, agencies, in, 48, countries, that, had, manufactured, more, than, 340, types, of, antipersonnel, land, mines, in, recent, decades, five, to, ten, million, mines, were, produced, per, year, with, a, value, of, 50, to, 200, million, the, largest, producers, were, probably, china, italy, and, the, soviet, union, the, companies, involved, included, giants, such, as, daimler, benz, the, fiat, group, the, daewoo, group, rca, and, general, electric, as, of, 2017, the, landmine, cluster, munition, monitor, identified, four, countries, that, were, likely, to, be, actively, producing, land, mines, india, myanmar, pakistan, and, south, korea, another, seven, states, reserved, the, right, to, make, them, but, were, probably, not, doing, so, china, cuba, iran, north, korea, russia, singapore, and, vietnam, in, recent, years, arms, industry, manufacturers, have, been, utilizing, non, static, mines, that, can, be, specifically, targeted, in, order, to, remove, the, imprecision, of, antipersonnel, devices, promoting, the, use, of, movable, underground, systems, movable, above, ground, systems, and, systems, that, can, be, expired, automatically, or, manually, via, strategic, operators, development, of, systems, such, as, termite, by, arms, firm, emc, operations, has, led, to, criticism, from, proponents, of, past, multilateral, agreements, against, the, placement, of, land, mines, and, submunitions, due, to, expectations, of, similar, long, dormancy, period, issues, after, systems, break, or, fail, after, it, was, announced, that, vehicles, would, likely, be, armed, to, destroy, static, targets, rather, than, focus, purely, on, demining, efforts, throughout, the, world, there, are, millions, of, hectares, that, are, contaminated, with, land, mines, from, 1999, to, 2017, the, landmine, monitor, has, recorded, over, 120, 000, casualties, from, mines, ieds, and, explosive, remnants, of, war, it, estimates, that, another, 1, 000, per, year, go, unrecorded, the, estimate, for, all, time, is, over, half, a, million, in, 2017, at, least, 2, 793, were, killed, and, 4, 431, injured, 87, of, the, casualties, were, civilians, and, 47, were, children, less, than, 18, years, old, the, largest, numbers, of, casualties, were, in, afghanistan, 2, 300, syria, 1, 906, and, ukraine, 429, natural, disasters, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, efforts, to, demine, areas, of, land, for, example, the, floods, that, occurred, in, mozambique, in, 1999, and, 2000, may, have, displaced, hundreds, of, thousands, of, land, mines, left, from, the, war, uncertainty, about, their, locations, delayed, recovery, efforts, from, a, study, by, asmeret, asefaw, berhe, land, degradation, caused, by, land, mines, can, be, classified, into, five, groups, access, denial, loss, of, biodiversity, micro, relief, disruption, chemical, composition, and, loss, of, productivity, the, effects, of, an, explosion, depend, on, i, the, objectives, and, methodological, approaches, of, the, investigation, ii, concentration, of, mines, in, a, unit, area, iii, chemical, composition, and, toxicity, of, the, mines, iv, previous, uses, of, the, land, and, v, alternatives, that, are, available, for, the, affected, populations, the, most, prominent, ecological, issue, associated, with, land, mines, or, fear, of, them, is, denial, of, access, to, vital, resources, where, access, refers, to, the, ability, to, use, resources, in, contrast, to, property, the, right, to, use, them, the, presence, and, fear, of, presence, of, even, a, single, land, mine, can, discourage, access, for, agriculture, water, supplies, and, possibly, conservation, measures, reconstruction, and, development, of, important, structures, such, as, schools, and, hospitals, are, likely, to, be, delayed, and, populations, may, shift, to, urban, areas, increasing, overcrowding, and, the, risk, of, spreading, diseases, access, denial, can, have, positive, effects, on, the, environment, when, a, mined, area, becomes, a, no, man, s, land, plants, and, vegetation, have, a, chance, to, grow, and, recover, for, example, formerly, arable, lands, in, nicaragua, returned, to, forests, and, remained, undisturbed, after, the, establishment, of, land, mines, similarly, the, penguins, of, the, falkland, islands, have, benefited, because, they, are, not, heavy, enough, to, trigger, the, mines, present, however, these, benefits, can, only, last, as, long, as, animals, tree, limbs, etc, do, not, detonate, the, mines, in, addition, long, idle, periods, could, potentially, end, up, creating, or, exacerbating, loss, of, productivity, particularly, within, land, of, low, quality, land, mines, can, threaten, biodiversity, by, wiping, out, vegetation, and, wildlife, during, explosions, or, demining, this, extra, burden, can, push, threatened, and, endangered, species, to, extinction, they, have, also, been, used, by, poachers, to, target, endangered, species, displaced, refugees, hunt, animals, for, food, and, destroy, habitat, by, making, shelters, shrapnel, or, abrasions, of, bark, or, roots, caused, by, detonated, mines, can, cause, the, slow, death, of, trees, and, provide, entry, sites, for, wood, rotting, fungi, when, land, mines, make, land, unavailable, for, farming, residents, resort, to, the, forests, to, meet, all, of, their, survival, needs, this, exploitation, furthers, the, loss, of, biodiversity, near, mines, that, have, exploded, or, decayed, soils, tend, to, be, contaminated, particularly, with, heavy, metals, products, produced, from, the, explosives, both, organic, and, inorganic, substances, are, most, likely, to, be, long, lasting, water, soluble, and, toxic, even, in, small, amounts, they, can, be, implemented, either, directly, or, indirectly, into, soil, water, bodies, microorganisms, and, plants, with, drinking, water, food, products, or, during, respiration, toxic, compounds, can, also, find, their, way, into, bodies, of, water, and, accumulate, in, land, animals, fish, and, plants, they, can, act, as, a, nerve, poison, to, hamper, growth, with, deadly, effect
