families, that, cater, to, particular, sectors, of, the, computing, industry, windows, unqualified, for, a, consumer, or, corporate, workstation, windows, server, for, a, server, and, windows, iot, for, an, embedded, system, defunct, families, include, windows, 9x, windows, mobile, windows, phone, and, windows, embedded, compact, the, first, version, of, windows, was, released, on, november, 20, 1985, as, a, graphical, operating, system, shell, for, ms, dos, in, response, to, the, growing, interest, in, graphical, user, interfaces, guis, windows, is, the, most, popular, desktop, operating, system, in, the, world, with, a, 70, market, share, as, of, march, 2023, according, to, statcounter, however, windows, is, not, the, most, used, operating, system, when, including, both, mobile, and, desktop, oses, due, to, android, s, massive, growth, globally, since, the, early, 2010s, as, of, today, the, most, recent, version, of, windows, is, windows, 11, for, consumer, pcs, and, tablets, windows, 11, enterprise, for, corporations, and, windows, server, 2025, for, servers, still, supported, are, some, editions, of, windows, 10, windows, server, 2016, or, later, and, exceptionally, with, paid, support, down, to, windows, server, 2012, and, windows, embedded, posready, 7, as, of, today, the, only, active, top, level, family, is, windows, nt, the, first, version, windows, nt, 3, 1, was, intended, for, server, computing, and, corporate, workstations, it, grew, into, a, product, line, of, its, own, and, now, consists, of, four, sub, families, that, tend, to, be, released, almost, simultaneously, and, share, the, same, kernel, these, top, level, windows, families, are, no, longer, actively, developed, the, term, windows, collectively, describes, any, or, all, of, several, generations, of, microsoft, operating, system, products, these, products, are, generally, categorized, as, follows, the, history, of, windows, dates, back, to, 1981, when, microsoft, started, work, on, a, program, called, interface, manager, the, name, windows, comes, from, the, fact, that, the, system, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, graphical, boxes, to, represent, programs, in, the, industry, at, the, time, these, were, called, windows, and, the, underlying, software, was, called, windowing, software, it, was, announced, in, november, 1983, after, the, apple, lisa, but, before, the, macintosh, under, the, name, windows, but, windows, 1, 0, was, not, released, until, november, 1985, windows, 1, 0, was, to, compete, with, apple, s, operating, system, but, achieved, little, popularity, windows, 1, 0, is, not, a, complete, operating, system, rather, it, extends, ms, dos, the, shell, of, windows, 1, 0, is, a, program, known, as, the, ms, dos, executive, components, included, calculator, calendar, cardfile, clipboard, viewer, clock, control, panel, notepad, paint, reversi, terminal, and, write, windows, 1, 0, does, not, allow, overlapping, windows, instead, all, windows, are, tiled, only, modal, dialog, boxes, may, appear, over, other, windows, microsoft, sold, as, included, windows, development, libraries, with, the, c, development, environment, which, included, numerous, windows, samples, windows, 2, 0, was, released, in, december, 1987, and, was, more, popular, than, its, predecessor, it, features, several, improvements, to, the, user, interface, and, memory, management, windows, 2, 03, changed, the, os, from, tiled, windows, to, overlapping, windows, the, result, of, this, change, led, to, apple, computer, filing, a, suit, against, microsoft, alleging, infringement, on, apple, s, copyrights, eventually, settled, in, court, in, microsoft, s, favor, in, 1993, windows, 2, 0, also, introduced, more, sophisticated, keyboard, shortcuts, and, could, make, use, of, expanded, memory, windows, 2, 1, was, released, in, two, different, versions, windows, 286, and, windows, 386, windows, 386, uses, the, virtual, 8086, mode, of, the, intel, 80386, to, multitask, several, dos, programs, and, the, paged, memory, model, to, emulate, expanded, memory, using, available, extended, memory, windows, 286, in, spite, of, its, name, runs, on, both, intel, 8086, and, intel, 80286, processors, it, runs, in, real, mode, but, can, make, use, of, the, high, memory, area, in, addition, to, full, windows, packages, there, were, runtime, only, versions, that, shipped, with, early, windows, software, from, third, parties, and, made, it, possible, to, run, their, windows, software, on, ms, dos, and, without, the, full, windows, feature, set, the, early, versions, of, windows, are, often, thought, of, as, graphical, shells, mostly, because, they, ran, on, top, of, ms, dos, and, used, it, for, file, system, services, however, even, the, earliest, windows, versions, already, assumed, many, typical, operating, system, functions, notably, having, their, own, executable, file, format, and, providing, their, own, device, drivers, timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard, and, sound, unlike, ms, dos, windows, allowed, users, to, execute, multiple, graphical, applications, at, the, same, time, through, cooperative, multitasking, windows, implemented, an, elaborate, segment, based, software, virtual, memory, scheme, which, allows, it, to, run, applications, larger, than, available, memory, code, segments, and, resources, are, swapped, in, and, thrown, away, when, memory, became, scarce, data, segments, moved, in, memory, when, a, given, application, had, relinquished, processor, control, windows, 3, 0, released, in, 1990, improved, the, design, mostly, because, of, virtual, memory, and, loadable, virtual, device, drivers, vxds, that, allow, windows, to, share, arbitrary, devices, between, multi, tasked, dos, applications, windows, 3, 0, applications, can, run, in, protected, mode, which, gives, them, access, to, several, megabytes, of, memory, without, the, obligation, to, participate, in, the, software, virtual, memory, scheme, they, run, inside, the, same, address, space, where, the, segmented, memory, provides, a, degree, of, protection, windows, 3, 0, also, featured, improvements, to, the, user, interface, microsoft, rewrote, critical, operations, from, c, into, assembly, windows, 3, 0, was, the, first, version, of, windows, to, achieve, broad, commercial, success, selling, 2, million, copies, in, the, first, six, months, windows, 3, 1, made, generally, available, on, march, 1, 1992, featured, a, facelift, in, august, 1993, windows, for, workgroups, a, special, version, with,

2001, windows, 3, 2, released, in, 1994, is, an, updated, version, of, the, chinese, version, of, windows, 3, 1, the, update, was, limited, to, this, language, version, as, it, fixed, only, issues, related, to, the, complex, writing, system, of, the, chinese, language, windows, 3, 2, was, generally, sold, by, computer, manufacturers, with, a, ten, disk, version, of, ms, dos, that, also, had, simplified, chinese, characters, in, basic, output, and, some, translated, utilities, the, next, major, consumer, oriented, release, of, windows, windows, 95, was, released, on, august, 24, 1995, while, still, remaining, ms, dos, based, windows, 95, introduced, support, for, native, 32, bit, applications, plug, and, play, hardware, preemptive, multitasking, long, file, names, of, up, to, 255, characters, and, provided, increased, stability, over, its, predecessors, windows, 95, also, introduced, a, redesigned, object, oriented, user, interface, replacing, the, previous, program, manager, with, the, start, menu, taskbar, and, windows, explorer, shell, windows, 95, was, a, major, commercial, success, for, microsoft, ina, fried, of, cnet, remarked, that, by, the, time, windows, 95, was, finally, ushered, off, the, market, in, 2001, it, had, become, a, fixture, on, computer, desktops, around, the, world, microsoft, published, four, oem, service, releases, osr, of, windows, 95, each, of, which, was, roughly, equivalent, to, a, service, pack, the, first, osr, of, windows, 95, was, also, the, first, version, of, windows, to, be, bundled, with, microsoft, s, web, browser, internet, explorer, mainstream, support, for, windows, 95, ended, on, december, 31, 2000, and, extended, support, for, windows, 95, ended, on, december, 31, 2001, windows, 95, was, followed, up, with, the,

interface, enhancements, from, its, windows, nt, based, counterpart, windows, 2000, had, faster, boot, times, than, previous, versions, which, however, required, the, removal, of, the, ability, to, access, a, real, mode, dos, environment, removing, compatibility, with, some, older, programs, expanded, multimedia, functionality, including, windows, media, player, 7, windows, movie, maker, and, the, windows, image, acquisition, framework, for, retrieving, images, from, scanners, and, digital, cameras, additional, system, utilities, such, as, system, file, protection, and, system, restore, and, updated, home, networking, tools, however, windows, me, was, faced, with, criticism, for, its, speed, and, instability, along, with, hardware, compatibility, issues, and, its, removal, of, real, mode, dos, support, pc, world, considered, windows, me, to, be, one, of, the, worst, operating, systems, microsoft, had, ever, released, and, the, fourth, worst, tech, product, of, all, time, in, november, 1988, a, new, development, team, within, microsoft, which, included, former, digital, equipment, corporation, developers, dave, cutler, and, mark, lucovsky, began, work, on, a, revamped, version, of, ibm, and, microsoft, s, os, 2, operating, system, known, as, nt, os, 2, nt, os, 2, was, intended, to, be, a, secure, multi, user, operating, system, with, posix, compatibility, and, a, modular, portable, kernel, with, preemptive, multitasking, and, support, for, multiple, processor, architectures, however, following, the, successful, release, of, windows, 3, 0, the, nt, development, team, decided, to, rework, the, project, to, use, an, extended, 32, bit, port, of, the, windows, api, known, as, win32, instead, of, those, of, os, 2, win32, maintained, a, similar, structure, to, the, windows, apis, allowing, existing, windows, applications, to, easily, be, ported, to, the, platform, but, also, supported, the, capabilities, of, the, existing, nt, kernel, following, its, approval, by, microsoft, s, staff, development, continued, on, what, was, now, windows, nt, the, first, 32, bit, version, of, windows, however, ibm, objected, to, the, changes, and, ultimately, continued, os, 2, development, on, its, own, windows, nt, was, the, first, windows, operating, system, based, on, a, hybrid, kernel, the, hybrid, kernel, was, designed, as, a, modified, microkernel, influenced, by, the, mach, microkernel, developed, by, richard, rashid, at, carnegie, mellon, university, but, without, meeting, all, of, the, criteria, of, a, pure, microkernel, the, first, release, of, the, resulting, operating, system, windows, nt, 3, 1, named, to, associate, it, with, windows, 3, 1, was, released, in, july, 1993, with, versions, for, desktop, workstations, and, servers, windows, nt, 3, 5, was, released, in, september, 1994, focusing, on, performance, improvements, and, support, for, novell, s, netware, and, was, followed, up, by, windows, nt, 3, 51, in, may, 1995,

platforms, before, the, x86, based, personal, computer, became, dominant, in, the, professional, world, windows, nt, 4, 0, and, its, predecessors, supported, powerpc, dec, alpha, and, mips, r4000, although, some, of, the, platforms, implement, 64, bit, computing, the, os, treated, them, as, 32, bit, windows, 2000, dropped, support, for, all, platforms, except, the, third, generation, x86, known, as, ia, 32, or, newer, in, 32, bit, mode, the, client, line, of, the, windows, nt, family, still, ran, on, ia, 32, up, to, windows, 10, the, server, line, of, the, windows, nt, family, still, ran, on, ia, 32, up, to, windows, server, 2008, with, the, introduction, of, the, intel, itanium, architecture, ia, 64, microsoft, released, new, versions, of, windows, to, support, it, itanium, versions, of, windows, xp, and, windows, server, 2003, were, released, at, the, same, time, as, their, mainstream, x86, counterparts, windows, xp, 64, bit, edition, version, 2003, released, in, 2003, is, the, last, windows, client, operating, system, to, support, itanium, windows, server, line, continues, to, support, this, platform, until, windows, server, 2012, windows, server, 2008, r2, is, the, last, windows, operating, system, to, support, itanium, architecture, on, april, 25, 2005, microsoft, released, windows, xp, professional, x64, edition, and, windows, server, 2003, x64, editions, to, support, x86, 64, or, simply, x64, the, 64, bit, version, of, x86, architecture, windows, vista, was, the, first, client, version, of, windows, nt, to, be, released, simultaneously, in, ia, 32, and, x64, editions, as, of, 2024, x64, is, still, supported, an, edition, of, windows, 8, known, as, windows, rt, was, specifically, created, for, computers, with, arm, architecture, and, while, arm, is, still, used, for, windows, smartphones, with, windows, 10, tablets, with, windows, rt, will, not, be, updated, starting, from, windows, 10, fall, creators, update, version, 1709, and, later, includes, support, for, arm, based, pcs, windows, ce, officially, known, as, windows, embedded, compact, is, an, edition, of, windows, that, runs, on, minimalistic, computers, like, satellite, navigation, systems, and, some, mobile, phones, windows, embedded, compact, is, based, on, its, own, dedicated, kernel, dubbed, windows, ce, kernel, microsoft, licenses, windows, ce, to, oems, and, device, makers, the, oems, and, device, makers, can, modify, and, create, their, own, user, interfaces, and, experiences, while, windows, ce, provides, the, technical, foundation, to, do, so, windows, ce, was, used, in, the, dreamcast, along, with, sega, s, own, proprietary, os, for, the, console, windows, ce, was, the, core, from, which, windows, mobile, was, derived, its, successor, windows, phone, 7, was, based, on, components, from, both, windows, ce, 6, 0, r3, and, windows, ce, 7, 0, windows, phone, 8, however, is, based, on, the, same, nt, kernel, as, windows, 8, windows, embedded, compact, is, not, to, be, confused, with, windows, xp, embedded, or, windows, nt, 4, 0, embedded, modular, editions, of, windows, based, on, windows, nt, kernel, xbox, os, is, an, unofficial, name, given, to, the, version, of, windows, that, runs, on, xbox, consoles, from, xbox, one, onwards, it, is, an, implementation, with, an, emphasis, on, virtualization, using, hyper, v, as, it, is, three, operating, systems, running, at, once, consisting, of, the, core, operating, system, a, second, implemented, for, games, and, a, more, windows, like, environment, for, applications, microsoft, updates, xbox, one, s, os, every, month, and, these, updates, can, be, downloaded, from, the, xbox, live, service, to, the, xbox, and, subsequently, installed, or, by, using, offline, recovery, images, downloaded, via, a, pc, it, was, originally, based, on, nt, 6, 2, windows, 8, kernel, and, the, latest, version, runs, on, an, nt, 10, 0, base, this, system, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, windows, 10, on, xbox, one, xbox, one, and, xbox, series, operating, systems, also, allow, limited, due, to, licensing, restrictions, and, testing, resources, backward, compatibility, with, previous, generation, hardware, and, the, xbox, 360, s, system, is, backwards, compatible, with, the, original, xbox, up, to, and, including, every, version, before, windows, 2000, microsoft, used, an, in, house, version, control, system, named, source, library, manager, slm, shortly, after, windows, 2000, was, released, microsoft, switched, to, a, fork, of, perforce, named, source, depot, this, system, was, used, up, until, 2017, once, the, system, could, not, keep, up, with, the, size, of, windows, microsoft, had, begun, to, integrate, git, into, team, foundation, server, in, 2013, but, windows, and, office, continued, to, rely, on, source, depot, the, windows, code, was, divided, among, 65, different, repositories, with, a, kind, of, virtualization, layer, to, produce, unified, view, of, all, of, the, code, in, 2017, microsoft, announced, that, it, would, start, using, git, an, open, source, version, control, system, created, by, linus, torvalds, and, in, may, 2017, they, reported, that, the, migration, into, a, new, git, repository, was, complete, because, of, its, large, decades, long, history, however, the, windows, codebase, is, not, especially, well, suited, to, the, decentralized, nature, of, linux, development, that, git, was, originally, created, to, manage, each, git, repository, contains, a, complete, history, of, all, the, files, which, proved, unworkable, for, windows, developers, because, cloning, the, whole, repository, takes, several, hours, microsoft, has, been, working, on, a, new, project, called, the, virtual, file, system, for, git, vfsforgit, to, address, these, challenges, in, 2021, the, vfs, for, git, was, superseded, by, scalar, version, market, share, as, a, percentage, of, desktop, and, laptop, systems, using, microsoft, windows, according, to, statcounter, data, as, of, august, 2024, use, of, windows, 10, has, exceeded, windows, 7, globally, since, early, 2018, for, desktop, and, laptop, computers, according, to, net, applications, and, statcounter, which, track, the, use, of, operating, systems, in, devices, that, are, active, on, the, web, windows, was, the, most, used, operating, system, family, in, august, 2021, with, around, 91, usage, share, according, to, net, applications, and, around, 76, usage, share, according, to, statcounter, including, personal, computers, of, all, kinds, e, g, desktops, laptops, mobile, devices, and, game, consoles, windows, oses, accounted, for, 32, 67, of, usage, share, in, august, 2021, compared, to, android, highest, at, 46, 03, ios, s, 13, 76, ipados, s, 2, 81, and, macos, s, 2, 51, according, to, net, applications, and, 30, 73, of, usage, share, in, august, 2021, compared, to, android, highest, at, 42, 56, ios, ipados, s, 16, 53, and, macos, s, 6, 51, according, to, statcounter, those, statistics, do, not, include, servers, including, cloud, computing, where, linux, has, significantly, more, market, share, than, windows, as, net, applications, and, statcounter, use, web, browsing, as, a, proxy, for, all, use, early, versions, of, windows, were, designed, at, a, time, where, malware, and, networking, were, less, common, and, had, few, built, in, security, features, they, did, not, provide, access, privileges, to, allow, a, user, to, prevent, other, users, from, accessing, their, files, and, they, did, not, provide, memory, protection, to, prevent, one, process, from, reading, or, writing, another, process, s, address, space, or, to, prevent, a, process, from, code, or, data, used, by, privileged, mode, code, while, the, windows, 9x, series, offered, the, option, of, having, profiles, for, multiple, users, with, separate, profiles, and, home, folders, it, had, no, concept, of, access, privileges, allowing, any, user, to, edit, others, files, in, addition, while, it, ran, separate, 32, bit, applications, in, separate, address, spaces, protecting, an, application, s, code, and, data, from, being, read, or, written, by, another, application, it, did, not, protect, the, first, megabyte, of, memory, from, userland, applications, for, compatibility, reasons, this, area, of, memory, contains, code, critical, to, the, functioning, of, the, operating, system, and, by, writing, into, this, area, of, memory, an, application, can, crash, or, freeze, the, operating, system, this, was, a, source, of, instability, as, faulty, applications, could, accidentally, write, into, this, region, potentially, corrupting, important, operating, system, memory, which, usually, resulted, in, some, form, of, system, error, and, halt, windows, nt, was, far, more, secure, implementing, access, privileges, and, full, memory, protection, and, while, 32, bit, programs, meeting, the, dod, s, c2, security, rating, yet, these, advantages, were, nullified, by, the, fact, that, prior, to, windows, vista, the, default, user, account, created, during, the, setup, process, was, an, administrator, account, the, user, and, any, program, the, user, launched, had, full, access, to, the, machine, though, windows, xp, did, offer, an, option, of, turning, administrator, accounts, into, limited, accounts, the, majority, of, home, users, did, not, do, so, partially, due, to, the, number, of, programs, which, required, administrator, rights, to, function, properly, as, a, result, most, home, users, still, ran, as, administrator, all, the, time, these, architectural, flaws, combined, with, windows, s, very, high, popularity, made, windows, a, frequent, target, of, computer, worm, and, virus, writers, furthermore, although, windows, nt, and, its, successors, are, designed, for, security, including, on, a, network, and, multi, user, pcs, they, were, not, initially, designed, with, internet, security, in, mind, as, much, since, when, it, was, first, developed, in, the, early, 1990s, internet, use, was, less, prevalent, in, a, 2002, strategy, memo, entitled, trustworthy, computing, sent, to, every, microsoft, employee, bill, gates, declared, that, security, should, become, microsoft, s, highest, priority, windows, vista, introduced, a, privilege, elevation, system, called, user, account, control, when, logging, in, as, a, standard, user, a, logon, session, is, created, and, a, token, containing, only, the, most, basic, privileges, is, assigned, in, this, way, the, new, logon, session, is, incapable, of, making, changes, that, would, affect, the, entire, system, when, logging, in, as, a, user, in, the, administrators, group, two, separate, tokens, are, assigned, the, first, token, contains, all, privileges, typically, awarded, to, an, administrator, and, the, second, is, a, restricted, token, similar, to, what, a, standard, user, would, receive, user, applications, including, the, windows, shell, are, then, started, with, the, restricted, token, resulting, in, a, reduced, privilege, environment, even, under, an, administrator, account, when, an, application, requests, higher, privileges, or, run, as, administrator, is, clicked, uac, will, prompt, for, confirmation, and, if, consent, is, given, including, administrator, credentials, if, the, account, requesting, the, elevation, is, not, a,

perform, electronic, surveillance, and, cyber, warfare, such, as, the, ability, to, compromise, operating, systems, such, as, windows, in, august, 2019, computer, experts, reported, that, the, bluekeep, security, vulnerability, cve, 2019, 0708, that, potentially, affects, older, unpatched, windows, versions, via, the, program, s, remote, desktop, protocol, allowing, for, the, possibility, of, remote, code, execution, may, include, related, flaws, collectively, named, dejablue, affecting, newer, windows, versions, i, e, windows, 7, and, all, recent, versions, as, well, in, addition, experts, reported, a, microsoft, security, vulnerability, cve, 2019, 1162, based, on, legacy, code, involving, microsoft, ctf, and, ctfmon, ctfmon, exe, that, affects, all, windows, versions, from, windows, xp, to, the, then, most, recent, windows, 10, versions, a, patch, to, correct, the, flaw, is, available, microsoft, releases, security, patches, through, its, windows, update, service, approximately, once, a, month, usually, the, second, tuesday, of, the, month, although, critical, updates, are, made, available, at, shorter, intervals, when, necessary, versions, subsequent, to, windows, 2000, sp3, and, windows, xp, implemented, automatic, download, and, installation, of, updates, substantially, increasing, the, number, of, users, installing, security, updates, windows, integrates, the, windows, defender, antivirus, which, is, seen, as, one, of, the, best, available, windows, also, implements, secure, boot, control, flow, guard, ransomware, protection, bitlocker, disk, encryption, a, firewall, and, windows, smartscreen, in, july, 2024, microsoft, signalled, an, intention, to, limit, kernel, access, and, improve, overall, security, following, a, highly, publicised, crowdstrike, update, that, caused, 8, 5, million, windows, pcs, to, crash, all, windows, versions, from, windows, nt, 3, have, been, based, on, a, file, system, permission, system, referred, to, as, agdlp, accounts, global, domain, local, permissions, in, which, file, permissions, are, applied, to, the, file, folder, in, the, form, of, a, local, group, which, then, has, other, global, groups, as, members, these, global, groups, then, hold, other, groups, or, users, depending, on, different, windows, versions, used, this, system, varies, from, other, vendor, products, such, as, linux, and, netware, due, to, the, static, allocation, of, permission, being, applied, directly, to, the, file, or, folder, however, using, this, process, of, aglp, agdlp, agudlp, allows, a, small, number, of, static, permissions, to, be, applied, and, allows, for, easy, changes, to, the, account, groups, without, reapplying, the, file, permissions, on, the, files, and, folders, owing, to, the, operating, system, s, popularity, a, number, of, applications, have, been, released, that, aim, to, provide, compatibility, with, windows, applications, either, as, a, compatibility, layer, for, another, operating, system, or, as, a, standalone, system, that, can, run, software, written, for, windows, out, of, the, box, these, include
