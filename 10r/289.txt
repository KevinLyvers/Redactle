referred, to, defensive, walls, and, ramparts, the, purposes, of, walls, in, buildings, are, to, support, roofs, floors, and, ceilings, to, enclose, a, space, as, part, of, the, building, envelope, along, with, a, roof, to, give, buildings, form, and, to, provide, shelter, and, security, in, addition, the, wall, may, house, various, types, of, utilities, such, as, electrical, wiring, or, plumbing, wall, construction, falls, into, two, basic, categories, framed, walls, or, mass, walls, in, framed, walls, the, load, is, transferred, to, the, foundation, through, posts, columns, or, studs, framed, walls, most, often, have, three, or, more, separate, components, the, structural, elements, such, as, 2, 4, studs, in, a, house, wall, insulation, and, finish, elements, or, surfaces, such, as, drywall, or, panelling, mass, walls, are, of, a, solid, material, including, masonry, concrete, including, slipform, stonemasonry, log, building, cordwood, construction, adobe, rammed,

and, or, fire, codes, there, are, three, basic, methods, walls, control, water, intrusion, moisture, storage, drained, cladding, or, face, sealed, cladding, moisture, storage, is, typical, of, stone, and, brick, mass, wall, buildings, where, moisture, is, absorbed, and, released, by, the, walls, of, the, structure, itself, drained, cladding, also, known, as, screened, walls, acknowledges, moisture, will, penetrate, the, cladding, so, a, moisture, barrier, such, as, housewrap, or, felt, paper, inside, the, cladding, provides, a, second, line, of, defense, and, sometimes, a, drainage, plane, or, air, gap, allows, a, path, for, the, moisture, to, drain, down, through, and, exit, the, wall, sometimes, ventilation, is, provided, in, addition, to, the, drainage, plane, such, as, in, rainscreen, construction, face, sealed, also, called, barrier, wall, or, perfect, barrier, cladding, relies, on, maintaining, a, leak, free, surface, of, the, cladding, examples, of, face, sealed, cladding, are, the, early, exterior, insulation, finishing, systems, structural, glazing, metal, clad, panels, and, corrugated, metal, building, walls, frequently, become, works, of, art, externally, and, internally, such, as, when, featuring, mosaic, work, or, when, murals, are, painted, on, them, or, as, design, foci, when, they, exhibit, textures, or, painted, finishes, for, effect, in, architecture, and, civil, engineering, curtain, wall, refers, to, a, building, facade, that, is, not, load, bearing, but, provides, decoration, finish, front, face, or, historical, preservation, precast, walls, are, walls, which, have, been, manufactured, in, a, factory, and, then, shipped, to, where, it, is, needed, ready, to, install, it, is, faster, to, install, compared, to, brick, and, other, walls, and, may, have, a, lower, cost, compared, to, other, types, of, wall, precast, walls, are, cost, effective, compare, to, brick, wall, compound, wall, mullion, walls, are, a, structural, system, that, carries, the, load, of, the, floor, slab, on, prefabricated, panels, around, the, perimeter, a, partition, wall, is, a, usually, thin, wall, that, is, used, to, separate, or, divide, a, room, primarily, a, pre, existing, one, partition, walls, are, usually, not, load, bearing, and, can, be, constructed, out, of, many, materials, including, steel, panels, bricks, cloth, plastic,

from, concrete, including, pre, cast, concrete, blocks, metal, framed, partitioning, is, also, available, this, partition, consists, of, track, used, primarily, at, the, base, and, head, of, the, partition, and, studs, vertical, sections, fixed, into, the, track, typically, spaced, at, 24, 16, or, at, 12, internal, wall, partitions, also, known, as, office, partitioning, are, usually, made, of, plasterboard, drywall, or, varieties, of, glass, toughened, glass, is, a, common, option, as, low, iron, glass, better, known, as, opti, white, glass, increases, light, and, solar, heat, transmission, wall, partitions, are, constructed, using, beads, and, tracking, that, is, either, hung, from, the, ceiling, or, fixed, into, the, ground, the, panels, are, inserted, into, the, tracking, and, fixed, some, wall, partition, variations, specify, their, fire, resistance, and, acoustic, performance, rating, movable, partitions, are, walls, that, open, to, join, two, or, more, rooms, into, one, large, floor, area, these, include, party, walls, are, walls, that, separate, buildings, or, units, within, a, building, they, provide, fire, resistance, and, sound, resistance, between, occupants, in, a, building, the, minimum, fire, resistance, and, sound, resistance, required, for, the, party, wall, is, determined, by, a, building, code, and, may, be, modified, to, suit, a, variety, of, situations, ownership, of, such, walls, can, become, a, legal, issue, it, is, not, a, load, bearing, wall, and, may, be, owned, by, different, people, an, infill, wall, is, the, supported, wall, that, closes, the, perimeter, of, a, building, constructed, with, a, three, dimensional, framework, structure, fire, walls, resist, spread, of, fire, within, or, sometimes, between, structures, to, provide, passive, fire, protection, a, delay, in, the, spread, of, fire, gives, occupants, more, time, to, escape, and, fire, fighters, more, time, to, extinguish, the, fire, some, fire, walls, allow, fire, resistive, window, assemblies, and, are, made, of, non, combustible, material, such, as, concrete, cement, block, brick, or, fire, rated, drywall, wall, penetrations, are, sealed, with, fire, resistive, materials, a, doorway, in, a, firewall, must, have, a, rated, fire, door, fire, walls, provide, varying, resistance, to, the, spread, of, fire, e, g, one, two, three, or, four, hours, firewalls, can, also, act, as, smoke, barriers, when, constructed, vertically, from, slab, to, roof, deck, and, horizontally, from, an, exterior, wall, to, exterior, wall, subdividing, a, building, into, sections, shear, walls, resist, lateral, forces, such, as, in, an, earthquake, or, severe, wind, there, are, different, kinds, of, shear, walls, such, as, the, steel,

demountable, walls, fall, into, 3, different, main, types, a, trombe, wall, in, passive, solar, building, design, acts, as, a, heat, sink, on, a, ship, a, wall, that, separates, major, compartments, is, called, a, bulkhead, a, thinner, wall, between, cabins, is, called, a, partition, boundary, walls, include, privacy, walls, boundary, marking, walls, on, property, and, town, walls, these, intergrade, into, fences, the, conventional, differentiation, is, that, a, fence, is, of, minimal, thickness, and, often, open, in, nature, while, a, wall, is, usually, more, than, a, nominal, thickness, and, is, completely, closed, or, opaque, more, to, the, point, an, exterior, structure, of, wood, or, wire, is, generally, called, a, fence, but, one, of, masonry, is, a, wall, a, common, term, for, both, is, barrier, which, is, convenient, for, structures, that, are, partly, wall, and, partly, fence, for, example, the, berlin, wall, another, kind, of, wall, fence, ambiguity, is, the, ha, ha, which, is, set, below, ground, level, to, protect, a, view, yet, acts, as, a, barrier, to, cattle, for, example, before, the, invention, of, artillery, many, of, the, world, s, cities, and, towns, particularly, in, europe, and, asia, had, defensive, or, protective, walls, also, called, town, walls, or, city, walls, in, fact, the, english, word, wall, derives, from, latin, vallum, a, type, of, fortification, wall, these, walls, are, no, longer, relevant, for, defense, so, such, cities, have, grown, beyond, their, walls, and, many, fortification, walls, or, portions, of, them, have, been, torn, down, for, example, in, rome, italy, and, beijing, china, examples, of, protective, walls, on, a, much, larger, scale, include, the, great, wall, of, china, and, hadrian, s, wall, some, walls, formally, mark, the, border, between, one, population, and, another, a, border, wall, is, constructed, to, limit, the, movement, of, people, across, a, certain, line, or, border, these, structures, vary, in, placement, with, regard, to, international, borders, and, topography, the, most, famous, example, of, border, barrier, in, history, is, probably, the, great, wall, of, china, a, series, of, walls, that, separated, the, empire, of, china, from, nomadic, powers, to, the, north, the, most, prominent, recent, example, is, the, berlin, wall, which, surrounded, the, enclave, of, west, berlin, and, separated, it, from, east, germany, for, most, of, the, cold, war, era, the, us, mexico, border, wall, separating, the, united, states, and, mexico, is, another, recent, example, in, areas, of, rocky, soils, around, the, world, farmers, have, often, pulled, large, quantities, of, stone, out, of, their, fields, to, make, farming, easier, and, have, stacked, those, stones, to, make, walls, that, either, mark, the, field, boundary, or, the, property, boundary, or, both, retaining, walls, resist, movement, of, earth, stone, or, water, they, may, be, part, of, a, building, or, external, the, ground, surface, or, water, on, one, side, of, a, retaining, wall, is, typically, higher, than, on, the, other, side, a, dike, is, a, retaining, wall, as, is, a, levee, a, load, bearing, foundation, wall, and, a, sea, wall, special, laws, often, govern, walls, that, neighbouring, properties, share, typically, one, neighbour, cannot, alter, the, common, wall, if, it, is, likely, to, affect, the, building, or, property, on, the, other, side, a, wall, may, also, separate, apartment, or, hotel, rooms, from, each, other, each, wall, has, two, sides, and, breaking, a, wall, on, one, side, will, break, the, wall, on, the, other, side, portable, walls, such, as, room, dividers, or, portable, partitions, divide, a, larger, open, space, into, smaller, rooms, portable, walls, can, be, static, such, as, cubicle, walls, or, can, be, wall, panels, mounted, on, casters, to, provide, an, easy, way, to, reconfigure, assembly, space, they, are, often, found, inside, schools, churches, convention, centers, hotels, and, corporate, facilities, a, temporary, wall, is, constructed, for, easy, removal, or, demolition, a, typical, temporary, wall, can, be, constructed, with, 1, 2, 6, mm, to, 5, 8, 16, mm, sheet, rock, plasterboard, metal, 2, 3s, approx, 5, 7, cm, or, 2, 4s, or, taped, plastered, and, compounded, most, installation, companies, use, lattice, strips, of, wood, to, cover, the, joints, of, the, temporary, wall, with, the, ceiling, these, are, sometimes, known, as, pressurized, walls, or, temporary, pressurized, walls, walls, are, often, seen, in, popular, culture, oftentimes, representing, barriers, preventing, progress, or, entry, for, example, the, progressive, psychedelic, rock, band, pink, floyd, used, a, metaphorical, wall, to, represent,

and, as, a, codification, of, assumptions, breaches, of, the, wall, who, is, allowed, to, cross, it, and, who, is, not, and, its, destruction, have, important, symbolic, logistical, and, socio, political, implications, in, the, storyline, reportedly, over, 700, feet, high, and, 100, leagues, 300, miles, wide, it, divides, the, northern, border, of, the, seven, kingdoms, realm, from, the, domain, of, the, wildlings, and, several, categories, of, undead, who, live, beyond, it, in, a, real, life, example, the, berlin, wall, constructed, by, the, soviet, union, to, divide, berlin, into, nato, and, warsaw, pact, zones, of, occupation, became, a, worldwide, symbol, of, oppression, and, isolation, another, common, usage, is, as, a, communal, surface, to, write, upon, for, instance, the,
