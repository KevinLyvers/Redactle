a, spring, is, a, device, consisting, of, an, elastic, but, largely, rigid, material, typically, metal, bent, or, molded, into, a, form, especially, a, coil, that, can, return, into, shape, after, being, compressed, or, extended, springs, can, store, energy, when, compressed, in, everyday, use, the, term, most, often, refers, to, coil, springs, but, there, are, many, different, spring, designs, modern, springs, are, typically, manufactured, from, spring, steel, an, example, of, a, non, metallic, spring, is, the, bow, made, traditionally, of, flexible, yew, wood, which, when, drawn, stores, energy, to, propel, an, arrow, when, a, conventional, spring, without, stiffness, variability, features, is, compressed, or, stretched, from, its, resting, position, it, exerts, an, opposing, force, approximately, proportional, to, its, change, in, length, this, approximation, breaks, down, for, larger, deflections, the, rate, or, spring, constant, of, a, spring, is, the, change, in, the, force, it, exerts, divided, by, the, change, in, deflection, of, the, spring, that, is, it, is, the, gradient, of, the, force, versus, deflection, curve, an, extension, or, compression, spring, s, rate, is, expressed, in, units, of, force, divided, by, distance, for, example, or, n, m, or, lbf, in, a, torsion, spring, is, a, spring, that, works, by, twisting, when, it, is, twisted, about, its, axis, by, an, angle, it, produces, a, torque, proportional, to, the, angle, a, torsion, spring, s, rate, is, in, units, of, torque, divided, by, angle, such, as, n, m, rad, or, ft, lbf, degree, the, inverse, of, spring, rate, is, compliance, that, is, if, a, spring, has, a, rate, of, 10, n, mm, it, has, a, compliance, of, 0, 1, mm, n, the, stiffness, or, rate, of, springs, in, parallel, is, additive, as, is, the, compliance, of, springs, in, series, springs, are, made, from, a, variety, of, elastic, materials, the, most, common, being, spring, steel, small, springs, can, be, wound, from, pre, hardened, stock, while, larger, ones, are, made, from, annealed, steel, and, hardened, after, manufacture, some, non, ferrous, metals, are, also, used, including, phosphor, bronze, and, titanium, for, parts, requiring, corrosion, resistance, and, low, resistance, beryllium, copper, for, springs, carrying, electric, current, simple, non, coiled, springs, have, been, used, throughout, human, history, e, g, the, bow, and, arrow, in, the, bronze, age, more, sophisticated, spring, devices, were, used, as, shown, by, the, spread, of, tweezers, in, many, cultures, ctesibius, of, alexandria, developed, a, method, for, making, springs, out, of, an, alloy, of, bronze, with, an, increased, proportion, of, tin, hardened, by, hammering, after, it, was, cast, coiled, springs, appeared, early, in, the, 15th, century, in, door, locks, the, first, spring, powered, clocks, appeared, in, that, century, and, evolved, into, the, first, large, watches, by, the, 16th, century, in, 1676, british, physicist, robert, hooke, postulated, hooke, s, law, which, states, that, the, force, a, spring, exerts, is, proportional, to, its, extension, on, march, 8, 1850, john, evans, founder, of, john, evans, sons, incorporated, opened, his, business, in, new, haven, connecticut, manufacturing, flat, springs, for, carriages, and, other, vehicles, as, well, as, the, machinery, to, manufacture, the, springs, evans, was, a, welsh, blacksmith, and, springmaker, who, emigrated, to, the, united, states, in, 1847, john, evans, sons, became, america, s, oldest, springmaker, which, continues, to, operate, today, springs, can, be, classified, depending, on, how, the, load, force, is, applied, to, them, they, can, also, be, classified, based, on, their, shape, the, most, common, types, of, spring, are, other, types, include, an, ideal, spring, acts, in, accordance, with, hooke, s, law, which, states, that, the, force, with, which, the, spring, pushes, back, is, linearly, proportional, to, the, distance, from, its, equilibrium, length, where, most, real, springs, approximately, follow, hooke, s, law, if, not, stretched, or, compressed, beyond, their, elastic, limit, coil, springs, and, other, common, springs, typically, obey, hooke, s, law, there, are, useful, springs, that, don, t, springs, based, on, beam, bending, can, for, example, produce, forces, that, vary, nonlinearly, with, displacement, if, made, with, constant, pitch, wire, thickness, conical, springs, have, a, variable, rate, however, a, conical, spring, can, be, made, to, have, a, constant, rate, by, creating, the, spring, with, a, variable, pitch, a, larger, pitch, in, the, larger, diameter, coils, and, a, smaller, pitch, in, the, smaller, diameter, coils, forces, the, spring, to, collapse, or, extend, all, the, coils, at, the, same, rate, when, deformed, since, force, is, equal, to, mass, m, times, acceleration, a, the, force, equation, for, a, spring, obeying, hooke, s, law, looks, like, the, mass, of, the, spring, is, small, in, comparison, to, the, mass, of, the, attached, mass, and, is, ignored, since, acceleration, is, simply, the, second, derivative, of, x, with, respect, to, time, this, is, a, second, order, linear, differential, equation, for, the, displacement, x, displaystyle, x, as, a, function, of, time, rearranging, the, solution, of, which, is, the, sum, of, a, sine, and, cosine, a, displaystyle, a, and, b, displaystyle, b, are, arbitrary, constants, that, may, be, found, by, considering, the, initial, displacement, and, velocity, of, the, mass, the, graph, of, this, function, with, b, 0, displaystyle, b, 0, zero, initial, position, with, some, positive, initial, velocity, is, displayed, in, the, image, on, the, right, in, simple, harmonic, motion, of, a, spring, mass, system, energy, will, fluctuate, between, kinetic, energy, and, potential, energy, but, the, total, energy, of, the, system, remains, the, same, a, spring, that, obeys, hooke, s, law, with, spring, constant, k, will, have, a, total, system, energy, e, of, e, 1, 2, k, a, 2, displaystyle, e, left, frac, 1, 2, right, ka, 2, here, a, is, the, amplitude, of, the, wave, like, motion, that, is, produced, by, the, oscillating, behavior, of, the, spring, the, potential, energy, u, of, such, a, system, can, be, determined, through, the, spring, constant, k, and, its, displacement, x, u, 1, 2, k, x, 2, displaystyle, u, left, frac, 1, 2, right, kx, 2, the, kinetic, energy, k, of, an, object, in, simple, harmonic, motion, can, be, found, using, the, mass, of, the, attached, object, m, and, the, velocity, at, which, the, object, oscillates, v, k, 1, 2, m, v, 2, displaystyle, k, left, frac, 1, 2, right, mv, 2, since, there, is, no, energy, loss, in, such, a, system, energy, is, always, conserved, and, thus, e, k, u, displaystyle, e, k, u, the, angular, frequency, of, an, object, in, simple, harmonic, motion, given, in, radians, per, second, is, found, using, the, spring, constant, k, and, the, mass, of, the, oscillating, object, m, k, m, displaystyle, omega, sqrt, frac, k, m, the, period, t, the, amount, of, time, for, the, spring, mass, system, to, complete, one, full, cycle, of, such, harmonic, motion, is, given, by, t, 2, 2, m, k, displaystyle, t, frac, 2, pi, omega, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, m, k, the, frequency, f, the, number, of, oscillations, per, unit, time, of, something, in, simple, harmonic, motion, is, found, by, taking, the, inverse, of, the, period, f, 1, t, 2, 1, 2, k, m, displaystyle, f, frac, 1, t, frac, omega, 2, pi, frac, 1, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, k, m, in, classical, physics, a, spring, can, be, seen, as, a, device, that, stores, potential, energy, specifically, elastic, potential, energy, by, straining, the, bonds, between, the, atoms, of, an, elastic, material, hooke, s, law, of, elasticity, states, that, the, extension, of, an, elastic, rod, its, distended, length, minus, its, relaxed, length, is, linearly, proportional, to, its, tension, the, force, used, to, stretch, it, similarly, the, contraction, negative, extension, is, proportional, to, the, compression, negative, tension, this, law, actually, holds, only, approximately, and, only, when, the, deformation, extension, or, contraction, is, small, compared, to, the, rod, s, overall, length, for, deformations, beyond, the, elastic, limit, atomic, bonds, get, broken, or, rearranged, and, a, spring, may, snap, buckle, or, permanently, deform, many, materials, have, no, clearly, defined, elastic, limit, and, hooke, s, law, can, not, be, meaningfully, applied, to, these, materials, moreover, for, the, superelastic, materials, the, linear, relationship, between, force, and, displacement, is, appropriate, only, in, the, low, strain, region, hooke, s, law, is, a, mathematical, consequence, of, the, fact, that, the, potential, energy, of, the, rod, is, a, minimum, when, it, has, its, relaxed, length, any, smooth, function, of, one, variable, approximates, a, quadratic, function, when, examined, near, enough, to, its, minimum, point, as, can, be, seen, by, examining, the, taylor, series, therefore, the, force, which, is, the, derivative, of, energy, with, respect, to, displacement, approximates, a, linear, function, force, of, fully, compressed, spring, where, zero, length, spring, is, a, term, for, a, specially, designed, coil, spring, that, would, exert, zero, force, if, it, had, zero, length, that, is, in, a, line, graph, of, the, spring, s, force, versus, its, length, the, line, passes, through, the, origin, a, real, coil, spring, will, not, contract, to, zero, length, because, at, some, point, the, coils, touch, each, other, length, here, is, defined, as, the, distance, between, the, axes, of, the, pivots, at, each, end, of, the, spring, regardless, of, any, inelastic, portion, in, between, zero, length, springs, are, made, by, manufacturing, a, coil, spring, with, built, in, tension, a, twist, is, introduced, into, the, wire, as, it, is, coiled, during, manufacture, this, works, because, a, coiled, spring, unwinds, as, it, stretches, so, if, it, could, contract, further, the, equilibrium, point, of, the, spring, the, point, at, which, its, restoring, force, is, zero, occurs, at, a, length, of, zero, in, practice, the, manufacture, of, springs, is, typically, not, accurate, enough, to, produce, springs, with, tension, consistent, enough, for, applications, that, use, zero, length, springs, so, they, are, made, by, combining, a, negative, length, spring, made, with, even, more, tension, so, its, equilibrium, point, would, be, at, a, negative, length, with, a, piece, of, inelastic, material, of, the, proper, length, so, the, zero, force, point, would, occur, at, zero, length, a, zero, length, spring, can, be, attached, to, a, mass, on, a, hinged, boom, in, such, a, way, that, the, force, on, the, mass, is, almost, exactly, balanced, by, the, vertical, component, of, the, force, from, the, spring, whatever, the, position, of, the, boom, this, creates, a, horizontal, pendulum, with, very, long, oscillation, period, long, period, pendulums, enable, seismometers, to, sense, the, slowest, waves, from, earthquakes, the, lacoste, suspension, with, zero, length, springs, is, also, used, in, gravimeters, because, it, is, very, sensitive, to, changes, in, gravity, springs, for, closing, doors, are, often, made, to, have, roughly, zero, length, so, that, they, exert, force, even, when, the, door, is, almost, closed, so, they, can, hold, it, closed, firmly
