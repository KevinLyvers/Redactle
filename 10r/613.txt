a, space, capsule, is, a, spacecraft, designed, to, transport, cargo, scientific, experiments, and, or, astronauts, to, and, from, space, capsules, are, distinguished, from, other, spacecraft, by, the, ability, to, survive, reentry, and, return, a, payload, to, the, earth, s, surface, from, orbit, or, sub, orbit, and, are, distinguished, from, other, types, of, recoverable, spacecraft, by, their, blunt, shape, not, having, wings, and, often, containing, little, fuel, other, than, what, is, necessary, for, a, safe, return, capsule, based, crewed, spacecraft, such, as, soyuz, or, orion, are, often, supported, by, a, service, or, adapter, module, and, sometimes, augmented, with, an, extra, module, for, extended, space, operations, capsules, make, up, the, majority, of, crewed, spacecraft, designs, although, one, crewed, spaceplane, the, space, shuttle, has, flown, in, orbit, current, examples, of, crewed, space, capsules, include, soyuz, shenzhou, and, dragon, 2, examples, of, new, crew, capsules, currently, in, development, include, nasa, s, orion, boeing, s, starliner, russia, s, orel, india, s, gaganyaan, and, china, s, mengzhou, historic, examples, of, crewed, capsules, include, vostok, mercury, voskhod, gemini, and, apollo, and, active, programs, include, the, new, shepard, launches, a, crewed, space, capsule, must, be, able, to, sustain, life, in, an, often, demanding, thermal, and, radiation, environment, in, the, vacuum, of, space, it, may, be, expendable, used, once, like, soyuz, or, reusable, like, crew, dragon, the, vostok, was, the, soviet, union, s, first, crewed, space, capsule, the, first, human, spaceflight, was, vostok, 1, accomplished, on, april, 12, 1961, by, cosmonaut, yuri, gagarin, the, capsule, was, originally, designed, for, use, both, as, a, camera, platform, for, the, soviet, union, s, first, spy, satellite, program, zenit, and, as, a, crewed, spacecraft, this, dual, use, design, was, crucial, in, gaining, communist, party, support, for, the, program, the, design, used, a, spherical, reentry, module, with, a, biconic, descent, module, containing, attitude, control, thrusters, on, orbit, consumables, and, the, retro, rocket, for, orbit, termination, the, basic, design, has, remained, in, use, for, some, 40, years, gradually, adapted, for, a, range, of, other, uncrewed, satellites, it, was, a, single, seat, capsule, that, was, 4, 4, meters, long, and, 2, 4, meters, in, diameter, weighing, 4, 73, tonnes, at, launch, the, reentry, module, was, completely, covered, in, ablative, heat, shield, material, 2, 3, meters, 7, 5, ft, in, diameter, weighing, 2, 460, kilograms, 5, 420, lb, the, capsule, was, covered, with, a, nose, cone, to, maintain, a, low, drag, profile, for, launch, with, a, cylindrical, interior, cabin, approximately, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, in, diameter, nearly, perpendicular, to, the, capsule, s, longitudinal, axis, the, cosmonaut, sat, in, an, ejection, seat, with, a, separate, parachute, for, escape, during, a, launch, emergency, and, landing, during, a, normal, flight, the, capsule, had, its, own, parachute, for, landing, on, the, ground, although, official, sources, stated, that, gagarin, had, landed, inside, his, capsule, a, requirement, for, qualifying, as, a, first, crewed, spaceflight, under, international, aeronautical, federation, iaf, rules, it, was, later, revealed, that, all, vostok, cosmonauts, ejected, and, landed, separately, from, the, capsule, the, capsule, was, serviced, by, an, aft, facing, conical, equipment, module, 2, 25, meters, 7, 4, ft, long, by, 2, 43, meters, 8, 0, ft, weighing, 2, 270, kilograms, 5, 000, lb, containing, nitrogen, and, oxygen, breathing, gasses, batteries, fuel, attitude, control, thrusters, and, the, retrorocket, it, could, support, flights, as, long, as, ten, days, six, vostok, launches, were, successfully, conducted, the, last, two, pairs, in, concurrent, flights, the, longest, flight, was, just, short, of, five, days, on, vostok, 5, on, june, 14, 19, 1963, since, the, attitude, control, thrusters, were, located, in, the, instrument, module, which, was, discarded, immediately, prior, to, reentry, the, reentry, module, s, path, and, orientation, could, not, be, actively, controlled, this, meant, that, the, capsule, had, to, be, protected, from, reentry, heat, on, all, sides, determining, the, spherical, design, as, opposed, to, project, mercury, s, conical, design, which, allowed, for, maximum, volume, while, minimizing, the, heat, shield, diameter, during, reentry, the, heat, of, atmospheric, friction, is, so, great, that, air, molecules, around, the, capsule, are, ionized, creating, a, layer, of, plasma, around, the, capsule, which, blocks, radio, communication, with, the, ground, however, ionized, gases, in, the, plasma, layer, can, also, be, used, to, create, an, artificial, radio, window, allowing, communication, signals, to, be, transmitted, and, received, despite, the, interference, some, control, of, the, capsule, s, reentry, orientation, was, possible, by, offsetting, its, center, of, gravity, proper, orientation, with, the, cosmonaut, s, back, to, the, direction, of, flight, was, necessary, in, order, to, best, sustain, the, which, also, maximized, the, 8, to, 9, g, force, the, vostok, design, was, modified, to, permit, carrying, multi, cosmonaut, crews, and, flown, as, two, flights, of, the, voskhod, programme, the, cylindrical, interior, cabin, was, replaced, with, a, wider, rectangular, cabin, which, could, hold, either, three, cosmonauts, seated, abreast, voskhod, 1, or, two, cosmonauts, with, an, inflatable, airlock, in, between, them, to, permit, extravehicular, activity, voskhod, 2, a, backup, solid, fuel, retro, rocket, was, added, to, the, top, of, the, descent, module, vostok, s, ejection, seat, was, removed, to, save, space, thus, there, was, no, provision, for, crew, escape, in, the, event, of, a, launch, or, landing, emergency, the, complete, voskhod, spacecraft, weighed, 5, 682, kilograms, 12, 527, lb, lack, of, space, meant, that, the, crew, members, of, voskhod, 1, did, not, wear, space, suits, both, voskhod, 2, crew, members, wore, spacesuits, as, it, involved, an, eva, by, cosmonaut, alexei, leonov, an, airlock, was, needed, because, the, vehicle, s, electrical, and, environmental, systems, were, air, cooled, and, complete, capsule, depressurization, would, lead, to, overheating, the, airlock, weighed, 250, kg, 551, lb, 2, oz, was, 700, mm, 28, in, in, diameter, 770, mm, 30, in, high, when, collapsed, for, launch, when, extended, in, orbit, it, was, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, long, had, an, internal, diameter, of, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, and, an, external, diameter, of, 1, 2, m, 3, ft, 11, in, the, second, crew, member, wore, a, spacesuit, as, a, precaution, against, accidental, descent, module, depressurization, the, airlock, was, jettisoned, after, use, the, lack, of, ejection, seats, meant, that, the, voskhod, crew, would, return, to, earth, inside, their, spacecraft, unlike, the, vostok, cosmonauts, who, ejected, and, parachuted, down, separately, because, of, this, a, new, landing, system, was, developed, which, added, a, small, solid, fuel, rocket, to, the, parachute, lines, it, fired, as, the, descent, module, neared, touchdown, providing, a, softer, landing, the, mercury, program, was, the, united, states, first, crewed, space, program, it, ran, from, 1958, through, 1963, with, the, goal, of, putting, a, human, in, orbit, around, the, earth, and, returning, him, safely, the, program, used, a, small, capsule, attached, to, a, booster, rocket, to, achieve, orbit, the, development, of, the, mercury, capsule, began, in, earnest, after, nasa, selected, the, mcdonnell, aircraft, corporation, as, its, contractor, in, 1959, the, mercury, spacecraft, s, principal, designer, was, maxime, faget, who, started, research, for, human, spaceflight, during, the, time, of, the, naca, it, was, 10, 8, feet, 3, 3, m, long, and, 6, 0, feet, 1, 8, m, wide, with, the, launch, escape, system, added, the, overall, length, was, 25, 9, feet, 7, 9, m, with, 100, cubic, feet, 2, 8, m, 3, of, habitable, volume, the, capsule, was, just, large, enough, for, a, single, crew, member, inside, were, 120, controls, 55, electrical, switches, 30, fuses, and, 35, mechanical, levers, the, heaviest, spacecraft, mercury, atlas, 9, weighed, 3, 000, pounds, 1, 400, kg, fully, loaded, its, outer, skin, was, made, of, ren, 41, a, nickel, alloy, able, to, withstand, high, temperatures, the, spacecraft, was, cone, shaped, with, a, neck, at, the, narrow, end, it, had, a, convex, base, which, carried, a, heat, shield, item, 2, in, the, diagram, below, consisting, of, an, aluminum, honeycomb, covered, with, multiple, layers, of, fiberglass, strapped, to, it, was, a, retropack, 1, consisting, of, three, rockets, deployed, to, brake, the, spacecraft, during, reentry, between, these, were, three, minor, rockets, for, separating, the, spacecraft, from, the, launch, vehicle, at, orbital, insertion, the, straps, that, held, the, package, could, be, severed, when, it, was, no, longer, needed, next, to, the, heat, shield, was, the, pressurized, crew, compartment, 3, inside, an, astronaut, would, be, strapped, to, a, form, fitting, seat, with, instruments, in, front, of, him, and, with, his, back, to, the, heat, shield, underneath, the, seat, was, the, environmental, control, system, supplying, oxygen, and, heat, scrubbing, the, air, of, co, 2, vapor, and, odors, and, on, orbital, flights, collecting, urine, the, recovery, compartment, 4, at, the, narrow, end, of, the, spacecraft, contained, three, parachutes, a, drogue, to, stabilize, free, fall, and, two, main, chutes, a, primary, and, reserve, between, the, heat, shield, and, inner, wall, of, the, crew, compartment, was, a, landing, skirt, deployed, by, letting, down, the, heat, shield, before, landing, on, top, of, the, recovery, compartment, was, the, antenna, section, 5, containing, both, antennas, for, communication, and, scanners, for, guiding, spacecraft, orientation, attached, was, a, flap, used, to, ensure, the, spacecraft, was, faced, heat, shield, first, during, reentry, a, launch, escape, system, 6, was, mounted, to, the, narrow, end, of, the, spacecraft, containing, three, small, solid, fueled, rockets, which, could, be, fired, briefly, in, a, launch, failure, to, separate, the, capsule, safely, from, its, booster, it, would, deploy, the, capsule, s, parachute, for, a, landing, nearby, at, sea, see, also, mission, profile, for, details, the, mercury, spacecraft, did, not, have, an, on, board, computer, instead, relying, on, all, computation, for, reentry, to, be, calculated, by, computers, on, the, ground, with, their, results, retrofire, times, and, firing, attitude, then, transmitted, to, the, spacecraft, by, radio, while, in, flight, all, computer, systems, used, in, the, mercury, space, program, were, housed, in, nasa, facilities, on, earth, the, computer, systems, were, ibm, 701, computers, the, us, launched, its, first, mercury, astronaut, alan, shepard, on, a, suborbital, flight, almost, a, month, after, the, first, crewed, orbital, spaceflight, the, soviets, were, able, to, launch, a, second, vostok, on, a, one, day, flight, on, august, 6, before, the, us, finally, orbited, the, first, american, john, glenn, on, february, 20, 1962, the, united, states, launched, a, total, of, two, crewed, suborbital, mercury, capsules, and, four, crewed, orbital, capsules, with, the, longest, flight, mercury, atlas, 9, making, 22, orbits, and, lasting, 32, and, one, half, hours, many, components, in, the, capsule, itself, were, reachable, through, their, own, small, access, doors, unlike, mercury, gemini, used, completely, solid, state, electronics, and, its, modular, design, made, it, easy, to, repair, the, gemini, spacecraft, was, the, precursor, to, the, apollo, program, which, aimed, to, land, humans, on, the, moon, it, was, designed, to, test, new, techniques, for, orbital, rendezvous, and, docking, but, it, also, featured, improvements, in, life, support, systems, spacecraft, reentry, and, other, critical, areas, gemini, s, emergency, launch, escape, system, did, not, use, an, escape, tower, powered, by, a, solid, fuel, rocket, but, instead, used, aircraft, style, ejection, seats, the, tower, was, heavy, and, complicated, and, nasa, engineers, reasoned, that, they, could, do, away, with, it, as, the, titan, ii, s, hypergolic, propellants, would, burn, immediately, on, contact, a, titan, ii, booster, explosion, had, a, smaller, blast, effect, and, flame, than, on, the, cryogenically, fueled, atlas, and, saturn, ejection, seats, were, sufficient, to, separate, the, astronauts, from, a, malfunctioning, launch, vehicle, at, higher, altitudes, where, the, ejection, seats, could, not, be, used, the, astronauts, would, return, to, earth, inside, the, spacecraft, which, would, separate, from, the, launch, vehicle, the, main, proponent, of, using, ejection, seats, was, chamberlin, who, had, never, liked, the, mercury, escape, tower, and, wished, to, use, a, simpler, alternative, that, would, also, reduce, weight, he, reviewed, several, films, of, atlas, and, titan, ii, icbm, failures, which, he, used, to, estimate, the, approximate, size, of, a, fireball, produced, by, an, exploding, launch, vehicle, and, from, this, he, gauged, that, the, titan, ii, would, produce, a, much, smaller, explosion, thus, the, spacecraft, could, get, away, with, ejection, seats, maxime, faget, the, designer, of, the, mercury, les, was, on, the, other, hand, less, than, enthusiastic, about, this, setup, aside, from, the, possibility, of, the, ejection, seats, seriously, injuring, the, astronauts, they, would, also, only, be, usable, for, about, 40, seconds, after, liftoff, by, which, point, the, booster, would, be, attaining, mach, 1, speed, and, ejection, would, no, longer, be, possible, he, was, also, concerned, about, the, astronauts, being, launched, through, the, titan, s, exhaust, plume, if, they, ejected, in, flight, and, later, added, the, best, thing, about, gemini, was, that, they, never, had, to, make, an, escape, the, gemini, ejection, system, was, never, tested, with, the, gemini, cabin, pressurized, with, pure, oxygen, as, it, was, prior, to, launch, in, january, 1967, the, fatal, apollo, 1, fire, demonstrated, that, pressurizing, a, spacecraft, with, pure, oxygen, created, an, extremely, dangerous, fire, hazard, in, a, 1997, oral, history, astronaut, thomas, p, stafford, commented, on, the, gemini, 6, launch, abort, in, december, 1965, when, he, and, command, pilot, wally, schirra, nearly, ejected, from, the, spacecraft, so, it, turns, out, what, we, would, have, seen, had, we, had, to, do, that, would, have, been, two, roman, candles, going, out, because, we, were, 15, or, 16, psi, pure, oxygen, soaking, in, that, for, an, hour, and, a, half, you, remember, the, tragic, fire, we, had, at, the, cape, jesus, with, that, fire, going, off, and, that, it, would, have, burned, the, suits, everything, was, soaked, in, oxygen, so, thank, god, that, was, another, thing, nasa, never, tested, it, under, the, conditions, that, they, would, have, had, if, they, would, have, had, to, eject, they, did, have, some, tests, at, china, lake, where, they, had, a, simulated, mock, up, of, gemini, capsule, but, what, they, did, is, fill, it, full, of, nitrogen, they, didn, t, have, it, filled, full, of, oxygen, in, the, sled, test, they, had, gemini, was, the, first, astronaut, carrying, spacecraft, to, include, an, onboard, computer, the, gemini, guidance, computer, to, facilitate, management, and, control, of, mission, maneuvers, this, computer, sometimes, called, the, gemini, spacecraft, on, board, computer, obc, was, very, similar, to, the, saturn, launch, vehicle, digital, computer, the, gemini, guidance, computer, weighed, 58, 98, pounds, 26, 75, kg, its, core, memory, had, 4096, addresses, each, containing, a, 39, bit, word, composed, of, three, 13, bit, syllables, all, numeric, data, was, 26, bit, two, s, complement, integers, sometimes, used, as, fixed, point, numbers, either, stored, in, the, first, two, syllables, of, a, word, or, in, the, accumulator, instructions, always, with, a, 4, bit, opcode, and, 9, bits, of, operand, could, go, in, any, syllable, the, apollo, spacecraft, was, first, conceived, in, 1960, as, a, three, man, craft, to, follow, project, mercury, to, accomplish, several, types, of, mission, ferrying, astronauts, to, an, earth, orbiting, space, station, circumlunar, flight, or, a, moon, landing, nasa, solicited, feasibility, study, designs, from, several, companies, in, 1960, and, 1961, while, faget, and, the, space, task, group, worked, on, their, own, design, using, a, conical, blunt, body, capsule, command, module, supported, by, a, cylindrical, service, module, providing, electrical, power, and, propulsion, nasa, reviewed, the, entrants, designs, in, may, 1961, but, when, president, john, f, kennedy, proposed, a, national, effort, to, land, a, man, on, the, moon, during, the, 1960s, nasa, decided, to, reject, the, feasibility, studies, and, proceed, with, faget, s, design, focused, on, the, lunar, landing, mission, the, contract, to, build, apollo, was, awarded, to, north, american, aviation, the, main, apollo, spacecraft, was, built, in, two, segments, a, command, module, cm, and, a, service, module, sm, the, cm, was, 154, inches, 3, 91, m, in, diameter, and, 137, inches, 3, 48, m, high, with, a, mass, of, 5, 560, kilograms, 12, 260, lb, at, launch, the, service, module, was, 13, feet, 4, 0, m, long, with, a, total, command, service, module, csm, vehicle, length, of, 36, feet, 2, 5, inches, 11, 04, m, including, the, engine, bell, the, hypergolic, propellant, service, propulsion, engine, was, sized, at, 20, 500, pounds, force, 91, 000, n, to, lift, the, csm, off, the, lunar, surface, and, send, it, back, to, earth, using, a, direct, ascent, mission, profile, this, required, a, single, launch, vehicle, much, larger, than, the, saturn, v, or, else, multiple, saturn, v, launches, to, assemble, it, in, earth, orbit, before, sending, it, to, the, moon, early, on, the, direct, ascent, mission, profile, was, replaced, with, lunar, orbit, rendezvous, augmenting, the, csm, with, the, lunar, excursion, module, lm, to, ferry, two, astronauts, to, the, lunar, surface, this, reduced, the, net, spacecraft, mass, allowing, the, mission, to, be, launched, with, a, single, saturn, v, since, significant, development, work, had, started, on, the, design, it, was, decided, to, continue, with, the, existing, design, as, block, i, while, a, block, ii, version, capable, of, rendezvous, with, the, lem, would, be, developed, in, parallel, besides, addition, of, a, docking, tunnel, and, probe, block, ii, would, employ, equipment, improvements, based, on, lessons, learned, from, the, block, i, design, block, i, would, be, used, for, uncrewed, test, flights, and, a, limited, number, of, earth, orbit, crewed, flights, though, the, service, propulsion, engine, was, now, bigger, than, required, its, design, was, not, changed, since, significant, development, was, already, in, progress, however, the, propellant, tanks, were, downsized, slightly, to, reflect, the, modified, fuel, requirement, based, on, astronaut, preference, the, block, ii, cm, would, replace, the, two, piece, plug, door, hatch, cover, chosen, to, avoid, an, accidental, hatch, opening, such, as, had, happened, on, gus, grissom, s, mercury, redstone, 4, flight, with, a, one, piece, outward, opening, hatch, to, make, egress, easier, at, the, end, of, the, mission, the, mercury, gemini, practice, of, using, a, prelaunch, atmosphere, of, 16, 7, pounds, per, square, inch, 1, 150, mbar, pure, oxygen, proved, to, be, disastrous, in, combination, with, the, plug, door, hatch, design, while, participating, in, a, pre, launch, test, on, the, pad, on, january, 27, 1967, in, preparation, for, the, first, crewed, launch, in, february, the, entire, crew, of, apollo, 1, grissom, edward, h, white, and, roger, chaffee, were, killed, in, a, fire, that, swept, through, the, cabin, the, plug, door, made, it, impossible, for, the, astronauts, to, escape, or, be, removed, before, their, deaths, an, investigation, revealed, the, fire, was, probably, started, by, a, spark, from, a, frayed, wire, and, fed, by, combustible, materials, that, should, not, have, been, in, the, cabin, the, crewed, flight, program, was, delayed, while, design, changes, were, made, to, the, block, ii, spacecraft, to, replace, the, pure, oxygen, pre, launch, atmosphere, with, an, air, like, nitrogen, oxygen, mixture, eliminate, combustible, materials, from, the, cabin, and, the, astronauts, space, suits, and, seal, all, electrical, wiring, and, corrosive, coolant, lines, the, block, ii, spacecraft, weighed, 63, 500, pounds, 28, 800, kg, fully, fueled, and, was, used, in, four, crewed, earth, and, lunar, orbital, test, flights, and, seven, crewed, lunar, landing, missions, a, modified, version, of, the, spacecraft, was, also, used, to, ferry, three, crews, to, the, skylab, space, station, and, the, apollo, soyuz, test, project, mission, which, docked, with, a, soviet, soyuz, spacecraft, the, apollo, spacecraft, was, retired, after, 1974, in, 1963, korolev, first, proposed, the, three, man, soyuz, spacecraft, for, use, in, earth, orbit, assembly, of, a, lunar, exploration, mission, he, was, pressured, by, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, to, postpone, development, of, soyuz, to, work, on, voskhod, and, later, allowed, to, develop, soyuz, for, space, station, and, lunar, exploration, missions, he, employed, a, small, lightweight, bell, shaped, reentry, capsule, with, an, orbital, crew, module, attached, to, its, nose, containing, the, bulk, of, the, mission, living, space, the, service, module, would, use, two, panels, of, electric, solar, cells, for, power, generation, and, contained, a, propulsion, system, engine, the, 7k, ok, model, designed, for, earth, orbit, used, a, 2, 810, kilogram, 6, 190, lb, reentry, module, measuring, 2, 17, meters, 7, 1, ft, in, diameter, by, 2, 24, meters, 7, 3, ft, long, with, an, interior, volume, of, 4, 00, cubic, meters, 141, cu, ft, the, 1, 100, kilogram, 2, 400, lb, spheroidal, orbital, module, measured, 2, 25, meters, 7, 4, ft, in, diameter, by, 3, 45, meters, 11, 3, ft, long, with, a, docking, probe, with, an, interior, volume, of, 5, 00, cubic, meters, 177, cu, ft, the, total, spacecraft, mass, was, 6, 560, kilograms, 14, 460, lb, ten, of, these, craft, flew, crewed, after, korolev, s, death, from, 1967, to, 1971, the, first, soyuz, 1, and, last, soyuz, 11, resulted, in, the, first, in, space, fatalities, korolev, had, developed, a, 9, 850, kilogram, 21, 720, lb, 7k, lok, variant, for, use, in, the, lunar, mission, but, this, was, never, flown, crewed, the, russians, continued, to, develop, and, fly, the, soyuz, to, this, day, space, capsules, have, also, been, used, for, scientific, research, and, experimentation, in, space, for, example, the, chinese, shenzhou, spacecraft, has, carried, out, experiments, in, life, sciences, material, sciences, fluid, dynamics, and, space, environment, monitoring, the, prc, developed, its, shenzhou, spacecraft, in, the, 1990s, based, on, the, same, concept, orbital, reentry, and, service, modules, as, soyuz, its, first, uncrewed, test, flight, was, in, 1999, and, the, first, crewed, flight, in, october, 2003, carried, yang, liwei, for, 14, earth, orbits, the, seven, seat, spacex, dragon, 2, capsule, first, launched, crew, to, the, international, space, station, on, 30, may, 2020, on, the, demo, 2, mission, for, nasa, although, originally, envisaged, as, a, development, of, spacex, s, uncrewed, dragon, capsule, which, was, used, for, the, nasa, commercial, resupply, services, contract, the, demands, of, crewed, spaceflight, resulted, in, a, significantly, redesigned, vehicle, with, limited, commonality, the, dragon, capsule, was, designed, to, be, reusable, in, fact, spacex, has, flown, the, same, dragon, capsule, to, the, international, space, station, multiple, times, with, the, first, successful, reuse, occurring, in, june, 2017, the, six, seat, blue, origin, developed, new, shepard, crew, capsule, is, a, suborbital, crewed, spacecraft, designed, for, human, tended, research, and, space, tourism, the, capsule, can, also, fly, uncrewed, carrying, a, larger, number, of, payloads, and, experiments
