a, camera, is, an, instrument, used, to, capture, and, store, images, and, videos, either, digitally, via, an, electronic, image, sensor, or, chemically, via, a, light, sensitive, material, such, as, photographic, film, as, a, pivotal, technology, in, the, fields, of, photography, and, videography, cameras, have, played, a, significant, role, in, the, progression, of, visual, arts, media, entertainment, surveillance, and, scientific, research, the, invention, of, the, camera, dates, back, to, the, 19th, century, and, has, since, evolved, with, advancements, in, technology, leading, to, a, vast, array, of, types, and, models, in, the, 21st, century, cameras, function, through, a, combination, of, multiple, mechanical, components, and, principles, these, include, exposure, control, which, regulates, the, amount, of, light, reaching, the, sensor, or, film, the, lens, which, focuses, the, light, the, viewfinder, which, allows, the, user, to, preview, the, scene, and, the, film, or, sensor, which, captures, the, image, several, types, of, cameras, exist, each, suited, to, specific, uses, and, offering, unique, capabilities, single, lens, reflex, slr, cameras, provide, real, time, exact, imaging, through, the, lens, large, format, and, medium, format, cameras, offer, higher, image, resolution, and, are, often, used, in, professional, and, artistic, photography, compact, cameras, known, for, their, portability, and, simplicity, are, popular, in, consumer, photography, rangefinder, cameras, with, separate, viewing, and, imaging, systems, were, historically, widely, used, in, photojournalism, motion, picture, cameras, are, specialized, for, filming, cinematic, content, while, digital, cameras, which, became, prevalent, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, use, electronic, sensors, to, capture, and, store, images, the, rapid, development, of, smartphone, camera, technology, in, the, 21st, century, has, blurred, the, lines, between, dedicated, cameras, and, multifunctional, devices, profoundly, influencing, how, society, creates, shares, and, consumes, visual, content, beginning, with, the, use, of, the, camera, obscura, and, transitioning, to, complex, photographic, cameras, the, evolution, of, the, technology, in, the, 19th, century, was, driven, by, pioneers, like, thomas, wedgwood, nic, phore, ni, pce, and, henry, fox, talbot, first, using, the, camera, obscura, for, chemical, experiments, they, ultimately, created, cameras, specifically, for, chemical, photography, and, later, reduced, the, camera, s, size, and, optimized, lens, configurations, the, introduction, of, the, daguerreotype, process, in, 1839, facilitated, commercial, camera, manufacturing, with, various, producers, contributing, diverse, designs, as, camera, manufacturing, became, a, specialized, trade, in, the, 1850s, designs, and, sizes, were, standardized, the, latter, half, of, the, century, witnessed, the, advent, of, dry, plates, and, roll, film, prompting, a, shift, towards, smaller, and, more, cost, effective, cameras, epitomized, by, the, original, kodak, camera, first, produced, in, 1888, this, period, also, saw, significant, advancements, in, lens, technology, and, the, emergence, of, color, photography, leading, to, a, surge, in, camera, ownership, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, continued, miniaturization, and, the, integration, of, new, manufacturing, materials, after, world, war, i, germany, took, the, lead, in, camera, development, spearheading, industry, consolidation, and, producing, precision, made, cameras, the, industry, saw, significant, product, launches, such, as, the, leica, camera, and, the, contax, which, were, enabled, by, advancements, in, film, and, lens, designs, additionally, there, was, a, marked, increase, in, accessibility, to, cinematography, for, amateurs, with, eastman, kodak, s, production, of, the, first, 16, mm, and, 8, mm, reversal, safety, films, the, world, war, ii, era, saw, a, focus, on, the, development, of, specialized, aerial, reconnaissance, and, instrument, recording, equipment, even, as, the, overall, pace, of, non, military, camera, innovation, slowed, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, japanese, manufacturers, in, particular, advanced, camera, technology, from, the, introduction, of, the, affordable, ricohflex, iii, tlr, in, 1952, to, the, first, 35mm, slr, with, automatic, exposure, the, olympus, autoeye, in, 1960, new, designs, and, features, continuously, emerged, electronics, became, integral, to, camera, design, in, the, 1970s, evident, in, models, like, polaroid, s, sx, 70, and, canon, s, ae, 1, transition, to, digital, photography, marked, the, late, 20th, century, culminating, in, digital, camera, sales, surpassing, film, cameras, in, the, united, states, by, 2003, in, contrast, the, film, camera, industry, in, the, uk, western, europe, and, the, usa, declined, during, this, period, while, manufacturing, continued, in, the, ussr, german, democratic, republic, and, china, often, mimicking, western, designs, the, 21st, century, witnessed, the, mass, adoption, of, digital, cameras, and, significant, improvements, in, sensor, technology, a, major, revolution, came, with, the, incorporation, of, cameras, into, smartphones, making, photography, a, commonplace, activity, the, century, also, marked, the, rise, of, computational, photography, using, algorithms, and, ai, to, enhance, image, quality, features, like, low, light, and, hdr, photography, optical, image, stabilization, and, depth, sensing, became, common, in, smartphone, cameras, most, cameras, capture, light, from, the, visible, spectrum, while, specialized, cameras, capture, other, portions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, such, as, infrared, vii, all, cameras, use, the, same, basic, design, light, enters, an, enclosed, box, through, a, converging, or, convex, lens, and, an, image, is, recorded, on, a, light, sensitive, medium, a, shutter, mechanism, controls, the, length, of, time, that, light, enters, the, camera, 1182, 1183, most, cameras, also, have, a, viewfinder, which, shows, the, scene, to, be, recorded, along, with, means, to, adjust, various, combinations, of, focus, aperture, and, shutter, speed, 4, light, enters, the, camera, through, an, aperture, an, opening, adjusted, by, overlapping, plates, called, the, aperture, ring, typically, located, in, the, lens, this, opening, can, be, widened, or, narrowed, to, alter, the, amount, of, light, that, strikes, the, film, or, sensor, the, size, of, the, aperture, can, be, set, manually, by, rotating, the, lens, or, adjusting, a, dial, or, automatically, based, on, readings, from, an, internal, light, meter, as, the, aperture, is, adjusted, the, opening, expands, and, contracts, in, increments, called, f, stops, the, smaller, the, f, stop, the, more, light, is, allowed, to, enter, the, lens, increasing, the, exposure, typically, f, stops, range, from, f, 1, 4, to, f, 32, in, standard, increments, 1, 4, 2, 2, 8, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, 22, and, 32, the, light, entering, the, camera, is, halved, with, each, increasing, increment, the, wider, opening, at, lower, f, stops, narrows, the, range, of, focus, so, the, background, is, blurry, while, the, foreground, is, in, focus, this, depth, of, field, increases, as, the, aperture, closes, a, narrow, aperture, results, in, a, high, depth, of, field, meaning, that, objects, at, many, different, distances, from, the, camera, will, appear, to, be, in, focus, what, is, acceptably, in, focus, is, determined, by, the, circle, of, confusion, the, photographic, technique, the, equipment, in, use, and, the, degree, of, magnification, expected, of, the, final, image, the, shutter, along, with, the, aperture, is, one, of, two, ways, to, control, the, amount, of, light, entering, the, camera, the, shutter, determines, the, duration, that, the, light, sensitive, surface, is, exposed, to, light, the, shutter, opens, light, enters, the, camera, and, exposes, the, film, or, sensor, to, light, and, then, the, shutter, closes, there, are, two, types, of, mechanical, shutters, the, leaf, type, shutter, and, the, focal, plane, shutter, the, leaf, type, uses, a, circular, iris, diaphragm, maintained, under, spring, tension, inside, or, just, behind, the, lens, that, rapidly, opens, and, closes, when, the, shutter, is, released, more, commonly, a, focal, plane, shutter, is, used, this, shutter, operates, close, to, the, film, plane, and, employs, metal, plates, or, cloth, curtains, with, an, opening, that, passes, across, the, light, sensitive, surface, the, curtains, or, plates, have, an, opening, that, is, pulled, across, the, film, plane, during, exposure, the, focal, plane, shutter, is, typically, used, in, single, lens, reflex, slr, cameras, since, covering, the, film, rather, than, blocking, the, light, passing, through, the, lens, allows, the, photographer, to, view, the, image, through, the, lens, at, all, times, except, during, the, exposure, itself, covering, the, film, also, facilitates, removing, the, lens, from, a, loaded, camera, as, many, slrs, have, interchangeable, lenses, a, digital, camera, may, use, a, mechanical, or, electronic, shutter, the, latter, of, which, is, common, in, smartphone, cameras, electronic, shutters, either, record, data, from, the, entire, sensor, simultaneously, a, global, shutter, or, record, the, data, line, by, line, across, the, sensor, a, rolling, shutter, in, movie, cameras, a, rotary, shutter, opens, and, closes, in, sync, with, the, advancement, of, each, frame, of, film, the, duration, for, which, the, shutter, is, open, is, called, the, shutter, speed, or, exposure, time, typical, exposure, times, can, range, from, one, second, to, 1, 1, 000, of, a, second, though, longer, and, shorter, durations, are, not, uncommon, in, the, early, stages, of, photography, exposures, were, often, several, minutes, long, these, long, exposure, times, often, resulted, in, blurry, images, as, a, single, object, is, recorded, in, multiple, places, across, a, single, image, for, the, duration, of, the, exposure, to, prevent, this, shorter, exposure, times, can, be, used, very, short, exposure, times, can, capture, fast, moving, action, and, eliminate, motion, blur, however, shorter, exposure, times, require, more, light, to, produce, a, properly, exposed, image, so, shortening, the, exposure, time, is, not, always, possible, like, aperture, settings, exposure, times, increment, in, powers, of, two, the, two, settings, determine, the, exposure, value, ev, a, measure, of, how, much, light, is, recorded, during, the, exposure, there, is, a, direct, relationship, between, the, exposure, times, and, aperture, settings, so, that, if, the, exposure, time, is, lengthened, one, step, but, the, aperture, opening, is, also, narrowed, one, step, then, the, amount, of, light, that, contacts, the, film, or, sensor, is, the, same, in, most, modern, cameras, the, amount, of, light, entering, the, camera, is, measured, using, a, built, in, light, meter, or, exposure, meter, taken, through, the, lens, called, ttl, metering, these, readings, are, taken, using, a, panel, of, light, sensitive, semiconductors, they, are, used, to, calculate, optimal, exposure, settings, these, settings, are, typically, determined, automatically, as, the, reading, is, used, by, the, camera, s, microprocessor, the, reading, from, the, light, meter, is, incorporated, with, aperture, settings, exposure, times, and, film, or, sensor, sensitivity, to, calculate, the, optimal, exposure, light, meters, typically, average, the, light, in, a, scene, to, 18, middle, gray, more, advanced, cameras, are, more, nuanced, in, their, metering, weighing, the, center, of, the, frame, more, heavily, center, weighted, metering, considering, the, differences, in, light, across, the, image, matrix, metering, or, allowing, the, photographer, to, take, a, light, reading, at, a, specific, point, within, the, image, spot, metering, a, camera, lens, is, an, assembly, of, multiple, optical, elements, typically, made, from, high, quality, glass, its, primary, function, is, to, focus, light, onto, a, camera, s, film, or, digital, sensor, thereby, producing, an, image, this, process, significantly, influences, image, quality, the, overall, appearance, of, the, photo, and, which, parts, of, the, scene, are, brought, into, focus, a, camera, lens, is, constructed, from, a, series, of, lens, elements, small, pieces, of, glass, arranged, to, form, an, image, accurately, on, the, light, sensitive, surface, each, element, is, designed, to, reduce, optical, aberrations, or, distortions, such, as, chromatic, aberration, a, failure, of, the, lens, to, focus, all, colors, at, the, same, point, vignetting, darkening, of, image, corners, and, distortion, bending, or, warping, of, the, image, the, degree, of, these, distortions, can, vary, depending, on, the, subject, of, the, photo, the, focal, length, of, the, lens, measured, in, millimeters, plays, a, critical, role, as, it, determines, how, much, of, the, scene, the, camera, can, capture, and, how, large, the, objects, appear, wide, angle, lenses, provide, a, broad, view, of, the, scene, while, telephoto, lenses, capture, a, narrower, view, but, magnify, the, objects, the, focal, length, also, influences, the, ease, of, taking, clear, pictures, handheld, with, longer, lengths, making, it, more, challenging, to, avoid, blur, from, small, camera, movements, two, primary, types, of, lenses, include, zoom, and, prime, lenses, a, zoom, lens, allows, for, changing, its, focal, length, within, a, certain, range, providing, the, convenience, of, adjusting, the, scene, capture, without, moving, the, camera, or, changing, the, lens, a, prime, lens, in, contrast, has, a, fixed, focal, length, while, less, flexible, prime, lenses, often, provide, superior, image, quality, are, typically, lighter, and, perform, better, in, low, light, focus, involves, adjusting, the, lens, elements, to, sharpen, the, image, of, the, subject, at, various, distances, the, focus, is, adjusted, through, the, focus, ring, on, the, lens, which, moves, the, lens, elements, closer, or, further, from, the, sensor, autofocus, is, a, feature, included, in, many, lenses, which, uses, a, motor, within, the, lens, to, adjust, the, focus, quickly, and, precisely, based, on, the, lens, s, detection, of, contrast, or, phase, differences, this, feature, can, be, enabled, or, disabled, using, switches, on, the, lens, body, advanced, lenses, may, include, mechanical, image, stabilization, systems, that, move, lens, elements, or, the, image, sensor, itself, to, counteract, camera, shake, especially, beneficial, in, low, light, conditions, or, at, slow, shutter, speeds, lens, hoods, filters, and, caps, are, accessories, used, alongside, a, lens, to, enhance, image, quality, protect, the, lens, or, achieve, specific, effects, the, camera, s, viewfinder, provides, a, real, time, approximation, of, what, will, be, captured, by, the, sensor, or, film, it, assists, photographers, in, aligning, focusing, and, adjusting, the, composition, lighting, and, exposure, of, their, shots, enhancing, the, accuracy, of, the, final, image, viewfinders, fall, into, two, primary, categories, optical, and, electronic, optical, viewfinders, commonly, found, in, single, lens, reflex, slr, cameras, use, a, system, of, mirrors, or, prisms, to, reflect, light, from, the, lens, to, the, viewfinder, providing, a, clear, real, time, view, of, the, scene, electronic, viewfinders, typical, in, mirrorless, cameras, project, an, electronic, image, onto, a, small, display, offering, a, wider, range, of, information, such, as, live, exposure, previews, and, histograms, albeit, at, the, cost, of, potential, lag, and, higher, battery, consumption, specialized, viewfinder, systems, exist, for, specific, applications, like, subminiature, cameras, for, spying, or, underwater, photography, parallax, error, resulting, from, misalignment, between, the, viewfinder, and, lens, axes, can, cause, inaccurate, representations, of, the, subject, s, position, while, negligible, with, distant, subjects, this, error, becomes, prominent, with, closer, ones, some, viewfinders, incorporate, parallax, compensating, devices, to, mitigate, that, issue, image, capture, in, a, camera, occurs, when, light, strikes, a, light, sensitive, surface, photographic, film, or, a, digital, sensor, housed, within, the, camera, body, the, film, or, sensor, records, the, light, s, pattern, when, the, shutter, is, briefly, opened, to, allow, light, to, pass, during, the, exposure, loading, film, into, a, film, camera, is, a, manual, process, the, film, typically, housed, in, a, cartridge, is, loaded, into, a, designated, slot, in, the, camera, one, end, of, the, film, strip, the, film, leader, is, manually, threaded, onto, a, take, up, spool, once, the, back, of, the, camera, is, closed, the, film, advance, lever, or, knob, is, used, to, ensure, the, film, is, correctly, placed, the, photographer, then, winds, the, film, either, manually, or, automatically, depending, on, the, camera, to, position, a, blank, portion, of, the, film, in, the, path, of, the, light, each, time, a, photo, is, taken, the, film, advance, mechanism, moves, the, exposed, film, out, of, the, way, bringing, a, new, unexposed, section, of, film, into, position, for, the, next, shot, the, film, must, be, advanced, after, each, shot, to, prevent, double, exposure, where, the, same, section, of, film, is, exposed, to, light, twice, resulting, in, overlapped, images, once, all, frames, on, the, film, roll, have, been, exposed, the, film, is, rewound, back, into, the, cartridge, ready, to, be, removed, from, the, camera, for, developing, in, digital, cameras, sensors, typically, comprise, charge, coupled, devices, ccds, or, complementary, metal, oxide, semiconductor, cmos, chips, both, of, which, convert, incoming, light, into, electrical, charges, to, form, digital, images, ccd, sensors, though, power, intensive, are, recognized, for, their, excellent, light, sensitivity, and, image, quality, conversely, cmos, sensors, offer, individual, pixel, readouts, leading, to, less, power, consumption, and, faster, frame, rates, with, their, image, quality, having, improved, significantly, over, time, digital, cameras, convert, light, into, electronic, data, that, can, be, directly, processed, and, stored, the, volume, of, data, generated, is, dictated, by, the, sensor, s, size, and, properties, necessitating, storage, media, such, as, compact, flash, memory, sticks, and, sd, secure, digital, cards, modern, digital, cameras, typically, feature, a, built, in, monitor, for, immediate, image, review, and, adjustments, digital, images, are, also, more, readily, handled, and, manipulated, by, computers, offering, a, significant, advantage, in, terms, of, flexibility, and, post, processing, potential, over, traditional, film, a, flash, provides, a, short, burst, of, bright, light, during, exposure, and, is, a, commonly, used, artificial, light, source, in, photography, most, modern, flash, systems, use, a, battery, powered, high, voltage, discharge, through, a, gas, filled, tube, to, generate, bright, light, for, a, very, short, time, 1, 1, 000, of, a, second, or, less, many, flash, units, measure, the, light, reflected, from, the, flash, to, help, determine, the, appropriate, duration, of, the, flash, when, the, flash, is, attached, directly, to, the, camera, typically, in, a, slot, at, the, top, of, the, camera, the, flash, shoe, or, hot, shoe, or, through, a, cable, activating, the, shutter, on, the, camera, triggers, the, flash, and, the, camera, s, internal, light, meter, can, help, determine, the, duration, of, the, flash, additional, flash, equipment, can, include, a, light, diffuser, mount, and, stand, reflector, soft, box, trigger, and, cord, accessories, for, cameras, are, mainly, used, for, care, protection, special, effects, and, functions, large, format, cameras, use, special, equipment, that, includes, a, magnifier, loupe, view, finder, angle, finder, and, focusing, rail, truck, some, professional, slrs, can, be, provided, with, interchangeable, finders, for, eye, level, or, waist, level, focusing, focusing, screens, eyecup, data, backs, motor, drives, for, film, transportation, or, external, battery, packs, in, photography, the, single, lens, reflex, camera, slr, is, provided, with, a, mirror, to, redirect, light, from, the, lens, to, the, viewfinder, prior, to, releasing, the, shutter, for, composing, and, focusing, an, image, when, the, shutter, is, released, the, mirror, swings, up, and, away, allowing, the, exposure, of, the, photographic, medium, and, instantly, returns, after, the, exposure, is, finished, no, slr, camera, before, 1954, had, this, feature, although, the, mirror, on, some, early, slr, cameras, was, entirely, operated, by, the, force, exerted, on, the, shutter, release, and, only, returned, when, the, finger, pressure, was, released, the, asahiflex, ii, released, by, japanese, company, asahi, pentax, in, 1954, was, the, world, s, first, slr, camera, with, an, instant, return, mirror, in, the, single, lens, reflex, camera, the, photographer, sees, the, scene, through, the, camera, lens, this, avoids, the, problem, of, parallax, which, occurs, when, the, viewfinder, or, viewing, lens, is, separated, from, the, taking, lens, single, lens, reflex, cameras, have, been, made, in, several, formats, including, sheet, film, 5x7, and, 4x5, roll, film, 220, 120, taking, 8, 10, 12, or, 16, photographs, on, a, 120, roll, and, twice, that, number, of, a, 220, film, these, correspond, to, 6x9, 6x7, 6x6, and, 6x4, 5, respectively, all, dimensions, in, cm, notable, manufacturers, of, large, format, and, roll, film, slr, cameras, include, bronica, graflex, hasselblad, seagull, mamiya, and, pentax, however, the, most, common, format, of, slr, cameras, has, been, 35, mm, and, subsequently, the, migration, to, digital, slr, cameras, using, almost, identical, sized, bodies, and, sometimes, using, the, same, lens, systems, almost, all, slr, cameras, use, a, front, surfaced, mirror, in, the, optical, path, to, direct, the, light, from, the, lens, via, a, viewing, screen, and, pentaprism, to, the, eyepiece, at, the, time, of, exposure, the, mirror, is, flipped, up, out, of, the, light, path, before, the, shutter, opens, some, early, cameras, experimented, with, other, methods, of, providing, through, the, lens, viewing, including, the, use, of, a, semi, transparent, pellicle, as, in, the, canon, pellix, and, others, with, a, small, periscope, such, as, in, the, corfield, periflex, series, the, large, format, camera, taking, sheet, film, is, a, direct, successor, of, the, early, plate, cameras, and, remained, in, use, for, high, quality, photography, and, technical, architectural, and, industrial, photography, there, are, three, common, types, the, view, camera, with, its, monorail, and, field, camera, variants, and, the, press, camera, they, have, extensible, bellows, with, the, lens, and, shutter, mounted, on, a, lens, plate, at, the, front, backs, taking, roll, film, and, later, digital, backs, are, available, in, addition, to, the, standard, dark, slide, back, these, cameras, have, a, wide, range, of, movements, allowing, very, close, control, of, focus, and, perspective, composition, and, focusing, are, done, on, view, cameras, by, viewing, a, ground, glass, screen, which, is, replaced, by, the, film, to, make, the, exposure, they, are, suitable, for, static, subjects, only, and, are, slow, to, use, the, earliest, cameras, produced, in, significant, numbers, were, plate, cameras, using, sensitized, glass, plates, light, entered, a, lens, mounted, on, a, lens, board, which, was, separated, from, the, plate, by, extendible, bellows, there, were, simple, box, cameras, for, glass, plates, but, also, single, lens, reflex, cameras, with, interchangeable, lenses, and, even, for, color, photography, autochrome, lumi, re, many, of, these, cameras, had, controls, to, raise, lower, and, tilt, the, lens, forwards, or, backward, to, control, perspective, focusing, of, these, plate, cameras, was, by, the, use, of, a, ground, glass, screen, at, the, point, of, focus, because, lens, design, only, allowed, rather, small, aperture, lenses, the, image, on, the, ground, glass, screen, was, faint, and, most, photographers, had, a, dark, cloth, to, cover, their, heads, to, allow, focusing, and, composition, to, be, carried, out, more, quickly, when, focus, and, composition, were, satisfactory, the, ground, glass, screen, was, removed, and, a, sensitized, plate, was, put, in, its, place, protected, by, a, dark, slide, to, make, the, exposure, the, dark, decline, was, carefully, slid, out, and, the, shutter, opened, and, then, closed, and, the, dark, fall, replaced, glass, plates, were, later, replaced, by, sheet, film, in, a, dark, slide, for, sheet, film, adapter, sleeves, were, made, to, allow, sheet, film, to, be, used, in, plate, holders, in, addition, to, the, ground, glass, a, simple, optical, viewfinder, was, often, fitted, medium, format, cameras, have, a, film, size, between, the, large, format, cameras, and, smaller, 35, mm, cameras, typically, these, systems, use, 120, or, 220, roll, film, the, most, common, image, sizes, are, 6, 4, 5, cm, 6, 6, cm, and, 6, 7, cm, the, older, 6, 9, cm, is, rarely, used, the, designs, of, this, kind, of, camera, show, greater, variation, than, their, larger, brethren, ranging, from, monorail, systems, through, the, classic, hasselblad, model, with, separate, backs, to, smaller, rangefinder, cameras, there, are, even, compact, amateur, cameras, available, in, this, format, twin, lens, reflex, cameras, used, a, pair, of, nearly, identical, lenses, one, to, form, the, image, and, one, as, a, viewfinder, the, lenses, were, arranged, with, the, viewing, lens, immediately, above, the, taking, lens, the, viewing, lens, projects, an, image, onto, a, viewing, screen, which, can, be, seen, from, above, some, manufacturers, such, as, mamiya, also, provided, a, reflex, head, to, attach, to, the, viewing, screen, to, allow, the, camera, to, be, held, to, the, eye, when, in, use, the, advantage, of, a, tlr, was, that, it, could, be, easily, focused, using, the, viewing, screen, and, that, under, most, circumstances, the, view, seen, on, the, viewing, screen, was, identical, to, that, recorded, on, film, at, close, distances, however, parallax, errors, were, encountered, and, some, cameras, also, included, an, indicator, to, show, what, part, of, the, composition, would, be, excluded, some, tlrs, had, interchangeable, lenses, but, as, these, had, to, be, paired, lenses, they, were, relatively, heavy, and, did, not, provide, the, range, of, focal, lengths, that, the, slr, could, support, most, tlrs, used, 120, or, 220, films, some, used, the, smaller, 127, films, after, exposure, every, photograph, is, taken, through, pinch, rollers, inside, the, instant, camera, thereby, the, developer, paste, contained, in, the, paper, sandwich, is, distributed, on, the, image, after, a, minute, the, cover, sheet, just, needs, to, be, removed, and, one, gets, a, single, original, positive, image, with, a, fixed, format, with, some, systems, it, was, also, possible, to, create, an, instant, image, negative, from, which, then, could, be, made, copies, in, the, photo, lab, the, ultimate, development, was, the, sx, 70, system, of, polaroid, in, which, a, row, of, ten, shots, engine, driven, could, be, made, without, having, to, remove, any, cover, sheets, from, the, picture, there, were, instant, cameras, for, a, variety, of, formats, as, well, as, adapters, for, instant, film, use, in, medium, and, large, format, cameras, subminiature, cameras, were, first, produced, in, the, twentieth, century, and, use, film, significantly, smaller, than, 35mm, the, expensive, 8, 11mm, minox, the, only, type, of, camera, produced, by, the, company, from, 1937, to, 1976, became, very, widely, known, and, was, often, used, for, espionage, the, minox, company, later, also, produced, larger, cameras, later, inexpensive, subminiatures, were, made, for, general, use, some, using, rewound, 16, mm, cine, film, image, quality, with, these, small, film, sizes, was, limited, the, introduction, of, films, enabled, the, existing, designs, for, plate, cameras, to, be, made, much, smaller, and, for, the, baseplate, to, be, hinged, so, that, it, could, be, folded, up, compressing, the, bellows, these, designs, were, very, compact, and, small, models, were, dubbed, vest, pocket, cameras, one, of, the, smallest, and, best, selling, cameras, was, the, vest, pocket, kodak, sold, in, two, generations, between, 1912, and, 1934, folding, roll, film, cameras, were, preceded, by, folding, plate, cameras, more, compact, than, other, designs, box, cameras, were, introduced, as, budget, level, cameras, and, had, few, if, any, controls, the, original, box, brownie, models, had, a, small, reflex, viewfinder, mounted, on, the, top, of, the, camera, and, had, no, aperture, or, focusing, controls, and, just, a, simple, shutter, later, models, such, as, the, brownie, 127, had, larger, direct, view, optical, viewfinders, together, with, a, curved, film, path, to, reduce, the, impact, of, deficiencies, in, the, lens, as, camera, lens, technology, developed, and, wide, aperture, lenses, became, more, common, rangefinder, cameras, were, introduced, to, make, focusing, more, precise, early, rangefinders, had, two, separate, viewfinder, windows, one, of, which, is, linked, to, the, focusing, mechanisms, and, moved, right, or, left, as, the, focusing, ring, is, turned, the, two, separate, images, are, brought, together, on, a, ground, glass, viewing, screen, when, vertical, lines, in, the, object, being, photographed, meet, exactly, in, the, combined, image, the, object, is, in, focus, a, normal, composition, viewfinder, is, also, provided, later, the, viewfinder, and, rangefinder, were, combined, many, rangefinder, cameras, had, interchangeable, lenses, each, lens, requiring, its, range, and, viewfinder, linkages, rangefinder, cameras, were, produced, in, half, and, full, frame, 35, mm, and, roll, film, medium, format, a, movie, camera, or, a, video, camera, operates, similarly, to, a, still, camera, except, it, records, a, series, of, static, images, in, rapid, succession, commonly, at, a, rate, of, 24, frames, per, second, when, the, images, are, combined, and, displayed, in, order, the, illusion, of, motion, is, achieved, 4, cameras, that, capture, many, images, in, sequence, are, known, as, movie, cameras, or, as, cine, cameras, in, europe, those, designed, for, single, images, are, still, cameras, however, these, categories, overlap, as, still, cameras, are, often, used, to, capture, moving, images, in, special, effects, work, and, many, modern, cameras, can, quickly, switch, between, still, and, motion, recording, modes, a, cin, camera, or, movie, camera, takes, a, rapid, sequence, of, photographs, on, an, image, sensor, or, strips, of, film, in, contrast, to, a, still, camera, which, captures, a, single, snapshot, at, a, time, the, cin, camera, takes, a, series, of, images, each, called, a, frame, through, the, use, of, an, intermittent, mechanism, the, frames, are, later, played, back, in, a, cin, projector, at, a, specific, speed, called, the, frame, rate, number, of, frames, per, second, while, viewing, a, person, s, visual, system, merge, the, separate, pictures, to, create, the, illusion, of, motion, the, first, cin, camera, was, built, around, 1888, and, by, 1890, several, types, were, being, manufactured, the, standard, film, size, for, cin, cameras, was, quickly, established, as, 35mm, film, and, this, remained, in, use, until, the, transition, to, digital, cinematography, other, professional, standard, formats, include, 70, mm, film, and, 16, mm, film, whilst, amateur, filmmakers, used, 9, 5, mm, film, 8, mm, film, or, standard, 8, and, super, 8, before, the, move, into, digital, format, the, size, and, complexity, of, cin, cameras, vary, greatly, depending, on, the, uses, required, of, the, camera, some, professional, equipment, is, very, large, and, too, heavy, to, be, handheld, whilst, some, amateur, cameras, were, designed, to, be, very, small, and, light, for, single, handed, operation, a, professional, video, camera, often, called, a, television, camera, even, though, the, use, has, spread, beyond, television, is, a, high, end, device, for, creating, electronic, moving, images, as, opposed, to, a, movie, camera, that, earlier, recorded, the, images, on, film, originally, developed, for, use, in, television, studios, they, are, now, also, used, for, music, videos, direct, to, video, movies, corporate, and, educational, videos, marriage, videos, etc, these, cameras, earlier, used, vacuum, tubes, and, later, electronic, image, sensors, a, camcorder, is, an, electronic, device, combining, a, video, camera, and, a, video, recorder, although, marketing, materials, may, use, the, colloquial, term, camcorder, the, name, on, the, package, and, manual, is, often, video, camera, recorder, most, devices, capable, of, recording, video, are, camera, phones, and, digital, cameras, primarily, intended, for, still, pictures, the, term, camcorder, is, used, to, describe, a, portable, self, contained, device, with, video, capture, and, recording, its, primary, function, a, digital, camera, or, digicam, is, a, camera, that, encodes, digital, images, and, videos, and, stores, them, for, later, reproduction, they, typically, use, semiconductor, image, sensors, most, cameras, sold, today, are, digital, and, they, are, incorporated, into, many, devices, ranging, from, mobile, phones, called, camera, phones, to, vehicles, digital, and, film, cameras, share, an, optical, system, typically, using, a, lens, of, variable, aperture, to, focus, light, onto, an, image, pickup, device, the, aperture, and, shutter, admit, the, correct, amount, of, light, to, the, imager, just, as, with, film, but, the, image, pickup, device, is, electronic, rather, than, chemical, however, unlike, film, cameras, digital, cameras, can, display, images, on, a, screen, immediately, after, being, captured, or, recorded, and, store, and, delete, images, from, memory, most, digital, cameras, can, also, record, moving, videos, with, sound, some, digital, cameras, can, crop, and, stitch, pictures, perform, other, elementary, image, editing, consumers, adopted, digital, cameras, in, the, 1990s, professional, video, cameras, transitioned, to, digital, around, the, 2000s, 2010s, finally, movie, cameras, transitioned, to, digital, in, the, 2010s, the, first, camera, using, digital, electronics, to, capture, and, store, images, was, developed, by, kodak, engineer, steven, sasson, in, 1975, he, used, a, charge, coupled, device, ccd, provided, by, fairchild, semiconductor, which, provided, only, 0, 01, megapixels, to, capture, images, sasson, combined, the, ccd, device, with, movie, camera, parts, to, create, a, digital, camera, that, saved, black, and, white, images, onto, a, cassette, tape, 442, the, images, were, then, read, from, the, cassette, and, viewed, on, a, tv, monitor, 225, later, cassette, tapes, were, replaced, by, flash, memory, in, 1986, japanese, company, nikon, introduced, an, analog, recording, electronic, single, lens, reflex, camera, the, nikon, svc, the, first, full, frame, digital, slr, cameras, were, developed, in, japan, from, around, 2000, to, 2002, the, mz, d, by, pentax, the, n, digital, by, contax, s, japanese, r6d, team, and, the, eos, 1ds, by, canon, gradually, in, the, 2000s, the, full, frame, dslr, became, the, dominant, camera, type, for, professional, photography, on, most, digital, cameras, a, display, often, a, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, permits, the, user, to, view, the, scene, to, be, recorded, and, settings, such, as, iso, speed, exposure, and, shutter, speed, 6, 7, 12, in, 2000, sharp, introduced, the, world, s, first, digital, camera, phone, the, j, sh04, j, phone, in, japan, by, the, mid, 2000s, higher, end, cell, phones, had, an, integrated, digital, camera, and, by, the, beginning, of, the, 2010s, almost, all, smartphones, had, an, integrated, digital, camera
