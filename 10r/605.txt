spaceflight, or, space, flight, is, an, application, of, astronautics, to, fly, objects, usually, spacecraft, into, or, through, outer, space, either, with, or, without, humans, on, board, most, spaceflight, is, uncrewed, and, conducted, mainly, with, spacecraft, such, as, satellites, in, orbit, around, earth, but, also, includes, space, probes, for, flights, beyond, earth, orbit, such, spaceflight, operate, either, by, telerobotic, or, autonomous, control, the, more, complex, human, spaceflight, has, been, pursued, soon, after, the, first, orbital, satellites, and, has, reached, the, moon, and, permanent, human, presence, in, space, around, earth, particularly, with, the, use, of, space, stations, human, spaceflight, programs, include, the, soyuz, shenzhou, the, past, apollo, moon, landing, and, the, space, shuttle, programs, other, current, spaceflight, are, conducted, to, the, international, space, station, and, to, china, s, tiangong, space, station, spaceflight, is, used, for, placing, in, earth, s, orbit, communications, satellites, reconnaissance, satellites, earth, observation, satellites, but, also, for, space, exploration, such, as, space, observatories, and, space, probes, or, even, for, space, tourism, spaceflight, can, be, achieved, with, different, types, of, launch, systems, conventionally, by, rocket, launching, which, provide, the, initial, thrust, to, overcome, the, force, of, gravity, and, propel, a, spacecraft, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, once, in, space, the, motion, of, a, spacecraft, both, when, unpropelled, and, when, under, propulsion, is, covered, by, the, area, of, study, called, astrodynamics, some, spacecraft, remain, in, space, practically, indefinitely, which, has, created, the, problem, of, space, pollution, in, the, form, of, light, pollution, and, space, junk, which, is, a, hazard, to, spaceflight, otherwise, spacecraft, are, terminated, by, atmospheric, reentry, in, which, they, disintegrate, or, if, they, do, not, their, reentry, is, mostly, controlled, to, safely, reach, a, surface, by, landing, or, impacting, often, being, dumped, into, the, oceanic, spacecraft, cemetery, spacecraft, have, thus, been, the, subject, of, some, space, traffic, management, there, are, several, terms, that, refer, to, a, flight, into, or, through, outer, space, a, space, mission, refers, to, a, spaceflight, intended, to, achieve, an, objective, objectives, for, space, missions, may, include, space, exploration, space, research, and, national, firsts, in, spaceflight, space, transport, is, the, use, of, spacecraft, to, transport, people, or, cargo, into, or, through, outer, space, this, may, include, human, spaceflight, and, cargo, spacecraft, flight, the, first, theoretical, proposal, of, space, travel, using, rockets, was, published, by, scottish, astronomer, and, mathematician, william, leitch, in, an, 1861, essay, a, journey, through, space, more, well, known, though, not, widely, outside, russia, is, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, s, work, the, exploration, of, cosmic, space, by, means, of, reaction, devices, published, in, 1903, spaceflight, became, an, engineering, possibility, with, the, work, of, robert, h, goddard, s, publication, in, 1919, of, his, paper, a, method, of, reaching, extreme, altitudes, his, application, of, the, de, laval, nozzle, to, liquid, fuel, rockets, improved, efficiency, enough, for, interplanetary, travel, to, become, possible, he, also, proved, in, the, laboratory, that, rockets, would, work, in, the, vacuum, of, space, nonetheless, his, work, was, not, taken, seriously, by, the, public, his, attempt, to, secure, an, army, contract, for, a, rocket, propelled, weapon, in, the, first, world, war, was, defeated, by, the, november, 11, 1918, armistice, with, germany, working, with, private, financial, support, he, was, the, first, to, launch, a, liquid, fueled, rocket, on, march, 16, 1926, goddard, s, papers, were, highly, influential, internationally, in, his, field, in, the, course, of, world, war, ii, the, first, guided, rockets, the, v, 2, were, developed, and, employed, as, weapons, by, nazi, germany, at, a, test, flight, in, june, 1944, one, such, rocket, reached, space, at, an, altitude, of, 189, kilometers, 102, nautical, miles, becoming, the, first, man, made, object, to, do, so, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, most, of, the, v, 2, rocket, team, including, its, head, wernher, von, braun, surrendered, to, the, united, states, and, were, expatriated, to, work, on, american, missiles, at, what, became, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, producing, missiles, such, as, juno, i, and, atlas, the, soviet, union, under, joseph, stalin, developed, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, to, carry, nuclear, weapons, as, a, counter, measure, to, united, states, bomber, planes, the, tsiolkovsky, influenced, sergey, korolev, became, the, chief, rocket, designer, and, derivatives, of, his, r, 7, semyorka, missiles, were, used, to, launch, the, world, s, first, artificial, earth, satellite, sputnik, 1, on, october, 4, 1957, and, later, the, first, human, to, orbit, the, earth, yuri, gagarin, in, vostok, 1, on, april, 12, 1961, the, first, us, satellite, was, explorer, 1, launched, on, february, 1, 1958, and, the, first, american, in, orbit, became, john, glenn, in, friendship, 7, on, february, 20, 1962, as, director, of, the, marshall, space, flight, center, von, braun, oversaw, development, of, a, larger, class, of, rocket, called, saturn, which, allowed, the, us, to, send, the, first, two, humans, neil, armstrong, and, buzz, aldrin, to, the, moon, and, back, on, apollo, 11, in, july, 1969, at, the, same, time, the, soviet, union, secretly, tried, but, failed, to, develop, the, n1, rocket, meant, to, give, them, the, capability, to, land, humans, on, the, moon, spaceflight, has, been, widely, employed, by, numerous, government, and, commercial, entities, for, placing, satellites, into, orbit, around, earth, for, a, broad, range, of, purposes, certain, government, agencies, have, also, sent, uncrewed, spacecraft, exploring, space, beyond, the, moon, and, developed, continuous, crewed, human, presence, in, space, with, a, series, of, space, stations, from, the, salyut, program, to, the, international, space, station, rockets, are, the, only, means, currently, capable, of, reaching, orbit, or, beyond, other, non, rocket, spacelaunch, technologies, have, yet, to, be, built, or, remain, short, of, orbital, speeds, a, rocket, launch, for, a, spaceflight, usually, starts, from, a, spaceport, cosmodrome, which, may, be, equipped, with, launch, complexes, and, launch, pads, for, vertical, rocket, launches, and, runways, for, takeoff, and, landing, of, carrier, airplanes, and, winged, spacecraft, spaceports, are, situated, well, away, from, human, habitation, for, noise, and, safety, reasons, icbms, have, various, special, launching, facilities, a, launch, is, often, restricted, to, certain, launch, windows, these, windows, depend, upon, the, position, of, celestial, bodies, and, orbits, relative, to, the, launch, site, the, biggest, influence, is, often, the, rotation, of, the, earth, itself, once, launched, orbits, are, normally, located, within, relatively, constant, flat, planes, at, a, fixed, angle, to, the, axis, of, the, earth, and, the, earth, rotates, within, this, orbit, a, launch, pad, is, a, fixed, structure, designed, to, dispatch, airborne, vehicles, it, generally, consists, of, a, launch, tower, and, flame, trench, it, is, surrounded, by, equipment, used, to, erect, fuel, and, maintain, launch, vehicles, before, launch, the, rocket, can, weigh, hundreds, of, tons, the, space, shuttle, columbia, on, sts, 1, weighed, 2030, metric, tons, 4, 480, 000, lb, at, takeoff, the, most, commonly, used, definition, of, outer, space, is, everything, beyond, the, k, rm, n, line, which, is, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, above, the, earth, s, surface, the, united, states, sometimes, defines, outer, space, as, everything, beyond, 50, miles, 80, km, in, altitude, rocket, engines, are, the, only, currently, practical, means, of, reaching, space, conventional, airplane, engines, cannot, reach, space, due, to, the, lack, of, oxygen, rocket, engines, expel, propellant, to, provide, forward, thrust, that, generates, enough, delta, v, change, in, velocity, to, reach, orbit, for, crewed, launch, systems, launch, escape, systems, are, frequently, fitted, to, allow, astronauts, to, escape, in, the, case, of, emergency, many, ways, to, reach, space, other, than, rocket, engines, have, been, proposed, ideas, such, as, the, space, elevator, and, momentum, exchange, tethers, like, rotovators, or, skyhooks, require, new, materials, much, stronger, than, any, currently, known, electromagnetic, launchers, such, as, launch, loops, might, be, feasible, with, current, technology, other, ideas, include, rocket, assisted, aircraft, spaceplanes, such, as, reaction, engines, skylon, currently, in, early, stage, development, scramjet, powered, spaceplanes, and, rbcc, powered, spaceplanes, gun, launch, has, been, proposed, for, cargo, on, some, missions, beyond, leo, low, earth, orbit, spacecraft, are, inserted, into, parking, orbits, or, lower, intermediary, orbits, the, parking, orbit, approach, greatly, simplified, apollo, mission, planning, in, several, important, ways, it, acted, as, a, time, buffer, and, substantially, widened, the, allowable, launch, windows, the, parking, orbit, gave, the, crew, and, controllers, several, hours, to, thoroughly, check, out, the, spacecraft, after, the, stresses, of, launch, before, committing, it, for, a, long, journey, to, the, moon, robotic, missions, do, not, require, an, abort, capability, or, radiation, minimization, and, because, modern, launchers, routinely, meet, instantaneous, launch, windows, space, probes, to, the, moon, and, other, planets, generally, use, direct, injection, to, maximize, performance, although, some, might, coast, briefly, during, the, launch, sequence, they, do, not, complete, one, or, more, full, parking, orbits, before, the, burn, that, injects, them, onto, an, earth, escape, trajectory, the, escape, velocity, from, a, celestial, body, decreases, with, altitude, above, that, body, however, it, is, more, fuel, efficient, for, a, craft, to, burn, its, fuel, as, close, as, possible, to, its, periapsis, lowest, point, see, oberth, effect, astrodynamics, is, the, study, of, spacecraft, trajectories, particularly, as, they, relate, to, gravitational, and, propulsion, effects, astrodynamics, allows, for, a, spacecraft, to, arrive, at, its, destination, at, the, correct, time, without, excessive, propellant, use, an, orbital, maneuvering, system, may, be, needed, to, maintain, or, change, orbits, non, rocket, orbital, propulsion, methods, include, solar, sails, magnetic, sails, plasma, bubble, magnetic, systems, and, using, gravitational, slingshot, effects, the, term, transfer, energy, means, the, total, amount, of, energy, imparted, by, a, rocket, stage, to, its, payload, this, can, be, the, energy, imparted, by, a, first, stage, of, a, launch, vehicle, to, an, upper, stage, plus, payload, or, by, an, upper, stage, or, spacecraft, kick, motor, to, a, spacecraft, in, order, to, reach, towards, a, space, station, a, spacecraft, would, have, to, arrive, at, the, same, orbit, and, approach, to, a, very, close, distance, e, g, within, visual, contact, this, is, done, by, a, set, of, orbital, maneuvers, called, space, rendezvous, after, rendezvousing, with, the, space, station, the, space, vehicle, then, docks, or, berths, with, the, station, docking, refers, to, joining, of, two, separate, free, flying, space, vehicles, while, berthing, refers, to, mating, operations, where, an, inactive, vehicle, is, placed, into, the, mating, interface, of, another, space, vehicle, by, using, a, robotic, arm, vehicles, in, orbit, have, large, amounts, of, kinetic, energy, this, energy, must, be, discarded, if, the, vehicle, is, to, land, safely, without, vaporizing, in, the, atmosphere, typically, this, process, requires, special, methods, to, protect, against, aerodynamic, heating, the, theory, behind, reentry, was, developed, by, harry, julian, allen, based, on, this, theory, reentry, vehicles, present, blunt, shapes, to, the, atmosphere, for, reentry, blunt, shapes, mean, that, less, than, 1, of, the, kinetic, energy, ends, up, as, heat, reaching, the, vehicle, and, the, remainder, heats, up, the, atmosphere, the, mercury, gemini, and, apollo, capsules, all, splashed, down, in, the, sea, these, capsules, were, designed, to, land, at, relatively, low, speeds, with, the, help, of, a, parachute, soviet, russian, capsules, for, soyuz, make, use, of, a, big, parachute, and, braking, rockets, to, touch, down, on, land, spaceplanes, like, the, space, shuttle, land, like, a, glider, after, a, successful, landing, the, spacecraft, its, occupants, and, cargo, can, be, recovered, in, some, cases, recovery, has, occurred, before, landing, while, a, spacecraft, is, still, descending, on, its, parachute, it, can, be, snagged, by, a, specially, designed, aircraft, this, mid, air, retrieval, technique, was, used, to, recover, the, film, canisters, from, the, corona, spy, satellites, uncrewed, spacecraft, or, robotic, spacecraft, are, spacecraft, without, people, on, board, uncrewed, spacecraft, may, have, varying, levels, of, autonomy, from, human, input, such, as, remote, control, or, remote, guidance, they, may, also, be, autonomous, in, which, they, have, a, pre, programmed, list, of, operations, that, will, be, executed, unless, otherwise, instructed, a, robotic, spacecraft, for, scientific, measurements, is, often, called, a, space, probe, or, space, observatory, many, space, missions, are, more, suited, to, telerobotic, rather, than, crewed, operation, due, to, lower, cost, and, risk, factors, in, addition, some, planetary, destinations, such, as, venus, or, the, vicinity, of, jupiter, are, too, hostile, for, human, survival, given, current, technology, outer, planets, such, as, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, are, too, distant, to, reach, with, current, crewed, spaceflight, technology, so, telerobotic, probes, are, the, only, way, to, explore, them, telerobotics, also, allows, exploration, of, regions, that, are, vulnerable, to, contamination, by, earth, micro, organisms, since, spacecraft, can, be, sterilized, humans, can, not, be, sterilized, in, the, same, way, as, a, spaceship, as, they, coexist, with, numerous, micro, organisms, and, these, micro, organisms, are, also, hard, to, contain, within, a, spaceship, or, spacesuit, the, first, uncrewed, space, mission, was, sputnik, launched, october, 4, 1957, to, orbit, the, earth, nearly, all, satellites, landers, and, rovers, are, robotic, spacecraft, not, every, uncrewed, spacecraft, is, a, robotic, spacecraft, for, example, a, reflector, ball, is, a, non, robotic, uncrewed, spacecraft, space, missions, where, other, animals, but, no, humans, are, on, board, are, called, uncrewed, missions, the, first, human, spaceflight, was, vostok, 1, on, april, 12, 1961, on, which, cosmonaut, yuri, gagarin, of, the, ussr, made, one, orbit, around, the, earth, in, official, soviet, documents, there, is, no, mention, of, the, fact, that, gagarin, parachuted, the, final, seven, miles, as, of, 2020, the, only, spacecraft, regularly, used, for, human, spaceflight, are, soyuz, shenzhou, and, crew, dragon, the, u, s, space, shuttle, fleet, operated, from, april, 1981, until, july, 2011, spaceshipone, has, conducted, two, human, suborbital, spaceflights, on, a, sub, orbital, spaceflight, the, spacecraft, reaches, space, and, then, returns, to, the, atmosphere, after, following, a, primarily, ballistic, trajectory, this, is, usually, because, of, insufficient, specific, orbital, energy, in, which, case, a, suborbital, flight, will, last, only, a, few, minutes, but, it, is, also, possible, for, an, object, with, enough, energy, for, an, orbit, to, have, a, trajectory, that, intersects, the, earth, s, atmosphere, sometimes, after, many, hours, pioneer, 1, was, nasa, s, first, space, probe, intended, to, reach, the, moon, a, partial, failure, caused, it, to, instead, follow, a, suborbital, trajectory, to, an, altitude, of, 113, 854, kilometers, 70, 746, mi, before, reentering, the, earth, s, atmosphere, 43, hours, after, launch, the, most, generally, recognized, boundary, of, space, is, the, k, rm, n, line, 100, km, 62, mi, above, sea, level, nasa, alternatively, defines, an, astronaut, as, someone, who, has, flown, more, than, 80, km, 50, mi, above, sea, level, it, is, not, generally, recognized, by, the, public, that, the, increase, in, potential, energy, required, to, pass, the, k, rm, n, line, is, only, about, 3, of, the, orbital, energy, potential, plus, kinetic, energy, required, by, the, lowest, possible, earth, orbit, a, circular, orbit, just, above, the, k, rm, n, line, in, other, words, it, is, far, easier, to, reach, space, than, to, stay, there, on, may, 17, 2004, civilian, space, exploration, team, launched, the, gofast, rocket, on, a, suborbital, flight, the, first, amateur, spaceflight, on, june, 21, 2004, spaceshipone, was, used, for, the, first, privately, funded, human, spaceflight, point, to, point, or, earth, to, earth, transportation, is, a, category, of, sub, orbital, spaceflight, in, which, a, spacecraft, provides, rapid, transport, between, two, terrestrial, locations, a, conventional, airline, route, between, london, and, sydney, a, flight, that, normally, lasts, over, twenty, hours, could, be, traversed, in, less, than, one, hour, while, no, company, offers, this, type, of, transportation, today, spacex, has, revealed, plans, to, do, so, as, early, as, the, 2020s, using, starship, suborbital, spaceflight, over, an, intercontinental, distance, requires, a, vehicle, velocity, that, is, only, a, little, lower, than, the, velocity, required, to, reach, low, earth, orbit, if, rockets, are, used, the, size, of, the, rocket, relative, to, the, payload, is, similar, to, an, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, icbm, any, intercontinental, spaceflight, has, to, surmount, problems, of, heating, during, atmosphere, re, entry, that, are, nearly, as, large, as, those, faced, by, orbital, spaceflight, a, minimal, orbital, spaceflight, requires, much, higher, velocities, than, a, minimal, sub, orbital, flight, and, so, it, is, technologically, much, more, challenging, to, achieve, to, achieve, orbital, spaceflight, the, tangential, velocity, around, the, earth, is, as, important, as, altitude, in, order, to, perform, a, stable, and, lasting, flight, in, space, the, spacecraft, must, reach, the, minimal, orbital, speed, required, for, a, closed, orbit, interplanetary, spaceflight, is, flight, between, planets, within, a, single, planetary, system, in, practice, the, use, of, the, term, is, confined, to, travel, between, the, planets, of, our, solar, system, plans, for, future, crewed, interplanetary, spaceflight, missions, often, include, final, vehicle, assembly, in, earth, orbit, such, as, nasa, s, constellation, program, and, russia, s, kliper, parom, tandem, new, horizons, is, the, fifth, spacecraft, put, on, an, escape, trajectory, leaving, the, solar, system, voyager, 1, voyager, 2, pioneer, 10, pioneer, 11, are, the, earlier, ones, the, one, farthest, from, the, sun, is, voyager, 1, which, is, more, than, 100, au, distant, and, is, moving, at, 3, 6, au, per, year, in, comparison, proxima, centauri, the, closest, star, other, than, the, sun, is, 267, 000, au, distant, it, will, take, voyager, 1, over, 74, 000, years, to, reach, this, distance, vehicle, designs, using, other, techniques, such, as, nuclear, pulse, propulsion, are, likely, to, be, able, to, reach, the, nearest, star, significantly, faster, another, possibility, that, could, allow, for, human, interstellar, spaceflight, is, to, make, use, of, time, dilation, as, this, would, make, it, possible, for, passengers, in, a, fast, moving, vehicle, to, travel, further, into, the, future, while, aging, very, little, in, that, their, great, speed, slows, down, the, rate, of, passage, of, on, board, time, however, attaining, such, high, speeds, would, still, require, the, use, of, some, new, advanced, method, of, propulsion, dynamic, soaring, as, a, way, to, travel, across, interstellar, space, has, been, proposed, as, well, intergalactic, travel, involves, spaceflight, between, galaxies, and, is, considered, much, more, technologically, demanding, than, even, interstellar, travel, and, by, current, engineering, terms, is, considered, science, fiction, however, theoretically, speaking, there, is, nothing, to, conclusively, indicate, that, intergalactic, travel, is, impossible, to, date, several, academics, have, studied, intergalactic, travel, in, a, serious, manner, spacecraft, are, vehicles, designed, to, operate, in, space, the, first, true, spacecraft, is, sometimes, said, to, be, apollo, lunar, module, since, this, was, the, only, crewed, vehicle, to, have, been, designed, for, and, operated, only, in, space, and, is, notable, for, its, non, aerodynamic, shape, spacecraft, today, predominantly, use, rockets, for, propulsion, but, other, propulsion, techniques, such, as, ion, drives, are, becoming, more, common, particularly, for, uncrewed, vehicles, and, this, can, significantly, reduce, the, vehicle, s, mass, and, increase, its, delta, v, launch, systems, are, used, to, carry, a, payload, from, earth, s, surface, into, outer, space, most, current, spaceflight, uses, multi, stage, expendable, launch, systems, to, reach, space, the, first, reusable, spacecraft, the, x, 15, was, air, launched, on, a, suborbital, trajectory, on, 19, july, 1963, the, first, partially, reusable, orbital, spacecraft, the, space, shuttle, was, launched, by, the, usa, on, the, 20th, anniversary, of, yuri, gagarin, s, flight, on, 12, april, 1981, during, the, shuttle, era, six, orbiters, were, built, all, of, which, flown, in, the, atmosphere, and, five, of, which, flown, in, space, the, enterprise, was, used, only, for, approach, and, landing, tests, launching, from, the, back, of, a, boeing, 747, and, gliding, to, deadstick, landings, at, edwards, afb, california, the, first, space, shuttle, to, fly, into, space, was, the, columbia, followed, by, the, challenger, discovery, atlantis, and, endeavour, the, endeavour, was, built, to, replace, the, challenger, which, was, lost, in, january, 1986, the, columbia, broke, up, during, reentry, in, february, 2003, the, first, automatic, partially, reusable, spacecraft, was, the, buran, snowstorm, launched, by, the, ussr, on, 15, november, 1988, although, it, made, only, one, flight, this, spaceplane, was, designed, for, a, crew, and, strongly, resembled, the, us, space, shuttle, although, its, drop, off, boosters, used, liquid, propellants, and, its, main, engines, were, located, at, the, base, of, what, would, be, the, external, tank, in, the, american, shuttle, lack, of, funding, complicated, by, the, dissolution, of, the, ussr, prevented, any, further, flights, of, buran, the, space, shuttle, was, retired, in, 2011, due, mainly, to, its, old, age, the, shuttle, s, human, transport, role, is, to, be, replaced, by, the, spacex, dragon, 2, and, cst, 100, in, the, 2020s, the, shuttle, s, heavy, cargo, transport, role, is, now, done, by, commercial, launch, vehicles, scaled, composites, spaceshipone, was, a, reusable, suborbital, spaceplane, that, carried, pilots, mike, melvill, and, brian, binnie, on, consecutive, flights, in, 2004, to, win, the, ansari, x, prize, the, spaceship, company, has, built, its, successor, spaceshiptwo, a, fleet, of, spaceshiptwos, operated, by, virgin, galactic, planned, to, begin, reusable, private, spaceflight, carrying, paying, passengers, space, tourists, in, 2008, but, this, was, delayed, due, to, an, accident, in, the, propulsion, development, spacex, achieved, the, first, vertical, soft, landing, of, a, re, usable, orbital, rocket, stage, on, december, 21, 2015, after, delivering, 11, orbcomm, og, 2, commercial, satellites, into, low, earth, orbit, the, first, falcon, 9, second, flight, occurred, on, 30, march, 2017, spacex, now, routinely, recovers, and, reuses, their, first, stages, with, the, intent, of, reusing, fairings, as, well, spacex, is, now, developing, a, fully, reusable, super, heavy, lift, rocket, known, as, starship, hoped, to, drastically, reduce, the, price, of, space, exploration, due, to, being, fully, reusable, all, launch, vehicles, contain, a, huge, amount, of, energy, that, is, needed, for, some, part, of, it, to, reach, orbit, there, is, therefore, some, risk, that, this, energy, can, be, released, prematurely, and, suddenly, with, significant, effects, when, a, delta, ii, rocket, exploded, 13, seconds, after, launch, on, january, 17, 1997, there, were, reports, of, store, windows, 10, miles, 16, km, away, being, broken, by, the, blast, space, is, a, fairly, predictable, environment, but, there, are, still, risks, of, accidental, depressurization, and, the, potential, failure, of, equipment, some, of, which, may, be, very, newly, developed, in, april, 2004, the, international, association, for, the, advancement, of, space, safety, was, established, in, the, netherlands, to, further, international, cooperation, and, scientific, advancement, in, space, systems, safety, in, a, microgravity, environment, such, as, that, provided, by, a, spacecraft, in, orbit, around, the, earth, humans, experience, a, sense, of, weightlessness, short, term, exposure, to, microgravity, causes, space, adaptation, syndrome, a, self, limiting, nausea, caused, by, derangement, of, the, vestibular, system, long, term, exposure, causes, multiple, health, issues, the, most, significant, is, bone, loss, some, of, which, is, permanent, but, microgravity, also, leads, to, significant, deconditioning, of, muscular, and, cardiovascular, tissues, once, above, the, atmosphere, radiation, due, to, the, van, allen, belts, solar, radiation, and, cosmic, radiation, issues, occur, and, increase, further, away, from, the, earth, solar, flares, can, give, a, fatal, radiation, dose, in, minutes, and, the, health, threat, from, cosmic, radiation, significantly, increases, the, chances, of, cancer, over, a, decade, exposure, or, more, in, human, spaceflight, the, life, support, system, is, a, group, of, devices, that, allow, a, human, being, to, survive, in, outer, space, nasa, often, uses, the, phrase, environmental, control, and, life, support, system, or, the, acronym, eclss, when, describing, these, systems, for, its, human, spaceflight, missions, the, life, support, system, may, supply, air, water, and, food, it, must, also, maintain, the, correct, body, temperature, an, acceptable, pressure, on, the, body, and, deal, with, the, body, s, waste, products, shielding, against, harmful, external, influences, such, as, radiation, and, micro, meteorites, may, also, be, necessary, components, of, the, life, support, system, are, life, critical, and, are, designed, and, constructed, using, safety, engineering, techniques, space, weather, is, the, concept, of, changing, environmental, conditions, in, outer, space, it, is, distinct, from, the, concept, of, weather, within, a, planetary, atmosphere, and, deals, with, phenomena, involving, ambient, plasma, magnetic, fields, radiation, and, other, matter, in, space, generally, close, to, earth, but, also, in, interplanetary, and, occasionally, interstellar, medium, space, weather, describes, the, conditions, in, space, that, affect, earth, and, its, technological, systems, our, space, weather, is, a, consequence, of, the, behavior, of, the, sun, the, nature, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, our, location, in, the, solar, system, space, weather, exerts, a, profound, influence, in, several, areas, related, to, space, exploration, and, development, changing, geomagnetic, conditions, can, induce, changes, in, atmospheric, density, causing, the, rapid, degradation, of, spacecraft, altitude, in, low, earth, orbit, geomagnetic, storms, due, to, increased, solar, activity, can, potentially, blind, sensors, onboard, spacecraft, or, interfere, with, on, board, electronics, an, understanding, of, space, environmental, conditions, is, also, important, in, designing, shielding, and, life, support, systems, for, crewed, spacecraft, exhaust, pollution, of, rockets, depends, on, the, produced, exhausts, by, the, propellants, reactions, and, the, location, of, exhaustion, they, mostly, exhaust, greenhouse, gases, and, sometimes, toxic, components, particularly, at, higher, levels, of, the, atmosphere, the, potency, of, exhausted, gases, as, greenhouse, gases, increases, considerably, many, solid, rockets, have, chlorine, in, the, form, of, perchlorate, or, other, chemicals, and, this, can, cause, temporary, local, holes, in, the, ozone, layer, re, entering, spacecraft, generate, nitrates, which, also, can, temporarily, impact, the, ozone, layer, most, rockets, are, made, of, metals, that, can, have, an, environmental, impact, during, their, construction, while, spaceflight, altogether, pollutes, at, a, fraction, of, other, human, activities, it, still, does, pollute, heavily, if, calculated, per, passenger, in, addition, to, the, atmospheric, effects, there, are, effects, on, the, near, earth, space, environment, there, is, the, possibility, that, orbit, could, become, inaccessible, for, generations, due, to, exponentially, increasing, space, debris, caused, by, spalling, of, satellites, and, vehicles, kessler, syndrome, many, launched, vehicles, today, are, therefore, designed, to, be, re, entered, after, use, a, wide, range, of, issues, such, as, space, traffic, management, or, liability, have, been, issues, of, spaceflight, regulation, participation, and, representation, of, all, humanity, in, spaceflight, is, an, issue, of, international, space, law, ever, since, the, first, phase, of, space, exploration, even, though, some, rights, of, non, spacefaring, countries, have, been, secured, sharing, of, space, for, all, humanity, is, still, criticized, as, imperialist, and, lacking, understanding, spaceflight, as, a, resource, access, to, outer, space, has, been, enabled, and, limited, through, and, for, some, few, countries, as, non, spacefaring, countries, particularly, of, the, global, south, have, pointed, out, therefore, inclusion, has, been, a, national, and, international, issue, resulting, in, 1967, in, the, outer, space, treaty, and, its, claim, of, outer, space, as, the, province, of, all, mankind, furthermore, social, inclusion, in, human, spaceflight, has, been, demanded, with, women, to, fly, to, space, being, still, limited, and, minorities, like, people, with, disability, only, having, been, selected, in, european, space, agency, s, 2022, astronaut, group, the, dominating, issue, about, access, in, most, recent, years, has, been, the, issue, of, space, debris, and, space, sustainability, since, established, spacefaring, countries, endanger, access, to, outer, space, with, their, orbital, space, polluting, activity, current, and, proposed, applications, for, spaceflight, include, most, early, spaceflight, development, was, paid, for, by, governments, however, today, major, launch, markets, such, as, communication, satellites, and, satellite, television, are, purely, commercial, though, many, of, the, launchers, were, originally, funded, by, governments, private, spaceflight, is, a, rapidly, developing, area, space, flight, that, is, not, only, paid, for, by, corporations, or, even, private, individuals, but, often, provided, by, private, spaceflight, companies, these, companies, often, assert, that, much, of, the, previous, high, cost, of, access, to, space, was, caused, by, governmental, inefficiencies, they, can, avoid, this, assertion, can, be, supported, by, much, lower, published, launch, costs, for, private, space, launch, vehicles, such, as, falcon, 9, developed, with, private, financing, lower, launch, costs, and, excellent, safety, will, be, required, for, the, applications, such, as, space, tourism, and, especially, space, colonization, to, become, feasible, for, expansion, to, be, spacefaring, is, to, be, capable, of, and, active, in, the, operation, of, spacecraft, it, involves, a, knowledge, of, a, variety, of, topics, and, development, of, specialised, skills, including, aeronautics, astronautics, programs, to, train, astronauts, space, weather, and, forecasting, spacecraft, operations, operation, of, various, equipment, spacecraft, design, and, construction, atmospheric, takeoff, and, reentry,

equipment, dangerous, cargos, and, cargo, storage, spacewalking, dealing, with, emergencies, survival, at, space, and, first, aid, fire, fighting, life, support, the, degree, of, knowledge, needed, within, these, areas, is, dependent, upon, the, nature, of, the, work, and, the, type, of, vessel, employed, spacefaring, is, analogous, to, seafaring, there, has, never, been, a, crewed, mission, outside, the, earth, moon, system, however, the, united, states, russia, china, european, space, agency, esa, countries, and, a, few, corporations, and, enterprises, have, plans, in, various, stages, to, travel, to, mars, see, human, mission, to, mars, spacefaring, entities, can, be, sovereign, states, supranational, entities, and, private, corporations, spacefaring, nations, are, those, capable, of, independently, building, and, launching, craft, into, space, a, growing, number, of, private, entities, have, become, or, are, becoming, spacefaring, the, united, nations, office, for, outer, space, affairs, unoosa, has, been, the, main, multilateral, body, servicing, international, contact, and, exchange, on, space, activity, among, spacefaring, and, non, spacefaring, states, currently, russia, the, united, states, and, china, are, the, only, crewed, spacefaring, nations, spacefaring, nations, listed, by, date, of, first, crewed, launch, the, following, nations, or, organizations, have, developed, their, own, launch, vehicles, to, launch, uncrewed, spacecraft, into, orbit, either, from, their, own, territory, or, with, foreign, assistance, date, of, first, launch, in, parentheses, also, several, countries, such, as, canada, italy, and, australia, had, semi, independent, spacefaring, capability, launching, locally, built, satellites, on, foreign, launchers, canada, had, designed, and, built, satellites, alouette, 1, and, 2, in, 1962, and, 1965, which, were, orbited, using, u, s, launch, vehicles, italy, has, designed, and, built, several, satellites, as, well, as, pressurized, modules, for, the, international, space, station, early, italian, satellites, were, launched, using, vehicles, provided, by, nasa, first, from, wallops, flight, facility, in, 1964, and, then, from, a, spaceport, in, kenya, san, marco, platform, between, 1967, and, 1988, italy, has, led, the, development, of, the, vega, rocket, programme, within, the, european, space, agency, since, 1998, the, united, kingdom, abandoned, its, independent, space, launch, program, in, 1972, in, favour, of, co, operating, with, the, european, launcher, development, organisation, eldo, on, launch, technologies, until, 1974, australia, abandoned, its, launcher, program, shortly, after, the, successful, launch, of, wresat, and, became, the, only, non, european, member, of, eldo,
