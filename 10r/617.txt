the, voyager, program, is, an, american, scientific, program, that, employs, two, interstellar, probes, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, they, were, launched, in, 1977, to, take, advantage, of, a, favorable, alignment, of, the, two, gas, giants, jupiter, and, saturn, and, the, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, to, fly, near, them, while, collecting, data, for, transmission, back, to, earth, after, launch, the, decision, was, made, to, send, voyager, 2, near, uranus, and, neptune, to, collect, data, for, transmission, back, to, earth, on, 25, august, 2012, data, from, voyager, 1, indicated, that, it, had, entered, interstellar, space, on, 5, november, 2019, data, from, voyager, 2, indicated, that, it, also, had, entered, interstellar, space, on, 4, november, 2019, scientists, reported, that, on, 5, november, 2018, the, voyager, 2, probe, had, officially, reached, the, interstellar, medium, ism, a, region, of, outer, space, beyond, the, influence, of, the, solar, wind, as, did, voyager, 1, in, 2012, in, august, 2018, nasa, confirmed, based, on, results, by, the, new, horizons, spacecraft, the, existence, of, a, hydrogen, wall, at, the, outer, edges, of, the, solar, system, that, was, first, detected, in, 1992, by, the, two, voyager, spacecraft, as, of, 2024, the, voyagers, are, still, in, operation, beyond, the, outer, boundary, of, the, heliosphere, in, interstellar, space, voyager, 1, is, moving, with, a, velocity, of, 61, 198, kilometers, per, hour, 38, 027, mph, or, 17, km, s, relative, to, the, sun, and, is, 24, 475, 900, 000, kilometers, 1, 52086, 10, 10, mi, from, the, sun, reaching, a, distance, of, 162, au, 24, 2, billion, km, 15, 1, billion, mi, from, earth, as, of, may, 25, 2024, as, of, 2024, voyager, 2, is, moving, with, a, velocity, of, 55, 347, kilometers, per, hour, 34, 391, mph, or, 15, km, s, relative, to, the, sun, and, is, 20, 439, 100, 000, kilometers, 1, 27003, 10, 10, mi, from, the, sun, reaching, a, distance, of, 136, 627, au, 20, 4, billion, km, 12, 7, billion, mi, from, earth, as, of, may, 25, 2024, voyager, did, things, no, one, predicted, found, scenes, no, one, expected, and, promises, to, outlive, its, inventors, like, a, great, painting, or, an, abiding, institution, it, has, acquired, an, existence, of, its, own, a, destiny, beyond, the, grasp, of, its, handlers, the, two, voyager, space, probes, were, originally, conceived, as, part, of, the, planetary, grand, tour, planned, during, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 70s, that, aimed, to, explore, jupiter, saturn, saturn, s, moon, titan, uranus, neptune, and, pluto, the, mission, originated, from, the, grand, tour, program, conceptualized, by, gary, flandro, an, aerospace, engineer, at, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, in, 1964, which, leveraged, a, rare, planetary, alignment, occurring, once, every, 175, years, this, alignment, allowed, a, craft, to, reach, all, outer, planets, using, gravitational, assists, the, mission, was, to, send, several, pairs, of, probes, and, gained, momentum, in, 1966, when, it, was, endorsed, by, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, however, in, december, 1971, the, grand, tour, mission, was, canceled, when, funding, was, redirected, to, the, space, shuttle, program, in, 1972, a, scaled, down, four, planets, two, identical, spacecraft, mission, was, proposed, utilizing, a, spacecraft, derived, from, the, mariner, series, initially, intended, to, be, mariner, 11, and, mariner, 12, the, gravity, assist, technique, successfully, demonstrated, by, mariner, 10, would, be, used, to, achieve, significant, velocity, changes, by, maneuvering, through, an, intermediate, planet, s, gravitational, field, to, minimize, time, towards, saturn, the, spacecrafts, were, then, moved, into, a, separate, program, named, mariner, jupiter, saturn, also, mariner, jupiter, saturn, uranus, mjs, or, mjsu, part, of, the, mariner, program, later, renamed, because, it, was, thought, that, the, design, of, the, two, space, probes, had, progressed, sufficiently, beyond, that, of, the, mariner, family, to, merit, a, separate, name, on, march, 4, 1977, nasa, announced, a, competition, to, rename, the, mission, believing, the, existing, name, was, not, appropriate, as, the, mission, had, differed, significantly, from, previous, mariner, missions, voyager, was, chosen, as, the, new, name, referencing, an, earlier, suggestion, by, william, pickering, who, had, proposed, the, name, navigator, due, to, the, name, change, occurring, close, to, launch, the, probes, were, still, occasionally, referred, to, as, mariner, 11, and, mariner, 12, or, voyager, 11, and, voyager, 12, two, mission, trajectories, were, established, jst, aimed, at, jupiter, saturn, and, enhancing, a, titan, flyby, while, jsx, served, as, a, contingency, plan, jst, focused, on, a, titan, flyby, while, jsx, provided, a, flexible, mission, plan, if, jst, succeeded, jsx, could, proceed, with, the, grand, tour, but, in, case, of, failure, jsx, could, be, redirected, for, a, separate, titan, flyby, forfeiting, the, grand, tour, opportunity, the, second, probe, now, voyager, 2, followed, the, jsx, trajectory, granting, it, the, option, to, continue, on, to, uranus, and, neptune, upon, voyager, 1, completing, its, main, objectives, at, saturn, voyager, 2, received, a, mission, extension, enabling, it, to, proceed, to, uranus, and, neptune, this, allowed, voyager, 2, to, diverge, from, the, originally, planned, jst, trajectory, the, probes, would, be, launched, in, august, or, september, 1977, with, their, main, objective, being, to, compare, the, characteristics, of, jupiter, and, saturn, such, as, their, atmospheres, magnetic, fields, particle, environments, ring, systems, and, moons, they, would, fly, by, planets, and, moons, in, either, a, jst, or, jsx, trajectory, after, completing, their, flybys, the, probes, would, communicate, with, earth, relaying, vital, data, using, their, magnetometers, spectrometers, and, other, instruments, to, detect, interstellar, solar, and, cosmic, radiation, their, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, rtgs, would, limit, the, maximum, communication, time, with, the, probes, to, roughly, a, decade, following, their, primary, missions, the, probes, would, continue, to, drift, into, interstellar, space, voyager, 2, was, the, first, to, be, launched, its, trajectory, was, designed, to, allow, flybys, of, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, voyager, 1, was, launched, after, voyager, 2, but, along, a, shorter, and, faster, trajectory, that, was, designed, to, provide, an, optimal, flyby, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, which, was, known, to, be, quite, large, and, to, possess, a, dense, atmosphere, this, encounter, sent, voyager, 1, out, of, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, ending, its, planetary, science, mission, had, voyager, 1, been, unable, to, perform, the, titan, flyby, the, trajectory, of, voyager, 2, could, have, been, altered, to, explore, titan, forgoing, any, visit, to, uranus, and, neptune, voyager, 1, was, not, launched, on, a, trajectory, that, would, have, allowed, it, to, continue, to, uranus, and, neptune, but, could, have, continued, from, saturn, to, pluto, without, exploring, titan, during, the, 1990s, voyager, 1, overtook, the, slower, deep, space, probes, pioneer, 10, and, pioneer, 11, to, become, the, most, distant, human, made, object, from, earth, a, record, that, it, will, keep, for, the, foreseeable, future, the, new, horizons, probe, which, had, a, higher, launch, velocity, than, voyager, 1, is, travelling, more, slowly, due, to, the, extra, speed, voyager, 1, gained, from, its, flybys, of, jupiter, and, saturn, voyager, 1, and, pioneer, 10, are, the, most, widely, separated, human, made, objects, anywhere, since, they, are, travelling, in, roughly, opposite, directions, from, the, solar, system, in, december, 2004, voyager, 1, crossed, the, termination, shock, where, the, solar, wind, is, slowed, to, subsonic, speed, and, entered, the, heliosheath, where, the, solar, wind, is, compressed, and, made, turbulent, due, to, interactions, with, the, interstellar, medium, on, 10, december, 2007, voyager, 2, also, reached, the, termination, shock, about, 1, 6, billion, kilometres, 1, billion, miles, closer, to, the, sun, than, from, where, voyager, 1, first, crossed, it, indicating, that, the, solar, system, is, asymmetrical, in, 2010, voyager, 1, reported, that, the, outward, velocity, of, the, solar, wind, had, dropped, to, zero, and, scientists, predicted, it, was, nearing, interstellar, space, in, 2011, data, from, the, voyagers, determined, that, the, heliosheath, is, not, smooth, but, filled, with, giant, magnetic, bubbles, theorized, to, form, when, the, magnetic, field, of, the, sun, becomes, warped, at, the, edge, of, the, solar, system, in, june, 2012, scientists, at, nasa, reported, that, voyager, 1, was, very, close, to, entering, interstellar, space, indicated, by, a, sharp, rise, in, high, energy, particles, from, outside, the, solar, system, in, september, 2013, nasa, announced, that, voyager, 1, had, crossed, the, heliopause, on, 25, august, 2012, making, it, the, first, spacecraft, to, enter, interstellar, space, in, december, 2018, nasa, announced, that, voyager, 2, had, crossed, the, heliopause, on, 5, november, 2018, making, it, the, second, spacecraft, to, enter, interstellar, space, as, of, 2017, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, continue, to, monitor, conditions, in, the, outer, expanses, of, the, solar, system, the, voyager, spacecraft, are, expected, to, be, able, to, operate, science, instruments, through, 2020, when, limited, power, will, require, instruments, to, be, deactivated, one, by, one, sometime, around, 2025, there, will, no, longer, be, sufficient, power, to, operate, any, science, instruments, in, july, 2019, a, revised, power, management, plan, was, implemented, to, better, manage, the, two, probes, dwindling, power, supply, the, voyager, spacecraft, each, weigh, 773, kilograms, 1, 704, pounds, of, this, total, weight, each, spacecraft, carries, 105, kilograms, 231, pounds, of, scientific, instruments, the, identical, voyager, spacecraft, use, three, axis, stabilized, guidance, systems, that, use, gyroscopic, and, accelerometer, inputs, to, their, attitude, control, computers, to, point, their, high, gain, antennas, towards, the, earth, and, their, scientific, instruments, towards, their, targets, sometimes, with, the, help, of, a, movable, instrument, platform, for, the, smaller, instruments, and, the, electronic, photography, system, the, diagram, shows, the, high, gain, antenna, hga, with, a, 3, 7, m, 12, ft, diameter, dish, attached, to, the, hollow, decagonal, electronics, container, there, is, also, a, spherical, tank, that, contains, the, hydrazine, monopropellant, fuel, the, voyager, golden, record, is, attached, to, one, of, the, bus, sides, the, angled, square, panel, to, the, right, is, the, optical, calibration, target, and, excess, heat, radiator, the, three, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, rtgs, are, mounted, end, to, end, on, the, lower, boom, the, scan, platform, comprises, the, infrared, interferometer, spectrometer, iris, largest, camera, at, top, right, the, ultraviolet, spectrometer, uvs, just, above, the, iris, the, two, imaging, science, subsystem, iss, vidicon, cameras, to, the, left, of, the, uvs, and, the, photopolarimeter, system, pps, under, the, iss, only, five, investigation, teams, are, still, supported, though, data, is, collected, for, two, additional, instruments, the, flight, data, subsystem, fds, and, a, single, eight, track, digital, tape, recorder, dtr, provide, the, data, handling, functions, the, fds, configures, each, instrument, and, controls, instrument, operations, it, also, collects, engineering, and, science, data, and, formats, the, data, for, transmission, the, dtr, is, used, to, record, high, rate, plasma, wave, subsystem, pws, data, which, is, played, back, every, six, months, the, imaging, science, subsystem, made, up, of, a, wide, angle, and, a, narrow, angle, camera, is, a, modified, version, of, the, slow, scan, vidicon, camera, designs, that, were, used, in, the, earlier, mariner, flights, the, imaging, science, subsystem, consists, of, two, television, type, cameras, each, with, eight, filters, in, a, commandable, filter, wheel, mounted, in, front, of, the, vidicons, one, has, a, low, resolution, 200, mm, 7, 9, in, focal, length, wide, angle, lens, with, an, aperture, of, f, 3, the, wide, angle, camera, while, the, other, uses, a, higher, resolution, 1, 500, mm, 59, in, narrow, angle, f, 8, 5, lens, the, narrow, angle, camera, three, spacecraft, were, built, voyager, 1, vgr, 77, 1, voyager, 2, vgr, 77, 3, and, test, spare, model, vgr, 77, 2, there, are, three, different, computer, types, on, the, voyager, spacecraft, two, of, each, kind, sometimes, used, for, redundancy, they, are, proprietary, custom, built, computers, built, from, cmos, and, ttl, medium, scale, cmos, integrated, circuits, and, discrete, components, mostly, from, the, 7400, series, of, texas, instruments, total, number, of, words, among, the, six, computers, is, about, 32k, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, have, identical, computer, systems, the, computer, command, system, ccs, the, central, controller, of, the, spacecraft, has, two, 18, bit, word, interrupt, type, processors, with, 4096, words, each, of, non, volatile, plated, wire, memory, during, most, of, the, voyager, mission, the, two, ccs, computers, on, each, spacecraft, were, used, non, redundantly, to, increase, the, command, and, processing, capability, of, the, spacecraft, the, ccs, is, nearly, identical, to, the, system, flown, on, the, viking, spacecraft, the, flight, data, system, fds, is, two, 16, bit, word, machines, with, modular, memories, and, 8198, words, each, the, attitude, and, articulation, control, system, aacs, is, two, 18, bit, word, machines, with, 4096, words, each, unlike, the, other, on, board, instruments, the, operation, of, the, cameras, for, visible, light, is, not, autonomous, but, rather, it, is, controlled, by, an, imaging, parameter, table, contained, in, one, of, the, on, board, digital, computers, the, flight, data, subsystem, fds, more, recent, space, probes, since, about, 1990, usually, have, completely, autonomous, cameras, the, computer, command, subsystem, ccs, controls, the, cameras, the, ccs, contains, fixed, computer, programs, such, as, command, decoding, fault, detection, and, correction, routines, antenna, pointing, routines, and, spacecraft, sequencing, routines, this, computer, is, an, improved, version, of, the, one, that, was, used, in, the, viking, orbiter, the, hardware, in, both, custom, built, ccs, subsystems, in, the, voyagers, is, identical, there, is, only, a, minor, software, modification, for, one, of, them, that, has, a, scientific, subsystem, that, the, other, lacks, according, to, guinness, book, of, records, ccs, holds, record, of, longest, period, of, continual, operation, for, a, computer, it, has, been, running, continuously, since, 20, august, 1977, the, attitude, and, articulation, control, subsystem, aacs, controls, the, spacecraft, orientation, its, attitude, it, keeps, the, high, gain, antenna, pointing, towards, the, earth, controls, attitude, changes, and, points, the, scan, platform, the, custom, built, aacs, systems, on, both, craft, are, identical, it, has, been, erroneously, reported, on, the, internet, that, the, voyager, space, probes, were, controlled, by, a, version, of, the, rca, 1802, rca, cdp1802, cosmac, microprocessor, but, such, claims, are, not, supported, by, the, primary, design, documents, the, cdp1802, microprocessor, was, used, later, in, the, galileo, space, probe, which, was, designed, and, built, years, later, the, digital, control, electronics, of, the, voyagers, were, not, based, on, a, microprocessor, integrated, circuit, chip, the, uplink, communications, are, executed, via, s, band, microwave, communications, the, downlink, communications, are, carried, out, by, an, x, band, microwave, transmitter, on, board, the, spacecraft, with, an, s, band, transmitter, as, a, back, up, all, long, range, communications, to, and, from, the, two, voyagers, have, been, carried, out, using, their, 3, 7, meter, 12, ft, high, gain, antennas, the, high, gain, antenna, has, a, beamwidth, of, 0, 5, for, x, band, and, 2, 3, for, s, band, 17, the, low, gain, antenna, has, a, 7, db, gain, and, 60, beamwidth, 17, because, of, the, inverse, square, law, in, radio, communications, the, digital, data, rates, used, in, the, downlinks, from, the, voyagers, have, been, continually, decreasing, the, farther, that, they, get, from, the, earth, for, example, the, data, rate, used, from, jupiter, was, about, 115, 000, bits, per, second, that, was, halved, at, the, distance, of, saturn, and, it, has, gone, down, continually, since, then, some, measures, were, taken, on, the, ground, along, the, way, to, reduce, the, effects, of, the, inverse, square, law, in, between, 1982, and, 1985, the, diameters, of, the, three, main, parabolic, dish, antennas, of, the, deep, space, network, were, increased, from, 64, to, 70, m, 210, to, 230, ft, 34, dramatically, increasing, their, areas, for, gathering, weak, microwave, signals, whilst, the, craft, were, between, saturn, and, uranus, the, onboard, software, was, upgraded, to, do, a, degree, of, image, compression, and, to, use, a, more, efficient, reed, solomon, error, correcting, encoding, 33, then, between, 1986, and, 1989, new, techniques, were, brought, into, play, to, combine, the, signals, from, multiple, antennas, on, the, ground, into, one, more, powerful, signal, in, a, kind, of, an, antenna, array, 34, this, was, done, at, goldstone, california, canberra, australia, and, madrid, spain, using, the, additional, dish, antennas, available, there, also, in, australia, the, parkes, radio, telescope, was, brought, into, the, array, in, time, for, the, fly, by, of, neptune, in, 1989, in, the, united, states, the, very, large, array, in, new, mexico, was, brought, into, temporary, use, along, with, the, antennas, of, the, deep, space, network, at, goldstone, 34, using, this, new, technology, of, antenna, arrays, helped, to, compensate, for, the, immense, radio, distance, from, neptune, to, the, earth, electrical, power, is, supplied, by, three, mhw, rtg, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, rtgs, they, are, powered, by, plutonium, 238, distinct, from, the, pu, 239, isotope, used, in, nuclear, weapons, and, provided, approximately, 470, w, at, 30, volts, dc, when, the, spacecraft, was, launched, plutonium, 238, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 87, 74, years, so, rtgs, using, pu, 238, will, lose, a, factor, of, 1, 0, 5, 1, 87, 74, 0, 79, of, their, power, output, per, year, in, 2011, 34, years, after, launch, the, thermal, power, generated, by, such, an, rtg, would, be, reduced, to, 1, 2, 34, 87, 74, 76, of, its, initial, power, the, rtg, thermocouples, which, convert, thermal, power, into, electricity, also, degrade, over, time, reducing, available, electric, power, below, this, calculated, level, by, 7, october, 2011, the, power, generated, by, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, had, dropped, to, 267, 9, w, and, 269, 2, w, respectively, about, 57, of, the, power, at, launch, the, level, of, power, output, was, better, than, pre, launch, predictions, based, on, a, conservative, thermocouple, degradation, model, as, the, electrical, power, decreases, spacecraft, loads, must, be, turned, off, eliminating, some, capabilities, there, may, be, insufficient, power, for, communications, by, 2032, the, voyager, primary, mission, was, completed, in, 1989, with, the, close, flyby, of, neptune, by, voyager, 2, the, voyager, interstellar, mission, vim, is, a, mission, extension, which, began, when, the, two, spacecraft, had, already, been, in, flight, for, over, 12, years, the, heliophysics, division, of, the, nasa, science, mission, directorate, conducted, a, heliophysics, senior, review, in, 2008, the, panel, found, that, the, vim, is, a, mission, that, is, absolutely, imperative, to, continue, and, that, vim, funding, near, the, optimal, level, and, increased, dsn, deep, space, network, support, is, warranted, the, main, objective, of, the, vim, was, to, extend, the, exploration, of, the, solar, system, beyond, the, outer, planets, to, the, heliopause, the, farthest, extent, at, which, the, sun, s, radiation, predominates, over, interstellar, winds, and, if, possible, even, beyond, voyager, 1, crossed, the, heliopause, boundary, in, 2012, followed, by, voyager, 2, in, 2018, passing, through, the, heliopause, boundary, has, allowed, both, spacecraft, to, make, measurements, of, the, interstellar, fields, particles, and, waves, unaffected, by, the, solar, wind, two, significant, findings, so, far, have, been, the, discovery, of, a, region, of, magnetic, bubbles, and, no, indication, of, an, expected, shift, in, the, solar, magnetic, field, the, entire, voyager, 2, scan, platform, including, all, of, the, platform, instruments, was, switched, off, in, 1998, all, platform, instruments, on, voyager, 1, except, for, the, ultraviolet, spectrometer, uvs, have, also, been, switched, off, the, voyager, 1, scan, platform, was, scheduled, to, go, off, line, in, late, 2000, but, has, been, left, on, to, investigate, uv, emission, from, the, upwind, direction, uvs, data, are, still, captured, but, scans, are, no, longer, possible, gyro, operations, ended, in, 2016, for, voyager, 2, and, in, 2017, for, voyager, 1, gyro, operations, are, used, to, rotate, the, probe, 360, degrees, six, times, per, year, to, measure, the, magnetic, field, of, the, spacecraft, which, is, then, subtracted, from, the, magnetometer, science, data, the, two, spacecraft, continue, to, operate, with, some, loss, in, subsystem, redundancy, but, retain, the, capability, to, return, scientific, data, from, a, full, complement, of, voyager, interstellar, mission, vim, science, instruments, both, spacecraft, also, have, adequate, electrical, power, and, attitude, control, propellant, to, continue, operating, until, around, 2025, after, which, there, may, not, be, electrical, power, to, support, science, instrument, operation, science, data, return, and, spacecraft, operations, will, cease, by, the, start, of, vim, voyager, 1, was, at, a, distance, of, 40, au, from, the, earth, while, voyager, 2, was, at, 31, au, vim, is, in, three, phases, termination, shock, heliosheath, exploration, and, interstellar, exploration, phase, the, spacecraft, began, vim, in, an, environment, controlled, by, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, with, the, plasma, particles, being, dominated, by, those, contained, in, the, expanding, supersonic, solar, wind, this, is, the, characteristic, environment, of, the, termination, shock, phase, at, some, distance, from, the, sun, the, supersonic, solar, wind, will, be, held, back, from, further, expansion, by, the, interstellar, wind, the, first, feature, encountered, by, a, spacecraft, as, a, result, of, this, interaction, between, interstellar, wind, and, solar, wind, was, the, termination, shock, where, the, solar, wind, slows, to, subsonic, speed, and, large, changes, in, plasma, flow, direction, and, magnetic, field, orientation, occur, voyager, 1, completed, the, phase, of, termination, shock, in, december, 2004, at, a, distance, of, 94, au, while, voyager, 2, completed, it, in, august, 2007, at, a, distance, of, 84, au, after, entering, into, the, heliosheath, the, spacecraft, were, in, an, area, that, is, dominated, by, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, and, solar, wind, particles, after, passing, through, the, heliosheath, the, two, voyagers, began, the, phase, of, interstellar, exploration, the, outer, boundary, of, the, heliosheath, is, called, the, heliopause, this, is, the, region, where, the, sun, s, influence, begins, to, decrease, and, interstellar, space, can, be, detected, voyager, 1, is, escaping, the, solar, system, at, the, speed, of, 3, 6, au, per, year, 35,

voyager, spacecraft, will, eventually, go, on, to, the, stars, in, about, 40, 000, years, voyager, 1, will, be, within, 1, 6, light, years, ly, of, ac, 79, 3888, also, known, as, gliese, 445, which, is, approaching, the, sun, in, 40, 000, years, voyager, 2, will, be, within, 1, 7, ly, of, ross, 248, another, star, which, is, approaching, the, sun, and, in, 296, 000, years, it, will, pass, within, 4, 6, ly, of, sirius, which, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, the, spacecraft, are, not, expected, to, collide, with, a, star, for, 1, sextillion, 10, 20, years, in, october, 2020, astronomers, reported, a, significant, unexpected, increase, in, density, in, the, space, beyond, the, solar, system, as, detected, by, the, voyager, space, probes, according, to, the, researchers, this, implies, that, the, density, gradient, is, a, large, scale, feature, of, the, vlism, very, local, interstellar, medium, in, the, general, direction, of, the, heliospheric, nose, both, spacecraft, carry, a, 12, inch, 30, cm, golden, phonograph, record, that, contains, pictures, and, sounds, of, earth, symbolic, directions, on, the, cover, for, playing, the, record, and, data, detailing, the, location, of, earth, the, record, is, intended, as, a, combination, time, capsule, and, an, interstellar, message, to, any, civilization, alien, or, far, future, human, that, may, recover, either, of, the, voyagers, the, contents, of, this, record, were, selected, by, a, committee, that, included, timothy, ferris, and, was, chaired, by, carl, sagan, pale, blue, dot, is, a, photograph, of, earth, taken, on, february, 14, 1990, by, the, voyager, 1, space, probe, from, a, distance, of, approximately, 6, billion, kilometers, 3, 7, billion, miles, 40, 5, au, as, part, of, that, day, s, family, portrait, series, of, images, of, the, solar, system, the, voyager, program, s, discoveries, during, the, primary, phase, of, its, mission, including, new, close, up, color, photos, of, the, major, planets, were, regularly, documented, by, print, and, electronic, media, outlets, among, the, best, known, of, these, is, an, image, of, the, earth, as, a, pale, blue, dot, taken, in, 1990, by, voyager, 1, and, popularized, by, carl, sagan, consider, again, that, dot, that, s, here, that, s, home, that, s, us, the, earth, is, a, very, small, stage, in, a, vast, cosmic, arena, to, my, mind, there, is, perhaps, no, better, demonstration, of, the, folly, of, human, conceits, than, this, distant, image, of, our, tiny, world, to, me, it, underscores, our, responsibility, to, deal, more, kindly, and, compassionately, with, one, another, and, to, preserve, and, cherish, that, pale, blue, dot, the, only, home, we, ve, ever, known, nasa, sites, nasa, instrument,
