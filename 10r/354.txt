the, wheel, and, axle, is, a, simple, machine, consisting, of, a, wheel, attached, to, a, smaller, axle, so, that, these, two, parts, rotate, together, in, which, a, force, is, transferred, from, one, to, the, other, the, wheel, and, axle, can, be, viewed, as, a, version, of, the, lever, with, a, drive, force, applied, tangentially, to, the, perimeter, of, the, wheel, and, a, load, force, applied, to, the, axle, supported, in, a, bearing, which, serves, as, a, fulcrum, the, halaf, culture, of, 6500, 5100, bce, has, been, credited, with, the, earliest, depiction, of, a, wheeled, vehicle, but, this, is, doubtful, as, there, is, no, evidence, of, halafians, using, either, wheeled, vehicles, or, even, pottery, wheels, one, of, the, first, applications, of, the, wheel, to, appear, was, the, potter, s, wheel, used, by, prehistoric, cultures, to, fabricate, clay, pots, the, earliest, type, known, as, tournettes, or, slow, wheels, were, known, in, the, middle, east, by, the, 5th, millennium, bce, one, of, the, earliest, examples, was, discovered, at, tepe, pardis, iran, and, dated, to, 5200, 4700, bce, these, were, made, of, stone, or, clay, and, secured, to, the, ground, with, a, peg, in, the, center, but, required, significant, effort, to, turn, true, potter, s, wheels, which, are, freely, spinning, and, have, a, wheel, and, axle, mechanism, were, developed, in, mesopotamia, iraq, by, 4200, 4000, bce, the, oldest, surviving, example, which, was, found, in, ur, modern, day, iraq, dates, to, approximately, 3100, bce, evidence, of, wheeled, vehicles, appeared, by, the, late, 4th, millennium, bce, depictions, of, wheeled, wagons, found, on, clay, tablet, pictographs, at, the, eanna, district, of, uruk, in, the, sumerian, civilization, of, mesopotamia, are, dated, between, 3700, 3500, bce, in, the, second, half, of, the, 4th, millennium, bce, evidence, of, wheeled, vehicles, appeared, near, simultaneously, in, the, northern, caucasus, maykop, culture, and, eastern, europe, cucuteni, trypillian, culture, depictions, of, a, wheeled, vehicle, appeared, between, 3500, and, 3350, bce, in, the, bronocice, clay, pot, excavated, in, a, funnelbeaker, culture, settlement, in, southern, poland, in, nearby, olszanica, a, 2, 2, m, wide, door, was, constructed, for, wagon, entry, this, barn, was, 40, m, long, and, had, 3, doors, surviving, evidence, of, a, wheel, axle, combination, from, stare, gmajne, near, ljubljana, in, slovenia, ljubljana, marshes, wooden, wheel, is, dated, within, two, standard, deviations, to, 3340, 3030, bce, the, axle, to, 3360, 3045, bce, two, types, of, early, neolithic, european, wheel, and, axle, are, known, a, circumalpine, type, of, wagon, construction, the, wheel, and, axle, rotate, together, as, in, ljubljana, marshes, wheel, and, that, of, the, baden, culture, in, hungary, axle, does, not, rotate, they, both, are, dated, to, c, 3200, 3000, bce, historians, believe, that, there, was, a, diffusion, of, the, wheeled, vehicle, from, the, near, east, to, europe, around, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bce, an, early, example, of, a, wooden, wheel, and, its, axle, was, found, in, 2002, at, the, ljubljana, marshes, some, 20, km, south, of, ljubljana, the, capital, of, slovenia, according, to, radiocarbon, dating, it, is, between, 5, 100, and, 5, 350, years, old, the, wheel, was, made, of, ash, and, oak, and, had, a, radius, of, 70, cm, and, the, axle, was, 120, cm, long, and, made, of, oak, in, china, the, earliest, evidence, of, spoked, wheels, comes, from, qinghai, in, the, form, of, two, wheel, hubs, from, a, site, dated, between, 2000, and, 1500, bce, in, roman, egypt, hero, of, alexandria, identified, the, wheel, and, axle, as, one, of, the, simple, machines, used, to, lift, weights, this, is, thought, to, have, been, in, the, form, of, the, windlass, which, consists, of, a, crank, or, pulley, connected, to, a, cylindrical, barrel, that, provides, mechanical, advantage, to, wind, up, a, rope, and, lift, a, load, such, as, a, bucket, from, the, well, the, wheel, and, axle, was, identified, as, one, of, six, simple, machines, by, renaissance, scientists, drawing, from, greek, texts, on, technology, the, simple, machine, called, a, wheel, and, axle, refers, to, the, assembly, formed, by, two, disks, or, cylinders, of, different, diameters, mounted, so, they, rotate, together, around, the, same, axis, the, thin, rod, which, needs, to, be, turned, is, called, the, axle, and, the, wider, object, fixed, to, the, axle, on, which, we, apply, force, is, called, the, wheel, a, tangential, force, applied, to, the, periphery, of, the, large, disk, can, exert, a, larger, force, on, a, load, attached, to, the, axle, achieving, mechanical, advantage, when, used, as, the, wheel, of, a, wheeled, vehicle, the, smaller, cylinder, is, the, axle, of, the, wheel, but, when, used, in, a, windlass, winch, and, other, similar, applications, see, medieval, mining, lift, to, right, the, smaller, cylinder, may, be, separate, from, the, axle, mounted, in, the, bearings, it, cannot, be, used, separately, assuming, the, wheel, and, axle, does, not, dissipate, or, store, energy, that, is, it, has, no, friction, or, elasticity, the, power, input, by, the, force, applied, to, the, wheel, must, equal, the, power, output, at, the, axle, as, the, wheel, and, axle, system, rotates, around, its, bearings, points, on, the, circumference, or, edge, of, the, wheel, move, faster, than, points, on, the, circumference, or, edge, of, the, axle, therefore, a, force, applied, to, the, edge, of, the, wheel, must, be, less, than, the, force, applied, to, the, edge, of, the, axle, because, power, is, the, product, of, force, and, velocity, let, a, and, b, be, the, distances, from, the, center, of, the, bearing, to, the, edges, of, the, wheel, a, and, the, axle, b, if, the, input, force, f, a, is, applied, to, the, edge, of, the, wheel, a, and, the, force, f, b, at, the, edge, of, the, axle, b, is, the, output, then, the, ratio, of, the, velocities, of, points, a, and, b, is, given, by, a, b, so, the, ratio, of, the, output, force, to, the, input, force, or, mechanical, advantage, is, given, by, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, simple, machine, like, the, wheel, and, axle, is, computed, as, the, ratio, of, the, resistance, to, the, effort, the, larger, the, ratio, the, greater, the, multiplication, of, force, torque, created, or, distance, achieved, by, varying, the, radii, of, the, axle, and, or, wheel, any, amount, of, mechanical, advantage, may, be, gained, in, this, manner, the, size, of, the, wheel, may, be, increased, to, an, inconvenient, extent, in, this, case, a, system, or, combination, of, wheels, often, toothed, that, is, gears, are, used, as, a, wheel, and, axle, is, a, type, of, lever, a, system, of, wheels, and, axles, is, like, a, compound, lever, on, a, powered, wheeled, vehicle, the, transmission, exerts, a, force, on, the, axle, which, has, a, smaller, radius, than, the, wheel, the, mechanical, advantage, is, therefore, much, less, than, 1, the, wheel, and, axle, of, a, car, are, therefore, not, representative, of, a, simple, machine, whose, purpose, is, to, increase, the, force, the, friction, between, wheel, and, road, is, actually, quite, low, so, even, a, small, force, exerted, on, the, axle, is, sufficient, the, actual, advantage, lies, in, the, large, rotational, speed, at, which, the, axle, is, rotating, thanks, to, the, transmission, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, wheel, and, axle, with, no, friction, is, called, the, ideal, mechanical, advantage, ima, it, is, calculated, with, the, following, formula, all, actual, wheels, have, friction, which, dissipates, some, of, the, power, as, heat, the, actual, mechanical, advantage, ama, of, a, wheel, and, axle, is, calculated, with, the, following, formula, where, basic, machines, and, how, they, work, united, states, bureau, of, naval,
