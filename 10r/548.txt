biological, warfare, also, known, as, germ, warfare, is, the, use, of, biological, toxins, or, infectious, agents, such, as, bacteria, viruses, insects, and, fungi, with, the, intent, to, kill, harm, or, incapacitate, humans, animals, or, plants, as, an, act, of, war, biological, weapons, often, termed, bio, weapons, biological, threat, agents, or, bio, agents, are, living, organisms, or, replicating, entities, i, e, viruses, which, are, not, universally, considered, alive, entomological, insect, warfare, is, a, subtype, of, biological, warfare, biological, warfare, is, subject, to, a, forceful, normative, prohibition, offensive, biological, warfare, in, international, armed, conflicts, is, a, war, crime, under, the, 1925, geneva, protocol, and, several, international, humanitarian, law, treaties, in, particular, the, 1972, biological, weapons, convention, bwc, bans, the, development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling, and, use, of, biological, weapons, in, contrast, defensive, biological, research, for, prophylactic, protective, or, other, peaceful, purposes, is, not, prohibited, by, the, bwc, biological, warfare, is, distinct, from, warfare, involving, other, types, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, wmd, including, nuclear, warfare, chemical, warfare, and, radiological, warfare, none, of, these, are, considered, conventional, weapons, which, are, deployed, primarily, for, their, explosive, kinetic, or, incendiary, potential, biological, weapons, may, be, employed, in, various, ways, to, gain, a, strategic, or, tactical, advantage, over, the, enemy, either, by, threats, or, by, actual, deployments, like, some, chemical, weapons, biological, weapons, may, also, be, useful, as, area, denial, weapons, these, agents, may, be, lethal, or, non, lethal, and, may, be, targeted, against, a, single, individual, a, group, of, people, or, even, an, entire, population, they, may, be, developed, acquired, stockpiled, or, deployed, by, nation, states, or, by, non, national, groups, in, the, latter, case, or, if, a, nation, state, uses, it, clandestinely, it, may, also, be, considered, bioterrorism, biological, warfare, and, chemical, warfare, overlap, to, an, extent, as, the, use, of, toxins, produced, by, some, living, organisms, is, considered, under, the, provisions, of, both, the, bwc, and, the, chemical, weapons, convention, toxins, and, psychochemical, weapons, are, often, referred, to, as, midspectrum, agents, unlike, bioweapons, these, midspectrum, agents, do, not, reproduce, in, their, host, and, are, typically, characterized, by, shorter, incubation, periods, a, biological, attack, could, conceivably, result, in, large, numbers, of, civilian, casualties, and, cause, severe, disruption, to, economic, and, societal, infrastructure, a, nation, or, group, that, can, pose, a, credible, threat, of, mass, casualty, has, the, ability, to, alter, the, terms, under, which, other, nations, or, groups, interact, with, it, when, indexed, to, weapon, mass, and, cost, of, development, and, storage, biological, weapons, possess, destructive, potential, and, loss, of, life, far, in, excess, of, nuclear, chemical, or, conventional, weapons, accordingly, biological, agents, are, potentially, useful, as, strategic, deterrents, in, addition, to, their, utility, as, offensive, weapons, on, the, battlefield, as, a, tactical, weapon, for, military, use, a, significant, problem, with, biological, warfare, is, that, it, would, take, days, to, be, effective, and, therefore, might, not, immediately, stop, an, opposing, force, some, biological, agents, smallpox, pneumonic, plague, have, the, capability, of, person, to, person, transmission, via, aerosolized, respiratory, droplets, this, feature, can, be, undesirable, as, the, agent, s, may, be, transmitted, by, this, mechanism, to, unintended, populations, including, neutral, or, even, friendly, forces, worse, still, such, a, weapon, could, escape, the, laboratory, where, it, was, developed, even, if, there, was, no, intent, to, use, it, for, example, by, infecting, a, researcher, who, then, transmits, it, to, the, outside, world, before, realizing, that, they, were, infected, several, cases, are, known, of, researchers, becoming, infected, and, dying, of, ebola, which, they, had, been, working, with, in, the, lab, though, nobody, else, was, infected, in, those, cases, while, there, is, no, evidence, that, their, work, was, directed, towards, biological, warfare, it, demonstrates, the, potential, for, accidental, infection, even, of, careful, researchers, fully, aware, of, the, dangers, while, containment, of, biological, warfare, is, less, of, a, concern, for, certain, criminal, or, terrorist, organizations, it, remains, a, significant, concern, for, the, military, and, civilian, populations, of, virtually, all, nations, rudimentary, forms, of, biological, warfare, have, been, practiced, since, antiquity, the, earliest, documented, incident, of, the, intention, to, use, biological, weapons, is, recorded, in, hittite, texts, of, 1500, 1200, bce, in, which, victims, of, an, unknown, plague, possibly, tularemia, were, driven, into, enemy, lands, causing, an, epidemic, the, assyrians, poisoned, enemy, wells, with, the, fungus, ergot, though, with, unknown, results, scythian, archers, dipped, their, arrows, and, roman, soldiers, their, swords, into, excrements, and, cadavers, victims, were, commonly, infected, by, tetanus, as, result, in, 1346, the, bodies, of, mongol, warriors, of, the, golden, horde, who, had, died, of, plague, were, thrown, over, the, walls, of, the, besieged, crimean, city, of, kaffa, specialists, disagree, about, whether, this, operation, was, responsible, for, the, spread, of, the, black, death, into, europe, near, east, and, north, africa, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, approximately, 25, million, europeans, biological, agents, were, extensively, used, in, many, parts, of, africa, from, the, sixteenth, century, ad, most, of, the, time, in, the, form, of, poisoned, arrows, or, powder, spread, on, the, war, front, as, well, as, poisoning, of, horses, and, water, supply, of, the, enemy, forces, in, borgu, there, were, specific, mixtures, to, kill, hypnotize, make, the, enemy, bold, and, to, act, as, an, antidote, against, the, poison, of, the, enemy, as, well, the, creation, of, biologicals, was, reserved, for, a, specific, and, professional, class, of, medicine, men, during, the, french, and, indian, war, in, june, 1763, a, group, of, native, americans, laid, siege, to, british, held, fort, pitt, the, commander, of, fort, pitt, simeon, ecuyer, ordered, his, men, to, take, smallpox, infested, blankets, from, the, infirmary, and, give, it, to, a, lenape, delegation, during, the, siege, a, reported, outbreak, that, began, the, spring, before, left, as, many, as, one, hundred, native, americans, dead, in, ohio, country, from, 1763, to, 1764, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, smallpox, was, a, result, of, the, fort, pitt, incident, or, the, virus, was, already, present, among, the, delaware, people, as, outbreaks, happened, on, their, own, every, dozen, or, so, years, and, the, delegates, were, met, again, later, and, seemingly, had, not, contracted, smallpox, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, continental, army, officer, george, washington, mentioned, to, the, continental, congress, that, he, had, heard, a, rumor, from, a, sailor, that, his, opponent, during, the, siege, of, boston, general, william, howe, had, deliberately, sent, civilians, out, of, the, city, in, the, hopes, of, spreading, the, ongoing, smallpox, epidemic, to, american, lines, washington, remaining, unconvinced, wrote, that, he, could, hardly, give, credit, to, the, claim, washington, had, already, inoculated, his, soldiers, diminishing, the, effect, of, the, epidemic, some, historians, have, claimed, that, a, detachment, of, the, corps, of, royal, marines, stationed, in, new, south, wales, australia, deliberately, used, smallpox, there, in, 1789, dr, seth, carus, states, ultimately, we, have, a, strong, circumstantial, case, supporting, the, theory, that, someone, deliberately, introduced, smallpox, in, the, aboriginal, population, by, 1900, the, germ, theory, and, advances, in, bacteriology, brought, a, new, level, of, sophistication, to, the, techniques, for, possible, use, of, bio, agents, in, war, biological, sabotage, in, the, form, of, anthrax, and, glanders, was, undertaken, on, behalf, of, the, imperial, german, government, during, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, with, indifferent, results, the, geneva, protocol, of, 1925, prohibited, the, first, use, of, chemical, and, biological, weapons, against, enemy, nationals, in, international, armed, conflicts, with, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, the, ministry, of, supply, in, the, united, kingdom, established, a, biological, warfare, program, at, porton, down, headed, by, the, microbiologist, paul, fildes, the, research, was, championed, by, winston, churchill, and, soon, tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and, botulism, toxins, had, been, effectively, weaponized, in, particular, gruinard, island, in, scotland, was, contaminated, with, anthrax, during, a, series, of, extensive, tests, for, the, next, 56, years, although, the, uk, never, offensively, used, the, biological, weapons, it, developed, its, program, was, the, first, to, successfully, weaponize, a, variety, of, deadly, pathogens, and, bring, them, into, industrial, production, other, nations, notably, france, and, japan, had, begun, their, own, biological, weapons, programs, when, the, united, states, entered, the, war, allied, resources, were, pooled, at, the, request, of, the, british, the, u, s, then, established, a, large, research, program, and, industrial, complex, at, fort, detrick, maryland, in, 1942, under, the, direction, of, george, w, merck, the, biological, and, chemical, weapons, developed, during, that, period, were, tested, at, the, dugway, proving, grounds, in, utah, soon, there, were, facilities, for, the, mass, production, of, anthrax, spores, brucellosis, and, botulism, toxins, although, the, war, was, over, before, these, weapons, could, be, of, much, operational, use, the, most, notorious, program, of, the, period, was, run, by, the, secret, imperial, japanese, army, unit, 731, during, the, war, based, at, pingfan, in, manchuria, and, commanded, by, lieutenant, general, shir, ishii, this, biological, warfare, research, unit, conducted, often, fatal, human, experiments, on, prisoners, and, produced, biological, weapons, for, combat, use, although, the, japanese, effort, lacked, the, technological, sophistication, of, the, american, or, british, programs, it, far, outstripped, them, in, its, widespread, application, and, indiscriminate, brutality, biological, weapons, were, used, against, chinese, soldiers, and, civilians, in, several, military, campaigns, in, 1940, the, japanese, army, air, force, bombed, ningbo, with, ceramic, bombs, full, of, fleas, carrying, the, bubonic, plague, many, of, these, operations, were, ineffective, due, to, inefficient, delivery, systems, although, up, to, 400, 000, people, may, have, died, during, the, zhejiang, jiangxi, campaign, in, 1942, around, 1, 700, japanese, troops, died, out, of, a, total, 10, 000, japanese, soldiers, who, fell, ill, with, disease, when, their, own, biological, weapons, attack, rebounded, on, their, own, forces, during, the, final, months, of, world, war, ii, japan, planned, to, use, plague, as, a, biological, weapon, against, u, s, civilians, in, san, diego, california, during, operation, cherry, blossoms, at, night, the, plan, was, set, to, launch, on, 22, september, 1945, but, it, was, not, executed, because, of, japan, s, surrender, on, 15, august, 1945, in, britain, the, 1950s, saw, the, weaponization, of, plague, brucellosis, tularemia, and, later, equine, encephalomyelitis, and, vaccinia, viruses, but, the, programme, was, unilaterally, cancelled, in, 1956, the, united, states, army, biological, warfare, laboratories, weaponized, anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, q, fever, and, others, in, 1969, us, president, richard, nixon, decided, to, unilaterally, terminate, the, offensive, biological, weapons, program, of, the, us, allowing, only, scientific, research, for, defensive, measures, this, decision, increased, the, momentum, of, the, negotiations, for, a, ban, on, biological, warfare, which, took, place, from, 1969, to, 1972, in, the, united, nation, s, conference, of, the, committee, on, disarmament, in, geneva, these, negotiations, resulted, in, the, biological, weapons, convention, which, was, opened, for, signature, on, 10, april, 1972, and, entered, into, force, on, 26, march, 1975, after, its, ratification, by, 22, states, despite, being, a, party, and, depositary, to, the, bwc, the, soviet, union, continued, and, expanded, its, massive, offensive, biological, weapons, program, under, the, leadership, of, the, allegedly, civilian, institution, biopreparat, the, soviet, union, attracted, international, suspicion, after, the, 1979, sverdlovsk, anthrax, leak, killed, approximately, 65, to, 100, people, according, to, historians, benny, morris, and, benjamin, kedar, israel, conducted, a, biological, warfare, operation, codenamed, cast, thy, bread, during, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, the, haganah, initially, used, typhoid, bacteria, to, contaminate, water, wells, in, newly, cleared, arab, villages, to, prevent, the, population, including, militiamen, from, returning, later, the, biological, warfare, campaign, expanded, to, include, jewish, settlements, that, were, in, imminent, danger, of, being, captured, by, arab, troops, and, inhabited, arab, towns, not, slated, for, capture, there, was, also, plans, to, expand, the, biological, warfare, campaign, into, other, arab, states, including, egypt, lebanon, and, syria, but, they, were, not, carried, out, international, restrictions, on, biological, warfare, began, with, the, 1925, geneva, protocol, which, prohibits, the, use, but, not, the, possession, or, development, of, biological, and, chemical, weapons, in, international, armed, conflicts, upon, ratification, of, the, geneva, protocol, several, countries, made, reservations, regarding, its, applicability, and, use, in, retaliation, due, to, these, reservations, it, was, in, practice, a, no, first, use, agreement, only, the, 1972, biological, weapons, convention, bwc, supplements, the, geneva, protocol, by, prohibiting, the, development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling, and, use, of, biological, weapons, having, entered, into, force, on, 26, march, 1975, the, bwc, was, the, first, multilateral, disarmament, treaty, to, ban, the, production, of, an, entire, category, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, as, of, march, 2021, 183, states, have, become, party, to, the, treaty, the, bwc, is, considered, to, have, established, a, strong, global, norm, against, biological, weapons, which, is, reflected, in, the, treaty, s, preamble, stating, that, the, use, of, biological, weapons, would, be, repugnant, to, the, conscience, of, mankind, the, bwc, s, effectiveness, has, been, limited, due, to, insufficient, institutional, support, and, the, absence, of, any, formal, verification, regime, to, monitor, compliance, in, 1985, the, australia, group, was, established, a, multilateral, export, control, regime, of, 43, countries, aiming, to, prevent, the, proliferation, of, chemical, and, biological, weapons, in, 2004, the, united, nations, security, council, passed, resolution, 1540, which, obligates, all, un, member, states, to, develop, and, enforce, appropriate, legal, and, regulatory, measures, against, the, proliferation, of, chemical, biological, radiological, and, nuclear, weapons, and, their, means, of, delivery, in, particular, to, prevent, the, spread, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, to, non, state, actors, biological, weapons, are, difficult, to, detect, economical, and, easy, to, use, making, them, appealing, to, terrorists, the, cost, of, a, biological, weapon, is, estimated, to, be, about, 0, 05, percent, the, cost, of, a, conventional, weapon, in, order, to, produce, similar, numbers, of, mass, casualties, per, kilometer, square, moreover, their, production, is, very, easy, as, common, technology, can, be, used, to, produce, biological, warfare, agents, like, that, used, in, production, of, vaccines, foods, spray, devices, beverages, and, antibiotics, a, major, factor, in, biological, warfare, that, attracts, terrorists, is, that, they, can, easily, escape, before, the, government, agencies, or, secret, agencies, have, even, started, their, investigation, this, is, because, the, potential, organism, has, an, incubation, period, of, 3, to, 7, days, after, which, the, results, begin, to, appear, thereby, giving, terrorists, a, lead, a, technique, called, clustered, regularly, interspaced, short, palindromic, repeat, crispr, cas9, is, now, so, cheap, and, widely, available, that, scientists, fear, that, amateurs, will, start, experimenting, with, them, in, this, technique, a, dna, sequence, is, cut, off, and, replaced, with, a, new, sequence, e, g, one, that, codes, for, a, particular, protein, with, the, intent, of, modifying, an, organism, s, traits, concerns, have, emerged, regarding, do, it, yourself, biology, research, organizations, due, to, their, associated, risk, that, a, rogue, amateur, diy, researcher, could, attempt, to, develop, dangerous, bioweapons, using, genome, editing, technology, in, 2002, when, cnn, went, through, al, qaeda, s, aq, s, experiments, with, crude, poisons, they, found, out, that, aq, had, begun, planning, ricin, and, cyanide, attacks, with, the, help, of, a, loose, association, of, terrorist, cells, the, associates, had, infiltrated, many, countries, like, turkey, italy, spain, france, and, others, in, 2015, to, combat, the, threat, of, bioterrorism, a, national, blueprint, for, biodefense, was, issued, by, the, blue, ribbon, study, panel, on, biodefense, also, 233, potential, exposures, of, select, biological, agents, outside, of, the, primary, barriers, of, the, biocontainment, in, the, us, were, described, by, the, annual, report, of, the, federal, select, agent, program, though, a, verification, system, can, reduce, bioterrorism, an, employee, or, a, lone, terrorist, having, adequate, knowledge, of, a, bio, technology, company, s, facilities, can, cause, potential, danger, by, utilizing, without, proper, oversight, and, supervision, that, company, s, resources, moreover, it, has, been, found, that, about, 95, of, accidents, that, have, occurred, due, to, low, security, have, been, done, by, employees, or, those, who, had, a, security, clearance, entomological, warfare, ew, is, a, type, of, biological, warfare, that, uses, insects, to, attack, the, enemy, the, concept, has, existed, for, centuries, and, research, and, development, have, continued, into, the, modern, era, ew, has, been, used, in, battle, by, japan, and, several, other, nations, have, developed, and, been, accused, of, using, an, entomological, warfare, program, ew, may, employ, insects, in, a, direct, attack, or, as, vectors, to, deliver, a, biological, agent, such, as, plague, essentially, ew, exists, in, three, varieties, one, type, of, ew, involves, infecting, insects, with, a, pathogen, and, then, dispersing, the, insects, over, target, areas, the, insects, then, act, as, a, vector, infecting, any, person, or, animal, they, might, bite, another, type, of, ew, is, a, direct, insect, attack, against, crops, the, insect, may, not, be, infected, with, any, pathogen, but, instead, represents, a, threat, to, agriculture, the, final, method, uses, uninfected, insects, such, as, bees, or, wasps, to, directly, attack, the, enemy, theoretically, novel, approaches, in, biotechnology, such, as, synthetic, biology, could, be, used, in, the, future, to, design, novel, types, of, biological, warfare, agents, most, of, the, biosecurity, concerns, in, synthetic, biology, are, focused, on, the, role, of, dna, synthesis, and, the, risk, of, producing, genetic, material, of, lethal, viruses, e, g, 1918, spanish, flu, polio, in, the, lab, recently, the, crispr, cas, system, has, emerged, as, a, promising, technique, for, gene, editing, it, was, hailed, by, the, washington, post, as, the, most, important, innovation, in, the, synthetic, biology, space, in, nearly, 30, years, while, other, methods, take, months, or, years, to, edit, gene, sequences, crispr, speeds, that, time, up, to, weeks, due, to, its, ease, of, use, and, accessibility, it, has, raised, a, number, of, ethical, concerns, especially, surrounding, its, use, in, the, biohacking, space, ideal, characteristics, of, a, biological, agent, to, be, used, as, a, weapon, against, humans, are, high, infectivity, high, virulence, non, availability, of, vaccines, and, availability, of, an, effective, and, efficient, delivery, system, stability, of, the, weaponized, agent, the, ability, of, the, agent, to, retain, its, infectivity, and, virulence, after, a, prolonged, period, of, storage, may, also, be, desirable, particularly, for, military, applications, and, the, ease, of, creating, one, is, often, considered, control, of, the, spread, of, the, agent, may, be, another, desired, characteristic, the, primary, difficulty, is, not, the, production, of, the, biological, agent, as, many, biological, agents, used, in, weapons, can, be, manufactured, relatively, quickly, cheaply, and, easily, rather, it, is, the, weaponization, storage, and, delivery, in, an, effective, vehicle, to, a, vulnerable, target, that, pose, significant, problems, for, example, bacillus, anthracis, is, considered, an, effective, agent, for, several, reasons, first, it, forms, hardy, spores, perfect, for, dispersal, aerosols, second, this, organism, is, not, considered, transmissible, from, person, to, person, and, thus, rarely, if, ever, causes, secondary, infections, a, pulmonary, anthrax, infection, starts, with, ordinary, influenza, like, symptoms, and, progresses, to, a, lethal, hemorrhagic, mediastinitis, within, 3, 7, days, with, a, fatality, rate, that, is, 90, or, higher, in, untreated, patients, finally, friendly, personnel, and, civilians, can, be, protected, with, suitable, antibiotics, agents, considered, for, weaponization, or, known, to, be, weaponized, include, bacteria, such, as, bacillus, anthracis, brucella, spp, burkholderia, mallei, burkholderia, pseudomallei, chlamydophila, psittaci, coxiella, burnetii, francisella, tularensis, some, of, the, rickettsiaceae, especially, rickettsia, prowazekii, and, rickettsia, rickettsii, shigella, spp, vibrio, cholerae, and, yersinia, pestis, many, viral, agents, have, been, studied, and, or, weaponized, including, some, of, the, bunyaviridae, especially, rift, valley, fever, virus, ebolavirus, many, of, the, flaviviridae, especially, japanese, encephalitis, virus, machupo, virus, coronaviruses, marburg, virus, variola, virus, and, yellow, fever, virus, fungal, agents, that, have, been, studied, include, coccidioides, spp, toxins, that, can, be, used, as, weapons, include, ricin, staphylococcal, enterotoxin, b, botulinum, toxin, saxitoxin, and, many, mycotoxins, these, toxins, and, the, organisms, that, produce, them, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, select, agents, in, the, united, states, their, possession, use, and, transfer, are, regulated, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, s, select, agent, program, the, former, us, biological, warfare, program, categorized, its, weaponized, anti, personnel, bio, agents, as, either, lethal, agents, bacillus, anthracis, francisella, tularensis, botulinum, toxin, or, incapacitating, agents, brucella, suis, coxiella, burnetii, venezuelan, equine, encephalitis, virus, staphylococcal, enterotoxin, b, the, united, states, developed, an, anti, crop, capability, during, the, cold, war, that, used, plant, diseases, bioherbicides, or, mycoherbicides, for, destroying, enemy, agriculture, biological, weapons, also, target, fisheries, as, well, as, water, based, vegetation, it, was, believed, that, the, destruction, of, enemy, agriculture, on, a, strategic, scale, could, thwart, sino, soviet, aggression, in, a, general, war, diseases, such, as, wheat, blast, and, rice, blast, were, weaponized, in, aerial, spray, tanks, and, cluster, bombs, for, delivery, to, enemy, watersheds, in, agricultural, regions, to, initiate, epiphytotic, epidemics, among, plants, on, the, other, hand, some, sources, report, that, these, agents, were, stockpiled, but, never, weaponized, when, the, united, states, renounced, its, offensive, biological, warfare, program, in, 1969, and, 1970, the, vast, majority, of, its, biological, arsenal, was, composed, of, these, plant, diseases, enterotoxins, and, mycotoxins, were, not, affected, by, nixon, s, order, though, herbicides, are, chemicals, they, are, often, grouped, with, biological, warfare, and, chemical, warfare, because, they, may, work, in, a, similar, manner, as, biotoxins, or, bioregulators, the, army, biological, laboratory, tested, each, agent, and, the, army, s, technical, escort, unit, was, responsible, for, the, transport, of, all, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, materials, biological, warfare, can, also, specifically, target, plants, to, destroy, crops, or, defoliate, vegetation, the, united, states, and, britain, discovered, plant, growth, regulators, i, e, herbicides, during, the, second, world, war, which, were, then, used, by, the, uk, in, the, counterinsurgency, operations, of, the, malayan, emergency, inspired, by, the, use, in, malaysia, the, us, military, effort, in, the, vietnam, war, included, a, mass, dispersal, of, a, variety, of, herbicides, famously, agent, orange, with, the, aim, of, destroying, farmland, and, defoliating, forests, used, as, cover, by, the, viet, cong, sri, lanka, deployed, military, defoliants, in, its, prosecution, of, the, eelam, war, against, tamil, insurgents, during, world, war, i, german, saboteurs, used, anthrax, and, glanders, to, sicken, cavalry, horses, in, u, s, and, france, sheep, in, romania, and, livestock, in, argentina, intended, for, the, entente, forces, one, of, these, german, saboteurs, was, anton, dilger, also, germany, itself, became, a, victim, of, similar, attacks, horses, bound, for, germany, were, infected, with, burkholderia, by, french, operatives, in, switzerland, during, world, war, ii, the, u, s, and, canada, secretly, investigated, the, use, of, rinderpest, a, highly, lethal, disease, of, cattle, as, a, bioweapon, in, the, 1980s, soviet, ministry, of, agriculture, had, successfully, developed, variants, of, foot, and, mouth, disease, and, rinderpest, against, cows, african, swine, fever, for, pigs, and, psittacosis, to, kill, the, chicken, these, agents, were, prepared, to, spray, them, down, from, tanks, attached, to, airplanes, over, hundreds, of, miles, the, secret, program, was, code, named, ecology, during, the, mau, mau, uprising, in, 1952, the, poisonous, latex, of, the, african, milk, bush, was, used, to, kill, cattle, in, 2010, at, the, meeting, of, the, states, parties, to, the, convention, on, the, prohibition, of, the, development, production, and, stockpiling, of, bacteriological, biological, and, toxin, weapons, and, their, destruction, in, geneva, the, sanitary, epidemiological, reconnaissance, was, suggested, as, well, tested, means, for, enhancing, the, monitoring, of, infections, and, parasitic, agents, for, the, practical, implementation, of, the, international, health, regulations, 2005, the, aim, was, to, prevent, and, minimize, the, consequences, of, natural, outbreaks, of, dangerous, infectious, diseases, as, well, as, the, threat, of, alleged, use, of, biological, weapons, against, btwc, states, parties, many, countries, require, their, active, duty, military, personnel, to, get, vaccinated, for, certain, diseases, that, may, potentially, be, used, as, a, bioweapon, such, as, anthrax, smallpox, and, various, other, vaccines, depending, on, the, area, of, operations, of, the, individual, military, units, and, commands, most, classical, and, modern, biological, weapons, pathogens, can, be, obtained, from, a, plant, or, an, animal, which, is, naturally, infected, in, the, largest, biological, weapons, accident, known, the, anthrax, outbreak, in, sverdlovsk, now, yekaterinburg, in, the, soviet, union, in, 1979, sheep, became, ill, with, anthrax, as, far, as, 200, kilometers, from, the, release, point, of, the, organism, from, a, military, facility, in, the, southeastern, portion, of, the, city, and, still, off, limits, to, visitors, today, see, sverdlovsk, anthrax, leak, thus, a, robust, surveillance, system, involving, human, clinicians, and, veterinarians, may, identify, a, bioweapons, attack, early, in, the, course, of, an, epidemic, permitting, the, prophylaxis, of, disease, in, the, vast, majority, of, people, and, or, animals, exposed, but, not, yet, ill, for, example, in, the, case, of, anthrax, it, is, likely, that, by, 24, 36, hours, after, an, attack, some, small, percentage, of, individuals, those, with, the, compromised, immune, system, or, who, had, received, a, large, dose, of, the, organism, due, to, proximity, to, the, release, point, will, become, ill, with, classical, symptoms, and, signs, including, a, virtually, unique, chest, x, ray, finding, often, recognized, by, public, health, officials, if, they, receive, timely, reports, the, incubation, period, for, humans, is, estimated, to, be, about, 11, 8, days, to, 12, 1, days, this, suggested, period, is, the, first, model, that, is, independently, consistent, with, data, from, the, largest, known, human, outbreak, these, projections, refine, previous, estimates, of, the, distribution, of, early, onset, cases, after, a, release, and, support, a, recommended, 60, day, course, of, prophylactic, antibiotic, treatment, for, individuals, exposed, to, low, doses, of, anthrax, by, making, these, data, available, to, local, public, health, officials, in, real, time, most, models, of, anthrax, epidemics, indicate, that, more, than, 80, of, an, exposed, population, can, receive, antibiotic, treatment, before, becoming, symptomatic, and, thus, avoid, the, moderately, high, mortality, of, the, disease, from, most, specific, to, least, specific, the, goal, of, biodefense, is, to, integrate, the, sustained, efforts, of, the, national, and, homeland, security, medical, public, health, intelligence, diplomatic, and, law, enforcement, communities, health, care, providers, and, public, health, officers, are, among, the, first, lines, of, defense, in, some, countries, private, local, and, provincial, state, capabilities, are, being, augmented, by, and, coordinated, with, federal, assets, to, provide, layered, defenses, against, biological, weapon, attacks, during, the, first, gulf, war, the, united, nations, activated, a, biological, and, chemical, response, team, task, force, scorpio, to, respond, to, any, potential, use, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, on, civilians, the, traditional, approach, toward, protecting, agriculture, food, and, water, focusing, on, the, natural, or, unintentional, introduction, of, a, disease, is, being, strengthened, by, focused, efforts, to, address, current, and, anticipated, future, biological, weapons, threats, that, may, be, deliberate, multiple, and, repetitive, the, growing, threat, of, biowarfare, agents, and, bioterrorism, has, led, to, the, development, of, specific, field, tools, that, perform, on, the, spot, analysis, and, identification, of, encountered, suspect, materials, one, such, technology, being, developed, by, researchers, from, the, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, llnl, employs, a, sandwich, immunoassay, in, which, fluorescent, dye, labeled, antibodies, aimed, at, specific, pathogens, are, attached, to, silver, and, gold, nanowires, in, the, netherlands, the, company, tno, has, designed, bioaerosol, single, particle, recognition, equipment, biosparq, this, system, would, be, implemented, into, the, national, response, plan, for, bioweapon, attacks, in, the, netherlands, researchers, at, ben, gurion, university, in, israel, are, developing, a, different, device, called, the, biopen, essentially, a, lab, in, a, pen, which, can, detect, known, biological, agents, in, under, 20, minutes, using, an, adaptation, of, the, elisa, a, similar, widely, employed, immunological, technique, that, in, this, case, incorporates, fiber, optics, bioweaponeers, writers, and, activists
