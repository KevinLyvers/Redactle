an, industrial, robot, is, a, robot, system, used, for, manufacturing, industrial, robots, are, automated, programmable, and, capable, of, movement, on, three, or, more, axes, typical, applications, of, robots, include, welding, painting, assembly, disassembly, pick, and, place, for, printed, circuit, boards, packaging, and, labeling, palletizing, product, inspection, and, testing, all, accomplished, with, high, endurance, speed, and, precision, they, can, assist, in, material, handling, in, the, year, 2022, an, estimated, 3, 903, 633, industrial, robots, were, in, operation, worldwide, according, to, international, federation, of, robotics, ifr, there, are, six, types, of, industrial, robots, articulated, robots, are, the, most, common, industrial, robots, they, look, like, a, human, arm, which, is, why, they, are, also, called, robotic, arm, or, manipulator, arm, their, articulations, with, several, degrees, of, freedom, allow, the, articulated, arms, a, wide, range, of, movements, an, autonomous, robot, is, a, robot, that, acts, without, recourse, to, human, control, the, first, autonomous, robots, environment, were, known, as, elmer, and, elsie, which, were, constructed, in, the, late, 1940s, by, w, grey, walter, they, were, the, first, robots, in, history, that, were, programmed, to, think, the, way, biological, brains, do, and, meant, to, have, free, will, elmer, and, elsie, were, often, labeled, as, tortoises, because, of, how, they, were, shaped, and, the, manner, in, which, they, moved, they, were, capable, of, phototaxis, which, is, the, movement, that, occurs, in, response, to, light, stimulus, cartesian, robots, also, called, rectilinear, gantry, robots, and, x, y, z, robots, have, three, prismatic, joints, for, the, movement, of, the, tool, and, three, rotary, joints, for, its, orientation, in, space, to, be, able, to, move, and, orient, the, effector, organ, in, all, directions, such, a, robot, needs, 6, axes, or, degrees, of, freedom, in, a, 2, dimensional, environment, three, axes, are, sufficient, two, for, displacement, and, one, for, orientation, the, cylindrical, coordinate, robots, are, characterized, by, their, rotary, joint, at, the, base, and, at, least, one, prismatic, joint, connecting, its, links, they, can, move, vertically, and, horizontally, by, sliding, the, compact, effector, design, allows, the, robot, to, reach, tight, work, spaces, without, any, loss, of, speed, spherical, coordinate, robots, only, have, rotary, joints, they, are, one, of, the, first, robots, to, have, been, used, in, industrial, applications, they, are, commonly, used, for, machine, tending, in, die, casting, plastic, injection, and, extrusion, and, for, welding, scara, is, an, acronym, for, selective, compliance, assembly, robot, arm, scara, robots, are, recognized, by, their, two, parallel, joints, which, provide, movement, in, the, x, y, plane, rotating, shafts, are, positioned, vertically, at, the, effector, scara, robots, are, used, for, jobs, that, require, precise, lateral, movements, they, are, ideal, for, assembly, applications, delta, robots, are, also, referred, to, as, parallel, link, robots, they, consist, of, parallel, links, connected, to, a, common, base, delta, robots, are, particularly, useful, for, direct, control, tasks, and, high, maneuvering, operations, such, as, quick, pick, and, place, tasks, delta, robots, take, advantage, of, four, bar, or, parallelogram, linkage, systems, furthermore, industrial, robots, can, have, a, serial, or, parallel, architecture, serial, architectures, a, k, a, serial, manipulators, are, very, common, industrial, robots, and, they, are, designed, as, a, series, of, links, connected, by, motor, actuated, joints, that, extend, from, a, base, to, an, end, effector, scara, stanford, manipulators, are, typical, examples, of, this, category, a, parallel, manipulator, is, designed, so, that, each, chain, is, usually, short, simple, and, can, thus, be, rigid, against, unwanted, movement, compared, to, a, serial, manipulator, errors, in, one, chain, s, positioning, are, averaged, in, conjunction, with, the, others, rather, than, being, cumulative, each, actuator, must, still, move, within, its, own, degree, of, freedom, as, for, a, serial, robot, however, in, the, parallel, robot, the, off, axis, flexibility, of, a, joint, is, also, constrained, by, the, effect, of, the, other, chains, it, is, this, closed, loop, stiffness, that, makes, the, overall, parallel, manipulator, stiff, relative, to, its, components, unlike, the, serial, chain, that, becomes, progressively, less, rigid, with, more, components, a, full, parallel, manipulator, can, move, an, object, with, up, to, 6, degrees, of, freedom, dof, determined, by, 3, translation, 3t, and, 3, rotation, 3r, coordinates, for, full, 3t3r, m, obility, however, when, a, manipulation, task, requires, less, than, 6, dof, the, use, of, lower, mobility, manipulators, with, fewer, than, 6, dof, may, bring, advantages, in, terms, of, simpler, architecture, easier, control, faster, motion, and, lower, cost, for, example, the, 3, dof, delta, robot, has, lower, 3t, mobility, and, has, proven, to, be, very, successful, for, rapid, pick, and, place, translational, positioning, applications, the, workspace, of, lower, mobility, manipulators, may, be, decomposed, into, motion, and, constraint, subspaces, for, example, 3, position, coordinates, constitute, the, motion, subspace, of, the, 3, dof, delta, robot, and, the, 3, orientation, coordinates, are, in, the, constraint, subspace, the, motion, subspace, of, lower, mobility, manipulators, may, be, further, decomposed, into, independent, desired, and, dependent, concomitant, subspaces, consisting, of, concomitant, or, parasitic, motion, which, is, undesired, motion, of, the, manipulator, the, debilitating, effects, of, concomitant, motion, should, be, mitigated, or, eliminated, in, the, successful, design, of, lower, mobility, manipulators, for, example, the, delta, robot, does, not, have, parasitic, motion, since, its, end, effector, does, not, rotate, robots, exhibit, varying, degrees, of, autonomy, some, robots, are, programmed, to, faithfully, carry, out, specific, actions, over, and, over, again, repetitive, actions, without, variation, and, with, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, these, actions, are, determined, by, programmed, routines, that, specify, the, direction, acceleration, velocity, deceleration, and, distance, of, a, series, of, coordinated, motions, other, robots, are, much, more, flexible, as, to, the, orientation, of, the, object, on, which, they, are, operating, or, even, the, task, that, has, to, be, performed, on, the, object, itself, which, the, robot, may, even, need, to, identify, for, example, for, more, precise, guidance, robots, often, contain, machine, vision, sub, systems, acting, as, their, visual, sensors, linked, to, powerful, computers, or, controllers, artificial, intelligence, is, becoming, an, increasingly, important, factor, in, the, modern, industrial, robot, the, earliest, known, industrial, robot, conforming, to, the, iso, definition, was, completed, by, bill, griffith, p, taylor, in, 1937, and, published, in, meccano, magazine, march, 1938, the, crane, like, device, was, built, almost, entirely, using, meccano, parts, and, powered, by, a, single, electric, motor, five, axes, of, movement, were, possible, including, grab, and, grab, rotation, automation, was, achieved, using, punched, paper, tape, to, energise, solenoids, which, would, facilitate, the, movement, of, the, crane, s, control, levers, the, robot, could, stack, wooden, blocks, in, pre, programmed, patterns, the, number, of, motor, revolutions, required, for, each, desired, movement, was, first, plotted, on, graph, paper, this, information, was, then, transferred, to, the, paper, tape, which, was, also, driven, by, the, robot, s, single, motor, chris, shute, built, a, complete, replica, of, the, robot, in, 1997, george, devol, applied, for, the, first, robotics, patents, in, 1954, granted, in, 1961, the, first, company, to, produce, a, robot, was, unimation, founded, by, devol, and, joseph, f, engelberger, in, 1956, unimation, robots, were, also, called, programmable, transfer, machines, since, their, main, use, at, first, was, to, transfer, objects, from, one, point, to, another, less, than, a, dozen, feet, or, so, apart, they, used, hydraulic, actuators, and, were, programmed, in, joint, coordinates, i, e, the, angles, of, the, various, joints, were, stored, during, a, teaching, phase, and, replayed, in, operation, they, were, accurate, to, within, 1, 10, 000, of, an, inch, note, although, accuracy, is, not, an, appropriate, measure, for, robots, usually, evaluated, in, terms, of, repeatability, see, later, unimation, later, licensed, their, technology, to, kawasaki, heavy, industries, and, gkn, manufacturing, unimates, in, japan, and, england, respectively, for, some, time, unimation, s, only, competitor, was, cincinnati, milacron, inc, of, ohio, this, changed, radically, in, the, late, 1970s, when, several, big, japanese, conglomerates, began, producing, similar, industrial, robots, in, 1969, victor, scheinman, at, stanford, university, invented, the, stanford, arm, an, all, electric, 6, axis, articulated, robot, designed, to, permit, an, arm, solution, this, allowed, it, accurately, to, follow, arbitrary, paths, in, space, and, widened, the, potential, use, of, the, robot, to, more, sophisticated, applications, such, as, assembly, and, welding, scheinman, then, designed, a, second, arm, for, the, mit, ai, lab, called, the, mit, arm, scheinman, after, receiving, a, fellowship, from, unimation, to, develop, his, designs, sold, those, designs, to, unimation, who, further, developed, them, with, support, from, general, motors, and, later, marketed, it, as, the, programmable, universal, machine, for, assembly, puma, industrial, robotics, took, off, quite, quickly, in, europe, with, both, abb, robotics, and, kuka, robotics, bringing, robots, to, the, market, in, 1973, abb, robotics, formerly, asea, introduced, irb, 6, among, the, world, s, first, commercially, available, all, electric, micro, processor, controlled, robot, the, first, two, irb, 6, robots, were, sold, to, magnusson, in, sweden, for, grinding, and, polishing, pipe, bends, and, were, installed, in, production, in, january, 1974, also, in, 1973, kuka, robotics, built, its, first, robot, known, as, famulus, also, one, of, the, first, articulated, robots, to, have, six, electromechanically, driven, axes, interest, in, robotics, increased, in, the, late, 1970s, and, many, us, companies, entered, the, field, including, large, firms, like, general, electric, and, general, motors, which, formed, joint, venture, fanuc, robotics, with, fanuc, ltd, of, japan, u, s, startup, companies, included, automatix, and, adept, technology, inc, at, the, height, of, the, robot, boom, in, 1984, unimation, was, acquired, by, westinghouse, electric, corporation, for, 107, million, u, s, dollars, westinghouse, sold, unimation, to, st, ubli, faverges, sca, of, france, in, 1988, which, is, still, making, articulated, robots, for, general, industrial, and, cleanroom, applications, and, even, bought, the, robotic, division, of, bosch, in, late, 2004, only, a, few, non, japanese, companies, ultimately, managed, to, survive, in, this, market, the, major, ones, being, adept, technology, st, ubli, the, swedish, swiss, company, abb, asea, brown, boveri, the, german, company, kuka, robotics, and, the, italian, company, comau, accuracy, and, repeatability, are, different, measures, repeatability, is, usually, the, most, important, criterion, for, a, robot, and, is, similar, to, the, concept, of, precision, in, measurement, see, accuracy, and, precision, iso, 9283, sets, out, a, method, whereby, both, accuracy, and, repeatability, can, be, measured, typically, a, robot, is, sent, to, a, taught, position, a, number, of, times, and, the, error, is, measured, at, each, return, to, the, position, after, visiting, 4, other, positions, repeatability, is, then, quantified, using, the, standard, deviation, of, those, samples, in, all, three, dimensions, a, typical, robot, can, of, course, make, a, positional, error, exceeding, that, and, that, could, be, a, problem, for, the, process, moreover, the, repeatability, is, different, in, different, parts, of, the, working, envelope, and, also, changes, with, speed, and, payload, iso, 9283, specifies, that, accuracy, and, repeatability, should, be, measured, at, maximum, speed, and, at, maximum, payload, but, this, results, in, pessimistic, values, whereas, the, robot, could, be, much, more, accurate, and, repeatable, at, light, loads, and, speeds, repeatability, in, an, industrial, process, is, also, subject, to, the, accuracy, of, the, end, effector, for, example, a, gripper, and, even, to, the, design, of, the, fingers, that, match, the, gripper, to, the, object, being, grasped, for, example, if, a, robot, picks, a, screw, by, its, head, the, screw, could, be, at, a, random, angle, a, subsequent, attempt, to, insert, the, screw, into, a, hole, could, easily, fail, these, and, similar, scenarios, can, be, improved, with, lead, ins, e, g, by, making, the, entrance, to, the, hole, tapered, the, setup, or, programming, of, motions, and, sequences, for, an, industrial, robot, is, typically, taught, by, linking, the, robot, controller, to, a, laptop, desktop, computer, or, internal, or, internet, network, a, robot, and, a, collection, of, machines, or, peripherals, is, referred, to, as, a, workcell, or, cell, a, typical, cell, might, contain, a, parts, feeder, a, molding, machine, and, a, robot, the, various, machines, are, integrated, and, controlled, by, a, single, computer, or, plc, how, the, robot, interacts, with, other, machines, in, the, cell, must, be, programmed, both, with, regard, to, their, positions, in, the, cell, and, synchronizing, with, them, software, the, computer, is, installed, with, corresponding, interface, software, the, use, of, a, computer, greatly, simplifies, the, programming, process, specialized, robot, software, is, run, either, in, the, robot, controller, or, in, the, computer, or, both, depending, on, the, system, design, there, are, two, basic, entities, that, need, to, be, taught, or, programmed, positional, data, and, procedure, for, example, in, a, task, to, move, a, screw, from, a, feeder, to, a, hole, the, positions, of, the, feeder, and, the, hole, must, first, be, taught, or, programmed, secondly, the, procedure, to, get, the, screw, from, the, feeder, to, the, hole, must, be, programmed, along, with, any, i, o, involved, for, example, a, signal, to, indicate, when, the, screw, is, in, the, feeder, ready, to, be, picked, up, the, purpose, of, the, robot, software, is, to, facilitate, both, these, programming, tasks, teaching, the, robot, positions, may, be, achieved, a, number, of, ways, positional, commands, the, robot, can, be, directed, to, the, required, position, using, a, gui, or, text, based, commands, in, which, the, required, x, y, z, position, may, be, specified, and, edited, teach, pendant, robot, positions, can, be, taught, via, a, teach, pendant, this, is, a, handheld, control, and, programming, unit, the, common, features, of, such, units, are, the, ability, to, manually, send, the, robot, to, a, desired, position, or, inch, or, jog, to, adjust, a, position, they, also, have, a, means, to, change, the, speed, since, a, low, speed, is, usually, required, for, careful, positioning, or, while, test, running, through, a, new, or, modified, routine, a, large, emergency, stop, button, is, usually, included, as, well, typically, once, the, robot, has, been, programmed, there, is, no, more, use, for, the, teach, pendant, all, teach, pendants, are, equipped, with, a, 3, position, deadman, switch, in, the, manual, mode, it, allows, the, robot, to, move, only, when, it, is, in, the, middle, position, partially, pressed, if, it, is, fully, pressed, in, or, completely, released, the, robot, stops, this, principle, of, operation, allows, natural, reflexes, to, be, used, to, increase, safety, lead, by, the, nose, this, is, a, technique, offered, by, many, robot, manufacturers, in, this, method, one, user, holds, the, robot, s, manipulator, while, another, person, enters, a, command, which, de, energizes, the, robot, causing, it, to, go, into, limp, the, user, then, moves, the, robot, by, hand, to, the, required, positions, and, or, along, a, required, path, while, the, software, logs, these, positions, into, memory, the, program, can, later, run, the, robot, to, these, positions, or, along, the, taught, path, this, technique, is, popular, for, tasks, such, as, paint, spraying, offline, programming, is, where, the, entire, cell, the, robot, and, all, the, machines, or, instruments, in, the, workspace, are, mapped, graphically, the, robot, can, then, be, moved, on, screen, and, the, process, simulated, a, robotics, simulator, is, used, to, create, embedded, applications, for, a, robot, without, depending, on, the, physical, operation, of, the, robot, arm, and, end, effector, the, advantages, of, robotics, simulation, is, that, it, saves, time, in, the, design, of, robotics, applications, it, can, also, increase, the, level, of, safety, associated, with, robotic, equipment, since, various, what, if, scenarios, can, be, tried, and, tested, before, the, system, is, activated, robot, simulation, software, provides, a, platform, to, teach, test, run, and, debug, programs, that, have, been, written, in, a, variety, of, programming, languages, robot, simulation, tools, allow, for, robotics, programs, to, be, conveniently, written, and, debugged, off, line, with, the, final, version, of, the, program, tested, on, an, actual, robot, the, ability, to, preview, the, behavior, of, a, robotic, system, in, a, virtual, world, allows, for, a, variety, of, mechanisms, devices, configurations, and, controllers, to, be, tried, and, tested, before, being, applied, to, a, real, world, system, robotics, simulators, have, the, ability, to, provide, real, time, computing, of, the, simulated, motion, of, an, industrial, robot, using, both, geometric, modeling, and, kinematics, modeling, manufacturing, independent, robot, programming, tools, are, a, relatively, new, but, flexible, way, to, program, robot, applications, using, a, graphical, user, interface, the, programming, is, done, via, drag, and, drop, of, predefined, template, building, blocks, they, often, feature, the, execution, of, simulations, to, evaluate, the, feasibility, and, offline, programming, in, combination, if, the, system, is, able, to, compile, and, upload, native, robot, code, to, the, robot, controller, the, user, no, longer, has, to, learn, each, manufacturer, s, proprietary, language, therefore, this, approach, can, be, an, important, step, to, standardize, programming, methods, others, in, addition, machine, operators, often, use, user, interface, devices, typically, touchscreen, units, which, serve, as, the, operator, control, panel, the, operator, can, switch, from, program, to, program, make, adjustments, within, a, program, and, also, operate, a, host, of, peripheral, devices, that, may, be, integrated, within, the, same, robotic, system, these, include, end, effectors, feeders, that, supply, components, to, the, robot, conveyor, belts, emergency, stop, controls, machine, vision, systems, safety, interlock, systems, barcode, printers, and, an, almost, infinite, array, of, other, industrial, devices, which, are, accessed, and, controlled, via, the, operator, control, panel, the, teach, pendant, or, pc, is, usually, disconnected, after, programming, and, the, robot, then, runs, on, the, program, that, has, been, installed, in, its, controller, however, a, computer, is, often, used, to, supervise, the, robot, and, any, peripherals, or, to, provide, additional, storage, for, access, to, numerous, complex, paths, and, routines, the, most, essential, robot, peripheral, is, the, end, effector, or, end, of, arm, tooling, eoat, common, examples, of, end, effectors, include, welding, devices, such, as, mig, welding, guns, spot, welders, etc, spray, guns, and, also, grinding, and, deburring, devices, such, as, pneumatic, disk, or, belt, grinders, burrs, etc, and, grippers, devices, that, can, grasp, an, object, usually, electromechanical, or, pneumatic, other, common, means, of, picking, up, objects, is, by, vacuum, or, magnets, end, effectors, are, frequently, highly, complex, made, to, match, the, handled, product, and, often, capable, of, picking, up, an, array, of, products, at, one, time, they, may, utilize, various, sensors, to, aid, the, robot, system, in, locating, handling, and, positioning, products, for, a, given, robot, the, only, parameters, necessary, to, completely, locate, the, end, effector, gripper, welding, torch, etc, of, the, robot, are, the, angles, of, each, of, the, joints, or, displacements, of, the, linear, axes, or, combinations, of, the, two, for, robot, formats, such, as, scara, however, there, are, many, different, ways, to, define, the, points, the, most, common, and, most, convenient, way, of, defining, a, point, is, to, specify, a, cartesian, coordinate, for, it, i, e, the, position, of, the, end, effector, in, mm, in, the, x, y, and, z, directions, relative, to, the, robot, s, origin, in, addition, depending, on, the, types, of, joints, a, particular, robot, may, have, the, orientation, of, the, end, effector, in, yaw, pitch, and, roll, and, the, location, of, the, tool, point, relative, to, the, robot, s, faceplate, must, also, be, specified, for, a, jointed, arm, these, coordinates, must, be, converted, to, joint, angles, by, the, robot, controller, and, such, conversions, are, known, as, cartesian, transformations, which, may, need, to, be, performed, iteratively, or, recursively, for, a, multiple, axis, robot, the, mathematics, of, the, relationship, between, joint, angles, and, actual, spatial, coordinates, is, called, kinematics, see, robot, control, positioning, by, cartesian, coordinates, may, be, done, by, entering, the, coordinates, into, the, system, or, by, using, a, teach, pendant, which, moves, the, robot, in, x, y, z, directions, it, is, much, easier, for, a, human, operator, to, visualize, motions, up, down, left, right, etc, than, to, move, each, joint, one, at, a, time, when, the, desired, position, is, reached, it, is, then, defined, in, some, way, particular, to, the, robot, software, in, use, e, g, p1, p5, below, most, articulated, robots, perform, by, storing, a, series, of, positions, in, memory, and, moving, to, them, at, various, times, in, their, programming, sequence, for, example, a, robot, which, is, moving, items, from, one, place, bin, a, to, another, bin, b, might, have, a, simple, pick, and, place, program, similar, to, the, following, define, points, p1, p5, define, program, for, examples, of, how, this, would, look, in, popular, robot, languages, see, industrial, robot, programming, the, american, national, standard, for, industrial, robots, and, robot, systems, safety, requirements, ansi, ria, r15, 06, 1999, defines, a, singularity, as, a, condition, caused, by, the, collinear, alignment, of, two, or, more, robot, axes, resulting, in, unpredictable, robot, motion, and, velocities, it, is, most, common, in, robot, arms, that, utilize, a, triple, roll, wrist, this, is, a, wrist, about, which, the, three, axes, of, the, wrist, controlling, yaw, pitch, and, roll, all, pass, through, a, common, point, an, example, of, a, wrist, singularity, is, when, the, path, through, which, the, robot, is, traveling, causes, the, first, and, third, axes, of, the, robot, s, wrist, i, e, robot, s, axes, 4, and, 6, to, line, up, the, second, wrist, axis, then, attempts, to, spin, 180, in, zero, time, to, maintain, the, orientation, of, the, end, effector, another, common, term, for, this, singularity, is, a, wrist, flip, the, result, of, a, singularity, can, be, quite, dramatic, and, can, have, adverse, effects, on, the, robot, arm, the, end, effector, and, the, process, some, industrial, robot, manufacturers, have, attempted, to, side, step, the, situation, by, slightly, altering, the, robot, s, path, to, prevent, this, condition, another, method, is, to, slow, the, robot, s, travel, speed, thus, reducing, the, speed, required, for, the, wrist, to, make, the, transition, the, ansi, ria, has, mandated, that, robot, manufacturers, shall, make, the, user, aware, of, singularities, if, they, occur, while, the, system, is, being, manually, manipulated, a, second, type, of, singularity, in, wrist, partitioned, vertically, articulated, six, axis, robots, occurs, when, the, wrist, center, lies, on, a, cylinder, that, is, centered, about, axis, 1, and, with, radius, equal, to, the, distance, between, axes, 1, and, 4, this, is, called, a, shoulder, singularity, some, robot, manufacturers, also, mention, alignment, singularities, where, axes, 1, and, 6, become, coincident, this, is, simply, a, sub, case, of, shoulder, singularities, when, the, robot, passes, close, to, a, shoulder, singularity, joint, 1, spins, very, fast, the, third, and, last, type, of, singularity, in, wrist, partitioned, vertically, articulated, six, axis, robots, occurs, when, the, wrist, s, center, lies, in, the, same, plane, as, axes, 2, and, 3, singularities, are, closely, related, to, the, phenomena, of, gimbal, lock, which, has, a, similar, root, cause, of, axes, becoming, lined, up, according, to, the, international, federation, of, robotics, ifr, study, world, robotics, 2023, there, were, about, 3, 903, 633, operational, industrial, robots, by, the, end, of, 2022, for, the, year, 2018, the, ifr, estimates, the, worldwide, sales, of, industrial, robots, with, us, 16, 5, billion, including, the, cost, of, software, peripherals, and, systems, engineering, the, annual, turnover, for, robot, systems, is, estimated, to, be, us, 48, 0, billion, in, 2018, china, is, the, largest, industrial, robot, market, with, 154, 032, units, sold, in, 2018, china, had, the, largest, operational, stock, of,
