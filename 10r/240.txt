dynamite, is, an, explosive, made, of, nitroglycerin, sorbents, such, as, powdered, shells, or, clay, and, stabilizers, it, was, invented, by, the, swedish, chemist, and, engineer, alfred, nobel, in, geesthacht, northern, germany, and, was, patented, in, 1867, it, rapidly, gained, wide, scale, use, as, a, more, robust, alternative, to, the, traditional, black, powder, explosives, it, allows, the, use, of, nitroglycerine, s, favorable, explosive, properties, while, greatly, reducing, its, risk, of, accidental, detonation, dynamite, was, invented, by, swedish, chemist, alfred, nobel, in, 1866, and, was, the, first, safely, manageable, explosive, stronger, than, black, powder, alfred, nobel, s, father, immanuel, nobel, was, an, industrialist, engineer, and, inventor, he, built, bridges, and, buildings, in, stockholm, and, founded, sweden, s, first, rubber, factory, his, construction, work, inspired, him, to, research, new, methods, of, blasting, rock, that, were, more, effective, than, black, powder, after, some, bad, business, deals, in, sweden, in, 1838, immanuel, moved, his, family, to, saint, petersburg, where, alfred, and, his, brothers, were, educated, privately, under, swedish, and, russian, tutors, at, the, age, of, 17, alfred, nobel, was, sent, abroad, for, two, years, in, the, united, states, he, met, swedish, engineer, john, ericsson, and, in, france, studied, under, famed, chemist, th, ophile, jules, pelouze, and, his, pupil, ascanio, sobrero, who, had, first, synthesized, nitroglycerin, in, 1847, pelouze, cautioned, nobel, against, using, nitroglycerine, as, a, commercial, explosive, because, of, its, great, sensitivity, to, shock, in, 1857, nobel, filed, the, first, of, several, hundred, patents, mostly, concerning, air, pressure, gas, and, fluid, gauges, but, remained, fascinated, with, nitroglycerin, s, potential, as, an, explosive, nobel, along, with, his, father, and, brother, emil, experimented, with, various, combinations, of, nitroglycerin, and, black, powder, nobel, came, up, with, a, way, to, safely, detonate, nitroglycerin, by, inventing, the, detonator, or, blasting, cap, that, allowed, a, controlled, explosion, set, off, from, a, distance, using, a, fuse, in, 1863, nobel, performed, his, first, successful, detonation, of, pure, nitroglycerin, using, a, blasting, cap, made, of, a, copper, percussion, cap, and, mercury, fulminate, in, 1864, alfred, nobel, filed, patents, for, both, the, blasting, cap, and, his, method, of, synthesizing, nitroglycerin, using, sulfuric, acid, nitric, acid, and, glycerin, on, 3, september, 1864, while, experimenting, with, nitroglycerin, emil, and, several, others, were, killed, in, an, explosion, at, the, factory, at, immanuel, nobel, s, estate, at, heleneborg, after, this, alfred, founded, the, company, nitroglycerin, aktiebolaget, in, vinterviken, to, continue, work, in, a, more, isolated, area, and, the, following, year, moved, to, germany, where, he, founded, another, company, dynamit, nobel, despite, the, invention, of, the, blasting, cap, the, instability, of, nitroglycerin, rendered, it, useless, as, a, commercial, explosive, to, solve, this, problem, nobel, sought, to, combine, it, with, another, substance, that, would, make, it, safe, for, transport, and, handling, but, would, not, reduce, its, effectiveness, as, an, explosive, he, tried, combinations, of, cement, coal, and, sawdust, but, was, unsuccessful, finally, he, tried, diatomaceous, earth, which, is, fossilized, algae, that, he, brought, from, the, elbe, river, near, his, factory, in, hamburg, which, successfully, stabilized, the, nitroglycerin, into, a, portable, explosive, nobel, obtained, patents, for, his, inventions, in, england, on, 7, may, 1867, and, in, sweden, on, 19, october, 1867, after, its, introduction, dynamite, rapidly, gained, wide, scale, use, as, a, safe, alternative, to, black, powder, and, nitroglycerin, nobel, tightly, controlled, the, patents, and, unlicensed, duplicating, companies, were, quickly, shut, down, a, few, american, businessmen, got, around, the, patent, by, using, absorbents, other, than, diatomaceous, earth, such, as, resin, nobel, originally, sold, dynamite, as, nobel, s, blasting, powder, and, later, changed, the, name, to, dynamite, from, the, ancient, greek, word, d, namis, meaning, power, dynamite, is, usually, sold, in, the, form, of, cardboard, cylinders, about, 200, mm, 8, in, long, and, about, 32, mm, 1, 1, 4, in, in, diameter, with, a, mass, of, about, 190, grams, 1, 2, troy, pound, a, stick, of, dynamite, thus, produced, contains, roughly, 1, mj, megajoule, of, energy, other, sizes, also, exist, rated, by, either, portion, quarter, stick, or, half, stick, or, by, weight, dynamite, is, usually, rated, by, weight, strength, the, amount, of, nitroglycerin, it, contains, usually, from, 20, to, 60, for, example, 40, dynamite, is, composed, of, 40, nitroglycerin, and, 60, dope, the, absorbent, storage, medium, mixed, with, the, stabilizer, and, any, additives, the, maximum, shelf, life, of, nitroglycerin, based, dynamite, is, recommended, as, one, year, from, the, date, of, manufacture, under, good, storage, conditions, over, time, regardless, of, the, sorbent, used, sticks, of, dynamite, will, weep, or, sweat, nitroglycerin, which, can, then, pool, in, the, bottom, of, the, box, or, storage, area, for, that, reason, explosive, manuals, recommend, the, regular, up, ending, of, boxes, of, dynamite, in, storage, crystals, will, form, on, the, outside, of, the, sticks, causing, them, to, be, even, more, sensitive, to, shock, friction, and, temperature, therefore, while, the, risk, of, an, explosion, without, the, use, of, a, blasting, cap, is, minimal, for, fresh, dynamite, old, dynamite, is, dangerous, modern, packaging, helps, eliminate, this, by, placing, the, dynamite, into, sealed, plastic, bags, and, using, wax, coated, cardboard, dynamite, is, moderately, sensitive, to, shock, shock, resistance, tests, are, usually, carried, out, with, a, drop, hammer, about, 100, mg, of, explosive, is, placed, on, an, anvil, upon, which, a, weight, of, between, 0, 5, and, 10, kg, 1, and, 22, lb, is, dropped, from, different, heights, until, detonation, is, achieved, with, a, hammer, of, 2, kg, mercury, fulminate, detonates, with, a, drop, distance, of, 1, to, 2, cm, nitroglycerin, with, 4, to, 5, cm, dynamite, with, 15, to, 30, cm, and, ammoniacal, explosives, with, 40, to, 50, cm, for, several, decades, beginning, in, the, 1940s, the, largest, producer, of, dynamite, in, the, world, was, the, union, of, south, africa, there, the, de, beers, company, established, a, factory, in, 1902, at, somerset, west, the, explosives, factory, was, later, operated, by, aeci, african, explosives, and, chemical, industries, the, demand, for, the, product, came, mainly, from, the, country, s, vast, gold, mines, centered, on, the, witwatersrand, the, factory, at, somerset, west, was, in, operation, in, 1903, and, by, 1907, it, was, already, producing, 340, 000, cases, 23, kilograms, 50, lb, each, annually, a, rival, factory, at, modderfontein, was, producing, another, 200, 000, cases, per, year, there, were, two, large, explosions, at, the, somerset, west, plant, during, the, 1960s, some, workers, died, but, the, loss, of, life, was, limited, by, the, modular, design, of, the, factory, and, its, earth, works, and, the, planting, of, trees, that, directed, the, blasts, upward, there, were, several, other, explosions, at, the, modderfontein, factory, after, 1985, pressure, from, trade, unions, forced, aeci, to, phase, out, the, production, of, dynamite, the, factory, then, went, on, to, produce, ammonium, nitrate, emulsion, based, explosives, that, are, safer, to, manufacture, and, handle, dynamite, was, first, manufactured, in, the, us, by, the, giant, powder, company, of, san, francisco, california, whose, founder, had, obtained, the, exclusive, rights, from, nobel, in, 1867, giant, was, eventually, acquired, by, dupont, which, produced, dynamite, under, the, giant, name, until, giant, was, dissolved, by, dupont, in, 1905, thereafter, dupont, produced, dynamite, under, its, own, name, until, 1911, 12, when, its, explosives, monopoly, was, broken, up, by, the, u, s, circuit, court, in, the, powder, case, two, new, companies, were, formed, upon, the, breakup, the, hercules, powder, company, and, the, atlas, powder, company, which, took, up, the, manufacture, of, dynamite, in, different, formulations, currently, only, dyno, nobel, manufactures, dynamite, in, the, us, the, only, facility, producing, it, is, located, in, carthage, missouri, but, the, material, is, purchased, from, dyno, nobel, by, other, manufacturers, who, put, their, labels, on, the, dynamite, and, boxes, other, explosives, are, often, referred, to, or, confused, with, dynamite, trinitrotoluene, tnt, is, often, assumed, to, be, the, same, as, or, confused, for, dynamite, largely, because, of, the, ubiquity, of, both, explosives, during, the, 20th, century, this, incorrect, connection, between, tnt, and, dynamite, was, enhanced, by, cartoons, such, as, bugs, bunny, where, animators, labeled, any, kind, of, bomb, ranging, from, sticks, of, dynamite, to, kegs, of, black, powder, as, tnt, because, the, acronym, was, shorter, and, more, memorable, and, did, not, require, literacy, to, recognize, that, tnt, meant, bomb, aside, from, both, being, high, explosives, tnt, and, dynamite, have, little, in, common, tnt, is, a, second, generation, castable, explosive, adopted, by, the, military, while, dynamite, in, contrast, has, never, been, popular, in, warfare, because, it, degenerates, quickly, under, severe, conditions, and, can, be, detonated, by, either, fire, or, a, wayward, bullet, the, german, armed, forces, adopted, tnt, as, a, filling, for, artillery, shells, in, 1902, some, 40, years, after, the, invention, of, dynamite, which, is, a, first, generation, phlegmatized, explosive, primarily, intended, for, civilian, earthmoving, tnt, has, never, been, popular, or, widespread, in, civilian, earthmoving, as, it, is, considerably, more, expensive, and, less, powerful, by, weight, than, dynamite, as, well, as, being, slower, to, mix, and, pack, into, boreholes, tnt, s, primary, asset, is, its, remarkable, insensitivity, and, stability, it, is, waterproof, and, incapable, of, detonating, without, the, extreme, shock, and, heat, provided, by, a, blasting, cap, or, a, sympathetic, detonation, this, stability, also, allows, it, to, be, melted, at, 81, c, 178, f, poured, into, high, explosive, shells, and, allowed, to, re, solidify, with, no, extra, danger, or, change, in, the, tnt, s, characteristics, accordingly, more, than, 90, of, the, tnt, produced, in, america, was, always, for, the, military, market, with, most, tnt, used, for, filling, shells, hand, grenades, and, aerial, bombs, and, the, remainder, being, packaged, in, brown, bricks, not, red, cylinders, for, use, as, demolition, charges, by, combat, engineers, in, the, united, states, in, 1885, the, chemist, russell, s, penniman, invented, ammonium, dynamite, a, form, of, explosive, that, used, ammonium, nitrate, as, a, substitute, for, the, more, costly, nitroglycerin, ammonium, nitrate, has, only, 85, of, the, chemical, energy, of, nitroglycerin, it, is, rated, by, either, weight, strength, the, amount, of, ammonium, nitrate, in, the, medium, or, cartridge, strength, the, potential, explosive, strength, generated, by, an, amount, of, explosive, of, a, certain, density, and, grain, size, used, in, comparison, to, the, explosive, strength, generated, by, an, equivalent, density, and, grain, size, of, a, standard, explosive, for, example, high, explosive, 65, extra, dynamite, has, a, weight, strength, of, 65, ammonium, nitrate, and, 35, dope, the, absorbent, medium, mixed, with, the, stabilizers, and, additives, its, cartridge, strength, would, be, its, weight, in, pounds, times, its, strength, in, relation, to, an, equal, amount, of, anfo, the, civilian, baseline, standard, or, tnt, the, military, baseline, standard, for, example, 65, ammonium, dynamite, with, a, 20, cartridge, strength, would, mean, the, stick, was, equal, to, an, equivalent, weight, strength, of, 20, anfo, military, dynamite, or, m1, dynamite, is, a, dynamite, substitute, made, with, more, stable, ingredients, than, nitroglycerin, it, contains, 75, rdx, 15, tnt, and, 10, percent, desensitizers, and, plasticizers, it, has, only, 60, percent, equivalent, strength, as, commercial, dynamite, but, is, much, safer, to, store, and, handle, various, countries, around, the, world, have, enacted, explosives, laws, and, require, licenses, to, manufacture, distribute, store, use, and, possess, explosives, or, ingredients
