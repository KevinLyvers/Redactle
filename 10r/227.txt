a, water, supply, network, or, water, supply, system, is, a, system, of, engineered, hydrologic, and, hydraulic, components, that, provide, water, supply, a, water, supply, system, typically, includes, the, following, water, supply, networks, are, often, run, by, public, utilities, of, the, water, industry, raw, water, untreated, is, from, a, surface, water, source, such, as, an, intake, on, a, lake, or, a, river, or, from, a, groundwater, source, such, as, a, water, well, drawing, from, an, underground, aquifer, within, the, watershed, that, provides, the, water, resource, the, raw, water, is, transferred, to, the, water, purification, facilities, using, uncovered, aqueducts, covered, tunnels, or, underground, water, pipes, virtually, all, large, systems, must, treat, the, water, a, fact, that, is, tightly, regulated, by, global, state, and, federal, agencies, such, as, the, world, health, organization, who, or, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, water, treatment, must, occur, before, the, product, reaches, the, consumer, and, afterwards, when, it, is, discharged, again, water, purification, usually, occurs, close, to, the, final, delivery, points, to, reduce, pumping, costs, and, the, chances, of, the, water, becoming, contaminated, after, treatment, traditional, surface, water, treatment, plants, generally, consists, of, three, steps, clarification, filtration, and, disinfection, clarification, refers, to, the, separation, of, particles, dirt, organic, matter, etc, from, the, water, stream, chemical, addition, i, e, alum, ferric, chloride, destabilizes, the, particle, charges, and, prepares, them, for, clarification, either, by, settling, or, floating, out, of, the, water, stream, sand, anthracite, or, activated, carbon, filters, refine, the, water, stream, removing, smaller, particulate, matter, while, other, methods, of, disinfection, exist, the, preferred, method, is, via, chlorine, addition, chlorine, effectively, kills, bacteria, and, most, viruses, and, maintains, a, residual, to, protect, the, water, supply, through, the, supply, network, the, product, delivered, to, the, point, of, consumption, is, called, potable, water, if, it, meets, the, water, quality, standards, required, for, human, consumption, the, water, in, the, supply, network, is, maintained, at, positive, pressure, to, ensure, that, water, reaches, all, parts, of, the, network, that, a, sufficient, flow, is, available, at, every, take, off, point, and, to, ensure, that, untreated, water, in, the, ground, cannot, enter, the, network, the, water, is, typically, pressurised, by, pumping, the, water, into, storage, tanks, constructed, at, the, highest, local, point, in, the, network, one, network, may, have, several, such, service, reservoirs, in, small, domestic, systems, the, water, may, be, pressurised, by, a, pressure, vessel, or, even, by, an, underground, cistern, the, latter, however, does, need, additional, pressurizing, this, eliminates, the, need, of, a, water, tower, or, any, other, heightened, water, reserve, to, supply, the, water, pressure, these, systems, are, usually, owned, and, maintained, by, local, governments, such, as, cities, or, other, public, entities, but, are, occasionally, operated, by, a, commercial, enterprise, see, water, privatization, water, supply, networks, are, part, of, the, master, planning, of, communities, counties, and, municipalities, their, planning, and, design, requires, the, expertise, of, city, planners, and, civil, engineers, who, must, consider, many, factors, such, as, location, current, demand, future, growth, leakage, pressure, pipe, size, pressure, loss, fire, fighting, flows, etc, using, pipe, network, analysis, and, other, tools, as, water, passes, through, the, distribution, system, the, water, quality, can, degrade, by, chemical, reactions, and, biological, processes, corrosion, of, metal, pipe, materials, in, the, distribution, system, can, cause, the, release, of, metals, into, the, water, with, undesirable, aesthetic, and, health, effects, release, of, iron, from, unlined, iron, pipes, can, result, in, customer, reports, of, red, water, at, the, tap, release, of, copper, from, copper, pipes, can, result, in, customer, reports, of, blue, water, and, or, a, metallic, taste, release, of, lead, can, occur, from, the, solder, used, to, join, copper, pipe, together, or, from, brass, fixtures, copper, and, lead, levels, at, the, consumer, s, tap, are, regulated, to, protect, consumer, health, utilities, will, often, adjust, the, chemistry, of, the, water, before, distribution, to, minimize, its, corrosiveness, the, simplest, adjustment, involves, control, of, ph, and, alkalinity, to, produce, a, water, that, tends, to, passivate, corrosion, by, depositing, a, layer, of, calcium, carbonate, corrosion, inhibitors, are, often, added, to, reduce, release, of, metals, into, the, water, common, corrosion, inhibitors, added, to, the, water, are, phosphates, and, silicates, maintenance, of, a, biologically, safe, drinking, water, is, another, goal, in, water, distribution, typically, a, chlorine, based, disinfectant, such, as, sodium, hypochlorite, or, monochloramine, is, added, to, the, water, as, it, leaves, the, treatment, plant, booster, stations, can, be, placed, within, the, distribution, system, to, ensure, that, all, areas, of, the, distribution, system, have, adequate, sustained, levels, of, disinfection, like, electric, power, lines, roads, and, microwave, radio, networks, water, systems, may, have, a, loop, or, branch, network, topology, or, a, combination, of, both, the, piping, networks, are, circular, or, rectangular, if, any, one, section, of, water, distribution, main, fails, or, needs, repair, that, section, can, be, isolated, without, disrupting, all, users, on, the, network, most, systems, are, divided, into, zones, factors, determining, the, extent, or, size, of, a, zone, can, include, hydraulics, telemetry, systems, history, and, population, density, sometimes, systems, are, designed, for, a, specific, area, then, are, modified, to, accommodate, development, terrain, affects, hydraulics, and, some, forms, of, telemetry, while, each, zone, may, operate, as, a, stand, alone, system, there, is, usually, some, arrangement, to, interconnect, zones, in, order, to, manage, equipment, failures, or, system, failures, water, supply, networks, usually, represent, the, majority, of, assets, of, a, water, utility, systematic, documentation, of, maintenance, works, using, a, computerized, maintenance, management, system, cmms, is, a, key, to, a, successful, operation, of, a, water, utility, a, sustainable, urban, water, supply, network, covers, all, the, activities, related, to, provision, of, potable, water, sustainable, development, is, of, increasing, importance, for, the, water, supply, to, urban, areas, incorporating, innovative, water, technologies, into, water, supply, systems, improves, water, supply, from, sustainable, perspectives, the, development, of, innovative, water, technologies, provides, flexibility, to, the, water, supply, system, generating, a, fundamental, and, effective, means, of, sustainability, based, on, an, integrated, real, options, approach, water, is, an, essential, natural, resource, for, human, existence, it, is, needed, in, every, industrial, and, natural, process, for, example, it, is, used, for, oil, refining, for, liquid, liquid, extraction, in, hydro, metallurgical, processes, for, cooling, for, scrubbing, in, the, iron, and, the, steel, industry, and, for, several, operations, in, food, processing, facilities, it, is, necessary, to, adopt, a, new, approach, to, design, urban, water, supply, networks, water, shortages, are, expected, in, the, forthcoming, decades, and, environmental, regulations, for, water, utilization, and, waste, water, disposal, are, increasingly, stringent, to, achieve, a, sustainable, water, supply, network, new, sources, of, water, are, needed, to, be, developed, and, to, reduce, environmental, pollution, the, price, of, water, is, increasing, so, less, water, must, be, wasted, and, actions, must, be, taken, to, prevent, pipeline, leakage, shutting, down, the, supply, service, to, fix, leaks, is, less, and, less, tolerated, by, consumers, a, sustainable, water, supply, network, must, monitor, the, freshwater, consumption, rate, and, the, waste, water, generation, rate, many, of, the, urban, water, supply, networks, in, developing, countries, face, problems, related, to, population, increase, water, scarcity, and, environmental, pollution, in, 1900, just, 13, of, the, global, population, lived, in, cities, by, 2005, 49, of, the, global, population, lived, in, urban, areas, in, 2030, it, is, predicted, that, this, statistic, will, rise, to, 60, attempts, to, expand, water, supply, by, governments, are, costly, and, often, not, sufficient, the, building, of, new, illegal, settlements, makes, it, hard, to, map, and, make, connections, to, the, water, supply, and, leads, to, inadequate, water, management, in, 2002, there, were, 158, million, people, with, inadequate, water, supply, an, increasing, number, of, people, live, in, slums, in, inadequate, sanitary, conditions, and, are, therefore, at, risk, of, disease, potable, water, is, not, well, distributed, in, the, world, 1, 8, million, deaths, are, attributed, to, unsafe, water, supplies, every, year, according, to, the, who, many, people, do, not, have, any, access, or, do, not, have, access, to, quality, and, quantity, of, potable, water, though, water, itself, is, abundant, poor, people, in, developing, countries, can, be, close, to, major, rivers, or, be, in, high, rainfall, areas, yet, not, have, access, to, potable, water, at, all, there, are, also, people, living, where, lack, of, water, creates, millions, of, deaths, every, year, where, the, water, supply, system, cannot, reach, the, slums, people, manage, to, use, hand, pumps, to, reach, the, pit, wells, rivers, canals, swamps, and, any, other, source, of, water, in, most, cases, the, water, quality, is, unfit, for, human, consumption, the, principal, cause, of, water, scarcity, is, the, growth, in, demand, water, is, taken, from, remote, areas, to, satisfy, the, needs, of, urban, areas, another, reason, for, water, scarcity, is, climate, change, precipitation, patterns, have, changed, rivers, have, decreased, their, flow, lakes, are, drying, up, and, aquifers, are, being, emptied, in, developing, countries, many, governments, are, corrupt, and, poor, and, they, respond, to, these, problems, with, frequently, changing, policies, and, non, clear, agreements, water, demand, exceeds, supply, and, household, and, industrial, water, supplies, are, prioritised, over, other, uses, which, leads, to, water, stress, potable, water, has, a, price, in, the, market, water, often, becomes, a, business, for, private, companies, which, earn, a, profit, by, putting, a, higher, price, on, water, which, imposes, a, barrier, for, lower, income, people, the, millennium, development, goals, propose, the, changes, required, goal, 6, of, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goals, is, to, ensure, availability, and, sustainable, management, of, water, and, sanitation, for, all, this, is, in, recognition, of, the, human, right, to, water, and, sanitation, which, was, formally, acknowledged, at, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 2010, that, clean, drinking, water, and, sanitation, are, essential, to, the, recognition, of, all, human, rights, sustainable, water, supply, includes, ensuring, availability, accessibility, affordability, and, quality, of, water, for, all, individuals, in, advanced, economies, the, problems, are, about, optimising, existing, supply, networks, these, economies, have, usually, had, continuing, evolution, which, allowed, them, to, construct, infrastructure, to, supply, water, to, people, the, european, union, has, developed, a, set, of, rules, and, policies, to, overcome, expected, future, problems, there, are, many, international, documents, with, interesting, but, not, very, specific, ideas, and, therefore, they, are, not, put, into, practice, recommendations, have, been, made, by, the, united, nations, such, as, the, dublin, statement, on, water, and, sustainable, development, the, yield, of, a, system, can, be, measured, by, either, its, value, or, its, net, benefit, for, a, water, supply, system, the, true, value, or, the, net, benefit, is, a, reliable, water, supply, service, having, adequate, quantity, and, good, quality, of, the, product, for, example, if, the, existing, water, supply, of, a, city, needs, to, be, extended, to, supply, a, new, municipality, the, impact, of, the, new, branch, of, the, system, must, be, designed, to, supply, the, new, needs, while, maintaining, supply, to, the, old, system, the, design, of, a, system, is, governed, by, multiple, criteria, one, being, cost, if, the, benefit, is, fixed, the, least, cost, design, results, in, maximum, benefit, however, the, least, cost, approach, normally, results, in, a, minimum, capacity, for, a, water, supply, network, a, minimum, cost, model, usually, searches, for, the, least, cost, solution, in, pipe, sizes, while, satisfying, the, hydraulic, constraints, such, as, required, output, pressures, maximum, pipe, flow, rate, and, pipe, flow, velocities, the, cost, is, a, function, of, pipe, diameters, therefore, the, optimization, problem, consists, of, finding, a, minimum, cost, solution, by, optimising, pipe, sizes, to, provide, the, minimum, acceptable, capacity, however, according, to, the, authors, of, the, paper, entitled, method, for, optimizing, design, and, rehabilitation, of, water, distribution, systems, the, least, capacity, is, not, a, desirable, solution, to, a, sustainable, water, supply, network, in, a, long, term, due, to, the, uncertainty, of, the, future, demand, it, is, preferable, to, provide, extra, pipe, capacity, to, cope, with, unexpected, demand, growth, and, with, water, outages, the, problem, changes, from, a, single, objective, optimization, problem, minimizing, cost, to, a, multi, objective, optimization, problem, minimizing, cost, and, maximizing, flow, capacity, to, solve, a, multi, objective, optimization, problem, it, is, necessary, to, convert, the, problem, into, a, single, objective, optimization, problem, by, using, adjustments, such, as, a, weighted, sum, of, objectives, or, an, constraint, method, the, weighted, sum, approach, gives, a, certain, weight, to, the, different, objectives, and, then, factors, in, all, these, weights, to, form, a, single, objective, function, that, can, be, solved, by, single, factor, optimization, this, method, is, not, entirely, satisfactory, because, the, weights, cannot, be, correctly, chosen, so, this, approach, cannot, find, the, optimal, solution, for, all, the, original, objectives, the, second, approach, the, constraint, method, chooses, one, of, the, objective, functions, as, the, single, objective, and, the, other, objective, functions, are, treated, as, constraints, with, a, limited, value, however, the, optimal, solution, depends, on, the, pre, defined, constraint, limits, the, multiple, objective, optimization, problems, involve, computing, the, tradeoff, between, the, costs, and, benefits, resulting, in, a, set, of, solutions, that, can, be, used, for, sensitivity, analysis, and, tested, in, different, scenarios, but, there, is, no, single, optimal, solution, that, will, satisfy, the, global, optimality, of, both, objectives, as, both, objectives, are, to, some, extent, contradictory, it, is, not, possible, to, improve, one, objective, without, sacrificing, the, other, it, is, necessary, in, some, cases, use, a, different, approach, e, g, pareto, analysis, and, choose, the, best, combination, returning, to, the, cost, objective, function, it, cannot, violate, any, of, the, operational, constraints, generally, this, cost, is, dominated, by, the, energy, cost, for, pumping, the, operational, constraints, include, the, standards, of, customer, service, such, as, the, minimum, delivered, pressure, in, addition, to, the, physical, constraints, such, as, the, maximum, and, the, minimum, water, levels, in, storage, tanks, to, prevent, overtopping, and, emptying, respectively, in, order, to, optimize, the, operational, performance, of, the, water, supply, network, at, the, same, time, as, minimizing, the, energy, costs, it, is, necessary, to, predict, the, consequences, of, different, pump, and, valve, settings, on, the, behavior, of, the, network, apart, from, linear, and, non, linear, programming, there, are, other, methods, and, approaches, to, design, to, manage, and, operate, a, water, supply, network, to, achieve, sustainability, for, instance, the, adoption, of, appropriate, technology, coupled, with, effective, strategies, for, operation, and, maintenance, these, strategies, must, include, effective, management, models, technical, support, to, the, householders, and, industries, sustainable, financing, mechanisms, and, development, of, reliable, supply, chains, all, these, measures, must, ensure, the, following, system, working, lifespan, maintenance, cycle, continuity, of, functioning, down, time, for, repairs, water, yield, and, water, quality, in, an, unsustainable, system, there, is, insufficient, maintenance, of, the, water, networks, especially, in, the, major, pipe, lines, in, urban, areas, the, system, deteriorates, and, then, needs, rehabilitation, or, renewal, householders, and, sewage, treatment, plants, can, both, make, the, water, supply, networks, more, efficient, and, sustainable, major, improvements, in, eco, efficiency, are, gained, through, systematic, separation, of, rainfall, and, wastewater, membrane, technology, can, be, used, for, recycling, wastewater, the, municipal, government, can, develop, a, municipal, water, reuse, system, which, is, a, current, approach, to, manage, the, rainwater, it, applies, a, water, reuse, scheme, for, treated, wastewater, on, a, municipal, scale, to, provide, non, potable, water, for, industry, household, and, municipal, uses, this, technology, consists, in, separating, the, urine, fraction, of, sanitary, wastewater, and, collecting, it, for, recycling, its, nutrients, the, feces, and, graywater, fraction, is, collected, together, with, organic, wastes, from, the, households, using, a, gravity, sewer, system, continuously, flushed, with, non, potable, water, the, water, is, treated, anaerobically, and, the, biogas, is, used, for, energy, production, one, effective, way, to, achieve, sustainable, water, management, is, to, shift, emphasis, towards, decentralized, water, projects, such, as, drip, irrigation, diffusion, in, india, this, project, covers, large, spatial, areas, while, relying, on, individual, technological, adoption, decisions, offering, scalable, solutions, that, can, mitigate, water, scarcity, and, enhance, agricultural, productivity, another, method, that, can, be, utilized, is, through, the, promoting, of, community, engagement, and, resistance, against, unsustainable, water, infrastructure, projects, grassroots, movements, as, observed, in, anti, dam, protests, in, various, countries, play, a, crucial, role, in, challenging, dominant, development, narratives, and, advocating, for, more, socially, and, ecologically, just, water, management, practices, municipalities, and, other, forms, of, local, governments, should, also, invest, in, innovative, technologies, such, as, membrane, technology, for, wastewater, recycling, and, develop, policy, frameworks, that, incentivize, eco, efficient, practices, municipal, water, reuse, systems, as, demonstrated, in, implementation, offer, promising, avenues, for, integrating, wastewater, treatment, and, resource, recovery, into, urban, water, networks, the, sustainable, water, supply, system, is, an, integrated, system, including, water, intake, water, utilization, wastewater, discharge, and, treatment, and, water, environmental, protection, it, requires, reducing, freshwater, and, groundwater, usage, in, all, sectors, of, consumption, developing, sustainable, water, supply, systems, is, a, growing, trend, because, it, serves, people, s, long, term, interests, there, are, several, ways, to, reuse, and, recycle, the, water, in, order, to, achieve, long, term, sustainability, such, as, other, possible, approaches, to, scoping, models, for, water, supply, applicable, to, any, urban, area, include, the, following, the, dublin, statement, on, water, and, sustainable, development, is, a, good, example, of, the, new, trend, to, overcome, water, supply, problems, this, statement, suggested, by, advanced, economies, has, come, up, with, some, principles, that, are, of, great, significance, to, urban, water, supply, these, are, from, these, statements, developed, in, 1992, several, policies, have, been, created, to, give, importance, to, water, and, to, move, urban, water, system, management, towards, sustainable, development, the, water, framework, directive, by, the, european, commission, is, a, good, example, of, what, has, been, created, there, out, of, former, policies, there, is, great, need, for, a, more, sustainable, water, supply, systems, to, achieve, sustainability, several, factors, must, be, tackled, at, the, same, time, climate, change, rising, energy, cost, and, rising, populations, all, of, these, factors, provoke, change, and, put, pressure, on, management, of, available, water, resources, an, obstacle, to, transforming, conventional, water, supply, systems, is, the, amount, of, time, needed, to, achieve, the, transformation, more, specifically, transformation, must, be, implemented, by, municipal, legislation, bodies, which, always, need, short, term, solutions, too, another, obstacle, to, achieving, sustainability, in, water, supply, systems, is, the, insufficient, practical, experience, with, the, technologies, required, and, the, missing, know, how, about, the, organization, and, the, transition, process, urban, water, infrastructure, faces, several, challenges, that, undermine, its, sustainability, and, resilience, one, critical, issue, highlighted, in, recent, research, is, the, vulnerability, of, water, networks, to, climate, variability, and, extreme, weather, events, poor, seasonal, rains, as, observed, in, the, case, of, the, panama, canal, s, lock, and, dam, infrastructure, exemplify, how, inadequate, water, supply, can, strain, water, intensive, infrastructure, raising, questions, about, engineering, legitimacy, and, the, reliability, of, water, systems, another, key, challenge, is, the, unequal, development, associated, with, large, scale, water, infrastructure, projects, such, as, dams, and, canals, such, projects, while, aimed, at, promoting, economic, growth, often, actually, reproduce, social, and, economic, inequalities, by, displacing, rural, communities, and, marginalizing, indigenous, populations, this, phenomenon, of, accumulation, by, dispossession, further, emphasizes, the, need, for, more, equitable, and, inclusive, approaches, to, water, infrastructure, development, possible, ways, to, improve, this, situation, is, simulating, of, the, network, implementing, pilot, projects, learning, from, the, costs, involved, and, the, benefits, achieved
