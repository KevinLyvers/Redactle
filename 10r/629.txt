sputnik, 1, s, p, t, n, k, s, p, t, n, k, russian, 1, satellite, 1, was, the, first, artificial, earth, satellite, it, was, launched, into, an, elliptical, low, earth, orbit, by, the, soviet, union, on, 4, october, 1957, as, part, of, the, soviet, space, program, it, sent, a, radio, signal, back, to, earth, for, three, weeks, before, its, three, silver, zinc, batteries, became, depleted, aerodynamic, drag, caused, it, to, fall, back, into, the, atmosphere, on, 4, january, 1958, the, world, s, first, observation, was, made, at, the, school, observatory, in, rodewisch, saxony, it, was, a, polished, metal, sphere, 58, cm, 23, in, in, diameter, with, four, external, radio, antennas, to, broadcast, radio, pulses, its, radio, signal, was, easily, detectable, by, amateur, radio, operators, and, the, 65, orbital, inclination, made, its, flight, path, cover, virtually, the, entire, inhabited, earth, the, satellite, s, success, was, unanticipated, by, the, united, states, this, precipitated, the, american, sputnik, crisis, and, triggered, the, space, race, part, of, the, cold, war, the, launch, was, the, beginning, of, a, new, era, of, political, military, technological, and, scientific, developments, the, word, sputnik, is, russian, for, satellite, when, interpreted, in, an, astronomical, context, its, other, meanings, are, spouse, or, traveling, companion, tracking, and, studying, sputnik, 1, from, earth, provided, scientists, with, valuable, information, the, density, of, the, upper, atmosphere, could, be, deduced, from, its, drag, on, the, orbit, and, the, propagation, of, its, radio, signals, gave, data, about, the, ionosphere, sputnik, 1, was, launched, during, the, international, geophysical, year, from, site, no, 1, 5, at, the, 5th, tyuratam, range, in, kazakh, ssr, now, known, as, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, the, satellite, traveled, at, a, peak, speed, of, about, 8, km, s, 18, 000, mph, taking, 96, 20, minutes, to, complete, each, orbit, it, transmitted, on, 20, 005, and, 40, 002, mhz, which, were, monitored, by, radio, operators, throughout, the, world, the, signals, continued, for, 22, days, until, the, transmitter, batteries, depleted, on, 26, october, 1957, on, 4, january, 1958, after, three, months, in, orbit, sputnik, 1, burned, up, while, reentering, earth, s, atmosphere, having, completed, 1, 440, orbits, of, the, earth, and, travelling, a, distance, of, approximately, 70, 000, 000, km, 43, 000, 000, mi, 1, romanized, as, sputnik, odin, pronounced, means, satellite, one, the, russian, word, for, satellite, sputnik, was, coined, in, the, 18th, century, by, combining, the, prefix, s, fellow, and, putnik, traveler, thereby, meaning, fellow, traveler, a, meaning, corresponding, to, the, latin, root, satelles, guard, attendant, or, companion, which, is, the, origin, of, english, satellite, in, english, sputnik, is, widely, recognized, as, a, proper, name, however, this, is, not, the, case, in, russian, in, the, russian, language, sputnik, is, the, general, term, for, the, artificial, satellites, of, any, country, and, the, natural, satellites, of, any, planet, the, incorrect, attribution, of, sputnik, as, a, proper, name, can, be, traced, back, to, an, article, released, by, the, new, york, times, on, october, 6, 1957, titled, soviet, sputnik, means, a, traveler, s, traveler, in, the, referenced, article, the, term, sputnik, was, portrayed, as, bearing, a, poetic, connotation, arising, from, its, linguistic, origins, this, connotation, incorrectly, indicated, that, it, was, bestowed, with, the, specific, proper, name, fellow, traveler, one, rather, than, being, designated, by, the, general, term, satellite, one, in, russian, language, references, sputnik, 1, is, recognized, by, the, technical, name, of, satellite, one, on, 17, december, 1954, chief, soviet, rocket, scientist, sergei, korolev, proposed, a, developmental, plan, for, an, artificial, satellite, to, the, minister, of, the, defense, industry, dimitri, ustinov, korolev, forwarded, a, report, by, mikhail, tikhonravov, with, an, overview, of, similar, projects, abroad, tikhonravov, had, emphasized, that, the, launch, of, an, orbital, satellite, was, an, inevitable, stage, in, the, development, of, rocket, technology, on, 29, july, 1955, u, s, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, announced, through, his, press, secretary, that, during, the, international, geophysical, year, igy, the, united, states, would, launch, an, artificial, satellite, four, days, later, leonid, sedov, a, leading, soviet, physicist, announced, that, they, too, would, launch, an, artificial, satellite, on, 8, august, the, politburo, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, approved, the, proposal, to, create, an, artificial, satellite, on, 30, august, vasily, ryabikov, the, head, of, the, state, commission, on, the, r, 7, rocket, test, launches, held, a, meeting, where, korolev, presented, calculation, data, for, a, spaceflight, trajectory, to, the, moon, they, decided, to, develop, a, three, stage, version, of, the, r, 7, rocket, for, satellite, launches, on, 30, january, 1956, the, council, of, ministers, approved, practical, work, on, an, artificial, earth, orbiting, satellite, this, satellite, named, object, d, was, planned, to, be, completed, in, 1957, 58, it, would, have, a, mass, of, 1, 000, to, 1, 400, kg, 2, 200, to, 3, 100, lb, and, would, carry, 200, to, 300, kg, 440, to, 660, lb, of, scientific, instruments, the, first, test, launch, of, object, d, was, scheduled, for, 1957, work, on, the, satellite, was, to, be, divided, among, institutions, as, follows, preliminary, design, work, was, completed, in, july, 1956, and, the, scientific, tasks, to, be, carried, out, by, the, satellite, were, defined, these, included, measuring, the, density, of, the, atmosphere, and, its, ion, composition, the, solar, wind, magnetic, fields, and, cosmic, rays, these, data, would, be, valuable, in, the, creation, of, future, artificial, satellites, a, system, of, ground, stations, was, to, be, developed, to, collect, data, transmitted, by, the, satellite, observe, the, satellite, s, orbit, and, transmit, commands, to, the, satellite, because, of, the, limited, time, frame, observations, were, planned, for, only, 7, to, 10, days, and, orbit, calculations, were, not, expected, to, be, extremely, accurate, by, the, end, of, 1956, it, became, clear, that, the, complexity, of, the, ambitious, design, meant, that, object, d, could, not, be, launched, in, time, because, of, difficulties, creating, scientific, instruments, and, the, low, specific, impulse, produced, by, the, completed, r, 7, engines, 304, sec, instead, of, the, planned, 309, to, 310, sec, consequently, the, government, rescheduled, the, launch, for, april, 1958, object, d, would, later, fly, as, sputnik, 3, fearing, the, u, s, would, launch, a, satellite, before, the, ussr, okb, 1, suggested, the, creation, and, launch, of, a, satellite, in, april, may, 1957, before, the, igy, began, in, july, 1957, the, new, satellite, would, be, simple, light, 100, kg, or, 220, lb, and, easy, to, construct, forgoing, the, complex, heavy, scientific, equipment, in, favour, of, a, simple, radio, transmitter, on, 15, february, 1957, the, council, of, ministers, of, the, ussr, approved, this, simple, satellite, designated, object, ps, ps, meaning, prosteishiy, sputnik, or, elementary, satellite, this, version, allowed, the, satellite, to, be, tracked, visually, by, earth, based, observers, and, it, could, transmit, tracking, signals, to, ground, based, receiving, stations, the, launch, of, two, satellites, ps, 1, and, ps, 2, with, two, r, 7, rockets, 8k71, was, approved, provided, that, the, r, 7, completed, at, least, two, successful, test, flights, the, r, 7, rocket, was, initially, designed, as, an, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, icbm, by, okb, 1, the, decision, to, build, it, was, made, by, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, council, of, ministers, of, the, ussr, on, 20, may, 1954, the, rocket, was, the, most, powerful, in, the, world, it, was, designed, with, excess, thrust, since, they, were, unsure, how, heavy, the, hydrogen, bomb, payload, would, be, the, r, 7, was, also, known, by, its, grau, later, gurvo, the, russian, abbreviation, for, chief, directorate, of, the, rocket, forces, designation, 8k71, at, the, time, the, r, 7, was, known, to, nato, sources, as, the, t, 3, or, m, 104, and, type, a, several, modifications, were, made, to, the, r, 7, rocket, to, adapt, it, to, object, d, including, upgrades, to, the, main, engines, the, removal, of, a, 300, kg, radio, package, on, the, booster, and, a, new, payload, fairing, that, made, the, booster, almost, four, meters, shorter, than, its, icbm, version, object, d, would, later, be, launched, as, sputnik, 3, after, the, much, lighter, object, ps, sputnik, 1, was, launched, first, the, trajectory, of, the, launch, vehicle, and, the, satellite, were, initially, calculated, using, arithmometers, and, six, digit, trigonometric, tables, more, complex, calculations, were, carried, out, on, a, newly, installed, computer, at, the, academy, of, sciences, a, special, reconnaissance, commission, selected, tyuratam, for, the, construction, of, a, rocket, proving, ground, the, 5th, tyuratam, range, usually, referred, to, as, niip, 5, or, gik, 5, in, the, post, soviet, time, the, selection, was, approved, on, 12, february, 1955, by, the, council, of, ministers, of, the, ussr, but, the, site, would, not, be, completed, until, 1958, actual, work, on, the, construction, of, the, site, began, on, 20, july, by, military, building, units, the, first, launch, of, an, r, 7, rocket, 8k71, no, 5l, occurred, on, 15, may, 1957, a, fire, began, in, the, blok, d, strap, on, almost, immediately, at, liftoff, but, the, booster, continued, flying, until, 98, seconds, after, launch, when, the, strap, on, broke, away, and, the, vehicle, crashed, some, 400, km, 250, mi, downrange, three, attempts, to, launch, the, second, rocket, 8k71, no, 6, were, made, on, 10, 11, june, but, an, assembly, defect, prevented, launch, the, unsuccessful, launch, of, the, third, r, 7, rocket, 8k71, no, 7, took, place, on, 12, july, an, electrical, short, caused, the, vernier, engines, to, put, the, missile, into, an, uncontrolled, roll, which, resulted, in, all, of, the, strap, ons, separating, 33, seconds, into, the, launch, the, r, 7, crashed, about, 7, km, 4, 3, mi, from, the, pad, the, launch, of, the, fourth, rocket, 8k71, no, 8, on, 21, august, at, 15, 25, moscow, time, was, successful, the, rocket, s, core, boosted, the, dummy, warhead, to, the, target, altitude, and, velocity, reentered, the, atmosphere, and, broke, apart, at, a, height, of, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, after, traveling, 6, 000, km, 3, 700, mi, on, 27, august, the, tass, issued, a, statement, on, the, successful, launch, of, a, long, distance, multistage, icbm, the, launch, of, the, fifth, r, 7, rocket, 8k71, no, 9, on, 7, september, was, also, successful, but, the, dummy, was, also, destroyed, on, atmospheric, re, entry, and, hence, needed, a, redesign, to, completely, fulfill, its, military, purpose, the, rocket, however, was, deemed, suitable, for, satellite, launches, and, korolev, was, able, to, convince, the, state, commission, to, allow, the, use, of, the, next, r, 7, to, launch, ps, 1, allowing, the, delay, in, the, rocket, s, military, exploitation, to, launch, the, ps, 1, and, ps, 2, satellites, on, 22, september, a, modified, r, 7, rocket, named, sputnik, and, indexed, as, 8k71ps, arrived, at, the, proving, ground, and, preparations, for, the, launch, of, ps, 1, began, compared, to, the, military, r, 7, test, vehicles, the, mass, of, 8k71ps, was, reduced, from, 280, t, to, 272, t, its, length, with, ps, 1, was, 29, 167, metres, 95, ft, 8, 3, in, and, the, thrust, at, liftoff, was, 3, 90, mn, 880, 000, lb, f, ps, 1, was, not, designed, to, be, controlled, it, could, only, be, observed, initial, data, at, the, launch, site, would, be, collected, at, six, separate, observatories, and, telegraphed, to, nii, 4, located, back, in, moscow, at, bolshevo, nii, 4, was, a, scientific, research, arm, of, the, ministry, of, defence, that, was, dedicated, to, missile, development, the, six, observatories, were, clustered, around, the, launch, site, with, the, closest, situated, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, from, the, launch, pad, a, second, nationwide, observation, complex, was, established, to, track, the, satellite, after, its, separation, from, the, rocket, called, the, command, measurement, complex, it, consisted, of, the, coordination, center, in, nii, 4, and, seven, distant, stations, situated, along, the, line, of, the, satellite, s, ground, track, these, tracking, stations, were, located, at, tyuratam, sary, shagan, yeniseysk, klyuchi, yelizovo, makat, in, guryev, oblast, and, ishkup, in, krasnoyarsk, krai, stations, were, equipped, with, radar, optical, instruments, and, communications, systems, data, from, stations, were, transmitted, by, telegraphs, into, nii, 4, where, ballistics, specialists, calculated, orbital, parameters, the, observatories, used, a, trajectory, measurement, system, called, tral, developed, by, okb, mei, moscow, energy, institute, by, which, they, received, and, monitored, data, from, transponders, mounted, on, the, r, 7, rocket, s, core, stage, the, data, was, useful, even, after, the, satellite, s, separation, from, the, second, stage, of, the, rocket, sputnik, s, location, was, calculated, from, the, data, on, the, second, stage, s, location, which, followed, sputnik, at, a, known, distance, tracking, of, the, booster, during, launch, had, to, be, accomplished, through, purely, passive, means, such, as, visual, coverage, and, radar, detection, r, 7, test, launches, demonstrated, that, the, tracking, cameras, were, only, good, up, to, an, altitude, of, 200, km, 120, mi, but, radar, could, track, it, for, almost, 500, km, 310, mi, outside, the, soviet, union, the, satellite, was, tracked, by, amateur, radio, operators, in, many, countries, the, booster, rocket, was, located, and, tracked, by, the, british, using, the, lovell, telescope, at, the, jodrell, bank, observatory, the, only, telescope, in, the, world, able, to, do, so, by, radar, canada, s, newbrook, observatory, was, the, first, facility, in, north, america, to, photograph, sputnik, 1, sputnik, 1, was, designed, to, meet, a, set, of, guidelines, and, objectives, such, as, the, chief, constructor, of, sputnik, 1, at, okb, 1, was, mikhail, s, khomyakov, the, satellite, was, a, 585, millimetre, 23, 0, in, diameter, sphere, assembled, from, two, hemispheres, that, were, hermetically, sealed, with, o, rings, and, connected, by, 36, bolts, it, had, a, mass, of, 83, 6, kilograms, 184, lb, the, hemispheres, were, 2, mm, thick, and, were, covered, with, a, highly, polished, 1, mm, thick, heat, shield, made, of, an, aluminium, magnesium, titanium, alloy, amg6t, the, satellite, carried, two, pairs, of, antennas, designed, by, the, antenna, laboratory, of, okb, 1, led, by, mikhail, v, krayushkin, each, antenna, was, made, up, of, two, whip, like, parts, 2, 4, and, 2, 9, metres, 7, 9, and, 9, 5, ft, in, length, and, had, an, almost, spherical, radiation, pattern, the, power, supply, with, a, mass, of, 51, kg, 112, lb, was, in, the, shape, of, an, octagonal, nut, with, the, radio, transmitter, in, its, hole, it, consisted, of, three, silver, zinc, batteries, developed, at, the, all, union, research, institute, of, power, sources, vniit, under, the, leadership, of, nikolai, s, lidorenko, two, of, these, batteries, powered, the, radio, transmitter, and, one, powered, the, temperature, regulation, system, the, batteries, had, an, expected, lifetime, of, two, weeks, and, operated, for, 22, days, the, power, supply, was, turned, on, automatically, at, the, moment, of, the, satellite, s, separation, from, the, second, stage, of, the, rocket, the, satellite, had, a, one, watt, 3, 5, kg, 7, 7, lb, radio, transmitting, unit, inside, developed, by, vyacheslav, i, lappo, from, nii, 885, the, moscow, electronics, research, institute, that, worked, on, two, frequencies, 20, 005, and, 40, 002, mhz, signals, on, the, first, frequency, were, transmitted, in, 0, 3, s, pulses, near, f, 3, hz, under, normal, temperature, and, pressure, conditions, on, board, with, pauses, of, the, same, duration, filled, by, pulses, on, the, second, frequency, analysis, of, the, radio, signals, was, used, to, gather, information, about, the, electron, density, of, the, ionosphere, temperature, and, pressure, were, encoded, in, the, duration, of, radio, beeps, a, temperature, regulation, system, contained, a, fan, a, dual, thermal, switch, and, a, control, thermal, switch, if, the, temperature, inside, the, satellite, exceeded, 36, c, 97, f, the, fan, was, turned, on, when, it, fell, below, 20, c, 68, f, the, fan, was, turned, off, by, the, dual, thermal, switch, if, the, temperature, exceeded, 50, c, 122, f, or, fell, below, 0, c, 32, f, another, control, thermal, switch, was, activated, changing, the, duration, of, the, radio, signal, pulses, sputnik, 1, was, filled, with, dry, nitrogen, pressurized, to, 1, 3, atm, 130, kpa, the, satellite, had, a, barometric, switch, activated, if, the, pressure, inside, the, satellite, fell, below, 130, kpa, which, would, have, indicated, failure, of, the, pressure, vessel, or, puncture, by, a, meteor, and, would, have, changed, the, duration, of, radio, signal, impulse, while, attached, to, the, rocket, sputnik, 1, was, protected, by, a, cone, shaped, payload, fairing, with, a, height, of, 80, cm, 31, 5, in, the, fairing, separated, from, both, sputnik, and, the, spent, r, 7, second, stage, at, the, same, time, as, the, satellite, was, ejected, tests, of, the, satellite, were, conducted, at, okb, 1, under, the, leadership, of, oleg, g, ivanovsky, the, control, system, of, the, sputnik, rocket, was, adjusted, to, an, intended, orbit, of, 223, by, 1, 450, km, 139, by, 901, mi, with, an, orbital, period, of, 101, 5, minutes, the, trajectory, had, been, calculated, earlier, by, georgi, grechko, using, the, ussr, academy, of, sciences, mainframe, computer, the, sputnik, rocket, was, launched, on, 4, october, 1957, at, 19, 28, 34, utc, 5, october, at, the, launch, site, from, site, no, 1, at, niip, 5, telemetry, indicated, that, the, strap, ons, separated, 116, seconds, into, the, flight, and, the, core, stage, engine, shut, down, 295, 4, seconds, into, the, flight, at, shutdown, the, 7, 5, tonne, core, stage, with, ps, 1, attached, had, attained, an, altitude, of, 223, km, 139, mi, above, sea, level, a, velocity, of, 7, 780, m, s, 25, 500, ft, s, and, a, velocity, vector, inclination, to, the, local, horizon, of, 0, degrees, 24, minutes, this, resulted, in, an, initial, elliptical, orbit, of, 223, km, 139, mi, by, 950, km, 590, mi, with, an, apogee, approximately, 500, km, 310, mi, lower, than, intended, and, an, inclination, of, 65, 10, and, a, period, of, 96, 20, minutes, several, engines, did, not, fire, on, time, almost, aborting, the, mission, a, fuel, regulator, in, the, booster, also, failed, around, 16, seconds, into, launch, which, resulted, in, excessive, rp, 1, consumption, for, most, of, the, powered, flight, and, the, engine, thrust, being, 4, above, nominal, core, stage, cutoff, was, intended, for, t, 296, seconds, but, the, premature, propellant, depletion, caused, thrust, termination, to, occur, one, second, earlier, when, a, sensor, detected, overspeed, of, the, empty, rp, 1, turbopump, there, were, 375, kg, 827, lb, of, lox, remaining, at, cutoff, at, 19, 9, seconds, after, engine, cut, off, ps, 1, separated, from, the, second, stage, and, the, satellite, s, transmitter, was, activated, these, signals, were, detected, at, the, ip, 1, station, by, junior, engineer, lieutenant, v, g, borisov, where, reception, of, sputnik, 1, s, beep, beep, beep, tones, confirmed, the, satellite, s, successful, deployment, reception, lasted, for, 2, minutes, until, ps, 1, fell, below, the, horizon, the, tral, telemetry, system, on, the, r, 7, core, stage, continued, to, transmit, and, was, detected, on, its, second, orbit, the, designers, engineers, and, technicians, who, developed, the, rocket, and, satellite, watched, the, launch, from, the, range, after, the, launch, they, drove, to, the, mobile, radio, station, to, listen, for, signals, from, the, satellite, they, waited, about, 90, minutes, to, ensure, that, the, satellite, had, made, one, orbit, and, was, transmitting, before, korolev, called, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, on, the, first, orbit, the, telegraph, agency, of, the, soviet, union, tass, transmitted, as, result, of, great, intense, work, of, scientific, institutes, and, design, bureaus, the, first, artificial, earth, satellite, has, been, built, the, r, 7, core, stage, with, a, mass, of, 7, 5, tonnes, and, a, length, of, 26, metres, also, reached, earth, orbit, it, was, a, first, magnitude, object, following, behind, the, satellite, and, visible, at, night, deployable, reflective, panels, were, placed, on, the, booster, in, order, to, increase, its, visibility, for, tracking, a, small, highly, polished, sphere, the, satellite, was, barely, visible, at, sixth, magnitude, and, thus, harder, to, follow, optically, the, batteries, ran, out, on, 26, october, 1957, after, the, satellite, completed, 326, orbits, the, core, stage, of, the, r, 7, remained, in, orbit, for, two, months, until, 2, december, 1957, while, sputnik, 1, orbited, for, three, months, until, 4, january, 1958, having, completed, 1, 440, orbits, of, the, earth, organized, through, the, citizen, science, project, operation, moonwatch, teams, of, visual, observers, at, 150, stations, in, the, united, states, and, other, countries, were, alerted, during, the, night, to, watch, for, the, satellite, at, dawn, and, during, the, evening, twilight, as, it, passed, overhead, the, ussr, requested, amateur, and, professional, radio, operators, to, tape, record, the, signal, being, transmitted, from, the, satellite, news, reports, at, the, time, pointed, out, that, anyone, possessing, a, short, wave, receiver, can, hear, the, new, russian, earth, satellite, as, it, hurtles, over, this, area, of, the, globe, directions, provided, by, the, american, radio, relay, league, were, to, tune, in, 20, megacycles, sharply, by, the, time, signals, given, on, that, frequency, then, tune, to, slightly, higher, frequencies, the, beep, beep, sound, of, the, satellite, can, be, heard, each, time, it, rounds, the, globe, the, first, recording, of, sputnik, 1, s, signal, was, made, by, rca, engineers, near, riverhead, long, island, they, then, drove, the, tape, recording, into, manhattan, for, broadcast, to, the, public, over, nbc, radio, however, as, sputnik, rose, higher, over, the, east, coast, its, signal, was, picked, up, by, w2aee, the, ham, radio, station, of, columbia, university, students, working, in, the, university, s, fm, station, wkcr, made, a, tape, of, this, and, were, the, first, to, rebroadcast, the, sputnik, signal, to, the, american, public, or, whoever, could, receive, the, fm, station, the, soviet, union, agreed, to, transmit, on, frequencies, that, worked, with, the, united, states, existing, infrastructure, but, later, announced, the, lower, frequencies, asserting, that, the, launch, did, not, come, as, a, surprise, the, white, house, refused, to, comment, on, any, military, aspects, on, 5, october, the, naval, research, laboratory, captured, recordings, of, sputnik, 1, during, four, crossings, over, the, united, states, the, usaf, cambridge, research, center, collaborated, with, bendix, friez, westinghouse, broadcasting, and, the, smithsonian, astrophysical, observatory, to, obtain, a, video, of, sputnik, s, rocket, body, crossing, the, pre, dawn, sky, of, baltimore, broadcast, on, 12, october, by, wbz, tv, in, boston, the, success, of, sputnik, 1, seemed, to, have, changed, minds, around, the, world, regarding, a, shift, in, power, to, the, soviets, the, ussr, s, launch, of, sputnik, 1, spurred, the, united, states, to, create, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, arpa, later, darpa, in, february, 1958, to, regain, a, technological, lead, in, britain, the, media, and, population, initially, reacted, with, a, mixture, of, fear, for, the, future, but, also, amazement, about, human, progress, many, newspapers, and, magazines, heralded, the, arrival, of, the, space, age, however, when, the, ussr, launched, sputnik, 2, containing, the, dog, laika, the, media, narrative, returned, to, one, of, anti, communism, and, many, people, sent, protests, to, the, soviet, embassy, and, the, rspca, sputnik, 1, was, not, immediately, used, for, soviet, propaganda, the, soviets, had, kept, quiet, about, their, earlier, accomplishments, in, rocketry, fearing, that, it, would, lead, to, secrets, being, revealed, and, failures, being, exploited, by, the, west, when, the, soviets, began, using, sputnik, in, their, propaganda, they, emphasized, pride, in, the, achievement, of, soviet, technology, arguing, that, it, demonstrated, the, soviets, superiority, over, the, west, people, were, encouraged, to, listen, to, sputnik, s, signals, on, the, radio, and, to, look, out, for, sputnik, in, the, night, sky, while, sputnik, itself, had, been, highly, polished, its, small, size, made, it, barely, visible, to, the, naked, eye, what, most, watchers, actually, saw, was, the, much, more, visible, 26, metre, core, stage, of, the, r, 7, shortly, after, the, launch, of, ps, 1, khrushchev, pressed, korolev, to, launch, another, satellite, to, coincide, with, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, on, 7, november, 1957, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, surprised, the, american, public, and, shattered, the, perception, created, by, american, propaganda, of, the, united, states, as, the, technological, superpower, and, the, soviet, union, as, a, backward, country, privately, however, the, cia, and, president, eisenhower, were, aware, of, progress, being, made, by, the, soviets, on, sputnik, from, secret, spy, plane, imagery, together, with, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, jpl, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, built, explorer, 1, and, launched, it, on, 31, january, 1958, before, work, was, completed, however, the, soviet, union, launched, a, second, satellite, sputnik, 2, on, 3, november, 1957, meanwhile, the, televised, failure, of, vanguard, tv, 3, on, 6, december, 1957, deepened, american, dismay, over, the, country, s, position, in, the, space, race, the, americans, took, a, more, aggressive, stance, in, the, emerging, space, race, resulting, in, an, emphasis, on, science, and, technological, research, and, reforms, in, many, areas, from, the, military, to, education, systems, the, federal, government, began, investing, in, science, engineering, and, mathematics, at, all, levels, of, education, an, advanced, research, group, was, assembled, for, military, purposes, these, research, groups, developed, weapons, such, as, icbms, and, missile, defense, systems, as, well, as, spy, satellites, for, the, u, s, initially, u, s, president, dwight, eisenhower, was, not, surprised, by, sputnik, 1, he, had, been, forewarned, of, the, r, 7, s, capabilities, by, information, derived, from, u, 2, spy, plane, overflight, photos, as, well, as, signals, and, telemetry, intercepts, general, james, m, gavin, wrote, in, 1958, that, he, had, predicted, to, the, army, scientific, advisory, panel, on, 12, september, 1957, that, the, soviets, would, launch, a, satellite, within, 30, days, and, that, on, 4, october, he, and, wernher, von, braun, had, agreed, that, a, launch, was, imminent, the, eisenhower, administration, s, first, response, was, low, key, and, almost, dismissive, eisenhower, was, even, pleased, that, the, ussr, not, the, u, s, would, be, the, first, to, test, the, waters, of, the, still, uncertain, legal, status, of, orbital, satellite, overflights, eisenhower, had, suffered, the, soviet, protests, and, shoot, downs, of, project, genetrix, moby, dick, balloons, and, was, concerned, about, the, probability, of, a, u, 2, being, shot, down, to, set, a, precedent, for, freedom, of, space, before, the, launch, of, america, s, secret, ws, 117l, spy, satellites, the, u, s, had, launched, project, vanguard, as, its, own, civilian, satellite, entry, for, the, international, geophysical, year, eisenhower, greatly, underestimated, the, reaction, of, the, american, public, who, were, shocked, by, the, launch, of, sputnik, and, by, the, televised, failure, of, the, vanguard, test, vehicle, 3, launch, attempt, the, sense, of, anxiety, was, inflamed, by, democratic, politicians, and, professional, cold, warriors, who, portrayed, the, united, states, as, woefully, behind, one, of, the, many, books, that, suddenly, appeared, for, the, lay, audience, noted, seven, points, of, impact, upon, the, nation, western, leadership, western, strategy, and, tactics, missile, production, applied, research, basic, research, education, and, democratic, culture, as, public, and, the, government, became, interested, in, space, and, related, science, and, technology, the, phenomenon, was, sometimes, dubbed, the, sputnik, craze, the, u, s, soon, had, a, number, of, successful, satellites, including, explorer, 1, project, score, and, courier, 1b, however, public, reaction, to, the, sputnik, crisis, spurred, america, to, action, in, the, space, race, leading, to, the, creation, of, both, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, renamed, the, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, or, darpa, in, 1972, and, nasa, through, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, act, as, well, as, increased, u, s, government, spending, on, scientific, research, and, education, through, the, national, defense, education, act, sputnik, also, contributed, directly, to, a, new, emphasis, on, science, and, technology, in, american, schools, with, a, sense, of, urgency, congress, enacted, the, 1958, national, defense, education, act, which, provided, low, interest, loans, for, college, tuition, to, students, majoring, in, mathematics, and, science, after, the, launch, of, sputnik, a, poll, conducted, and, published, by, the, university, of, michigan, showed, that, 26, of, americans, surveyed, thought, that, russian, sciences, and, engineering, were, superior, to, that, of, the, united, states, a, year, later, however, that, figure, had, dropped, to, 10, as, the, u, s, began, launching, its, own, satellites, into, space, one, consequence, of, the, sputnik, shock, was, the, perception, of, a, missile, gap, this, became, a, dominant, issue, in, the, 1960, presidential, campaign, one, irony, of, the, sputnik, event, was, the, initially, low, key, response, of, the, soviet, union, the, communist, party, newspaper, pravda, only, printed, a, few, paragraphs, about, sputnik, 1, on, 4, october, sputnik, also, inspired, a, generation, of, engineers, and, scientists, harrison, storms, the, north, american, designer, who, was, responsible, for, the, x, 15, rocket, plane, and, went, on, to, head, the, effort, to, design, the, apollo, command, and, service, module, and, saturn, v, launch, vehicle, s, second, stage, was, moved, by, the, launch, of, sputnik, to, think, of, space, as, being, the, next, step, for, america, astronauts, alan, shepard, who, was, the, first, american, in, space, and, deke, slayton, later, wrote, of, how, the, sight, of, sputnik, 1, passing, overhead, inspired, them, to, their, new, careers, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, led, to, the, resurgence, of, the, suffix, nik, in, the, english, language, the, american, writer, herb, caen, was, inspired, to, coin, the, term, beatnik, in, an, article, about, the, beat, generation, in, the, san, francisco, chronicle, on, 2, april, 1958, the, flag, of, the, russian, city, of, kaluga, which, due, to, it, being, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, s, place, of, work, and, residency, is, very, dedicated, to, space, and, space, travel, features, a, small, sputnik, in, the, canton, on, october, 3, 2007, google, celebrated, 50th, anniversary, with, a, google, doodle, the, launch, of, sputnik, also, planted, the, seeds, for, the, development, of, modern, satellite, navigation, two, american, physicists, william, guier, and, george, weiffenbach, at, johns, hopkins, university, s, applied, physics, laboratory, apl, decided, to, monitor, sputnik, s, radio, transmissions, and, within, hours, realized, that, because, of, the, doppler, effect, they, could, pinpoint, where, the, satellite, was, along, its, orbit, the, director, of, the, apl, gave, them, access, to, their, univac, computer, to, do, the, then, heavy, calculations, required, early, the, next, year, frank, mcclure, the, deputy, director, of, the, apl, asked, guier, and, weiffenbach, to, investigate, the, inverse, problem, pinpointing, the, user, s, location, given, the, satellite, s, at, the, time, the, navy, was, developing, the, submarine, launched, polaris, missile, which, required, them, to, know, the, submarine, s, location, this, led, them, and, apl, to, develop, the, transit, system, a, forerunner, of, modern, global, positioning, system, gps, satellites, at, least, two, vintage, duplicates, of, sputnik, 1, exist, built, apparently, as, backup, units, the, first, resides, near, moscow, in, the, corporate, museum, of, energia, the, modern, descendant, of, korolev, s, design, bureau, where, it, is, on, display, by, appointment, only, the, second, is, a, flight, ready, backup, at, the, cosmosphere, space, museum, in, hutchinson, kansas, which, also, has, an, engineering, model, of, the, sputnik, 2, the, museum, of, flight, in, seattle, washington, has, a, sputnik, 1, but, it, has, no, internal, components, though, it, does, have, casings, and, molded, fittings, inside, as, well, as, evidence, of, battery, wear, which, may, be, an, engineering, model, authenticated, by, the, memorial, museum, of, cosmonautics, in, moscow, the, unit, was, auctioned, in, 2001, and, purchased, by, an, anonymous, private, buyer, who, donated, it, to, the, museum, the, sputnik, 1, emc, emi, is, a, class, of, full, scale, laboratory, models, of, the, satellite, the, models, manufactured, by, okb, 1, and, nii, 885, headed, by, mikhail, ryazansky, were, introduced, on, february, 15, 1957, they, were, made, to, test, ground, electromagnetic, compatibility, emc, and, electromagnetic, interference, emi, in, 1959, the, soviet, union, donated, a, replica, of, sputnik, to, the, united, nations, there, are, other, full, size, sputnik, replicas, with, varying, degrees, of, accuracy, on, display, in, locations, around, the, world, including, the, national, air, and, space, museum, in, the, united, states, the, science, museum, in, the, united, kingdom, the, powerhouse, museum, in, australia, and, outside, the, russian, embassy, in, spain, three, one, third, scale, student, built, replicas, of, sputnik, 1, were, deployed, from, the, mir, space, station, between, 1997, and, 1999, the, first, named, sputnik, 40, to, commemorate, the, fortieth, anniversary, of, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, was, deployed, in, november, 1997, sputnik, 41, was, launched, a, year, later, and, sputnik, 99, was, deployed, in, february, 1999, a, fourth, replica, was, launched, but, never, deployed, and, was, destroyed, when, mir, was, deorbited, two, more, sputniks, are, claimed, to, be, in, the, personal, collections, of, american, entrepreneurs, richard, garriott, and, jay, s, walker
