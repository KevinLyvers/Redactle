a, printing, press, is, a, mechanical, device, for, applying, pressure, to, an, inked, surface, resting, upon, a, print, medium, such, as, paper, or, cloth, thereby, transferring, the, ink, it, marked, a, dramatic, improvement, on, earlier, printing, methods, in, which, the, cloth, paper, or, other, medium, was, brushed, or, rubbed, repeatedly, to, achieve, the, transfer, of, ink, and, accelerated, the, process, typically, used, for, texts, the, invention, and, global, spread, of, the, printing, press, was, one, of, the, most, influential, events, in, the, second, millennium, in, germany, around, 1440, the, goldsmith, johannes, gutenberg, invented, the, movable, type, printing, press, which, started, the, printing, revolution, modelled, on, the, design, of, existing, screw, presses, a, single, renaissance, movable, type, printing, press, could, produce, up, to, 3, 600, pages, per, workday, compared, to, forty, by, hand, printing, and, a, few, by, hand, copying, gutenberg, s, newly, devised, hand, mould, made, possible, the, precise, and, rapid, creation, of, metal, movable, type, in, large, quantities, his, two, inventions, the, hand, mould, and, the, movable, type, printing, press, together, drastically, reduced, the, cost, of, printing, books, and, other, documents, in, europe, particularly, for, shorter, print, runs, from, mainz, the, movable, type, printing, press, spread, within, several, decades, to, over, 200, cities, in, a, dozen, european, countries, by, 1500, printing, presses, in, operation, throughout, western, europe, had, already, produced, more, than, 20, million, volumes, in, the, 16th, century, with, presses, spreading, further, afield, their, output, rose, tenfold, to, an, estimated, 150, to, 200, million, copies, by, the, mid, 17th, century, the, first, printing, presses, arrived, in, colonial, america, in, response, to, the, increasing, demand, for, bibles, and, other, religious, literature, the, operation, of, a, press, became, synonymous, with, the, enterprise, of, printing, and, lent, its, name, to, a, new, medium, of, expression, and, communication, the, press, the, spread, of, mechanical, movable, type, printing, in, europe, in, the, renaissance, introduced, the, era, of, mass, communication, which, permanently, altered, the, structure, of, society, the, relatively, unrestricted, circulation, of, information, and, revolutionary, ideas, transcended, borders, captured, the, masses, in, the, reformation, and, threatened, the, power, of, political, and, religious, authorities, the, sharp, increase, in, literacy, broke, the, monopoly, of, the, literate, elite, on, education, and, learning, and, bolstered, the, emerging, middle, class, across, europe, the, increasing, cultural, self, awareness, of, its, peoples, led, to, the, rise, of, proto, nationalism, and, accelerated, the, development, of, european, vernaculars, to, the, detriment, of, latin, s, status, as, lingua, franca, in, the, 19th, century, the, replacement, of, the, hand, operated, gutenberg, style, press, by, steam, powered, rotary, presses, allowed, printing, on, an, industrial, scale, the, rapid, economic, and, socio, cultural, development, of, late, medieval, society, in, europe, created, favorable, intellectual, and, technological, conditions, for, gutenberg, s, improved, version, of, the, printing, press, the, entrepreneurial, spirit, of, emerging, capitalism, increasingly, made, its, impact, on, medieval, modes, of, production, fostering, economic, thinking, and, improving, the, efficiency, of, traditional, work, processes, the, sharp, rise, of, medieval, learning, and, literacy, amongst, the, middle, class, led, to, an, increased, demand, for, books, which, the, time, consuming, hand, copying, method, fell, far, short, of, accommodating, technologies, preceding, the, press, that, led, to, the, press, s, invention, included, manufacturing, of, paper, development, of, ink, woodblock, printing, and, invention, of, eyeglasses, at, the, same, time, a, number, of, medieval, products, and, technological, processes, had, reached, a, level, of, maturity, which, allowed, their, potential, use, for, printing, purposes, gutenberg, took, up, these, far, flung, strands, combined, them, into, one, complete, and, functioning, system, and, perfected, the, printing, process, through, all, its, stages, by, adding, a, number, of, inventions, and, innovations, of, his, own, the, screw, press, which, allowed, direct, pressure, to, be, applied, on, a, flat, plane, was, already, of, great, antiquity, in, gutenberg, s, time, and, was, used, for, a, wide, range, of, tasks, introduced, in, the, 1st, century, ad, by, the, romans, it, was, commonly, employed, in, agricultural, production, for, pressing, grapes, for, wine, and, olives, for, oil, both, of, which, formed, an, integral, part, of, the, mediterranean, and, medieval, diet, the, device, was, also, used, from, very, early, on, in, urban, contexts, as, a, cloth, press, for, printing, patterns, gutenberg, may, have, also, been, inspired, by, the, paper, presses, which, had, spread, through, the, german, lands, since, the, late, 14th, century, and, which, worked, on, the, same, mechanical, principles, during, the, islamic, golden, age, arab, muslims, were, printing, texts, including, passages, from, the, qur, an, embracing, the, chinese, craft, of, paper, making, developed, it, and, adopted, it, widely, in, the, muslim, world, which, led, to, a, major, increase, in, the, production, of, manuscript, texts, in, egypt, during, the, fatimid, era, the, printing, technique, was, adopted, reproducing, texts, on, paper, strips, by, hand, and, supplying, them, in, various, copies, to, meet, the, demand, gutenberg, adopted, the, basic, design, thereby, mechanizing, the, printing, process, printing, however, put, a, demand, on, the, machine, quite, different, from, pressing, gutenberg, adapted, the, construction, so, that, the, pressing, power, exerted, by, the, platen, on, the, paper, was, now, applied, both, evenly, and, with, the, required, sudden, elasticity, to, speed, up, the, printing, process, he, introduced, a, movable, undertable, with, a, plane, surface, on, which, the, sheets, could, be, swiftly, changed, the, concept, of, movable, type, existed, prior, to, 15th, century, europe, sporadic, evidence, that, the, typographical, principle, the, idea, of, creating, a, text, by, reusing, individual, characters, was, known, and, had, been, cropping, up, since, the, 12th, century, and, possibly, before, the, oldest, known, application, dating, back, as, far, as, the, phaistos, disc, the, first, movable, type, was, invented, by, chinese, engineer, bi, sheng, in, the, 11th, century, during, the, song, dynasty, and, a, book, dating, to, 1193, recorded, the, first, copper, movable, type, however, this, received, limited, use, compared, to, woodblock, printing, nevertheless, the, technology, spread, outside, china, as, the, oldest, printed, book, using, metal, movable, type, was, the, jikji, printed, in, korea, in, 1377, during, the, goryeo, era, other, notable, examples, include, the, pr, fening, inscription, from, germany, letter, tiles, from, england, and, altarpiece, of, pellegrino, ii, in, italy, however, the, various, techniques, employed, imprinting, punching, and, assembling, individual, letters, did, not, have, the, refinement, and, efficiency, needed, to, become, widely, accepted, tsuen, hsuin, and, needham, and, briggs, and, burke, suggest, that, the, movable, type, printing, in, china, and, korea, was, rarely, employed, gutenberg, greatly, improved, the, process, by, treating, typesetting, and, printing, as, two, separate, work, steps, a, goldsmith, by, profession, he, created, his, type, pieces, from, a, lead, based, alloy, which, suited, printing, purposes, so, well, that, it, is, still, used, today, the, mass, production, of, metal, letters, was, achieved, by, his, key, invention, of, a, special, hand, mould, the, matrix, the, latin, alphabet, proved, to, be, an, enormous, advantage, in, the, process, because, in, contrast, to, logographic, writing, systems, it, allowed, the, type, setter, to, represent, any, text, with, a, theoretical, minimum, of, only, around, two, dozen, different, letters, another, factor, conducive, to, printing, arose, from, the, book, existing, in, the, format, of, the, codex, which, had, originated, in, the, roman, period, considered, the, most, important, advance, in, the, history, of, the, book, prior, to, printing, itself, the, codex, had, completely, replaced, the, ancient, scroll, at, the, onset, of, the, middle, ages, ad, 500, the, codex, holds, considerable, practical, advantages, over, the, scroll, format, it, is, more, convenient, to, read, by, turning, pages, more, compact, and, less, costly, and, both, recto, and, verso, sides, could, be, used, for, writing, or, printing, unlike, the, scroll, a, fourth, development, was, the, early, success, of, medieval, papermakers, at, mechanizing, paper, manufacture, the, introduction, of, water, powered, paper, mills, the, first, certain, evidence, of, which, dates, to, 1282, allowed, for, a, massive, expansion, of, production, and, replaced, the, laborious, handcraft, characteristic, of, both, chinese, and, muslim, papermaking, papermaking, centres, began, to, multiply, in, the, late, 13th, century, in, italy, reducing, the, price, of, paper, to, one, sixth, of, parchment, and, then, falling, further, papermaking, centers, reached, germany, a, century, later, despite, this, it, appears, that, the, final, breakthrough, of, paper, depended, just, as, much, on, the, rapid, spread, of, movable, type, printing, codices, of, parchment, which, in, terms, of, quality, is, superior, to, any, other, writing, material, still, had, a, substantial, share, in, gutenberg, s, edition, of, the, 42, line, bible, after, much, experimentation, gutenberg, managed, to, overcome, the, difficulties, which, traditional, water, based, inks, caused, by, soaking, the, paper, and, found, the, formula, for, an, oil, based, ink, suitable, for, high, quality, printing, with, metal, type, a, printing, press, in, its, classical, form, is, a, standing, mechanism, ranging, from, 5, to, 7, feet, 1, 5, to, 2, 1, m, long, 3, feet, 0, 91, m, wide, and, 7, feet, 2, 1, m, tall, the, small, individual, metal, letters, known, as, type, would, be, set, up, by, a, compositor, into, the, desired, lines, of, text, several, lines, of, text, would, be, arranged, at, once, and, were, placed, in, a, wooden, frame, known, as, a, galley, once, the, correct, number, of, pages, were, composed, the, galleys, would, be, laid, face, up, in, a, frame, also, known, as, a, forme, which, itself, is, placed, onto, a, flat, stone, bed, or, coffin, the, text, is, inked, using, two, balls, pads, mounted, on, handles, the, balls, were, made, of, dog, skin, leather, because, it, has, no, pores, and, stuffed, with, sheep, s, wool, and, were, inked, this, ink, was, then, applied, to, the, text, evenly, one, damp, piece, of, paper, was, then, taken, from, a, heap, of, paper, and, placed, on, the, tympan, the, paper, was, damp, as, this, lets, the, type, bite, into, the, paper, better, small, pins, hold, the, paper, in, place, the, paper, is, now, held, between, a, frisket, and, tympan, two, frames, covered, with, paper, or, parchment, these, are, folded, down, so, that, the, paper, lies, on, the, surface, of, the, inked, type, the, bed, is, rolled, under, the, platen, using, a, windlass, mechanism, a, small, rotating, handle, called, the, rounce, is, used, to, do, this, and, the, impression, is, made, with, a, screw, that, transmits, pressure, through, the, platen, to, turn, the, screw, the, long, handle, attached, to, it, is, turned, this, is, known, as, the, bar, or, devil, s, tail, in, a, well, set, up, press, the, springiness, of, the, paper, frisket, and, tympan, caused, the, bar, to, spring, back, and, raise, the, platen, the, windlass, turned, again, to, move, the, bed, back, to, its, original, position, the, tympan, and, frisket, raised, and, opened, and, the, printed, sheet, removed, such, presses, were, always, worked, by, hand, after, around, 1800, iron, presses, were, developed, some, of, which, could, be, operated, by, steam, power, the, function, of, the, printing, press, was, described, by, william, skeen, in, 1872, this, sketch, represents, a, press, in, its, completed, form, with, tympans, attached, to, the, end, of, the, carriage, and, with, the, frisket, above, the, tympans, the, tympans, inner, and, outer, are, thin, iron, frames, one, fitting, into, the, other, on, each, of, which, is, stretched, a, skin, of, parchment, or, a, breadth, of, fine, cloth, a, woollen, blanket, or, two, with, a, few, sheets, of, paper, are, placed, between, these, the, whole, thus, forming, a, thin, elastic, pad, on, which, the, sheet, to, be, printed, is, laid, the, frisket, is, a, slender, frame, work, covered, with, coarse, paper, on, which, an, impression, is, first, taken, the, whole, of, the, printed, part, is, then, cut, out, leaving, apertures, exactly, corresponding, with, the, pages, of, type, on, the, carriage, of, the, press, the, frisket, when, folded, on, to, the, tympans, and, both, turned, down, over, the, forme, of, types, and, run, in, under, the, platten, preserves, the, sheet, from, contact, with, any, thing, but, the, inked, surface, of, the, types, when, the, pull, which, brings, down, the, screw, and, forces, the, platten, to, produce, the, impression, is, made, by, the, pressman, who, works, the, lever, to, whom, is, facetiously, given, the, title, of, the, practitioner, at, the, bar, johannes, gutenberg, s, work, on, the, printing, press, began, in, approximately, 1436, when, he, partnered, with, andreas, dritzehn, a, man, who, had, previously, instructed, in, gem, cutting, and, andreas, heilmann, owner, of, a, paper, mill, however, it, was, not, until, a, 1439, lawsuit, against, gutenberg, that, an, official, record, existed, witnesses, testimony, discussed, gutenberg, s, types, an, inventory, of, metals, including, lead, and, his, type, molds, having, previously, worked, as, a, professional, goldsmith, gutenberg, made, skillful, use, of, the, knowledge, of, metals, he, had, learned, as, a, craftsman, he, was, the, first, to, make, type, from, an, alloy, of, lead, tin, and, antimony, which, was, critical, for, producing, durable, type, that, produced, high, quality, printed, books, and, proved, to, be, much, better, suited, for, printing, than, all, other, known, materials, to, create, these, lead, types, gutenberg, used, what, is, considered, one, of, his, most, ingenious, inventions, a, special, matrix, enabling, the, quick, and, precise, molding, of, new, type, blocks, from, a, uniform, template, his, type, case, is, estimated, to, have, contained, around, 290, separate, letter, boxes, most, of, which, were, required, for, special, characters, ligatures, punctuation, marks, and, so, forth, gutenberg, is, also, credited, with, the, introduction, of, an, oil, based, ink, which, was, more, durable, than, the, previously, used, water, based, inks, as, printing, material, he, used, both, paper, and, vellum, high, quality, parchment, in, the, gutenberg, bible, gutenberg, made, a, trial, of, colour, printing, for, a, few, of, the, page, headings, present, only, in, some, copies, a, later, work, the, mainz, psalter, of, 1453, presumably, designed, by, gutenberg, but, published, under, the, imprint, of, his, successors, johann, fust, and, peter, sch, ffer, had, elaborate, red, and, blue, printed, initials, the, printing, revolution, occurred, when, the, spread, of, the, printing, press, facilitated, the, wide, circulation, of, information, and, ideas, acting, as, an, agent, of, change, through, the, societies, that, it, reached, demand, for, bibles, and, other, religious, literature, was, one, of, the, main, drivers, of, the, very, rapid, initial, expansion, of, printing, much, later, printed, literature, played, a, major, role, in, rallying, support, and, opposition, during, the, lead, up, to, the, english, civil, war, and, later, still, the, american, and, french, revolutions, through, newspapers, pamphlets, and, bulletins, the, advent, of, the, printing, press, brought, with, it, issues, involving, censorship, and, freedom, of, the, press, the, invention, of, mechanical, movable, type, printing, led, to, a, huge, increase, of, printing, activities, across, europe, within, only, a, few, decades, from, a, single, print, shop, in, mainz, germany, printing, had, spread, to, no, less, than, around, 270, cities, in, central, western, and, eastern, europe, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, as, early, as, 1480, there, were, printers, active, in, 110, different, places, in, germany, italy, france, spain, the, netherlands, belgium, switzerland, england, bohemia, and, poland, from, that, time, on, it, is, assumed, that, the, printed, book, was, in, universal, use, in, europe, in, italy, a, center, of, early, printing, print, shops, had, been, established, in, 77, cities, and, towns, by, 1500, at, the, end, of, the, following, century, 151, locations, in, italy, had, seen, at, one, time, printing, activities, with, a, total, of, nearly, three, thousand, printers, known, to, be, active, despite, this, proliferation, printing, centres, soon, emerged, thus, one, third, of, the, italian, printers, published, in, venice, by, 1500, the, printing, presses, in, operation, throughout, western, europe, had, already, produced, more, than, twenty, million, copies, in, the, following, century, their, output, rose, tenfold, to, an, estimated, 150, to, 200, million, copies, european, printing, presses, of, around, 1600, were, capable, of, producing, between, 1, 500, and, 3, 600, impressions, per, workday, by, comparison, far, eastern, printing, where, the, back, of, the, paper, was, manually, rubbed, to, the, page, did, not, exceed, an, output, of, forty, pages, per, day, of, erasmus, s, work, at, least, 750, 000, copies, were, sold, during, his, lifetime, alone, 1469, 1536, in, the, early, days, of, the, reformation, the, revolutionary, potential, of, bulk, printing, took, princes, and, papacy, alike, by, surprise, in, the, period, from, 1518, to, 1524, the, publication, of, books, in, germany, alone, skyrocketed, sevenfold, between, 1518, and, 1520, luther, s, tracts, were, distributed, in, 300, 000, printed, copies, the, rapidity, of, typographical, text, production, as, well, as, the, sharp, fall, in, unit, costs, led, to, the, issuing, of, the, first, newspapers, see, relation, which, opened, up, an, entirely, new, field, for, conveying, up, to, date, information, to, the, public, incunable, are, surviving, pre, 16th, century, print, works, which, are, collected, by, many, of, the, libraries, in, europe, and, north, america, the, printing, press, was, also, a, factor, in, the, establishment, of, a, community, of, scientists, who, could, easily, communicate, their, discoveries, through, the, establishment, of, widely, disseminated, scholarly, journals, helping, to, bring, on, the, scientific, revolution, because, of, the, printing, press, authorship, became, more, meaningful, and, profitable, it, was, suddenly, important, who, had, said, or, written, what, and, what, the, precise, formulation, and, time, of, composition, was, this, allowed, the, exact, citing, of, references, producing, the, rule, one, author, one, work, title, one, piece, of, information, giesecke, 1989, 325, before, the, author, was, less, important, since, a, copy, of, aristotle, made, in, paris, would, not, be, exactly, identical, to, one, made, in, bologna, for, many, works, prior, to, the, printing, press, the, name, of, the, author, has, been, entirely, lost, because, the, printing, process, ensured, that, the, same, information, fell, on, the, same, pages, page, numbering, tables, of, contents, and, indices, became, common, though, they, previously, had, not, been, unknown, the, process, of, reading, also, changed, gradually, moving, over, several, centuries, from, oral, readings, to, silent, private, reading, over, the, next, 200, years, the, wider, availability, of, printed, materials, led, to, a, dramatic, rise, in, the, adult, literacy, rate, throughout, europe, the, printing, press, was, an, important, step, towards, the, democratization, of, knowledge, within, 50, or, 60, years, of, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, the, entire, classical, canon, had, been, reprinted, and, widely, promulgated, throughout, europe, eisenstein, 1969, 52, more, people, had, access, to, knowledge, both, new, and, old, more, people, could, discuss, these, works, book, production, became, more, commercialised, and, the, first, copyright, laws, were, passed, on, the, other, hand, the, printing, press, was, criticized, for, allowing, the, dissemination, of, information, that, may, have, been, incorrect, a, second, outgrowth, of, this, popularization, of, knowledge, was, the, decline, of, latin, as, the, language, of, most, published, works, to, be, replaced, by, the, vernacular, language, of, each, area, increasing, the, variety, of, published, works, the, printed, word, also, helped, to, unify, and, standardize, the, spelling, and, syntax, of, these, vernaculars, in, effect, decreasing, their, variability, this, rise, in, importance, of, national, languages, as, opposed, to, pan, european, latin, is, cited, as, one, of, the, causes, of, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, europe, a, third, consequence, of, popularization, of, printing, was, on, the, economy, the, printing, press, was, associated, with, higher, levels, of, city, growth, the, publication, of, trade, related, manuals, and, books, teaching, techniques, like, double, entry, bookkeeping, increased, the, reliability, of, trade, and, led, to, the, decline, of, merchant, guilds, and, the, rise, of, individual, traders, at, the, dawn, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, mechanics, of, the, hand, operated, gutenberg, style, press, were, still, essentially, unchanged, although, new, materials, in, its, construction, amongst, other, innovations, had, gradually, improved, its, printing, efficiency, by, 1800, lord, stanhope, had, built, a, press, completely, from, cast, iron, which, reduced, the, force, required, by, 90, while, doubling, the, size, of, the, printed, area, with, a, capacity, of, 480, pages, per, hour, the, stanhope, press, doubled, the, output, of, the, old, style, press, nonetheless, the, limitations, inherent, to, the, traditional, method, of, printing, became, obvious, two, ideas, altered, the, design, of, the, printing, press, radically, first, the, use, of, steam, power, for, running, the, machinery, and, second, the, replacement, of, the, printing, flatbed, with, the, rotary, motion, of, cylinders, both, elements, were, for, the, first, time, successfully, implemented, by, the, german, printer, friedrich, koenig, in, a, series, of, press, designs, devised, between, 1802, and, 1818, having, moved, to, london, in, 1804, koenig, soon, met, thomas, bensley, and, secured, financial, support, for, his, project, in, 1807, patented, in, 1810, koenig, had, designed, a, steam, press, much, like, a, hand, press, connected, to, a, steam, engine, the, first, production, trial, of, this, model, occurred, in, april, 1811, he, produced, his, machine, with, assistance, from, german, engineer, andreas, friedrich, bauer, koenig, and, bauer, sold, two, of, their, first, models, to, the, times, in, london, in, 1814, capable, of, 1, 100, impressions, per, hour, the, first, edition, so, printed, was, on, 28, november, 1814, they, went, on, to, perfect, the, early, model, so, that, it, could, print, on, both, sides, of, a, sheet, at, once, this, began, the, long, process, of, making, newspapers, available, to, a, mass, audience, which, in, turn, helped, spread, literacy, and, from, the, 1820s, changed, the, nature, of, book, production, forcing, a, greater, standardization, in, titles, and, other, metadata, their, company, koenig, bauer, ag, is, still, one, of, the, world, s, largest, manufacturers, of, printing, presses, today, the, steam, powered, rotary, printing, press, invented, in, 1843, in, the, united, states, by, richard, m, hoe, ultimately, allowed, millions, of, copies, of, a, page, in, a, single, day, mass, production, of, printed, works, flourished, after, the, transition, to, rolled, paper, as, continuous, feed, allowed, the, presses, to, run, at, a, much, faster, pace, hoe, s, original, design, operated, at, up, to, 2, 000, revolutions, per, hour, where, each, revolution, deposited, 4, page, images, giving, the, press, a, throughput, of, 8, 000, pages, per, hour, by, 1891, the, new, york, world, and, philadelphia, item, were, operating, presses, producing, either, 90, 000, 4, page, sheets, per, hour, or, 48, 000, 8, page, sheets, also, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, there, was, a, separate, development, of, jobbing, presses, small, presses, capable, of, printing, small, format, pieces, such, as, billheads, letterheads, business, cards, and, envelopes, jobbing, presses, were, capable, of, quick, setup, average, setup, time, for, a, small, job, was, under, 15, minutes, and, quick, production, even, on, treadle, powered, jobbing, presses, it, was, considered, normal, to, get, 1, 000, impressions, per, hour,
