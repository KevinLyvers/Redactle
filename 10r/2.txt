aquaculture, less, commonly, spelled, aquiculture, also, known, as, aquafarming, is, the, controlled, cultivation, farming, of, aquatic, organisms, such, as, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae, and, other, organisms, of, value, such, as, aquatic, plants, e, g, lotus, aquaculture, involves, cultivating, freshwater, brackish, water, and, saltwater, populations, under, controlled, or, semi, natural, conditions, and, can, be, contrasted, with, commercial, fishing, which, is, the, harvesting, of, wild, fish, aquaculture, is, also, a, practice, used, for, restoring, and, rehabilitating, marine, and, freshwater, ecosystems, mariculture, commonly, known, as, marine, farming, is, aquaculture, in, seawater, habitats, and, lagoons, as, opposed, to, freshwater, aquaculture, pisciculture, is, a, type, of, aquaculture, that, consists, of, fish, farming, to, obtain, fish, products, as, food, aquaculture, can, also, be, defined, as, the, breeding, growing, and, harvesting, of, fish, and, other, aquatic, plants, also, known, as, farming, in, water, it, is, an, environmental, source, of, food, and, commercial, products, that, help, to, improve, healthier, habitats, and, are, used, to, reconstruct, the, population, of, endangered, aquatic, species, technology, has, increased, the, growth, of, fish, in, coastal, marine, waters, and, open, oceans, due, to, the, increased, demand, for, seafood, aquaculture, can, be, conducted, in, completely, artificial, facilities, built, on, land, onshore, aquaculture, as, in, the, case, of, fish, tank, ponds, aquaponics, or, raceways, where, the, living, conditions, rely, on, human, control, such, as, water, quality, oxygen, feed, temperature, alternatively, they, can, be, conducted, on, well, sheltered, shallow, waters, nearshore, of, a, body, of, water, inshore, aquaculture, where, the, cultivated, species, are, subjected, to, relatively, more, naturalistic, environments, or, on, fenced, enclosed, sections, of, open, water, away, from, the, shore, offshore, aquaculture, where, the, species, are, either, cultured, in, cages, racks, or, bags, and, are, exposed, to, more, diverse, natural, conditions, such, as, water, currents, such, as, ocean, currents, diel, vertical, migration, and, nutrient, cycles, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, aquaculture, is, understood, to, mean, the, farming, of, aquatic, organisms, including, fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and, aquatic, plants, farming, implies, some, form, of, intervention, in, the, rearing, process, to, enhance, production, such, as, regular, stocking, feeding, protection, from, predators, etc, farming, also, implies, individual, or, corporate, ownership, of, the, stock, being, cultivated, the, reported, output, from, global, aquaculture, operations, in, 2019, was, over, 120, million, tonnes, valued, at, us, 274, billion, however, there, are, issues, with, the, reliability, of, the, reported, figures, further, in, current, aquaculture, practice, products, from, several, kilograms, of, wild, fish, are, used, to, produce, one, kilogram, of, a, piscivorous, fish, like, salmon, plant, and, insect, based, feeds, are, also, being, developed, to, help, reduce, wild, fish, been, used, for, aquaculture, feed, particular, kinds, of, aquaculture, include, fish, farming, shrimp, farming, oyster, farming, mariculture, pisciculture, algaculture, such, as, seaweed, farming, and, the, cultivation, of, ornamental, fish, particular, methods, include, aquaponics, and, integrated, multi, trophic, aquaculture, both, of, which, integrate, fish, farming, and, aquatic, plant, farming, the, fao, describes, aquaculture, as, one, of, the, industries, most, directly, affected, by, climate, change, and, its, impacts, some, forms, of, aquaculture, have, negative, impacts, on, the, environment, such, as, through, nutrient, pollution, or, disease, transfer, to, wild, populations, harvest, stagnation, in, wild, fisheries, and, overexploitation, of, popular, marine, species, combined, with, a, growing, demand, for, high, quality, protein, encouraged, aquaculturists, to, domesticate, other, marine, species, at, the, outset, of, modern, aquaculture, many, were, optimistic, that, a, blue, revolution, could, take, place, in, aquaculture, just, as, the, green, revolution, of, the, 20th, century, had, revolutionized, agriculture, although, land, animals, had, long, been, domesticated, most, seafood, species, were, still, caught, from, the, wild, concerned, about, the, impact, of, growing, demand, for, seafood, on, the, world, s, oceans, prominent, ocean, explorer, jacques, cousteau, wrote, in, 1973, with, earth, s, burgeoning, human, populations, to, feed, we, must, turn, to, the, sea, with, new, understanding, and, new, technology, about, 430, 97, of, the, species, cultured, as, of, 2007, were, domesticated, during, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, of, which, an, estimated, 106, came, in, the, decade, to, 2007, given, the, long, term, importance, of, agriculture, to, date, only, 0, 08, of, known, land, plant, species, and, 0, 0002, of, known, land, animal, species, have, been, domesticated, compared, with, 0, 17, of, known, marine, plant, species, and, 0, 13, of, known, marine, animal, species, domestication, typically, involves, about, a, decade, of, scientific, research, domesticating, aquatic, species, involves, fewer, risks, to, humans, than, do, land, animals, which, took, a, large, toll, in, human, lives, most, major, human, diseases, originated, in, domesticated, animals, including, diseases, such, as, smallpox, and, diphtheria, that, like, most, infectious, diseases, move, to, humans, from, animals, no, human, pathogens, of, comparable, virulence, have, yet, emerged, from, marine, species, biological, control, methods, to, manage, parasites, are, already, being, used, such, as, cleaner, fish, e, g, lumpsuckers, and, wrasse, to, control, sea, lice, populations, in, salmon, farming, models, are, being, used, to, help, with, spatial, planning, and, siting, of, fish, farms, in, order, to, minimize, impact, the, decline, in, wild, fish, stocks, has, increased, the, demand, for, farmed, fish, however, finding, alternative, sources, of, protein, and, oil, for, fish, feed, is, necessary, so, the, aquaculture, industry, can, grow, sustainably, otherwise, it, represents, a, great, risk, for, the, over, exploitation, of, forage, fish, aquaculture, production, now, exceeds, capture, fishery, production, and, together, the, relative, gdp, contribution, has, ranged, from, 0, 01, to, 10, singling, out, aquaculture, s, relative, contribution, to, gdp, however, is, not, easily, derived, due, to, lack, of, data, another, recent, issue, following, the, banning, in, 2008, of, organotins, by, the, international, maritime, organization, is, the, need, to, find, environmentally, friendly, but, still, effective, compounds, with, antifouling, effects, many, new, natural, compounds, are, discovered, every, year, but, producing, them, on, a, large, enough, scale, for, commercial, purposes, is, almost, impossible, it, is, highly, probable, that, future, developments, in, this, field, will, rely, on, microorganisms, but, greater, funding, and, further, research, is, needed, to, overcome, the, lack, of, knowledge, in, this, field, microalgae, also, referred, to, as, phytoplankton, microphytes, or, planktonic, algae, constitute, the, majority, of, cultivated, algae, macroalgae, commonly, known, as, seaweed, also, have, many, commercial, and, industrial, uses, but, due, to, their, size, and, specific, requirements, they, are, not, easily, cultivated, on, a, large, scale, and, are, most, often, taken, in, the, wild, in, 2016, aquaculture, was, the, source, of, 96, 5, percent, by, volume, of, the, total, 31, 2, million, tonnes, of, wild, collected, and, cultivated, aquatic, plants, combined, global, production, of, farmed, aquatic, plants, overwhelmingly, dominated, by, seaweeds, grew, in, output, volume, from, 13, 5, million, tonnes, in, 1995, to, just, over, 30, million, tonnes, in, 2016, seaweed, farming, or, kelp, farming, is, the, practice, of, cultivating, and, harvesting, seaweed, in, its, simplest, form, farmers, gather, from, natural, beds, while, at, the, other, extreme, farmers, fully, control, the, crop, s, life, cycle, the, seven, most, cultivated, taxa, are, eucheuma, spp, kappaphycus, alvarezii, gracilaria, spp, saccharina, japonica, undaria, pinnatifida, pyropia, spp, and, sargassum, fusiforme, eucheuma, and, k, alvarezii, are, attractive, for, carrageenan, a, gelling, agent, gracilaria, is, farmed, for, agar, the, rest, are, eaten, after, limited, processing, seaweeds, are, different, from, mangroves, and, seagrasses, as, they, are, photosynthetic, algal, organisms, and, are, non, flowering, the, largest, seaweed, producing, countries, as, of, 2022, are, china, 58, 62, and, indonesia, 28, 6, followed, by, south, korea, 5, 09, and, the, philippines, 4, 19, other, notable, producers, include, north, korea, 1, 6, japan, 1, 15, malaysia, 0, 53, zanzibar, tanzania, 0, 5, and, chile, 0, 3, seaweed, farming, has, frequently, been, developed, to, improve, economic, conditions, and, to, reduce, fishing, pressure, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, reported, that, world, production, in, 2019, was, over, 35, million, tonnes, north, america, produced, some, 23, 000, tonnes, of, wet, seaweed, alaska, maine, france, and, norway, each, more, than, doubled, their, seaweed, production, since, 2018, as, of, 2019, seaweed, represented, 30, of, marine, aquaculture, the, farming, of, fish, is, the, most, common, form, of, aquaculture, it, involves, raising, fish, commercially, in, tanks, fish, ponds, or, ocean, enclosures, usually, for, food, a, facility, that, releases, juvenile, fish, into, the, wild, for, recreational, fishing, or, to, supplement, a, species, natural, numbers, is, generally, referred, to, as, a, fish, hatchery, worldwide, the, most, important, fish, species, used, in, fish, farming, are, in, order, carp, salmon, tilapia, and, catfish, in, the, mediterranean, young, bluefin, tuna, are, netted, at, sea, and, towed, slowly, towards, the, shore, they, are, then, interned, in, offshore, pens, sometimes, made, from, floating, hdpe, pipe, where, they, are, further, grown, for, the, market, in, 2009, researchers, in, australia, managed, for, the, first, time, to, coax, southern, bluefin, tuna, to, breed, in, landlocked, tanks, southern, bluefin, tuna, are, also, caught, in, the, wild, and, fattened, in, grow, out, sea, cages, in, southern, spencer, gulf, south, australia, a, similar, process, is, used, in, the, salmon, farming, section, of, this, industry, juveniles, are, taken, from, hatcheries, and, a, variety, of, methods, are, used, to, aid, them, in, their, maturation, for, example, as, stated, above, some, of, the, most, important, fish, species, in, the, industry, salmon, can, be, grown, using, a, cage, system, this, is, done, by, having, netted, cages, preferably, in, open, water, that, has, a, strong, flow, and, feeding, the, salmon, a, special, food, mixture, that, aids, their, growth, this, process, allows, for, year, round, growth, of, the, fish, thus, a, higher, harvest, during, the, correct, seasons, an, additional, method, known, sometimes, as, sea, ranching, has, also, been, used, within, the, industry, sea, ranching, involves, raising, fish, in, a, hatchery, for, a, brief, time, and, then, releasing, them, into, marine, waters, for, further, development, whereupon, the, fish, are, recaptured, when, they, have, matured, commercial, shrimp, farming, began, in, the, 1970s, and, production, grew, steeply, thereafter, global, production, reached, more, than, 1, 6, million, tonnes, in, 2003, worth, about, us, 9, billion, about, 75, of, farmed, shrimp, is, produced, in, asia, in, particular, in, china, and, thailand, the, other, 25, is, produced, mainly, in, latin, america, where, brazil, is, the, largest, producer, thailand, is, the, largest, exporter, shrimp, farming, has, changed, from, its, traditional, small, scale, form, in, southeast, asia, into, a, global, industry, technological, advances, have, led, to, ever, higher, densities, per, unit, area, and, broodstock, is, shipped, worldwide, virtually, all, farmed, shrimp, are, penaeids, i, e, shrimp, of, the, family, penaeidae, and, just, two, species, of, shrimp, the, pacific, white, shrimp, and, the, giant, tiger, prawn, account, for, about, 80, of, all, farmed, shrimp, these, industrial, monocultures, are, very, susceptible, to, disease, which, has, decimated, shrimp, populations, across, entire, regions, increasing, ecological, problems, repeated, disease, outbreaks, and, pressure, and, criticism, from, both, nongovernmental, organizations, and, consumer, countries, led, to, changes, in, the, industry, in, the, late, 1990s, and, generally, stronger, regulations, in, 1999, governments, industry, representatives, and, environmental, organizations, initiated, a, program, aimed, at, developing, and, promoting, more, sustainable, farming, practices, through, the, seafood, watch, program, freshwater, prawn, farming, shares, many, characteristics, with, including, many, problems, with, marine, shrimp, farming, unique, problems, are, introduced, by, the, developmental, lifecycle, of, the, main, species, the, giant, river, prawn, the, global, annual, production, of, freshwater, prawns, excluding, crayfish, and, crabs, in, 2007, was, about, 460, 000, tonnes, exceeding, 1, 86, billion, dollars, additionally, china, produced, about, 370, 000, tonnes, of, chinese, river, crab, in, addition, astaciculture, is, the, freshwater, farming, of, crayfish, mostly, in, the, us, australia, and, europe, aquacultured, shellfish, include, various, oyster, mussel, and, clam, species, these, bivalves, are, filter, and, or, deposit, feeders, which, rely, on, ambient, primary, production, rather, than, inputs, of, fish, or, other, feed, as, such, shellfish, aquaculture, is, generally, perceived, as, benign, or, even, beneficial, depending, on, the, species, and, local, conditions, bivalve, molluscs, are, either, grown, on, the, beach, on, longlines, or, suspended, from, rafts, and, harvested, by, hand, or, by, dredging, in, may, 2017, a, belgian, consortium, installed, the, first, of, two, trial, mussel, farms, on, a, wind, farm, in, the, north, sea, abalone, farming, began, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, in, japan, and, china, since, the, mid, 1990s, this, industry, has, become, increasingly, successful, overfishing, and, poaching, have, reduced, wild, populations, to, the, extent, that, farmed, abalone, now, supplies, most, abalone, meat, sustainably, farmed, molluscs, can, be, certified, by, seafood, watch, and, other, organizations, including, the, world, wildlife, fund, wwf, wwf, initiated, the, aquaculture, dialogues, in, 2004, to, develop, measurable, and, performance, based, standards, for, responsibly, farmed, seafood, in, 2009, wwf, co, founded, the, aquaculture, stewardship, council, with, the, dutch, sustainable, trade, initiative, to, manage, the, global, standards, and, certification, programs, after, trials, in, 2012, a, commercial, sea, ranch, was, set, up, in, flinders, bay, western, australia, to, raise, abalone, the, ranch, is, based, on, an, artificial, reef, made, up, of, 5000, as, of, april, 2016, separate, concrete, units, called, abitats, abalone, habitats, the, 900, kg, abitats, can, host, 400, abalone, each, the, reef, is, seeded, with, young, abalone, from, an, onshore, hatchery, the, abalone, feed, on, seaweed, that, has, grown, naturally, on, the, habitats, with, the, ecosystem, enrichment, of, the, bay, also, resulting, in, growing, numbers, of, dhufish, pink, snapper, wrasse, and, samson, fish, among, other, species, brad, adams, from, the, company, has, emphasised, the, similarity, to, wild, abalone, and, the, difference, from, shore, based, aquaculture, we, re, not, aquaculture, we, re, ranching, because, once, they, re, in, the, water, they, look, after, themselves, other, groups, include, aquatic, reptiles, amphibians, and, miscellaneous, invertebrates, such, as, echinoderms, and, jellyfish, they, are, separately, graphed, at, the, top, right, of, this, section, since, they, do, not, contribute, enough, volume, to, show, clearly, on, the, main, graph, commercially, harvested, echinoderms, include, sea, cucumbers, and, sea, urchins, in, china, sea, cucumbers, are, farmed, in, artificial, ponds, as, large, as, 400, hectares, 1, 000, acres, global, fish, production, peaked, at, about, 171, million, tonnes, in, 2016, with, aquaculture, representing, 47, percent, of, the, total, and, 53, percent, if, non, food, uses, including, reduction, to, fishmeal, and, fish, oil, are, excluded, with, capture, fishery, production, relatively, static, since, the, late, 1980s, aquaculture, has, been, responsible, for, the, continuing, growth, in, the, supply, of, fish, for, human, consumption, global, aquaculture, production, including, aquatic, plants, in, 2016, was, 110, 2, million, tonnes, with, the, first, sale, value, estimated, at, us, 244, billion, three, years, later, in, 2019, the, reported, output, from, global, aquaculture, operations, was, over, 120, million, tonnes, valued, at, us, 274, billion, the, contribution, of, aquaculture, to, the, global, production, of, capture, fisheries, and, aquaculture, combined, has, risen, continuously, reaching, 46, 8, percent, in, 2016, up, from, 25, 7, percent, in, 2000, with, 5, 8, percent, annual, growth, rate, during, the, period, 2001, 2016, aquaculture, continues, to, grow, faster, than, other, major, food, production, sectors, but, it, no, longer, has, the, high, annual, growth, rates, experienced, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, 2012, the, total, world, production, of, fisheries, was, 158, million, tonnes, of, which, aquaculture, contributed, 66, 6, million, tonnes, about, 42, the, growth, rate, of, worldwide, aquaculture, has, been, sustained, and, rapid, averaging, about, 8, per, year, for, over, 30, years, while, the, take, from, wild, fisheries, has, been, essentially, flat, for, the, last, decade, the, aquaculture, market, reached, 86, billion, in, 2009, aquaculture, is, an, especially, important, economic, activity, in, china, between, 1980, and, 1997, the, chinese, bureau, of, fisheries, reports, aquaculture, harvests, grew, at, an, annual, rate, of, 16, 7, jumping, from, 1, 9, million, tonnes, to, nearly, 23, million, tonnes, in, 2005, china, accounted, for, 70, of, world, production, aquaculture, is, also, currently, one, of, the, fastest, growing, areas, of, food, production, in, the, u, s, about, 90, of, all, u, s, shrimp, consumption, is, farmed, and, imported, in, recent, years, salmon, aquaculture, has, become, a, major, export, in, southern, chile, especially, in, puerto, montt, chile, s, fastest, growing, city, a, united, nations, report, titled, the, state, of, the, world, fisheries, and, aquaculture, released, in, may, 2014, maintained, fisheries, and, aquaculture, support, the, livelihoods, of, some, 60, million, people, in, asia, and, africa, fao, estimates, that, in, 2016, overall, women, accounted, for, nearly, 14, percent, of, all, people, directly, engaged, in, the, fisheries, and, aquaculture, primary, sector, in, 2021, global, fish, production, reached, 182, million, tonnes, with, approximately, equal, amounts, coming, from, capture, 91, 2, million, tonnes, and, aquaculture, 90, 9, million, tonnes, aquaculture, has, experienced, rapid, growth, in, recent, decades, increasing, almost, sevenfold, from, 1990, to, 2021, china, overwhelmingly, dominates, the, world, in, reported, aquaculture, output, reporting, a, total, output, which, is, double, that, of, the, rest, of, the, world, put, together, however, there, are, some, historical, issues, with, the, accuracy, of, china, s, returns, in, 2001, scientists, reg, watson, and, daniel, pauly, expressed, concerns, that, china, was, over, reporting, its, catch, from, wild, fisheries, in, the, 1990s, they, said, that, made, it, appear, that, the, global, catch, since, 1988, was, increasing, annually, by, 300, 000, tonnes, whereas, it, was, really, shrinking, annually, by, 350, 000, tonnes, watson, and, pauly, suggested, this, may, have, been, related, to, chinese, policies, where, state, entities, that, monitored, the, economy, were, also, tasked, with, increasing, output, also, until, more, recently, the, promotion, of, chinese, officials, was, based, on, production, increases, from, their, own, areas, china, disputed, this, claim, the, official, xinhua, news, agency, quoted, yang, jian, director, general, of, the, agriculture, ministry, s, bureau, of, fisheries, as, saying, that, china, s, figures, were, basically, correct, however, the, fao, accepted, there, were, issues, with, the, reliability, of, china, s, statistical, returns, and, for, a, period, treated, data, from, china, including, the, aquaculture, data, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, world, mariculture, is, the, cultivation, of, marine, organisms, in, seawater, variously, in, sheltered, coastal, waters, inshore, open, ocean, offshore, and, on, land, onshore, farmed, species, include, algae, from, microalgae, such, as, phytoplankton, to, macroalgae, such, as, seaweed, shellfish, such, as, shrimp, lobster, oysters, and, clams, and, marine, finfish, channel, catfish, ictalurus, punctatus, hard, clams, mercenaria, mercenaria, and, atlantic, salmon, salmo, salar, are, prominent, in, the, u, s, mariculture, mariculture, may, consist, of, raising, the, organisms, on, or, in, artificial, enclosures, such, as, in, floating, netted, enclosures, for, salmon, and, on, racks, or, in, floating, cages, for, oysters, in, the, case, of, enclosed, salmon, they, are, fed, by, the, operators, oysters, on, racks, filter, feed, on, naturally, available, food, abalone, have, been, farmed, on, an, artificial, reef, consuming, seaweed, which, grows, naturally, on, the, reef, units, integrated, multi, trophic, aquaculture, imta, is, a, practice, in, which, the, byproducts, wastes, from, one, species, are, recycled, to, become, inputs, fertilizers, food, for, another, fed, aquaculture, for, example, fish, shrimp, is, combined, with, inorganic, extractive, and, organic, extractive, for, example, shellfish, aquaculture, to, create, balanced, systems, for, environmental, sustainability, biomitigation, economic, stability, product, diversification, and, risk, reduction, and, social, acceptability, better, management, practices, multi, trophic, refers, to, the, incorporation, of, species, from, different, trophic, or, nutritional, levels, in, the, same, system, this, is, one, potential, distinction, from, the, age, old, practice, of, aquatic, polyculture, which, could, simply, be, the, co, culture, of, different, fish, species, from, the, same, trophic, level, in, this, case, these, organisms, may, all, share, the, same, biological, and, chemical, processes, with, few, synergistic, benefits, which, could, potentially, lead, to, significant, shifts, in, the, ecosystem, some, traditional, polyculture, systems, may, in, fact, incorporate, a, greater, diversity, of, species, occupying, several, niches, as, extensive, cultures, low, intensity, low, management, within, the, same, pond, a, working, imta, system, can, result, in, greater, total, production, based, on, mutual, benefits, to, the, co, cultured, species, and, improved, ecosystem, health, even, if, the, production, of, individual, species, is, lower, than, in, a, monoculture, over, a, short, term, period, sometimes, the, term, integrated, aquaculture, is, used, to, describe, the, integration, of, monocultures, through, water, transfer, for, all, intents, and, purposes, however, the, terms, imta, and, integrated, aquaculture, differ, only, in, their, degree, of, descriptiveness, aquaponics, fractionated, aquaculture, integrated, agriculture, aquaculture, systems, integrated, peri, urban, aquaculture, systems, and, integrated, fisheries, aquaculture, systems, are, other, variations, of, the, imta, concept, various, materials, including, nylon, polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, plastic, coated, welded, wire, rubber, patented, rope, products, spectra, thorn, d, dyneema, galvanized, steel, and, copper, are, used, for, netting, in, aquaculture, fish, enclosures, around, the, world, all, of, these, materials, are, selected, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, design, feasibility, material, strength, cost, and, corrosion, resistance, recently, copper, alloys, have, become, important, netting, materials, in, aquaculture, because, they, are, antimicrobial, i, e, they, destroy, bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and, other, microbes, and, they, therefore, prevent, biofouling, i, e, the, undesirable, accumulation, adhesion, and, growth, of, microorganisms, plants, algae, tubeworms, barnacles, mollusks, and, other, organisms, by, inhibiting, microbial, growth, copper, alloy, aquaculture, cages, avoid, costly, net, changes, that, are, necessary, with, other, materials, the, resistance, of, organism, growth, on, copper, alloy, nets, also, provides, a, cleaner, and, healthier, environment, for, farmed, fish, to, grow, and, thrive, uncrewed, vessels, like, rovs, and, auvs, are, now, being, used, in, aquaculture, in, various, ways, such, as, site, planning, cage, or, net, inspection, environmental, monitoring, disaster, assessment, and, risk, reduction, the, use, of, uncrewed, vessels, aims, to, increase, safety, efficiency, and, accuracy, of, aquaculture, operations, aquaculture, is, a, multi, million, dollar, business, that, relies, on, net, and, cage, maintenance, inspections, used, to, be, conducted, by, divers, manually, inspecting, the, nets, but, uncrewed, vessels, are, now, being, used, to, conduct, faster, and, more, efficient, inspections, biofloc, technology, is, also, used, to, simultaneously, improve, water, quality, and, generate, bacterial, biomass, as, food, for, the, cultured, animals, if, performed, without, consideration, for, potential, local, environmental, impacts, aquaculture, in, inland, waters, can, result, in, more, environmental, damage, than, wild, fisheries, though, with, less, waste, produced, per, kg, on, a, global, scale, local, concerns, with, aquaculture, in, inland, waters, may, include, waste, handling, side, effects, of, antibiotics, competition, between, farmed, and, wild, animals, and, the, potential, introduction, of, invasive, plant, and, animal, species, or, foreign, pathogens, particularly, if, unprocessed, fish, are, used, to, feed, more, marketable, carnivorous, fish, if, non, local, live, feeds, are, used, aquaculture, may, introduce, exotic, plants, or, animals, with, disastrous, effects, improvements, in, methods, resulting, from, advances, in, research, and, the, availability, of, commercial, feeds, has, reduced, some, of, these, concerns, since, their, greater, prevalence, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, fish, waste, is, organic, and, composed, of, nutrients, necessary, in, all, components, of, aquatic, food, webs, in, ocean, aquaculture, often, produces, much, higher, than, normal, fish, waste, concentrations, the, waste, collects, on, the, ocean, bottom, damaging, or, eliminating, bottom, dwelling, life, waste, can, also, decrease, dissolved, oxygen, levels, in, the, water, column, putting, further, pressure, on, wild, animals, an, alternative, model, to, food, being, added, to, the, ecosystem, is, the, installation, of, artificial, reef, structures, to, increase, the, habitat, niches, available, without, the, need, to, add, any, more, than, ambient, feed, and, nutrient, this, has, been, used, in, the, ranching, of, abalone, in, western, australia, some, carnivorous, and, omnivorous, farmed, fish, species, are, fed, wild, forage, fish, although, carnivorous, farmed, fish, represented, only, 13, percent, of, aquaculture, production, by, weight, in, 2000, they, represented, 34, percent, of, aquaculture, production, by, value, farming, of, carnivorous, species, like, salmon, and, shrimp, leads, to, a, high, demand, for, forage, fish, to, match, the, nutrition, they, get, in, the, wild, fish, do, not, actually, produce, omega, 3, fatty, acids, but, instead, accumulate, them, from, either, consuming, microalgae, that, produce, these, fatty, acids, as, is, the, case, with, forage, fish, like, herring, and, sardines, or, as, is, the, case, with, fatty, predatory, fish, like, salmon, by, eating, prey, fish, that, have, accumulated, omega, 3, fatty, acids, from, microalgae, to, satisfy, this, requirement, more, than, 50, percent, of, the, world, fish, oil, production, is, fed, to, farmed, salmon, farmed, salmon, consume, more, wild, fish, than, they, generate, as, a, final, product, although, the, efficiency, of, production, is, improving, to, produce, one, kilograms, of, farmed, salmon, products, from, several, kilograms, of, wild, fish, are, fed, to, them, this, can, be, described, as, the, fish, in, fish, out, fifo, ratio, in, 1995, salmon, had, a, fifo, ratio, of, 7, 5, meaning, 7, 5, kilograms, of, wild, fish, feed, were, required, to, produce, one, kilogram, of, salmon, by, 2006, the, ratio, had, fallen, to, 4, 9, additionally, a, growing, share, of, fish, oil, and, fishmeal, come, from, residues, byproducts, of, fish, processing, rather, than, dedicated, whole, fish, in, 2012, 34, percent, of, fish, oil, and, 28, percent, of, fishmeal, came, from, residues, however, fishmeal, and, oil, from, residues, instead, of, whole, fish, have, a, different, composition, with, more, ash, and, less, protein, which, may, limit, its, potential, use, for, aquaculture, as, the, salmon, farming, industry, expands, it, requires, more, wild, forage, fish, for, feed, at, a, time, when, seventy, five, percent, of, the, world, s, monitored, fisheries, are, already, near, to, or, have, exceeded, their, maximum, sustainable, yield, the, industrial, scale, extraction, of, wild, forage, fish, for, salmon, farming, then, impacts, the, survivability, of, the, wild, predator, fish, who, rely, on, them, for, food, an, important, step, in, reducing, the, impact, of, aquaculture, on, wild, fish, is, shifting, carnivorous, species, to, plant, based, feeds, salmon, feeds, for, example, have, gone, from, containing, only, fishmeal, and, oil, to, containing, 40, percent, plant, protein, the, usda, has, also, experimented, with, using, grain, based, feeds, for, farmed, trout, when, properly, formulated, and, often, mixed, with, fishmeal, or, oil, plant, based, feeds, can, provide, proper, nutrition, and, similar, growth, rates, in, carnivorous, farmed, fish, another, impact, aquaculture, production, can, have, on, wild, fish, is, the, risk, of, fish, escaping, from, coastal, pens, where, they, can, interbreed, with, their, wild, counterparts, diluting, wild, genetic, stocks, escaped, fish, can, become, invasive, out, competing, native, species, as, with, the, farming, of, terrestrial, animals, social, attitudes, influence, the, need, for, humane, practices, and, regulations, in, farmed, marine, animals, under, the, guidelines, advised, by, the, farm, animal, welfare, council, good, animal, welfare, means, both, fitness, and, a, sense, of, well, being, in, the, animal, s, physical, and, mental, state, this, can, be, defined, by, the, five, freedoms, however, the, controversial, issue, in, aquaculture, is, whether, fish, and, farmed, marine, invertebrates, are, actually, sentient, or, have, the, perception, and, awareness, to, experience, suffering, although, no, evidence, of, this, has, been, found, in, marine, invertebrates, recent, studies, conclude, that, fish, do, have, the, necessary, receptors, nociceptors, to, sense, noxious, stimuli, and, so, are, likely, to, experience, states, of, pain, fear, and, stress, consequently, welfare, in, aquaculture, is, directed, at, vertebrates, finfish, in, particular, welfare, in, aquaculture, can, be, impacted, by, a, number, of, issues, such, as, stocking, densities, behavioural, interactions, disease, and, parasitism, a, major, problem, in, determining, the, cause, of, impaired, welfare, is, that, these, issues, are, often, all, interrelated, and, influence, each, other, at, different, times, optimal, stocking, density, is, often, defined, by, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, stocked, environment, and, the, amount, of, individual, space, needed, by, the, fish, which, is, very, species, specific, although, behavioural, interactions, such, as, shoaling, may, mean, that, high, stocking, densities, are, beneficial, to, some, species, in, many, cultured, species, high, stocking, densities, may, be, of, concern, crowding, can, constrain, normal, swimming, behaviour, as, well, as, increase, aggressive, and, competitive, behaviours, such, as, cannibalism, feed, competition, territoriality, and, dominance, subordination, hierarchies, this, potentially, increases, the, risk, of, tissue, damage, due, to, abrasion, from, fish, to, fish, contact, or, fish, to, cage, contact, fish, can, suffer, reductions, in, food, intake, and, food, conversion, efficiency, in, addition, high, stocking, densities, can, result, in, water, flow, being, insufficient, creating, inadequate, oxygen, supply, and, waste, product, removal, dissolved, oxygen, is, essential, for, fish, respiration, and, concentrations, below, critical, levels, can, induce, stress, and, even, lead, to, asphyxiation, ammonia, a, nitrogen, excretion, product, is, highly, toxic, to, fish, at, accumulated, levels, particularly, when, oxygen, concentrations, are, low, many, of, these, interactions, and, effects, cause, stress, in, the, fish, which, can, be, a, major, factor, in, facilitating, fish, disease, for, many, parasites, infestation, depends, on, the, host, s, degree, of, mobility, the, density, of, the, host, population, and, vulnerability, of, the, host, s, defence, system, sea, lice, are, the, primary, parasitic, problem, for, finfish, in, aquaculture, high, numbers, causing, widespread, skin, erosion, and, haemorrhaging, gill, congestion, and, increased, mucus, production, there, are, also, a, number, of, prominent, viral, and, bacterial, pathogens, that, can, have, severe, effects, on, internal, organs, and, nervous, systems, the, key, to, improving, welfare, of, marine, cultured, organisms, is, to, reduce, stress, to, a, minimum, as, prolonged, or, repeated, stress, can, cause, a, range, of, adverse, effects, attempts, to, minimise, stress, can, occur, throughout, the, culture, process, understanding, and, providing, required, environmental, enrichment, can, be, vital, for, reducing, stress, and, benefit, aquaculture, objects, such, as, improved, growth, body, condition, and, reduced, damage, from, aggression, during, grow, out, it, is, important, to, keep, stocking, densities, at, appropriate, levels, specific, to, each, species, as, well, as, separating, size, classes, and, grading, to, reduce, aggressive, behavioural, interactions, keeping, nets, and, cages, clean, can, assist, positive, water, flow, to, reduce, the, risk, of, water, degradation, not, surprisingly, disease, and, parasitism, can, have, a, major, effect, on, fish, welfare, and, it, is, important, for, farmers, not, only, to, manage, infected, stock, but, also, to, apply, disease, prevention, measures, however, prevention, methods, such, as, vaccination, can, also, induce, stress, because, of, the, extra, handling, and, injection, other, methods, include, adding, antibiotics, to, feed, adding, chemicals, into, water, for, treatment, baths, and, biological, control, such, as, using, cleaner, wrasse, to, remove, lice, from, farmed, salmon, many, steps, are, involved, in, transport, including, capture, food, deprivation, to, reduce, faecal, contamination, of, transport, water, transfer, to, transport, vehicle, via, nets, or, pumps, plus, transport, and, transfer, to, the, delivery, location, during, transport, water, needs, to, be, maintained, to, a, high, quality, with, regulated, temperature, sufficient, oxygen, and, minimal, waste, products, in, some, cases, anaesthetics, may, be, used, in, small, doses, to, calm, fish, before, transport, aquaculture, is, sometimes, part, of, an, environmental, rehabilitation, program, or, as, an, aid, in, conserving, endangered, species, aquaculture, is, becoming, a, significant, threat, to, coastal, ecosystems, about, 20, percent, of, mangrove, forests, have, been, destroyed, since, 1980, partly, due, to, shrimp, farming, an, extended, cost, benefit, analysis, of, the, total, economic, value, of, shrimp, aquaculture, built, on, mangrove, ecosystems, found, that, the, external, costs, were, much, higher, than, the, external, benefits, over, four, decades, 269, 000, hectares, 660, 000, acres, of, indonesian, mangroves, have, been, converted, to, shrimp, farms, most, of, these, farms, are, abandoned, within, a, decade, because, of, the, toxin, build, up, and, nutrient, loss, salmon, farms, are, typically, sited, in, pristine, coastal, ecosystems, which, they, then, pollute, a, farm, with, 200, 000, salmon, discharges, more, fecal, waste, than, a, city, of, 60, 000, people, this, waste, is, discharged, directly, into, the, surrounding, aquatic, environment, untreated, often, containing, antibiotics, and, pesticides, there, is, also, an, accumulation, of, heavy, metals, on, the, benthos, seafloor, near, the, salmon, farms, particularly, copper, and, zinc, in, 2016, mass, fish, kill, events, impacted, salmon, farmers, along, chile, s, coast, and, the, wider, ecology, increases, in, aquaculture, production, and, its, associated, effluent, were, considered, to, be, possible, contributing, factors, to, fish, and, molluscan, mortality, sea, cage, aquaculture, is, responsible, for, nutrient, enrichment, of, the, waters, in, which, they, are, established, this, results, from, fish, wastes, and, uneaten, feed, inputs, elements, of, most, concern, are, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, which, can, promote, algal, growth, including, harmful, algal, blooms, which, can, be, toxic, to, fish, flushing, times, current, speeds, distance, from, the, shore, and, water, depth, are, important, considerations, when, locating, sea, cages, in, order, to, minimize, the, impacts, of, nutrient, enrichment, on, coastal, ecosystems, the, extent, of, the, effects, of, pollution, from, sea, cage, aquaculture, varies, depending, on, where, the, cages, are, located, which, species, are, kept, how, densely, cages, are, stocked, and, what, the, fish, are, fed, important, species, specific, variables, include, the, species, food, conversion, ratio, fcr, and, nitrogen, retention, whole, lake, experiments, carried, out, at, the, experimental, lakes, area, in, ontario, canada, have, displayed, the, potential, for, cage, aquaculture, to, source, numerous, changes, in, freshwater, ecosystems, following, the, initiation, of, an, experimental, rainbow, trout, cage, farm, in, a, small, boreal, lake, dramatic, reductions, in, mysis, concentrations, associated, with, a, decrease, in, dissolved, oxygen, were, observed, significant, increases, in, ammonium, and, total, phosphorus, a, driver, for, eutrophication, in, freshwater, systems, were, measured, in, the, hypolimnion, of, the, lake, annual, phosphorus, inputs, from, aquaculture, waste, exceeded, that, of, natural, inputs, from, atmospheric, deposition, and, inflows, and, phytoplankton, biomass, has, had, a, fourfold, annual, increase, following, the, initiation, of, the, experimental, farm, a, type, of, salmon, called, the, aquadvantage, salmon, has, been, genetically, modified, for, faster, growth, although, it, has, not, been, approved, for, commercial, use, due, to, controversy, the, altered, salmon, incorporates, a, growth, hormone, from, a, chinook, salmon, that, allows, it, to, reach, full, size, in, 16, 28, months, instead, of, the, normal, 36, months, for, atlantic, salmon, and, while, consuming, 25, percent, less, feed, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, reviewed, the, aquadvantage, salmon, in, a, draft, environmental, assessment, and, determined, that, it, would, not, have, a, significant, impact, fonsi, on, the, u, s, environment, a, major, difficulty, for, aquaculture, is, the, tendency, towards, monoculture, and, the, associated, risk, of, widespread, disease, aquaculture, is, also, associated, with, environmental, risks, for, instance, shrimp, farming, has, caused, the, destruction, of, important, mangrove, forests, throughout, southeast, asia, in, the, 1990s, disease, wiped, out, china, s, farmed, farrer, s, scallop, and, white, shrimp, and, required, their, replacement, by, other, species, aquaculture, has, an, average, annual, growth, rate, of, 9, 2, however, the, success, and, continued, expansion, of, the, fish, farming, sector, is, highly, dependent, on, the, control, of, fish, pathogens, including, a, wide, range, of, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and, parasites, in, 2014, it, was, estimated, that, these, parasites, cost, the, global, salmon, farming, industry, up, to, 400, million, euros, this, represents, 6, 10, of, the, production, value, of, the, affected, countries, but, it, can, go, up, to, 20, fisheries, and, oceans, canada, 2014, since, pathogens, quickly, spread, within, a, population, of, cultured, fish, their, control, is, vital, for, the, sector, historically, the, use, of, antibiotics, was, against, bacterial, epizootics, but, the, production, of, animal, proteins, has, to, be, sustainable, which, means, that, preventive, measures, that, are, acceptable, from, a, biological, and, environmental, point, of, view, should, be, used, to, keep, disease, problems, in, aquaculture, at, an, acceptable, level, so, this, added, to, the, efficiency, of, vaccines, resulted, in, an, immediate, and, permanent, reduction, in, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, the, 90s, in, the, beginning, there, were, fish, immersion, vaccines, efficient, against, the, vibriosis, but, proved, ineffective, against, the, furunculosis, hence, the, arrival, of, injectable, vaccines, first, water, based, and, after, oil, based, much, more, efficient, sommerset, 2005, it, is, the, important, mortality, in, cages, among, farmed, fish, the, debates, around, dna, injection, vaccines, although, effective, their, safety, and, their, side, effects, but, also, societal, expectations, for, cleaner, fish, and, security, lead, research, on, new, vaccine, vectors, several, initiatives, are, financed, by, the, european, union, to, develop, a, rapid, and, cost, effective, approach, to, using, bacteria, in, feed, to, make, vaccines, in, particular, thanks, to, lactic, bacteria, whose, dna, is, modified, boudinot, 2006, in, fact, vaccinating, farmed, fish, by, injection, is, time, consuming, and, costly, so, vaccines, can, be, administered, orally, or, by, immersion, by, being, added, to, feed, or, directly, into, water, this, allows, vaccinating, many, individuals, at, the, same, time, while, limiting, the, associated, handling, and, stress, indeed, many, tests, are, necessary, because, the, antigens, of, the, vaccines, must, be, adapted, to, each, species, or, not, present, a, certain, level, of, variability, or, they, will, not, have, any, effect, for, example, tests, have, been, done, with, two, species, lepeophtheirus, salmonis, from, which, the, antigens, were, collected, and, caligus, rogercresseyi, which, was, vaccinated, with, the, antigens, although, the, homology, between, the, two, species, is, important, the, level, of, variability, made, the, protection, ineffective, fisheries, and, oceans, canada, 2014, there, are, 24, vaccines, available, and, one, for, lobsters, the, first, vaccine, was, used, in, the, usa, against, enteric, red, mouth, in, 1976, however, there, are, 19, companies, and, some, small, stakeholders, are, producing, vaccines, for, aquaculture, nowadays, the, novel, approaches, are, a, way, forward, to, prevent, the, loss, of, 10, of, aquaculture, through, disease, genetically, modified, vaccines, are, not, being, used, in, the, eu, due, to, societal, concerns, and, regulations, meanwhile, dna, vaccines, are, now, authorised, in, the, eu, there, are, challenges, in, fish, vaccine, development, immune, response, due, to, lack, of, potent, adjscientists, are, considering, microdose, application, in, future, but, there, are, also, exciting, opportunities, in, aquaculture, vaccinology, due, to, the, low, cost, of, technology, regulations, change, and, novel, antigen, expression, and, delivery, systems, in, norway, subunit, vaccine, vp2, peptide, against, infectious, pancreatic, necrosis, is, being, used, in, canada, a, licensed, dna, vaccine, against, infectious, hematopoietic, necrosis, has, been, launched, for, industry, use, fish, have, large, mucosal, surfaces, so, the, preferred, route, is, immersion, intraperitoneal, and, oral, respectively, nanoparticles, are, in, progress, for, delivery, purposes, the, common, antibodies, produced, are, igm, and, igt, normally, booster, is, not, required, ifn, fish, because, more, memory, cells, are, produced, in, response, to, the, booster, rather, than, an, increased, level, of, antibodies, mrna, vaccines, are, alternative, to, dna, vaccines, because, they, are, more, safe, stable, easily, producible, at, a, large, scale, and, mass, immunization, potential, recently, these, are, used, in, cancer, prevention, and, therapeutics, studies, in, rabies, has, shown, that, efficacy, depends, on, dose, and, route, of, administration, these, are, still, in, infancy, in, 2014, the, aquaculture, produced, fish, overtook, wild, caught, fish, in, supply, for, human, food, this, means, there, is, a, huge, demand, for, vaccines, in, prevention, of, diseases, the, reported, annual, loss, fish, calculates, to, 10, billion, usd, this, is, from, approximately, 10, of, all, fishes, dying, from, infectious, diseases, the, high, annual, losses, increases, the, demand, for, vaccines, even, though, there, are, about, 24, traditionally, used, vaccines, there, is, still, demand, for, more, vaccines, the, breakthrough, of, dna, vaccines, has, sunk, the, cost, of, vaccines, the, alternative, to, vaccines, would, be, antibiotics, and, chemotherapy, which, are, more, expensive, and, with, bigger, drawbacks, dna, vaccines, have, become, the, most, cost, efficient, method, of, preventing, infectious, diseases, this, bouts, well, for, dna, vaccines, becoming, the, new, standard, both, in, fish, vaccines, and, in, general, vaccines, sediment, from, abandoned, aquaculture, farms, can, remain, hypersaline, acidic, and, eroded, this, material, can, remain, unusable, for, aquaculture, purposes, for, long, periods, thereafter, various, chemical, treatments, such, as, adding, lime, can, aggravate, the, problem, by, modify, the, physicochemical, characteristics, of, the, sediment, aquaculture, produces, a, range, of, marine, debris, depending, on, the, product, and, location, the, most, frequently, documented, type, of, plastic, is, expanded, polystyrene, eps, used, extensively, in, floats, and, sea, cage, collars, mepc, 2020, other, common, waste, items, include, cage, nets, and, plastic, harvest, bins, a, review, of, aquaculture, as, a, source, of, marine, litter, in, the, north, baltic, and, mediterranean, seas, identified, 64, different, items, 19, of, which, were, unique, to, aquaculture, estimates, of, the, amount, of, aquaculture, waste, entering, the, oceans, vary, widely, depending, on, the, methodologies, used, for, example, in, the, european, economic, area, loss, estimates, have, varied, from, a, low, of, 3, 000, tonnes, to, 41, 000, tonnes, per, year, while, some, forms, of, aquaculture, can, be, devastating, to, ecosystems, such, as, shrimp, farming, in, mangroves, other, forms, can, be, beneficial,

decline, with, valuable, habitat, such, as, estuaries, in, critical, condition, the, aquaculture, or, farming, of, piscivorous, fish, like, salmon, does, not, help, the, problem, because, they, need, to, eat, products, from, other, fish, such, as, fish, meal, and, fish, oil, studies, have, shown, that, salmon, farming, has, major, negative, impacts, on, wild, salmon, as, well, as, the, forage, fish, that, need, to, be, caught, to, feed, them, fish, that, are, higher, on, the, food, chain, are, less, efficient, sources, of, food, energy, apart, from, fish, and, shrimp, some, aquaculture,

used, in, compost, or, in, some, cases, could, even, be, treated, and, used, on, land, while, ras, was, developed, with, freshwater, fish, in, mind, scientists, associated, with, the, agricultural, research, service, have, found, a, way, to, rear, saltwater, fish, using, ras, in, low, salinity, waters, although, saltwater, fish, are, raised, in, off, shore, cages, or, caught, with, nets, in, water, that, typically, has, a, salinity, of, 35, parts, per, thousand, ppt, scientists, were, able, to, produce, healthy, pompano, a, saltwater, fish, in, tanks, with, a, salinity, of, only, 5, ppt, commercializing, low, salinity, ras, are, predicted, to, have, positive, environmental, and, economical, effects, unwanted, nutrients, from, the, fish, food, would, not, be, added, to, the, ocean,
