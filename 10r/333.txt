the, name, london, bridge, refers, to, several, historic, crossings, that, have, spanned, the, river, thames, between, the, city, of, london, and, southwark, in, central, london, since, roman, times, the, current, crossing, which, opened, to, traffic, in, 1973, is, a, box, girder, bridge, built, from, concrete, and, steel, it, replaced, a, 19th, century, stone, arched, bridge, which, in, turn, superseded, a, 600, year, old, stone, built, medieval, structure, in, addition, to, the, roadway, for, much, of, its, history, the, broad, medieval, bridge, supported, an, extensive, built, up, area, of, homes, and, businesses, part, of, the, city, s, bridge, ward, and, its, southern, end, in, southwark, was, guarded, by, a, large, stone, city, gateway, the, medieval, bridge, was, preceded, by, a, succession, of, timber, bridges, the, first, of, which, was, built, by, the, roman, founders, of, london, londinium, around, 50, ad, the, current, bridge, stands, at, the, western, end, of, the, pool, of, london, and, is, positioned, 30, metres, 98, ft, upstream, from, previous, alignments, the, approaches, to, the, medieval, bridge, were, marked, by, the, church, of, st, magnus, the, martyr, on, the, northern, bank, and, by, southwark, cathedral, on, the, southern, shore, until, putney, bridge, opened, in, 1729, london, bridge, was, the, only, road, crossing, of, the, thames, downstream, of, kingston, upon, thames, london, bridge, has, been, depicted, in, its, several, forms, in, art, literature, and, songs, including, the, nursery, rhyme, london, bridge, is, falling, down, and, the, epic, poem, the, waste, land, by, t, s, eliot, the, modern, bridge, is, owned, and, maintained, by, bridge, house, estates, an, independent, charity, of, medieval, origin, overseen, by, the, city, of, london, corporation, it, carries, the, a3, road, which, is, maintained, by, the, greater, london, authority, the, crossing, also, delineates, an, area, along, the, southern, bank, of, the, river, thames, between, london, bridge, and, tower, bridge, that, has, been, designated, as, a, business, improvement, district, the, abutments, of, modern, london, bridge, rest, several, metres, above, natural, embankments, of, gravel, sand, and, clay, from, the, late, neolithic, era, the, southern, embankment, formed, a, natural, causeway, above, the, surrounding, swamp, and, marsh, of, the, river, s, estuary, the, northern, ascended, to, higher, ground, at, the, present, site, of, cornhill, between, the, embankments, the, river, thames, could, have, been, crossed, by, ford, when, the, tide, was, low, or, ferry, when, it, was, high, both, embankments, particularly, the, northern, would, have, offered, stable, beachheads, for, boat, traffic, up, and, downstream, the, thames, and, its, estuary, were, a, major, inland, and, continental, trade, route, from, at, least, the, 9th, century, bc, there, is, archaeological, evidence, for, scattered, neolithic, bronze, age, and, iron, age, settlement, nearby, but, until, a, bridge, was, built, there, london, did, not, exist, a, few, miles, upstream, beyond, the, river, s, upper, tidal, reach, two, ancient, fords, were, in, use, these, were, apparently, aligned, with, the, course, of, watling, street, which, led, into, the, heartlands, of, the, catuvellauni, britain, s, most, powerful, tribe, at, the, time, of, caesar, s, invasion, of, 54, bc, some, time, before, claudius, s, conquest, of, ad, 43, power, shifted, to, the, trinovantes, who, held, the, region, northeast, of, the, thames, estuary, from, a, capital, at, camulodunum, nowadays, colchester, in, essex, claudius, imposed, a, major, colonia, at, camulodunum, and, made, it, the, capital, city, of, the, new, roman, province, of, britannia, the, first, london, bridge, was, built, by, the, romans, as, part, of, their, road, building, programme, to, help, consolidate, their, conquest, it, is, possible, that, roman, military, engineers, built, a, pontoon, type, bridge, at, the, site, during, the, conquest, period, ad, 43, a, bridge, of, any, kind, would, have, given, a, rapid, overland, shortcut, to, camulodunum, from, the, southern, and, kentish, ports, along, the, roman, roads, of, stane, street, and, watling, street, now, the, a2, the, roman, roads, leading, to, and, from, london, were, probably, built, around, ad, 50, and, the, river, crossing, was, possibly, served, by, a, permanent, timber, bridge, on, the, relatively, high, dry, ground, at, the, northern, end, of, the, bridge, a, small, opportunistic, trading, and, shipping, settlement, took, root, and, grew, into, the, town, of, londinium, a, smaller, settlement, developed, at, the, southern, end, of, the, bridge, in, the, area, now, known, as, southwark, the, bridge, may, have, been, destroyed, along, with, the, town, in, the, boudican, revolt, ad, 60, but, londinium, was, rebuilt, and, eventually, became, the, administrative, and, mercantile, capital, of, roman, britain, the, bridge, offered, uninterrupted, mass, movement, of, foot, horse, and, wheeled, traffic, across, the, thames, linking, four, major, arterial, road, systems, north, of, the, thames, with, four, to, the, south, just, downstream, of, the, bridge, were, substantial, quays, and, depots, convenient, to, seagoing, trade, between, britain, and, the, rest, of, the, roman, empire, with, the, end, of, roman, rule, in, britain, in, the, early, 5th, century, londinium, was, gradually, abandoned, and, the, bridge, fell, into, disrepair, in, the, anglo, saxon, period, the, river, became, a, boundary, between, the, emergent, mutually, hostile, kingdoms, of, mercia, and, wessex, by, the, late, 9th, century, danish, invasions, prompted, at, least, a, partial, reoccupation, of, the, site, by, the, saxons, the, bridge, may, have, been, rebuilt, by, alfred, the, great, soon, after, the, battle, of, edington, as, part, of, alfred, s, redevelopment, of, the, area, in, his, system, of, burhs, or, it, may, have, been, rebuilt, around, 990, under, the, saxon, king, thelred, the, unready, to, hasten, his, troop, movements, against, sweyn, forkbeard, father, of, cnut, the, great, a, skaldic, tradition, describes, the, bridge, s, destruction, in, 1014, by, thelred, s, ally, olaf, to, divide, the, danish, forces, who, held, both, the, walled, city, of, london, and, southwark, the, earliest, contemporary, written, reference, to, a, saxon, bridge, is, c, 1016, when, chroniclers, mention, how, cnut, s, ships, bypassed, the, crossing, during, his, war, to, regain, the, throne, from, edmund, ironside, following, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, king, william, i, rebuilt, the, bridge, it, was, repaired, or, replaced, by, king, william, ii, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1136, and, rebuilt, in, the, reign, of, stephen, henry, ii, created, a, monastic, guild, the, brethren, of, the, bridge, to, oversee, all, work, on, london, bridge, in, 1163, peter, of, colechurch, chaplain, and, warden, of, the, bridge, and, its, brethren, supervised, the, bridge, s, last, rebuilding, in, timber, after, the, murder, of, his, former, friend, and, later, opponent, thomas, becket, archbishop, of, canterbury, the, penitent, king, henry, ii, commissioned, a, new, stone, bridge, in, place, of, the, old, with, a, chapel, at, its, centre, dedicated, to, becket, as, martyr, the, archbishop, had, been, a, native, londoner, born, at, cheapside, and, a, popular, figure, the, chapel, of, st, thomas, on, the, bridge, became, the, official, start, of, pilgrimage, to, his, canterbury, shrine, it, was, grander, than, some, town, parish, churches, and, had, an, additional, river, level, entrance, for, fishermen, and, ferrymen, building, work, began, in, 1176, supervised, by, peter, of, colechurch, the, costs, would, have, been, enormous, henry, s, attempt, to, meet, them, with, taxes, on, wool, and, sheepskins, probably, gave, rise, to, a, later, legend, that, london, bridge, was, built, on, wool, packs, in, 1202, before, colechurch, s, death, isembert, a, french, monk, who, was, renowned, as, a, bridge, builder, was, appointed, by, king, john, to, complete, the, project, construction, was, not, finished, until, 1209, there, were, houses, on, the, bridge, from, the, start, this, was, a, normal, way, of, paying, for, the, maintenance, of, a, bridge, though, in, this, case, it, had, to, be, supplemented, by, other, rents, and, by, tolls, from, 1282, two, bridge, wardens, were, responsible, for, maintaining, the, bridge, heading, the, organization, known, as, the, bridge, house, the, only, two, collapses, occurred, when, maintenance, had, been, neglected, in, 1281, five, arches, and, 1437, two, arches, in, 1212, perhaps, the, greatest, of, the, early, fires, of, london, broke, out, spreading, as, far, as, the, chapel, and, trapping, many, people, the, bridge, was, about, 926, feet, 282, metres, long, and, had, nineteen, piers, linked, by, nineteen, arches, and, a, wooden, drawbridge, there, were, starlings, around, the, piers, to, protect, them, they, had, deeper, piles, than, the, piers, themselves, the, bridge, including, the, part, occupied, by, houses, was, from, 20, to, 24, feet, 6, 1, to, 7, 3, metres, wide, the, roadway, was, mostly, around, 15, feet, 4, 6, metres, wide, varying, from, about, 14, feet, to, 16, feet, except, that, it, was, narrower, at, defensive, features, the, stone, gate, the, drawbridge, and, the, drawbridge, tower, and, wider, south, of, the, stone, gate, the, houses, occupied, only, a, few, feet, on, each, side, of, the, bridge, they, received, their, main, support, either, from, the, piers, which, extended, well, beyond, the, bridge, itself, from, west, to, east, or, from, hammer, beams, laid, from, pier, to, pier, parallel, to, the, bridge, it, was, the, length, of, the, piers, which, made, it, possible, to, build, quite, large, houses, up, to, 34, feet, 10, metres, deep, the, numerous, starlings, restricted, the, river, s, tidal, ebb, and, flow, the, difference, in, water, levels, on, the, two, sides, of, the, bridge, could, be, as, much, as, 6, feet, 1, 8, m, producing, ferocious, rapids, between, the, piers, resembling, a, weir, only, the, brave, or, foolhardy, attempted, to, shoot, the, bridge, steer, a, boat, between, the, starlings, when, in, flood, and, some, were, drowned, in, the, attempt, the, bridge, was, for, wise, men, to, pass, over, and, for, fools, to, pass, under, the, restricted, flow, also, meant, that, in, hard, winters, the, river, upstream, was, more, susceptible, to, freezing, the, number, of, houses, on, the, bridge, reached, its, maximum, in, the, late, fourteenth, century, when, there, were, 140, subsequently, many, of, the, houses, originally, only, 10, to, 11, feet, wide, were, merged, so, that, by, 1605, there, were, 91, originally, they, are, likely, to, have, had, only, two, storeys, but, they, were, gradually, enlarged, in, the, seventeenth, century, when, there, are, detailed, descriptions, of, them, almost, all, had, four, or, five, storeys, counting, the, garrets, as, a, storey, three, houses, had, six, storeys, two, thirds, of, the, houses, were, rebuilt, from, 1477, to, 1548, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, usual, plan, was, a, shop, on, the, ground, floor, a, hall, and, often, a, chamber, on, the, first, floor, a, kitchen, and, usually, a, chamber, and, a, waterhouse, for, hauling, up, water, in, buckets, on, the, second, floor, and, chambers, and, garrets, above, approximately, every, other, house, shared, in, a, cross, building, above, the, roadway, linking, the, houses, either, side, and, extending, from, the, first, floor, upwards, all, the, houses, were, shops, and, the, bridge, was, one, of, the, city, of, london, s, four, or, five, main, shopping, streets, there, seems, to, have, been, a, deliberate, attempt, to, attract, the, more, prestigious, trades, in, the, late, fourteenth, century, more, than, four, fifths, of, the, shopkeepers, were, haberdashers, glovers, cutlers, bowyers, and, fletchers, or, from, related, trades, by, 1600, all, of, these, had, dwindled, except, the, haberdashers, and, the, spaces, were, filled, by, additional, haberdashers, by, traders, selling, textiles, and, by, grocers, from, the, late, seventeenth, century, there, was, a, greater, variety, of, trades, including, metalworkers, such, as, pinmakers, and, needle, makers, sellers, of, durable, goods, such, as, trunks, and, brushes, booksellers, and, stationers, the, three, major, buildings, on, the, bridge, were, the, chapel, the, drawbridge, tower, and, the, stone, gate, all, of, which, seem, to, have, been, present, soon, after, the, bridge, s, construction, the, chapel, was, last, rebuilt, in, 1387, 1396, by, henry, yevele, master, mason, to, the, king, following, the, reformation, it, was, converted, into, a, house, in, 1553, the, drawbridge, tower, was, where, the, severed, heads, of, traitors, were, exhibited, the, drawbridge, ceased, to, be, opened, in, the, 1470s, and, in, 1577, 1579, the, tower, was, replaced, by, nonsuch, house, a, pair, of, magnificent, houses, its, architect, was, lewis, stockett, surveyor, of, the, queen, s, works, who, gave, it, the, second, classical, facade, in, london, after, somerset, house, in, the, strand, the, stone, gate, was, last, rebuilt, in, the, 1470s, and, later, took, over, the, function, of, displaying, the, heads, of, traitors, the, heads, were, dipped, in, tar, and, boiled, to, preserve, them, against, the, elements, and, were, impaled, on, pikes, the, head, of, william, wallace, was, the, first, recorded, as, appearing, in, 1305, starting, a, long, tradition, other, famous, heads, on, pikes, included, those, of, jack, cade, in, 1450, thomas, more, in, 1535, bishop, john, fisher, in, the, same, year, and, thomas, cromwell, in, 1540, in, 1598, a, german, visitor, to, london, paul, hentzner, counted, over, 30, heads, on, the, bridge, on, the, south, is, a, bridge, of, stone, eight, hundred, feet, in, length, of, wonderful, work, it, is, supported, upon, twenty, piers, of, square, stone, sixty, feet, high, and, thirty, broad, joined, by, arches, of, about, twenty, feet, diameter, the, whole, is, covered, on, each, side, with, houses, so, disposed, as, to, have, the, appearance, of, a, continued, street, not, at, all, of, a, bridge, upon, this, is, built, a, tower, on, whose, top, the, heads, of, such, as, have, been, executed, for, high, treason, are, placed, on, iron, spikes, we, counted, above, thirty, the, last, head, was, installed, in, 1661, subsequently, heads, were, placed, on, temple, bar, instead, until, the, practice, ceased, there, were, two, multi, seated, public, latrines, but, they, seem, to, have, been, at, the, two, ends, of, the, bridge, possibly, on, the, riverbank, the, one, at, the, north, end, had, two, entrances, in, 1306, in, 1481, one, of, the, latrines, fell, into, the, thames, and, five, men, were, drowned, neither, of, the, latrines, is, recorded, after, 1591, in, 1578, 1582, a, dutchman, peter, morris, created, a, waterworks, at, the, north, end, of, the, bridge, water, wheels, under, the, two, northernmost, arches, drove, pumps, that, raised, water, to, the, top, of, a, tower, from, which, wooden, pipes, conveyed, it, into, the, city, in, 1591, water, wheels, were, installed, at, the, south, end, of, the, bridge, to, grind, corn, in, 1633, fire, destroyed, the, houses, on, the, northern, part, of, the, bridge, the, gap, was, only, partly, filled, by, new, houses, with, the, result, that, there, was, a, firebreak, that, prevented, the, great, fire, of, london, 1666, spreading, to, the, rest, of, the, bridge, and, to, southwark, the, great, fire, destroyed, the, bridge, s, waterwheels, preventing, them, from, pumping, water, to, fight, the, fire, for, nearly, 20, years, only, sheds, replaced, the, burnt, buildings, they, were, replaced, in, the, 1680s, when, almost, all, the, houses, on, the, bridge, were, rebuilt, the, roadway, was, widened, to, 20, feet, 6, 1, metres, by, setting, the, houses, further, back, and, was, increased, in, height, from, one, storey, to, two, the, new, houses, extended, further, back, over, the, river, which, would, cause, trouble, later, in, 1695, the, bridge, had, 551, inhabitants, from, 1670, attempts, were, made, to, keep, traffic, in, each, direction, to, one, side, at, first, through, a, keep, right, policy, and, from, 1722, through, a, keep, left, policy, this, has, been, suggested, as, one, possible, origin, for, the, practice, of, traffic, in, britain, driving, on, the, left, a, fire, in, september, 1725, destroyed, all, the, houses, south, of, the, stone, gate, they, were, rebuilt, the, last, houses, to, be, built, on, the, bridge, were, designed, by, george, dance, the, elder, in, 1745, but, these, buildings, had, begun, to, subside, within, a, decade, the, london, bridge, act, 1756, 29, geo, 2, c, 40, gave, the, city, corporation, the, power, to, purchase, all, the, properties, on, the, bridge, so, that, they, could, be, demolished, and, the, bridge, improved, while, this, work, was, underway, a, temporary, wooden, bridge, was, constructed, to, the, west, of, london, bridge, it, opened, in, october, 1757, but, caught, fire, and, collapsed, in, the, following, april, the, old, bridge, was, reopened, until, a, new, wooden, construction, could, be, completed, a, year, later, to, help, improve, navigation, under, the, bridge, its, two, centre, arches, were, replaced, by, a, single, wider, span, the, great, arch, in, 1759, demolition, of, the, houses, was, completed, in, 1761, and, the, last, tenant, departed, after, some, 550, years, of, housing, on, the, bridge, under, the, supervision, of, dance, the, elder, the, roadway, was, widened, to, 46, feet, 14, m, and, a, balustrade, was, added, in, the, gothic, taste, together, with, 14, stone, alcoves, for, pedestrians, to, shelter, in, however, the, creation, of, the, great, arch, had, weakened, the, rest, of, the, structure, and, constant, expensive, repairs, were, required, in, the, following, decades, this, combined, with, congestion, both, on, and, under, bridge, often, leading, to, fatal, accidents, resulted, in, public, pressure, for, a, modern, replacement, in, 1799, a, competition, was, opened, to, design, a, replacement, for, the, medieval, bridge, entrants, included, thomas, telford, he, proposed, a, single, iron, arch, span, of, 600, feet, 180, m, with, 65, feet, 20, m, centre, clearance, beneath, it, for, masted, river, traffic, his, design, was, accepted, as, safe, and, practicable, following, expert, testimony, preliminary, surveys, and, works, were, begun, but, telford, s, design, required, exceptionally, wide, approaches, and, the, extensive, use, of, multiple, steeply, inclined, planes, which, would, have, required, the, purchase, and, demolition, of, valuable, adjacent, properties, a, more, conventional, design, of, five, stone, arches, by, john, rennie, was, chosen, instead, it, was, built, 100, feet, 30, m, west, upstream, of, the, original, site, by, jolliffe, and, banks, of, merstham, surrey, under, the, supervision, of, rennie, s, son, work, began, in, 1824, and, the, foundation, stone, was, laid, in, the, southern, coffer, dam, on, 15, june, 1825, the, old, bridge, continued, in, use, while, the, new, bridge, was, being, built, and, was, demolished, after, the, latter, opened, in, 1831, new, approach, roads, had, to, be, built, which, cost, three, times, as, much, as, the, bridge, itself, the, total, costs, around, 2, 5, million, 287, million, in, 2023, were, shared, by, the, british, government, and, the, corporation, of, london, rennie, s, bridge, was, 928, feet, 283, m, long, and, 49, feet, 15, m, wide, constructed, from, haytor, granite, the, official, opening, took, place, on, 1, august, 1831, king, william, iv, and, queen, adelaide, attended, a, banquet, in, a, pavilion, erected, on, the, bridge, the, northern, approach, road, king, william, street, was, renamed, after, the, monarch, in, 1896, the, bridge, was, the, busiest, point, in, london, and, one, of, its, most, congested, 8, 000, pedestrians, and, 900, vehicles, crossed, every, hour, to, designs, by, engineer, edward, cruttwell, it, was, widened, by, 13, feet, 4, 0, m, using, granite, corbels, subsequent, surveys, showed, that, the, bridge, was, sinking, an, inch, about, 2, 5, cm, every, eight, years, and, by, 1924, the, east, side, had, sunk, some, three, to, four, inches, about, 9, cm, lower, than, the, west, side, the, bridge, would, have, to, be, removed, and, replaced, common, council, of, the, city, of, london, member, ivan, luckin, put, forward, the, idea, of, selling, the, bridge, and, recalled, they, all, thought, i, was, completely, crazy, when, i, suggested, we, should, sell, london, bridge, when, it, needed, replacing, subsequently, in, 1968, council, placed, the, bridge, on, the, market, and, began, to, look, for, potential, buyers, on, 18, april, 1968, rennie, s, bridge, was, purchased, by, the, missourian, entrepreneur, robert, p, mcculloch, of, mcculloch, oil, for, us, 2, 460, 000, the, claim, that, mcculloch, believed, mistakenly, that, he, was, buying, the, more, impressive, tower, bridge, was, denied, by, luckin, in, a, newspaper, interview, before, the, bridge, was, taken, apart, each, granite, facing, block, was, marked, for, later, reassembly, the, blocks, were, taken, to, merrivale, quarry, at, princetown, in, devon, where, 15, to, 20, cm, 6, to, 8, in, were, sliced, off, the, inner, faces, of, many, to, facilitate, their, fixing, stones, left, behind, were, sold, in, an, online, auction, when, the, quarry, was, abandoned, and, flooded, in, 2003, 10, 000, tons, of, granite, blocks, were, shipped, via, the, panama, canal, to, california, then, trucked, from, long, beach, to, arizona, they, were, used, to, face, a, new, purpose, built, hollow, core, steel, reinforced, concrete, structure, ensuring, the, bridge, would, support, the, weight, of, modern, traffic, the, bridge, was, reconstructed, by, sundt, construction, at, lake, havasu, city, arizona, and, was, re, dedicated, on, 10, october, 1971, in, a, ceremony, attended, by, london, s, lord, mayor, and, celebrities, the, bridge, carries, the, mcculloch, boulevard, and, spans, the, bridgewater, channel, an, artificial, navigable, waterway, that, leads, from, the, uptown, area, of, lake, havasu, city, the, current, london, bridge, was, designed, by, architect, lord, holford, and, engineers, mott, hay, and, anderson, it, was, constructed, by, contractors, john, mowlem, and, co, from, 1967, to, 1972, and, opened, by, queen, elizabeth, ii, on, 16, march, 1973, it, comprises, three, spans, of, prestressed, concrete, box, girders, a, total, of, 833, feet, 254, m, long, the, cost, of, 4, million, 71, 4, million, in, 2023, was, met, entirely, by, the, bridge, house, estates, charity, the, current, bridge, was, built, in, the, same, location, as, rennie, s, bridge, with, the, previous, bridge, remaining, in, use, while, the, first, two, girders, were, constructed, upstream, and, downstream, traffic, was, then, transferred, onto, the, two, new, girders, and, the, previous, bridge, demolished, to, allow, the, final, two, central, girders, to, be, added, in, 1984, the, british, warship, hms, jupiter, collided, with, london, bridge, causing, significant, damage, to, both, the, ship, and, the, bridge, on, remembrance, day, 2004, several, bridges, in, london, were, furnished, with, red, lighting, as, part, of, a, night, time, flight, along, the, river, by,
