lumber, is, wood, that, has, been, processed, into, uniform, and, useful, sizes, dimensional, lumber, including, beams, and, planks, or, boards, lumber, is, mainly, used, for, construction, framing, as, well, as, finishing, floors, wall, panels, window, frames, lumber, has, many, uses, beyond, home, building, lumber, is, referred, to, as, timber, in, the, united, kingdom, europe, australia, and, new, zealand, while, in, other, parts, of, the, world, mainly, the, united, states, and, canada, the, term, timber, refers, specifically, to, unprocessed, wood, fiber, such, as, cut, logs, or, standing, trees, that, have, yet, to, be, cut, lumber, may, be, supplied, either, rough, sawn, or, surfaced, on, one, or, more, of, its, faces, rough, lumber, is, the, raw, material, for, furniture, making, and, manufacture, of, other, items, requiring, cutting, and, shaping, it, is, available, in, many, species, including, hardwoods, and, softwoods, such, as, white, pine, and, red, pine, because, of, their, low, cost, finished, lumber, is, supplied, in, standard, sizes, mostly, for, the, construction, industry, primarily, softwood, from, coniferous, species, including, pine, fir, and, spruce, collectively, spruce, pine, fir, cedar, and, hemlock, but, also, some, hardwood, for, high, grade, flooring, it, is, more, commonly, made, from, softwood, than, hardwoods, and, 80, of, lumber, comes, from, softwood, in, the, united, states, and, canada, milled, boards, are, called, lumber, while, timber, describes, standing, or, felled, trees, in, contrast, in, britain, and, some, other, commonwealth, nations, and, ireland, the, term, timber, is, used, in, both, senses, in, the, uk, the, word, lumber, is, rarely, used, in, relation, to, wood, and, has, several, other, meanings, re, manufactured, lumber, is, the, result, of, secondary, or, tertiary, processing, of, previously, milled, lumber, specifically, it, refers, to, lumber, cut, for, industrial, or, wood, packaging, use, lumber, is, cut, by, ripsaw, or, resaw, to, create, dimensions, that, are, not, usually, processed, by, a, primary, sawmill, re, sawing, is, the, splitting, of, 1, to, 12, inch, 25, 305, mm, hardwood, or, softwood, lumber, into, two, or, more, thinner, pieces, of, full, length, boards, for, example, splitting, a, 10, foot, long, 3, 0, m, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, by, 3, 1, 2, in, or, 38, by, 89, mm, into, two, 1, 4s, 3, 4, by, 3, 1, 2, in, or, 19, by, 89, mm, of, the, same, length, is, considered, re, sawing, structural, lumber, may, also, be, produced, from, recycled, plastic, and, new, plastic, stock, its, introduction, has, been, strongly, opposed, by, the, forestry, industry, blending, fiberglass, in, plastic, lumber, enhances, its, strength, durability, and, fire, resistance, plastic, fiberglass, structural, lumber, can, have, a, class, 1, flame, spread, rating, of, 25, or, less, when, tested, in, accordance, with, astm, standard, e, 84, which, means, it, burns, more, slowly, than, almost, all, treated, wood, lumber, the, basic, understanding, of, lumber, or, sawn, planks, came, about, in, north, america, in, the, seventeenth, century, lumber, is, the, most, common, and, widely, used, method, of, sawing, logs, plain, sawn, lumber, is, produced, by, making, the, first, cut, on, a, tangent, to, the, circumference, of, the, log, each, additional, cut, is, then, made, parallel, to, the, one, before, this, method, produces, the, widest, possible, boards, with, the, least, amount, of, log, waste, lumber, manufacturing, globally, is, determined, by, the, preferred, style, of, building, areas, with, a, wood, building, culture, homes, were, built, from, wood, rather, than, other, materials, like, brick, are, the, countries, with, significant, sawmilling, industries, historical, wood, frame, home, building, regions, are, europe, north, america, japan, different, areas, of, the, world, are, recognized, as, significant, timber, suppliers, however, these, areas, indonesia, sarawak, new, guinea, etc, are, exporters, of, raw, logs, and, do, not, have, a, significant, domestic, lumber, producing, industry, the, largest, lumber, manufacturing, regions, in, the, world, are, china, 18, united, states, 17, canada, 10, russia, 9, germany, 5, sweden, 4, in, early, periods, of, society, to, make, wood, for, building, the, trunks, of, trees, were, split, with, wedges, into, as, many, and, as, thin, pieces, as, possible, if, it, was, necessary, to, have, them, still, thinner, they, were, hewn, by, some, sharp, instrument, on, both, sides, to, the, proper, size, this, simple, but, wasteful, manner, of, making, boards, is, still, continued, in, some, places, otherwise, logs, were, sawn, using, a, two, person, whipsaw, or, pit, saw, using, saddleblocks, to, hold, the, log, and, a, pit, for, the, pitman, who, worked, below, in, 1420, the, island, of, madeira, an, archipelago, comprising, four, islands, off, the, northwest, coast, of, africa, and, an, autonomous, region, of, portugal, was, discovered, king, henry, vi, sent, settlers, to, madeira, and, the, settlers, started, clearing, the, huge, expanses, of, forest, in, order, to, grow, crops, felled, trees, were, made, into, planks, by, water, powered, mills, and, the, timber, cedar, and, yew, was, shipped, to, portugal, and, spain, about, 1427, the, first, sawmill, in, germany, was, built, cornelis, corneliszoon, or, krelis, lootjes, was, a, dutch, windmill, owner, from, uitgeest, who, invented, the, first, mechanical, sawmill, which, was, wind, powered, on, december, 15, 1593, this, made, the, conversion, of, log, timber, into, planks, 30, times, faster, than, previously, the, circular, saw, as, used, in, modern, sawmills, was, invented, by, an, englishman, named, miller, in, 1777, it, was, not, until, the, nineteenth, century, however, that, it, was, generally, applied, and, its, great, work, belongs, to, that, period, the, first, insertable, teeth, for, this, saw, were, invented, by, w, kendal, an, american, in, 1826, logging, in, the, american, colonies, began, in, 1607, when, the, jamestown, settlers, cut, timber, to, build, the, first, settlement, in, the, new, world, america, s, first, sawmill, was, built, at, the, falls, of, piscatauqua, on, the, line, between, the, province, of, maine, and, the, province, of, new, hampshire, in, 1634, unauthenticated, records, however, claim, that, as, early, as, 1633, several, mills, were, operating, in, new, netherland, the, american, colonies, were, essential, to, england, in, the, role, of, supplier, of, lumber, for, the, british, fleet, by, the, 1790s, new, england, was, exporting, 36, million, feet, of, pine, boards, and, at, least, 300, ship, masts, per, year, to, the, british, empire, the, timber, supply, began, to, dwindle, at, the, start, of, the, twentieth, century, due, to, significant, harvest, volumes, so, the, logging, industry, was, forced, to, seek, timber, elsewhere, hence, the, expansion, into, the, american, west, logs, are, converted, into, lumber, by, being, sawn, hewn, or, split, sawing, with, a, rip, saw, is, the, most, common, method, because, sawing, allows, logs, of, lower, quality, with, irregular, grain, and, large, knots, to, be, used, and, is, more, economical, there, are, various, types, of, sawing, dimensional, lumber, is, lumber, that, is, cut, to, standardized, width, and, depth, often, specified, in, millimetres, or, inches, but, see, below, for, information, on, nominal, dimensions, vs, actual, dimensions, carpenters, extensively, use, dimensional, lumber, in, framing, wooden, buildings, common, sizes, include, 2, 4, pictured, also, two, by, four, and, other, variants, such, as, four, by, two, in, australia, new, zealand, and, the, uk, 2, 6, and, 4, 4, the, length, of, a, board, is, usually, specified, separately, from, the, width, and, depth, it, is, thus, possible, to, find, 2, 4s, that, are, four, eight, and, twelve, feet, in, length, in, canada, and, the, united, states, the, standard, lengths, of, lumber, are, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and, 24, feet, 1, 8, 2, 4, 3, 0, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 9, 5, 5, 6, 1, 6, 7, and, 7, 3, m, for, wall, framing, precut, stud, lengths, are, available, and, are, commonly, used, for, ceilings, heights, of, 8, 9, or, 10, feet, 2, 4, 2, 7, or, 3, 0, m, studs, are, available, in, 92, 5, 8, inches, 2, 35, m, 104, 5, 8, inches, 2, 66, m, and, 116, 5, 8, inches, 2, 96, m, the, length, of, a, unit, of, dimensional, lumber, is, limited, by, the, height, and, girth, of, the, tree, it, is, milled, from, in, general, the, maximum, length, is, 24, ft, 7, 32, m, engineered, wood, products, manufactured, by, binding, the, strands, particles, fibers, or, veneers, of, wood, together, with, adhesives, to, form, composite, materials, offer, more, flexibility, and, greater, structural, strength, than, typical, wood, building, materials, pre, cut, studs, save, a, framer, much, time, because, they, are, pre, cut, by, the, manufacturer, for, use, in, 8, 9, and, 10, foot, ceiling, applications, which, means, the, manufacturer, has, removed, a, few, inches, or, centimetres, of, the, piece, to, allow, for, the, sill, plate, and, the, double, top, plate, with, no, additional, sizing, necessary, in, the, americas, two, bys, 2, 4s, 2, 6s, 2, 8s, 2, 10s, and, 2, 12s, named, for, traditional, board, thickness, in, inches, along, with, the, 4, 4, 89, mm, 89, mm, are, common, lumber, sizes, used, in, modern, construction, they, are, the, basic, building, blocks, for, such, common, structures, as, balloon, frame, or, platform, frame, housing, dimensional, lumber, made, from, softwood, is, typically, used, for, construction, while, hardwood, boards, are, more, commonly, used, for, making, cabinets, or, furniture, lumber, s, nominal, dimensions, are, larger, than, the, actual, standard, dimensions, of, finished, lumber, historically, the, nominal, dimensions, were, the, size, of, the, green, not, dried, rough, unfinished, boards, that, eventually, became, smaller, finished, lumber, through, drying, and, planing, to, smooth, the, wood, today, the, standards, specify, the, final, finished, dimensions, and, the, mill, cuts, the, logs, to, whatever, size, it, needs, to, achieve, those, final, dimensions, typically, that, rough, cut, is, smaller, than, the, nominal, dimensions, because, modern, technology, makes, it, possible, to, use, the, logs, more, efficiently, for, example, a, 2, 4, board, historically, started, out, as, a, green, rough, board, actually, 2, by, 4, inches, 51, mm, 102, mm, after, drying, and, planing, it, would, be, smaller, by, a, nonstandard, amount, today, a, 2, 4, board, starts, out, as, something, smaller, than, 2, inches, by, 4, inches, and, not, specified, by, standards, and, after, drying, and, planing, is, minimally, 1, 1, 2, by, 3, 1, 2, inches, 38, mm, 89, mm, as, previously, noted, less, wood, is, needed, to, produce, a, given, finished, size, than, when, standards, called, for, the, green, lumber, to, be, the, full, nominal, dimension, however, even, the, dimensions, for, finished, lumber, of, a, given, nominal, size, have, changed, over, time, in, 1910, a, typical, finished, 1, inch, 25, mm, board, was, 13, 16, in, 21, mm, in, 1928, that, was, reduced, by, 4, and, yet, again, by, 4, in, 1956, in, 1961, at, a, meeting, in, scottsdale, arizona, the, committee, on, grade, simplification, and, standardization, agreed, to, what, is, now, the, current, u, s, standard, in, part, the, dressed, size, of, a, 1, inch, nominal, board, was, fixed, at, 3, 4, inch, while, the, dressed, size, of, 2, inch, nominal, lumber, was, reduced, from, 1, 5, 8, inch, to, the, current, 1, 1, 2, inch, dimensional, lumber, is, available, in, green, unfinished, state, and, for, that, kind, of, lumber, the, nominal, dimensions, are, the, actual, dimensions, individual, pieces, of, lumber, exhibit, a, wide, range, in, quality, and, appearance, with, respect, to, knots, slope, of, grain, shakes, and, other, natural, characteristics, therefore, they, vary, considerably, in, strength, utility, and, value, the, move, to, set, national, standards, for, lumber, in, the, united, states, began, with, the, publication, of, the, american, lumber, standard, in, 1924, which, set, specifications, for, lumber, dimensions, grade, and, moisture, content, it, also, developed, inspection, and, accreditation, programs, these, standards, have, changed, over, the, years, to, meet, the, changing, needs, of, manufacturers, and, distributors, with, the, goal, of, keeping, lumber, competitive, with, other, construction, products, current, standards, are, set, by, the, american, lumber, standard, committee, appointed, by, the, u, s, secretary, of, commerce, design, values, for, most, species, and, grades, of, visually, graded, structural, products, are, determined, in, accordance, with, astm, standards, which, consider, the, effect, of, strength, reducing, characteristics, load, duration, safety, and, other, influencing, factors, the, applicable, standards, are, based, on, results, of, tests, conducted, in, cooperation, with, the, usda, forest, products, laboratory, design, values, for, wood, construction, which, is, a, supplement, to, the, ansi, af, pa, national, design, specification, for, wood, construction, provides, these, lumber, design, values, which, are, recognized, by, the, model, building, codes, canada, has, grading, rules, that, maintain, a, standard, among, mills, manufacturing, similar, woods, to, assure, customers, of, uniform, quality, grades, standardize, the, quality, of, lumber, at, different, levels, and, are, based, on, moisture, content, size, and, manufacture, at, the, time, of, grading, shipping, and, unloading, by, the, buyer, the, national, lumber, grades, authority, nlga, is, responsible, for, writing, interpreting, and, maintaining, canadian, lumber, grading, rules, and, standards, the, canadian, lumber, standards, accreditation, board, clsab, monitors, the, quality, of, canada, s, lumber, grading, and, identification, system, their, common, grade, abbrievation, cls, canadian, lumber, standard, is, well, utilised, in, the, construction, industry, attempts, to, maintain, lumber, quality, over, time, have, been, challenged, by, historical, changes, in, the, timber, resources, of, the, united, states, from, the, slow, growing, virgin, forests, common, over, a, century, ago, to, the, fast, growing, plantations, now, common, in, today, s, commercial, forests, resulting, declines, in, lumber, quality, have, been, of, concern, to, both, the, lumber, industry, and, consumers, and, have, caused, increased, use, of, alternative, construction, products, machine, stress, rated, and, machine, evaluated, lumber, are, readily, available, for, end, uses, where, high, strength, is, critical, such, as, trusses, rafters, laminating, stock, i, beams, and, web, joints, machine, grading, measures, a, characteristic, such, as, stiffness, or, density, that, correlates, with, the, structural, properties, of, interest, such, as, bending, strength, the, result, is, a, more, precise, understanding, of, the, strength, of, each, piece, of, lumber, than, is, possible, with, visually, graded, lumber, which, allows, designers, to, use, full, design, strength, and, avoid, overbuilding, in, europe, strength, grading, of, rectangular, sawn, lumber, timber, both, softwood, and, hardwood, is, done, according, to, en, 14081, and, commonly, sorted, into, classes, defined, by, en, 338, for, softwoods, the, common, classes, are, in, increasing, strength, c16, c18, c24, and, c30, there, are, also, classes, specifically, for, hardwoods, and, those, in, most, common, use, in, increasing, strength, are, d24, d30, d40, d50, d60, and, d70, for, these, classes, the, number, refers, to, the, required, 5th, percentile, bending, strength, in, newtons, per, square, millimetre, there, are, other, strength, classes, including, t, classes, based, on, tension, intended, for, use, in, glulam, grading, rules, for, african, and, south, american, sawn, lumber, have, been, developed, by, atibt, according, to, the, rules, of, the, sciages, aviv, s, tropicaux, africains, sata, and, is, based, on, clear, cuttings, established, by, the, percentage, of, the, clear, surface, in, north, america, market, practices, for, dimensional, lumber, made, from, hardwoods, varies, significantly, from, the, regularized, standardized, dimension, lumber, sizes, used, for, sales, and, specification, of, softwoods, hardwood, boards, are, often, sold, totally, rough, cut, or, machine, planed, only, on, the, two, broader, face, sides, when, hardwood, boards, are, also, supplied, with, planed, faces, it, is, usually, both, by, random, widths, of, a, specified, thickness, normally, matching, milling, of, softwood, dimensional, lumber, and, somewhat, random, lengths, but, besides, those, older, traditional, and, normal, situations, in, recent, years, some, product, lines, have, been, widened, to, also, market, boards, in, standard, stock, sizes, these, usually, retail, in, big, box, stores, and, using, only, a, relatively, small, set, of, specified, lengths, in, all, cases, hardwoods, are, sold, to, the, consumer, by, the, board, foot, 144, cubic, inches, or, 2, 360, cubic, centimetres, whereas, that, measure, is, not, used, for, softwoods, at, the, retailer, to, the, cognizance, of, the, buyer, also, in, north, america, hardwood, lumber, is, commonly, sold, in, a, quarter, system, when, referring, to, thickness, 4, 4, four, quarter, refers, to, a, 1, inch, thick, 25, mm, board, 8, 4, eight, quarter, is, a, 2, inch, thick, 51, mm, board, etc, this, quarter, system, is, rarely, used, for, softwood, lumber, although, softwood, decking, is, sometimes, sold, as, 5, 4, even, though, it, is, actually, one, inch, thick, from, milling, 1, 8, in, or, 3, 2, mm, off, each, side, in, a, motorized, planing, step, of, production, the, quarter, system, of, reference, is, a, traditional, north, american, lumber, industry, nomenclature, used, specifically, to, indicate, the, thickness, of, rough, sawn, hardwood, lumber, in, rough, sawn, lumber, it, immediately, clarifies, that, the, lumber, is, not, yet, milled, avoiding, confusion, with, milled, dimension, lumber, which, is, measured, as, actual, thickness, after, machining, examples, 3, 4, inch, 19, mm, or, 1x, in, recent, years, architects, designers, and, builders, have, begun, to, use, the, quarter, system, in, specifications, as, a, vogue, of, insider, knowledge, though, the, materials, being, specified, are, finished, lumber, thus, conflating, the, separate, systems, and, causing, confusion, hardwoods, cut, for, furniture, are, cut, in, the, fall, and, winter, after, the, sap, has, stopped, running, in, the, trees, if, hardwoods, are, cut, in, the, spring, or, summer, the, sap, ruins, the, natural, color, of, the, lumber, and, decreases, the, value, of, the, wood, for, furniture, engineered, lumber, is, lumber, created, by, a, manufacturer, and, designed, for, a, certain, structural, purpose, the, main, categories, of, engineered, lumber, are, in, the, united, states, pilings, are, mainly, cut, from, southern, yellow, pines, and, douglas, fir, treated, pilings, are, available, in, chromated, copper, arsenate, retentions, of, 0, 60, 0, 80, and, 2, 50, pounds, per, cubic, foot, 9, 6, 12, 8, and, 40, 0, kg, m, 3, if, treatment, is, required, under, the, prescription, of, the, method, of, construction, issued, by, the, song, dynasty, government, in, the, early, twelfth, century, timbers, were, standardized, to, eight, cross, sectional, dimensions, regardless, of, the, actual, dimensions, of, the, timber, the, ratio, between, width, and, height, was, maintained, at, 1, 1, 5, units, are, in, song, dynasty, inches, 31, 2, mm, timber, smaller, than, the, 8th, class, were, called, unclassed, the, width, of, a, timber, is, referred, to, as, one, timber, and, the, dimensions, of, other, structural, components, were, quoted, in, multiples, of, timber, thus, as, the, width, of, the, actual, timber, varied, the, dimensions, of, other, components, were, easily, calculated, without, resorting, to, specific, figures, for, each, scale, the, dimensions, of, timbers, in, similar, applications, show, a, gradual, diminution, from, the, sui, dynasty, 580, 618, to, the, modern, era, a, 1st, class, timber, during, the, sui, was, reconstructed, as, 15, 10, sui, dynasty, inches, or, 29, 4, mm, defects, occurring, in, lumber, are, grouped, into, the, following, four, divisions, during, the, process, of, converting, timber, to, commercial, forms, of, lumber, the, following, defects, may, occur, fungi, attack, wood, both, timber, and, lumber, when, these, conditions, are, all, present, wood, with, less, than, 25, moisture, dry, weight, basis, can, remain, free, of, decay, for, centuries, similarly, wood, submerged, in, water, may, not, be, attacked, by, fungi, if, the, amount, of, oxygen, is, inadequate, fungi, lumber, timber, defects, following, are, the, insects, and, molluscs, which, are, usually, responsible, for, the, decay, of, timber, lumber, there, are, two, main, natural, forces, responsible, for, causing, defects, in, timber, and, lumber, abnormal, growth, and, rupture, of, tissues, rupture, of, tissue, includes, cracks, or, splits, in, the, wood, called, shakes, ring, shake, wind, shake, or, ring, failure, is, when, the, wood, grain, separates, around, the, growth, rings, either, while, standing, or, during, felling, shakes, may, reduce, the, strength, of, a, timber, and, the, appearance, thus, reduce, lumber, grade, and, may, capture, moisture, promoting, decay, eastern, hemlock, is, known, for, having, ring, shake, a, check, is, a, crack, on, the, surface, of, the, wood, caused, by, the, outside, of, a, timber, shrinking, as, it, seasons, checks, may, extend, to, the, pith, and, follow, the, grain, like, shakes, checks, can, hold, water, promoting, rot, a, split, goes, all, the, way, through, a, timber, checks, and, splits, occur, more, frequently, at, the, ends, of, lumber, because, of, the, more, rapid, drying, in, these, locations, the, seasoning, of, lumber, is, typically, either, kiln, or, air, dried, defects, due, to, seasoning, are, the, main, cause, of, splits, bowing, and, honeycombing, seasoning, is, the, process, of, drying, timber, to, remove, the, bound, moisture, contained, in, the, walls, of, the, wood, cells, to, produce, seasoned, timber, under, proper, conditions, wood, provides, excellent, lasting, performance, however, it, also, faces, several, potential, threats, to, service, life, including, fungal, activity, and, insect, damage, which, can, be, avoided, in, numerous, ways, section, 2304, 11, of, the, international, building, code, addresses, protection, against, decay, and, termites, this, section, provides, requirements, for, non, residential, construction, applications, such, as, wood, used, above, ground, e, g, for, framing, decks, stairs, etc, as, well, as, other, applications, there, are, four, recommended, methods, to, protect, wood, frame, structures, against, durability, hazards, and, thus, provide, maximum, service, life, for, the, building, all, require, proper, design, and, construction, wood, is, a, hygroscopic, material, which, means, it, naturally, absorbs, and, releases, water, to, balance, its, internal, moisture, content, with, the, surrounding, environment, the, moisture, content, of, wood, is, measured, by, the, weight, of, water, as, a, percentage, of, the, oven, dry, weight, of, the, wood, fiber, the, key, to, controlling, decay, is, controlling, moisture, once, decay, fungi, are, established, the, minimum, moisture, content, for, decay, to, propagate, is, 22, to, 24, percent, so, building, experts, recommend, 19, percent, as, the, maximum, safe, moisture, content, for, untreated, wood, in, service, water, by, itself, does, not, harm, the, wood, but, rather, wood, with, consistently, high, moisture, content, enables, fungal, organisms, to, grow, the, primary, objective, when, addressing, moisture, loads, is, to, keep, water, from, entering, the, building, envelope, in, the, first, place, and, to, balance, the, moisture, content, within, the, building, itself, moisture, control, by, means, of, accepted, design, and, construction, details, is, a, simple, and, practical, method, of, protecting, a, wood, frame, building, against, decay, for, applications, with, a, high, risk, of, staying, wet, designers, specify, durable, materials, such, as, naturally, decay, resistant, species, or, wood, that, has, been, treated, with, preservatives, cladding, shingles, sill, plates, and, exposed, timbers, or, glulam, beams, are, examples, of, potential, applications, for, treated, wood, for, buildings, in, termite, zones, basic, protection, practices, addressed, in, current, building, codes, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, following, to, avoid, decay, and, termite, infestation, untreated, wood, is, separated, from, the, ground, and, other, sources, of, moisture, these, separations, are, required, by, many, building, codes, and, are, considered, necessary, to, maintain, wood, elements, in, permanent, structures, at, a, safe, moisture, content, for, decay, protection, when, it, is, not, possible, to, separate, wood, from, the, sources, of, moisture, designers, often, rely, on, preservative, treated, wood, wood, can, be, treated, with, a, preservative, that, improves, service, life, under, severe, conditions, without, altering, its, basic, characteristics, it, can, also, be, pressure, impregnated, with, fire, retardant, chemicals, that, improve, its, performance, in, a, fire, one, of, the, early, treatments, to, fireproof, lumber, which, retard, fires, was, developed, in, 1936, by, the, protexol, corporation, in, which, lumber, is, heavily, treated, with, salt, wood, does, not, deteriorate, simply, because, it, gets, wet, when, wood, breaks, down, it, is, because, an, organism, is, eating, it, preservatives, work, by, making, the, food, source, inedible, to, these, organisms, properly, preservative, treated, wood, can, have, 5, to, 10, times, the, service, life, of, untreated, wood, preserved, wood, is, used, most, often, for, railroad, ties, utility, poles, marine, piles, decks, fences, and, other, outdoor, applications, various, treatment, methods, and, types, of, chemicals, are, available, depending, on, the, attributes, required, in, the, particular, application, and, the, level, of, protection, needed, there, are, two, basic, methods, of, treating, with, and, without, pressure, non, pressure, methods, are, the, application, of, preservatives, by, brushing, spraying, or, dipping, the, piece, to, be, treated, deeper, more, thorough, penetration, is, achieved, by, driving, the, preservative, into, the, wood, cells, with, pressure, various, combinations, of, pressure, and, vacuum, are, used, to, force, adequate, levels, of, chemical, into, the, wood, pressure, treating, preservatives, consist, of, chemicals, carried, in, a, solvent, chromated, copper, arsenate, once, the, most, commonly, used, wood, preservative, in, north, america, began, being, phased, out, of, most, residential, applications, in, 2004, replacing, it, are, amine, copper, quat, and, copper, azole, all, wood, preservatives, used, in, the, united, states, and, canada, are, registered, and, regularly, re, examined, for, safety, by, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, and, health, canada, s, pest, management, and, regulatory, agency, respectively, timber, framing, is, a, style, of, construction, that, uses, heavier, framing, elements, larger, posts, and, beams, than, modern, stick, framing, which, uses, smaller, standard, dimensional, lumber, the, timbers, are, cut, from, log, boles, and, squared, with, a, saw, broadaxe, or, adze, and, then, joined, together, with, joinery, without, nails, modern, timber, framing, has, been, growing, in, popularity, in, the, united, states, since, the, 1970s, green, building, minimizes, the, impact, or, environmental, footprint, of, a, building, wood, is, a, major, building, material, that, is, renewable, and, replenishable, in, a, continuous, cycle, studies, show, manufacturing, wood, uses, less, energy, and, results, in, less, air, and, water, pollution, than, steel, and, concrete, however, demand, for, lumber, is, blamed, for, deforestation, the, conversion, from, coal, to, biomass, power, is, a, growing, trend, in, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, uzbekistan, kazakhstan, australia, fiji, madagascar, mongolia, russia, denmark, switzerland, and, eswatini, governments, all, support, an, increased, role, for, energy, derived, from, biomass, which, are, organic, materials, available, on, a, renewable, basis, and, include, residues, and, or, byproducts, of, the, logging, saw, milling, and, paper, making, processes, in, particular, they, view, it, as, a, way, to, lower, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, reducing, the, consumption, of, oil, and, gas, while, supporting, the, growth, of, forestry, agriculture, and, rural, economies, studies, by, the, u, s, government, have, found, the, country, s, combined, forest, and, agriculture, land, resources, have, the, power, to, sustainably, supply, more, than, one, third, of, its, current, petroleum, consumption, biomass, is, already, an, important, source, of, energy, for, the, north, american, forest, products, industry, it, is, common, for, companies, to, have, cogeneration, facilities, also, known, as, combined, heat, and, power, which, convert, some, of, the, biomass, that, results, from, wood, and, paper, manufacturing, to, electrical, and, thermal, energy, in, the, form, of, steam, the, electricity, is, used, to, among, other, things, dry, lumber, and, supply, heat, to, the, dryers, used, in, paper, making, lumber, is, a, sustainable, and, environmentally, friendly, construction, material, that, could, replace, modern, building, materials, e, g, concrete, and, steel, given, its, structural, performance, capacity, to, fixate, co, 2, and, low, energy, demand, during, the, manufacturing, process, substituting, lumber, for, concrete, or, steel, avoids, the, carbon, emissions, of, those, materials, cement, and, concrete, manufacture, is, responsible, for, around, 8, of, global, ghg, emissions, while, the, iron, and, steel, industry, is, responsible, for, another, 5, half, a, ton, of, co, 2, is, emitted, to, manufacture, a, ton, of, concrete, two, tons, of, co, 2, are, emitted, in, the, manufacture, of, a, ton, of, steel, advantages, of, lumber, an, epa, study, showed, the, typical, end, of, life, scenario, for, wood, waste, from, municipal, solid, waste, msw, wood, packaging, and, other, miscellaneous, wood, products, in, the, us, based, on, the, 2018, data, about, 67, of, wood, waste, was, landfilled, 16, incinerated, with, energy, recovery, and, 17, recycled, a, 2020, study, conducted, by, edinburgh, napier, university, demonstrated, the, proportional, waste, stream, of, recovered, lumber, in, the, uk, the, study, showed, that, timber, from, municipal, solid, waste, and, packaging, waste, made, up, 13, and, 26, of, waste, collected, construction, and, demolition, waste, made, up, the, biggest, bulk, of, waste, collectively, at, 52, with, the, remaining, 10, coming, from, industry, the, ellen, macarthur, foundation, defines, the, circular, economy, as, based, on, the, principles, of, designing, out, waste, and, pollution, keeping, products, and, materials, in, use, and, regenerating, natural, systems, the, circular, economy, can, be, considered, as, a, model, that, aims, to, eliminate, waste, by, targeting, materials, and, products, at, their, maximum, value, of, utility, and, time, in, short, it, is, a, whole, new, model, of, production, and, consumption, that, ensures, sustainable, development, over, time, it, is, related, to, the, reuse, of, materials, components, and, products, over, a, longer, life, cycle, wood, is, among, the, most, demanding, materials, which, makes, it, important, to, come, up, with, a, model, of, the, circular, economy, the, lumber, industry, creates, a, lot, of, waste, especially, in, its, manufacturing, process, from, log, debarking, to, finished, products, there, are, several, stages, of, processing, that, generate, a, considerable, volume, of, waste, which, includes, solid, wood, waste, harmful, gases, and, residual, water, therefore, it, is, important, to, identify, and, apply, measures, to, reduce, environmental, contamination, giving, a, financial, return, to, the, industries, e, g, selling, the, waste, to, wood, chippings, manufacturers, and, maintaining, a, healthy, relationship, between, the, environment, and, industries, wood, waste, can, be, recycled, at, its, end, of, life, to, make, new, products, recycled, chips, can, be, used, to, make, wood, panels, which, is, beneficial, for, both, the, environment, and, industry, such, practice, reduces, the, use, of, virgin, raw, materials, eliminating, emissions, that, would, have, otherwise, been, emitted, in, its, manufacturing, one, of, the, studies, conducted, in, hong, kong, was, done, using, life, cycle, assessment, lca, the, study, aimed, to, assess, and, compare, the, environmental, impacts, of, wood, waste, management, from, building, construction, activities, using, different, alternative, management, scenarios, in, hong, kong, despite, various, advantages, of, lumber, and, its, waste, the, contribution, to, the, study, of, the, circular, economy, of, lumber, is, still, very, small, some, areas, where, improvements, can, be, made, to, improve, the, circularity, of, lumber, is, as, follows, the, term, secondary, raw, material, denotes, waste, material, that, has, been, recycled, and, injected, back, into, use, as, productive, material, lumber, has, a, high, potential, to, be, used, as, a, secondary, raw, material, at, various, stages, as, listed, below, circular, economy, practices, offer, effective, solutions, concerning, waste, it, targets, its, unnecessary, generation, through, waste, reduction, reuse, and, recycling, there, is, no, clear, explicit, evidence, of, circular, economy, in, the, wood, panel, industry, however, based, on, the, circular, economy, concept, and, its, characteristics, there, are, opportunities, present, in, the, wood, panel, industry, from, the, raw, material, extraction, phase, to, its, end, of, life, therefore, there, lies, a, gap, yet, to, be, explored
