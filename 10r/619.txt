space, launch, facility, in, terms, of, area, all, russian, crewed, spaceflights, are, launched, from, baikonur, situated, in, the, kazakh, steppe, some, 90, metres, 300, ft, above, sea, level, it, is, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, to, the, east, of, the, aral, sea, and, north, of, the, syr, darya, it, is, close, to, t, retam, a, station, on, the, trans, aral, railway, russia, as, the, official, successor, state, to, the, soviet, union, has, retained, control, over, the, facility, since, 1991, it, originally, assumed, this, role, through, the, post, soviet, commonwealth, of, independent, states, cis, but, ratified, an, agreement, with, kazakhstan, in, 2005, that, allowed, it, to, lease, the, spaceport, until, 2050, it, is, jointly, managed, by, roscosmos, and, the, russian, aerospace, forces, in, 1955, the, soviet, ministry, of, defence, issued, a, decree, and, founded, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, it, was, originally, built, as, the, chief, base, of, operations, for, the, soviet, space, program, the, cosmodrome, served, as, the, launching, point, for, sputnik, 1, and, vostok, 1, the, launchpad, used, for, both, missions, was, renamed, gagarin, s, start, in, honour, of, soviet, cosmonaut, yuri, gagarin, who, piloted, vostok, 1, and, became, the, first, human, in, outer, space, under, the, current, russian, management, baikonur, remains, a, busy, spaceport, with, numerous, commercial, military, and, scientific, missions, being, launched, annually, the, soviet, government, issued, scientific, research, test, range, no, 5, niip, 5, russian, 5, pyatyy, nauchno, issledovatel, skiy, ispytatel, nyy, poligon, on, 12, february, 1955, it, was, actually, founded, on, 2, june, 1955, originally, a, test, center, for, the, world, s, first, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, icbm, the, r, 7, semyorka, niip, 5, was, soon, expanded, to, include, launch, facilities, for, space, flights, the, site, was, selected, by, a, commission, led, by, general, vasily, voznyuk, influenced, by, sergey, korolyov, the, chief, designer, of, the, r, 7, icbm, and, soon, the, man, behind, the, soviet, space, program, it, had, to, be, surrounded, by, plains, as, the, radio, control, system, of, the, rocket, required, at, the, time, receiving, uninterrupted, signals, from, ground, stations, hundreds, of, kilometres, away, additionally, the, missile, trajectory, had, to, be, away, from, populated, areas, also, it, is, advantageous, to, place, space, launch, sites, closer, to, the, equator, as, the, surface, of, the, earth, has, higher, rotational, speed, in, such, areas, taking, these, constraints, into, consideration, the, commission, chose, tyuratam, a, village, in, the, heart, of, the, kazakh, steppe, the, expense, of, constructing, the, launch, facilities, and, the, several, hundred, kilometres, of, new, road, and, train, lines, made, the, cosmodrome, one, of, the, most, costly, infrastructure, projects, undertaken, by, the, soviet, union, a, supporting, town, was, built, around, the, facility, to, provide, housing, schools, and, infrastructure, for, workers, it, was, raised, to, city, status, in, 1966, and, named, leninsk, russian, the, american, u, 2, high, altitude, reconnaissance, plane, found, and, photographed, the, tyuratam, missile, test, range, for, the, first, time, on, 5, august, 1957, in, april, of, 1975, in, preparation, for, the, apollo, soyuz, test, project, the, first, nasa, astronauts, were, allowed, to, tour, the, cosmodrome, upon, their, return, to, the, united, states, the, crews, commented, that, on, their, evening, flight, to, moscow, they, had, seen, lights, on, launch, pads, and, related, complexes, for, more, than, 15, minutes, and, according, to, astronaut, thomas, stafford, that, makes, cape, kennedy, look, very, small, according, to, most, sources, the, name, baikonur, was, deliberately, chosen, in, 1961, around, the, time, of, gagarin, s, flight, to, misdirect, the, western, bloc, to, a, place, about, 320, kilometres, 200, mi, northeast, of, the, launch, center, the, small, mining, town, and, railway, station, of, baikonur, near, jezkazgan, leninsk, the, closed, city, built, to, support, the, cosmodrome, was, renamed, baikonur, on, 20, december, 1995, by, boris, yeltsin, according, to, nasa, s, history, of, the, apollo, soyuz, test, project, the, name, baikonur, was, not, chosen, to, misdirect, but, was, the, name, of, the, tyuratam, region, before, the, establishment, of, the, cosmodrome, russian, scientist, afanasiy, ilich, tobonov, researched, mass, animal, deaths, in, the, 1990s, and, concluded, that, the, mass, deaths, of, birds, and, wildlife, in, the, sakha, republic, were, noted, only, along, the, flight, paths, of, space, rockets, launched, from, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, dead, wildlife, and, livestock, were, usually, incinerated, and, the, participants, in, these, incinerations, including, tobonov, himself, his, brothers, and, inhabitants, of, his, native, village, of, eliptyan, commonly, died, from, stroke, or, cancer, in, 1997, the, ministry, of, defense, of, the, russian, federation, changed, the, flight, path, and, removed, the, ejected, rocket, stages, near, nyurbinsky, district, russia, scientific, literature, collected, data, that, indicated, adverse, effects, of, rockets, on, the, environment, and, the, health, of, the, population, udmh, a, fuel, used, in, russian, rocket, engines, is, highly, toxic, it, is, one, of, the, reasons, for, acid, rains, and, cancers, in, the, local, population, near, the, cosmodrome, valery, yakovlev, a, head, of, the, laboratory, of, ecosystem, research, of, the, state, scientific, production, union, of, applied, ecology, kazmechanobr, notes, scientists, have, established, the, extreme, character, of, the, destructive, influence, of, the, baikonur, space, center, on, environment, and, population, of, the, region, 11, 000, tons, of, space, scrap, metal, polluted, by, especially, toxic, udmh, is,

on, 12, april, 1961, and, the, flight, of, the, first, woman, in, space, valentina, tereshkova, in, 1963, 14, cosmonauts, of, 13, other, nations, including, czechoslovakia, east, germany, india, and, france, have, launched, from, baikonur, under, the, interkosmos, program, as, well, in, 1960, a, prototype, r, 16, icbm, exploded, before, launch, killing, over, 100, people, baikonur, is, also, the, site, from, which, venera, 9, and, mars, 3, were, launched, following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, russian, space, program, continued, to, operate, from, baikonur, under, the, auspices, of, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, russia, wanted, to, sign, a, 99, year, lease, for, baikonur, but, agreed, to, a, us, 115, million, annual, lease, of, the, site, for, 20, years, with, an, option, for, a, 10, year, extension, on, 8, june, 2005, the, russian, federation, council, ratified, an, agreement, between, russia, and, kazakhstan, extending, russia, s, rent, term, of, the, spaceport, until, 2050, the, rent, price, which, remained, fixed, at, us, 115, 000, 000, per, year, is, the, source, of, a, long, running, dispute, between, the, two, countries, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, its, dependency, on, baikonur, russia, built, the, vostochny, cosmodrome, in, amur, oblast, baikonur, has, been, a, major, part, of, russia, s, contribution, to, the, international, space, station, iss, as, it, is, the, only, spaceport, from, which, russian, missions, to, the, iss, are, launched, it, is, primarily, the, border, s, position, but, to, a, lesser, extent, baikonur, s, position, at, about, the, 46th, parallel, north, that, led, to, the, 51, 6, orbital, inclination, of, the, iss, the, lowest, inclination, that, can, be, reached, by, soyuz, boosters, launched, from, baikonur, without, flying, over, china, with, the, conclusion, of, nasa, s, space, shuttle, program, in, 2011, baikonur, became, the, sole, launch, site, used, for, crewed, missions, to, the, iss, until, the, launch, of, crew, dragon, demo, 2, in, 2020, in, 2019, gagarin, s, start, hosted, three, crewed, launches, in, march, july, and, september, before, being, shut, down, for, modernisation, for, the, new, soyuz, 2, rocket, with, a, planned, first, launch, in, 2023, the, final, launch, from, gagarin, s, start, took, place, 25, september, 2019, gagarin, s, start, failed, to, receive, funding, in, part, due, to, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, to, modernize, it, for, the, slightly, larger, soyuz, 2, rocket, in, 2023, it, was, announced, that, the, russian, and, kazakhstan, authorities, plan, to, deactivate, the, site, as, a, space, launch, pad, and, turn, it, into, a, museum, in, part, for, tourism, purposes, on, 7, march, 2023, the, kazakh, government, seized, control, of, the, baiterek, launch, complex, one, of, the, launch, sites, at, baikonur, cosmodrome, banning, numerous, russian, officials, from, leaving, the, country, and, preventing, the, liquidation, of, assets, by, roscosmos, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, seizure, was, due, to, russia, failing, to, pay, a, 29, 7, million, debt, to, the, kazakh, government, the, seizure, comes, after, russia, s, relations, with, kazakhstan, became, tense, due, to, its, ongoing, invasion, of, ukraine, baikonur, is, fully, equipped, with, facilities, for, launching, both, crewed, and, uncrewed, spacecraft, it, has, supported, several, generations, of, russian, spacecraft, soyuz, proton, tsyklon, dnepr, zenit, and, buran, downrange, from, the, launchpad, spent, launch, equipment, is, dropped, directly, on, the, ground, in, the, russian, far, east, where, it, is, salvaged, by, the, workers, and, the, local, population, as, part, of, the, buran, programme, several, facilities, were, adapted, or, newly, built, for, the, buran, class, space, shuttle, orbiters, all, baikonur, s, logistics, are, based, on, its, own, intra, site, 1, 520, mm, 4, ft, 11, 27, 32, in, gauge, railway, network, which, is, the, largest, industrial, railway, on, the, planet, the, railway, is, used, for, all, stages, of, launch, preparation, and, all, spacecraft, are, transported, to, the, launchpads, by, the, special, schnabel, cars, once, part, of, the, soviet, railroad, troops, the, baikonur, railway, is, now, served, by, a, dedicated, civilian, state, company, there, are, several, rail, links, connecting, the, baikonur, railway, to, the, public, railway, of, kazakhstan, and, the, rest, of, the, world, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, has, two, on, site, multi, purpose, airports, serving, both, the, personnel, transportation, needs, and, the, logistics, of, space, launches, including, the, delivery, of, the, spacecraft, by, planes, there, are, scheduled, passenger, services, from, moscow, to, the, smaller, krayniy, airport, iata, bxy, icao, uaol, which, however, are, not, accessible, to, the, public, the, larger, yubileyniy, airport, iata, uaon, was, where, the, buran, orbiter, was, transported, to, baikonur, on, the, back, of, the, antonov, an, 225, mriya, cargo, aircraft, although, baikonur, has, always, been, known, around, the, world, as, the, launch, site, of, soviet, and, russian, space, missions, from, its, outset, in, 1955, and, until, the, collapse, of, the, ussr, in, 1991, the, primary, purpose, of, this, center, was, to, test, liquid, fueled, ballistic, missiles, the, official, and, secret, name, of, the, center, was, state, test, range, no, 5, or, 5, gik, it, remained, under, the, control, of, the, soviet, and, russian, ministry, of, defense, until, the, second, half, of, the, 1990s, when, the, russian, civilian, space, agency, and, its, industrial, contractors, started, taking, over, individual, facilities, in, 2006, the, head, of, roscosmos, anatoly, perminov, said, that, the, last, russian, military, personnel, would, be, removed, from, the, baikonur, facility, by, 2007, however, on, 22, october, 2008, an, ss, 19, stiletto, missile, was, test, fired, from, baikonur, indicating, this, may, not, be, the, case, on, 22, december, 2004, kazakhstan, and, russia, signed, a, contract, establishing, the, russia, kazakhstan, baiterek, jv, joint, venture, in, which, each, country, holds, a, 50, stake, the, goal, of, the, project, is, the, construction, of, the, bayterek, poplar, tree, space, launch, complex, to, facilitate, operations, of, the, russian, angara, rocket, launcher, this, will, allow, launches, with, a, payload, of, 26, tons, to, low, earth, orbit, compared, to, 20, tons, using, the, proton, system, an, additional, benefit, will, be, that, the, angara, uses, kerosene, as, fuel, and, oxygen, as, the, oxidiser, which, is, less, hazardous, to, the, environment, than, the, toxic, fuels, used, by, older, boosters, the, total, expenditure, on, the, kazakh, side, will, be, us, 223, million, over, 19, years, as, of, 2010, the, project, was, stalling, due, to, insufficient, funding, it, was, thought, that, the, project, still, had, good, chances, to, succeed, because, it, will, allow, both, parties, russia, and, kazakhstan, to, continue, the, joint, use, of, baikonur, even, after, the, vostochny, cosmodrome, is, commissioned, the, first, scheduled, launch, of, the, baiterek, rocket, and, space, complex, is, scheduled, for, 2025, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, has, a, small, museum, next, to, two, small, cottages, once, residences, of, the, rocket, engineer, sergei, korolev, and, the, first, cosmonaut, yuri, gagarin, both, cottages, are, part, of, the, museum, complex, and, have, been, preserved, the, museum, is, home, to, a, collection, of, space, artefacts, a, restored, test, article, from, the, soviet, buran, programme, sits, next, to, the, museum, entrance, the, only, completed, orbiter, which, flew, a, single, orbital, test, mission, in, 1988, was, destroyed, in, a, hangar, collapse, in, 2002, for, a, complete, list, of, surviving, buran, vehicles, and, artefacts, see, buran, programme, list, of, vehicles, the, museum, also, houses, photographs, related, to, the, cosmodrome, s, history, including, images, of, all, cosmonauts, every, crew, of, every, expedition, launched, from, baikonur, leaves, behind, a, signed, crew, photograph, that, is, displayed, behind, the, glass, baikonur, s, museum, holds, many, objects, related, to, gagarin, including, the, ground, control, panel, from, his, flight, his, uniforms, and, soil, from, his, landing, site, preserved, in, a, silver, container, one, of, the, museum, rooms, also, holds, an, older, version, of, the, soyuz, descent, capsule, in, 2021, the, baikonur, space, complex, was, named, as, one, of, the, top, 10, tourist, destinations, in, kazakhstan, in, 2023, a, plan, was, announced, to, add, the, gagarin, s, start, launch, complex, to, the, museum, complex, at, baikonur, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, was, featured, prominently, in, the, 2010, video, game, call, of, duty, black, ops, in, one,
