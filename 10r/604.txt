the, planet, mars, has, been, explored, remotely, by, spacecraft, probes, sent, from, earth, beginning, in, the, late, 20th, century, have, yielded, a, large, increase, in, knowledge, about, the, martian, system, focused, primarily, on, understanding, its, geology, and, habitability, potential, engineering, interplanetary, journeys, is, complicated, and, the, exploration, of, mars, has, experienced, a, high, failure, rate, especially, the, early, attempts, roughly, sixty, percent, of, all, spacecraft, destined, for, mars, failed, before, completing, their, missions, with, some, failing, before, their, observations, could, begin, some, missions, have, been, met, with, unexpected, success, such, as, the, twin, mars, exploration, rovers, spirit, and, opportunity, which, operated, for, years, beyond, their, specification, there, are, two, functional, rovers, on, the, surface, of, mars, the, curiosity, and, perseverance, rovers, both, operated, by, the, american, space, agency, nasa, perseverance, was, accompanied, by, the, ingenuity, helicopter, which, scouted, sites, for, perseverance, to, study, before, its, mission, ended, in, 2024, the, zhurong, rover, part, of, the, tianwen, 1, mission, by, the, china, national, space, administration, cnsa, was, active, until, 20, may, 2022, when, it, went, into, hibernation, due, to, approaching, sandstorms, and, martian, winter, the, rover, was, expected, to, awaken, from, hibernation, in, december, 2022, but, as, of, april, 2023, it, has, not, moved, and, is, presumed, to, be, permanently, inactive, there, are, seven, orbiters, surveying, the, planet, mars, odyssey, mars, express, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, maven, the, trace, gas, orbiter, the, hope, mars, mission, and, the, tianwen, 1, orbiter, which, have, contributed, massive, amounts, of, information, about, mars, thus, there, are, nine, total, vehicles, currently, exploring, mars, 2, rovers, and, 7, orbiters, various, mars, sample, return, missions, are, being, planned, like, nasa, esa, mars, sample, return, that, will, pick, up, the, samples, currently, being, collected, by, the, perseverance, rover, the, next, missions, expected, to, arrive, at, mars, are, in, april, 2024, nasa, selected, several, companies, to, begin, studies, on, providing, commercial, services, to, further, enable, robotic, science, on, mars, mars, has, long, been, the, subject, of, human, interest, early, telescopic, observations, revealed, color, changes, on, the, surface, that, were, attributed, to, seasonal, vegetation, and, apparent, linear, features, were, ascribed, to, intelligent, design, further, telescopic, observations, found, two, moons, phobos, and, deimos, polar, ice, caps, and, the, feature, now, known, as, olympus, mons, the, solar, system, s, tallest, mountain, the, discoveries, piqued, further, interest, in, the, study, and, exploration, of, the, red, planet, mars, is, a, rocky, planet, like, earth, that, formed, around, the, same, time, yet, with, only, half, the, diameter, of, earth, and, a, thin, atmosphere, it, has, a, cold, and, desert, like, surface, one, way, the, surface, of, mars, has, been, categorized, is, by, thirty, quadrangles, with, each, quadrangle, named, for, a, prominent, physiographic, feature, within, that, quadrangle, the, minimum, energy, launch, windows, for, a, martian, expedition, occur, at, intervals, of, approximately, two, years, and, two, months, specifically, 780, days, the, planet, s, synodic, period, with, respect, to, earth, in, addition, the, lowest, available, transfer, energy, varies, on, a, roughly, 16, year, cycle, for, example, a, minimum, occurred, in, the, 1969, and, 1971, launch, windows, rising, to, a, peak, in, the, late, 1970s, and, hitting, another, low, in, 1986, and, 1988, 2, impulse, relativity, mars, lander, 2029, starting, in, 1960, the, soviet, space, program, launched, a, series, of, probes, to, mars, including, the, first, intended, flybys, and, hard, impact, landing, mars, 1962b, the, first, successful, flyby, of, mars, was, on, 14, 15, july, 1965, by, nasa, s, mariner, 4, on, november, 14, 1971, mariner, 9, became, the, first, space, probe, to, orbit, another, planet, when, it, entered, into, orbit, around, mars, the, amount, of, data, returned, by, probes, increased, substantially, as, technology, improved, the, first, to, contact, the, surface, were, two, soviet, probes, mars, 2, lander, on, november, 27, and, mars, 3, lander, on, december, 2, 1971, mars, 2, failed, during, descent, and, mars, 3, failed, about, twenty, seconds, after, the, first, martian, soft, landing, mars, 6, failed, during, descent, but, did, return, some, corrupted, atmospheric, data, in, 1974, the, 1975, nasa, launches, of, the, viking, program, consisted, of, two, orbiters, each, with, a, lander, that, successfully, soft, landed, in, 1976, viking, 1, remained, operational, for, six, years, viking, 2, for, three, years, the, viking, landers, relayed, the, first, color, panoramas, of, mars, the, soviet, probes, phobos, 1, and, 2, were, sent, to, mars, in, 1988, to, study, mars, and, its, two, moons, with, a, focus, on, phobos, phobos, 1, lost, contact, on, the, way, to, mars, phobos, 2, while, successfully, photographing, mars, and, phobos, failed, before, it, was, set, to, release, two, landers, to, the, surface, of, phobos, mars, has, a, reputation, as, a, difficult, space, exploration, target, just, 25, of, 55, missions, through, 2019, or, 45, 5, have, been, fully, successful, with, a, further, three, partially, successful, and, partially, failures, however, of, the, sixteen, missions, since, 2001, twelve, have, been, successful, and, eight, of, these, remain, operational, missions, that, ended, prematurely, after, phobos, 1, and, 2, 1988, include, see, probe, difficulties, section, for, more, details, following, the, 1993, failure, of, the, mars, observer, orbiter, the, nasa, mars, global, surveyor, achieved, mars, orbit, in, 1997, this, mission, was, a, complete, success, having, finished, its, primary, mapping, mission, in, early, 2001, contact, was, lost, with, the, probe, in, november, 2006, during, its, third, extended, program, spending, exactly, 10, operational, years, in, space, the, nasa, mars, pathfinder, carrying, a, robotic, exploration, vehicle, sojourner, landed, in, the, ares, vallis, on, mars, in, the, summer, of, 1997, returning, many, images, nasa, s, mars, odyssey, orbiter, entered, mars, orbit, in, 2001, odyssey, s, gamma, ray, spectrometer, detected, significant, amounts, of, hydrogen, in, the, upper, metre, or, so, of, regolith, on, mars, this, hydrogen, is, thought, to, be, contained, in, large, deposits, of, water, ice, the, mars, express, mission, of, the, european, space, agency, esa, reached, mars, in, 2003, it, carried, the, beagle, 2, lander, which, was, not, heard, from, after, being, released, and, was, declared, lost, in, february, 2004, beagle, 2, was, located, in, january, 2015, by, the, hirise, camera, on, nasa, s, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, mro, having, landed, safely, but, failed, to, fully, deploy, its, solar, panels, and, antenna, in, early, 2004, the, mars, express, planetary, fourier, spectrometer, team, announced, the, orbiter, had, detected, methane, in, the, martian, atmosphere, a, potential, biosignature, esa, announced, in, june, 2006, the, discovery, of, aurorae, on, mars, by, the, mars, express, in, january, 2004, the, nasa, twin, mars, exploration, rovers, named, spirit, mer, a, and, opportunity, mer, b, landed, on, the, surface, of, mars, both, have, met, and, exceeded, all, their, science, objectives, among, the, most, significant, scientific, returns, has, been, conclusive, evidence, that, liquid, water, existed, at, some, time, in, the, past, at, both, landing, sites, martian, dust, devils, and, windstorms, have, occasionally, cleaned, both, rovers, solar, panels, and, thus, increased, their, lifespan, spirit, rover, mer, a, was, active, until, 2010, when, it, stopped, sending, data, because, it, got, stuck, in, a, sand, dune, and, was, unable, to, reorient, itself, to, recharge, its, batteries, rosetta, came, within, 250, km, of, mars, during, its, 2007, flyby, dawn, flew, by, mars, in, february, 2009, for, a, gravity, assist, on, its, way, to, investigate, vesta, and, ceres, phoenix, landed, on, the, north, polar, region, of, mars, on, may, 25, 2008, its, robotic, arm, dug, into, the, martian, soil, and, the, presence, of, water, ice, was, confirmed, on, june, 20, 2008, the, mission, concluded, on, november, 10, 2008, after, contact, was, lost, in, 2008, the, price, of, transporting, material, from, the, surface, of, earth, to, the, surface, of, mars, was, approximately, us, 309, 000, per, kilogram, the, indian, space, research, organisation, isro, launched, their, mars, orbiter, mission, mom, on, november, 5, 2013, and, it, was, inserted, into, mars, orbit, on, september, 24, 2014, india, s, isro, is, the, fourth, space, agency, to, reach, mars, after, the, soviet, space, program, nasa, and, esa, india, successfully, placed, a, spacecraft, into, mars, orbit, and, became, the, first, country, to, do, so, in, its, maiden, attempt, the, following, entails, a, brief, overview, of, previous, missions, to, mars, oriented, towards, orbiters, and, flybys, see, also, mars, landing, and, mars, rover, between, 1960, and, 1969, the, soviet, union, launched, nine, probes, intended, to, reach, mars, they, all, failed, three, at, launch, three, failed, to, reach, near, earth, orbit, one, during, the, burn, to, put, the, spacecraft, into, trans, mars, trajectory, and, two, during, the, interplanetary, orbit, the, mars, 1m, programs, sometimes, dubbed, marsnik, in, western, media, was, the, first, soviet, uncrewed, spacecraft, interplanetary, exploration, program, which, consisted, of, two, flyby, probes, launched, towards, mars, in, october, 1960, mars, 1960a, and, mars, 1960b, also, known, as, korabl, 4, and, korabl, 5, respectively, after, launch, the, third, stage, pumps, on, both, launchers, were, unable, to, develop, enough, pressure, to, commence, ignition, so, earth, parking, orbit, was, not, achieved, the, spacecraft, reached, an, altitude, of, 120, km, before, reentry, mars, 1962a, was, a, mars, flyby, mission, launched, on, october, 24, 1962, and, mars, 1962b, an, intended, first, mars, lander, mission, launched, in, late, december, of, the, same, year, 1962, both, failed, from, either, breaking, up, as, they, were, going, into, earth, orbit, or, having, the, upper, stage, explode, in, orbit, during, the, burn, to, put, the, spacecraft, into, trans, mars, trajectory, mars, 1, 1962, beta, nu, 1, an, automatic, interplanetary, spacecraft, launched, to, mars, on, november, 1, 1962, was, the, first, probe, of, the, soviet, mars, probe, program, to, achieve, interplanetary, orbit, mars, 1, was, intended, to, fly, by, the, planet, at, a, distance, of, about, 11, 000, km, and, take, images, of, the, surface, as, well, as, send, back, data, on, cosmic, radiation, micrometeoroid, impacts, and, mars, magnetic, field, radiation, environment, atmospheric, structure, and, possible, organic, compounds, sixty, one, radio, transmissions, were, held, initially, at, 2, day, intervals, and, later, at, 5, day, intervals, from, which, a, large, amount, of, interplanetary, data, was, collected, on, 21, march, 1963, when, the, spacecraft, was, at, a, distance, of, 106, 760, 000, km, from, earth, on, its, way, to, mars, communications, ceased, due, to, failure, of, its, antenna, orientation, system, in, 1964, both, soviet, probe, launches, of, zond, 1964a, on, june, 4, and, zond, 2, on, november, 30, part, of, the, zond, program, resulted, in, failures, zond, 1964a, had, a, failure, at, launch, while, communication, was, lost, with, zond, 2, en, route, to, mars, after, a, mid, course, maneuver, in, early, may, 1965, in, 1969, and, as, part, of, the, mars, probe, program, the, soviet, union, prepared, two, identical, 5, ton, orbiters, called, m, 69, dubbed, by, nasa, as, mars, 1969a, and, mars, 1969b, both, probes, were, lost, in, launch, related, complications, with, the, newly, developed, proton, rocket, the, ussr, intended, to, have, the, first, artificial, satellite, of, mars, beating, the, planned, american, mariner, 8, and, mariner, 9, mars, orbiters, in, may, 1971, one, day, after, mariner, 8, malfunctioned, at, launch, and, failed, to, reach, orbit, cosmos, 419, mars, 1971c, a, heavy, probe, of, the, soviet, mars, program, m, 71, also, failed, to, launch, this, spacecraft, was, designed, as, an, orbiter, only, while, the, next, two, probes, of, project, m, 71, mars, 2, and, mars, 3, were, multipurpose, combinations, of, an, orbiter, and, a, lander, with, small, skis, walking, rovers, prop, m, that, would, be, the, first, planet, rovers, outside, the, moon, they, were, successfully, launched, in, mid, may, 1971, and, reached, mars, about, seven, months, later, on, november, 27, 1971, the, lander, of, mars, 2, crash, landed, due, to, an, on, board, computer, malfunction, and, became, the, first, man, made, object, to, reach, the, surface, of, mars, on, 2, december, 1971, the, mars, 3, lander, became, the, first, spacecraft, to, achieve, a, soft, landing, but, its, transmission, was, interrupted, after, 14, 5, seconds, the, mars, 2, and, 3, orbiters, sent, back, a, relatively, large, volume, of, data, covering, the, period, from, december, 1971, to, march, 1972, although, transmissions, continued, through, to, august, by, 22, august, 1972, after, sending, back, data, and, a, total, of, 60, pictures, mars, 2, and, 3, concluded, their, missions, the, images, and, data, enabled, creation, of, surface, relief, maps, and, gave, information, on, the, martian, gravity, and, magnetic, fields, in, 1973, the, soviet, union, sent, four, more, probes, to, mars, the, mars, 4, and, mars, 5, orbiters, and, the, mars, 6, and, mars, 7, flyby, lander, combinations, all, missions, except, mars, 7, sent, back, data, with, mars, 5, being, most, successful, mars, 5, transmitted, just, 60, images, before, a, loss, of, pressurization, in, the, transmitter, housing, ended, the, mission, mars, 6, lander, transmitted, data, during, descent, but, failed, upon, impact, mars, 4, flew, by, the, planet, at, a, range, of, 2200, km, returning, one, swath, of, pictures, and, radio, occultation, data, which, constituted, the, first, detection, of, the, nightside, ionosphere, on, mars, mars, 7, probe, separated, prematurely, from, the, carrying, vehicle, due, to, a, problem, in, the, operation, of, one, of, the, onboard, systems, attitude, control, or, retro, rockets, and, missed, the, planet, by, 1, 300, kilometres, 8, 7, 10, 6, au, in, 1964, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, made, two, attempts, at, reaching, mars, mariner, 3, and, mariner, 4, were, identical, spacecraft, designed, to, carry, out, the, first, flybys, of, mars, mariner, 3, was, launched, on, november, 5, 1964, but, the, shroud, encasing, the, spacecraft, atop, its, rocket, failed, to, open, properly, dooming, the, mission, three, weeks, later, on, november, 28, 1964, mariner, 4, was, launched, successfully, on, a, 7, 1, 2, month, voyage, to, mars, mariner, 4, flew, past, mars, on, july, 14, 1965, providing, the, first, close, up, photographs, of, another, planet, the, pictures, gradually, played, back, to, earth, from, a, small, tape, recorder, on, the, probe, showed, impact, craters, it, provided, radically, more, accurate, data, about, the, planet, a, surface, atmospheric, pressure, of, about, 1, of, earth, s, and, daytime, temperatures, of, 100, c, 148, f, were, estimated, no, magnetic, field, or, martian, radiation, belts, were, detected, the, new, data, meant, redesigns, for, then, planned, martian, landers, and, showed, life, would, have, a, more, difficult, time, surviving, there, than, previously, anticipated, nasa, continued, the, mariner, program, with, another, pair, of, mars, flyby, probes, mariner, 6, and, 7, they, were, sent, at, the, next, launch, window, and, reached, the, planet, in, 1969, during, the, following, launch, window, the, mariner, program, again, suffered, the, loss, of, one, of, a, pair, of, probes, mariner, 9, successfully, entered, orbit, about, mars, the, first, spacecraft, ever, to, do, so, after, the, launch, time, failure, of, its, sister, ship, mariner, 8, when, mariner, 9, reached, mars, in, 1971, it, and, two, soviet, orbiters, mars, 2, and, mars, 3, found, that, a, planet, wide, dust, storm, was, in, progress, the, mission, controllers, used, the, time, spent, waiting, for, the, storm, to, clear, to, have, the, probe, rendezvous, with, and, photograph, phobos, when, the, storm, cleared, sufficiently, for, mars, surface, to, be, photographed, by, mariner, 9, the, pictures, returned, represented, a, substantial, advance, over, previous, missions, these, pictures, were, the, first, to, offer, more, detailed, evidence, that, liquid, water, might, at, one, time, have, flowed, on, the, planetary, surface, they, also, finally, discerned, the, true, nature, of, many, martian, albedo, features, for, example, nix, olympica, was, one, of, only, a, few, features, that, could, be, seen, during, the, planetary, duststorm, revealing, it, to, be, the, highest, mountain, volcano, to, be, exact, on, any, planet, in, the, entire, solar, system, and, leading, to, its, reclassification, as, olympus, mons, the, viking, program, launched, viking, 1, and, viking, 2, spacecraft, to, mars, in, 1975, the, program, consisted, of, two, orbiters, and, two, landers, these, were, the, second, and, third, spacecraft, to, successfully, land, on, mars, the, primary, scientific, objectives, of, the, lander, mission, were, to, search, for, biosignatures, and, observe, meteorologic, seismic, and, magnetic, properties, of, mars, the, results, of, the, biological, experiments, on, board, the, viking, landers, remain, inconclusive, with, a, reanalysis, of, the, viking, data, published, in, 2012, suggesting, signs, of, microbial, life, on, mars, the, viking, orbiters, revealed, that, large, floods, of, water, carved, deep, valleys, eroded, grooves, into, bedrock, and, traveled, thousands, of, kilometers, areas, of, branched, streams, in, the, southern, hemisphere, suggest, that, rain, once, fell, mars, pathfinder, was, a, u, s, spacecraft, that, landed, a, base, station, with, a, roving, probe, on, mars, on, july, 4, 1997, it, consisted, of, a, lander, and, a, small, 10, 6, kilogram, 23, lb, wheeled, robotic, rover, named, sojourner, which, was, the, first, rover, to, operate, on, the, surface, of, mars, in, addition, to, scientific, objectives, the, mars, pathfinder, mission, was, also, a, proof, of, concept, for, various, technologies, such, as, an, airbag, landing, system, and, automated, obstacle, avoidance, both, later, exploited, by, the, mars, exploration, rovers, after, the, 1992, failure, of, nasa, s, mars, observer, orbiter, nasa, retooled, and, launched, mars, global, surveyor, mgs, mars, global, surveyor, launched, on, november, 7, 1996, and, entered, orbit, on, september, 12, 1997, after, a, year, and, a, half, trimming, its, orbit, from, a, looping, ellipse, to, a, circular, track, around, the, planet, the, spacecraft, began, its, primary, mapping, mission, in, march, 1999, it, observed, the, planet, from, a, low, altitude, nearly, polar, orbit, over, the, course, of, one, complete, martian, year, the, equivalent, of, nearly, two, earth, years, mars, global, surveyor, completed, its, primary, mission, on, january, 31, 2001, and, completed, several, extended, mission, phases, until, communication, was, lost, in, 2007, the, mission, studied, the, entire, martian, surface, atmosphere, and, interior, and, returned, more, data, about, the, red, planet, than, all, previous, mars, missions, combined, the, data, has, been, archived, and, remains, available, publicly, among, key, scientific, findings, global, surveyor, took, pictures, of, gullies, and, debris, flow, features, that, suggest, there, may, be, current, sources, of, liquid, water, similar, to, an, aquifer, at, or, near, the, surface, of, the, planet, similar, channels, on, earth, are, formed, by, flowing, water, but, on, mars, the, temperature, is, normally, too, cold, and, the, atmosphere, too, thin, to, sustain, liquid, water, nevertheless, many, scientists, hypothesize, that, liquid, groundwater, can, sometimes, surface, on, mars, erode, gullies, and, channels, and, pool, at, the, bottom, before, freezing, and, evaporating, magnetometer, readings, showed, that, the, planet, s, magnetic, field, is, not, globally, generated, in, the, planet, s, core, but, is, localized, in, particular, areas, of, the, crust, new, temperature, data, and, closeup, images, of, the, martian, moon, phobos, showed, that, its, surface, is, composed, of, powdery, material, at, least, 1, metre, 3, feet, thick, caused, by, millions, of, years, of, meteoroid, impacts, data, from, the, spacecraft, s, laser, altimeter, gave, scientists, their, first, 3, d, views, of, mars, north, polar, ice, cap, in, january, 1999, faulty, software, uploaded, to, the, vehicle, in, june, 2006, caused, the, spacecraft, to, orient, its, solar, panels, incorrectly, several, months, later, resulting, in, battery, overheating, and, subsequent, failure, on, november, 5, 2006, mgs, lost, contact, with, earth, nasa, ended, efforts, to, restore, communication, on, january, 28, 2007, in, 2001, nasa, s, mars, odyssey, orbiter, arrived, at, mars, its, mission, is, to, use, spectrometers, and, imagers, to, hunt, for, evidence, of, past, or, present, water, and, volcanic, activity, on, mars, in, 2002, it, was, announced, that, the, probe, s, gamma, ray, spectrometer, and, neutron, spectrometer, had, detected, large, amounts, of, hydrogen, indicating, that, there, are, vast, deposits, of, water, ice, in, the, upper, three, meters, of, mars, soil, within, 60, latitude, of, the, south, pole, on, june, 2, 2003, the, european, space, agency, s, mars, express, set, off, from, baikonur, cosmodrome, to, mars, the, mars, express, craft, consists, of, the, mars, express, orbiter, and, the, stationary, lander, beagle, 2, the, lander, carried, a, digging, device, and, the, smallest, mass, spectrometer, created, to, date, as, well, as, a, range, of, other, devices, on, a, robotic, arm, in, order, to, accurately, analyze, soil, beneath, the, dusty, surface, to, look, for, biosignatures, and, biomolecules, the, orbiter, entered, mars, orbit, on, december, 25, 2003, and, beagle, 2, entered, mars, atmosphere, the, same, day, however, attempts, to, contact, the, lander, failed, communications, attempts, continued, throughout, january, but, beagle, 2, was, declared, lost, in, mid, february, and, a, joint, inquiry, was, launched, by, the, uk, and, esa, the, mars, express, orbiter, confirmed, the, presence, of, water, ice, and, carbon, dioxide, ice, at, the, planet, s, south, pole, while, nasa, had, previously, confirmed, their, presence, at, the, north, pole, of, mars, the, lander, s, fate, remained, a, mystery, until, it, was, located, intact, on, the, surface, of, mars, in, a, series, of, images, from, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, the, images, suggest, that, two, of, the, spacecraft, s, four, solar, panels, failed, to, deploy, blocking, the, spacecraft, s, communications, antenna, beagle, 2, is, the, first, british, and, first, european, probe, to, achieve, a, soft, landing, on, mars, nasa, s, mars, exploration, rover, mission, mer, started, in, 2003, was, a, robotic, space, mission, involving, two, rovers, spirit, mer, a, and, opportunity, mer, b, that, explored, the, martian, surface, geology, the, mission, s, scientific, objective, was, to, search, for, and, characterize, a, wide, range, of, rocks, and, soils, that, hold, clues, to, past, water, activity, on,

programs, james, reuthner, announced, tentative, support, for, the, boeing, affordable, mars, mission, design, including, radiation, shielding, centrifugal, artificial, gravity, in, transit, consumable, resupply, and, a, lander, which, can, return, reuthner, suggested, that, if, adequate, funding, was, forthcoming, the, proposed, mission, would, be, expected, in, the, early, 2030s, on, october, 8, 2015, nasa, published, its, official, plan, for, human, exploration, and, colonization, of, mars, they, called, it, journey, to, mars, the, plan, operates, through, three, distinct, phases, leading, to, fully, sustained, colonization, on, august, 28, 2015, nasa, funded, a, year, long, simulation, to, study, the, effects, of, a, year, long, mars, mission, on, six, scientists, the, scientists, lived, in, a, biodome, on, a, mauna, loa, mountain, in, hawaii, with, limited, connection, to, the, outside, world, and, were, only, allowed, outside, if, they, were, wearing, spacesuits, nasa, s, human, mars, exploration, plans, have, evolved, through, the, nasa, mars, design, reference, missions, a, series, of, design, studies, for, human, exploration, of, mars, in, 2017, the, focus, of, nasa, shifted, to, a, return, to, the, moon, by, 2024, with, the, artemis, program, a, flight, to, mars, could, follow, after, this, project, the, long, term, goal, of, the, private, corporation, spacex, is, the, establishment, of, routine, flights, to, mars, to, enable, colonization, to, this, end, the, company, is, developing, starship, a, spacecraft, capable, of, crew, transportation, to, mars, and, other, celestial, bodies, along, with, its, booster, super, heavy, in, 2017, spacex, announced, plans, to, send, two, uncrewed, starships, to, mars, by, 2022, followed, by, two, more, uncrewed, flights, and, two, crewed, flights, in, 2024, neither, of, these, have, yet, happened, as, of, august, 2024, starship, is, planned, to, have, a, payload, of, at, least, 100, tonnes, and, is, designed, to, use, a, combination, of, aerobraking, and, propulsive, descent, using, fuel, produced, from, a, mars, in, situ, resource, utilization, facility, as, of, 2024, the, starship, development, program, has, seen, multiple, integrated, test, flights, and, is, progressing, towards, full, reusability, spacex, s, plans, involve, the, mass, manufacturing, of, starship, and, initially, sustained, by, resupply, from, earth, and, in, situ, resource, utilization, on, mars, until, the, mars, colony, reaches, full, self, sustainability, any, future, human, mission, to, mars, will, likely, take, place, within, the, optimal, mars, launch, window, which, occurs, every, 26, months, mars, direct, a, low, cost, human, mission, proposed, by, robert, zubrin, founder, of, the, mars, society, would, use, heavy, lift, saturn, v, class, rockets, such, as, the, ares, v, to, skip, orbital, construction, leo, rendezvous, and, lunar, fuel, depots, a, modified, proposal, called, mars, to, stay, involves, not, returning, the, first, immigrant, explorers, immediately, if, ever, see, colonization, of, mars, the, challenge, complexity, and, length, of, mars, missions, have, led, to, many, mission, failures, the, high, failure, rate, of, missions, attempting, to, explore, mars, is, informally, called, the, mars, curse, or, martian, curse, the, phrase, galactic, ghoul, or, great, galactic, ghoul, refers, to, a, fictitious, space, monster, that, subsists, on, a, diet, of, mars, probes, and, is, sometimes, facetiously, used, to, explain, the, recurring, difficulties, two, soviet, probes, were, sent, to, mars, in, 1988, as, part, of, the, phobos, program, phobos, 1, operated, normally, until, an, expected, communications, session, on, 2, september, 1988, failed, to, occur, the, problem, was, traced, to, a, software, error, which, deactivated, phobos, 1, s, attitude, thrusters, causing, the, spacecraft, s, solar, arrays, to, no, longer, point, at, the, sun, depleting, phobos, 1, s, batteries, phobos, 2, operated, normally, throughout, its, cruise, and, mars, orbital, insertion, phases, on, january, 29, 1989, gathering, data, on, the, sun, interplanetary, medium, mars, and, phobos, shortly, before, the, final, phase, of, the, mission, during, which, the, spacecraft, was, to, approach, within, 50, m, of, phobos, surface, and, release, two, landers, one, a, mobile, hopper, the, other, a, stationary, platform, contact, with, phobos, 2, was, lost, the, mission, ended, when, the, spacecraft, signal, failed, to, be, successfully, reacquired, on, march, 27, 1989, the, cause, of, the, failure, was, determined, to, be, a, malfunction, of, the, on, board, computer, just, a, few, years, later, in, 1992, mars, observer, launched, by, nasa, failed, as, it, approached, mars, mars, 96, an, orbiter, launched, on, november, 16, 1996, by, russia, failed, when, the, planned, second, burn, of, the, block, d, 2, fourth, stage, did, not, occur, following, the, success, of, global, surveyor, and, pathfinder, another, spate, of, failures, occurred, in, 1998, and, 1999, with, the, japanese, nozomi, orbiter, and, nasa, s, mars, climate, orbiter, mars, polar, lander, and, deep, space, 2, penetrators, all, suffering, various, fatal, errors, the, mars, climate, orbiter, was, noted, for, mixing, up, u, s, customary, units, with, metric, units, causing, the, orbiter, to, burn, up, while, entering, mars, atmosphere, the, european, space, agency, has, also, attempted, to, land, two, probes, on, the, martian, surface, beagle, 2, a, british, built, lander, that, failed, to, deploy, its, solar, arrays, properly, after, touchdown, in, december, 2003, and, schiaparelli, which, was, flown, along, the, exomars, trace, gas, orbiter, contact, with, the, schiaparelli, edm, lander, was, lost, 50, seconds, before, touchdown, it, was, later, confirmed, that, the, lander, struck, the, surface, at, a, high, velocity, possibly, exploding, solar, system,
