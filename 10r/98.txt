a, router, is, a, computer, and, networking, device, that, forwards, data, packets, between, computer, networks, including, internetworks, such, as, the, global, internet, a, router, is, connected, to, two, or, more, data, lines, from, different, ip, networks, when, a, data, packet, comes, in, on, a, line, the, router, reads, the, network, address, information, in, the, packet, header, to, determine, the, ultimate, destination, then, using, information, in, its, routing, table, or, routing, policy, it, directs, the, packet, to, the, next, network, on, its, journey, data, packets, are, forwarded, from, one, router, to, another, through, an, internetwork, until, it, reaches, its, destination, node, the, most, familiar, type, of, ip, routers, are, home, and, small, office, routers, that, forward, ip, packets, between, the, home, computers, and, the, internet, more, sophisticated, routers, such, as, enterprise, routers, connect, large, business, or, isp, networks, to, powerful, core, routers, that, forward, data, at, high, speed, along, the, optical, fiber, lines, of, the, internet, backbone, routers, can, be, built, from, standard, computer, parts, but, are, mostly, specialized, purpose, built, computers, early, routers, used, software, based, forwarding, running, on, a, cpu, more, sophisticated, devices, use, application, specific, integrated, circuits, asics, to, increase, performance, or, add, advanced, filtering, and, firewall, functionality, when, multiple, routers, are, used, in, interconnected, networks, the, routers, can, exchange, information, about, destination, addresses, using, a, routing, protocol, each, router, builds, up, a, routing, table, a, list, of, routes, between, two, computer, systems, on, the, interconnected, networks, the, software, that, runs, the, router, is, composed, of, two, functional, processing, units, that, operate, simultaneously, called, planes, a, router, may, have, interfaces, for, multiple, types, of, physical, layer, connections, such, as, copper, cables, fiber, optic, or, wireless, transmission, it, can, also, support, multiple, network, layer, transmission, standards, each, network, interface, is, used, to, enable, data, packets, to, be, forwarded, from, one, transmission, system, to, another, routers, may, also, be, used, to, connect, two, or, more, logical, groups, of, computer, devices, known, as, subnets, each, with, a, unique, network, prefix, routers, may, provide, connectivity, within, enterprises, between, enterprises, and, the, internet, or, between, internet, service, providers, isps, networks, they, are, also, responsible, for, directing, data, between, different, networks, the, largest, routers, such, as, the, cisco, crs, 1, or, juniper, ptx, interconnect, the, various, isps, or, may, be, used, in, large, enterprise, networks, smaller, routers, usually, provide, connectivity, for, typical, home, and, office, networks, all, sizes, of, routers, may, be, found, inside, enterprises, the, most, powerful, routers, are, usually, found, in, isps, academic, and, research, facilities, large, businesses, may, also, need, more, powerful, routers, to, cope, with, ever, increasing, demands, of, intranet, data, traffic, a, hierarchical, internetworking, model, for, interconnecting, routers, in, large, networks, is, in, common, use, some, routers, can, connect, to, data, service, units, for, t1, connections, via, serial, ports, the, hierarchical, internetworking, model, divides, enterprise, networks, into, three, layers, core, distribution, and, access, access, routers, including, small, office, home, office, soho, models, are, located, at, home, and, customer, sites, such, as, branch, offices, that, do, not, need, hierarchical, routing, of, their, own, typically, they, are, optimized, for, low, cost, some, soho, routers, are, capable, of, running, alternative, free, linux, based, firmware, like, tomato, openwrt, or, dd, wrt, distribution, routers, aggregate, traffic, from, multiple, access, routers, distribution, routers, are, often, responsible, for, enforcing, quality, of, service, across, a, wide, area, network, wan, so, they, may, have, considerable, memory, installed, multiple, wan, interface, connections, and, substantial, onboard, data, processing, routines, they, may, also, provide, connectivity, to, groups, of, file, servers, or, other, external, networks, in, enterprises, a, core, router, may, provide, a, collapsed, backbone, interconnecting, the, distribution, tier, routers, from, multiple, buildings, of, a, campus, or, large, enterprise, locations, they, tend, to, be, optimized, for, high, bandwidth, but, lack, some, of, the, features, of, edge, routers, external, networks, must, be, carefully, considered, as, part, of, the, overall, security, strategy, of, the, local, network, a, router, may, include, a, firewall, vpn, handling, and, other, security, functions, or, they, may, be, handled, by, separate, devices, routers, also, commonly, perform, network, address, translation, which, restricts, connections, initiated, from, external, connections, but, is, not, recognized, as, a, security, feature, by, all, experts, some, experts, argue, that, open, source, routers, are, more, secure, and, reliable, than, closed, source, routers, because, errors, and, potentially, exploitable, vulnerabilities, are, more, likely, to, be, discovered, and, addressed, in, an, open, source, environment, routers, are, also, often, distinguished, on, the, basis, of, the, network, in, which, they, operate, a, router, in, a, local, area, network, lan, of, a, single, organization, is, called, an, interior, router, a, router, that, is, operated, in, the, internet, backbone, is, described, as, exterior, router, while, a, router, that, connects, a, lan, with, the, internet, or, a, wide, area, network, wan, is, called, a, border, router, or, gateway, router, routers, intended, for, isp, and, major, enterprise, connectivity, usually, exchange, routing, information, using, the, border, gateway, protocol, bgp, rfc, 4098, defines, the, types, of, bgp, routers, according, to, their, functions, wi, fi, routers, combine, the, functions, of, a, router, with, those, of, a, wireless, access, point, they, are, typically, devices, with, a, small, form, factor, operating, on, the, standard, electric, power, supply, for, residential, use, connected, to, the, internet, as, offered, by, an, internet, service, provider, they, provide, internet, access, through, a, wireless, network, for, home, or, office, use, the, concepts, of, a, switching, node, using, software, and, an, interface, computer, were, first, proposed, by, donald, davies, for, the, npl, network, in, 1966, the, same, idea, was, conceived, by, wesley, clark, the, following, year, for, use, in, the, arpanet, which, were, named, interface, message, processors, imps, the, first, interface, computer, was, implemented, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, in, the, united, kingdom, in, early, 1969, followed, later, that, year, by, the, imps, at, the, university, of, california, los, angeles, the, stanford, research, institute, the, university, of, california, santa, barbara, and, the, university, of, utah, school, of, computing, in, the, united, states, all, were, built, with, the, honeywell, 516, these, computers, had, fundamentally, the, same, functionality, as, a, router, does, today, the, idea, for, a, router, called, a, gateway, at, the, time, initially, came, about, through, an, international, group, of, computer, networking, researchers, called, the, international, network, working, group, inwg, these, gateway, devices, were, different, from, most, previous, packet, switching, schemes, in, two, ways, first, they, connected, dissimilar, kinds, of, networks, such, as, serial, lines, and, local, area, networks, second, they, were, connectionless, devices, which, had, no, role, in, assuring, that, traffic, was, delivered, reliably, leaving, that, function, entirely, to, the, hosts, this, particular, idea, the, end, to, end, principle, was, pioneered, in, the, cyclades, network, the, idea, was, explored, in, more, detail, with, the, intention, to, produce, a, prototype, system, as, part, of, two, contemporaneous, programs, one, was, a, program, at, xerox, parc, to, explore, new, networking, technologies, which, produced, the, parc, universal, packet, system, some, time, after, early, 1974, the, first, xerox, routers, became, operational, due, to, corporate, intellectual, property, concerns, it, received, little, attention, outside, xerox, for, years, the, other, was, the, darpa, initiated, program, which, created, the, tcp, ip, architecture, in, use, today, the, first, true, ip, router, was, developed, by, ginny, travers, at, bbn, as, part, of, that, darpa, initiated, effort, during, 1975, 1976, by, the, end, of, 1976, three, pdp, 11, based, routers, were, in, service, in, the, experimental, prototype, internet, mike, brecia, ginny, travers, and, bob, hinden, received, the, ieee, internet, award, for, early, ip, routers, in, 2008, the, first, multiprotocol, routers, were, independently, created, by, staff, researchers, at, mit, and, stanford, in, 1981, and, both, were, also, based, on, pdp, 11s, stanford, s, router, program, was, led, by, william, yeager, and, mit, s, by, noel, chiappa, virtually, all, networking, now, uses, tcp, ip, but, multiprotocol, routers, are, still, manufactured, they, were, important, in, the, early, stages, of, the, growth, of, computer, networking, when, protocols, other, than, tcp, ip, were, in, use, modern, routers, that, handle, both, ipv4, and, ipv6, are, multiprotocol, but, are, simpler, devices, than, ones, processing, appletalk, decnet, ipx, and, xerox, protocols, from, the, mid, 1970s, and, in, the, 1980s, general, purpose, minicomputers, served, as, routers, modern, high, speed, routers, are, network, processors, or, highly, specialized, computers, with, extra, hardware, acceleration, added, to, speed, both, common, routing, functions, such, as, packet, forwarding, and, specialized, functions, such, as, ipsec, encryption, there, is, substantial, use, of, linux, and, unix, software, based, machines, running, open, source, routing, code, for, research, and, other, applications, the, cisco, ios, operating, system, was, independently, designed, major, router, operating, systems, such, as, junos, and, nx, os, are, extensively, modified, versions, of, unix, software, the, main, purpose, of, a, router, is, to, connect, multiple, networks, and, forward, packets, destined, either, for, directly, attached, networks, or, more, remote, networks, a, router, is, considered, a, layer, 3, device, because, its, primary, forwarding, decision, is, based, on, the, information, in, the, layer, 3, ip, packet, specifically, the, destination, ip, address, when, a, router, receives, a, packet, it, searches, its, routing, table, to, find, the, best, match, between, the, destination, ip, address, of, the, packet, and, one, of, the, addresses, in, the, routing, table, once, a, match, is, found, the, packet, is, encapsulated, in, the, layer, 2, data, link, frame, for, the, outgoing, interface, indicated, in, the, table, entry, a, router, typically, does, not, look, into, the, packet, payload, but, only, at, the, layer, 3, addresses, to, make, a, forwarding, decision, plus, optionally, other, information, in, the, header, for, hints, on, for, example, quality, of, service, qos, for, pure, ip, forwarding, a, router, is, designed, to, minimize, the, state, information, associated, with, individual, packets, once, a, packet, is, forwarded, the, router, does, not, retain, any, historical, information, about, the, packet, the, routing, table, itself, can, contain, information, derived, from, a, variety, of, sources, such, as, a, default, or, static, routes, that, are, configured, manually, or, dynamic, entries, from, routing, protocols, where, the, router, learns, routes, from, other, routers, a, default, route, is, one, that, is, used, to, route, all, traffic, whose, destination, does, not, otherwise, appear, in, the, routing, table, it, is, common, even, necessary, in, small, networks, such, as, a, home, or, small, business, where, the, default, route, simply, sends, all, non, local, traffic, to, the, internet, service, provider, the, default, route, can, be, manually, configured, as, a, static, route, learned, by, dynamic, routing, protocols, or, be, obtained, by, dhcp, a, router, can, run, more, than, one, routing, protocol, at, a, time, particularly, if, it, serves, as, an, autonomous, system, border, router, between, parts, of, a, network, that, run, different, routing, protocols, if, it, does, so, then, redistribution, may, be, used, usually, selectively, to, share, information, between, the, different, protocols, running, on, the, same, router, besides, deciding, to, which, interface, a, packet, is, forwarded, which, is, handled, primarily, via, the, routing, table, a, router, also, has, to, manage, congestion, when, packets, arrive, at, a, rate, higher, than, the, router, can, process, three, policies, commonly, used, are, tail, drop, random, early, detection, red, and, weighted, random, early, detection, wred, tail, drop, is, the, simplest, and, most, easily, implemented, the, router, simply, drops, new, incoming, packets, once, buffer, space, in, the, router, is, exhausted, red, probabilistically, drops, datagrams, early, when, the, queue, exceeds, a, pre, configured, portion, of, the, buffer, until, reaching, a, pre, determined, maximum, when, it, drops, all, incoming, packets, thus, reverting, to, tail, drop, wred, can, be, configured, to, drop, packets, more, readily, dependent, on, the, type, of, traffic, another, function, a, router, performs, is, traffic, classification, and, deciding, which, packet, should, be, processed, first, this, is, managed, through, qos, which, is, critical, when, voice, over, ip, is, deployed, so, as, not, to, introduce, excessive, latency, yet, another, function, a, router, performs, is, called, policy, based, routing, where, special, rules, are, constructed, to, override, the, rules, derived, from, the, routing, table, when, a, packet, forwarding, decision, is, made, some, of, the, functions, may, be, performed, through, an, application, specific, integrated, circuit, asic, to, avoid, the, overhead, of, scheduling, cpu, time, to, process, the, packets, others, may, have, to, be, performed, through, the, cpu, as, these, packets, need, special, attention, that, cannot, be, handled, by, an, asic
