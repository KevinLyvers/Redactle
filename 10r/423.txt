a, refrigerator, commonly, fridge, is, a, commercial, and, home, appliance, consisting, of, a, thermally, insulated, compartment, and, a, heat, pump, mechanical, electronic, or, chemical, that, transfers, heat, from, its, inside, to, its, external, environment, so, that, its, inside, is, cooled, to, a, temperature, below, the, room, temperature, refrigeration, is, an, essential, food, storage, technique, around, the, world, the, low, temperature, reduces, the, reproduction, rate, of, bacteria, so, the, refrigerator, lowers, the, rate, of, spoilage, a, refrigerator, maintains, a, temperature, a, few, degrees, above, the, freezing, point, of, water, the, optimal, temperature, range, for, perishable, food, storage, is, 3, to, 5, c, 37, to, 41, f, a, freezer, is, a, specialized, refrigerator, or, portion, of, a, refrigerator, that, maintains, its, contents, temperature, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, the, refrigerator, replaced, the, icebox, which, had, been, a, common, household, appliance, for, almost, a, century, and, a, half, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, recommends, that, the, refrigerator, be, kept, at, or, below, 4, c, 40, f, and, that, the, freezer, be, regulated, at, 18, c, 0, f, the, first, cooling, systems, for, food, involved, ice, artificial, refrigeration, began, in, the, mid, 1750s, and, developed, in, the, early, 1800s, in, 1834, the, first, working, vapor, compression, refrigeration, using, the, same, technology, seen, in, air, conditioners, system, was, built, the, first, commercial, ice, making, machine, was, invented, in, 1854, in, 1913, refrigerators, for, home, use, were, invented, in, 1923, frigidaire, introduced, the, first, self, contained, unit, the, introduction, of, freon, in, the, 1920s, expanded, the, refrigerator, market, during, the, 1930s, home, freezers, as, separate, compartments, larger, than, necessary, just, for, ice, cubes, were, introduced, in, 1940, frozen, foods, previously, a, luxury, item, became, commonplace, freezer, units, are, used, in, households, as, well, as, in, industry, and, commerce, commercial, refrigerator, and, freezer, units, were, in, use, for, almost, 40, years, prior, to, the, common, home, models, the, freezer, over, refrigerator, style, had, been, the, basic, style, since, the, 1940s, until, modern, side, by, side, refrigerators, broke, the, trend, a, vapor, compression, cycle, is, used, in, most, household, refrigerators, refrigerator, freezers, and, freezers, newer, refrigerators, may, include, automatic, defrosting, chilled, water, and, ice, from, a, dispenser, in, the, door, domestic, refrigerators, and, freezers, for, food, storage, are, made, in, a, range, of, sizes, among, the, smallest, are, peltier, type, refrigerators, designed, to, chill, beverages, a, large, domestic, refrigerator, stands, as, tall, as, a, person, and, may, be, about, one, metre, 3, ft, 3, in, wide, with, a, capacity, of, 0, 6, m, 3, 21, cu, ft, refrigerators, and, freezers, may, be, free, standing, or, built, into, a, kitchen, the, refrigerator, allows, the, modern, household, to, keep, food, fresh, for, longer, than, before, freezers, allow, people, to, buy, perishable, food, in, bulk, and, eat, it, at, leisure, and, make, bulk, purchases, ancient, origins, ancient, iranians, were, among, the, first, to, invent, a, form, of, cooler, utilizing, the, principles, of, evaporative, cooling, and, radiative, cooling, called, yakhch, ls, these, complexes, used, subterranean, storage, spaces, a, large, thickly, insulated, above, ground, domed, structure, and, outfitted, with, badgirs, wind, catchers, and, series, of, qanats, aqueducts, pre, electric, refrigeration, in, modern, times, before, the, invention, of, the, modern, electric, refrigerator, icehouses, and, iceboxes, were, used, to, provide, cool, storage, for, most, of, the, year, placed, near, freshwater, lakes, or, packed, with, snow, and, ice, during, the, winter, they, were, once, very, common, natural, means, are, still, used, to, cool, foods, today, on, mountainsides, runoff, from, melting, snow, is, a, convenient, way, to, cool, drinks, and, during, the, winter, one, can, keep, milk, fresh, much, longer, just, by, keeping, it, outdoors, the, word, refrigeratory, was, used, at, least, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, artificial, refrigeration, the, history, of, artificial, refrigeration, began, when, scottish, professor, william, cullen, designed, a, small, refrigerating, machine, in, 1755, cullen, used, a, pump, to, create, a, partial, vacuum, over, a, container, of, diethyl, ether, which, then, boiled, absorbing, heat, from, the, surrounding, air, the, experiment, even, created, a, small, amount, of, ice, but, had, no, practical, application, at, that, time, in, 1805, american, inventor, oliver, evans, described, a, closed, vapor, compression, refrigeration, cycle, for, the, production, of, ice, by, ether, under, vacuum, in, 1820, the, british, scientist, michael, faraday, liquefied, ammonia, and, other, gases, by, using, high, pressures, and, low, temperatures, and, in, 1834, an, american, expatriate, in, great, britain, jacob, perkins, built, the, first, working, vapor, compression, refrigeration, system, it, was, a, closed, cycle, device, that, could, operate, continuously, a, similar, attempt, was, made, in, 1842, by, american, physician, john, gorrie, who, built, a, working, prototype, but, it, was, a, commercial, failure, american, engineer, alexander, twining, took, out, a, british, patent, in, 1850, for, a, vapor, compression, system, that, used, ether, the, first, practical, vapor, compression, refrigeration, system, was, built, by, james, harrison, a, scottish, australian, his, 1856, patent, was, for, a, vapor, compression, system, using, ether, alcohol, or, ammonia, he, built, a, mechanical, ice, making, machine, in, 1851, on, the, banks, of, the, barwon, river, at, rocky, point, in, geelong, victoria, and, his, first, commercial, ice, making, machine, followed, in, 1854, harrison, also, introduced, commercial, vapor, compression, refrigeration, to, breweries, and, meat, packing, houses, and, by, 1861, a, dozen, of, his, systems, were, in, operation, the, first, gas, absorption, refrigeration, system, compressor, less, and, powered, by, a, heat, source, was, developed, by, edward, toussaint, of, france, in, 1859, and, patented, in, 1860, it, used, gaseous, ammonia, dissolved, in, water, aqua, ammonia, carl, von, linde, an, engineering, professor, at, the, technological, university, munich, in, germany, patented, an, improved, method, of, liquefying, gases, in, 1876, creating, the, first, reliable, and, efficient, compressed, ammonia, refrigerator, his, new, process, made, possible, the, use, of, gases, such, as, ammonia, nh, 3, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, and, methyl, chloride, ch, 3, cl, as, refrigerants, which, were, widely, used, for, that, purpose, until, the, late, 1920s, despite, safety, concerns, in, 1895, he, discovered, the, refrigeration, cycle, in, 1894, hungarian, inventor, and, industrialist, istv, n, r, ck, started, to, manufacture, a, large, industrial, ammonia, refrigerator, which, was, powered, by, electric, compressors, together, with, the, esslingen, machine, works, its, electric, compressors, were, manufactured, by, the, ganz, works, at, the, 1896, millennium, exhibition, r, ck, and, the, esslingen, machine, works, presented, a, 6, tonne, capacity, artificial, ice, producing, plant, in, 1906, the, first, large, hungarian, cold, store, with, a, capacity, of, 3, 000, tonnes, the, largest, in, europe, opened, in, t, th, k, lm, n, street, budapest, the, machine, was, manufactured, by, the, ganz, works, until, nationalisation, after, the, second, world, war, large, scale, industrial, refrigerator, production, in, hungary, was, in, the, hands, of, r, ck, and, ganz, works, commercial, refrigerator, and, freezer, units, which, go, by, many, other, names, were, in, use, for, almost, 40, years, prior, to, the, common, home, models, they, used, gas, systems, such, as, ammonia, r, 717, or, sulfur, dioxide, r, 764, which, occasionally, leaked, making, them, unsafe, for, home, use, practical, household, refrigerators, were, introduced, in, 1915, and, gained, wider, acceptance, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1930s, as, prices, fell, and, non, toxic, non, flammable, synthetic, refrigerants, such, as, freon, 12, r, 12, were, introduced, however, r, 12, proved, to, be, damaging, to, the, ozone, layer, causing, governments, to, issue, a, ban, on, its, use, in, new, refrigerators, and, air, conditioning, systems, in, 1994, the, less, harmful, replacement, for, r, 12, r, 134a, tetrafluoroethane, has, been, in, common, use, since, 1990, but, r, 12, is, still, found, in, many, old, systems, the, glass, fronted, beverage, cooler, is, mostly, used, as, a, commercial, refrigerator, these, types, of, appliances, are, usually, designed, for, specific, load, requirements, resulting, in, a, larger, cooling, mechanism, this, ensures, that, they, are, able, to, cope, with, a, large, throughput, of, drinks, and, frequent, door, opening, as, a, result, it, is, common, for, these, types, of, commercial, refrigerators, to, compose, up, to, 50, of, the, energy, usage, of, a, supermarket, in, 1913, the, first, electric, refrigerators, for, home, and, domestic, use, were, invented, and, produced, by, fred, w, wolf, of, fort, wayne, indiana, with, models, consisting, of, a, unit, that, was, mounted, on, top, of, an, ice, box, his, first, device, produced, over, the, next, few, years, in, several, hundred, units, was, called, domelre, in, 1914, engineer, nathaniel, b, wales, of, detroit, michigan, introduced, an, idea, for, a, practical, electric, refrigeration, unit, which, later, became, the, basis, for, the, kelvinator, a, self, contained, refrigerator, with, a, compressor, on, the, bottom, of, the, cabinet, was, invented, by, alfred, mellowes, in, 1916, mellowes, produced, this, refrigerator, commercially, but, was, bought, out, by, william, c, durant, in, 1918, who, started, the, frigidaire, company, to, mass, produce, refrigerators, in, 1918, kelvinator, company, introduced, the, first, refrigerator, with, any, type, of, automatic, control, the, absorption, refrigerator, was, invented, by, baltzar, von, platen, and, carl, munters, from, sweden, in, 1922, while, they, were, still, students, at, the, royal, institute, of, technology, in, stockholm, it, became, a, worldwide, success, and, was, commercialized, by, electrolux, other, pioneers, included, charles, tellier, david, boyle, and, raoul, pictet, carl, von, linde, was, the, first, to, patent, and, make, a, practical, and, compact, refrigerator, these, home, units, usually, required, the, installation, of, the, mechanical, parts, motor, and, compressor, in, the, basement, or, an, adjacent, room, while, the, cold, box, was, located, in, the, kitchen, there, was, a, 1922, model, that, consisted, of, a, wooden, cold, box, water, cooled, compressor, an, ice, cube, tray, and, a, 0, 25, cubic, metre, 9, cu, ft, compartment, and, cost, 714, a, 1922, model, t, ford, cost, about, 476, by, 1923, kelvinator, held, 80, percent, of, the, market, for, electric, refrigerators, also, in, 1923, frigidaire, introduced, the, first, self, contained, unit, about, this, same, time, porcelain, covered, metal, cabinets, began, to, appear, ice, cube, trays, were, introduced, more, and, more, during, the, 1920s, up, to, this, time, freezing, was, not, an, auxiliary, function, of, the, modern, refrigerator, the, first, refrigerator, to, see, widespread, use, was, the, general, electric, monitor, top, refrigerator, introduced, in, 1927, so, called, by, the, public, because, of, its, resemblance, to, the, gun, turret, on, the, ironclad, warship, uss, monitor, of, the, 1860s, the, compressor, assembly, which, emitted, a, great, deal, of, heat, was, placed, above, the, cabinet, and, enclosed, by, a, decorative, ring, over, a, million, units, were, produced, as, the, refrigerating, medium, these, refrigerators, used, either, sulfur, dioxide, which, is, corrosive, to, the, eyes, and, may, cause, loss, of, vision, painful, skin, burns, and, lesions, or, methyl, formate, which, is, highly, flammable, harmful, to, the, eyes, and, toxic, if, inhaled, or, ingested, the, introduction, of, freon, in, the, 1920s, expanded, the, refrigerator, market, during, the, 1930s, and, provided, a, safer, low, toxicity, alternative, to, previously, used, refrigerants, separate, freezers, became, common, during, the, 1940s, the, term, for, the, unit, popular, at, the, time, was, deep, freeze, these, devices, or, appliances, did, not, go, into, mass, production, for, use, in, the, home, until, after, world, war, ii, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, saw, technical, advances, like, automatic, defrosting, and, automatic, ice, making, more, efficient, refrigerators, were, developed, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, even, though, environmental, issues, led, to, the, banning, of, very, effective, freon, refrigerants, early, refrigerator, models, from, 1916, had, a, cold, compartment, for, ice, cube, trays, from, the, late, 1920s, fresh, vegetables, were, successfully, processed, through, freezing, by, the, postum, company, the, forerunner, of, general, foods, which, had, acquired, the, technology, when, it, bought, the, rights, to, clarence, birdseye, s, successful, fresh, freezing, methods, the, majority, of, refrigerators, were, white, in, the, early, 1950s, but, between, the, mid, 1950s, and, the, present, manufacturers, and, designers, have, added, color, pastel, colors, such, as, pink, and, turquoise, gained, popularity, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, certain, versions, also, had, brushed, chrome, plating, which, is, akin, to, a, stainless, steel, appearance, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 1960s, and, the, early, 1970s, earth, tone, colors, were, popular, including, harvest, gold, avocado, green, and, almond, in, the, 1980s, black, became, fashionable, in, the, late, 1990s, stainless, steel, came, into, vogue, since, 1961, the, color, marketing, group, has, attempted, to, coordinate, the, colors, of, appliances, and, other, consumer, goods, freezer, units, are, used, in, households, and, in, industry, and, commerce, food, stored, at, or, below, 18, c, 0, f, is, safe, indefinitely, most, household, freezers, maintain, temperatures, from, 23, to, 18, c, 9, to, 0, f, although, some, freezer, only, units, can, achieve, 34, c, 29, f, and, lower, refrigerator, freezers, generally, do, not, achieve, lower, than, 23, c, 9, f, since, the, same, coolant, loop, serves, both, compartments, lowering, the, freezer, compartment, temperature, excessively, causes, difficulties, in, maintaining, above, freezing, temperature, in, the, refrigerator, compartment, domestic, freezers, can, be, included, as, a, separate, compartment, in, a, refrigerator, or, can, be, a, separate, appliance, domestic, freezers, may, be, either, upright, resembling, a, refrigerator, or, chest, freezers, wider, than, tall, with, the, lid, or, door, on, top, sacrificing, convenience, for, efficiency, and, partial, immunity, to, power, outages, many, modern, upright, freezers, come, with, an, ice, dispenser, built, into, their, door, some, upscale, models, include, thermostat, displays, and, controls, home, freezers, as, separate, compartments, larger, than, necessary, just, for, ice, cubes, or, as, separate, units, were, introduced, in, the, united, states, in, 1940, frozen, foods, previously, a, luxury, item, became, commonplace, in, 1955, the, domestic, deep, freezer, which, was, cold, enough, to, allow, the, owners, to, freeze, fresh, food, themselves, rather, than, buying, food, already, frozen, with, clarence, birdseye, s, process, went, on, sale, there, are, walk, in, freezers, as, the, name, implies, they, allow, for, one, to, walk, into, the, freezer, safety, regulations, requires, an, emergency, releases, and, employers, should, check, to, ensure, no, one, will, trapped, inside, when, the, unit, gets, locked, as, hypothermia, is, possible, if, one, is, in, freezer, for, longer, periods, of, time, a, vapor, compression, cycle, is, used, in, most, household, refrigerators, refrigerator, freezers, and, freezers, in, this, cycle, a, circulating, refrigerant, such, as, r134a, enters, a, compressor, as, low, pressure, vapor, at, or, slightly, below, the, temperature, of, the, refrigerator, interior, the, vapor, is, compressed, and, exits, the, compressor, as, high, pressure, superheated, vapor, the, superheated, vapor, travels, under, pressure, through, coils, or, tubes, that, make, up, the, condenser, the, coils, or, tubes, are, passively, cooled, by, exposure, to, air, in, the, room, the, condenser, cools, the, vapor, which, liquefies, as, the, refrigerant, leaves, the, condenser, it, is, still, under, pressure, but, is, now, only, slightly, above, room, temperature, this, liquid, refrigerant, is, forced, through, a, metering, or, throttling, device, also, known, as, an, expansion, valve, essentially, a, pin, hole, sized, constriction, in, the, tubing, to, an, area, of, much, lower, pressure, the, sudden, decrease, in, pressure, results, in, explosive, like, flash, evaporation, of, a, portion, typically, about, half, of, the, liquid, the, latent, heat, absorbed, by, this, flash, evaporation, is, drawn, mostly, from, adjacent, still, liquid, refrigerant, a, phenomenon, known, as, auto, refrigeration, this, cold, and, partially, vaporized, refrigerant, continues, through, the, coils, or, tubes, of, the, evaporator, unit, a, fan, blows, air, from, the, compartment, box, air, across, these, coils, or, tubes, and, the, refrigerant, completely, vaporizes, drawing, further, latent, heat, from, the, box, air, this, cooled, air, is, returned, to, the, refrigerator, or, freezer, compartment, and, so, keeps, the, box, air, cold, note, that, the, cool, air, in, the, refrigerator, or, freezer, is, still, warmer, than, the, refrigerant, in, the, evaporator, refrigerant, leaves, the, evaporator, now, fully, vaporized, and, slightly, heated, and, returns, to, the, compressor, inlet, to, continue, the, cycle, modern, domestic, refrigerators, are, extremely, reliable, because, motor, and, compressor, are, integrated, within, a, welded, container, sealed, unit, with, greatly, reduced, likelihood, of, leakage, or, contamination, by, comparison, externally, coupled, refrigeration, compressors, such, as, those, in, automobile, air, conditioning, inevitably, leak, fluid, and, lubricant, past, the, shaft, seals, this, leads, to, a, requirement, for, periodic, recharging, and, if, ignored, possible, compressor, failure, refrigerators, with, two, compartments, need, special, design, to, control, the, cooling, of, refrigerator, or, freezer, compartments, typically, the, compressors, and, condenser, coils, are, mounted, at, the, top, of, the, cabinet, with, a, single, fan, to, cool, them, both, this, arrangement, has, a, few, downsides, each, compartment, cannot, be, controlled, independently, and, the, more, humid, refrigerator, air, is, mixed, with, the, dry, freezer, air, multiple, manufacturers, offer, dual, compressor, models, these, models, have, separate, freezer, and, refrigerator, compartments, that, operate, independently, of, each, other, sometimes, mounted, within, a, single, cabinet, each, has, its, own, separate, compressor, condenser, and, evaporator, coils, insulation, thermostat, and, door, a, hybrid, between, the, two, designs, is, using, a, separate, fan, for, each, compartment, the, dual, fan, approach, doing, so, allows, for, separate, control, and, airflow, on, a, single, compressor, system, an, absorption, refrigerator, works, differently, from, a, compressor, refrigerator, using, a, source, of, heat, such, as, combustion, of, liquefied, petroleum, gas, solar, thermal, energy, or, an, electric, heating, element, these, heat, sources, are, much, quieter, than, the, compressor, motor, in, a, typical, refrigerator, a, fan, or, pump, might, be, the, only, mechanical, moving, parts, reliance, on, convection, is, considered, impractical, other, uses, of, an, absorption, refrigerator, or, chiller, include, large, systems, used, in, office, buildings, or, complexes, such, as, hospitals, and, universities, these, large, systems, are, used, to, chill, a, brine, solution, that, is, circulated, through, the, building, the, peltier, effect, uses, electricity, to, pump, heat, directly, refrigerators, employing, this, system, are, sometimes, used, for, camping, or, in, situations, where, noise, is, not, acceptable, they, can, be, totally, silent, if, a, fan, for, air, circulation, is, not, fitted, but, are, less, energy, efficient, than, other, methods, ultra, cold, or, ultra, low, temperature, ult, typically, 80, or, 86, c, freezers, as, used, for, storing, biological, samples, also, generally, employ, two, stages, of, cooling, but, in, cascade, the, lower, temperature, stage, uses, methane, or, a, similar, gas, as, a, refrigerant, with, its, condenser, kept, at, around, 40, c, by, a, second, stage, which, uses, a, more, conventional, refrigerant, for, much, lower, temperatures, laboratories, usually, purchase, liquid, nitrogen, 196, c, kept, in, a, dewar, flask, into, which, the, samples, are, suspended, cryogenic, chest, freezers, can, achieve, temperatures, of, down, to, 150, c, 238, f, and, may, include, a, liquid, nitrogen, backup, alternatives, to, the, vapor, compression, cycle, not, in, current, mass, production, include, many, modern, refrigerator, freezers, have, the, freezer, on, top, and, the, refrigerator, on, the, bottom, most, refrigerator, freezers, except, for, manual, defrost, models, or, cheaper, units, use, what, appears, to, be, two, thermostats, only, the, refrigerator, compartment, is, properly, temperature, controlled, when, the, refrigerator, gets, too, warm, the, thermostat, starts, the, cooling, process, and, a, fan, circulates, the, air, around, the, freezer, during, this, time, the, refrigerator, also, gets, colder, the, freezer, control, knob, only, controls, the, amount, of, air, that, flows, into, the, refrigerator, via, a, damper, system, changing, the, refrigerator, temperature, will, inadvertently, change, the, freezer, temperature, in, the, opposite, direction, changing, the, freezer, temperature, will, have, no, effect, on, the, refrigerator, temperature, the, freezer, control, may, also, be, adjusted, to, compensate, for, any, refrigerator, adjustment, this, means, the, refrigerator, may, become, too, warm, however, because, only, enough, air, is, diverted, to, the, refrigerator, compartment, the, freezer, usually, re, acquires, the, set, temperature, quickly, unless, the, door, is, opened, when, a, door, is, opened, either, in, the, refrigerator, or, the, freezer, the, fan, in, some, units, stops, immediately, to, prevent, excessive, frost, build, up, on, the, freezer, s, evaporator, coil, because, this, coil, is, cooling, two, areas, when, the, freezer, reaches, temperature, the, unit, cycles, off, no, matter, what, the, refrigerator, temperature, is, modern, computerized, refrigerators, do, not, use, the, damper, system, the, computer, manages, fan, speed, for, both, compartments, although, air, is, still, blown, from, the, freezer, newer, refrigerators, may, include, these, older, freezer, compartments, were, the, main, cooling, body, of, the, refrigerator, and, only, maintained, a, temperature, of, around, 6, c, 21, f, which, is, suitable, for, keeping, food, for, a, week, later, advances, included, automatic, ice, units, and, self, compartmentalized, freezing, units, domestic, refrigerators, and, freezers, for, food, storage, are, made, in, a, range, of, sizes, among, the, smallest, is, a, 4, litre, 0, 14, cu, ft, peltier, refrigerator, advertised, as, being, able, to, hold, 6, cans, of, beer, a, large, domestic, refrigerator, stands, as, tall, as, a, person, and, may, be, about, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, wide, with, a, capacity, of, 600, litres, 21, cu, ft, some, models, for, small, households, fit, under, kitchen, work, surfaces, usually, about, 86, centimetres, 34, in, high, refrigerators, may, be, combined, with, freezers, either, stacked, with, refrigerator, or, freezer, above, below, or, side, by, side, a, refrigerator, without, a, frozen, food, storage, compartment, may, have, a, small, section, just, to, make, ice, cubes, freezers, may, have, drawers, to, store, food, in, or, they, may, have, no, divisions, chest, freezers, refrigerators, and, freezers, may, be, free, standing, or, built, into, a, kitchen, s, cabinet, three, distinct, classes, of, refrigerator, are, common, other, specialized, cooling, mechanisms, may, be, used, for, cooling, but, have, not, been, applied, to, domestic, or, commercial, refrigerators, in, a, house, without, air, conditioning, space, heating, and, or, cooling, refrigerators, consumed, more, energy, than, any, other, home, device, in, the, early, 1990s, a, competition, was, held, among, the, major, manufacturers, to, encourage, energy, efficiency, current, us, models, that, are, energy, star, qualified, use, 50, less, energy, than, the, average, models, made, in, 1974, the, most, energy, efficient, unit, made, in, the, us, consumes, about, half, a, kilowatt, hour, per, day, equivalent, to, 20, w, continuously, but, even, ordinary, units, are, quite, efficient, some, smaller, units, use, less, than, 0, 2, kwh, per, day, equivalent, to, 8, w, continuously, larger, units, especially, those, with, large, freezers, and, icemakers, may, use, as, much, as, 4, kw, h, per, day, equivalent, to, 170, w, continuously, the, european, union, uses, a, letter, based, mandatory, energy, efficiency, rating, label, instead, of, the, energy, star, thus, eu, refrigerators, at, the, point, of, sale, are, labelled, according, to, how, energy, efficient, they, are, for, us, refrigerators, the, consortium, on, energy, efficiency, cee, further, differentiates, between, energy, star, qualified, refrigerators, tier, 1, refrigerators, are, those, that, are, 20, to, 24, 9, more, efficient, than, the, federal, minimum, standards, set, by, the, national, appliance, energy, conservation, act, naeca, tier, 2, are, those, that, are, 25, to, 29, 9, more, efficient, tier, 3, is, the, highest, qualification, for, those, refrigerators, that, are, at, least, 30, more, efficient, than, federal, standards, about, 82, of, the, energy, star, qualified, refrigerators, are, tier, 1, with, 13, qualifying, as, tier, 2, and, just, 5, at, tier, 3, besides, the, standard, style, of, compressor, refrigeration, used, in, ordinary, household, refrigerators, and, freezers, there, are, technologies, such, as, absorption, refrigeration, and, magnetic, refrigeration, although, these, designs, generally, use, a, much, larger, amount, of, energy, compared, to, compressor, refrigeration, other, qualities, such, as, silent, operation, or, the, ability, to, use, gas, can, favor, these, refrigeration, units, in, small, enclosures, a, mobile, environment, or, in, environments, where, unit, failure, would, lead, to, devastating, consequences, many, refrigerators, made, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, were, far, more, efficient, than, most, that, were, made, later, this, is, partly, attributable, to, the, addition, of, new, features, such, as, auto, defrost, that, reduced, efficiency, additionally, after, world, war, 2, refrigerator, style, became, more, important, than, efficiency, this, was, especially, true, in, the, us, in, the, 1970s, when, side, by, side, models, known, as, american, fridgefreezers, outside, of, the, us, with, ice, dispensers, and, water, chillers, became, popular, however, the, reduction, in, efficiency, also, arose, partly, from, reduction, in, the, amount, of, insulation, to, cut, costs, because, of, the, introduction, of, new, energy, efficiency, standards, refrigerators, made, today, are, much, more, efficient, than, those, made, in, the, 1930s, they, consume, the, same, amount, of, energy, while, being, three, times, as, large, the, efficiency, of, older, refrigerators, can, be, improved, by, defrosting, if, the, unit, is, manual, defrost, and, cleaning, them, regularly, replacing, old, and, worn, door, seals, with, new, ones, adjusting, the, thermostat, to, accommodate, the, actual, contents, a, refrigerator, needn, t, be, colder, than, 4, c, 39, f, to, store, drinks, and, non, perishable, items, and, also, replacing, insulation, where, applicable, some, sites, recommend, cleaning, condenser, coils, every, month, or, so, on, units, with, coils, on, the, rear, to, add, life, to, the, coils, and, not, suffer, an, unnoticeable, deterioration, in, efficiency, over, an, extended, period, the, unit, should, be, able, to, ventilate, or, breathe, with, adequate, spaces, around, the, front, back, sides, and, above, the, unit, if, the, refrigerator, uses, a, fan, to, keep, the, condenser, cool, then, this, must, be, cleaned, or, serviced, at, per, individual, manufactures, recommendations, frost, free, refrigerators, or, freezers, use, electric, fans, to, cool, the, appropriate, compartment, this, could, be, called, a, fan, forced, refrigerator, whereas, manual, defrost, units, rely, on, colder, air, lying, at, the, bottom, versus, the, warm, air, at, the, top, to, achieve, adequate, cooling, the, air, is, drawn, in, through, an, inlet, duct, and, passed, through, the, evaporator, where, it, is, cooled, the, air, is, then, circulated, throughout, the, cabinet, via, a, series, of, ducts, and, vents, because, the, air, passing, the, evaporator, is, supposedly, warm, and, moist, frost, begins, to, form, on, the, evaporator, especially, on, a, freezer, s, evaporator, in, cheaper, and, or, older, models, a, defrost, cycle, is, controlled, via, a, mechanical, timer, this, timer, is, set, to, shut, off, the, compressor, and, fan, and, energize, a, heating, element, located, near, or, around, the, evaporator, for, about, 15, to, 30, minutes, at, every, 6, to, 12, hours, this, melts, any, frost, or, ice, build, up, and, allows, the, refrigerator, to, work, normally, once, more, it, is, believed, that, frost, free, units, have, a, lower, tolerance, for, frost, due, to, their, air, conditioner, like, evaporator, coils, therefore, if, a, door, is, left, open, accidentally, especially, the, freezer, the, defrost, system, may, not, remove, all, frost, in, this, case, the, freezer, or, refrigerator, must, be, defrosted, if, the, defrosting, system, melts, all, the, ice, before, the, timed, defrosting, period, ends, then, a, small, device, called, a, defrost, limiter, acts, like, a, thermostat, and, shuts, off, the, heating, element, to, prevent, too, large, a, temperature, fluctuation, it, also, prevents, hot, blasts, of, air, when, the, system, starts, again, should, it, finish, defrosting, early, on, some, early, frost, free, models, the, defrost, limiter, also, sends, a, signal, to, the, defrost, timer, to, start, the, compressor, and, fan, as, soon, as, it, shuts, off, the, heating, element, before, the, timed, defrost, cycle, ends, when, the, defrost, cycle, is, completed, the, compressor, and, fan, are, allowed, to, cycle, back, on, frost, free, refrigerators, including, some, early, frost, free, refrigerators, freezers, that, used, a, cold, plate, in, their, refrigerator, section, instead, of, airflow, from, the, freezer, section, generally, don, t, shut, off, their, refrigerator, fans, during, defrosting, this, allows, consumers, to, leave, food, in, the, main, refrigerator, compartment, uncovered, and, also, helps, keep, vegetables, moist, this, method, also, helps, reduce, energy, consumption, because, the, refrigerator, is, above, freeze, point, and, can, pass, the, warmer, than, freezing, air, through, the, evaporator, or, cold, plate, to, aid, the, defrosting, cycle, with, the, advent, of, digital, inverter, compressors, the, energy, consumption, is, even, further, reduced, than, a, single, speed, induction, motor, compressor, and, thus, contributes, far, less, in, the, way, of, greenhouse, gases, the, energy, consumption, of, a, refrigerator, is, also, dependent, on, the, type, of, refrigeration, being, done, for, instance, inverter, refrigerators, consume, comparatively, less, energy, than, a, typical, non, inverter, refrigerator, in, an, inverter, refrigerator, the, compressor, is, used, conditionally, on, requirement, basis, for, instance, an, inverter, refrigerator, might, use, less, energy, during, the, winters, than, it, does, during, the, summers, this, is, because, the, compressor, works, for, a, shorter, time, than, it, does, during, the, summers, further, newer, models, of, inverter, compressor, refrigerators, take, into, account, various, external, and, internal, conditions, to, adjust, the, compressor, speed, and, thus, optimize, cooling, and, energy, consumption, most, of, them, use, at, least, 4, sensors, which, help, detect, variance, in, external, temperature, internal, temperature, owing, to, opening, of, the, refrigerator, door, or, keeping, new, food, inside, humidity, and, usage, patterns, depending, on, the, sensor, inputs, the, compressor, adjusts, its, speed, for, example, if, door, is, opened, or, new, food, is, kept, the, sensor, detects, an, increase, in, temperature, inside, the, cabin, and, signals, the, compressor, to, increase, its, speed, till, a, pre, determined, temperature, is, attained, after, which, the, compressor, runs, at, a, minimum, speed, to, just, maintain, the, internal, temperature, the, compressor, typically, runs, between, 1200, and, 4500, rpm, inverter, compressors, not, only, optimizes, cooling, but, is, also, superior, in, terms, of, durability, and, energy, efficiency, a, device, consumes, maximum, energy, and, undergoes, maximum, wear, and, tear, when, it, switches, itself, on, as, an, inverter, compressor, never, switches, itself, off, and, instead, runs, on, varying, speed, it, minimizes, wear, and, tear, and, energy, usage, lg, played, a, significant, role, in, improving, inverter, compressors, as, we, know, it, by, reducing, the, friction, points, in, the, compressor, and, thus, introducing, linear, inverter, compressors, conventionally, all, domestic, refrigerators, use, a, reciprocating, drive, which, is, connected, to, the, piston, but, in, a, linear, inverter, compressor, the, piston, which, is, a, permanent, magnet, is, suspended, between, two, electromagnets, the, ac, changes, the, magnetic, poles, of, the, electromagnet, which, results, in, the, push, and, pull, that, compresses, the, refrigerant, lg, claims, that, this, helps, reduce, energy, consumption, by, 32, and, noise, by, 25, compared, to, their, conventional, compressors, the, physical, design, of, refrigerators, also, plays, a, large, part, in, its, energy, efficiency, the, most, efficient, is, the, chest, style, freezer, as, its, top, opening, design, minimizes, convection, when, opening, the, doors, reducing, the, amount, of, warm, moist, air, entering, the, freezer, on, the, other, hand, in, door, ice, dispensers, cause, more, heat, leakage, contributing, to, an, increase, in, energy, consumption, the, gradual, global, adoption, of, refrigerators, marks, a, transformative, era, in, food, preservation, and, domestic, convenience, since, the, refrigerators, introduction, in, the, 20th, century, refrigerators, have, transitioned, from, being, luxurious, items, to, everyday, commodities, which, have, altered, the, understandings, of, food, storage, practices, refrigerators, have, significantly, impacted, various, aspects, of, many, individual, s, daily, lives, by, providing, food, safety, to, people, around, the, world, spanning, across, a, wide, variety, of, cultural, and, socioeconomic, backgrounds, the, global, adoption, of, refrigerators, has, also, changed, how, societies, handle, their, food, supply, the, introduction, of, the, refrigerator, in, different, societies, has, resulted, in, the, monetization, and, industrialized, mass, food, production, systems, which, are, commonly, linked, to, increased, food, waste, animal, wastes, and, dangerous, chemical, wastes, being, traced, back, into, different, ecosystems, in, addition, refrigerators, have, also, provided, an, easier, way, to, access, food, for, many, individuals, around, the, world, with, many, options, that, commercialization, has, promoted, leaning, towards, low, nutrient, dense, foods, after, consumer, refrigerators, became, financially, viable, for, production, and, sale, on, a, large, scale, their, prevalence, around, the, globe, expanded, greatly, in, the, united, states, an, estimated, 99, 5, of, households, have, a, refrigerator, refrigerator, ownership, are, more, common, in, developed, western, countries, but, has, stayed, relatively, low, in, eastern, and, developing, countries, despite, its, growing, popularity, throughout, eastern, europe, and, the, middle, east, only, 80, of, its, population, own, refrigerators, in, addition, to, this, 65, of, the, population, in, china, are, stated, to, have, refrigerators, the, distribution, of, consumer, refrigerators, are, also, skewed, as, urban, areas, exhibit, larger, refrigeration, ownership, percentages, compared, to, rural, areas, the, ice, trade, was, a, industry, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, of, the, harvesting, transportation, and, sale, of, natural, and, artificial, ice, for, the, purposes, of, refrigeration, and, consumption, the, majority, of, the, ice, used, for, trade, was, harvested, from, north, america, and, transported, globally, with, some, smaller, operations, working, out, of, norway, with, the, introduction, of, more, affordable, large, and, home, scale, refrigeration, around, the, 1920, s, the, need, for, large, scale, ice, harvest, and, transportation, was, no, longer, needed, and, the, ice, trade, subsequently, slowed, and, shrank, to, smaller, scale, local, services, or, disappeared, altogether, the, refrigerator, allows, households, to, keep, food, fresh, for, longer, than, before, the, most, notable, improvement, is, for, meat, and, other, highly, perishable, wares, which, previously, needed, to, be, preserved, or, otherwise, processed, for, long, term, storage, and, transport, this, change, in, the, supply, chains, of, food, products, led, to, a, marked, increase, in, the, quality, of, food, in, areas, where, refrigeration, was, being, used, additionally, the, increased, freshness, and, shelf, life, of, food, caused, by, the, advent, of, refrigeration, in, addition, to, growing, global, communication, methods, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, cultural, exchange, through, food, products, from, different, regions, of, the, world, there, have, also, been, claims, that, this, increase, in, the, quality, of, food, is, responsible, for, an, increased, in, the, height, of, united, states, citizens, around, the, early, 1900, s, refrigeration, has, also, contributed, to, a, decrease, in, the, quality, of, food, in, some, regions, by, allowing, in, part, for, the, phenomena, of, globalization, in, the, food, sector, refrigeration, has, made, the, creation, and, transportation, of, ultra, processed, foods, and, convenience, foods, inexpensive, leading, to, their, prevalence, especially, in, lower, income, regions, these, regions, of, lessened, access, to, higher, quality, foods, are, referred, to, as, food, deserts, freezers, allow, people, to, buy, food, in, bulk, and, eat, it, at, leisure, and, bulk, purchases, may, save, money, ice, cream, a, popular, commodity, of, the, 20th, century, could, previously, only, be, obtained, by, traveling, to, where, the, product, was, made, and, eating, it, on, the, spot, now, it, is, a, common, food, item, ice, on, demand, not, only, adds, to, the, enjoyment, of, cold, drinks, but, is, useful, for, first, aid, and, for, cold, packs, that, can, be, kept, frozen, for, picnics, or, in, case, of, emergency, the, capacity, of, a, refrigerator, is, measured, in, either, liters, or, cubic, feet, typically, the, volume, of, a, combined, refrigerator, freezer, is, split, with, 1, 3rds, to, 1, 4th, of, the, volume, allocated, to, the, freezer, although, these, values, are, highly, variable, temperature, settings, for, refrigerator, and, freezer, compartments, are, often, given, arbitrary, numbers, by, manufacturers, for, example, 1, through, 9, warmest, to, coldest, but, generally, 3, to, 5, c, 37, to, 41, f, is, ideal, for, the, refrigerator, compartment, and, 18, c, 0, f, for, the, freezer, some, refrigerators, must, be, within, certain, external, temperature, parameters, to, run, properly, this, can, be, an, issue, when, placing, units, in, an, unfinished, area, such, as, a, garage, some, refrigerators, are, now, divided, into, four, zones, to, store, different, types, of, food, european, freezers, and, refrigerators, with, a, freezer, compartment, have, a, four, star, rating, system, to, grade, freezers, although, both, the, three, and, four, star, ratings, specify, the, same, storage, times, and, same, minimum, temperature, of, 18, c, 0, f, only, a, four, star, freezer, is, intended, for, freezing, fresh, food, and, may, include, a, fast, freeze, function, runs, the, compressor, continually, down, to, as, low, as, 26, c, 15, f, to, facilitate, this, three, or, fewer, stars, are, used, for, frozen, food, compartments, that, are, only, suitable, for, storing, frozen, food, introducing, fresh, food, into, such, a, compartment, is, likely, to, result, in, unacceptable, temperature, rises, this, difference, in, categorization, is, shown, in, the, design, of, the, 4, star, logo, where, the, standard, three, stars, are, displayed, in, a, box, using, positive, colours, denoting, the, same, normal, operation, as, a, 3, star, freezer, and, the, fourth, star, showing, the, additional, fresh, food, fast, freeze, function, is, prefixed, to, the, box, in, negative, colours, or, with, other, distinct, formatting, most, european, refrigerators, include, a, moist, cold, refrigerator, section, which, does, require, automatic, defrosting, at, irregular, intervals, and, a, rarely, frost, free, freezer, section, from, warmest, to, coolest, an, increasingly, important, environmental, concern, is, the, disposal, of, old, refrigerators, initially, because, freon, coolant, damages, the, ozone, layer, but, as, older, generation, refrigerators, wear, out, the, destruction, of, cfc, bearing, insulation, also, causes, concern, modern, refrigerators, usually, use, a, refrigerant, called, hfc, 134a, 1, 1, 1, 2, tetrafluoroethane, which, does, not, deplete, the, ozone, layer, unlike, freon, r, 134a, is, becoming, much, rarer, in, europe, where, newer, refrigerants, are, being, used, instead, the, main, refrigerant, now, used, is, r, 600a, also, known, as, isobutane, which, has, a, smaller, effect, on, the, atmosphere, if, released, there, have, been, reports, of, refrigerators, exploding, if, the, refrigerant, leaks, isobutane, in, the, presence, of, a, spark, if, the, coolant, leaks, into, the, refrigerator, at, times, when, the, door, is, not, being, opened, such, as, overnight, the, concentration, of, coolant, in, the, air, within, the, refrigerator, can, build, up, to, form, an, explosive, mixture, that, can, be, ignited, either, by, a, spark, from, the, thermostat, or, when, the, light, comes, on, as, the, door, is, opened, resulting, in, documented, cases, of, serious, property, damage, and, injury, or, even, death, from, the, resulting, explosion, disposal, of, discarded, refrigerators, is, regulated, often, mandating, the, removal, of, doors, for, safety, reasons, children, playing, hide, and, seek, have, been, asphyxiated, while, hiding, inside, discarded, refrigerators, particularly, older, models, with, latching, doors, in, a, phenomenon, called, refrigerator, death, since, 2, august, 1956, under, u, s, federal, law, refrigerator, doors, are, no, longer, permitted, to, latch, and, they, can, be, opened, from, the, inside, modern, units, use, a, magnetic, door, gasket, that, holds, the, door, sealed, but, allows, it, to, be, pushed, open, from, the, inside, this, gasket, was, invented, developed, and, manufactured, by, max, baermann, 1903, 1984, of, bergisch, gladbach, germany, regarding, total, life, cycle, costs, many, governments, offer, incentives, to, encourage, recycling, of, old, refrigerators, one, example, is, the, phoenix, refrigerator, program, launched, in, australia, this, government, incentive, picked, up, old, refrigerators, paying, their, owners, for, donating, the, refrigerator, the, refrigerator, was, then, refurbished, with, new, door, seals, a, thorough, cleaning, and, the, removal, of, items, such, as, the, cover, that, is, strapped, to, the, back, of, many, older, units, the, resulting, refrigerators, now, over, 10, more, efficient, were, then, distributed, to, low, income, families, similar, to, the, australian, program, the, united, states, also, has, a, program, for, collecting, and, replacing, older, less, efficient, refrigerators, and, other, white, goods, these, programs, seek, to, collect, large, appliances, that, may, be, old, and, inefficient, or, breaking, and, replace, them, with, newer, and, more, efficient, appliances, this, is, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, cost, of, the, additional, cost, these, appliances, impose, on, lower, income, families, through, their, inefficient, energy, and, gas, usage, as, well, as, reduce, pollution, caused, by, the, continued, use, of, these, appliances
