electric, power, transmission, is, the, bulk, movement, of, electrical, energy, from, a, generating, site, such, as, a, power, plant, to, an, electrical, substation, the, interconnected, lines, that, facilitate, this, movement, form, a, transmission, network, this, is, distinct, from, the, local, wiring, between, high, voltage, substations, and, customers, which, is, typically, referred, to, as, electric, power, distribution, the, combined, transmission, and, distribution, network, is, part, of, electricity, delivery, known, as, the, electrical, grid, efficient, long, distance, transmission, of, electric, power, requires, high, voltages, this, reduces, the, losses, produced, by, strong, currents, transmission, lines, use, either, alternating, current, ac, or, direct, current, dc, the, voltage, level, is, changed, with, transformers, the, voltage, is, stepped, up, for, transmission, then, reduced, for, local, distribution, a, wide, area, synchronous, grid, known, as, an, interconnection, in, north, america, directly, connects, generators, delivering, ac, power, with, the, same, relative, frequency, to, many, consumers, north, america, has, four, major, interconnections, western, eastern, quebec, and, texas, one, grid, connects, most, of, continental, europe, historically, transmission, and, distribution, lines, were, often, owned, by, the, same, company, but, starting, in, the, 1990s, many, countries, liberalized, the, regulation, of, the, electricity, market, in, ways, that, led, to, separate, companies, handling, transmission, and, distribution, most, north, american, transmission, lines, are, high, voltage, three, phase, ac, although, single, phase, ac, is, sometimes, used, in, railway, electrification, systems, dc, technology, is, used, for, greater, efficiency, over, longer, distances, typically, hundreds, of, miles, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, technology, is, also, used, in, submarine, power, cables, typically, longer, than, 30, miles, 50, km, and, in, the, interchange, of, power, between, grids, that, are, not, mutually, synchronized, hvdc, links, stabilize, power, distribution, networks, where, sudden, new, loads, or, blackouts, in, one, part, of, a, network, might, otherwise, result, in, synchronization, problems, and, cascading, failures, electricity, is, transmitted, at, high, voltages, to, reduce, the, energy, loss, due, to, resistance, that, occurs, over, long, distances, power, is, usually, transmitted, through, overhead, power, lines, underground, power, transmission, has, a, significantly, higher, installation, cost, and, greater, operational, limitations, but, lowers, maintenance, costs, underground, transmission, is, more, common, in, urban, areas, or, environmentally, sensitive, locations, electrical, energy, must, typically, be, generated, at, the, same, rate, at, which, it, is, consumed, a, sophisticated, control, system, is, required, to, ensure, that, power, generation, closely, matches, demand, if, demand, exceeds, supply, the, imbalance, can, cause, generation, plant, s, and, transmission, equipment, to, automatically, disconnect, or, shut, down, to, prevent, damage, in, the, worst, case, this, may, lead, to, a, cascading, series, of, shutdowns, and, a, major, regional, blackout, the, us, northeast, faced, blackouts, in, 1965, 1977, 2003, and, major, blackouts, in, other, us, regions, in, 1996, and, 2011, electric, transmission, networks, are, interconnected, into, regional, national, and, even, continent, wide, networks, to, reduce, the, risk, of, such, a, failure, by, providing, multiple, redundant, alternative, routes, for, power, to, flow, should, such, shutdowns, occur, transmission, companies, determine, the, maximum, reliable, capacity, of, each, line, ordinarily, less, than, its, physical, or, thermal, limit, to, ensure, that, spare, capacity, is, available, in, the, event, of, a, failure, in, another, part, of, the, network, high, voltage, overhead, conductors, are, not, covered, by, insulation, the, conductor, material, is, nearly, always, an, aluminum, alloy, formed, of, several, strands, and, possibly, reinforced, with, steel, strands, copper, was, sometimes, used, for, overhead, transmission, but, aluminum, is, lighter, reduces, yields, only, marginally, and, costs, much, less, overhead, conductors, are, supplied, by, several, companies, conductor, material, and, shapes, are, regularly, improved, to, increase, capacity, conductor, sizes, range, from, 12, mm, 2, 6, american, wire, gauge, to, 750, mm, 2, 1, 590, 000, circular, mils, area, with, varying, resistance, and, current, carrying, capacity, for, large, conductors, more, than, a, few, centimetres, in, diameter, much, of, the, current, flow, is, concentrated, near, the, surface, due, to, the, skin, effect, the, center, of, the, conductor, carries, little, current, but, contributes, weight, and, cost, thus, multiple, parallel, cables, called, bundle, conductors, are, used, for, higher, capacity, bundle, conductors, are, used, at, high, voltages, to, reduce, energy, loss, caused, by, corona, discharge, today, transmission, level, voltages, are, usually, 110, kv, and, above, lower, voltages, such, as, 66, kv, and, 33, kv, are, usually, considered, subtransmission, voltages, but, are, occasionally, used, on, long, lines, with, light, loads, voltages, less, than, 33, kv, are, usually, used, for, distribution, voltages, above, 765, kv, are, considered, extra, high, voltage, and, require, different, designs, overhead, transmission, wires, depend, on, air, for, insulation, requiring, that, lines, maintain, minimum, clearances, adverse, weather, conditions, such, as, high, winds, and, low, temperatures, interrupt, transmission, wind, speeds, as, low, as, 23, knots, 43, km, h, can, permit, conductors, to, encroach, operating, clearances, resulting, in, a, flashover, and, loss, of, supply, oscillatory, motion, of, the, physical, line, is, termed, conductor, gallop, or, flutter, depending, on, the, frequency, and, amplitude, of, oscillation, electric, power, can, be, transmitted, by, underground, power, cables, underground, cables, take, up, no, right, of, way, have, lower, visibility, and, are, less, affected, by, weather, however, cables, must, be, insulated, cable, and, excavation, costs, are, much, higher, than, overhead, construction, faults, in, buried, transmission, lines, take, longer, to, locate, and, repair, in, some, metropolitan, areas, cables, are, enclosed, by, metal, pipe, and, insulated, with, dielectric, fluid, usually, an, oil, that, is, either, static, or, circulated, via, pumps, if, an, electric, fault, damages, the, pipe, and, leaks, dielectric, liquid, nitrogen, is, used, to, freeze, portions, of, the, pipe, to, enable, draining, and, repair, this, extends, the, repair, period, and, increases, costs, the, temperature, of, the, pipe, and, surroundings, are, monitored, throughout, the, repair, period, underground, lines, are, limited, by, their, thermal, capacity, which, permits, less, overload, or, re, rating, lines, long, underground, ac, cables, have, significant, capacitance, which, reduces, their, ability, to, provide, useful, power, beyond, 50, miles, 80, kilometres, dc, cables, are, not, limited, in, length, by, their, capacitance, commercial, electric, power, was, initially, transmitted, at, the, same, voltage, used, by, lighting, and, mechanical, loads, this, restricted, the, distance, between, generating, plant, and, loads, in, 1882, dc, voltage, could, not, easily, be, increased, for, long, distance, transmission, different, classes, of, loads, for, example, lighting, fixed, motors, and, traction, railway, systems, required, different, voltages, and, so, used, different, generators, and, circuits, thus, generators, were, sited, near, their, loads, a, practice, that, later, became, known, as, distributed, generation, using, large, numbers, of, small, generators, transmission, of, alternating, current, ac, became, possible, after, lucien, gaulard, and, john, dixon, gibbs, built, what, they, called, the, secondary, generator, an, early, transformer, provided, with, 1, 1, turn, ratio, and, open, magnetic, circuit, in, 1881, the, first, long, distance, ac, line, was, 34, kilometres, 21, miles, long, built, for, the, 1884, international, exhibition, of, electricity, in, turin, italy, it, was, powered, by, a, 2, kv, 130, hz, siemens, halske, alternator, and, featured, several, gaulard, transformers, with, primary, windings, connected, in, series, which, fed, incandescent, lamps, the, system, proved, the, feasibility, of, ac, electric, power, transmission, over, long, distances, the, first, commercial, ac, distribution, system, entered, service, in, 1885, in, via, dei, cerchi, rome, italy, for, public, lighting, it, was, powered, by, two, siemens, halske, alternators, rated, 30, hp, 22, kw, 2, kv, at, 120, hz, and, used, 19, km, of, cables, and, 200, parallel, connected, 2, kv, to, 20, v, step, down, transformers, provided, with, a, closed, magnetic, circuit, one, for, each, lamp, a, few, months, later, it, was, followed, by, the, first, british, ac, system, serving, grosvenor, gallery, it, also, featured, siemens, alternators, and, 2, 4, kv, to, 100, v, step, down, transformers, one, per, user, with, shunt, connected, primaries, working, to, improve, what, he, considered, an, impractical, gaulard, gibbs, design, electrical, engineer, william, stanley, jr, developed, the, first, practical, series, ac, transformer, in, 1885, working, with, the, support, of, george, westinghouse, in, 1886, he, demonstrated, a, transformer, based, ac, lighting, system, in, great, barrington, massachusetts, it, was, powered, by, a, steam, engine, driven, 500, v, siemens, generator, voltage, was, stepped, down, to, 100, volts, using, the, stanley, transformer, to, power, incandescent, lamps, at, 23, businesses, over, 4, 000, feet, 1, 200, m, this, practical, demonstration, of, a, transformer, and, alternating, current, lighting, system, led, westinghouse, to, begin, installing, ac, systems, later, that, year, in, 1888, the, first, designs, for, an, ac, motor, appeared, these, were, induction, motors, running, on, polyphase, current, independently, invented, by, galileo, ferraris, and, nikola, tesla, westinghouse, licensed, tesla, s, design, practical, three, phase, motors, were, designed, by, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, and, charles, eugene, lancelot, brown, widespread, use, of, such, motors, were, delayed, many, years, by, development, problems, and, the, scarcity, of, polyphase, power, systems, needed, to, power, them, in, the, late, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, smaller, electric, companies, merged, into, larger, corporations, such, as, ganz, and, aeg, in, europe, and, general, electric, and, westinghouse, electric, in, the, us, these, companies, developed, ac, systems, but, the, technical, difference, between, direct, and, alternating, current, systems, required, a, much, longer, technical, merger, alternating, current, s, economies, of, scale, with, large, generating, plants, and, long, distance, transmission, slowly, added, the, ability, to, link, all, the, loads, these, included, single, phase, ac, systems, poly, phase, ac, systems, low, voltage, incandescent, lighting, high, voltage, arc, lighting, and, existing, dc, motors, in, factories, and, street, cars, in, what, became, a, universal, system, these, technological, differences, were, temporarily, bridged, via, the, rotary, converters, and, motor, generators, that, allowed, the, legacy, systems, to, connect, to, the, ac, grid, these, stopgaps, were, slowly, replaced, as, older, systems, were, retired, or, upgraded, the, first, transmission, of, single, phase, alternating, current, using, high, voltage, came, in, oregon, in, 1890, when, power, was, delivered, from, a, hydroelectric, plant, at, willamette, falls, to, the, city, of, portland, 14, miles, 23, km, down, river, the, first, three, phase, alternating, current, using, high, voltage, took, place, in, 1891, during, the, international, electricity, exhibition, in, frankfurt, a, 15, kv, transmission, line, approximately, 175, km, long, connected, lauffen, on, the, neckar, and, frankfurt, transmission, voltages, increased, throughout, the, 20th, century, by, 1914, fifty, five, transmission, systems, operating, at, more, than, 70, kv, were, in, service, the, highest, voltage, then, used, was, 150, kv, interconnecting, multiple, generating, plants, over, a, wide, area, reduced, costs, the, most, efficient, plants, could, be, used, to, supply, varying, loads, during, the, day, reliability, was, improved, and, capital, costs, were, reduced, because, stand, by, generating, capacity, could, be, shared, over, many, more, customers, and, a, wider, area, remote, and, low, cost, sources, of, energy, such, as, hydroelectric, power, or, mine, mouth, coal, could, be, exploited, to, further, lower, costs, the, 20th, century, s, rapid, industrialization, made, electrical, transmission, lines, and, grids, critical, infrastructure, interconnection, of, local, generation, plants, and, small, distribution, networks, was, spurred, by, world, war, i, when, large, electrical, generating, plants, were, built, by, governments, to, power, munitions, factories, these, networks, use, components, such, as, power, lines, cables, circuit, breakers, switches, and, transformers, the, transmission, network, is, usually, administered, on, a, regional, basis, by, an, entity, such, as, a, regional, transmission, organization, or, transmission, system, operator, transmission, efficiency, is, improved, at, higher, voltage, and, lower, current, the, reduced, current, reduces, heating, losses, joule, s, first, law, states, that, energy, losses, are, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, current, thus, reducing, the, current, by, a, factor, of, two, lowers, the, energy, lost, to, conductor, resistance, by, a, factor, of, four, for, any, given, size, of, conductor, the, optimum, size, of, a, conductor, for, a, given, voltage, and, current, can, be, estimated, by, kelvin, s, law, for, conductor, size, which, states, that, size, is, optimal, when, the, annual, cost, of, energy, wasted, in, resistance, is, equal, to, the, annual, capital, charges, of, providing, the, conductor, at, times, of, lower, interest, rates, and, low, commodity, costs, kelvin, s, law, indicates, that, thicker, wires, are, optimal, otherwise, thinner, conductors, are, indicated, since, power, lines, are, designed, for, long, term, use, kelvin, s, law, is, used, in, conjunction, with, long, term, estimates, of, the, price, of, copper, and, aluminum, as, well, as, interest, rates, higher, voltage, is, achieved, in, ac, circuits, by, using, a, step, up, transformer, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, systems, require, relatively, costly, conversion, equipment, that, may, be, economically, justified, for, particular, projects, such, as, submarine, cables, and, longer, distance, high, capacity, point, to, point, transmission, hvdc, is, necessary, for, sending, energy, between, unsynchronized, grids, a, transmission, grid, is, a, network, of, power, stations, transmission, lines, and, substations, energy, is, usually, transmitted, within, a, grid, with, three, phase, ac, single, phase, ac, is, used, only, for, distribution, to, end, users, since, it, is, not, usable, for, large, polyphase, induction, motors, in, the, 19th, century, two, phase, transmission, was, used, but, required, either, four, wires, or, three, wires, with, unequal, currents, higher, order, phase, systems, require, more, than, three, wires, but, deliver, little, or, no, benefit, while, the, price, of, generating, capacity, is, high, energy, demand, is, variable, making, it, often, cheaper, to, import, needed, power, than, to, generate, it, locally, because, loads, often, rise, and, fall, together, across, large, areas, power, often, comes, from, distant, sources, because, of, the, economic, benefits, of, load, sharing, wide, area, transmission, grids, may, span, countries, and, even, continents, interconnections, between, producers, and, consumers, enables, power, to, flow, even, if, some, links, are, inoperative, the, slowly, varying, portion, of, demand, is, known, as, the, base, load, and, is, generally, served, by, large, facilities, with, constant, operating, costs, termed, firm, power, such, facilities, are, nuclear, coal, or, hydroelectric, while, other, energy, sources, such, as, concentrated, solar, thermal, and, geothermal, power, have, the, potential, to, provide, firm, power, renewable, energy, sources, such, as, solar, photovoltaics, wind, wave, and, tidal, are, due, to, their, intermittency, not, considered, to, be, firm, the, remaining, or, peak, power, demand, is, supplied, by, peaking, power, plants, which, are, typically, smaller, faster, responding, and, higher, cost, sources, such, as, combined, cycle, or, combustion, turbine, plants, typically, fueled, by, natural, gas, long, distance, transmission, hundreds, of, kilometers, is, cheap, and, efficient, with, costs, of, us, 0, 005, 0, 02, per, kwh, compared, to, annual, averaged, large, producer, costs, of, us, 0, 01, 0, 025, per, kwh, retail, rates, upwards, of, us, 0, 10, per, kwh, and, multiples, of, retail, for, instantaneous, suppliers, at, unpredicted, high, demand, moments, new, york, often, buys, over, 1000, mw, of, low, cost, hydropower, from, canada, local, sources, even, if, more, expensive, and, infrequently, used, can, protect, the, power, supply, from, weather, and, other, disasters, that, can, disconnect, distant, suppliers, hydro, and, wind, sources, cannot, be, moved, closer, to, big, cities, and, solar, costs, are, lowest, in, remote, areas, where, local, power, needs, are, nominal, connection, costs, can, determine, whether, any, particular, renewable, alternative, is, economically, realistic, costs, can, be, prohibitive, for, transmission, lines, but, high, capacity, long, distance, super, grid, transmission, network, costs, could, be, recovered, with, modest, usage, fees, at, power, stations, power, is, produced, at, a, relatively, low, voltage, between, about, 2, 3, kv, and, 30, kv, depending, on, the, size, of, the, unit, the, voltage, is, then, stepped, up, by, the, power, station, transformer, to, a, higher, voltage, 115, kv, to, 765, kv, ac, for, transmission, in, the, united, states, power, transmission, is, variously, 230, kv, to, 500, kv, with, less, than, 230, kv, or, more, than, 500, kv, as, exceptions, the, western, interconnection, has, two, primary, interchange, voltages, 500, kv, ac, at, 60, hz, and, 500, kv, 1, 000, kv, net, dc, from, north, to, south, columbia, river, to, southern, california, and, northeast, to, southwest, utah, to, southern, california, the, 287, 5, kv, hoover, dam, to, los, angeles, line, via, victorville, and, 345, kv, arizona, public, service, aps, line, are, local, standards, both, of, which, were, implemented, before, 500, kv, became, practical, transmitting, electricity, at, high, voltage, reduces, the, fraction, of, energy, lost, to, joule, heating, which, varies, by, conductor, type, the, current, and, the, transmission, distance, for, example, a, 100, mi, 160, km, span, at, 765, kv, carrying, 1000, mw, of, power, can, have, losses, of, 0, 5, to, 1, 1, a, 345, kv, line, carrying, the, same, load, across, the, same, distance, has, losses, of, 4, 2, for, a, given, amount, of, power, a, higher, voltage, reduces, the, current, and, thus, the, resistive, losses, for, example, raising, the, voltage, by, a, factor, of, 10, reduces, the, current, by, a, corresponding, factor, of, 10, and, therefore, the, i, 2, r, displaystyle, i, 2, r, losses, by, a, factor, of, 100, provided, the, same, sized, conductors, are, used, in, both, cases, even, if, the, conductor, size, cross, sectional, area, is, decreased, ten, fold, to, match, the, lower, current, the, i, 2, r, displaystyle, i, 2, r, losses, are, still, reduced, ten, fold, using, the, higher, voltage, while, power, loss, can, also, be, reduced, by, increasing, the, wire, s, conductance, by, increasing, its, cross, sectional, area, larger, conductors, are, heavier, and, more, expensive, and, since, conductance, is, proportional, to, cross, sectional, area, resistive, power, loss, is, only, reduced, proportionally, with, increasing, cross, sectional, area, providing, a, much, smaller, benefit, than, the, squared, reduction, provided, by, multiplying, the, voltage, long, distance, transmission, is, typically, done, with, overhead, lines, at, voltages, of, 115, to, 1, 200, kv, at, higher, voltages, where, more, than, 2, 000, kv, exists, between, conductor, and, ground, corona, discharge, losses, are, so, large, that, they, can, offset, the, lower, resistive, losses, in, the, line, conductors, measures, to, reduce, corona, losses, include, larger, conductor, diameter, hollow, cores, or, conductor, bundles, factors, that, affect, resistance, and, thus, loss, include, temperature, spiraling, and, the, skin, effect, resistance, increases, with, temperature, spiraling, which, refers, to, the, way, stranded, conductors, spiral, about, the, center, also, contributes, to, increases, in, conductor, resistance, the, skin, effect, causes, the, effective, resistance, to, increase, at, higher, ac, frequencies, corona, and, resistive, losses, can, be, estimated, using, a, mathematical, model, us, transmission, and, distribution, losses, were, estimated, at, 6, 6, in, 1997, 6, 5, in, 2007, and, 5, from, 2013, to, 2019, in, general, losses, are, estimated, from, the, discrepancy, between, power, produced, as, reported, by, power, plants, and, power, sold, the, difference, constitutes, transmission, and, distribution, losses, assuming, no, utility, theft, occurs, as, of, 1980, the, longest, cost, effective, distance, for, dc, transmission, was, 7, 000, kilometres, 4, 300, miles, for, ac, it, was, 4, 000, kilometres, 2, 500, miles, though, us, transmission, lines, are, substantially, shorter, in, any, ac, line, conductor, inductance, and, capacitance, can, be, significant, currents, that, flow, solely, in, reaction, to, these, properties, which, together, with, the, resistance, define, the, impedance, constitute, reactive, power, flow, which, transmits, no, power, to, the, load, these, reactive, currents, however, cause, extra, heating, losses, the, ratio, of, real, power, transmitted, to, the, load, to, apparent, power, the, product, of, a, circuit, s, voltage, and, current, without, reference, to, phase, angle, is, the, power, factor, as, reactive, current, increases, reactive, power, increases, and, power, factor, decreases, for, transmission, systems, with, low, power, factor, losses, are, higher, than, for, systems, with, high, power, factor, utilities, add, capacitor, banks, reactors, and, other, components, such, as, phase, shifters, static, var, compensators, and, flexible, ac, transmission, systems, facts, throughout, the, system, help, to, compensate, for, the, reactive, power, flow, reduce, the, losses, in, power, transmission, and, stabilize, system, voltages, these, measures, are, collectively, called, reactive, support, current, flowing, through, transmission, lines, induces, a, magnetic, field, that, surrounds, the, lines, of, each, phase, and, affects, the, inductance, of, the, surrounding, conductors, of, other, phases, the, conductors, mutual, inductance, is, partially, dependent, on, the, physical, orientation, of, the, lines, with, respect, to, each, other, three, phase, lines, are, conventionally, strung, with, phases, separated, vertically, the, mutual, inductance, seen, by, a, conductor, of, the, phase, in, the, middle, of, the, other, two, phases, is, different, from, the, inductance, seen, on, the, top, bottom, unbalanced, inductance, among, the, three, conductors, is, problematic, because, it, may, force, the, middle, line, to, carry, a, disproportionate, amount, of, the, total, power, transmitted, similarly, an, unbalanced, load, may, occur, if, one, line, is, consistently, closest, to, the, ground, and, operates, at, a, lower, impedance, because, of, this, phenomenon, conductors, must, be, periodically, transposed, along, the, line, so, that, each, phase, sees, equal, time, in, each, relative, position, to, balance, out, the, mutual, inductance, seen, by, all, three, phases, to, accomplish, this, line, position, is, swapped, at, specially, designed, transposition, towers, at, regular, intervals, along, the, line, using, various, transposition, schemes, subtransmission, runs, at, relatively, lower, voltages, it, is, uneconomical, to, connect, all, distribution, substations, to, the, high, main, transmission, voltage, because, that, equipment, is, larger, and, more, expensive, typically, only, larger, substations, connect, with, this, high, voltage, voltage, is, stepped, down, before, the, current, is, sent, to, smaller, substations, subtransmission, circuits, are, usually, arranged, in, loops, so, that, a, single, line, failure, does, not, stop, service, to, many, customers, for, more, than, a, short, time, loops, can, be, normally, closed, where, loss, of, one, circuit, should, result, in, no, interruption, or, normally, open, where, substations, can, switch, to, a, backup, supply, while, subtransmission, circuits, are, usually, carried, on, overhead, lines, in, urban, areas, buried, cable, may, be, used, the, lower, voltage, subtransmission, lines, use, less, right, of, way, and, simpler, structures, undergrounding, is, less, difficult, no, fixed, cutoff, separates, subtransmission, and, transmission, or, subtransmission, and, distribution, their, voltage, ranges, overlap, voltages, of, 69, kv, 115, kv, and, 138, kv, are, often, used, for, subtransmission, in, north, america, as, power, systems, evolved, voltages, formerly, used, for, transmission, were, used, for, subtransmission, and, subtransmission, voltages, became, distribution, voltages, like, transmission, subtransmission, moves, relatively, large, amounts, of, power, and, like, distribution, subtransmission, covers, an, area, instead, of, just, point, to, point, substation, transformers, reduce, the, voltage, to, a, lower, level, for, distribution, to, customers, this, distribution, is, accomplished, with, a, combination, of, sub, transmission, 33, to, 138, kv, and, distribution, 3, 3, to, 25, kv, finally, at, the, point, of, use, the, energy, is, transformed, to, end, user, voltage, 100, to, 4160, volts, high, voltage, power, transmission, allows, for, lesser, resistive, losses, over, long, distances, this, efficiency, delivers, a, larger, proportion, of, the, generated, power, to, the, loads, in, a, simplified, model, the, grid, delivers, electricity, from, an, ideal, voltage, source, with, voltage, v, displaystyle, v, delivering, a, power, p, v, displaystyle, p, v, to, a, single, point, of, consumption, modelled, by, a, resistance, r, displaystyle, r, when, the, wires, are, long, enough, to, have, a, significant, resistance, r, c, displaystyle, r, c, if, the, resistances, are, in, series, with, no, intervening, transformer, the, circuit, acts, as, a, voltage, divider, because, the, same, current, i, v, r, r, c, displaystyle, i, frac, v, r, r, c, runs, through, the, wire, resistance, and, the, powered, device, as, a, consequence, the, useful, power, at, the, point, of, consumption, is, should, an, ideal, transformer, convert, high, voltage, low, current, electricity, into, low, voltage, high, current, electricity, with, a, voltage, ratio, of, a, displaystyle, a, i, e, the, voltage, is, divided, by, a, displaystyle, a, and, the, current, is, multiplied, by, a, displaystyle, a, in, the, secondary, branch, compared, to, the, primary, branch, then, the, circuit, is, again, equivalent, to, a, voltage, divider, but, the, wires, now, have, apparent, resistance, of, only, r, c, a, 2, displaystyle, r, c, a, 2, the, useful, power, is, then, for, a, 1, displaystyle, a, 1, i,

fraction, is, lost, to, joule, heating, the, terminal, characteristics, of, the, transmission, line, are, the, voltage, and, current, at, the, sending, s, and, receiving, r, ends, the, transmission, line, can, be, modeled, as, a, black, box, and, a, 2, by, 2, transmission, matrix, is, used, to, model, its, behavior, as, follows, the, line, is, assumed, to, be, a, reciprocal, symmetrical, network, meaning, that, the, receiving, and, sending, labels, can, be, switched, with, no, consequence, the, transmission, matrix, t, has, the, properties, the, parameters, a, b, c, and, d, differ, depending, on, how, the, desired, model, handles, the, line, s, resistance, r, inductance, l, capacitance, c, and, shunt, parallel, leak, conductance, g, the, four, main, models, are, the, short, line, approximation, the, medium, line, approximation, the, long, line, approximation, with, distributed, parameters, and, the, lossless, line, in, such, models, a, capital, letter, such, as, r, refers, to, the, total, quantity, summed, over, the, line, and, a, lowercase, letter, such, as, c, refers, to, the, per, unit, length, quantity, the, lossless, line, approximation, is, the, least, accurate, it, is, typically, used, on, short, lines, where, the, inductance, is, much, greater, than, the, resistance, for, this, approximation, the, voltage, and, current, are, identical, at, the, sending, and, receiving, ends, the, characteristic, impedance, is, pure, real, which, means, resistive, for, that, impedance, and, it, is, often, called, surge, impedance, when, a, lossless, line, is, terminated, by, surge, impedance, the, voltage, does, not, drop, though, the, phase, angles, of, voltage, and, current, are, rotated, the, magnitudes, of, voltage, and, current, remain, constant, along, the, line, for, load, sil, the, voltage, drops, from, sending, end, and, the, line, consumes, vars, for, load, sil, the, voltage, increases, from, the, sending, end, and, the, line, generates, vars, the, short, line, approximation, is, normally, used, for, lines, shorter, than, 80, km, 50, mi, there, only, a, series, impedance, z, is, considered, while, c, and, g, are, ignored, the, final, result, is, that, a, d, 1, per, unit, b, z, ohms, and, c, 0, the, associated, transition, matrix, for, this, approximation, is, therefore, the, medium, line, approximation, is, used, for, lines, running, between, 80, and, 250, km, 50, and, 155, mi, the, series, impedance, and, the, shunt, current, leak, conductance, are, considered, placing, half, of, the, shunt, conductance, at, each, end, of, the, line, this, circuit, is, often, referred, to, as, a, nominal, pi, circuit, because, of, the, shape, that, is, taken, on, when, leak, conductance, is, placed, on, both, sides, of, the, circuit, diagram, the, analysis, of, the, medium, line, produces, counterintuitive, behaviors, of, medium, length, transmission, lines, the, long, line, model, is, used, when, a, higher, degree, of, accuracy, is, needed, or, when, the, line, under, consideration, is, more, than, 250, km, 160, mi, long, series, resistance, and, shunt, conductance, are, considered, to, be, distributed, parameters, such, that, each, differential, length, of, the, line, has, a, corresponding, differential, series, impedance, and, shunt, admittance, the, following, result, can, be, applied, at, any, point, along, the, transmission, line, where, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, propagation, constant, to, find, the, voltage, and, current, at, the, end, of, the, long, line, x, displaystyle, x, should, be, replaced, with, l, displaystyle, l, the, line, length, in, all, parameters, of, the, transmission, matrix, this, model, applies, the, telegrapher, s, equations, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, is, used, to, transmit, large, amounts, of, power, over, long, distances, or, for, interconnections, between, asynchronous, grids, when, electrical, energy, is, transmitted, over, very, long, distances, the, power, lost, in, ac, transmission, becomes, appreciable, and, it, is, less, expensive, to, use, direct, current, instead, for, a, long, transmission, line, these, lower, losses, and, reduced, construction, cost, of, a, dc, line, can, offset, the, cost, of, the, required, converter, stations, at, each, end, hvdc, is, used, for, long, submarine, cables, where, ac, cannot, be, used, because, of, cable, capacitance, in, these, cases, special, high, voltage, cables, are, used, submarine, hvdc, systems, are, often, used, to, interconnect, the, electricity, grids, of, islands, for, example, between, great, britain, and, continental, europe, between, great, britain, and, ireland, between, tasmania, and, the, australian, mainland, between, the, north, and, south, islands, of, new, zealand, between, new, jersey, and, new, york, city, and, between, new, jersey, and, long, island, submarine, connections, up, to, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, in, length, have, been, deployed, hvdc, links, can, be, used, to, control, grid, problems, the, power, transmitted, by, an, ac, line, increases, as, the, phase, angle, between, source, end, voltage, and, destination, ends, increases, but, too, large, a, phase, angle, allows, the, systems, at, either, end, to, fall, out, of, step, since, the, power, flow, in, a, dc, link, is, controlled, independently, of, the, phases, of, the, ac, networks, that, it, connects, this, phase, angle, limit, does, not, exist, and, a, dc, link, is, always, able, to, transfer, its, full, rated, power, a, dc, link, therefore, stabilizes, the, ac, grid, at, either, end, since, power, flow, and, phase, angle, can, then, be, controlled, independently, as, an, example, to, adjust, the, flow, of, ac, power, on, a, hypothetical, line, between, seattle, and, boston, would, require, adjustment, of, the, relative, phase, of, the, two, regional, electrical, grids, this, is, an, everyday, occurrence, in, ac, systems, but, one, that, can, become, disrupted, when, ac, system, components, fail, and, place, unexpected, loads, on, the, grid, with, an, hvdc, line, instead, such, an, interconnection, would, and, possibly, in, other, cooperating, cities, along, the, transmission, route, such, a, system, could, be, less, prone, to, failure, if, parts, of, it, were, suddenly, shut, down, one, example, of, a, long, dc, transmission, line, is, the, pacific, dc, intertie, located, in, the, western, united, states, the, amount, of, power, that, can, be, sent, over, a, transmission, line, varies, with, the, length, of, the, line, the, heating, of, short, line, conductors, due, to, line, losses, sets, a, thermal, limit, if, too, much, current, is, drawn, conductors, may, sag, too, close, to, the, ground, or, conductors, and, equipment, may, overheat, for, intermediate, length, lines, on, the, order, of, 100, kilometres, 62, miles, the, limit, is, set, by, the, voltage, drop, in, the, line, for, longer, ac, lines, system, stability, becomes, the, limiting, factor, approximately, the, power, flowing, over, an, ac, line, is, proportional, to, the, cosine, of, the, phase, angle, of, the, voltage, and, current, at, the, ends, this, angle, varies, depending, on, system, loading, it, is, undesirable, for, the, angle, to, approach, 90, degrees, as, the, power, flowing, decreases, while, resistive, losses, remain, the, product, of, line, length, and, maximum, load, is, approximately, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, system, voltage, series, capacitors, or, phase, shifting, transformers, are, used, on, long, lines, to, improve, stability, hvdc, lines, are, restricted, only, by, thermal, and, voltage, drop, limits, since, the, phase, angle, is, not, material, understanding, the, temperature, distribution, along, the, cable, route, became, possible, with, the, introduction, of, distributed, temperature, sensing, dts, systems, that, measure, temperatures, all, along, the, cable, without, them, maximum, current, was,

transmission, system, to, reflect, major, changes, to, its, initial, operating, conditions, some, utilities, have, embraced, reconductoring, to, handle, the, increase, in, electricity, production, reconductoring, is, the, replacement, in, place, of, existing, transmission, lines, with, higher, capacity, lines, adding, transmission, lines, is, difficult, due, to, cost, permit, intervals, and, local, opposition, reconductoring, has, the, potential, to, double, the, amount, of, electricity, that, can, travel, across, a, transmission, line, a, 2024, report, found, the, united, states, behind,
