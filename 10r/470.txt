a, video, camera, is, an, optical, instrument, that, captures, videos, as, opposed, to, a, movie, camera, which, records, images, on, film, video, cameras, were, initially, developed, for, the, television, industry, but, have, since, become, widely, used, for, a, variety, of, other, purposes, video, cameras, are, used, primarily, in, two, modes, the, first, characteristic, of, much, early, broadcasting, is, live, television, where, the, camera, feeds, real, time, images, directly, to, a, screen, for, immediate, observation, a, few, cameras, still, serve, live, television, production, but, most, live, connections, are, for, security, military, tactical, and, industrial, operations, where, surreptitious, or, remote, viewing, is, required, in, the, second, mode, the, images, are, recorded, to, a, storage, device, for, archiving, or, further, processing, for, many, years, videotape, was, the, primary, format, used, for, this, purpose, but, was, gradually, supplanted, by, optical, disc, hard, disk, and, then, flash, memory, recorded, video, is, used, in, television, production, and, more, often, surveillance, and, monitoring, tasks, in, which, unattended, recording, of, a, situation, is, required, for, later, analysis, modern, video, cameras, have, numerous, designs, and, use, the, earliest, video, cameras, were, based, on, the, mechanical, nipkow, disk, and, used, in, experimental, broadcasts, through, the, 1910s, 1930s, all, electronic, designs, based, on, the, video, camera, tube, such, as, vladimir, zworykin, s, iconoscope, and, philo, farnsworth, s, image, dissector, supplanted, the, nipkow, system, by, the, 1930s, these, remained, in, wide, use, until, the, 1980s, when, cameras, based, on, solid, state, image, sensors, such, as, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, and, later, cmos, active, pixel, sensor, cmos, sensor, eliminated, common, problems, with, tube, technologies, such, as, image, burn, in, and, streaking, and, made, digital, video, workflow, practical, since, the, output, of, the, sensor, is, digital, so, it, does, not, need, conversion, from, analog, the, basis, for, solid, state, image, sensors, is, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, technology, which, originates, from, the, invention, of, the, mosfet, mos, field, effect, transistor, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, this, led, to, the, development, of, semiconductor, image, sensors, including, the, ccd, and, later, the, cmos, active, pixel, sensor, the, first, semiconductor, image, sensor, was, the, charge, coupled, device, invented, at, bell, labs, in, 1969, based, on, mos, capacitor, technology, the, nmos, active, pixel, sensor, was, later, invented, at, olympus, in, 1985, which, led, to, the, development, of, the, cmos, active, pixel, sensor, at, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, in, 1993, practical, digital, video, cameras, were, also, enabled, by, advances, in, video, compression, due, to, the, impractically, high, memory, and, bandwidth, requirements, of, uncompressed, video, the, most, important, compression, algorithm, in, this, regard, is, the, discrete, cosine, transform, dct, a, lossy, compression, technique, that, was, first, proposed, in, 1972, practical, digital, video, cameras, were, enabled, by, dct, based, video, compression, standards, including, the, h, 26x, and, mpeg, video, coding, standards, introduced, from, 1988, onwards, the, transition, to, digital, television, gave, a, boost, to, digital, video, cameras, by, the, early, 21st, century, most, video, cameras, were, digital, cameras, with, the, advent, of, digital, video, capture, the, distinction, between, professional, video, cameras, and, movie, cameras, has, disappeared, as, the, intermittent, mechanism, has, become, the, same, nowadays, mid, range, cameras, exclusively, used, for, television, and, other, work, except, movies, are, termed, professional, video, cameras, early, video, could, not, be, directly, recorded, the, first, somewhat, successful, attempt, to, directly, record, video, was, in, 1927, with, john, logie, baird, s, disc, based, phonovision, the, discs, were, unplayable, with, the, technology, of, the, time, although, later, advances, allowed, the, video, to, be, recovered, in, the, 1980s, the, first, experiments, with, using, tape, to, record, a, video, signal, took, place, in, 1951, the, first, commercially, released, system, was, quadruplex, videotape, produced, by, ampex, in, 1956, two, years, later, ampex, introduced, a, system, capable, of, recording, colour, video, the, first, recording, systems, designed, to, be, mobile, and, thus, usable, outside, the, studio, were, the, portapak, systems, starting, with, the, sony, dv, 2400, in, 1967, this, was, followed, in, 1981, by, the, betacam, system, where, the, tape, recorder, was, built, into, the, camera, making, a, camcorder, while, some, video, cameras, have, built, in, lenses, others, use, interchangeable, lenses, connected, via, a, range, of, mounts, some, like, panavision, pv, and, arri, pl, are, designed, for, movie, cameras, while, others, like, canon, ef, and, sony, e, come, from, still, photography, a, further, set, of, mounts, like, s, mount, exist, for, applications, like, cctv
