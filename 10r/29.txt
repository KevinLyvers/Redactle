https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer
a, fertilizer, american, english, or, fertiliser, british, english, is, any, material, of, natural, or, synthetic, origin, that, is, applied, to, soil, or, to, plant, tissues, to, supply, plant, nutrients, fertilizers, may, be, distinct, from, liming, materials, or, other, non, nutrient, soil, amendments, many, sources, of, fertilizer, exist, both, natural, and, industrially, produced, for, most, modern, agricultural, practices, fertilization, focuses, on, three, main, macro, nutrients, nitrogen, n, phosphorus, p, and, potassium, k, with, occasional, addition, of, supplements, like, rock, flour, for, micronutrients, farmers, apply, these, fertilizers, in, a, variety, of, ways, through, dry, or, pelletized, or, liquid, application, processes, using, large, agricultural, equipment, or, hand, tool, methods, historically, fertilization, came, from, natural, or, organic, sources, compost, animal, manure, human, manure, harvested, minerals, crop, rotations, and, byproducts, of, human, nature, industries, e, g, fish, processing, waste, or, bloodmeal, from, animal, slaughter, however, starting, in, the, 19th, century, after, innovations, in, plant, nutrition, an, agricultural, industry, developed, around, synthetically, created, fertilizers, this, transition, was, important, in, transforming, the, global, food, system, allowing, for, larger, scale, industrial, agriculture, with, large, crop, yields, nitrogen, fixing, chemical, processes, such, as, the, haber, process, invented, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, amplified, by, production, capacity, created, during, world, war, ii, led, to, a, boom, in, using, nitrogen, fertilizers, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, increased, use, of, nitrogen, fertilizers, 800, increase, between, 1961, and, 2019, has, been, a, crucial, component, of, the, increased, productivity, of, conventional, food, systems, more, than, 30, per, capita, as, part, of, the, so, called, green, revolution, the, use, of, artificial, and, industrially, applied, fertilizers, has, caused, environmental, consequences, such, as, water, pollution, and, eutrophication, due, to, nutritional, runoff, carbon, and, other, emissions, from, fertilizer, production, and, mining, and, contamination, and, pollution, of, soil, various, sustainable, agriculture, practices, can, be, implemented, to, reduce, the, adverse, environmental, effects, of, fertilizer, and, pesticide, use, and, environmental, damage, caused, by, industrial, agriculture, management, of, soil, fertility, has, preoccupied, farmers, since, the, beginning, of, agriculture, middle, eastern, chinese, mesoamerican, and, cultures, of, the, central, andes, were, all, early, adopters, of, agriculture, this, is, thought, to, have, led, to, their, cultures, growing, faster, in, population, which, allowed, an, exportation, of, culture, to, neighboring, hunter, gatherer, groups, fertilizer, use, along, with, agriculture, allowed, some, of, these, early, societies, a, critical, advantage, over, their, neighbors, leading, them, to, become, dominant, cultures, in, their, respective, regions, p, bellwood, 2023, egyptians, romans, babylonians, and, early, germans, are, all, recorded, as, using, minerals, or, manure, to, enhance, the, productivity, of, their, farms, the, scientific, research, of, plant, nutrition, started, well, before, the, work, of, german, chemist, justus, von, liebig, although, his, name, is, most, mentioned, as, the, father, of, the, fertilizer, industry, nicolas, th, odore, de, saussure, and, scientific, colleagues, at, the, time, were, quick, to, disprove, the, simplifications, of, von, liebig, prominent, scientists, whom, von, liebig, drew, were, carl, ludwig, sprenger, and, hermann, hellriegel, in, this, field, a, knowledge, erosion, took, place, partly, driven, by, an, intermingling, of, economics, and, research, john, bennet, lawes, an, english, entrepreneur, began, experimenting, on, the, effects, of, various, manures, on, plants, growing, in, pots, in, 1837, and, a, year, or, two, later, the, experiments, were, extended, to, crops, in, the, field, one, immediate, consequence, was, that, in, 1842, he, patented, a, manure, formed, by, treating, phosphates, with, sulfuric, acid, and, thus, was, the, first, to, create, the, artificial, manure, industry, in, the, succeeding, year, he, enlisted, the, services, of, joseph, henry, gilbert, together, they, performed, crop, experiments, at, the, institute, of, arable, crops, research, the, birkeland, eyde, process, was, one, of, the, competing, industrial, processes, at, the, beginning, of, nitrogen, based, fertilizer, production, this, process, was, used, to, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, n, 2, into, nitric, acid, hno, 3, one, of, several, chemical, processes, called, nitrogen, fixation, the, resultant, nitric, acid, was, then, used, as, a, source, of, nitrate, no, 3, a, factory, based, on, the, process, was, built, in, rjukan, and, notodden, in, norway, and, large, hydroelectric, power, facilities, were, built, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, witnessed, the, rise, of, the, haber, process, and, the, ostwald, process, the, haber, process, produces, ammonia, nh, 3, from, methane, ch, 4, natural, gas, gas, and, molecular, nitrogen, n, 2, from, the, air, the, ammonia, from, the, haber, process, is, then, partially, converted, into, nitric, acid, hno, 3, in, the, ostwald, process, it, is, estimated, that, a, third, of, annual, global, food, production, uses, ammonia, from, the, haber, bosch, process, and, that, this, supports, nearly, half, the, world, s, population, after, world, war, ii, nitrogen, production, plants, that, had, ramped, up, for, wartime, bomb, manufacturing, were, pivoted, towards, agricultural, uses, the, use, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizers, has, increased, steadily, over, the, last, 50, years, rising, almost, 20, fold, to, the, current, rate, of, 100, million, tonnes, of, nitrogen, per, year, the, development, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizers, has, significantly, supported, global, population, growth, it, has, been, estimated, that, almost, half, the, people, on, the, earth, are, currently, fed, due, to, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, use, the, use, of, phosphate, fertilizers, has, also, increased, from, 9, million, tonnes, per, year, in, 1960, to, 40, million, tonnes, per, year, in, 2000, agricultural, use, of, inorganic, fertilizers, in, 2021, was, 195, million, tonnes, of, nutrients, of, which, 56, was, nitrogen, asia, represented, 53, of, the, world, s, total, agricultural, use, of, inorganic, fertilizers, in, 2021, followed, by, the, americas, 29, europe, 12, africa, 4, and, oceania, 2, this, ranking, of, the, regions, is, the, same, for, all, nutrients, the, main, users, of, inorganic, fertilizers, are, in, descending, order, china, india, brazil, and, the, united, states, of, america, see, table, 15, with, china, the, largest, user, of, each, nutrient, a, maize, crop, yielding, 6, 9, tonnes, of, grain, per, hectare, 2, 5, acres, requires, 31, 50, kilograms, 68, 110, lb, of, phosphate, fertilizer, to, be, applied, soybean, crops, require, about, half, 20, 25, kg, per, hectare, yara, international, is, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, fertilizers, enhance, the, growth, of, plants, this, goal, is, met, in, two, ways, the, traditional, one, being, additives, that, provide, nutrients, the, second, mode, by, which, some, fertilizers, act, is, to, enhance, the, effectiveness, of, the, soil, by, modifying, its, water, retention, and, aeration, this, article, like, many, on, fertilizers, emphasizes, the, nutritional, aspect, fertilizers, typically, provide, in, varying, proportions, the, nutrients, required, for, healthy, plant, life, are, classified, according, to, the, elements, but, the, elements, are, not, used, as, fertilizers, instead, compounds, containing, these, elements, are, the, basis, of, fertilizers, the, macro, nutrients, are, consumed, in, larger, quantities, and, are, present, in, plant, tissue, in, quantities, from, 0, 15, to, 6, 0, on, a, dry, matter, dm, 0, moisture, basis, plants, are, made, up, of, four, main, elements, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, are, widely, available, respectively, in, carbon, dioxide, and, in, water, although, nitrogen, makes, up, most, of, the, atmosphere, it, is, in, a, form, that, is, unavailable, to, plants, nitrogen, is, the, most, important, fertilizer, since, nitrogen, is, present, in, proteins, amide, bonds, between, amino, acids, dna, puric, and, pyrimidic, bases, and, other, components, e, g, tetrapyrrolic, heme, in, chlorophyll, to, be, nutritious, to, plants, nitrogen, must, be, made, available, in, a, fixed, form, only, some, bacteria, and, their, host, plants, notably, legumes, can, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, n, 2, by, converting, it, to, ammonia, nh, 3, phosphate, po, 3, 4, is, required, for, the, production, of, dna, genetic, code, and, atp, the, main, energy, carrier, in, cells, as, well, as, certain, lipids, phospholipids, the, main, components, of, the, lipidic, double, layer, of, the, cell, membranes, two, sets, of, enzymatic, reactions, are, highly, relevant, to, the, efficiency, of, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, the, first, is, the, hydrolysis, reaction, with, water, of, urea, co, nh, 2, 2, many, soil, bacteria, possess, the, enzyme, urease, which, catalyzes, the, conversion, of, urea, to, ammonium, ion, nh, 4, and, bicarbonate, ion, hco, 3, ammonia, oxidizing, bacteria, aob, such, as, species, of, nitrosomonas, oxidize, ammonia, nh, 3, to, nitrite, no, 2, a, process, termed, nitrification, nitrite, oxidizing, bacteria, especially, nitrobacter, oxidize, nitrite, no, 2, to, nitrate, no, 3, which, is, extremely, soluble, and, mobile, and, is, a, major, cause, of, eutrophication, and, algal, bloom, fertilizers, are, classified, in, several, ways, they, are, classified, according, to, whether, they, provide, a, single, nutrient, e, g, k, p, or, n, in, which, case, they, are, classified, as, straight, fertilizers, multinutrient, fertilizers, or, complex, fertilizers, provide, two, or, more, nutrients, for, example, n, and, p, fertilizers, are, also, sometimes, classified, as, inorganic, the, topic, of, most, of, this, article, versus, organic, inorganic, fertilizers, exclude, carbon, containing, materials, except, ureas, organic, fertilizers, are, usually, recycled, plant, or, animal, derived, matter, inorganic, are, sometimes, called, synthetic, fertilizers, since, various, chemical, treatments, are, required, for, their, manufacture, the, main, nitrogen, based, straight, fertilizer, is, ammonia, nh, 3, ammonium, nh, 4, or, its, solutions, including, the, main, straight, phosphate, fertilizers, are, the, superphosphates, a, mixture, of, single, superphosphate, and, triple, superphosphate, is, called, double, superphosphate, more, than, 90, of, a, typical, superphosphate, fertilizer, is, water, soluble, the, main, potassium, based, straight, fertilizer, is, muriate, of, potash, mop, 95, 99, kcl, it, is, typically, available, as, 0, 0, 60, or, 0, 0, 62, fertilizer, these, fertilizers, are, common, they, consist, of, two, or, more, nutrient, components, major, two, component, fertilizers, provide, both, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, to, the, plants, these, are, called, np, fertilizers, the, main, np, fertilizers, are, npk, fertilizers, are, three, component, fertilizers, providing, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, there, exist, two, types, of, npk, fertilizers, compound, and, blends, compound, npk, fertilizers, contain, chemically, bound, ingredients, while, blended, npk, fertilizers, are, physical, mixtures, of, single, nutrient, components, npk, rating, is, a, rating, system, describing, the, amount, of, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, in, a, fertilizer, npk, ratings, consist, of, three, numbers, separated, by, dashes, e, g, 10, 10, 10, or, 16, 4, 8, describing, the, chemical, content, of, fertilizers, the, first, number, represents, the, percentage, of, nitrogen, in, the, product, the, second, number, p, 2, o, 5, the, third, k, 2, o, fertilizers, do, not, actually, contain, p, 2, o, 5, or, k, 2, o, but, the, system, is, a, conventional, shorthand, for, the, amount, of, the, phosphorus, p, or, potassium, k, in, a, fertilizer, a, 50, pound, 23, kg, bag, of, fertilizer, labeled, 16, 4, 8, contains, 8, lb, 3, 6, kg, of, nitrogen, 16, of, the, 50, pounds, an, amount, of, phosphorus, equivalent, to, that, in, 2, pounds, of, p, 2, o, 5, 4, of, 50, pounds, and, 4, pounds, of, k, 2, o, 8, of, 50, pounds, most, fertilizers, are, labeled, according, to, this, n, p, k, convention, although, australian, convention, following, an, n, p, k, s, system, adds, a, fourth, number, for, sulfur, and, uses, elemental, values, for, all, values, including, p, and, k, micronutrients, are, consumed, in, smaller, quantities, and, are, present, in, plant, tissue, on, the, order, of, parts, per, million, ppm, ranging, from, 0, 15, to, 400, ppm, or, less, than, 0, 04, dry, matter, these, elements, are, often, required, for, enzymes, essential, to, the, plant, s, metabolism, because, these, elements, enable, catalysts, enzymes, their, impact, far, exceeds, their, weight, age, typical, micronutrients, are, boron, zinc, molybdenum, iron, and, manganese, these, elements, are, provided, as, water, soluble, salts, iron, presents, special, problems, because, it, converts, to, insoluble, bio, unavailable, compounds, at, moderate, soil, ph, and, phosphate, concentrations, for, this, reason, iron, is, often, administered, as, a, chelate, complex, e, g, the, edta, or, eddha, derivatives, the, micronutrient, needs, depend, on, the, plant, and, the, environment, for, example, sugar, beets, appear, to, require, boron, and, legumes, require, cobalt, while, environmental, conditions, such, as, heat, or, drought, make, boron, less, available, for, plants, the, production, of, synthetic, or, inorganic, fertilizers, require, prepared, chemicals, whereas, organic, fertilizers, are, derived, from, the, organic, processes, of, plants, and, animals, in, biological, processes, using, biochemicals, nitrogen, fertilizers, are, made, from, ammonia, nh, 3, produced, by, the, haber, bosch, process, in, this, energy, intensive, process, natural, gas, ch, 4, usually, supplies, the, hydrogen, and, the, nitrogen, n, 2, is, derived, from, the, air, this, ammonia, is, used, as, a, feedstock, for, all, other, nitrogen, fertilizers, such, as, anhydrous, ammonium, nitrate, nh, 4, no, 3, and, urea, co, nh, 2, 2, deposits, of, sodium, nitrate, nano, 3, chilean, saltpeter, are, also, found, in, the, atacama, desert, in, chile, and, was, one, of, the, original, 1830, nitrogen, rich, fertilizers, used, it, is, still, mined, for, fertilizer, nitrates, are, also, produced, from, ammonia, by, the, ostwald, process, phosphate, fertilizers, are, obtained, by, extraction, from, phosphate, rock, which, contains, two, principal, phosphorus, containing, minerals, fluorapatite, ca, 5, po, 4, 3, f, cfa, and, hydroxyapatite, ca, 5, po, 4, 3, oh, billions, of, kg, of, phosphate, rock, are, mined, annually, but, the, size, and, quality, of, the, remaining, ore, is, decreasing, these, minerals, are, converted, into, water, soluble, phosphate, salts, by, treatment, with, acids, the, large, production, of, sulfuric, acid, is, primarily, motivated, by, this, application, in, the, nitrophosphate, process, or, odda, process, invented, in, 1927, phosphate, rock, with, up, to, a, 20, phosphorus, p, content, is, dissolved, with, nitric, acid, hno, 3, to, produce, a, mixture, of, phosphoric, acid, h, 3, po, 4, and, calcium, nitrate, ca, no, 3, 2, this, mixture, can, be, combined, with, a, potassium, fertilizer, to, produce, a, compound, fertilizer, with, the, three, macronutrients, n, p, and, k, in, easily, dissolved, form, potash, is, a, mixture, of, potassium, minerals, used, to, make, potassium, chemical, symbol, k, fertilizers, potash, is, soluble, in, water, so, the, main, effort, in, producing, this, nutrient, from, the, ore, involves, some, purification, steps, e, g, to, remove, sodium, chloride, nacl, common, salt, sometimes, potash, is, referred, to, as, k, 2, o, as, a, matter, of, convenience, to, those, describing, the, potassium, content, in, fact, potash, fertilizers, are, usually, potassium, chloride, potassium, sulfate, potassium, carbonate, or, potassium, nitrate, there, are, three, major, routes, for, manufacturing, npk, fertilizers, named, for, their, main, ingredients, nitrogen, n, phosphorus, p, and, potassium, k, step, 2, removal, of, calcium, nitrate, it, is, important, to, remove, the, calcium, nitrate, because, calcium, nitrate, is, extremely, hygroscopic, organic, fertilizers, can, describe, those, fertilizers, with, a, biologic, origin, derived, from, living, or, formerly, living, materials, organic, fertilizers, can, also, describe, commercially, available, and, frequently, packaged, products, that, strive, to, follow, the, expectations, and, restrictions, adopted, by, organic, agriculture, and, environmentally, friendly, gardening, related, systems, of, food, and, plant, production, that, significantly, limit, or, strictly, avoid, the, use, of, synthetic, fertilizers, and, pesticides, the, organic, fertilizer, products, typically, contain, both, some, organic, materials, as, well, as, acceptable, additives, such, as, nutritive, rock, powders, ground, seashells, crab, oyster, etc, other, prepared, products, such, as, seed, meal, or, kelp, and, cultivated, microorganisms, and, derivatives, fertilizers, of, an, organic, origin, the, first, definition, include, animal, wastes, plant, wastes, from, agriculture, seaweed, compost, and, treated, sewage, sludge, biosolids, beyond, manures, animal, sources, can, include, products, from, the, slaughter, of, animals, bloodmeal, bone, meal, feather, meal, hides, hoofs, and, horns, all, are, typical, components, organically, derived, materials, available, to, industry, such, as, sewage, sludge, may, not, be, acceptable, components, of, organic, farming, and, gardening, because, of, factors, ranging, from, residual, contaminants, to, public, perception, on, the, other, hand, marketed, organic, fertilizers, may, include, and, promote, processed, organics, because, the, materials, have, consumer, appeal, no, matter, the, definition, nor, composition, most, of, these, products, contain, less, concentrated, nutrients, and, the, nutrients, are, not, as, easily, quantified, they, can, offer, soil, building, advantages, as, well, as, be, appealing, to, those, who, are, trying, to, farm, garden, more, naturally, in, terms, of, volume, peat, is, the, most, widely, used, packaged, organic, soil, amendment, it, is, an, immature, form, of, coal, and, improves, the, soil, by, aeration, and, absorbing, water, but, confers, no, nutritional, value, to, the, plants, it, is, therefore, not, a, fertilizer, as, defined, in, the, beginning, of, the, article, but, rather, an, amendment, coir, derived, from, coconut, husks, bark, and, sawdust, when, added, to, soil, all, act, similarly, but, not, identically, to, peat, and, are, also, considered, organic, soil, amendments, or, texturizers, because, of, their, limited, nutritive, inputs, some, organic, additives, can, have, a, reverse, effect, on, nutrients, fresh, sawdust, can, consume, soil, nutrients, as, it, breaks, down, and, may, lower, soil, ph, but, these, same, organic, texturizers, as, well, as, compost, etc, may, increase, the, availability, of, nutrients, through, improved, cation, exchange, or, through, increased, growth, of, microorganisms, that, in, turn, increase, availability, of, certain, plant, nutrients, organic, fertilizers, such, as, composts, and, manures, may, be, distributed, locally, without, going, into, industry, production, making, actual, consumption, more, difficult, to, quantify, china, has, become, the, largest, producer, and, consumer, of, nitrogen, fertilizers, while, africa, has, little, reliance, on, nitrogen, fertilizers, agricultural, and, chemical, minerals, are, very, important, in, industrial, use, of, fertilizers, which, is, valued, at, approximately, 200, billion, nitrogen, has, a, significant, impact, in, the, global, mineral, use, followed, by, potash, and, phosphate, the, production, of, nitrogen, has, drastically, increased, since, the, 1960s, phosphate, and, potash, have, increased, in, price, since, the, 1960s, which, is, larger, than, the, consumer, price, index, potash, is, produced, in, canada, russia, and, belarus, together, making, up, over, half, of, the, world, production, potash, production, in, canada, rose, in, 2017, and, 2018, by, 18, 6, conservative, estimates, report, 30, to, 50, of, crop, yields, are, attributed, to, natural, or, synthetic, commercial, fertilizers, fertilizer, consumption, has, surpassed, the, amount, of, farmland, in, the, united, states, data, on, the, fertilizer, consumption, per, hectare, arable, land, in, 2012, are, published, by, the, world, bank, the, diagram, below, shows, fertilizer, consumption, by, the, european, union, eu, countries, as, kilograms, per, hectare, pounds, per, acre, the, total, consumption, of, fertilizer, in, the, eu, is, 15, 9, million, tons, for, 105, million, hectare, arable, land, area, or, 107, million, hectare, arable, land, according, to, another, estimate, this, figure, equates, to, 151, kg, of, fertilizers, consumed, per, ha, arable, land, on, average, by, the, eu, countries, fertilizers, are, commonly, used, for, growing, all, crops, with, application, rates, depending, on, the, soil, fertility, usually, as, measured, by, a, soil, test, and, according, to, the, particular, crop, legumes, for, example, fix, nitrogen, from, the, atmosphere, and, generally, do, not, require, nitrogen, fertilizer, fertilizers, are, applied, to, crops, both, as, solids, and, as, liquid, about, 90, of, fertilizers, are, applied, as, solids, the, most, widely, used, solid, inorganic, fertilizers, are, urea, diammonium, phosphate, and, potassium, chloride, solid, fertilizer, is, typically, granulated, or, powdered, often, solids, are, available, as, prills, a, solid, globule, liquid, fertilizers, comprise, anhydrous, ammonia, aqueous, solutions, of, ammonia, aqueous, solutions, of, ammonium, nitrate, or, urea, these, concentrated, products, may, be, diluted, with, water, to, form, a, concentrated, liquid, fertilizer, e, g, uan, advantages, of, liquid, fertilizer, are, its, more, rapid, effect, and, easier, coverage, the, addition, of, fertilizer, to, irrigation, water, is, called, fertigation, granulated, fertilizers, are, more, economical, to, ship, and, store, not, to, mention, easier, to, apply, urea, is, highly, soluble, in, water, and, is, therefore, also, very, suitable, for, use, in, fertilizer, solutions, in, combination, with, ammonium, nitrate, uan, e, g, in, foliar, feed, fertilizers, for, fertilizer, use, granules, are, preferred, over, prills, because, of, their, narrower, particle, size, distribution, which, is, an, advantage, for, mechanical, application, urea, is, usually, spread, at, rates, of, between, 40, and, 300, kg, ha, 35, to, 270, lbs, acre, but, rates, vary, smaller, applications, incur, lower, losses, due, to, leaching, during, summer, urea, is, often, spread, just, before, or, during, rain, to, minimize, losses, from, volatilization, a, process, wherein, nitrogen, is, lost, to, the, atmosphere, as, ammonia, gas, because, of, the, high, nitrogen, concentration, in, urea, it, is, very, important, to, achieve, an, even, spread, drilling, must, not, occur, on, contact, with, or, close, to, seed, due, to, the, risk, of, germination, damage, urea, dissolves, in, water, for, application, as, a, spray, or, through, irrigation, systems, in, grain, and, cotton, crops, urea, is, often, applied, at, the, time, of, the, last, cultivation, before, planting, in, high, rainfall, areas, and, on, sandy, soils, where, nitrogen, can, be, lost, through, leaching, and, where, good, in, season, rainfall, is, expected, urea, can, be, side, or, top, dressed, during, the, growing, season, top, dressing, is, also, popular, on, pasture, and, forage, crops, in, cultivating, sugarcane, urea, is, side, dressed, after, planting, and, applied, to, each, ratoon, crop, because, it, absorbs, moisture, from, the, atmosphere, urea, is, often, stored, in, closed, containers, overdose, or, placing, urea, near, seed, is, harmful, foliar, fertilizers, are, applied, directly, to, leaves, this, method, is, almost, invariably, used, to, apply, water, soluble, straight, nitrogen, fertilizers, and, used, especially, for, high, value, crops, such, as, fruits, urea, is, the, most, common, foliar, fertilizer, various, chemicals, are, used, to, enhance, the, efficiency, of, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, in, this, way, farmers, can, limit, the, polluting, effects, of, nitrogen, run, off, nitrification, inhibitors, also, known, as, nitrogen, stabilizers, suppress, the, conversion, of, ammonia, into, nitrate, an, anion, that, is, more, prone, to, leaching, 1, carbamoyl, 3, methylpyrazole, cmp, dicyandiamide, nitrapyrin, 2, chloro, 6, trichloromethylpyridine, and, 3, 4, dimethylpyrazole, phosphate, dmpp, are, popular, urease, inhibitors, are, used, to, slow, the, hydrolytic, conversion, of, urea, into, ammonia, which, is, prone, to, evaporation, as, well, as, nitrification, the, conversion, of, urea, to, ammonia, catalyzed, by, enzymes, called, ureases, a, popular, inhibitor, of, ureases, is, n, n, butyl, thiophosphoric, triamide, nbpt, careful, use, of, fertilization, technologies, is, important, because, excess, nutrients, can, be, detrimental, fertilizer, burn, can, occur, when, too, much, fertilizer, is, applied, resulting, in, damage, or, even, death, of, the, plant, fertilizers, vary, in, their, tendency, to, burn, roughly, in, accordance, with, their, salt, index, synthetic, fertilizer, used, in, agriculture, has, wide, reaching, environmental, consequences, according, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, special, report, on, climate, change, and, land, production, of, these, fertilizers, and, associated, land, use, practices, are, drivers, of, global, warming, the, use, of, fertilizer, has, also, led, to, a, number, of, direct, environmental, consequences, agricultural, runoff, which, leads, to, downstream, effects, like, ocean, dead, zones, and, waterway, contamination, soil, microbiome, degradation, and, accumulation, of, toxins, in, ecosystems, indirect, environmental, impacts, include, the, environmental, impacts, of, fracking, for, natural, gas, used, in, the, haber, process, the, agricultural, boom, is, partially, responsible, for, the, rapid, growth, in, human, population, and, large, scale, industrial, agricultural, practices, are, associated, with, habitat, destruction, pressure, on, biodiversity, and, agricultural, soil, loss, in, order, to, mitigate, environmental, and, food, security, concerns, the, international, community, has, included, food, systems, in, sustainable, development, goal, 2, which, focuses, on, creating, a, climate, friendly, and, sustainable, food, production, system, most, policy, and, regulatory, approaches, to, address, these, issues, focus, on, pivoting, agricultural, practices, towards, sustainable, or, regenerative, agricultural, practices, these, use, less, synthetic, fertilizers, better, soil, management, for, example, no, till, agriculture, and, more, organic, fertilizers, for, each, ton, of, phosphoric, acid, produced, by, the, processing, of, phosphate, rock, five, tons, of, waste, are, generated, this, waste, takes, the, form, of, impure, useless, radioactive, solid, called, phosphogypsum, estimates, range, from, 100, 000, 000, and, 280, 000, 000, tons, of, phosphogypsum, waste, produced, annually, worldwide, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, fertilizers, can, affect, soil, surface, water, and, groundwater, due, to, the, dispersion, of, minerals, into, waterways, due, to, high, rainfall, snowmelt, and, can, leaching, into, groundwater, over, time, agricultural, run, off, is, a, major, contributor, to, the, eutrophication, of, freshwater, bodies, for, example, in, the, us, about, half, of, all, the, lakes, are, eutrophic, the, main, contributor, to, eutrophication, is, phosphate, which, is, normally, a, limiting, nutrient, high, concentrations, promote, the, growth, of, cyanobacteria, and, algae, the, demise, of, which, consumes, oxygen, cyanobacteria, blooms, algal, blooms, can, also, produce, harmful, toxins, that, can, accumulate, in, the, food, chain, and, can, be, harmful, to, humans, fertilizer, run, off, can, be, reduced, by, using, weather, optimized, fertilization, strategies, the, nitrogen, rich, compounds, found, in, fertilizer, runoff, are, the, primary, cause, of, serious, oxygen, depletion, in, many, parts, of, oceans, especially, in, coastal, zones, lakes, and, rivers, the, resulting, lack, of, dissolved, oxygen, greatly, reduces, the, ability, of, these, areas, to, sustain, oceanic, fauna, the, number, of, oceanic, dead, zones, near, inhabited, coastlines, is, increasing, as, of, 2006, the, application, of, nitrogen, fertilizer, is, being, increasingly, controlled, in, northwestern, europe, and, the, united, states, in, cases, where, eutrophication, can, be, reversed, it, may, nevertheless, take, decades, and, significant, soil, management, before, the, accumulated, nitrates, in, groundwater, can, be, broken, down, by, natural, processes, only, a, fraction, of, the, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, is, converted, to, plant, matter, the, remainder, accumulates, in, the, soil, or, is, lost, as, run, off, high, application, rates, of, nitrogen, containing, fertilizers, combined, with, the, high, water, solubility, of, nitrate, leads, to, increased, runoff, into, surface, water, as, well, as, leaching, into, groundwater, thereby, causing, groundwater, pollution, the, excessive, use, of, nitrogen, containing, fertilizers, be, they, synthetic, or, natural, is, particularly, damaging, as, much, of, the, nitrogen, that, is, not, taken, up, by, plants, is, transformed, into, nitrate, which, is, easily, leached, nitrate, levels, above, 10, mg, l, 10, ppm, in, groundwater, can, cause, blue, baby, syndrome, acquired, methemoglobinemia, the, nutrients, especially, nitrates, in, fertilizers, can, cause, problems, for, natural, habitats, and, for, human, health, if, they, are, washed, off, soil, into, watercourses, or, leached, through, soil, into, groundwater, run, off, can, lead, to, fertilizing, blooms, of, algae, that, use, up, all, the, oxygen, and, leave, huge, dead, zones, behind, where, other, fish, and, aquatic, life, can, not, live, soil, acidification, refers, to, the, process, by, which, the, ph, level, of, soil, becomes, more, acidic, over, time, soil, ph, is, a, measure, of, the, soil, s, acidity, or, alkalinity, and, is, determined, on, a, scale, from, 0, to, 14, with, 7, being, neutral, a, ph, value, below, 7, indicates, acidic, soil, while, a, ph, value, above, 7, indicates, alkaline, or, basic, soil, soil, acidification, is, a, significant, concern, in, agriculture, and, horticulture, it, refers, to, the, process, of, the, soil, becoming, more, acidic, over, time, nitrogen, containing, fertilizers, can, cause, soil, acidification, when, added, this, may, lead, to, decrease, in, nutrient, availability, which, may, be, offset, by, liming, these, fertilizers, release, ammonium, or, nitrate, ions, which, can, acidify, the, soil, as, they, undergo, chemical, reactions, when, these, nitrogen, containing, fertilizers, are, added, to, the, soil, they, increase, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, h, in, the, soil, solution, which, lowers, the, ph, of, the, soil, the, concentration, of, cadmium, in, phosphorus, containing, fertilizers, varies, considerably, and, can, be, problematic, for, example, mono, ammonium, phosphate, fertilizer, may, have, a, cadmium, content, of, as, low, as, 0, 14, mg, kg, or, as, high, as, 50, 9, mg, kg, the, phosphate, rock, used, in, their, manufacture, can, contain, as, much, as, 188, mg, kg, cadmium, examples, are, deposits, on, nauru, and, the, christmas, islands, continuous, use, of, high, cadmium, fertilizer, can, contaminate, soil, as, shown, in, new, zealand, and, plants, limits, to, the, cadmium, content, of, phosphate, fertilizers, has, been, considered, by, the, european, commission, producers, of, phosphorus, containing, fertilizers, now, select, phosphate, rock, based, on, the, cadmium, content, phosphate, rocks, contain, high, levels, of, fluoride, consequently, the, widespread, use, of, phosphate, fertilizers, has, increased, soil, fluoride, concentrations, it, has, been, found, that, food, contamination, from, fertilizer, is, of, little, concern, as, plants, accumulate, little, fluoride, from, the, soil, of, greater, concern, is, the, possibility, of, fluoride, toxicity, to, livestock, that, ingest, contaminated, soils, also, of, possible, concern, are, the, effects, of, fluoride, on, soil, microorganisms, the, radioactive, content, of, the, fertilizers, varies, considerably, and, depends, both, on, their, concentrations, in, the, parent, mineral, and, on, the, fertilizer, production, process, uranium, 238, concentrations, can, range, from, 7, to, 100, pci, g, picocuries, per, gram, in, phosphate, rock, and, from, 1, to, 67, pci, g, in, phosphate, fertilizers, where, high, annual, rates, of, phosphorus, fertilizer, are, used, this, can, result, in, uranium, 238, concentrations, in, soils, and, drainage, waters, that, are, several, times, greater, than, are, normally, present, however, the, impact, of, these, increases, on, the, risk, to, human, health, from, radinuclide, contamination, of, foods, is, very, small, less, than, 0, 05, m, sv, y, steel, industry, wastes, recycled, into, fertilizers, for, their, high, levels, of, zinc, essential, to, plant, growth, wastes, can, include, the, following, toxic, metals, lead, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and, nickel, the, most, common, toxic, elements, in, this, type, of, fertilizer, are, mercury, lead, and, arsenic, these, potentially, harmful, impurities, can, be, removed, however, this, significantly, increases, cost, highly, pure, fertilizers, are, widely, available, and, perhaps, best, known, as, the, highly, water, soluble, fertilizers, containing, blue, dyes, used, around, households, such, as, miracle, gro, these, highly, water, soluble, fertilizers, are, used, in, the, plant, nursery, business, and, are, available, in, larger, packages, at, significantly, less, cost, than, retail, quantities, some, inexpensive, retail, granular, garden, fertilizers, are, made, with, high, purity, ingredients, attention, has, been, addressed, to, the, decreasing, concentrations, of, elements, such, as, iron, zinc, copper, and, magnesium, in, many, foods, over, the, last, 50, 60, years, intensive, farming, practices, including, the, use, of, synthetic, fertilizers, are, frequently, suggested, as, reasons, for, these, declines, and, organic, farming, is, often, suggested, as, a, solution, although, improved, crop, yields, resulting, from, npk, fertilizers, are, known, to, dilute, the, concentrations, of, other, nutrients, in, plants, much, of, the, measured, decline, can, be, attributed, to, the, use, of, progressively, higher, yielding, crop, varieties, that, produce, foods, with, lower, mineral, concentrations, than, their, less, productive, ancestors, it, is, therefore, unlikely, that, organic, farming, or, reduced, use, of, fertilizers, will, solve, the, problem, foods, with, high, nutrient, density, are, posited, to, be, achieved, using, older, lower, yielding, varieties, or, the, development, of, new, high, yield, nutrient, dense, varieties, fertilizers, are, in, fact, more, likely, to, solve, trace, mineral, deficiency, problems, than, cause, them, in, western, australia, deficiencies, of, zinc, copper, manganese, iron, and, molybdenum, were, identified, as, limiting, the, growth, of, broad, acre, crops, and, pastures, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, soils, in, western, australia, are, very, old, highly, weathered, and, deficient, in, many, of, the, major, nutrients, and, trace, elements, since, this, time, these, trace, elements, are, routinely, added, to, fertilizers, used, in, agriculture, in, this, state, many, other, soils, around, the, world, are, deficient, in, zinc, leading, to, deficiency, in, both, plants, and, humans, and, zinc, fertilizers, are, widely, used, to, solve, this, problem, high, levels, of, fertilizer, may, cause, the, breakdown, of, the, symbiotic, relationships, between, plant, roots, and, mycorrhizal, fungi, most, fertilizer, is, made, from, dirty, hydrogen, ammonia, is, produced, from, natural, gas, and, air, the, cost, of, natural, gas, makes, up, about, 90, of, the, cost, of, producing, ammonia, the, increase, in, price, of, natural, gases, over, the, past, decade, along, with, other, factors, such, as, increasing, demand, have, contributed, to, an, increase, in, fertilizer, price, the, amount, of, greenhouse, gases, carbon, dioxide, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, produced, during, the, manufacture, and, use, of, nitrogen, fertilizer, is, estimated, as, around, 5, of, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, one, third, is, produced, during, the, production, and, two, thirds, during, the, use, of, fertilizers, nitrogen, fertilizer, can, be, converted, by, soil, bacteria, to, nitrous, oxide, a, greenhouse, gas, nitrous, oxide, emissions, by, humans, most, of, which, are, from, fertilizer, between, 2007, and, 2016, have, been, estimated, at, 7, million, tonnes, per, year, which, is, incompatible, with, limiting, global, warming, to, below, 2, c, through, the, increasing, use, of, nitrogen, fertilizer, which, was, used, at, a, rate, of, about, 110, million, tons, of, n, per, year, in, 2012, adding, to, the, already, existing, amount, of, reactive, nitrogen, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, has, become, the, third, most, important, greenhouse, gas, after, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, it, has, a, global, warming, potential, 296, times, larger, than, an, equal, mass, of, carbon, dioxide, and, it, also, contributes, to, stratospheric, ozone, depletion, by, changing, processes, and, procedures, it, is, possible, to, mitigate, some, but, not, all, of, these, effects, on, anthropogenic, climate, change, methane, emissions, from, crop, fields, notably, rice, paddy, fields, are, increased, by, the, application, of, ammonium, based, fertilizers, these, emissions, contribute, to, global, climate, change, as, methane, is, a, potent, greenhouse, gas, in, europe, problems, with, high, nitrate, concentrations, in, runoff, are, being, addressed, by, the, european, union, s, nitrates, directive, within, britain, farmers, are, encouraged, to, manage, their, land, more, sustainably, in, catchment, sensitive, farming, in, the, us, high, concentrations, of, nitrate, and, phosphorus, in, runoff, and, drainage, water, are, classified, as, nonpoint, source, pollutants, due, to, their, diffuse, origin, this, pollution, is, regulated, at, the, state, level, oregon, and, washington, both, in, the, united, states, have, fertilizer, registration, programs, with, on, line, databases, listing, chemical, analyses, of, fertilizers, in, china, regulations, have, been, implemented, to, control, the, use, of, n, fertilizers, in, farming, in, 2008, chinese, governments, began, to, partially, withdraw, fertilizer, subsidies, including, subsidies, to, fertilizer, transportation, and, to, electricity, and, natural, gas, use, in, the, industry, in, consequence, the, price, of, fertilizer, has, gone, up, and, large, scale, farms, have, begun, to, use, less, fertilizer, if, large, scale, farms, keep, reducing, their, use, of, fertilizer, subsidies, they, have, no, choice, but, to, optimize, the, fertilizer, they, have, which, would, therefore, gain, an, increase, in, both, grain, yield, and, profit, in, march, 2022, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, announced, a, new, 250m, grant, to, promote, american, fertilizer, production, part, of, the, commodity, credit, corporation, the, grant, program, will, support, fertilizer, production, that, is, independent, of, dominant, fertilizer, suppliers, made, in, america, and, utilizing, innovative, production, techniques, to, jumpstart, future, competition, two, types, of, agricultural, management, practices, include, organic, agriculture, and, conventional, agriculture, the, former, encourages, soil, fertility, using, local, resources, to, maximize, efficiency, organic, agriculture, avoids, synthetic, agrochemicals, conventional, agriculture, uses, all, the, components, that, organic, agriculture, does, not, use
