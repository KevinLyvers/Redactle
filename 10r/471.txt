an, artificial, organ, is, a, human, made, organ, device, or, tissue, that, is, implanted, or, integrated, into, a, human, interfacing, with, living, tissue, to, replace, a, natural, organ, to, duplicate, or, augment, a, specific, function, or, functions, so, the, patient, may, return, to, a, normal, life, as, soon, as, possible, the, replaced, function, does, not, have, to, be, related, to, life, support, but, it, often, is, for, example, replacement, bones, and, joints, such, as, those, found, in, hip, replacements, could, also, be, considered, artificial, organs, implied, by, definition, is, that, the, device, must, not, be, continuously, tethered, to, a, stationary, power, supply, or, other, stationary, resources, such, as, filters, or, chemical, processing, units, periodic, rapid, recharging, of, batteries, refilling, of, chemicals, and, or, cleaning, replacing, of, filters, would, exclude, a, device, from, being, called, an, artificial, organ, thus, a, dialysis, machine, while, a, very, successful, and, critically, important, life, support, device, that, almost, completely, replaces, the, duties, of, a, kidney, is, not, an, artificial, organ, constructing, and, installing, artificial, organs, an, extremely, research, intensive, and, expensive, process, initially, may, entail, many, years, of, ongoing, maintenance, services, not, needed, by, a, natural, organ, the, use, of, any, artificial, organ, by, humans, is, almost, always, preceded, by, extensive, experiments, with, animals, initial, testing, in, humans, is, frequently, limited, to, those, either, already, facing, death, or, who, have, exhausted, every, other, treatment, possibility, artificial, arms, and, legs, or, prosthetics, are, intended, to, restore, a, degree, of, normal, function, to, amputees, mechanical, devices, that, allow, amputees, to, walk, again, or, continue, to, use, two, hands, have, probably, been, in, use, since, ancient, times, the, most, notable, one, being, the, simple, peg, leg, since, then, the, development, of, artificial, limbs, has, progressed, rapidly, new, plastics, and, other, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, have, allowed, artificial, limbs, to, become, stronger, and, lighter, limiting, the, amount, of, extra, energy, necessary, to, operate, the, limb, additional, materials, have, allowed, artificial, limbs, to, look, much, more, realistic, prostheses, can, roughly, be, categorized, as, upper, and, lower, extremity, and, can, take, many, shapes, and, sizes, new, advances, in, artificial, limbs, include, additional, levels, of, integration, with, the, human, body, electrodes, can, be, placed, into, nervous, tissue, and, the, body, can, be, trained, to, control, the, prosthesis, this, technology, has, been, used, in, both, animals, and, humans, the, prosthetic, can, be, controlled, by, the, brain, using, a, direct, implant, or, implant, into, various, muscles, the, two, main, methods, for, replacing, bladder, function, involve, either, redirecting, urine, flow, or, replacing, the, bladder, in, situ, standard, methods, for, replacing, the, bladder, involve, fashioning, a, bladder, like, pouch, from, intestinal, tissue, as, of, 2017, methods, to, grow, bladders, using, stem, cells, had, been, attempted, in, clinical, research, but, this, procedure, was, not, part, of, medicine, neural, prostheses, are, a, series, of, devices, that, can, substitute, a, motor, sensory, or, cognitive, modality, that, might, have, been, damaged, as, a, result, of, an, injury, or, a, disease, neurostimulators, including, deep, brain, stimulators, send, electrical, impulses, to, the, brain, in, order, to, treat, neurological, and, movement, disorders, including, parkinson, s, disease, epilepsy, treatment, resistant, depression, and, other, conditions, such, as, urinary, incontinence, rather, than, replacing, existing, neural, networks, to, restore, function, these, devices, often, serve, by, disrupting, the, output, of, existing, malfunctioning, nerve, centers, to, eliminate, symptoms, scientists, in, 2013, created, a, mini, brain, that, developed, key, neurological, components, until, the, early, gestational, stages, of, fetal, maturation, to, treat, erectile, dysfunction, both, corpora, cavernosa, can, be, irreversibly, surgically, replaced, with, manually, inflatable, penile, implants, this, is, a, drastic, therapeutic, surgery, meant, only, for, men, who, have, complete, impotence, who, have, resisted, all, other, treatment, approaches, an, implanted, pump, in, the, groin, or, scrotum, can, be, manipulated, by, hand, to, fill, these, artificial, cylinders, normally, sized, to, be, direct, replacements, for, the, natural, corpora, cavernosa, from, an, implanted, reservoir, in, order, to, achieve, an, erection, in, cases, when, a, person, is, profoundly, deaf, or, severely, hard, of, hearing, in, both, ears, a, cochlear, implant, may, be, surgically, implanted, cochlear, implants, bypass, most, of, the, peripheral, auditory, system, to, provide, a, sense, of, sound, via, a, microphone, and, some, electronics, that, reside, outside, the, skin, generally, behind, the, ear, the, external, components, transmit, a, signal, to, an, array, of, electrodes, placed, in, the, cochlea, which, in, turn, stimulates, the, cochlear, nerve, in, the, case, of, an, outer, ear, trauma, a, craniofacial, prosthesis, may, be, necessary, thomas, cervantes, and, his, colleagues, who, are, from, massachusetts, general, hospital, built, an, artificial, ear, from, sheep, cartilage, by, a, 3d, printer, with, a, lot, of, calculations, and, models, they, managed, to, build, an, ear, shaped, like, a, typical, human, one, modeled, by, a, plastic, surgeon, they, had, to, adjust, several, times, so, the, artificial, ear, can, have, curves, and, lines, just, like, a, human, ear, the, researchers, said, the, technology, is, now, under, development, for, clinical, trials, and, thus, we, have, scaled, up, and, redesigned, the, prominent, features, of, the, scaffold, to, match, the, size, of, an, adult, human, ear, and, to, preserve, the, aesthetic, appearance, after, implantation, their, artificial, ears, have, not, been, announced, as, successful, but, they, are, still, currently, developing, the, project, each, year, thousands, of, children, were, born, with, a, congenital, deformity, called, microtia, where, the, external, ear, does, not, fully, develop, this, could, be, a, major, step, forward, in, medical, and, surgical, microtia, treatment, the, most, successful, function, replacing, artificial, eye, so, far, is, actually, an, external, miniature, digital, camera, with, a, remote, unidirectional, electronic, interface, implanted, on, the, retina, optic, nerve, or, other, related, locations, inside, the, brain, the, present, state, of, the, art, yields, only, partial, functionality, such, as, recognizing, levels, of, brightness, swatches, of, color, and, or, basic, geometric, shapes, proving, the, concept, s, potential, various, researchers, have, demonstrated, that, the, retina, performs, strategic, image, preprocessing, for, the, brain, the, problem, of, creating, a, completely, functional, artificial, electronic, eye, is, even, more, complex, advances, towards, tackling, the, complexity, of, the, artificial, connection, to, the, retina, optic, nerve, or, related, brain, areas, combined, with, ongoing, advances, in, computer, science, are, expected, to, dramatically, improve, the, performance, of, this, technology, cardiovascular, related, artificial, organs, are, implanted, in, cases, where, the, heart, its, valves, or, another, part, of, the, circulatory, system, is, in, disorder, the, artificial, heart, is, typically, used, to, bridge, the, time, to, heart, transplantation, or, to, permanently, replace, the, heart, in, case, heart, transplantation, is, impossible, artificial, pacemakers, represent, another, cardiovascular, device, that, can, be, implanted, to, either, intermittently, augment, defibrillator, mode, continuously, augment, or, completely, bypass, the, natural, living, cardiac, pacemaker, as, needed, ventricular, assist, devices, are, another, alternative, acting, as, mechanical, circulatory, devices, that, partially, or, completely, replace, the, function, of, a, failing, heart, without, the, removal, of, the, heart, itself, besides, these, lab, grown, hearts, and, 3d, bioprinted, hearts, are, also, being, researched, currently, scientists, are, limited, in, their, ability, to, grow, and, print, hearts, due, to, difficulties, in, getting, blood, vessels, and, lab, made, tissues, to, function, cohesively, hepalife, is, developing, a, bioartificial, liver, device, intended, for, the, treatment, of, liver, failure, using, stem, cells, the, artificial, liver, is, designed, to, serve, as, a, supportive, device, either, allowing, the, liver, to, regenerate, upon, failure, or, to, bridge, the, patient, s, liver, functions, until, transplant, is, available, it, is, only, made, possible, by, the, fact, that, it, uses, real, liver, cells, hepatocytes, and, even, then, it, is, not, a, permanent, substitute, with, some, almost, fully, functional, artificial, lungs, promise, to, be, a, great, success, in, the, near, future, an, ann, arbor, company, mc3, is, currently, working, on, this, type, of, medical, device, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, ecmo, can, be, used, to, take, significant, load, off, of, the, native, lung, tissue, and, heart, in, ecmo, one, or, more, catheters, are, placed, into, the, patient, and, a, pump, is, used, to, flow, blood, over, hollow, membrane, fibers, which, exchange, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, with, the, blood, similar, to, ecmo, extracorporeal, co, 2, removal, ecco2r, has, a, similar, set, up, but, mainly, benefits, the, patient, through, carbon, dioxide, removal, rather, than, oxygenation, with, the, goal, of, allowing, the, lungs, to, relax, and, heal, the, ground, work, for, the, development, of, the, artificial, ovary, was, laid, in, the, early, 1990s, reproductive, age, patients, who, develop, cancer, often, receive, chemotherapy, or, radiation, therapy, which, damages, oocytes, and, leads, to, early, menopause, an, artificial, human, ovary, has, been, developed, at, brown, university, with, self, assembled, microtissues, created, using, novel, 3, d, petri, dish, technology, in, a, study, funded, and, conducted, by, the, nih, in, 2017, scientists, were, successful, in, printing, 3, d, ovaries, and, implanting, them, in, sterile, mice, in, the, future, scientists, hope, to, replicate, this, in, larger, animals, as, well, as, humans, the, artificial, ovary, will, be, used, for, the, purpose, of, in, vitro, maturation, of, immature, oocytes, and, the, development, of, a, system, to, study, the, effect, of, environmental, toxins, on, folliculogenesis, an, artificial, pancreas, is, used, to, substitute, endocrine, functionality, of, a, healthy, pancreas, for, diabetic, and, other, patients, who, require, it, it, can, be, used, to, improve, insulin, replacement, therapy, until, glycemic, control, is, practically, normal, as, evident, by, the, avoidance, of, the, complications, of, hyperglycemia, and, it, can, also, ease, the, burden, of, therapy, for, the, insulin, dependent, approaches, include, using, an, insulin, pump, under, closed, loop, control, developing, a, bio, artificial, pancreas, consisting, of, a, biocompatible, sheet, of, encapsulated, beta, cells, or, using, gene, therapy, artificial, red, blood, cells, rbc, have, already, been, in, projects, for, about, 60, years, but, they, started, getting, interest, when, the, hiv, contaminated, donor, blood, crisis, artificial, rbcs, will, be, dependent, 100, on, nanotechnology, a, successful, artificial, rbc, should, be, able, to, totally, replace, human, rbc, which, means, it, can, carry, on, all, the, functions, that, a, human, rbc, does, the, first, artificial, rbc, made, by, chang, and, poznanski, in, 1968, was, made, to, transport, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, also, fulfilled, antioxidant, functions, scientists, are, working, on, a, new, kind, of, artificial, rbc, which, is, one, fiftieth, the, size, of, a, human, rbc, they, are, made, from, purified, human, hemoglobin, proteins, that, have, been, coated, with, a, synthetic, polymer, thanks, to, the, special, materials, of, the, artificial, rbc, they, can, capture, oxygen, when, blood, ph, is, high, and, release, oxygen, when, blood, ph, is, low, the, polymer, coating, also, keeps, the, hemoglobin, from, reacting, with, nitric, oxide, in, the, bloodstream, thus, preventing, dangerous, constriction, of, the, blood, vessels, allan, doctor, md, stated, that, the, artificial, rbc, can, be, used, by, anyone, with, any, blood, type, because, the, coating, is, immune, silent, men, whom, have, sustained, testicular, abnormalities, through, birth, defects, or, injury, have, been, able, to, replace, the, damaged, testicle, with, a, testicular, prosthesis, although, the, prosthetic, does, not, restore, biological, reproductive, function, the, device, has, been, shown, to, improve, mental, health, for, these, patients, an, implantable, machine, that, performs, the, function, of, a, thymus, does, not, exist, however, researchers, have, been, able, to, grow, a, thymus, from, reprogrammed, fibroblasts, they, expressed, hope, that, the, approach, could, one, day, replace, or, supplement, neonatal, thymus, transplantation, as, of, 2017, researchers, at, ucla, developed, an, artificial, thymus, that, although, not, yet, implantable, is, capable, of, performing, all, functions, of, a, true, thymus, the, artificial, thymus, would, play, an, important, role, in, the, immune, system, and, it, would, use, blood, stem, cells, to, produce, more, t, cells, which, in, turn, help, the, body, fight, infections, it, would, ultimately, give, the, body, a, better, ability, to, fight, cancer, cells, as, people, age, if, their, thymus, stops, working, well, an, artificial, thymus, could, also, be, a, potentially, viable, option, the, idea, of, using, t, cells, to, fight, against, infections, has, been, around, for, a, time, but, until, recently, the, idea, of, using, a, t, cell, source, an, artificial, thymus, is, proposed, we, know, that, the, key, to, creating, a, consistent, and, safe, supply, of, cancer, fighting, t, cells, would, be, to, control, the, process, in, a, way, that, deactivates, all, t, cell, receptors, in, the, transplanted, cells, except, for, the, cancer, fighting, receptors, said, dr, gay, crooks, of, ucla, the, scientist, also, found, that, the, t, cells, produced, by, the, artificial, thymus, carried, a, diverse, range, of, t, cell, receptors, and, worked, similarly, to, the, t, cells, produced, by, a, normal, thymus, since, they, can, work, like, human, thymus, artificial, thymus, can, supply, a, consistent, amount, of, t, cells, to, the, body, for, the, patients, who, are, in, need, of, treatments, the, field, of, artificial, tracheas, went, through, a, period, of, high, interest, and, excitement, with, the, work, of, paolo, macchiarini, at, the, karolinska, institute, and, elsewhere, from, 2008, to, around, 2014, with, front, page, coverage, in, newspapers, and, on, television, concerns, were, raised, about, his, work, in, 2014, and, by, 2016, he, had, been, fired, and, high, level, management, at, karolinska, had, been, dismissed, including, people, involved, in, the, nobel, prize, as, of, 2017, engineering, a, trachea, a, hollow, tube, lined, with, cells, had, proved, more, challenging, than, originally, thought, challenges, include, the, difficult, clinical, situation, of, people, who, present, as, clinical, candidates, who, generally, have, been, through, multiple, procedures, already, creating, an, implant, that, can, become, fully, developed, and, integrate, with, host, while, withstanding, respiratory, forces, as, well, as, the, rotational, and, longitudinal, movement, the, trachea, undergoes, it, is, also, possible, to, construct, and, install, an, artificial, organ, to, give, its, possessor, abilities, that, are, not, naturally, occurring, research, is, proceeding, in, areas, of, vision, memory, and, information, processing, some, current, research, focuses, on, restoring, short, term, memory, in, accident, victims, and, long, term, memory, in, dementia, patients, one, area, of, success, was, achieved, when, kevin, warwick, carried, out, a, series, of, experiments, extending, his, nervous, system, over, the, internet, to, control, a, robotic, hand, and, the, first, direct, electronic, communication, between, the, nervous, systems, of, two, humans, this, might, also, include, the, existing, practice, of, implanting, subcutaneous, chips, for, identification, and, location, purposes, ex, rfid, tags, organ, chips, are, devices, containing, hollow, microvessels, filled, with, cells, simulating, tissue, and, or, organs, as, a, microfluidic, system, that, can, provide, key, chemical, and, electrical, signal, information, this, is, distinct, from, an, alternative, use, of, the, term, microchip, which, refers, to, small, electronic, chips, that, are, commonly, used, as, an, identifier, and, can, also, contain, a, transponder, this, information, can, create, various, applications, such, as, creating, human, in, vitro, models, for, both, healthy, and, diseased, organs, drug, advancements, in, toxicity, screening, as, well, as, replacing, animal, testing, using, 3d, cell, culture, techniques, enables, scientists, to, recreate, the, complex, extracellular, matrix, ecm, found, in, in, vivo, to, mimic, human, response, to, drugs, and, human, diseases, organs, on, chips, are, used, to, reduce, the, failure, rate, in, new, drug, development, microengineering, these, allows, for, a, microenvironment, to, be, modeled, as, an, organ
