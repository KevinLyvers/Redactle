a, furnace, american, english, referred, to, as, a, heater, or, boiler, in, british, english, is, an, appliance, used, to, generate, heat, for, all, or, part, of, a, building, furnaces, are, mostly, used, as, a, major, component, of, a, central, heating, system, furnaces, are, permanently, installed, to, provide, heat, to, an, interior, space, through, intermediary, fluid, movement, which, may, be, air, steam, or, hot, water, heating, appliances, that, use, steam, or, hot, water, as, the, fluid, are, normally, referred, to, as, a, residential, steam, boilers, or, residential, hot, water, boilers, the, most, common, fuel, source, for, modern, furnaces, in, north, america, and, much, of, europe, is, natural, gas, other, common, fuel, sources, include, lpg, liquefied, petroleum, gas, fuel, oil, wood, and, in, rare, cases, coal, in, some, areas, electrical, resistance, heating, is, used, especially, where, the, cost, of, electricity, is, low, or, the, primary, purpose, is, for, air, conditioning, modern, high, efficiency, furnaces, can, be, up, to, 98, efficient, and, operate, without, a, chimney, with, a, typical, gas, furnace, being, about, 80, efficient, waste, gas, and, heat, are, mechanically, ventilated, through, either, metal, flue, pipes, or, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, pipes, that, can, be, vented, through, the, side, or, roof, of, the, structure, fuel, efficiency, in, a, gas, furnace, is, measured, in, afue, annual, fuel, utilization, efficiency, the, name, derives, from, latin, word, fornax, which, means, oven, furnaces, can, be, classified, into, four, general, categories, based, on, efficiency, and, design, natural, draft, forced, air, forced, draft, and, condensing, the, first, category, of, furnaces, is, natural, draft, atmospheric, burner, furnaces, these, furnaces, consisted, of, cast, iron, or, riveted, steel, heat, exchangers, built, within, an, outer, shell, of, brick, masonry, or, steel, the, heat, exchangers, were, vented, through, brick, or, masonry, chimneys, air, circulation, depended, on, large, upwardly, pitched, pipes, constructed, of, wood, or, metal, the, pipes, would, channel, the, warm, air, into, floor, or, wall, vents, inside, the, home, this, method, of, heating, worked, because, warm, air, rises, the, system, was, simple, had, few, controls, a, single, automatic, gas, valve, and, no, blower, these, furnaces, could, be, made, to, work, with, any, fuel, simply, by, adapting, the, burner, area, they, have, been, operated, with, wood, coke, coal, trash, paper, natural, gas, fuel, oil, as, well, as, whale, oil, for, a, brief, period, at, the, turn, of, the, century, furnaces, that, used, solid, fuels, required, daily, maintenance, to, remove, ash, and, clinkers, that, accumulated, in, the, bottom, of, the, burner, area, in, later, years, these, furnaces, were, adapted, with, electric, blowers, to, aid, air, distribution, and, speed, moving, heat, into, the, home, gas, and, oil, fired, systems, were, usually, controlled, by, a, thermostat, inside, the, home, while, most, wood, and, coal, fired, furnaces, had, no, electrical, connection, and, were, controlled, by, the, amount, of, fuel, in, the, burner, and, position, of, the, fresh, air, damper, on, the, burner, access, door, the, second, category, of, furnace, is, the, forced, air, having, atmospheric, burner, style, with, a, cast, iron, or, sectional, steel, heat, exchanger, through, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, this, style, of, furnace, was, used, to, replace, the, big, natural, draft, systems, and, was, sometimes, installed, on, the, existing, gravity, duct, work, the, heated, air, was, moved, by, blowers, which, were, belted, driven, and, designed, for, a, wide, range, of, speeds, these, furnaces, were, still, big, and, bulky, compared, to, modern, furnaces, and, had, heavy, steel, exteriors, with, bolt, on, removable, panels, energy, efficiency, would, range, anywhere, from, just, over, 50, to, upward, of, 65, afue, this, style, furnace, still, used, large, masonry, or, brick, chimneys, for, flues, and, was, eventually, designed, to, accommodate, air, conditioning, systems, the, third, category, of, furnace, is, the, forced, draft, mid, efficiency, furnace, with, a, steel, heat, exchanger, and, multi, speed, blower, these, furnaces, were, physically, much, more, compact, than, the, previous, styles, they, were, equipped, with, combustion, air, blowers, that, would, pull, air, through, the, heat, exchanger, which, greatly, increased, fuel, efficiency, while, allowing, the, heat, exchangers, to, become, smaller, these, furnaces, may, have, multi, speed, blowers, and, were, designed, to, work, with, central, air, conditioning, systems, the, fourth, category, of, furnace, is, the, high, efficiency, condensing, gas, furnace, high, efficiency, condensing, gas, furnaces, typically, achieve, between, 90, and, 98, afue, a, condensing, gas, furnace, includes, a, sealed, combustion, area, combustion, draft, inducer, and, a, secondary, heat, exchanger, the, primary, gain, in, efficiency, for, a, condensing, gas, furnace, as, compared, to, a, mid, efficiency, forced, air, or, forced, draft, furnace, is, the, capture, of, latent, heat, from, the, exhaust, gases, in, the, secondary, heat, exchanger, the, secondary, heat, exchanger, removes, most, of, the, heat, energy, from, the, exhaust, gas, actually, condensing, water, vapour, and, other, chemicals, which, form, a, mild, acid, as, it, operates, the, vent, pipes, also, known, as, the, exhaust, system, are, often, installed, using, pvc, pipe, instead, of, metal, venting, pipe, to, prevent, corrosion, but, this, will, vary, based, on, geographical, location, of, the, installation, and, local, regulations, the, draft, inducer, allows, for, the, exhaust, piping, to, be, routed, vertically, or, horizontally, as, it, exits, the, structure, a, typical, installation, arrangement, for, high, efficiency, furnaces, includes, a, fresh, air, intake, supply, pipe, that, brings, fresh, air, from, outside, the, home, to, the, furnace, combustion, unit, normally, the, fresh, combustion, air, is, routed, alongside, the, exhaust, pvc, during, installation, and, the, pipes, exit, through, a, sidewall, of, the, home, in, the, same, location, high, efficiency, furnaces, typically, deliver, a, 25, to, 35, fuel, savings, over, a, 60, afue, furnace, a, single, stage, furnace, has, only, one, stage, of, operation, it, is, either, on, or, off, this, means, that, it, is, relatively, noisy, always, running, at, the, highest, speed, and, always, pumping, out, the, hottest, air, at, the, highest, velocity, one, of, the, benefits, to, a, single, stage, furnace, is, typically, the, cost, for, installation, single, stage, furnaces, are, relatively, inexpensive, since, the, technology, is, rather, simple, however, the, simplicity, of, single, stage, gas, furnaces, come, at, the, cost, of, blower, motor, noise, and, mechanical, inefficiency, the, blower, motors, on, these, single, stage, furnaces, consume, more, energy, overall, because, regardless, of, the, heating, requirements, of, the, space, the, fan, and, blower, motors, operate, at, a, fixed, speed, due, to, its, one, speed, operation, a, single, stage, furnace, is, also, called, a, single, speed, furnace, a, two, stage, furnace, has, to, do, two, stage, full, speed, and, half, or, reduced, speed, depending, on, the, demanded, heat, they, can, run, at, a, lower, speed, most, of, the, time, they, can, be, quieter, move, the, air, at, less, velocity, and, will, better, keep, the, desired, temperature, in, the, house, a, modulating, furnace, can, modulate, the, heat, output, and, air, velocity, nearly, continuously, depending, on, the, demanded, heat, and, outside, temperature, this, means, that, it, only, works, as, much, as, necessary, and, therefore, saves, energy, the, furnace, transfers, heat, to, the, living, space, of, the, building, through, an, intermediary, distribution, system, if, the, distribution, is, through, hot, water, or, other, fluid, or, through, steam, then, the, furnace, is, more, commonly, called, a, boiler, one, advantage, of, a, boiler, is, that, the, furnace, can, provide, hot, water, for, bathing, and, washing, dishes, rather, than, requiring, a, separate, water, heater, one, disadvantage, to, this, type, of, application, is, when, the, boiler, breaks, down, neither, heating, nor, domestic, hot, water, are, available, air, convection, heating, systems, have, been, in, use, for, over, a, century, older, systems, rely, on, a, passive, air, circulation, system, where, the, greater, density, of, cooler, air, causes, it, to, sink, into, the, furnace, area, below, through, air, return, registers, in, the, floor, and, the, lesser, density, of, warmed, air, causes, it, to, rise, in, the, ductwork, the, two, forces, acting, together, to, drive, air, circulation, in, a, system, termed, gravity, fed, the, layout, of, these, octopus, furnaces, and, their, duct, systems, is, optimized, with, various, diameters, of, large, dampered, ducts, by, comparison, most, modern, warm, air, furnaces, typically, use, a, fan, to, circulate, air, to, the, rooms, of, house, and, pull, cooler, air, back, to, the, furnace, for, reheating, this, is, called, forced, air, heat, because, the, fan, easily, overcomes, the, resistance, of, the, ductwork, the, arrangement, of, ducts, can, be, far, more, flexible, than, the, octopus, of, old, in, american, practice, separate, ducts, collect, cool, air, to, be, returned, to, the, furnace, at, the, furnace, cool, air, passes, into, the, furnace, usually, through, an, air, filter, through, the, blower, then, through, the, heat, exchanger, of, the, furnace, whence, it, is, blown, throughout, the, building, one, major, advantage, of, this, type, of, system, is, that, it, also, enables, easy, installation, of, central, air, conditioning, simply, by, adding, a, cooling, coil, at, the, outlet, of, the, furnace, air, is, circulated, through, ductwork, which, may, be, made, of, sheet, metal, or, plastic, flex, duct, and, is, insulated, or, uninsulated, unless, the, ducts, and, plenum, have, been, sealed, using, mastic, or, foil, duct, tape, the, ductwork, is, likely, to, have, a, high, leakage, of, conditioned, air, possibly, into, unconditioned, spaces, another, cause, of, wasted, energy, is, the, installation, of, ductwork, in, unheated, areas, such, as, attics, and, crawl, spaces, or, ductwork, of, air, conditioning, systems, in, attics, in, warm,
