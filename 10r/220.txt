in, the, field, of, food, processing, pasteurization, also, pasteurisation, is, a, process, of, food, preservation, in, which, packaged, and, unpacked, foods, e, g, milk, and, fruit, juices, are, treated, with, mild, heat, usually, to, less, than, 100, c, 212, f, to, eliminate, pathogens, and, extend, shelf, life, pasteurization, either, destroys, or, deactivates, microorganisms, and, enzymes, that, contribute, to, food, spoilage, or, the, risk, of, disease, including, vegetative, bacteria, but, most, bacterial, spores, survive, the, process, the, process, of, pasteurization, is, named, after, the, french, microbiologist, louis, pasteur, whose, research, in, the, 1860s, demonstrated, that, thermal, processing, would, deactivate, unwanted, microorganisms, in, wine, spoilage, enzymes, are, also, inactivated, during, pasteurization, today, pasteurization, is, used, widely, in, the, dairy, industry, and, other, food, processing, industries, to, achieve, food, preservation, and, food, safety, by, the, year, 1999, most, liquid, products, were, heat, treated, in, a, continuous, system, where, heat, can, be, applied, using, a, heat, exchanger, or, the, direct, or, indirect, use, of, hot, water, and, steam, due, to, the, mild, heat, there, are, minor, changes, to, the, nutritional, quality, and, sensory, characteristics, of, the, treated, foods, pascalization, or, high, pressure, processing, hpp, and, pulsed, electric, field, pef, are, non, thermal, processes, that, are, also, used, to, pasteurize, foods, the, process, of, heating, wine, for, preservation, purposes, has, been, known, in, china, since, ad, 1117, and, was, documented, in, japan, in, the, diary, tamonin, nikki, written, by, a, series, of, monks, between, 1478, and, 1618, much, later, in, 1768, research, performed, by, italian, priest, and, scientist, lazzaro, spallanzani, proved, a, product, could, be, made, sterile, after, thermal, processing, spallanzani, boiled, meat, broth, for, one, hour, sealed, the, container, immediately, after, boiling, and, noticed, that, the, broth, did, not, spoil, and, was, free, from, microorganisms, in, 1795, a, parisian, chef, and, confectioner, named, nicolas, appert, began, experimenting, with, ways, to, preserve, foodstuffs, succeeding, with, soups, vegetables, juices, dairy, products, jellies, jams, and, syrups, he, placed, the, food, in, glass, jars, sealed, them, with, cork, and, sealing, wax, and, placed, them, in, boiling, water, in, that, same, year, the, french, military, offered, a, cash, prize, of, 12, 000, francs, for, a, new, method, to, preserve, food, after, some, 14, or, 15, years, of, experimenting, appert, submitted, his, invention, and, won, the, prize, in, january, 1810, later, that, year, appert, published, l, art, de, conserver, les, substances, animales, et, v, g, tales, the, art, of, preserving, animal, and, vegetable, substances, this, was, the, first, cookbook, of, its, kind, on, modern, food, preservation, methods, la, maison, appert, english, the, house, of, appert, in, the, town, of, massy, near, paris, became, the, first, food, bottling, factory, in, the, world, preserving, a, variety, of, foods, in, sealed, bottles, appert, s, method, was, to, fill, thick, large, mouthed, glass, bottles, with, produce, of, every, description, ranging, from, beef, and, fowl, to, eggs, milk, and, prepared, dishes, he, left, air, space, at, the, top, of, the, bottle, and, the, cork, would, then, be, sealed, firmly, in, the, jar, by, using, a, vise, the, bottle, was, then, wrapped, in, canvas, to, protect, it, while, it, was, dunked, into, boiling, water, and, then, boiled, for, as, much, time, as, appert, deemed, appropriate, for, cooking, the, contents, thoroughly, appert, patented, his, method, sometimes, called, appertisation, in, his, honor, appert, s, method, was, so, simple, and, workable, that, it, quickly, became, widespread, in, 1810, british, inventor, and, merchant, peter, durand, also, of, french, origin, patented, his, own, method, but, this, time, in, a, tin, can, so, creating, the, modern, day, process, of, canning, foods, in, 1812, englishmen, bryan, donkin, and, john, hall, purchased, both, patents, and, began, producing, preserves, just, a, decade, later, appert, s, method, of, canning, had, made, its, way, to, america, tin, can, production, was, not, common, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, partly, because, a, hammer, and, chisel, were, needed, to, open, cans, until, the, invention, of, a, can, opener, by, robert, yeates, in, 1855, a, less, aggressive, method, was, developed, by, french, chemist, louis, pasteur, during, an, 1864, summer, holiday, in, arbois, to, remedy, the, frequent, acidity, of, the, local, aged, wines, he, found, out, experimentally, that, it, is, sufficient, to, heat, a, young, wine, to, only, about, 50, 60, c, 122, 140, f, for, a, short, time, to, kill, the, microbes, and, that, the, wine, could, subsequently, be, aged, without, sacrificing, the, final, quality, in, honor, of, pasteur, this, process, is, known, as, pasteurization, pasteurization, was, originally, used, as, a, way, of, preventing, wine, and, beer, from, souring, and, it, would, be, many, years, before, milk, was, pasteurized, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1870s, before, milk, was, regulated, it, was, common, for, milk, to, contain, substances, intended, to, mask, spoilage, milk, is, an, excellent, medium, for, microbial, growth, and, when, it, is, stored, at, ambient, temperature, bacteria, and, other, pathogens, soon, proliferate, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, says, improperly, handled, raw, milk, is, responsible, for, nearly, three, times, more, hospitalizations, than, any, other, food, borne, disease, source, making, it, one, of, the, world, s, most, dangerous, food, products, diseases, prevented, by, pasteurization, can, include, tuberculosis, brucellosis, diphtheria, scarlet, fever, and, q, fever, it, also, kills, the, harmful, bacteria, salmonella, listeria, yersinia, campylobacter, staphylococcus, aureus, and, escherichia, coli, o157, h7, among, others, prior, to, industrialization, dairy, cows, were, kept, in, urban, areas, to, limit, the, time, between, milk, production, and, consumption, hence, the, risk, of, disease, transmission, via, raw, milk, was, reduced, as, urban, densities, increased, and, supply, chains, lengthened, to, the, distance, from, country, to, city, raw, milk, often, days, old, became, recognized, as, a, source, of, disease, for, example, between, 1912, and, 1937, some, 65, 000, people, died, of, tuberculosis, contracted, from, consuming, milk, in, england, and, wales, alone, because, tuberculosis, has, a, long, incubation, period, in, humans, it, was, difficult, to, link, unpasteurized, milk, consumption, with, the, disease, in, 1892, chemist, ernst, lederle, experimentally, inoculated, milk, from, tuberculosis, diseased, cows, into, guinea, pigs, which, caused, them, to, develop, the, disease, in, 1910, lederle, then, in, the, role, of, commissioner, of, health, introduced, mandatory, pasteurization, of, milk, in, new, york, city, developed, countries, adopted, milk, pasteurization, to, prevent, such, disease, and, loss, of, life, and, as, a, result, milk, is, now, considered, a, safer, food, a, traditional, form, of, pasteurization, by, scalding, and, straining, of, cream, to, increase, the, keeping, qualities, of, butter, was, practiced, in, great, britain, in, the, 18th, century, and, was, introduced, to, boston, in, the, british, colonies, by, 1773, although, it, was, not, widely, practiced, in, the, united, states, for, the, next, 20, years, pasteurization, of, milk, was, suggested, by, franz, von, soxhlet, in, 1886, in, the, early, 20th, century, milton, joseph, rosenau, established, the, standards, i, e, low, temperature, slow, heating, at, 60, c, 140, f, for, 20, minutes, for, the, pasteurization, of, milk, while, at, the, united, states, marine, hospital, service, notably, in, his, publication, of, the, milk, question, 1912, states, in, the, u, s, soon, began, enacting, mandatory, dairy, pasteurization, laws, with, the, first, in, 1947, and, in, 1973, the, u, s, federal, government, required, pasteurization, of, milk, used, in, any, interstate, commerce, the, shelf, life, of, refrigerated, pasteurized, milk, is, greater, than, that, of, raw, milk, for, example, high, temperature, short, time, htst, pasteurized, milk, typically, has, a, refrigerated, shelf, life, of, two, to, three, weeks, whereas, ultra, pasteurized, milk, can, last, much, longer, sometimes, two, to, three, months, when, ultra, heat, treatment, uht, is, combined, with, sterile, handling, and, container, technology, such, as, aseptic, packaging, it, can, even, be, stored, non, refrigerated, for, up, to, 9, months, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, between, 1998, and, 2011, 79, of, dairy, related, disease, outbreaks, in, the, united, states, were, due, to, raw, milk, or, cheese, products, they, report, 148, outbreaks, and, 2, 384, illnesses, with, 284, requiring, hospitalization, as, well, as, two, deaths, due, to, raw, milk, or, cheese, products, during, the, same, time, period, medical, equipment, notably, respiratory, and, anesthesia, equipment, is, often, disinfected, using, hot, water, as, an, alternative, to, chemical, disinfection, the, temperature, is, raised, to, 70, c, 158, f, for, 30, minutes, pasteurization, is, a, mild, heat, treatment, of, liquid, foods, both, packaged, and, unpackaged, where, products, are, typically, heated, to, below, 100, c, the, heat, treatment, and, cooling, process, are, designed, to, inhibit, a, phase, change, of, the, product, the, acidity, of, the, food, determines, the, parameters, time, and, temperature, of, the, heat, treatment, as, well, as, the, duration, of, shelf, life, parameters, also, take, into, account, nutritional, and, sensory, qualities, that, are, sensitive, to, heat, in, acidic, foods, ph, 4, 6, such, as, fruit, juice, and, beer, the, heat, treatments, are, designed, to, inactivate, enzymes, pectin, methylesterase, and, polygalacturonase, in, fruit, juices, and, destroy, spoilage, microbes, yeast, and, lactobacillus, due, to, the, low, ph, of, acidic, foods, pathogens, are, unable, to, grow, the, shelf, life, is, thereby, extended, several, weeks, in, less, acidic, foods, ph, 4, 6, such, as, milk, and, liquid, eggs, the, heat, treatments, are, designed, to, destroy, pathogens, and, spoilage, organisms, yeast, and, molds, not, all, spoilage, organisms, are, destroyed, under, pasteurization, parameters, so, subsequent, refrigeration, is, necessary, high, temperature, short, time, htst, pasteurization, such, as, that, used, for, milk, 71, 5, c, 160, 7, f, for, 15, seconds, ensures, safety, of, milk, and, provides, a, refrigerated, shelf, life, of, approximately, two, weeks, in, ultra, high, temperature, uht, pasteurization, milk, is, pasteurized, at, 135, c, 275, f, for, 1, 2, seconds, which, provides, the, same, level, of, safety, but, along, with, the, packaging, extends, shelf, life, to, three, months, under, refrigeration, food, can, be, pasteurized, either, before, or, after, being, packaged, into, containers, pasteurization, of, food, in, containers, generally, uses, either, steam, or, hot, water, when, food, is, packaged, in, glass, hot, water, is, used, to, avoid, cracking, the, glass, from, thermal, shock, when, plastic, or, metal, packaging, is, used, the, risk, of, thermal, shock, is, low, so, steam, or, hot, water, is, used, most, liquid, foods, are, pasteurized, by, using, a, continuous, process, that, passes, the, food, through, a, heating, zone, a, hold, tube, to, keep, it, at, the, pasteurization, temperature, for, the, desired, time, and, a, cooling, zone, after, which, the, product, is, filled, into, the, package, plate, heat, exchangers, are, often, used, for, low, viscosity, products, such, as, animal, milks, nut, milks, and, juices, a, plate, heat, exchanger, is, composed, of, many, thin, vertical, stainless, steel, plates, that, separate, the, liquid, from, the, heating, or, cooling, medium, shell, and, tube, heat, exchangers, are, often, used, for, the, pasteurization, of, foods, that, are, non, newtonian, fluids, such, as, dairy, products, tomato, ketchup, and, baby, foods, a, tube, heat, exchanger, is, made, up, of, concentric, stainless, steel, tubes, food, passes, through, the, inner, tube, or, tubes, while, the, heating, cooling, medium, is, circulated, through, the, outer, tube, scraped, surface, heat, exchangers, are, a, type, of, shell, and, tube, which, contain, an, inner, rotating, shaft, having, spring, loaded, blades, that, serve, to, scrape, away, any, highly, viscous, material, that, accumulates, on, the, wall, of, the, tube, the, benefits, of, using, a, heat, exchanger, to, pasteurize, foods, before, packaging, versus, pasteurizing, foods, in, containers, are, after, being, heated, in, a, heat, exchanger, the, product, flows, through, a, hold, tube, for, a, set, period, of, time, to, achieve, the, required, treatment, if, pasteurization, temperature, or, time, is, not, achieved, a, flow, diversion, valve, is, used, to, divert, under, processed, product, back, to, the, raw, product, tank, if, the, product, is, adequately, processed, it, is, cooled, in, a, heat, exchanger, then, filled, direct, microbiological, techniques, are, the, ultimate, measurement, of, pathogen, contamination, but, these, are, costly, and, time, consuming, which, means, that, products, have, a, reduced, shelf, life, by, the, time, pasteurization, is, verified, as, a, result, of, the, unsuitability, of, microbiological, techniques, milk, pasteurization, efficacy, is, typically, monitored, by, checking, for, the, presence, of, alkaline, phosphatase, which, is, denatured, by, pasteurization, destruction, of, alkaline, phosphatase, ensures, the, destruction, of, common, milk, pathogens, therefore, the, presence, of, alkaline, phosphatase, is, an, ideal, indicator, of, pasteurization, efficacy, for, liquid, eggs, the, effectiveness, of, the, heat, treatment, is, measured, by, the, residual, activity, of, amylase, during, the, early, 20th, century, there, was, no, robust, knowledge, of, what, time, and, temperature, combinations, would, inactivate, pathogenic, bacteria, in, milk, and, so, a, number, of, different, pasteurization, standards, were, in, use, by, 1943, both, htst, pasteurization, conditions, of, 72, c, 162, f, for, 15, seconds, as, well, as, batch, pasteurization, conditions, of, 63, c, 145, f, for, 30, minutes, were, confirmed, by, studies, of, the, complete, thermal, death, as, best, as, could, be, measured, at, that, time, for, a, range, of, pathogenic, bacteria, in, milk, complete, inactivation, of, coxiella, burnetii, which, was, thought, at, the, time, to, cause, q, fever, by, oral, ingestion, of, infected, milk, as, well, as, of, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, which, causes, tuberculosis, were, later, demonstrated, for, all, practical, purposes, these, conditions, were, adequate, for, destroying, almost, all, yeasts, molds, and, common, spoilage, bacteria, and, also, for, ensuring, adequate, destruction, of, common, pathogenic, heat, resistant, organisms, however, the, microbiological, techniques, used, until, the, 1960s, did, not, allow, for, the, actual, reduction, of, bacteria, to, be, enumerated, demonstration, of, the, extent, of, inactivation, of, pathogenic, bacteria, by, milk, pasteurization, came, from, a, study, of, surviving, bacteria, in, milk, that, was, heat, treated, after, being, deliberately, spiked, with, high, levels, of, the, most, heat, resistant, strains, of, the, most, significant, milk, borne, pathogens, the, mean, log, 10, reductions, and, temperatures, of, inactivation, of, the, major, milk, borne, pathogens, during, a, 15, second, treatment, are, a, log, 10, reduction, between, 6, and, 7, means, that, 1, bacterium, out, of, 1, million, 10, 6, to, 10, million, 10, 7, bacteria, survive, the, treatment, the, codex, alimentarius, code, of, hygienic, practice, for, milk, notes, that, milk, pasteurization, is, designed, to, achieve, at, least, a, 5, log, 10, reduction, of, coxiella, burnetii, the, code, also, notes, that, the, minimum, pasteurization, conditions, are, those, having, bactericidal, effects, equivalent, to, heating, every, particle, of, the, milk, to, 72, c, for, 15, seconds, continuous, flow, pasteurization, or, 63, c, for, 30, minutes, batch, pasteurization, and, that, to, ensure, that, each, particle, is, sufficiently, heated, the, milk, flow, in, heat, exchangers, should, be, turbulent, i, e, the, reynolds, number, should, be, sufficiently, high, the, point, about, turbulent, flow, is, important, because, simplistic, laboratory, studies, of, heat, inactivation, that, use, test, tubes, without, flow, will, have, less, bacterial, inactivation, than, larger, scale, experiments, that, seek, to, replicate, conditions, of, commercial, pasteurization, as, a, precaution, modern, htst, pasteurization, processes, must, be, designed, with, flow, rate, restriction, as, well, as, divert, valves, which, ensure, that, the, milk, is, heated, evenly, and, that, no, part, of, the, milk, is, subject, to, a, shorter, time, or, a, lower, temperature, it, is, common, for, the, temperatures, to, exceed, 72, c, by, 1, 5, c, or, 2, c, pasteurization, is, not, sterilization, and, does, not, kill, spores, double, pasteurization, which, involves, a, secondary, heating, process, can, extend, shelf, life, by, killing, spores, that, have, germinated, the, acceptance, of, double, pasteurization, varies, by, jurisdiction, in, places, where, it, is, allowed, milk, is, initially, pasteurized, when, it, is, collected, from, the, farm, so, it, does, not, spoil, before, processing, many, countries, prohibit, the, labelling, of, such, milk, as, pasteurized, but, allow, it, to, be, marked, thermized, which, refers, to, a, lower, temperature, process, because, of, its, mild, heat, treatment, pasteurization, increases, the, shelf, life, by, a, few, days, or, weeks, however, this, mild, heat, also, means, there, are, only, minor, changes, to, heat, labile, vitamins, in, the, foods, according, to, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, it, was, found, that, pasteurization, appeared, to, reduce, concentrations, of, vitamins, b12, and, e, but, it, also, increased, concentrations, of, vitamin, a, however, in, the, review, there, was, only, limited, research, regarding, how, much, pasteurization, affects, a, b12, and, e, levels, milk, is, not, considered, an, important, source, of, vitamins, b12, or, e, in, the, north, american, diet, so, the, effects, of, pasteurization, on, the, adult, daily, intake, of, these, vitamins, is, negligible, however, milk, is, considered, an, important, source, of, vitamin, a, and, because, pasteurization, appears, to, increase, vitamin, a, concentrations, in, milk, the, effect, of, milk, heat, treatment, on, this, vitamin, is, a, not, a, major, public, health, concern, results, of, meta, analyses, reveal, that, pasteurization, of, milk, leads, to, a, significant, decrease, in, vitamin, c, and, folate, but, milk, is, also, not, an, important, source, of, these, vitamins, a, significant, decrease, in, vitamin, b2, concentrations, was, found, after, pasteurization, vitamin, b2, is, typically, found, in, bovine, milk, at, concentrations, of, 1, 83, mg, liter, because, the, recommended, daily, intake, for, adults, is, 1, 1, mg, day, milk, consumption, greatly, contributes, to, the, recommended, daily, intake, of, this, vitamin, with, the, exception, of, b2, pasteurization, does, not, appear, to, be, a, concern, in, diminishing, the, nutritive, value, of, milk, because, milk, is, often, not, a, primary, source, of, these, studied, vitamins, in, the, north, american, diet, pasteurization, also, has, a, small, but, measurable, effect, on, the, sensory, attributes, of, the, foods, that, are, processed, in, fruit, juices, pasteurization, may, result, in, loss, of, volatile, aroma, compounds, fruit, juice, products, undergo, a, deaeration, process, prior, to, pasteurization, that, may, be, responsible, for, this, loss, deaeration, also, minimizes, the, loss, of, nutrients, like, vitamin, c, and, carotene, to, prevent, the, decrease, in, quality, resulting, from, the, loss, in, volatile, compounds, volatile, recovery, though, costly, can, be, utilized, to, produce, higher, quality, juice, products, in, regard, to, color, the, pasteurization, process, does, not, have, much, effect, on, pigments, such, as, chlorophylls, anthocyanins, and, carotenoids, in, plants, and, animal, tissues, in, fruit, juices, polyphenol, oxidase, ppo, is, the, main, enzyme, responsible, for, causing, browning, and, color, changes, however, this, enzyme, is, deactivated, in, the, deaeration, step, prior, to, pasteurization, with, the, removal, of, oxygen, in, milk, the, color, difference, between, pasteurized, and, raw, milk, is, related, to, the, homogenization, step, that, takes, place, prior, to, pasteurization, before, pasteurization, milk, is, homogenized, to, emulsify, its, fat, and, water, soluble, components, which, results, in, the, pasteurized, milk, having, a, whiter, appearance, compared, to, raw, milk, for, vegetable, products, color, degradation, is, dependent, on, the, temperature, conditions, and, the, duration, of, heating, pasteurization, may, result, in, some, textural, loss, as, a, result, of, enzymatic, and, non, enzymatic, transformations, in, the, structure, of, pectin, if, the, processing, temperatures, are, too, high, as, a, result, however, with, mild, heat, treatment, pasteurization, tissue, softening, in, the, vegetables, that, causes, textural, loss, is, not, of, concern, as, long, as, the, temperature, does, not, get, above, 80, c, 176, f, pasteurizing, in, the, broad, sense, refers, to, any, method, that, reduces, microbes, by, an, amount, log, reduction, equivalent, to, pasteur, s, process, novel, processes, thermal, and, non, thermal, have, been, developed, to, pasteurize, foods, as, a, way, of, reducing, the, effects, on, nutritional, and, sensory, characteristics, of, foods, and, preventing, degradation, of, heat, labile, nutrients, pascalization, or, high, pressure, processing, hpp, pulsed, electric, field, pef, ionising, radiation, high, pressure, homogenisation, uv, decontamination, pulsed, high, intensity, light, high, intensity, laser, pulsed, white, light, high, power, ultrasound, oscillating, magnetic, fields, high, voltage, arc, discharge, and, streamer, plasma, are, examples, of, these, non, thermal, pasteurization, methods, that, are, currently, commercially, utilized, microwave, volumetric, heating, mvh, is, the, newest, available, pasteurization, technology, it, uses, microwaves, to, heat, liquids, suspensions, or, semi, solids, in, a, continuous, flow, because, mvh, delivers, energy, evenly, and, deeply, into, the, whole, body, of, a, flowing, product, it, allows, for, gentler, and, shorter, heating, so, that, almost, all, heat, sensitive, substances, in, the, milk, are, preserved
