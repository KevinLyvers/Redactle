electricity, generation, is, the, process, of, generating, electric, power, from, sources, of, primary, energy, for, utilities, in, the, electric, power, industry, it, is, the, stage, prior, to, its, delivery, transmission, distribution, etc, to, end, users, or, its, storage, using, for, example, the, pumped, storage, method, consumable, electricity, is, not, freely, available, in, nature, so, it, must, be, produced, transforming, other, forms, of, energy, to, electricity, production, is, carried, out, in, power, stations, also, called, power, plants, electricity, is, most, often, generated, at, a, power, plant, by, electromechanical, generators, primarily, driven, by, heat, engines, fueled, by, combustion, or, nuclear, fission, but, also, by, other, means, such, as, the, kinetic, energy, of, flowing, water, and, wind, other, energy, sources, include, solar, photovoltaics, and, geothermal, power, there, are, exotic, and, speculative, methods, to, recover, energy, such, as, proposed, fusion, reactor, designs, which, aim, to, directly, extract, energy, from, intense, magnetic, fields, generated, by, fast, moving, charged, particles, generated, by, the, fusion, reaction, see, magnetohydrodynamics, phasing, out, coal, fired, power, stations, and, eventually, gas, fired, power, stations, or, if, practical, capturing, their, greenhouse, gas, emissions, is, an, important, part, of, the, energy, transformation, required, to, limit, climate, change, vastly, more, solar, power, and, wind, power, is, forecast, to, be, required, with, electricity, demand, increasing, strongly, with, further, electrification, of, transport, homes, and, industry, however, in, 2023, it, was, reported, that, the, global, electricity, supply, was, approaching, peak, co2, emissions, thanks, to, the, growth, of, solar, and, wind, power, the, fundamental, principles, of, electricity, generation, were, discovered, in, the, 1820s, and, early, 1830s, by, british, scientist, michael, faraday, his, method, still, used, today, is, for, electricity, to, be, generated, by, the, movement, of, a, loop, of, wire, or, faraday, disc, between, the, poles, of, a, magnet, central, power, stations, became, economically, practical, with, the, development, of, alternating, current, ac, power, transmission, using, power, transformers, to, transmit, power, at, high, voltage, and, with, low, loss, commercial, electricity, production, started, with, the, coupling, of, the, dynamo, to, the, hydraulic, turbine, the, mechanical, production, of, electric, power, began, the, second, industrial, revolution, and, made, possible, several, inventions, using, electricity, with, the, major, contributors, being, thomas, alva, edison, and, nikola, tesla, previously, the, only, way, to, produce, electricity, was, by, chemical, reactions, or, using, battery, cells, and, the, only, practical, use, of, electricity, was, for, the, telegraph, electricity, generation, at, central, power, stations, started, in, 1882, when, a, steam, engine, driving, a, dynamo, at, pearl, street, station, produced, a, dc, current, that, powered, public, lighting, on, pearl, street, new, york, the, new, technology, was, quickly, adopted, by, many, cities, around, the, world, which, adapted, their, gas, fueled, street, lights, to, electric, power, soon, after, electric, lights, would, be, used, in, public, buildings, in, businesses, and, to, power, public, transport, such, as, trams, and, trains, the, first, power, plants, used, water, power, or, coal, today, a, variety, of, energy, sources, are, used, such, as, coal, nuclear, natural, gas, hydroelectric, wind, and, oil, as, well, as, solar, energy, tidal, power, and, geothermal, sources, in, the, 1880s, the, popularity, of, electricity, grew, massively, with, the, introduction, of, the, incandescent, light, bulb, although, there, are, 22, recognised, inventors, of, the, light, bulb, prior, to, joseph, swan, and, thomas, edison, edison, and, swan, s, invention, became, by, far, the, most, successful, and, popular, of, all, during, the, early, years, of, the, 19th, century, massive, jumps, in, electrical, sciences, were, made, and, by, the, later, 19th, century, the, advancement, of, electrical, technology, and, engineering, led, to, electricity, being, part, of, everyday, life, with, the, introduction, of, many, electrical, inventions, and, their, implementation, into, everyday, life, the, demand, for, electricity, within, homes, grew, dramatically, with, this, increase, in, demand, the, potential, for, profit, was, seen, by, many, entrepreneurs, who, began, investing, into, electrical, systems, to, eventually, create, the, first, electricity, public, utilities, this, process, in, history, is, often, described, as, electrification, the, earliest, distribution, of, electricity, came, from, companies, operating, independently, of, one, another, a, consumer, would, purchase, electricity, from, a, producer, and, the, producer, would, distribute, it, through, their, own, power, grid, as, technology, improved, so, did, the, productivity, and, efficiency, of, its, generation, inventions, such, as, the, steam, turbine, had, a, massive, impact, on, the, efficiency, of, electrical, generation, but, also, the, economics, of, generation, as, well, this, conversion, of, heat, energy, into, mechanical, work, was, similar, to, that, of, steam, engines, however, at, a, significantly, larger, scale, and, far, more, productively, the, improvements, of, these, large, scale, generation, plants, were, critical, to, the, process, of, centralised, generation, as, they, would, become, vital, to, the, entire, power, system, that, we, now, use, today, throughout, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, many, utilities, began, merging, their, distribution, networks, due, to, economic, and, efficiency, benefits, along, with, the, invention, of, long, distance, power, transmission, the, coordination, of, power, plants, began, to, form, this, system, was, then, secured, by, regional, system, operators, to, ensure, stability, and, reliability, the, electrification, of, homes, began, in, northern, europe, and, in, the, northern, america, in, the, 1920s, in, large, cities, and, urban, areas, it, was, not, until, the, 1930s, that, rural, areas, saw, the, large, scale, establishment, of, electrification, 2021, world, electricity, generation, by, source, total, generation, was, 28, petawatt, hours, several, fundamental, methods, exist, to, convert, other, forms, of, energy, into, electrical, energy, utility, scale, generation, is, achieved, by, rotating, electric, generators, or, by, photovoltaic, systems, a, small, proportion, of, electric, power, distributed, by, utilities, is, provided, by, batteries, other, forms, of, electricity, generation, used, in, niche, applications, include, the, triboelectric, effect, the, piezoelectric, effect, the, thermoelectric, effect, and, betavoltaics, electric, generators, transform, kinetic, energy, into, electricity, this, is, the, most, used, form, for, generating, electricity, and, is, based, on, faraday, s, law, it, can, be, seen, experimentally, by, rotating, a, magnet, within, closed, loops, of, conducting, material, e, g, copper, wire, almost, all, commercial, electrical, generation, is, done, using, electromagnetic, induction, in, which, mechanical, energy, forces, a, generator, to, rotate, electrochemistry, is, the, direct, transformation, of, chemical, energy, into, electricity, as, in, a, battery, electrochemical, electricity, generation, is, important, in, portable, and, mobile, applications, currently, most, electrochemical, power, comes, from, batteries, primary, cells, such, as, the, common, zinc, carbon, batteries, act, as, power, sources, directly, but, secondary, cells, i, e, rechargeable, batteries, are, used, for, storage, systems, rather, than, primary, generation, systems, open, electrochemical, systems, known, as, fuel, cells, can, be, used, to, extract, power, either, from, natural, fuels, or, from, synthesized, fuels, osmotic, power, is, a, possibility, at, places, where, salt, and, fresh, water, merge, the, photovoltaic, effect, is, the, transformation, of, light, into, electrical, energy, as, in, solar, cells, photovoltaic, panels, convert, sunlight, directly, to, dc, electricity, power, inverters, can, then, convert, that, to, ac, electricity, if, needed, although, sunlight, is, free, and, abundant, solar, power, electricity, is, still, usually, more, expensive, to, produce, than, large, scale, mechanically, generated, power, due, to, the, cost, of, the, panels, low, efficiency, silicon, solar, cells, have, been, decreasing, in, cost, and, multijunction, cells, with, close, to, 30, conversion, efficiency, are, now, commercially, available, over, 40, efficiency, has, been, demonstrated, in, experimental, systems, until, recently, photovoltaics, were, most, commonly, used, in, remote, sites, where, there, is, no, access, to, a, commercial, power, grid, or, as, a, supplemental, electricity, source, for, individual, homes, and, businesses, recent, advances, in, manufacturing, efficiency, and, photovoltaic, technology, combined, with, subsidies, driven, by, environmental, concerns, have, dramatically, accelerated, the, deployment, of, solar, panels, installed, capacity, is, growing, by, around, 20, per, year, led, by, increases, in, germany, japan, united, states, china, and, india, the, selection, of, electricity, production, modes, and, their, economic, viability, varies, in, accordance, with, demand, and, region, the, economics, vary, considerably, around, the, world, resulting, in, widespread, residential, selling, prices, hydroelectric, plants, nuclear, power, plants, thermal, power, plants, and, renewable, sources, have, their, own, pros, and, cons, and, selection, is, based, upon, the, local, power, requirement, and, the, fluctuations, in, demand, all, power, grids, have, varying, loads, on, them, the, daily, minimum, is, the, base, load, often, supplied, by, plants, which, run, continuously, nuclear, coal, oil, gas, and, some, hydro, plants, can, supply, base, load, if, well, construction, costs, for, natural, gas, are, below, 10, per, mwh, generating, electricity, from, natural, gas, is, cheaper, than, generating, power, by, burning, coal, nuclear, power, plants, can, produce, a, huge, amount, of, power, from, a, single, unit, however, nuclear, disasters, have, raised, concerns, over, the, safety, of, nuclear, power, and, the, capital, cost, of, nuclear, plants, is, very, high, hydroelectric, power, plants, are, located, in, areas, where, the, potential, energy, from, falling, water, can, be, harnessed, for, moving, turbines, and, the, generation, of, power, it, may, not, be, an, economically, viable, single, source, of, production, where, the, ability, to, store, the, flow, of, water, is, limited, and, the, load, varies, too, much, during, the, annual, production, cycle, electric, generators, were, known, in, simple, forms, from, the, discovery, of, electromagnetic, induction, in, the, 1830s, in, general, some, form, of, prime, mover, such, as, an, engine, or, the, turbines, described, above, drives, a, rotating, magnetic, field, past, stationary, coils, of, wire, thereby, turning, mechanical, energy, into, electricity, the, only, commercial, scale, forms, of, electricity, production, that, do, not, employ, a, generator, are, photovoltaic, solar, and, fuel, cells, almost, all, commercial, electrical, power, on, earth, is, generated, with, a, turbine, driven, by, wind, water, steam, or, burning, gas, the, turbine, drives, a, generator, thus, transforming, its, mechanical, energy, into, electrical, energy, by, electromagnetic, induction, there, are, many, different, methods, of, developing, mechanical, energy, including, heat, engines, hydro, wind, and, tidal, power, most, electric, generation, is, driven, by, heat, engines, the, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, supplies, most, of, the, energy, to, these, engines, with, a, significant, fraction, from, nuclear, fission, and, some, from, renewable, sources, the, modern, steam, turbine, invented, by, sir, charles, parsons, in, 1884, currently, generates, about, 80, of, the, electric, power, in, the, world, using, a, variety, of, heat, sources, turbine, types, include, turbines, can, also, use, other, heat, transfer, liquids, than, steam, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, based, cycles, can, provide, higher, conversion, efficiency, due, to, faster, heat, exchange, higher, energy, density, and, simpler, power, cycle, infrastructure, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, blends, that, are, currently, in, development, can, further, increase, efficiency, by, optimizing, its, critical, pressure, and, temperature, points, although, turbines, are, most, common, in, commercial, power, generation, smaller, generators, can, be, powered, by, gasoline, or, diesel, engines, these, may, used, for, backup, generation, or, as, a, prime, source, of, power, within, isolated, villages, total, world, generation, in, 2021, was, 28, 003, twh, including, coal, 36, gas, 23, hydro, 15, nuclear, 10, wind, 6, 6, solar, 3, 7, oil, and, other, fossil, fuels, 3, 1, biomass, 2, 4, and, geothermal, and, other, renewables, 0, 33, china, produced, a, third, of, the, world, s, electricity, in, 2021, largely, from, coal, the, united, states, produces, half, as, much, as, china, but, uses, far, more, natural, gas, and, nuclear, variations, between, countries, generating, electrical, power, affect, concerns, about, the, environment, in, france, only, 10, of, electricity, is, generated, from, fossil, fuels, the, us, is, higher, at, 70, and, china, is, at, 80, the, cleanliness, of, electricity, depends, on, its, source, methane, leaks, from, natural, gas, to, fuel, gas, fired, power, plants, and, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, fossil, fuel, based, electricity, generation, account, for, a, significant, portion, of, world, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, the, united, states, fossil, fuel, combustion, for, electric, power, generation, is, responsible, for, 65, of, all, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, the, main, component, of, acid, rain, electricity, generation, is, the, fourth, highest, combined, source, of, no, x, carbon, monoxide, and, particulate, matter, in, the, us, according, to, the, international, energy, agency, iea, low, carbon, electricity, generation, needs, to, account, for, 85, of, global, electrical, output, by, 2040, in, order, to, ward, off, the, worst, effects, of, climate, change, like, other, organizations, including, the, energy, impact, center, eic, and, the, united, nations, economic, commission, for, europe, unece, the, iea, has, called, for, the, expansion, of, nuclear, and, renewable, energy, to, meet, that, objective, some, like, eic, founder, bret, kugelmass, believe, that, nuclear, power, is, the, primary, method, for, decarbonizing, electricity, generation, because, it, can, also, power, direct, air, capture, that, removes, existing, carbon, emissions, from, the, atmosphere, nuclear, power, plants, can, also, create, district, heating, and, desalination, projects, limiting, carbon, emissions, and, the, need, for, expanded, electrical, output, a, fundamental, issue, regarding, centralised, generation, and, the, current, electrical, generation, methods, in, use, today, is, the, significant, negative, environmental, effects, that, many, of, the, generation, processes, have, processes, such, as, coal, and, gas, not, only, release, carbon, dioxide, as, they, combust, but, their, extraction, from, the, ground, also, impacts, the, environment, open, pit, coal, mines, use, large, areas, of, land, to, extract, coal, and, limit, the, potential, for, productive, land, use, after, the, excavation, natural, gas, extraction, releases, large, amounts, of, methane, into, the, atmosphere, when, extracted, from, the, ground, greatly, increase, global, greenhouse, gases, although, nuclear, power, plants, do, not, release, carbon, dioxide, through, electricity, generation, there, are, risks, associated, with, nuclear, waste, and, safety, concerns, associated, with, the, use, of, nuclear, sources, per, unit, of, electricity, generated, coal, and, gas, fired, power, life, cycle, greenhouse, gas, emissions, are, almost, always, at, least, ten, times, that, of, other, generation, methods, centralised, generation, is, electricity, generation, by, large, scale, centralised, facilities, sent, through, transmission, lines, to, consumers, these, facilities, are, usually, located, far, away, from, consumers, and, distribute, the, electricity, through, high, voltage, transmission, lines, to, a, substation, where, it, is, then, distributed, to, consumers, the, basic, concept, being, that, multi, megawatt, or, gigawatt, scale, large, stations, create, electricity, for, a, large, number, of, people, the, vast, majority, of, electricity, used, is, created, from, centralised, generation, most, centralised, power, generation, comes, from, large, power, plants, run, by, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, or, natural, gas, though, nuclear, or, large, hydroelectricity, plants, are, also, commonly, used, centralised, generation, is, fundamentally, the, opposite, of, distributed, generation, distributed, generation, is, the, small, scale, generation, of, electricity, to, smaller, groups, of, consumers, this, can, also, include, independently, producing, electricity, by, either, solar, or, wind, power, in, recent, years, distributed, generation, as, has, seen, a, spark, in, popularity, due, to, its, propensity, to, use, renewable, energy, generation, methods, such, as, rooftop, solar, centralised, energy, sources, are, large, power, plants, that, produce, huge, amounts, of, electricity, to, a, large, number, of, consumers, most, power, plants, used, in, centralised, generation, are, thermal, power, plants, meaning, that, they, use, a, fuel, to, heat, steam, to, produce, a, pressurised, gas, which, in, turn, spins, a, turbine, and, generates, electricity, this, is, the, traditional, way, of, producing, energy, this, process, relies, on, several, forms, of, technology, to, produce, widespread, electricity, these, being, natural, coal, gas, and, nuclear, forms, of, thermal, generation, more, recently, solar, and, wind, have, become, large, scale, a, photovoltaic, power, station, also, known, as, a, solar, park, solar, farm, or, solar, power, plant, is, a, large, scale, grid, connected, photovoltaic, power, system, pv, system, designed, for, the, supply, of, merchant, power, they, are, different, from, most, building, mounted, and, other, decentralized, solar, power, because, they, supply, power, at, the, utility, level, rather, than, to, a, local, user, or, users, utility, scale, solar, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, this, type, of, project, this, approach, differs, from, concentrated, solar, power, the, other, major, large, scale, solar, generation, technology, which, uses, heat, to, drive, a, variety, of, conventional, generator, systems, both, approaches, have, their, own, advantages, and, disadvantages, but, to, date, for, a, variety, of, reasons, photovoltaic, technology, has, seen, much, wider, use, as, of, 2019, about, 97, of, utility, scale, solar, power, capacity, was, pv, in, some, countries, the, nameplate, capacity, of, photovoltaic, power, stations, is, rated, in, megawatt, peak, mw, p, which, refers, to, the, solar, array, s, theoretical, maximum, dc, power, output, in, other, countries, the, manufacturer, states, the, surface, and, the, efficiency, however, canada, japan, spain, and, the, united, states, often, specify, using, the, converted, lower, nominal, power, output, in, mw, ac, a, measure, more, directly, comparable, to, other, forms, of, power, generation, most, solar, parks, are, developed, at, a, scale, of, at, least, 1, mw, p, as, of, 2018, the, world, s, largest, operating, photovoltaic, power, stations, surpassed, 1, gigawatt, at, the, end, of, 2019, about, 9, 000, solar, farms, were, larger, than, 4, mw, ac, utility, scale, with, a, combined, capacity, of, over, 220, gw, ac, a, wind, farm, or, wind, park, also, called, a, wind, power, station, or, wind, power, plant, is, a, group, of, wind, turbines, in, the, same, location, used, to, produce, electricity, wind, farms, vary, in, size, from, a, small, number, of, turbines, to, several, hundred, wind, turbines, covering, an, extensive, area, wind, farms, can, be, either, onshore, or, offshore, many, of, the, largest, operational, onshore, wind, farms, are, located, in, china, india, and, the, united, states, for, example, the, largest, wind, farm, in, the, world, gansu, wind, farm, in, china, had, a, capacity, of, over, 6, 000, mw, by, 2012, with, a, goal, of, 20, 000, mw, by, 2020, as, of, december, 2020, the, 1218, mw, hornsea, wind, farm, in, the, uk, is, the, largest, offshore, wind, farm, in, the, world, individual, wind, turbine, designs, continue, to, increase, in, power, resulting, in, fewer, turbines, being, needed, for, the, same, total, output, a, coal, fired, power, station, or, coal, power, plant, is, a, thermal, power, station, which, burns, coal, to, generate, electricity, worldwide, there, are, over, 2, 400, coal, fired, power, stations, totaling, over, 2, 130, gigawatts, capacity, they, generate, about, a, third, of, the, world, s, electricity, but, cause, many, illnesses, and, the, most, early, deaths, mainly, from, air, pollution, world, installed, capacity, doubled, from, 2000, to, 2023, and, increased, 2, in, 2023, a, coal, fired, power, station, is, a, type, of, fossil, fuel, power, station, the, coal, is, usually, pulverized, and, then, burned, in, a, pulverized, coal, fired, boiler, the, furnace, heat, converts, boiler, water, to, steam, which, is, then, used, to, spin, turbines, that, turn, generators, thus, chemical, energy, stored, in, coal, is, converted, successively, into, thermal, energy, mechanical, energy, and, finally, electrical, energy, natural, gas, is, ignited, to, create, pressurised, gas, which, is, used, to, spin, turbines, to, generate, electricity, natural, gas, plants, use, a, gas, turbine, where, natural, gas, is, added, along, with, oxygen, which, in, turn, combusts, and, expands, through, the, turbine, to, force, a, generator, to, spin, natural, gas, power, plants, are, more, efficient, than, coal, power, generation, they, however, contribute, to, climate, change, but, not, as, highly, as, coal, generation, not, only, do, they, produce, carbon, dioxide, from, the, ignition, of, natural, gas, the, extraction, of, gas, when, mined, releases, a, significant, amount, of, methane, into, the, atmosphere, nuclear, power, plants, create, electricity, through, steam, turbines, where, the, heat, input, is, from, the, process, of, nuclear, fission, currently, nuclear, power, produces, 11, of, all, electricity, in, the, world, most, nuclear, reactors, use, uranium, as, a, source, of, fuel, in, a, process, called, nuclear, fission, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, is, released, when, nuclear, atoms, are, split, electricity, is, created, through, the, use, of, a, nuclear, reactor, where, heat, produced, by, nuclear, fission, is, used, to, produce, steam, which, in, turn, spins, turbines, and, powers, the, generators, although, there, are, several, types, of, nuclear, reactors, all, fundamentally, use, this, process, normal, emissions, due, to, nuclear, power, plants, are, primarily, waste, heat, and, radioactive, spent, fuel, in, a, reactor, accident, significant, amounts, of, radioisotopes, can, be, released, to, the, environment, posing, a, long, term, hazard, to, life, this, hazard, has, been, a, continuing, concern, of, environmentalists, accidents, such, as, the, three, mile, island, accident, chernobyl, disaster, and, the, fukushima, nuclear, disaster, illustrate, this, problem, the, table, lists, 45, countries, with, their, total, electricity, capacities, the, data, is, from, 2022, according, to, the, energy, information, administration, the, total, global, electricity, capacity, in, 2022, was, nearly, 8, 9, terawatt, tw, more, than, four, times, the, total, global, electricity, capacity, in, 1981, the, global, average, per, capita, electricity, capacity, was, about, 1, 120, watts, in, 2022, nearly, two, and, a, half, times, the, global, average, per, capita, electricity, capacity, in, 1981, iceland, has, the, highest, installed, capacity, per, capita, in, the, world, at, about, 8, 990, watts, all, developed, countries, have, an, average, per, capita, electricity, capacity, above, the, global, average, per, capita, electricity, capacity, with, the, united, kingdom, having, the, lowest, average, per, capita, electricity, capacity, of, all, other, developed, countries
