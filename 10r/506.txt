a, castle, is, a, type, of, fortified, structure, built, during, the, middle, ages, predominantly, by, the, nobility, or, royalty, and, by, military, orders, scholars, usually, consider, a, castle, to, be, the, private, fortified, residence, of, a, lord, or, noble, this, is, distinct, from, a, mansion, palace, and, villa, whose, main, purpose, was, exclusively, for, pleasance, and, are, not, primarily, fortresses, but, may, be, fortified, use, of, the, term, has, varied, over, time, and, sometimes, has, also, been, applied, to, structures, such, as, hill, forts, and, 19th, and, 20th, century, homes, built, to, resemble, castles, over, the, middle, ages, when, genuine, castles, were, built, they, took, on, a, great, many, forms, with, many, different, features, although, some, such, as, curtain, walls, arrowslits, and, portcullises, were, commonplace, european, style, castles, originated, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, carolingian, empire, resulted, in, its, territory, being, divided, among, individual, lords, and, princes, these, nobles, built, castles, to, control, the, area, immediately, surrounding, them, and, the, castles, were, both, offensive, and, defensive, structures, they, provided, a, base, from, which, raids, could, be, launched, as, well, as, offered, protection, from, enemies, although, their, military, origins, are, often, emphasised, in, castle, studies, the, structures, also, served, as, centres, of, administration, and, symbols, of, power, urban, castles, were, used, to, control, the, local, populace, and, important, travel, routes, and, rural, castles, were, often, situated, near, features, that, were, integral, to, life, in, the, community, such, as, mills, fertile, land, or, a, water, source, many, northern, european, castles, were, originally, built, from, earth, and, timber, but, had, their, defences, replaced, later, by, stone, early, castles, often, exploited, natural, defences, lacking, features, such, as, towers, and, arrowslits, and, relying, on, a, central, keep, in, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, a, scientific, approach, to, castle, defence, emerged, this, led, to, the, proliferation, of, towers, with, an, emphasis, on, flanking, fire, many, new, castles, were, polygonal, or, relied, on, concentric, defence, several, stages, of, defence, within, each, other, that, could, all, function, at, the, same, time, to, maximise, the, castle, s, firepower, these, changes, in, defence, have, been, attributed, to, a, mixture, of, castle, technology, from, the, crusades, such, as, concentric, fortification, and, inspiration, from, earlier, defences, such, as, roman, forts, not, all, the, elements, of, castle, architecture, were, military, in, nature, so, that, devices, such, as, moats, evolved, from, their, original, purpose, of, defence, into, symbols, of, power, some, grand, castles, had, long, winding, approaches, intended, to, impress, and, dominate, their, landscape, although, gunpowder, was, introduced, to, europe, in, the, 14th, century, it, did, not, significantly, affect, castle, building, until, the, 15th, century, when, artillery, became, powerful, enough, to, break, through, stone, walls, while, castles, continued, to, be, built, well, into, the, 16th, century, new, techniques, to, deal, with, improved, cannon, fire, made, them, uncomfortable, and, undesirable, places, to, live, as, a, result, true, castles, went, into, decline, and, were, replaced, by, artillery, star, forts, with, no, role, in, civil, administration, and, ch, teau, or, country, houses, that, were, indefensible, from, the, 18th, century, onwards, there, was, a, renewed, interest, in, castles, with, the, construction, of, mock, castles, part, of, a, romantic, revival, of, gothic, architecture, but, they, had, no, military, purpose, the, word, castle, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, castellum, which, is, a, diminutive, of, the, word, castrum, meaning, fortified, place, the, old, english, castel, occitan, castel, or, chastel, french, ch, teau, spanish, castillo, portuguese, castelo, italian, castello, and, a, number, of, words, in, other, languages, also, derive, from, castellum, the, word, castle, was, introduced, into, english, shortly, before, the, norman, conquest, to, denote, this, type, of, building, which, was, then, new, to, england, in, its, simplest, terms, the, definition, of, a, castle, accepted, amongst, academics, is, a, private, fortified, residence, this, contrasts, with, earlier, fortifications, such, as, anglo, saxon, burhs, and, walled, cities, such, as, constantinople, and, antioch, in, the, middle, east, castles, were, not, communal, defences, but, were, built, and, owned, by, the, local, feudal, lords, either, for, themselves, or, for, their, monarch, feudalism, was, the, link, between, a, lord, and, his, vassal, where, in, return, for, military, service, and, the, expectation, of, loyalty, the, lord, would, grant, the, vassal, land, in, the, late, 20th, century, there, was, a, trend, to, refine, the, definition, of, a, castle, by, including, the, criterion, of, feudal, ownership, thus, tying, castles, to, the, medieval, period, however, this, does, not, necessarily, reflect, the, terminology, used, in, the, medieval, period, during, the, first, crusade, 1096, 1099, the, frankish, armies, encountered, walled, settlements, and, forts, that, they, indiscriminately, referred, to, as, castles, but, which, would, not, be, considered, as, such, under, the, modern, definition, castles, served, a, range, of, purposes, the, most, important, of, which, were, military, administrative, and, domestic, as, well, as, defensive, structures, castles, were, also, offensive, tools, which, could, be, used, as, a, base, of, operations, in, enemy, territory, castles, were, established, by, norman, invaders, of, england, for, both, defensive, purposes, and, to, pacify, the, country, s, inhabitants, as, william, the, conqueror, advanced, through, england, he, fortified, key, positions, to, secure, the, land, he, had, taken, between, 1066, and, 1087, he, established, 36, castles, such, as, warwick, castle, which, he, used, to, guard, against, rebellion, in, the, english, midlands, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, castles, tended, to, lose, their, military, significance, due, to, the, advent, of, powerful, cannons, and, permanent, artillery, fortifications, as, a, result, castles, became, more, important, as, residences, and, statements, of, power, a, castle, could, act, as, a, stronghold, and, prison, but, was, also, a, place, where, a, knight, or, lord, could, entertain, his, peers, over, time, the, aesthetics, of, the, design, became, more, important, as, the, castle, s, appearance, and, size, began, to, reflect, the, prestige, and, power, of, its, occupant, comfortable, homes, were, often, fashioned, within, their, fortified, walls, although, castles, still, provided, protection, from, low, levels, of, violence, in, later, periods, eventually, they, were, succeeded, by, country, houses, as, high, status, residences, castle, is, sometimes, used, as, a, catch, all, term, for, all, kinds, of, fortifications, and, as, a, result, has, been, misapplied, in, the, technical, sense, an, example, of, this, is, maiden, castle, which, despite, the, name, is, an, iron, age, hill, fort, which, had, a, very, different, origin, and, purpose, although, castle, has, not, become, a, generic, term, for, a, manor, house, like, ch, teau, in, french, and, schloss, in, german, many, manor, houses, contain, castle, in, their, name, while, having, few, if, any, of, the, architectural, characteristics, usually, as, their, owners, liked, to, maintain, a, link, to, the, past, and, felt, the, term, castle, was, a, masculine, expression, of, their, power, in, scholarship, the, castle, as, defined, above, is, generally, accepted, as, a, coherent, concept, originating, in, europe, and, later, spreading, to, parts, of, the, middle, east, where, they, were, introduced, by, european, crusaders, this, coherent, group, shared, a, common, origin, dealt, with, a, particular, mode, of, warfare, and, exchanged, influences, in, different, areas, of, the, world, analogous, structures, shared, features, of, fortification, and, other, defining, characteristics, associated, with, the, concept, of, a, castle, though, they, originated, in, different, periods, and, circumstances, and, experienced, differing, evolutions, and, influences, for, example, shiro, in, japan, described, as, castles, by, historian, stephen, turnbull, underwent, a, completely, different, developmental, history, were, built, in, a, completely, different, way, and, were, designed, to, withstand, attacks, of, a, completely, different, nature, while, european, castles, built, from, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, century, onwards, were, generally, stone, shiro, were, predominantly, timber, buildings, into, the, 16th, century, by, the, 16th, century, when, japanese, and, european, cultures, met, fortification, in, europe, had, moved, beyond, castles, and, relied, on, innovations, such, as, the, italian, trace, italienne, and, star, forts, a, motte, was, an, earthen, mound, with, a, flat, top, it, was, often, artificial, although, sometimes, it, incorporated, a, pre, existing, feature, of, the, landscape, the, excavation, of, earth, to, make, the, mound, left, a, ditch, around, the, motte, called, a, moat, which, could, be, either, wet, or, dry, although, the, motte, is, commonly, associated, with, the, bailey, to, form, a, motte, and, bailey, castle, this, was, not, always, the, case, and, there, are, instances, where, a, motte, existed, on, its, own, motte, refers, to, the, mound, alone, but, it, was, often, surmounted, by, a, fortified, structure, such, as, a, keep, and, the, flat, top, would, be, surrounded, by, a, palisade, it, was, common, for, the, motte, to, be, reached, over, a, flying, bridge, a, bridge, over, the, ditch, from, the, counterscarp, of, the, ditch, to, the, edge, of, the, top, of, the, mound, as, shown, in, the, bayeux, tapestry, s, depiction, of, ch, teau, de, dinan, sometimes, a, motte, covered, an, older, castle, or, hall, whose, rooms, became, underground, storage, areas, and, prisons, beneath, a, new, keep, a, bailey, also, called, a, ward, was, a, fortified, enclosure, it, was, a, common, feature, of, castles, and, most, had, at, least, one, the, keep, on, top, of, the, motte, was, the, domicile, of, the, lord, in, charge, of, the, castle, and, a, bastion, of, last, defence, while, the, bailey, was, the, home, of, the, rest, of, the, lord, s, household, and, gave, them, protection, the, barracks, for, the, garrison, stables, workshops, and, storage, facilities, were, often, found, in, the, bailey, water, was, supplied, by, a, well, or, cistern, over, time, the, focus, of, high, status, accommodation, shifted, from, the, keep, to, the, bailey, this, resulted, in, the, creation, of, another, bailey, that, separated, the, high, status, buildings, such, as, the, lord, s, chambers, and, the, chapel, from, the, everyday, structures, such, as, the, workshops, and, barracks, from, the, late, 12th, century, there, was, a, trend, for, knights, to, move, out, of, the, small, houses, they, had, previously, occupied, within, the, bailey, to, live, in, fortified, houses, in, the, countryside, although, often, associated, with, the, motte, and, bailey, type, of, castle, baileys, could, also, be, found, as, independent, defensive, structures, these, simple, fortifications, were, called, ringworks, the, enceinte, was, the, castle, s, main, defensive, enclosure, and, the, terms, bailey, and, enceinte, are, linked, a, castle, could, have, several, baileys, but, only, one, enceinte, castles, with, no, keep, which, relied, on, their, outer, defences, for, protection, are, sometimes, called, enceinte, castles, these, were, the, earliest, form, of, castles, before, the, keep, was, introduced, in, the, 10th, century, a, keep, was, a, great, tower, or, other, building, that, served, as, the, main, living, quarters, of, the, castle, and, usually, the, most, strongly, defended, point, of, a, castle, before, the, introduction, of, concentric, defence, keep, was, not, a, term, used, in, the, medieval, period, the, term, was, applied, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, instead, donjon, was, used, to, refer, to, great, towers, or, turris, in, latin, in, motte, and, bailey, castles, the, keep, was, on, top, of, the, motte, dungeon, is, a, corrupted, form, of, donjon, and, means, a, dark, unwelcoming, prison, although, often, the, strongest, part, of, a, castle, and, a, last, place, of, refuge, if, the, outer, defences, fell, the, keep, was, not, left, empty, in, case, of, attack, but, was, used, as, a, residence, by, the, lord, who, owned, the, castle, or, his, guests, or, representatives, at, first, this, was, usual, only, in, england, when, after, the, norman, conquest, of, 1066, the, conquerors, lived, for, a, long, time, in, a, constant, state, of, alert, elsewhere, the, lord, s, wife, presided, over, a, separate, residence, domus, aula, or, mansio, in, latin, close, to, the, keep, and, the, donjon, was, a, barracks, and, headquarters, gradually, the, two, functions, merged, into, the, same, building, and, the, highest, residential, storeys, had, large, windows, as, a, result, for, many, structures, it, is, difficult, to, find, an, appropriate, term, the, massive, internal, spaces, seen, in, many, surviving, donjons, can, be, misleading, they, would, have, been, divided, into, several, rooms, by, light, partitions, as, in, a, modern, office, building, even, in, some, large, castles, the, great, hall, was, separated, only, by, a, partition, from, the, lord, s, chamber, his, bedroom, and, to, some, extent, his, office, curtain, walls, were, defensive, walls, enclosing, a, bailey, they, had, to, be, high, enough, to, make, scaling, the, walls, with, ladders, difficult, and, thick, enough, to, withstand, bombardment, from, siege, engines, which, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, included, gunpowder, artillery, a, typical, wall, could, be, 3, m, 10, ft, thick, and, 12, m, 39, ft, tall, although, sizes, varied, greatly, between, castles, to, protect, them, from, undermining, curtain, walls, were, sometimes, given, a, stone, skirt, around, their, bases, walkways, along, the, tops, of, the, curtain, walls, allowed, defenders, to, rain, missiles, on, enemies, below, and, battlements, gave, them, further, protection, curtain, walls, were, studded, with, towers, to, allow, enfilading, fire, along, the, wall, arrowslits, in, the, walls, did, not, become, common, in, europe, until, the, 13th, century, for, fear, that, they, might, compromise, the, wall, s, strength, the, entrance, was, often, the, weakest, part, in, a, circuit, of, defences, to, overcome, this, the, gatehouse, was, developed, allowing, those, inside, the, castle, to, control, the, flow, of, traffic, in, earth, and, timber, castles, the, gateway, was, usually, the, first, feature, to, be, rebuilt, in, stone, the, front, of, the, gateway, was, a, blind, spot, and, to, overcome, this, projecting, towers, were, added, on, each, side, of, the, gate, in, a, style, similar, to, that, developed, by, the, romans, the, gatehouse, contained, a, series, of, defences, to, make, a, direct, assault, more, difficult, than, battering, down, a, simple, gate, typically, there, were, one, or, more, portcullises, a, wooden, grille, reinforced, with, metal, to, block, a, passage, and, arrowslits, to, allow, defenders, to, harry, the, enemy, the, passage, through, the, gatehouse, was, lengthened, to, increase, the, amount, of, time, an, assailant, had, to, spend, under, fire, in, a, confined, space, and, unable, to, retaliate, it, is, a, popular, myth, that, murder, holes, openings, in, the, ceiling, of, the, gateway, passage, were, used, to, pour, boiling, oil, or, molten, lead, on, attackers, the, price, of, oil, and, lead, and, the, distance, of, the, gatehouse, from, fires, meant, that, this, was, impractical, this, method, was, however, a, common, practice, in, middle, eastern, and, mediterranean, castles, and, fortifications, where, such, resources, were, abundant, they, were, most, likely, used, to, drop, objects, on, attackers, or, to, allow, water, to, be, poured, on, fires, to, extinguish, them, provision, was, made, in, the, upper, storey, of, the, gatehouse, for, accommodation, so, the, gate, was, never, left, undefended, although, this, arrangement, later, evolved, to, become, more, comfortable, at, the, expense, of, defence, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, the, barbican, was, developed, this, consisted, of, a, rampart, ditch, and, possibly, a, tower, in, front, of, the, gatehouse, which, could, be, used, to, further, protect, the, entrance, the, purpose, of, a, barbican, was, not, just, to, provide, another, line, of, defence, but, also, to, dictate, the, only, approach, to, the, gate, a, moat, was, a, ditch, surrounding, a, castle, or, dividing, one, part, of, a, castle, from, another, and, could, be, either, dry, or, filled, with, water, its, purpose, often, had, a, defensive, purpose, preventing, siege, towers, from, reaching, walls, making, mining, harder, but, could, also, be, ornamental, water, moats, were, found, in, low, lying, areas, and, were, usually, crossed, by, a, drawbridge, although, these, were, often, replaced, by, stone, bridges, the, site, of, the, 13th, century, caerphilly, castle, in, wales, covers, over, 30, acres, 12, ha, and, the, water, defences, created, by, flooding, the, valley, to, the, south, of, the, castle, are, some, of, the, largest, in, western, europe, battlements, were, most, often, found, surmounting, curtain, walls, and, the, tops, of, gatehouses, and, comprised, several, elements, crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and, loopholes, crenellation, is, the, collective, name, for, alternating, crenels, and, merlons, gaps, and, solid, blocks, on, top, of, a, wall, hoardings, were, wooden, constructs, that, projected, beyond, the, wall, allowing, defenders, to, shoot, at, or, drop, objects, on, attackers, at, the, base, of, the, wall, without, having, to, lean, perilously, over, the, crenellations, thereby, exposing, themselves, to, retaliatory, fire, machicolations, were, stone, projections, on, top, of, a, wall, with, openings, that, allowed, objects, to, be, dropped, on, an, enemy, at, the, base, of, the, wall, in, a, similar, fashion, to, hoardings, arrowslits, also, commonly, called, loopholes, were, narrow, vertical, openings, in, defensive, walls, which, allowed, arrows, or, crossbow, bolts, to, be, fired, on, attackers, the, narrow, slits, were, intended, to, protect, the, defender, by, providing, a, very, small, target, but, the, size, of, the, opening, could, also, impede, the, defender, if, it, was, too, small, a, smaller, horizontal, opening, could, be, added, to, give, an, archer, a, better, view, for, aiming, sometimes, a, sally, port, was, included, this, could, allow, the, garrison, to, leave, the, castle, and, engage, besieging, forces, it, was, usual, for, the, latrines, to, empty, down, the, external, walls, of, a, castle, and, into, the, surrounding, ditch, a, postern, is, a, secondary, door, or, gate, in, a, concealed, location, usually, in, a, fortification, such, as, a, city, wall, the, great, hall, was, a, large, decorated, room, where, a, lord, received, his, guests, the, hall, represented, the, prestige, authority, and, richness, of, the, lord, events, such, as, feasts, banquets, social, or, ceremonial, gatherings, meetings, of, the, military, council, and, judicial, trials, were, held, in, the, great, hall, sometimes, the, great, hall, existed, as, a, separate, building, in, that, case, it, was, called, a, hall, house, historian, charles, coulson, states, that, the, accumulation, of, wealth, and, resources, such, as, food, led, to, the, need, for, defensive, structures, the, earliest, fortifications, originated, in, the, fertile, crescent, the, indus, valley, europe, egypt, and, china, where, settlements, were, protected, by, large, walls, in, northern, europe, hill, forts, were, first, developed, in, the, bronze, age, which, then, proliferated, across, europe, in, the, iron, age, hillforts, in, britain, typically, used, earthworks, rather, than, stone, as, a, building, material, many, earthworks, survive, today, along, with, evidence, of, palisades, to, accompany, the, ditches, in, central, and, western, europe, oppida, emerged, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, these, were, densely, inhabited, fortified, settlements, such, as, the, oppidum, of, manching, some, oppida, walls, were, built, on, a, massive, scale, utilising, stone, wood, iron, and, earth, in, their, construction, the, romans, encountered, fortified, settlements, such, as, hill, forts, and, oppida, when, expanding, their, territory, into, northern, europe, their, defences, were, often, effective, and, were, only, overcome, by, the, extensive, use, of, siege, engines, and, other, siege, warfare, techniques, such, as, at, the, battle, of, alesia, the, romans, own, fortifications, castra, varied, from, simple, temporary, earthworks, thrown, up, by, armies, on, the, move, to, elaborate, permanent, stone, constructions, notably, the, milecastles, of, hadrian, s, wall, roman, forts, were, generally, rectangular, with, rounded, corners, a, playing, card, shape, in, the, medieval, period, castles, were, influenced, by, earlier, forms, of, elite, architecture, contributing, to, regional, variations, importantly, while, castles, had, military, aspects, they, contained, a, recognisable, household, structure, within, their, walls, reflecting, the, multi, functional, use, of, these, buildings, the, subject, of, the, emergence, of, castles, in, europe, is, a, complex, matter, which, has, led, to, considerable, debate, discussions, have, typically, attributed, the, rise, of, the, castle, to, a, reaction, to, attacks, by, magyars, muslims, and, vikings, and, a, need, for, private, defence, the, breakdown, of, the, carolingian, empire, led, to, the, privatisation, of, government, and, local, lords, assumed, responsibility, for, the, economy, and, justice, however, while, castles, proliferated, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, link, between, periods, of, insecurity, and, building, fortifications, is, not, always, straightforward, some, high, concentrations, of, castles, occur, in, secure, places, while, some, border, regions, had, relatively, few, castles, it, is, likely, that, the, castle, evolved, from, the, practice, of, fortifying, a, lordly, home, the, greatest, threat, to, a, lord, s, home, or, hall, was, fire, as, it, was, usually, a, wooden, structure, to, protect, against, this, and, keep, other, threats, at, bay, there, were, several, courses, of, action, available, create, encircling, earthworks, to, keep, an, enemy, at, a, distance, build, the, hall, in, stone, or, raise, it, up, on, an, artificial, mound, known, as, a, motte, to, present, an, obstacle, to, attackers, while, the, concept, of, ditches, ramparts, and, stone, walls, as, defensive, measures, is, ancient, raising, a, motte, is, a, medieval, innovation, a, bank, and, ditch, enclosure, was, a, simple, form, of, defence, and, when, found, without, an, associated, motte, is, called, a, ringwork, when, the, site, was, in, use, for, a, prolonged, period, it, was, sometimes, replaced, by, a, more, complex, structure, or, enhanced, by, the, addition, of, a, stone, curtain, wall, building, the, hall, in, stone, did, not, necessarily, make, it, immune, to, fire, as, it, still, had, windows, and, a, wooden, door, this, led, to, the, elevation, of, windows, to, the, second, storey, to, make, it, harder, to, throw, objects, in, and, to, move, the, entrance, from, ground, level, to, the, second, storey, these, features, are, seen, in, many, surviving, castle, keeps, which, were, the, more, sophisticated, version, of, halls, castles, were, not, just, defensive, sites, but, also, enhanced, a, lord, s, control, over, his, lands, they, allowed, the, garrison, to, control, the, surrounding, area, and, formed, a, centre, of, administration, providing, the, lord, with, a, place, to, hold, court, building, a, castle, sometimes, required, the, permission, of, the, king, or, other, high, authority, in, 864, the, king, of, west, francia, charles, the, bald, prohibited, the, construction, of, castella, without, his, permission, and, ordered, them, all, to, be, destroyed, this, is, perhaps, the, earliest, reference, to, castles, though, military, historian, r, allen, brown, points, out, that, the, word, castella, may, have, applied, to, any, fortification, at, the, time, in, some, countries, the, monarch, had, little, control, over, lords, or, required, the, construction, of, new, castles, to, aid, in, securing, the, land, so, was, unconcerned, about, granting, permission, as, was, the, case, in, england, in, the, aftermath, of, the, norman, conquest, and, the, holy, land, during, the, crusades, switzerland, is, an, extreme, case, of, there, being, no, state, control, over, who, built, castles, and, as, a, result, there, were, 4, 000, in, the, country, there, are, very, few, castles, dated, with, certainty, from, the, mid, 9th, century, converted, into, a, donjon, around, 950, ch, teau, de, dou, la, fontaine, in, france, is, the, oldest, standing, castle, in, europe, from, 1000, onwards, references, to, castles, in, texts, such, as, charters, increased, greatly, historians, have, interpreted, this, as, evidence, of, a, sudden, increase, in, the, number, of, castles, in, europe, around, this, time, this, has, been, supported, by, archaeological, investigation, which, has, dated, the, construction, of, castle, sites, through, the, examination, of, ceramics, the, increase, in, italy, began, in, the, 950s, with, numbers, of, castles, increasing, by, a, factor, of, three, to, five, every, 50, years, whereas, in, other, parts, of, europe, such, as, france, and, spain, the, growth, was, slower, in, 950, provence, was, home, to, 12, castles, by, 1000, this, figure, had, risen, to, 30, and, by, 1030, it, was, over, 100, although, the, increase, was, slower, in, spain, the, 1020s, saw, a, particular, growth, in, the, number, of, castles, in, the, region, particularly, in, contested, border, areas, between, christian, and, muslim, lands, despite, the, common, period, in, which, castles, rose, to, prominence, in, europe, their, form, and, design, varied, from, region, to, region, in, the, early, 11th, century, the, motte, and, keep, an, artificial, mound, with, a, palisade, and, tower, on, top, was, the, most, common, form, of, castle, in, europe, everywhere, except, scandinavia, while, britain, france, and, italy, shared, a, tradition, of, timber, construction, that, was, continued, in, castle, architecture, spain, more, commonly, used, stone, or, mud, brick, as, the, main, building, material, the, muslim, invasion, of, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, 8th, century, introduced, a, style, of, building, developed, in, north, africa, reliant, on, tapial, pebbles, in, cement, where, timber, was, in, short, supply, although, stone, construction, would, later, become, common, elsewhere, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, it, was, the, primary, building, material, for, christian, castles, in, spain, while, at, the, same, time, timber, was, still, the, dominant, building, material, in, north, west, europe, historians, have, interpreted, the, widespread, presence, of, castles, across, europe, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, as, evidence, that, warfare, was, common, and, usually, between, local, lords, castles, were, introduced, into, england, shortly, before, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, before, the, 12th, century, castles, were, as, uncommon, in, denmark, as, they, had, been, in, england, before, the, norman, conquest, the, introduction, of, castles, to, denmark, was, a, reaction, to, attacks, from, wendish, pirates, and, they, were, usually, intended, as, coastal, defences, the, motte, and, bailey, remained, the, dominant, form, of, castle, in, england, wales, and, ireland, well, into, the, 12th, century, at, the, same, time, castle, architecture, in, mainland, europe, became, more, sophisticated, the, donjon, was, at, the, centre, of, this, change, in, castle, architecture, in, the, 12th, century, central, towers, proliferated, and, typically, had, a, square, plan, with, walls, 3, to, 4, m, 9, 8, to, 13, 1, ft, thick, their, decoration, emulated, romanesque, architecture, and, sometimes, incorporated, double, windows, similar, to, those, found, in, church, bell, towers, donjons, which, were, the, residence, of, the, lord, of, the, castle, evolved, to, become, more, spacious, the, design, emphasis, of, donjons, changed, to, reflect, a, shift, from, functional, to, decorative, requirements, imposing, a, symbol, of, lordly, power, upon, the, landscape, this, sometimes, led, to, compromising, defence, for, the, sake, of, display, until, the, 12th, century, stone, built, and, earth, and, timber, castles, were, contemporary, but, by, the, late, 12th, century, the, number, of, castles, being, built, went, into, decline, this, has, been, partly, attributed, to, the, higher, cost, of, stone, built, fortifications, and, the, obsolescence, of, timber, and, earthwork, sites, which, meant, it, was, preferable, to, build, in, more, durable, stone, although, superseded, by, their, stone, successors, timber, and, earthwork, castles, were, by, no, means, useless, this, is, evidenced, by, the, continual, maintenance, of, timber, castles, over, long, periods, sometimes, several, centuries, owain, glynd, r, s, 11th, century, timber, castle, at, sycharth, was, still, in, use, by, the, start, of, the, 15th, century, its, structure, having, been, maintained, for, four, centuries, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, change, in, castle, architecture, until, the, late, 12th, century, castles, generally, had, few, towers, a, gateway, with, few, defensive, features, such, as, arrowslits, or, a, portcullis, a, great, keep, or, donjon, usually, square, and, without, arrowslits, and, the, shape, would, have, been, dictated, by, the, lay, of, the, land, the, result, was, often, irregular, or, curvilinear, structures, the, design, of, castles, was, not, uniform, but, these, were, features, that, could, be, found, in, a, typical, castle, in, the, mid, 12th, century, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, or, the, early, 13th, century, a, newly, constructed, castle, could, be, expected, to, be, polygonal, in, shape, with, towers, at, the, corners, to, provide, enfilading, fire, for, the, walls, the, towers, would, have, protruded, from, the, walls, and, featured, arrowslits, on, each, level, to, allow, archers, to, target, anyone, nearing, or, at, the, curtain, wall, these, later, castles, did, not, always, have, a, keep, but, this, may, have, been, because, the, more, complex, design, of, the, castle, as, a, whole, drove, up, costs, and, the, keep, was, sacrificed, to, save, money, the, larger, towers, provided, space, for, habitation, to, make, up, for, the, loss, of, the, donjon, where, keeps, did, exist, they, were, no, longer, square, but, polygonal, or, cylindrical, gateways, were, more, strongly, defended, with, the, entrance, to, the, castle, usually, between, two, half, round, towers, which, were, connected, by, a, passage, above, the, gateway, although, there, was, great, variety, in, the, styles, of, gateway, and, entrances, and, one, or, more, portcullis, a, peculiar, feature, of, muslim, castles, in, the, iberian, peninsula, was, the, use, of, detached, towers, called, albarrana, towers, around, the, perimeter, as, can, be, seen, at, the, alcazaba, of, badajoz, probably, developed, in, the, 12th, century, the, towers, provided, flanking, fire, they, were, connected, to, the, castle, by, removable, wooden, bridges, so, if, the, towers, were, captured, the, rest, of, the, castle, was, not, accessible, when, seeking, to, explain, this, change, in, the, complexity, and, style, of, castles, antiquarians, found, their, answer, in, the, crusades, it, seemed, that, the, crusaders, had, learned, much, about, fortification, from, their, conflicts, with, the, saracens, and, exposure, to, byzantine, architecture, there, were, legends, such, as, that, of, lalys, an, architect, from, palestine, who, reputedly, went, to, wales, after, the, crusades, and, greatly, enhanced, the, castles, in, the, south, of, the, country, and, it, was, assumed, that, great, architects, such, as, james, of, saint, george, originated, in, the, east, in, the, mid, 20th, century, this, view, was, cast, into, doubt, legends, were, discredited, and, in, the, case, of, james, of, saint, george, it, was, proven, that, he, came, from, saint, georges, d, esp, ranche, in, france, if, the, innovations, in, fortification, had, derived, from, the, east, it, would, have, been, expected, for, their, influence, to, be, seen, from, 1100, onwards, immediately, after, the, christians, were, victorious, in, the, first, crusade, 1096, 1099, rather, than, nearly, 100, years, later, remains, of, roman, structures, in, western, europe, were, still, standing, in, many, places, some, of, which, had, flanking, round, towers, and, entrances, between, two, flanking, towers, the, castle, builders, of, western, europe, were, aware, of, and, influenced, by, roman, design, late, roman, coastal, forts, on, the, english, saxon, shore, were, reused, and, in, spain, the, wall, around, the, city, of, vila, imitated, roman, architecture, when, it, was, built, in, 1091, historian, smail, in, crusading, warfare, argued, that, the, case, for, the, influence, of, eastern, fortification, on, the, west, has, been, overstated, and, that, crusaders, of, the, 12th, century, in, fact, learned, very, little, about, scientific, design, from, byzantine, and, saracen, defences, a, well, sited, castle, that, made, use, of, natural, defences, and, had, strong, ditches, and, walls, had, no, need, for, a, scientific, design, an, example, of, this, approach, is, kerak, although, there, were, no, scientific, elements, to, its, design, it, was, almost, impregnable, and, in, 1187, saladin, chose, to, lay, siege, to, the, castle, and, starve, out, its, garrison, rather, than, risk, an, assault, during, the, late, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, in, what, is, now, south, central, turkey, the, hospitallers, teutonic, knights, and, templars, established, themselves, in, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, where, they, discovered, an, extensive, network, of, sophisticated, fortifications, which, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, architecture, of, crusader, castles, most, of, the, armenian, military, sites, in, cilicia, are, characterized, by, multiple, bailey, walls, laid, with, irregular, plans, to, follow, the, sinuosities, of, the, outcrops, rounded, and, especially, horseshoe, shaped, towers, finely, cut, often, rusticated, ashlar, facing, stones, with, intricate, poured, cores, concealed, postern, gates, and, complex, bent, entrances, with, slot, machicolations, embrasured, loopholes, for, archers, barrel, pointed, or, groined, vaults, over, undercrofts, gates, and, chapels, and, cisterns, with, elaborate, scarped, drains, civilian, settlement, are, often, found, in, the, immediate, proximity, of, these, fortifications, after, the, first, crusade, crusaders, who, did, not, return, to, their, homes, in, europe, helped, found, the, crusader, states, of, the, principality, of, antioch, the, county, of, edessa, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, and, the, county, of, tripoli, the, castles, they, founded, to, secure, their, acquisitions, were, designed, mostly, by, syrian, master, masons, their, design, was, very, similar, to, that, of, a, roman, fort, or, byzantine, tetrapyrgia, which, were, square, in, plan, and, had, square, towers, at, each, corner, that, did, not, project, much, beyond, the, curtain, wall, the, keep, of, these, crusader, castles, would, have, had, a, square, plan, and, generally, be, undecorated, while, castles, were, used, to, hold, a, site, and, control, movement, of, armies, in, the, holy, land, some, key, strategic, positions, were, left, unfortified, castle, architecture, in, the, east, became, more, complex, around, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, after, the, stalemate, of, the, third, crusade, 1189, 1192, both, christians, and, muslims, created, fortifications, and, the, character, of, each, was, different, saphadin, the, 13th, century, ruler, of, the, saracens, created, structures, with, large, rectangular, towers, that, influenced, muslim, architecture, and, were, copied, again, and, again, however, they, had, little, influence, on, crusader, castles, in, the, early, 13th, century, crusader, castles, were, mostly, built, by, military, orders, including, the, knights, hospitaller, knights, templar, and, teutonic, knights, the, orders, were, responsible, for, the, foundation, of, sites, such, as, krak, des, chevaliers, margat, and, belvoir, design, varied, not, just, between, orders, but, between, individual, castles, though, it, was, common, for, those, founded, in, this, period, to, have, concentric, defences, the, concept, which, originated, in, castles, such, as, krak, des, chevaliers, was, to, remove, the, reliance, on, a, central, strongpoint, and, to, emphasise, the, defence, of, the, curtain, walls, there, would, be, multiple, rings, of, defensive, walls, one, inside, the, other, with, the, inner, ring, rising, above, the, outer, so, that, its, field, of, fire, was, not, completely, obscured, if, assailants, made, it, past, the, first, line, of, defence, they, would, be, caught, in, the, killing, ground, between, the, inner, and, outer, walls, and, have, to, assault, the, second, wall, concentric, castles, were, widely, copied, across, europe, for, instance, when, edward, i, of, england, who, had, himself, been, on, crusade, built, castles, in, wales, in, the, late, 13th, century, four, of, the, eight, he, founded, had, a, concentric, design, not, all, the, features, of, the, crusader, castles, from, the, 13th, century, were, emulated, in, europe, for, instance, it, was, common, in, crusader, castles, to, have, the, main, gate, in, the, side, of, a, tower, and, for, there, to, be, two, turns, in, the, passageway, lengthening, the, time, it, took, for, someone, to, reach, the, outer, enclosure, it, is, rare, for, this, bent, entrance, to, be, found, in, europe, one, of, the, effects, of, the, livonian, crusade, in, the, baltic, was, the, introduction, of, stone, and, brick, fortifications, although, there, were, hundreds, of, wooden, castles, in, prussia, and, livonia, the, use, of, bricks, and, mortar, was, unknown, in, the, region, before, the, crusaders, until, the, 13th, century, and, start, of, the, 14th, centuries, their, design, was, heterogeneous, however, this, period, saw, the, emergence, of, a, standard, plan, in, the, region, a, square, plan, with, four, wings, around, a, central, courtyard, it, was, common, for, castles, in, the, east, to, have, arrowslits, in, the, curtain, wall, at, multiple, levels, contemporary, builders, in, europe, were, wary, of, this, as, they, believed, it, weakened, the, wall, arrowslits, did, not, compromise, the, wall, s, strength, but, it, was, not, until, edward, i, s, programme, of, castle, building, that, they, were, widely, adopted, in, europe, the, crusades, also, led, to, the, introduction, of, machicolations, into, western, architecture, until, the, 13th, century, the, tops, of, towers, had, been, surrounded, by, wooden, galleries, allowing, defenders, to, drop, objects, on, assailants, below, although, machicolations, performed, the, same, purpose, as, the, wooden, galleries, they, were, probably, an, eastern, invention, rather, than, an, evolution, of, the, wooden, form, machicolations, were, used, in, the, east, long, before, the, arrival, of, the, crusaders, and, perhaps, as, early, as, the, first, half, of, the, 8th, century, in, syria, the, greatest, period, of, castle, building, in, spain, was, in, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, and, they, were, most, commonly, found, in, the, disputed, borders, between, christian, and, muslim, lands, conflict, and, interaction, between, the, two, groups, led, to, an, exchange, of, architectural, ideas, and, spanish, christians, adopted, the, use, of, detached, towers, the, spanish, reconquista, driving, the, muslims, out, of, the, iberian, peninsula, was, complete, in, 1492, although, france, has, been, described, as, the, heartland, of, medieval, architecture, the, english, were, at, the, forefront, of, castle, architecture, in, the, 12th, century, french, historian, fran, ois, gebelin, wrote, the, great, revival, in, military, architecture, was, led, as, one, would, naturally, expect, by, the, powerful, kings, and, princes, of, the, time, by, the, sons, of, william, the, conqueror, and, their, descendants, the, plantagenets, when, they, became, dukes, of, normandy, these, were, the, men, who, built, all, the, most, typical, twelfth, century, fortified, castles, remaining, today, despite, this, by, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, century, the, rate, of, castle, construction, in, england, and, wales, went, into, decline, the, new, castles, were, generally, of, a, lighter, build, than, earlier, structures, and, presented, few, innovations, although, strong, sites, were, still, created, such, as, that, of, raglan, in, wales, at, the, same, time, french, castle, architecture, came, to, the, fore, and, led, the, way, in, the, field, of, medieval, fortifications, across, europe, particularly, the, baltic, germany, and, scotland, castles, were, built, well, into, the, 16th, century, artillery, powered, by, gunpowder, was, introduced, to, europe, in, the, 1320s, and, spread, quickly, handguns, which, were, initially, unpredictable, and, inaccurate, weapons, were, not, recorded, until, the, 1380s, castles, were, adapted, to, allow, small, artillery, pieces, averaging, between, 19, 6, and, 22, kg, 43, and, 49, lb, to, fire, from, towers, these, guns, were, too, heavy, for, a, man, to, carry, and, fire, but, if, he, supported, the, butt, end, and, rested, the, muzzle, on, the, edge, of, the, gun, port, he, could, fire, the, weapon, the, gun, ports, developed, in, this, period, show, a, unique, feature, that, of, a, horizontal, timber, across, the, opening, a, hook, on, the, end, of, the, gun, could, be, latched, over, the, timber, so, the, gunner, did, not, have, to, take, the, full, recoil, of, the, weapon, this, adaptation, is, found, across, europe, and, although, the, timber, rarely, survives, there, is, an, intact, example, at, castle, doornenburg, in, the, netherlands, gunports, were, keyhole, shaped, with, a, circular, hole, at, the, bottom, for, the, weapon, and, a, narrow, slit, on, top, to, allow, the, gunner, to, aim, this, form, is, very, common, in, castles, adapted, for, guns, found, in, egypt, italy, scotland, and, spain, and, elsewhere, in, between, other, types, of, port, though, less, common, were, horizontal, slits, allowing, only, lateral, movement, and, large, square, openings, which, allowed, greater, movement, the, use, of, guns, for, defence, gave, rise, to, artillery, castles, such, as, that, of, ch, teau, de, ham, in, france, defences, against, guns, were, not, developed, until, a, later, stage, ham, is, an, example, of, the, trend, for, new, castles, to, dispense, with, earlier, features, such, as, machicolations, tall, towers, and, crenellations, bigger, guns, were, developed, and, in, the, 15th, century, became, an, alternative, to, siege, engines, such, as, the, trebuchet, the, benefits, of, large, guns, over, trebuchets, the, most, effective, siege, engine, of, the, middle, ages, before, the, advent, of, gunpowder, were, those, of, a, greater, range, and, power, in, an, effort, to, make, them, more, effective, guns, were, made, ever, bigger, although, this, hampered, their, ability, to, reach, remote, castles, by, the, 1450s, guns, were, the, preferred, siege, weapon, and, their, effectiveness, was, demonstrated, by, mehmed, ii, at, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, response, towards, more, effective, cannons, was, to, build, thicker, walls, and, to, prefer, round, towers, as, the, curving, sides, were, more, likely, to, deflect, a, shot, than, a, flat, surface, while, this, sufficed, for, new, castles, pre, existing, structures, had, to, find, a, way, to, cope, with, being, battered, by, cannon, an, earthen, bank, could, be, piled, behind, a, castle, s, curtain, wall, to, absorb, some, of, the, shock, of, impact, often, castles, constructed, before, the, age, of, gunpowder, were, incapable, of, using, guns, as, their, wall, walks, were, too, narrow, a, solution, to, this, was, to, pull, down, the, top, of, a, tower, and, to, fill, the, lower, part, with, the, rubble, to, provide, a, surface, for, the, guns, to, fire, from, lowering, the, defences, in, this, way, had, the, effect, of, making, them, easier, to, scale, with, ladders, a, more, popular, alternative, defence, which, avoided, damaging, the, castle, was, to, establish, bulwarks, beyond, the, castle, s, defences, these, could, be, built, from, earth, or, stone, and, were, used, to, mount, weapons, around, 1500, the, innovation, of, the, angled, bastion, was, developed, in, italy, with, developments, such, as, these, italy, pioneered, permanent, artillery, fortifications, which, took, over, from, the, defensive, role, of, castles, from, this, evolved, star, forts, also, known, as, trace, italienne, the, elite, responsible, for, castle, construction, had, to, choose, between, the, new, type, that, could, withstand, cannon, fire, and, the, earlier, more, elaborate, style, the, first, was, ugly, and, uncomfortable, and, the, latter, was, less, secure, although, it, did, offer, greater, aesthetic, appeal, and, value, as, a, status, symbol, the, second, choice, proved, to, be, more, popular, as, it, became, apparent, that, there, was, little, point, in, trying, to, make, the, site, genuinely, defensible, in, the, face, of, cannon, for, a, variety, of, reasons, not, least, of, which, is, that, many, castles, have, no, recorded, history, there, is, no, firm, number, of, castles, built, in, the, medieval, period, however, it, has, been, estimated, that, between, 75, 000, and, 100, 000, were, built, in, western, europe, of, these, around, 1, 700, were, in, england, and, wales, and, around, 14, 000, in, german, speaking, areas, some, true, castles, were, built, in, the, americas, by, the, spanish, and, french, colonies, the, first, stage, of, spanish, fort, construction, has, been, termed, the, castle, period, which, lasted, from, 1492, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, starting, with, fortaleza, ozama, these, castles, were, essentially, european, medieval, castles, transposed, to, america, among, other, defensive, structures, including, forts, and, citadels, castles, were, also, built, in, new, france, towards, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, in, montreal, the, artillery, was, not, as, developed, as, on, the, battle, fields, of, europe, some, of, the, region, s, outlying, forts, were, built, like, the, fortified, manor, houses, of, france, fort, longueuil, built, from, 1695, to, 1698, by, a, baronial, family, has, been, described, as, the, most, medieval, looking, fort, built, in, canada, the, manor, house, and, stables, were, within, a, fortified, bailey, with, a, tall, round, turret, in, each, corner, the, most, substantial, castle, like, fort, near, montr, al, was, fort, senneville, built, in, 1692, with, square, towers, connected, by, thick, stone, walls, as, well, as, a, fortified, windmill, stone, forts, such, as, these, served, as, defensive, residences, as, well, as, imposing, structures, to, prevent, iroquois, incursions, although, castle, construction, faded, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, castles, did, not, necessarily, all, fall, out, of, use, some, retained, a, role, in, local, administration, and, became, law, courts, while, others, are, still, handed, down, in, aristocratic, families, as, hereditary, seats, a, particularly, famous, example, of, this, is, windsor, castle, in, england, which, was, founded, in, the, 11th, century, and, is, home, to, the, monarch, of, the, united, kingdom, in, other, cases, they, still, had, a, role, in, defence, tower, houses, which, are, closely, related, to, castles, and, include, pele, towers, were, defended, towers, that, were, permanent, residences, built, in, the, 14th, to, 17th, centuries, especially, common, in, ireland, and, scotland, they, could, be, up, to, five, storeys, high, and, succeeded, common, enclosure, castles, and, were, built, by, a, greater, social, range, of, people, while, unlikely, to, provide, as, much, protection, as, a, more, complex, castle, they, offered, security, against, raiders, and, other, small, threats, according, to, archaeologists, oliver, creighton, and, robert, higham, the, great, country, houses, of, the, seventeenth, to, twentieth, centuries, were, in, a, social, sense, the, castles, of, their, day, though, there, was, a, trend, for, the, elite, to, move, from, castles, into, country, houses, in, the, 17th, century, castles, were, not, completely, useless, in, later, conflicts, such, as, the, english, civil, war, 1641, 1651, many, castles, were, refortified, although, subsequently, slighted, to, prevent, them, from, being, used, again, some, country, residences, which, were, not, meant, to, be, fortified, were, given, a, castle, appearance, to, scare, away, potential, invaders, such, as, adding, turrets, and, using, small, windows, an, example, of, this, is, the, 16th, century, bubaqra, castle, in, bubaqra, malta, which, was, modified, in, the, 18th, century, revival, or, mock, castles, became, popular, as, a, manifestation, of, a, romantic, interest, in, the, middle, ages, and, chivalry, and, as, part, of, the, broader, gothic, revival, in, architecture, examples, of, these, castles, include, chapultepec, in, mexico, neuschwanstein, in, germany, and, edwin, lutyens, castle, drogo, 1911, 1930, the, last, flicker, of, this, movement, in, the, british, isles, while, churches, and, cathedrals, in, a, gothic, style, could, faithfully, imitate, medieval, examples, new, country, houses, built, in, a, castle, style, differed, internally, from, their, medieval, predecessors, this, was, because, to, be, faithful, to, medieval, design, would, have, left, the, houses, cold, and, dark, by, contemporary, standards, artificial, ruins, built, to, resemble, remnants, of, historic, edifices, were, also, a, hallmark, of, the, period, they, were, usually, built, as, centre, pieces, in, aristocratic, planned, landscapes, follies, were, similar, although, they, differed, from, artificial, ruins, in, that, they, were, not, part, of, a, planned, landscape, but, rather, seemed, to, have, no, reason, for, being, built, both, drew, on, elements, of, castle, architecture, such, as, castellation, and, towers, but, served, no, military, purpose, and, were, solely, for, display, a, toy, castle, is, used, as, a, common, children, attraction, in, playing, fields, and, fun, parks, such, as, the, castle, of, the, playmobil, funpark, in, al, far, malta, once, the, site, of, a, castle, had, been, selected, whether, a, strategic, position, or, one, intended, to, dominate, the, landscape, as, a, mark, of, power, the, building, material, had, to, be, selected, an, earth, and, timber, castle, was, cheaper, and, easier, to, erect, than, one, built, from, stone, the, costs, involved, in, construction, are, not, well, recorded, and, most, surviving, records, relate, to, royal, castles, a, castle, with, earthen, ramparts, a, motte, timber, defences, and, buildings, could, have, been, constructed, by, an, unskilled, workforce, the, source, of, man, power, was, probably, from, the, local, lordship, and, the, tenants, would, already, have, the, necessary, skills, of, felling, trees, digging, and, working, timber, necessary, for, an, earth, and, timber, castle, possibly, coerced, into, working, for, their, lord, the, construction, of, an, earth, and, timber, castle, would, not, have, been, a, drain, on, a, client, s, funds, in, terms, of, time, it, has, been, estimated, that, an, average, sized, motte, 5, m, 16, ft, high, and, 15, m, 49, ft, wide, at, the, summit, would, have, taken, 50, people, about, 40, working, days, an, exceptionally, expensive, motte, and, bailey, was, that, of, clones, in, ireland, built, in, 1211, for, uk, 20, the, high, cost, relative, to, other, castles, of, its, type, was, because, labourers, had, to, be, imported, the, cost, of, building, a, castle, varied, according, to, factors, such, as, their, complexity, and, transport, costs, for, material, it, is, certain, that, stone, castles, cost, a, great, deal, more, than, those, built, from, earth, and, timber, even, a, very, small, tower, such, as, peveril, castle, would, have, cost, around, uk, 200, in, the, middle, were, castles, such, as, orford, which, was, built, in, the, late, 12th, century, for, uk, 1, 400, and, at, the, upper, end, were, those, such, as, dover, which, cost, about, uk, 7, 000, between, 1181, and, 1191, spending, on, the, scale, of, the, vast, castles, such, as, ch, teau, gaillard, an, estimated, uk, 15, 000, to, uk, 20, 000, between, 1196, and, 1198, was, easily, supported, by, the, crown, but, for, lords, of, smaller, areas, castle, building, was, a, very, serious, and, costly, undertaking, it, was, usual, for, a, stone, castle, to, take, the, best, part, of, a, decade, to, finish, the, cost, of, a, large, castle, built, over, this, time, anywhere, from, uk, 1, 000, to, uk, 10, 000, would, take, the, income, from, several, manors, severely, impacting, a, lord, s, finances, costs, in, the, late, 13th, century, were, of, a, similar, order, with, castles, such, as, beaumaris, and, rhuddlan, costing, uk, 14, 500, and, uk, 9, 000, respectively, edward, i, s, campaign, of, castle, building, in, wales, cost, uk, 80, 000, between, 1277, and, 1304, and, uk, 95, 000, between, 1277, and, 1329, renowned, designer, master, james, of, saint, george,

of, material, of, which, there, will, have, to, be, a, great, quantity, the, men, s, pay, has, been, and, still, is, very, much, in, arrears, and, we, are, having, the, greatest, difficulty, in, keeping, them, because, they, have, simply, nothing, to, live, on, not, only, were, stone, castles, expensive, to, build, in, the, first, place, but, their, maintenance, was, a, constant, drain, they, contained, a, lot, of, timber, which, was, often, unseasoned, and, as, a, result, needed, careful, upkeep, for, example, it, is, documented, that, in, the, late, 12th, century, repairs, at, castles, such, as, exeter, and, gloucester, cost, between, uk, 20, and, uk, 50, annually, medieval, machines, and, inventions, such, as, the, treadwheel, crane, became, indispensable, during, construction, and, techniques, of, building, wooden, scaffolding, were, improved, upon, from, antiquity, when, building, in, stone, a, prominent, concern, of, medieval, builders, was, to, have, quarries, close, at, hand, there, are, examples, of, some, castles, where, stone, was, quarried, on, site, such, as, chinon, ch, teau, de, coucy, and, ch, teau, gaillard, when, it, was, built, in, 992, in, france, the, stone, tower, at, ch, teau, de, langeais, was, 16, metres, 52, ft, high, 17, 5, metres, 57, ft, wide, and, 10, metres, 33, ft, long, with, walls, averaging, 1, 5, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, the, walls, contain, 1, 200, cubic, metres, 42, 000, cu, ft, of, stone, and, have, a, total, surface, both, inside, and, out, of, 1, 600, square, metres, 17, 000, sq, ft, the, tower, is, estimated, to, have, taken, 83, 000, average, working, days, to, complete, most, of, which, was, unskilled, labour, many, countries, had, both, timber, and, stone, castles, however, denmark, had, few, quarries, and, as, a, result, most, of, its, castles, are, earth, and, timber, affairs, or, later, on, built, from, brick, brick, built, structures, were, not, necessarily, weaker, than, their, stone, built, counterparts, brick, castles, are, less, common, in, england, than, stone, or, earth, and, timber, constructions, and, often, it, was, chosen, for, its, aesthetic, appeal, or, because, it, was, fashionable, encouraged, by, the, brick, architecture, of, the, low, countries, for, example, when, tattershall, castle, in, england, was, built, between, 1430, and, 1450, there, was, plenty, of, stone, available, nearby, but, the, owner, lord, cromwell, chose, to, use, brick, about, 700, 000, bricks, were, used, to, build, the, castle, which, has, been, described, as, the, finest, piece, of, medieval, brick, work, in, england, most, spanish, castles, were, built, from, stone, whereas, castles, in, eastern, europe, were, usually, of, timber, construction, on, the, construction, of, the, castle, of, safed, written, in, the, early, 1260s, describes, the, construction, of, a, new, castle, at, safed, it, is, one, of, the, fullest, medieval, accounts, of, a, castle, s, construction, due, to, the, lord, s, presence, in, a, castle, it, was, a, centre, of, administration, from, where, he, controlled, his, lands, he, relied, on, the, support, of, those, below, him, as, without, the, support, of, his, more, powerful, tenants, a, lord, could, expect, his, power, to, be, undermined, successful, lords, regularly, held, court, with, those, immediately, below, them, on, the, social, scale, but, absentees, could, expect, to, find, their, influence, weakened, larger, lordships, could, be, vast, and, it, would, be, impractical, for, a, lord, to, visit, all, his, properties, regularly, so, deputies, were, appointed, this, especially, applied, to, royalty, who, sometimes, owned, land, in, different, countries, to, allow, the, lord, to, concentrate, on, his, duties, regarding, administration, he, had, a, household, of, servants, to, take, care, of, chores, such, as, providing, food, the, household, was, run, by, a, chamberlain, while, a, treasurer, took, care, of, the, estate, s, written, records, royal, households, took, essentially, the, same, form, as, baronial, households, although, on, a, much, larger, scale, and, the, positions, were, more, prestigious, an, important, role, of, the, household, servants, was, the, preparation, of, food, the, castle, kitchens, would, have, been, a, busy, place, when, the, castle, was, occupied, called, on, to, provide, large, meals, without, the, presence, of, a, lord, s, household, usually, because, he, was, staying, elsewhere, a, castle, would, have, been, a, quiet, place, with, few, residents, focused, on, maintaining, the, castle, as, social, centres, castles, were, important, places, for, display, builders, took, the, opportunity, to, draw, on, symbolism, through, the, use, of, motifs, to, evoke, a, sense, of, chivalry, that, was, aspired, to, in, the, middle, ages, amongst, the, elite, later, structures, of, the, romantic, revival, would, draw, on, elements, of, castle, architecture, such, as, battlements, for, the, same, purpose, castles, have, been, compared, with, cathedrals, as, objects, of, architectural, pride, and, some, castles, incorporated, gardens, as, ornamental, features, the, right, to, crenellate, when, granted, by, a, monarch, though, it, was, not, always, necessary, was, important, not, just, as, it, allowed, a, lord, to, defend, his, property, but, because, crenellations, and, other, accoutrements, associated, with, castles, were, prestigious, through, their, use, by, the, elite, licences, to, crenellate, were, also, proof, of, a, relationship, with, or, favour, from, the, monarch, who, was, the, one, responsible, for, granting, permission, the, castle, as, a, large, and, imposing, architectural, structure, in, the, landscape, would, have, evoked, emotions, and, attachments, and, created, a, legacy, for, those, who, built, it, worked, in, it, and, lived, in, and, around, it, as, well, as, those, who, simply, passed, it, on, a, daily, basis, thorstad, 2019, p, 210, courtly, love, was, the, eroticisation, of, love, between, the, nobility, emphasis, was, placed, on, restraint, between, lovers, though, sometimes, expressed, through, chivalric, events, such, as, tournaments, where, knights, would, fight, wearing, a, token, from, their, lady, it, could, also, be, private, and, conducted, in, secret, the, legend, of, tristan, and, iseult, is, one, example, of, stories, of, courtly, love, told, in, the, middle, ages, it, was, an, ideal, of, love, between, two, people, not, married, to, each, other, although, the, man, might, be, married, to, someone, else, it, was, not, uncommon, or, ignoble, for, a, lord, to, be, adulterous, henry, i, of, england, had, over, 20, bastards, for, instance, but, for, a, lady, to, be, promiscuous, was, seen, as, dishonourable, the, purpose, of, marriage, between, the, medieval, elites, was, to, secure, land, girls, were, married, in, their, teens, but, boys, did, not, marry, until, they, came, of, age, there, is, a, popular, conception, that, women, played, a, peripheral, role, in, the, medieval, castle, household, and, that, it, was, dominated, by, the, lord, himself, this, derives, from, the, image, of, the, castle, as, a, martial, institution, but, most, castles, in, england, france, ireland, and, scotland, were, never, involved, in, conflicts, or, sieges, so, the, domestic, life, is, a, neglected, facet, the, lady, was, given, a, dower, of, her, husband, s, estates, usually, about, a, third, which, was, hers, for, life, and, her, husband, would, inherit, on, her, death, it, was, her, duty, to, administer, them, directly, as, the, lord, administered, his, own, land, despite, generally, being, excluded, from, military, service, a, woman, could, be, in, charge, of, a, castle, either, on, behalf, of, her, husband, or, if, she, was, widowed, because, of, their, influence, within, the, medieval, household, women, influenced, construction, and, design, sometimes, through, direct, patronage, historian, charles, coulson, emphasises, the, role, of, women, in, applying, a, refined, aristocratic, taste, to, castles, due, to, their, long, term, residence, the, positioning, of, castles, was, influenced, by, the, available, terrain, whereas, hill, castles, such, as, marksburg, were, common, in, germany, where, 66, per, cent, of, all, known, medieval, were, highland, area, while, 34, per, cent, were, on, low, lying, land, they, formed, a, minority, of, sites, in, england, because, of, the, range, of, functions, they, had, to, fulfil, castles, were, built, in, a, variety, of, locations, multiple, factors, were, considered, when, choosing, a, site, balancing, between, the, need, for, a, defendable, position, with, other, considerations, such, as, proximity, to, resources, for, instance, many, castles, are, located, near, roman, roads, which, remained, important, transport, routes, in, the, middle, ages, or, could, lead, to, the, alteration, or, creation, of, new, road, systems, in, the, area, where, available, it, was, common, to, exploit, pre, existing, defences, such, as, building, with, a, roman, fort, or, the, ramparts, of, an, iron, age, hillfort, a, prominent, site, that, overlooked, the, surrounding, area, and, offered, some, natural, defences, may, also, have, been, chosen, because, its, visibility, made, it, a, symbol, of, power, urban, castles, were, particularly, important, in, controlling, centres, of, population, and, production, especially, with, an, invading, force, for, instance, in, the, aftermath, of, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, the, 11th, century, the, majority, of, royal, castles, were, built, in, or, near, towns, as, castles, were, not, simply, military, buildings, but, centres, of, administration, and, symbols, of, power, they, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, surrounding, landscape, placed, by, a, frequently, used, road, or, river, the, toll, castle, ensured, that, a, lord, would, get, his, due, toll, money, from, merchants, rural, castles, were, often, associated, with, mills, and, field, systems, due, to, their, role, in, managing, the, lord, s, estate, which, gave, them, greater, influence, over, resources, others, were, adjacent, to, or, in, royal, forests, or, deer, parks, and, were, important, in, their, upkeep, fish, ponds, were, a, luxury, of, the, lordly, elite, and, many, were, found, next, to, castles, not, only, were, they, practical, in, that, they, ensured, a, water, supply, and, fresh, fish, but, they, were, a, status, symbol, as, they, were, expensive, to, build, and, maintain, although, sometimes, the, construction, of, a, castle, led, to, the, destruction, of, a, village, such, as, at, eaton, socon, in, england, it, was, more, common, for, the, villages, nearby, to, have, grown, as, a, result, of, the, presence, of, a, castle, sometimes, planned, towns, or, villages, were, created, around, a, castle, the, benefits, of, castle, building, on, settlements, was, not, confined, to, europe, when, the, 13th, century, safad, castle, was, founded, in, galilee, in, the, holy, land, the, 260, villages, benefitted, from, the, inhabitants, newfound, ability, to, move, freely, when, built, a, castle, could, result, in, the, restructuring, of, the, local, landscape, with, roads, moved, for, the, convenience, of, the, lord, settlements, could, also, grow, naturally, around, a, castle, rather, than, being, planned, due, to, the, benefits, of, proximity, to, an, economic, centre, in, a, rural, landscape, and, the, safety, given, by, the, defences, not, all, such, settlements, survived, as, once, the, castle, lost, its, importance, perhaps, succeeded, by, a, manor, house, as, the, centre, of, administration, the, benefits, of, living, next, to, a, castle, vanished, and, the, settlement, depopulated, during, and, shortly, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, castles, were, inserted, into, important, pre, existing, towns, to, control, and, subdue, the, populace, they, were, usually, located, near, any, existing, town, defences, such, as, roman, walls, although, this, sometimes, resulted, in, the, demolition, of, structures, occupying, the, desired, site, in, lincoln, 166, houses, were, destroyed, to, clear, space, for, the, castle, and, in, york, agricultural, land, was, flooded, to, create, a, moat, for, the, castle, as, the, military, importance, of, urban, castles, waned, from, their, early, origins, they, became, more, important, as, centres, of, administration, and, their, financial, and, judicial, roles, when, the, normans, invaded, ireland, scotland, and, wales, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, settlement, in, those, countries, was, predominantly, non, urban, and, the, foundation, of, towns, was, often, linked, with, the, creation, of, a, castle, the, location, of, castles, in, relation, to, high, status, features, such, as, fish, ponds, was, a, statement, of, power, and, control, of, resources, also, often, found, near, a, castle, sometimes, within, its, defences, was, the, parish, church, this, signified, a, close, relationship, between, feudal, lords, and, the, church, one, of, the, most, important, institutions, of, medieval, society, even, elements, of, castle, architecture, that, have, usually, been, interpreted, as, military, could, be, used, for, display, the, water, features, of, kenilworth, castle, in, england, comprising, a, moat, and, several, satellite, ponds, forced, anyone, approaching, a, water, castle, entrance, to, take, a, very, indirect, route, walking, around, the, defences, before, the, final, approach, towards, the, gateway, another, example, is, that, of, the, 14th, century, bodiam, castle, also, in, england, although, it, appears, to, be, a, state, of, the, art, advanced, castle, it, is, in, a, site, of, little, strategic, importance, and, the, moat, was, shallow, and, more, likely, intended, to, make, the, site, appear, impressive, than, as, a, defence, against, mining, the, approach, was, long, and, took, the, viewer, around, the, castle, ensuring, they, got, a, good, look, before, entering, moreover, the, gunports, were, impractical, and, unlikely, to, have, been, effective, as, a, static, structure, castles, could, often, be, avoided, their, immediate, area, of, influence, was, about, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, and, their, weapons, had, a, short, range, even, early, in, the, age, of, artillery, however, leaving, an, enemy, behind, would, allow, them, to, interfere, with, communications, and, make, raids, garrisons, were, expensive, and, as, a, result, often, small, unless, the, castle, was, important, cost, also, meant, that, in, peacetime, garrisons, were, smaller, and, small, castles, were, manned, by, perhaps, a, couple, of, watchmen, and, gate, guards, even, in, war, garrisons, were, not, necessarily, large, as, too, many, people, in, a, defending, force, would, strain, supplies, and, impair, the, castle, s, ability, to, withstand, a, long, siege, in, 1403, a, force, of, 37, archers, successfully, defended, caernarfon, castle, against, two, assaults, by, owain, glynd, r, s, allies, during, a, long, siege, demonstrating, that, a, small, force, could, be, effective, early, on, manning, a, castle, was, a, feudal, duty, of, vassals, to, their, magnates, and, magnates, to, their, kings, however, this, was, later, replaced, with, paid, forces, a, garrison, was, usually, commanded, by, a, constable, whose, peacetime, role, would, have, been, looking, after, the, castle, in, the, owner, s, absence, under, him, would, have, been, knights, who, by, benefit, of, their, military, training, would, have, acted, as, a, type, of, officer, class, below, them, were, archers, and, bowmen, whose, role, was, to, prevent, the, enemy, reaching, the, walls, as, can, be, seen, by, the, positioning, of, arrowslits, if, it, was, necessary, to, seize, control, of, a, castle, an, army, could, either, launch, an, assault, or, lay, siege, it, was, more, efficient, to, starve, the, garrison, out, than, to, assault, it, particularly, for, the, most, heavily, defended, sites, without, relief, from, an, external, source, the, defenders, would, eventually, submit, sieges, could, last, weeks, months, and, in, rare, cases, years, if, the, supplies, of, food, and, water, were, plentiful, a, long, siege, could, slow, down, the, army, allowing, help, to, come, or, for, the, enemy, to, prepare, a, larger, force, for, later, such, an, approach, was, not, confined, to, castles, but, was, also, applied, to, the, fortified, towns, of, the, day, on, occasion, siege, castles, would, be, built, to, defend, the, besiegers, from, a, sudden, sally, and, would, have, been, abandoned, after, the, siege, ended, one, way, or, another, if, forced, to, assault, a, castle, there, were, many, options, available, to, the, attackers, for, wooden, structures, such, as, early, motte, and, baileys, fire, was, a, real, threat, and, attempts, would, be, made, to, set, them, alight, as, can, be, seen, in, the, bayeux, tapestry, projectile, weapons, had, been, used, since, antiquity, and, the, mangonel, and, petraria, from, eastern, and, roman, origins, respectively, were, the, main, two, that, were, used, into, the, middle, ages, the, trebuchet, which, probably, evolved, from, the, petraria, in, the, 13th, century, was, the, most, effective, siege, weapon, before, the, development, of, cannons, these, weapons, were, vulnerable, to, fire, from, the, castle, as, they, had, a, short, range, and, were, large, machines, conversely, weapons, such, as, trebuchets, could, be, fired, from, within, the, castle, due, to, the, high, trajectory, of, its, projectile, and, would, be, protected, from, direct, fire, by, the, curtain, walls, ballistas, or, springalds, were, siege, engines, that, worked, on, the, same, principles, as, crossbows, with, their, origins, in, ancient, greece, tension, was, used, to, project, a, bolt, or, javelin, missiles, fired, from, these, engines, had, a, lower, trajectory, than, trebuchets, or, mangonels, and, were, more, accurate, they, were, more, commonly, used, against, the, garrison, rather, than, the, buildings, of, a, castle, eventually, cannons, developed, to, the, point, where, they, were, more, powerful, and, had, a, greater, range, than, the, trebuchet, and, became, the, main, weapon, in, siege, warfare, walls, could, be, undermined, by, a, sap, a, mine, leading, to, the, wall, would, be, dug, and, once, the, target, had, been, reached, the, wooden, supports, preventing, the, tunnel, from, collapsing, would, be, burned, it, would, cave, in, and, bring, down, the, structure, above, building, a, castle, on, a, rock, outcrop, or, surrounding, it, with, a, wide, deep, moat, helped, prevent, this, a, counter, mine, could, be, dug, towards, the, besiegers, tunnel, assuming, the, two, converged, this, would, result, in, underground, hand, to, hand, combat, mining, was, so, effective, that, during, the, siege, of, margat, in, 1285, when, the, garrison, were, informed, a, sap, was, being, dug, they, surrendered, battering, rams, were, also, used, usually, in, the, form, of, a, tree, trunk, given, an, iron, cap, they, were, used, to, force, open, the, castle, gates, although, they, were, sometimes, used, against, walls, with, less, effect, as, an, alternative, to, the, time, consuming, task, of, creating, a, breach, an, escalade, could, be, attempted, to, capture, the, walls, with, fighting, along, the, walkways, behind, the, battlements, in, this, instance, attackers, would, be, vulnerable, to, arrow, fire, a, safer, option, for, those, assaulting, a, castle, was, to, use, a, siege, tower, sometimes, called, a, belfry, once, ditches, around, a, castle, were, partially, filled, in, these, wooden, movable, towers, could, be, pushed, against, the, curtain, wall, as, well, as, offering, some, protection, for, those, inside, a, siege, tower, could, overlook, the, interior, of, a, castle, giving, bowmen, an, advantageous, position, from, which, to, unleash, missiles, castle, features, similar, structures
