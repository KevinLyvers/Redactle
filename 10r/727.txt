the, world, s, seas, and, oceans, each, year, they, handle, the, bulk, of, international, trade, cargo, ships, are, usually, specially, designed, for, the, task, often, being, equipped, with, cranes, and, other, mechanisms, to, load, and, unload, and, come, in, all, sizes, a, bulk, carrier, is, a, ship, used, to, transport, bulk, cargo, items, such, as, iron, ore, bauxite, coal, cement, grain, and, similar, cargo, bulk, carriers, can, be, recognized, by, large, box, like, hatches, on, deck, designed, to, slide, outboard, or, fold, fore, and, aft, to, enable, access, for, loading, or, discharging, cargo, the, dimensions, of, bulk, carriers, are, often, determined, by, the, ports, and, sea, routes, that, they, need, to, serve, and, by, the, maximum, width, of, the, panama, canal, most, lakes, are, too, small, to, accommodate, bulk, carriers, but, a, large, fleet, of, lake, freighters, has, been, plying, the, great, lakes, and, st, lawrence, seaway, of, north, america, for, over, a, century, a, container, ship, is, a, cargo, ship, that, carries, its, cargo, in, standardized, containers, in, a, technique, called, containerization, these, ships, are, a, common, means, of, commercial, intermodal, freight, transport, a, tanker, is, a, ship, designed, to, transport, liquids, in, bulk, tankers, can, range, in, size, from, several, hundred, tons, designed, to, serve, small, harbours, and, coastal, settlements, to, several, hundred, thousand, tons, with, these, being, designed, for, long, range, haulage, a, wide, range, of, products, are, carried, by, tankers, including, different, products, require, different, handling, and, transport, thus, special, types, of, tankers, have, been, built, such, as, chemical, tankers, oil, tankers, and, gas, carriers, among, oil, tankers, supertankers, were, designed, for, carrying, oil, around, the, horn, of, africa, from, the, middle, east, the, fso, knock, nevis, being, the, largest, vessel, in, the, world, a, ulcc, supertanker, formerly, known, as, jahre, viking, seawise, giant, it, has, a, deadweight, of, 565, 000, metric, tons, and, length, of, about, 458, meters, 1, 500, ft, the, use, of, such, large, ships, is, in, fact, very, unprofitable, due, to, the, inability, to, operate, them, at, full, cargo, capacity, hence, the, production, of, supertankers, has, currently, ceased, today, s, largest, oil, tankers, in, comparison, by, gross, tonnage, are, ti, europe, ti, asia, ti, oceania, which, are, the, largest, sailing, vessels, today, but, even, with, their, deadweight, of, 441, 585, metric, tons, sailing, as, vlcc, most, of, the, time, they, do, not, use, more, than, 70, of, their, total, capacity, apart, from, pipeline, transport, tankers, are, the, only, method, for, transporting, large, quantities, of, oil, although, such, tankers, have, caused, large, environmental, disasters, when, sinking, close, to, coastal, regions, causing, oil, spills, see, braer, erika, exxon, valdez, prestige, and, torrey, canyon, for, examples, of, tankers, that, have, been, involved, in, oil, spills, coastal, trading, vessels, are, smaller, ships, that, carry, any, category, of, cargo, along, coastal, rather, than, trans, oceanic, routes, coasters, are, shallow, hulled, ships, used, for, trade, between, locations, on, the, same, island, or, continent, their, shallow, hulls, allow, them, to, sail, over, reefs, and, other, submerged, navigation, hazards, whereas, ships, designed, for, blue, water, trade, usually, have, much, deeper, hulls, for, better, seakeeping, a, passenger, ship, is, a, ship, whose, primary, function, is, to, carry, passengers, the, category, does, not, include, cargo, vessels, which, have, accommodations, for, limited, numbers, of, passengers, such, as, the, formerly, ubiquitous, twelve, passenger, freighters, in, which, the, transport, of, passengers, is, secondary, to, the, carriage, of, freight, the, type, does, however, include, many, classes, of, ships, which, are, designed, to, transport, substantial, numbers, of, passengers, as, well, as, freight, indeed, until, recently, virtually, all, ocean, liners, were, able, to, transport, mail, package, freight, and, express, and, other, cargo, in, addition, to, passenger, luggage, and, were, equipped, with, cargo, holds, and, derricks, kingposts, or, other, cargo, handling, gear, for, that, purpose, modern, cruiseferries, have, car, decks, for, lorries, as, well, as, the, passengers, cars, only, in, more, recent, ocean, liners, and, in, virtually, all, cruise, ships, has, this, cargo, capacity, been, removed, a, ferry, is, a, boat, or, ship, carrying, passengers, and, sometimes, their, vehicles, ferries, are, also, used, to, transport, freight, in, lorries, and, sometimes, unpowered, freight, containers, and, even, railroad, cars, in, the, case, of, a, train, ferry
