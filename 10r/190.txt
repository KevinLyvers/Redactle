an, oil, well, is, a, drillhole, boring, in, earth, that, is, designed, to, bring, petroleum, oil, hydrocarbons, to, the, surface, usually, some, natural, gas, is, released, as, associated, petroleum, gas, along, with, the, oil, a, well, that, is, designed, to, produce, only, gas, may, be, termed, a, gas, well, wells, are, created, by, drilling, down, into, an, oil, or, gas, reserve, and, if, necessary, equipped, with, extraction, devices, such, as, pumpjacks, creating, the, wells, can, be, an, expensive, process, costing, at, least, hundreds, of, thousands, of, dollars, and, costing, much, more, when, in, difficult, to, access, locations, e, g, offshore, the, process, of, modern, drilling, for, wells, first, started, in, the, 19th, century, but, was, made, more, efficient, with, advances, to, oil, drilling, rigs, and, technology, during, the, 20th, century, wells, are, frequently, sold, or, exchanged, between, different, oil, and, gas, companies, as, an, asset, in, large, part, because, during, falls, in, the, price, of, oil, and, gas, a, well, may, be, unproductive, but, if, prices, rise, even, low, production, wells, may, be, economically, valuable, moreover, new, methods, such, as, hydraulic, fracturing, a, process, of, injecting, gas, or, liquid, to, force, more, oil, or, natural, gas, production, have, made, some, wells, viable, however, peak, oil, and, climate, policy, surrounding, fossil, fuels, have, made, fewer, of, these, wells, and, costly, techniques, viable, however, a, large, number, of, neglected, or, poorly, maintained, wellheads, is, a, large, environmental, issue, they, may, leak, methane, or, other, toxic, substances, into, local, air, water, and, soil, systems, this, pollution, often, becomes, worse, when, wells, are, abandoned, or, orphaned, i, e, where, wells, no, longer, economically, viable, are, no, longer, maintained, by, their, former, owners, a, 2020, estimate, by, reuters, suggested, that, there, were, at, least, 29, million, abandoned, wells, internationally, creating, a, significant, source, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, worsening, climate, change, the, earliest, known, oil, wells, were, drilled, in, china, in, 347, ce, these, wells, had, depths, of, up, to, about, 240, metres, 790, ft, and, were, drilled, using, bits, attached, to, bamboo, poles, the, oil, was, burned, to, evaporate, brine, producing, salt, by, the, 10th, century, extensive, bamboo, pipelines, connected, oil, wells, with, salt, springs, the, ancient, records, of, china, and, japan, are, said, to, contain, many, allusions, to, the, use, of, natural, gas, for, lighting, and, heating, petroleum, was, known, as, burning, water, in, japan, in, the, 7th, century, according, to, kasem, ajram, petroleum, was, distilled, by, the, persian, alchemist, muhammad, ibn, zakar, ya, r, zi, rhazes, in, the, 9th, century, producing, chemicals, such, as, kerosene, in, the, alembic, al, ambiq, and, which, was, mainly, used, for, kerosene, lamps, arab, and, persian, chemists, also, distilled, crude, oil, in, order, to, produce, flammable, products, for, military, purposes, through, islamic, spain, distillation, became, available, in, western, europe, by, the, 12th, century, some, sources, claim, that, from, the, 9th, century, oil, fields, were, exploited, in, the, area, around, modern, baku, azerbaijan, to, produce, naphtha, for, the, petroleum, industry, these, places, were, described, by, marco, polo, in, the, 13th, century, who, described, the, output, of, those, oil, wells, as, hundreds, of, shiploads, when, marco, polo, in, 1264, visited, baku, on, the, shores, of, the, caspian, sea, he, saw, oil, being, collected, from, seeps, he, wrote, that, on, the, confines, toward, geirgine, there, is, a, fountain, from, which, oil, springs, in, great, abundance, in, as, much, as, a, hundred, shiploads, might, be, taken, from, it, at, one, time, in, 1846, baku, settlement, bibi, heybat, the, first, ever, well, was, drilled, with, percussion, tools, to, a, depth, of, 21, metres, 69, ft, for, oil, exploration, in, 1846, 1848, the, first, modern, oil, wells, were, drilled, on, the, absheron, peninsula, north, east, of, baku, by, russian, engineer, vasily, semyonov, applying, the, ideas, of, nikolay, voskoboynikov, ignacy, ukasiewicz, a, polish, pharmacist, and, petroleum, industry, pioneer, drilled, one, of, the, world, s, first, modern, oil, wells, in, 1854, in, polish, village, b, brka, krosno, county, who, in, 1856, built, one, of, the, world, s, first, oil, refineries, in, north, america, the, first, commercial, oil, well, entered, operation, in, oil, springs, ontario, in, 1858, while, the, first, offshore, oil, well, was, drilled, in, 1896, in, the, summerland, oil, field, on, the, california, coast, the, earliest, oil, wells, in, modern, times, were, drilled, percussively, by, repeatedly, raising, and, dropping, a, bit, on, the, bottom, of, a, cable, into, the, borehole, in, the, 20th, century, cable, tools, were, largely, replaced, with, rotary, drilling, which, could, drill, boreholes, to, much, greater, depths, and, in, less, time, the, record, depth, kola, borehole, used, a, mud, motor, while, drilling, to, achieve, a, depth, of, over, 12, 000, metres, 12, km, 39, 000, ft, 7, 5, mi, until, the, 1970s, most, oil, wells, were, essentially, vertical, although, lithological, variations, cause, most, wells, to, deviate, at, least, slightly, from, true, vertical, see, deviation, survey, however, modern, directional, drilling, technologies, allow, for, highly, deviated, wells, that, can, given, sufficient, depth, and, with, the, proper, tools, actually, become, horizontal, this, is, of, great, value, as, the, reservoir, rocks, that, contain, hydrocarbons, are, usually, horizontal, or, nearly, horizontal, a, horizontal, wellbore, placed, in, a, production, zone, has, more, surface, area, in, the, production, zone, than, a, vertical, well, resulting, in, a, higher, production, rate, the, use, of, deviated, and, horizontal, drilling, has, also, made, it, possible, to, reach, reservoirs, several, kilometers, or, miles, away, from, the, drilling, location, extended, reach, drilling, allowing, for, the, production, of, hydrocarbons, located, below, locations, that, are, difficult, to, place, a, drilling, rig, on, environmentally, sensitive, or, populated, the, target, the, endpoint, of, the, well, will, be, matched, with, a, surface, location, the, starting, point, of, the, well, and, a, trajectory, between, the, two, will, be, designed, there, are, many, considerations, to, take, into, account, when, designing, the, trajectory, such, as, the, clearance, from, any, nearby, wells, anti, collision, or, future, wellpaths, before, a, well, is, drilled, a, geologic, target, is, identified, by, a, geologist, or, geophysicist, to, meet, the, objectives, of, the, well, when, the, well, path, is, identified, a, team, of, geoscientists, and, engineers, will, develop, a, set, of, presumed, characteristics, of, the, subsurface, path, that, will, be, drilled, through, to, reach, the, target, these, properties, may, include, lithology, pore, pressure, fracture, gradient, wellbore, stability, porosity, and, permeability, these, assumptions, are, used, by, a, well, engineering, team, designing, the, casing, and, completion, programs, for, the, well, also, considered, in, the, detailed, planning, are, selection, of, the, drill, bits, bottom, hole, assembly, and, the, drilling, fluid, step, by, step, procedures, are, written, to, provide, guidelines, for, executing, the, well, in, a, safe, and, cost, efficient, manner, with, the, interplay, with, many, of, the, elements, in, a, well, s, design, trajectories, and, designs, often, go, through, several, iterations, before, the, plan, is, finalized, the, well, is, created, by, drilling, a, hole, 12, cm, to, 1, meter, 5, in, to, 40, in, in, diameter, into, the, earth, with, a, drilling, rig, that, rotates, a, drill, string, with, a, bit, attached, at, depths, during, the, process, sections, of, steel, pipe, casing, slightly, smaller, in, diameter, than, the, borehole, at, that, point, are, placed, in, the, hole, cement, slurry, will, be, pumped, down, the, inside, to, rise, in, the, annulus, between, the, borehole, and, the, outside, of, the, casing, the, casing, provides, structural, integrity, to, that, portion, of, the, newly, drilled, wellbore, in, addition, to, isolating, potentially, dangerous, high, pressure, zones, from, lower, pressure, ones, and, from, the, surface, with, these, zones, safely, isolated, and, the, formation, protected, by, the, casing, the, well, can, be, drilled, deeper, into, potentially, higher, pressure, or, more, unstable, formations, with, a, smaller, bit, and, then, cased, with, a, smaller, size, pipe, modern, wells, generally, have, two, to, as, many, as, five, sets, of, subsequently, smaller, hole, sizes, each, cemented, with, casing, this, process, is, all, facilitated, by, a, drilling, rig, which, contains, all, necessary, equipment, to, circulate, the, drilling, fluid, hoist, and, rotate, the, pipe, remove, cuttings, from, the, drilling, fluid, and, generate, on, site, power, for, these, operations, after, drilling, and, casing, the, well, it, must, be, completed, completion, is, the, process, in, which, the, well, is, prepared, to, produce, oil, or, gas, in, a, cased, hole, completion, small, perforations, are, made, in, the, portion, of, the, casing, across, the, production, zone, to, provide, a, path, for, the, oil, to, flow, from, the, surrounding, rock, into, the, production, tubing, in, open, hole, completion, often, a, sand, screen, or, gravel, pack, is, installed, in, the, last, drilled, but, uncased, reservoir, section, these, maintain, structural, integrity, of, the, wellbore, in, the, absence, of, casing, while, still, allowing, flow, from, the, reservoir, into, the, borehole, screens, also, control, the, migration, of, formation, sands, into, production, tubulars, which, can, lead, to, washouts, and, other, problems, particularly, from, unconsolidated, sand, formations, after, a, flow, path, is, made, acids, and, fracturing, fluids, may, be, pumped, into, the, well, to, fracture, clean, or, otherwise, prepare, and, stimulate, the, reservoir, rock, to, allow, optimal, production, of, hydrocarbons, into, the, wellbore, usually, the, area, above, the, producing, section, of, the, well, is, packed, off, inside, the, casing, and, connected, to, the, surface, via, a, smaller, diameter, pipe, called, tubing, this, arrangement, provides, a, redundant, barrier, to, leaks, of, hydrocarbons, as, well, as, allowing, damaged, sections, to, be, replaced, also, the, smaller, cross, sectional, area, of, the, tubing, gives, reservoir, fluids, an, increased, velocity, to, minimize, liquid, fallback, that, would, create, additional, back, pressure, and, shields, the, casing, from, corrosive, well, fluids, in, many, wells, the, natural, pressure, of, the, subsurface, reservoir, is, high, enough, for, the, oil, or, gas, to, flow, to, the, surface, however, this, is, not, always, the, case, especially, in, depleted, fields, where, the, pressures, have, been, lowered, by, other, producing, wells, or, in, low, permeability, oil, reservoirs, installing, a, smaller, diameter, tubing, may, be, enough, to, help, the, production, but, artificial, lift, methods, may, also, be, needed, common, solutions, include, surface, pump, jacks, downhole, hydraulic, pumps, or, gas, lift, assistance, many, new, systems, in, recent, years, have, been, introduced, for, well, completion, multiple, packer, systems, with, frac, ports, or, port, collars, in, an, all, in, one, system, have, cut, completion, costs, and, improved, production, especially, in, the, case, of, horizontal, wells, these, new, systems, allow, casing, to, run, into, the, lateral, zone, equipped, with, proper, packer, frac, port, placement, for, optimal, hydrocarbon, recovery, the, production, stage, is, the, most, important, stage, of, a, well, s, life, when, the, oil, and, gas, are, produced, by, this, time, the, oil, rigs, and, workover, rigs, used, to, drill, and, complete, the, well, will, have, moved, off, the, wellbore, and, the, top, is, usually, outfitted, with, a, collection, of, valves, called, a, christmas, tree, or, production, tree, these, valves, regulate, pressures, control, flows, and, allow, access, to, the, wellbore, in, case, further, completion, work, is, needed, from, the, outlet, valve, of, the, production, tree, the, flow, can, be, connected, to, a, distribution, network, of, pipelines, and, tanks, to, supply, the, product, to, refineries, natural, gas, compressor, stations, or, oil, export, terminals, as, long, as, the, pressure, in, the, reservoir, remains, high, enough, the, production, tree, is, all, that, is, required, to, produce, the, well, if, the, pressure, depletes, and, it, is, considered, economically, viable, an, artificial, lift, method, mentioned, in, the, completions, section, can, be, employed, workovers, are, often, necessary, in, older, wells, which, may, need, smaller, diameter, tubing, scale, or, paraffin, removal, acid, matrix, jobs, or, completion, in, new, zones, of, interest, in, a, shallower, reservoir, such, remedial, work, can, be, performed, using, workover, rigs, also, known, as, pulling, units, completion, rigs, or, service, rigs, to, pull, and, replace, tubing, or, by, the, use, of, well, intervention, techniques, utilizing, coiled, tubing, depending, on, the, type, of, lift, system, and, wellhead, a, rod, rig, or, flushby, can, be, used, to, change, a, pump, without, pulling, the, tubing, enhanced, recovery, methods, such, as, water, flooding, steam, flooding, or, co, 2, flooding, may, be, used, to, increase, reservoir, pressure, and, provide, a, sweep, effect, to, push, hydrocarbons, out, of, the, reservoir, such, methods, require, the, use, of, injection, wells, often, chosen, from, old, production, wells, in, a, carefully, determined, pattern, and, are, used, when, facing, problems, with, reservoir, pressure, depletion, or, high, oil, viscosity, sometimes, being, employed, early, in, a, field, s, life, in, certain, cases, depending, on, the, reservoir, s, geomechanics, reservoir, engineers, may, determine, that, ultimate, recoverable, oil, may, be, increased, by, applying, a, waterflooding, strategy, early, in, the, field, s, development, rather, than, later, such, enhanced, recovery, techniques, are, often, called, secondary, or, tertiary, recovery, orphan, orphaned, or, abandoned, wells, are, oil, or, gas, wells, that, have, been, abandoned, by, fossil, fuel, extraction, industries, these, wells, may, have, been, deactivated, because, had, become, uneconomic, failure, to, transfer, ownerships, especially, at, bankruptcy, of, companies, or, neglect, and, thus, no, longer, have, legal, owners, responsible, for, their, care, decommissioning, wells, effectively, can, be, expensive, costing, several, thousands, of, dollars, for, a, shallow, land, well, to, millions, of, dollars, for, an, offshore, one, thus, the, burden, may, fall, on, government, agencies, or, surface, landowners, when, a, business, entity, can, no, longer, be, held, responsible, orphan, wells, are, a, potent, contributor, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, such, as, methane, emissions, contributing, to, climate, change, much, of, this, leakage, can, be, attributed, to, failure, to, have, them, plugged, properly, or, leaking, plugs, a, 2020, estimate, of, abandoned, wells, in, the, united, states, was, that, methane, emissions, released, from, abandoned, wells, produced, greenhouse, gas, impacts, equivalent, to, three, weeks, of, us, oil, consumption, each, year, the, scale, of, leaking, abandoned, wells, is, well, understood, in, the, us, and, canada, because, of, public, data, and, regulation, however, a, reuters, investigation, in, 2020, could, not, find, good, estimates, for, russia, saudi, arabia, and, china, the, next, biggest, oil, and, gas, producers, however, they, estimate, there, are, 29, million, abandoned, wells, internationally, natural, gas, in, a, raw, form, known, as, associated, petroleum, gas, is, almost, always, a, by, product, of, producing, oil, the, short, light, gas, carbon, chains, come, out, of, solution, when, undergoing, pressure, reduction, from, the, reservoir, to, the, surface, similar, to, uncapping, a, bottle, of, soda, where, the, carbon, dioxide, effervesces, if, it, escapes, into, the, atmosphere, intentionally, it, is, known, as, vented, gas, or, if, unintentionally, as, fugitive, gas, unwanted, natural, gas, can, be, a, disposal, problem, at, wells, that, are, developed, to, produce, oil, if, there, are, no, pipelines, for, natural, gas, near, the, wellhead, it, may, be, of, no, value, to, the, oil, well, owner, since, it, cannot, reach, the, consumer, markets, such, unwanted, gas, may, then, be, burned, off, at, the, well, site, in, a, practice, known, as, production, flaring, but, due, to, the, energy, resource, waste, and, environmental, damage, concerns, this, practice, is, becoming, less, common, often, unwanted, or, stranded, gas, without, a, market, gas, is, returned, back, into, the, reservoir, with, an, injection, well, for, storage, or, for, re, pressurizing, the, producing, formation, another, solution, is, to, convert, the, natural, gas, to, a, liquid, fuel, gas, to, liquid, gtl, is, a, developing, technology, that, converts, stranded, natural, gas, into, synthetic, gasoline, diesel, or, jet, fuel, through, the, fischer, tropsch, process, developed, in, world, war, ii, germany, like, oil, such, dense, liquid, fuels, can, be, transported, using, conventional, tankers, for, trucking, to, refineries, or, users, proponents, claim, gtl, fuels, burn, cleaner, than, comparable, petroleum, fuels, most, major, international, oil, companies, are, in, advanced, development, stages, of, gtl, production, e, g, the, 140, 000, bbl, d, 22, 000, m, 3, d, pearl, gtl, plant, in, qatar, scheduled, to, come, online, in, 2011, in, locations, such, as, the, united, states, with, a, high, natural, gas, demand, pipelines, are, usually, favored, to, take, the, gas, from, the, well, site, to, the, end, consumer, wells, can, be, located, offshore, wells, can, further, be, subdivided, into, while, the, location, of, the, well, will, be, a, large, factor, in, the, type, of, equipment, used, to, drill, it, there, is, actually, little, downhole, difference, in, the, well, itself, an, offshore, well, targets, a, reservoir, that, happens, to, be, underneath, an, ocean, due, to, logistics, and, specialized, equipment, needed, drilling, an, offshore, well, is, far, more, costly, than, a, comparable, onshore, well, these, wells, dot, the, southern, and, central, great, plains, southwestern, united, states, and, are, the, most, common, wells, in, the, middle, east, another, way, to, classify, oil, wells, is, by, their, purpose, in, contributing, to, the, development, of, a, resource, they, can, be, characterized, as, at, a, producing, well, site, active, wells, may, be, further, categorized, as, lahee, classification, the, cost, to, drill, a, well, depends, mainly, on, the, daily, rate, of, the, drilling, rig, the, extra, services, required, to, drill, the, well, the, duration, of, the, well, program, including, downtime, and, weather, time, and, the, remoteness, of, the, location, logistic, supply, costs, the, daily, rates, of, offshore, drilling, rigs, vary, by, their, depth, capability, and, the, market, availability, rig, rates, reported, by, industry, web, service, show, that, the, deepwater, water, floating, drilling, rigs, are, over, twice, the, daily, cost, of, the, shallow, water, fleet, and, rates, for, jack, up, fleet, can, vary, by, factor, of, 3, depending, upon, capability, with, deepwater, drilling, rig, rates, in, 2015, of, around, 520, 000, day, and, similar, additional, spread, costs, a, deepwater, well, of, a, duration, of, 100, days, can, cost, around, us, 100, million, with, high, performance, jackup, rig, rates, in, 2015, of, around, 177, 000, and, similar, service, costs, a, high, pressure, high, temperature, well, of, duration, 100, days, can, cost, about, us, 30, million, onshore, wells, can, be, considerably, cheaper, particularly, if, the, field, is, at, a, shallow, depth, where, costs, range, from, less, than, 4, 9, million, to, 8, 3, million, and, the, average, completion, costing, 2, 9, million, to, 5, 6, million, per, well, completion, makes, up, a, larger, portion, of, onshore, well, costs, than, offshore, wells, which, generally, have, the, added, cost, burden, of, a, surface, platform, the, total, costs, mentioned, do, not, include, the, those, associated, with, the, risk, of, explosion, and, leakage, of, oil, those, costs, include, the, cost, of, protecting, against, such, disasters, the, cost, of, the, cleanup, effort, and, the, hard, to, calculate, cost, of, damage, to, the, company, s, image, the, impacts, of, oil, exploration, and, drilling, are, often, irreversible, particularly, for, wildlife, research, indicates, that, caribou, in, alaska, show, a, marked, avoidance, of, areas, near, oil, wells, and, seismic, lines, due, to, disturbances, drilling, often, destroys, wildlife, habitat, causing, wildlife, stress, and, breaks, up, large, areas, into, smaller, isolated, ones, changing, the, environment, and, forcing, animals, to, migrate, elsewhere, it, can, also, bring, in, new, species, that, compete, with, or, prey, on, existing, animals, even, though, the, actual, area, taken, up, by, oil, and, gas, equipment, might, be, small, negative, effects, can, spread, animals, like, mule, deer, and, elk, try, to, stay, away, from, the, noise, and, activity, of, drilling, sites, sometimes, moving, miles, away, to, find, peace, this, movement, and, avoidance, can, lead, to, less, space, for, these, animals, affecting, their, numbers, and, health, the, sage, grouse, is, another, example, of, an, animal, that, tries, to, avoid, areas, with, drilling, which, can, lead, to, fewer, of, them, surviving, and, reproducing, different, studies, show, that, drilling, in, their, habitats, negatively, impacts, sage, grouse, populations, in, wyoming, sage, grouse, studied, between, 1984, and, 2008, show, a, roughly, 2, 5, percent, annual, population, decline, in, males, correlating, with, the, density, of, oil, and, gas, wells, factors, such, as, sagebrush, cover, and, precipitation, seemed, to, have, little, effect, on, count, changes, these, results, align, with, other, studies, highlighting, the, detrimental, impact, of, oil, and, gas, development, on, sage, grouse, populations
