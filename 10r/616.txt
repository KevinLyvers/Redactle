the, john, f, kennedy, space, center, ksc, originally, known, as, the, nasa, launch, operations, center, located, on, merritt, island, florida, is, one, of, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, s, nasa, ten, field, centers, since, december, 1968, ksc, has, been, nasa, s, primary, launch, center, of, american, spaceflight, research, and, technology, launch, operations, for, the, apollo, skylab, and, space, shuttle, programs, were, carried, out, from, kennedy, space, center, launch, complex, 39, and, managed, by, ksc, located, on, the, east, coast, of, florida, ksc, is, adjacent, to, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, ccsfs, the, management, of, the, two, entities, work, very, closely, together, share, resources, and, operate, facilities, on, each, other, s, property, though, the, first, apollo, flights, and, all, project, mercury, and, project, gemini, flights, took, off, from, the, then, cape, canaveral, air, force, station, the, launches, were, managed, by, ksc, and, its, previous, organization, the, launch, operations, directorate, starting, with, the, fourth, gemini, mission, the, nasa, launch, control, center, in, florida, mercury, control, center, later, the, launch, control, center, began, handing, off, control, of, the, vehicle, to, the, mission, control, center, in, houston, shortly, after, liftoff, in, prior, missions, it, held, control, throughout, the, entire, mission, additionally, the, center, manages, launch, of, robotic, and, commercial, crew, missions, and, researches, food, production, and, in, situ, resource, utilization, for, off, earth, exploration, since, 2010, the, center, has, worked, to, become, a, multi, user, spaceport, through, industry, partnerships, even, adding, a, new, launch, pad, lc, 39c, in, 2015, there, are, about, 700, facilities, and, buildings, grouped, throughout, the, center, s, 144, 000, acres, 580, km, 2, among, the, unique, facilities, at, ksc, are, the, 525, foot, 160, m, tall, vehicle, assembly, building, for, stacking, nasa, s, largest, rockets, the, launch, control, center, which, conducts, space, launches, at, ksc, the, operations, and, checkout, building, which, houses, the, astronauts, dormitories, and, suit, up, area, a, space, station, factory, and, a, 3, mile, 4, 8, km, long, shuttle, landing, facility, there, is, also, a, visitor, complex, on, site, that, is, open, to, the, public, since, 1949, the, military, had, been, performing, launch, operations, at, what, would, become, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, in, december, 1959, the, department, of, defense, transferred, 5, 000, personnel, and, the, missile, firing, laboratory, to, nasa, to, become, the, launch, operations, directorate, under, nasa, s, marshall, space, flight, center, president, john, f, kennedy, s, 1961, goal, of, a, crewed, lunar, landing, by, 1970, required, an, expansion, of, launch, operations, on, july, 1, 1962, the, launch, operations, directorate, was, separated, from, msfc, to, become, the, launch, operations, center, loc, also, cape, canaveral, was, inadequate, to, host, the, new, launch, facility, design, required, for, the, mammoth, 363, foot, 111, m, tall, 7, 500, 000, pound, force, 33, 000, kn, thrust, saturn, v, rocket, which, would, be, assembled, vertically, in, a, large, hangar, and, transported, on, a, mobile, platform, to, one, of, several, launch, pads, therefore, the, decision, was, made, to, build, a, new, loc, site, located, adjacent, to, cape, canaveral, on, merritt, island, nasa, began, land, acquisition, in, 1962, buying, title, to, 131, square, miles, 340, km, 2, and, negotiating, with, the, state, of, florida, for, an, additional, 87, square, miles, 230, km, 2, the, major, buildings, in, ksc, s, industrial, area, were, designed, by, architect, charles, luckman, construction, began, in, november, 1962, and, kennedy, visited, the, site, twice, in, 1962, and, again, just, a, week, before, his, assassination, on, november, 22, 1963, on, november, 29, 1963, the, facility, was, named, by, president, lyndon, b, johnson, under, executive, order, 11129, johnson, s, order, joined, both, the, civilian, loc, and, the, military, cape, canaveral, station, the, facilities, of, station, no, 1, of, the, atlantic, missile, range, under, the, designation, john, f, kennedy, space, center, spawning, some, confusion, joining, the, two, in, the, public, mind, nasa, administrator, james, e, webb, clarified, this, by, issuing, a, directive, stating, the, kennedy, space, center, name, applied, only, to, the, loc, while, the, air, force, issued, a, general, order, renaming, the, military, launch, site, cape, kennedy, air, force, station, located, on, merritt, island, florida, the, center, is, north, northwest, of, cape, canaveral, on, the, atlantic, ocean, midway, between, miami, and, jacksonville, on, florida, s, space, coast, due, east, of, orlando, it, is, 34, miles, 55, km, long, and, roughly, six, miles, 9, 7, km, wide, covering, 219, square, miles, 570, km, 2, ksc, is, a, major, central, florida, tourist, destination, and, is, approximately, one, hour, s, drive, from, the, orlando, area, the, kennedy, space, center, visitor, complex, offers, public, tours, of, the, center, and, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, from, 1967, through, 1973, there, were, 13, saturn, v, launches, including, the, ten, remaining, apollo, missions, after, apollo, 7, the, first, of, two, uncrewed, flights, apollo, 4, apollo, saturn, 501, on, november, 9, 1967, was, also, the, first, rocket, launch, from, ksc, the, saturn, v, s, first, crewed, launch, on, december, 21, 1968, was, apollo, 8, s, lunar, orbiting, mission, the, next, two, missions, tested, the, lunar, module, apollo, 9, earth, orbit, and, apollo, 10, lunar, orbit, apollo, 11, launched, from, pad, a, on, july, 16, 1969, made, the, first, moon, landing, on, july, 20, the, apollo, 11, launch, included, crewmembers, neil, armstrong, michael, collins, and, buzz, aldrin, and, attracted, a, record, breaking, 650, million, television, viewers, apollo, 12, followed, four, months, later, from, 1970, to, 1972, the, apollo, program, concluded, at, ksc, with, the, launches, of, missions, 13, through, 17, on, may, 14, 1973, the, last, saturn, v, launch, put, the, skylab, space, station, in, orbit, from, pad, 39a, by, this, time, the, cape, kennedy, pads, 34, and, 37, used, for, the, saturn, ib, were, decommissioned, so, pad, 39b, was, modified, to, accommodate, the, saturn, ib, and, used, to, launch, three, crewed, missions, to, skylab, that, year, as, well, as, the, final, apollo, spacecraft, for, the, apollo, soyuz, test, project, in, 1975, as, the, space, shuttle, was, being, designed, nasa, received, proposals, for, building, alternative, launch, and, landing, sites, at, locations, other, than, ksc, which, demanded, study, ksc, had, important, advantages, including, its, existing, facilities, location, on, the, intracoastal, waterway, and, its, southern, latitude, which, gives, a, velocity, advantage, to, missions, launched, in, easterly, near, equatorial, orbits, disadvantages, included, its, inability, to, safely, launch, military, missions, into, polar, orbit, since, spent, boosters, would, be, likely, to, fall, on, the, carolinas, or, cuba, corrosion, from, the, salt, air, and, frequent, cloudy, or, stormy, weather, although, building, a, new, site, at, white, sands, missile, range, in, new, mexico, was, seriously, considered, nasa, announced, its, decision, in, april, 1972, to, use, ksc, for, the, shuttle, since, the, shuttle, could, not, be, landed, automatically, or, by, remote, control, the, launch, of, columbia, on, april, 12, 1981, for, its, first, orbital, mission, sts, 1, was, nasa, s, first, crewed, launch, of, a, vehicle, that, had, not, been, tested, in, prior, uncrewed, launches, in, 1976, the, vab, s, south, parking, area, was, the, site, of, third, century, america, a, science, and, technology, display, commemorating, the, u, s, bicentennial, concurrent, with, this, event, the, u, s, flag, was, painted, on, the, south, side, of, the, vab, during, the, late, 1970s, lc, 39, was, reconfigured, to, support, the, space, shuttle, two, orbiter, processing, facilities, were, built, near, the, vab, as, hangars, with, a, third, added, in, the, 1980s, ksc, s, 2, 9, mile, 4, 7, km, shuttle, landing, facility, slf, was, the, orbiters, primary, end, of, mission, landing, site, although, the, first, ksc, landing, did, not, take, place, until, the, tenth, flight, when, challenger, completed, sts, 41, b, on, february, 11, 1984, the, primary, landing, site, until, then, was, edwards, air, force, base, in, california, subsequently, used, as, a, backup, landing, site, the, slf, also, provided, a, return, to, launch, site, rtls, abort, option, which, was, not, utilized, the, slf, is, among, the, longest, runways, in, the, world, on, october, 28, 2009, the, ares, i, x, launch, from, pad, 39b, was, the, first, uncrewed, launch, from, ksc, since, the, skylab, workshop, in, 1973, beginning, in, 1958, nasa, and, military, worked, side, by, side, on, robotic, mission, launches, previously, referred, to, as, unmanned, cooperating, as, they, broke, ground, in, the, field, in, the, early, 1960s, nasa, had, as, many, as, two, robotic, mission, launches, a, month, the, frequent, number, of, flights, allowed, for, quick, evolution, of, the, vehicles, as, engineers, gathered, data, learned, from, anomalies, and, implemented, upgrades, in, 1963, with, the, intent, of, ksc, elv, work, focusing, on, the, ground, support, equipment, and, facilities, a, separate, atlas, centaur, organization, was, formed, under, nasa, s, lewis, center, now, glenn, research, center, grc, taking, that, responsibility, from, the, launch, operations, center, aka, ksc, though, almost, all, robotics, missions, launched, from, the, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, ccsfs, ksc, oversaw, the, final, assembly, and, testing, of, rockets, as, they, arrived, at, the, cape, in, 1965, ksc, s, unmanned, launch, operations, directorate, became, responsible, for, all, nasa, uncrewed, launch, operations, including, those, at, vandenberg, space, force, base, from, the, 1950s, to, 1978, ksc, chose, the, rocket, and, payload, processing, facilities, for, all, robotic, missions, launching, in, the, u, s, overseeing, their, near, launch, processing, and, checkout, in, addition, to, government, missions, ksc, performed, this, service, for, commercial, and, foreign, missions, also, though, non, u, s, government, entities, provided, reimbursement, nasa, also, funded, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, launch, pad, maintenance, and, launch, vehicle, improvements, all, this, changed, with, the, commercial, space, launch, act, of, 1984, after, which, nasa, only, coordinated, its, own, and, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, elv, launches, companies, were, able, to, operate, their, own, launch, vehicles, and, utilize, nasa, s, launch, facilities, payload, processing, handled, by, private, firms, also, started, to, occur, outside, of, ksc, reagan, s, 1988, space, policy, furthered, the, movement, of, this, work, from, ksc, to, commercial, companies, that, same, year, launch, complexes, on, cape, canaveral, air, force, force, station, started, transferring, from, nasa, to, air, force, space, command, management, in, the, 1990s, though, ksc, was, not, performing, the, hands, on, elv, work, engineers, still, maintained, an, understanding, of, elvs, and, had, contracts, allowing, them, insight, into, the, vehicles, so, they, could, provide, knowledgeable, oversight, ksc, also, worked, on, elv, research, and, analysis, and, the, contractors, were, able, to, utilize, ksc, personnel, as, a, resource, for, technical, issues, ksc, with, the, payload, and, launch, vehicle, industries, developed, advances, in, automation, of, the, elv, launch, and, ground, operations, to, enable, competitiveness, of, u, s, rockets, against, the, global, market, in, 1998, the, launch, services, program, lsp, formed, at, ksc, pulling, together, programs, and, personnel, that, already, existed, at, ksc, grc, goddard, space, flight, center, and, more, to, manage, the, launch, of, nasa, and, noaa, robotic, missions, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, and, vafb, are, the, primary, launch, sites, for, lsp, missions, though, other, sites, are, occasionally, used, lsp, payloads, such, as, the, mars, science, laboratory, have, been, processed, at, ksc, before, being, transferred, to, a, launch, pad, on, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, on, 16, november, 2022, at, 06, 47, 44, utc, the, space, launch, system, sls, was, launched, from, complex, 39b, as, part, of, the, artemis, 1, mission, as, the, international, space, station, modules, design, began, in, the, early, 1990s, ksc, began, to, work, with, other, nasa, centers, and, international, partners, to, prepare, for, processing, before, launch, onboard, the, space, shuttles, ksc, utilized, its, hands, on, experience, processing, the, 22, spacelab, missions, in, the, operations, and, checkout, building, to, gather, expectations, of, iss, processing, these, experiences, were, incorporated, into, the, design, of, the, space, station, processing, facility, sspf, which, began, construction, in, 1991, the, space, station, directorate, formed, in, 1996, ksc, personnel, were, embedded, at, station, module, factories, for, insight, into, their, processes, from, 1997, to, 2007, ksc, planned, and, performed, on, the, ground, integration, tests, and, checkouts, of, station, modules, three, multi, element, integration, testing, meit, sessions, and, the, integration, systems, test, ist, numerous, issues, were, found, and, corrected, that, would, have, been, difficult, to, nearly, impossible, to, do, on, orbit, today, ksc, continues, to, process, iss, payloads, from, across, the, world, before, launch, along, with, developing, its, experiments, for, on, orbit, the, proposed, lunar, gateway, would, be, manufactured, and, processed, at, the, space, station, processing, facility, the, following, are, current, programs, and, initiatives, at, kennedy, space, center, the, ksc, industrial, area, where, many, of, the, center, s, support, facilities, are, located, is, 5, miles, 8, km, south, of, lc, 39, it, includes, the, headquarters, building, the, operations, and, checkout, building, and, the, central, instrumentation, facility, the, astronaut, crew, quarters, are, in, the, o, c, before, it, was, completed, the, astronaut, crew, quarters, were, located, in, hangar, s, at, the, cape, canaveral, missile, test, annex, now, cape, canaveral, space, force, station, located, at, ksc, was, the, merritt, island, spaceflight, tracking, and, data, network, station, mila, a, key, radio, communications, and, spacecraft, tracking, complex, facilities, at, the, kennedy, space, center, are, directly, related, to, its, mission, to, launch, and, recover, missions, facilities, are, available, to, prepare, and, maintain, spacecraft, and, payloads, for, flight, the, headquarters, hq, building, houses, offices, for, the, center, director, library, film, and, photo, archives, a, print, shop, and, security, when, the, ksc, library, first, opened, it, was, part, of, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, however, in, 1965, the, library, moved, into, three, separate, sections, in, the, newly, opened, nasa, headquarters, before, eventually, becoming, a, single, unit, in, 1970, the, library, contains, over, four, million, items, related, to, the, history, and, the, work, at, kennedy, as, one, of, ten, nasa, center, libraries, in, the, country, their, collection, focuses, on, engineering, science, and, technology, the, archives, contain, planning, documents, film, reels, and, original, photographs, covering, the, history, of, ksc, the, library, is, not, open, to, the, public, but, is, available, for, ksc, space, force, and, navy, employees, who, work, on, site, many, of, the, media, items, from, the, collection, are, digitized, and, available, through, nasa, s, ksc, media, gallery, archived, december, 6, 2020, at, the, wayback, machine, or, through, their, more, up, to, date, flickr, gallery, a, new, headquarters, building, was, completed, in, 2019, as, part, of, the, central, campus, consolidation, groundbreaking, began, in, 2014, the, center, operated, its, own, 17, mile, 27, km, short, line, railroad, this, operation, was, discontinued, in, 2015, with, the, sale, of, its, final, two, locomotives, a, third, had, already, been, donated, to, a, museum, the, line, was, costing, 1, 3, million, annually, to, maintain, launch, complex, 39, lc, 39, was, originally, built, for, the, saturn, v, the, largest, and, most, powerful, operational, launch, vehicle, until, the, space, launch, system, for, the, apollo, crewed, moon, landing, program, since, the, end, of, the, apollo, program, in, 1972, lc, 39, has, been, used, to, launch, every, nasa, human, space, flight, including, skylab, 1973, the, apollo, soyuz, test, project, 1975, and, the, space, shuttle, program, 1981, 2011, since, december, 1968, all, launch, operations, have, been, conducted, from, launch, pads, a, and, b, at, lc, 39, both, pads, are, on, the, ocean, 3, miles, 4, 8, km, east, of, the, vab, from, 1969, to, 1972, lc, 39, was, the, moonport, for, all, six, apollo, crewed, moon, landing, missions, using, the, saturn, v, and, was, used, from, 1981, to, 2011, for, all, space, shuttle, launches, human, missions, to, the, moon, required, the, large, three, stage, saturn, v, rocket, which, was, 363, feet, 111, meters, tall, and, 33, feet, 10, meters, in, diameter, at, ksc, launch, complex, 39, was, built, on, merritt, island, to, accommodate, the, new, rocket, construction, of, the, 800, million, project, began, in, november, 1962, lc, 39, pads, a, and, b, were, completed, by, october, 1965, planned, pads, c, d, and, e, were, canceled, the, vab, was, completed, in, june, 1965, and, the, infrastructure, by, late, 1966, the, complex, includes, launch, complex, 48, lc, 48, is, a, multi, user, launch, site, under, construction, for, small, launchers,

a, clean, pad, to, support, multiple, launch, systems, with, differing, propellant, needs, while, initially, only, planned, to, have, a, single, pad, the, complex, is, capable, of, being, expanded, to, two, at, a, later, date, as, a, part, of, promoting, commercial, space, industry, growth, in, the, area, and, the, overall, center, as, a, multi, user, spaceport, ksc, leases, some, of, its, properties, here, are, some, major, examples, the, kennedy, space, center, visitor, complex, operated, by, delaware, north, since, 1995, has, a, variety, of, exhibits, artifacts, displays, and, attractions, on, the, history, and, future, of, human, and, robotic, spaceflight, bus, tours, of, ksc, originate, from, here, the, complex, also, includes, the, separate, apollo, saturn, v, center, north, of, the, vab, and, the, united, states, astronaut, hall, of, fame, six, miles, west, near, titusville, there, were, 1, 5, million, visitors, in, 2009, it, had, some, 700, employees, it, was, announced, on, may, 29, 2015, that, the, astronaut, hall, of, fame, exhibit, would, be, moved, from, its, current, location, to, another, location, within, the, visitor, complex, to, make, room, for, an, upcoming, high, tech, attraction, entitled, heroes, and, legends, the, attraction, designed, by, orlando, based, design, firm, falcon, s, treehouse, opened, november, 11, 2016, in, march, 2016, the, visitor, center, unveiled, the, new, location, of, the, iconic, countdown, clock, at, the, complex, s, entrance, previously, the, clock, was, located, with, a, flagpole, at, the, press, site, the, clock, was, originally, built, and, installed, in, 1969, and, listed, with, the, flagpole, in, the, national, register, of, historic, places, in, january, 2000, in, 2019, nasa, celebrated, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, apollo, program, and, the, launch, of, apollo, 10, on, may, 18, in, summer, of, 2019, lunar, module, 9, lm, 9, was, relocated, to, the, apollo, saturn, v, center, as, part, of, an, initiative, to, rededicate, the, center, and, celebrate, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, apollo, program, nasa, lists, the, following, historic, districts, at, ksc, each, district, has, multiple, associated, facilities, there, are, 24, historic, properties, outside, of, these, historic, districts, including, the, space, shuttle, atlantis, vehicle, assembly, building, crawlerway, and, operations, and, checkout, building, ksc, has, one, national, historic, landmark, 78, national, register, of, historic, places, nrhp, listed, or, eligible, sites, and, 100, archaeological, sites, florida, s, peninsular, shape, and, temperature, contrasts, between, land, and, ocean, provide, ideal, conditions, for, electrical, storms, earning, central, florida, the, reputation, as, lightning, capital, of, the, united, states, this, makes, extensive, lightning, protection, and, detection, systems, necessary, to, protect, employees, structures, and, spacecraft, on, launch, pads, on, november, 14, 1969, apollo, 12, was, struck, by, lightning, just, after, lift, off, from, pad, 39a, but, the, flight, continued, safely, the, most, powerful, lightning, strike, recorded, at, ksc, occurred, at, lc, 39b, on, august, 25, 2006, while, shuttle, atlantis, was, being, prepared, for, sts, 115, nasa, managers, were, initially, concerned, that, the, lightning, strike, caused, damage, to, atlantis, but, none, was, found, on, september, 7, 2004, hurricane, frances, directly, hit, the, area, with, sustained, winds, of, 70, miles, per, hour, 110, km, h, and, gusts, up, to, 94, miles,
