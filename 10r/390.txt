a, pigment, is, a, powder, used, to, add, color, or, change, visual, appearance, pigments, are, completely, or, nearly, insoluble, and, chemically, unreactive, in, water, or, another, medium, in, contrast, dyes, are, colored, substances, which, are, soluble, or, go, into, solution, at, some, stage, in, their, use, dyes, are, often, organic, compounds, whereas, pigments, are, often, inorganic, pigments, of, prehistoric, and, historic, value, include, ochre, charcoal, and, lapis, lazuli, in, 2006, around, 7, 4, million, tons, of, inorganic, organic, and, special, pigments, were, marketed, worldwide, according, to, an, april, 2018, report, by, bloomberg, businessweek, the, estimated, value, of, the, pigment, industry, globally, is, 30, billion, the, value, of, titanium, dioxide, used, to, enhance, the, white, brightness, of, many, products, was, placed, at, 13, 2, billion, per, year, while, the, color, ferrari, red, is, valued, at, 300, million, each, year, like, all, materials, the, color, of, pigments, arises, because, they, absorb, only, certain, wavelengths, of, visible, light, the, bonding, properties, of, the, material, determine, the, wavelength, and, efficiency, of, light, absorption, light, of, other, wavelengths, are, reflected, or, scattered, the, reflected, light, spectrum, defines, the, color, that, we, observe, the, appearance, of, pigments, is, sensitive, to, the, source, light, sunlight, has, a, high, color, temperature, and, a, fairly, uniform, spectrum, sunlight, is, considered, a, standard, for, white, light, artificial, light, sources, are, less, uniform, color, spaces, used, to, represent, colors, numerically, must, specify, their, light, source, lab, color, measurements, unless, otherwise, noted, assume, that, the, measurement, was, recorded, under, a, d65, light, source, or, daylight, 6500, k, which, is, roughly, the, color, temperature, of, sunlight, other, properties, of, a, color, such, as, its, saturation, or, lightness, may, be, determined, by, the, other, substances, that, accompany, pigments, binders, and, fillers, can, affect, the, color, minerals, have, been, used, as, colorants, since, prehistoric, times, early, humans, used, paint, for, aesthetic, purposes, such, as, body, decoration, pigments, and, paint, grinding, equipment, believed, to, be, between, 350, 000, and, 400, 000, years, old, have, been, reported, in, a, cave, at, twin, rivers, near, lusaka, zambia, ochre, iron, oxide, was, the, first, color, of, paint, a, favored, blue, pigment, was, derived, from, lapis, lazuli, pigments, based, on, minerals, and, clays, often, bear, the, name, of, the, city, or, region, where, they, were, originally, mined, raw, sienna, and, burnt, sienna, came, from, siena, italy, while, raw, umber, and, burnt, umber, came, from, umbria, these, pigments, were, among, the, easiest, to, synthesize, and, chemists, created, modern, colors, based, on, the, originals, these, were, more, consistent, than, colors, mined, from, the, original, ore, bodies, but, the, place, names, remained, also, found, in, many, paleolithic, and, neolithic, cave, paintings, are, red, ochre, anhydrous, fe, 2, o, 3, and, the, hydrated, yellow, ochre, fe, 2, o, 3, h, 2, o, charcoal, or, carbon, black, has, also, been, used, as, a, black, pigment, since, prehistoric, times, the, first, known, synthetic, pigment, was, egyptian, blue, which, is, first, attested, on, an, alabaster, bowl, in, egypt, dated, to, naqada, iii, circa, 3250, bc, egyptian, blue, blue, frit, calcium, copper, silicate, cacusi, 4, o, 10, made, by, heating, a, mixture, of, quartz, sand, lime, a, flux, and, a, copper, source, such, as, malachite, already, invented, in, the, predynastic, period, of, egypt, its, use, became, widespread, by, the, 4th, dynasty, it, was, the, blue, pigment, par, excellence, of, roman, antiquity, its, art, technological, traces, vanished, in, the, course, of, the, middle, ages, until, its, rediscovery, in, the, context, of, the, egyptian, campaign, and, the, excavations, in, pompeii, and, herculaneum, later, premodern, synthetic, pigments, include, white, lead, basic, lead, carbonate, pbco, 3, 2, pb, oh, 2, vermilion, verdigris, and, lead, tin, yellow, vermilion, a, mercury, sulfide, was, originally, made, by, grinding, a, powder, of, natural, cinnabar, from, the, 17th, century, on, it, was, also, synthesized, from, the, elements, it, was, favored, by, old, masters, such, as, titian, indian, yellow, was, once, produced, by, collecting, the, urine, of, cattle, that, had, been, fed, only, mango, leaves, dutch, and, flemish, painters, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, favored, it, for, its, luminescent, qualities, and, often, used, it, to, represent, sunlight, since, mango, leaves, are, nutritionally, inadequate, for, cattle, the, practice, of, harvesting, indian, yellow, was, eventually, declared, to, be, inhumane, modern, hues, of, indian, yellow, are, made, from, synthetic, pigments, vermillion, has, been, partially, replaced, in, by, cadmium, reds, because, of, the, cost, of, lapis, lazuli, substitutes, were, often, used, prussian, blue, the, oldest, modern, synthetic, pigment, was, discovered, by, accident, in, 1704, by, the, early, 19th, century, synthetic, and, metallic, blue, pigments, included, french, ultramarine, a, synthetic, form, of, lapis, lazuli, ultramarine, was, manufactured, by, treating, aluminium, silicate, with, sulfur, various, forms, of, cobalt, blue, and, cerulean, blue, were, also, introduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, phthalo, blue, a, synthetic, metallo, organic, pigment, was, prepared, at, the, same, time, royal, blue, another, name, once, given, to, tints, produced, from, lapis, lazuli, has, evolved, to, signify, a, much, lighter, and, brighter, color, and, is, usually, mixed, from, phthalo, blue, and, titanium, dioxide, or, from, inexpensive, synthetic, blue, dyes, the, discovery, in, 1856, of, mauveine, the, first, aniline, dyes, was, a, forerunner, for, the, development, of, hundreds, of, synthetic, dyes, and, pigments, like, azo, and, diazo, compounds, these, dyes, ushered, in, the, flourishing, of, organic, chemistry, including, systematic, designs, of, colorants, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, diminished, the, dependence, on, inorganic, pigments, before, the, development, of, synthetic, pigments, and, the, refinement, of, techniques, for, extracting, mineral, pigments, batches, of, color, were, often, inconsistent, with, the, development, of, a, modern, color, industry, manufacturers, and, professionals, have, cooperated, to, create, international, standards, for, identifying, producing, measuring, and, testing, colors, first, published, in, 1905, the, munsell, color, system, became, the, foundation, for, a, series, of, color, models, providing, objective, methods, for, the, measurement, of, color, the, munsell, system, describes, a, color, in, three, dimensions, hue, value, lightness, and, chroma, color, purity, where, chroma, is, the, difference, from, gray, at, a, given, hue, and, value, by, the, middle, 20th, century, standardized, methods, for, pigment, chemistry, were, available, part, of, an, international, movement, to, create, such, standards, in, industry, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, develops, technical, standards, for, the, manufacture, of, pigments, and, dyes, iso, standards, define, various, industrial, and, chemical, properties, and, how, to, test, for, them, the, principal, iso, standards, that, relate, to, all, pigments, are, as, follows, other, iso, standards, pertain, to, particular, classes, or, categories, of, pigments, based, on, their, chemical, composition, such, as, ultramarine, pigments, titanium, dioxide, iron, oxide, pigments, and, so, forth, many, manufacturers, of, paints, inks, textiles, plastics, and, colors, have, voluntarily, adopted, the, colour, index, international, cii, as, a, standard, for, identifying, the, pigments, that, they, use, in, manufacturing, particular, colors, first, published, in, 1925, and, now, published, jointly, on, the, web, by, the, society, of, dyers, and, colourists, united, kingdom, and, the, american, association, of, textile, chemists, and, colorists, us, this, index, is, recognized, internationally, as, the, authoritative, reference, on, colorants, it, encompasses, more, than, 27, 000, products, under, more, than, 13, 000, generic, color, index, names, in, the, cii, schema, each, pigment, has, a, generic, index, number, that, identifies, it, chemically, regardless, of, proprietary, and, historic, names, for, example, phthalocyanine, blue, bn, has, been, known, by, a, variety, of, generic, and, proprietary, names, since, its, discovery, in, the, 1930s, in, much, of, europe, phthalocyanine, blue, is, better, known, as, helio, blue, or, by, a, proprietary, name, such, as, winsor, blue, an, american, paint, manufacturer, grumbacher, registered, an, alternate, spelling, thanos, blue, as, a, trademark, colour, index, international, resolves, all, these, conflicting, historic, generic, and, proprietary, names, so, that, manufacturers, and, consumers, can, identify, the, pigment, or, dye, used, in, a, particular, color, product, in, the, cii, all, phthalocyanine, blue, pigments, are, designated, by, a, generic, color, index, number, as, either, pb15, or, pb16, short, for, pigment, blue, 15, and, pigment, blue, 16, these, two, numbers, reflect, slight, variations, in, molecular, structure, which, produce, a, slightly, more, greenish, or, reddish, blue, the, following, are, some, of, the, attributes, of, pigments, that, determine, their, suitability, for, particular, manufacturing, processes, and, applications, swatches, are, used, to, communicate, colors, accurately, the, types, of, swatches, are, dictated, by, the, media, i, e, printing, computers, plastics, and, textiles, generally, the, medium, that, offers, the, broadest, gamut, of, color, shades, is, widely, used, across, diverse, media, reference, standards, are, provided, by, printed, swatches, of, color, shades, pantone, ral, munsell, etc, are, widely, used, standards, of, color, communication, across, diverse, media, like, printing, plastics, and, textiles, companies, manufacturing, color, masterbatches, and, pigments, for, plastics, offer, plastic, swatches, in, injection, molded, color, chips, these, color, chips, are, supplied, to, the, designer, or, customer, to, choose, and, select, the, color, for, their, specific, plastic, products, plastic, swatches, are, available, in, various, special, effects, like, pearl, metallic, fluorescent, sparkle, mosaic, etc, however, these, effects, are, difficult, to, replicate, on, other, media, like, print, and, computer, display, plastic, swatches, have, been, created, by, 3d, modelling, to, including, various, special, effects, the, appearance, of, pigments, in, natural, light, is, difficult, to, replicate, on, a, computer, display, approximations, are, required, the, munsell, color, system, provides, an, objective, measure, of, color, in, three, dimensions, hue, value, or, lightness, and, chroma, computer, displays, in, general, fail, to, show, the, true, chroma, of, many, pigments, but, the, hue, and, lightness, can, be, reproduced, with, relative, accuracy, however, when, the, gamma, of, a, computer, display, deviates, from, the, reference, value, the, hue, is, also, systematically, biased, the, following, approximations, assume, a, display, device, at, gamma, 2, 2, using, the, srgb, color, space, the, further, a, display, device, deviates, from, these, standards, the, less, accurate, these, swatches, will, be, swatches, are, based, on, the, average, measurements, of, several, lots, of, single, pigment, watercolor, paints, converted, from, lab, color, space, to, srgb, color, space, for, viewing, on, a, computer, display, the, appearance, of, a, pigment, may, depend, on, the, brand, and, even, the, batch, furthermore, pigments, have, inherently, complex, reflectance, spectra, that, will, render, their, color, appearance, greatly, different, depending, on, the, spectrum, of, the, source, illumination, a, property, called, metamerism, averaged, measurements, of, pigment, samples, will, only, yield, approximations, of, their, true, appearance, under, a, specific, source, of, illumination, computer, display, systems, use, a, technique, called, chromatic, adaptation, transforms, to, emulate, the, correlated, color, temperature, of, illumination, sources, and, cannot, perfectly, reproduce, the, intricate, spectral, combinations, originally, seen, in, many, cases, the, perceived, color, of, a, pigment, falls, outside, of, the, gamut, of, computer, displays, and, a, method, called, gamut, mapping, is, used, to, approximate, the, true, appearance, gamut, mapping, trades, off, any, one, of, lightness, hue, or, saturation, accuracy, to, render, the, color, on, screen, depending, on, the, priority, chosen, in, the, conversion, s, icc, rendering, intent, in, biology, a, pigment, is, any, colored, material, of, plant, or, animal, cells, many, biological, structures, such, as, skin, eyes, fur, and, hair, contain, pigments, such, as, melanin, animal, skin, coloration, often, comes, about, through, specialized, cells, called, chromatophores, which, animals, such, as, the, octopus, and, chameleon, can, control, to, vary, the, animal, s, color, many, conditions, affect, the, levels, or, nature, of, pigments, in, plant, animal, some, protista, or, fungus, cells, for, instance, the, disorder, called, albinism, affects, the, level, of, melanin, production, in, animals, pigmentation, in, organisms, serves, many, biological, purposes, including, camouflage, mimicry, aposematism, warning, sexual, selection, and, other, forms, of, signalling, photosynthesis, in, plants, and, basic, physical, purposes, such, as, protection, from, sunburn, pigment, color, differs, from, structural, color, in, that, pigment, color, is, the, same, for, all, viewing, angles, whereas, structural, color, is, the, result, of, selective, reflection, or, iridescence, usually, because, of, multilayer, structures, for, example, butterfly, wings, typically, contain, structural, color, although, many, butterflies, have, cells, that, contain, pigment, as, well
