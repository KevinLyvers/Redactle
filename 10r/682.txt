a, carriage, is, a, two, or, four, wheeled, horse, drawn, vehicle, for, passengers, second, hand, private, carriages, were, common, public, transport, the, equivalent, of, modern, cars, used, as, taxis, carriage, suspensions, are, by, leather, strapping, or, on, those, made, in, recent, centuries, steel, springs, two, wheeled, carriages, are, usually, owner, driven, coaches, are, a, special, category, within, carriages, they, are, carriages, with, four, corner, posts, and, a, fixed, roof, two, wheeled, war, chariots, and, transport, vehicles, such, as, four, wheeled, wagons, and, two, wheeled, carts, were, forerunners, of, carriages, in, the, 21st, century, horse, drawn, carriages, are, occasionally, used, for, public, parades, by, royalty, and, for, traditional, formal, ceremonies, simplified, modern, versions, are, made, for, tourist, transport, in, warm, countries, and, for, those, cities, where, tourists, expect, open, horse, drawn, carriages, to, be, provided, simple, metal, sporting, versions, are, still, made, for, the, sport, known, as, competitive, driving, the, word, carriage, abbreviated, carr, or, cge, is, from, old, northern, french, cariage, to, carry, in, a, vehicle, the, word, car, then, meaning, a, kind, of, two, wheeled, cart, for, goods, also, came, from, old, northern, french, about, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, probably, derived, from, the, late, latin, carro, a, car, it, is, also, used, for, railway, carriages, and, in, the, us, around, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, early, cars, automobiles, were, briefly, called, horseless, carriages, some, horse, carts, found, in, celtic, graves, show, hints, that, their, platforms, were, suspended, elastically, four, wheeled, wagons, were, used, in, bronze, age, europe, and, their, form, known, from, excavations, suggests, that, the, basic, construction, techniques, of, wheel, and, undercarriage, that, survived, until, the, age, of, the, motor, car, were, established, then, first, prototyped, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, a, bullock, cart, is, a, large, two, wheeled, cart, pulled, by, oxen, or, buffalo, it, includes, a, sturdy, wooden, pole, between, the, oxen, a, yoke, connecting, a, pair, of, oxen, a, wooden, platform, for, passengers, or, cargo, and, large, steel, rimmed, wooden, wheels, two, wheeled, carriage, models, have, been, discovered, from, the, indus, valley, civilization, including, twin, horse, drawn, covered, carriages, resembling, ekka, from, various, sites, such, as, harappa, mohenjo, daro, and, chanhu, daro, the, earliest, recorded, sort, of, carriage, was, the, chariot, reaching, mesopotamia, as, early, as, 1900, bc, used, typically, for, warfare, by, egyptians, the, near, easterners, and, europeans, it, was, essentially, a, two, wheeled, light, basin, carrying, one, or, two, standing, passengers, drawn, by, one, to, two, horses, the, chariot, was, revolutionary, and, effective, because, it, delivered, fresh, warriors, to, crucial, areas, of, battle, with, swiftness, first, century, bc, romans, used, sprung, wagons, for, overland, journeys, it, is, likely, that, roman, carriages, employed, some, form, of, suspension, on, chains, or, leather, straps, as, indicated, by, carriage, parts, found, in, excavations, in, 2021, archaeologists, discovered, the, remains, of, a, ceremonial, four, wheel, carriage, a, pilentum, near, the, ancient, roman, city, of, pompeii, it, is, thought, the, pilentum, may, have, been, used, in, ceremonies, such, as, weddings, the, find, has, been, described, as, being, in, an, excellent, state, of, preservation, though, the, exact, date, of, when, the, chinese, started, to, use, carriages, is, largely, unknown, early, oracle, bone, inscriptions, discovered, in, henan, province, show, that, the, carriage, had, already, developed, into, many, different, forms, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, chariots, in, china, a, chariot, burial, site, discovered, in, 1933, at, hougang, anyang, in, henan, province, dates, to, the, rule, of, king, wu, ding, of, the, late, shang, dynasty, c, 1250, bce, oracle, bone, inscriptions, suggest, that, the, western, enemies, of, the, shang, used, limited, numbers, of, chariots, in, battle, but, the, shang, themselves, used, them, only, as, mobile, command, vehicles, and, in, royal, hunts, during, the, shang, dynasty, members, of, the, royal, family, were, buried, with, a, complete, household, and, servants, including, a, chariot, horses, and, a, charioteer, a, shang, chariot, was, often, drawn, by, two, horses, but, four, horse, variants, are, occasionally, found, in, burials, jacques, gernet, claims, that, the, zhou, dynasty, which, conquered, the, shang, ca, 1046, bce, made, more, use, of, the, chariot, than, did, the, shang, and, invented, a, new, kind, of, harness, with, four, horses, abreast, the, crew, consisted, of, an, archer, a, driver, and, sometimes, a, third, warrior, who, was, armed, with, a, spear, or, dagger, axe, from, the, 8th, to, 5th, centuries, bce, the, chinese, use, of, chariots, reached, its, peak, although, chariots, appeared, in, greater, numbers, infantry, often, defeated, charioteers, in, battle, massed, chariot, warfare, became, all, but, obsolete, after, the, warring, states, period, 476, 221, bce, the, main, reasons, were, increased, use, of, the, crossbow, use, of, long, halberds, up, to, 18, feet, 5, 49, m, long, and, pikes, up, to, 22, feet, 6, 71, m, long, and, the, adoption, of, standard, cavalry, units, and, the, adaptation, of, mounted, archery, from, nomadic, cavalry, which, were, more, effective, chariots, would, continue, to, serve, as, command, posts, for, officers, during, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 206, bce, and, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce, while, armored, chariots, were, also, used, during, the, han, dynasty, against, the, xiongnu, confederation, in, the, han, xiongnu, war, 133, bc, to, 89, ce, specifically, at, the, battle, of, mobei, 119, bce, before, the, han, dynasty, the, power, of, chinese, states, and, dynasties, was, often, measured, by, the, number, of, chariots, they, were, known, to, have, a, country, of, a, thousand, chariots, ranked, as, a, medium, country, and, a, country, of, ten, thousand, chariots, ranked, as, a, huge, and, powerful, country, the, medieval, carriage, was, typically, a, four, wheeled, wagon, type, with, a, rounded, top, tilt, similar, in, appearance, to, the, conestoga, wagon, familiar, from, the, united, states, sharing, the, traditional, form, of, wheels, and, undercarriage, known, since, the, bronze, age, it, very, likely, also, employed, the, pivoting, fore, axle, in, continuity, from, the, ancient, world, suspension, on, chains, is, recorded, in, visual, images, and, written, accounts, from, the, 14th, century, chars, branlant, or, rocking, carriages, and, was, in, widespread, use, by, the, 15th, century, carriages, were, largely, used, by, royalty, aristocrats, and, especially, by, women, and, could, be, elaborately, decorated, and, gilded, these, carriages, were, usually, on, four, wheels, and, were, drawn, by, two, to, four, horses, depending, on, their, size, and, status, wood, and, iron, were, the, primary, materials, needed, to, build, a, carriage, and, carriages, that, were, used, by, non, royalty, were, covered, by, plain, leather, another, form, of, carriage, was, the, pageant, wagon, of, the, 14th, century, historians, debate, the, structure, and, size, of, pageant, wagons, however, they, are, generally, miniature, house, like, structures, that, rest, on, four, to, six, wheels, depending, on, the, size, of, the, wagon, the, pageant, wagon, is, significant, because, up, until, the, 14th, century, most, carriages, were, on, two, or, three, wheels, the, chariot, rocking, carriage, and, baby, carriage, are, two, examples, of, carriages, which, pre, date, the, pageant, wagon, historians, also, debate, whether, or, not, pageant, wagons, were, built, with, pivotal, axle, systems, which, allowed, the, wheels, to, turn, whether, it, was, a, four, or, six, wheel, pageant, wagon, most, historians, maintain, that, pivotal, axle, systems, were, implemented, on, pageant, wagons, because, many, roads, were, often, winding, with, some, sharp, turns, six, wheel, pageant, wagons, also, represent, another, innovation, in, carriages, they, were, one, of, the, first, carriages, to, use, multiple, pivotal, axles, pivotal, axles, were, used, on, the, front, set, of, wheels, and, the, middle, set, of, wheels, this, allowed, the, horse, to, move, freely, and, steer, the, carriage, in, accordance, with, the, road, or, path, one, of, the, great, innovations, in, carriage, history, was, the, invention, of, the, suspended, carriage, or, the, chariot, branlant, though, whether, this, was, a, roman, or, medieval, innovation, remains, uncertain, the, chariot, branlant, of, medieval, illustrations, was, suspended, by, chains, rather, than, leather, straps, as, had, been, believed, suspension, whether, on, chains, or, leather, might, provide, a, smoother, ride, since, the, carriage, body, no, longer, rested, on, the, axles, but, could, not, prevent, swinging, branlant, in, all, directions, it, is, clear, from, illustrations, and, surviving, examples, that, the, medieval, suspended, carriage, with, a, round, tilt, was, a, widespread, european, type, referred, to, by, any, number, of, names, car, currus, char, chariot, in, 14th, century, england, carriages, like, the, one, illustrated, in, the, luttrell, psalter, would, still, have, been, a, quite, rare, means, of, aristocratic, transport, and, they, would, have, been, very, costly, until, the, end, of, the, century, they, would, have, had, four, six, spoke, six, foot, high, wheels, that, were, linked, by, greased, axles, under, the, body, of, the, coach, and, did, not, necessarily, have, any, suspension, the, chassis, was, made, from, oak, beam, and, the, barrel, shaped, roof, was, covered, in, brightly, painted, leather, or, cloth, the, interior, would, include, seats, beds, cushions, tapestries, and, even, rugs, they, would, be, pulled, by, four, to, five, horses, under, king, mathias, corvinus, 1458, 90, who, enjoyed, fast, travel, the, hungarians, developed, fast, road, transport, and, the, town, of, kocs, between, budapest, and, vienna, became, an, important, post, town, and, gave, its, name, to, the, new, vehicle, type, the, earliest, illustrations, of, the, hungarian, kochi, wagon, do, not, indicate, any, suspension, a, body, with, high, sides, of, lightweight, wickerwork, and, typically, drawn, by, three, horses, in, harness, later, models, were, considerably, lighter, and, famous, for, a, single, horse, being, able, to, draw, many, passengers, the, hungarian, coach, spread, across, europe, initially, rather, slowly, in, part, due, to, ippolito, d, este, of, ferrara, 1479, 1529, nephew, of, mathias, queen, beatrix, of, aragon, who, as, a, very, junior, archbishopric, of, esztergom, developed, a, taste, for, hungarian, riding, and, took, his, carriage, and, driver, back, to, italy, then, rather, suddenly, in, around, 1550, the, coach, made, its, appearance, throughout, the, major, cities, of, europe, and, the, new, word, entered, the, vocabulary, of, all, their, languages, however, the, new, coach, seems, to, have, been, a, fashionable, concept, fast, road, travel, for, men, as, much, as, any, particular, type, of, vehicle, and, there, is, no, obvious, technological, change, that, accompanied, the, innovation, either, in, the, use, of, suspension, which, came, earlier, or, the, adoption, of, springs, which, came, later, as, its, use, spread, throughout, europe, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, coach, s, body, structure, was, ultimately, changed, from, a, round, topped, tilt, to, the, four, poster, carriages, that, became, standard, everywhere, by, c, 1600, the, coach, had, doors, in, the, side, with, an, iron, step, protected, by, leather, that, became, the, boot, in, which, servants, might, ride, the, driver, sat, on, a, seat, at, the, front, and, the, most, important, occupant, sat, in, the, back, facing, forwards, the, earliest, coaches, can, be, seen, at, veste, coburg, lisbon, and, the, moscow, kremlin, and, they, become, a, commonplace, in, european, art, it, was, not, until, the, 17th, century, that, further, innovations, with, steel, springs, and, glazing, took, place, and, only, in, the, 18th, century, with, better, road, surfaces, was, there, a, major, innovation, with, the, introduction, of, the, steel, c, spring, many, innovations, were, proposed, and, some, patented, for, new, types, of, suspension, or, other, features, it, was, only, from, the, 18th, century, that, changes, to, steering, systems, were, suggested, including, the, use, of, the, fifth, wheel, substituted, for, the, pivoting, fore, axle, and, on, which, the, carriage, turned, another, proposal, came, from, erasmus, darwin, a, young, english, doctor, who, was, driving, a, carriage, about, 10, 000, miles, a, year, to, visit, patients, all, over, england, darwin, found, two, essential, problems, or, shortcomings, of, the, commonly, used, light, carriage, or, hungarian, carriage, first, the, front, wheels, were, turned, by, a, pivoting, front, axle, which, had, been, used, for, years, but, these, wheels, were, often, quite, small, and, hence, the, rider, carriage, and, horse, felt, the, brunt, of, every, bump, on, the, road, secondly, he, recognized, the, danger, of, overturning, a, pivoting, front, axle, changes, a, carriage, s, base, from, a, rectangle, to, a, triangle, because, the, wheel, on, the, inside, of, the, turn, is, able, to, turn, more, sharply, than, the, outside, front, wheel, darwin, suggested, a, fix, for, these, insufficiencies, by, proposing, a, principle, in, which, the, two, front, wheels, turn, independently, of, the, front, axle, about, a, centre, that, lies, on, the, extended, line, of, the, back, axle, this, idea, was, later, patented, in, 1818, as, ackermann, steering, darwin, argued, that, carriages, would, then, be, easier, to, pull, and, less, likely, to, overturn, carriage, use, in, north, america, came, with, the, establishment, of, european, settlers, early, colonial, horse, tracks, quickly, grew, into, roads, especially, as, the, colonists, extended, their, territories, southwest, colonists, began, using, carts, as, these, roads, and, trading, increased, between, the, north, and, south, eventually, carriages, or, coaches, were, sought, to, transport, goods, as, well, as, people, as, in, europe, chariots, coaches, and, or, carriages, were, a, mark, of, status, the, tobacco, planters, of, the, south, were, some, of, the, first, americans, to, use, the, carriage, as, a, form, of, human, transportation, as, the, tobacco, farming, industry, grew, in, the, southern, colonies, so, did, the, frequency, of, carriages, coaches, and, wagons, upon, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, wheeled, vehicle, use, in, the, colonies, was, at, an, all, time, high, carriages, coaches, and, wagons, were, being, taxed, based, on, the, number, of, wheels, they, had, these, taxes, were, implemented, in, the, south, primarily, as, the, south, had, superior, numbers, of, horses, and, wheeled, vehicles, when, compared, to, the, north, europe, however, still, used, carriage, transportation, far, more, often, and, on, a, much, larger, scale, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, carriages, and, coaches, began, to, disappear, as, use, of, steam, propulsion, began, to, generate, more, and, more, interest, and, research, steam, power, quickly, won, the, battle, against, animal, power, as, is, evident, by, a, newspaper, article, written, in, england, in, 1895, entitled, horseflesh, vs, steam, the, article, highlights, the, death, of, the, carriage, as, the, main, means, of, transportation, today, carriages, are, still, used, for, day, to, day, transport, in, the, united, states, by, some, minority, groups, such, as, the, amish, they, are, also, still, used, in, tourism, as, vehicles, for, sightseeing, in, cities, such, as, bruges, vienna, new, orleans, and, little, rock, arkansas, the, most, complete, working, collection, of, carriages, can, be, seen, at, the, royal, mews, in, london, where, a, large, selection, of, vehicles, is, in, regular, use, these, are, supported, by, a, staff, of, liveried, coachmen, footmen, and, postillions, the, horses, earn, their, keep, by, supporting, the, work, of, the, royal, household, particularly, during, ceremonial, events, horses, pulling, a, large, carriage, known, as, a, covered, brake, collect, the, yeoman, of, the, guard, in, their, distinctive, red, uniforms, from, st, james, s, palace, for, investitures, at, buckingham, palace, high, commissioners, or, ambassadors, are, driven, to, their, audiences, with, the, king, and, queen, in, landaus, visiting, heads, of, state, are, transported, to, and, from, official, arrival, ceremonies, and, members, of, the, royal, family, are, driven, in, royal, mews, coaches, during, trooping, the, colour, the, order, of, the, garter, service, at, windsor, castle, and, carriage, processions, at, the, beginning, of, each, day, of, royal, ascot, carriages, may, be, enclosed, or, open, depending, on, the, type, the, top, cover, for, the, body, of, a, carriage, called, the, head, or, hood, is, often, flexible, and, designed, to, be, folded, back, when, desired, such, a, folding, top, is, called, a, bellows, top, or, calash, a, hoopstick, forms, a, light, framing, member, for, this, kind, of, hood, the, top, roof, or, second, story, compartment, of, a, closed, carriage, especially, a, diligence, was, called, an, imperial, a, closed, carriage, may, have, side, windows, called, quarter, lights, british, as, well, as, windows, in, the, doors, hence, a, glass, coach, on, the, forepart, of, an, open, carriage, a, screen, of, wood, or, leather, called, a, dashboard, intercepts, water, mud, or, snow, thrown, up, by, the, heels, of, the, horses, the, dashboard, or, carriage, top, sometimes, has, a, projecting, sidepiece, called, a, wing, british, a, foot, iron, or, footplate, may, serve, as, a, carriage, step, a, carriage, driver, sits, on, a, box, or, perch, usually, elevated, and, small, when, at, the, front, it, is, known, as, a, dickey, box, a, term, also, used, for, a, seat, at, the, back, for, servants, a, footman, might, use, a, small, platform, at, the, rear, called, a, footboard, or, a, seat, called, a, rumble, behind, the, body, some, carriages, have, a, moveable, seat, called, a, jump, seat, some, seats, had, an, attached, backrest, called, a, lazyback, the, shafts, of, a, carriage, were, called, limbers, in, english, dialect, lancewood, a, tough, elastic, wood, of, various, trees, was, often, used, especially, for, carriage, shafts, a, holdback, consisting, of, an, iron, catch, on, the, shaft, with, a, looped, strap, enables, a, horse, to, back, or, hold, back, the, vehicle, the, end, of, the, tongue, of, a, carriage, is, suspended, from, the, collars, of, the, harness, by, a, bar, called, the, yoke, at, the, end, of, a, trace, a, loop, called, a, cockeye, attaches, to, the, carriage, in, some, carriage, types, the, body, is, suspended, from, several, leather, straps, called, braces, or, thoroughbraces, attached, to, or, serving, as, springs, beneath, the, carriage, body, is, the, undergear, or, undercarriage, or, simply, carriage, consisting, of, the, running, gear, and, chassis, the, wheels, and, axles, in, distinction, from, the, body, are, the, running, gear, the, wheels, revolve, upon, bearings, or, a, spindle, at, the, ends, of, a, bar, or, beam, called, an, axle, or, axletree, most, carriages, have, either, one, or, two, axles, on, a, four, wheeled, vehicle, the, forward, part, of, the, running, gear, or, forecarriage, is, arranged, to, permit, the, front, axle, to, turn, independently, of, the, fixed, rear, axle, in, some, carriages, a, dropped, axle, bent, twice, at, a, right, angle, near, the, ends, allows, for, a, low, body, with, large, wheels, a, guard, called, a, dirtboard, keeps, dirt, from, the, axle, arm, several, structural, members, form, parts, of, the, chassis, supporting, the, carriage, body, the, fore, axletree, and, the, splinter, bar, above, it, supporting, the, springs, are, united, by, a, piece, of, wood, or, metal, called, a, futchel, which, forms, a, socket, for, the, pole, that, extends, from, the, front, axle, for, strength, and, support, a, rod, called, the, backstay, may, extend, from, either, end, of, the, rear, axle, to, the, reach, the, pole, or, rod, joining, the, hind, axle, to, the, forward, bolster, above, the, front, axle, a, skid, called, a, drag, dragshoe, shoe, or, skidpan, retards, the, motion, of, the, wheels, a, london, patent, of, 1841, describes, one, such, apparatus, an, iron, shod, beam, slightly, longer, than, the, radius, of, the, wheel, is, hinged, under, the, axle, so, that, when, it, is, released, to, strike, the, ground, the, forward, momentum, of, the, vehicle, wedges, it, against, the, axle, the, original, feature, of, this, modification, was, that, instead, of, the, usual, practice, of, having, to, stop, the, carriage, to, retract, the, beam, and, so, lose, useful, momentum, the, chain, holding, it, in, place, is, released, from, the, driver, s, position, so, that, it, is, allowed, to, rotate, further, in, its, backwards, direction, releasing, the, axle, a, system, of, pendant, levers, and, straps, then, allows, the, beam, to, return, to, its, first, position, and, be, ready, for, further, use, a, catch, or, block, called, a, trigger, may, be, used, to, hold, a, wheel, on, an, incline, a, horizontal, wheel, or, segment, of, a, wheel, called, a, fifth, wheel, sometimes, forms, an, extended, support, to, prevent, the, carriage, from, tipping, it, consists, of, two, parts, rotating, on, each, other, about, the, kingbolt, or, perchbolt, above, the, fore, axle, and, beneath, the, body, a, block, of, wood, called, a, headblock, might, be, placed, between, the, fifth, wheel, and, the, forward, spring, originally, the, word, fittings, referred, to, metal, elements, such, as, bolts, and, brackets, furnishings, leaned, more, to, leatherwork, and, upholstery, or, referred, to, metal, buckles, on, harness, and, appointments, were, things, brought, to, a, carriage, but, not, part, of, it, however, all, of, these, words, have, blended, together, over, time, and, are, often, used, interchangeably, to, mean, the, smaller, components, or, parts, of, a, carriage, or, equipment, 7, all, the, shiny, metal, fittings, on, a, vehicle, should, be, one, color, such, as, brass, yellow, or, nickel, white, and, should, match, the, buckle, color, of, any, harness, used, with, the, vehicle, 130, early, bodies, of, horseless, carriages, were, constructed, by, coachmakers, using, the, same, parts, used, in, carriages, and, coaches, and, some, horse, carriage, terminology, has, survived, in, modern, automobiles, we, must, not, forget, that, the, early, railway, carriages, were, basically, mail, coaches, on, iron, wheels, and, the, early, motor, cars, differed, from, the, horse, drawn, wagonette, or, coupe, only, in, so, far, that, there, was, no, horse, tied, to, it, l, szl, tarr, in, the, history, of, the, carriage, 295, the, carriage, driver,
