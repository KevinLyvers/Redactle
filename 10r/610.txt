a, satellite, or, artificial, satellite, is, an, object, typically, a, spacecraft, placed, into, orbit, around, a, celestial, body, satellites, have, a, variety, of, uses, including, communication, relay, weather, forecasting, navigation, gps, broadcasting, scientific, research, and, earth, observation, additional, military, uses, are, reconnaissance, early, warning, signals, intelligence, and, potentially, weapon, delivery, other, satellites, include, the, final, rocket, stages, that, place, satellites, in, orbit, and, formerly, useful, satellites, that, later, become, defunct, except, for, passive, satellites, most, satellites, have, an, electricity, generation, system, for, equipment, on, board, such, as, solar, panels, or, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, rtgs, most, satellites, also, have, a, method, of, communication, to, ground, stations, called, transponders, many, satellites, use, a, standardized, bus, to, save, cost, and, work, the, most, popular, of, which, are, small, cubesats, similar, satellites, can, work, together, as, groups, forming, constellations, because, of, the, high, launch, cost, to, space, most, satellites, are, designed, to, be, as, lightweight, and, robust, as, possible, most, communication, satellites, are, radio, relay, stations, in, orbit, and, carry, dozens, of, transponders, each, with, a, bandwidth, of, tens, of, megahertz, satellites, are, placed, from, the, surface, to, the, orbit, by, launch, vehicles, high, enough, to, avoid, orbital, decay, by, the, atmosphere, satellites, can, then, change, or, maintain, the, orbit, by, propulsion, usually, by, chemical, or, ion, thrusters, as, of, 2018, about, 90, of, the, satellites, orbiting, the, earth, are, in, low, earth, orbit, or, geostationary, orbit, geostationary, means, the, satellites, stay, still, in, the, sky, relative, to, a, fixed, point, on, the, ground, some, imaging, satellites, chose, a, sun, synchronous, orbit, because, they, can, scan, the, entire, globe, with, similar, lighting, as, the, number, of, satellites, and, space, debris, around, earth, increases, the, threat, of, collision, has, become, more, severe, a, small, number, of, satellites, orbit, other, bodies, such, as, the, moon, mars, and, the, sun, or, many, bodies, at, once, two, for, a, halo, orbit, three, for, a, lissajous, orbit, earth, observation, satellites, gather, information, for, reconnaissance, mapping, monitoring, the, weather, ocean, forest, etc, space, telescopes, take, advantage, of, outer, space, s, near, perfect, vacuum, to, observe, objects, with, the, entire, electromagnetic, spectrum, because, satellites, can, see, a, large, portion, of, the, earth, at, once, communications, satellites, can, relay, information, to, remote, places, the, signal, delay, from, satellites, and, their, orbit, s, predictability, are, used, in, satellite, navigation, systems, such, as, gps, space, probes, are, satellites, designed, for, robotic, space, exploration, outside, of, earth, and, space, stations, are, in, essence, crewed, satellites, the, first, artificial, satellite, launched, into, the, earth, s, orbit, was, the, soviet, union, s, sputnik, 1, on, october, 4, 1957, as, of, december, 31, 2022, there, are, 6, 718, operational, satellites, in, the, earth, s, orbit, of, which, 4, 529, belong, to, the, united, states, 3, 996, commercial, 590, belong, to, china, 174, belong, to, russia, and, 1, 425, belong, to, other, nations, the, first, published, mathematical, study, of, the, possibility, of, an, artificial, satellite, was, newton, s, cannonball, a, thought, experiment, by, isaac, newton, to, explain, the, motion, of, natural, satellites, in, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, 1687, the, first, fictional, depiction, of, a, satellite, being, launched, into, orbit, was, a, short, story, by, edward, everett, hale, the, brick, moon, 1869, the, idea, surfaced, again, in, jules, verne, s, the, begum, s, fortune, 1879, in, 1903, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, 1857, 1935, published, exploring, space, using, jet, propulsion, devices, which, was, the, first, academic, treatise, on, the, use, of, rocketry, to, launch, spacecraft, he, calculated, the, orbital, speed, required, for, a, minimal, orbit, and, inferred, that, a, multi, stage, rocket, fueled, by, liquid, propellants, could, achieve, this, herman, poto, nik, explored, the, idea, of, using, orbiting, spacecraft, for, detailed, peaceful, and, military, observation, of, the, ground, in, his, 1928, book, the, problem, of, space, travel, he, described, how, the, special, conditions, of, space, could, be, useful, for, scientific, experiments, the, book, described, geostationary, satellites, first, put, forward, by, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, and, discussed, the, communication, between, them, and, the, ground, using, radio, but, fell, short, with, the, idea, of, using, satellites, for, mass, broadcasting, and, as, telecommunications, relays, in, a, 1945, wireless, world, article, english, science, fiction, writer, arthur, c, clarke, described, in, detail, the, possible, use, of, communications, satellites, for, mass, communications, he, suggested, that, three, geostationary, satellites, would, provide, coverage, over, the, entire, planet, 1, 2, in, may, 1946, the, united, states, air, force, s, project, rand, released, the, preliminary, design, of, an, experimental, world, circling, spaceship, which, stated, a, satellite, vehicle, with, appropriate, instrumentation, can, be, expected, to, be, one, of, the, most, potent, scientific, tools, of, the, twentieth, century, the, united, states, had, been, considering, launching, orbital, satellites, since, 1945, under, the, bureau, of, aeronautics, of, the, united, states, navy, project, rand, eventually, released, the, report, but, considered, the, satellite, to, be, a, tool, for, science, politics, and, propaganda, rather, than, a, potential, military, weapon, in, 1946, american, theoretical, astrophysicist, lyman, spitzer, proposed, an, orbiting, space, telescope, in, february, 1954, project, rand, released, scientific, uses, for, a, satellite, vehicle, by, r, r, carhart, this, expanded, on, potential, scientific, uses, for, satellite, vehicles, and, was, followed, in, june, 1955, with, the, scientific, use, of, an, artificial, satellite, by, h, k, kallmann, and, w, w, kellogg, the, first, artificial, satellite, was, sputnik, 1, launched, by, the, soviet, union, on, 4, october, 1957, under, the, sputnik, program, with, sergei, korolev, as, chief, designer, sputnik, 1, helped, to, identify, the, density, of, high, atmospheric, layers, through, measurement, of, its, orbital, change, and, provided, data, on, radio, signal, distribution, in, the, ionosphere, the, unanticipated, announcement, of, sputnik, 1, s, success, precipitated, the, sputnik, crisis, in, the, united, states, and, ignited, the, so, called, space, race, within, the, cold, war, in, the, context, of, activities, planned, for, the, international, geophysical, year, 1957, 1958, the, white, house, announced, on, 29, july, 1955, that, the, u, s, intended, to, launch, satellites, by, the, spring, of, 1958, this, became, known, as, project, vanguard, on, 31, july, the, soviet, union, announced, its, intention, to, launch, a, satellite, by, the, fall, of, 1957, sputnik, 2, was, launched, on, 3, november, 1957, and, carried, the, first, living, passenger, into, orbit, a, dog, named, laika, in, early, 1955, after, being, pressured, by, the, american, rocket, society, the, national, science, foundation, and, the, international, geophysical, year, the, army, and, navy, worked, on, project, orbiter, with, two, competing, programs, the, army, used, the, jupiter, c, rocket, while, the, civilian, navy, program, used, the, vanguard, rocket, to, launch, a, satellite, explorer, 1, became, the, united, states, first, artificial, satellite, on, 31, january, 1958, the, information, sent, back, from, its, radiation, detector, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, earth, s, van, allen, radiation, belts, the, tiros, 1, spacecraft, launched, on, april, 1, 1960, as, part, of, nasa, s, television, infrared, observation, satellite, tiros, program, sent, back, the, first, television, footage, of, weather, patterns, to, be, taken, from, space, in, june, 1961, three, and, a, half, years, after, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, the, united, states, space, surveillance, network, cataloged, 115, earth, orbiting, satellites, ast, rix, or, a, 1, initially, conceptualized, as, fr, 2, or, fr, 2, is, the, first, french, satellite, it, was, launched, on, 26, november, 1965, by, a, diamant, a, rocket, from, the, ciees, launch, site, at, hammaguir, algeria, with, ast, rix, france, became, the, sixth, country, to, have, an, artificial, satellite, and, the, third, country, to, launch, a, satellite, on, its, own, rocket, france, is, the, third, country, to, launch, a, satellite, on, its, own, rocket, the, ast, rix, on, 26, november, 1965, by, a, diamant, a, rocket, from, the, ciees, launch, site, at, hammaguir, algeria, early, satellites, were, built, to, unique, designs, with, advancements, in, technology, multiple, satellites, began, to, be, built, on, single, model, platforms, called, satellite, buses, the, first, standardized, satellite, bus, design, was, the, hs, 333, geosynchronous, geo, communication, satellite, launched, in, 1972, beginning, in, 1997, freeflyer, is, a, commercial, off, the, shelf, software, application, for, satellite, mission, analysis, design, and, operations, while, canada, was, the, third, country, to, build, a, satellite, which, was, launched, into, space, it, was, launched, aboard, an, american, rocket, from, an, american, spaceport, the, same, goes, for, australia, whose, launch, of, the, first, satellite, involved, a, donated, u, s, redstone, rocket, and, american, support, staff, as, well, as, a, joint, launch, facility, with, the, united, kingdom, the, first, italian, satellite, san, marco, 1, was, launched, on, 15, december, 1964, on, a, u, s, scout, rocket, from, wallops, island, virginia, united, states, with, an, italian, launch, team, trained, by, nasa, in, similar, occasions, almost, all, further, first, national, satellites, were, launched, by, foreign, rockets, after, the, late, 2010s, and, especially, after, the, advent, and, operational, fielding, of, large, satellite, internet, constellations, where, on, orbit, active, satellites, more, than, doubled, over, a, period, of, five, years, the, companies, building, the, constellations, began, to, propose, regular, planned, deorbiting, of, the, older, satellites, that, reached, the, end, of, life, as, a, part, of, the, regulatory, process, of, obtaining, a, launch, license, the, largest, artificial, satellite, ever, is, the, international, space, station, by, the, early, 2000s, and, particularly, after, the, advent, of, cubesats, and, increased, launches, of, microsats, frequently, launched, to, the, lower, altitudes, of, low, earth, orbit, leo, satellites, began, to, more, frequently, be, designed, to, get, destroyed, or, breakup, and, burnup, entirely, in, the, atmosphere, for, example, spacex, starlink, satellites, the, first, large, satellite, internet, constellation, to, exceed, 1000, active, satellites, on, orbit, in, 2020, are, designed, to, be, 100, demisable, and, burn, up, completely, on, their, atmospheric, reentry, at, the, end, of, their, life, or, in, the, event, of, an, early, satellite, failure, in, different, periods, many, countries, such, as, algeria, argentina, australia, austria, brazil, canada, chile, china, denmark, egypt, finland, france, germany, india, iran, israel, italy, japan, kazakhstan, south, korea, malaysia, mexico, the, netherlands, norway, pakistan, poland, russia, saudi, arabia, south, africa, spain, switzerland, thailand, turkey, ukraine, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, had, some, satellites, in, orbit, japan, s, space, agency, jaxa, and, nasa, plan, to, send, a, wooden, satellite, prototype, called, lingosat, into, orbit, in, the, summer, of, 2024, they, have, been, working, on, this, project, for, few, years, and, sent, first, wood, samples, to, the, space, in, 2021, to, test, the, material, s, resilience, to, space, conditions, most, satellites, use, chemical, or, ion, propulsion, to, adjust, or, maintain, their, orbit, 78, coupled, with, reaction, wheels, to, control, their, three, axis, of, rotation, or, attitude, satellites, close, to, earth, are, affected, the, most, by, variations, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, gravitational, field, and, the, sun, s, radiation, pressure, satellites, that, are, further, away, are, affected, more, by, other, bodies, gravitational, field, by, the, moon, and, the, sun, satellites, utilize, ultra, white, reflective, coatings, to, prevent, damage, from, uv, radiation, without, orbit, and, orientation, control, satellites, in, orbit, will, not, be, able, to, communicate, with, ground, stations, on, the, earth, 75, 76, chemical, thrusters, on, satellites, usually, use, monopropellant, one, part, or, bipropellant, two, parts, that, are, hypergolic, hypergolic, means, able, to, combust, spontaneously, when, in, contact, with, each, other, or, to, a, catalyst, the, most, commonly, used, propellant, mixtures, on, satellites, are, hydrazine, based, monopropellants, or, monomethylhydrazine, dinitrogen, tetroxide, bipropellants, ion, thrusters, on, satellites, usually, are, hall, effect, thrusters, which, generate, thrust, by, accelerating, positive, ions, through, a, negatively, charged, grid, ion, propulsion, is, more, efficient, propellant, wise, than, chemical, propulsion, but, its, thrust, is, very, small, around, 0, 5, n, or, 0, 1, lb, f, and, thus, requires, a, longer, burn, time, the, thrusters, usually, use, xenon, because, it, is, inert, can, be, easily, ionized, has, a, high, atomic, mass, and, storable, as, a, high, pressure, liquid, 78, 79, most, satellites, use, solar, panels, to, generate, power, and, a, few, in, deep, space, with, limited, sunlight, use, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, slip, rings, attach, solar, panels, to, the, satellite, the, slip, rings, can, rotate, to, be, perpendicular, with, the, sunlight, and, generate, the, most, power, all, satellites, with, a, solar, panel, must, also, have, batteries, because, sunlight, is, blocked, inside, the, launch, vehicle, and, at, night, the, most, common, types, of, batteries, for, satellites, are, lithium, ion, and, in, the, past, nickel, hydrogen, 88, 89, earth, observation, satellites, are, designed, to, monitor, and, survey, the, earth, called, remote, sensing, most, earth, observation, satellites, are, placed, in, low, earth, orbit, for, a, high, data, resolution, though, some, are, placed, in, a, geostationary, orbit, for, an, uninterrupted, coverage, some, satellites, are, placed, in, a, sun, synchronous, orbit, to, have, consistent, lighting, and, obtain, a, total, view, of, the, earth, depending, on, the, satellites, functions, they, might, have, a, normal, camera, radar, lidar, photometer, or, atmospheric, instruments, earth, observation, satellite, s, data, is, most, used, in, archaeology, cartography, environmental, monitoring, meteorology, and, reconnaissance, applications, as, of, 2021, there, are, over, 950, earth, observation, satellites, with, the, largest, number, of, satellites, operated, with, planet, labs, weather, satellites, monitor, clouds, city, lights, fires, effects, of, pollution, auroras, sand, and, dust, storms, snow, cover, ice, mapping, boundaries, of, ocean, currents, energy, flows, etc, environmental, monitoring, satellites, can, detect, changes, in, the, earth, s, vegetation, atmospheric, trace, gas, content, sea, state, ocean, color, and, ice, fields, by, monitoring, vegetation, changes, over, time, droughts, can, be, monitored, by, comparing, the, current, vegetation, state, to, its, long, term, average, anthropogenic, emissions, can, be, monitored, by, evaluating, data, of, tropospheric, no, 2, and, so, 2, a, communications, satellite, is, an, artificial, satellite, that, relays, and, amplifies, radio, telecommunication, signals, via, a, transponder, it, creates, a, communication, channel, between, a, source, transmitter, and, a, receiver, at, different, locations, on, earth, communications, satellites, are, used, for, television, telephone, radio, internet, and, military, applications, many, communications, satellites, are, in, geostationary, orbit, 22, 236, miles, 35, 785, km, above, the, equator, so, that, the, satellite, appears, stationary, at, the, same, point, in, the, sky, therefore, the, satellite, dish, antennas, of, ground, stations, can, be, aimed, permanently, at, that, spot, and, do, not, have, to, move, to, track, the, satellite, others, form, satellite, constellations, in, low, earth, orbit, where, antennas, on, the, ground, have, to, follow, the, position, of, the, satellites, and, switch, between, satellites, frequently, when, an, earth, observation, satellite, or, a, communications, satellite, is, deployed, for, military, or, intelligence, purposes, it, is, known, as, a, spy, satellite, or, reconnaissance, satellite, their, uses, include, early, missile, warning, nuclear, explosion, detection, electronic, reconnaissance, and, optical, or, radar, imaging, surveillance, navigational, satellites, are, satellites, that, use, radio, time, signals, transmitted, to, enable, mobile, receivers, on, the, ground, to, determine, their, exact, location, the, relatively, clear, line, of, sight, between, the, satellites, and, receivers, on, the, ground, combined, with, ever, improving, electronics, allows, satellite, navigation, systems, to, measure, location, to, accuracies, on, the, order, of, a, few, meters, in, real, time, astronomical, satellites, are, satellites, used, for, observation, of, distant, planets, galaxies, and, other, outer, space, objects, tether, satellites, are, satellites, that, are, connected, to, another, satellite, by, a, thin, cable, called, a, tether, recovery, satellites, are, satellites, that, provide, a, recovery, of, reconnaissance, biological, space, production, and, other, payloads, from, orbit, to, earth, biosatellites, are, satellites, designed, to, carry, living, organisms, generally, for, scientific, experimentation, space, based, solar, power, satellites, are, proposed, satellites, that, would, collect, energy, from, sunlight, and, transmit, it, for, use, on, earth, or, other, places, since, the, mid, 2000s, satellites, have, been, hacked, by, militant, organizations, to, broadcast, propaganda, and, to, pilfer, classified, information, from, military, communication, networks, for, testing, purposes, satellites, in, low, earth, orbit, have, been, destroyed, by, ballistic, missiles, launched, from, the, earth, russia, united, states, china, and, india, have, demonstrated, the, ability, to, eliminate, satellites, in, 2007, the, chinese, military, shot, down, an, aging, weather, satellite, followed, by, the, us, navy, shooting, down, a, defunct, spy, satellite, in, february, 2008, on, 18, november, 2015, after, two, failed, attempts, russia, successfully, carried, out, a, flight, test, of, an, anti, satellite, missile, known, as, nudol, on, 27, march, 2019, india, shot, down, a, live, test, satellite, at, 300, km, altitude, in, 3, minutes, becoming, the, fourth, country, to, have, the, capability, to, destroy, live, satellites, the, environmental, impact, of, satellites, is, not, currently, well, understood, as, they, were, previously, assumed, to, be, benign, due, to, the, rarity, of, satellite, launches, however, the, exponential, increase, and, projected, growth, of, satellite, launches, are, bringing, the, issue, into, consideration, the, main, issues, are, resource, use, and, the, release, of, pollutants, into, the, atmosphere, which, can, happen, at, different, stages, of, a, satellite, s, lifetime, resource, use, is, difficult, to, monitor, and, quantify, for, satellites, and, launch, vehicles, due, to, their, commercially, sensitive, nature, however, aluminium, is, a, preferred, metal, in, satellite, construction, due, to, its, lightweight, and, relative, cheapness, and, typically, constitutes, around, 40, of, a, satellite, s, mass, through, mining, and, refining, aluminium, has, numerous, negative, environmental, impacts, and, is, one, of, the, most, carbon, intensive, metals, satellite, manufacturing, also, requires, rare, elements, such, as, lithium, gold, and, gallium, some, of, which, have, significant, environmental, consequences, linked, to, their, mining, and, processing, and, or, are, in, limited, supply, launch, vehicles, require, larger, amounts, of, raw, materials, to, manufacture, and, the, booster, stages, are, usually, dropped, into, the, ocean, after, fuel, exhaustion, they, are, not, normally, recovered, two, empty, boosters, used, for, ariane, 5, which, were, composed, mainly, of, steel, weighed, around, 38, tons, each, to, give, an, idea, of, the, quantity, of, materials, that, are, often, left, in, the, ocean, rocket, launches, release, numerous, pollutants, into, every, layer, of, the, atmosphere, especially, affecting, the, atmosphere, above, the, tropopause, where, the, byproducts, of, combustion, can, reside, for, extended, periods, these, pollutants, can, include, black, carbon, co, 2, nitrogen, oxides, no, x, aluminium, and, water, vapour, but, the, mix, of, pollutants, is, dependent, on, rocket, design, and, fuel, type, the, amount, of, green, house, gases, emitted, by, rockets, is, considered, trivial, as, it, contributes, significantly, less, around, 0, 01, than, the, aviation, industry, yearly, which, itself, accounts, for, 2, 3, of, the, total, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, rocket, emissions, in, the, stratosphere, and, their, effects, are, only, beginning, to, be, studied, and, it, is, likely, that, the, impacts, will, be, more, critical, than, emissions, in, the, troposphere, the, stratosphere, includes, the, ozone, layer, and, pollutants, emitted, from, rockets, can, contribute, to, ozone, depletion, in, a, number, of, ways, radicals, such, as, no, x, ho, x, and, clo, x, deplete, stratospheric, o, 3, through, intermolecular, reactions, and, can, have, huge, impacts, in, trace, amounts, however, it, is, currently, understood, that, launch, rates, would, need, to, increase, by, ten, times, to, match, the, impact, of, regulated, ozone, depleting, substances, whilst, emissions, of, water, vapour, are, largely, deemed, as, inert, h, 2, o, is, the, source, gas, for, ho, x, and, can, also, contribute, to, ozone, loss, through, the, formation, of, ice, particles, black, carbon, particles, emitted, by, rockets, can, absorb, solar, radiation, in, the, stratosphere, and, cause, warming, in, the, surrounding, air, which, can, then, impact, the, circulatory, dynamics, of, the, stratosphere, both, warming, and, changes, in, circulation, can, then, cause, depletion, of, the, ozone, layer, several, pollutants, are, released, in, the, upper, atmospheric, layers, during, the, orbital, lifetime, of, leo, satellites, orbital, decay, is, caused, by, atmospheric, drag, and, to, keep, the, satellite, in, the, correct, orbit, the, platform, occasionally, needs, repositioning, to, do, this, nozzle, based, systems, use, a, chemical, propellant, to, create, thrust, in, most, cases, hydrazine, is, the, chemical, propellant, used, which, then, releases, ammonia, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, as, gas, into, the, upper, atmosphere, also, the, environment, of, the, outer, atmosphere, causes, the, degradation, of, exterior, materials, the, atomic, oxygen, in, the, upper, atmosphere, oxidises, hydrocarbon, based, polymers, like, kapton, teflon, and, mylar, that, are, used, to, insulate, and, protect, the, satellite, which, then, emits, gasses, like, co, 2, and, co, into, the, atmosphere, given, the, current, surge, in, satellites, in, the, sky, soon, hundreds, of, satellites, may, be, clearly, visible, to, the, human, eye, at, dark, sites, it, is, estimated, that, the, overall, levels, of, diffuse, brightness, of, the, night, skies, has, increased, by, up, to, 10, above, natural, levels, this, has, the, potential, to, confuse, organisms, like, insects, and, night, migrating, birds, that, use, celestial, patterns, for, migration, and, orientation, the, impact, this, might, have, is, currently, unclear, the, visibility, of, man, made, objects, in, the, night, sky, may, also, impact, people, s, linkages, with, the, world, nature, and, culture, at, all, points, of, a, satellite, s, lifetime, its, movement, and, processes, are, monitored, on, the, ground, through, a, network, of, facilities, the, environmental, cost, of, the, infrastructure, as, well, as, day, to, day, operations, is, likely, to, be, quite, high, but, quantification, requires, further, investigation, when, satellites, reach, the, end, of, life, they, are, intentionally, deorbited, or, moved, to, a, graveyard, orbit, further, away, from, earth, in, order, to, reduce, space, debris, physical, collection, or, removal, is, not, economical, or, even, currently, possible, moving, satellites, out, to, a, graveyard, orbit, is, also, unsustainable, because, they, remain, there, for, hundreds, of, years, it, will, lead, to, the, further, pollution, of, space, and, future, issues, with, space, debris, when, satellites, deorbit, much, of, it, is, destroyed, during, re, entry, into, the, atmosphere, due, to, the, heat, this, introduces, more, material, and, pollutants, into, the, atmosphere, there, have, been, concerns, expressed, about, the, potential, damage, to, the, ozone, layer, and, the, possibility, of, increasing, the, earth, s, albedo, reducing, warming, but, also, resulting, in, accidental, geoengineering, of, the, earth, s, climate, after, deorbiting, 70, of, satellites, end, up, in, the, ocean, and, are, rarely, recovered, issues, like, space, debris, radio, and, light, pollution, are, increasing, in, magnitude, and, at, the, same, time, lack, progress, in, national, or, international, regulation, space, debris, pose, dangers, to, the, spacecraft, including, satellites, in, or, crossing, geocentric, orbits, and, have, the, potential, to, drive, a, kessler, syndrome, which, could, potentially, curtail, humanity, from, conducting, space, endeavors, in, the, future, with, increase, in, the, number, of, satellite, constellations, like, spacex, starlink, the, astronomical, community, such, as, the, iau, report, that, orbital, pollution, is, getting, increased, significantly, a, report, from, the, satcon1, workshop, in, 2020, concluded, that, the, effects, of, large, satellite, constellations, can, severely, affect, some, astronomical, research, efforts, and, lists, six, ways, to, mitigate, harm, to, astronomy, the, iau, is, establishing, a, center, cps, to, coordinate, or, aggregate, measures, to, mitigate, such, detrimental, effects, some, notable, satellite, failures, that, polluted, and, dispersed, radioactive, materials, are, kosmos, 954, kosmos, 1402, and, the, transit, 5, bn, 3, generally, liability, has, been, covered, by, the, liability, convention, using, wood, as, an, alternative, material, has, been, posited, in, order, to, reduce, pollution, and, debris, from, satellites, that, reenter, the, atmosphere, due, to, the, low, received, signal, strength, of, satellite, transmissions, they, are, prone, to, jamming, by, land, based, transmitters, such, jamming, is, limited, to, the, geographical, area, within, the, transmitter, s, range, gps, satellites, are, potential, targets, for, jamming, but, satellite, phone, and, television, signals, have, also, been, subjected, to, jamming, also, it, is, very, easy, to, transmit, a, carrier, radio, signal, to, a, geostationary, satellite, and, thus, interfere, with, the, legitimate, uses, of, the, satellite, s, transponder, it, is, common, for, earth, stations, to, transmit, at, the, wrong, time, or, on, the, wrong, frequency, in, commercial, satellite, space, and, dual, illuminate, the, transponder, rendering, the, frequency, unusable, satellite, operators, now, have, sophisticated, monitoring, tools, and, methods, that, enable, them, to, pinpoint, the, source, of, any, carrier, and, manage, the, transponder, space, effectively
