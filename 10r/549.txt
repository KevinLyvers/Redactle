a, chemical, weapon, cw, is, a, specialized, munition, that, uses, chemicals, formulated, to, inflict, death, or, harm, on, humans, according, to, the, organisation, for, the, prohibition, of, chemical, weapons, opcw, this, can, be, any, chemical, compound, intended, as, a, weapon, or, its, precursor, that, can, cause, death, injury, temporary, incapacitation, or, sensory, irritation, through, its, chemical, action, munitions, or, other, delivery, devices, designed, to, deliver, chemical, weapons, whether, filled, or, unfilled, are, also, considered, weapons, themselves, chemical, weapons, are, classified, as, weapons, of, mass, destruction, wmd, though, they, are, distinct, from, nuclear, weapons, biological, weapons, and, radiological, weapons, all, may, be, used, in, warfare, and, are, known, by, the, military, acronym, nbc, for, nuclear, biological, and, chemical, warfare, weapons, of, mass, destruction, are, distinct, from, conventional, weapons, which, are, primarily, effective, due, to, their, explosive, kinetic, or, incendiary, potential, chemical, weapons, can, be, widely, dispersed, in, gas, liquid, and, solid, forms, and, may, easily, afflict, others, than, the, intended, targets, nerve, gas, tear, gas, and, pepper, spray, are, three, modern, examples, of, chemical, weapons, lethal, unitary, chemical, agents, and, munitions, are, extremely, volatile, and, they, constitute, a, class, of, hazardous, chemical, weapons, that, have, been, stockpiled, by, many, nations, unitary, agents, are, effective, on, their, own, and, do, not, require, mixing, with, other, agents, the, most, dangerous, of, these, are, nerve, agents, ga, gb, gd, and, vx, and, vesicant, blister, agents, which, include, formulations, of, sulfur, mustard, such, as, h, ht, and, hd, they, all, are, liquids, at, normal, room, temperature, but, become, gaseous, when, released, widely, used, during, the, world, war, i, the, effects, of, so, called, mustard, gas, phosgene, gas, and, others, caused, lung, searing, blindness, death, and, maiming, during, world, war, ii, the, nazi, regime, used, a, commercial, hydrogen, cyanide, blood, agent, trade, named, zyklon, b, to, commit, industrialised, genocide, against, jews, and, other, targeted, populations, in, large, gas, chambers, the, holocaust, resulted, in, the, largest, death, toll, to, chemical, weapons, in, history, as, of, 2016, cs, gas, and, pepper, spray, remain, in, common, use, for, policing, and, riot, control, cs, and, pepper, spray, are, considered, non, lethal, weapons, under, the, chemical, weapons, convention, 1993, there, is, a, legally, binding, worldwide, ban, on, the, production, stockpiling, and, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, their, precursors, however, large, stockpiles, of, chemical, weapons, continue, to, exist, usually, justified, as, a, precaution, against, possible, use, by, an, aggressor, continued, storage, of, these, chemical, weapons, is, a, hazard, as, many, of, the, weapons, are, now, more, than, 50, years, old, raising, risks, significantly, the, united, states, is, now, undergoing, measures, to, dispose, of, their, chemical, weapons, in, a, safe, manner, chemical, warfare, involves, using, the, toxic, properties, of, chemical, substances, as, weapons, this, type, of, warfare, is, distinct, from, nuclear, warfare, and, biological, warfare, which, together, make, up, nbc, the, military, initialism, for, nuclear, biological, and, chemical, warfare, or, weapons, none, of, these, fall, under, the, term, conventional, weapons, which, are, primarily, effective, because, of, their, destructive, potential, chemical, warfare, does, not, depend, upon, explosive, force, to, achieve, an, objective, it, depends, upon, the, unique, properties, of, the, chemical, agent, weaponized, a, lethal, agent, is, designed, to, injure, incapacitate, or, kill, an, opposing, force, or, deny, unhindered, use, of, a, particular, area, of, terrain, defoliants, are, used, to, quickly, kill, vegetation, and, deny, its, use, for, cover, and, concealment, chemical, warfare, can, also, be, used, against, agriculture, and, livestock, to, promote, hunger, and, starvation, chemical, payloads, can, be, delivered, by, remote, controlled, container, release, aircraft, or, rocket, protection, against, chemical, weapons, includes, proper, equipment, training, and, decontamination, measures, simple, chemical, weapons, were, used, sporadically, throughout, antiquity, and, into, the, industrial, age, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, century, that, the, modern, conception, of, chemical, warfare, emerged, as, various, scientists, and, nations, proposed, the, use, of, asphyxiating, or, poisonous, gases, so, alarmed, were, nations, that, multiple, international, treaties, discussed, below, were, passed, banning, chemical, weapons, this, however, did, not, prevent, the, extensive, use, of, chemical, weapons, in, world, war, i, the, development, of, chlorine, gas, among, others, was, used, by, both, sides, to, try, to, break, the, stalemate, of, trench, warfare, though, largely, ineffective, over, the, long, run, it, decidedly, changed, the, nature, of, the, war, in, many, cases, the, gases, used, did, not, kill, but, instead, horribly, maimed, injured, or, disfigured, casualties, some, 1, 3, million, gas, casualties, were, recorded, which, may, have, included, up, to, 260, 000, civilian, casualties, the, interwar, period, saw, occasional, use, of, chemical, weapons, mainly, by, multiple, european, colonial, forces, to, put, down, rebellions, the, italians, also, used, poison, gas, during, their, 1936, invasion, of, ethiopia, in, nazi, germany, much, research, went, into, developing, new, chemical, weapons, such, as, potent, nerve, agents, however, chemical, weapons, saw, little, battlefield, use, in, world, war, ii, both, sides, were, prepared, to, use, such, weapons, but, the, allied, powers, never, did, and, the, axis, used, them, only, very, sparingly, the, reason, for, the, lack, of, use, by, the, nazis, despite, the, considerable, efforts, that, had, gone, into, developing, new, varieties, might, have, been, a, lack, of, technical, ability, or, fears, that, the, allies, would, retaliate, with, their, own, chemical, weapons, those, fears, were, not, unfounded, the, allies, made, comprehensive, plans, for, defensive, and, retaliatory, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, stockpiled, large, quantities, japanese, forces, used, them, more, widely, though, only, against, their, asian, enemies, as, they, also, feared, that, using, it, on, western, powers, would, result, in, retaliation, chemical, weapons, were, frequently, used, against, kuomintang, and, chinese, communist, troops, however, the, nazis, did, extensively, use, poison, gas, against, civilians, in, the, holocaust, vast, quantities, of, zyklon, b, gas, and, carbon, monoxide, were, used, in, the, gas, chambers, of, nazi, extermination, camps, resulting, in, the, overwhelming, majority, of, some, three, million, deaths, this, remains, the, deadliest, use, of, poison, gas, in, history, the, post, war, era, has, seen, limited, though, devastating, use, of, chemical, weapons, some, 100, 000, iranian, troops, were, casualties, of, iraqi, chemical, weapons, during, the, iran, iraq, war, iraq, used, mustard, gas, and, nerve, agents, against, its, own, civilians, in, the, 1988, halabja, chemical, attack, the, cuban, intervention, in, angola, saw, limited, use, of, organophosphates, the, syrian, government, has, used, sarin, chlorine, and, mustard, gas, in, the, syrian, civil, war, generally, against, civilians, terrorist, groups, have, also, used, chemical, weapons, notably, in, the, tokyo, subway, sarin, attack, and, the, matsumoto, incident, see, also, chemical, terrorism, international, law, has, prohibited, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, since, 1899, under, the, hague, convention, article, 23, of, the, regulations, respecting, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, adopted, by, the, first, hague, conference, especially, prohibited, employing, poison, and, poisoned, arms, a, separate, declaration, stated, that, in, any, war, between, signatory, powers, the, parties, would, abstain, from, using, projectiles, the, object, of, which, is, the, diffusion, of, asphyxiating, or, deleterious, gases, the, washington, naval, treaty, signed, february, 6, 1922, also, known, as, the, five, power, treaty, aimed, at, banning, chemical, warfare, but, did, not, succeed, because, france, rejected, it, the, subsequent, failure, to, include, chemical, warfare, has, contributed, to, the, resultant, increase, in, stockpiles, the, geneva, protocol, officially, known, as, the, protocol, for, the, prohibition, of, the, use, in, war, of, asphyxiating, poisonous, or, other, gases, and, of, bacteriological, methods, of, warfare, is, an, international, treaty, prohibiting, the, use, of, chemical, and, biological, weapons, in, international, armed, conflicts, it, was, signed, at, geneva, june, 17, 1925, and, entered, into, force, on, february, 8, 1928, 133, nations, are, listed, as, state, parties, to, the, treaty, ukraine, is, the, newest, signatory, acceding, august, 7, 2003, this, treaty, states, that, chemical, and, biological, weapons, are, justly, condemned, by, the, general, opinion, of, the, civilised, world, and, while, the, treaty, prohibits, the, use, of, chemical, and, biological, weapons, it, does, not, address, the, production, storage, or, transfer, of, these, weapons, treaties, that, followed, the, geneva, protocol, did, address, those, omissions, and, have, been, enacted, the, 1993, chemical, weapons, convention, cwc, is, the, most, recent, arms, control, agreement, with, the, force, of, international, law, its, full, name, is, the, convention, on, the, prohibition, of, the, development, production, stockpiling, and, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, on, their, destruction, that, agreement, outlaws, the, production, stockpiling, and, use, of, chemical, weapons, it, is, administered, by, the, organisation, for, the, prohibition, of, chemical, weapons, opcw, which, is, an, independent, organization, based, in, the, hague, the, opcw, administers, the, terms, of, the, cwc, to, 192, signatories, which, represents, 98, of, the, global, population, as, of, june, 2016, 66, 368, of, 72, 525, metric, tonnes, 92, of, chemical, weapon, stockpiles, have, been, verified, as, destroyed, the, opcw, has, conducted, 6, 327, inspections, at, 235, chemical, weapon, related, sites, and, 2, 255, industrial, sites, these, inspections, have, affected, the, sovereign, territory, of, 86, states, parties, since, april, 1997, worldwide, 4, 732, industrial, facilities, are, subject, to, inspection, under, provisions, of, the, cwc, in, 1985, the, united, states, congress, passed, legislation, requiring, the, disposal, of, the, stockpile, chemical, agents, and, munitions, consisting, of, over, 3, million, chemical, weapons, adding, up, to, 31, 000, tons, of, chemical, weapons, needing, to, be, disposed, of, this, was, ordered, because, a, timely, and, safe, disposal, of, chemical, weapons, is, far, safer, than, chemical, weapon, storage, between, the, years, of, 1982, and, 1992, the, united, states, army, reported, approximately, 1, 500, leaking, chemical, weapons, munitions, and, in, 1993, a, 100, gallon, chemical, spill, was, reported, at, the, tooele, army, depot, in, utah, consisting, of, mustard, agents, chemical, decomposition, in, soil, is, affected, by, many, factors, such, as, temperature, acidity, alkalinity, meteorological, conditions, and, the, types, of, organisms, present, in, the, soil, making, it, difficult, to, assess, and, predict, safety, spills, of, persistent, agents, such, as, sulfur, mustards, can, remain, harmful, for, decades, there, are, three, basic, configurations, in, which, these, agents, are, stored, the, first, are, self, contained, munitions, like, projectiles, cartridges, mines, and, rockets, these, can, contain, propellant, or, explosive, components, the, next, form, are, aircraft, delivered, munitions, together, they, constitute, the, two, forms, that, have, been, weaponized, and, are, ready, for, their, intended, use, the, u, s, stockpile, consisted, of, 39, of, these, weapon, ready, munitions, the, final, of, the, three, forms, is, raw, agent, housed, in, bulk, containers, the, remaining, 61, of, the, us, stockpile, was, stored, in, this, manner, whereas, these, chemicals, exist, in, liquid, form, at, normal, room, temperature, the, sulfur, mustards, h, and, hd, freeze, in, temperatures, below, 55, f, 12, 8, c, mixing, lewisite, with, distilled, mustard, lowers, the, freezing, point, to, 13, f, 25, 0, c, higher, temperatures, are, a, bigger, concern, because, the, possibility, of, an, explosion, increases, as, the, temperatures, rise, a, fire, at, one, of, these, facilities, would, endanger, the, surrounding, community, as, well, as, the, personnel, at, the, installations, perhaps, more, so, for, the, community, having, much, less, access, to, protective, equipment, and, specialized, training, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, conducted, a, study, to, assess, capabilities, and, costs, for, protecting, civilian, populations, during, related, emergencies, and, the, effectiveness, of, expedient, in, place, shelters, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, allies, occupied, germany, and, found, large, stockpiles, of, chemical, weapons, that, they, did, not, know, how, to, dispose, of, or, deal, with, ultimately, the, allies, disposed, large, quantities, of, these, chemical, weapons, into, the, baltic, sea, including, 32, 000, tonnes, of, chemical, munitions, and, chemical, warfare, agents, dumped, into, the, bornholm, basin, and, another, 2000, tonnes, of, chemical, weapons, in, the, gotland, basin, the, majority, of, these, chemical, munitions, were, dumped, into, the, sea, while, contained, in, simple, wooden, crates, leading, to, a, rapid, proliferation, of, chemicals, chemical, weapons, being, disposed, in, the, ocean, during, the, 20th, century, is, not, unique, to, the, baltic, sea, and, other, heavily, contaminated, areas, where, disposal, occurred, are, the, european, japanese, russian, and, united, states, coasts, these, chemical, weapons, dumped, in, the, ocean, pose, a, continual, environmental, and, human, health, risk, and, chemical, agents, and, breakdown, products, from, said, agents, have, been, recently, been, identified, in, ocean, sediment, near, historical, dumping, sites, when, chemical, weapons, are, dumped, or, otherwise, improperly, disposed, of, the, chemical, agents, are, quickly, distributed, over, a, wide, range, the, long, term, impacts, of, this, wide, scale, distribution, are, unknown, but, known, to, be, negative, in, the, vietnam, war, of, 1955, 1975, a, chemical, weapon, called, agent, orange, was, widely, used, by, united, states, forces, the, united, states, utilized, agent, orange, as, a, type, of, tactical, herbicide, aiming, to, destroy, vietnamese, foliage, and, plant, life, to, ease, military, access, this, usage, of, agent, orange, has, left, lasting, impacts, that, are, still, observable, today, in, the, vietnamese, environment, causing, disease, stunted, growth, and, deformities, the, stockpiles, which, have, been, maintained, for, more, than, 50, years, are, now, considered, obsolete, public, law, 99, 145, contains, section, 1412, which, directs, the, department, of, defense, dod, to, dispose, of, the, stockpiles, this, directive, fell, upon, the, dod, with, joint, cooperation, from, the, federal, emergency, management, agency, fema, the, congressional, directive, has, resulted, in, the, present, chemical, stockpile, disposal, program, historically, chemical, munitions, have, been, disposed, of, by, land, burial, open, burning, and, ocean, dumping, referred, to, as, operation, chase, however, in, 1969, the, national, research, council, nrc, recommended, that, ocean, dumping, be, discontinued, the, army, then, began, a, study, of, disposal, technologies, including, the, assessment, of, incineration, as, well, as, chemical, neutralization, methods, in, 1982, that, study, culminated, in, the, selection, of, incineration, technology, which, is, now, incorporated, into, what, is, known, as, the, baseline, system, construction, of, the, johnston, atoll, chemical, agent, disposal, system, jacads, began, in, 1985, this, was, to, be, a, full, scale, prototype, facility, using, the, baseline, system, the, prototype, was, a, success, but, there, were, still, many, concerns, about, conus, operations, to, address, growing, public, concern, over, incineration, congress, in, 1992, directed, the, army, to, evaluate, alternative, disposal, approaches, that, might, be, significantly, safer, more, cost, effective, and, which, could, be, completed, within, the, established, time, frame, the, army, was, directed, to, report, to, congress, on, potential, alternative, technologies, by, the, end, of, 1993, and, to, include, in, that, report, any, recommendations, that, the, national, academy, of, sciences, makes, in, june, 2007, the, disposal, program, achieved, the, milestone, of, reaching, 45, destruction, of, the, chemical, weapon, stockpile, the, chemical, materials, agency, cma, releases, regular, updates, to, the, public, regarding, the, status, of, the, disposal, program, on, july, 7, 2023, the, program, completed, destruction, of, all, declared, chemical, weapons, chemical, weapons, are, said, to, make, deliberate, use, of, the, toxic, properties, of, chemical, substances, to, inflict, death, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, it, was, widely, reported, in, newspapers, that, entire, regions, of, europe, would, be, turned, into, lifeless, wastelands, however, chemical, weapons, were, not, used, to, the, extent, predicted, by, the, press, an, unintended, chemical, weapon, release, occurred, at, the, port, of, bari, a, german, attack, on, the, evening, of, december, 2, 1943, damaged, u, s, vessels, in, the, harbour, and, the, resultant, release, from, their, hulls, of, mustard, gas, inflicted, a, total, of, 628, casualties, the, u, s, government, was, highly, criticized, for, exposing, american, service, members, to, chemical, agents, while, testing, the, effects, of, exposure, these, tests, were, often, performed, without, the, consent, or, prior, knowledge, of, the, soldiers, affected, australian, service, personnel, were, also, exposed, as, a, result, of, the, brook, island, trials, carried, out, by, the, british, government, to, determine, the, likely, consequences, of, chemical, warfare, in, tropical, conditions, little, was, known, of, such, possibilities, at, that, time, some, chemical, agents, are, designed, to, produce, mind, altering, changes, rendering, the, victim, unable, to, perform, their, assigned, mission, these, are, classified, as, incapacitating, agents, and, lethality, is, not, a, factor, of, their, effectiveness, binary, munitions, contain, two, unmixed, and, isolated, chemicals, that, do, not, react, to, produce, lethal, effects, until, mixed, this, usually, happens, just, prior, to, battlefield, use, in, contrast, unitary, weapons, are, lethal, chemical, munitions, that, produce, a, toxic, result, in, their, existing, state, the, majority, of, the, chemical, weapon, stockpile, is, unitary, and, most, of, it, is, stored, in, one, ton, bulk, containers
