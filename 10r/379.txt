caliper, s, or, calliper, s, are, an, instrument, used, to, measure, the, linear, dimensions, of, an, object, or, hole, namely, the, length, width, thickness, diameter, or, depth, of, an, object, or, hole, the, word, caliper, comes, from, a, corrupt, form, of, caliber, many, types, of, calipers, permit, reading, out, a, measurement, on, a, ruled, scale, a, dial, or, an, electronic, digital, display, a, common, association, is, to, calipers, using, a, sliding, vernier, scale, some, calipers, can, be, as, simple, as, a, compass, with, inward, or, outward, facing, points, but, with, no, scale, measurement, indication, the, tips, of, the, caliper, are, adjusted, to, fit, across, the, points, to, be, measured, and, then, kept, at, that, span, while, moved, to, separate, measuring, device, such, as, a, ruler, calipers, are, used, in, many, fields, such, as, mechanical, engineering, metalworking, forestry, woodworking, science, and, medicine, caliper, is, the, american, spelling, while, calliper, double, l, is, the, british, spelling, a, single, tool, might, be, referred, to, as, a, caliper, or, as, calipers, a, plural, only, plurale, tantum, form, like, scissors, or, glasses, colloquially, the, phrase, pair, of, verniers, or, just, vernier, might, refer, to, a, vernier, caliper, in, loose, colloquial, usage, these, phrases, may, also, refer, to, other, kinds, of, calipers, although, they, involve, no, vernier, scale, in, machine, shop, usage, the, term, caliper, is, often, used, in, contradistinction, to, micrometer, even, though, outside, micrometers, are, technically, a, form, of, caliper, in, this, usage, caliper, implies, only, the, form, factor, of, the, instrument, the, earliest, caliper, has, been, found, in, the, greek, giglio, wreck, near, the, italian, coast, the, ship, s, find, dates, to, the, 6th, century, bc, the, wooden, piece, already, featured, a, fixed, and, a, movable, jaw, although, rare, finds, calipers, remained, in, use, by, the, greeks, and, romans, a, bronze, caliper, dating, from, 9, ad, was, used, for, minute, measurements, during, the, chinese, xin, dynasty, the, caliper, had, an, inscription, stating, that, it, was, made, on, the, gui, you, day, the, first, day, of, the, first, month, of, the, first, year, of, shijianguo, the, calipers, included, a, slot, and, pin, and, graduated, in, inches, and, tenths, of, an, inch, the, modern, vernier, caliper, was, invented, by, pierre, vernier, as, an, improvement, of, the, nonius, of, pedro, nunes, inside, calipers, are, used, to, measure, the, internal, size, of, an, object, outside, calipers, are, used, to, measure, the, external, size, of, an, object, the, same, observations, and, technique, apply, to, this, type, of, caliper, as, for, the, inside, caliper, with, some, understanding, of, their, limitations, and, usage, these, instruments, can, provide, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, and, repeatability, they, are, especially, useful, when, measuring, over, very, large, distances, consider, if, the, calipers, are, used, to, measure, a, large, diameter, pipe, a, vernier, caliper, does, not, have, the, depth, capacity, to, straddle, this, large, diameter, and, at, the, same, time, reach, the, outermost, points, of, the, pipe, s, diameter, they, are, made, from, high, carbon, steel, in, the, metalworking, field, a, divider, caliper, popularly, called, a, compass, is, used, to, mark, out, locations, the, points, are, sharpened, so, that, they, act, as, scribers, one, leg, can, then, be, placed, in, the, dimple, created, by, a, center, or, prick, punch, and, the, other, leg, pivoted, so, that, it, scribes, a, line, on, the, workpiece, s, surface, thus, forming, an, arc, or, circle, their, namesake, use, is, in, dividing, a, workpiece, of, arbitrary, width, into, equal, width, sections, by, walking, the, tool, from, one, end, to, the, other, by, pivoting, it, from, one, point, to, the, next, until, reaching, the, other, end, then, adjusting, the, gap, between, the, points, until, the, walk, ends, directly, on, the, end, point, equal, divisions, can, be, easily, marked, out, without, any, measuring, a, divider, caliper, is, also, used, to, measure, a, distance, between, two, points, on, a, map, the, two, caliper, ends, are, brought, to, the, two, points, whose, distance, is, being, measured, the, caliper, s, opening, is, then, either, measured, on, a, separate, ruler, and, then, converted, to, the, actual, distance, or, measured, directly, on, a, scale, drawn, on, the, map, on, a, nautical, chart, the, distance, is, often, measured, on, the, latitude, scale, appearing, on, the, sides, of, the, map, one, minute, of, arc, along, any, great, circle, e, g, any, longitude, meridian, is, approximately, one, nautical, mile, or, 1852, meters, dividers, are, also, used, in, the, medical, profession, an, ecg, also, ekg, caliper, transfers, distance, on, an, electrocardiogram, in, conjunction, with, the, appropriate, scale, the, heart, rate, can, be, determined, a, pocket, caliper, version, was, invented, by, cardiologist, robert, a, mackin, oddleg, calipers, hermaphrodite, calipers, or, oddleg, jennys, as, pictured, on, the, left, are, generally, used, to, scribe, a, line, at, a, set, distance, from, the, edge, of, a, workpiece, the, bent, leg, is, used, to, run, along, the, workpiece, edge, while, the, scriber, makes, its, mark, at, a, predetermined, distance, this, ensures, a, line, parallel, to, the, edge, in, the, diagram, at, left, the, uppermost, caliper, has, a, slight, shoulder, in, the, bent, leg, allowing, it, to, sit, on, the, edge, more, securely, the, lower, caliper, lacks, this, feature, but, has, a, renewable, scriber, that, can, be, adjusted, for, wear, as, well, as, being, replaced, when, excessively, worn, the, labelled, parts, are, the, calipers, in, the, diagram, show, a, primary, reading, on, the, metric, scale, of, about, 2, 475, cm, 2, 4, cm, read, from, the, main, scale, plus, about, 0, 075, cm, from, the, vernier, scale, calipers, often, have, a, zero, point, error, meaning, that, the, calipers, do, not, read, 0, 000, cm, when, the, jaws, are, closed, the, zero, point, error, must, always, be, subtracted, from, the, primary, reading, let, us, assume, these, calipers, have, a, zero, point, error, of, 0, 013, cm, this, would, give, us, a, length, reading, of, 2, 462, cm, for, any, measurement, reporting, the, error, on, the, measurement, is, also, important, ignoring, the, possibility, of, interpolation, by, eye, both, the, primary, reading, and, the, zero, point, reading, are, bounded, by, plus, minus, half, the, length, corresponding, to, the, width, of, the, smallest, interval, on, the, vernier, scale, 0, 0025, cm, these, are, absolute, errors, and, absolute, errors, add, so, the, length, reading, is, then, bounded, by, plus, minus, the, length, corresponding, to, the, full, width, of, the, smallest, interval, on, the, vernier, scale, 0, 005, cm, assuming, no, systematics, affect, the, measurement, the, instrument, works, perfectly, a, complete, measurement, would, then, read, 2, 462, cm, 0, 005, cm, the, vernier, dial, and, digital, calipers, directly, read, the, distance, measured, with, high, accuracy, and, precision, they, are, functionally, identical, with, different, ways, of, reading, the, result, these, calipers, comprise, a, calibrated, scale, with, a, fixed, jaw, and, another, jaw, with, a, pointer, that, slides, along, the, scale, the, distance, between, the, jaws, is, then, read, in, different, ways, for, the, three, types, the, simplest, method, is, to, read, the, position, of, the, pointer, directly, on, the, scale, when, the, pointer, is, between, two, markings, the, user, can, mentally, interpolate, to, improve, the, precision, of, the, reading, this, would, be, a, simply, calibrated, caliper, but, the, addition, of, a, vernier, scale, allows, more, accurate, interpolation, and, is, the, universal, practice, this, is, the, vernier, caliper, vernier, dial, and, digital, calipers, can, measure, internal, dimensions, using, the, uppermost, jaws, in, the, picture, at, right, external, dimensions, using, the, pictured, lower, jaws, and, in, many, cases, depth, by, the, use, of, a, probe, that, is, attached, to, the, movable, head, and, slides, along, the, centre, of, the, body, this, probe, is, slender, and, can, get, into, deep, grooves, that, may, prove, difficult, for, other, measuring, tools, the, vernier, scales, may, include, metric, measurements, on, the, lower, part, of, the, scale, and, inch, measurements, on, the, upper, or, vice, versa, in, countries, that, use, inches, vernier, calipers, commonly, used, in, industry, provide, a, precision, to, 0, 01, mm, 10, micrometres, or, one, thousandth, of, an, inch, they, are, available, in, sizes, that, can, measure, up, to, 1828, mm, 72, in, instead, of, using, a, vernier, mechanism, which, requires, some, practice, to, use, the, dial, caliper, reads, the, final, fraction, of, a, millimeter, or, inch, on, a, simple, dial, in, this, instrument, a, small, precise, rack, and, pinion, drives, a, pointer, on, a, circular, dial, allowing, direct, reading, without, the, need, to, read, a, vernier, scale, typically, the, pointer, rotates, once, every, inch, tenth, of, an, inch, or, 1, millimeter, this, measurement, must, be, added, to, the, coarse, whole, inches, or, centimeters, read, from, the, slide, the, dial, is, usually, arranged, to, be, rotatable, beneath, the, pointer, allowing, for, differential, measurements, the, measuring, of, the, difference, in, size, between, two, objects, or, the, setting, of, the, dial, using, a, master, object, and, subsequently, being, able, to, read, directly, the, plus, or, minus, variance, in, the, size, of, subsequent, objects, relative, to, the, master, object, the, slide, of, a, dial, caliper, can, usually, be, locked, at, a, setting, using, a, small, lever, or, screw, this, allows, simple, go, no, go, checks, of, part, sizes, rather, than, a, rack, and, pinion, digital, calipers, use, a, linear, encoder, a, liquid, crystal, display, shows, the, measurement, which, often, can, switch, units, between, millimeters, and, fractional, or, decimal, inches, all, provide, for, zeroing, the, display, at, any, point, along, the, slide, allowing, the, same, sort, of, differential, measurements, as, with, the, dial, caliper, digital, calipers, may, contain, a, reading, hold, feature, allowing, the, reading, of, dimensions, after, use, in, awkward, locations, where, the, display, cannot, be, seen, like, analog, calipers, the, slide, of, many, digital, calipers, can, be, locked, using, a, lever, or, screw, ordinary, 150, mm, 6, in, digital, calipers, made, of, stainless, steel, have, a, rated, accuracy, of, 0, 02, mm, 0, 001, in, and, a, resolution, of, 0, 01, mm, 0, 0005, in, the, same, technology, is, used, for, longer, calipers, but, accuracy, declines, to, 0, 03, mm, 0, 001, in, for, 100, 200, mm, 4, 8, in, and, 0, 04, mm, 0, 0015, in, for, 200, 300, mm, 8, 12, in, measurements, many, digital, calipers, contain, a, capacitive, linear, encoder, inexpensive, chinese, models, have, 56, narrow, emitter, plates, and, one, long, receiver, plate, etched, on, the, sliding, display, s, printed, circuit, board, which, intersect, with, a, repeating, pattern, of, t, shaped, plates, in, the, longer, stator, board, the, top, of, the, t, plates, intersect, with, the, receiver, plate, while, the, vertical, bars, of, each, t, intersect, with, the, emitter, plates, the, pitch, of, each, t, in, the, stator, is, slightly, less, than, 8, times, the, pitch, of, each, emitter, plate, so, their, intersecting, capacitive, area, is, not, perfectly, aligned, but, rather, forms, an, interference, pattern, as, the, slider, moves, these, variable, capacitances, change, in, a, repeating, linear, fashion, the, slider, s, circuitry, counts, these, repetitions, as, it, slides, and, achieves, finer, resolution, using, linear, interpolation, of, the, capacitances, one, model, sends, 8, periodic, pulse, width, modulation, voltage, signals, which, appear, identical, but, out, of, phase, by, 1, 8, of, the, period, each, connected, to, 7, emitter, plates, and, the, resulting, analog, signal, is, read, through, a, single, receiver, plate, the, 1983, german, patent, de3340782c2, see, figure, is, said, to, describe, the, workings, other, digital, calipers, contain, an, inductive, linear, encoder, which, allows, robust, performance, in, the, presence, of, contamination, such, as, coolants, magnetic, linear, encoders, are, used, in, yet, other, digital, calipers, digital, calipers, nowadays, offer, serial, data, output, to, expedite, repeated, measurements, avoid, human, error, and, allow, direct, data, entry, into, a, digital, recorder, spreadsheet, statistical, process, control, program, or, similar, software, on, a, personal, computer, interfacing, devices, based, on, rs, 232, universal, serial, bus, or, wireless, can, be, built, or, purchased, the, serial, digital, output, varies, among, manufacturers, but, common, options, are, a, caliper, using, a, calibrated, screw, for, measurement, rather, than, a, slide, is, called, an, external, micrometer, caliper, gauge, a, micrometer, caliper, or, more, often, simply, a, micrometer, sometimes, the, term, caliper, referring, to, any, other, type, in, this, article, is, held, in, contradistinction, to, micrometer, each, of, the, above, types, of, calipers, has, its, relative, merits, and, faults, vernier, calipers, are, rugged, and, have, long, lasting, accuracy, are, coolant, proof, are, not, affected, by, magnetic, fields, and, are, largely, shockproof, they, may, have, both, centimeter, and, inch, scales, however, vernier, calipers, require, good, eyesight, or, a, magnifying, glass, to, read, and, can, be, difficult, to, read, from, a, distance, or, from, awkward, angles, it, is, relatively, easy, to, misread, the, last, digit, in, production, environments, reading, vernier, calipers, all, day, long, is, error, prone, and, is, annoying, to, the, workers, dial, calipers, are, comparatively, easy, to, read, especially, when, seeking, the, exact, center, by, rocking, and, observing, the, needle, movement, they, can, be, set, to, 0, at, any, point, for, comparisons, they, are, usually, fairly, susceptible, to, shock, damage, they, are, also, very, prone, to, getting, dirt, in, the, gears, which, can, cause, accuracy, problems, digital, calipers, switch, easily, between, centimeter, and, inch, systems, they, can, be, set, to, zero, easily, at, any, point, with, a, full, count, in, either, direction, and, can, take, measurements, even, if, the, display, is, completely, hidden, either, by, using, a, hold, key, or, by, zeroing, the, display, and, closing, the, jaws, showing, the, correct, measurement, but, negative, they, can, be, mechanically, and, electronically, fragile, most, also, require, batteries, and, do, not, resist, coolant, well, they, are, also, only, moderately, shockproof, and, can, be, vulnerable, to, dirt, calipers, may, read, to, a, resolution, of, 0, 01, mm, or, 0, 0005, in, but, accuracy, may, not, be, better, than, about, 0, 02, mm, or, 0, 001, in, for, 150, mm, 6, in, calipers, and, worse, for, longer, ones, a, caliper, must, be, properly, applied, against, the, part, in, order, to, take, the, desired, measurement, for, example, when, measuring, the, thickness, of, a, plate, a, vernier, caliper, must, be, held, at, right, angles, to, the, piece, some, practice, may, be, needed, to, measure, round, or, irregular, objects, correctly, accuracy, of, measurement, when, using, a, caliper, is, highly, dependent, on, the, skill, of, the, operator, regardless, of, type, a, caliper, s, jaws, must, be, forced, into, contact, with, the, part, being, measured, as, both, part, and, caliper, are, always, to, some, extent, elastic, the, amount, of, force, used, affects, the, indication, a, consistent, firm, touch, is, correct, too, much, force, results, in, an, under, indication, as, part, and, tool, distort, too, little, force, gives, insufficient, contact, and, an, over, indication, this, is, a, greater, problem, with, a, caliper, incorporating, a, wheel, which, lends, mechanical, advantage, this, is, especially, the, case, with, digital, calipers, calipers, out, of, adjustment, or, calipers, with, a, poor, quality, beam, simple, calipers, are, uncalibrated, the, measurement, taken, must, be, compared, against, a, scale, whether, the, scale, is, part, of, the, caliper, or, not, all, analog, calipers, verniers, and, dials, require, good, eyesight, in, order, to, achieve, the, highest, precision, digital, calipers, have, an, advantage, in, this, area, calibrated, calipers, may, be, mishandled, leading, to, loss, of, zero, when, a, caliper, s, jaws, are, fully, closed, it, should, of, course, indicate, zero, if, it, does, not, it, must, be, recalibrated, or, repaired, a, vernier, caliper, does, not, easily, lose, its, calibration, but, a, sharp, impact, or, accidental, damage, to, the, measuring, surface, in, the, caliper, jaw, can, be, significant, enough, to, displace, zero, digital, calipers, have, zero, set, buttons, for, quick, recalibration, vernier, dial, and, digital, calipers, can, be, used, with, accessories, that, extend, their, usefulness, examples, are, a, base, that, extends, their, usefulness, as, a, depth, gauge, and, a, jaw, attachment, that, all, allows, measuring, the, center, distance, between, holes, since, the, 1970s, a, clever, modification, of, the, moveable, jaw, on, the, back, side, of, any, caliper, allows, for, step, or, depth, measurements, in, addition, to, external, caliper, measurements, similarly, to, a, universal, micrometer, e, g, starrett, mul, t, anvil, or, mitutoyo, uni, mike, the, method, to, use, a, vernier, scale, or, caliper, with, zero, error, is, to, use, the, formula, actual, reading, main, scale, vernier, scale, zero, error, zero, error, may, arise, due, to, knocks, that, affect, the, calibration, at, 0, 00, mm, when, the, jaws, are, perfectly, closed, or, just, touching, each, other, positive, zero, error, refers, to, the, fact, that, when, the, jaws, of, the, vernier, caliper, are, just, closed, the, reading, is, a, positive, reading, away, from, the, actual, reading, of, 0, 00, mm, if, the, reading, is, 0, 10, mm, the, zero, error, is, referred, to, as, 0, 10, mm, negative, zero, error, refers, to, the, fact, that, when, the, jaws, of, the, vernier, caliper, are, just, closed, the, reading, is, a, negative, reading, away, from, the, actual, reading, of, 0, 00, mm, if, the, reading, is, 0, 08, mm, the, zero, error, is, referred, to, as, 0, 08, mm, calipers, with, measurement, axes, displaced, from, the, object, being, measured, suffer, from, abbe, error, if, the, jaws, are, not, perpendicular, due, to, manufacturing, tolerances, unlike, zero, error, the, amount, of, abbe, error, depends, on, the, offset
