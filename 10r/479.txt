an, ambulance, is, a, medically, equipped, vehicle, used, to, transport, patients, to, treatment, facilities, such, as, hospitals, typically, out, of, hospital, medical, care, is, provided, to, the, patient, during, the, transport, ambulances, are, used, to, respond, to, medical, emergencies, by, emergency, medical, services, ems, and, can, rapidly, transport, paramedics, and, other, first, responders, carry, equipment, for, administering, emergency, care, and, transport, patients, to, hospital, or, other, definitive, care, most, ambulances, use, a, design, based, on, vans, or, pickup, trucks, though, others, take, the, form, of, motorcycles, buses, hearses, aircraft, and, boats, ambulances, are, generally, considered, emergency, vehicles, authorized, to, be, equipped, with, emergency, lights, and, sirens, generally, vehicles, count, as, an, ambulance, if, they, can, transport, patients, however, it, varies, by, jurisdiction, as, to, whether, a, non, emergency, patient, transport, vehicle, also, called, an, ambulette, is, counted, as, an, ambulance, these, vehicles, are, not, usually, although, there, are, exceptions, equipped, with, life, support, equipment, and, are, usually, crewed, by, staff, with, fewer, qualifications, than, the, crew, of, emergency, ambulances, conversely, ems, agencies, may, also, have, nontransporting, ems, vehicles, that, cannot, transport, patients, the, term, ambulance, comes, from, the, latin, word, ambulare, as, meaning, to, walk, or, move, about, which, is, a, reference, to, early, medical, care, where, patients, were, moved, by, lifting, or, wheeling, the, word, originally, meant, a, moving, hospital, which, follows, an, army, in, its, movements, ambulances, ambulancias, in, spanish, were, first, used, for, emergency, transport, in, 1487, by, the, spanish, forces, during, the, siege, of, m, laga, by, the, catholic, monarchs, against, the, emirate, of, granada, during, the, american, civil, war, vehicles, for, conveying, the, wounded, off, the, field, of, battle, were, called, ambulance, wagons, field, hospitals, were, still, called, ambulances, during, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, and, in, the, serbo, turkish, war, of, 1876, even, though, the, wagons, were, first, referred, to, as, ambulances, about, 1854, during, the, crimean, war, the, history, of, the, ambulance, begins, in, ancient, times, with, the, use, of, carts, to, transport, incurable, patients, by, force, ambulances, were, first, used, for, emergency, transport, in, 1487, by, the, spanish, and, civilian, variants, were, put, into, operation, during, the, 1830s, advances, in, technology, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, led, to, modern, self, powered, ambulances, ambulances, can, be, grouped, into, types, depending, on, whether, or, not, they, transport, patients, and, under, what, conditions, in, some, cases, ambulances, may, fulfill, more, than, one, function, such, as, combining, emergency, ambulance, care, with, patient, transport, ambulances, can, be, based, on, many, types, of, vehicle, although, emergency, and, disaster, conditions, may, lead, to, other, vehicles, serving, as, makeshift, ambulances, ambulance, design, must, take, into, account, local, conditions, and, infrastructure, maintained, roads, are, necessary, for, road, going, ambulances, to, arrive, on, scene, and, then, transport, the, patient, to, a, hospital, though, in, rugged, areas, four, wheel, drive, or, all, terrain, vehicles, can, be, used, fuel, must, be, available, and, service, facilities, are, necessary, to, maintain, the, vehicle, methods, of, summoning, e, g, telephone, and, dispatching, ambulances, usually, rely, on, electronic, equipment, which, itself, often, relies, on, an, intact, power, grid, similarly, modern, ambulances, are, equipped, with, two, way, radios, or, cellular, telephones, to, enable, them, to, contact, hospitals, either, to, notify, the, appropriate, hospital, of, the, ambulance, s, pending, arrival, or, in, cases, where, physicians, do, not, form, part, of, the, ambulance, s, crew, to, confer, with, a, physician, for, medical, oversight, ambulances, often, have, two, stages, of, manufacturing, the, first, is, frequently, the, manufacture, of, light, or, medium, truck, chassis, cabs, or, full, size, vans, or, in, some, places, cars, such, as, mercedes, benz, nissan, toyota, or, ford, the, second, manufacturer, known, as, second, stage, manufacturer, modifies, the, vehicle, which, is, sometimes, purchased, incomplete, having, no, body, or, interior, behind, the, driver, s, seat, and, turns, it, into, an, ambulance, by, adding, bodywork, emergency, vehicle, equipment, and, interior, fittings, this, is, done, by, one, of, two, methods, either, coachbuilding, where, the, modifications, are, started, from, scratch, and, built, on, to, the, vehicle, or, using, a, modular, system, where, a, pre, built, box, is, put, on, to, the, empty, chassis, of, the, ambulance, and, then, finished, off, modern, ambulances, are, typically, powered, by, internal, combustion, engines, which, can, be, powered, by, any, conventional, fuel, including, diesel, gasoline, or, liquefied, petroleum, gas, depending, on, the, preference, of, the, operator, and, the, availability, of, different, options, colder, regions, often, use, gasoline, powered, engines, as, diesels, can, be, difficult, to, start, when, they, are, cold, warmer, regions, may, favor, diesel, engines, as, they, are, more, efficient, and, more, durable, diesel, power, is, sometimes, chosen, due, to, safety, concerns, after, a, series, of, fires, involving, gasoline, powered, ambulances, during, the, 1980s, these, fires, were, ultimately, attributed, in, part, to, gasoline, s, higher, volatility, in, comparison, to, diesel, fuel, the, type, of, engine, may, be, determined, by, the, manufacturer, in, the, past, two, decades, ford, would, only, sell, vehicles, for, ambulance, conversion, if, they, are, diesel, powered, beginning, in, 2010, ford, will, sell, its, ambulance, chassis, with, a, gasoline, engine, in, order, to, meet, emissions, requirements, in, the, united, kingdom, the, national, health, service, has, set, a, target, for, all, ambulances, to, be, fully, electric, as, part, of, the, net, zero, campaign, by, 2045, many, regions, have, prescribed, standards, which, ambulances, should, or, must, meet, in, order, to, be, used, for, their, role, these, standards, may, have, different, levels, which, reflect, the, type, of, patient, which, the, ambulance, is, expected, to, transport, for, instance, specifying, a, different, standard, for, routine, patient, transport, than, high, dependency, or, may, base, standards, on, the, size, of, vehicle, for, instance, in, europe, the, european, committee, for, standardization, publishes, the, standard, cen, 1789, which, specifies, minimum, compliance, levels, across, the, build, of, ambulance, including, crash, resistance, equipment, levels, and, exterior, marking, in, the, united, states, standards, for, ambulance, design, have, existed, since, 1976, where, the, standard, is, published, by, the, general, services, administration, and, known, as, kkk, a, 1822, this, standard, has, been, revised, several, times, and, is, currently, in, version, f, change, notice, 13, known, as, kkk, a, 1822f, the, national, fire, protection, association, has, also, published, a, design, standard, nfpa, 1917, which, offers, an, alternative, to, kkk, a, 1822f, the, commission, on, accreditation, of, ambulance, services, caas, has, published, its, ground, vehicle, standard, for, ambulances, v2, 0, effective, july, 2019, this, standard, is, similar, to, the, kkk, a, 1822f, and, nfpa, 1917, 2019, specifications, the, decision, on, which, of, the, current, 3, standards, to, require, is, left, up, to, each, individual, state, legislature, or, ems, director, some, states, have, no, specific, requirement, while, others, specify, which, standard, is, acceptable, others, yet, allow, the, end, user, to, decide, which, standard, to, comply, to, in, the, united, states, and, canada, there, are, four, types, of, ambulances, type, i, type, ii, type, iii, and, type, iv, type, i, is, based, on, a, heavy, truck, chassis, cab, with, a, custom, rear, compartment, that, is, often, referred, to, as, a, box, or, module, primarily, used, for, advanced, life, support, als, or, mobile, intensive, care, unit, micu, as, well, as, rescue, work, type, ii, is, based, on, a, commercial, heavy, duty, van, with, few, modifications, except, for, a, raised, roof, and, a, secondary, air, conditioning, unit, for, the, rear, of, the, vehicle, primarily, used, for, basic, life, support, bls, and, transfer, of, patients, though, they, are, occasionally, also, used, for, als, and, rescue, type, iii, is, a, van, chassis, cab, with, a, custom, made, rear, compartment, used, for, als, and, rescue, type, iv, is, for, ad, hoc, patient, transfer, using, smaller, utility, vehicles, selected, for, maneuverability, in, special, environments, such, as, dense, crowds, at, events, these, are, uncommon, and, are, not, subject, to, federal, regulations, in, the, united, states, the, move, towards, standardisation, is, now, reaching, countries, without, a, history, of, prescriptive, codes, such, as, india, which, approved, its, first, national, standard, for, ambulance, construction, in, 2013, ambulances, like, other, emergency, vehicles, are, required, to, operate, in, most, weather, conditions, including, those, during, which, civilian, drivers, often, elect, to, stay, off, the, road, also, the, ambulance, crew, s, responsibilities, to, their, patient, often, preclude, their, use, of, safety, devices, such, as, seat, belts, research, has, shown, that, ambulances, are, more, likely, to, be, involved, in, motor, vehicle, collisions, resulting, in, injury, or, death, than, either, fire, trucks, or, police, cars, unrestrained, occupants, particularly, those, riding, in, the, patient, care, compartment, are, particularly, vulnerable, when, compared, to, civilian, vehicles, of, similar, size, one, study, found, that, on, a, per, accident, basis, ambulance, collisions, tend, to, involve, more, people, and, result, in, more, injuries, an, 11, year, retrospective, study, concluded, in, 2001, found, that, although, most, fatal, ambulance, crashes, in, the, united, states, occurred, during, emergency, runs, they, typically, occurred, on, improved, straight, dry, roads, during, clear, weather, furthermore, paramedics, are, also, at, risk, in, ambulances, while, helping, patients, as, 27, paramedics, died, during, ambulance, trips, in, the, us, between, 1991, and, 2006, in, addition, to, the, equipment, directly, used, for, the, treatment, of, patients, ambulances, may, be, fitted, with, a, range, of, additional, equipment, which, is, used, in, order, to, facilitate, patient, care, this, could, include, in, parts, of, the, world, that, lack, a, high, level, of, infrastructure, ambulances, are, designed, to, meet, local, conditions, being, built, using, intermediate, technology, ambulances, can, also, be, trailers, which, are, pulled, by, bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or, animals, animal, powered, ambulances, can, be, particularly, useful, in, regions, that, are, subject, to, flooding, motorcycles, fitted, with, sidecars, or, motorcycle, ambulances, are, also, used, though, they, are, subject, to, some, of, the, same, limitations, as, more, traditional, over, the, road, ambulances, the, level, of, care, provided, by, these, ambulances, varies, between, merely, providing, transport, to, a, medical, clinic, to, providing, on, scene, and, continuing, care, during, transport, the, design, of, intermediate, technology, ambulances, must, take, into, account, not, only, the, operation, and, maintenance, of, the, ambulance, but, its, construction, as, well, the, robustness, of, the, design, becomes, more, important, as, does, the, nature, of, the, skills, required, to, properly, operate, the, vehicle, cost, effectiveness, can, be, a, high, priority, emergency, ambulances, are, highly, likely, to, be, involved, in, hazardous, situations, including, incidents, such, as, a, road, traffic, collision, as, these, emergencies, create, people, who, are, likely, to, be, in, need, of, treatment, they, are, required, to, gain, access, to, patients, as, quickly, as, possible, and, in, many, countries, are, given, dispensation, from, obeying, certain, traffic, laws, for, instance, they, may, be, able, to, treat, a, red, traffic, light, or, stop, sign, as, a, yield, sign, give, way, or, be, permitted, to, break, the, speed, limit, generally, the, priority, of, the, response, to, the, call, will, be, assigned, by, the, dispatcher, but, the, priority, of, the, return, will, be, decided, by, the, ambulance, crew, based, on, the, severity, of, the, patient, s, illness, or, injury, patients, in, significant, danger, to, life, and, limb, as, determined, by, triage, require, urgent, treatment, by, advanced, medical, personnel, and, because, of, this, need, emergency, ambulances, are, often, fitted, with, passive, and, active, visual, and, or, audible, warnings, to, alert, road, users, passive, visual, warnings, are, usually, part, of, the, design, of, the, vehicle, and, involve, the, use, of, high, contrast, patterns, older, ambulances, and, those, in, developing, countries, are, more, likely, to, have, their, pattern, painted, on, whereas, modern, ambulances, generally, carry, retro, reflective, designs, which, reflects, light, from, car, headlights, or, torches, popular, patterns, include, checker, board, alternate, coloured, squares, sometimes, called, battenburg, named, after, a, type, of, cake, chevrons, arrowheads, often, pointed, towards, the, front, of, the, vehicle, if, on, the, side, or, pointing, vertically, upwards, on, the, rear, or, stripes, along, the, side, these, were, the, first, type, of, retro, reflective, device, introduced, as, the, original, reflective, material, invented, by, 3m, only, came, in, tape, form, in, addition, to, retro, reflective, markings, some, services, now, have, the, vehicles, painted, in, a, bright, sometimes, fluorescent, yellow, or, orange, for, maximum, visual, impact, though, classic, white, or, red, are, also, common, fire, department, operated, ambulances, are, often, painted, red, to, match, the, fire, apparatuses, another, passive, marking, form, is, the, word, ambulance, or, local, language, variant, spelled, out, in, reverse, on, the, front, of, the, vehicle, this, enables, drivers, of, other, vehicles, to, more, easily, identify, an, approaching, ambulance, in, their, rear, view, mirrors, ambulances, may, display, the, name, of, their, owner, or, operator, and, an, emergency, telephone, number, for, the, ambulance, service, ambulances, may, also, carry, an, emblem, either, as, part, of, the, passive, warning, markings, or, not, such, as, a, red, cross, red, crescent, or, red, crystal, collective, known, as, the, protective, symbols, these, are, symbols, laid, down, by, the, geneva, convention, and, all, countries, signatory, to, it, agree, to, restrict, their, use, to, either, 1, military, ambulances, or, 2, the, national, red, cross, or, red, crescent, society, use, by, any, other, person, organization, or, agency, is, in, breach, of, international, law, the, protective, symbols, are, designed, to, indicate, to, all, people, especially, combatants, in, the, case, of, war, that, the, vehicle, is, neutral, and, is, not, to, be, fired, upon, hence, giving, protection, to, the, medics, and, their, casualties, although, this, has, not, always, been, adhered, to, in, israel, magen, david, adom, the, red, cross, member, organization, use, a, red, star, of, david, but, this, does, not, have, recognition, beyond, israeli, borders, where, they, must, use, the, red, crystal, the, star, of, life, is, widely, used, and, was, originally, designed, and, governed, by, the, u, s, national, highway, traffic, safety, administration, because, the, red, cross, symbol, is, legally, protected, by, both, national, and, international, law, ambulance, services, with, historical, origins, such, as, the, order, of, st, john, the, order, of, malta, ambulance, corps, and, malteser, international, often, use, the, maltese, cross, to, identify, their, ambulances, this, is, especially, important, in, countries, such, as, australia, where, st, john, ambulance, operate, one, state, and, one, territory, ambulance, service, and, all, of, australia, s, other, ambulance, services, use, variations, on, a, red, maltese, cross, fire, service, operated, ambulances, may, display, the, cross, of, st, florian, often, incorrectly, called, a, maltese, cross, as, this, cross, is, frequently, used, as, a, fire, department, logo, st, florian, being, the, patron, saint, of, firefighters, the, active, visual, warnings, are, usually, in, the, form, of, flashing, lights, these, flash, in, order, to, attract, the, attention, of, other, road, users, as, the, ambulance, approaches, or, to, provide, warning, to, motorists, approaching, a, stopped, ambulance, in, a, dangerous, position, on, the, road, common, colours, for, ambulance, warning, beacons, are, blue, red, amber, and, white, clear, however, the, colours, may, vary, by, country, and, sometimes, by, operator, there, are, several, technologies, in, use, to, achieve, the, flashing, effect, these, include, flashing, a, light, bulb, or, led, flashing, or, rotating, halogen, and, strobe, lights, which, are, usually, brighter, than, incandescent, lights, each, of, these, can, be, programmed, to, flash, singly, or, in, groups, and, can, be, programmed, to, flash, in, patterns, such, as, a, left, right, pattern, for, use, when, the, ambulance, is, parked, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, road, indicating, to, other, road, users, that, they, should, move, to, the, right, away, from, the, ambulance, incandescent, and, led, lights, may, also, be, programmed, to, burn, steadily, without, flashing, which, is, required, in, some, provinces, emergency, lights, may, simply, be, mounted, directly, on, the, body, or, may, be, housed, in, special, fittings, such, as, in, a, lightbar, or, in, special, flush, mount, designs, as, seen, on, the, danish, ambulance, to, the, right, or, may, be, hidden, in, a, host, light, such, as, a, headlamp, by, drilling, a, hole, in, the, host, light, s, reflector, and, inserting, the, emergency, light, these, hidden, lights, may, not, be, apparent, until, they, are, activated, additionally, some, of, the, standard, lights, fitted, to, an, ambulance, e, g, headlamps, tail, lamps, may, be, programmed, to, flash, flashing, headlights, typically, the, high, beams, flashed, alternately, are, known, as, a, wig, wag, additional, white, lights, may, be, placed, strategically, around, the, vehicle, to, illuminate, the, area, around, it, when, it, is, dark, almost, always, at, the, rear, for, loading, and, unloading, stretchers, and, often, at, the, sides, as, well, in, areas, very, far, north, or, south, where, there, are, times, of, year, with, long, periods, of, darkness, additional, driving, lights, at, the, front, are, often, fitted, as, well, to, increase, visibility, for, the, driver, in, order, to, increase, safety, it, is, best, practice, to, have, 360, coverage, with, the, active, warnings, improving, the, chance, of, the, vehicle, being, seen, from, all, sides, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, this, may, be, mandatory, the, roof, front, grille, sides, and, rear, of, the, body, and, front, fenders, are, common, places, to, mount, emergency, lights, a, certain, balance, must, be, made, when, deciding, on, the, number, and, location, of, lights, too, few, and, the, ambulance, may, not, be, noticed, easily, too, many, and, it, becomes, a, massive, distraction, for, other, road, users, more, than, it, is, already, increasing, the, risk, of, local, accidents, in, addition, to, visual, warnings, ambulances, can, be, fitted, with, audible, warnings, sometimes, known, as, sirens, which, can, alert, people, and, vehicles, to, the, presence, of, an, ambulance, before, they, can, be, seen, the, first, audible, warnings, were, mechanical, bells, mounted, to, either, the, front, or, roof, of, the, ambulance, most, modern, ambulances, are, now, fitted, with, electronic, sirens, producing, a, range, of, different, noises, which, ambulance, operators, can, use, to, attract, more, attention, to, themselves, particularly, when, proceeding, through, an, intersection, or, in, heavy, traffic, the, speakers, for, modern, sirens, can, be, integral, to, the, lightbar, or, they, may, be, hidden, in, or, flush, to, the, grill, to, reduce, noise, inside, the, ambulance, that, may, interfere, with, patient, care, and, radio, communications, ambulances, can, additionally, be, fitted, with, airhorn, audible, warnings, to, augment, the, effectiveness, of, the, siren, system, or, may, be, fitted, with, extremely, loud, two, tone, air, horns, as, their, primary, siren, a, recent, development, is, the, use, of, the, rds, system, of, car, radios, the, ambulance, is, fitted, with, a, short, range, fm, transmitter, set, to, rds, code, 31, which, interrupts, the, radio, of, all, cars, within, range, in, the, manner, of, a, traffic, broadcast, but, in, such, a, way, that, the, user, of, the, receiving, radio, is, unable, to, opt, out, of, the, message, as, with, traffic, broadcasts, this, feature, is, built, into, every, rds, radio, for, use, in, national, emergency, broadcast, systems, but, short, range, units, on, emergency, vehicles, can, prove, an, effective, means, of, alerting, traffic, to, their, presence, it, is, however, unlikely, that, this, system, could, replace, audible, warnings, as, it, is, unable, to, alert, pedestrians, those, not, using, a, compatible, radio, or, even, have, it, turned, off, in, the, united, states, the, cost, of, an, ambulance, ride, may, be, paid, for, from, several, sources, and, this, will, depend, on, the, local, situation, type, of, service, being, provided, by, whom, and, to, whom, there, are, differing, levels, of, qualification, that, the, ambulance, crew, may, hold, from, holding, no, formal, qualification, to, having, a, fully, qualified, doctor, on, board, most, ambulance, services, require, at, least, two, crew, members, to, be, on, every, ambulance, one, to, drive, and, one, to, attend, the, patient, it, may, be, the, case, that, only, the, attendant, need, be, qualified, and, the, driver, might, have, no, medical, training, in, some, locations, an, advanced, life, support, ambulance, may, be, crewed, by, one, paramedic, and, one, technician, or, in, countries, like, australia, advanced, life, support, registered, paramedics, common, ambulance, crew, qualifications, are, military, ambulances, have, historically, included, vehicles, based, on, civilian, designs, and, at, times, also, included, armored, but, unarmed, vehicle, ambulances, based, upon, armoured, personnel, carriers, apcs, in, the, second, world, war, vehicles, such, as, the, hanomag, sd, kfz, 251, half, track, were, pressed, into, service, as, ad, hoc, ambulances, and, in, more, recent, times, purpose, built, afvs, such, as, the, u, s, m1133, medical, evacuation, vehicle, serve, the, exclusive, purpose, of, armored, medical, vehicles, civilian, based, designs, may, be, painted, in, appropriate, colors, depending, on, the, operational, requirements, i, e, camouflage, for, field, use, white, for, united, nations, peacekeeping, etc, for, example, the, british, royal, army, medical, corps, has, a, fleet, of, white, ambulances, based, on, production, trucks, military, helicopters, have, also, served, both, as, ad, hoc, and, purpose, built, air, ambulances, since, they, are, extremely, useful, for, medevac, in, terms, of, equipment, military, ambulances, are, barebones, often, being, nothing, more, than, a, box, on, wheels, with, racks, to, place, manual, stretchers, though, for, the, operational, conditions, and, level, of, care, involved, this, is, usually, sufficient, since, laws, of, war, demand, ambulances, be, marked, with, one, of, the, emblems, of, the, red, cross, not, to, mount, offensive, weapons, military, ambulances, are, often, unarmed, it, is, a, generally, accepted, practice, in, most, countries, to, classify, the, personnel, attached, to, military, vehicles, marked, as, ambulances, as, non, combatants, however, this, does, not, always, exempt, medical, personnel, from, coming, under, fire, accidental, or, deliberate, as, a, result, medics, and, other, medical, personnel, attached, to, military, ambulances, are, usually, put, through, basic, military, training, on, the, assumption, that, they, may, have, to, use, a, weapon, the, laws, of, war, do, allow, non, combatant, military, personnel, to, carry, individual, weapons, for, protecting, themselves, and, casualties, however, not, all, militaries, exercise, this, right, to, their, personnel, the, israeli, defense, forces, modified, a, number, of, its, merkava, main, battle, tanks, with, ambulance, features, in, order, to, allow, rescue, operations, to, take, place, under, heavy, fire, in, urban, warfare, the, modifications, were, made, following, a, failed, rescue, attempt, in, which, palestinian, gunmen, killed, two, soldiers, who, were, providing, aid, for, a, palestinian, woman, in, rafah, since, m, 113, armored, personnel, carriers, and, regular, up, armored, ambulances, are, not, sufficiently, protected, against, anti, tank, weapons, and, improvised, explosive, devices, it, was, decided, to, use, the, heavily, armored, merkava, tank, its, rear, door, enables, the, evacuation, of, critically, wounded, soldiers, israel, did, not, remove, the, merkava, s, weaponry, claiming, that, weapons, were, more, effective, protection, than, emblems, since, palestinian, militants, would, disregard, any, symbols, of, protection, and, fire, at, ambulances, anyway, for, use, as, ground, ambulances, and, treatment, evacuation, vehicles, the, united, states, military, currently, employs, the, m113, the, m577, the, m1133, stryker, medical, evacuation, vehicle, mev, and, the, rg, 33, heavily, armored, ground, ambulance, haga, as, treatment, and, evacuation, vehicles, with, contracts, to, incorporate, the, newly, designed, m2a0, armored, medical, evacuation, vehicle, amev, a, variant, of, the, m2, bradley, fighting, vehicle, formerly, known, as, the, attv, some, navies, operate, ocean, going, hospital, ships, to, lend, medical, assistance, in, high, casualty, situations, such, as,
