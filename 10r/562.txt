a, sundial, is, a, horological, device, that, tells, the, time, of, day, referred, to, as, civil, time, in, modern, usage, when, direct, sunlight, shines, by, the, apparent, position, of, the, sun, in, the, sky, in, the, narrowest, sense, of, the, word, it, consists, of, a, flat, plate, the, dial, and, a, gnomon, which, casts, a, shadow, onto, the, dial, as, the, sun, appears, to, move, through, the, sky, the, shadow, aligns, with, different, hour, lines, which, are, marked, on, the, dial, to, indicate, the, time, of, day, the, style, is, the, time, telling, edge, of, the, gnomon, though, a, single, point, or, nodus, may, be, used, the, gnomon, casts, a, broad, shadow, the, shadow, of, the, style, shows, the, time, the, gnomon, may, be, a, rod, wire, or, elaborately, decorated, metal, casting, the, style, must, be, parallel, to, the, axis, of, the, earth, s, rotation, for, the, sundial, to, be, accurate, throughout, the, year, the, style, s, angle, from, horizontal, is, equal, to, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, the, term, sundial, can, refer, to, any, device, that, uses, the, sun, s, altitude, or, azimuth, or, both, to, show, the, time, sundials, are, valued, as, decorative, objects, metaphors, and, objects, of, intrigue, and, mathematical, study, the, passing, of, time, can, be, observed, by, placing, a, stick, in, the, sand, or, a, nail, in, a, board, and, placing, markers, at, the, edge, of, a, shadow, or, outlining, a, shadow, at, intervals, it, is, common, for, inexpensive, mass, produced, decorative, sundials, to, have, incorrectly, aligned, gnomons, shadow, lengths, and, hour, lines, which, cannot, be, adjusted, to, tell, correct, time, there, are, several, different, types, of, sundials, some, sundials, use, a, shadow, or, the, edge, of, a, shadow, while, others, use, a, line, or, spot, of, light, to, indicate, the, time, the, shadow, casting, object, known, as, a, gnomon, may, be, a, long, thin, rod, or, other, object, with, a, sharp, tip, or, a, straight, edge, sundials, employ, many, types, of, gnomon, the, gnomon, may, be, fixed, or, moved, according, to, the, season, it, may, be, oriented, vertically, horizontally, aligned, with, the, earth, s, axis, or, oriented, in, an, altogether, different, direction, determined, by, mathematics, given, that, sundials, use, light, to, indicate, time, a, line, of, light, may, be, formed, by, allowing, the, sun, s, rays, through, a, thin, slit, or, focusing, them, through, a, cylindrical, lens, a, spot, of, light, may, be, formed, by, allowing, the, sun, s, rays, to, pass, through, a, small, hole, window, oculus, or, by, reflecting, them, from, a, small, circular, mirror, a, spot, of, light, can, be, as, small, as, a, pinhole, in, a, solargraph, or, as, large, as, the, oculus, in, the, pantheon, sundials, also, may, use, many, types, of, surfaces, to, receive, the, light, or, shadow, planes, are, the, most, common, surface, but, partial, spheres, cylinders, cones, and, other, shapes, have, been, used, for, greater, accuracy, or, beauty, sundials, differ, in, their, portability, and, their, need, for, orientation, the, installation, of, many, dials, requires, knowing, the, local, latitude, the, precise, vertical, direction, e, g, by, a, level, or, plumb, bob, and, the, direction, to, true, north, portable, dials, are, self, aligning, for, example, it, may, have, two, dials, that, operate, on, different, principles, such, as, a, horizontal, and, analemmatic, dial, mounted, together, on, one, plate, in, these, designs, their, times, agree, only, when, the, plate, is, aligned, properly, sundials, may, indicate, the, local, solar, time, only, to, obtain, the, national, clock, time, three, corrections, are, required, the, principles, of, sundials, are, understood, most, easily, from, the, sun, s, apparent, motion, the, earth, rotates, on, its, axis, and, revolves, in, an, elliptical, orbit, around, the, sun, an, excellent, approximation, assumes, that, the, sun, revolves, around, a, stationary, earth, on, the, celestial, sphere, which, rotates, every, 24, hours, about, its, celestial, axis, the, celestial, axis, is, the, line, connecting, the, celestial, poles, since, the, celestial, axis, is, aligned, with, the, axis, about, which, the, earth, rotates, the, angle, of, the, axis, with, the, local, horizontal, is, the, local, geographical, latitude, unlike, the, fixed, stars, the, sun, changes, its, position, on, the, celestial, sphere, being, in, the, northern, hemisphere, at, a, positive, declination, in, spring, and, summer, and, at, a, negative, declination, in, autumn, and, winter, and, having, exactly, zero, declination, i, e, being, on, the, celestial, equator, at, the, equinoxes, the, sun, s, celestial, longitude, also, varies, changing, by, one, complete, revolution, per, year, the, path, of, the, sun, on, the, celestial, sphere, is, called, the, ecliptic, the, ecliptic, passes, through, the, twelve, constellations, of, the, zodiac, in, the, course, of, a, year, this, model, of, the, sun, s, motion, helps, to, understand, sundials, if, the, shadow, casting, gnomon, is, aligned, with, the, celestial, poles, its, shadow, will, revolve, at, a, constant, rate, and, this, rotation, will, not, change, with, the, seasons, this, is, the, most, common, design, in, such, cases, the, same, hour, lines, may, be, used, throughout, the, year, the, hour, lines, will, be, spaced, uniformly, if, the, surface, receiving, the, shadow, is, either, perpendicular, as, in, the, equatorial, sundial, or, circular, about, the, gnomon, as, in, the, armillary, sphere, in, other, cases, the, hour, lines, are, not, spaced, evenly, even, though, the, shadow, rotates, uniformly, if, the, gnomon, is, not, aligned, with, the, celestial, poles, even, its, shadow, will, not, rotate, uniformly, and, the, hour, lines, must, be, corrected, accordingly, the, rays, of, light, that, graze, the, tip, of, a, gnomon, or, which, pass, through, a, small, hole, or, reflect, from, a, small, mirror, trace, out, a, cone, aligned, with, the, celestial, poles, the, corresponding, light, spot, or, shadow, tip, if, it, falls, onto, a, flat, surface, will, trace, out, a, conic, section, such, as, a, hyperbola, ellipse, or, at, the, north, or, south, poles, a, circle, this, conic, section, is, the, intersection, of, the, cone, of, light, rays, with, the, flat, surface, this, cone, and, its, conic, section, change, with, the, seasons, as, the, sun, s, declination, changes, hence, sundials, that, follow, the, motion, of, such, light, spots, or, shadow, tips, often, have, different, hour, lines, for, different, times, of, the, year, this, is, seen, in, shepherd, s, dials, sundial, rings, and, vertical, gnomons, such, as, obelisks, alternatively, sundials, may, change, the, angle, or, position, or, both, of, the, gnomon, relative, to, the, hour, lines, as, in, the, analemmatic, dial, or, the, lambert, dial, the, earliest, sundials, known, from, the, archaeological, record, are, shadow, clocks, 1500, bc, or, bce, from, ancient, egyptian, astronomy, and, babylonian, astronomy, presumably, humans, were, telling, time, from, shadow, lengths, at, an, even, earlier, date, but, this, is, hard, to, verify, in, roughly, 700, bc, the, old, testament, describes, a, sundial, the, dial, of, ahaz, mentioned, in, isaiah, 38, 8, and, 2, kings, 20, 11, by, 240, bc, eratosthenes, had, estimated, the, circumference, of, the, world, using, an, obelisk, and, a, water, well, and, a, few, centuries, later, ptolemy, had, charted, the, latitude, of, cities, using, the, angle, of, the, sun, the, people, of, kush, created, sun, dials, through, geometry, the, roman, writer, vitruvius, lists, dials, and, shadow, clocks, known, at, that, time, in, his, de, architectura, the, tower, of, winds, constructed, in, athens, included, sundial, and, a, water, clock, for, telling, time, a, canonical, sundial, is, one, that, indicates, the, canonical, hours, of, liturgical, acts, such, sundials, were, used, from, the, 7th, to, the, 14th, centuries, by, the, members, of, religious, communities, the, italian, astronomer, giovanni, padovani, published, a, treatise, on, the, sundial, in, 1570, in, which, he, included, instructions, for, the, manufacture, and, laying, out, of, mural, vertical, and, horizontal, sundials, giuseppe, biancani, s, constructio, instrumenti, ad, horologia, solaria, c, 1620, discusses, how, to, make, a, perfect, sundial, they, have, been, commonly, used, since, the, 16th, century, in, general, sundials, indicate, the, time, by, casting, a, shadow, or, throwing, light, onto, a, surface, known, as, a, dial, face, or, dial, plate, although, usually, a, flat, plane, the, dial, face, may, also, be, the, inner, or, outer, surface, of, a, sphere, cylinder, cone, helix, and, various, other, shapes, the, time, is, indicated, where, a, shadow, or, light, falls, on, the, dial, face, which, is, usually, inscribed, with, hour, lines, although, usually, straight, these, hour, lines, may, also, be, curved, depending, on, the, design, of, the, sundial, see, below, in, some, designs, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, date, of, the, year, or, it, may, be, required, to, know, the, date, to, find, the, correct, time, in, such, cases, there, may, be, multiple, sets, of, hour, lines, for, different, months, or, there, may, be, mechanisms, for, setting, calculating, the, month, in, addition, to, the, hour, lines, the, dial, face, may, offer, other, data, such, as, the, horizon, the, equator, and, the, tropics, which, are, referred, to, collectively, as, the, dial, furniture, the, entire, object, that, casts, a, shadow, or, light, onto, the, dial, face, is, known, as, the, sundial, s, gnomon, however, it, is, usually, only, an, edge, of, the, gnomon, or, another, linear, feature, that, casts, the, shadow, used, to, determine, the, time, this, linear, feature, is, known, as, the, sundial, s, style, the, style, is, usually, aligned, parallel, to, the, axis, of, the, celestial, sphere, and, therefore, is, aligned, with, the, local, geographical, meridian, in, some, sundial, designs, only, a, point, like, feature, such, as, the, tip, of, the, style, is, used, to, determine, the, time, and, date, this, point, like, feature, is, known, as, the, sundial, s, nodus, some, sundials, use, both, a, style, and, a, nodus, to, determine, the, time, and, date, the, gnomon, is, usually, fixed, relative, to, the, dial, face, but, not, always, in, some, designs, such, as, the, analemmatic, sundial, the, style, is, moved, according, to, the, month, if, the, style, is, fixed, the, line, on, the, dial, plate, perpendicularly, beneath, the, style, is, called, the, substyle, meaning, below, the, style, the, angle, the, style, makes, with, the, plane, of, the, dial, plate, is, called, the, substyle, height, an, unusual, use, of, the, word, height, to, mean, an, angle, on, many, wall, dials, the, substyle, is, not, the, same, as, the, noon, line, see, below, the, angle, on, the, dial, plate, between, the, noon, line, and, the, substyle, is, called, the, substyle, distance, an, unusual, use, of, the, word, distance, to, mean, an, angle, by, tradition, many, sundials, have, a, motto, the, motto, is, usually, in, the, form, of, an, epigram, sometimes, sombre, reflections, on, the, passing, of, time, and, the, brevity, of, life, but, equally, often, humorous, witticisms, of, the, dial, maker, one, such, quip, is, i, am, a, sundial, and, i, make, a, botch, of, what, is, done, much, better, by, a, watch, a, dial, is, said, to, be, equiangular, if, its, hour, lines, are, straight, and, spaced, equally, most, equiangular, sundials, have, a, fixed, gnomon, style, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, as, well, as, a, shadow, receiving, surface, that, is, symmetrical, about, that, axis, examples, include, the, equatorial, dial, the, equatorial, bow, the, armillary, sphere, the, cylindrical, dial, and, the, conical, dial, however, other, designs, are, equiangular, such, as, the, lambert, dial, a, version, of, the, analemmatic, sundial, with, a, moveable, style, a, sundial, at, a, particular, latitude, in, one, hemisphere, must, be, reversed, for, use, at, the, opposite, latitude, in, the, other, hemisphere, a, vertical, direct, south, sundial, in, the, northern, hemisphere, becomes, a, vertical, direct, north, sundial, in, the, southern, hemisphere, to, position, a, horizontal, sundial, correctly, one, has, to, find, true, north, or, south, the, same, process, can, be, used, to, do, both, the, gnomon, set, to, the, correct, latitude, has, to, point, to, the, true, south, in, the, southern, hemisphere, as, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, has, to, point, to, the, true, north, the, hour, numbers, also, run, in, opposite, directions, so, on, a, horizontal, dial, they, run, anticlockwise, us, counterclockwise, rather, than, clockwise, sundials, which, are, designed, to, be, used, with, their, plates, horizontal, in, one, hemisphere, can, be, used, with, their, plates, vertical, at, the, complementary, latitude, in, the, other, hemisphere, for, example, the, illustrated, sundial, in, perth, australia, which, is, at, latitude, 32, south, would, function, properly, if, it, were, mounted, on, a, south, facing, vertical, wall, at, latitude, 58, i, e, 90, 32, north, which, is, slightly, further, north, than, perth, scotland, the, surface, of, the, wall, in, scotland, would, be, parallel, with, the, horizontal, ground, in, australia, ignoring, the, difference, of, longitude, so, the, sundial, would, work, identically, on, both, surfaces, correspondingly, the, hour, marks, which, run, counterclockwise, on, a, horizontal, sundial, in, the, southern, hemisphere, also, do, so, on, a, vertical, sundial, in, the, northern, hemisphere, see, the, first, two, illustrations, at, the, top, of, this, article, on, horizontal, northern, hemisphere, sundials, and, on, vertical, southern, hemisphere, ones, the, hour, marks, run, clockwise, the, most, common, reason, for, a, sundial, to, differ, greatly, from, clock, time, is, that, the, sundial, has, not, been, oriented, correctly, or, its, hour, lines, have, not, been, drawn, correctly, for, example, most, commercial, sundials, are, designed, as, horizontal, sundials, as, described, above, to, be, accurate, such, a, sundial, must, have, been, designed, for, the, local, geographical, latitude, and, its, style, must, be, parallel, to, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, the, style, must, be, aligned, with, true, north, and, its, height, its, angle, with, the, horizontal, must, equal, the, local, latitude, to, adjust, the, style, height, the, sundial, can, often, be, tilted, slightly, up, or, down, while, maintaining, the, style, s, north, south, alignment, some, areas, of, the, world, practice, daylight, saving, time, which, changes, the, official, time, usually, by, one, hour, this, shift, must, be, added, to, the, sundial, s, time, to, make, it, agree, with, the, official, time, a, standard, time, zone, covers, roughly, 15, of, longitude, so, any, point, within, that, zone, which, is, not, on, the, reference, longitude, generally, a, multiple, of, 15, will, experience, a, difference, from, standard, time, that, is, equal, to, 4, minutes, of, time, per, degree, for, illustration, sunsets, and, sunrises, are, at, a, much, later, official, time, at, the, western, edge, of, a, time, zone, compared, to, sunrise, and, sunset, times, at, the, eastern, edge, if, a, sundial, is, located, at, say, a, longitude, 5, west, of, the, reference, longitude, then, its, time, will, read, 20, minutes, slow, since, the, sun, appears, to, revolve, around, the, earth, at, 15, per, hour, this, is, a, constant, correction, throughout, the, year, for, equiangular, dials, such, as, equatorial, spherical, or, lambert, dials, this, correction, can, be, made, by, rotating, the, dial, surface, by, an, angle, equaling, the, difference, in, longitude, without, changing, the, gnomon, position, or, orientation, however, this, method, does, not, work, for, other, dials, such, as, a, horizontal, dial, the, correction, must, be, applied, by, the, viewer, however, for, political, and, practical, reasons, time, zone, boundaries, have, been, skewed, at, their, most, extreme, time, zones, can, cause, official, noon, including, daylight, savings, to, occur, up, to, three, hours, early, in, which, case, the, sun, is, actually, on, the, meridian, at, official, clock, time, of, 3, pm, this, occurs, in, the, far, west, of, alaska, china, and, spain, for, more, details, and, examples, see, time, zones, although, the, sun, appears, to, rotate, uniformly, about, the, earth, in, reality, this, motion, is, not, perfectly, uniform, this, is, due, to, the, eccentricity, of, the, earth, s, orbit, the, fact, that, the, earth, s, orbit, about, the, sun, is, not, perfectly, circular, but, slightly, elliptical, and, the, tilt, obliquity, of, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, relative, to, the, plane, of, its, orbit, therefore, sundial, time, varies, from, standard, clock, time, on, four, days, of, the, year, the, correction, is, effectively, zero, however, on, others, it, can, be, as, much, as, a, quarter, hour, early, or, late, the, amount, of, correction, is, described, by, the, equation, of, time, this, correction, is, equal, worldwide, it, does, not, depend, on, the, local, latitude, or, longitude, of, the, observer, s, position, it, does, however, change, over, long, periods, of, time, centuries, or, more, because, of, slow, variations, in, the, earth, s, orbital, and, rotational, motions, therefore, tables, and, graphs, of, the, equation, of, time, that, were, made, centuries, ago, are, now, significantly, incorrect, the, reading, of, an, old, sundial, should, be, corrected, by, applying, the, present, day, equation, of, time, not, one, from, the, period, when, the, dial, was, made, in, some, sundials, the, equation, of, time, correction, is, provided, as, an, informational, plaque, affixed, to, the, sundial, for, the, observer, to, calculate, in, more, sophisticated, sundials, the, equation, can, be, incorporated, automatically, for, example, some, equatorial, bow, sundials, are, supplied, with, a, small, wheel, that, sets, the, time, of, year, this, wheel, in, turn, rotates, the, equatorial, bow, offsetting, its, time, measurement, in, other, cases, the, hour, lines, may, be, curved, or, the, equatorial, bow, may, be, shaped, like, a, vase, which, exploits, the, changing, altitude, of, the, sun, over, the, year, to, effect, the, proper, offset, in, time, a, heliochronometer, is, a, precision, sundial, first, devised, in, about, 1763, by, philipp, hahn, and, improved, by, abb, guyoux, in, about, 1827, it, corrects, apparent, solar, time, to, mean, solar, time, or, another, standard, time, heliochronometers, usually, indicate, the, minutes, to, within, 1, minute, of, universal, time, the, sunquest, sundial, designed, by, richard, l, schmoyer, in, the, 1950s, uses, an, analemmic, inspired, gnomon, to, cast, a, shaft, of, light, onto, an, equatorial, time, scale, crescent, sunquest, is, adjustable, for, latitude, and, longitude, automatically, correcting, for, the, equation, of, time, rendering, it, as, accurate, as, most, pocket, watches, similarly, in, place, of, the, shadow, of, a, gnomon, the, sundial, at, miguel, hern, ndez, university, uses, the, solar, projection, of, a, graph, of, the, equation, of, time, intersecting, a, time, scale, to, display, clock, time, directly, an, analemma, may, be, added, to, many, types, of, sundials, to, correct, apparent, solar, time, to, mean, solar, time, or, another, standard, time, these, usually, have, hour, lines, shaped, like, figure, eights, analemmas, according, to, the, equation, of, time, this, compensates, for, the, slight, eccentricity, in, the, earth, s, orbit, and, the, tilt, of, the, earth, s, axis, that, causes, up, to, a, 15, minute, variation, from, mean, solar, time, this, is, a, type, of, dial, furniture, seen, on, more, complicated, horizontal, and, vertical, dials, prior, to, the, invention, of, accurate, clocks, in, the, mid, 17th, century, sundials, were, the, only, timepieces, in, common, use, and, were, considered, to, tell, the, right, time, the, equation, of, time, was, not, used, after, the, invention, of, good, clocks, sundials, were, still, considered, to, be, correct, and, clocks, usually, incorrect, the, equation, of, time, was, used, in, the, opposite, direction, from, today, to, apply, a, correction, to, the, time, shown, by, a, clock, to, make, it, agree, with, sundial, time, some, elaborate, equation, clocks, such, as, one, made, by, joseph, williamson, in, 1720, incorporated, mechanisms, to, do, this, correction, automatically, williamson, s, clock, may, have, been, the, first, ever, device, to, use, a, differential, gear, only, after, about, 1800, was, uncorrected, clock, time, considered, to, be, right, and, sundial, time, usually, wrong, so, the, equation, of, time, became, used, as, it, is, today, the, most, commonly, observed, sundials, are, those, in, which, the, shadow, casting, style, is, fixed, in, position, and, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, being, oriented, with, true, north, and, south, and, making, an, angle, with, the, horizontal, equal, to, the, geographical, latitude, this, axis, is, aligned, with, the, celestial, poles, which, is, closely, but, not, perfectly, aligned, with, the, pole, star, polaris, for, illustration, the, celestial, axis, points, vertically, at, the, true, north, pole, whereas, it, points, horizontally, on, the, equator, the, world, s, largest, axial, gnomon, sundial, is, the, mast, of, the, sundial, bridge, at, turtle, bay, in, redding, california, a, formerly, world, s, largest, gnomon, is, at, jaipur, raised, 26, 55, above, horizontal, reflecting, the, local, latitude, on, any, given, day, the, sun, appears, to, rotate, uniformly, about, this, axis, at, about, 15, per, hour, making, a, full, circuit, 360, in, 24, hours, a, linear, gnomon, aligned, with, this, axis, will, cast, a, sheet, of, shadow, a, half, plane, that, falling, opposite, to, the, sun, likewise, rotates, about, the, celestial, axis, at, 15, per, hour, the, shadow, is, seen, by, falling, on, a, receiving, surface, that, is, usually, flat, but, which, may, be, spherical, cylindrical, conical, or, of, other, shapes, if, the, shadow, falls, on, a, surface, that, is, symmetrical, about, the, celestial, axis, as, in, an, armillary, sphere, or, an, equatorial, dial, the, surface, shadow, likewise, moves, uniformly, the, hour, lines, on, the, sundial, are, equally, spaced, however, if, the, receiving, surface, is, not, symmetrical, as, in, most, horizontal, sundials, the, surface, shadow, generally, moves, non, uniformly, and, the, hour, lines, are, not, equally, spaced, one, exception, is, the, lambert, dial, described, below, some, types, of, sundials, are, designed, with, a, fixed, gnomon, that, is, not, aligned, with, the, celestial, poles, like, a, vertical, obelisk, such, sundials, are, covered, below, under, the, section, nodus, based, sundials, the, formulas, shown, in, the, paragraphs, below, allow, the, positions, of, the, hour, lines, to, be, calculated, for, various, types, of, sundial, in, some, cases, the, calculations, are, simple, in, others, they, are, extremely, complicated, there, is, an, alternative, simple, method, of, finding, the, positions, of, the, hour, lines, which, can, be, used, for, many, types, of, sundial, and, saves, a, lot, of, work, in, cases, where, the, calculations, are, complex, this, is, an, empirical, procedure, in, which, the, position, of, the, shadow, of, the, gnomon, of, a, real, sundial, is, marked, at, hourly, intervals, the, equation, of, time, must, be, taken, into, account, to, ensure, that, the, positions, of, the, hour, lines, are, independent, of, the, time, of, year, when, they, are, marked, an, easy, way, to, do, this, is, to, set, a, clock, or, watch, so, it, shows, sundial, time, which, is, standard, time, plus, the, equation, of, time, on, the, day, in, question, the, hour, lines, on, the, sundial, are, marked, to, show, the, positions, of, the, shadow, of, the, style, when, this, clock, shows, whole, numbers, of, hours, and, are, labelled, with, these, numbers, of, hours, for, example, when, the, clock, reads, 5, 00, the, shadow, of, the, style, is, marked, and, labelled, 5, or, v, in, roman, numerals, if, the, hour, lines, are, not, all, marked, in, a, single, day, the, clock, must, be, adjusted, every, day, or, two, to, take, account, of, the, variation, of, the, equation, of, time, the, distinguishing, characteristic, of, the, equatorial, dial, also, called, the, equinoctial, dial, is, the, planar, surface, that, receives, the, shadow, which, is, exactly, perpendicular, to, the, gnomon, s, style, this, plane, is, called, equatorial, because, it, is, parallel, to, the, equator, of, the, earth, and, of, the, celestial, sphere, if, the, gnomon, is, fixed, and, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, the, sun, s, apparent, rotation, about, the, earth, casts, a, uniformly, rotating, sheet, of, shadow, from, the, gnomon, this, produces, a, uniformly, rotating, line, of, shadow, on, the, equatorial, plane, since, the, earth, rotates, 360, in, 24, hours, the, hour, lines, on, an, equatorial, dial, are, all, spaced, 15, apart, 360, 24, the, uniformity, of, their, spacing, makes, this, type, of, sundial, easy, to, construct, if, the, dial, plate, material, is, opaque, both, sides, of, the, equatorial, dial, must, be, marked, since, the, shadow, will, be, cast, from, below, in, winter, and, from, above, in, summer, with, translucent, dial, plates, e, g, glass, the, hour, angles, need, only, be, marked, on, the, sun, facing, side, although, the, hour, numberings, if, used, need, be, made, on, both, sides, of, the, dial, owing, to, the, differing, hour, schema, on, the, sun, facing, and, sun, backing, sides, another, major, advantage, of, this, dial, is, that, equation, of, time, eot, and, daylight, saving, time, dst, corrections, can, be, made, by, simply, rotating, the, dial, plate, by, the, appropriate, angle, each, day, this, is, because, the, hour, angles, are, equally, spaced, around, the, dial, for, this, reason, an, equatorial, dial, is, often, a, useful, choice, when, the, dial, is, for, public, display, and, it, is, desirable, to, have, it, show, the, true, local, time, to, reasonable, accuracy, the, eot, correction, is, made, via, the, relation, near, the, equinoxes, in, spring, and, autumn, the, sun, moves, on, a, circle, that, is, nearly, the, same, as, the, equatorial, plane, hence, no, clear, shadow, is, produced, on, the, equatorial, dial, at, those, times, of, year, a, drawback, of, the, design, a, nodus, is, sometimes, added, to, equatorial, sundials, which, allows, the, sundial, to, tell, the, time, of, year, on, any, given, day, the, shadow, of, the, nodus, moves, on, a, circle, on, the, equatorial, plane, and, the, radius, of, the, circle, measures, the, declination, of, the, sun, the, ends, of, the, gnomon, bar, may, be, used, as, the, nodus, or, some, feature, along, its, length, an, ancient, variant, of, the, equatorial, sundial, has, only, a, nodus, no, style, and, the, concentric, circular, hour, lines, are, arranged, to, resemble, a, spider, web, in, the, horizontal, sundial, also, called, a, garden, sundial, the, plane, that, receives, the, shadow, is, aligned, horizontally, rather, than, being, perpendicular, to, the, style, as, in, the, equatorial, dial, hence, the, line, of, shadow, does, not, rotate, uniformly, on, the, dial, face, rather, the, hour, lines, are, spaced, according, to, the, rule, or, in, other, terms, where, l, is, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, and, the, angle, the, gnomon, makes, with, the, dial, plate, h, h, displaystyle, h, h, is, the, angle, between, a, given, hour, line, and, the, noon, hour, line, which, always, points, towards, true, north, on, the, plane, and, t, is, the, number, of, hours, before, or, after, noon, for, example, the, angle, h, h, displaystyle, h, h, of, the, 3, pm, hour, line, would, equal, the, arctangent, of, sin, l, since, tan, 45, 1, when, l, 90, displaystyle, l, 90, circ, at, the, north, pole, the, horizontal, sundial, becomes, an, equatorial, sundial, the, style, points, straight, up, vertically, and, the, horizontal, plane, is, aligned, with, the, equatorial, plane, the, hour, line, formula, becomes, h, h, 15, t, displaystyle, h, h, 15, circ, times, t, as, for, an, equatorial, dial, a, horizontal, sundial, at, the, earth, s, equator, where, l, 0, displaystyle, l, 0, circ, would, require, a, raised, horizontal, style, and, would, be, an, example, of, a, polar, sundial, see, below, the, chief, advantages, of, the, horizontal, sundial, are, that, it, is, easy, to, read, and, the, sunlight, lights, the, face, throughout, the, year, all, the, hour, lines, intersect, at, the, point, where, the, gnomon, s, style, crosses, the, horizontal, plane, since, the, style, is, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, the, style, points, true, north, and, its, angle, with, the, horizontal, equals, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, l, a, sundial, designed, for, one, latitude, can, be, adjusted, for, use, at, another, latitude, by, tilting, its, base, upwards, or, downwards, by, an, angle, equal, to, the, difference, in, latitude, for, example, a, sundial, designed, for, a, latitude, of, 40, can, be, used, at, a, latitude, of, 45, if, the, sundial, plane, is, tilted, upwards, by, 5, thus, aligning, the, style, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, many, ornamental, sundials, are, designed, to, be, used, at, 45, degrees, north, some, mass, produced, garden, sundials, fail, to, correctly, calculate, the, hourlines, and, so, can, never, be, corrected, a, local, standard, time, zone, is, nominally, 15, degrees, wide, but, may, be, modified, to, follow, geographic, or, political, boundaries, a, sundial, can, be, rotated, around, its, style, which, must, remain, pointed, at, the, celestial, pole, to, adjust, to, the, local, time, zone, in, most, cases, a, rotation, in, the, range, of, 7, 5, east, to, 23, west, suffices, this, will, introduce, error, in, sundials, that, do, not, have, equal, hour, angles, to, correct, for, daylight, saving, time, a, face, needs, two, sets, of, numerals, or, a, correction, table, an, informal, standard, is, to, have, numerals, in, hot, colors, for, summer, and, in, cool, colors, for, winter, since, the, hour, angles, are, not, evenly, spaced, the, equation, of, time, corrections, cannot, be, made, via, rotating, the, dial, plate, about, the, gnomon, axis, these, types, of, dials, usually, have, an, equation, of, time, correction, tabulation, engraved, on, their, pedestals, or, close, by, horizontal, dials, are, commonly, seen, in, gardens, churchyards, and, in, public, areas, in, the, common, vertical, dial, the, shadow, receiving, plane, is, aligned, vertically, as, usual, the, gnomon, s, style, is, aligned, with, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, as, in, the, horizontal, dial, the, line, of, shadow, does, not, move, uniformly, on, the, face, the, sundial, is, not, equiangular, if, the, face, of, the, vertical, dial, points, directly, south, the, angle, of, the, hour, lines, is, instead, described, by, the, formula, where, l, is, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, h, v, displaystyle, h, v, is, the, angle, between, a, given, hour, line, and, the, noon, hour, line, which, always, points, due, north, on, the, plane, and, t, is, the, number, of, hours, before, or, after, noon, for, example, the, angle, h, v, displaystyle, h, v, of, the, 3, p, m, hour, line, would, equal, the, arctangent, of, cos, l, since, tan, 45, 1, the, shadow, moves, counter, clockwise, on, a, south, facing, vertical, dial, whereas, it, runs, clockwise, on, horizontal, and, equatorial, north, facing, dials, dials, with, faces, perpendicular, to, the, ground, and, which, face, directly, south, north, east, or, west, are, called, vertical, direct, dials, it, is, widely, believed, and, stated, in, respectable, publications, that, a, vertical, dial, cannot, receive, more, than, twelve, hours, of, sunlight, a, day, no, matter, how, many, hours, of, daylight, there, are, however, there, is, an, exception, vertical, sundials, in, the, tropics, which, face, the, nearer, pole, e, g, north, facing, in, the, zone, between, the, equator, and, the, tropic, of, cancer, can, actually, receive, sunlight, for, more, than, 12, hours, from, sunrise, to, sunset, for, a, short, period, around, the, time, of, the, summer, solstice, for, example, at, latitude, 20, north, on, june, 21, the, sun, shines, on, a, north, facing, vertical, wall, for, 13, hours, 21, minutes, vertical, sundials, which, do, not, face, directly, south, in, the, northern, hemisphere, may, receive, significantly, less, than, twelve, hours, of, sunlight, per, day, depending, on, the, direction, they, do, face, and, on, the, time, of, year, for, example, a, vertical, dial, that, faces, due, east, can, tell, time, only, in, the, morning, hours, in, the, afternoon, the, sun, does, not, shine, on, its, face, vertical, dials, that, face, due, east, or, west, are, polar, dials, which, will, be, described, below, vertical, dials, that, face, north, are, uncommon, because, they, tell, time, only, during, the, spring, and, summer, and, do, not, show, the, midday, hours, except, in, tropical, latitudes, and, even, there, only, around, midsummer, for, non, direct, vertical, dials, those, that, face, in, non, cardinal, directions, the, mathematics, of, arranging, the, style, and, the, hour, lines, becomes, more, complicated, it, may, be, easier, to, mark, the, hour, lines, by, observation, but, the, placement, of, the, style, at, least, must, be, calculated, first, such, dials, are, said, to, be, declining, dials, vertical, dials, are, commonly, mounted, on, the, walls, of, buildings, such, as, town, halls, cupolas, and, church, towers, where, they, are, easy, to, see, from, far, away, in, some, cases, vertical, dials, are, placed, on, all, four, sides, of, a, rectangular, tower, providing, the, time, throughout, the, day, the, face, may, be, painted, on, the, wall, or, displayed, in, inlaid, stone, the, gnomon, is, often, a, single, metal, bar, or, a, tripod, of, metal, bars, for, rigidity, if, the, wall, of, the, building, faces, toward, the, south, but, does, not, face, due, south, the, gnomon, will, not, lie, along, the, noon, line, and, the, hour, lines, must, be, corrected, since, the, gnomon, s, style, must, be, parallel, to, the, earth, s, axis, it, always, points, true, north, and, its, angle, with, the, horizontal, will, equal, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, on, a, direct, south, dial, its, angle, with, the, vertical, face, of, the, dial, will, equal, the, colatitude, or, 90, minus, the, latitude, in, polar, dials, the, shadow, receiving, plane, is, aligned, parallel, to, the, gnomon, style, thus, the, shadow, slides, sideways, over, the, surface, moving, perpendicularly, to, itself, as, the, sun, rotates, about, the, style, as, with, the, gnomon, the, hour, lines, are, all, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, when, the, sun, s, rays, are, nearly, parallel, to, the, plane, the, shadow, moves, very, quickly, and, the, hour, lines, are, spaced, far, apart, the, direct, east, and, west, facing, dials, are, examples, of, a, polar, dial, however, the, face, of, a, polar, dial, need, not, be, vertical, it, need, only, be, parallel, to, the, gnomon, thus, a, plane, inclined, at, the, angle, of, latitude, relative, to, horizontal, under, the, similarly, inclined, gnomon, will, be, a, polar, dial, the, perpendicular, spacing, x, of, the, hour, lines, in, the, plane, is, described, by, the, formula, where, h, is, the, height, of, the, style, above, the, plane, and, t, is, the, time, in, hours, before, or, after, the, center, time, for, the, polar, dial, the, center, time, is, the, time, when, the, style, s, shadow, falls, directly, down, on, the, plane, for, an, east, facing, dial, the, center, time, will, be, 6, a, m, for, a, west, facing, dial, this, will, be, 6, p, m, and, for, the, inclined, dial, described, above, it, will, be, noon, when, t, approaches, 6, hours, away, from, the, center, time, the, spacing, x, diverges, to, this, occurs, when, the, sun, s, rays, become, parallel, to, the, plane, a, declining, dial, is, any, non, horizontal, planar, dial, that, does, not, face, in, a, cardinal, direction, such, as, true, north, south, east, or, west, as, usual, the, gnomon, s, style, is, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, but, the, hour, lines, are, not, symmetrical, about, the, noon, hour, line, for, a, vertical, dial, the, angle, h, vd, displaystyle, h, text, vd, between, the, noon, hour, line, and, another, hour, line, is, given, by, the, formula, below, note, that, h, vd, displaystyle, h, text, vd, is, defined, positive, in, the, clockwise, sense, w, r, t, the, upper, vertical, hour, angle, and, that, its, conversion, to, the, equivalent, solar, hour, requires, careful, consideration, of, which, quadrant, of, the, sundial, that, it, belongs, in, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, t, is, the, time, before, or, after, noon, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, angle, of, declination, from, true, south, defined, as, positive, when, east, of, south, and, s, o, displaystyle, s, o, is, a, switch, integer, for, the, dial, orientation, a, partly, south, facing, dial, has, an, s, o, displaystyle, s, o, value, of, 1, those, partly, north, facing, a, value, of, 1, when, such, a, dial, faces, south, d, 0, displaystyle, d, 0, circ, this, formula, reduces, to, the, formula, given, above, for, vertical, south, facing, dials, i, e, when, a, sundial, is, not, aligned, with, a, cardinal, direction, the, substyle, of, its, gnomon, is, not, aligned, with, the, noon, hour, line, the, angle, b, displaystyle, b, between, the, substyle, and, the, noon, hour, line, is, given, by, the, formula, if, a, vertical, sundial, faces, true, south, or, north, d, 0, displaystyle, d, 0, circ, or, d, 180, displaystyle, d, 180, circ, respectively, the, angle, b, 0, displaystyle, b, 0, circ, and, the, substyle, is, aligned, with, the, noon, hour, line, the, height, of, the, gnomon, that, is, the, angle, the, style, makes, to, the, plate, g, displaystyle, g, is, given, by, the, sundials, described, above, have, gnomons, that, are, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, and, cast, their, shadow, onto, a, plane, if, the, plane, is, neither, vertical, nor, horizontal, nor, equatorial, the, sundial, is, said, to, be, reclining, or, inclining, such, a, sundial, might, be, located, on, a, south, facing, roof, for, example, the, hour, lines, for, such, a, sundial, can, be, calculated, by, slightly, correcting, the, horizontal, formula, above, where, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, desired, angle, of, reclining, relative, to, the, local, vertical, l, is, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, h, r, v, displaystyle, h, rv, is, the, angle, between, a, given, hour, line, and, the, noon, hour, line, which, always, points, due, north, on, the, plane, and, t, is, the, number, of, hours, before, or, after, noon, for, example, the, angle, h, r, v, displaystyle, h, rv, of, the, 3pm, hour, line, would, equal, the, arctangent, of, cos, l, r, since, tan, 45, 1, when, r, 0, in, other, words, a, south, facing, vertical, dial, we, obtain, the, vertical, dial, formula, above, some, authors, use, a, more, specific, nomenclature, to, describe, the, orientation, of, the, shadow, receiving, plane, if, the, plane, s, face, points, downwards, towards, the, ground, it, is, said, to, be, proclining, or, inclining, whereas, a, dial, is, said, to, be, reclining, when, the, dial, face, is, pointing, away, from, the, ground, many, authors, also, often, refer, to, reclined, proclined, and, inclined, sundials, in, general, as, inclined, sundials, it, is, also, common, in, the, latter, case, to, measure, the, angle, of, inclination, relative, to, the, horizontal, plane, on, the, sun, side, of, the, dial, in, such, texts, since, i, 90, r, displaystyle, i, 90, circ, r, the, hour, angle, formula, will, often, be, seen, written, as, the, angle, between, the, gnomon, style, and, the, dial, plate, b, in, this, type, of, sundial, is, or, some, sundials, both, decline, and, recline, in, that, their, shadow, receiving, plane, is, not, oriented, with, a, cardinal, direction, such, as, true, north, or, true, south, and, is, neither, horizontal, nor, vertical, nor, equatorial, for, example, such, a, sundial, might, be, found, on, a, roof, that, was, not, oriented, in, a, cardinal, direction, the, formulae, describing, the, spacing, of, the, hour, lines, on, such, dials, are, rather, more, complicated, than, those, for, simpler, dials, there, are, various, solution, approaches, including, some, using, the, methods, of, rotation, matrices, and, some, making, a, 3d, model, of, the, reclined, declined, plane, and, its, vertical, declined, counterpart, plane, extracting, the, geometrical, relationships, between, the, hour, angle, components, on, both, these, planes, and, then, reducing, the, trigonometric, algebra, one, system, of, formulas, for, reclining, declining, sundials, as, stated, by, fennewick, the, angle, h, rd, displaystyle, h, text, rd, between, the, noon, hour, line, and, another, hour, line, is, given, by, the, formula, below, note, that, h, rd, displaystyle, h, text, rd, advances, counterclockwise, with, respect, to, the, zero, hour, angle, for, those, dials, that, are, partly, south, facing, and, clockwise, for, those, that, are, north, facing, within, the, parameter, ranges, d, d, c, displaystyle, d, d, c, and, 90, r, 90, l, displaystyle, 90, circ, r, 90, circ, l, or, if, preferring, to, use, inclination, angle, i, displaystyle, i, rather, than, the, reclination, r, displaystyle, r, where, i, 90, r, displaystyle, i, 90, circ, r, within, the, parameter, ranges, d, d, c, displaystyle, d, d, c, and, 0, i, 180, l, displaystyle, 0, circ, i, 180, circ, l, here, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, sundial, s, geographical, latitude, s, o, displaystyle, s, o, is, the, orientation, switch, integer, t, is, the, time, in, hours, before, or, after, noon, and, r, displaystyle, r, and, d, displaystyle, d, are, the, angles, of, reclination, and, declination, respectively, note, that, r, displaystyle, r, is, measured, with, reference, to, the, vertical, it, is, positive, when, the, dial, leans, back, towards, the, horizon, behind, the, dial, and, negative, when, the, dial, leans, forward, to, the, horizon, on, the, sun, s, side, declination, angle, d, displaystyle, d, is, defined, as, positive, when, moving, east, of, true, south, dials, facing, fully, or, partly, south, have, s, o, 1, displaystyle, s, o, 1, while, those, partly, or, fully, north, facing, have, an, s, o, 1, displaystyle, s, o, 1, since, the, above, expression, gives, the, hour, angle, as, an, arctangent, function, due, consideration, must, be, given, to, which, quadrant, of, the, sundial, each, hour, belongs, to, before, assigning, the, correct, hour, angle, unlike, the, simpler, vertical, declining, sundial, this, type, of, dial, does, not, always, show, hour, angles, on, its, sunside, face, for, all, declinations, between, east, and, west, when, a, northern, hemisphere, partly, south, facing, dial, reclines, back, i, e, away, from, the, sun, from, the, vertical, the, gnomon, will, become, co, planar, with, the, dial, plate, at, declinations, less, than, due, east, or, due, west, likewise, for, southern, hemisphere, dials, that, are, partly, north, facing, were, these, dials, reclining, forward, the, range, of, declination, would, actually, exceed, due, east, and, due, west, in, a, similar, way, northern, hemisphere, dials, that, are, partly, north, facing, and, southern, hemisphere, dials, that, are, south, facing, and, which, lean, forward, toward, their, upward, pointing, gnomons, will, have, a, similar, restriction, on, the, range, of, declination, that, is, possible, for, a, given, reclination, value, the, critical, declination, d, c, displaystyle, d, c, is, a, geometrical, constraint, which, depends, on, the, value, of, both, the, dial, s, reclination, and, its, latitude, as, with, the, vertical, declined, dial, the, gnomon, s, substyle, is, not, aligned, with, the, noon, hour, line, the, general, formula, for, the, angle, b, displaystyle, b, between, the, substyle, and, the, noon, line, is, given, by, the, angle, g, displaystyle, g, between, the, style, and, the, plate, is, given, by, note, that, for, g, 0, displaystyle, g, 0, circ, i, e, when, the, gnomon, is, coplanar, with, the, dial, plate, we, have, i, e, when, d, d, c, displaystyle, d, d, c, the, critical, declination, value, because, of, the, complexity, of, the, above, calculations, using, them, for, the, practical, purpose, of, designing, a, dial, of, this, type, is, difficult, and, prone, to, error, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, is, better, to, locate, the, hour, lines, empirically, marking, the, positions, of, the, shadow, of, a, style, on, a, real, sundial, at, hourly, intervals, as, shown, by, a, clock, and, adding, deducting, that, day, s, equation, of, time, adjustment, see, empirical, hour, line, marking, above, the, surface, receiving, the, shadow, need, not, be, a, plane, but, can, have, any, shape, provided, that, the, sundial, maker, is, willing, to, mark, the, hour, lines, if, the, style, is, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, a, spherical, shape, is, convenient, since, the, hour, lines, are, equally, spaced, as, they, are, on, the, equatorial, dial, shown, here, the, sundial, is, equiangular, this, is, the, principle, behind, the, armillary, sphere, and, the, equatorial, bow, sundial, however, some, equiangular, sundials, such, as, the, lambert, dial, described, below, are, based, on, other, principles, in, the, equatorial, bow, sundial, the, gnomon, is, a, bar, slot, or, stretched, wire, parallel, to, the, celestial, axis, the, face, is, a, semicircle, corresponding, to, the, equator, of, the, sphere, with, markings, on, the, inner, surface, this, pattern, built, a, couple, of, meters, wide, out, of, temperature, invariant, steel, invar, was, used, to, keep, the, trains, running, on, time, in, france, before, world, war, i, among, the, most, precise, sundials, ever, made, are, two, equatorial, bows, constructed, of, marble, found, in, yantra, mandir, this, collection, of, sundials, and, other, astronomical, instruments, was, built, by, maharaja, jai, singh, ii, at, his, then, new, capital, of, jaipur, india, between, 1727, and, 1733, the, larger, equatorial, bow, is, called, the, samrat, yantra, the, supreme, instrument, standing, at, 27, meters, its, shadow, moves, visibly, at, 1, mm, per, second, or, roughly, a, hand, s, breadth, 6, cm, every, minute, other, non, planar, surfaces, may, be, used, to, receive, the, shadow, of, the, gnomon, as, an, elegant, alternative, the, style, which, could, be, created, by, a, hole, or, slit, in, the, circumference, may, be, located, on, the, circumference, of, a, cylinder, or, sphere, rather, than, at, its, central, axis, of, symmetry, in, that, case, the, hour, lines, are, again, spaced, equally, but, at, twice, the, usual, angle, due, to, the, geometrical, inscribed, angle, theorem, this, is, the, basis, of, some, modern, sundials, but, it, was, also, used, in, ancient, times, in, another, variation, of, the, polar, axis, aligned, cylindrical, a, cylindrical, dial, could, be, rendered, as, a, helical, ribbon, like, surface, with, a, thin, gnomon, located, either, along, its, center, or, at, its, periphery, sundials, can, be, designed, with, a, gnomon, that, is, placed, in, a, different, position, each, day, throughout, the, year, in, other, words, the, position, of, the, gnomon, relative, to, the, centre, of, the, hour, lines, varies, the, gnomon, need, not, be, aligned, with, the, celestial, poles, and, may, even, be, perfectly, vertical, the, analemmatic, dial, these, dials, when, combined, with, fixed, gnomon, sundials, allow, the, user, to, determine, true, north, with, no, other, aid, the, two, sundials, are, correctly, aligned, if, and, only, if, they, both, show, the, same, time, a, universal, equinoctial, ring, dial, sometimes, called, a, ring, dial, for, brevity, although, the, term, is, ambiguous, is, a, portable, version, of, an, armillary, sundial, or, was, inspired, by, the, mariner, s, astrolabe, it, was, likely, invented, by, william, oughtred, around, 1600, and, became, common, throughout, europe, in, its, simplest, form, the, style, is, a, thin, slit, that, allows, the, sun, s, rays, to, fall, on, the, hour, lines, of, an, equatorial, ring, as, usual, the, style, is, aligned, with, the, earth, s, axis, to, do, this, the, user, may, orient, the, dial, towards, true, north, and, suspend, the, ring, dial, vertically, from, the, appropriate, point, on, the, meridian, ring, such, dials, may, be, made, self, aligning, with, the, addition, of, a, more, complicated, central, bar, instead, of, a, simple, slit, style, these, bars, are, sometimes, an, addition, to, a, set, of, gemma, s, rings, this, bar, could, pivot, about, its, end, points, and, held, a, perforated, slider, that, was, positioned, to, the, month, and, day, according, to, a, scale, scribed, on, the, bar, the, time, was, determined, by, rotating, the, bar, towards, the, sun, so, that, the, light, shining, through, the, hole, fell, on, the, equatorial, ring, this, forced, the, user, to, rotate, the, instrument, which, had, the, effect, of, aligning, the, instrument, s, vertical, ring, with, the, meridian, when, not, in, use, the, equatorial, and, meridian, rings, can, be, folded, together, into, a, small, disk, in, 1610, edward, wright, created, the, sea, ring, which, mounted, a, universal, ring, dial, over, a, magnetic, compass, this, permitted, mariners, to, determine, the, time, and, magnetic, variation, in, a, single, step, analemmatic, sundials, are, a, type, of, horizontal, sundial, that, has, a, vertical, gnomon, and, hour, markers, positioned, in, an, elliptical, pattern, there, are, no, hour, lines, on, the, dial, and, the, time, of, day, is, read, on, the, ellipse, the, gnomon, is, not, fixed, and, must, change, position, daily, to, accurately, indicate, time, of, day, analemmatic, sundials, are, sometimes, designed, with, a, human, as, the, gnomon, human, gnomon, analemmatic, sundials, are, not, practical, at, lower, latitudes, where, a, human, shadow, is, quite, short, during, the, summer, months, a, 66, inch, tall, person, casts, a, 4, inch, shadow, at, 27, latitude, on, the, summer, solstice, the, foster, lambert, dial, is, another, movable, gnomon, sundial, in, contrast, to, the, elliptical, analemmatic, dial, the, lambert, dial, is, circular, with, evenly, spaced, hour, lines, making, it, an, equiangular, sundial, similar, to, the, equatorial, spherical, cylindrical, and, conical, dials, described, above, the, gnomon, of, a, foster, lambert, dial, is, neither, vertical, nor, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, rather, it, is, tilted, northwards, by, an, angle, 45, 2, where, is, the, geographical, latitude, thus, a, foster, lambert, dial, located, at, latitude, 40, would, have, a, gnomon, tilted, away, from, vertical, by, 25, in, a, northerly, direction, to, read, the, correct, time, the, gnomon, must, also, be, moved, northwards, by, a, distance, where, r, is, the, radius, of, the, foster, lambert, dial, and, again, indicates, the, sun, s, declination, for, that, time, of, year, altitude, dials, measure, the, height, of, the, sun, in, the, sky, rather, than, directly, measuring, its, hour, angle, about, the, earth, s, axis, they, are, not, oriented, towards, true, north, but, rather, towards, the, sun, and, generally, held, vertically, the, sun, s, elevation, is, indicated, by, the, position, of, a, nodus, either, the, shadow, tip, of, a, gnomon, or, a, spot, of, light, in, altitude, dials, the, time, is, read, from, where, the, nodus, falls, on, a, set, of, hour, curves, that, vary, with, the, time, of, year, many, such, altitude, dials, construction, is, calculation, intensive, as, also, the, case, with, many, azimuth, dials, but, the, capuchin, dials, described, below, are, constructed, and, used, graphically, altitude, dials, disadvantages, since, the, sun, s, altitude, is, the, same, at, times, equally, spaced, about, noon, e, g, 9am, and, 3pm, the, user, had, to, know, whether, it, was, morning, or, afternoon, at, say, 3, 00, pm, that, is, not, a, problem, but, when, the, dial, indicates, a, time, 15, minutes, from, noon, the, user, likely, will, not, have, a, way, of, distinguishing, 11, 45, from, 12, 15, additionally, altitude, dials, are, less, accurate, near, noon, because, the, sun, s, altitude, is, not, changing, rapidly, then, many, of, these, dials, are, portable, and, simple, to, use, as, is, often, the, case, with, other, sundials, many, altitude, dials, are, designed, for, only, one, latitude, but, the, capuchin, dial, described, below, has, a, version, that, s, adjustable, for, latitude, mayall, mayall, 1994, p, 169, describe, the, universal, capuchin, sundial, the, length, of, a, human, shadow, or, of, any, vertical, object, can, be, used, to, measure, the, sun, s, elevation, and, thence, the, time, the, venerable, bede, gave, a, table, for, estimating, the, time, from, the, length, of, one, s, shadow, in, feet, on, the, assumption, that, a, monk, s, height, is, six, times, the, length, of, his, foot, such, shadow, lengths, will, vary, with, the, geographical, latitude, and, with, the, time, of, year, for, example, the, shadow, length, at, noon, is, short, in, summer, months, and, long, in, winter, months, chaucer, evokes, this, method, a, few, times, in, his, canterbury, tales, as, in, his, parson, s, tale, an, equivalent, type, of, sundial, using, a, vertical, rod, of, fixed, length, is, known, as, a, backstaff, dial, a, shepherd, s, dial, also, known, as, a, shepherd, s, column, dial, pillar, dial, cylinder, dial, or, chilindre, is, a, portable, cylindrical, sundial, with, a, knife, like, gnomon, that, juts, out, perpendicularly, it, is, normally, dangled, from, a, rope, or, string, so, the, cylinder, is, vertical, the, gnomon, can, be, twisted, to, be, above, a, month, or, day, indication, on, the, face, of, the, cylinder, this, corrects, the, sundial, for, the, equation, of, time, the, entire, sundial, is, then, twisted, on, its, string, so, that, the, gnomon, aims, toward, the, sun, while, the, cylinder, remains, vertical, the, tip, of, the, shadow, indicates, the, time, on, the, cylinder, the, hour, curves, inscribed, on, the, cylinder, permit, one, to, read, the, time, shepherd, s, dials, are, sometimes, hollow, so, that, the, gnomon, can, fold, within, when, not, in, use, the, shepherd, s, dial, is, evoked, in, henry, vi, part, 3, among, other, works, of, literature, the, cylindrical, shepherd, s, dial, can, be, unrolled, into, a, flat, plate, in, one, simple, version, the, front, and, back, of, the, plate, each, have, three, columns, corresponding, to, pairs, of, months, with, roughly, the, same, solar, declination, june, july, may, august, april, september, march, october, february, november, and, january, december, the, top, of, each, column, has, a, hole, for, inserting, the, shadow, casting, gnomon, a, peg, often, only, two, times, are, marked, on, the, column, below, one, for, noon, and, the, other, for, mid, morning, mid, afternoon, timesticks, clock, spear, or, shepherds, time, stick, are, based, on, the, same, principles, as, dials, the, time, stick, is, carved, with, eight, vertical, time, scales, for, a, different, period, of, the, year, each, bearing, a, time, scale, calculated, according, to, the, relative, amount, of, daylight, during, the, different, months, of, the, year, any, reading, depends, not, only, on, the, time, of, day, but, also, on, the, latitude, and, time, of, year, a, peg, gnomon, is, inserted, at, the, top, in, the, appropriate, hole, or, face, for, the, season, of, the, year, and, turned, to, the, sun, so, that, the, shadow, falls, directly, down, the, scale, its, end, displays, the, time, in, a, ring, dial, also, known, as, an, aquitaine, or, a, perforated, ring, dial, the, ring, is, hung, vertically, and, oriented, sideways, towards, the, sun, a, beam, of, light, passes, through, a, small, hole, in, the, ring, and, falls, on, hour, curves, that, are, inscribed, on, the, inside, of, the, ring, to, adjust, for, the, equation, of, time, the, hole, is, usually, on, a, loose, ring, within, the, ring, so, that, the, hole, can, be, adjusted, to, reflect, the, current, month, card, dials, are, another, form, of, altitude, dial, a, card, is, aligned, edge, on, with, the, sun, and, tilted, so, that, a, ray, of, light, passes, through, an, aperture, onto, a, specified, spot, thus, determining, the, sun, s, altitude, a, weighted, string, hangs, vertically, downwards, from, a, hole, in, the, card, and, carries, a, bead, or, knot, the, position, of, the, bead, on, the, hour, lines, of, the, card, gives, the, time, in, more, sophisticated, versions, such, as, the, capuchin, dial, there, is, only, one, set, of, hour, lines, i, e, the, hour, lines, do, not, vary, with, the, seasons, instead, the, position, of, the, hole, from, which, the, weighted, string, hangs, is, varied, according, to, the, season, the, capuchin, sundials, are, constructed, and, used, graphically, as, opposed, the, direct, hour, angle, measurements, of, horizontal, or, equatorial, dials, or, the, calculated, hour, angle, lines, of, some, altitude, and, azimuth, dials, in, addition, to, the, ordinary, capuchin, dial, there, is, a, universal, capuchin, dial, adjustable, for, latitude, a, navicula, de, venetiis, or, little, ship, of, venice, was, an, altitude, dial, used, to, tell, time, and, which, was, shaped, like, a, little, ship, the, cursor, with, a, plumb, line, attached, was, slid, up, down, the, mast, to, the, correct, latitude, the, user, then, sighted, the, sun, through, the, pair, of, sighting, holes, at, either, end, of, the, ship, s, deck, the, plumb, line, then, marked, what, hour, of, the, day, it, was, another, type, of, sundial, follows, the, motion, of, a, single, point, of, light, or, shadow, which, may, be, called, the, nodus, for, example, the, sundial, may, follow, the, sharp, tip, of, a, gnomon, s, shadow, e, g, the, shadow, tip, of, a, vertical, obelisk, e, g, the, solarium, augusti, or, the, tip, of, the, horizontal, marker, in, a, shepherd, s, dial, alternatively, sunlight, may, be, allowed, to, pass, through, a, small, hole, or, reflected, from, a, small, e, g, coin, sized, circular, mirror, forming, a, small, spot, of, light, whose, position, may, be, followed, in, such, cases, the, rays, of, light, trace, out, a, cone, over, the, course, of, a, day, when, the, rays, fall, on, a, surface, the, path, followed, is, the, intersection, of, the, cone, with, that, surface, most, commonly, the, receiving, surface, is, a, geometrical, plane, so, that, the, path, of, the, shadow, tip, or, light, spot, called, declination, line, traces, out, a, conic, section, such, as, a, hyperbola, or, an, ellipse, the, collection, of, hyperbolae, was, called, a, pelekonon, axe, by, the, greeks, because, it, resembles, a, double, bladed, ax, narrow, in, the, center, near, the, noonline, and, flaring, out, at, the, ends, early, morning, and, late, evening, hours, there, is, a, simple, verification, of, hyperbolic, declination, lines, on, a, sundial, the, distance, from, the, origin, to, the, equinox, line, should, be, equal, to, harmonic, mean, of, distances, from, the, origin, to, summer, and, winter, solstice, lines, nodus, based, sundials, may, use, a, small, hole, or, mirror, to, isolate, a, single, ray, of, light, the, former, are, sometimes, called, aperture, dials, the, oldest, example, is, perhaps, the, antiborean, sundial, antiboreum, a, spherical, nodus, based, sundial, that, faces, true, north, a, ray, of, sunlight, enters, from, the, south, through, a, small, hole, located, at, the, sphere, s, pole, and, falls, on, the, hour, and, date, lines, inscribed, within, the, sphere, which, resemble, lines, of, longitude, and, latitude, respectively, on, a, globe, isaac, newton, developed, a, convenient, and, inexpensive, sundial, in, which, a, small, mirror, is, placed, on, the, sill, of, a, south, facing, window, the, mirror, acts, like, a, nodus, casting, a, single, spot, of, light, on, the, ceiling, depending, on, the, geographical, latitude, and, time, of, year, the, light, spot, follows, a, conic, section, such, as, the, hyperbolae, of, the, pelikonon, if, the, mirror, is, parallel, to, the, earth, s, equator, and, the, ceiling, is, horizontal, then, the, resulting, angles, are, those, of, a, conventional, horizontal, sundial, using, the, ceiling, as, a, sundial, surface, exploits, unused, space, and, the, dial, may, be, large, enough, to, be, very, accurate, sundials, are, sometimes, combined, into, multiple, dials, if, two, or, more, dials, that, operate, on, different, principles, such, as, an, analemmatic, dial, and, a, horizontal, or, vertical, dial, are, combined, the, resulting, multiple, dial, becomes, self, aligning, most, of, the, time, both, dials, need, to, output, both, time, and, declination, in, other, words, the, direction, of, true, north, need, not, be, determined, the, dials, are, oriented, correctly, when, they, read, the, same, time, and, declination, however, the, most, common, forms, combine, dials, are, based, on, the, same, principle, and, the, analemmatic, does, not, normally, output, the, declination, of, the, sun, thus, are, not, self, aligning, the, diptych, consisted, of, two, small, flat, faces, joined, by, a, hinge, diptychs, usually, folded, into, little, flat, boxes, suitable, for, a, pocket, the, gnomon, was, a, string, between, the, two, faces, when, the, string, was, tight, the, two, faces, formed, both, a, vertical, and, horizontal, sundial, these, were, made, of, white, ivory, inlaid, with, black, lacquer, markings, the, gnomons, were, black, braided, silk, linen, or, hemp, string, with, a, knot, or, bead, on, the, string, as, a, nodus, and, the, correct, markings, a, diptych, really, any, sundial, large, enough, can, keep, a, calendar, well, enough, to, plant, crops, a, common, error, describes, the, diptych, dial, as, self, aligning, this, is, not, correct, for, diptych, dials, consisting, of, a, horizontal, and, vertical, dial, using, a, string, gnomon, between, faces, no, matter, the, orientation, of, the, dial, faces, since, the, string, gnomon, is, continuous, the, shadows, must, meet, at, the, hinge, hence, any, orientation, of, the, dial, will, show, the, same, time, on, both, dials, a, common, type, of, multiple, dial, has, sundials, on, every, face, of, a, platonic, solid, regular, polyhedron, usually, a, cube, extremely, ornate, sundials, can, be, composed, in, this, way, by, applying, a, sundial, to, every, surface, of, a, solid, object, in, some, cases, the, sundials, are, formed, as, hollows, in, a, solid, object, e, g, a, cylindrical, hollow, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, in, which, the, edges, play, the, role, of, styles, or, a, spherical, hollow, in, the, ancient, tradition, of, the, hemisphaerium, or, the, antiboreum, see, the, history, section, above, in, some, cases, these, multiface, dials, are, small, enough, to, sit, on, a, desk, whereas, in, others, they, are, large, stone, monuments, a, polyhedral, s, dial, faces, can, be, designed, to, give, the, time, for, different, time, zones, simultaneously, examples, include, the, scottish, sundial, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, which, was, often, an, extremely, complex, shape, of, polyhedral, and, even, convex, faces, prismatic, dials, are, a, special, case, of, polar, dials, in, which, the, sharp, edges, of, a, prism, of, a, concave, polygon, serve, as, the, styles, and, the, sides, of, the, prism, receive, the, shadow, examples, include, a, three, dimensional, cross, or, star, of, david, on, gravestones, the, benoy, dial, was, invented, by, walter, gordon, benoy, of, collingham, nottinghamshire, england, whereas, a, gnomon, casts, a, sheet, of, shadow, his, invention, creates, an, equivalent, sheet, of, light, by, allowing, the, sun, s, rays, through, a, thin, slit, reflecting, them, from, a, long, slim, mirror, usually, half, cylindrical, or, focusing, them, through, a, cylindrical, lens, examples, of, benoy, dials, can, be, found, in, the, united, kingdom, at, invented, by, the, german, mathematician, hugo, michnik, in, 1922, the, bifilar, sundial, has, two, non, intersecting, threads, parallel, to, the, dial, usually, the, second, thread, is, orthogonal, to, the, first, the, intersection, of, the, two, threads, shadows, gives, the, local, solar, time, a, digital, sundial, indicates, the, current, time, with, numerals, formed, by, the, sunlight, striking, it, sundials, of, this, type, are, installed, in, the, deutsches, museum, in, munich, and, in, the, sundial, park, in, genk, belgium, and, a, small, version, is, available, commercially, there, is, a, patent, for, this, type, of, sundial, the, globe, dial, is, a, sphere, aligned, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, and, equipped, with, a, spherical, vane, similar, to, sundials, with, a, fixed, axial, style, a, globe, dial, determines, the, time, from, the, sun, s, azimuthal, angle, in, its, apparent, rotation, about, the, earth, this, angle, can, be, determined, by, rotating, the, vane, to, give, the, smallest, shadow, the, simplest, sundials, do, not, give, the, hours, but, rather, note, the, exact, moment, of, 12, 00, noon, in, centuries, past, such, dials, were, used, to, set, mechanical, clocks, which, were, sometimes, so, inaccurate, as, to, lose, or, gain, significant, time, in, a, single, day, the, simplest, noon, marks, have, a, shadow, that, passes, a, mark, then, an, almanac, can, translate, from, local, solar, time, and, date, to, civil, time, the, civil, time, is, used, to, set, the, clock, some, noon, marks, include, a, figure, eight, that, embodies, the, equation, of, time, so, that, no, almanac, is, needed, in, some, u, s, colonial, era, houses, a, noon, mark, might, be, carved, into, a, floor, or, windowsill, such, marks, indicate, local, noon, and, provide, a, simple, and, accurate, time, reference, for, households, to, set, their, clocks, some, asian, countries, had, post, offices, set, their, clocks, from, a, precision, noon, mark, these, in, turn, provided, the, times, for, the, rest, of, the, society, the, typical, noon, mark, sundial, was, a, lens, set, above, an, analemmatic, plate, the, plate, has, an, engraved, figure, eight, shape, which, corresponds, to, the, equation, of, time, described, above, versus, the, solar, declination, when, the, edge, of, the, sun, s, image, touches, the, part, of, the, shape, for, the, current, month, this, indicates, that, it, is, 12, 00, noon, a, sundial, cannon, sometimes, called, a, meridian, cannon, is, a, specialized, sundial, that, is, designed, to, create, an, audible, noonmark, by, automatically, igniting, a, quantity, of, gunpowder, at, noon, these, were, novelties, rather, than, precision, sundials, sometimes, installed, in, parks, in, europe, mainly, in, the, late, 18th, or, early, 19th, centuries, they, typically, consist, of, a, horizontal, sundial, which, has, in, addition, to, a, gnomon, a, suitably, mounted, lens, set, to, focus, the, rays, of, the, sun, at, exactly, noon, on, the, firing, pan, of, a, miniature, cannon, loaded, with, gunpowder, but, no, ball, to, function, properly, the, position, and, angle, of, the, lens, must, be, adjusted, seasonally, a, horizontal, line, aligned, on, a, meridian, with, a, gnomon, facing, the, noon, sun, is, termed, a, meridian, line, and, does, not, indicate, the, time, but, instead, the, day, of, the, year, historically, they, were, used, to, accurately, determine, the, length, of, the, solar, year, examples, are, the, bianchini, meridian, line, in, santa, maria, degli, angeli, e, dei, martiri, in, rome, and, the, cassini, line, in, san, petronio, basilica, at, bologna, the, association, of, sundials, with, time, has, inspired, their, designers, over, the, centuries, to, display, mottoes, as, part, of, the, design, often, these, cast, the, device, in, the, role, of, memento, mori, inviting, the, observer, to, reflect, on, the, transience, of, the, world, and, the, inevitability, of, death, do, not, kill, time, for, it, will, surely, kill, thee, other, mottoes, are, more, whimsical, i, count, only, the, sunny, hours, and, i, am, a, sundial, and, i, make, a, botch, of, what, is, done, far, better, by, a, watch, collections, of, sundial, mottoes, have, often, been, published, through, the, centuries, if, a, horizontal, plate, sundial, is, made, for, the, latitude, in, which, it, is, being, used, and, if, it, is, mounted, with, its, plate, horizontal, and, its, gnomon, pointing, to, the, celestial, pole, that, is, above, the, horizon, then, it, shows, the, correct, time, in, apparent, solar, time, conversely, if, the, directions, of, the, cardinal, points, are, initially, unknown, but, the, sundial, is, aligned, so, it, shows, the, correct, apparent, solar, time, as, calculated, from, the, reading, of, a, clock, its, gnomon, shows, the, direction, of, true, north, or, south, allowing, the, sundial, to, be, used, as, a, compass, the, sundial, can, be, placed, on, a, horizontal, surface, and, rotated, about, a, vertical, axis, until, it, shows, the, correct, time, the, gnomon, will, then, be, pointing, to, the, north, in, the, northern, hemisphere, or, to, the, south, in, the, southern, hemisphere, this, method, is, much, more, accurate, than, using, a, watch, as, a, compass, see, cardinal, direction, watch, face, and, can, be, used, in, places, where, the, magnetic, declination, is, large, making, a, magnetic, compass, unreliable, an, alternative, method, uses, two, sundials, of, different, designs, see, multiple, dials, above, the, dials, are, attached, to, and, aligned, with, each, other, and, are, oriented, so, they, show, the, same, time, this, allows, the, directions, of, the, cardinal, points, and, the, apparent, solar, time, to, be, determined, simultaneously, without, requiring, a, clock
