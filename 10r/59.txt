a, central, processing, unit, cpu, also, called, a, central, processor, main, processor, or, just, processor, is, the, most, important, processor, in, a, given, computer, its, electronic, circuitry, executes, instructions, of, a, computer, program, such, as, arithmetic, logic, controlling, and, input, output, i, o, operations, this, role, contrasts, with, that, of, external, components, such, as, main, memory, and, i, o, circuitry, and, specialized, coprocessors, such, as, graphics, processing, units, gpus, the, form, design, and, implementation, of, cpus, have, changed, over, time, but, their, fundamental, operation, remains, almost, unchanged, principal, components, of, a, cpu, include, the, arithmetic, logic, unit, alu, that, performs, arithmetic, and, logic, operations, processor, registers, that, supply, operands, to, the, alu, and, store, the, results, of, alu, operations, and, a, control, unit, that, orchestrates, the, fetching, from, memory, decoding, and, execution, of, instructions, by, directing, the, coordinated, operations, of, the, alu, registers, and, other, components, modern, cpus, devote, a, lot, of, semiconductor, area, to, caches, and, instruction, level, parallelism, to, increase, performance, and, to, cpu, modes, to, support, operating, systems, and, virtualization, most, modern, cpus, are, implemented, on, integrated, circuit, ic, microprocessors, with, one, or, more, cpus, on, a, single, ic, chip, microprocessor, chips, with, multiple, cpus, are, called, multi, core, processors, the, individual, physical, cpus, called, processor, cores, can, also, be, multithreaded, to, support, cpu, level, multithreading, an, ic, that, contains, a, cpu, may, also, contain, memory, peripheral, interfaces, and, other, components, of, a, computer, such, integrated, devices, are, variously, called, microcontrollers, or, systems, on, a, chip, soc, early, computers, such, as, the, eniac, had, to, be, physically, rewired, to, perform, different, tasks, which, caused, these, machines, to, be, called, fixed, program, computers, the, central, processing, unit, term, has, been, in, use, since, as, early, as, 1955, since, the, term, cpu, is, generally, defined, as, a, device, for, software, computer, program, execution, the, earliest, devices, that, could, rightly, be, called, cpus, came, with, the, advent, of, the, stored, program, computer, the, idea, of, a, stored, program, computer, had, been, already, present, in, the, design, of, j, presper, eckert, and, john, william, mauchly, s, eniac, but, was, initially, omitted, so, that, eniac, could, be, finished, sooner, on, june, 30, 1945, before, eniac, was, made, mathematician, john, von, neumann, distributed, a, paper, entitled, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, it, was, the, outline, of, a, stored, program, computer, that, would, eventually, be, completed, in, august, 1949, edvac, was, designed, to, perform, a, certain, number, of, instructions, or, operations, of, various, types, significantly, the, programs, written, for, edvac, were, to, be, stored, in, high, speed, computer, memory, rather, than, specified, by, the, physical, wiring, of, the, computer, this, overcame, a, severe, limitation, of, eniac, which, was, the, considerable, time, and, effort, required, to, reconfigure, the, computer, to, perform, a, new, task, with, von, neumann, s, design, the, program, that, edvac, ran, could, be, changed, simply, by, changing, the, contents, of, the, memory, edvac, was, not, the, first, stored, program, computer, the, manchester, baby, which, was, a, small, scale, experimental, stored, program, computer, ran, its, first, program, on, 21, june, 1948, and, the, manchester, mark, 1, ran, its, first, program, during, the, night, of, 16, 17, june, 1949, early, cpus, were, custom, designs, used, as, part, of, a, larger, and, sometimes, distinctive, computer, however, this, method, of, designing, custom, cpus, for, a, particular, application, has, largely, given, way, to, the, development, of, multi, purpose, processors, produced, in, large, quantities, this, standardization, began, in, the, era, of, discrete, transistor, mainframes, and, minicomputers, and, has, rapidly, accelerated, with, the, popularization, of, the, integrated, circuit, ic, the, ic, has, allowed, increasingly, complex, cpus, to, be, designed, and, manufactured, to, tolerances, on, the, order, of, nanometers, both, the, miniaturization, and, standardization, of, cpus, have, increased, the, presence, of, digital, devices, in, modern, life, far, beyond, the, limited, application, of, dedicated, computing, machines, modern, microprocessors, appear, in, electronic, devices, ranging, from, automobiles, to, cellphones, and, sometimes, even, in, toys, while, von, neumann, is, most, often, credited, with, the, design, of, the, stored, program, computer, because, of, his, design, of, edvac, and, the, design, became, known, as, the, von, neumann, architecture, others, before, him, such, as, konrad, zuse, had, suggested, and, implemented, similar, ideas, the, so, called, harvard, architecture, of, the, harvard, mark, i, which, was, completed, before, edvac, also, used, a, stored, program, design, using, punched, paper, tape, rather, than, electronic, memory, the, key, difference, between, the, von, neumann, and, harvard, architectures, is, that, the, latter, separates, the, storage, and, treatment, of, cpu, instructions, and, data, while, the, former, uses, the, same, memory, space, for, both, most, modern, cpus, are, primarily, von, neumann, in, design, but, cpus, with, the, harvard, architecture, are, seen, as, well, especially, in, embedded, applications, for, instance, the, atmel, avr, microcontrollers, are, harvard, architecture, processors, relays, and, vacuum, tubes, thermionic, tubes, were, commonly, used, as, switching, elements, a, useful, computer, requires, thousands, or, tens, of, thousands, of, switching, devices, the, overall, speed, of, a, system, is, dependent, on, the, speed, of, the, switches, vacuum, tube, computers, such, as, edvac, tended, to, average, eight, hours, between, failures, whereas, relay, computers, such, as, the, slower, but, earlier, harvard, mark, i, failed, very, rarely, in, the, end, tube, based, cpus, became, dominant, because, the, significant, speed, advantages, afforded, generally, outweighed, the, reliability, problems, most, of, these, early, synchronous, cpus, ran, at, low, clock, rates, compared, to, modern, microelectronic, designs, clock, signal, frequencies, ranging, from, 100, khz, to, 4, mhz, were, very, common, at, this, time, limited, largely, by, the, speed, of, the, switching, devices, they, were, built, with, the, design, complexity, of, cpus, increased, as, various, technologies, facilitated, the, building, of, smaller, and, more, reliable, electronic, devices, the, first, such, improvement, came, with, the, advent, of, the, transistor, transistorized, cpus, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, no, longer, had, to, be, built, out, of, bulky, unreliable, and, fragile, switching, elements, like, vacuum, tubes, and, relays, with, this, improvement, more, complex, and, reliable, cpus, were, built, onto, one, or, several, printed, circuit, boards, containing, discrete, individual, components, in, 1964, ibm, introduced, its, ibm, system, 360, computer, architecture, that, was, used, in, a, series, of, computers, capable, of, running, the, same, programs, with, different, speeds, and, performances, this, was, significant, at, a, time, when, most, electronic, computers, were, incompatible, with, one, another, even, those, made, by, the, same, manufacturer, to, facilitate, this, improvement, ibm, used, the, concept, of, a, microprogram, often, called, microcode, which, still, sees, widespread, use, in, modern, cpus, the, system, 360, architecture, was, so, popular, that, it, dominated, the, mainframe, computer, market, for, decades, and, left, a, legacy, that, is, continued, by, similar, modern, computers, like, the, ibm, zseries, in, 1965, digital, equipment, corporation, dec, introduced, another, influential, computer, aimed, at, the, scientific, and, research, markets, the, pdp, 8, transistor, based, computers, had, several, distinct, advantages, over, their, predecessors, aside, from, facilitating, increased, reliability, and, lower, power, consumption, transistors, also, allowed, cpus, to, operate, at, much, higher, speeds, because, of, the, short, switching, time, of, a, transistor, in, comparison, to, a, tube, or, relay, the, increased, reliability, and, dramatically, increased, speed, of, the, switching, elements, which, were, almost, exclusively, transistors, by, this, time, cpu, clock, rates, in, the, tens, of, megahertz, were, easily, obtained, during, this, period, additionally, while, discrete, transistor, and, ic, cpus, were, in, heavy, usage, new, high, performance, designs, like, single, instruction, multiple, data, simd, vector, processors, began, to, appear, these, early, experimental, designs, later, gave, rise, to, the, era, of, specialized, supercomputers, like, those, made, by, cray, inc, and, fujitsu, ltd, during, this, period, a, method, of, manufacturing, many, interconnected, transistors, in, a, compact, space, was, developed, the, integrated, circuit, ic, allowed, a, large, number, of, transistors, to, be, manufactured, on, a, single, semiconductor, based, die, or, chip, at, first, only, very, basic, non, specialized, digital, circuits, such, as, nor, gates, were, miniaturized, into, ics, cpus, based, on, these, building, block, ics, are, generally, referred, to, as, small, scale, integration, ssi, devices, ssi, ics, such, as, the, ones, used, in, the, apollo, guidance, computer, usually, contained, up, to, a, few, dozen, transistors, to, build, an, entire, cpu, out, of, ssi, ics, required, thousands, of, individual, chips, but, still, consumed, much, less, space, and, power, than, earlier, discrete, transistor, designs, ibm, s, system, 370, follow, on, to, the, system, 360, used, ssi, ics, rather, than, solid, logic, technology, discrete, transistor, modules, dec, s, pdp, 8, i, and, ki10, pdp, 10, also, switched, from, the, individual, transistors, used, by, the, pdp, 8, and, pdp, 10, to, ssi, ics, and, their, extremely, popular, pdp, 11, line, was, originally, built, with, ssi, ics, but, was, eventually, implemented, with, lsi, components, once, these, became, practical, lee, boysel, published, influential, articles, including, a, 1967, manifesto, which, described, how, to, build, the, equivalent, of, a, 32, bit, mainframe, computer, from, a, relatively, small, number, of, large, scale, integration, circuits, lsi, the, only, way, to, build, lsi, chips, which, are, chips, with, a, hundred, or, more, gates, was, to, build, them, using, a, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, semiconductor, manufacturing, process, either, pmos, logic, nmos, logic, or, cmos, logic, however, some, companies, continued, to, build, processors, out, of, bipolar, transistor, transistor, logic, ttl, chips, because, bipolar, junction, transistors, were, faster, than, mos, chips, up, until, the, 1970s, a, few, companies, such, as, datapoint, continued, to, build, processors, out, of, ttl, chips, until, the, early, 1980s, in, the, 1960s, mos, ics, were, slower, and, initially, considered, useful, only, in, applications, that, required, low, power, following, the, development, of, silicon, gate, mos, technology, by, federico, faggin, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1968, mos, ics, largely, replaced, bipolar, ttl, as, the, standard, chip, technology, in, the, early, 1970s, as, the, microelectronic, technology, advanced, an, increasing, number, of, transistors, were, placed, on, ics, decreasing, the, number, of, individual, ics, needed, for, a, complete, cpu, msi, and, lsi, ics, increased, transistor, counts, to, hundreds, and, then, thousands, by, 1968, the, number, of, ics, required, to, build, a, complete, cpu, had, been, reduced, to, 24, ics, of, eight, different, types, with, each, ic, containing, roughly, 1000, mosfets, in, stark, contrast, with, its, ssi, and, msi, predecessors, the, first, lsi, implementation, of, the, pdp, 11, contained, a, cpu, composed, of, only, four, lsi, integrated, circuits, since, microprocessors, were, first, introduced, they, have, almost, completely, overtaken, all, other, central, processing, unit, implementation, methods, the, first, commercially, available, microprocessor, made, in, 1971, was, the, intel, 4004, and, the, first, widely, used, microprocessor, made, in, 1974, was, the, intel, 8080, mainframe, and, minicomputer, manufacturers, of, the, time, launched, proprietary, ic, development, programs, to, upgrade, their, older, computer, architectures, and, eventually, produced, instruction, set, compatible, microprocessors, that, were, backward, compatible, with, their, older, hardware, and, software, combined, with, the, advent, and, eventual, success, of, the, ubiquitous, personal, computer, the, term, cpu, is, now, applied, almost, exclusively, to, microprocessors, several, cpus, denoted, cores, can, be, combined, in, a, single, processing, chip, previous, generations, of, cpus, were, implemented, as, discrete, components, and, numerous, small, integrated, circuits, ics, on, one, or, more, circuit, boards, microprocessors, on, the, other, hand, are, cpus, manufactured, on, a, very, small, number, of, ics, usually, just, one, the, overall, smaller, cpu, size, as, a, result, of, being, implemented, on, a, single, die, means, faster, switching, time, because, of, physical, factors, like, decreased, gate, parasitic, capacitance, this, has, allowed, synchronous, microprocessors, to, have, clock, rates, ranging, from, tens, of, megahertz, to, several, gigahertz, additionally, the, ability, to, construct, exceedingly, small, transistors, on, an, ic, has, increased, the, complexity, and, number, of, transistors, in, a, single, cpu, many, fold, this, widely, observed, trend, is, described, by, moore, s, law, which, had, proven, to, be, a, fairly, accurate, predictor, of, the, growth, of, cpu, and, other, ic, complexity, until, 2016, while, the, complexity, size, construction, and, general, form, of, cpus, have, changed, enormously, since, 1950, the, basic, design, and, function, has, not, changed, much, at, all, almost, all, common, cpus, today, can, be, very, accurately, described, as, von, neumann, stored, program, machines, as, moore, s, law, no, longer, holds, concerns, have, arisen, about, the, limits, of, integrated, circuit, transistor, technology, extreme, miniaturization, of, electronic, gates, is, causing, the, effects, of, phenomena, like, electromigration, and, subthreshold, leakage, to, become, much, more, significant, these, newer, concerns, are, among, the, many, factors, causing, researchers, to, investigate, new, methods, of, computing, such, as, the, quantum, computer, as, well, as, to, expand, the, use, of, parallelism, and, other, methods, that, extend, the, usefulness, of, the, classical, von, neumann, model, the, fundamental, operation, of, most, cpus, regardless, of, the, physical, form, they, take, is, to, execute, a, sequence, of, stored, instructions, that, is, called, a, program, the, instructions, to, be, executed, are, kept, in, some, kind, of, computer, memory, nearly, all, cpus, follow, the, fetch, decode, and, execute, steps, in, their, operation, which, are, collectively, known, as, the, instruction, cycle, after, the, execution, of, an, instruction, the, entire, process, repeats, with, the, next, instruction, cycle, normally, fetching, the, next, in, sequence, instruction, because, of, the, incremented, value, in, the, program, counter, if, a, jump, instruction, was, executed, the, program, counter, will, be, modified, to, contain, the, address, of, the, instruction, that, was, jumped, to, and, program, execution, continues, normally, in, more, complex, cpus, multiple, instructions, can, be, fetched, decoded, and, executed, simultaneously, this, section, describes, what, is, generally, referred, to, as, the, classic, risc, pipeline, which, is, quite, common, among, the, simple, cpus, used, in, many, electronic, devices, often, called, microcontrollers, it, largely, ignores, the, important, role, of, cpu, cache, and, therefore, the, access, stage, of, the, pipeline, some, instructions, manipulate, the, program, counter, rather, than, producing, result, data, directly, such, instructions, are, generally, called, jumps, and, facilitate, program, behavior, like, loops, conditional, program, execution, through, the, use, of, a, conditional, jump, and, existence, of, functions, in, some, processors, some, other, instructions, change, the, state, of, bits, in, a, flags, register, these, flags, can, be, used, to, influence, how, a, program, behaves, since, they, often, indicate, the, outcome, of, various, operations, for, example, in, such, processors, a, compare, instruction, evaluates, two, values, and, sets, or, clears, bits, in, the, flags, register, to, indicate, which, one, is, greater, or, whether, they, are, equal, one, of, these, flags, could, then, be, used, by, a, later, jump, instruction, to, determine, program, flow, fetch, involves, retrieving, an, instruction, which, is, represented, by, a, number, or, sequence, of, numbers, from, program, memory, the, instruction, s, location, address, in, program, memory, is, determined, by, the, program, counter, pc, called, the, instruction, pointer, in, intel, x86, microprocessors, which, stores, a, number, that, identifies, the, address, of, the, next, instruction, to, be, fetched, after, an, instruction, is, fetched, the, pc, is, incremented, by, the, length, of, the, instruction, so, that, it, will, contain, the, address, of, the, next, instruction, in, the, sequence, often, the, instruction, to, be, fetched, must, be, retrieved, from, relatively, slow, memory, causing, the, cpu, to, stall, while, waiting, for, the, instruction, to, be, returned, this, issue, is, largely, addressed, in, modern, processors, by, caches, and, pipeline, architectures, see, below, the, instruction, that, the, cpu, fetches, from, memory, determines, what, the, cpu, will, do, in, the, decode, step, performed, by, binary, decoder, circuitry, known, as, the, instruction, decoder, the, instruction, is, converted, into, signals, that, control, other, parts, of, the, cpu, the, way, in, which, the, instruction, is, interpreted, is, defined, by, the, cpu, s, instruction, set, architecture, isa, often, one, group, of, bits, that, is, a, field, within, the, instruction, called, the, opcode, indicates, which, operation, is, to, be, performed, while, the, remaining, fields, usually, provide, supplemental, information, required, for, the, operation, such, as, the, operands, those, operands, may, be, specified, as, a, constant, value, called, an, immediate, value, or, as, the, location, of, a, value, that, may, be, a, processor, register, or, a, memory, address, as, determined, by, some, addressing, mode, in, some, cpu, designs, the, instruction, decoder, is, implemented, as, a, hardwired, unchangeable, binary, decoder, circuit, in, others, a, microprogram, is, used, to, translate, instructions, into, sets, of, cpu, configuration, signals, that, are, applied, sequentially, over, multiple, clock, pulses, in, some, cases, the, memory, that, stores, the, microprogram, is, rewritable, making, it, possible, to, change, the, way, in, which, the, cpu, decodes, instructions, after, the, fetch, and, decode, steps, the, execute, step, is, performed, depending, on, the, cpu, architecture, this, may, consist, of, a, single, action, or, a, sequence, of, actions, during, each, action, control, signals, electrically, enable, or, disable, various, parts, of, the, cpu, so, they, can, perform, all, or, part, of, the, desired, operation, the, action, is, then, completed, typically, in, response, to, a, clock, pulse, very, often, the, results, are, written, to, an, internal, cpu, register, for, quick, access, by, subsequent, instructions, in, other, cases, results, may, be, written, to, slower, but, less, expensive, and, higher, capacity, main, memory, for, example, if, an, instruction, that, performs, addition, is, to, be, executed, registers, containing, operands, numbers, to, be, summed, are, activated, as, are, the, parts, of, the, arithmetic, logic, unit, alu, that, perform, addition, when, the, clock, pulse, occurs, the, operands, flow, from, the, source, registers, into, the, alu, and, the, sum, appears, at, its, output, on, subsequent, clock, pulses, other, components, are, enabled, and, disabled, to, move, the, output, the, sum, of, the, operation, to, storage, e, g, a, register, or, memory, if, the, resulting, sum, is, too, large, i, e, it, is, larger, than, the, alu, s, output, word, size, an, arithmetic, overflow, flag, will, be, set, influencing, the, next, operation, hardwired, into, a, cpu, s, circuitry, is, a, set, of, basic, operations, it, can, perform, called, an, instruction, set, such, operations, may, involve, for, example, adding, or, subtracting, two, numbers, comparing, two, numbers, or, jumping, to, a, different, part, of, a, program, each, instruction, is, represented, by, a, unique, combination, of, bits, known, as, the, machine, language, opcode, while, processing, an, instruction, the, cpu, decodes, the, opcode, via, a, binary, decoder, into, control, signals, which, orchestrate, the, behavior, of, the, cpu, a, complete, machine, language, instruction, consists, of, an, opcode, and, in, many, cases, additional, bits, that, specify, arguments, for, the, operation, for, example, the, numbers, to, be, summed, in, the, case, of, an, addition, operation, going, up, the, complexity, scale, a, machine, language, program, is, a, collection, of, machine, language, instructions, that, the, cpu, executes, the, actual, mathematical, operation, for, each, instruction, is, performed, by, a, combinational, logic, circuit, within, the, cpu, s, processor, known, as, the, arithmetic, logic, unit, or, alu, in, general, a, cpu, executes, an, instruction, by, fetching, it, from, memory, using, its, alu, to, perform, an, operation, and, then, storing, the, result, to, memory, besides, the, instructions, for, integer, mathematics, and, logic, operations, various, other, machine, instructions, exist, such, as, those, for, loading, data, from, memory, and, storing, it, back, branching, operations, and, mathematical, operations, on, floating, point, numbers, performed, by, the, cpu, s, floating, point, unit, fpu, the, control, unit, cu, is, a, component, of, the, cpu, that, directs, the, operation, of, the, processor, it, tells, the, computer, s, memory, arithmetic, and, logic, unit, and, input, and, output, devices, how, to, respond, to, the, instructions, that, have, been, sent, to, the, processor, it, directs, the, operation, of, the, other, units, by, providing, timing, and, control, signals, most, computer, resources, are, managed, by, the, cu, it, directs, the, flow, of, data, between, the, cpu, and, the, other, devices, john, von, neumann, included, the, control, unit, as, part, of, the, von, neumann, architecture, in, modern, computer, designs, the, control, unit, is, typically, an, internal, part, of, the, cpu, with, its, overall, role, and, operation, unchanged, since, its, introduction, the, arithmetic, logic, unit, alu, is, a, digital, circuit, within, the, processor, that, performs, integer, arithmetic, and, bitwise, logic, operations, the, inputs, to, the, alu, are, the, data, words, to, be, operated, on, called, operands, status, information, from, previous, operations, and, a, code, from, the, control, unit, indicating, which, operation, to, perform, depending, on, the, instruction, being, executed, the, operands, may, come, from, internal, cpu, registers, external, memory, or, constants, generated, by, the, alu, itself, when, all, input, signals, have, settled, and, propagated, through, the, alu, circuitry, the, result, of, the, performed, operation, appears, at, the, alu, s, outputs, the, result, consists, of, both, a, data, word, which, may, be, stored, in, a, register, or, memory, and, status, information, that, is, typically, stored, in, a, special, internal, cpu, register, reserved, for, this, purpose, modern, cpus, typically, contain, more, than, one, alu, to, improve, performance, the, address, generation, unit, agu, sometimes, also, called, the, address, computation, unit, acu, is, an, execution, unit, inside, the, cpu, that, calculates, addresses, used, by, the, cpu, to, access, main, memory, by, having, address, calculations, handled, by, separate, circuitry, that, operates, in, parallel, with, the, rest, of, the, cpu, the, number, of, cpu, cycles, required, for, executing, various, machine, instructions, can, be, reduced, bringing, performance, improvements, while, performing, various, operations, cpus, need, to, calculate, memory, addresses, required, for, fetching, data, from, the, memory, for, example, in, memory, positions, of, array, elements, must, be, calculated, before, the, cpu, can, fetch, the, data, from, actual, memory, locations, those, address, generation, calculations, involve, different, integer, arithmetic, operations, such, as, addition, subtraction, modulo, operations, or, bit, shifts, often, calculating, a, memory, address, involves, more, than, one, general, purpose, machine, instruction, which, do, not, necessarily, decode, and, execute, quickly, by, incorporating, an, agu, into, a, cpu, design, together, with, introducing, specialized, instructions, that, use, the, agu, various, address, generation, calculations, can, be, offloaded, from, the, rest, of, the, cpu, and, can, often, be, executed, quickly, in, a, single, cpu, cycle, capabilities, of, an, agu, depend, on, a, particular, cpu, and, its, architecture, thus, some, agus, implement, and, expose, more, address, calculation, operations, while, some, also, include, more, advanced, specialized, instructions, that, can, operate, on, multiple, operands, at, a, time, some, cpu, architectures, include, multiple, agus, so, more, than, one, address, calculation, operation, can, be, executed, simultaneously, which, brings, further, performance, improvements, due, to, the, superscalar, nature, of, advanced, cpu, designs, for, example, intel, incorporates, multiple, agus, into, its, sandy, bridge, and, haswell, microarchitectures, which, increase, bandwidth, of, the, cpu, memory, subsystem, by, allowing, multiple, memory, access, instructions, to, be, executed, in, parallel, many, microprocessors, in, smartphones, and, desktop, laptop, server, computers, have, a, memory, management, unit, translating, logical, addresses, into, physical, ram, addresses, providing, memory, protection, and, paging, abilities, useful, for, virtual, memory, simpler, processors, especially, microcontrollers, usually, don, t, include, an, mmu, a, cpu, cache, is, a, hardware, cache, used, by, the, central, processing, unit, cpu, of, a, computer, to, reduce, the, average, cost, time, or, energy, to, access, data, from, the, main, memory, a, cache, is, a, smaller, faster, memory, closer, to, a, processor, core, which, stores, copies, of, the, data, from, frequently, used, main, memory, locations, most, cpus, have, different, independent, caches, including, instruction, and, data, caches, where, the, data, cache, is, usually, organized, as, a, hierarchy, of, more, cache, levels, l1, l2, l3, l4, etc, all, modern, fast, cpus, with, few, specialized, exceptions, have, multiple, levels, of, cpu, caches, the, first, cpus, that, used, a, cache, had, only, one, level, of, cache, unlike, later, level, 1, caches, it, was, not, split, into, l1d, for, data, and, l1i, for, instructions, almost, all, current, cpus, with, caches, have, a, split, l1, cache, they, also, have, l2, caches, and, for, larger, processors, l3, caches, as, well, the, l2, cache, is, usually, not, split, and, acts, as, a, common, repository, for, the, already, split, l1, cache, every, core, of, a, multi, core, processor, has, a, dedicated, l2, cache, and, is, usually, not, shared, between, the, cores, the, l3, cache, and, higher, level, caches, are, shared, between, the, cores, and, are, not, split, an, l4, cache, is, currently, uncommon, and, is, generally, on, dynamic, random, access, memory, dram, rather, than, on, static, random, access, memory, sram, on, a, separate, die, or, chip, that, was, also, the, case, historically, with, l1, while, bigger, chips, have, allowed, integration, of, it, and, generally, all, cache, levels, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, last, level, each, extra, level, of, cache, tends, to, be, bigger, and, is, optimized, differently, other, types, of, caches, exist, that, are, not, counted, towards, the, cache, size, of, the, most, important, caches, mentioned, above, such, as, the, translation, lookaside, buffer, tlb, that, is, part, of, the, memory, management, unit, mmu, that, most, cpus, have, caches, are, generally, sized, in, powers, of, two, 2, 8, 16, etc, kib, or, mib, for, larger, non, l1, sizes, although, the, ibm, z13, has, a, 96, kib, l1, instruction, cache, most, cpus, are, synchronous, circuits, which, means, they, employ, a, clock, signal, to, pace, their, sequential, operations, the, clock, signal, is, produced, by, an, external, oscillator, circuit, that, generates, a, consistent, number, of, pulses, each, second, in, the, form, of, a, periodic, square, wave, the, frequency, of, the, clock, pulses, determines, the, rate, at, which, a, cpu, executes, instructions, and, consequently, the, faster, the, clock, the, more, instructions, the, cpu, will, execute, each, second, to, ensure, proper, operation, of, the, cpu, the, clock, period, is, longer, than, the, maximum, time, needed, for, all, signals, to, propagate, move, through, the, cpu, in, setting, the, clock, period, to, a, value, well, above, the, worst, case, propagation, delay, it, is, possible, to, design, the, entire, cpu, and, the, way, it, moves, data, around, the, edges, of, the, rising, and, falling, clock, signal, this, has, the, advantage, of, simplifying, the, cpu, significantly, both, from, a, design, perspective, and, a, component, count, perspective, however, it, also, carries, the, disadvantage, that, the, entire, cpu, must, wait, on, its, slowest, elements, even, though, some, portions, of, it, are, much, faster, this, limitation, has, largely, been, compensated, for, by, various, methods, of, increasing, cpu, parallelism, see, below, however, architectural, improvements, alone, do, not, solve, all, of, the, drawbacks, of, globally, synchronous, cpus, for, example, a, clock, signal, is, subject, to, the, delays, of, any, other, electrical, signal, higher, clock, rates, in, increasingly, complex, cpus, make, it, more, difficult, to, keep, the, clock, signal, in, phase, synchronized, throughout, the, entire, unit, this, has, led, many, modern, cpus, to, require, multiple, identical, clock, signals, to, be, provided, to, avoid, delaying, a, single, signal, significantly, enough, to, cause, the, cpu, to, malfunction, another, major, issue, as, clock, rates, increase, dramatically, is, the, amount, of, heat, that, is, dissipated, by, the, cpu, the, constantly, changing, clock, causes, many, components, to, switch, regardless, of, whether, they, are, being, used, at, that, time, in, general, a, component, that, is, switching, uses, more, energy, than, an, element, in, a, static, state, therefore, as, clock, rate, increases, so, does, energy, consumption, causing, the, cpu, to, require, more, heat, dissipation, in, the, form, of, cpu, cooling, solutions, one, method, of, dealing, with, the, switching, of, unneeded, components, is, called, clock, gating, which, involves, turning, off, the, clock, signal, to, unneeded, components, effectively, disabling, them, however, this, is, often, regarded, as, difficult, to, implement, and, therefore, does, not, see, common, usage, outside, of, very, low, power, designs, one, notable, recent, cpu, design, that, uses, extensive, clock, gating, is, the, ibm, powerpc, based, xenon, used, in, the, xbox, 360, this, reduces, the, power, requirements, of, the, xbox, 360, another, method, of, addressing, some, of, the, problems, with, a, global, clock, signal, is, the, removal, of, the, clock, signal, altogether, while, removing, the, global, clock, signal, makes, the, design, process, considerably, more, complex, in, many, ways, asynchronous, or, clockless, designs, carry, marked, advantages, in, power, consumption, and, heat, dissipation, in, comparison, with, similar, synchronous, designs, while, somewhat, uncommon, entire, asynchronous, cpus, have, been, built, without, using, a, global, clock, signal, two, notable, examples, of, this, are, the, arm, compliant, amulet, and, the, mips, r3000, compatible, minimips, rather, than, totally, removing, the, clock, signal, some, cpu, designs, allow, certain, portions, of, the, device, to, be, asynchronous, such, as, using, asynchronous, alus, in, conjunction, with, superscalar, pipelining, to, achieve, some, arithmetic, performance, gains, while, it, is, not, altogether, clear, whether, totally, asynchronous, designs, can, perform, at, a, comparable, or, better, level, than, their, synchronous, counterparts, it, is, evident, that, they, do, at, least, excel, in, simpler, math, operations, this, combined, with, their, excellent, power, consumption, and, heat, dissipation, properties, makes, them, very, suitable, for, embedded, computers, many, modern, cpus, have, a, die, integrated, power, managing, module, which, regulates, on, demand, voltage, supply, to, the, cpu, circuitry, allowing, it, to, keep, balance, between, performance, and, power, consumption, every, cpu, represents, numerical, values, in, a, specific, way, for, example, some, early, digital, computers, represented, numbers, as, familiar, decimal, base, 10, numeral, system, values, and, others, have, employed, more, unusual, representations, such, as, ternary, base, three, nearly, all, modern, cpus, represent, numbers, in, binary, form, with, each, digit, being, represented, by, some, two, valued, physical, quantity, such, as, a, high, or, low, voltage, related, to, numeric, representation, is, the, size, and, precision, of, integer, numbers, that, a, cpu, can, represent, in, the, case, of, a, binary, cpu, this, is, measured, by, the, number, of, bits, significant, digits, of, a, binary, encoded, integer, that, the, cpu, can, process, in, one, operation, which, is, commonly, called, word, size, bit, width, data, path, width, integer, precision, or, integer, size, a, cpu, s, integer, size, determines, the, range, of, integer, values, on, which, it, can, directly, operate, for, example, an, 8, bit, cpu, can, directly, manipulate, integers, represented, by, eight, bits, which, have, a, range, of, 256, 2, 8, discrete, integer, values, integer, range, can, also, affect, the, number, of, memory, locations, the, cpu, can, directly, address, an, address, is, an, integer, value, representing, a, specific, memory, location, for, example, if, a, binary, cpu, uses, 32, bits, to, represent, a, memory, address, then, it, can, directly, address, 2, 32, memory, locations, to, circumvent, this, limitation, and, for, various, other, reasons, some, cpus, use, mechanisms, such, as, bank, switching, that, allow, additional, memory, to, be, addressed, cpus, with, larger, word, sizes, require, more, circuitry, and, consequently, are, physically, larger, cost, more, and, consume, more, power, and, therefore, generate, more, heat, as, a, result, smaller, 4, or, 8, bit, microcontrollers, are, commonly, used, in, modern, applications, even, though, cpus, with, much, larger, word, sizes, such, as, 16, 32, 64, even, 128, bit, are, available, when, higher, performance, is, required, however, the, benefits, of, a, larger, word, size, larger, data, ranges, and, address, spaces, may, outweigh, the, disadvantages, a, cpu, can, have, internal, data, paths, shorter, than, the, word, size, to, reduce, size, and, cost, for, example, even, though, the, ibm, system, 360, instruction, set, architecture, was, a, 32, bit, instruction, set, the, system, 360, model, 30, and, model, 40, had, 8, bit, data, paths, in, the, arithmetic, logical, unit, so, that, a, 32, bit, add, required, four, cycles, one, for, each, 8, bits, of, the, operands, and, even, though, the, motorola, 68000, series, instruction, set, was, a, 32, bit, instruction, set, the, motorola, 68000, and, motorola, 68010, had, 16, bit, data, paths, in, the, arithmetic, logical, unit, so, that, a, 32, bit, add, required, two, cycles, to, gain, some, of, the, advantages, afforded, by, both, lower, and, higher, bit, lengths, many, instruction, sets, have, different, bit, widths, for, integer, and, floating, point, data, allowing, cpus, implementing, that, instruction, set, to, have, different, bit, widths, for, different, portions, of, the, device, for, example, the, ibm, system, 360, instruction, set, was, primarily, 32, bit, but, supported, 64, bit, floating, point, values, to, facilitate, greater, accuracy, and, range, in, floating, point, numbers, the, system, 360, model, 65, had, an, 8, bit, adder, for, decimal, and, fixed, point, binary, arithmetic, and, a, 60, bit, adder, for, floating, point, arithmetic, many, later, cpu, designs, use, similar, mixed, bit, width, especially, when, the, processor, is, meant, for, general, purpose, use, where, a, reasonable, balance, of, integer, and, floating, point, capability, is, required, the, description, of, the, basic, operation, of, a, cpu, offered, in, the, previous, section, describes, the, simplest, form, that, a, cpu, can, take, this, type, of, cpu, usually, referred, to, as, subscalar, operates, on, and, executes, one, instruction, on, one, or, two, pieces, of, data, at, a, time, that, is, less, than, one, instruction, per, clock, cycle, ipc, 1, this, process, gives, rise, to, an, inherent, inefficiency, in, subscalar, cpus, since, only, one, instruction, is, executed, at, a, time, the, entire, cpu, must, wait, for, that, instruction, to, complete, before, proceeding, to, the, next, instruction, as, a, result, the, subscalar, cpu, gets, hung, up, on, instructions, which, take, more, than, one, clock, cycle, to, complete, execution, even, adding, a, second, execution, unit, see, below, does, not, improve, performance, much, rather, than, one, pathway, being, hung, up, now, two, pathways, are, hung, up, and, the, number, of, unused, transistors, is, increased, this, design, wherein, the, cpu, s, execution, resources, can, operate, on, only, one, instruction, at, a, time, can, only, possibly, reach, scalar, performance, one, instruction, per, clock, cycle, ipc, 1, however, the, performance, is, nearly, always, subscalar, less, than, one, instruction, per, clock, cycle, ipc, 1, attempts, to, achieve, scalar, and, better, performance, have, resulted, in, a, variety, of, design, methodologies, that, cause, the, cpu, to, behave, less, linearly, and, more, in, parallel, when, referring, to, parallelism, in, cpus, two, terms, are, generally, used, to, classify, these, design, techniques, each, methodology, differs, both, in, the, ways, in, which, they, are, implemented, as, well, as, the, relative, effectiveness, they, afford, in, increasing, the, cpu, s, performance, for, an, application, one, of, the, simplest, methods, for, increased, parallelism, is, to, begin, the, first, steps, of, instruction, fetching, and, decoding, before, the, prior, instruction, finishes, executing, this, is, a, technique, known, as, instruction, pipelining, and, is, used, in, almost, all, modern, general, purpose, cpus, pipelining, allows, multiple, instruction, to, be, executed, at, a, time, by, breaking, the, execution, pathway, into, discrete, stages, this, separation, can, be, compared, to, an, assembly, line, in, which, an, instruction, is, made, more, complete, at, each, stage, until, it, exits, the, execution, pipeline, and, is, retired, pipelining, does, however, introduce, the, possibility, for, a, situation, where, the, result, of, the, previous, operation, is, needed, to, complete, the, next, operation, a, condition, often, termed, data, dependency, conflict, therefore, pipelined, processors, must, check, for, these, sorts, of, conditions, and, delay, a, portion, of, the, pipeline, if, necessary, a, pipelined, processor, can, become, very, nearly, scalar, inhibited, only, by, pipeline, stalls, an, instruction, spending, more, than, one, clock, cycle, in, a, stage, improvements, in, instruction, pipelining, led, to, further, decreases, in, the, idle, time, of, cpu, components, designs, that, are, said, to, be, superscalar, include, a, long, instruction, pipeline, and, multiple, identical, execution, units, such, as, load, store, units, arithmetic, logic, units, floating, point, units, and, address, generation, units, in, a, superscalar, pipeline, instructions, are, read, and, passed, to, a, dispatcher, which, decides, whether, or, not, the, instructions, can, be, executed, in, parallel, simultaneously, if, so, they, are, dispatched, to, execution, units, resulting, in, their, simultaneous, execution, in, general, the, number, of, instructions, that, a, superscalar, cpu, will, complete, in, a, cycle, is, dependent, on, the, number, of, instructions, it, is, able, to, dispatch, simultaneously, to, execution, units, most, of, the, difficulty, in, the, design, of, a, superscalar, cpu, architecture, lies, in, creating, an, effective, dispatcher, the, dispatcher, needs, to, be, able, to, quickly, determine, whether, instructions, can, be, executed, in, parallel, as, well, as, dispatch, them, in, such, a, way, as, to, keep, as, many, execution, units, busy, as, possible, this, requires, that, the, instruction, pipeline, is, filled, as, often, as, possible, and, requires, significant, amounts, of, cpu, cache, it, also, makes, hazard, avoiding, techniques, like, branch, prediction, speculative, execution, register, renaming, out, of, order, execution, and, transactional, memory, crucial, to, maintaining, high, levels, of, performance, by, attempting, to, predict, which, branch, or, path, a, conditional, instruction, will, take, the, cpu, can, minimize, the, number, of, times, that, the, entire, pipeline, must, wait, until, a, conditional, instruction, is, completed, speculative, execution, often, provides, modest, performance, increases, by, executing, portions, of, code, that, may, not, be, needed, after, a, conditional, operation, completes, out, of, order, execution, somewhat, rearranges, the, order, in, which, instructions, are, executed, to, reduce, delays, due, to, data, dependencies, also, in, case, of, single, instruction, stream, multiple, data, stream, a, case, when, a, lot, of, data, from, the, same, type, has, to, be, processed, modern, processors, can, disable, parts, of, the, pipeline, so, that, when, a, single, instruction, is, executed, many, times, the, cpu, skips, the, fetch, and, decode, phases, and, thus, greatly, increases, performance, on, certain, occasions, especially, in, highly, monotonous, program, engines, such, as, video, creation, software, and, photo, processing, when, a, fraction, of, the, cpu, is, superscalar, the, part, that, is, not, suffers, a, performance, penalty, due, to, scheduling, stalls, the, intel, p5, pentium, had, two, superscalar, alus, which, could, accept, one, instruction, per, clock, cycle, each, but, its, fpu, could, not, thus, the, p5, was, integer, superscalar, but, not, floating, point, superscalar, intel, s, successor, to, the, p5, architecture, p6, added, superscalar, abilities, to, its, floating, point, features, simple, pipelining, and, superscalar, design, increase, a, cpu, s, ilp, by, allowing, it, to, execute, instructions, at, rates, surpassing, one, instruction, per, clock, cycle, most, modern, cpu, designs, are, at, least, somewhat, superscalar, and, nearly, all, general, purpose, cpus, designed, in, the, last, decade, are, superscalar, in, later, years, some, of, the, emphasis, in, designing, high, ilp, computers, has, been, moved, out, of, the, cpu, s, hardware, and, into, its, software, interface, or, instruction, set, architecture, isa, the, strategy, of, the, very, long, instruction, word, vliw, causes, some, ilp, to, become, implied, directly, by, the, software, reducing, the, cpu, s, work, in, boosting, ilp, and, thereby, reducing, design, complexity, another, strategy, of, achieving, performance, is, to, execute, multiple, threads, or, processes, in, parallel, this, area, of, research, is, known, as, parallel, computing, in, flynn, s, taxonomy, this, strategy, is, known, as, multiple, instruction, stream, multiple, data, stream, mimd, one, technology, used, for, this, purpose, is, multiprocessing, mp, the, initial, type, of, this, technology, is, known, as, symmetric, multiprocessing, smp, where, a, small, number, of, cpus, share, a, coherent, view, of, their, memory, system, in, this, scheme, each, cpu, has, additional, hardware, to, maintain, a, constantly, up, to, date, view, of, memory, by, avoiding, stale, views, of, memory, the, cpus, can, cooperate, on, the, same, program, and, programs, can, migrate, from, one, cpu, to, another, to, increase, the, number, of, cooperating, cpus, beyond, a, handful, schemes, such, as, non, uniform, memory, access, numa, and, directory, based, coherence, protocols, were, introduced, in, the, 1990s, smp, systems, are, limited, to, a, small, number, of, cpus, while, numa, systems, have, been, built, with, thousands, of, processors, initially, multiprocessing, was, built, using, multiple, discrete, cpus, and, boards, to, implement, the, interconnect, between, the, processors, when, the, processors, and, their, interconnect, are, all, implemented, on, a, single, chip, the, technology, is, known, as, chip, level, multiprocessing, cmp, and, the, single, chip, as, a, multi, core, processor, it, was, later, recognized, that, finer, grain, parallelism, existed, with, a, single, program, a, single, program, might, have, several, threads, or, functions, that, could, be, executed, separately, or, in, parallel, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, this, technology, implemented, input, output, processing, such, as, direct, memory, access, as, a, separate, thread, from, the, computation, thread, a, more, general, approach, to, this, technology, was, introduced, in, the, 1970s, when, systems, were, designed, to, run, multiple, computation, threads, in, parallel, this, technology, is, known, as, multi, threading, mt, the, approach, is, considered, more, cost, effective, than, multiprocessing, as, only, a, small, number, of, components, within, a, cpu, are, replicated, to, support, mt, as, opposed, to, the, entire, cpu, in, the, case, of, mp, in, mt, the, execution, units, and, the, memory, system, including, the, caches, are, shared, among, multiple, threads, the, downside, of, mt, is, that, the, hardware, support, for, multithreading, is, more, visible, to, software, than, that, of, mp, and, thus, supervisor, software, like, operating, systems, have, to, undergo, larger, changes, to, support, mt, one, type, of, mt, that, was, implemented, is, known, as, temporal, multithreading, where, one, thread, is, executed, until, it, is, stalled, waiting, for, data, to, return, from, external, memory, in, this, scheme, the, cpu, would, then, quickly, context, switch, to, another, thread, which, is, ready, to, run, the, switch, often, done, in, one, cpu, clock, cycle, such, as, the, ultrasparc, t1, another, type, of, mt, is, simultaneous, multithreading, where, instructions, from, multiple, threads, are, executed, in, parallel, within, one, cpu, clock, cycle, for, several, decades, from, the, 1970s, to, early, 2000s, the, focus, in, designing, high, performance, general, purpose, cpus, was, largely, on, achieving, high, ilp, through, technologies, such, as, pipelining, caches, superscalar, execution, out, of, order, execution, etc, this, trend, culminated, in, large, power, hungry, cpus, such, as, the, intel, pentium, 4, by, the, early, 2000s, cpu, designers, were, thwarted, from, achieving, higher, performance, from, ilp, techniques, due, to, the, growing, disparity, between, cpu, operating, frequencies, and, main, memory, operating, frequencies, as, well, as, escalating, cpu, power, dissipation, owing, to, more, esoteric, ilp, techniques, cpu, designers, then, borrowed, ideas, from, commercial, computing, markets, such, as, transaction, processing, where, the, aggregate, performance, of, multiple, programs, also, known, as, throughput, computing, was, more, important, than, the, performance, of, a, single, thread, or, process, this, reversal, of, emphasis, is, evidenced, by, the, proliferation, of, dual, and, more, core, processor, designs, and, notably, intel, s, newer, designs, resembling, its, less, superscalar, p6, architecture, late, designs, in, several, processor, families, exhibit, cmp, including, the, x86, 64, opteron, and, athlon, 64, x2, the, sparc, ultrasparc, t1, ibm, power4, and, power5, as, well, as, several, video, game, console, cpus, like, the, xbox, 360, s, triple, core, powerpc, design, and, the, playstation, 3, s, 7, core, cell, microprocessor, a, less, common, but, increasingly, important, paradigm, of, processors, and, indeed, computing, in, general, deals, with, data, parallelism, the, processors, discussed, earlier, are, all, referred, to, as, some, type, of, scalar, device, as, the, name, implies, vector, processors, deal, with, multiple, pieces, of, data, in, the, context, of, one, instruction, this, contrasts, with, scalar, processors, which, deal, with, one, piece, of, data, for, every, instruction, using, flynn, s, taxonomy, these, two, schemes, of, dealing, with, data, are, generally, referred, to, as, single, instruction, stream, multiple, data, stream, simd, and, single, instruction, stream, single, data, stream, sisd, respectively, the, great, utility, in, creating, processors, that, deal, with, vectors, of, data, lies, in, optimizing, tasks, that, tend, to, require, the, same, operation, for, example, a, sum, or, a, dot, product, to, be, performed, on, a, large, set, of, data, some, classic, examples, of, these, types, of, tasks, include, multimedia, applications, images, video, and, sound, as, well, as, many, types, of, scientific, and, engineering, tasks, whereas, a, scalar, processor, must, complete, the, entire, process, of, fetching, decoding, and, executing, each, instruction, and, value, in, a, set, of, data, a, vector, processor, can, perform, a, single, operation, on, a, comparatively, large, set, of, data, with, one, instruction, this, is, only, possible, when, the, application, tends, to, require, many, steps, which, apply, one, operation, to, a, large, set, of, data, most, early, vector, processors, such, as, the, cray, 1, were, associated, almost, exclusively, with, scientific, research, and, cryptography, applications, however, as, multimedia, has, largely, shifted, to, digital, media, the, need, for, some, form, of, simd, in, general, purpose, processors, has, become, significant, shortly, after, inclusion, of, floating, point, units, started, to, become, commonplace, in, general, purpose, processors, specifications, for, and, implementations, of, simd, execution, units, also, began, to, appear, for, general, purpose, processors, some, of, these, early, simd, specifications, like, hp, s, multimedia, acceleration, extensions, max, and, intel, s, mmx, were, integer, only, this, proved, to, be, a, significant, impediment, for, some, software, developers, since, many, of, the, applications, that, benefit, from, simd, primarily, deal, with, floating, point, numbers, progressively, developers, refined, and, remade, these, early, designs, into, some, of, the, common, modern, simd, specifications, which, are, usually, associated, with, one, instruction, set, architecture, isa, some, notable, modern, examples, include, intel, s, streaming, simd, extensions, sse, and, the, powerpc, related, altivec, also, known, as, vmx, many, modern, architectures, including, embedded, ones, often, include, hardware, performance, counters, hpc, which, enables, low, level, instruction, level, collection, benchmarking, debugging, or, analysis, of, running, software, metrics, hpc, may, also, be, used, to, discover, and, analyze, unusual, or, suspicious, activity, of, the, software, such, as, return, oriented, programming, rop, or, sigreturn, oriented, programming, srop, exploits, etc, this, is, usually, done, by, software, security, teams, to, assess, and, find, malicious, binary, programs, many, major, vendors, such, as, ibm, intel, amd, and, arm, provide, software, interfaces, usually, written, in, c, c, that, can, be, used, to, collect, data, from, the, cpu, s, registers, in, order, to, get, metrics, operating, system, vendors, also, provide, software, like, perf, linux, to, record, benchmark, or, trace, cpu, events, running, kernels, and, applications, hardware, counters, provide, a, low, overhead, method, for, collecting, comprehensive, performance, metrics, related, to, a, cpu, s, core, elements, functional, units, caches, main, memory, etc, a, significant, advantage, over, software, profilers, additionally, they, generally, eliminate, the, need, to, modify, the, underlying, source, code, of, a, program, because, hardware, designs, differ, between, architectures, the, specific, types, and, interpretations, of, hardware, counters, will, also, change, most, modern, cpus, have, privileged, modes, to, support, operating, systems, and, virtualization, cloud, computing, can, use, virtualization, to, provide, virtual, central, processing, units, vcpu, s, for, separate, users, a, host, is, the, virtual, equivalent, of, a, physical, machine, on, which, a, virtual, system, is, operating, when, there, are, several, physical, machines, operating, in, tandem, and, managed, as, a, whole, the, grouped, computing, and, memory, resources, form, a, cluster, in, some, systems, it, is, possible, to, dynamically, add, and, remove, from, a, cluster, resources, available, at, a, host, and, cluster, level, can, be, partitioned, into, resources, pools, with, fine, granularity, the, performance, or, speed, of, a, processor, depends, on, among, many, other, factors, the, clock, rate, generally, given, in, multiples, of, hertz, and, the, instructions, per, clock, ipc, which, together, are, the, factors, for, the, instructions, per, second, ips, that, the, cpu, can, perform, many, reported, ips, values, have, represented, peak, execution, rates, on, artificial, instruction, sequences, with, few, branches, whereas, realistic, workloads, consist, of, a, mix, of, instructions, and, applications, some, of, which, take, longer, to, execute, than, others, the, performance, of, the, memory, hierarchy, also, greatly, affects, processor, performance, an, issue, barely, considered, in, ips, calculations, because, of, these, problems, various, standardized, tests, often, called, benchmarks, for, this, purpose, such, as, specint, have, been, developed, to, attempt, to, measure, the, real, effective, performance, in, commonly, used, applications, processing, performance, of, computers, is, increased, by, using, multi, core, processors, which, essentially, is, plugging, two, or, more, individual, processors, called, cores, in, this, sense, into, one, integrated, circuit, ideally, a, dual, core, processor, would, be, nearly, twice, as, powerful, as, a, single, core, processor, in, practice, the, performance, gain, is, far, smaller, only, about, 50, due, to, imperfect, software, algorithms, and, implementation, increasing, the, number, of, cores, in, a, processor, i, e, dual, core, quad, core, etc, increases, the, workload, that, can, be, handled, this, means, that, the, processor, can, now, handle, numerous, asynchronous, events, interrupts, etc, which, can, take, a, toll, on, the, cpu, when, overwhelmed, these, cores, can, be, thought, of, as, different, floors, in, a, processing, plant, with, each, floor, handling, a, different, task, sometimes, these, cores, will, handle, the, same, tasks, as, cores, adjacent, to, them, if, a, single, core, is, not, enough, to, handle, the, information, multi, core, cpus, enhance, a, computer, s, ability, to, run, several, tasks, simultaneously, by, providing, additional, processing, power, however, the, increase, in, speed, is, not, directly, proportional, to, the, number, of, cores, added, this, is, because, the, cores, need, to, interact, through, specific, channels, and, this, inter, core, communication, consumes, a, portion, of, the, available, processing, speed, due, to, specific, capabilities, of, modern, cpus, such, as, simultaneous, multithreading, and, uncore, which, involve, sharing, of, actual, cpu, resources, while, aiming, at, increased, utilization, monitoring, performance, levels, and, hardware, use, gradually, became, a, more, complex, task, as, a, response, some, cpus, implement, additional, hardware, logic, that, monitors, actual, use, of, various, parts, of, a, cpu, and, provides, various, counters, accessible, to, software, an, example, is, intel, s, performance, counter, monitor, technology
