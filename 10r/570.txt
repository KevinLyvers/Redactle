celestial, navigation, also, known, as, astronavigation, is, the, practice, of, position, fixing, using, stars, and, other, celestial, bodies, that, enables, a, navigator, to, accurately, determine, their, actual, current, physical, position, in, space, or, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, without, relying, solely, on, estimated, positional, calculations, commonly, known, as, dead, reckoning, celestial, navigation, is, performed, without, using, satellite, navigation, or, other, similar, modern, electronic, or, digital, positioning, means, celestial, navigation, uses, sights, or, timed, angular, measurements, taken, typically, between, a, celestial, body, e, g, the, sun, the, moon, a, planet, or, a, star, and, the, visible, horizon, celestial, navigation, can, also, take, advantage, of, measurements, between, celestial, bodies, without, reference, to, the, earth, s, horizon, such, as, when, the, moon, and, other, selected, bodies, are, used, in, the, practice, called, lunars, or, the, lunar, distance, method, used, for, determining, precise, time, when, time, is, unknown, celestial, navigation, by, taking, sights, of, the, sun, and, the, horizon, whilst, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, commonly, used, providing, various, methods, of, determining, position, one, of, which, is, the, popular, and, simple, method, called, noon, sight, navigation, being, a, single, observation, of, the, exact, altitude, of, the, sun, and, the, exact, time, of, that, altitude, known, as, local, noon, the, highest, point, of, the, sun, above, the, horizon, from, the, position, of, the, observer, in, any, single, day, this, angular, observation, combined, with, knowing, its, simultaneous, precise, time, referred, to, as, the, time, at, the, prime, meridian, directly, renders, a, latitude, and, longitude, fix, at, the, time, and, place, of, the, observation, by, simple, mathematical, reduction, the, moon, a, planet, polaris, or, one, of, the, 57, other, navigational, stars, whose, coordinates, are, tabulated, in, any, of, the, published, nautical, or, air, almanacs, can, also, accomplish, this, same, goal, celestial, navigation, accomplishes, its, purpose, by, using, angular, measurements, sights, between, celestial, bodies, and, the, visible, horizon, to, locate, one, s, position, on, the, earth, whether, on, land, in, the, air, or, at, sea, in, addition, observations, between, stars, and, other, celestial, bodies, accomplished, the, same, results, while, in, space, used, in, the, apollo, space, program, and, is, still, used, on, many, contemporary, satellites, equally, celestial, navigation, may, be, used, while, on, other, planetary, bodies, to, determine, position, on, their, surface, using, their, local, horizon, and, suitable, celestial, bodies, with, matching, reduction, tables, and, knowledge, of, local, time, for, navigation, by, celestial, means, when, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, at, any, given, instant, in, time, a, celestial, body, is, located, directly, over, a, single, point, on, the, earth, s, surface, the, latitude, and, longitude, of, that, point, are, known, as, the, celestial, body, s, geographic, position, gp, the, location, of, which, can, be, determined, from, tables, in, the, nautical, or, air, almanac, for, that, year, the, measured, angle, between, the, celestial, body, and, the, visible, horizon, is, directly, related, to, the, distance, between, the, celestial, body, s, gp, and, the, observer, s, position, after, some, computations, referred, to, as, sight, reduction, this, measurement, is, used, to, plot, a, line, of, position, lop, on, a, navigational, chart, or, plotting, worksheet, with, the, observer, s, position, being, somewhere, on, that, line, the, lop, is, actually, a, short, segment, of, a, very, large, circle, on, earth, that, surrounds, the, gp, of, the, observed, celestial, body, an, observer, located, anywhere, on, the, circumference, of, this, circle, on, earth, measuring, the, angle, of, the, same, celestial, body, above, the, horizon, at, that, instant, of, time, would, observe, that, body, to, be, at, the, same, angle, above, the, horizon, sights, on, two, celestial, bodies, give, two, such, lines, on, the, chart, intersecting, at, the, observer, s, position, actually, the, two, circles, would, result, in, two, points, of, intersection, arising, from, sights, on, two, stars, described, above, but, one, can, be, discarded, since, it, will, be, far, from, the, estimated, position, see, the, figure, at, the, example, below, most, navigators, will, use, sights, of, three, to, five, stars, if, available, since, that, will, result, in, only, one, common, intersection, and, minimize, the, chance, of, error, that, premise, is, the, basis, for, the, most, commonly, used, method, of, celestial, navigation, referred, to, as, the, altitude, intercept, method, at, least, three, points, must, be, plotted, the, plot, intersection, will, usually, provide, a, triangle, where, the, exact, position, is, inside, of, it, the, accuracy, of, the, sights, is, indicated, by, the, size, of, the, triangle, joshua, slocum, used, both, noon, sight, and, star, sight, navigation, to, determine, his, current, position, during, his, voyage, the, first, recorded, single, handed, circumnavigation, of, the, world, in, addition, he, used, the, lunar, distance, method, or, lunars, to, determine, and, maintain, known, time, at, greenwich, the, prime, meridian, thereby, keeping, his, tin, clock, reasonably, accurate, and, therefore, his, position, fixes, accurate, celestial, navigation, can, only, determine, longitude, when, the, time, at, the, prime, meridian, is, accurately, known, the, more, accurately, time, at, the, prime, meridian, 0, longitude, is, known, the, more, accurate, the, fix, indeed, every, four, seconds, of, time, source, commonly, a, chronometer, or, in, aircraft, an, accurate, hack, watch, error, can, lead, to, a, positional, error, of, one, nautical, mile, when, time, is, unknown, or, not, trusted, the, lunar, distance, method, can, be, used, as, a, method, of, determining, time, at, the, prime, meridian, a, functioning, timepiece, with, a, second, hand, or, digit, an, almanac, with, lunar, corrections, and, a, sextant, are, used, with, no, knowledge, of, time, at, all, a, lunar, calculation, given, an, observable, moon, of, respectable, altitude, can, provide, time, accurate, to, within, a, second, or, two, with, about, 15, to, 30, minutes, of, observations, and, mathematical, reduction, from, the, almanac, tables, after, practice, an, observer, can, regularly, derive, and, prove, time, using, this, method, to, within, about, one, second, or, one, nautical, mile, of, navigational, error, due, to, errors, ascribed, to, the, time, source, an, example, illustrating, the, concept, behind, the, intercept, method, for, determining, position, is, shown, to, the, right, two, other, common, methods, for, determining, one, s, position, using, celestial, navigation, are, longitude, by, chronometer, and, ex, meridian, methods, in, the, adjacent, image, the, two, circles, on, the, map, represent, lines, of, position, for, the, sun, and, moon, at, 12, 00, gmt, on, october, 29, 2005, at, this, time, a, navigator, on, a, ship, at, sea, measured, the, moon, to, be, 56, above, the, horizon, using, a, sextant, ten, minutes, later, the, sun, was, observed, to, be, 40, above, the, horizon, lines, of, position, were, then, calculated, and, plotted, for, each, of, these, observations, since, both, the, sun, and, moon, were, observed, at, their, respective, angles, from, the, same, location, the, navigator, would, have, to, be, located, at, one, of, the, two, locations, where, the, circles, cross, in, this, case, the, navigator, is, either, located, on, the, atlantic, ocean, about, 350, nautical, miles, 650, km, west, of, madeira, or, in, south, america, about, 90, nautical, miles, 170, km, southwest, of, asunci, n, paraguay, in, most, cases, determining, which, of, the, two, intersections, is, the, correct, one, is, obvious, to, the, observer, because, they, are, often, thousands, of, miles, apart, as, it, is, unlikely, that, the, ship, is, sailing, across, south, america, the, position, in, the, atlantic, is, the, correct, one, note, that, the, lines, of, position, in, the, figure, are, distorted, because, of, the, map, s, projection, they, would, be, circular, if, plotted, on, a, globe, an, observer, at, the, gran, chaco, point, would, see, the, moon, at, the, left, of, the, sun, and, an, observer, at, the, madeira, point, would, see, the, moon, at, the, right, of, the, sun, accurate, angle, measurement, has, evolved, over, the, years, one, simple, method, is, to, hold, the, hand, above, the, horizon, with, one, s, arm, stretched, out, the, angular, width, of, the, little, finger, is, just, over, 1, 5, degrees, at, extended, arm, s, length, and, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, elevation, of, the, sun, from, the, horizon, plane, and, therefore, estimate, the, time, until, sunset, the, need, for, more, accurate, measurements, led, to, the, development, of, a, number, of, increasingly, accurate, instruments, including, the, kamal, astrolabe, octant, and, sextant, the, sextant, and, octant, are, most, accurate, because, they, measure, angles, from, the, horizon, eliminating, errors, caused, by, the, placement, of, an, instrument, s, pointers, and, because, their, dual, mirror, system, cancels, relative, motions, of, the, instrument, showing, a, steady, view, of, the, object, and, horizon, navigators, measure, distance, on, the, earth, in, degrees, arcminutes, and, arcseconds, a, nautical, mile, is, defined, as, 1, 852, meters, but, is, also, not, accidentally, one, arc, minute, of, angle, along, a, meridian, on, the, earth, sextants, can, be, read, accurately, to, within, 0, 1, arcminutes, so, the, observer, s, position, can, be, determined, within, theoretically, 0, 1, nautical, miles, 185, 2, meters, or, about, 203, yards, most, ocean, navigators, measuring, from, a, moving, platform, under, fair, conditions, can, achieve, a, practical, accuracy, of, approximately, 1, 5, nautical, miles, 2, 8, km, enough, to, navigate, safely, when, out, of, sight, of, land, or, other, hazards, practical, celestial, navigation, usually, requires, a, marine, chronometer, to, measure, time, a, sextant, to, measure, the, angles, an, almanac, giving, schedules, of, the, coordinates, of, celestial, objects, a, set, of, sight, reduction, tables, to, help, perform, the, height, and, azimuth, computations, and, a, chart, of, the, region, with, sight, reduction, tables, the, only, calculations, required, are, addition, and, subtraction, small, handheld, computers, laptops, and, even, scientific, calculators, enable, modern, navigators, to, reduce, sextant, sights, in, minutes, by, automating, all, the, calculation, and, or, data, lookup, steps, most, people, can, master, simpler, celestial, navigation, procedures, after, a, day, or, two, of, instruction, and, practice, even, using, manual, calculation, methods, modern, practical, navigators, usually, use, celestial, navigation, in, combination, with, satellite, navigation, to, correct, a, dead, reckoning, track, that, is, a, course, estimated, from, a, vessel, s, position, course, and, speed, using, multiple, methods, helps, the, navigator, detect, errors, and, simplifies, procedures, when, used, this, way, a, navigator, from, time, to, time, measures, the, sun, s, altitude, with, a, sextant, then, compares, that, with, a, precalculated, altitude, based, on, the, exact, time, and, estimated, position, of, the, observation, on, the, chart, the, straight, edge, of, a, plotter, can, mark, each, position, line, if, the, position, line, indicates, a, location, more, than, a, few, miles, from, the, estimated, position, more, observations, can, be, taken, to, restart, the, dead, reckoning, track, in, the, event, of, equipment, or, electrical, failure, taking, sun, lines, a, few, times, a, day, and, advancing, them, by, dead, reckoning, allows, a, vessel, to, get, a, crude, running, fix, sufficient, to, return, to, port, one, can, also, use, the, moon, a, planet, polaris, or, one, of, 57, other, navigational, stars, to, track, celestial, positioning, latitude, was, measured, in, the, past, either, by, measuring, the, altitude, of, the, sun, at, noon, the, noon, sight, or, by, measuring, the, altitudes, of, any, other, celestial, body, when, crossing, the, meridian, reaching, its, maximum, altitude, when, due, north, or, south, and, frequently, by, measuring, the, altitude, of, polaris, the, north, star, assuming, it, is, sufficiently, visible, above, the, horizon, which, it, is, not, in, the, southern, hemisphere, polaris, always, stays, within, 1, degree, of, the, celestial, north, pole, if, a, navigator, measures, the, angle, to, polaris, and, finds, it, to, be, 10, degrees, from, the, horizon, then, he, is, about, 10, degrees, north, of, the, equator, this, approximate, latitude, is, then, corrected, using, simple, tables, or, almanac, corrections, to, determine, a, latitude, that, is, theoretically, accurate, to, within, a, fraction, of, a, mile, angles, are, measured, from, the, horizon, because, locating, the, point, directly, overhead, the, zenith, is, not, normally, possible, when, haze, obscures, the, horizon, navigators, use, artificial, horizons, which, are, horizontal, mirrors, or, pans, of, reflective, fluid, especially, mercury, in, the, latter, case, the, angle, between, the, reflected, image, in, the, mirror, and, the, actual, image, of, the, object, in, the, sky, is, exactly, twice, the, required, altitude, if, the, angle, to, polaris, can, be, accurately, measured, a, similar, measurement, of, a, star, near, the, eastern, or, western, horizons, would, provide, the, longitude, the, problem, is, that, the, earth, turns, 15, degrees, per, hour, making, such, measurements, dependent, on, time, a, measure, a, few, minutes, before, or, after, the, same, measure, the, day, before, creates, serious, navigation, errors, before, good, chronometers, were, available, longitude, measurements, were, based, on, the, transit, of, the, moon, or, the, positions, of, the, moons, of, jupiter, for, the, most, part, these, were, too, difficult, to, be, used, by, anyone, except, professional, astronomers, the, invention, of, the, modern, chronometer, by, john, harrison, in, 1761, vastly, simplified, longitudinal, calculation, the, longitude, problem, took, centuries, to, solve, and, was, dependent, on, the, construction, of, a, non, pendulum, clock, as, pendulum, clocks, cannot, function, accurately, on, a, tilting, ship, or, indeed, a, moving, vehicle, of, any, kind, two, useful, methods, evolved, during, the, 18th, century, and, are, still, practiced, today, lunar, distance, which, does, not, involve, the, use, of, a, chronometer, and, the, use, of, an, accurate, timepiece, or, chronometer, presently, layperson, calculations, of, longitude, can, be, made, by, noting, the, exact, local, time, leaving, out, any, reference, for, daylight, saving, time, when, the, sun, is, at, its, highest, point, in, earth, s, sky, the, calculation, of, noon, can, be, made, more, easily, and, accurately, with, a, small, exactly, vertical, rod, driven, into, level, ground, take, the, time, reading, when, the, shadow, is, pointing, due, north, in, the, northern, hemisphere, then, take, your, local, time, reading, and, subtract, it, from, gmt, greenwich, mean, time, or, the, time, in, london, england, for, example, a, noon, reading, 12, 00, near, central, canada, or, the, us, would, occur, at, approximately, 6, p, m, 18, 00, in, london, the, 6, hour, difference, is, one, quarter, of, a, 24, hour, day, or, 90, degrees, of, a, 360, degree, circle, the, earth, the, calculation, can, also, be, made, by, taking, the, number, of, hours, use, decimals, for, fractions, of, an, hour, multiplied, by, 15, the, number, of, degrees, in, one, hour, either, way, it, can, be, demonstrated, that, much, of, central, north, america, is, at, or, near, 90, degrees, west, longitude, eastern, longitudes, can, be, determined, by, adding, the, local, time, to, gmt, with, similar, calculations, an, older, but, still, useful, and, practical, method, of, determining, accurate, time, at, sea, before, the, advent, of, precise, timekeeping, and, satellite, based, time, systems, is, called, lunar, distances, or, lunars, which, was, used, extensively, for, a, short, period, and, refined, for, daily, use, on, board, ships, in, the, 18th, century, use, declined, through, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, as, better, and, better, timepieces, chronometers, became, available, to, the, average, vessel, at, sea, although, most, recently, only, used, by, sextant, hobbyists, and, historians, it, is, now, becoming, more, common, in, celestial, navigation, courses, to, reduce, total, dependence, on, gnss, systems, as, potentially, the, only, accurate, time, source, aboard, a, vessel, designed, for, use, when, an, accurate, timepiece, is, not, available, or, timepiece, accuracy, is, suspect, during, a, long, sea, voyage, the, navigator, precisely, measures, the, angle, between, the, moon, and, the, sun, or, between, the, moon, and, one, of, several, stars, near, the, ecliptic, the, observed, angle, must, be, corrected, for, the, effects, of, refraction, and, parallax, like, any, celestial, sight, to, make, this, correction, the, navigator, measures, the, altitudes, of, the, moon, and, sun, or, another, star, at, about, the, same, time, as, the, lunar, distance, angle, only, rough, values, for, the, altitudes, are, required, a, calculation, with, suitable, published, tables, or, longhand, with, logarithms, and, graphical, tables, requires, about, 10, to, 15, minutes, work, to, convert, the, observed, angle, s, to, a, geocentric, lunar, distance, the, navigator, then, compares, the, corrected, angle, against, those, listed, in, the, appropriate, almanac, pages, for, every, three, hours, of, greenwich, time, using, interpolation, tables, to, derive, intermediate, values, the, result, is, a, difference, in, time, between, the, time, source, of, unknown, time, used, for, the, observations, and, the, actual, prime, meridian, time, that, of, the, zero, meridian, at, greenwich, also, known, as, utc, or, gmt, knowing, utc, gmt, a, further, set, of, sights, can, be, taken, and, reduced, by, the, navigator, to, calculate, their, exact, position, on, the, earth, as, a, local, latitude, and, longitude, the, considerably, more, popular, method, was, and, still, is, to, use, an, accurate, timepiece, to, directly, measure, the, time, of, a, sextant, sight, the, need, for, accurate, navigation, led, to, the, development, of, progressively, more, accurate, chronometers, in, the, 18th, century, see, john, harrison, today, time, is, measured, with, a, chronometer, a, quartz, watch, a, shortwave, radio, time, signal, broadcast, from, an, atomic, clock, or, the, time, displayed, on, a, satellite, time, signal, receiver, a, quartz, wristwatch, normally, keeps, time, within, a, half, second, per, day, if, it, is, worn, constantly, keeping, it, near, body, heat, its, rate, of, drift, can, be, measured, with, the, radio, and, by, compensating, for, this, drift, a, navigator, can, keep, time, to, better, than, a, second, per, month, when, time, at, the, prime, meridian, or, another, starting, point, is, accurately, known, celestial, navigation, can, determine, longitude, and, the, more, accurately, latitude, and, time, are, known, the, more, accurate, the, longitude, determination, the, angular, speed, of, the, earth, is, latitude, dependent, at, the, poles, or, latitude, 90, the, rotation, velocity, of, the, earth, reaches, zero, at, 45, latitude, one, second, of, time, is, equivalent, in, longitude, to, 1, 077, 8, ft, 328, 51, m, or, one, tenth, of, a, second, means, 107, 8, ft, 32, 86, m, at, the, slightly, bulged, out, equator, or, latitude, 0, the, rotation, velocity, of, earth, or, its, equivalent, in, longitude, reaches, its, maximum, at, 465, 10, m, s, 1, 525, 9, ft, s, traditionally, a, navigator, checked, their, chronometer, s, with, their, sextant, at, a, geographic, marker, surveyed, by, a, professional, astronomer, this, is, now, a, rare, skill, and, most, harbormasters, cannot, locate, their, harbor, s, marker, ships, often, carried, more, than, one, chronometer, chronometers, were, kept, on, gimbals, in, a, dry, room, near, the, center, of, the, ship, they, were, used, to, set, a, hack, watch, for, the, actual, sight, so, that, no, chronometers, were, ever, exposed, to, the, wind, and, salt, water, on, deck, winding, and, comparing, the, chronometers, was, a, crucial, duty, of, the, navigator, even, today, it, is, still, logged, daily, in, the, ship, s, deck, log, and, reported, to, the, captain, before, eight, bells, on, the, forenoon, watch, shipboard, noon, navigators, also, set, the, ship, s, clocks, and, calendar, two, chronometers, provided, dual, modular, redundancy, allowing, a, backup, if, one, ceases, to, work, but, not, allowing, any, error, correction, if, the, two, displayed, a, different, time, since, in, case, of, contradiction, between, the, two, chronometers, it, would, be, impossible, to, know, which, one, was, wrong, the, error, detection, obtained, would, be, the, same, as, having, only, one, chronometer, and, checking, it, periodically, every, day, at, noon, against, dead, reckoning, three, chronometers, provided, triple, modular, redundancy, allowing, error, correction, if, one, of, the, three, was, wrong, so, the, pilot, would, take, the, average, of, the, two, with, closer, readings, average, precision, vote, there, is, an, old, adage, to, this, effect, stating, never, go, to, sea, with, two, chronometers, take, one, or, three, vessels, engaged, in, survey, work, generally, carried, many, more, than, three, chronometers, for, example, hms, beagle, carried, 22, chronometers, the, celestial, line, of, position, concept, was, discovered, in, 1837, by, thomas, hubbard, sumner, when, after, one, observation, he, computed, and, plotted, his, longitude, at, more, than, one, trial, latitude, in, his, vicinity, and, noticed, that, the, positions, lay, along, a, line, using, this, method, with, two, bodies, navigators, were, finally, able, to, cross, two, position, lines, and, obtain, their, position, in, effect, determining, both, latitude, and, longitude, later, in, the, 19th, century, came, the, development, of, the, modern, marcq, st, hilaire, intercept, method, with, this, method, the, body, height, and, azimuth, are, calculated, for, a, convenient, trial, position, and, compared, with, the, observed, height, the, difference, in, arcminutes, is, the, nautical, mile, intercept, distance, that, the, position, line, needs, to, be, shifted, toward, or, away, from, the, direction, of, the, body, s, subpoint, the, intercept, method, uses, the, concept, illustrated, in, the, example, in, the, how, it, works, section, above, two, other, methods, of, reducing, sights, are, the, longitude, by, chronometer, and, the, ex, meridian, method, while, celestial, navigation, is, becoming, increasingly, redundant, with, the, advent, of, inexpensive, and, highly, accurate, satellite, navigation, receivers, gnss, it, was, used, extensively, in, aviation, until, the, 1960s, and, marine, navigation, until, quite, recently, however, since, a, prudent, mariner, never, relies, on, any, sole, means, of, fixing, their, position, many, national, maritime, authorities, still, require, deck, officers, to, show, knowledge, of, celestial, navigation, in, examinations, primarily, as, a, backup, for, electronic, or, satellite, navigation, one, of, the, most, common, current, uses, of, celestial, navigation, aboard, large, merchant, vessels, is, for, compass, calibration, and, error, checking, at, sea, when, no, terrestrial, references, are, available, in, 1980, french, navy, regulations, still, required, an, independently, operated, timepiece, on, board, so, that, in, combination, with, a, sextant, a, ship, s, position, could, be, determined, by, celestial, navigation, the, u, s, air, force, and, u, s, navy, continued, instructing, military, aviators, on, celestial, navigation, use, until, 1997, because, the, united, states, naval, academy, usna, announced, that, it, was, discontinuing, its, course, on, celestial, navigation, considered, to, be, one, of, its, most, demanding, non, engineering, courses, from, the, formal, curriculum, in, the, spring, of, 1998, in, october, 2015, citing, concerns, about, the, reliability, of, gnss, systems, in, the, face, of, potential, hostile, hacking, the, usna, reinstated, instruction, in, celestial, navigation, in, the, 2015, to, 2016, academic, year, at, another, federal, service, academy, the, us, merchant, marine, academy, there, was, no, break, in, instruction, in, celestial, navigation, as, it, is, required, to, pass, the, us, coast, guard, license, exam, to, enter, the, merchant, marine, it, is, also, taught, at, harvard, most, recently, as, astronomy, 2, celestial, navigation, continues, to, be, used, by, private, yachtsmen, and, particularly, by, long, distance, cruising, yachts, around, the, world, for, small, cruising, boat, crews, celestial, navigation, is, generally, considered, an, essential, skill, when, venturing, beyond, visual, range, of, land, although, satellite, navigation, technology, is, reliable, offshore, yachtsmen, use, celestial, navigation, as, either, a, primary, navigational, tool, or, as, a, backup, celestial, navigation, was, used, in, commercial, aviation, up, until, the, early, part, of, the, jet, age, early, boeing, 747s, had, a, sextant, port, in, the, roof, of, the, cockpit, it, was, only, phased, out, in, the, 1960s, with, the, advent, of, inertial, navigation, and, doppler, navigation, systems, and, today, s, satellite, based, systems, which, can, locate, the, aircraft, s, position, accurate, to, a, 3, meter, sphere, with, several, updates, per, second, a, variation, on, terrestrial, celestial, navigation, was, used, to, help, orient, the, apollo, spacecraft, en, route, to, and, from, the, moon, to, this, day, space, missions, such, as, the, mars, exploration, rover, use, star, trackers, to, determine, the, attitude, of, the, spacecraft, as, early, as, the, mid, 1960s, advanced, electronic, and, computer, systems, had, evolved, enabling, navigators, to, obtain, automated, celestial, sight, fixes, these, systems, were, used, aboard, both, ships, and, us, air, force, aircraft, and, were, highly, accurate, able, to, lock, onto, up, to, 11, stars, even, in, daytime, and, resolve, the, craft, s, position, to, less, than, 300, feet, 91, m, the, sr, 71, high, speed, reconnaissance, aircraft, was, one, example, of, an, aircraft, that, used, a, combination, of, automated, celestial, and, inertial, navigation, these, rare, systems, were, expensive, however, and, the, few, that, remain, in, use, today, are, regarded, as, backups, to, more, reliable, satellite, positioning, systems, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, use, celestial, navigation, to, check, and, correct, their, course, initially, set, using, internal, gyroscopes, while, flying, outside, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, immunity, to, jamming, signals, is, the, main, driver, behind, this, seemingly, archaic, technique, x, ray, pulsar, based, navigation, and, timing, xnav, is, an, experimental, navigation, technique, for, space, whereby, the, periodic, x, ray, signals, emitted, from, pulsars, are, used, to, determine, the, location, of, a, vehicle, such, as, a, spacecraft, in, deep, space, a, vehicle, using, xnav, would, compare, received, x, ray, signals, with, a, database, of, known, pulsar, frequencies, and, locations, similar, to, gnss, this, comparison, would, allow, the, vehicle, to, triangulate, its, position, accurately, 5, km, the, advantage, of, using, x, ray, signals, over, radio, waves, is, that, x, ray, telescopes, can, be, made, smaller, and, lighter, on, 9, november, 2016, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, launched, an, experimental, pulsar, navigation, satellite, called, xpnav, 1, sextant, station, explorer, for, x, ray, timing, and, navigation, technology, is, a, nasa, funded, project, developed, at, the, goddard, space, flight, center, that, is, testing, xnav, on, orbit, on, board, the, international, space, station, in, connection, with, the, nicer, project, launched, on, 3, june, 2017, on, the, spacex, crs, 11, iss, resupply, mission, celestial, navigation, training, equipment, for, aircraft, crews, combine, a, simple, flight, simulator, with, a, planetarium, an, early, example, is, the, link, celestial, navigation, trainer, used, in, the, second, world, war, housed, in, a, 45, foot, 14, m, high, building, it, featured, a, cockpit, accommodating, a, whole, bomber, crew, pilot, navigator, and, bombardier, the, cockpit, offered, a, full, array, of, instruments, which, the, pilot, used, to, fly, the, simulated, airplane, fixed, to, a, dome, above, the, cockpit, was, an, arrangement, of, lights, some, collimated, simulating, constellations, from, which, the, navigator, determined, the, plane, s, position, the, dome, s, movement, simulated, the, changing, positions, of, the, stars, with, the, passage, of, time, and, the, movement, of, the, plane, around, the, earth, the, navigator, also, received, simulated, radio, signals, from, various, positions, on, the, ground, below, the, cockpit, moved, terrain, plates, large, movable, aerial, photographs, of, the, land, below, which, gave, the, crew, the, impression, of, flight, and, enabled, the, bomber, to, practice, lining, up, bombing, targets, a, team, of, operators, sat, at, a, control, booth, on, the, ground, below, the, machine, from, which, they, could, simulate, weather, conditions, such, as, wind, or, clouds, this, team, also, tracked, the, airplane, s, position, by, moving, a, crab, a, marker, on, a, paper, map, the, link, celestial, navigation, trainer, was, developed, in, response, to, a, request, made, by, the, royal, air, force, raf, in, 1939, the, raf, ordered, 60, of, these, machines, and, the, first, one, was, built, in, 1941, the, raf, used, only, a, few, of, these, leasing, the, rest, back, to, the, us, where, eventually, hundreds, were, in, use, media, related, to, celestial, navigation, at, wikimedia, commons
