amateur, radio, also, known, as, ham, radio, is, the, use, of, the, radio, frequency, spectrum, for, purposes, of, non, commercial, exchange, of, messages, wireless, experimentation, self, training, private, recreation, radiosport, contesting, and, emergency, communications, the, term, amateur, is, used, to, specify, a, duly, authorized, person, interested, in, radioelectric, practice, with, a, purely, personal, aim, and, without, pecuniary, interest, either, direct, monetary, or, other, similar, reward, and, to, differentiate, it, from, commercial, broadcasting, public, safety, such, as, police, and, fire, or, professional, two, way, radio, services, such, as, maritime, aviation, taxis, etc, the, amateur, radio, service, amateur, service, and, amateur, satellite, service, is, established, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, through, the, radio, regulations, national, governments, regulate, technical, and, operational, characteristics, of, transmissions, and, issue, individual, station, licenses, with, a, unique, identifying, call, sign, which, must, be, used, in, all, transmissions, amateur, operators, must, hold, an, amateur, radio, license, which, is, obtained, by, passing, a, government, test, demonstrating, adequate, technical, radio, knowledge, and, legal, knowledge, of, the, host, government, s, radio, regulations, radio, amateurs, are, limited, to, a, specific, set, of, frequency, bands, the, amateur, radio, bands, allocated, throughout, the, radio, spectrum, but, within, these, bands, are, allowed, to, transmit, on, any, frequency, using, a, variety, of, voice, text, image, and, data, communications, modes, this, enables, communication, across, a, city, region, country, continent, the, world, or, even, into, space, in, many, countries, amateur, radio, operators, may, also, send, receive, or, relay, radio, communications, between, computers, or, transceivers, connected, to, secure, virtual, private, networks, on, the, internet, amateur, radio, is, officially, represented, and, coordinated, by, the, international, amateur, radio, union, iaru, which, is, organized, in, three, regions, and, has, as, its, members, the, national, amateur, radio, societies, which, exist, in, most, countries, according, to, an, estimate, made, in, 2011, by, the, american, radio, relay, league, two, million, people, throughout, the, world, are, regularly, involved, with, amateur, radio, about, 830, 000, amateur, radio, stations, are, located, in, iaru, region, 2, the, americas, followed, by, iaru, region, 3, south, and, east, asia, and, the, pacific, ocean, with, about, 750, 000, stations, a, significantly, smaller, number, about, 400, 000, are, located, in, iaru, region, 1, europe, middle, east, cis, africa, the, origins, of, amateur, radio, can, be, traced, to, the, late, 19th, century, but, amateur, radio, as, practised, today, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, first, annual, official, wireless, blue, book, of, the, wireless, association, of, america, produced, in, 1909, contains, a, list, of, amateur, radio, stations, this, radio, callbook, lists, wireless, telegraph, stations, in, canada, and, the, united, states, including, 89, amateur, radio, stations, as, with, radio, in, general, amateur, radio, was, associated, with, various, amateur, experimenters, and, hobbyists, amateur, radio, enthusiasts, have, significantly, contributed, to, science, engineering, industry, and, social, services, research, by, amateur, operators, has, founded, new, industries, built, economies, empowered, nations, and, saved, lives, in, times, of, emergency, ham, radio, can, also, be, used, in, the, classroom, to, teach, english, map, skills, geography, math, science, and, computer, skills, the, term, ham, was, first, a, pejorative, term, used, in, professional, wired, telegraphy, during, the, 19th, century, to, mock, operators, with, poor, morse, code, sending, skills, ham, fisted, this, term, continued, to, be, used, after, the, invention, of, radio, and, the, proliferation, of, amateur, experimentation, with, wireless, telegraphy, among, land, and, sea, based, professional, radio, operators, ham, amateurs, were, considered, a, nuisance, the, use, of, ham, meaning, amateurish, or, unskilled, survives, today, sparsely, in, other, disciplines, e, g, ham, actor, the, amateur, radio, community, subsequently, began, to, reclaim, the, word, as, a, label, of, pride, and, by, the, mid, 20th, century, it, had, lost, its, pejorative, meaning, although, not, an, acronym, it, is, often, written, as, ham, in, capital, letters, the, many, facets, of, amateur, radio, attract, practitioners, with, a, wide, range, of, interests, many, amateurs, begin, with, a, fascination, with, radio, communication, and, then, combine, other, personal, interests, to, make, pursuit, of, the, hobby, rewarding, some, of, the, focal, areas, amateurs, pursue, include, radio, contesting, radio, propagation, study, public, service, communication, technical, experimentation, and, computer, networking, hobbyist, radio, enthusiasts, employ, a, variety, of, transmission, methods, for, interaction, the, primary, modes, for, vocal, communications, are, frequency, modulation, fm, and, single, sideband, ssb, fm, is, recognized, for, its, superior, audio, quality, whereas, ssb, is, more, efficient, for, long, range, communication, under, limited, bandwidth, conditions, radiotelegraphy, using, morse, code, also, known, as, cw, from, continuous, wave, is, the, wireless, extension, of, landline, wired, telegraphy, developed, by, samuel, morse, and, dates, to, the, earliest, days, of, radio, although, computer, based, digital, modes, and, methods, have, largely, replaced, cw, for, commercial, and, military, applications, many, amateur, radio, operators, still, enjoy, using, the, cw, mode, particularly, on, the, shortwave, bands, and, for, experimental, work, such, as, earth, moon, earth, communication, because, of, its, inherent, signal, to, noise, ratio, advantages, morse, using, internationally, agreed, message, encodings, such, as, the, q, code, enables, communication, between, amateurs, who, speak, different, languages, it, is, also, popular, with, homebrewers, and, in, particular, with, qrp, or, very, low, power, enthusiasts, as, cw, only, transmitters, are, simpler, to, construct, and, the, human, ear, brain, signal, processing, system, can, pull, weak, cw, signals, out, of, the, noise, where, voice, signals, would, be, totally, inaudible, a, similar, legacy, mode, popular, with, home, constructors, is, amplitude, modulation, am, pursued, by, many, vintage, amateur, radio, enthusiasts, and, aficionados, of, vacuum, tube, technology, demonstrating, a, proficiency, in, morse, code, was, for, many, years, a, requirement, to, obtain, an, amateur, license, to, transmit, on, frequencies, below, 30, mhz, following, changes, in, international, regulations, in, 2003, countries, are, no, longer, required, to, demand, proficiency, the, united, states, federal, communications, commission, for, example, phased, out, this, requirement, for, all, license, classes, on, 23, february, 2007, modern, personal, computers, have, encouraged, the, use, of, digital, modes, such, as, radioteletype, rtty, which, previously, required, cumbersome, mechanical, equipment, hams, led, the, development, of, packet, radio, in, the, 1970s, which, has, employed, protocols, such, as, ax, 25, and, tcp, ip, specialized, digital, modes, such, as, psk31, allow, real, time, low, power, communications, on, the, shortwave, bands, but, has, been, losing, favor, in, place, of, newer, digital, modes, such, as, ft8, radio, over, ip, or, roip, is, similar, to, voice, over, ip, voip, but, augments, two, way, radio, communications, rather, than, telephone, calls, echolink, using, voip, technology, has, enabled, amateurs, to, communicate, through, local, internet, connected, repeaters, and, radio, nodes, while, irlp, has, allowed, the, linking, of, repeaters, to, provide, greater, coverage, area, automatic, link, establishment, ale, has, enabled, continuous, amateur, radio, networks, to, operate, on, the, high, frequency, bands, with, global, coverage, other, modes, such, as, fsk441, using, software, such, as, wsjt, are, used, for, weak, signal, modes, including, meteor, scatter, and, moonbounce, communications, fast, scan, amateur, television, has, gained, popularity, as, hobbyists, adapt, inexpensive, consumer, video, electronics, like, camcorders, and, video, cards, in, pcs, because, of, the, wide, bandwidth, and, stable, signals, required, amateur, television, is, typically, found, in, the, 70, cm, 420, 450, mhz, wavelength, range, though, there, is, also, limited, use, on, 33, cm, 902, 928, mhz, 23, cm, 1240, 1300, mhz, and, shorter, these, requirements, also, effectively, limit, the, signal, range, to, between, 20, and, 60, miles, 30, 100, km, linked, repeater, systems, however, can, allow, transmissions, of, vhf, and, higher, frequencies, across, hundreds, of, miles, repeaters, are, usually, located, on, heights, of, land, or, on, tall, structures, and, allow, operators, to, communicate, over, hundreds, of, miles, using, hand, held, or, mobile, transceivers, repeaters, can, also, be, linked, together, by, using, other, amateur, radio, bands, landline, or, the, internet, amateur, radio, satellites, can, be, accessed, some, using, a, hand, held, transceiver, ht, even, at, times, using, the, factory, rubber, duck, antenna, hams, also, use, the, moon, the, aurora, borealis, and, the, ionized, trails, of, meteors, as, reflectors, of, radio, waves, hams, can, also, contact, the, international, space, station, iss, because, many, astronauts, are, licensed, as, amateur, radio, operators, amateur, radio, operators, use, their, amateur, radio, station, to, make, contacts, with, individual, hams, as, well, as, participating, in, round, table, discussion, groups, or, rag, chew, sessions, on, the, air, some, join, in, regularly, scheduled, on, air, meetings, with, other, amateur, radio, operators, called, nets, as, in, networks, which, are, moderated, by, a, station, referred, to, as, net, control, nets, can, allow, operators, to, learn, procedures, for, emergencies, be, an, informal, round, table, or, cover, specific, interests, shared, by, a, group, amateur, radio, operators, using, battery, or, generator, powered, equipment, often, provide, essential, communications, services, when, regular, channels, are, unavailable, due, to, natural, disaster, or, other, disruptive, events, many, amateur, radio, operators, participate, in, radio, contests, during, which, an, individual, or, team, of, operators, typically, seek, to, contact, and, exchange, information, with, as, many, other, amateur, radio, stations, as, possible, in, a, given, period, of, time, in, addition, to, contests, a, number, of, amateur, radio, operating, award, schemes, exist, sometimes, suffixed, with, on, the, air, such, as, summits, on, the, air, islands, on, the, air, worked, all, states, and, jamboree, on, the, air, amateur, radio, operators, may, also, act, as, citizen, scientists, for, propagation, research, and, atmospheric, science, radio, transmission, permits, are, closely, controlled, by, nations, governments, because, radio, waves, propagate, beyond, national, boundaries, and, therefore, radio, is, of, international, concern, both, the, requirements, for, and, privileges, granted, to, a, licensee, vary, from, country, to, country, but, generally, follow, the, international, regulations, and, standards, established, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, and, world, radio, conferences, all, countries, that, license, citizens, to, use, amateur, radio, require, operators, to, display, knowledge, and, understanding, of, key, concepts, usually, by, passing, an, exam, the, licenses, grant, hams, the, privilege, to, operate, in, larger, segments, of, the, radio, frequency, spectrum, with, a, wider, variety, of, communication, techniques, and, with, higher, power, levels, relative, to, unlicensed, personal, radio, services, such, as, cb, radio, frs, and, pmr446, which, require, type, approved, equipment, restricted, in, mode, range, and, power, amateur, licensing, is, a, routine, civil, administrative, matter, in, many, countries, amateurs, therein, must, pass, an, examination, to, demonstrate, technical, knowledge, operating, competence, and, awareness, of, legal, and, regulatory, requirements, in, order, to, avoid, interfering, with, other, amateurs, and, other, radio, services, a, series, of, exams, are, often, available, each, progressively, more, challenging, and, granting, more, privileges, greater, frequency, availability, higher, power, output, permitted, experimentation, and, in, some, countries, distinctive, call, signs, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, and, australia, have, begun, requiring, a, practical, assessment, in, addition, to, the, written, exams, in, order, to, obtain, a, beginner, s, license, which, they, call, a, foundation, license, in, most, countries, an, operator, will, be, assigned, a, call, sign, with, their, license, in, some, countries, a, separate, station, license, is, required, for, any, station, used, by, an, amateur, radio, operator, amateur, radio, licenses, may, also, be, granted, to, organizations, or, clubs, in, some, countries, hams, were, allowed, to, operate, only, club, stations, an, amateur, radio, license, is, valid, only, in, the, country, in, which, it, is, issued, or, in, another, country, that, has, a, reciprocal, licensing, agreement, with, the, issuing, country, in, some, countries, an, amateur, radio, license, is, necessary, in, order, to, purchase, or, possess, amateur, radio, equipment, amateur, radio, licensing, in, the, united, states, exemplifies, the, way, in, which, some, countries, award, different, levels, of, amateur, radio, licenses, based, on, technical, knowledge, three, sequential, levels, of, licensing, exams, technician, class, general, class, and, amateur, extra, class, are, currently, offered, which, allow, operators, who, pass, them, access, to, larger, portions, of, the, amateur, radio, spectrum, and, more, desirable, shorter, call, signs, an, exam, authorized, by, the, federal, communications, commission, fcc, is, required, for, all, levels, of, the, amateur, radio, license, these, exams, are, administered, by, volunteer, examiners, accredited, by, the, fcc, recognized, volunteer, examiner, coordinator, vec, system, the, technician, class, and, general, class, exams, consist, of, 35, multiple, choice, questions, drawn, randomly, from, a, pool, of, at, least, 350, to, pass, 26, of, the, 35, questions, must, be, answered, correctly, the, extra, class, exam, has, 50, multiple, choice, questions, drawn, randomly, from, a, pool, of, at, least, 500, 37, of, which, must, be, answered, correctly, the, tests, cover, regulations, customs, and, technical, knowledge, such, as, fcc, provisions, operating, practices, advanced, electronics, theory, radio, equipment, design, and, safety, morse, code, is, no, longer, tested, in, the, u, s, once, the, exam, is, passed, the, fcc, issues, an, amateur, radio, license, which, is, valid, for, ten, years, studying, for, the, exam, is, made, easier, because, the, entire, question, pools, for, all, license, classes, are, posted, in, advance, the, question, pools, are, updated, every, four, years, by, the, national, conference, of, vecs, prospective, amateur, radio, operators, are, examined, on, understanding, of, the, key, concepts, of, electronics, radio, equipment, antennas, radio, propagation, rf, safety, and, the, radio, regulations, of, the, government, granting, the, license, these, examinations, are, sets, of, questions, typically, posed, in, either, a, short, answer, or, multiple, choice, format, examinations, can, be, administered, by, bureaucrats, non, paid, certified, examiners, or, previously, licensed, amateur, radio, operators, the, ease, with, which, an, individual, can, acquire, an, amateur, radio, license, varies, from, country, to, country, in, some, countries, examinations, may, be, offered, only, once, or, twice, a, year, in, the, national, capital, and, can, be, inordinately, bureaucratic, for, example, in, india, or, challenging, because, some, amateurs, must, undergo, difficult, security, approval, as, in, iran, currently, only, yemen, and, north, korea, do, not, issue, amateur, radio, licenses, to, their, citizens, some, developing, countries, especially, those, in, africa, asia, and, latin, america, require, the, payment, of, annual, license, fees, that, can, be, prohibitively, expensive, for, most, of, their, citizens, a, few, small, countries, may, not, have, a, national, licensing, process, and, may, instead, require, prospective, amateur, radio, operators, to, take, the, licensing, examinations, of, a, foreign, country, in, countries, with, the, largest, numbers, of, amateur, radio, licensees, such, as, japan, the, united, states, thailand, canada, and, most, of, the, countries, in, europe, there, are, frequent, license, examinations, opportunities, in, major, cities, granting, a, separate, license, to, a, club, or, organization, generally, requires, that, an, individual, with, a, current, and, valid, amateur, radio, license, who, is, in, good, standing, with, the, telecommunications, authority, assumes, responsibility, for, any, operations, conducted, under, the, club, license, or, club, call, sign, a, few, countries, may, issue, special, licenses, to, novices, or, beginners, that, do, not, assign, the, individual, a, call, sign, but, instead, require, the, newly, licensed, individual, to, operate, from, stations, licensed, to, a, club, or, organization, for, a, period, of, time, before, a, higher, class, of, license, can, be, acquired, a, reciprocal, licensing, agreement, between, two, countries, allows, bearers, of, an, amateur, radio, license, in, one, country, under, certain, conditions, to, legally, operate, an, amateur, radio, station, in, the, other, country, without, having, to, obtain, an, amateur, radio, license, from, the, country, being, visited, or, the, bearer, of, a, valid, license, in, one, country, can, receive, a, separate, license, and, a, call, sign, in, another, country, both, of, which, have, a, mutually, agreed, reciprocal, licensing, approvals, reciprocal, licensing, requirements, vary, from, country, to, country, some, countries, have, bilateral, or, multilateral, reciprocal, operating, agreements, allowing, hams, to, operate, within, their, borders, with, a, single, set, of, requirements, some, countries, lack, reciprocal, licensing, systems, others, use, international, bodies, such, as, the, organization, of, american, states, to, facilitate, licensing, reciprocity, when, traveling, abroad, visiting, amateur, operators, must, follow, the, rules, of, the, country, in, which, they, wish, to, operate, some, countries, have, reciprocal, international, operating, agreements, allowing, hams, from, other, countries, to, operate, within, their, borders, with, just, their, home, country, license, other, host, countries, require, that, the, visiting, ham, apply, for, a, formal, permit, or, even, a, new, host, country, issued, license, in, advance, the, reciprocal, recognition, of, licenses, frequently, not, only, depends, on, the, involved, licensing, authorities, but, also, on, the, nationality, of, the, bearer, as, an, example, in, the, us, foreign, licenses, are, recognized, only, if, the, bearer, does, not, have, us, citizenship, and, holds, no, us, license, which, may, differ, in, terms, of, operating, privileges, and, restrictions, conversely, a, us, citizen, may, operate, under, reciprocal, agreements, in, canada, but, not, a, non, us, citizen, holding, a, us, license, many, people, start, their, involvement, in, amateur, radio, on, social, media, or, by, finding, a, local, club, clubs, often, provide, information, about, licensing, local, operating, practices, and, technical, advice, newcomers, also, often, study, independently, by, purchasing, books, or, other, materials, sometimes, with, the, help, of, a, mentor, teacher, or, friend, in, north, america, established, amateurs, who, help, newcomers, are, often, referred, to, as, elmers, as, coined, by, rodney, newkirk, w9brd, within, the, ham, community, in, addition, many, countries, have, national, amateur, radio, societies, which, encourage, newcomers, and, work, with, government, communications, regulation, authorities, for, the, benefit, of, all, radio, amateurs, the, oldest, of, these, societies, is, the, wireless, institute, of, australia, formed, in, 1910, other, notable, societies, are, the, radio, society, of, great, britain, the, american, radio, relay, league, radio, amateurs, of, canada, bangladesh, ngos, network, for, radio, and, communication, the, new, zealand, association, of, radio, transmitters, and, south, african, radio, league, see, category, amateur, radio, organizations, an, amateur, radio, operator, uses, a, call, sign, on, the, air, to, legally, identify, the, operator, or, station, in, some, countries, the, call, sign, assigned, to, the, station, must, always, be, used, whereas, in, other, countries, the, call, sign, of, either, the, operator, or, the, station, may, be, used, in, certain, jurisdictions, an, operator, may, also, select, a, vanity, call, sign, although, these, must, also, conform, to, the, issuing, government, s, allocation, and, structure, used, for, amateur, radio, call, signs, some, jurisdictions, require, a, fee, to, obtain, such, a, vanity, call, sign, in, others, such, as, the, uk, a, fee, is, not, required, and, the, vanity, call, sign, may, be, selected, when, the, license, is, applied, for, the, fcc, in, the, u, s, discontinued, its, fee, for, vanity, call, sign, applications, in, september, 2015, call, sign, structure, as, prescribed, by, the, itu, consists, of, three, parts, which, break, down, as, follows, using, the, call, sign, zs1nat, as, an, example, many, countries, do, not, follow, the, itu, convention, for, the, numeral, in, the, united, kingdom, the, original, calls, g0xxx, g2xxx, g3xxx, g4xxx, were, full, a, license, holders, along, with, the, last, m0xxx, full, call, signs, issued, by, the, city, guilds, examination, authority, in, december, 2003, additional, full, licenses, were, originally, granted, to, b, licenses, with, g1xxx, g6xxx, g7xxx, g8xxx, and, 1991, onward, with, m1xxx, call, signs, the, newer, three, level, intermediate, license, holders, are, assigned, 2e0xxx, and, 2e1xxx, and, the, basic, foundation, license, holders, are, granted, call, signs, m3xxx, m6xxx, or, m7xxx, instead, of, using, numbers, in, the, uk, the, second, letter, after, the, initial, g, or, m, identifies, the, station, s, location, for, example, a, call, sign, g7ooe, becomes, gm7ooe, and, m0rdm, becomes, mm0rdm, when, that, license, holder, is, operating, a, station, in, scotland, prefix, gm, mm, are, scotland, gw, mw, are, wales, gi, mi, are, northern, ireland, gd, md, are, the, isle, of, man, gj, mj, are, jersey, and, gu, mu, are, guernsey, intermediate, licence, call, signs, are, slightly, different, they, begin, 2, 0, and, 2, 1, where, the, is, replaced, with, the, country, letters, as, above, for, example, 2m0, and, 2m1, are, scotland, 2w0, and, 2w1, are, wales, and, so, on, the, exception, however, is, for, england, the, letter, e, is, used, but, only, in, intermediate, level, call, signs, for, example, 2e0, 2e1, are, used, whereas, the, call, signs, beginning, g, or, m, for, foundation, and, full, licenses, never, use, the, e, in, the, united, states, for, non, vanity, licenses, the, numeral, indicates, the, geographical, district, the, holder, resided, in, when, the, license, was, first, issued, prior, to, 1978, us, hams, were, required, to, obtain, a, new, call, sign, if, they, moved, out, of, their, geographic, district, in, canada, call, signs, start, with, va, ve, vy, vo, and, cy, call, signs, starting, with, v, end, with, a, number, after, to, indicate, the, political, region, prefix, cy, indicates, geographic, islands, prefix, va1, or, ve1, is, nova, scotia, va2, ve2, is, quebec, va3, ve3, is, ontario, va4, ve4, is, manitoba, va5, ve5, is, saskatchewan, va6, ve6, is, alberta, va7, ve7, is, british,

two, letter, call, sign, suffixes, require, a, ham, to, have, already, been, licensed, for, 5, years, call, signs, in, canada, can, be, requested, with, a, fee, also, for, smaller, geopolitical, entities, the, numeral, may, be, part, of, the, country, identification, for, example, vp2xxx, is, in, the, british, west, indies, which, is, subdivided, into, vp2exx, anguilla, vp2mxx, montserrat, and, vp2vxx, british, virgin, islands, vp5xxx, is, in, the, turks, and, caicos, islands, vp6xxx, is, on, pitcairn, island, vp8xxx, is, in, the, falklands, and, vp9xxx, is, in, bermuda, online, callbooks, or, call, sign, databases, can, be, browsed, or, searched, to, find, out, who, holds, a, specific, call, sign, an, example, of, an, online, callbook, is, qrz, com, non, exhaustive, lists, of, famous, people, who, hold, or, have, held, amateur, radio, call, signs, have, also, been, compiled, and, published, many, jurisdictions, but, not, in, the, uk, europe, may, issue, specialty, vehicle, registration, plates, to, licensed, amateur, radio, operators, the, fees, for, application, and, renewal, are, usually, less, than, the, standard, rate, for, specialty, plates, in, most, administrations, unlike, other, rf, spectrum, users, radio, amateurs, may, build, or, modify, transmitting, equipment, for, their, own, use, within, the, amateur, spectrum, without, the, need, to, obtain, government, certification, of, the, equipment, licensed, amateurs, can, also, use, any, frequency, in, their, bands, rather, than, being, allocated, fixed, frequencies, or, channels, and, can, operate, medium, to, high, powered, equipment, on, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, so, long, as, they, meet, certain, technical, parameters, including, occupied, bandwidth, power, and, prevention, of, spurious, emission, radio, amateurs, have, access, to, frequency, allocations, throughout, the, rf, spectrum, usually, allowing, choice, of, an, effective, frequency, for, communications, across, a, local, regional, or, worldwide, path, the, shortwave, bands, or, hf, are, suitable, for, worldwide, communication, and, the, vhf, and, uhf, bands, normally, provide, local, or, regional, communication, while, the, microwave, bands, have, enough, space, or, bandwidth, for, amateur, television, transmissions, and, high, speed, computer, networks, in, most, countries, an, amateur, radio, license, grants, permission, to, the, license, holder, to, own, modify, and, operate, equipment, that, is, not, certified, by, a, governmental, regulatory, agency, this, encourages, amateur, radio, operators, to, experiment, with, home, constructed, or, modified, equipment, the, use, of, such, equipment, must, still, satisfy, national, and, international, standards, on, spurious, emissions, amateur, radio, operators, are, encouraged, both, by, regulations, and, tradition, of, respectful, use, of, the, spectrum, to, use, as, little, power, as, possible, to, accomplish, the, communication, this, is, to, minimise, interference, or, emc, to, any, other, device, although, allowable, power, levels, are, moderate, by, commercial, standards, they, are, sufficient, to, enable, global, communication, lower, license, classes, usually, have, lower, power, limits, for, example, the, lowest, license, class, in, the, uk, foundation, licence, has, a, limit, of, 10, w, power, limits, vary, from, country, to, country, and, between, license, classes, within, a, country, for, example, the, peak, envelope, power, limits, for, the, highest, available, license, classes, in, a, few, selected, countries, are, 2, 25, kw, in, canada, 1, 5, kw, in, the, united, states, 1, 0, kw, in, belgium, luxembourg, switzerland, south, africa, and, new, zealand, 750, w, in, germany, 500, w, in, italy, 400, w, in, australia, india, and, the, united, kingdom, and, 150, w, in, oman, output, power, limits, may, also, depend, on, the, mode, of, transmission, in, australia, for, example, 400, w, may, be, used, for, ssb, transmissions, but, fm, and, other, modes, are, limited, to, 120, w, the, point, at, which, power, output, is, measured, may, also, affect, transmissions, the, united, kingdom, measures, at, the, point, the, antenna, is, connected, to, the, signal, feed, cable, which, means, the, radio, system, may, transmit, more, than, 400, w, to, overcome, signal, loss, in, the, cable, conversely, germany, measures, power, at, the, output, of, the, final, amplification, stage, which, results, in, a, loss, in, radiated, power, with, longer, cable, feeds, certain, countries, permit, amateur, radio, licence, holders, to, hold, a, notice, of, variation, that, allows, higher, power, to, be, used, than, normally, allowed, for, certain, specific, purposes, e, g, in, the, uk, some, amateur, radio, licence, holders, are, allowed, to, transmit, using, 33, dbw, 2, 0, kw, for, experiments, entailing, using, the, moon, as, a, passive, radio, reflector, known, as, earth, moon, earth, communication, eme, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, governs, the, allocation, of, communications, frequencies, worldwide, with, participation, by, each, nation, s, communications, regulation, authority, national, communications, regulators, have, some, liberty, to, restrict, access, to, these, bandplan, frequencies, or, to, award, additional, allocations, as, long, as, radio, services, in, other, countries, do, not, suffer, interference, in, some, countries, specific, emission, types, are, restricted, to, certain, parts, of, the, radio, spectrum, and, in, most, other, countries, international, amateur, radio, union, iaru, member, societies, adopt, voluntary, plans, to, ensure, the, most, effective, use, of, spectrum, in, a, few, cases, a, national, telecommunication, agency, may, also, allow, hams, to, use, frequencies, outside, of, the, internationally, allocated, amateur, radio, bands, in, trinidad, and, tobago, hams, are, allowed, to, use, a, repeater, which, is, located, on, 148, 800, mhz, this, repeater, is, used, and, maintained, by, the, national, emergency, management, agency, nema, but, may, be, used, by, radio, amateurs, in, times, of, emergency, or, during, normal, times, to, test, their, capability, and, conduct, emergency, drills, this, repeater, can, also, be, used, by, non, ham, nema, staff, and, react, members, in, australia, and, new, zealand, ham, operators, are, authorized, to, use, one, of, the, uhf, tv, channels, in, the, u, s, amateur, radio, operators, providing, essential, communication, needs, in, connection, with, the, immediate, safety, of, human, life, and, immediate, protection, of, property, when, normal, communication, systems, are, not, available, may, use, any, frequency, including, those, of, other, radio, services, such, as, police, and, fire, and, in, cases, of, disaster, in, alaska, may, use, the, statewide, emergency, frequency, of, 5, 1675, mhz, with, restrictions, upon, emissions, similarly, amateurs, in, the, united, states, may, apply, to, be, registered, with, the, military, auxiliary, radio, system, mars, once, approved, and, trained, these, amateurs, also, operate, on, us, government, military, frequencies, to, provide, contingency, communications, and, morale, message, traffic, support, to, the, military, services, all, allocations, are, subject, to, variation, by, country, for, simplicity, only, common, allocations, found, internationally, are, listed, see, a, band, s, article, for, specifics, hf, allocation, created, at, the, 1979, world, administrative, radio, conference, these, are, commonly, called, the, warc, bands, this, is, not, mentioned, in, the, itu, s, table, of, frequency, allocations, but, many, individual, administrations, have, commonly, adopted, this, allocation, under, article, 4, 4, this, includes, a, currently, active, footnote, allocation, mentioned, in, the, itu, s, table, of, frequency, allocations, these, allocations, may, only, apply, to, a, group, of, countries, amateurs, use, a, variety, of, voice, text, image, and, data, communications, modes, over, radio, generally, new, modes, can, be, tested, in, the, amateur, radio, service, although, national, regulations, may, require, disclosure, of, a, new, mode, to, permit, radio, licensing, authorities, to, monitor, the, transmissions, encryption, for, example, is, not, generally, permitted, in, the, amateur, radio, service, except, for, the, special, purpose, of, satellite, vehicle, control, uplinks, the, following, is, a, partial, list, of, the, modes, of, communication, used, where, the, mode, includes, both, modulation, types, and, operating, protocols, in, former, times, most, amateur, digital, modes, were, transmitted, by, inserting, audio, into, the, microphone, input, of, a, radio, and, using, an, analog, scheme, such, as, amplitude, modulation, am, frequency, modulation, fm, or, single, sideband, modulation, ssb, beginning, in, 2017, increased, use, of, several, digital, modes, particularly, ft8, became, popular, within, the, amateur, radio, community, the, following, modes, use, no, one, specific, modulation, scheme, but, rather, are, classified, by, the, activity, of, the, communication
