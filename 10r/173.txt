standardization, american, english, or, standardisation, british, english, is, the, process, of, implementing, and, developing, technical, standards, based, on, the, consensus, of, different, parties, that, include, firms, users, interest, groups, standards, organizations, and, governments, standardization, can, help, maximize, compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or, quality, it, can, also, facilitate, a, normalization, of, formerly, custom, processes, in, social, sciences, including, economics, the, idea, of, standardization, is, close, to, the, solution, for, a, coordination, problem, a, situation, in, which, all, parties, can, realize, mutual, gains, but, only, by, making, mutually, consistent, decisions, divergent, national, standards, impose, costs, on, consumers, and, can, be, a, form, of, non, tariff, trade, barrier, standard, weights, and, measures, were, developed, by, the, indus, valley, civilization, the, centralized, weight, and, measure, system, served, the, commercial, interest, of, indus, merchants, as, smaller, weight, measures, were, used, to, measure, luxury, goods, while, larger, weights, were, employed, for, buying, bulkier, items, such, as, food, grains, etc, weights, existed, in, multiples, of, a, standard, weight, and, in, categories, technical, standardisation, enabled, gauging, devices, to, be, effectively, used, in, angular, measurement, and, measurement, for, construction, uniform, units, of, length, were, used, in, the, planning, of, towns, such, as, lothal, surkotada, kalibangan, dolavira, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, the, weights, and, measures, of, the, indus, civilization, also, reached, persia, and, central, asia, where, they, were, further, modified, shigeo, iwata, describes, the, excavated, weights, unearthed, from, the, indus, civilization, a, total, of, 558, weights, were, excavated, from, mohenjodaro, harappa, and, chanhu, daro, not, including, defective, weights, they, did, not, find, statistically, significant, differences, between, weights, that, were, excavated, from, five, different, layers, each, measuring, about, 1, 5, m, in, depth, this, was, evidence, that, strong, control, existed, for, at, least, a, 500, year, period, the, 13, 7, g, weight, seems, to, be, one, of, the, units, used, in, the, indus, valley, the, notation, was, based, on, the, binary, and, decimal, systems, 83, of, the, weights, which, were, excavated, from, the, above, three, cities, were, cubic, and, 68, were, made, of, chert, the, implementation, of, standards, in, industry, and, commerce, became, highly, important, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, need, for, high, precision, machine, tools, and, interchangeable, parts, henry, maudslay, developed, the, first, industrially, practical, screw, cutting, lathe, in, 1800, this, allowed, for, the, standardization, of, screw, thread, sizes, for, the, first, time, and, paved, the, way, for, the, practical, application, of, interchangeability, an, idea, that, was, already, taking, hold, to, nuts, and, bolts, before, this, screw, threads, were, usually, made, by, chipping, and, filing, that, is, with, skilled, freehand, use, of, chisels, and, files, nuts, were, rare, metal, screws, when, made, at, all, were, usually, for, use, in, wood, metal, bolts, passing, through, wood, framing, to, a, metal, fastening, on, the, other, side, were, usually, fastened, in, non, threaded, ways, such, as, clinching, or, upsetting, against, a, washer, maudslay, standardized, the, screw, threads, used, in, his, workshop, and, produced, sets, of, taps, and, dies, that, would, make, nuts, and, bolts, consistently, to, those, standards, so, that, any, bolt, of, the, appropriate, size, would, fit, any, nut, of, the, same, size, this, was, a, major, advance, in, workshop, technology, maudslay, s, work, as, well, as, the, contributions, of, other, engineers, accomplished, a, modest, amount, of, industry, standardization, some, companies, in, house, standards, spread, a, bit, within, their, industries, joseph, whitworth, s, screw, thread, measurements, were, adopted, as, the, first, unofficial, national, standard, by, companies, around, the, country, in, 1841, it, came, to, be, known, as, the, british, standard, whitworth, and, was, widely, adopted, in, other, countries, this, new, standard, specified, a, 55, thread, angle, and, a, thread, depth, of, 0, 640327, p, and, a, radius, of, 0, 137329, p, where, p, is, the, pitch, the, thread, pitch, increased, with, diameter, in, steps, specified, on, a, chart, an, example, of, the, use, of, the, whitworth, thread, is, the, royal, navy, s, crimean, war, gunboats, these, were, the, first, instance, of, mass, production, techniques, being, applied, to, marine, engineering, with, the, adoption, of, bsw, by, british, railway, lines, many, of, which, had, previously, used, their, own, standard, both, for, threads, and, for, bolt, head, and, nut, profiles, and, improving, manufacturing, techniques, it, came, to, dominate, british, manufacturing, american, unified, coarse, was, originally, based, on, almost, the, same, imperial, fractions, the, unified, thread, angle, is, 60, and, has, flattened, crests, whitworth, crests, are, rounded, thread, pitch, is, the, same, in, both, systems, except, that, the, thread, pitch, for, the, 1, 2, in, inch, bolt, is, 12, threads, per, inch, tpi, in, bsw, versus, 13, tpi, in, the, unc, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, differences, in, standards, between, companies, was, making, trade, increasingly, difficult, and, strained, for, instance, an, iron, and, steel, dealer, recorded, his, displeasure, in, the, times, architects, and, engineers, generally, specify, such, unnecessarily, diverse, types, of, sectional, material, or, given, work, that, anything, like, economical, and, continuous, manufacture, becomes, impossible, in, this, country, no, two, professional, men, are, agreed, upon, the, size, and, weight, of, a, girder, to, employ, for, given, work, the, engineering, standards, committee, was, established, in, london, in, 1901, as, the, world, s, first, national, standards, body, it, subsequently, extended, its, standardization, work, and, became, the, british, engineering, standards, association, in, 1918, adopting, the, name, british, standards, institution, in, 1931, after, receiving, its, royal, charter, in, 1929, the, national, standards, were, adopted, universally, throughout, the, country, and, enabled, the, markets, to, act, more, rationally, and, efficiently, with, an, increased, level, of, cooperation, after, the, first, world, war, similar, national, bodies, were, established, in, other, countries, the, deutsches, institut, f, r, normung, was, set, up, in, germany, in, 1917, followed, by, its, counterparts, the, american, national, standard, institute, and, the, french, commission, permanente, de, standardisation, both, in, 1918, at, a, regional, level, e, g, europa, the, americas, africa, etc, or, at, subregional, level, e, g, mercosur, andean, community, south, east, asia, south, east, africa, etc, several, regional, standardization, organizations, exist, see, also, standards, organization, the, three, regional, standards, organizations, in, europe, european, standardization, organizations, esos, recognised, by, the, eu, regulation, on, standardization, regulation, eu, 1025, 2012, are, cen, cenelec, and, etsi, cen, develops, standards, for, numerous, kinds, of, products, materials, services, and, processes, some, sectors, covered, by, cen, include, transport, equipment, and, services, chemicals, construction, consumer, products, defence, and, security, energy, food, and, feed, health, and, safety, healthcare, digital, sector, machinery, or, services, the, european, committee, for, electrotechnical, standardization, cenelec, is, the, european, standardization, organization, developing, standards, in, the, electrotechnical, area, and, corresponding, to, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, in, europe, the, first, modern, international, organization, intergovernmental, organization, the, international, telegraph, union, now, international, telecommunication, union, was, created, in, 1865, to, set, international, standards, in, order, to, connect, national, telegraph, networks, as, a, merger, of, two, predecessor, organizations, bern, and, paris, treaties, that, had, similar, objectives, but, in, more, limited, territories, with, the, advent, of, radiocommunication, soon, after, the, creation, the, work, of, the, itu, quickly, expanded, from, the, standardization, of, telegraph, communications, to, developing, standards, for, telecommunications, in, general, by, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, efforts, were, being, made, to, standardize, electrical, measurement, lord, kelvin, was, an, important, figure, in, this, process, introducing, accurate, methods, and, apparatus, for, measuring, electricity, in, 1857, he, introduced, a, series, of, effective, instruments, including, the, quadrant, electrometer, which, cover, the, entire, field, of, electrostatic, measurement, he, invented, the, current, balance, also, known, as, the, kelvin, balance, or, ampere, balance, sic, for, the, precise, specification, of, the, ampere, the, standard, unit, of, electric, current, r, e, b, crompton, became, concerned, by, the, large, range, of, different, standards, and, systems, used, by, electrical, engineering, companies, and, scientists, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, companies, had, entered, the, market, in, the, 1890s, and, all, chose, their, own, settings, for, voltage, frequency, current, and, even, the, symbols, used, on, circuit, diagrams, adjacent, buildings, would, have, totally, incompatible, electrical, systems, simply, because, they, had, been, fitted, out, by, different, companies, crompton, could, see, the, lack, of, efficiency, in, this, system, and, began, to, consider, proposals, for, an, international, standard, for, electric, engineering, in, 1904, crompton, represented, britain, at, the, international, electrical, congress, held, in, connection, with, louisiana, purchase, exposition, in, saint, louis, as, part, of, a, delegation, by, the, institute, of, electrical, engineers, he, presented, a, paper, on, standardisation, which, was, so, well, received, that, he, was, asked, to, look, into, the, formation, of, a, commission, to, oversee, the, process, by, 1906, his, work, was, complete, and, he, drew, up, a, permanent, constitution, for, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, the, body, held, its, first, meeting, that, year, in, london, with, representatives, from, 14, countries, in, honour, of, his, contribution, to, electrical, standardisation, lord, kelvin, was, elected, as, the, body, s, first, president, the, international, federation, of, the, national, standardizing, associations, isa, was, founded, in, 1926, with, a, broader, remit, to, enhance, international, cooperation, for, all, technical, standards, and, specifications, the, body, was, suspended, in, 1942, during, world, war, ii, after, the, war, isa, was, approached, by, the, recently, formed, united, nations, standards, coordinating, committee, unscc, with, a, proposal, to, form, a, new, global, standards, body, in, october, 1946, isa, and, unscc, delegates, from, 25, countries, met, in, london, and, agreed, to, join, forces, to, create, the, new, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, the, new, organization, officially, began, operations, in, february, 1947, in, general, each, country, or, economy, has, a, single, recognized, national, standards, body, nsb, examples, include, abnt, aenor, now, called, une, spanish, association, for, standardization, afnor, ansi, bsi, dgn, din, iram, jisc, kats, sabs, sac, scc, sis, an, nsb, is, likely, the, sole, member, from, that, economy, in, iso, nsbs, may, be, either, public, or, private, sector, organizations, or, combinations, of, the, two, for, example, the, three, nsbs, of, canada, mexico, and, the, united, states, are, respectively, the, standards, council, of, canada, scc, the, general, bureau, of, standards, direcci, n, general, de, normas, dgn, and, the, american, national, standards, institute, ansi, scc, is, a, canadian, crown, corporation, dgn, is, a, governmental, agency, within, the, mexican, ministry, of, economy, and, ansi, and, aenor, are, a, 501, c, 3, non, profit, organization, with, members, from, both, the, private, and, public, sectors, the, determinants, of, whether, an, nsb, for, a, particular, economy, is, a, public, or, private, sector, body, may, include, the, historical, and, traditional, roles, that, the, private, sector, fills, in, public, affairs, in, that, economy, or, the, development, stage, of, that, economy, standards, can, be, the, existence, of, a, published, standard, does, not, necessarily, imply, that, it, is, useful, or, correct, just, because, an, item, is, stamped, with, a, standard, number, does, not, by, itself, indicate, that, the, item, is, fit, for, any, particular, use, the, people, who, use, the, item, or, service, engineers, trade, unions, etc, or, specify, it, building, codes, government, industry, etc, have, the, responsibility, to, consider, the, available, standards, specify, the, correct, one, enforce, compliance, and, use, the, item, correctly, validation, and, verification, to, avoid, the, proliferation, of, industry, standards, also, referred, to, as, private, standards, regulators, in, the, united, states, are, instructed, by, their, government, offices, to, adopt, voluntary, consensus, standards, before, relying, upon, industry, standards, or, developing, government, standards, regulatory, authorities, can, reference, voluntary, consensus, standards, to, translate, internationally, accepted, criteria, into, public, policy, in, the, context, of, information, exchange, standardization, refers, to, the, process, of, developing, standards, for, specific, business, processes, using, specific, formal, languages, these, standards, are, usually, developed, in, voluntary, consensus, standards, bodies, such, as, the, united, nations, center, for, trade, facilitation, and, electronic, business, un, cefact, the, world, wide, web, consortium, w3c, the, telecommunications, industry, association, tia, and, the, organization, for, the, advancement, of, structured, information, standards, oasis, there, are, many, specifications, that, govern, the, operation, and, interaction, of, devices, and, software, on, the, internet, which, do, not, use, the, term, standard, in, their, names, the, w3c, for, example, publishes, recommendations, and, the, ietf, publishes, requests, for, comments, rfcs, nevertheless, these, publications, are, often, referred, to, as, standards, because, they, are, the, products, of, regular, standardization, processes, standardized, product, certifications, such, as, of, organic, food, buildings, or, possibly, sustainable, seafood, as, well, as, standardized, product, safety, evaluation, and, dis, approval, procedures, e, g, regulation, of, chemicals, cosmetics, and, food, safety, can, protect, the, environment, this, effect, may, depend, on, associated, modified, consumer, choices, strategic, product, support, obstruction, requirements, and, bans, as, well, as, their, accordance, with, a, scientific, basis, the, robustness, and, applicability, of, a, scientific, basis, whether, adoption, of, the, certifications, is, voluntary, and, the, socioeconomic, context, systems, of, governance, and, the, economy, with, possibly, most, certifications, being, so, far, mostly, largely, ineffective, moreover, standardized, scientific, frameworks, can, enable, evaluation, of, levels, of, environmental, protection, such, as, of, marine, protected, areas, and, serve, as, potentially, evolving, guides, for, improving, planning, and, monitoring, the, protection, quality, scopes, and, extents, moreover, technical, standards, could, decrease, electronic, waste, and, reduce, resource, needs, such, as, by, thereby, requiring, or, enabling, products, to, be, interoperable, compatible, with, other, products, infrastructures, environments, etc, durable, energy, efficient, modular, upgradeable, repairable, and, recyclable, and, conform, to, versatile, optimal, standards, and, protocols, such, standardization, is, not, limited, to, the, domain, of, electronic, devices, like, smartphones, and, phone, chargers, but, could, also, be, applied, to, e, g, the, energy, infrastructure, policy, makers, could, develop, policies, fostering, standard, design, and, interfaces, and, promoting, the, re, use, of, modules, and, components, across, plants, to, develop, more, sustainable, energy, infrastructure, computers, and, the, internet, are, some, of, the, tools, that, could, be, used, to, increase, practicability, and, reduce, suboptimal, results, detrimental, standards, and, bureaucracy, which, is, often, associated, with, traditional, processes, and, results, of, standardization, taxes, and, subsidies, and, funding, of, research, and, development, could, be, used, complementarily, standardized, measurement, is, used, in, monitoring, reporting, and, verification, frameworks, of, environmental, impacts, usually, of, companies, for, example, to, prevent, underreporting, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, firms, in, routine, product, testing, and, product, analysis, results, can, be, reported, using, official, or, informal, standards, it, can, be, done, to, increase, consumer, protection, to, ensure, safety, or, healthiness, or, efficiency, or, performance, or, sustainability, of, products, it, can, be, carried, out, by, the, manufacturer, an, independent, laboratory, a, government, agency, a, magazine, or, others, on, a, voluntary, or, commissioned, mandated, basis, estimating, the, environmental, impacts, of, food, products, in, a, standardized, way, as, has, been, done, with, a, dataset, of, 57, 000, food, products, in, supermarkets, could, e, g, be, used, to, inform, consumers, or, in, policy, for, example, such, may, be, useful, for, approaches, using, personal, carbon, allowances, or, similar, quota, or, for, targeted, alteration, of, ultimate, overall, costs, public, information, symbols, e, g, hazard, symbols, especially, when, related, to, safety, are, often, standardized, sometimes, on, the, international, level, standardization, is, also, used, to, ensure, safe, design, and, operation, of, laboratories, and, similar, potentially, dangerous, workplaces, e, g, to, ensure, biosafety, levels, there, is, research, into, microbiology, safety, standards, used, in, clinical, and, research, laboratories, in, the, context, of, defense, standardization, has, been, defined, by, nato, as, the, development, and, implementation, of, concepts, doctrines, procedures, and, designs, to, achieve, and, maintain, the, required, levels, of, compatibility, interchangeability, or, commonality, in, the, operational, procedural, material, technical, and, administrative, fields, to, attain, interoperability, in, some, cases, standards, are, being, used, in, the, design, and, operation, of, workplaces, and, products, that, can, impact, consumers, health, some, of, such, standards, seek, to, ensure, occupational, safety, and, health, and, ergonomics, for, example, chairs, see, e, g, active, sitting, and, steps, of, research, could, be, potentially, be, designed, and, chosen, using, standards, that, may, or, may, not, be, based, on, adequate, scientific, data, standards, could, reduce, the, variety, of, products, and, lead, to, convergence, on, fewer, broad, designs, which, can, often, be, efficiently, mass, produced, via, common, shared, automated, procedures, and, instruments, or, formulations, deemed, to, be, the, most, healthy, most, efficient, or, best, compromise, between, healthiness, and, other, factors, standardization, is, sometimes, or, could, also, be, used, to, ensure, or, increase, or, enable, consumer, health, protection, beyond, the, workplace, and, ergonomics, such, as, standards, in, food, food, production, hygiene, products, tab, water, cosmetics, drugs, medicine, drink, and, dietary, supplements, especially, in, cases, where, there, is, robust, scientific, data, that, suggests, detrimental, impacts, on, health, e, g, of, ingredients, despite, being, substitutable, and, not, necessarily, of, consumer, interest, in, the, context, of, assessment, standardization, may, define, how, a, measuring, instrument, or, procedure, is, similar, to, every, subjects, or, patients, 399, 71, for, example, educational, psychologist, may, adopt, structured, interview, to, systematically, interview, the, people, in, concern, by, delivering, the, same, procedures, all, subjects, is, evaluated, using, same, criteria, and, minimising, any, confounding, variable, that, reduce, the, validity, 72, some, other, example, includes, mental, status, examination, and, personality, test, in, the, context, of, social, criticism, and, social, science, standardization, often, means, the, process, of, establishing, standards, of, various, kinds, and, improving, efficiency, to, handle, people, their, interactions, cases, and, so, forth, examples, include, formalization, of, judicial, procedure, in, court, and, establishing, uniform, criteria, for, diagnosing, mental, disease, standardization, in, this, sense, is, often, discussed, along, with, or, synonymously, to, such, large, scale, social, changes, as, modernization, bureaucratization, homogenization, and, centralization, of, society, in, the, context, of, customer, service, standardization, refers, to, the, process, of, developing, an, international, standard, that, enables, organizations, to, focus, on, customer, service, while, at, the, same, time, providing, recognition, of, success, through, a, third, party, organization, such, as, the, british, standards, institution, an, international, standard, has, been, developed, by, the, international, customer, service, institute, in, the, context, of, supply, chain, management, and, materials, management, standardization, covers, the, process, of, specification, and, use, of, any, item, the, company, must, buy, in, or, make, allowable, substitutions, and, build, or, buy, decisions, the, process, of, standardization, can, itself, be, standardized, there, are, at, least, four, levels, of, standardization, compatibility, interchangeability, commonality, and, reference, these, standardization, processes, create, compatibility, similarity, measurement, and, symbol, standards, there, are, typically, four, different, techniques, for, standardization, types, of, standardization, process, standardization, has, a, variety, of, benefits, and, drawbacks, for, firms, and, consumers, participating, in, the, market, and, on, technology, and, innovation, the, primary, effect, of, standardization, on, firms, is, that, the, basis, of, competition, is, shifted, from, integrated, systems, to, individual, components, within, the, system, prior, to, standardization, a, company, s, product, must, span, the, entire, system, because, individual, components, from, different, competitors, are, incompatible, but, after, standardization, each, company, can, focus, on, providing, an, individual, component, of, the, system, when, the, shift, toward, competition, based, on, individual, components, takes, place, firms, selling, tightly, integrated, systems, must, quickly, shift, to, a, modular, approach, supplying, other, companies, with, subsystems, or, components, standardization, has, a, variety, of, benefits, for, consumers, but, one, of, the, greatest, benefits, is, enhanced, network, effects, standards, increase, compatibility, and, interoperability, between, products, allowing, information, to, be, shared, within, a, larger, network, and, attracting, more, consumers, to, use, the, new, technology, further, enhancing, network, effects, other, benefits, of, standardization, to, consumers, are, reduced, uncertainty, because, consumers, can, be, more, certain, that, they, are, not, choosing, the, wrong, product, and, reduced, lock, in, because, the, standard, makes, it, more, likely, that, there, will, be, competing, products, in, the, space, consumers, may, also, get, the, benefit, of, being, able, to, mix, and, match, components, of, a, system, to, align, with, their, specific, preferences, once, these, initial, benefits, of, standardization, are, realized, further, benefits, that, accrue, to, consumers, as, a, result, of, using, the, standard, are, driven, mostly, by, the, quality, of, the, technologies, underlying, that, standard, probably, the, greatest, downside, of, standardization, for, consumers, is, lack, of, variety, there, is, no, guarantee, that, the, chosen, standard, will, meet, all, consumers, needs, or, even, that, the, standard, is, the, best, available, option, another, downside, is, that, if, a, standard, is, agreed, upon, before, products, are, available, in, the, market, then, consumers, are, deprived, of, the, penetration, pricing, that, often, results, when, rivals, are, competing, to, rapidly, increase, market, share, in, an, attempt, to, increase, the, likelihood, that, their, product, will, become, the, standard, it, is, also, possible, that, a, consumer, will, choose, a, product, based, upon, a, standard, that, fails, to, become, dominant, in, this, case, the, consumer, will, have, spent, resources, on, a, product, that, is, ultimately, less, useful, to, him, or, her, as, the, result, of, the, standardization, process, much, like, the, effect, on, consumers, the, effect, of, standardization, on, technology, and, innovation, is, mixed, meanwhile, the, various, links, between, research, and, standardization, have, been, identified, also, as, a, platform, of, knowledge, transfer, and, translated, into, policy, measures, e, g, wipano, increased, adoption, of, a, new, technology, as, a, result, of, standardization, is, important, because, rival, and, incompatible, approaches, competing, in, the, marketplace, can, slow, or, even, kill, the, growth, of, the, technology, a, state, known, as, market, fragmentation, the, shift, to, a, modularized, architecture, as, a, result, of, standardization, brings, increased, flexibility, rapid, introduction, of, new, products, and, the, ability, to, more, closely, meet, individual, customer, s, needs, the, negative, effects, of, standardization, on, technology, have, to, do, with, its, tendency, to, restrict, new, technology, and, innovation, standards, shift, competition, from, features, to, price, because, the, features, are, defined, by, the, standard, the, degree, to, which, this, is, true, depends, on, the, specificity, of, the, standard, standardization, in, an, area, also, rules, out, alternative, technologies, as, options, while, encouraging, others
