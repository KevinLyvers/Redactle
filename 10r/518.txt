a, military, aircraft, is, any, fixed, wing, or, rotary, wing, aircraft, that, is, operated, by, a, legal, or, insurrectionary, military, of, any, type, military, aircraft, can, be, either, combat, or, non, combat, in, 1783, when, the, first, practical, aircraft, hot, air, and, hydrogen, balloons, were, established, they, were, quickly, adopted, for, military, duties, the, first, military, balloon, unit, was, the, french, aerostatic, corps, who, in, 1794, flew, an, observation, balloon, during, the, battle, of, fleurus, the, first, major, battle, to, feature, aerial, observation, balloons, continued, to, be, used, throughout, the, 19th, century, including, in, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, franco, prussian, war, for, observation, and, propaganda, distribution, during, world, war, i, german, zeppelin, airships, carried, out, multiple, air, raids, on, british, cities, as, well, as, being, used, for, observation, in, the, 1920s, the, u, s, navy, acquired, several, non, rigid, airships, the, first, one, to, see, service, being, the, k, 1, in, 1931, use, by, the, u, s, as, well, as, other, countries, continued, into, world, war, ii, the, u, s, navy, retired, its, last, balloons, in, 1963, only, a, handful, of, lighter, than, air, military, aircraft, were, used, since, such, as, the, american, blimp, mz, 3, used, for, research, and, development, by, the, u, s, navy, from, 2006, to, 2017, soon, after, the, first, flight, of, the, wright, flyer, several, militaries, became, interested, in, powered, aircraft, in, 1909, the, united, states, army, purchased, the, wright, military, flyer, a, two, seat, observation, aircraft, for, the, aeronautical, division, u, s, signal, corps, it, served, until, 1911, by, which, time, powered, aircraft, had, become, an, important, feature, in, several, armies, around, the, world, airplanes, performed, aerial, reconnaissance, and, tactical, bombing, missions, in, the, italo, turkish, war, and, the, first, balkan, war, saw, the, first, naval, air, operations, photoreconnaissance, and, propaganda, leaflet, drops, followed, in, the, second, balkan, war, air, combat, was, a, notable, component, of, world, war, i, as, fighter, aircraft, were, developed, during, the, war, long, range, strategic, bombing, became, a, possibility, and, airplanes, were, deployed, from, aircraft, carriers, airplanes, also, took, on, a, greater, variety, of, support, roles, notably, medical, evacuation, and, deployed, new, weapons, like, air, to, air, rockets, for, use, against, reconnaissance, balloons, aviation, technology, advanced, rapidly, in, the, interwar, period, and, military, aircraft, became, increasingly, capable, autogyros, and, helicopters, were, also, developed, at, this, time, during, world, war, ii, military, aviation, reached, new, heights, decisive, air, battles, influenced, the, outcome, of, the, war, early, jet, aircraft, flew, combat, missions, cruise, missiles, and, ballistic, missiles, were, deployed, for, the, first, time, airborne, troops, and, cargo, parachuted, into, battle, and, the, nuclear, weapons, that, ended, the, war, were, delivered, by, air, in, the, cold, war, era, aviation, technology, continued, to, advance, at, an, extremely, rapid, pace, jet, aircraft, exceeded, mach, 1, and, mach, 2, armament, focus, switched, mainly, to, missiles, aircraft, began, carrying, more, sophisticated, avionics, air, to, air, refueling, matured, into, practicality, and, transport, aircraft, grew, in, size, stealth, aircraft, entered, development, during, the, 1970s, and, saw, combat, in, the, 1980s, combat, aircraft, or, warplanes, are, divided, broadly, into, fighters, bombers, attackers, electronic, warfare, maritime, multirole, and, unmanned, aircraft, variations, exist, between, them, including, fighter, bombers, such, as, the, mig, 23, ground, attack, aircraft, and, the, soviet, ilyushin, il, 2, also, included, among, combat, aircraft, are, long, range, maritime, patrol, aircraft, such, as, the, hawker, siddeley, nimrod, and, the, s, 3, viking, that, are, often, equipped, to, attack, with, anti, ship, missiles, and, anti, submarine, weapons, the, primary, role, of, fighters, is, destroying, enemy, aircraft, in, air, to, air, combat, as, part, of, both, offensive, and, defensive, counter, air, operations, many, fighters, also, possess, a, degree, of, ground, attack, capability, allowing, them, to, perform, surface, attack, and, close, air, support, missions, in, addition, to, their, counter, air, duties, they, are, tasked, to, perform, escort, mission, for, bombers, or, other, aircraft, fighters, are, capable, of, carrying, a, variety, of, weapons, including, machine, guns, autocannons, rockets, guided, missiles, and, bombs, many, modern, fighters, can, attack, enemy, fighters, from, a, great, distance, before, the, enemy, even, sees, or, detects, them, examples, of, such, fighters, include, the, f, 35, lightning, ii, f, 22, raptor, f, 15, eagle, and, su, 27, bombers, are, normally, larger, heavier, and, less, maneuverable, than, fighter, aircraft, they, are, capable, of, carrying, large, payloads, of, bombs, torpedoes, or, cruise, missiles, bombers, are, used, almost, exclusively, for, ground, attacks, and, are, not, fast, or, agile, enough, to, take, on, enemy, fighters, head, to, head, some, have, a, single, engine, and, require, one, pilot, to, operate, while, others, have, two, or, more, engines, and, require, crews, of, two, or, more, a, limited, number, of, bombers, such, as, the, b, 2, spirit, have, stealth, capabilities, that, keep, them, from, being, detected, by, enemy, radar, an, example, of, a, conventional, modern, bomber, would, be, the, b, 52, stratofortress, an, example, of, a, world, war, ii, bomber, would, be, a, b, 17, flying, fortress, an, example, of, a, world, war, i, bomber, would, be, a, handley, page, o, 400, bombers, include, light, bombers, medium, bombers, heavy, bombers, dive, bombers, and, torpedo, bombers, attack, aircraft, can, be, used, to, provide, support, for, friendly, ground, troops, some, are, able, to, carry, conventional, or, nuclear, weapons, far, behind, enemy, lines, to, strike, priority, ground, targets, attack, helicopters, attack, enemy, armor, and, provide, close, air, support, for, ground, troops, an, example, of, a, historical, ground, attack, aircraft, is, the, soviet, ilyushin, il, 2, several, types, of, transport, airplanes, have, been, armed, with, sideways, firing, weapons, as, gunships, for, ground, attack, these, include, the, ac, 47, and, ac, 130, gunships, an, electronic, warfare, aircraft, is, a, military, aircraft, equipped, for, electronic, warfare, i, e, degrading, the, effectiveness, of, enemy, radar, and, radio, systems, they, are, generally, modified, versions, of, other, preexisting, aircraft, a, recent, example, would, be, the, ea, 18g, growler, which, is, a, modified, version, of, the, f, a, 18f, super, hornet, a, maritime, patrol, aircraft, is, a, fixed, wing, military, aircraft, designed, to, operate, for, long, durations, over, water, in, maritime, patrol, roles, in, particular, anti, submarine, anti, ship, and, search, and, rescue, some, patrol, aircraft, were, designed, for, this, purpose, like, the, kawasaki, p, 1, many, others, are, modified, designs, of, pre, existing, aircraft, such, as, the, boeing, p, 8, poseidon, which, is, based, on, the, boeing, 737, 800, airliner, while, the, term, maritime, patrol, aircraft, generally, refers, to, fixed, wing, aircraft, other, aircraft, types, such, as, blimps, and, helicopters, have, also, been, used, in, the, same, roles, many, combat, aircraft, in, the, modern, day, have, multirole, capabilities, normally, only, applied, to, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, term, signifies, the, ability, to, transition, between, air, to, air, and, air, to, ground, roles, sometimes, even, during, the, same, mission, an, example, of, a, multirole, design, is, the, f, 15e, strike, eagle, eurofighter, typhoon, the, rafale, dassault, and, panavia, tornado, a, world, war, ii, example, would, be, the, p, 38, lightning, a, utility, helicopter, could, also, count, as, a, multirole, aircraft, and, can, fill, roles, such, as, close, air, support, air, assault, military, logistics, casevac, medical, evacuation, command, and, control, and, troop, transport, unmanned, combat, aerial, vehicles, ucav, have, no, crew, but, are, controlled, by, a, remote, operator, they, may, have, varying, degrees, of, autonomy, ucavs, are, often, armed, with, bombs, air, to, surface, missiles, or, other, aircraft, ordinance, their, uses, typically, include, targeted, killings, precision, airstrikes, and, air, interdictions, as, well, as, other, forms, of, drone, warfare, non, combat, roles, of, military, aircraft, include, search, and, rescue, reconnaissance, observation, surveillance, airborne, early, warning, and, control, transport, training, and, aerial, refueling, many, civil, aircraft, both, fixed, wing, and, rotary, wing, have, been, produced, in, separate, models, for, military, use, such, as, the, civilian, douglas, dc, 3, airliner, which, became, the, military, c, 47, skytrain, and, british, dakota, transport, planes, and, decades, later, the, usaf, s, ac, 47, spooky, gunships, even, the, fabric, covered, two, seat, piper, j, 3, cub, had, a, military, version, gliders, and, balloons, have, also, been, used, as, military, aircraft, for, example, balloons, were, used, for, observation, during, the, american, civil, war, and, during, world, war, i, and, military, gliders, were, used, during, world, war, ii, to, deliver, ground, troops, in, airborne, assaults, military, transport, logistics, aircraft, are, primarily, used, to, transport, troops, and, war, supplies, cargo, can, be, attached, to, pallets, which, are, easily, loaded, secured, for, flight, and, quickly, unloaded, for, delivery, cargo, also, may, be, discharged, from, flying, aircraft, on, parachutes, eliminating, the, need, for, landing, also, included, in, this, category, are, aerial, tankers, these, planes, can, refuel, other, aircraft, while, in, flight, an, example, of, a, transport, aircraft, is, the, c, 17, globemaster, iii, a, world, war, ii, example, would, be, the, c, 47, an, example, of, a, tanker, craft, would, be, the, kc, 135, stratotanker, transport, helicopters, and, gliders, can, transport, troops, and, supplies, to, areas, where, other, aircraft, would, be, unable, to, land, calling, a, military, transport, aircraft, a, cargo, plane, is, inaccurate, because, military, transport, planes, are, able, to, carry, paratroopers, and, other, personnel, an, airborne, early, warning, and, control, aew, c, system, is, an, airborne, radar, system, designed, to, detect, aircraft, ships, and, ground, vehicles, at, long, ranges, and, control, and, command, the, battle, space, in, an, air, engagement, by, directing, fighter, and, attack, aircraft, strikes, aew, c, units, are, also, used, to, carry, out, surveillance, including, over, ground, targets, and, frequently, perform, c2bm, command, and, control, battle, management, functions, similar, to, an, airport, traffic, controller, given, military, command, over, other, forces, used, at, a, high, altitude, the, radars, on, the, aircraft, allow, the, operators, to, distinguish, between, friendly, and, hostile, aircraft, hundreds, of, miles, away, aew, c, aircraft, are, used, for, both, defensive, and, offensive, air, operations, and, are, to, the, nato, and, american, trained, or, integrated, air, forces, what, the, combat, information, center, is, to, a, naval, vessel, plus, a, highly, mobile, and, powerful, radar, platform, the, system, is, used, offensively, to, direct, fighters, to, their, target, locations, and, defensively, in, order, to, counterattacks, by, enemy, forces, both, air, and, ground, so, useful, is, the, advantage, of, command, and, control, from, a, high, altitude, the, united, states, navy, operates, aew, c, aircraft, off, its, supercarriers, to, augment, and, protect, its, carrier, combat, information, center, cics, aew, c, is, also, known, by, the, older, terms, airborne, early, warning, aew, and, airborne, warning, and, control, system, awacs, e, w, ks, ay, waks, although, awacs, is, the, name, of, a, specific, system, currently, used, by, nato, and, the, usaf, and, is, often, used, in, error, to, describe, similar, systems, reconnaissance, aircraft, are, primarily, used, to, gather, intelligence, they, are, equipped, with, cameras, and, other, sensors, these, aircraft, may, be, specially, designed, or, may, be, modified, from, a, basic, fighter, or, bomber, type, this, role, is, increasingly, being, filled, by, military, satellites, and, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, uavs, surveillance, and, observation, aircraft, use, radar, and, other, sensors, for, battlefield, surveillance, airspace, surveillance, maritime, patrol, and, artillery, spotting, they, include, modified, civil, aircraft, designs, moored, balloons, and, uavs, experimental, aircraft, are, designed, in, order, to, test, advanced, aerodynamic, structural, avionic, or, propulsion, concepts, these, are, usually, well, instrumented, with, performance, data, telemetered, on, radio, frequency, data, links, to, ground, stations, located, at, the, test, ranges, where, they, are, flown, an, example, of, an, experimental, aircraft, is, the, bristol, 188, media, related, to, military,
