an, arch, is, a, curved, vertical, structure, spanning, an, open, space, underneath, it, arches, may, support, the, load, above, them, or, they, may, perform, a, purely, decorative, role, as, a, decorative, element, the, arch, dates, back, to, the, 4th, millennium, bc, but, structural, load, bearing, arches, became, popular, only, after, their, adoption, by, the, ancient, romans, in, the, 4th, century, bc, arch, like, structures, can, be, horizontal, like, an, arch, dam, that, withstands, the, horizontal, hydrostatic, pressure, load, arches, are, normally, used, as, supports, for, many, types, of, vaults, with, the, barrel, vault, in, particular, being, a, continuous, arch, extensive, use, of, arches, and, vaults, characterizes, an, arcuated, construction, as, opposed, to, the, trabeated, system, where, like, in, the, architectures, of, ancient, greece, china, and, japan, as, well, as, the, modern, steel, framed, technique, posts, and, beams, dominate, arches, had, several, advantages, over, the, lintel, especially, in, the, masonry, construction, with, the, same, amount, of, material, it, can, have, larger, span, carry, more, weight, and, can, be, made, from, smaller, and, thus, more, manageable, pieces, their, role, in, construction, was, diminished, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, with, introduction, of, the, wrought, iron, and, later, steel, the, high, tensile, strength, of, these, new, materials, made, long, lintels, possible, a, true, arch, is, a, load, bearing, arc, with, elements, held, together, by, compression, in, much, of, the, world, introduction, of, the, true, arch, was, a, result, of, european, influence, the, term, false, arch, has, few, meanings, it, is, usually, used, to, designate, an, arch, that, has, no, structural, purpose, like, a, proscenium, arch, in, theaters, used, to, frame, the, performance, for, the, spectators, but, is, also, applied, to, corbelled, and, triangular, arches, that, are, not, based, on, compression, a, typical, true, masonry, arch, consists, of, the, following, elements, a, left, or, right, half, segment, of, an, arch, is, called, an, arc, the, overall, line, of, an, arch, is, arcature, this, term, is, also, used, for, an, arcade, archivolt, is, the, exposed, front, facing, part, of, the, arch, sometimes, decorated, occasionally, also, used, to, designate, the, intrados, if, the, sides, of, voussoir, blocks, are, not, straight, but, include, angles, and, curves, for, interlocking, the, arch, is, called, joggled, a, true, arch, due, to, its, rise, resolves, the, vertical, loads, into, horizontal, and, vertical, reactions, at, the, ends, a, so, called, arch, action, the, vertical, load, produces, a, positive, bending, moment, in, the, arch, while, the, inward, directed, horizontal, reaction, from, the, spandrel, abutment, provides, a, counterbalancing, negative, moment, as, a, result, the, bending, moment, in, any, segment, of, the, arch, is, much, smaller, than, in, a, beam, with, the, equivalent, load, and, span, the, diagram, on, the, right, shows, the, difference, between, a, loaded, arch, and, a, beam, elements, of, the, arch, are, mostly, subject, to, compression, a, while, in, the, beam, a, bending, moment, is, present, with, compression, at, the, top, and, tension, at, the, bottom, b, in, the, past, when, arches, were, made, of, masonry, pieces, the, horizontal, forces, at, the, ends, of, an, arch, caused, the, need, for, heavy, abutments, cf, roman, triumphal, arch, the, other, way, to, counteract, the, forces, and, thus, allow, thinner, supports, was, to, use, the, counter, arches, as, in, an, arcade, arrangement, where, the, horizontal, thrust, of, each, arch, is, counterbalanced, by, its, neighbors, and, only, the, end, arches, need, to, buttressed, with, new, construction, materials, steel, concrete, engineered, wood, not, only, the, arches, themselves, got, lighter, but, the, horizontal, thrust, can, be, further, relieved, by, a, tie, connecting, the, ends, of, an, arch, when, evaluated, from, the, perspective, of, an, amount, of, material, required, to, support, a, given, load, the, best, solid, structures, are, compression, only, with, the, flexible, materials, the, same, is, true, for, tension, only, designs, there, is, a, fundamental, symmetry, in, nature, between, solid, compression, only, and, flexible, tension, only, arrangements, noticed, by, robert, hooke, in, 1676, as, hangs, the, flexible, line, so, but, inverted, will, stand, the, rigid, arch, thus, the, study, and, terminology, of, arch, shapes, is, inextricably, linked, to, the, study, of, hanging, chains, the, corresponding, curves, or, polygons, are, called, funicular, just, like, the, shape, of, a, hanging, chain, will, vary, depending, on, the, weights, attached, to, it, the, shape, of, an, ideal, compression, only, arch, will, depend, on, the, distribution, of, the, load, there, are, multiple, ways, to, classify, an, arch, a, sequence, of, arches, can, be, grouped, together, forming, an, arcade, romans, perfected, this, form, as, shown, for, example, by, arched, structures, of, pont, du, gard, in, the, interior, of, hall, churches, arcades, of, separating, arches, were, used, to, separate, the, nave, of, a, church, from, the, side, aisle, or, two, adjacent, side, aisles, two, tiered, arches, with, two, arches, superimposed, were, sometimes, used, in, islamic, architecture, mostly, for, decorative, purposes, an, opening, of, the, arch, can, be, filled, creating, a, blind, arch, blind, arches, are, frequently, decorative, and, were, extensively, used, in, early, christian, romanesque, and, islamic, architecture, alternatively, the, opening, can, be, filled, with, smaller, arches, producing, a, containing, arch, common, in, gothic, and, romanesque, architecture, multiple, arches, can, be, superimposed, with, an, offset, creating, an, interlaced, series, of, usually, with, some, exceptions, blind, and, decorative, arches, most, likely, of, islamic, origin, the, interlaced, arcades, were, popular, in, romanesque, and, gothic, architecture, rear, arch, also, rere, arch, is, the, one, that, frames, the, internal, side, of, an, opening, in, the, external, wall, structurally, relieving, arches, often, blind, or, containing, can, be, used, to, take, off, load, from, some, portions, of, the, building, for, example, to, allow, use, of, thinner, exterior, walls, with, larger, window, openings, or, as, in, the, roman, pantheon, to, redirect, the, weight, of, the, upper, structures, to, particular, strong, points, transverse, arches, introduced, in, carolingian, architecture, are, placed, across, the, nave, to, compartmentalize, together, with, longitudinal, separating, arches, the, internal, space, into, bays, and, support, vaults, a, diaphragm, arch, similarly, goes, in, the, transverse, direction, but, carries, a, section, of, wall, on, top, it, is, used, to, support, or, divide, sections, of, the, high, roof, strainer, arches, were, built, as, an, afterthought, to, prevent, two, adjacent, supports, from, imploding, due, to, miscalculation, frequently, they, were, made, very, decorative, with, one, of, the, best, examples, provided, by, the, wells, cathedral, strainer, arches, can, be, inverted, upside, down, while, remaining, structural, when, used, across, railway, cuttings, to, prevent, collapse, of, the, walls, strainer, arches, may, be, referred, to, as, flying, arches, a, counter, arch, is, built, adjacent, to, another, arch, to, oppose, its, horizontal, action, or, help, to, stabilize, it, for, example, when, constructing, a, flying, buttress, the, large, variety, of, arch, shapes, left, can, mostly, be, classified, into, three, broad, categories, rounded, pointed, and, parabolic, round, semicircular, arches, were, commonly, used, for, ancient, arches, that, were, constructed, of, heavy, masonry, and, were, relied, heavily, on, by, the, roman, builders, since, the, 4th, century, bc, it, is, considered, to, be, the, most, common, arch, form, characteristic, for, roman, romanesque, and, renaissance, architecture, a, segmental, arch, with, a, rounded, shape, that, is, less, than, a, semicircle, is, very, old, the, versions, were, cut, in, the, rock, in, ancient, egypt, c, 2100, bc, at, beni, hasan, since, then, it, was, occasionally, used, in, greek, temples, utilized, in, roman, residential, construction, islamic, architecture, and, got, popular, as, window, pediments, during, the, renaissance, a, basket, handle, arch, also, known, as, depressed, arch, three, centred, arch, basket, arch, consists, of, segments, of, three, circles, with, origins, at, three, different, centers, sometimes, uses, five, or, seven, segments, so, can, also, be, five, centred, etc, was, used, in, late, gothic, and, baroque, architecture, a, horseshoe, arch, also, known, as, keyhole, arch, has, a, rounded, shape, that, includes, more, than, a, semicircle, is, associated, with, islamic, architecture, and, was, known, in, areas, of, europe, with, islamic, influence, spain, southern, france, italy, occasionally, used, in, gothics, it, briefly, enjoyed, popularity, as, the, entrance, door, treatment, in, the, interwar, england, a, pointed, arch, consists, of, two, two, centred, arch, or, more, circle, segments, culminating, in, a, point, at, the, top, it, originated, in, the, islamic, architecture, arrived, in, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, 11th, century, cluny, abbey, and, later, became, prominent, in, the, gothic, architecture, the, advantages, of, a, pointed, arch, over, a, semicircular, one, are, flexible, ratio, of, span, to, rise, and, lower, horizontal, reaction, at, the, base, this, innovation, allowed, for, taller, and, more, closely, spaced, openings, which, are, typical, of, gothic, architecture, equilateral, arch, is, the, most, common, form, of, the, pointed, arch, with, the, centers, of, two, circles, forming, the, intrados, coinciding, with, the, springing, points, of, the, opposite, segment, together, with, the, apex, point, they, form, a, equilateral, triangle, thus, the, name, if, the, centers, of, circles, are, farther, apart, the, arch, becomes, a, narrower, and, sharper, lancet, arch, that, appeared, in, france, in, the, early, gothic, architecture, saint, denis, abbey, and, became, prominent, in, england, in, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, salisbury, cathedral, if, the, centers, are, closer, to, another, the, result, is, a, wider, blunt, arch, the, intrados, of, the, cusped, arch, also, known, as, multifoil, arch, polyfoil, arch, polylobed, arch, and, scalloped, arch, includes, several, independent, circle, segments, in, a, scalloped, arrangement, these, primarily, decorative, arches, are, common, in, islamic, architecture, and, northern, european, late, gothic, can, be, found, in, romanesque, architecture, a, similar, trefoil, arch, includes, only, three, segments, and, sometimes, has, a, rounded, not, pointed, top, common, in, islamic, architecture, and, romanesque, buildings, influenced, by, it, it, later, became, popular, in, the, decorative, motifs, of, the, late, gothic, designs, of, northern, europe, each, arc, of, an, ogee, arch, consists, of, at, least, two, circle, segments, for, a, total, of, at, least, four, with, the, center, of, an, upper, circle, being, outside, the, extrados, after, european, appearance, in, the, 13th, century, on, the, facade, of, the, st, mark, s, basilica, the, arch, became, a, fixture, of, the, english, decorated, style, french, flamboyant, venetian, and, other, late, gothic, styles, ogee, arch, is, also, known, as, reversed, curve, arch, occasionally, also, called, an, inverted, arch, the, top, of, an, ogee, arch, sometimes, projects, beyond, the, wall, forming, the, so, called, nodding, ogee, popular, in, 14th, century, england, pulpitum, in, southwell, minster, each, arc, of, a, four, centred, arch, is, made, of, two, circle, segments, with, distinct, centers, usually, the, radius, used, closer, to, the, springing, point, is, smaller, with, a, more, pronounced, curvature, common, in, islamic, architecture, persian, arch, and, with, upper, portion, flattened, almost, to, straight, lines, tudor, arch, in, the, english, perpendicular, gothic, a, keel, arch, is, a, variant, of, four, centred, arch, with, haunches, almost, straight, resembling, a, section, view, of, a, capsized, ship, popular, in, islamic, architecture, it, can, be, also, found, in, europe, occasionally, with, a, small, ogee, element, at, the, top, so, it, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, a, variation, of, an, ogee, arch, curtain, arch, also, known, as, inflexed, arch, and, like, the, keel, arch, usually, decorative, uses, two, or, more, drooping, curves, that, join, at, the, apex, utilized, as, a, dressing, for, windows, and, doors, primarily, in, saxony, in, the, late, gothic, and, early, renaissance, buildings, late, 15th, to, early, 16th, century, associated, with, arnold, von, westfalen, when, the, intrados, has, multiple, concave, segments, the, arch, is, also, called, a, draped, arch, or, tented, arch, a, similar, arch, that, uses, a, mixture, of, curved, and, straight, segments, or, exhibits, sharp, turns, between, segments, is, a, mixed, line, arch, the, popularity, of, the, arches, using, segments, of, a, circle, is, due, to, simplicity, of, layout, and, construction, not, their, structural, properties, consequently, the, architects, historically, used, a, variety, of, other, curves, in, their, designs, elliptical, curves, hyperbolic, cosine, curves, including, catenary, and, parabolic, curves, there, are, two, reasons, behind, the, selection, of, these, curves, the, hyperbolic, curve, is, not, easy, to, trace, but, there, are, known, cases, of, its, use, the, non, circumferential, curves, look, similar, and, match, at, shallow, profiles, so, a, catenary, is, often, misclassified, as, a, parabola, per, galileo, the, chain, fits, its, parabola, almost, perfectly, gonz, lez, et, al, provide, an, example, of, palau, g, ell, where, researchers, do, not, agree, on, classification, of, the, arches, or, claim, the, prominence, of, parabolic, arches, while, the, measurements, show, that, just, two, of, the, 23, arches, designed, by, gaudi, are, actually, parabolic, three, parabolic, looking, curves, in, particular, are, of, significance, to, the, arch, design, parabola, itself, catenary, and, weighted, catenary, the, arches, naturally, use, the, inverted, upside, down, versions, of, these, curves, a, parabola, represents, an, ideal, all, compression, shape, when, the, load, is, equally, distributed, along, the, span, while, the, weight, of, the, arch, itself, is, negligible, a, catenary, is, the, best, solution, for, the, case, where, an, arch, with, uniform, thickness, carries, just, its, own, weight, with, no, external, load, the, practical, designs, for, bridges, are, somewhere, in, between, and, thus, use, the, curves, that, represent, a, compromise, that, combines, both, the, catenary, and, the, funicular, curve, for, particular, non, uniform, distribution, of, load, the, practical, free, standing, arches, are, stronger, and, thus, heavier, at, the, bottom, so, a, weighted, catenary, curve, is, utilized, for, them, the, same, curve, also, fits, well, an, application, where, a, bridge, consists, of, an, arch, with, a, roadway, of, packed, dirt, above, it, as, the, dead, load, increases, with, a, distance, from, the, center, unlike, regular, arches, the, flat, arch, also, known, as, jack, arch, lintel, arch, straight, arch, plate, bande, is, not, curved, instead, the, arch, is, flat, in, profile, and, can, be, used, under, the, same, circumstances, as, lintel, however, lintels, are, subject, to, bending, stress, while, the, flat, arches, are, true, arches, composed, of, irregular, voussoir, shapes, the, keystone, is, the, only, one, of, the, symmetric, wedge, shape, and, that, efficiently, uses, the, compressive, strength, of, the, masonry, in, the, same, manner, as, a, curved, arch, and, thus, requires, a, mass, of, masonry, on, both, sides, to, absorb, the, considerable, lateral, thrust, used, in, the, roman, architecture, to, imitate, the, greek, lintels, islamic, architecture, european, medieval, and, renaissance, architecture, the, flat, arch, is, still, being, used, as, a, decorative, pattern, primarily, at, the, top, of, window, openings, the, corbel, also, corbelled, arch, made, of, two, corbels, meeting, in, the, middle, of, the, span, is, a, true, arch, in, a, sense, of, being, able, to, carry, a, load, but, it, is, false, in, a, structural, sense, as, its, components, are, subject, to, bending, stress, the, typical, profile, is, not, curved, but, has, triangular, shape, invented, prior, to, the, semicircular, arch, the, corbel, arch, was, used, already, in, the, egyptian, and, mycenaean, architecture, in, the, 3rd, and, 2nd, millennium, bc, like, a, corbel, arch, the, triangular, arch, is, not, a, true, arch, in, a, structural, sense, its, intrados, is, formed, by, two, slabs, leaning, against, each, other, brick, builders, would, call, triangular, any, arch, with, straight, inclined, sides, the, design, was, common, in, anglo, saxon, england, until, the, late, 11th, century, st, mary, goslany, mayan, corbel, arches, are, sometimes, called, triangular, due, to, their, shape, few, transformations, can, be, applied, to, arch, shapes, if, one, impost, is, much, higher, than, another, the, arch, frequently, pointed, is, known, as, ramping, arch, raking, arch, or, rampant, arch, from, french, arc, rampant, originally, used, to, support, inclined, structures, like, staircases, in, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, their, appeared, as, parts, of, flying, buttresses, used, to, counteract, the, thrust, of, gothic, ribbed, vaults, a, central, part, of, an, arch, can, be, raised, on, short, vertical, supports, creating, a, trefoil, like, shouldered, arch, the, raised, central, part, can, vary, all, the, way, from, a, flat, arch, to, ogee, the, shouldered, arches, were, used, to, decorate, openings, in, europe, from, medieval, times, to, late, gothic, architecture, became, common, in, iranian, architecture, from, the, 14th, century, and, were, later, adopted, in, the, ottoman, turkey, in, a, stilted, arch, also, surmounted, the, springing, line, is, located, above, the, imposts, on, stilts, known, to, islamic, architects, by, the, 8th, century, the, technique, was, utilized, to, vertically, align, the, apexes, of, arches, of, different, dimensions, in, romanesque, and, gothic, architecture, stilting, was, useful, for, semicircular, arches, where, the, ratio, of, the, rise, fixed, at, 1, 2, of, the, span, but, was, applied, to, the, pointed, arches, too, the, skew, arch, also, known, as, an, oblique, arch, is, used, when, the, arch, needs, to, turn, in, the, horizontal, plane, for, example, when, a, bridge, crosses, the, river, at, an, angle, different, than, 90, a, splayed, arch, is, used, for, the, case, of, unequal, spans, on, the, sides, of, the, arch, when, for, example, an, interior, opening, in, the, wall, is, larger, than, the, exterior, one, the, intrados, of, a, round, splayed, arch, is, not, cylindrical, but, has, a, conical, shape, a, wide, arch, with, its, rise, less, than, 1, 2, of, the, span, and, thus, the, geometric, circle, of, at, least, one, segment, is, below, the, springing, line, is, called, a, surbased, arch, sometimes, also, a, depressed, arch, a, drop, arch, is, either, a, basket, handle, arch, or, a, blunt, arch, the, practical, arch, bridges, are, built, either, as, a, fixed, arch, a, two, hinged, arch, or, a, three, hinged, arch, the, fixed, arch, is, most, often, used, in, reinforced, concrete, bridges, and, tunnels, which, have, short, spans, because, it, is, subject, to, additional, internal, stress, from, thermal, expansion, and, contraction, this, kind, of, arch, is, statically, indeterminate, the, internal, state, is, impossible, to, determine, based, on, the, external, forces, alone, the, two, hinged, arch, is, most, often, used, to, bridge, long, spans, this, kind, of, arch, has, pinned, connections, at, its, base, unlike, that, of, the, fixed, arch, the, pinned, base, can, rotate, thus, allowing, the, structure, to, move, freely, and, compensate, for, the, thermal, expansion, and, contraction, that, changes, in, outdoor, temperature, cause, however, this, can, result, in, additional, stresses, and, therefore, the, two, hinged, arch, is, also, statically, indeterminate, although, not, as, much, as, the, fixed, arch, the, three, hinged, arch, is, not, only, hinged, at, its, base, like, the, two, hinged, arch, yet, also, at, its, apex, the, additional, apical, connection, allows, the, three, hinged, arch, to, move, in, two, opposite, directions, and, compensate, for, any, expansion, and, contraction, this, kind, of, arch, is, thus, not, subject, to, additional, stress, from, thermal, change, unlike, the, other, two, kinds, of, arch, the, three, hinged, arch, is, therefore, statically, determinate, it, is, most, often, used, for, spans, of, medial, length, such, as, those, of, roofs, of, large, buildings, another, advantage, of, the, three, hinged, arch, is, that, the, reaction, of, the, pinned, bases, is, more, predictable, than, the, one, for, the, fixed, arch, allowing, shallow, bearing, type, foundations, in, spans, of, medial, length, in, the, three, hinged, arch, thermal, expansion, and, contraction, of, the, arch, will, cause, vertical, movements, at, the, peak, pin, joint, but, will, have, no, appreciable, effect, on, the, bases, which, further, simplifies, foundational, design, the, arch, became, popular, in, the, roman, times, and, mostly, spread, alongside, the, european, influence, although, it, was, known, and, occasionally, used, much, earlier, many, ancient, architectures, avoided, the, use, of, arches, including, the, viking, and, hindu, ones, true, arches, as, opposed, to, corbel, arches, were, known, by, a, number, of, civilizations, in, the, ancient, near, east, including, the, levant, but, their, use, was, infrequent, and, mostly, confined, to, underground, structures, such, as, drains, where, the, problem, of, lateral, thrust, is, greatly, diminished, an, example, of, the, latter, would, be, the, nippur, arch, built, before, 3800, bc, and, dated, by, h, v, hilprecht, 1859, 1925, to, even, before, 4000, bc, rare, exceptions, are, an, arched, mudbrick, home, doorway, dated, to, c, 2000, bc, from, tell, taya, in, iraq, and, two, bronze, age, arched, canaanite, city, gates, one, at, ashkelon, dated, to, c, 1850, bc, and, one, at, tel, dan, dated, to, c, 1750, bc, both, in, modern, day, israel, an, elamite, tomb, dated, 1500, bc, from, haft, teppe, contains, a, parabolic, vault, which, is, considered, one, of, the, earliest, evidences, of, arches, in, iran, the, use, of, true, arches, in, egypt, also, originated, in, the, 4th, millennium, bc, underground, barrel, vaults, at, the, dendera, cemetery, standing, arches, were, known, since, at, least, the, third, dynasty, but, very, few, examples, survived, since, the, arches, were, mostly, used, in, non, durable, secular, buildings, and, made, of, mud, brick, voussoirs, that, were, not, wedge, shaped, but, simply, held, in, place, by, mortar, and, thus, susceptible, to, a, collapse, the, oldest, arch, still, standing, is, at, ramesseum, sacred, buildings, exhibited, either, lintel, design, or, corbelled, arches, arches, were, mostly, missing, in, egypt, temples, even, after, the, roman, conquest, even, though, egyptians, thought, of, the, arch, as, a, spiritual, shape, and, used, it, in, the, rock, cut, tombs, and, portable, shrines, auguste, mariette, suggested, that, this, choice, was, based, on, a, relative, fragility, of, a, vault, what, would, remain, of, the, tombs, and, temples, of, egyptians, today, if, they, had, preferred, the, vault, mycenaean, architecture, utilized, only, the, corbel, arches, in, their, beehive, tombs, with, triangular, openings, mycenaeans, had, also, built, probably, the, oldest, still, standing, stone, arch, bridge, in, the, world, arkadiko, bridge, in, greece, as, evidenced, by, their, imitations, of, the, parabolic, arches, hittites, most, likely, were, exposed, to, the, egyptian, designs, but, used, the, corbelled, technique, to, build, them, the, assyrians, also, apparently, under, the, egyptian, influence, adopted, the, true, arch, with, a, slightly, pointed, profile, early, in, the, 8th, century, in, ancient, persia, the, achaemenid, empire, 550, bc, 330, bc, built, small, barrel, vaults, essentially, a, series, of, arches, built, together, to, form, a, hall, known, as, iwan, which, became, massive, monumental, structures, during, the, later, parthian, empire, 247, bc, ad, 224, this, architectural, tradition, was, continued, by, the, sasanian, empire, 224, 651, which, built, the, taq, kasra, at, ctesiphon, in, the, 6th, century, ad, the, largest, free, standing, vault, until, modern, times, an, early, european, example, of, a, voussoir, arch, appears, in, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, rhodes, footbridge, proto, true, arches, can, also, be, found, under, the, stairs, of, the, temple, of, apollo, at, didyma, and, the, stadium, at, olympia, the, ancient, romans, learned, the, semicircular, arch, from, the, etruscans, both, cultures, apparently, adopted, the, design, in, the, 4th, century, bc, refined, it, and, were, the, first, builders, in, europe, to, tap, its, full, potential, for, above, ground, buildings, the, romans, were, the, first, builders, in, europe, perhaps, the, first, in, the, world, to, fully, appreciate, the, advantages, of, the, arch, the, vault, and, the, dome, throughout, the, roman, empire, from, syria, to, scotland, engineers, erected, arch, structures, the, first, use, of, arches, was, for, civic, structures, like, drains, and, city, gates, later, the, arches, were, utilized, for, major, civic, buildings, bridges, and, aqueducts, with, the, outstanding, 1st, century, ad, examples, provided, by, the, colosseum, pont, du, gard, and, the, aqueduct, of, segovia, the, introduction, of, the, ceremonial, triumphal, arch, dates, back, to, roman, republic, although, the, best, examples, are, from, the, imperial, times, arch, of, augustus, at, susa, arch, of, titus, romans, initially, avoided, using, the, arch, in, the, religious, buildings, and, in, rome, arched, temples, were, quite, rare, until, the, recognition, of, christianity, in, 313, ad, with, the, exceptions, provided, by, the, pantheon, and, the, temple, of, minerva, medica, away, from, the, capital, arched, temples, were, more, common, temple, of, hadrian, at, ephesus, temple, of, jupiter, at, sbeitla, severan, temple, at, djemila, arrival, of, christianity, prompted, creation, of, the, new, type, of, temple, a, christian, basilica, that, made, a, thorough, break, with, the, pagan, tradition, with, arches, as, one, of, the, main, elements, of, the, design, along, with, the, exposed, brick, walls, santa, sabina, in, rome, sant, apollinare, in, classe, for, a, long, period, from, the, late, 5th, century, to, the, 20th, century, arcades, were, a, standard, staple, for, the, western, christian, architecture, vaults, began, to, be, used, for, roofing, large, interior, spaces, such, as, halls, and, temples, a, function, that, was, also, assumed, by, domed, structures, from, the, 1st, century, bc, onwards, the, segmental, arch, was, first, built, by, the, romans, who, realized, that, an, arch, in, a, bridge, did, not, have, to, be, a, semicircle, such, as, in, alcon, tar, bridge, or, ponte, san, lorenzo, the, utilitarian, and, mass, residential, insulae, buildings, as, found, in, ostia, antica, and, pompeii, mostly, used, low, segmental, arches, made, of, bricks, and, architraves, made, of, wood, while, the, concrete, lintel, arches, can, be, found, in, villas, and, palaces, ancient, architecture, of, china, and, japan, used, mostly, timber, framed, construction, and, trabeated, system, arches, were, little, used, although, there, are, few, arch, bridges, known, from, literature, and, one, artistic, depiction, in, stone, carved, relief, since, the, only, surviving, artefacts, of, architecture, from, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, are, rammed, earth, defensive, walls, and, towers, ceramic, roof, tiles, from, no, longer, existent, wooden, buildings, stone, gate, towers, and, underground, brick, tombs, the, known, vaults, domes, and, archways, were, built, with, the, support, of, the, earth, and, were, not, free, standing, china, s, oldest, surviving, stone, arch, bridge, is, the, anji, bridge, still, in, use, it, was, built, between, 595, ce, and, 605, ce, during, the, sui, dynasty, islamic, architects, adopted, the, roman, arches, but, had, quickly, shown, their, resourcefulness, by, the, 8th, century, the, simple, semicircular, arch, was, almost, entirely, replaced, with, fancier, shapes, few, fine, examples, of, the, former, in, the, umayyad, architecture, notwithstanding, cf, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, 706, 715, ce, the, first, pointed, arches, appear, already, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, ad, al, aqsa, mosque, palace, of, ukhaidhir, cisterns, at, the, white, mosque, of, ramle, their, variations, spread, fast, and, wide, mosque, of, ibn, tulun, in, cairo, 876, 879, ad, nizamiyya, madrasa, at, khar, gerd, now, iran, 11th, century, kongo, mosque, in, diani, beach, kenya, 16th, century, islamic, architecture, brought, to, life, a, large, amount, of, arch, forms, the, round, horseshoe, arch, that, became, a, characteristic, trait, of, the, islamic, buildings, the, keel, arch, the, cusped, arch, and, the, mixed, line, arch, where, the, curved, ogee, swell, is, interspersed, with, abrupt, bends, the, great, mosque, of, cordoba, that, can, be, considered, a, catalogue, of, islamic, arches, contains, also, the, arches, with, almost, straight, sides, trefoil, interlaced, and, joggled, mosque, of, ibn, tulun, adds, four, centred, and, stilted, version, of, the, pointed, arch, it, is, quite, likely, that, the, appearance, of, the, pointed, arch, an, essential, element, of, the, gothic, style, in, europe, monte, cassino, 1066, 1071, ad, and, the, cluny, abbey, five, years, later, and, the, ogee, arch, in, venice, c, 1250, is, a, result, of, the, islamic, influence, possibly, through, sicily, saoud, also, credits, to, islamic, architects, the, spread, of, the, transverse, arch, mixed, line, arch, became, popular, in, the, mud, jar, style, and, subsequently, spread, around, the, spanish, speaking, world, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, left, the, church, as, the, only, client, of, major, construction, with, all, pre, romanesque, architectural, styles, borrowing, from, roman, construction, with, its, semicircular, arch, due, to, the, decline, in, the, construction, quality, the, walls, were, thicker, and, the, arches, thus, heavier, than, their, roman, prototypes, eventually, the, architects, started, to, use, the, depth, of, the, arches, for, decoration, turning, the, deep, opening, into, an, arch, order, or, rebated, arch, a, sequence, of, progressively, smaller, concentric, arches, each, inset, with, a, rebate, romanesque, style, started, experiments, with, the, pointed, arch, late, in, the, 11th, century, cluny, abbey, in, few, decades, the, practice, spread, durham, cathedral, basilica, of, saint, denis, early, gothic, utilized, the, flexibility, of, the, pointed, arch, by, grouping, together, arches, of, different, spans, but, with, the, same, height, while, the, arches, used, in, the, mediaeval, europe, were, borrowed, from, the, roman, and, islamic, architecture, the, use, of, pointed, arch, to, form, the, rib, vault, was, novel, and, became, the, defining, characteristic, of, gothic, construction, at, about, 1400, ad, the, city, states, of, italy, where, the, pointed, arch, had, never, gotten, much, traction, initiated, the, revival, of, the, roman, style, with, its, round, arches, renaissance, by, the, 16th, century, the, new, style, spread, across, europe, and, through, the, influence, of, empires, to, the, rest, of, the, world, arch, became, a, dominant, architectural, form, until, the, introduction, of, the, new, construction, materials, like, steel, and, concrete, the, history, of, arch, in, india, is, very, long, some, arches, were, apparently, found, in, excavations, of, kosambi, 2nd, millennium, bc, however, the, continuous, history, begins, with, rock, cut, arches, in, the, lomas, rishi, cave, 3rd, century, bc, vaulted, roof, of, an, early, harappan, burial, chamber, has, been, noted, at, rakhigarhi, s, r, rao, reports, vaulted, roof, of, a, small, chamber, in, a, house, from, lothal, barrel, vaults, were, also, used, in, the, late, harappan, cemetery, h, culture, dated, 1900, bc, 1300, bc, which, formed, the, roof, of, the, metal, working, furnace, the, discovery, was, made, by, vats, in, 1940, during, excavation, at, harappa, the, use, of, arches, until, the, islamic, conquest, of, india, in, the, 12th, century, ad, was, sporadic, with, ogee, arches, and, barrel, vaults, in, rock, cut, temples, karla, caves, from, the, 1st, century, bc, and, decorative, pointed, gavaksha, arches, by, the, 5th, century, ad, voussoir, vaults, were, used, structurally, in, the, brick, construction, surviving, examples, include, the, temple, at, bhitargaon, 5th, century, ad, and, mahabodhi, temple, 7th, century, ad, the, latter, has, both, pointed, arches, and, semicircular, arches, these, gupta, era, arch, vault, system, was, later, used, extensively, in, burmese, buddhist, temples, in, pyu, and, bagan, in, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, with, the, arrival, of, islamic, and, other, western, asia, influence, the, arches, became, prominent, in, the, indian, architecture, although, the, post, and, lintel, construction, was, still, preferred, a, variety, of, pointed, and, lobed, arches, was, characteristic, for, the, indo, islamic, architecture, with, the, monumental, example, of, buland, darwaza, that, has, pointed, arch, decorated, with, small, cusped, arches, mayan, architecture, utilized, the, corbel, arches, the, other, mesoamerican, cultures, used, only, the, flat, roofs, with, no, arches, whatsoever, although, some, researchers, had, suggested, that, both, maya, and, aztec, architects, understood, the, concept, of, a, true, arch, the, 19th, century, introduction, of, the, wrought, iron, and, later, steel, into, construction, changed, the, role, of, the, arch, due, to, the, high, tensile, strength, of, new, materials, relatively, long, lintels, became, possible, as, was, demonstrated, by, the, tubular, britannia, bridge, robert, stephenson, 1846, 1850, a, fervent, proponent, of, the, trabeated, system, alexander, greek, thomson, whose, preference, for, lintels, was, originally, based, on, aesthetic, criteria, observed, that, the, spans, of, this, bridge, are, longer, than, that, of, any, arch, ever, built, thus, the, simple, unsophisticated, stone, lintel, contains, in, its, structure, all, the, scientific, appliances, used, in, the, great, tubular, bridge, stonehenge, is, more, scientifically, constructed, than, york, minster, use, of, arches, in, bridge, construction, continued, the, britannia, bridge, was, rebuilt, in, 1972, as, a, truss, arch, bridge, yet, the, steel, frames, and, reinforced, concrete, frames, mostly, replaced, the, arches, as, the, load, bearing, elements, in, buildings, as, a, pure, compression, form, the, utility, of, the, arch, is, due, to, many, building, materials, including, stone, and, unreinforced, concrete, being, strong, under, compression, but, brittle, when, tensile, stress, is, applied, to, them, the, voussoirs, can, be, wedge, shaped, or, have, a, form, of, a, rectangular, cuboid, in, the, latter, case, the, wedge, like, shape, is, provided, by, the, mortar, an, arch, is, held, in, place, by, the, weight, of, all, of, its, members, making, construction, problematic, one, answer, is, to, build, a, frame, historically, of, wood, which, exactly, follows, the, form, of, the, underside, of, the, arch, this, is, known, as, a, centre, or, centring, voussoirs, are, laid, on, it, until, the, arch, is, complete, and, self, supporting, for, an, arch, higher, than, head, height, scaffolding, would, be, required, so, it, could, be, combined, with, the, arch, support, arches, may, fall, when, the, frame, is, removed, if, design, or, construction, has, been, faulty, old, arches, sometimes, need, reinforcement, due, to, decay, of, the, keystones, forming, what, is, known, as, bald, arch, in, reinforced, concrete, construction, the, principle, of, the, arch, is, used, so, as, to, benefit, from, the, concrete, s, strength, in, resisting, compressive, stress, where, any, other, form, of, stress, is, raised, such, as, tensile, or, torsional, stress, it, has, to, be, resisted, by, carefully, placed, reinforcement, rods, or, fibres, the, type, of, arches, or, absence, of, them, is, one, of, the, most, prominent, characteristics, of, an, architectural, style, for, example, when, heinrich, h, bsch, in, the, 19th, century, tried, to, classify, the, architectural, style, his, primary, elements, were, roof, and, supports, with, the, top, level, basic, types, trabeated, no, arches, and, arcuated, arch, based, his, next, division, for, the, arcuated, styles, was, based, on, the, use, of, round, and, pointed, arch, shapes, the, steady, horizontal, push, of, an, arch, against, the, abutments, gave, rise, to, a, saying, the, arch, never, sleeps, attributed, to, many, sources, from, hindu, to, arabs, this, adage, stresses, that, the, arch, carries, a, seed, of, death, for, itself, and, the, structure, containing, it, a, statement, that, can, be, made, upon, observation, of, the, roman, ruins, the, plot, of, the, nebuly, coat, by, j, meade, falkner, inspired, by, a, collapse, of, a, tower, at, the, chichester, cathedral, plays, with, the, idea, while, dealing, with, the, slow, disintegration, of, a, church, building, saoud, explains, the, proverb, by, chain, like, self, balancing, of, the, horizontal, and, vertical, forces, in, the, arch, and, its, universal, adaptability
