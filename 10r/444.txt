a, postage, stamp, is, a, small, piece, of, paper, issued, by, a, post, office, postal, administration, or, other, authorized, vendors, to, customers, who, pay, postage, the, cost, involved, in, moving, insuring, or, registering, mail, then, the, stamp, is, affixed, to, the, face, or, address, side, of, any, item, of, mail, an, envelope, or, other, postal, cover, e, g, packet, box, mailing, cylinder, which, they, wish, to, send, the, item, is, then, processed, by, the, postal, system, where, a, postmark, or, cancellation, mark, in, modern, usage, indicating, date, and, point, of, origin, of, mailing, is, applied, to, the, stamp, and, its, left, and, right, sides, to, prevent, its, reuse, next, the, item, is, delivered, to, its, addressee, always, featuring, the, name, of, the, issuing, nation, with, the, exception, of, the, united, kingdom, a, denomination, of, its, value, and, often, an, illustration, of, persons, events, institutions, or, natural, realities, that, symbolize, the, nation, s, traditions, and, values, every, stamp, is, printed, on, a, piece, of, usually, rectangular, but, sometimes, triangular, or, otherwise, shaped, special, custom, made, paper, whose, back, is, either, glazed, with, an, adhesive, gum, or, self, adhesive, because, governments, issue, stamps, of, different, denominations, in, unequal, numbers, and, routinely, discontinue, some, lines, and, introduce, others, and, because, of, their, illustrations, and, association, with, the, social, and, political, realities, of, the, time, of, their, issue, they, are, often, prized, for, their, beauty, and, historical, significance, by, stamp, collectors, whose, study, of, their, history, and, of, mailing, systems, is, called, philately, because, collectors, often, buy, stamps, from, an, issuing, agency, with, no, intention, to, use, them, for, postage, the, revenues, from, such, purchases, and, payments, of, postage, can, make, them, a, source, of, net, profit, to, that, agency, on, 1, may, 1840, the, penny, black, the, first, adhesive, postage, stamp, was, issued, in, the, united, kingdom, within, three, years, postage, stamps, were, introduced, in, switzerland, and, brazil, a, little, later, in, the, united, states, and, by, 1860, they, were, in, 90, countries, around, the, world, the, first, postage, stamps, did, not, need, to, show, the, issuing, country, so, no, country, name, was, included, on, them, thus, the, united, kingdom, remains, the, only, country, in, the, world, to, omit, its, name, on, postage, stamps, the, monarch, s, image, signifies, the, united, kingdom, as, the, country, of, origin, throughout, modern, history, numerous, methods, were, used, to, indicate, that, postage, had, been, paid, on, a, mailed, item, so, several, different, men, have, received, credit, for, inventing, the, postage, stamp, in, 1680, william, dockwra, an, english, merchant, in, london, and, his, partner, robert, murray, established, the, london, penny, post, the, lpp, was, a, mail, system, that, delivered, letters, and, small, parcels, inside, the, city, of, london, for, the, sum, of, one, penny, confirmation, of, paid, postage, was, indicated, by, the, use, of, a, hand, stamp, to, frank, the, mailed, item, though, this, stamp, was, applied, to, the, letter, or, parcel, itself, rather, than, to, a, separate, piece, of, paper, it, is, considered, by, many, historians, to, be, the, world, s, first, postage, stamp, in, 1835, the, civil, servant, lovrenc, ko, ir, from, ljubljana, in, austria, hungary, now, slovenia, suggested, the, use, of, artificially, affixed, postal, tax, stamps, using, gepresste, papieroblate, pressed, paper, wafers, but, although, civil, bureaucrats, considered, the, suggestion, in, detail, it, was, not, adopted, the, papieroblate, were, to, produce, stamps, as, paper, decals, so, thin, as, to, prevent, their, reuse, in, 1836, robert, wallace, a, member, of, british, parliament, gave, sir, rowland, hill, numerous, books, and, documents, about, the, postal, service, which, hill, described, as, a, half, hundred, weight, of, material, after, a, detailed, study, on, 4, january, 1837, hill, submitted, a, pamphlet, entitled, post, office, reform, its, importance, and, practicability, to, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, thomas, spring, rice, which, was, marked, private, and, confidential, and, not, released, to, the, general, public, the, chancellor, summoned, hill, to, a, meeting, at, which, he, suggested, improvements, and, changes, to, be, presented, in, a, supplement, which, hill, duly, produced, and, submitted, on, 28, january, 1837, summoned, to, give, evidence, before, the, commission, for, post, office, enquiry, on, 13, february, 1837, hill, read, from, the, letter, he, wrote, to, the, chancellor, that, included, a, statement, saying, that, the, notation, of, paid, postage, could, be, created, by, using, a, bit, of, paper, just, large, enough, to, bear, the, stamp, and, covered, at, the, back, with, a, glutinous, wash, this, would, eventually, become, the, first, unambiguous, description, of, a, modern, adhesive, postage, stamp, though, the, term, postage, stamp, originated, at, later, date, shortly, afterward, hill, s, revision, of, the, booklet, dated, 22, february, 1837, containing, some, 28, 000, words, incorporating, the, supplement, given, to, the, chancellor, and, statements, he, made, to, the, commission, was, published, and, made, available, to, the, general, public, hansard, records, that, on, 15, december, 1837, benjamin, hawes, asked, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, whether, it, was, the, intention, of, the, government, to, give, effect, to, the, recommendation, of, the, commissioners, of, the, post, office, contained, in, their, ninth, report, relating, to, the, reduction, of, the, rates, of, postage, and, the, issuing, of, penny, stamps, hill, s, ideas, for, postage, stamps, and, charging, paid, postage, based, on, weight, soon, took, hold, and, were, adopted, in, many, countries, throughout, the, world, with, the, new, policy, of, charging, by, weight, using, envelopes, for, mailing, documents, became, the, norm, hill, s, brother, edwin, invented, a, prototype, envelope, making, machine, that, folded, paper, into, envelopes, quickly, enough, to, match, the, pace, of, the, growing, demand, for, postage, stamps, rowland, hill, and, the, reforms, he, introduced, to, the, united, kingdom, postal, system, appear, on, several, of, its, commemorative, stamps, in, the, 1881, book, the, penny, postage, scheme, of, 1837, scotsman, patrick, chalmers, claimed, that, his, father, james, chalmers, published, an, essay, in, august, 1834, describing, and, advocating, a, postage, stamp, but, submitted, no, evidence, of, the, essay, s, existence, nevertheless, until, he, died, in, 1891, patrick, chalmers, campaigned, to, have, his, father, recognized, as, the, inventor, of, the, postage, stamp, the, first, independent, evidence, for, chalmers, claim, is, an, essay, dated, 8, february, 1838, and, received, by, the, post, office, on, 17, february, 1838, in, which, he, proposed, adhesive, postage, stamps, to, the, general, post, office, in, this, approximately, 800, word, document, concerning, methods, of, indicating, that, postage, had, been, paid, on, mail, he, states, chalmers, original, document, is, now, in, the, united, kingdom, s, national, postal, museum, since, chalmers, used, the, same, postage, denominations, that, hill, had, proposed, in, february, 1837, it, is, clear, that, he, was, aware, of, hill, s, proposals, but, whether, he, obtained, a, copy, of, hill, s, booklet, or, simply, read, about, it, in, one, or, both, of, the, two, detailed, accounts, 25, march, 1837, and, 20, december, 1837, published, in, the, times, is, unknown, neither, article, mentioned, a, bit, of, paper, just, large, enough, to, bear, the, stamp, so, chalmers, could, not, have, known, that, hill, had, made, such, a, proposal, this, suggests, that, either, chalmers, had, previously, read, hill, s, booklet, and, was, merely, elaborating, hill, s, idea, or, he, had, independently, developed, the, idea, of, the, modern, postage, stamp, james, chalmers, organized, petitions, for, a, low, and, uniform, rate, of, postage, the, first, such, petition, was, presented, in, the, house, of, commons, on, 4, december, 1837, from, montrose, further, petitions, which, he, organized, were, presented, on, 1, may, 1838, from, dunbar, and, cupar, 14, may, 1838, from, the, county, of, forfar, and, 12, june, 1839, at, this, same, time, other, groups, organized, petitions, and, presented, them, to, parliament, all, petitions, for, consumer, oriented, low, cost, volume, based, postal, rates, followed, publication, of, hill, s, proposals, other, claimants, include, or, have, included, postage, stamps, have, facilitated, the, delivery, of, mail, since, the, 1840s, before, then, ink, and, hand, stamps, hence, the, word, stamp, usually, made, from, wood, or, cork, were, often, used, to, frank, the, mail, and, confirm, the, payment, of, postage, the, first, adhesive, postage, stamp, commonly, referred, to, as, the, penny, black, was, issued, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1840, the, invention, of, the, stamp, was, part, of, an, attempt, to, improve, the, postal, system, in, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, which, in, the, early, 19th, century, was, in, disarray, and, rife, with, corruption, there, are, varying, accounts, of, the, inventor, or, inventors, of, the, stamp, before, the, introduction, of, postage, stamps, mail, in, the, united, kingdom, was, paid, for, by, the, recipient, a, system, that, was, associated, with, an, irresolvable, problem, the, costs, of, delivering, mail, were, not, recoverable, by, the, postal, service, when, recipients, were, unable, or, unwilling, to, pay, for, delivered, items, and, senders, had, no, incentive, to, restrict, the, number, size, or, weight, of, items, sent, whether, or, not, they, would, ultimately, be, paid, for, the, postage, stamp, resolved, this, issue, in, a, simple, and, elegant, manner, with, the, additional, benefit, of, room, for, an, element, of, beauty, to, be, introduced, concurrently, with, the, first, stamps, the, united, kingdom, offered, wrappers, for, mail, later, related, inventions, include, postal, stationery, such, as, prepaid, postage, envelopes, post, cards, lettercards, aerogrammes, and, postage, meters, the, postage, stamp, afforded, convenience, for, both, the, mailer, and, postal, officials, more, effectively, recovered, costs, for, the, postal, service, and, ultimately, resulted, in, a, better, faster, postal, system, with, the, conveniences, stamps, offered, their, use, resulted, in, greatly, increased, mailings, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, postage, stamps, released, during, this, era, were, the, most, popular, way, of, paying, for, mail, however, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, were, rapidly, being, eclipsed, by, the, use, of, metered, postage, and, bulk, mailing, by, businesses, as, postage, stamps, with, their, engraved, imagery, began, to, appear, on, a, widespread, basis, historians, and, collectors, began, to, take, notice, the, study, of, postage, stamps, and, their, use, is, referred, to, as, philately, stamp, collecting, can, be, both, a, hobby, and, a, form, of, historical, study, and, reference, as, government, issued, postage, stamps, and, their, mailing, systems, have, always, been, involved, with, the, history, of, nations, although, a, number, of, people, laid, claim, to, the, concept, of, the, postage, stamp, it, is, well, documented, that, stamps, were, first, introduced, in, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, on, 1, may, 1840, as, a, part, of, postal, reforms, promoted, by, sir, rowland, hill, with, its, introduction, the, postage, fee, was, paid, by, the, sender, and, not, the, recipient, though, it, was, still, possible, to, send, mail, without, prepaying, from, when, the, first, postage, stamps, were, used, postmarks, were, applied, to, prevent, the, stamps, being, used, again, the, first, stamp, the, penny, black, became, available, for, purchase, 1, may, 1840, to, be, valid, as, of, 6, may, 1840, two, days, later, 8, may, 1840, the, two, penny, blue, was, introduced, the, penny, black, was, sufficient, for, a, letter, less, than, half, an, ounce, to, be, sent, anywhere, within, the, united, kingdom, both, stamps, included, an, engraving, of, the, young, queen, victoria, without, perforations, as, the, first, stamps, were, separated, from, their, sheets, by, cutting, them, with, scissors, the, first, stamps, did, not, need, to, show, the, issuing, country, so, no, country, name, was, included, on, them, the, united, kingdom, remains, the, only, country, to, omit, its, name, on, postage, stamps, using, the, reigning, monarch, s, head, as, country, identification, following, the, introduction, of, the, postage, stamp, in, the, united, kingdom, prepaid, postage, considerably, increased, the, number, of, letters, mailed, before, 1839, the, number, of, letters, sent, in, the, united, kingdom, was, typically, 76, million, by, 1850, this, increased, five, fold, to, 350, million, continuing, to, grow, rapidly, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, when, newer, methods, of, indicating, the, payment, of, postage, reduced, the, use, of, stamps, other, countries, soon, followed, the, united, kingdom, with, their, own, stamps, the, canton, of, z, rich, in, switzerland, issued, the, z, rich, 4, and, 6, rappen, on, 1, march, 1843, although, the, penny, black, could, be, used, to, send, a, letter, less, than, half, an, ounce, anywhere, within, the, united, kingdom, the, swiss, did, not, initially, adopt, that, system, instead, continuing, to, calculate, mail, rates, based, on, distance, to, be, delivered, brazil, issued, the, bull, s, eye, stamp, on, 1, august, 1843, using, the, same, printer, used, for, the, penny, black, brazil, opted, for, an, abstract, design, instead, of, the, portrait, of, emperor, pedro, ii, so, his, image, would, not, be, disfigured, by, a, postmark, in, 1845, some, postmasters, in, the, united, states, issued, their, own, stamps, but, it, was, not, until, 1847, that, the, first, official, united, states, stamps, were, issued, 5, and, 10, cent, issues, depicting, benjamin, franklin, and, george, washington, a, few, other, countries, issued, stamps, in, the, late, 1840s, the, famous, mauritius, post, office, stamps, were, issued, by, mauritius, in, september, 1847, many, others, such, as, india, started, their, use, in, the, 1850s, and, by, the, 1860s, most, countries, issued, stamps, perforation, of, postage, stamps, began, in, january, 1854, the, first, officially, perforated, stamps, were, issued, in, february, 1854, stamps, from, henry, archer, s, perforation, trials, were, issued, in, the, last, few, months, of, 1850, during, the, 1851, parliamentary, session, at, the, house, of, commons, of, the, united, kingdom, and, finally, in, 1853, 54, after, the, united, kingdom, government, paid, archer, 4, 000, for, his, machine, and, the, patent, the, universal, postal, union, established, in, 1874, prescribed, that, nations, shall, only, issue, postage, stamps, according, to, the, quantity, of, real, use, and, no, living, persons, shall, be, taken, as, subjects, the, latter, rule, lost, its, significance, after, world, war, i, after, world, war, ii, it, became, customary, in, some, countries, especially, small, arab, nations, to, issue, postage, stamps, en, masse, as, it, was, realized, how, profitable, that, was, during, the, 21st, century, the, amount, of, mail, and, the, use, of, postage, stamps, accordingly, has, reduced, in, the, world, because, of, electronic, mail, and, other, technological, innovations, iceland, has, already, announced, that, it, will, not, issue, new, stamps, for, collectors, anymore, because, the, sales, have, decreased, and, there, are, enough, stamps, in, the, stock, in, 2013, the, netherlands, postnl, introduced, postzegelcodes, a, nine, character, alphanumeric, code, that, is, written, as, a, 3x3, grid, on, the, piece, of, mail, as, an, alternative, to, stamps, in, december, 2020, 590, 000, people, sent, cards, with, these, handwritten, codes, when, the, first, postage, stamps, were, issued, in, the, 1840s, they, followed, an, almost, identical, standard, in, shape, size, and, general, subject, matter, they, were, rectangular, in, shape, they, bore, the, images, of, queens, presidents, and, other, political, figures, they, also, depicted, the, denomination, of, the, postage, paid, and, with, the, exception, of, the, united, kingdom, depicted, the, name, of, the, country, from, which, issued, nearly, all, early, postage, stamps, depict, images, of, national, leaders, only, soon, after, the, introduction, of, the, postage, stamp, other, subjects, and, designs, began, to, appear, some, designs, were, welcome, others, widely, criticized, for, example, in, 1869, the, united, states, post, office, broke, the, tradition, of, depicting, presidents, or, other, famous, historical, figures, instead, using, other, subjects, including, a, train, and, horse, see, 1869, pictorial, issue, the, change, was, greeted, with, general, disapproval, and, sometimes, harsh, criticism, from, the, american, public, perforations, are, small, holes, made, between, individual, postage, stamps, on, a, sheet, of, stamps, facilitating, separation, of, a, desired, number, of, stamps, the, resulting, frame, like, rippled, edge, surrounding, the, separated, stamp, defines, a, characteristic, meme, for, the, appearance, of, a, postage, stamp, in, the, first, decade, of, postage, stamps, existence, depending, on, the, country, stamps, were, issued, without, perforations, scissors, or, other, cutting, mechanisms, were, required, to, separate, a, desired, number, of, stamps, from, a, full, sheet, if, cutting, tools, were, not, used, individual, stamps, were, torn, off, this, is, evidenced, by, the, ragged, edges, of, surviving, examples, mechanically, separating, stamps, from, a, sheet, proved, an, inconvenience, for, postal, clerks, and, businesses, both, dealing, with, large, numbers, of, individual, stamps, on, a, daily, basis, by, 1850, methods, such, as, rouletting, wheels, were, being, devised, in, efforts, of, making, stamp, separation, more, convenient, and, less, time, consuming, the, united, kingdom, was, the, first, country, to, issue, postage, stamps, with, perforations, the, first, machine, specifically, designed, to, perforate, sheets, of, postage, stamps, was, invented, in, london, by, henry, archer, an, irish, landowner, and, railroad, man, from, dublin, ireland, the, 1850, penny, red, was, the, first, stamp, to, be, perforated, during, trial, course, of, archer, s, perforating, machine, after, a, period, of, trial, and, error, and, modifications, of, archer, s, invention, new, machines, based, on, the, principles, pioneered, by, archer, were, purchased, and, in, 1854, the, united, kingdom, postal, authorities, started, continuously, issuing, perforated, postage, stamps, in, the, penny, red, and, all, subsequent, designs, in, the, united, states, the, use, of, postage, stamps, caught, on, quickly, and, became, more, widespread, when, on, 3, march, 1851, the, last, day, of, its, legislative, session, congress, passed, the, act, of, march, 3, 1851, an, act, to, reduce, and, modify, the, rates, of, postage, in, the, united, states, similarly, introduced, on, the, last, day, of, the, congressional, session, four, years, later, the, act, of, march, 3, 1855, required, the, prepayment, of, postage, on, all, mailings, thereafter, postage, stamp, use, in, the, united, states, quickly, doubled, and, by, 1861, had, quadrupled, in, 1856, under, the, direction, of, postmaster, general, james, campbell, toppan, and, carpenter, commissioned, by, the, united, states, government, to, print, united, states, postage, stamps, through, the, 1850s, purchased, a, rotary, machine, designed, to, separate, stamps, patented, in, england, in, 1854, by, william, and, henry, bemrose, who, were, printers, in, derby, england, the, original, machine, cut, slits, into, the, paper, rather, than, punching, holes, but, the, machine, was, soon, modified, the, first, stamp, issue, to, be, officially, perforated, the, 3, cent, george, washington, was, issued, by, the, united, states, post, office, on, 24, february, 1857, between, 1857, and, 1861, all, stamps, originally, issued, between, 1851, and, 1856, were, reissued, with, perforations, initial, capacity, was, insufficient, to, perforate, all, stamps, printed, thus, perforated, issues, used, between, february, and, july, 1857, are, scarce, and, quite, valuable, in, addition, to, the, most, common, rectangular, shape, stamps, have, been, issued, in, geometric, circular, triangular, and, pentagonal, and, irregular, shapes, the, united, states, issued, its, first, circular, stamp, in, 2000, as, a, hologram, of, the, earth, sierra, leone, and, tonga, have, issued, stamps, in, the, shapes, of, fruit, stamps, that, are, printed, on, sheets, are, generally, separated, by, perforations, though, more, recently, with, the, advent, of, gummed, stamps, that, do, not, have, to, be, moistened, prior, to, affixing, them, designs, can, incorporate, smooth, edges, although, a, purely, decorative, perforated, edge, is, often, present, stamps, are, most, commonly, made, from, paper, designed, specifically, for, them, and, are, printed, in, sheets, rolls, or, small, booklets, less, commonly, postage, stamps, are, made, of, materials, other, than, paper, such, as, embossed, foil, sometimes, of, gold, switzerland, made, a, stamp, that, contained, a, bit, of, lace, and, one, of, wood, the, united, states, produced, one, of, plastic, east, germany, issued, a, stamp, of, synthetic, chemicals, in, the, netherlands, a, stamp, was, made, of, silver, foil, bhutan, issued, one, with, its, national, anthem, on, a, playable, record, the, subjects, found, on, the, face, of, postage, stamps, are, generally, what, defines, a, particular, stamp, issue, to, the, public, and, are, often, a, reason, why, they, are, saved, by, collectors, or, history, enthusiasts, graphical, subjects, found, on, postage, stamps, have, ranged, from, the, early, portrayals, of, kings, queens, and, presidents, to, later, depictions, of, ships, birds, and, satellites, famous, people, historical, events, comics, dinosaurs, hobbies, knitting, stamp, collecting, sports, holiday, themes, and, a, plethora, of, other, subjects, too, numerous, to, list, artists, designers, engravers, and, administrative, officials, are, involved, with, the, choice, of, subject, matter, and, the, method, of, printing, stamps, early, stamp, images, were, almost, always, produced, from, an, engraving, a, design, etched, into, a, steel, die, which, was, then, hardened, and, whose, impression, was, transferred, to, a, printing, plate, using, an, engraved, image, was, deemed, a, more, secure, way, of, printing, stamps, as, it, was, nearly, impossible, to, counterfeit, a, finely, detailed, image, with, raised, lines, for, anyone, but, a, master, engraver, in, the, mid, 20th, century, stamp, issues, produced, by, other, forms, of, printing, began, to, emerge, such, as, lithography, photogravure, intaglio, and, web, offset, printing, these, later, printing, methods, were, less, expensive, and, typically, produced, images, of, lesser, quality, occasionally, postal, authorities, issue, novelty, scented, or, aromatic, stamps, which, contain, a, scent, more, readily, apparent, when, rubbed, the, effect, is, achieved, by, using, ink, which, contains, microcapsules, that, provide, the, desired, fragrance, when, broken, the, scent, usually, only, lasts, for, a, limited, time, after, production, such, as, a, few, months, or, years, such, stamps, are, usually, related, to, aromatic, subjects, including, coffee, roses, grapes, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, pine, needles, or, freshly, baked, bread, the, first, scented, stamps, were, issued, by, bhutan, in, 1973, apart, from, these, there, are, also, revenue, stamps, used, to, collect, taxes, or, fees, on, items, like, documents, tobacco, alcoholic, drinks, hunting, licenses, and, medicines, and, telegraph, stamps, for, sending, telegrams, which, fall, in, a, separate, category, from, postage, stamps, postage, stamps, are, first, issued, on, a, specific, date, often, referred, to, as, the, first, day, of, issue, a, first, day, cover, usually, consists, of, an, envelope, a, postage, stamp, and, a, postmark, with, the, date, of, the, stamp, s, first, day, of, issue, thereon, starting, in, the, mid, 20th, century, some, countries, began, assigning, the, first, day, of, issue, to, a, place, associated, with, the, subject, of, the, stamp, design, such, as, a, specific, town, or, city, there, are, two, basic, types, of, first, day, covers, fdcs, noted, by, collectors, the, first, and, often, most, desirable, type, among, advanced, collectors, is, a, cover, sent, through, the, mail, in, the, course, of, everyday, usage, without, the, intention, of, the, envelope, and, stamp, ever, being, retrieved, and, collected, the, second, type, of, fdc, is, often, referred, to, as,
