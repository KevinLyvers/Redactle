an, assault, rifle, is, a, select, fire, rifle, that, uses, an, intermediate, rifle, cartridge, and, a, detachable, magazine, assault, rifles, were, first, put, into, mass, production, and, accepted, into, widespread, service, during, world, war, ii, the, first, assault, rifle, to, see, major, usage, was, the, german, stg, 44, a, development, of, the, earlier, mkb, 42, while, immediately, after, world, war, ii, nato, countries, were, equipped, with, battle, rifles, the, development, of, the, m16, rifle, during, the, vietnam, war, prompted, the, adoption, of, assault, rifles, by, the, rest, of, nato, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, assault, rifles, had, become, the, standard, weapon, in, most, of, the, world, s, armies, replacing, full, powered, rifles, and, submachine, guns, in, most, roles, the, two, most, successful, modern, assault, rifles, are, the, ak, 47, and, the, m16, designs, and, their, derivatives, the, term, assault, rifle, is, generally, attributed, to, adolf, hitler, who, used, the, german, word, sturmgewehr, which, translates, to, assault, rifle, as, the, new, name, for, the, mp, 43, maschinenpistole, subsequently, known, as, the, sturmgewehr, 44, allied, propaganda, suggested, that, the, name, was, chosen, for, propaganda, purposes, but, the, main, purpose, was, to, differentiate, the, sturmgewehr, from, german, submachine, guns, such, as, the, mp, 40, it, has, been, suggested, however, that, the, heereswaffenamt, was, responsible, for, the, name, sturmgewehr, and, hitler, had, no, input, besides, signing, the, production, order, furthermore, hitler, was, initially, opposed, to, the, idea, of, a, new, infantry, rifle, as, germany, lacked, the, industrial, capacity, to, replace, the, 12, 000, 000, karabiner, 98k, rifles, already, in, service, only, changing, his, mind, once, he, saw, it, first, hand, the, stg, 44, is, generally, considered, the, first, selective, fire, military, rifle, to, popularize, the, assault, rifle, concept, today, the, term, assault, rifle, is, used, to, define, firearms, sharing, the, same, basic, characteristics, as, the, stg, 44, the, u, s, army, defines, assault, rifles, as, short, compact, selective, fire, weapons, that, fire, a, cartridge, intermediate, in, power, between, submachine, gun, and, rifle, cartridges, in, this, strict, definition, a, firearm, must, have, at, least, the, following, characteristics, to, be, considered, an, assault, rifle, rifles, that, meet, most, of, these, criteria, but, not, all, are, not, assault, rifles, according, to, the, u, s, army, s, definition, for, example, in, the, united, states, selective, fire, rifles, are, legally, defined, as, machine, guns, and, civilian, ownership, of, those, has, been, tightly, regulated, since, 1934, under, the, national, firearms, act, and, since, 1986, under, the, firearm, owners, protection, act, however, the, term, assault, rifle, is, often, conflated, with, assault, weapon, a, u, s, legal, category, with, varying, definitions, which, includes, many, semi, automatic, weapons, this, use, has, been, described, as, incorrect, and, a, misapplication, of, the, term, the, 1890s, cei, rigotti, prototype, was, built, to, fire, the, fully, powered, 7, 65, 53mm, mauser, and, the, weaker, 6, 5, 52mm, carcano, it, was, somewhat, of, a, predecessor, however, it, had, its, magazine, fixed, the, fedorov, avtomat, also, anglicized, as, federov, russian, romanized, avtom, t, fy, dorova, ipa, lit, fyodorov, s, automatic, rifle, is, a, select, fire, infantry, rifle, and, also, one, of, the, world, s, first, operational, automatic, rifles, designed, by, vladimir, grigoryevich, fyodorov, in, 1915, and, produced, in, the, russian, empire, and, later, in, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, a, total, of, 3, 200, fedorov, rifles, were, manufactured, between, 1915, and, 1924, in, the, city, of, kovrov, the, vast, majority, of, them, were, made, after, 1920, the, weapon, saw, limited, combat, in, world, war, i, but, was, used, more, substantially, in, the, russian, civil, war, and, in, the, winter, war, some, consider, it, to, be, an, early, predecessor, or, ancestor, of, the, modern, assault, rifle, the, germans, were, the, first, to, pioneer, the, assault, rifle, concept, during, world, war, ii, based, upon, research, that, showed, that, most, firefights, happen, within, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, and, that, contemporary, rifles, were, overpowered, for, most, small, arms, combat, they, would, soon, develop, a, select, fire, intermediate, powered, rifle, combining, the, firepower, of, a, submachine, gun, with, the, range, and, accuracy, of, a, rifle, the, result, was, the, sturmgewehr, 44, an, improvement, of, the, earlier, maschinenkarabiner, 42, h, and, approximately, half, a, million, sturmgewehrs, were, produced, by, the, war, s, end, it, fired, a, new, and, revolutionary, intermediate, powered, cartridge, the, 7, 92, 33mm, kurz, this, new, cartridge, was, developed, by, shortening, the, standard, 7, 92, 57mm, mauser, round, and, giving, it, a, lighter, 125, grain, bullet, which, limited, range, but, allowed, for, more, controllable, automatic, fire, a, smaller, lighter, cartridge, also, allowed, soldiers, to, carry, more, ammunition, to, support, the, higher, consumption, rate, of, automatic, fire, the, sturmgewehr, 44, features, an, inexpensive, easy, to, make, stamped, steel, design, and, a, 30, round, detachable, box, magazine, this, weapon, was, the, prototype, of, all, successful, automatic, rifles, characteristically, and, unlike, previous, rifles, it, had, a, straight, stock, with, the, barrel, under, the, gas, cylinder, to, reduce, the, turning, moment, of, recoil, of, the, rifle, in, the, shoulder, and, thus, help, reduce, the, tendency, of, shots, to, climb, in, automatic, fire, the, barrel, and, overall, length, were, shorter, than, a, traditional, rifle, and, it, had, a, pistol, grip, to, hold, the, weapon, more, securely, in, automatic, fire, the, principle, of, this, weapon, the, reduction, of, muzzle, impulse, to, get, usable, automatic, fire, within, the, actual, ranges, of, combat, was, probably, the, most, important, advance, in, small, arms, since, the, invention, of, smokeless, powder, like, the, germans, the, soviets, were, influenced, by, experience, showing, that, most, combat, engagements, occur, within, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, and, that, their, soldiers, were, consistently, outgunned, by, heavily, armed, german, troops, especially, those, armed, with, sturmgewehr, 44, assault, rifles, on, july, 15, 1943, a, sturmgewehr, was, demonstrated, before, the, people, s, commissariat, of, arms, of, the, ussr, the, soviets, were, so, impressed, with, the, sturmgewehr, that, they, immediately, set, about, developing, an, intermediate, caliber, automatic, rifle, of, their, own, to, replace, the, badly, outdated, mosin, nagant, bolt, action, rifles, and, ppsh, 41, submachine, guns, that, armed, most, of, the, red, army, the, soviets, soon, developed, the, 7, 62, 39mm, m43, cartridge, which, was, first, used, in, the, semi, automatic, sks, carbine, and, the, rpd, light, machine, gun, hugo, schmeisser, the, designer, of, the, sturmgewehr, was, captured, after, world, war, ii, and, likely, helped, develop, the, ak, 47, assault, rifle, which, would, quickly, replace, the, sks, and, mosin, in, soviet, service, the, ak, 47, was, finalized, adopted, and, entered, widespread, service, in, the, soviet, army, in, the, early, 1950s, its, firepower, ease, of, use, low, production, costs, and, reliability, were, perfectly, suited, for, the, red, army, s, new, mobile, warfare, doctrines, in, the, 1960s, the, soviets, introduced, the, rpk, light, machine, gun, itself, an, ak, 47, type, weapon, with, a, bipod, a, stronger, receiver, and, a, longer, heavier, barrel, that, would, eventually, replace, the, rpd, light, machine, gun, the, ak, 47, was, widely, supplied, or, sold, to, nations, allied, with, the, ussr, and, the, blueprints, were, shared, with, several, friendly, nations, the, people, s, republic, of, china, standing, out, among, these, with, the, type, 56, as, a, result, more, ak, type, weapons, have, been, produced, than, all, other, assault, rifles, combined, as, of, 2004, of, the, estimated, 500, million, firearms, worldwide, approximately, 100, million, belong, to, the, kalashnikov, family, three, quarters, of, which, are, ak, 47s, the, u, s, army, was, influenced, by, combat, experience, with, semi, automatic, weapons, such, as, the, m1, garand, and, m1, carbine, which, enjoyed, a, significant, advantage, over, enemies, armed, primarily, with, bolt, action, rifles, although, u, s, army, studies, of, world, war, ii, combat, accounts, had, very, similar, results, to, that, of, the, germans, and, soviets, the, u, s, army, failed, to, recognize, the, importance, of, the, assault, rifle, concept, and, instead, maintained, its, traditional, views, and, preference, for, high, powered, semi, automatic, rifles, at, the, time, the, u, s, army, believed, that, the, sturmgewehr, 44, was, intended, in, a, general, way, to, serve, the, same, purpose, as, the, u, s, carbine, and, was, in, many, ways, inferior, to, the, m1, carbine, and, was, of, little, importance, after, world, war, ii, the, united, states, military, started, looking, for, a, single, automatic, rifle, to, replace, the, m1, garand, m1, m2, carbines, m1918, browning, automatic, rifle, m3, grease, gun, and, thompson, submachine, gun, early, experiments, with, select, fire, versions, of, the, m1, garand, proved, disappointing, during, the, korean, war, the, select, fire, m2, carbine, largely, replaced, the, submachine, gun, in, u, s, service, and, became, the, most, widely, used, carbine, variant, combat, experience, suggested, that, the, 30, carbine, round, was, under, powered, american, weapons, designers, reached, the, same, conclusion, as, the, german, and, soviet, ones, an, intermediate, round, was, necessary, and, recommended, a, small, caliber, high, velocity, cartridge, senior, american, commanders, had, faced, fanatical, enemies, and, experienced, major, logistical, problems, during, world, war, ii, and, the, korean, war, and, insisted, that, a, single, powerful, 30, caliber, cartridge, be, developed, that, could, be, used, by, the, new, automatic, rifle, and, also, by, the, new, general, purpose, machine, gun, gpmg, in, concurrent, development, this, culminated, in, the, development, of, the, 7, 62, 51mm, nato, cartridge, and, the, m14, rifle, which, was, basically, an, improved, select, fire, m1, garand, with, a, 20, round, magazine, the, u, s, also, adopted, the, m60, gpmg, which, replaced, the, m1919, browning, machine, gun, in, major, combat, roles, its, nato, partners, adopted, the, fn, fal, and, heckler, koch, g3, rifles, as, well, as, the, fn, mag, and, rheinmetall, mg3, gpmgs, the, fn, fal, is, a, 7, 62, 51mm, selective, fire, automatic, rifle, produced, by, the, belgian, armaments, manufacturer, fabrique, nationale, de, herstal, fn, during, the, cold, war, it, was, adopted, by, many, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, countries, most, notably, with, the, british, commonwealth, as, the, semi, automatic, l1a1, it, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, rifles, in, history, having, been, used, by, more, than, 90, countries, the, fal, was, predominantly, chambered, for, the, 7, 62mm, nato, round, and, because, of, its, prevalence, and, widespread, use, among, the, armed, forces, of, many, western, nations, during, the, cold, war, it, was, nicknamed, the, right, arm, of, the, free, world, the, heckler, koch, g3, is, a, 7, 62, 51mm, selective, fire, automatic, rifle, produced, by, the, german, armament, manufacturer, heckler, koch, gmbh, h, k, in, collaboration, with, the, spanish, state, owned, design, and, development, agency, cetme, centro, de, estudios, t, cnicos, de, materiales, especiales, the, rifle, proved, successful, in, the, export, market, being, adopted, by, the, armed, forces, of, over, 60, countries, after, world, war, ii, german, technicians, involved, in, developing, the, sturmgewehr, 45, continued, their, research, in, france, at, ceam, the, stg, 45, mechanism, was, modified, by, ludwig, vorgrimler, and, theodor, l, ffler, at, the, mulhouse, facility, between, 1946, and, 1949, vorgrimler, later, went, to, work, at, cetme, in, spain, and, developed, the, line, of, cetme, automatic, rifles, based, on, his, improved, stg, 45, design, germany, eventually, purchased, the, license, for, the, cetme, design, and, manufactured, the, heckler, koch, g3, as, well, as, an, entire, line, of, weapons, built, on, the, same, system, one, of, the, most, famous, being, the, mp5, smg, the, first, confrontations, between, the, ak, 47, and, the, m14, assault, rifle, vs, battle, rifle, came, in, the, early, part, of, the, vietnam, war, battlefield, reports, indicated, that, the, m14, was, uncontrollable, in, full, auto, and, that, soldiers, could, not, carry, enough, ammunition, to, maintain, fire, superiority, over, the, ak, 47, and, while, the, m2, carbine, offered, a, high, rate, of, fire, it, was, under, powered, and, ultimately, outclassed, by, the, ak, 47, a, replacement, was, needed, a, medium, between, the, traditional, preference, for, high, powered, rifles, such, as, the, m14, and, the, lightweight, firepower, of, the, m2, carbine, as, a, result, the, army, was, forced, to, reconsider, a, 1957, request, by, general, willard, g, wyman, commander, of, the, u, s, continental, army, command, conarc, to, develop, a, 223, caliber, 5, 56, mm, select, fire, rifle, weighing, 2, 7, kg, 6, lb, when, loaded, with, a, 20, round, magazine, the, 5, 56, mm, round, had, to, penetrate, a, standard, u, s, helmet, at, 460, metres, 500, yd, and, retain, a, velocity, in, excess, of, the, speed, of, sound, while, matching, or, exceeding, the, wounding, ability, of, the, 30, carbine, cartridge, this, request, ultimately, resulted, in, the, development, of, a, scaled, down, version, of, the, armalite, ar, 10, called, the, armalite, ar, 15, rifle, however, despite, overwhelming, evidence, that, the, ar, 15, could, bring, more, firepower, to, bear, than, the, m14, the, army, opposed, the, adoption, of, the, new, rifle, in, january, 1963, secretary, of, defense, robert, mcnamara, concluded, that, the, ar, 15, was, the, superior, weapon, system, and, ordered, a, halt, to, m14, production, at, the, time, the, ar, 15, was, the, only, rifle, available, that, could, fulfill, the, requirement, of, a, universal, infantry, weapon, for, issue, to, all, services, after, modifications, most, notably, the, charging, handle, was, re, located, from, under, the, carrying, handle, like, it, was, on, ar, 10, to, the, rear, of, the, receiver, the, newly, redesigned, rifle, was, subsequently, adopted, as, the, m16, rifle, the, m16, was, much, lighter, compared, to, the, m14, it, replaced, ultimately, allowing, soldiers, to, carry, more, ammunition, the, air, cooled, gas, operated, magazine, fed, assault, rifle, was, made, of, steel, aluminum, alloy, and, composite, plastics, truly, cutting, edge, for, the, time, designed, with, full, and, semi, automatic, capabilities, the, weapon, initially, did, not, respond, well, to, wet, and, dirty, conditions, sometimes, even, jamming, in, combat, after, a, few, minor, modifications, the, weapon, gained, in, popularity, among, troops, on, the, battlefield, despite, its, early, failures, the, m16, proved, to, be, a, revolutionary, design, and, stands, as, the, longest, continuously, serving, rifle, in, american, military, history, it, has, been, adopted, by, many, u, s, allies, and, the, 5, 56, 45mm, nato, cartridge, has, become, not, only, the, nato, standard, but, the, standard, assault, rifle, cartridge, in, much, of, the, world, it, also, led, to, the, development, of, small, caliber, high, velocity, service, rifles, by, every, major, army, in, the, world, including, the, ussr, and, people, s, republic, of, china, today, many, small, arms, experts, consider, the, m16, the, standard, by, which, all, other, assault, rifles, are, judged, during, the, 1960s, other, countries, would, follow, the, americans, lead, and, begin, to, develop, 5, 56, 45mm, assault, rifles, most, notably, germany, with, the, heckler, koch, hk33, the, hk33, was, essentially, a, smaller, 5, 56mm, version, of, the, 7, 62, 51mm, heckler, koch, g3, rifle, as, one, of, the, first, 5, 56mm, assault, rifles, on, the, market, it, would, go, on, to, become, one, of, the, most, widely, distributed, assault, rifles, the, hk33, featured, a, modular, design, with, a, wide, range, of, accessories, telescoping, butt, stocks, optics, bi, pods, etc, that, could, be, easily, removed, and, arranged, in, a, variety, of, configurations, the, adoption, of, the, m16, the, h, k33, and, the, 5, 56, 45mm, cartridge, inspired, an, international, trend, towards, relatively, small, sized, lightweight, high, velocity, military, service, cartridges, that, allow, a, soldier, to, carry, more, ammunition, for, the, same, weight, compared, to, the, larger, and, heavier, 7, 62, 51mm, nato, cartridge, the, 5, 56mm, cartridge, is, also, much, easier, to, shoot, in, 1961, marksmanship, testing, the, u, s, army, found, that, 43, of, ar, 15, shooters, achieved, expert, while, only, 22, of, m, 14, rifle, shooters, did, so, also, a, lower, recoil, impulse, allows, for, more, controllable, automatic, weapons, fire, in, march, 1970, the, u, s, recommended, that, all, nato, forces, adopt, the, 5, 56, 45mm, cartridge, this, shift, represented, a, change, in, the, philosophy, of, the, military, s, long, held, position, about, caliber, size, by, the, middle, of, the, 1970s, other, armies, were, looking, at, assault, rifle, type, weapons, a, nato, standardization, effort, soon, started, and, tests, of, various, rounds, were, carried, out, starting, in, 1977, the, u, s, offered, the, 5, 56, 45mm, m193, round, but, there, were, concerns, about, its, penetration, in, the, face, of, the, wider, introduction, of, body, armor, in, the, end, the, belgian, 5, 56, 45mm, ss109, round, was, chosen, stanag, 4172, in, october, 1980, the, ss109, round, was, based, on, the, u, s, cartridge, but, included, a, new, stronger, heavier, 62, grain, bullet, design, with, better, long, range, performance, and, improved, penetration, specifically, to, consistently, penetrate, the, side, of, a, steel, helmet, at, 600, metres, or, 2, 000, feet, also, during, the, 1970s, finland, israel, and, south, africa, introduced, ak, type, assault, rifles, in, 5, 56, 45mm, sweden, began, the, transition, with, trails, in, 1981, and, full, adaptation, in, 1986, during, the, 1990s, russia, developed, the, ak, 101, in, 5, 56, 45mm, nato, for, the, world, export, market, in, addition, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, hungary, poland, and, yugoslavia, i, e, serbia, have, also, rechambered, their, locally, produced, assault, rifles, to, 5, 56mm, nato, the, ak, 74, assault, rifle, was, a, soviet, answer, to, the, u, s, m16, the, soviet, military, realized, that, the, m16, had, better, range, and, accuracy, over, the, akm, and, that, its, lighter, cartridge, allowed, soldiers, to, carry, more, ammunition, therefore, in, 1967, the, ussr, issued, an, official, requirement, to, replace, the, akm, and, the, 7, 62, 39mm, cartridge, they, soon, began, to, develop, the, ak, 74, and, the, 5, 45, 39mm, cartridge, ak, 74, production, began, in, 1974, and, it, was, unveiled, in, 1977, when, it, was, carried, by, soviet, parachute, troops, during, the, annual, red, square, parade, it, would, soon, replace, the, akm, and, become, the, standard, soviet, infantry, rifle, in, 1979, the, ak, 74, saw, combat, for, the, first, time, in, afghanistan, where, the, lethality, of, the, 5, 45mm, rounds, led, to, the, mujahadeen, dubbing, them, poison, bullets, the, adoption, of, the, 5, 56mm, nato, and, the, russian, 5, 45, 39mm, cartridges, cemented, the, worldwide, trend, toward, small, caliber, high, velocity, cartridges, following, the, adoption, of, the, m16, carbine, variants, were, also, adopted, for, close, quarters, operations, the, ar, 15, family, of, weapons, served, through, the, vietnam, war, however, these, compact, assault, rifles, had, design, issues, as, the, barrel, length, was, halved, to, 10, inches, 250, mm, which, upset, the, ballistics, reducing, its, range, and, accuracy, and, leading, to, considerable, muzzle, flash, and, blast, so, that, a, large, flash, suppressor, had, to, be, fitted, nevertheless, as, a, short, range, weapon, it, is, quite, adequate, and, thus, its, caliber, is, classed, as, a, submachine, gun, other, compact, assault, rifles, such, as, the, hk53, aks, 74u, and, the, daewoo, k1, have, been, made, and, they, have, also, been, called, submachine, guns, in, 1977, austria, introduced, the, 5, 56, 45mm, steyr, aug, bullpup, rifle, often, cited, as, the, first, successful, bullpup, rifle, finding, service, with, the, armed, forces, of, over, twenty, countries, it, was, highly, advanced, for, the, 1970s, combining, in, the, same, weapon, the, bullpup, configuration, a, polymer, housing, dual, vertical, grips, an, optical, sight, as, standard, and, a, modular, design, highly, reliable, light, and, accurate, the, steyr, aug, showed, clearly, the, potential, of, the, bullpup, layout, in, 1978, france, introduced, the, 5, 56, 45mm, famas, bullpup, rifle, in, 1985, the, british, introduced, the, 5, 56, 45mm, l85, bullpup, rifle, in, the, late, 1990s, israel, introduced, the, 5, 56mm, nato, tavor, tar, 21, in, 1997, china, adopted, the, qbz, 95, in, the, new, 5, 8, 42mm, cartridge, which, they, claim, is, superior, to, both, the, 5, 56, 45mm, and, the, 5, 45, 39mm, by, the, turn, of, the, century, the, bullpup, assault, rifle, design, had, achieved, worldwide, acceptance, the, heckler, koch, g36, is, a, 5, 56, 45mm, assault, rifle, designed, in, the, early, 1990s, by, heckler, koch, in, germany, as, a, replacement, for, the, heavier, g3, it, was, accepted, into, service, with, the, bundeswehr, in, 1997, replacing, the, g3, the, g36, is, gas, operated, and, feeds, from, a, 30, round, detachable, box, magazine, or, 100, round, c, mag, drum, magazine, the, g36, was, made, with, the, extensive, use, of, lightweight, corrosion, resistant, synthetic, materials, in, its, design, the, receiver, housing, stock, trigger, group, including, the, fire, control, selector, and, firing, mechanism, parts, magazine, well, handguard, and, carrying, handle, are, all, made, of, a, carbon, fiber, reinforced, polyamide, the, receiver, has, an, integrated, steel, barrel, trunnion, with, locking, recesses, and, a, nylon, 66, steel, reinforced, receiver, the, standard, bundeswehr, versions, of, the, g36, are, equipped, with, a, unique, zf, 3, 4, dual, optical, sight, that, combines, a, 3, magnified, telescopic, sight, and, an, unmagnified, reflex, sight, mounted, on, top, of, the, telescopic, sight, widely, distributed, it, has, been, adopted, by, over, 40, countries, and, prompted, other, nations, to, develop, similar, composite, designs, such, as, the, fx, 05, xiuhcoatl
