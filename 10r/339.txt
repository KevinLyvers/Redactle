an, electric, motor, is, a, machine, that, converts, electrical, energy, into, mechanical, energy, most, electric, motors, operate, through, the, interaction, between, the, motor, s, magnetic, field, and, electric, current, in, a, wire, winding, to, generate, force, in, the, form, of, torque, applied, on, the, motor, s, shaft, an, electric, generator, is, mechanically, identical, to, an, electric, motor, but, operates, in, reverse, converting, mechanical, energy, into, electrical, energy, electric, motors, can, be, powered, by, direct, current, dc, sources, such, as, from, batteries, or, rectifiers, or, by, alternating, current, ac, sources, such, as, a, power, grid, inverters, or, electrical, generators, electric, motors, may, be, classified, by, considerations, such, as, power, source, type, construction, application, and, type, of, motion, output, they, can, be, brushed, or, brushless, single, phase, two, phase, or, three, phase, axial, or, radial, flux, and, may, be, air, cooled, or, liquid, cooled, standardized, motors, provide, power, for, industrial, use, the, largest, are, used, for, ship, propulsion, pipeline, compression, and, pumped, storage, applications, with, output, exceeding, 100, megawatts, applications, include, industrial, fans, blowers, and, pumps, machine, tools, household, appliances, power, tools, vehicles, and, disk, drives, small, motors, may, be, found, in, electric, watches, in, certain, applications, such, as, in, regenerative, braking, with, traction, motors, electric, motors, can, be, used, in, reverse, as, generators, to, recover, energy, that, might, otherwise, be, lost, as, heat, and, friction, electric, motors, produce, linear, or, rotary, force, torque, intended, to, propel, some, external, mechanism, this, makes, them, a, type, of, actuator, they, are, generally, designed, for, continuous, rotation, or, for, linear, movement, over, a, significant, distance, compared, to, its, size, solenoids, also, convert, electrical, power, to, mechanical, motion, but, over, only, a, limited, distance, before, modern, electromagnetic, motors, experimental, motors, that, worked, by, electrostatic, force, were, investigated, the, first, electric, motors, were, simple, electrostatic, devices, described, in, experiments, by, scottish, monk, andrew, gordon, and, american, experimenter, benjamin, franklin, in, the, 1740s, the, theoretical, principle, behind, them, coulomb, s, law, was, discovered, but, not, published, by, henry, cavendish, in, 1771, this, law, was, discovered, independently, by, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, in, 1785, who, published, it, so, that, it, is, now, known, with, his, name, due, to, the, difficulty, of, generating, the, high, voltages, they, required, electrostatic, motors, were, never, used, for, practical, purposes, the, invention, of, the, electrochemical, battery, by, alessandro, volta, in, 1799, made, possible, the, production, of, persistent, electric, currents, hans, christian, rsted, discovered, in, 1820, that, an, electric, current, creates, a, magnetic, field, which, can, exert, a, force, on, a, magnet, it, only, took, a, few, weeks, for, andr, marie, amp, re, to, develop, the, first, formulation, of, the, electromagnetic, interaction, and, present, the, amp, re, s, force, law, that, described, the, production, of, mechanical, force, by, the, interaction, of, an, electric, current, and, a, magnetic, field, the, first, demonstration, of, the, effect, with, a, rotary, motion, was, given, by, michael, faraday, on, 3, september, 1821, in, the, basement, of, the, royal, institution, a, free, hanging, wire, was, dipped, into, a, pool, of, mercury, on, which, a, permanent, magnet, pm, was, placed, when, a, current, was, passed, through, the, wire, the, wire, rotated, around, the, magnet, showing, that, the, current, gave, rise, to, a, close, circular, magnetic, field, around, the, wire, faraday, published, the, results, of, his, discovery, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, science, and, sent, copies, of, his, paper, along, with, pocket, sized, models, of, his, device, to, colleagues, around, the, world, so, they, could, also, witness, the, phenomenon, of, electromagnetic, rotations, this, motor, is, often, demonstrated, in, physics, experiments, substituting, brine, for, toxic, mercury, barlow, s, wheel, was, an, early, refinement, to, this, faraday, demonstration, although, these, and, similar, homopolar, motors, remained, unsuited, to, practical, application, until, late, in, the, century, in, 1827, hungarian, physicist, nyos, jedlik, started, experimenting, with, electromagnetic, coils, after, jedlik, solved, the, technical, problems, of, continuous, rotation, with, the, invention, of, the, commutator, he, called, his, early, devices, electromagnetic, self, rotors, although, they, were, used, only, for, teaching, in, 1828, jedlik, demonstrated, the, first, device, to, contain, the, three, main, components, of, practical, dc, motors, the, stator, rotor, and, commutator, the, device, employed, no, permanent, magnets, as, the, magnetic, fields, of, both, the, stationary, and, revolving, components, were, produced, solely, by, the, currents, flowing, through, their, windings, the, first, commutator, dc, electric, motor, capable, of, turning, machinery, was, invented, by, english, scientist, william, sturgeon, in, 1832, following, sturgeon, s, work, a, commutator, type, direct, current, electric, motor, was, built, by, american, inventors, thomas, davenport, and, emily, davenport, which, he, patented, in, 1837, the, motors, ran, at, up, to, 600, revolutions, per, minute, and, powered, machine, tools, and, a, printing, press, due, to, the, high, cost, of, primary, battery, power, the, motors, were, commercially, unsuccessful, and, bankrupted, the, davenports, several, inventors, followed, sturgeon, in, the, development, of, dc, motors, but, all, encountered, the, same, battery, cost, issues, as, no, electricity, distribution, system, was, available, at, the, time, no, practical, commercial, market, emerged, for, these, motors, after, many, other, more, or, less, successful, attempts, with, relatively, weak, rotating, and, reciprocating, apparatus, prussian, russian, moritz, von, jacobi, created, the, first, real, rotating, electric, motor, in, may, 1834, it, developed, remarkable, mechanical, output, power, his, motor, set, a, world, record, which, jacobi, improved, four, years, later, in, september, 1838, his, second, motor, was, powerful, enough, to, drive, a, boat, with, 14, people, across, a, wide, river, it, was, also, in, 1839, 40, that, other, developers, managed, to, build, motors, with, similar, and, then, higher, performance, in, 1827, 1828, jedlik, built, a, device, using, similar, principles, to, those, used, in, his, electromagnetic, self, rotors, that, was, capable, of, useful, work, he, built, a, model, electric, vehicle, that, same, year, a, major, turning, point, came, in, 1864, when, antonio, pacinotti, first, described, the, ring, armature, although, initially, conceived, in, a, dc, generator, i, e, a, dynamo, this, featured, symmetrically, grouped, coils, closed, upon, themselves, and, connected, to, the, bars, of, a, commutator, the, brushes, of, which, delivered, practically, non, fluctuating, current, the, first, commercially, successful, dc, motors, followed, the, developments, by, z, nobe, gramme, who, in, 1871, reinvented, pacinotti, s, design, and, adopted, some, solutions, by, werner, siemens, a, benefit, to, dc, machines, came, from, the, discovery, of, the, reversibility, of, the, electric, machine, which, was, announced, by, siemens, in, 1867, and, observed, by, pacinotti, in, 1869, gramme, accidentally, demonstrated, it, on, the, occasion, of, the, 1873, vienna, world, s, fair, when, he, connected, two, such, dc, devices, up, to, 2, km, from, each, other, using, one, of, them, as, a, generator, and, the, other, as, motor, the, drum, rotor, was, introduced, by, friedrich, von, hefner, alteneck, of, siemens, halske, to, replace, pacinotti, s, ring, armature, in, 1872, thus, improving, the, machine, efficiency, the, laminated, rotor, was, introduced, by, siemens, halske, the, following, year, achieving, reduced, iron, losses, and, increased, induced, voltages, in, 1880, jonas, wenstr, m, provided, the, rotor, with, slots, for, housing, the, winding, further, increasing, the, efficiency, in, 1886, frank, julian, sprague, invented, the, first, practical, dc, motor, a, non, sparking, device, that, maintained, relatively, constant, speed, under, variable, loads, other, sprague, electric, inventions, about, this, time, greatly, improved, grid, electric, distribution, prior, work, done, while, employed, by, thomas, edison, allowed, power, from, electric, motors, to, be, returned, to, the, electric, grid, provided, for, electric, distribution, to, trolleys, via, overhead, wires, and, the, trolley, pole, and, provided, control, systems, for, electric, operations, this, allowed, sprague, to, use, electric, motors, to, invent, the, first, electric, trolley, system, in, 1887, 88, in, richmond, virginia, the, electric, elevator, and, control, system, in, 1892, and, the, electric, subway, with, independently, powered, centrally, controlled, cars, the, latter, were, first, installed, in, 1892, in, chicago, by, the, south, side, elevated, railroad, where, it, became, popularly, known, as, the, l, sprague, s, motor, and, related, inventions, led, to, an, explosion, of, interest, and, use, in, electric, motors, for, industry, the, development, of, electric, motors, of, acceptable, efficiency, was, delayed, for, several, decades, by, failure, to, recognize, the, extreme, importance, of, an, air, gap, between, the, rotor, and, stator, efficient, designs, have, a, comparatively, small, air, gap, the, st, louis, motor, long, used, in, classrooms, to, illustrate, motor, principles, is, inefficient, for, the, same, reason, as, well, as, appearing, nothing, like, a, modern, motor, electric, motors, revolutionized, industry, industrial, processes, were, no, longer, limited, by, power, transmission, using, line, shafts, belts, compressed, air, or, hydraulic, pressure, instead, every, machine, could, be, equipped, with, its, own, power, source, providing, easy, control, at, the, point, of, use, and, improving, power, transmission, efficiency, electric, motors, applied, in, agriculture, eliminated, human, and, animal, muscle, power, from, such, tasks, as, handling, grain, or, pumping, water, household, uses, like, in, washing, machines, dishwashers, fans, air, conditioners, and, refrigerators, replacing, ice, boxes, of, electric, motors, reduced, heavy, labor, in, the, home, and, made, higher, standards, of, convenience, comfort, and, safety, possible, today, electric, motors, consume, more, than, half, of, the, electric, energy, produced, in, the, us, in, 1824, french, physicist, fran, ois, arago, formulated, the, existence, of, rotating, magnetic, fields, termed, arago, s, rotations, which, by, manually, turning, switches, on, and, off, walter, baily, demonstrated, in, 1879, as, in, effect, the, first, primitive, induction, motor, in, the, 1880s, many, inventors, were, trying, to, develop, workable, ac, motors, because, ac, s, advantages, in, long, distance, high, voltage, transmission, were, offset, by, the, inability, to, operate, motors, on, ac, the, first, alternating, current, commutatorless, induction, motor, was, invented, by, galileo, ferraris, in, 1885, ferraris, was, able, to, improve, his, first, design, by, producing, more, advanced, setups, in, 1886, in, 1888, the, royal, academy, of, science, of, turin, published, ferraris, s, research, detailing, the, foundations, of, motor, operation, while, concluding, at, that, time, that, the, apparatus, based, on, that, principle, could, not, be, of, any, commercial, importance, as, motor, possible, industrial, development, was, envisioned, by, nikola, tesla, who, invented, independently, his, induction, motor, in, 1887, and, obtained, a, patent, in, may, 1888, in, the, same, year, tesla, presented, his, paper, a, new, system, of, alternate, current, motors, and, transformers, to, the, aiee, that, described, three, patented, two, phase, four, stator, pole, motor, types, one, with, a, four, pole, rotor, forming, a, non, self, starting, reluctance, motor, another, with, a, wound, rotor, forming, a, self, starting, induction, motor, and, the, third, a, true, synchronous, motor, with, separately, excited, dc, supply, to, rotor, winding, one, of, the, patents, tesla, filed, in, 1887, however, also, described, a, shorted, winding, rotor, induction, motor, george, westinghouse, who, had, already, acquired, rights, from, ferraris, us, 1, 000, promptly, bought, tesla, s, patents, us, 60, 000, plus, us, 2, 50, per, sold, hp, paid, until, 1897, employed, tesla, to, develop, his, motors, and, assigned, c, f, scott, to, help, tesla, however, tesla, left, for, other, pursuits, in, 1889, the, constant, speed, ac, induction, motor, was, found, not, to, be, suitable, for, street, cars, but, westinghouse, engineers, successfully, adapted, it, to, power, a, mining, operation, in, telluride, colorado, in, 1891, westinghouse, achieved, its, first, practical, induction, motor, in, 1892, and, developed, a, line, of, polyphase, 60, hertz, induction, motors, in, 1893, but, these, early, westinghouse, motors, were, two, phase, motors, with, wound, rotors, b, g, lamme, later, developed, a, rotating, bar, winding, rotor, steadfast, in, his, promotion, of, three, phase, development, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, invented, the, three, phase, induction, motor, in, 1889, of, both, types, cage, rotor, and, wound, rotor, with, a, starting, rheostat, and, the, three, limb, transformer, in, 1890, after, an, agreement, between, aeg, and, maschinenfabrik, oerlikon, doliwo, dobrowolski, and, charles, eugene, lancelot, brown, developed, larger, models, namely, a, 20, hp, squirrel, cage, and, a, 100, hp, wound, rotor, with, a, starting, rheostat, these, were, the, first, three, phase, asynchronous, motors, suitable, for, practical, operation, since, 1889, similar, developments, of, three, phase, machinery, were, started, wenstr, m, at, the, 1891, frankfurt, international, electrotechnical, exhibition, the, first, long, distance, three, phase, system, was, successfully, presented, it, was, rated, 15, kv, and, extended, over, 175, km, from, the, lauffen, waterfall, on, the, neckar, river, the, lauffen, power, station, included, a, 240, kw, 86, v, 40, hz, alternator, and, a, step, up, transformer, while, at, the, exhibition, a, step, down, transformer, fed, a, 100, hp, three, phase, induction, motor, that, powered, an, artificial, waterfall, representing, the, transfer, of, the, original, power, source, the, three, phase, induction, is, now, used, for, the, vast, majority, of, commercial, applications, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, claimed, that, tesla, s, motor, was, not, practical, because, of, two, phase, pulsations, which, prompted, him, to, persist, in, his, three, phase, work, the, general, electric, company, began, developing, three, phase, induction, motors, in, 1891, by, 1896, general, electric, and, westinghouse, signed, a, cross, licensing, agreement, for, the, bar, winding, rotor, design, later, called, the, squirrel, cage, rotor, induction, motor, improvements, flowing, from, these, inventions, and, innovations, were, such, that, a, 100, horsepower, induction, motor, currently, has, the, same, mounting, dimensions, as, a, 7, 5, horsepower, motor, in, 1897, in, 2022, electric, motor, sales, were, estimated, to, be, 800, million, units, increasing, by, 10, annually, electric, motors, consume, 50, of, the, world, s, electricity, since, the, 1980s, the, market, share, of, dc, motors, has, declined, in, favor, of, ac, motors, 89, an, electric, motor, has, two, mechanical, parts, the, rotor, which, moves, and, the, stator, which, does, not, electrically, the, motor, consists, of, two, parts, the, field, magnets, and, the, armature, one, of, which, is, attached, to, the, rotor, and, the, other, to, the, stator, together, they, form, a, magnetic, circuit, the, magnets, create, a, magnetic, field, that, passes, through, the, armature, these, can, be, electromagnets, or, permanent, magnets, the, field, magnet, is, usually, on, the, stator, and, the, armature, on, the, rotor, but, these, may, be, reversed, the, rotor, is, the, moving, part, that, delivers, the, mechanical, power, the, rotor, typically, holds, conductors, that, carry, currents, on, which, the, magnetic, field, of, the, stator, exerts, force, to, turn, the, shaft, the, stator, surrounds, the, rotor, and, usually, holds, field, magnets, which, are, either, electromagnets, wire, windings, around, a, ferromagnetic, iron, core, or, permanent, magnets, these, create, a, magnetic, field, that, passes, through, the, rotor, armature, exerting, force, on, the, rotor, windings, the, stator, core, is, made, up, of, many, thin, metal, sheets, that, are, insulated, from, each, other, called, laminations, these, laminations, are, made, of, electrical, steel, which, has, a, specified, magnetic, permeability, hysteresis, and, saturation, laminations, reduce, losses, that, would, result, from, induced, circulating, eddy, currents, that, would, flow, if, a, solid, core, were, used, mains, powered, ac, motors, typically, immobilize, the, wires, within, the, windings, by, impregnating, them, with, varnish, in, a, vacuum, this, prevents, the, wires, in, the, winding, from, vibrating, against, each, other, which, would, abrade, the, wire, insulation, and, cause, premature, failures, resin, packed, motors, used, in, deep, well, submersible, pumps, washing, machines, and, air, conditioners, encapsulate, the, stator, in, plastic, resin, to, prevent, corrosion, and, or, reduce, conducted, noise, an, air, gap, between, the, stator, and, rotor, allows, it, to, turn, the, width, of, the, gap, has, a, significant, effect, on, the, motor, s, electrical, characteristics, it, is, generally, made, as, small, as, possible, as, a, large, gap, weakens, performance, conversely, gaps, that, are, too, small, may, create, friction, in, addition, to, noise, the, armature, consists, of, wire, windings, on, a, ferromagnetic, core, electric, current, passing, through, the, wire, causes, the, magnetic, field, to, exert, a, force, lorentz, force, on, it, turning, the, rotor, windings, are, coiled, wires, wrapped, around, a, laminated, soft, iron, ferromagnetic, core, so, as, to, form, magnetic, poles, when, energized, with, current, electric, machines, come, in, salient, and, nonsalient, pole, configurations, in, a, salient, pole, motor, the, rotor, and, stator, ferromagnetic, cores, have, projections, called, poles, that, face, each, other, wire, is, wound, around, each, pole, below, the, pole, face, which, become, north, or, south, poles, when, current, flows, through, the, wire, in, a, nonsalient, pole, distributed, field, or, round, rotor, motor, the, ferromagnetic, core, is, a, smooth, cylinder, with, the, windings, distributed, evenly, in, slots, around, the, circumference, supplying, alternating, current, in, the, windings, creates, poles, in, the, core, that, rotate, continuously, a, shaded, pole, motor, has, a, winding, around, part, of, the, pole, that, delays, the, phase, of, the, magnetic, field, for, that, pole, a, commutator, is, a, rotary, electrical, switch, that, supplies, current, to, the, rotor, it, periodically, reverses, the, flow, of, current, in, the, rotor, windings, as, the, shaft, rotates, it, consists, of, a, cylinder, composed, of, multiple, metal, contact, segments, on, the, armature, two, or, more, electrical, contacts, called, brushes, made, of, a, soft, conductive, material, like, carbon, press, against, the, commutator, the, brushes, make, sliding, contact, with, successive, commutator, segments, as, the, rotator, turns, supplying, current, to, the, rotor, the, windings, on, the, rotor, are, connected, to, the, commutator, segments, the, commutator, reverses, the, current, direction, in, the, rotor, windings, with, each, half, turn, 180, so, the, torque, applied, to, the, rotor, is, always, in, the, same, direction, without, this, reversal, the, direction, of, torque, on, each, rotor, winding, would, reverse, with, each, half, turn, stopping, the, rotor, commutated, motors, have, been, mostly, replaced, by, brushless, motors, permanent, magnet, motors, and, induction, motors, the, motor, shaft, extends, outside, of, the, motor, where, it, satisfies, the, load, because, the, forces, of, the, load, are, exerted, beyond, the, outermost, bearing, the, load, is, said, to, be, overhung, the, rotor, is, supported, by, bearings, which, allow, the, rotor, to, turn, on, its, axis, by, transferring, the, force, of, axial, and, radial, loads, from, the, shaft, to, the, motor, housing, a, dc, motor, is, usually, supplied, through, a, split, ring, commutator, as, described, above, ac, motors, commutation, can, be, achieved, using, either, a, slip, ring, commutator, or, external, commutation, it, can, be, fixed, speed, or, variable, speed, control, type, and, can, be, synchronous, or, asynchronous, universal, motors, can, run, on, either, ac, or, dc, dc, motors, can, be, operated, at, variable, speeds, by, adjusting, the, voltage, applied, to, the, terminals, or, by, using, pulse, width, modulation, pwm, ac, motors, operated, at, a, fixed, speed, are, generally, powered, directly, from, the, grid, or, through, motor, soft, starters, ac, motors, operated, at, variable, speeds, are, powered, with, various, power, inverter, variable, frequency, drive, or, electronic, commutator, technologies, the, term, electronic, commutator, is, usually, associated, with, self, commutated, brushless, dc, motor, and, switched, reluctance, motor, applications, electric, motors, operate, on, one, of, three, physical, principles, magnetism, electrostatics, and, piezoelectricity, in, magnetic, motors, magnetic, fields, are, formed, in, both, the, rotor, and, the, stator, the, product, between, these, two, fields, gives, rise, to, a, force, and, thus, a, torque, on, the, motor, shaft, one, or, both, of, these, fields, changes, as, the, rotor, turns, this, is, done, by, switching, the, poles, on, and, off, at, the, right, time, or, varying, the, strength, of, the, pole, motors, operate, on, either, dc, or, ac, current, or, either, ac, motors, can, be, either, asynchronous, or, synchronous, synchronous, motors, require, the, rotor, to, turn, at, the, same, speed, as, the, stator, s, rotating, field, asynchronous, rotors, relax, this, constraint, a, fractional, horsepower, motor, either, has, a, rating, below, about, 1, horsepower, 0, 746, kw, or, is, manufactured, with, a, frame, size, smaller, than, a, standard, 1, hp, motor, many, household, and, industrial, motors, are, in, the, fractional, horsepower, class, excited, pm, ferromagnetic, rotor, two, phase, condenser, single, phase, syrm, hysteresis, hybrid, stepper, linear, transistor, s, or, dc, chopper, electronics, electronics, vfd, when, provided, notes, 1, rotation, is, independent, of, the, frequency, of, the, ac, voltage, 2, rotation, is, equal, to, synchronous, speed, motor, stator, field, speed, 3, in, scim, fixed, speed, operation, rotation, is, equal, to, synchronous, speed, less, slip, speed, 4, in, non, slip, energy, recovery, systems, wrim, is, usually, used, for, motor, starting, but, can, be, used, to, vary, load, speed, 5, variable, speed, operation, 6, whereas, induction, and, synchronous, motor, drives, are, typically, with, either, six, step, or, sinusoidal, waveform, output, bldc, motor, drives, are, usually, with, trapezoidal, current, waveform, the, behavior, of, both, sinusoidal, and, trapezoidal, pm, machines, is, however, identical, in, terms, of, their, fundamental, aspects, 7, in, variable, speed, operation, wrim, is, used, in, slip, energy, recovery, and, double, fed, induction, machine, applications, 8, a, cage, winding, is, a, short, circuited, squirrel, cage, rotor, a, wound, winding, is, connected, externally, through, slip, rings, 9, mostly, single, phase, with, some, three, phase, abbreviations, most, dc, motors, are, small, permanent, magnet, pm, types, they, contain, a, brushed, internal, mechanical, commutation, to, reverse, motor, windings, current, in, synchronism, with, rotation, a, commutated, dc, motor, has, a, set, of, rotating, windings, wound, on, an, armature, mounted, on, a, rotating, shaft, the, shaft, also, carries, the, commutator, thus, every, brushed, dc, motor, has, ac, flowing, through, its, windings, current, flows, through, one, or, more, pairs, of, brushes, that, touch, the, commutator, the, brushes, connect, an, external, source, of, electric, power, to, the, rotating, armature, the, rotating, armature, consists, of, one, or, more, wire, coils, wound, around, a, laminated, magnetically, soft, ferromagnetic, core, current, from, the, brushes, flows, through, the, commutator, and, one, winding, of, the, armature, making, it, a, temporary, magnet, an, electromagnet, the, magnetic, field, produced, interacts, with, a, stationary, magnetic, field, produced, by, either, pms, or, another, winding, a, field, coil, as, part, of, the, motor, frame, the, force, between, the, two, magnetic, fields, rotates, the, shaft, the, commutator, switches, power, to, the, coils, as, the, rotor, turns, keeping, the, poles, from, ever, fully, aligning, with, the, magnetic, poles, of, the, stator, field, so, that, the, rotor, keeps, turning, as, long, as, power, is, applied, many, of, the, limitations, of, the, classic, commutator, dc, motor, are, due, to, the, need, for, brushes, to, maintain, contact, with, the, commutator, creating, friction, the, brushes, create, sparks, while, crossing, the, insulating, gaps, between, commutator, sections, depending, on, the, commutator, design, the, brushes, may, create, short, circuits, between, adjacent, sections, and, hence, coil, ends, furthermore, the, rotor, coils, inductance, causes, the, voltage, across, each, to, rise, when, its, circuit, opens, increasing, the, sparking, this, sparking, limits, the, maximum, speed, of, the, machine, as, too, rapid, sparking, will, overheat, erode, or, even, melt, the, commutator, the, current, density, per, unit, area, of, the, brushes, in, combination, with, their, resistivity, limits, the, motor, s, output, crossing, the, gaps, also, generates, electrical, noise, sparking, generates, rfi, brushes, eventually, wear, out, and, require, replacement, and, the, commutator, itself, is, subject, to, wear, and, maintenance, or, replacement, the, commutator, assembly, on, a, large, motor, is, a, costly, element, requiring, precision, assembly, of, many, parts, on, small, motors, the, commutator, is, usually, permanently, integrated, into, the, rotor, so, replacing, it, usually, requires, replacing, the, rotor, while, most, commutators, are, cylindrical, some, are, flat, segmented, discs, mounted, on, an, insulator, large, brushes, create, a, large, contact, area, which, maximizes, motor, output, while, small, brushes, have, low, mass, to, maximize, the, speed, at, which, the, motor, can, run, without, excessive, sparking, small, brushes, are, desirable, for, their, lower, cost, stiffer, brush, springs, can, be, used, to, make, brushes, of, a, given, mass, work, at, a, higher, speed, despite, greater, friction, losses, lower, efficiency, and, accelerated, brush, and, commutator, wear, therefore, dc, motor, brush, design, entails, a, trade, off, between, output, power, speed, and, efficiency, wear, dc, machines, are, defined, as, follows, the, five, types, of, brushed, dc, motor, are, a, permanent, magnet, pm, motor, does, not, have, a, field, winding, on, the, stator, frame, relying, instead, on, pms, to, provide, the, magnetic, field, compensating, windings, in, series, with, the, armature, may, be, used, on, large, motors, to, improve, commutation, under, load, this, field, is, fixed, and, cannot, be, adjusted, for, speed, control, pm, fields, stators, are, convenient, in, miniature, motors, to, eliminate, the, power, consumption, of, the, field, winding, most, larger, dc, motors, are, of, the, dynamo, type, which, have, stator, windings, historically, pms, could, not, be, made, to, retain, high, flux, if, they, were, disassembled, field, windings, were, more, practical, to, obtain, the, needed, flux, however, large, pms, are, costly, as, well, as, dangerous, and, difficult, to, assemble, this, favors, wound, fields, for, large, machines, to, minimize, overall, weight, and, size, miniature, pm, motors, may, use, high, energy, magnets, made, with, neodymium, most, are, neodymium, iron, boron, alloy, with, their, higher, flux, density, electric, machines, with, high, energy, pms, are, at, least, competitive, with, all, optimally, designed, singly, fed, synchronous, and, induction, electric, machines, miniature, motors, resemble, the, structure, in, the, illustration, except, that, they, have, at, least, three, rotor, poles, to, ensure, starting, regardless, of, rotor, position, and, their, outer, housing, is, a, steel, tube, that, magnetically, links, the, exteriors, of, the, curved, field, magnets, some, of, the, problems, of, the, brushed, dc, motor, are, eliminated, in, the, bldc, design, in, this, motor, the, mechanical, rotating, switch, or, commutator, is, replaced, by, an, external, electronic, switch, synchronised, to, the, rotor, s, position, bldc, motors, are, typically, 85, efficient, reaching, up, to, 96, 5, while, brushed, dc, motors, are, typically, 75, 80, efficient, the, bldc, motor, s, characteristic, trapezoidal, counter, electromotive, force, cemf, waveform, is, derived, partly, from, the, stator, windings, being, evenly, distributed, and, partly, from, the, placement, of, the, rotor, s, permanent, magnets, also, known, as, electronically, commutated, dc, or, inside, out, dc, motors, the, stator, windings, of, trapezoidal, bldc, motors, can, be, single, phase, two, phase, or, three, phase, and, use, hall, effect, sensors, mounted, on, their, windings, for, rotor, position, sensing, and, low, cost, closed, loop, commutator, control, bldc, motors, are, commonly, used, where, precise, speed, control, is, necessary, as, in, computer, disk, drives, or, video, cassette, recorders, the, spindles, within, cd, cd, rom, etc, drives, and, mechanisms, within, office, products, such, as, fans, laser, printers, and, photocopiers, they, have, several, advantages, over, conventional, motors, modern, bldc, motors, range, in, power, from, a, fraction, of, a, watt, to, many, kilowatts, larger, bldc, motors, rated, up, to, about, 100, kw, are, used, in, electric, vehicles, they, also, find, use, in, electric, model, aircraft, the, switched, reluctance, motor, srm, has, no, brushes, or, permanent, magnets, and, the, rotor, has, no, electric, currents, torque, comes, from, a, slight, misalignment, of, poles, on, the, rotor, with, poles, on, the, stator, the, rotor, aligns, itself, with, the, magnetic, field, of, the, stator, while, the, stator, field, windings, are, sequentially, energized, to, rotate, the, stator, field, the, magnetic, flux, created, by, the, field, windings, follows, the, path, of, least, magnetic, sending, the, flux, through, rotor, poles, that, are, closest, to, the, energized, poles, of, the, stator, thereby, magnetizing, those, poles, of, the, rotor, and, creating, torque, as, the, rotor, turns, different, windings, are, energized, keeping, the, rotor, turning, srms, are, used, in, some, appliances, and, vehicles, a, commutated, electrically, excited, series, or, parallel, wound, motor, is, referred, to, as, a, universal, motor, because, it, can, be, designed, to, operate, on, either, ac, or, dc, power, a, universal, motor, can, operate, well, on, ac, because, the, current, in, both, the, field, and, the, armature, coils, and, hence, the, resultant, magnetic, fields, synchronously, reverse, polarity, and, hence, the, resulting, mechanical, force, occurs, in, a, constant, direction, of, rotation, operating, at, normal, power, line, frequencies, universal, motors, are, often, used, in, sub, kilowatt, applications, universal, motors, formed, the, basis, of, the, traditional, railway, traction, motor, in, electric, railways, in, this, application, using, ac, power, on, a, motor, designed, to, run, on, dc, would, experience, efficiency, losses, due, to, eddy, current, heating, of, their, magnetic, components, particularly, the, motor, field, pole, pieces, that, for, dc, would, have, used, solid, un, laminated, iron, they, are, now, rarely, used, an, advantage, is, that, ac, power, may, be, used, on, motors, that, specifically, have, high, starting, torque, and, compact, design, if, high, running, speeds, are, used, by, contrast, maintenance, is, higher, and, lifetimes, are, shortened, such, motors, are, used, in, devices, that, are, not, heavily, used, and, have, high, starting, torque, demands, multiple, taps, on, the, field, coil, provide, imprecise, stepped, speed, control, household, blenders, that, advertise, many, speeds, typically, combine, a, field, coil, with, several, taps, and, a, diode, that, can, be, inserted, in, series, with, the, motor, causing, the, motor, to, run, on, half, wave, rectified, ac, universal, motors, also, lend, themselves, to, electronic, speed, control, and, as, such, are, a, choice, for, devices, such, as, domestic, washing, machines, the, motor, can, agitate, the, drum, both, forwards, and, in, reverse, by, switching, the, field, winding, with, respect, to, the, armature, whereas, scims, cannot, turn, a, shaft, faster, than, allowed, by, the, power, line, frequency, universal, motors, can, run, at, much, higher, speeds, this, makes, them, useful, for, appliances, such, as, blenders, vacuum, cleaners, and, hair, dryers, where, high, speed, and, light, weight, are, desirable, they, are, also, commonly, used, in, portable, power, tools, such, as, drills, sanders, circular, and, jig, saws, where, the, motor, s, characteristics, work, well, many, vacuum, cleaner, and, weed, trimmer, motors, exceed, 10, 000, rpm, while, miniature, grinders, may, exceed, 30, 000, rpm, ac, induction, and, synchronous, motors, are, optimized, for, operation, on, single, phase, or, polyphase, sinusoidal, or, quasi, sinusoidal, waveform, power, such, as, supplied, for, fixed, speed, applications, by, the, ac, power, grid, or, for, variable, speed, application, from, variable, frequency, drive, vfd, controllers, an, induction, motor, is, an, asynchronous, ac, motor, where, power, is, transferred, to, the, rotor, by, electromagnetic, induction, much, like, transformer, action, an, induction, motor, resembles, a, rotating, transformer, because, the, stator, stationary, part, is, essentially, the, primary, side, of, the, transformer, and, the, rotor, rotating, part, is, the, secondary, side, polyphase, induction, motors, are, widely, used, in, industry, induction, motors, may, be, divided, into, squirrel, cage, induction, motors, scim, and, wound, rotor, induction, motors, wrim, scims, have, a, heavy, winding, made, up, of, solid, bars, usually, aluminum, or, copper, electrically, connected, by, rings, at, the, ends, of, the, rotor, the, bars, and, rings, as, a, whole, are, much, like, an, animal, s, rotating, exercise, cage, currents, induced, into, this, winding, provide, the, rotor, magnetic, field, the, shape, of, the, rotor, bars, determines, the, speed, torque, characteristics, at, low, speeds, the, current, induced, in, the, squirrel, cage, is, nearly, at, line, frequency, and, tends, to, stay, in, the, outer, parts, of, the, cage, as, the, motor, accelerates, the, slip, frequency, becomes, lower, and, more, current, reaches, the, interior, by, shaping, the, bars, to, change, the, resistance, of, the, winding, portions, in, the, interior, and, outer, parts, of, the, cage, a, variable, resistance, is, effectively, inserted, in, the, rotor, circuit, however, most, such, motors, employ, uniform, bars, in, a, wrim, the, rotor, winding, is, made, of, many, turns, of, insulated, wire, and, is, connected, to, slip, rings, on, the, motor, shaft, an, external, resistor, or, other, control, device, can, be, connected, in, the, rotor, circuit, resistors, allow, control, of, the, motor, speed, although, dissipating, significant, power, a, converter, can, be, fed, from, the, rotor, circuit, and, return, the, slip, frequency, power, that, would, otherwise, be, wasted, into, the, power, system, through, an, inverter, or, separate, motor, generator, wrims, are, used, primarily, to, start, a, high, inertia, load, or, a, load, that, requires, high, starting, torque, across, the, full, speed, range, by, correctly, selecting, the, resistors, used, in, the, secondary, resistance, or, slip, ring, starter, the, motor, is, able, to, produce, maximum, torque, at, a, relatively, low, supply, current, from, zero, speed, to, full, speed, motor, speed, can, be, changed, because, the, motor, s, torque, curve, is, effectively, modified, by, the, amount, of, resistance, connected, to, the, rotor, circuit, increasing, resistance, lowers, the, speed, of, maximum, torque, if, the, resistance, is, increased, beyond, the, point, where, the, maximum, torque, occurs, at, zero, speed, the, torque, is, further, reduced, when, used, with, a, load, that, has, a, torque, curve, that, increases, with, speed, the, motor, operates, at, the, speed, where, the, torque, developed, by, the, motor, is, equal, to, the, load, torque, reducing, the, load, causes, the, motor, to, speed, up, while, increasing, the, load, causes, the, motor, to, slow, down, until, the, load, and, motor, torque, are, again, equal, operated, in, this, manner, the, slip, losses, are, dissipated, in, the, secondary, resistors, and, can, be, significant, the, speed, regulation, and, net, efficiency, is, poor, a, torque, motor, can, operate, indefinitely, while, stalled, that, is, with, the, rotor, blocked, from, turning, without, incurring, damage, in, this, mode, of, operation, the, motor, applies, a, steady, torque, to, the, load, a, common, application, is, the, supply, and, take, up, reel, motors, in, a, tape, drive, in, this, application, driven, by, a, low, voltage, the, characteristics, of, these, motors, apply, a, steady, light, tension, to, the, tape, whether, or, not, the, capstan, is, feeding, tape, past, the, tape, heads, driven, from, a, higher, voltage, delivering, a, higher, torque, torque, motors, can, achieve, fast, forward, and, rewind, operation, without, requiring, additional, mechanics, such, as, gears, or, clutches, in, the, computer, gaming, world, torque, motors, are, used, in, force, feedback, steering, wheels, another, common, application, is, to, control, the, throttle, of, an, internal, combustion, engine, with, an, electronic, governor, the, motor, works, against, a, return, spring, to, move, the, throttle, in, accord, with, the, governor, output, the, latter, monitors, engine, speed, by, counting, electrical, pulses, from, the, ignition, system, or, from, a, magnetic, pickup, and, depending, on, the, speed, makes, small, adjustments, to, the, amount, of, current, if, the, engine, slows, down, relative, to, the, desired, speed, the, current, increases, producing, more, torque, pulling, against, the, return, spring, and, opening, the, throttle, should, the, engine, run, too, fast, the, governor, reduces, the, current, allowing, the, return, spring, to, pull, back, and, reduce, the, throttle, a, synchronous, electric, motor, is, an, ac, motor, it, includes, a, rotor, spinning, with, coils, passing, magnets, at, the, same, frequency, as, the, ac, and, produces, a, magnetic, field, to, drive, it, it, has, zero, slip, under, typical, operating, conditions, by, contrast, induction, motors, must, slip, to, produce, torque, one, type, of, synchronous, motor, is, like, an, induction, motor, except, that, the, rotor, is, excited, by, a, dc, field, slip, rings, and, brushes, conduct, current, to, the, rotor, the, rotor, poles, connect, to, each, other, and, move, at, the, same, speed, another, type, for, low, load, torque, has, flats, ground, onto, a, conventional, squirrel, cage, rotor, to, create, discrete, poles, yet, another, as, made, by, hammond, for, its, pre, world, war, ii, clocks, and, in, older, hammond, organs, has, no, rotor, windings, and, discrete, poles, it, is, not, self, starting, the, clock, requires, manual, starting, by, a, small, knob, on, the, back, while, the, older, hammond, organs, had, an, auxiliary, starting, motor, connected, by, a, spring, loaded, manually, operated, switch, hysteresis, synchronous, motors, typically, are, essentially, two, phase, motors, with, a, phase, shifting, capacitor, for, one, phase, they, start, like, induction, motors, but, when, slip, rate, decreases, sufficiently, the, rotor, a, smooth, cylinder, becomes, temporarily, magnetized, its, distributed, poles, make, it, act, like, a, permanent, magnet, synchronous, motor, the, rotor, material, like, that, of, a, common, nail, stays, magnetized, but, can, be, demagnetized, with, little, difficulty, once, running, the, rotor, poles, stay, in, place, they, do, not, drift, low, power, synchronous, timing, motors, such, as, those, for, traditional, electric, clocks, may, have, multi, pole, permanent, magnet, external, cup, rotors, and, use, shading, coils, to, provide, starting, torque, telechron, clock, motors, have, shaded, poles, for, starting, torque, and, a, two, spoke, ring, rotor, that, performs, like, a, discrete, two, pole, rotor, doubly, fed, electric, motors, have, two, independent, multiphase, winding, sets, which, contribute, active, i, e, working, power, to, the, energy, conversion, process, with, at, least, one, of, the, winding, sets, electronically, controlled, for, variable, speed, operation, two, independent, multiphase, winding, sets, i, e, dual, armature, are, the, maximum, provided, in, a, single, package, without, topology, duplication, doubly, fed, electric, motors, have, an, effective, constant, torque, speed, range, that, is, twice, synchronous, speed, for, a, given, frequency, of, excitation, this, is, twice, the, constant, torque, speed, range, as, singly, fed, electric, machines, which, have, only, one, active, winding, set, a, doubly, fed, motor, allows, for, a, smaller, electronic, converter, but, the, cost, of, the, rotor, winding, and, slip, rings, may, offset, the, saving, in, the, power, electronics, components, difficulties, affect, controlling, speed, near, synchronous, speed, limit, applications, the, coreless, or, ironless, dc, motor, is, a, specialized, permanent, magnet, dc, motor, optimized, for, rapid, acceleration, the, rotor, is, constructed, without, an, iron, core, the, rotor, can, take, the, form, of, a, winding, filled, cylinder, or, a, self, supporting, structure, comprising, only, wire, and, bonding, material, the, rotor, can, fit, inside, the, stator, magnets, a, magnetically, soft, stationary, cylinder, inside, the, rotor, provides, a, return, path, for, the, stator, magnetic, flux, a, second, arrangement, has, the, rotor, winding, basket, surrounding, the, stator, magnets, in, that, design, the, rotor, fits, inside, a, magnetically, soft, cylinder, that, can, serve, as, the, motor, housing, and, provides, a, return, path, for, the, flux, because, the, rotor, is, much, lower, mass, than, a, conventional, rotor, it, can, accelerate, much, more, rapidly, often, achieving, a, mechanical, time, constant, under, one, millisecond, this, is, especially, true, if, the, windings, use, aluminum, rather, than, heavier, copper, the, rotor, has, no, metal, mass, to, act, as, a, heat, sink, even, small, motors, must, be, cooled, overheating, can, be, an, issue, for, these, designs, the, vibrating, alert, of, cellular, phones, can, be, generated, by, cylindrical, permanent, magnet, motors, or, disc, shaped, types, that, have, a, thin, multipolar, disc, field, magnet, and, an, intentionally, unbalanced, molded, plastic, rotor, structure, with, two, bonded, coreless, coils, metal, brushes, and, a, flat, commutator, switch, power, to, the, rotor, coils, related, limited, travel, actuators, have, no, core, and, a, bonded, coil, placed, between, the, poles, of, high, flux, thin, permanent, magnets, these, are, the, fast, head, positioners, for, rigid, disk, hard, disk, drives, although, the, contemporary, design, differs, considerably, from, that, of, loudspeakers, it, is, still, loosely, and, incorrectly, referred, to, as, a, voice, coil, structure, because, some, earlier, rigid, disk, drive, heads, moved, in, straight, lines, and, had, a, drive, structure, much, like, that, of, a, loudspeaker, the, printed, armature, or, pancake, motor, has, windings, shaped, as, a, disc, running, between, arrays, of, high, flux, magnets, the, magnets, are, arranged, in, a, circle, facing, the, rotor, spaced, to, form, an, axial, air, gap, this, design, is, commonly, known, as, the, pancake, motor, because, of, its, flat, profile, the, armature, originally, formed, on, a, printed, circuit, board, is, made, from, punched, copper, sheets, that, are, laminated, together, using, advanced, composites, to, form, a, thin, rigid, disc, the, armature, does, not, have, a, separate, ring, commutator, the, brushes, move, directly, on, the, armature, surface, making, the, whole, design, compact, an, alternative, design, is, to, use, wound, copper, wire, laid, flat, with, a, central, conventional, commutator, in, a, flower, and, petal, shape, the, windings, are, typically, stabilized, with, electrical, epoxy, potting, systems, these, are, filled, epoxies, that, have, moderate, mixed, viscosity, and, a, long, gel, time, they, are, highlighted, by, low, shrinkage, and, low, exotherm, and, are, typically, ul, 1446, recognized, as, a, potting, compound, insulated, with, 180, c, 356, f, class, h, rating, the, unique, advantage, of, ironless, dc, motors, is, the, absence, of, cogging, torque, variations, caused, by, changing, attraction, between, the, iron, and, the, magnets, parasitic, eddy, currents, cannot, form, in, the, rotor, as, it, is, totally, ironless, although, iron, rotors, are, laminated, this, can, greatly, improve, efficiency, but, variable, speed, controllers, must, use, a, higher, switching, rate, 40, khz, or, dc, because, of, decreased, electromagnetic, induction, these, motors, were, invented, to, drive, the, capstan, s, of, magnetic, tape, drives, where, minimal, time, to, reach, operating, speed, and, minimal, stopping, distance, were, critical, pancake, motors, are, widely, used, in, high, performance, servo, controlled, systems, robotic, systems, industrial, automation, and, medical, devices, due, to, the, variety, of, constructions, now, available, the, technology, is, used, in, applications, from, high, temperature, military, to, low, cost, pump, and, basic, servos, another, approach, magnax, is, to, use, a, single, stator, sandwiched, between, two, rotors, one, such, design, has, produced, peak, power, of, 15, kw, kg, sustained, power, around, 7, 5, kw, kg, this, yokeless, axial, flux, motor, offers, a, shorter, flux, path, keeping, the, magnets, further, from, the, axis, the, design, allows, zero, winding, overhang, 100, percent, of, the, windings, are, active, this, is, enhanced, with, the, use, of, rectangular, crosssection, copper, wire, the, motors, can, be, stacked, to, work, in, parallel, instabilities, are, minimized, by, ensuring, that, the, two, rotor, discs, put, equal, and, opposing, forces, onto, the, stator, disc, the, rotors, are, connected, directly, to, one, another, via, a, shaft, ring, cancelling, out, the, magnetic, forces, a, servomotor, is, a, motor, that, is, used, within, a, position, control, or, speed, control, feedback, system, servomotors, are, used, in, applications, such, as, machine, tools, pen, plotters, and, other, process, systems, motors, intended, for, use, in, a, servomechanism, must, have, predictable, characteristics, for, speed, torque, and, power, the, speed, torque, curve, is, important, and, is, high, ratio, for, a, servomotor, dynamic, response, characteristics, such, as, winding, inductance, and, rotor, inertia, are, important, these, factors, limit, performance, large, powerful, but, slow, responding, servo, loops, may, use, conventional, ac, or, dc, motors, and, drive, systems, with, position, or, speed, feedback, as, dynamic, response, requirements, increase, more, specialized, motor, designs, such, as, coreless, motors, are, used, ac, motors, superior, power, density, and, acceleration, characteristics, tends, to, favor, permanent, magnet, synchronous, bldc, induction, and, srm, drive, approaches, a, servo, system, differs, from, some, stepper, motor, applications, in, that, position, feedback, is, continuous, while, the, motor, is, running, a, stepper, system, inherently, operates, open, loop, relying, on, the, motor, not, to, miss, steps, for, short, term, accuracy, with, any, feedback, such, as, a, home, switch, or, position, encoder, external, to, the, motor, system, stepper, motors, are, typically, used, to, provide, precise, rotations, an, internal, rotor, containing, permanent, magnets, or, a, magnetically, soft, rotor, with, salient, poles, is, controlled, by, a, set, of, electronically, switched, external, magnets, a, stepper, motor, may, also, be, thought, of, as, a, cross, between, a, dc, electric, motor, and, a, rotary, solenoid, as, each, coil, is, energized, in, turn, the, rotor, aligns, itself, with, the, magnetic, field, produced, by, the, energized, field, winding, unlike, a, synchronous, motor, the, stepper, motor, may, not, rotate, continuously, instead, it, moves, in, steps, starting, and, then, stopping, advancing, from, one, position, to, the, next, as, field, windings, are, energized, and, de, energized, in, sequence, depending, on, the, sequence, the, rotor, may, turn, forwards, or, backwards, and, it, may, change, direction, stop, speed, up, or, slow, down, at, any, time, simple, stepper, motor, drivers, entirely, energize, or, entirely, de, energize, the, field, windings, leading, the, rotor, to, cog, to, a, limited, number, of, positions, microstepping, drivers, can, proportionally, control, the, power, to, the, field, windings, allowing, the, rotors, to, position, between, cog, points, and, rotate, smoothly, computer, controlled, stepper, motors, are, one, of, the, most, versatile, positioning, systems, particularly, as, part, of, a, digital, servo, controlled, system, stepper, motors, can, be, rotated, to, a, specific, angle, in, discrete, steps, with, ease, and, hence, stepper, motors, are, used, for, read, write, head, positioning, in, early, disk, drives, where, the, precision, and, speed, they, offered, could, correctly, position, the, read, write, head, as, drive, density, increased, precision, and, speed, limitations, made, them, obsolete, for, hard, drives, the, precision, limitation, made, them, unusable, and, the, speed, limitation, made, them, uncompetitive, thus, newer, hard, disk, drives, use, voice, coil, based, head, actuator, systems, the, term, voice, coil, in, this, connection, is, historic, it, refers, to, the, structure, in, a, cone, type, loudspeaker, stepper, motors, are, often, used, in, computer, printers, optical, scanners, and, digital, photocopiers, to, move, the, active, element, the, print, head, carriage, inkjet, printers, and, the, platen, or, feed, rollers, so, called, quartz, analog, wristwatches, contain, the, smallest, commonplace, stepping, motors, they, have, one, coil, draw, little, power, and, have, a, permanent, magnet, rotor, the, same, kind, of, motor, drives, battery, powered, quartz, clocks, some, of, these, watches, such, as, chronographs, contain, more, than, one, stepper, motor, closely, related, in, design, to, three, phase, ac, synchronous, motors, stepper, motors, and, srms, are, classified, as, variable, reluctance, motor, type, a, linear, motor, is, essentially, any, electric, motor, that, has, been, unrolled, so, that, instead, of, producing, torque, rotation, it, produces, a, straight, line, force, along, its, length, linear, motors, are, most, commonly, induction, motors, or, stepper, motors, linear, motors, are, commonly, found, in, roller, coasters, where, the, rapid, motion, of, the, motorless, railcar, is, controlled, by, the, rail, they, are, also, used, in, maglev, trains, where, the, train, flies, over, the, ground, on, a, smaller, scale, the, 1978, era, hp, 7225a, pen, plotter, used, two, linear, stepper, motors, to, move, the, pen, along, the, x,
