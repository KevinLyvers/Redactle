an, airship, is, a, type, of, aerostat, or, lighter, than, air, aircraft, that, can, navigate, through, the, air, flying, under, its, own, power, aerostats, use, buoyancy, from, a, lifting, gas, that, is, less, dense, than, the, surrounding, air, to, achieve, the, lift, needed, to, stay, airborne, in, early, dirigibles, the, lifting, gas, used, was, hydrogen, due, to, its, high, lifting, capacity, and, ready, availability, but, the, inherent, flammability, led, to, several, fatal, accidents, that, rendered, hydrogen, airships, obsolete, the, alternative, lifting, gas, helium, gas, is, not, flammable, but, is, rare, and, relatively, expensive, significant, amounts, were, first, discovered, in, the, united, states, and, for, a, while, helium, was, only, available, for, airship, usage, in, north, america, most, airships, built, since, the, 1960s, have, used, helium, though, some, have, used, hot, air, the, envelope, of, an, airship, may, form, the, gasbag, or, it, may, contain, a, number, of, gas, filled, cells, an, airship, also, has, engines, crew, and, optionally, also, payload, accommodation, typically, housed, in, one, or, more, gondolas, suspended, below, the, envelope, the, main, types, of, airship, are, non, rigid, semi, rigid, and, rigid, airships, non, rigid, airships, often, called, blimps, rely, solely, on, internal, gas, pressure, to, maintain, the, envelope, shape, semi, rigid, airships, maintain, their, shape, by, internal, pressure, but, have, some, form, of, supporting, structure, such, as, a, fixed, keel, attached, to, it, rigid, airships, have, an, outer, structural, framework, that, maintains, the, shape, and, carries, all, structural, loads, while, the, lifting, gas, is, contained, in, one, or, more, internal, gasbags, or, cells, rigid, airships, were, first, flown, by, count, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, and, the, vast, majority, of, rigid, airships, built, were, manufactured, by, the, firm, he, founded, luftschiffbau, zeppelin, as, a, result, rigid, airships, are, often, called, zeppelins, airships, were, the, first, aircraft, capable, of, controlled, powered, flight, and, were, most, commonly, used, before, the, 1940s, their, use, decreased, as, their, capabilities, were, surpassed, by, those, of, aeroplanes, their, decline, was, accelerated, by, a, series, of, high, profile, accidents, including, the, 1930, crash, and, burning, of, the, british, r101, in, france, the, 1933, and, 1935, storm, related, crashes, of, the, twin, airborne, aircraft, carrier, u, s, navy, helium, filled, rigids, the, uss, akron, and, uss, macon, respectively, and, the, 1937, burning, of, the, german, hydrogen, filled, hindenburg, from, the, 1960s, helium, airships, have, been, used, where, the, ability, to, hover, for, a, long, time, outweighs, the, need, for, speed, and, manoeuvrability, such, as, advertising, tourism, camera, platforms, geological, surveys, and, aerial, observation, during, the, pioneer, years, of, aeronautics, terms, such, as, airship, air, ship, air, ship, and, ship, of, the, air, meant, any, kind, of, navigable, or, dirigible, flying, machine, in, 1919, frederick, handley, page, was, reported, as, referring, to, ships, of, the, air, with, smaller, passenger, types, as, air, yachts, in, the, 1930s, large, intercontinental, flying, boats, were, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, ships, of, the, air, or, flying, ships, nowadays, the, term, airship, is, used, only, for, powered, dirigible, balloons, with, sub, types, being, classified, as, rigid, semi, rigid, or, non, rigid, semi, rigid, architecture, is, the, more, recent, following, advances, in, deformable, structures, and, the, exigency, of, reducing, weight, and, volume, of, the, airships, they, have, a, minimal, structure, that, keeps, the, shape, jointly, with, overpressure, of, the, gas, envelope, an, aerostat, is, an, aircraft, that, remains, aloft, using, buoyancy, or, static, lift, as, opposed, to, the, aerodyne, which, obtains, lift, by, moving, through, the, air, airships, are, a, type, of, aerostat, the, term, aerostat, has, also, been, used, to, indicate, a, tethered, or, moored, balloon, as, opposed, to, a, free, floating, balloon, aerostats, today, are, capable, of, lifting, a, payload, of, 3, 000, pounds, 1, 400, kg, to, an, altitude, of, more, than, 4, 5, kilometres, 2, 8, mi, above, sea, level, they, can, also, stay, in, the, air, for, extended, periods, of, time, particularly, when, powered, by, an, on, board, generator, or, if, the, tether, contains, electrical, conductors, due, to, this, capability, aerostats, can, be, used, as, platforms, for, telecommunication, services, for, instance, platform, wireless, international, corporation, announced, in, 2001, that, it, would, use, a, tethered, 1, 250, pounds, 570, kg, airborne, payload, to, deliver, cellular, phone, service, to, a, 140, miles, 230, km, region, in, brazil, the, european, union, s, absolute, project, was, also, reportedly, exploring, the, use, of, tethered, aerostat, stations, to, provide, telecommunications, during, disaster, response, a, blimp, is, a, non, rigid, aerostat, in, british, usage, it, refers, to, any, non, rigid, aerostat, including, barrage, balloons, and, other, kite, balloons, having, a, streamlined, shape, and, stabilising, tail, fins, some, blimps, may, be, powered, dirigibles, as, in, early, versions, of, the, goodyear, blimp, later, goodyear, dirigibles, though, technically, semi, rigid, airships, have, still, been, called, blimps, by, the, company, the, term, zeppelin, originally, referred, to, airships, manufactured, by, the, german, zeppelin, company, which, built, and, operated, the, first, rigid, airships, in, the, early, years, of, the, twentieth, century, the, initials, lz, for, luftschiff, zeppelin, german, for, zeppelin, airship, usually, prefixed, their, craft, s, serial, identifiers, streamlined, rigid, or, semi, rigid, airships, are, often, referred, to, as, zeppelins, because, of, the, fame, that, this, company, acquired, due, to, the, number, of, airships, it, produced, although, its, early, rival, was, the, parseval, semi, rigid, design, hybrid, airships, fly, with, a, positive, aerostatic, contribution, usually, equal, to, the, empty, weight, of, the, system, and, the, variable, payload, is, sustained, by, propulsion, or, aerodynamic, contribution, airships, are, classified, according, to, their, method, of, construction, into, rigid, semi, rigid, and, non, rigid, types, a, rigid, airship, has, a, rigid, framework, covered, by, an, outer, skin, or, envelope, the, interior, contains, one, or, more, gasbags, cells, or, balloons, to, provide, lift, rigid, airships, are, typically, unpressurised, and, can, be, made, to, virtually, any, size, most, but, not, all, of, the, german, zeppelin, airships, have, been, of, this, type, a, semi, rigid, airship, has, some, kind, of, supporting, structure, but, the, main, envelope, is, held, in, shape, by, the, internal, pressure, of, the, lifting, gas, typically, the, airship, has, an, extended, usually, articulated, keel, running, along, the, bottom, of, the, envelope, to, stop, it, kinking, in, the, middle, by, distributing, suspension, loads, into, the, envelope, while, also, allowing, lower, envelope, pressures, non, rigid, airships, are, often, called, blimps, most, but, not, all, of, the, american, goodyear, airships, have, been, blimps, a, non, rigid, airship, relies, entirely, on, internal, gas, pressure, to, retain, its, shape, during, flight, unlike, the, rigid, design, the, non, rigid, airship, s, gas, envelope, has, no, compartments, however, it, still, typically, has, smaller, internal, bags, containing, air, ballonets, as, altitude, is, increased, the, lifting, gas, expands, and, air, from, the, ballonets, is, expelled, through, valves, to, maintain, the, hull, s, shape, to, return, to, sea, level, the, process, is, reversed, air, is, forced, back, into, the, ballonets, by, scooping, air, from, the, engine, exhaust, and, using, auxiliary, blowers, the, envelope, itself, is, the, structure, including, textiles, that, contain, the, buoyant, gas, internally, two, ballonets, are, generally, placed, in, the, front, part, and, in, the, rear, part, of, the, hull, and, contains, air, the, problem, of, the, exact, determination, of, the, pressure, on, an, airship, envelope, is, still, problematic, and, has, fascinated, major, scientists, such, as, theodor, von, karman, a, few, airships, have, been, metal, clad, with, rigid, and, nonrigid, examples, made, each, kind, used, a, thin, gastight, metal, envelope, rather, than, the, usual, rubber, coated, fabric, envelope, only, four, metal, clad, ships, are, known, to, have, been, built, and, only, two, actually, flew, schwarz, s, first, aluminum, rigid, airship, of, 1893, collapsed, while, his, second, flew, the, nonrigid, zmc, 2, built, for, the, u, s, navy, flew, from, 1929, to, 1941, when, it, was, scrapped, as, too, small, for, operational, use, on, anti, submarine, patrols, while, the, 1929, nonrigid, slate, aircraft, corporation, city, of, glendale, collapsed, on, its, first, flight, attempt, a, ballonet, is, an, air, bag, inside, the, outer, envelope, of, an, airship, which, when, inflated, reduces, the, volume, available, for, the, lifting, gas, making, it, more, dense, because, air, is, also, denser, than, the, lifting, gas, inflating, the, ballonet, reduces, the, overall, lift, while, deflating, it, increases, lift, in, this, way, the, ballonet, can, be, used, to, adjust, the, lift, as, required, by, controlling, the, buoyancy, by, inflating, or, deflating, ballonets, strategically, the, pilot, can, control, the, airship, s, altitude, and, attitude, ballonets, may, typically, be, used, in, non, rigid, or, semi, rigid, airships, commonly, with, multiple, ballonets, located, both, fore, and, aft, to, maintain, balance, and, to, control, the, pitch, of, the, airship, lifting, gas, is, generally, hydrogen, helium, or, hot, air, hydrogen, gives, the, highest, lift, 1, 1, kg, m, 3, 0, 069, lb, cu, ft, and, is, inexpensive, and, easily, obtained, but, is, highly, flammable, and, can, detonate, if, mixed, with, air, helium, is, completely, non, flammable, but, gives, lower, performance, 1, 02, kg, m, 3, 0, 064, lb, cu, ft, and, is, a, rare, element, and, much, more, expensive, thermal, airships, use, a, heated, lifting, gas, usually, air, in, a, fashion, similar, to, hot, air, balloons, the, first, to, do, so, was, flown, in, 1973, by, the, british, company, cameron, balloons, small, airships, carry, their, engine, s, in, their, gondola, where, there, were, multiple, engines, on, larger, airships, these, were, placed, in, separate, nacelles, termed, power, cars, or, engine, cars, to, allow, asymmetric, thrust, to, be, applied, for, maneuvering, these, power, cars, were, mounted, towards, the, sides, of, the, envelope, away, from, the, centre, line, gondola, this, also, raised, them, above, the, ground, reducing, the, risk, of, a, propeller, strike, when, landing, widely, spaced, power, cars, were, also, termed, wing, cars, from, the, use, of, wing, to, mean, being, on, the, side, of, something, as, in, a, theater, rather, than, the, aerodynamic, device, these, engine, cars, carried, a, crew, during, flight, who, maintained, the, engines, as, needed, but, who, also, worked, the, engine, controls, throttle, etc, mounted, directly, on, the, engine, instructions, were, relayed, to, them, from, the, pilot, s, station, by, a, telegraph, system, as, on, a, ship, if, fuel, is, burnt, for, propulsion, then, progressive, reduction, in, the, airship, s, overall, weight, occurs, in, hydrogen, airships, this, is, usually, dealt, with, by, simply, venting, cheap, hydrogen, lifting, gas, in, helium, airships, water, is, often, condensed, from, the, exhaust, and, stored, as, ballast, to, control, the, airship, s, direction, and, stability, it, is, equipped, with, fins, and, rudders, fins, are, typically, located, on, the, tail, section, and, provide, stability, and, resistance, to, rolling, rudders, are, movable, surfaces, on, the, tail, that, allow, the, pilot, to, steer, the, airship, left, or, right, the, empennage, refers, to, the, tail, section, of, the, airship, which, includes, the, fins, rudders, and, other, aerodynamic, surfaces, it, plays, a, crucial, role, in, maintaining, stability, and, controlling, the, airship, s, attitude, airships, require, a, source, of, power, to, operate, their, propulsion, systems, this, includes, engines, generators, or, batteries, depending, on, the, type, of, airship, and, its, design, fuel, tanks, or, batteries, are, typically, located, within, the, envelope, or, gondola, to, navigate, safely, and, communicate, with, ground, control, or, other, aircraft, airships, are, equipped, with, a, range, of, instruments, including, gps, systems, radios, radar, and, navigation, lights, some, airships, have, landing, gear, that, allows, them, to, land, on, runways, or, other, surfaces, this, landing, gear, may, include, wheels, skids, or, landing, pads, the, main, advantage, of, airships, with, respect, to, any, other, vehicle, is, that, they, require, less, energy, to, remain, in, flight, compared, to, other, air, vehicles, the, proposed, varialift, airship, powered, by, a, mixture, of, solar, powered, engines, and, conventional, jet, engines, would, use, only, an, estimated, 8, percent, of, the, fuel, required, by, jet, aircraft, furthermore, utilizing, the, jet, stream, could, allow, for, a, faster, and, more, energy, efficient, cargo, transport, alternative, to, maritime, shipping, this, is, one, of, the, reasons, why, china, has, embraced, their, use, recently, in, 1670, the, jesuit, father, francesco, lana, de, terzi, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, father, of, aeronautics, published, a, description, of, an, aerial, ship, supported, by, four, copper, spheres, from, which, the, air, was, evacuated, although, the, basic, principle, is, sound, such, a, craft, was, unrealizable, then, and, remains, so, to, the, present, day, since, external, air, pressure, would, cause, the, spheres, to, collapse, unless, their, thickness, was, such, as, to, make, them, too, heavy, to, be, buoyant, a, hypothetical, craft, constructed, using, this, principle, is, known, as, a, vacuum, airship, in, 1709, the, brazilian, portuguese, jesuit, priest, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, made, a, hot, air, balloon, the, passarola, ascend, to, the, skies, before, an, astonished, portuguese, court, it, would, have, been, on, august, 8, 1709, when, father, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, held, in, the, courtyard, of, the, casa, da, ndia, in, the, city, of, lisbon, the, first, passarola, demonstration, the, balloon, caught, fire, without, leaving, the, ground, but, in, a, second, demonstration, it, rose, to, 95, meters, in, height, it, was, a, small, balloon, of, thick, brown, paper, filled, with, hot, air, produced, by, the, fire, of, material, contained, in, a, clay, bowl, embedded, in, the, base, of, a, waxed, wooden, tray, the, event, was, witnessed, by, king, john, v, of, portugal, and, the, future, pope, innocent, xiii, a, more, practical, dirigible, airship, was, described, by, lieutenant, jean, baptiste, marie, meusnier, in, a, paper, entitled, m, moire, sur, l, quilibre, des, machines, a, rostatiques, memorandum, on, the, equilibrium, of, aerostatic, machines, presented, to, the, french, academy, on, 3, december, 1783, the, 16, water, color, drawings, published, the, following, year, depict, a, 260, foot, long, 79, m, streamlined, envelope, with, internal, ballonets, that, could, be, used, for, regulating, lift, this, was, attached, to, a, long, carriage, that, could, be, used, as, a, boat, if, the, vehicle, was, forced, to, land, in, water, the, airship, was, designed, to, be, driven, by, three, propellers, and, steered, with, a, sail, like, aft, rudder, in, 1784, jean, pierre, blanchard, fitted, a, hand, powered, propeller, to, a, balloon, the, first, recorded, means, of, propulsion, carried, aloft, in, 1785, he, crossed, the, english, channel, in, a, balloon, equipped, with, flapping, wings, for, propulsion, and, a, birdlike, tail, for, steering, the, 19th, century, saw, continued, attempts, to, add, methods, of, propulsion, to, balloons, rufus, porter, built, and, flew, scale, models, of, his, aerial, locomotive, but, never, a, successful, full, size, implementation, the, australian, william, bland, sent, designs, for, his, atmotic, airship, to, the, great, exhibition, held, in, london, in, 1851, where, a, model, was, displayed, this, was, an, elongated, balloon, with, a, steam, engine, driving, twin, propellers, suspended, underneath, the, lift, of, the, balloon, was, estimated, as, 5, tons, and, the, car, with, the, fuel, as, weighing, 3, 5, tons, giving, a, payload, of, 1, 5, tons, bland, believed, that, the, machine, could, be, driven, at, 80, km, h, 50, mph, and, could, fly, from, sydney, to, london, in, less, than, a, week, in, 1852, henri, giffard, became, the, first, person, to, make, an, engine, powered, flight, when, he, flew, 27, km, 17, mi, in, a, steam, powered, airship, airships, would, develop, considerably, over, the, next, two, decades, in, 1863, solomon, andrews, flew, his, aereon, design, an, unpowered, controllable, dirigible, in, perth, amboy, new, jersey, and, offered, the, device, to, the, u, s, military, during, the, civil, war, he, flew, a, later, design, in, 1866, around, new, york, city, and, as, far, as, oyster, bay, new, york, this, concept, used, changes, in, lift, to, provide, propulsive, force, and, did, not, need, a, powerplant, in, 1872, the, french, naval, architect, dupuy, de, lome, launched, a, large, navigable, balloon, which, was, driven, by, a, large, propeller, turned, by, eight, men, it, was, developed, during, the, franco, prussian, war, and, was, intended, as, an, improvement, to, the, balloons, used, for, communications, between, paris, and, the, countryside, during, the, siege, of, paris, but, was, completed, only, after, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1872, paul, haenlein, flew, an, airship, with, an, internal, combustion, engine, running, on, the, coal, gas, used, to, inflate, the, envelope, the, first, use, of, such, an, engine, to, power, an, aircraft, charles, f, ritchel, made, a, public, demonstration, flight, in, 1878, of, his, hand, powered, one, man, rigid, airship, and, went, on, to, build, and, sell, five, of, his, aircraft, in, 1874, micajah, clark, dyer, filed, u, s, patent, 154, 654, apparatus, for, navigating, the, air, it, is, believed, successful, trial, flights, were, made, between, 1872, and, 1874, but, detailed, dates, are, not, available, the, apparatus, used, a, combination, of, wings, and, paddle, wheels, for, navigation, and, propulsion, in, operating, the, machinery, the, wings, receive, an, upward, and, downward, motion, in, the, manner, of, the, wings, of, a, bird, the, outer, ends, yielding, as, they, are, raised, but, opening, out, and, then, remaining, rigid, while, being, depressed, the, wings, if, desired, may, be, set, at, an, angle, so, as, to, propel, forward, as, well, as, to, raise, the, machine, in, the, air, the, paddle, wheels, are, intended, to, be, used, for, propelling, the, machine, in, the, same, way, that, a, vessel, is, propelled, in, water, an, instrument, answering, to, a, rudder, is, attached, for, guiding, the, machine, a, balloon, is, to, be, used, for, elevating, the, flying, ship, after, which, it, is, to, be, guided, and, controlled, at, the, pleasure, of, its, occupants, more, details, can, be, found, in, the, book, about, his, life, in, 1883, the, first, electric, powered, flight, was, made, by, gaston, tissandier, who, fitted, a, 1, 5, hp, 1, 1, kw, siemens, electric, motor, to, an, airship, the, first, fully, controllable, free, flight, was, made, in, 1884, by, charles, renard, and, arthur, constantin, krebs, in, the, french, army, airship, la, france, la, france, made, the, first, flight, of, an, airship, that, landed, where, it, took, off, the, 170, ft, 52, m, long, 66, 000, cu, ft, 1, 900, m, 3, airship, covered, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, in, 23, minutes, with, the, aid, of, an, 8, 5, hp, 6, 3, kw, electric, motor, and, a, 435, kg, 959, lb, battery, it, made, seven, flights, in, 1884, and, 1885, in, 1888, the, design, of, the, campbell, air, ship, designed, by, professor, peter, c, campbell, was, built, by, the, novelty, air, ship, company, it, was, lost, at, sea, in, 1889, while, being, flown, by, professor, hogan, during, an, exhibition, flight, from, 1888, to, 1897, friedrich, w, lfert, built, three, airships, powered, by, daimler, motoren, gesellschaft, built, petrol, engines, the, last, of, which, deutschland, caught, fire, in, flight, and, killed, both, occupants, in, 1897, the, 1888, version, used, a, 2, hp, 1, 5, kw, single, cylinder, daimler, engine, and, flew, 10, km, 6, mi, from, canstatt, to, kornwestheim, in, 1897, an, airship, with, an, aluminum, envelope, was, built, by, the, hungarian, croatian, engineer, david, schwarz, it, made, its, first, flight, at, tempelhof, field, in, berlin, after, schwarz, had, died, his, widow, melanie, schwarz, was, paid, 15, 000, marks, by, count, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, to, release, the, industrialist, carl, berg, from, his, exclusive, contract, to, supply, schwartz, with, aluminium, from, 1897, to, 1899, konstantin, danilewsky, medical, doctor, and, inventor, from, kharkiv, now, ukraine, then, russian, empire, built, four, muscle, powered, airships, of, gas, volume, 150, 180, m, 3, 5, 300, 6, 400, cu, ft, about, 200, ascents, were, made, within, a, framework, of, experimental, flight, program, at, two, locations, with, no, significant, incidents, in, july, 1900, the, luftschiff, zeppelin, lz1, made, its, first, flight, this, led, to, the, most, successful, airships, of, all, time, the, zeppelins, named, after, count, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, who, began, working, on, rigid, airship, designs, in, the, 1890s, leading, to, the, flawed, lz1, in, 1900, and, the, more, successful, lz2, in, 1906, the, zeppelin, airships, had, a, framework, composed, of, triangular, lattice, girders, covered, with, fabric, that, contained, separate, gas, cells, at, first, multiplane, tail, surfaces, were, used, for, control, and, stability, later, designs, had, simpler, cruciform, tail, surfaces, the, engines, and, crew, were, accommodated, in, gondolas, hung, beneath, the, hull, driving, propellers, attached, to, the, sides, of, the, frame, by, means, of, long, drive, shafts, additionally, there, was, a, passenger, compartment, later, a, bomb, bay, located, halfway, between, the, two, engine, compartments, alberto, santos, dumont, was, a, wealthy, young, brazilian, who, lived, in, france, and, had, a, passion, for, flying, he, designed, 18, balloons, and, dirigibles, before, turning, his, attention, to, fixed, winged, aircraft, on, 19, october, 1901, he, flew, his, airship, number, 6, from, the, parc, saint, cloud, to, and, around, the, eiffel, tower, and, back, in, under, thirty, minutes, this, feat, earned, him, the, deutsch, de, la, meurthe, prize, of, 100, 000, francs, many, inventors, were, inspired, by, santos, dumont, s, small, airships, many, airship, pioneers, such, as, the, american, thomas, scott, baldwin, financed, their, activities, through, passenger, flights, and, public, demonstration, flights, stanley, spencer, built, the, first, british, airship, with, funds, from, advertising, baby, food, on, the, sides, of, the, envelope, others, such, as, walter, wellman, and, melvin, vaniman, set, their, sights, on, loftier, goals, attempting, two, polar, flights, in, 1907, and, 1909, and, two, trans, atlantic, flights, in, 1910, and, 1912, in, 1902, the, spanish, engineer, leonardo, torres, quevedo, published, details, of, an, innovative, airship, design, in, spain, and, france, titled, perfectionnements, aux, aerostats, dirigibles, improvements, in, dirigible, aerostats, with, a, non, rigid, body, and, internal, bracing, wires, it, overcame, the, flaws, of, these, types, of, aircraft, as, regards, both, rigid, structure, zeppelin, type, and, flexibility, providing, the, airships, with, more, stability, during, flight, and, the, capability, of, using, heavier, engines, and, a, greater, passenger, load, a, system, called, auto, rigid, in, 1905, helped, by, captain, a, kindel, n, he, built, the, airship, torres, quevedo, at, the, guadalajara, military, base, in, 1909, he, patented, an, improved, design, that, he, offered, to, the, french, astra, company, who, started, mass, producing, it, in, 1911, as, the, astra, torres, airship, this, type, of, envelope, was, employed, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, coastal, c, star, and, north, sea, airships, the, distinctive, three, lobed, design, was, widely, used, during, the, great, war, by, the, entente, powers, for, diverse, tasks, principally, convoy, protection, and, anti, submarine, warfare, the, success, during, the, war, even, drew, the, attention, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, who, acquired, a, model, in, 1922, torres, also, drew, up, designs, of, a, docking, station, and, made, alterations, to, airship, designs, to, find, a, resolution, to, the, slew, of, problems, faced, by, airship, engineers, to, dock, dirigibles, in, 1910, he, proposed, the, idea, of, attaching, an, airships, nose, to, a, mooring, mast, and, allowing, the, airship, to, weathervane, with, changes, of, wind, direction, the, use, of, a, metal, column, erected, on, the, ground, the, top, of, which, the, bow, or, stem, would, be, directly, attached, to, by, a, cable, would, allow, a, dirigible, to, be, moored, at, any, time, in, the, open, regardless, of, wind, speeds, additionally, torres, design, called, for, the, improvement, and, accessibility, of, temporary, landing, sites, where, airships, were, to, be, moored, for, the, purpose, of, disembarkation, of, passengers, the, final, patent, was, presented, in, february, 1911, in, belgium, and, later, to, france, and, the, united, kingdom, in, 1912, under, the, title, improvements, in, mooring, arrengements, for, airships, other, airship, builders, were, also, active, before, the, war, from, 1902, the, french, company, lebaudy, fr, res, specialized, in, semirigid, airships, such, as, the, patrie, and, the, r, publique, designed, by, their, engineer, henri, julliot, who, later, worked, for, the, american, company, goodrich, the, german, firm, sch, tte, lanz, built, the, wooden, framed, sl, series, from, 1911, introducing, important, technical, innovations, another, german, firm, luft, fahrzeug, gesellschaft, built, the, parseval, luftschiff, pl, series, from, 1909, and, italian, enrico, forlanini, s, firm, had, built, and, flown, the, first, two, forlanini, airships, on, may, 12, 1902, the, inventor, and, brazilian, aeronaut, augusto, severo, de, albuquerque, maranhao, and, his, french, mechanic, georges, sach, died, when, they, were, flying, over, paris, in, the, airship, called, pax, a, marble, plaque, at, number, 81, of, the, avenue, du,

by, georges, m, li, s, in, britain, the, army, built, their, first, dirigible, the, nulli, secundus, in, 1907, the, navy, ordered, the, construction, of, an, experimental, rigid, in, 1908, officially, known, as, his, majesty, s, airship, no, 1, and, nicknamed, the, mayfly, it, broke, its, back, in, 1911, before, making, a, single, flight, work, on, a, successor, did, not, start, until, 1913, german, airship, passenger, service, known, as, delag, deutsche, luftschiffahrts, ag, was, established, in, 1910, in, 1910, walter, wellman, unsuccessfully, attempted, an, aerial, crossing, of, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, airship, america, the, prospect, of, airships, as, bombers, had, been, recognized, in, europe, well, before, the, airships, were, up, to, the, task, h, g, wells, the, war, in, the, air, 1908, described, the, obliteration, of, entire, fleets, and, cities, by, airship, attack, the, italian, forces, became, the, first, to, use, dirigibles, for, a, military, purpose, during, the, italo, turkish, war, the, first, bombing, mission, being, flown, on, 10, march, 1912, world, war, i, marked, the, airship, s, real, debut, as, a, weapon, the, germans, french, and, italians, all, used, airships, for, scouting, and, tactical, bombing, roles, early, in, the, war, and, all, learned, that, the, airship, was, too, vulnerable, for, operations, over, the, front, the, decision, to, end, operations, in, direct, support, of, armies, was, made, by, all, in, 1917, many, in, the, german, military, believed, they, had, found, the, ideal, weapon, with, which, to, counteract, british, naval, superiority, and, strike, at, britain, itself, while, more, realistic, airship, advocates, believed, the, zeppelin, s, value, was, as, a, long, range, scout, attack, craft, for, naval, operations, raids, on, england, began, in, january, 1915, and, peaked, in, 1916, following, losses, to, the, british, defenses, only, a, few, raids, were, made, in, 1917, 18, the, last, in, august, 1918, zeppelins, proved, to, be, terrifying, but, inaccurate, weapons, navigation, target, selection, and, bomb, aiming, proved, to, be, difficult, under, the, best, of, conditions, and, the, cloud, cover, that, was, frequently, encountered, by, the, airships, reduced, accuracy, even, further, the, physical, damage, done, by, airships, over, the, course, of, the, war, was, insignificant, and, the, deaths, that, they, caused, amounted, to, a, few, hundred, nevertheless, the, raid, caused, a, significant, diversion, of, british, resources, to, defense, efforts, the, airships, were, initially, immune, to, attack, by, aircraft, and, anti, aircraft, guns, as, the, pressure, in, their, envelopes, was, only, just, higher, than, ambient, air, holes, had, little, effect, but, following, the, introduction, of, a, combination, of, incendiary, and, explosive, ammunition, in, 1916, their, flammable, hydrogen, lifting, gas, made, them, vulnerable, to, the, defending, aeroplanes, several, were, shot, down, in, flames, by, british, defenders, and, many, others, destroyed, in, accidents, new, designs, capable, of, reaching, greater, altitude, were, developed, but, although, this, made, them, immune, from, attack, it, made, their, bombing, accuracy, even, worse, countermeasures, by, the, british, included, sound, detection, equipment, searchlights, and, anti, aircraft, artillery, followed, by, night, fighters, in, 1915, one, tactic, used, early, in, the, war, when, their, limited, range, meant, the, airships, had, to, fly, from, forward, bases, and, the, only, zeppelin, production, facilities, were, in, friedrichshafen, was, the, bombing, of, airship, sheds, by, the, british, royal, naval, air, service, later, in, the, war, the, development, of, the, aircraft, carrier, led, to, the, first, successful, carrier, based, air, strike, in, history, on, the, morning, of, 19, july, 1918, seven, sopwith, 2f, 1, camels, were, launched, from, hms, furious, and, struck, the, airship, base, at, t, nder, destroying, zeppelins, l, 54, and, l, 60, the, british, army, had, abandoned, airship, development, in, favour, of, aeroplanes, before, the, start, of, the, war, but, the, royal, navy, had, recognized, the, need, for, small, airships, to, counteract, the, submarine, and, mine, threat, in, coastal, waters, beginning, in, february, 1915, they, began, to, develop, the, ss, sea, scout, class, of, blimp, these, had, a, small, envelope, of, 1, 699, 1, 982, m, 3, 60, 000, 70, 000, cu, ft, and, at, first, used, aircraft, fuselages, without, the, wing, and, tail, surfaces, as, control, cars, later, more, advanced, blimps, with, purpose, built, gondolas, were, used, the, ns, class, north, sea, were, the, largest, and, most, effective, non, rigid, airships, in, british, service, with, a, gas, capacity, of, 10, 200, m, 3, 360, 000, cu, ft, a, crew, of, 10, and, an, endurance, of, 24, hours, six, 230, lb, 100, kg, bombs, were, carried, as, well, as, three, to, five, machine, guns, british, blimps, were, used, for, scouting, mine, clearance, and, convoy, patrol, duties, during, the, war, the, british, operated, over, 200, non, rigid, airships, several, were, sold, to, russia, france, the, united, states, and, italy, the, large, number, of, trained, crews, low, attrition, rate, and, constant, experimentation, in, handling, techniques, meant, that, at, the, war, s, end, britain, was, the, world, leader, in, non, rigid, airship, technology, the, royal, navy, continued, development, of, rigid, airships, until, the, end, of, the, war, eight, rigid, airships, had, been, completed, by, the, armistice, no, 9r, four, 23, class, two, r23x, class, and, one, r31, class, although, several, more, were, in, an, advanced, state, of, completion, by, the, war, s, end, both, france, and, italy, continued, to, use, airships, throughout, the, war, france, preferred, the, non, rigid, type, whereas, italy, flew, 49, semi, rigid, airships, in, both, the, scouting, and, bombing, roles, aeroplanes, had, almost, entirely, replaced, airships, as, bombers, by, the, end, of, the, war, and, germany, s, remaining, zeppelins, were, destroyed, by, their, crews, scrapped, or, handed, over, to, the, allied, powers, as, war, reparations, the, british, rigid, airship, program, which, had, mainly, been, a, reaction, to, the, potential, threat, of, the, german, airships, was, wound, down, britain, the, united, states, and, germany, built, rigid, airships, between, the, two, world, wars, italy, and, france, made, limited, use, of, zeppelins, handed, over, as, war, reparations, italy, the, soviet, union, the, united, states, and, japan, mainly, operated, semi, rigid, airships, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, germany, was, not, allowed, to, build, airships, of, greater, capacity, than, a, million, cubic, feet, two, small, passenger, airships, lz, 120, bodensee, and, its, sister, ship, lz, 121, nordstern, were, built, immediately, after, the, war, but, were, confiscated, following, the, sabotage, of, the, wartime, zeppelins, that, were, to, have, been, handed, over, as, war, reparations, bodensee, was, given, to, italy, and, nordstern, to, france, on, may, 12, 1926, the, italian, built, semi, rigid, airship, norge, was, the, first, aircraft, to, fly, over, the, north, pole, the, british, r33, and, r34, were, near, identical, copies, of, the, german, l, 33, which, had, come, down, almost, intact, in, yorkshire, on, 24, september, 1916, despite, being, almost, three, years, out, of, date, by, the, time, they, were, launched, in, 1919, they, became, two, of, the, most, successful, airships, in, british, service, the, creation, of, the, royal, air, force, raf, in, early, 1918, created, a, hybrid, british, airship, program, the, raf, was, not, interested, in, airships, while, the, admiralty, was, so, a, deal, was, made, where, the, admiralty, would, design, any, future, military, airships, and, the, raf, would, handle, manpower, facilities, and, operations, on, 2, july, 1919, r34, began, the, first, double, crossing, of, the, atlantic, by, an, aircraft, it, landed, at, mineola, long, island, on, 6, july, after, 108, hours, in, the, air, the, return, crossing, began, on, 8, july, and, took, 75, hours, this, feat, failed, to, generate, enthusiasm, for, continued, airship, development, and, the, british, airship, program, was, rapidly, wound, down, during, world, war, i, the, u, s, navy, acquired, its, first, airship, the, dh, 1, but, it, was, destroyed, while, being, inflated, shortly, after, delivery, to, the, navy, after, the, war, the, u, s, navy, contracted, to, buy, the, r, 38, which, was, being, built, in, britain, but, before, it, was, handed, over, it, was, destroyed, because, of, a, structural, failure, during, a, test, flight, america, then, started, constructing, the, uss, shenandoah, designed, by, the, bureau, of, aeronautics, and, based, on, the, zeppelin, l, 49, assembled, in, hangar, no, 1, and, first, flown, on, 4, september, 1923, at, lakehurst, new, jersey, it, was, the, first, airship, to, be, inflated, with, the, noble, gas, helium, which, was, then, so, scarce, that, the, shenandoah, contained, most, of, the, world, s, supply, a, second, airship, uss, los, angeles, was, built, by, the, zeppelin, company, as, compensation, for, the, airships, that, should, have, been, handed, over, as, war, reparations, according, to, the, terms, of, the, versailles, treaty, but, had, been, sabotaged, by, their, crews, this, construction, order, saved, the, zeppelin, works, from, the, threat, of, closure, the, success, of, the, los, angeles, which, was, flown, successfully, for, eight, years, encouraged, the, u, s, navy, to, invest, in, its, own, larger, airships, when, the, los, angeles, was, delivered, the, two, airships, had, to, share, the, limited, supply, of, helium, and, thus, alternated, operating, and, overhauls, in, 1922, sir, dennistoun, burney, suggested, a, plan, for, a, subsidised, air, service, throughout, the, british, empire, using, airships, the, burney, scheme, following, the, coming, to, power, of, ramsay, macdonald, s, labour, government, in, 1924, the, scheme, was, transformed, into, the, imperial, airship, scheme, under, which, two, airships, were, built, one, by, a, private, company, and, the, other, by, the, royal, airship, works, under, air, ministry, control, the, two, designs, were, radically, different, the, capitalist, ship, the, r100, was, more, conventional, while, the, socialist, ship, the, r101, had, many, innovative, design, features, construction, of, both, took, longer, than, expected, and, the, airships, did, not, fly, until, 1929, neither, airship, was, capable, of, the, service, intended, though, the, r100, did, complete, a, proving, flight, to, canada, and, back, in, 1930, on, 5, october, 1930, the, r101, which, had, not, been, thoroughly, tested, after, major, modifications, crashed, on, its, maiden, voyage, to, india, at, beauvais, in, france, killing, 48, of, the, 54, people, aboard, among, the, dead, were, the, craft, s, chief, designer, and, the, secretary, of, state, for, air, the, disaster, ended, british, interest, in, airships, the, locarno, treaties, of, 1925, lifted, the, restrictions, on, german, airship, construction, and, the, zeppelin, company, started, construction, of, the, graf, zeppelin, lz, 127, the, largest, airship, that, could, be, built, in, the, company, s, existing, shed, and, intended, to, stimulate, interest, in, passenger, airships, the, graf, zeppelin, burned, blau, gas, similar, to, propane, stored, in, large, gas, bags, below, the, hydrogen, cells, as, fuel, since, its, density, was, similar, to, that, of, air, it, avoided, the, weight, change, as, fuel, was, used, and, thus, the, need, to, valve, hydrogen, the, graf, zeppelin, had, an, impressive, safety, record, flying, over, 1, 600, 000, km, 990, 000, mi, including, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, by, airship, without, a, single, passenger, injury, the, u, s, navy, experimented, with, the, use, of, airships, as, airborne, aircraft, carriers, developing, an, idea, pioneered, by, the, british, the, uss, los, angeles, was, used, for, initial, experiments, and, the, uss, akron, and, macon, the, world, s, largest, at, the, time, were, used, to, test, the, principle, in, naval, operations, each, carried, four, f9c, sparrowhawk, fighters, in, its, hangar, and, could, carry, a, fifth, on, the, trapeze, the, idea, had, mixed, results, by, the, time, the, navy, started, to, develop, a, sound, doctrine, for, using, the, zrs, type, airships, the, last, of, the, two, built, uss, macon, had, been, wrecked, meanwhile, the, seaplane, had, become, more, capable, and, was, considered, a, better, investment, eventually, the, u, s, navy, lost, all, three, u, s, built, rigid, airships, to, accidents, uss, shenandoah, flew, into, a, severe, thunderstorm, over, noble, county, ohio, while, on, a, poorly, planned, publicity, flight, on, 3, september, 1925, it, broke, into, pieces, killing, 14, of, its, crew, uss, akron, was, caught, in, a, severe, storm, and, flown, into, the, surface, of, the, sea, off, the, shore, of, new, jersey, on, 3, april, 1933, it, carried, no, life, boats, and, few, life, vests, so, 73, of, its, crew, of, 76, died, from, drowning, or, hypothermia, uss, macon, was, lost, after, suffering, a, structural, failure, offshore, near, point, sur, lighthouse, on, 12, february, 1935, the, failure, caused, a, loss, of, gas, which, was, made, much, worse, when, the, aircraft, was, driven, over, pressure, height, causing, it, to, lose, too, much, helium, to, maintain, flight, only, two, of, its, crew, of, 83, died, in, the, crash, thanks, to, the, inclusion, of, life, jackets, and, inflatable, rafts, after, the, akron, disaster, the, empire, state, building, was, completed, in, 1931, with, a, dirigible, mast, in, anticipation, of, future, passenger, airship, service, but, no, airship, ever, used, the, mast, various, entrepreneurs, experimented, with, commuting, and, shipping, freight, via, airship, in, the, 1930s, the, german, zeppelins, successfully, competed, with, other, means, of, transport, they, could, carry, significantly, more, passengers, than, other, contemporary, aircraft, while, providing, amenities, similar, to, those, on, ocean, liners, such, as, private, cabins, observation, decks, and, dining, rooms, less, importantly, the, technology, was, potentially, more, energy, efficient, than, heavier, than, air, designs, zeppelins, were, also, faster, than, ocean, liners, on, the, other, hand, operating, airships, was, quite, involved, often, the, crew, would, outnumber, passengers, and, on, the, ground, large, teams, were, necessary, to, assist, mooring, and, very, large, hangars, were, required, at, airports, by, the, mid, 1930s, only, germany, still, pursued, airship, development, the, zeppelin, company, continued, to, operate, the, graf, zeppelin, on, passenger, service, between, frankfurt, and, recife, in, brazil, taking, 68, hours, even, with, the, small, graf, zeppelin, the, operation, was, almost, profitable, in, the, mid, 1930s, work, began, on, an, airship, designed, specifically, to, operate, a, passenger, service, across, the, atlantic, the, hindenburg, lz, 129, completed, a, successful, 1936, season, carrying, passengers, between, lakehurst, new, jersey, and, germany, the, year, 1937, started, with, the, most, spectacular, and, widely, remembered, airship, accident, approaching, the, lakehurst, mooring, mast, minutes, before, landing, on, 6, may, 1937, the, hindenburg, suddenly, burst, into, flames, and, crashed, to, the, ground, of, the, 97, people, aboard, 35, died, 13, passengers, 22, aircrew, along, with, one, american, ground, crewman, the, disaster, happened, before, a, large, crowd, was, filmed, and, a, radio, news, reporter, was, recording, the, arrival, this, was, a, disaster, that, theater, goers, could, see, and, hear, in, newsreels, the, hindenburg, disaster, shattered, public, confidence, in, airships, and, brought, a, definitive, end, to, their, golden, age, the, day, after, the, hindenburg, disaster, the, graf, zeppelin, landed, safely, in, germany, after, its, return, flight, from, brazil, this, was, the, last, international, passenger, airship, flight, hindenburg, s, identical, sister, ship, the, graf, zeppelin, ii, lz, 130, could, not, carry, commercial, passengers, without, helium, which, the, united, states, refused, to, sell, to, germany, the, graf, zeppelin, made, several, test, flights, and, conducted, some, electronic, espionage, until, 1939, when, it, was, grounded, due, to, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, two, graf, zeppelins, were, scrapped, in, april, 1940, development, of, airships, continued, only, in, the, united, states, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, soviet, union, the, soviet, union, had, several, semi, rigid, and, non, rigid, airships, the, semi, rigid, dirigible, sssr, v6, osoaviakhim, was, among, the, largest, of, these, craft, and, it, set, the, longest, endurance, flight, at, the, time, of, over, 130, hours, it, crashed, into, a, mountain, in, 1938, killing, 13, of, the, 19, people, on, board, while, this, was, a, severe, blow, to, the, soviet, airship, program, they, continued, to, operate, non, rigid, airships, until, 1950, while, germany, determined, that, airships, were, obsolete, for, military, purposes, in, the, coming, war, and, concentrated, on, the, development, of, aeroplanes, the, united, states, pursued, a, program, of, military, airship, construction, even, though, it, had, not, developed, a, clear, military, doctrine, for, airship, use, when, the, japanese, attacked, pearl, harbor, on, 7, december, 1941, bringing, the, united, states, into, world, war, ii, the, u, s, navy, had, 10, nonrigid, airships, only, k, and, tc, class, airships, were, suitable, for, combat, and, they, were, quickly, pressed, into, service, against, japanese, and, german, submarines, which, were, then, sinking, american, shipping, within, visual, range, of, the, american, coast, u, s, navy, command, remembering, airship, s, anti, submarine, success, in, world, war, i, immediately, requested, new, modern, antisubmarine, airships, and, on, 2, january, 1942, formed, the, zp, 12, patrol, unit, based, in, lakehurst, from, the, four, k, airships, the, zp, 32, patrol, unit, was, formed, from, two, tc, and, two, l, airships, a, month, later, based, at, nas, moffett, field, in, sunnyvale, california, an, airship, training, base, was, created, there, as, well, the, status, of, submarine, hunting, goodyear, airships, in, the, early, days, of, world, war, ii, has, created, significant, confusion, although, various, accounts, refer, to, airships, resolute, and, volunteer, as, operating, as, privateers, under, a, letter, of, marque, congress, never, authorized, a, commission, nor, did, the, president, sign, one, in, the, years, 1942, 44, approximately, 1, 400, airship, pilots, and, 3, 000, support, crew, members, were, trained, in, the, military, airship, crew, training, program, and, the, airship, military, personnel, grew, from, 430, to, 12, 400, the, u, s, airships, were, produced, by, the, goodyear, factory, in, akron, ohio, from, 1942, till, 1945, 154, airships, were, built, for, the, u, s, navy, 133, k, class, 10, l, class, seven, g, class, four, m, class, and, five, l, class, for, civilian, customers, serial, numbers, l, 4, to, l, 8, the, primary, airship, tasks, were, patrol, and, convoy, escort, near, the, american, coastline, they, also, served, as, an, organization, centre, for, the, convoys, to, direct, ship, movements, and, were, used, in, naval, search, and, rescue, operations, rarer, duties, of, the, airships, included, aerophoto, reconnaissance, naval, mine, laying, and, mine, sweeping, parachute, unit, transport, and, deployment, cargo, and, personnel, transportation, they, were, deemed, quite, successful, in, their, duties, with, the, highest, combat, readiness, factor, in, the, entire, u, s, air, force, 87, during, the, war, some, 532, ships, without, airship, escort, were, sunk, near, the, u, s, coast, by, enemy, submarines, only, one, ship, the, tanker, persephone, of, the, 89, 000, or, so, in, convoys, escorted, by, blimps, was, sunk, by, the, enemy, airships, engaged, submarines, with, depth, charges, and, less, frequently, with, other, on, board, weapons, they, were, excellent, at, driving, submarines, down, where, their, limited, speed, and, range, prevented, them, from, attacking, convoys, the, weapons, available, to, airships, were, so, limited, that, until, the, advent, of, the, homing, torpedo, they, had, little, chance, of, sinking, a, submarine, only, one, airship, was, ever, destroyed, by, u, boat, on, the, night, of, 18, 19, july, 1943, the, k, 74, from, zp, 21, division, was, patrolling, the, coastline, near, florida, using, radar, the, airship, located, a, surfaced, german, submarine, the, k, 74, made, her, attack, run, but, the, u, boat, opened, fire, first, k, 74, s, depth, charges, did, not, release, as, she, crossed, the, u, boat, and, the, k, 74, received, serious, damage, losing, gas, pressure, and, an, engine, but, landing, in, the, water, without, loss, of, life, the, crew, was, rescued, by, patrol, boats, in, the, morning, but, one, crewman, aviation, machinist, s, mate, second, class, isadore, stessel, died, from, a, shark, attack, the, u, boat, submarine, u, 134, was, slightly, damaged, and, the, next, day, or, so, was, attacked, by, aircraft, sustaining, damage, that, forced, it, to, return, to, base, it, was, finally, sunk, on, 24, august, 1943, by, a, british, vickers, wellington, near, vigo,

1945, the, soviets, constructed, a, second, airship, a, pobeda, class, victory, class, unit, used, for, mine, sweeping, and, wreckage, clearing, in, the, black, sea, that, crashed, on, 21, january, 1947, another, w, class, w, 12bis, patriot, was, commissioned, in, 1947, and, was, mostly, used, until, the, mid, 1950s, for, crew, training, parades, and, propaganda, although, airships, are, no, longer, used, for, major, cargo, and, passenger, transport, they, are, still, used, for, other, purposes, such, as, advertising, sightseeing, surveillance, research, and, advocacy, there, were, several, studies, and, proposals, for, nuclear, powered, airships, starting, with, a, 1954, study, by, f, w, locke, jr, for, us, navy, in, 1957, edwin, j, kirschner, published, the, book, the, zeppelin, in, the, atomic, age, which, promoted, the, use, of, atomic, airships, in, 1959, goodyear, presented, a, plan, for, nuclear, powered, airship, for, both, military, and, commercial, use, several, other, proposals, and, papers, were, published, during, the, next, decades, in, the, 1980s, per, lindstrand, and, his, team, introduced, the, ga, 42, airship, the, first, airship, to, use, fly, by, wire, flight, control, which, considerably, reduced, the, pilot, s, workload, an, airship, was, prominently, featured, in, the, james, bond, film, a, view, to, a, kill, released, in, 1985, the, skyship, 500, had, the, livery, of, zorin, industries, the, world, s, largest, thermal, airship, 300, 000, cubic, feet, 8, 500, cubic, metres, was, constructed, by, the, per, lindstrand, company, for, french, botanists, in, 1993, the, as, 300, carried, an, underslung, raft, which, was, positioned, by, the, airship, on, top, of, tree, canopies, in, the, rain, forest, allowing, the, botanists, to, carry, out, their, treetop, research, without, significant, damage, to, the, rainforest, when, research, was, finished, at, a, given, location, the, airship, returned, to, pick, up, and, relocate, the, raft, in, june, 1987, the, u, s, navy, awarded, a, us, 168, 9, million, contract, to, westinghouse, electric, and, airship, industries, of, the, uk, to, find, out, whether, an, airship, could, be, used, as, an, airborne, platform, to, detect, the, threat, of, sea, skimming, missiles, such, as, the, exocet, at, 2, 5, million, cubic, feet, the, westinghouse, airship, industries, sentinel,

intelligence, collection, in, 2008, the, ca, 150, airship, was, launched, by, vantage, airship, this, is, an, improved, modification, of, model, ca, 120, and, completed, manufacturing, in, 2008, with, larger, volume, and, increased, passenger, capacity, it, is, the, largest, manned, nonrigid, airship, in, china, at, present, in, late, june, 2014, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, flew, the, gefa, flug, as, 105, gd, 4, blimp, ae, bates, owned, by, and, in, conjunction, with, greenpeace, over, the, nsa, s, bluffdale, utah, data, center, in, protest, hybrid, designs, such, as, the, heli, stat, airship, helicopter, the, aereon, aerostatic, aerodynamic, craft, and, the, cyclocrane, a, hybrid, aerostatic, rotorcraft, struggled, to, take, flight, the, cyclocrane, was, also, interesting, in, that, the, airship, s, envelope, rotated, along, its, longitudinal, axis, in, 2005, a, short, lived, project, of, the, u, s, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, darpa, was, walrus, hula, which, explored, the, potential, for, using, airships, as, long, distance, heavy, lift, craft, the, primary, goal, of, the, research, program, was, to, determine, the, feasibility, of, building, an, airship, capable, of, carrying, 500, short, tons, 450, t, of, payload, a, distance, of, 12, 000, mi, 19, 000, km, and, land, on, an, unimproved, location, without, the, use, of, external, ballast, or, ground, equipment, such, as, masts, in, 2005, two, contractors, lockheed, martin, and, us, aeros, airships, were, each, awarded, approximately, 3, million, to, do, feasibility, studies, of, designs, for, walrus, congress, removed, funding, for, walrus, hula, in, 2006, in, 2010, the, u, s, army, awarded, a, 517, million, 350, 6, million, contract, to, northrop, grumman, and, partner, hybrid, air, vehicles, to, develop, a, long, endurance, multi, intelligence, vehicle, lemv, system, in, the, form, of, three, hav, 304s, the, project, was, cancelled, in, february, 2012, due, to, it, being, behind, schedule, and, over, budget, also, the, forthcoming, u, s, withdrawal, from, afghanistan, where, it, was, intended, to, be, deployed, following, this, the, hybrid, air, vehicles, hav, 304, airlander, 10, was, repurchased, by, hybrid, air, vehicles, then, modified, and, reassembled, in, bedford, uk, and, renamed, the, airlander, 10, as, of, 2018, it, was, being, tested, in, readiness, for, its, uk, flight, test, programme, a, nse, a, french, company, manufactures, and, operates, airships, and, aerostats, for, 2, years, a, nse, has, been, testing, its, airships, for, the, french, army, airships, and, aerostats, are, operated, to, provide, intelligence, surveillance, and, reconnaissance, isr, support, their, airships, include, many, innovative, features, such, as, water, ballast, take, off, and, landing, systems, variable, geometry, envelopes, and, thrust, vectoring, systems, the, u, s, government, has, funded, two, major, projects, in, the, high, altitude, arena, the, composite, hull, high, altitude, powered, platform, chhapp, is, sponsored, by, u, s, army, space, and, missile, defense, command, this, aircraft, is, also, sometimes, called, hisentinel, high, altitude, airship, this, prototype, ship, made, a, five, hour, test, flight, in, september, 2005, the, second, project, the, high, altitude, airship, haa, is, sponsored, by, darpa, in, 2005, darpa, awarded, a, contract, for, nearly, 150, million, to, lockheed, martin, for, prototype, development, first, flight, of, the, haa, was, planned, for, 2008, but, suffered, programmatic, and, funding, delays, the, haa, project, evolved, into, the, high, altitude, long, endurance, demonstrator, hale, d, the, u, s, army, and, lockheed, martin, launched, the, first, of, its, kind, hale, d, on, july, 27, 2011, after, attaining, an, altitude, of, 32, 000, ft, 9, 800, m, due, to, an, anomaly, the, company, decided, to, abort, the, mission, the, airship, made, a, controlled, descent, in, an, unpopulated, area, of, southwest, pennsylvania, on, 31, january, 2006, lockheed, martin, made, the, first, flight, of, their, secretly, built, hybrid, airship, designated, the, p, 791, the, design, is, very, similar, to, the, skycat, unsuccessfully, promoted, for, many, years, by, the, british, company, advanced, technologies, group, atg, dirigibles, have, been, used, in, the, war, in, afghanistan, for, reconnaissance, purposes, as, they, allow, for, constant, monitoring, of, a, specific, area, through, cameras, mounted, on, the, airships, in, the, 1990s, the, successor, of, the, original, zeppelin, company, in, friedrichshafen, the, zeppelin, luftschifftechnik, gmbh, reengaged, in, airship, construction, the, first, experimental, craft, later, christened, friedrichshafen, of, the, type, zeppelin, nt, flew, in, september, 1997, though, larger, than, common, blimps, the, neue, technologie, new, technology, zeppelins, are, much, smaller, than, their, giant, ancestors, and, not, actually, zeppelin, types, in, the, classical, sense, they, are, sophisticated, semirigids, apart, from, the, greater, payload, their, main, advantages, compared, to, blimps, are, higher, speed, and, excellent, maneuverability, meanwhile, several, zeppelin, nt, have, been, produced, and, operated, profitably, in, joyrides, research, flights, and, similar, applications, in, june, 2004, a, zeppelin, nt, was, sold, for, the, first, time, to, a, japanese, company, nippon, airship, corporation, for, tourism, and, advertising, mainly, around, tokyo, it, was, also, given, a, role, at, the, 2005, expo, in, aichi, the, aircraft, began, a, flight, from, friedrichshafen, to, japan, stopping, at, geneva, paris, rotterdam, munich, berlin, stockholm, and, other, european, cities, to, carry, passengers, on, short, legs, of, the, flight, russian, authorities, denied, overflight, permission, so, the, airship, had, to, be, dismantled, and, shipped, to, japan, rather, than, following, the, historic, graf, zeppelin, flight, from, germany, to, japan, in, 2008, airship, ventures, inc, began, operations, from, moffett, federal, airfield, near, mountain, view, california, and, until, november, 2012, offered, tours, of, the, san, francisco, bay, area, for, up, to, 12, passengers, in, november, 2005, de, beers, a, diamond, mining, company, launched, an, airship, exploration, program, over, the, remote, kalahari, desert, a, zeppelin, nt, equipped, with, a, bell, geospace, gravity, gradiometer, was, used, to, find, potential, diamond, mines, by, scanning, the, local, geography, for, low, density, rock, formations, known, as, kimberlite, pipes, on, 21, september, 2007, the, airship, was, severely, damaged, by, a, whirlwind, while, in, botswana, one, crew, member, who, was, on, watch, aboard, the, moored, craft, was, slightly, injured, but, released, after, overnight, observation, in, hospital, several, companies, such, as, cameron, balloons, in, bristol, united, kingdom, build, hot, air, airships, these, combine, the, structures, of, both, hot, air, balloons, and, small, airships, the, envelope, is, the, normal, cigar, shape, complete, with, tail, fins, but, is, inflated, with, hot, air, instead, of, helium, to, provide, the, lifting, force, a, small, gondola, carrying, the, pilot, and, passengers, a, small, engine, and, the, burners, to, provide, the, hot, air, are, suspended, below, the, envelope, beneath, an, opening, through, which, the, burners, protrude, hot, air, airships, typically, cost, less, to, buy, and, maintain, than, modern, helium, based, blimps, and, can, be, quickly, deflated, after, flights, this, makes, them, easy, to, carry, in, trailers, or, trucks, and, inexpensive, to, store, they, are, usually, very, slow, moving, with, a, typical, top, speed, of, 25, 30, km, h, 16, 19, mph, 6, 9, 8, 3, m, s, they, are, mainly, used, for, advertising, but, at, least, one, has, been, used, in, rainforests, for, wildlife, observation, as, they, can, be, easily, transported, to, remote, areas, remote, controlled, rc, airships, a, type, of, unmanned, aerial, system, uas, are, sometimes, used, for, commercial, purposes, such, as, advertising, and, aerial, video, and, photography, as, well, as, recreational, purposes, they, are, particularly, common, as, an, advertising, mechanism, at, indoor, stadiums, while, rc, airships, are, sometimes, flown, outdoors, doing, so, for, commercial, purposes, is, illegal, in, the, us, commercial, use, of, an, unmanned, airship, must, be, certified, under, part, 121, in, 2008, french, adventurer, stephane, rousson, attempted, to, cross, the, english, channel, with, a, muscular, pedal, powered, airship, stephane, rousson, also, flies, the, a, rosail, a, sky, sailing, yacht, today, with, large, fast, and, more, cost, efficient, fixed, wing, aircraft, and, helicopters, it, is, unknown, whether, huge, airships, can, operate, profitably, in, regular, passenger, transport, though, as, energy, costs, rise, attention, is, once, again, returning, to, these, lighter, than, air, vessels, as, a, possible, alternative, at, the, very, least, the, idea, of, comparatively, slow, majestic, cruising, at, relatively, low, altitudes, and, in, comfortable, atmosphere, certainly, has, retained, some, appeal, there, have, been, some, niches, for, airships, in, and, after, world, war, ii, such, as, long, duration, observations, antisubmarine, patrol, platforms, for, tv, camera, crews, and, advertising, these, generally, require, only, small, and, flexible, craft, and, have, thus, generally, been, better, fitted, for, cheaper, non, passenger, blimps, it, has, periodically, been, suggested, that, airships, could, be, employed, for, cargo, transport, especially, delivering, extremely, heavy, loads, to, areas, with, poor, infrastructure, over, great, distances, this, has, also, been, called, roadless, trucking, also, airships, could, be, used, for, heavy, lifting, over, short, distances, e, g, on, construction, sites, this, is, described, as, heavy, lift, short, haul, in, both, cases, the, airships, are, heavy, haulers, one, recent, enterprise, of, this, sort, was, the, cargolifter, project, in, which, a, hybrid, thus, not, entirely, zeppelin, type, airship, even, larger, than, hindenburg, was, projected, around, 2000, cargolifter, ag, built, the, world, s, largest, self, supporting, hall, measuring, 360, m, 1, 180, ft, long, 210, m, 690, ft, wide, and, 107, m, 351, ft, high, about, 60, km, 37, mi, south, of, berlin, in, may, 2002, the, project, was, stopped, for, financial, reasons, the, company, had, to, file, bankruptcy, the, enormous, cargolifter, hangar, was, later, converted, to, house, the, tropical, islands, resort, although, no, rigid, airships, are, currently, used, for, heavy, lifting, hybrid, airships, are, being, developed, for, such, purposes, aereon, 26, tested, in, 1971, was, described, in, john, mcphee, s, the, deltoid, pumpkin, seed, an, impediment, to, the, large, scale, development, of, airships, as, heavy, haulers, has, been, figuring, out, how, they, can, be, used, in, a, cost, efficient, way, in, order, to, have, a, significant, economic, advantage, over, ocean, transport, cargo, airships, must, be, able, to, deliver, their, payload, faster, than, ocean, carriers, but, more, cheaply, than, airplanes, william, crowder, a, fellow, at, the, logistics, management, institute, has, calculated, that, cargo, airships, are, only, economical, when, they, can, transport, 500, to, 1, 000, tons, approximately, the, same, as, a, super, jumbo, aircraft, the, large, initial, investment, required, to, build, such, a, large, airship, has, been, a, hindrance, to, production, especially, given, the, risk, inherent, in, a, new, technology, the, chief, commercial, officer, of, the, company, hoping, to, sell, the, lmh, 1, a, cargo, airship, currently, being, developed, by, lockheed, martin, believes, that, airships, can, be, economical, in, hard, to, reach, locations, such, as, mining, operations, in, northern, canada, that, currently, require, ice, roads, a, metal, clad, airship, has, a, very, thin, metal, envelope, rather, than, the, usual, fabric, the, shell, may, be, either, internally, braced, or, monocoque, as, in, the, zmc, 2, which, flew, many, times, in, the, 1920s, the, only, example, ever, to, do, so, the, shell, may, be, gas, tight, as, in, a, non, rigid, blimp, or, the, design, may, employ, internal, gas, bags, as, in, a, rigid, airship, compared, to, a, fabric, envelope, the, metal, cladding, is, expected, to, be, more, durable, a, hybrid, airship, is, a, general, term, for, an, aircraft, that, combines, characteristics, of, heavier, than, air, aeroplane, or, helicopter, and, lighter, than, air, technology, examples, include, helicopter, airship, hybrids, intended, for, heavy, lift, applications, and, dynamic, lift, airships, intended, for, long, range, cruising, most, airships, when, fully, loaded, with, cargo, and, fuel, are, usually, ballasted, to, be, heavier, than, air, and, thus, must, use, their, propulsion, system, and, shape, to, create, aerodynamic, lift, necessary, to, stay, aloft, all, airships, can, be, operated, to, be, slightly, heavier, than, air, at, periods, during, flight, descent, accordingly, the, term, hybrid, airship, refers, to, craft, that, obtain, a, significant, portion, of, their, lift, from, aerodynamic, lift, or, other, kinetic, means, for, example, the, aeroscraft, is, a, buoyancy, assisted, air, vehicle, that, generates, lift, through, a, combination, of, aerodynamics, thrust, vectoring, and, gas, buoyancy, generation, and, management, and, for, much, of, the, time, will, fly, heavier, than, air, aeroscraft, is, worldwide, aeros, corporation, s, continuation, of, darpa, s, now, cancelled, walrus, hula, hybrid, ultra, large, aircraft, project, the, patroller, p3, hybrid, airship, developed, by, advanced, hybrid, aircraft, ltd, bc, canada, is, a, relatively, small, 85, 000, cu, ft, 2, 400, m, 3, buoyant, craft, manned, by, the, crew, of, five, and, with, the, endurance, of, up, to, 72, hours, the, flight, tests, with, the, 40, rc, scale, model, proved, that, such, a, craft, can, be, launched, and, landed, without, a, large, team, of, strong, ground, handlers, design, features, a, special, winglet, for, aerodynamic, lift, control, airships, have, been, proposed, as, a, potential, cheap, alternative, to, surface, rocket, launches, for, achieving, earth, orbit, jp, aerospace, have, proposed, the, airship, to, orbit, project, which, intends, to, float, a, multi, stage, airship, up, to, mesospheric, altitudes, of, 55, km, 180, 000, ft, and, then, use, ion, propulsion, to, accelerate, to, orbital, speed, at, these, heights, air, resistance, would, not, be, a, significant, problem, for, achieving, such, speeds, the, company, has, not, yet, built, any, of, the, three, stages, nasa, has, proposed, the, high, altitude, venus, operational, concept, which, comprises, a, series, of, five, missions, including, crewed, missions, to, the, atmosphere, of, venus, in, airships, pressures, on, the, surface, of, the, planet, are, too, high, for, human, habitation, but, at, a, specific, altitude, the, pressure, is, equal, to, that, found, on, earth, and, this, makes, venus, a, potential, target, for, human, colonization, hypothetically, there, could, be, an, airship, lifted, by, a, vacuum, that, is, by, material, that, can, contain, nothing, at, all, inside, but, withstand, the, atmospheric, pressure, from, the, outside, it, is, at, this, point, science, fiction, although, nasa, has, posited, that, some, kind, of, vacuum, airship, could, eventually, be, used, to, explore, the, surface, of, mars, eu, fp7, maat, project, has, studied, an, innovative, cruiser, feeder, airship, system, for, the, stratosphere, with, a, cruiser, remaining, airborne, for, a, long, time, and, feeders, connecting, it, to, the, ground, and, flying, as, piloted, balloons, google, co, founder, sergey, brin, founded, lta, research, in, 2015, to, develop, airships, for, humanitarian, and, cargo, transport, the, company, s, 124, meter, long, airship, pathfinder, 1, received, from, the, faa, a, special, airworthiness, certificate, for, the, helium, filled, airship, in, september, 2023, the, certificate, allowed, the, largest, airship, since, the, ill, fated, hindenburg, to, begin, flight, tests, at, moffett, field, a, joint, civil, military, airport, in, silicon, valley, the, advantage, of, airships, over, aeroplanes, is, that, static, lift, sufficient, for, flight, is, generated, by, the, lifting, gas, and, requires, no, engine, power, this, was, an, immense, advantage, before, the, middle, of, world, war, i, and, remained, an, advantage, for, long, distance, or, long, duration, operations, until, world, war, ii, modern, concepts, for, high, altitude, airships, include, photovoltaic, cells, to, reduce, the, need, to, land, to, refuel, thus, they, can, remain, in, the, air, until, consumables, expire, this, similarly, reduces, or, eliminates, the, need, to, consider, variable, fuel, weight, in, buoyancy, calculations, the, disadvantages, are, that, an, airship, has, a, very, large, reference, area, and, comparatively, large, drag, coefficient, thus, a, larger, drag, force, compared, to, that, of, aeroplanes, and, even, helicopters, given, the, large, frontal, area, and, wetted, surface, of, an, airship, a, practical, limit, is, reached, around, 130, 160, kilometres, per, hour, 80, 100, mph, thus, airships, are, used, where, speed, is, not, critical, the, lift, capability, of, an, airship, is, equal, to, the, buoyant, force, minus, the, weight, of, the, airship, this, assumes, standard, air, temperature, and, pressure, conditions, corrections, are, usually, made, for, water, vapor, and, impurity, of, lifting, gas, as, well, as, percentage, of, inflation, of, the, gas, cells, at, liftoff, based, on, specific, lift, lifting, force, per, unit, volume, of, gas, the, greatest, static, lift, is, provided, by, hydrogen, 11, 15, n, m, 3, or, 71, lb, f, 1000, cu, ft, with, helium, 10, 37, n, m, 3, or, 66, lb, f, 1000, cu, ft, a, close, second, in, addition, to, static, lift, an, airship, can, obtain, a, certain, amount, of, dynamic, lift, from, its, engines, dynamic, lift, in, past, airships, has, been, about, 10, of, the, static, lift, dynamic, lift, allows, an, airship, to, take, off, heavy, from, a, runway, similar, to, fixed, wing, and, rotary, wing, aircraft, this, requires, additional, weight, in, engines, fuel, and, landing, gear, negating, some, of, the, static, lift, capacity, the, altitude, at, which, an, airship, can, fly, largely, depends, on, how, much, lifting, gas, it, can, lose, due, to, expansion, before, stasis, is, reached, the, ultimate, altitude, record, for, a, rigid, airship, was, set, in, 1917, by, the, l, 55, under, the, command, of, hans, kurt, flemming, when, he, forced, the, airship, to, 7, 300, m, 24, 000, ft, attempting, to, cross, france, after, the, silent, raid, on, london, the, l, 55, lost, lift, during, the, descent, to, lower, altitudes, over, germany, and, crashed, due, to, loss, of, lift, while, such, waste, of, gas, was, necessary, for, the, survival, of, airships, in, the, later, years, of, world, war, i, it, was, impractical, for, commercial, operations, or, operations, of, helium, filled, military, airships, the, highest, flight, made, by, a, hydrogen, filled, passenger, airship, was, 1, 700, m, 5, 500, ft, on, the, graf, zeppelin, s, around, the, world, flight, the, greatest, disadvantage, of, the, airship, is, size, which, is, essential, to, increasing, performance, as, size, increases, the, problems, of, ground, handling, increase, geometrically, as, the, german, navy, changed, from, the, p, class, of, 1915, with, a, volume, of, over, 31, 000, m, 3, 1, 100, 000, cu, ft, to, the, larger, q, class, of, 1916, the, r, class, of, 1917, and, finally, the, w, class, of, 1918, at, almost, 62, 000, m, 3, 2, 200, 000, cu, ft, ground, handling, problems, reduced, the, number, of, days, the, zeppelins, were, able, to, make, patrol, flights, this, availability, declined, from, 34, in, 1915, to, 24, 3, in, 1916, and, finally, 17, 5, in, 1918, so, long, as, the, power, to, weight, ratios, of, aircraft, engines, remained, low, and, specific, fuel, consumption, high, the, airship, had, an, edge, for, long, range, or, duration, operations, as, those, figures, changed, the, balance, shifted, rapidly, in, the, aeroplane, s, favour, by, mid, 1917, the, airship, could, no, longer, survive, in, a, combat, situation, where, the, threat, was, aeroplanes, by, the, late, 1930s, the, airship, barely, had, an, advantage, over, the, aeroplane, on, intercontinental, over, water, flights, and, that, advantage, had, vanished, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, this, is, in, face, to, face, tactical, situations, currently, a, high, altitude, airship, project, is, planned, to, survey, hundreds, of, kilometres, as, their, operation, radius, often, much, farther, than, the, normal, engagement, range, of, a, military, aeroplane, for, example, a, radar, mounted, on, a, vessel, platform, 30, m, 100, ft, high, has, radio, horizon, at, 20, km, 12, mi, range, while, a, radar, at, 18, 000, m, 59, 000, ft, altitude, has, radio, horizon, at, 480, km, 300, mi, range, this, is, significantly, important, for, detecting, low, flying, cruise, missiles, or, fighter, bombers, the, most, commonly, used, lifting, gas, helium, is, inert, and, therefore, presents, no, fire, risk, a, series, of, vulnerability, tests, were, done, by, the, uk, defence, evaluation, and, research, agency, dera, on, a, skyship, 600, since, the, internal, gas, pressure, was, maintained, at, only, 1, 2, above, the, surrounding, air, pressure, the, vehicle, proved, highly, tolerant, to, physical, damage, or, to, attack, by, small, arms, fire, or, missiles, several, hundred, high, velocity, bullets, were, fired, through, the, hull, and, even, two, hours, later, the, vehicle, would, have, been, able, to, return, to, base, ordnance, passed, through, the, envelope, without, causing, critical, helium, loss, the, results, and, related, mathematical, model, have, presented, in, the, hypothesis, of, considering, a, zeppelin, nt, size, airship, in, all, instances, of, light, armament, fire, evaluated, under, both, test, and, live, conditions, the, airship, was, able, to, complete, its, mission, and, return, to, base, in, the, united, kingdom, the, basic, pilot, licence, for, airships, is, the, ppl, as, or, private, pilot, licence, which, requires, a, minimum, of, 35, hours, instruction, on, airships, to, fly, commercially, an, commercial, pilot, licence, airships, is, required
