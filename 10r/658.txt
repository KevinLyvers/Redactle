public, transport, also, known, as, public, transportation, public, transit, mass, transit, or, simply, transit, is, a, system, of, transport, for, passengers, by, group, travel, systems, available, for, use, by, the, general, public, unlike, private, transport, typically, managed, on, a, schedule, operated, on, established, routes, and, that, may, charge, a, posted, fee, for, each, trip, there, is, no, rigid, definition, of, which, kinds, of, transport, are, included, and, air, travel, is, often, not, thought, of, when, discussing, public, transport, dictionaries, use, wording, like, buses, trains, etc, examples, of, public, transport, include, city, buses, trolleybuses, trams, or, light, rail, and, passenger, trains, rapid, transit, metro, subway, underground, etc, and, ferries, public, transport, between, cities, is, dominated, by, airlines, coaches, and, intercity, rail, high, speed, rail, networks, are, being, developed, in, many, parts, of, the, world, most, public, transport, systems, run, along, fixed, routes, with, set, embarkation, disembarkation, points, to, a, prearranged, timetable, with, the, most, frequent, services, running, to, a, headway, e, g, every, 15, minutes, as, opposed, to, being, scheduled, for, any, specific, time, of, the, day, however, most, public, transport, trips, include, other, modes, of, travel, such, as, passengers, walking, or, catching, bus, services, to, access, train, stations, share, taxis, offer, on, demand, services, in, many, parts, of, the, world, which, may, compete, with, fixed, public, transport, lines, or, complement, them, by, bringing, passengers, to, interchanges, paratransit, is, sometimes, used, in, areas, of, low, demand, and, for, people, who, need, a, door, to, door, service, urban, public, transit, differs, distinctly, among, asia, north, america, and, europe, in, asia, profit, driven, privately, owned, and, publicly, traded, mass, transit, and, real, estate, conglomerates, predominantly, operate, public, transit, systems, in, north, america, municipal, transit, authorities, most, commonly, run, mass, transit, operations, in, europe, both, state, owned, and, private, companies, predominantly, operate, mass, transit, systems, for, geographical, historical, and, economic, reasons, differences, exist, internationally, regarding, the, use, and, extent, of, public, transport, the, international, association, of, public, transport, uitp, is, the, international, network, for, public, transport, authorities, and, operators, policy, decision, makers, scientific, institutes, and, the, public, transport, supply, and, service, industry, it, has, over, 1, 900, members, from, more, than, 100, countries, from, all, over, the, globe, in, recent, years, some, high, wealth, cities, have, seen, a, decline, in, public, transport, usage, a, number, of, sources, attribute, this, trend, to, the, rise, in, popularity, of, remote, work, ride, sharing, services, and, car, loans, being, relatively, cheap, across, many, countries, major, cities, such, as, toronto, paris, chicago, and, london, have, seen, this, decline, and, have, attempted, to, intervene, by, cutting, fares, and, encouraging, new, modes, of, transportation, such, as, e, scooters, and, e, bikes, because, of, the, reduced, emissions, and, other, environmental, impacts, of, using, public, transportation, over, private, transportation, many, experts, have, pointed, to, an, increased, investment, in, public, transit, as, an, important, climate, change, mitigation, tactic, conveyances, designed, for, public, hire, are, as, old, as, the, first, ferry, service, the, earliest, public, transport, was, water, transport, ferries, appear, in, greek, mythology, writings, the, mystical, ferryman, charon, had, to, be, paid, and, would, only, then, take, passengers, to, hades, some, historical, forms, of, public, transport, include, the, stagecoaches, traveling, a, fixed, route, between, coaching, inns, and, the, horse, drawn, boat, carrying, paying, passengers, which, was, a, feature, of, european, canals, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, the, canal, itself, as, a, form, of, infrastructure, dates, back, to, antiquity, in, ancient, egypt, canals, were, used, for, freight, transportation, to, bypass, the, aswan, cataract, the, chinese, also, built, canals, for, water, transportation, as, far, back, as, the, warring, states, period, which, began, in, the, 5th, century, bce, whether, or, not, those, canals, were, used, for, for, hire, public, transport, remains, unknown, the, grand, canal, in, china, begun, in, 486, bce, served, primarily, the, grain, trade, the, bus, the, first, organized, public, transit, system, within, a, city, appears, to, have, originated, in, paris, in, 1662, although, the, service, in, question, carrosses, cinq, sols, english, five, sol, coaches, which, have, been, developed, by, mathematician, and, philosopher, blaise, pascal, lasted, only, fifteen, years, until, 1677, buses, are, known, to, have, operated, in, nantes, in, 1826, the, public, bus, transport, system, was, introduced, to, london, in, july, 1829, the, first, passenger, horse, drawn, vehicle, opened, in, 1806, it, ran, along, the, swansea, and, mumbles, railway, in, 1825, george, stephenson, built, the, locomotion, no, 1, for, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, in, northeast, england, the, first, public, steam, railway, in, the, world, the, world, s, first, steam, powered, underground, railway, opened, in, london, in, 1863, the, first, successful, electric, streetcar, was, built, for, 11, miles, of, track, for, the, union, passenger, railway, in, tallahassee, florida, in, 1888, electric, streetcars, could, carry, heavier, passenger, loads, than, predecessors, which, reduced, fares, and, stimulated, greater, transit, use, two, years, after, the, richmond, success, over, thirty, two, thousand, electric, streetcars, were, operating, in, america, electric, streetcars, also, paved, the, way, for, the, first, subway, system, in, america, before, electric, streetcars, steam, powered, subways, were, considered, however, most, people, believed, that, riders, would, avoid, the, smoke, filled, subway, tunnels, from, the, steam, engines, in, 1894, boston, built, the, first, subway, in, the, united, states, an, electric, streetcar, line, in, a, 1, 5, mile, tunnel, under, tremont, street, s, retail, district, other, cities, quickly, followed, constructing, thousands, of, miles, of, subway, in, the, following, decades, in, march, 2020, luxembourg, abolished, fares, for, trains, trams, and, buses, and, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, make, all, public, transport, free, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, specifies, that, public, transportation, is, within, urban, areas, but, does, not, limit, its, discussion, of, the, topic, to, urban, areas, seven, criteria, estimate, the, usability, of, different, types, of, public, transport, and, its, overall, appeal, the, criteria, are, speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness, and, directness, speed, is, calculated, from, total, journey, time, including, transfers, proximity, means, how, far, passengers, must, walk, or, otherwise, travel, before, they, can, begin, the, public, transport, leg, of, their, journey, and, how, close, it, leaves, them, to, their, desired, destination, timeliness, is, how, long, they, must, wait, for, the, vehicle, directness, records, how, far, a, journey, using, public, transport, deviates, from, a, passenger, s, ideal, route, in, selecting, between, competing, modes, of, transport, many, individuals, are, strongly, motivated, by, direct, cost, travel, fare, ticket, price, to, them, and, convenience, as, well, as, being, informed, by, habit, the, same, individual, may, accept, the, lost, time, and, statistically, higher, risk, of, accident, in, private, transport, together, with, the, initial, running, and, parking, costs, loss, of, control, spatial, constriction, overcrowding, high, speeds, accelerations, height, and, other, phobias, may, discourage, use, of, public, transport, actual, travel, time, on, public, transport, becomes, a, lesser, consideration, when, predictable, and, when, travel, itself, is, reasonably, comfortable, seats, toilets, services, and, can, thus, be, scheduled, and, used, pleasurably, productively, or, for, overnight, rest, chauffeured, movement, is, enjoyed, by, many, people, when, it, is, relaxing, safe, but, not, too, monotonous, waiting, interchanging, stops, and, holdups, for, example, due, to, traffic, or, for, security, are, discomforting, jet, lag, is, a, human, constraint, discouraging, frequent, rapid, long, distance, east, west, commuting, favoring, modern, telecommunications, and, vr, technologies, an, airline, provides, scheduled, service, with, aircraft, between, airports, air, travel, has, high, speeds, but, incurs, large, waiting, times, before, and, after, travel, and, is, therefore, often, only, feasible, over, longer, distances, or, in, areas, where, a, lack, of, surface, infrastructure, makes, other, modes, of, transport, impossible, bush, airlines, work, more, similarly, to, bus, stops, an, aircraft, waits, for, passengers, and, takes, off, when, the, aircraft, is, full, bus, services, use, buses, on, conventional, roads, to, carry, numerous, passengers, on, shorter, journeys, buses, operate, with, low, capacity, compared, with, trams, or, trains, and, can, operate, on, conventional, roads, with, relatively, inexpensive, bus, stops, to, serve, passengers, therefore, buses, are, commonly, used, in, smaller, cities, towns, and, rural, areas, and, for, shuttle, services, supplementing, other, means, of, transit, in, large, cities, bus, rapid, transit, is, an, ambiguous, term, used, for, buses, operating, on, dedicated, right, of, way, much, like, a, light, rail, coach, services, use, coaches, long, distance, buses, for, suburb, to, cbd, or, longer, distance, transportation, the, vehicles, are, normally, equipped, with, more, comfortable, seating, a, separate, luggage, compartment, video, and, possibly, also, a, toilet, they, have, higher, standards, than, city, buses, but, a, limited, stopping, pattern, trolleybuses, are, electrically, powered, buses, that, receive, power, from, overhead, power, line, by, way, of, a, set, of, trolley, poles, for, mobility, online, electric, vehicles, are, buses, that, run, on, a, conventional, battery, but, are, recharged, frequently, at, certain, points, via, underground, wires, certain, types, of, buses, styled, after, old, style, streetcars, are, also, called, trackless, trolleys, but, are, built, on, the, same, platforms, as, a, typical, diesel, cng, or, hybrid, bus, these, are, more, often, used, for, tourist, rides, than, commuting, and, tend, to, be, privately, owned, passenger, rail, transport, is, the, conveyance, of, passengers, by, means, of, wheeled, vehicles, specially, designed, to, run, on, railways, trains, allow, high, capacity, at, most, distance, scales, but, require, track, signalling, infrastructure, and, stations, to, be, built, and, maintained, resulting, in, high, upfront, costs, intercity, rail, is, long, haul, passenger, services, that, connect, multiple, urban, areas, they, have, few, stops, and, aim, at, high, average, speeds, typically, only, making, one, of, a, few, stops, per, city, these, services, may, also, be, international, high, speed, rail, is, passenger, trains, operating, significantly, faster, than, conventional, rail, typically, defined, as, at, least, 200, kilometres, per, hour, 120, mph, the, most, predominant, systems, have, been, built, in, europe, and, east, asia, and, compared, with, air, travel, offer, long, distance, rail, journeys, as, quick, as, air, services, have, lower, prices, to, compete, more, effectively, and, use, electricity, instead, of, combustion, urban, rail, transit, is, an, all, encompassing, term, for, various, types, of, local, rail, systems, such, as, these, examples, trams, light, rail, rapid, transit, people, movers, commuter, rail, monorail, suspension, railways, and, funiculars, commuter, rail, is, part, of, an, urban, area, s, public, transport, it, provides, faster, services, to, outer, suburbs, and, neighboring, satellite, cities, trains, stop, at, train, stations, that, are, located, to, serve, a, smaller, suburban, or, town, center, the, stations, are, often, combined, with, shuttle, bus, or, park, and, ride, systems, frequency, may, be, up, to, several, times, per, hour, and, commuter, rail, systems, may, either, be, part, of, the, national, railway, or, operated, by, local, transit, agencies, common, forms, of, commuter, rail, employ, either, diesel, electric, locomotives, or, electric, multiple, unit, trains, some, commuter, train, lines, share, a, railway, with, freight, trains, a, rapid, transit, railway, system, also, called, a, metro, underground, heavy, rail, or, subway, operates, in, an, urban, area, with, high, capacity, and, frequency, and, grade, separation, from, other, traffic, heavy, rail, is, a, high, capacity, form, of, rail, transit, with, 4, to, 10, units, forming, a, train, and, can, be, the, most, expensive, form, of, transit, to, build, modern, heavy, rail, systems, are, mostly, driverless, which, allows, for, higher, frequencies, and, less, maintenance, cost, systems, are, able, to, transport, large, numbers, of, people, quickly, over, short, distances, with, little, land, use, variations, of, rapid, transit, include, people, movers, small, scale, light, metro, and, the, commuter, rail, hybrid, s, bahn, more, than, 160, cities, have, rapid, transit, systems, totalling, more, than, 8, 000, km, 4, 971, mi, of, track, and, 7, 000, stations, twenty, five, cities, have, systems, under, construction, people, movers, are, a, special, term, for, grade, separated, rail, which, uses, vehicles, that, are, smaller, and, shorter, in, size, these, systems, are, generally, used, only, in, a, small, area, such, as, a, theme, park, or, an, airport, trams, also, known, as, streetcars, are, railborne, vehicles, that, run, in, city, streets, or, dedicated, tracks, they, have, higher, capacity, than, buses, but, must, follow, dedicated, infrastructure, with, rails, and, wires, either, above, or, below, the, track, limiting, their, flexibility, in, the, united, states, trams, were, commonly, used, prior, to, the, 1930s, before, being, superseded, by, the, bus, in, modern, public, transport, systems, they, have, been, reintroduced, in, the, form, of, the, light, rail, light, rail, is, a, redevelopment, and, use, of, the, tram, with, dedicated, right, of, way, not, shared, with, other, traffic, often, step, free, access, and, increased, speed, light, rail, lines, are, thus, essentially, modernized, interurbans, unlike, trams, light, rail, systems, are, longer, and, have, one, to, four, cars, per, train, somewhere, between, light, and, heavy, rail, in, terms, of, carbon, footprint, monorail, systems, usually, use, overhead, single, tracks, either, mounted, directly, on, the, track, supports, or, put, in, an, overhead, design, with, the, train, suspended, monorail, systems, are, used, throughout, the, world, especially, in, europe, and, east, asia, particularly, japan, but, apart, from, public, transit, installations, in, las, vegas, and, seattle, most, north, american, monorails, are, either, short, shuttle, services, or, privately, owned, services, with, 150, 000, daily, riders, the, disney, monorail, systems, used, at, their, parks, may, be, the, most, famous, in, the, world, personal, rapid, transit, is, an, automated, cab, service, that, runs, on, rails, or, a, guideway, this, is, an, uncommon, mode, of, transportation, excluding, elevators, due, to, the, complexity, of, automation, a, fully, implemented, system, might, provide, most, of, the, convenience, of, individual, automobiles, with, the, efficiency, of, public, transit, the, crucial, innovation, is, that, the, automated, vehicles, carry, just, a, few, passengers, turn, off, the, guideway, to, pick, up, passengers, permitting, other, prt, vehicles, to, continue, at, full, speed, and, drop, them, off, to, the, location, of, their, choice, rather, than, at, a, stop, conventional, transit, simulations, show, that, prt, might, attract, many, auto, users, in, problematic, medium, density, urban, areas, a, number, of, experimental, systems, are, in, progress, one, might, compare, personal, rapid, transit, to, the, more, labor, intensive, taxi, or, paratransit, modes, of, transportation, or, to, the, by, now, automated, elevators, common, in, many, publicly, accessible, areas, cable, propelled, transit, cpt, is, a, transit, technology, that, moves, people, in, motor, less, engine, less, vehicles, that, are, propelled, by, a, steel, cable, there, are, two, sub, groups, of, cpt, gondola, lifts, and, cable, cars, railway, gondola, lifts, are, supported, and, propelled, from, above, by, cables, whereas, cable, cars, are, supported, and, propelled, from, below, by, cables, while, historically, associated, with, usage, in, ski, resorts, gondola, lifts, are, now, finding, increased, consumption, and, utilization, in, many, urban, areas, built, specifically, for, the, purposes, of, mass, transit, many, if, not, all, of, these, systems, are, implemented, and, fully, integrated, within, existing, public, transportation, networks, examples, include, metrocable, medell, n, metrocable, caracas, mi, telef, rico, in, la, paz, portland, aerial, tram, roosevelt, island, tramway, in, new, york, city, and, the, london, cable, car, a, ferry, is, a, boat, used, to, carry, or, ferry, passengers, and, sometimes, their, vehicles, across, a, body, of, water, a, foot, passenger, ferry, with, many, stops, is, sometimes, called, a, water, bus, ferries, form, a, part, of, the, public, transport, systems, of, many, waterside, cities, and, islands, allowing, direct, transit, between, points, at, a, capital, cost, much, lower, than, bridges, or, tunnels, though, at, a, lower, speed, ship, connections, of, much, larger, distances, such, as, over, long, distances, in, water, bodies, like, the, mediterranean, sea, may, also, be, called, ferry, services, a, report, published, by, the, uk, national, infrastructure, commission, in, 2018, states, that, cycling, is, mass, transit, and, must, be, treated, as, such, cycling, infrastructure, is, normally, provided, without, charge, to, users, because, it, is, cheaper, to, operate, than, mechanised, transit, systems, that, use, sophisticated, equipment, and, do, not, use, human, power, many, cities, around, the, world, have, introduced, electric, bikes, and, scooters, to, their, public, transport, infrastructure, for, example, in, the, netherlands, many, individuals, use, e, bikes, to, replace, their, car, commutes, in, major, american, cities, start, up, companies, such, as, uber, and, lyft, have, implemented, e, scooters, as, a, way, for, people, to, take, short, trips, around, the, city, all, public, transport, runs, on, infrastructure, either, on, roads, rail, airways, or, seaways, the, infrastructure, can, be, shared, with, other, modes, freight, and, private, transport, or, it, can, be, dedicated, to, public, transport, the, latter, is, especially, valuable, in, cases, where, there, are, capacity, problems, for, private, transport, investments, in, infrastructure, are, expensive, and, make, up, a, substantial, part, of, the, total, costs, in, systems, that, are, new, or, expanding, once, built, the, infrastructure, will, require, operating, and, maintenance, costs, adding, to, the, total, cost, of, public, transport, sometimes, governments, subsidize, infrastructure, by, providing, it, free, of, charge, just, as, is, common, with, roads, for, automobiles, interchanges, are, locations, where, passengers, can, switch, from, one, public, transport, route, to, another, this, may, be, between, vehicles, of, the, same, mode, like, a, bus, interchange, or, e, g, between, bus, and, train, it, can, be, between, local, and, intercity, transport, such, as, at, a, central, station, or, airport, timetables, or, schedules, in, north, american, english, are, provided, by, the, transport, operator, to, allow, users, to, plan, their, journeys, they, are, often, supplemented, by, maps, and, fare, schemes, to, help, travelers, coordinate, their, travel, online, public, transport, route, planners, help, make, planning, easier, mobile, apps, are, available, for, multiple, transit, systems, that, provide, timetables, and, other, service, information, and, in, some, cases, allow, ticket, purchase, some, allowing, to, plan, your, journey, with, time, fares, zones, e, g, services, are, often, arranged, to, operate, at, regular, intervals, throughout, the, day, or, part, of, the, day, known, as, clock, face, scheduling, often, more, frequent, services, or, even, extra, routes, are, operated, during, the, morning, and, evening, rush, hours, coordination, between, services, at, interchange, points, is, important, to, reduce, the, total, travel, time, for, passengers, this, can, be, done, by, coordinating, shuttle, services, with, main, routes, or, by, creating, a, fixed, time, for, instance, twice, per, hour, when, all, bus, and, rail, routes, meet, at, a, station, and, exchange, passengers, there, is, often, a, potential, conflict, between, this, objective, and, optimising, the, utilisation, of, vehicles, and, drivers, the, main, sources, of, financing, are, ticket, revenue, government, subsidies, and, advertising, the, percentage, of, revenue, from, passenger, charges, is, known, as, the, farebox, recovery, ratio, a, limited, amount, of, income, may, come, from, land, development, and, rental, income, from, stores, and, vendors, parking, fees, and, leasing, tunnels, and, rights, of, way, to, carry, fiber, optic, communication, lines, most, but, not, all, public, transport, requires, the, purchase, of, a, ticket, to, generate, revenue, for, the, operators, tickets, may, be, bought, either, in, advance, or, at, the, time, of, the, journey, or, the, carrier, may, allow, both, methods, passengers, may, be, issued, with, a, paper, ticket, a, metal, or, plastic, token, or, a, magnetic, or, electronic, card, smart, card, contactless, smart, card, sometimes, a, ticket, has, to, be, validated, e, g, a, paper, ticket, has, to, be, stamped, or, an, electronic, ticket, has, to, be, checked, in, tickets, may, be, valid, for, a, single, or, return, trip, or, valid, within, a, certain, area, for, a, period, of, time, see, transit, pass, the, fare, is, based, on, the, travel, class, either, depending, on, the, traveled, distance, or, based, on, zone, pricing, the, tickets, may, have, to, be, shown, or, checked, automatically, at, the, station, platform, or, when, boarding, or, during, the, ride, by, a, conductor, operators, may, choose, to, control, all, riders, allowing, sale, of, the, ticket, at, the, time, of, ride, alternatively, a, proof, of, payment, system, allows, riders, to, enter, the, vehicles, without, showing, the, ticket, but, riders, may, or, may, not, be, controlled, by, a, ticket, controller, if, the, rider, fails, to, show, proof, of, payment, the, operator, may, fine, the, rider, at, the, magnitude, of, the, fare, multi, use, tickets, allow, travel, more, than, once, in, addition, to, return, tickets, this, includes, period, cards, allowing, travel, within, a, certain, area, for, instance, month, cards, or, to, travel, a, specified, number, of, trips, or, number, of, days, that, can, be, chosen, within, a, longer, period, of, time, called, carnet, ticket, passes, aimed, at, tourists, allowing, free, or, discounted, entry, at, many, tourist, attractions, typically, include, zero, fare, public, transport, within, the, city, period, tickets, may, be, for, a, particular, route, in, both, directions, or, for, a, whole, network, a, free, travel, pass, allowing, free, and, unlimited, travel, within, a, system, is, sometimes, granted, to, particular, social, sectors, for, example, students, elderly, children, employees, job, ticket, and, the, physically, or, mentally, disabled, zero, fare, public, transport, services, are, funded, in, full, by, means, other, than, collecting, a, fare, from, passengers, normally, through, heavy, subsidy, or, commercial, sponsorship, by, businesses, several, mid, size, european, cities, and, many, smaller, towns, around, the, world, have, converted, their, entire, bus, networks, to, zero, fare, the, only, european, capitals, with, free, public, transport, are, tallinn, and, luxembourg, local, zero, fare, shuttles, or, inner, city, loops, are, far, more, common, than, city, wide, systems, there, are, also, zero, fare, airport, circulators, and, university, transportation, systems, governments, frequently, opt, to, subsidize, public, transport, for, social, environmental, or, economic, reasons, common, motivations, include, the, desire, to, provide, transport, to, people, who, are, unable, to, use, an, automobile, and, to, reduce, congestion, land, use, and, automobile, emissions, subsidies, may, take, the, form, of, direct, payments, for, financially, unprofitable, services, but, support, may, also, include, indirect, subsidies, for, example, the, government, may, allow, free, or, reduced, cost, use, of, state, owned, infrastructure, such, as, railways, and, roads, to, stimulate, public, transport, s, economic, competitiveness, over, private, transport, that, normally, also, has, free, infrastructure, subsidized, through, such, things, as, gas, taxes, other, subsidies, include, tax, advantages, for, instance, aviation, fuel, is, typically, not, taxed, bailouts, if, companies, that, are, likely, to, collapse, often, applied, to, airlines, and, reduction, of, competition, through, licensing, schemes, often, applied, to, taxis, and, airlines, private, transport, is, normally, subsidized, indirectly, through, free, roads, and, infrastructure, as, well, as, incentives, to, build, car, factories, and, on, occasion, directly, via, bailouts, of, automakers, subsidies, also, may, take, the, form, of, initial, or, increased, tolls, for, drivers, such, as, the, san, francisco, bay, area, raising, tolls, on, numerous, bridges, and, proposing, more, hikes, to, fund, the, bay, area, rapid, transit, system, land, development, schemes, may, be, initialized, where, operators, are, given, the, rights, to, use, lands, near, stations, depots, or, tracks, for, property, development, for, instance, in, hong, kong, mtr, corporation, limited, and, kcr, corporation, generate, additional, profits, from, land, development, to, partially, cover, the, cost, of, the, construction, of, the, urban, rail, system, some, supporters, of, mass, transit, believe, that, use, of, taxpayer, capital, to, fund, mass, transit, will, ultimately, save, taxpayer, money, in, other, ways, and, therefore, state, funded, mass, transit, is, a, benefit, to, the, taxpayer, some, research, has, supported, this, position, but, the, measurement, of, benefits, and, costs, is, a, complex, and, controversial, issue, a, lack, of, mass, transit, results, in, more, traffic, pollution, and, road, construction, to, accommodate, more, vehicles, all, costly, to, taxpayers, providing, mass, transit, will, therefore, alleviate, these, costs, a, study, found, that, support, for, public, transport, spending, is, much, higher, among, conservatives, who, have, high, levels, of, trust, in, government, officials, than, those, who, do, not, relative, to, other, forms, of, transportation, public, transit, is, safe, with, a, low, crash, risk, and, secure, with, low, rates, of, crime, the, injury, and, death, rate, for, public, transit, is, roughly, one, tenth, that, of, automobile, travel, a, 2014, study, noted, that, residents, of, transit, oriented, communities, have, about, one, fifth, the, per, capita, crash, casualty, rate, as, in, automobile, oriented, communities, and, that, transit, also, tends, to, have, lower, overall, crime, rates, than, automobile, travel, and, transit, improvements, can, help, reduce, overall, crime, risk, by, improving, surveillance, and, economic, opportunities, for, at, risk, populations, although, relatively, safe, and, secure, public, perceptions, that, transit, systems, are, dangerous, endure, a, 2014, study, stated, that, various, factors, contribute, to, the, under, appreciation, of, transit, safety, benefits, including, the, nature, of, transit, travel, dramatic, news, coverage, of, transit, crashes, and, crimes, transit, agency, messages, that, unintentionally, emphasize, risks, without, providing, information, on, its, overall, safety, and, biased, traffic, safety, analysis, some, systems, attract, vagrants, who, use, the, stations, or, trains, as, sleeping, shelters, though, most, operators, have, practices, that, discourage, this, public, transport, is, means, of, independent, transport, for, individuals, without, walking, or, bicycling, such, as, children, too, young, to, drive, the, elderly, without, access, to, cars, those, who, do, not, hold, a, drivers, license, and, the, infirm, such, as, wheelchair, users, kneeling, buses, low, floor, access, boarding, on, buses, and, light, rail, has, also, enabled, greater, access, for, the, disabled, in, mobility, in, recent, decades, low, floor, access, has, been, incorporated, into, modern, designs, for, vehicles, in, economically, deprived, areas, public, transport, increases, individual, accessibility, to, transport, where, private, means, are, unaffordable, although, there, is, continuing, debate, as, to, the, true, efficiency, of, different, modes, of, transportation, mass, transit, is, generally, regarded, as, significantly, more, energy, efficient, than, other, forms, of, travel, a, 2002, study, by, the, brookings, institution, and, the, american, enterprise, institute, found, that, public, transportation, in, the, u, s, uses, approximately, half, the, fuel, required, by, cars, suvs, and, light, trucks, in, addition, the, study, noted, that, private, vehicles, emit, about, 95, percent, more, carbon, monoxide, 92, percent, more, volatile, organic, compounds, and, about, twice, as, much, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, than, public, vehicles, for, every, passenger, mile, traveled, studies, have, shown, that, there, is, a, strong, inverse, correlation, between, urban, population, density, and, energy, consumption, per, capita, and, that, public, transport, could, facilitate, increased, urban, population, densities, and, thus, reduce, travel, distances, and, fossil, fuel, consumption, supporters, of, the, green, movement, usually, advocate, public, transportation, because, it, offers, decreased, airborne, pollution, compared, to, automobiles, a, study, conducted, in, milan, italy, in, 2004, during, and, after, a, transportation, strike, serves, to, illustrate, the, impact, that, mass, transportation, has, on, the, environment, air, samples, were, taken, between, 2, and, 9, january, and, then, tested, for, methane, carbon, monoxide, non, methane, hydrocarbons, nmhcs, and, other, gases, identified, as, harmful, to, the, environment, the, figure, below, is, a, computer, simulation, showing, the, results, of, the, study, with, 2, january, showing, the, lowest, concentrations, as, a, result, of, decreased, activity, in, the, city, during, the, holiday, season, 9, january, showed, the, highest, nmhc, concentrations, because, of, increased, vehicular, activity, in, the, city, due, to, a, public, transportation, strike, based, on, the, benefits, of, public, transport, the, green, movement, has, affected, public, policy, for, example, the, state, of, new, jersey, released, getting, to, work, reconnecting, jobs, with, transit, this, initiative, attempts, to, relocate, new, jobs, into, areas, with, higher, public, transportation, accessibility, the, initiative, cites, the, use, of, public, transportation, as, being, a, means, of, reducing, traffic, congestion, providing, an, economic, boost, to, the, areas, of, job, relocation, and, most, importantly, contributing, to, a, green, environment, by, reducing, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, emissions, using, public, transportation, can, result, in, a, reduction, of, an, individual, s, carbon, footprint, a, single, person, 20, mile, 32, km, round, trip, by, car, can, be, replaced, using, public, transportation, and, result, in, a, net, co, 2, emissions, reduction, of, 4, 800, pounds, 2, 200, kg, per, year, using, public, transportation, saves, co, 2, emissions, in, more, ways, than, simply, travel, as, public, transportation, can, help, to, alleviate, traffic, congestion, as, well, as, promote, more, efficient, land, use, when, all, three, of, these, are, considered, it, is, estimated, that, 37, million, metric, tons, of, co, 2, will, be, saved, annually, another, study, claims, that, using, public, transit, instead, of, private, in, the, u, s, in, 2005, would, have, reduced, co, 2, emissions, by, 3, 9, million, metric, tons, and, that, the, resulting, traffic, congestion, reduction, accounts, for, an, additional, 3, 0, million, metric, tons, of, co, 2, saved, this, is, a, total, savings, of, about, 6, 9, million, metric, tons, per, year, given, the, 2005, values, in, order, to, compare, energy, impact, of, public, transportation, to, private, transportation, the, amount, of, energy, per, passenger, mile, must, be, calculated, the, reason, that, comparing, the, energy, expenditure, per, person, is, necessary, is, to, normalize, the, data, for, easy, comparison, here, the, units, are, in, per, 100, p, km, read, as, person, kilometer, or, passenger, kilometer, in, terms, of, energy, consumption, public, transportation, is, better, than, individual, transport, in, a, personal, vehicle, in, england, bus, and, rail, are, popular, methods, of, public, transportation, especially, in, london, rail, provides, rapid, movement, into, and, out, of, the, city, of, london, while, busing, helps, to, provide, transport, within, the, city, itself, as, of, 2006, 2007, the, total, energy, cost, of, london, s, trains, was, 15, kwh, per, 100, p, km, about, 5, times, better, than, a, personal, car, for, busing, in, london, it, was, 32, kwh, per, 100, p, km, or, about, 2, 5, times, that, of, a, personal, car, this, includes, lighting, depots, inefficiencies, due, to, capacity, i, e, the, train, or, bus, may, not, be, operating, at, full, capacity, at, all, times, and, other, inefficiencies, efficiencies, of, transport, in, japan, in, 1999, were, 68, kwh, per, 100, p, km, for, a, personal, car, 19, kwh, per, 100, p, km, for, a, bus, 6, kwh, per, 100, p, km, for, rail, 51, kwh, per, 100, p, km, for, air, and, 57, kwh, per, 100, p, km, for, sea, these, numbers, from, either, country, can, be, used, in, energy, comparison, calculations, or, life, cycle, assessment, calculations, public, transportation, also, provides, an, arena, to, test, environmentally, friendly, fuel, alternatives, such, as, hydrogen, powered, vehicles, swapping, out, materials, to, create, lighter, public, transportation, vehicles, with, the, same, or, better, performance, will, increase, environmental, friendliness, of, public, transportation, vehicles, while, maintaining, current, standards, or, improving, them, informing, the, public, about, the, positive, environmental, effects, of, using, public, transportation, in, addition, to, pointing, out, the, potential, economic, benefit, is, an, important, first, step, towards, making, a, difference, in, the, 2023, study, titled, subways, and, co, emissions, a, global, analysis, with, satellite, data, research, reveals, that, subway, systems, significantly, reduce, co, emissions, by, approximately, 50, in, the, cities, they, serve, contributing, to, an, 11, global, reduction, the, study, also, explores, potential, expansion, in, 1, 214, urban, areas, lacking, subways, suggesting, a, potential, emission, cut, by, up, to, 77, economically, subways, are, viable, in, 794, cities, under, optimistic, financial, conditions, scc, at, us, 150, ton, and, sic, at, us, 140, million, km, but, this, figure, drops, to, 294, cities, with, more, pessimistic, assumptions, despite, high, costs, about, us, 200, million, per, kilometer, for, construction, subways, offer, substantial, co, benefits, such, as, reduced, traffic, congestion, and, improved, public, health, making, them, a, strategic, investment, for, urban, sustainability, and, climate, mitigation, dense, areas, with, mixed, land, uses, promote, daily, public, transport, use, while, urban, sprawl, is, associated, with, sporadic, public, transport, use, a, recent, european, multi, city, survey, found, that, dense, urban, environments, reliable, and, affordable, public, transport, services, and, limiting, motorized, vehicles, in, high, density, areas, of, the, cities, will, help, achieve, much, needed, promotion, of, public, transport, use, urban, space, is, a, precious, commodity, and, public, transport, utilises, it, more, efficiently, than, a, car, dominant, society, allowing, cities, to, be, built, more, compactly, than, if, they, were, dependent, on, automobile, transport, if, public, transport, planning, is, at, the, core, of, urban, planning, it, will, also, force, cities, to, be, built, more, compactly, to, create, efficient, feeds, into, the, stations, and, stops, of, transport, this, will, at, the, same, time, allow, the, creation, of, centers, around, the, hubs, serving, passengers, daily, commercial, needs, and, public, services, this, approach, significantly, reduces, urban, sprawl, public, land, planning, for, public, transportation, can, be, difficult, but, it, is, the, state, and, regional, organizations, that, are, responsible, to, planning, and, improving, public, transportation, roads, and, routes, with, public, land, prices, booming, there, must, be, a, plan, to, using, the, land, most, efficiently, for, public, transportation, in, order, to, create, better, transportation, systems, inefficient, land, use, and, poor, planning, leads, to, a, decrease, in, accessibility, to, jobs, education, and, health, care, the, consequences, for, wider, society, and, civic, life, is, public, transport, breaks, down, social, and, cultural, barriers, between, people, in, public, life, an, important, social, role, played, by, public, transport, is, to, ensure, that, all, members, of, society, are, able, to, travel, without, walking, or, cycling, not, just, those, with, a, driving, license, and, access, to, an, automobile, which, include, groups, such, as, the, young, the, old, the, poor, those, with, medical, conditions, and, people, banned, from, driving, automobile, dependency, is, a, name, given, by, policy, makers, to, places, where, those, without, access, to, a, private, vehicle, do, not, have, access, to, independent, mobility, this, dependency, contributes, to, the, transport, divide, a, 2018, study, published, in, the, journal, of, environmental, economics, and, management, concluded, that, expanded, access, to, public, transit, has, no, meaningful, impact, on, automobile, volume, in, the, long, term, above, that, public, transportation, opens, to, its, users, the, possibility, of, meeting, other, people, as, no, concentration, is, diverted, from, interacting, with, fellow, travelers, due, to, any, steering, activities, adding, to, the, above, said, public, transport, becomes, a, location, of, inter, social, encounters, across, all, boundaries, of, social, ethnic, and, other, types, of, affiliation, the, covid, 19, pandemic, had, a, substantial, effect, on, public, transport, systems, infrastructures, and, revenues, in, various, cities, across, the, world, the, pandemic, negatively, impacted, public, transport, usage, by, imposing, social, distancing, remote, work, or, unemployment, in, the, united, states, it, caused, a, 79, drop, in, public, transport, riders, at, the, beginning, of, 2020, this, trend, continued, throughout, the, year, with, a, 65, reduced, ridership, as, compared, to, previous, years, similarly, in, london, at, the, beginning, of, 2020, ridership, in, the, london, underground, and, buses, declined, by, 95, and, 85, respectively, a, 55, drop, in, public, transport, ridership, as, compared, to, 2019, was, reported, in, cairo, egypt, after, a, period, of, mandatory, halt, to, reduce, covid, spread, through, cash, contact, in, nairobi, kenya, cashless, payment, systems, were, enforced, by, national, transport, and, safety, authority, ntsa, public, transport, was, halted, for, three, months, in, 2020, in, kampala, uganda, with, people, resorting, to, walking, or, cycling, post, quarantine, upon, renovating, public, transport, infrastructure, public, transport, such, as, minibus, taxis, were, assigned, specific, routes, the, situation, was, difficult, in, cities, where, people, are, heavily, dependent, on, the, public, transport, system, in, kigali, rwanda, social, distancing, requirements, led, to, fifty, percent, occupancy, restrictions, but, as, the, pandemic, situation, improved, the, occupancy, limit, was, increased, to, meet, popular, demands, addis, ababa, ethiopia, also, had, inadequate, bus, services, relative, to, demand, and, longer, wait, times, due, to, social, distancing, restrictions, and, planned, to, deploy, more, buses, both, addis, ababa, and, kampala, aim, to, improve, walking, and, cycling, infrastructures, in, the, future, as, means, of, commuting, complementary, to, buses
