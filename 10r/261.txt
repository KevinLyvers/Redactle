laser, cutting, is, a, technology, that, uses, a, laser, to, vaporize, materials, resulting, in, a, cut, edge, while, typically, used, for, industrial, manufacturing, applications, it, is, now, used, by, schools, small, businesses, architecture, and, hobbyists, laser, cutting, works, by, directing, the, output, of, a, high, power, laser, most, commonly, through, optics, the, laser, optics, and, cnc, computer, numerical, control, are, used, to, direct, the, laser, beam, to, the, material, a, commercial, laser, for, cutting, materials, uses, a, motion, control, system, to, follow, a, cnc, or, g, code, of, the, pattern, to, be, cut, onto, the, material, the, focused, laser, beam, is, directed, at, the, material, which, then, either, melts, burns, vaporizes, away, or, is, blown, away, by, a, jet, of, gas, leaving, an, edge, with, a, high, quality, surface, finish, in, 1965, the, first, production, laser, cutting, machine, was, used, to, drill, holes, in, diamond, dies, this, machine, was, made, by, the, western, electric, engineering, research, center, in, 1967, the, british, pioneered, laser, assisted, oxygen, jet, cutting, for, metals, in, the, early, 1970s, this, technology, was, put, into, production, to, cut, titanium, for, aerospace, applications, at, the, same, time, co, 2, lasers, were, adapted, to, cut, non, metals, such, as, textiles, because, at, the, time, co, 2, lasers, were, not, powerful, enough, to, overcome, the, thermal, conductivity, of, metals, the, laser, beam, is, generally, focused, using, a, high, quality, lens, on, the, work, zone, the, quality, of, the, beam, has, a, direct, impact, on, the, focused, spot, size, the, narrowest, part, of, the, focused, beam, is, generally, less, than, 0, 0125, inches, 0, 32, mm, in, diameter, depending, upon, the, material, thickness, kerf, widths, as, small, as, 0, 004, inches, 0, 10, mm, are, possible, in, order, to, be, able, to, start, cutting, from, somewhere, other, than, the, edge, a, pierce, is, done, before, every, cut, piercing, usually, involves, a, high, power, pulsed, laser, beam, which, slowly, makes, a, hole, in, the, material, taking, around, 5, 15, seconds, for, 0, 5, inch, thick, 13, mm, stainless, steel, for, example, the, parallel, rays, of, coherent, light, from, the, laser, source, often, fall, in, the, range, between, 0, 06, 0, 08, inches, 1, 5, 2, 0, mm, in, diameter, this, beam, is, normally, focused, and, intensified, by, a, lens, or, a, mirror, to, a, very, small, spot, of, about, 0, 001, inches, 0, 025, mm, to, create, a, very, intense, laser, beam, in, order, to, achieve, the, smoothest, possible, finish, during, contour, cutting, the, direction, of, the, beam, polarization, must, be, rotated, as, it, goes, around, the, periphery, of, a, contoured, workpiece, for, sheet, metal, cutting, the, focal, length, is, usually, 1, 5, 3, inches, 38, 76, mm, advantages, of, laser, cutting, over, mechanical, cutting, include, easier, work, holding, and, reduced, contamination, of, workpiece, since, there, is, no, cutting, edge, which, can, become, contaminated, by, the, material, or, contaminate, the, material, precision, may, be, better, since, the, laser, beam, does, not, wear, during, the, process, there, is, also, a, reduced, chance, of, warping, the, material, that, is, being, cut, as, laser, systems, have, a, small, heat, affected, zone, some, materials, are, also, very, difficult, or, impossible, to, cut, by, more, traditional, means, laser, cutting, for, metals, has, the, advantage, over, plasma, cutting, of, being, more, precise, and, using, less, energy, when, cutting, sheet, metal, however, most, industrial, lasers, cannot, cut, through, the, greater, metal, thickness, that, plasma, can, newer, laser, machines, operating, at, higher, power, 6000, watts, as, contrasted, with, early, laser, cutting, machines, 1500, watt, ratings, are, approaching, plasma, machines, in, their, ability, to, cut, through, thick, materials, but, the, capital, cost, of, such, machines, is, much, higher, than, that, of, plasma, cutting, machines, capable, of, cutting, thick, materials, like, steel, plate, there, are, three, main, types, of, lasers, used, in, laser, cutting, the, co, 2, laser, is, suited, for, cutting, boring, and, engraving, the, neodymium, nd, and, neodymium, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, nd, yag, lasers, are, identical, in, style, and, differ, only, in, the, application, nd, is, used, for, boring, and, where, high, energy, but, low, repetition, are, required, the, nd, yag, laser, is, used, where, very, high, power, is, needed, and, for, boring, and, engraving, both, co, 2, and, nd, nd, yag, lasers, can, be, used, for, welding, co, 2, lasers, are, commonly, pumped, by, passing, a, current, through, the, gas, mix, dc, excited, or, using, radio, frequency, energy, rf, excited, the, rf, method, is, newer, and, has, become, more, popular, since, dc, designs, require, electrodes, inside, the, cavity, they, can, encounter, electrode, erosion, and, plating, of, electrode, material, on, glassware, and, optics, since, rf, resonators, have, external, electrodes, they, are, not, prone, to, those, problems, co, 2, lasers, are, used, for, the, industrial, cutting, of, many, materials, including, titanium, stainless, steel, mild, steel, aluminium, plastic, wood, engineered, wood, wax, fabrics, and, paper, yag, lasers, are, primarily, used, for, cutting, and, scribing, metals, and, ceramics, in, addition, to, the, power, source, the, type, of, gas, flow, can, affect, performance, as, well, common, variants, of, co, 2, lasers, include, fast, axial, flow, slow, axial, flow, transverse, flow, and, slab, in, a, fast, axial, flow, resonator, the, mixture, of, carbon, dioxide, helium, and, nitrogen, is, circulated, at, high, velocity, by, a, turbine, or, blower, transverse, flow, lasers, circulate, the, gas, mix, at, a, lower, velocity, requiring, a, simpler, blower, slab, or, diffusion, cooled, resonators, have, a, static, gas, field, that, requires, no, pressurization, or, glassware, leading, to, savings, on, replacement, turbines, and, glassware, the, laser, generator, and, external, optics, including, the, focus, lens, require, cooling, depending, on, system, size, and, configuration, waste, heat, may, be, transferred, by, a, coolant, or, directly, to, air, water, is, a, commonly, used, coolant, usually, circulated, through, a, chiller, or, heat, transfer, system, a, laser, microjet, is, a, water, jet, guided, laser, in, which, a, pulsed, laser, beam, is, coupled, into, a, low, pressure, water, jet, this, is, used, to, perform, laser, cutting, functions, while, using, the, water, jet, to, guide, the, laser, beam, much, like, an, optical, fiber, through, total, internal, reflection, the, advantages, of, this, are, that, the, water, also, removes, debris, and, cools, the, material, additional, advantages, over, traditional, dry, laser, cutting, are, high, dicing, speeds, parallel, kerf, and, omnidirectional, cutting, fiber, lasers, are, a, type, of, solid, state, laser, that, is, rapidly, growing, within, the, metal, cutting, industry, unlike, co, 2, fiber, technology, utilizes, a, solid, gain, medium, as, opposed, to, a, gas, or, liquid, the, seed, laser, produces, the, laser, beam, and, is, then, amplified, within, a, glass, fiber, with, a, wavelength, of, only, 1064, nanometers, fiber, lasers, produce, an, extremely, small, spot, size, up, to, 100, times, smaller, compared, to, the, co, 2, making, it, ideal, for, cutting, reflective, metal, material, this, is, one, of, the, main, advantages, of, fiber, compared, to, co, 2, fibre, laser, cutter, benefits, include, there, are, many, different, methods, of, cutting, using, lasers, with, different, types, used, to, cut, different, materials, some, of, the, methods, are, vaporization, melt, and, blow, melt, blow, and, burn, thermal, stress, cracking, scribing, cold, cutting, and, burning, stabilized, laser, cutting, in, vaporization, cutting, the, focused, beam, heats, the, surface, of, the, material, to, a, flashpoint, and, generates, a, keyhole, the, keyhole, leads, to, a, sudden, increase, in, absorptivity, quickly, deepening, the, hole, as, the, hole, deepens, and, the, material, boils, vapor, generated, erodes, the, molten, walls, blowing, ejection, out, and, further, enlarging, the, hole, nonmelting, materials, such, as, wood, carbon, and, thermoset, plastics, are, usually, cut, by, this, method, melt, and, blow, or, fusion, cutting, uses, high, pressure, gas, to, blow, molten, material, from, the, cutting, area, greatly, decreasing, the, power, requirement, first, the, material, is, heated, to, melting, point, then, a, gas, jet, blows, the, molten, material, out, of, the, kerf, avoiding, the, need, to, raise, the, temperature, of, the, material, any, further, materials, cut, with, this, process, are, usually, metals, brittle, materials, are, particularly, sensitive, to, thermal, fracture, a, feature, exploited, in, thermal, stress, cracking, a, beam, is, focused, on, the, surface, causing, localized, heating, and, thermal, expansion, this, results, in, a, crack, that, can, then, be, guided, by, moving, the, beam, the, crack, can, be, moved, in, order, of, m, s, it, is, usually, used, in, the, cutting, of, glass, the, separation, of, microelectronic, chips, as, prepared, in, semiconductor, device, fabrication, from, silicon, wafers, may, be, performed, by, the, so, called, stealth, dicing, process, which, operates, with, a, pulsed, nd, yag, laser, the, wavelength, of, which, 1064, nm, is, well, adapted, to, the, electronic, band, gap, of, silicon, 1, 11, ev, or, 1117, nm, reactive, cutting, is, also, called, burning, stabilized, laser, gas, cutting, and, flame, cutting, reactive, cutting, is, like, oxygen, torch, cutting, but, with, a, laser, beam, as, the, ignition, source, mostly, used, for, cutting, carbon, steel, in, thicknesses, over, 1, mm, this, process, can, be, used, to, cut, very, thick, steel, plates, with, relatively, little, laser, power, laser, cutters, have, a, positioning, accuracy, of, 10, micrometers, and, repeatability, of, 5, micrometers, standard, roughness, rz, increases, with, the, sheet, thickness, but, decreases, with, laser, power, and, cutting, speed, when, cutting, low, carbon, steel, with, laser, power, of, 800, w, standard, roughness, rz, is, 10, m, for, sheet, thickness, of, 1, mm, 20, m, for, 3, mm, and, 25, m, for, 6, mm, r, z, 12, 528, s, 0, 542, p, 0, 528, v, 0, 322, displaystyle, rz, frac, 12, 528, cdot, s, 0, 542, p, 0, 528, cdot, v, 0, 322, where, s, displaystyle, s, steel, sheet, thickness, in, mm, p, displaystyle, p, laser, power, in, kw, some, new, laser, cutters, have, laser, power, of, 4, kw, v, displaystyle, v, cutting, speed, in, meters, per, minute, this, process, is, capable, of, holding, quite, close, tolerances, often, to, within, 0, 001, inch, 0, 025, mm, part, geometry, and, the, mechanical, soundness, of, the, machine, have, much, to, do, with, tolerance, capabilities, the, typical, surface, finish, resulting, from, laser, beam, cutting, may, range, from, 125, to, 250, micro, inches, 0, 003, mm, to, 0, 006, mm, there, are, generally, three, different, configurations, of, industrial, laser, cutting, machines, moving, material, hybrid, and, flying, optics, systems, these, refer, to, the, way, that, the, laser, beam, is, moved, over, the, material, to, be, cut, or, processed, for, all, of, these, the, axes, of, motion, are, typically, designated, x, and, y, axis, if, the, cutting, head, may, be, controlled, it, is, designated, as, the, z, axis, moving, material, lasers, have, a, stationary, cutting, head, and, move, the, material, under, it, this, method, provides, a, constant, distance, from, the, laser, generator, to, the, workpiece, and, a, single, point, from, which, to, remove, cutting, effluent, it, requires, fewer, optics, but, requires, moving, the, workpiece, this, style, of, machine, tends, to, have, the, fewest, beam, delivery, optics, but, also, tends, to, be, the, slowest, hybrid, lasers, provide, a, table, that, moves, in, one, axis, usually, the, x, axis, and, moves, the, head, along, the, shorter, y, axis, this, results, in, a, more, constant, beam, delivery, path, length, than, a, flying, optic, machine, and, may, permit, a, simpler, beam, delivery, system, this, can, result, in, reduced, power, loss, in, the, delivery, system, and, more, capacity, per, watt, than, flying, optics, machines, flying, optics, lasers, feature, a, stationary, table, and, a, cutting, head, with, a, laser, beam, that, moves, over, the, workpiece, in, both, of, the, horizontal, dimensions, flying, optics, cutters, keep, the, workpiece, stationary, during, processing, and, often, do, not, require, material, clamping, the, moving, mass, is, constant, so, dynamics, are, not, affected, by, varying, the, size, of, the, workpiece, flying, optics, machines, are, the, fastest, type, which, is, advantageous, when, cutting, thinner, workpieces, flying, optic, machines, must, use, some, method, to, take, into, account, the, changing, beam, length, from, the, near, field, close, to, the, resonator, cutting, to, the, far, field, far, away, from, the, resonator, cutting, common, methods, for, controlling, this, include, collimation, adaptive, optics, or, the, use, of, a, constant, beam, length, axis, five, and, six, axis, machines, also, permit, cutting, formed, workpieces, in, addition, there, are, various, methods, of, orienting, the, laser, beam, to, a, shaped, workpiece, maintaining, a, proper, focus, distance, and, nozzle, standoff, pulsed, lasers, which, provide, a, high, power, burst, of, energy, for, a, short, period, are, very, effective, in, some, laser, cutting, processes, particularly, for, piercing, or, when, very, small, holes, or, very, low, cutting, speeds, are, required, since, if, a, constant, laser, beam, were, used, the, heat, could, reach, the, point, of, melting, the, whole, piece, being, cut, most, industrial, lasers, have, the, ability, to, pulse, or, cut, cw, continuous, wave, under, nc, numerical, control, program, control, double, pulse, lasers, use, a, series, of, pulse, pairs, to, improve, material, removal, rate, and, hole, quality, essentially, the, first, pulse, removes, material, from, the, surface, and, the, second, prevents, the, ejecta, from, adhering, to, the, side, of, the, hole, or, cut, the, main, disadvantage, of, laser, cutting, is, the, high, power, consumption, industrial, laser, efficiency, may, range, from, 5, to, 45, the, power, consumption, and, efficiency, of, any, particular, laser, will, vary, depending, on, output, power, and, operating, parameters, this, will, depend, on, the, type, of, laser, and, how, well, the, laser, is, matched, to, the, work, at, hand, the, amount, of, laser, cutting, power, required, known, as, heat, input, for, a, particular, job, depends, on, the, material, type, thickness, process, reactive, inert, used, and, desired, cutting, rate, the, maximum, cutting, rate, production, rate, is, limited, by, a, number, of, factors, including, laser, power, material, thickness, process, type, reactive, or, inert, and, material, properties, common, industrial, systems, 1, kw, will, cut, carbon, steel, metal, from, 0, 51, 13, mm, in, thickness, for, many, purposes, a, laser, can, be, up, to, thirty, times, faster, than, standard, sawing
