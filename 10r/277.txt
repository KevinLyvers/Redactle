a, column, or, pillar, in, architecture, and, structural, engineering, is, a, structural, element, that, transmits, through, compression, the, weight, of, the, structure, above, to, other, structural, elements, below, in, other, words, a, column, is, a, compression, member, the, term, column, applies, especially, to, a, large, round, support, the, shaft, of, the, column, with, a, capital, and, a, base, or, pedestal, which, is, made, of, stone, or, appearing, to, be, so, a, small, wooden, or, metal, support, is, typically, called, a, post, supports, with, a, rectangular, or, other, non, round, section, are, usually, called, piers, for, the, purpose, of, wind, or, earthquake, engineering, columns, may, be, designed, to, resist, lateral, forces, other, compression, members, are, often, termed, columns, because, of, the, similar, stress, conditions, columns, are, frequently, used, to, support, beams, or, arches, on, which, the, upper, parts, of, walls, or, ceilings, rest, in, architecture, column, refers, to, such, a, structural, element, that, also, has, certain, proportional, and, decorative, features, these, beautiful, columns, are, available, in, a, broad, selection, of, styles, and, designs, in, round, tapered, round, straight, or, square, shaft, styles, a, column, might, also, be, a, decorative, element, not, needed, for, structural, purposes, many, columns, are, engaged, that, is, to, say, form, part, of, a, wall, a, long, sequence, of, columns, joined, by, an, entablature, is, known, as, a, colonnade, all, significant, iron, age, civilizations, of, the, near, east, and, mediterranean, made, some, use, of, columns, in, ancient, egyptian, architecture, as, early, as, 2600, bc, the, architect, imhotep, made, use, of, stone, columns, whose, surface, was, carved, to, reflect, the, organic, form, of, bundled, reeds, like, papyrus, lotus, and, palm, in, later, egyptian, architecture, faceted, cylinders, were, also, common, their, form, is, thought, to, derive, from, archaic, reed, built, shrines, carved, from, stone, the, columns, were, highly, decorated, with, carved, and, painted, hieroglyphs, texts, ritual, imagery, and, natural, motifs, egyptian, columns, are, famously, present, in, the, great, hypostyle, hall, of, karnak, c, 1224, bc, where, 134, columns, are, lined, up, in, sixteen, rows, with, some, columns, reaching, heights, of, 24, metres, one, of, the, most, important, type, are, the, papyriform, columns, the, origin, of, these, columns, goes, back, to, the, 5th, dynasty, they, are, composed, of, lotus, papyrus, stems, which, are, drawn, together, into, a, bundle, decorated, with, bands, the, capital, instead, of, opening, out, into, the, shape, of, a, bellflower, swells, out, and, then, narrows, again, like, a, flower, in, bud, the, base, which, tapers, to, take, the, shape, of, a, half, sphere, like, the, stem, of, the, lotus, has, a, continuously, recurring, decoration, of, stipules, the, minoans, used, whole, tree, trunks, usually, turned, upside, down, in, order, to, prevent, re, growth, stood, on, a, base, set, in, the, stylobate, floor, base, and, topped, by, a, simple, round, capital, these, were, then, painted, as, in, the, most, famous, minoan, palace, of, knossos, the, minoans, employed, columns, to, create, large, open, plan, spaces, light, wells, and, as, a, focal, point, for, religious, rituals, these, traditions, were, continued, by, the, later, mycenaean, civilization, particularly, in, the, megaron, or, hall, at, the, heart, of, their, palaces, the, importance, of, columns, and, their, reference, to, palaces, and, therefore, authority, is, evidenced, in, their, use, in, heraldic, motifs, such, as, the, famous, lion, gate, of, mycenae, where, two, lions, stand, each, side, of, a, column, being, made, of, wood, these, early, columns, have, not, survived, but, their, stone, bases, have, and, through, these, we, may, see, their, use, and, arrangement, in, these, palace, buildings, the, egyptians, persians, and, other, civilizations, mostly, used, columns, for, the, practical, purpose, of, holding, up, the, roof, inside, a, building, preferring, outside, walls, to, be, decorated, with, reliefs, or, painting, but, the, ancient, greeks, followed, by, the, romans, loved, to, use, them, on, the, outside, as, well, and, the, extensive, use, of, columns, on, the, interior, and, exterior, of, buildings, is, one, of, the, most, characteristic, features, of, classical, architecture, in, buildings, like, the, parthenon, the, greeks, developed, the, classical, orders, of, architecture, which, are, most, easily, distinguished, by, the, form, of, the, column, and, its, various, elements, their, doric, ionic, and, corinthian, orders, were, expanded, by, the, romans, to, include, the, tuscan, and, composite, orders, some, of, the, most, elaborate, columns, in, the, ancient, world, were, those, of, the, persians, especially, the, massive, stone, columns, erected, in, persepolis, they, included, double, bull, structures, in, their, capitals, the, hall, of, hundred, columns, at, persepolis, measuring, 70, 70, metres, was, built, by, the, achaemenid, king, darius, i, 524, 486, bc, many, of, the, ancient, persian, columns, are, standing, some, being, more, than, 30, metres, tall, tall, columns, with, bull, s, head, capitals, were, used, for, porticoes, and, to, support, the, roofs, of, the, hypostylehall, partly, inspired, by, the, ancient, egyptian, precedent, since, the, columns, carried, timber, beams, rather, than, stone, they, could, be, taller, slimmer, and, more, widely, spaced, than, egyptian, ones, columns, or, at, least, large, structural, exterior, ones, became, much, less, significant, in, the, architecture, of, the, middle, ages, the, classical, forms, were, abandoned, in, both, byzantine, and, romanesque, architecture, in, favour, of, more, flexible, forms, with, capitals, often, using, various, types, of, foliage, decoration, and, in, the, west, scenes, with, figures, carved, in, relief, during, the, romanesque, period, builders, continued, to, reuse, and, imitate, ancient, roman, columns, wherever, possible, where, new, the, emphasis, was, on, elegance, and, beauty, as, illustrated, by, twisted, columns, often, they, were, decorated, with, mosaics, renaissance, architecture, was, keen, to, revive, the, classical, vocabulary, and, styles, and, the, informed, use, and, variation, of, the, classical, orders, remained, fundamental, to, the, training, of, architects, throughout, baroque, rococo, and, neo, classical, architecture, early, columns, were, constructed, of, stone, some, out, of, a, single, piece, of, stone, monolithic, columns, are, among, the, heaviest, stones, used, in, architecture, other, stone, columns, are, created, out, of, multiple, sections, of, stone, mortared, or, dry, fit, together, in, many, classical, sites, sectioned, columns, were, carved, with, a, centre, hole, or, depression, so, that, they, could, be, pegged, together, using, stone, or, metal, pins, the, design, of, most, classical, columns, incorporates, entasis, the, inclusion, of, a, slight, outward, curve, in, the, sides, plus, a, reduction, in, diameter, along, the, height, of, the, column, so, that, the, top, is, as, little, as, 83, of, the, bottom, diameter, this, reduction, mimics, the, parallax, effects, which, the, eye, expects, to, see, and, tends, to, make, columns, look, taller, and, straighter, than, they, are, while, entasis, adds, to, that, effect, there, are, flutes, and, fillets, that, run, up, the, shaft, of, columns, the, flute, is, the, part, of, the, column, that, is, indented, in, with, a, semi, circular, shape, the, fillet, of, the, column, is, the, part, between, each, of, the, flutes, on, the, ionic, order, columns, the, flute, width, changes, on, all, tapered, columns, as, it, goes, up, the, shaft, and, stays, the, same, on, all, non, tapered, columns, this, was, done, to, the, columns, to, add, visual, interest, to, them, the, ionic, and, the, corinthian, are, the, only, orders, that, have, fillets, and, flutes, the, doric, style, has, flutes, but, not, fillets, doric, flutes, are, connected, at, a, sharp, point, where, the, fillets, are, located, on, ionic, and, corinthian, order, columns, most, classical, columns, arise, from, a, basis, or, base, that, rests, on, the, stylobate, or, foundation, except, for, those, of, the, doric, order, which, usually, rest, directly, on, the, stylobate, the, basis, may, consist, of, several, elements, beginning, with, a, wide, square, slab, known, as, a, plinth, the, simplest, bases, consist, of, the, plinth, alone, sometimes, separated, from, the, column, by, a, convex, circular, cushion, known, as, a, torus, more, elaborate, bases, include, two, toruses, separated, by, a, concave, section, or, channel, known, as, a, scotia, or, trochilus, scotiae, could, also, occur, in, pairs, separated, by, a, convex, section, called, an, astragal, or, bead, narrower, than, a, torus, sometimes, these, sections, were, accompanied, by, still, narrower, convex, sections, known, as, annulets, or, fillets, at, the, top, of, the, shaft, is, a, capital, upon, which, the, roof, or, other, architectural, elements, rest, in, the, case, of, doric, columns, the, capital, usually, consists, of, a, round, tapering, cushion, or, echinus, supporting, a, square, slab, known, as, an, abax, or, abacus, ionic, capitals, feature, a, pair, of, volutes, or, scrolls, while, corinthian, capitals, are, decorated, with, reliefs, in, the, form, of, acanthus, leaves, either, type, of, capital, could, be, accompanied, by, the, same, moldings, as, the, base, in, the, case, of, free, standing, columns, the, decorative, elements, atop, the, shaft, are, known, as, a, finial, modern, columns, may, be, constructed, out, of, steel, poured, or, precast, concrete, or, brick, left, bare, or, clad, in, an, architectural, covering, or, veneer, used, to, support, an, arch, an, impost, or, pier, is, the, topmost, member, of, a, column, the, bottom, most, part, of, the, arch, called, the, springing, rests, on, the, impost, as, the, axial, load, on, a, perfectly, straight, slender, column, with, elastic, material, properties, is, increased, in, magnitude, this, ideal, column, passes, through, three, states, stable, equilibrium, neutral, equilibrium, and, instability, the, straight, column, under, load, is, in, stable, equilibrium, if, a, lateral, force, applied, between, the, two, ends, of, the, column, produces, a, small, lateral, deflection, which, disappears, and, the, column, returns, to, its, straight, form, when, the, lateral, force, is, removed, if, the, column, load, is, gradually, increased, a, condition, is, reached, in, which, the, straight, form, of, equilibrium, becomes, so, called, neutral, equilibrium, and, a, small, lateral, force, will, produce, a, deflection, that, does, not, disappear, and, the, column, remains, in, this, slightly, bent, form, when, the, lateral, force, is, removed, the, load, at, which, neutral, equilibrium, of, a, column, is, reached, is, called, the, critical, or, buckling, load, the, state, of, instability, is, reached, when, a, slight, increase, of, the, column, load, causes, uncontrollably, growing, lateral, deflections, leading, to, complete, collapse, for, an, axially, loaded, straight, column, with, any, end, support, conditions, the, equation, of, static, equilibrium, in, the, form, of, a, differential, equation, can, be, solved, for, the, deflected, shape, and, critical, load, of, the, column, with, hinged, fixed, or, free, end, support, conditions, the, deflected, shape, in, neutral, equilibrium, of, an, initially, straight, column, with, uniform, cross, section, throughout, its, length, always, follows, a, partial, or, composite, sinusoidal, curve, shape, and, the, critical, load, is, given, by, f, c, r, 2, e, i, m, i, n, l, 2, 1, displaystyle, f, cr, equiv, frac, pi, 2, textit, e, i, min, l, 2, qquad, 1, where, e, elastic, modulus, of, the, material, i, min, the, minimal, moment, of, inertia, of, the, cross, section, and, l, actual, length, of, the, column, between, its, two, end, supports, a, variant, of, 1, is, given, by, f, c, r, 2, e, t, k, l, r, 2, 2, displaystyle, f, cr, equiv, frac, pi, 2, e, t, frac, kl, r, 2, qquad, 2, where, r, radius, of, gyration, of, column, cross, section, which, is, equal, to, the, square, root, of, i, a, k, ratio, of, the, longest, half, sine, wave, to, the, actual, column, length, e, t, tangent, modulus, at, the, stress, f, cr, and, kl, effective, length, length, of, an, equivalent, hinged, hinged, column, from, equation, 2, it, can, be, noted, that, the, buckling, strength, of, a, column, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, its, length, when, the, critical, stress, f, cr, f, cr, p, cr, a, where, a, cross, sectional, area, of, the, column, is, greater, than, the, proportional, limit, of, the, material, the, column, is, experiencing, inelastic, buckling, since, at, this, stress, the, slope, of, the, material, s, stress, strain, curve, e, t, called, the, tangent, modulus, is, smaller, than, that, below, the, proportional, limit, the, critical, load, at, inelastic, buckling, is, reduced, more, complex, formulas, and, procedures, apply, for, such, cases, but, in, its, simplest, form, the, critical, buckling, load, formula, is, given, as, equation, 3, f, c, r, f, y, f, y, 2, 4,

torsional, buckling, sudden, twisting, before, or, in, combination, with, lateral, buckling, the, presence, of, the, twisting, deformations, renders, both, theoretical, analyses, and, practical, designs, rather, complex, eccentricity, of, the, load, or, imperfections, such, as, initial, crookedness, decreases, column, strength, if, the, axial, load, on, the, column, is, not, concentric, that, is, its, line, of, action, is, not, precisely, coincident, with, the, centroidal, axis, of, the, column, the, column, is, characterized, as, eccentrically, loaded, the, eccentricity, of, the, load, or, an, initial, curvature, subjects, the, column, to, immediate, bending, the, increased, stresses, due, to, the, combined, axial, plus, flexural, stresses, result, in, a, reduced, load, carrying, ability, column, elements, are, considered, to, be, massive, if, their, smallest, side, dimension, is, equal, to, or, more, than, 400, mm, massive, columns, have, the, ability, to, increase, in, carrying, strength, over, long, time, periods, even, during, periods, of, heavy, load, taking, into, account, the, fact, that, possible, structural, loads, may, increase, over, time, as, well, and, also, the, threat, of, progressive, failure, massive, columns, have, an, advantage, compared, to, non, massive, ones, when, a, column, is, too, long, to, be, built, or, transported, in, one, piece, it, has, to, be, extended, or, spliced, at, the, construction, site, a, reinforced, concrete, column, is, extended, by, having, the, steel, reinforcing, bars, protrude, a, few, inches, or, feet, above, the, top, of, the, concrete, then, placing, the, next, level, of, reinforcing, bars, to, overlap, and, pouring, the, concrete, of, the, next, level, a, steel, column, is, extended, by, welding, or, bolting, splice, plates, on, the, flanges, and, webs, or, walls, of, the, columns, to, provide, a, few, inches, or, feet, of, load, transfer, from, the, upper, to, the, lower, column, section, a, timber, column, is, usually, extended, by, the, use, of, a, steel, tube, or, wrapped, around, sheet, metal, plate, bolted, onto, the, two, connecting, timber, sections, a, column, that, carries, the, load, down, to, a, foundation, must, have, means, to, transfer, the, load, without, overstressing, the, foundation, material, reinforced, concrete, and, masonry, columns, are, generally, built, directly, on, top, of, concrete, foundations, when, seated, on, a, concrete, foundation, a, steel, column, must, have, a, base, plate, to, spread, the, load, over, a, larger, area, and, thereby, reduce, the, bearing, pressure, the, base, plate, is, a, thick, rectangular, steel, plate, usually, welded, to, the, bottom, end, of, the, column, the, roman, author, vitruvius, relying, on, the, writings, now, lost, of, greek, authors, tells, us, that, the, ancient, greeks, believed, that, their, doric, order, developed, from, techniques, for, building, in, wood, the, earlier, smoothed, tree, trunk, was, replaced, by, a, stone, cylinder, the, doric, order, is, the, oldest, and, simplest, of, the, classical, orders, it, is, composed, of, a, vertical, cylinder, that, is, wider, at, the, bottom, it, generally, has, neither, a, base, nor, a, detailed, capital, it, is, instead, often, topped, with, an, inverted, frustum, of, a, shallow, cone, or, a, cylindrical, band, of, carvings, it, is, often, referred, to, as, the, masculine, order, because, it, is, represented, in, the, bottom, level, of, the, colosseum, and, the, parthenon, and, was, therefore, considered, to, be, able, to, hold, more, weight, the, height, to, thickness, ratio, is, about, 8, 1, the, shaft, of, a, doric, column, is, almost, always, fluted, the, greek, doric, developed, in, the, western, dorian, region, of, greece, is, the, heaviest, and, most, massive, of, the, orders, it, rises, from, the, stylobate, without, any, base, it, is, from, four, to, six, times, as, tall, as, its, diameter, it, has, twenty, broad, flutes, the, capital, consists, simply, of, a, banded, necking, swelling, out, into, a, smooth, echinus, which, carries, a, flat, square, abacus, the, doric, entablature, is, also, the, heaviest, being, about, one, fourth, the, height, column, the, greek, doric, order, was, not, used, after, c, 100, b, c, until, its, rediscovery, in, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, tuscan, order, also, known, as, roman, doric, is, also, a, simple, design, the, base, and, capital, both, being, series, of, cylindrical, disks, of, alternating, diameter, the, shaft, is, almost, never, fluted, the, proportions, vary, but, are, generally, similar, to, doric, columns, height, to, width, ratio, is, about, 7, 1, the, ionic, column, is, considerably, more, complex, than, the, doric, or, tuscan, it, usually, has, a, base, and, the, shaft, is, often, fluted, it, has, grooves, carved, up, its, length, the, capital, features, a, volute, an, ornament, shaped, like, a, scroll, at, the, four, corners, the, height, to, thickness, ratio, is, around, 9, 1, due, to, the, more, refined, proportions, and, scroll, capitals, the, ionic, column, is, sometimes, associated, with, academic, buildings, ionic, style, columns, were, used, on, the, second, level, of, the, colosseum, the, corinthian, order, is, named, for, the, greek, city, state, of, corinth, to, which, it, was, connected, in, the, period, however, according, to, the, architectural, historian, vitruvius, the, column, was, created, by, the, sculptor, callimachus, probably, an, athenian, who, drew, acanthus, leaves, growing, around, a, votive, basket, in, fact, the, oldest, known, corinthian, capital, was, found, in, bassae, dated, at, 427, bc, it, is, sometimes, called, the, feminine, order, because, it, is, on, the, top, level, of, the, colosseum, and, holding, up, the, least, weight, and, also, has, the, slenderest, ratio, of, thickness, to, height, height, to, width, ratio, is, about, 10, 1, the, composite, order, draws, its, name, from, the, capital, being, a, composite, of, the, ionic, and, corinthian, capitals, the, acanthus, of, the, corinthian, column, already, has, a, scroll, like, element, so, the, distinction, is, sometimes, subtle, generally, the, composite, is, similar, to, the, corinthian, in, proportion, and, employment, often, in, the, upper, tiers, of, colonnades, height, to, width, ratio, is, about, 11, 1, or, 12, 1, a, solomonic, column, sometimes, called, barley, sugar, begins, on, a, base, and, ends, in, a, capital, which, may, be, of, any, order, but, the, shaft, twists, in, a, tight, spiral, producing, a, dramatic, serpentine, effect, of, movement, solomonic, columns, were, developed, in, the, ancient, world, but, remained, rare, there, a, famous, marble, set, probably, 2nd, century, was, brought, to, old, st, peter, s, basilica, by, constantine, i, and, placed, round, the, saint, s, shrine, and, was, thus, familiar, throughout, the, middle, ages, by, which, time, they, were, thought, to, have, been, removed, from, the, temple, of, jerusalem, the, style, was, used, in, bronze, by, bernini, for, his, spectacular, st, peter, s, baldachin, actually, a, ciborium, which, displaced, constantine, s, columns, and, thereafter, became, very, popular, with, baroque, and, rococo, church, architects, above, all, in, latin, america, where, they, were, very, often, used, especially, on, a, small, scale, as, they, are, easy, to, produce, in, wood, by, turning, on, a, lathe, hence, also, the, style, s, popularity, for, spindles, on, furniture, and, stairs, a, caryatid, is, a, sculpted, female, figure, serving, as, an, architectural, support, taking, the, place, of, a, column, or, a, pillar, supporting, an, entablature, on, her, head, the, greek, term, karyatides, literally, means, maidens, of, karyai, an, ancient, town, of, peloponnese, in, architecture, an, engaged, column, is, a, column, embedded, in, a, wall, and, partly, projecting, from, the, surface, of, the, wall, sometimes, defined, as, semi, or, three, quarter, detached, engaged, columns, are, rarely, found, in, classical, greek, architecture, and, then, only, in, exceptional, cases, but, in, roman, architecture, they, exist, in, abundance, most, commonly, embedded, in, the, cella, walls, of, pseudoperipteral, buildings, pillar, tombs, are, monumental, graves, which, typically, feature, a, single, prominent, pillar, or, column, often, made, of, stone, a, number, of, world, cultures, incorporated, pillars, into, tomb, structures, in, the, ancient, greek, colony, of, lycia, in, anatolia, one, of, these, edifices, is, located, at, the, tomb, of, xanthos, in, the, town, of, hannassa, in, southern, somalia, ruins, of, houses, with, archways, and, courtyards, have, also, been, found, along, with, other, pillar, tombs, including, a, rare, octagonal, tomb, chisholm, hugh, ed, 1911, engaged, column, encyclop, dia, britannica, 9, 11th, ed, cambridge, university, press, pp, 404, 405,
