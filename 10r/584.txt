a, mirror, also, known, as, a, looking, glass, is, an, object, that, reflects, an, image, light, that, bounces, off, a, mirror, will, show, an, image, of, whatever, is, in, front, of, it, when, focused, through, the, lens, of, the, eye, or, a, camera, mirrors, reverse, the, direction, of, the, image, in, an, equal, yet, opposite, angle, from, which, the, light, shines, upon, it, this, allows, the, viewer, to, see, themselves, or, objects, behind, them, or, even, objects, that, are, at, an, angle, from, them, but, out, of, their, field, of, view, such, as, around, a, corner, natural, mirrors, have, existed, since, prehistoric, times, such, as, the, surface, of, water, but, people, have, been, manufacturing, mirrors, out, of, a, variety, of, materials, for, thousands, of, years, like, stone, metals, and, glass, in, modern, mirrors, metals, like, silver, or, aluminium, are, often, used, due, to, their, high, reflectivity, applied, as, a, thin, coating, on, glass, because, of, its, naturally, smooth, and, very, hard, surface, a, mirror, is, a, wave, reflector, light, consists, of, waves, and, when, light, waves, reflect, from, the, flat, surface, of, a, mirror, those, waves, retain, the, same, degree, of, curvature, and, vergence, in, an, equal, yet, opposite, direction, as, the, original, waves, this, allows, the, waves, to, form, an, image, when, they, are, focused, through, a, lens, just, as, if, the, waves, had, originated, from, the, direction, of, the, mirror, the, light, can, also, be, pictured, as, rays, imaginary, lines, radiating, from, the, light, source, that, are, always, perpendicular, to, the, waves, these, rays, are, reflected, at, an, equal, yet, opposite, angle, from, which, they, strike, the, mirror, incident, light, this, property, called, specular, reflection, distinguishes, a, mirror, from, objects, that, diffuse, light, breaking, up, the, wave, and, scattering, it, in, many, directions, such, as, flat, white, paint, thus, a, mirror, can, be, any, surface, in, which, the, texture, or, roughness, of, the, surface, is, smaller, smoother, than, the, wavelength, of, the, waves, when, looking, at, a, mirror, one, will, see, a, mirror, image, or, reflected, image, of, objects, in, the, environment, formed, by, light, emitted, or, scattered, by, them, and, reflected, by, the, mirror, towards, one, s, eyes, this, effect, gives, the, illusion, that, those, objects, are, behind, the, mirror, or, sometimes, in, front, of, it, when, the, surface, is, not, flat, a, mirror, may, behave, like, a, reflecting, lens, a, plane, mirror, yields, a, real, looking, undistorted, image, while, a, curved, mirror, may, distort, magnify, or, reduce, the, image, in, various, ways, while, keeping, the, lines, contrast, sharpness, colors, and, other, image, properties, intact, a, mirror, is, commonly, used, for, inspecting, oneself, such, as, during, personal, grooming, hence, the, old, fashioned, name, looking, glass, this, use, which, dates, from, prehistory, overlaps, with, uses, in, decoration, and, architecture, mirrors, are, also, used, to, view, other, items, that, are, not, directly, visible, because, of, obstructions, examples, include, rear, view, mirrors, in, vehicles, security, mirrors, in, or, around, buildings, and, dentist, s, mirrors, mirrors, are, also, used, in, optical, and, scientific, apparatus, such, as, telescopes, lasers, cameras, periscopes, and, industrial, machinery, according, to, superstitions, breaking, a, mirror, is, said, to, bring, seven, years, of, bad, luck, the, terms, mirror, and, reflector, can, be, used, for, objects, that, reflect, any, other, types, of, waves, an, acoustic, mirror, reflects, sound, waves, objects, such, as, walls, ceilings, or, natural, rock, formations, may, produce, echos, and, this, tendency, often, becomes, a, problem, in, acoustical, engineering, when, designing, houses, auditoriums, or, recording, studios, acoustic, mirrors, may, be, used, for, applications, such, as, parabolic, microphones, atmospheric, studies, sonar, and, seafloor, mapping, an, atomic, mirror, reflects, matter, waves, and, can, be, used, for, atomic, interferometry, and, atomic, holography, the, first, mirrors, used, by, humans, were, most, likely, pools, of, still, water, or, shiny, stones, the, requirements, for, making, a, good, mirror, are, a, surface, with, a, very, high, degree, of, flatness, preferably, but, not, necessarily, with, high, reflectivity, and, a, surface, roughness, smaller, than, the, wavelength, of, the, light, the, earliest, manufactured, mirrors, were, pieces, of, polished, stone, such, as, obsidian, a, naturally, occurring, volcanic, glass, examples, of, obsidian, mirrors, found, at, atalh, y, k, in, anatolia, modern, day, turkey, have, been, dated, to, around, 6000, bce, mirrors, of, polished, copper, were, crafted, in, mesopotamia, from, 4000, bce, and, in, ancient, egypt, from, around, 3000, bce, polished, stone, mirrors, from, central, and, south, america, date, from, around, 2000, bce, onwards, by, the, bronze, age, most, cultures, were, using, mirrors, made, from, polished, discs, of, bronze, copper, silver, or, other, metals, the, people, of, kerma, in, nubia, were, skilled, in, the, manufacturing, of, mirrors, remains, of, their, bronze, kilns, have, been, found, within, the, temple, of, kerma, in, china, bronze, mirrors, were, manufactured, from, around, 2000, bc, some, of, the, earliest, bronze, and, copper, examples, being, produced, by, the, qijia, culture, such, metal, mirrors, remained, the, norm, through, to, greco, roman, antiquity, and, throughout, the, middle, ages, in, europe, during, the, roman, empire, silver, mirrors, were, in, wide, use, by, servants, speculum, metal, is, a, highly, reflective, alloy, of, copper, and, tin, that, was, used, for, mirrors, until, a, couple, of, centuries, ago, such, mirrors, may, have, originated, in, china, and, india, mirrors, of, speculum, metal, or, any, precious, metal, were, hard, to, produce, and, were, only, owned, by, the, wealthy, common, metal, mirrors, tarnished, and, required, frequent, polishing, bronze, mirrors, had, low, reflectivity, and, poor, color, rendering, and, stone, mirrors, were, much, worse, in, this, regard, p, 11, these, defects, explain, the, new, testament, reference, in, 1, corinthians, 13, to, seeing, as, in, a, mirror, darkly, the, greek, philosopher, socrates, urged, young, people, to, look, at, themselves, in, mirrors, so, that, if, they, were, beautiful, they, would, become, worthy, of, their, beauty, and, if, they, were, ugly, they, would, know, how, to, hide, their, disgrace, through, learning, p, 106, glass, began, to, be, used, for, mirrors, in, the, 1st, century, ce, with, the, development, of, soda, lime, glass, and, glass, blowing, the, roman, scholar, pliny, the, elder, claims, that, artisans, in, sidon, modern, day, lebanon, were, producing, glass, mirrors, coated, with, lead, or, gold, leaf, in, the, back, the, metal, provided, good, reflectivity, and, the, glass, provided, a, smooth, surface, and, protected, the, metal, from, scratches, and, tarnishing, p, 12, however, there, is, no, archeological, evidence, of, glass, mirrors, before, the, third, century, these, early, glass, mirrors, were, made, by, blowing, a, glass, bubble, and, then, cutting, off, a, small, circular, section, from, 10, to, 20, cm, in, diameter, their, surface, was, either, concave, or, convex, and, imperfections, tended, to, distort, the, image, lead, coated, mirrors, were, very, thin, to, prevent, cracking, by, the, heat, of, the, molten, metal, p, 10, due, to, the, poor, quality, high, cost, and, small, size, of, glass, mirrors, solid, metal, mirrors, primarily, of, steel, remained, in, common, use, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, p, 13, silver, coated, metal, mirrors, were, developed, in, china, as, early, as, 500, ce, the, bare, metal, was, coated, with, an, amalgam, then, heated, until, the, mercury, boiled, away, the, evolution, of, glass, mirrors, in, the, middle, ages, followed, improvements, in, glassmaking, technology, glassmakers, in, france, made, flat, glass, plates, by, blowing, glass, bubbles, spinning, them, rapidly, to, flatten, them, and, cutting, rectangles, out, of, them, a, better, method, developed, in, germany, and, perfected, in, venice, by, the, 16th, century, was, to, blow, a, cylinder, of, glass, cut, off, the, ends, slice, it, along, its, length, and, unroll, it, onto, a, flat, hot, plate, p, 11, venetian, glassmakers, also, adopted, lead, glass, for, mirrors, because, of, its, crystal, clarity, and, its, easier, workability, during, the, early, european, renaissance, a, fire, gilding, technique, developed, to, produce, an, even, and, highly, reflective, tin, coating, for, glass, mirrors, the, back, of, the, glass, was, coated, with, a, tin, mercury, amalgam, and, the, mercury, was, then, evaporated, by, heating, the, piece, this, process, caused, less, thermal, shock, to, the, glass, than, the, older, molten, lead, method, p, 16, the, date, and, location, of, the, discovery, is, unknown, but, by, the, 16th, century, venice, was, a, center, of, mirror, production, using, this, technique, these, venetian, mirrors, were, up, to, 40, inches, 100, cm, square, for, a, century, venice, retained, the, monopoly, of, the, tin, amalgam, technique, venetian, mirrors, in, richly, decorated, frames, served, as, luxury, decorations, for, palaces, throughout, europe, and, were, very, expensive, for, example, in, the, late, seventeenth, century, the, countess, de, fiesque, was, reported, to, have, traded, an, entire, wheat, farm, for, a, mirror, considering, it, a, bargain, however, by, the, end, of, that, century, the, secret, was, leaked, through, industrial, espionage, french, workshops, succeeded, in, large, scale, industrialization, of, the, process, eventually, making, mirrors, affordable, to, the, masses, in, spite, of, the, toxicity, of, mercury, s, vapor, the, invention, of, the, ribbon, machine, in, the, late, industrial, revolution, allowed, modern, glass, panes, to, be, produced, in, bulk, the, saint, gobain, factory, founded, by, royal, initiative, in, france, was, an, important, manufacturer, and, bohemian, and, german, glass, often, rather, cheaper, was, also, important, the, invention, of, the, silvered, glass, mirror, is, credited, to, german, chemist, justus, von, liebig, in, 1835, his, wet, deposition, process, involved, the, deposition, of, a, thin, layer, of, metallic, silver, onto, glass, through, the, chemical, reduction, of, silver, nitrate, this, silvering, process, was, adapted, for, mass, manufacturing, and, led, to, the, greater, availability, of, affordable, mirrors, mirrors, are, often, produced, by, the, wet, deposition, of, silver, or, sometimes, nickel, or, chromium, the, latter, used, most, often, in, automotive, mirrors, via, electroplating, directly, onto, the, glass, substrate, glass, mirrors, for, optical, instruments, are, usually, produced, by, vacuum, deposition, methods, these, techniques, can, be, traced, to, observations, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, that, metal, was, being, ejected, from, electrodes, in, gas, discharge, lamps, and, condensed, on, the, glass, walls, forming, a, mirror, like, coating, the, phenomenon, called, sputtering, was, developed, into, an, industrial, metal, coating, method, with, the, development, of, semiconductor, technology, in, the, 1970s, a, similar, phenomenon, had, been, observed, with, incandescent, light, bulbs, the, metal, in, the, hot, filament, would, slowly, sublimate, and, condense, on, the, bulb, s, walls, this, phenomenon, was, developed, into, the, method, of, evaporation, coating, by, pohl, and, pringsheim, in, 1912, john, d, strong, used, evaporation, coating, to, make, the, first, aluminium, coated, telescope, mirrors, in, the, 1930s, the, first, dielectric, mirror, was, created, in, 1937, by, auwarter, using, evaporated, rhodium, the, metal, coating, of, glass, mirrors, is, usually, protected, from, abrasion, and, corrosion, by, a, layer, of, paint, applied, over, it, mirrors, for, optical, instruments, often, have, the, metal, layer, on, the, front, face, so, that, the, light, does, not, have, to, cross, the, glass, twice, in, these, mirrors, the, metal, may, be, protected, by, a, thin, transparent, coating, of, a, non, metallic, dielectric, material, the, first, metallic, mirror, to, be, enhanced, with, a, dielectric, coating, of, silicon, dioxide, was, created, by, hass, in, 1937, in, 1939, at, the, schott, glass, company, walter, geffcken, invented, the, first, dielectric, mirrors, to, use, multilayer, coatings, the, greek, in, classical, antiquity, were, familiar, with, the, use, of, mirrors, to, concentrate, light, parabolic, mirrors, were, described, and, studied, by, the, mathematician, diocles, in, his, work, on, burning, mirrors, ptolemy, conducted, a, number, of, experiments, with, curved, polished, iron, mirrors, p, 64, and, discussed, plane, convex, spherical, and, concave, spherical, mirrors, in, his, optics, parabolic, mirrors, were, also, described, by, the, caliphate, mathematician, ibn, sahl, in, the, tenth, century, mirrors, can, be, classified, in, many, ways, including, by, shape, support, reflective, materials, manufacturing, methods, and, intended, application, typical, mirror, shapes, are, planar, and, curved, mirrors, the, surface, of, curved, mirrors, is, often, a, part, of, a, sphere, mirrors, that, are, meant, to, precisely, concentrate, parallel, rays, of, light, into, a, point, are, usually, made, in, the, shape, of, a, paraboloid, of, revolution, instead, they, are, used, in, telescopes, from, radio, waves, to, x, rays, in, antennas, to, communicate, with, broadcast, satellites, and, in, solar, furnaces, a, segmented, mirror, consisting, of, multiple, flat, or, curved, mirrors, properly, placed, and, oriented, may, be, used, instead, mirrors, that, are, intended, to, concentrate, sunlight, onto, a, long, pipe, may, be, a, circular, cylinder, or, of, a, parabolic, cylinder, the, most, common, structural, material, for, mirrors, is, glass, due, to, its, transparency, ease, of, fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and, ability, to, take, a, smooth, finish, the, most, common, mirrors, consist, of, a, plate, of, transparent, glass, with, a, thin, reflective, layer, on, the, back, the, side, opposite, to, the, incident, and, reflected, light, backed, by, a, coating, that, protects, that, layer, against, abrasion, tarnishing, and, corrosion, the, glass, is, usually, soda, lime, glass, but, lead, glass, may, be, used, for, decorative, effects, and, other, transparent, materials, may, be, used, for, specific, applications, a, plate, of, transparent, plastic, may, be, used, instead, of, glass, for, lighter, weight, or, impact, resistance, alternatively, a, flexible, transparent, plastic, film, may, be, bonded, to, the, front, and, or, back, surface, of, the, mirror, to, prevent, injuries, in, case, the, mirror, is, broken, lettering, or, decorative, designs, may, be, printed, on, the, front, face, of, the, glass, or, formed, on, the, reflective, layer, the, front, surface, may, have, an, anti, reflection, coating, mirrors, which, are, reflective, on, the, front, surface, the, same, side, of, the, incident, and, reflected, light, may, be, made, of, any, rigid, material, the, supporting, material, does, not, necessarily, need, to, be, transparent, but, telescope, mirrors, often, use, glass, anyway, often, a, protective, transparent, coating, is, added, on, top, of, the, reflecting, layer, to, protect, it, against, abrasion, tarnishing, and, corrosion, or, to, absorb, certain, wavelengths, thin, flexible, plastic, mirrors, are, sometimes, used, for, safety, since, they, cannot, shatter, or, produce, sharp, flakes, their, flatness, is, achieved, by, stretching, them, on, a, rigid, frame, these, usually, consist, of, a, layer, of, evaporated, aluminium, between, two, thin, layers, of, transparent, plastic, in, common, mirrors, the, reflective, layer, is, usually, some, metal, like, silver, tin, nickel, or, chromium, deposited, by, a, wet, process, or, aluminium, deposited, by, sputtering, or, evaporation, in, vacuum, the, reflective, layer, may, also, be, made, of, one, or, more, layers, of, transparent, materials, with, suitable, indices, of, refraction, the, structural, material, may, be, a, metal, in, which, case, the, reflecting, layer, may, be, just, the, surface, of, the, same, metal, concave, dishes, are, often, used, to, reflect, infrared, light, such, as, in, space, heaters, or, microwaves, as, in, satellite, tv, antennas, liquid, metal, telescopes, use, a, surface, of, liquid, metal, such, as, mercury, mirrors, that, reflect, only, part, of, the, light, while, transmitting, some, of, the, rest, can, be, made, with, very, thin, metal, layers, or, suitable, combinations, of, dielectric, layers, they, are, typically, used, as, beamsplitters, a, dichroic, mirror, in, particular, has, surface, that, reflects, certain, wavelengths, of, light, while, letting, other, wavelengths, pass, through, a, cold, mirror, is, a, dichroic, mirror, that, efficiently, reflects, the, entire, visible, light, spectrum, while, transmitting, infrared, wavelengths, a, hot, mirror, is, the, opposite, it, reflects, infrared, light, while, transmitting, visible, light, dichroic, mirrors, are, often, used, as, filters, to, remove, undesired, components, of, the, light, in, cameras, and, measuring, instruments, in, x, ray, telescopes, the, x, rays, reflect, off, a, highly, precise, metal, surface, at, almost, grazing, angles, and, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, rays, are, reflected, in, flying, relativistic, mirrors, conceived, for, x, ray, lasers, the, reflecting, surface, is, a, spherical, shockwave, wake, wave, created, in, a, low, density, plasma, by, a, very, intense, laser, pulse, and, moving, at, an, extremely, high, velocity, a, phase, conjugating, mirror, uses, nonlinear, optics, to, reverse, the, phase, difference, between, incident, beams, such, mirrors, may, be, used, for, example, for, coherent, beam, combination, the, useful, applications, are, self, guiding, of, laser, beams, and, correction, of, atmospheric, distortions, in, imaging, systems, when, a, sufficiently, narrow, beam, of, light, is, reflected, at, a, point, of, a, surface, the, surface, s, normal, direction, n, displaystyle, vec, n, will, be, the, bisector, of, the, angle, formed, by, the, two, beams, at, that, point, that, is, the, direction, vector, u, displaystyle, vec, u, towards, the, incident, beams, s, source, the, normal, vector, n, displaystyle, vec, n, and, direction, vector, v, displaystyle, vec, v, of, the, reflected, beam, will, be, coplanar, and, the, angle, between, n, displaystyle, vec, n, and, v, displaystyle, vec, v, will, be, equal, to, the, angle, of, incidence, between, n, displaystyle, vec, n, and, u, displaystyle, vec, u, but, of, opposite, sign, this, property, can, be, explained, by, the, physics, of, an, electromagnetic, plane, wave, that, is, incident, to, a, flat, surface, that, is, electrically, conductive, or, where, the, speed, of, light, changes, abruptly, as, between, two, materials, with, different, indices, of, refraction, more, specifically, a, concave, parabolic, mirror, whose, surface, is, a, part, of, a, paraboloid, of, revolution, will, reflect, rays, that, are, parallel, to, its, axis, into, rays, that, pass, through, its, focus, conversely, a, parabolic, concave, mirror, will, reflect, any, ray, that, comes, from, its, focus, towards, a, direction, parallel, to, its, axis, if, a, concave, mirror, surface, is, a, part, of, a, prolate, ellipsoid, it, will, reflect, any, ray, coming, from, one, focus, toward, the, other, focus, a, convex, parabolic, mirror, on, the, other, hand, will, reflect, rays, that, are, parallel, to, its, axis, into, rays, that, seem, to, emanate, from, the, focus, of, the, surface, behind, the, mirror, conversely, it, will, reflect, incoming, rays, that, converge, toward, that, point, into, rays, that, are, parallel, to, the, axis, a, convex, mirror, that, is, part, of, a, prolate, ellipsoid, will, reflect, rays, that, converge, towards, one, focus, into, divergent, rays, that, seem, to, emanate, from, the, other, focus, spherical, mirrors, do, not, reflect, parallel, rays, to, rays, that, converge, to, or, diverge, from, a, single, point, or, vice, versa, due, to, spherical, aberration, however, a, spherical, mirror, whose, diameter, is, sufficiently, small, compared, to, the, sphere, s, radius, will, behave, very, similarly, to, a, parabolic, mirror, whose, axis, goes, through, the, mirror, s, center, and, the, center, of, that, sphere, so, that, spherical, mirrors, can, substitute, for, parabolic, ones, in, many, applications, a, similar, aberration, occurs, with, parabolic, mirrors, when, the, incident, rays, are, parallel, among, themselves, but, not, parallel, to, the, mirror, s, axis, or, are, divergent, from, a, point, that, is, not, the, focus, as, when, trying, to, form, an, image, of, an, object, that, is, near, the, mirror, or, spans, a, wide, angle, as, seen, from, it, however, this, aberration, can, be, sufficiently, small, if, the, object, image, is, sufficiently, far, from, the, mirror, and, spans, a, sufficiently, small, angle, around, its, axis, mirrors, reflect, an, image, to, the, observer, however, unlike, a, projected, image, on, a, screen, an, image, does, not, actually, exist, on, the, surface, of, the, mirror, for, example, when, two, people, look, at, each, other, in, a, mirror, both, see, different, images, on, the, same, surface, when, the, light, waves, converge, through, the, lens, of, the, eye, they, interfere, with, each, other, to, form, the, image, on, the, surface, of, the, retina, and, since, both, viewers, see, waves, coming, from, different, directions, each, sees, a, different, image, in, the, same, mirror, thus, the, images, observed, in, a, mirror, depend, upon, the, angle, of, the, mirror, with, respect, to, the, eye, the, angle, between, the, object, and, the, observer, is, always, twice, the, angle, between, the, eye, and, the, normal, or, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, surface, this, allows, animals, with, binocular, vision, to, see, the, reflected, image, with, depth, perception, and, in, three, dimensions, the, mirror, forms, a, virtual, image, of, whatever, is, in, the, opposite, angle, from, the, viewer, meaning, that, objects, in, the, image, appear, to, exist, in, a, direct, line, of, sight, behind, the, surface, of, the, mirror, at, an, equal, distance, from, their, position, in, front, of, the, mirror, objects, behind, the, observer, or, between, the, observer, and, the, mirror, are, reflected, back, to, the, observer, without, any, actual, change, in, orientation, the, light, waves, are, simply, reversed, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, the, mirror, however, when, viewer, is, facing, the, object, and, the, mirror, is, at, an, angle, between, them, the, image, appears, inverted, 180, along, the, direction, of, the, angle, objects, viewed, in, a, plane, mirror, will, appear, laterally, inverted, e, g, if, one, raises, one, s, right, hand, the, image, s, left, hand, will, appear, to, go, up, in, the, mirror, but, not, vertically, inverted, in, the, image, a, person, s, head, still, appears, above, their, body, however, a, mirror, does, not, actually, swap, left, and, right, any, more, than, it, swaps, top, and, bottom, a, mirror, swaps, front, and, back, to, be, precise, it, reverses, the, object, in, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, mirror, surface, the, normal, turning, the, three, dimensional, image, inside, out, the, way, a, glove, stripped, off, the, hand, can, be, turned, inside, out, turning, a, left, hand, glove, into, a, right, hand, glove, or, vice, versa, when, a, person, raises, their, left, hand, the, actual, left, hand, raises, in, the, mirror, but, gives, the, illusion, of, a, right, hand, raising, because, the, imaginary, person, in, the, mirror, is, literally, inside, out, hand, and, all, if, the, person, stands, side, on, to, a, mirror, the, mirror, really, does, reverse, left, and, right, hands, that, is, objects, that, are, physically, closer, to, the, mirror, always, appear, closer, in, the, virtual, image, and, objects, farther, from, the, surface, always, appear, symmetrically, farther, away, regardless, of, angle, looking, at, an, image, of, oneself, with, the, front, back, axis, flipped, results, in, the, perception, of, an, image, with, its, left, right, axis, flipped, when, reflected, in, the, mirror, a, person, s, right, hand, remains, directly, opposite, their, real, right, hand, but, it, is, perceived, by, the, mind, as, the, left, hand, in, the, image, when, a, person, looks, into, a, mirror, the, image, is, actually, front, back, reversed, inside, out, which, is, an, effect, similar, to, the, hollow, mask, illusion, notice, that, a, mirror, image, is, fundamentally, different, from, the, object, inside, out, and, cannot, be, reproduced, by, simply, rotating, the, object, an, object, and, its, mirror, image, are, said, to, be, chiral, for, things, that, may, be, considered, as, two, dimensional, objects, like, text, front, back, reversal, cannot, usually, explain, the, observed, reversal, an, image, is, a, two, dimensional, representation, of, a, three, dimensional, space, and, because, it, exists, in, a, two, dimensional, plane, an, image, can, be, viewed, from, front, or, back, in, the, same, way, that, text, on, a, piece, of, paper, appears, reversed, if, held, up, to, a, light, and, viewed, from, behind, text, held, facing, a, mirror, will, appear, reversed, because, the, image, of, the, text, is, still, facing, away, from, the, observer, another, way, to, understand, the, reversals, observed, in, images, of, objects, that, are, effectively, two, dimensional, is, that, the, inversion, of, left, and, right, in, a, mirror, is, due, to, the, way, human, beings, perceive, their, surroundings, a, person, s, reflection, in, a, mirror, appears, to, be, a, real, person, facing, them, but, for, that, person, to, really, face, themselves, i, e, twins, one, would, have, to, physically, turn, and, face, the, other, causing, an, actual, swapping, of, right, and, left, a, mirror, causes, an, illusion, of, left, right, reversal, because, left, and, right, were, not, swapped, when, the, image, appears, to, have, turned, around, to, face, the, viewer, the, viewer, s, egocentric, navigation, left, and, right, with, respect, to, the, observer, s, point, of, view, i, e, my, left, is, unconsciously, replaced, with, their, allocentric, navigation, left, and, right, as, it, relates, another, s, point, of, view, your, right, when, processing, the, virtual, image, of, the, apparent, person, behind, the, mirror, likewise, text, viewed, in, a, mirror, would, have, to, be, physically, turned, around, facing, the, observer, and, away, from, the, surface, actually, swapping, left, and, right, to, be, read, in, the, mirror, the, reflectivity, of, a, mirror, is, determined, by, the, percentage, of, reflected, light, per, the, total, of, the, incident, light, the, reflectivity, may, vary, with, wavelength, all, or, a, portion, of, the, light, not, reflected, is, absorbed, by, the, mirror, while, in, some, cases, a, portion, may, also, transmit, through, although, some, small, portion, of, the, light, will, be, absorbed, by, the, coating, the, reflectivity, is, usually, higher, for, first, surface, mirrors, eliminating, both, reflection, and, absorption, losses, from, the, substrate, the, reflectivity, is, often, determined, by, the, type, and, thickness, of, the, coating, when, the, thickness, of, the, coating, is, sufficient, to, prevent, transmission, all, of, the, losses, occur, due, to, absorption, aluminium, is, harder, and, more, resistant, to, tarnishing, than, silver, and, will, reflect, 85, to, 90, of, the, light, in, the, visible, to, near, ultraviolet, range, but, experiences, a, drop, in, its, reflectance, between, 800, and, 900, nm, gold, is, very, soft, and, easily, scratched, but, does, not, tarnish, gold, is, greater, than, 96, reflective, to, near, and, far, infrared, light, between, 800, and, 12000, nm, but, poorly, reflects, visible, light, with, wavelengths, shorter, than, 600, nm, yellow, silver, is, expensive, soft, and, quickly, tarnishes, but, has, the, highest, reflectivity, in, the, visual, to, near, infrared, of, any, metal, silver, can, reflect, up, to, 98, or, 99, of, light, to, wavelengths, as, long, as, 2000, nm, but, loses, nearly, all, reflectivity, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 350, nm, dielectric, mirrors, can, reflect, greater, than, 99, 99, of, light, but, only, for, a, narrow, range, of, wavelengths, ranging, from, a, bandwidth, of, only, 10, nm, to, as, wide, as, 100, nm, for, tunable, lasers, however, dielectric, coatings, can, also, enhance, the, reflectivity, of, metallic, coatings, and, protect, them, from, scratching, or, tarnishing, dielectric, materials, are, typically, very, hard, and, relatively, cheap, however, the, number, of, coats, needed, generally, makes, it, an, expensive, process, in, mirrors, with, low, tolerances, the, coating, thickness, may, be, reduced, to, save, cost, and, simply, covered, with, paint, to, absorb, transmission, surface, quality, or, surface, accuracy, measures, the, deviations, from, a, perfect, ideal, surface, shape, increasing, the, surface, quality, reduces, distortion, artifacts, and, aberration, in, images, and, helps, increase, coherence, collimation, and, reduce, unwanted, divergence, in, beams, for, plane, mirrors, this, is, often, described, in, terms, of, flatness, while, other, surface, shapes, are, compared, to, an, ideal, shape, the, surface, quality, is, typically, measured, with, items, like, interferometers, or, optical, flats, and, are, usually, measured, in, wavelengths, of, light, these, deviations, can, be, much, larger, or, much, smaller, than, the, surface, roughness, a, normal, household, mirror, made, with, float, glass, may, have, flatness, tolerances, as, low, as, 9, 14, per, inch, 25, 4, mm, equating, to, a, deviation, of, 5600, through, 8800, nanometers, from, perfect, flatness, precision, ground, and, polished, mirrors, intended, for, lasers, or, telescopes, may, have, tolerances, as, high, as, 50, 1, 50, of, the, wavelength, of, the, light, or, around, 12, nm, across, the, entire, surface, the, surface, quality, can, be, affected, by, factors, such, as, temperature, changes, internal, stress, in, the, substrate, or, even, bending, effects, that, occur, when, combining, materials, with, different, coefficients, of, thermal, expansion, similar, to, a, bimetallic, strip, surface, roughness, describes, the, texture, of, the, surface, often, in, terms, of, the, depth, of, the, microscopic, scratches, left, by, the, polishing, operations, surface, roughness, determines, how, much, of, the, reflection, is, specular, and, how, much, diffuses, controlling, how, clear, or, cloudy, the, image, will, be, for, perfectly, specular, reflection, the, surface, roughness, must, be, kept, smaller, than, the, wavelength, of, the, light, microwaves, which, sometimes, have, a, wavelength, greater, than, an, inch, 25, mm, can, reflect, specularly, off, a, metal, screen, door, continental, ice, sheets, or, desert, sand, while, visible, light, having, wavelengths, of, only, a, few, hundred, nanometers, a, few, hundred, thousandths, of, an, inch, must, meet, a, very, smooth, surface, to, produce, specular, reflection, for, wavelengths, that, are, approaching, or, are, even, shorter, than, the, diameter, of, the, atoms, such, as, x, rays, specular, reflection, can, only, be, produced, by, surfaces, that, are, at, a, grazing, incidence, from, the, rays, surface, roughness, is, typically, measured, in, microns, wavelength, or, grit, size, with, 80, 000, 100, 000, grit, or, being, optical, quality, transmissivity, is, determined, by, the, percentage, of, light, transmitted, per, the, incident, light, transmissivity, is, usually, the, same, from, both, first, and, second, surfaces, the, combined, transmitted, and, reflected, light, subtracted, from, the, incident, light, measures, the, amount, absorbed, by, both, the, coating, and, substrate, for, transmissive, mirrors, such, as, one, way, mirrors, beam, splitters, or, laser, output, couplers, the, transmissivity, of, the, mirror, is, an, important, consideration, the, transmissivity, of, metallic, coatings, are, often, determined, by, their, thickness, for, precision, beam, splitters, or, output, couplers, the, thickness, of, the, coating, must, be, kept, at, very, high, tolerances, to, transmit, the, proper, amount, of, light, for, dielectric, mirrors, the, thickness, of, the, coat, must, always, be, kept, to, high, tolerances, but, it, is, often, more, the, number, of, individual, coats, that, determine, the, transmissivity, for, the, substrate, the, material, used, must, also, have, good, transmissivity, to, the, chosen, wavelengths, glass, is, a, suitable, substrate, for, most, visible, light, applications, but, other, substrates, such, as, zinc, selenide, or, synthetic, sapphire, may, be, used, for, infrared, or, ultraviolet, wavelengths, p, 104, 108, wedge, errors, are, caused, by, the, deviation, of, the, surfaces, from, perfect, parallelism, an, optical, wedge, is, the, angle, formed, between, two, plane, surfaces, or, between, the, principle, planes, of, curved, surfaces, due, to, manufacturing, errors, or, limitations, causing, one, edge, of, the, mirror, to, be, slightly, thicker, than, the, other, nearly, all, mirrors, and, optics, with, parallel, faces, have, some, slight, degree, of, wedge, which, is, usually, measured, in, seconds, or, minutes, of, arc, for, first, surface, mirrors, wedges, can, introduce, alignment, deviations, in, mounting, hardware, for, second, surface, or, transmissive, mirrors, wedges, can, have, a, prismatic, effect, on, the, light, deviating, its, trajectory, or, to, a, very, slight, degree, its, color, causing, chromatic, and, other, forms, of, aberration, in, some, instances, a, slight, wedge, is, desirable, such, as, in, certain, laser, systems, where, stray, reflections, from, the, uncoated, surface, are, better, dispersed, than, reflected, back, through, the, medium, surface, defects, are, small, scale, discontinuous, imperfections, in, the, surface, smoothness, surface, defects, are, larger, in, some, cases, much, larger, than, the, surface, roughness, but, only, affect, small, localized, portions, of, the, entire, surface, these, are, typically, found, as, scratches, digs, pits, often, from, bubbles, in, the, glass, sleeks, scratches, from, prior, larger, grit, polishing, operations, that, were, not, fully, removed, by, subsequent, polishing, grits, edge, chips, or, blemishes, in, the, coating, these, defects, are, often, an, unavoidable, side, effect, of, manufacturing, limitations, both, in, cost, and, machine, precision, if, kept, low, enough, in, most, applications, these, defects, will, rarely, have, any, adverse, effect, unless, the, surface, is, located, at, an, image, plane, where, they, will, show, up, directly, for, applications, that, require, extremely, low, scattering, of, light, extremely, high, reflectance, or, low, absorption, due, to, high, energy, levels, that, could, destroy, the, mirror, such, as, lasers, or, fabry, perot, interferometers, the, surface, defects, must, be, kept, to, a, minimum, mirrors, are, usually, manufactured, by, either, polishing, a, naturally, reflective, material, such, as, speculum, metal, or, by, applying, a, reflective, coating, to, a, suitable, polished, substrate, in, some, applications, generally, those, that, are, cost, sensitive, or, that, require, great, durability, such, as, for, mounting, in, a, prison, cell, mirrors, may, be, made, from, a, single, bulk, material, such, as, polished, metal, however, metals, consist, of, small, crystals, grains, separated, by, grain, boundaries, that, may, prevent, the, surface, from, attaining, optical, smoothness, and, uniform, reflectivity, p, 2, 8, the, coating, of, glass, with, a, reflective, layer, of, a, metal, is, generally, called, silvering, even, though, the, metal, may, not, be, silver, currently, the, main, processes, are, electroplating, wet, chemical, deposition, and, vacuum, deposition, front, coated, metal, mirrors, achieve, reflectivities, of, 90, 95, when, new, applications, requiring, higher, reflectivity, or, greater, durability, where, wide, bandwidth, is, not, essential, use, dielectric, coatings, which, can, achieve, reflectivities, as, high, as, 99, 997, over, a, limited, range, of, wavelengths, because, they, are, often, chemically, stable, and, do, not, conduct, electricity, dielectric, coatings, are, almost, always, applied, by, methods, of, vacuum, deposition, and, most, commonly, by, evaporation, deposition, because, the, coatings, are, usually, transparent, absorption, losses, are, negligible, unlike, with, metals, the, reflectivity, of, the, individual, dielectric, coatings, is, a, function, of, snell, s, law, known, as, the, fresnel, equations, determined, by, the, difference, in, refractive, index, between, layers, therefore, the, thickness, and, index, of, the, coatings, can, be, adjusted, to, be, centered, on, any, wavelength, vacuum, deposition, can, be, achieved, in, a, number, of, ways, including, sputtering, evaporation, deposition, arc, deposition, reactive, gas, deposition, and, ion, plating, among, many, others, p, 103, 107, mirrors, can, be, manufactured, to, a, wide, range, of, engineering, tolerances, including, reflectivity, surface, quality, surface, roughness, or, transmissivity, depending, on, the, desired, application, these, tolerances, can, range, from, wide, such, as, found, in, a, normal, household, mirror, to, extremely, narrow, like, those, used, in, lasers, or, telescopes, tightening, the, tolerances, allows, better, and, more, precise, imaging, or, beam, transmission, over, longer, distances, in, imaging, systems, this, can, help, reduce, anomalies, artifacts, distortion, or, blur, but, at, a, much, higher, cost, where, viewing, distances, are, relatively, close, or, high, precision, is, not, a, concern, wider, tolerances, can, be, used, to, make, effective, mirrors, at, affordable, costs, mirrors, are, commonly, used, as, aids, to, personal, grooming, they, may, range, from, small, sizes, portable, to, full, body, sized, they, may, be, handheld, mobile, fixed, or, adjustable, a, classic, example, of, an, adjustable, mirror, is, the, cheval, glass, which, the, user, can, tilt, convex, mirrors, provide, a, wider, field, of, view, than, flat, mirrors, and, are, often, used, on, vehicles, especially, large, trucks, to, minimize, blind, spots, they, are, sometimes, placed, at, road, junctions, and, at, corners, of, sites, such, as, parking, lots, to, allow, people, to, see, around, corners, to, avoid, crashing, into, other, vehicles, or, shopping, carts, they, are, also, sometimes, used, as, part, of, security, systems, so, that, a, single, video, camera, can, show, more, than, one, angle, at, a, time, convex, mirrors, as, decoration, are, used, in, interior, design, to, provide, a, predominantly, experiential, effect, with, the, sun, as, light, source, a, mirror, can, be, used, to, signal, by, variations, in, the, orientation, of, the, mirror, the, signal, can, be, used, over, long, distances, possibly, up, to, 60, kilometres, 37, mi, on, a, clear, day, native, american, tribes, and, numerous, militaries, used, this, technique, to, transmit, information, between, distant, outposts, mirrors, can, also, be, used, to, attract, the, attention, of, search, and, rescue, parties, specialized, types, of, mirrors, are, available, and, are, often, included, in, military, survival, kits, microscopic, mirrors, are, a, core, element, of, many, of, the, largest, high, definition, televisions, and, video, projectors, a, common, technology, of, this, type, is, texas, instruments, dlp, a, dlp, chip, is, a, postage, stamp, sized, microchip, whose, surface, is, an, array, of, millions, of, microscopic, mirrors, the, picture, is, created, as, the, individual, mirrors, move, to, either, reflect, light, toward, the, projection, surface, pixel, on, or, toward, a, light, absorbing, surface, pixel, off, other, projection, technologies, involving, mirrors, include, lcos, like, a, dlp, chip, lcos, is, a, microchip, of, similar, size, but, rather, than, millions, of, individual, mirrors, there, is, a, single, mirror, that, is, actively, shielded, by, a, liquid, crystal, matrix, with, up, to, millions, of, pixels, the, picture, formed, as, light, is, either, reflected, toward, the, projection, surface, pixel, on, or, absorbed, by, the, activated, lcd, pixels, pixel, off, lcos, based, televisions, and, projectors, often, use, 3, chips, one, for, each, primary, color, large, mirrors, are, used, in, rear, projection, televisions, light, for, example, from, a, dlp, as, discussed, above, is, folded, by, one, or, more, mirrors, so, that, the, television, set, is, compact, optical, discs, are, modified, mirrors, which, encode, binary, data, as, a, series, of, physical, pits, and, lands, on, an, inner, layer, between, the, metal, backing, and, outer, plastic, surface, the, data, is, read, and, decoded, by, observing, distortions, in, a, reflected, laser, beam, caused, by, the, physical, variations, in, the, inner, layer, optical, discs, typically, use, aluminum, backing, like, conventional, mirrors, though, ones, with, silver, and, gold, backings, also, exist, mirrors, are, integral, parts, of, a, solar, power, plant, the, one, shown, in, the, adjacent, picture, uses, concentrated, solar, power, from, an, array, of, parabolic, troughs, telescopes, and, other, precision, instruments, use, front, silvered, or, first, surface, mirrors, where, the, reflecting, surface, is, placed, on, the, front, or, first, surface, of, the, glass, this, eliminates, reflection, from, glass, surface, ordinary, back, mirrors, have, some, of, them, use, silver, but, most, are, aluminium, which, is, more, reflective, at, short, wavelengths, than, silver, all, of, these, coatings, are, easily, damaged, and, require, special, handling, they, reflect, 90, to, 95, of, the, incident, light, when, new, the, coatings, are, typically, applied, by, vacuum, deposition, a, protective, overcoat, is, usually, applied, before, the, mirror, is, removed, from, the, vacuum, because, the, coating, otherwise, begins, to, corrode, as, soon, as, it, is, exposed, to, oxygen, and, humidity, in, air, front, silvered, mirrors, have, to, be, resurfaced, occasionally, to, maintain, their, quality, there, are, optical, mirrors, such, as, mangin, mirrors, that, are, second, surface, mirrors, reflective, coating, on, the, rear, surface, as, part, of, their, optical, designs, usually, to, correct, optical, aberrations, the, reflectivity, of, the, mirror, coating, can, be, measured, using, a, reflectometer, and, for, a, particular, metal, it, will, be, different, for, different, wavelengths, of, light, this, is, exploited, in, some, optical, work, to, make, cold, mirrors, and, hot, mirrors, a, cold, mirror, is, made, by, using, a, transparent, substrate, and, choosing, a, coating, material, that, is, more, reflective, to, visible, light, and, more, transmissive, to, infrared, light, a, hot, mirror, is, the, opposite, the, coating, preferentially, reflects, infrared, mirror, surfaces, are, sometimes, given, thin, film, overcoatings, both, to, retard, degradation, of, the, surface, and, to, increase, their, reflectivity, in, parts, of, the, spectrum, where, they, will, be, used, for, instance, aluminium, mirrors, are, commonly, coated, with, silicon, dioxide, or, magnesium, fluoride, the, reflectivity, as, a, function, of, wavelength, depends, on, both, the, thickness, of, the, coating, and, on, how, it, is, applied, for, scientific, optical, work, dielectric, mirrors, are, often, used, these, are, glass, or, sometimes, other, material, substrates, on, which, one, or, more, layers, of, dielectric, material, are, deposited, to, form, an, optical, coating, by, careful, choice, of, the, type, and, thickness, of, the, dielectric, layers, the, range, of, wavelengths, and, amount, of, light, reflected, from, the, mirror, can, be, specified, the, best, mirrors, of, this, type, can, reflect, 99, 999, of, the, light, in, a, narrow, range, of, wavelengths, which, is, incident, on, the, mirror, such, mirrors, are, often, used, in, lasers, in, astronomy, adaptive, optics, is, a, technique, to, measure, variable, image, distortions, and, adapt, a, deformable, mirror, accordingly, on, a, timescale, of, milliseconds, to, compensate, for, the, distortions, although, most, mirrors, are, designed, to, reflect, visible, light, surfaces, reflecting, other, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, are, also, called, mirrors, the, mirrors, for, other, ranges, of, electromagnetic, waves, are, used, in, optics, and, astronomy, mirrors, for, radio, waves, sometimes, known, as, reflectors, are, important, elements, of, radio, telescopes, simple, periscopes, use, mirrors, two, or, more, mirrors, aligned, exactly, parallel, and, facing, each, other, can, give, an, infinite, regress, of, reflections, called, an, infinity, mirror, effect, some, devices, use, this, to, generate, multiple, reflections, tradition, states, that, archimedes, used, a, large, array, of, mirrors, to, burn, roman, ships, during, an, attack, on, syracuse, this, has, never, been, proven, or, disproved, on, the, tv, show, mythbusters, a, team, from, mit, tried, to, recreate, the, famous, archimedes, death, ray, they, were, unsuccessful, at, starting, a, fire, on, a, ship, previous, attempts, to, set, a, boat, on, fire, using, only, the, bronze, mirrors, available, in, archimedes, time, were, unsuccessful, and, the, time, taken, to, ignite, the, craft, would, have, made, its, use, impractical, resulting, in, the, mythbusters, team, deeming, the, myth, busted, it, was, however, found, that, the, mirrors, made, it, very, difficult, for, the, passengers, of, the, targeted, boat, to, see, such, a, scenario, could, have, impeded, attackers, and, have, provided, the, origin, of, the, legend, see, solar, power, tower, for, a, practical, use, of, this, technique, periscopes, were, used, to, great, effect, in, war, especially, during, the, world, wars, where, they, were, used, to, peer, over, the, parapet, of, trenches, to, ensure, that, the, soldier, using, the, periscope, could, see, safely, without, the, risk, of, incoming, direct, fire, from, other, small, arms, due, to, its, location, in, a, steep, sided, valley, the, italian, town, of, viganella, gets, no, direct, sunlight, for, seven, weeks, each, winter, in, 2006, a, 100, 000, computer, controlled, mirror, 8, 5, m, was, installed, to, reflect, sunlight, into, the, town, s, piazza, in, early, 2007, the, similarly, situated, village, of, bondo, switzerland, was, considering, applying, this, solution, as, well, in, 2013, mirrors, were, installed, to, reflect, sunlight, into, the, town, square, in, the, norwegian, town, of, rjukan, mirrors, can, be, used, to, produce, enhanced, lighting, effects, in, greenhouses, or, conservatories, mirrors, are, a, popular, design, theme, in, architecture, particularly, with, late, modern, and, post, modernist, high, rise, buildings, in, major, cities, early, examples, include, the, campbell, center, in, dallas, which, opened, in, 1972, and, the, john, hancock, tower, completed, in, 1976, in, boston, more, recently, two, skyscrapers, designed, by, architect, rafael, vi, oly, the, vdara, in, las, vegas, and, 20, fenchurch, street, in, london, have, experienced, unusual, problems, due, to, their, concave, curved, glass, exteriors, acting, as, respectively, cylindrical, and, spherical, reflectors, for, sunlight, in, 2010, the, las, vegas, review, journal, reported, that, sunlight, reflected, off, the, vdara, s, south, facing, tower, could, singe, swimmers, in, the, hotel, pool, as, well, as, melting, plastic, cups, and, shopping, bags, employees, of, the, hotel, referred, to, the, phenomenon, as, the, vdara, death, ray, aka, the, fryscraper, in, 2013, sunlight, reflecting, off, 20, fenchurch, street, melted, parts, of, a, jaguar, car, parked, nearby, and, scorching, or, igniting, the, carpet, of, a, nearby, barber, shop, this, building, had, been, nicknamed, the, walkie, talkie, because, its, shape, was, supposedly, similar, to, a, certain, model, of, two, way, radio, but, after, its, tendency, to, overheat, surrounding, objects, became, known, the, nickname, changed, to, the, walkie, scorchie, painters, depicting, someone, gazing, into, a, mirror, often, also, show, the, person, s, reflection, this, is, a, kind, of, abstraction, in, most, cases, the, angle, of, view, is, such, that, the, person, s, reflection, should, not, be, visible, similarly, in, movies, and, still, photography, an, actor, or, actress, is, often, shown, ostensibly, looking, at, him, or, herself, in, a, mirror, and, yet, the, reflection, faces, the, camera, in, reality, the, actor, or, actress, sees, only, the, camera, and, its, operator, in, this, case, not, their, own, reflection, in, the, psychology, of, perception, this, is, known, as, the, venus, effect, the, mirror, is, the, central, device, in, some, of, the, greatest, of, european, paintings, artists, have, used, mirrors, to, create, works, and, to, hone, their, craft, mirrors, are, sometimes, necessary, to, fully, appreciate, art, work, contemporary, anamorphic, artist, jonty, hurwitz, uses, cylindrical, mirrors, to, project, distorted, sculptures, some, other, contemporary, artists, use, mirrors, as, the, material, of, art, in, the, middle, ages, mirrors, existed, in, various, shapes, for, multiple, uses, mostly, they, were, used, as, an, accessory, for, personal, hygiene, but, also, as, tokens, of, courtly, love, made, from, ivory, in, the, ivory, carving, centers, in, paris, cologne, and, the, southern, netherlands, they, also, had, their, uses, in, religious, contexts, as, they, were, integrated, in, a, special, form, of, pilgrims, badges, or, pewter, lead, mirror, boxes, from, the, late, 14th, century, burgundian, ducal, inventories, show, us, that, the, dukes, owned, a, mass, of, mirrors, or, objects, with, mirrors, not, only, with, religious, iconography, or, inscriptions, but, combined, with, reliquaries, religious, paintings, or, other, objects, that, were, distinctively, used, for, personal, piety, considering, mirrors, in, paintings, and, book, illumination, as, depicted, artifacts, and, trying, to, draw, conclusions, about, their, functions, from, their, depicted, setting, one, of, these, functions, is, to, be, an, aid, in, personal, prayer, to, achieve, self, knowledge, and, knowledge, of, god, in, accord, with, contemporary, theological, sources, for, example, the, famous, arnolfini, wedding, by, jan, van, eyck, shows, a, constellation, of, objects, that, can, be, recognized, as, one, which, would, allow, a, praying, man, to, use, them, for, his, personal, piety, the, mirror, surrounded, by, scenes, of, the, passion, to, reflect, on, it, and, on, oneself, a, rosary, as, a, device, in, this, process, the, veiled, and, cushioned, bench, to, use, as, a, prie, dieu, and, the, abandoned, shoes, that, point, in, the, direction, in, which, the, praying, man, kneeled, the, metaphorical, meaning, of, depicted, mirrors, is, complex, and, many, layered, e, g, as, an, attribute, of, mary, the, speculum, sine, macula, mirror, without, blemish, or, as, attributes, of, scholarly, and, theological, wisdom, and, knowledge, as, they, appear, in, book, illuminations, of, different, evangelists, and, authors, of, theological, treatises, depicted, mirrors, orientated, on, the, physical, properties, of, a, real, mirror, can, be, seen, as, metaphors, of, knowledge, and, reflection, and, are, thus, able, to,
