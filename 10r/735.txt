a, tanker, or, tank, ship, or, tankship, is, a, ship, designed, to, transport, or, store, liquids, or, gases, in, bulk, major, types, of, tankship, include, the, oil, tanker, or, petroleum, tanker, the, chemical, tanker, cargo, ships, and, a, gas, carrier, tankers, also, carry, commodities, such, as, vegetable, oils, molasses, and, wine, in, the, united, states, navy, and, military, sealift, command, a, tanker, used, to, refuel, other, ships, is, called, an, oiler, or, replenishment, oiler, if, it, can, also, supply, dry, stores, but, many, other, navies, use, the, terms, tanker, and, replenishment, tanker, tankers, were, first, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, iron, and, steel, hulls, and, pumping, systems, were, developed, as, of, 2005, there, were, just, over, 4, 000, tankers, and, supertankers, 10, 000, lt, dwt, or, greater, operating, worldwide, tankers, can, range, in, size, of, capacity, from, several, hundred, tons, which, includes, vessels, for, servicing, small, harbours, and, coastal, settlements, to, several, hundred, thousand, tons, for, long, range, haulage, besides, ocean, or, seagoing, tankers, there, are, also, specialized, inland, waterway, tankers, which, operate, on, rivers, and, canals, with, an, average, cargo, capacity, up, to, some, thousand, tons, a, wide, range, of, products, are, carried, by, tankers, including, tankers, are, a, relatively, new, concept, dating, from, the, later, years, of, the, 19th, century, before, this, technology, had, simply, not, supported, the, idea, of, carrying, bulk, liquids, the, market, was, also, not, geared, towards, transporting, or, selling, cargo, in, bulk, therefore, most, ships, carried, a, wide, range, of, different, products, in, different, holds, and, traded, outside, fixed, routes, liquids, were, usually, loaded, in, casks, hence, the, term, tonnage, which, refers, to, the, volume, of, the, holds, in, terms, of, how, many, tuns, or, casks, of, wine, could, be, carried, even, potable, water, vital, for, the, survival, of, the, crew, was, stowed, in, casks, carrying, bulk, liquids, in, earlier, ships, posed, several, problems, tankers, were, first, used, by, the, oil, industry, to, transfer, refined, fuel, in, bulk, from, refineries, to, customers, this, would, then, be, stored, in, large, tanks, ashore, and, subdivided, for, delivery, to, individual, locations, the, use, of, tankers, caught, on, because, other, liquids, were, also, cheaper, to, transport, in, bulk, store, in, dedicated, terminals, then, subdivide, even, the, guinness, brewery, used, tankers, to, transport, the, stout, across, the, irish, sea, different, products, require, different, handling, and, transport, with, specialised, variants, such, as, chemical, tankers, oil, tankers, and, lng, carriers, developed, to, handle, dangerous, chemicals, oil, and, oil, derived, products, and, liquefied, natural, gas, respectively, these, broad, variants, may, be, further, differentiated, with, respect, to, ability, to, carry, only, a, single, product, or, simultaneously, transport, mixed, cargoes, such, as, several, different, chemicals, or, refined, petroleum, products, among, oil, tankers, supertankers, are, designed, for, transporting, oil, around, the, horn, of, africa, from, the, middle, east, the, supertanker, seawise, giant, scrapped, in, 2010, was, 458, meters, 1, 503, ft, in, length, and, 69, meters, 226, ft, wide, supertankers, are, one, of, the, three, preferred, methods, for, transporting, large, quantities, of, oil, along, with, pipeline, transport, and, rail, tighter, regulation, means, that, tankers, now, cause, fewer, environmental, disasters, resulting, from, oil, spills, than, in, the, 1970s, amoco, cadiz, braer, erika, exxon, valdez, prestige, and, torrey, canyon, were, examples, of, accidents, oil, spills, from, tankers, amounted, to, around, 1, 000, tonnes, in, 2020, from, three, incidents, an, all, time, low, down, from, 636, 000, tonnes, from, 92, incidents, in, 1979, a, fall, of, 99, 8, many, modern, tankers, are, designed, for, a, specific, cargo, and, a, specific, route, draft, is, typically, limited, by, the, depth, of, water, in, loading, and, unloading, harbors, and, may, be, limited, by, the, depth, of, straits, or, canals, along, the, preferred, shipping, route, cargoes, with, high, vapor, pressure, at, ambient, temperatures, may, require, pressurized, tanks, or, vapor, recovery, systems, tank, heaters, may, be, required, to, maintain, heavy, crude, oil, residual, fuel, asphalt, wax, or, molasses, in, a, fluid, state, for, offloading, tankers, used, for, liquid, fuels, are, classified, according, to, their, capacity, in, 1954, shell, oil, developed, the, average, freight, rate, assessment, afra, system, which, classifies, tankers, of, different, sizes, to, make, it, an, independent, instrument, shell, consulted, the, london, tanker, brokers, panel, ltbp, at, first, they, divided, the, groups, as, general, purpose, for, tankers, under, 25, 000, tons, deadweight, dwt, medium, range, for, ships, between, 25, 000, and, 45, 000, dwt, and, large, range, later, long, range, for, the, then, enormous, ships, that, were, larger, than, 45, 000, dwt, the, ships, became, larger, during, the, 1970s, and, the, list, was, extended, where, the, tons, are, metric, tonnes, at, nearly, 380, vessels, in, the, size, range, 279, 000, t, dwt, to, 320, 000, t, dwt, these, are, by, far, the, most, popular, size, range, among, the, larger, vlccs, only, seven, vessels, are, larger, than, this, and, approximately, 90, between, 220, 000, t, dwt, and, 279, 000, t, dwt, as, of, 2005, the, united, states, maritime, administration, s, statistics, count, 4, 024, tankers, of, 10, 000, lt, dwt, or, greater, worldwide, 2, 582, of, these, are, double, hulled, panama, is, the, leading, flag, state, of, tankers, with, 592, registered, ships, five, other, flag, states, have, more, than, two, hundred, registered, tankers, liberia, 520, the, marshall, islands, 323, greece, 233, singapore, 274, and, the, bahamas, 215, these, flag, states, are, also, the, top, six, in, terms, of, fleet, size, in, terms, of, deadweight, tonnage, greece, japan, and, the, united, states, are, the, top, three, owners, of, tankers, including, those, owned, but, registered, to, other, nations, with, 733, 394, and, 311, vessels, respectively, these, three, nations, account, for, 1, 438, vessels, or, over, 36, of, the, world, s, fleet, asian, companies, dominate, the, construction, of, tankers, of, the, world, s, 4, 024, tankers, 2, 822, over, 70, were, built, in, south, korea, japan, and, china, petroleum, tables, a, book, by, william, davies, an, early, tanker, captain, was, published, in, 1903, although, davies, had, printed, earlier, versions, himself, including, his, calculations, on, the, expansion, and, contraction, of, bulk, oil, and, other, information, for, tanker, officers, it, went, into, multiple, editions, and, in, 1915, the, petroleum, world, commented, that, it, was, the, standard, book, for, computations, and, conversions
