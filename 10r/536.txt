https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun
a, handgun, is, a, firearm, designed, to, be, usable, with, only, one, hand, it, is, distinguished, from, a, long, barreled, gun, i, e, carbine, rifle, shotgun, submachine, gun, or, machine, gun, which, needs, to, be, held, by, both, hands, and, braced, against, the, shoulder, handguns, have, shorter, effective, ranges, compared, to, long, guns, and, are, much, harder, to, shoot, accurately, while, most, early, handguns, are, single, shot, pistols, the, two, most, common, types, of, handguns, used, in, modern, times, are, revolvers, and, semi, automatic, pistols, although, other, handguns, such, as, derringers, and, machine, pistols, also, see, infrequent, usage, before, commercial, mass, production, handguns, were, often, considered, a, badge, of, office, comparable, to, a, ceremonial, sword, as, they, had, limited, utility, and, were, more, expensive, than, the, long, barreled, guns, of, the, era, in, 1836, samuel, colt, patented, the, colt, paterson, the, first, practical, mass, produced, revolver, which, was, capable, of, firing, five, shots, in, rapid, succession, and, quickly, became, a, popular, personal, weapon, giving, rise, to, the, saying, god, created, men, but, colt, made, them, equal, today, in, most, of, the, world, handguns, are, primarily, used, by, police, and, military, officers, as, sidearms, however, in, the, united, states, and, some, other, countries, that, allow, gun, ownership, handguns, are, also, available, to, civilians, as, self, defense, weapons, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, defines, a, handgun, as, any, firearm, small, enough, to, be, held, in, one, hand, when, fired, while, the, american, webster, s, dictionary, defines, it, as, a, firearm, such, as, a, revolver, or, pistol, designed, to, be, held, and, fired, with, one, hand, among, the, anglophone, countries, neither, the, bureau, of, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and, explosives, atf, which, is, part, of, the, united, states, department, of, justice, or, the, government, of, the, united, kingdom, who, are, in, charge, of, american, and, british, firearms, licensing, respectively, offer, any, specific, legal, definitions, of, a, handgun, the, atf, however, does, separately, define, handgun, pistol, and, handgun, revolver, under, its, terminology, nomenclature, section, both, with, the, pistol, type, description, of, a, weapon, originally, designed, made, and, intended, to, fire, a, projectile, bullet, from, one, or, more, barrels, when, held, in, one, hand, the, canadian, criminal, code, defines, a, handgun, as, a, firearm, that, is, designed, altered, or, intended, to, be, aimed, and, fired, by, the, action, of, one, hand, whether, or, not, it, has, been, redesigned, or, subsequently, altered, to, be, aimed, and, fired, by, the, action, of, both, hands, the, australian, gun, laws, which, are, based, on, the, national, firearms, agreement, 1996, and, interpreted, and, enforced, independently, by, each, state, or, territory, consider, a, handgun, a, firearm, that, firearms, started, in, china, where, gunpowder, was, first, developed, the, oldest, known, bronze, barrel, handgun, is, the, heilongjiang, hand, cannon, in, 1288, it, is, 34cm, 13, 4, inches, long, without, a, handle, and, weighs, 3, 55, kg, 7, 83, pounds, the, diameter, of, the, powder, chamber, is, 6, 6cm, 2, 6, inches, while, the, diameter, of, the, interior, at, the, end, of, the, barrel, is, 2, 5cm, 1, 0, inch, the, barrel, is, the, lengthiest, part, of, the, hand, cannon, at, 6, 9, inches, long, the, hand, cannon, has, a, bulbous, base, at, the, breech, called, the, yoshi, or, gunpowder, chamber, where, the, explosion, that, propels, the, projectile, occurs, the, walls, of, the, powder, chamber, are, noticeably, thicker, to, better, withstand, the, explosive, pressure, of, the, gunpowder, the, powder, chamber, also, has, a, touch, hole, a, small, hole, for, the, fuse, that, ignites, the, gunpowder, behind, the, gunpowder, chamber, is, a, socket, shaped, like, a, trumpet, where, the, handle, of, the, hand, cannon, is, inserted, the, bulbous, shape, of, the, base, gave, the, earliest, chinese, and, western, cannons, a, vase, like, or, pear, like, appearance, which, gradually, disappeared, when, advancements, in, metallurgical, technology, made, the, bulbous, base, obsolete, in, 1432, joseon, dynasty, under, the, reign, of, sejong, the, great, introduced, the, world, s, first, handgun, named, se, chongtong, se, chongtong, has, a, total, length, of, 13, 8, cm, an, inner, diameter, of, 0, 9, cm, and, an, outer, diameter, of, 1, 4, cm, se, chongtong, is, held, by, cheolheumja, iron, tong, handle, which, allows, quick, change, barrel, for, the, next, shot, and, fires, chase, jeon, a, type, of, standardized, arrow, of, joseon, with, a, maximum, fatal, range, of, 200, footsteps, 250, meters, initially, joseon, considered, the, gun, as, a, failed, project, due, to, its, short, effective, range, but, se, chongtong, quickly, saw, usage, after, fielding, to, the, frontier, provinces, starting, in, june, 1437, se, chongtong, was, used, by, both, soldiers, of, different, units, and, civilians, including, women, and, children, as, a, personal, defense, weapon, the, gun, was, notably, used, by, chetamja, special, reconnaissance, whose, mission, was, to, infiltrate, enemy, territory, and, by, carabiniers, carrying, multiple, guns, benefited, from, its, compact, size, the, matchlock, appeared, in, europe, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, matchlock, was, the, first, mechanism, invented, to, facilitate, the, firing, of, a, hand, held, firearm, the, classic, european, matchlock, gun, held, a, burning, slow, match, in, a, clamp, at, the, end, of, a, small, curved, lever, known, as, the, serpentine, upon, the, pulling, of, a, lever, or, in, later, models, a, trigger, protruding, from, the, bottom, of, the, gun, and, connected, to, the, serpentine, the, clamp, dropped, down, lowering, the, smoldering, match, into, the, flash, pan, and, igniting, the, priming, powder, the, flash, from, the, primer, traveled, through, the, touch, hole, igniting, the, main, charge, of, propellant, in, the, gun, barrel, on, the, release, of, the, lever, or, trigger, the, spring, loaded, serpentine, would, move, in, reverse, to, clear, the, pan, for, obvious, safety, reasons, the, match, would, be, removed, before, reloading, the, gun, both, ends, of, the, match, were, usually, kept, alight, in, case, one, end, should, be, accidentally, extinguished, the, wheellock, was, the, next, major, development, in, firearms, technology, after, the, matchlock, and, the, first, self, igniting, firearm, its, name, comes, from, the, rotating, steel, wheel, which, generates, the, ignition, developed, in, europe, around, 1500, it, was, used, alongside, the, matchlock, the, wheellock, works, by, spinning, a, spring, loaded, steel, wheel, against, a, piece, of, pyrite, to, generate, intense, sparks, which, ignite, gunpowder, in, a, pan, which, flashes, through, a, small, touchhole, to, ignite, the, main, charge, in, the, firearm, s, barrel, the, pyrite, is, clamped, in, vise, jaws, on, a, spring, loaded, arm, or, dog, which, rests, on, the, pan, cover, when, the, trigger, is, pulled, the, pan, cover, is, opened, and, the, wheel, is, rotated, with, the, pyrite, pressed, into, contact, a, close, modern, analogy, of, the, wheellock, mechanism, is, the, operation, of, a, cigarette, lighter, where, a, toothed, steel, wheel, is, spun, in, contact, with, a, piece, of, sparking, material, to, ignite, the, liquid, or, gaseous, fuel, a, wheellock, firearm, had, the, advantage, that, it, could, be, instantly, readied, and, fired, even, with, one, hand, in, contrast, to, the, then, common, matchlock, firearms, which, required, an, operator, to, prepare, a, burning, cord, of, slow, match, and, demanded, the, operator, s, full, attention, and, two, hands, to, operate, on, the, other, hand, wheellock, mechanisms, were, complex, to, make, making, them, relatively, expensive, a, flintlock, is, a, general, term, for, any, firearm, that, uses, a, flint, striking, ignition, mechanism, the, term, may, also, apply, to, a, particular, form, of, the, mechanism, itself, which, was, introduced, in, the, early, 17th, century, and, rapidly, replaced, earlier, firearm, ignition, technologies, flintlock, pistols, were, used, as, self, defense, weapons, and, as, military, arm, their, effective, range, was, short, and, they, were, frequently, used, as, an, adjunct, to, a, sword, or, cutlass, these, pistols, were, usually, smoothbore, although, some, rifled, pistols, were, produced, flintlock, pistols, came, in, a, variety, of, sizes, and, styles, which, often, overlap, and, are, not, well, defined, many, of, the, names, used, were, applied, by, collectors, and, dealers, long, after, the, pistols, were, obsolete, the, smallest, were, less, than, 15cm, 5, 9, inches, long, and, the, largest, were, over, 51cm, 20, inches, from, around, the, beginning, of, the, 1700s, the, larger, pistols, got, shorter, so, that, by, the, late, 1700s, the, largest, were, closer, to, 41cm, 16, inches, long, the, smallest, would, fit, into, a, typical, pocket, or, a, hand, warming, muff, and, could, easily, be, carried, the, largest, sizes, would, be, carried, in, holsters, across, a, horse, s, back, just, ahead, of, the, saddle, in, between, sizes, included, the, coat, pocket, pistol, or, coat, pistol, which, would, fit, into, a, large, pocket, coach, pistols, meant, to, be, carried, on, or, under, the, seat, of, a, coach, in, a, bag, or, box, and, belt, pistols, sometimes, equipped, with, a, hook, designed, to, slip, over, a, belt, or, waistband, larger, pistols, were, called, horse, pistols, a, notable, mechanical, development, of, the, flintlock, pistol, was, the, english, duelling, pistol, it, was, highly, reliable, water, resistant, and, accurate, external, decoration, was, typically, minimal, but, the, internal, works, were, often, finished, to, a, higher, degree, of, craftsmanship, than, the, exterior, duelling, pistols, were, the, size, of, the, horse, pistols, of, the, late, 1700s, around, 41cm, 16, inches, long, and, were, usually, sold, in, pairs, along, with, accessories, in, a, wooden, case, with, compartments, for, each, piece, the, caplock, mechanism, or, percussion, lock, was, developed, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, used, a, percussion, cap, struck, by, the, hammer, to, set, off, the, main, charge, rather, than, using, a, piece, of, flint, to, strike, a, steel, frizzen, they, succeeded, the, flintlock, mechanism, in, firearm, technology, the, rudimentary, percussion, system, was, developed, by, reverend, alexander, john, forsyth, as, a, solution, to, the, problem, that, birds, would, startle, when, smoke, puffed, from, the, powder, pan, of, his, flintlock, shotgun, giving, them, sufficient, warning, to, escape, the, shot, his, invention, of, a, fulminate, primed, firing, mechanism, deprived, the, birds, of, their, early, warning, system, both, by, avoiding, the, initial, puff, of, smoke, from, the, flintlock, powder, pan, as, well, as, shortening, the, interval, between, the, trigger, pull, and, the, shot, leaving, the, muzzle, forsyth, patented, his, ignition, system, in, 1807, however, it, was, not, until, after, forsyth, s, patents, expired, that, the, conventional, percussion, cap, system, was, developed, the, caplock, offered, many, improvements, over, the, flintlock, the, caplock, was, easier, to, load, more, resistant, to, weather, and, was, much, more, reliable, than, the, flintlock, many, older, flintlock, weapons, were, later, converted, into, caplocks, so, that, they, could, take, advantage, of, this, increased, reliability, the, caplock, mechanism, consists, of, a, hammer, similar, to, the, hammer, used, in, a, flintlock, and, a, nipple, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, cone, which, holds, a, small, percussion, cap, the, nipple, contains, a, tube, that, goes, into, the, barrel, the, percussion, cap, contains, a, chemical, compound, called, mercury, fulminate, or, fulminate, of, mercury, the, chemical, formula, of, which, is, hg, onc, 2, it, is, made, from, mercury, nitric, acid, and, alcohol, when, the, trigger, releases, the, hammer, it, strikes, the, cap, causing, the, mercuric, fulminate, to, explode, the, flames, from, this, explosion, travel, down, the, tube, in, the, nipple, and, enter, the, barrel, where, they, ignite, the, main, powder, charge, in, 1836, samuel, colt, patented, the, colt, paterson, the, first, practical, mass, produced, revolver, it, uses, a, revolving, cylinder, with, multiple, chambers, aligned, with, a, single, stationary, barrel, initially, this, 5, shot, revolver, was, produced, in, 28, caliber, with, a, 36, caliber, model, following, a, year, later, as, originally, designed, and, produced, no, loading, lever, was, included, with, the, revolver, a, user, had, to, partially, disassemble, the, revolver, to, re, load, it, starting, in, 1839, a, reloading, lever, and, a, capping, window, were, incorporated, into, the, design, allowing, reloading, without, requiring, partial, disassembly, of, the, revolver, this, loading, lever, and, capping, window, design, change, was, also, incorporated, into, most, colt, paterson, revolvers, that, had, been, produced, from, 1836, until, 1839, unlike, later, revolvers, a, folding, trigger, was, incorporated, into, the, colt, paterson, the, trigger, only, became, visible, upon, cocking, the, hammer, colt, would, go, on, to, make, a, series, of, improved, revolvers, the, colt, walker, was, a, single, action, revolver, with, a, revolving, cylinder, holding, six, charges, of, black, powder, behind, six, bullets, typically, 44, caliber, lead, balls, it, was, designed, in, 1846, as, a, collaboration, between, captain, samuel, hamilton, walker, and, american, firearms, inventor, samuel, colt, the, 1847, colt, walker, was, the, largest, and, most, powerful, black, powder, repeating, handgun, that, was, ever, made, the, colt, 1851, navy, revolver, is, a, cap, and, ball, revolver, that, was, designed, by, samuel, colt, between, 1847, and, 1850, the, six, round, 36, caliber, navy, revolver, was, much, lighter, than, the, contemporary, colt, dragoon, revolvers, developed, from, the, 44, walker, colt, revolvers, of, 1847, which, given, their, size, and, weight, were, generally, carried, in, saddle, holsters, it, is, an, enlarged, version, of, the, 31, caliber, colt, pocket, percussion, revolvers, that, evolved, from, the, earlier, baby, dragoon, and, like, them, is, a, mechanically, improved, and, simplified, descendant, of, the, 1836, paterson, revolver, as, the, factory, designation, implied, the, navy, revolver, was, suitably, sized, for, carrying, in, a, belt, holster, it, became, very, popular, in, north, america, at, the, time, of, western, expansion, colt, s, aggressive, promotions, distributed, the, navy, and, his, other, revolvers, across, europe, asia, and, africa, the, 36, caliber, 375, 380, inch, round, lead, ball, weighs, 80, grains, and, at, a, velocity, of, 1, 000, feet, per, second, is, comparable, to, the, modern, 380, pistol, cartridge, in, power, loads, consist, of, loose, powder, and, ball, or, bullet, metallic, foil, cartridges, early, and, combustible, paper, cartridges, civil, war, era, all, combinations, being, ignited, by, a, fulminate, percussion, cap, applied, to, the, nipples, at, the, rear, of, the, chamber, the, colt, army, model, 1860, is, a, 6, shot, muzzle, loaded, cap, ball, 44, caliber, single, action, revolver, used, during, the, american, civil, war, made, by, colt, s, manufacturing, company, it, was, used, as, a, side, arm, by, cavalry, infantry, artillery, troops, and, naval, forces, more, than, 200, 000, were, manufactured, from, 1860, through, 1873, colt, s, biggest, customer, was, the, us, government, with, more, than, 129, 730, units, being, purchased, and, issued, to, the, troops, the, weapon, was, a, single, action, six, shot, weapon, accurate, up, to, 75, to, 100, yards, where, the, fixed, sights, were, typically, set, when, manufactured, the, rear, sight, was, a, notch, in, the, hammer, only, usable, when, the, revolver, was, fully, cocked, the, colt, 44, caliber, army, model, was, the, most, widely, used, revolver, of, the, civil, war, it, had, a, six, shot, rotating, cylinder, and, fired, a, 0, 454, inch, diameter, 11, 5, mm, round, spherical, lead, ball, or, a, conical, tipped, bullet, typically, propelled, by, a, 30, grain, charge, of, black, powder, which, was, ignited, by, a, small, copper, percussion, cap, that, contained, a, volatile, charge, of, fulminate, of, mercury, a, substance, that, explodes, upon, being, subjected, to, a, sharp, impact, the, percussion, cap, when, struck, by, the, hammer, ignited, the, powder, charge, when, fired, the, balls, had, a, muzzle, velocity, of, about, 900, feet, per, second, 274, meters, second, although, this, depended, on, how, much, powder, was, loaded, the, smith, wesson, model, 1, was, the, first, firearm, manufactured, by, smith, wesson, with, production, spanning, the, years, 1857, through, 1882, it, was, the, first, commercially, successful, revolver, to, use, metallic, rimfire, cartridges, instead, of, loose, powder, musket, ball, and, percussion, caps, it, is, a, single, action, tip, up, revolver, holding, seven, 22, short, black, powder, cartridges, the, smith, wesson, model, no, 2, army, is, a, 6, shot, 32, caliber, revolver, intended, to, combine, the, small, size, and, convenience, of, the, smith, wesson, model, 1, 22, rimfire, with, a, larger, more, effective, cartridge, it, was, manufactured, 1861, 1874, with, a, total, production, of, 77, 020, units, the, smith, wesson, model, 3, was, a, 6, shot, single, action, cartridge, firing, top, break, revolver, produced, by, smith, wesson, from, c, 1870, to, 1915, and, was, recently, offered, again, as, a, reproduction, by, smith, wesson, and, uberti, the, s, w, model, 3, was, originally, chambered, for, the, 44, american, and, 44, russian, cartridges, and, typically, did, not, have, the, cartridge, information, stamped, on, the, gun, as, is, standard, practice, for, most, commercial, firearms, model, 3, revolvers, were, later, produced, in, an, assortment, of, calibers, including, 44, henry, rimfire, 44, 40, 32, 44, 38, 44, and, 45, schofield, the, design, would, influence, the, smaller, s, w, 38, single, action, that, is, retroactively, referred, to, as, the, model, 2, all, of, these, revolvers, would, automatically, eject, the, spent, shell, cases, when, opened, the, colt, single, action, army, also, known, as, the, single, action, army, saa, model, p, peacemaker, m1873, and, colt, 45, is, a, single, action, revolver, with, a, revolving, cylinder, holding, six, metallic, cartridges, it, was, designed, for, the, u, s, government, service, revolver, trials, of, 1872, by, colt, s, patent, firearms, manufacturing, company, today, s, colt, s, manufacturing, company, and, was, adopted, as, the, standard, military, service, revolver, until, 1892, the, colt, saa, has, been, offered, in, over, 30, different, calibers, and, various, barrel, lengths, its, overall, appearance, has, remained, consistent, since, 1873, colt, has, discontinued, its, production, twice, but, brought, it, back, due, to, popular, demand, the, revolver, was, popular, with, ranchers, lawmen, and, outlaws, alike, but, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, models, are, mostly, bought, by, collectors, and, cowboy, action, shooters, its, design, has, influenced, the, production, of, numerous, other, models, from, other, companies, the, colt, saa, peacemaker, revolver, is, a, famous, piece, of, americana, known, as, the, gun, that, won, the, west, in, 1889, colt, introduced, the, model, 1889, the, first, truly, modern, double, action, revolver, which, differed, from, earlier, double, action, revolvers, by, having, a, swing, out, cylinder, as, opposed, to, a, top, break, or, side, loading, cylinder, swing, out, cylinders, quickly, caught, on, because, they, combined, the, best, features, of, earlier, designs, top, break, actions, gave, the, ability, to, eject, all, empty, shells, simultaneously, and, exposed, all, chambers, for, easy, reloading, but, having, the, frame, hinged, into, two, halves, weakened, the, gun, and, negatively, affected, accuracy, due, to, lack, of, rigidity, side, loaders, like, the, earlier, colt, model, 1871, and, 1873, gave, a, rigid, frame, but, required, the, user, to, eject, and, load, one, cylinder, at, a, time, as, they, rotated, the, cylinder, to, line, each, chamber, up, with, the, side, mounted, loading, gate, smith, wesson, followed, 7, years, later, with, the, hand, ejector, model, 1896, in, 32, s, w, long, caliber, followed, by, the, very, similar, yet, improved, model, 1899, later, known, as, the, model, 10, which, introduced, the, new, 38, special, cartridge, the, model, 10, went, on, to, become, the, best, selling, handgun, of, the, 20th, century, at, 6, 000, 000, units, and, the, 38, special, is, still, the, most, popular, chambering, for, revolvers, in, the, world, these, new, guns, were, an, improvement, over, the, colt, 1889, design, since, they, incorporated, a, combined, center, pin, and, ejector, rod, to, lock, the, cylinder, in, position, the, 1889, did, not, use, a, center, pin, and, the, cylinder, was, prone, to, move, out, of, alignment, the, smith, wesson, model, 36, is, a, 5, shot, revolver, chambered, for, 38, special, it, is, one, of, several, models, of, j, frame, smith, wesson, revolvers, it, was, introduced, in, 1950, and, is, still, in, production, the, model, 36, was, designed, in, the, era, just, after, world, war, ii, when, smith, wesson, stopped, producing, war, materials, and, resumed, normal, production, for, the, model, 36, they, sought, to, design, a, revolver, that, could, fire, the, more, powerful, 38, special, round, in, a, small, concealable, package, since, the, older, i, frame, was, not, able, to, handle, this, load, a, new, frame, was, designed, which, became, the, smith, wesson, j, frame, the, inventions, of, the, metallic, cartridge, and, then, smokeless, powder, had, allowed, for, dramatic, improvements, in, handgun, ballistics, standardization, and, adherence, to, cartridge, standards, originating, in, the, black, powder, cartridge, era, resulted, in, cartridge, capacity, in, excess, of, peak, combustion, pressure, standards, smokeless, powder, did, not, take, up, as, much, volume, as, black, powder, and, cases, like, the, 38, special, and, 45, colt, were, much, larger, than, 9, 19mm, and, 45, acp, which, had, similar, ballistics, respectively, as, metallurgy, was, improved, handloaders, began, experimenting, with, loading, the, 38, special, and, 44, special, cartridges, with, fuller, cases, of, smokeless, propellants, by, 1929, the, 38, 44, cartridge, and, a, large, n, framed, smith, wesson, 38, 44, revolver, chambered, for, this, cartridge, was, available, by, the, 1930s, automobiles, with, heavy, steel, bodies, had, become, popular, and, the, improved, ballistics, of, more, powerful, handguns, was, in, demand, colt, had, similarly, introduced, the, 38, super, simply, a, 38, acp, loaded, to, higher, pressure, with, more, powder, in, 1935, smith, and, wesson, released, the, registered, magnum, later, referred, to, as, the, smith, wesson, model, 27, which, was, the, first, revolver, chambered, for, 357, magnum, it, was, designed, as, a, more, powerful, handgun, for, law, enforcement, officers, the, registered, magnum, marked, the, beginning, of, the, magnum, era, of, handguns, notably, elmer, keith, continued, to, demonstrate, and, advocate, the, use, of, the, 44, special, at, higher, pressures, the, high, point, of, the, magnum, era, was, in, 1955, when, smith, wesson, released, the, smith, wesson, model, 29, in, 44, magnum, two, decades, later, the, dirty, harry, movies, made, this, gun, a, cultural, icon, the, s, w, model, 19, was, also, introduced, in, 1955, it, is, a, 357, magnum, revolver, produced, by, smith, wesson, on, its, k, frame, design, the, model, 19, is, smaller, and, lighter, than, the, original, the, s, w, model, 27, 357, magnums, it, was, made, at, the, behest, of, retired, assistant, chief, patrol, inspector, of, the,
