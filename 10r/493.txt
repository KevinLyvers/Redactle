armour, commonwealth, english, or, armor, american, english, see, spelling, differences, is, a, covering, used, to, protect, an, object, individual, or, vehicle, from, physical, injury, or, damage, especially, direct, contact, weapons, or, projectiles, during, combat, or, from, a, potentially, dangerous, environment, or, activity, e, g, cycling, construction, sites, etc, personal, armour, is, used, to, protect, soldiers, and, war, animals, vehicle, armour, is, used, on, warships, armoured, fighting, vehicles, and, some, combat, aircraft, mostly, ground, attack, aircraft, a, second, use, of, the, term, armour, describes, armoured, forces, armoured, weapons, and, their, role, in, combat, after, the, development, of, armoured, warfare, tanks, and, mechanised, infantry, and, their, combat, formations, came, to, be, referred, to, collectively, as, armour, the, word, armour, began, to, appear, in, the, middle, ages, as, a, derivative, of, old, french, it, is, dated, from, 1297, as, a, mail, defensive, covering, worn, in, combat, the, word, originates, from, the, old, french, armure, itself, derived, from, the, latin, armatura, meaning, arms, and, or, equipment, with, the, root, armare, meaning, arms, or, gear, armour, has, been, used, throughout, recorded, history, it, has, been, made, from, a, variety, of, materials, beginning, with, the, use, of, leathers, or, fabrics, as, protection, and, evolving, through, chain, mail, and, metal, plate, into, today, s, modern, composites, for, much, of, military, history, the, manufacture, of, metal, personal, armour, has, dominated, the, technology, and, employment, of, armour, armour, drove, the, development, of, many, important, technologies, of, the, ancient, world, including, wood, lamination, mining, metal, refining, vehicle, manufacture, leather, processing, and, later, decorative, metal, working, its, production, was, influential, in, the, industrial, revolution, and, furthered, commercial, development, of, metallurgy, and, engineering, armour, was, also, an, important, factor, in, the, development, of, firearms, which, in, turn, revolutionised, warfare, significant, factors, in, the, development, of, armour, include, the, economic, and, technological, necessities, of, its, production, for, instance, plate, armour, first, appeared, in, medieval, europe, when, water, powered, trip, hammers, made, the, formation, of, plates, faster, and, cheaper, at, times, the, development, of, armour, has, paralleled, the, development, of, increasingly, effective, weaponry, on, the, battlefield, with, armourers, seeking, to, create, better, protection, without, sacrificing, mobility, well, known, armour, types, in, european, history, include, the, lorica, hamata, lorica, squamata, and, the, lorica, segmentata, of, the, roman, legions, the, mail, hauberk, of, the, early, medieval, age, and, the, full, steel, plate, harness, worn, by, later, medieval, and, renaissance, knights, and, breast, and, back, plates, worn, by, heavy, cavalry, in, several, european, countries, until, the, first, year, of, world, war, i, 1914, 1915, the, samurai, warriors, of, feudal, japan, utilised, many, types, of, armour, for, hundreds, of, years, up, to, the, 19th, century, cuirasses, and, helmets, were, manufactured, in, japan, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, tank, worn, by, foot, soldiers, and, keik, worn, by, horsemen, were, both, pre, samurai, types, of, early, japanese, armour, constructed, from, iron, plates, connected, together, by, leather, thongs, japanese, lamellar, armour, keiko, passed, through, korea, and, reached, japan, around, the, 5th, century, these, early, japanese, lamellar, armours, took, the, form, of, a, sleeveless, jacket, leggings, and, a, helmet, armour, did, not, always, cover, all, of, the, body, sometimes, no, more, than, a, helmet, and, leg, plates, were, worn, the, rest, of, the, body, was, generally, protected, by, means, of, a, large, shield, examples, of, armies, equipping, their, troops, in, this, fashion, were, the, aztecs, 13th, to, 15th, century, ce, in, east, asia, many, types, of, armour, were, commonly, used, at, different, times, by, various, cultures, including, scale, armour, lamellar, armour, laminar, armour, plated, mail, mail, plate, armour, and, brigandine, around, the, dynastic, tang, song, and, early, ming, period, cuirasses, and, plates, mingguangjia, were, also, used, with, more, elaborate, versions, for, officers, in, war, the, chinese, during, that, time, used, partial, plates, for, important, body, parts, instead, of, covering, their, whole, body, since, too, much, plate, armour, hinders, their, martial, arts, movement, the, other, body, parts, were, covered, in, cloth, leather, lamellar, or, mountain, pattern, armor, in, pre, qin, dynasty, times, leather, armour, was, made, out, of, various, animals, with, more, exotic, ones, such, as, the, rhinoceros, mail, sometimes, called, chainmail, made, of, interlocking, iron, rings, is, believed, to, have, first, appeared, some, time, after, 300, bc, its, invention, is, credited, to, the, celts, the, romans, are, thought, to, have, adopted, their, design, gradually, small, additional, plates, or, discs, of, iron, were, added, to, the, mail, to, protect, vulnerable, areas, hardened, leather, and, splinted, construction, were, used, for, arm, and, leg, pieces, the, coat, of, plates, was, developed, an, armour, made, of, large, plates, sewn, inside, a, textile, or, leather, coat, early, plate, in, italy, and, elsewhere, in, the, 13th, 15th, century, were, made, of, iron, iron, armour, could, be, carburised, or, case, hardened, to, give, a, surface, of, harder, steel, plate, armour, became, cheaper, than, mail, by, the, 15th, century, as, it, required, much, less, labour, and, labour, had, become, much, more, expensive, after, the, black, death, though, it, did, require, larger, furnaces, to, produce, larger, blooms, mail, continued, to, be, used, to, protect, those, joints, which, could, not, be, adequately, protected, by, plate, such, as, the, armpit, crook, of, the, elbow, and, groin, another, advantage, of, plate, was, that, a, lance, rest, could, be, fitted, to, the, breast, plate, the, small, skull, cap, evolved, into, a, bigger, true, helmet, the, bascinet, as, it, was, lengthened, downward, to, protect, the, back, of, the, neck, and, the, sides, of, the, head, additionally, several, new, forms, of, fully, enclosed, helmets, were, introduced, in, the, late, 14th, century, probably, the, most, recognised, style, of, armour, in, the, world, became, the, plate, armour, associated, with, the, knights, of, the, european, late, middle, ages, but, continuing, to, the, early, 17th, century, age, of, enlightenment, in, all, european, countries, by, 1400, the, full, harness, of, plate, armour, had, been, developed, in, armouries, of, lombardy, heavy, cavalry, dominated, the, battlefield, for, centuries, in, part, because, of, their, armour, in, the, early, 15th, century, advances, in, weaponry, allowed, infantry, to, defeat, armoured, knights, on, the, battlefield, the, quality, of, the, metal, used, in, armour, deteriorated, as, armies, became, bigger, and, armour, was, made, thicker, necessitating, breeding, of, larger, cavalry, horses, if, during, the, 14, 15th, centuries, armour, seldom, weighed, more, than, 15, kg, then, by, the, late, 16th, century, it, weighed, 25, kg, the, increasing, weight, and, thickness, of, late, 16th, century, armour, therefore, gave, substantial, resistance, in, the, early, years, of, low, velocity, firearms, full, suits, of, armour, or, breast, plates, actually, stopped, bullets, fired, from, a, modest, distance, crossbow, bolts, if, still, in, use, would, seldom, penetrate, good, plate, nor, would, any, bullet, unless, fired, from, close, range, in, effect, rather, than, making, plate, armour, obsolete, the, use, of, firearms, stimulated, the, development, of, plate, armour, into, its, later, stages, for, most, of, that, period, it, allowed, horsemen, to, fight, while, being, the, targets, of, defending, arquebusiers, without, being, easily, killed, full, suits, of, armour, were, actually, worn, by, generals, and, princely, commanders, right, up, to, the, second, decade, of, the, 18th, century, it, was, the, only, way, they, could, be, mounted, and, survey, the, overall, battlefield, with, safety, from, distant, musket, fire, the, horse, was, afforded, protection, from, lances, and, infantry, weapons, by, steel, plate, barding, this, gave, the, horse, protection, and, enhanced, the, visual, impression, of, a, mounted, knight, late, in, the, era, elaborate, barding, was, used, in, parade, armour, gradually, starting, in, the, mid, 16th, century, one, plate, element, after, another, was, discarded, to, save, weight, for, foot, soldiers, back, and, breast, plates, continued, to, be, used, throughout, the, entire, period, of, the, 18th, century, and, through, napoleonic, times, in, many, european, heavy, cavalry, units, until, the, early, 20th, century, from, their, introduction, muskets, could, pierce, plate, armour, so, cavalry, had, to, be, far, more, mindful, of, the, fire, in, japan, armour, continued, to, be, used, until, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, last, major, fighting, in, which, armour, was, used, this, occurred, in, 1868, samurai, armour, had, one, last, short, lived, use, in, 1877, during, the, satsuma, rebellion, though, the, age, of, the, knight, was, over, armour, continued, to, be, used, in, many, capacities, soldiers, in, the, american, civil, war, bought, iron, and, steel, vests, from, peddlers, both, sides, had, considered, but, rejected, body, armour, for, standard, issue, the, effectiveness, of, the, vests, varied, widely, some, successfully, deflected, bullets, and, saved, lives, but, others, were, poorly, made, and, resulted, in, tragedy, for, the, soldiers, in, any, case, the, vests, were, abandoned, by, many, soldiers, due, to, their, increased, weight, on, long, marches, as, well, as, the, stigma, they, got, for, being, cowards, from, their, fellow, troops, at, the, start, of, world, war, i, thousands, of, the, french, cuirassiers, rode, out, to, engage, the, german, cavalry, by, that, period, the, shiny, metallic, cuirass, was, covered, in, a, dark, paint, and, a, canvas, wrap, covered, their, elaborate, napoleonic, style, helmets, to, help, mitigate, the, sunlight, being, reflected, off, the, surfaces, thereby, alerting, the, enemy, of, their, location, their, armour, was, only, meant, for, protection, against, edged, weapons, such, as, bayonets, sabres, and, lances, cavalry, had, to, be, wary, of, repeating, rifles, machine, guns, and, artillery, unlike, the, foot, soldiers, who, at, least, had, a, trench, to, give, them, some, protection, today, ballistic, vests, also, known, as, flak, jackets, made, of, ballistic, cloth, e, g, kevlar, dyneema, twaron, spectra, etc, and, ceramic, or, metal, plates, are, common, among, police, officers, security, guards, corrections, officers, and, some, branches, of, the, military, the, us, army, has, adopted, interceptor, body, armour, which, uses, enhanced, small, arms, protective, inserts, esapis, in, the, chest, sides, and, back, of, the, armour, each, plate, is, rated, to, stop, a, range, of, ammunition, including, 3, hits, from, a, 7, 62, 51, nato, ap, round, at, a, range, of, 10, m, 33, ft, dragon, skin, is, another, ballistic, vest, which, is, currently, in, testing, with, mixed, results, as, of, 2019, it, has, been, deemed, too, heavy, expensive, and, unreliable, in, comparison, to, more, traditional, plates, and, it, is, outdated, in, protection, compared, to, modern, us, iotv, armour, and, even, in, testing, was, deemed, a, downgrade, from, the, iba, the, british, armed, forces, also, have, their, own, armour, known, as, osprey, it, is, rated, to, the, same, general, equivalent, standard, as, the, us, counterpart, the, improved, outer, tactical, vest, and, now, the, soldier, plate, carrier, system, and, modular, tactical, vest, the, russian, armed, forces, also, have, armour, known, as, the, 6b43, all, the, way, to, 6b45, depending, on, variant, their, armour, runs, on, the, gost, system, which, due, to, regional, conditions, has, resulted, in, a, technically, higher, protective, level, overall, the, first, modern, production, technology, for, armour, plating, was, used, by, navies, in, the, construction, of, the, ironclad, warship, reaching, its, pinnacle, of, development, with, the, battleship, the, first, tanks, were, produced, during, world, war, i, aerial, armour, has, been, used, to, protect, pilots, and, aircraft, systems, since, the, first, world, war, in, modern, ground, forces, usage, the, meaning, of, armour, has, expanded, to, include, the, role, of, troops, in, combat, after, the, evolution, of, armoured, warfare, mechanised, infantry, were, mounted, in, armoured, fighting, vehicles, and, replaced, light, infantry, in, many, situations, in, modern, armoured, warfare, armoured, units, equipped, with, tanks, and, infantry, fighting, vehicles, serve, the, historic, role, of, heavy, cavalry, light, cavalry, and, dragoons, and, belong, to, the, armoured, branch, of, warfare, the, first, ironclad, battleship, with, iron, armour, over, a, wooden, hull, gloire, was, launched, by, the, french, navy, in, 1859, prompting, the, british, royal, navy, to, build, a, counter, the, following, year, they, launched, hms, warrior, which, was, twice, the, size, and, had, iron, armour, over, an, iron, hull, after, the, first, battle, between, two, ironclads, took, place, in, 1862, during, the, american, civil, war, it, became, clear, that, the, ironclad, had, replaced, the, unarmoured, line, of, battle, ship, as, the, most, powerful, warship, afloat, ironclads, were, designed, for, several, roles, including, as, high, seas, battleships, coastal, defence, ships, and, long, range, cruisers, the, rapid, evolution, of, warship, design, in, the, late, 19th, century, transformed, the, ironclad, from, a, wooden, hulled, vessel, which, carried, sails, to, supplement, its, steam, engines, into, the, steel, built, turreted, battleships, and, cruisers, familiar, in, the, 20th, century, this, change, was, pushed, forward, by, the, development, of, heavier, naval, guns, the, ironclads, of, the, 1880s, carried, some, of, the, heaviest, guns, ever, mounted, at, sea, more, sophisticated, steam, engines, and, advances, in, metallurgy, which, made, steel, shipbuilding, possible, the, rapid, pace, of, change, in, the, ironclad, period, meant, that, many, ships, were, obsolete, as, soon, as, they, were, complete, and, that, naval, tactics, were, in, a, state, of, flux, many, ironclads, were, built, to, make, use, of, the, ram, or, the, torpedo, which, a, number, of, naval, designers, considered, the, crucial, weapons, of, naval, combat, there, is, no, clear, end, to, the, ironclad, period, but, towards, the, end, of, the, 1890s, the, term, ironclad, dropped, out, of, use, new, ships, were, increasingly, constructed, to, a, standard, pattern, and, designated, battleships, or, armoured, cruisers, armoured, trains, saw, use, from, the, mid, 19th, to, the, mid, 20th, century, including, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 1871, the, first, and, second, boer, wars, 1880, 81, and, 1899, 1902, the, polish, soviet, war, 1919, 1921, the, first, 1914, 1918, and, second, world, wars, 1939, 1945, and, the, first, indochina, war, 1946, 1954, the, most, intensive, use, of, armoured, trains, was, during, the, russian, civil, war, 1918, 1920, ancient, siege, engines, were, usually, protected, by, wooden, armour, often, covered, with, wet, hides, or, thin, metal, to, prevent, being, easily, burned, medieval, war, wagons, were, horse, drawn, wagons, that, were, similarly, armoured, these, contained, guns, or, crossbowmen, that, could, fire, through, gun, slits, the, first, modern, armoured, fighting, vehicles, were, armoured, cars, developed, c, 1900, these, started, as, ordinary, wheeled, motor, cars, protected, by, iron, shields, typically, mounting, a, machine, gun, during, the, first, world, war, the, stalemate, of, trench, warfare, during, on, the, western, front, spurred, the, development, of, the, tank, it, was, envisioned, as, an, armoured, machine, that, could, advance, under, fire, from, enemy, rifles, and, machine, guns, and, respond, with, its, own, heavy, guns, it, used, caterpillar, tracks, to, cross, ground, broken, up, by, shellfire, and, trenches, with, the, development, of, effective, anti, aircraft, artillery, in, the, period, before, the, second, world, war, military, pilots, once, the, knights, of, the, air, during, the, first, world, war, became, far, more, vulnerable, to, ground, fire, as, a, response, armour, plating, was, added, to, aircraft, to, protect, aircrew, and, vulnerable, areas, such, as, engines, and, fuel, tanks, self, sealing, fuel, tanks, functioned, like, armour, in, that, they, added, protection, but, also, increased, weight, and, cost, tank, armour, has, progressed, from, the, second, world, war, armour, forms, now, incorporating, not, only, harder, composites, but, also, reactive, armour, designed, to, defeat, shaped, charges, as, a, result, of, this, the, main, battle, tank, mbt, conceived, in, the, cold, war, era, can, survive, multiple, rocket, propelled, grenade, strikes, with, minimal, effect, on, the, crew, or, the, operation, of, the, vehicle, the, light, tanks, that, were, the, last, descendants, of, the, light, cavalry, during, the, second, world, war, have, almost, completely, disappeared, from, the, world, s, militaries, due, to, increased, lethality, of, the, weapons, available, to, the, vehicle, mounted, infantry, the, armoured, personnel, carrier, apc, was, devised, during, the, first, world, war, it, allows, the, safe, and, rapid, movement, of, infantry, in, a, combat, zone, minimising, casualties, and, maximising, mobility, apcs, are, fundamentally, different, from, the, previously, used, armoured, half, tracks, in, that, they, offer, a, higher, level, of, protection, from, artillery, burst, fragments, and, greater, mobility, in, more, terrain, types, the, basic, apc, design, was, substantially, expanded, to, an, infantry, fighting, vehicle, ifv, when, properties, of, an, apc, and, a, light, tank, were, combined, in, one, vehicle, naval, armour, has, fundamentally, changed, from, the, second, world, war, doctrine, of, thicker, plating, to, defend, against, shells, bombs, and, torpedoes, passive, defence, naval, armour, is, limited, to, kevlar, or, steel, either, single, layer, or, as, spaced, armour, protecting, particularly, vital, areas, from, the, effects, of, nearby, impacts, since, ships, cannot, carry, enough, armour, to, completely, protect, against, anti, ship, missiles, they, depend, more, on, defensive, weapons, destroying, incoming, missiles, or, causing, them, to, miss, by, confusing, their, guidance, systems, with, electronic, warfare, although, the, role, of, the, ground, attack, aircraft, significantly, diminished, after, the, korean, war, it, re, emerged, during, the, vietnam, war, and, in, the, recognition, of, this, the, us, air, force, authorised, the, design, and, production, of, what, became, the, a, 10, dedicated, anti, armour, and, ground, attack, aircraft, that, first, saw, action, in, the, gulf, war, high, voltage, transformer, fire, barriers, are, often, required, to, defeat, ballistics, from, small, arms, as, well, as, projectiles, from, transformer, bushings, and, lightning, arresters, which, form, part, of, large, electrical, transformers, per, nfpa, 850, such, fire, barriers, may, be, designed, to, inherently, function, as, armour, or, may, be, passive, fire, protection, materials, augmented, by, armour, where, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, that, the, armour, s, reaction, to, fire, does, not, cause, issues, with, regards, to, the, fire, barrier, being, armoured, to, defeat, explosions, and, projectiles, in, addition, to, fire, especially, since, both, functions, must, be, provided, simultaneously, meaning, they, must, be, fire, tested, together, to, provide, realistic, evidence, of, fitness, for, purpose, combat, drones, use, little, to, no, vehicular, armour, as, they, are, not, crewed, vessels, this, results, in, them, being, lightweight, and, small, in, size, body, armour, for, war, horses, has, been, used, since, at, least, 2000, bc, cloth, leather, and, metal, protection, covered, cavalry, horses, in, ancient, civilisations, including, ancient, egypt, assyria, persia, and, rome, some, formed, heavy, cavalry, units, of, armoured, horses, and, riders, used, to, attack, infantry, and, mounted, archers, armour, for, horses, is, called, barding, also, spelled, bard, or, barb, especially, when, used, by, european, knights, during, the, late, middle, ages, as, armour, protection, for, knights, became, more, effective, their, mounts, became, targets, this, vulnerability, was, exploited, by, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, bannockburn, in, the, 14th, century, when, horses, were, killed, by, the, infantry, and, for, the, english, at, the, battle, of, cr, cy, in, the, same, century, where, longbowmen, shot, horses, and, the, then, dismounted, french, knights, were, killed, by, heavy, infantry, barding, developed, as, a, response, to, such, events, examples, of, armour, for, horses, could, be, found, as, far, back, as, classical, antiquity, cataphracts, with, scale, armour, for, both, rider, and, horse, are, believed, by, many, historians, to, have, influenced, the, later, european, knights, via, contact, with, the, byzantine, empire, surviving, period, examples, of, barding, are, rare, however, complete, sets, are, on, display, at, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, the, wallace, collection, in, london, the, royal, armouries, in, leeds, and, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, horse, armour, could, be, made, in, whole, or, in, part, of, cuir, bouilli, hardened, leather, but, surviving, examples, of, this, are, especially, rare, war, elephants, were, first, used, in, ancient, times, without, armour, but, armour, was, introduced, because, elephants, injured, by, enemy, weapons, would, often, flee, the, battlefield, elephant, armour, was, often, made, from, hardened, leather, which, was, fitted, onto, an, individual, elephant, while, moist, then, dried, to, create, a, hardened, shell, alternatively, metal, armour, pieces, were, sometimes, sewn, into, heavy, cloth, later, lamellar, armour, small, overlapping, metal, plates, was, introduced, full, plate, armour, was, not, typically, used, due, to, its, expense, and, the, danger, of, the, animal, overheating
