a, vehicle, from, latin, vehiculum, is, a, machine, designed, for, self, propulsion, usually, to, transport, people, cargo, or, both, vehicles, include, wagons, bicycles, motor, vehicles, motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility, scooters, railed, vehicles, trains, trams, watercraft, ships, boats, underwater, vehicles, amphibious, vehicles, screw, propelled, vehicles, hovercraft, aircraft, airplanes, helicopters, aerostats, and, spacecraft, ground, vehicles, can, be, broadly, classified, by, the, type, of, contact, with, the, ground, wheels, tracks, rails, or, skis, iso, 3833, 1977, is, the, international, standard, for, road, vehicle, types, terms, and, definitions, it, is, estimated, by, historians, that, boats, have, been, used, since, prehistory, rock, paintings, depicting, boats, dated, from, around, 50, 000, to, 15, 000, bc, were, found, in, australia, the, oldest, boats, found, by, archaeological, excavation, are, logboats, with, the, oldest, logboat, found, the, pesse, canoe, found, in, a, bog, in, the, netherlands, being, carbon, dated, to, 8040, 7510, bc, making, it, 9, 500, 10, 000, years, old, a, 7, 000, year, old, seagoing, boat, made, from, reeds, and, tar, has, been, found, in, kuwait, boats, were, used, between, 4000, 3000, bc, in, sumer, ancient, egypt, and, in, the, indian, ocean, there, is, evidence, of, camel, pulled, wheeled, vehicles, about, 4000, 3000, bc, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, wagonway, a, predecessor, of, the, railway, found, so, far, was, the, 6, to, 8, 5, km, 4, to, 5, mi, long, diolkos, wagonway, which, transported, boats, across, the, isthmus, of, corinth, in, greece, since, around, 600, bc, wheeled, vehicles, pulled, by, men, and, animals, ran, in, grooves, in, limestone, which, provided, the, track, element, preventing, the, wagons, from, leaving, the, intended, route, in, 200, ce, ma, jun, built, a, south, pointing, chariot, a, vehicle, with, an, early, form, of, guidance, system, the, stagecoach, a, four, wheeled, vehicle, drawn, by, horses, originated, in, 13th, century, england, railways, began, reappearing, in, europe, after, the, dark, ages, the, earliest, known, record, of, a, railway, in, europe, from, this, period, is, a, stained, glass, window, in, the, minster, of, freiburg, im, breisgau, dating, from, around, 1350, in, 1515, cardinal, matth, us, lang, wrote, a, description, of, the, reisszug, a, funicular, railway, at, the, hohensalzburg, fortress, in, austria, the, line, originally, used, wooden, rails, and, a, hemp, haulage, rope, and, was, operated, by, human, or, animal, power, through, a, treadwheel, 1769, nicolas, joseph, cugnot, is, often, credited, with, building, the, first, self, propelled, mechanical, vehicle, or, automobile, in, 1769, in, russia, in, the, 1780s, ivan, kulibin, developed, a, human, pedalled, three, wheeled, carriage, with, modern, features, such, as, a, flywheel, brake, gear, box, and, bearings, however, it, was, not, developed, further, in, 1783, the, montgolfier, brothers, developed, the, first, balloon, vehicle, in, 1801, richard, trevithick, built, and, demonstrated, his, puffing, devil, road, locomotive, which, many, believe, was, the, first, demonstration, of, a, steam, powered, road, vehicle, though, it, could, not, maintain, sufficient, steam, pressure, for, long, periods, and, was, of, little, practical, use, in, 1817, the, laufmaschine, running, machine, invented, by, the, german, baron, karl, von, drais, became, the, first, human, means, of, transport, to, make, use, of, the, two, wheeler, principle, it, is, regarded, as, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, bicycle, and, motorcycle, in, 1885, karl, benz, built, and, subsequently, patented, the, benz, patent, motorwagen, the, first, automobile, powered, by, his, own, four, stroke, cycle, gasoline, engine, in, 1885, otto, lilienthal, began, experimental, gliding, and, achieved, the, first, sustained, controlled, reproducible, flights, in, 1903, the, wright, brothers, flew, the, wright, flyer, the, first, controlled, powered, aircraft, in, kitty, hawk, north, carolina, in, 1907, gyroplane, no, i, became, the, first, tethered, rotorcraft, to, fly, the, same, year, the, cornu, helicopter, became, the, first, rotorcraft, to, achieve, free, flight, in, 1928, opel, initiated, the, opel, rak, program, the, first, large, scale, rocket, program, the, opel, rak, 1, became, the, first, rocket, car, the, following, year, it, also, became, the, first, rocket, powered, aircraft, in, 1961, the, soviet, space, program, s, vostok, 1, carried, yuri, gagarin, into, space, in, 1969, nasa, s, apollo, 11, achieved, the, first, moon, landing, in, 2010, the, number, of, motor, vehicles, in, operation, worldwide, surpassed, 1, billion, roughly, one, for, every, seven, people, there, are, over, 1, billion, bicycles, in, use, worldwide, in, 2002, there, were, an, estimated, 590, million, cars, and, 205, million, motorcycles, in, service, in, the, world, at, least, 500, million, chinese, flying, pigeon, bicycles, have, been, made, more, than, any, other, single, model, of, vehicle, the, most, produced, model, of, motor, vehicle, is, the, honda, super, cub, motorcycle, having, sold, 60, million, units, in, 2008, the, most, produced, car, model, is, the, toyota, corolla, with, at, least, 35, million, made, by, 2010, the, most, common, fixed, wing, airplane, is, the, cessna, 172, with, about, 44, 000, having, been, made, as, of, 2017, the, soviet, mil, mi, 8, at, 17, 000, is, the, most, produced, helicopter, the, top, commercial, jet, airliner, is, the, boeing, 737, at, about, 10, 000, in, 2018, at, around, 14, 000, for, both, the, most, produced, trams, are, the, ktm, 5, and, tatra, t3, the, most, common, trolleybus, is, ziu, 9, locomotion, consists, of, a, means, that, allows, displacement, with, little, opposition, a, power, source, to, provide, the, required, kinetic, energy, and, a, means, to, control, the, motion, such, as, a, brake, and, steering, system, by, far, most, vehicles, use, wheels, which, employ, the, principle, of, rolling, to, enable, displacement, with, very, little, rolling, friction, it, is, essential, that, a, vehicle, have, a, source, of, energy, to, drive, it, energy, can, be, extracted, from, external, sources, as, in, the, cases, of, a, sailboat, a, solar, powered, car, or, an, electric, streetcar, that, uses, overhead, lines, energy, can, also, be, stored, provided, it, can, be, converted, on, demand, and, the, storing, medium, s, energy, density, and, power, density, are, sufficient, to, meet, the, vehicle, s, needs, human, power, is, a, simple, source, of, energy, that, requires, nothing, more, than, humans, despite, the, fact, that, humans, cannot, exceed, 500, w, 0, 67, hp, for, meaningful, amounts, of, time, the, land, speed, record, for, human, powered, vehicles, unpaced, is, 133, km, h, 83, mph, as, of, 2009, on, a, recumbent, bicycle, the, energy, source, used, to, power, vehicles, is, fuel, external, combustion, engines, can, use, almost, anything, that, burns, as, fuel, whilst, internal, combustion, engines, and, rocket, engines, are, designed, to, burn, a, specific, fuel, typically, gasoline, diesel, or, ethanol, food, is, the, fuel, used, to, power, non, motor, vehicles, such, as, cycles, rickshaws, and, other, pedestrian, controlled, vehicles, another, common, medium, for, storing, energy, is, batteries, which, have, the, advantages, of, being, responsive, useful, in, a, wide, range, of, power, levels, environmentally, friendly, efficient, simple, to, install, and, easy, to, maintain, batteries, also, facilitate, the, use, of, electric, motors, which, have, their, own, advantages, on, the, other, hand, batteries, have, low, energy, densities, short, service, life, poor, performance, at, extreme, temperatures, long, charging, times, and, difficulties, with, disposal, although, they, can, usually, be, recycled, like, fuel, batteries, store, chemical, energy, and, can, cause, burns, and, poisoning, in, event, of, an, accident, batteries, also, lose, effectiveness, with, time, the, issue, of, charge, time, can, be, resolved, by, swapping, discharged, batteries, with, charged, ones, however, this, incurs, additional, hardware, costs, and, may, be, impractical, for, larger, batteries, moreover, there, must, be, standard, batteries, for, battery, swapping, to, work, at, a, gas, station, fuel, cells, are, similar, to, batteries, in, that, they, convert, from, chemical, to, electrical, energy, but, have, their, own, advantages, and, disadvantages, electrified, rails, and, overhead, cables, are, a, common, source, of, electrical, energy, on, subways, railways, trams, and, trolleybuses, solar, energy, is, a, more, modern, development, and, several, solar, vehicles, have, been, successfully, built, and, tested, including, helios, a, solar, powered, aircraft, nuclear, power, is, a, more, exclusive, form, of, energy, storage, currently, limited, to, large, ships, and, submarines, mostly, military, nuclear, energy, can, be, released, by, a, nuclear, reactor, nuclear, battery, or, repeatedly, detonating, nuclear, bombs, there, have, been, two, experiments, with, nuclear, powered, aircraft, the, tupolev, tu, 119, and, the, convair, x, 6, mechanical, strain, is, another, method, of, storing, energy, whereby, an, elastic, band, or, metal, spring, is, deformed, and, releases, energy, as, it, is, allowed, to, return, to, its, ground, state, systems, employing, elastic, materials, suffer, from, hysteresis, and, metal, springs, are, too, dense, to, be, useful, in, many, cases, flywheels, store, energy, in, a, spinning, mass, because, a, light, and, fast, rotor, is, energetically, favorable, flywheels, can, pose, a, significant, safety, hazard, moreover, flywheels, leak, energy, fairly, quickly, and, affect, a, vehicle, s, steering, through, the, gyroscopic, effect, they, have, been, used, experimentally, in, gyrobuses, wind, energy, is, used, by, sailboats, and, land, yachts, as, the, primary, source, of, energy, it, is, very, cheap, and, fairly, easy, to, use, the, main, issues, being, dependence, on, weather, and, upwind, performance, balloons, also, rely, on, the, wind, to, move, horizontally, aircraft, flying, in, the, jet, stream, may, get, a, boost, from, high, altitude, winds, compressed, gas, is, currently, an, experimental, method, of, storing, energy, in, this, case, compressed, gas, is, simply, stored, in, a, tank, and, released, when, necessary, like, elastics, they, have, hysteresis, losses, when, gas, heats, up, during, compression, gravitational, potential, energy, is, a, form, of, energy, used, in, gliders, skis, bobsleds, and, numerous, other, vehicles, that, go, down, hill, regenerative, braking, is, an, example, of, capturing, kinetic, energy, where, the, brakes, of, a, vehicle, are, augmented, with, a, generator, or, other, means, of, extracting, energy, when, needed, the, energy, is, taken, from, the, source, and, consumed, by, one, or, more, motors, or, engines, sometimes, there, is, an, intermediate, medium, such, as, the, batteries, of, a, diesel, submarine, most, motor, vehicles, have, internal, combustion, engines, they, are, fairly, cheap, easy, to, maintain, reliable, safe, and, small, since, these, engines, burn, fuel, they, have, long, ranges, but, pollute, the, environment, a, related, engine, is, the, external, combustion, engine, an, example, of, this, is, the, steam, engine, aside, from, fuel, steam, engines, also, need, water, making, them, impractical, for, some, purposes, steam, engines, also, need, time, to, warm, up, whereas, ic, engines, can, usually, run, right, after, being, started, although, this, may, not, be, recommended, in, cold, conditions, steam, engines, burning, coal, release, sulfur, into, the, air, causing, harmful, acid, rain, while, intermittent, internal, combustion, engines, were, once, the, primary, means, of, aircraft, propulsion, they, have, been, largely, superseded, by, continuous, internal, combustion, engines, such, as, gas, turbines, turbine, engines, are, light, and, particularly, when, used, on, aircraft, efficient, on, the, other, hand, they, cost, more, and, require, careful, maintenance, they, can, also, be, damaged, by, ingesting, foreign, objects, and, they, produce, a, hot, exhaust, trains, using, turbines, are, called, gas, turbine, electric, locomotives, examples, of, surface, vehicles, using, turbines, are, m1, abrams, mtt, turbine, superbike, and, the, millennium, pulse, jet, engines, are, similar, in, many, ways, to, turbojets, but, have, almost, no, moving, parts, for, this, reason, they, were, very, appealing, to, vehicle, designers, in, the, past, however, their, noise, heat, and, inefficiency, have, led, to, their, abandonment, a, historical, example, of, the, use, of, a, pulse, jet, was, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, pulse, jets, are, still, occasionally, used, in, amateur, experiments, with, the, advent, of, modern, technology, the, pulse, detonation, engine, has, become, practical, and, was, successfully, tested, on, a, rutan, varieze, while, the, pulse, detonation, engine, is, much, more, efficient, than, the, pulse, jet, and, even, turbine, engines, it, still, suffers, from, extreme, noise, and, vibration, levels, ramjets, also, have, few, moving, parts, but, they, only, work, at, high, speed, so, their, use, is, restricted, to, tip, jet, helicopters, and, high, speed, aircraft, such, as, the, lockheed, sr, 71, blackbird, rocket, engines, are, primarily, used, on, rockets, rocket, sleds, and, experimental, aircraft, rocket, engines, are, extremely, powerful, the, heaviest, vehicle, ever, to, leave, the, ground, the, saturn, v, rocket, was, powered, by, five, f, 1, rocket, engines, generating, a, combined, 180, million, horsepower, 134, 2, gigawatt, rocket, engines, also, have, no, need, to, push, off, anything, a, fact, that, the, new, york, times, denied, in, error, rocket, engines, can, be, particularly, simple, sometimes, consisting, of, nothing, more, than, a, catalyst, as, in, the, case, of, a, hydrogen, peroxide, rocket, this, makes, them, an, attractive, option, for, vehicles, such, as, jet, packs, despite, their, simplicity, rocket, engines, are, often, dangerous, and, susceptible, to, explosions, the, fuel, they, run, off, may, be, flammable, poisonous, corrosive, or, cryogenic, they, also, suffer, from, poor, efficiency, for, these, reasons, rocket, engines, are, only, used, when, absolutely, necessary, electric, motors, are, used, in, electric, vehicles, such, as, electric, bicycles, electric, scooters, small, boats, subways, trains, trolleybuses, trams, and, experimental, aircraft, electric, motors, can, be, very, efficient, over, 90, efficiency, is, common, electric, motors, can, also, be, built, to, be, powerful, reliable, low, maintenance, and, of, any, size, electric, motors, can, deliver, a, range, of, speeds, and, torques, without, necessarily, using, a, gearbox, although, it, may, be, more, economical, to, use, one, electric, motors, are, limited, in, their, use, chiefly, by, the, difficulty, of, supplying, electricity, compressed, gas, motors, have, been, used, on, some, vehicles, experimentally, they, are, simple, efficient, safe, cheap, reliable, and, operate, in, a, variety, of, conditions, one, of, the, difficulties, met, when, using, gas, motors, is, the, cooling, effect, of, expanding, gas, these, engines, are, limited, by, how, quickly, they, absorb, heat, from, their, surroundings, the, cooling, effect, can, however, double, as, air, conditioning, compressed, gas, motors, also, lose, effectiveness, with, falling, gas, pressure, ion, thrusters, are, used, on, some, satellites, and, spacecraft, they, are, only, effective, in, a, vacuum, which, limits, their, use, to, spaceborne, vehicles, ion, thrusters, run, primarily, off, electricity, but, they, also, need, a, propellant, such, as, caesium, or, more, recently, xenon, ion, thrusters, can, achieve, extremely, high, speeds, and, use, little, propellant, however, they, are, power, hungry, the, mechanical, energy, that, motors, and, engines, produce, must, be, converted, to, work, by, wheels, propellers, nozzles, or, similar, means, aside, from, converting, mechanical, energy, into, motion, wheels, allow, a, vehicle, to, roll, along, a, surface, and, with, the, exception, of, railed, vehicles, to, be, steered, wheels, are, ancient, technology, with, specimens, being, discovered, from, over, 5000, years, ago, wheels, are, used, in, a, plethora, of, vehicles, including, motor, vehicles, armoured, personnel, carriers, amphibious, vehicles, airplanes, trains, skateboards, and, wheelbarrows, nozzles, are, used, in, conjunction, with, almost, all, reaction, engines, vehicles, using, nozzles, include, jet, aircraft, rockets, and, personal, watercraft, while, most, nozzles, take, the, shape, of, a, cone, or, bell, some, unorthodox, designs, have, been, created, such, as, the, aerospike, some, nozzles, are, intangible, such, as, the, electromagnetic, field, nozzle, of, a, vectored, ion, thruster, continuous, track, is, sometimes, used, instead, of, wheels, to, power, land, vehicles, continuous, track, has, the, advantages, of, a, larger, contact, area, easy, repairs, on, small, damage, and, high, maneuverability, examples, of, vehicles, using, continuous, tracks, are, tanks, snowmobiles, and, excavators, two, continuous, tracks, used, together, allow, for, steering, the, largest, land, vehicle, in, the, world, the, bagger, 293, is, propelled, by, continuous, tracks, propellers, as, well, as, screws, fans, and, rotors, are, used, to, move, through, a, fluid, propellers, have, been, used, as, toys, since, ancient, times, however, it, was, leonardo, da, vinci, who, devised, what, was, one, of, the, earliest, propeller, driven, vehicles, the, aerial, screw, in, 1661, toogood, hays, adopted, the, screw, for, use, as, a, ship, propeller, since, then, the, propeller, has, been, tested, on, many, terrestrial, vehicles, including, the, schienenzeppelin, train, and, numerous, cars, in, modern, times, propellers, are, most, prevalent, on, watercraft, and, aircraft, as, well, as, some, amphibious, vehicles, such, as, hovercraft, and, ground, effect, vehicles, intuitively, propellers, cannot, work, in, space, as, there, is, no, working, fluid, however, some, sources, have, suggested, that, since, space, is, never, empty, a, propeller, could, be, made, to, work, in, space, similarly, to, propeller, vehicles, some, vehicles, use, wings, for, propulsion, sailboats, and, sailplanes, are, propelled, by, the, forward, component, of, lift, generated, by, their, sails, wings, ornithopters, also, produce, thrust, aerodynamically, ornithopters, with, large, rounded, leading, edges, produce, lift, by, leading, edge, suction, forces, research, at, the, university, of, toronto, institute, for, aerospace, studies, lead, to, a, flight, with, an, actual, ornithopter, on, july, 31, 2010, paddle, wheels, are, used, on, some, older, watercraft, and, their, reconstructions, these, ships, were, known, as, paddle, steamers, because, paddle, wheels, simply, push, against, the, water, their, design, and, construction, is, very, simple, the, oldest, such, ship, in, scheduled, service, is, the, skibladner, many, pedalo, boats, also, use, paddle, wheels, for, propulsion, screw, propelled, vehicles, are, propelled, by, auger, like, cylinders, fitted, with, helical, flanges, because, they, can, produce, thrust, on, both, land, and, water, they, are, commonly, used, on, all, terrain, vehicles, the, zil, 2906, was, a, soviet, designed, screw, propelled, vehicle, designed, to, retrieve, cosmonauts, from, the, siberian, wilderness, all, or, almost, all, of, the, useful, energy, produced, by, the, engine, is, usually, dissipated, as, friction, so, minimizing, frictional, losses, is, very, important, in, many, vehicles, the, main, sources, of, friction, are, rolling, friction, and, fluid, drag, air, drag, or, water, drag, wheels, have, low, bearing, friction, and, pneumatic, tires, give, low, rolling, friction, steel, wheels, on, steel, tracks, are, lower, still, aerodynamic, drag, can, be, reduced, by, streamlined, design, features, friction, is, desirable, and, important, in, supplying, traction, to, facilitate, motion, on, land, most, land, vehicles, rely, on, friction, for, accelerating, decelerating, and, changing, direction, sudden, reductions, in, traction, can, cause, loss, of, control, and, accidents, most, vehicles, with, the, notable, exception, of, railed, vehicles, have, at, least, one, steering, mechanism, wheeled, vehicles, steer, by, angling, their, front, or, rear, wheels, the, b, 52, stratofortress, has, a, special, arrangement, in, which, all, four, main, wheels, can, be, angled, skids, can, also, be, used, to, steer, by, angling, them, as, in, the, case, of, a, snowmobile, ships, boats, submarines, dirigibles, and, aeroplanes, usually, have, a, rudder, for, steering, on, an, airplane, ailerons, are, used, to, bank, the, airplane, for, directional, control, sometimes, assisted, by, the, rudder, with, no, power, applied, most, vehicles, come, to, a, stop, due, to, friction, but, it, is, often, required, to, stop, a, vehicle, faster, than, by, friction, alone, so, almost, all, vehicles, are, equipped, with, a, braking, system, wheeled, vehicles, are, typically, equipped, with, friction, brakes, which, use, the, friction, between, brake, pads, stators, and, brake, rotors, to, slow, the, vehicle, many, airplanes, have, high, performance, versions, of, the, same, system, in, their, landing, gear, for, use, on, the, ground, a, boeing, 757, brake, for, example, has, 3, stators, and, 4, rotors, the, space, shuttle, also, uses, frictional, brakes, on, its, wheels, as, well, as, frictional, brakes, hybrid, and, electric, cars, trolleybuses, and, electric, bicycles, can, also, use, regenerative, brakes, to, recycle, some, of, the, vehicle, s, potential, energy, high, speed, trains, sometimes, use, frictionless, eddy, current, brakes, however, widespread, application, of, the, technology, has, been, limited, by, overheating, and, interference, issues, aside, from, landing, gear, brakes, most, large, aircraft, have, other, ways, of, decelerating, in, aircraft, air, brakes, are, aerodynamic, surfaces, that, provide, braking, force, by, increasing, the, frontal, cross, section, thus, increasing, the, increasing, the, aerodynamic, drag, of, the, aircraft, these, are, usually, implemented, as, flaps, that, oppose, air, flow, when, extended, and, are, flush, with, the, aircraft, when, retracted, reverse, thrust, is, also, used, in, many, aeroplane, engines, propeller, aircraft, achieve, reverse, thrust, by, reversing, the, pitch, of, the, propellers, while, jet, aircraft, do, so, by, redirecting, their, engine, exhausts, forward, on, aircraft, carriers, arresting, gears, are, used, to, stop, an, aircraft, pilots, may, even, apply, full, forward, throttle, on, touchdown, in, case, the, arresting, gear, does, not, catch, and, a, go, around, is, needed, parachutes, are, used, to, slow, down, vehicles, travelling, very, fast, parachutes, have, been, used, in, land, air, and, space, vehicles, such, as, the, thrustssc, eurofighter, typhoon, and, apollo, command, module, some, older, soviet, passenger, jets, had, braking, parachutes, for, emergency, landings, boats, use, similar, devices, called, sea, anchors, to, maintain, stability, in, rough, seas, to, further, increase, the, rate, of, deceleration, or, where, the, brakes, have, failed, several, mechanisms, can, be, used, to, stop, a, vehicle, cars, and, rolling, stock, usually, have, hand, brakes, that, while, designed, to, secure, an, already, parked, vehicle, can, provide, limited, braking, should, the, primary, brakes, fail, a, secondary, procedure, called, forward, slip, is, sometimes, used, to, slow, airplanes, by, flying, at, an, angle, causing, more, drag, motor, vehicle, and, trailer, categories, are, defined, according, to, the, following, international, classification, in, the, european, union, the, classifications, for, vehicle, types, are, defined, by, european, community, is, based, on, the, community, s, wvta, whole, vehicle, type, approval, system, under, this, system, manufacturers, can, obtain, certification, for, a, vehicle, type, in, one, member, state, if, it, meets, the, ec, technical, requirements, and, then, market, it, eu, wide, with, no, need, for, further, tests, total, technical, harmonization, already, has, been, achieved, in, three, vehicle, categories, passenger, cars, motorcycles, and, tractors, and, soon, will, extend, to, other, vehicle, categories, coaches, and, utility, vehicles, it, is, essential, that, european, car, manufacturers, be, ensured, access, to, as, large, a, market, as, possible, while, the, community, type, approval, system, allows, manufacturers, to, fully, benefit, fully, from, internal, market, opportunities, worldwide, technical, harmonization, in, the, context, of, the, united, nations, economic, commission, for, europe, unece, offers, a, market, beyond, european, borders, in, many, cases, it, is, unlawful, to, operate, a, vehicle, without, a, license, or, certification, the, least, strict, form, of, regulation, usually, limits, what, passengers, the, driver, may, carry, or, prohibits, them, completely, e, g, a, canadian, ultralight, license, without, endorsements, the, next, level, of, licensing, may, allow, passengers, but, without, any, form, of, compensation, or, payment, a, private, driver, s, license, usually, has, these, conditions, commercial, licenses, that, allow, the, transport, of, passengers, and, cargo, are, more, tightly, regulated, the, most, strict, form, of, licensing, is, generally, reserved, for, school, buses, hazardous, materials, transports, and, emergency, vehicles, the, driver, of, a, motor, vehicle, is, typically, required, to, hold, a, valid, driver, s, license, while, driving, on, public, lands, whereas, the, pilot, of, an, aircraft, must, have, a, license,
