an, explosive, or, explosive, material, is, a, reactive, substance, that, contains, a, great, amount, of, potential, energy, that, can, produce, an, explosion, if, released, suddenly, usually, accompanied, by, the, production, of, light, heat, sound, and, pressure, an, explosive, charge, is, a, measured, quantity, of, explosive, material, which, may, either, be, composed, solely, of, one, ingredient, or, be, a, mixture, containing, at, least, two, substances, the, potential, energy, stored, in, an, explosive, material, may, for, example, be, explosive, materials, may, be, categorized, by, the, speed, at, which, they, expand, materials, that, detonate, the, front, of, the, chemical, reaction, moves, faster, through, the, material, than, the, speed, of, sound, are, said, to, be, high, explosives, and, materials, that, deflagrate, are, said, to, be, low, explosives, explosives, may, also, be, categorized, by, their, sensitivity, sensitive, materials, that, can, be, initiated, by, a, relatively, small, amount, of, heat, or, pressure, are, primary, explosives, and, materials, that, are, relatively, insensitive, are, secondary, or, tertiary, explosives, a, wide, variety, of, chemicals, can, explode, a, smaller, number, are, manufactured, specifically, for, the, purpose, of, being, used, as, explosives, the, remainder, are, too, dangerous, sensitive, toxic, expensive, unstable, or, prone, to, decomposition, or, degradation, over, short, time, spans, in, contrast, some, materials, are, merely, combustible, or, flammable, if, they, burn, without, exploding, the, distinction, however, is, not, very, clear, certain, materials, dusts, powders, gases, or, volatile, organic, liquids, may, be, simply, combustible, or, flammable, under, ordinary, conditions, but, become, explosive, in, specific, situations, or, forms, such, as, dispersed, airborne, clouds, or, confinement, or, sudden, release, early, thermal, weapons, such, as, greek, fire, have, existed, since, ancient, times, at, its, roots, the, history, of, chemical, explosives, lies, in, the, history, of, gunpowder, during, the, tang, dynasty, in, the, 9th, century, taoist, chinese, alchemists, were, eagerly, trying, to, find, the, elixir, of, immortality, in, the, process, they, stumbled, upon, the, explosive, invention, of, black, powder, made, from, coal, saltpeter, and, sulfur, in, 1044, gunpowder, was, the, first, form, of, chemical, explosives, and, by, 1161, the, chinese, were, using, explosives, for, the, first, time, in, warfare, the, chinese, would, incorporate, explosives, fired, from, bamboo, or, bronze, tubes, known, as, bamboo, firecrackers, the, chinese, also, inserted, live, rats, inside, the, bamboo, firecrackers, when, fired, toward, the, enemy, the, flaming, rats, created, great, psychological, ramifications, scaring, enemy, soldiers, away, and, causing, cavalry, units, to, go, wild, the, first, useful, explosive, stronger, than, black, powder, was, nitroglycerin, developed, in, 1847, since, nitroglycerin, is, a, liquid, and, highly, unstable, it, was, replaced, by, nitrocellulose, trinitrotoluene, tnt, in, 1863, smokeless, powder, dynamite, in, 1867, and, gelignite, the, latter, two, being, sophisticated, stabilized, preparations, of, nitroglycerin, rather, than, chemical, alternatives, both, invented, by, alfred, nobel, world, war, i, saw, the, adoption, of, tnt, in, artillery, shells, world, war, ii, saw, extensive, use, of, new, explosives, see, list, of, explosives, used, during, world, war, ii, in, turn, these, have, largely, been, replaced, by, more, powerful, explosives, such, as, c, 4, and, petn, however, c, 4, and, petn, react, with, metal, and, catch, fire, easily, yet, unlike, tnt, c, 4, and, petn, are, waterproof, and, malleable, the, largest, commercial, application, of, explosives, is, mining, whether, the, mine, is, on, the, surface, or, is, buried, underground, the, detonation, or, deflagration, of, either, a, high, or, low, explosive, in, a, confined, space, can, be, used, to, liberate, a, fairly, specific, sub, volume, of, a, brittle, material, rock, in, a, much, larger, volume, of, the, same, or, similar, material, the, mining, industry, tends, to, use, nitrate, based, explosives, such, as, emulsions, of, fuel, oil, and, ammonium, nitrate, solutions, mixtures, of, ammonium, nitrate, prills, fertilizer, pellets, and, fuel, oil, anfo, and, gelatinous, suspensions, or, slurries, of, ammonium, nitrate, and, combustible, fuels, in, materials, science, and, engineering, explosives, are, used, in, cladding, explosion, welding, a, thin, plate, of, some, material, is, placed, atop, a, thick, layer, of, a, different, material, both, layers, typically, of, metal, atop, the, thin, layer, is, placed, an, explosive, at, one, end, of, the, layer, of, explosive, the, explosion, is, initiated, the, two, metallic, layers, are, forced, together, at, high, speed, and, with, great, force, the, explosion, spreads, from, the, initiation, site, throughout, the, explosive, ideally, this, produces, a, metallurgical, bond, between, the, two, layers, as, the, length, of, time, the, shock, wave, spends, at, any, point, is, small, we, can, see, mixing, of, the, two, metals, and, their, surface, chemistries, through, some, fraction, of, the, depth, and, they, tend, to, be, mixed, in, some, way, it, is, possible, that, some, fraction, of, the, surface, material, from, either, layer, eventually, gets, ejected, when, the, end, of, material, is, reached, hence, the, mass, of, the, now, welded, bilayer, may, be, less, than, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, the, two, initial, layers, there, are, applications, where, a, shock, wave, and, electrostatics, can, result, in, high, velocity, projectiles, such, as, in, an, electrostatic, particle, accelerator, an, explosion, is, a, type, of, spontaneous, chemical, reaction, that, once, initiated, is, driven, by, both, a, large, exothermic, change, great, release, of, heat, and, a, large, positive, entropy, change, great, quantities, of, gases, are, released, in, going, from, reactants, to, products, thereby, constituting, a, thermodynamically, favorable, process, in, addition, to, one, that, propagates, very, rapidly, thus, explosives, are, substances, that, contain, a, large, amount, of, energy, stored, in, chemical, bonds, the, energetic, stability, of, the, gaseous, products, and, hence, their, generation, comes, from, the, formation, of, strongly, bonded, species, like, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, and, di, nitrogen, which, contain, strong, double, and, triple, bonds, having, bond, strengths, of, nearly, 1, mj, mole, consequently, most, commercial, explosives, are, organic, compounds, containing, no, 2, ono, 2, and, nhno, 2, groups, that, when, detonated, release, gases, like, the, aforementioned, e, g, nitroglycerin, tnt, hmx, petn, nitrocellulose, an, explosive, is, classified, as, a, low, or, high, explosive, according, to, its, rate, of, combustion, low, explosives, burn, rapidly, or, deflagrate, while, high, explosives, detonate, while, these, definitions, are, distinct, the, problem, of, precisely, measuring, rapid, decomposition, makes, practical, classification, of, explosives, difficult, for, a, reaction, to, be, classified, as, a, detonation, as, opposed, to, just, a, deflagration, the, propagation, of, the, reaction, shockwave, through, the, material, being, testing, must, be, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, through, that, material, the, speed, of, sound, through, a, liquid, or, solid, material, is, usually, orders, of, magnitude, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, through, air, or, other, gases, traditional, explosives, mechanics, is, based, on, the, shock, sensitive, rapid, oxidation, of, carbon, and, hydrogen, to, carbon, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, and, water, in, the, form, of, steam, nitrates, typically, provide, the, required, oxygen, to, burn, the, carbon, and, hydrogen, fuel, high, explosives, tend, to, have, the, oxygen, carbon, and, hydrogen, contained, in, one, organic, molecule, and, less, sensitive, explosives, like, anfo, are, combinations, of, fuel, carbon, and, hydrogen, fuel, oil, and, ammonium, nitrate, a, sensitizer, such, as, powdered, aluminum, may, be, added, to, an, explosive, to, increase, the, energy, of, the, detonation, once, detonated, the, nitrogen, portion, of, the, explosive, formulation, emerges, as, nitrogen, gas, and, toxic, nitric, oxides, the, chemical, decomposition, of, an, explosive, may, take, years, days, hours, or, a, fraction, of, a, second, the, slower, processes, of, decomposition, take, place, in, storage, and, are, of, interest, only, from, a, stability, standpoint, of, more, interest, are, the, other, two, rapid, forms, besides, decomposition, deflagration, and, detonation, in, deflagration, decomposition, of, the, explosive, material, is, propagated, by, a, flame, front, which, moves, slowly, through, the, explosive, material, at, speeds, less, than, the, speed, of, sound, within, the, substance, which, is, usually, higher, than, 340, m, s, or, 1240, km, h, in, most, liquid, or, solid, materials, in, contrast, to, detonation, which, occurs, at, speeds, greater, than, the, speed, of, sound, deflagration, is, a, characteristic, of, low, explosive, material, this, term, is, used, to, describe, an, explosive, phenomenon, whereby, the, decomposition, is, propagated, by, a, shock, wave, traversing, the, explosive, material, at, speeds, greater, than, the, speed, of, sound, within, the, substance, the, shock, front, is, capable, of, passing, through, the, high, explosive, material, at, supersonic, speeds, typically, thousands, of, metres, per, second, in, addition, to, chemical, explosives, there, are, a, number, of, more, exotic, explosive, materials, and, exotic, methods, of, causing, explosions, examples, include, nuclear, explosives, and, abruptly, heating, a, substance, to, a, plasma, state, with, a, high, intensity, laser, or, electric, arc, laser, and, arc, heating, are, used, in, laser, detonators, exploding, bridgewire, detonators, and, exploding, foil, initiators, where, a, shock, wave, and, then, detonation, in, conventional, chemical, explosive, material, is, created, by, laser, or, electric, arc, heating, laser, and, electric, energy, are, not, currently, used, in, practice, to, generate, most, of, the, required, energy, but, only, to, initiate, reactions, to, determine, the, suitability, of, an, explosive, substance, for, a, particular, use, its, physical, properties, must, first, be, known, the, usefulness, of, an, explosive, can, only, be, appreciated, when, the, properties, and, the, factors, affecting, them, are, fully, understood, some, of, the, more, important, characteristics, are, listed, below, sensitivity, refers, to, the, ease, with, which, an, explosive, can, be, ignited, or, detonated, i, e, the, amount, and, intensity, of, shock, friction, or, heat, that, is, required, when, the, term, sensitivity, is, used, care, must, be, taken, to, clarify, what, kind, of, sensitivity, is, under, discussion, the, relative, sensitivity, of, a, given, explosive, to, impact, may, vary, greatly, from, its, sensitivity, to, friction, or, heat, some, of, the, test, methods, used, to, determine, sensitivity, relate, to, specific, explosives, usually, but, not, always, highly, sensitive, on, one, or, more, of, the, three, above, axes, may, be, idiosyncratically, sensitive, to, such, factors, as, pressure, drop, acceleration, the, presence, of, sharp, edges, or, rough, surfaces, incompatible, materials, or, even, in, rare, cases, nuclear, or, electromagnetic, radiation, these, factors, present, special, hazards, that, may, rule, out, any, practical, utility, sensitivity, is, an, important, consideration, in, selecting, an, explosive, for, a, particular, purpose, the, explosive, in, an, armor, piercing, projectile, must, be, relatively, insensitive, or, the, shock, of, impact, would, cause, it, to, detonate, before, it, penetrated, to, the, point, desired, the, explosive, lenses, around, nuclear, charges, are, also, designed, to, be, highly, insensitive, to, minimize, the, risk, of, accidental, detonation, the, index, of, the, capacity, of, an, explosive, to, be, initiated, into, detonation, in, a, sustained, manner, it, is, defined, by, the, power, of, the, detonator, which, is, certain, to, prime, the, explosive, to, a, sustained, and, continuous, detonation, reference, is, made, to, the, sellier, bellot, scale, that, consists, of, a, series, of, 10, detonators, from, n, 1, to, n, 10, each, of, which, corresponds, to, an, increasing, charge, weight, in, practice, most, of, the, explosives, on, the, market, today, are, sensitive, to, an, n, 8, detonator, where, the, charge, corresponds, to, 2, grams, of, mercury, fulminate, the, velocity, with, which, the, reaction, process, propagates, in, the, mass, of, the, explosive, most, commercial, mining, explosives, have, detonation, velocities, ranging, from, 1800, m, s, to, 8000, m, s, today, velocity, of, detonation, can, be, measured, with, accuracy, together, with, density, it, is, an, important, element, influencing, the, yield, of, the, energy, transmitted, for, both, atmospheric, over, pressure, and, ground, acceleration, by, definition, a, low, explosive, such, as, black, powder, or, smokeless, gunpowder, has, a, burn, rate, of, 171, 631, m, s, in, contrast, a, high, explosive, whether, a, primary, such, as, detonating, cord, or, a, secondary, such, as, tnt, or, c, 4, has, a, significantly, higher, burn, rate, about, 6900, 8092, m, s, stability, is, the, ability, of, an, explosive, to, be, stored, without, deterioration, the, following, factors, affect, the, stability, of, an, explosive, the, term, power, or, performance, as, applied, to, an, explosive, refers, to, its, ability, to, do, work, in, practice, it, is, defined, as, the, explosive, s, ability, to, accomplish, what, is, intended, in, the, way, of, energy, delivery, i, e, fragment, projection, air, blast, high, velocity, jet, underwater, shock, and, bubble, energy, etc, explosive, power, or, performance, is, evaluated, by, a, tailored, series, of, tests, to, assess, the, material, for, its, intended, use, of, the, tests, listed, below, cylinder, expansion, and, air, blast, tests, are, common, to, most, testing, programs, and, the, others, support, specific, applications, in, addition, to, strength, explosives, display, a, second, characteristic, which, is, their, shattering, effect, or, brisance, from, the, french, meaning, to, break, which, is, distinguished, and, separate, from, their, total, work, capacity, this, characteristic, is, of, practical, importance, in, determining, the, effectiveness, of, an, explosion, in, fragmenting, shells, bomb, casings, grenades, and, the, like, the, rapidity, with, which, an, explosive, reaches, its, peak, pressure, power, is, a, measure, of, its, brisance, brisance, values, are, primarily, employed, in, france, and, russia, the, sand, crush, test, is, commonly, employed, to, determine, the, relative, brisance, in, comparison, to, tnt, no, test, is, capable, of, directly, comparing, the, explosive, properties, of, two, or, more, compounds, it, is, important, to, examine, the, data, from, several, such, tests, sand, crush, trauzl, and, so, forth, in, order, to, gauge, relative, brisance, true, values, for, comparison, require, field, experiments, density, of, loading, refers, to, the, mass, of, an, explosive, per, unit, volume, several, methods, of, loading, are, available, including, pellet, loading, cast, loading, and, press, loading, the, choice, being, determined, by, the, characteristics, of, the, explosive, dependent, upon, the, method, employed, an, average, density, of, the, loaded, charge, can, be, obtained, that, is, within, 80, 99, of, the, theoretical, maximum, density, of, the, explosive, high, load, density, can, reduce, sensitivity, by, making, the, mass, more, resistant, to, internal, friction, however, if, density, is, increased, to, the, extent, that, individual, crystals, are, crushed, the, explosive, may, become, more, sensitive, increased, load, density, also, permits, the, use, of, more, explosive, thereby, increasing, the, power, of, the, warhead, it, is, possible, to, compress, an, explosive, beyond, a, point, of, sensitivity, known, also, as, dead, pressing, in, which, the, material, is, no, longer, capable, of, being, reliably, initiated, if, at, all, volatility, is, the, readiness, with, which, a, substance, vaporizes, excessive, volatility, often, results, in, the, development, of, pressure, within, rounds, of, ammunition, and, separation, of, mixtures, into, their, constituents, volatility, affects, the, chemical, composition, of, the, explosive, such, that, a, marked, reduction, in, stability, may, occur, which, results, in, an, increase, in, the, danger, of, handling, the, introduction, of, water, into, an, explosive, is, highly, undesirable, since, it, reduces, the, sensitivity, strength, and, velocity, of, detonation, of, the, explosive, hygroscopicity, is, a, measure, of, a, material, s, moisture, absorbing, tendencies, moisture, affects, explosives, adversely, by, acting, as, an, inert, material, that, absorbs, heat, when, vaporized, and, by, acting, as, a, solvent, medium, that, can, cause, undesired, chemical, reactions, sensitivity, strength, and, velocity, of, detonation, are, reduced, by, inert, materials, that, reduce, the, continuity, of, the, explosive, mass, when, the, moisture, content, evaporates, during, detonation, cooling, occurs, which, reduces, the, temperature, of, reaction, stability, is, also, affected, by, the, presence, of, moisture, since, moisture, promotes, decomposition, of, the, explosive, and, in, addition, causes, corrosion, of, the, explosive, s, metal, container, explosives, considerably, differ, from, one, another, as, to, their, behavior, in, the, presence, of, water, gelatin, dynamites, containing, nitroglycerine, have, a, degree, of, water, resistance, explosives, based, on, ammonium, nitrate, have, little, or, no, water, resistance, as, ammonium, nitrate, is, highly, soluble, in, water, and, is, hygroscopic, many, explosives, are, toxic, to, some, extent, manufacturing, inputs, can, also, be, organic, compounds, or, hazardous, materials, that, require, special, handling, due, to, risks, such, as, carcinogens, the, decomposition, products, residual, solids, or, gases, of, some, explosives, can, be, toxic, whereas, others, are, harmless, such, as, carbon, dioxide, and, water, examples, of, harmful, by, products, are, green, explosives, seek, to, reduce, environment, and, health, impacts, an, example, of, such, is, the, lead, free, primary, explosive, copper, i, 5, nitrotetrazolate, an, alternative, to, lead, azide, explosive, material, may, be, incorporated, in, the, explosive, train, of, a, device, or, system, an, example, is, a, pyrotechnic, lead, igniting, a, booster, which, causes, the, main, charge, to, detonate, the, most, widely, used, explosives, are, condensed, liquids, or, solids, converted, to, gaseous, products, by, explosive, chemical, reactions, and, the, energy, released, by, those, reactions, the, gaseous, products, of, complete, reaction, are, typically, carbon, dioxide, steam, and, nitrogen, gaseous, volumes, computed, by, the, ideal, gas, law, tend, to, be, too, large, at, high, pressures, characteristic, of, explosions, ultimate, volume, expansion, may, be, estimated, at, three, orders, of, magnitude, or, one, liter, per, gram, of, explosive, explosives, with, an, oxygen, deficit, will, generate, soot, or, gases, like, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, which, may, react, with, surrounding, materials, such, as, atmospheric, oxygen, attempts, to, obtain, more, precise, volume, estimates, must, consider, the, possibility, of, such, side, reactions, condensation, of, steam, and, aqueous, solubility, of, gases, like, carbon, dioxide, oxygen, balance, is, an, expression, that, is, used, to, indicate, the, degree, to, which, an, explosive, can, be, oxidized, if, an, explosive, molecule, contains, just, enough, oxygen, to, convert, all, of, its, carbon, to, carbon, dioxide, all, of, its, hydrogen, to, water, and, all, of, its, metal, to, metal, oxide, with, no, excess, the, molecule, is, said, to, have, a, zero, oxygen, balance, the, molecule, is, said, to, have, a, positive, oxygen, balance, if, it, contains, more, oxygen, than, is, needed, and, a, negative, oxygen, balance, if, it, contains, less, oxygen, than, is, needed, the, sensitivity, strength, and, brisance, of, an, explosive, are, all, somewhat, dependent, upon, oxygen, balance, and, tend, to, approach, their, maxima, as, oxygen, balance, approaches, zero, a, chemical, explosive, may, consist, of, either, a, chemically, pure, compound, such, as, nitroglycerin, or, a, mixture, of, a, fuel, and, an, oxidizer, such, as, black, powder, or, grain, dust, and, air, some, chemical, compounds, are, unstable, in, that, when, shocked, they, react, possibly, to, the, point, of, detonation, each, molecule, of, the, compound, dissociates, into, two, or, more, new, molecules, generally, gases, with, the, release, of, energy, the, above, compositions, may, describe, most, of, the, explosive, material, but, a, practical, explosive, will, often, include, small, percentages, of, other, substances, for, example, dynamite, is, a, mixture, of, highly, sensitive, nitroglycerin, with, sawdust, powdered, silica, or, most, commonly, diatomaceous, earth, which, act, as, stabilizers, plastics, and, polymers, may, be, added, to, bind, powders, of, explosive, compounds, waxes, may, be, incorporated, to, make, them, safer, to, handle, aluminium, powder, may, be, introduced, to, increase, total, energy, and, blast, effects, explosive, compounds, are, also, often, alloyed, hmx, or, rdx, powders, may, be, mixed, typically, by, melt, casting, with, tnt, to, form, octol, or, cyclotol, an, oxidizer, is, a, pure, substance, molecule, that, in, a, chemical, reaction, can, contribute, some, atoms, of, one, or, more, oxidizing, elements, in, which, the, fuel, component, of, the, explosive, burns, on, the, simplest, level, the, oxidizer, may, itself, be, an, oxidizing, element, such, as, gaseous, or, liquid, oxygen, the, availability, and, cost, of, explosives, are, determined, by, the, availability, of, the, raw, materials, and, the, cost, complexity, and, safety, of, the, manufacturing, operations, a, primary, explosive, is, an, explosive, that, is, extremely, sensitive, to, stimuli, such, as, impact, friction, heat, static, electricity, or, electromagnetic, radiation, some, primary, explosives, are, also, known, as, contact, explosives, a, relatively, small, amount, of, energy, is, required, for, initiation, as, a, very, general, rule, primary, explosives, are, considered, to, be, those, compounds, that, are, more, sensitive, than, petn, as, a, practical, measure, primary, explosives, are, sufficiently, sensitive, that, they, can, be, reliably, initiated, with, a, blow, from, a, hammer, however, petn, can, also, usually, be, initiated, in, this, manner, so, this, is, only, a, very, broad, guideline, additionally, several, compounds, such, as, nitrogen, triiodide, are, so, sensitive, that, they, cannot, even, be, handled, without, detonating, nitrogen, triiodide, is, so, sensitive, that, it, can, be, reliably, detonated, by, exposure, to, alpha, radiation, it, s, is, the, only, explosive, for, which, this, is, true, primary, explosives, are, often, used, in, detonators, or, to, trigger, larger, charges, of, less, sensitive, secondary, explosives, primary, explosives, are, commonly, used, in, blasting, caps, and, percussion, caps, to, translate, a, physical, shock, signal, in, other, situations, different, signals, such, as, electrical, or, physical, shock, or, in, the, case, of, laser, detonation, systems, light, are, used, to, initiate, an, action, i, e, an, explosion, a, small, quantity, usually, milligrams, is, sufficient, to, initiate, a, larger, charge, of, explosive, that, is, usually, safer, to, handle, examples, of, primary, high, explosives, are, a, secondary, explosive, is, less, sensitive, than, a, primary, explosive, and, requires, substantially, more, energy, to, be, initiated, because, they, are, less, sensitive, they, are, usable, in, a, wider, variety, of, applications, and, are, safer, to, handle, and, store, secondary, explosives, are, used, in, larger, quantities, in, an, explosive, train, and, are, usually, initiated, by, a, smaller, quantity, of, a, primary, explosive, examples, of, secondary, explosives, include, tnt, and, rdx, tertiary, explosives, also, called, blasting, agents, are, so, insensitive, to, shock, that, they, cannot, be, reliably, detonated, by, practical, quantities, of, primary, explosive, and, instead, require, an, intermediate, explosive, booster, of, secondary, explosive, these, are, often, used, for, safety, and, the, typically, lower, costs, of, material, and, handling, the, largest, consumers, are, large, scale, mining, and, construction, operations, most, tertiaries, include, a, fuel, and, an, oxidizer, anfo, can, be, a, tertiary, explosive, if, its, reaction, rate, is, slow, low, explosives, or, low, order, explosives, are, compounds, wherein, the, rate, of, decomposition, proceeds, through, the, material, at, less, than, the, speed, of, sound, the, decomposition, is, propagated, by, a, flame, front, deflagration, which, travels, much, more, slowly, through, the, explosive, material, than, a, shock, wave, of, a, high, explosive, under, normal, conditions, low, explosives, undergo, deflagration, at, rates, that, vary, from, a, few, centimetres, per, second, to, approximately, 0, 4, kilometres, per, second, 1, 300, ft, s, it, is, possible, for, them, to, deflagrate, very, quickly, producing, an, effect, similar, to, a, detonation, this, can, happen, under, higher, pressure, such, as, when, gunpowder, deflagrates, inside, the, confined, space, of, a, bullet, casing, accelerating, the, bullet, to, well, beyond, the, speed, of, sound, or, temperature, a, low, explosive, is, usually, a, mixture, of, a, combustible, substance, and, an, oxidant, that, decomposes, rapidly, deflagration, however, they, burn, more, slowly, than, a, high, explosive, which, has, an, extremely, fast, burn, rate, low, explosives, are, normally, employed, as, propellants, included, in, this, group, are, petroleum, products, such, as, propane, and, gasoline, gunpowder, including, smokeless, powder, and, light, pyrotechnics, such, as, flares, and, fireworks, but, can, replace, high, explosives, in, certain, applications, including, in, gas, pressure, blasting, high, explosives, he, or, high, order,
