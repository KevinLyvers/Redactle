a, steamboat, is, a, boat, that, is, propelled, primarily, by, steam, power, typically, driving, propellers, or, paddlewheels, steamboats, sometimes, use, the, prefix, designation, ss, s, s, or, s, s, for, screw, steamer, or, ps, for, paddle, steamer, however, these, designations, are, most, often, used, for, steamships, the, term, steamboat, is, used, to, refer, to, smaller, insular, steam, powered, boats, working, on, lakes, and, rivers, particularly, riverboats, as, using, steam, became, more, reliable, steam, power, became, applied, to, larger, ocean, going, vessels, the, first, steamboat, designs, used, newcomen, steam, engines, these, engines, were, large, heavy, and, produced, little, power, which, resulted, in, an, unfavorable, power, to, weight, ratio, the, heavy, weight, of, the, newcomen, engine, required, a, structurally, strong, boat, and, the, reciprocating, motion, of, the, engine, beam, required, a, complicated, mechanism, to, produce, propulsion, james, watt, s, design, improvements, increased, the, efficiency, of, the, steam, engine, improving, the, power, to, weight, ratio, and, created, an, engine, capable, of, rotary, motion, by, using, a, double, acting, cylinder, which, injected, steam, at, each, end, of, the, piston, stroke, to, move, the, piston, back, and, forth, the, rotary, steam, engine, simplified, the, mechanism, required, to, turn, a, paddle, wheel, to, propel, a, boat, despite, the, improved, efficiency, and, rotary, motion, the, power, to, weight, ratio, of, boulton, and, watt, steam, engine, was, still, low, the, high, pressure, steam, engine, was, the, development, that, made, the, steamboat, practical, it, had, a, high, power, to, weight, ratio, and, was, fuel, efficient, high, pressure, engines, were, made, possible, by, improvements, in, the, design, of, boilers, and, engine, components, so, that, they, could, withstand, internal, pressure, although, boiler, explosions, were, common, due, to, lack, of, instrumentation, like, pressure, gauges, attempts, at, making, high, pressure, engines, had, to, wait, until, the, expiration, of, the, boulton, and, watt, patent, in, 1800, shortly, thereafter, high, pressure, engines, by, richard, trevithick, and, oliver, evans, were, introduced, the, compound, steam, engine, became, widespread, in, the, late, 19th, century, compounding, uses, exhaust, steam, from, a, high, pressure, cylinder, to, a, lower, pressure, cylinder, and, greatly, improves, efficiency, with, compound, engines, it, was, possible, for, trans, ocean, steamers, to, carry, less, coal, than, freight, compound, steam, engine, powered, ships, enabled, a, great, increase, in, international, trade, the, most, efficient, steam, engine, used, for, marine, propulsion, is, the, steam, turbine, it, was, developed, near, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, was, used, throughout, the, 20th, century, an, apocryphal, story, from, 1851, attributes, the, earliest, steamboat, to, denis, papin, for, a, boat, he, built, in, 1705, papin, was, an, early, innovator, in, steam, power, and, the, inventor, of, the, steam, digester, the, first, pressure, cooker, which, played, an, important, role, in, james, watt, s, steam, experiments, however, papin, s, boat, was, not, steam, powered, but, powered, by, hand, cranked, paddles, a, steamboat, was, described, and, patented, by, english, physician, john, allen, in, 1729, in, 1736, jonathan, hulls, was, granted, a, patent, in, england, for, a, newcomen, engine, powered, steamboat, using, a, pulley, instead, of, a, beam, and, a, pawl, and, ratchet, to, obtain, rotary, motion, but, it, was, the, improvement, in, steam, engines, by, james, watt, that, made, the, concept, feasible, william, henry, of, lancaster, pennsylvania, having, learned, of, watt, s, engine, on, a, visit, to, england, made, his, own, engine, and, put, it, in, a, boat, the, boat, sank, and, while, henry, made, an, improved, model, he, did, not, appear, to, have, much, success, though, he, may, have, inspired, others, the, first, steam, powered, ship, pyroscaphe, was, a, paddle, steamer, powered, by, a, double, acting, steam, engine, it, was, built, in, france, in, 1783, by, marquis, claude, de, jouffroy, and, his, colleagues, as, an, improvement, of, an, earlier, attempt, the, 1776, palmip, de, at, its, first, demonstration, on, 15, july, 1783, pyroscaphe, travelled, upstream, on, the, river, sa, ne, for, some, fifteen, minutes, before, the, engine, failed, presumably, this, was, easily, repaired, as, the, boat, is, said, to, have, made, several, such, journeys, following, this, de, jouffroy, attempted, to, get, the, government, interested, in, his, work, but, for, political, reasons, was, instructed, that, he, would, have, to, build, another, version, on, the, seine, in, paris, de, jouffroy, did, not, have, the, funds, for, this, and, following, the, events, of, the, french, revolution, work, on, the, project, was, discontinued, after, he, left, the, country, similar, boats, were, made, in, 1785, by, john, fitch, in, philadelphia, and, william, symington, in, dumfries, scotland, fitch, successfully, trialled, his, boat, in, 1787, and, in, 1788, he, began, operating, a, regular, commercial, service, along, the, delaware, river, between, philadelphia, and, burlington, new, jersey, carrying, as, many, as, 30, passengers, this, boat, could, typically, make, 7, to, 8, miles, per, hour, 11, to, 13, km, h, and, travelled, more, than, 2, 000, miles, 3, 200, km, during, its, short, length, of, service, the, fitch, steamboat, was, not, a, commercial, success, as, this, travel, route, was, adequately, covered, by, relatively, good, wagon, roads, the, following, year, a, second, boat, made, 30, mile, 48, km, excursions, and, in, 1790, a, third, boat, ran, a, series, of, trials, on, the, delaware, river, before, patent, disputes, dissuaded, fitch, from, continuing, meanwhile, patrick, miller, of, dalswinton, near, dumfries, scotland, had, developed, double, hulled, boats, propelled, by, manually, cranked, paddle, wheels, placed, between, the, hulls, even, attempting, to, interest, various, european, governments, in, a, giant, warship, version, 246, feet, 75, m, long, miller, sent, king, gustav, iii, of, sweden, an, actual, small, scale, version, 100, feet, 30, m, long, called, experiment, miller, then, engaged, engineer, william, symington, to, build, his, patent, steam, engine, that, drove, a, stern, mounted, paddle, wheel, in, a, boat, in, 1785, the, boat, was, successfully, tried, out, on, dalswinton, loch, in, 1788, and, was, followed, by, a, larger, steamboat, the, next, year, miller, then, abandoned, the, project, the, failed, project, of, patrick, miller, caught, the, attention, of, lord, dundas, governor, of, the, forth, and, clyde, canal, company, and, at, a, meeting, with, the, canal, company, s, directors, on, 5, june, 1800, they, approved, his, proposals, for, the, use, of, a, model, of, a, boat, by, captain, schank, to, be, worked, by, a, steam, engine, by, mr, symington, on, the, canal, the, boat, was, built, by, alexander, hart, at, grangemouth, to, symington, s, design, with, a, vertical, cylinder, engine, and, crosshead, transmitting, power, to, a, crank, driving, the, paddlewheels, trials, on, the, river, carron, in, june, 1801, were, successful, and, included, towing, sloops, from, the, river, forth, up, the, carron, and, thence, along, the, forth, and, clyde, canal, in, 1801, symington, patented, a, horizontal, steam, engine, directly, linked, to, a, crank, he, got, support, from, lord, dundas, to, build, a, second, steamboat, which, became, famous, as, the, charlotte, dundas, named, in, honour, of, lord, dundas, s, daughter, symington, designed, a, new, hull, around, his, powerful, horizontal, engine, with, the, crank, driving, a, large, paddle, wheel, in, a, central, upstand, in, the, hull, aimed, at, avoiding, damage, to, the, canal, banks, the, new, boat, was, 56, ft, 17, 1, m, long, 18, ft, 5, 5, m, wide, and, 8, ft, 2, 4, m, depth, with, a, wooden, hull, the, boat, was, built, by, john, allan, and, the, engine, by, the, carron, company, the, first, sailing, was, on, the, canal, in, glasgow, on, 4, january, 1803, with, lord, dundas, and, a, few, of, his, relatives, and, friends, on, board, the, crowd, were, pleased, with, what, they, saw, but, symington, wanted, to, make, improvements, and, another, more, ambitious, trial, was, made, on, 28, march, on, this, occasion, the, charlotte, dundas, towed, two, 70, ton, barges, 30, km, almost, 20, miles, along, the, forth, and, clyde, canal, to, glasgow, and, despite, a, strong, breeze, right, ahead, that, stopped, all, other, canal, boats, it, took, only, nine, and, a, quarter, hours, giving, an, average, speed, of, about, 3, km, h, 2, mph, the, charlotte, dundas, was, the, first, practical, steamboat, in, that, it, demonstrated, the, practicality, of, steam, power, for, ships, and, was, the, first, to, be, followed, by, continuous, development, of, steamboats, the, american, robert, fulton, was, present, at, the, trials, of, the, charlotte, dundas, and, was, intrigued, by, the, potential, of, the, steamboat, while, working, in, france, he, corresponded, with, and, was, helped, by, the, scottish, engineer, henry, bell, who, may, have, given, him, the, first, model, of, his, working, steamboat, fulton, designed, his, own, steamboat, which, sailed, along, the, river, seine, in, 1803, fulton, later, obtained, a, boulton, and, watt, steam, engine, shipped, to, america, where, his, first, proper, steamship, was, built, in, 1807, north, river, steamboat, later, known, as, clermont, which, carried, passengers, between, new, york, city, and, albany, new, york, clermont, was, able, to, make, the, 150, mile, 240, km, trip, in, 32, hours, the, steamboat, was, powered, by, a, boulton, and, watt, engine, and, was, capable, of, long, distance, travel, it, was, the, first, commercially, successful, steamboat, transporting, passengers, along, the, hudson, river, in, 1807, robert, l, stevens, began, operation, of, the, phoenix, which, used, a, high, pressure, engine, in, combination, with, a, low, pressure, condensing, engine, the, first, steamboats, powered, only, by, high, pressure, were, the, aetna, and, pennsylvania, designed, and, built, by, oliver, evans, in, october, 1811, a, ship, designed, by, john, stevens, little, juliana, would, operate, as, the, first, steam, powered, ferry, between, hoboken, and, new, york, city, stevens, ship, was, engineered, as, a, twin, screw, driven, steamboat, in, juxtaposition, to, clermont, s, boulton, and, watt, engine, the, design, was, a, modification, of, stevens, prior, paddle, steamer, phoenix, the, first, steamship, to, successfully, navigate, the, open, ocean, in, its, route, from, hoboken, to, philadelphia, in, 1812, henry, bell, s, ps, comet, was, inaugurated, the, steamboat, was, the, first, commercial, passenger, service, in, europe, and, sailed, along, the, river, clyde, in, scotland, the, margery, launched, in, dumbarton, in, 1814, in, january, 1815, became, the, first, steamboat, on, the, river, thames, much, to, the, amazement, of, londoners, she, operated, a, london, to, gravesend, river, service, until, 1816, when, she, was, sold, to, the, french, and, became, the, first, steamboat, to, cross, the, english, channel, when, she, reached, paris, the, new, owners, renamed, her, elise, and, inaugurated, a, seine, steamboat, service, in, 1818, ferdinando, i, the, first, italian, steamboat, left, the, port, of, naples, where, it, had, been, built, the, first, sea, going, steamboat, was, richard, wright, s, first, steamboat, experiment, an, ex, french, lugger, she, steamed, from, leeds, to, yarmouth, arriving, yarmouth, 19, july, 1813, tug, the, first, tugboat, was, launched, by, the, woods, brothers, port, glasgow, on, 5, november, 1817, in, the, summer, of, 1818, she, was, the, first, steamboat, to, travel, round, the, north, of, scotland, to, the, east, coast, steamships, required, carrying, fuel, coal, at, the, expense, of, the, regular, payload, for, this, reason, for, some, time, sailships, remained, more, economically, viable, for, long, voyages, however, as, the, steam, engine, technology, improved, more, power, could, be, generated, by, the, same, quantity, of, fuel, and, longer, distances, could, be, traveled, a, steamship, built, in, 1855, required, about, 40, of, its, available, cargo, space, to, store, enough, coal, to, cross, the, atlantic, but, by, the, 1860s, transatlantic, steamship, services, became, cost, effective, and, steamships, began, to, dominate, these, routes, by, the, 1870s, particularly, in, conjunction, with, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, south, asia, became, economically, accessible, for, steamships, from, europe, by, the, 1890s, the, steamship, technology, so, improved, that, steamships, became, economically, viable, even, on, long, distance, voyages, such, as, linking, great, britain, with, its, pacific, asian, colonies, such, as, singapore, and, hong, kong, this, resulted, in, the, downfall, of, sailing, the, era, of, the, steamboat, in, the, united, states, began, in, philadelphia, in, 1787, when, john, fitch, 1743, 1798, made, the, first, successful, trial, of, a, 45, foot, 14, meter, steamboat, on, the, delaware, river, on, 22, august, 1787, in, the, presence, of, members, of, the, united, states, constitutional, convention, fitch, later, 1790, built, a, larger, vessel, that, carried, passengers, and, freight, between, philadelphia, and, burlington, new, jersey, on, the, delaware, his, steamboat, was, not, a, financial, success, and, was, shut, down, after, a, few, months, service, however, this, marks, the, first, use, of, marine, steam, propulsion, in, scheduled, regular, passenger, transport, service, oliver, evans, 1755, 1819, was, a, philadelphian, inventor, born, in, newport, delaware, to, a, family, of, welsh, settlers, he, designed, an, improved, high, pressure, steam, engine, in, 1801, but, did, not, build, it, patented, 1804, the, philadelphia, board, of, health, was, concerned, with, the, problem, of, dredging, and, cleaning, the, city, s, dockyards, and, in, 1805, evans, convinced, them, to, contract, with, him, for, a, steam, powered, dredge, which, he, called, the, oruktor, amphibolos, it, was, built, but, was, only, marginally, successful, evans, s, high, pressure, steam, engine, had, a, much, higher, power, to, weight, ratio, making, it, practical, to, apply, it, in, locomotives, and, steamboats, evans, became, so, depressed, with, the, poor, protection, that, the, us, patent, law, gave, inventors, that, he, eventually, took, all, his, engineering, drawings, and, invention, ideas, and, destroyed, them, to, prevent, his, children, wasting, their, time, in, court, fighting, patent, infringements, robert, fulton, constructed, a, steamboat, to, ply, a, route, between, new, york, city, and, albany, new, york, on, the, hudson, river, he, successfully, obtained, a, monopoly, on, hudson, river, traffic, after, terminating, a, prior, 1797, agreement, with, john, stevens, who, owned, extensive, land, on, the, hudson, river, in, new, jersey, the, former, agreement, had, partitioned, northern, hudson, river, traffic, to, livingston, and, southern, to, stevens, agreeing, to, use, ships, designed, by, stevens, for, both, operations, with, their, new, monopoly, fulton, and, livingston, s, boat, named, the, clermont, after, livingston, s, estate, could, make, a, profit, the, clermont, was, nicknamed, fulton, s, folly, by, doubters, on, monday, 17, august, 1807, the, memorable, first, voyage, of, the, clermont, up, the, hudson, river, was, begun, she, traveled, the, 150, miles, 240, km, trip, to, albany, in, a, little, over, 32, hours, and, made, the, return, trip, in, about, eight, hours, the, use, of, steamboats, on, major, us, rivers, soon, followed, fulton, s, 1807, success, in, 1811, the, first, in, a, continuous, still, in, commercial, passenger, operation, as, of, 2007, line, of, river, steamboats, left, the, dock, at, pittsburgh, to, steam, down, the, ohio, river, to, the, mississippi, and, on, to, new, orleans, in, 1817, a, consortium, in, sackets, harbor, new, york, funded, the, construction, of, the, first, us, steamboat, ontario, to, run, on, lake, ontario, and, the, great, lakes, beginning, the, growth, of, lake, commercial, and, passenger, traffic, in, his, book, life, on, the, mississippi, river, pilot, and, author, mark, twain, described, much, of, the, operation, of, such, vessels, by, 1849, the, shipping, industry, was, in, transition, from, sail, powered, boats, to, steam, powered, boats, and, from, wood, construction, to, an, ever, increasing, metal, construction, there, were, basically, three, different, types, of, ships, being, used, standard, sailing, ships, of, several, different, types, clippers, and, paddle, steamers, with, paddles, mounted, on, the, side, or, rear, river, steamboats, typically, used, rear, mounted, paddles, and, had, flat, bottoms, and, shallow, hulls, designed, to, carry, large, loads, on, generally, smooth, and, occasionally, shallow, rivers, ocean, going, paddle, steamers, typically, used, side, wheeled, paddles, and, used, narrower, deeper, hulls, designed, to, travel, in, the, often, stormy, weather, encountered, at, sea, the, ship, hull, design, was, often, based, on, the, clipper, ship, design, with, extra, bracing, to, support, the, loads, and, strains, imposed, by, the, paddle, wheels, when, they, encountered, rough, water, the, first, paddle, steamer, to, make, a, long, ocean, voyage, was, the, 320, ton, 98, foot, long, 30, m, ss, savannah, built, in, 1819, expressly, for, packet, ship, mail, and, passenger, service, to, and, from, liverpool, england, on, 22, may, 1819, the, watch, on, the, savannah, sighted, ireland, after, 23, days, at, sea, the, allaire, iron, works, of, new, york, supplied, savannah, s, s, engine, cylinder, while, the, rest, of, the, engine, components, and, running, gear, were, manufactured, by, the, speedwell, ironworks, of, new, jersey, the, 90, horsepower, 67, kw, low, pressure, engine, was, of, the, inclined, direct, acting, type, with, a, single, 40, inch, diameter, 100, cm, cylinder, and, a, 5, foot, 1, 5, m, stroke, savannah, s, engine, and, machinery, were, unusually, large, for, their, time, the, ship, s, wrought, iron, paddlewheels, were, 16, feet, in, diameter, with, eight, buckets, per, wheel, for, fuel, the, vessel, carried, 75, short, tons, 68, t, of, coal, and, 25, cords, 91, m, 3, of, wood, the, ss, savannah, was, too, small, to, carry, much, fuel, and, the, engine, was, intended, only, for, use, in, calm, weather, and, to, get, in, and, out, of, harbors, under, favorable, winds, the, sails, alone, were, able, to, provide, a, speed, of, at, least, four, knots, the, savannah, was, judged, not, a, commercial, success, and, its, engine, was, removed, and, it, was, converted, back, to, a, regular, sailing, ship, by, 1848, steamboats, built, by, both, united, states, and, british, shipbuilders, were, already, in, use, for, mail, and, passenger, service, across, the, atlantic, ocean, a, 3, 000, miles, 4, 800, km, journey, since, paddle, steamers, typically, required, from, 5, to, 16, short, tons, 4, 5, to, 14, 5, t, of, coal, per, day, to, keep, their, engines, running, they, were, more, expensive, to, run, initially, nearly, all, seagoing, steamboats, were, equipped, with, mast, and, sails, to, supplement, the, steam, engine, power, and, provide, power, for, occasions, when, the, steam, engine, needed, repair, or, maintenance, these, steamships, typically, concentrated, on, high, value, cargo, mail, and, passengers, and, only, had, moderate, cargo, capabilities, because, of, their, required, loads, of, coal, the, typical, paddle, wheel, steamship, was, powered, by, a, coal, burning, engine, that, required, firemen, to, shovel, the, coal, to, the, burners, by, 1849, the, screw, propeller, had, been, invented, and, was, slowly, being, introduced, as, iron, increasingly, was, used, in, ship, construction, and, the, stress, introduced, by, propellers, could, be, compensated, for, as, the, 1800s, progressed, the, timber, and, lumber, needed, to, make, wooden, ships, got, ever, more, expensive, and, the, iron, plate, needed, for, iron, ship, construction, got, much, cheaper, as, the, massive, iron, works, at, merthyr, tydfil, wales, for, example, got, ever, more, efficient, the, propeller, put, a, lot, of, stress, on, the, rear, of, the, ships, and, would, not, see, widespread, use, till, the, conversion, from, wood, boats, to, iron, boats, was, complete, well, underway, by, 1860, by, the, 1840s, the, ocean, going, steam, ship, industry, was, well, established, as, the, cunard, line, and, others, demonstrated, the, last, sailing, frigate, of, the, us, navy, santee, had, been, launched, in, 1855, in, the, mid, 1840s, the, acquisition, of, oregon, and, california, opened, up, the, west, coast, to, american, steamboat, traffic, starting, in, 1848, congress, subsidized, the, pacific, mail, steamship, company, with, 199, 999, to, set, up, regular, packet, ship, mail, passenger, and, cargo, routes, in, the, pacific, ocean, this, regular, scheduled, route, went, from, panama, city, nicaragua, and, mexico, to, and, from, san, francisco, and, oregon, panama, city, was, the, pacific, terminus, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, trail, across, panama, the, atlantic, ocean, mail, contract, from, east, coast, cities, and, new, orleans, to, and, from, the, chagres, river, in, panama, was, won, by, the, united, states, mail, steamship, company, whose, first, paddle, wheel, steamship, the, ss, falcon, 1848, was, dispatched, on, 1, december, 1848, to, the, caribbean, atlantic, terminus, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, trail, the, chagres, river, the, ss, california, 1848, the, first, pacific, mail, steamship, company, paddle, wheel, steamship, left, new, york, city, on, 6, october, 1848, with, only, a, partial, load, of, her, about, 60, saloon, about, 300, fare, and, 150, steerage, about, 150, fare, passenger, capacity, only, a, few, were, going, all, the, way, to, california, her, crew, numbered, about, 36, men, she, left, new, york, well, before, confirmed, word, of, the, california, gold, rush, had, reached, the, east, coast, once, the, california, gold, rush, was, confirmed, by, president, james, polk, in, his, state, of, the, union, address, on, 5, december, 1848, people, started, rushing, to, panama, city, to, catch, the, ss, california, the, ss, california, picked, up, more, passengers, in, valparaiso, chile, and, panama, city, panama, and, showed, up, in, san, francisco, loaded, with, about, 400, passengers, twice, the, passengers, it, had, been, designed, for, on, 28, february, 1849, she, had, left, behind, about, another, 400, 600, potential, passengers, still, looking, for, passage, from, panama, city, the, ss, california, had, made, the, trip, from, panama, and, mexico, after, steaming, around, cape, horn, from, new, york, see, ss, california, 1848, the, trips, by, paddle, wheel, steamship, to, panama, and, nicaragua, from, new, york, philadelphia, boston, via, new, orleans, and, havana, were, about, 2, 600, miles, 4, 200, km, long, and, took, about, two, weeks, trips, across, the, isthmus, of, panama, or, nicaragua, typically, took, about, one, week, by, native, canoe, and, mule, back, the, 4, 000, miles, 6, 400, km, trip, to, or, from, san, francisco, to, panama, city, could, be, done, by, paddle, wheel, steamer, in, about, three, weeks, in, addition, to, this, travel, time, via, the, panama, route, typically, had, a, two, to, four, week, waiting, period, to, find, a, ship, going, from, panama, city, panama, to, san, francisco, before, 1850, it, was, not, before, 1850, that, enough, paddle, wheel, steamers, were, available, in,

carrying, miners, and, their, supplies, the, 125, miles, 201, km, trip, from, san, francisco, up, the, extensive, sacramento, san, joaquin, river, delta, to, stockton, california, marysville, california, sacramento, etc, to, get, about, 125, miles, 201, km, closer, to, the, gold, fields, steam, powered, tugboats, and, towboats, started, working, in, the, san, francisco, bay, soon, after, this, to, expedite, shipping, in, and, out, of, the, bay, as, the, passenger, mail, and, high, value, freight, business, to, and, from, california, boomed, more, and, more, paddle, steamers, were, brought, into, service, eleven, by, the, pacific, mail, steamship, company, alone, the, trip, to, and, from, california, via, panama, and, paddle, wheeled, steamers, could, be, done, if, there, were, no, waits, for, shipping, in, about, 40, days, over, 100, days, less, than, by, wagon, or, 160, days, less, than, a, trip, around, cape, horn, about, 20, 30, of, the, california, argonauts, are,

business, in, the, east, with, their, wives, family, and, or, sweethearts, most, used, the, panama, or, nicaragua, route, till, 1855, when, the, completion, of, the, panama, railroad, made, the, panama, route, much, easier, faster, and, more, reliable, between, 1849, and, 1869, when, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, was, completed, across, the, united, states, about, 800, 000, travelers, had, used, the, panama, route, most, of, the, roughly, 50, 000, 000, of, gold, found, each, year, in, california, were, shipped, east, via, the, panama, route, on, paddle, steamers, mule, trains, and, canoes, and, later, the, panama, railroad, across, panama, after, 1855, when, the, panama, railroad, was, completed, the, panama, route, was, by, far, the, quickest, and, easiest, way, to, get, to, or, from, california, from, the, east, coast, of, the, u, s, or, europe, most, california, bound, merchandise, still, used, the, slower, but, cheaper, cape, horn, sailing, ship, route, the, sinking, of, the, paddle, steamer, ss, central, america, the, ship, of, gold, in, a, hurricane, on, 12, september, 1857, and, the, loss, of, about, 2, million, in, california, gold, indirectly, led, to, the, panic, of, 1857, steamboat, traffic, including, passenger, and, freight, business, grew, exponentially, in, the, decades, before, the, civil, war, so, too, did, the, economic, and, human, losses, inflicted, by, snags, shoals, boiler, explosions, and, human, error, during, the, us, civil, war, the, battle, of, hampton, roads, often, referred, to, as, either, the, battle, of, the, monitor, and, merrimack, or, the, battle, of, ironclads, was, fought, over, two, days, with, steam, powered, ironclad, warships, 8, 9, march, 1862, the, battle, occurred, in, hampton, roads, a, roadstead, in, virginia, where, the, elizabeth, and, nansemond, rivers, meet, the, james, river, just, before, it, enters, chesapeake, bay, adjacent, to, the, city, of, norfolk, the, battle, was, a, part, of, the, effort, of, the, confederate, states, of, america, to, break, the, union, naval, blockade, which, had, cut, off, virginia, from, all, international, trade, the, civil, war, in, the, west, was, fought, to, control, major, rivers, especially, the, mississippi, and, tennessee, rivers, using, paddlewheelers, only, the, union, had, them, the, confederacy, captured, a, few, but, were, unable, to, use, them, the, battle, of, vicksburg, involved, monitors, and, ironclad, riverboats, the, uss, cairo, is, a, survivor, of, the, vicksburg, battle, trade, on, the, river, was, suspended, for, two, years, because, of, a, confederate, s, mississippi, blockade, before, the, union, victory, at, vicksburg, reopened, the, river, on, 4, july, 1863, the, triumph, of, eads, ironclads, and, farragut, s, seizure, of, new, orleans, secured, the, river, for, the, union, north, although, union, forces, gained, control, of, mississippi, river, tributaries, travel, there, was, still, subject, to, interdiction, by, the, confederates, the, ambush, of, the, steamboat, j, r, williams, which, was, carrying, supplies, from, fort, smith, to, fort, gibson, along, the, arkansas, river, on, 16, july, 1863, demonstrated, this, the, steamboat, was, destroyed, the, cargo, was, lost, and, the, tiny, union, escort, was, run, off, the, loss, did, not, affect, the, union, war, effort, however, the, worst, of, all, steamboat, accidents, occurred, at, the, end, of, the, civil, war, in, april, 1865, when, the, steamboat, sultana, carrying, an, over, capacity, load, of, returning, union, soldiers, recently, freed, from, a, confederate, prison, camp, blew, up, causing, more, than, 1, 700, deaths, for, most, of, the, 19th, century, and, part, of, the, early, 20th, century, trade, on, the, mississippi, river, was, dominated, by, paddle, wheel, steamboats, their, use, generated, rapid, development, of, economies, of, port, cities, the, exploitation, of, agricultural, and, commodity, products, which, could, be, more, easily, transported, to, markets, and, prosperity, along, the, major, rivers, their, success, led, to, penetration, deep, into, the, continent, where, anson, northup, in, 1859, became, first, steamer, to, cross, the, canada, us, border, on, the, red, river, they, would, also, be, involved, in, major, political, events, as, when, louis, riel, seized, international, at, fort, garry, or, gabriel, dumont, was, engaged, by, northcote, at, batoche, steamboats, were, held, in, such, high, esteem, that, they, could, become, state, symbols, the, steamboat, iowa, 1838,

sometimes, cut, remaining, large, trees, 100, 200, feet, 30, 61, m, or, more, back, from, the, banks, exacerbating, the, problems, in, the, 19th, century, the, flooding, of, the, mississippi, became, a, more, severe, problem, than, when, the, floodplain, was, filled, with, trees, and, brush, most, steamboats, were, destroyed, by, boiler, explosions, or, fires, and, many, sank, in, the, river, with, some, of, those, buried, in, silt, as, the, river, changed, course, from, 1811, to, 1899, 156, steamboats, were, lost, to, snags, or, rocks, between, st, louis, and, the, ohio, river, another,

sternwheelers, lived, on, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, simplicity, of, these, vessels, and, their, shallow, draft, made, them, indispensable, to, pioneer, communities, that, were, otherwise, virtually, cut, off, from, the, outside, world, because, of, their, shallow, flat, bottomed, construction, the, canadian, examples, of, the, western, river, sternwheeler, generally, needed, less, than, three, feet, of, water, to, float, in, they, could, nose, up, almost, anywhere, along, a, riverbank, to, pick, up, or, drop, off, passengers, and, freight, sternwheelers, would, also, prove, vital, to, the, construction, of, the, railroads, that, eventually, replaced, them, they, were, used, to, haul, supplies, track, and, other, materials, to, construction, camps, the, simple, versatile, locomotive, style, boilers, fitted, to, most, sternwheelers, after, about, the, 1860s, could, burn, coal, when, available, in, more, populated, areas, like, the, lakes, of, the, kootenays, and, the,

counterparts, on, the, mississippi, and, its, tributaries, and, the, vessels, on, the, rivers, of, california, idaho, oregon, washington, and, alaska, the, canadian, sternwheelers, tended, to, have, fairly, short, life, spans, the, hard, usage, they, were, subjected, to, and, inherent, flexibility, of, their, shallow, wooden, hulls, meant, that, relatively, few, of, them, had, careers, longer,
