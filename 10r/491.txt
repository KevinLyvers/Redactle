ammunition, is, the, material, fired, scattered, dropped, or, detonated, from, any, weapon, or, weapon, system, ammunition, is, both, expendable, weapons, e, g, bombs, missiles, grenades, land, mines, and, the, component, parts, of, other, weapons, that, create, the, effect, on, a, target, e, g, bullets, and, warheads, the, purpose, of, ammunition, is, to, project, a, force, against, a, selected, target, to, have, an, effect, usually, but, not, always, lethal, an, example, of, ammunition, is, the, firearm, cartridge, which, includes, all, components, required, to, deliver, the, weapon, effect, in, a, single, package, until, the, 20th, century, black, powder, was, the, most, common, propellant, used, but, has, now, been, replaced, in, nearly, all, cases, by, modern, compounds, ammunition, comes, in, a, great, range, of, sizes, and, types, and, is, often, designed, to, work, only, in, specific, weapons, systems, however, there, are, internationally, recognized, standards, for, certain, ammunition, types, e, g, 5, 56, 45mm, nato, that, enable, their, use, across, different, weapons, and, by, different, users, there, are, also, specific, types, of, ammunition, that, are, designed, to, have, a, specialized, effect, on, a, target, such, as, armor, piercing, shells, and, tracer, ammunition, used, only, in, certain, circumstances, ammunition, is, commonly, labeled, or, colored, in, a, specific, manner, to, assist, in, its, identification, and, to, prevent, the, wrong, ammunition, types, from, being, used, accidentally, or, inappropriately, the, term, ammunition, can, be, traced, back, to, the, mid, 17th, century, the, word, comes, from, the, french, la, munition, for, the, material, used, for, war, ammunition, and, munition, are, often, used, interchangeably, although, munition, now, usually, refers, to, the, actual, weapons, system, with, the, ammunition, required, to, operate, it, in, some, languages, other, than, english, ammunition, is, still, referred, to, as, munition, such, as, french, munitions, german, munition, italian, munizione, and, portuguese, muni, o, ammunition, design, has, evolved, throughout, history, as, different, weapons, have, been, developed, and, different, effects, required, historically, ammunition, was, of, relatively, simple, design, and, build, e, g, sling, shot, stones, hurled, by, catapults, but, as, weapon, designs, developed, e, g, rifling, and, became, more, refined, the, need, for, more, specialized, ammunition, increased, modern, ammunition, can, vary, significantly, in, quality, but, is, usually, manufactured, to, very, high, standards, for, example, ammunition, for, hunting, can, be, designed, to, expand, inside, a, target, maximizing, the, damage, inflicted, by, one, round, anti, personnel, shells, are, designed, to, fragment, into, many, pieces, and, can, affect, a, large, area, armor, piercing, rounds, are, specially, hardened, to, penetrate, armor, while, smoke, ammunition, covers, an, area, with, a, fog, that, screens, people, from, view, more, generic, ammunition, e, g, 5, 56, 45mm, nato, can, often, be, altered, slightly, to, give, it, a, more, specific, effect, e, g, tracer, incendiary, whilst, larger, explosive, rounds, can, be, altered, by, using, different, fuzes, the, components, of, ammunition, intended, for, rifles, and, munitions, may, be, divided, into, these, categories, the, term, fuze, refers, to, the, detonator, of, an, explosive, round, or, shell, the, spelling, is, different, in, british, english, and, american, english, fuse, fuze, respectively, and, they, are, unrelated, to, a, fuse, electrical, a, fuse, was, earlier, used, to, ignite, the, propellant, e, g, such, as, on, a, firework, until, the, advent, of, more, reliable, systems, such, as, the, primer, or, igniter, that, is, used, in, most, modern, ammunition, the, fuze, of, a, weapon, can, be, used, to, alter, how, the, ammunition, works, for, example, a, common, artillery, shell, fuze, can, be, set, to, point, detonation, detonation, when, it, hits, a, target, delay, detonate, after, it, has, hit, and, penetrated, a, target, time, delay, explode, a, specified, time, after, firing, or, impact, and, proximity, explode, above, or, next, to, a, target, without, hitting, it, such, as, for, airburst, effects, or, anti, aircraft, shells, these, allow, a, single, ammunition, type, to, be, altered, to, suit, the, situation, it, is, required, for, there, are, many, designs, of, a, fuze, ranging, from, simple, mechanical, to, complex, radar, and, barometric, systems, fuzes, are, usually, armed, by, the, acceleration, force, of, firing, the, projectile, and, usually, arm, several, meters, after, clearing, the, bore, of, the, weapon, this, helps, to, ensure, the, ammunition, is, safer, to, handle, when, loading, into, the, weapon, and, reduces, the, chance, of, the, detonator, firing, before, the, ammunition, has, cleared, the, weapon, the, propellant, is, the, component, of, ammunition, that, is, activated, inside, the, weapon, and, provides, the, kinetic, energy, required, to, move, the, projectile, from, the, weapon, to, the, target, before, the, use, of, gunpowder, this, energy, would, have, been, produced, mechanically, by, the, weapons, system, e, g, a, catapult, or, crossbow, in, modern, times, it, is, usually, a, form, of, chemical, energy, that, rapidly, burns, to, create, kinetic, force, and, an, appropriate, amount, of, chemical, propellant, is, packaged, with, each, round, of, ammunition, in, recent, years, compressed, gas, magnetic, energy, and, electrical, energy, have, been, used, as, propellants, until, the, 20th, century, gunpowder, was, the, most, common, propellant, in, ammunition, however, it, has, since, been, replaced, by, a, wide, range, of, fast, burning, compounds, that, are, more, reliable, and, efficient, the, propellant, charge, is, distinct, from, the, projectile, charge, which, is, activated, by, the, fuze, which, causes, the, ammunition, effect, e, g, the, exploding, of, an, artillery, round, the, cartridge, is, the, container, that, holds, the, projectile, and, propellant, not, all, ammunition, types, have, a, cartridge, case, in, its, place, a, wide, range, of, materials, can, be, used, to, contain, the, explosives, and, parts, with, some, large, weapons, the, ammunition, components, are, stored, separately, until, loaded, into, the, weapon, system, for, firing, with, small, arms, caseless, ammunition, can, reduce, the, weight, and, cost, of, ammunition, and, simplify, the, firing, process, for, increased, firing, rate, but, the, maturing, technology, has, functionality, issues, the, projectile, is, the, part, of, the, ammunition, that, leaves, the, weapon, and, has, the, effect, on, the, target, this, effect, is, usually, either, kinetic, e, g, as, with, a, standard, bullet, or, through, the, delivery, of, explosives, an, ammunition, dump, is, a, military, facility, for, the, storage, of, live, ammunition, and, explosives, that, will, be, distributed, and, used, at, a, later, date, such, a, storage, facility, is, extremely, hazardous, with, the, potential, for, accidents, when, unloading, packing, and, transferring, the, ammunition, in, the, event, of, a, fire, or, explosion, the, site, and, its, surrounding, area, is, immediately, evacuated, and, the, stored, ammunition, is, left, to, detonate, itself, completely, with, limited, attempts, at, firefighting, from, a, safe, distance, in, large, facilities, there, may, be, a, flooding, system, to, automatically, extinguish, a, fire, or, prevent, an, explosion, typically, an, ammunition, dump, will, have, a, large, buffer, zone, surrounding, it, to, avoid, casualties, in, the, event, of, an, accident, there, will, also, be, perimeter, security, measures, in, place, to, prevent, access, by, unauthorized, personnel, and, to, guard, against, the, potential, threat, from, enemy, forces, a, magazine, is, a, place, where, a, quantity, of, ammunition, or, other, explosive, material, is, stored, temporarily, prior, to, being, used, the, term, may, be, used, for, a, facility, where, large, quantities, of, ammunition, are, stored, although, this, would, normally, be, referred, to, as, an, ammunition, dump, magazines, are, typically, located, in, the, field, for, quick, access, when, engaging, the, enemy, the, ammunition, storage, area, on, a, warship, is, referred, to, as, the, ship, s, magazine, on, a, smaller, scale, magazine, is, also, the, name, given, to, the, ammunition, storage, and, feeding, device, of, a, repeating, firearm, gunpowder, must, be, stored, in, a, dry, place, stable, room, temperature, to, keep, it, usable, as, long, as, for, 10, years, it, is, also, recommended, to, avoid, hot, places, because, friction, or, heat, might, ignite, a, spark, and, cause, an, explosion, the, standard, weapon, of, a, modern, soldier, is, an, assault, rifle, which, like, other, small, arms, uses, cartridge, ammunition, in, a, size, specific, to, the, weapon, ammunition, is, carried, on, the, person, in, box, magazines, specific, to, the, weapon, ammunition, boxes, pouches, or, bandoliers, the, amount, of, ammunition, carried, is, dependent, on, the, strength, of, the, soldier, the, expected, action, required, and, the, ability, of, ammunition, to, move, forward, through, the, logistical, chain, to, replenish, the, supply, a, soldier, may, also, carry, a, smaller, amount, of, specialized, ammunition, for, heavier, weapons, such, as, machine, guns, and, mortars, spreading, the, burden, for, squad, weapons, over, many, people, too, little, ammunition, poses, a, threat, to, the, mission, while, too, much, limits, the, soldier, s, mobility, also, being, a, threat, to, the, mission, a, shell, is, a, payload, carrying, projectile, which, as, opposed, to, a, shot, contains, explosives, or, other, fillings, in, use, since, the, 19th, century, artillery, shells, are, ammunition, that, is, designed, to, be, fired, from, artillery, which, has, an, effect, over, long, distances, usually, indirectly, i, e, out, of, sight, of, the, target, there, are, many, different, types, of, artillery, ammunition, but, they, are, usually, high, explosive, and, designed, to, shatter, into, fragments, on, impact, to, maximize, damage, the, fuze, used, on, an, artillery, shell, can, alter, how, it, explodes, or, behaves, so, it, has, a, more, specialized, effect, common, types, of, artillery, ammunition, include, high, explosive, smoke, illumination, and, practice, rounds, some, artillery, rounds, are, designed, as, cluster, munitions, artillery, ammunition, will, almost, always, include, a, projectile, the, only, exception, being, demonstration, or, blank, rounds, fuze, and, propellant, of, some, form, when, a, cartridge, case, is, not, used, there, will, be, some, other, method, of, containing, the, propellant, bags, usually, a, breech, loading, weapon, see, breechloader, tank, ammunition, was, developed, in, wwi, as, tanks, first, appeared, on, the, battlefield, however, as, tank, on, tank, warfare, developed, including, the, development, of, anti, tank, warfare, artillery, more, specialized, forms, of, ammunition, were, developed, such, as, high, explosive, anti, tank, heat, warheads, and, armour, piercing, discarding, sabot, apds, including, armour, piercing, fin, stabilized, discarding, sabot, apfsds, rounds, the, development, of, shaped, charges, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, anti, tank, ammunition, design, now, common, in, both, tank, fired, ammunition, and, in, anti, tank, missiles, including, anti, tank, guided, missiles, naval, weapons, were, originally, the, same, as, many, land, based, weapons, but, the, ammunition, was, designed, for, specific, use, such, as, a, solid, shot, designed, to, hole, an, enemy, ship, and, chain, shot, to, cut, rigging, and, sails, modern, naval, engagements, have, occurred, over, far, longer, distances, than, historic, battles, so, as, ship, armor, has, increased, in, strength, and, thickness, the, ammunition, to, defeat, it, has, also, changed, naval, ammunition, is, now, designed, to, reach, very, high, velocities, to, improve, its, armor, piercing, abilities, and, may, have, specialized, fuzes, to, defeat, specific, types, of, vessels, however, due, to, the, extended, ranges, at, which, modern, naval, combat, may, occur, guided, missiles, have, largely, supplanted, guns, and, shells, with, every, successive, improvement, in, military, arms, a, corresponding, modification, has, occurred, in, the, method, of, supplying, ammunition, in, the, quantity, required, as, soon, as, projectiles, were, required, such, as, javelins, and, arrows, there, needed, to, be, a, method, of, replenishment, when, non, specialized, interchangeable, or, recoverable, ammunition, was, used, e, g, arrows, it, was, possible, to, pick, up, spent, arrows, both, friendly, and, enemy, and, reuse, them, however, with, the, advent, of, explosive, or, non, recoverable, ammunition, this, was, no, longer, possible, and, new, supplies, of, ammunition, would, be, needed, the, weight, of, ammunition, required, particularly, for, artillery, shells, can, be, considerable, causing, a, need, for, extra, time, to, replenish, supplies, in, modern, times, there, has, been, an, increase, in, the, standardization, of, many, ammunition, types, between, allies, e, g, the, nato, standardization, agreement, that, has, allowed, for, shared, ammunition, types, e, g, 5, 56, 45mm, nato, as, of, 2013, lead, based, ammunition, production, is, the, second, largest, annual, use, of, lead, in, the, us, accounting, for, over, 60, 000, metric, tons, consumed, in, 2012, in, contrast, to, the, closed, loop, nature, of, the, largest, annual, use, of, lead, i, e, for, lead, acid, batteries, nearly, all, of, which, are, at, the, end, of, their, lives, collected, and, recycled, into, new, lead, acid, batteries, the, lead, in, ammunition, ends, up, being, almost, entirely, dispersed, into, the, natural, environment, for, example, lead, bullets, that, miss, their, target, or, remain, in, a, carcass, or, body, that, was, never, retrieved, can, very, easily, enter, environmental, systems, and, become, toxic, to, wildlife, the, us, military, has, experimented, with, replacing, lead, with, copper, as, a, slug, in, their, green, bullets, which, reduces, the, dangers, posed, by, lead, in, the, environment, as, a, result, of, artillery, since, 2010, this, has, eliminated, over, 2000, tons, of, lead, in, waste, streams, hunters, are, also, encouraged, to, use, monolithic, bullets, which, exclude, any, lead, content, unexploded, ammunition, can, remain, active, for, a, very, long, time, and, poses, a, significant, threat, to, both, humans, and, the, environment
