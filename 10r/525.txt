a, naval, mine, is, a, self, contained, explosive, device, placed, in, water, to, damage, or, destroy, surface, ships, or, submarines, unlike, depth, charges, mines, are, deposited, and, left, to, wait, until, they, are, triggered, by, the, approach, of, or, contact, with, any, vessel, or, a, particular, vessel, type, akin, to, anti, infantry, or, anti, vehicle, mines, naval, mines, can, be, used, offensively, to, hamper, enemy, shipping, movements, or, lock, vessels, into, a, harbour, or, defensively, to, protect, friendly, vessels, and, create, safe, zones, mines, allow, the, minelaying, force, commander, to, concentrate, warships, or, defensive, assets, in, mine, free, areas, giving, the, adversary, three, choices, undertake, an, expensive, and, time, consuming, minesweeping, effort, accept, the, casualties, of, challenging, the, minefield, or, use, the, unmined, waters, where, the, greatest, concentration, of, enemy, firepower, will, be, encountered, although, international, law, requires, signatory, nations, to, declare, mined, areas, precise, locations, remain, secret, and, non, complying, individuals, might, not, disclose, minelaying, while, mines, threaten, only, those, who, choose, to, traverse, waters, that, may, be, mined, the, possibility, of, activating, a, mine, is, a, powerful, disincentive, to, shipping, in, the, absence, of, effective, measures, to, limit, each, mine, s, lifespan, the, hazard, to, shipping, can, remain, long, after, the, war, in, which, the, mines, were, laid, is, over, unless, detonated, by, a, parallel, time, fuze, at, the, end, of, their, useful, life, naval, mines, need, to, be, found, and, dismantled, after, the, end, of, hostilities, an, often, prolonged, costly, and, hazardous, task, modern, mines, containing, high, explosives, detonated, by, complex, electronic, fuze, mechanisms, are, much, more, effective, than, early, gunpowder, mines, requiring, physical, ignition, mines, may, be, placed, by, aircraft, ships, submarines, or, individual, swimmers, and, boatmen, minesweeping, is, the, practice, of, the, removal, of, explosive, naval, mines, usually, by, a, specially, designed, ship, called, a, minesweeper, using, various, measures, to, either, capture, or, detonate, the, mines, but, sometimes, also, with, an, aircraft, made, for, that, purpose, there, are, also, mines, that, release, a, homing, torpedo, rather, than, explode, themselves, mines, can, be, laid, in, many, ways, by, purpose, built, minelayers, refitted, ships, submarines, or, aircraft, and, even, by, dropping, them, into, a, harbour, by, hand, they, can, be, inexpensive, some, variants, can, cost, as, little, as, us, 2, 000, though, more, sophisticated, mines, can, cost, millions, of, dollars, be, equipped, with, several, kinds, of, sensors, and, deliver, a, warhead, by, rocket, or, torpedo, their, flexibility, and, cost, effectiveness, make, mines, attractive, to, the, less, powerful, belligerent, in, asymmetric, warfare, the, cost, of, producing, and, laying, a, mine, is, usually, between, 0, 5, and, 10, of, the, cost, of, removing, it, and, it, can, take, up, to, 200, times, as, long, to, clear, a, minefield, as, to, lay, it, parts, of, some, world, war, ii, naval, minefields, still, exist, because, they, are, too, extensive, and, expensive, to, clear, some, 1940s, era, mines, may, remain, dangerous, for, many, years, mines, have, been, employed, as, offensive, or, defensive, weapons, in, rivers, lakes, estuaries, seas, and, oceans, but, they, can, also, be, used, as, tools, of, psychological, warfare, offensive, mines, are, placed, in, enemy, waters, outside, harbours, and, across, important, shipping, routes, to, sink, both, merchant, and, military, vessels, defensive, minefields, safeguard, key, stretches, of, coast, from, enemy, ships, and, submarines, forcing, them, into, more, easily, defended, areas, or, keeping, them, away, from, sensitive, ones, shipowners, are, reluctant, to, send, their, ships, through, known, minefields, port, authorities, may, attempt, to, clear, a, mined, area, but, those, without, effective, minesweeping, equipment, may, cease, using, the, area, transit, of, a, mined, area, will, be, attempted, only, when, strategic, interests, outweigh, potential, losses, the, decision, makers, perception, of, the, minefield, is, a, critical, factor, minefields, designed, for, psychological, effect, are, usually, placed, on, trade, routes, to, stop, ships, from, reaching, an, enemy, nation, they, are, often, spread, thinly, to, create, an, impression, of, minefields, existing, across, large, areas, a, single, mine, inserted, strategically, on, a, shipping, route, can, stop, maritime, movements, for, days, while, the, entire, area, is, swept, a, mine, s, capability, to, sink, ships, makes, it, a, credible, threat, but, minefields, work, more, on, the, mind, than, on, ships, international, law, specifically, the, eighth, hague, convention, of, 1907, requires, nations, to, declare, when, they, mine, an, area, to, make, it, easier, for, civil, shipping, to, avoid, the, mines, the, warnings, do, not, have, to, be, specific, for, example, during, world, war, ii, britain, declared, simply, that, it, had, mined, the, english, channel, north, sea, and, french, coast, naval, mines, were, first, invented, by, chinese, innovators, of, imperial, china, and, were, described, in, thorough, detail, by, the, early, ming, dynasty, artillery, officer, jiao, yu, in, his, 14th, century, military, treatise, known, as, the, huolongjing, chinese, records, tell, of, naval, explosives, in, the, 16th, century, used, to, fight, against, japanese, pirates, wokou, this, kind, of, naval, mine, was, loaded, in, a, wooden, box, sealed, with, putty, general, qi, jiguang, made, several, timed, drifting, explosives, to, harass, japanese, pirate, ships, the, tiangong, kaiwu, the, exploitation, of, the, works, of, nature, treatise, written, by, song, yingxing, in, 1637, describes, naval, mines, with, a, ripcord, pulled, by, hidden, ambushers, located, on, the, nearby, shore, who, rotated, a, steel, wheel, flint, mechanism, to, produce, sparks, and, ignite, the, fuse, of, the, naval, mine, although, this, is, the, rotating, steel, wheel, s, first, use, in, naval, mines, jiao, yu, described, their, use, for, land, mines, in, the, 14th, century, the, first, plan, for, a, sea, mine, in, the, west, was, by, ralph, rabbards, who, presented, his, design, to, queen, elizabeth, i, of, england, in, 1574, the, dutch, inventor, cornelius, drebbel, was, employed, in, the, office, of, ordnance, by, king, charles, i, of, england, to, make, weapons, including, the, failed, floating, petard, weapons, of, this, type, were, apparently, tried, by, the, english, at, the, siege, of, la, rochelle, in, 1627, american, david, bushnell, developed, the, first, american, naval, mine, for, use, against, the, british, in, the, american, war, of, independence, it, was, a, watertight, keg, filled, with, gunpowder, that, was, floated, toward, the, enemy, detonated, by, a, sparking, mechanism, if, it, struck, a, ship, it, was, used, on, the, delaware, river, as, a, drift, mine, destroying, a, small, boat, near, its, intended, target, a, british, warship, the, 1804, raid, on, boulogne, made, extensive, use, of, explosive, devices, designed, by, inventor, robert, fulton, the, torpedo, catamaran, was, a, coffer, like, device, balanced, on, two, wooden, floats, and, steered, by, a, man, with, a, paddle, weighted, with, lead, so, as, to, ride, low, in, the, water, the, operator, was, further, disguised, by, wearing, dark, clothes, and, a, black, cap, his, task, was, to, approach, the, french, ship, hook, the, torpedo, to, the, anchor, cable, and, having, activated, the, device, by, removing, a, pin, remove, the, paddles, and, escape, before, the, torpedo, detonated, also, to, be, deployed, were, large, numbers, of, casks, filled, with, gunpowder, ballast, and, combustible, balls, they, would, float, in, on, the, tide, and, on, washing, up, against, an, enemy, s, hull, explode, also, included, in, the, force, were, several, fireships, carrying, 40, barrels, of, gunpowder, and, rigged, to, explode, by, a, clockwork, mechanism, in, 1812, russian, engineer, pavel, shilling, exploded, an, underwater, mine, using, an, electrical, circuit, in, 1842, samuel, colt, used, an, electric, detonator, to, destroy, a, moving, vessel, to, demonstrate, an, underwater, mine, of, his, own, design, to, the, united, states, navy, and, president, john, tyler, however, opposition, from, former, president, john, quincy, adams, scuttled, the, project, as, not, fair, and, honest, warfare, in, 1854, during, the, unsuccessful, attempt, of, the, anglo, french, 101, warships, fleet, to, seize, the, kronstadt, fortress, british, steamships, hms, merlin, 9, june, 1855, the, first, successful, mining, in, history, hms, vulture, and, hms, firefly, suffered, damage, due, to, the, underwater, explosions, of, russian, naval, mines, russian, naval, specialists, set, more, than, 1, 500, naval, mines, or, infernal, machines, designed, by, moritz, von, jacobi, and, by, immanuel, nobel, in, the, gulf, of, finland, during, the, crimean, war, of, 1853, 1856, the, mining, of, vulcan, led, to, the, world, s, first, minesweeping, operation, during, the, next, 72, hours, 33, mines, were, swept, the, jacobi, mine, was, designed, by, german, born, russian, engineer, jacobi, in, 1853, the, mine, was, tied, to, the, sea, bottom, by, an, anchor, a, cable, connected, it, to, a, galvanic, cell, which, powered, it, from, the, shore, the, power, of, its, explosive, charge, was, equal, to, 14, kg, 31, lb, of, black, powder, in, the, summer, of, 1853, the, production, of, the, mine, was, approved, by, the, committee, for, mines, of, the, ministry, of, war, of, the, russian, empire, in, 1854, 60, jacobi, mines, were, laid, in, the, vicinity, of, the, forts, pavel, and, alexander, kronstadt, to, deter, the, british, baltic, fleet, from, attacking, them, it, gradually, phased, out, its, direct, competitor, the, nobel, mine, on, the, insistence, of, admiral, fyodor, litke, the, nobel, mines, were, bought, from, swedish, industrialist, immanuel, nobel, who, had, entered, into, collusion, with, the, russian, head, of, navy, alexander, sergeyevich, menshikov, despite, their, high, cost, 100, russian, rubles, the, nobel, mines, proved, to, be, faulty, exploding, while, being, laid, failing, to, explode, or, detaching, from, their, wires, and, drifting, uncontrollably, at, least, 70, of, them, were, subsequently, disarmed, by, the, british, in, 1855, 301, more, jacobi, mines, were, laid, around, krostadt, and, lisy, nos, british, ships, did, not, dare, to, approach, them, in, the, 19th, century, mines, were, called, torpedoes, a, name, probably, conferred, by, robert, fulton, after, the, torpedo, fish, which, gives, powerful, electric, shocks, a, spar, torpedo, was, a, mine, attached, to, a, long, pole, and, detonated, when, the, ship, carrying, it, rammed, another, one, and, withdrew, a, safe, distance, the, submarine, h, l, hunley, used, one, to, sink, uss, housatonic, on, 17, february, 1864, a, harvey, torpedo, was, a, type, of, floating, mine, towed, alongside, a, ship, and, was, briefly, in, service, in, the, royal, navy, in, the, 1870s, other, torpedoes, were, attached, to, ships, or, propelled, themselves, one, such, weapon, called, the, whitehead, torpedo, after, its, inventor, caused, the, word, torpedo, to, apply, to, self, propelled, underwater, missiles, as, well, as, to, static, devices, these, mobile, devices, were, also, known, as, fish, torpedoes, the, american, civil, war, of, 1861, 1865, also, saw, the, successful, use, of, mines, the, first, ship, sunk, by, a, mine, uss, cairo, foundered, in, 1862, in, the, yazoo, river, rear, admiral, david, farragut, s, famous, apocryphal, command, during, the, battle, of, mobile, bay, in, 1864, damn, the, torpedoes, full, speed, ahead, refers, to, a, minefield, laid, at, mobile, alabama, after, 1865, the, united, states, adopted, the, mine, as, its, primary, weapon, for, coastal, defense, in, the, decade, following, 1868, major, henry, larcom, abbot, carried, out, a, lengthy, set, of, experiments, to, design, and, test, moored, mines, that, could, be, exploded, on, contact, or, be, detonated, at, will, as, enemy, shipping, passed, near, them, this, initial, development, of, mines, in, the, united, states, took, place, under, the, purview, of, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, which, trained, officers, and, men, in, their, use, at, the, engineer, school, of, application, at, willets, point, new, york, later, named, fort, totten, in, 1901, underwater, minefields, became, the, responsibility, of, the, us, army, s, artillery, corps, and, in, 1907, this, was, a, founding, responsibility, of, the, united, states, army, coast, artillery, corps, the, imperial, russian, navy, a, pioneer, in, mine, warfare, successfully, deployed, mines, against, the, ottoman, navy, during, both, the, crimean, war, and, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 1878, during, the, war, of, the, pacific, 1879, 1883, the, peruvian, navy, at, a, time, when, the, chilean, squadron, was, blockading, the, peruvian, ports, formed, a, brigade, of, torpedo, boats, under, the, command, of, the, frigate, captain, leopoldo, s, nchez, calder, n, and, the, peruvian, engineer, manuel, cuadros, who, perfected, the, naval, torpedo, or, mine, system, to, be, electrically, activated, when, the, cargo, weight, was, lifted, this, is, how, on, 3, july, 1880, in, front, of, the, port, of, callao, the, gunned, transport, loa, flies, when, capturing, a, sloop, mined, by, the, peruvians, a, similar, fate, occurred, with, the, gunboat, schooner, covadonga, in, front, of, the, port, of, chancay, on, 13, september, 1880, which, having, captured, and, checked, a, beautiful, boat, it, exploded, when, hoisting, it, on, its, side, during, the, battle, of, tamsui, 1884, in, the, keelung, campaign, of, the, sino, french, war, chinese, forces, in, taiwan, under, liu, mingchuan, took, measures, to, reinforce, tamsui, against, the, french, they, planted, nine, torpedo, mines, in, the, river, and, blocked, the, entrance, during, the, boxer, rebellion, imperial, chinese, forces, deployed, a, command, detonated, mine, field, at, the, mouth, of, the, hai, river, before, the, dagu, forts, to, prevent, the, western, allied, forces, from, sending, ships, to, attack, the, next, major, use, of, mines, was, during, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, two, mines, blew, up, when, the, petropavlovsk, struck, them, near, port, arthur, sending, the, holed, vessel, to, the, bottom, and, killing, the, fleet, commander, admiral, stepan, makarov, and, most, of, his, crew, in, the, process, the, toll, inflicted, by, mines, was, not, confined, to, the, russians, however, the, japanese, navy, lost, two, battleships, four, cruisers, two, destroyers, and, a, torpedo, boat, to, offensively, laid, mines, during, the, war, most, famously, on, 15, may, 1904, the, russian, minelayer, amur, planted, a, 50, mine, minefield, off, port, arthur, and, succeeded, in, sinking, the, japanese, battleships, hatsuse, and, yashima, following, the, end, of, the, russo, japanese, war, several, nations, attempted, to, have, mines, banned, as, weapons, of, war, at, the, hague, peace, conference, 1907, many, early, mines, were, fragile, and, dangerous, to, handle, as, they, contained, glass, containers, filled, with, nitroglycerin, or, mechanical, devices, that, activated, a, blast, upon, tipping, several, mine, laying, ships, were, destroyed, when, their, cargo, exploded, beginning, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, submarine, mines, played, a, major, role, in, the, defense, of, u, s, harbours, against, enemy, attacks, as, part, of, the, endicott, and, taft, programs, the, mines, employed, were, controlled, mines, anchored, to, the, bottoms, of, the, harbours, and, detonated, under, control, from, large, mine, casemates, onshore, during, world, war, i, mines, were, used, extensively, to, defend, coasts, coastal, shipping, ports, and, naval, bases, around, the, globe, the, germans, laid, mines, in, shipping, lanes, to, sink, merchant, and, naval, vessels, serving, britain, the, allies, targeted, the, german, u, boats, in, the, strait, of, dover, and, the, hebrides, in, an, attempt, to, seal, up, the, northern, exits, of, the, north, sea, the, allies, developed, the, north, sea, mine, barrage, during, a, period, of, five, months, from, june, 1918, almost, 70, 000, mines, were, laid, spanning, the, north, sea, s, northern, exits, the, total, number, of, mines, laid, in, the, north, sea, the, british, east, coast, straits, of, dover, and, heligoland, bight, is, estimated, at, 190, 000, and, the, total, number, during, the, whole, of, wwi, was, 235, 000, sea, mines, clearing, the, barrage, after, the, war, took, 82, ships, and, five, months, working, around, the, clock, it, was, also, during, world, war, i, that, the, british, hospital, ship, hmhs, britannic, became, the, largest, vessel, ever, sunk, by, a, naval, mine, the, britannic, was, the, sister, ship, of, the, rms, titanic, and, the, rms, olympic, during, world, war, ii, the, u, boat, fleet, which, dominated, much, of, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, was, small, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, and, much, of, the, early, action, by, german, forces, involved, mining, convoy, routes, and, ports, around, britain, german, submarines, also, operated, in, the, mediterranean, sea, in, the, caribbean, sea, and, along, the, u, s, coast, initially, contact, mines, requiring, a, ship, to, physically, strike, a, mine, to, detonate, it, were, employed, usually, tethered, at, the, end, of, a, cable, just, below, the, surface, of, the, water, contact, mines, usually, blew, a, hole, in, ships, hulls, by, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, most, nations, had, developed, mines, that, could, be, dropped, from, aircraft, some, of, which, floated, on, the, surface, making, it, possible, to, lay, them, in, enemy, harbours, the, use, of, dredging, and, nets, was, effective, against, this, type, of, mine, but, this, consumed, valuable, time, and, resources, and, required, harbours, to, be, closed, later, some, ships, survived, mine, blasts, limping, into, port, with, buckled, plates, and, broken, backs, this, appeared, to, be, due, to, a, new, type, of, mine, detecting, ships, by, their, proximity, to, the, mine, an, influence, mine, and, detonating, at, a, distance, causing, damage, with, the, shock, wave, of, the, explosion, ships, that, had, successfully, run, the, gantlet, of, the, atlantic, crossing, were, sometimes, destroyed, entering, freshly, cleared, british, harbours, more, shipping, was, being, lost, than, could, be, replaced, and, churchill, ordered, the, intact, recovery, of, one, of, these, new, mines, to, be, of, the, highest, priority, the, british, experienced, a, stroke, of, luck, in, november, 1939, when, a, german, mine, was, dropped, from, an, aircraft, onto, the, mudflats, off, shoeburyness, during, low, tide, additionally, the, land, belonged, to, the, army, and, a, base, with, men, and, workshops, was, at, hand, experts, were, dispatched, from, hms, vernon, to, investigate, the, mine, the, royal, navy, knew, that, mines, could, use, magnetic, sensors, britain, having, developed, magnetic, mines, in, world, war, i, so, everyone, removed, all, metal, including, their, buttons, and, made, tools, of, non, magnetic, brass, they, disarmed, the, mine, and, rushed, it, to, the, labs, at, hms, vernon, where, scientists, discovered, that, the, mine, had, a, magnetic, arming, mechanism, a, large, ferrous, object, passing, through, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, will, concentrate, the, field, through, it, due, to, its, magnetic, permeability, the, mine, s, detector, was, designed, to, trigger, as, a, ship, passed, over, when, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, was, concentrated, in, the, ship, and, away, from, the, mine, the, mine, detected, this, loss, of, the, magnetic, field, which, caused, it, to, detonate, the, mechanism, had, an, adjustable, sensitivity, calibrated, in, milligauss, from, this, data, known, methods, were, used, to, clear, these, mines, early, methods, included, the, use, of, large, electromagnets, dragged, behind, ships, or, below, low, flying, aircraft, a, number, of, older, bombers, like, the, vickers, wellington, were, used, for, this, both, of, these, methods, had, the, disadvantage, of, sweeping, only, a, small, strip, a, better, solution, was, found, in, the, double, l, sweep, using, electrical, cables, dragged, behind, ships, that, passed, large, pulses, of, current, through, the, seawater, this, created, a, large, magnetic, field, and, swept, the, entire, area, between, the, two, ships, the, older, methods, continued, to, be, used, in, smaller, areas, the, suez, canal, continued, to, be, swept, by, aircraft, for, instance, while, these, methods, were, useful, for, clearing, mines, from, local, ports, they, were, of, little, or, no, use, for, enemy, controlled, areas, these, were, typically, visited, by, warships, and, the, majority, of, the, fleet, then, underwent, a, massive, degaussing, process, where, their, hulls, had, a, slight, south, bias, induced, into, them, which, offset, the, concentration, effect, almost, to, zero, initially, major, warships, and, large, troopships, had, a, copper, degaussing, coil, fitted, around, the, perimeter, of, the, hull, energized, by, the, ship, s, electrical, system, whenever, in, suspected, magnetic, mined, waters, some, of, the, first, to, be, so, fitted, were, the, carrier, hms, ark, royal, and, the, liners, rms, queen, mary, and, rms, queen, elizabeth, it, was, a, photo, of, one, of, these, liners, in, new, york, harbour, showing, the, degaussing, coil, which, revealed, to, german, naval, intelligence, the, fact, that, the, british, were, using, degaussing, methods, to, combat, their, magnetic, mines, this, was, felt, to, be, impractical, for, smaller, warships, and, merchant, vessels, mainly, because, the, ships, lacked, the, generating, capacity, to, energise, such, a, coil, it, was, found, that, wiping, a, current, carrying, cable, up, and, down, a, ship, s, hull, temporarily, canceled, the, ships, magnetic, signature, sufficiently, to, nullify, the, threat, this, started, in, late, 1939, and, by, 1940, merchant, vessels, and, the, smaller, british, warships, were, largely, immune, for, a, few, months, at, a, time, until, they, once, again, built, up, a, field, the, cruiser, hms, belfast, is, just, one, example, of, a, ship, that, was, struck, by, a, magnetic, mine, during, this, time, on, 21, november, 1939, a, mine, broke, her, keel, which, damaged, her, engine, and, boiler, rooms, as, well, as, injuring, 46, men, one, later, died, from, his, injuries, she, was, towed, to, rosyth, for, repairs, incidents, like, this, resulted, in, many, of, the, boats, that, sailed, to, dunkirk, being, degaussed, in, a, marathon, four, day, effort, by, degaussing, stations, the, allies, and, germany, deployed, acoustic, mines, in, world, war, ii, against, which, even, wooden, hulled, ships, in, particular, minesweepers, remained, vulnerable, japan, developed, sonic, generators, to, sweep, these, the, gear, was, not, ready, by, war, s, end, the, primary, method, japan, used, was, small, air, delivered, bombs, this, was, profligate, and, ineffectual, used, against, acoustic, mines, at, penang, 200, bombs, were, needed, to, detonate, just, 13, mines, the, germans, developed, a, pressure, activated, mine, and, planned, to, deploy, it, as, well, but, they, saved, it, for, later, use, when, it, became, clear, the, british, had, defeated, the, magnetic, system, the, u, s, also, deployed, these, adding, counters, which, would, allow, a, variable, number, of, ships, to, pass, unharmed, before, detonating, this, made, them, a, great, deal, harder, to, sweep, mining, campaigns, could, have, devastating, consequences, the, u, s, effort, against, japan, for, instance, closed, major, ports, such, as, hiroshima, for, days, and, by, the, end, of, the, pacific, war, had, cut, the, amount, of, freight, passing, through, kobe, yokohama, by, 90, when, the, war, ended, more, than, 25, 000, u, s, laid, mines, were, still, in, place, and, the, navy, proved, unable, to, sweep, them, all, limiting, efforts, to, critical, areas, after, sweeping, for, almost, a, year, in, may, 1946, the, navy, abandoned, the, effort, with, 13, 000, mines, still, unswept, over, the, next, thirty, years, more, than, 500, minesweepers, of, a, variety, of, types, were, damaged, or, sunk, clearing, them, the, u, s, began, adding, delay, counters, to, their, magnetic, mines, in, june, 1945, since, world, war, ii, mines, have, damaged, 14, united, states, navy, ships, whereas, air, and, missile, attacks, have, damaged, four, during, the, korean, war, mines, laid, by, north, korean, forces, caused, 70, of, the, casualties, suffered, by, u, s, naval, vessels, and, caused, 4, sinkings, during, the, iran, iraq, war, from, 1980, to, 1988, the, belligerents, mined, several, areas, of, the, persian, gulf, and, nearby, waters, on, 24, july, 1987, the, supertanker, ss, bridgeton, was, mined, by, iran, near, farsi, island, on, 14, april, 1988, uss, samuel, b, roberts, struck, an, iranian, mine, in, the, central, persian, gulf, shipping, lane, wounding, 10, sailors, in, the, summer, of, 1984, magnetic, sea, mines, damaged, at, least, 19, ships, in, the, red, sea, the, u, s, concluded, libya, was, probably, responsible, for, the, minelaying, in, response, the, u, s, britain, france, and, three, other, nations, launched, operation, intense, look, a, minesweeping, operation, in, the, red, sea, involving, more, than, 46, ships, on, the, orders, of, the, reagan, administration, the, cia, mined, nicaragua, s, sandino, port, in, 1984, in, support, of, the, contras, a, soviet, tanker, was, among, the, ships, damaged, by, these, mines, in, 1986, in, the, case, of, nicaragua, v, united, states, the, international, court, of, justice, ruled, that, this, mining, was, a, violation, of, international, law, during, the, gulf, war, iraqi, naval, mines, severely, damaged, uss, princeton, and, uss, tripoli, when, the, war, concluded, eight, countries, conducted, clearance, operations, houthi, forces, in, the, yemeni, civil, war, have, made, frequent, use, of, naval, mines, laying, over, 150, in, the, red, sea, throughout, the, conflict, in, the, first, month, of, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, ukraine, accused, russia, of, deliberately, employing, drifting, mines, in, the, black, sea, area, around, the, same, time, turkish, and, romanian, military, diving, teams, were, involved, in, defusing, operations, when, stray, mines, were, spotted, near, the, coasts, of, these, countries, london, p, i, club, issued, a, warning, to, freight, ships, in, the, area, advising, them, to, maintain, lookouts, for, mines, and, pay, careful, attention, to, local, navigation, warnings, ukrainian, forces, have, mined, from, the, sea, of, azov, to, the, black, sea, which, banks, the, critical, city, of, odesa, naval, mines, may, be, classified, into, three, major, groups, contact, remote, and, influence, mines, the, earliest, mines, were, usually, of, this, type, they, are, still, used, today, as, they, are, extremely, low, cost, compared, to, any, other, anti, ship, weapon, and, are, effective, both, as, a, psychological, weapon, and, as, a, method, to, sink, enemy, ships, contact, mines, need, to, be, touched, by, the, target, before, they, detonate, limiting, the, damage, to, the, direct, effects, of, the, explosion, and, usually, affecting, only, the, vessel, that, triggers, them, early, mines, had, mechanical, mechanisms, to, detonate, them, but, these, were, superseded, in, the, 1870s, by, the, hertz, horn, or, chemical, horn, which, was, found, to, work, reliably, even, after, the, mine, had, been, in, the, sea, for, several, years, the, mine, s, upper, half, is, studded, with, hollow, lead, protuberances, each, containing, a, glass, vial, filled, with, sulfuric, acid, when, a, ship, s, hull, crushes, the, metal, horn, it, cracks, the, vial, inside, it, allowing, the, acid, to, run, down, a, tube, and, into, a, lead, acid, battery, which, until, then, contained, no, acid, electrolyte, this, energizes, the, battery, which, detonates, the, explosive, earlier, forms, of, the, detonator, employed, a, vial, of, sulfuric, acid, surrounded, by, a, mixture, of, potassium, perchlorate, and, sugar, when, the, vial, was, crushed, the, acid, ignited, the, perchlorate, sugar, mix, and, the, resulting, flame, ignited, the, gunpowder, charge, during, the, initial, period, of, world, war, i, the, royal, navy, used, contact, mines, in, the, english, channel, and, later, in, large, areas, of, the, north, sea, to, hinder, patrols, by, german, submarines, later, the, american, antenna, mine, was, widely, used, because, submarines, could, be, at, any, depth, from, the, surface, to, the, seabed, this, type, of, mine, had, a, copper, wire, attached, to, a, buoy, that, floated, above, the, explosive, charge, which, was, weighted, to, the, seabed, with, a, steel, cable, if, a, submarine, s, steel, hull, touched, the, copper, wire, the, slight, voltage, change, caused, by, contact, between, two, dissimilar, metals, was, amplified, and, detonated, the, explosives, limpet, mines, are, a, special, form, of, contact, mine, that, are, manually, attached, to, the, target, by, magnets, and, remain, in, place, they, are, named, because, of, the, similarity, to, the, limpet, a, mollusk, generally, this, type, of, mine, is, set, to, float, just, below, the, surface, of, the, water, or, as, deep, as, five, meters, a, steel, cable, connecting, the, mine, to, an, anchor, on, the, seabed, prevents, it, from, drifting, away, the, explosive, and, detonating, mechanism, is, contained, in, a, buoyant, metal, or, plastic, shell, the, depth, below, the, surface, at, which, the, mine, floats, can, be, set, so, that, only, deep, draft, vessels, such, as, aircraft, carriers, battleships, or, large, cargo, ships, are, at, risk, saving, the, mine, from, being, used, on, a, less, valuable, target, in, littoral, waters, it, is, important, to, ensure, that, the, mine, does, not, become, visible, when, the, sea, level, falls, at, low, tide, so, the, cable, length, is, adjusted, to, take, account, of, tides, during, wwii, there, were, mines, that, could, be, moored, in, 300, m, 980, ft, deep, water, floating, mines, typically, have, a, mass, of, around, 200, kg, 440, lb, including, 80, kg, 180, lb, of, explosives, e, g, tnt, minol, or, amatol, a, special, form, of, moored, contact, mines, are, those, equipped, with, a, plummet, when, the, mine, is, launched, 1, the, mine, with, the, anchor, floats, first, and, the, lead, plummet, sinks, from, it, 2, in, doing, so, the, plummet, unwinds, a, wire, the, deep, line, which, is, used, to, set, the, depth, of, the, mine, below, the, water, surface, before, it, is, launched, 3, when, the, deep, line, has, been, unwound, to, a, set, length, the, anchor, is, flooded, and, the, mine, is, released, from, the, anchor, 4, the, anchor, begins, to, sink, and, the, mooring, cable, unwinds, until, the, plummet, reaches, the, sea, floor, 5, triggered, by, the, decreasing, tension, on, the, deep, line, the, mooring, cable, is, clamped, the, anchor, continues, sinking, down, to, the, bottom, of, the, sea, pulling, the, mine, below, the, water, surface, to, a, depth, equal, to, the, length, of, the, deep, line, 6, thus, even, without, knowing, the, exact, seafloor, depth, an, exact, depth, of, the, mine, below, the, water, surface, can, be, set, limited, only, by, the, maximum, length, of, the, mooring, cable, drifting, mines, were, occasionally, used, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, however, they, were, more, feared, than, effective, sometimes, floating, mines, break, from, their, moorings, and, become, drifting, mines, modern, mines, are, designed, to, deactivate, in, this, event, after, several, years, at, sea, the, deactivation, mechanism, might, not, function, as, intended, and, the, mines, may, remain, live, admiral, jellicoe, s, british, fleet, did, not, pursue, and, destroy, the, outnumbered, german, high, seas, fleet, when, it, turned, away, at, the, battle, of, jutland, because, he, thought, they, were, leading, him, into, a, trap, he, believed, it, possible, that, the, germans, were, either, leaving, floating, mines, in, their, wake, or, were, drawing, him, towards, submarines, although, neither, of, these, was, the, case, after, world, war, i, the, drifting, contact, mine, was, banned, but, was, occasionally, used, during, world, war, ii, the, drifting, mines, were, much, harder, to, remove, than, tethered, mines, after, the, war, and, they, caused, about, the, same, damage, to, both, sides, churchill, promoted, operation, royal, marine, in, 1940, and, again, in, 1944, where, floating, mines, were, put, into, the, rhine, in, france, to, float, down, the, river, becoming, active, after, a, time, calculated, to, be, long, enough, to, reach, german, territory, frequently, used, in, combination, with, coastal, artillery, and, hydrophones, controlled, mines, or, command, detonation, mines, can, be, in, place, in, peacetime, which, is, a, huge, advantage, in, blocking, important, shipping, routes, the, mines, can, usually, be, turned, into, normal, mines, with, a, switch, which, prevents, the, enemy, from, simply, capturing, the, controlling, station, and, deactivating, the, mines, detonated, on, a, signal, or, be, allowed, to, detonate, on, their, own, the, earliest, ones, were, developed, around, 1812, by, robert, fulton, the, first, remotely, controlled, mines, were, moored, mines, used, in, the, american, civil, war, detonated, electrically, from, shore, they, were, considered, superior, to, contact, mines, because, they, did, not, put, friendly, shipping, at, risk, the, extensive, american, fortifications, program, initiated, by, the, board, of, fortifications, in, 1885, included, remotely, controlled, mines, which, were, emplaced, or, in, reserve, from, the, 1890s, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, modern, examples, usually, weigh, 200, kg, 440, lb, including, 80, kg, 180, lb, of, explosives, tnt, or, torpex, these, mines, are, triggered, by, the, influence, of, a, ship, or, submarine, rather, than, direct, contact, such, mines, incorporate, electronic, sensors, designed, to, detect, the, presence, of, a, vessel, and, detonate, when, it, comes, within, the, blast, range, of, the, warhead, the, fuses, on, such, mines, may, incorporate, one, or, more, of, the, following, sensors, magnetic, passive, acoustic, or, water, pressure, displacement, caused, by, the, proximity, of, a, vessel, first, used, during, wwi, their, use, became, more, general, in, wwii, the, sophistication, of, influence, mine, fuses, has, increased, considerably, over, the, years, as, first, transistors, and, then, microprocessors, have, been, incorporated, into, designs, simple, magnetic, sensors, have, been, superseded, by, total, field, magnetometers, whereas, early, magnetic, mine, fuses, would, respond, only, to, changes, in, a, single, component, of, a, target, vessel, s, magnetic, field, a, total, field, magnetometer, responds, to, changes, in, the, magnitude, of, the, total, background, field, thus, enabling, it, to, better, detect, even, degaussed, ships, similarly, the, original, broadband, hydrophones, of, 1940s, acoustic, mines, which, operate, on, the, integrated, volume, of, all, frequencies, have, been, replaced, by, narrow, band, sensors, which, are, much, more, sensitive, and, selective, mines, can, now, be, programmed, to, listen, for, highly, specific, acoustic, signatures, e, g, a, gas, turbine, powerplant, or, cavitation, sounds, from, a, particular, design, of, propeller, and, ignore, all, others, the, sophistication, of, modern, electronic, mine, fuzes, incorporating, these, digital, signal, processing, capabilities, makes, it, much, more, difficult, to, detonate, the, mine, with, electronic, countermeasures, because, several, sensors, working, together, e, g, magnetic, passive, acoustic, and, water, pressure, allow, it, to, ignore, signals, which, are, not, recognised, as, being, the, unique, signature, of, an, intended, target, vessel, modern, influence, mines, such, as, the, bae, stonefish, are, computerised, with, all, the, programmability, this, implies, such, as, the, ability, to, quickly, load, new, acoustic, signatures, into, fuses, or, program, them, to, detect, a, single, highly, distinctive, target, signature, in, this, way, a, mine, with, a, passive, acoustic, fuze, can, be, programmed, to, ignore, all, friendly, vessels, and, small, enemy, vessels, only, detonating, when, a, very, large, enemy, target, passes, over, it, alternatively, the, mine, can, be, programmed, specifically, to, ignore, all, surface, vessels, regardless, of, size, and, exclusively, target, submarines, even, as, far, back, as, wwii, it, was, possible, to, incorporate, a, ship, counter, function, in, mine, fuzes, this, might, set, the, mine, to, ignore, the, first, two, ships, passing, over, it, which, could, be, minesweepers, deliberately, trying, to, trigger, mines, but, detonate, when, the, third, ship, passes, overhead, which, could, be, a, high, value, target, such, as, an, aircraft, carrier, or, oil, tanker, even, though, modern, mines, are, generally, powered, by, a, long, life, lithium, battery, it, is, important, to, conserve, power, because, they, may, need, to, remain, active, for, months, or, even, years, for, this, reason, most, influence, mines, are, designed, to, remain, in, a, semi, dormant, state, until, an, unpowered, e, g, deflection, of, a, mu, metal, needle, or, low, powered, sensor, detects, the, possible, presence, of, a, vessel, at, which, point, the, mine, fuze, powers, up, fully, and, the, passive, acoustic, sensors, will, begin, to, operate, for, some, minutes, it, is, possible, to, program, computerised, mines, to, delay, activation, for, days, or, weeks, after, being, laid, similarly, they, can, be, programmed, to, self, destruct, or, render, themselves, safe, after, a, preset, period, of, time, generally, the, more, sophisticated, the, mine, design, the, more, likely, it, is, to, have, some, form, of, anti, handling, device, to, hinder, clearance, by, divers, or, remotely, piloted, submersibles, the, moored, mine, is, the, backbone, of, modern, mine, systems, they, are, deployed, where, water, is, too, deep, for, bottom, mines, they, can, use, several, kinds, of, instruments, to, detect, an, enemy, usually, a, combination, of, acoustic, magnetic, and, pressure, sensors, or, more, sophisticated, optical, shadows, or, electro, potential, sensors, these, cost, many, times, more, than, contact, mines, moored, mines, are, effective, against, most, kinds, of, ships, as, they, are, cheaper, than, other, anti, ship, weapons, they, can, be, deployed, in, large, numbers, making, them, useful, area, denial, or, channelizing, weapons, moored, mines, usually, have, lifetimes, of, more, than, 10, years, and, some, almost, unlimited, these, mines, usually, weigh, 200, kg, 440, lb, including, 80, kg, 180, lb, of, explosives, rdx, in, excess, of, 150, kg, 330, lb, of, explosives, the, mine, becomes, inefficient, as, it, becomes, too, large, to, handle, and, the, extra, explosives, add, little, to, the, mine, s, effectiveness, bottom, mines, sometimes, called, ground, mines, are, used, when, the, water, is, no, more, than, 60, meters, 200, feet, deep, or, when, mining, for, submarines, down, to, around, 200, meters, 660, feet, they, are, much, harder, to, detect, and, sweep, and, can, carry, a, much, larger, warhead, than, a, moored, mine, bottom, mines, commonly, use, multiple, types, of, sensors, which, are, less, sensitive, to, sweeping, these, mines, usually, weigh, between, 150, and, 1, 500, kg, 330, and, 3, 310, lb, including, between, 125, and, 1, 400, kg, 276, and, 3, 086, lb, of, explosives, several, specialized, mines, have, been, developed, for, other, purposes, than, the, common, minefield, the, bouquet, mine, is, a, single, anchor, attached, to, several, floating, mines, it, is, designed, so, that, when, one, mine, is, swept, or, detonated, another, takes, its, place, it, is, a, very, sensitive, construction, and, lacks, reliability, the, anti, sweep, mine, is, a, very, small, mine, 40, kg, 88, lb, warhead, with, as, small, a, floating, device, as, possible, when, the, wire, of, a, mine, sweep, hits, the, anchor, wire, of, the, mine, it, drags, the, anchor, wire, along, with, it, pulling, the, mine, down, into, contact, with, the, sweeping, wire, that, detonates, the, mine, and, cuts, the, sweeping, wire, they, are, very, cheap, and, usually, used, in, combination, with, other, mines, in, a, minefield, to, make, sweeping, more, difficult, one, type, is, the, mark, 23, used, by, the, united, states, during, world, war, ii, the, mine, is, hydrostatically, controlled, to, maintain, a, pre, set, depth, below, the, water, s, surface, independently, of, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, tide, the, ascending, mine, is, a, floating, distance, mine, that, may, cut, its, mooring, or, in, some, other, way, float, higher, when, it, detects, a, target, it, lets, a, single, floating, mine, cover, a, much, larger, depth, range, these, are, mines, containing, a, moving, weapon, as, a, warhead, either, a, torpedo, or, a, rocket, a, russian, invention, the, rocket, mine, is, a, bottom, distance, mine, that, fires, a, homing, high, speed, rocket, not, torpedo, upwards, towards, the, target, it, is, intended, to, allow, a, bottom, mine, to, attack, surface, ships, as, well, as, submarines, from, a, greater, depth, one, type, is, the, te, 1, rocket, propelled, mine, a, torpedo, mine, is, a, self, propelled, variety, able, to, lie, in, wait, for, a, target, and, then, pursue, it, e, g, the, mark, 60, captor, generally, torpedo, mines, incorporate, computerised, acoustic, and, magnetic, fuzes, the, u, s, mark, 24, mine, code, named, fido, was, actually, an, asw, homing, torpedo, the, mine, designation, was, disinformation, to, conceal, its, function, the, mine, is, propelled, to, its, intended, position, by, propulsion, equipment, such, as, a, torpedo, after, reaching, its, destination, it, sinks, to, the, seabed, and, operates, like, a, standard, mine, it, differs, from, the, homing, mine, in, that, its, mobile, stage, is, set, before, it, lies, in, wait, rather, than, as, part, of, the, attacking, phase, one, such, design, is, the, mk, 67, submarine, launched, mobile, mine, which, is, based, on, a, mark, 37, torpedo, capable, of, traveling, as, far, as, 16, km, 10, mi, through, or, into, a, channel, harbour, shallow, water, area, and, other, zones, which, would, normally, be, inaccessible, to, craft, laying, the, device, after, reaching, the, target, area, they, sink, to, the, sea, bed, and, act, like, conventionally, laid, influence, mines, during, the, cold, war, a, test, was, conducted, with, a, naval, mine, fitted, with, tactical, nuclear, warheads, for, the, baker, shot, of, operation, crossroads, this, weapon, was, experimental, and, never, went, into, production, there, have, been, some, reports, that, north, korea, may, be, developing, a, nuclear, mine, the, seabed, arms, control, treaty, prohibits, the, placement, of, nuclear, weapons, on, the, seabed, beyond, a, 12, mile, coast, zone, this, comprises, two, moored, floating, contact, mines, which, are, tethered, together, by, a, length, of, steel, cable, or, chain, typically, each, mine, is, situated, approximately, 18, m, 60, ft, away, from, its, neighbor, and, each, floats, a, few, meters, below, the, surface, of, the, ocean, when, the, target, ship, hits, the, steel, cable, the, mines, on, either, side, are, drawn, down, the, side, of, the, ship, s, hull, exploding, on, contact, in, this, manner, it, is, almost, impossible, for, target, ships, to, pass, safely, between, two, individually, moored, mines, daisy, chained, mines, are, a, very, simple, concept, which, was, used, during, world, war, ii, the, first, prototype, of, the, daisy, chained, mine, and, the, first, combat, use, came, in, finland, 1939, plastic, drums, filled, with, sand, or, concrete, are, periodically, rolled, off, the, side, of, ships, as, real, mines, are, laid, in, large, mine, fields, these, inexpensive, false, targets, designed, to, be, of, a, similar, shape, and, size, as, genuine, mines, are, intended, to, slow, down, the, process, of, mine, clearance, a, mine, hunter, is, forced, to, investigate, each, suspicious, sonar, contact, on, the, sea, bed, whether, it, is, real, or, not, often, a, maker, of, naval, mines, will, provide, both, training, and, dummy, versions, of, their, mines, historically, several, methods, were, used, to, lay, mines, during, wwi, and, wwii, the, germans, used, u, boats, to, lay, mines, around, the, uk, in, wwii, aircraft, came, into, favour, for, mine, laying, with, one, of, the, largest, examples, being, the, mining, of, the, japanese, sea, routes, in, operation, starvation, laying, a, minefield, is, a, relatively, fast, process, with, specialized, ships, which, is, today, the, most, common, method, these, minelayers, can, carry, several, thousand, mines, and, manoeuvre, with, high, precision, the, mines, are, dropped, at, predefined, intervals, into, the, water, behind, the, ship, each, mine, is, recorded, for, later, clearing, but, it, is, not, unusual, for, these, records, to, be, lost, together, with, the, ships, therefore, many, countries, demand, that, all, mining, operations, be, planned, on, land, and, records, kept, so, that, the, mines, can, later, be, recovered, more, easily, other, methods, to, lay, minefields, include, in, some, cases, mines, are, automatically, activated, upon, contact, with, the, water, in, others, a, safety, lanyard, is, pulled, one, end, attached, to, the, rail, of, a, ship, aircraft, or, torpedo, tube, which, starts, an, automatic, timer, countdown, before, the, arming, process, is, complete, typically, the, automatic, safety, arming, process, takes, some, minutes, to, complete, this, allows, the, people, laying, the, mines, sufficient, time, to, move, out, of, its, activation, and, blast, zones, in, the, 1930s, germany, had, experimented, with, the, laying, of, mines, by, aircraft, it, became, a, crucial, element, in, their, overall, mining, strategy, aircraft, had, the, advantage, of, speed, and, they, would, never, get, caught, in, their, own, minefields, german, mines, held, a, large, 450, kg, 1, 000, lb, explosive, charge, from, april, to, june, 1940, the, luftwaffe, laid, 1, 000, mines, in, british, waters, soviet, ports, were, mined, as, was, the, arctic, convoy, route, to, murmansk, the, heinkel, he, 115, could, carry, two, medium, or, one, large, mine, while, the, heinkel, he, 59, dornier, do, 18, junkers, ju, 88, and, heinkel, he, 111, could, carry, more, the, ussr, was, relatively, ineffective, in, its, use, of, naval, mines, in, wwii, in, comparison, with, its, record, in, previous, wars, small, mines, were, developed, for, use, in, rivers, and, lakes, and, special, mines, for, shallow, water, a, very, large, chemical, mine, was, designed, to, sink, through, ice, with, the, aid, of, a, melting, compound, special, aerial, mine, designs, finally, arrived, in, 1943, 1944, the, amd, 500, and, amd, 1000, various, soviet, naval, aviation, torpedo, bombers, were, pressed, into, the, role, of, aerial, mining, in, the, baltic, sea, and, the, black, sea, including, ilyushin, db, 3s, il, 4s, and, lend, lease, douglas, boston, iiis, in, september, 1939, the, uk, announced, the, placement, of, extensive, defensive, minefields, in, waters, surrounding, the, home, islands, offensive, aerial, mining, operations, began, in, april, 1940, when, 38, mines, were, laid, at, each, of, these, locations, the, elbe, river, the, port, of, l, beck, and, the, german, naval, base, at, kiel, in, the, next, 20, months, mines, delivered, by, aircraft, sank, or, damaged, 164, axis, ships, with, the, loss, of, 94, aircraft, by, comparison, direct, aerial, attacks, on, axis, shipping, had, sunk, or, damaged, 105, vessels, at, a, cost, of, 373, aircraft, lost, the, advantage, of, aerial, mining, became, clear, and, the, uk, prepared, for, it, a, total, of, 48, 000, aerial, mines, were, laid, by, the, royal, air, force, raf, in, the, european, theatre, during, world, war, ii, as, early, as, 1942, american, mining, experts, such, as, naval, ordnance, laboratory, scientist, dr, ellis, a, johnson, cdr, usnr, suggested, massive, aerial, mining, operations, against, japan, s, outer, zone, korea, and, northern, china, as, well, as, the, inner, zone, their, home, islands, first, aerial, mines, would, have, to, be, developed, further, and, manufactured, in, large, numbers, second, laying, the, mines, would, require, a, sizable, air, group, the, us, army, air, forces, had, the, carrying, capacity, but, considered, mining, to, be, the, navy, s, job, the, us, navy, lacked, suitable, aircraft, johnson, set, about, convincing, general, curtis, lemay, of, the, efficacy, of, heavy, bombers, laying, aerial, mines, b, 24, liberators, pby, catalinas, and, other, bomber, aircraft, took, part, in, localized, mining, operations, in, the, southwest, pacific, and, the, china, burma, india, cbi, theaters, beginning, with, a, successful, attack, on, the, yangon, river, in, february, 1943, aerial, minelaying, operations, involved, a, coalition, of, british, australian, and, american, aircrews, with, the, raf, and, the, royal, australian, air, force, raaf, carrying, out, 60, of, the, sorties, and, the, usaaf, and, us, navy, covering, 40, both, british, and, american, mines, were, used, japanese, merchant, shipping, suffered, tremendous, losses, while, japanese, mine, sweeping, forces, were, spread, too, thin, attending, to, far, flung, ports, and, extensive, coastlines, admiral, thomas, c, kinkaid, who, directed, nearly, all, raaf, mining, operations, in, cbi, heartily, endorsed, aerial, mining, writing, in, july, 1944, that, aerial, mining, operations, were, of, the, order, of, 100, times, as, destructive, to, the, enemy, as, an, equal, number, of, bombing, missions, against, land, targets, a, single, b, 24, dropped, three, mines, into, haiphong, harbour, in, october, 1943, one, of, those, mines, sank, a, japanese, freighter, another, b, 24, dropped, three, more, mines, into, the, harbour, in, november, and, a, second, freighter, was, sunk, by, a, mine, the, threat, of, the, remaining, mines, prevented, a, convoy, of, ten, ships, from, entering, haiphong, and, six, of, those, ships, were, sunk, by, attacks, before, they, reached, a, safe, harbour, the, japanese, closed, haiphong, to, all, steel, hulled, ships, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, after, another, small, ship, was, sunk, by, one, of, the, remaining, mines, although, they, may, not, have, realized, no, more, than, three, mines, remained, using, grumman, tbf, avenger, torpedo, bombers, the, us, navy, mounted, a, direct, aerial, mining, attack, on, enemy, shipping, in, palau, on, 30, march, 1944, in, concert, with, simultaneous, conventional, bombing, and, strafing, attacks, the, dropping, of, 78, mines, deterred, 32, japanese, ships, from, escaping, koror, harbour, and, 23, of, those, immobilized, ships, were, sunk, in, a, subsequent, bombing, raid, the, combined, operation, sank, or, damaged, 36, ships, two, avengers, were, lost, and, their, crews, were, recovered, the, mines, brought, port, usage, to, a, halt, for, 20, days, japanese, mine, sweeping, was, unsuccessful, and, the, japanese, abandoned, palau, as, a, base, when, their, first, ship, attempting, to, traverse, the, swept, channel, was, damaged, by, a, mine, detonation, in, march, 1945, operation, starvation, began, in, earnest, using, 160, of, lemay, s, b, 29, superfortress, bombers, to, attack, japan, s, inner, zone, almost, half, of, the, mines, were, the, us, built, mark, 25, model, carrying, 570, kg, 1, 250, lb, of, explosives, and, weighing, about, 900, kg, 2, 000, lb, other, mines, used, included, the, smaller, 500, kg, 1, 000, lb, mark, 26, fifteen, b, 29s, were, lost, while, 293, japanese, merchant, ships, were, sunk, or, damaged, twelve, thousand, aerial, mines, were, laid, a, significant, barrier, to, japan, s, access, to, outside, resources, prince, fumimaro, konoe, said, after, the, war, that, the, aerial, mining, by, b, 29s, had, been, equally, as, effective, as, the, b, 29, attacks, on, japanese, industry, at, the, closing, stages, of, the, war, when, all, food, supplies, and, critical, material, were, prevented, from, reaching, the, japanese, home, islands, the, united, states, strategic, bombing, survey, pacific, war, concluded, that, it, would, have, been, more, efficient, to, combine, the, united, states, s, effective, anti, shipping, submarine, effort, with, land, and, carrier, based, air, power, to, strike, harder, against, merchant, shipping, and, begin, a, more, extensive, aerial, mining, campaign, earlier, in, the, war, survey, analysts, projected, that, this, would, have, starved, japan, forcing, an, earlier, end, to, the, war, after, the, war, dr, johnson, looked, at, the, japan, inner, zone, shipping, results, comparing, the, total, economic, cost, of, submarine, delivered, mines, versus, air, dropped, mines, and, found, that, though, 1, in, 12, submarine, mines, connected, with, the, enemy, as, opposed, to, 1, in, 21, for, aircraft, mines, the, aerial, mining, operation, was, about, ten, times, less, expensive, per, enemy, ton, sunk, between, 600, 000, and, 1, 000, 000, naval, mines, of, all, types, were, laid, in, wwii, advancing, military, forces, worked, to, clear, mines, from, newly, taken, areas, but, extensive, minefields, remained, in, place, after, the, war, air, dropped, mines, had, an, additional, problem, for, mine, sweeping, operations, they, were, not, meticulously, charted, in, japan, much, of, the, b, 29, mine, laying, work, had, been, performed, at, high, altitude, with, the, drifting, on, the, wind, of, mines, carried, by, parachute, adding, a, randomizing, factor, to, their, placement, generalized, danger, areas, were, identified, with, only, the, quantity, of, mines, given, in, detail, mines, used, in, operation, starvation, were, supposed, to, be, self, sterilizing, but, the, circuit, did, not, always, work, clearing, the, mines, from, japanese, waters, took, so, many, years, that, the, task, was, eventually, given, to, the, japan, maritime, self, defense, force, for, the, purpose, of, clearing, all, types, of, naval, mines, the, royal, navy, employed, german, crews, and, minesweepers, from, june, 1945, to, january, 1948, organised, in, the, german, mine, sweeping, administration, gmsa, which, consisted, of, 27, 000, members, of, the, former, kriegsmarine, and, 300, vessels, mine, clearing, was, not, always, successful, a, number, of, ships, were, damaged, or, sunk, by, mines, after, the, war, two, such, examples, were, the, liberty, ships, pierre, gibault, which, was, scrapped, after, hitting, a, mine, in, a, previously, cleared, area, off, the, greek, island, of, kythira, in, june, 1945, and, nathaniel, bacon, which, hit, a, minefield, off, civitavecchia, italy, in, december, 1945, caught, fire, was, beached, and, broke, in, two, the, damage, that, may, be, caused, by, a, mine, depends, on, the, shock, factor, value, a, combination, of, the, initial, strength, of, the, explosion, and, of, the, distance, between, the, target, and, the, detonation, when, taken, in, reference, to, ship, hull, plating, the, term, hull, shock, factor, hsf, is, used, while, keel, damage, is, termed, keel, shock, factor, ksf, if, the, explosion, is, directly, underneath, the, keel, then, hsf, is, equal, to, ksf, but, explosions, that, are, not, directly, underneath, the, ship, will, have, a, lower, value, of, ksf, usually, only, created, by, contact, mines, direct, damage, is, a, hole, blown, in, the, ship, among, the, crew, fragmentation, wounds, are, the, most, common, form, of, damage, flooding, typically, occurs, in, one, or, two, main, watertight, compartments, which, can, sink, smaller, ships, or, disable, larger, ones, contact, mine, damage, often, occurs, at, or, close, to, the, waterline, near, the, bow, but, depending, on, circumstances, a, ship, could, be, hit, anywhere, on, its, outer, hull, surface, the, uss, samuel, b, roberts, mine, attack, being, a, good, example, of, a, contact, mine, detonating, amidships, and, underneath, the, ship, the, bubble, jet, effect, occurs, when, a, mine, or, torpedo, detonates, in, the, water, a, short, distance, away, from, the, targeted, ship, the, explosion, creates, a, bubble, in, the, water, and, due, to, the, difference, in, pressure, the, bubble, will, collapse, from, the, bottom, the, bubble, is, buoyant, and, so, it, rises, towards, the, surface, if, the, bubble, reaches, the, surface, as, it, collapses, it, can, create, a, pillar, of, water, that, can, go, over, a, hundred, meters, into, the, air, a, columnar, plume, if, conditions, are, right, and, the, bubble, collapses, onto, the, ship, s, hull, the, damage, to, the, ship, can, be, extremely, serious, the, collapsing, bubble, forms, a, high, energy, jet, similar, to, a, shaped, charge, that, can, break, a, metre, wide, hole, straight, through, the, ship, flooding, one, or, more, compartments, and, is, capable, of, breaking, smaller, ships, apart, the, crew, in, the, areas, hit, by, the, pillar, are, usually, killed, instantly, other, damage, is, usually, limited, the, baengnyeong, incident, in, which, the, roks, cheonan, broke, in, half, and, sank, off, the, coast, south, korea, in, 2010, was, caused, by, the, bubble, jet, effect, according, to, an, international, investigation, if, the, mine, detonates, at, a, distance, from, the, ship, the, change, in, water, pressure, causes, the, ship, to, resonate, this, is, frequently, the, most, deadly, type, of, explosion, if, it, is, strong, enough, the, whole, ship, is, dangerously, shaken, and, everything, on, board, is, tossed, around, engines, rip, from, their, beds, cables, from, their, holders, etc, a, badly, shaken, ship, usually, sinks, quickly, with, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, small, leaks, all, over, the, ship, and, no, way, to, power, the, pumps, the, crew, fare, no, better, as, the, violent, shaking, tosses, them, around, this, shaking, is, powerful, enough, to, cause, disabling, injury, to, knees, and, other, joints, in, the, body, particularly, if, the, affected, person, stands, on, surfaces, connected, directly, to, the, hull, such, as, steel, decks, the, resulting, gas, cavitation, and, shock, front, differential, over, the, width, of, the, human, body, is, sufficient, to, stun, or, kill, divers, weapons, are, frequently, a, few, steps, ahead, of, countermeasures, and, mines, are, no, exception, in, this, field, the, british, with, their, large, seagoing, navy, have, had, the, bulk, of, world, experience, and, most, anti, mine, developments, such, as, degaussing, and, the, double, l, sweep, were, british, inventions, when, on, operational, missions, such, as, the, invasion, of, iraq, the, us, still, relies, on, british, and, canadian, minesweeping, services, the, us, has, worked, on, some, innovative, mine, hunting, countermeasures, such, as, the, use, of, military, dolphins, to, detect, and, flag, mines, however, they, are, of, questionable, effectiveness, mines, in, nearshore, environments, remain, a, particular, challenge, they, are, small, and, as, technology, has, developed, they, can, have, anechoic, coatings, be, non, metallic, and, oddly, shaped, to, resist, detection, 18, further, oceanic, conditions, and, the, sea, bottoms, of, the, area, of, operations, can, degrade, sweeping, and, hunting, efforts, 18, mining, countermeasures, are, far, more, expensive, and, time, consuming, than, mining, operations, and, that, gap, is, only, growing, with, new, technologies, 18, ships, can, be, designed, to, be, difficult, for, mines, to, detect, to, avoid, detonating, them, this, is, especially, true, for, minesweepers, and, mine, hunters, that, work, in, minefields, where, a, minimal, signature, outweighs, the, need, for, armour, and, speed, these, ships, have, hulls, of, glass, fibre, or, wood, instead, of, steel, to, avoid, magnetic, signatures, these, ships, may, use, special, propulsion, systems, with, low, magnetic, electric, motors, to, reduce, magnetic, signature, and, voith, schneider, propellers, to, limit, the, acoustic, signature, they, are, built, with, hulls, that, produce, a, minimal, pressure, signature, these, measures, create, other, problems, they, are, expensive, slow, and, vulnerable, to, enemy, fire, many, modern, ships, have, a, mine, warning, sonar, a, simple, sonar, looking, forward, and, warning, the, crew, if, it, detects, possible, mines, ahead, it, is, only, effective, when, the, ship, is, moving, slowly, see, also, sqq, 32, mine, hunting, sonar, a, steel, hulled, ship, can, be, degaussed, more, correctly, de, oerstedted, or, depermed, using, a, special, degaussing, station, that, contains, many, large, coils, and, induces, a, magnetic, field, in, the, hull, with, alternating, current, to, demagnetize, the, hull, this, is, a, rather, problematic, solution, as, magnetic, compasses, need, recalibration, and, all, metal, objects, must, be, kept, in, exactly, the, same, place, ships, slowly, regain, their, magnetic, field, as, they, travel, through, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, so, the, process, has, to, be, repeated, every, six, months, a, simpler, variation, of, this, technique, called, wiping, was, developed, by, charles, f, goodeve, which, saved, time, and, resources, between, 1941, and, 1943, the, us, naval, gun, factory, a, division, of, the, naval, ordnance, laboratory, in, washington, d, c, built, physical, models, of, all, us, naval, ships, three, kinds, of, steel, were, used, in, shipbuilding, mild, steel, for, bulkheads, a, mixture, of, mild, steel, and, high, tensile, steel, for, the, hull, and, special, treatment, steel, for, armor, plate, the, models, were, placed, within, coils, which, could, simulate, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, any, location, the, magnetic, signatures, were, measured, with, degaussing, coils, the, objective, was, to, reduce, the, vertical, component, of, the, combination, of, the, earth, s, field, and, the, ship, s, field, at, the, usual, depth, of, german, mines, from, the, measurements, coils, were, placed, and, coil, currents, were, determined, to, minimize, the, chance, of, detonation, for, any, ship, at, any, heading, at, any, latitude, some, ships, are, built, with, magnetic, inductors, large, coils, placed, along, the, ship, to, counter, the, ship, s, magnetic, field, using, magnetic, probes, in, strategic, parts, of, the, ship, the, strength, of, the, current, in, the, coils, can, be, adjusted, to, minimize, the, total, magnetic, field, this, is, a, heavy, and, clumsy, solution, suited, only, to, small, to, medium, sized, ships, boats, typically, lack, the, generators, and, space, for, the, solution, while, the, amount, of, power, needed, to, overcome, the, magnetic, field, of, a, large, ship, is, impractical, active, countermeasures, are, ways, to, clear, a, path, through, a, minefield, or, remove, it, completely, this, is, one, of, the, most, important, tasks, of, any, mine, warfare, flotilla, a, sweep, is, either, a, contact, sweep, a, wire, dragged, through, the, water, by, one, or, two, ships, to, cut, the, mooring, wire, of, floating, mines, or, a, distance, sweep, that, mimics, a, ship, to, detonate, the, mines, the, sweeps, are, dragged, by, minesweepers, either, purpose, built, military, ships, or, converted, trawlers, each, run, covers, between, one, hundred, and, two, hundred, metres, 330, and, 660, ft, and, the, ships, must, move, slowly, in, a, straight, line, making, them, vulnerable, to, enemy, fire, this, was, exploited, by, the, turkish, army, in, the, battle, of, gallipoli, in, 1915, when, mobile, howitzer, batteries, prevented, the, british, and, french, from, clearing, a, way, through, minefields, if, a, contact, sweep, hits, a, mine, the, wire, of, the, sweep, rubs, against, the, mooring, wire, until, it, is, cut, sometimes, cutters, explosive, devices, to, cut, the, mine, s, wire, are, used, to, lessen, the, strain, on, the, sweeping, wire, mines, cut, free, are, recorded, and, collected, for, research, or, shot, with, a, deck, gun, minesweepers, protect, themselves, with, an, oropesa, or, paravane, instead, of, a, second, minesweeper, these, are, torpedo, shaped, towed, bodies, similar, in, shape, to, a, harvey, torpedo, that, are, streamed, from, the, sweeping, vessel, thus, keeping, the, sweep, at, a, determined, depth, and, position, some, large, warships, were, routinely, equipped, with, paravane, sweeps, near, the, bows, in, case, they, inadvertently, sailed, into, minefields, the, mine, would, be, deflected, towards, the, paravane, by, the, wire, instead, of, towards, the, ship, by, its, wake, more, recently, heavy, lift, helicopters, have, dragged, minesweeping, sleds, as, in, the, 1991, persian, gulf, war, the, distance, sweep, mimics, the, sound, and, magnetism, of, a, ship, and, is, pulled, behind, the, sweeper, it, has, floating, coils, and, large, underwater, drums, it, is, the, only, sweep, effective, against, bottom, mines, during, wwii, raf, coastal, command, used, vickers, wellington, bombers, wellington, dw, mk, i, fitted, with, degaussing, coils, to, trigger, magnetic, mines, in, a, parallel, development, the, luftwaffe, adapted, some, junkers, 52, 3m, aircraft, to, also, carry, a, coil, operated, by, electricity, supplied, from, an, onboard, generator, the, luftwaffe, called, this, adaption, minensuch, e, lit, mine, search, in, both, cases, pilots, were, required, to, fly, at, low, altitude, up, to, about, 200, feet, above, the, sea, and, at, fairly, low, speeds, to, be, effective, modern, influence, mines, are, designed, to, discriminate, against, false, inputs, and, are, therefore, much, harder, to, sweep, they, often, contain, inherent, anti, sweeping, mechanisms, for, example, they, may, be, programmed, to, respond, to, the, unique, noise, of, a, particular, ship, type, its, associated, magnetic, signature, and, the, typical, pressure, displacement, of, such, a, vessel, as, a, result, a, mine, sweeper, must, accurately, mimic, the, required, target, signature, to, trigger, detonation, the, task, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, an, influence, mine, may, have, one, or, more, of, a, hundred, different, potential, target, signatures, programmed, into, it, another, anti, sweeping, mechanism, is, a, ship, counter, in, the, mine, fuze, when, enabled, this, allows, detonation, only, after, the, mine, fuze, has, been, triggered, a, pre, set, number, of, times, to, further, complicate, matters, influence, mines, may, be, programmed, to, arm, themselves, or, disarm, automatically, known, as, self, sterilization, after, a, pre, set, time, during, the, pre, set, arming, delay, which, could, last, days, or, even, weeks, the, mine, would, remain, dormant, and, ignore, any, target, stimulus, whether, genuine, or, false, when, influence, mines, are, laid, in, an, ocean, minefield, they, may, have, various, combinations, of, fuze, settings, configured, for, example, some, mines, with, the, acoustic, sensor, enabled, may, become, active, within, three, hours, of, being, laid, others, with, the, acoustic, and, magnetic, sensors, enabled, may, become, active, after, two, weeks, but, have, the, ship, counter, mechanism, set, to, ignore, the, first, two, trigger, events, and, still, others, in, the, same, minefield, with, the, magnetic, and, pressure, sensors, enabled, may, not, become, armed, until, three, weeks, have, passed, groups, of, mines, within, this, mine, field, may, have, different, target, signatures, which, may, or, may, not, overlap, the, fuzes, on, influence, mines, allow, many, different, permutations, which, complicates, the, clearance, process, mines, with, ship, counters, arming, delays, and, highly, specific, target, signatures, in, mine, fuzes, can, falsely, convince, a, belligerent, that, a, particular, area, is, clear, of, mines, or, has, been, swept, effectively, because, a, succession, of, vessels, have, already, passed, through, safely, as, naval, mines, have, become, more, sophisticated, and, able, to, discriminate, between, targets, so, they, have, become, more, difficult, to, deal, with, by, conventional, sweeping, this, has, given, rise, to, the, practice, of, minehunting, minehunting, is, very, different, from, sweeping, although, some, minehunters, can, do, both, tasks, minehunting, pays, little, attention, to, the, nature, of, the, mine, itself, nor, does, the, method, change, much, at, the, current, state, of, the, art, minehunting, remains, the, best, way, to, deal, with, influence, mines, proving, to, be, both, safer, and, more, effective, than, sweeping, specialized, high, frequency, sonars, and, high, fidelity, sidescaning, sonar, are, used, for, mine, location, 18, mines, are, hunted, using, sonar, then, inspected, and, destroyed, either, by, divers, or, rovs, remote, controlled, unmanned, mini, submarines, it, is, slow, but, also, the, most, reliable, way, to, remove, mines, minehunting, started, during, the, second, world, war, but, it, was, only, after, the, war, that, it, became, truly, effective, sea, mammals, mainly, the, bottlenose, dolphin, have, been, trained, to, hunt, and, mark, mines, most, famously, by, the, u, s, navy, marine, mammal, program, mine, clearance, dolphins, were, deployed, in, the, persian, gulf, during, the, iraq, war, in, 2003, the, us, navy, claims, that, these, dolphins, were, effective, in, helping, to, clear, more, than, 100, antiship, mines, and, underwater, booby, traps, from, umm, qasr, port, french, naval, officer, jacques, yves, cousteau, s, undersea, research, group, was, once, involved, in, minehunting, operations, they, removed, or, detonated, a, variety, of, german, mines, but, one, particularly, defusion, resistant, batch, equipped, with, acutely, sensitive, pressure, magnetic, and, acoustic, sensors, and, wired, together, so, that, one, explosion, would, trigger, the, rest, was, simply, left, undisturbed, for, years, until, corrosion, would, hopefully, disable, the, mines, a, more, drastic, method, is, simply, to, run, a, ship, through, the, minefield, letting, other, ships, safely, follow, the, same, path, an, early, example, of, this, was, farragut, s, actions, at, mobile, bay, during, the, american, civil, war, however, as, mine, warfare, became, more, developed, this, method, became, uneconomical, this, method, was, revived, by, the, german, imperial, german, navy, during, world, war, i, left, with, a, surfeit, of, idle, ships, due, to, the, allied, blockade, the, germans, introduced, a, ship, known, as, sperrbrecher, block, breaker, the, type, was, also, used, during, world, war, ii, typically, an, old, cargo, ship, loaded, with, cargo, that, made, her, less, vulnerable, to, sinking, wood, for, example, the, sperrbrecher, was, run, ahead, of, the, ship, to, be, protected, detonating, any, mines, that, might, be, in, their, path, the, use, of, sperrbrecher, obviated, the, need, to, continuous, and, painstaking, sweeping, but, the, cost, was, high, over, half, the, 100, or, so, ships, used, as, sperrbrecher, in, wwii, were, sunk, during, the, war, alternatively, a, shallow, draught, vessel, can, be, steamed, through, the, minefield, at, high, speed, to, generate, a, pressure, wave, sufficient, to, trigger, mines, with, the, minesweeper, moving, fast, enough, to, be, sufficiently, clear, of, the, pressure, wave, so, that, triggered, mines, do, not, destroy, the, ship, itself, these, techniques, are, the, only, way, to, sweep, pressure, mines, that, is, publicly, known, to, be, employed, the, technique, can, be, simply, countered, by, use, of, a, ship, counter, set, to, allow, a, certain, number, of, passes, before, the, mine, is, actually, triggered, modern, doctrine, calls, for, ground, mines, to, be, hunted, rather, than, swept, a, new, system, is, being, introduced, for, sweeping, pressure, mines, however, counters, are, going, to, remain, a, problem, an, updated, form, of, this, method, is, the, use, of, small, unmanned, rovs, such, as, the, seehund, drone, that, simulate, the, acoustic, and, magnetic, signatures, of, larger, ships, and, are, built, to, survive, exploding, mines, repeated, sweeps, would, be, required, in, case, one, or, more, of, the, mines, had, its, ship, counter, facility, enabled, i, e, were, programmed, to, ignore, the, first, 2, 3, or, even, 6, target, activations, another, expedient, for, clearing, mines, especially, in, a, hurry, is, counter, mining, by, this, method, an, explosive, is, detonated, in, the, area, of, a, known, or, suspected, minefield, and, the, blast, either, trips, off, the, fuses, or, the, actual, explosive, contained, within, the, mine, or, mines, this, latter, is, known, as, a, sympathetic, detonation, counter, mining, is, normally, used, as, a, last, resort, or, if, other, equipment, is, not, available, one, example, was, at, the, entrance, to, grand, harbour, valletta, malta, in, ww2, when, the, british, dropped, depth, charges, into, the, harbour, entrance, to, detonate, suspected, mines, prior, to, the, arrival, of, an, important, convoy, it, is, especially, useful, against, acoustic, or, pressure, mines, due, to, their, activation, by, sound, or, increases, in, water, pressure, the, united, states, navy, mk56, asw, mine, the, oldest, still, in, use, by, the, united, states, was, developed, in, 1966, more, advanced, mines, include, the, mk60, captor, short, for, encapsulated, torpedo, the, mk62, and, mk63, quickstrike, and, the, mk67, slmm, submarine, launched, mobile, mine, today, most, u, s, naval, mines, are, delivered, by, aircraft, mk67, slmm, submarine, launched, mobile, mine, the, slmm, was, developed, by, the, united, states, as, a, submarine, deployed, mine, for, use, in, areas, inaccessible, for, other, mine, deployment, techniques, or, for, covert, mining, of, hostile, environments, the, slmm, is, a, shallow, water, mine, and, is, basically, a, modified, mark, 37, torpedo, general, characteristics, mk65, quickstrike, the, quickstrike, is, a, family, of, shallow, water, aircraft, laid, mines, used, by, the, united, states, primarily, against, surface, craft, the, mk65, is, a, 910, kg, 2, 000, lb, dedicated, purpose, built, mine, however, other, quickstrike, versions, mk62, mk63, and, mk64, are, converted, general, purpose, bombs, these, latter, three, mines, are, actually, a, single, type, of, electronic, fuze, fitted, to, mk82, mk83, and, mk84, air, dropped, bombs, because, this, latter, type, of, quickstrike, fuze, only, takes, up, a, small, amount, of, storage, space, compared, to, a, dedicated, sea, mine, the, air, dropped, bomb, casings, have, dual, purpose, i, e, can, be, fitted, with, conventional, contact, fuzes, and, dropped, on, land, targets, or, have, a, quickstrike, fuze, fitted, which, converts, them, into, sea, mines, general, characteristics, mk56, general, characteristics, according, to, a, statement, made, to, the, uk, parliament, in, 2002, the, royal, navy, does, not, have, any, mine, stocks, and, has, not, had, since, 1992, notwithstanding, this, the, united, kingdom, retains, the, capability, to, lay, mines, and, continues, research, into, mine, exploitation, practice, mines, used, for, exercises, continue, to, be, laid, in, order, to, retain, the, necessary, skills, however, a, british, company, bae, systems, does, manufacture, the, stonefish, influence, mine, for, export, to, friendly, countries, such, as, australia, which, has, both, war, stock, and, training, versions, of, stonefish, in, addition, to, stocks, of, smaller, italian, mn103, manta, mines, the, computerised, fuze, on, a, stonefish, mine, contains, acoustic, magnetic, and, water, pressure, displacement, target, detection, sensors, stonefish, can, be, deployed, by, fixed, wing, aircraft, helicopters, surface, vessels, and, submarines, an, optional, kit, is, available, to, allow, stonefish, to, be, air, dropped, comprising, an, aerodynamic, tail, fin, section, and, parachute, pack, to, retard, the, weapon, s, descent, the, operating, depth, of, stonefish, ranges, between, 30, and, 200, metres, the, mine, weighs, 990, kilograms, and, contains, a, 600, kilogram, aluminised, pbx, explosive, warhead, mine, warfare, remains, the, most, cost, effective, form, of, asymmetrical, naval, warfare, mines, are, relatively, cheap, and, being, small, allows, them, to, be, easily, deployed, indeed, with, some, kinds, of, mines, trucks, and, rafts, will, suffice, at, present, there, are, more, than, 300, different, mines, available, some, 50, countries, currently, have, mining, ability, the, number, of, naval, mine, producing, countries, has, increased, by, 75, since, 1988, it, is, also, noted, that, these, mines, are, of, an, increasing, sophistication, while, even, the, older, type, mines, present, a, significant, problem, it, has, been, noted, that, mine, warfare, may, become, an, issue, with, terrorist, organizations, mining, busy, shipping, straits, and, mining,
