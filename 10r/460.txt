telecommunication, often, used, in, its, plural, form, or, abbreviated, as, telecom, is, the, transmission, of, information, with, an, immediacy, comparable, to, face, to, face, communication, as, such, slow, communications, technologies, like, postal, mail, and, pneumatic, tubes, are, excluded, from, the, definition, many, transmission, media, have, been, used, for, telecommunications, throughout, history, from, smoke, signals, beacons, semaphore, telegraphs, signal, flags, and, optical, heliographs, to, wires, and, empty, space, made, to, carry, electromagnetic, signals, these, paths, of, transmission, may, be, divided, into, communication, channels, for, multiplexing, allowing, for, a, single, medium, to, transmit, several, concurrent, communication, sessions, several, methods, of, long, distance, communication, before, the, modern, era, used, sounds, like, coded, drumbeats, the, blowing, of, horns, and, whistles, long, distance, technologies, invented, during, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, generally, use, electric, power, and, include, the, telegraph, telephone, television, and, radio, early, telecommunication, networks, used, metal, wires, as, the, medium, for, transmitting, signals, these, networks, were, used, for, telegraphy, and, telephony, for, many, decades, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, a, revolution, in, wireless, communication, began, with, breakthroughs, including, those, made, in, radio, communications, by, guglielmo, marconi, who, won, the, 1909, nobel, prize, in, physics, other, early, pioneers, in, electrical, and, electronic, telecommunications, include, co, inventors, of, the, telegraph, charles, wheatstone, and, samuel, morse, numerous, inventors, and, developers, of, the, telephone, including, antonio, meucci, and, alexander, graham, bell, inventors, of, radio, edwin, armstrong, and, lee, de, forest, as, well, as, inventors, of, television, like, vladimir, k, zworykin, john, logie, baird, and, philo, farnsworth, since, the, 1960s, the, proliferation, of, digital, technologies, has, meant, that, voice, communications, have, gradually, been, supplemented, by, data, the, physical, limitations, of, metallic, media, prompted, the, development, of, optical, fibre, the, internet, a, technology, independent, of, any, given, medium, has, provided, global, access, to, services, for, individual, users, and, further, reduced, location, and, time, limitations, on, communications, telecommunication, is, a, compound, noun, of, the, greek, prefix, tele, meaning, distant, far, off, or, afar, and, the, latin, verb, communicare, meaning, to, share, its, modern, use, is, adapted, from, the, french, because, its, written, use, was, recorded, in, 1904, by, the, french, engineer, and, novelist, douard, estauni, communication, was, first, used, as, an, english, word, in, the, late, 14th, century, it, comes, from, old, french, comunicacion, 14c, modern, french, communication, from, latin, communicationem, nominative, communication, noun, of, action, from, past, participle, stem, of, communicare, to, share, divide, out, communicate, impart, inform, join, unite, participate, in, literally, to, make, common, from, communis, at, the, 1932, plenipotentiary, telegraph, conference, and, the, international, radiotelegraph, conference, in, madrid, the, two, organizations, merged, to, form, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, they, defined, telecommunication, as, any, telegraphic, or, telephonic, communication, of, signs, signals, writing, facsimiles, and, sounds, of, any, kind, by, wire, wireless, or, other, systems, or, processes, of, electric, signaling, or, visual, signaling, semaphores, the, definition, was, later, reconfirmed, according, to, article, 1, 3, of, the, itu, radio, regulations, which, defined, it, as, any, transmission, emission, or, reception, of, signs, signals, writings, images, and, sounds, or, intelligence, of, any, nature, by, wire, radio, optical, or, other, electromagnetic, systems, homing, pigeons, have, been, used, throughout, history, by, different, cultures, pigeon, post, had, persian, roots, and, was, later, used, by, the, romans, to, aid, their, military, frontinus, claimed, julius, caesar, used, pigeons, as, messengers, in, his, conquest, of, gaul, the, greeks, also, conveyed, the, names, of, the, victors, at, the, olympic, games, to, various, cities, using, homing, pigeons, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, dutch, government, used, the, system, in, java, and, sumatra, and, in, 1849, paul, julius, reuter, started, a, pigeon, service, to, fly, stock, prices, between, aachen, and, brussels, a, service, that, operated, for, a, year, until, the, gap, in, the, telegraph, link, was, closed, in, the, middle, ages, chains, of, beacons, were, commonly, used, on, hilltops, as, a, means, of, relaying, a, signal, beacon, chains, suffered, the, drawback, that, they, could, only, pass, a, single, bit, of, information, so, the, meaning, of, the, message, such, as, the, enemy, has, been, sighted, had, to, be, agreed, upon, in, advance, one, notable, instance, of, their, use, was, during, the, spanish, armada, when, a, beacon, chain, relayed, a, signal, from, plymouth, to, london, in, 1792, claude, chappe, a, french, engineer, built, the, first, fixed, visual, telegraphy, system, or, semaphore, line, between, lille, and, paris, however, semaphore, suffered, from, the, need, for, skilled, operators, and, expensive, towers, at, intervals, of, ten, to, thirty, kilometres, six, to, nineteen, miles, as, a, result, of, competition, from, the, electrical, telegraph, the, last, commercial, line, was, abandoned, in, 1880, on, july, 25, 1837, the, first, commercial, electrical, telegraph, was, demonstrated, by, english, inventor, sir, william, fothergill, cooke, and, english, scientist, sir, charles, wheatstone, both, inventors, viewed, their, device, as, an, improvement, to, the, electromagnetic, telegraph, and, not, as, a, new, device, samuel, morse, independently, developed, a, version, of, the, electrical, telegraph, that, he, unsuccessfully, demonstrated, on, september, 2, 1837, his, code, was, an, important, advance, over, wheatstone, s, signaling, method, the, first, transatlantic, telegraph, cable, was, successfully, completed, on, july, 27, 1866, allowing, transatlantic, telecommunication, for, the, first, time, the, conventional, telephone, was, patented, by, alexander, bell, in, 1876, elisha, gray, also, filed, a, caveat, for, it, in, 1876, gray, abandoned, his, caveat, and, because, he, did, not, contest, bell, s, priority, the, examiner, approved, bell, s, patent, on, march, 3, 1876, gray, had, filed, his, caveat, for, the, variable, resistance, telephone, but, bell, was, the, first, to, document, the, idea, and, test, it, in, a, telephone, antonio, meucci, invented, a, device, that, allowed, the, electrical, transmission, of, voice, over, a, line, nearly, 30, years, before, in, 1849, but, his, device, was, of, little, practical, value, because, it, relied, on, the, electrophonic, effect, requiring, users, to, place, the, receiver, in, their, mouths, to, hear, the, first, commercial, telephone, services, were, set, up, by, the, bell, telephone, company, in, 1878, and, 1879, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, in, the, cities, of, new, haven, and, london, in, 1894, italian, inventor, guglielmo, marconi, began, developing, a, wireless, communication, using, the, then, newly, discovered, phenomenon, of, radio, waves, demonstrating, by, 1901, that, they, could, be, transmitted, across, the, atlantic, ocean, this, was, the, start, of, wireless, telegraphy, by, radio, on, 17, december, 1902, a, transmission, from, the, marconi, station, in, glace, bay, nova, scotia, canada, became, the, world, s, first, radio, message, to, cross, the, atlantic, from, north, america, in, 1904, a, commercial, service, was, established, to, transmit, nightly, news, summaries, to, subscribing, ships, which, incorporated, them, into, their, onboard, newspapers, world, war, i, accelerated, the, development, of, radio, for, military, communications, after, the, war, commercial, radio, am, broadcasting, began, in, the, 1920s, and, became, an, important, mass, medium, for, entertainment, and, news, world, war, ii, again, accelerated, the, development, of, radio, for, the, wartime, purposes, of, aircraft, and, land, communication, radio, navigation, and, radar, development, of, stereo, fm, broadcasting, of, radio, began, in, the, 1930s, in, the, united, states, and, the, 1940s, in, the, united, kingdom, displacing, am, as, the, dominant, commercial, standard, in, the, 1970s, on, march, 25, 1925, john, logie, baird, demonstrated, the, transmission, of, moving, pictures, at, the, london, department, store, selfridges, baird, s, device, relied, upon, the, nipkow, disk, by, paul, nipkow, and, thus, became, known, as, the, mechanical, television, it, formed, the, basis, of, experimental, broadcasts, done, by, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, beginning, on, 30, september, 1929, however, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, televisions, depended, on, the, cathode, ray, tube, invented, by, karl, ferdinand, braun, the, first, version, of, such, a, television, to, show, promise, was, produced, by, philo, farnsworth, and, demonstrated, to, his, family, on, 7, september, 1927, after, world, war, ii, interrupted, experiments, resumed, and, television, became, an, important, home, entertainment, broadcast, medium, the, type, of, device, known, as, a, thermionic, tube, or, thermionic, valve, uses, thermionic, emission, of, electrons, from, a, heated, cathode, for, a, number, of, fundamental, electronic, functions, such, as, signal, amplification, and, current, rectification, the, simplest, vacuum, tube, the, diode, invented, in, 1904, by, john, ambrose, fleming, contains, only, a, heated, electron, emitting, cathode, and, an, anode, electrons, can, only, flow, in, one, direction, through, the, device, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, adding, one, or, more, control, grids, within, the, tube, enables, the, current, between, the, cathode, and, anode, to, be, controlled, by, the, voltage, on, the, grid, or, grids, these, devices, became, a, key, component, of, electronic, circuits, for, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, were, crucial, to, the, development, of, radio, television, radar, sound, recording, and, reproduction, long, distance, telephone, networks, and, analogue, and, early, digital, computers, while, some, applications, had, used, earlier, technologies, such, as, the, spark, gap, transmitter, for, radio, or, mechanical, computers, for, computing, it, was, the, invention, of, the, thermionic, vacuum, tube, that, made, these, technologies, widespread, and, practical, leading, to, the, creation, of, electronics, in, the, 1940s, the, invention, of, semiconductor, devices, made, it, possible, to, produce, solid, state, devices, which, are, smaller, cheaper, and, more, efficient, reliable, and, durable, than, thermionic, tubes, starting, in, the, mid, 1960s, thermionic, tubes, were, replaced, with, the, transistor, thermionic, tubes, still, have, some, applications, for, certain, high, frequency, amplifiers, on, 11, september, 1940, george, stibitz, transmitted, problems, for, his, complex, number, calculator, in, new, york, using, a, teletype, and, received, the, computed, results, back, at, dartmouth, college, in, new, hampshire, this, configuration, of, a, centralized, computer, mainframe, with, remote, dumb, terminals, remained, popular, well, into, the, 1970s, in, the, 1960s, paul, baran, and, independently, donald, davies, started, to, investigate, packet, switching, a, technology, that, sends, a, message, in, portions, to, its, destination, asynchronously, without, passing, it, through, a, centralized, mainframe, a, four, node, network, emerged, on, 5, december, 1969, constituting, the, beginnings, of, the, arpanet, which, by, 1981, had, grown, to, 213, nodes, arpanet, eventually, merged, with, other, networks, to, form, the, internet, while, internet, development, was, a, focus, of, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, who, published, a, series, of, request, for, comments, documents, other, networking, advancements, occurred, in, industrial, laboratories, such, as, the, local, area, network, lan, developments, of, ethernet, 1983, token, ring, 1984, and, star, network, topology, the, effective, capacity, to, exchange, information, worldwide, through, two, way, telecommunication, networks, grew, from, 281, petabytes, pb, of, optimally, compressed, information, in, 1986, to, 471, pb, in, 1993, to, 2, 2, exabytes, eb, in, 2000, to, 65, eb, in, 2007, this, is, the, informational, equivalent, of, two, newspaper, pages, per, person, per, day, in, 1986, and, six, entire, newspapers, per, person, per, day, by, 2007, given, this, growth, telecommunications, play, an, increasingly, important, role, in, the, world, economy, and, the, global, telecommunications, industry, was, about, a, 4, 7, trillion, sector, in, 2012, the, service, revenue, of, the, global, telecommunications, industry, was, estimated, to, be, 1, 5, trillion, in, 2010, corresponding, to, 2, 4, of, the, world, s, gross, domestic, product, gdp, modern, telecommunication, is, founded, on, a, series, of, key, concepts, that, experienced, progressive, development, and, refinement, in, a, period, of, well, over, a, century, telecommunication, technologies, may, primarily, be, divided, into, wired, and, wireless, methods, overall, a, basic, telecommunication, system, consists, of, three, main, parts, that, are, always, present, in, some, form, or, another, in, a, radio, broadcasting, station, the, station, s, large, power, amplifier, is, the, transmitter, and, the, broadcasting, antenna, is, the, interface, between, the, power, amplifier, and, the, free, space, channel, the, free, space, channel, is, the, transmission, medium, and, the, receiver, s, antenna, is, the, interface, between, the, free, space, channel, and, the, receiver, next, the, radio, receiver, is, the, destination, of, the, radio, signal, where, it, is, converted, from, electricity, to, sound, telecommunication, systems, are, occasionally, duplex, two, way, systems, with, a, single, box, of, electronics, working, as, both, the, transmitter, and, a, receiver, or, a, transceiver, e, g, a, mobile, phone, the, transmission, electronics, and, the, receiver, electronics, within, a, transceiver, are, quite, independent, of, one, another, this, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, radio, transmitters, contain, power, amplifiers, that, operate, with, electrical, powers, measured, in, watts, or, kilowatts, but, radio, receivers, deal, with, radio, powers, measured, in, microwatts, or, nanowatts, hence, transceivers, have, to, be, carefully, designed, and, built, to, isolate, their, high, power, circuitry, and, their, low, power, circuitry, from, each, other, to, avoid, interference, telecommunication, over, fixed, lines, is, called, point, to, point, communication, because, it, occurs, between, a, transmitter, and, a, receiver, telecommunication, through, radio, broadcasts, is, called, broadcast, communication, because, it, occurs, between, a, powerful, transmitter, and, numerous, low, power, but, sensitive, radio, receivers, telecommunications, in, which, multiple, transmitters, and, multiple, receivers, have, been, designed, to, cooperate, and, share, the, same, physical, channel, are, called, multiplex, systems, the, sharing, of, physical, channels, using, multiplexing, often, results, in, significant, cost, reduction, multiplexed, systems, are, laid, out, in, telecommunication, networks, and, multiplexed, signals, are, switched, at, nodes, through, to, the, correct, destination, terminal, receiver, communications, can, be, encoded, as, analogue, or, digital, signals, which, may, in, turn, be, carried, by, analogue, or, digital, communication, systems, analogue, signals, vary, continuously, with, respect, to, the, information, while, digital, signals, encode, information, as, a, set, of, discrete, values, e, g, a, set, of, ones, and, zeroes, during, propagation, and, reception, information, contained, in, analogue, signals, is, degraded, by, undesirable, noise, commonly, the, noise, in, a, communication, system, can, be, expressed, as, adding, or, subtracting, from, the, desirable, signal, via, a, random, process, this, form, of, noise, is, called, additive, noise, with, the, understanding, that, the, noise, can, be, negative, or, positive, at, different, instances, unless, the, additive, noise, disturbance, exceeds, a, certain, threshold, the, information, contained, in, digital, signals, will, remain, intact, their, resistance, to, noise, represents, a, key, advantage, of, digital, signals, over, analogue, signals, however, digital, systems, fail, catastrophically, when, noise, exceeds, the, system, s, ability, to, autocorrect, on, the, other, hand, analogue, systems, fail, gracefully, as, noise, increases, the, signal, becomes, progressively, more, degraded, but, still, usable, also, digital, transmission, of, continuous, data, unavoidably, adds, quantization, noise, to, the, output, this, can, be, reduced, but, not, eliminated, only, at, the, expense, of, increasing, the, channel, bandwidth, requirement, the, term, channel, has, two, different, meanings, in, one, meaning, a, channel, is, the, physical, medium, that, carries, a, signal, between, the, transmitter, and, the, receiver, examples, of, this, include, the, atmosphere, for, sound, communications, glass, optical, fibres, for, some, kinds, of, optical, communications, coaxial, cables, for, communications, by, way, of, the, voltages, and, electric, currents, in, them, and, free, space, for, communications, using, visible, light, infrared, waves, ultraviolet, light, and, radio, waves, coaxial, cable, types, are, classified, by, rg, type, or, radio, guide, terminology, derived, from, world, war, ii, the, various, rg, designations, are, used, to, classify, the, specific, signal, transmission, applications, this, last, channel, is, called, the, free, space, channel, the, sending, of, radio, waves, from, one, place, to, another, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, presence, or, absence, of, an, atmosphere, between, the, two, radio, waves, travel, through, a, perfect, vacuum, just, as, easily, as, they, travel, through, air, fog, clouds, or, any, other, kind, of, gas, the, other, meaning, of, the, term, channel, in, telecommunications, is, seen, in, the, phrase, communications, channel, which, is, a, subdivision, of, a, transmission, medium, so, that, it, can, be, used, to, send, multiple, streams, of, information, simultaneously, for, example, one, radio, station, can, broadcast, radio, waves, into, free, space, at, frequencies, in, the, neighbourhood, of, 94, 5, mhz, megahertz, while, another, radio, station, can, simultaneously, broadcast, radio, waves, at, frequencies, in, the, neighbourhood, of, 96, 1, mhz, each, radio, station, would, transmit, radio, waves, over, a, frequency, bandwidth, of, about, 180, khz, kilohertz, centred, at, frequencies, such, as, the, above, which, are, called, the, carrier, frequencies, each, station, in, this, example, is, separated, from, its, adjacent, stations, by, 200, khz, and, the, difference, between, 200, khz, and, 180, khz, 20, khz, is, an, engineering, allowance, for, the, imperfections, in, the, communication, system, in, the, example, above, the, free, space, channel, has, been, divided, into, communications, channels, according, to, frequencies, and, each, channel, is, assigned, a, separate, frequency, bandwidth, in, which, to, broadcast, radio, waves, this, system, of, dividing, the, medium, into, channels, according, to, frequency, is, called, frequency, division, multiplexing, another, term, for, the, same, concept, is, wavelength, division, multiplexing, which, is, more, commonly, used, in, optical, communications, when, multiple, transmitters, share, the, same, physical, medium, another, way, of, dividing, a, communications, medium, into, channels, is, to, allocate, each, sender, a, recurring, segment, of, time, a, time, slot, for, example, 20, milliseconds, out, of, each, second, and, to, allow, each, sender, to, send, messages, only, within, its, own, time, slot, this, method, of, dividing, the, medium, into, communication, channels, is, called, time, division, multiplexing, tdm, and, is, used, in, optical, fibre, communication, some, radio, communication, systems, use, tdm, within, an, allocated, fdm, channel, hence, these, systems, use, a, hybrid, of, tdm, and, fdm, the, shaping, of, a, signal, to, convey, information, is, known, as, modulation, modulation, can, be, used, to, represent, a, digital, message, as, an, analogue, waveform, this, is, commonly, called, keying, a, term, derived, from, the, older, use, of, morse, code, in, telecommunications, and, several, keying, techniques, exist, these, include, phase, shift, keying, frequency, shift, keying, and, amplitude, shift, keying, the, bluetooth, system, for, example, uses, phase, shift, keying, to, exchange, information, between, various, devices, in, addition, there, are, combinations, of, phase, shift, keying, and, amplitude, shift, keying, which, is, called, in, the, jargon, of, the, field, quadrature, amplitude, modulation, qam, that, are, used, in, high, capacity, digital, radio, communication, systems, modulation, can, also, be, used, to, transmit, the, information, of, low, frequency, analogue, signals, at, higher, frequencies, this, is, helpful, because, low, frequency, analogue, signals, cannot, be, effectively, transmitted, over, free, space, hence, the, information, from, a, low, frequency, analogue, signal, must, be, impressed, into, a, higher, frequency, signal, known, as, the, carrier, wave, before, transmission, there, are, several, different, modulation, schemes, available, to, achieve, this, an, example, of, this, process, is, a, disc, jockey, s, voice, being, impressed, into, a, 96, mhz, carrier, wave, using, frequency, modulation, the, voice, would, then, be, received, on, a, radio, as, the, channel, 96, fm, in, addition, modulation, has, the, advantage, that, it, may, use, frequency, division, multiplexing, fdm, a, telecommunications, network, is, a, collection, of, transmitters, receivers, and, communications, channels, that, send, messages, to, one, another, some, digital, communications, networks, contain, one, or, more, routers, that, work, together, to, transmit, information, to, the, correct, user, an, analogue, communications, network, consists, of, one, or, more, switches, that, establish, a, connection, between, two, or, more, users, for, both, types, of, networks, repeaters, may, be, necessary, to, amplify, or, recreate, the, signal, when, it, is, being, transmitted, over, long, distances, this, is, to, combat, attenuation, that, can, render, the, signal, indistinguishable, from, the, noise, another, advantage, of, digital, systems, over, analogue, is, that, their, output, is, easier, to, store, in, memory, i, e, two, voltage, states, high, and, low, are, easier, to, store, than, a, continuous, range, of, states, telecommunication, has, a, significant, social, cultural, and, economic, impact, on, modern, society, in, 2008, estimates, placed, the, telecommunication, industry, s, revenue, at, us, 4, 7, trillion, or, just, under, three, per, cent, of, the, gross, world, product, official, exchange, rate, several, following, sections, discuss, the, impact, of, telecommunication, on, society, on, the, microeconomic, scale, companies, have, used, telecommunications, to, help, build, global, business, empires, this, is, self, evident, in, the, case, of, online, retailer, amazon, com, but, according, to, academic, edward, lenert, even, the, conventional, retailer, walmart, has, benefited, from, better, telecommunication, infrastructure, compared, to, its, competitors, in, cities, throughout, the, world, home, owners, use, their, telephones, to, order, and, arrange, a, variety, of, home, services, ranging, from, pizza, deliveries, to, electricians, even, relatively, poor, communities, have, been, noted, to, use, telecommunication, to, their, advantage, in, bangladesh, s, narsingdi, district, isolated, villagers, use, cellular, phones, to, speak, directly, to, wholesalers, and, arrange, a, better, price, for, their, goods, in, c, te, d, ivoire, coffee, growers, share, mobile, phones, to, follow, hourly, variations, in, coffee, prices, and, sell, at, the, best, price, on, the, macroeconomic, scale, lars, hendrik, r, ller, and, leonard, waverman, suggested, a, causal, link, between, good, telecommunication, infrastructure, and, economic, growth, few, dispute, the, existence, of, a, correlation, although, some, argue, it, is, wrong, to, view, the, relationship, as, causal, because, of, the, economic, benefits, of, good, telecommunication, infrastructure, there, is, increasing, worry, about, the, inequitable, access, to, telecommunication, services, amongst, various, countries, of, the, world, this, is, known, as, the, digital, divide, a, 2003, survey, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, revealed, that, roughly, a, third, of, countries, have, fewer, than, one, mobile, subscription, for, every, 20, people, and, one, third, of, countries, have, fewer, than, one, land, line, telephone, subscription, for, every, 20, people, in, terms, of, internet, access, roughly, half, of, all, countries, have, fewer, than, one, out, of, 20, people, with, internet, access, from, this, information, as, well, as, educational, data, the, itu, was, able, to, compile, an, index, that, measures, the, overall, ability, of, citizens, to, access, and, use, information, and, communication, technologies, using, this, measure, sweden, denmark, and, iceland, received, the, highest, ranking, while, the, african, countries, niger, burkina, faso, and, mali, received, the, lowest, telecommunication, has, played, a, significant, role, in, social, relationships, nevertheless, devices, like, the, telephone, system, were, originally, advertised, with, an, emphasis, on, the, practical, dimensions, of, the, device, such, as, the, ability, to, conduct, business, or, order, home, services, as, opposed, to, the, social, dimensions, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, that, the, social, dimensions, of, the, device, became, a, prominent, theme, in, telephone, advertisements, new, promotions, started, appealing, to, consumers, emotions, stressing, the, importance, of, social, conversations, and, staying, connected, to, family, and, friends, since, then, the, role, that, telecommunications, has, played, in, social, relations, has, become, increasingly, important, in, recent, years, the, popularity, of, social, networking, sites, has, increased, dramatically, these, sites, allow, users, to, communicate, with, each, other, as, well, as, post, photographs, events, and, profiles, for, others, to, see, the, profiles, can, list, a, person, s, age, interests, sexual, preference, and, relationship, status, in, this, way, these, sites, can, play, important, role, in, everything, from, organising, social, engagements, to, courtship, prior, to, social, networking, sites, technologies, like, short, message, service, sms, and, the, telephone, also, had, a, significant, impact, on, social, interactions, in, 2000, market, research, group, ipsos, mori, reported, that, 81, of, 15, to, 24, year, old, sms, users, in, the, united, kingdom, had, used, the, service, to, coordinate, social, arrangements, and, 42, to, flirt, in, cultural, terms, telecommunication, has, increased, the, public, s, ability, to, access, music, and, film, with, television, people, can, watch, films, they, have, not, seen, before, in, their, own, home, without, having, to, travel, to, the, video, store, or, cinema, with, radio, and, the, internet, people, can, listen, to, music, they, have, not, heard, before, without, having, to, travel, to, the, music, store, telecommunication, has, also, transformed, the, way, people, receive, their, news, a, 2006, survey, right, table, of, slightly, more, than, 3, 000, americans, by, the, non, profit, pew, internet, and, american, life, project, in, the, united, states, the, majority, specified, television, or, radio, over, newspapers, telecommunication, has, had, an, equally, significant, impact, on, advertising, tns, media, intelligence, reported, that, in, 2007, 58, of, advertising, expenditure, in, the, united, states, was, spent, on, media, that, depend, upon, telecommunication, many, countries, have, enacted, legislation, which, conforms, to, the, international, telecommunication, regulations, established, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, which, is, the, leading, un, agency, for, information, and, communication, technology, issues, in, 1947, at, the, atlantic, city, conference, the, itu, decided, to, afford, international, protection, to, all, frequencies, registered, in, a, new, international, frequency, list, and, used, in, conformity, with, the, radio, regulation, according, to, the, itu, s, radio, regulations, adopted, in, atlantic, city, all, frequencies, referenced, in, the, international, frequency, registration, board, examined, by, the, board, and, registered, on, the, international, frequency, list, shall, have, the, right, to, international, protection, from, harmful, interference, from, a, global, perspective, there, have, been, political, debates, and, legislation, regarding, the, management, of, telecommunication, and, broadcasting, the, history, of, broadcasting, discusses, some, debates, in, relation, to, balancing, conventional, communication, such, as, printing, and, telecommunication, such, as, radio, broadcasting, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, brought, on, the, first, explosion, of, international, broadcasting, propaganda, countries, their, governments, insurgents, terrorists, and, militiamen, have, all, used, telecommunication, and, broadcasting, techniques, to, promote, propaganda, patriotic, propaganda, for, political, movements, and, colonization, started, the, mid, 1930s, in, 1936, the, bbc, broadcast, propaganda, to, the, arab, world, to, partly, counter, similar, broadcasts, from, italy, which, also, had, colonial, interests, in, north, africa, modern, political, debates, in, telecommunication, include, the, reclassification, of, broadband, internet, service, as, a, telecommunications, service, also, called, net, neutrality, regulation, of, phone, spam, and, expanding, affordable, broadband, access, according, to, data, collected, by, gartner, and, ars, technica, sales, of, main, consumer, s, telecommunication, equipment, worldwide, in, millions, of, units, was, in, a, telephone, network, the, caller, is, connected, to, the, person, to, whom, they, wish, to, talk, by, switches, at, various, telephone, exchanges, the, switches, form, an, electrical, connection, between, the, two, users, and, the, setting, of, these, switches, is, determined, electronically, when, the, caller, dials, the, number, once, the, connection, is, made, the, caller, s, voice, is, transformed, to, an, electrical, signal, using, a, small, microphone, in, the, caller, s, handset, this, electrical, signal, is, then, sent, through, the, network, to, the, user, at, the, other, end, where, it, is, transformed, back, into, sound, by, a, small, speaker, in, that, person, s, handset, as, of, 2015, the, landline, telephones, in, most, residential, homes, are, analogue, that, is, the, speaker, s, voice, directly, determines, the, signal, s, voltage, although, short, distance, calls, may, be, handled, from, end, to, end, as, analogue, signals, increasingly, telephone, service, providers, are, transparently, converting, the, signals, to, digital, signals, for, transmission, the, advantage, of, this, is, that, digitized, voice, data, can, travel, side, by, side, with, data, from, the, internet, and, can, be, perfectly, reproduced, in, long, distance, communication, as, opposed, to, analogue, signals, that, are, inevitably, impacted, by, noise, mobile, phones, have, had, a, significant, impact, on, telephone, networks, mobile, phone, subscriptions, now, outnumber, fixed, line, subscriptions, in, many, markets, sales, of, mobile, phones, in, 2005, totalled, 816, 6, million, with, that, figure, being, almost, equally, shared, amongst, the, markets, of, asia, pacific, 204, m, western, europe, 164, m, cemea, central, europe, the, middle, east, and, africa, 153, 5, m, north, america, 148, m, and, latin, america, 102, m, in, terms, of, new, subscriptions, over, the, five, years, from, 1999, africa, has, outpaced, other, markets, with, 58, 2, growth, increasingly, these, phones, are, being, serviced, by, systems, where, the, voice, content, is, transmitted, digitally, such, as, gsm, or, w, cdma, with, many, markets, choosing, to, deprecate, analog, systems, such, as, amps, there, have, also, been, dramatic, changes, in, telephone, communication, behind, the, scenes, starting, with, the, operation, of, tat, 8, in, 1988, the, 1990s, saw, the, widespread, adoption, of, systems, based, on, optical, fibres, the, benefit, of, communicating, with, optical, fibres, is, that, they, offer, a, drastic, increase, in, data, capacity, tat, 8, itself, was, able, to, carry, 10, times, as, many, telephone, calls, as, the, last, copper, cable, laid, at, that, time, and, today, s, optical, fibre, cables, are, able, to, carry, 25, times, as, many, telephone, calls, as, tat, 8, this, increase, in, data, capacity, is, due, to, several, factors, first, optical, fibres, are, physically, much, smaller, than, competing, technologies, second, they, do, not, suffer, from, crosstalk, which, means, several, hundred, of, them, can, be, easily, bundled, together, in, a, single, cable, lastly, improvements, in, multiplexing, have, led, to, an, exponential, growth, in, the, data, capacity, of, a, single, fibre, assisting, communication, across, many, modern, optical, fibre, networks, is, a, protocol, known, as, asynchronous, transfer, mode, atm, the, atm, protocol, allows, for, the, side, by, side, data, transmission, mentioned, in, the, second, paragraph, it, is, suitable, for, public, telephone, networks, because, it, establishes, a, pathway, for, data, through, the, network, and, associates, a, traffic, contract, with, that, pathway, the, traffic, contract, is, essentially, an, agreement, between, the, client, and, the, network, about, how, the, network, is, to, handle, the, data, if, the, network, cannot, meet, the, conditions, of, the, traffic, contract, it, does, not, accept, the, connection, this, is, important, because, telephone, calls, can, negotiate, a, contract, so, as, to, guarantee, themselves, a, constant, bit, rate, something, that, will, ensure, a, caller, s, voice, is, not, delayed, in, parts, or, cut, off, completely, there, are, competitors, to, atm, such, as, multiprotocol, label, switching, mpls, that, perform, a, similar, task, and, are, expected, to, supplant, atm, in, the, future, in, a, broadcast, system, the, central, high, powered, broadcast, tower, transmits, a, high, frequency, electromagnetic, wave, to, numerous, low, powered, receivers, the, high, frequency, wave, sent, by, the, tower, is, modulated, with, a, signal, containing, visual, or, audio, information, the, receiver, is, then, tuned, so, as, to, pick, up, the, high, frequency, wave, and, a, demodulator, is, used, to, retrieve, the, signal, containing, the, visual, or, audio, information, the, broadcast, signal, can, be, either, analogue, signal, is, varied, continuously, with, respect, to, the, information, or, digital, information, is, encoded, as, a, set, of, discrete, values, the, broadcast, media, industry, is, at, a, critical, turning, point, in, its, development, with, many, countries, moving, from, analogue, to, digital, broadcasts, this, move, is, made, possible, by, the, production, of, cheaper, faster, and, more, capable, integrated, circuits, the, chief, advantage, of, digital, broadcasts, is, that, they, prevent, a, number, of, complaints, common, to, traditional, analogue, broadcasts, for, television, this, includes, the, elimination, of, problems, such, as, snowy, pictures, ghosting, and, other, distortion, these, occur, because, of, the, nature, of, analogue, transmission, which, means, that, perturbations, due, to, noise, will, be, evident, in, the, final, output, digital, transmission, overcomes, this, problem, because, digital, signals, are, reduced, to, discrete, values, upon, reception, and, hence, small, perturbations, do, not, affect, the, final, output, in, a, simplified, example, if, a, binary, message, 1011, was, transmitted, with, signal, amplitudes, and, received, with, signal, amplitudes, it, would, still, decode, to, the, binary, message, 1011, a, perfect, reproduction, of, what, was, sent, from, this, example, a, problem, with, digital, transmissions, can, also, be, seen, in, that, if, the, noise, is, great, enough, it, can, significantly, alter, the, decoded, message, using, forward, error, correction, a, receiver, can, correct, a, handful, of, bit, errors, in, the, resulting, message, but, too, much, noise, will, lead, to, incomprehensible, output, and, hence, a, breakdown, of, the, transmission, in, digital, television, broadcasting, there, are, three, competing, standards, that, are, likely, to, be, adopted, worldwide, these, are, the, atsc, dvb, and, isdb, standards, the, adoption, of, these, standards, thus, far, is, presented, in, the, captioned, map, all, three, standards, use, mpeg, 2, for, video, compression, atsc, uses, dolby, digital, ac, 3, for, audio, compression, isdb, uses, advanced, audio, coding, mpeg, 2, part, 7, and, dvb, has, no, standard, for, audio, compression, but, typically, uses, mpeg, 1, part, 3, layer, 2, the, choice, of, modulation, also, varies, between, the, schemes, in, digital, audio, broadcasting, standards, are, much, more, unified, with, practically, all, countries, choosing, to, adopt, the, digital, audio, broadcasting, standard, also, known, as, the, eureka, 147, standard, the, exception, is, the, united, states, which, has, chosen, to, adopt, hd, radio, hd, radio, unlike, eureka, 147, is, based, upon, a, transmission, method, known, as, in, band, on, channel, transmission, that, allows, digital, information, to, piggyback, on, normal, am, or, fm, analog, transmissions, however, despite, the, pending, switch, to, digital, analog, television, remains, being, transmitted, in, most, countries, an, exception, is, the, united, states, that, ended, analog, television, transmission, by, all, but, the, very, low, power, tv, stations, on, 12, june, 2009, after, twice, delaying, the, switchover, deadline, kenya, also, ended, analog, television, transmission, in, december, 2014, after, multiple, delays, for, analogue, television, there, were, three, standards, in, use, for, broadcasting, colour, tv, see, a, map, on, adoption, here, these, are, known, as, pal, german, designed, ntsc, american, designed, and, secam, french, designed, for, analogue, radio, the, switch, to, digital, radio, is, made, more, difficult, by, the, higher, cost, of, digital, receivers, the, choice, of, modulation, for, analogue, radio, is, typically, between, amplitude, am, or, frequency, modulation, fm, to, achieve, stereo, playback, an, amplitude, modulated, subcarrier, is, used, for, stereo, fm, and, quadrature, amplitude, modulation, is, used, for, stereo, am, or, c, quam, the, internet, is, a, worldwide, network, of, computers, and, computer, networks, that, communicate, with, each, other, using, the, internet, protocol, ip, any, computer, on, the, internet, has, a, unique, ip, address, that, can, be, used, by, other, computers, to, route, information, to, it, hence, any, computer, on, the, internet, can, send, a, message, to, any, other, computer, using, its, ip, address, these, messages, carry, with, them, the, originating, computer, s, ip, address, allowing, for, two, way, communication, the, internet, is, thus, an, exchange, of, messages, between, computers, it, is, estimated, that, 51, of, the, information, flowing, through, two, way, telecommunications, networks, in, the, year, 2000, were, flowing, through, the, internet, most, of, the, rest, 42, through, the, landline, telephone, by, 2007, the, internet, clearly, dominated, and, captured, 97, of, all, the, information, in, telecommunication, networks, most, of, the, rest, 2, through, mobile, phones, as, of, 2008, an, estimated, 21, 9, of, the, world, population, has, access, to, the, internet, with, the, highest, access, rates, measured, as, a, percentage, of, the, population, in, north, america, 73, 6, oceania, australia, 59, 5, and, europe, 48, 1, in, terms, of, broadband, access, iceland, 26, 7, south, korea, 25, 4, and, the, netherlands, 25, 3, led, the, world, the, internet, works, in, part, because, of, protocols, that, govern, how, the, computers, and, routers, communicate, with, each, other, the, nature, of, computer, network, communication, lends, itself, to, a, layered, approach, where, individual, protocols, in, the, protocol, stack, run, more, or, less, independently, of, other, protocols, this, allows, lower, level, protocols, to, be, customized, for, the, network, situation, while, not, changing, the, way, higher, level, protocols, operate, a, practical, example, of, why, this, is, important, is, because, it, allows, an, internet, browser, to, run, the, same, code, regardless, of, whether, the, computer, it, is, running, on, is, connected, to, the, internet, through, an, ethernet, or, wi, fi, connection, protocols, are, often, talked, about, in, terms, of, their, place, in, the, osi, reference, model, pictured, on, the, right, which, emerged, in, 1983, as, the, first, step, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, build, a, universally, adopted, networking, protocol, suite, for, the, internet, the, physical, medium, and, data, link, protocol, can, vary, several, times, as, packets, traverse, the, globe, this, is, because, the, internet, places, no, constraints, on, what, physical, medium, or, data, link, protocol, is, used, this, leads, to, the, adoption, of, media, and, protocols, that, best, suit, the, local, network, situation, in, practice, most, intercontinental, communication, will, use, the, asynchronous, transfer, mode, atm, protocol, or, a, modern, equivalent, on, top, of, optic, fibre, this, is, because, for, most, intercontinental, communication, the, internet, shares, the, same, infrastructure, as, the, public, switched, telephone, network, at, the, network, layer, things, become, standardized, with, the, internet, protocol, ip, being, adopted, for, logical, addressing, for, the, world, wide, web, these, ip, addresses, are, derived, from, the, human, readable, form, using, the, domain, name, system, e, g, 72, 14, 207, 99, is, derived, from, google, com, at, the, moment, the, most, widely, used, version, of, the, internet, protocol, is, version, four, but, a, move, to, version, six, is, imminent, at, the, transport, layer, most, communication, adopts, either, the, transmission, control, protocol, tcp, or, the, user, datagram, protocol, udp, tcp, is, used, when, it, is, essential, every, message, sent, is, received, by, the, other, computer, whereas, udp, is, used, when, it, is, merely, desirable, with, tcp, packets, are, retransmitted, if, they, are, lost, and, placed, in, order, before, they, are, presented, to, higher, layers, with, udp, packets, are, not, ordered, nor, retransmitted, if, lost, both, tcp, and, udp, packets, carry, port, numbers, with, them, to, specify, what, application, or, process, the, packet, should, be, handled, by, because, certain, application, level, protocols, use, certain, ports, network, administrators, can, manipulate, traffic, to, suit, particular, requirements, examples, are, to, restrict, internet, access, by, blocking, the, traffic, destined, for, a, particular, port, or, to, affect, the, performance, of, certain, applications, by, assigning, priority, above, the, transport, layer, there, are, certain, protocols, that, are, sometimes, used, and, loosely, fit, in, the, session, and, presentation, layers, most, notably, the, secure, sockets, layer, ssl, and, transport, layer, security, tls, protocols, these, protocols, ensure, that, data, transferred, between, two, parties, remains, completely, confidential, finally, at, the, application, layer, are, many, of, the, protocols, internet, users, would, be, familiar, with, such, as, http, web, browsing, pop3, e, mail, ftp, file, transfer, irc, internet, chat, bittorrent, file, sharing, and, xmpp, instant, messaging, voice, over, internet, protocol, voip, allows, data, packets, to, be, used, for, synchronous, voice, communications, the, data, packets, are, marked, as, voice, type, packets, and, can, be, prioritized, by, the, network, administrators, so, that, the, real, time, synchronous, conversation, is, less, subject, to, contention, with, other, types, of, data, traffic, which, can, be, delayed, i, e, file, transfer, or, email, or, buffered, in, advance, i, e, audio, and, video, without, detriment, that, prioritization, is, fine, when, the, network, has, sufficient, capacity, for, all, the, voip, calls, taking, place, at, the, same, time, and, the, network, is, enabled, for, prioritization, i, e, a, private, corporate, style, network, but, the, internet, is, not, generally, managed, in, this, way, and, so, there, can, be, a, big, difference, in, the, quality, of, voip, calls, over, a, private, network, and, over, the, public, internet, despite, the, growth, of, the, internet, the, characteristics, of, local, area, networks, lans, computer, networks, that, do, not, extend, beyond, a, few, kilometres, remain, distinct, this, is, because, networks, on, this, scale, do, not, require, all, the, features, associated, with, larger, networks, and, are, often, more, cost, effective, and, efficient, without, them, when, they, are, not, connected, with, the, internet, they, also, have, the, advantages, of, privacy, and, security, however, purposefully, lacking, a, direct, connection, to, the, internet, does, not, provide, assured, protection, from, hackers, military, forces, or, economic, powers, these, threats, exist, if, there, are, any, methods, for, connecting, remotely, to, the, lan, wide, area, networks, wans, are, private, computer, networks, that, may, extend, for, thousands, of, kilometres, once, again, some, of, their, advantages, include, privacy, and, security, prime, users, of, private, lans, and, wans, include, armed, forces, and, intelligence, agencies, that, must, keep, their, information, secure, and, secret, in, the, mid, 1980s, several, sets, of, communication, protocols, emerged, to, fill, the, gaps, between, the, data, link, layer, and, the, application, layer, of, the, osi, reference, model, these, included, appletalk, ipx, and, netbios, with, the, dominant, protocol, set, during, the, early, 1990s, being, ipx, due, to, its, popularity, with, ms, dos, users, tcp, ip, existed, at, this, point, but, it, was, typically, only, used, by, large, government, and, research, facilities, as, the, internet, grew, in, popularity, and, its, traffic, was, required, to, be, routed, into, private, networks, the, tcp, ip, protocols, replaced, existing, local, area, network, technologies, additional, technologies, such, as, dhcp, allowed, tcp, ip, based, computers, to, self, configure, in, the, network, such, functions, also, existed, in, the, appletalk, ipx, netbios, protocol, sets, whereas, asynchronous, transfer, mode, atm, or, multiprotocol, label, switching, mpls, are, typical, data, link, protocols, for, larger, networks, such, as, wans, ethernet, and, token, ring, are, typical, data, link, protocols, for, lans, these, protocols, differ, from, the, former, protocols, in, that, they, are, simpler, e, g, they, omit, features, such, as, quality, of, service, guarantees, and, offer, medium, access, control, both, of, these, differences, allow, for, more, economical, systems, despite, the, modest, popularity, of, token, ring, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, virtually, all, lans, now, use, either, wired, or, wireless, ethernet, facilities, at, the, physical, layer, most, wired, ethernet, implementations, use, copper, twisted, pair, cables, including, the, common, 10base, t, networks, however, some, early, implementations, used, heavier, coaxial, cables, and, some, recent, implementations, especially, high, speed, ones, use, optical, fibres, when, optic, fibres, are, used, the, distinction, must, be, made, between, multimode, fibres, and, single, mode, fibres, multimode, fibres, can, be, thought, of, as, thicker, optical, fibres, that, are, cheaper, to, manufacture, devices, for, but, that, suffer, from, less, usable, bandwidth, and, worse, attenuation, implying, poorer, long, distance, performance
