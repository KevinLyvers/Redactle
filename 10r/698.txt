a, tram, also, known, as, a, streetcar, or, trolley, in, the, united, states, is, a, type, of, urban, rail, transit, consisting, of, either, individual, railcars, or, self, propelled, multiple, unit, trains, that, run, on, tramway, tracks, on, urban, public, streets, some, include, segments, on, segregated, right, of, way, the, tramlines, or, tram, networks, operated, as, public, transport, are, called, tramways, or, simply, trams, streetcars, due, to, their, close, similarities, trams, are, commonly, included, in, the, wider, term, light, rail, which, also, includes, systems, separated, from, other, traffic, tram, vehicles, are, usually, lighter, and, shorter, than, main, line, and, rapid, transit, trains, most, trams, use, electrical, power, usually, fed, by, a, pantograph, sliding, on, an, overhead, line, older, systems, may, use, a, trolley, pole, or, a, bow, collector, in, some, cases, a, contact, shoe, on, a, third, rail, is, used, if, necessary, they, may, have, dual, power, systems, electricity, in, city, streets, and, diesel, in, more, rural, environments, occasionally, trams, also, carry, freight, some, trams, known, as, tram, trains, may, have, segments, that, run, on, mainline, railway, tracks, similar, to, interurban, systems, the, differences, between, these, modes, of, rail, transport, are, often, indistinct, and, systems, may, combine, multiple, features, one, of, the, advantages, over, earlier, forms, of, transit, was, the, low, rolling, resistance, of, metal, wheels, on, steel, rails, allowing, the, trams, to, haul, a, greater, load, for, a, given, effort, another, factor, which, contributed, to, the, rise, of, trams, was, the, high, total, cost, of, ownership, of, horses, electric, trams, largely, replaced, animal, power, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, improvements, in, other, vehicles, such, as, buses, led, to, decline, of, trams, in, early, to, mid, 20th, century, however, trams, have, seen, resurgence, since, the, 1980s, the, history, of, passenger, trams, streetcars, and, trolley, systems, began, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, it, can, be, divided, into, several, distinct, periods, defined, by, the, principal, means, of, power, used, precursors, to, the, tramway, included, the, wooden, or, stone, wagonways, that, were, used, in, central, europe, to, transport, mine, carts, with, unflanged, wheels, since, the, 1500s, and, the, paved, limestone, trackways, designed, by, the, romans, for, heavy, horse, and, ox, drawn, transportation, by, the, 1700s, paved, plateways, with, cast, iron, rails, were, introduced, in, england, for, transporting, coal, stone, or, iron, ore, from, the, mines, to, the, urban, factories, and, docks, the, world, s, first, passenger, train, or, tram, was, the, swansea, and, mumbles, railway, in, wales, uk, the, british, parliament, passed, the, mumbles, railway, act, in, 1804, and, horse, drawn, service, started, in, 1807, the, service, closed, in, 1827, but, was, restarted, in, 1860, again, using, horses, it, was, worked, by, steam, from, 1877, and, then, from, 1929, by, very, large, 106, seat, electric, tramcars, until, closure, in, 1960, the, swansea, and, mumbles, railway, was, something, of, a, one, off, however, and, no, street, tramway, appeared, in, britain, until, 1860, when, one, was, built, in, birkenhead, by, the, american, george, francis, train, street, railways, developed, in, america, before, europe, due, to, the, poor, paving, of, the, streets, in, american, cities, which, made, them, unsuitable, for, horsebuses, which, were, then, common, on, the, well, paved, streets, of, european, cities, running, the, horsecars, on, rails, allowed, for, a, much, smoother, ride, there, are, records, of, a, street, railway, running, in, baltimore, as, early, as, 1828, however, the, first, authenticated, streetcar, in, america, was, the, new, york, and, harlem, railroad, developed, by, the, irish, coach, builder, john, stephenson, in, new, york, city, which, began, service, in, the, year, 1832, the, new, york, and, harlem, railroad, s, fourth, avenue, line, ran, along, the, bowery, and, fourth, avenue, in, new, york, city, it, was, followed, in, 1835, by, the, new, orleans, and, carrollton, railroad, in, new, orleans, louisiana, which, still, operates, as, the, st, charles, streetcar, line, other, american, cities, did, not, follow, until, the, 1850s, after, which, the, animal, railway, became, an, increasingly, common, feature, in, the, larger, towns, the, first, permanent, tram, line, in, continental, europe, was, opened, in, paris, in, 1855, by, alphonse, loubat, who, had, previously, worked, on, american, streetcar, lines, the, tram, was, developed, in, numerous, cities, of, europe, some, of, the, most, extensive, systems, were, found, in, berlin, budapest, birmingham, saint, petersburg, lisbon, london, manchester, paris, kyiv, the, first, tram, in, south, america, opened, in, 1858, in, santiago, chile, the, first, trams, in, australia, opened, in, 1860, in, sydney, africa, s, first, tram, service, started, in, alexandria, on, 8, january, 1863, the, first, trams, in, asia, opened, in, 1869, in, batavia, jakarta, netherlands, east, indies, indonesia, limitations, of, horsecars, included, the, fact, that, any, given, animal, could, only, work, so, many, hours, on, a, given, day, had, to, be, housed, groomed, fed, and, cared, for, day, in, and, day, out, and, produced, prodigious, amounts, of, manure, which, the, streetcar, company, was, charged, with, storing, and, then, disposing, since, a, typical, horse, pulled, a, streetcar, for, about, a, dozen, miles, a, day, and, worked, for, four, or, five, hours, many, systems, needed, ten, or, more, horses, in, stable, for, each, horsecar, in, 1905, the, british, newspaper, newcastle, daily, chronicle, reported, that, a, large, number, of, london, s, discarded, horse, tramcars, have, been, sent, to, lincolnshire, where, they, are, used, as, sleeping, rooms, for, potato, pickers, horses, continued, to, be, used, for, light, shunting, well, into, the, 20th, century, and, many, large, metropolitan, lines, lasted, into, the, early, 20th, century, new, york, city, had, a, regular, horsecar, service, on, the, bleecker, street, line, until, its, closure, in, 1917, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, had, its, sarah, street, line, drawn, by, horses, until, 1923, the, last, regular, mule, drawn, cars, in, the, us, ran, in, sulphur, rock, arkansas, until, 1926, and, were, commemorated, by, a, u, s, postage, stamp, issued, in, 1983, the, last, mule, tram, service, in, mexico, city, ended, in, 1932, and, a, mule, tram, in, celaya, mexico, survived, until, 1954, the, last, horse, drawn, tram, to, be, withdrawn, from, public, service, in, the, uk, took, passengers, from, fintona, railway, station, to, fintona, junction, one, mile, away, on, the, main, omagh, to, enniskillen, railway, in, northern, ireland, the, tram, made, its, last, journey, on, 30, september, 1957, when, the, omagh, to, enniskillen, line, closed, the, van, is, preserved, at, the, ulster, transport, museum, horse, drawn, trams, still, operate, on, the, 1876, built, douglas, bay, horse, tramway, on, the, isle, of, man, and, at, the, 1894, built, horse, tram, at, victor, harbor, in, south, australia, new, horse, drawn, systems, have, been, established, at, the, hokkaid, museum, in, japan, and, also, in, disneyland, a, horse, tram, route, in, polish, gmina, mrozy, first, built, in, 1902, was, reopened, in, 2012, the, first, mechanical, trams, were, powered, by, steam, generally, there, were, two, types, of, steam, tram, the, first, and, most, common, had, a, small, steam, locomotive, called, a, tram, engine, in, the, uk, at, the, head, of, a, line, of, one, or, more, carriages, similar, to, a, small, train, systems, with, such, steam, trams, included, christchurch, new, zealand, sydney, australia, other, city, systems, in, new, south, wales, munich, germany, from, august, 1883, on, british, india, from, 1885, and, the, dublin, blessington, steam, tramway, from, 1888, in, ireland, steam, tramways, also, were, used, on, the, suburban, tramway, lines, around, milan, and, padua, the, last, gamba, de, legn, peg, leg, tramway, ran, on, the, milan, magenta, castano, primo, route, in, late, 1957, the, other, style, of, steam, tram, had, the, steam, engine, in, the, body, of, the, tram, referred, to, as, a, tram, engine, uk, or, steam, dummy, us, the, most, notable, system, to, adopt, such, trams, was, in, paris, french, designed, steam, trams, also, operated, in, rockhampton, in, the, australian, state, of, queensland, between, 1909, and, 1939, stockholm, sweden, had, a, steam, tram, line, at, the, island, of, s, dermalm, between, 1887, and, 1901, tram, engines, usually, had, modifications, to, make, them, suitable, for, street, running, in, residential, areas, the, wheels, and, other, moving, parts, of, the, machinery, were, usually, enclosed, for, safety, reasons, and, to, make, the, engines, quieter, measures, were, often, taken, to, prevent, the, engines, from, emitting, visible, smoke, or, steam, usually, the, engines, used, coke, rather, than, coal, as, fuel, to, avoid, emitting, smoke, condensers, or, superheating, were, used, to, avoid, emitting, visible, steam, a, major, drawback, of, this, style, of, tram, was, the, limited, space, for, the, engine, so, that, these, trams, were, usually, underpowered, steam, trams, faded, out, around, the, 1890s, to, 1900s, being, replaced, by, electric, trams, another, motive, system, for, trams, was, the, cable, car, which, was, pulled, along, a, fixed, track, by, a, moving, steel, cable, the, cable, usually, running, in, a, slot, below, the, street, level, the, power, to, move, the, cable, was, normally, provided, at, a, powerhouse, site, a, distance, away, from, the, actual, vehicle, the, london, and, blackwall, railway, which, opened, for, passengers, in, east, london, england, in, 1840, used, such, a, system, the, first, practical, cable, car, line, was, tested, in, san, francisco, in, 1873, part, of, its, success, is, attributed, to, the, development, of, an, effective, and, reliable, cable, grip, mechanism, to, grab, and, release, the, moving, cable, without, damage, the, second, city, to, operate, cable, trams, was, dunedin, from, 1881, to, 1957, the, most, extensive, cable, system, in, the, us, was, built, in, chicago, in, stages, between, 1859, and, 1892, new, york, city, developed, multiple, cable, car, lines, that, operated, from, 1883, to, 1909, los, angeles, also, had, several, cable, car, lines, including, the, second, street, cable, railroad, which, operated, from, 1885, to, 1889, and, the, temple, street, cable, railway, which, operated, from, 1886, to, 1898, from, 1885, to, 1940, the, city, of, melbourne, victoria, australia, operated, one, of, the, largest, cable, systems, in, the, world, at, its, peak, running, 592, trams, on, 75, kilometres, 47, mi, of, track, there, were, also, two, isolated, cable, lines, in, sydney, new, south, wales, australia, the, north, sydney, line, from, 1886, to, 1900, and, the, king, street, line, from, 1892, to, 1905, in, dresden, germany, in, 1901, an, elevated, suspended, cable, car, following, the, eugen, langen, one, railed, floating, tram, system, started, operating, cable, cars, operated, on, highgate, hill, in, north, london, and, kennington, to, brixton, hill, in, south, london, they, also, worked, around, upper, douglas, in, the, isle, of, man, from, 1897, to, 1929, cable, car, 72, 73, is, the, sole, survivor, of, the, fleet, in, italy, in, trieste, the, trieste, opicina, tramway, was, opened, in, 1902, with, the, steepest, section, of, the, route, being, negotiated, with, the, help, of, a, funicular, and, its, cables, cable, cars, suffered, from, high, infrastructure, costs, since, an, expensive, system, of, cables, pulleys, stationary, engines, and, lengthy, underground, vault, structures, beneath, the, rails, had, to, be, provided, they, also, required, physical, strength, and, skill, to, operate, and, alert, operators, to, avoid, obstructions, and, other, cable, cars, the, cable, had, to, be, disconnected, dropped, at, designated, locations, to, allow, the, cars, to, coast, by, inertia, for, example, when, crossing, another, cable, line, the, cable, then, had, to, be, picked, up, to, resume, progress, the, whole, operation, requiring, precise, timing, to, avoid, damage, to, the, cable, and, the, grip, mechanism, breaks, and, frays, in, the, cable, which, occurred, frequently, required, the, complete, cessation, of, services, over, a, cable, route, while, the, cable, was, repaired, due, to, overall, wear, the, entire, length, of, cable, typically, several, kilometres, had, to, be, replaced, on, a, regular, schedule, after, the, development, of, reliable, electrically, powered, trams, the, costly, high, maintenance, cable, car, systems, were, rapidly, replaced, in, most, locations, cable, cars, remained, especially, effective, in, hilly, cities, since, their, nondriven, wheels, did, not, lose, traction, as, they, climbed, or, descended, a, steep, hill, the, moving, cable, pulled, the, car, up, the, hill, at, a, steady, pace, unlike, a, low, powered, steam, or, horse, drawn, car, cable, cars, do, have, wheel, brakes, and, track, brakes, but, the, cable, also, helps, restrain, the, car, to, going, downhill, at, a, constant, speed, performance, in, steep, terrain, partially, explains, the, survival, of, cable, cars, in, san, francisco, the, san, francisco, cable, cars, though, significantly, reduced, in, number, continue, to, provide, regular, transportation, service, in, addition, to, being, a, well, known, tourist, attraction, a, single, cable, line, also, survives, in, wellington, rebuilt, in, 1979, as, a, funicular, but, still, called, the, wellington, cable, car, another, system, with, two, separate, cable, lines, and, a, shared, power, station, in, the, middle, operates, from, the, welsh, town, of, llandudno, up, to, the, top, of, the, great, orme, hill, in, north, wales, uk, hastings, and, some, other, tramways, for, example, stockholms, sp, rv, gar, in, sweden, and, some, lines, in, karachi, used, petrol, trams, galveston, island, trolley, in, texas, operated, diesel, trams, due, to, the, city, s, hurricane, prone, location, which, would, have, resulted, in, frequent, damage, to, an, electrical, supply, system, although, portland, victoria, promotes, its, tourist, tram, as, being, a, cable, car, it, actually, operates, using, a, diesel, motor, the, tram, which, runs, on, a, circular, route, around, the, town, of, portland, uses, dummies, and, salons, formerly, used, on, the, melbourne, cable, tramway, system, and, since, restored, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, a, number, of, systems, in, various, parts, of, the, world, employed, trams, powered, by, gas, naphtha, gas, or, coal, gas, in, particular, gas, trams, are, known, to, have, operated, between, alphington, and, clifton, hill, in, the, northern, suburbs, of, melbourne, australia, 1886, 1888, in, berlin, and, dresden, germany, in, estonia, 1921, 1951, between, jelenia, g, ra, cieplice, and, sobiesz, w, in, poland, from, 1897, and, in, the, uk, at, lytham, st, annes, trafford, park, manchester, 1897, 1908, and, neath, wales, 1896, 1920, comparatively, little, has, been, published, about, gas, trams, however, research, on, the, subject, was, carried, out, for, an, article, in, the, october, 2011, edition, of, the, times, the, historical, journal, of, the, australian, association, of, timetable, collectors, later, renamed, the, australian, timetable, association, the, world, s, first, electric, tram, line, operated, in, sestroretsk, near, saint, petersburg, invented, and, tested, by, inventor, fyodor, pirotsky, in, 1875, later, using, a, similar, technology, pirotsky, put, into, service, the, first, public, electric, tramway, in, st, petersburg, which, operated, only, during, september, 1880, the, second, demonstration, tramway, was, presented, by, siemens, halske, at, the, 1879, berlin, industrial, exposition, the, first, public, electric, tramway, used, for, permanent, service, was, the, gross, lichterfelde, tramway, in, lichterfelde, near, berlin, in, germany, which, opened, in, 1881, it, was, built, by, werner, von, siemens, who, contacted, pirotsky, this, was, the, world, s, first, commercially, successful, electric, tram, it, drew, current, from, the, rails, at, first, with, overhead, wire, being, installed, in, 1883, in, britain, volk, s, electric, railway, was, opened, in, 1883, in, brighton, this, two, kilometer, line, along, the, seafront, re, gauged, to, 2, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, 825, mm, in, 1884, remains, in, service, as, the, oldest, operating, electric, tramway, in, the, world, also, in, 1883, m, dling, and, hinterbr, hl, tram, was, opened, near, vienna, in, austria, it, was, the, first, tram, in, the, world, in, regular, service, that, was, run, with, electricity, served, by, an, overhead, line, with, pantograph, current, collectors, the, blackpool, tramway, was, opened, in, blackpool, uk, on, 29, september, 1885, using, conduit, collection, along, blackpool, promenade, this, system, is, still, in, operation, in, modernised, form, the, earliest, tram, system, in, canada, was, built, by, john, joseph, wright, brother, of, the, famous, mining, entrepreneur, whitaker, wright, in, toronto, in, 1883, introducing, electric, trams, in, 1892, in, the, us, multiple, experimental, electric, trams, were, exhibited, at, the, 1884, world, cotton, centennial, world, s, fair, in, new, orleans, louisiana, but, they, were, not, deemed, good, enough, to, replace, the, lamm, fireless, engines, then, propelling, the, st, charles, avenue, streetcar, in, that, city, the, first, commercial, installation, of, an, electric, streetcar, in, the, united, states, was, built, in, 1884, in, cleveland, ohio, and, operated, for, a, period, of, one, year, by, the, east, cleveland, street, railway, company, the, first, city, wide, electric, streetcar, system, was, implemented, in, 1886, in, montgomery, alabama, by, the, capital, city, street, railway, company, and, ran, for, 50, years, in, 1888, the, richmond, union, passenger, railway, began, to, operate, trams, in, richmond, virginia, that, frank, j, sprague, had, built, sprague, later, developed, multiple, unit, control, first, demonstrated, in, chicago, in, 1897, allowing, multiple, cars, to, be, coupled, together, and, operated, by, a, single, motorman, this, gave, rise, to, the, modern, subway, train, following, the, improvement, of, an, overhead, trolley, system, on, streetcars, for, collecting, electricity, from, overhead, wires, by, sprague, electric, tram, systems, were, rapidly, adopted, across, the, world, earlier, electric, trains, proved, difficult, or, unreliable, and, experienced, limited, success, until, the, second, half, of, the, 1880s, when, new, types, of, current, collectors, were, developed, siemens, line, for, example, provided, power, through, a, live, rail, and, a, return, rail, like, a, model, train, limiting, the, voltage, that, could, be, used, and, delivering, electric, shocks, to, people, and, animals, crossing, the, tracks, siemens, later, designed, his, own, version, of, overhead, current, collection, called, the, bow, collector, one, of, the, first, systems, to, use, it, was, in, thorold, ontario, opened, in, 1887, and, it, was, considered, quite, successful, while, this, line, proved, quite, versatile, as, one, of, the, earliest, fully, functional, electric, streetcar, installations, it, required, horse, drawn, support, while, climbing, the, niagara, escarpment, and, for, two, months, of, the, winter, when, hydroelectricity, was, not, available, it, continued, in, service, in, its, original, form, into, the, 1950s, sidney, howe, short, designed, and, produced, the, first, electric, motor, that, operated, a, streetcar, without, gears, the, motor, had, its, armature, direct, connected, to, the, streetcar, s, axle, for, the, driving, force, short, pioneered, use, of, a, conduit, system, of, concealed, feed, thereby, eliminating, the, necessity, of, overhead, wire, and, a, trolley, pole, for, street, cars, and, railways, while, at, the, university, of, denver, he, conducted, experiments, which, established, that, multiple, unit, powered, cars, were, a, better, way, to, operate, trains, and, trolleys, electric, tramways, spread, to, many, european, cities, in, the, 1890s, such, as, sarajevo, built, a, citywide, system, of, electric, trams, in, 1895, budapest, established, its, tramway, system, in, 1887, and, its, ring, line, has, grown, to, be, the, busiest, tram, line, in, europe, with, a, tram, running, once, per, minute, at, rush, hour, bucharest, and, belgrade, ran, a, regular, service, from, 1894, ljubljana, introduced, its, tram, system, in, 1901, it, closed, in, 1958, oslo, had, the, first, tramway, in, scandinavia, starting, operation, on, 2, march, 1894, the, first, electric, tramway, in, australia, was, a, sprague, system, demonstrated, at, the, 1888, melbourne, centennial, exhibition, in, melbourne, afterwards, this, was, installed, as, a, commercial, venture, operating, between, the, outer, melbourne, suburb, of, box, hill, and, the, then, tourist, oriented, country, town, doncaster, from, 1889, to, 1896, electric, systems, were, also, built, in, adelaide, ballarat, bendigo, brisbane, fremantle, geelong, hobart, kalgoorlie, launceston, leonora, newcastle, perth, and, sydney, by, the, 1970s, the, only, full, tramway, system, remaining, in, australia, was, the, melbourne, tram, system, however, there, were, also, a, few, single, lines, remaining, elsewhere, the, glenelg, tram, line, connecting, adelaide, to, the, beachside, suburb, of, glenelg, and, tourist, trams, in, the, victorian, goldfields, cities, of, bendigo, and, ballarat, in, recent, years, the, melbourne, system, generally, recognised, as, the, largest, urban, tram, network, in, the, world, has, been, considerably, modernised, and, expanded, the, adelaide, line, has, been, extended, to, the, entertainment, centre, and, work, is, progressing, on, further, extensions, sydney, re, introduced, trams, or, light, rail, on, 31, august, 1997, a, completely, new, system, known, as, g, link, was, introduced, on, the, gold, coast, queensland, on, 20, july, 2014, the, newcastle, light, rail, opened, in, february, 2019, while, the, canberra, light, rail, opened, on, 20, april, 2019, this, is, the, first, time, that, there, have, been, trams, in, canberra, even, though, walter, burley, griffin, s, 1914, 1920, plans, for, the, capital, then, in, the, planning, stage, did, propose, a, canberra, tram, system, in, japan, the, kyoto, electric, railroad, was, the, first, tram, system, starting, operation, in, 1895, by, 1932, the, network, had, grown, to, 82, railway, companies, in, 65, cities, with, a, total, network, length, of, 1, 479, km, 919, mi, by, the, 1960s, the, tram, had, generally, died, out, in, japan, two, rare, but, significant, alternatives, were, conduit, current, collection, which, was, widely, used, in, london, washington, d, c, and, new, york, city, and, the, surface, contact, collection, method, used, in, wolverhampton, the, lorain, system, torquay, and, hastings, in, the, uk, the, dolter, stud, system, and, in, bordeaux, france, the, ground, level, power, supply, system, the, convenience, and, economy, of, electricity, resulted, in, its, rapid, adoption, once, the, technical, problems, of, production, and, transmission, of, electricity, were, solved, electric, trams, largely, replaced, animal, power, and, other, forms, of, motive, power, including, cable, and, steam, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, there, was, one, particular, hazard, associated, with, trams, powered, from, a, trolley, pole, off, an, overhead, line, on, the, early, electrified, systems, since, the, tram, relies, on, contact, with, the, rails, for, the, current, return, path, a, problem, arises, if, the, tram, is, derailed, or, more, usually, if, it, halts, on, a, section, of, track, that, has, been, heavily, sanded, by, a, previous, tram, and, the, tram, loses, electrical, contact, with, the, rails, in, this, event, the, underframe, of, the, tram, by, virtue, of, a, circuit, path, through, ancillary, loads, such, as, interior, lighting, is, live, at, the, full, supply, voltage, typically, 600, volts, dc, in, british, terminology, such, a, tram, was, said, to, be, grounded, not, to, be, confused, with, the, us, english, use, of, the, term, which, means, the, exact, opposite, any, person, stepping, off, the, tram, and, completing, the, earth, return, circuit, with, their, body, could, receive, a, serious, electric, shock, if, grounded, the, driver, was, required, to, jump, off, the, tram, avoiding, simultaneous, contact, with, the, tram, and, the, ground, and, pull, down, the, trolley, pole, before, allowing, passengers, off, the, tram, unless, derailed, the, tram, could, usually, be, recovered, by, running, water, down, the, running, rails, from, a, point, higher, than, the, tram, the, water, providing, a, conducting, bridge, between, the, tram, and, the, rails, with, improved, technology, this, ceased, to, be, an, problem, in, the, 2000s, several, companies, introduced, catenary, free, designs, alstom, s, citadis, line, uses, a, third, rail, bombardier, s, primove, lrv, is, charged, by, contactless, induction, plates, embedded, in, the, trackway, and, caf, urbos, tram, uses, ultracaps, technology, as, early, as, 1834, thomas, davenport, a, vermont, blacksmith, had, invented, a, battery, powered, electric, motor, which, he, later, patented, the, following, year, he, used, it, to, operate, a, small, model, electric, car, on, a, short, section, of, track, four, feet, in, diameter, attempts, to, use, batteries, as, a, source, of, electricity, were, made, from, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, with, unsuccessful, trials, conducted, in, among, other, places, bendigo, and, adelaide, in, australia, and, for, about, 14, years, as, the, hague, accutram, of, htm, in, the, netherlands, the, first, trams, in, bendigo, australia, in, 1892, were, battery, powered, but, within, as, little, as, three, months, they, were, replaced, with, horse, drawn, trams, in, new, york, city, some, minor, lines, also, used, storage, batteries, then, more, recently, during, the, 1950s, a, longer, battery, operated, tramway, line, ran, from, milan, to, bergamo, in, china, there, is, a, nanjing, battery, tram, line, and, has, been, running, since, 2014, in, 2019, the, west, midlands, metro, in, birmingham, england, adopted, battery, powered, trams, on, sections, through, the, city, centre, close, to, grade, i, listed, birmingham, town, hall, paris, and, berne, switzerland, operated, trams, that, were, powered, by, compressed, air, using, the, mekarski, system, trials, on, street, tramways, in, britain, including, by, the, north, metropolitan, tramway, company, between, kings, cross, and, holloway, london, 1883, achieved, acceptable, results, but, were, found, not, to, be, economic, because, of, the, combined, coal, consumption, of, the, stationary, compressor, and, the, onboard, steam, boiler, the, convict, tramway, was, hauled, by, human, power, in, the, form, of, convicts, from, the, port, arthur, convict, settlement, and, was, created, to, replace, the, hazardous, sea, voyage, from, hobart, to, port, arthur, tasmania, charles, o, hara, booth, oversaw, the, construction, of, the, tramway, it, opened, in, 1836, and, ran, for, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, from, oakwood, to, taranna, by, most, definitions, the, tramway, was, the, first, passenger, carrying, railway, tramway, in, australia, an, unconfirmed, report, says, that, it, continued, to, eaglehawk, neck, and, if, this, was, so, the, length, of, the, tramway, would, have, been, more, than, doubled, the, tramway, carried, passengers, and, freight, and, ran, on, wooden, rails, the, gauge, is, unknown, the, date, of, closure, is, unknown, but, it, was, certainly, prior, to, 1877, in, march, 2015, china, south, rail, corporation, csr, demonstrated, the, world, s, first, hydrogen, fuel, cell, vehicle, tramcar, at, an, assembly, facility, in, qingdao, the, chief, engineer, of, the, csr, subsidiary, csr, sifang, co, ltd, liang, jianying, said, that, the, company, is, studying, how, to, reduce, the, running, costs, of, the, tram, the, trieste, opicina, tramway, in, trieste, operates, a, hybrid, funicular, tramway, system, conventional, electric, trams, are, operated, in, street, running, and, on, reserved, track, for, most, of, their, route, however, on, one, steep, segment, of, track, they, are, assisted, by, cable, tractors, which, push, the, trams, uphill, and, act, as, brakes, for, the, downhill, run, for, safety, the, cable, tractors, are, always, deployed, on, the, downhill, side, of, the, tram, vehicle, similar, systems, were, used, elsewhere, in, the, past, notably, on, the, queen, anne, counterbalance, in, seattle, and, the, darling, street, wharf, line, in, sydney, in, the, mid, 20th, century, many, tram, systems, were, disbanded, replaced, by, buses, trolleybuses, automobiles, or, rapid, transit, the, general, motors, streetcar, conspiracy, was, a, case, study, of, the, decline, of, trams, in, the, united, states, in, the, 21st, century, trams, have, been, re, introduced, in, cities, where, they, had, been, closed, down, for, decades, such, as, tramlink, in, london, or, kept, in, heritage, use, such, as, sp, rv, g, city, in, stockholm, most, trams, made, since, the, 1990s, such, as, the, bombardier, flexity, series, and, alstom, citadis, are, articulated, low, floor, trams, with, features, such, as, regenerative, braking, trams, have, been, used, for, two, main, purposes, for, carrying, passengers, and, for, carrying, cargo, there, are, several, types, of, passenger, tram, there, are, two, main, types, of, tramways, the, classic, tramway, built, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, tram, system, operating, in, mixed, traffic, and, the, later, type, which, is, most, often, associated, with, the, tram, system, having, its, own, right, of, way, tram, systems, that, have, their, own, right, of, way, are, often, called, light, rail, but, this, does, not, always, hold, true, though, these, two, systems, differ, in, their, operation, their, equipment, is, much, the, same, trams, were, traditionally, operated, with, separate, levers, for, applying, power, and, brakes, more, modern, vehicles, use, a, locomotive, style, controller, which, incorporate, a, dead, man, s, switch, the, success, of, the, pcc, streetcar, had, also, seen, trams, use, automobile, style, foot, controls, allowing, hands, free, operation, particularly, when, the, driver, was, responsible, for, fare, collection, electric, trams, use, various, devices, to, collect, power, from, overhead, lines, the, most, common, device, is, the, pantograph, while, some, older, systems, use, trolley, poles, or, bow, collectors, ground, level, power, supply, has, become, a, more, recent, innovation, another, technology, uses, supercapacitors, when, an, insulator, at, a, track, switch, cuts, off, power, from, the, tram, for, a, short, distance, along, the, line, the, tram, can, use, energy, stored, in, a, large, capacitor, to, drive, the, tram, past, the, gap, in, the, power, feed, the, old, tram, systems, in, london, manhattan, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, used, live, rails, like, those, on, third, rail, electrified, railways, but, in, a, conduit, underneath, the, road, from, which, they, drew, power, through, a, plough, it, was, called, conduit, current, collection, washington, s, was, the, last, of, these, to, close, in, 1962, no, commercial, tramway, uses, this, system, anymore, more, recently, an, equivalent, to, these, systems, has, been, developed, which, allows, for, the, safe, installation, of, a, third, rail, on, city, streets, known, as, surface, current, collection, or, ground, level, power, supply, the, main, example, of, this, is, the, new, tramway, in, bordeaux, a, ground, level, power, supply, system, also, called, surface, current, collection, or, alimentation, par, le, sol, aps, is, an, updated, version, of, the, original, stud, type, system, aps, uses, a, third, rail, placed, between, the, running, rails, divided, electrically, into, eight, metre, powered, segments, with, three, metre, neutral, sections, between, each, tram, has, two, power, collection, skates, next, to, which, are, antennas, that, send, radio, signals, to, energize, the, power, rail, segments, as, the, tram, passes, over, them, older, systems, required, mechanical, switching, systems, which, were, susceptible, to, environmental, problems, at, any, one, time, no, more, than, two, consecutive, segments, under, the, tram, should, be, live, wireless, and, solid, state, switching, eliminate, mechanical, problems, alstom, developed, the, system, primarily, to, avoid, intrusive, power, supply, cables, in, the, sensitive, area, of, the, old, city, of, old, bordeaux, route, patterns, vary, greatly, among, the, world, s, tram, systems, leading, to, different, network, topologies, the, resulting, route, patterns, are, very, different, some, have, a, rational, structure, covering, their, catchment, area, as, efficiently, as, possible, with, new, suburbs, being, planned, with, tramlines, integral, to, their, layout, such, is, the, case, in, amsterdam, bordeaux, and, montpellier, have, built, comprehensive, networks, based, on, radial, routes, with, numerous, interconnections, within, the, last, two, decades, some, systems, serve, only, parts, of, their, cities, with, berlin, being, the, prime, example, as, trams, survived, the, city, s, political, division, only, in, the, eastern, part, other, systems, have, ended, up, with, a, rather, random, route, map, for, instance, when, some, previous, operating, companies, have, ceased, operation, as, with, the, tramways, vicinaux, buurtspoorwegen, in, brussels, or, where, isolated, outlying, lines, have, been, preserved, as, on, the, eastern, fringe, of, berlin, in, rome, the, remnant, of, the, system, comprises, three, isolated, radial, routes, not, connecting, in, the, ancient, city, centre, but, linked, by, a, ring, route, some, apparently, anomalous, lines, continue, in, operation, where, a, new, line, would, not, on, rational, grounds, be, built, because, it, is, much, more, costly, to, build, a, new, line, than, to, continue, operating, an, existing, one, in, some, places, the, opportunity, is, taken, when, roads, are, being, repaved, to, lay, tramlines, though, without, erecting, overhead, cables, even, though, no, service, is, immediately, planned, such, is, the, case, in, leipzigerstra, e, in, berlin, the, haarlemmer, houttuinen, in, amsterdam, and, botermarkt, in, ghent, tram, systems, operate, across, national, borders, in, basel, from, switzerland, into, france, and, germany, geneva, from, switzerland, into, france, and, strasbourg, from, france, into, germany, a, planned, line, linking, hasselt, belgium, with, maastricht, netherlands, was, cancelled, in, june, 2022, where, tracks, diverge, the, driver, chooses, the, route, usually, either, by, flicking, a, switch, on, the, dashboard, or, by, use, of, the, power, pedal, generally, if, power, is, applied, the, tram, goes, straight, on, whereas, if, no, power, is, applied, the, tram, turns, some, systems, use, automatic, point, setting, systems, where, the, route, for, each, journey, is, downloaded, from, a, central, computer, and, an, onboard, computer, actuates, each, point, as, it, comes, to, it, via, an, induction, loop, such, is, the, case, at, manchester, metrolink, if, the, powered, system, breaks, down, most, points, may, be, operated, manually, by, inserting, a, metal, lever, point, iron, into, the, point, machine, tramway, track, can, have, different, rail, profiles, to, accommodate, the, various, operating, environments, of, the, vehicle, they, may, be, embedded, into, concrete, for, street, running, operation, or, use, standard, ballasted, track, with, railroad, ties, on, high, speed, sections, a, more, ecological, solution, is, to, embed, tracks, into, grass, turf, an, approach, known, as, green, track, tramway, tracks, use, a, grooved, rail, with, a, groove, designed, for, tramway, or, railway, track, in, pavement, or, grassed, surfaces, grassed, track, or, track, in, a, lawn, the, rail, has, the, railhead, on, one, side, and, the, guard, on, the, other, the, guard, provides, accommodation, for, the, flange, the, guard, carries, no, weight, but, may, act, as, a, checkrail, grooved, rail, was, invented, in, 1852, by, alphonse, loubat, a, french, inventor, who, developed, improvements, in, tram, and, rail, equipment, and, helped, develop, tram, lines, in, new, york, city, and, paris, the, invention, of, grooved, rail, enabled, tramways, to, be, laid, without, causing, a, nuisance, to, other, road, users, except, unsuspecting, cyclists, who, could, get, their, wheels, caught, in, the, groove, the, grooves, may, become, filled, with, gravel, and, dirt, particularly, if, infrequently, used, or, after, a, period, of, idleness, and, need, clearing, from, time, to, time, this, being, done, by, a, scrubber, tram, failure, to, clear, the, grooves, can, lead, to, a, bumpy, ride, for, the, passengers, damage, to, either, wheel, or, rail, and, possibly, derailing, in, narrow, situations, double, track, tram, lines, sometimes, reduce, to, single, track, or, to, avoid, switches, have, the, tracks, interlaced, e, g, in, the, leidsestraat, in, amsterdam, on, three, short, stretches, see, map, detail, this, is, known, as, interlaced, or, gauntlet, track, there, is, a, uk, example, of, interlaced, track, on, the, tramlink, just, west, of, mitcham, station, where, the, formation, is, narrowed, by, an, old, landslip, causing, an, obstruction, see, photo, in, tramlink, entry, historically, the, track, gauge, has, had, considerable, variations, with, narrow, gauge, common, in, many, early, systems, however, most, light, rail, systems, are, now, standard, gauge, an, important, advantage, of, standard, gauge, is, that, standard, railway, maintenance, equipment, can, be, used, on, it, rather, than, custom, built, machinery, using, standard, gauge, also, allows, light, rail, vehicles, to, be, delivered, and, relocated, conveniently, using, freight, railways, and, locomotives, another, factor, favoring, standard, gauge, is, that, low, floor, vehicles, are, becoming, popular, and, there, is, generally, insufficient, space, for, wheelchairs, to, move, between, the, wheels, in, a, narrow, gauge, layout, standard, gauge, also, enables, at, least, in, theory, a, larger, choice, of, manufacturers, and, thus, lower, procurement, costs, for, new, vehicles, however, other, factors, such, as, electrification, or, loading, gauge, for, which, there, is, more, variation, may, require, costly, custom, built, units, regardless, tram, stops, may, be, similar, to, bus, stops, in, design, and, use, particularly, in, street, running, sections, where, in, some, cases, other, vehicles, are, legally, required, to, stop, clear, of, the, tram, doors, some, stops, may, have, railway, platforms, particularly, in, private, right, of, way, sections, and, where, trams, are, boarded, at, standard, railway, platform, height, as, opposed, to, using, steps, at, the, doorway, or, low, floor, trams, approximately, 5, 000, new, trams, are, manufactured, each, year, as, of, february, 2017, 4, 478, new, trams, were, on, order, from, their, makers, with, options, being, open, for, a, further, 1, 092, the, main, manufacturers, are, trams, are, in, a, period, of, growth, with, about, 800, tram, systems, operating, around, the, world, 10, or, so, new, systems, being, opened, each, year, and, many, being, gradually, extended, some, of, these, systems, date, from, the, late, 19th, or, early, 20th, centuries, in, the, past, 20, years, their, numbers, have, been, augmented, by, modern, tramway, or, light, rail, systems, in, cities, that, had, abandoned, this, form, of, transport, there, have, also, been, some, new, tram, systems, in, cities, that, never, previously, had, them, tramways, with, tramcars, british, english, or, street, railways, with, streetcars, north, american, english, were, common, throughout, the, industrialised, world, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, but, they, had, disappeared, from, most, british, canadian, french, and, us, cities, by, the, mid, 20th, century, by, contrast, trams, in, parts, of, continental, europe, continued, to, be, used, by, many, cities, although, there, were, declines, in, some, countries, including, the, netherlands, since, 1980, trams, have, returned, to, favour, in, many, places, partly, because, their, tendency, to, dominate, the, roadway, formerly, seen, as, a, disadvantage, is, considered, to, be, a, merit, since, it, raises, the, visibility, of, public, transport, encouraging, car, users, to, change, their, mode, of, travel, and, enables, streets, to, be, reconfigured, to, give, more, space, to, pedestrians, making, cites, more, pleasant, places, to, live, new, systems, have, been, built, in, the, united, states, united, kingdom, ireland, italy, france, australia, and, many, other, countries, in, milan, italy, the, old, ventotto, trams, are, considered, a, symbol, of, the, city, the, same, can, be, said, of, trams, in, melbourne, in, general, but, particularly, the, iconic, w, class, the, toronto, streetcar, system, had, similarly, become, an, iconic, symbol, of, the, city, operating, the, largest, network, in, the, americas, as, well, as, the, only, large, scale, tram, system, in, canada, not, including, light, rail, systems, or, heritage, lines, the, largest, tram, classic, tram, streetcar, stra, enbahn, and, fast, tram, light, rail, stadtbahn, networks, in, the, world, by, route, length, as, of, 2016, are, other, large, transit, networks, that, operate, streetcar, and, light, rail, systems, include, historically, the, paris, tram, system, was, at, its, peak, the, world, s, largest, system, with, 1, 111, km, 690, mi, of, track, in, 1925, according, to, other, sources, ca, 640, km, 400, mi, of, route, length, in, 1930, however, it, was, completely, closed, in, 1938, the, next, largest, system, appears, to, have, been, 857, km, 533, mi, in, buenos, aires, before, 19, february, 1963, the, third, largest, was, chicago, with, over, 850, km, 530, mi, of, track, but, it, was, all, converted, to, trolleybus, and, bus, services, by, 21, june, 1958, before, its, decline, the, bvg, in, berlin, operated, a, very, large, network, with, 634, km, 394, mi, of, route, before, its, system, was, converted, to, trolleybus, and, later, bus, services, in, the, 1930s, last, tramway, closed, 6, july, 1952, the, first, generation, london, network, had, 555, km, 345, mi, of, route, in, 1931, in, 1958, trams, in, rio, de, jainero, were, employed, on, 433, km, 269, mi, of, track, the, final, line, the, santa, teresa, route, was, closed, in, 1968, during, a, period, in, the, 1980s, the, world, s, largest, tram, system, was, in, leningrad, st, petersburg, with, 350, km, 220, mi, ussr, and, was, included, as, such, in, the, guinness, world, records, however, saint, petersburg, s, tram, system, has, declined, in, size, since, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, vienna, in, 1960, had, 340, km, 211, mi, before, the, expansion, of, bus, services, and, the, opening, of, a, subway, 1976, substituting, subway, services, for, tram, routes, continues, 320, km, 199, mi, was, in, minneapolis, saint, paul, in, 1947, there, streetcars, ended, 31, october, 1953, in, minneapolis, and, 19, june, 1954, in, st, paul, the, sydney, tram, network, before, it, was, closed, on, 25, february, 1961, had, 291, km, 181, mi, of, route, and, was, thus, the, largest, in, australia, since, 1961, the, melbourne, system, recognised, as, the, world, s, largest, assumed, sydney, s, title, as, the, largest, network, in, australia, urban, public, transportation, has, been, experiencing, a, sustained, revival, since, the, 1990s, many, european, cities, are, rehabilitating, upgrading, expanding, and, reconstructing, their, old, tramway, lines, and, building, new, tramway, lines, in, 2014, the, aubagne, tramway, in, southern, france, became, the, first, tram, system, in, the, world, not, to, charge, fares, in, many, european, cities, tramway, infrastructure, was, lost, during, the, mid, 20th, century, though, not, always, on, the, same, scale, as, in, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, north, america, most, of, central, and, eastern, europe, retained, the, majority, of, its, tramway, systems, and, it, is, here, that, the, largest, and, busiest, tram, systems, in, the, world, are, found, germany, and, france, have, the, most, tram, systems, with, over, 50, and, over, 30, networks, in, the, uk, most, of, the, old, victorian, era, tramways, were, decommissioned, from, the, 1950s, 70s, and, replaced, by, buses, the, exceptions, were, blackpool, tramway, opened, in, 1885, and, one, of, the, few, tramways, to, use, double, decker, trams, in, the, 21st, century, and, great, orme, tramway, which, has, operated, at, llandudno, since, 1902, since, the, early, 2000s, tramways, have, been, restored, in, many, cities, to, reduce, commuters, dependency, on, cars, these, include, edinburgh, tramway, manchester, metrolink, and, nottingham, tramway, many, decommissioned, trams, are, preserved, at, transport, museums, and, heritage, railways, the, first, of, these, was, seaton, tramway, which, opened, in, 1971, but, dates, back, to, 1949, other, preserved, tramways, include, crich, tramway, opened, 1963, east, anglia, transport, museum, opened, 1965, heaton, tramway, opened, 1979, telford, steam, tram, opened, 1980, and, wirral, tramway, opened, 1995, additionally, beamish, museum, has, reconstructed, a, turn, of, the, century, tramway, using, original, rails, and, preserved, tramcars, in, north, america, these, vehicles, are, called, streetcars, or, trolleys, in, parts, of, the, united, states, the, term, tram, is, more, likely, to, be, understood, as, an, aerial, tramway, or, a, people, mover, though, tram, may, be, used, colloquially, in, canada, streetcar, systems, were, developed, in, late, 19th, to, early, 20th, centuries, in, a, number, of, cities, throughout, north, america, however, most, north, american, cities, saw, their, streetcar, lines, removed, in, the, mid, 20th, century, for, a, variety, of, financial, technological, and, social, reasons, exceptions, included, boston, cleveland, mexico, city, new, orleans, newark, philadelphia, pittsburgh, san, francisco, and, toronto, toronto, operates, the, largest, streetcar, system, in, the, americas, in, terms, of, track, length, and, ridership, operated, by, the, toronto, transit, commission, the, system, consists, of, both, street, running, and, grade, separated, tramways, the, streetcar, system, was, established, in, 1861, and, used, a, variety, of, vehicles, in, its, history, including, horse, drawn, streetcars, peter, witt, streetcars, the, pcc, streetcar, and, the, canadian, light, rail, vehicle, and, its, articulated, counterpart, the, articulated, light, rail, vehicle, since, 29, december, 2019, the, system, exclusively, uses, the, flexity, outlook, made, by, bombardier, transportation, streetcars, once, existed, in, the, canadian, cities, of, calgary, edmonton, halifax, hamilton, kingston, kitchener, london, montreal, ottawa, peterborough, quebec, city, regina, saskatoon, windsor, winnipeg, st, john, s, and, vancouver, however, canadian, cities, excluding, toronto, removed, their, streetcar, systems, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, light, rail, systems, were, introduced, in, calgary, and, edmonton, with, another, light, rail, system, established, in, ottawa, in, 2001, there, has, been, something, of, a, renaissance, for, light, railways, in, mid, sized, cities, with, waterloo, ontario, the, first, to, come, on, line, and, construction, underway, in, mississauga, ontario, and, hamilton, ontario, in, the, late, 20th, century, several, canadian, locales, restored, portions, of, their, defunct, streetcar, lines, operating, them, as, a, heritage, feature, for, tourists, heritage, streetcar, lines, in, canada, include, the, high, level, bridge, streetcar, in, edmonton, the, nelson, electric, tramway, in, nelson, and, the, whitehorse, waterfront, trolley, in, whitehorse, pittsburgh, had, kept, most, of, its, streetcar, system, serving, the,

it, is, thought, that, the, first, example, of, a, working, model, tramcar, in, the, uk, built, by, an, amateur, for, fun, was, in, 1929, when, frank, e, wilson, created, a, replica, of, london, county, council, tramways, e, class, car, 444, in, 1, 16, scale, which, he, demonstrated, at, an, early, model, engineer, exhibition, another, of, his, models, was, london, e, 1, 1800, which, was, the, only, tramway, exhibit, in, the, faraday, memorial, exhibition, of, 1931, together, with, likeminded, friends, frank, wilson, went, on, to, found, the, tramway, light, railway, society, in, 1938,

freight, railroad, car, used, in, coal, mines, and, the, tracks, on, which, they, ran, the, word, tram, probably, derived, from, middle, flemish, trame, beam, handle, of, a, barrow, bar, rung, the, identical, word, trame, with, the, meaning, crossbeam, is, also, used, in, the, french, language, etymologists, believe, that, the, word, tram, refers, to, the, wooden, beams, the, railway, tracks,

although, the, terms, tram, and, tramway, have, been, adopted, by, many, languages, they, are, not, used, universally, in, english, north, americans, prefer, streetcar, trolley, or, trolleycar, the, term, streetcar, is, first, recorded, in, 1840, and, originally, referred, to, horsecars, the, terms, streetcar, and, trolley, are, often, used, interchangeably, in, the, united, states, with,

four, wheeled, device, that, was, dragged, along, dual, overhead, wires, by, a, cable, that, connected, the, troller, to, the, top, of, the, car, and, collected, electrical, power, from, the, overhead, wires, this, portmanteau, derivation, is, however, most, likely, folk, etymology, trolley, and, variants, refer, to, the, verb, troll, meaning, roll, and, probably, derived, from, old, french, and, cognate, uses, of, the, word, were, well, established, for, handcarts, and, horse, drayage, as, well, as, for, nautical, uses, the, alternative, north, american, term, trolley, may,

with, the, trolleybus, a, rubber, tired, vehicle, running, on, hard, pavement, which, draws, its, power, from, pairs, of, overhead, wires, these, electric, buses, which, use, twin, trolley, poles,
