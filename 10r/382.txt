a, spectrometer, s, p, k, t, r, m, t, r, is, a, scientific, instrument, used, to, separate, and, measure, spectral, components, of, a, physical, phenomenon, spectrometer, is, a, broad, term, often, used, to, describe, instruments, that, measure, a, continuous, variable, of, a, phenomenon, where, the, spectral, components, are, somehow, mixed, in, visible, light, a, spectrometer, can, separate, white, light, and, measure, individual, narrow, bands, of, color, called, a, spectrum, a, mass, spectrometer, measures, the, spectrum, of, the, masses, of, the, atoms, or, molecules, present, in, a, gas, the, first, spectrometers, were, used, to, split, light, into, an, array, of, separate, colors, spectrometers, were, developed, in, early, studies, of, physics, astronomy, and, chemistry, the, capability, of, spectroscopy, to, determine, chemical, composition, drove, its, advancement, and, continues, to, be, one, of, its, primary, uses, spectrometers, are, used, in, astronomy, to, analyze, the, chemical, composition, of, stars, and, planets, and, spectrometers, gather, data, on, the, origin, of, the, universe, examples, of, spectrometers, are, devices, that, separate, particles, atoms, and, molecules, by, their, mass, momentum, or, energy, these, types, of, spectrometers, are, used, in, chemical, analysis, and, particle, physics, optical, spectrometers, often, simply, called, spectrometers, in, particular, show, the, intensity, of, light, as, a, function, of, wavelength, or, of, frequency, the, different, wavelengths, of, light, are, separated, by, refraction, in, a, prism, or, by, diffraction, by, a, diffraction, grating, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, is, an, example, these, spectrometers, utilize, the, phenomenon, of, optical, dispersion, the, light, from, a, source, can, consist, of, a, continuous, spectrum, an, emission, spectrum, bright, lines, or, an, absorption, spectrum, dark, lines, because, each, element, leaves, its, spectral, signature, in, the, pattern, of, lines, observed, a, spectral, analysis, can, reveal, the, composition, of, the, object, being, analyzed, a, spectrometer, that, is, calibrated, for, measurement, of, the, incident, optical, power, is, called, a, spectroradiometer, optical, emission, spectrometers, often, called, oes, or, spark, discharge, spectrometers, is, used, to, evaluate, metals, to, determine, the, chemical, composition, with, very, high, accuracy, a, spark, is, applied, through, a, high, voltage, on, the, surface, which, vaporizes, particles, into, a, plasma, the, particles, and, ions, then, emit, radiation, that, is, measured, by, detectors, photomultiplier, tubes, at, different, characteristic, wavelengths, some, forms, of, spectroscopy, involve, analysis, of, electron, energy, rather, than, photon, energy, x, ray, photoelectron, spectroscopy, is, an, example, a, mass, spectrometer, is, an, analytical, instrument, that, is, used, to, identify, the, amount, and, type, of, chemicals, present, in, a, sample, by, measuring, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, and, abundance, of, gas, phase, ions, the, energy, spectrum, of, particles, of, known, mass, can, also, be, measured, by, determining, the, time, of, flight, between, two, detectors, and, hence, the, velocity, in, a, time, of, flight, spectrometer, alternatively, if, the, particle, energy, is, known, masses, can, be, determined, in, a, time, of, flight, mass, spectrometer, when, a, fast, charged, particle, charge, q, mass, m, enters, a, constant, magnetic, field, b, at, right, angles, it, is, deflected, into, a, circular, path, of, radius, r, due, to, the, lorentz, force, the, momentum, p, of, the, particle, is, then, given, by, where, m, and, v, are, mass, and, velocity, of, the, particle, the, focusing, principle, of, the, oldest, and, simplest, magnetic, spectrometer, the, semicircular, spectrometer, invented, by, j, k, danisz, is, shown, on, the, left, a, constant, magnetic, field, is, perpendicular, to, the, page, charged, particles, of, momentum, p, that, pass, the, slit, are, deflected, into, circular, paths, of, radius, r, p, qb, it, turns, out, that, they, all, hit, the, horizontal, line, at, nearly, the, same, place, the, focus, here, a, particle, counter, should, be, placed, varying, b, this, makes, possible, to, measure, the, energy, spectrum, of, alpha, particles, in, an, alpha, particle, spectrometer, of, beta, particles, in, a, beta, particle, spectrometer, of, particles, e, g, fast, ions, in, a, particle, spectrometer, or, to, measure, the, relative, content, of, the, various, masses, in, a, mass, spectrometer, since, danysz, time, many, types, of, magnetic, spectrometers, more, complicated, than, the, semicircular, type, have, been, devised, generally, the, resolution, of, an, instrument, tells, us, how, well, two, close, lying, energies, or, wavelengths, or, frequencies, or, masses, can, be, resolved, generally, for, an, instrument, with, mechanical, slits, higher, resolution, will, mean, lower, intensity
