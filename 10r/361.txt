an, electrical, cable, is, an, assembly, of, one, or, more, wires, running, side, by, side, or, bundled, which, is, used, as, an, electrical, conductor, to, carry, electric, current, electrical, cables, are, used, to, connect, two, or, more, devices, enabling, the, transfer, of, electrical, signals, or, power, from, one, device, to, the, other, physically, an, electrical, cable, is, an, assembly, consisting, of, one, or, more, conductors, with, their, own, insulations, and, optional, screens, individual, coverings, assembly, protection, and, protective, covering, one, or, more, electrical, cables, and, their, corresponding, connectors, may, be, formed, into, a, cable, assembly, which, is, not, necessarily, suitable, for, connecting, two, devices, but, can, be, a, partial, product, e, g, to, be, soldered, onto, a, printed, circuit, board, with, a, connector, mounted, to, the, housing, cable, assemblies, can, also, take, the, form, of, a, cable, tree, or, cable, harness, used, to, connect, many, terminals, together, electrical, cables, are, used, to, connect, two, or, more, devices, enabling, the, transfer, of, electrical, signals, or, power, from, one, device, to, the, other, long, distance, communication, takes, place, over, undersea, communication, cables, power, cables, are, used, for, bulk, transmission, of, alternating, and, direct, current, power, especially, using, high, voltage, cable, electrical, cables, are, extensively, used, in, building, wiring, for, lighting, power, and, control, circuits, permanently, installed, in, buildings, since, all, the, circuit, conductors, required, can, be, installed, in, a, cable, at, one, time, installation, labor, is, saved, compared, to, certain, other, wiring, methods, physically, an, electrical, cable, is, an, assembly, consisting, of, one, or, more, conductors, with, their, own, insulations, and, optional, screens, individual, coverings, assembly, protection, and, protective, coverings, electrical, cables, may, be, made, more, flexible, by, stranding, the, wires, in, this, process, smaller, individual, wires, are, twisted, or, braided, together, to, produce, larger, wires, that, are, more, flexible, than, solid, wires, of, similar, size, bunching, small, wires, before, concentric, stranding, adds, the, most, flexibility, copper, wires, in, a, cable, may, be, bare, or, they, may, be, plated, with, a, thin, layer, of, another, metal, most, often, tin, but, sometimes, gold, silver, or, some, other, material, tin, gold, and, silver, are, much, less, prone, to, oxidation, than, copper, which, may, lengthen, wire, life, and, makes, soldering, easier, tinning, is, also, used, to, provide, lubrication, between, strands, tinning, was, used, to, help, removal, of, rubber, insulation, tight, lays, during, stranding, makes, the, cable, extensible, cba, as, in, telephone, handset, cords, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, electrical, cable, was, often, insulated, using, cloth, rubber, or, paper, plastic, materials, are, generally, used, today, except, for, high, reliability, power, cables, the, first, thermoplastic, used, was, gutta, percha, a, natural, latex, which, was, found, useful, for, underwater, cables, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, and, still, very, common, man, made, plastic, used, for, cable, insulation, was, polyethylene, this, was, invented, in, 1930, but, not, available, outside, military, use, until, after, world, war, 2, during, which, a, telegraph, cable, using, it, was, laid, across, the, english, channel, to, support, troops, following, d, day, cables, can, be, securely, fastened, and, organized, such, as, by, using, trunking, cable, trays, cable, ties, or, cable, lacing, continuous, flex, or, flexible, cables, used, in, moving, applications, within, cable, carriers, can, be, secured, using, strain, relief, devices, or, cable, ties, any, current, carrying, conductor, including, a, cable, radiates, an, electromagnetic, field, likewise, any, conductor, or, cable, will, pick, up, energy, from, any, existing, electromagnetic, field, around, it, these, effects, are, often, undesirable, in, the, first, case, amounting, to, unwanted, transmission, of, energy, which, may, adversely, affect, nearby, equipment, or, other, parts, of, the, same, piece, of, equipment, and, in, the, second, case, unwanted, pickup, of, noise, which, may, mask, the, desired, signal, being, carried, by, the, cable, or, if, the, cable, is, carrying, power, supply, or, control, voltages, pollute, them, to, such, an, extent, as, to, cause, equipment, malfunction, the, first, solution, to, these, problems, is, to, keep, cable, lengths, in, buildings, short, since, pick, up, and, transmission, are, essentially, proportional, to, the, length, of, the, cable, the, second, solution, is, to, route, cables, away, from, trouble, beyond, this, there, are, particular, cable, designs, that, minimize, electromagnetic, pickup, and, transmission, three, of, the, principal, design, techniques, are, shielding, coaxial, geometry, and, twisted, pair, geometry, shielding, makes, use, of, the, electrical, principle, of, the, faraday, cage, the, cable, is, encased, for, its, entire, length, in, foil, or, wire, mesh, all, wires, running, inside, this, shielding, layer, will, be, to, a, large, extent, decoupled, from, external, electrical, fields, particularly, if, the, shield, is, connected, to, a, point, of, constant, voltage, such, as, earth, or, ground, simple, shielding, of, this, type, is, not, greatly, effective, against, low, frequency, magnetic, fields, however, such, as, magnetic, hum, from, a, nearby, power, transformer, a, grounded, shield, on, cables, operating, at, 2, 5, kv, or, more, gathers, leakage, current, and, capacitive, current, protecting, people, from, electric, shock, and, equalizing, stress, on, the, cable, insulation, coaxial, design, helps, to, further, reduce, low, frequency, magnetic, transmission, and, pickup, in, this, design, the, foil, or, mesh, shield, has, a, circular, cross, section, and, the, inner, conductor, is, exactly, at, its, center, this, causes, the, voltages, induced, by, a, magnetic, field, between, the, shield, and, the, core, conductor, to, consist, of, two, nearly, equal, magnitudes, which, cancel, each, other, a, twisted, pair, has, two, wires, of, a, cable, twisted, around, each, other, this, can, be, demonstrated, by, putting, one, end, of, a, pair, of, wires, in, a, hand, drill, and, turning, while, maintaining, moderate, tension, on, the, line, where, the, interfering, signal, has, a, wavelength, that, is, long, compared, to, the, pitch, of, the, twisted, pair, alternate, lengths, of, wires, develop, opposing, voltages, tending, to, cancel, the, effect, of, the, interference, electrical, cable, jacket, material, is, usually, constructed, of, flexible, plastic, which, will, burn, the, fire, hazard, of, grouped, cables, can, be, significant, cables, jacketing, materials, can, be, formulated, to, prevent, fire, spread, see, mineral, insulated, copper, clad, cable, alternately, fire, spread, amongst, combustible, cables, can, be, prevented, by, the, application, of, fire, retardant, coatings, directly, on, the, cable, exterior, or, the, fire, threat, can, be, isolated, by, the, installation, of, boxes, constructed, of, noncombustible, materials, around, the, bulk, cable, installation, cenelec, hd, 361, is, a, ratified, standard, published, by, cenelec, which, relates, to, wire, and, cable, marking, type, whose, goal, is, to, harmonize, cables, deutsches, institut, f, r, normung, din, vde, has, released, a, similar, standard, din, vde, 0292
