a, dam, is, a, barrier, that, stops, or, restricts, the, flow, of, surface, water, or, underground, streams, reservoirs, created, by, dams, not, only, suppress, floods, but, also, provide, water, for, activities, such, as, irrigation, human, consumption, industrial, use, aquaculture, and, navigability, hydropower, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, dams, to, generate, electricity, a, dam, can, also, be, used, to, collect, or, store, water, which, can, be, evenly, distributed, between, locations, dams, generally, serve, the, primary, purpose, of, retaining, water, while, other, structures, such, as, floodgates, or, levees, also, known, as, dikes, are, used, to, manage, or, prevent, water, flow, into, specific, land, regions, the, word, dam, can, be, traced, back, to, middle, english, and, before, that, from, middle, dutch, as, seen, in, the, names, of, many, old, cities, such, as, amsterdam, and, rotterdam, ancient, dams, were, built, in, mesopotamia, and, the, middle, east, for, water, control, the, earliest, known, dam, is, the, jawa, dam, in, jordan, dating, to, 3, 000, bc, egyptians, also, built, dams, such, as, sadd, el, kafara, dam, for, flood, control, in, modern, day, india, dholavira, had, an, intricate, water, management, system, with, 16, reservoirs, and, dams, the, great, dam, of, marib, in, yemen, built, between, 1750, and, 1700, bc, was, an, engineering, wonder, and, eflatun, pinar, a, hittite, dam, and, spring, temple, in, turkey, dates, to, the, 15th, and, 13th, centuries, bc, the, kallanai, dam, in, south, india, built, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, is, one, of, the, oldest, water, regulating, structures, still, in, use, roman, engineers, built, dams, with, advanced, techniques, and, materials, such, as, hydraulic, mortar, and, roman, concrete, which, allowed, for, larger, structures, they, introduced, reservoir, dams, arch, gravity, dams, arch, dams, buttress, dams, and, multiple, arch, buttress, dams, in, iran, bridge, dams, were, used, for, hydropower, and, water, raising, mechanisms, during, the, middle, ages, dams, were, built, in, the, netherlands, to, regulate, water, levels, and, prevent, sea, intrusion, in, the, 19th, century, large, scale, arch, dams, were, constructed, around, the, british, empire, marking, advances, in, dam, engineering, techniques, the, era, of, large, dams, began, with, the, construction, of, the, aswan, low, dam, in, egypt, in, 1902, the, hoover, dam, a, massive, concrete, arch, gravity, dam, was, built, between, 1931, and, 1936, on, the, colorado, river, by, 1997, there, were, an, estimated, 800, 000, dams, worldwide, with, some, 40, 000, of, them, over, 15, meters, high, early, dam, building, took, place, in, mesopotamia, and, the, middle, east, dams, were, used, to, control, water, levels, for, mesopotamia, s, weather, affected, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, the, earliest, known, dam, is, the, jawa, dam, in, jordan, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, northeast, of, the, capital, amman, this, gravity, dam, featured, an, originally, 9, metre, high, 30, ft, and, 1, m, wide, 3, 3, ft, stone, wall, supported, by, a, 50, m, wide, 160, ft, earthen, rampart, the, structure, is, dated, to, 3000, bc, however, the, oldest, continuously, operational, dam, is, lake, homs, dam, built, in, syria, between, 1319, 1304, bc, the, ancient, egyptian, sadd, el, kafara, dam, at, wadi, al, garawi, about, 25, km, 16, mi, south, of, cairo, was, 102, m, 335, ft, long, at, its, base, and, 87, m, 285, ft, wide, the, structure, was, built, around, 2800, or, 2600, bc, as, a, diversion, dam, for, flood, control, but, was, destroyed, by, heavy, rain, during, construction, or, shortly, afterwards, during, the, twelfth, dynasty, in, the, 19th, century, bc, the, pharaohs, senosert, iii, amenemhat, iii, and, amenemhat, iv, dug, a, canal, 16, km, 9, 9, mi, long, linking, the, fayum, depression, to, the, nile, in, middle, egypt, two, dams, called, ha, uar, running, east, west, were, built, to, retain, water, during, the, annual, flood, and, then, release, it, to, surrounding, lands, the, lake, called, mer, wer, or, lake, moeris, covered, 1, 700, km, 2, 660, sq, mi, and, is, known, today, as, birket, qarun, by, the, mid, late, third, millennium, bc, an, intricate, water, management, system, in, dholavira, in, modern, day, india, was, built, the, system, included, 16, reservoirs, dams, and, various, channels, for, collecting, water, and, storing, it, one, of, the, engineering, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, was, the, great, dam, of, marib, in, yemen, initiated, sometime, between, 1750, and, 1700, bc, it, was, made, of, packed, earth, triangular, in, cross, section, 580, m, 1, 900, ft, in, length, and, originally, 4, m, 13, ft, high, running, between, two, groups, of, rocks, on, either, side, to, which, it, was, linked, by, substantial, stonework, repairs, were, carried, out, during, various, periods, most, importantly, around, 750, bc, and, 250, years, later, the, dam, height, was, increased, to, 7, m, 23, ft, after, the, end, of, the, kingdom, of, saba, the, dam, fell, under, the, control, of, the, imyarites, c, 115, bc, who, undertook, further, improvements, creating, a, structure, 14, m, 46, ft, high, with, five, spillways, two, masonry, reinforced, sluices, a, settling, pond, and, a, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, canal, to, a, distribution, tank, these, works, were, not, finished, until, 325, ad, when, the, dam, permitted, the, irrigation, of, 25, 000, acres, 100, km, 2, eflatun, p, nar, is, a, hittite, dam, and, spring, temple, near, konya, turkey, it, is, thought, to, date, from, the, hittite, empire, between, the, 15th, and, 13th, centuries, bc, the, kallanai, is, constructed, of, unhewn, stone, over, 300, m, 980, ft, long, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, high, and, 20, m, 66, ft, wide, across, the, main, stream, of, the, kaveri, river, in, tamil, nadu, south, india, the, basic, structure, dates, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, is, considered, one, of, the, oldest, water, diversion, or, water, regulating, structures, still, in, use, the, purpose, of, the, dam, was, to, divert, the, waters, of, the, kaveri, across, the, fertile, delta, region, for, irrigation, via, canals, du, jiang, yan, is, the, oldest, surviving, irrigation, system, in, china, that, included, a, dam, that, directed, waterflow, it, was, finished, in, 251, bc, a, large, earthen, dam, made, by, sunshu, ao, the, prime, minister, of, chu, state, flooded, a, valley, in, modern, day, northern, anhui, province, that, created, an, enormous, irrigation, reservoir, 100, km, 62, mi, in, circumference, a, reservoir, that, is, still, present, today, roman, dam, construction, was, characterized, by, the, romans, ability, to, plan, and, organize, engineering, construction, on, a, grand, scale, roman, planners, introduced, the, then, novel, concept, of, large, reservoir, dams, which, could, secure, a, permanent, water, supply, for, urban, settlements, over, the, dry, season, their, pioneering, use, of, water, proof, hydraulic, mortar, and, particularly, roman, concrete, allowed, for, much, larger, dam, structures, than, previously, built, such, as, the, lake, homs, dam, possibly, the, largest, water, barrier, to, that, date, and, the, harbaqa, dam, both, in, roman, syria, the, highest, roman, dam, was, the, subiaco, dam, near, rome, its, record, height, of, 50, m, 160, ft, remained, unsurpassed, until, its, accidental, destruction, in, 1305, roman, engineers, made, routine, use, of, ancient, standard, designs, like, embankment, dams, and, masonry, gravity, dams, apart, from, that, they, displayed, a, high, degree, of, inventiveness, introducing, most, of, the, other, basic, dam, designs, which, had, been, unknown, until, then, these, include, arch, gravity, dams, arch, dams, buttress, dams, and, multiple, arch, buttress, dams, all, of, which, were, known, and, employed, by, the, 2nd, century, ad, see, list, of, roman, dams, roman, workforces, also, were, the, first, to, build, dam, bridges, such, as, the, bridge, of, valerian, in, iran, in, iran, bridge, dams, such, as, the, band, e, kaisar, were, used, to, provide, hydropower, through, water, wheels, which, often, powered, water, raising, mechanisms, one, of, the, first, was, the, roman, built, dam, bridge, in, dezful, which, could, raise, water, 50, cubits, c, 23, m, to, supply, the, town, also, diversion, dams, were, known, milling, dams, were, introduced, which, the, muslim, engineers, called, the, pul, i, bulaiti, the, first, was, built, at, shustar, on, the, river, karun, iran, and, many, of, these, were, later, built, in, other, parts, of, the, islamic, world, water, was, conducted, from, the, back, of, the, dam, through, a, large, pipe, to, drive, a, water, wheel, and, watermill, in, the, 10th, century, al, muqaddasi, described, several, dams, in, persia, he, reported, that, one, in, ahwaz, was, more, than, 910, m, 3, 000, ft, long, and, that, it, had, many, water, wheels, raising, the, water, into, aqueducts, through, which, it, flowed, into, reservoirs, of, the, city, another, one, the, band, i, amir, dam, provided, irrigation, for, 300, villages, sh, h, abb, s, arch, persian, also, known, as, kurit, dam, is, the, thinnest, arch, dam, in, the, world, and, one, of, the, oldest, arch, dams, in, asia, it, was, constructed, some, 700, years, ago, in, tabas, county, south, khorasan, province, iran, it, stands, 60, meters, tall, and, in, crest, is, a, one, meter, width, some, historians, believe, the, dam, was, built, by, sh, h, abb, s, i, whereas, others, believe, that, he, repaired, it, in, the, netherlands, a, low, lying, country, dams, were, often, built, to, block, rivers, to, regulate, the, water, level, and, to, prevent, the, sea, from, entering, the, marshlands, such, dams, often, marked, the, beginning, of, a, town, or, city, because, it, was, easy, to, cross, the, river, at, such, a, place, and, often, influenced, dutch, place, names, the, present, dutch, capital, amsterdam, old, name, amstelredam, started, with, a, dam, on, the, river, amstel, in, the, late, 12th, century, and, rotterdam, began, with, a, dam, on, the, river, rotte, a, minor, tributary, of, the, nieuwe, maas, the, central, square, of, amsterdam, covering, the, original, site, of, the, 800, year, old, dam, still, carries, the, name, dam, square, the, romans, were, the, first, to, build, arch, dams, where, the, reaction, forces, from, the, abutment, stabilizes, the, structure, from, the, external, hydrostatic, pressure, but, it, was, only, in, the, 19th, century, that, the, engineering, skills, and, construction, materials, available, were, capable, of, building, the, first, large, scale, arch, dams, three, pioneering, arch, dams, were, built, around, the, british, empire, in, the, early, 19th, century, henry, russel, of, the, royal, engineers, oversaw, the, construction, of, the, mir, alam, dam, in, 1804, to, supply, water, to, the, city, of, hyderabad, it, is, still, in, use, today, it, had, a, height, of, 12, m, 39, ft, and, consisted, of, 21, arches, of, variable, span, in, the, 1820s, and, 30s, lieutenant, colonel, john, by, supervised, the, construction, of, the, rideau, canal, in, canada, near, modern, day, ottawa, and, built, a, series, of, curved, masonry, dams, as, part, of, the, waterway, system, in, particular, the, jones, falls, dam, built, by, john, redpath, was, completed, in, 1832, as, the, largest, dam, in, north, america, and, an, engineering, marvel, in, order, to, keep, the, water, in, control, during, construction, two, sluices, artificial, channels, for, conducting, water, were, kept, open, in, the, dam, the, first, was, near, the, base, of, the, dam, on, its, east, side, a, second, sluice, was, put, in, on, the, west, side, of, the, dam, about, 20, ft, 6, 1, m, above, the, base, to, make, the, switch, from, the, lower, to, upper, sluice, the, outlet, of, sand, lake, was, blocked, off, hunts, creek, near, the, city, of, parramatta, australia, was, dammed, in, the, 1850s, to, cater, to, the, demand, for, water, from, the, growing, population, of, the, city, the, masonry, arch, dam, wall, was, designed, by, lieutenant, percy, simpson, who, was, influenced, by, the, advances, in, dam, engineering, techniques, made, by, the, royal, engineers, in, india, the, dam, cost, 17, 000, and, was, completed, in, 1856, as, the, first, engineered, dam, built, in, australia, and, the, second, arch, dam, in, the, world, built, to, mathematical, specifications, the, first, such, dam, was, opened, two, years, earlier, in, france, it, was, the, first, french, arch, dam, of, the, industrial, era, and, it, was, built, by, fran, ois, zola, in, the, municipality, of, aix, en, provence, to, improve, the, supply, of, water, after, the, 1832, cholera, outbreak, devastated, the, area, after, royal, approval, was, granted, in, 1844, the, dam, was, constructed, over, the, following, decade, its, construction, was, carried, out, on, the, basis, of, the, mathematical, results, of, scientific, stress, analysis, the, 75, miles, dam, near, warwick, australia, was, possibly, the, world, s, first, concrete, arch, dam, designed, by, henry, charles, stanley, in, 1880, with, an, overflow, spillway, and, a, special, water, outlet, it, was, eventually, heightened, to, 10, m, 33, ft, in, the, latter, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, significant, advances, in, the, scientific, theory, of, masonry, dam, design, were, made, this, transformed, dam, design, from, an, art, based, on, empirical, methodology, to, a, profession, based, on, a, rigorously, applied, scientific, theoretical, framework, this, new, emphasis, was, centered, around, the, engineering, faculties, of, universities, in, france, and, in, the, united, kingdom, william, john, macquorn, rankine, at, the, university, of, glasgow, pioneered, the, theoretical, understanding, of, dam, structures, in, his, 1857, paper, on, the, stability, of, loose, earth, rankine, theory, provided, a, good, understanding, of, the, principles, behind, dam, design, in, france, j, augustin, tortene, de, sazilly, explained, the, mechanics, of, vertically, faced, masonry, gravity, dams, and, zola, s, dam, was, the, first, to, be, built, on, the, basis, of, these, principles, the, era, of, large, dams, was, initiated, with, the, construction, of, the, aswan, low, dam, in, egypt, in, 1902, a, gravity, masonry, buttress, dam, on, the, nile, river, following, their, 1882, invasion, and, occupation, of, egypt, the, british, began, construction, in, 1898, the, project, was, designed, by, sir, william, willcocks, and, involved, several, eminent, engineers, of, the, time, including, sir, benjamin, baker, and, sir, john, aird, whose, firm, john, aird, co, was, the, main, contractor, capital, and, financing, were, furnished, by, ernest, cassel, when, initially, constructed, between, 1899, and, 1902, nothing, of, its, scale, had, ever, before, been, attempted, on, completion, it, was, the, largest, masonry, dam, in, the, world, the, hoover, dam, is, a, massive, concrete, arch, gravity, dam, constructed, in, the, black, canyon, of, the, colorado, river, on, the, border, between, the, us, states, of, arizona, and, nevada, between, 1931, and, 1936, during, the, great, depression, in, 1928, congress, authorized, the, project, to, build, a, dam, that, would, control, floods, provide, irrigation, water, and, produce, hydroelectric, power, the, winning, bid, to, build, the, dam, was, submitted, by, a, consortium, called, six, companies, inc, such, a, large, concrete, structure, had, never, been, built, before, and, some, of, the, techniques, were, unproven, the, torrid, summer, weather, and, the, lack, of, facilities, near, the, site, also, presented, difficulties, nevertheless, six, companies, turned, over, the, dam, to, the, federal, government, on, 1, march, 1936, more, than, two, years, ahead, of, schedule, by, 1997, there, were, an, estimated, 800, 000, dams, worldwide, some, 40, 000, of, them, over, 15, m, 49, ft, high, in, 2014, scholars, from, the, university, of, oxford, published, a, study, of, the, cost, of, large, dams, based, on, the, largest, existing, dataset, documenting, significant, cost, overruns, for, a, majority, of, dams, and, questioning, whether, benefits, typically, offset, costs, for, such, dams, dams, can, be, formed, by, human, agency, natural, causes, or, even, by, the, intervention, of, wildlife, such, as, beavers, man, made, dams, are, typically, classified, according, to, their, size, height, intended, purpose, or, structure, based, on, structure, and, material, used, dams, are, classified, as, easily, created, without, materials, arch, gravity, dams, embankment, dams, or, masonry, dams, with, several, subtypes, in, the, arch, dam, stability, is, obtained, by, a, combination, of, arch, and, gravity, action, if, the, upstream, face, is, vertical, the, entire, weight, of, the, dam, must, be, carried, to, the, foundation, by, gravity, while, the, distribution, of, the, normal, hydrostatic, pressure, between, vertical, cantilever, and, arch, action, will, depend, upon, the, stiffness, of, the, dam, in, a, vertical, and, horizontal, direction, when, the, upstream, face, is, sloped, the, distribution, is, more, complicated, the, normal, component, of, the, weight, of, the, arch, ring, may, be, taken, by, the, arch, action, while, the, normal, hydrostatic, pressure, will, be, distributed, as, described, above, for, this, type, of, dam, firm, reliable, supports, at, the, abutments, either, buttress, or, canyon, side, wall, are, more, important, the, most, desirable, place, for, an, arch, dam, is, a, narrow, canyon, with, steep, side, walls, composed, of, sound, rock, the, safety, of, an, arch, dam, is, dependent, on, the, strength, of, the, side, wall, abutments, hence, not, only, should, the, arch, be, well, seated, on, the, side, walls, but, also, the, character, of, the, rock, should, be, carefully, inspected, two, types, of, single, arch, dams, are, in, use, namely, the, constant, angle, and, the, constant, radius, dam, the, constant, radius, type, employs, the, same, face, radius, at, all, elevations, of, the, dam, which, means, that, as, the, channel, grows, narrower, towards, the, bottom, of, the, dam, the, central, angle, subtended, by, the, face, of, the, dam, becomes, smaller, jones, falls, dam, in, canada, is, a, constant, radius, dam, in, a, constant, angle, dam, also, known, as, a, variable, radius, dam, this, subtended, angle, is, kept, constant, and, the, variation, in, distance, between, the, abutments, at, various, levels, is, taken, care, of, by, varying, the, radii, constant, radius, dams, are, much, less, common, than, constant, angle, dams, parker, dam, on, the, colorado, river, is, a, constant, angle, arch, dam, a, similar, type, is, the, double, curvature, or, thin, shell, dam, wildhorse, dam, near, mountain, city, nevada, in, the, united, states, is, an, example, of, the, type, this, method, of, construction, minimizes, the, amount, of, concrete, necessary, for, construction, but, transmits, large, loads, to, the, foundation, and, abutments, the, appearance, is, similar, to, a, single, arch, dam, but, with, a, distinct, vertical, curvature, to, it, as, well, lending, it, the, vague, appearance, of, a, concave, lens, as, viewed, from, downstream, the, multiple, arch, dam, consists, of, a, number, of, single, arch, dams, with, concrete, buttresses, as, the, supporting, abutments, as, for, example, the, daniel, johnson, dam, qu, bec, canada, the, multiple, arch, dam, does, not, require, as, many, buttresses, as, the, hollow, gravity, type, but, requires, a, good, rock, foundation, because, the, buttress, loads, are, heavy, in, a, gravity, dam, the, force, that, holds, the, dam, in, place, against, the, push, from, the, water, is, earth, s, gravity, pulling, down, on, the, mass, of, the, dam, the, water, presses, laterally, downstream, on, the, dam, tending, to, overturn, the, dam, by, rotating, about, its, toe, a, point, at, the, bottom, downstream, side, of, the, dam, the, dam, s, weight, counteracts, that, force, tending, to, rotate, the, dam, the, other, way, about, its, toe, the, designer, ensures, that, the, dam, is, heavy, enough, that, the, dam, s, weight, wins, that, contest, in, engineering, terms, that, is, true, whenever, the, resultant, of, the, forces, of, gravity, acting, on, the, dam, and, water, pressure, on, the, dam, acts, in, a, line, that, passes, upstream, of, the, toe, of, the, dam, the, designer, tries, to, shape, the, dam, so, if, one, were, to, consider, the, part, of, the, dam, above, any, particular, height, to, be, a, whole, dam, itself, that, dam, also, would, be, held, in, place, by, gravity, i, e, there, is, no, tension, in, the, upstream, face, of, the, dam, holding, the, top, of, the, dam, down, the, designer, does, this, because, it, is, usually, more, practical, to, make, a, dam, of, material, essentially, just, piled, up, than, to, make, the, material, stick, together, against, vertical, tension, the, shape, that, prevents, tension, in, the, upstream, face, also, eliminates, a, balancing, compression, stress, in, the, downstream, face, providing, additional, economy, for, this, type, of, dam, it, is, essential, to, have, an, impervious, foundation, with, high, bearing, strength, permeable, foundations, have, a, greater, likelihood, of, generating, uplift, pressures, under, the, dam, uplift, pressures, are, hydrostatic, pressures, caused, by, the, water, pressure, of, the, reservoir, pushing, up, against, the, bottom, of, the, dam, if, large, enough, uplift, pressures, are, generated, there, is, a, risk, of, destabilizing, the, concrete, gravity, dam, on, a, suitable, site, a, gravity, dam, can, prove, to, be, a, better, alternative, to, other, types, of, dams, when, built, on, a, solid, foundation, the, gravity, dam, probably, represents, the, best, developed, example, of, dam, building, since, the, fear, of, flood, is, a, strong, motivator, in, many, regions, gravity, dams, are, built, in, some, instances, where, an, arch, dam, would, have, been, more, economical, gravity, dams, are, classified, as, solid, or, hollow, and, are, generally, made, of, either, concrete, or, masonry, the, solid, form, is, the, more, widely, used, of, the, two, though, the, hollow, dam, is, frequently, more, economical, to, construct, grand, coulee, dam, is, a, solid, gravity, dam, and, braddock, locks, dam, is, a, hollow, gravity, dam, a, gravity, dam, can, be, combined, with, an, arch, dam, into, an, arch, gravity, dam, for, areas, with, massive, amounts, of, water, flow, but, less, material, available, for, a, pure, gravity, dam, the, inward, compression, of, the, dam, by, the, water, reduces, the, lateral, horizontal, force, acting, on, the, dam, thus, the, gravitational, force, required, by, the, dam, is, lessened, i, e, the, dam, does, not, need, to, be, so, massive, this, enables, thinner, dams, and, saves, resources, a, barrage, dam, is, a, special, kind, of, dam, that, consists, of, a, line, of, large, gates, that, can, be, opened, or, closed, to, control, the, amount, of, water, passing, the, dam, the, gates, are, set, between, flanking, piers, which, are, responsible, for, supporting, the, water, load, and, are, often, used, to, control, and, stabilize, water, flow, for, irrigation, systems, an, example, of, this, type, of, dam, is, the, now, decommissioned, red, bluff, diversion, dam, on, the, sacramento, river, near, red, bluff, california, barrages, that, are, built, at, the, mouths, of, rivers, or, lagoons, to, prevent, tidal, incursions, or, use, the, tidal, flow, for, tidal, power, are, known, as, tidal, barrages, embankment, dams, are, made, of, compacted, earth, and, are, of, two, main, types, rock, fill, and, earth, fill, like, concrete, gravity, dams, embankment, dams, rely, on, their, weight, to, hold, back, the, force, of, water, a, fixed, crest, dam, is, a, concrete, barrier, across, a, river, fixed, crest, dams, are, designed, to, maintain, depth, in, the, channel, for, navigation, they, pose, risks, to, boaters, who, may, travel, over, them, as, they, are, hard, to, spot, from, the, water, and, create, induced, currents, that, are, difficult, to, escape, there, is, variability, both, worldwide, and, within, individual, countries, such, as, in, the, united, states, in, how, dams, of, different, sizes, are, categorized, dam, size, influences, construction, repair, and, removal, costs, and, affects, the, dams, potential, range, and, magnitude, of, environmental, disturbances, the, international, commission, on, large, dams, icold, defines, a, large, dam, as, a, dam, with, a, height, of, 15, m, 49, ft, or, greater, from, lowest, foundation, to, crest, or, a, dam, between, 5, m, 16, ft, metres, and, 15, metres, impounding, more, than, 3, million, cubic, metres, 2, 400, acre, ft, major, dams, are, over, 150, m, 490, ft, in, height, the, report, of, the, world, commission, on, dams, also, includes, in, the, large, category, dams, which, are, between, 5, and, 15, m, 16, and, 49, ft, high, with, a, reservoir, capacity, of, more, than, 3, million, cubic, metres, 2, 400, acre, ft, hydropower, dams, can, be, classified, as, either, high, head, greater, than, 30, m, in, height, or, low, head, less, than, 30, m, in, height, as, of, 2021, icold, s, world, register, of, dams, contains, 58, 700, large, dam, records, 6, the, tallest, dam, in, the, world, is, the, 305, m, high, 1, 001, ft, jinping, i, dam, in, china, as, with, large, dams, small, dams, have, multiple, uses, such, as, but, not, limited, to, hydropower, production, flood, protection, and, water, storage, small, dams, can, be, particularly, useful, on, farms, to, capture, runoff, for, later, use, for, example, during, the, dry, season, small, scale, dams, have, the, potential, to, generate, benefits, without, displacing, people, as, well, and, small, decentralised, hydroelectric, dams, can, aid, rural, development, in, developing, countries, in, the, united, states, alone, there, are, approximately, 2, 000, 000, or, more, small, dams, that, are, not, included, in, the, army, corps, of, engineers, national, inventory, of, dams, records, of, small, dams, are, kept, by, state, regulatory, agencies, and, therefore, information, about, small, dams, is, dispersed, and, uneven, in, geographic, coverage, countries, worldwide, consider, small, hydropower, plants, shps, important, for, their, energy, strategies, and, there, has, been, a, notable, increase, in, interest, in, shps, couto, and, olden, 2018, conducted, a, global, study, and, found, 82, 891, small, hydropower, plants, shps, operating, or, under, construction, technical, definitions, of, shps, such, as, their, maximum, generation, capacity, dam, height, reservoir, area, etc, vary, by, country, a, dam, is, non, jurisdictional, when, its, size, usually, small, excludes, it, from, being, subject, to, certain, legal, regulations, the, technical, criteria, for, categorising, a, dam, as, jurisdictional, or, non, jurisdictional, varies, by, location, in, the, united, states, each, state, defines, what, constitutes, a, non, jurisdictional, dam, in, the, state, of, colorado, a, non, jurisdictional, dam, is, defined, as, a, dam, creating, a, reservoir, with, a, capacity, of, 100, acre, feet, or, less, and, a, surface, area, of, 20, acres, or, less, and, with, a, height, measured, as, defined, in, rules, 4, 2, 5, 1, and, 4, 2, 19, of, 10, feet, or, less, in, contrast, the, state, of, new, mexico, defines, a, jurisdictional, dam, as, 25, feet, or, greater, in, height, and, storing, more, than, 15, acre, feet, or, a, dam, that, stores, 50, acre, feet, or, greater, and, is, six, feet, or, more, in, height, section, 72, 5, 32, nmsa, suggesting, that, dams, that, do, not, meet, these, requirements, are, non, jurisdictional, most, us, dams, 2, 41, million, of, a, total, of, 2, 5, million, dams, are, not, under, the, jurisdiction, of, any, public, agency, i, e, they, are, non, jurisdictional, nor, are, they, listed, on, the, national, inventory, of, dams, nid, small, dams, incur, risks, similar, to, large, dams, however, the, absence, of, regulation, unlike, more, regulated, large, dams, and, of, an, inventory, of, small, dams, i, e, those, that, are, non, jurisdictional, can, lead, to, significant, risks, for, both, humans, and, ecosystems, for, example, according, to, the, us, national, park, service, nps, non, jurisdictional, means, a, structure, which, does, not, meet, the, minimum, criteria, as, listed, in, the, federal, guidelines, for, dam, safety, to, be, included, in, dam, safety, programs, the, non, jurisdictional, structure, does, not, receive, a, hazard, classification, and, is, not, considered, for, any, further, requirements, or, activities, under, the, nps, dam, safety, program, small, dams, can, be, dangerous, individually, i, e, they, can, fail, but, also, collectively, as, an, aggregation, of, small, dams, along, a, river, or, within, a, geographic, area, can, multiply, risks, graham, s, 1999, study, of, us, dam, failures, resulting, in, fatalities, from, 1960, to, 1998, concluded, that, the, failure, of, dams, between, 6, 1, and, 15, m, high, typical, height, range, of, smaller, dams, caused, 86, of, the, deaths, and, the, failure, of, dams, less, than, 6, 1, m, high, caused, 2, of, the, deaths, non, jurisdictional, dams, may, pose, hazards, because, their, design, construction, maintenance, and, surveillance, is, unregulated, scholars, have, noted, that, more, research, is, needed, to, better, understand, the, environmental, impact, of, small, dams, e, g, their, potential, to, alter, the, flow, temperature, sediment, and, plant, and, animal, diversity, of, a, river, a, saddle, dam, is, an, auxiliary, dam, constructed, to, confine, the, reservoir, created, by, a, primary, dam, either, to, permit, a, higher, water, elevation, and, storage, or, to, limit, the, extent, of, a, reservoir, for, increased, efficiency, an, auxiliary, dam, is, constructed, in, a, low, spot, or, saddle, through, which, the, reservoir, would, otherwise, escape, on, occasion, a, reservoir, is, contained, by, a, similar, structure, called, a, dike, to, prevent, inundation, of, nearby, land, dikes, are, commonly, used, for, reclamation, of, arable, land, from, a, shallow, lake, similar, to, a, levee, which, is, a, wall, or, embankment, built, along, a, river, or, stream, to, protect, adjacent, land, from, flooding, a, weir, sometimes, called, an, overflow, dam, is, a, small, dam, that, is, often, used, in, a, river, channel, to, create, an, impoundment, lake, for, water, abstraction, purposes, and, which, can, also, be, used, for, flow, measurement, or, retardation, a, check, dam, is, a, small, dam, designed, to, reduce, flow, velocity, and, control, soil, erosion, conversely, a, wing, dam, is, a, structure, that, only, partly, restricts, a, waterway, creating, a, faster, channel, that, resists, the, accumulation, of, sediment, a, dry, dam, also, known, as, a, flood, retarding, structure, is, designed, to, control, flooding, it, normally, holds, back, no, water, and, allows, the, channel, to, flow, freely, except, during, periods, of, intense, flow, that, would, otherwise, cause, flooding, downstream, a, diversionary, dam, is, designed, to, divert, all, or, a, portion, of, the, flow, of, a, river, from, its, natural, course, the, water, may, be, redirected, into, a, canal, or, tunnel, for, irrigation, and, or, hydroelectric, power, production, underground, dams, are, used, to, trap, groundwater, and, store, all, or, most, of, it, below, the, surface, for, extended, use, in, a, localized, area, in, some, cases, they, are, also, built, to, prevent, saltwater, from, intruding, into, a, freshwater, aquifer, underground, dams, are, typically, constructed, in, areas, where, water, resources, are, minimal, and, need, to, be, efficiently, stored, such, as, in, deserts, and, on, islands, like, the, fukuzato, dam, in, okinawa, japan, they, are, most, common, in, northeastern, africa, and, the, arid, areas, of, brazil, while, also, being, used, in, the, southwestern, united, states, mexico, india, germany, italy, greece, france, and, japan, there, are, two, types, of, underground, dams, sub, surface, and, a, sand, storage, a, sub, surface, dam, is, built, across, an, aquifer, or, drainage, route, from, an, impervious, layer, such, as, solid, bedrock, up, to, just, below, the, surface, they, can, be, constructed, of, a, variety, of, materials, to, include, bricks, stones, concrete, steel, or, pvc, once, built, the, water, stored, behind, the, dam, raises, the, water, table, and, is, then, extracted, with, wells, a, sand, storage, dam, is, a, weir, built, in, stages, across, a, stream, or, wadi, it, must, be, strong, as, floods, will, wash, over, its, crest, over, time, sand, accumulates, in, layers, behind, the, dam, which, helps, store, water, and, most, importantly, prevent, evaporation, the, stored, water, can, be, extracted, with, a, well, through, the, dam, body, or, by, means, of, a, drain, pipe, a, tailings, dam, is, typically, an, earth, fill, embankment, dam, used, to, store, tailings, which, are, produced, during, mining, operations, after, separating, the, valuable, fraction, from, the, uneconomic, fraction, of, an, ore, conventional, water, retention, dams, can, serve, this, purpose, but, due, to, cost, a, tailings, dam, is, more, viable, unlike, water, retention, dams, a, tailings, dam, is, raised, in, succession, throughout, the, life, of, the, particular, mine, typically, a, base, or, starter, dam, is, constructed, and, as, it, fills, with, a, mixture, of, tailings, and, water, it, is, raised, material, used, to, raise, the, dam, can, include, the, tailings, depending, on, their, size, along, with, soil, there, are, three, raised, tailings, dam, designs, the, upstream, downstream, and, centerline, named, according, to, the, movement, of, the, crest, during, raising, the, specific, design, used, is, dependent, upon, topography, geology, climate, the, type, of, tailings, and, cost, an, upstream, tailings, dam, consists, of, trapezoidal, embankments, being, constructed, on, top, but, toe, to, crest, of, another, moving, the, crest, further, upstream, this, creates, a, relatively, flat, downstream, side, and, a, jagged, upstream, side, which, is, supported, by, tailings, slurry, in, the, impoundment, the, downstream, design, refers, to, the, successive, raising, of, the, embankment, that, positions, the, fill, and, crest, further, downstream, a, centerlined, dam, has, sequential, embankment, dams, constructed, directly, on, top, of, another, while, fill, is, placed, on, the, downstream, side, for, support, and, slurry, supports, the, upstream, side, because, tailings, dams, often, store, toxic, chemicals, from, the, mining, process, modern, designs, incorporate, an, impervious, geomembrane, liner, to, prevent, seepage, water, slurry, levels, in, the, tailings, pond, must, be, managed, for, stability, and, environmental, purposes, as, well, a, steel, dam, is, a, type, of, dam, briefly, experimented, with, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, which, uses, steel, plating, at, an, angle, and, load, bearing, beams, as, the, structure, intended, as, permanent, structures, steel, dams, were, an, failed, experiment, to, determine, if, a, construction, technique, could, be, devised, that, was, cheaper, than, masonry, concrete, or, earthworks, but, sturdier, than, timber, crib, dams, timber, dams, were, widely, used, in, the, early, part, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, in, frontier, areas, due, to, ease, and, speed, of, construction, rarely, built, in, modern, times, because, of, their, relatively, short, lifespan, and, the, limited, height, to, which, they, can, be, built, timber, dams, must, be, kept, constantly, wet, in, order, to, maintain, their, water, retention, properties, and, limit, deterioration, by, rot, similar, to, a, barrel, the, locations, where, timber, dams, are, most, economical, to, build, are, those, where, timber, is, plentiful, cement, is, costly, or, difficult, to, transport, and, either, a, low, head, diversion, dam, is, required, or, longevity, is, not, an, issue, timber, dams, were, once, numerous, especially, in, the, north, american, west, but, most, have, failed, been, hidden, under, earth, embankments, or, been, replaced, with, entirely, new, structures, two, common, variations, of, timber, dams, were, the, crib, and, the, plank, timber, crib, dams, were, erected, of, heavy, timbers, or, dressed, logs, in, the, manner, of, a, log, house, and, the, interior, filled, with, earth, or, rubble, the, heavy, crib, structure, supported, the, dam, s, face, and, the, weight, of, the, water, splash, dams, were, timber, crib, dams, used, to, help, float, logs, downstream, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, timber, plank, dams, were, more, elegant, structures, that, employed, a, variety, of, construction, methods, using, heavy, timbers, to, support, a, water, retaining, arrangement, of, planks, a, cofferdam, is, a, barrier, usually, temporary, constructed, to, exclude, water, from, an, area, that, is, normally, submerged, made, commonly, of, wood, concrete, or, steel, sheet, piling, cofferdams, are, used, to, allow, construction, on, the, foundation, of, permanent, dams, bridges, and, similar, structures, when, the, project, is, completed, the, cofferdam, will, usually, be, demolished, or, removed, unless, the, area, requires, continuous, maintenance, see, also, causeway, and, retaining, wall, common, uses, for, cofferdams, include, the, construction, and, repair, of, offshore, oil, platforms, in, such, cases, the, cofferdam, is, fabricated, from, sheet, steel, and, welded, into, place, under, water, air, is, pumped, into, the, space, displacing, the, water, and, allowing, a, dry, work, environment, below, the, surface, dams, can, also, be, created, by, natural, geological, forces, lava, dams, are, formed, when, lava, flows, often, basaltic, intercept, the, path, of, a, stream, or, lake, outlet, resulting, in, the, creation, of, a, natural, impoundment, an, example, would, be, the, eruptions, of, the, uinkaret, volcanic, field, about, 1, 8, million, 10, 000, years, ago, which, created, lava, dams, on, the, colorado, river, in, northern, arizona, in, the, united, states, the, largest, such, lake, grew, to, about, 800, km, 500, mi, in, length, before, the, failure, of, its, dam, glacial, activity, can, also, form, natural, dams, such, as, the, damming, of, the, clark, fork, in, montana, by, the, cordilleran, ice, sheet, which, formed, the, 7, 780, km, 2, 3, 000, sq, mi, glacial, lake, missoula, near, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, moraine, deposits, left, behind, by, glaciers, can, also, dam, rivers, to, form, lakes, such, as, at, flathead, lake, also, in, montana, see, moraine, dammed, lake, natural, disasters, such, as, earthquakes, and, landslides, frequently, create, landslide, dams, in, mountainous, regions, with, unstable, local, geology, historical, examples, include, the, usoi, dam, in, tajikistan, which, blocks, the, murghab, river, to, create, sarez, lake, at, 560, m, 1, 840, ft, high, it, is, the, tallest, dam, in, the, world, including, both, natural, and, man, made, dams, a, more, recent, example, would, be, the, creation, of, attabad, lake, by, a, landslide, on, pakistan, s, hunza, river, natural, dams, often, pose, significant, hazards, to, human, settlements, and, infrastructure, the, resulting, lakes, often, flood, inhabited, areas, while, a, catastrophic, failure, of, the, dam, could, cause, even, greater, damage, such, as, the, failure, of, western, wyoming, s, gros, ventre, landslide, in, 1927, which, wiped, out, the, town, of, kelly, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, six, people, beavers, create, dams, primarily, out, of, mud, and, sticks, to, flood, a, particular, habitable, area, by, flooding, a, parcel, of, land, beavers, can, navigate, below, or, near, the, surface, and, remain, relatively, well, hidden, or, protected, from, predators, the, flooded, region, also, allows, beavers, access, to, food, especially, during, the, winter, as, of, 2005, hydroelectric, power, mostly, from, dams, supplies, some, 19, of, the, world, s, electricity, and, over, 63, of, renewable, energy, much, of, this, is, generated, by, large, dams, although, china, uses, small, scale, hydro, generation, on, a, wide, scale, and, is, responsible, for, about, 50, of, world, use, of, this, type, of, power, most, hydroelectric, power, comes, from, the, potential, energy, of, dammed, water, driving, a, water, turbine, and, generator, to, boost, the, power, generation, capabilities, of, a, dam, the, water, may, be, run, through, a, large, pipe, called, a, penstock, before, the, turbine, a, variant, on, this, simple, model, uses, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, to, produce, electricity, to, match, periods, of, high, and, low, demand, by, moving, water, between, reservoirs, at, different, elevations, at, times, of, low, electrical, demand, excess, generation, capacity, is, used, to, pump, water, into, the, higher, reservoir, when, there, is, higher, demand, water, is, released, back, into, the, lower, reservoir, through, a, turbine, for, example, see, dinorwig, power, station, a, spillway, is, a, section, of, a, dam, designed, to, pass, water, from, the, upstream, side, of, a, dam, to, the, downstream, side, many, spillways, have, floodgates, designed, to, control, the, flow, through, the, spillway, there, are, several, types, of, spillway, a, service, spillway, or, primary, spillway, passes, normal, flow, an, auxiliary, spillway, releases, flow, in, excess, of, the, capacity, of, the, service, spillway, an, emergency, spillway, is, designed, for, extreme, conditions, such, as, a, serious, malfunction, of, the, service, spillway, a, fuse, plug, spillway, is, a, low, embankment, designed, to, be, overtopped, and, washed, away, in, the, event, of, a, large, flood, the, elements, of, a, fuse, plug, are, independent, free, standing, blocks, set, side, by, side, which, work, without, any, remote, control, they, allow, increasing, the, normal, pool, of, the, dam, without, compromising, the, security, of, the, dam, because, they, are, designed, to, be, gradually, evacuated, for, exceptional, events, they, work, as, fixed, weirs, at, times, by, allowing, overflow, in, common, floods, a, spillway, can, be, gradually, eroded, by, water, flow, including, cavitation, or, turbulence, of, the, water, flowing, over, the, spillway, leading, to, its, failure, it, was, the, inadequate, design, of, the, spillway, and, installation, of, fish, screens, that, led, to, the, 1889, over, topping, of, the, south, fork, dam, in, johnstown, pennsylvania, resulting, in, the, johnstown, flood, the, great, flood, of, 1889, erosion, rates, are, often, monitored, and, the, risk, is, ordinarily, minimized, by, shaping, the, downstream, face, of, the, spillway, into, a, curve, that, minimizes, turbulent, flow, such, as, an, ogee, curve, some, of, these, purposes, are, conflicting, and, the, dam, operator, needs, to, make, dynamic, tradeoffs, for, example, power, generation, and, water, supply, would, keep, the, reservoir, high, whereas, flood, prevention, would, keep, it, low, many, dams, in, areas, where, precipitation, fluctuates, in, an, annual, cycle, will, also, see, the, reservoir, fluctuate, annually, in, an, attempt, to, balance, these, different, purposes, dam, management, becomes, a, complex, exercise, amongst, competing, stakeholders, one, of, the, best, places, for, building, a, dam, is, a, narrow, part, of, a, deep, river, valley, the, valley, sides, can, then, act, as, natural, walls, the, primary, function, of, the, dam, s, structure, is, to, fill, the, gap, in, the, natural, reservoir, line, left, by, the, stream, channel, the, sites, are, usually, those, where, the, gap, becomes, a, minimum, for, the, required, storage, capacity, the, most, economical, arrangement, is, often, a, composite, structure, such, as, a, masonry, dam, flanked, by, earth, embankments, the, current, use, of, the, land, to, be, flooded, should, be, dispensable, significant, other, engineering, and, engineering, geology, considerations, when, building, a, dam, include, impact, is, assessed, in, several, ways, the, benefits, to, human, society, arising, from, the, dam, agriculture, water, damage, prevention, and, power, harm, or, benefit, to, nature, and, wildlife, impact, on, the, geology, of, an, area, whether, the, change, to, water, flow, and, levels, will, increase, or, decrease, stability, and, the, disruption, to, human, lives, relocation, loss, of, archeological, or, cultural, matters, underwater, reservoirs, held, behind, dams, affect, many, ecological, aspects, of, a, river, rivers, topography, and, dynamics, depend, on, a, wide, range, of, flows, whilst, rivers, below, dams, often, experience, long, periods, of, very, stable, flow, conditions, or, sawtooth, flow, patterns, caused, by, releases, followed, by, no, releases, water, releases, from, a, reservoir, including, that, exiting, a, turbine, usually, contain, very, little, suspended, sediment, and, this, in, turn, can, lead, to, scouring, of, river, beds, and, loss, of, riverbanks, for, example, the, daily, cyclic, flow, variation, caused, by, the, glen, canyon, dam, was, a, contributor, to, sand, bar, erosion, older, dams, often, lack, a, fish, ladder, which, keeps, many, fish, from, moving, upstream, to, their, natural, breeding, grounds, causing, failure, of, breeding, cycles, or, blocking, of, migration, paths, even, fish, ladders, do, not, prevent, a, reduction, in, fish, reaching, the, spawning, grounds, upstream, in, some, areas, young, fish, smolt, are, transported, downstream, by, barge, during, parts, of, the, year, turbine, and, power, plant, designs, that, have, a, lower, impact, upon, aquatic, life, are, an, active, area, of, research, at, the, same, time, however, some, particular, dams, may, contribute, to, the, establishment, of, better, conditions, for, some, kinds, of, fish, and, other, aquatic, organisms, studies, have, demonstrated, the, key, role, played, by, tributaries, in, the, downstream, direction, from, the, main, river, impoundment, which, influenced, local, environmental, conditions, and, beta, diversity, patterns, of, each, biological, group, both, replacement, and, richness, differences, contributed, to, high, values, of, total, beta, diversity, for, fish, average, 0, 77, and, phytoplankton, average, 0, 79, but, their, relative, importance, was, more, associated, with, the, replacement, component, for, both, biological, groups, average, 0, 45, and, 0, 52, respectively, a, study, conducted, by, de, almeida, r, a, steiner, m, t, a, and, others, found, that, while, some, species, declined, in, population, by, more, than, 30, after, the, building, of, the, dam, others, increased, their, population, by, 28, such, changes, may, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, the, fish, obtained, different, feeding, habits, with, almost, all, species, being, found, in, more, than, one, group, a, large, dam, can, cause, the, loss, of, entire, ecospheres, including, endangered, and, undiscovered, species, in, the, area, and, the, replacement, of, the, original, environment, by, a, new, inland, lake, as, a, result, the, construction, of, dams, have, been, opposed, in, various, countries, with, some, such, as, tasmania, s, franklin, dam, project, being, cancelled, following, environmentalist, campaigns, large, reservoirs, formed, behind, dams, have, been, indicated, in, the, contribution, of, seismic, activity, due, to, changes, in, water, load, and, or, the, height, of, the, water, table, however, this, is, a, mistaken, assumption, because, the, relatively, marginal, stress, attributed, to, the, water, load, is, orders, of, magnitude, lesser, than, the, force, of, an, earthquake, the, increased, stress, from, the, water, load, is, insufficient, to, fracture, the, earth, s, crust, and, thus, does, not, increase, the, severity, of, an, earthquake, dams, are, also, found, to, influence, global, warming, the, changing, water, levels, in, reservoirs, are, a, source, for, greenhouse, gases, like, methane, while, dams, and, the, water, behind, them, cover, only, a, small, portion, of, earth, s, surface, they, harbour, biological, activity, that, can, produce, large, quantities, of, greenhouse, gases, dams, impact, on, human, society, is, significant, nick, cullather, argues, in, hungry, world, america, s, cold, war, battle, against, poverty, in, asia, that, dam, construction, requires, the, state, to, displace, people, in, the, name, of, the, common, good, and, that, it, often, leads, to, abuses, of, the, masses, by, planners, he, cites, morarji, desai, interior, minister, of, india, in, 1960, speaking, to, villagers, upset, about, the, pong, dam, who, threatened, to, release, the, waters, and, drown, the, villagers, if, they, did, not, cooperate, the, three, gorges, dam, on, the, yangtze, river, in, china, is, more, than, five, times, the, size, of, the, hoover, dam, u, s, it, creates, a, reservoir, 600, km, 370, mi, long, to, be, used, for, flood, control, and, hydropower, generation, its, construction, required, the, loss, of, over, a, million, people, s, homes, and, their, mass, relocation, the, loss, of, many, valuable, archaeological, and, cultural, sites, and, significant, ecological, change, during, the, 2010, china, floods, the, dam, held, back, a, what, would, have, been, a, disastrous, flood, and, the, huge, reservoir, rose, by, 4, m, 13, ft, overnight, in, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, 40, 80, million, people, worldwide, have, been, displaced, from, their, homes, as, a, result, of, dam, construction, construction, of, a, hydroelectric, plant, requires, a, long, lead, time, for, site, studies, hydrological, studies, and, environmental, impact, assessments, and, are, large, scale, projects, in, comparison, to, carbon, based, power, generation, the, number, of, sites, that, can, be, economically, developed, for, hydroelectric, production, is, limited, new, sites, tend, to, be, far, from, population, centers, and, usually, require, extensive, power, transmission, lines, hydroelectric, generation, can, be, vulnerable, to, major, changes, in, the, climate, including, variations, in, rainfall, ground, and, surface, water, levels, and, glacial, melt, causing, additional, expenditure, for, the, extra, capacity, to, ensure, sufficient, power, is, available, in, low, water, years, once, completed, if, it, is, well, designed, and, maintained, a, hydroelectric, power, source, is, usually, comparatively, cheap, and, reliable, it, has, no, fuel, and, low, escape, risk, and, as, an, clean, energy, source, it, is, cheaper, than, both, nuclear, and, wind, power, it, is, more, easily, regulated, to, store, water, as, needed, and, generate, high, power, levels, on, demand, compared, to, wind, power, despite, some, positive, effects, the, construction, of, dams, severely, affects, river, ecosystems, leading, to, degraded, riverine, ecosystems, as, part, of, the, hydrological, alteration, one, of, the, main, ways, to, reduce, the, negative, impacts, of, reservoirs, and, dams, is, to, implement, the, newest, nature, based, reservoir, optimization, model, for, resolving, the, conflict, in, human, water, demand, and, riverine, ecosystem, protection, water, and, sediment, flows, can, be, re, established, by, removing, dams, from, a, river, dam, removal, is, considered, appropriate, when, the, dam, is, old, and, maintenance, costs, exceed, the, expense, of, its, removal, some, effects, of, dam, removal, include, erosion, of, sediment, in, the, reservoir, increased, sediment, supply, downstream, increased, river, width, and, braiding, re, establishment, of, natural, water, temperatures, and, recolonisation, of, habitats, that, were, previously, unavailable, due, to, dams, the, world, s, largest, dam, removal, occurred, on, the, elwha, river, in, the, u, s, state, of, washington, see, restoration, of, the, elwha, river, two, dams, the, elwha, and, glynes, canyon, dams, were, removed, between, 2011, and, 2014, that, together, stored, approximately, 30, mt, of, sediment, as, a, result, the, delivery, of, sediment, and, wood, to, the, downstream, river, and, delta, were, re, established, approximately, 65, of, the, sediment, stored, in, the, reservoirs, eroded, of, which, 10, was, deposited, in, the, riverbed, the, remaining, 90, was, transported, to, the, coast, in, total, renewed, sediment, delivery, caused, approximately, 60, ha, of, delta, growth, and, also, resulted, in, increased, river, braiding, dam, failures, are, generally, catastrophic, if, the, structure, is, breached, or, significantly, damaged, routine, deformation, monitoring, and, monitoring, of, seepage, from, drains, in, and, around, larger, dams, is, useful, to, anticipate, any, problems, and, permit, remedial, action, to, be, taken, before, structural, failure, occurs, most, dams, incorporate, mechanisms, to, permit, the, reservoir, to, be, lowered, or, even, drained, in, the, event, of, such, problems, another, solution, can, be, rock, grouting, pressure, pumping, portland, cement, slurry, into, weak, fractured, rock, during, an, armed, conflict, a, dam, is, to, be, considered, as, an, installation, containing, dangerous, forces, due, to, the, massive, impact, of, possible, destruction, on, the, civilian, population, and, the, environment, as, such, it, is, protected, by, the, rules, of, international, humanitarian, law, ihl, and, shall, not, be, made, the, object, of, attack, if, that, may, cause, severe, losses, among, the, civilian, population, to, facilitate, the, identification, a, protective, sign, consisting, of, three, bright, orange, circles, placed, on, the, same, axis, is, defined, by, the, rules, of, ihl, the, main, causes, of, dam, failure, include, inadequate, spillway, capacity, piping, through, the, embankment, foundation, or, abutments, spillway, design, error, south, fork, dam, geological, instability, caused, by, changes, to, water, levels, during, filling, or, poor, surveying, vajont, malpasset, testalinden, creek, dams, poor, maintenance, especially, of, outlet, pipes, lawn, lake, dam, val, di, stava, dam, collapse, extreme, rainfall, shakidor, dam, earthquakes, and, human, computer, or, design, error, buffalo, creek, flood, dale, dike, reservoir, taum, sauk, pumped, storage, plant, a, notable, case, of, deliberate, dam, failure, prior, to, the, above, ruling, was, the, royal, air, force, dambusters, raid, on, germany, in, world, war, ii, codenamed, operation, chastise, in, which, three, german, dams, were, selected, to, be, breached, in, order, to, damage, german, infrastructure, and, manufacturing, and, power, capabilities, deriving, from, the, ruhr, and, eder, rivers, this, raid, later, became, the, basis, for, several, films, since, 2007, the, dutch, ijkdijk, foundation, is, developing, with, an, open, innovation, model, and, early, warning, system, for, levee, dike, failures, as, a, part, of, the, development, effort, full, scale, dikes, are, destroyed, in, the, ijkdijk, fieldlab, the, destruction, process, is, monitored, by, sensor, networks, from, an, international, group, of, companies, and, scientific, institutions
