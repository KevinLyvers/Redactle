the, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, nasa, n, s, is, an, independent, agency, of, the, u, s, federal, government, responsible, for, the, civil, space, program, aeronautics, research, and, space, research, established, in, 1958, it, succeeded, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, naca, to, give, the, u, s, space, development, effort, a, distinct, civilian, orientation, emphasizing, peaceful, applications, in, space, science, it, has, since, led, most, of, america, s, space, exploration, programs, including, project, mercury, project, gemini, the, 1968, 1972, apollo, moon, landing, missions, the, skylab, space, station, and, the, space, shuttle, currently, nasa, supports, the, international, space, station, iss, along, with, the, commercial, crew, program, and, oversees, the, development, of, the, orion, spacecraft, and, the, space, launch, system, for, the, lunar, artemis, program, nasa, s, science, division, is, focused, on, better, understanding, earth, through, the, earth, observing, system, advancing, heliophysics, through, the, efforts, of, the, science, mission, directorate, s, heliophysics, research, program, exploring, bodies, throughout, the, solar, system, with, advanced, robotic, spacecraft, such, as, new, horizons, and, planetary, rovers, such, as, perseverance, and, researching, astrophysics, topics, such, as, the, big, bang, through, the, james, webb, space, telescope, the, four, great, observatories, and, associated, programs, the, launch, services, program, oversees, launch, operations, for, its, uncrewed, launches, nasa, traces, its, roots, to, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, naca, despite, being, the, birthplace, of, aviation, by, 1914, the, united, states, recognized, that, it, was, far, behind, europe, in, aviation, capability, determined, to, regain, american, leadership, in, aviation, the, united, states, congress, created, the, aviation, section, of, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, in, 1914, and, established, naca, in, 1915, to, foster, aeronautical, research, and, development, over, the, next, forty, years, naca, would, conduct, aeronautical, research, in, support, of, the, u, s, air, force, u, s, army, u, s, navy, and, the, civil, aviation, sector, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, naca, became, interested, in, the, possibilities, of, guided, missiles, and, supersonic, aircraft, developing, and, testing, the, bell, x, 1, in, a, joint, program, with, the, u, s, air, force, naca, s, interest, in, space, grew, out, of, its, rocketry, program, at, the, pilotless, aircraft, research, division, the, soviet, union, s, launch, of, sputnik, 1, ushered, in, the, space, age, and, kicked, off, the, space, race, despite, naca, s, early, rocketry, program, the, responsibility, for, launching, the, first, american, satellite, fell, to, the, naval, research, laboratory, s, project, vanguard, whose, operational, issues, ensured, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, would, launch, explorer, 1, america, s, first, satellite, on, february, 1, 1958, the, eisenhower, administration, decided, to, split, the, united, states, military, and, civil, spaceflight, programs, which, were, organized, together, under, the, defense, department, s, advanced, research, projects, agency, nasa, was, established, on, july, 29, 1958, with, the, signing, of, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, act, and, it, began, operations, on, october, 1, 1958, as, the, united, states, premier, aeronautics, agency, naca, formed, the, core, of, nasa, s, new, structure, by, reassigning, 8, 000, employees, and, three, major, research, laboratories, nasa, also, proceeded, to, absorb, the, naval, research, laboratory, s, project, vanguard, the, army, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, jpl, and, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, under, wernher, von, braun, this, left, nasa, firmly, as, the, united, states, civil, space, lead, and, the, air, force, as, the, military, space, lead, plans, for, human, spaceflight, began, in, the, u, s, armed, forces, prior, to, nasa, s, creation, the, air, force, s, man, in, space, soonest, project, formed, in, 1956, coupled, with, the, army, s, project, adam, served, as, the, foundation, for, project, mercury, nasa, established, the, space, task, group, to, manage, the, program, which, would, conduct, crewed, sub, orbital, flights, with, the, army, s, redstone, rockets, and, orbital, flights, with, the, air, force, s, atlas, launch, vehicles, while, nasa, intended, for, its, first, astronauts, to, be, civilians, president, eisenhower, directed, that, they, be, selected, from, the, military, the, mercury, 7, astronauts, included, three, air, force, pilots, three, navy, aviators, and, one, marine, corps, pilot, on, may, 5, 1961, alan, shepard, became, the, first, american, to, enter, space, performing, a, suborbital, spaceflight, in, the, freedom, 7, this, flight, occurred, less, than, a, month, after, the, soviet, yuri, gagarin, became, the, first, human, in, space, executing, a, full, orbital, spaceflight, nasa, s, first, orbital, spaceflight, was, conducted, by, john, glenn, on, february, 20, 1962, in, the, friendship, 7, making, three, full, orbits, before, reentering, glenn, had, to, fly, parts, of, his, final, two, orbits, manually, due, to, an, autopilot, malfunction, the, sixth, and, final, mercury, mission, was, flown, by, gordon, cooper, in, may, 1963, performing, 22, orbits, over, 34, hours, in, the, faith, 7, the, mercury, program, was, wildly, recognized, as, a, resounding, success, achieving, its, objectives, to, orbit, a, human, in, space, develop, tracking, and, control, systems, and, identify, other, issues, associated, with, human, spaceflight, while, much, of, nasa, s, attention, turned, to, space, it, did, not, put, aside, its, aeronautics, mission, early, aeronautics, research, attempted, to, build, upon, the, x, 1, s, supersonic, flight, to, build, an, aircraft, capable, of, hypersonic, flight, the, north, american, x, 15, was, a, joint, nasa, u, s, air, force, program, with, the, hypersonic, test, aircraft, becoming, the, first, non, dedicated, spacecraft, to, cross, from, the, atmosphere, to, outer, space, the, x, 15, also, served, as, a, testbed, for, apollo, program, technologies, as, well, as, ramjet, and, scramjet, propulsion, escalations, in, the, cold, war, between, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, prompted, president, john, f, kennedy, to, charge, nasa, with, landing, an, american, on, the, moon, and, returning, him, safely, to, earth, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, and, installed, james, e, webb, as, nasa, administrator, to, achieve, this, goal, on, may, 25, 1961, president, kennedy, openly, declared, this, goal, in, his, urgent, national, needs, speech, to, the, united, states, congress, declaring, i, believe, this, nation, should, commit, itself, to, achieving, the, goal, before, this, decade, is, out, of, landing, a, man, on, the, moon, and, returning, him, safely, to, earth, no, single, space, project, in, this, period, will, be, more, impressive, to, mankind, or, more, important, for, the, long, range, exploration, of, space, and, none, will, be, so, difficult, or, expensive, to, accomplish, kennedy, gave, his, we, choose, to, go, to, the, moon, speech, the, next, year, on, september, 12, 1962, at, rice, university, where, he, addressed, the, nation, hoping, to, reinforce, public, support, for, the, apollo, program, despite, attacks, on, the, goal, of, landing, astronauts, on, the, moon, from, the, former, president, dwight, eisenhower, and, 1964, presidential, candidate, barry, goldwater, president, kennedy, was, able, to, protect, nasa, s, growing, budget, of, which, 50, went, directly, to, human, spaceflight, and, it, was, later, estimated, that, at, its, height, 5, of, americans, worked, on, some, aspect, of, the, apollo, program, mirroring, the, department, of, defense, s, program, management, concept, using, redundant, systems, in, building, the, first, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, nasa, requested, the, air, force, assign, major, general, samuel, c, phillips, to, the, space, agency, where, he, would, serve, as, the, director, of, the, apollo, program, development, of, the, saturn, v, rocket, was, led, by, wernher, von, braun, and, his, team, at, the, marshall, space, flight, center, derived, from, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, s, original, saturn, i, the, apollo, spacecraft, was, designed, and, built, by, north, american, aviation, while, the, apollo, lunar, module, was, designed, and, built, by, grumman, to, develop, the, spaceflight, skills, and, equipment, required, for, a, lunar, mission, nasa, initiated, project, gemini, using, a, modified, air, force, titan, ii, launch, vehicle, the, gemini, capsule, could, hold, two, astronauts, for, flights, of, over, two, weeks, gemini, pioneered, the, use, of, fuel, cells, instead, of, batteries, and, conducted, the, first, american, spacewalks, and, rendezvous, operations, the, ranger, program, was, started, in, the, 1950s, as, a, response, to, soviet, lunar, exploration, however, most, missions, ended, in, failure, the, lunar, orbiter, program, had, greater, success, mapping, the, surface, in, preparation, for, apollo, landings, and, measured, selenography, conducted, meteoroid, detection, and, measured, radiation, levels, the, surveyor, program, conducted, uncrewed, lunar, landings, and, takeoffs, as, well, as, taking, surface, and, regolith, observations, despite, the, setback, caused, by, the, apollo, 1, fire, which, killed, three, astronauts, the, program, proceeded, apollo, 8, was, the, first, crewed, spacecraft, to, leave, low, earth, orbit, and, the, first, human, spaceflight, to, reach, the, moon, the, crew, orbited, the, moon, ten, times, on, december, 24, and, 25, 1968, and, then, traveled, safely, back, to, earth, the, three, apollo, 8, astronauts, frank, borman, james, lovell, and, william, anders, were, the, first, humans, to, see, the, earth, as, a, globe, in, space, the, first, to, witness, an, earthrise, and, the, first, to, see, and, manually, photograph, the, far, side, of, the, moon, the, first, lunar, landing, was, conducted, by, apollo, 11, commanded, by, neil, armstrong, with, astronauts, buzz, aldrin, and, michael, collins, apollo, 11, was, one, of, the, most, significant, missions, in, nasa, s, history, marking, the, end, of, the, space, race, when, the, soviet, union, gave, up, its, lunar, ambitions, as, the, first, human, to, step, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, neil, armstrong, uttered, the, now, famous, words, that, s, one, small, step, for, man, one, giant, leap, for, mankind, nasa, would, conduct, six, total, lunar, landings, as, part, of, the, apollo, program, with, apollo, 17, concluding, the, program, in, 1972, wernher, von, braun, had, advocated, for, nasa, to, develop, a, space, station, since, the, agency, was, created, in, 1973, following, the, end, of, the, apollo, lunar, missions, nasa, launched, its, first, space, station, skylab, on, the, final, launch, of, the, saturn, v, skylab, reused, a, significant, amount, of, apollo, and, saturn, hardware, with, a, repurposed, saturn, v, third, stage, serving, as, the, primary, module, for, the, space, station, damage, to, skylab, during, its, launch, required, spacewalks, to, be, performed, by, the, first, crew, to, make, it, habitable, and, operational, skylab, hosted, nine, missions, and, was, decommissioned, in, 1974, and, deorbited, in, 1979, two, years, prior, to, the, first, launch, of, the, space, shuttle, and, any, possibility, of, boosting, its, orbit, in, 1975, the, apollo, soyuz, mission, was, the, first, ever, international, spaceflight, and, a, major, diplomatic, accomplishment, between, the, cold, war, rivals, which, also, marked, the, last, flight, of, the, apollo, capsule, flown, in, 1975, a, u, s, apollo, spacecraft, docked, with, a, soviet, soyuz, capsule, during, the, 1960s, nasa, started, its, space, science, and, interplanetary, probe, program, the, mariner, program, was, its, flagship, program, launching, probes, to, venus, mars, and, mercury, in, the, 1960s, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, was, the, lead, nasa, center, for, robotic, interplanetary, exploration, making, significant, discoveries, about, the, inner, planets, despite, these, successes, congress, was, unwilling, to, fund, further, interplanetary, missions, and, nasa, administrator, james, webb, suspended, all, future, interplanetary, probes, to, focus, resources, on, the, apollo, program, following, the, conclusion, of, the, apollo, program, nasa, resumed, launching, interplanetary, probes, and, expanded, its, space, science, program, the, first, planet, tagged, for, exploration, was, venus, sharing, many, similar, characteristics, to, earth, first, visited, by, american, mariner, 2, spacecraft, venus, was, observed, to, be, a, hot, and, inhospitable, planet, follow, on, missions, included, the, pioneer, venus, project, in, the, 1970s, and, magellan, which, performed, radar, mapping, of, venus, surface, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, future, missions, were, flybys, of, venus, on, their, way, to, other, destinations, in, the, solar, system, mars, has, long, been, a, planet, of, intense, fascination, for, nasa, being, suspected, of, potentially, having, harbored, life, mariner, 5, was, the, first, nasa, spacecraft, to, flyby, mars, followed, by, mariner, 6, and, mariner, 7, mariner, 9, was, the, first, orbital, mission, to, mars, launched, in, 1975, viking, program, consisted, of, two, landings, on, mars, in, 1976, follow, on, missions, would, not, be, launched, until, 1996, with, the, mars, global, surveyor, orbiter, and, mars, pathfinder, deploying, the, first, mars, rover, sojourner, during, the, early, 2000s, the, 2001, mars, odyssey, orbiter, reached, the, planet, and, in, 2004, the, sprit, and, opportunity, rovers, landed, on, the, red, planet, this, was, followed, in, 2005, by, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, and, 2007, phoenix, mars, lander, the, 2012, landing, of, curiosity, discovered, that, the, radiation, levels, on, mars, were, equal, to, those, on, the, international, space, station, greatly, increasing, the, possibility, of, human, exploration, and, observed, the, key, chemical, ingredients, for, life, to, occur, in, 2013, the, mars, atmosphere, and, volatile, evolution, maven, mission, observed, the, martian, upper, atmosphere, and, space, environment, and, in, 2018, the, interior, exploration, using, seismic, investigations, geodesy, and, heat, transport, insight, studied, the, martian, interior, the, 2021, perseverance, rover, carried, the, first, extraplanetary, aircraft, a, helicopter, named, ingenuity, nasa, also, launched, missions, to, mercury, in, 2004, with, the, messenger, probe, demonstrating, as, the, first, use, of, a, solar, sail, nasa, also, launched, probes, to, the, outer, solar, system, starting, in, the, 1960s, pioneer, 10, was, the, first, probe, to, the, outer, planets, flying, by, jupiter, while, pioneer, 11, provided, the, first, close, up, view, of, the, planet, both, probes, became, the, first, objects, to, leave, the, solar, system, the, voyager, program, launched, in, 1977, conducting, flybys, of, jupiter, and, saturn, neptune, and, uranus, on, a, trajectory, to, leave, the, solar, system, the, galileo, spacecraft, deployed, from, the, space, shuttle, flight, sts, 34, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, orbit, jupiter, discovering, evidence, of, subsurface, oceans, on, the, europa, and, observed, that, the, moon, may, hold, ice, or, liquid, water, a, joint, nasa, european, space, agency, italian, space, agency, mission, cassini, huygens, was, sent, to, saturn, s, moon, titan, which, along, with, mars, and, europa, are, the, only, celestial, bodies, in, the, solar, system, suspected, of, being, capable, of, harboring, life, cassini, discovered, three, new, moons, of, saturn, and, the, huygens, probe, entered, titan, s, atmosphere, the, mission, discovered, evidence, of, liquid, hydrocarbon, lakes, on, titan, and, subsurface, water, oceans, on, the, moon, of, enceladus, which, could, harbor, life, finally, launched, in, 2006, the, new, horizons, mission, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, visit, pluto, and, the, kuiper, belt, beyond, interplanetary, probes, nasa, has, launched, many, space, telescopes, launched, in, the, 1960s, the, orbiting, astronomical, observatory, were, nasa, s, first, orbital, telescopes, providing, ultraviolet, gamma, ray, x, ray, and, infrared, observations, nasa, launched, the, orbiting, geophysical, observatory, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, to, look, down, at, earth, and, observe, its, interactions, with, the, sun, the, uhuru, satellite, was, the, first, dedicated, x, ray, telescope, mapping, 85, of, the, sky, and, discovering, a, large, number, of, black, holes, launched, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, the, great, observatories, program, are, among, nasa, s, most, powerful, telescopes, the, hubble, space, telescope, was, launched, in, 1990, on, sts, 31, from, the, discovery, and, could, view, galaxies, 15, billion, light, years, away, a, major, defect, in, the, telescope, s, mirror, could, have, crippled, the, program, had, nasa, not, used, computer, enhancement, to, compensate, for, the, imperfection, and, launched, five, space, shuttle, servicing, flights, to, replace, the, damaged, components, the, compton, gamma, ray, observatory, was, launched, from, the, atlantis, on, sts, 37, in, 1991, discovering, a, possible, source, of, antimatter, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, and, observing, that, the, majority, of, gamma, ray, bursts, occur, outside, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, was, launched, from, the, columbia, on, sts, 93, in, 1999, observing, black, holes, quasars, supernova, and, dark, matter, it, provided, critical, observations, on, the, sagittarius, a, black, hole, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, the, separation, of, dark, and, regular, matter, during, galactic, collisions, finally, the, spitzer, space, telescope, is, an, infrared, telescope, launched, in, 2003, from, a, delta, ii, rocket, it, is, in, a, trailing, orbit, around, the, sun, following, the, earth, and, discovered, the, existence, of, brown, dwarf, stars, other, telescopes, such, as, the, cosmic, background, explorer, and, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, provided, evidence, to, support, the, big, bang, the, james, webb, space, telescope, named, after, the, nasa, administrator, who, lead, the, apollo, program, is, an, infrared, observatory, launched, in, 2021, the, james, webb, space, telescope, is, a, direct, successor, to, the, hubble, space, telescope, intended, to, observe, the, formation, of, the, first, galaxies, other, space, telescopes, include, the, kepler, space, telescope, launched, in, 2009, to, identify, planets, orbiting, extrasolar, stars, that, may, be, terran, and, possibly, harbor, life, the, first, exoplanet, that, the, keplar, space, telescope, confirmed, was, kepler, 22b, orbiting, within, the, habitable, zone, of, its, star, nasa, also, launched, a, number, of, different, satellites, to, study, earth, such, as, television, infrared, observation, satellite, tiros, in, 1960, which, was, the, first, weather, satellite, nasa, and, the, united, states, weather, bureau, cooperated, on, future, tiros, and, the, second, generation, nimbus, program, of, weather, satellites, it, also, worked, with, the, environmental, science, services, administration, on, a, series, of, weather, satellites, and, the, agency, launched, its, experimental, applications, technology, satellites, into, geosynchronous, orbit, nasa, s, first, dedicated, earth, observation, satellite, landsat, was, launched, in, 1972, this, led, to, nasa, and, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, jointly, developing, the, geostationary, operational, environmental, satellite, and, discovering, ozone, depletion, nasa, had, been, pursuing, spaceplane, development, since, the, 1960s, blending, the, administration, s, dual, aeronautics, and, space, missions, nasa, viewed, a, spaceplane, as, part, of, a, larger, program, providing, routine, and, economical, logistical, support, to, a, space, station, in, earth, orbit, that, would, be, used, as, a, hub, for, lunar, and, mars, missions, a, reusable, launch, vehicle, would, then, have, ended, the, need, for, expensive, and, expendable, boosters, like, the, saturn, v, in, 1969, nasa, designated, the, johnson, space, center, as, the, lead, center, for, the, design, development, and, manufacturing, of, the, space, shuttle, orbiter, while, the, marshall, space, flight, center, would, lead, the, development, of, the, launch, system, nasa, s, series, of, lifting, body, aircraft, culminating, in, the, joint, nasa, u, s, air, force, martin, marietta, x, 24, directly, informed, the, development, of, the, space, shuttle, and, future, hypersonic, flight, aircraft, official, development, of, the, space, shuttle, began, in, 1972, with, rockwell, international, contracted, to, design, the, orbiter, and, engines, martin, marietta, for, the, external, fuel, tank, and, morton, thiokol, for, the, solid, rocket, boosters, nasa, acquired, six, orbiters, the, enterprise, columbia, challenger, discovery, atlantis, and, endeavour, the, space, shuttle, program, also, allowed, nasa, to, make, major, changes, to, its, astronaut, corps, while, almost, all, previous, astronauts, were, air, force, or, naval, test, pilots, the, space, shuttle, allowed, nasa, to, begin, recruiting, more, non, military, scientific, and, technical, experts, a, prime, example, is, sally, ride, who, became, the, first, american, woman, to, fly, in, space, on, sts, 7, this, new, astronaut, selection, process, also, allowed, nasa, to, accept, exchange, astronauts, from, u, s, allies, and, partners, for, the, first, time, the, first, space, shuttle, flight, occurred, in, 1981, when, the, columbia, launched, on, the, sts, 1, mission, designed, to, serve, as, a, flight, test, for, the, new, spaceplane, nasa, intended, for, the, space, shuttle, to, replace, expendable, launch, systems, like, the, air, force, s, atlas, delta, and, titan, and, the, european, space, agency, s, ariane, the, space, shuttle, s, spacelab, payload, developed, by, the, european, space, agency, increased, the, scientific, capabilities, of, shuttle, missions, over, anything, nasa, was, able, to, previously, accomplish, nasa, launched, its, first, commercial, satellites, on, the, sts, 5, mission, and, in, 1984, the, sts, 41, c, mission, conducted, the, world, s, first, on, orbit, satellite, servicing, mission, when, the, challenger, captured, and, repaired, the, malfunctioning, solar, maximum, mission, satellite, it, also, had, the, capability, to, return, malfunctioning, satellite, to, earth, like, it, did, with, the, palapa, b2, and, westar, 6, satellites, once, returned, to, earth, the, satellites, were, repaired, and, relaunched, despite, ushering, in, a, new, era, of, spaceflight, where, nasa, was, contracting, launch, services, to, commercial, companies, the, space, shuttle, was, criticized, for, not, being, as, reusable, and, cost, effective, as, advertised, in, 1986, challenger, disaster, on, the, sts, 51l, mission, resulted, in, the, loss, of, the, spacecraft, and, all, seven, astronauts, on, launch, grounding, the, entire, space, shuttle, fleet, for, 36, months, and, forced, the, 44, commercial, companies, that, contracted, with, nasa, to, deploy, their, satellites, to, return, to, expendable, launch, vehicles, when, the, space, shuttle, returned, to, flight, with, the, sts, 26, mission, it, had, undergone, significant, modifications, to, improve, its, reliability, and, safety, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, the, russian, federation, and, united, states, initiated, the, shuttle, mir, program, the, first, russian, cosmonaut, flew, on, the, sts, 60, mission, in, 1994, and, the, discovery, rendezvoused, but, did, not, dock, with, the, russian, mir, in, the, sts, 63, mission, this, was, followed, by, atlantis, sts, 71, mission, where, it, accomplished, the, initial, intended, mission, for, the, space, shuttle, docking, with, a, space, station, and, transferring, supplies, and, personnel, the, shuttle, mir, program, would, continue, until, 1998, when, a, series, of, orbital, accidents, on, the, space, station, spelled, an, end, to, the, program, in, 2003, a, second, space, shuttle, was, destroyed, when, the, columbia, was, destroyed, upon, reentry, during, the, sts, 107, mission, resulting, in, the, loss, of, the, spacecraft, and, all, seven, astronauts, this, accident, marked, the, beginning, of, the, retiring, of, the, space, shuttle, program, with, president, george, w, bush, directing, that, upon, the, completion, of, the, international, space, station, the, space, shuttle, be, retired, in, 2006, the, space, shuttle, returned, to, flight, conducting, several, mission, to, service, the, hubble, space, telescope, but, was, retired, following, the, sts, 135, resupply, mission, to, the, international, space, station, in, 2011, nasa, never, gave, up, on, the, idea, of, a, space, station, after, skylab, s, reentry, in, 1979, the, agency, began, lobbying, politicians, to, support, building, a, larger, space, station, as, soon, as, the, space, shuttle, began, flying, selling, it, as, an, orbital, laboratory, repair, station, and, a, jumping, off, point, for, lunar, and, mars, missions, nasa, found, a, strong, advocate, in, president, ronald, reagan, who, declared, in, a, 1984, speech, america, has, always, been, greatest, when, we, dared, to, be, great, we, can, reach, for, greatness, again, we, can, follow, our, dreams, to, distant, stars, living, and, working, in, space, for, peaceful, economic, and, scientific, gain, tonight, i, am, directing, nasa, to, develop, a, permanently, manned, space, station, and, to, do, it, within, a, decade, in, 1985, nasa, proposed, the, space, station, freedom, which, both, the, agency, and, president, reagan, intended, to, be, an, international, program, while, this, would, add, legitimacy, to, the, program, there, were, concerns, within, nasa, that, the, international, component, would, dilute, its, authority, within, the, project, having, never, been, willing, to, work, with, domestic, or, international, partners, as, true, equals, there, was, also, a, concern, with, sharing, sensitive, space, technologies, with, the, europeans, which, had, the, potential, to, dilute, america, s, technical, lead, ultimately, an, international, agreement, to, develop, the, space, station, freedom, program, would, be, signed, with, thirteen, countries, in, 1985, including, the, european, space, agency, member, states, canada, and, japan, despite, its, status, as, the, first, international, space, program, the, space, station, freedom, was, controversial, with, much, of, the, debate, centering, on, cost, several, redesigns, to, reduce, cost, were, conducted, in, the, early, 1990s, stripping, away, much, of, its, functions, despite, calls, for, congress, to, terminate, the, program, it, continued, in, large, part, because, by, 1992, it, had, created, 75, 000, jobs, across, 39, states, by, 1993, president, bill, clinton, attempted, to, significantly, reduce, nasa, s, budget, and, directed, costs, be, significantly, reduced, aerospace, industry, jobs, were, not, lost, and, the, russians, be, included, in, 1993, the, clinton, administration, announced, that, the, space, station, freedom, would, become, the, international, space, station, in, an, agreement, with, the, russian, federation, this, allowed, the, russians, to, maintain, their, space, program, through, an, infusion, of, american, currency, to, maintain, their, status, as, one, of, the, two, premier, space, programs, while, the, united, states, built, and, launched, the, majority, of, the, international, space, station, russia, canada, japan, and, the, european, space, agency, all, contributed, components, despite, nasa, s, insistence, that, costs, would, be, kept, at, a, budget, of, 17, 4, they, kept, rising, and, nasa, had, to, transfer, funds, from, other, programs, to, keep, the, international, space, station, solvent, ultimately, the, total, cost, of, the, station, was, 150, billion, with, the, united, states, paying, for, two, thirds, following, the, space, shuttle, columbia, disaster, in, 2003, nasa, was, forced, to, rely, on, russian, soyuz, launches, for, its, astronauts, and, the, 2011, retirement, of, the, space, shuttle, accelerated, the, station, s, completion, in, the, 1980s, right, after, the, first, flight, of, the, space, shuttle, nasa, started, a, joint, program, with, the, department, of, defense, to, develop, the, rockwell, x, 30, national, aerospace, plane, nasa, realized, that, the, space, shuttle, while, a, massive, technological, accomplishment, would, not, be, able, to, live, up, to, all, its, promises, designed, to, be, a, single, stage, to, orbit, spaceplane, the, x, 30, had, both, civil, and, military, applications, with, the, end, of, the, cold, war, the, x, 30, was, canceled, in, 1992, before, reaching, flight, status, following, the, space, shuttle, columbia, disaster, in, 2003, president, bush, started, the, constellation, program, to, smoothly, replace, the, space, shuttle, and, expand, space, exploration, beyond, low, earth, orbit, constellation, was, intended, to, use, a, significant, amount, of, former, space, shuttle, equipment, and, return, astronauts, to, the, moon, this, program, was, canceled, by, the, obama, administration, former, astronauts, neil, armstrong, gene, cernan, and, jim, lovell, sent, a, letter, to, president, barack, obama, to, warn, him, that, if, the, united, states, did, not, get, new, human, spaceflight, ability, the, u, s, risked, become, a, second, or, third, rate, space, power, as, early, as, the, reagan, administration, there, had, been, calls, for, nasa, to, expand, private, sector, involvement, in, space, exploration, rather, than, do, it, all, in, house, in, the, 1990s, nasa, and, lockheed, martin, entered, into, an, agreement, to, develop, the, lockheed, martin, x, 33, demonstrator, of, the, venturestar, spaceplane, which, was, intended, to, replace, the, space, shuttle, due, to, technical, challenges, the, spacecraft, was, cancelled, in, 2001, despite, this, it, was, the, first, time, a, commercial, space, company, directly, expended, a, significant, amount, of, its, resources, into, spacecraft, development, the, advent, of, space, tourism, also, forced, nasa, to, challenge, its, assumption, that, only, governments, would, have, people, in, space, the, first, space, tourist, was, dennis, tito, an, american, investment, manager, and, former, aerospace, engineer, who, contracted, with, the, russians, to, fly, to, the, international, space, station, for, four, days, despite, the, opposition, of, nasa, to, the, idea, advocates, of, this, new, commercial, approach, for, nasa, included, former, astronaut, buzz, aldrin, who, remarked, that, it, would, return, nasa, to, its, roots, as, a, research, and, development, agency, with, commercial, entities, actually, operating, the, space, systems, having, corporations, take, over, orbital, operations, would, also, allow, nasa, to, focus, all, its, efforts, on, deep, space, exploration, and, returning, humans, to, the, moon, and, going, to, mars, embracing, this, approach, nasa, s, commercial, crew, program, started, by, contracting, cargo, delivery, to, the, international, space, station, and, flew, its, first, operational, contracted, mission, on, spacex, crew, 1, this, marked, the, first, time, since, the, retirement, of, the, space, shuttle, that, nasa, was, able, to, launch, its, own, astronauts, on, an, american, spacecraft, from, the, united, states, ending, a, decade, of, reliance, on, the, russians, in, 2019, nasa, announced, the, artemis, program, intending, to, return, to, the, moon, and, establish, a, permanent, human, presence, this, was, paired, with, the, artemis, accords, with, partner, nations, to, establish, rules, of, behavior, and, norms, of, space, commercialization, on, the, moon, in, 2023, nasa, established, the, moon, to, mars, program, office, the, office, is, designed, to, oversee, the, various, projects, mission, architectures, and, associated, timelines, relevant, to, lunar, and, mars, exploration, and, science, the, international, space, station, iss, combines, nasa, s, space, station, freedom, project, with, the, russian, mir, 2, station, the, european, columbus, station, and, the, japanese, kib, laboratory, module, nasa, originally, planned, in, the, 1980s, to, develop, freedom, alone, but, us, budget, constraints, led, to, the, merger, of, these, projects, into, a, single, multi, national, program, in, 1993, managed, by, nasa, the, russian, federal, space, agency, rka, the, japan, aerospace, exploration, agency, jaxa, the, european, space, agency, esa, and, the, canadian, space, agency, csa, the, station, consists, of, pressurized,
