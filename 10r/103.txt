the, internet, protocol, suite, commonly, known, as, tcp, ip, is, a, framework, for, organizing, the, set, of, communication, protocols, used, in, the, internet, and, similar, computer, networks, according, to, functional, criteria, the, foundational, protocols, in, the, suite, are, the, transmission, control, protocol, tcp, the, user, datagram, protocol, udp, and, the, internet, protocol, ip, early, versions, of, this, networking, model, were, known, as, the, department, of, defense, dod, model, because, the, research, and, development, were, funded, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, through, darpa, the, internet, protocol, suite, provides, end, to, end, data, communication, specifying, how, data, should, be, packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and, received, this, functionality, is, organized, into, four, abstraction, layers, which, classify, all, related, protocols, according, to, each, protocol, s, scope, of, networking, an, implementation, of, the, layers, for, a, particular, application, forms, a, protocol, stack, from, lowest, to, highest, the, layers, are, the, link, layer, containing, communication, methods, for, data, that, remains, within, a, single, network, segment, link, the, internet, layer, providing, internetworking, between, independent, networks, the, transport, layer, handling, host, to, host, communication, and, the, application, layer, providing, process, to, process, data, exchange, for, applications, the, technical, standards, underlying, the, internet, protocol, suite, and, its, constituent, protocols, are, maintained, by, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, the, internet, protocol, suite, predates, the, osi, model, a, more, comprehensive, reference, framework, for, general, networking, systems, initially, referred, to, as, the, dod, internet, architecture, model, the, internet, protocol, suite, has, its, roots, in, research, and, development, sponsored, by, the, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, darpa, in, the, late, 1960s, after, darpa, initiated, the, pioneering, arpanet, in, 1969, steve, crocker, established, a, networking, working, group, which, developed, a, host, host, protocol, the, network, control, program, ncp, in, the, early, 1970s, darpa, started, work, on, several, other, data, transmission, technologies, including, mobile, packet, radio, packet, satellite, service, local, area, networks, and, other, data, networks, in, the, public, and, private, domains, in, 1972, bob, kahn, joined, the, darpa, information, processing, technology, office, where, he, worked, on, both, satellite, packet, networks, and, ground, based, radio, packet, networks, and, recognized, the, value, of, being, able, to, communicate, across, both, in, the, spring, of, 1973, vinton, cerf, joined, kahn, with, the, goal, of, designing, the, next, protocol, generation, for, the, arpanet, to, enable, internetworking, they, drew, on, the, experience, from, the, arpanet, research, community, the, international, network, working, group, which, cerf, chaired, and, researchers, at, xerox, parc, by, the, summer, of, 1973, kahn, and, cerf, had, worked, out, a, fundamental, reformulation, in, which, the, differences, between, local, network, protocols, were, hidden, by, using, a, common, internetwork, protocol, and, instead, of, the, network, being, responsible, for, reliability, as, in, the, existing, arpanet, protocols, this, function, was, delegated, to, the, hosts, cerf, credits, louis, pouzin, and, hubert, zimmermann, designers, of, the, cyclades, network, with, important, influences, on, this, design, the, new, protocol, was, implemented, as, the, transmission, control, program, in, 1974, by, cerf, yogen, dalal, and, carl, sunshine, initially, the, transmission, control, program, the, internet, protocol, did, not, then, exist, as, a, separate, protocol, provided, only, a, reliable, byte, stream, service, to, its, users, not, datagrams, several, versions, were, developed, through, the, internet, experiment, note, series, as, experience, with, the, protocol, grew, collaborators, recommended, division, of, functionality, into, layers, of, distinct, protocols, allowing, users, direct, access, to, datagram, service, advocates, included, bob, metcalfe, and, yogen, dalal, at, xerox, parc, danny, cohen, who, needed, it, for, his, packet, voice, work, and, jonathan, postel, of, the, university, of, southern, california, s, information, sciences, institute, who, edited, the, request, for, comments, rfcs, the, technical, and, strategic, document, series, that, has, both, documented, and, catalyzed, internet, development, postel, stated, we, are, screwing, up, in, our, design, of, internet, protocols, by, violating, the, principle, of, layering, encapsulation, of, different, mechanisms, was, intended, to, create, an, environment, where, the, upper, layers, could, access, only, what, was, needed, from, the, lower, layers, a, monolithic, design, would, be, inflexible, and, lead, to, scalability, issues, in, version, 4, written, in, 1978, postel, split, the, transmission, control, program, into, two, distinct, protocols, the, internet, protocol, as, connectionless, layer, and, the, transmission, control, protocol, as, a, reliable, connection, oriented, service, the, design, of, the, network, included, the, recognition, that, it, should, provide, only, the, functions, of, efficiently, transmitting, and, routing, traffic, between, end, nodes, and, that, all, other, intelligence, should, be, located, at, the, edge, of, the, network, in, the, end, nodes, this, design, known, as, the, end, to, end, principle, was, pioneered, by, louis, pouzin, in, the, cyclades, network, using, this, design, it, became, possible, to, connect, other, networks, to, the, arpanet, that, used, the, same, principle, irrespective, of, other, local, characteristics, thereby, solving, kahn, s, initial, internetworking, problem, a, popular, expression, is, that, tcp, ip, the, eventual, product, of, cerf, and, kahn, s, work, can, run, over, two, tin, cans, and, a, string, years, later, as, a, joke, the, ip, over, avian, carriers, formal, protocol, specification, was, created, and, successfully, tested, darpa, contracted, with, bbn, technologies, stanford, university, and, the, university, college, london, to, develop, operational, versions, of, the, protocol, on, several, hardware, platforms, during, development, of, the, protocol, the, version, number, of, the, packet, routing, layer, progressed, from, version, 1, to, version, 4, the, latter, of, which, was, installed, in, the, arpanet, in, 1983, it, became, known, as, internet, protocol, version, 4, ipv4, as, the, protocol, that, is, still, in, use, in, the, internet, alongside, its, current, successor, internet, protocol, version, 6, ipv6, in, 1975, a, two, network, ip, communications, test, was, performed, between, stanford, and, university, college, london, in, november, 1977, a, three, network, ip, test, was, conducted, between, sites, in, the, us, the, uk, and, norway, several, other, ip, prototypes, were, developed, at, multiple, research, centers, between, 1978, and, 1983, a, computer, called, a, router, is, provided, with, an, interface, to, each, network, it, forwards, network, packets, back, and, forth, between, them, originally, a, router, was, called, gateway, but, the, term, was, changed, to, avoid, confusion, with, other, types, of, gateways, in, march, 1982, the, us, department, of, defense, declared, tcp, ip, as, the, standard, for, all, military, computer, networking, in, the, same, year, norsar, ndre, and, peter, kirstein, s, research, group, at, university, college, london, adopted, the, protocol, the, migration, of, the, arpanet, from, ncp, to, tcp, ip, was, officially, completed, on, flag, day, january, 1, 1983, when, the, new, protocols, were, permanently, activated, in, 1985, the, internet, advisory, board, later, internet, architecture, board, held, a, three, day, tcp, ip, workshop, for, the, computer, industry, attended, by, 250, vendor, representatives, promoting, the, protocol, and, leading, to, its, increasing, commercial, use, in, 1985, the, first, interop, conference, focused, on, network, interoperability, by, broader, adoption, of, tcp, ip, the, conference, was, founded, by, dan, lynch, an, early, internet, activist, from, the, beginning, large, corporations, such, as, ibm, and, dec, attended, the, meeting, ibm, at, t, and, dec, were, the, first, major, corporations, to, adopt, tcp, ip, this, despite, having, competing, proprietary, protocols, in, ibm, from, 1984, barry, appelman, s, group, did, tcp, ip, development, they, navigated, the, corporate, politics, to, get, a, stream, of, tcp, ip, products, for, various, ibm, systems, including, mvs, vm, and, os, 2, at, the, same, time, several, smaller, companies, such, as, ftp, software, and, the, wollongong, group, began, offering, tcp, ip, stacks, for, dos, and, microsoft, windows, the, first, vm, cms, tcp, ip, stack, came, from, the, university, of, wisconsin, some, of, the, early, tcp, ip, stacks, were, written, single, handedly, by, a, few, programmers, jay, elinsky, and, oleg, vishnepolsky, of, ibm, research, wrote, tcp, ip, stacks, for, vm, cms, and, os, 2, respectively, in, 1984, donald, gillies, at, mit, wrote, a, ntcp, multi, connection, tcp, which, runs, atop, the, ip, packetdriver, layer, maintained, by, john, romkey, at, mit, in, 1983, 84, romkey, leveraged, this, tcp, in, 1986, when, ftp, software, was, founded, starting, in, 1985, phil, karn, created, a, multi, connection, tcp, application, for, ham, radio, systems, ka9q, tcp, the, spread, of, tcp, ip, was, fueled, further, in, june, 1989, when, the, university, of, california, berkeley, agreed, to, place, the, tcp, ip, code, developed, for, bsd, unix, into, the, public, domain, various, corporate, vendors, including, ibm, included, this, code, in, commercial, tcp, ip, software, releases, for, windows, 3, 1, the, dominant, pc, operating, system, among, consumers, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1990s, peter, tattam, s, release, of, the, trumpet, winsock, tcp, ip, stack, was, key, to, bringing, the, internet, to, home, users, trumpet, winsock, allowed, tcp, ip, operations, over, a, serial, connection, slip, or, ppp, the, typical, home, pc, of, the, time, had, an, external, hayes, compatible, modem, connected, via, an, rs, 232, port, with, an, 8250, or, 16550, uart, which, required, this, type, of, stack, later, microsoft, would, release, their, own, tcp, ip, add, on, stack, for, windows, for, workgroups, 3, 11, and, a, native, stack, in, windows, 95, these, events, helped, cement, tcp, ip, s, dominance, over, other, protocols, on, microsoft, based, networks, which, included, ibm, s, systems, network, architecture, sna, and, on, other, platforms, such, as, digital, equipment, corporation, s, decnet, open, systems, interconnection, osi, and, xerox, network, systems, xns, nonetheless, for, a, period, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, engineers, organizations, and, nations, were, polarized, over, the, issue, of, which, standard, the, osi, model, or, the, internet, protocol, suite, would, result, in, the, best, and, most, robust, computer, networks, the, technical, standards, underlying, the, internet, protocol, suite, and, its, constituent, protocols, have, been, delegated, to, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, the, characteristic, architecture, of, the, internet, protocol, suite, is, its, broad, division, into, operating, scopes, for, the, protocols, that, constitute, its, core, functionality, the, defining, specification, of, the, suite, is, rfc, 1122, which, broadly, outlines, four, abstraction, layers, these, have, stood, the, test, of, time, as, the, ietf, has, never, modified, this, structure, as, such, a, model, of, networking, the, internet, protocol, suite, predates, the, osi, model, a, more, comprehensive, reference, framework, for, general, networking, systems, the, end, to, end, principle, has, evolved, over, time, its, original, expression, put, the, maintenance, of, state, and, overall, intelligence, at, the, edges, and, assumed, the, internet, that, connected, the, edges, retained, no, state, and, concentrated, on, speed, and, simplicity, real, world, needs, for, firewalls, network, address, translators, web, content, caches, and, the, like, have, forced, changes, in, this, principle, the, robustness, principle, states, in, general, an, implementation, must, be, conservative, in, its, sending, behavior, and, liberal, in, its, receiving, behavior, that, is, it, must, be, careful, to, send, well, formed, datagrams, but, must, accept, any, datagram, that, it, can, interpret, e, g, not, object, to, technical, errors, where, the, meaning, is, still, clear, the, second, part, of, the, principle, is, almost, as, important, software, on, other, hosts, may, contain, deficiencies, that, make, it, unwise, to, exploit, legal, but, obscure, protocol, features, encapsulation, is, used, to, provide, abstraction, of, protocols, and, services, encapsulation, is, usually, aligned, with, the, division, of, the, protocol, suite, into, layers, of, general, functionality, in, general, an, application, the, highest, level, of, the, model, uses, a, set, of, protocols, to, send, its, data, down, the, layers, the, data, is, further, encapsulated, at, each, level, an, early, architectural, document, rfc, 1122, titled, host, requirements, emphasizes, architectural, principles, over, layering, rfc, 1122, is, structured, in, sections, referring, to, layers, but, the, document, refers, to, many, other, architectural, principles, and, does, not, emphasize, layering, it, loosely, defines, a, four, layer, model, with, the, layers, having, names, not, numbers, as, follows, the, protocols, of, the, link, layer, operate, within, the, scope, of, the, local, network, connection, to, which, a, host, is, attached, this, regime, is, called, the, link, in, tcp, ip, parlance, and, is, the, lowest, component, layer, of, the, suite, the, link, includes, all, hosts, accessible, without, traversing, a, router, the, size, of, the, link, is, therefore, determined, by, the, networking, hardware, design, in, principle, tcp, ip, is, designed, to, be, hardware, independent, and, may, be, implemented, on, top, of, virtually, any, link, layer, technology, this, includes, not, only, hardware, implementations, but, also, virtual, link, layers, such, as, virtual, private, networks, and, networking, tunnels, the, link, layer, is, used, to, move, packets, between, the, internet, layer, interfaces, of, two, different, hosts, on, the, same, link, the, processes, of, transmitting, and, receiving, packets, on, the, link, can, be, controlled, in, the, device, driver, for, the, network, card, as, well, as, in, firmware, or, by, specialized, chipsets, these, perform, functions, such, as, framing, to, prepare, the, internet, layer, packets, for, transmission, and, finally, transmit, the, frames, to, the, physical, layer, and, over, a, transmission, medium, the, tcp, ip, model, includes, specifications, for, translating, the, network, addressing, methods, used, in, the, internet, protocol, to, link, layer, addresses, such, as, media, access, control, mac, addresses, all, other, aspects, below, that, level, however, are, implicitly, assumed, to, exist, and, are, not, explicitly, defined, in, the, tcp, ip, model, the, link, layer, in, the, tcp, ip, model, has, corresponding, functions, in, layer, 2, of, the, osi, model, internetworking, requires, sending, data, from, the, source, network, to, the, destination, network, this, process, is, called, routing, and, is, supported, by, host, addressing, and, identification, using, the, hierarchical, ip, addressing, system, the, internet, layer, provides, an, unreliable, datagram, transmission, facility, between, hosts, located, on, potentially, different, ip, networks, by, forwarding, datagrams, to, an, appropriate, next, hop, router, for, further, relaying, to, its, destination, the, internet, layer, has, the, responsibility, of, sending, packets, across, potentially, multiple, networks, with, this, functionality, the, internet, layer, makes, possible, internetworking, the, interworking, of, different, ip, networks, and, it, essentially, establishes, the, internet, the, internet, layer, does, not, distinguish, between, the, various, transport, layer, protocols, ip, carries, data, for, a, variety, of, different, upper, layer, protocols, these, protocols, are, each, identified, by, a, unique, protocol, number, for, example, internet, control, message, protocol, icmp, and, internet, group, management, protocol, igmp, are, protocols, 1, and, 2, respectively, the, internet, protocol, is, the, principal, component, of, the, internet, layer, and, it, defines, two, addressing, systems, to, identify, network, hosts, and, to, locate, them, on, the, network, the, original, address, system, of, the, arpanet, and, its, successor, the, internet, is, internet, protocol, version, 4, ipv4, it, uses, a, 32, bit, ip, address, and, is, therefore, capable, of, identifying, approximately, four, billion, hosts, this, limitation, was, eliminated, in, 1998, by, the, standardization, of, internet, protocol, version, 6, ipv6, which, uses, 128, bit, addresses, ipv6, production, implementations, emerged, in, approximately, 2006, the, transport, layer, establishes, basic, data, channels, that, applications, use, for, task, specific, data, exchange, the, layer, establishes, host, to, host, connectivity, in, the, form, of, end, to, end, message, transfer, services, that, are, independent, of, the, underlying, network, and, independent, of, the, structure, of, user, data, and, the, logistics, of, exchanging, information, connectivity, at, the, transport, layer, can, be, categorized, as, either, connection, oriented, implemented, in, tcp, or, connectionless, implemented, in, udp, the, protocols, in, this, layer, may, provide, error, control, segmentation, flow, control, congestion, control, and, application, addressing, port, numbers, for, the, purpose, of, providing, process, specific, transmission, channels, for, applications, the, layer, establishes, the, concept, of, the, network, port, this, is, a, numbered, logical, construct, allocated, specifically, for, each, of, the, communication, channels, an, application, needs, for, many, types, of, services, these, port, numbers, have, been, standardized, so, that, client, computers, may, address, specific, services, of, a, server, computer, without, the, involvement, of, service, discovery, or, directory, services, because, ip, provides, only, a, best, effort, delivery, some, transport, layer, protocols, offer, reliability, tcp, is, a, connection, oriented, protocol, that, addresses, numerous, reliability, issues, in, providing, a, reliable, byte, stream, the, newer, stream, control, transmission, protocol, sctp, is, also, a, reliable, connection, oriented, transport, mechanism, it, is, message, stream, oriented, not, byte, stream, oriented, like, tcp, and, provides, multiple, streams, multiplexed, over, a, single, connection, it, also, provides, multihoming, support, in, which, a, connection, end, can, be, represented, by, multiple, ip, addresses, representing, multiple, physical, interfaces, such, that, if, one, fails, the, connection, is, not, interrupted, it, was, developed, initially, for, telephony, applications, to, transport, ss7, over, ip, reliability, can, also, be, achieved, by, running, ip, over, a, reliable, data, link, protocol, such, as, the, high, level, data, link, control, hdlc, the, user, datagram, protocol, udp, is, a, connectionless, datagram, protocol, like, ip, it, is, a, best, effort, unreliable, protocol, reliability, is, addressed, through, error, detection, using, a, checksum, algorithm, udp, is, typically, used, for, applications, such, as, streaming, media, audio, video, voice, over, ip, etc, where, on, time, arrival, is, more, important, than, reliability, or, for, simple, query, response, applications, like, dns, lookups, where, the, overhead, of, setting, up, a, reliable, connection, is, disproportionately, large, real, time, transport, protocol, rtp, is, a, datagram, protocol, that, is, used, over, udp, and, is, designed, for, real, time, data, such, as, streaming, media, the, applications, at, any, given, network, address, are, distinguished, by, their, tcp, or, udp, port, by, convention, certain, well, known, ports, are, associated, with, specific, applications, the, tcp, ip, model, s, transport, or, host, to, host, layer, corresponds, roughly, to, the, fourth, layer, in, the, osi, model, also, called, the, transport, layer, quic, is, rapidly, emerging, as, an, alternative, transport, protocol, whilst, it, is, technically, carried, via, udp, packets, it, seeks, to, offer, enhanced, transport, connectivity, relative, to, tcp, http, 3, works, exclusively, via, quic, the, application, layer, includes, the, protocols, used, by, most, applications, for, providing, user, services, or, exchanging, application, data, over, the, network, connections, established, by, the, lower, level, protocols, this, may, include, some, basic, network, support, services, such, as, routing, protocols, and, host, configuration, examples, of, application, layer, protocols, include, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, http, the, file, transfer, protocol, ftp, the, simple, mail, transfer, protocol, smtp, and, the, dynamic, host, configuration, protocol, dhcp, data, coded, according, to, application, layer, protocols, are, encapsulated, into, transport, layer, protocol, units, such, as, tcp, streams, or, udp, datagrams, which, in, turn, use, lower, layer, protocols, to, effect, actual, data, transfer, the, tcp, ip, model, does, not, consider, the, specifics, of, formatting, and, presenting, data, and, does, not, define, additional, layers, between, the, application, and, transport, layers, as, in, the, osi, model, presentation, and, session, layers, according, to, the, tcp, ip, model, such, functions, are, the, realm, of, libraries, and, application, programming, interfaces, the, application, layer, in, the, tcp, ip, model, is, often, compared, to, a, combination, of, the, fifth, session, sixth, presentation, and, seventh, application, layers, of, the, osi, model, application, layer, protocols, are, often, associated, with, particular, client, server, applications, and, common, services, have, well, known, port, numbers, reserved, by, the, internet, assigned, numbers, authority, iana, for, example, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, uses, server, port, 80, and, telnet, uses, server, port, 23, clients, connecting, to, a, service, usually, use, ephemeral, ports, i, e, port, numbers, assigned, only, for, the, duration, of, the, transaction, at, random, or, from, a, specific, range, configured, in, the, application, at, the, application, layer, the, tcp, ip, model, distinguishes, between, user, protocols, and, support, protocols, support, protocols, provide, services, to, a, system, of, network, infrastructure, user, protocols, are, used, for, actual, user, applications, for, example, ftp, is, a, user, protocol, and, dns, is, a, support, protocol, although, the, applications, are, usually, aware, of, key, qualities, of, the, transport, layer, connection, such, as, the, endpoint, ip, addresses, and, port, numbers, application, layer, protocols, generally, treat, the, transport, layer, and, lower, protocols, as, black, boxes, which, provide, a, stable, network, connection, across, which, to, communicate, the, transport, layer, and, lower, level, layers, are, unconcerned, with, the, specifics, of, application, layer, protocols, routers, and, switches, do, not, typically, examine, the, encapsulated, traffic, rather, they, just, provide, a, conduit, for, it, however, some, firewall, and, bandwidth, throttling, applications, use, deep, packet, inspection, to, interpret, application, data, an, example, is, the, resource, reservation, protocol, rsvp, it, is, also, sometimes, necessary, for, applications, affected, by, nat, to, consider, the, application, payload, the, internet, protocol, suite, evolved, through, research, and, development, funded, over, a, period, of, time, in, this, process, the, specifics, of, protocol, components, and, their, layering, changed, in, addition, parallel, research, and, commercial, interests, from, industry, associations, competed, with, design, features, in, particular, efforts, in, the, international, organization, for, standardization, led, to, a, similar, goal, but, with, a, wider, scope, of, networking, in, general, efforts, to, consolidate, the, two, principal, schools, of, layering, which, were, superficially, similar, but, diverged, sharply, in, detail, led, independent, textbook, authors, to, formulate, abridging, teaching, tools, the, following, table, shows, various, such, networking, models, the, number, of, layers, varies, between, three, and, seven, some, of, the, networking, models, are, from, textbooks, which, are, secondary, sources, that, may, conflict, with, the, intent, of, rfc, 1122, and, other, ietf, primary, sources, the, three, top, layers, in, the, osi, model, i, e, the, application, layer, the, presentation, layer, and, the, session, layer, are, not, distinguished, separately, in, the, tcp, ip, model, which, only, has, an, application, layer, above, the, transport, layer, while, some, pure, osi, protocol, applications, such, as, x, 400, also, combined, them, there, is, no, requirement, that, a, tcp, ip, protocol, stack, must, impose, monolithic, architecture, above, the, transport, layer, for, example, the, nfs, application, protocol, runs, over, the, external, data, representation, xdr, presentation, protocol, which, in, turn, runs, over, a, protocol, called, remote, procedure, call, rpc, rpc, provides, reliable, record, transmission, so, it, can, safely, use, the, best, effort, udp, transport, different, authors, have, interpreted, the, tcp, ip, model, differently, and, disagree, whether, the, link, layer, or, any, aspect, of, the, tcp, ip, model, covers, osi, layer, 1, physical, layer, issues, or, whether, tcp, ip, assumes, a, hardware, layer, exists, below, the, link, layer, several, authors, have, attempted, to, incorporate, the, osi, model, s, layers, 1, and, 2, into, the, tcp, ip, model, since, these, are, commonly, referred, to, in, modern, standards, for, example, by, ieee, and, itu, this, often, results, in, a, model, with, five, layers, where, the, link, layer, or, network, access, layer, is, split, into, the, osi, model, s, layers, 1, and, 2, the, ietf, protocol, development, effort, is, not, concerned, with, strict, layering, some, of, its, protocols, may, not, fit, cleanly, into, the, osi, model, although, rfcs, sometimes, refer, to, it, and, often, use, the, old, osi, layer, numbers, the, ietf, has, repeatedly, stated, that, internet, protocol, and, architecture, development, is, not, intended, to, be, osi, compliant, rfc, 3439, referring, to, the, internet, architecture, contains, a, section, entitled, layering, considered, harmful, for, example, the, session, and, presentation, layers, of, the, osi, suite, are, considered, to, be, included, in, the, application, layer, of, the, tcp, ip, suite, the, functionality, of, the, session, layer, can, be, found, in, protocols, like, http, and, smtp, and, is, more, evident, in, protocols, like, telnet, and, the, session, initiation, protocol, sip, session, layer, functionality, is, also, realized, with, the, port, numbering, of, the, tcp, and, udp, protocols, which, are, included, in, the, transport, layer, of, the, tcp, ip, suite, functions, of, the, presentation, layer, are, realized, in, the, tcp, ip, applications, with, the, mime, standard, in, data, exchange, another, difference, is, in, the, treatment, of, routing, protocols, the, osi, routing, protocol, is, is, belongs, to, the, network, layer, and, does, not, depend, on, clns, for, delivering, packets, from, one, router, to, another, but, defines, its, own, layer, 3, encapsulation, in, contrast, ospf, rip, bgp, and, other, routing, protocols, defined, by, the, ietf, are, transported, over, ip, and, for, the, purpose, of, sending, and, receiving, routing, protocol, packets, routers, act, as, hosts, as, a, consequence, rfc, 1812, include, routing, protocols, in, the, application, layer, some, authors, such, as, tanenbaum, in, computer, networks, describe, routing, protocols, in, the, same, layer, as, ip, reasoning, that, routing, protocols, inform, decisions, made, by, the, forwarding, process, of, routers, ietf, protocols, can, be, encapsulated, recursively, as, demonstrated, by, tunnelling, protocols, such, as, generic, routing, encapsulation, gre, gre, uses, the, same, mechanism, that, osi, uses, for, tunnelling, at, the, network, layer, the, internet, protocol, suite, does, not, presume, any, specific, hardware, or, software, environment, it, only, requires, that, hardware, and, a, software, layer, exists, that, is, capable, of, sending, and, receiving, packets, on, a, computer, network, as, a, result, the, suite, has, been, implemented, on, essentially, every, computing, platform, a, minimal, implementation, of, tcp, ip, includes, the, following, internet, protocol, ip, address, resolution, protocol, arp, internet, control, message, protocol, icmp, transmission, control, protocol, tcp, user, datagram, protocol, udp, and, internet, group, management, protocol, igmp, in, addition, to, ip, icmp, tcp, udp, internet, protocol, version, 6, requires, neighbor, discovery, protocol, ndp, icmpv6, and, multicast, listener, discovery, mld, and, is, often, accompanied, by, an, integrated, ipsec, security, layer
