a, battering, ram, is, a, siege, engine, that, originated, in, ancient, times, and, was, designed, to, break, open, the, masonry, walls, of, fortifications, or, splinter, their, wooden, gates, in, its, simplest, form, a, battering, ram, is, just, a, large, heavy, log, carried, by, several, people, and, propelled, with, force, against, an, obstacle, the, ram, would, be, sufficient, to, damage, the, target, if, the, log, were, massive, enough, and, or, it, were, moved, quickly, enough, that, is, if, it, had, enough, momentum, later, rams, encased, the, log, in, an, arrow, proof, fire, resistant, canopy, mounted, on, wheels, inside, the, canopy, the, log, was, swung, from, suspensory, chains, or, ropes, rams, proved, effective, weapons, of, war, because, at, the, time, wall, building, materials, such, as, stone, and, brick, were, weak, in, tension, and, therefore, prone, to, cracking, when, impacted, with, force, with, repeated, blows, the, cracks, would, grow, steadily, until, a, hole, was, created, eventually, a, breach, would, appear, in, the, fabric, of, the, wall, enabling, armed, attackers, to, force, their, way, through, the, gap, and, engage, the, inhabitants, of, the, citadel, the, introduction, in, the, later, middle, ages, of, siege, cannons, which, harnessed, the, explosive, power, of, gunpowder, to, propel, weighty, stone, or, iron, balls, against, fortified, obstacles, spelled, the, end, of, battering, rams, and, other, traditional, siege, weapons, smaller, hand, held, versions, of, battering, rams, are, still, used, today, by, law, enforcement, officers, and, military, personnel, to, break, open, locked, doors, a, capped, ram, is, a, battering, ram, that, has, an, accessory, at, the, head, usually, made, of, iron, or, steel, and, sometimes, punningly, shaped, into, the, head, and, horns, of, an, ovine, ram, to, do, more, damage, to, a, building, it, was, much, more, effective, at, destroying, enemy, walls, and, buildings, than, an, uncapped, ram, but, was, heavier, to, carry, the, earliest, depiction, of, a, possible, battering, ram, is, from, the, tomb, of, the, 11th, dynasty, egyptian, noble, khety, where, a, pair, of, soldiers, advance, towards, a, fortress, under, the, protection, of, a, mobile, roofed, structure, carrying, a, long, pole, that, may, represent, a, simple, battering, ram, during, the, iron, age, in, the, ancient, middle, east, and, mediterranean, the, battering, ram, s, log, was, slung, from, a, wheeled, frame, by, ropes, or, chains, so, that, it, could, be, made, more, massive, and, be, more, easily, bashed, against, its, target, frequently, the, ram, s, point, would, be, reinforced, with, a, metal, head, or, cap, while, vulnerable, parts, of, the, shaft, were, bound, with, strengthening, metal, bands, vitruvius, details, in, his, text, de, architectura, that, ceras, the, carthaginian, was, the, first, to, make, a, ram, with, a, wooden, base, with, wheels, and, a, wooden, superstructure, with, the, ram, hung, within, this, structure, moved, so, slowly, however, that, he, called, it, the, testudo, latin, for, tortoise, another, type, of, ram, was, one, that, maintained, the, normal, shape, and, structure, but, the, support, beams, were, instead, made, of, saplings, that, were, lashed, together, the, frame, was, then, covered, in, hides, as, normal, to, defend, from, fire, the, only, solid, beam, present, was, the, ram, that, was, hung, from, the, frame, the, frame, itself, was, so, light, that, it, could, be, carried, on, the, shoulders, of, the, men, transporting, the, ram, and, the, same, men, could, beat, the, ram, against, the, wall, when, they, reached, it, many, battering, rams, had, curved, or, slanted, wooden, roofs, and, side, screens, covered, in, protective, materials, usually, fresh, wet, hides, these, canopies, reduced, the, risk, of, the, ram, being, set, on, fire, and, protected, the, operators, of, the, ram, from, arrow, and, spear, volleys, launched, from, above, an, image, of, an, assyrian, battering, ram, depicts, how, sophisticated, attacking, and, defensive, practices, had, become, by, the, 9th, century, bc, the, defenders, of, a, town, wall, are, trying, to, set, the, ram, alight, with, torches, and, have, also, put, a, chain, under, it, the, attackers, are, trying, to, pull, on, the, chain, to, free, the, ram, while, the, aforementioned, wet, hides, on, the, canopy, provide, protection, against, the, flames, by, the, time, the, kushites, made, their, incursions, into, egypt, c, 715, bc, walls, siege, tactics, and, equipment, had, undergone, many, changes, early, shelters, protecting, sappers, armed, with, poles, trying, to, breach, mudbrick, ramparts, gave, way, to, battering, rams, the, first, confirmed, use, of, rams, in, the, occident, happened, from, 503, to, 502, bc, when, opiter, verginius, became, consul, of, the, romans, during, the, fight, against, aurunci, people, the, following, consuls, opiter, virginius, and, sp, cassius, first, endeavored, to, take, pometia, by, storm, and, afterwards, by, raising, battering, rams, vineae, and, other, works, the, second, known, use, was, in, 427, bc, when, the, spartans, besieged, plataea, the, first, use, of, rams, within, the, mediterranean, basin, featuring, in, this, case, the, simultaneous, employment, of, siege, towers, to, shelter, the, rammers, from, attack, occurred, on, the, island, of, sicily, in, 409, bc, at, the, selinus, siege, defenders, manning, castles, forts, or, bastions, would, sometimes, try, to, foil, battering, rams, by, dropping, obstacles, in, front, of, the, ram, such, as, a, large, sack, of, sawdust, just, before, the, ram, s, head, struck, a, wall, or, gate, or, by, using, grappling, hooks, to, immobilize, the, ram, s, log, alternatively, the, ram, could, be, set, ablaze, doused, in, fire, heated, sand, pounded, by, boulders, dropped, from, battlements, or, invested, by, a, rapid, sally, of, troops, some, battering, rams, were, not, slung, from, ropes, or, chains, but, were, instead, supported, by, rollers, this, allowed, the, ram, to, achieve, a, greater, speed, before, striking, its, target, making, it, more, destructive, such, a, ram, as, used, by, alexander, the, great, is, described, by, vitruvius, alternatives, to, the, battering, ram, included, the, drill, the, sapper, s, mouse, the, pick, the, siege, hook, and, the, hunting, ram, these, devices, were, smaller, than, a, ram, and, could, be, used, in, confined, spaces, battering, rams, had, an, important, effect, on, the, evolution, of, defensive, walls, which, were, constructed, ever, more, ingeniously, in, a, bid, to, nullify, the, effects, of, siege, engines, historical, instances, of, the, usage, of, battering, rams, in, sieges, of, major, cities, include, there, is, a, popular, myth, in, gloucester, england, that, the, well, known, children, s, rhyme, humpty, dumpty, is, about, a, battering, ram, used, in, the, siege, of, gloucester, in, 1643, during, the, civil, war, however, the, story, is, almost, certainly, untrue, during, the, siege, which, lasted, only, one, month, no, battering, rams, were, used, although, many, cannons, were, the, idea, seems, to, have, originated, in, a, spoof, history, essay, by, professor, david, daube, written, for, the, oxford, magazine, in, 1956, which, was, widely, believed, despite, obvious, improbabilities, e, g, planning, to, cross, the, river, severn, by, running, the, ram, down, a, hill, at, speed, although, the, river, is, about, 30, m, 100, feet, wide, at, this, point, battering, rams, still, have, a, use, in, modern, times, police, forces, often, employ, small, one, man, or, two, man, metal, rams, known, as, enforcers, for, forcing, open, locked, portals, or, effecting, a, door, breaching, modern, battering, rams, sometimes, incorporate, a, pneumatic, cylinder, and, piston, driven, by, compressed, air, which, are, triggered, by, striking, a, hard, object, and, enhance, the, momentum, of, the, impact, significantly, media, related, to, battering, rams, at, wikimedia, commons
