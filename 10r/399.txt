scissors, are, hand, operated, shearing, tools, a, pair, of, scissors, consists, of, a, pair, of, blades, pivoted, so, that, the, sharpened, edges, slide, against, each, other, when, the, handles, bows, opposite, to, the, pivot, are, closed, scissors, are, used, for, cutting, various, thin, materials, such, as, paper, cardboard, metal, foil, cloth, rope, and, wire, a, large, variety, of, scissors, and, shears, all, exist, for, specialized, purposes, hair, cutting, shears, and, kitchen, shears, are, functionally, equivalent, to, scissors, but, the, larger, implements, tend, to, be, called, shears, hair, cutting, shears, have, specific, blade, angles, ideal, for, cutting, hair, using, the, incorrect, type, of, scissors, to, cut, hair, will, result, in, increased, damage, or, split, ends, or, both, by, breaking, the, hair, kitchen, shears, also, known, as, kitchen, scissors, are, intended, for, cutting, and, trimming, foods, such, as, meats, inexpensive, mass, produced, modern, scissors, are, often, designed, ergonomically, with, composite, thermoplastic, and, rubber, handles, the, noun, scissors, is, treated, as, a, plural, noun, and, therefore, takes, a, plural, verb, e, g, these, scissors, are, alternatively, the, tool, is, referred, to, by, the, singular, phrase, a, pair, of, scissors, the, word, shears, is, used, to, describe, similar, instruments, that, are, larger, in, size, and, for, heavier, cutting, the, earliest, known, scissors, appeared, in, mesopotamia, 3, 000, to, 4, 000, years, ago, these, were, of, the, spring, scissor, type, comprising, two, bronze, blades, connected, at, the, handles, by, a, thin, flexible, strip, of, curved, bronze, which, served, to, hold, the, blades, in, alignment, to, allow, them, to, be, squeezed, together, and, to, pull, them, apart, when, released, spring, scissors, continued, to, be, used, in, europe, until, the, 16th, century, however, pivoted, scissors, of, bronze, or, iron, in, which, the, blades, were, pivoted, at, a, point, between, the, tips, and, the, handles, the, direct, ancestor, of, modern, scissors, were, invented, by, the, romans, around, 100, ad, they, entered, common, use, in, not, only, ancient, rome, but, also, china, japan, and, korea, and, the, idea, is, still, used, in, almost, all, modern, scissors, during, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, spring, scissors, were, made, by, heating, a, bar, of, iron, or, steel, then, flattening, and, shaping, its, ends, into, blades, on, an, anvil, the, center, of, the, bar, was, heated, bent, to, form, the, spring, then, cooled, and, reheated, to, make, it, flexible, the, hangzhou, zhang, xiaoquan, company, in, hangzhou, china, has, been, manufacturing, scissors, since, 1663, william, whiteley, sons, sheffield, ltd, was, producing, scissors, by, 1760, although, it, is, believed, the, business, began, trading, even, earlier, the, first, trade, mark, 332, was, granted, in, 1791, the, company, is, still, manufacturing, scissors, today, and, is, the, oldest, company, in, the, west, to, do, so, pivoted, scissors, were, not, manufactured, in, large, numbers, until, 1761, when, robert, hinchliffe, of, sheffield, produced, the, first, pair, of, modern, day, scissors, made, of, hardened, and, polished, cast, steel, his, major, challenge, was, to, form, the, bows, first, he, made, them, solid, then, drilled, a, hole, and, then, filed, away, metal, to, make, this, large, enough, to, admit, the, user, s, fingers, this, process, was, laborious, and, apparently, hinchliffe, improved, upon, it, in, order, to, increase, production, hinchliffe, lived, in, cheney, square, now, the, site, of, sheffield, town, hall, and, set, up, a, sign, identifying, himself, as, a, fine, scissor, manufacturer, he, achieved, strong, sales, in, london, and, elsewhere, during, the, 19th, century, scissors, were, hand, forged, with, elaborately, decorated, handles, they, were, made, by, hammering, steel, on, indented, surfaces, known, as, bosses, to, form, the, blades, the, rings, in, the, handles, known, as, bows, were, made, by, punching, a, hole, in, the, steel, and, enlarging, it, with, the, pointed, end, of, an, anvil, in, 1649, in, swedish, ruled, finland, an, ironworks, was, founded, in, the, village, of, fiskars, between, helsinki, and, turku, in, 1830, a, new, owner, started, the, first, cutlery, works, in, finland, making, among, other, items, scissors, with, the, fiskars, trademark, the, vast, majority, of, global, scissor, manufacturing, takes, place, in, china, as, of, 2019, china, was, responsible, for, 64, 3, of, worldwide, scissors, exports, when, combined, with, chinese, taipei, exports, this, rises, to, 68, 3, the, primary, scissors, producing, region, in, china, is, in, guandong, province, the, hangzhou, zhang, xiaoquan, company, founded, in, 1663, is, one, of, the, oldest, continuously, operating, scissor, manufacturers, in, the, world, the, company, was, nationalized, in, 1958, and, now, employs, 1500, people, who, annually, mass, produce, an, estimated, seven, million, pairs, of, inexpensive, scissors, that, retail, for, an, average, of, us, 4, each, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, english, word, scissors, came, into, usage, it, was, derived, from, the, old, french, word, cisoires, which, referred, to, shears, there, are, several, historically, important, scissor, producing, regions, in, france, haute, marne, in, nogent, en, bassigny, ch, tellereault, thiers, and, rouen, these, towns, like, many, other, scissor, producing, communities, began, with, sabre, sword, and, bayonet, production, which, transitioned, to, scissors, and, other, blades, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, thiers, in, the, puy, de, d, me, department, of, auvergne, remains, an, important, centre, of, scissor, and, cutlery, production, it, is, home, to, both, the, mus, e, de, la, coutellerie, which, showcases, the, town, s, 800, year, history, of, blade, making, as, well, as, coutellia, an, industry, tradeshow, that, advertises, itself, as, one, of, the, largest, annual, gatherings, of, artisanal, blade, makers, in, the, world, germany, was, responsible, for, manufacturing, just, under, 7, of, global, scissors, exports, in, 2019, often, called, the, city, of, blades, solingen, in, north, rhine, westphalia, has, been, a, center, for, the, manufacturing, of, scissors, since, medieval, times, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, it, s, estimated, that, there, were, over, 300, scissorsmiths, in, solingen, in, 1995, the, city, of, solingen, passed, the, solingen, ordinance, an, update, to, a, 1930s, law, that, decreed, made, in, solingen, stamps, could, only, be, applied, to, products, almost, entirely, manufactured, in, the, old, industrial, area, of, solingen, in, 2019, this, applied, to, approximately, 150, companies, making, high, quality, blades, of, all, kinds, including, scissors, friedrich, herder, founded, in, solingen, in, 1727, is, one, of, the, oldest, scissors, manufacturers, still, operating, in, germany, premana, in, lecco, province, has, its, origins, in, ironworks, and, knife, manufacturing, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, in, 1900, there, were, ten, scissor, manufacturing, workshops, 20, in, 1952, and, 48, by, 1960, today, consorzio, premax, an, industrial, partnership, organizes, over, 60, local, companies, involved, in, the, manufacture, of, scissors, for, global, markets, in, 2019, italy, exported, 3, 5, of, scissors, manufactured, globally, one, of, the, oldest, premanese, scissor, manufacturing, firms, still, in, operation, is, sanelli, ambrogio, which, was, founded, in, 1869, scissormaking, in, japan, evolved, from, sword, making, in, the, 14th, century, seki, in, gifu, prefecture, was, a, renowned, center, of, swordmaking, beginning, in, the, 1200s, after, citizens, were, no, longer, permitted, to, carry, swords, the, city, s, blacksmiths, turned, to, making, scissors, and, knives, there, are, many, specialized, types, of, japanese, scissors, but, sewing, scissors, were, introduced, by, american, commodore, matthew, perry, from, the, united, states, in, 1854, the, sasuke, workshop, in, sakai, city, south, of, osaka, is, run, by, yasuhiro, hirakawa, a, 5th, generation, scissorsmith, the, company, has, been, in, operation, since, 1867, yasuhiro, hirakawa, is, the, last, traditional, scissormaker, in, japan, making, scissors, in, the, traditional, style, where, the, blades, are, believed, to, be, thinner, lighter, and, sharper, than, european, scissors, in, 2018, he, was, profiled, in, a, documentary, that, featured, a, pair, of, his, bonsai, snips, which, retailed, for, us, 35, 000, in, solsona, spain, scissor, manufacturing, began, in, the, 16th, century, at, the, industry, s, peak, in, the, 18th, century, there, were, 24, workshops, organized, as, the, guild, of, saint, eligius, the, patron, saint, of, knife, makers, by, the, mid, 1980s, there, were, only, two, and, by, 2021, pallar, s, solsona, founded, in, 1917, by, llu, s, and, carles, pallar, s, canal, and, still, family, operated, was, the, town, s, sole, remaining, artisanal, scissor, manufacturer, sheffield, was, home, to, the, first, mass, production, of, scissors, beginning, in, 1761, by, the, 19th, century, there, were, an, estimated, 60, steel, scissor, companies, in, sheffield, however, since, the, 1980s, industry, globalization, and, a, shift, towards, cheaper, mass, produced, scissors, created, price, deflation, that, many, artisanal, manufacturers, could, not, compete, with, the, sheffield, scissor, industry, consisted, of, just, two, local, companies, in, 2021, the, two, remaining, sheffield, scissor, manufacturers, are, william, whiteley, founded, in, 1760, and, ernest, wright, which, was, established, in, 1902, both, now, focus, on, high, end, niche, crafting, of, products, for, life, rather, than, mass, production, between, these, two, firms, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, no, more, than, ten, putter, togetherers, or, putters, who, are, the, master, trained, craftspeople, responsible, for, high, quality, sheffield, scissor, assembly, in, 2020, ernest, wright, was, recognized, with, the, award, for, endangered, crafts, by, the, british, heritage, crafts, association, a, pair, of, scissors, consists, of, two, pivoted, blades, in, lower, quality, scissors, the, cutting, edges, are, not, particularly, sharp, it, is, primarily, the, shearing, action, between, the, two, blades, that, cuts, the, material, in, high, quality, scissors, the, blades, can, be, both, extremely, sharp, and, tension, sprung, to, increase, the, cutting, and, shearing, tension, only, at, the, exact, point, where, the, blades, meet, the, hand, movement, pushing, with, the, thumb, pulling, with, the, fingers, can, add, to, this, tension, an, ideal, example, is, in, high, quality, tailor, s, scissors, or, shears, which, need, to, be, able, to, perfectly, cut, and, not, simply, tear, apart, delicate, cloths, such, as, chiffon, and, silk, children, s, scissors, are, usually, not, particularly, sharp, and, the, tips, of, the, blades, are, often, blunted, or, rounded, for, safety, mechanically, scissors, are, a, first, class, double, lever, with, the, pivot, acting, as, the, fulcrum, for, cutting, thick, or, heavy, material, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, lever, can, be, exploited, by, placing, the, material, to, be, cut, as, close, to, the, fulcrum, as, possible, for, example, if, the, applied, force, at, the, handles, is, twice, as, far, away, from, the, fulcrum, as, the, cutting, location, i, e, the, point, of, contact, between, the, blades, the, force, at, the, cutting, location, is, twice, that, of, the, applied, force, at, the, handles, scissors, cut, material, by, applying, at, the, cutting, location, a, local, shear, stress, which, exceeds, the, material, s, shear, strength, some, scissors, have, an, appendage, called, a, finger, brace, or, finger, tang, below, the, index, finger, hole, for, the, middle, finger, to, rest, on, to, provide, for, better, control, and, more, power, in, precision, cutting, a, finger, tang, can, be, found, on, many, quality, scissors, including, inexpensive, ones, and, especially, on, scissors, for, cutting, hair, see, hair, scissors, pictured, below, in, hair, cutting, some, claim, the, ring, finger, is, inserted, where, some, place, their, index, finger, and, the, little, finger, rests, on, the, finger, tang, for, people, who, do, not, have, the, use, of, their, hands, there, are, specially, designed, foot, operated, scissors, some, quadriplegics, can, use, a, motorized, mouth, operated, style, of, scissor, most, scissors, are, best, suited, for, use, with, the, right, hand, but, left, handed, scissors, are, designed, for, use, with, the, left, hand, because, scissors, have, overlapping, blades, they, are, not, symmetric, this, asymmetry, is, true, regardless, of, the, orientation, and, shape, of, the, handles, and, blades, the, blade, that, is, on, top, always, forms, the, same, diagonal, regardless, of, orientation, human, hands, are, asymmetric, and, when, closing, the, scissors, the, thumb, and, fingers, do, not, close, vertically, but, have, a, lateral, component, to, the, motion, specifically, the, thumb, pushes, out, from, the, palm, and, the, fingers, pull, inwards, for, right, handed, scissors, held, in, the, right, hand, the, thumb, blade, is, closer, to, the, user, s, body, so, that, the, natural, tendency, of, the, right, hand, is, to, push, the, cutting, blades, together, conversely, if, right, handed, scissors, are, held, in, the, left, hand, the, natural, tendency, of, the, left, hand, would, be, to, push, the, cutting, blades, apart, furthermore, with, right, handed, scissors, held, by, the, right, hand, the, shearing, edge, is, visible, but, when, they, are, used, with, the, left, hand, the, cutting, edge, of, the, scissors, is, behind, the, top, blade, and, the, cutter, cannot, see, what, is, being, cut, there, are, two, varieties, of, left, handed, scissors, many, common, left, handed, scissors, often, called, semi, left, handed, scissors, simply, have, reversed, finger, grips, the, blades, open, and, close, as, with, right, handed, scissors, so, that, users, tend, to, pull, the, blades, apart, as, they, are, cutting, this, can, be, challenging, for, craftspeople, as, the, blades, still, obscure, the, cut, true, left, handed, scissors, have, both, reversed, finger, grips, and, reversed, blade, layout, like, mirror, images, of, right, handed, scissors, a, left, handed, person, accustomed, to, using, semi, left, handed, scissors, may, find, using, true, left, handed, scissors, difficult, at, first, as, they, may, have, learned, to, rely, heavily, on, the, strength, of, their, thumb, to, pull, the, blades, apart, vs, pushing, the, blades, together, in, order, to, cut, some, scissors, are, marketed, as, ambidextrous, these, have, symmetric, handles, so, there, is, no, distinction, between, the, thumb, and, finger, handles, and, have, very, strong, pivots, so, that, the, blades, rotate, without, any, lateral, give, however, most, ambidextrous, scissors, are, in, fact, still, right, handed, in, that, the, upper, blade, is, on, the, right, and, hence, is, on, the, outside, when, held, in, the, right, hand, even, if, they, cut, successfully, the, blade, orientation, will, block, the, view, of, the, cutting, line, for, a, left, handed, person, true, ambidextrous, scissors, are, possible, if, the, blades, are, double, edged, and, one, handle, is, swung, all, the, way, around, to, almost, 360, degrees, so, that, what, were, the, backs, of, the, blades, become, the, new, cutting, edges, u, s, patent, 3, 978, 584, was, awarded, for, true, ambidextrous, scissors, specialized, scissors, and, shears, include, due, to, their, ubiquity, across, cultures, and, classes, scissors, have, numerous, representations, across, world, culture, numerous, art, forms, worldwide, enlist, scissors, as, a, tool, material, with, which, to, accomplish, the, art, for, cases, where, scissors, appear, in, or, are, represented, by, the, final, art, product, see, commons, category, scissors, in, art, heinrich, hoffmann, s, 1845, children, s,

about, the, great, tall, scissorman, augusten, burroughs, 2002, memoir, running, with, scissors, spent, eight, weeks, on, the, new, york, times, best, seller, list, the, book, was, later, adapted, into, a, film, the, term, scissor, kick, may, be, found, in, several, sports, including, scissors, have, a, widespread, place, in, cultural, superstitions, in, many, cases, the, details, of, the, superstition, may, be, specific, to, a, given, country, region, tribe, religion, or, even, situation, scissors, have, been, used, in, the, sciences, for, various, purposes, including, descriptions, of, animals, or, natural, features, animals, named, after, scissors, include
