a, grenade, is, an, explosive, weapon, typically, thrown, by, hand, also, called, hand, grenade, but, can, also, refer, to, a, shell, explosive, projectile, shot, from, the, muzzle, of, a, rifle, as, a, rifle, grenade, or, a, grenade, launcher, a, modern, hand, grenade, generally, consists, of, an, explosive, charge, filler, a, detonator, mechanism, an, internal, striker, to, trigger, the, detonator, an, arming, safety, secured, by, a, transport, safety, the, user, removes, the, transport, safety, before, throwing, and, once, the, grenade, leaves, the, hand, the, arming, safety, gets, released, allowing, the, striker, to, trigger, a, primer, that, ignites, a, fuze, sometimes, called, the, delay, element, which, burns, down, to, the, detonator, and, explodes, the, main, charge, grenades, work, by, dispersing, fragments, fragmentation, grenades, shockwaves, high, explosive, anti, tank, and, stun, grenades, chemical, aerosols, smoke, gas, and, chemical, grenades, or, fire, incendiary, grenades, their, outer, casings, generally, made, of, a, hard, synthetic, material, or, steel, are, designed, to, rupture, and, fragment, on, detonation, sending, out, numerous, fragments, shards, and, splinters, as, fast, flying, projectiles, in, modern, grenades, a, pre, formed, fragmentation, matrix, inside, the, grenade, is, commonly, used, which, may, be, spherical, cuboid, wire, or, notched, wire, most, anti, personnel, ap, grenades, are, designed, to, detonate, either, after, a, time, delay, or, on, impact, grenades, are, often, spherical, cylindrical, ovoid, or, truncated, ovoid, in, shape, and, of, a, size, that, fits, the, hand, of, an, average, sized, adult, some, grenades, are, mounted, at, the, end, of, a, handle, and, known, as, stick, grenades, the, stick, design, provides, leverage, for, throwing, longer, distances, but, at, the, cost, of, additional, weight, and, length, and, has, been, considered, obsolete, by, western, countries, since, the, second, world, war, and, cold, war, periods, a, friction, igniter, inside, the, handle, or, on, the, top, of, the, grenade, head, was, used, to, initiate, the, fuse, the, word, grenade, is, likely, derived, from, the, french, word, spelled, exactly, the, same, meaning, pomegranate, as, the, bomb, is, reminiscent, of, the, many, seeded, fruit, in, size, and, shape, its, first, use, in, english, dates, from, the, 1590s, rudimentary, incendiary, grenades, appeared, in, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, not, long, after, the, reign, of, leo, iii, 717, 741, byzantine, soldiers, learned, that, greek, fire, a, byzantine, invention, of, the, previous, century, could, not, only, be, thrown, by, flamethrowers, at, the, enemy, but, also, in, stone, and, ceramic, jars, later, glass, containers, were, employed, in, song, china, 960, 1279, weapons, known, as, thunder, crash, bombs, were, created, when, soldiers, packed, gunpowder, into, ceramic, or, metal, containers, fitted, with, fuses, a, 1044, military, book, wujing, zongyao, compilation, of, military, classics, described, various, gunpowder, recipes, in, which, one, can, find, according, to, joseph, needham, the, prototype, of, the, modern, hand, grenade, the, shells, p, o, are, made, of, cast, iron, as, large, as, a, bowl, and, shaped, like, a, ball, inside, they, contain, half, a, pound, of, divine, fire, sh, n, hu, gunpowder, they, are, sent, flying, towards, the, enemy, camp, from, an, eruptor, mu, p, o, and, when, they, get, there, a, sound, like, a, thunder, clap, is, heard, and, flashes, of, light, appear, if, ten, of, these, shells, are, fired, successfully, into, the, enemy, camp, the, whole, place, will, be, set, ablaze, grenade, like, devices, were, also, known, in, ancient, india, in, a, 12th, century, persian, historiography, the, mojmal, al, tawarikh, a, terracotta, elephant, filled, with, explosives, set, with, a, fuse, was, placed, hidden, in, the, van, and, exploded, as, the, invading, army, approached, the, first, cast, iron, bombshells, and, grenades, appeared, in, europe, in, 1467, where, their, initial, role, was, with, the, besieging, and, defense, of, castles, and, fortifications, a, hoard, of, several, hundred, ceramic, hand, grenades, was, discovered, during, construction, in, front, of, a, bastion, of, the, bavarian, city, of, ingolstadt, germany, dated, to, the, 17th, century, many, of, the, grenades, retained, their, original, black, powder, loads, and, igniters, the, grenades, were, most, likely, intentionally, dumped, in, the, moat, of, the, bastion, prior, to, 1723, by, the, mid, 17th, century, infantry, known, as, grenadiers, began, to, emerge, in, the, armies, of, europe, who, specialized, in, shock, and, close, quarters, combat, mostly, with, the, usage, of, grenades, and, fierce, melee, combat, in, 1643, it, is, possible, that, grenados, were, thrown, amongst, the, welsh, at, holt, bridge, during, the, english, civil, war, the, word, grenade, was, also, used, during, the, events, surrounding, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1688, where, cricket, ball, sized, 8, 81, to, 9, in, 224, to, 229, mm, in, circumference, iron, spheres, packed, with, gunpowder, and, fitted, with, slow, burning, wicks, were, first, used, against, the, jacobites, in, the, battles, of, killiecrankie, and, glen, shiel, these, grenades, were, not, very, effective, owing, both, to, the, unreliability, of, their, fuse, as, well, inconsistent, times, to, detonation, and, as, a, result, saw, little, use, grenades, were, also, used, during, the, golden, age, of, piracy, especially, during, boarding, actions, pirate, captain, thompson, used, vast, numbers, of, powder, flasks, grenade, shells, and, stinkpots, to, defeat, two, pirate, hunters, sent, by, the, governor, of, jamaica, in, 1721, improvised, grenades, were, increasingly, used, from, the, mid, 19th, century, the, confines, of, trenches, enhancing, the, effect, of, small, explosive, devices, in, a, letter, to, his, sister, colonel, hugh, robert, hibbert, described, an, improvised, grenade, that, was, employed, by, british, troops, during, the, crimean, war, 1854, 1856, we, have, a, new, invention, to, annoy, our, friends, in, their, pits, it, consists, in, filling, empty, soda, water, bottles, full, of, powder, old, twisted, nails, and, any, other, sharp, or, cutting, thing, we, can, find, at, the, time, sticking, a, bit, of, tow, in, for, a, fuse, then, lighting, it, and, throwing, it, quickly, into, our, neighbors, pit, where, it, bursts, to, their, great, annoyance, you, may, imagine, their, rage, at, seeing, a, soda, water, bottle, come, tumbling, into, a, hole, full, of, men, with, a, little, fuse, burning, away, as, proud, as, a, real, shell, exploding, and, burying, itself, into, soft, parts, of, the, flesh, in, march, 1868, during, the, paraguayan, war, the, paraguayan, troops, used, hand, grenades, in, their, attempt, to, board, brazilian, ironclad, warships, with, canoes, hand, grenades, were, used, on, naval, engagements, during, the, war, of, the, pacific, during, the, siege, of, mafeking, in, the, second, boer, war, the, defenders, used, fishing, rods, and, a, mechanical, spring, device, to, throw, improvised, grenades, improvised, hand, grenades, were, used, to, great, effect, by, the, russian, defenders, of, port, arthur, now, l, shun, port, during, the, russo, japanese, war, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, ineffectiveness, of, the, available, types, of, hand, grenades, coupled, with, their, levels, of, danger, to, the, user, and, difficulty, of, operation, meant, that, they, were, regarded, as, increasingly, obsolete, pieces, of, military, equipment, in, 1902, the, british, war, office, announced, that, hand, grenades, were, obsolete, and, had, no, place, in, modern, warfare, but, within, two, years, following, the, success, of, improvised, grenades, in, the, trench, warfare, conditions, of, the, russo, japanese, war, and, reports, from, general, sir, aylmer, haldane, a, british, observer, of, the, conflict, a, reassessment, was, quickly, made, and, the, board, of, ordnance, was, instructed, to, develop, a, practical, hand, grenade, various, models, using, a, percussion, fuze, were, built, but, this, type, of, fuze, suffered, from, various, practical, problems, and, they, were, not, commissioned, in, large, numbers, marten, hale, known, for, patenting, the, hales, rifle, grenade, developed, a, modern, hand, grenade, in, 1906, but, was, unsuccessful, in, persuading, the, british, army, to, adopt, the, weapon, until, 1913, hale, s, chief, competitor, was, nils, waltersen, aasen, who, invented, his, design, in, 1906, in, norway, receiving, a, patent, for, it, in, england, aasen, began, his, experiments, with, developing, a, grenade, while, serving, as, a, sergeant, in, the, oscarsborg, fortress, aasen, formed, the, aasenske, granatkompani, in, denmark, which, before, the, first, world, war, produced, and, exported, hand, grenades, in, large, numbers, across, europe, he, had, success, in, marketing, his, weapon, to, the, french, and, was, appointed, as, a, knight, of, the, french, legion, of, honour, in, 1916, for, the, invention, the, royal, laboratory, developed, the, no, 1, grenade, in, 1908, it, contained, explosive, material, with, an, iron, fragmentation, band, with, an, impact, fuze, detonating, when, the, top, of, the, grenade, hit, the, ground, a, long, cane, handle, approximately, 16, inches, or, 40, cm, allowed, the, user, to, throw, the, grenade, farther, than, the, blast, of, the, explosion, it, suffered, from, the, handicap, that, the, percussion, fuse, was, armed, before, throwing, which, meant, that, if, the, user, was, in, a, trench, or, other, confined, space, he, was, apt, to, detonate, it, and, kill, himself, when, he, drew, back, his, arm, to, throw, it, early, in, world, war, i, combatant, nations, only, had, small, grenades, similar, to, hales, and, aasen, s, design, the, italian, besozzi, grenade, had, a, five, second, fuze, with, a, match, tip, that, was, ignited, by, striking, on, a, ring, on, the, soldier, s, hand, william, mills, a, hand, grenade, designer, from, sunderland, patented, developed, and, manufactured, the, mills, bomb, at, the, mills, munition, factory, in, birmingham, england, in, 1915, designating, it, the, no, 5, it, was, described, as, the, first, safe, grenade, they, were, explosive, filled, steel, canisters, with, a, triggering, pin, and, a, distinctive, deeply, notched, surface, this, segmentation, is, often, erroneously, thought, to, aid, fragmentation, though, mills, own, notes, show, the, external, grooves, were, purely, to, aid, the, soldier, to, grip, the, weapon, improved, fragmentation, designs, were, later, made, with, the, notches, on, the, inside, but, at, that, time, they, would, have, been, too, expensive, to, produce, the, external, segmentation, of, the, original, mills, bomb, was, retained, as, it, provided, a, positive, grip, surface, this, basic, pin, and, pineapple, design, is, still, used, in, some, modern, grenades, after, the, second, world, war, the, general, design, of, hand, grenades, has, been, fundamentally, unchanged, with, pin, and, lever, being, the, predominant, igniter, system, with, the, major, powers, though, incremental, and, evolutionary, improvements, continuously, were, made, in, 2012, spr, nghandgranat, 07, shgr, 07, blast, hand, grenade, 07, was, announced, as, the, first, major, innovation, in, the, area, of, handgrenades, since, the, great, war, developed, by, ian, kinley, at, f, rsvarets, materielverk, fmv, shgr, 07, is, a, self, righting, jumping, hand, grenade, containing, some, 1900, balls, that, covers, a, cone, 10, metres, in, diameter, with, the, centre, about, 2, metres, in, height, this, minimize, the, dangers, outside, the, lethal, zone, as, there, is, little, to, no, random, scattering, of, fragments, from, the, blast, fragmentation, grenades, are, common, in, armies, they, are, weapons, that, are, designed, to, disperse, fragments, on, detonation, aimed, to, damage, targets, within, the, lethal, and, injury, radii, the, body, is, generally, made, of, a, hard, synthetic, material, or, steel, which, will, provide, some, fragmentation, as, shards, and, splinters, though, in, modern, grenades, a, pre, formed, fragmentation, matrix, is, often, used, the, pre, formed, fragmentation, may, be, spherical, cuboid, wire, or, notched, wire, most, explosive, grenades, are, designed, to, detonate, either, after, a, time, delay, or, on, impact, modern, fragmentation, grenades, such, as, the, united, states, m67, grenade, have, a, wounding, radius, of, 15, m, 49, ft, half, that, of, older, style, grenades, which, can, still, be, encountered, and, can, be, thrown, about, 40, m, 130, ft, fragments, may, travel, more, than, 200, m, 660, ft, these, grenades, are, usually, classed, as, offensive, weapons, because, the, effective, casualty, radius, is, much, less, than, the, distance, it, can, be, thrown, and, its, explosive, power, works, better, within, more, confined, spaces, such, as, fortifications, or, buildings, where, entrenched, defenders, often, occupy, the, concussion, effect, rather, than, any, expelled, fragments, is, the, effective, killer, in, the, case, of, the, us, mk3a2, the, casualty, radius, is, published, as, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, open, areas, but, fragments, and, bits, of, fuze, may, be, projected, as, far, as, 200, m, 660, ft, from, the, detonation, point, concussion, grenades, have, also, been, used, as, depth, charges, underwater, explosives, around, boats, and, underwater, targets, some, like, the, us, mk, 40, concussion, grenade, are, designed, for, use, against, enemy, divers, and, frogmen, underwater, explosions, kill, or, otherwise, incapacitate, the, target, by, creating, a, lethal, shock, wave, underwater, the, us, army, armament, research, development, and, engineering, center, ardec, announced, in, 2016, that, they, were, developing, a, grenade, which, could, operate, in, either, fragmentation, or, blast, mode, selected, at, any, time, before, throwing, the, electronically, fuzed, enhanced, tactical, multi, purpose, et, mp, hand, grenade, during, the, great, war, handgrenades, were, frequently, used, by, troops, lacking, other, means, to, defend, against, enemy, tanks, threatening, to, over, run, the, position, to, various, success, the, interwar, period, saw, some, limited, development, of, grenades, specifically, intended, to, defeat, armour, but, it, was, not, until, the, outbreak, of, wwii, serious, efforts, were, made, while, there, were, infantry, anti, tank, weapons, available, they, were, either, not, ubiquitous, enough, ineffective, or, both, anti, tank, grenades, were, a, suitable, stopgap, to, ensure, a, rudimentary, capability, for, every, squad, to, be, used, for, self, defence, once, rocket, propelled, shaped, charges, became, available, in, greater, numbers, anti, tank, hand, grenades, became, almost, obsolete, however, they, were, still, used, with, limited, success, in, the, iraqi, insurgency, in, the, early, 2000s, against, lightly, armoured, mine, resistant, ambush, protected, mrap, vehicles, designed, for, protection, only, against, improvised, explosive, devices, as, well, as, drone, ordnance, in, ukraine, 2022, 2024, during, world, war, ii, the, united, kingdom, used, incendiary, grenades, based, on, white, phosphorus, one, model, the, no, 76, special, incendiary, grenade, was, mainly, issued, to, the, home, guard, as, an, anti, tank, weapon, it, was, produced, in, vast, numbers, by, august, 1941, well, over, 6, 000, 000, had, been, manufactured, sting, grenades, also, known, as, stingball, or, sting, ball, grenades, are, stun, grenades, based, on, the, design, of, the, fragmentation, grenade, instead, of, using, a, metal, casing, to, produce, fragmentation, they, are, made, from, hard, rubber, and, are, filled, with, around, 100, rubber, or, plastic, balls, on, detonation, these, balls, and, fragments, from, the, rubber, casing, explode, outward, in, all, directions, as, reduced, lethality, projectiles, which, may, ricochet, it, is, intended, that, people, struck, by, the, projectiles, will, receive, a, series, of, fast, painful, stings, without, serious, injury, some, types, have, an, additional, payload, of, cs, gas, sting, grenades, do, not, reliably, incapacitate, people, so, they, can, be, dangerous, to, use, against, armed, subjects, they, sometimes, cause, serious, physical, injury, especially, the, rubber, fragments, from, the, casing, 88, people, have, lost, eyes, and, hands, to, sting, grenades, sting, grenades, are, sometimes, called, stinger, grenades, which, is, a, genericized, trademark, as, stinger, is, trademarked, by, defense, technology, for, its, line, of, sting, grenades, 83, 84, chemical, and, gas, grenades, burn, or, release, a, gas, and, do, not, explode, practice, or, simulation, grenades, are, similar, in, handling, and, function, to, other, hand, grenades, except, that, they, only, produce, a, loud, popping, noise, and, a, puff, of, smoke, on, detonation, the, grenade, body, can, be, reused, another, type, is, the, throwing, practice, grenade, which, is, completely, inert, and, often, cast, in, one, piece, it, is, used, to, give, soldiers, a, feel, for, the, weight, and, shape, of, real, grenades, and, for, practicing, precision, throwing, examples, of, practice, grenades, include, the, k417, biodegradable, practice, hand, grenade, by, cnotech, korea, when, using, a, hand, grenade, the, objective, is, to, have, the, grenade, explode, so, that, the, target, is, within, its, effective, radius, while, keeping, the, thrower, out, of, the, same, for, this, reason, several, systems, has, been, used, to, trigger, the, explosion, impact, was, the, first, used, with, fragile, containers, of, greek, fire, that, ruptured, when, landing, later, impact, fuzes, contained, some, kind, of, sensitive, explosive, to, either, initiate, the, main, charge, directly, or, set, off, a, primer, charge, that, in, turn, detonates, the, main, charge, this, turned, out, to, present, significant, drawbacks, either, the, primer, is, so, sensitive, that, unintended, and, premature, ignition, happens, while, a, more, stable, substance, often, fails, to, set, off, the, grenade, when, landing, in, softer, ground, not, seldom, even, allowing, the, targeted, troops, to, hurl, the, grenade, back, thus, the, only, significant, use, of, impact, fuzes, since, wwi, has, been, in, anti, tank, grenades, fuze, delayed, grenades, is, the, predominant, system, today, developed, from, the, match, fuzes, that, were, hand, lit, in, the, early, grenades, from, there, two, sub, groups, were, developed, friction, ignitors, where, a, cord, is, pulled, or, a, cap, is, twisted, to, ignite, the, delay, fuze, like, on, the, german, stielhandgranate, the, other, being, strike, or, percussion, ignitors, where, the, user, either, hit, the, cap, before, the, throw, like, on, the, japanese, type, 10, grenade, or, have, a, spring, loaded, striker, hit, the, cap, after, the, grenade, is, released, like, the, mills, bomb, with, the, latter, being, predominant, since, wwii, there, is, also, an, alternative, technique, of, throwing, where, the, grenade, is, not, thrown, immediately, after, the, fuze, is, ignited, which, allows, the, fuze, to, burn, partially, and, decrease, the, time, to, detonation, after, throwing, this, is, referred, to, as, cooking, a, shorter, delay, is, useful, to, reduce, the, ability, of, the, enemy, to, take, cover, throw, or, kick, the, grenade, away, and, can, also, be, used, to, allow, a, fragmentation, grenade, to, explode, into, the, air, over, defensive, positions, concerned, with, a, number, of, serious, incidents, and, accidents, involving, hand, grenades, ian, kinley, at, the, swedish, f, rsvarets, materielverk, identified, the, two, main, issues, as, the, time, fuze, s, burntime, variation, with, temperature, slows, down, in, cold, and, speeds, up, in, heat, and, the, springs, the, striker, spring, in, particular, coming, pre, tensioned, from, the, factory, by, mechanism, designs, that, had, not, changed, much, since, the, 1930s, in, 2019, a, new, mechanism, fully, interchangeable, with, the, old, ones, was, adopted, into, service, the, main, difference, apart, from, a, fully, environmentally, stable, delay, is, that, the, springs, now, are, twist, tensioned, by, the, thrower, after, the, transport, safety, pin, and, ring, has, been, removed, thus, eliminating, the, possibility, of, unintentional, arming, of, the, hand, grenade, modern, manufacturers, of, hand, grenades, include
