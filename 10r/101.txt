hypertext, markup, language, html, is, the, standard, markup, language, for, documents, designed, to, be, displayed, in, a, web, browser, it, defines, the, content, and, structure, of, web, content, it, is, often, assisted, by, technologies, such, as, cascading, style, sheets, css, and, scripting, languages, such, as, javascript, web, browsers, receive, html, documents, from, a, web, server, or, from, local, storage, and, render, the, documents, into, multimedia, web, pages, html, describes, the, structure, of, a, web, page, semantically, and, originally, included, cues, for, its, appearance, html, elements, are, the, building, blocks, of, html, pages, with, html, constructs, images, and, other, objects, such, as, interactive, forms, may, be, embedded, into, the, rendered, page, html, provides, a, means, to, create, structured, documents, by, denoting, structural, semantics, for, text, such, as, headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and, other, items, html, elements, are, delineated, by, tags, written, using, angle, brackets, tags, such, as, img, and, input, directly, introduce, content, into, the, page, other, tags, such, as, p, and, p, surround, and, provide, information, about, document, text, and, may, include, sub, element, tags, browsers, do, not, display, the, html, tags, but, use, them, to, interpret, the, content, of, the, page, html, can, embed, programs, written, in, a, scripting, language, such, as, javascript, which, affects, the, behavior, and, content, of, web, pages, the, inclusion, of, css, defines, the, look, and, layout, of, content, the, world, wide, web, consortium, w3c, former, maintainer, of, the, html, and, current, maintainer, of, the, css, standards, has, encouraged, the, use, of, css, over, explicit, presentational, html, since, 1997, a, form, of, html, known, as, html5, is, used, to, display, video, and, audio, primarily, using, the, canvas, element, together, with, javascript, in, 1980, physicist, tim, berners, lee, a, contractor, at, cern, proposed, and, prototyped, enquire, a, system, for, cern, researchers, to, use, and, share, documents, in, 1989, berners, lee, wrote, a, memo, proposing, an, internet, based, hypertext, system, berners, lee, specified, html, and, wrote, the, browser, and, server, software, in, late, 1990, that, year, berners, lee, and, cern, data, systems, engineer, robert, cailliau, collaborated, on, a, joint, request, for, funding, but, the, project, was, not, formally, adopted, by, cern, in, his, personal, notes, of, 1990, berners, lee, listed, some, of, the, many, areas, in, which, hypertext, is, used, an, encyclopedia, is, the, first, entry, the, first, publicly, available, description, of, html, was, a, document, called, html, tags, first, mentioned, on, the, internet, by, tim, berners, lee, in, late, 1991, it, describes, 18, elements, comprising, the, initial, relatively, simple, design, of, html, except, for, the, hyperlink, tag, these, were, strongly, influenced, by, sgmlguid, an, in, house, standard, generalized, markup, language, sgml, based, documentation, format, at, cern, eleven, of, these, elements, still, exist, in, html, 4, html, is, a, markup, language, that, web, browsers, use, to, interpret, and, compose, text, images, and, other, material, into, visible, or, audible, web, pages, default, characteristics, for, every, item, of, html, markup, are, defined, in, the, browser, and, these, characteristics, can, be, altered, or, enhanced, by, the, web, page, designer, s, additional, use, of, css, many, of, the, text, elements, are, mentioned, in, the, 1988, iso, technical, report, tr, 9537, techniques, for, using, sgml, which, describes, the, features, of, early, text, formatting, languages, such, as, that, used, by, the, runoff, command, developed, in, the, early, 1960s, for, the, ctss, compatible, time, sharing, system, operating, system, these, formatting, commands, were, derived, from, the, commands, used, by, typesetters, to, manually, format, documents, however, the, sgml, concept, of, generalized, markup, is, based, on, elements, nested, annotated, ranges, with, attributes, rather, than, merely, print, effects, with, separate, structure, and, markup, html, has, been, progressively, moved, in, this, direction, with, css, berners, lee, considered, html, to, be, an, application, of, sgml, it, was, formally, defined, as, such, by, the, internet, engineering, task, force, ietf, with, the, mid, 1993, publication, of, the, first, proposal, for, an, html, specification, the, hypertext, markup, language, html, internet, draft, by, berners, lee, and, dan, connolly, which, included, an, sgml, document, type, definition, to, define, the, syntax, the, draft, expired, after, six, months, but, was, notable, for, its, acknowledgment, of, the, ncsa, mosaic, browser, s, custom, tag, for, embedding, in, line, images, reflecting, the, ietf, s, philosophy, of, basing, standards, on, successful, prototypes, similarly, dave, raggett, s, competing, internet, draft, html, hypertext, markup, format, from, late, 1993, suggested, standardizing, already, implemented, features, like, tables, and, fill, out, forms, after, the, html, and, html, drafts, expired, in, early, 1994, the, ietf, created, an, html, working, group, in, 1995, this, working, group, completed, html, 2, 0, the, first, html, specification, intended, to, be, treated, as, a, standard, against, which, future, implementations, should, be, based, further, development, under, the, auspices, of, the, ietf, was, stalled, by, competing, interests, since, 1996, the, html, specifications, have, been, maintained, with, input, from, commercial, software, vendors, by, the, world, wide, web, consortium, w3c, in, 2000, html, became, an, international, standard, iso, iec, 15445, 2000, html, 4, 01, was, published, in, late, 1999, with, further, errata, published, through, 2001, in, 2004, development, began, on, html5, in, the, web, hypertext, application, technology, working, group, whatwg, which, became, a, joint, deliverable, with, the, w3c, in, 2008, and, was, completed, and, standardized, on, 28, october, 2014, xhtml, is, a, separate, language, that, began, as, a, reformulation, of, html, 4, 01, using, xml, 1, 0, it, is, now, referred, to, as, the, xml, syntax, for, html, and, is, no, longer, being, developed, as, a, separate, standard, on, 28, may, 2019, the, w3c, announced, that, whatwg, would, be, the, sole, publisher, of, the, html, and, dom, standards, the, w3c, and, whatwg, had, been, publishing, competing, standards, since, 2012, while, the, w3c, standard, was, identical, to, the, whatwg, in, 2007, the, standards, have, since, progressively, diverged, due, to, different, design, decisions, the, whatwg, living, standard, had, been, the, de, facto, web, standard, for, some, time, html, markup, consists, of, several, key, components, including, those, called, tags, and, their, attributes, character, based, data, types, character, references, and, entity, references, html, tags, most, commonly, come, in, pairs, like, h1, and, h1, although, some, represent, empty, elements, and, so, are, unpaired, for, example, img, the, first, tag, in, such, a, pair, is, the, start, tag, and, the, second, is, the, end, tag, they, are, also, called, opening, tags, and, closing, tags, another, important, component, is, the, html, document, type, declaration, which, triggers, standards, mode, rendering, the, following, is, an, example, of, the, classic, hello, world, program, the, text, between, html, and, html, describes, the, web, page, and, the, text, between, body, and, body, is, the, visible, page, content, the, markup, text, title, this, is, a, title, title, defines, the, browser, page, title, shown, on, browser, tabs, and, window, titles, and, the, tag, div, defines, a, division, of, the, page, used, for, easy, styling, between, head, and, head, a, meta, element, can, be, used, to, define, webpage, metadata, the, document, type, declaration, doctype, html, is, for, html5, if, a, declaration, is, not, included, various, browsers, will, revert, to, quirks, mode, for, rendering, html, documents, imply, a, structure, of, nested, html, elements, these, are, indicated, in, the, document, by, html, tags, enclosed, in, angle, brackets, thus, p, in, the, simple, general, case, the, extent, of, an, element, is, indicated, by, a, pair, of, tags, a, start, tag, p, and, end, tag, p, the, text, content, of, the, element, if, any, is, placed, between, these, tags, tags, may, also, enclose, further, tag, markup, between, the, start, and, end, including, a, mixture, of, tags, and, text, this, indicates, further, nested, elements, as, children, of, the, parent, element, the, start, tag, may, also, include, the, element, s, attributes, within, the, tag, these, indicate, other, information, such, as, identifiers, for, sections, within, the, document, identifiers, used, to, bind, style, information, to, the, presentation, of, the, document, and, for, some, tags, such, as, the, img, used, to, embed, images, the, reference, to, the, image, resource, in, the, format, like, this, img, src, example, com, example, jpg, some, elements, such, as, the, line, break, br, do, not, permit, any, embedded, content, either, text, or, further, tags, these, require, only, a, single, empty, tag, akin, to, a, start, tag, and, do, not, use, an, end, tag, many, tags, particularly, the, closing, end, tag, for, the, very, commonly, used, paragraph, element, p, are, optional, an, html, browser, or, other, agent, can, infer, the, closure, for, the, end, of, an, element, from, the, context, and, the, structural, rules, defined, by, the, html, standard, these, rules, are, complex, and, not, widely, understood, by, most, html, authors, the, general, form, of, an, html, element, is, therefore, tag, attribute1, value1, attribute2, value2, content, tag, some, html, elements, are, defined, as, empty, elements, and, take, the, form, tag, attribute1, value1, attribute2, value2, empty, elements, may, enclose, no, content, for, instance, the, br, tag, or, the, inline, img, tag, the, name, of, an, html, element, is, the, name, used, in, the, tags, the, end, tag, s, name, is, preceded, by, a, slash, character, and, that, in, empty, elements, the, end, tag, is, neither, required, nor, allowed, if, attributes, are, not, mentioned, default, values, are, used, in, each, case, header, of, the, html, document, head, head, the, title, is, included, in, the, head, for, example, html, headings, are, defined, with, the, h1, to, h6, tags, with, h1, being, the, highest, or, most, important, level, and, h6, the, least, the, effects, are, css, can, substantially, change, the, rendering, paragraphs, br, the, difference, between, br, and, p, is, that, br, breaks, a, line, without, altering, the, semantic, structure, of, the, page, whereas, p, sections, the, page, into, paragraphs, the, element, br, is, an, empty, element, in, that, although, it, may, have, attributes, it, can, take, no, content, and, it, may, not, have, an, end, tag, this, is, a, link, in, html, to, create, a, link, the, a, tag, is, used, the, href, attribute, holds, the, url, address, of, the, link, there, are, many, possible, ways, a, user, can, give, input, s, like, comments, comments, can, help, in, the, understanding, of, the, markup, and, do, not, display, in, the, webpage, there, are, several, types, of, markup, elements, used, in, html, most, of, the, attributes, of, an, element, are, name, value, pairs, separated, by, and, written, within, the, start, tag, of, an, element, after, the, element, s, name, the, value, may, be, enclosed, in, single, or, double, quotes, although, values, consisting, of, certain, characters, can, be, left, unquoted, in, html, but, not, xhtml, leaving, attribute, values, unquoted, is, considered, unsafe, in, contrast, with, name, value, pair, attributes, there, are, some, attributes, that, affect, the, element, simply, by, their, presence, in, the, start, tag, of, the, element, like, the, ismap, attribute, for, the, img, element, there, are, several, common, attributes, that, may, appear, in, many, elements, the, abbreviation, element, abbr, can, be, used, to, demonstrate, some, of, these, attributes, this, example, displays, as, html, in, most, browsers, pointing, the, cursor, at, the, abbreviation, should, display, the, title, text, hypertext, markup, language, most, elements, take, the, language, related, attribute, dir, to, specify, text, direction, such, as, with, rtl, for, right, to, left, text, in, for, example, arabic, persian, or, hebrew, as, of, version, 4, 0, html, defines, a, set, of, 252, character, entity, references, and, a, set, of, 1, 114, 050, numeric, character, references, both, of, which, allow, individual, characters, to, be, written, via, simple, markup, rather, than, literally, a, literal, character, and, its, markup, counterpart, are, considered, equivalent, and, are, rendered, identically, the, ability, to, escape, characters, in, this, way, allows, for, the, characters, and, when, written, as, lt, and, amp, respectively, to, be, interpreted, as, character, data, rather, than, markup, for, example, a, literal, normally, indicates, the, start, of, a, tag, and, normally, indicates, the, start, of, a, character, entity, reference, or, numeric, character, reference, writing, it, as, amp, or, x26, or, 38, allows, to, be, included, in, the, content, of, an, element, or, in, the, value, of, an, attribute, the, double, quote, character, when, not, used, to, quote, an, attribute, value, must, also, be, escaped, as, quot, or, x22, or, 34, when, it, appears, within, the, attribute, value, itself, equivalently, the, single, quote, character, when, not, used, to, quote, an, attribute, value, must, also, be, escaped, as, x27, or, 39, or, as, apos, in, html5, or, xhtml, documents, when, it, appears, within, the, attribute, value, itself, if, document, authors, overlook, the, need, to, escape, such, characters, some, browsers, can, be, very, forgiving, and, try, to, use, context, to, guess, their, intent, the, result, is, still, invalid, markup, which, makes, the, document, less, accessible, to, other, browsers, and, to, other, user, agents, that, may, try, to, parse, the, document, for, search, and, indexing, purposes, for, example, escaping, also, allows, for, characters, that, are, not, easily, typed, or, that, are, not, available, in, the, document, s, character, encoding, to, be, represented, within, the, element, and, attribute, content, for, example, the, acute, accented, e, a, character, typically, found, only, on, western, european, and, south, american, keyboards, can, be, written, in, any, html, document, as, the, entity, reference, eacute, or, as, the, numeric, references, xe9, or, 233, using, characters, that, are, available, on, all, keyboards, and, are, supported, in, all, character, encodings, unicode, character, encodings, such, as, utf, 8, are, compatible, with, all, modern, browsers, and, allow, direct, access, to, almost, all, the, characters, of, the, world, s, writing, systems, html, defines, several, data, types, for, element, content, such, as, script, data, and, stylesheet, data, and, a, plethora, of, types, for, attribute, values, including, ids, names, uris, numbers, units, of, length, languages, media, descriptors, colors, character, encodings, dates, and, times, and, so, on, all, of, these, data, types, are, specializations, of, character, data, html, documents, are, required, to, start, with, a, document, type, declaration, informally, a, doctype, in, browsers, the, doctype, helps, to, define, the, rendering, mode, particularly, whether, to, use, quirks, mode, the, original, purpose, of, the, doctype, was, to, enable, the, parsing, and, validation, of, html, documents, by, sgml, tools, based, on, the, document, type, definition, dtd, the, dtd, to, which, the, doctype, refers, contains, a, machine, readable, grammar, specifying, the, permitted, and, prohibited, content, for, a, document, conforming, to, such, a, dtd, browsers, on, the, other, hand, do, not, implement, html, as, an, application, of, sgml, and, as, consequence, do, not, read, the, dtd, html5, does, not, define, a, dtd, therefore, in, html5, the, doctype, declaration, is, simpler, and, shorter, an, example, of, an, html, 4, doctype, this, declaration, references, the, dtd, for, the, strict, version, of, html, 4, 01, sgml, based, validators, read, the, dtd, in, order, to, properly, parse, the, document, and, to, perform, validation, in, modern, browsers, a, valid, doctype, activates, standards, mode, as, opposed, to, quirks, mode, in, addition, html, 4, 01, provides, transitional, and, frameset, dtds, as, explained, below, the, transitional, type, is, the, most, inclusive, incorporating, current, tags, as, well, as, older, or, deprecated, tags, with, the, strict, dtd, excluding, deprecated, tags, the, frameset, has, all, tags, necessary, to, make, frames, on, a, page, along, with, the, tags, included, in, transitional, type, semantic, html, is, a, way, of, writing, html, that, emphasizes, the, meaning, of, the, encoded, information, over, its, presentation, look, html, has, included, semantic, markup, from, its, inception, but, has, also, included, presentational, markup, such, as, font, i, and, center, tags, there, are, also, the, semantically, neutral, div, and, span, tags, since, the, late, 1990s, when, cascading, style, sheets, were, beginning, to, work, in, most, browsers, web, authors, have, been, encouraged, to, avoid, the, use, of, presentational, html, markup, with, a, view, to, the, separation, of, content, and, presentation, in, a, 2001, discussion, of, the, semantic, web, tim, berners, lee, and, others, gave, examples, of, ways, in, which, intelligent, software, agents, may, one, day, automatically, crawl, the, web, and, find, filter, and, correlate, previously, unrelated, published, facts, for, the, benefit, of, human, users, such, agents, are, not, commonplace, even, now, but, some, of, the, ideas, of, web, 2, 0, mashups, and, price, comparison, websites, may, be, coming, close, the, main, difference, between, these, web, application, hybrids, and, berners, lee, s, semantic, agents, lies, in, the, fact, that, the, current, aggregation, and, hybridization, of, information, is, usually, designed, by, web, developers, who, already, know, the, web, locations, and, the, api, semantics, of, the, specific, data, they, wish, to, mash, compare, and, combine, an, important, type, of, web, agent, that, does, crawl, and, read, web, pages, automatically, without, prior, knowledge, of, what, it, might, find, is, the, web, crawler, or, search, engine, spider, these, software, agents, are, dependent, on, the, semantic, clarity, of, web, pages, they, find, as, they, use, various, techniques, and, algorithms, to, read, and, index, millions, of, web, pages, a, day, and, provide, web, users, with, search, facilities, without, which, the, world, wide, web, s, usefulness, would, be, greatly, reduced, in, order, for, search, engine, spiders, to, be, able, to, rate, the, significance, of, pieces, of, text, they, find, in, html, documents, and, also, for, those, creating, mashups, and, other, hybrids, as, well, as, for, more, automated, agents, as, they, are, developed, the, semantic, structures, that, exist, in, html, need, to, be, widely, and, uniformly, applied, to, bring, out, the, meaning, of, the, published, text, presentational, markup, tags, are, deprecated, in, current, html, and, xhtml, recommendations, the, majority, of, presentational, features, from, previous, versions, of, html, are, no, longer, allowed, as, they, lead, to, poorer, accessibility, higher, cost, of, site, maintenance, and, larger, document, sizes, good, semantic, html, also, improves, the, accessibility, of, web, documents, see, also, web, content, accessibility, guidelines, for, example, when, a, screen, reader, or, audio, browser, can, correctly, ascertain, the, structure, of, a, document, it, will, not, waste, the, visually, impaired, user, s, time, by, reading, out, repeated, or, irrelevant, information, when, it, has, been, marked, up, correctly, html, documents, can, be, delivered, by, the, same, means, as, any, other, computer, file, however, they, are, most, often, delivered, either, by, http, from, a, web, server, or, by, email, the, world, wide, web, is, composed, primarily, of, html, documents, transmitted, from, web, servers, to, web, browsers, using, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, http, however, http, is, used, to, serve, images, sound, and, other, content, in, addition, to, html, to, allow, the, web, browser, to, know, how, to, handle, each, document, it, receives, other, information, is, transmitted, along, with, the, document, this, meta, data, usually, includes, the, mime, type, e, g, text, html, or, application, xhtml, xml, and, the, character, encoding, see, character, encodings, in, html, in, modern, browsers, the, mime, type, that, is, sent, with, the, html, document, may, affect, how, the, document, is, initially, interpreted, a, document, sent, with, the, xhtml, mime, type, is, expected, to, be, well, formed, xml, syntax, errors, may, cause, the, browser, to, fail, to, render, it, the, same, document, sent, with, the, html, mime, type, might, be, displayed, successfully, since, some, browsers, are, more, lenient, with, html, the, w3c, recommendations, state, that, xhtml, 1, 0, documents, that, follow, guidelines, set, forth, in, the, recommendation, s, appendix, c, may, be, labeled, with, either, mime, type, xhtml, 1, 1, also, states, that, xhtml, 1, 1, documents, should, be, labeled, with, either, mime, type, most, graphical, email, clients, allow, the, use, of, a, subset, of, html, often, ill, defined, to, provide, formatting, and, semantic, markup, not, available, with, plain, text, this, may, include, typographic, information, like, colored, headings, emphasized, and, quoted, text, inline, images, and, diagrams, many, such, clients, include, both, a, gui, editor, for, composing, html, e, mail, messages, and, a, rendering, engine, for, displaying, them, use, of, html, in, e, mail, is, criticized, by, some, because, of, compatibility, issues, because, it, can, help, disguise, phishing, attacks, because, of, accessibility, issues, for, blind, or, visually, impaired, people, because, it, can, confuse, spam, filters, and, because, the, message, size, is, larger, than, plain, text, the, most, common, filename, extension, for, files, containing, html, is, html, a, common, abbreviation, of, this, is, htm, which, originated, because, some, early, operating, systems, and, file, systems, such, as, dos, and, the, limitations, imposed, by, fat, data, structure, limited, file, extensions, to, three, letters, an, html, application, hta, file, extension, hta, is, a, microsoft, windows, application, that, uses, html, and, dynamic, html, in, a, browser, to, provide, the, application, s, graphical, interface, a, regular, html, file, is, confined, to, the, security, model, of, the, web, browser, s, security, communicating, only, to, web, servers, and, manipulating, only, web, page, objects, and, site, cookies, an, hta, runs, as, a, fully, trusted, application, and, therefore, has, more, privileges, like, creation, editing, removal, of, files, and, windows, registry, entries, because, they, operate, outside, the, browser, s, security, model, htas, cannot, be, executed, via, http, but, must, be, downloaded, just, like, an, exe, file, and, executed, from, local, file, system, since, its, inception, html, and, its, associated, protocols, gained, acceptance, relatively, quickly, however, no, clear, standards, existed, in, the, early, years, of, the, language, though, its, creators, originally, conceived, of, html, as, a, semantic, language, devoid, of, presentation, details, practical, uses, pushed, many, presentational, elements, and, attributes, into, the, language, driven, largely, by, the, various, browser, vendors, the, latest, standards, surrounding, html, reflect, efforts, to, overcome, the, sometimes, chaotic, development, of, the, language, and, to, create, a, rational, foundation, for, building, both, meaningful, and, well, presented, documents, to, return, html, to, its, role, as, a, semantic, language, the, w3c, has, developed, style, languages, such, as, css, and, xsl, to, shoulder, the, burden, of, presentation, in, conjunction, the, html, specification, has, slowly, reined, in, the, presentational, elements, there, are, two, axes, differentiating, various, variations, of, html, as, currently, specified, sgml, based, html, versus, xml, based, html, referred, to, as, xhtml, on, one, axis, and, strict, versus, transitional, loose, versus, frameset, on, the, other, axis, one, difference, in, the, latest, html, specifications, lies, in, the, distinction, between, the, sgml, based, specification, and, the, xml, based, specification, the, xml, based, specification, is, usually, called, xhtml, to, distinguish, it, clearly, from, the, more, traditional, definition, however, the, root, element, name, continues, to, be, html, even, in, the, xhtml, specified, html, the, w3c, intended, xhtml, 1, 0, to, be, identical, to, html, 4, 01, except, where, limitations, of, xml, over, the, more, complex, sgml, require, workarounds, because, xhtml, and, html, are, closely, related, they, are, sometimes, documented, in, parallel, in, such, circumstances, some, authors, conflate, the, two, names, as, x, html, or, x, html, like, html, 4, 01, xhtml, 1, 0, has, three, sub, specifications, strict, transitional, and, frameset, aside, from, the, different, opening, declarations, for, a, document, the, differences, between, an, html, 4, 01, and, xhtml, 1, 0, document, in, each, of, the, corresponding, dtds, are, largely, syntactic, the, underlying, syntax, of, html, allows, many, shortcuts, that, xhtml, does, not, such, as, elements, with, optional, opening, or, closing, tags, and, even, empty, elements, which, must, not, have, an, end, tag, by, contrast, xhtml, requires, all, elements, to, have, an, opening, tag, and, a, closing, tag, xhtml, however, also, introduces, a, new, shortcut, an, xhtml, tag, may, be, opened, and, closed, within, the, same, tag, by, including, a, slash, before, the, end, of, the, tag, like, this, br, the, introduction, of, this, shorthand, which, is, not, used, in, the, sgml, declaration, for, html, 4, 01, may, confuse, earlier, software, unfamiliar, with, this, new, convention, a, fix, for, this, is, to, include, a, space, before, closing, the, tag, as, such, br, to, understand, the, subtle, differences, between, html, and, xhtml, consider, the, transformation, of, a, valid, and, well, formed, xhtml, 1, 0, document, that, adheres, to, appendix, c, see, below, into, a, valid, html, 4, 01, document, making, this, translation, requires, the, following, steps, those, are, the, main, changes, necessary, to, translate, a, document, from, xhtml, 1, 0, to, html, 4, 01, to, translate, from, html, to, xhtml, would, also, require, the, addition, of, any, omitted, opening, or, closing, tags, whether, coding, in, html, or, xhtml, it, may, just, be, best, to, always, include, the, optional, tags, within, an, html, document, rather, than, remembering, which, tags, can, be, omitted, a, well, formed, xhtml, document, adheres, to, all, the, syntax, requirements, of, xml, a, valid, document, adheres, to, the, content, specification, for, xhtml, which, describes, the, document, structure, the, w3c, recommends, several, conventions, to, ensure, an, easy, migration, between, html, and, xhtml, see, html, compatibility, guidelines, the, following, steps, can, be, applied, to, xhtml, 1, 0, documents, only, by, carefully, following, the, w3c, s, compatibility, guidelines, a, user, agent, should, be, able, to, interpret, the, document, equally, as, html, or, xhtml, for, documents, that, are, xhtml, 1, 0, and, have, been, made, compatible, in, this, way, the, w3c, permits, them, to, be, served, either, as, html, with, a, text, html, mime, type, or, as, xhtml, with, an, application, xhtml, xml, or, application, xml, mime, type, when, delivered, as, xhtml, browsers, should, use, an, xml, parser, which, adheres, strictly, to, the, xml, specifications, for, parsing, the, document, s, contents, html, 4, defined, three, different, versions, of, the, language, strict, transitional, once, called, loose, and, frameset, the, strict, version, is, intended, for, new, documents, and, is, considered, best, practice, while, the, transitional, and, frameset, versions, were, developed, to, make, it, easier, to, transition, documents, that, conformed, to, older, html, specifications, or, did, not, conform, to, any, specification, to, a, version, of, html, 4, the, transitional, and, frameset, versions, allow, for, presentational, markup, which, is, omitted, in, the, strict, version, instead, cascading, style, sheets, are, encouraged, to, improve, the, presentation, of, html, documents, because, xhtml, 1, only, defines, an, xml, syntax, for, the, language, defined, by, html, 4, the, same, differences, apply, to, xhtml, 1, as, well, the, transitional, version, allows, the, following, parts, of, the, vocabulary, which, are, not, included, in, the, strict, version, the, frameset, version, includes, everything, in, the, transitional, version, as, well, as, the, frameset, element, used, instead, of, body, and, the, frame, element, in, addition, to, the, above, transitional, differences, the, frameset, specifications, whether, xhtml, 1, 0, or, html, 4, 01, specify, a, different, content, model, with, frameset, replacing, body, that, contains, either, frame, elements, or, optionally, noframes, with, a, body, as, this, list, demonstrates, the, loose, versions, of, the, specification, are, maintained, for, legacy, support, however, contrary, to, popular, misconceptions, the, move, to, xhtml, does, not, imply, a, removal, of, this, legacy, support, rather, the, x, in, xml, stands, for, extensible, and, the, w3c, is, modularizing, the, entire, specification, and, opens, it, up, to, independent, extensions, the, primary, achievement, in, the, move, from, xhtml, 1, 0, to, xhtml, 1, 1, is, the, modularization, of, the, entire, specification, the, strict, version, of, html, is, deployed, in, xhtml, 1, 1, through, a, set, of, modular, extensions, to, the, base, xhtml, 1, 1, specification, likewise, someone, looking, for, the, loose, transitional, or, frameset, specifications, will, find, similar, extended, xhtml, 1, 1, support, much, of, it, is, contained, in, the, legacy, or, frame, modules, modularization, also, allows, for, separate, features, to, develop, on, their, own, timetable, so, for, example, xhtml, 1, 1, will, allow, quicker, migration, to, emerging, xml, standards, such, as, mathml, a, presentational, and, semantic, math, language, based, on, xml, and, xforms, a, new, highly, advanced, web, form, technology, to, replace, the, existing, html, forms, in, summary, the, html, 4, specification, primarily, reined, in, all, the, various, html, implementations, into, a, single, clearly, written, specification, based, on, sgml, xhtml, 1, 0, ported, this, specification, as, is, to, the, new, xml, defined, specification, next, xhtml, 1, 1, takes, advantage, of, the, extensible, nature, of, xml, and, modularizes, the, whole, specification, xhtml, 2, 0, was, intended, to, be, the, first, step, in, adding, new, features, to, the, specification, in, a, standards, body, based, approach, the, html, living, standard, which, is, developed, by, whatwg, is, the, official, version, while, w3c, html5, is, no, longer, separate, from, whatwg, there, are, some, wysiwyg, editors, what, you, see, is, what, you, get, in, which, the, user, lays, out, everything, as, it, is, to, appear, in, the, html, document, using, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, often, similar, to, word, processors, the, editor, renders, the, document, rather, than, showing, the, code, so, authors, do, not, require, extensive, knowledge, of, html, the, wysiwyg, editing, model, has, been, criticized, primarily, because, of, the, low, quality, of, the, generated, code, there, are, voices, advocating, a, change, to, the, wysiwym, model, what, you, see, is, what, you, mean, wysiwyg, editors, remain, a, controversial, topic, because, of, their, perceived, flaws, such, as
