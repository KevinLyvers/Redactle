a, satellite, navigation, or, satnav, system, is, a, system, that, uses, satellites, to, provide, autonomous, geopositioning, a, satellite, navigation, system, with, global, coverage, is, termed, global, navigation, satellite, system, gnss, as, of, 2024, four, global, systems, are, operational, the, united, states, s, global, positioning, system, gps, russia, s, global, navigation, satellite, system, glonass, china, s, beidou, navigation, satellite, system, bds, and, the, european, union, s, galileo, satellite, based, augmentation, systems, sbas, designed, to, enhance, the, accuracy, of, gnss, include, japan, s, quasi, zenith, satellite, system, qzss, and, the, european, egnos, both, based, on, gps, stand, alone, operational, regional, navigation, satellite, systems, rnss, include, earlier, generations, of, the, beidou, navigation, system, and, the, current, indian, regional, navigation, satellite, system, irnss, or, navic, satellite, navigation, devices, determine, their, location, longitude, latitude, and, altitude, elevation, to, high, precision, within, a, few, centimeters, to, meters, using, time, signals, transmitted, along, a, line, of, sight, by, radio, from, satellites, the, system, can, be, used, for, providing, position, navigation, or, for, tracking, the, position, of, something, fitted, with, a, receiver, satellite, tracking, the, signals, also, allow, the, electronic, receiver, to, calculate, the, current, local, time, to, a, high, precision, which, allows, time, synchronisation, these, uses, are, collectively, known, as, positioning, navigation, and, timing, pnt, satnav, systems, operate, independently, of, any, telephonic, or, internet, reception, though, these, technologies, can, enhance, the, usefulness, of, the, positioning, information, generated, global, coverage, for, each, system, is, generally, achieved, by, a, satellite, constellation, of, 18, 30, medium, earth, orbit, meo, satellites, spread, between, several, orbital, planes, the, actual, systems, vary, but, all, use, orbital, inclinations, of, 50, and, orbital, periods, of, roughly, twelve, hours, at, an, altitude, of, about, 20, 000, kilometres, or, 12, 000, miles, gnss, systems, that, provide, enhanced, accuracy, and, integrity, monitoring, usable, for, civil, navigation, are, classified, as, follows, by, their, roles, in, the, navigation, system, systems, can, be, classified, as, as, many, of, the, global, gnss, systems, and, augmentation, systems, use, similar, frequencies, and, signals, around, l1, many, multi, gnss, receivers, capable, of, using, multiple, systems, have, been, produced, while, some, systems, strive, to, interoperate, with, gps, as, well, as, possible, by, providing, the, same, clock, others, do, not, ground, based, radio, navigation, is, decades, old, the, decca, loran, gee, and, omega, systems, used, terrestrial, longwave, radio, transmitters, which, broadcast, a, radio, pulse, from, a, known, master, location, followed, by, a, pulse, repeated, from, a, number, of, slave, stations, the, delay, between, the, reception, of, the, master, signal, and, the, slave, signals, allowed, the, receiver, to, deduce, the, distance, to, each, of, the, slaves, providing, a, fix, the, first, satellite, navigation, system, was, transit, a, system, deployed, by, the, us, military, in, the, 1960s, transit, s, operation, was, based, on, the, doppler, effect, the, satellites, travelled, on, well, known, paths, and, broadcast, their, signals, on, a, well, known, radio, frequency, the, received, frequency, will, differ, slightly, from, the, broadcast, frequency, because, of, the, movement, of, the, satellite, with, respect, to, the, receiver, by, monitoring, this, frequency, shift, over, a, short, time, interval, the, receiver, can, determine, its, location, to, one, side, or, the, other, of, the, satellite, and, several, such, measurements, combined, with, a, precise, knowledge, of, the, satellite, s, orbit, can, fix, a, particular, position, satellite, orbital, position, errors, are, caused, by, radio, wave, refraction, gravity, field, changes, as, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, is, not, uniform, and, other, phenomena, a, team, led, by, harold, l, jury, of, pan, am, aerospace, division, in, florida, from, 1970, to, 1973, found, solutions, and, or, corrections, for, many, error, sources, using, real, time, data, and, recursive, estimation, the, systematic, and, residual, errors, were, narrowed, down, to, accuracy, sufficient, for, navigation, part, of, an, orbiting, satellite, s, broadcast, includes, its, precise, orbital, data, originally, the, us, naval, observatory, usno, continuously, observed, the, precise, orbits, of, these, satellites, as, a, satellite, s, orbit, deviated, the, usno, sent, the, updated, information, to, the, satellite, subsequent, broadcasts, from, an, updated, satellite, would, contain, its, most, recent, ephemeris, modern, systems, are, more, direct, the, satellite, broadcasts, a, signal, that, contains, orbital, data, from, which, the, position, of, the, satellite, can, be, calculated, and, the, precise, time, the, signal, was, transmitted, orbital, data, include, a, rough, almanac, for, all, satellites, to, aid, in, finding, them, and, a, precise, ephemeris, for, this, satellite, the, orbital, ephemeris, is, transmitted, in, a, data, message, that, is, superimposed, on, a, code, that, serves, as, a, timing, reference, the, satellite, uses, an, atomic, clock, to, maintain, synchronization, of, all, the, satellites, in, the, constellation, the, receiver, compares, the, time, of, broadcast, encoded, in, the, transmission, of, three, at, sea, level, or, four, which, allows, an, altitude, calculation, also, different, satellites, measuring, the, time, of, flight, to, each, satellite, several, such, measurements, can, be, made, at, the, same, time, to, different, satellites, allowing, a, continual, fix, to, be, generated, in, real, time, using, an, adapted, version, of, trilateration, see, gnss, positioning, calculation, for, details, each, distance, measurement, regardless, of, the, system, being, used, places, the, receiver, on, a, spherical, shell, at, the, measured, distance, from, the, broadcaster, by, taking, several, such, measurements, and, then, looking, for, a, point, where, they, meet, a, fix, is, generated, however, in, the, case, of, fast, moving, receivers, the, position, of, the, signal, moves, as, signals, are, received, from, several, satellites, in, addition, the, radio, signals, slow, slightly, as, they, pass, through, the, ionosphere, and, this, slowing, varies, with, the, receiver, s, angle, to, the, satellite, because, that, changes, the, distance, through, the, ionosphere, the, basic, computation, thus, attempts, to, find, the, shortest, directed, line, tangent, to, four, oblate, spherical, shells, centred, on, four, satellites, satellite, navigation, receivers, reduce, errors, by, using, combinations, of, signals, from, multiple, satellites, and, multiple, correlators, and, then, using, techniques, such, as, kalman, filtering, to, combine, the, noisy, partial, and, constantly, changing, data, into, a, single, estimate, for, position, time, and, velocity, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, is, applied, to, gps, time, correction, the, net, result, is, that, time, on, a, gps, satellite, clock, advances, faster, than, a, clock, on, the, ground, by, about, 38, microseconds, per, day, the, original, motivation, for, satellite, navigation, was, for, military, applications, satellite, navigation, allows, precision, in, the, delivery, of, weapons, to, targets, greatly, increasing, their, lethality, whilst, reducing, inadvertent, casualties, from, mis, directed, weapons, see, guided, bomb, satellite, navigation, also, allows, forces, to, be, directed, and, to, locate, themselves, more, easily, reducing, the, fog, of, war, now, a, global, navigation, satellite, system, such, as, galileo, is, used, to, determine, users, location, and, the, location, of, other, people, or, objects, at, any, given, moment, the, range, of, application, of, satellite, navigation, in, the, future, is, enormous, including, both, the, public, and, private, sectors, across, numerous, market, segments, such, as, science, transport, agriculture, insurance, energy, etc, the, ability, to, supply, satellite, navigation, signals, is, also, the, ability, to, deny, their, availability, the, operator, of, a, satellite, navigation, system, potentially, has,
