a, wire, is, a, flexible, round, bar, of, metal, wires, are, commonly, formed, by, drawing, the, metal, through, a, hole, in, a, die, or, draw, plate, wire, gauges, come, in, various, standard, sizes, as, expressed, in, terms, of, a, gauge, number, or, cross, sectional, area, wires, are, used, to, bear, mechanical, loads, often, in, the, form, of, wire, rope, in, electricity, and, telecommunications, signals, a, wire, can, refer, to, an, electrical, cable, which, can, contain, a, solid, core, of, a, single, wire, or, separate, strands, in, stranded, or, braided, forms, usually, cylindrical, in, geometry, wire, can, also, be, made, in, square, hexagonal, flattened, rectangular, or, other, cross, sections, either, for, decorative, purposes, or, for, technical, purposes, such, as, high, efficiency, voice, coils, in, loudspeakers, edge, wound, coil, springs, such, as, the, slinky, toy, are, made, of, special, flattened, wire, in, antiquity, jewelry, often, contains, large, amounts, of, wire, in, the, form, of, chains, and, applied, decoration, that, is, accurately, made, and, which, must, have, been, produced, by, some, efficient, if, not, technically, advanced, means, in, some, cases, strips, cut, from, metal, sheet, were, made, into, wire, by, pulling, them, through, perforations, in, stone, beads, this, causes, the, strips, to, fold, round, on, themselves, to, form, thin, tubes, this, strip, drawing, technique, was, in, use, in, egypt, by, the, 2nd, dynasty, c, 2890, c, 2686, bce, from, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, most, of, the, gold, wires, in, jewelry, are, characterized, by, seam, lines, that, follow, a, spiral, path, along, the, wire, such, twisted, strips, can, be, converted, into, solid, round, wires, by, rolling, them, between, flat, surfaces, or, the, strip, wire, drawing, method, the, strip, twist, wire, manufacturing, method, was, superseded, by, drawing, in, the, ancient, old, world, sometime, between, about, the, 8th, and, 10th, centuries, ad, there, is, some, evidence, for, the, use, of, drawing, further, east, prior, to, this, period, square, and, hexagonal, wires, were, possibly, made, using, a, swaging, technique, in, this, method, a, metal, rod, was, struck, between, grooved, metal, blocks, or, between, a, grooved, punch, and, a, grooved, metal, anvil, swaging, is, of, great, antiquity, possibly, dating, to, the, beginning, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, in, egypt, and, in, the, bronze, and, iron, ages, in, europe, for, torcs, and, fibulae, twisted, square, section, wires, are, a, very, common, filigree, decoration, in, early, etruscan, jewelry, in, about, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, a, new, category, of, decorative, tube, was, introduced, which, imitated, a, line, of, granules, true, beaded, wire, produced, by, mechanically, distorting, a, round, section, wire, appeared, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, italy, in, the, seventh, century, bce, perhaps, disseminated, by, the, phoenicians, beaded, wire, continued, to, be, used, in, jewellery, into, modern, times, although, it, largely, fell, out, of, favour, in, about, the, tenth, century, ce, when, two, drawn, round, wires, twisted, together, to, form, what, are, termed, ropes, provided, a, simpler, to, make, alternative, a, forerunner, to, beaded, wire, may, be, the, notched, strips, and, wires, which, first, occur, from, around, 2000, bce, in, anatolia, wire, was, drawn, in, england, from, the, medieval, period, the, wire, was, used, to, make, wool, cards, and, pins, manufactured, goods, whose, import, was, prohibited, by, edward, iv, in, 1463, the, first, wire, mill, in, great, britain, was, established, at, tintern, in, about, 1568, by, the, founders, of, the, company, of, mineral, and, battery, works, who, had, a, monopoly, on, this, apart, from, their, second, wire, mill, at, nearby, whitebrook, there, were, no, other, wire, mills, before, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, despite, the, existence, of, mills, the, drawing, of, wire, down, to, fine, sizes, continued, to, be, done, manually, according, to, a, description, in, the, early, 20th, century, ire, is, usually, drawn, of, cylindrical, form, but, it, may, be, made, of, any, desired, section, by, varying, the, outline, of, the, holes, in, the, draw, plate, through, which, it, is, passed, in, the, process, of, manufacture, the, draw, plate, or, die, is, a, piece, of, hard, cast, iron, or, hard, steel, or, for, fine, work, it, may, be, a, diamond, or, a, ruby, the, object, of, utilising, precious, stones, is, to, enable, the, dies, to, be, used, for, a, considerable, period, without, losing, their, size, and, so, producing, wire, of, incorrect, diameter, diamond, dies, must, be, rebored, when, they, have, lost, their, original, diameter, of, hole, but, metal, dies, are, brought, down, to, size, again, by, hammering, up, the, hole, and, then, drifting, it, out, to, correct, diameter, with, a, punch, wire, is, often, reduced, to, the, desired, diameter, and, properties, by, repeated, drawing, through, progressively, smaller, dies, or, traditionally, holes, in, draw, plates, after, a, number, of, passes, the, wire, may, be, annealed, to, facilitate, more, drawing, or, if, it, is, a, finished, product, to, maximise, ductility, and, conductivity, electrical, wires, are, usually, covered, with, insulating, materials, such, as, plastic, rubber, like, polymers, or, varnish, insulating, and, jacketing, of, wires, and, cables, is, nowadays, done, by, passing, them, through, an, extruder, formerly, materials, used, for, insulation, included, treated, cloth, or, paper, and, various, oil, based, products, since, the, mid, 1960s, plastic, and, polymers, exhibiting, properties, similar, to, rubber, have, predominated, two, or, more, wires, may, be, wrapped, concentrically, separated, by, insulation, to, form, coaxial, cable, the, wire, or, cable, may, be, further, protected, with, substances, like, paraffin, some, kind, of, preservative, compound, bitumen, lead, aluminum, sheathing, or, steel, taping, stranding, or, covering, machines, wind, material, onto, wire, which, passes, through, quickly, some, of, the, smallest, machines, for, cotton, covering, have, a, large, drum, which, grips, the, wire, and, moves, it, through, toothed, gears, the, wire, passes, through, the, centre, of, disks, mounted, above, a, long, bed, and, the, disks, carry, each, a, number, of, bobbins, varying, from, six, to, twelve, or, more, in, different, machines, a, supply, of, covering, material, is, wound, on, each, bobbin, and, the, end, is, led, on, to, the, wire, which, occupies, a, central, position, relatively, to, the, bobbins, the, latter, being, revolved, at, a, suitable, speed, bodily, with, their, disks, the, cotton, is, consequently, served, on, to, the, wire, winding, in, spiral, fashion, so, as, to, overlap, if, many, strands, are, required, the, disks, are, duplicated, so, that, as, many, as, sixty, spools, may, be, carried, the, second, set, of, strands, being, laid, over, the, first, for, heavier, cables, that, are, used, for, electric, light, and, power, as, well, as, submarine, cables, the, machines, are, somewhat, different, in, construction, the, wire, is, still, carried, through, a, hollow, shaft, but, the, bobbins, or, spools, of, covering, material, are, set, with, their, spindles, at, right, angles, to, the, axis, of, the, wire, and, they, lie, in, a, circular, cage, which, rotates, on, rollers, below, the, various, strands, coming, from, the, spools, at, various, parts, of, the, circumference, of, the, cage, all, lead, to, a, disk, at, the, end, of, the, hollow, shaft, this, disk, has, perforations, through, which, each, of, the, strands, pass, thence, being, immediately, wrapped, on, the, cable, which, slides, through, a, bearing, at, this, point, toothed, gears, having, certain, definite, ratios, are, used, to, cause, the, winding, drum, for, the, cable, and, the, cage, for, the, spools, to, rotate, at, suitable, relative, speeds, which, do, not, vary, the, cages, are, multiplied, for, stranding, with, many, tapes, or, strands, so, that, a, machine, may, have, six, bobbins, on, one, cage, and, twelve, on, the, other, solid, wire, also, called, solid, core, or, single, strand, wire, consists, of, one, piece, of, metal, wire, solid, wire, is, useful, for, wiring, breadboards, solid, wire, is, cheaper, to, manufacture, than, stranded, wire, and, is, used, where, there, is, little, need, for, flexibility, in, the, wire, solid, wire, also, provides, mechanical, ruggedness, and, because, it, has, relatively, less, surface, area, which, is, exposed, to, attack, by, corrosives, protection, against, the, environment, stranded, wire, is, composed, of, a, number, of, small, wires, bundled, or, wrapped, together, to, form, a, larger, conductor, stranded, wire, is, more, flexible, than, solid, wire, of, the, same, total, cross, sectional, area, stranded, wire, is, used, when, higher, resistance, to, metal, fatigue, is, required, such, situations, include, connections, between, circuit, boards, in, multi, printed, circuit, board, devices, where, the, rigidity, of, solid, wire, would, produce, too, much, stress, as, a, result, of, movement, during, assembly, or, servicing, a, c, line, cords, for, appliances, musical, instrument, cables, computer, mouse, cables, welding, electrode, cables, control, cables, connecting, moving, machine, parts, mining, machine, cables, trailing, machine, cables, and, numerous, others, at, high, frequencies, current, travels, near, the, surface, of, the, wire, because, of, the, skin, effect, resulting, in, increased, power, loss, in, the, wire, stranded, wire, might, seem, to, reduce, this, effect, since, the, total, surface, area, of, the, strands, is, greater, than, the, surface, area, of, the, equivalent, solid, wire, but, ordinary, stranded, wire, does, not, reduce, the, skin, effect, because, all, the, strands, are, short, circuited, together, and, behave, as, a, single, conductor, a, stranded, wire, will, have, higher, resistance, than, a, solid, wire, of, the, same, diameter, because, the, cross, section, of, the, stranded, wire, is, not, all, copper, there, are, unavoidable, gaps, between, the, strands, this, is, the, circle, packing, problem, for, circles, within, a, circle, a, stranded, wire, with, the, same, cross, section, of, conductor, as, a, solid, wire, is, said, to, have, the, same, equivalent, gauge, and, is, always, a, larger, diameter, however, for, many, high, frequency, applications, proximity, effect, is, more, severe, than, skin, effect, and, in, some, limited, cases, simple, stranded, wire, can, reduce, proximity, effect, for, better, performance, at, high, frequencies, litz, wire, which, has, the, individual, strands, insulated, and, twisted, in, special, patterns, may, be, used, the, more, individual, wire, strands, in, a, wire, bundle, the, more, flexible, kink, resistant, break, resistant, and, stronger, the, wire, becomes, however, more, strands, increases, manufacturing, complexity, and, cost, for, geometrical, reasons, the, lowest, number, of, strands, usually, seen, is, 7, one, in, the, middle, with, 6, surrounding, it, in, close, contact, the, next, level, up, is, 19, which, is, another, layer, of, 12, strands, on, top, of, the, 7, after, that, the, number, varies, but, 37, and, 49, are, common, then, in, the, 70, to, 100, range, the, number, is, no, longer, exact, larger, numbers, than, that, are, typically, found, only, in, very, large, cables, for, application, where, the, wire, moves, 19, is, the, lowest, that, should, be, used, 7, should, only, be, used, in, applications, where, the, wire, is, placed, and, then, does, not, move, and, 49, is, much, better, for, applications, with, constant, repeated, movement, such, as, assembly, robots, and, headphone, wires, 70, to, 100, is, mandatory, for, applications, that, need, even, more, flexibility, even, more, strands, are, used, welding, cables, are, the, usual, example, but, also, any, application, that, needs, to, move, wire, in, tight, areas, one, example, is, a, 2, 0, wire, made, from, 5, 292, strands, of, no, 36, gauge, wire, the, strands, are, organized, by, first, creating, a, bundle, of, 7, strands, then, 7, of, these, bundles, are, put, together, into, super, bundles, finally, 108, super, bundles, are, used, to, make, the, final, cable, each, group, of, wires, is, wound, in, a, helix, so, that, when, the, wire, is, flexed, the, part, of, a, bundle, that, is, stretched, moves, around, the, helix, to, a, part, that, is, compressed, to, allow, the, wire, to, have, less, stress, prefused, wire, is, stranded, wire, made, up, of, strands, that, are, heavily, tinned, then, fused, together, prefused, wire, has, many, of, the, properties, of, solid, wire, except, it, is, less, likely, to, break, a, braided, wire, consists, of, a, number, of, small, strands, of, wire, braided, together, braided, wires, do, not, break, easily, when, flexed, braided, wires, are, often, suitable, as, an, electromagnetic, shield, in, noise, reduction, cables, wire, has, many, uses, it, forms, the, raw, material, of, many, important, manufacturers, such, as, the, wire, netting, industry, engineered, springs, wire, cloth, making, and, wire, rope, spinning, in, which, it, occupies, a, place, analogous, to, a, textile, fiber, wire, cloth, of, all, degrees, of, strength, and, fineness, of, mesh, is, used, for, sifting, and, screening, machinery, for, draining, paper, pulp, for, window, screens, and, for, many, other, purposes, vast, quantities, of, aluminium, copper, nickel, and, steel, wire, are, employed, for, telephone, and, data, cables, and, as, conductors, in, electric, power, transmission, and, heating, it, is, in, no, less, demand, for, fencing, and, much, is, consumed, in, the, construction, of, suspension, bridges, and, cages, etc, in, the, manufacture, of, stringed, musical, instruments, and, scientific, instruments, wire, is, again, largely, used, carbon, and, stainless, spring, steel, wire, have, significant, applications, in, engineered, springs, for, critical, automotive, or, industrial, manufactured, parts, components, pin, and, hairpin, making, the, needle, and, fish, hook, industries, nail, peg, and, rivet, making, and, carding, machinery, consume, large, amounts, of, wire, as, feedstock, not, all, metals, and, metallic, alloys, possess, the, physical, properties, necessary, to, make, useful, wire, the, metals, must, in, the, first, place, be, ductile, and, strong, in, tension, the, quality, on, which, the, utility, of, wire, principally, depends, the, principal, metals, suitable, for, wire, possessing, almost, equal, ductility, are, platinum, silver, iron, copper, aluminium, and, gold, and, it, is, only, from, these, and, certain, of, their, alloys, with, other, metals, principally, brass, and, bronze, that, wire, is, prepared, by, careful, treatment, extremely, thin, wire, can, be, produced, special, purpose, wire, is, however, made, from, other, metals, e, g, tungsten, wire, for, light, bulb, and, vacuum, tube, filaments, because, of, its, high, melting, temperature, copper, wires, are, also, plated, with, other, metals, such, as, tin, nickel, and, silver, to, handle, different, temperatures, provide, lubrication, and, provide, easier, stripping, of, rubber, insulation, from, copper, metallic, wires, are, often, used, for, the, lower, pitched, sound, producing, strings, in, stringed, instruments, such, as, violins, cellos, and, guitars, and, percussive, string, instruments, such, as, pianos, dulcimers, dobros, and, cimbaloms, to, increase, the, mass, per, unit, length, and, thus, lower, the, pitch, of, the, sound, even, further, the, main, wire, may, sometimes, be, helically, wrapped, with, another, finer, strand, of, wire, such, musical, strings, are, said, to, be, overspun, the, added, wire, may, be, circular, in, cross, section, round, wound, or, flattened, before, winding, flat, wound, examples, include
