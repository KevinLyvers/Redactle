a, gear, or, gearwheel, is, a, rotating, machine, part, typically, used, to, transmit, rotational, motion, and, or, torque, by, means, of, a, series, of, teeth, that, engage, with, compatible, teeth, of, another, gear, or, other, part, the, teeth, can, be, integral, saliences, or, cavities, machined, on, the, part, or, separate, pegs, inserted, into, it, in, the, latter, case, the, gear, is, usually, called, a, cogwheel, a, cog, may, be, one, of, those, pegs, or, the, whole, gear, two, or, more, meshing, gears, are, called, a, gear, train, the, smaller, member, of, a, pair, of, meshing, gears, is, often, called, pinion, most, commonly, gears, and, gear, trains, can, be, used, to, trade, torque, for, rotational, speed, between, two, axles, or, other, rotating, parts, and, or, to, change, the, axis, of, rotation, and, or, to, invert, the, sense, of, rotation, a, gear, may, also, be, used, to, transmit, linear, force, and, or, linear, motion, to, a, rack, a, straight, bar, with, a, row, of, compatible, teeth, gears, are, among, the, most, common, mechanical, parts, they, come, in, a, great, variety, of, shapes, and, materials, and, are, used, for, many, different, functions, and, applications, diameters, may, range, from, a, few, m, in, micromachines, to, a, few, mm, in, watches, and, toys, to, over, 10, metres, in, some, mining, equipment, other, types, of, parts, that, are, somewhat, similar, in, shape, and, function, to, gears, include, the, sprocket, which, is, meant, to, engage, with, a, link, chain, instead, of, another, gear, and, the, timing, pulley, meant, to, engage, a, timing, belt, most, gears, are, round, and, have, equal, teeth, designed, to, operate, as, smoothly, as, possible, but, there, are, several, applications, for, non, circular, gears, and, the, geneva, drive, has, an, extremely, uneven, operation, by, design, gears, can, be, seen, are, instances, of, the, basic, lever, machine, when, a, small, gear, drives, a, larger, one, the, mechanical, advantage, of, this, ideal, lever, causes, the, torque, t, to, increase, but, the, rotational, speed, to, decrease, the, opposite, effect, is, obtained, when, a, large, gear, drives, a, small, one, the, changes, are, proportional, to, the, gear, ratio, r, the, ratio, of, the, tooth, counts, namely, t, 2, t, 1, r, n, 2, n, 1, and, 2, 1, 1, r, n, 1, n, 2, depending, on, the, geometry, of, the, pair, the, sense, of, rotation, may, also, be, inverted, from, clockwise, to, anti, clockwise, or, vice, versa, most, vehicles, have, a, transmission, or, gearbox, containing, a, set, of, gears, that, can, be, meshed, in, multiple, configurations, the, gearbox, lets, the, operator, vary, the, torque, that, is, applied, to, the, wheels, without, changing, the, engine, s, speed, gearboxes, are, used, also, in, many, other, machines, such, as, lathes, and, conveyor, belts, in, all, those, cases, terms, like, first, gear, high, gear, and, reverse, gear, refer, to, the, overall, torque, ratios, of, different, meshing, configurations, rather, than, to, specific, physical, gears, these, terms, may, be, applied, even, when, the, vehicle, does, not, actually, contain, gears, as, in, a, continuously, variable, transmission, the, earliest, surviving, gears, date, from, the, 4th, century, bc, in, china, zhan, guo, times, late, east, zhou, dynasty, which, have, been, preserved, at, the, luoyang, museum, of, henan, province, china, in, europe, aristotle, mentions, gears, around, 330, bc, as, wheel, drives, in, windlasses, he, observed, that, the, direction, of, rotation, is, reversed, when, one, gear, wheel, drives, another, gear, wheel, philon, of, byzantium, was, one, of, the, first, who, used, gears, in, water, raising, devices, gears, appear, in, works, connected, to, hero, of, alexandria, in, roman, egypt, circa, ad, 50, but, can, be, traced, back, to, the, mechanics, of, the, library, of, alexandria, in, 3rd, century, bc, ptolemaic, egypt, and, were, greatly, developed, by, the, greek, polymath, archimedes, 287, 212, bc, the, earliest, surviving, gears, in, europe, were, found, in, the, antikythera, mechanism, an, example, of, a, very, early, and, intricate, geared, device, designed, to, calculate, astronomical, positions, of, the, sun, moon, and, planets, and, predict, eclipses, its, time, of, construction, is, now, estimated, between, 150, and, 100, bc, the, chinese, engineer, ma, jun, c, 200, 265, ad, described, a, south, pointing, chariot, a, set, of, differential, gears, connected, to, the, wheels, and, to, a, pointer, on, top, of, the, chariot, kept, the, direction, of, latter, unchanged, as, the, chariot, turned, another, early, surviving, example, of, geared, mechanism, is, a, complex, calendrical, device, showing, the, phase, of, the, moon, the, day, of, the, month, and, the, places, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, in, the, zodiac, was, invented, in, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, early, 6th, century, ad, geared, mechanical, water, clocks, were, built, in, china, by, 725, ad, around, 1221, ad, a, geared, astrolabe, was, built, in, isfahan, showing, the, position, of, the, moon, in, the, zodiac, and, its, phase, and, the, number, of, days, since, new, moon, the, worm, gear, was, invented, in, the, indian, subcontinent, for, use, in, roller, cotton, gins, some, time, during, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, a, complex, astronomical, clock, called, the, astrarium, was, built, between, 1348, and, 1364, by, giovanni, dondi, dell, orologio, it, had, seven, faces, and, 107, moving, parts, it, showed, the, positions, of, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, five, planets, then, known, as, well, as, religious, feast, days, the, salisbury, cathedral, clock, built, in, 1386, it, is, the, world, s, oldest, still, working, geared, mechanical, clock, differential, gears, were, used, by, the, british, clock, maker, joseph, williamson, in, 1720, however, the, oldest, functioning, gears, by, far, were, created, by, nature, and, are, seen, in, the, hind, legs, of, the, nymphs, of, the, planthopper, insect, issus, coleoptratus, the, word, gear, is, probably, from, old, norse, g, rvi, plural, g, rvar, apparel, gear, related, to, g, ra, g, rva, to, make, construct, build, set, in, order, prepare, a, common, verb, in, old, norse, used, in, a, wide, range, of, situations, from, writing, a, book, to, dressing, meat, in, this, context, the, meaning, of, toothed, wheel, in, machinery, first, attested, 1520s, specific, mechanical, sense, of, parts, by, which, a, motor, communicates, motion, is, from, 1814, specifically, of, a, vehicle, bicycle, automobile, etc, by, 1888, a, cog, is, a, tooth, on, a, wheel, from, middle, english, cogge, from, old, norse, compare, norwegian, kugg, cog, swedish, kugg, kugge, cog, tooth, from, proto, germanic, kugg, compare, dutch, kogge, cogboat, german, kock, from, proto, indo, european, gug, hump, ball, compare, lithuanian, gug, pommel, hump, hill, from, pie, g, w, to, bend, arch, first, used, c, 1300, in, the, sense, of, a, wheel, having, teeth, or, cogs, late, 14c, tooth, on, a, wheel, cog, wheel, early, 15c, the, gears, of, the, antikythera, mechanism, are, made, of, bronze, and, the, earliest, surviving, chinese, gears, are, made, of, iron, these, metals, as, well, as, tin, have, been, generally, used, for, clocks, and, similar, mechanisms, to, this, day, historically, large, gears, such, as, used, in, flour, mills, were, commonly, made, of, wood, rather, than, metal, they, were, cogwheels, made, by, inserting, a, series, of, wooden, pegs, or, cogs, around, the, rim, of, a, wheel, the, cogs, were, often, made, of, maple, wood, wooden, gears, have, been, gradually, replaced, by, ones, made, or, metal, such, as, cast, iron, at, first, then, steel, and, aluminum, steel, is, most, commonly, used, because, of, its, high, strength, to, weight, ratio, and, low, cost, aluminum, is, not, as, strong, as, steel, for, the, same, geometry, but, is, lighter, and, easier, to, machine, powder, metallurgy, may, be, used, with, alloys, that, cannot, be, easily, cast, or, machined, still, because, of, cost, or, other, considerations, some, early, metal, gears, had, wooden, cogs, each, tooth, forming, a, type, of, specialised, through, mortise, and, tenon, joint, more, recently, engineering, plastics, and, composite, materials, have, been, replacing, metals, in, many, applications, especially, those, with, moderate, speed, and, torque, they, are, not, as, strong, as, steel, but, are, cheaper, can, be, mass, manufactured, by, injection, molding, don, t, need, lubrication, plastic, gears, may, even, be, intentionally, designed, to, be, the, weakest, part, in, a, mechanism, so, that, in, case, of, jamming, they, will, fail, first, and, thus, avoid, damage, to, more, expensive, parts, such, sacrificial, gears, may, be, a, simpler, alternative, to, other, overload, protection, devices, such, as, clutches, and, torque, or, current, limited, motors, in, spite, of, the, advantages, of, metal, and, plastic, wood, continued, to, be, used, for, large, gears, until, a, couple, of, centuries, ago, because, of, cost, weight, tradition, or, other, considerations, in, 1967, the, thompson, manufacturing, company, of, lancaster, new, hampshire, still, had, a, very, active, business, in, supplying, tens, of, thousands, of, maple, gear, teeth, per, year, mostly, for, use, in, paper, mills, and, grist, mills, some, dating, back, over, 100, years, the, most, common, techniques, for, gear, manufacturing, are, dies, sand, and, investment, casting, injection, molding, powder, metallurgy, blanking, and, gear, cutting, as, of, 2014, an, estimated, 80, of, all, gearing, produced, worldwide, is, produced, by, net, shape, molding, molded, gearing, is, usually, powder, metallurgy, plastic, injection, or, metal, die, casting, gears, produced, by, powder, metallurgy, often, require, a, sintering, step, after, they, are, removed, from, the, mold, cast, gears, require, gear, cutting, or, other, machining, to, shape, the, teeth, to, the, necessary, precision, the, most, common, form, of, gear, cutting, is, hobbing, but, gear, shaping, milling, and, broaching, may, be, used, instead, metal, gears, intended, for, heavy, duty, operation, such, as, in, the, transmissions, of, cars, and, trucks, the, teeth, are, heat, treated, to, make, them, hard, and, more, wear, resistant, while, leaving, the, core, soft, but, tough, for, large, gears, that, are, prone, to, warp, a, quench, press, is, used, gears, can, be, made, by, 3d, printing, however, this, alternative, is, typically, used, only, for, prototypes, or, very, limited, production, quantities, because, of, its, high, cost, low, accuracy, and, relatively, low, strength, of, the, resulting, part, besides, gear, trains, other, alternative, methods, of, transmitting, torque, between, non, coaxial, parts, include, link, chains, driven, by, sprockets, friction, drives, belts, and, pulleys, hydraulic, couplings, and, timing, belts, one, major, advantage, of, gears, is, that, their, rigid, body, and, the, snug, interlocking, of, the, teeth, ensure, precise, tracking, of, the, rotation, acros, the, gear, train, limited, only, by, backlash, and, other, mechanical, defects, for, this, reason, they, are, favored, in, precision, applications, such, as, watches, gear, trains, also, can, have, fewer, separate, parts, only, two, and, have, minimal, power, loss, minimal, wear, and, long, life, gears, are, also, often, the, most, efficient, and, compact, way, of, transmitting, torque, between, two, non, parallel, axes, on, the, other, hand, gears, are, more, expensive, to, manufacture, may, require, periodic, lubrication, and, may, have, greater, mass, and, rotational, inertia, than, the, equivalent, pulleys, more, importantly, the, distance, between, the, axes, of, matched, gears, is, limited, and, cannot, be, changed, once, they, are, manufactured, there, are, also, applications, where, slippage, under, overload, or, transients, as, occurs, with, belts, hydraulics, and, friction, wheels, is, not, only, acceptable, but, desirable, for, basic, analysis, purposes, each, gear, can, be, idealized, as, a, perfectly, rigid, body, that, in, normal, operation, turns, around, a, rotation, axis, that, is, fixed, in, space, without, sliding, along, it, thus, each, point, of, the, gear, can, move, only, along, a, circle, that, is, perpendicular, to, its, axis, and, centered, on, it, at, any, moment, t, all, points, of, the, gear, will, be, rotating, around, that, axis, with, the, same, angular, speed, t, in, the, same, sense, the, speed, need, not, be, constant, over, time, the, action, surface, of, the, gear, consists, of, all, points, of, its, surface, that, in, normal, operation, may, contact, the, matching, gear, with, positive, pressure, all, other, parts, of, the, surface, are, irrelevant, except, that, they, cannot, be, crossed, by, any, part, of, the, matching, gear, in, a, gear, with, n, teeth, the, working, surface, has, n, fold, rotational, symmetry, about, the, axis, meaning, that, it, is, congruent, with, itself, when, the, gear, rotates, by, 1, n, of, a, turn, if, the, gear, is, meant, to, transmit, or, receive, torque, with, a, definite, sense, only, clockwise, or, counterclockwise, with, respect, to, some, reference, viewpoint, the, action, surface, consists, of, n, separate, patches, the, tooth, faces, which, have, the, same, shape, and, are, positioned, in, the, same, way, relative, to, the, axis, spaced, 1, n, turn, apart, if, the, torque, on, each, gear, may, have, both, senses, the, action, surface, will, have, two, sets, of, n, tooth, faces, each, set, will, be, effective, only, while, the, torque, has, one, specific, sense, and, the, two, sets, can, be, analyzed, independently, of, the, other, however, in, this, case, the, gear, usually, has, also, flip, over, symmetry, so, that, the, two, sets, of, tooth, faces, are, congruent, after, the, gear, is, flipped, this, arrangement, ensures, that, the, two, gears, are, firmly, locked, together, at, all, times, with, no, backlash, during, operation, each, point, p, of, each, tooth, face, will, at, some, moment, contact, a, tooth, face, of, the, matching, gear, at, some, point, q, of, one, of, its, tooth, faces, at, that, moment, and, at, those, points, the, two, faces, must, have, the, same, perpendicular, direction, but, opposite, orientation, but, since, the, two, gears, are, rotating, around, different, axes, the, points, p, and, q, are, moving, along, different, circles, therefore, the, contact, cannot, last, more, than, one, instant, and, p, will, then, either, slide, across, the, other, face, or, stop, contacting, it, altogether, on, the, other, hand, at, any, given, moment, there, is, at, least, one, such, pair, of, contact, points, usually, more, than, one, even, a, whole, line, or, surface, of, contact, actual, gears, deviate, from, this, model, in, many, ways, they, are, not, perfectly, rigid, their, mounting, does, not, ensure, that, the, rotation, axis, will, be, perfectly, fixed, in, space, the, teeth, may, have, slightly, different, shapes, and, spacing, the, tooth, faces, are, not, perfectly, smooth, and, so, on, yet, these, deviations, from, the, ideal, model, can, be, ignored, for, a, basic, analysis, of, the, operation, of, a, gear, set, one, criterion, for, classifying, gears, is, the, relative, position, and, direction, of, the, axes, or, rotation, of, the, gears, that, are, to, be, meshed, together, in, the, most, common, configuration, the, axes, of, rotation, of, the, two, gears, are, parallel, and, usually, their, sizes, are, such, that, they, contact, near, a, point, between, the, two, axes, in, this, configuration, the, two, gears, turn, in, opposite, senses, occasionally, the, axes, are, parallel, but, one, gear, is, nested, inside, the, other, in, this, configuration, both, gears, turn, in, the, same, sense, if, the, two, gears, are, cut, by, an, imaginary, plane, perpendicular, to, the, axes, each, section, of, one, gear, will, interact, only, with, the, corresponding, section, of, the, other, gear, thus, the, three, dimensional, gear, train, can, be, understood, as, a, stack, of, gears, that, are, flat, and, infinitesimally, thin, that, is, essentially, two, dimensional, in, a, crossed, arrangement, the, axes, of, rotation, of, the, two, gears, are, not, parallel, but, cross, at, an, arbitrary, angle, except, zero, or, 180, degrees, for, best, operation, each, wheel, then, must, be, a, bevel, gear, whose, overall, shape, is, like, a, slice, frustum, of, a, cone, whose, apex, is, the, meeting, point, of, the, two, axes, bevel, gears, with, equal, numbers, of, teeth, and, shaft, axes, at, 90, degrees, are, called, miter, us, or, mitre, uk, gears, independently, of, the, angle, between, the, axes, the, larger, of, two, unequal, matching, bevel, gears, may, be, internal, or, external, depending, the, desired, relative, sense, of, rotation, if, the, two, gears, are, sliced, by, an, imaginary, sphere, whose, center, is, the, point, where, the, two, axes, cross, each, section, will, remain, on, the, surface, of, that, sphere, as, the, gear, rotates, and, the, section, of, one, gear, will, interact, only, with, the, corresponding, section, of, the, other, gear, in, this, way, a, pair, of, meshed, 3d, gears, can, be, understood, as, a, stack, of, nested, infinitely, thin, cup, like, gears, the, gears, in, a, matching, pair, are, said, to, be, skew, if, their, axes, of, rotation, are, skew, lines, neither, parallel, nor, intersecting, in, this, case, the, best, shape, for, each, pitch, surface, is, neither, cylindrical, nor, conical, but, a, portion, of, a, hyperboloid, of, revolution, such, gears, are, called, hypoid, for, short, hypoid, gears, are, most, commonly, found, with, shafts, at, 90, degrees, contact, between, hypoid, gear, teeth, may, be, even, smoother, and, more, gradual, than, with, spiral, bevel, gear, teeth, but, also, have, a, sliding, action, along, the, meshing, teeth, as, it, rotates, and, therefore, usually, require, some, of, the, most, viscous, types, of, gear, oil, to, avoid, it, being, extruded, from, the, mating, tooth, faces, the, oil, is, normally, designated, hp, for, hypoid, followed, by, a, number, denoting, the, viscosity, also, the, pinion, can, be, designed, with, fewer, teeth, than, a, spiral, bevel, pinion, with, the, result, that, gear, ratios, of, 60, 1, and, higher, are, feasible, using, a, single, set, of, hypoid, gears, this, style, of, gear, is, most, common, in, motor, vehicle, drive, trains, in, concert, with, a, differential, whereas, a, regular, nonhypoid, ring, and, pinion, gear, set, is, suitable, for, many, applications, it, is, not, ideal, for, vehicle, drive, trains, because, it, generates, more, noise, and, vibration, than, a, hypoid, does, bringing, hypoid, gears, to, market, for, mass, production, applications, was, an, engineering, improvement, of, the, 1920s, a, gear, is, said, to, be, external, if, its, teeth, are, directed, generally, away, from, the, rotation, axis, and, internal, otherwise, in, a, pair, of, matching, wheels, only, one, of, them, the, larger, one, may, be, internal, a, crown, gear, or, contrate, gear, is, one, whose, teeth, project, at, right, angles, to, the, plane, a, crown, gear, is, also, sometimes, meshed, with, an, escapement, such, as, found, in, mechanical, clocks, gear, teeth, typically, extend, across, the, whole, thickness, of, the, gear, another, criterion, for, classifying, gears, is, the, general, direction, of, the, teeth, across, that, dimension, this, attribute, is, affected, by, the, relative, position, and, direction, of, the, axes, or, rotation, of, the, gears, that, are, to, be, meshed, together, in, a, cylindrical, spur, gear, or, straight, cut, gear, the, tooth, faces, are, straight, along, the, direction, parallel, to, the, axis, of, rotation, any, imaginary, cylinder, with, the, same, axis, will, cut, the, teeth, along, parallel, straight, lines, the, teeth, can, be, either, internal, or, external, two, spur, gears, mesh, together, correctly, only, if, fitted, to, parallel, shafts, no, axial, thrust, is, created, by, the, tooth, loads, spur, gears, are, excellent, at, moderate, speeds, but, tend, to, be, noisy, at, high, speeds, for, arrangements, with, crossed, non, parallel, axes, the, faces, in, a, straight, cut, gear, are, parts, of, a, general, conical, surface, whose, generating, lines, generatrices, go, through, the, meeting, point, of, the, two, axes, resulting, in, a, bevel, gear, such, gears, are, generally, used, only, at, speeds, below, 5, m, s, 1000, ft, min, or, for, small, gears, 1000, r, p, m, in, a, helical, or, dry, fixed, gear, the, tooth, walls, are, not, parallel, to, the, axis, of, rotation, but, are, set, at, an, angle, an, imaginary, pitch, surface, cylinder, cone, or, hyperboloid, depending, on, the, relative, axis, positions, intersects, each, tooth, face, along, an, arc, of, an, helix, helical, gears, can, be, meshed, in, parallel, or, orientations, the, former, refers, to, when, the, shafts, are, parallel, to, each, other, this, is, the, most, common, orientation, in, the, latter, the, shafts, are, non, parallel, and, in, this, configuration, the, gears, are, sometimes, known, as, skew, gears, the, angled, teeth, engage, more, gradually, than, do, spur, gear, teeth, causing, them, to, run, more, smoothly, and, quietly, with, parallel, helical, gears, each, pair, of, teeth, first, make, contact, at, a, single, point, at, one, side, of, the, gear, wheel, a, moving, curve, of, contact, then, grows, gradually, across, the, tooth, face, to, a, maximum, then, recedes, until, the, teeth, break, contact, at, a, single, point, on, the, opposite, side, in, spur, gears, teeth, suddenly, meet, at, a, line, contact, across, their, entire, width, causing, stress, and, noise, spur, gears, make, a, characteristic, whine, at, high, speeds, for, this, reason, spur, gears, are, used, in, low, speed, applications, and, in, situations, where, noise, control, is, not, a, problem, and, helical, gears, are, used, in, high, speed, applications, large, power, transmission, or, where, noise, abatement, is, important, the, speed, is, considered, high, when, the, pitch, line, velocity, exceeds, 25, m, s, a, disadvantage, of, helical, gears, is, a, resultant, thrust, along, the, axis, of, the, gear, which, must, be, accommodated, by, appropriate, thrust, bearings, however, this, issue, can, be, circumvented, by, using, a, herringbone, gear, or, double, helical, gear, which, has, no, axial, thrust, and, also, provides, self, aligning, of, the, gears, this, results, in, less, axial, thrust, than, a, comparable, spur, gear, a, second, disadvantage, of, helical, gears, is, also, a, greater, degree, of, sliding, friction, between, the, meshing, teeth, often, addressed, with, additives, in, the, lubricant, for, a, crossed, or, skew, configuration, the, gears, must, have, the, same, pressure, angle, and, normal, pitch, however, the, helix, angle, and, handedness, can, be, different, the, relationship, between, the, two, shafts, is, actually, defined, by, the, helix, angle, s, of, the, two, shafts, and, the, handedness, as, defined, where, displaystyle, beta, is, the, helix, angle, for, the, gear, the, crossed, configuration, is, less, mechanically, sound, because, there, is, only, a, point, contact, between, the, gears, whereas, in, the, parallel, configuration, there, is, a, line, contact, quite, commonly, helical, gears, are, used, with, the, helix, angle, of, one, having, the, negative, of, the, helix, angle, of, the, other, such, a, pair, might, also, be, referred, to, as, having, a, right, handed, helix, and, a, left, handed, helix, of, equal, angles, the, two, equal, but, opposite, angles, add, to, zero, the, angle, between, shafts, is, zero, that, is, the, shafts, are, parallel, where, the, sum, or, the, difference, as, described, in, the, equations, above, is, not, zero, the, shafts, are, crossed, for, shafts, crossed, at, right, angles, the, helix, angles, are, of, the, same, hand, because, they, must, add, to, 90, degrees, this, is, the, case, with, the, gears, in, the, illustration, above, they, mesh, correctly, in, the, crossed, configuration, for, the, parallel, configuration, one, of, the, helix, angles, should, be, reversed, the, gears, illustrated, cannot, mesh, with, the, shafts, parallel, double, helical, gears, overcome, the, problem, of, axial, thrust, presented, by, single, helical, gears, by, using, a, double, set, of, teeth, slanted, in, opposite, directions, a, double, helical, gear, can, be, thought, of, as, two, mirrored, helical, gears, mounted, closely, together, on, a, common, axle, this, arrangement, cancels, out, the, net, axial, thrust, since, each, half, of, the, gear, thrusts, in, the, opposite, direction, resulting, in, a, net, axial, force, of, zero, this, arrangement, can, also, remove, the, need, for, thrust, bearings, however, double, helical, gears, are, more, difficult, to, manufacture, due, to, their, more, complicated, shape, herringbone, gears, are, a, special, type, of, helical, gears, they, do, not, have, a, groove, in, the, middle, like, some, other, double, helical, gears, do, the, two, mirrored, helical, gears, are, joined, so, that, their, teeth, form, a, v, shape, this, can, also, be, applied, to, bevel, gears, as, in, the, final, drive, of, the, citro, n, type, a, another, type, of, double, helical, gear, is, a, w, st, gear, for, both, possible, rotational, directions, there, exist, two, possible, arrangements, for, the, oppositely, oriented, helical, gears, or, gear, faces, one, arrangement, is, called, stable, and, the, other, unstable, in, a, stable, arrangement, the, helical, gear, faces, are, oriented, so, that, each, axial, force, is, directed, toward, the, center, of, the, gear, in, an, unstable, arrangement, both, axial, forces, are, directed, away, from, the, center, of, the, gear, in, either, arrangement, the, total, or, net, axial, force, on, each, gear, is, zero, when, the, gears, are, aligned, correctly, if, the, gears, become, misaligned, in, the, axial, direction, the, unstable, arrangement, generates, a, net, force, that, may, lead, to, disassembly, of, the, gear, train, while, the, stable, arrangement, generates, a, net, corrective, force, if, the, direction, of, rotation, is, reversed, the, direction, of, the, axial, thrusts, is, also, reversed, so, a, stable, configuration, becomes, unstable, and, vice, versa, stable, double, helical, gears, can, be, directly, interchanged, with, spur, gears, without, any, need, for, different, bearings, worms, resemble, screws, a, worm, is, meshed, with, a, worm, wheel, which, looks, similar, to, a, spur, gear, worm, and, gear, sets, are, a, simple, and, compact, way, to, achieve, a, high, torque, low, speed, gear, ratio, for, example, helical, gears, are, normally, limited, to, gear, ratios, of, less, than, 10, 1, while, worm, and, gear, sets, vary, from, 10, 1, to, 500, 1, a, disadvantage, is, the, potential, for, considerable, sliding, action, leading, to, low, efficiency, a, worm, gear, is, a, species, of, helical, gear, but, its, helix, angle, is, usually, somewhat, large, close, to, 90, degrees, and, its, body, is, usually, fairly, long, in, the, axial, direction, these, attributes, give, it, screw, like, qualities, the, distinction, between, a, worm, and, a, helical, gear, is, that, at, least, one, tooth, persists, for, a, full, rotation, around, the, helix, if, this, occurs, it, is, a, worm, if, not, it, is, a, helical, gear, a, worm, may, have, as, few, as, one, tooth, if, that, tooth, persists, for, several, turns, around, the, helix, the, worm, appears, superficially, to, have, more, than, one, tooth, but, what, one, in, fact, sees, is, the, same, tooth, reappearing, at, intervals, along, the, length, of, the, worm, the, usual, screw, nomenclature, applies, a, one, toothed, worm, is, called, single, thread, or, single, start, a, worm, with, more, than, one, tooth, is, called, multiple, thread, or, multiple, start, the, helix, angle, of, a, worm, is, not, usually, specified, instead, the, lead, angle, which, is, equal, to, 90, degrees, minus, the, helix, angle, is, given, in, a, worm, and, gear, set, the, worm, can, always, drive, the, gear, however, if, the, gear, attempts, to, drive, the, worm, it, may, or, may, not, succeed, particularly, if, the, lead, angle, is, small, the, gear, s, teeth, may, simply, lock, against, the, worm, s, teeth, because, the, force, component, circumferential, to, the, worm, is, not, sufficient, to, overcome, friction, in, traditional, music, boxes, however, the, gear, drives, the, worm, which, has, a, large, helix, angle, this, mesh, drives, the, speed, limiter, vanes, which, are, mounted, on, the, worm, shaft, worm, and, gear, sets, that, do, lock, are, called, self, locking, which, can, be, used, to, advantage, as, when, it, is, desired, to, set, the, position, of, a, mechanism, by, turning, the, worm, and, then, have, the, mechanism, hold, that, position, an, example, is, the, machine, head, found, on, some, types, of, stringed, instruments, if, the, gear, in, a, worm, and, gear, set, is, an, ordinary, helical, gear, only, a, single, point, of, contact, is, achieved, if, medium, to, high, power, transmission, is, desired, the, tooth, shape, of, the, gear, is, modified, to, achieve, more, intimate, contact, by, making, both, gears, partially, envelop, each, other, this, is, done, by, making, both, concave, and, joining, them, at, a, saddle, point, this, is, called, a, cone, drive, or, double, enveloping, worm, gears, can, be, right, or, left, handed, following, the, long, established, practice, for, screw, threads, another, criterion, to, classify, gears, is, the, tooth, profile, the, shape, of, the, cross, section, of, a, tooth, face, by, an, imaginary, cut, perpendicular, to, the, pitch, surface, such, as, the, transverse, normal, or, axial, plane, the, tooth, profile, is, crucial, for, the, smoothness, and, uniformity, of, the, movement, of, matching, gears, as, well, as, for, the, friction, and, wear, the, teeth, of, antique, or, artisanal, gears, that, were, cut, by, hand, from, sheet, material, like, those, in, the, antikhytera, mechanism, generally, had, simple, profiles, such, as, triangles, the, teeth, of, larger, gears, such, as, used, in, windmills, were, usually, pegs, with, simple, shapes, like, cylinders, parallelepipeds, or, triangular, prisms, inserted, into, a, smooth, wooden, or, metal, wheel, or, were, holes, with, equally, simple, shapes, cut, into, such, a, wheel, because, of, their, sub, optimal, profile, the, effective, gear, ratio, of, such, artisanal, matching, gears, was, not, constant, but, fluctuated, over, each, tooth, cycle, resulting, in, vibrations, noise, and, accelerated, wear, a, cage, gear, also, called, a, lantern, gear, or, lantern, pinion, is, one, of, those, artisanal, has, cylindrical, rods, for, teeth, parallel, to, the, axle, and, arranged, in, a, circle, around, it, much, as, the, bars, on, a, round, bird, cage, or, lantern, the, assembly, is, held, together, by, disks, at, each, end, into, which, the, tooth, rods, and, axle, are, set, cage, gears, are, more, efficient, than, solid, pinions, and, dirt, can, fall, through, the, rods, rather, than, becoming, trapped, and, increasing, wear, they, can, be, constructed, with, very, simple, tools, as, the, teeth, are, not, formed, by, cutting, or, milling, but, rather, by, drilling, holes, and, inserting, rods, sometimes, used, in, clocks, a, cage, gear, should, always, be, driven, by, a, gearwheel, not, used, as, the, driver, the, cage, gear, was, not, initially, favoured, by, conservative, clock, makers, it, became, popular, in, turret, clocks, where, dirty, working, conditions, were, most, commonplace, domestic, american, clock, movements, often, used, them, in, most, modern, gears, the, tooth, profile, is, usually, not, straight, or, circular, but, of, special, form, designed, to, achieve, a, constant, angular, velocity, ratio, there, is, an, infinite, variety, of, tooth, profiles, that, will, achieve, this, goal, in, fact, given, a, fairly, arbitrary, tooth, shape, it, is, possible, to, develop, a, tooth, profile, for, the, mating, gear, that, will, do, it, however, two, constant, velocity, tooth, profiles, are, the, most, commonly, used, in, modern, times, for, gears, with, parallel, or, crossed, axes, based, on, the, cycloid, and, involute, curves, cycloidal, gears, were, more, common, until, the, late, 1800s, since, then, the, involute, has, largely, superseded, it, particularly, in, drive, train, applications, the, cycloid, is, in, some, ways, the, more, interesting, and, flexible, shape, however, the, involute, has, two, advantages, it, is, easier, to, manufacture, and, it, permits, the, center, to, center, spacing, of, the, gears, to, vary, over, some, range, without, ruining, the, constancy, of, the, velocity, ratio, cycloidal, gears, only, work, properly, if, the, center, spacing, is, exactly, right, cycloidal, gears, are, still, commonly, used, in, mechanical, clocks, for, non, parallel, axes, with, non, straight, tooth, cuts, the, best, tooth, profile, is, one, of, several, spiral, bevel, gear, shapes, these, include, gleason, types, circular, arc, with, non, constant, tooth, depth, oerlikon, and, curvex, types, circular, arc, with, constant, tooth, depth, klingelnberg, cyclo, palloid, epicycloid, with, constant, tooth, depth, or, klingelnberg, palloid, the, tooth, faces, in, these, gear, types, are, not, involute, cylinders, or, cones, but, patches, of, octoidal, surfaces, manufacturing, such, tooth, faces, may, require, a, 5, axis, milling, machine, spiral, bevel, gears, have, the, same, advantages, and, disadvantages, relative, to, their, straight, cut, cousins, as, helical, gears, do, to, spur, gears, such, as, lower, noise, and, vibration, simplified, calculated, bevel, gears, on, the, basis, of, an, equivalent, cylindrical, gear, in, normal, section, with, an, involute, tooth, form, show, a, deviant, tooth, form, with, reduced, tooth, strength, by, 10, 28, without, offset, and, 45, with, offset, a, rack, is, a, toothed, bar, or, rod, that, can, be, thought, of, as, a, sector, gear, with, an, infinitely, large, radius, of, curvature, torque, can, be, converted, to, linear, force, by, meshing, a, rack, with, a, round, gear, called, a, pinion, the, pinion, turns, while, the, rack, moves, in, a, straight, line, such, a, mechanism, is, used, in, the, steering, of, automobiles, to, convert, the, rotation, of, the, steering, wheel, into, the, left, to, right, motion, of, the, tie, rod, s, that, are, attached, to, the, front, wheels, racks, also, feature, in, the, theory, of, gear, geometry, where, for, instance, the, tooth, shape, of, an, interchangeable, set, of, gears, may, be, specified, for, the, rack, infinite, radius, and, the, tooth, shapes, for, gears, of, particular, actual, radii, are, then, derived, from, that, the, rack, and, pinion, gear, type, is, also, used, in, a, rack, railway, in, epicyclic, gearing, one, or, more, of, the, gear, axes, moves, examples, are, sun, and, planet, gearing, see, below, cycloidal, drive, automatic, transmissions, and, mechanical, differentials, sun, and, planet, gearing, is, a, method, of, converting, reciprocating, motion, into, rotary, motion, that, was, used, in, steam, engines, james, watt, used, it, on, his, early, steam, engines, to, get, around, the, patent, on, the, crank, but, it, also, provided, the, advantage, of, increasing, the, flywheel, speed, so, watt, could, use, a, lighter, flywheel, in, the, illustration, the, sun, is, yellow, the, planet, red, the, reciprocating, arm, is, blue, the, flywheel, is, green, and, the, driveshaft, is, gray, non, circular, gears, are, designed, for, special, purposes, while, a, regular, gear, is, optimized, to, transmit, torque, to, another, engaged, member, with, minimum, noise, and, wear, and, maximum, efficiency, a, non, circular, gear, s, main, objective, might, be, ratio, variations, axle, displacement, oscillations, and, more, common, applications, include, textile, machines, potentiometers, and, continuously, variable, transmissions, most, gears, are, ideally, rigid, bodies, which, transmit, torque, and, movement, through, the, lever, principle, and, contact, forces, between, the, teeth, namely, the, torque, applied, to, one, gear, causes, it, to, rotate, as, rigid, body, so, that, its, teeth, push, against, those, of, the, matched, gear, which, in, turn, rotates, as, a, rigid, body, transmitting, the, torque, to, its, axle, some, specialized, gear, escape, this, pattern, however, a, harmonic, gear, or, strain, wave, gear, is, a, specialized, gearing, mechanism, often, used, in, industrial, motion, control, robotics, and, aerospace, for, its, advantages, over, traditional, gearing, systems, including, lack, of, backlash, compactness, and, high, gear, ratios, though, the, diagram, does, not, demonstrate, the, correct, configuration, it, is, a, timing, gear, conventionally, with, far, more, teeth, than, a, traditional, gear, to, ensure, a, higher, degree, of, precision, in, a, magnetic, gear, pair, there, is, no, contact, between, the, two, members, the, torque, is, instead, transmitted, through, magnetic, fields, the, cogs, of, each, gear, are, constant, magnets, with, periodic, alternation, of, opposite, magnetic, poles, on, mating, surfaces, gear, components, are, mounted, with, a, backlash, capability, similar, to, other, mechanical, gearings, although, they, cannot, exert, as, much, force, as, a, traditional, gear, due, to, limits, on, magnetic, field, strength, such, gears, work, without, touching, and, so, are, immune, to, wear, have, very, low, noise, minimal, power, losses, from, friction, and, can, slip, without, damage, making, them, very, reliable, they, can, be, used, in, configurations, that, are, not, possible, for, gears, that, must, be, physically, touching, and, can, operate, with, a, non, metallic, barrier, completely, separating, the, driving, force, from, the, load, the, magnetic, coupling, can, transmit, force, into, a, hermetically, sealed, enclosure, without, using, a, radial, shaft, seal, which, may, leak, several, other, helix, parameters, can, be, viewed, either, in, the, normal, or, transverse, planes, the, subscript, n, usually, indicates, the, normal, subscript, w, denotes, the, worm, subscript, g, denotes, the, gear, pitch, is, the, distance, between, a, point, on, one, tooth, and, the, corresponding, point, on, an, adjacent, tooth, it, is, a, dimension, measured, along, a, line, or, curve, in, the, transverse, normal, or, axial, directions, the, use, of, the, single, word, pitch, without, qualification, may, be, ambiguous, and, for, this, reason, it, is, preferable, to, use, specific, designations, such, as, transverse, circular, pitch, normal, base, pitch, axial, pitch, backlash, is, the, error, in, motion, that, occurs, when, gears, change, direction, it, exists, because, there, is, always, some, gap, between, the, trailing, face, of, the, driving, tooth, and, the, leading, face, of, the, tooth, behind, it, on, the, driven, gear, and, that, gap, must, be, closed, before, force, can, be, transferred, in, the, new, direction, the, term, backlash, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, the, size, of, the, gap, not, just, the, phenomenon, it, causes, thus, one, could, speak, of, a, pair, of, gears, as, having, for, example, 0, 1, mm, of, backlash, a, pair, of, gears, could, be, designed, to, have, zero, backlash, but, this, would, presuppose, perfection, in, manufacturing, uniform, thermal, expansion, characteristics, throughout, the, system, and, no, lubricant, therefore, gear, pairs, are, designed, to, have, some, backlash, it, is, usually, provided, by, reducing, the, tooth, thickness, of, each, gear, by, half, the, desired, gap, distance, in, the, case, of, a, large, gear, and, a, small, pinion, however, the, backlash, is, usually, taken, entirely, off, the, gear, and, the, pinion, is, given, full, sized, teeth, backlash, can, also, be, provided, by, moving, the, gears, further, apart, the, backlash, of, a, gear, train, equals, the, sum, of, the, backlash, of, each, pair, of, gears, so, in, long, trains, backlash, can, become, a, problem, for, situations, that, require, precision, such, as, instrumentation, and, control, backlash, can, be, minimized, through, one, of, several, techniques, for, instance, the, gear, can, be, split, along, a, plane, perpendicular, to, the, axis, one, half, fixed, to, the, shaft, in, the, usual, manner, the, other, half, placed, alongside, it, free, to, rotate, about, the, shaft, but, with, springs, between, the, two, halves, providing, relative, torque, between, them, so, that, one, achieves, in, effect, a, single, gear, with, expanding, teeth, another, method, involves, tapering, the, teeth, in, the, axial, direction, and, letting, the, gear, slide, in, the, axial, direction, to, take, up, slack, although, gears, can, be, made, with, any, pitch, for, convenience, and, interchangeability, standard, pitches, are, frequently, used, pitch, is, a, property, associated, with, linear, dimensions, and, so, differs, whether, the, standard, values, are, in, the, imperial, inch, or, metric, systems, using, inch, measurements, standard, diametral, pitch, values, with, units, of, per, inch, are, chosen, the, diametrical, pitch, is, the, number, of, teeth, on, a, gear, of, one, inch, pitch, diameter, common, standard, values, for, spur, gears, are, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72, 80, 96, 100, 120, and, 200, certain, standard, pitches, such, as, 1, 10, and, 1, 20, in, inch, measurements, which, mesh, with, linear, rack, are, actually, linear, circular, pitch, values, with, units, of, inches, when, gear, dimensions, are, in, the, metric, system, the, pitch, specification, is, generally, in, terms, of, module, or, modulus, which, is, effectively, a, length, measurement, across, the, pitch, diameter, the, term, module, is, understood, to, mean, the, pitch, diameter, in, millimetres, divided, by, the, number, of, teeth, when, the, module, is, based, upon, inch, measurements, it, is, known, as, the, english, module, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, metric, module, module, is, a, direct, dimension, millimeters, per, tooth, unlike, diametrical, pitch, which, is, an, inverse, dimension, teeth, per, inch, thus, if, the, pitch, diameter, of, a, gear, is, 40, mm, and, the, number, of, teeth, 20, the, module, is, 2, which, means, that, there, are, 2, mm, of, pitch, diameter, for, each, tooth, the, preferred, standard, module, values, are, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 8, 1, 0, 1, 25, 1, 5, 2, 0, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, and, 50, modern, physics, adopted, the, gear, model, in, different, ways, in, the, nineteenth, century, james, clerk, maxwell, developed, a, model, of, electromagnetism, in, which, magnetic, field, lines, were, rotating, tubes, of, incompressible, fluid, maxwell, used, a, gear, wheel, and, called, it, an, idle, wheel, to, explain, the, electric, current, as, a, rotation, of, particles, in, opposite, directions, to, that, of, the, rotating, field, lines, more, recently, quantum, physics, uses, quantum, gears, in, their, model, a, group, of, gears, can, serve, as, a, model, for, several, different, systems, such, as, an, artificially, constructed, nanomechanical, device, or, a, group, of, ring, molecules, the, three, wave, hypothesis, compares, the, wave, particle, duality, to, a, bevel, gear, the, gear, mechanism, was, previously, considered, exclusively, artificial, but, as, early, as, 1957, gears, had, been, recognized, in, the, hind, legs, of, various, species, of, planthoppers, and, scientists, from, the, university, of, cambridge, characterized, their, functional, significance, in, 2013, by, doing, high, speed, photography, of, the, nymphs, of, issus, coleoptratus, at, cambridge, university, these, gears, are, found, only, in, the, nymph, forms, of, all, planthoppers, and, are, lost, during, the, final, molt, to, the, adult, stage, in, i, coleoptratus, each, leg, has, a, 400, micrometer, strip, of, teeth, pitch, radius, 200, micrometers, with, 10, to, 12, fully, interlocking, spur, type, gear, teeth, including, filleted, curves, at, the, base, of, each, tooth, to, reduce, the, risk, of, shearing, the, joint, rotates, like, mechanical, gears, and, synchronizes, issus, s, hind, legs, when, it, jumps, to, within, 30, microseconds, preventing, yaw, rotation, the, gears, are, not, connected, all, the, time, one, is, located, on, each, of, the, juvenile, insect, s, hind, legs, and, when, it, prepares, to, jump, the, two, sets, of, teeth, lock, together, as, a, result, the, legs, move, in, almost, perfect, unison, giving, the, insect, more, power, as, the, gears, rotate, to, their, stopping, point, and, then, unlock, bibliography
