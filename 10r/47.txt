in, computer, science, data, treated, as, singular, plural, or, as, a, mass, noun, is, any, sequence, of, one, or, more, symbols, datum, is, a, single, symbol, of, data, data, requires, interpretation, to, become, information, digital, data, is, data, that, is, represented, using, the, binary, number, system, of, ones, 1, and, zeros, 0, instead, of, analog, representation, in, modern, post, 1960, computer, systems, all, data, is, digital, data, exists, in, three, states, data, at, rest, data, in, transit, and, data, in, use, data, within, a, computer, in, most, cases, moves, as, parallel, data, data, moving, to, or, from, a, computer, in, most, cases, moves, as, serial, data, data, sourced, from, an, analog, device, such, as, a, temperature, sensor, may, be, converted, to, digital, using, an, analog, to, digital, converter, data, representing, quantities, characters, or, symbols, on, which, operations, are, performed, by, a, computer, are, stored, and, recorded, on, magnetic, optical, electronic, or, mechanical, recording, media, and, transmitted, in, the, form, of, digital, electrical, or, optical, signals, data, pass, in, and, out, of, computers, via, peripheral, devices, physical, computer, memory, elements, consist, of, an, address, and, a, byte, word, of, data, storage, digital, data, are, often, stored, in, relational, databases, like, tables, or, sql, databases, and, can, generally, be, represented, as, abstract, key, value, pairs, data, can, be, organized, in, many, different, types, of, data, structures, including, arrays, graphs, and, objects, data, structures, can, store, data, of, many, different, types, including, numbers, strings, and, even, other, data, structures, metadata, helps, translate, data, to, information, metadata, is, data, about, the, data, metadata, may, be, implied, specified, or, given, data, relating, to, physical, events, or, processes, will, have, a, temporal, component, this, temporal, component, may, be, implied, this, is, the, case, when, a, device, such, as, a, temperature, logger, receives, data, from, a, temperature, sensor, when, the, temperature, is, received, it, is, assumed, that, the, data, has, a, temporal, reference, of, now, so, the, device, records, the, date, time, and, temperature, together, when, the, data, logger, communicates, temperatures, it, must, also, report, the, date, and, time, as, metadata, for, each, temperature, reading, fundamentally, computers, follow, a, sequence, of, instructions, they, are, given, in, the, form, of, data, a, set, of, instructions, to, perform, a, given, task, or, tasks, is, called, a, program, a, program, is, data, in, the, form, of, coded, instructions, to, control, the, operation, of, a, computer, or, other, machine, in, the, nominal, case, the, program, as, executed, by, the, computer, will, consist, of, machine, code, the, elements, of, storage, manipulated, by, the, program, but, not, actually, executed, by, the, central, processing, unit, cpu, are, also, data, at, its, most, essential, a, single, datum, is, a, value, stored, at, a, specific, location, therefore, it, is, possible, for, computer, programs, to, operate, on, other, computer, programs, by, manipulating, their, programmatic, data, to, store, data, bytes, in, a, file, they, have, to, be, serialized, in, a, file, format, typically, programs, are, stored, in, special, file, types, different, from, those, used, for, other, data, executable, files, contain, programs, all, other, files, are, also, data, files, however, executable, files, may, also, contain, data, used, by, the, program, which, is, built, into, the, program, in, particular, some, executable, files, have, a, data, segment, which, nominally, contains, constants, and, initial, values, for, variables, both, of, which, can, be, considered, data, the, line, between, program, and, data, can, become, blurry, an, interpreter, for, example, is, a, program, the, input, data, to, an, interpreter, is, itself, a, program, just, not, one, expressed, in, native, machine, language, in, many, cases, the, interpreted, program, will, be, a, human, readable, text, file, which, is, manipulated, with, a, text, editor, program, metaprogramming, similarly, involves, programs, manipulating, other, programs, as, data, programs, like, compilers, linkers, debuggers, program, updaters, virus, scanners, and, such, use, other, programs, as, their, data, for, example, a, user, might, first, instruct, the, operating, system, to, load, a, word, processor, program, from, one, file, and, then, use, the, running, program, to, open, and, edit, a, document, stored, in, another, file, in, this, example, the, document, would, be, considered, data, if, the, word, processor, also, features, a, spell, checker, then, the, dictionary, word, list, for, the, spell, checker, would, also, be, considered, data, the, algorithms, used, by, the, spell, checker, to, suggest, corrections, would, be, either, machine, code, data, or, text, in, some, interpretable, programming, language, in, an, alternate, usage, binary, files, which, are, not, human, readable, are, sometimes, called, data, as, distinguished, from, human, readable, text, the, total, amount, of, digital, data, in, 2007, was, estimated, to, be, 281, billion, gigabytes, 281, exabytes, keys, in, data, provide, the, context, for, values, regardless, of, the, structure, of, data, there, is, always, a, key, component, present, keys, in, data, and, data, structures, are, essential, for, giving, meaning, to, data, values, without, a, key, that, is, directly, or, indirectly, associated, with, a, value, or, collection, of, values, in, a, structure, the, values, become, meaningless, and, cease, to, be, data, that, is, to, say, there, has, to, be, a, key, component, linked, to, a, value, component, in, order, for, it, to, be, considered, data, data, can, be, represented, in, computers, in, multiple, ways, as, per, the, following, examples, it, is, only, after, instantiation, that, an, object, of, a, specified, class, exists, after, an, object, s, reference, is, cleared, the, object, also, ceases, to, exist, the, memory, locations, where, the, object, s, data, was, stored, are, garbage, and, are, reclassified, as, unused, memory, available, for, reuse
