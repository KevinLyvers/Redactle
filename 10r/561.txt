a, pendulum, is, a, device, made, of, a, weight, suspended, from, a, pivot, so, that, it, can, swing, freely, when, a, pendulum, is, displaced, sideways, from, its, resting, equilibrium, position, it, is, subject, to, a, restoring, force, due, to, gravity, that, will, accelerate, it, back, toward, the, equilibrium, position, when, released, the, restoring, force, acting, on, the, pendulum, s, mass, causes, it, to, oscillate, about, the, equilibrium, position, swinging, back, and, forth, the, time, for, one, complete, cycle, a, left, swing, and, a, right, swing, is, called, the, period, the, period, depends, on, the, length, of, the, pendulum, and, also, to, a, slight, degree, on, the, amplitude, the, width, of, the, pendulum, s, swing, the, regular, motion, of, pendulums, was, used, for, timekeeping, and, was, the, world, s, most, accurate, timekeeping, technology, until, the, 1930s, the, pendulum, clock, invented, by, christiaan, huygens, in, 1656, became, the, world, s, standard, timekeeper, used, in, homes, and, offices, for, 270, years, and, achieved, accuracy, of, about, one, second, per, year, before, it, was, superseded, as, a, time, standard, by, the, quartz, clock, in, the, 1930s, pendulums, are, also, used, in, scientific, instruments, such, as, accelerometers, and, seismometers, historically, they, were, used, as, gravimeters, to, measure, the, acceleration, of, gravity, in, geo, physical, surveys, and, even, as, a, standard, of, length, the, word, pendulum, is, neo, latin, from, the, latin, pendulus, meaning, hanging, in, physics, and, mathematics, in, the, area, of, dynamical, systems, a, double, pendulum, also, known, as, a, chaotic, pendulum, is, a, pendulum, with, another, pendulum, attached, to, its, end, forming, a, simple, physical, system, that, exhibits, rich, dynamic, behavior, with, a, strong, sensitivity, to, initial, conditions, the, motion, of, a, double, pendulum, is, governed, by, a, set, of, coupled, ordinary, differential, equations, and, is, chaotic, the, simple, gravity, pendulum, is, an, idealized, mathematical, model, of, a, pendulum, this, is, a, weight, or, bob, on, the, end, of, a, massless, cord, suspended, from, a, pivot, without, friction, when, given, an, initial, push, it, will, swing, back, and, forth, at, a, constant, amplitude, real, pendulums, are, subject, to, friction, and, air, drag, so, the, amplitude, of, their, swings, declines, the, period, of, swing, of, a, simple, gravity, pendulum, depends, on, its, length, the, local, strength, of, gravity, and, to, a, small, extent, on, the, maximum, angle, that, the, pendulum, swings, away, from, vertical, 0, called, the, amplitude, it, is, independent, of, the, mass, of, the, bob, if, the, amplitude, is, limited, to, small, swings, the, period, t, of, a, simple, pendulum, the, time, taken, for, a, complete, cycle, is, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, length, of, the, pendulum, and, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, local, acceleration, of, gravity, for, small, swings, the, period, of, swing, is, approximately, the, same, for, different, size, swings, that, is, the, period, is, independent, of, amplitude, this, property, called, isochronism, is, the, reason, pendulums, are, so, useful, for, timekeeping, successive, swings, of, the, pendulum, even, if, changing, in, amplitude, take, the, same, amount, of, time, for, larger, amplitudes, the, period, increases, gradually, with, amplitude, so, it, is, longer, than, given, by, equation, 1, for, example, at, an, amplitude, of, 0, 0, 4, radians, 23, it, is, 1, larger, than, given, by, 1, the, period, increases, asymptotically, to, infinity, as, 0, approaches, radians, 180, because, the, value, 0, is, an, unstable, equilibrium, point, for, the, pendulum, the, true, period, of, an, ideal, simple, gravity, pendulum, can, be, written, in, several, different, forms, see, pendulum, mechanics, one, example, being, the, infinite, series, t, 2, l, g, n, 0, 2, n, 2, 2, n, n, 2, 2, sin, 2, n, 0, 2, 2, l, g, 1, 1, 16, 0, 2, 11, 3072, 0, 4, displaystyle, t, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, l, g, left, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, l, g, left, 1, frac, 1, 16, theta, 0, 2, frac, 11, 3072, theta, 0, 4, cdots, right, where, 0, displaystyle, theta, 0, is, in, radians, the, difference, between, this, true, period, and, the, period, for, small, swings, 1, above, is, called, the, circular, error, in, the, case, of, a, typical, grandfather, clock, whose, pendulum, has, a, swing, of, 6, and, thus, an, amplitude, of, 3, 0, 05, radians, the, difference, between, the, true, period, and, the, small, angle, approximation, 1, amounts, to, about, 15, seconds, per, day, for, small, swings, the, pendulum, approximates, a, harmonic, oscillator, and, its, motion, as, a, function, of, time, t, is, approximately, simple, harmonic, motion, t, 0, cos, 2, t, t, displaystyle, theta, t, theta, 0, cos, left, frac, 2, pi, t, t, varphi, right, where, displaystyle, varphi, is, a, constant, value, dependent, on, initial, conditions, for, real, pendulums, the, period, varies, slightly, with, factors, such, as, the, buoyancy, and, viscous, resistance, of, the, air, the, mass, of, the, string, or, rod, the, size, and, shape, of, the, bob, and, how, it, is, attached, to, the, string, and, flexibility, and, stretching, of, the, string, in, precision, applications, corrections, for, these, factors, may, need, to, be, applied, to, eq, 1, to, give, the, period, accurately, a, damped, driven, pendulum, is, a, chaotic, system, any, swinging, rigid, body, free, to, rotate, about, a, fixed, horizontal, axis, is, called, a, compound, pendulum, or, physical, pendulum, a, compound, pendulum, has, the, same, period, as, a, simple, gravity, pendulum, of, length, e, q, displaystyle, ell, mathrm, eq, called, the, equivalent, length, or, radius, of, oscillation, equal, to, the, distance, from, the, pivot, to, a, point, called, the, center, of, oscillation, this, point, is, located, under, the, center, of, mass, of, the, pendulum, at, a, distance, which, depends, on, the, mass, distribution, of, the, pendulum, if, most, of, the, mass, is, concentrated, in, a, relatively, small, bob, compared, to, the, pendulum, length, the, center, of, oscillation, is, close, to, the, center, of, mass, the, radius, of, oscillation, or, equivalent, length, e, q, displaystyle, ell, mathrm, eq, of, any, physical, pendulum, can, be, shown, to, be, e, q, i, o, m, r, c, m, displaystyle, ell, mathrm, eq, frac, i, o, mr, mathrm, cm, where, i, o, displaystyle, i, o, is, the, moment, of, inertia, of, the, pendulum, about, the, pivot, point, o, displaystyle, o, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, total, mass, of, the, pendulum, and, r, c, m, displaystyle, r, mathrm, cm, is, the, distance, between, the, pivot, point, and, the, center, of, mass, substituting, this, expression, in, 1, above, the, period, t, displaystyle, t, of, a, compound, pendulum, is, given, by, t, 2, i, o, m, g, r, c, m, displaystyle, t, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, i, o, mgr, mathrm, cm, for, sufficiently, small, oscillations, for, example, a, rigid, uniform, rod, of, length, displaystyle, ell, pivoted, about, one, end, has, moment, of, inertia, i, o, 1, 3, m, 2, textstyle, i, o, frac, 1, 3, m, ell, 2, the, center, of, mass, is, located, at, the, center, of, the, rod, so, r, c, m, 1, 2, textstyle, r, mathrm, cm, frac, 1, 2, ell, substituting, these, values, into, the, above, equation, gives, t, 2, 2, 3, g, textstyle, t, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, frac, 2, 3, ell, g, this, shows, that, a, rigid, rod, pendulum, has, the, same, period, as, a, simple, pendulum, of, two, thirds, its, length, christiaan, huygens, proved, in, 1673, that, the, pivot, point, and, the, center, of, oscillation, are, interchangeable, this, means, if, any, pendulum, is, turned, upside, down, and, swung, from, a, pivot, located, at, its, previous, center, of, oscillation, it, will, have, the, same, period, as, before, and, the, new, center, of, oscillation, will, be, at, the, old, pivot, point, in, 1817, henry, kater, used, this, idea, to, produce, a, type, of, reversible, pendulum, now, known, as, a, kater, pendulum, for, improved, measurements, of, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, one, of, the, earliest, known, uses, of, a, pendulum, was, a, 1st, century, seismometer, device, of, han, dynasty, chinese, scientist, zhang, heng, its, function, was, to, sway, and, activate, one, of, a, series, of, levers, after, being, disturbed, by, the, tremor, of, an, earthquake, far, away, released, by, a, lever, a, small, ball, would, fall, out, of, the, urn, shaped, device, into, one, of, eight, metal, toads, mouths, below, at, the, eight, points, of, the, compass, signifying, the, direction, the, earthquake, was, located, many, sources, claim, that, the, 10th, century, egyptian, astronomer, ibn, yunus, used, a, pendulum, for, time, measurement, but, this, was, an, error, that, originated, in, 1684, with, the, british, historian, edward, bernard, during, the, renaissance, large, hand, pumped, pendulums, were, used, as, sources, of, power, for, manual, reciprocating, machines, such, as, saws, bellows, and, pumps, italian, scientist, galileo, galilei, was, the, first, to, study, the, properties, of, pendulums, beginning, around, 1602, the, first, recorded, interest, in, pendulums, made, by, galileo, was, around, 1588, in, his, posthumously, published, notes, titled, on, motion, in, which, he, noted, that, heavier, objects, would, continue, to, oscillate, for, a, greater, amount, of, time, than, lighter, objects, the, earliest, extant, report, of, his, experimental, research, is, contained, in, a, letter, to, guido, ubaldo, dal, monte, from, padua, dated, november, 29, 1602, his, biographer, and, student, vincenzo, viviani, claimed, his, interest, had, been, sparked, around, 1582, by, the, swinging, motion, of, a, chandelier, in, pisa, cathedral, galileo, discovered, the, crucial, property, that, makes, pendulums, useful, as, timekeepers, called, isochronism, the, period, of, the, pendulum, is, approximately, independent, of, the, amplitude, or, width, of, the, swing, he, also, found, that, the, period, is, independent, of, the, mass, of, the, bob, and, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, length, of, the, pendulum, he, first, employed, freeswinging, pendulums, in, simple, timing, applications, santorio, santori, in, 1602, invented, a, device, which, measured, a, patient, s, pulse, by, the, length, of, a, pendulum, the, pulsilogium, in, 1641, galileo, dictated, to, his, son, vincenzo, a, design, for, a, mechanism, to, keep, a, pendulum, swinging, which, has, been, described, as, the, first, pendulum, clock, vincenzo, began, construction, but, had, not, completed, it, when, he, died, in, 1649, in, 1656, the, dutch, scientist, christiaan, huygens, built, the, first, pendulum, clock, this, was, a, great, improvement, over, existing, mechanical, clocks, their, best, accuracy, was, improved, from, around, 15, minutes, deviation, a, day, to, around, 15, seconds, a, day, pendulums, spread, over, europe, as, existing, clocks, were, retrofitted, with, them, the, english, scientist, robert, hooke, studied, the, conical, pendulum, around, 1666, consisting, of, a, pendulum, that, is, free, to, swing, in, two, dimensions, with, the, bob, rotating, in, a, circle, or, ellipse, he, used, the, motions, of, this, device, as, a, model, to, analyze, the, orbital, motions, of, the, planets, hooke, suggested, to, isaac, newton, in, 1679, that, the, components, of, orbital, motion, consisted, of, inertial, motion, along, a, tangent, direction, plus, an, attractive, motion, in, the, radial, direction, this, played, a, part, in, newton, s, formulation, of, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, robert, hooke, was, also, responsible, for, suggesting, as, early, as, 1666, that, the, pendulum, could, be, used, to, measure, the, force, of, gravity, during, his, expedition, to, cayenne, french, guiana, in, 1671, jean, richer, found, that, a, pendulum, clock, was, 2, 1, 2, minutes, per, day, slower, at, cayenne, than, at, paris, from, this, he, deduced, that, the, force, of, gravity, was, lower, at, cayenne, in, 1687, isaac, newton, in, principia, mathematica, showed, that, this, was, because, the, earth, was, not, a, true, sphere, but, slightly, oblate, flattened, at, the, poles, from, the, effect, of, centrifugal, force, due, to, its, rotation, causing, gravity, to, increase, with, latitude, portable, pendulums, began, to, be, taken, on, voyages, to, distant, lands, as, precision, gravimeters, to, measure, the, acceleration, of, gravity, at, different, points, on, earth, eventually, resulting, in, accurate, models, of, the, shape, of, the, earth, in, 1673, 17, years, after, he, invented, the, pendulum, clock, christiaan, huygens, published, his, theory, of, the, pendulum, horologium, oscillatorium, sive, de, motu, pendulorum, marin, mersenne, and, ren, descartes, had, discovered, around, 1636, that, the, pendulum, was, not, quite, isochronous, its, period, increased, somewhat, with, its, amplitude, huygens, analyzed, this, problem, by, determining, what, curve, an, object, must, follow, to, descend, by, gravity, to, the, same, point, in, the, same, time, interval, regardless, of, starting, point, the, so, called, tautochrone, curve, by, a, complicated, method, that, was, an, early, use, of, calculus, he, showed, this, curve, was, a, cycloid, rather, than, the, circular, arc, of, a, pendulum, confirming, that, the, pendulum, was, not, isochronous, and, galileo, s, observation, of, isochronism, was, accurate, only, for, small, swings, huygens, also, solved, the, problem, of, how, to, calculate, the, period, of, an, arbitrarily, shaped, pendulum, called, a, compound, pendulum, discovering, the, center, of, oscillation, and, its, interchangeability, with, the, pivot, point, the, existing, clock, movement, the, verge, escapement, made, pendulums, swing, in, very, wide, arcs, of, about, 100, huygens, showed, this, was, a, source, of, inaccuracy, causing, the, period, to, vary, with, amplitude, changes, caused, by, small, unavoidable, variations, in, the, clock, s, drive, force, to, make, its, period, isochronous, huygens, mounted, cycloidal, shaped, metal, guides, next, to, the, pivots, in, his, clocks, that, constrained, the, suspension, cord, and, forced, the, pendulum, to, follow, a, cycloid, arc, see, cycloidal, pendulum, this, solution, didn, t, prove, as, practical, as, simply, limiting, the, pendulum, s, swing, to, small, angles, of, a, few, degrees, the, realization, that, only, small, swings, were, isochronous, motivated, the, development, of, the, anchor, escapement, around, 1670, which, reduced, the, pendulum, swing, in, clocks, to, 4, 6, this, became, the, standard, escapement, used, in, pendulum, clocks, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, the, pendulum, clock, s, role, as, the, most, accurate, timekeeper, motivated, much, practical, research, into, improving, pendulums, it, was, found, that, a, major, source, of, error, was, that, the, pendulum, rod, expanded, and, contracted, with, changes, in, ambient, temperature, changing, the, period, of, swing, this, was, solved, with, the, invention, of, temperature, compensated, pendulums, the, mercury, pendulum, in, 1721, and, the, gridiron, pendulum, in, 1726, reducing, errors, in, precision, pendulum, clocks, to, a, few, seconds, per, week, the, accuracy, of, gravity, measurements, made, with, pendulums, was, limited, by, the, difficulty, of, finding, the, location, of, their, center, of, oscillation, huygens, had, discovered, in, 1673, that, a, pendulum, has, the, same, period, when, hung, from, its, center, of, oscillation, as, when, hung, from, its, pivot, and, the, distance, between, the, two, points, was, equal, to, the, length, of, a, simple, gravity, pendulum, of, the, same, period, in, 1818, british, captain, henry, kater, invented, the, reversible, kater, s, pendulum, which, used, this, principle, making, possible, very, accurate, measurements, of, gravity, for, the, next, century, the, reversible, pendulum, was, the, standard, method, of, measuring, absolute, gravitational, acceleration, in, 1851, jean, bernard, l, on, foucault, showed, that, the, plane, of, oscillation, of, a, pendulum, like, a, gyroscope, tends, to, stay, constant, regardless, of, the, motion, of, the, pivot, and, that, this, could, be, used, to, demonstrate, the, rotation, of, the, earth, he, suspended, a, pendulum, free, to, swing, in, two, dimensions, later, named, the, foucault, pendulum, from, the, dome, of, the, panth, on, in, paris, the, length, of, the, cord, was, 67, m, 220, ft, once, the, pendulum, was, set, in, motion, the, plane, of, swing, was, observed, to, precess, or, rotate, 360, clockwise, in, about, 32, hours, this, was, the, first, demonstration, of, the, earth, s, rotation, that, did, not, depend, on, celestial, observations, and, a, pendulum, mania, broke, out, as, foucault, pendulums, were, displayed, in, many, cities, and, attracted, large, crowds, around, 1900, low, thermal, expansion, materials, began, to, be, used, for, pendulum, rods, in, the, highest, precision, clocks, and, other, instruments, first, invar, a, nickel, steel, alloy, and, later, fused, quartz, which, made, temperature, compensation, trivial, precision, pendulums, were, housed, in, low, pressure, tanks, which, kept, the, air, pressure, constant, to, prevent, changes, in, the, period, due, to, changes, in, buoyancy, of, the, pendulum, due, to, changing, atmospheric, pressure, the, best, pendulum, clocks, achieved, accuracy, of, around, a, second, per, year, the, timekeeping, accuracy, of, the, pendulum, was, exceeded, by, the, quartz, crystal, oscillator, invented, in, 1921, and, quartz, clocks, invented, in, 1927, replaced, pendulum, clocks, as, the, world, s, best, timekeepers, pendulum, clocks, were, used, as, time, standards, until, world, war, 2, although, the, french, time, service, continued, using, them, in, their, official, time, standard, ensemble, until, 1954, pendulum, gravimeters, were, superseded, by, free, fall, gravimeters, in, the, 1950s, but, pendulum, instruments, continued, to, be, used, into, the, 1970s, for, 300, years, from, its, discovery, around, 1582, until, development, of, the, quartz, clock, in, the, 1930s, the, pendulum, was, the, world, s, standard, for, accurate, timekeeping, in, addition, to, clock, pendulums, freeswinging, seconds, pendulums, were, widely, used, as, precision, timers, in, scientific, experiments, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, pendulums, require, great, mechanical, stability, a, length, change, of, only, 0, 02, 0, 2, mm, in, a, grandfather, clock, pendulum, will, cause, an, error, of, a, minute, per, week, pendulums, in, clocks, see, example, at, right, are, usually, made, of, a, weight, or, bob, b, suspended, by, a, rod, of, wood, or, metal, a, to, reduce, air, resistance, which, accounts, for, most, of, the, energy, loss, in, precision, clocks, the, bob, is, traditionally, a, smooth, disk, with, a, lens, shaped, cross, section, although, in, antique, clocks, it, often, had, carvings, or, decorations, specific, to, the, type, of, clock, in, quality, clocks, the, bob, is, made, as, heavy, as, the, suspension, can, support, and, the, movement, can, drive, since, this, improves, the, regulation, of, the, clock, see, accuracy, below, a, common, weight, for, seconds, pendulum, bobs, is, 15, pounds, 6, 8, kg, instead, of, hanging, from, a, pivot, clock, pendulums, are, usually, supported, by, a, short, straight, spring, d, of, flexible, metal, ribbon, this, avoids, the, friction, and, play, caused, by, a, pivot, and, the, slight, bending, force, of, the, spring, merely, adds, to, the, pendulum, s, restoring, force, the, highest, precision, clocks, have, pivots, of, knife, blades, resting, on, agate, plates, the, impulses, to, keep, the, pendulum, swinging, are, provided, by, an, arm, hanging, behind, the, pendulum, called, the, crutch, e, which, ends, in, a, fork, f, whose, prongs, embrace, the, pendulum, rod, the, crutch, is, pushed, back, and, forth, by, the, clock, s, escapement, g, h, each, time, the, pendulum, swings, through, its, centre, position, it, releases, one, tooth, of, the, escape, wheel, g, the, force, of, the, clock, s, mainspring, or, a, driving, weight, hanging, from, a, pulley, transmitted, through, the, clock, s, gear, train, causes, the, wheel, to, turn, and, a, tooth, presses, against, one, of, the, pallets, h, giving, the, pendulum, a, short, push, the, clock, s, wheels, geared, to, the, escape, wheel, move, forward, a, fixed, amount, with, each, pendulum, swing, advancing, the, clock, s, hands, at, a, steady, rate, the, pendulum, always, has, a, means, of, adjusting, the, period, usually, by, an, adjustment, nut, c, under, the, bob, which, moves, it, up, or, down, on, the, rod, moving, the, bob, up, decreases, the, pendulum, s, length, causing, the, pendulum, to, swing, faster, and, the, clock, to, gain, time, some, precision, clocks, have, a, small, auxiliary, adjustment, weight, on, a, threaded, shaft, on, the, bob, to, allow, finer, adjustment, some, tower, clocks, and, precision, clocks, use, a, tray, attached, near, to, the, midpoint, of, the, pendulum, rod, to, which, small, weights, can, be, added, or, removed, this, effectively, shifts, the, centre, of, oscillation, and, allows, the, rate, to, be, adjusted, without, stopping, the, clock, the, pendulum, must, be, suspended, from, a, rigid, support, during, operation, any, elasticity, will, allow, tiny, imperceptible, swaying, motions, of, the, support, which, disturbs, the, clock, s, period, resulting, in, error, pendulum, clocks, should, be, attached, firmly, to, a, sturdy, wall, the, most, common, pendulum, length, in, quality, clocks, which, is, always, used, in, grandfather, clocks, is, the, seconds, pendulum, about, 1, metre, 39, inches, long, in, mantel, clocks, half, second, pendulums, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, long, or, shorter, are, used, only, a, few, large, tower, clocks, use, longer, pendulums, the, 1, 5, second, pendulum, 2, 25, m, 7, 4, ft, long, or, occasionally, the, two, second, pendulum, 4, m, 13, ft, which, is, used, in, big, ben, the, largest, source, of, error, in, early, pendulums, was, slight, changes, in, length, due, to, thermal, expansion, and, contraction, of, the, pendulum, rod, with, changes, in, ambient, temperature, this, was, discovered, when, people, noticed, that, pendulum, clocks, ran, slower, in, summer, by, as, much, as, a, minute, per, week, one, of, the, first, was, godefroy, wendelin, as, reported, by, huygens, in, 1658, thermal, expansion, of, pendulum, rods, was, first, studied, by, jean, picard, in, 1669, a, pendulum, with, a, steel, rod, will, expand, by, about, 11, 3, parts, per, million, ppm, with, each, degree, celsius, increase, causing, it, to, lose, about, 0, 27, seconds, per, day, for, every, degree, celsius, increase, in, temperature, or, 9, seconds, per, day, for, a, 33, c, 59, f, change, wood, rods, expand, less, losing, only, about, 6, seconds, per, day, for, a, 33, c, 59, f, change, which, is, why, quality, clocks, often, had, wooden, pendulum, rods, the, wood, had, to, be, varnished, to, prevent, water, vapor, from, getting, in, because, changes, in, humidity, also, affected, the, length, the, first, device, to, compensate, for, this, error, was, the, mercury, pendulum, invented, by, george, graham, in, 1721, the, liquid, metal, mercury, expands, in, volume, with, temperature, in, a, mercury, pendulum, the, pendulum, s, weight, bob, is, a, container, of, mercury, with, a, temperature, rise, the, pendulum, rod, gets, longer, but, the, mercury, also, expands, and, its, surface, level, rises, slightly, in, the, container, moving, its, centre, of, mass, closer, to, the, pendulum, pivot, by, using, the, correct, height, of, mercury, in, the, container, these, two, effects, will, cancel, leaving, the, pendulum, s, centre, of, mass, and, its, period, unchanged, with, temperature, its, main, disadvantage, was, that, when, the, temperature, changed, the, rod, would, come, to, the, new, temperature, quickly, but, the, mass, of, mercury, might, take, a, day, or, two, to, reach, the, new, temperature, causing, the, rate, to, deviate, during, that, time, to, improve, thermal, accommodation, several, thin, containers, were, often, used, made, of, metal, mercury, pendulums, were, the, standard, used, in, precision, regulator, clocks, into, the, 20th, century, the, most, widely, used, compensated, pendulum, was, the, gridiron, pendulum, invented, in, 1726, by, john, harrison, this, consists, of, alternating, rods, of, two, different, metals, one, with, lower, thermal, expansion, cte, steel, and, one, with, higher, thermal, expansion, zinc, or, brass, the, rods, are, connected, by, a, frame, as, shown, in, the, drawing, at, the, right, so, that, an, increase, in, length, of, the, zinc, rods, pushes, the, bob, up, shortening, the, pendulum, with, a, temperature, increase, the, low, expansion, steel, rods, make, the, pendulum, longer, while, the, high, expansion, zinc, rods, make, it, shorter, by, making, the, rods, of, the, correct, lengths, the, greater, expansion, of, the, zinc, cancels, out, the, expansion, of, the, steel, rods, which, have, a, greater, combined, length, and, the, pendulum, stays, the, same, length, with, temperature, zinc, steel, gridiron, pendulums, are, made, with, 5, rods, but, the, thermal, expansion, of, brass, is, closer, to, steel, so, brass, steel, gridirons, usually, require, 9, rods, gridiron, pendulums, adjust, to, temperature, changes, faster, than, mercury, pendulums, but, scientists, found, that, friction, of, the, rods, sliding, in, their, holes, in, the, frame, caused, gridiron, pendulums, to, adjust, in, a, series, of, tiny, jumps, in, high, precision, clocks, this, caused, the, clock, s, rate, to, change, suddenly, with, each, jump, later, it, was, found, that, zinc, is, subject, to, creep, for, these, reasons, mercury, pendulums, were, used, in, the, highest, precision, clocks, but, gridirons, were, used, in, quality, regulator, clocks, gridiron, pendulums, became, so, associated, with, good, quality, that, to, this, day, many, ordinary, clock, pendulums, have, decorative, fake, gridirons, that, don, t, actually, have, any, temperature, compensation, function, around, 1900, low, thermal, expansion, materials, were, developed, which, could, be, used, as, pendulum, rods, in, order, to, make, elaborate, temperature, compensation, unnecessary, these, were, only, used, in, a, few, of, the, highest, precision, clocks, before, the, pendulum, became, obsolete, as, a, time, standard, in, 1896, charles, douard, guillaume, invented, the, nickel, steel, alloy, invar, this, has, a, cte, of, around, 0, 9, ppm, c, 0, 5, ppm, f, resulting, in, pendulum, temperature, errors, over, 22, c, 71, f, of, only, 1, 3, seconds, per, day, and, this, residual, error, could, be, compensated, to, zero, with, a, few, centimeters, of, aluminium, under, the, pendulum, bob, this, can, be, seen, in, the, riefler, clock, image, above, invar, pendulums, were, first, used, in, 1898, in, the, riefler, regulator, clock, which, achieved, accuracy, of, 15, milliseconds, per, day, suspension, springs, of, elinvar, were, used, to, eliminate, temperature, variation, of, the, spring, s, restoring, force, on, the, pendulum, later, fused, quartz, was, used, which, had, even, lower, cte, these, materials, are, the, choice, for, modern, high, accuracy, pendulums, the, effect, of, the, surrounding, air, on, a, moving, pendulum, is, complex, and, requires, fluid, mechanics, to, calculate, precisely, but, for, most, purposes, its, influence, on, the, period, can, be, accounted, for, by, three, effects, increases, in, barometric, pressure, increase, a, pendulum, s, period, slightly, due, to, the, first, two, effects, by, about, 0, 11, seconds, per, day, per, kilopascal, 0, 37, seconds, per, day, per, inch, of, mercury, 0, 015, seconds, per, day, per, torr, researchers, using, pendulums, to, measure, the, acceleration, of, gravity, had, to, correct, the, period, for, the, air, pressure, at, the, altitude, of, measurement, computing, the, equivalent, period, of, a, pendulum, swinging, in, vacuum, a, pendulum, clock, was, first, operated, in, a, constant, pressure, tank, by, friedrich, tiede, in, 1865, at, the, berlin, observatory, and, by, 1900, the, highest, precision, clocks, were, mounted, in, tanks, that, were, kept, at, a, constant, pressure, to, eliminate, changes, in, atmospheric, pressure, alternatively, in, some, a, small, aneroid, barometer, mechanism, attached, to, the, pendulum, compensated, for, this, effect, pendulums, are, affected, by, changes, in, gravitational, acceleration, which, varies, by, as, much, as, 0, 5, at, different, locations, on, earth, so, precision, pendulum, clocks, have, to, be, recalibrated, after, a, move, even, moving, a, pendulum, clock, to, the, top, of, a, tall, building, can, cause, it, to, lose, measurable, time, from, the, reduction, in, gravity, the, timekeeping, elements, in, all, clocks, which, include, pendulums, balance, wheels, the, quartz, crystals, used, in, quartz, watches, and, even, the, vibrating, atoms, in, atomic, clocks, are, in, physics, called, harmonic, oscillators, the, reason, harmonic, oscillators, are, used, in, clocks, is, that, they, vibrate, or, oscillate, at, a, specific, resonant, frequency, or, period, and, resist, oscillating, at, other, rates, however, the, resonant, frequency, is, not, infinitely, sharp, around, the, resonant, frequency, there, is, a, narrow, natural, band, of, frequencies, or, periods, called, the, resonance, width, or, bandwidth, where, the, harmonic, oscillator, will, oscillate, in, a, clock, the, actual, frequency, of, the, pendulum, may, vary, randomly, within, this, resonance, width, in, response, to, disturbances, but, at, frequencies, outside, this, band, the, clock, will, not, function, at, all, the, resonance, width, is, determined, by, the, damping, the, frictional, energy, loss, per, swing, of, the, pendulum, the, measure, of, a, harmonic, oscillator, s, resistance, to, disturbances, to, its, oscillation, period, is, a, dimensionless, parameter, called, the, q, factor, equal, to, the, resonant, frequency, divided, by, the, resonance, width, the, higher, the, q, the, smaller, the, resonance, width, and, the, more, constant, the, frequency, or, period, of, the, oscillator, for, a, given, disturbance, the, reciprocal, of, the, q, is, roughly, proportional, to, the, limiting, accuracy, achievable, by, a, harmonic, oscillator, as, a, time, standard, the, q, is, related, to, how, long, it, takes, for, the, oscillations, of, an, oscillator, to, die, out, the, q, of, a, pendulum, can, be, measured, by, counting, the, number, of, oscillations, it, takes, for, the, amplitude, of, the, pendulum, s, swing, to, decay, to, 1, e, 36, 8, of, its, initial, swing, and, multiplying, by, in, a, clock, the, pendulum, must, receive, pushes, from, the, clock, s, movement, to, keep, it, swinging, to, replace, the, energy, the, pendulum, loses, to, friction, these, pushes, applied, by, a, mechanism, called, the, escapement, are, the, main, source, of, disturbance, to, the, pendulum, s, motion, the, q, is, equal, to, 2, times, the, energy, stored, in, the, pendulum, divided, by, the, energy, lost, to, friction, during, each, oscillation, period, which, is, the, same, as, the, energy, added, by, the, escapement, each, period, it, can, be, seen, that, the, smaller, the, fraction, of, the, pendulum, s, energy, that, is, lost, to, friction, the, less, energy, needs, to, be, added, the, less, the, disturbance, from, the, escapement, the, more, independent, the, pendulum, is, of, the, clock, s, mechanism, and, the, more, constant, its, period, is, the, q, of, a, pendulum, is, given, by, q, m, displaystyle, q, frac, m, omega, gamma, where, m, is, the, mass, of, the, bob, 2, t, is, the, pendulum, s, radian, frequency, of, oscillation, and, is, the, frictional, damping, force, on, the, pendulum, per, unit, velocity, is, fixed, by, the, pendulum, s, period, and, m, is, limited, by, the, load, capacity, and, rigidity, of, the, suspension, so, the, q, of, clock, pendulums, is, increased, by, minimizing, frictional, losses, precision, pendulums, are, suspended, on, low, friction, pivots, consisting, of, triangular, shaped, knife, edges, resting, on, agate, plates, around, 99, of, the, energy, loss, in, a, freeswinging, pendulum, is, due, to, air, friction, so, mounting, a, pendulum, in, a, vacuum, tank, can, increase, the, q, and, thus, the, accuracy, by, a, factor, of, 100, the, q, of, pendulums, ranges, from, several, thousand, in, an, ordinary, clock, to, several, hundred, thousand, for, precision, regulator, pendulums, swinging, in, vacuum, a, quality, home, pendulum, clock, might, have, a, q, of, 10, 000, and, an, accuracy, of, 10, seconds, per, month, the, most, accurate, commercially, produced, pendulum, clock, was, the, shortt, synchronome, free, pendulum, clock, invented, in, 1921, its, invar, master, pendulum, swinging, in, a, vacuum, tank, had, a, q, of, 110, 000, and, an, error, rate, of, around, a, second, per, year, their, q, of, 10, 3, 10, 5, is, one, reason, why, pendulums, are, more, accurate, timekeepers, than, the, balance, wheels, in, watches, with, q, around, 100, 300, but, less, accurate, than, the, quartz, crystals, in, quartz, clocks, with, q, of, 10, 5, 10, 6, pendulums, unlike, for, example, quartz, crystals, have, a, low, enough, q, that, the, disturbance, caused, by, the, impulses, to, keep, them, moving, is, generally, the, limiting, factor, on, their, timekeeping, accuracy, therefore, the, design, of, the, escapement, the, mechanism, that, provides, these, impulses, has, a, large, effect, on, the, accuracy, of, a, clock, pendulum, if, the, impulses, given, to, the, pendulum, by, the, escapement, each, swing, could, be, exactly, identical, the, response, of, the, pendulum, would, be, identical, and, its, period, would, be, constant, however, this, is, not, achievable, unavoidable, random, fluctuations, in, the, force, due, to, friction, of, the, clock, s, pallets, lubrication, variations, and, changes, in, the, torque, provided, by, the, clock, s, power, source, as, it, runs, down, mean, that, the, force, of, the, impulse, applied, by, the, escapement, varies, if, these, variations, in, the, escapement, s, force, cause, changes, in, the, pendulum, s, width, of, swing, amplitude, this, will, cause, corresponding, slight, changes, in, the, period, since, as, discussed, at, top, a, pendulum, with, a, finite, swing, is, not, quite, isochronous, therefore, the, goal, of, traditional, escapement, design, is, to, apply, the, force, with, the, proper, profile, and, at, the, correct, point, in, the, pendulum, s, cycle, so, force, variations, have, no, effect, on, the, pendulum, s, amplitude, this, is, called, an, isochronous, escapement, clockmakers, had, known, for, centuries, that, the, disturbing, effect, of, the, escapement, s, drive, force, on, the, period, of, a, pendulum, is, smallest, if, given, as, a, short, impulse, as, the, pendulum, passes, through, its, bottom, equilibrium, position, if, the, impulse, occurs, before, the, pendulum, reaches, bottom, during, the, downward, swing, it, will, have, the, effect, of, shortening, the, pendulum, s, natural, period, so, an, increase, in, drive, force, will, decrease, the, period, if, the, impulse, occurs, after, the, pendulum, reaches, bottom, during, the, upswing, it, will, lengthen, the, period, so, an, increase, in, drive, force, will, increase, the, pendulum, s, period, in, 1826, british, astronomer, george, airy, proved, this, specifically, he, proved, that, if, a, pendulum, is, driven, by, an, impulse, that, is, symmetrical, about, its, bottom, equilibrium, position, the, pendulum, s, period, will, be, unaffected, by, changes, in, the, drive, force, the, most, accurate, escapements, such, as, the, deadbeat, approximately, satisfy, this, condition, the, presence, of, the, acceleration, of, gravity, g, in, the, periodicity, equation, 1, for, a, pendulum, means, that, the, local, gravitational, acceleration, of, the, earth, can, be, calculated, from, the, period, of, a, pendulum, a, pendulum, can, therefore, be, used, as, a, gravimeter, to, measure, the, local, gravity, which, varies, by, over, 0, 5, across, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, pendulum, in, a, clock, is, disturbed, by, the, pushes, it, receives, from, the, clock, movement, so, freeswinging, pendulums, were, used, and, were, the, standard, instruments, of, gravimetry, up, to, the, 1930s, the, difference, between, clock, pendulums, and, gravimeter, pendulums, is, that, to, measure, gravity, the, pendulum, s, length, as, well, as, its, period, has, to, be, measured, the, period, of, freeswinging, pendulums, could, be, found, to, great, precision, by, comparing, their, swing, with, a, precision, clock, that, had, been, adjusted, to, keep, correct, time, by, the, passage, of, stars, overhead, in, the, early, measurements, a, weight, on, a, cord, was, suspended, in, front, of, the, clock, pendulum, and, its, length, adjusted, until, the, two, pendulums, swung, in, exact, synchronism, then, the, length, of, the, cord, was, measured, from, the, length, and, the, period, g, could, be, calculated, from, equation, 1, the, seconds, pendulum, a, pendulum, with, a, period, of, two, seconds, so, each, swing, takes, one, second, was, widely, used, to, measure, gravity, because, its, period, could, be, easily, measured, by, comparing, it, to, precision, regulator, clocks, which, all, had, seconds, pendulums, by, the, late, 17th, century, the, length, of, the, seconds, pendulum, became, the, standard, measure, of, the, strength, of, gravitational, acceleration, at, a, location, by, 1700, its, length, had, been, measured, with, submillimeter, accuracy, at, several, cities, in, europe, for, a, seconds, pendulum, g, is, proportional, to, its, length, g, l, displaystyle, g, propto, l, the, precision, of, the, early, gravity, measurements, above, was, limited, by, the, difficulty, of, measuring, the, length, of, the, pendulum, l, l, was, the, length, of, an, idealized, simple, gravity, pendulum, described, at, top, which, has, all, its, mass, concentrated, in, a, point, at, the, end, of, the, cord, in, 1673, huygens, had, shown, that, the, period, of, a, rigid, bar, pendulum, called, a, compound, pendulum, was, equal, to, the, period, of, a, simple, pendulum, with, a, length, equal, to, the, distance, between, the, pivot, point, and, a, point, called, the, center, of, oscillation, located, under, the, center, of, gravity, that, depends, on, the, mass, distribution, along, the, pendulum, but, there, was, no, accurate, way, of, determining, the, center, of, oscillation, in, a, real, pendulum, huygens, discovery, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, huygens, law, of, the, cycloidal, pendulum, to, get, around, this, problem, the, early, researchers, above, approximated, an, ideal, simple, pendulum, as, closely, as, possible, by, using, a, metal, sphere, suspended, by, a, light, wire, or, cord, if, the, wire, was, light, enough, the, center, of, oscillation, was, close, to, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, ball, at, its, geometric, center, this, ball, and, wire, type, of, pendulum, wasn, t, very, accurate, because, it, didn, t, swing, as, a, rigid, body, and, the, elasticity, of, the, wire, caused, its, length, to, change, slightly, as, the, pendulum, swung, however, huygens, had, also, proved, that, in, any, pendulum, the, pivot, point, and, the, center, of, oscillation, were, interchangeable, that, is, if, a, pendulum, were, turned, upside, down, and, hung, from, its, center, of, oscillation, it, would, have, the, same, period, as, it, did, in, the, previous, position, and, the, old, pivot, point, would, be, the, new, center, of, oscillation, british, physicist, and, army, captain, henry, kater, in, 1817, realized, that, huygens, principle, could, be, used, to, find, the, length, of, a, simple, pendulum, with, the, same, period, as, a, real, pendulum, if, a, pendulum, was, built, with, a, second, adjustable, pivot, point, near, the, bottom, so, it, could, be, hung, upside, down, and, the, second, pivot, was, adjusted, until, the, periods, when, hung, from, both, pivots, were, the, same, the, second, pivot, would, be, at, the, center, of, oscillation, and, the, distance, between, the, two, pivots, would, be, the, length, l, of, a, simple, pendulum, with, the, same, period, kater, built, a, reversible, pendulum, see, drawing, consisting, of, a, brass, bar, with, two, opposing, pivots, made, of, short, triangular, knife, blades, a, near, either, end, it, could, be, swung, from, either, pivot, with, the, knife, blades, supported, on, agate, plates, rather, than, make, one, pivot, adjustable, he, attached, the, pivots, a, meter, apart, and, instead, adjusted, the, periods, with, a, moveable, weight, on, the, pendulum, rod, b, c, in, operation, the, pendulum, is, hung, in, front, of, a, precision, clock, and, the, period, timed, then, turned, upside, down, and, the, period, timed, again, the, weight, is, adjusted, with, the, adjustment, screw, until, the, periods, are, equal, then, putting, this, period, and, the, distance, between, the, pivots, into, equation, 1, gives, the, gravitational, acceleration, g, very, accurately, kater, timed, the, swing, of, his, pendulum, using, the, method, of, coincidences, and, measured, the, distance, between, the, two, pivots, with, a, micrometer, after, applying, corrections, for, the, finite, amplitude, of, swing, the, buoyancy, of, the, bob, the, barometric, pressure, and, altitude, and, temperature, he, obtained, a, value, of, 39, 13929, inches, for, the, seconds, pendulum, at, london, in, vacuum, at, sea, level, at, 62, f, the, largest, variation, from, the, mean, of, his, 12, observations, was, 0, 00028, in, representing, a, precision, of, gravity, measurement, of, 7, 10, 6, 7, mgal, or, 70, m, s, 2, kater, s, measurement, was, used, as, britain, s, official, standard, of, length, see, below, from, 1824, to, 1855, reversible, pendulums, known, technically, as, convertible, pendulums, employing, kater, s, principle, were, used, for, absolute, gravity, measurements, into, the, 1930s, the, increased, accuracy, made, possible, by, kater, s, pendulum, helped, make, gravimetry, a, standard, part, of, geodesy, since, the, exact, location, latitude, and, longitude, of, the, station, where, the, gravity, measurement, was, made, was, necessary, gravity, measurements, became, part, of, surveying, and, pendulums, were, taken, on, the, great, geodetic, surveys, of, the, 18th, century, particularly, the, great, trigonometric, survey, of, india, relative, pendulum, gravimeters, were, superseded, by, the, simpler, lacoste, zero, length, spring, gravimeter, invented, in, 1934, by, lucien, lacoste, absolute, reversible, pendulum, gravimeters, were, replaced, in, the, 1950s, by, free, fall, gravimeters, in, which, a, weight, is, allowed, to, fall, in, a, vacuum, tank, and, its, acceleration, is, measured, by, an, optical, interferometer, because, the, acceleration, of, gravity, is, constant, at, a, given, point, on, earth, the, period, of, a, simple, pendulum, at, a, given, location, depends, only, on, its, length, additionally, gravity, varies, only, slightly, at, different, locations, almost, from, the, pendulum, s, discovery, until, the, early, 19th, century, this, property, led, scientists, to, suggest, using, a, pendulum, of, a, given, period, as, a, standard, of, length, until, the, 19th, century, countries, based, their, systems, of, length, measurement, on, prototypes, metal, bar, primary, standards, such, as, the, standard, yard, in, britain, kept, at, the, houses, of, parliament, and, the, standard, toise, in, france, kept, at, paris, these, were, vulnerable, to, damage, or, destruction, over, the, years, and, because, of, the, difficulty, of, comparing, prototypes, the, same, unit, often, had, different, lengths, in, distant, towns, creating, opportunities, for, fraud, during, the, enlightenment, scientists, argued, for, a, length, standard, that, was, based, on, some, property, of, nature, that, could, be, determined, by, measurement, creating, an, indestructible, universal, standard, the, period, of, pendulums, could, be, measured, very, precisely, by, timing, them, with, clocks, that, were, set, by, the, stars, a, pendulum, standard, amounted, to, defining, the, unit, of, length, by, the, gravitational, force, of, the, earth, for, all, intents, constant, and, the, second, which, was, defined, by, the, rotation, rate, of, the, earth, also, constant, the, idea, was, that, anyone, anywhere, on, earth, could, recreate, the, standard, by, constructing, a, pendulum, that, swung, with, the, defined, period, and, measuring, its, length, virtually, all, proposals, were, based, on, the, seconds, pendulum, in, which, each, swing, a, half, period, takes, one, second, which, is, about, a, meter, 39, inches, long, because, by, the, late, 17th, century, it, had, become, a, standard, for, measuring, gravity, see, previous, section, by, the, 18th, century, its, length, had, been, measured, with, sub, millimeter, accuracy, at, a, number, of, cities, in, europe, and, around, the, world, the, initial, attraction, of, the, pendulum, length, standard, was, that, it, was, believed, by, early, scientists, such, as, huygens, and, wren, that, gravity, was, constant, over, the, earth, s, surface, so, a, given, pendulum, had, the, same, period, at, any, point, on, earth, so, the, length, of, the, standard, pendulum, could, be, measured, at, any, location, and, would, not, be, tied, to, any, given, nation, or, region, it, would, be, a, truly, democratic, worldwide, standard, although, richer, found, in, 1672, that, gravity, varies, at, different, points, on, the, globe, the, idea, of, a, pendulum, length, standard, remained, popular, because, it, was, found, that, gravity, only, varies, with, latitude, gravitational, acceleration, increases, smoothly, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, due, to, the, oblate, shape, of, the, earth, so, at, any, given, latitude, east, west, line, gravity, was, constant, enough, that, the, length, of, a, seconds, pendulum, was, the, same, within, the, measurement, capability, of, the, 18th, century, thus, the, unit, of, length, could, be, defined, at, a, given, latitude, and, measured, at, any, point, along, that, latitude, for, example, a, pendulum, standard, defined, at, 45, north, latitude, a, popular, choice, could, be, measured, in, parts, of, france, italy, croatia, serbia, romania, russia, kazakhstan, china, mongolia, the, united, states, and, canada, in, addition, it, could, be, recreated, at, any, location, at, which, the, gravitational, acceleration, had, been, accurately, measured, by, the, mid, 19th, century, increasingly, accurate, pendulum, measurements, by, edward, sabine, and, thomas, young, revealed, that, gravity, and, thus, the, length, of, any, pendulum, standard, varied, measurably, with, local, geologic, features, such, as, mountains, and, dense, subsurface, rocks, so, a, pendulum, length, standard, had, to, be, defined, at, a, single, point, on, earth, and, could, only, be, measured, there, this, took, much, of, the, appeal, from, the, concept, and, efforts, to, adopt, pendulum, standards, were, abandoned, one, of, the, first, to, suggest, defining, length, with, a, pendulum, was, flemish, scientist, isaac, beeckman, who, in, 1631, recommended, making, the, seconds, pendulum, the, invariable, measure, for, all, people, at, all, times, in, all, places, marin, mersenne, who, first, measured, the, seconds, pendulum, in, 1644, also, suggested, it, the, first, official, proposal, for, a, pendulum, standard, was, made, by, the, british, royal, society, in, 1660, advocated, by, christiaan, huygens, and, ole, r, mer, basing, it, on, mersenne, s, work, and, huygens, in, horologium, oscillatorium, proposed, a, horary, foot, defined, as, 1, 3, of, the, seconds, pendulum, christopher, wren, was, another, early, supporter, the, idea, of, a, pendulum, standard, of, length, must, have, been, familiar, to, people, as, early, as, 1663, because, samuel, butler, satirizes, it, in, hudibras, in, 1671, jean, picard, proposed, a, pendulum, defined, universal, foot, in, his, influential, mesure, de, la, terre, gabriel, mouton, around, 1670, suggested, defining, the, toise, either, by, a, seconds, pendulum, or, a, minute, of, terrestrial, degree, a, plan, for, a, complete, system, of, units, based, on, the, pendulum, was, advanced, in, 1675, by, italian, polymath, tito, livio, burratini, in, france, in, 1747, geographer, charles, marie, de, la, condamine, proposed, defining, length, by, a, seconds, pendulum, at, the, equator, since, at, this, location, a, pendulum, s, swing, wouldn, t, be, distorted, by, the, earth, s, rotation, james, steuart, 1780, and, george, skene, keith, were, also, supporters, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, when, many, nations, were, reforming, their, weight, and, measure, systems, the, seconds, pendulum, was, the, leading, choice, for, a, new, definition, of, length, advocated, by, prominent, scientists, in, several, major, nations, in, 1790, then, us, secretary, of, state, thomas, jefferson, proposed, to, congress, a, comprehensive, decimalized, us, metric, system, based, on, the, seconds, pendulum, at, 38, north, latitude, the, mean, latitude, of, the, united, states, no, action, was, taken, on, this, proposal, in, britain, the, leading, advocate, of, the, pendulum, was, politician, john, riggs, miller, when, his, efforts, to, promote, a, joint, british, french, american, metric, system, fell, through, in, 1790, he, proposed, a, british, system, based, on, the, length, of, the, seconds, pendulum, at, london, this, standard, was, adopted, in, 1824, below, in, the, discussions, leading, up, to, the, french, adoption, of, the, metric, system, in, 1791, the, leading, candidate, for, the, definition, of, the, new, unit, of, length, the, metre, was, the, seconds, pendulum, at, 45, north, latitude, it, was, advocated, by, a, group, led, by, french, politician, talleyrand, and, mathematician, antoine, nicolas, caritat, de, condorcet, this, was, one, of, the, three, final, options, considered, by, the, french, academy, of, sciences, committee, however, on, march, 19, 1791, the, committee, instead, chose, to, base, the, metre, on, the, length, of, the, meridian, through, paris, a, pendulum, definition, was, rejected, because, of, its, variability, at, different, locations, and, because, it, defined, length, by, a, unit, of, time, however, since, 1983, the, metre, has, been, officially, defined, in, terms, of, the, length, of, the, second, and, the, speed, of, light, a, possible, additional, reason, is, that, the, radical, french, academy, didn, t, want, to, base, their, new, system, on, the, second, a, traditional, and, nondecimal, unit, from, the, ancien, regime, although, not, defined, by, the, pendulum, the, final, length, chosen, for, the, metre, 10, 7, of, the, pole, to, equator, meridian, arc, was, very, close, to, the, length, of, the, seconds, pendulum, 0, 9937, m, within, 0, 63, although, no, reason, for, this, particular, choice, was, given, at, the, time, it, was, probably, to, facilitate, the, use, of, the, seconds, pendulum, as, a, secondary, standard, as, was, proposed, in, the, official, document, so, the, modern, world, s, standard, unit, of, length, is, certainly, closely, linked, historically, with, the, seconds, pendulum, britain, and, denmark, appear, to, be, the, only, nations, that, for, a, short, time, based, their, units, of, length, on, the, pendulum, in, 1821, the, danish, inch, was, defined, as, 1, 38, of, the, length, of, the, mean, solar, seconds, pendulum, at, 45, latitude, at, the, meridian, of, skagen, at, sea, level, in, vacuum, the, british, parliament, passed, the, imperial, weights, and, measures, act, in, 1824, a, reform, of, the, british, standard, system, which, declared, that, if, the, prototype, standard, yard, was, destroyed, it, would, be, recovered, by, defining, the, inch, so, that, the, length, of, the, solar, seconds, pendulum, at, london, at, sea, level, in, a, vacuum, at, 62, f, was, 39, 1393, inches, this, also, became, the, us, standard, since, at, the, time, the, us, used, british, measures, however, when, the, prototype, yard, was, lost, in, the, 1834, houses, of, parliament, fire, it, proved, impossible, to, recreate, it, accurately, from, the, pendulum, definition, and, in, 1855, britain, repealed, the, pendulum, standard, and, returned, to, prototype, standards, a, pendulum, in, which, the, rod, is, not, vertical, but, almost, horizontal, was, used, in, early, seismometers, for, measuring, earth, tremors, the, bob, of, the, pendulum, does, not, move, when, its, mounting, does, and, the, difference, in, the, movements, is, recorded, on, a, drum, chart, as, first, explained, by, maximilian, schuler, in, a, 1923, paper, a, pendulum, whose, period, exactly, equals, the, orbital, period, of, a, hypothetical, satellite, orbiting, just, above, the, surface, of, the, earth, about, 84, minutes, will, tend, to, remain, pointing, at, the, center, of, the, earth, when, its, support, is, suddenly, displaced, this, principle, called, schuler, tuning, is, used, in, inertial, guidance, systems, in, ships, and, aircraft, that, operate, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, no, physical, pendulum, is, used, but, the, control, system, that, keeps, the, inertial, platform, containing, the, gyroscopes, stable, is, modified, so, the, device, acts, as, though, it, is, attached, to, such, a, pendulum, keeping, the, platform, always, facing, down, as, the, vehicle, moves, on, the, curved, surface, of, the, earth, in, 1665, huygens, made, a, curious, observation, about, pendulum, clocks, two, clocks, had, been, placed, on, his, mantlepiece, and, he, noted, that, they, had, acquired, an, opposing, motion, that, is, their, pendulums, were, beating, in, unison, but, in, the, opposite, direction, 180, out, of, phase, regardless, of, how, the, two, clocks, were, started, he, found, that, they, would, eventually, return, to, this, state, thus, making, the, first, recorded, observation, of, a, coupled, oscillator, the, cause, of, this, behavior, was, that, the, two, pendulums, were, affecting, each, other, through, slight, motions, of, the, supporting, mantlepiece, this, process, is, called, entrainment, or, mode, locking, in, physics, and, is, observed, in, other, coupled, oscillators, synchronized, pendulums, have, been, used, in, clocks, and, were, widely, used, in, gravimeters, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, huygens, only, observed, out, of, phase, synchronization, recent, investigations, have, shown, the, existence, of, in, phase, synchronization, as, well, as, death, states, wherein, one, or, both, clocks, stops, pendulum, motion, appears, in, religious, ceremonies, as, well, the, swinging, incense, burner, called, a, censer, also, known, as, a, thurible, is, an, example, of, a, pendulum, pendulums, are, also, seen, at, many, gatherings, in, eastern, mexico, where, they, mark, the, turning, of, the, tides, on, the, day, which, the, tides, are, at, their, highest, point, see, also, pendulums, for, divination, and, dowsing, pendulums, are, widely, used, in, science, education, as, an, example, of, a, harmonic, oscillator, to, teach, dynamics, and, oscillatory, motion, one, use, is, to, demonstrate, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, a, heavy, object, such, as, a, bowling, ball, or, wrecking, ball, is, attached, to, a, string, the, weight, is, then, moved, to, within, a, few, inches, of, a, volunteer, s, face, then, released, and, allowed, to, swing, and, come, back, in, most, instances, the, weight, reverses, direction, and, then, returns, to, almost, the, same, position, as, the, original, release, location, i, e, a, small, distance, from, the, volunteer, s, face, thus, leaving, the, volunteer, unharmed, on, occasion, the, volunteer, is, injured, if, either, the, volunteer, does, not, stand, still, or, the, pendulum, is, initially, released, with, a, push, so, that, when, it, returns, it, surpasses, the, release, position, it, is, claimed, that, the, pendulum, was, used, as, an, instrument, of, torture, and, execution, by, the, spanish, inquisition, in, the, 18th, century, the, allegation, is, contained, in, the, 1826, book, the, history, of, the, inquisition, of, spain, by, the, spanish, priest, historian, and, liberal, activist, juan, antonio, llorente, a, swinging, pendulum, whose, edge, is, a, knife, blade, slowly, descends, toward, a, bound, prisoner, until, it, cuts, into, his, body, this, method, of, torture, came, to, popular, consciousness, through, the, 1842, short, story, the, pit, and, the, pendulum, by, american, author, edgar, allan, poe, but, there, is, considerable, skepticism, that, it, actually, was, used, most, knowledgeable, sources, are, skeptical, that, this, torture, was, ever, actually, used, the, only, evidence, of, its, use, is, one, paragraph, in, the, preface, to, llorente, s, 1826, history, relating, a, second, hand, account, by, a, single, prisoner, released, from, the, inquisition, s, madrid, dungeon, in, 1820, who, purportedly, described, the, pendulum, torture, method, modern, sources, point, out, that, due, to, jesus, admonition, against, bloodshed, inquisitors, were, only, allowed, to, use, torture, methods, which, did, not, spill, blood, and, the, pendulum, method, would, have, violated, this, stricture, one, theory, is, that, llorente, misunderstood, the, account, he, heard, the, prisoner, was, actually, referring, to, another, common, inquisition, torture, the, strappado, garrucha, in, which, the, prisoner, has, his, hands, tied, behind, his, back, and, is, hoisted, off, the, floor, by, a, rope, tied, to, his, hands, this, method, was, also, known, as, the, pendulum, poe, s, popular, horror, tale, and, public, awareness, of, the, inquisition, s, other, brutal, methods, has, kept, the, myth, of, this, elaborate, torture, method, alive, a, pendulum, wave, is, a, physics, demonstration, and, kinetic, art, comprising, several, uncoupled, pendulums, with, different, lengths, as, the, pendulums, oscillate, they, appear, to, produce, travelling, and, standing, waves, beating, and, random, motion, the, value, of, g, reflected, by, the, period, of, a, pendulum, varies, from, place, to, place, the, gravitational, force, varies, with, distance, from, the, center, of, the, earth, i, e, with, altitude, or, because, the, earth, s, shape, is, oblate, g, varies, with, latitude, a, more, important, cause, of, this, reduction, in, g, at, the, equator, is, because, the, equator, is, spinning, at, one, revolution, per, day, so, the, acceleration, by, the, gravitational, force, is, partially, canceled, there, by, the, centrifugal, force
