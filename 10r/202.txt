an, electric, light, lamp, or, light, bulb, is, an, electrical, component, that, produces, light, it, is, the, most, common, form, of, artificial, lighting, lamps, usually, have, a, base, made, of, ceramic, metal, glass, or, plastic, which, secures, the, lamp, in, the, socket, of, a, light, fixture, which, is, often, called, a, lamp, as, well, the, electrical, connection, to, the, socket, may, be, made, with, a, screw, thread, base, two, metal, pins, two, metal, caps, or, a, bayonet, mount, the, three, main, categories, of, electric, lights, are, incandescent, lamps, which, produce, light, by, a, filament, heated, white, hot, by, electric, current, gas, discharge, lamps, which, produce, light, by, means, of, an, electric, arc, through, a, gas, such, as, fluorescent, lamps, and, led, lamps, which, produce, light, by, a, flow, of, electrons, across, a, band, gap, in, a, semiconductor, the, energy, efficiency, of, electric, lighting, has, increased, radically, since, the, first, demonstration, of, arc, lamps, and, the, incandescent, light, bulb, of, the, 19th, century, modern, electric, light, sources, come, in, a, profusion, of, types, and, sizes, adapted, to, many, applications, most, modern, electric, lighting, is, powered, by, centrally, generated, electric, power, but, lighting, may, also, be, powered, by, mobile, or, standby, electric, generators, or, battery, systems, battery, powered, light, is, often, reserved, for, when, and, where, stationary, lights, fail, often, in, the, form, of, flashlights, or, electric, lanterns, as, well, as, in, vehicles, before, electric, lighting, became, common, in, the, early, 20th, century, people, used, candles, gas, lights, oil, lamps, and, fires, in, 1799, 1800, alessandro, volta, created, the, voltaic, pile, the, first, electric, battery, current, from, these, batteries, could, heat, copper, wire, to, incandescence, vasily, vladimirovich, petrov, developed, the, first, persistent, electric, arc, in, 1802, and, english, chemist, humphry, davy, gave, a, practical, demonstration, of, an, arc, light, in, 1806, it, took, more, than, a, century, of, continuous, and, incremental, improvement, including, numerous, designs, patents, and, resulting, intellectual, property, disputes, to, get, from, these, early, experiments, to, commercially, produced, incandescent, light, bulbs, in, the, 1920s, in, 1840, warren, de, la, rue, enclosed, a, platinum, coil, in, a, vacuum, tube, and, passed, an, electric, current, through, it, thus, creating, one, of, the, world, s, first, electric, light, bulbs, the, design, was, based, on, the, concept, that, the, high, melting, point, of, platinum, would, allow, it, to, operate, at, high, temperatures, and, that, the, evacuated, chamber, would, contain, fewer, gas, molecules, to, react, with, the, platinum, improving, its, longevity, although, it, was, an, efficient, design, the, cost, of, the, platinum, made, it, impractical, for, commercial, use, william, greener, an, english, inventor, made, significant, contributions, to, early, electric, lighting, with, his, lamp, in, 1846, patent, specification, 11076, laying, the, groundwork, for, future, innovations, such, as, those, by, thomas, edison, the, late, 1870s, and, 1880s, were, marked, by, intense, competition, and, innovation, with, inventors, like, joseph, swan, in, the, uk, and, thomas, edison, in, the, us, independently, developing, functional, incandescent, lamps, swan, s, bulbs, based, on, designs, by, william, staite, were, successful, but, the, filaments, were, too, thick, edison, worked, to, create, bulbs, with, thinner, filaments, leading, to, a, better, design, the, rivalry, between, swan, and, edison, eventually, led, to, a, merger, forming, the, edison, and, swan, electric, light, company, by, the, early, twentieth, century, these, had, completely, replaced, arc, lamps, the, turn, of, the, century, saw, further, improvements, in, bulb, longevity, and, efficiency, notably, with, the, introduction, of, the, tungsten, filament, by, william, d, coolidge, who, applied, for, a, patent, in, 1912, this, innovation, became, a, standard, for, incandescent, bulbs, for, many, years, in, 1910, georges, claude, introduced, the, first, neon, light, paving, the, way, for, neon, signs, which, would, become, ubiquitous, in, advertising, in, 1934, arthur, compton, a, renowned, physicist, and, ge, consultant, reported, to, the, ge, lamp, department, on, successful, experiments, with, fluorescent, lighting, at, general, electric, co, ltd, in, great, britain, unrelated, to, general, electric, in, the, united, states, stimulated, by, this, report, and, with, all, of, the, key, elements, available, a, team, led, by, george, e, inman, built, a, prototype, fluorescent, lamp, in, 1934, at, general, electric, s, nela, park, ohio, engineering, laboratory, this, was, not, a, trivial, exercise, as, noted, by, arthur, a, bright, a, great, deal, of, experimentation, had, to, be, done, on, lamp, sizes, and, shapes, cathode, construction, gas, pressures, of, both, argon, and, mercury, vapor, colors, of, fluorescent, powders, methods, of, attaching, them, to, the, inside, of, the, tube, and, other, details, of, the, lamp, and, its, auxiliaries, before, the, new, device, was, ready, for, the, public, the, first, practical, led, arrived, in, 1962, in, the, united, states, incandescent, light, bulbs, including, halogen, bulbs, stopped, being, sold, as, of, august, 1, 2023, because, they, do, not, meet, minimum, lumens, per, watt, performance, metrics, established, by, the, u, s, department, of, energy, compact, fluorescent, bulbs, are, also, banned, despite, their, lumens, per, watt, performance, because, of, their, toxic, mercury, that, can, be, released, into, the, home, if, broken, and, widespread, problems, with, proper, disposal, of, mercury, containing, bulbs, in, its, modern, form, the, incandescent, light, bulb, consists, of, a, coiled, filament, of, tungsten, sealed, in, a, globular, glass, chamber, either, a, vacuum, or, full, of, an, inert, gas, such, as, argon, when, an, electric, current, is, connected, the, tungsten, is, heated, to, 2, 000, to, 3, 300, k, 1, 730, to, 3, 030, c, 3, 140, to, 5, 480, f, and, glows, emitting, light, that, approximates, a, continuous, spectrum, incandescent, bulbs, are, highly, inefficient, in, that, just, 2, 5, of, the, energy, consumed, is, emitted, as, visible, usable, light, the, remaining, 95, is, lost, as, heat, in, warmer, climates, the, emitted, heat, must, then, be, removed, putting, additional, pressure, on, ventilation, or, air, conditioning, systems, in, colder, weather, the, heat, byproduct, has, some, value, and, has, been, successfully, harnessed, for, warming, in, devices, such, as, heat, lamps, incandescent, bulbs, are, nonetheless, being, phased, out, in, favor, of, technologies, like, cfls, and, led, bulbs, in, many, countries, due, to, their, low, energy, efficiency, the, european, commission, estimated, in, 2012, that, a, complete, ban, on, incandescent, bulbs, would, contribute, 5, to, 10, billion, euros, to, the, economy, and, save, 15, billion, metric, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, halogen, lamps, are, usually, much, smaller, than, standard, incandescent, lamps, because, for, successful, operation, a, bulb, temperature, over, 200, c, is, generally, necessary, for, this, reason, most, have, a, bulb, of, fused, silica, quartz, or, aluminosilicate, glass, this, is, often, sealed, inside, an, additional, layer, of, glass, the, outer, glass, is, a, safety, precaution, to, reduce, ultraviolet, emission, and, to, contain, hot, glass, shards, should, the, inner, envelope, explode, during, operation, oily, residue, from, fingerprints, may, cause, a, hot, quartz, envelope, to, shatter, due, to, excessive, heat, buildup, at, the, contamination, site, the, risk, of, burns, or, fire, is, also, greater, with, bare, bulbs, leading, to, their, prohibition, in, some, places, unless, enclosed, by, the, luminaire, those, designed, for, 12, or, 24, volt, operation, have, compact, filaments, useful, for, good, optical, control, also, they, have, higher, efficacies, lumens, per, watt, and, longer, lives, than, non, halogen, types, the, light, output, remains, almost, constant, throughout, their, life, fluorescent, lamps, consist, of, a, glass, tube, that, contains, mercury, vapour, or, argon, under, low, pressure, electricity, flowing, through, the, tube, causes, the, gases, to, give, off, ultraviolet, energy, the, inside, of, the, tubes, are, coated, with, phosphors, that, give, off, visible, light, when, struck, by, ultraviolet, photons, they, have, much, higher, efficiency, than, incandescent, lamps, for, the, same, amount, of, light, generated, they, typically, use, around, one, quarter, to, one, third, the, power, of, an, incandescent, the, typical, luminous, efficacy, of, fluorescent, lighting, systems, is, 50, 100, lumens, per, watt, several, times, the, efficacy, of, incandescent, bulbs, with, comparable, light, output, fluorescent, lamp, fixtures, are, more, costly, than, incandescent, lamps, because, they, require, a, ballast, to, regulate, the, current, through, the, lamp, but, the, lower, energy, cost, typically, offsets, the, higher, initial, cost, compact, fluorescent, lamps, are, available, in, the, same, popular, sizes, as, incandescent, lamps, and, are, used, as, an, energy, saving, alternative, in, homes, because, they, contain, mercury, many, fluorescent, lamps, are, classified, as, hazardous, waste, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, recommends, that, fluorescent, lamps, be, segregated, from, general, waste, for, recycling, or, safe, disposal, and, some, jurisdictions, require, recycling, of, them, the, solid, state, light, emitting, diode, led, has, been, popular, as, an, indicator, light, in, consumer, electronics, and, professional, audio, gear, since, the, 1970s, in, the, 2000s, efficacy, and, output, have, risen, to, the, point, where, leds, are, now, being, used, in, lighting, applications, such, as, car, headlights, and, brake, lights, in, flashlights, and, bicycle, lights, as, well, as, in, decorative, applications, such, as, holiday, lighting, indicator, leds, are, known, for, their, extremely, long, life, up, to, 100, 000, hours, but, lighting, leds, are, operated, much, less, conservatively, and, consequently, have, shorter, lives, led, technology, is, useful, for, lighting, designers, because, of, its, low, power, consumption, low, heat, generation, instantaneous, on, off, control, and, in, the, case, of, single, color, leds, continuity, of, color, throughout, the, life, of, the, diode, and, relatively, low, cost, of, manufacture, led, lifetime, depends, strongly, on, the, temperature, of, the, diode, operating, an, led, lamp, in, conditions, that, increase, the, internal, temperature, can, greatly, shorten, the, lamp, s, life, some, lasers, have, been, adapted, as, an, alternative, to, leds, to, provide, highly, focused, illumination, carbon, arc, lamps, consist, of, two, carbon, rod, electrodes, in, open, air, supplied, by, a, current, limiting, ballast, the, electric, arc, is, struck, by, touching, the, rod, tips, then, separating, them, the, ensuing, arc, produces, a, white, hot, plasma, between, the, rod, tips, these, lamps, have, higher, efficacy, than, filament, lamps, but, the, carbon, rods, are, short, lived, and, require, constant, adjustment, in, use, as, the, intense, heat, of, the, arc, erodes, them, the, lamps, produce, significant, ultraviolet, output, they, require, ventilation, when, used, indoors, and, due, to, their, intensity, they, need, protection, from, direct, sight, invented, by, humphry, davy, around, 1805, the, carbon, arc, was, the, first, practical, electric, light, it, was, used, commercially, beginning, in, the, 1870s, for, large, building, and, street, lighting, until, it, was, superseded, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, the, incandescent, light, carbon, arc, lamps, operate, at, high, power, and, produce, high, intensity, white, light, they, also, are, a, point, source, of, light, they, remained, in, use, in, limited, applications, that, required, these, properties, such, as, movie, projectors, stage, lighting, and, searchlights, until, after, world, war, ii, a, discharge, lamp, has, a, glass, or, silica, envelope, containing, two, metal, electrodes, separated, by, a, gas, gases, used, include, neon, argon, xenon, sodium, metal, halides, and, mercury, the, core, operating, principle, is, much, the, same, as, the, carbon, arc, lamp, but, the, term, arc, lamp, normally, refers, to, carbon, arc, lamps, with, more, modern, types, of, gas, discharge, lamp, normally, called, discharge, lamps, with, some, discharge, lamps, very, high, voltage, is, used, to, strike, the, arc, this, requires, an, electrical, circuit, called, an, igniter, which, is, part, of, the, electrical, ballast, circuitry, after, the, arc, is, struck, the, internal, resistance, of, the, lamp, drops, to, a, low, level, and, the, ballast, limits, the, current, to, the, operating, current, without, a, ballast, excess, current, would, flow, causing, rapid, destruction, of, the, lamp, some, lamp, types, contain, a, small, amount, of, neon, which, permits, striking, at, normal, running, voltage, with, no, external, ignition, circuitry, low, pressure, sodium, lamps, operate, this, way, the, simplest, ballasts, are, just, an, inductor, and, are, chosen, where, cost, is, the, deciding, factor, such, as, street, lighting, more, advanced, electronic, ballasts, may, be, designed, to, maintain, constant, light, output, over, the, life, of, the, lamp, may, drive, the, lamp, with, a, square, wave, to, maintain, completely, flicker, free, output, and, shut, down, in, the, event, of, certain, faults, the, most, efficient, source, of, electric, light, is, the, low, pressure, sodium, lamp, it, produces, for, all, practical, purposes, a, monochromatic, orange, yellow, light, which, gives, a, similarly, monochromatic, perception, of, any, illuminated, scene, for, this, reason, it, is, generally, reserved, for, outdoor, public, lighting, applications, low, pressure, sodium, lights, are, favoured, for, public, lighting, by, astronomers, since, the, light, pollution, that, they, generate, can, be, easily, filtered, contrary, to, broadband, or, continuous, spectra, many, lamp, units, or, light, bulbs, are, specified, in, standardized, shape, codes, and, socket, names, incandescent, bulbs, and, their, retrofit, replacements, are, often, specified, as, a19, a60, e26, e27, a, common, size, for, those, kinds, of, light, bulbs, in, this, example, the, a, parameters, describe, the, bulb, size, and, shape, within, the, a, series, light, bulb, while, the, e, parameters, describe, the, edison, screw, base, size, and, thread, characteristics, common, comparison, parameters, include, less, common, parameters, include, color, rendering, index, cri, life, expectancy, for, many, types, of, lamp, is, defined, as, the, number, of, hours, of, operation, at, which, 50, of, them, fail, that, is, the, median, life, of, the, lamps, production, tolerances, as, low, as, 1, can, create, a, variance, of, 25, in, lamp, life, so, in, general, some, lamps, will, fail, well, before, the, rated, life, expectancy, and, some, will, last, much, longer, for, leds, lamp, life, is, defined, as, the, operation, time, at, which, 50, of, lamps, have, experienced, a, 70, decrease, in, light, output, in, the, 1900s, the, phoebus, cartel, formed, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, life, of, electric, light, bulbs, an, example, of, planned, obsolescence, some, types, of, lamp, are, also, sensitive, to, switching, cycles, rooms, with, frequent, switching, such, as, bathrooms, can, expect, much, shorter, lamp, life, than, what, is, printed, on, the, box, compact, fluorescent, lamps, are, particularly, sensitive, to, switching, cycles, the, total, amount, of, artificial, light, especially, from, street, light, is, sufficient, for, cities, to, be, easily, visible, at, night, from, the, air, and, from, space, external, lighting, grew, at, a, rate, of, 3, 6, percent, for, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, is, the, major, source, of, light, pollution, that, burdens, astronomers, and, others, with, 80, of, the, world, s, population, living, in, areas, with, night, time, light, pollution, light, pollution, has, been, shown, to, have, a, negative, effect, on, some, wildlife, electric, lamps, can, be, used, as, heat, sources, for, example, in, incubators, as, infrared, lamps, in, fast, food, restaurants, and, toys, such, as, the, kenner, easy, bake, oven, lamps, can, also, be, used, for, light, therapy, to, deal, with, such, issues, as, vitamin, d, deficiency, skin, conditions, such, as, acne, and, dermatitis, skin, cancers, and, seasonal, affective, disorder, lamps, which, emit, a, specific, frequency, of, blue, light, are, also, used, to, treat, neonatal, jaundice, with, the, treatment, which, was, initially, undertaken, in, hospitals, being, able, to, be, conducted, at, home, electric, lamps, can, also, be, used, as, a, grow, light, to, aid, in, plant, growth, especially, in, indoor, hydroponics, and, aquatic, plants, with, recent, research, into, the, most, effective, types, of, light, for, plant, growth, due, to, their, nonlinear, resistance, characteristics, tungsten, filament, lamps, have, long, been, used, as, fast, acting, thermistors, in, electronic, circuits, popular, uses, have, included, in, western, culture, a, lightbulb, in, particular, the, appearance, of, an, illuminated, lightbulb, above, a, person, s, head, signifies, sudden, inspiration, in, the, middle, east, a, light, bulb, symbol, has, a, sexual, connotation, a, stylized, depiction, of, a, light, bulb, features, as, the, logo, of, the, turkish, ak, party
