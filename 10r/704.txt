service, in, the, world, the, airline, soon, gained, a, reputation, for, reliability, despite, problems, with, bad, weather, and, began, to, attract, european, competition, in, november, 1919, it, won, the, first, british, civil, airmail, contract, six, royal, air, force, airco, dh, 9a, aircraft, were, lent, to, the, company, to, operate, the, airmail, service, between, hawkinge, and, cologne,

and, nizhni, novgorod, since, 1932, all, operations, had, been, carried, under, the, name, aeroflot, early, european, airlines, tended, to, favor, comfort, the, passenger, cabins, were, often, spacious, with, luxurious, interiors, over, speed, and, efficiency, the, relatively, basic, navigational, capabilities, of, pilots, at, the, time, also, meant, that, delays, due, to, the, weather, were, commonplace, by, the, early, 1920s, small, airlines, were, struggling, to, compete, and, there, was, a, movement, towards, increased, rationalization, and, consolidation, in, 1924, imperial, airways, was, formed, from, the, merger, of, instone, air, line, company, british, marine, air, navigation, daimler, airway, and, handley, page, transport, to, allow, british, airlines, to, compete, with, stiff, competition, from, french, and, german, airlines, that, were, enjoying, heavy, government, subsidies, the, airline, was, a, pioneer, in, surveying, and, opening, up, air, routes, across, the, world, to, serve, far, flung, parts, of, the, british, empire, and, to, enhance, trade, and, integration, the, first, new, airliner, ordered, by, imperial, airways, was, the, handley, page, w8f,

form, air, union, on, 1, january, 1923, this, later, merged, with, four, other, french, airlines, to, become, air, france, the, country, s, flagship, carrier, to, this, day, on, 17, may, 1933, germany, s, deutsche, lufthansa, was, created, in, 1926, by, merger, of, two, airlines, one, of, them, junkers, luftverkehr, lufthansa, due, to, the, junkers, heritage, and, unlike, most, other, airlines, at, the, time, became, a, major, investor, in, airlines, outside, of, europe, providing, capital, to, varig, and, avianca, german, airliners, built, by, junkers, dornier, and, fokker, were, among, the, most, advanced, in, the, world, at, the, time, in, 1926, alan, cobham, surveyed, a, flight, route, from, the, uk, to, cape, town, south, africa, following, this, up, with, another, proving, flight, to, melbourne, australia, other, routes, to, british, india, and, the, far, east, were, also, charted, and, demonstrated, at, this, time, regular, services, to, cairo, and, basra, began, in, 1927, and, were, extended, to, karachi, in, 1929, the, london, australia, service, was, inaugurated, in, 1932, with, the, handley, page, hp, 42, airliners, further, services, were, opened, up, to, calcutta, rangoon, singapore, brisbane, and, hong, kong, passengers, departed, london, on, 14, march, 1936, following, the, establishment, of, a, branch, from, penang, to, hong, kong, france, began, an, air, mail, service, to, morocco, in, 1919, that, was, bought, out, in, 1927, renamed, a, ropostale, and, injected, with, capital, to, become, a, major, international, carrier, in, 1933, a, ropostale, went, bankrupt, was, nationalized, and, merged, into, air, france, although, germany, lacked, colonies, it, also, began, expanding, its, services, globally, in, 1931, the, airship, graf, zeppelin, began, offering, regular, scheduled, passenger, service, between, germany, and, south, america, usually, every, two, weeks, which, continued, until, 1937, in, 1936, the, airship, hindenburg, entered, passenger, service, and, successfully, crossed, the, atlantic, 36, times, before, crashing, at, lakehurst, new, jersey, on, 6, may, 1937, in, 1938, a, weekly, air, service, from, berlin, to, kabul, afghanistan, started, operating, from, february, 1934, until, world, war, ii, began, in, 1939, deutsche, lufthansa, operated, an, airmail, service, from, stuttgart, germany, via, spain, the, canary, islands, and, west, africa, to, natal, in, brazil, this, was, the, first, time, an, airline, flew, across, an, ocean, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, aeroflot, had, become, the, world, s, largest, airline, employing, more, than, 4, 000, pilots, and, 60, 000, other, service, personnel, and, operating, around, 3, 000, aircraft, of, which, 75, were, considered, obsolete, by, its, own, standards, during, the, soviet, era, aeroflot, was, synonymous, with, russian, civil, aviation, as, it, was, the, only, air, carrier, it, became, the, first, airline, in, the, world, to, operate, sustained, regular, jet, services, on, 15, september, 1956, with, the, tupolev, tu, 104, deregulation, of, the, european, union, airspace, in, the, early, 1990s, has, had, substantial, effect, on, the, structure, of, the, industry, there, the, shift, towards, budget, airlines, on, shorter, routes, has, been, significant, airlines, such, as, easyjet, and, ryanair, have, often, grown, at, the, expense, of, the, traditional, national, airlines, there, has, also, been, a, trend, for, these, national, airlines, themselves, to, be, privatized, such, as, has, occurred, for, aer, lingus, and, british, airways, other, national, airlines, including, italy, s, alitalia, suffered, particularly, with, the, rapid, increase, of, oil, prices, in, early, 2008, finnair, the, largest, airline, of, finland, had, no, fatal, or, hull, loss, accidents, since, 1963, and, is, recognized, for, its, safety, tony, jannus, conducted, the, united, states, first, scheduled, commercial, airline, flight, on, january, 1, 1914, for, the, st, petersburg, tampa, airboat, line, the, 23, minute, flight, traveled, between, st, petersburg, florida, and, tampa, florida, passing, some, 50, feet, 15, m, above, tampa, bay, in, jannus, benoist, xiv, wood, and, muslin, biplane, flying, boat, his, passenger, was, a, former, mayor, of, st, petersburg, who, paid, 400, for, the, privilege, of, sitting, on, a, wooden, bench, in, the, open, cockpit, the, airboat, line, operated, for, about, four, months, carrying, more, than, 1, 200, passengers, who, paid, 5, each, chalk, s, international, airlines, began, service, between, miami, and, bimini, in, the, bahamas, in, february, 1919, based, in, ft, lauderdale, chalk, s, claimed, to, be, the, oldest, continuously, operating, airline, in, the, united, states, until, its, closure, in, 2008, following, world, war, i, the, united, states, found, itself, swamped, with, aviators, many, decided, to, take, their, war, surplus, aircraft, on, barnstorming, campaigns, performing, aerobatic, maneuvers, to, woo, crowds, in, 1918, the, united, states, postal, service, won, the, financial, backing, of, congress, to, begin, experimenting, with, air, mail, service, initially, using, curtiss, jenny, aircraft, that, had, been, procured, by, the, united, states, army, air, service, private, operators, were, the, first, to, fly, the, mail, but, due, to, numerous, accidents, the, us, army, was, tasked, with, mail, delivery, during, the, army, s, involvement, they, proved, to, be, too, unreliable, and, lost, their, air, mail, duties, by, the, mid, 1920s, the, postal, service, had, developed, its, own, air, mail, network, based, on, a, transcontinental, backbone, between, new, york, city, and, san, francisco, to, supplement, this, service, they, offered, twelve, contracts, for, spur, routes, to, independent, bidders, some, of, the, carriers, that, won, these, routes, would, through, time, and, mergers, evolve, into, pan, am, delta, air, lines, braniff, airways, american, airlines, united, airlines, originally, a, division, of, boeing, trans, world, airlines, northwest, airlines, and, eastern, air, lines, service, during, the, early, 1920s, was, sporadic, most, airlines, at, the, time, were, focused, on, carrying, bags, of, mail, in, 1925, however, the, ford, motor, company, bought, out, the, stout, aircraft, company, and, began, construction, of, the, all, metal, ford, trimotor, which, became, the, first, successful, american, airliner, with, a, 12, passenger, capacity, the, trimotor, made, passenger, service, potentially, profitable, air, service, was, seen, as, a, supplement, to, rail, service, in, the, american, transportation, network, at, the, same, time, juan, trippe, began, a, crusade, to, create, an, air, network, that, would, link, america, to, the, world, and, he, achieved, this, goal, through, his, airline, pan, am, with, a, fleet, of, flying, boats, that, linked, los, angeles, to, shanghai, and, boston, to, london, pan, am, and, northwest, airways, which, began, flights, to, canada, in, the, 1920s, were, the, only, u, s, airlines, to, go, international, before, the, 1940s, with, the, introduction, of, the, boeing, 247, and, douglas, dc, 3, in, the, 1930s, the, u, s, airline, industry, was, generally, profitable, even, during, the, great, depression, this, trend, continued, until, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, world, war, ii, like, world, war, i, brought, new, life, to, the, airline, industry, many, airlines, in, the, allied, countries, were, flush, from, lease, contracts, to, the, military, and, foresaw, a, future, explosive, demand, for, civil, air, transport, for, both, passengers, and, cargo, they, were, eager, to, invest, in, the, newly, emerging, flagships, of, air, travel, such, as, the, boeing, stratocruiser, lockheed, constellation, and, douglas, dc, 6, most, of, these, new, aircraft, were, based, on, american, bombers, such, as, the, b, 29, which, had, spearheaded, research, into, new, technologies, such, as, pressurization, most, offered, increased, efficiency, from, both, added, speed, and, greater, payload, in, the, 1950s, the, de, havilland, comet, boeing, 707, douglas, dc, 8, and, sud, aviation, caravelle, became, the, first, flagships, of, the, jet, age, in, the, west, while, the, eastern, bloc, had, tupolev, tu, 104, and, tupolev, tu, 124, in, the, fleets, of, state, owned, carriers, such, as, czechoslovak, sa, soviet, aeroflot, and, east, german, interflug, the, vickers, viscount, and, lockheed, l, 188, electra, inaugurated, turboprop, transport, on, 4, october, 1958, british, overseas, airways, corporation, started, transatlantic, flights, between, london, heathrow, and, new, york, idlewild, with, a, comet, 4, and, pan, am, followed, on, 26, october, with, a, boeing, 707, service, between, new, york, and, paris, the, next, big, boost, for, the, airlines, would, come, in, the, 1970s, when, the, boeing, 747, mcdonnell, douglas, dc, 10, and, lockheed, l, 1011, inaugurated, widebody, jumbo, jet, service, which, is, still, the, standard, in, international, travel, the, tupolev, tu, 144, and, its, western, counterpart, concorde, made, supersonic, travel, a, reality, concorde, first, flew, in, 1969, and, operated, through, 2003, in, 1972, airbus, began, producing, europe, s, most, commercially, successful, line, of, airliners, to, date, the, added, efficiencies, for, these, aircraft, were, often, not, in, speed, but, in, passenger, capacity, payload, and, range, airbus, also, features, modern, electronic, cockpits, that, were, common, across, their, aircraft, to, enable, pilots, to, fly, multiple, models, with, minimal, cross, training, the, 1978, u, s, airline, industry, deregulation, lowered, federally, controlled, barriers, for, new, airlines, just, as, a, downturn, in, the, nation, s, economy, occurred, new, start, ups, entered, during, the, downturn, during, which, time, they, found, aircraft, and, funding, contracted, hangar, and, maintenance, services, trained, new, employees, and, recruited, laid, off, staff, from, other, airlines, major, airlines, dominated, their, routes, through, aggressive, pricing, and, additional, capacity, offerings, often, swamping, new, start, ups, in, the, place, of, high, barriers, to, entry, imposed, by, regulation, the, major, airlines, implemented, an, equally, high, barrier, called, loss, leader, pricing, in, this, strategy, an, already, established, and, dominant, airline, stomps, out, its, competition, by, lowering, airfares, on, specific, routes, below, the, cost, of, operating, on, it, choking, out, any, chance, a, start, up, airline, may, have, the, industry, side, effect, is, an, overall, drop, in, revenue, and, service, quality, since, deregulation, in, 1978, the, average, domestic, ticket, price, has, dropped, by, 40, so, has, airline, employee, pay, by, incurring, massive, losses, the, airlines, of, the, usa, now, rely, upon, a, scourge, of, cyclical, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, proceedings, to, continue, doing, business, america, west, airlines, which, has, since, merged, with, us, airways, remained, a, significant, survivor, from, this, new, entrant, era, as, dozens, even, hundreds, have, gone, under, in, many, ways, the, biggest, winner, in, the, deregulated, environment, was, the, air, passenger, although, not, exclusively, attributable, to, deregulation, indeed, the, u, s, witnessed, an, explosive, growth, in, demand, for, air, travel, many, millions, who, had, never, or, rarely, flown, before, became, regular, fliers, even, joining, frequent, flyer, loyalty, programs, and, receiving, free, flights, and, other, benefits, from, their, flying, new, services, and, higher, frequencies, meant, that, business, fliers, could, fly, to, another, city, do, business, and, return, the, same, day, from, almost, any, point, in, the, country, air, travel, s, advantages, put, long, distance, intercity, railroad, travel, and, bus, lines, under, pressure, with, most, of, the, latter, having, withered, away, whilst, the, former, is, still, protected, under, nationalization, through, the, continuing, existence, of, amtrak, by, the, 1980s, almost, half, of, the, total, flying, in, the, world, took, place, in, the, u, s, and, today, the, domestic, industry, operates, over, 10, 000, daily, departures, nationwide, toward, the, end, of, the, century, a, new, style, of, low, cost, airline, emerged, offering, a, no, frills, product, at, a, lower, price, southwest, airlines, jetblue, airtran, airways, skybus, airlines, and, other, low, cost, carriers, began, to, represent, a, serious, challenge, to, the, so, called, legacy, airlines, as, did, their, low, cost, counterparts, in, many, other, countries, their, commercial, viability, represented, a, serious, competitive, threat, to, the, legacy, carriers, however, of, these, ata, and, skybus, have, since, ceased, operations, increasingly, since, 1978, us, airlines, have, been, reincorporated, and, spun, off, by, newly, created, and, internally, led, management, companies, and, thus, becoming, nothing, more, than, operating, units, and, subsidiaries, with, limited, financially, decisive, control, among, some, of, these, holding, companies, and, parent, companies, which, are, relatively, well, known, are, the, ual, corporation, along, with, the, amr, corporation, among, a, long, list, of, airline, holding, companies, sometime, recognized, worldwide, less, recognized, are, the, private, equity, firms, which, often, seize, managerial, financial, and, board, of, directors, control, of, distressed, airline, companies, by, temporarily, investing, large, sums, of, capital, in, air, carriers, to, rescheme, an, airlines, assets, into, a, profitable, organization, or, liquidating, an, air, carrier, of, their, profitable, and, worthwhile, routes, and, business, operations, thus, the, last, 50, years, of, the, airline, industry, have, varied, from, reasonably, profitable, to, devastatingly, depressed, as, the, first, major, market, to, deregulate, the, industry, in, 1978, u, s, airlines, have, experienced, more, turbulence, than, almost, any, other, country, or, region, in, fact, no, u, s, legacy, carrier, survived, bankruptcy, free, among, the, outspoken, critics, of, deregulation, former, ceo, of, american, airlines, robert, crandall, has, publicly, stated, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, protection, filing, shows, airline, industry, deregulation, was, a, mistake, congress, passed, the, air, transportation, safety, and, system, stabilization, act, p, l, 107, 42, in, response, to, a, severe, liquidity, crisis, facing, the, already, troubled, airline, industry, in, the, aftermath, of, the, september, 11, attacks, through, the, atsb, congress, sought, to, provide, cash, infusions, to, carriers, for, both, the, cost, of, the, four, day, federal, shutdown, of, the, airlines, and, the, incremental, losses, incurred, through, december, 31, 2001, as, a, result, of, the, terrorist, attacks, this, resulted, in, the, first, government, bailout, of, the, 21st, century, between, 2000, and, 2005, us, airlines, lost, 30, billion, with, wage, cuts, of, over, 15, billion, and, 100, 000, employees, laid, off, in, recognition, of, the, essential, national, economic, role, of, a, healthy, aviation, system, congress, authorized, partial, compensation, of, up, to, 5, billion, in, cash, subject, to, review, by, the, u, s, department, of, transportation, and, up, to, 10, billion, in, loan, guarantees, subject, to, review, by, a, newly, created, air, transportation, stabilization, board, atsb, the, applications, to, dot, for, reimbursements, were, subjected, to, rigorous, multi, year, reviews, not, only, by, dot, program, personnel, but, also, by, the, government, accountability, office, and, the, dot, inspector, general, ultimately, the, federal, government, provided, 4, 6, billion, in, one, time, subject, to, income, tax, cash, payments, to, 427, u, s, air, carriers, with, no, provision, for, repayment, essentially, a, gift, from, the, taxpayers, passenger, carriers, operating, scheduled, service, received, approximately, 4, billion, subject, to, tax, in, addition, the, atsb, approved, loan, guarantees, to, six, airlines, totaling, approximately, 1, 6, billion, data, from, the, u, s, treasury, department, show, that, the, government, recouped, the, 1, 6, billion, and, a, profit, of, 339, million, from, the, fees, interest, and, purchase, of, discounted,

1939, upon, the, advice, of, general, douglas, macarthur, and, later, merged, with, newly, formed, philippine, airlines, with, pal, as, the, surviving, entity, soriano, has, controlling, interest, in, both, airlines, before, the, merger, pal, restarted, service, on, 15, march, 1941, with, a, single, beech, model, 18, npc, 54, aircraft, which, started, its, daily, services, between, manila, from,

other, asian, countries, in, 1946, along, with, asiana, airlines, which, later, joined, in, 1988, the, license, to, operate, as, an, airliner, was, granted, by, the, federal, government, body, after,

colombia, and, viva, air, peru, many, countries, have, national, airlines, that, the, government, owns, and, operates, fully, private, airlines, are, subject, to, much, government, regulation, for, economic, political, and, safety, concerns, for, instance, governments, often, intervene, to, halt, airline, labor, actions, to, protect, the, free, flow, of, people, communications, and, goods, between, different, regions, without, compromising, safety, the, united, states, australia, and, to, a, lesser, extent, brazil, mexico, india, the, united, kingdom, and, japan, have, deregulated, their, airlines, in, the, past, these, governments, dictated, airfares, route, networks, and, other, operational, requirements, for, each, airline, since, deregulation, airlines, have, been, largely, free, to, negotiate, their, own, operating, arrangements, with, different, airports, enter, and, exit, routes, easily, and, to, levy, airfares, and, supply, flights, according, to, market, demand, the, entry, barriers, for, new, airlines, are, lower, in, a, deregulated, market, and, so, the, u, s, has, seen, hundreds, of, airlines, start, up, sometimes, for, only, a, brief, operating, period, this, has, produced, far, greater, competition, than, before, deregulation, in, most, markets, the, added, competition, together, with, pricing, freedom, means, that, new, entrants, often, take, market, share, with, highly, reduced, rates, that, to, a, limited, degree, full, service, airlines, must, match, this, is, a, major, constraint, on, profitability, for, established, carriers, which, tend, to, have, a, higher, cost, base, as, a, result, profitability, in, a, deregulated, market, is, uneven, for, most, airlines, these, forces, have, caused, some, major, airlines, to, go, out, of, business, in, addition, to, most, of, the, poorly, established, new, entrants, in, the, united, states, the, airline, industry, is, dominated, by, four, large, firms, because, of, industry, consolidation, after, fuel, prices, dropped, considerably, in, 2015, very, little, of, the, savings, were, passed, on, to, consumers, groups, such, as, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, establish, worldwide, standards, for, safety, and, other, vital, concerns, most, international, air, traffic, is, regulated, by, bilateral, agreements, between, countries, which, designate, specific, carriers, to, operate, on, specific, routes, the, model, of, such, an, agreement, was, the, bermuda, agreement, between, the, us, and, uk, following, world, war, ii, which, designated, airports, to, be, used, for, transatlantic, flights, and, gave, each, government, the, authority, to, nominate, carriers, to, operate, routes, bilateral, agreements, are, based, on, the, freedoms, of, the, air, a, group, of, generalized, traffic, rights, ranging, from, the, freedom, to, overfly, a, country, to, the, freedom, to, provide, domestic, flights, within, a, country, a, very, rarely, granted, right, known, as, cabotage, most, agreements, permit, airlines, to, fly, from, their, home, country, to, designated, airports, in, the, other, country, some, also, extend, the, freedom, to, provide, continuing, service, to, a, third, country, or, to, another, destination, in, the, other, country, while, carrying, passengers, from, overseas, in, the, 1990s, open, skies, agreements, became, more, common, these, agreements, take, many, of, these, regulatory, powers, from, state, governments, and, open, up, international, routes, to, further, competition, open, skies, agreements, have, met, some, criticism, particularly, within, the, european, union, whose, airlines, would, be, at, a, comparative, disadvantage, with, the, united, states, because, of, cabotage, restrictions, in, 2017, 4, 1, billion, passengers, have, been, carried, by, airlines, in, 41, 9, million, commercial, scheduled, flights, an, average, payload, of, 98, passengers, for, 7, 75,

latin, america, and, 5, 4bn, in, africa, airlines, have, substantial, fixed, and, operating, costs, to, establish, and, maintain, air, services, labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares, and, parts, it, services, and, networks, airport, equipment, airport, handling, services, booking, commissions, advertising, catering, training, aviation, insurance, and, other, costs, thus, all, but, a, small, percentage, of, the, income, from, ticket, sales, is, paid, out, to, a, wide, variety, of, external, providers, or, internal, cost, centers, moreover, the, industry, is, structured, so, that, airlines, often, act, as, tax, collectors, airline, fuel, is, untaxed, because, of, a, series, of, treaties, existing, between, countries, ticket, prices, include, a, number, of, fees, taxes, and, surcharges, beyond, the, control, of, airlines, airlines, are, also, responsible, for, enforcing, government, regulations, if, airlines, carry, passengers, without, proper, documentation, on, an, international, flight, they, are, responsible, for, returning, them, back, to, the, original, country, analysis, of, the, 1992, 1996, period, shows, that, every, player, in, the, air, transport, chain, is, far, more, profitable, than, the, airlines, who, collect, and, pass, through, fees, and, revenues, to, them, from, ticket, sales, while, airlines, as, a, whole, earned, 6, return, on,

global, distribution, companies, more, than, 30, there, has, been, continuing, cost, competition, from, low, cost, airlines, many, companies, emulate, southwest, airlines, in, various, respects, the, lines, between, full, service, and, low, cost, airlines, have, become, blurred, e, g, with, most, full, service, airlines, introducing, baggage, check, fees, despite, southwest, not, doing, so, many, airlines, in, the, u, s, and, elsewhere, have, experienced, business, difficulty, u, s, airlines, that, have, declared, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, since, 1990, have, included, american, airlines, continental, airlines, twice, delta, air, lines, northwest, airlines, pan, am, united, airlines, and, us, airways, twice, where, an, airline, has, established, an, engineering, base, at, an, airport, then, there, may, be, considerable, economic, advantages, in, using, that, same, airport, as, a, preferred, focus, or, hub, for, its, scheduled, flights, fuel, hedging, is, a, contractual, tool, used, by, transportation, companies, like, airlines, to, reduce, their, exposure, to, volatile, and, potentially, rising, fuel, costs, several, low, cost, carriers, such, as, southwest, airlines, adopt, this, practice, southwest, is, credited, with, maintaining, strong, business, profits, between, 1999, and, the, early, 2000s, due, to, its, fuel, hedging, policy, many, other, airlines, are, replicating, southwest, s, hedging, policy, to, control, their, fuel, costs, operating, costs, for, us, major, airlines, are, primarily, aircraft, operating, expense, including, jet, fuel, aircraft, maintenance, depreciation, and, aircrew, for, 44, servicing, expense, for, 29, traffic, 11, passenger, 11, and, aircraft, 7, 14, for, reservations, and, sales, and, 13, for, overheads, administration,

1, 13, cts, asm, mckinsey, observes, that, newer, technology, larger, aircraft, and, increasingly, efficient, operations, continually, drive, down, the, cost, of, running, an, airline, from, nearly, 40, us, cents, per, ask, at, the, beginning, of, the, jet, age, to, just, above, 10, cents, since, 2000, those, improvements, were, passed, onto, the, customer, due, to, high, competition, fares, have, been, falling, throughout, the, history, of, airlines, airlines, assign, prices, to, their, services, in, an, attempt, to, maximize, profitability, the, pricing, of, airline, tickets, has, become, increasingly, complicated, over, the, years, and, is, now, largely, determined, by, computerized, yield, management, systems, because, of, the, complications, in, scheduling, flights, and, maintaining, profitability, airlines, have, many, loopholes, that, can, be, used, by, the, knowledgeable, traveler, many, of, these, airfare, secrets, are, becoming, more, and, more, known, to, the, general, public, so, airlines, are, forced, to, make, constant, adjustments, most, airlines, use, differentiated, pricing, a, form, of, price, discrimination, to, sell, air, services, at, varying, prices, simultaneously, to, different, segments, factors, influencing, the, price, include, the, days, remaining, until, departure, the, booked, load, factor, the, forecast, of, total, demand, by, price, point, competitive, pricing, in, force, and, variations, by, day, of, week, of, departure, and, by, time, of, day, carriers, often, accomplish, this, by, dividing, each, cabin, of, the, aircraft, first, business, and, economy, into, a, number, of, travel, classes, for, pricing, purposes, a, complicating, factor, is, that, of, origin, destination, control, o, d, control, someone, purchasing, a, ticket, from, melbourne, to, sydney, as, an, example, for, a, 200, is, competing, with, someone, else, who, wants, to, fly, melbourne, to, los, angeles, through, sydney, on, the, same, flight, and, who, is, willing, to, pay, a, 1400, should, the, airline, prefer, the, 1400, passenger, or, the, 200, passenger, plus, a, possible, sydney, los, angeles, passenger, willing, to, pay, 1300, airlines, have, to, make, hundreds, of, thousands, of, similar, pricing, decisions, daily, the, advent, of, advanced, computerized, reservations, systems, in, the, late, 1970s, most, notably, sabre, allowed, airlines, to, easily, perform, cost, benefit, analyses, on, different, pricing, structures, leading, to, almost, perfect, price, discrimination, in, some, cases, that, is, filling, each, seat, on, an, aircraft, at, the, highest, price, that, can, be, charged, without, driving, the, consumer, elsewhere, the, intense, nature, of, airfare, pricing, has, led, to, the, term, fare, war, to, describe, efforts, by, airlines, to, undercut, other, airlines, on, competitive, routes, through, computers, new, airfares, can, be, published, quickly, and, efficiently, to, the, airlines, sales, channels, for, this, purpose, the, airlines, use, the, airline, tariff, publishing, company, atpco, who, distribute, latest, fares, for, more, than, 500, airlines, to, computer, reservation, systems, across, the, world, the, extent, of, these, pricing, phenomena, is, strongest, in, legacy, carriers, in, contrast, low, fare, carriers, usually, offer, pre, announced, and, simplified, price, structure, and, sometimes, quote, prices, for, each, leg, of, a, trip, separately, computers, also, allow, airlines, to, predict, with, some, accuracy, how, many, passengers, will, actually, fly, after, making, a, reservation, to, fly, this, allows, airlines, to, overbook, their, flights, enough, to, fill, the, aircraft, while, accounting, for, no, shows, but, not, enough, in, most, cases, to, force, paying, passengers, off, the, aircraft, for, lack, of, seats, stimulative, pricing, for, low, demand, flights, coupled, with, overbooking, on, high, demand, flights, can, help, reduce, this, figure, this, is, especially, crucial, during, tough, economic, times, as, airlines, undertake, massive, cuts, to, ticket, prices, to, retain, demand, over, january, february, 2018, the, cheapest, airline, surveyed, by, price, comparator, rome2rio, was, now, defunct, tigerair, australia, with, 0, 06, km, followed, by, airasia, x, with, 0, 07, km, while, the, most, expensive, was, charterlines, inc, with, 1, 26, km, followed, by, buddha, air, with, 1, 18, km, for, the, iata, the, global, airline, industry, revenue, was, 754, billion, in, 2017, for, a, 38, 4, billion, collective, profit, and, should, rise, by, 10, 7, to, 834, billion, in, 2018, for, a, 33, 8, billion, profit, forecast, down, by, 12, due, to, rising, jet, fuel, and, labor, costs, the, demand, for, air, transport, will, be, less, elastic, for, longer, flights, than, for, shorter, flights, and, more, elastic, for, leisure, travel, than, for, business, travel, airlines, often, have, a, strong, seasonality, with, traffic, low, in, winter, and, peaking, in, summer, in, europe, the, most, extreme, market, are, the, greek, islands, with, july, august, having, more, than, ten, times, the, winter, traffic, as, jet2, is, the, most, seasonal, among, low, cost, carriers, with, july, having, seven, times, the, january, traffic, whereas, legacy, carriers, are, much, less, with, only, 85, 115, variability, airline, financing, is, quite, complex, since, airlines, are, highly, leveraged, operations, not, only, must, they, purchase, or, lease, new, airliner, bodies, and, engines, regularly, they, must, make, major, long, term, fleet, decisions, with, the, goal, of, meeting, the, demands, of, their, markets, while, producing, a, fleet, that, is, relatively, economical, to, operate, and, maintain, comparably, southwest, airlines, and, their, reliance, on, a, single, airplane, type, the, boeing, 737, and, derivatives, with, the, now, defunct, eastern, air, lines, which, operated, 17, different, aircraft, types, each, with, varying, pilot, engine, maintenance, and, support, needs, a, second, financial, issue, is, that, of, hedging, oil, and, fuel, purchases, which, are, usually, second, only, to, labor, in, its, relative, cost, to, the, company, however, with, the, current, high, fuel, prices, it, has, become, the, largest, cost, to, an, airline, legacy, airlines, compared, with, new, entrants, have, been, hit, harder, by, rising, fuel, prices, partly, due, to, the, running, of, older, less, fuel, efficient, aircraft, while, hedging, instruments, can, be, expensive, they, can, easily, pay, for, themselves, many, times, over, in, periods, of, increasing, fuel, costs, such, as, in, the, 2000, 2005, period, in, view, of, the, congestion, apparent, at, many, international, airports, the, ownership, of, slots, at, certain, airports, the, right, to, take, off, or, land, an, aircraft, at, a, particular, time, of, day, or, night, has, become, a, significant, tradable, asset, for, many, airlines, clearly, take, off, slots, at, popular, times, of, the, day, can, be, critical, in, attracting, the, more, profitable, business, traveler, to, a, given, airline, s, flight, and, in, establishing, a, competitive, advantage, against, a, competing, airline, if, a, particular, city, has, two, or, more, airports, market, forces, will, tend, to, attract, the, less, profitable, routes, or, those, on, which, competition, is, weakest, to, the, less, congested, airport, where, slots, are, likely, to, be, more, available, and, therefore, cheaper, for, example, reagan, national, airport, attracts, profitable, routes, due, partly, to, its, congestion, leaving, less, profitable, routes, to, baltimore, washington, international, airport, and, dulles, international, airport, other, factors, such, as, surface, transport, facilities, and, onward, connections, will, also, affect, the, relative, appeal, of, different, airports, and, some, long, distance, flights, may, need, to, operate, from, the, one, with, the, longest, runway, for, example, laguardia, airport, is, the, preferred, airport, for, most, of, manhattan, due, to, its, proximity, while, long, distance, routes, must, use, john, f, kennedy, international, airport, s, longer, runways, the, first, airline, alliance, was, formed, in, the, 1930s, when, pan, am, and, its, subsidiary, panair, do, brasil, agreed, to, codeshare, routes, in, latin, america, when, they, overlapped, with, each, other, codesharing, involves, one, airline, selling, tickets, for, another, airline, s, flights, under, its, own, airline, code, an, early, example, of, this, was, japan, airlines, jal, codesharing, partnership, with, aeroflot, in, the, 1960s, on, tokyo, moscow, flights, aeroflot, operated, the, flights, using, aeroflot, aircraft, but, jal, sold, tickets, for, the, flights, as, if, they, were, jal, flights, another, example, was, the, austrian, sabena, partnership, on, the, vienna, brussels, new, york, jfk, route, during, the, late, 60s, using, a, sabena, boeing, 707, with, austrian, livery, since, airline, reservation, requests, are, often, made, by, city, pair, such, as, show, me, flights, from, chicago, to, d, sseldorf, an, airline, that, can, codeshare, with, another, airline, for, a, variety, of, routes, might, be, able, to, be, listed, as, indeed, offering, a, chicago, d, sseldorf, flight, the, passenger, is, advised, however, that, airline, no, 1, operates, the, flight, from, say, chicago, to, amsterdam, for, example, and, airline, no, 2, operates, the, continuing, flight, on, a, different, airplane, sometimes, from, another, terminal, to, d, sseldorf, thus, the, primary, rationale, for, code, sharing, is, to, expand, one, s, service, offerings, in, city, pair, terms, to, increase, sales, a, more, recent, development, is, the, airline, alliance, which, became, prevalent, in, the, late, 1990s, these, alliances, can, act, as, virtual, mergers, to, get, around, government, restrictions, the, largest, are, star, alliance, skyteam, and, oneworld, and, these, accounted, for, over, 60, of, global, commercial, air, traffic, as, of, 2015, alliances, of, airlines, coordinate, their, passenger, service, programs, such, as, lounges, and, frequent, flyer, programs, offer, special, interline, tickets, and, often, engage, in, extensive, codesharing, sometimes, systemwide, these, are, increasingly, integrated, business, combinations, sometimes, including, cross, equity, arrangements, in, which, products, service, standards, schedules, and, airport, facilities, are, standardized, and, combined, for, higher, efficiency, one, of, the, first, airlines, to, start, an, alliance, with, another, airline, was, klm, who, partnered, with, northwest, airlines, both, airlines, later, entered, the, skyteam, alliance, after, the, fusion, of, klm, and, air, france, in, 2004, often, the, companies, combine, it, operations, or, purchase, fuel, and, aircraft, as, a, bloc, to, achieve, higher, bargaining, power, however, the, alliances, have, been, most, successful, at, purchasing, invisible, supplies, and, services, such, as, fuel, airlines, usually, prefer, to, purchase, items, visible, to, their, passengers, to, differentiate, themselves, from, local, competitors, if, an, airline, s, main, domestic, competitor, flies, boeing, airliners, then, the, airline, may, prefer, to, use, airbus, aircraft, regardless, of, what, the, rest, of, the, alliance, chooses, the, world, s, largest, airlines, can, be, defined, in, several, ways, as, of, 2019, american, airlines, group, was, the, largest, by, fleet, size, passengers, carried, and, revenue, passenger, mile, delta, air, lines, was, the, largest, by, revenue, assets, value, and, market, capitalization, lufthansa, group, was, the, largest, by, number, of, employees, fedex, express, by, freight, tonne, kilometres, turkish, airlines, by, number, of, countries, served, and, ups, airlines, by, number, of, destinations, served, though, united, airlines, was, the, largest, passenger, airline, by, number, of, destinations, served, historically, air, travel, has, survived, largely, through, state, support, whether, in, the, form, of, equity, or, subsidies, the, airline, industry, as, a, whole, has, made, a, cumulative, loss, during, its, 100, year, history, one, argument, is, that, positive, externalities, such, as, higher, growth, due, to, global, mobility, outweigh, the, microeconomic, losses, and, justify, continuing, government, intervention, a, historically, high, level, of, government, intervention, in, the, airline, industry, can, be, seen, as, part, of, a, wider, political, consensus, on, strategic, forms, of, transport, such, as, highways, and, railways, both, of, which, receive, public, funding, in, most, parts, of, the, world, although, many, countries, continue, to, operate, state, owned, or, parastatal, airlines, many, large, airlines, today, are, privately, owned, and, are, therefore, governed, by, microeconomic, principles, to, maximize, shareholder, profit, in, december, 1991, the, collapse, of, pan, am, an, airline, often, credited, for, shaping, the, international, airline, industry, highlighted, the, financial, complexities, faced, by, major, airline, companies, following, the, 1978, deregulation, u, s, carriers, did, not, manage, to, make, an, aggregate, profit, for, 12, years, in, 31, including, four, years, where, combined, losses, amounted, to, 10, billion, but, rebounded, with, eight, consecutive, years, of, profits, since, 2010, including, its, four, with, over, 10, billion, profits, they, drop, loss, making, routes, avoid, fare, wars, and, market, share, battles, limit, capacity, growth, add, hub, feed, with, regional, jets, to, increase, their, profitability, they, change, schedules, to, create, more, connections, buy, used, aircraft, reduce, international, frequencies, and, leverage, partnerships, to, optimize, capacities, and, benefit, from, overseas, connectivity, aircraft, engines, emit, noise, pollution, gases, and, particulate, emissions, and, contribute, to, global, dimming, growth, of, the, industry, in, recent, years, raised, a, number, of, ecological, questions, domestic, air, transport, grew, in, china, at, 15, 5, percent, annually, from, 2001, to, 2006, the, rate, of, air, travel, globally, increased, at, 3, 7, percent, per, year, over, the, same, time, in, the, eu, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, aviation, increased, by, 87, between, 1990, and, 2006, however, it, must, be, compared, with, the, flights, increase, only, in, uk, between, 1990, and, 2006, terminal, passengers, increased, from, 100, 000, thousands, to, 250, 000, thousands, according, to, aea, reports, every, year, 750, million, passengers, travel, by, european, airlines, which, also, share, 40, of, merchandise, value, in, and, out, of, europe, without, even, pressure, from, green, activists, targeting, lower, ticket, prices, generally, airlines, do, what, is, possible, to, cut, the, fuel, consumption, and, gas, emissions, connected, therewith, further, according, to, some, reports, it, can, be, concluded, that, the, last, piston, powered, aircraft, were, as, fuel, efficient, as, the, average, jet, in, 2005, despite, continuing, efficiency, improvements, from, the, major, aircraft, manufacturers, the, expanding, demand, for, global, air, travel, has, resulted, in, growing, greenhouse, gas, ghg, emissions, currently, the, aviation, sector, including, us, domestic, and, global, international, travel, make, approximately, 1, 6, percent, of, global, anthropogenic, ghg, emissions, per, annum, north, america, accounts, for, nearly, 40, percent, of, the, world, s, ghg, emissions, from, aviation, fuel, use, co, 2, emissions, from, the, jet, fuel, burned, per, passenger, on, an, average, 3, 200, kilometers, 2, 000, mi, airline, flight, is, about, 353, kilograms, 776, pounds, loss, of, natural, habitat, potential, associated, with, the, jet, fuel, burned, per, passenger, on, a, 3, 200, kilometers, 2, 000, mi, airline, flight, is, estimated, to, be, 250, square, meters, 2700, square, feet, in, the, context, of, climate, change, and, peak, oil, there, is, a, debate, about, possible, taxation, of, air, travel, and, the, inclusion, of, aviation, in, an, emissions, trading, scheme, with, a, view, to, ensuring, that, the, total, external, costs, of, aviation, are, taken, into, account, the, airline, industry, is, responsible, for, about, 11, percent, of, greenhouse, gases, emitted, by, the, u, s, transportation, sector, boeing, estimates, that, biofuels, could, reduce, flight, related, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, 60, to, 80, percent, the, solution, would, be, blending, algae, fuels, with, existing, jet, fuel, there, are, projects, on, electric, aircraft, and, some, of, which, are, fully, operational, as, of, 2013, each, operator, of, a, scheduled, or, charter, flight, uses, an, airline, call, sign, when, communicating, with, airports, or, air, traffic, control, most, of, these, call, signs, are, derived, from, the, airline, s, trade, name, but, for, reasons, of, history, marketing, or, the, need, to, reduce, ambiguity, in, spoken, english, so, that, pilots, do, not, mistakenly, make, navigational, decisions, based, on, instructions, issued, to, a, different, aircraft, some, airlines, and, air, forces, use, call, signs, less, obviously, connected, with, their, trading, name, for, example, british, airways, uses, a, speedbird, call, sign, named, after, the, logo, of, one, of, its, predecessors, boac, while, skyeurope, used, relax, the, various, types, of, airline, personnel, include, flight, crew, responsible,

service, agents, such, as, airline, lounge, employees, reservation, agents, usually, but, not, always, at, facilities, outside, the, airport, crew, schedulers, airlines, follow, a, corporate, structure, where, each, broad, area, of, operations, such, as, maintenance, flight, operations, including, flight, safety, and, passenger, service, is, supervised, by, a, vice, president, larger, airlines, often, appoint, vice, presidents, to, oversee, each, of, the, airline, s, hubs, as, well, airlines, employ, lawyers, to, deal, with, regulatory, procedures, and, other, administrative, tasks, the, pattern, of, ownership, has, been, privatized, since, the, mid, 1980s, that, is, the, ownership, has, gradually, changed, from, governments, to, private, and, individual, sectors, or, organizations, this, occurs, as, regulators, permit, greater, freedom, and, non, government, ownership, in, steps, that, are, usually, decades, apart, this, pattern, is, not, seen, for, all, airlines, in, all, regions, many, major, airlines, operating, between, the, 1940s, and, 1980s, were, government, owned, or, government, established, however, most, airlines, from, the, earliest, days, of, air, travel, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, were, personal, businesses, growth, rates, are, not, consistent, in, all, regions, but, countries, with, a, deregulated, airline, industry, have, more, competition, and, greater, pricing, freedom, this, results, in, lower, fares, and, sometimes, dramatic, spurts, in, traffic, growth, the, u, s, australia, canada, japan, brazil, india, and, other, markets, exhibit, this, trend, the, industry, has, been, observed, to, be, cyclical, in, its, financial, performance, four, or, five, years, of, poor, earnings, precede, five, or, six, years, of, improvement, but, profitability, even, in, the, good, years, is, generally, low, in, the, range, of, 2, 3, net, profit, after, interest, and, tax, in, times, of, profit, airlines, lease, new, generations, of, airplanes, and, upgrade, services, in, response, to, higher, demand, since, 1980, the, industry, has, not, earned, back, the, cost, of, capital, during, the, best, of, times, conversely, in, bad, times, losses, can, be, dramatically, worse, warren, buffett, in, 1999, said, the, money, that, had, been, made, since, the, dawn, of, aviation, by, all, of, this, country, s, airline, companies, was, zero, absolutely, zero, as, in, many, mature, industries, consolidation, is, a, trend, airline, groupings, may, consist, of, limited, bilateral, partnerships, long, term, multi, faceted, alliances, between, carriers, equity, arrangements, mergers, or, takeovers, since, governments, often, restrict, ownership, and, merger, between, companies, in, different, countries, most, consolidation, takes, place, within, a, country, in, the, u, s, over, 200, airlines, have, merged, been, taken, over, or, gone, out, of, business, since, the, airline, deregulation, act, in, 1978, many, international, airline, managers, are, lobbying, their, governments, to, permit, greater, consolidation, to, achieve, higher, economy, and, efficiency, there, are, several, types, of, passenger, airlines, mainly
