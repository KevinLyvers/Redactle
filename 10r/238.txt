a, composite, material, also, called, a, composition, material, or, shortened, to, composite, which, is, the, common, name, is, a, material, which, is, produced, from, two, or, more, constituent, materials, these, constituent, materials, have, notably, dissimilar, chemical, or, physical, properties, and, are, merged, to, create, a, material, with, properties, unlike, the, individual, elements, within, the, finished, structure, the, individual, elements, remain, separate, and, distinct, distinguishing, composites, from, mixtures, and, solid, solutions, composite, materials, with, more, than, one, distinct, layer, are, called, composite, laminates, typical, engineered, composite, materials, include, there, are, various, reasons, where, new, material, can, be, favoured, typical, examples, include, materials, which, are, less, expensive, lighter, stronger, or, more, durable, when, compared, with, common, materials, as, well, as, composite, materials, inspired, from, animals, and, natural, sources, with, low, carbon, footprint, more, recently, researchers, have, also, begun, to, actively, include, sensing, actuation, computation, and, communication, into, composites, which, are, known, as, robotic, materials, composite, materials, are, generally, used, for, buildings, bridges, and, structures, such, as, boat, hulls, swimming, pool, panels, racing, car, bodies, shower, stalls, bathtubs, storage, tanks, imitation, granite, and, cultured, marble, sinks, and, countertops, they, are, also, being, increasingly, used, in, general, automotive, applications, the, most, advanced, examples, perform, routinely, on, spacecraft, and, aircraft, in, demanding, environments, the, earliest, composite, materials, were, made, from, straw, and, mud, combined, to, form, bricks, for, building, construction, ancient, brick, making, was, documented, by, egyptian, tomb, paintings, wattle, and, daub, is, one, of, the, oldest, composite, materials, at, over, 6000, years, old, concrete, is, also, a, composite, material, and, is, used, more, than, any, other, synthetic, material, in, the, world, as, of, 2009, about, 7, 5, billion, cubic, metres, of, concrete, are, made, each, year, concrete, is, the, most, common, artificial, composite, material, of, all, and, typically, consists, of, loose, stones, aggregate, held, with, a, matrix, of, cement, concrete, is, an, inexpensive, material, and, will, not, compress, or, shatter, even, under, quite, a, large, compressive, force, however, concrete, cannot, survive, tensile, loading, i, e, if, stretched, it, will, quickly, break, apart, therefore, to, give, concrete, the, ability, to, resist, being, stretched, steel, bars, which, can, resist, high, stretching, tensile, forces, are, often, added, to, concrete, to, form, reinforced, concrete, fibre, reinforced, polymers, include, carbon, fiber, reinforced, polymers, and, glass, reinforced, plastic, if, classified, by, matrix, then, there, are, thermoplastic,

composites, formulated, using, fibre, or, fabric, reinforcements, and, shape, memory, polymer, resin, as, the, matrix, since, a, shape, memory, polymer, resin, is, used, as, the, matrix, these, composites, have, the, ability, to, be, easily, manipulated, into, various, configurations, when, they, are, heated, above, their, activation, temperatures, and, will, exhibit, high, strength, and, stiffness, at, lower, temperatures, they, can, also, be, reheated, and, reshaped, repeatedly, without, losing, their, material, properties, these, composites, are, ideal, for, applications, such, as, lightweight, rigid, deployable, structures, rapid, manufacturing, and, dynamic, reinforcement, high, strain, composites, are, another, type, of, high, performance, composites, that, are, designed, to, perform, in, a, high, deformation, setting, and, are, often, used, in, deployable, systems, where, structural, flexing, is, advantageous, although, high, strain, composites, exhibit, many, similarities, to, shape, memory, polymers, their, performance, is, generally, dependent, on, the, fibre, layout, as, opposed, to, the, resin, content, of, the, matrix, composites, can, also, use, metal, fibres, reinforcing, other, metals, as, in, metal, matrix, composites, mmc, or, ceramic, matrix, composites, cmc, which, includes, bone, hydroxyapatite, reinforced, with, collagen, fibres,

density, range, from, 2, g, cm, 3, to, 11, g, cm, 3, same, density, as, lead, the, most, common, name, for, this, type, of, material, is, high, gravity, compound, hgc, although, lead, replacement, is, also, used, these, materials, can, be, used, in, place, of, traditional, materials, such, as, aluminium, stainless, steel, brass, bronze, copper, lead, and, even, tungsten, in, weighting, balancing, for, example, modifying, the, centre, of, gravity, of, a, tennis, racquet, vibration, damping, and, radiation, shielding, applications, high, density, composites, are, an, economically, viable, option, when, certain, materials, are, deemed, hazardous, and, are, banned, such, as, lead, or, when, secondary, operations, costs, such, as, machining, finishing, or, coating, are, a, factor, there, have, been, several, studies, indicating, that, interleaving, stiff, and, brittle, epoxy, based, carbon, fiber, reinforced, polymer, laminates, with, flexible, thermoplastic, laminates, can, help, to, make, highly, toughened, composites, that, show, improved, impact, resistance, another, interesting, aspect, of, such, interleaved, composites, is, that, they, are, able, to, have, shape, memory, behaviour, without, needing, any, shape, memory, polymers, or, shape, memory, alloys, e, g, balsa, plies, interleaved, with, hot, glue, aluminium, plies, interleaved, with, acrylic, polymers, or, pvc,

from, individual, materials, these, individual, materials, are, known, as, constituent, materials, and, there, are, two, main, categories, of, it, one, is, the, matrix, binder, and, the, other, reinforcement, a, portion, of, each, kind, is, needed, at, least, the, reinforcement, receives, support, from, the, matrix, as, the, matrix, surrounds, the, reinforcement, and, maintains, its, relative, positions, the, properties, of, the, matrix, are, improved, as, the, reinforcements, impart, their, exceptional, physical, and, mechanical, properties, the, mechanical, properties, become, unavailable, from, the, individual, constituent, materials, by, synergism, at, the, same, time, the, designer, of, the, product, or, structure, receives, options, to, choose, an, optimum, combination, from, the, variety, of, matrix, and, strengthening, materials, to, shape, the, engineered, composites, it, must, be, formed, the, reinforcement, is, placed, onto, the, mould, surface, or, into, the, mould, cavity, before, or, after, this, the, matrix, can, be, introduced, to, the, reinforcement, the, matrix, undergoes, a, melding, event, which, sets, the, part, shape, necessarily, this, melding, event, can, happen, in, several, ways, depending, upon, the, matrix, nature, such, as, solidification, from, the, melted, state, for, a, thermoplastic, polymer, matrix, composite, or, chemical, polymerization, for, a, thermoset, polymer, matrix, according, to, the, requirements, of, end, item, design, various, methods, of, moulding, can, be, used, the, natures, of, the, chosen, matrix, and, reinforcement, are, the, key, factors, influencing, the, methodology, the, gross, quantity, of, material, to, be, made, is, another, main, factor, to, support, high, capital, investments, for, rapid, and, automated, manufacturing, technology, vast, quantities, can, be, used, cheaper, capital, investments, but, higher, labour, and, tooling, expenses, at, a, correspondingly, slower, rate, assists, the, small, production, quantities, many, commercially, produced, composites, use, a, polymer, matrix, material, often, called, a, resin, solution, there, are, many, different, polymers, available, depending, upon, the, starting, raw, ingredients, there, are, several, broad, categories, each, with, numerous, variations, the, most, common, are, known, as, polyester, vinyl, ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide, polyamide, polypropylene, peek, and, others, the, reinforcement, materials, are, often, fibres, but, also, commonly, ground, minerals, the, various, methods, described, below, have, been, developed, to, reduce, the, resin, content, of, the, final, product, or, the, fibre, content, is, increased, as, a, rule, of, thumb, lay, up, results, in, a, product, containing, 60, resin, and, 40, fibre, whereas, vacuum, infusion, gives, a, final, product, with, 40, resin, and, 60, fibre, content, the, strength, of, the, product, is, greatly, dependent, on, this, ratio, martin, hubbe, and, lucian, a, lucia, consider, wood, to, be, a, natural, composite, of, cellulose, fibres, in, a, matrix, of, lignin, several, layup, designs, of, composite, also, involve, a, co, curing, or, post, curing, of, the, prepreg, with, many, other, media, such, as, foam, or, honeycomb, generally, this, is, known, as, a, sandwich, structure, this, is, a, more, general, layup, for, the, production, of, cowlings, doors, radomes, or, non, structural, parts, open, and, closed, cell, structured, foams, like, polyvinyl, chloride, polyurethane, polyethylene, or, polystyrene, foams, balsa, wood, syntactic, foams, and, honeycombs, are, generally, utilized, core, materials, open, and, closed, cell, metal, foam, can, also, be, utilized, as, core, materials, recently, 3d, graphene, structures, also, called, graphene, foam, have, also, been, employed, as, core, structures, a, recent, review, by, khurram, and, xu, et, al, have, provided, the, summary, of, the, state, of, the, art, techniques, for, fabrication, of, the, 3d, structure, of, graphene, and, the, examples, of, the, use, of, these, foam, like, structures, as, a, core, for, their, respective, polymer, composites, although, the, two, phases, are, chemically, equivalent, semi, crystalline, polymers, can, be, described, both, quantitatively, and, qualitatively, as, composite, materials, the, crystalline, portion, has, a, higher, elastic, modulus, and, provides, reinforcement, for, the, less, stiff, amorphous, phase, polymeric, materials, can, range, from, 0, to, 100, crystallinity, aka, volume, fraction, depending, on, molecular, structure, and, thermal, history, different, processing, techniques, can, be, employed, to, vary, the, percent, crystallinity, in, these, materials, and, thus, the, mechanical, properties, of, these, materials, as, described, in, the, physical, properties, section, this, effect, is, seen, in, a, variety, of, places, from, industrial, plastics, like, polyethylene, shopping, bags, to, spiders, which, can, produce, silks, with, different, mechanical, properties, in, many, cases, these, materials, act, like, particle, composites, with, randomly, dispersed, crystals, known, as, spherulites, however, they, can, also, be, engineered, to, be, anisotropic, and, act, more, like, fiber, reinforced, composites, in, the, case, of, spider, silk, the, properties, of, the, material, can, even, be, dependent, on, the, size, of, the, crystals, independent, of, the, volume, fraction, ironically, single, component, polymeric, materials, are, some, of, the, most, easily, tunable, composite, materials, known, normally, the, fabrication, of, composite, includes, wetting, mixing, or, saturating, the, reinforcement, with, the, matrix, the, matrix, is, then, induced, to, bind, together, with, heat, or, a, chemical, reaction, into, a, rigid, structure, usually, the, operation, is, done, in, an, open, or, closed, forming, mould, however, the, order, and, ways, of, introducing, the, constituents, alters, considerably, composites, fabrication, is, achieved, by, a, wide, variety, of, methods, including, advanced, fibre, placement, automated, fibre, placement, fibreglass, spray, lay, up, process, filament, winding, lanxide, process, tailored, fibre, placement, tufting, and, z, pinning, the, reinforcing, and, matrix, materials, are, merged, compacted, and, cured, processed, within, a, mould, to, undergo, a, melding, event, the, part, shape, is, fundamentally, set, after, the, melding, event, however, under, particular, process, conditions, it, can, deform, the, melding, event, for, a, thermoset, polymer, matrix, material, is, a, curing, reaction, that, is, caused, by, the, possibility, of, extra, heat, or, chemical, reactivity, such, as, an, organic, peroxide, the, melding, event, for, a, thermoplastic, polymeric, matrix, material, is, a, solidification, from, the, melted, state, the, melding, event, for, a, metal, matrix, material, such, as, titanium, foil, is, a, fusing, at, high, pressure, and, a, temperature, near, the, melting, point, it, is, suitable, for, many, moulding, methods, to, refer, to, one, mould, piece, as, a, lower, mould, and, another, mould, piece, as, an, upper, mould, lower, and, upper, does, not, refer, to, the, mould, s, configuration, in, space, but, the, different, faces, of, the, moulded, panel, there, is, always, a, lower, mould, and, sometimes, an, upper, mould, in, this, convention, part, construction, commences, by, applying, materials, to, the, lower, mould, lower, mould, and, upper, mould, are, more, generalized, descriptors, than, more, common, and, specific, terms, such, as, male, side, female, side, a, side, b, side, tool, side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc, continuous, manufacturing, utilizes, a, different, nomenclature, usually, the, moulded, product, is, referred, to, as, a, panel, it, can, be, referred, to, as, casting, for, certain, geometries, and, material, combinations, it, can, be, referred, to, as, a, profile, for, certain, continuous, processes, some, of, the, processes, are, autoclave, moulding, vacuum, bag, moulding, pressure, bag, moulding, resin, transfer, moulding, and, light, resin, transfer, moulding, other, types, of, fabrication, include, casting, centrifugal, casting, braiding, onto, a, former, continuous, casting, filament, winding, press, moulding, transfer, moulding, pultrusion, moulding, and, slip, forming, there, are, also, forming, capabilities, including, cnc, filament, winding, vacuum, infusion, wet, lay, up, compression, moulding, and, thermoplastic, moulding, to, name, a, few, the, practice, of, curing, ovens, and, paint, booths, is, also, required, for, some, projects, the, composite, parts, finishing, is, also, crucial, in, the, final, design, many, of, these, finishes, will, involve, rain, erosion, coatings, or, polyurethane, coatings, the, mould, and, mould, inserts, are, referred, to, as, tooling, the, mould, tooling, can, be, built, from, different, materials, tooling, materials, include, aluminium, carbon, fibre, invar, nickel, reinforced, silicone, rubber, and, steel, the, tooling, material, selection, is, normally, based, on, but, not, limited, to, the, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, expected, number, of, cycles, end, item, tolerance, desired, or, expected, surface, condition, cure, method, glass, transition, temperature, of, the, material, being, moulded, moulding, method, matrix, cost, and, other, various, considerations, usually, the, composite, s, physical, properties, are, not, isotropic, independent, of, the, direction, of, applied, force, in, nature, but, they, are, typically, anisotropic, different, depending, on, the, direction, of, the, applied, force, or, load, for, instance, the, composite, panel, s, stiffness, will, usually, depend, upon, the, orientation, of, the, applied, forces, and, or, moments, the, composite, s, strength, is, bounded, by, two, loading, conditions, as, shown, in, the, plot, to, the, right, if, both, the, fibres, and, matrix, are, aligned, parallel, to, the, loading, direction, the, deformation, of, both, phases, will, be, the, same, assuming, there, is, no, delamination, at, the, fibre, matrix, interface, this, isostrain, condition, provides, the, upper, bound, for, composite, strength, and, is, determined, by, the, rule, of, mixtures, where, e, c, is, the, effective, composite, young, s, modulus, and, v, i, and, e, i, are, the, volume, fraction, and, young, s, moduli, respectively, of, the, composite, phases, for, example, a, composite, material, made, up, of, and, phases, as, shown, in, the, figure, to, the, right, under, isostrain, the, young, s, modulus, would, be, as, follows, e, c, v, e, v, e, displaystyle, e, c, v, alpha, e, alpha, v, beta, e, beta, where, v, and, v, are, the, respective, volume, fractions, of, each, phase, this, can, be, derived, by, considering, that, in, the, isostrain, case, c, displaystyle, epsilon, c, epsilon, alpha, epsilon, beta, epsilon, assuming, that, the, composite, has, a, uniform, cross, section, the, stress, on, the, composite, is, a, weighted, average, between, the, two, phases, c, v, v, displaystyle, sigma, c, sigma, alpha, v, alpha, sigma, beta, v, beta, the, stresses, in, the, individual, phases, are, given, by, hooke, s, law, e, displaystyle, sigma, beta, e, beta, epsilon, e, displaystyle, sigma, alpha, e, alpha, epsilon, combining, these, equations, gives, that, the, overall, stress, in, the, composite, is, c, e, v, e, v, e, v, e, v, displaystyle, sigma, c, e, alpha, v, alpha, epsilon, e, beta, v, beta, epsilon, e, alpha, v, alpha, e, beta, v, beta, epsilon, then, it, can, be, shown, that, e, c, e, v, e, v, displaystyle, e, c, e, alpha, v, alpha, e, beta, v, beta, the, lower, bound, is, dictated, by, the, isostress, condition, in, which, the, fibres, and, matrix, are, oriented, perpendicularly, to, the, loading, direction, c, displaystyle, sigma, c, sigma, alpha, sigma, beta, sigma, and, now, the, strains, become, a, weighted, average, c, v, v, displaystyle, epsilon, c, epsilon, alpha, v, alpha, epsilon, beta, v, beta, rewriting, hooke, s, law, for, the, individual, phases, e, displaystyle, epsilon, beta, frac, sigma, e, beta, e, displaystyle, epsilon, alpha, frac, sigma, e, alpha, this, leads, to, c, v, v, v, v, displaystyle, epsilon, c, v, beta, frac, sigma, epsilon, beta, v, alpha, frac, sigma, epsilon, alpha, frac, v, alpha, epsilon, alpha, frac, v, beta, epsilon, beta, sigma, from, the, definition, of, hooke, s, law, 1, e, c, v, e, v, e, displaystyle, frac, 1, e, c, frac, v, alpha, e, alpha, frac, v, beta, e, beta, and, in, general, following, the, example, above, if, one, had, a, composite, material, made, up, of, and, phases, under, isostress, conditions, as, shown, in, the, figure, to, the, right, the, composition, young, s, modulus, would, be, e, c, e, e, v, e, v, e, displaystyle, e, c, e, alpha, e, beta, v, alpha, e, beta, v, beta, e, alpha, the, isostrain, condition, implies, that, under, an, applied, load, both, phases, experience, the, same, strain, but, will, feel, different, stress, comparatively, under, isostress, conditions, both, phases, will, feel, the, same, stress, but, the, strains, will, differ, between, each, phase, a, generalized, equation, for, any, loading, condition, between, isostrain, and, isostress, can, be, written, as, where, x, is, a, material, property, such, as, modulus, or, stress, c, m, and, r, stand, for, the, properties, of, the, composite, matrix, and, reinforcement, materials, respectively, and, n, is, a, value, between, 1, and, 1, the, above, equation, can, be, further, generalized, beyond, a, two, phase, composite, to, an, m, component, system, though, composite, stiffness, is, maximized, when, fibres, are, aligned, with, the, loading, direction, so, is, the, possibility, of, fibre, tensile, fracture, assuming, the, tensile, strength, exceeds, that, of, the, matrix, when, a, fibre, has, some, angle, of, misorientation, several, fracture, modes, are, possible, for, small, values, of, the, stress, required, to, initiate, fracture, is, increased, by, a, factor, of, cos, 2, due, to, the, increased, cross, sectional, area, a, cos, of, the, fibre, and, reduced, force, f, cos, experienced, by, the, fibre, leading, to, a, composite, tensile, strength, of, parallel, cos, 2, where, parallel, is, the, tensile, strength, of, the, composite, with, fibres, aligned, parallel, with, the, applied, force, intermediate, angles, of, misorientation, lead, to, matrix, shear, failure, again, the, cross, sectional, area, is, modified, but, since, shear, stress, is, now, the, driving, force, for, failure, the, area, of, the, matrix, parallel, to, the, fibres, is, of, interest, increasing, by, a, factor, of, 1, sin, similarly, the, force, parallel, to, this, area, again, decreases, f, cos, leading, to, a, total, tensile, strength, of, my, sin, cos, where, my, is, the, matrix, shear, strength, finally, for, large, values, of, near, 2, transverse, matrix, failure, is, the, most, likely, to, occur, since, the, fibres, no, longer, carry, the, majority, of, the, load, still, the, tensile, strength, will, be, greater, than, for, the, purely, perpendicular, orientation, since, the, force, perpendicular, to, the, fibres, will, decrease, by, a, factor, of, 1, sin, and, the, area, decreases, by, a, factor, of, 1, sin, producing, a, composite, tensile, strength, of, perp, sin, 2, where, perp, is, the, tensile, strength, of, the, composite, with, fibres, align, perpendicular, to, the, applied, force, the, majority, of, commercial, composites, are, formed, with, random, dispersion, and, orientation, of, the, strengthening, fibres, in, which, case, the, composite, young, s, modulus, will, fall, between, the, isostrain, and, isostress, bounds, however, in, applications, where, the, strength, to, weight, ratio, is, engineered, to, be, as, high, as, possible, such, as, in, the, aerospace, industry, fibre, alignment, may, be, tightly, controlled, panel, stiffness, is, also, dependent, on, the, design, of, the, panel, for, instance, the, fibre, reinforcement, and, matrix, used, the, method, of, panel, build, thermoset, versus, thermoplastic, and, type, of, weave, in, contrast, to, composites, isotropic, materials, for, example, aluminium, or, steel, in, standard, wrought, forms, possess, the, same, stiffness, typically, despite, the, directional, orientation, of, the, applied, forces, and, or, moments, the, relationship, between, forces, moments, and, strains, curvatures, for, an, isotropic, material, can, be, described, with, the, following, material, properties, young, s, modulus, the, shear, modulus, and, the, poisson, s, ratio, in, relatively, simple, mathematical, relationships, for, the, anisotropic, material, it, needs, the, mathematics, of, a, second, order, tensor, and, up, to, 21, material, property, constants, for, the, special, case, of, orthogonal, isotropy, there, are, three, distinct, material, property, constants, for, each, of, young, s, modulus, shear, modulus, and, poisson, s, ratio, a, total, of, 9, constants, to, express, the, relationship, between, forces, moments, and, strains, curvatures, techniques, that, take, benefit, of, the, materials, anisotropic, properties, involve, mortise, and, tenon, joints, in, natural, composites, such, as, wood, and, pi, joints, in, synthetic, composites, in, general, particle, reinforcement, is, strengthening, the, composites, less, than, fiber, reinforcement, it, is, used, to, enhance, the, stiffness, of, the, composites, while, increasing, the, strength, and, the, toughness, because, of, their, mechanical, properties, they, are, used, in, applications, in, which, wear, resistance, is, required, for, example, hardness, of, cement, can, be, increased, by, reinforcing, gravel, particles, drastically, particle, reinforcement, a, highly, advantageous, method, of, tuning, mechanical, properties, of, materials, since, it, is, very, easy, implement, while, being, low, cost, the, elastic, modulus, of, particle, reinforced, composites, can, be, expressed, as, where, e, is, the, elastic, modulus, v, is, the, volume, fraction, the, subscripts, c, p, and, m, are, indicating, composite, particle, and, matrix, respectively, k, c, displaystyle, k, c, is, a, constant, can, be, found, empirically, similarly, tensile, strength, of, particle, reinforced, composites, can, be, expressed, as, where, t, s, is, the, tensile, strength, and, k, s, displaystyle, k, s, is, a, constant, not, equal, to, k, c, displaystyle, k, c, that, can, be, found, empirically, in, general, continuous, fiber, reinforcement, is, implemented, by, incorporating, a, fiber, as, the, strong, phase, into, a, weak, phase, matrix, the, reason, for, the, popularity, of, fiber, usage, is, materials, with, extraordinary, strength, can, be, obtained, in, their, fiber, form, non, metallic, fibers, are, usually, showing, a, very, high, strength, to, density, ratio, compared, to, metal, fibers, because, of, the, covalent, nature, of, their, bonds, the, most, famous, example, of, this, is, carbon, fibers, that, have, many, applications, extending, from, sports, gear, to, protective, equipment, to, space, industries, the, stress, on, the, composite, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, volume, fraction, of, the, fiber, and, the, matrix, where, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stress, v, is, the, volume, fraction, the, subscripts, c, f, and, m, are, indicating, composite, fiber, and, matrix, respectively, although, the, stress, strain, behavior, of, fiber, composites, can, only, be, determined, by, testing, there, is, an, expected, trend, three, stages, of, the, stress, strain, curve, the, first, stage, is, the, region, of, the, stress, strain, curve, where, both, fiber, and, the, matrix, are, elastically, deformed, this, linearly, elastic, region, can, be, expressed, in, the, following, form, where, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stress, displaystyle, epsilon, is, the, strain, e, is, the, elastic, modulus, and, v, is, the, volume, fraction, the, subscripts, c, f, and, m, are, indicating, composite, fiber, and, matrix, respectively, after, passing, the, elastic, region, for, both, fiber, and, the, matrix, the, second, region, of, the, stress, strain, curve, can, be, observed, in, the, second, region, the, fiber, is, still, elastically, deformed, while, the, matrix, is, plastically, deformed, since, the, matrix, is, the, weak, phase, the, instantaneous, modulus, can, be, determined, using, the, slope, of, the, stress, strain, curve, in, the, second, region, the, relationship, between, stress, and, strain, can, be, expressed, as, where, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stress, displaystyle, epsilon, is, the, strain, e, is, the, elastic, modulus, and, v, is, the, volume, fraction, the, subscripts, c, f, and, m, are, indicating, composite, fiber, and, matrix, respectively, to, find, the, modulus, in, the, second, region, derivative, of, this, equation, can, be, used, since, the, slope, of, the, curve, is, equal, to, the, modulus, in, most, cases, it, can, be, assumed, e, c, v, f, e, f, displaystyle, e, c, v, f, e, f, since, the, second, term, is, much, less, than, the, first, one, in, reality, the, derivative, of, stress, with, respect, to, strain, is, not, always, returning, the, modulus, because, of, the, binding, interaction, between, the, fiber, and, matrix, the, strength, of, the, interaction, between, these, two, phases, can, result, in, changes, in, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, composite, the, compatibility, of, the, fiber, and, matrix, is, a, measure, of, internal, stress, the, covalently, bonded, high, strength, fibers, e, g, carbon, fibers, experience, mostly, elastic, deformation, before, the, fracture, since, the, plastic, deformation, can, happen, due, to, dislocation, motion, whereas, metallic, fibers, have, more, space, to, plastically, deform, so, their, composites, exhibit, a, third, stage, where, both, fiber, and, the, matrix, are, plastically, deforming, metallic, fibers, have, many, applications, to, work, at, cryogenic, temperatures, that, is, one, of, the, advantages, of, composites, with, metal, fibers, over, nonmetallic, the, stress, in, this, region, of, the, stress, strain, curve, can, be, expressed, as, where, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stress, displaystyle, epsilon, is, the, strain, e, is, the, elastic, modulus, and, v, is, the, volume, fraction, the, subscripts, c, f, and, m, are, indicating, composite, fiber, and, matrix, respectively, f, c, displaystyle, sigma, f, epsilon, c, and, m, c, displaystyle, sigma, m, epsilon, c, are, for, fiber, and, matrix, flow, stresses, respectively, just, after, the, third, region, the, composite, exhibit, necking, the, necking, strain, of, composite, is, happened, to, be, between, the, necking, strain, of, the, fiber, and, the, matrix, just, like, other, mechanical, properties, of, the, composites, the, necking, strain, of, the, weak, phase, is, delayed, by, the, strong, phase, the, amount, of, the, delay, depends, upon, the, volume, fraction, of, the, strong, phase, thus, the, tensile, strength, of, the, composite, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, volume, fraction, where, t, s, is, the, tensile, strength, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stress, displaystyle, epsilon, is, the, strain, e, is, the, elastic, modulus, and, v, is, the, volume, fraction, the, subscripts, c, f, and, m, are, indicating, composite, fiber, and, matrix, respectively, the, composite, tensile, strength, can, be, expressed, as, the, critical, value, of, volume, fraction, can, be, expressed, as, evidently, the, composite, tensile, strength, can, be, higher, than, the, matrix, if, t, s, c, displaystyle, t, s, c, is, greater, than, t, s, m, displaystyle, t, s, m, thus, the, minimum, volume, fraction, of, the, fiber, can, be, expressed, as, although, this, minimum, value, is, very, low, in, practice, it, is, very, important, to, know, since, the, reason, for, the, incorporation, of, continuous, fibers, is, to, improve, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, materials, composites, and, this, value, of, volume, fraction, is, the, threshold, of, this, improvement, a, change, in, the, angle, between, the, applied, stress, and, fiber, orientation, will, affect, the, mechanical, properties, of, fiber, reinforced, composites, especially, the, tensile, strength, this, angle, displaystyle, theta, can, be, used, predict, the, dominant, tensile, fracture, mechanism, at, small, angles, 0, displaystyle, theta, approx, 0, circ, the, dominant, fracture, mechanism, is, the, same, as, with, load, fiber, alignment, tensile, fracture, the, resolved, force, acting, upon, the, length, of, the, fibers, is, reduced, by, a, factor, of, cos, displaystyle, cos, theta, from, rotation, f, res, f, cos, displaystyle, f, mbox, res, f, cos, theta, the, resolved, area, on, which, the, fiber, experiences, the, force, is, increased, by, a, factor, of, cos, displaystyle, cos, theta, from, rotation, a, res, a, 0, cos, displaystyle, a, mbox, res, a, 0, cos, theta, taking, the, effective, tensile, strength, to, be, t, s, c, f, res, a, res, displaystyle, mbox, t, s, mbox, c, f, mbox, res, a, mbox, res, and, the, aligned, tensile, strength, f, a, displaystyle, sigma, parallel, f, a, at, moderate, angles, 45, displaystyle, theta, approx, 45, circ, the, material, experiences, shear, failure, the, effective, force, direction, is, reduced, with, respect, to, the, aligned, direction, f, res, f, cos, displaystyle, f, mbox, res, f, cos, theta, the, resolved, area, on, which, the, force, acts, is, a, res, a, m, sin, displaystyle, a, mbox, res, a, m, sin, theta, the, resulting, tensile, strength, depends, on, the, shear, strength, of, the, matrix, m, displaystyle, tau, m, at, extreme, angles, 90, displaystyle, theta, approx, 90, circ, the, dominant, mode, of, failure, is, tensile, fracture, in, the, matrix, in, the, perpendicular, direction, as, in, the, isostress, case, of, layered, composite, materials, the, strength, in, this, direction, is, lower, than, in, the, aligned, direction, the, effective, areas, and, forces, act, perpendicular, to, the, aligned, direction, so, they, both, scale, by, sin, displaystyle, sin, theta, the, resolved, tensile, strength, is, proportional, to, the, transverse, strength, displaystyle, sigma, perp, the, critical, angles, from, which, the, dominant, fracture, mechanism, changes, can, be, calculated, as, where, c, 1, displaystyle, theta, c, 1, is, the, critical, angle, between, longitudinal, fracture, and, shear, failure, and, c, 2, displaystyle, theta, c, 2, is, the, critical, angle, between, shear, failure, and, transverse, fracture, by, ignoring, length, effects, this, model, is, most, accurate, for, continuous, fibers, and, does, not, effectively, capture, the, strength, orientation, relationship, for, short, fiber, reinforced, composites, furthermore, most, realistic, systems, do, not, experience, the, local, maxima, predicted, at, the, critical, angles, the, tsai, hill, criterion, provides, a, more, complete, description, of, fiber, composite, tensile, strength, as, a, function, of, orientation, angle, by, coupling, the, contributing, yield, stresses, displaystyle, sigma, parallel, displaystyle, sigma, perp, and, m, displaystyle, tau, m, anisotropy, in, the, tensile, strength, of, fiber, reinforced, composites, can, be, removed, by, randomly, orienting, the, fiber, directions, within, the, material, it, sacrifices, the, ultimate, strength, in, the, aligned, direction, for, an, overall, isotropically, strengthened, material, where, k, is, an, empirically, determined, reinforcement, factor, similar, to, the, particle, reinforcement, equation, for, fibers, with, randomly, distributed, orientations, in, a, plane, k, 0, 38, displaystyle, k, approx, 0, 38,
