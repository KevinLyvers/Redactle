coal, is, a, combustible, black, or, brownish, black, sedimentary, rock, formed, as, rock, strata, called, coal, seams, coal, is, mostly, carbon, with, variable, amounts, of, other, elements, chiefly, hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and, nitrogen, coal, is, a, type, of, fossil, fuel, formed, when, dead, plant, matter, decays, into, peat, which, is, converted, into, coal, by, the, heat, and, pressure, of, deep, burial, over, millions, of, years, vast, deposits, of, coal, originate, in, former, wetlands, called, coal, forests, that, covered, much, of, the, earth, s, tropical, land, areas, during, the, late, carboniferous, pennsylvanian, and, permian, times, coal, is, used, primarily, as, a, fuel, while, coal, has, been, known, and, used, for, thousands, of, years, its, usage, was, limited, until, the, industrial, revolution, with, the, invention, of, the, steam, engine, coal, consumption, increased, in, 2020, coal, supplied, about, a, quarter, of, the, world, s, primary, energy, and, over, a, third, of, its, electricity, some, iron, and, steel, making, and, other, industrial, processes, burn, coal, the, extraction, and, burning, of, coal, damages, the, environment, causing, premature, death, and, illness, and, it, is, the, largest, anthropogenic, source, of, carbon, dioxide, contributing, to, climate, change, fourteen, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, were, emitted, by, burning, coal, in, 2020, which, is, 40, of, total, fossil, fuel, emissions, and, over, 25, of, total, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, as, part, of, worldwide, energy, transition, many, countries, have, reduced, or, eliminated, their, use, of, coal, power, the, united, nations, secretary, general, asked, governments, to, stop, building, new, coal, plants, by, 2020, global, coal, use, was, 8, 3, billion, tonnes, in, 2022, and, is, set, to, remain, at, record, levels, in, 2023, to, meet, the, paris, agreement, target, of, keeping, global, warming, below, 2, c, 3, 6, f, coal, use, needs, to, halve, from, 2020, to, 2030, and, phasing, down, coal, was, agreed, upon, in, the, glasgow, climate, pact, the, largest, consumer, and, importer, of, coal, in, 2020, was, china, which, accounts, for, almost, half, the, world, s, annual, coal, production, followed, by, india, with, about, a, tenth, indonesia, and, australia, export, the, most, followed, by, russia, the, word, originally, took, the, form, col, in, old, english, from, reconstructed, proto, germanic, kula, n, from, proto, indo, european, root, g, e, u, lo, live, coal, germanic, cognates, include, the, old, frisian, kole, middle, dutch, cole, dutch, kool, old, high, german, chol, german, kohle, and, old, norse, kol, irish, gual, is, also, a, cognate, via, the, indo, european, root, the, conversion, of, dead, vegetation, into, coal, is, called, coalification, at, various, times, in, the, geologic, past, the, earth, had, dense, forests, in, low, lying, areas, in, these, wetlands, the, process, of, coalification, began, when, dead, plant, matter, was, protected, from, oxidation, usually, by, mud, or, acidic, water, and, was, converted, into, peat, the, resulting, peat, bogs, which, trapped, immense, amounts, of, carbon, were, eventually, deeply, buried, by, sediments, then, over, millions, of, years, the, heat, and, pressure, of, deep, burial, caused, the, loss, of, water, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, and, increased, the, proportion, of, carbon, the, grade, of, coal, produced, depended, on, the, maximum, pressure, and, temperature, reached, with, lignite, also, called, brown, coal, produced, under, relatively, mild, conditions, and, sub, bituminous, coal, bituminous, coal, or, anthracite, coal, also, called, hard, coal, or, black, coal, produced, in, turn, with, increasing, temperature, and, pressure, of, the, factors, involved, in, coalification, temperature, is, much, more, important, than, either, pressure, or, time, of, burial, subbituminous, coal, can, form, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 35, to, 80, c, 95, to, 176, f, while, anthracite, requires, a, temperature, of, at, least, 180, to, 245, c, 356, to, 473, f, although, coal, is, known, from, most, geologic, periods, 90, of, all, coal, beds, were, deposited, in, the, carboniferous, and, permian, periods, paradoxically, this, was, during, the, late, paleozoic, icehouse, a, time, of, global, glaciation, however, the, drop, in, global, sea, level, accompanying, the, glaciation, exposed, continental, shelves, that, had, previously, been, submerged, and, to, these, were, added, wide, river, deltas, produced, by, increased, erosion, due, to, the, drop, in, base, level, these, widespread, areas, of, wetlands, provided, ideal, conditions, for, coal, formation, the, rapid, formation, of, coal, ended, with, the, coal, gap, in, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, where, coal, is, rare, favorable, geography, alone, does, not, explain, the, extensive, carboniferous, coal, beds, other, factors, contributing, to, rapid, coal, deposition, were, high, oxygen, levels, above, 30, that, promoted, intense, wildfires, and, formation, of, charcoal, that, was, all, but, indigestible, by, decomposing, organisms, high, carbon, dioxide, levels, that, promoted, plant, growth, and, the, nature, of, carboniferous, forests, which, included, lycophyte, trees, whose, determinate, growth, meant, that, carbon, was, not, tied, up, in, heartwood, of, living, trees, for, long, periods, one, theory, suggested, that, about, 360, million, years, ago, some, plants, evolved, the, ability, to, produce, lignin, a, complex, polymer, that, made, their, cellulose, stems, much, harder, and, more, woody, the, ability, to, produce, lignin, led, to, the, evolution, of, the, first, trees, but, bacteria, and, fungi, did, not, immediately, evolve, the, ability, to, decompose, lignin, so, the, wood, did, not, fully, decay, but, became, buried, under, sediment, eventually, turning, into, coal, about, 300, million, years, ago, mushrooms, and, other, fungi, developed, this, ability, ending, the, main, coal, formation, period, of, earth, s, history, although, some, authors, pointed, at, some, evidence, of, lignin, degradation, during, the, carboniferous, and, suggested, that, climatic, and, tectonic, factors, were, a, more, plausible, explanation, reconstruction, of, ancestral, enzymes, by, phylogenetic, analysis, corroborated, a, hypothesis, that, lignin, degrading, enzymes, appeared, in, fungi, approximately, 200, mya, one, likely, tectonic, factor, was, the, central, pangean, mountains, an, enormous, range, running, along, the, equator, that, reached, its, greatest, elevation, near, this, time, climate, modeling, suggests, that, the, central, pangean, mountains, contributed, to, the, deposition, of, vast, quantities, of, coal, in, the, late, carboniferous, the, mountains, created, an, area, of, year, round, heavy, precipitation, with, no, dry, season, typical, of, a, monsoon, climate, this, is, necessary, for, the, preservation, of, peat, in, coal, swamps, coal, is, known, from, precambrian, strata, which, predate, land, plants, this, coal, is, presumed, to, have, originated, from, residues, of, algae, sometimes, coal, seams, also, known, as, coal, beds, are, interbedded, with, other, sediments, in, a, cyclothem, cyclothems, are, thought, to, have, their, origin, in, glacial, cycles, that, produced, fluctuations, in, sea, level, which, alternately, exposed, and, then, flooded, large, areas, of, continental, shelf, the, woody, tissue, of, plants, is, composed, mainly, of, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, lignin, modern, peat, is, mostly, lignin, with, a, content, of, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, ranging, from, 5, to, 40, various, other, organic, compounds, such, as, waxes, and, nitrogen, and, sulfur, containing, compounds, are, also, present, lignin, has, a, weight, composition, of, about, 54, carbon, 6, hydrogen, and, 30, oxygen, while, cellulose, has, a, weight, composition, of, about, 44, carbon, 6, hydrogen, and, 49, oxygen, bituminous, coal, has, a, composition, of, about, 84, 4, carbon, 5, 4, hydrogen, 6, 7, oxygen, 1, 7, nitrogen, and, 1, 8, sulfur, on, a, weight, basis, the, low, oxygen, content, of, coal, shows, that, coalification, removed, most, of, the, oxygen, and, much, of, the, hydrogen, a, process, called, carbonization, carbonization, proceeds, primarily, by, dehydration, decarboxylation, and, demethanation, dehydration, removes, water, molecules, from, the, maturing, coal, via, reactions, such, as, decarboxylation, removes, carbon, dioxide, from, the, maturing, coal, while, demethanation, proceeds, by, reaction, such, as, in, these, formulas, r, represents, the, remainder, of, a, cellulose, or, lignin, molecule, to, which, the, reacting, groups, are, attached, dehydration, and, decarboxylation, take, place, early, in, coalification, while, demethanation, begins, only, after, the, coal, has, already, reached, bituminous, rank, the, effect, of, decarboxylation, is, to, reduce, the, percentage, of, oxygen, while, demethanation, reduces, the, percentage, of, hydrogen, dehydration, does, both, and, together, with, demethanation, reduces, the, saturation, of, the, carbon, backbone, increasing, the, number, of, double, bonds, between, carbon, as, carbonization, proceeds, aliphatic, compounds, convert, to, aromatic, compounds, similarly, aromatic, rings, fuse, into, polyaromatic, compounds, linked, rings, of, carbon, atoms, the, structure, increasingly, resembles, graphene, the, structural, element, of, graphite, chemical, changes, are, accompanied, by, physical, changes, such, as, decrease, in, average, pore, size, the, macerals, are, coalified, plant, parts, that, retain, the, morphology, and, some, properties, of, the, original, plant, in, many, coals, individual, macerals, can, be, identified, visually, some, macerals, include, in, coalification, huminite, is, replaced, by, vitreous, shiny, vitrinite, maturation, of, bituminous, coal, is, characterized, by, bitumenization, in, which, part, of, the, coal, is, converted, to, bitumen, a, hydrocarbon, rich, gel, maturation, to, anthracite, is, characterized, by, debitumenization, from, demethanation, and, the, increasing, tendency, of, the, anthracite, to, break, with, a, conchoidal, fracture, similar, to, the, way, thick, glass, breaks, as, geological, processes, apply, pressure, to, dead, biotic, material, over, time, under, suitable, conditions, its, metamorphic, grade, or, rank, increases, successively, into, there, are, several, international, standards, for, coal, the, classification, of, coal, is, generally, based, on, the, content, of, volatiles, however, the, most, important, distinction, is, between, thermal, coal, also, known, as, steam, coal, which, is, burnt, to, generate, electricity, via, steam, and, metallurgical, coal, also, known, as, coking, coal, which, is, burnt, at, high, temperature, to, make, steel, hilt, s, law, is, a, geological, observation, that, within, a, small, area, the, deeper, the, coal, is, found, the, higher, its, rank, or, grade, it, applies, if, the, thermal, gradient, is, entirely, vertical, however, metamorphism, may, cause, lateral, changes, of, rank, irrespective, of, depth, for, example, some, of, the, coal, seams, of, the, madrid, new, mexico, coal, field, were, partially, converted, to, anthracite, by, contact, metamorphism, from, an, igneous, sill, while, the, remainder, of, the, seams, remained, as, bituminous, coal, the, earliest, recognized, use, is, from, the, shenyang, area, of, china, where, by, 4000, bc, neolithic, inhabitants, had, begun, carving, ornaments, from, black, lignite, coal, from, the, fushun, mine, in, northeastern, china, was, used, to, smelt, copper, as, early, as, 1000, bc, marco, polo, the, italian, who, traveled, to, china, in, the, 13th, century, described, coal, as, black, stones, which, burn, like, logs, and, said, coal, was, so, plentiful, people, could, take, three, hot, baths, a, week, in, europe, the, earliest, reference, to, the, use, of, coal, as, fuel, is, from, the, geological, treatise, on, stones, lap, 16, by, the, greek, scientist, theophrastus, c, 371, 287, bc, among, the, materials, that, are, dug, because, they, are, useful, those, known, as, anthrakes, are, made, of, earth, and, once, set, on, fire, they, burn, like, charcoal, they, are, found, in, liguria, and, in, elis, as, one, approaches, olympia, by, the, mountain, road, and, they, are, used, by, those, who, work, in, metals, outcrop, coal, was, used, in, britain, during, the, bronze, age, 3000, 2000, bc, where, it, formed, part, of, funeral, pyres, in, roman, britain, with, the, exception, of, two, modern, fields, the, romans, were, exploiting, coals, in, all, the, major, coalfields, in, england, and, wales, by, the, end, of, the, second, century, ad, evidence, of, trade, in, coal, dated, to, about, ad, 200, has, been, found, at, the, roman, settlement, at, heronbridge, near, chester, and, in, the, fenlands, of, east, anglia, where, coal, from, the, midlands, was, transported, via, the, car, dyke, for, use, in, drying, grain, coal, cinders, have, been, found, in, the, hearths, of, villas, and, roman, forts, particularly, in, northumberland, dated, to, around, ad, 400, in, the, west, of, england, contemporary, writers, described, the, wonder, of, a, permanent, brazier, of, coal, on, the, altar, of, minerva, at, aquae, sulis, modern, day, bath, although, in, fact, easily, accessible, surface, coal, from, what, became, the, somerset, coalfield, was, in, common, use, in, quite, lowly, dwellings, locally, evidence, of, coal, s, use, for, iron, working, in, the, city, during, the, roman, period, has, been, found, in, eschweiler, rhineland, deposits, of, bituminous, coal, were, used, by, the, romans, for, the, smelting, of, iron, ore, no, evidence, exists, of, coal, being, of, great, importance, in, britain, before, about, ad, 1000, the, high, middle, ages, coal, came, to, be, referred, to, as, seacoal, in, the, 13th, century, the, wharf, where, the, material, arrived, in, london, was, known, as, seacoal, lane, so, identified, in, a, charter, of, king, henry, iii, granted, in, 1253, initially, the, name, was, given, because, much, coal, was, found, on, the, shore, having, fallen, from, the, exposed, coal, seams, on, cliffs, above, or, washed, out, of, underwater, coal, outcrops, but, by, the, time, of, henry, viii, it, was, understood, to, derive, from, the, way, it, was, carried, to, london, by, sea, in, 1257, 1259, coal, from, newcastle, upon, tyne, was, shipped, to, london, for, the, smiths, and, lime, burners, building, westminster, abbey, seacoal, lane, and, newcastle, lane, where, coal, was, unloaded, at, wharves, along, the, river, fleet, still, exist, these, easily, accessible, sources, had, largely, become, exhausted, or, could, not, meet, the, growing, demand, by, the, 13th, century, when, underground, extraction, by, shaft, mining, or, adits, was, developed, the, alternative, name, was, pitcoal, because, it, came, from, mines, cooking, and, home, heating, with, coal, in, addition, to, firewood, or, instead, of, it, has, been, done, in, various, times, and, places, throughout, human, history, especially, in, times, and, places, where, ground, surface, coal, was, available, and, firewood, was, scarce, but, a, widespread, reliance, on, coal, for, home, hearths, probably, never, existed, until, such, a, switch, in, fuels, happened, in, london, in, the, late, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, centuries, historian, ruth, goodman, has, traced, the, socioeconomic, effects, of, that, switch, and, its, later, spread, throughout, britain, and, suggested, that, its, importance, in, shaping, the, industrial, adoption, of, coal, has, been, previously, underappreciated, xiv, xix, the, development, of, the, industrial, revolution, led, to, the, large, scale, use, of, coal, as, the, steam, engine, took, over, from, the, water, wheel, in, 1700, five, sixths, of, the, world, s, coal, was, mined, in, britain, britain, would, have, run, out, of, suitable, sites, for, watermills, by, the, 1830s, if, coal, had, not, been, available, as, a, source, of, energy, in, 1947, there, were, some, 750, 000, miners, in, britain, but, the, last, deep, coal, mine, in, the, uk, closed, in, 2015, a, grade, between, bituminous, coal, and, anthracite, was, once, known, as, steam, coal, as, it, was, widely, used, as, a, fuel, for, steam, locomotives, in, this, specialized, use, it, is, sometimes, known, as, sea, coal, in, the, united, states, small, steam, coal, also, called, dry, small, steam, nuts, dssn, was, used, as, a, fuel, for, domestic, water, heating, coal, played, an, important, role, in, industry, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, the, predecessor, of, the, european, union, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, was, based, on, the, trading, of, this, commodity, coal, continues, to, arrive, on, beaches, around, the, world, from, both, natural, erosion, of, exposed, coal, seams, and, windswept, spills, from, cargo, ships, many, homes, in, such, areas, gather, this, coal, as, a, significant, and, sometimes, primary, source, of, home, heating, fuel, coal, consists, mainly, of, a, black, mixture, of, diverse, organic, compounds, and, polymers, of, course, several, kinds, of, coals, exist, with, variable, dark, colors, and, variable, compositions, young, coals, brown, coal, lignite, are, not, black, the, two, main, black, coals, are, bituminous, which, is, more, abundant, and, anthracite, the, carbon, in, coal, follows, the, order, anthracite, bituminous, lignite, brown, coal, the, fuel, value, of, coal, varies, in, the, same, order, some, anthracite, deposits, contain, pure, carbon, in, the, form, of, graphite, for, bituminous, coal, the, elemental, composition, on, a, dry, ash, free, basis, of, 84, 4, carbon, 5, 4, hydrogen, 6, 7, oxygen, 1, 7, nitrogen, and, 1, 8, sulfur, on, a, weight, basis, this, composition, reflects, partly, the, composition, of, the, precursor, plants, the, second, main, fraction, of, coal, is, ash, an, undesirable, noncombustable, mixture, of, inorganic, minerals, the, composition, of, ash, is, often, discussed, in, terms, of, oxides, obtained, after, combustion, in, air, of, particular, interest, is, the, sulfur, content, of, coal, which, can, vary, from, less, than, 1, to, as, much, as, 4, most, of, the, sulfur, and, most, of, the, nitrogen, is, incorporated, into, the, organic, fraction, in, the, form, of, organosulfur, compounds, and, organonitrogen, compounds, this, sulfur, and, nitrogen, are, strongly, bound, within, the, hydrocarbon, matrix, these, elements, are, released, as, so, 2, and, no, x, upon, combustion, they, cannot, be, removed, economically, at, least, otherwise, some, coals, contain, inorganic, sulfur, mainly, in, the, form, of, iron, pyrite, fes, 2, being, a, dense, mineral, it, can, be, removed, from, coal, by, mechanical, means, e, g, by, froth, flotation, some, sulfate, occurs, in, coal, especially, weathered, samples, it, is, not, volatilized, and, can, be, removed, by, washing, minor, components, include, as, minerals, hg, as, and, se, are, not, problematic, to, the, environment, especially, since, they, are, only, trace, components, they, become, however, mobile, volatile, or, water, soluble, when, these, minerals, are, combusted, while, most, coal, is, used, as, fuel, other, large, scale, applications, exist, coke, is, a, solid, carbonaceous, residue, derived, from, coking, coal, a, low, ash, low, sulfur, bituminous, coal, also, known, as, metallurgical, coal, which, is, used, in, manufacturing, steel, and, other, iron, containing, products, coke, is, made, when, coking, coal, is, baked, in, an, oven, without, oxygen, at, temperatures, as, high, as, 1, 000, c, driving, off, the, volatile, constituents, and, fusing, together, the, fixed, carbon, and, residual, ash, metallurgical, coke, is, used, as, a, fuel, and, as, a, reducing, agent, in, smelting, iron, ore, in, a, blast, furnace, the, carbon, monoxide, produced, by, its, combustion, reduces, hematite, an, iron, oxide, to, iron, pig, iron, which, is, too, rich, in, dissolved, carbon, is, also, produced, the, coke, must, be, strong, enough, to, resist, the, weight, of, overburden, in, the, blast, furnace, which, is, why, coking, coal, is, so, important, in, making, steel, using, the, conventional, route, coke, from, coal, is, grey, hard, and, porous, and, has, a, heating, value, of, 29, 6, mj, kg, some, coke, making, processes, produce, byproducts, including, coal, tar, ammonia, light, oils, and, coal, gas, petroleum, coke, petcoke, is, the, solid, residue, obtained, in, oil, refining, which, resembles, coke, but, contains, too, many, impurities, to, be, useful, in, metallurgical, applications, chemicals, have, been, produced, from, coal, since, the, 1950s, coal, can, be, used, as, a, feedstock, in, the, production, of, a, wide, range, of, chemical, fertilizers, and, other, chemical, products, the, main, route, to, these, products, was, coal, gasification, to, produce, syngas, primary, chemicals, that, are, produced, directly, from, the, syngas, include, methanol, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, which, are, the, chemical, building, blocks, from, which, a, whole, spectrum, of, derivative, chemicals, are, manufactured, including, olefins, acetic, acid, formaldehyde, ammonia, urea, and, others, the, versatility, of, syngas, as, a, precursor, to, primary, chemicals, and, high, value, derivative, products, provides, the, option, of, using, coal, to, produce, a, wide, range, of, commodities, in, the, 21st, century, however, the, use, of, coal, bed, methane, is, becoming, more, important, because, the, slate, of, chemical, products, that, can, be, made, via, coal, gasification, can, in, general, also, use, feedstocks, derived, from, natural, gas, and, petroleum, the, chemical, industry, tends, to, use, whatever, feedstocks, are, most, cost, effective, therefore, interest, in, using, coal, tended, to, increase, for, higher, oil, and, natural, gas, prices, and, during, periods, of, high, global, economic, growth, that, might, have, strained, oil, and, gas, production, coal, to, chemical, processes, require, substantial, quantities, of, water, much, coal, to, chemical, production, is, in, china, where, coal, dependent, provinces, such, as, shanxi, are, struggling, to, control, its, pollution, coal, can, be, converted, directly, into, synthetic, fuels, equivalent, to, gasoline, or, diesel, by, hydrogenation, or, carbonization, coal, liquefaction, emits, more, carbon, dioxide, than, liquid, fuel, production, from, crude, oil, mixing, in, biomass, and, using, ccs, would, emit, slightly, less, than, the, oil, process, but, at, a, high, cost, state, owned, china, energy, investment, runs, a, coal, liquefaction, plant, and, plans, to, build, 2, more, coal, liquefaction, may, also, refer, to, the, cargo, hazard, when, shipping, coal, coal, gasification, as, part, of, an, integrated, gasification, combined, cycle, igcc, coal, fired, power, station, is, used, to, produce, syngas, a, mixture, of, carbon, monoxide, co, and, hydrogen, h, 2, gas, to, fire, gas, turbines, to, produce, electricity, syngas, can, also, be, converted, into, transportation, fuels, such, as, gasoline, and, diesel, through, the, fischer, tropsch, process, alternatively, syngas, can, be, converted, into, methanol, which, can, be, blended, into, fuel, directly, or, converted, to, gasoline, via, the, methanol, to, gasoline, process, gasification, combined, with, fischer, tropsch, technology, was, used, by, the, sasol, chemical, company, of, south, africa, to, make, chemicals, and, motor, vehicle, fuels, from, coal, during, gasification, the, coal, is, mixed, with, oxygen, and, steam, while, also, being, heated, and, pressurized, during, the, reaction, oxygen, and, water, molecules, oxidize, the, coal, into, carbon, monoxide, co, while, also, releasing, hydrogen, gas, h, 2, this, used, to, be, done, in, underground, coal, mines, and, also, to, make, town, gas, which, was, piped, to, customers, to, burn, for, illumination, heating, and, cooking, if, the, refiner, wants, to, produce, gasoline, the, syngas, is, routed, into, a, fischer, tropsch, reaction, this, is, known, as, indirect, coal, liquefaction, if, hydrogen, is, the, desired, end, product, however, the, syngas, is, fed, into, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, where, more, hydrogen, is, liberated, the, energy, density, of, coal, is, roughly, 24, megajoules, per, kilogram, approximately, 6, 7, kilowatt, hours, per, kg, for, a, coal, power, plant, with, a, 40, efficiency, it, takes, an, estimated, 325, kg, 717, lb, of, coal, to, power, a, 100, w, lightbulb, for, one, year, 27, 6, of, world, energy, was, supplied, by, coal, in, 2017, and, asia, used, almost, three, quarters, of, it, refined, coal, is, the, product, of, a, coal, upgrading, technology, that, removes, moisture, and, certain, pollutants, from, lower, rank, coals, such, as, sub, bituminous, and, lignite, brown, coals, it, is, one, form, of, several, precombustion, treatments, and, processes, for, coal, that, alter, coal, s, characteristics, before, it, is, burned, thermal, efficiency, improvements, are, achievable, by, improved, pre, drying, especially, relevant, with, high, moisture, fuel, such, as, lignite, or, biomass, the, goals, of, precombustion, coal, technologies, are, to, increase, efficiency, and, reduce, emissions, when, the, coal, is, burned, precombustion, technology, can, sometimes, be, used, as, a, supplement, to, postcombustion, technologies, to, control, emissions, from, coal, fueled, boilers, coal, burnt, as, a, solid, fuel, in, coal, power, stations, to, generate, electricity, is, called, thermal, coal, coal, is, also, used, to, produce, very, high, temperatures, through, combustion, early, deaths, due, to, air, pollution, have, been, estimated, at, 200, per, gw, year, however, they, may, be, higher, around, power, plants, where, scrubbers, are, not, used, or, lower, if, they, are, far, from, cities, efforts, around, the, world, to, reduce, the, use, of, coal, have, led, some, regions, to, switch, to, natural, gas, and, electricity, from, lower, carbon, sources, when, coal, is, used, for, electricity, generation, it, is, usually, pulverized, and, then, burned, in, a, furnace, with, a, boiler, see, also, pulverized, coal, fired, boiler, the, furnace, heat, converts, boiler, water, to, steam, which, is, then, used, to, spin, turbines, which, turn, generators, and, create, electricity, the, thermodynamic, efficiency, of, this, process, varies, between, about, 25, and, 50, depending, on, the, pre, combustion, treatment, turbine, technology, e, g, supercritical, steam, generator, and, the, age, of, the, plant, a, few, integrated, gasification, combined, cycle, igcc, power, plants, have, been, built, which, burn, coal, more, efficiently, instead, of, pulverizing, the, coal, and, burning, it, directly, as, fuel, in, the, steam, generating, boiler, the, coal, is, gasified, to, create, syngas, which, is, burned, in, a, gas, turbine, to, produce, electricity, just, like, natural, gas, is, burned, in, a, turbine, hot, exhaust, gases, from, the, turbine, are, used, to, raise, steam, in, a, heat, recovery, steam, generator, which, powers, a, supplemental, steam, turbine, the, overall, plant, efficiency, when, used, to, provide, combined, heat, and, power, can, reach, as, much, as, 94, igcc, power, plants, emit, less, local, pollution, than, conventional, pulverized, coal, fueled, plants, however, the, technology, for, carbon, capture, and, storage, ccs, after, gasification, and, before, burning, has, so, far, proved, to, be, too, expensive, to, use, with, coal, other, ways, to, use, coal, are, as, coal, water, slurry, fuel, cws, which, was, developed, in, the, soviet, union, or, in, an, mhd, topping, cycle, however, these, are, not, widely, used, due, to, lack, of, profit, in, 2017, 38, of, the, world, s, electricity, came, from, coal, the, same, percentage, as, 30, years, previously, in, 2018, global, installed, capacity, was, 2, tw, of, which, 1tw, is, in, china, which, was, 30, of, total, electricity, generation, capacity, the, most, dependent, major, country, is, south, africa, with, over, 80, of, its, electricity, generated, by, coal, but, china, alone, generates, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, coal, generated, electricity, maximum, use, of, coal, was, reached, in, 2013, in, 2018, coal, fired, power, station, capacity, factor, averaged, 51, that, is, they, operated, for, about, half, their, available, operating, hours, about, 8, 000, mt, of, coal, are, produced, annually, about, 90, of, which, is, hard, coal, and, 10, lignite, as, of, 2018, just, over, half, is, from, underground, mines, the, coal, mining, industry, employs, almost, 2, 7, million, workers, more, accidents, occur, during, underground, mining, than, surface, mining, not, all, countries, publish, mining, accident, statistics, so, worldwide, figures, are, uncertain, but, it, is, thought, that, most, deaths, occur, in, coal, mining, accidents, in, china, in, 2017, there, were, 375, coal, mining, related, deaths, in, china, most, coal, mined, is, thermal, coal, also, called, steam, coal, as, it, is, used, to, make, steam, to, generate, electricity, but, metallurgical, coal, also, called, metcoal, or, coking, coal, as, it, is, used, to, make, coke, to, make, iron, accounts, for, 10, to, 15, of, global, coal, use, china, mines, almost, half, the, world, s, coal, followed, by, india, with, about, a, tenth, australia, accounts, for, about, a, third, of, world, coal, exports, followed, by, indonesia, and, russia, while, the, largest, importers, are, japan, and, india, russia, is, increasingly, orienting, its, coal, exports, from, europe, to, asia, as, europe, transitions, to, renewable, energy, and, subjects, russia, to, sanctions, over, its, invasion, of, ukraine, the, price, of, metallurgical, coal, is, volatile, and, much, higher, than, the, price, of, thermal, coal, because, metallurgical, coal, must, be, lower, in, sulfur, and, requires, more, cleaning, coal, futures, contracts, provide, coal, producers, and, the, electric, power, industry, an, important, tool, for, hedging, and, risk, management, in, some, countries, new, onshore, wind, or, solar, generation, already, costs, less, than, coal, power, from, existing, plants, however, for, china, this, is, forecast, for, the, early, 2020s, and, for, southeast, asia, not, until, the, late, 2020s, in, india, building, new, plants, is, uneconomic, and, despite, being, subsidized, existing, plants, are, losing, market, share, to, renewables, of, the, countries, which, produce, coal, china, mines, by, far, the, most, almost, half, the, world, s, coal, followed, by, less, than, 10, by, india, china, is, also, by, far, the, largest, consumer, of, coal, therefore, international, market, trends, depend, on, chinese, energy, policy, although, the, government, effort, to, reduce, air, pollution, in, china, means, that, the, global, long, term, trend, is, to, burn, less, coal, the, short, and, medium, term, trends, may, differ, in, part, due, to, chinese, financing, of, new, coal, fired, power, plants, in, other, countries, countries, with, an, annual, production, higher, than, 300, million, tonnes, are, shown, countries, with, an, annual, consumption, higher, than, 500, million, tonnes, are, shown, shares, are, based, on, data, expressed, in, tonnes, oil, equivalent, exporters, are, at, risk, of, a, reduction, in, import, demand, from, india, and, china, the, use, of, coal, as, fuel, causes, health, problems, and, deaths, the, mining, and, processing, of, coal, causes, air, and, water, pollution, coal, powered, plants, emit, nitrogen, oxides, sulfur, dioxide, particulate, pollution, and, heavy, metals, which, adversely, affect, human, health, coal, bed, methane, extraction, is, important, to, avoid, mining, accidents, the, deadly, london, smog, was, caused, primarily, by, the, heavy, use, of, coal, globally, coal, is, estimated, to, cause, 800, 000, premature, deaths, every, year, mostly, in, india, and, china, burning, coal, is, a, major, contributor, to, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, which, creates, pm2, 5, particulates, the, most, dangerous, form, of, air, pollution, coal, smokestack, emissions, cause, asthma, strokes, reduced, intelligence, artery, blockages, heart, attacks, congestive, heart, failure, cardiac, arrhythmias, mercury, poisoning, arterial, occlusion, and, lung, cancer, annual, health, costs, in, europe, from, use, of, coal, to, generate, electricity, are, estimated, at, up, to, 43, billion, in, china, improvements, to, air, quality, and, human, health, would, increase, with, more, stringent, climate, policies, mainly, because, the, country, s, energy, is, so, heavily, reliant, on, coal, and, there, would, be, a, net, economic, benefit, a, 2017, study, in, the, economic, journal, found, that, for, britain, during, the, period, 1851, 1860, a, one, standard, deviation, increase, in, coal, use, raised, infant, mortality, by, 6, 8, and, that, industrial, coal, use, explains, roughly, one, third, of, the, urban, mortality, penalty, observed, during, this, period, breathing, in, coal, dust, causes, coalworker, s, pneumoconiosis, or, black, lung, so, called, because, the, coal, dust, literally, turns, the, lungs, black, in, the, us, alone, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 500, former, employees, of, the, coal, industry, die, every, year, from, the, effects, of, breathing, in, coal, mine, dust, huge, amounts, of, coal, ash, and, other, waste, is, produced, annually, use, of, coal, generates, hundreds, of, millions, of, tons, of, ash, and, other, waste, products, every, year, these, include, fly, ash, bottom, ash, and, flue, gas, desulfurization, sludge, that, contain, mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic, and, other, heavy, metals, along, with, non, metals, such, as, selenium, around, 10, of, coal, is, ash, coal, ash, is, hazardous, and, toxic, to, human, beings, and, some, other, living, things, coal, ash, contains, the, radioactive, elements, uranium, and, thorium, coal, ash, and, other, solid, combustion, byproducts, are, stored, locally, and, escape, in, various, ways, that, expose, those, living, near, coal, plants, to, radiation, and, environmental, toxics, coal, mining, coal, combustion, wastes, and, flue, gas, are, causing, major, environmental, damage, water, systems, are, affected, by, coal, mining, for, example, the, mining, of, coal, affects, groundwater, and, water, table, levels, and, acidity, spills, of, fly, ash, such, as, the, kingston, fossil, plant, coal, fly, ash, slurry, spill, can, also, contaminate, land, and, waterways, and, destroy, homes, power, stations, that, burn, coal, also, consume, large, quantities, of, water, this, can, affect, the, flows, of, rivers, and, has, consequential, impacts, on, other, land, uses, in, areas, of, water, scarcity, such, as, the, thar, desert, in, pakistan, coal, mining, and, coal, power, plants, contribute, to, the, depletion, of, water, resources, one, of, the, earliest, known, impacts, of, coal, on, the, water, cycle, was, acid, rain, in, 2014, approximately, 100, tg, s, of, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, was, released, over, half, of, which, was, from, burning, coal, after, release, the, sulfur, dioxide, is, oxidized, to, h, 2, so, 4, which, scatters, solar, radiation, hence, its, increase, in, the, atmosphere, exerts, a, cooling, effect, on, the, climate, this, beneficially, masks, some, of, the, warming, caused, by, increased, greenhouse, gases, however, the, sulfur, is, precipitated, out, of, the, atmosphere, as, acid, rain, in, a, matter, of, weeks, whereas, carbon, dioxide, remains, in, the, atmosphere, for, hundreds, of, years, release, of, so, 2, also, contributes, to, the, widespread, acidification, of, ecosystems, disused, coal, mines, can, also, cause, issues, subsidence, can, occur, above, tunnels, causing, damage, to, infrastructure, or, cropland, coal, mining, can, also, cause, long, lasting, fires, and, it, has, been, estimated, that, thousands, of, coal, seam, fires, are, burning, at, any, given, time, for, example, brennender, berg, has, been, burning, since, 1668, and, is, still, burning, in, the, 21st, century, the, production, of, coke, from, coal, produces, ammonia, coal, tar, and, gaseous, compounds, as, byproducts, which, if, discharged, to, land, air, or, waterways, can, pollute, the, environment, the, whyalla, steelworks, is, one, example, of, a, coke, producing, facility, where, liquid, ammonia, was, discharged, to, the, marine, environment, emission, intensity, is, the, greenhouse, gas, emitted, over, the, life, of, a, generator, per, unit, of, electricity, generated, the, emission, intensity, of, coal, power, stations, is, high, as, they, emit, around, 1000, g, of, co, 2, eq, for, each, kwh, generated, while, natural, gas, is, medium, emission, intensity, at, around, 500, g, co, 2, eq, per, kwh, the, emission, intensity, of, coal, varies, with, type, and, generator, technology, and, exceeds, 1200, g, per, kwh, in, some, countries, thousands, of, coal, fires, are, burning, around, the, world, those, burning, underground, can, be, difficult, to, locate, and, many, cannot, be, extinguished, fires, can, cause, the, ground, above, to, subside, their, combustion, gases, are, dangerous, to, life, and, breaking, out, to, the, surface, can, initiate, surface, wildfires, coal, seams, can, be, set, on, fire, by, spontaneous, combustion, or, contact, with, a, mine, fire, or, surface, fire, lightning, strikes, are, an, important, source, of, ignition, the, coal, continues, to, burn, slowly, back, into, the, seam, until, oxygen, air, can, no, longer, reach, the, flame, front, a, grass, fire, in, a, coal, area, can, set, dozens, of, coal, seams, on, fire, coal, fires, in, china, burn, an, estimated, 120, million, tons, of, coal, a, year, emitting, 360, million, metric, tons, of, co, 2, amounting, to, 2, 3, of, the, annual, worldwide, production, of, co, 2, from, fossil, fuels, in, centralia, pennsylvania, a, borough, located, in, the, coal, region, of, the, u, s, an, exposed, vein, of, anthracite, ignited, in, 1962, due, to, a, trash, fire, in, the, borough, landfill, located, in, an, abandoned, anthracite, strip, mine, pit, attempts, to, extinguish, the, fire, were, unsuccessful, and, it, continues, to, burn, underground, to, this, day, the, australian, burning, mountain, was, originally, believed, to, be, a, volcano, but, the, smoke, and, ash, come, from, a, coal, fire, that, has, been, burning, for, some, 6, 000, years, at, kuh, i, malik, in, yagnob, valley, tajikistan, coal, deposits, have, been, burning, for, thousands, of, years, creating, vast, underground, labyrinths, full, of, unique, minerals, some, of, them, very, beautiful, the, reddish, siltstone, rock, that, caps, many, ridges, and, buttes, in, the, powder, river, basin, in, wyoming, and, in, western, north, dakota, is, called, porcelanite, which, resembles, the, coal, burning, waste, clinker, or, volcanic, scoria, clinker, is, rock, that, has, been, fused, by, the, natural, burning, of, coal, in, the, powder, river, basin, approximately, 27, to, 54, billion, tons, of, coal, burned, within, the, past, three, million, years, wild, coal, fires, in, the, area, were, reported, by, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, as, well, as, explorers, and, settlers, in, the, area, the, largest, and, most, long, term, effect, of, coal, use, is, the, release, of, carbon, dioxide, a, greenhouse, gas, that, causes, climate, change, coal, fired, power, plants, were, the, single, largest, contributor, to, the, growth, in, global, co, 2, emissions, in, 2018, 40, of, the, total, fossil, fuel, emissions, and, more, than, a, quarter, of, total, emissions, coal, mining, can, emit, methane, another, greenhouse, gas, in, 2016, world, gross, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, coal, usage, were, 14, 5, gigatonnes, for, every, megawatt, hour, generated, coal, fired, electric, power, generation, emits, around, a, tonne, of, carbon, dioxide, which, is, double, the, approximately, 500, kg, of, carbon, dioxide, released, by, a, natural, gas, fired, electric, plant, in, 2013, the, head, of, the, un, climate, agency, advised, that, most, of, the, world, s, coal, reserves, should, be, left, in, the, ground, to, avoid, catastrophic, global, warming, to, keep, global, warming, below, 1, 5, c, or, 2, c, hundreds, or, possibly, thousands, of, coal, fired, power, plants, will, need, to, be, retired, early, coal, pollution, mitigation, sometimes, labeled, as, clean, coal, is, a, series, of, systems, and, technologies, that, seek, to, mitigate, health, and, environmental, impact, of, burning, coal, for, energy, burning, coal, releases, harmful, substances, that, contribute, to, air, pollution, acid, rain, and, greenhouse, gas, emissions, mitigation, includes, precombustion, approaches, such, as, cleaning, coal, and, post, combustion, approaches, include, flue, gas, desulfurization, selective, catalytic, reduction, electrostatic, precipitators, and, fly, ash, reduction, these, measures, aim, to, reduce, coal, s, impact, on, human, health, and, the, environment, in, 2018, us, 80, billion, was, invested, in, coal, supply, but, almost, all, for, sustaining, production, levels, rather, than, opening, new, mines, in, the, long, term, coal, and, oil, could, cost, the, world, trillions, of, dollars, per, year, coal, alone, may, cost, australia, billions, whereas, costs, to, some, smaller, companies, or, cities, could, be, on, the, scale, of, millions, of, dollars, the, economies, most, damaged, by, coal, via, climate, change, may, be, india, and, the, us, as, they, are, the, countries, with, the, highest, social, cost, of, carbon, bank, loans, to, finance, coal, are, a, risk, to, the, indian, economy, china, is, the, largest, producer, of, coal, in, the, world, it, is, the, world, s, largest, energy, consumer, and, coal, in, china, supplies, 60, of, its, primary, energy, however, two, fifths, of, china, s, coal, power, stations, are, estimated, to, be, loss, making, air, pollution, from, coal, storage, and,
