a, brick, is, a, type, of, construction, material, used, to, build, walls, pavements, and, other, elements, in, masonry, construction, properly, the, term, brick, denotes, a, unit, primarily, composed, of, clay, but, is, now, also, used, informally, to, denote, units, made, of, other, materials, or, other, chemically, cured, construction, blocks, bricks, can, be, joined, using, mortar, adhesives, or, by, interlocking, bricks, are, usually, produced, at, brickworks, in, numerous, classes, types, materials, and, sizes, which, vary, with, region, and, are, produced, in, bulk, quantities, block, is, a, similar, term, referring, to, a, rectangular, building, unit, composed, of, clay, or, concrete, but, is, usually, larger, than, a, brick, lightweight, bricks, also, called, lightweight, blocks, are, made, from, expanded, clay, aggregate, fired, bricks, are, one, of, the, longest, lasting, and, strongest, building, materials, sometimes, referred, to, as, artificial, stone, and, have, been, used, since, c, 4000, bc, air, dried, bricks, also, known, as, mudbricks, have, a, history, older, than, fired, bricks, and, have, an, additional, ingredient, of, a, mechanical, binder, such, as, straw, bricks, are, laid, in, courses, and, numerous, patterns, known, as, bonds, collectively, known, as, brickwork, and, may, be, laid, in, various, kinds, of, mortar, to, hold, the, bricks, together, to, make, a, durable, structure, the, earliest, bricks, were, dried, mudbricks, meaning, that, they, were, formed, from, clay, bearing, earth, or, mud, and, dried, usually, in, the, sun, until, they, were, strong, enough, for, use, the, oldest, discovered, bricks, originally, made, from, shaped, mud, and, dating, before, 7500, bc, were, found, at, tell, aswad, in, the, upper, tigris, region, and, in, southeast, anatolia, close, to, diyarbakir, mudbrick, construction, was, used, at, atalh, y, k, from, c, 7, 400, bc, mudbrick, structures, dating, to, c, 7, 200, bc, have, been, located, in, jericho, jordan, valley, these, structures, were, made, up, of, the, first, bricks, with, dimension, 400x150x100, mm, between, 5000, and, 4500, bc, mesopotamia, had, discovered, fired, brick, the, standard, brick, sizes, in, mesopotamia, followed, a, general, rule, the, width, of, the, dried, or, burned, brick, would, be, twice, its, thickness, and, its, length, would, be, double, its, width, the, south, asian, inhabitants, of, mehrgarh, also, constructed, air, dried, mudbrick, structures, between, 7000, and, 3300, bc, and, later, the, ancient, indus, valley, cities, of, mohenjo, daro, harappa, and, mehrgarh, ceramic, or, fired, brick, was, used, as, early, as, 3000, bc, in, early, indus, valley, cities, like, kalibangan, in, the, middle, of, the, third, millennium, bc, there, was, a, rise, in, monumental, baked, brick, architecture, in, indus, cities, examples, included, the, great, bath, at, mohenjo, daro, the, fire, altars, of, kaalibangan, and, the, granary, of, harappa, there, was, a, uniformity, to, the, brick, sizes, throughout, the, indus, valley, region, conforming, to, the, 1, 2, 4, thickness, width, and, length, ratio, as, the, indus, civilization, began, its, decline, at, the, start, of, the, second, millennium, bc, harappans, migrated, east, spreading, their, knowledge, of, brickmaking, technology, this, led, to, the, rise, of, cities, like, pataliputra, kausambi, and, ujjain, where, there, was, an, enormous, demand, for, kiln, made, bricks, by, 604, bc, bricks, were, the, construction, materials, for, architectural, wonders, such, as, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, where, glazed, fired, bricks, were, put, into, practice, the, earliest, fired, bricks, appeared, in, neolithic, china, around, 4400, bc, at, chengtoushan, a, walled, settlement, of, the, daxi, culture, these, bricks, were, made, of, red, clay, fired, on, all, sides, to, above, 600, c, and, used, as, flooring, for, houses, by, the, qujialing, period, 3300, bc, fired, bricks, were, being, used, to, pave, roads, and, as, building, foundations, at, chengtoushan, according, to, lukas, nickel, the, use, of, ceramic, pieces, for, protecting, and, decorating, floors, and, walls, dates, back, at, various, cultural, sites, to, 3000, 2000, bc, and, perhaps, even, before, but, these, elements, should, be, rather, qualified, as, tiles, for, the, longest, time, builders, relied, on, wood, mud, and, rammed, earth, while, fired, brick, and, mudbrick, played, no, structural, role, in, architecture, proper, brick, construction, for, erecting, walls, and, vaults, finally, emerges, in, the, third, century, bc, when, baked, bricks, of, regular, shape, began, to, be, employed, for, vaulting, underground, tombs, hollow, brick, tomb, chambers, rose, in, popularity, as, builders, were, forced, to, adapt, due, to, a, lack, of, readily, available, wood, or, stone, the, oldest, extant, brick, building, above, ground, is, possibly, songyue, pagoda, dated, to, 523, ad, by, the, end, of, the, third, century, bc, in, china, both, hollow, and, small, bricks, were, available, for, use, in, building, walls, and, ceilings, fired, bricks, were, first, mass, produced, during, the, construction, of, the, tomb, of, china, s, first, emperor, qin, shi, huangdi, the, floors, of, the, three, pits, of, the, terracotta, army, were, paved, with, an, estimated, 230, 000, bricks, with, the, majority, measuring, 28x14x7, cm, following, a, 4, 2, 1, ratio, the, use, of, fired, bricks, in, chinese, city, walls, first, appeared, in, the, eastern, han, dynasty, 25, ad, 220, ad, up, until, the, middle, ages, buildings, in, central, asia, were, typically, built, with, unbaked, bricks, it, was, only, starting, in, the, ninth, century, ce, when, buildings, were, entirely, constructed, using, fired, bricks, the, carpenter, s, manual, yingzao, fashi, published, in, 1103, at, the, time, of, the, song, dynasty, described, the, brick, making, process, and, glazing, techniques, then, in, use, using, the, 17th, century, encyclopaedic, text, tiangong, kaiwu, historian, timothy, brook, outlined, the, brick, production, process, of, ming, dynasty, china, the, kilnmaster, had, to, make, sure, that, the, temperature, inside, the, kiln, stayed, at, a, level, that, caused, the, clay, to, shimmer, with, the, colour, of, molten, gold, or, silver, he, also, had, to, know, when, to, quench, the, kiln, with, water, so, as, to, produce, the, surface, glaze, to, anonymous, labourers, fell, the, less, skilled, stages, of, brick, production, mixing, clay, and, water, driving, oxen, over, the, mixture, to, trample, it, into, a, thick, paste, scooping, the, paste, into, standardised, wooden, frames, to, produce, a, brick, roughly, 42, cm, long, 20, cm, wide, and, 10, cm, thick, smoothing, the, surfaces, with, a, wire, strung, bow, removing, them, from, the, frames, printing, the, fronts, and, backs, with, stamps, that, indicated, where, the, bricks, came, from, and, who, made, them, loading, the, kilns, with, fuel, likelier, wood, than, coal, stacking, the, bricks, in, the, kiln, removing, them, to, cool, while, the, kilns, were, still, hot, and, bundling, them, into, pallets, for, transportation, it, was, hot, filthy, work, early, civilisations, around, the, mediterranean, including, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, adopted, the, use, of, fired, bricks, by, the, early, first, century, ce, standardised, fired, bricks, were, being, heavily, produced, in, rome, the, roman, legions, operated, mobile, kilns, and, built, large, brick, structures, throughout, the, roman, empire, stamping, the, bricks, with, the, seal, of, the, legion, the, romans, used, brick, for, walls, arches, forts, aqueducts, etc, notable, mentions, of, roman, brick, structures, are, the, herculaneum, gate, of, pompeii, and, the, baths, of, caracalla, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, use, of, bricks, in, construction, became, popular, in, northern, europe, after, being, introduced, there, from, northwestern, italy, an, independent, style, of, brick, architecture, known, as, brick, gothic, similar, to, gothic, architecture, flourished, in, places, that, lacked, indigenous, sources, of, rocks, examples, of, this, architectural, style, can, be, found, in, modern, day, denmark, germany, poland, and, kaliningrad, former, east, prussia, this, style, evolved, into, the, brick, renaissance, as, the, stylistic, changes, associated, with, the, italian, renaissance, spread, to, northern, europe, leading, to, the, adoption, of, renaissance, elements, into, brick, building, identifiable, attributes, included, a, low, pitched, hipped, or, flat, roof, symmetrical, facade, round, arch, entrances, and, windows, columns, and, pilasters, and, more, a, clear, distinction, between, the, two, styles, only, developed, at, the, transition, to, baroque, architecture, in, l, beck, for, example, brick, renaissance, is, clearly, recognisable, in, buildings, equipped, with, terracotta, reliefs, by, the, artist, statius, von, d, ren, who, was, also, active, at, schwerin, schwerin, castle, and, wismar, f, rstenhof, long, distance, bulk, transport, of, bricks, and, other, construction, equipment, remained, prohibitively, expensive, until, the, development, of, modern, transportation, infrastructure, with, the, construction, of, canal, roads, and, railways, production, of, bricks, increased, massively, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, rise, in, factory, building, in, england, for, reasons, of, speed, and, economy, bricks, were, increasingly, preferred, as, building, material, to, stone, even, in, areas, where, the, stone, was, readily, available, it, was, at, this, time, in, london, that, bright, red, brick, was, chosen, for, construction, to, make, the, buildings, more, visible, in, the, heavy, fog, and, to, help, prevent, traffic, accidents, the, transition, from, the, traditional, method, of, production, known, as, hand, moulding, to, a, mechanised, form, of, mass, production, slowly, took, place, during, the, first, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, brick, making, machine, was, patented, by, richard, a, ver, valen, of, haverstraw, new, york, in, 1852, the, bradley, craven, ltd, stiff, plastic, brickmaking, machine, was, patented, in, 1853, bradley, craven, went, on, to, be, a, dominant, manufacturer, of, brickmaking, machinery, henry, clayton, employed, at, the, atlas, works, in, middlesex, england, in, 1855, patented, a, brick, making, machine, that, was, capable, of, producing, up, to, 25, 000, bricks, daily, with, minimal, supervision, his, mechanical, apparatus, soon, achieved, widespread, attention, after, it, was, adopted, for, use, by, the, south, eastern, railway, company, for, brick, making, at, their, factory, near, folkestone, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, hudson, river, region, of, new, york, state, would, become, the, world, s, largest, brick, manufacturing, region, with, 130, brickyards, lining, the, shores, of, the, hudson, river, from, mechanicsville, to, haverstraw, and, employing, 8, 000, people, at, its, peak, about, 1, billion, bricks, were, produced, a, year, with, many, being, sent, to, new, york, city, for, use, in, its, construction, industry, the, demand, for, high, office, building, construction, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, led, to, a, much, greater, use, of, cast, and, wrought, iron, and, later, steel, and, concrete, the, use, of, brick, for, skyscraper, construction, severely, limited, the, size, of, the, building, the, monadnock, building, built, in, 1896, in, chicago, required, exceptionally, thick, walls, to, maintain, the, structural, integrity, of, its, 17, storeys, following, pioneering, work, in, the, 1950s, at, the, swiss, federal, institute, of, technology, and, the, building, research, establishment, in, watford, uk, the, use, of, improved, masonry, for, the, construction, of, tall, structures, up, to, 18, storeys, high, was, made, viable, however, the, use, of, brick, has, largely, remained, restricted, to, small, to, medium, sized, buildings, as, steel, and, concrete, remain, superior, materials, for, high, rise, construction, four, basic, types, of, brick, are, un, fired, fired, chemically, set, bricks, and, compressed, earth, blocks, each, type, is, manufactured, differently, for, various, purposes, unfired, bricks, also, known, as, mudbrick, are, made, from, a, mixture, of, silt, clay, sand, and, other, earth, materials, like, gravel, and, stone, combined, with, tempers, and, binding, agents, such, as, chopped, straw, grasses, tree, bark, or, dung, since, these, bricks, are, made, up, of, natural, materials, and, only, require, heat, from, the, sun, to, bake, mudbricks, have, a, relatively, low, embodied, energy, and, carbon, footprint, the, ingredients, are, first, harvested, and, added, together, with, clay, content, ranging, from, 30, to, 70, the, mixture, is, broken, up, with, hoes, or, adzes, and, stirred, with, water, to, form, a, homogenous, blend, next, the, tempers, and, binding, agents, are, added, in, a, ratio, roughly, one, part, straw, to, five, parts, earth, to, reduce, weight, and, reinforce, the, brick, by, helping, reduce, shrinkage, however, additional, clay, could, be, added, to, reduce, the, need, for, straw, which, would, prevent, the, likelihood, of, insects, deteriorating, the, organic, material, of, the, bricks, subsequently, weakening, the, structure, these, ingredients, are, thoroughly, mixed, together, by, hand, or, by, treading, and, are, then, left, to, ferment, for, about, a, day, the, mix, is, then, kneaded, with, water, and, molded, into, rectangular, prisms, of, a, desired, size, bricks, are, lined, up, and, left, to, dry, in, the, sun, for, three, days, on, both, sides, after, the, six, days, the, bricks, continue, drying, until, required, for, use, typically, longer, drying, times, are, preferred, but, the, average, is, eight, to, nine, days, spanning, from, initial, stages, to, its, application, in, structures, unfired, bricks, could, be, made, in, the, spring, months, and, left, to, dry, over, the, summer, for, use, in, the, autumn, mudbricks, are, commonly, employed, in, arid, environments, to, allow, for, adequate, air, drying, fired, bricks, are, baked, in, a, kiln, which, makes, them, durable, modern, fired, clay, bricks, are, formed, in, one, of, three, processes, soft, mud, dry, press, or, extruded, depending, on, the, country, either, the, extruded, or, soft, mud, method, is, the, most, common, since, they, are, the, most, economical, clay, and, shale, are, the, raw, ingredients, in, the, recipe, for, a, fired, brick, they, are, the, product, of, thousands, of, years, of, decomposition, and, erosion, of, rocks, such, as, pegmatite, and, granite, leading, to, a, material, that, has, properties, of, being, highly, chemically, stable, and, inert, within, the, clays, and, shales, are, the, materials, of, aluminosilicate, pure, clay, free, silica, quartz, and, decomposed, rock, one, proposed, optimal, mix, is, three, main, methods, are, used, for, shaping, the, raw, materials, into, bricks, to, be, fired, in, many, modern, brickworks, bricks, are, usually, fired, in, a, continuously, fired, tunnel, kiln, in, which, the, bricks, are, fired, as, they, move, slowly, through, the, kiln, on, conveyors, rails, or, kiln, cars, which, achieves, a, more, consistent, brick, product, the, bricks, often, have, lime, ash, and, organic, matter, added, which, accelerates, the, burning, process, the, other, major, kiln, type, is, the, bull, s, trench, kiln, btk, based, on, a, design, developed, by, british, engineer, w, bull, in, the, late, 19th, century, an, oval, or, circular, trench, is, dug, 6, 9, metres, 20, 30, ft, wide, 2, 2, 5, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, 8, ft, 2, in, deep, and, 100, 150, metres, 330, 490, ft, in, circumference, a, tall, exhaust, chimney, is, constructed, in, the, centre, half, or, more, of, the, trench, is, filled, with, green, unfired, bricks, which, are, stacked, in, an, open, lattice, pattern, to, allow, airflow, the, lattice, is, capped, with, a, roofing, layer, of, finished, brick, in, operation, new, green, bricks, along, with, roofing, bricks, are, stacked, at, one, end, of, the, brick, pile, historically, a, stack, of, unfired, bricks, covered, for, protection, from, the, weather, was, called, a, hack, cooled, finished, bricks, are, removed, from, the, other, end, for, transport, to, their, destinations, in, the, middle, the, brick, workers, create, a, firing, zone, by, dropping, fuel, coal, wood, oil, debris, etc, through, access, holes, in, the, roof, above, the, trench, the, constant, source, of, fuel, maybe, grown, on, the, woodlots, 6, the, advantage, of, the, btk, design, is, a, much, greater, energy, efficiency, compared, with, clamp, or, scove, kilns, sheet, metal, or, boards, are, used, to, route, the, airflow, through, the, brick, lattice, so, that, fresh, air, flows, first, through, the, recently, burned, bricks, heating, the, air, then, through, the, active, burning, zone, the, air, continues, through, the, green, brick, zone, pre, heating, and, drying, the, bricks, and, finally, out, the, chimney, where, the, rising, gases, create, suction, that, pulls, air, through, the, system, the, reuse, of, heated, air, yields, savings, in, fuel, cost, as, with, the, rail, process, the, btk, process, is, continuous, a, half, dozen, labourers, working, around, the, clock, can, fire, approximately, 15, 000, 25, 000, bricks, a, day, unlike, the, rail, process, in, the, btk, process, the, bricks, do, not, move, instead, the, locations, at, which, the, bricks, are, loaded, fired, and, unloaded, gradually, rotate, through, the, trench, the, colour, of, fired, clay, bricks, is, influenced, by, the, chemical, and, mineral, content, of, the, raw, materials, the, firing, temperature, and, the, atmosphere, in, the, kiln, for, example, pink, bricks, are, the, result, of, a, high, iron, content, white, or, yellow, bricks, have, a, higher, lime, content, most, bricks, burn, to, various, red, hues, as, the, temperature, is, increased, the, colour, moves, through, dark, red, purple, and, then, to, brown, or, grey, at, around, 1, 300, c, 2, 370, f, the, names, of, bricks, may, reflect, their, origin, and, colour, such, as, london, stock, brick, and, cambridgeshire, white, brick, tinting, may, be, performed, to, change, the, colour, of, bricks, to, blend, in, areas, of, brickwork, with, the, surrounding, masonry, an, impervious, and, ornamental, surface, may, be, laid, on, brick, either, by, salt, glazing, in, which, salt, is, added, during, the, burning, process, or, by, the, use, of, a, slip, which, is, a, glaze, material, into, which, the, bricks, are, dipped, subsequent, reheating, in, the, kiln, fuses, the, slip, into, a, glazed, surface, integral, with, the, brick, base, chemically, set, bricks, are, not, fired, but, may, have, the, curing, process, accelerated, by, the, application, of, heat, and, pressure, in, an, autoclave, calcium, silicate, bricks, are, also, called, sandlime, or, flintlime, bricks, depending, on, their, ingredients, rather, than, being, made, with, clay, they, are, made, with, lime, binding, the, silicate, material, the, raw, materials, for, calcium, silicate, bricks, include, lime, mixed, in, a, proportion, of, about, 1, to, 10, with, sand, quartz, crushed, flint, or, crushed, siliceous, rock, together, with, mineral, colourants, the, materials, are, mixed, and, left, until, the, lime, is, completely, hydrated, the, mixture, is, then, pressed, into, moulds, and, cured, in, an, autoclave, for, three, to, fourteen, hours, to, speed, the, chemical, hardening, the, finished, bricks, are, very, accurate, and, uniform, although, the, sharp, arrises, need, careful, handling, to, avoid, damage, to, brick, and, bricklayer, the, bricks, can, be, made, in, a, variety, of, colours, white, black, buff, and, grey, blues, are, common, and, pastel, shades, can, be, achieved, this, type, of, brick, is, common, in, sweden, as, well, as, russia, and, other, post, soviet, countries, especially, in, houses, built, or, renovated, in, the, 1970s, a, version, known, as, fly, ash, bricks, manufactured, using, fly, ash, lime, and, gypsum, known, as, the, fal, g, process, are, common, in, south, asia, calcium, silicate, bricks, are, also, manufactured, in, canada, and, the, united, states, and, meet, the, criteria, set, forth, in, astm, c73, 10, standard, specification, for, calcium, silicate, brick, sand, lime, brick, bricks, formed, from, concrete, are, usually, termed, as, blocks, or, concrete, masonry, unit, and, are, typically, pale, grey, they, are, made, from, a, dry, small, aggregate, concrete, which, is, formed, in, steel, moulds, by, vibration, and, compaction, in, either, an, egglayer, or, static, machine, the, finished, blocks, are, cured, rather, than, fired, using, low, pressure, steam, concrete, bricks, and, blocks, are, manufactured, in, a, wide, range, of, shapes, sizes, and, face, treatments, a, number, of, which, simulate, the, appearance, of, clay, bricks, concrete, bricks, are, available, in, many, colours, and, as, an, engineering, brick, made, with, sulfate, resisting, portland, cement, or, equivalent, when, made, with, adequate, amount, of, cement, they, are, suitable, for, harsh, environments, such, as, wet, conditions, and, retaining, walls, they, are, made, to, standards, bs, 6073, en, 771, 3, or, astm, c55, concrete, bricks, contract, or, shrink, so, they, need, movement, joints, every, 5, to, 6, metres, but, are, similar, to, other, bricks, of, similar, density, in, thermal, and, sound, resistance, and, fire, resistance, compressed, earth, blocks, are, made, mostly, from, slightly, moistened, local, soils, compressed, with, a, mechanical, hydraulic, press, or, manual, lever, press, a, small, amount, of, a, cement, binder, may, be, added, resulting, in, a, stabilised, compressed, earth, block, there, are, thousands, of, types, of, bricks, that, are, named, for, their, use, size, forming, method, origin, quality, texture, and, or, materials, categorized, by, manufacture, method, categorized, by, use, specialized, use, bricks, bricks, named, for, place, of, origin, for, efficient, handling, and, laying, bricks, must, be, small, enough, and, light, enough, to, be, picked, up, by, the, bricklayer, using, one, hand, leaving, the, other, hand, free, for, the, trowel, bricks, are, usually, laid, flat, and, as, a, result, the, effective, limit, on, the, width, of, a, brick, is, set, by, the, distance, which, can, conveniently, be, spanned, between, the, thumb, and, fingers, of, one, hand, normally, about, 100, mm, 4, in, in, most, cases, the, length, of, a, brick, is, twice, its, width, plus, the, width, of, a, mortar, joint, about, 200, mm, 8, in, or, slightly, more, this, allows, bricks, to, be, laid, bonded, in, a, structure, which, increases, stability, and, strength, for, an, example, see, the, illustration, of, bricks, laid, in, english, bond, at, the, head, of, this, article, the, wall, is, built, using, alternating, courses, of, stretchers, bricks, laid, longways, and, headers, bricks, laid, crossways, the, headers, tie, the, wall, together, over, its, width, in, fact, this, wall, is, built, in, a, variation, of, english, bond, called, english, cross, bond, where, the, successive, layers, of, stretchers, are, displaced, horizontally, from, each, other, by, half, a, brick, length, in, true, english, bond, the, perpendicular, lines, of, the, stretcher, courses, are, in, line, with, each, other, a, bigger, brick, makes, for, a, thicker, and, thus, more, insulating, wall, historically, this, meant, that, bigger, bricks, were, necessary, in, colder, climates, see, for, instance, the, slightly, larger, size, of, the, russian, brick, in, table, below, while, a, smaller, brick, was, adequate, and, more, economical, in, warmer, regions, a, notable, illustration, of, this, correlation, is, the, green, gate, in, gdansk, built, in, 1571, of, imported, dutch, brick, too, small, for, the, colder, climate, of, gdansk, it, was, notorious, for, being, a, chilly, and, drafty, residence, nowadays, this, is, no, longer, an, issue, as, modern, walls, typically, incorporate, specialised, insulation, materials, the, correct, brick, for, a, job, can, be, selected, from, a, choice, of, colour, surface, texture, density, weight, absorption, and, pore, structure, thermal, characteristics, thermal, and, moisture, movement, and, fire, resistance, in, england, the, length, and, width, of, the, common, brick, remained, fairly, constant, from, 1625, when, the, size, was, regulated, by, statute, at, 9, x, 4, 1, 2, x, 3, inches, but, see, brick, tax, but, the, depth, has, varied, from, about, two, inches, 51, mm, or, smaller, in, earlier, times, to, about, 2, 1, 2, inches, 64, mm, more, recently, in, the, united, kingdom, the, usual, size, of, a, modern, brick, from, 1965, is, 215, mm, 102, 5, mm, 65, mm, 8, 1, 2, in, 4, in, 2, 1, 2, in, which, with, a, nominal, 10, millimetres, 3, 8, in, mortar, joint, forms, a, unit, size, of, 225, by, 112, 5, by, 75, millimetres, 9, in, 4, 1, 2, in, 3, in, for, a, ratio, of, 6, 3, 2, in, the, united, states, modern, standard, bricks, are, specified, for, various, uses, the, most, commonly, used, is, the, modular, brick, has, the, actual, dimensions, of, 7, 5, 8, 3, 5, 8, 2, 1, 4, inches, 194, 92, 57, mm, with, the, standard, 3, 8, inch, mortar, joint, this, gives, the, nominal, dimensions, of, 8, x, 4, x, 2, 2, 3, inches, which, eases, the, calculation, of, the, number, of, bricks, in, a, given, wall, the, 2, 1, ratio, of, modular, bricks, means, that, when, they, turn, corners, a, 1, 2, running, bond, is, formed, without, needing, to, cut, the, brick, down, or, fill, the, gap, with, a, cut, brick, and, the, height, of, modular, bricks, means, that, a, soldier, course, matches, the, height, of, three, modular, running, courses, or, one, standard, cmu, course, some, brickmakers, create, innovative, sizes, and, shapes, for, bricks, used, for, plastering, and, therefore, not, visible, on, the, inside, of, the, building, where, their, inherent, mechanical, properties, are, more, important, than, their, visual, ones, these, bricks, are, usually, slightly, larger, but, not, as, large, as, blocks, and, offer, the, following, advantages, blocks, have, a, much, greater, range, of, sizes, standard, co, ordinating, sizes, in, length, and, height, in, mm, include, 400, 200, 450, 150, 450, 200, 450, 225, 450, 300, 600, 150, 600, 200, and, 600, 225, depths, work, size, mm, include, 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and, 250, they, are, usable, across, this, range, as, they, are, lighter, than, clay, bricks, the, density, of, solid, clay, bricks, is, around, 2000, kg, m, 3, this, is, reduced, by, frogging, hollow, bricks, and, so, on, but, aerated, autoclaved, concrete, even, as, a, solid, brick, can, have, densities, in, the, range, of, 450, 850, kg, m, 3, bricks, may, also, be, classified, as, solid, less, than, 25, perforations, by, volume, although, the, brick, may, be, frogged, having, indentations, on, one, of, the, longer, faces, perforated, containing, a, pattern, of, small, holes, through, the, brick, removing, no, more, than, 25, of, the, volume, cellular, containing, a, pattern, of, holes, removing, more, than, 20, of, the, volume, but, closed, on, one, face, or, hollow, containing, a, pattern, of, large, holes, removing, more, than, 25, of, the, brick, s, volume, blocks, may, be, solid, cellular, or, hollow, the, term, frog, can, refer, to, the, indentation, or, the, implement, used, to, make, it, modern, brickmakers, usually, use, plastic, frogs, but, in, the, past, they, were, made, of, wood, the, compressive, strength, of, bricks, produced, in, the, united, states, ranges, from, about, 7, to, 103, mpa, 1, 000, to, 15, 000, lbf, in, 2, varying, according, to, the, use, to, which, the, brick, are, to, be, put, in, england, clay, bricks, can, have, strengths, of, up, to, 100, mpa, although, a, common, house, brick, is, likely, to, show, a, range, of, 20, 40, mpa, bricks, are, a, versatile, building, material, able, to, participate, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, including, in, the, united, states, bricks, have, been, used, for, both, buildings, and, pavement, examples, of, brick, use, in, buildings, can, be, seen, in, colonial, era, buildings, and, other, notable, structures, around, the, country, bricks, have, been, used, in, paving, roads, and, sidewalks, especially, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, the, introduction, of, asphalt, and, concrete, reduced, the, use, of, brick, for, paving, but, they, are, still, sometimes, installed, as, a, method, of, traffic, calming, or, as, a, decorative, surface, in, pedestrian, precincts, for, example, in, the, early, 1900s, most, of, the, streets, in, the, city, of, grand, rapids, michigan, were, paved, with, bricks, today, there, are, only, about, 20, blocks, of, brick, paved, streets, remaining, totalling, less, than, 0, 5, percent, of, all, the, streets, in, the, city, limits, much, like, in, grand, rapids, municipalities, across, the, united, states, began, replacing, brick, streets, with, inexpensive, asphalt, concrete, by, the, mid, 20th, century, in, northwest, europe, bricks, have, been, used, in, construction, for, centuries, until, recently, almost, all, houses, were, built, almost, entirely, from, bricks, although, many, houses, are, now, built, using, a, mixture, of, concrete, blocks, and, other, materials, many, houses, are, skinned, with, a, layer, of, bricks, on, the, outside, for, aesthetic, appeal, bricks, in, the, metallurgy, and, glass, industries, are, often, used, for, lining, furnaces, in, particular, refractory, bricks, such, as, silica, magnesia, chamotte, and, neutral, chromomagnesite, refractory, bricks, this, type, of, brick, must, have, good, thermal, shock, resistance, refractoriness, under, load, high, melting, point, and, satisfactory, porosity, there, is, a, large, refractory, brick, industry, especially, in, the, united, kingdom, japan, the, united, states, belgium, and, the, netherlands, engineering, bricks, are, used, where, strength, low, water, porosity, or, acid, flue, gas, resistance, are, needed, in, the, uk, a, red, brick, university, is, one, founded, in, the, late, 19th, or, early, 20th, century, the, term, is, used, to, refer, to, such, institutions, collectively, to, distinguish, them, from, the, older, oxbridge, institutions, and, refers, to, the, use, of, bricks, as, opposed, to, stone, in, their, buildings, colombian, architect, rogelio, salmona, was, noted, for, his, extensive, use, of, red, bricks, in, his, buildings, and, for, using, natural, shapes, like, spirals, radial, geometry, and, curves, in, his, designs, starting, in, the, 20th, century, the, use, of, brickwork, declined, in, some, areas, due, to, concerns, about, earthquakes, earthquakes, such, as, the, san, francisco, earthquake, of, 1906, and, the, 1933, long, beach, earthquake, revealed, the, weaknesses, of, unreinforced, brick, masonry, in, earthquake, prone, areas, during, seismic, events, the, mortar, cracks, and, crumbles, so, that, the, bricks, are, no, longer, held, together, brick, masonry, with, steel, reinforcement, which, helps, hold, the, masonry, together, during, earthquakes, has, been, used, to, replace, unreinforced, bricks, in, many, buildings, retrofitting, older, unreinforced, masonry, structures, has, been, mandated, in, many, jurisdictions, however, similar, to, steel, corrosion, in, reinforced, concrete, rebar, rusting, will, compromise, the, structural, integrity, of, reinforced, brick, and, ultimately, limit, the, expected, lifetime, so, there, is, a, trade, off, between, earthquake, safety, and, longevity, to, a, certain, extent, the, united, states, access, board, does, not, specify, which, materials, a, sidewalk, must, be, made, of, in, order, to, be, ada, compliant, but, states, that, sidewalks, must, not, have, surface, variances, of, greater, than, one, inch, due, to, the, accessibility, challenges, of, bricks, the, federal, highway, administration, recommends, against, the, use, of, bricks, as, well, as, cobblestones, in, its, accessibility, guide, for, sidewalks, and, crosswalks, the, brick, industry, association, maintains, standards, for, making, brick, more, accessible, for, disabled, people, with, proper, and, regular, maintenance, being, necessary, to, keep, brick, accessible, some, us, jurisdictions, such, as, san, francisco, have, taken, steps, to, remove, brick, sidewalks, from, certain, areas, such, as, market, street, in, order, to, improve, accessibility
