a, pier, is, a, raised, structure, that, rises, above, a, body, of, water, and, usually, juts, out, from, its, shore, typically, supported, by, piles, or, pillars, and, provides, above, water, access, to, offshore, areas, frequent, pier, uses, include, fishing, boat, docking, and, access, for, both, passengers, and, cargo, and, oceanside, recreation, bridges, buildings, and, walkways, may, all, be, supported, by, architectural, piers, their, open, structure, allows, tides, and, currents, to, flow, relatively, unhindered, whereas, the, more, solid, foundations, of, a, quay, or, the, closely, spaced, piles, of, a, wharf, can, act, as, a, breakwater, and, are, consequently, more, liable, to, silting, piers, can, range, in, size, and, complexity, from, a, simple, lightweight, wooden, structure, to, major, structures, extended, over, 1, 600, m, 5, 200, ft, in, american, english, a, pier, may, be, synonymous, with, a, dock, piers, have, been, built, for, several, purposes, and, because, these, different, purposes, have, distinct, regional, variances, the, term, pier, tends, to, have, different, nuances, of, meaning, in, different, parts, of, the, world, thus, in, north, america, and, australia, where, many, ports, were, until, recently, built, on, the, multiple, pier, model, the, term, tends, to, imply, a, current, or, former, cargo, handling, facility, in, contrast, in, europe, where, ports, more, often, use, basins, and, river, side, quays, than, piers, the, term, is, principally, associated, with, the, image, of, a, victorian, cast, iron, pleasure, pier, however, the, earliest, piers, pre, date, the, victorian, age, piers, can, be, categorized, into, different, groupings, according, to, the, principal, purpose, however, there, is, considerable, overlap, between, these, categories, for, example, pleasure, piers, often, also, allow, for, the, docking, of, pleasure, steamers, and, other, similar, craft, while, working, piers, have, often, been, converted, to, leisure, use, after, being, rendered, obsolete, by, advanced, developments, in, cargo, handling, technology, many, piers, are, floating, piers, to, ensure, that, the, piers, raise, and, lower, with, the, tide, along, with, the, boats, tied, to, them, this, prevents, a, situation, where, lines, become, overly, taut, or, loose, by, rising, or, lowering, tides, an, overly, taut, or, loose, tie, line, can, damage, boats, by, pulling, them, out, of, the, water, or, allowing, them, so, much, leeway, that, they, bang, forcefully, against, the, sides, of, the, pier, working, piers, were, built, for, the, handling, of, passengers, and, cargo, onto, and, off, ships, or, as, at, wigan, pier, canal, boats, working, piers, themselves, fall, into, two, different, groups, longer, individual, piers, are, often, found, at, ports, with, large, tidal, ranges, with, the, pier, stretching, far, enough, off, shore, to, reach, deep, water, at, low, tide, such, piers, provided, an, economical, alternative, to, impounded, docks, where, cargo, volumes, were, low, or, where, specialist, bulk, cargo, was, handled, such, as, at, coal, piers, the, other, form, of, working, pier, often, called, the, finger, pier, was, built, at, ports, with, smaller, tidal, ranges, here, the, principal, advantage, was, to, give, a, greater, available, quay, length, for, ships, to, berth, against, compared, to, a, linear, littoral, quayside, and, such, piers, are, usually, much, shorter, typically, each, pier, would, carry, a, single, transit, shed, the, length, of, the, pier, with, ships, berthing, bow, or, stern, in, to, the, shore, some, major, ports, consisted, of, large, numbers, of, such, piers, lining, the, foreshore, classic, examples, being, the, hudson, river, frontage, of, new, york, or, the, embarcadero, in, san, francisco, the, advent, of, container, shipping, with, its, need, for, large, container, handling, spaces, adjacent, to, the, shipping, berths, has, made, working, piers, obsolete, for, the, handling, of, general, cargo, although, some, still, survive, for, the, handling, of, passenger, ships, or, bulk, cargos, one, example, is, in, use, in, progreso, yucat, n, where, a, pier, extends, more, than, 4, miles, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, making, it, the, longest, pier, in, the, world, the, progreso, pier, supplies, much, of, the, peninsula, with, transportation, for, the, fishing, and, cargo, industries, and, serves, as, a, port, for, large, cruise, ships, in, the, area, many, other, working, piers, have, been, demolished, or, remain, derelict, but, some, have, been, recycled, as, pleasure, piers, the, best, known, example, of, this, is, pier, 39, in, san, francisco, at, southport, and, the, tweed, river, on, the, gold, coast, in, australia, there, are, piers, that, support, equipment, for, a, sand, bypassing, system, that, maintains, the, health, of, sandy, beaches, and, navigation, channels, pleasure, piers, were, first,
