https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley
a, galley, was, a, type, of, ship, which, relied, mostly, on, oars, for, propulsion, that, was, used, for, warfare, trade, and, piracy, mostly, in, the, seas, surrounding, europe, it, developed, in, the, mediterranean, world, during, antiquity, and, continued, to, exist, in, various, forms, until, the, early, 19th, century, it, typically, had, a, long, slender, hull, shallow, draft, and, often, a, low, freeboard, most, types, of, galleys, also, had, sails, that, could, be, used, in, favourable, winds, but, they, relied, primarily, on, oars, to, move, independently, of, winds, and, currents, the, term, galley, originated, from, a, greek, term, for, a, small, type, of, galley, and, came, in, use, in, english, from, about, 1300, it, has, occasionally, been, used, for, unrelated, vessels, with, similar, military, functions, as, galley, but, which, were, not, mediterranean, in, origin, such, as, medieval, scandinavian, longships, 16th, century, acehnese, ghalis, and, 18th, century, north, american, gunboats, galleys, were, the, primary, warships, used, by, the, ancient, mediterranean, naval, powers, including, the, phoenicians, greeks, and, romans, the, galley, remained, the, dominant, type, of, vessel, used, for, war, and, piracy, in, the, mediterranean, sea, until, the, start, of, the, early, modern, period, a, final, revival, of, galley, warfare, occurred, during, the, 18th, century, in, the, baltic, sea, during, the, wars, between, russia, sweden, and, denmark, in, the, mediterranean, they, remained, in, use, until, the, very, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, survived, in, part, because, of, their, prestige, and, association, with, chivalry, and, land, warfare, in, war, galleys, were, used, in, landing, raids, as, troop, transports, and, were, very, effective, in, amphibious, warfare, while, they, usually, served, in, wars, or, for, defense, against, piracy, galleys, also, served, as, trade, vessels, for, high, priority, or, expensive, goods, up, to, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, its, oars, guaranteed, that, it, could, make, progress, where, a, sailing, ship, would, have, been, becalmed, and, its, large, crew, could, defend, it, against, attacks, from, pirates, and, raiders, this, also, made, it, one, of, the, safest, and, most, reliable, forms, of, passenger, transport, especially, for, christian, pilgrims, during, the, high, and, late, middle, ages, for, naval, combat, galleys, were, equipped, with, various, weapons, rams, and, occasionally, catapults, until, late, antiquity, greek, fire, during, the, early, middle, ages, and, cannons, from, the, 15th, century, however, they, relied, primarily, on, their, large, crews, to, overpower, enemy, vessels, through, boarding, galleys, were, the, first, vessels, to, effectively, use, heavy, gunpowder, artillery, against, other, ships, and, naval, fortifications, early, 16th, century, galleys, had, heavy, guns, in, the, bow, which, were, aimed, by, manoeuvring, the, entire, vessel, initially, gun, galleys, posed, a, serious, threat, to, sailing, warships, but, were, gradually, made, obsolete, by, the, development, of, full, rigged, ships, with, superior, broadside, armament, galleys, were, unsuitable, in, the, wider, ocean, far, from, land, and, bases, of, resupply, they, had, difficulty, in, rough, weather, their, role, as, flexible, cruisers, and, patrol, craft, in, the, mediterranean, was, also, taken, over, by, xebecs, and, other, oar, sail, hybrids, oars, on, ancient, galleys, were, usually, arranged, in, 15, 30, pairs, from, monoremes, with, a, single, line, of, oars, to, triremes, with, three, lines, of, oars, in, a, tiered, arrangement, occasionally, much, larger, polyremes, had, multiple, rowers, per, oar, and, hundreds, of, rowers, per, galley, ancient, shipwrights, built, galleys, using, a, labour, intensive, shell, first, mortise, and, tenon, technique, up, until, the, early, middle, ages, it, was, gradually, replaced, by, a, less, expensive, skeleton, first, carvel, method, the, rowing, setup, was, also, simplified, and, eventually, developed, into, a, system, called, alla, sensile, with, up, to, three, rowers, sharing, a, single, bench, handling, one, oar, each, this, was, suitable, for, skilled, professional, rowers, this, was, further, simplified, to, the, a, scaloccio, method, with, rowers, sharing, a, bench, but, using, just, a, single, large, oar, sometimes, with, up, to, seven, or, more, rowers, per, oar, in, the, very, largest, war, galleys, this, method, was, more, suitable, for, the, use, of, forced, labour, both, galley, slaves, and, convicts, most, galleys, were, equipped, with, sails, that, could, be, used, when, the, wind, was, favourable, basic, square, sails, until, the, early, middle, ages, and, later, lateen, sails, the, word, galley, has, been, attested, in, english, from, about, 1300, variants, of, the, same, term, were, established, in, many, other, european, languages, from, around, 1500, both, as, a, general, term, for, oared, warships, or, more, specifically, for, the, mediterranean, style, vessel, the, term, derives, from, the, medieval, greek, galea, a, smaller, version, of, the, dromon, the, prime, warship, of, the, byzantine, navy, the, origin, of, the, greek, word, is, unclear, but, could, possibly, be, related, to, galeos, the, greek, word, for, dogfish, shark, throughout, history, there, has, been, a, wide, variety, of, terms, used, for, different, types, of, galleys, in, modern, historical, literature, a, galley, is, defined, as, a, vessel, relying, primarily, on, oars, but, which, can, also, use, sails, when, necessary, and, which, developed, in, the, mediterranean, galley, is, also, occasionally, used, as, a, generic, term, for, any, type, of, oared, vessels, that, are, larger, than, boats, and, with, similar, functions, but, which, are, built, according, to, other, shipbuilding, traditions, it, was, only, from, the, late, middle, ages, that, a, unified, galley, concept, started, to, come, into, use, ancient, galleys, were, named, according, to, the, number, of, oars, the, number, of, banks, of, oars, or, rows, of, rowers, the, terms, are, based, on, contemporary, language, use, combined, with, recent, compounds, of, greek, and, latin, words, the, earliest, greek, single, banked, galleys, are, called, triaconters, from, triakontoroi, thirty, oars, and, penteconters, pent, kontoroi, fifty, oars, for, later, galleys, with, more, than, one, bank, of, oars, the, terminology, is, based, on, latin, numerals, with, the, suffix, reme, from, r, mus, oar, a, monoreme, has, one, bank, of, oars, a, bireme, two, and, a, trireme, three, a, human, powered, oared, vessel, is, not, practically, feasible, as, four, or, more, oars, to, a, bank, will, either, interfere, with, each, other, or, be, too, high, above, the, waterline, to, be, practicable, in, describing, galleys, any, number, higher, than, three, did, not, refer, to, banks, of, oars, but, to, additional, rowers, per, oar, quinquereme, quintus, r, mus, was, literally, a, five, oar, but, actually, meant, that, there, were, more, than, one, rower, per, oar, in, a, bireme, or, trireme, arrangement, for, simplicity, many, modern, scholars, refer, to, these, as, fives, sixes, eights, elevens, etc, anything, above, six, or, seven, rows, of, rowers, was, uncommon, but, even, an, entirely, unique, forty, has, been, attested, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, any, galley, with, more, than, three, or, four, lines, of, rowers, is, often, referred, to, as, a, polyreme, medieval, and, early, modern, galleys, were, described, based, on, the, changing, designs, that, evolved, after, the, ancient, designs, and, rowing, arrangement, had, been, forgotten, among, the, most, important, is, the, byzantine, dromon, the, predecessor, to, the, italian, galea, sottile, the, final, form, of, the, mediterranean, war, galley, as, galleys, became, an, integral, part, of, an, advanced, early, modern, system, of, warfare, and, state, administration, they, were, divided, into, a, number, of, ranked, grades, based, on, the, size, of, the, vessel, and, the, number, of, its, crew, the, most, basic, types, were, the, large, commander, lantern, galleys, half, galleys, galiots, fustas, brigantines, and, fregatas, naval, historian, jan, glete, has, described, these, as, a, sort, of, predecessor, of, the, later, rating, system, of, the, royal, navy, and, other, sailing, fleets, in, northern, europe, classicist, lionel, casson, has, applied, the, term, galley, to, oared, viking, ships, of, the, early, and, high, middle, ages, both, their, well, known, longship, warships, and, their, less, familiar, merchant, galleys, oared, military, vessels, built, on, the, british, isles, in, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, were, based, on, scandinavian, designs, but, were, referred, to, as, galleys, because, of, the, similarity, in, function, many, of, them, were, similar, to, birlinns, a, smaller, version, of, the, highland, galley, close, relatives, of, longship, types, like, the, snekkja, by, the, 14th, century, they, were, replaced, with, balingers, in, southern, britain, while, longship, type, highland, and, irish, galleys, and, birlinns, remained, in, use, throughout, the, middle, ages, in, northern, britain, the, french, navy, and, the, royal, navy, built, a, series, of, galley, frigates, from, around, 1670, 1690, that, were, small, two, decked, sailing, cruisers, with, a, single, row, of, oarports, on, the, lower, deck, close, to, the, waterline, the, three, british, galley, frigates, also, had, distinctive, names, james, galley, charles, galley, and, mary, galley, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, term, galley, was, sometimes, used, to, describe, small, oared, gun, armed, vessels, in, north, america, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, other, wars, with, france, and, britain, the, early, us, navy, and, the, navies, they, fought, built, vessels, that, were, referred, to, galleys, or, row, galleys, these, are, today, best, described, as, brigantines, or, baltic, style, gunboats, the, north, american, galleys, were, classified, based, on, their, military, role, and, in, part, due, to, technicalities, in, administration, and, naval, financing, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, royal, navy, term, for, the, gig, a, ship, s, boat, optimised, for, propulsion, by, oar, reserved, for, the, captain, s, use, was, galley, even, though, it, was, issued, to, the, ship, by, the, navy, dockyard, as, a, gig, among, the, earliest, known, watercraft, were, canoes, made, from, hollowed, out, logs, the, earliest, ancestors, of, galleys, their, narrow, hulls, required, them, to, be, paddled, in, a, fixed, sitting, position, facing, forward, a, less, efficient, form, of, propulsion, than, rowing, with, proper, oars, facing, backward, seagoing, paddled, craft, have, been, attested, by, finds, of, terracotta, sculptures, and, lead, models, in, the, region, of, the, aegean, sea, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, however, archaeologists, believe, that, the, stone, age, colonization, of, islands, in, the, mediterranean, around, 8, 000, bc, required, larger, seaworthy, vessels, that, were, paddled, and, possibly, even, equipped, with, sails, the, first, evidence, of, more, complex, craft, considered, prototypes, for, later, galleys, comes, from, ancient, egypt, during, the, old, kingdom, about, 2700, 2200, bc, under, the, rule, of, pharaoh, pepi, i, 2332, 2283, bc, these, vessels, were, used, to, transport, troops, to, raid, settlements, along, the, levantine, coast, and, to, ship, back, slaves, and, timber, during, the, reign, of, hatshepsut, about, 1479, 1457, bc, egyptian, galleys, traded, in, luxuries, on, the, red, sea, with, the, enigmatic, land, of, punt, as, recorded, on, wall, paintings, at, the, mortuary, temple, of, hatshepsut, at, deir, el, bahari, the, first, greek, galley, like, ships, appeared, around, the, second, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, in, the, epic, poem, the, iliad, set, in, the, 12th, century, bc, oared, vessels, with, a, single, row, of, oarmen, were, used, primarily, to, transport, soldiers, between, land, battles, the, first, recorded, naval, battle, occurred, as, early, as, 1175, bc, the, battle, of, the, delta, between, egyptian, forces, under, ramesses, iii, and, the, enigmatic, alliance, known, as, the, sea, peoples, it, is, the, first, known, engagement, between, organized, armed, forces, using, sea, vessels, as, weapons, of, war, though, primarily, as, fighting, platforms, the, phoenicians, were, among, the, most, significant, naval, civilizations, in, early, classical, antiquity, but, little, detailed, evidence, has, been, found, of, what, kind, of, ships, they, used, the, best, depictions, found, so, far, have, been, small, highly, stylized, images, on, seals, which, illustrate, crescent, shaped, vessels, equipped, with, a, single, mast, and, bank, of, oars, colorful, frescoes, at, the, minoan, settlement, on, santorini, about, 1600, bc, depict, vessels, with, tents, arranged, in, a, ceremonial, procession, some, of, the, vessels, are, rowed, but, others, are, paddled, this, has, been, interpreted, as, a, possible, ritual, reenactment, of, more, ancient, types, of, vessels, alluding, to, a, time, before, rowing, was, invented, little, is, otherwise, known, about, the, use, and, design, of, minoan, ships, mediterranean, galleys, from, around, the, 9th, century, typically, had, 15, and, 25, pairs, of, oars, triaconters, and, penteconters, respectively, with, just, one, level, of, oars, on, each, side, or, monoremes, sometime, during, the, 8th, century, the, first, bireme, galleys, were, built, by, adding, a, second, level, of, rowers, one, level, above, the, other, this, created, a, second, bank, of, oars, adding, more, propulsion, power, with, the, same, length, of, hull, it, made, galleys, faster, more, maneuverable, and, sturdier, phoenician, shipbuilders, were, likely, the, first, to, build, two, level, galleys, and, bireme, designs, were, soon, adopted, and, further, developed, by, the, greeks, a, third, bank, of, oar, was, added, by, attaching, an, outrigger, to, a, bireme, the, outrigger, was, a, projecting, frame, that, gave, additional, leverage, for, a, third, rower, to, handle, an, oar, efficiently, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, early, forms, of, three, banked, ships, may, have, existed, as, early, as, 700, bc, but, the, earliest, conclusive, written, reference, dates, to, 542, bc, these, new, galleys, were, called, tri, r, s, literally, three, fitted, in, greek, romans, later, applied, the, term, triremis, which, is, the, origin, of, trireme, and, the, name, used, most, commonly, today, until, at, least, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, there, was, no, clear, distinction, between, ships, of, trade, and, war, other, than, how, they, were, used, river, boats, plied, the, waterways, of, ancient, egypt, during, the, old, kingdom, 2700, 2200, bc, and, seagoing, galley, like, vessels, were, recorded, bringing, back, luxuries, from, across, the, red, sea, in, the, reign, of, pharaoh, hatshepsut, when, rams, or, cutwaters, were, fitted, to, the, bows, of, warships, sometime, around, 700, bc, it, resulted, in, a, more, distinct, split, between, warships, and, trade, ships, phoenicians, used, galleys, for, trade, that, were, less, elongated, carried, fewer, oars, and, relied, more, on, sails, carthaginian, trade, galley, wrecks, found, off, sicily, that, date, to, the, 3rd, or, 2nd, century, bc, had, a, length, to, breadth, ratio, of, 6, 1, proportions, that, fell, between, the, 4, 1, of, sailing, merchant, ships, and, the, 8, 1, or, 10, 1, of, war, galleys, most, of, the, surviving, documentary, evidence, comes, from, greek, and, roman, shipping, though, it, is, likely, that, merchant, galleys, all, over, the, mediterranean, were, highly, similar, in, greek, they, were, referred, to, as, histiokopos, sail, oar, er, to, reflect, that, they, relied, on, both, types, of, propulsion, in, latin, they, were, called, actuaria, navis, ship, that, moves, stressing, that, they, were, capable, of, making, progress, regardless, of, weather, conditions, as, an, example, of, the, speed, and, reliability, during, an, instance, of, the, famous, carthago, delenda, est, speech, cato, the, elder, demonstrated, the, close, proximity, of, the, roman, arch, enemy, carthage, by, displaying, a, fresh, fig, to, his, audience, that, he, claimed, had, been, picked, in, north, africa, only, three, days, past, other, cargoes, carried, by, galleys, were, honey, cheese, meat, and, live, animals, intended, for, gladiator, combat, the, romans, had, several, types, of, merchant, galleys, that, specialized, in, various, tasks, out, of, which, the, actuaria, with, up, to, 50, rowers, was, the, most, versatile, including, the, phaselus, lit, bean, pod, for, passenger, transport, and, the, lembus, a, small, scale, express, carrier, many, of, these, designs, continued, to, be, used, until, the, middle, ages, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, around, the, 5th, century, ad, the, old, mediterranean, economy, collapsed, and, the, volume, of, trade, went, down, drastically, the, eastern, roman, empire, neglected, to, revive, overland, trade, routes, but, was, dependent, on, keeping, the, sea, lanes, open, to, keep, the, empire, together, in, 600, 750, ad, bulk, trade, declined, while, luxury, trade, increased, galleys, remained, in, service, but, were, profitable, mainly, in, the, luxury, trade, which, set, off, their, high, maintenance, cost, in, the, 10th, century, there, was, a, sharp, increase, in, piracy, which, resulted, in, larger, trade, ships, with, more, numerous, crews, these, were, mostly, built, by, the, growing, maritime, republics, of, italy, which, were, emerging, as, the, dominant, sea, powers, including, venice, genoa, and, pisa, their, merchant, galleys, were, similar, to, dromons, but, without, heavy, weapons, and, both, faster, and, wider, the, largest, types, were, used, by, venice, based, on, galley, types, like, the, pamphylon, and, chelandion, they, had, tower, like, superstructures, and, could, be, manned, by, crews, of, up, to, 1, 000, men, and, could, be, employed, in, warfare, when, required, a, further, boost, to, the, development, of, the, large, merchant, galleys, was, the, increase, in, western, european, pilgrims, traveling, to, the, holy, land, in, northern, europe, viking, longships, and, their, derivations, knarrs, dominated, trading, and, shipping, they, functioned, and, were, propelled, similar, to, the, mediterranean, galleys, but, developed, from, a, separate, building, tradition, in, the, mediterranean, merchant, galleys, continued, to, be, used, during, the, high, and, late, middle, ages, even, as, sailing, vessels, evolved, more, efficient, hulls, and, rigging, the, zenith, in, the, design, of, merchant, galleys, came, with, the, state, owned, great, galleys, of, the, venetian, republic, first, built, in, the, 1290s, the, great, galleys, were, in, all, respects, larger, than, contemporary, war, galleys, up, to, 46, m, and, had, a, deeper, draft, with, more, room, for, cargo, 140, 250, tonnes, with, a, full, complement, of, rowers, ranging, from, 150, to, 180, men, all, available, to, defend, the, ship, from, attack, they, were, also, very, safe, modes, of, travel, this, attracted, a, business, of, carrying, rich, pilgrims, to, the, holy, land, a, trip, that, could, be, accomplished, in, as, little, 29, days, on, the, route, venice, jaffa, despite, landfalls, for, rest, and, watering, or, to, shelter, from, rough, weather, later, routes, linked, ports, around, the, mediterranean, between, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, and, between, the, mediterranean, and, bruges, in, 1447, florentine, galleys, could, stop, at, as, many, as, 14, ports, on, their, way, to, and, from, alexandria, in, egypt, the, earliest, use, for, galleys, in, warfare, was, to, ferry, fighters, from, one, place, to, another, and, until, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, had, no, real, distinction, from, merchant, freighters, around, the, 14th, century, bc, the, first, dedicated, fighting, ships, were, developed, sleeker, and, with, cleaner, lines, than, the, bulkier, merchants, they, were, used, for, raiding, capturing, merchants, and, for, dispatches, during, this, early, period, raiding, became, the, most, important, form, of, organized, violence, in, the, mediterranean, region, casson, used, the, example, of, homer, s, works, to, show, that, seaborne, raiding, was, considered, a, common, and, legitimate, occupation, among, ancient, maritime, peoples, the, later, athenian, historian, thucydides, described, it, as, having, been, without, stigma, before, his, time, the, development, of, the, ram, sometime, before, the, 8th, century, bc, changed, the, nature, of, naval, warfare, which, had, until, then, been, a, matter, of, boarding, and, hand, to, hand, fighting, with, a, heavy, projection, at, the, foot, of, the, bow, sheathed, with, metal, usually, bronze, a, ship, could, incapacitate, an, enemy, ship, by, punching, a, hole, in, its, planking, the, relative, speed, and, nimbleness, of, ships, became, important, since, a, slower, ship, could, be, outmaneuvered, and, disabled, by, a, faster, one, the, earliest, designs, had, only, one, row, of, rowers, that, sat, in, undecked, hulls, rowing, against, thole, pins, or, oarports, that, were, placed, directly, along, the, railings, the, practical, upper, limit, for, wooden, constructions, fast, and, maneuverable, enough, for, warfare, was, around, 25, 30, oars, per, side, by, adding, another, level, of, oars, a, development, that, occurred, no, later, than, c, 750, bc, the, galley, could, be, made, shorter, with, as, many, rowers, while, making, them, strong, enough, to, be, effective, ramming, weapons, the, emergence, of, more, advanced, states, and, intensified, competition, between, them, spurred, on, the, development, of, advanced, galleys, with, multiple, banks, of, rowers, during, the, middle, of, the, first, millennium, bc, the, mediterranean, powers, developed, successively, larger, and, more, complex, vessels, the, most, advanced, being, the, classical, trireme, with, up, to, 170, rowers, triremes, fought, several, important, engagements, in, the, naval, battles, of, the, greco, persian, wars, 502, 449, bc, and, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, including, the, battle, of, aegospotami, in, 405, bc, which, sealed, the, defeat, of, athens, by, sparta, and, its, allies, the, trireme, was, an, advanced, ship, that, was, expensive, to, build, and, to, maintain, due, its, large, crew, by, the, 5th, century, advanced, war, galleys, had, been, developed, that, required, sizable, states, with, an, advanced, economy, to, build, and, maintain, it, was, associated, with, the, latest, in, warship, technology, around, the, 4th, century, bc, and, could, only, be, employed, by, an, advanced, state, with, an, advanced, economy, and, administration, they, required, considerable, skill, to, row, and, oarsmen, were, mostly, free, citizens, who, had, years, of, experience, at, the, oar, as, civilizations, around, the, mediterranean, grew, in, size, and, complexity, both, their, navies, and, the, galleys, that, made, up, their, numbers, became, successively, larger, the, basic, design, of, two, or, three, rows, of, oars, remained, the, same, but, more, rowers, were, added, to, each, oar, the, exact, reasons, are, not, known, but, are, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, addition, of, more, troops, and, the, use, of, more, advanced, ranged, weapons, on, ships, such, as, catapults, the, size, of, the, new, naval, forces, also, made, it, difficult, to, find, enough, skilled, rowers, for, the, one, man, per, oar, system, of, the, earliest, triremes, with, more, than, one, man, per, oar, a, single, rower, could, set, the, pace, for, the, others, to, follow, meaning, that, more, unskilled, rowers, could, be, employed, the, successor, states, of, alexander, the, great, s, empire, built, galleys, that, were, like, triremes, or, biremes, in, oar, layout, but, manned, with, additional, rowers, for, each, oar, the, ruler, dionysius, i, of, syracuse, c, 432, 367, bc, is, credited, with, pioneering, the, five, and, six, meaning, five, or, six, rows, of, rowers, plying, two, or, three, rows, of, oars, ptolemy, ii, 283, 46, bc, is, known, to, have, built, a, large, fleet, of, very, large, galleys, with, several, experimental, designs, rowed, by, everything, from, 12, up, to, 40, rows, of, rowers, though, most, of, these, are, considered, to, have, been, quite, impractical, fleets, with, large, galleys, were, put, in, action, in, conflicts, such, as, the, punic, wars, 246, 146, bc, between, the, roman, republic, and, carthage, which, included, massive, naval, battles, with, hundreds, of, vessels, and, tens, of, thousands, of, soldiers, seamen, and, rowers, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, between, the, forces, of, augustus, and, mark, antony, marked, the, peak, of, the, roman, fleet, arm, after, augustus, victory, at, actium, most, of, the, roman, fleet, was, dismantled, and, burned, the, roman, civil, wars, were, fought, mostly, by, land, forces, and, from, the, 160s, until, the, 4th, century, ad, no, major, fleet, actions, were, recorded, during, this, time, most, of, the, galley, crews, were, disbanded, or, employed, for, entertainment, purposes, in, mock, battles, or, in, handling, the, sail, like, sun, screens, in, the, larger, roman, arenas, what, fleets, remained, were, treated, as, auxiliaries, of, the, land, forces, and, galley, crewmen, themselves, called, themselves, milites, soldiers, rather, than, nautae, sailors, the, roman, galley, fleets, were, turned, into, provincial, patrol, forces, that, were, smaller, and, relied, largely, on, liburnians, compact, biremes, with, 25, pairs, of, oars, these, were, named, after, an, illyrian, tribe, known, by, romans, for, their, sea, roving, practices, and, these, smaller, craft, were, based, on, or, inspired, by, their, vessels, of, choice, the, liburnians, and, other, small, galleys, patrolled, the, rivers, of, continental, europe, and, reached, as, far, as, the, baltic, where, they, were, used, to, fight, local, uprisings, and, assist, in, checking, foreign, invasions, the, romans, maintained, numerous, bases, around, the, empire, along, the, rivers, of, central, europe, chains, of, forts, along, the, northern, european, coasts, and, the, british, isles, mesopotamia, and, north, africa, including, trabzon, vienna, belgrade, dover, seleucia, and, alexandria, few, actual, galley, battles, in, the, provinces, are, found, in, records, one, action, in, 70, ad, at, the, unspecified, location, of, the, island, of, the, batavians, during, the, batavian, rebellion, was, recorded, and, included, a, trireme, as, the, roman, flagship, the, last, provincial, fleet, the, classis, britannica, was, reduced, by, the, late, 200s, though, there, was, a, minor, upswing, under, the, rule, of, constantine, 272, 337, his, rule, also, saw, the, last, major, naval, battle, of, the, unified, roman, empire, before, the, permanent, split, into, western, and, eastern, empires, the, battle, of, the, hellespont, of, 324, some, time, after, the, battle, of, the, hellespont, the, classical, trireme, fell, out, of, use, and, its, design, was, forgotten, a, transition, from, galley, to, sailing, vessels, as, the, most, common, types, of, warships, began, in, the, high, middle, ages, c, 11th, century, large, high, sided, sailing, ships, had, always, been, formidable, obstacles, for, galleys, to, low, freeboard, oared, vessels, the, bulkier, sailing, ships, the, cog, and, the, carrack, were, almost, like, floating, fortresses, being, difficult, to, board, and, even, harder, to, capture, galleys, remained, useful, as, warships, throughout, the, entire, middle, ages, because, of, their, maneuverability, sailing, ships, of, the, time, had, only, one, mast, usually, with, just, a, single, large, square, sail, this, made, them, cumbersome, to, steer, though, equipped, to, beat, to, windward, their, performance, at, this, would, have, been, limited, galleys, were, therefore, important, for, coastal, raiding, and, amphibious, landings, both, key, elements, of, medieval, warfare, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, byzantine, empire, struggled, with, the, incursion, from, invading, muslim, arabs, from, the, 7th, century, leading, to, fierce, competition, a, buildup, of, fleet, and, war, galleys, of, increasing, size, soon, after, conquering, egypt, and, the, levant, the, arab, rulers, built, ships, highly, similar, to, byzantine, dromons, with, the, help, of, local, coptic, shipwrights, from, former, byzantine, naval, bases, by, the, 9th, century, the, struggle, between, the, byzantines, and, arabs, had, turned, the, eastern, mediterranean, into, a, no, man, s, land, for, merchant, activity, in, the, 820s, crete, was, captured, by, al, andalus, muslims, who, had, fled, a, failed, revolt, against, the, emirate, of, cordoba, turning, the, island, into, a, base, for, galley, attacks, on, christian, shipping, until, the, island, was, recaptured, by, the, byzantines, in, 960, in, the, western, mediterranean, and, atlantic, the, division, of, the, carolingian, empire, in, the, late, 9th, century, brought, on, a, period, of, instability, meaning, increased, piracy, and, raiding, in, the, mediterranean, particularly, by, newly, arrived, muslim, invaders, the, situation, was, worsened, by, raiding, scandinavian, vikings, who, used, longships, vessels, that, in, many, ways, were, very, close, to, galleys, in, design, and, functionality, and, also, employed, similar, tactics, to, counter, the, threat, local, rulers, began, to, build, large, oared, vessels, some, with, up, to, 30, pairs, of, oars, that, were, larger, faster, and, with, higher, sides, than, viking, ships, scandinavian, expansion, including, incursions, into, the, mediterranean, and, attacks, on, both, muslim, iberia, and, even, constantinople, itself, subsided, by, the, mid, 11th, century, by, this, time, greater, stability, in, merchant, traffic, was, achieved, by, the, emergence, of, christian, kingdoms, such, as, those, of, france, hungary, and, poland, around, the, same, time, italian, port, towns, and, city, states, like, venice, pisa, and, amalfi, rose, on, the, fringes, of, the, byzantine, empire, as, it, struggled, with, eastern, threats, late, medieval, maritime, warfare, was, divided, in, two, distinct, regions, in, the, mediterranean, galleys, were, used, for, raiding, along, coasts, and, in, the, constant, fighting, for, naval, bases, in, the, atlantic, and, baltic, there, was, greater, focus, on, sailing, ships, that, were, used, mostly, for, troop, transport, with, galleys, providing, fighting, support, galleys, were, still, widely, used, in, the, north, and, were, the, most, numerous, warships, used, by, mediterranean, powers, with, interests, in, the, north, especially, france, the, iberian, kingdoms, and, the, italian, merchant, republics, the, kings, of, france, operated, the, clos, de, gal, es, literally, galley, enclosure, in, rouen, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, where, they, had, southern, style, war, galleys, built, the, clos, was, built, by, genoese, in, 1298, and, they, continued, to, dominate, shipbuilding, there, until, its, destruction, in, 1419, so, that, they, wouldn, t, fall, into, english, hands, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, century, the, galley, evolved, into, the, design, that, was, to, remain, essentially, the, same, until, it, was, phased, out, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, new, type, descended, from, the, ships, used, by, byzantine, and, muslim, fleets, in, the, early, middle, ages, these, were, the, mainstay, of, all, christian, powers, until, the, 14th, century, including, the, great, maritime, republics, of, genoa, and, venice, the, papacy, the, hospitallers, aragon, and, castile, as, well, as, by, various, pirates, and, corsairs, the, overall, term, used, for, these, types, of, vessels, was, gallee, sottili, slender, galleys, the, later, ottoman, navy, used, similar, designs, but, they, were, generally, faster, under, sail, and, smaller, but, slower, under, oars, galley, designs, were, intended, solely, for, close, action, with, hand, held, weapons, and, projectile, weapons, like, bows, and, crossbows, in, the, 13th, century, the, iberian, crown, of, aragon, built, several, fleet, of, galleys, with, high, castles, manned, with, catalan, crossbowmen, and, regularly, defeated, numerically, superior, angevin, forces, during, the, early, 15th, century, sailing, ships, began, to, dominate, naval, warfare, in, northern, waters, while, the, galley, still, remained, the, primary, warship, in, southern, waters, a, similar, transition, had, begun, also, among, the, mediterranean, powers, a, castilian, naval, raid, on, the, island, of, jersey, in, 1405, became, the, first, recorded, battle, where, a, mediterranean, power, employed, a, naval, force, consisting, mostly, of, cogs, or, carracks, rather, than, the, oared, powered, galleys, the, battle, of, gibraltar, between, castile, and, portugal, in, 1476, was, another, important, sign, of, change, it, was, the, first, recorded, battle, where, the, primary, combatants, were, full, rigged, ships, armed, with, wrought, iron, guns, on, the, upper, decks, and, in, the, waists, foretelling, of, the, slow, decline, of, the, war, galley, the, sailing, vessel, was, always, at, the, mercy, of, the, wind, for, propulsion, and, those, that, did, carry, oars, were, placed, at, a, disadvantage, because, they, were, not, optimized, for, oar, use, the, galley, did, have, disadvantages, compared, to, the, sailing, vessel, though, their, smaller, hulls, were, not, able, to, hold, as, much, cargo, and, this, limited, their, range, as, the, crews, were, required, to, replenish, food, stuffs, more, frequently, the, low, freeboard, of, the, galley, meant, that, in, close, action, with, a, sailing, vessel, the, sailing, vessel, would, usually, maintain, a, height, advantage, the, sailing, vessel, could, also, fight, more, effectively, farther, out, at, sea, and, in, rougher, wind, conditions, because, of, the, height, of, their, freeboard, under, sail, an, oared, warship, was, placed, at, much, greater, risk, as, a, result, of, the, piercings, for, the, oars, which, were, required, to, be, near, the, waterline, and, would, allow, water, to, ingress, into, the, galley, if, the, vessel, heeled, too, far, to, one, side, these, advantages, and, disadvantages, led, the, galley, to, be, and, remain, a, primarily, coastal, vessel, the, shift, to, sailing, vessels, in, the, mediterranean, was, the, result, of, the, negation, of, some, of, the, galley, s, advantages, as, well, as, the, adoption, of, gunpowder, weapons, on, a, much, larger, institutional, scale, the, sailing, vessel, was, propelled, in, a, different, manner, than, the, galley, but, the, tactics, were, often, the, same, until, the, 16th, century, the, real, estate, afforded, to, the, sailing, vessel, to, place, larger, cannons, and, other, armament, mattered, little, because, early, gunpowder, weapons, had, limited, range, and, were, expensive, to, produce, the, eventual, creation, of, cast, iron, cannons, allowed, vessels, and, armies, to, be, outfitted, much, more, cheaply, the, cost, of, gunpowder, also, fell, in, this, period, the, armament, of, both, vessel, types, varied, between, larger, weapons, such, as, bombards, and, the, smaller, swivel, guns, for, logistical, purposes, it, became, convenient, for, those, with, larger, shore, establishments, to, standardize, upon, a, given, size, of, cannon, traditionally, the, english, in, the, north, and, the, venetians, in, the, mediterranean, are, seen, as, some, the, earliest, to, move, in, this, direction, the, improving, sail, rigs, of, northern, vessels, also, allowed, them, to, navigate, in, the, coastal, waters, of, the, mediterranean, to, a, much, larger, degree, than, before, aside, from, warships, the, decrease, in, the, cost, of, gunpowder, weapons, also, led, to, the, arming, of, merchants, the, larger, vessels, of, the, north, continued, to, mature, while, the, galley, retained, its, defining, characteristics, attempts, were, made, to, stave, this, off, such, as, the, addition, of, fighting, castles, in, the, bow, but, such, additions, to, counter, the, threats, brought, by, larger, sailing, vessels, often, offset, the, advantages, of, galley, from, around, 1450, three, major, naval, powers, established, a, dominance, over, different, parts, of, the, mediterranean, using, galleys, as, their, primary, weapons, at, sea, the, ottomans, in, the, east, venice, in, the, center, and, habsburg, spain, in, the, west, the, core, of, their, fleets, were, concentrated, in, the, three, major, wholly, dependable, naval, bases, in, the, mediterranean, constantinople, venice, and, barcelona, naval, warfare, in, the, 16th, century, mediterranean, was, fought, mostly, on, a, smaller, scale, with, raiding, and, minor, actions, dominating, only, three, truly, major, fleet, engagements, were, actually, fought, in, the, 16th, century, the, battles, of, preveza, in, 1538, djerba, in, 1560, and, lepanto, in, 1571, lepanto, became, the, last, large, all, galley, battle, ever, and, was, also, one, of, the, largest, battle, in, sheer, number, of, participants, in, early, modern, europe, before, the, napoleonic, wars, the, mediterranean, powers, also, employed, galley, forces, for, conflicts, outside, the, mediterranean, spain, sent, galley, squadrons, to, the, netherlands, during, the, later, stages, of, the, eighty, years, war, which, successfully, operated, against, dutch, forces, in, the, enclosed, shallow, coastal, waters, from, the, late, 1560s, galleys, were, also, used, to, transport, silver, to, genoese, bankers, to, finance, spanish, troops, against, the, dutch, uprising, galleasses, and, galleys, were, part, of, an, invasion, force, of, over, 16, 000, men, that, conquered, the, azores, in, 1583, around, 2, 000, galley, rowers, were, on, board, ships, of, the, famous, 1588, spanish, armada, though, few, of, these, actually, made, it, to, the, battle, itself, outside, european, and, middle, eastern, waters, spain, built, galleys, to, deal, with, pirates, and, privateers, in, both, the, caribbean, and, the, philippines, ottoman, galleys, contested, the, portuguese, intrusion, in, the, indian, ocean, in, the, 16th, century, but, failed, against, the, high, sided, massive, portuguese, carracks, in, open, waters, even, though, the, carracks, themselves, were, soon, surpassed, by, other, types, of, sailing, vessels, their, greater, range, great, size, and, high, superstructures, armed, with, numerous, wrought, iron, guns, easily, outmatched, the, short, ranged, low, freeboard, turkish, galleys, the, spanish, used, galleys, to, more, success, in, their, colonial, possessions, in, the, caribbean, and, the, philippines, to, hunt, pirates, and, sporadically, used, them, in, the, netherlands, and, the, bay, of, biscay, spain, maintained, four, permanent, galley, squadrons, to, guard, its, coasts, and, trade, routes, against, the, ottomans, the, french, and, their, corsairs, together, they, formed, the, largest, galley, navy, in, the, mediterranean, in, the, early, 17th, century, they, were, the, backbone, of, the, spanish, mediterranean, war, fleet, and, were, used, for, ferrying, troops, supplies, horses, and, munitions, to, spain, s, italian, and, african, possessions, in, southeast, asia, during, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, the, aceh, sultanate, had, fleets, of, up, to, 100, native, galley, like, vessels, ghali, as, well, as, smaller, rowed, vessels, there, were, described, by, europeans, as, lancarans, galliots, and, fustas, some, of, the, larger, vessels, were, very, large, with, heavier, armament, than, standard, mediterranean, galleys, with, raised, platforms, for, infantry, and, some, with, stern, structures, similar, in, height, to, that, of, contemporary, galleons, galleys, had, been, synonymous, with, warships, in, the, mediterranean, for, at, least, 2, 000, years, and, continued, to, fulfill, that, role, with, the, invention, of, gunpowder, and, heavy, artillery, though, early, 20th, century, historians, often, dismissed, the, galleys, as, hopelessly, outclassed, with, the, first, introduction, of, naval, artillery, on, sailing, ships, it, was, the, galley, that, was, favored, by, the, introduction, of, heavy, naval, guns, galleys, were, a, more, mature, technology, with, long, established, tactics, and, traditions, of, supporting, social, institutions, and, naval, organizations, in, combination, with, the, intensified, conflicts, this, led, to, a, substantial, increase, in, the, size, of, galley, fleets, from, c, 1520, 80, above, all, in, the, mediterranean, but, also, in, other, european, theatres, galleys, and, similar, oared, vessels, remained, uncontested, as, the, most, effective, gun, armed, warships, in, theory, until, the, 1560s, and, in, practice, for, a, few, decades, more, and, were, actually, considered, a, grave, risk, to, sailing, warships, they, could, effectively, fight, other, galleys, attack, sailing, ships, in, calm, weather, or, in, unfavorable, winds, or, deny, them, action, if, needed, and, act, as, floating, siege, batteries, they, were, also, unequaled, in, their, amphibious, capabilities, even, at, extended, ranges, as, exemplified, by, french, interventions, as, far, north, as, scotland, in, the, mid, 16th, century, heavy, artillery, on, galleys, was, mounted, in, the, bow, which, aligned, easily, with, the, long, standing, tactical, tradition, of, attacking, head, on, bow, first, the, ordnance, on, galleys, was, heavy, from, its, introduction, in, the, 1480s, and, capable, of, quickly, demolishing, the, high, thin, medieval, stone, walls, that, still, prevailed, in, the, 16th, century, this, temporarily, upended, the, strength, of, older, seaside, fortresses, which, had, to, be, rebuilt, to, cope, with, gunpowder, weapons, the, addition, of, guns, also, improved, the, amphibious, abilities, of, galleys, as, they, could, make, assaults, supported, with, heavy, firepower, and, were, even, more, effectively, defended, when, beached, stern, first, an, accumulation, and, generalizing, of, bronze, cannons, and, small, firearms, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, 16th, century, increased, the, cost, of, warfare, but, also, made, those, dependent, on, them, more, resilient, to, manpower, losses, older, ranged, weapons, like, bows, or, even, crossbows, required, considerable, skill, to, handle, sometimes, a, lifetime, of, practice, while, gunpowder, weapons, required, considerably, less, training, to, use, successfully, according, to, an, influential, study, by, military, historian, john, f, guilmartin, this, transition, in, warfare, along, with, the, introduction, of, much, cheaper, cast, iron, guns, in, the, 1580s, proved, the, death, knell, for, the, war, galley, as, a, significant, military, vessel, gunpowder, weapons, began, to, displace, men, as, the, fighting, power, of, armed, forces, making, individual, soldiers, more, deadly, and, effective, as, offensive, weapons, firearms, could, be, stored, for, years, with, minimal, maintenance, and, did, not, require, the, expenses, associated, with, soldiers, manpower, could, thus, be, exchanged, for, capital, investments, something, which, benefited, sailing, vessels, that, were, already, far, more, economical, in, their, use, of, manpower, it, also, served, to, increase, their, strategic, range, and, to, out, compete, galleys, as, fighting, ships, atlantic, style, warfare, based, on, large, heavily, armed, sailing, ships, began, to, change, naval, warfare, in, the, mediterranean, in, the, early, 17th, century, in, 1616, a, small, spanish, squadron, of, five, galleons, and, a, patache, cruised, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, defeated, an, ottoman, fleet, of, 55, galleys, at, the, battle, of, cape, celidonia, by, 1650, war, galleys, were, used, primarily, in, the, struggles, between, venice, and, the, ottoman, empire, for, strategic, island, and, coastal, trading, bases, and, until, the, 1720s, by, both, france, and, spain, for, largely, amphibious, and, cruising, operations, or, in, combination, with, heavy, sailing, ships, in, a, major, battle, where, they, played, specialized, roles, an, example, of, this, was, when, a, spanish, fleet, used, its, galleys, in, a, mixed, naval, amphibious, battle, in, the, second, 1641, battle, of, tarragona, to, break, a, french, naval, blockade, and, land, troops, and, supplies, even, the, venetians, ottomans, and, other, mediterranean, powers, began, to, build, atlantic, style, warships, for, use, in, the, mediterranean, in, the, latter, part, of, the, century, christian, and, muslim, corsairs, had, been, using, galleys, in, sea, roving, and, in, support, of, the, major, powers, in, times, of, war, but, largely, replaced, them, with, xebecs, various, sail, oar, hybrids, and, a, few, remaining, light, galleys, in, the, early, 17th, century, no, large, all, galley, battles, were, fought, after, the, gigantic, clash, at, lepanto, in, 1571, and, galleys, were, mostly, used, as, cruisers, or, for, supporting, sailing, warships, as, a, rearguard, in, fleet, actions, similar, to, the, duties, performed, by, frigates, outside, the, mediterranean, they, could, assist, damaged, ships, out, of, the, line, but, generally, only, in, very, calm, weather, as, was, the, case, at, the, battle, of, m, laga, in, 1704, they, could, also, defeat, larger, ships, that, were, isolated, as, when, in, 1651, a, squadron, of, spanish, galleys, captured, a, french, galleon, at, formentera, for, small, states, and, principalities, as, well, as, groups, of, private, merchants, galleys, were, more, affordable, than, large, and, complex, sailing, warships, and, were, used, as, defense, against, piracy, galleys, required, less, timber, to, build, the, design, was, relatively, simple, and, they, carried, fewer, guns, they, were, tactically, flexible, and, could, be, used, for, naval, ambushes, as, well, amphibious, operations, they, also, required, few, skilled, seamen, and, were, difficult, for, sailing, ships, to, catch, but, vital, in, hunting, down, and, catching, other, galleys, and, oared, raiders, among, the, largest, galley, fleets, in, the, 17th, century, were, operated, by, the, two, major, mediterranean, powers, france, and, spain, france, had, by, the, 1650s, become, the, most, powerful, state, in, europe, and, expanded, its, galley, forces, under, the, rule, of, the, absolutist, sun, king, louis, xiv, in, the, 1690s, the, french, galley, corps, corps, des, gal, res, reached, its, all, time, peak, with, more, than, 50, vessels, manned, by, over, 15, 000, men, and, officers, becoming, the, largest, galley, fleet, in, the, world, at, the, time, although, there, was, intense, rivalry, between, france, and, spain, not, a, single, galley, battle, occurred, between, the, two, great, powers, during, this, period, and, virtually, no, naval, battles, between, other, nations, either, during, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, french, galleys, were, involved, in, actions, against, antwerp, and, harwich, but, due, to, the, intricacies, of, alliance, politics, there, were, never, any, franco, spanish, galley, clashes, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, other, major, naval, powers, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, order, of, saint, john, based, in, malta, and, of, the, papal, states, in, central, italy, cut, down, drastically, on, their, galley, forces, despite, the, lack, of, action, the, galley, corps, received, vast, resources, 25, 50, of, the, french, naval, expenditures, during, the, 1660s, it, was, maintained, as, a, functional, fighting, force, right, up, until, its, abolition, in, 1748, though, its, primary, function, was, more, of, a, symbol, of, louis, xiv, s, absolutist, ambitions, the, last, recorded, battle, in, the, mediterranean, where, galleys, played, a, significant, part, was, at, matapan, in, 1717, between, the, ottomans, and, venice, and, its, allies, though, they, had, little, influence, on, the, outcome, few, large, scale, naval, battles, were, fought, in, the, mediterranean, throughout, most, of, the, remainder, of, the, 18th, century, the, tuscan, galley, fleet, was, dismantled, around, 1718, naples, had, only, four, old, vessels, by, 1734, and, the, french, galley, corps, had, ceased, to, exist, as, an, independent, arm, in, 1748, venice, the, papal, states, and, the, knights, of, malta, were, the, only, state, fleets, that, maintained, galleys, though, in, nothing, like, their, previous, quantities, by, 1790, there, were, fewer, than, 50, galleys, in, service, among, all, the, mediterranean, powers, half, of, which, belonged, to, venice, oared, vessels, remained, in, use, in, northern, waters, for, a, long, time, though, in, subordinate, role, and, in, particular, circumstances, in, the, italian, wars, french, galleys, brought, up, from, the, mediterranean, to, the, atlantic, posed, a, serious, threat, to, the, early, english, tudor, navy, during, coastal, operations, the, response, came, in, the, building, of, a, considerable, fleet, of, oared, vessels, including, hybrids, with, a, complete, three, masted, rig, as, well, as, a, mediterranean, style, galleys, that, were, even, attempted, to, be, manned, with, convicts, and, slaves, under, king, henry, viii, the, english, navy, used, several, kinds, of, vessels, that, were, adapted, to, local, needs, english, galliasses, very, different, from, the, mediterranean, vessel, of, the, same, name, were, employed, to, cover, the, flanks, of, larger, naval, forces, while, pinnaces, and, rowbarges, were, used, for, scouting, or, even, as, a, backup, for, the, longboats, and, tenders, for, the, larger, sailing, ships, during, the, dutch, revolt, 1566, 1609, both, the, dutch, and, spanish, found, galleys, useful, for, amphibious, operations, in, the, many, shallow, waters, around, the, low, countries, where, deep, draft, sailing, vessels, could, not, enter, while, galleys, were, too, vulnerable, to, be, used, in, large, numbers, in, the, open, waters, of, the, atlantic, they, were, well, suited, for, use, in, much, of, the, baltic, sea, by, denmark, norway, sweden, russia, and, some, of, the, central, european, powers, with, ports, on, the, southern, coast, there, were, two, types, of, naval, battlegrounds, in, the, baltic, one, was, the, open, sea, suitable, for, large, sailing, fleets, the, other, was, the, coastal, areas, and, especially, the, chain, of, small, islands, and, archipelagos, that, ran, almost, uninterrupted, from, stockholm, to, the, gulf, of, finland, in, these, areas, conditions, were, often, too, calm, cramped, and, shallow, for, sailing, ships, but, they, were, excellent, for, galleys, and, other, oared, vessels, galleys, of, the, mediterranean, type, were, first, introduced, in, the, baltic, sea, around, the, mid, 16th, century, as, competition, between, the, scandinavian, states, of, denmark, and, sweden, intensified, the, swedish, galley, fleet, was, the, largest, outside, the, mediterranean, and, served, as, an, auxiliary, branch, of, the, army, very, little, is, known, about, the, design, of, baltic, sea, galleys, except, that, they, were, overall, smaller, than, in, the, mediterranean, and, they, were, rowed, by, army, soldiers, rather, than, convicts, or, slaves, galleys, were, introduced, to, the, baltic, sea, in, the, 16th, century, but, the, details, of, their, designs, are, lacking, due, to, the, absence, of, records, they, might, have, been, built, in, a, more, regional, style, but, the, only, known, depiction, from, the, time, shows, a, typical, mediterranean, style, vessel, there, is, conclusive, evidence, that, denmark, norway, became, the, first, baltic, power, to, build, classic, mediterranean, style, galleys, in, the, 1660s, though, they, proved, to, be, generally, too, large, to, be, useful, in, the, shallow, waters, of, the, baltic, archipelagos, sweden, and, especially, russia, began, to, launch, galleys, and, various, rowed, vessels, in, great, numbers, during, the, great, northern, war, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 18th, century, sweden, was, late, in, the, game, when, it, came, to, building, an, effective, oared, fighting, fleet, sk, rg, rdsflottan, the, archipelago, fleet, officially, arm, ns, flotta, the, fleet, of, the, army, while, the, russian, galley, forces, under, tsar, peter, i, developed, into, a, supporting, arm, for, the, sailing, navy, and, a, well, functioning, auxiliary, of, the, army, which, infiltrated, and, conducted, numerous, raids, on, the, eastern, swedish, coast, in, the, 1710s, sweden, and, russia, became, the, two, main, competitors, for, baltic, dominance, in, the, 18th, century, and, built, the, largest, galley, fleets, in, the, world, at, the, time, they, were, used, for, amphibious, operations, in, russo, swedish, wars, of, 1741, 43, and, 1788, 90, the, last, galleys, ever, constructed, were, built, in, 1796, by, russia, and, remained, in, service, well, into, the, 19th, century, but, saw, little, action, the, last, time, galleys, were, deployed, in, action, was, when, the, russian, navy, was, attacked, in, bo, turku, in, 1854, as, part, of, the, crimean, war, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, role, of, baltic, galleys, in, coastal, fleets, was, replaced, first, with, hybrid, archipelago, frigates, such, as, the, turuma, or, pojama, and, xebecs, and, after, the, 1790s, with, various, types, of, gunboats, the, documentary, evidence, for, the, construction, of, ancient, galleys, is, fragmentary, particularly, in, pre, roman, times, plans, and, schematics, in, the, modern, sense, did, not, exist, until, around, the, 17th, century, and, nothing, comparable, has, survived, from, ancient, times, how, galleys, were, constructed, has, therefore, been, a, matter, of, looking, at, circumstantial, evidence, in, literature, art, coinage, and, monuments, that, include, ships, some, of, them, actually, in, natural, size, since, the, war, galleys, floated, even, with, a, ruptured, hull, and, virtually, never, had, any, ballast, or, heavy, cargo, that, could, sink, them, almost, no, wrecks, have, so, far, been, found, on, the, funerary, monument, of, the, egyptian, king, sahure, 2487, 2475, bc, in, abusir, there, are, relief, images, of, vessels, with, a, marked, sheer, the, upward, curvature, at, each, end, of, the, hull, and, seven, pairs, of, oars, along, its, side, a, number, that, was, likely, to, have, been, symbolical, rather, than, a, realistic, depiction, and, steering, oars, in, the, stern, these, vessels, have, only, one, mast, and, vertical, stems, and, sternposts, with, the, front, decorated, with, an, eye, of, horus, the, first, example, of, such, a, decoration, the, eye, was, later, used, by, other, mediterranean, cultures, to, decorate, seagoing, craft, in, the, belief, that, it, helped, to, guide, the, ship, safely, to, its, destination, the, early, egyptian, vessels, apparently, lacked, a, keel, to, provide, a, stiffening, along, its, length, they, had, large, cables, trusses, connecting, stem, and, stern, resting, on, massive, crutches, on, deck, they, were, held, in, tension, to, avoid, hogging, while, at, sea, bending, the, ship, s, construction, upward, in, the, middle, in, the, 15th, century, bc, egyptian, galley, like, craft, were, still, depicted, with, the, distinctive, extreme, sheer, but, had, by, then, developed, the, distinctive, forward, curving, stern, decorations, with, ornaments, in, the, shape, of, lotus, flowers, they, had, possibly, developed, a, primitive, type, of, keel, but, still, retained, the, large, cables, intended, to, prevent, hogging, the, construction, of, the, earliest, oared, vessels, is, mostly, unknown, and, highly, conjectural, they, likely, used, a, mortise, construction, but, were, sewn, together, rather, than, pinned, together, with, nails, and, dowels, being, completely, open, they, were, rowed, or, even, paddled, from, the, open, deck, and, likely, had, ram, entries, projections, from, the, bow, lowered, the, resistance, of, moving, through, water, making, them, slightly, more, hydrodynamic, the, first, true, galleys, the, triaconters, literally, thirty, oarers, and, penteconters, fifty, oarers, were, developed, from, these, early, designs, and, set, the, standard, for, the, larger, designs, that, would, come, later, they, were, rowed, on, only, one, level, which, made, them, fairly, slow, likely, only, about, 10, km, h, 6, mph, by, the, 8th, century, bc, the, first, galleys, rowed, at, two, levels, had, been, developed, among, the, earliest, being, the, two, level, penteconters, which, were, considerably, shorter, than, the, one, level, equivalents, and, therefore, more, maneuverable, they, were, an, estimated, 25, m, in, length, and, displaced, 15, tonnes, with, 25, pairs, of, oars, these, could, have, reached, an, estimated, top, speed, of, up, to, 14, km, h, 9, mph, making, them, the, first, genuine, warships, when, fitted, with, bow, rams, they, were, equipped, with, a, single, square, sail, on, mast, set, roughly, halfway, along, the, length, of, the, hull, by, the, 5th, century, bc, the, first, triremes, were, in, use, by, various, powers, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, this, was, a, fully, developed, highly, specialized, war, galley, that, was, capable, of, high, speeds, and, complex, maneuvers, at, nearly, 40, m, in, length, displacing, up, to, 50, tonnes, it, was, more, than, three, times, as, expensive, to, build, as, a, two, level, penteconter, a, trireme, also, had, an, additional, mast, with, a, smaller, square, sail, placed, near, the, bow, up, to, 170, oarsmen, sat, on, three, levels, with, one, oar, each, that, varied, slightly, in, length, to, accommodate, three, levels, of, oars, rowers, sat, staggered, on, three, levels, arrangements, of, the, three, levels, are, believed, to, have, varied, but, the, most, well, documented, design, made, use, of, a, projecting, structure, or, outrigger, where, the, oarlock, in, the, form, of, a, thole, pin, was, placed, this, allowed, the, outermost, row, of, oarsmen, enough, leverage, for, full, strokes, that, made, efficient, use, of, their, oars, the, first, dedicated, war, galleys, fitted, with, rams, were, built, with, a, mortise, and, tenon, technique, a, so, called, shell, first, method, in, this, the, planking, of, the, hull, was, strong, enough, to, hold, the, ship, together, structurally, and, was, also, watertight, without, the, need, for, caulking, hulls, had, sharp, bottoms, without, keelsons, in, order, to, support, the, structure, and, were, reinforced, by, transverse, framing, secured, with, dowels, with, nails, driven, through, them, to, prevent, the, hull, from, hogging, there, was, a, hypozoma, underbelt, a, thick, doubled, rope, that, connected, bow, with, stern, it, was, kept, taut, to, add, strength, to, the, construction, along, its, length, but, its, exact, design, or, the, method, of, tightening, is, not, known, the, ram, the, primary, weapon, of, ancient, galleys, from, around, the, 8th, to, the, 4th, century, was, not, attached, directly, on, the, hull, but, to, a, structure, extending, from, it, this, way, the, ram, could, twist, off, if, got, stuck, after, ramming, rather, than, breaking, the, integrity, of, the, hull, the, ram, fitting, consisted, of, a, massive, projecting, timber, and, the, ram, itself, was, a, thick, bronze, casting, with, horizontal, blades, that, could, weigh, from, 400, kg, up, to, 2, tonnes, galleys, from, 4th, century, bc, up, to, the, time, of, the, early, roman, empire, in, the, 1st, century, ad, became, successively, larger, three, levels, of, oars, was, the, practical, upper, limit, but, it, was, improved, on, by, making, ships, longer, broader, and, heavier, and, placing, more, than, one, rower, per, oar, naval, conflict, grew, more, intense, and, extensive, and, by, 100, bc, galleys, with, four, five, or, six, rows, of, oarsmen, were, commonplace, and, carried, large, complements, of, soldiers, and, catapults, with, high, freeboard, up, to, 3, m, and, additional, tower, structures, from, which, missiles, could, be, shot, down, onto, enemy, decks, they, were, intended, to, be, like, floating, fortresses, designs, with, everything, from, eight, rows, of, oarsmen, and, upward, were, built, but, most, of, them, are, believed, to, have, been, impractical, show, pieces, never, used, in, actual, warfare, ptolemy, iv, the, greek, pharaoh, of, egypt, 221, 205, bc, is, recorded, as, building, a, gigantic, ship, with, forty, rows, of, oarsmen, though, no, specification, of, its, design, remains, one, suggested, design, was, that, of, a, huge, trireme, catamaran, with, up, to, 14, men, per, oar, and, it, is, assumed, that, it, was, intended, as, a, showpiece, rather, than, a, practical, warship, with, the, consolidation, of, roman, imperial, power, the, size, of, both, fleets, and, galleys, decreased, considerably, the, huge, polyremes, disappeared, and, the, fleet, were, equipped, primarily, with, triremes, and, liburnians, compact, biremes, with, 25, pairs, of, oars, that, were, well, suited, for, patrol, duty, and, chasing, down, raiders, and, pirates, in, the, northern, provinces, oared, patrol, boats, were, employed, to, keep, local, tribes, in, check, along, the, shores, of, rivers, like, the, rhine, and, the, danube, as, the, need, for, large, warships, disappeared, the, design, of, the, trireme, the, pinnacle, of, ancient, war, ship, design, fell, into, obscurity, and, was, eventually, forgotten, the, last, known, reference, to, triremes, in, battle, is, dated, to, 324, at, the, battle, of, the, hellespont, in, the, late, 5th, century, the, byzantine, historian, zosimus, declared, the, knowledge, of, how, to, build, them, to, have, been, long, since, forgotten, the, primary, warship, of, the, byzantine, navy, until, the, 12th, century, was, the, dromon, and, other, similar, ship, types, considered, an, evolution, of, the, roman, liburnian, the, term, first, appeared, in, the, late, 5th, century, and, was, commonly, used, for, a, specific, kind, of, war, galley, by, the, 6th, century, the, term, drom, n, literally, runner, itself, comes, from, the, greek, root, drom, to, run, and, 6th, century, authors, like, procopius, are, explicit, in, their, references, to, the, speed, of, these, vessels, during, the, next, few, centuries, as, the, naval, struggle, with, the, arabs, intensified, heavier, versions, with, two, or, possibly, even, three, banks, of, oars, evolved, the, accepted, view, is, that, the, main, developments, which, differentiated, the, early, dromons, from, the, liburnians, and, that, henceforth, characterized, mediterranean, galleys, were, the, adoption, of, a, full, deck, the, abandonment, of, rams, on, the, bow, in, favor, of, an, above, water, spur, and, the, gradual, introduction, of, lateen, sails, the, exact, reasons, for, the, abandonment, of, the, ram, are, unclear, depictions, of, upward, pointing, beaks, in, the, 4th, century, vatican, vergil, manuscript, may, well, illustrate, that, the, ram, had, already, been, replaced, by, a, spur, in, late, roman, galleys, one, possibility, is, that, the, change, occurred, because, of, the, gradual, evolution, of, the, ancient, shell, first, construction, method, against, which, rams, had, been, designed, into, the, skeleton, first, method, which, produced, a, stronger, and, more, flexible, hull, less, susceptible, to, ram, attacks, at, least, by, the, early, 7th, century, the, ram, s, original, function, had, been, forgotten, the, dromons, that, procopius, described, were, single, banked, ships, of, probably, 25, oars, per, side, unlike, ancient, vessels, which, used, an, outrigger, these, extended, directly, from, the, hull, in, the, later, bireme, dromons, of, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, two, oar, banks, were, divided, by, the, deck, with, the, first, oar, bank, was, situated, below, whilst, the, second, oar, bank, was, situated, above, deck, these, rowers, were, expected, to, fight, alongside, the, marines, in, boarding, operations, the, overall, length, of, these, ships, was, probably, about, 32, meters, the, stern, prymn, had, a, tent, that, covered, the, captain, s, berth, the, prow, featured, an, elevated, forecastle, that, acted, as, a, fighting, platform, and, could, house, one, or, more, siphons, for, the, discharge, of, greek, fire, and, on, the, largest, dromons, there, were, wooden, castles, on, either, side, between, the, masts, providing, archers, with, elevated, firing, platforms, the, bow, spur, was, intended, to, ride, over, an, enemy, ship, s, oars, breaking, them, and, rendering, it, helpless, against, missile, fire, and, boarding, actions, from, the, 12th, century, the, design, of, war, galleys, evolved, into, the, form, that, would, remain, largely, the, same, until, the, building, of, the, last, war, galleys, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, length, to, breadth, ratio, was, a, minimum, of, 8, 1, a, rectangular, telaro, a, projecting, outrigger, was, added, to, support, the, oars, and, the, rowers, benches, were, laid, out, in, a, diagonal, herringbone, pattern, angled, aft, with, a, central, gangway, corsia, running, along, the, centerline, the, angling, of, the, benches, allowed, the, rowers, to, handle, individual, oars, without, interfering, with, each, other, s, movements, it, was, based, on, the, form, of, the, galea, the, smaller, byzantine, galleys, and, would, be, known, mostly, by, the, italian, term, galea, sottile, literally, slender, galley, a, second, smaller, mast, was, added, sometime, in, the, 13th, century, and, the, number, of, rowers, rose, from, two, to, three, rowers, per, bench, as, a, standard, from, the, late, 13th, to, the, early, 14th, century, the, galee, sottili, would, make, up, the, bulk, the, main, war, fleets, of, every, major, naval, power, in, the, mediterranean, assisted, by, the, smaller, single, masted, galiotte, as, well, as, the, christian, and, muslim, corsairs, fleets, ottoman, galleys, were, very, similar, in, design, though, in, general, smaller, faster, under, sail, but, slower, under, oars, the, standard, size, of, the, galley, remained, stable, from, the, 14th, until, the, early, 16th, century, when, the, introduction, of, naval, artillery, began, to, have, effects, on, design, and, tactics, the, traditional, two, side, rudders, were, complemented, with, a, stern, rudder, sometime, after, c, 1400, and, eventually, the, side, rudders, disappeared, altogether, it, was, also, during, the, 15th, century, that, large, artillery, pieces, were, first, mounted, on, galleys, burgundian, records, from, the, mid, 15th, century, describe, galleys, with, some, form, of, guns, but, do, not, specify, the, size, the, first, conclusive, evidence, of, a, large, cannon, mounted, on, a, galley, comes, from, a, woodcut, of, a, venetian, galley, in, 1486, the, first, guns, were, fixed, directly, on, timbers, in, the, bow, and, aimed, directly, forward, a, placement, that, would, remain, largely, unchanged, until, the, galley, disappeared, from, active, service, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, introduction, of, guns, in, the, bows, of, galleys, a, permanent, wooden, structure, called, rambade, french, rambade, italian, rambata, spanish, arrumbada, was, introduced, the, rambade, became, standard, on, virtually, all, galleys, in, the, early, 16th, century, there, were, some, variations, in, the, navies, of, different, mediterranean, powers, but, the, overall, layout, was, the, same, the, forward, aiming, battery, was, covered, by, a, wooden, platform, which, gave, gunners, a, minimum, of, protection, and, functioned, as, both, a, staging, area, for, boarding, attacks, and, as, a, firing, platform, for, on, board, soldiers, after, its, introduction, the, rambade, became, a, standard, detail, on, every, fighting, galley, until, the, very, end, of, galley, era, in, the, early, 19th, century, by, the, mid, 17th, century, galleys, reached, what, has, been, described, as, their, final, form, galleys, had, looked, more, or, less, the, same, for, over, four, centuries, and, a, fairly, standardized, classification, system, had, been, developed, by, the, mediterranean, bureaucracies, based, primarily, on, the, number, of, benches, in, a, vessel, a, mediterranean, galley, would, have, 25, pairs, of, oars, and, total, of, about, 500, men, command, galleys, lanternas, lantern, galleys, were, even, larger, with, 30, pairs, of, oars, and, up, to, seven, rowers, per, oar, armament, consisted, of, one, heavy, 24, or, 36, pounder, and, two, to, four, 4, to, 12, pounders, in, the, bow, rows, of, light, swivel, guns, were, often, placed, along, the, entire, length, of, the, galley, on, the, railings, for, close, quarter, defense, the, length, to, width, ratio, of, the, ships, was, about, 8, 1, with, two, masts, carrying, one, large, lateen, sail, each, in, the, baltic, galleys, were, generally, shorter, with, a, length, to, width, ratio, from, 5, 1, to, 7, 1, an, adaptation, to, the, cramped, conditions, of, the, baltic, archipelagos, a, single, mainmast, was, standard, on, most, war, galleys, until, c, 1600, a, second, shorter, mast, could, be, raised, temporarily, in, the, bows, but, became, permanent, by, the, early, 17th, century, it, was, stepped, slightly, to, the, side, to, allow, for, the, recoil, of, the, heavy, guns, the, other, was, placed, roughly, in, the, center, of, the, ship, a, third, smaller, mast, further, astern, akin, to, a, mizzen, mast, was, also, introduced, on, large, galleys, possibly, in, the, early, 17th, century, but, was, standard, at, least, by, the, early, 18th, century, galleys, had, little, room, for, provisions, and, depended, on, frequent, resupplying, and, were, often, beached, at, night, to, rest, the, crew, and, cook, meals, where, cooking, areas, were, actually, present, they, consisted, of, a, clay, lined, box, with, a, hearth, or, similar, cooking, equipment, fitted, on, the, vessel, in, place, of, a, rowing, bench, usually, on, the, port, left, side, ancient, rowing, was, done, in, a, fixed, seated, position, with, rowers, facing, the, stern, the, most, efficient, rowing, position, a, sliding, stroke, which, provided, the, strength, from, both, legs, as, well, as, the, arms, was, suggested, by, earlier, historians, but, no, conclusive, evidence, has, supported, it, practical, experiments, with, the, full, scale, trireme, reconstruction, olympias, has, shown, that, there, was, insufficient, space, to, perform, a, sliding, stroke, movement, and, moving, or, rolling, seats, would, have, been, highly, impractical, to, construct, with, ancient, technology, rowers, in, ancient, war, galleys, sat, below, the, upper, deck, with, little, view, of, their, surroundings, the, rowing, was, therefore, managed, by, supervisors, and, coordinated, with, pipes, or, rhythmic, chanting, galleys, were, highly, maneuverable, able, to, turn, on, their, axis, or, even, to, row, backward, though, such, maneuvers, required, a, skilled, and, experienced, crew, in, galleys, with, an, arrangement, of, three, men, per, oar, as, in, the, larger, polyremes, all, would, be, seated, but, the, rower, furthest, inboard, would, perform, a, stand, and, sit, stroke, getting, up, on, his, feet, to, push, the, oar, forward, and, then, sitting, down, again, to, pull, it, back, the, faster, a, vessel, travels, the, more, energy, it, uses, reaching, high, speeds, requires, energy, which, a, human, powered, vessel, is, incapable, of, producing, oar, systems, generate, very, low, amounts, of, energy, for, propulsion, only, about, 70, w, per, rower, and, the, upper, limit, for, rowing, in, a, fixed, position, is, around, 18, km, h, 11, mph, ancient, war, galleys, of, the, kind, used, in, classical, greece, are, by, modern, historians, considered, to, be, the, most, energy, efficient, and, fastest, of, galley, designs, throughout, history, a, full, scale, replica, of, a, 5th, century, bc, trireme, the, olympias, was, built, 1985, 87, and, was, put, through, a, series, of, trials, to, test, its, performance, they, proved, that, a, cruising, speed, of, about, 14, km, h, 9, mph, could, be, maintained, for, an, entire, day, of, travel, sprinting, speeds, of, up, to, 18, km, h, 11, mph, were, possible, but, only, for, a, few, minutes, and, would, tire, the, crew, quickly, ancient, galleys, were, lightly, built, and, the, original, triremes, are, presumed, never, to, have, been, surpassed, in, speed, medieval, galleys, are, believed, to, have, been, considerably, slower, especially, since, they, were, not, designed, for, ramming, a, cruising, speed, of, no, more, than, 5, km, h, 3, mph, has, been, estimated, a, sprint, speed, of, up, to, 13, km, h, 8, mph, was, possible, for, 20, 30, minutes, but, risked, exhausting, the, rowers, completely, rowing, in, headwinds, or, even, moderately, rough, weather, was, difficult, as, well, as, exhausting, in, high, seas, ancient, galleys, would, set, sail, to, run, before, the, wind, they, were, highly, susceptible, to, high, waves, and, could, become, unmanageable, if, the, projecting, rowing, frame, apostis, became, overwhelmed, by, the, waves, ancient, and, medieval, galleys, are, assumed, to, have, sailed, only, with, the, wind, more, or, less, from, behind, for, a, top, speed, of, about, 15, km, h, 9, mph, in, fair, conditions, in, ancient, galleys, under, sail, most, of, the, motive, power, came, from, a, single, square, sail, it, was, rigged, on, a, mast, somewhat, forward, of, the, center, of, the, ship, with, a, smaller, mast, carrying, a, head, sail, in, the, bow, triangular, lateen, sails, are, attested, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, gradually, became, the, sail, of, choice, for, galleys, by, the, 9th, century, lateens, were, firmly, established, as, part, of, the, standard, galley, rig, the, lateen, rig, required, a, larger, crew, to, handle, than, a, square, sail, rig, but, this, was, not, a, problem, in, the, heavily, manned, galleys, the, byzantine, general, belisarius, s, invasion, fleet, of, 533, was, at, least, partly, equipped, with, lateen, sails, making, it, probable, that, by, the, time, the, lateen, had, become, the, standard, rig, for, the, dromon, with, the, traditional, square, sail, gradually, falling, out, of, use, in, medieval, seafaring, in, the, mediterranean, unlike, a, square, sail, rig, the, spar, of, a, lateen, sail, did, not, pivot, around, the, mast, to, change, tacks, the, entire, spar, had, to, be, raised, vertically, and, passed, to, the, other, side, of, the, mast, since, a, lateen, spar, was, longer, than, the, mast, itself, and, not, much, shorter, than, the, ship, itself, this, was, more, complex, and, potentially, dangerous, compared, to, tacking, with, a, square, rig, contrary, to, the, popular, image, of, rowers, chained, to, the, oars, conveyed, by, movies, such, as, ben, hur, there, is, no, evidence, that, ancient, navies, made, regular, use, of, condemned, criminals, or, slaves, as, oarsmen, with, the, possible, exception, of, ptolemaic, egypt, literary, evidence, indicates, that, both, greek, and, roman, navies, relied, on, paid, labor, or, ordinary, soldiers, to, man, their, galleys, slaves, were, put, at, the, oars, only, in, times, of, crisis, in, some, cases, these, people, would, be, given, freedom, after, the, crisis, was, averted, roman, merchant, vessels, usually, sailing, vessels, were, manned, by, slaves, sometimes, even, with, slaves, as, ship, s, master, but, this, was, seldom, the, case, in, merchant, galleys, it, was, only, in, the, early, 16th, century, that, galley, slaves, became, commonplace, both, galley, fleets, and, the, size, of, individual, vessels, increased, in, size, during, the, early, modern, period, which, required, more, rowers, the, number, of, benches, could, not, be, increased, without, lengthening, hulls, beyond, their, structural, limits, and, more, than, three, oars, per, bench, was, not, practicable, the, demand, for, more, rowers, also, meant, that, the, relatively, limited, number, of, skilled, oarsmen, could, not, keep, up, with, the, demand, of, the, larger, fleets, it, became, increasingly, common, to, man, galleys, with, convicts, or, slaves, which, required, a, simpler, method, of, rowing, the, older, method, of, employing, professional, rowers, using, the, alla, sensile, method, one, oar, per, rower, with, two, to, three, rower, sharing, the, same, bench, was, gradually, phased, out, in, favor, of, a, scaloccio, which, required, less, skill, a, single, large, oar, was, used, for, each, bench, with, several, rowers, working, the, oar, together, the, number, of, oarsmen, per, oar, rose, from, three, up, to, five, and, in, some, of, the, largest, command, galleys, there, could, be, as, many, as, seven, to, an, oar, all, major, mediterranean, powers, sentenced, criminals, to, galley, service, but, initially, only, in, time, of, war, christian, naval, powers, such, as, spain, frequently, employed, muslim, captives, and, prisoners, of, war, the, ottoman, navy, and, its, north, african, corsair, allies, put, christian, prisoners, to, the, oars, in, large, numbers, but, also, mixed, with, volunteers, habsburg, spain, relied, mostly, on, servile, rowers, in, great, part, because, its, organizational, structure, was, geared, toward, employing, slaves, and, convicts, venice, was, one, of, few, major, mediterranean, powers, that, used, almost, only, free, rowers, a, result, of, their, reliance, on, alla, sensile, rowing, which, required, skilled, professional, rowers, the, knights, of, saint, john, used, slaves, extensively, as, did, the, papal, states, florence, and, genoa, the, north, african, ghazi, corsairs, relied, almost, entirely, on, christian, slaves, as, rowers, in, the, earliest, times, of, naval, warfare, boarding, was, the, only, means, of, deciding, a, naval, engagement, but, little, to, nothing, is, known, about, the, tactics, involved, in, the, first, recorded, naval, battle, the, battle, of, the, delta, the, battle, was, fought, in, close, combat, melee, with, the, support, of, archers, some, perched, on, raised, platforms, the, egyptian, victory, was, commemorated, on, the, mortuary, temple, of, ramesses, iii, at, medinet, habu, and, shows, intense, close, quarters, fighting, and, the, use, of, grapnels, thrown, into, the, rigging, to, capsize, ships, and, throwing, its, crew, into, the, sea, around, the, 8th, century, bc, ramming, began, to, be, employed, as, war, galleys, were, equipped, with, heavy, bronze, rams, records, of, the, persian, wars, in, the, early, 5th, century, bc, by, the, ancient, historian, herodotus, c, 484, 25, bc, show, that, by, this, time, ramming, tactics, had, evolved, among, the, greeks, ramming, itself, was, done, by, smashing, into, the, rear, or, side, of, an, enemy, ship, punching, a, hole, in, the, planking, this, would, not, actually, sink, an, ancient, galley, unless, it, was, heavily, laden, with, cargo, and, stores, with, a, normal, load, it, was, buoyant, enough, to, float, even, with, a, breached, hull, breaking, the, enemy, s, oars, was, another, way, of, rendering, ships, immobile, rendering, them, easier, targets, if, ramming, was, not, possible, or, successful, the, on, board, complement, of, soldiers, would, attempt, to, board, and, capture, the, enemy, vessel, by, securing, it, with, grappling, irons, accompanied, by, missile, fire, with, arrows, or, javelins, trying, to, set, the, enemy, ship, on, fire, by, hurling, incendiary, missiles, or, by, pouring, the, content, of, fire, pots, attached, to, long, handles, is, thought, to, have, been, used, especially, since, smoke, below, decks, would, easily, disable, rowers, ramming, tactics, were, gradually, superseded, in, the, last, centuries, bc, by, the, macedonians, and, romans, both, primarily, land, based, powers, hand, to, hand, fighting, with, large, complements, of, heavy, infantry, supported, by, ship, borne, catapults, dominated, the, fighting, style, during, the, roman, era, thought, this, decreased, mobility, of, vessels, it, meant, that, less, skill, was, required, from, individual, oarsmen, fleets, thereby, became, less, dependent, on, highly, skilled, rowers, with, a, lifetime, of, experience, at, the, oar, by, the, first, centuries, ad, ramming, tactics, had, completely, disappeared, along, with, the, knowledge, of, the, design, of, the, ancient, trireme, medieval, galleys, instead, developed, a, projection, or, spur, in, the, bow, that, was, designed, to, break, oars, and, act, as, a, boarding, platform, for, taking, enemy, ships, the, only, remaining, examples, of, ramming, tactics, were, occasional, attempts, to, collide, with, enemy, ships, in, order, to, destabilize, or, capsize, them, the, byzantine, navy, the, largest, mediterranean, war, fleet, throughout, most, of, the, early, middle, ages, employed, crescent, formations, in, order, to, turn, the, enemy, s, flanks, as, did, the, arab, fleets, that, fought, them, from, the, 7th, century, onward, the, initial, stages, in, naval, battles, was, an, exchanges, of, missiles, ranging, from, combustible, projectiles, to, arrows, caltrops, and, javelins, the, aim, was, not, to, sink, ships, but, to, deplete, the, ranks, of, enemy, crews, before, boarding, which, decided, the, outcome, byzantine, dromons, had, pavesades, racks, of, large, shields, along, the, railings, which, provided, protection, to, the, deck, crew, larger, ships, also, had, wooden, castles, between, the, masts, on, either, side, of, the, upper, decks, which, allowed, archers, to, shoot, from, an, elevated, firing, position, later, medieval, navies, continued, to, use, similar, tactics, with, a, line, abreast, formation, as, standard, as, galleys, were, intended, to, be, fought, from, the, bow, they, were, at, their, weakest, along, the, sides, especially, in, the, middle, the, crescent, formation, employed, by, the, byzantines, continued, to, be, used, throughout, the, middle, ages, the, ships, on, the, edges, of, the, crescent, would, attempt, to, crash, their, bows, straight, into, the, sides, of, the, enemy, ships, at, the, edge, of, the, formation, in, large, scale, galley, to, galley, engagements, tactics, remained, essentially, the, same, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, even, with, the, introduction, of, heavy, guns, since, galleys, could, close, the, reliable, maximum, range, of, early, naval, guns, faster, than, the, guns, could, be, reloaded, gun, crews, would, hold, their, fire, until, the, last, possible, moment, shortly, before, impact, all, available, guns, would, fire, similar, to, infantry, tactics, in, the, era, of, short, range, inaccurate, firearms, in, extreme, cases, such, last, second, discharges, could, kill, dozens, of, men, instantly, dealing, a, severe, shock, to, the, enemy, unless, one, side, could, outmaneuver, the, other, lines, of, galleys, would, crash, into, each, other, head, on, individual, ships, would, then, be, locked, bow, to, bow, in, close, formation, and, each, ship, would, be, fought, over, in, close, quarters, combat, as, long, as, a, vessel, was, not, completely, overrun, reinforcements, could, be, fed, into, the, fight, from, reserve, vessels, in, the, rear, the, earliest, guns, were, of, large, calibers, initially, of, wrought, iron, which, made, them, weak, compared, to, the, cast, bronze, guns, that, would, become, standard, in, the, 16th, century, early, on, guns, would, be, fixed, directly, to, the, bow, timbers, aimed, directly, forward, in, the, direction, of, travel, this, placement, would, remain, essentially, the, same, until, the, galley, disappeared, from, active, service, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, introduction, of, heavy, guns, and, handheld, firearms, did, not, change, tactics, considerably, if, anything, it, made, the, bow, even, more, important, in, offense, both, as, a, staging, area, for, boarders, and, the, obvious, place, for, concentrating, firepower, the, galley, itself, could, easily, outperform, most, sailing, vessels, before, the, establishment, of, the, full, rigged, ship, it, retained, a, distinct, tactical, advantage, even, after, the, initial, introduction, of, naval, artillery, because, of, the, ease, with, which, it, could, be, maneuvered, to, bare, its, guns, upon, an, opposing, vessel, galleys, were, frequently, used, for, ceremonial, purposes, in, early, modern, europe, galleys, enjoyed, a, level, of, prestige, that, sailing, vessels, could, not, compete, with, they, were, considered, to, be, more, closely, associated, with, warfare, on, land, and, fought, with, similar, tactics, naval, warfare, did, not, have, the, same, association, with, chivalry, and, martial, prowess, as, land, warfare, which, was, seen, as, the, ultimate, achievement, of, nobility, and, royalty, in, the, baltic, gustav, i, the, first, king, of, the, modern, swedish, state, showed, particular, interest, in, galleys, as, was, befitting, a, renaissance, prince, whenever, traveling, by, sea, gustav, his, court, royal, bureaucrats, and, his, bodyguardd, would, travel, by, galley, around, the, same, time, english, king, henry, viii, had, mediterranean, style, galleys, built, and, even, manned, them, with, slaves, though, the, english, navy, of, the, time, relied, mostly, on, sailing, ships, british, naval, historian, nicholas, rodger, has, described, the, galley, as, a, supreme, symbol, of, royal, power, derived, from, its, intimate, association, with, armies, and, consequently, with, princes, this, association, was, elevated, even, further, by, the, french, sun, king, louis, xiv, in, the, form, of, a, dedicated, galley, corps, louis, and, the, french, state, he, ruled, created, a, tool, and, symbol, of, royal, authority, that, did, little, fighting, but, was, a, potent, extension, of, absolutist, ambitions, galleys, were, built, to, scale, for, the, royal, flotilla, on, the, grand, canal, at, the, gardens, of, versailles, purely, for, the, amusement, of, the, court, french, royal, galleys, patrolled, the, mediterranean, forcing, ships, of, other, states, to, salute, the, king, s, banner, convoyed, ambassadors, and, cardinals, and, participated, obediently, in, naval, parades, and, royal, pageantry, historian, paul, bamford, has, described, galleys, as, vessels, that, must, have, appealed, to, military, men, and, to, aristocratic, officers, accustomed, to, being, obeyed, and, served, sentencing, criminals, political, dissenters, and, religious, deviants, to, the, galleys, also, turned, the, french, galley, corps, into, a, brutal, cost, effective, and, feared, prison, system, french, protestants, were, particularly, ill, treated, in, this, system, they, were, only, a, small, minority, of, the, prisoners, but, their, experiences, came, to, dominate, the, legacy, of, the, galley, corps, in, 1909, french, author, albert, savine, 1859, 1927, wrote, that, fter, the, bastille, the, galleys, were, the, greatest, horror, of, the, old, regime, long, after, convicts, stopped, serving, in, the, galleys, even, after, the, reign, of, napoleon, the, term, gal, rien, galley, rower, remained, a, general, term, for, forced, labor, and, convicts, serving, harsh, sentences, jane, jeruto, young, woman, nandi, kapsabet, district,
