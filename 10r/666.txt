a, controlled, access, highway, is, a, type, of, highway, that, has, been, designed, for, high, speed, vehicular, traffic, with, all, traffic, flow, ingress, and, egress, regulated, common, english, terms, are, freeway, motorway, and, expressway, other, similar, terms, include, throughway, or, thruway, and, parkway, some, of, these, may, be, limited, access, highways, although, this, term, can, also, refer, to, a, class, of, highways, with, somewhat, less, isolation, from, other, traffic, in, countries, following, the, vienna, convention, the, motorway, qualification, implies, that, walking, and, parking, are, forbidden, a, fully, controlled, access, highway, provides, an, unhindered, flow, of, traffic, with, no, traffic, signals, intersections, or, property, access, they, are, free, of, any, at, grade, crossings, with, other, roads, railways, or, pedestrian, paths, which, are, instead, carried, by, overpasses, and, underpasses, entrances, and, exits, to, the, highway, are, provided, at, interchanges, by, slip, roads, ramps, which, allow, for, speed, changes, between, the, highway, and, arterials, and, collector, roads, on, the, controlled, access, highway, opposing, directions, of, travel, are, generally, separated, by, a, median, strip, or, central, reservation, containing, a, traffic, barrier, or, grass, elimination, of, conflicts, with, other, directions, of, traffic, dramatically, improves, safety, while, increasing, traffic, capacity, and, speed, controlled, access, highways, evolved, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, italy, was, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, build, controlled, access, highways, reserved, for, fast, traffic, and, for, motor, vehicles, only, italy, opened, its, first, autostrada, in, 1924, a8, connecting, milan, to, varese, germany, began, to, build, its, first, controlled, access, autobahn, without, speed, limits, 30, kilometres, on, what, is, now, a555, then, referred, to, as, a, dual, highway, in, 1932, between, cologne, and, bonn, it, then, rapidly, constructed, the, first, nationwide, system, of, such, roads, the, first, north, american, freeways, known, as, parkways, opened, in, the, new, york, city, area, in, the, 1920s, britain, heavily, influenced, by, the, railways, did, not, build, its, first, motorway, the, preston, by, pass, m6, until, 1958, most, technologically, advanced, nations, feature, an, extensive, network, of, freeways, or, motorways, to, provide, high, capacity, urban, travel, or, high, speed, rural, travel, or, both, many, have, a, national, level, or, even, international, level, e, g, european, e, route, system, of, route, numbering, there, are, several, international, standards, that, give, some, definitions, of, words, such, as, motorways, but, there, is, no, formal, definition, of, the, english, language, words, such, as, freeway, motorway, and, expressway, or, of, the, equivalent, words, in, other, languages, such, as, autoroute, autobahn, autostrada, autocesta, autoput, that, are, accepted, worldwide, in, most, cases, these, words, are, defined, by, local, statute, or, design, standards, or, regional, international, treaties, descriptions, that, are, widely, used, include, one, green, or, blue, symbol, like, appears, at, motorway, entry, in, countries, that, follow, the, vienna, convention, exits, are, marked, with, another, symbol, the, definitions, of, motorway, from, the, oecd, and, piarc, are, almost, identical, in, the, european, union, for, statistical, and, safety, purposes, some, distinction, might, be, made, between, motorway, and, expressway, for, instance, a, principal, arterial, might, be, considered, as, roads, serving, long, distance, and, mainly, interurban, movements, includes, motorways, urban, or, rural, and, expressways, road, which, does, not, serve, properties, bordering, on, it, and, which, is, provided, with, separate, carriageways, for, the, two, directions, of, traffic, principal, arterials, may, cross, through, urban, areas, serving, suburban, movements, the, traffic, is, characterized, by, high, speeds, and, full, or, partial, access, control, interchanges, or, junctions, controlled, by, traffic, lights, other, roads, leading, to, a, principal, arterial, are, connected, to, it, through, side, collector, roads, in, this, view, care, s, definition, stands, that, a, motorway, is, understood, as, a, public, road, with, dual, carriageways, and, at, least, two, lanes, each, way, all, entrances, and, exits, are, signposted, and, all, interchanges, are, grade, separated, central, barrier, or, median, present, throughout, the, road, no, crossing, is, permitted, while, stopping, is, permitted, only, in, an, emergency, restricted, access, to, motor, vehicles, prohibited, to, pedestrians, animals, pedal, cycles, mopeds, agricultural, vehicles, the, minimum, speed, is, not, lower, than, 50, km, h, and, the, maximum, speed, is, not, higher, than, 130, km, h, except, germany, where, no, speed, limit, is, defined, motorways, are, designed, to, carry, heavy, traffic, at, high, speed, with, the, lowest, possible, number, of, accidents, they, are, also, designed, to, collect, long, distance, traffic, from, other, roads, so, that, conflicts, between, long, distance, traffic, and, local, traffic, are, avoided, according, to, the, common, european, definition, a, motorway, is, defined, as, a, road, specially, designed, and, built, for, motor, traffic, which, does, not, serve, properties, bordering, on, it, and, which, a, is, provided, except, at, special, points, or, temporarily, with, separate, carriageways, for, the, two, directions, of, traffic, separated, from, each, other, either, by, a, dividing, strip, not, intended, for, traffic, or, exceptionally, by, other, means, b, does, not, cross, at, level, with, any, road, railway, or, tramway, track, or, footpath, c, is, specially, sign, posted, as, a, motorway, and, is, reserved, for, specific, categories, of, road, motor, vehicles, urban, motorways, are, also, included, in, this, definition, however, the, respective, national, definitions, and, the, type, of, roads, covered, may, present, slight, differences, in, different, eu, countries, the, first, version, of, modern, controlled, access, highways, evolved, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, long, island, motor, parkway, on, long, island, new, york, opened, in, 1908, as, a, private, venture, was, the, world, s, first, limited, access, roadway, it, included, many, modern, features, including, banked, turns, guard, rails, and, reinforced, concrete, tarmac, traffic, could, turn, left, between, the, parkway, and, connectors, crossing, oncoming, traffic, so, it, was, not, a, controlled, access, highway, or, freeway, as, later, defined, by, the, federal, government, s, manual, on, uniform, traffic, control, devices, modern, controlled, access, highways, originated, in, the, early, 1920s, in, response, to, the, rapidly, increasing, use, of, the, automobile, the, demand, for, faster, movement, between, cities, and, as, a, consequence, of, improvements, in, paving, processes, techniques, and, materials, these, original, high, speed, roads, were, referred, to, as, dual, highways, and, have, been, modernized, and, are, still, in, use, today, italy, was, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, build, controlled, access, highways, reserved, for, fast, traffic, and, for, motor, vehicles, only, the, autostrada, dei, laghi, lakes, motorway, the, first, built, in, the, world, connecting, milan, to, lake, como, and, lake, maggiore, and, now, parts, of, the, a8, and, a9, motorways, was, devised, by, piero, puricelli, and, was, inaugurated, in, 1924, this, motorway, called, autostrada, contained, only, one, lane, in, each, direction, and, no, interchanges, the, bronx, river, parkway, was, the, first, road, in, north, america, to, utilize, a, median, strip, to, separate, the, opposing, lanes, to, be, constructed, through, a, park, and, where, intersecting, streets, crossed, over, bridges, the, southern, state, parkway, opened, in, 1927, while, the, long, island, motor, parkway, was, closed, in, 1937, and, replaced, by, the, northern, state, parkway, opened, 1931, and, the, contiguous, grand, central, parkway, opened, 1936, in, germany, construction, of, the, bonn, cologne, autobahn, began, in, 1929, and, was, opened, in, 1932, by, konrad, adenauer, then, the, mayor, of, cologne, the, german, autobahn, became, the, first, nationwide, highway, system, in, canada, the, first, precursor, with, semi, controlled, access, was, the, middle, road, between, hamilton, and, toronto, which, featured, a, median, divider, between, opposing, traffic, flow, as, well, as, the, nation, s, first, cloverleaf, interchange, this, highway, developed, into, the, queen, elizabeth, way, which, featured, a, cloverleaf, and, trumpet, interchange, when, it, opened, in, 1937, and, until, the, second, world, war, boasted, the, longest, illuminated, stretch, of, roadway, built, a, decade, later, the, first, section, of, highway, 401, was, opened, based, on, earlier, designs, it, has, since, gone, on, to, become, the, busiest, highway, in, the, world, the, word, freeway, was, first, used, in, february, 1930, by, edward, m, bassett, bassett, argued, that, roads, should, be, classified, into, three, basic, types, highways, parkways, and, freeways, in, bassett, s, zoning, and, property, law, based, system, abutting, property, owners, have, the, rights, of, light, air, and, access, to, highways, but, not, parkways, and, freeways, the, latter, two, are, distinguished, in, that, the, purpose, of, a, parkway, is, recreation, while, the, purpose, of, a, freeway, is, movement, thus, as, originally, conceived, a, freeway, is, simply, a, strip, of, public, land, devoted, to, movement, to, which, abutting, property, owners, do, not, have, rights, of, light, air, or, access, freeways, by, definition, have, no, at, grade, intersections, with, other, roads, railroads, or, multi, use, trails, therefore, no, traffic, signals, are, needed, and, through, traffic, on, freeways, does, not, normally, need, to, stop, at, traffic, signals, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, allow, for, limited, exceptions, some, movable, bridges, for, instance, the, interstate, bridge, on, interstate, 5, between, oregon, and, washington, do, require, drivers, to, stop, for, ship, traffic, the, crossing, of, freeways, by, other, routes, is, typically, achieved, with, grade, separation, either, in, the, form, of, underpasses, or, overpasses, in, addition, to, sidewalks, pavements, attached, to, roads, that, cross, a, freeway, specialized, pedestrian, footbridges, or, tunnels, may, also, be, provided, these, structures, enable, pedestrians, and, cyclists, to, cross, the, freeway, at, that, point, without, a, detour, to, the, nearest, road, crossing, access, to, freeways, is, typically, provided, only, at, grade, separated, interchanges, though, lower, standard, right, in, right, out, left, in, left, out, in, countries, that, drive, on, the, left, access, can, be, used, for, direct, connections, to, side, roads, in, many, cases, sophisticated, interchanges, allow, for, smooth, uninterrupted, transitions, between, intersecting, freeways, and, busy, arterial, roads, however, sometimes, it, is, necessary, to, exit, onto, a, surface, road, to, transfer, from, one, freeway, to, another, one, example, in, the, united, states, notorious, for, the, resulting, congestion, is, the, connection, from, interstate, 70, to, the, pennsylvania, turnpike, interstate, 70, and, interstate, 76, through, the, town, of, breezewood, pennsylvania, speed, limits, are, generally, higher, on, freeways, and, are, occasionally, nonexistent, as, on, much, of, germany, s, autobahn, network, because, higher, speeds, reduce, decision, time, freeways, are, usually, equipped, with, a, larger, number, of, guide, signs, than, other, roads, and, the, signs, themselves, are, physically, larger, guide, signs, are, often, mounted, on, overpasses, or, overhead, gantries, so, that, drivers, can, see, where, each, lane, goes, exit, numbers, are, commonly, derived, from, the, exit, s, distance, in, miles, or, kilometers, from, the, start, of, the, freeway, in, some, areas, there, are, public, rest, areas, or, service, areas, on, freeways, as, well, as, emergency, phones, on, the, shoulder, at, regular, intervals, in, the, united, states, mileposts, usually, start, at, the, southern, or, westernmost, point, on, the, freeway, either, its, terminus, or, the, state, line, california, ohio, and, nevada, use, postmile, systems, in, which, the, markers, indicate, mileage, through, the, state, s, individual, counties, however, nevada, and, ohio, also, use, the, standard, milepost, system, concurrently, with, their, respective, postmile, systems, california, numbers, its, exits, off, its, freeways, according, to, a, milepost, system, but, does, not, use, milepost, markers, in, europe, and, some, other, countries, motorways, typically, have, similar, characteristics, such, as, two, lane, freeways, often, undivided, are, sometimes, built, when, traffic, volumes, are, low, or, right, of, way, is, limited, they, may, be, designed, for, easy, conversion, to, one, side, of, a, four, lane, freeway, for, example, most, of, the, bert, t, combs, mountain, parkway, in, eastern, kentucky, is, two, lanes, but, work, has, begun, to, make, all, of, it, four, lane, these, are, often, called, super, two, roads, several, such, roads, are, infamous, for, a, high, rate, of, lethal, crashes, an, outcome, because, they, were, designed, for, short, sight, distances, sufficient, for, freeways, without, oncoming, traffic, but, insufficient, for, the, years, in, service, as, two, lane, road, with, oncoming, traffic, an, example, of, such, a, highway, to, hell, was, european, route, e4, from, g, vle, to, axmartavlan, sweden, the, high, rate, of, crashes, with, severe, personal, injuries, on, that, and, similar, roads, did, not, cease, until, a, median, crash, barrier, was, installed, transforming, the, fatal, crashes, into, non, fatal, crashes, otherwise, freeways, typically, have, at, least, two, lanes, in, each, direction, some, busy, ones, can, have, as, many, as, 16, or, more, lanes, in, total, in, san, diego, california, interstate, 5, has, a, similar, system, of, express, and, local, lanes, for, a, maximum, width, of, 21, lanes, on, a, 2, mile, 3, 2, km, segment, between, interstate, 805, and, california, state, route, 56, in, mississauga, ontario, highway, 401, uses, collector, express, lanes, for, a, total, of, 18, lanes, through, its, intersection, with, highway, 403, highway, 410, and, highway, 427, these, wide, freeways, may, use, separate, collector, and, express, lanes, to, separate, through, traffic, from, local, traffic, or, special, high, occupancy, vehicle, lanes, either, as, a, special, restriction, on, the, innermost, lane, or, a, separate, roadway, to, encourage, carpooling, these, hov, lanes, or, roadways, open, to, all, traffic, can, be, reversible, lanes, providing, more, capacity, in, the, direction, of, heavy, traffic, and, reversing, direction, before, traffic, switches, sometimes, a, collector, distributor, road, a, shorter, version, of, a, local, lane, shifts, weaving, between, closely, spaced, interchanges, to, a, separate, roadway, or, altogether, eliminates, it, in, some, parts, of, the, world, notably, parts, of, the, us, frontage, roads, form, an, integral, part, of, the, freeway, system, these, parallel, surface, roads, provide, a, transition, between, high, speed, through, traffic, and, local, traffic, frequent, slip, ramps, provide, access, between, the, freeway, and, the, frontage, road, which, in, turn, provides, direct, access, to, local, roads, and, businesses, except, on, some, two, lane, freeways, and, very, rarely, on, wider, freeways, a, median, separates, the, opposite, directions, of, traffic, this, strip, may, be, as, simple, as, a, grassy, area, or, may, include, a, crash, barrier, such, as, a, jersey, barrier, or, an, ontario, tall, wall, to, prevent, head, on, collisions, on, some, freeways, the, two, carriageways, are, built, on, different, alignments, this, may, be, done, to, make, use, of, available, corridors, in, a, mountainous, area, or, to, provide, narrower, corridors, through, dense, urban, areas, control, of, access, relates, to, a, legal, status, which, limits, the, types, of, vehicles, that, can, use, a, highway, as, well, as, a, road, design, that, limits, the, points, at, which, they, can, access, it, major, arterial, roads, will, often, have, partial, access, control, meaning, that, side, roads, will, intersect, the, main, road, at, grade, instead, of, using, interchanges, but, driveways, may, not, connect, directly, to, the, main, road, and, drivers, must, use, intersecting, roads, to, access, adjacent, land, at, arterial, junctions, with, relatively, quiet, side, roads, traffic, is, controlled, mainly, by, two, way, stop, signs, which, do, not, impose, significant, interruptions, on, traffic, using, the, main, highway, roundabouts, are, often, used, at, busier, intersections, in, europe, because, they, help, minimize, interruptions, in, flow, while, traffic, signals, that, create, greater, interference, with, traffic, are, still, preferred, in, north, america, there, may, be, occasional, interchanges, with, other, major, arterial, roads, examples, include, us, 23, between, sr, 15, s, eastern, terminus, and, delaware, ohio, along, with, sr, 15, between, its, eastern, terminus, and, i, 75, us, 30, sr, 29, us, 33, and, us, 35, in, western, and, central, ohio, this, type, of, road, is, sometimes, called, an, expressway, freeways, are, usually, limited, to, motor, vehicles, of, a, minimum, power, or, weight, signs, may, prohibit, cyclists, pedestrians, and, equestrians, and, impose, a, minimum, speed, it, is, possible, for, non, motorized, traffic, to, use, facilities, within, the, same, right, of, way, such, as, sidewalks, constructed, along, freeway, standard, bridges, and, multi, use, paths, next, to, freeways, such, as, the, suncoast, trail, along, the, suncoast, parkway, in, florida, in, some, us, jurisdictions, especially, where, freeways, replace, existing, roads, non, motorized, access, on, freeways, is, permitted, different, states, of, the, united, states, have, different, laws, cycling, on, freeways, in, arizona, may, be, prohibited, only, where, there, is, an, alternative, route, judged, equal, or, better, for, cycling, wyoming, the, second, least, densely, populated, state, allows, cycling, on, all, freeways, oregon, allows, bicycles, except, on, specific, urban, freeways, in, portland, and, medford, in, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, new, motorways, require, an, act, of, parliament, to, ensure, restricted, right, of, way, since, upgrading, an, existing, road, the, king, s, highway, to, a, full, motorway, will, result, in, extinguishing, the, right, of, access, of, certain, groups, such, as, pedestrians, cyclists, and, slow, moving, traffic, many, controlled, access, roads, are, not, full, motorways, in, some, cases, motorways, are, linked, by, short, stretches, of, road, where, alternative, rights, of, way, are, not, practicable, such, as, the, dartford, crossing, the, furthest, downstream, public, crossing, of, the, river, thames, or, where, it, was, not, economic, to, build, a, motorway, alongside, the, existing, road, such, as, the, former, cumberland, gap, the, a1, is, a, good, example, of, piece, wise, upgrading, to, motorway, standard, as, of, january, 2013, the, 639, kilometre, long, 397, mi, route, had, five, stretches, of, motorway, designated, as, a1, m, reducing, to, four, stretches, in, march, 2018, with, completion, of, the, a1, m, through, north, yorkshire, the, most, frequent, way, freeways, are, laid, out, is, by, building, them, from, the, ground, up, after, obstructions, such, as, forestry, or, buildings, are, cleared, away, sometimes, they, deplete, farmland, but, other, methods, have, been, developed, for, economic, social, and, even, environmental, reasons, full, freeways, are, sometimes, made, by, converting, at, grade, expressways, or, by, replacing, at, grade, intersections, with, overpasses, however, in, the, us, any, at, grade, intersection, that, ends, a, freeway, often, remains, an, at, grade, intersection, often, when, there, is, a, two, lane, undivided, freeway, or, expressway, it, is, converted, by, constructing, a, parallel, twin, corridor, and, leaving, a, median, between, the, two, travel, directions, the, median, side, travel, lane, of, the, old, two, way, corridor, becomes, a, passing, lane, other, techniques, involve, building, a, new, carriageway, on, the, side, of, a, divided, highway, that, has, a, lot, of, private, access, on, one, side, and, sometimes, has, long, driveways, on, the, other, side, since, an, easement, for, widening, comes, into, place, especially, in, rural, areas, when, a, third, carriageway, is, added, sometimes, it, can, shift, a, directional, carriageway, by, 20, 60, metres, 50, 200, ft, or, maybe, more, depending, on, land, availability, as, a, way, to, retain, private, access, on, one, side, that, favors, over, the, other, other, methods, involve, constructing, a, service, drive, that, shortens, the, long, driveways, typically, by, less, than, 100, metres, 330, ft, an, interchange, or, a, junction, is, a, highway, layout, that, permits, traffic, from, one, controlled, access, highway, to, access, another, and, vice, versa, whereas, an, access, point, is, a, highway, layout, where, traffic, from, a, distributor, or, local, road, can, join, a, controlled, access, highway, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, do, not, distinguish, between, the, two, but, others, make, a, distinction, for, example, germany, uses, the, words, kreuz, cross, or, dreieck, triangle, for, the, former, and, ausfahrt, exit, for, the, latter, in, all, cases, one, road, crosses, the, other, via, a, bridge, or, a, tunnel, as, opposed, to, an, at, grade, crossing, the, inter, connecting, roads, or, slip, roads, which, link, the, two, roads, can, follow, any, one, of, a, number, of, patterns, the, actual, pattern, is, determined, by, a, number, of, factors, including, local, topology, traffic, density, land, cost, building, costs, type, of, road, etc, in, some, jurisdictions, feeder, distributor, lanes, are, common, especially, for, cloverleaf, interchanges, in, others, such, as, the, united, kingdom, where, the, roundabout, interchange, is, common, feeder, distributor, lanes, are, seldom, seen, motorways, in, europe, typically, differ, between, exits, and, junctions, an, exit, leads, out, of, the, motorway, system, whilst, a, junction, is, a, crossing, between, motorways, or, a, split, merge, of, two, motorways, the, motorway, rules, end, at, exits, but, not, at, junctions, however, on, some, bridges, motorways, without, changing, appearance, temporarily, end, between, the, two, exits, closest, to, the, bridge, or, tunnel, and, continue, as, dual, carriageways, this, is, in, order, to, give, slower, vehicles, a, possibility, to, use, the, bridge, the, queen, elizabeth, ii, bridge, dartford, tunnel, at, london, orbital, is, an, example, of, this, london, orbital, or, the, m25, is, a, motorway, surrounding, london, but, at, the, last, river, thames, crossing, before, its, mouth, motorway, rules, do, not, apply, at, this, crossing, the, london, orbital, is, labeled, a282, instead, a, few, of, the, more, common, types, of, junction, are, shown, below, there, are, many, differences, between, countries, in, their, geography, economy, traffic, growth, highway, system, size, degree, of, urbanization, and, motorization, etc, all, of, which, need, to, be, taken, into, consideration, when, comparisons, are, made, according, to, some, eu, papers, safety, progress, on, motorways, is, the, result, of, several, changes, including, infrastructure, safety, and, road, user, behavior, speed, or, seat, belt, use, while, other, matters, such, as, vehicle, safety, and, mobility, patterns, have, an, impact, that, has, not, been, quantified, motorways, are, the, safest, roads, by, design, while, accounting, for, more, than, one, quarter, of, all, kilometres, driven, they, contributed, only, 8, of, the, total, number, of, european, road, deaths, in, 2006, germany, s, federal, highway, research, institute, provided, international, road, traffic, and, accident, database, irtad, statistics, for, the, year, 2010, comparing, overall, fatality, rates, with, motorway, rates, regardless, of, traffic, intensity, the, german, autobahn, network, illustrates, the, safety, trade, offs, of, controlled, access, highways, the, injury, crash, rate, is, very, low, on, autobahns, while, 22, people, died, per, 1, 000, injury, crashes, although, autobahns, have, a, lower, rate, than, the, 29, deaths, per, 1, 000, injury, accidents, on, conventional, rural, roads, the, rate, is, higher, than, the, risk, on, urban, roads, speeds, are, higher, on, rural, roads, and, autobahns, than, urban, roads, increasing, the, severity, potential, of, a, crash, according, to, etsc, german, motorways, without, a, speed, limit, but, with, a, 130, km, h, 81, mph, speed, recommendation, are, 25, more, deadly, than, motorways, with, a, speed, limit, germany, also, introduced, some, 130, km, h, 81, mph, speed, limits, on, various, motorway, sections, which, were, not, limited, this, generated, a, reduction, in, deaths, in, a, range, from, 20, to, 50, on, those, sections, speed, in, europe, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, main, contributory, factors, to, collisions, some, countries, such, as, france, and, switzerland, have, achieved, a, death, reduction, by, a, better, monitoring, of, speed, tools, used, for, monitoring, speed, might, be, an, increase, in, traffic, density, improved, speed, enforcement, and, stricter, regulation, leading, to, driver, license, withdrawal, safety, cameras, penalty, point, and, higher, fines, some, other, countries, use, automatic, time, over, distance, cameras, also, known, as, section, controls, to, manage, speed, fatigue, is, considered, as, a, risk, factor, more, specific, to, monotonous, roads, such, as, motorways, although, such, data, are, not, monitored, recorded, in, many, countries, according, to, vinci, autoroutes, one, third, of, accidents, in, french, motorways, are, due, to, sleepy, driving, 23, of, people, killed, on, french, motorways, were, not, wearing, seat, belts, while, 98, of, front, seat, passengers, and, 87, of, rear, seat, passenger, wear, seat, belts, although, safety, results, do, not, change, much, from, year, to, year, in, europe, some, changes, have, been, observed, motorway, fatalities, decreased, by, 41, during, the, 2006, 2015, decade, but, increased, by, 10, between, 2014, and, 2015, however, taking, into, account, motorway, network, length, to, reflect, exposure, data, shows, that, fatalities, per, thousand, kilometres, halved, between, 2006, and, 2015, a, university, of, barcelona, study, suggests, that, if, tolls, are, implemented, on, a, controlled, access, highway, drivers, may, seek, alternative, routes, to, avoid, paying, the, tolls, this, may, result, in, a, decrease, of, safety, on, roads, which, are, not, designed, for, heavy, traffic, in, the, united, kingdom, there, are, very, few, studies, regarding, the, impact, of, road, traffic, accidents, from, existing, and, new, urban, motorways, in, particular, new, urban, motorways, do, not, grant, a, reduction, of, traffic, accidents, in, italy, a, study, performed, on, urban, motorway, a56, tangenziale, di, napoli, showed, that, reduction, of, speed, leads, to, a, decrease, in, accidents, in, marseille, france, from, june, 2009, to, may, 2010, cerema, the, french, centre, for, studies, on, risk, mobility, and, environment, performed, a, study, on, marius, a, network, of, urban, motorways, this, study, established, a, link, between, accidents, and, traffic, variables, the, 150, kilometre, long, 93, mi, marius, network, counts, 292, injury, accidents, or, fatalities, for, 1, 5, billion, of, vehicle, kilometres, that, is, 189, injury, accidents, or, fatalities, for, 1, billion, of, vehicle, kilometres, some, european, countries, have, improved, safety, of, urban, motorways, with, a, set, of, measures, to, dynamically, manage, traffic, flow, in, response, to, changing, volumes, speeds, and, incidents, including, in, 1994, it, was, assumed, that, lighting, urban, motorways, would, benefit, from, more, safety, than, unlighted, ones, in, california, in, 2001, a, study, established, for, urban, freeways, some, relationships, among, urban, freeway, accidents, traffic, flow, weather, and, lighting, conditions, controlled, access, highways, have, been, constructed, both, between, major, cities, as, well, as, within, them, leading, to, the, sprawling, suburban, development, found, near, most, modern, cities, highways, have, been, heavily, criticized, by, environmentalists, urbanists, and, preservationists, for, the, noise, pollution, and, economic, shifts, they, bring, additionally, they, have, been, criticized, by, the, driving, public, for, the, inefficiency, with, which, they, handle, peak, hour, traffic, often, rural, highways, open, up, vast, areas, to, economic, development, and, municipal, services, generally, raising, property, values, in, contrast, to, this, above, grade, highways, in, urban, areas, are, often, a, source, of, lowered, property, values, contributing, to, urban, decay, even, with, overpasses, and, underpasses, neighbourhoods, are, divided, especially, impoverished, ones, where, residents, are, less, likely, to, own, a, car, or, to, have, the, political, and, economic, influence, to, resist, construction, efforts, beginning, in, the, early, 1970s, the, us, congress, identified, freeways, and, other, urban, highways, as, responsible, for, most, of, the, noise, exposure, of, the, us, population, subsequently, computer, models, were, developed, to, analyze, freeway, noise, and, aid, in, their, design, to, help, minimize, noise, exposure, some, cities, have, implemented, freeway, removal, policies, under, which, freeways, have, been, demolished, and, reclaimed, as, boulevards, or, parks, notably, in, seoul, cheonggyecheon, portland, harbor, drive, new, york, city, west, side, elevated, highway, boston, central, artery, san, francisco, embarcadero, freeway, seattle, alaskan, way, viaduct, and, milwaukee, park, east, freeway, an, alternative, to, surface, or, above, ground, freeway, construction, has, been, the, construction, of, underground, urban, freeways, using, tunnelling, technologies, this, has, been, employed, in, madrid, and, prague, as, well, as, the, australian, cities, of, sydney, which, has, five, such, freeways, brisbane, which, has, three, and, melbourne, which, has, two, this, has, had, the, benefit, of, not, creating, heavily, trafficked, surface, roads, and, in, the, case, of, melbourne, s, eastlink, freeway, prevented, the, destruction, of, an, ecologically, sensitive, area, other, australian, cities, face, similar, problems, lack, of, available, land, cost, of, home, acquisition, aesthetic, problems, and, community, opposition, brisbane, which, also, has, to, contend, with, physical, boundaries, the, brisbane, river, and, rapid, population, increases, has, embraced, underground, freeways, there, are, currently, three, open, to, traffic, clem, jones, tunnel, clem7, airport, link, and, legacy, way, and, one, east, west, link, is, currently, in, planning, all, of, the, tunnels, are, designed, to, act, as, an, inner, city, ring, road, or, bypass, system, and, include, provision, for, public, transport, whether, underground, or, in, reclaimed, space, on, the, surface, however, freeways, are, not, beneficial, for, road, based, public, transport, services, because, the, restricted, access, to, the, roadway, means, that, it, is, awkward, for, passengers, to, get, to, the, limited, number, of, boarding, points, unless, they, drive, to, them, largely, defeating, the, purpose, in, canada, the, extension, of, highway, 401, toward, detroit, known, as, the, herb, gray, parkway, has, been, designed, with, numerous, tunnels, and, underpasses, that, provide, land, for, parks, and, recreational, uses, freeway, opponents, have, found, that, freeway, expansion, is, often, self, defeating, expansion, simply, generates, more, traffic, that, is, even, if, traffic, congestion, is, initially, shifted, from, local, streets, to, a, new, or, widened, freeway, people, will, begin, to, use, their, cars, more, and, commute, from, more, remote, locations, over, time, the, freeway, and, its, environs, become, congested, again, as, both, the, average, number, and, distance, of, trips, increases, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, induced, demand, urban, planning, experts, such, as, drusilla, van, hengel, joseph, dimento, and, sherry, ryan, argue, that, although, properly, designed, and, maintained, freeways, may, be, convenient, and, safe, at, least, in, comparison, to, uncontrolled, roads, they, may, not, expand, recreation, employment, and, education, opportunities, equally, for, different, ethnic, groups, or, for, people, located, in, certain, neighborhoods, of, any, given, city, still, they, may, open, new, markets, to, some, small, businesses, construction, of, urban, freeways, for, the, us, interstate, highway, system, which, began, in, the, late, 1950s, led, to, the, demolition, of, thousands, of, city, blocks, and, the, dislocation, of, many, more, thousands, of, people, the, citizens, of, many, inner, city, areas, responded, with, the, freeway, and, expressway, revolts, through, the, study, of, washington, s, response, it, can, be, shown, that, the, most, effective, changes, came, not, from, executive, or, legislative, action, but, instead, from, policy, implementation, one, of, the, foremost, rationales, for, the, creation, of, the, united, states, department, of, transportation, usdot, was, that, an, agency, was, needed, to, mediate, between, the, conflicting, interests, of, interstates, and, cities, initially, these, policies, came, as, regulation, of, the, state, highway, departments, over, time, usdot, officials, re, focused, highway, building, from, a, national, level, to, the, local, scale, with, this, shift, of, perspective, came, an, encouragement, for, alternative, transportation, and, locally, based, planning, agencies, at, present, freeway, expansion, has, largely, stalled, in, the, united, states, due, to, a, multitude, of, factors, that, converged, in, the, 1970s, higher, due, process, requirements, prior, to, taking, of, private, property, increasing, land, values, increasing, costs, for, construction, materials, local, opposition, to, new, freeways, in, urban, cores, the, passage, of, the, national, environmental, policy, act, which, imposed, the, requirement, that, each, new, federally, funded, project, must, have, an, environmental, impact, statement, or, report, and, falling, gas, tax, revenues, as, a, result, of, the, nature, of, the, flat, cent, tax, it, is, not, automatically, adjusted, for, inflation, the, tax, revolt, movement, and, growing, popular, support, for, high, speed, mass, transit, in, lieu, of, new, freeways, england, and, wales, in, england, and, wales, the, numbers, of, major, motorways, followed, a, numbering, system, separate, from, that, of, the, a, road, network, though, based, on, the, same, principle, of, zones, running, clockwise, from, the, m1, the, zones, were, defined, for, zones, 1, to, 4, based, on, the, proposed, m2, m3, and, m4, motorways, the, m5, and, m6, numbers, were, reserved, for, the, other, two, planned, long, distance, motorways, the, preston, bypass, the, uk, s, first, motorway, should, have, been, numbered, a6, m, under, the, scheme, decided, upon, but, it, was, decided, to, keep, the, number, m6, as, it, had, already, been, applied, a, map, showing, future, pattern, of, principal, national, routes, was, issued, by, the, ministry, of, war, transport, in, 1946, shortly, before, the, law, that, allowed, roads, to, be, restricted, to, specified, classes, of, vehicle, the, special, roads, act, 1949, was, passed, the, first, section, of, motorway, the, m6, preston, bypass, opened, in, 1958, followed, by, the, first, major, section, of, motorway, the, m1, between, crick, and, berrygrove, in, watford, which, opened, in, 1959, from, then, until, the, 1980s, motorways, opened, at, frequent, intervals, by, 1972, the, first, 1, 600, kilometres, 1, 000, mi, of, motorway, had, been, built, whilst, roads, outside, of, urban, areas, continued, to, be, built, throughout, the, 1970s, opposition, to, urban, routes, became, more, pronounced, most, notably, plans, by, the, greater, london, council, for, a, series, of, ringways, were, cancelled, following, extensive, road, protests, and, a, rise, in, costs, in, 1986, the, single, ring, m25, motorway, was, completed, as, a, compromise, in, 1996, the, total, length, of, motorways, reached, 3, 200, kilometres, 2, 000, mi, motorways, in, great, britain, as, in, numerous, european, countries, will, nearly, always, have, the, following, characteristics, it, was, proposed, in, 2013, that, the, ax, m, format, number, would, be, used, for, the, highest, standard, of, a, new, classification, of, road, referred, to, in, england, as, expressways, which, would, be, roads, without, normal, roundabouts, or, right, turns, across, the, central, reservation, and, with, graded, junctions, such, roads, would, have, motorway, style, restrictions, but, emergency, reservations, rather, than, standard, major, motorway, standard, hard, shoulders, scotland, in, scotland, where, the, scottish, office, superseded, by, the, scottish, executive, in, 1999, rather, than, the, ministry, of, transport, and, civil, aviation, had, the, decision, there, is, no, zonal, pattern, but, rather, the, a, road, rule, is, strictly, enforced, it, was, decided, to, reserve, the, numbers, 7, 8, and, 9, for, scotland, the, m8, follows, the, route, of, the, a8, and, the, a90, became, part, of, the, m90, when, the, a90, was, re, routed, along, the, path, of, the, a85, motorways, follow, an, m, format, with, two, exceptions, the, a823, m, near, rosyth, joining, the, a823, to, the, m90, and, the, a74, m, between, the, english, m6, at, gretna, and, the, m74, at, abington, in, northern, ireland, a, distinct, numbering, system, is, used, which, is, separate, from, the, rest, of, the, united, kingdom, though, the, classification, of, roads, along, the, lines, of, a, b, and, c, is, universal, throughout, the, uk, and, the, isle, of, man, according, to, a, written, answer, to, a, parliamentary, question, to, the, northern, ireland, minister, for, regional, development, there, is, no, known, reason, as, to, how, northern, ireland, s, road, numbering, system, was, devised, however, motorways, as, in, the, rest, of, the, uk, are, numbered, m, with, the, two, major, motorways, coming, from, belfast, being, numbered, m1, and, m2, the, m12, is, a, short, spur, of, the, m1, with, the, m22, being, a, short, continuation, originally, intended, to, be, a, spur, of, the, m2, there, are, two, other, motorways, the, short, m3, the, m5, and, a, motorway, section, of, the, a8, road, known, as, the, a8, m, in, the, republic, of, ireland, motorway, and, national, road, numbering, is, quite, different, from, the, uk, convention, since, the, passage, of, the, roads, act, 1993, all, motorways, are, part, of, or, form, national, primary, roads, these, routes, are, numbered, in, series, usually, radiating, anti, clockwise, from, dublin, starting, with, the, n1, m1, using, numbers, from, 1, to, 33, and, separately, from, the, series, 50, motorways, use, the, number, of, the, route, of, which, they, form, part, with, an, m, prefix, rather, than, n, for, national, road, or, in, theory, rather, than, r, for, regional, road, in, most, cases, the, motorway, has, been, built, as, a, bypass, of, a, road, previously, forming, the, national, road, e, g, the, m7, bypassing, roads, previously, forming, the, n7, the, bypassed, roads, are, reclassified, as, regional, roads, although, updated, signposting, may, not, be, provided, for, some, time, and, adherence, to, signage, colour, conventions, is, lax, regional, roads, have, black, on, white, directional, signage, national, routes, use, white, on, green, under, the, previous, legislation, the, local, government, roads, and, motorways, act, 1974, motorways, theoretically, existed, independently, to, national, roads, however, the, short, sections, of, motorway, opened, during, this, act, except, for, the, m50, always, took, their, number, from, the, national, road, that, they, were, bypassing, the, older, road, was, not, downgraded, at, this, point, indeed, regional, roads, were, not, legislated, for, at, this, stage, older, signage, at, certain, junctions, on, the, m7, and, m11, can, be, seen, reflecting, this, earlier, scheme, where, for, example, n11, and, m11, can, be, seen, coexisting, the, m50, an, entirely, new, national, road, is, an, exception, to, the, normal, inheritance, process, as, it, does, not, replace, a, road, previously, carrying, an, n, number, the, m50, was, nevertheless, legislated, in, 1994, as, the, n50, route, it, had, only, a, short, section, of, non, motorway, section, from, the, junction, 11, tallaght, to, junction, 12, firhouse, until, its, extension, as, the, southern, cross, motorway, the, m50, s, designation, was, chosen, as, a, recognisable, number, as, of, 2010, the, n34, is, the, next, unused, national, primary, road, designation, in, theory, a, motorway, in, ireland, could, form, part, of, a, regional, road, in, australia, highway, and, motorway, also, called, freeway, or, expressway, numbers, either, use, alpha, numeric, route, markers, with, m, for, motorways, freeways, and, expressways, or, national, state, route, markers, before, the, implementation, of, alpha, numeric, route, markers, controlled, access, highways, were, marked, with, a, metroad, national, highway, national, route, or, state, route, marker, in, sydney, metroad, route, markers, were, used, for, motorways, and, freeways, except, the, pacific, motorway, then, f3, freeway, which, was, marked, with, a, national, highway, marker, in, brisbane, metroad, state, routes, were, used, for, motorways, and, freeways, in, melbourne, all, motorways, and, freeways, used, state, route, markers, in, western, australia, national, route, markers, are, used, for, expressways, and, freeways, after, the, implementation, of, alpha, numeric, route, markers, all, route, markers, being, used, for, motorways, and, freeways, in, sydney, and, melbourne, were, replaced, with, a, m, marker, in, brisbane, all, but, one, motorway, had, its, route, marker, replaced, western, fwy, in, western, australia, they, have, not, implemented, the, new, system, yet, in, hungary, similar, to, ireland, motorway, numbers, can, be, derived, from, the, original, national, highway, numbers, 1, 7, with, an, m, prefix, attached, e, g, m7, is, on, the, route, of, the, old, highway, 7, from, budapest, towards, lake, balaton, and, croatia, new, motorways, not, following, the, original, budapest, centred, radial, highway, system, get, numbers, m8, m9, etc, or, m0, in, the, case, of, the, ring, road, around, budapest, in, the, netherlands, motorway, numbers, can, be, derived, from, the, original, national, highway, numbers, but, with, an, a, autosnelweg, prefix, attached, like, a9, in, germany, federal, motorways, have, the, prefix, a, autobahn, if, the, following, number, is, odd, the, motorway, generally, follows, a, north, south, direction, while, even, numbered, motorways, generally, follow, an, east, west, direction, other, controlled, access, roads, dual, carriageways, in, germany, can, be, federal, highways, bundesstra, en, state, highways, landesstra, en, district, highways, kreisstra, en, and, city, highways, stadtstra, en, each, with, their, own, numbering, system, in, italy, motorways, follow, a, single, numbering, even, if, managed, by, different, concessionaire, companies, they, are, all, marked, with, the, letter, a, for, autostrada, ra, in, the, case, of, motorway, junctions, with, the, exception, of, the, bereguardo, pavia, junction, numbered, on, the, signs, as, autostrada, a53, and, t, for, the, international, alpine, tunnels, followed, by, a, number, therefore, a, motorway, with, the, same, numbering, can, be, managed, by, different, concessionaire, companies, for, example, the, autostrada, a23, is, managed, for, a, stretch, by, societ, autostrade, alto, adriatico, and, for, the, remaining, stretch, by, autostrade, per, l, italia, in, new, zealand, as, well, as, in, brazil, russia, finland, and, the, scandinavian, countries, motorway, numbers, are, derived, from, the, state, highway, route, that, they, form, a, part, of, but, unlike, hungary, and, ireland, they, are, not, distinguished, from, non, motorway, sections, of, the, same, state, highway, route, in, the, cases, where, a, new, motorway, acts, as, a, bypass, of, a, state, highway, route, the, original, state, highway, is, either, stripped, of, that, status, or, renumbered, a, low, road, number, means, a, road, suitable, for, long, distance, driving, in, belgium, motorways, but, also, some, dual, carriageways, have, numbers, preceded, by, an, a, however, those, that, also, have, an, e, number, are, generally, referenced, with, that, one, city, rings, and, bypasses, have, numbers, preceded, by, an, r, these, also, can, be, either, motorways, or, dual, carriageways, in, croatia, motorway, numbering, is, independent, of, state, route, numbering, motorways, are, prefixed, by, an, a, for, autocesta, as, in, many, other, european, countries, some, motorways, are, the, result, of, an, upgrade, of, an, older, two, lane, road, and, carry, concurrencies, with, state, routes, in, some, other, cases, such, as, with, the, a2, following, the, upgrade, the, state, route, was, rerouted, onto, the, frontage, road, while, the, design, characteristics, listed, above, are, generally, applicable, around, the, globe, every, jurisdiction, provides, its, own, specifications, and, design, criteria, for, controlled, access, highways, in, algeria, the, motorway, network, has, about, 2, 318, km, 1, 440, mi, in, 2x3, lanes, the, network, is, expanding, increasingly, along, with, other, kinds, of, infrastructure, though, this, is, only, true, for, the, northern, region, of, the, country, where, most, of, its, population, lives, and, this, infrastructure, is, pretty, well, developed, for, north, african, standards, for, the, moment, the, entire, algerian, motorway, network, is, toll, free, the, toll, stations, are,

spanish, carretera, federal, are, a, series, of, highways, that, connect, with, roads, from, foreign, countries, or, that, link, two, or, more, states, of, the, federation, in, the, united, states, a, freeway, is, defined, by, the, us, government, s, manual, on, uniform, traffic, control, devices, as, a, divided, highway, with, full, control, of, access, this, means, two, things, first, adjoining, property, owners, do, not, have, a, legal, right, of, access, meaning, all, existing, driveways, must, be, removed, and, access, to, adjacent, private, lands, must, be, blocked, with, fences, or, walls, instead, frontage, roads, provide, access, to, properties, adjacent, to, a, freeway, in, many, places, second, traffic, on, a, freeway, is, free, flowing, all, cross, traffic, and, left, turning, traffic, is, relegated, to, overpasses, or, underpasses, so, that, there, are, no, traffic, conflicts, on, the, main, line, of, the, highway, which, must, be, regulated, by, traffic, lights, stop, signs, or, other, traffic, control, devices, achieving, such, free, flow, requires, the, construction, of, many, overpasses, underpasses, and, ramp, systems, the, advantage, of, grade, separated, interchanges, is, that, freeway, drivers, can, almost, always, maintain, their, speed, at, junctions, since, they, do, not, need, to, yield, to, vehicles, crossing, perpendicular, to, mainline, traffic, in, contrast, an, expressway, is, defined, as, a, divided, highway, with, partial, control, of, access, expressways, may, have, driveways, and, at, grade, intersections, though, these, are, usually, less, numerous, than, on, ordinary, arterial, roads, this, distinction, was, apparently, first, developed, in, 1949, by, the, special, committee, on, nomenclature, of, what, is, now, the, american, association, of, state, highway, and, transportation, officials, prior, to, that, distinction, the, first, freeways, were, complete, in, 1940, the, pennsylvania, turnpike, and, the, arroyo, seco, parkway, pasadena, freeway, in, turn, the, definitions, were, incorporated, into, aashto, s, official, standards, book, the, manual, on, uniform, traffic, control, devices, which, would, become, the, national, standards, book, of, usdot, under, a, 1966, federal, statute, the, same, distinction, has, also, been, codified, into, the, statutory, law, of, eight, states, california, minnesota, mississippi, missouri, nebraska, north, dakota, ohio, and, wisconsin, however, each, state, codified, the, federal, distinction, slightly, differently, california, expressways, do, not, necessarily, have, to, be, divided, though, they, must, have, at, least, partial, access, control, for, both, terms, to, apply, in, wisconsin, a, divided, highway, must, be, at, least, four, lanes, wide, and, in, missouri, both, terms, apply, only, to, divided, highways, at, least, 16, km, 10, mi, long, that, are, not, part, of, the, interstate, highway, system, in, north, dakota, and, mississippi, expressways, may, have, full, or, partial, access, control, and, generally, have, grade, separations, at, intersections, a, freeway, is, then, defined, as, an, expressway, with, full, access, control, ohio, s, statute, is, similar, but, instead, of, the, vague, word, generally, it, imposes, a, requirement, that, 50, of, an, expressway, s, intersections, must, be, grade, separated, for, the, term, to, apply, only, minnesota, enacted, the, exact, mutcd, definitions, in, may, 2008, the, term, expressway, is, also, used, in, some, areas, of, the, country, for, what, the, federal, government, calls, freeways, where, the, terms, are, distinguished, freeways, can, be, characterized, as, expressways, upgraded, to, full, access, control, while, not, all, expressways, are, freeways, examples, in, the, united, states, of, roads, that, are, technically, expressways, under, the, federal, definition, but, contain, the, word, freeway, in, their, names, state, fair, freeway, in, kansas, chino, valley, freeway, in, california, rockaway, freeway, in, new, york, and, shenango, valley, freeway, a, portion, of, us, 62, in, pennsylvania, unlike, in, some, jurisdictions, not, all, freeways, in, the, us, are, part, of, a, single, national, freeway, network, although, together, with, non, freeways, they, form, the, national, highway, system, for, example, many, state, highways, such, as, california, state, route, 99, have, significant, freeway, sections, many, sections, of, the, older, united, states, numbered, highway, system, have, been, upgraded, to, freeways, but, have, kept, their, existing, us, highway, numbers, in, puerto, rico, controlled, access, highways, are, named, autopista, autopistas, are, tolled, roads, in, the, island, but, toll, cabins, do, exist, on,

curves, have, limit, of, 110, km, h, 68, mph, expressways, in, south, korea, were, originally, numbered, in, order, of, construction, since, 24, august, 2001, they, have, been, numbered, in, a, scheme, somewhat, similar, to, that, of, the, interstate, highway, system, in, the, united, states, furthermore, the, symbols, of, the, south, korean, highways, are, similar, to, the, us, red, white, and, blue, sri, lanka, currently, has, over, 350, km, 220, mi, of, designated, expressways, serving, the, southern, part, of, the, country, the, first, stage, of, the, e01, expressway, southern, expressway, which, opened, in, 2011, was, sri, lanka, s, first, expressway, spanning, a, distance, of, 95, 3, km, 59, 2, mi, the, second, stage, of, the, southern, expressway, opened, in, 2014, and, extends, to, matara, the, e03, expressway, colombo, katunayake, expressway, opened, in, 2013, and, connects, sri, lanka, s, largest, city, colombo, with, the, bandaranaike, international, airport, covering, a, distance, of, 25, 8, km, 16, 0, mi, all, e, grade, highways, in, sri, lanka, are, access, controlled, toll, roads, with, speeds, limits, in, the, range, of, 80, 110, km, h, 50, 68, mph, the, network, is, to, be, expanded, to, 518, 5, km, 322, 2, mi, by, 2024, operational, fully, or, partially, planned, syria, has, a, well, developed, system, of, motorways, in, the, western, half, of, the, country, as, the, eastern, part, is, underpopulated, it, only, has, 2, lanes, highways, have, been, important, in, terms, of, transport, for, the, ongoing, civil, war, the, main, motorways, are, taiwan, has, an, extensive, road, network, that, includes, two, types, of, controlled, access, highway, freeways, and, expressways, only, cars, and, trucks, are, allowed, onto, freeways, the, first, of, which, freeway, 1, was, completed, in, 1974, expressways, allow, car, and, truck, traffic, as, well, as, motorcycles, with, engines, of, 250cc, or, more, expressways, in, taiwan, may, be, controlled, access, highways, similar, to, national, freeways, or, limited, access, roads, most, have, urban, roads, and, intra, city, expressways, as, opposed, to, highway, system, status, although, some, are, built, and, maintained, by, cities, controlled, access, highways, in, thailand, are, separated, into, urban, expressways, called, expressways, which, are, operated, by, the, expressway, authority, of, thailand, and, bem, except, don, mueang, tollway, which, is, operated, by, don, muang, tollway, public, company, limited, and, have, a, span, of, 280, 4, km, 174, 2, mi, while, intercity, expressways, are, called, motorways, which, have, a, span, of, 187, km, 116, mi, the, network, is, to, be, extended, to, 4, 154, 7, km, 2, 581, 6, mi, according, to, the, master, plan, uzbekistan, has, 84, 400, km, 52, 400, mi, of, roads, about, 72, 000, km, 45, 000, mi, of, which, were, paved, much, of, the, highways, are, in, need, of, repair, although, the, condition, has, been, improving, in, 2017, the, governments, of, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, agreed, to, open, a, section, of, the, m39, highway, by, the, kazakh, border, at, present, the, expressway, system, of, vietnam, is, 895, km, 556, mi, long, under, the, government, s, plan, the, national, expressway, system, will, have, a, total, length, of, 6, 411, km, 3, 984, mi, the, expressway, system, in, vietnam, is, separate, from, the, national, highway, system, most, of, the, expressways, are, located, in, the, north, especially, around, hanoi, of, the, 21, expressways, in, vietnam, 8, emanate, from, hanoi, and, 14, are, in, the, north, with, a, length, of, 1, 368, km, 850, mi, the, first, expressway, in, vietnam, is, the, ho, chi, minh, city, trung, luong, expressway, which, is, inaugurated, and, opened, for, traffic, on, february, 3, 2010, currently, most, of, the, expressways, in, vietnam, are, four, lane, highways, with, some, routes, like, ha, noi, haiphong, and, phap, van, cau, gie, being, six, lane, the, only, elevated, expressway, in, vietnam, is, mai, dich, thanh, tri, bridge, also, known, as, the, third, beltway, in, hanoi, the, cost, of, building, vietnam, s, highways, is, one, of, the, most, expensive, in, the, world, with, an, average, cost, of, 12, million, per, kilometer, compared, with, china, where, there, are, similarities, their, highway, costs, only, 5, million, per, kilometer, where, in, the, us, and, european, countries, costs, 3, 4, million, per, kilometer, according, to, road, traffic, laws, of, vietnam, an, expressway, is, a, road, for, motor, vehicles, with, a, divider, separating, opposing, traffic, directions, no, at, grade, crossings, with, intersecting, roads, fully, equipped, facilities, to, ensure, continuous, traffic, flow, safety, and, short, journey, times, and, access, allowed, only, at, interchanges, regarding, road, function, motorways, serve, exclusively, the, function, of, flow, they, allow, for, efficient, throughput, of, usually, long, distance, motorized, traffic, with, unhindered, flow, of, traffic, no, traffic, signals, at, grade, intersections, or, property, access, and, elimination, of, conflicts, with, other, directions, of, traffic, thus, dramatically, improving, both, safety, and, capacity, although, roads, are, under, the, responsibility, of, each, individual, state, including, within, the, european, union, there, are, some, legal, conventions, international, treaties, and, some, european, directives, which, give, a, legal, framework, for, roads, of, a, european, importance, with, the, goal, to, introduce, some, kind, of, homogenization, between, various, members, they, basically, consider, at, european, level, three, types, of, roads, motorways, express, roads, and, ordinary, roads, some, european, treaties, also, define, aspects, such, as, the, range, of, speed, limit, or, for, some, geometric, aspects, of, roads, in, particularly, for, the, international, e, road, network, according, to, eurostat, a, motorway, is, a, road, specially, designed, and, built, for, motor, vehicle, traffic, which, does, not, directly, provide, access, to, the, properties, bordering, on, it, other, characteristics, of, motorways, include, in, determining, the, extent, of, a, motorway, its, entry, and, exit, lanes, are, included, irrespective, of, the, location, of, the, motorway, signposts, urban, motorways, are, also, included, in, this, term, most, of, the, european, countries, use, the, above, motorway, definition, but, different, national, definitions, of, motorways, can, be, found, in, some, countries, it, is, usually, considered, that, motorways, status, is, signaled, at, the, entry, and, exit, of, the, motorway, by, a, symbol, conforming, to, international, agreements, but, specific, to, each, country, the, peripheral, northern, and, eastern, regions, of, the, eu, have, a, lower, density, motorway, network, within, the, european, union, there, are, 26, regions, nuts, level, 2, with, no, motorway, network, in, 2013, those, regions, are, islands, or, remote, regions, for, instance, four, overseas, french, regions, and, corsica, the, baltic, member, state, of, latvia, as, well, as, four, regions, from, poland, and, two, regions, from, each, of, bulgaria, and, romania, also, reported, no, motorway, network, several, of, these, regions, bordered, onto, non, member, neighbouring, countries, to, the, east, of, the, eu, european, motorways, provide, reduced, accident, risks, 50, to, 90, lower, compared, to, standard, roads, when, new, motorways, only, reduce, injuries, by, 7, some, of, the, things, which, are, considered, as, providing, safety, in, the, european, motorways, are, central, medians, grade, separated, interchanges, and, access, restrictions, nonetheless, some, specific, conditions, provide, a, height, risk, of, a, more, severe, accidents, such, as, highways, in, albania, form, part, of, the, recent, albanian, road, system, following, the, collapse, of, communism, in, 1991, the, first, highways, in, albania, started, being, constructed, the, first, was, sh2, connecting, tirane, with, durr, s, via, vora, since, the, 2000s, main, roadways, have, drastically, improved, though, lacking, standards, in, design, and, road, safety, this, involved, the, construction, of, new, roadways, and, the, putting, of, contemporary, signs, however, some, state, roads, continue, to, deteriorate, from, lack, of, maintenance, while, others, remain, unfinished, the, austrian, autobahns, german, autobahnen, are, controlled, access, highways, in, austria, they, are, officially, called, bundesstra, en, a, bundesautobahnen, under, the, authority, of, the, federal, government, according, to, the, austrian, federal, road, act, bundesstra, engesetz, not, to, be, confused, with, the, former, bundesstra, en, highways, maintained, by, the, austrian, states, since, 2002, austria, currently, has, 18, autobahnen, since, 1982, built, and, maintained, by, the, self, financed, asfinag, stock, company, in, vienna, which, is, wholly, owned, by, the, austrian, republic, and, earns, revenue, from, road, user, charges, and, tolls, each, route, bears, a, number, as, well, as, an, official, name, with, local, reference, which, however, is, not, displayed, on, road, signs, unusually, for, european, countries, interchanges, between, motorways, called, knoten, knots, are, numbered, by, distance, in, kilometres, starting, from, where, the, route, begins, this, arrangement, is, also, used, in, the, czech, republic, slovakia, hungary, spain, and, most, provinces, of, canada, and, in, most, american, states, albeit, in, miles, the, current, austrian, autobahn, network, has, a, total, length, of, 1, 720, km, 1, 070, mi, in, 1937, the, first, motorway, between, brussels, and, ostend, was, completed, following, the, example, of, neighboring, countries, such, as, germany, it, mainly, served, local, industries, and, tourism, as, a, connection, between, the, capital, city, and, a, coastal, region, however, the, second, world, war, and, the, reparation, of, the, complete, road, network, after, the, war, caused, a, serious, delay, in, the, creation, of, other, motorways, in, 1949, the, first, plans, were, made, to, build, a, complete, motorway, network, of, 930, km, 580, mi, that, would, be, integrated, with, the, neighboring, networks, although, the, plans, were, ready, the, construction, of, the, motorway, network, was, much, slower, than, in, neighboring, countries, because, the, project, was, deemed, not, to, be, urgent, because, of, economic, growth, in, the, 1960s, more, citizens, could, afford, cars, and, the, call, for, good, quality, roads, was, higher, than, ever, before, in, each, year, between, 1965, and, 1973, over, 100, km, 62, mi, of, motorway, were, built, at, the, end, of, the, 1970s, the, construction, of, motorways, slowed, down, again, due, to, costs, combined, with, an, economic, crisis, more, expensive, fuel, and, changing, public, opinion, in, the, following, years, the, only, investments, done, were, to, complete, already, started, motorway, constructions, but, most, important, cities, were, already, connected, in, 1981, the, responsibilities, for, construction, and, maintenance, of, the, motorways, shifted, from, the, federal, to, the, regional, governments, this, sometimes, caused, tensions, between, the, governments, for, example, the, part, of, the, ring, road, around, brussels, that, crosses, wallonian, territory, has, never, been, finished, since, only, flanders, suffers, from, the, unfinished, ring, belgium, today, has, the, longest, total, motorway, length, per, area, unit, of, any, country, in, the, world, most, motorway, systems, in, belgium, have, at, least, three, lanes, in, each, direction, nearly, all, motorways, have, overhead, lighting, including, those, in, rural, areas, the, dense, population, of, belgium, and, the, still, unfinished, state, of, some, motorways, such, as, the, ring, roads, around, brussels, and, antwerp, cause, major, traffic, congestion, on, motorways, on, an, average, monday, morning, in, 2012, there, was, a, total, of, 356, km, 221, mi, of, traffic, jams, and, the, longest, traffic, jam, of, the, year, was, 1, 258, km, 782, mi, purely, on, the, motorways, bosnia, and, herzegovina, has, more, than, 208, km, 129, mi, of, highway, which, connects, kakanj, sarajevo, there, is, a, plan, to, build, highway, on, corridor, vc, which, will, go, from, river, sava, across, doboj, sarajevo, and, mostar, to, adriatic, sea, next, sections, are, kakanj, drivu, a, 16, km, 9, 9, mi, zenica, sjever, drivu, a, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, svilaj, od, ak, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, vlakovo, tar,

motorways, a, avtomagistrala, and, expressways, skorosten, pat, the, main, differences, are, that, motorways, have, emergency, lanes, and, the, maximum, allowed, speed, limit, is, 140, km, h, 87, mph, while, expressways, do, not, have, emergency, lanes, and, the, speed, limit, is, 120, km, h, 75, mph, as, of, june, 2018, 777, km, 483, mi, of, motorways, are, in, service, with, another, 62, km, 39, mi, under, various, stages, of, construction, more, than, 590, km, 370, mi, are, planned, also, several, expressways, are, planned, the, primary, high, speed, motorways, in, croatia, are, called, autoceste, singular, autocesta, croatian, pronunciation, and, they, are, defined, as, roads, with, at, least, two, lanes, in, each, direction, including, hard, shoulder, and, a, speed, limit, of, not, less, than, 80, km, h, 50, mph, the, typical, speed, limit, is, 130, km, h, 81, mph, as, of, 2017, there, are, 1, 313, km, 816, mi, of, motorways, in, croatia, there, is, also, a, category, known, as, brza, cesta, meaning, expressway, these, roads, have, a, speed, limit, up, to, 110, km, h, 68, mph, and, are, not, legally, required, to, be, grade, separated, but, nearly, all, are, motorways, greek, turkish, otoyol, connect, all, cities, in, cyprus, although, in, the, territory, under, de, facto, turkish, control, these, do, not, meet, international, standards, for, the, definition, of, motorways, in, the, areas, administered, by, the, republic, of, cyprus, motorway, numbers, are, prefaced, with, the, letter, a, and, run, from, a1, to, a6, to, distinguish, them, from, all, other, roads, designated, b, roads, of, the, a, roads, all, are, designated, motorways, except, for, the, a4, linking, larnaca, with, larnaca, airport, motorways, are, also, distinguishable, by, the, use, of, green, backed, road, signs, with, standard, international, graphics, and, text, in, yellow, in, greek, and, white, in, english, distinguishable, from, b, road, signage, which, has, signs, with, blue, backgrounds, motorway, junctions, are, theoretically, designated, with, junction, numbers, but, signage, is, not, consistent, is, indicating, the, exit, numbers, the, czech, republic, has,

extensively, modernised, throughout, the, 1980s, 1990s, and, especially, the, 2000s, while, part, of, it, is, still, under, construction, most, of, it, was, completed, by, mid, 2017, numbering, around, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, of, motorways, making, it, the, biggest, highway, network, in, southeastern, europe, and, the, balkans, and, one, of, the, most, advanced, in, europe, there, are, a, total, of, 10, main, routes, throughout, the, greek, mainland, and, crete, from, which, some, feature, numerous, branches, and, auxiliary, routes, most, important, motorways, are, the, a1, motorway, connecting, greece, s, two, largest, cities, athens, and, thessaloniki, the, a2, motorway, egnatia, odos, also, known, as, the, horizontal, road, axis, of, greece, connecting, almost, all, of,

1974, made, motorways, possible, although, the, first, section, the, m7, naas, bypass, did, not, open, until, 1983, the, first, section, of, the, m50, opened, in, 1990, a, part, of, which, was, ireland, s, first, toll, motorway, the, west, link, however, it, would, be, the, 1990s, before, substantial, sections, of, motorway, were, opened, in, ireland, with, the, first, completed, motorway, the, 83, kilometre, 52, mi, m1, motorway, being, finished, in, 2005, under, the, transport, 21, infrastructural, plan, motorways, or, high, quality, dual, carriageways, were, built, between, dublin, and, the, major, cities, of, cork, galway, limerick, and, waterford, by, the, end, of, 2010, other, shorter, sections, of, motorway, either, have, been, or, will, be, built, on, some, other, main, routes, in, 2007, legislation, the, roads, bill, 2007, was, created, to, allow, existing, roads, be, designated, motorways, by, order, because, previously, legislation, allowed, only, for, newly, built, roads, to, be, designated, motorways, as, a, result, most, hqdcs, nationwide, other, than, some, sections, near, dublin, on, the, n4, and, n7, which, did, not, fully, meet, motorway, standards, were, reclassified, as, motorways, the, first, stage, in, this, process, occurred, when, all, the, hqdc, schemes, open, or, under, construction, on, the, n7, and, n8, and, between, kinnegad, and, athlone, on, the, n6, and, kilcullen, and, south, of, carlow, on, the, n9, were, reclassified, motorway, on, 24, september, 2008, further, sections, of, dual, carriageway, were, reclassified, in, 2009, as, of, december, 2011, the, republic, of, ireland, has, around, 1, 017, km, 632, mi, of, motorways, the, world, s, first, motorway, was, the, autostrada, dei, laghi, inaugurated, on, 21, september, 1924, in, italy, it, linked, milan, to, varese, it, was, then, extended, to, como, near, the, border, with, switzerland, inaugurated, on, 28, june, 1925, piero, puricelli, the, engineer, who, designed, this, new, type, of, road, decided, to, cover, the, expenses, by, introducing, a, toll, other, motorways, or, autostrade, built, before, world, war, ii, in, italy, were, naples, pompeii, florence, pisa, padua, venice, milan, turin, milan, bergamo, brescia, and, rome, ostia, the, total, length, of, the, italian, motorway, system, is, about, 7, 016, kilometres, 4, 360, mi, as, of, 30, july, 2022, to, these, data, are, added, 13, motorway, spur, routes, which, extend, for, 355, kilometres, 221, mi, the, density, is, 22, 4, kilometres, 13, 9, mi, of, motorway, for, every, 1,

exactly, the, same, as, motorways, or, autostrade, the, signage, at, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, the, strade, extraurbane, principali, is, the, same, except, the, background, colour, is, blue, instead, of, green, the, general, speed, limit, on, strade, extraurbane, principali, is, 110, km, h, 70, mph, unless, otherwise, indicated, strade, extraurbane, principali, are, not, tolled, there, are, two, categories, of, controlled, access, highways, in, lithuania, expressways, lithuanian, greitkeliai, with, maximum, speed, 120, km, h, 75, mph, and, motorways, lithuanian, automagistral, s, with, maximum, speed, 130, km, h, 81, mph, the, first, section, vilnius, kaunas, of, a1, highway, was, completed, in, 1970, kaunas, klaip, da, section, of, a1, was, completed, in, 1987, vilnius, panev, ys, a2, highway, was, completed, in, stages, during, the, 1980s, and, finished, in, the, 1990s, complete, length, of, the, motorway, network, is, 310, km, 190, mi, expressway, network, length, 80, km, 50, mi, motorway, section, between, kaunas, and, the, polish, border, is, planned, to, be, completed, in, the, 2020s, roads, in, the, netherlands, include, at, least, 2, 758, km, 1, 714, mi, of, motorways, and, expressways, and, with, a, motorway, density, of, 64, kilometres, per, 1, 000, km, 2, 103, mi, 1, 000, mi, 2, the, country, has, one, of, the, densest, motorway, networks, in, the, world, about, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, are, fully, constructed, to, motorway, standards, these, are, called, autosnelweg, or, simply, snelweg, and, numbered, and, signposted, with, an, a, and, up, to, three, digits, like, a12, they, are, consistently, built, with, at, least, two, carriageways, guard, rails, and, interchanges, with, grade, separation, since, september, 2012, the, nationwide, maximum, speed, has, been, raised, to, 130, km, h, 81, mph, but, on, many, stretches, speed, is, still, limited, to, 120, or, 100, km, h, 75, or, 62, mph, dutch, motorways, may, only, be, used, by, motor, vehicles, both, capable, and, legally, allowed, to, go, at, least, 60, km, h, 37, mph, in, march, 2020, the, general, speed, limit, on, dutch, motorways, was, lowered, to, 100, km, h, 62, mph, during, the, day, 6, am, until, 7, pm, at, night, the, maximum, speed, is, different, per, stretch, but, 130, km, h, 81, mph, remained, the, upper, limit, dutch, roads, are, used, with, a, very, high, intensity, in, relation, to, the, network, length, and, traffic, congestion, is, common, due, to, the, country, s, high, population, density, therefore, since, 1979, large, portions, of, the, motorway, network, have, been, equipped, with, variable, message, signs, and, dynamic, electronic, displays, both, of, which, are, aspects, of, intelligent, transportation, systems, these, signs, can, show, a, lower, speed, limit, as, low, as, 50, km, h, 31, mph, to, optimize, the, flow, of, heavy, traffic, and, a, variety, of, other, communications, additionally, there, are, peak, rushhour, or, plus, lanes, which, allow, motorists, to, use, the, hard, shoulder, as, an, extra, traffic, lane, in, case, of, congestion, these, extra, lanes, are, observed, by, cctv, cameras, from, a, traffic, control, center, less, common, but, increasingly, separate, roadways, are, created, for, local, regional, traffic, and, long, distance, traffic, this, way, the, number, of, weaving, motions, across, lanes, is, reduced, and, the, traffic, capacity, per, lane, of, the, road, is, optimised, a, special, feature, of, dutch, motorways, is, the, use, of, porous, asphalt, concrete, which, allows, water, to, drain, efficiently, and, even, in, heavy, rain, no, water, will, splash, up, in, contrast, to, concrete, or, other, road, surfaces, the, netherlands, is, the, only, country, that, uses, pac, this, extensively, and, the, goal, is, to, cover, 100, of, the, motorways, with, pac, in, spite, of, the, high, costs, of, construction, and, maintenance, all, in, all, the, netherlands, has, one, of, the, more, advanced, motorway, networks, in, the, world, the, total, motorway, network, length, in, north, macedonia, is, 317, km, 197, mi, as, of, spring, 2019, another, 70, km, 43, mi, are, under, construction, 57, km, 35, mi, ohrid, to, kicevo, and, 13, km, 8, 1, mi, skopje, to, kosovo, border, the, stretch, from, gostivar, to, kicevo, is, planned, to, start, with, construction, in, 2021, the, three, motorway, routes, are, a1, which, is, part, of, the, european, corridor, e, 75, a2, part, of, e, 65, and, the, recently, built, a4, corridor, that, connects, skopje, to, stip, a1, connects, the, northern, border, serbia, with, the, southern, one, greece, while, a2, traverses, the, country, from, the, east, bulgaria, border, to, west, albania, border, but, only, the, stretch, from, kumanovo, to, gostivar, is, a, divided, motorway, while, the, rest, of, the, length, is, either, an, undivided, two, way, road, or, in, the, process, of, turning, into, a, motorway, norway, has, 2022, 770, km, 480, mi, of, motorways, in, addition, to, 498, km, 309, mi, of, limited, access, roads, in, norwegian, motortrafikkvei, where, pedestrians, bicycles, etc, are, forbidden, though, with, a, bit, lower, standard, than, true, motorway, most, of, the, network, serves, the, big, cities, chiefly, oslo, stavanger, and, bergen, northernmost, motorway, is, as, of, 2022, on, e6, just, south, of, trondheim, see, also, the, e6, e18, and, the, e39, most, motorways, use, four, ramp, dumbbell, interchanges, but, also, roundabout, interchanges, can, be, found, the, first, motorway, was, built, in, 1964, just, outside, oslo, the, motorways, road, pattern, layout, is, similar, to, those, in, the, united, states, and, canada, featuring, a, yellow, stripe, towards, the, median, and, white, stripes, between, the, lanes, and, on, the, edge, the, speed, limits, are, 90, 110, km, h, 56, 68, mph, the, highways, in, poland, are, divided, into, motorways, and, expressways, both, types, featuring, grade, separated, interchanges, with, all, other, roads, emergency, lanes, feeder, lanes, wildlife, protection, measures, and, dedicated, roadside, rest, areas, motorways, can, be, only, dual, carriageways, while, expressways, can, be, dual, or, rarely, single, carriageways, the, start, of, an, expressway, in, poland, is, marked, with, a, sign, of, white, car, on, blue, background, while, number, sign, for, an, expressway, is, of, red, background, and, white, letters, with, the, letter, s, preceding, a, number, speed, limits, in, poland, are, 140, km, h, 87, mph, on, motorways, and, 120, km, h, 75, mph, on, dual, carriageway, expressways, the, regulation, of, the, council, of, ministers, defines, the, network, of, motorways, and, expressways, in, poland, totalling, about, 7, 980, km, 4, 960, mi, including, about, 2, 100, km, 1, 300, mi, of, motorways, as, of, july, 2022, there, are, 4, 688, km, 2, 913, mi, of, motorways, and, expressways, in, operation, 58, of, the, intended, network, while, contracts, for, construction, of, further, 1, 170, km, 727, mi, of, motorways, and, expressways, 15, of, the, intended, network, are, ongoing, portugal, was, the, third, country, in, europe, after, italy, and, germany, to, build, a, motorway, portuguese, autoestrada, plural, autoestradas, opening, in, 1944, the, lisbon, est, dio, nacional, section, of, the, present, a5, autoestrada, da, costa, do, estoril, additional, motorway, sections, were, built, in, the, 1960s, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, however, the, large, scale, building, of, motorways, started, only, in, the, late, 1980s, currently, portugal, has, a, very, well, developed, network, of, motorways, with, about, a, 3, 000, kilometre, 1, 900, mi, extension, that, connects, all, the, highly, populated, coastal, regions, of, the, country, and, the, main, cities, of, the, less, populous, interior, this, means, that, 87, of, the, portuguese, population, lives, at, less, than, 15, minutes, driving, time, from, a, motorway, access, unlike, the, neighbouring, spanish, network, most, of, portuguese, motorways, are, tolled, although, there, are, also, some, non, tolled, highways, mostly, in, urban, areas, like, those, of, greater, lisbon, and, greater, oporto, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, the, government, of, portugal, created, seven, shadow, toll, concessions, the, scut, toll, sem, custos, para, o, utilizador, no, costs, for, the, user, in, those, concessions, it, were, included, more, than, 900, km, 560, mi, of, motorways, and, highways, some, of, them, already, built, others, which, were, built, in, the, following, years, however, due, to, economical, and, political, reasons, the, shadow, toll, concept, was, abolished, between, 2010, and, 2011, with, electronic, toll, equipment, being, installed, in, these, motorways, to, charge, their, users, having, only, electronic, tolls, former, scut, motorways, can, now, only, be, used, by, vehicles, equipped, with, electronic, payment, devices, or, vehicles, registered, in, the, system, portuguese, motorways, form, an, independent, network, rede, nacional, de, autoestradas, national, motorway, network, that, overlaps, with, the, fundamental, and, complementary, subnetworks, of, the, national, highway, network, rede, rodovi, ria, nacional, each, motorway, section, overlapping, with, the, fundamental, subnetwork, is, part, of, an, ip, itiner, rio, principal, principal, route, and, each, motorway, section, overlapping, with, the, complementary, subnetwork, is, part, of, an, ic, itiner, rio, complementar, complementary, route, thus, a, motorway, can, overlap, with, sections, of, different, ip, or, ic, routes, and, on, the, other, hand, an, ip, or, ic, route, can, overlap, with, sections, of, different, motorways, an, example, is, a22, motorway, which, overlaps, with, sections, of, ip1, and, of, ic4, routes, another, example, is, ip1, route, which, overlaps, with, sections, of, the, a22, a2, a12, a1, and, a3, motorways, the, national, motorway, network, has, a, proper, numbering, system, in, which, each, motorway, has, a, number, prefixed, by, the, letter, a, in, most, cases, a, motorway, signage, indicates, only, its, a, number, the, number, of, the, ip, or, ic, of, which, a, motorway, section, is, a, part, is, not, signed, except, in, some, short, motorways, which, lack, a, proper, a, number, as, of, 31, july, 2024, romania, has, 1, 115, km, 693, mi, of, highways, in, use, with, more, under, construction, the, first, motorway, in, romania, was, completed, in, 1972, linking, bucharest, and, pite, ti, the, romanian, government, has, adopted, a, general, master, plan, for, transport, that, was, approved, by, the, european, union, in, july, 2015, containing, the, strategy, for, expanding, the, road, including, motorway, network, until, 2040, using, eu, funding, in, 2024, russia, will, have, a, nationwide, motorway, network, with, a, length, of, 1701, km, and, expressway, network, of, 1826, 4, km, the, motorways, and, expressways, have, the, numbering, of, the, russian, federal, highway, network, or, their, own, name, as, there, is, no, separate, numbering, system, for, motorways, and, expressways, and, their, sections, are, mostly, part, of, the, russian, federal, highway, network, the, legal, speed, limit, on, motorways, and, expressways, is, 110, km, h, and, 130, km, h, on, some, newly, upgraded, sections, of, motorway, sections, of, russian, federal, highway, that, have, been, upgraded, to, motorway, status, are, marked, with, green, signs, federal, highway, roads, that, have, been, upgraded, to, expressways, or, dual, and, single, carriageway, with, road, junction, are, marked, with, blue, signs, in, the, classification, of, russian, federal, highway, roads, motorways, are, assigned, to, technical, category, ia, and, expressways, to, technical, category, ib, motorways, serbian, romanized, autoput, and, expressways, serbian, romanized, brzi, put, are, the, backbone, of, the, road, system, in, serbia, there, are, around, 906, km, 563, mi, of, motorways, in, total, plan, is, 1, 200, km, 750, mi, by, the, end, of, 2018, motorways, in, serbia, have, three, lanes, including, emergency, lane, in, each, direction, signs, are, white, on, green, as, in, the, rest, of, former, yugoslavia, and, the, normal, speed, limit, is, 130, km, h, 81, mph, expressways, unlike, motorways, do, not, have, emergency, lanes, signs, are, white, on, blue, and, the, normal, speed, limit, is, 100, km, h, 62, mph, as, the, serbian, word, for, motorway, is, autoput, the, a1, a2, or, a3, road, designations, are, used, since, november, 2013, all, state, roads, categorized, as, class, i, that, are, motorways, currently, of, in, the, future, are, marked, with, one, digit, numbers, and, known, as, class, ia, all, other, roads, which, belong, to, class, i, are, marked, with, two, digit, numbers, and, known, as, class, ib, expressways, belong, to, class, ib, too, e, numeration, is, also, widely, used, on, motorways, the, core, of, the, motorways, is, what, was, once, called, during, yugoslav, period, the, brotherhood, and, unity, highway, which, was, opened, in, 1950, and, goes, from, the, border, with, croatia, through, belgrade, central, serbia, ni, and, to, border, with, north, macedonia, it, was, one, of, the, first, modern, highways, in, central, eastern, europe, it, is, the, most, direct, link, between, central, and, western, europe, with, greece, and, turkey, and, subsequently, the, middle, east, slovakia, has, currently, 2022, 854, km, 531, mi, of, motorways, slovak, dia, nica, d, and, expressways, r, chlostn, cesta, r, whose, speed, limit, is, 130, km, h, 81, mph, they, are, split, into, expressways, and, motorways, like, poland, with, expressways, starting, with, a, r, short, for, r, chlostn, cesta, but, from, april, 2020, all, the, expressways, in, slovakia, were, known, as, motorways, due, to, that, the, expressways, are, very, similar, to, the, motorways, in, slovakia, you, also, pay, a, e, vignette, to, use, the, motorways, in, slovakia, before, you, used, to, pay, a, sticker, vignette, but, from, 2016, you, pay, electronically, through, the, website, the, highways, in, slovenia, are, the, central, state, roads, in, slovenia, and, are, divided, into, motorways, slovene, avtocesta, ac, and, expressways, hitra, cesta, hc, motorways, are, dual, carriageways, with, a, speed, limit, of, 130, km, h, 81, mph, they, have, white, on, green, road, signs, as, in, italy, croatia, and, other, countries, nearby, expressways, are, secondary, roads, also, dual, carriageways, but, without, an, emergency, lane, they, have, a, speed, limit, of, 110, km, h, 68, mph, and, have, white, on, blue, road, signs, the, spanish, network, of, autopistas, and, autovias, has, a, length, of, 17, 228, km, 10, 705, mi, making, it, the, largest, in, europe, and, the, third, in, the, world, autopistas, are, specifically, reserved, for, automobile, travel, so, all, vehicles, not, able, to, sustain, at, least, 60, km, h, 37, mph, are, banned, from, them, general, speed, limits, are, mandated, by, the, spanish, traffic, law, as, 60, 120, km, h, 37, 75, mph, specific, limits, may, be, imposed, based, on, road, meteorological, or, traffic, conditions, spanish, legislation, requires, an, alternate, route, to, be, provided, for, slower, vehicles, many, but, not, all, autopistas, are, toll, roads, which, also, mandates, an, alternate, toll, free, route, under, the, spanish, laws, sweden, has, the, largest, motorway, network, in, scandinavia, 2, 050, kilometres, 1, 274, mi, it, is, however, unevenly, allocated, most, motorways, are, located, in, the, south, of, the, country, where, the, population, density, is, the, highest, the, first, motorway, in, sweden, opened, in, 1953, between, lund, and, malm, four, lane, expressways, had, been, built, before, an, early, example, is, e20, between, gothenburg, and, alings, s, built, in, the, early, 1940s, most, of, the, current, network, was, built, in, the, 1970s, and, 1990s, e6, starts, i, trelleborg, in, southern, sweden, it, then, continues, along, the, swedish, western, coast, up, to, the, svinesund, bridge, which, is, where, sweden, borders, to, norway, its, length, is, close, to, 600, km, 370, mi, on, swedish, territory, alone, and, it, connects, four, of, scandinavia, s, six, largest, cities, copenhagen, malm, gothenburg, and, oslo, together, as, well, as, around, 20, other, more, or, less, notable, towns, and, cities, a, swedish, partly, motorway, route, rather, than, road, that, also, has, a, significant, portion, of, the, swedish, motorway, network, is, european, route, e4, which, runs, from, the, border, city, of, tornio, in, northern, finland, to, helsingborg, in, southern, sweden, e4, is, the, main, route, that, connects, the, capital, stockholm, with, scania, all, of, e4, south, of, the, city, g, vle, is, of, motorway, standard, with, only, the, part, passing, ljungby, 32, kilometres, 20, mi, left, currently, in, expressway, standard, upgrade, to, motorway, standard, will, start, in, 2017, the, part, of, e4, that, runs, through, western, stockholm, is, called, essingeleden, and, is, the, busiest, road, in, sweden, other, highways, that, have, a, significant, portion, of, motorway, standard, are, e20, e18, and, e22, motorways, in, sweden, are, however, not, restricted, to, european, routes, so, called, riksv, gar, and, other, regional, road, types, can, also, be, of, motorway, standard, an, example, of, this, is, riksv, g, 40, riksv, g, 40, is, the, main, link, between, the, largest, cities, in, the, country, stockholm, and, gothenburg, notably, not, even, the, majority, of, the, european, route, network, in, sweden, is, motorway, or, even, have, expressway, standard, all, of, this, is, because, road, numbering, and, road, standard, is, separate, in, sweden, as, in, the, rest, of, scandinavia, switzerland, has, a, two, class, highway, system, motorways, with, separated, roads, for, oncoming, traffic, and, a, standard, maximal, speed, limit, of, 120, km, h, 75, mph, and, expressways, often, with, oncoming, traffic, and, a, standard, maximal, speed, limit, of, 100, km, h, 62, mph, in, switzerland, as, of, april, 2011, there, were, 1, 763, 6, kilometres, 1, 095, 9, mi,

classes, of, vehicle, the, special, roads, act, 1949, was, passed, the, first, section, of, motorway, the, m6, preston, bypass, opened, in, 1958, followed, by, the, first, major, section, of, motorway, the, m1, between, crick, and, berrygrove, in, watford, which, opened, in, 1959, from, then, until, the, 1980s, motorways, opened, at, frequent, intervals, by, 1972, the, first, 1, 600, km, 1, 000, mi, of, motorway, had, been, built, whilst, roads, outside, of, urban, areas, continued, to, be, built, throughout, the, 1970s, opposition, to, urban, routes, became, more, pronounced, most, notably, plans, by, the, greater, london, council, for, a, series, of, ringways, were, cancelled, following, extensive, road, protests, and, a, rise, in, costs, in, 1986, the, single, ring, m25, motorway, was, completed, as, a, compromise, in, 1996, the, total, length, of, motorways, reached, 3, 200, kilometres, 2, 000, mi, motorways, in, great, britain, as, in, numerous, european, countries, will, nearly, always, have, the, following, characteristics, on, motorways, in, great, britain, there, were, 99, fatalities, in, 2017, for, 69, billion, vehicle, miles, travelled, a, reduction, from, 183, fatalities, in, 2007, which, is, equivalent, to, 1, 43, fatalities, per, billion, vehicle, miles, traveled, legal, authority, existed, in, the, special, roads, act, northern, ireland, 1963, similar, to, that, in, the, 1949, act, the, first, motorway, to, open, was, the, m1, motorway, though, it, did, so, under, temporary, powers, until, the, special, roads, act, had, been, passed, work, on, the, motorways, continued, until, the, 1970s, when, the, oil, crisis, and, the, troubles, both, intervened, causing, the, abandonment, of, many, schemes, australia, s, major, cities, sydney,
