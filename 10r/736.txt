cable, transport, is, a, broad, class, of, transport, modes, that, have, cables, they, transport, passengers, and, goods, often, in, vehicles, called, cable, cars, the, cable, may, be, driven, or, passive, and, items, may, be, moved, by, pulling, sliding, sailing, or, by, drives, within, the, object, being, moved, on, cableways, the, use, of, pulleys, and, balancing, of, loads, moving, up, and, down, are, common, elements, of, cable, transport, they, are, often, used, in, mountainous, areas, where, cable, haulage, can, overcome, large, differences, in, elevation, forms, of, cable, transport, in, which, one, or, more, cables, are, strung, between, supports, of, various, forms, and, cars, are, suspended, from, these, cables, forms, of, cable, transport, where, cars, on, rails, are, hauled, by, cables, the, rails, are, usually, steeply, inclined, and, usually, at, ground, level, other, forms, of, cable, hauled, transport, rope, drawn, transport, dates, back, to, 250, bc, as, evidenced, by, illustrations, of, aerial, ropeway, transportation, systems, in, south, china, the, first, recorded, mechanical, ropeway, was, by, venetian, fausto, veranzio, who, designed, a, bi, cable, passenger, ropeway, in, 1616, the, industry, generally, considers, dutchman, adam, wybe, to, have, built, the, first, operational, system, in, 1644, the, technology, which, was, further, developed, by, the, people, living, in, the, alpine, regions, of, europe, progressed, and, expanded, with, the, advent, of, wire, rope, and, electric, drive, the, first, use, of, wire, rope, for, aerial, tramways, is, disputed, american, inventor, peter, cooper, is, one, early, claimant, constructing, an, aerial, tramway, using, wire, rope, in, baltimore, 1832, to, move, landfill, materials, though, there, is, only, partial, evidence, for, the, claimed, 1832, tramway, cooper, was, involved, in, many, of, such, tramways, built, in, the, 1850s, and, in, 1853, he, built, a, two, mile, long, tramway, to, transport, iron, ore, to, his, blast, furnaces, at, ringwood, new, jersey, world, war, i, motivated, extensive, use, of, military, tramways, for, warfare, between, italy, and, austria, during, the, industrial, revolution, new, forms, of, cable, hauled, transportation, systems, were, created, including, the, use, of, steel, cable, to, allow, for, greater, load, support, and, larger, systems, aerial, tramways, were, first, used, for, commercial, passenger, haulage, in, the, 1900s, the, earliest, form, of, cable, railway, was, the, gravity, incline, which, in, its, simplest, form, consists, of, two, parallel, tracks, laid, on, a, steep, gradient, with, a, single, rope, wound, around, a, winding, drum, and, connecting, the, trains, of, wagons, on, the, tracks, loaded, wagons, at, the, top, of, the, incline, are, lowered, down, their, weight, hauling, empty, wagons, from, the, bottom, the, winding, drum, has, a, brake, to, control, the, rate, of, travel, of, the, wagons, the, first, use, of, a, gravity, incline, isn, t, recorded, but, the, llandegai, tramway, at, bangor, in, north, wales, was, opened, in, 1798, and, is, one, of, the, earliest, examples, using, iron, rails, the, first, cable, hauled, street, railway, was, the, london, and, blackwall, railway, built, in, 1840, which, used, fibre, to, grip, the, haulage, rope, this, caused, a, series, of, technical, and, safety, issues, which, led, to, the, adoption, of, steam, locomotives, by, 1848, the, first, funicular, railway, was, opened, in, lyon, in, 1862, the, westside, and, yonkers, patent, railway, company, developed, a, cable, hauled, elevated, railway, this, 3, mile, long, line, was, proposed, in, 1866, and, opened, in, 1868, it, operated, as, a, cable, railway, until, 1871, when, it, was, converted, to, use, steam, locomotives, the, next, development, of, the, cable, car, came, in, california, andrew, hallidie, a, scottish, emigre, gave, san, francisco, the, first, effective, and, commercially, successful, route, using, steel, cables, opening, the, clay, street, hill, railroad, on, august, 2, 1873, hallidie, was, a, manufacturer, of, steel, cables, the, system, featured, a, human, operated, grip, which, was, able, to, start, and, stop, the, car, safely, the, rope, that, was, used, allowed, the, multiple, independent, cars, to, run, on, one, line, and, soon, hallidie, s, concept, was, extended, to, multiple, lines, in, san, francisco, the, first, cable, railway, outside, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, was, the, roslyn, tramway, which, opened, in, 1881, in, dunedin, new, zealand, america, remained, the, country, that, made, the, greatest, use, of, cable, railways, by, 1890, more, than, 500, miles, of, cable, hauled, track, had, been, laid, carrying, over, 1, 000, 000, passengers, per, year, however, in, 1890, electric, tramways, exceeded, the, cable, hauled, tramways, in, mileage, efficiency, and, speed, the, first, surface, lift, was, built, in, 1908, by, german, robert, winterhalder, in, schollach, eisenbach, hochschwarzwald, and, started, operations, february, 14, 1908, a, steam, powered, toboggan, tow, 950, feet, 290, m, in, length, was, built, in, truckee, california, in, 1910, the, first, skier, specific, tow, in, north, america, was, apparently, installed, in, 1933, by, alec, foster, at, shawbridge, in, the, laurentians, outside, montreal, quebec, the, modern, j, bar, and, t, bar, mechanism, was, invented, in, 1934, by, the, swiss, engineer, ernst, constam, with, the, first, lift, installed, in, davos, switzerland, the, first, chairlift, was, developed, by, james, curran, in, 1936, the, co, owner, of, the, union, pacific, railroad, william, averell, harriman, owned, america, s, first, ski, resort, sun, valley, idaho, he, asked, his, design, office, to, tackle, the, problem, of, lifting, skiers, to, the, top, of, the, resort, curran, a, union, pacific, bridge, designer, adapted, a, cable, hoist, he, had, designed, for, loading, bananas, in, honduras, to, create, the, first, ski, lift, more, recent, developments, are, being, classified, under, the, type, of, track, that, their, design, is, based, upon, after, the, success, of, this, operation, several, other, projects, were, initiated, in, new, zealand, and, chicago, the, social, climate, around, pollution, is, allowing, for, a, shift, from, cars, back, to, the, utilization, of, cable, transport, due, to, their, advantages, however, for, many, years, they, were, a, niche, form, of, transportation, used, primarily, in, difficult, to, operate, conditions, for, cars, such, as, on, ski, slopes, as, lifts, now, that, cable, transport, projects, are, on, the, increase, the, social, effects, are, beginning, to, become, more, significant, in, 2018, the, highest, 3s, cablecar, has, been, inaugurated, in, zermatt, switzerland, after, more, than, two, years, of, construction, this, cablecar, is, also, called, the, matterhorn, glacier, ride, and, it, allows, passengers, to, reach, the, top, of, the, klein, matterhorn, mountain, 3883m, when, compared, to, trains, and, cars, the, volume, of, people, to, transport, over, time, and, the, start, up, cost, of, the, project, must, be, a, consideration, in, areas, with, extensive, road, networks, personal, vehicles, offer, greater, flexibility, and, range, remote, places, like, mountainous, regions, and, ski, slopes, may, be, difficult, to, link, with, roads, making, cable, transport, project, a, much, easier, approach, a, cable, transport, project, system, may, also, need, fewer, invasive, changes, to, the, local, environment, the, use, of, cable, transport, is, not, limited, to, such, rural, locations, as, skiing, resorts, it, can, be, used, in, urban, development, areas, their, uses, in, urban, areas, include, funicular, railways, gondola, lifts, and, aerial, tramways
