the, screw, is, a, mechanism, that, converts, rotational, motion, to, linear, motion, and, a, torque, rotational, force, to, a, linear, force, it, is, one, of, the, six, classical, simple, machines, the, most, common, form, consists, of, a, cylindrical, shaft, with, helical, grooves, or, ridges, called, threads, around, the, outside, the, screw, passes, through, a, hole, in, another, object, or, medium, with, threads, on, the, inside, of, the, hole, that, mesh, with, the, screw, s, threads, when, the, shaft, of, the, screw, is, rotated, relative, to, the, stationary, threads, the, screw, moves, along, its, axis, relative, to, the, medium, surrounding, it, for, example, rotating, a, wood, screw, forces, it, into, wood, in, screw, mechanisms, either, the, screw, shaft, can, rotate, through, a, threaded, hole, in, a, stationary, object, or, a, threaded, collar, such, as, a, nut, can, rotate, around, a, stationary, screw, shaft, geometrically, a, screw, can, be, viewed, as, a, narrow, inclined, plane, wrapped, around, a, cylinder, like, the, other, simple, machines, a, screw, can, amplify, force, a, small, rotational, force, torque, on, the, shaft, can, exert, a, large, axial, force, on, a, load, the, smaller, the, pitch, the, distance, between, the, screw, s, threads, the, greater, the, mechanical, advantage, the, ratio, of, output, to, input, force, screws, are, widely, used, in, threaded, fasteners, to, hold, objects, together, and, in, devices, such, as, screw, tops, for, containers, vises, screw, jacks, and, screw, presses, other, mechanisms, that, use, the, same, principle, also, called, screws, do, not, necessarily, have, a, shaft, or, threads, for, example, a, corkscrew, is, a, helix, shaped, rod, with, a, sharp, point, and, an, archimedes, screw, is, a, water, pump, that, uses, a, rotating, helical, chamber, to, move, water, uphill, the, common, principle, of, all, screws, is, that, a, rotating, helix, can, cause, linear, motion, the, screw, was, one, of, the, last, of, the, simple, machines, to, be, invented, it, first, appeared, in, mesopotamia, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, 911, 609, bc, and, then, later, appeared, in, ancient, egypt, and, ancient, greece, records, indicate, that, the, water, screw, or, screw, pump, was, first, used, in, ancient, egypt, some, time, before, the, greek, philosopher, archimedes, described, the, archimedes, screw, water, pump, around, 234, bc, archimedes, wrote, the, earliest, theoretical, study, of, the, screw, as, a, machine, and, is, considered, to, have, introduced, the, screw, in, ancient, greece, by, the, first, century, bc, the, screw, was, used, in, the, form, of, the, screw, press, and, the, archimedes, screw, greek, philosophers, defined, the, screw, as, one, of, the, simple, machines, and, could, calculate, its, ideal, mechanical, advantage, for, example, heron, of, alexandria, 52, ad, listed, the, screw, as, one, of, the, five, mechanisms, that, could, set, a, load, in, motion, defined, it, as, an, inclined, plane, wrapped, around, a, cylinder, and, described, its, fabrication, and, uses, including, describing, a, tap, for, cutting, female, screw, threads, because, their, complicated, helical, shape, had, to, be, laboriously, cut, by, hand, screws, were, only, used, as, linkages, in, a, few, machines, in, the, ancient, world, screw, fasteners, only, began, to, be, used, in, the, 15th, century, in, clocks, after, screw, cutting, lathes, were, developed, the, screw, was, also, apparently, applied, to, drilling, and, moving, materials, besides, water, around, this, time, when, images, of, augers, and, drills, began, to, appear, in, european, paintings, the, complete, dynamic, theory, of, simple, machines, including, the, screw, was, worked, out, by, italian, scientist, galileo, galilei, in, 1600, in, le, meccaniche, on, mechanics, 163, the, fineness, or, coarseness, of, a, screw, s, threads, are, defined, by, two, closely, related, quantities, in, most, screws, called, single, start, screws, which, have, a, single, helical, thread, wrapped, around, them, the, lead, and, pitch, are, equal, they, only, differ, in, multiple, start, screws, which, have, several, intertwined, threads, in, these, screws, the, lead, is, equal, to, the, pitch, multiplied, by, the, number, of, starts, multiple, start, screws, are, used, when, a, large, linear, motion, for, a, given, rotation, is, desired, for, example, in, screw, caps, on, bottles, and, ball, point, pens, the, helix, of, a, screw, s, thread, can, twist, in, two, possible, directions, which, is, known, as, handedness, most, screw, threads, are, oriented, so, that, when, seen, from, above, the, screw, shaft, moves, away, from, the, viewer, the, screw, is, tightened, when, turned, in, a, clockwise, direction, this, is, known, as, a, right, handed, rh, thread, because, it, follows, the, right, hand, grip, rule, when, the, fingers, of, the, right, hand, are, curled, around, the, shaft, in, the, direction, of, rotation, the, thumb, will, point, in, the, direction, of, motion, of, the, shaft, threads, oriented, in, the, opposite, direction, are, known, as, left, handed, lh, by, common, convention, right, handedness, is, the, default, handedness, for, screw, threads, therefore, most, threaded, parts, and, fasteners, have, right, handed, threads, one, explanation, for, why, right, handed, threads, became, standard, is, that, for, a, right, handed, person, tightening, a, right, handed, screw, with, a, screwdriver, is, easier, than, tightening, a, left, handed, screw, because, it, uses, the, stronger, supinator, muscle, of, the, arm, rather, than, the, weaker, pronator, muscle, since, most, people, are, right, handed, right, handed, threads, became, standard, on, threaded, fasteners, screw, linkages, in, machines, are, exceptions, they, can, be, right, or, left, handed, depending, on, which, is, more, applicable, left, handed, screw, threads, are, also, used, in, some, other, applications, different, shapes, profiles, of, threads, are, used, in, screws, employed, for, different, purposes, screw, threads, are, standardized, so, that, parts, made, by, different, manufacturers, will, mate, correctly, the, thread, angle, is, the, included, angle, measured, at, a, section, parallel, to, the, axis, between, the, two, bearing, faces, of, the, thread, the, angle, between, the, axial, load, force, and, the, normal, to, the, bearing, surface, is, approximately, equal, to, half, the, thread, angle, so, the, thread, angle, has, a, great, effect, on, the, friction, and, efficiency, of, a, screw, as, well, as, the, wear, rate, and, the, strength, the, greater, the, thread, angle, the, greater, the, angle, between, the, load, vector, and, the, surface, normal, so, the, larger, the, normal, force, between, the, threads, required, to, support, a, given, load, therefore, increasing, the, thread, angle, increases, the, friction, and, wear, of, a, screw, the, outward, facing, angled, thread, bearing, surface, when, acted, on, by, the, load, force, also, applies, a, radial, outward, force, to, the, nut, causing, tensile, stress, this, radial, bursting, force, increases, with, increasing, thread, angle, if, the, tensile, strength, of, the, nut, material, is, insufficient, an, excessive, load, on, a, nut, with, a, large, thread, angle, can, split, the, nut, the, thread, angle, also, has, an, effect, on, the, strength, of, the, threads, threads, with, a, large, angle, have, a, wide, root, compared, with, their, size, and, are, stronger, in, threaded, fasteners, large, amounts, of, friction, are, acceptable, and, usually, wanted, to, prevent, the, fastener, from, unscrewing, so, threads, used, in, fasteners, usually, have, a, large, 60, thread, angle, in, machine, linkages, such, as, lead, screws, or, jackscrews, in, contrast, friction, must, be, minimized, therefore, threads, with, smaller, angles, are, used, the, screw, propeller, although, it, shares, the, name, screw, works, on, very, different, physical, principles, from, the, above, types, of, screw, and, the, information, in, this, article, is, not, applicable, to, it, the, linear, distance, d, displaystyle, d, a, screw, shaft, moves, when, it, is, rotated, through, an, angle, of, displaystyle, alpha, degrees, is, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, lead, of, the, screw, the, distance, ratio, of, a, simple, machine, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, distance, the, applied, force, moves, to, the, distance, the, load, moves, for, a, screw, it, is, the, ratio, of, the, circular, distance, d, in, a, point, on, the, edge, of, the, shaft, moves, to, the, linear, distance, d, out, the, shaft, moves, if, r, is, the, radius, of, the, shaft, in, one, turn, a, point, on, the, screw, s, rim, moves, a, distance, of, 2, r, while, its, shaft, moves, linearly, by, the, lead, distance, l, so, the, distance, ratio, is, the, mechanical, advantage, ma, of, a, screw, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, axial, output, force, f, out, applied, by, the, shaft, on, a, load, to, the, rotational, force, f, in, applied, to, the, rim, of, the, shaft, to, turn, it, for, a, screw, with, no, friction, also, called, an, ideal, screw, from, conservation, of, energy, the, work, done, on, the, screw, by, the, input, force, turning, it, is, equal, to, the, work, done, by, the, screw, on, the, load, force, work, is, equal, to, the, force, multiplied, by, the, distance, it, acts, so, the, work, done, in, one, complete, turn, of, the, screw, is, w, i, n, 2, r, f, i, n, displaystyle, w, in, 2, pi, rf, in, and, the, work, done, on, the, load, is, w, o, u, t, l, f, o, u, t, displaystyle, w, out, lf, out, so, the, ideal, mechanical, advantage, of, a, screw, is, equal, to, the, distance, ratio, m, a, i, d, e, a, l, f, o, u, t, f, i, n, 2, r, l, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, ideal, equiv, frac, f, out, f, in, frac, 2, pi, r, l, it, can, be, seen, that, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, screw, depends, on, its, lead, l, displaystyle, l, the, smaller, the, distance, between, its, threads, the, larger, the, mechanical, advantage, and, the, larger, the, force, the, screw, can, exert, for, a, given, applied, force, however, most, actual, screws, have, large, amounts, of, friction, and, their, mechanical, advantage, is, less, than, given, by, the, above, equation, the, rotational, force, applied, to, the, screw, is, actually, a, torque, t, i, n, f, i, n, r, displaystyle, t, in, f, in, r, because, of, this, the, input, force, required, to, turn, a, screw, depends, on, how, far, from, the, shaft, it, is, applied, the, farther, from, the, shaft, the, less, force, is, needed, to, turn, it, the, force, on, a, screw, is, not, usually, applied, at, the, rim, as, assumed, above, it, is, often, applied, by, some, form, of, lever, for, example, a, bolt, is, turned, by, a, wrench, whose, handle, functions, as, a, lever, the, mechanical, advantage, in, this, case, can, be, calculated, by, using, the, length, of, the, lever, arm, for, r, in, the, above, equation, this, extraneous, factor, r, can, be, removed, from, the, above, equation, by, writing, it, in, terms, of, torque, because, of, the, large, area, of, sliding, contact, between, the, moving, and, stationary, threads, screws, typically, have, large, frictional, energy, losses, even, well, lubricated, jack, screws, have, efficiencies, of, only, 15, 20, the, rest, of, the, work, applied, in, turning, them, is, lost, to, friction, when, friction, is, included, the, mechanical, advantage, is, no, longer, equal, to, the, distance, ratio, but, also, depends, on, the, screw, s, efficiency, from, conservation, of, energy, the, work, w, in, done, on, the, screw, by, the, input, force, turning, it, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, work, done, moving, the, load, w, out, and, the, work, dissipated, as, heat, by, friction, w, fric, in, the, screw, the, efficiency, is, a, dimensionless, number, between, 0, and, 1, defined, as, the, ratio, of, output, work, to, input, work, work, is, defined, as, the, force, multiplied, by, the, distance, moved, so, w, i, n, f, i, n, d, i, n, displaystyle, w, in, f, in, d, in, and, w, o, u, t, f, o, u, t, d, o, u, t, displaystyle, w, out, f, out, d, out, and, therefore, m, a, f, o, u, t, f, i, n, 2, r, l, displaystyle, ma, frac, f, out, f, in, eta, frac, 2, pi, r, l, or, in, terms, of, torque, so, the, mechanical, advantage, of, an, actual, screw, is, reduced, from, what, it, would, be, in, an, ideal, frictionless, screw, by, the, efficiency, displaystyle, eta, because, of, their, low, efficiency, in, powered, machinery, screws, are, not, often, used, as, linkages, to, transfer, large, amounts, of, power, but, are, more, often, used, in, positioners, that, operate, intermittently, large, frictional, forces, cause, most, screws, in, practical, use, to, be, self, locking, also, called, non, reciprocal, or, non, overhauling, this, means, that, applying, a, torque, to, the, shaft, will, cause, it, to, turn, but, no, amount, of, axial, load, force, against, the, shaft, will, cause, it, to, turn, back, the, other, way, even, if, the, applied, torque, is, zero, this, is, in, contrast, to, some, other, simple, machines, which, are, reciprocal, or, non, locking, which, means, if, the, load, force, is, great, enough, they, will, move, backwards, or, overhaul, thus, the, machine, can, be, used, in, either, direction, for, example, in, a, lever, if, the, force, on, the, load, end, is, too, large, it, will, move, backwards, doing, work, on, the, applied, force, most, screws, are, designed, to, be, self, locking, and, in, the, absence, of, torque, on, the, shaft, will, stay, at, whatever, position, they, are, left, however, some, screw, mechanisms, with, a, large, enough, pitch, and, good, lubrication, are, not, self, locking, and, will, overhaul, and, a, very, few, such, as, a, push, drill, use, the, screw, in, this, backwards, sense, applying, axial, force, to, the, shaft, to, turn, the, screw, other, reasons, for, the, screws, to, come, loose, are, incorrect, design, of, assembly, and, external, forces, such, as, shock, vibration, and, dynamic, loads, causing, slipping, on, the, threaded, and, mated, clamped, surfaces, this, self, locking, property, is, one, reason, for, the, very, large, use, of, the, screw, in, threaded, fasteners, such, as, wood, screws, sheet, metal, screws, studs, and, bolts, tightening, the, fastener, by, turning, it, puts, compression, force, on, the, materials, or, parts, being, fastened, together, but, no, amount, of, force, from, the, parts, will, cause, the, screw, to, turn, backwards, and, untighten, this, property, is, also, the, basis, for, the, use, of, screws, in, screw, top, container, lids, vises, c, clamps, and, screw, jacks, a, heavy, object, can, be, raised, by, turning, the, jack, shaft, but, when, the, shaft, is, released, it, will, stay, at, whatever, height, it, is, raised, to, a, screw, will, be, self, locking, if, and, only, if, its, efficiency, displaystyle, eta, is, below, 50, whether, a, screw, is, self, locking, ultimately, depends, on, the, pitch, angle, and, the, coefficient, of, friction, of, the, threads, very, well, lubricated, low, friction, threads, with, a, large, enough, pitch, may, overhaul, also, considerations, should, be, made, to, ensure, that, clamped, components, are, clamped, tight, enough, to, prevent, movement, completely, if, not, slipping, in, the, threads, or, clamping, surface, can, occur
