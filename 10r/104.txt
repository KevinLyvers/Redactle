a, search, engine, is, a, software, system, that, provides, hyperlinks, to, web, pages, and, other, relevant, information, on, the, web, in, response, to, a, user, s, query, the, user, inputs, a, query, within, a, web, browser, or, a, mobile, app, and, the, search, results, are, often, a, list, of, hyperlinks, accompanied, by, textual, summaries, and, images, users, also, have, the, option, of, limiting, the, search, to, a, specific, type, of, results, such, as, images, videos, or, news, for, a, search, provider, its, engine, is, part, of, a, distributed, computing, system, that, can, encompass, many, data, centers, throughout, the, world, the, speed, and, accuracy, of, an, engine, s, response, to, a, query, is, based, on, a, complex, system, of, indexing, that, is, continuously, updated, by, automated, web, crawlers, this, can, include, data, mining, the, files, and, databases, stored, on, web, servers, but, some, content, is, not, accessible, to, crawlers, there, have, been, many, search, engines, since, the, dawn, of, the, web, in, the, 1990s, but, google, search, became, the, dominant, one, in, the, 2000s, and, has, remained, so, it, currently, has, a, 91, global, market, share, the, business, of, websites, improving, their, visibility, in, search, results, known, as, marketing, and, optimization, has, thus, largely, focused, on, google, in, 1945, vannevar, bush, described, an, information, retrieval, system, that, would, allow, a, user, to, access, a, great, expanse, of, information, all, at, a, single, desk, he, called, it, a, memex, he, described, the, system, in, an, article, titled, as, we, may, think, that, was, published, in, the, atlantic, monthly, the, memex, was, intended, to, give, a, user, the, capability, to, overcome, the, ever, increasing, difficulty, of, locating, information, in, ever, growing, centralized, indices, of, scientific, work, vannevar, bush, envisioned, libraries, of, research, with, connected, annotations, which, are, similar, to, modern, hyperlinks, link, analysis, eventually, became, a, crucial, component, of, search, engines, through, algorithms, such, as, hyper, search, and, pagerank, the, first, internet, search, engines, predate, the, debut, of, the, web, in, december, 1990, whois, user, search, dates, back, to, 1982, and, the, knowbot, information, service, multi, network, user, search, was, first, implemented, in, 1989, the, first, well, documented, search, engine, that, searched, content, files, namely, ftp, files, was, archie, which, debuted, on, 10, september, 1990, prior, to, september, 1993, the, world, wide, web, was, entirely, indexed, by, hand, there, was, a, list, of, webservers, edited, by, tim, berners, lee, and, hosted, on, the, cern, webserver, one, snapshot, of, the, list, in, 1992, remains, but, as, more, and, more, web, servers, went, online, the, central, list, could, no, longer, keep, up, on, the, ncsa, site, new, servers, were, announced, under, the, title, what, s, new, the, first, tool, used, for, searching, content, as, opposed, to, users, on, the, internet, was, archie, the, name, stands, for, archive, without, the, v, it, was, created, by, alan, emtage, computer, science, student, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, quebec, canada, the, program, downloaded, the, directory, listings, of, all, the, files, located, on, public, anonymous, ftp, file, transfer, protocol, sites, creating, a, searchable, database, of, file, names, however, archie, search, engine, did, not, index, the, contents, of, these, sites, since, the, amount, of, data, was, so, limited, it, could, be, readily, searched, manually, the, rise, of, gopher, created, in, 1991, by, mark, mccahill, at, the, university, of, minnesota, led, to, two, new, search, programs, veronica, and, jughead, like, archie, they, searched, the, file, names, and, titles, stored, in, gopher, index, systems, veronica, very, easy, rodent, oriented, net, wide, index, to, computerized, archives, provided, a, keyword, search, of, most, gopher, menu, titles, in, the, entire, gopher, listings, jughead, jonzy, s, universal, gopher, hierarchy, excavation, and, display, was, a, tool, for, obtaining, menu, information, from, specific, gopher, servers, while, the, name, of, the, search, engine, archie, search, engine, was, not, a, reference, to, the, archie, comic, book, series, veronica, and, jughead, are, characters, in, the, series, thus, referencing, their, predecessor, in, the, summer, of, 1993, no, search, engine, existed, for, the, web, though, numerous, specialized, catalogs, were, maintained, by, hand, oscar, nierstrasz, at, the, university, of, geneva, wrote, a, series, of, perl, scripts, that, periodically, mirrored, these, pages, and, rewrote, them, into, a, standard, format, this, formed, the, basis, for, w3catalog, the, web, s, first, primitive, search, engine, released, on, september, 2, 1993, in, june, 1993, matthew, gray, then, at, mit, produced, what, was, probably, the, first, web, robot, the, perl, based, world, wide, web, wanderer, and, used, it, to, generate, an, index, called, wandex, the, purpose, of, the, wanderer, was, to, measure, the, size, of, the, world, wide, web, which, it, did, until, late, 1995, the, web, s, second, search, engine, aliweb, appeared, in, november, 1993, aliweb, did, not, use, a, web, robot, but, instead, depended, on, being, notified, by, website, administrators, of, the, existence, at, each, site, of, an, index, file, in, a, particular, format, jumpstation, created, in, december, 1993, by, jonathon, fletcher, used, a, web, robot, to, find, web, pages, and, to, build, its, index, and, used, a, web, form, as, the, interface, to, its, query, program, it, was, thus, the, first, www, resource, discovery, tool, to, combine, the, three, essential, features, of, a, web, search, engine, crawling, indexing, and, searching, as, described, below, because, of, the, limited, resources, available, on, the, platform, it, ran, on, its, indexing, and, hence, searching, were, limited, to, the, titles, and, headings, found, in, the, web, pages, the, crawler, encountered, one, of, the, first, all, text, crawler, based, search, engines, was, webcrawler, which, came, out, in, 1994, unlike, its, predecessors, it, allowed, users, to, search, for, any, word, in, any, web, page, which, has, become, the, standard, for, all, major, search, engines, since, it, was, also, the, search, engine, that, was, widely, known, by, the, public, also, in, 1994, lycos, which, started, at, carnegie, mellon, university, was, launched, and, became, a, major, commercial, endeavor, the, first, popular, search, engine, on, the, web, was, yahoo, search, the, first, product, from, yahoo, founded, by, jerry, yang, and, david, filo, in, january, 1994, was, a, web, directory, called, yahoo, directory, in, 1995, a, search, function, was, added, allowing, users, to, search, yahoo, directory, it, became, one, of, the, most, popular, ways, for, people, to, find, web, pages, of, interest, but, its, search, function, operated, on, its, web, directory, rather, than, its, full, text, copies, of, web, pages, soon, after, a, number, of, search, engines, appeared, and, vied, for, popularity, these, included, magellan, excite, infoseek, inktomi, northern, light, and, altavista, information, seekers, could, also, browse, the, directory, instead, of, doing, a, keyword, based, search, in, 1996, robin, li, developed, the, rankdex, site, scoring, algorithm, for, search, engines, results, page, ranking, and, received, a, us, patent, for, the, technology, it, was, the, first, search, engine, that, used, hyperlinks, to, measure, the, quality, of, websites, it, was, indexing, predating, the, very, similar, algorithm, patent, filed, by, google, two, years, later, in, 1998, larry, page, referenced, li, s, work, in, some, of, his, u, s, patents, for, pagerank, li, later, used, his, rankdex, technology, for, the, baidu, search, engine, which, was, founded, by, him, in, china, and, launched, in, 2000, in, 1996, netscape, was, looking, to, give, a, single, search, engine, an, exclusive, deal, as, the, featured, search, engine, on, netscape, s, web, browser, there, was, so, much, interest, that, instead, netscape, struck, deals, with, five, of, the, major, search, engines, for, 5, million, a, year, each, search, engine, would, be, in, rotation, on, the, netscape, search, engine, page, the, five, engines, were, yahoo, magellan, lycos, infoseek, and, excite, google, adopted, the, idea, of, selling, search, terms, in, 1998, from, a, small, search, engine, company, named, goto, com, this, move, had, a, significant, effect, on, the, search, engine, business, which, went, from, struggling, to, one, of, the, most, profitable, businesses, in, the, internet, search, engines, were, also, known, as, some, of, the, brightest, stars, in, the, internet, investing, frenzy, that, occurred, in, the, late, 1990s, several, companies, entered, the, market, spectacularly, receiving, record, gains, during, their, initial, public, offerings, some, have, taken, down, their, public, search, engine, and, are, marketing, enterprise, only, editions, such, as, northern, light, many, search, engine, companies, were, caught, up, in, the, dot, com, bubble, a, speculation, driven, market, boom, that, peaked, in, march, 2000, around, 2000, google, s, search, engine, rose, to, prominence, the, company, achieved, better, results, for, many, searches, with, an, algorithm, called, pagerank, as, was, explained, in, the, paper, anatomy, of, a, search, engine, written, by, sergey, brin, and, larry, page, the, later, founders, of, google, this, iterative, algorithm, ranks, web, pages, based, on, the, number, and, pagerank, of, other, web, sites, and, pages, that, link, there, on, the, premise, that, good, or, desirable, pages, are, linked, to, more, than, others, larry, page, s, patent, for, pagerank, cites, robin, li, s, earlier, rankdex, patent, as, an, influence, google, also, maintained, a, minimalist, interface, to, its, search, engine, in, contrast, many, of, its, competitors, embedded, a, search, engine, in, a, web, portal, in, fact, the, google, search, engine, became, so, popular, that, spoof, engines, emerged, such, as, mystery, seeker, by, 2000, yahoo, was, providing, search, services, based, on, inktomi, s, search, engine, yahoo, acquired, inktomi, in, 2002, and, overture, which, owned, alltheweb, and, altavista, in, 2003, yahoo, switched, to, google, s, search, engine, until, 2004, when, it, launched, its, own, search, engine, based, on, the, combined, technologies, of, its, acquisitions, microsoft, first, launched, msn, search, in, the, fall, of, 1998, using, search, results, from, inktomi, in, early, 1999, the, site, began, to, display, listings, from, looksmart, blended, with, results, from, inktomi, for, a, short, time, in, 1999, msn, search, used, results, from, altavista, instead, in, 2004, microsoft, began, a, transition, to, its, own, search, technology, powered, by, its, own, web, crawler, called, msnbot, microsoft, s, rebranded, search, engine, bing, was, launched, on, june, 1, 2009, on, july, 29, 2009, yahoo, and, microsoft, finalized, a, deal, in, which, yahoo, search, would, be, powered, by, microsoft, bing, technology, as, of, 2019, active, search, engine, crawlers, include, those, of, google, sogou, baidu, bing, gigablast, mojeek, duckduckgo, and, yandex, a, search, engine, maintains, the, following, processes, in, near, real, time, web, search, engines, get, their, information, by, web, crawling, from, site, to, site, the, spider, checks, for, the, standard, filename, robots, txt, addressed, to, it, the, robots, txt, file, contains, directives, for, search, spiders, telling, it, which, pages, to, crawl, and, which, pages, not, to, crawl, after, checking, for, robots, txt, and, either, finding, it, or, not, the, spider, sends, certain, information, back, to, be, indexed, depending, on, many, factors, such, as, the, titles, page, content, javascript, cascading, style, sheets, css, headings, or, its, metadata, in, html, meta, tags, after, a, certain, number, of, pages, crawled, amount, of, data, indexed, or, time, spent, on, the, website, the, spider, stops, crawling, and, moves, on, o, web, crawler, may, actually, crawl, the, entire, reachable, web, due, to, infinite, websites, spider, traps, spam, and, other, exigencies, of, the, real, web, crawlers, instead, apply, a, crawl, policy, to, determine, when, the, crawling, of, a, site, should, be, deemed, sufficient, some, websites, are, crawled, exhaustively, while, others, are, crawled, only, partially, indexing, means, associating, words, and, other, definable, tokens, found, on, web, pages, to, their, domain, names, and, html, based, fields, the, associations, are, made, in, a, public, database, made, available, for, web, search, queries, a, query, from, a, user, can, be, a, single, word, multiple, words, or, a, sentence, the, index, helps, find, information, relating, to, the, query, as, quickly, as, possible, some, of, the, techniques, for, indexing, and, caching, are, trade, secrets, whereas, web, crawling, is, a, straightforward, process, of, visiting, all, sites, on, a, systematic, basis, between, visits, by, the, spider, the, cached, version, of, the, page, some, or, all, the, content, needed, to, render, it, stored, in, the, search, engine, working, memory, is, quickly, sent, to, an, inquirer, if, a, visit, is, overdue, the, search, engine, can, just, act, as, a, web, proxy, instead, in, this, case, the, page, may, differ, from, the, search, terms, indexed, the, cached, page, holds, the, appearance, of, the, version, whose, words, were, previously, indexed, so, a, cached, version, of, a, page, can, be, useful, to, the, website, when, the, actual, page, has, been, lost, but, this, problem, is, also, considered, a, mild, form, of, linkrot, typically, when, a, user, enters, a, query, into, a, search, engine, it, is, a, few, keywords, the, index, already, has, the, names, of, the, sites, containing, the, keywords, and, these, are, instantly, obtained, from, the, index, the, real, processing, load, is, in, generating, the, web, pages, that, are, the, search, results, list, every, page, in, the, entire, list, must, be, weighted, according, to, information, in, the, indexes, then, the, top, search, result, item, requires, the, lookup, reconstruction, and, markup, of, the, snippets, showing, the, context, of, the, keywords, matched, these, are, only, part, of, the, processing, each, search, results, web, page, requires, and, further, pages, next, to, the, top, require, more, of, this, post, processing, beyond, simple, keyword, lookups, search, engines, offer, their, own, gui, or, command, driven, operators, and, search, parameters, to, refine, the, search, results, these, provide, the, necessary, controls, for, the, user, engaged, in, the, feedback, loop, users, create, by, filtering, and, weighting, while, refining, the, search, results, given, the, initial, pages, of, the, first, search, results, for, example, from, 2007, the, google, com, search, engine, has, allowed, one, to, filter, by, date, by, clicking, show, search, tools, in, the, leftmost, column, of, the, initial, search, results, page, and, then, selecting, the, desired, date, range, it, is, also, possible, to, weight, by, date, because, each, page, has, a, modification, time, most, search, engines, support, the, use, of, the, boolean, operators, and, or, and, not, to, help, end, users, refine, the, search, query, boolean, operators, are, for, literal, searches, that, allow, the, user, to, refine, and, extend, the, terms, of, the, search, the, engine, looks, for, the, words, or, phrases, exactly, as, entered, some, search, engines, provide, an, advanced, feature, called, proximity, search, which, allows, users, to, define, the, distance, between, keywords, there, is, also, concept, based, searching, where, the, research, involves, using, statistical, analysis, on, pages, containing, the, words, or, phrases, you, search, for, the, usefulness, of, a, search, engine, depends, on, the, relevance, of, the, result, set, it, gives, back, while, there, may, be, millions, of, web, pages, that, include, a, particular, word, or, phrase, some, pages, may, be, more, relevant, popular, or, authoritative, than, others, most, search, engines, employ, methods, to, rank, the, results, to, provide, the, best, results, first, how, a, search, engine, decides, which, pages, are, the, best, matches, and, what, order, the, results, should, be, shown, in, varies, widely, from, one, engine, to, another, the, methods, also, change, over, time, as, internet, usage, changes, and, new, techniques, evolve, there, are, two, main, types, of, search, engine, that, have, evolved, one, is, a, system, of, predefined, and, hierarchically, ordered, keywords, that, humans, have, programmed, extensively, the, other, is, a, system, that, generates, an, inverted, index, by, analyzing, texts, it, locates, this, first, form, relies, much, more, heavily, on, the, computer, itself, to, do, the, bulk, of, the, work, most, web, search, engines, are, commercial, ventures, supported, by, advertising, revenue, and, thus, some, of, them, allow, advertisers, to, have, their, listings, ranked, higher, in, search, results, for, a, fee, search, engines, that, do, not, accept, money, for, their, search, results, make, money, by, running, search, related, ads, alongside, the, regular, search, engine, results, the, search, engines, make, money, every, time, someone, clicks, on, one, of, these, ads, local, search, is, the, process, that, optimizes, the, efforts, of, local, businesses, they, focus, on, change, to, make, sure, all, searches, are, consistent, it, is, important, because, many, people, determine, where, they, plan, to, go, and, what, to, buy, based, on, their, searches, as, of, january, 2022, google, is, by, far, the, world, s, most, used, search, engine, with, a, market, share, of, 90, 6, and, the, world, s, other, most, used, search, engines, were, bing, yahoo, baidu, yandex, and, duckduckgo, in, 2024, google, s, dominance, was, ruled, an, illegal, monopoly, in, a, case, brought, by, the, us, department, of, justice, in, russia, yandex, has, a, market, share, of, 62, 6, compared, to, google, s, 28, 3, and, yandex, is, the, second, most, used, search, engine, on, smartphones, in, asia, and, europe, in, china, baidu, is, the, most, popular, search, engine, south, korea, s, homegrown, search, portal, naver, is, used, for, 62, 8, of, online, searches, in, the, country, yahoo, japan, and, yahoo, taiwan, are, the, most, popular, avenues, for, internet, searches, in, japan, and, taiwan, respectively, china, is, one, of, few, countries, where, google, is, not, in, the, top, three, web, search, engines, for, market, share, google, was, previously, a, top, search, engine, in, china, but, withdrew, after, a, disagreement, with, the, government, over, censorship, and, a, cyberattack, but, bing, is, in, top, three, web, search, engine, with, a, market, share, of, 14, 95, baidu, is, on, top, with, 49, 1, market, share, most, countries, markets, in, the, european, union, are, dominated, by, google, except, for, the, czech, republic, where, seznam, is, a, strong, competitor, the, search, engine, qwant, is, based, in, paris, france, where, it, attracts, most, of, its, 50, million, monthly, registered, users, from, although, search, engines, are, programmed, to, rank, websites, based, on, some, combination, of, their, popularity, and, relevancy, empirical, studies, indicate, various, political, economic, and, social, biases, in, the, information, they, provide, and, the, underlying, assumptions, about, the, technology, these, biases, can, be, a, direct, result, of, economic, and, commercial, processes, e, g, companies, that, advertise, with, a, search, engine, can, become, also, more, popular, in, its, organic, search, results, and, political, processes, e, g, the, removal, of, search, results, to, comply, with, local, laws, for, example, google, will, not, surface, certain, neo, nazi, websites, in, france, and, germany, where, holocaust, denial, is, illegal, biases, can, also, be, a, result, of, social, processes, as, search, engine, algorithms, are, frequently, designed, to, exclude, non, normative, viewpoints, in, favor, of, more, popular, results, indexing, algorithms, of, major, search, engines, skew, towards, coverage, of, u, s, based, sites, rather, than, websites, from, non, u, s, countries, google, bombing, is, one, example, of, an, attempt, to, manipulate, search, results, for, political, social, or, commercial, reasons, several, scholars, have, studied, the, cultural, changes, triggered, by, search, engines, and, the, representation, of, certain, controversial, topics, in, their, results, such, as, terrorism, in, ireland, climate, change, denial, and, conspiracy, theories, there, has, been, concern, raised, that, search, engines, such, as, google, and, bing, provide, customized, results, based, on, the, user, s, activity, history, leading, to, what, has, been, termed, echo, chambers, or, filter, bubbles, by, eli, pariser, in, 2011, the, argument, is, that, search, engines, and, social, media, platforms, use, algorithms, to, selectively, guess, what, information, a, user, would, like, to, see, based, on, information, about, the, user, such, as, location, past, click, behaviour, and, search, history, as, a, result, websites, tend, to, show, only, information, that, agrees, with, the, user, s, past, viewpoint, according, to, eli, pariser, users, get, less, exposure, to, conflicting, viewpoints, and, are, isolated, intellectually, in, their, own, informational, bubble, since, this, problem, has, been, identified, competing, search, engines, have, emerged, that, seek, to, avoid, this, problem, by, not, tracking, or, bubbling, users, such, as, duckduckgo, however, many, scholars, have, questioned, pariser, s, view, finding, that, there, is, little, evidence, for, the, filter, bubble, on, the, contrary, a, number, of, studies, trying, to, verify, the, existence, of, filter, bubbles, have, found, only, minor, levels, of, personalisation, in, search, that, most, people, encounter, a, range, of, views, when, browsing, online, and, that, google, news, tends, to, promote, mainstream, established, news, outlets, the, global, growth, of, the, internet, and, electronic, media, in, the, arab, and, muslim, world, during, the, last, decade, has, encouraged, islamic, adherents, in, the, middle, east, and, asian, sub, continent, to, attempt, their, own, search, engines, their, own, filtered, search, portals, that, would, enable, users, to, perform, safe, searches, more, than, usual, safe, search, filters, these, islamic, web, portals, categorizing, websites, into, being, either, halal, or, haram, based, on, interpretation, of, the, law, of, islam, imhalal, came, online, in, september, 2011, halalgoogling, came, online, in, july, 2013, these, use, haram, filters, on, the, collections, from, google, and, bing, and, others, while, lack, of, investment, and, slow, pace, in, technologies, in, the, muslim, world, has, hindered, progress, and, thwarted, success, of, an, islamic, search, engine, targeting, as, the, main, consumers, islamic, adherents, projects, like, muxlim, a, muslim, lifestyle, site, did, receive, millions, of, dollars, from, investors, like, rite, internet, ventures, and, it, also, faltered, other, religion, oriented, search, engines, are, jewogle, the, jewish, version, of, google, and, seekfind, org, which, is, christian, seekfind, filters, sites, that, attack, or, degrade, their, faith, web, search, engine, submission, is, a, process, in, which, a, webmaster, submits, a, website, directly, to, a, search, engine, while, search, engine, submission, is, sometimes, presented, as, a, way, to, promote, a, website, it, generally, is, not, necessary, because, the, major, search, engines, use, web, crawlers, that, will, eventually, find, most, web, sites, on, the, internet, without, assistance, they, can, either, submit, one, web, page, at, a, time, or, they, can, submit, the, entire, site, using, a, sitemap, but, it, is, normally, only, necessary, to, submit, the, home, page, of, a, web, site, as, search, engines, are, able, to, crawl, a, well, designed, website, there, are, two, remaining, reasons, to, submit, a, web, site, or, web, page, to, a, search, engine, to, add, an, entirely, new, web, site, without, waiting, for, a, search, engine, to, discover, it, and, to, have, a, web, site, s, record, updated, after, a, substantial, redesign, some, search, engine, submission, software, not, only, submits, websites, to, multiple, search, engines, but, also, adds, links, to, websites, from, their, own, pages, this, could, appear, helpful, in, increasing, a, website, s, ranking, because, external, links, are, one, of, the, most, important, factors, determining, a, website, s, ranking, however, john, mueller, of, google, has, stated, that, this, can, lead, to, a, tremendous, number, of, unnatural, links, for, your, site, with, a, negative, impact, on, site, ranking, in, comparison, to, search, engines, a, social, bookmarking, system, has, several, advantages, over, traditional, automated, resource, location, and, classification, software, such, as, search, engine, spiders, all, tag, based, classification, of, internet, resources, such, as, web, sites, is, done, by, human, beings, who, understand, the, content, of, the, resource, as, opposed, to, software, which, algorithmically, attempts, to, determine, the, meaning, and, quality, of, a, resource, also, people, can, find, and, bookmark, web, pages, that, have, not, yet, been, noticed, or, indexed, by, web, spiders, additionally, a, social, bookmarking, system, can, rank, a, resource, based, on, how, many, times, it, has, been, bookmarked, by, users, which, may, be, a, more, useful, metric, for, end, users, than, systems, that, rank, resources, based, on, the, number, of, external, links, pointing, to, it, however, both, types, of, ranking, are, vulnerable, to, fraud, see, gaming, the, system, and, both, need, technical, countermeasures, to, try, to, deal, with, this, the, first, web, search, engine, was, archie, created, in, 1990, by, alan, emtage, a, student, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, the, author, originally, wanted, to, call, the, program, archives, but, had, to, shorten, it, to, comply, with, the, unix, world, standard, of, assigning, programs, and, files, short, cryptic, names, such, as, grep, cat, troff, sed, awk, perl, and, so, on, the, primary, method, of, storing, and, retrieving, files, was, via, the, file, transfer, protocol, ftp, this, was, and, still, is, a, system, that, specified, a, common, way, for, computers, to, exchange, files, over, the, internet, it, works, like, this, some, administrator, decides, that, he, wants, to, make, files, available, from, his, computer, he, sets, up, a, program, on, his, computer, called, an, ftp, server, when, someone, on, the, internet, wants, to, retrieve, a, file, from, this, computer, he, or, she, connects, to, it, via, another, program, called, an, ftp, client, any, ftp, client, program, can, connect, with, any, ftp, server, program, as, long, as, the, client, and, server, programs, both, fully, follow, the, specifications, set, forth, in, the, ftp, protocol, initially, anyone, who, wanted, to, share, a, file, had, to, set, up, an, ftp, server, in, order, to, make, the, file, available, to, others, later, anonymous, ftp, sites, became, repositories, for, files, allowing, all, users, to, post, and, retrieve, them, even, with, archive, sites, many, important, files, were, still, scattered, on, small, ftp, servers, these, files, could, be, located, only, by, the, internet, equivalent, of, word, of, mouth, somebody, would, post, an, e, mail, to, a, message, list, or, a, discussion, forum, announcing, the, availability, of, a, file, archie, changed, all, that, it, combined, a, script, based, data, gatherer, which, fetched, site, listings, of, anonymous, ftp, files, with, a, regular, expression, matcher, for, retrieving, file, names, matching, a, user, query, 4, in, other, words, archie, s, gatherer, scoured, ftp, sites, across, the, internet, and, indexed, all, of, the, files, it, found, its, regular, expression, matcher, provided, users, with, access, to, its, database, in, 1993, the, university, of, nevada, system, computing, services, group, developed, veronica, it, was, created, as, a, type, of, searching, device, similar, to, archie, but, for, gopher, files, another, gopher, search, service, called, jughead, appeared, a, little, later, probably, for, the, sole, purpose, of, rounding, out, the, comic, strip, triumvirate, jughead, is, an, acronym, for, jonzy, s, universal, gopher, hierarchy, excavation, and, display, although, like, veronica, it, is, probably, safe, to, assume, that, the, creator, backed, into, the, acronym, jughead, s, functionality, was, pretty, much, identical, to, veronica, s, although, it, appears, to, be, a, little, rougher, around, the, edges, the, world, wide, web, wanderer, developed, by, matthew, gray, in, 1993, was, the, first, robot, on, the, web, and, was, designed, to, track, the, web, s, growth, initially, the, wanderer, counted, only, web, servers, but, shortly, after, its, introduction, it, started, to, capture, urls, as, it, went, along, the, database, of, captured, urls, became, the, wandex, the, first, web, database, matthew, gray, s, wanderer, created, quite, a, controversy, at, the, time, partially, because, early, versions, of, the, software, ran, rampant, through, the, net, and, caused, a, noticeable, netwide, performance, degradation, this, degradation, occurred, because, the, wanderer, would, access, the, same, page, hundreds, of, times, a, day, the, wanderer, soon, amended, its, ways, but, the, controversy, over, whether, robots, were, good, or, bad, for, the, internet, remained, in, response, to, the, wanderer, martijn, koster, created, archie, like, indexing, of, the, web, or, aliweb, in, october, 1993, as, the, name, implies, aliweb, was, the, http, equivalent, of, archie, and, because, of, this, it, is, still, unique, in, many, ways, aliweb, does, not, have, a, web, searching, robot, instead, webmasters, of, participating, sites, post, their, own, index, information, for, each, page, they, want, listed, the, advantage, to, this, method, is, that, users, get, to, describe, their, own, site, and, a, robot, does, not, run, about, eating, up, net, bandwidth, the, disadvantages, of, aliweb, are, more, of, a, problem, today, the, primary, disadvantage, is, that, a, special, indexing, file, must, be, submitted, most, users, do, not, understand, how, to, create, such, a, file, and, therefore, they, do, not, submit, their, pages, this, leads, to, a, relatively, small, database, which, meant, that, users, are, less, likely, to, search, aliweb, than, one, of, the, large, bot, based, sites, this, catch, 22, has, been, somewhat, offset, by, incorporating, other, databases, into, the, aliweb, search, but, it, still, does, not, have, the, mass, appeal, of, search, engines, such, as, yahoo, or, lycos, excite, initially, called, architext, was, started, by, six, stanford, undergraduates, in, february, 1993, their, idea, was, to, use, statistical, analysis, of, word, relationships, in, order, to, provide, more, efficient, searches, through, the, large, amount, of, information, on, the, internet, their, project, was, fully, funded, by, mid, 1993, once, funding, was, secured, they, released, a, version, of, their, search, software, for, webmasters, to, use, on, their, own, web, sites, at, the, time, the, software, was, called, architext, but, it, now, goes, by, the, name, of, excite, for, web, servers, excite, was, the, first, serious, commercial, search, engine, which, launched, in, 1995, it, was, developed, in, stanford, and, was, purchased, for, 6, 5, billion, by, home, in, 2001, excite, and, home, went, bankrupt, and, infospace, bought, excite, for, 10, million, some, of, the, first, analysis, of, web, searching, was, conducted, on, search, logs, from, excite, in, april, 1994, two, stanford, university, ph, d, candidates, david, filo, and, jerry, yang, created, some, pages, that, became, rather, popular, they, called, the, collection, of, pages, yahoo, their, official, explanation, for, the, name, choice, was, that, they, considered, themselves, to, be, a, pair, of, yahoos, as, the, number, of, links, grew, and, their, pages, began, to, receive, thousands, of, hits, a, day, the, team, created, ways, to, better, organize, the, data, in, order, to, aid, in, data, retrieval, yahoo, www, yahoo, com, became, a, searchable, directory, the, search, feature, was, a, simple, database, search, engine, because, yahoo, entries, were, entered, and, categorized, manually, yahoo, was, not, really, classified, as, a, search, engine, instead, it, was, generally, considered, to, be, a, searchable, directory, yahoo, has, since, automated, some, aspects, of, the, gathering, and, classification, process, blurring, the, distinction, between, engine, and, directory, the, wanderer, captured, only, urls, which, made, it, difficult, to, find, things, that, were, not, explicitly, described, by, their, url, because, urls, are, rather, cryptic, to, begin, with, this, did, not, help, the, average, user, searching, yahoo, or, the, galaxy, was, much, more, effective, because, they, contained, additional, descriptive, information, about, the, indexed, sites, at, carnegie, mellon, university, during, july, 1994, michael, mauldin, on, leave, from, cmu, developed, the, lycos, search, engine, search, engines, on, the, web, are, sites, enriched, with, facility, to, search, the, content, stored, on, other, sites, there, is, difference, in, the, way, various, search, engines, work, but, they, all, perform, three, basic, tasks, the, process, begins, when, a, user, enters, a, query, statement, into, the, system, through, the, interface, provided, there, are, basically, three, types, of, search, engines, those, that, are, powered, by, robots, called, crawlers, ants, or, spiders, and, those, that, are, powered, by, human, submissions, and, those, that, are, a, hybrid, of, the, two, crawler, based, search, engines, are, those, that, use, automated, software, agents, called, crawlers, that, visit, a, web, site, read, the, information, on, the, actual, site, read, the, site, s, meta, tags, and, also, follow, the, links, that, the, site, connects, to, performing, indexing, on, all, linked, web, sites, as, well, the, crawler, returns, all, that, information, back, to, a, central, depository, where, the, data, is, indexed, the, crawler, will, periodically, return, to, the, sites, to, check, for, any, information, that, has, changed, the, frequency, with, which, this, happens, is, determined, by, the, administrators, of, the, search, engine, human, powered, search, engines, rely, on, humans, to, submit, information, that, is, subsequently, indexed, and, catalogued, only, information, that, is, submitted, is, put, into, the, index, in, both, cases, when, you, query, a, search, engine, to, locate, information, you, re, actually, searching, through, the, index, that, the, search, engine, has, created, you, are, not, actually, searching, the, web, these, indices, are, giant, databases, of, information, that, is, collected, and, stored, and, subsequently, searched, this, explains, why, sometimes, a, search, on, a, commercial, search, engine, such, as, yahoo, or, google, will, return, results, that, are, in, fact, dead, links, since, the, search, results, are, based, on, the, index, if, the, index, has, not, been, updated, since, a, web, page, became, invalid, the, search, engine, treats, the, page, as, still, an, active, link, even, though, it, no, longer, is, it, will, remain, that, way, until, the, index, is, updated, so, why, will, the, same, search, on, different, search, engines, produce, different, results, part, of, the, answer, to, that, question, is, because, not, all, indices, are, going, to, be, exactly, the, same, it, depends, on, what, the, spiders, find, or, what, the, humans, submitted, but, more, important, not, every, search, engine, uses, the, same, algorithm, to, search, through, the, indices, the, algorithm, is, what, the, search, engines, use, to, determine, the, relevance, of, the, information, in, the, index, to, what, the, user, is, searching, for, one, of, the, elements, that, a, search, engine, algorithm, scans, for, is, the, frequency, and, location, of, keywords, on, a, web, page, those, with, higher, frequency, are, typically, considered, more, relevant, but, search, engine, technology, is, becoming, sophisticated, in, its, attempt, to, discourage, what, is, known, as, keyword, stuffing, or, spamdexing, another, common, element, that, algorithms, analyze, is, the, way, that, pages, link, to, other, pages, in, the, web, by, analyzing, how, pages, link, to, each, other, an, engine, can, both, determine, what, a, page, is, about, if, the, keywords, of, the, linked, pages, are, similar, to, the, keywords, on, the, original, page, and, whether, that, page, is, considered, important, and, deserving, of, a, boost, in, ranking, just, as, the, technology, is, becoming, increasingly, sophisticated, to, ignore, keyword, stuffing, it, is, also, becoming, more, savvy, to, web, masters, who, build, artificial, links, into, their, sites, in, order, to, build, an, artificial, ranking, modern, web, search, engines, are, highly, intricate, software, systems, that, employ, technology, that, has, evolved, over, the, years, there, are, a, number, of, sub, categories, of, search, engine, software, that, are, separately, applicable, to, specific, browsing, needs, these, include, web, search, engines, e, g, google, database, or, structured, data, search, engines, e, g, dieselpoint, and, mixed, search, engines, or, enterprise, search, the, more, prevalent, search, engines, such, as, google, and, yahoo, utilize, hundreds, of, thousands, computers, to, process, trillions, of, web, pages, in, order, to, return, fairly, well, aimed, results, due, to, this, high, volume, of, queries, and, text, processing, the, software, is, required, to, run, in, a, highly, dispersed, environment, with, a, high, degree, of, superfluity, another, category, of, search, engines, is, scientific, search, engines, these, are, search, engines, which, search, scientific, literature, the, best, known, example, is, google, scholar, researchers, are, working, on, improving, search, engine, technology, by, making, them, understand, the, content, element, of, the, articles, such, as, extracting, theoretical, constructs, or, key, research, findings
