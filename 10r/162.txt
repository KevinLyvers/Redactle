electrical, engineering, is, an, engineering, discipline, concerned, with, the, study, design, and, application, of, equipment, devices, and, systems, which, use, electricity, electronics, and, electromagnetism, it, emerged, as, an, identifiable, occupation, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, after, the, commercialization, of, the, electric, telegraph, the, telephone, and, electrical, power, generation, distribution, and, use, electrical, engineering, is, divided, into, a, wide, range, of, different, fields, including, computer, engineering, systems, engineering, power, engineering, telecommunications, radio, frequency, engineering, signal, processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic, cells, electronics, and, optics, and, photonics, many, of, these, disciplines, overlap, with, other, engineering, branches, spanning, a, huge, number, of, specializations, including, hardware, engineering, power, electronics, electromagnetics, and, waves, microwave, engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable, energies, mechatronics, control, and, electrical, materials, science, electrical, engineers, typically, hold, a, degree, in, electrical, engineering, electronic, or, electrical, and, electronic, engineering, practicing, engineers, may, have, professional, certification, and, be, members, of, a, professional, body, or, an, international, standards, organization, these, include, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, and, the, institution, of, engineering, and, technology, iet, formerly, the, iee, electrical, engineers, work, in, a, very, wide, range, of, industries, and, the, skills, required, are, likewise, variable, these, range, from, circuit, theory, to, the, management, skills, of, a, project, manager, the, tools, and, equipment, that, an, individual, engineer, may, need, are, similarly, variable, ranging, from, a, simple, voltmeter, to, sophisticated, design, and, manufacturing, software, electricity, has, been, a, subject, of, scientific, interest, since, at, least, the, early, 17th, century, william, gilbert, was, a, prominent, early, electrical, scientist, and, was, the, first, to, draw, a, clear, distinction, between, magnetism, and, static, electricity, he, is, credited, with, establishing, the, term, electricity, he, also, designed, the, versorium, a, device, that, detects, the, presence, of, statically, charged, objects, in, 1762, swedish, professor, johan, wilcke, invented, a, device, later, named, electrophorus, that, produced, a, static, electric, charge, by, 1800, alessandro, volta, had, developed, the, voltaic, pile, a, forerunner, of, the, electric, battery, in, the, 19th, century, research, into, the, subject, started, to, intensify, notable, developments, in, this, century, include, the, work, of, hans, christian, rsted, who, discovered, in, 1820, that, an, electric, current, produces, a, magnetic, field, that, will, deflect, a, compass, needle, of, william, sturgeon, who, in, 1825, invented, the, electromagnet, of, joseph, henry, and, edward, davy, who, invented, the, electrical, relay, in, 1835, of, georg, ohm, who, in, 1827, quantified, the, relationship, between, the, electric, current, and, potential, difference, in, a, conductor, of, michael, faraday, the, discoverer, of, electromagnetic, induction, in, 1831, and, of, james, clerk, maxwell, who, in, 1873, published, a, unified, theory, of, electricity, and, magnetism, in, his, treatise, electricity, and, magnetism, in, 1782, georges, louis, le, sage, developed, and, presented, in, berlin, probably, the, world, s, first, form, of, electric, telegraphy, using, 24, different, wires, one, for, each, letter, of, the, alphabet, this, telegraph, connected, two, rooms, it, was, an, electrostatic, telegraph, that, moved, gold, leaf, through, electrical, conduction, in, 1795, francisco, salva, campillo, proposed, an, electrostatic, telegraph, system, between, 1803, and, 1804, he, worked, on, electrical, telegraphy, and, in, 1804, he, presented, his, report, at, the, royal, academy, of, natural, sciences, and, arts, of, barcelona, salva, s, electrolyte, telegraph, system, was, very, innovative, though, it, was, greatly, influenced, by, and, based, upon, two, discoveries, made, in, europe, in, 1800, alessandro, volta, s, electric, battery, for, generating, an, electric, current, and, william, nicholson, and, anthony, carlyle, s, electrolysis, of, water, electrical, telegraphy, may, be, considered, the, first, example, of, electrical, engineering, electrical, engineering, became, a, profession, in, the, later, 19th, century, practitioners, had, created, a, global, electric, telegraph, network, and, the, first, professional, electrical, engineering, institutions, were, founded, in, the, uk, and, the, us, to, support, the, new, discipline, francis, ronalds, created, an, electric, telegraph, system, in, 1816, and, documented, his, vision, of, how, the, world, could, be, transformed, by, electricity, over, 50, years, later, he, joined, the, new, society, of, telegraph, engineers, soon, to, be, renamed, the, institution, of, electrical, engineers, where, he, was, regarded, by, other, members, as, the, first, of, their, cohort, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, world, had, been, forever, changed, by, the, rapid, communication, made, possible, by, the, engineering, development, of, land, lines, submarine, cables, and, from, about, 1890, wireless, telegraphy, practical, applications, and, advances, in, such, fields, created, an, increasing, need, for, standardized, units, of, measure, they, led, to, the, international, standardization, of, the, units, volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and, henry, this, was, achieved, at, an, international, conference, in, chicago, in, 1893, the, publication, of, these, standards, formed, the, basis, of, future, advances, in, standardization, in, various, industries, and, in, many, countries, the, definitions, were, immediately, recognized, in, relevant, legislation, during, these, years, the, study, of, electricity, was, largely, considered, to, be, a, subfield, of, physics, since, early, electrical, technology, was, considered, electromechanical, in, nature, the, technische, universit, t, darmstadt, founded, the, world, s, first, department, of, electrical, engineering, in, 1882, and, introduced, the, first, degree, course, in, electrical, engineering, in, 1883, the, first, electrical, engineering, degree, program, in, the, united, states, was, started, at, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, in, the, physics, department, under, professor, charles, cross, though, it, was, cornell, university, to, produce, the, world, s, first, electrical, engineering, graduates, in, 1885, the, first, course, in, electrical, engineering, was, taught, in, 1883, in, cornell, s, sibley, college, of, mechanical, engineering, and, mechanic, arts, in, about, 1885, cornell, president, andrew, dickson, white, established, the, first, department, of, electrical, engineering, in, the, united, states, in, the, same, year, university, college, london, founded, the, first, chair, of, electrical, engineering, in, great, britain, professor, mendell, p, weinbach, at, university, of, missouri, established, the, electrical, engineering, department, in, 1886, afterwards, universities, and, institutes, of, technology, gradually, started, to, offer, electrical, engineering, programs, to, their, students, all, over, the, world, during, these, decades, the, use, of, electrical, engineering, increased, dramatically, in, 1882, thomas, edison, switched, on, the, world, s, first, large, scale, electric, power, network, that, provided, 110, volts, direct, current, dc, to, 59, customers, on, manhattan, island, in, new, york, city, in, 1884, sir, charles, parsons, invented, the, steam, turbine, allowing, for, more, efficient, electric, power, generation, alternating, current, with, its, ability, to, transmit, power, more, efficiently, over, long, distances, via, the, use, of, transformers, developed, rapidly, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, with, transformer, designs, by, k, roly, zipernowsky, ott, bl, thy, and, miksa, d, ri, later, called, zbd, transformers, lucien, gaulard, john, dixon, gibbs, and, william, stanley, jr, practical, ac, motor, designs, including, induction, motors, were, independently, invented, by, galileo, ferraris, and, nikola, tesla, and, further, developed, into, a, practical, three, phase, form, by, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, and, charles, eugene, lancelot, brown, charles, steinmetz, and, oliver, heaviside, contributed, to, the, theoretical, basis, of, alternating, current, engineering, the, spread, in, the, use, of, ac, set, off, in, the, united, states, what, has, been, called, the, war, of, the, currents, between, a, george, westinghouse, backed, ac, system, and, a, thomas, edison, backed, dc, power, system, with, ac, being, adopted, as, the, overall, standard, during, the, development, of, radio, many, scientists, and, inventors, contributed, to, radio, technology, and, electronics, the, mathematical, work, of, james, clerk, maxwell, during, the, 1850s, had, shown, the, relationship, of, different, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, including, the, possibility, of, invisible, airborne, waves, later, called, radio, waves, in, his, classic, physics, experiments, of, 1888, heinrich, hertz, proved, maxwell, s, theory, by, transmitting, radio, waves, with, a, spark, gap, transmitter, and, detected, them, by, using, simple, electrical, devices, other, physicists, experimented, with, these, new, waves, and, in, the, process, developed, devices, for, transmitting, and, detecting, them, in, 1895, guglielmo, marconi, began, work, on, a, way, to, adapt, the, known, methods, of, transmitting, and, detecting, these, hertzian, waves, into, a, purpose, built, commercial, wireless, telegraphic, system, early, on, he, sent, wireless, signals, over, a, distance, of, one, and, a, half, miles, in, december, 1901, he, sent, wireless, waves, that, were, not, affected, by, the, curvature, of, the, earth, marconi, later, transmitted, the, wireless, signals, across, the, atlantic, between, poldhu, cornwall, and, st, john, s, newfoundland, a, distance, of, 2, 100, miles, 3, 400, km, millimetre, wave, communication, was, first, investigated, by, jagadish, chandra, bose, during, 1894, 1896, when, he, reached, an, extremely, high, frequency, of, up, to, 60, ghz, in, his, experiments, he, also, introduced, the, use, of, semiconductor, junctions, to, detect, radio, waves, when, he, patented, the, radio, crystal, detector, in, 1901, in, 1897, karl, ferdinand, braun, introduced, the, cathode, ray, tube, as, part, of, an, oscilloscope, a, crucial, enabling, technology, for, electronic, television, john, fleming, invented, the, first, radio, tube, the, diode, in, 1904, two, years, later, robert, von, lieben, and, lee, de, forest, independently, developed, the, amplifier, tube, called, the, triode, in, 1920, albert, hull, developed, the, magnetron, which, would, eventually, lead, to, the, development, of, the, microwave, oven, in, 1946, by, percy, spencer, in, 1934, the, british, military, began, to, make, strides, toward, radar, which, also, uses, the, magnetron, under, the, direction, of, dr, wimperis, culminating, in, the, operation, of, the, first, radar, station, at, bawdsey, in, august, 1936, in, 1941, konrad, zuse, presented, the, z3, the, world, s, first, fully, functional, and, programmable, computer, using, electromechanical, parts, in, 1943, tommy, flowers, designed, and, built, the, colossus, the, world, s, first, fully, functional, electronic, digital, and, programmable, computer, in, 1946, the, eniac, electronic, numerical, integrator, and, computer, of, john, presper, eckert, and, john, mauchly, followed, beginning, the, computing, era, the, arithmetic, performance, of, these, machines, allowed, engineers, to, develop, completely, new, technologies, and, achieve, new, objectives, in, 1948, claude, shannon, published, a, mathematical, theory, of, communication, which, mathematically, describes, the, passage, of, information, with, uncertainty, electrical, noise, the, first, working, transistor, was, a, point, contact, transistor, invented, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, houser, brattain, while, working, under, william, shockley, at, the, bell, telephone, laboratories, btl, in, 1947, they, then, invented, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, in, 1948, while, early, junction, transistors, were, relatively, bulky, devices, that, were, difficult, to, manufacture, on, a, mass, production, basis, they, opened, the, door, for, more, compact, devices, the, first, integrated, circuits, were, the, hybrid, integrated, circuit, invented, by, jack, kilby, at, texas, instruments, in, 1958, and, the, monolithic, integrated, circuit, chip, invented, by, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1959, the, mosfet, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, or, mos, transistor, was, invented, by, mohamed, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, btl, in, 1959, it, was, the, first, truly, compact, transistor, that, could, be, miniaturised, and, mass, produced, for, a, wide, range, of, uses, it, revolutionized, the, electronics, industry, becoming, the, most, widely, used, electronic, device, in, the, world, the, mosfet, made, it, possible, to, build, high, density, integrated, circuit, chips, the, earliest, experimental, mos, ic, chip, to, be, fabricated, was, built, by, fred, heiman, and, steven, hofstein, at, rca, laboratories, in, 1962, mos, technology, enabled, moore, s, law, the, doubling, of, transistors, on, an, ic, chip, every, two, years, predicted, by, gordon, moore, in, 1965, silicon, gate, mos, technology, was, developed, by, federico, faggin, at, fairchild, in, 1968, since, then, the, mosfet, has, been, the, basic, building, block, of, modern, electronics, the, mass, production, of, silicon, mosfets, and, mos, integrated, circuit, chips, along, with, continuous, mosfet, scaling, miniaturization, at, an, exponential, pace, as, predicted, by, moore, s, law, has, since, led, to, revolutionary, changes, in, technology, economy, culture, and, thinking, the, apollo, program, which, culminated, in, landing, astronauts, on, the, moon, with, apollo, 11, in, 1969, was, enabled, by, nasa, s, adoption, of, advances, in, semiconductor, electronic, technology, including, mosfets, in, the, interplanetary, monitoring, platform, imp, and, silicon, integrated, circuit, chips, in, the, apollo, guidance, computer, agc, the, development, of, mos, integrated, circuit, technology, in, the, 1960s, led, to, the, invention, of, the, microprocessor, in, the, early, 1970s, the, first, single, chip, microprocessor, was, the, intel, 4004, released, in, 1971, the, intel, 4004, was, designed, and, realized, by, federico, faggin, at, intel, with, his, silicon, gate, mos, technology, along, with, intel, s, marcian, hoff, and, stanley, mazor, and, busicom, s, masatoshi, shima, the, microprocessor, led, to, the, development, of, microcomputers, and, personal, computers, and, the, microcomputer, revolution, one, of, the, properties, of, electricity, is, that, it, is, very, useful, for, energy, transmission, as, well, as, for, information, transmission, these, were, also, the, first, areas, in, which, electrical, engineering, was, developed, today, electrical, engineering, has, many, subdisciplines, the, most, common, of, which, are, listed, below, although, there, are, electrical, engineers, who, focus, exclusively, on, one, of, these, subdisciplines, many, deal, with, a, combination, of, them, sometimes, certain, fields, such, as, electronic, engineering, and, computer, engineering, are, considered, disciplines, in, their, own, right, power, energy, engineering, deals, with, the, generation, transmission, and, distribution, of, electricity, as, well, as, the, design, of, a, range, of, related, devices, these, include, transformers, electric, generators, electric, motors, high, voltage, engineering, and, power, electronics, in, many, regions, of, the, world, governments, maintain, an, electrical, network, called, a, power, grid, that, connects, a, variety, of, generators, together, with, users, of, their, energy, users, purchase, electrical, energy, from, the, grid, avoiding, the, costly, exercise, of, having, to, generate, their, own, power, engineers, may, work, on, the, design, and, maintenance, of, the, power, grid, as, well, as, the, power, systems, that, connect, to, it, such, systems, are, called, on, grid, power, systems, and, may, supply, the, grid, with, additional, power, draw, power, from, the, grid, or, do, both, power, engineers, may, also, work, on, systems, that, do, not, connect, to, the, grid, called, off, grid, power, systems, which, in, some, cases, are, preferable, to, on, grid, systems, telecommunications, engineering, focuses, on, the, transmission, of, information, across, a, communication, channel, such, as, a, coax, cable, optical, fiber, or, free, space, transmissions, across, free, space, require, information, to, be, encoded, in, a, carrier, signal, to, shift, the, information, to, a, carrier, frequency, suitable, for, transmission, this, is, known, as, modulation, popular, analog, modulation, techniques, include, amplitude, modulation, and, frequency, modulation, the, choice, of, modulation, affects, the, cost, and, performance, of, a, system, and, these, two, factors, must, be, balanced, carefully, by, the, engineer, once, the, transmission, characteristics, of, a, system, are, determined, telecommunication, engineers, design, the, transmitters, and, receivers, needed, for, such, systems, these, two, are, sometimes, combined, to, form, a, two, way, communication, device, known, as, a, transceiver, a, key, consideration, in, the, design, of, transmitters, is, their, power, consumption, as, this, is, closely, related, to, their, signal, strength, typically, if, the, power, of, the, transmitted, signal, is, insufficient, once, the, signal, arrives, at, the, receiver, s, antenna, s, the, information, contained, in, the, signal, will, be, corrupted, by, noise, specifically, static, control, engineering, focuses, on, the, modeling, of, a, diverse, range, of, dynamic, systems, and, the, design, of, controllers, that, will, cause, these, systems, to, behave, in, the, desired, manner, to, implement, such, controllers, electronics, control, engineers, may, use, electronic, circuits, digital, signal, processors, microcontrollers, and, programmable, logic, controllers, plcs, control, engineering, has, a, wide, range, of, applications, from, the, flight, and, propulsion, systems, of, commercial, airliners, to, the, cruise, control, present, in, many, modern, automobiles, it, also, plays, an, important, role, in, industrial, automation, control, engineers, often, use, feedback, when, designing, control, systems, for, example, in, an, automobile, with, cruise, control, the, vehicle, s, speed, is, continuously, monitored, and, fed, back, to, the, system, which, adjusts, the, motor, s, power, output, accordingly, where, there, is, regular, feedback, control, theory, can, be, used, to, determine, how, the, system, responds, to, such, feedback, control, engineers, also, work, in, robotics, to, design, autonomous, systems, using, control, algorithms, which, interpret, sensory, feedback, to, control, actuators, that, move, robots, such, as, autonomous, vehicles, autonomous, drones, and, others, used, in, a, variety, of, industries, electronic, engineering, involves, the, design, and, testing, of, electronic, circuits, that, use, the, properties, of, components, such, as, resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and, transistors, to, achieve, a, particular, functionality, the, tuned, circuit, which, allows, the, user, of, a, radio, to, filter, out, all, but, a, single, station, is, just, one, example, of, such, a, circuit, another, example, to, research, is, a, pneumatic, signal, conditioner, prior, to, the, second, world, war, the, subject, was, commonly, known, as, radio, engineering, and, basically, was, restricted, to, aspects, of, communications, and, radar, commercial, radio, and, early, television, later, in, post, war, years, as, consumer, devices, began, to, be, developed, the, field, grew, to, include, modern, television, audio, systems, computers, and, microprocessors, in, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, the, term, radio, engineering, gradually, gave, way, to, the, name, electronic, engineering, before, the, invention, of, the, integrated, circuit, in, 1959, electronic, circuits, were, constructed, from, discrete, components, that, could, be, manipulated, by, humans, these, discrete, circuits, consumed, much, space, and, power, and, were, limited, in, speed, although, they, are, still, common, in, some, applications, by, contrast, integrated, circuits, packed, a, large, number, often, millions, of, tiny, electrical, components, mainly, transistors, into, a, small, chip, around, the, size, of, a, coin, this, allowed, for, the, powerful, computers, and, other, electronic, devices, we, see, today, microelectronics, engineering, deals, with, the, design, and, microfabrication, of, very, small, electronic, circuit, components, for, use, in, an, integrated, circuit, or, sometimes, for, use, on, their, own, as, a, general, electronic, component, the, most, common, microelectronic, components, are, semiconductor, transistors, although, all, main, electronic, components, resistors, capacitors, etc, can, be, created, at, a, microscopic, level, nanoelectronics, is, the, further, scaling, of, devices, down, to, nanometer, levels, modern, devices, are, already, in, the, nanometer, regime, with, below, 100, nm, processing, having, been, standard, since, around, 2002, microelectronic, components, are, created, by, chemically, fabricating, wafers, of, semiconductors, such, as, silicon, at, higher, frequencies, compound, semiconductors, like, gallium, arsenide, and, indium, phosphide, to, obtain, the, desired, transport, of, electronic, charge, and, control, of, current, the, field, of, microelectronics, involves, a, significant, amount, of, chemistry, and, material, science, and, requires, the, electronic, engineer, working, in, the, field, to, have, a, very, good, working, knowledge, of, the, effects, of, quantum, mechanics, signal, processing, deals, with, the, analysis, and, manipulation, of, signals, signals, can, be, either, analog, in, which, case, the, signal, varies, continuously, according, to, the, information, or, digital, in, which, case, the, signal, varies, according, to, a, series, of, discrete, values, representing, the, information, for, analog, signals, signal, processing, may, involve, the, amplification, and, filtering, of, audio, signals, for, audio, equipment, or, the, modulation, and, demodulation, of, signals, for, telecommunications, for, digital, signals, signal, processing, may, involve, the, compression, error, detection, and, error, correction, of, digitally, sampled, signals, signal, processing, is, a, very, mathematically, oriented, and, intensive, area, forming, the, core, of, digital, signal, processing, and, it, is, rapidly, expanding, with, new, applications, in, every, field, of, electrical, engineering, such, as, communications, control, radar, audio, engineering, broadcast, engineering, power, electronics, and, biomedical, engineering, as, many, already, existing, analog, systems, are, replaced, with, their, digital, counterparts, analog, signal, processing, is, still, important, in, the, design, of, many, control, systems, dsp, processor, ics, are, found, in, many, types, of, modern, electronic, devices, such, as, digital, television, sets, radios, hi, fi, audio, equipment, mobile, phones, multimedia, players, camcorders, and, digital, cameras, automobile, control, systems, noise, cancelling, headphones, digital, spectrum, analyzers, missile, guidance, systems, radar, systems, and, telematics, systems, in, such, products, dsp, may, be, responsible, for, noise, reduction, speech, recognition, or, synthesis, encoding, or, decoding, digital, media, wirelessly, transmitting, or, receiving, data, triangulating, positions, using, gps, and, other, kinds, of, image, processing, video, processing, audio, processing, and, speech, processing, instrumentation, engineering, deals, with, the, design, of, devices, to, measure, physical, quantities, such, as, pressure, flow, and, temperature, the, design, of, such, instruments, requires, a, good, understanding, of, physics, that, often, extends, beyond, electromagnetic, theory, for, example, flight, instruments, measure, variables, such, as, wind, speed, and, altitude, to, enable, pilots, the, control, of, aircraft, analytically, similarly, thermocouples, use, the, peltier, seebeck, effect, to, measure, the, temperature, difference, between, two, points, often, instrumentation, is, not, used, by, itself, but, instead, as, the, sensors, of, larger, electrical, systems, for, example, a, thermocouple, might, be, used, to, help, ensure, a, furnace, s, temperature, remains, constant, for, this, reason, instrumentation, engineering, is, often, viewed, as, the, counterpart, of, control, computer, engineering, deals, with, the, design, of, computers, and, computer, systems, this, may, involve, the, design, of, new, hardware, computer, engineers, may, also, work, on, a, system, s, software, however, the, design, of, complex, software, systems, is, often, the, domain, of, software, engineering, which, is, usually, considered, a, separate, discipline, desktop, computers, represent, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, devices, a, computer, engineer, might, work, on, as, computer, like, architectures, are, now, found, in, a, range, of, embedded, devices, including, video, game, consoles, and, dvd, players, computer, engineers, are, involved, in, many, hardware, and, software, aspects, of, computing, robots, are, one, of, the, applications, of, computer, engineering, photonics, and, optics, deals, with, the, generation, transmission, amplification, modulation, detection, and, analysis, of, electromagnetic, radiation, the, application, of, optics, deals, with, design, of, optical, instruments, such, as, lenses, microscopes, telescopes, and, other, equipment, that, uses, the, properties, of, electromagnetic, radiation, other, prominent, applications, of, optics, include, electro, optical, sensors, and, measurement, systems, lasers, fiber, optic, communication, systems, and, optical, disc, systems, e, g, cd, and, dvd, photonics, builds, heavily, on, optical, technology, supplemented, with, modern, developments, such, as, optoelectronics, mostly, involving, semiconductors, laser, systems, optical, amplifiers, and, novel, materials, e, g, metamaterials, mechatronics, is, an, engineering, discipline, which, deals, with, the, convergence, of, electrical, and, mechanical, systems, such, combined, systems, are, known, as, electromechanical, systems, and, have, widespread, adoption, examples, include, automated, manufacturing, systems, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, systems, and, various, subsystems, of, aircraft, and, automobiles, electronic, systems, design, is, the, subject, within, electrical, engineering, that, deals, with, the, multi, disciplinary, design, issues, of, complex, electrical, and, mechanical, systems, the, term, mechatronics, is, typically, used, to, refer, to, macroscopic, systems, but, futurists, have, predicted, the, emergence, of, very, small, electromechanical, devices, already, such, small, devices, known, as, microelectromechanical, systems, mems, are, used, in, automobiles, to, tell, airbags, when, to, deploy, in, digital, projectors, to, create, sharper, images, and, in, inkjet, printers, to, create, nozzles, for, high, definition, printing, in, the, future, it, is, hoped, the, devices, will, help, build, tiny, implantable, medical, devices, and, improve, optical, communication, in, aerospace, engineering, and, robotics, an, example, is, the, most, recent, electric, propulsion, and, ion, propulsion, electrical, engineers, typically, possess, an, academic, degree, with, a, major, in, electrical, engineering, electronics, engineering, electrical, engineering, technology, or, electrical, and, electronic, engineering, the, same, fundamental, principles, are, taught, in, all, programs, though, emphasis, may, vary, according, to, title, the, length, of, study, for, such, a, degree, is, usually, four, or, five, years, and, the, completed, degree, may, be, designated, as, a, bachelor, of, science, in, electrical, electronics, engineering, technology, bachelor, of, engineering, bachelor, of, science, bachelor, of, technology, or, bachelor, of, applied, science, depending, on, the, university, the, bachelor, s, degree, generally, includes, units, covering, physics, mathematics, computer, science, project, management, and, a, variety, of, topics, in, electrical, engineering, initially, such, topics, cover, most, if, not, all, of, the, subdisciplines, of, electrical, engineering, at, some, schools, the, students, can, then, choose, to, emphasize, one, or, more, subdisciplines, towards, the, end, of, their, courses, of, study, at, many, schools, electronic, engineering, is, included, as, part, of, an, electrical, award, sometimes, explicitly, such, as, a, bachelor, of, engineering, electrical, and, electronic, but, in, others, electrical, and, electronic, engineering, are, both, considered, to, be, sufficiently, broad, and, complex, that, separate, degrees, are, offered, some, electrical, engineers, choose, to, study, for, a, postgraduate, degree, such, as, a, master, of, engineering, master, of, science, meng, msc, a, master, of, engineering, management, a, doctor, of, philosophy, phd, in, engineering, an, engineering, doctorate, eng, d, or, an, engineer, s, degree, the, master, s, and, engineer, s, degrees, may, consist, of, either, research, coursework, or, a, mixture, of, the, two, the, doctor, of, philosophy, and, engineering, doctorate, degrees, consist, of, a, significant, research, component, and, are, often, viewed, as, the, entry, point, to, academia, in, the, united, kingdom, and, some, other, european, countries, master, of, engineering, is, often, considered, to, be, an, undergraduate, degree, of, slightly, longer, duration, than, the, bachelor, of, engineering, rather, than, a, standalone, postgraduate, degree, in, most, countries, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, engineering, represents, the, first, step, towards, professional, certification, and, the, degree, program, itself, is, certified, by, a, professional, body, after, completing, a, certified, degree, program, the, engineer, must, satisfy, a, range, of, requirements, including, work, experience, requirements, before, being, certified, once, certified, the, engineer, is, designated, the, title, of, professional, engineer, in, the, united, states, canada, and, south, africa, chartered, engineer, or, incorporated, engineer, in, india, pakistan, the, united, kingdom, ireland, and, zimbabwe, chartered, professional, engineer, in, australia, and, new, zealand, or, european, engineer, in, much, of, the, european, union, the, advantages, of, licensure, vary, depending, upon, location, for, example, in, the, united, states, and, canada, only, a, licensed, engineer, may, seal, engineering, work, for, public, and, private, clients, this, requirement, is, enforced, by, state, and, provincial, legislation, such, as, quebec, s, engineers, act, in, other, countries, no, such, legislation, exists, practically, all, certifying, bodies, maintain, a, code, of, ethics, that, they, expect, all, members, to, abide, by, or, risk, expulsion, in, this, way, these, organizations, play, an, important, role, in, maintaining, ethical, standards, for, the, profession, even, in, jurisdictions, where, certification, has, little, or, no, legal, bearing, on, work, engineers, are, subject, to, contract, law, in, cases, where, an, engineer, s, work, fails, he, or, she, may, be, subject, to, the, tort, of, negligence, and, in, extreme, cases, the, charge, of, criminal, negligence, an, engineer, s, work, must, also, comply, with, numerous, other, rules, and, regulations, such, as, building, codes, and, legislation, pertaining, to, environmental, law, professional, bodies, of, note, for, electrical, engineers, include, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, and, the, institution, of, engineering, and, technology, iet, the, ieee, claims, to, produce, 30, of, the, world, s, literature, in, electrical, engineering, has, over, 360, 000, members, worldwide, and, holds, over, 3, 000, conferences, annually, the, iet, publishes, 21, journals, has, a, worldwide, membership, of, over, 150, 000, and, claims, to, be, the, largest, professional, engineering, society, in, europe, obsolescence, of, technical, skills, is, a, serious, concern, for, electrical, engineers, membership, and, participation, in, technical, societies, regular, reviews, of, periodicals, in, the, field, and, a, habit, of, continued, learning, are, therefore, essential, to, maintaining, proficiency, an, miet, member, of, the, institution, of, engineering, and, technology, is, recognised, in, europe, as, an, electrical, and, computer, technology, engineer, in, australia, canada, and, the, united, states, electrical, engineers, make, up, around, 0, 25, of, the, labor, force, from, the, global, positioning, system, to, electric, power, generation, electrical, engineers, have, contributed, to, the, development, of, a, wide, range, of, technologies, they, design, develop, test, and, supervise, the, deployment, of, electrical, systems, and, electronic, devices, for, example, they, may, work, on, the, design, of, telecommunications, systems, the, operation, of, electric, power, stations, the, lighting, and, wiring, of, buildings, the, design, of, household, appliances, or, the, electrical, control, of, industrial, machinery, fundamental, to, the, discipline, are, the, sciences, of, physics, and, mathematics, as, these, help, to, obtain, both, a, qualitative, and, quantitative, description, of, how, such, systems, will, work, today, most, engineering, work, involves, the, use, of, computers, and, it, is, commonplace, to, use, computer, aided, design, programs, when, designing, electrical, systems, nevertheless, the, ability, to, sketch, ideas, is, still, invaluable, for, quickly, communicating, with, others, although, most, electrical, engineers, will, understand, basic, circuit, theory, that, is, the, interactions, of, elements, such, as, resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and, inductors, in, a, circuit, the, theories, employed, by, engineers, generally, depend, upon, the, work, they, do, for, example, quantum, mechanics, and, solid, state, physics, might, be, relevant, to, an, engineer, working, on, vlsi, the, design, of, integrated, circuits, but, are, largely, irrelevant, to, engineers, working, with, macroscopic, electrical, systems, even, circuit, theory, may, not, be, relevant, to, a, person, designing, telecommunications, systems, that, use, off, the, shelf, components, perhaps, the, most, important, technical, skills, for, electrical, engineers, are, reflected, in, university, programs, which, emphasize, strong, numerical, skills, computer, literacy, and, the, ability, to, understand, the, technical, language, and, concepts, that, relate, to, electrical, engineering, a, wide, range, of, instrumentation, is, used, by, electrical, engineers, for, simple, control, circuits, and, alarms, a, basic, multimeter, measuring, voltage, current, and, resistance, may, suffice, where, time, varying, signals, need, to, be, studied, the, oscilloscope, is, also, an, ubiquitous, instrument, in, rf, engineering, and, high, frequency, telecommunications, spectrum, analyzers, and, network, analyzers, are, used, in, some, disciplines, safety, can, be, a, particular, concern, with, instrumentation, for, instance, medical, electronics, designers, must, take, into, account, that, much, lower, voltages, than, normal, can, be, dangerous, when, electrodes, are, directly, in, contact, with, internal, body, fluids, power, transmission, engineering, also, has, great, safety, concerns, due, to, the, high, voltages, used, although, voltmeters, may, in, principle, be, similar, to, their, low, voltage, equivalents, safety, and, calibration, issues, make, them, very, different, many, disciplines, of, electrical, engineering, use, tests, specific, to, their, discipline, audio, electronics, engineers, use, audio, test, sets, consisting, of, a, signal, generator, and, a, meter, principally, to, measure, level, but, also, other, parameters, such, as, harmonic, distortion, and, noise, likewise, information, technology, have, their, own, test, sets, often, specific, to, a, particular, data, format, and, the, same, is, true, of, television, broadcasting, for, many, engineers, technical, work, accounts, for, only, a, fraction, of, the, work, they, do, a, lot, of, time, may, also, be, spent, on, tasks, such, as, discussing, proposals, with, clients, preparing, budgets, and, determining, project, schedules, many, senior, engineers, manage, a, team, of, technicians, or, other, engineers, and, for, this, reason, project, management, skills, are, important, most, engineering, projects, involve, some, form, of, documentation, and, strong, written, communication, skills, are, therefore, very, important, the, workplaces, of, engineers, are, just, as, varied, as, the, types, of, work, they, do, electrical, engineers, may, be, found, in, the, pristine, lab, environment, of, a, fabrication, plant, on, board, a, naval, ship, the, offices, of, a, consulting, firm, or, on, site, at, a, mine, during, their, working, life, electrical, engineers, may, find, themselves, supervising, a, wide, range, of, individuals, including, scientists, electricians, computer, programmers, and, other, engineers, electrical, engineering, has, an, intimate, relationship, with, the, physical, sciences, for, instance, the, physicist, lord, kelvin, played, a, major, role, in, the, engineering, of, the, first, transatlantic, telegraph, cable, conversely, the, engineer, oliver, heaviside, produced, major, work, on, the, mathematics, of, transmission, on, telegraph, cables, electrical, engineers, are, often, required, on, major, science, projects, for, instance, large, particle, accelerators, such, as, cern, need, electrical, engineers, to, deal, with, many, aspects, of, the, project, including, the, power, distribution, the, instrumentation, and, the, manufacture, and, installation, of, the, superconducting, electromagnets
