napalm, is, an, incendiary, mixture, of, a, gelling, agent, and, a, volatile, petrochemical, usually, gasoline, or, diesel, fuel, the, name, is, a, portmanteau, of, two, of, the, constituents, of, the, original, thickening, and, gelling, agents, coprecipitated, aluminium, salts, of, na, phthenic, acid, and, palm, itic, acid, a, team, led, by, chemist, louis, fieser, originally, developed, napalm, for, the, us, chemical, warfare, service, in, 1942, in, a, secret, laboratory, at, harvard, university, of, immediate, first, interest, was, its, viability, as, an, incendiary, device, to, be, used, in, fire, bombing, campaigns, during, world, war, ii, its, potential, to, be, coherently, projected, into, a, solid, stream, that, would, carry, for, distance, instead, of, the, bloomy, fireball, of, pure, gasoline, resulted, in, widespread, adoption, in, infantry, and, tank, boat, mounted, flamethrowers, as, well, napalm, burns, at, temperatures, ranging, from, 800, to, 1, 200, c, 1, 470, to, 2, 190, f, it, burns, longer, than, gasoline, is, more, easily, dispersed, and, adheres, to, its, targets, these, traits, make, it, both, effective, and, controversial, it, has, been, widely, used, from, the, air, and, from, the, ground, the, largest, use, having, been, via, airdropped, bombs, in, world, war, ii, in, the, incendiary, attacks, on, japanese, cities, in, 1945, it, was, used, also, for, close, air, support, roles, in, the, first, indochina, war, the, algerian, war, the, korean, war, the, six, day, war, and, the, vietnam, war, napalm, has, also, fueled, most, of, the, flamethrowers, tank, ship, and, infantry, based, used, since, world, war, ii, giving, them, much, greater, range, and, was, a, common, weapon, of, urban, combat, by, both, the, axis, and, the, allies, in, world, war, ii, the, development, of, napalm, was, precipitated, by, the, use, of, jellied, gasoline, mixtures, by, the, allied, forces, during, world, war, ii, f57, latex, used, in, these, early, forms, of, incendiary, devices, became, scarce, since, natural, rubber, was, almost, impossible, to, obtain, after, the, japanese, army, captured, the, rubber, plantations, in, malaya, indonesia, vietnam, and, thailand, this, shortage, of, natural, rubber, prompted, chemists, at, us, companies, such, as, dupont, and, standard, oil, of, new, jersey, and, researchers, at, harvard, university, to, develop, factory, made, alternatives, artificial, rubber, for, all, uses, including, vehicle, tires, tank, tracks, gaskets, hoses, medical, supplies, and, rain, clothing, a, team, of, chemists, led, by, louis, fieser, at, harvard, university, was, the, first, to, develop, synthetic, napalm, during, 1942, the, production, of, napalm, was, first, entrusted, to, nuodex, products, and, by, the, middle, of, april, 1942, they, had, developed, a, brown, dry, powder, that, was, not, sticky, by, itself, but, when, mixed, with, gasoline, turned, into, an, extremely, sticky, and, flammable, substance, one, of, fieser, s, colleagues, suggested, adding, phosphorus, to, the, mix, which, increased, the, ability, to, penetrate, deeply, into, the, musculature, where, it, would, continue, to, burn, day, after, day, on, 4, july, 1942, the, first, test, occurred, on, the, football, field, near, the, harvard, business, school, tests, under, operational, conditions, were, carried, out, at, jefferson, proving, ground, on, condemned, farm, buildings, and, subsequently, at, dugway, proving, ground, on, buildings, designed, and, constructed, to, represent, those, to, be, found, in, german, and, japanese, towns, this, new, mixture, of, chemicals, was, widely, used, by, the, united, states, in, the, second, world, war, for, incendiary, bombs, and, in, flamethrowers, after, its, first, use, in, papua, new, guinea, on, 15, december, 1943, from, 1965, to, 1969, the, dow, chemical, company, manufactured, napalm, for, the, american, armed, forces, after, news, reports, of, napalm, s, deadly, and, disfiguring, effects, were, published, dow, chemical, experienced, boycotts, of, its, products, and, its, recruiters, for, new, chemists, chemical, engineers, etc, graduating, from, college, were, subject, to, campus, boycotts, and, protests, the, management, of, the, company, decided, that, its, first, obligation, was, the, government, meanwhile, napalm, became, a, symbol, for, the, vietnam, war, napalm, was, first, employed, in, incendiary, bombs, and, went, on, to, be, used, as, fuel, for, flamethrowers, the, first, recorded, strategic, use, of, napalm, incendiary, bombs, occurred, in, an, attack, by, the, us, army, air, forces, usaaf, on, berlin, on, 6, march, 1944, using, american, an, m76, incendiary, bombs, with, pt, 1, pyrogel, filler, the, first, known, tactical, use, by, the, usaaf, was, by, the, 368th, fighter, group, ninth, air, force, northeast, of, compi, gne, france, 27, may, 1944, and, the, british, de, havilland, mosquito, fb, mk, vis, of, no, 140, wing, raf, second, tactical, airforce, on, 14, july, 1944, which, also, employed, the, an, m76, incendiary, in, a, reprisal, attack, on, the, 17th, ss, panzergrenadier, division, g, tz, von, berlichingen, in, bonneuil, matours, soldiers, of, this, waffen, ss, unit, had, captured, and, then, killed, a, british, sas, prisoner, of, war, lieutenant, tomos, stephens, taking, part, in, operation, bulbasket, and, seven, local, french, resistance, fighters, although, it, was, not, known, at, the, time, of, the, airstrike, 31, other, pows, from, the, same, sas, unit, and, an, american, airman, who, had, joined, up, with, the, sas, unit, had, also, been, executed, further, use, of, napalm, by, allied, forces, occurred, in, the, pacific, theater, of, operations, where, in, 1944, and, 1945, napalm, was, used, as, a, tactical, weapon, against, japanese, bunkers, pillboxes, tunnels, and, other, fortifications, especially, on, saipan, iwo, jima, the, philippines, and, okinawa, where, deeply, dug, in, japanese, troops, refused, to, surrender, napalm, bombs, were, dropped, by, aviators, of, the, us, navy, the, usaaf, the, us, marine, corps, and, the, royal, air, force, in, support, of, ground, troops, the, m69, incendiary, was, specifically, designed, to, destroy, japanese, civilian, houses, those, bombs, were, widely, used, against, civilians, including, the, bombing, of, tokyo, over, 40, 000, tons, of, an, m69s, were, dropped, on, japanese, cities, during, the, war, when, the, usaafs, on, the, marianas, islands, ran, out, of, conventional, thermite, incendiary, bombs, for, their, b, 29, superfortresses, to, drop, on, large, japanese, cities, its, top, commanders, such, as, general, curtis, lemay, used, napalm, bombs, to, continue, with, fire, raids, in, the, european, theater, of, operations, napalm, was, used, by, american, forces, in, the, siege, of, la, rochelle, in, april, 1945, against, german, soldiers, and, inadvertently, french, civilians, in, royan, about, two, weeks, before, the, end, of, the, war, in, its, first, known, post, wwii, use, us, supplied, napalm, was, used, in, the, greek, civil, war, by, the, greek, national, army, as, part, of, operations, koronis, and, pyrsos, against, the, democratic, army, of, greece, dse, the, military, branch, of, the, communist, party, of, greece, kke, napalm, was, widely, used, by, the, us, during, the, korean, war, the, ground, forces, in, north, korea, holding, defensive, positions, were, often, outnumbered, by, chinese, and, north, koreans, but, us, air, force, and, navy, aviators, had, control, of, the, air, over, nearly, all, of, the, korean, peninsula, hence, the, american, and, other, un, aviators, used, napalm, for, close, air, support, of, the, ground, troops, along, the, border, between, north, korea, and, south, korea, and, also, for, attacks, in, north, korea, napalm, was, used, most, notably, during, the, battle, outpost, harry, in, south, korea, during, the, night, of, 10, 11, june, 1953, eighth, army, chemical, officer, donald, bode, reported, that, on, an, average, good, day, un, pilots, used, 260, 000, liters, 70, 000, us, gal, 58, 000, imp, gal, of, napalm, with, approximately, 230, 000, liters, 60, 000, us, gal, 50, 000, imp, gal, of, this, thrown, by, us, forces, the, new, york, herald, tribune, hailed, napalm, the, no, 1, weapon, in, korea, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, privately, criticized, the, use, of, napalm, in, korea, writing, that, it, was, very, cruel, as, us, un, forces, he, wrote, were, splashing, it, all, over, the, civilian, population, tortur, great, masses, of, people, he, conveyed, these, sentiments, to, u, s, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, omar, bradley, who, never, published, the, statement, publicly, churchill, allowed, bradley, to, issue, a, statement, that, confirmed, u, k, support, for, u, s, napalm, attacks, at, the, same, time, the, french, air, force, regularly, used, napalm, for, close, air, support, of, ground, operations, in, the, first, indochina, war, 1946, 1954, at, first, the, canisters, were, simply, pushed, out, the, side, doors, of, ju, 52, planes, that, had, been, captured, in, germany, later, mostly, b, 26, bombers, were, used, napalm, became, an, intrinsic, element, of, us, military, action, during, the, vietnam, war, as, forces, made, increasing, use, of, it, for, its, tactical, and, psychological, effects, reportedly, about, 352, 000, tonnes, 388, 000, short, tons, 346, 000, long, tons, of, us, napalm, bombs, were, dropped, in, the, region, between, 1963, and, 1973, compared, to, 29, 354, tonnes, 32, 357, short, tons, 28, 890, long, tons, used, over, three, years, in, the, korean, war, and, 15, 000, tonnes, 16, 500, short, tons, 14, 700, long, tons, dropped, on, japan, in, 1945, the, us, air, force, and, us, navy, used, napalm, with, great, effect, against, all, kinds, of, targets, such, as, troops, tanks, buildings, jungles, and, even, railroad, tunnels, the, effect, was, not, always, purely, physical, as, napalm, had, psychological, effects, on, the, enemy, as, well, a, variant, of, napalm, was, produced, in, rhodesia, for, a, type, of, ordnance, known, as, frantan, between, 1968, and, 1978, and, was, used, extensively, by, the, rhodesian, air, force, during, the, bush, war, in, may, 1978, herbert, ushewokunze, minister, of, health, for, the, zimbabwe, african, national, union, zanu, produced, photographic, evidence, of, civilian, victims, of, rhodesian, napalm, strikes, which, he, circulated, during, a, tour, of, the, us, the, government, of, mozambique, and, the, zimbabwe, african, people, s, union, zapu, also, issued, claims, at, around, the, same, time, that, napalm, strikes, against, guerrilla, targets, had, become, a, common, feature, in, rhodesian, military, operations, both, at, home, and, abroad, the, south, african, air, force, frequently, dropped, napalm, from, atlas, impala, strike, aircraft, during, raids, on, guerrilla, bases, in, angola, during, the, south, african, border, war, other, instances, of, napalm, s, use, include, france, during, the, algerian, war, 1954, 1962, portuguese, colonial, war, 1961, 1974, turkey, 1964, dropped, napalm, bombs, in, the, republic, of, cyprus, peru, during, the, 1964, mats, s, massacres, and, the,
