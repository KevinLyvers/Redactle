an, electron, microscope, is, a, microscope, that, uses, a, beam, of, electrons, as, a, source, of, illumination, they, use, electron, optics, that, are, analogous, to, the, glass, lenses, of, an, optical, light, microscope, to, control, the, electron, beam, for, instance, focusing, them, to, produce, magnified, images, or, electron, diffraction, patterns, as, the, wavelength, of, an, electron, can, be, up, to, 100, 000, times, smaller, than, that, of, visible, light, electron, microscopes, have, a, much, higher, resolution, of, about, 0, 1, nm, which, compares, to, about, 200, nm, for, light, microscopes, electron, microscope, may, refer, to, additional, details, can, be, found, in, the, above, links, this, article, contains, some, general, information, mainly, about, transmission, electron, microscopes, many, developments, laid, the, groundwork, of, the, electron, optics, used, in, microscopes, one, significant, step, was, the, work, of, hertz, in, 1883, who, made, a, cathode, ray, tube, with, electrostatic, and, magnetic, deflection, demonstrating, manipulation, of, the, direction, of, an, electron, beam, others, were, focusing, of, the, electrons, by, an, axial, magnetic, field, by, emil, wiechert, in, 1899, improved, oxide, coated, cathodes, which, produced, more, electrons, by, arthur, wehnelt, in, 1905, and, the, development, of, the, electromagnetic, lens, in, 1926, by, hans, busch, according, to, dennis, gabor, the, physicist, le, szil, rd, tried, in, 1928, to, convince, him, to, build, an, electron, microscope, for, which, szil, rd, had, filed, a, patent, to, this, day, the, issue, of, who, invented, the, transmission, electron, microscope, is, controversial, in, 1928, at, the, technische, hochschule, in, charlottenburg, now, technische, universit, t, berlin, adolf, matthias, professor, of, high, voltage, technology, and, electrical, installations, appointed, max, knoll, to, lead, a, team, of, researchers, to, advance, research, on, electron, beams, and, cathode, ray, oscilloscopes, the, team, consisted, of, several, phd, students, including, ernst, ruska, in, 1931, max, knoll, and, ernst, ruska, successfully, generated, magnified, images, of, mesh, grids, placed, over, an, anode, aperture, the, device, a, replicate, of, which, is, shown, in, the, figure, used, two, magnetic, lenses, to, achieve, higher, magnifications, the, first, electron, microscope, max, knoll, died, in, 1969, so, did, not, receive, a, share, of, the, 1986, nobel, prize, for, the, invention, of, electron, microscopes, apparently, independent, of, this, effort, was, work, at, siemens, schuckert, by, reinhold, r, denberg, according, to, patent, law, u, s, patent, no, 2058914, and, 2070318, both, filed, in, 1932, he, is, the, inventor, of, the, electron, microscope, but, it, is, not, clear, when, he, had, a, working, instrument, he, stated, in, a, very, brief, article, in, 1932, that, siemens, had, been, working, on, this, for, some, years, before, the, patents, were, filed, in, 1932, claiming, that, his, effort, was, parallel, to, the, university, development, he, died, in, 1961, so, similar, to, max, knoll, was, not, eligible, for, a, share, of, the, 1986, nobel, prize, in, the, following, year, 1933, ruska, and, knoll, built, the, first, electron, microscope, that, exceeded, the, resolution, of, an, optical, light, microscope, four, years, later, in, 1937, siemens, financed, the, work, of, ernst, ruska, and, bodo, von, borries, and, employed, helmut, ruska, ernst, s, brother, to, develop, applications, for, the, microscope, especially, with, biological, specimens, also, in, 1937, manfred, von, ardenne, pioneered, the, scanning, electron, microscope, siemens, produced, the, first, commercial, electron, microscope, in, 1938, the, first, north, american, electron, microscopes, were, constructed, in, the, 1930s, at, the, washington, state, university, by, anderson, and, fitzsimmons, and, at, the, university, of, toronto, by, eli, franklin, burton, and, students, cecil, hall, james, hillier, and, albert, prebus, siemens, produced, a, transmission, electron, microscope, tem, in, 1939, although, current, transmission, electron, microscopes, are, capable, of, two, million, times, magnification, as, scientific, instruments, they, remain, similar, but, with, improved, optics, in, the, 1940s, high, resolution, electron, microscopes, were, developed, enabling, greater, magnification, and, resolution, by, 1965, albert, crewe, at, the, university, of, chicago, introduced, the, scanning, transmission, electron, microscope, using, a, field, emission, source, enabling, scanning, microscopes, at, high, resolution, by, the, early, 1980s, improvements, in, mechanical, stability, as, well, as, the, use, of, higher, accelerating, voltages, enabled, imaging, of, materials, at, the, atomic, scale, in, the, 1980s, the, field, emission, gun, became, common, for, electron, microscopes, improving, the, image, quality, due, to, the, additional, coherence, and, lower, chromatic, aberrations, the, 2000s, were, marked, by, advancements, in, aberration, corrected, electron, microscopy, allowing, for, significant, improvements, in, resolution, and, clarity, of, images, the, original, form, of, the, electron, microscope, the, transmission, electron, microscope, tem, uses, a, high, voltage, electron, beam, to, illuminate, the, specimen, and, create, an, image, an, electron, beam, is, produced, by, an, electron, gun, with, the, electrons, typically, having, energies, in, the, range, 20, to, 400, kev, focused, by, electromagnetic, lenses, and, transmitted, through, the, specimen, when, it, emerges, from, the, specimen, the, electron, beam, carries, information, about, the, structure, of, the, specimen, that, is, magnified, by, lenses, of, the, microscope, the, spatial, variation, in, this, information, the, image, may, be, viewed, by, projecting, the, magnified, electron, image, onto, a, detector, for, example, the, image, may, be, viewed, directly, by, an, operator, using, a, fluorescent, viewing, screen, coated, with, a, phosphor, or, scintillator, material, such, as, zinc, sulfide, a, high, resolution, phosphor, may, also, be, coupled, by, means, of, a, lens, optical, system, or, a, fibre, optic, light, guide, to, the, sensor, of, a, digital, camera, direct, electron, detectors, have, no, scintillator, and, are, directly, exposed, to, the, electron, beam, which, addresses, some, of, the, limitations, of, scintillator, coupled, cameras, the, resolution, of, tems, is, limited, primarily, by, spherical, aberration, but, a, new, generation, of, hardware, correctors, can, reduce, spherical, aberration, to, increase, the, resolution, in, high, resolution, transmission, electron, microscopy, hrtem, to, below, 0, 5, angstrom, 50, picometres, enabling, magnifications, above, 50, million, times, the, ability, of, hrtem, to, determine, the, positions, of, atoms, within, materials, is, useful, for, nano, technologies, research, and, development, the, stem, rasters, a, focused, incident, probe, across, a, specimen, the, high, resolution, of, the, tem, is, thus, possible, in, stem, the, focusing, action, and, aberrations, occur, before, the, electrons, hit, the, specimen, in, the, stem, but, afterward, in, the, tem, the, stems, use, of, sem, like, beam, rastering, simplifies, annular, dark, field, imaging, and, other, analytical, techniques, but, also, means, that, image, data, is, acquired, in, serial, rather, than, in, parallel, fashion, the, sem, produces, images, by, probing, the, specimen, with, a, focused, electron, beam, that, is, scanned, across, the, specimen, raster, scanning, when, the, electron, beam, interacts, with, the, specimen, it, loses, energy, by, a, variety, of, mechanisms, these, interactions, lead, to, among, other, events, emission, of, low, energy, secondary, electrons, and, high, energy, backscattered, electrons, light, emission, cathodoluminescence, or, x, ray, emission, all, of, which, provide, signals, carrying, information, about, the, properties, of, the, specimen, surface, such, as, its, topography, and, composition, the, image, displayed, by, sem, represents, the, varying, intensity, of, any, of, these, signals, into, the, image, in, a, position, corresponding, to, the, position, of, the, beam, on, the, specimen, when, the, signal, was, generated, sems, are, different, from, tems, in, that, they, use, electrons, with, much, lower, energy, generally, below, 20, kev, while, tems, generally, use, electrons, with, energies, in, the, range, of, 80, 300, kev, thus, the, electron, sources, and, optics, of, the, two, microscopes, have, different, designs, and, they, are, normally, separate, instruments, transmission, electron, microscopes, can, be, used, in, electron, diffraction, mode, where, a, map, of, the, angles, of, the, electrons, leaving, the, sample, is, produced, the, advantages, of, electron, diffraction, over, x, ray, crystallography, are, primarily, in, the, size, of, the, crystals, in, x, ray, crystallography, crystals, are, commonly, visible, by, the, naked, eye, and, are, generally, in, the, hundreds, of, micrometers, in, length, in, comparison, crystals, for, electron, diffraction, must, be, less, than, a, few, hundred, nanometers, in, thickness, and, have, no, lower, boundary, of, size, additionally, electron, diffraction, is, done, on, a, tem, which, can, also, be, used, to, obtain, many, other, types, of, information, rather, than, requiring, a, separate, instrument, materials, to, be, viewed, in, a, transmission, electron, microscope, may, require, processing, to, produce, a, suitable, sample, the, technique, required, varies, depending, on, the, specimen, and, the, analysis, required, in, their, most, common, configurations, electron, microscopes, produce, images, with, a, single, brightness, value, per, pixel, with, the, results, usually, rendered, in, greyscale, however, often, these, images, are, then, colourized, through, the, use, of, feature, detection, software, or, simply, by, hand, editing, using, a, graphics, editor, this, may, be, done, to, clarify, structure, or, for, aesthetic, effect, and, generally, does, not, add, new, information, about, the, specimen, electron, microscopes, are, now, frequently, used, in, more, complex, workflows, with, each, workflow, typically, using, multiple, technologies, to, enable, more, complex, and, or, more, quantitative, analyses, of, a, sample, a, few, examples, are, outlined, below, but, this, should, not, be, considered, an, exhaustive, list, the, choice, of, workflow, will, be, highly, dependent, on, the, application, and, the, requirements, of, the, corresponding, scientific, questions, such, as, resolution, volume, nature, of, the, target, molecule, etc, for, example, images, from, light, and, electron, microscopy, of, the, same, region, of, a, sample, can, be, overlaid, to, correlate, the, data, from, the, two, modalities, this, is, commonly, used, to, provide, higher, resolution, contextual, em, information, about, a, fluorescently, labelled, structure, this, correlative, light, and, electron, microscopy, clem, is, one, of, a, range, of, correlative, workflows, now, available, another, example, is, high, resolution, mass, spectrometry, ion, microscopy, which, has, been, used, to, provide, correlative, information, about, subcellular, antibiotic, localisation, data, that, would, be, difficult, to, obtain, by, other, means, the, initial, role, of, electron, microscopes, in, imaging, two, dimensional, slices, tem, or, a, specimen, surface, sem, with, secondary, electrons, has, also, increasingly, expanded, into, the, depth, of, samples, an, early, example, of, these, volume, em, workflows, was, simply, to, stack, tem, images, of, serial, sections, cut, through, a, sample, the, next, development, was, virtual, reconstruction, of, a, thick, section, 200, 500, nm, volume, by, backprojection, of, a, set, of, images, taken, at, different, tilt, angles, tem, tomography, to, acquire, volume, em, datasets, of, larger, depths, than, tem, tomography, micrometers, or, millimeters, in, the, z, axis, a, series, of, images, taken, through, the, sample, depth, can, be, used, for, example, ribbons, of, serial, sections, can, be, imaged, in, a, tem, as, described, above, and, when, thicker, sections, are, used, serial, tem, tomography, can, be, used, to, increase, the, z, resolution, more, recently, back, scattered, electron, bse, images, can, be, acquired, of, a, larger, series, of, sections, collected, on, silicon, wafers, known, as, sem, array, tomography, an, alternative, approach, is, to, use, bse, sem, to, image, the, block, surface, instead, of, the, section, after, each, section, has, been, removed, by, this, method, an, ultramicrotome, installed, in, an, sem, chamber, can, increase, automation, of, the, workflow, the, specimen, block, is, loaded, in, the, chamber, and, the, system, programmed, to, continuously, cut, and, image, through, the, sample, this, is, known, as, serial, block, face, sem, a, related, method, uses, focused, ion, beam, milling, instead, of, an, ultramicrotome, to, remove, sections, in, these, serial, imaging, methods, the, output, is, essentially, a, sequence, of, images, through, a, specimen, block, that, can, be, digitally, aligned, in, sequence, and, thus, reconstructed, into, a, volume, em, dataset, the, increased, volume, available, in, these, methods, has, expanded, the, capability, of, electron, microscopy, to, address, new, questions, such, as, mapping, neural, connectivity, in, the, brain, and, membrane, contact, sites, between, organelles, electron, microscopes, are, expensive, to, build, and, maintain, microscopes, designed, to, achieve, high, resolutions, must, be, housed, in, stable, buildings, sometimes, underground, with, special, services, such, as, magnetic, field, canceling, systems, the, samples, largely, have, to, be, viewed, in, vacuum, as, the, molecules, that, make, up, air, would, scatter, the, electrons, an, exception, is, liquid, phase, electron, microscopy, using, either, a, closed, liquid, cell, or, an, environmental, chamber, for, example, in, the, environmental, scanning, electron, microscope, which, allows, hydrated, samples, to, be, viewed, in, a, low, pressure, up, to, 20, torr, or, 2, 7, kpa, wet, environment, various, techniques, for, in, situ, electron, microscopy, of, gaseous, samples, have, been, developed, scanning, electron, microscopes, operating, in, conventional, high, vacuum, mode, usually, image, conductive, specimens, therefore, non, conductive, materials, require, conductive, coating, gold, palladium, alloy, carbon, osmium, etc, the, low, voltage, mode, of, modern, microscopes, makes, possible, the, observation, of, non, conductive, specimens, without, coating, non, conductive, materials, can, be, imaged, also, by, a, variable, pressure, or, environmental, scanning, electron, microscope, small, stable, specimens, such, as, carbon, nanotubes, diatom, frustules, and, small, mineral, crystals, asbestos, fibres, for, example, require, no, special, treatment, before, being, examined, in, the, electron, microscope, samples, of, hydrated, materials, including, almost, all, biological, specimens, have, to, be, prepared, in, various, ways, to, stabilize, them, reduce, their, thickness, ultrathin, sectioning, and, increase, their, electron, optical, contrast, staining, these, processes, may, result, in, artifacts, but, these, can, usually, be, identified, by, comparing, the, results, obtained, by, using, radically, different, specimen, preparation, methods, since, the, 1980s, analysis, of, cryofixed, vitrified, specimens, has, also, become, increasingly, used, by, scientists, further, confirming, the, validity, of, this, technique
