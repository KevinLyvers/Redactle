unix, j, u, n, k, s, yoo, niks, trademarked, as, unix, is, a, family, of, multitasking, multi, user, computer, operating, systems, that, derive, from, the, original, at, t, unix, whose, development, started, in, 1969, at, the, bell, labs, research, center, by, ken, thompson, dennis, ritchie, and, others, initially, intended, for, use, inside, the, bell, system, at, t, licensed, unix, to, outside, parties, in, the, late, 1970s, leading, to, a, variety, of, both, academic, and, commercial, unix, variants, from, vendors, including, university, of, california, berkeley, bsd, microsoft, xenix, sun, microsystems, sunos, solaris, hp, hpe, hp, ux, and, ibm, aix, in, the, early, 1990s, at, t, sold, its, rights, in, unix, to, novell, which, then, sold, the, unix, trademark, to, the, open, group, an, industry, consortium, founded, in, 1996, the, open, group, allows, the, use, of, the, mark, for, certified, operating, systems, that, comply, with, the, single, unix, specification, sus, early, versions, of, unix, ran, on, pdp, 11, computers, unix, systems, are, characterized, by, a, modular, design, that, is, sometimes, called, the, unix, philosophy, according, to, this, philosophy, the, operating, system, should, provide, a, set, of, simple, tools, each, of, which, performs, a, limited, well, defined, function, a, unified, and, inode, based, filesystem, and, an, inter, process, communication, mechanism, known, as, pipes, serve, as, the, main, means, of, communication, and, a, shell, scripting, and, command, language, the, unix, shell, is, used, to, combine, the, tools, to, perform, complex, workflows, unix, distinguishes, itself, from, its, predecessors, as, the, first, portable, operating, system, almost, the, entire, operating, system, is, written, in, the, c, programming, language, which, allows, unix, to, operate, on, numerous, platforms, unix, was, originally, meant, to, be, a, convenient, platform, for, programmers, developing, software, to, be, run, on, it, and, on, other, systems, rather, than, for, non, programmers, the, system, grew, larger, as, the, operating, system, started, spreading, in, academic, circles, and, as, users, added, their, own, tools, to, the, system, and, shared, them, with, colleagues, at, first, unix, was, not, designed, to, be, portable, or, for, multi, tasking, later, unix, gradually, gained, portability, multi, tasking, and, multi, user, capabilities, in, a, time, sharing, configuration, unix, systems, are, characterized, by, various, concepts, the, use, of, plain, text, for, storing, data, a, hierarchical, file, system, treating, devices, and, certain, types, of, inter, process, communication, ipc, as, files, and, the, use, of, a, large, number, of, software, tools, small, programs, that, can, be, strung, together, through, a, command, line, interpreter, using, pipes, as, opposed, to, using, a, single, monolithic, program, that, includes, all, of, the, same, functionality, these, concepts, are, collectively, known, as, the, unix, philosophy, brian, kernighan, and, rob, pike, summarize, this, in, the, unix, programming, environment, as, the, idea, that, the, power, of, a, system, comes, more, from, the, relationships, among, programs, than, from, the, programs, themselves, by, the, early, 1980s, users, began, seeing, unix, as, a, potential, universal, operating, system, suitable, for, computers, of, all, sizes, the, unix, environment, and, the, client, server, program, model, were, essential, elements, in, the, development, of, the, internet, and, the, reshaping, of, computing, as, centered, in, networks, rather, than, in, individual, computers, both, unix, and, the, c, programming, language, were, developed, by, at, t, and, distributed, to, government, and, academic, institutions, which, led, to, both, being, ported, to, a, wider, variety, of, machine, families, than, any, other, operating, system, the, unix, operating, system, consists, of, many, libraries, and, utilities, along, with, the, master, control, program, the, kernel, the, kernel, provides, services, to, start, and, stop, programs, handles, the, file, system, and, other, common, low, level, tasks, that, most, programs, share, and, schedules, access, to, avoid, conflicts, when, programs, try, to, access, the, same, resource, or, device, simultaneously, to, mediate, such, access, the, kernel, has, special, rights, reflected, in, the, distinction, of, kernel, space, from, user, space, the, latter, being, a, lower, priority, realm, where, most, application, programs, operate, the, origins, of, unix, date, back, to, the, mid, 1960s, when, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, bell, labs, and, general, electric, were, developing, multics, a, time, sharing, operating, system, for, the, ge, 645, mainframe, computer, multics, featured, several, innovations, but, also, presented, severe, problems, frustrated, by, the, size, and, complexity, of, multics, but, not, by, its, goals, individual, researchers, at, bell, labs, started, withdrawing, from, the, project, the, last, to, leave, were, ken, thompson, dennis, ritchie, douglas, mcilroy, and, joe, ossanna, who, decided, to, reimplement, their, experiences, in, a, new, project, of, smaller, scale, this, new, operating, system, was, initially, without, organizational, backing, and, also, without, a, name, the, new, operating, system, was, a, single, tasking, system, in, 1970, the, group, coined, the, name, unics, for, uniplexed, information, and, computing, service, as, a, pun, on, multics, which, stood, for, multiplexed, information, and, computer, services, brian, kernighan, takes, credit, for, the, idea, but, adds, that, no, one, can, remember, the, origin, of, the, final, spelling, unix, dennis, ritchie, doug, mcilroy, and, peter, g, neumann, also, credit, kernighan, the, operating, system, was, originally, written, in, assembly, language, but, in, 1973, version, 4, unix, was, rewritten, in, c, version, 4, unix, however, still, had, much, pdp, 11, specific, code, and, was, not, suitable, for, porting, the, first, port, to, another, platform, was, a, port, of, version, 6, made, four, years, later, 1977, at, the, university, of, wollongong, for, the, interdata, 7, 32, followed, by, a, bell, labs, port, of, version, 7, to, the, interdata, 8, 32, during, 1977, and, 1978, bell, labs, produced, several, versions, of, unix, that, are, collectively, referred, to, as, research, unix, in, 1975, the, first, source, license, for, unix, was, sold, to, donald, b, gillies, at, the, university, of, illinois, urbana, champaign, department, of, computer, science, uiuc, during, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, influence, of, unix, in, academic, circles, led, to, large, scale, adoption, of, unix, bsd, and, system, v, by, commercial, startups, which, in, turn, led, to, unix, fragmenting, into, multiple, similar, but, often, slightly, and, mutually, incompatible, systems, including, dynix, hp, ux, sunos, solaris, aix, and, xenix, in, the, late, 1980s, at, t, unix, system, laboratories, and, sun, microsystems, developed, system, v, release, 4, svr4, which, was, subsequently, adopted, by, many, commercial, unix, vendors, in, the, 1990s, unix, and, unix, like, systems, grew, in, popularity, and, became, the, operating, system, of, choice, for, over, 90, of, the, world, s, top, 500, fastest, supercomputers, as, bsd, and, linux, distributions, were, developed, through, collaboration, by, a, worldwide, network, of, programmers, in, 2000, apple, released, darwin, also, a, unix, system, which, became, the, core, of, the, mac, os, x, operating, system, later, renamed, macos, unix, like, operating, systems, are, widely, used, in, modern, servers, workstations, and, mobile, devices, in, the, late, 1980s, an, open, operating, system, standardization, effort, now, known, as, posix, provided, a, common, baseline, for, all, operating, systems, ieee, based, posix, around, the, common, structure, of, the, major, competing, variants, of, the, unix, system, publishing, the, first, posix, standard, in, 1988, in, the, early, 1990s, a, separate, but, very, similar, effort, was, started, by, an, industry, consortium, the, common, open, software, environment, cose, initiative, which, eventually, became, the, single, unix, specification, sus, administered, by, the, open, group, starting, in, 1998, the, open, group, and, ieee, started, the, austin, group, to, provide, a, common, definition, of, posix, and, the, single, unix, specification, which, by, 2008, had, become, the, open, group, base, specification, in, 1999, in, an, effort, towards, compatibility, several, unix, system, vendors, agreed, on, svr4, s, executable, and, linkable, format, elf, as, the, standard, for, binary, and, object, code, files, the, common, format, allows, substantial, binary, compatibility, among, different, unix, systems, operating, on, the, same, cpu, architecture, the, filesystem, hierarchy, standard, was, created, to, provide, a, reference, directory, layout, for, unix, like, operating, systems, it, has, mainly, been, used, in, linux, the, unix, system, is, composed, of, several, components, that, were, originally, packaged, together, by, including, the, development, environment, libraries, documents, and, the, portable, modifiable, source, code, for, all, of, these, components, in, addition, to, the, kernel, of, an, operating, system, unix, was, a, self, contained, software, system, this, was, one, of, the, key, reasons, it, emerged, as, an, important, teaching, and, learning, tool, and, has, had, a, broad, influence, the, inclusion, of, these, components, did, not, make, the, system, large, the, original, v7, unix, distribution, consisting, of, copies, of, all, of, the, compiled, binaries, plus, all, of, the, source, code, and, documentation, occupied, less, than, 10, mb, and, arrived, on, a, single, nine, track, magnetic, tape, earning, its, reputation, as, a, portable, system, the, printed, documentation, typeset, from, the, online, sources, was, contained, in, two, volumes, the, names, and, filesystem, locations, of, the, unix, components, have, changed, substantially, across, the, history, of, the, system, nonetheless, the, v7, implementation, is, considered, by, many, to, have, the, canonical, early, structure, the, unix, system, had, a, significant, impact, on, other, operating, systems, it, achieved, its, reputation, by, its, interactivity, by, providing, the, software, at, a, nominal, fee, for, educational, use, by, running, on, inexpensive, hardware, and, by, being, easy, to, adapt, and, move, to, different, machines, unix, was, originally, written, in, assembly, language, but, was, soon, rewritten, in, c, a, high, level, programming, language, although, this, followed, the, lead, of, ctss, multics, and, burroughs, mcp, it, was, unix, that, popularized, the, idea, unix, had, a, drastically, simplified, file, model, compared, to, many, contemporary, operating, systems, treating, all, kinds, of, files, as, simple, byte, arrays, the, file, system, hierarchy, contained, machine, services, and, devices, such, as, printers, terminals, or, disk, drives, providing, a, uniform, interface, but, at, the, expense, of, occasionally, requiring, additional, mechanisms, such, as, ioctl, and, mode, flags, to, access, features, of, the, hardware, that, did, not, fit, the, simple, stream, of, bytes, model, the, plan, 9, operating, system, pushed, this, model, even, further, and, eliminated, the, need, for, additional, mechanisms, unix, also, popularized, the, hierarchical, file, system, with, arbitrarily, nested, subdirectories, originally, introduced, by, multics, other, common, operating, systems, of, the, era, had, ways, to, divide, a, storage, device, into, multiple, directories, or, sections, but, they, had, a, fixed, number, of, levels, often, only, one, level, several, major, proprietary, operating, systems, eventually, added, recursive, subdirectory, capabilities, also, patterned, after, multics, dec, s, rsx, 11m, s, group, user, hierarchy, evolved, into, openvms, directories, cp, m, s, volumes, evolved, into, ms, dos, 2, 0, subdirectories, and, hp, s, mpe, group, account, hierarchy, and, ibm, s, ssp, and, os, 400, library, systems, were, folded, into, broader, posix, file, systems, making, the, command, interpreter, an, ordinary, user, level, program, with, additional, commands, provided, as, separate, programs, was, another, multics, innovation, popularized, by, unix, the, unix, shell, used, the, same, language, for, interactive, commands, as, for, scripting, shell, scripts, there, was, no, separate, job, control, language, like, ibm, s, jcl, since, the, shell, and, os, commands, were, just, another, program, the, user, could, choose, or, even, write, their, own, shell, new, commands, could, be, added, without, changing, the, shell, itself, unix, s, innovative, command, line, syntax, for, creating, modular, chains, of, producer, consumer, processes, pipelines, made, a, powerful, programming, paradigm, coroutines, widely, available, many, later, command, line, interpreters, have, been, inspired, by, the, unix, shell, a, fundamental, simplifying, assumption, of, unix, was, its, focus, on, newline, delimited, text, for, nearly, all, file, formats, there, were, no, binary, editors, in, the, original, version, of, unix, the, entire, system, was, configured, using, textual, shell, command, scripts, the, common, denominator, in, the, i, o, system, was, the, byte, unlike, record, based, file, systems, the, focus, on, text, for, representing, nearly, everything, made, unix, pipes, especially, useful, and, encouraged, the, development, of, simple, general, tools, that, could, easily, be, combined, to, perform, more, complicated, ad, hoc, tasks, the, focus, on, text, and, bytes, made, the, system, far, more, scalable, and, portable, than, other, systems, over, time, text, based, applications, have, also, proven, popular, in, application, areas, such, as, printing, languages, postscript, odf, and, at, the, application, layer, of, the, internet, protocols, e, g, ftp, smtp, http, soap, and, sip, unix, popularized, a, syntax, for, regular, expressions, that, found, widespread, use, the, unix, programming, interface, became, the, basis, for, a, widely, implemented, operating, system, interface, standard, posix, see, above, the, c, programming, language, soon, spread, beyond, unix, and, is, now, ubiquitous, in, systems, and, applications, programming, early, unix, developers, were, important, in, bringing, the, concepts, of, modularity, and, reusability, into, software, engineering, practice, spawning, a, software, tools, movement, over, time, the, leading, developers, of, unix, and, programs, that, ran, on, it, established, a, set, of, cultural, norms, for, developing, software, norms, which, became, as, important, and, influential, as, the, technology, of, unix, itself, this, has, been, termed, the, unix, philosophy, the, tcp, ip, networking, protocols, were, quickly, implemented, on, the, unix, versions, widely, used, on, relatively, inexpensive, computers, which, contributed, to, the, internet, explosion, of, worldwide, real, time, connectivity, and, formed, the, basis, for, implementations, on, many, other, platforms, the, unix, policy, of, extensive, on, line, documentation, and, for, many, years, ready, access, to, all, system, source, code, raised, programmer, expectations, and, contributed, to, the, launch, of, the, free, software, movement, in, 1983, in, 1983, richard, stallman, announced, the, gnu, short, for, gnu, s, not, unix, project, an, ambitious, effort, to, create, a, free, software, unix, like, system, free, in, the, sense, that, everyone, who, received, a, copy, would, be, free, to, use, study, modify, and, redistribute, it, the, gnu, project, s, own, kernel, development, project, gnu, hurd, had, not, yet, produced, a, working, kernel, but, in, 1991, linus, torvalds, released, the, linux, kernel, as, free, software, under, the, gnu, general, public, license, in, addition, to, their, use, in, the, gnu, operating, system, many, gnu, packages, such, as, the, gnu, compiler, collection, and, the, rest, of, the, gnu, toolchain, the, gnu, c, library, and, the, gnu, core, utilities, have, gone, on, to, play, central, roles, in, other, free, unix, systems, as, well, linux, distributions, consisting, of, the, linux, kernel, and, large, collections, of, compatible, software, have, become, popular, both, with, individual, users, and, in, business, popular, distributions, include, red, hat, enterprise, linux, fedora, suse, linux, enterprise, opensuse, debian, ubuntu, linux, mint, slackware, linux, arch, linux, and, gentoo, a, free, derivative, of, bsd, unix, 386bsd, was, released, in, 1992, and, led, to, the, netbsd, and, freebsd, projects, with, the, 1994, settlement, of, a, lawsuit, brought, against, the, university, of, california, and, berkeley, software, design, inc, usl, v, bsdi, by, unix, system, laboratories, it, was, clarified, that, berkeley, had, the, right, to, distribute, bsd, unix, for, free, if, it, so, desired, since, then, bsd, unix, has, been, developed, in, several, different, product, branches, including, openbsd, and, dragonfly, bsd, linux, and, bsd, unix, are, increasingly, filling, the, market, needs, traditionally, served, by, proprietary, unix, operating, systems, as, well, as, expanding, into, new, markets, such, as, the, consumer, desktop, and, mobile, and, embedded, devices, because, of, the, modular, design, of, the, unix, model, sharing, components, is, relatively, common, most, or, all, unix, and, unix, like, systems, include, at, least, some, bsd, code, while, some, include, gnu, utilities, in, their, distributions, in, a, 1999, interview, dennis, ritchie, voiced, his, opinion, that, linux, and, bsd, unix, operating, systems, are, a, continuation, of, the, basis, of, the, unix, design, and, are, derivatives, of, unix, i, think, the, linux, phenomenon, is, quite, delightful, because, it, draws, so, strongly, on, the, basis, that, unix, provided, linux, seems, to, be, among, the, healthiest, of, the, direct, unix, derivatives, though, there, are, also, the, various, bsd, systems, as, well, as, the, more, official, offerings, from, the, workstation, and, mainframe, manufacturers, in, the, same, interview, he, states, that, he, views, both, unix, and, linux, as, the, continuation, of, ideas, that, were, started, by, ken, and, me, and, many, others, many, years, ago, opensolaris, was, the, free, software, counterpart, to, solaris, developed, by, sun, microsystems, which, included, a, cddl, licensed, kernel, and, a, primarily, gnu, userland, however, oracle, discontinued, the, project, upon, their, acquisition, of, sun, which, prompted, a, group, of, former, sun, employees, and, members, of, the, opensolaris, community, to, fork, opensolaris, into, the, illumos, kernel, as, of, 2014, illumos, remains, the, only, active, open, source, system, v, derivative, in, may, 1975, rfc, 681, described, the, development, of, network, unix, by, the, center, for, advanced, computation, at, the, university, of, illinois, urbana, champaign, the, unix, system, was, said, to, present, several, interesting, capabilities, as, an, arpanet, mini, host, at, the, time, unix, required, a, license, from, bell, telephone, laboratories, that, cost, us, 20, 000, for, non, university, institutions, while, universities, could, obtain, a, license, for, a, nominal, fee, of, 150, it, was, noted, that, bell, was, open, to, suggestions, for, an, arpanet, wide, license, the, rfc, specifically, mentions, that, unix, offers, powerful, local, processing, facilities, in, terms, of, user, programs, several, compilers, an, editor, based, on, qed, a, versatile, document, preparation, system, and, an, efficient, file, system, featuring, sophisticated, access, control, mountable, and, de, mountable, volumes, and, a, unified, treatment, of, peripherals, as, special, files, the, latter, permitted, the, network, control, program, ncp, to, be, integrated, within, the, unix, file, system, treating, network, connections, as, special, files, that, could, be, accessed, through, standard, unix, i, o, calls, which, included, the, added, benefit, of, closing, all, connections, on, program, exit, should, the, user, neglect, to, do, so, in, order, to, minimize, the, amount, of, code, added, to, the, basic, unix, kernel, much, of, the, ncp, code, ran, in, a, swappable, user, process, running, only, when, needed, in, october, 1993, novell, the, company, that, owned, the, rights, to, the, unix, system, v, source, at, the, time, transferred, the, trademarks, of, unix, to, the, x, open, company, now, the, open, group, and, in, 1995, sold, the, related, business, operations, to, santa, cruz, operation, sco, whether, novell, also, sold, the, copyrights, to, the, actual, software, was, the, subject, of, a, federal, lawsuit, in, 2006, sco, v, novell, which, novell, won, the, case, was, appealed, but, on, august, 30, 2011, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, tenth, circuit, affirmed, the, trial, decisions, closing, the, case, unix, vendor, sco, group, inc, accused, novell, of, slander, of, title, the, present, owner, of, the, trademark, unix, is, the, open, group, an, industry, standards, consortium, only, systems, fully, compliant, with, and, certified, to, the, single, unix, specification, qualify, as, unix, others, are, called, unix, like, by, decree, of, the, open, group, the, term, unix, refers, more, to, a, class, of, operating, systems, than, to, a, specific, implementation, of, an, operating, system, those, operating, systems, which, meet, the, open, group, s, single, unix, specification, should, be, able, to, bear, the, unix, 98, or, unix, 03, trademarks, today, after, the, operating, system, s, vendor, pays, a, substantial, certification, fee, and, annual, trademark, royalties, to, the, open, group, systems, that, have, been, licensed, to, use, the, unix, trademark, include, aix, euleros, hp, ux, inspur, k, ux, irix, macos, solaris, tru64, unix, formerly, digital, unix, or, osf, 1, and, z, os, notably, euleros, and, inspur, k, ux, are, linux, distributions, certified, as, unix, 03, compliant, sometimes, a, representation, like, un, x, nix, or, n, x, is, used, to, indicate, all, operating, systems, similar, to, unix, this, comes, from, the, use, of, the, asterisk, and, the, question, mark, characters, as, wildcard, indicators, in, many, utilities, this, notation, is, also, used, to, describe, other, unix, like, systems, that, have, not, met, the, requirements, for, unix, branding, from, the, open, group, the, open, group, requests, that, unix, always, be, used, as, an, adjective, followed, by, a, generic, term, such, as, system, to, help, avoid, the, creation, of, a, genericized, trademark, unix, was, the, original, formatting, but, the, usage, of, unix, remains, widespread, because, it, was, once, typeset, in, small, caps, unix, according, to, dennis, ritchie, when, presenting, the, original, unix, paper, to, the, third, operating, systems, symposium, of, the, american, association, for, computing, machinery, acm, we, had, a, new, typesetter, and, troff, had, just, been, invented, and, we, were, intoxicated, by, being, able, to, produce, small, caps, many, of, the, operating, system, s, predecessors, and, contemporaries, used, all, uppercase, lettering, so, many, people, wrote, the, name, in, upper, case, due, to, force, of, habit, it, is, not, an, acronym, trademark, names, can, be, registered, by, different, entities, in, different, countries, and, trademark, laws, in, some, countries, allow, the, same, trademark, name, to, be, controlled, by, two, different, entities, if, each, entity, uses, the, trademark, in, easily, distinguishable, categories, the, result, is, that, unix, has, been, used, as, a, brand, name, for, various, products, including, bookshelves, ink, pens, bottled, glue, diapers, hair, driers, and, food, containers, several, plural, forms, of, unix, are, used, casually, to, refer, to, multiple, brands, of, unix, and, unix, like, systems, most, common, is, the, conventional, unixes, but, unices, treating, unix, as, a, latin, noun, of, the, third, declension, is, also, popular, the, pseudo, anglo, saxon, plural, form, unixen, is, not, common, although, occasionally, seen, sun, microsystems, developer, of, the, solaris, variant, has, asserted, that, the, term, unix, is, itself, plural, referencing, its, many, implementations
