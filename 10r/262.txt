in, metalworking, rolling, is, a, metal, forming, process, in, which, metal, stock, is, passed, through, one, or, more, pairs, of, rolls, to, reduce, the, thickness, to, make, the, thickness, uniform, and, or, to, impart, a, desired, mechanical, property, the, concept, is, similar, to, the, rolling, of, dough, rolling, is, classified, according, to, the, temperature, of, the, metal, rolled, if, the, temperature, of, the, metal, is, above, its, recrystallization, temperature, then, the, process, is, known, as, hot, rolling, if, the, temperature, of, the, metal, is, below, its, recrystallization, temperature, the, process, is, known, as, cold, rolling, in, terms, of, usage, hot, rolling, processes, more, tonnage, than, any, other, manufacturing, process, and, cold, rolling, processes, the, most, tonnage, out, of, all, cold, working, processes, roll, stands, holding, pairs, of, rolls, are, grouped, together, into, rolling, mills, that, can, quickly, process, metal, typically, steel, into, products, such, as, structural, steel, i, beams, angle, stock, channel, stock, bar, stock, and, rails, most, steel, mills, have, rolling, mill, divisions, that, convert, the, semi, finished, casting, products, into, finished, products, there, are, many, types, of, rolling, processes, including, ring, rolling, roll, bending, roll, forming, profile, rolling, and, controlled, rolling, the, earliest, rolling, mills, in, crude, form, but, the, same, basic, principles, were, found, in, middle, east, and, south, asia, as, early, as, 600, bce, the, invention, of, the, rolling, mill, in, europe, may, be, attributed, to, leonardo, da, vinci, in, his, drawings, earliest, rolling, mills, were, slitting, mills, which, were, introduced, from, what, is, now, belgium, to, england, in, 1590, these, passed, flat, bars, between, rolls, to, form, a, plate, of, iron, which, was, then, passed, between, grooved, rolls, slitters, to, produce, rods, of, iron, the, first, experiments, at, rolling, iron, for, tinplate, took, place, about, 1670, in, 1697, major, john, hanbury, erected, a, mill, at, pontypool, to, roll, pontypool, plates, blackplate, later, this, began, to, be, rerolled, and, tinned, to, make, tinplate, the, earlier, production, of, plate, iron, in, europe, had, been, in, forges, not, rolling, mills, the, slitting, mill, was, adapted, to, producing, hoops, for, barrels, and, iron, with, a, half, round, or, other, sections, by, means, that, were, the, subject, of, two, patents, of, c, 1679, some, of, the, earliest, literature, on, rolling, mills, can, be, traced, back, to, the, swedish, engineer, christopher, polhem, in, his, patriotista, testamente, of, 1761, where, he, mentions, rolling, mills, for, both, plate, and, bar, iron, he, also, explains, how, rolling, mills, can, save, on, time, and, labor, because, a, rolling, mill, can, produce, 10, to, 20, or, more, bars, at, the, same, time, a, patent, was, granted, to, thomas, blockley, of, england, in, 1759, for, the, polishing, and, rolling, of, metals, another, patent, was, granted, in, 1766, to, richard, ford, of, england, for, the, first, tandem, mill, a, tandem, mill, is, one, in, which, the, metal, is, rolled, in, successive, stands, ford, s, tandem, mill, was, for, hot, rolling, of, wire, rods, rolling, mills, for, lead, seem, to, have, existed, by, the, late, 17th, century, copper, and, brass, were, also, rolled, by, the, late, 18th, century, until, well, into, the, eighteenth, century, rolling, mills, derived, their, power, from, water, wheels, the, first, recorded, use, of, a, steam, engine, directly, driving, a, mill, is, attributed, to, john, wilkinson, s, bradley, works, where, in, 1786, a, boulton, and, watt, engine, was, coupled, to, a, slitting, and, rolling, mill, the, use, of, steam, engines, considerably, enhanced, the, production, capabilities, of, the, mills, until, this, form, of, power, was, displaced, by, electric, motors, soon, after, 1900, modern, rolling, practice, can, be, attributed, to, the, pioneering, efforts, of, henry, cort, of, funtley, iron, mills, near, fareham, in, hampshire, england, in, 1783, a, patent, number, was, issued, to, henry, cort, for, his, use, of, grooved, rolls, for, rolling, iron, bars, with, this, new, design, mills, were, able, to, produce, 15, times, more, output, per, day, than, with, a, hammer, although, cort, was, not, the, first, to, use, grooved, rolls, he, was, the, first, to, combine, the, use, of, many, of, the, best, features, of, various, ironmaking, and, shaping, processes, known, at, the, time, thus, modern, writers, have, called, him, father, of, modern, rolling, the, first, rail, rolling, mill, was, established, by, john, birkenshaw, at, bedlington, ironworks, in, northumberland, england, in, 1820, where, he, produced, fish, bellied, wrought, iron, rails, in, lengths, of, 15, to, 18, feet, with, the, advancement, of, technology, in, rolling, mills, the, size, of, rolling, mills, grew, rapidly, along, with, the, size, of, the, products, being, rolled, one, example, of, this, was, at, the, great, exhibition, in, london, in, 1851, where, a, plate, 20, feet, long, 3, 1, 2, feet, wide, and, 7, 16, of, an, inch, thick, and, weighing, 1, 125, pounds, was, exhibited, by, the, consett, iron, company, further, evolution, of, the, rolling, mill, came, with, the, introduction, of, three, high, mills, in, 1853, used, for, rolling, heavy, sections, hot, rolling, is, a, metalworking, process, that, occurs, above, the, recrystallization, temperature, of, the, material, after, the, grains, deform, during, processing, they, recrystallize, which, maintains, an, equiaxed, microstructure, and, prevents, the, metal, from, work, hardening, the, starting, material, is, usually, large, pieces, of, metal, like, semi, finished, casting, products, such, as, ingots, slabs, blooms, and, billets, if, these, products, came, from, a, continuous, casting, operation, the, products, are, usually, fed, directly, into, the, rolling, mills, at, the, proper, temperature, in, smaller, operations, the, material, starts, at, room, temperature, and, must, be, heated, this, is, done, in, a, gas, or, oil, fired, soaking, pit, for, larger, workpieces, for, smaller, workpieces, induction, heating, is, used, as, the, material, is, worked, the, temperature, must, be, monitored, to, make, sure, it, remains, above, the, recrystallization, temperature, to, maintain, a, safety, factor, a, finishing, temperature, is, defined, above, the, recrystallization, temperature, this, is, usually, 50, to, 100, c, 122, to, 212, f, above, the, recrystallization, temperature, if, the, temperature, does, drop, below, this, temperature, the, material, must, be, re, heated, prior, to, additional, hot, rolling, hot, rolled, metals, generally, have, little, directionality, in, their, mechanical, properties, or, deformation, induced, residual, stresses, however, in, certain, instances, non, metallic, inclusions, will, impart, some, directionality, and, workpieces, less, than, 20, mm, 0, 79, in, thick, often, have, some, directional, properties, non, uniform, cooling, will, induce, a, lot, of, residual, stresses, which, usually, occurs, in, shapes, that, have, a, non, uniform, cross, section, such, as, i, beams, while, the, finished, product, is, of, good, quality, the, surface, is, covered, in, mill, scale, which, is, an, oxide, that, forms, at, high, temperatures, it, is, usually, removed, via, pickling, or, the, smooth, clean, surface, scs, process, which, reveals, a, smooth, surface, dimensional, tolerances, are, usually, 2, to, 5, of, the, overall, dimension, hot, rolled, mild, steel, seems, to, have, a, wider, tolerance, for, the, level, of, included, carbon, than, does, cold, rolled, steel, and, is, therefore, more, difficult, for, a, blacksmith, to, use, hot, rolling, is, used, mainly, to, produce, sheet, metal, or, simple, cross, sections, such, as, rail, tracks, rolling, mills, are, often, divided, into, roughing, intermediate, and, finishing, rolling, cages, during, shape, rolling, an, initial, billet, round, or, square, with, edge, of, diameter, typically, ranging, between, 100, and, 140, mm, is, continuously, deformed, to, produce, a, certain, finished, product, with, smaller, cross, section, dimension, and, geometry, starting, from, a, given, billet, different, sequences, can, be, adopted, to, produce, a, certain, final, product, however, since, each, rolling, mill, is, significantly, expensive, up, to, 2, million, euros, a, typical, requirement, is, to, reduce, the, number, of, rolling, passes, different, approaches, have, been, achieved, including, empirical, knowledge, employment, of, numerical, models, and, artificial, intelligence, techniques, lambiase, et, al, validated, a, finite, element, model, fe, for, predicting, the, final, shape, of, a, rolled, bar, in, round, flat, pass, one, of, the, major, concerns, when, designing, rolling, mills, is, to, reduce, the, number, of, passes, a, possible, solution, to, such, requirements, is, the, slit, pass, also, called, split, pass, which, divides, an, incoming, bar, in, two, or, more, subparts, thus, virtually, increasing, the, cross, section, reduction, ratio, per, pass, as, reported, by, lambiase, another, solution, for, reducing, the, number, of, passes, in, rolling, mills, is, the, employment, of, automated, systems, for, roll, pass, design, as, that, proposed, by, lambiase, and, langella, subsequently, lambiase, further, developed, an, automated, system, based, on, artificial, intelligence, and, particularly, an, integrated, system, including, an, inferential, engine, based, on, genetic, algorithms, a, knowledge, database, based, on, an, artificial, neural, network, trained, by, a, parametric, finite, element, model, and, to, optimize, and, automatically, design, rolling, mills, cold, rolling, occurs, with, the, metal, below, its, recrystallization, temperature, usually, at, room, temperature, which, increases, the, strength, via, strain, hardening, up, to, 20, it, also, improves, the, surface, finish, and, holds, tighter, tolerances, commonly, cold, rolled, products, include, sheets, strips, bars, and, rods, these, products, are, usually, smaller, than, the, same, products, that, are, hot, rolled, because, of, the, smaller, size, of, the, workpieces, and, their, greater, strength, as, compared, to, hot, rolled, stock, four, high, or, cluster, mills, are, used, cold, rolling, cannot, reduce, the, thickness, of, a, workpiece, as, much, as, hot, rolling, in, a, single, pass, cold, rolled, sheets, and, strips, come, in, various, conditions, full, hard, half, hard, quarter, hard, and, skin, rolled, full, hard, rolling, reduces, the, thickness, by, 50, while, the, others, involve, less, of, a, reduction, cold, rolled, steel, is, then, annealed, to, induce, ductility, in, the, cold, rolled, steel, which, is, simply, known, as, a, cold, rolled, and, close, annealed, skin, rolling, also, known, as, a, skin, pass, involves, the, least, amount, of, reduction, 0, 5, 1, it, is, used, to, produce, a, smooth, surface, a, uniform, thickness, and, reduce, the, yield, point, phenomenon, by, preventing, l, ders, bands, from, forming, in, later, processing, it, locks, dislocations, at, the, surface, and, thereby, reduces, the, possibility, of, formation, of, l, ders, bands, to, avoid, the, formation, of, l, ders, bands, it, is, necessary, to, create, substantial, density, of, unpinned, dislocations, in, ferrite, matrix, it, is, also, used, to, break, up, the, spangles, in, galvanized, steel, skin, rolled, stock, is, usually, used, in, subsequent, cold, working, processes, where, good, ductility, is, required, other, shapes, can, be, cold, rolled, if, the, cross, section, is, relatively, uniform, and, the, transverse, dimension, is, relatively, small, cold, rolling, shapes, requires, a, series, of, shaping, operations, usually, along, the, lines, of, sizing, breakdown, roughing, semi, roughing, semi, finishing, and, finishing, if, processed, by, a, blacksmith, the, smoother, more, consistent, and, lower, levels, of, carbon, encapsulated, in, the, steel, makes, it, easier, to, process, but, at, the, cost, of, being, more, expensive, roll, bending, produces, a, cylindrical, shaped, product, from, plate, or, steel, metals, roll, forming, roll, bending, or, plate, rolling, is, a, continuous, bending, operation, in, which, a, long, strip, of, metal, typically, coiled, steel, is, passed, through, consecutive, sets, of, rolls, or, stands, each, performing, only, an, incremental, part, of, the, bend, until, the, desired, cross, section, profile, is, obtained, roll, forming, is, ideal, for, producing, parts, with, long, lengths, or, in, large, quantities, there, are, three, main, processes, 4, rollers, 3, rollers, and, 2, rollers, each, of, which, has, as, different, advantages, according, to, the, desired, specifications, of, the, output, plate, flat, rolling, is, the, most, basic, form, of, rolling, with, the, starting, and, ending, material, having, a, rectangular, cross, section, the, material, is, fed, in, between, two, rollers, called, working, rolls, that, rotate, in, opposite, directions, the, gap, between, the, two, rolls, is, less, than, the, thickness, of, the, starting, material, which, causes, it, to, deform, the, decrease, in, material, thickness, causes, the, material, to, elongate, the, friction, at, the, interface, between, the, material, and, the, rolls, causes, the, material, to, be, pushed, through, the, amount, of, deformation, possible, in, a, single, pass, is, limited, by, the, friction, between, the, rolls, if, the, change, in, thickness, is, too, great, the, rolls, just, slip, over, the, material, and, do, not, draw, it, in, the, final, product, is, either, sheet, or, plate, with, the, former, being, less, than, 6, mm, 0, 24, in, thick, and, the, latter, greater, than, however, heavy, plates, tend, to, be, formed, using, a, press, which, is, termed, forging, rather, than, rolling, often, the, rolls, are, heated, to, assist, in, the, workability, of, the, metal, lubrication, is, often, used, to, keep, the, workpiece, from, sticking, to, the, rolls, to, fine, tune, the, process, the, speed, of, the, rolls, and, the, temperature, of, the, rollers, are, adjusted, for, thin, sheet, metal, with, a, thickness, less, than, 200, m, 0, 0079, in, the, rolling, is, done, in, a, cluster, mill, because, the, small, thickness, requires, a, small, diameter, rolls, to, reduce, the, need, for, small, rolls, pack, rolling, is, used, which, rolls, multiple, sheets, together, to, increase, the, effective, starting, thickness, as, the, foil, sheets, come, through, the, rollers, they, are, trimmed, and, slitted, with, circular, or, razor, like, knives, trimming, refers, to, the, edges, of, the, foil, while, slitting, involves, cutting, it, into, several, sheets, aluminum, foil, is, the, most, commonly, produced, product, via, pack, rolling, this, is, evident, from, the, two, different, surface, finishes, the, shiny, side, is, on, the, roll, side, and, the, dull, side, is, against, the, other, sheet, of, foil, ring, rolling, is, a, specialized, type, of, hot, rolling, that, increases, the, diameter, of, a, ring, the, starting, material, is, a, thick, walled, ring, this, workpiece, is, placed, between, two, rolls, an, inner, idler, roll, and, a, driven, roll, which, presses, the, ring, from, the, outside, as, the, rolling, occurs, the, wall, thickness, decreases, as, the, diameter, increases, the, rolls, may, be, shaped, to, form, various, cross, sectional, shapes, the, resulting, grain, structure, is, circumferential, which, gives, better, mechanical, properties, diameters, can, be, as, large, as, 8, m, 26, ft, and, face, heights, as, tall, as, 2, m, 79, in, common, applications, include, railway, tyres, bearings, gears, rockets, turbines, airplanes, pipes, and, pressure, vessels, controlled, rolling, is, a, type, of, thermomechanical, processing, which, integrates, controlled, deformation, and, heat, treating, the, heat, which, brings, the, workpiece, above, the, recrystallization, temperature, is, also, used, to, perform, the, heat, treatments, so, that, any, subsequent, heat, treating, is, unnecessary, types, of, heat, treatments, include, the, production, of, a, fine, grain, structure, controlling, the, nature, size, and, distribution, of, various, transformation, products, such, as, ferrite, austenite, pearlite, bainite, and, martensite, in, steel, inducing, precipitation, hardening, and, controlling, the, toughness, in, order, to, achieve, this, the, entire, process, must, be, closely, monitored, and, controlled, common, variables, in, controlled, rolling, include, the, starting, material, composition, and, structure, deformation, levels, temperatures, at, various, stages, and, cool, down, conditions, the, benefits, of, controlled, rolling, include, better, mechanical, properties, and, energy, savings, forge, rolling, is, a, longitudinal, rolling, process, to, reduce, the, cross, sectional, area, of, heated, bars, or, billets, by, leading, them, between, two, contrary, rotating, roll, segments, the, process, is, mainly, used, to, provide, optimized, material, distribution, for, subsequent, die, forging, processes, owing, to, this, a, better, material, utilization, lower, process, forces, and, better, surface, quality, of, parts, can, be, achieved, in, die, forging, processes, basically, any, forgeable, metal, can, also, be, forge, rolled, forge, rolling, is, mainly, used, to, preform, long, scaled, billets, through, targeted, mass, distribution, for, parts, such, as, crankshafts, connection, rods, steering, knuckles, and, vehicle, axles, narrowest, manufacturing, tolerances, can, only, partially, be, achieved, by, forge, rolling, this, is, the, main, reason, why, forge, rolling, is, rarely, used, for, finishing, but, mainly, for, preforming, characteristics, of, forge, rolling, a, rolling, mill, also, known, as, a, reduction, mill, or, mill, has, a, common, construction, independent, of, the, specific, type, of, rolling, being, performed, slabs, are, the, feed, material, for, hot, strip, mills, or, plate, mills, and, blooms, are, rolled, to, billets, in, a, billet, mill, or, large, sections, in, a, structural, mill, the, output, from, a, strip, mill, is, coiled, and, subsequently, used, as, the, feed, for, a, cold, rolling, mill, or, used, directly, by, fabricators, billets, for, re, rolling, are, subsequently, rolled, in, either, a, merchant, bar, or, rod, mill, merchant, or, bar, mills, produce, a, variety, of, shaped, products, such, as, angles, channels, beams, rounds, long, or, coiled, and, hexagons, mills, are, designed, in, different, types, of, configurations, with, the, most, basic, being, a, two, high, non, reversing, which, means, there, are, two, rolls, that, only, turn, in, one, direction, the, two, high, reversing, mill, has, rolls, that, can, rotate, in, both, directions, but, the, disadvantage, is, that, the, rolls, must, be, stopped, reversed, and, then, brought, back, up, to, rolling, speed, between, each, pass, to, resolve, this, the, three, high, mill, was, invented, which, uses, three, rolls, that, rotate, in, one, direction, the, metal, is, fed, through, two, of, the, rolls, and, then, returned, through, the, other, pair, the, disadvantage, to, this, system, is, the, workpiece, must, be, lifted, and, lowered, using, an, elevator, all, of, these, mills, are, usually, used, for, primary, rolling, and, the, roll, diameters, range, from, 60, to, 140, cm, 24, to, 55, in, to, minimize, the, roll, diameter, a, four, high, or, cluster, mill, is, used, a, small, roll, diameter, is, advantageous, because, less, roll, is, in, contact, with, the, material, which, results, in, a, lower, force, and, power, requirement, the, problem, with, a, small, roll, is, a, reduction, of, stiffness, which, is, overcome, using, backup, rolls, these, backup, rolls, are, larger, and, contact, the, back, side, of, the, smaller, rolls, a, four, high, mill, has, four, rolls, two, small, and, two, large, a, cluster, mill, has, more, than, four, rolls, usually, in, three, tiers, these, types, of, mills, are, commonly, used, to, hot, roll, wide, plates, most, cold, rolling, applications, and, to, roll, foils, historically, mills, were, classified, by, the, product, produced, a, tandem, mill, is, a, special, type, of, modern, rolling, mill, where, rolling, is, done, in, one, pass, in, a, traditional, rolling, mill, rolling, is, done, in, several, passes, but, in, tandem, mill, there, are, several, stands, 2, stands, and, reductions, take, place, successively, the, number, of, stands, ranges, from, 2, to, 18, tandem, mills, can, be, either, of, hot, or, cold, rolling, mill, types, cold, rolling, mills, may, be, further, divided, into, continuous, or, batch, processing, a, continuous, mill, has, a, looping, tower, which, allows, the, mill, to, continue, rolling, slowly, the, strip, in, the, tower, while, a, strip, welder, joins, the, tail, of, the, current, coil, to, the, head, of, the, next, coil, at, the, exit, end, of, the, mill, there, is, normally, a, flying, shear, to, cut, the, strip, at, or, near, the, weld, followed, by, two, coilers, one, being, unloaded, while, the, other, winds, on, the, current, coil, looping, towers, are, also, used, in, other, places, such, as, continuous, annealing, lines, and, continuous, electrolytic, tinning, and, continuous, galvanising, lines, in, hot, rolling, if, the, temperature, of, the, workpiece, is, not, uniform, the, flow, of, the, material, will, occur, more, in, the, warmer, parts, and, less, in, the, cooler, if, the, temperature, difference, is, great, enough, cracking, and, tearing, can, occur, the, cooler, sections, are, among, other, things, a, result, of, the, supports, in, the, re, heat, furnace, when, cold, rolling, virtually, all, of, the, strip, thickness, variation, is, the, result, of, the, eccentricity, and, out, of, roundness, of, the, back, up, rolls, from, about, stand, 3, of, the, hot, strip, mill, through, to, the, finished, product, the, back, up, roll, eccentricity, can, be, up, to, 100, m, in, magnitude, per, stack, the, eccentricity, can, be, measured, off, line, by, plotting, the, force, variation, against, time, with, the, mill, on, creep, no, strip, present, and, the, mill, stand, below, face, a, modified, fourier, analysis, was, employed, by, the, 5, stand, cold, mill, at, bluescope, steel, port, kembla, from, 1986, until, that, cold, mill, ceased, production, in, 2009, within, each, coil, the, exit, thickness, deviation, times, 10, for, every, meter, of, strip, was, stored, in, a, file, this, file, was, analyzed, separately, for, each, frequency, wavelength, from, 5, m, to, 60, m, in, steps, of, 0, 1, m, to, improve, the, accuracy, care, was, taken, to, use, a, full, multiple, of, each, wavelength, 100, the, calculate, amplitudes, were, plotted, against, the, wavelength, so, that, the, spikes, could, be, compared, to, the, expected, wavelengths, created, by, the, backup, rolls, of, each, stand, if, a, mill, stand, is, fitted, with, hydraulic, pistons, in, series, with, or, instead, of, the, electrically, driven, mechanical, screws, then, it, is, possible, to, eliminate, the, effect, of, that, stands, back, up, roll, eccentricity, while, rolling, the, eccentricity, of, each, back, up, roll, is, determined, by, sampling, the, roll, force, and, assigning, it, to, the, corresponding, portion, of, each, back, up, roll, s, rotational, position, these, recordings, are, then, used, to, operate, the, hydraulic, piston, so, as, to, neutralize, the, eccentricities, in, a, flat, metal, workpiece, the, flatness, is, a, descriptive, attribute, characterizing, the, extent, of, the, geometric, deviation, from, a, reference, plane, the, deviation, from, complete, flatness, is, the, direct, result, of, the, workpiece, relaxation, after, hot, or, cold, rolling, due, to, the, internal, stress, pattern, caused, by, the, non, uniform, transversal, compressive, action, of, the, rolls, and, the, uneven, geometrical, properties, of, the, entry, material, the, transverse, distribution, of, differential, strain, elongation, induced, stress, with, respect, to, the, material, s, average, applied, stress, is, commonly, referenced, to, as, shape, due, to, the, strict, relationship, between, shape, and, flatness, these, terms, can, be, used, in, an, interchangeable, manner, in, the, case, of, metal, strips, and, sheets, the, flatness, reflects, the, differential, fiber, elongation, across, the, width, of, the, workpiece, this, property, must, be, subject, to, an, accurate, feedback, based, control, in, order, to, guarantee, the, machinability, of, the, metal, sheets, in, the, final, transformation, processes, some, technological, details, about, the, feedback, control, of, flatness, are, given, in, profile, is, made, up, of, the, measurements, of, crown, and, wedge, crown, is, the, thickness, in, the, center, as, compared, to, the, average, thickness, at, the, edges, of, the, workpiece, wedge, is, a, measure, of, the, thickness, at, one, edge, as, opposed, to, the, other, edge, both, may, be, expressed, as, absolute, measurements, or, as, relative, measurements, for, instance, one, could, have, 2, mil, of, crown, the, center, of, the, workpiece, is, 2, mil, thicker, than, the, edges, or, one, could, have, 2, crown, the, center, of, the, workpiece, is, 2, thicker, than, the, edges, it, is, typically, desirable, to, have, some, crown, in, the, workpiece, as, this, will, cause, the, workpiece, to, tend, to, pull, to, the, center, of, the, mill, and, thus, will, run, with, higher, stability, maintaining, a, uniform, gap, between, the, rolls, is, difficult, because, the, rolls, deflect, under, the, load, required, to, deform, the, workpiece, the, deflection, causes, the, workpiece, to, be, thinner, on, the, edges, and, thicker, in, the, middle, this, can, be, overcome, by, using, a, crowned, roller, parabolic, crown, however, the, crowned, roller, will, only, compensate, for, one, set, of, conditions, specifically, the, material, temperature, and, amount, of, deformation, other, methods, of, compensating, for, roll, deformation, include, continual, varying, crown, cvc, pair, cross, rolling, and, work, roll, bending, cvc, was, developed, by, sms, siemag, ag, and, involves, grinding, a, third, order, polynomial, curve, into, the, work, rolls, and, then, shifting, the, work, rolls, laterally, equally, and, opposite, to, each, other, the, effect, is, that, the, rolls, will, have, a, gap, between, them, that, is, parabolic, in, shape, and, will, vary, with, lateral, shift, thus, allowing, for, control, of, the, crown, of, the, rolls, dynamically, pair, cross, rolling, involves, using, either, flat, or, parabolically, crowned, rolls, but, shifting, the, ends, at, an, angle, so, that, the, gap, between, the, edges, of, the, rolls, will, increase, or, decrease, thus, allowing, for, dynamic, crown, control, work, roll, bending, involves, using, hydraulic, cylinders, at, the, ends, of, the, rolls, to, counteract, roll, deflection, another, way, to, overcome, deflection, issues, is, by, decreasing, the, load, on, the, rolls, which, can, be, done, by, applying, a, longitudinal, force, this, is, essentially, drawing, other, method, of, decreasing, roll, deflection, include, increasing, the, elastic, modulus, of, the, roll, material, and, adding, back, up, supports, to, the, rolls, the, different, classifications, for, flatness, defects, are, one, could, have, a, flatness, defect, even, with, the, workpiece, having, the, same, thickness, across, the, width, also, one, could, have, fairly, high, crown, or, wedge, but, still, produce, material, that, is, flat, in, order, to, produce, flat, material, the, material, must, be, reduced, by, the, same, percentage, across, the, width, this, is, important, because, mass, flow, of, the, material, must, be, preserved, and, the, more, a, material, is, reduced, the, more, it, is, elongated, if, a, material, is, elongated, in, the, same, manner, across, the, width, then, the, flatness, coming, into, the, mill, will, be, preserved, at, the, exit, of, the, mill, the, difference, between, the, thickness, of, initial, and, rolled, metal, piece, is, called, draught, thus, if, t, i, displaystyle, t, i, is, initial, thickness, and, t, f, displaystyle, t, f, is, final, thickness, then, the, draught, d, is, given, by, the, maximum, draught, that, can, be, achieved, via, rollers, of, radius, r, with, coefficient, of, static, friction, f, between, the, roller, and, the, metal, surface, is, given, by, this, is, the, case, when, the, frictional, force, on, the, metal, from, inlet, contact, matches, the, negative, force, from, the, exit, contact, there, are, six, types, of, surface, defects, many, surface, defects, can, be, scarfed, off, the, surface, of, semi, finished, rolled, products, before, further, rolling, methods, of, scarfing, have, included, hand, chipping, with, chisels, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, powered, chipping, and, grinding, with, air, chisels, and, grinders, burning, with, an, oxy, fuel, torch, whose, gas, pressure, blows, away, the, metal, or, slag, melted, by, the, flame, and, laser, scarfing
