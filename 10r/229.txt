plumbing, is, any, system, that, conveys, fluids, for, a, wide, range, of, applications, plumbing, uses, pipes, valves, plumbing, fixtures, tanks, and, other, apparatuses, to, convey, fluids, heating, and, cooling, hvac, waste, removal, and, potable, water, delivery, are, among, the, most, common, uses, for, plumbing, but, it, is, not, limited, to, these, applications, the, word, derives, from, the, latin, for, lead, plumbum, as, the, first, effective, pipes, used, in, the, roman, era, were, lead, pipes, in, the, developed, world, plumbing, infrastructure, is, critical, to, public, health, and, sanitation, boilermakers, and, pipefitters, are, not, plumbers, although, they, work, with, piping, as, part, of, their, trade, and, their, work, can, include, some, plumbing, plumbing, originated, during, ancient, civilizations, as, they, developed, public, baths, and, needed, to, provide, potable, water, and, wastewater, removal, for, larger, numbers, of, people, the, mesopotamians, introduced, the, world, to, clay, sewer, pipes, around, 4000, bce, with, the, earliest, examples, found, in, the, temple, of, bel, at, nippur, and, at, eshnunna, used, to, remove, wastewater, from, sites, and, capture, rainwater, in, wells, the, city, of, uruk, contains, the, oldest, known, examples, of, brick, constructed, latrines, constructed, atop, interconnecting, fired, clay, sewer, pipes, c, 3200, bce, clay, pipes, were, later, used, in, the, hittite, city, of, hattusa, they, had, easily, detachable, and, replaceable, segments, and, allowed, for, cleaning, standardized, earthen, plumbing, pipes, with, broad, flanges, making, use, of, asphalt, for, preventing, leakages, appeared, in, the, urban, settlements, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, by, 2700, bc, copper, piping, appeared, in, egypt, by, 2400, bce, with, the, pyramid, of, sahure, and, adjoining, temple, complex, at, abusir, found, to, be, connected, by, a, copper, waste, pipe, the, word, plumber, dates, from, the, roman, empire, the, latin, for, lead, is, plumbum, roman, roofs, used, lead, in, conduits, and, drain, pipes, and, some, were, also, covered, with, lead, lead, was, also, used, for, piping, and, for, making, baths, plumbing, reached, its, early, apex, in, ancient, rome, which, saw, the, introduction, of, expansive, systems, of, aqueducts, tile, wastewater, removal, and, widespread, use, of, lead, pipes, the, romans, used, lead, pipe, inscriptions, to, prevent, water, theft, with, the, fall, of, rome, both, water, supply, and, sanitation, stagnated, or, regressed, for, well, over, 1, 000, years, improvement, was, very, slow, with, little, effective, progress, made, until, the, growth, of, modern, densely, populated, cities, in, the, 1800s, during, this, period, public, health, authorities, began, pressing, for, better, waste, disposal, systems, to, be, installed, to, prevent, or, control, epidemics, of, disease, earlier, the, waste, disposal, system, had, consisted, of, collecting, waste, and, dumping, it, on, the, ground, or, into, a, river, eventually, the, development, of, separate, underground, water, and, sewage, systems, eliminated, open, sewage, ditches, and, cesspools, in, post, classical, kilwa, the, wealthy, enjoyed, indoor, plumbing, in, their, stone, homes, most, large, cities, today, pipe, solid, wastes, to, sewage, treatment, plants, in, order, to, separate, and, partially, purify, the, water, before, emptying, into, streams, or, other, bodies, of, water, for, potable, water, use, galvanized, iron, piping, was, commonplace, in, the, united, states, from, the, late, 1800s, until, around, 1960, after, that, period, copper, piping, took, over, first, soft, copper, with, flared, fittings, then, with, rigid, copper, tubing, using, soldered, fittings, the, use, of, lead, for, potable, water, declined, sharply, after, world, war, ii, because, of, increased, awareness, of, the, dangers, of, lead, poisoning, at, this, time, copper, piping, was, introduced, as, a, better, and, safer, alternative, to, lead, pipes, the, major, categories, of, plumbing, systems, or, subsystems, are, a, water, pipe, is, a, pipe, or, tube, frequently, made, of, plastic, or, metal, that, carries, pressurized, and, treated, fresh, water, to, a, building, as, part, of, a, municipal, water, system, as, well, as, inside, the, building, lead, was, the, favoured, material, for, water, pipes, for, many, centuries, because, its, malleability, made, it, practical, to, work, into, the, desired, shape, such, use, was, so, common, that, the, word, plumbing, derives, from, plumbum, the, latin, word, for, lead, this, was, a, source, of, lead, related, health, problems, in, the, years, before, the, health, hazards, of, ingesting, lead, were, fully, understood, among, these, were, stillbirths, and, high, rates, of, infant, mortality, lead, water, pipes, were, still, widely, used, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, remain, in, many, households, lead, tin, alloy, solder, was, commonly, used, to, join, copper, pipes, but, modern, practice, uses, tin, antimony, alloy, solder, instead, in, order, to, eliminate, lead, hazards, despite, the, romans, common, use, of, lead, pipes, their, aqueducts, rarely, poisoned, people, unlike, other, parts, of, the, world, where, lead, pipes, cause, poisoning, the, roman, water, had, so, much, calcium, in, it, that, a, layer, of, plaque, prevented, the, water, contacting, the, lead, itself, what, often, causes, confusion, is, the, large, amount, of, evidence, of, widespread, lead, poisoning, particularly, amongst, those, who, would, have, had, easy, access, to, piped, water, an, unfortunate, result, of, lead, being, used, in, cookware, and, as, an, additive, to, processed, food, and, drink, for, example, as, a, preservative, in, wine, roman, lead, pipe, inscriptions, provided, information, on, the, owner, to, prevent, water, theft, wooden, pipes, were, used, in, london, and, elsewhere, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, pipes, were, hollowed, out, logs, which, were, tapered, at, the, end, with, a, small, hole, in, which, the, water, would, pass, through, the, multiple, pipes, were, then, sealed, together, with, hot, animal, fat, wooden, pipes, were, used, in, philadelphia, boston, and, montreal, in, the, 1800s, built, up, wooden, tubes, were, widely, used, in, the, us, during, the, 20th, century, these, pipes, used, in, place, of, corrugated, iron, or, reinforced, concrete, pipes, were, made, of, sections, cut, from, short, lengths, of, wood, locking, of, adjacent, rings, with, hardwood, dowel, pins, produced, a, flexible, structure, about, 100, 000, feet, of, these, wooden, pipes, were, installed, during, ww2, in, drainage, culverts, storm, sewers, and, conduits, under, highways, and, at, army, camps, naval, stations, airfields, and, ordnance, plants, cast, iron, and, ductile, iron, pipe, was, long, a, lower, cost, alternative, to, copper, before, the, advent, of, durable, plastic, materials, but, special, non, conductive, fittings, must, be, used, where, transitions, are, to, be, made, to, other, metallic, pipes, except, for, terminal, fittings, in, order, to, avoid, corrosion, owing, to, electrochemical, reactions, between, dissimilar, metals, see, galvanic, cell, bronze, fittings, and, short, pipe, segments, are, commonly, used, in, combination, with, various, materials, the, difference, between, pipes, and, tubes, is, a, matter, of, sizing, for, instance, pvc, pipe, for, plumbing, applications, and, galvanized, steel, pipe, are, measured, in, iron, pipe, size, ips, copper, tube, cpvc, pex, and, other, tubing, is, measured, nominally, basically, an, average, diameter, these, sizing, schemes, allow, for, universal, adaptation, of, transitional, fittings, for, instance, 1, 2, pex, tubing, is, the, same, size, as, 1, 2, copper, tubing, 1, 2, pvc, on, the, other, hand, is, not, the, same, size, as, 1, 2, tubing, and, therefore, requires, either, a, threaded, male, or, female, adapter, to, connect, them, when, used, in, agricultural, irrigation, the, singular, form, pipe, is, often, used, as, a, plural, pipe, is, available, in, rigid, joints, which, come, in, various, lengths, depending, on, the, material, tubing, in, particular, copper, comes, in, rigid, hard, tempered, joints, or, soft, tempered, annealed, rolls, pex, and, cpvc, tubing, also, comes, in, rigid, joints, or, flexible, rolls, the, temper, of, the, copper, whether, it, is, a, rigid, joint, or, flexible, roll, does, not, affect, the, sizing, the, thicknesses, of, the, water, pipe, and, tube, walls, can, vary, because, piping, and, tubing, are, commodities, having, a, greater, wall, thickness, implies, higher, initial, cost, thicker, walled, pipe, generally, implies, greater, durability, and, higher, pressure, tolerances, pipe, wall, thickness, is, denoted, by, various, schedules, or, for, large, bore, polyethylene, pipe, in, the, uk, by, the, standard, dimension, ratio, sdr, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, pipe, diameter, to, its, wall, thickness, pipe, wall, thickness, increases, with, schedule, and, is, available, in, schedules, 20, 40, 80, and, higher, in, special, cases, the, schedule, is, largely, determined, by, the, operating, pressure, of, the, system, with, higher, pressures, commanding, greater, thickness, copper, tubing, is, available, in, four, wall, thicknesses, type, dwv, thinnest, wall, only, allowed, as, drain, pipe, per, upc, type, m, thin, typically, only, allowed, as, drain, pipe, by, ipc, code, type, l, thicker, standard, duty, for, water, lines, and, water, service, and, type, k, thickest, typically, used, underground, between, the, main, and, the, meter, wall, thickness, does, not, affect, pipe, or, tubing, size, 1, 2, l, copper, has, the, same, outer, diameter, as, 1, 2, k, or, m, copper, the, same, applies, to, pipe, schedules, as, a, result, a, slight, increase, in, pressure, losses, is, realized, due, to, a, decrease, in, flowpath, as, wall, thickness, is, increased, in, other, words, 1, foot, of, 1, 2, l, copper, has, slightly, less, volume, than, 1, foot, of, 1, 2, m, copper, water, systems, of, ancient, times, relied, on, gravity, for, the, supply, of, water, using, pipes, or, channels, usually, made, of, clay, lead, bamboo, wood, or, stone, hollowed, wooden, logs, wrapped, in, steel, banding, were, used, for, plumbing, pipes, particularly, water, mains, logs, were, used, for, water, distribution, in, england, close, to, 500, years, ago, us, cities, began, using, hollowed, logs, in, the, late, 1700s, through, the, 1800s, today, most, plumbing, supply, pipe, is, made, out, of, steel, copper, and, plastic, most, waste, also, known, as, soil, out, of, steel, copper, plastic, and, cast, iron, the, straight, sections, of, plumbing, systems, are, called, pipes, or, tubes, a, pipe, is, typically, formed, via, casting, or, welding, whereas, a, tube, is, made, through, extrusion, pipe, normally, has, thicker, walls, and, may, be, threaded, or, welded, while, tubing, is, thinner, walled, and, requires, special, joining, techniques, such, as, brazing, compression, fitting, crimping, or, for, plastics, solvent, welding, these, joining, techniques, are, discussed, in, more, detail, in, the, piping, and, plumbing, fittings, article, galvanized, steel, potable, water, supply, and, distribution, pipes, are, commonly, found, with, nominal, pipe, sizes, from, 3, 8, inch, 9, 5, mm, to, 2, inches, 51, mm, it, is, rarely, used, today, for, new, construction, residential, plumbing, steel, pipe, has, national, pipe, thread, npt, standard, tapered, male, threads, which, connect, with, female, tapered, threads, on, elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and, other, fittings, galvanized, steel, often, known, simply, as, galv, or, iron, in, the, plumbing, trade, is, relatively, expensive, and, difficult, to, work, with, due, to, weight, and, requirement, of, a, pipe, threader, it, remains, in, common, use, for, repair, of, existing, galv, systems, and, to, satisfy, building, code, non, combustibility, requirements, typically, found, in, hotels, apartment, buildings, and, other, commercial, applications, it, is, also, extremely, durable, and, resistant, to, mechanical, abuse, black, lacquered, steel, pipe, is, the, most, widely, used, pipe, material, for, fire, sprinklers, and, natural, gas, most, typical, single, family, home, systems, will, not, require, supply, piping, larger, than, 3, 4, inch, 19, mm, due, to, expense, as, well, as, steel, piping, s, tendency, to, become, obstructed, from, internal, rusting, and, mineral, deposits, forming, on, the, inside, of, the, pipe, over, time, once, the, internal, galvanizing, zinc, coating, has, degraded, in, potable, water, distribution, service, galvanized, steel, pipe, has, a, service, life, of, about, 30, to, 50, years, although, it, is, not, uncommon, for, it, to, be, less, in, geographic, areas, with, corrosive, water, contaminants, copper, pipe, and, tubing, was, widely, used, for, domestic, water, systems, in, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, demand, for, copper, products, has, fallen, due, to, the, dramatic, increase, in, the, price, of, copper, resulting, in, increased, demand, for, alternative, products, including, pex, and, stainless, steel, plastic, pipe, is, in, wide, use, for, domestic, water, supply, and, drain, waste, vent, dwv, pipe, principal, types, include, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, was, produced, experimentally, in, the, 19th, century, but, did, not, become, practical, to, manufacture, until, 1926, when, waldo, semon, of, bf, goodrich, co, developed, a, method, to, plasticize, pvc, making, it, easier, to, process, pvc, pipe, began, to, be, manufactured, in, the, 1940s, and, was, in, wide, use, for, drain, waste, vent, piping, during, the, reconstruction, of, germany, and, japan, following, wwii, in, the, 1950s, plastics, manufacturers, in, western, europe, and, japan, began, producing, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, abs, pipe, the, method, for, producing, cross, linked, polyethylene, pex, was, also, developed, in, the, 1950s, plastic, supply, pipes, have, become, increasingly, common, with, a, variety, of, materials, and, fittings, employed, present, day, water, supply, systems, use, a, network, of, high, pressure, pumps, and, pipes, in, buildings, are, now, made, of, copper, brass, plastic, particularly, cross, linked, polyethylene, called, pex, which, is, estimated, to, be, used, in, 60, of, single, family, homes, or, other, nontoxic, material, due, to, its, toxicity, most, cities, moved, away, from, lead, water, supply, piping, by, the, 1920s, in, the, united, states, although, lead, pipes, were, approved, by, national, plumbing, codes, into, the, 1980s, and, lead, was, used, in, plumbing, solder, for, drinking, water, until, it, was, banned, in, 1986, drain, and, vent, lines, are, made, of, plastic, steel, cast, iron, or, lead, in, addition, to, lengths, of, pipe, or, tubing, pipe, fittings, such, as, valves, elbows, tees, and, unions, are, used, in, plumbing, systems, pipe, and, fittings, are, held, in, place, with, pipe, hangers, and, strapping, plumbing, fixtures, are, exchangeable, devices, that, use, water, and, can, be, connected, to, a, building, s, plumbing, system, they, are, considered, to, be, fixtures, in, that, they, are, semi, permanent, parts, of, buildings, not, usually, owned, or, maintained, separately, plumbing, fixtures, are, seen, by, and, designed, for, the, end, users, some, examples, of, fixtures, include, water, closets, also, known, as, toilets, urinals, bidets, showers, bathtubs, utility, and, kitchen, sinks, drinking, fountains, ice, makers, humidifiers, air, washers, fountains, and, eye, wash, stations, threaded, pipe, joints, are, sealed, with, thread, seal, tape, or, pipe, dope, many, plumbing, fixtures, are, sealed, to, their, mounting, surfaces, with, plumber, s, putty, plumbing, equipment, includes, devices, often, behind, walls, or, in, utility, spaces, which, are, not, seen, by, the, general, public, it, includes, water, meters, pumps, expansion, tanks, back, flow, preventers, water, filters, uv, sterilization, lights, water, softeners, water, heaters, heat, exchangers, gauges, and, control, systems, there, are, many, tools, a, plumber, needs, to, do, a, good, plumbing, job, while, many, simple, plumbing, tasks, can, be, completed, with, a, few, common, hand, held, tools, other, more, complex, jobs, require, specialised, tools, designed, specifically, to, make, the, job, easier, specialized, plumbing, tools, include, pipe, wrenches, flaring, pliers, pipe, vise, pipe, bending, machine, pipe, cutter, dies, and, joining, tools, such, as, soldering, torches, and, crimp, tools, new, tools, have, been, developed, to, help, plumbers, fix, problems, more, efficiently, for, example, plumbers, use, video, cameras, for, inspections, of, hidden, leaks, or, other, problems, they, also, use, hydro, jets, and, high, pressure, hydraulic, pumps, connected, to, steel, cables, for, trench, less, sewer, line, replacement, flooding, from, excessive, rain, or, clogged, sewers, may, require, specialized, equipment, such, as, a, heavy, duty, pumper, truck, designed, to, vacuum, raw, sewage, bacteria, have, been, shown, to, live, in, premises, plumbing, systems, the, latter, refers, to, the, pipes, and, fixtures, within, a, building, that, transport, water, to, taps, after, it, is, delivered, by, the, utility, community, water, systems, have, been, known, for, centuries, to, spread, waterborne, diseases, like, typhoid, and, cholera, however, opportunistic, premises, plumbing, pathogens, have, been, recognized, only, more, recently, legionella, pneumophila, discovered, in, 1976, mycobacterium, avium, and, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, are, the, most, commonly, tracked, bacteria, which, people, with, depressed, immunity, can, inhale, or, ingest, and, may, become, infected, with, some, of, the, locations, where, these, opportunistic, pathogens, can, grow, include, faucets, shower, heads, water, heaters, and, along, pipe, walls, reasons, that, favor, their, growth, are, high, surface, to, volume, ratio, intermittent, stagnation, low, disinfectant, residual, and, warming, cycles, a, high, surface, to, volume, ratio, i, e, a, relatively, large, surface, area, allows, the, bacteria, to, form, a, biofilm, which, protects, them, from, disinfection, much, of, the, plumbing, work, in, populated, areas, is, regulated, by, government, or, quasi, government, agencies, due, to, the, direct, impact, on, the, public, s, health, safety, and, welfare, plumbing, installation, and, repair, work, on, residences, and, other, buildings, generally, must, be, done, according, to, plumbing, and, building, codes, to, protect, the, inhabitants, of, the, buildings, and, to, ensure, safe, quality, construction, to, future, buyers, if, permits, are, required, for, work, plumbing, contractors, typically, secure, them, from, the, authorities, on, behalf, of, home, or, building, owners, in, australia, the, national, governing, body, for, plumbing, regulation, is, the, australian, building, codes, board, they, are, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, national, construction, code, ncc, volume, 3, of, which, the, plumbing, regulations, 2008, and, the, plumbing, code, of, australia, pertains, to, plumbing, each, government, at, the, state, level, has, their, own, authority, and, regulations, in, place, for, licensing, plumbers, they, are, also, responsible, for, the, interpretation, administration, and, enforcement, of, the, regulations, outlined, in, the, ncc, these, authorities, are, usually, established, for, the, sole, purpose, of, regulating, plumbing, activities, in, their, respective, states, territories, however, several, state, level, regulation, acts, are, quite, outdated, with, some, still, operating, on, local, policies, introduced, more, than, a, decade, ago, this, has, led, to, an, increase, in, plumbing, regulatory, issues, not, covered, under, current, policy, and, as, such, many, policies, are, currently, being, updated, to, cover, these, more, modern, issues, the, updates, include, changed, to, the, minimum, experience, and, training, requirements, for, licensing, additional, work, standards, for, new, and, more, specific, kinds, of, plumbing, as, well, as, adopting, the, plumbing, code, of, australia, into, state, regulations, in, an, effort, to, standardise, plumbing, regulations, across, the, country, in, norway, new, domestic, plumbing, installed, since, 1997, has, had, to, satisfy, the, requirement, that, it, should, be, easily, accessible, for, replacement, after, installation, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, the, pipe, in, pipe, system, as, a, de, facto, requirement, for, domestic, plumbing, in, the, united, kingdom, the, professional, body, is, the, chartered, institute, of, plumbing, and, heating, engineering, educational, charity, status, and, it, is, true, that, the, trade, still, remains, virtually, ungoverned, there, are, no, systems, in, place, to, monitor, or, control, the, activities, of, unqualified, plumbers, or, those, home, owners, who, choose, to, undertake, installation, and, maintenance, works, themselves, despite, the, health, and, safety, issues, which, arise, from, such, works, when, they, are, undertaken, incorrectly, see, health, aspects, of, plumbing, hap, published, jointly, by, the, world, health, organization, who, and, the, world, plumbing, council, wpc, wpc, has, subsequently, appointed, a, representative, to, the, world, health, organization, to, take, forward, various, projects, related, to, health, aspects, of, plumbing, in, the, united, states, plumbing, codes, and, licensing, are, generally, controlled, by, state, and, local, governments, at, the, national, level, the, environmental, protection, agency, has, set, guidelines, about, what, constitutes, lead, free, plumbing, fittings, and, pipes, in, order, to, comply, with, the, safe, drinking, water, act, some, widely, used, standards, in, the, united, states, are, in, canada, plumbing, is, a, regulated, trade, requiring, specific, technical, training, and, certification, standards, and, regulations, for, plumbing, are, overseen, at, the, provincial, and, territorial, level, each, having, its, distinct, governing, body
