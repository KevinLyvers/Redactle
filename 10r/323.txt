the, three, gorges, dam, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, s, nxi, d, b, is, a, hydroelectric, gravity, dam, that, spans, the, yangtze, river, near, sandouping, in, yiling, district, yichang, hubei, province, central, china, downstream, of, the, three, gorges, the, world, s, largest, power, station, in, terms, of, installed, capacity, 22, 500, mw, the, three, gorges, dam, generates, 95, 20, twh, of, electricity, per, year, on, average, depending, on, the, amount, of, precipitation, in, the, river, basin, after, the, extensive, monsoon, rainfalls, of, 2020, the, dam, s, annual, production, reached, nearly, 112, twh, breaking, the, previous, world, record, of, 103, twh, set, by, itaipu, dam, in, 2016, the, dam, s, body, was, completed, in, 2006, the, power, plant, was, completed, and, fully, operational, by, 2012, when, the, last, of, the, main, water, turbines, in, the, underground, plant, began, production, each, of, the, main, water, turbines, has, a, capacity, of, 700, mw, combining, the, capacity, of, the, dam, s, 32, main, turbines, with, the, two, smaller, generators, 50, mw, each, that, provide, power, to, the, plant, itself, the, total, electric, generating, capacity, of, the, three, gorges, dam, is, 22, 500, mw, the, last, major, component, of, the, project, the, ship, lift, was, completed, in, 2015, in, addition, to, generating, electricity, the, dam, was, designed, to, increase, the, yangtze, river, s, shipping, capacity, by, providing, flood, storage, space, the, dam, reduces, the, potential, for, flooding, downstream, which, historically, plagued, the, yangtze, plain, in, 1931, floods, on, the, river, caused, the, deaths, of, up, to, 4, million, people, as, a, result, china, regards, the, project, as, a, monumental, social, and, economical, success, with, the, design, of, state, of, the, art, large, turbines, and, a, move, toward, limiting, greenhouse, gas, emissions, however, the, dam, has, led, to, some, ecological, changes, including, an, increased, risk, of, landslides, which, have, made, it, controversial, domestically, and, abroad, sun, yat, sen, envisioned, a, large, dam, across, the, yangtze, river, in, the, international, development, of, china, 1919, he, wrote, that, a, dam, capable, of, generating, 30, million, horsepower, 22, gw, was, possible, downstream, of, the, three, gorges, in, 1932, the, nationalist, government, led, by, chiang, kai, shek, began, preliminary, work, on, plans, in, the, three, gorges, in, 1939, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, japanese, military, forces, occupied, yichang, and, surveyed, the, area, in, 1944, the, united, states, bureau, of, reclamation, s, head, design, engineer, john, l, savage, surveyed, the, area, and, drew, up, a, dam, proposal, for, a, yangtze, river, project, some, 54, chinese, engineers, went, to, the, us, for, training, the, original, plans, called, for, the, dam, to, employ, a, unique, method, for, moving, ships, the, ships, would, enter, locks, at, the, dam, s, lower, and, upper, ends, and, then, cranes, would, move, them, from, each, lock, to, the, next, groups, of, craft, would, be, lifted, together, for, efficiency, it, is, not, known, whether, this, solution, was, considered, for, its, water, saving, performance, or, because, the, engineers, thought, the, difference, in, height, between, the, river, above, and, below, the, dam, too, great, for, alternative, methods, no, construction, work, was, performed, because, of, the, nationalists, worsening, situation, in, the, chinese, civil, war, 204, after, the, 1949, communist, revolution, mao, zedong, supported, the, project, but, began, the, gezhouba, dam, project, nearby, first, and, economic, problems, including, the, great, leap, forward, and, the, cultural, revolution, slowed, progress, after, the, 1954, yangtze, river, floods, in, 1956, mao, wrote, swimming, a, poem, about, his, fascination, with, a, dam, on, the, yangtze, river, in, 1958, after, the, hundred, flowers, campaign, some, engineers, who, spoke, out, against, the, project, were, imprisoned, during, china, s, emphasis, on, the, four, modernizations, during, its, early, period, of, reform, and, opening, up, the, communist, party, revived, plans, for, the, dam, and, proposed, to, start, construction, in, 1986, 204, it, emphasized, the, need, to, develop, hydroelectric, power, 204, the, chinese, people, s, political, consultative, conference, became, a, center, of, opposition, to, the, proposed, dam, 204, it, convened, panels, of, experts, who, recommended, delaying, the, project, 204, the, national, people, s, congress, approved, the, dam, in, 1992, of, 2, 633, delegates, 1, 767, voted, in, favour, 177, voted, against, 664, abstained, and, 25, members, did, not, vote, giving, the, legislation, an, unusually, low, 67, 75, approval, rate, construction, started, on, december, 14, 1994, the, dam, was, expected, to, be, fully, operational, in, 2009, but, additional, projects, such, as, the, underground, power, plant, with, six, additional, generators, delayed, full, operation, until, 2012, the, ship, lift, was, completed,

not, agreed, upon, and, that, the, dam, sits, on, a, seismic, fault, at, current, levels, 80, of, the, land, in, the, area, is, eroding, depositing, about, 40, million, tons, of, sediment, into, the, yangtze, annually, because, the, flow, is, slower, above, the, dam, much, of, this, sediment, settles, there, instead, of, flowing, downstream, and, there, is, less, sediment, downstream, the, absence, of, silt, downstream, has, three, effects, erosion, in, the, reservoir, induced, by, rising, water, causes, frequent, major, landslides, that, have, led, to, noticeable, disturbance, in, the, reservoir, surface, including, two, incidents, in, may, 2009, when, somewhere, between, 20, 000, and, 50, 000, cubic, metres, 26, 000, and, 65, 000, cu, yd, of, material, plunged, into, the, flooded, wuxia, gorge, of, the, wu, river, in, the, first, four, months, of, 2010, there, were, 97, significant, landslides, some, of, the, most, famous, landslides, in, the, three, gorges, are, the, dam, catalyzed, improved, upstream, wastewater, treatment, around, chongqing, and, its, suburban, areas, according, to, the, ministry, of, environmental, protection, as, of, april, 2007, more, than, 50, new, plants, could, treat, 1, 84, million, tonnes, per, day, 65, of, the, total, need, about, 32, landfills, were, added, which, could, handle, 7, 664, 5, tonnes, of, solid, waste, every, day, over, one, billion, tons, of, wastewater, are, released, annually, into, the, river, which, was, more, likely, to, be, swept, away, before, the, reservoir, was, created, this, has, left, the, water, stagnant, polluted, and, murky, in, 1997, the, three, gorges, area, had, 10, forestation, down, from, 20, in, the, 1950s, research, by, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, suggested, that, the, asia, pacific, region, would, gain, about, 6, 000, km, 2, 2, 300, sq, mi, of, forest, by, 2008, that, is, a, significant, change, from, the, 13, 000, km, 2, 5, 000, sq, mi, net, loss, of, forest, each, year, in, the, 1990s, this, is, largely, due, to, china, s, large, reforestation, effort, this, accelerated, after, the, 1998, yangtze, river, floods, convinced, the, government, that, it, should, restore, tree, cover, especially, in, the, yangtze, s, basin, upstream, of, the, three, gorges, dam, concerns, about, the, dam, s, impact, on, wildlife, predate, the, national, people, s, congress, s, approval, in, 1992, this, region, has, long, been, known, for, its, rich, biodiversity, it, is, home, to, 6, 388, plant, species, which, belong, to, 238, families, and, 1, 508, genera, of, these, species, 57, are, endangered, these, rare, species, are, also, used, as, ingredients, in, traditional, chinese, medicines, the, proportion, of, forested, area, in, the, region, surrounding, the, three, gorges, dam, dropped, from, 20, in, 1950, to, less, than, 10, as, of, 2002, adversely, affecting, all, plant, species, there, the, region, also, provides, habitats, to, hundreds, of, freshwater, and, terrestrial, animal, species, freshwater, fish, are, especially, affected, by, dams, due, to, changes, in, the, water, temperature, and, flow, regime, many, other, fish, are, injured, in, the, hydroelectric, plants, turbine, blades, this, is, particularly, detrimental, to, the, region, s, ecosystem, because, the, yangtze, river, basin, is, home, to, 361, different, fish, species, and, accounts, for, 27, of, china, s, endangered, freshwater, fish, species, other, aquatic, species, have, been, endangered, by, the, dam, particularly, the, baiji, or, chinese, river, dolphin, now, extinct, in, fact, chinese, government, scholars, even, claim, that, the, three, gorges, dam, directly, caused, the, extinction, of, the, baiji, of, the, 3, 000, to, 4, 000, remaining, critically, endangered, siberian, crane, many, spend, the, winter, in, wetlands, that, the, three, gorges, dam, will, destroy, populations, of, the, yangtze, sturgeon, are, guaranteed, to, be, negatively, affected, by, the, dam, in, 2022, the, chinese, paddlefish, was, declared, extinct, with, the, last, confirmed, sighting, in, 2003, in, 2005, nasa, scientists, calculated, that, the, shift, of, water, mass, stored, by, the, dams, would, increase, the, total, length, of, the, earth, s, day, by, 0, 06, microseconds, and, make, the, earth, slightly, more, round, in, the, middle, and, flat, on, the, poles, a, study, published, in, 2022, in, the, journal, open, geosciences, suggests, that, the, change, of, reservoir, water, level, affects, the, gravity, field, in, western, sichuan, which, in, turn, affects, the, seismicity, in, that, area, an, important, function, of, the, dam, is, to, control, flooding, which, is, a, major, problem, for, the, seasonal, river, of, the, yangtze, millions, of, people, live, downstream, of, the, dam, with, many, large, important, cities, like, wuhan, nanjing, and, shanghai, located, adjacent, to, the, river, large, areas, of, farmland, and, china, s, most, important, industrial, area, are, situated, beside, the, river, the, reservoir, s, flood, storage, capacity, is, 22, km, 3, 5, 3, cu, mi, 18, million, acre, ft, this, capacity, will, reduce, the, frequency, of, major, downstream, flooding, from, once, every, 10, years, to, once, every, 100, years, the, dam, is, expected, to, minimize, the, effect, of, even, a, super, flood, the, river, flooded, in, 1954, over, an, area, of, 193, 000, km, 2, 74, 500, sq, mi, killing, 33, 169, people, and, forcing, almost, 18, 9, million, people, to, move, the, flood, waters, covered, wuhan, a, city, of, eight, million, people, for, over, three, months, and, the, jingguang, railway, was, out, of, service, for, more, than, 100, days, the, 1954, flood, carried, 50, cubic, kilometres, 12, cu, mi, of, water, the, dam, could, only, divert, the, water, above, chenglingji, leaving, 30, to, 40, km, 3, 7, 2, to, 9, 6, cu, mi, to, be, diverted, the, dam, cannot, protect, against, some, of, the, large, tributaries, downstream, including, the, xiang, zishui, yuanshui, lishui, hanshui, and, gan, in, 1998, a, flood, in, the, same, area, caused, billions, of, dollars, worth, of, damage, when, 2, 039, km, 2, 787, sq, mi, of, farmland, were, flooded, the, flood, affected, more, than, 2, 3, million, people, killing, 1, 526, in, early, august, 2009, the, largest, flood, in, five, years, passed, through, the, dam, site, during, this, flood, the, dam, limited, the, water, flow, to, less, than, 40, 000, m, 3, s, 1, 4, million, cu, ft, s, per, second, raising, the, upstream, water,

by, as, much, as, 15, 000, m, 3, 530, 000, cu, ft, per, second, the, dam, discharges, its, reservoir, during, the, dry, season, every, year, between, december, and, march, this, increases, the, flow, rate, of, the, river, downstream, providing, fresh, water, for, agricultural, and, industrial, usage, and, improving, shipping, conditions, the, water, level, upstream, drops, from, 175, to, 145, m, 574, to, 476, ft, in, preparation, for, the, rainy, season, the, water, also, powers, the, gezhouba, dam, downstream, since, the, filling, of, the, reservoir, in, 2003, the, three, gorges, dam, has, supplied, an, extra, 11, km, 3, 2, 6, cu, mi, of, fresh, water, to, downstream, cities, and, farms, over, the, course, of, the, dry, season, during, the, south, china, floods, in, july, 2010, inflows, at, the, three, gorges, dam, reached, a, peak, of, 70, 000, m, 3, s, 2, 5, million, cu, ft, s, exceeding, the, peak, inflow, during, the, 1998, yangtze, river, floods, the, dam, s, reservoir, rose, nearly, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, in, 24, hours, and, reduced, the, outflow, to, 40, 000, m, 3, s, 1, 4, million, cu, ft, s, in, discharges, downstream, preventing, any, significant, impact, on, the, middle, and, lower, river, the, installation, of, ship, locks, is, intended, to, increase, river, shipping, from, ten, million, to, 100, million, tonnes, annually, as, a, result, transportation, costs, will, be, cut, between, 30, and, 37, shipping, will, become, safer, since, the, gorges, are, notoriously, dangerous, to, navigate, there, are, two, series, of, ship, locks, installed, near, the, dam, 30, 50, 12, n, 111, 1, 10, e, 30, 83667, n, 111, 01944, e, 30, 83667, 111, 01944, each, of, them, is, made, up, of, five, stages, with, transit, time, at, around, four, hours, maximum, vessel, size, is, 10, 000, tons, the, locks, are, 280, m, long, 35, m, wide, and, 5, m, deep, 918, 114, 16, 4, ft, that, is, 30, m, 98, ft, longer, than, those, on, the, st, lawrence, seaway, but, half, as, deep, before, the, dam, was, constructed, the, maximum, freight, capacity, at, the, three, gorges, site, was, 18, 0, million, tonnes, per, year, from, 2004, to, 2007, a, total, of, 198, million, tonnes, of, freight, passed, through, the, locks, the, freight, capacity, of, the, river, increased, six, times, and, the, cost, of, shipping, was, reduced, by, 25, originally, the, total, capacity, of, the, ship, locks, was, expected, to, reach, 100, million, tonnes, per, year, in, 2022, their, cargo, turnover, reached, 159, 65, million, tons, with, an, annual, increase, of, 6, over, the, past, few, years, these, locks, are, staircase, locks, whereby, inner, lock, gate, pairs, serve, as, both, the, upper, gate, of, the, chamber, below, and, the, lower, gate, of, the, chamber, above, the, gates, are, the, vulnerable, hinged, type, which, if, damaged, could, temporarily, render, the, entire, flight, unusable, as, there, are, separate, sets, of, locks, for, upstream, and, downstream, traffic, this, system, is, more, water, efficient, than, bi, directional, staircase, locks, in, addition, to, the, canal, locks, there, is, a, ship, lift, a, kind, of, elevator, for, vessels, the, ship, lift, can, lift, ships, of, up, to, 3, 000, tons, the, vertical, distance, traveled, is, 113, m, 371, ft, and, the, size, of, the, ship, lift, s, basin, is, 120, m, 18, m, 3, 5, m, 394, ft, 59, ft, 11, ft, the, ship, lift, takes, 30, to, 40, minutes, to, transit, as, opposed, to, the, three, to, four, hours, for, stepping, through, the, locks, one, complicating, factor, is, that, the, water, level, can, vary, dramatically, the, ship, lift, must, work, even, if, water, levels, vary, by, 12, m, 39, ft, on, the, lower, side, and, 30, m, 98, ft, on, the, upper, side, the, ship, lift, s, design, uses, a, helical, gear, system, to, climb, or, descend, a, toothed, rack, the, ship, lift, was, not, yet, complete, when, the, rest, of, the, project, was, officially, opened, on, may, 20, 2006, in, november, 2007, it, was, reported, in, the, local, media, that, construction, of, the, ship, lift, started, in, october, 2007, in, february, 2012, xinhua, reported, that, the, four, towers, that, are, to, support, the, ship, lift, had, almost, been, completed, the, report, said, the, towers, had, reached, 189, m, 620, ft, of, the, anticipated, 195, m, 640, ft, the, towers, would, be, completed, by, june, 2012, and, the, entire, shiplift, in, 2015, as, of, may, 2014, the, ship, lift, was, expected, to, be, completed, by, july, 2015, it, was, tested, in, december, 2015, and, announced, complete, in, january, 2016, lahmeyer, the, german, firm, that, designed, the, ship, lift, said, it, will, take, a, vessel, less, than, an, hour, to, transit, the, lift, an, article, in, steel, construction, says, the, actual, time, of, the, lift, will, be, 21, minutes, it, says, that, the, expected, dimensions, of, the, 3, 000, t, 3, million, kg, passenger, vessels, the, ship, lift, s, basin, was, designed, to, carry, will, be, 84, 5, by, 17, 2, by, 2, 65, metres, 277, 2, ft, 56, 4, ft, 8, 7, ft, the, moving, mass, including, counterweights, is, 34, 000, tonnes, the, trials, of, elevator, finished, in, july, 2016, the, first, cargo, ship, was, lifted, on, july, 15, the, lift, time, comprised, 8, minutes, shanghai, daily, reported, that, the, first, operational, use, of, the, lift, was, on, september, 18, 2016, when, limited, operational, testing, of, the, lift, began, plans, also, exist, for, the, construction, of, short, portage, railways, bypassing, the, dam, area, altogether, two, short, rail, lines, one, on, each, side, of, the, river, are, to, be, constructed, the, 88, kilometre, long, 55, mi, northern, portage, railway, will, run, from, the, taipingxi, port, facility, on, the, northern, side, of, the, yangtze, just, upstream, from, the, dam, via, yichang, east, railway, station, to, the, baiyang, tianjiahe, port, facility, in, baiyang, town, below, yichang, the, 95, kilometre, long, 59, mi, southern, portage, railway, will, run, from, maoping, upstream, of, the, dam, via, yichang, south, railway, station, to, zhicheng, on, the, jiaozuo, liuzhou, railway, in, late, 2012, preliminary, work, started, along, both, future, railway, routes, during, planning, it, was, estimated, that, 13, cities, 140, towns, and, 1, 350, villages, would, be, partially, or, completely, flooded, by, the, reservoir, amounting, to, roughly, 1, 5, of, hubei, s, 60, 3, million, people, and, chongqing, municipality, s, 31, 44, million, people, these, people, were, moved, to, new, homes, by, the, chinese, government, which, considered, the, displacement, justified, by, the, flood, protection, provided, for, the, communities, downstream, of, the, dam, between, 2002, and, 2005, canadian, photographer, edward, burtynsky, documented, the, impact, of, the, project, on, the, surrounding, areas, including, the, town, of, wanzhou, other, photographers, who, recorded, the, change, include, chengdu, based, muge, paris, based, zeng, nian, originally, from, jiangsu, and, israeli, nadav, kander, living, conditions, deteriorated, for, many, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, could, not, find, work, the, older, generation, was, particularly, affected, but, younger, generations, benefited, from, the, educational, and, career, opportunities, afforded, by, moving, to, large, cities, with, new, modern, companies, and, schools, some, 2007, reports, claimed, that, chongqing, municipality, would, encourage, four, million, more, people, to, move, away, from, the, dam, to, chongqing, s, main, urban, area, by, 2020, the, municipal, government, asserted, that, the, relocation, was, driven, by, urbanization, rather, than, a, direct, result, of, the, dam, project, and, that, the, people, involved, included, other, areas, of, the, municipality, by, june, 2008, china, had, moved, 1, 24, million, residents, as, far, as, gaoyang, in, hebei, province, and, the, moves, concluded, the, following, month, the, area, which, would, fill, with, water, behind, the, dam, included, locations, with, significant, cultural, history, 206, the, state, council, authorized, a, 505, million, archaeology, salvage, effort, 206, over, the, course, of, several, years, archaeologists, excavated, 723, sites, and, conducted, surface, archaeology, recovery, missions, at, an, additional, 346, sites, 206, archaeologists, recovered, 200, 000, artifacts, of, which, 13, 000, were, considered, as, particularly, historically, or, culturally, notable, 206, as, part, of, this, effort, the, old, chongqing, city, museum, was, replaced, by, the, chongqing, china, sanxia, museum, to, house, many, of, the, recovered, artifacts, 206, recovered, structures, that, were, too, large, for, museums, were, moved, upland, to, reconstruction, districts, fu, jian, qu, which, are, outdoor, museum, parks, recovered, structures, placed, in, such, parks, include, temples, pavilions, houses, and, bridges, among, others, 206, some, sites, could, not, be, moved, because, of, their, location, size, or, design, such, as, the, hanging, coffins, site, high, in, the, shen, nong, gorge, part, of, the, cliffs, the, united, states, department, of, defense, reported, that, in, taiwan, proponents, of, strikes, against, the, mainland, apparently, hope, that, merely, presenting, credible, threats, to, china, s, urban, population, or, high, value, targets, such, as, the, three, gorges, dam, will, deter, chinese, military, coercion, destroying, the, three, gorges, dam, has, been, a, tactic, discussed, and, debated, in, taiwan, since, the, early, 1990s, when, the, dam, was, still, in, the, planning, phase, the, notion, that, the, military, in, taiwan, would, seek, to, destroy, the, dam, provoked, an, angry, response, from, the, mainland, chinese, media, people, s, liberation, army, general, liu, yuan, was, quoted, in, the, china, youth, daily, saying, that, the, people, s, republic, of, china, would, be, seriously, on, guard, against, threats, from, taiwan, independence, terrorists, former, taiwanese, ministry, of, defense, advisor, sung, chao, wen, called, the, notion, of, using, cruise, missiles, to, destroy, the, three, gorges, dam, ridiculous, saying, missiles, would, deliver, minimal, damage, to, the, reinforced, concrete, and, any, attack, attempts, would, have, to, go, through, multiple, layers, of, ground, and, air, defenses, the, three, gorges, dam, is, a, steel, concrete, gravity, dam, the, water, is, held, back, by, the, innate, mass, of, the, individual, dam, sections, as, a, result, damage, to, an, individual, section, should, not, affect, other, parts, of, the, dam, zhang, boting, deputy, secretary, general, of, china, society, for, hydropower, engineering, suggested, that, concrete, gravity, dams, such, as, the, three, gorges, dam, are, resistant, to, nuclear, strikes, debate, among, chinese, scholars, and, analysts, about, the, basic, principles, of, china, s, no, first, use, of, nuclear, weapons, policy, includes, whether, to, include, narrow, exceptions, such, as, acts, that, produce, catastrophic, consequences, equivalent, to, that, of, a, nuclear, attack, including, attacks, intended, to, destroy, the, three, gorges, dam, immediately, after, the, reservoir, was, first, filled, around, 80, hairline, cracks, were, observed, in, the, dam, s, structure, still, an, experts, group, gave, the, project, overall, a, good, quality, rating, the, 163, 000, concrete, units, all, passed, quality, testing, with, normal, deformation, within, design, limits, in, order, to, maximize, the, utility, of, the, three, gorges, dam, and, cut, down, on, sedimentation, from, the, jinsha, river, the, upper, course, of, the, yangtze, river, authorities, are, building, a, series, of, dams, on, the, jinsha, including, the, now, completed, wudongde, baihetan, xiluodu, and, xiangjiaba, dams, the, total, capacity, of, those, four, dams, is, 38, 500, mw, almost, double, the, capacity, of, the, three, gorges, baihetan, became, fully, operational, in, 2022, wudongde, was, opened, in, june, 2021, another, eight, dams, are, in, the, midstream, of, the, jinsha, and, eight, more, upstream, of, it
