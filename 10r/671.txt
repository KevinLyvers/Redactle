a, bus, contracted, from, omnibus, with, variants, multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc, is, a, motor, vehicle, that, carries, significantly, more, passengers, than, an, average, car, or, van, but, less, than, the, average, rail, transport, it, is, most, commonly, used, in, public, transport, but, is, also, in, use, for, charter, purposes, or, through, private, ownership, although, the, average, bus, carries, between, 30, and, 100, passengers, some, buses, have, a, capacity, of, up, to, 300, passengers, the, most, common, type, is, the, single, deck, rigid, bus, with, double, decker, and, articulated, buses, carrying, larger, loads, and, midibuses, and, minibuses, carrying, smaller, loads, coaches, are, used, for, longer, distance, services, many, types, of, buses, such, as, city, transit, buses, and, inter, city, coaches, charge, a, fare, other, types, such, as, elementary, or, secondary, school, buses, or, shuttle, buses, within, a, post, secondary, education, campus, are, free, in, many, jurisdictions, bus, drivers, require, a, special, large, vehicle, licence, above, and, beyond, a, regular, driving, licence, buses, may, be, used, for, scheduled, bus, transport, scheduled, coach, transport, school, transport, private, hire, or, tourism, promotional, buses, may, be, used, for, political, campaigns, and, others, are, privately, operated, for, a, wide, range, of, purposes, including, rock, and, pop, band, tour, vehicles, horse, drawn, buses, were, used, from, the, 1820s, followed, by, steam, buses, in, the, 1830s, and, electric, trolleybuses, in, 1882, the, first, internal, combustion, engine, buses, or, motor, buses, were, used, in, 1895, recently, interest, has, been, growing, in, hybrid, electric, buses, fuel, cell, buses, and, electric, buses, as, well, as, buses, powered, by, compressed, natural, gas, or, biodiesel, as, of, the, 2010s, bus, manufacturing, is, increasingly, globalised, with, the, same, designs, appearing, around, the, world, the, word, bus, is, a, shortened, form, of, the, latin, adjectival, form, omnibus, for, all, the, dative, plural, of, omnis, omne, all, the, theoretical, full, name, is, in, french, voiture, omnibus, vehicle, for, all, the, name, originates, from, a, mass, transport, service, started, in, 1823, by, a, french, corn, mill, owner, named, stanislas, baudry, in, richebourg, a, suburb, of, nantes, a, by, product, of, his, mill, was, hot, water, and, thus, next, to, it, he, established, a, spa, business, in, order, to, encourage, customers, he, started, a, horse, drawn, transport, service, from, the, city, centre, of, nantes, to, his, establishment, the, first, vehicles, stopped, in, front, of, the, shop, of, a, hatter, named, omn, s, which, displayed, a, large, sign, inscribed, omnes, omnibus, a, pun, on, his, latin, sounding, surname, omnes, being, the, male, and, female, nominative, vocative, and, accusative, form, of, the, latin, adjective, omnis, e, all, combined, with, omnibus, the, dative, plural, form, meaning, for, all, thus, giving, his, shop, the, name, omn, s, for, all, or, everything, for, everyone, his, transport, scheme, was, a, huge, success, although, not, as, he, had, intended, as, most, of, his, passengers, did, not, visit, his, spa, he, turned, the, transport, service, into, his, principal, lucrative, business, venture, and, closed, the, mill, and, spa, nantes, citizens, soon, gave, the, nickname, omnibus, to, the, vehicle, having, invented, the, successful, concept, baudry, moved, to, paris, and, launched, the, first, omnibus, service, there, in, april, 1828, a, similar, service, was, introduced, in, manchester, in, 1824, and, in, london, in, 1829, regular, intercity, bus, services, by, steam, powered, buses, were, pioneered, in, england, in, the, 1830s, by, walter, hancock, and, by, associates, of, sir, goldsworthy, gurney, among, others, running, reliable, services, over, road, conditions, which, were, too, hazardous, for, horse, drawn, transportation, the, first, mechanically, propelled, omnibus, appeared, on, the, streets, of, london, on, 22, april, 1833, steam, carriages, were, much, less, likely, to, overturn, they, travelled, faster, than, horse, drawn, carriages, they, were, much, cheaper, to, run, and, caused, much, less, damage, to, the, road, surface, due, to, their, wide, tyres, however, the, heavy, road, tolls, imposed, by, the, turnpike, trusts, discouraged, steam, road, vehicles, and, left, the, way, clear, for, the, horse, bus, companies, and, from, 1861, onwards, harsh, legislation, virtually, eliminated, mechanically, propelled, vehicles, from, the, roads, of, great, britain, for, 30, years, the, locomotive, act, 1861, imposing, restrictive, speed, limits, on, road, locomotives, of, 5, mph, 8, 0, km, h, in, towns, and, cities, and, 10, mph, 16, km, h, in, the, country, in, parallel, to, the, development, of, the, bus, was, the, invention, of, the, electric, trolleybus, typically, fed, through, trolley, poles, by, overhead, wires, the, siemens, brothers, william, in, england, and, ernst, werner, in, germany, collaborated, on, the, development, of, the, trolleybus, concept, sir, william, first, proposed, the, idea, in, an, article, to, the, journal, of, the, society, of, arts, in, 1881, as, an, arrangement, by, which, an, ordinary, omnibus, would, have, a, suspender, thrown, at, intervals, from, one, side, of, the, street, to, the, other, and, two, wires, hanging, from, these, suspenders, allowing, contact, rollers, to, run, on, these, two, wires, the, current, could, be, conveyed, to, the, tram, car, and, back, again, to, the, dynamo, machine, at, the, station, without, the, necessity, of, running, upon, rails, at, all, the, first, such, vehicle, the, electromote, was, made, by, his, brother, ernst, werner, von, siemens, and, presented, to, the, public, in, 1882, in, halensee, germany, although, this, experimental, vehicle, fulfilled, all, the, technical, criteria, of, a, typical, trolleybus, it, was, dismantled, in, the, same, year, after, the, demonstration, max, schiemann, opened, a, passenger, carrying, trolleybus, in, 1901, near, dresden, in, germany, although, this, system, operated, only, until, 1904, schiemann, had, developed, what, is, now, the, standard, trolleybus, current, collection, system, in, the, early, days, a, few, other, methods, of, current, collection, were, used, leeds, and, bradford, became, the, first, cities, to, put, trolleybuses, into, service, in, great, britain, on, 20, june, 1911, in, siegerland, germany, two, passenger, bus, lines, ran, briefly, but, unprofitably, in, 1895, using, a, six, passenger, motor, carriage, developed, from, the, 1893, benz, viktoria, another, commercial, bus, line, using, the, same, model, benz, omnibuses, ran, for, a, short, time, in, 1898, in, the, rural, area, around, llandudno, wales, germany, s, daimler, motors, corporation, also, produced, one, of, the, earliest, motor, bus, models, in, 1898, selling, a, double, decker, bus, to, the, motor, traction, company, which, was, first, used, on, the, streets, of, london, on, 23, april, 1898, the, vehicle, had, a, maximum, speed, of, 18, km, h, 11, 2, mph, and, accommodated, up, to, 20, passengers, in, an, enclosed, area, below, and, on, an, open, air, platform, above, with, the, success, and, popularity, of, this, bus, dmg, expanded, production, selling, more, buses, to, companies, in, london, and, in, 1899, to, stockholm, and, speyer, daimler, motors, corporation, also, entered, into, a, partnership, with, the, british, company, milnes, and, developed, a, new, double, decker, in, 1902, that, became, the, market, standard, the, first, mass, produced, bus, model, was, the, b, type, double, decker, bus, designed, by, frank, searle, and, operated, by, the, london, general, omnibus, company, it, entered, service, in, 1910, and, almost, 3, 000, had, been, built, by, the, end, of, the, decade, hundreds, of, them, saw, military, service, on, the, western, front, during, the, first, world, war, the, yellow, coach, manufacturing, company, which, rapidly, became, a, major, manufacturer, of, buses, in, the, us, was, founded, in, chicago, in, 1923, by, john, d, hertz, general, motors, purchased, a, majority, stake, in, 1925, and, changed, its, name, to, the, yellow, truck, and, coach, manufacturing, company, gm, purchased, the, balance, of, the, shares, in, 1943, to, form, the, gm, truck, and, coach, division, models, expanded, in, the, 20th, century, leading, to, the, widespread, introduction, of, the, contemporary, recognizable, form, of, full, sized, buses, from, the, 1950s, the, aec, routemaster, developed, in, the, 1950s, was, a, pioneering, design, and, remains, an, icon, of, london, to, this, day, the, innovative, design, used, lightweight, aluminium, and, techniques, developed, in, aircraft, production, during, world, war, ii, as, well, as, a, novel, weight, saving, integral, design, it, also, introduced, for, the, first, time, on, a, bus, independent, front, suspension, power, steering, a, fully, automatic, gearbox, and, power, hydraulic, braking, formats, include, single, decker, bus, double, decker, bus, both, usually, with, a, rigid, chassis, and, articulated, bus, or, bendy, bus, the, prevalence, of, which, varies, from, country, to, country, high, capacity, bi, articulated, buses, are, also, manufactured, and, passenger, carrying, trailers, either, towed, behind, a, rigid, bus, a, bus, trailer, or, hauled, as, a, trailer, by, a, truck, a, trailer, bus, smaller, midibuses, have, a, lower, capacity, and, open, top, buses, are, typically, used, for, leisure, purposes, in, many, new, fleets, particularly, in, local, transit, systems, a, shift, to, low, floor, buses, is, occurring, primarily, for, easier, accessibility, coaches, are, designed, for, longer, distance, travel, and, are, typically, fitted, with, individual, high, backed, reclining, seats, seat, belts, toilets, and, audio, visual, entertainment, systems, and, can, operate, at, higher, speeds, with, more, capacity, for, luggage, coaches, may, be, single, or, double, deckers, articulated, and, often, include, a, separate, luggage, compartment, under, the, passenger, floor, guided, buses, are, fitted, with, technology, to, allow, them, to, run, in, designated, guideways, allowing, the, controlled, alignment, at, bus, stops, and, less, space, taken, up, by, guided, lanes, than, conventional, roads, or, bus, lanes, bus, manufacturing, may, be, by, a, single, company, an, integral, manufacturer, or, by, one, manufacturer, s, building, a, bus, body, over, a, chassis, produced, by, another, manufacturer, transit, buses, used, to, be, mainly, high, floor, vehicles, however, they, are, now, increasingly, of, low, floor, design, and, optionally, also, kneel, air, suspension, and, have, ramps, to, provide, access, for, wheelchair, users, and, people, with, baby, carriages, sometimes, as, electrically, or, hydraulically, extended, under, floor, constructs, for, level, access, prior, to, more, general, use, of, such, technology, these, wheelchair, users, could, only, use, specialist, para, transit, mobility, buses, accessible, vehicles, also, have, wider, entrances, and, interior, gangways, and, space, for, wheelchairs, interior, fittings, and, destination, displays, may, also, be, designed, to, be, usable, by, the, visually, impaired, coaches, generally, use, wheelchair, lifts, instead, of, low, floor, designs, in, some, countries, vehicles, are, required, to, have, these, features, by, disability, discrimination, laws, buses, were, initially, configured, with, an, engine, in, the, front, and, an, entrance, at, the, rear, with, the, transition, to, one, man, operation, many, manufacturers, moved, to, mid, or, rear, engined, designs, with, a, single, door, at, the, front, or, multiple, doors, the, move, to, the, low, floor, design, has, all, but, eliminated, the, mid, engined, design, although, some, coaches, still, have, mid, mounted, engines, front, engined, buses, still, persist, for, niche, markets, such, as, american, school, buses, some, minibuses, and, buses, in, less, developed, countries, which, may, be, derived, from, truck, chassis, rather, than, purpose, built, bus, designs, most, buses, have, two, axles, while, articulated, buses, have, three, guided, buses, are, fitted, with, technology, to, allow, them, to, run, in, designated, guideways, allowing, the, controlled, alignment, at, bus, stops, and, less, space, taken, up, by, guided, lanes, than, conventional, roads, or, bus, lanes, guidance, can, be, mechanical, optical, or, electromagnetic, extensions, of, the, guided, technology, include, the, guided, light, transit, and, translohr, systems, although, these, are, more, often, termed, rubber, tyred, trams, as, they, have, limited, or, no, mobility, away, from, their, guideways, transit, buses, are, normally, painted, to, identify, the, operator, or, a, route, function, or, to, demarcate, low, cost, or, premium, service, buses, liveries, may, be, painted, onto, the, vehicle, applied, using, adhesive, vinyl, technologies, or, using, decals, vehicles, often, also, carry, bus, advertising, or, part, or, all, of, their, visible, surfaces, as, mobile, billboard, campaign, buses, may, be, decorated, with, key, campaign, messages, these, can, be, to, promote, an, event, or, initiative, the, most, common, power, source, since, the, 1920s, has, been, the, diesel, engine, early, buses, known, as, trolleybuses, were, powered, by, electricity, supplied, from, overhead, lines, nowadays, electric, buses, often, carry, their, own, battery, which, is, sometimes, recharged, on, stops, stations, to, keep, the, size, of, the, battery, small, lightweight, currently, interest, exists, in, hybrid, electric, buses, fuel, cell, buses, electric, buses, and, ones, powered, by, compressed, natural, gas, or, biodiesel, gyrobuses, which, are, powered, by, the, momentum, stored, by, a, flywheel, were, tried, in, the, 1940s, united, kingdom, and, european, union, united, states, canada, and, mexico, early, bus, manufacturing, grew, out, of, carriage, coach, building, and, later, out, of, automobile, or, truck, manufacturers, early, buses, were, merely, a, bus, body, fitted, to, a, truck, chassis, this, body, chassis, approach, has, continued, with, modern, specialist, manufacturers, although, there, also, exist, integral, designs, such, as, the, leyland, national, where, the, two, are, practically, inseparable, specialist, builders, also, exist, and, concentrate, on, building, buses, for, special, uses, or, modifying, standard, buses, into, specialised, products, integral, designs, have, the, advantages, that, they, have, been, well, tested, for, strength, and, stability, and, also, are, off, the, shelf, however, two, incentives, cause, use, of, the, chassis, body, model, first, it, allows, the, buyer, and, manufacturer, both, to, shop, for, the, best, deal, for, their, needs, rather, than, having, to, settle, on, one, fixed, design, the, buyer, can, choose, the, body, and, the, chassis, separately, second, over, the, lifetime, of, a, vehicle, in, constant, service, and, heavy, traffic, it, will, likely, get, minor, damage, now, and, again, and, being, able, easily, to, replace, a, body, panel, or, window, etc, can, vastly, increase, its, service, life, and, save, the, cost, and, inconvenience, of, removing, it, from, service, as, with, the, rest, of, the, automotive, industry, into, the, 20th, century, bus, manufacturing, increasingly, became, globalized, with, manufacturers, producing, buses, far, from, their, intended, market, to, exploit, labour, and, material, cost, advantages, a, typical, city, bus, costs, almost, us, 450, 000, transit, buses, used, on, public, transport, bus, services, have, utilitarian, fittings, designed, for, efficient, movement, of, large, numbers, of, people, and, often, have, multiple, doors, coaches, are, used, for, longer, distance, routes, high, capacity, bus, rapid, transit, services, may, use, the, bi, articulated, bus, or, tram, style, buses, such, as, the, wright, streetcar, and, the, irisbus, civis, buses, and, coach, services, often, operate, to, a, predetermined, published, public, transport, timetable, defining, the, route, and, the, timing, but, smaller, vehicles, may, be, used, on, more, flexible, demand, responsive, transport, services, buses, play, a, major, part, in, the, tourism, industry, tour, buses, around, the, world, allow, tourists, to, view, local, attractions, or, scenery, these, are, often, open, top, buses, but, can, also, be, regular, buses, or, coaches, in, local, sightseeing, city, sightseeing, is, the, largest, operator, of, local, tour, buses, operating, on, a, franchised, basis, all, over, the, world, specialist, tour, buses, are, also, often, owned, and, operated, by, safari, parks, and, other, theme, parks, or, resorts, longer, distance, tours, are, also, carried, out, by, bus, either, on, a, turn, up, and, go, basis, or, through, a, tour, operator, and, usually, allow, disembarkation, from, the, bus, to, allow, touring, of, sites, of, interest, on, foot, these, may, be, day, trips, or, longer, excursions, incorporating, hotel, stays, tour, buses, often, carry, a, tour, guide, although, the, driver, or, a, recorded, audio, commentary, may, also, perform, this, function, the, tour, operator, may, be, a, subsidiary, of, a, company, that, operates, buses, and, coaches, for, other, uses, or, an, independent, company, that, charters, buses, or, coaches, commuter, transport, operators, may, also, use, their, coaches, to, conduct, tours, within, the, target, city, between, the, morning, and, evening, commuter, transport, journey, buses, and, coaches, are, also, a, common, component, of, the, wider, package, holiday, industry, providing, private, airport, transfers, in, addition, to, general, airport, buses, and, organised, tours, and, day, trips, for, holidaymakers, on, the, package, tour, buses, can, also, be, hired, as, chartered, buses, by, groups, for, sightseeing, at, popular, holiday, destinations, these, private, tour, buses, may, offer, specific, stops, such, as, all, the, historical, sights, or, allow, the, customers, to, choose, their, own, itineraries, tour, buses, come, with, professional, and, informed, staff, and, insurance, and, maintain, state, governed, safety, standards, some, provide, other, facilities, like, entertainment, units, luxurious, reclining, seats, large, scenic, windows, and, even, lavatories, public, long, distance, coach, networks, are, also, often, used, as, a, low, cost, method, of, travel, by, students, or, young, people, travelling, the, world, some, companies, such, as, topdeck, travel, were, set, up, specifically, to, use, buses, to, drive, the, hippie, trail, or, travel, to, places, such, as, north, africa, in, many, tourist, or, travel, destinations, a, bus, is, part, of, the, tourist, attraction, such, as, the, north, american, tourist, trolleys, london, s, aec, routemaster, heritage, routes, or, the, customised, buses, of, malta, asia, and, the, americas, another, example, of, tourist, stops, is, the, homes, of, celebrities, such, as, tours, based, near, hollywood, there, are, several, such, services, between, 6000, and, 7000, hollywood, boulevard, in, los, angeles, in, some, countries, particularly, the, us, and, canada, buses, used, to, transport, schoolchildren, have, evolved, into, a, specific, design, with, specified, mandatory, features, american, states, have, also, adopted, laws, regarding, motorist, conduct, around, school, buses, including, large, fines, and, possibly, prison, for, passing, a, stopped, school, bus, in, the, process, of, loading, or, offloading, children, passengers, these, school, buses, may, have, school, bus, yellow, livery, and, crossing, guards, other, countries, may, mandate, the, use, of, seat, belts, as, a, minimum, many, countries, require, a, bus, carrying, students, to, display, a, sign, and, may, also, adopt, yellow, liveries, student, transport, often, uses, older, buses, cascaded, from, service, use, retrofitted, with, more, seats, or, seatbelts, student, transport, may, be, operated, by, local, authorities, or, private, contractors, schools, may, also, own, and, operate, their, own, buses, for, other, transport, needs, such, as, class, field, trips, or, transport, to, associated, sports, music, or, other, school, events, due, to, the, costs, involved, in, owning, operating, and, driving, buses, and, coaches, much, bus, and, coach, use, comes, from, the, private, hire, of, vehicles, from, charter, bus, companies, either, for, a, day, or, two, or, on, a, longer, contract, basis, where, the, charter, company, provides, the, vehicles, and, qualified, drivers, charter, bus, operators, may, be, completely, independent, businesses, or, charter, hire, may, be, a, subsidiary, business, of, a, public, transport, operator, that, might, maintain, a, separate, fleet, or, use, surplus, buses, coaches, and, dual, purpose, coach, seated, buses, many, private, taxicab, companies, also, operate, larger, minibus, vehicles, to, cater, for, group, fares, companies, private, groups, and, social, clubs, may, hire, buses, or, coaches, as, a, cost, effective, method, of, transporting, a, group, to, an, event, or, site, such, as, a, group, meeting, racing, event, or, organised, recreational, activity, such, as, a, summer, camp, schools, often, hire, charter, bus, services, on,

organisations, including, the, police, not, for, profit, social, or, charitable, groups, with, a, regular, need, for, group, transport, may, find, it, practical, or, cost, effective, to, own, and, operate, a, bus, for, their, own, needs, these, are, often, minibuses, for, practical, tax, and, driver, licensing, reasons, although, they, can, also, be, full, size, buses, cadet, or, scout, groups,
