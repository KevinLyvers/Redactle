a, forming, press, commonly, shortened, to, press, is, a, machine, tool, that, changes, the, shape, of, a, work, piece, by, the, application, of, pressure, the, operator, of, a, forming, press, is, known, as, a, press, tool, setter, often, shortened, to, tool, setter, presses, can, be, classified, according, to, typically, consisting, of, a, simple, rectangular, frame, often, fabricated, from, c, channel, or, tubing, containing, a, bottle, jack, or, hydraulic, cylinder, to, apply, pressure, via, a, ram, to, a, work, piece, often, used, for, general, purpose, forming, work, in, the, auto, mechanic, shop, machine, shop, garage, or, basement, shops, etc, typical, shop, presses, are, capable, of, applying, between, 1, and, 30, tons, pressure, depending, on, size, and, construction, lighter, duty, versions, are, often, called, arbor, presses, a, shop, press, is, commonly, used, to, press, interference, fit, parts, together, such, as, gears, onto, shafts, or, bearings, into, housings, a, servomechanism, press, also, known, as, a, servo, press, or, an, electro, press, is, a, press, driven, by, an, ac, servo, motor, the, torque, produced, is, converted, to, a, linear, force, via, a, ball, screw, pressure, and, position, are, controlled, through, a, load, cell, and, an, encoder, the, main, advantage, of, a, servo, press, is, its, low, energy, consumption, its, only, 10, 20, of, other, press, machines, when, stamping, it, is, really, about, maximizing, energy, as, opposed, to, how, the, machine, can, deliver, tonnage, up, until, recently, the, way, to, increase, tonnage, between, the, die, and, work, piece, on, a, mechanical, press, was, through, bigger, machines, with, bigger, motors, the, press, style, used, is, in, direct, correlation, to, the, end, product, press, types, are, straight, side, bg, back, geared, geared, gap, obi, open, back, inclinable, and, obs, open, back, stationary, hydraulic, and, mechanical, presses, are, classified, by, the, frame, the, moving, elements, are, mounted, on, the, most, common, are, the, gap, frame, also, known, as, c, frame, and, the, straight, side, press, a, straight, side, press, has, vertical, columns, on, either, side, of, the, machine, and, eliminates, angular, deflection, a, c, frame, allows, easy, access, to, the, die, area, on, three, sides, and, require, less, floor, space, a, type, of, gap, frame, the, obi, pivots, the, frame, for, easier, scrap, or, part, discharge, the, obs, timed, air, blasts, devices, or, conveyor, for, scrap, or, part, discharge, historically, metal, was, shaped, by, hand, using, a, hammer, later, larger, hammers, were, constructed, to, press, more, metal, at, once, or, to, press, thicker, materials, often, a, smith, would, employ, a, helper, or, apprentice, to, swing, the, hammer, while, the, smith, concentrated, on, positioning, the, work, piece, drop, hammers, and, trip, hammers, utilize, a, mechanism, to, lift, the, hammer, which, then, falls, by, gravity, onto, the, work, in, the, mid, 19th, century, manual, and, rotary, cam, hammers, began, to, be, replaced, in, industry, by, the, steam, hammer, which, was, first, described, in, 1784, by, james, watt, a, british, inventor, and, mechanical, engineer, who, also, contributed, to, the, earliest, steam, engines, and, condensers, but, not, built, until, 1840, by, british, inventor, james, nasmyth, by, the, late, 19th, century, steam, hammers, had, increased, greatly, in, size, in, 1891, the, bethlehem, iron, company, made, an, enhancement, allowing, a, steam, hammer, to, deliver, a, 125, ton, blow, most, modern, machine, presses, typically, use, a, combination, of, electric, motors, and, hydraulics, to, achieve, the, necessary, pressure, along, with, the, evolution, of, presses, came, the, evolution, of, the, dies, used, within, them, machine, presses, can, be, hazardous, so, safety, measures, must, always, be, taken, bi, manual, controls, controls, the, use, of, which, requires, both, hands, to, be, on, the, buttons, to, operate, are, a, very, good, way, to, prevent, accidents, as, are, light, curtains, that, keep, the, machine, from, working, if, the, operator, is, in, range, of, the, die
