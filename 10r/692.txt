the, london, underground, also, known, simply, as, the, underground, or, by, its, nickname, the, tube, is, a, rapid, transit, system, serving, greater, london, and, some, parts, of, the, adjacent, home, counties, of, buckinghamshire, essex, and, hertfordshire, in, england, the, underground, has, its, origins, in, the, metropolitan, railway, opening, on, 10, january, 1863, as, the, world, s, first, underground, passenger, railway, the, metropolitan, is, now, part, of, the, circle, district, hammersmith, city, and, metropolitan, lines, the, first, line, to, operate, underground, electric, traction, trains, the, city, south, london, railway, in, 1890, is, now, part, of, the, northern, line, the, network, has, expanded, to, 11, lines, with, 250, miles, 400, km, of, track, however, the, underground, does, not, cover, most, southern, parts, of, greater, london, there, are, only, 33, underground, stations, south, of, the, river, thames, the, system, s, 272, stations, collectively, accommodate, up, to, 5, million, passenger, journeys, a, day, in, 2023, 24, it, was, used, for, 1, 181, billion, passenger, journeys, the, system, s, first, tunnels, were, built, just, below, the, ground, using, the, cut, and, cover, method, later, smaller, roughly, circular, tunnels, which, gave, rise, to, its, nickname, the, tube, were, dug, through, at, a, deeper, level, despite, its, name, only, 45, of, the, system, is, under, the, ground, much, of, the, network, in, the, outer, environs, of, london, is, on, the, surface, the, early, tube, lines, originally, owned, by, several, private, companies, were, brought, together, under, the, underground, brand, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, eventually, merged, along, with, the, sub, surface, lines, and, bus, services, in, 1933, to, form, london, transport, under, the, control, of, the, london, passenger, transport, board, lptb, the, current, operator, london, underground, limited, lul, is, a, wholly, owned, subsidiary, of, transport, for, london, tfl, the, statutory, corporation, responsible, for, the, transport, network, in, london, as, of, 2015, 92, of, operational, expenditure, is, covered, by, passenger, fares, the, travelcard, ticket, was, introduced, in, 1983, and, oyster, card, a, contactless, ticketing, system, in, 2003, contactless, bank, card, payments, were, introduced, in, 2014, the, first, such, use, on, a, public, transport, system, the, lptb, commissioned, many, new, station, buildings, posters, and, public, artworks, in, a, modernist, style, the, schematic, tube, map, designed, by, harry, beck, in, 1931, was, voted, a, national, design, icon, in, 2006, and, now, includes, other, transport, systems, besides, the, underground, such, as, the, docklands, light, railway, london, overground, thameslink, the, elizabeth, line, and, tramlink, other, famous, london, underground, branding, includes, the, roundel, and, the, johnston, typeface, created, by, edward, johnston, in, 1916, the, idea, of, an, underground, railway, linking, the, city, of, london, with, the, urban, centre, was, proposed, in, the, 1830s, and, the, metropolitan, railway, was, granted, permission, to, build, such, a, line, in, 1854, to, prepare, construction, a, short, test, tunnel, was, built, in, 1855, in, kibblesworth, a, small, town, with, geological, properties, similar, to, london, this, test, tunnel, was, used, for, two, years, in, the, development, of, the, first, underground, train, and, was, later, in, 1861, filled, up, the, world, s, first, underground, railway, it, opened, in, january, 1863, between, paddington, and, farringdon, using, gas, lit, wooden, carriages, hauled, by, steam, locomotives, it, was, hailed, as, a, success, carrying, 38, 000, passengers, on, the, opening, day, and, borrowing, trains, from, other, railways, to, supplement, the, service, the, metropolitan, district, railway, commonly, known, as, the, district, railway, opened, in, december, 1868, from, south, kensington, to, westminster, as, part, of, a, plan, for, an, underground, inner, circle, connecting, london, s, main, line, stations, the, metropolitan, and, district, railways, completed, the, circle, line, in, 1884, built, using, the, cut, and, cover, method, both, railways, expanded, the, district, building, five, branches, to, the, west, reaching, ealing, hounslow, uxbridge, richmond, and, wimbledon, and, the, metropolitan, eventually, extended, as, far, as, verney, junction, in, buckinghamshire, more, than, 50, miles, 80, km, from, baker, street, and, the, centre, of, london, for, the, first, deep, level, tube, line, the, city, and, south, london, railway, two, 10, feet, 2, inches, 3, 10, m, diameter, circular, tunnels, were, dug, between, king, william, street, close, to, today, s, monument, station, and, stockwell, under, the, roads, to, avoid, the, need, for, agreement, with, owners, of, property, on, the, surface, this, opened, in, 1890, with, electric, locomotives, that, hauled, carriages, with, small, opaque, windows, nicknamed, padded, cells, the, waterloo, and, city, railway, opened, in, 1898, followed, by, the, central, london, railway, in, 1900, known, as, the, twopenny, tube, these, two, ran, electric, trains, in, circular, tunnels, having, diameters, between, 11, feet, 8, inches, 3, 56, m, and, 12, feet, 2, 5, inches, 3, 72, m, whereas, the, great, northern, and, city, railway, which, opened, in, 1904, was, built, to, take, main, line, trains, from, finsbury, park, to, a, moorgate, terminus, in, the, city, and, had, 16, foot, 4, 9, m, diameter, tunnels, while, steam, locomotives, were, in, use, on, the, underground, there, were, contrasting, health, reports, there, were, many, instances, of, passengers, collapsing, whilst, travelling, due, to, heat, and, pollution, leading, for, calls, to, clean, the, air, through, the, installation, of, garden, plants, the, metropolitan, even, encouraged, beards, for, staff, to, act, as, an, air, filter, there, were, other, reports, claiming, beneficial, outcomes, of, using, the, underground, including, the, designation, of, great, portland, street, as, a, sanatorium, for, asthma, and, bronchial, complaints, tonsillitis, could, be, cured, with, acid, gas, and, the, twopenny, tube, cured, anorexia, with, the, advent, of, electric, tube, services, the, waterloo, and, city, railway, and, the, great, northern, and, city, railway, the, volks, electric, railway, in, brighton, and, competition, from, electric, trams, the, pioneering, underground, companies, needed, modernising, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, district, and, metropolitan, railways, needed, to, electrify, and, a, joint, committee, recommended, an, ac, system, the, two, companies, co, operating, because, of, the, shared, ownership, of, the, inner, circle, the, district, needing, to, raise, the, finance, necessary, found, an, investor, in, the, american, charles, yerkes, who, favoured, a, dc, system, similar, to, that, in, use, on, the, city, south, london, and, central, london, railways, the, metropolitan, railway, protested, about, the, change, of, plan, but, after, arbitration, by, the, board, of, trade, the, dc, system, was, adopted, yerkes, soon, had, control, of, the, district, railway, and, established, the, underground, electric, railways, company, of, london, uerl, in, 1902, to, finance, and, operate, three, tube, lines, the, baker, street, and, waterloo, railway, bakerloo, the, charing, cross, euston, and, hampstead, railway, hampstead, and, the, great, northern, piccadilly, and, brompton, railway, piccadilly, which, all, opened, between, 1906, and, 1907, when, the, bakerloo, was, so, named, in, july, 1906, the, railway, magazine, called, it, an, undignified, gutter, title, by, 1907, the, district, and, metropolitan, railways, had, electrified, the, underground, sections, of, their, lines, in, january, 1913, the, uerl, acquired, the, central, london, railway, and, the, city, south, london, railway, as, well, as, many, of, london, s, bus, and, tram, operators, only, the, metropolitan, railway, along, with, its, subsidiaries, the, great, northern, city, railway, and, the, east, london, railway, and, the, waterloo, city, railway, by, then, owned, by, the, main, line, london, and, south, western, railway, remained, outside, the, underground, group, s, control, a, joint, marketing, agreement, between, most, of, the, companies, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, included, maps, joint, publicity, through, ticketing, and, u, ndergroun, d, signs, incorporating, the, first, bullseye, symbol, outside, stations, in, central, london, at, the, time, the, term, underground, was, selected, from, three, other, proposed, names, tube, and, electric, were, both, officially, rejected, ironically, the, term, tube, was, later, adopted, alongside, the, underground, the, bakerloo, line, was, extended, north, to, queen, s, park, to, join, a, new, electric, line, from, euston, to, watford, but, the, first, world, war, delayed, construction, and, trains, reached, watford, junction, in, 1917, during, air, raids, in, 1915, people, used, the, tube, stations, as, shelters, an, extension, of, the, central, line, west, to, ealing, was, also, delayed, by, the, war, and, was, completed, in, 1920, after, the, war, government, backed, financial, guarantees, were, used, to, expand, the, network, and, the, tunnels, of, the, city, and, south, london, and, hampstead, railways, were, linked, at, euston, and, kennington, the, combined, service, was, not, named, the, northern, line, until, later, the, metropolitan, promoted, housing, estates, near, the, railway, with, the, metro, land, brand, and, nine, housing, estates, were, built, near, stations, on, the, line, electrification, was, extended, north, from, harrow, to, rickmansworth, and, branches, opened, from, rickmansworth, to, watford, in, 1925, and, from, wembley, park, to, stanmore, in, 1932, the, piccadilly, line, was, extended, north, to, cockfosters, and, took, over, district, line, branches, to, harrow, later, uxbridge, and, hounslow, in, 1933, most, of, london, s, underground, railways, tramway, and, bus, services, were, merged, to, form, the, london, passenger, transport, board, which, used, the, london, transport, brand, the, waterloo, city, railway, which, was, by, then, in, the, ownership, of, the, main, line, southern, railway, remained, with, its, existing, owners, in, the, same, year, that, the, london, passenger, transport, board, was, formed, harry, beck, s, diagrammatic, tube, map, first, appeared, in, the, following, years, the, outlying, lines, of, the, former, metropolitan, railway, closed, the, brill, tramway, in, 1935, and, the, line, from, quainton, road, to, verney, junction, in, 1936, the, 1935, 40, new, works, programme, included, the, extension, of, the, central, and, northern, lines, and, the, bakerloo, line, to, take, over, the, metropolitan, s, stanmore, branch, the, second, world, war, suspended, these, plans, after, the, bakerloo, line, had, reached, stanmore, and, the, northern, line, high, barnet, and, mill, hill, east, in, 1941, following, bombing, in, 1940, passenger, services, over, the, west, london, line, were, suspended, leaving, olympia, exhibition, centre, without, a, railway, service, until, a, district, line, shuttle, from, earl, s, court, began, after, the, war, after, work, restarted, on, the, central, line, extensions, in, east, and, west, london, these, were, completed, in, 1949, during, the, war, many, tube, stations, were, used, as, air, raid, shelters, they, were, not, always, a, guarantee, of, safety, however, on, 11, january, 1941, during, the, london, blitz, a, bomb, penetrated, the, booking, hall, of, bank, station, the, blast, from, which, killed, 111, people, many, of, whom, were, sleeping, in, passageways, and, on, platforms, on, 3, march, 1943, a, test, of, the, air, raid, warning, sirens, together, with, the, firing, of, a, new, type, of, anti, aircraft, rocket, resulted, in, a, crush, of, people, attempting, to, take, shelter, in, bethnal, green, underground, station, a, total, of, 173, people, including, 62, children, died, making, this, both, the, worst, civilian, disaster, in, britain, during, the, second, world, war, and, the, largest, loss, of, life, in, a, single, incident, on, the, london, underground, network, on, 1, january, 1948, under, the, provisions, of, the, transport, act, 1947, the, london, passenger, transport, board, was, nationalised, and, renamed, the, london, transport, executive, becoming, a, subsidiary, transport, organisation, of, the, british, transport, commission, which, was, formed, on, the, same, day, under, the, same, act, the, country, s, main, line, railways, were, also, nationalised, and, their, reconstruction, was, given, priority, over, the, maintenance, of, the, underground, and, most, of, the, unfinished, plans, of, the, pre, war, new, works, programme, were, shelved, or, postponed, the, district, line, needed, new, trains, and, an, unpainted, aluminium, train, entered, service, in, 1953, this, becoming, the, standard, for, new, trains, in, the, early, 1960s, the, metropolitan, line, was, electrified, as, far, as, amersham, british, railways, providing, services, for, the, former, metropolitan, line, stations, between, amersham, and, aylesbury, in, 1962, the, british, transport, commission, was, abolished, and, the, london, transport, executive, was, renamed, the, london, transport, board, reporting, directly, to, the, minister, of, transport, also, during, the, 1960s, the, victoria, line, was, dug, under, central, london, and, unlike, the, earlier, tunnels, did, not, follow, the, roads, above, the, line, opened, in, 1968, 71, with, the, trains, being, driven, automatically, and, magnetically, encoded, tickets, collected, by, automatic, gates, gave, access, to, the, platforms, on, 1, january, 1970, responsibility, for, public, transport, within, greater, london, passed, from, central, government, to, local, government, in, the, form, of, the, greater, london, council, glc, and, the, london, transport, board, was, abolished, the, london, transport, brand, continued, to, be, used, by, the, glc, on, 28, february, 1975, a, southbound, train, on, the, northern, city, line, failed, to, stop, at, its, moorgate, terminus, and, crashed, into, the, wall, at, the, end, of, the, tunnel, in, the, moorgate, tube, crash, there, were, 43, deaths, and, 74, injuries, the, greatest, loss, of, life, during, peacetime, on, the, london, underground, in, 1976, the, northern, city, line, was, taken, over, by, british, rail, and, linked, up, with, the, main, line, railway, at, finsbury, park, a, transfer, that, had, already, been, planned, prior, to, the, accident, in, 1979, another, new, tube, the, jubilee, line, named, in, honour, of, the, silver, jubilee, of, elizabeth, ii, took, over, the, stanmore, branch, from, the, bakerloo, line, linking, it, to, a, newly, constructed, line, between, baker, street, and, charing, cross, stations, under, the, control, of, the, glc, london, transport, introduced, a, system, of, fare, zones, for, buses, and, underground, trains, that, cut, the, average, fare, in, 1981, fares, increased, following, a, legal, challenge, but, the, fare, zones, were, retained, and, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, travelcard, and, the, capitalcard, were, introduced, in, 1984, control, of, london, buses, and, the, london, underground, passed, back, to, central, government, with, the, creation, of, london, regional, transport, lrt, which, reported, directly, to, the, secretary, of, state, for, transport, still, retaining, the, london, transport, brand, one, person, operation, had, been, planned, in, 1968, but, conflict, with, the, trade, unions, delayed, introduction, until, the, 1980s, on, 18, november, 1987, fire, broke, out, in, an, escalator, at, king, s, cross, st, pancras, tube, station, the, resulting, fire, cost, the, lives, of, 31, people, and, injured, a, further, 100, london, underground, was, strongly, criticised, in, the, aftermath, for, its, attitude, to, fires, underground, and, publication, of, the, report, into, the, fire, led, to, the, resignation, of, senior, management, of, both, london, underground, and, london, regional, transport, following, the, fire, substantial, improvements, to, safety, on, the, tube, were, implemented, including, the, banning, of, smoking, removal, of, wooden, escalators, installation, of, cctv, and, fire, detectors, as, well, as, comprehensive, radio, coverage, for, the, emergency, services, in, april, 1994, the, waterloo, city, railway, by, then, owned, by, british, rail, and, known, as, the, waterloo, city, line, was, transferred, to, the, london, underground, in, 1999, the, jubilee, line, extension, project, extended, the, jubilee, line, from, green, park, station, through, the, growing, docklands, to, stratford, station, this, resulted, in, the, closure, of, the, short, section, of, tunnel, between, green, park, and, charing, cross, stations, the, 11, new, stations, were, designed, to, be, future, proof, with, wide, passageways, large, quantities, of, escalators, and, lifts, and, emergency, exits, the, stations, were, the, first, on, the, underground, to, have, platform, edge, doors, and, were, built, to, have, step, free, access, throughout, the, stations, have, subsequently, been, praised, as, exemplary, pieces, of, 20th, century, architecture, in, 2000, transport, for, london, tfl, was, created, as, an, integrated, body, responsible, for, london, s, transport, system, part, of, the, greater, london, authority, the, tfl, board, is, appointed, by, the, mayor, of, london, who, also, sets, the, structure, and, level, of, public, transport, fares, in, london, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, corporation, is, left, to, the, commissioner, of, transport, for, london, tfl, eventually, replaced, london, regional, transport, and, discontinued, the, use, of, the, london, transport, brand, in, favour, of, its, own, brand, the, transfer, of, responsibility, was, staged, with, transfer, of, control, of, london, underground, delayed, until, july, 2003, when, london, underground, limited, became, an, indirect, subsidiary, of, tfl, in, the, early, 2000s, london, underground, was, reorganised, in, a, public, private, partnership, ppp, as, part, of, a, project, to, upgrade, and, modernise, the, system, private, infrastructure, companies, infracos, would, upgrade, and, maintain, the, railway, and, london, underground, would, run, the, train, service, one, infraco, metronet, went, into, administration, in, 2007, and, tfl, took, over, the, other, tube, lines, in, 2010, despite, this, substantial, investment, to, upgrade, and, modernise, the, tube, has, taken, place, with, new, trains, such, as, london, underground, s7, and, s8, stock, new, signalling, upgraded, stations, such, as, king, s, cross, st, pancras, and, improved, accessibility, such, as, at, green, park, small, changes, to, the, tube, network, occurred, in, the, 2000s, with, extensions, to, heathrow, terminal, 5, new, station, at, wood, lane, and, the, circle, line, changed, from, serving, a, closed, loop, around, the, centre, of, london, to, a, spiral, also, serving, hammersmith, in, 2009, in, july, 2005, four, coordinated, terrorist, attacks, took, place, three, of, them, occurring, on, the, tube, network, it, was, the, uk, s, deadliest, terrorist, incident, since, 1988, electronic, ticketing, in, the, form, of, the, contactless, oyster, card, was, first, introduced, in, 2003, with, payment, using, contactless, banks, cards, introduced, in, september, 2014, in, 2019, over, 12, million, oyster, cards, and, 35, million, contactless, cards, were, used, generating, around, 5, billion, in, ticketing, revenue, during, the, london, 2012, olympic, and, paralympic, games, the, underground, saw, record, ridership, levels, with, over, 4, 3, million, people, using, the, tube, on, some, days, this, record, was, subsequently, beaten, in, later, years, with, 4, 82, million, riders, in, december, 2015, in, 2013, the, underground, celebrated, its, 150th, anniversary, with, celebratory, events, such, as, steam, trains, and, installation, of, a, unique, labyrinth, artwork, at, each, station, under, tfl, london, s, public, transport, network, became, more, unified, with, existing, suburban, rail, lines, across, london, upgraded, and, rebranded, as, london, overground, from, 2007, with, the, former, east, london, line, becoming, part, of, the, overground, network, in, 2010, many, overground, stations, interchange, with, underground, ones, and, overground, lines, were, added, onto, the, tube, map, in, the, 2010s, the, 18, 8bn, crossrail, project, built, a, new, east, west, railway, tunnel, under, central, london, the, project, involved, rebuilding, and, expanding, several, central, underground, stations, including, tottenham, court, road, and, whitechapel, by, increasing, rail, capacity, the, line, aims, to, reduce, overcrowding, on, the, tube, and, cut, cross, london, journey, times, the, railway, opened, as, the, elizabeth, line, in, may, 2022, although, not, part, of, the, underground, the, line, connects, with, several, underground, stations, in, 2020, passenger, numbers, fell, significantly, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, 40, stations, were, temporarily, closed, the, northern, line, extension, opened, in, september, 2021, extending, the, northern, line, from, kennington, to, battersea, power, station, via, nine, elms, the, extension, was, privately, funded, with, contributions, from, developments, across, the, battersea, power, station, vauxhall, and, nine, elms, areas, as, of, 2021, the, underground, serves, 272, stations, sixteen, stations, eight, on, each, of, the, metropolitan, and, central, lines, are, outside, the, london, region, with, five, of, those, beyond, the, m25, london, orbital, motorway,

lewisham, and, sutton, are, not, served, by, the, underground, network, while, hackney, has, old, street, on, the, northern, line, bank, branch, and, manor, house, on, the, piccadilly, line, just, inside, its, boundaries, lewisham, was, served, by, the, east, london, line, with, stations, at, new, cross, and, new, cross, gate, until, 2010, when, the, line, and, the, stations, were, transferred, to, the, london, overground, network, london, underground, s, eleven, lines, total, 402, kilometres, 250, mi, in, length, making, it, the, eleventh, longest, metro, system, in, the, world, these, are, made, up, of, the, sub, surface, network, and, the, deep, tube, lines, the, circle, district, hammersmith, city, and, metropolitan, lines, form, the, sub, surface, network, with, cut, and, cover, railway, tunnels, just, below, the, surface, and, of, a, similar, size, to, those, on, british, main, lines, they, converged, on, a, bi, directional, loop, in, central, london, sharing, tracks, and, stations, with, each, other, at, various, places, along, their, respective, routes, the, bakerloo, central, jubilee, northern, piccadilly, victoria, and, waterloo, city, lines, are, deep, level, tubes, with, smaller, trains, that, run, in, circular, tunnels, tubes, with, a, diameter, of, about, 11, feet, 8, inches, 3, 56, m, with, one, tube, for, each, direction, the, seven, deep, level, lines, have, the, exclusive, use, of, tracks, and, stations, along, their, routes, with, the, exceptions, of, the, piccadilly, line, which, shares, track, with, the, district, line, between, acton, town, and, hanger, lane, junction, and, with, the, metropolitan, line, between, rayners, lane, and, uxbridge, and, the, bakerloo, line, which, shares, track, with, london, overground, s, watford, dc, line, for, its, above, ground, section, north, of, queen, s, park, fifty, five, per, cent, of, the, system, runs, on, the, surface, there, are, 20, miles, 32, km, of, sub, surface, tunnels, and, 93, miles, 150, km, of, tube, tunnels, many, of, the, central, london, underground, stations, on, deep, level, tube, routes, are, higher, than, the, running, lines, to, assist, deceleration, when, arriving, and, acceleration, when, departing, trains, generally, run, on, the, left, hand, track, in, some, places, the, tunnels, are, above, each, other, for, example, the, central, line, east, of, st, paul, s, station, or, trains, run, on, the, right, for, example, on, the, victoria, line, between, warren, street, and, king, s, cross, st, pancras, to, allow, cross, platform, interchange, with,

following, depots, in, the, years, since, the, first, parts, of, the, london, underground, opened, many, stations, and, routes, have, been, closed, some, stations, were, closed, because, of, low, passenger, numbers, rendering, them, uneconomical, some, became, redundant, after, lines, were, re, routed, or, replacements, were, constructed, and, others, are, no, longer, served, by, the, underground, but, remain, open, to, national, rail, main, line, services, in, some, cases, such, as, aldwych, and, ongar, the, buildings, remain, and, are, used, for, other, purposes, in, others,

collections, a, southern, extension, of, the, bakerloo, line, from, elephant, castle, has, been, proposed, multiple, times, since, the, line, opened, in, the, 2010s, consultation, events, and, preliminary, design, work, took, place, on, an, extension, a, route, from, elephant, castle, to, lewisham, via, the, old, kent, road, and, new, cross, gate, was, chosen, by, transport, for, london, in, 2019, the, line, could, be, extended, further, on, the, hayes, national, rail, line, in, future, estimated, to, cost, between, 4, 7bn, to, 7, 9bn, in, 2017, prices, the, extension, would, take, around, 7, years, to, construct, due, to, financial, impacts, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, work, to, implement, the, extension, is, currently, on, hold, several, other, extensions, have, been, proposed, in, recent, years, including, a, further, extension, of, the, northern, line, to, clapham, junction, the, long, proposed, croxley, rail, link, an, extension, of, the, metropolitan, line, was, cancelled, in, 2018, due, to, higher, than, expected, costs, and, lack, of, funding, in, 2019, the, canary, wharf, group, suggested, the, construction, of, a, new, rail, line, between, euston, and, canary, wharf, to, improve, connections, to, the, future, high, speed, 2, railway, in, 2021, harlow, district, council, proposed, extending, the, central, line, from, its, eastern, terminus, in, epping, to, harlow, they, argued, this, would, reduce, travel, times, to, epping, and, london, and, help, with, efforts, to, add, 19, 000, new, homes, to, the, town, and, expand, the, population, to, 130, 000, however, no, funding, has, been, allocated, for, this, proposed, extension, the, thirty, six, 1972, stock, trains, on, the, bakerloo, line, have, already, exceeded, their, original, design, life, of, 40, years, london, underground, is, therefore, extending, their, operational, life, by, making, major, repairs, to, many, of, the, trains, to, maintain, reliability, the, bakerloo, line, will, receive, new, trains, as, part, of, the, new, tube, for, london, project, this, will, replace, the, existing, fleet, with, new, air, cooled, articulated, trains, and, a, new, signalling, system, to, allow, automatic, train, operation, the, line, is, predicted, to, run, a, maximum, of, 27, trains, per, hour, a, 25, increase, on, the, current, 21, trains, per, hour, during, peak, periods, the, central, line, was, the, first, line, to, be, modernised, in, the, 1990s, with, 85, new, 1992, stock, trains, and, a, new, automatic, signalling, system, installed, to, allow, automatic, train, operation, the, line, runs, 34, trains, per, hour, for, half, an, hour, in, the, morning, peak, but, is, unable, to, operate, more, frequently, because, of, a, lack, of, additional, trains, the, 85, existing, 1992, stock, trains, are, the, most, unreliable, on, the, london, underground, as, they, are, equipped, with, the, first, generation, of, solid, state, direct, current, thyristor, control, traction, equipment, the, trains, often, break, down, have, to, be, withdrawn, from, service, at, short, notice, and, at, times, are, not, available, when, required, leading, to, gaps, in, service, at, peak, times, although, relatively, modern, and, well, within, their, design, life, the, trains, need, work, in, the, medium, term, to, ensure, the, continued, reliability, of, the, traction, control, equipment, and, maintain, fleet, serviceability, until, renewal, which, is, expected, between, 2028, and, 2032, major, work, is, to, be, undertaken, on, the, fleet, to, ensure, their, continued, reliability, with, brakes, traction, control, systems, doors, automatic, control, systems, being, repaired, or, replaced, among, other, components, the, central, line, will, be, part, of, the, new, tube, for, london, project, this, will, replace, the, existing, fleet, with, new, air, cooled, walkthrough, trains, and, a, new, automatic, signalling, system, the, line, is, predicted, to, run, 36, trains, per, hour, a, 25, increase, compared, to, the, present, service, of, 34, trains, for, the, busiest, 30, minutes, in, the, morning, and, evening, peaks, and, 27, 30, trains, per, hour, during, the, rest, of, the, peak, the, signalling, system, on, the, jubilee, line, has, been, replaced, to, increase, capacity, on, the, line, by, 20, the, line, now, runs, 30, trains, per, hour, at, peak, times, compared, to, the, previous, 24, trains, per, hour, as, with, the, victoria, line, the, service, frequency, is, planned, to, increase, to, 36, trains, per, hour, to, enable, this, ventilation, power, supply, and, control, and, signalling, systems, will, be, adapted, and, modified, to, allow, the, increase, in, frequency, london, underground, also, plans, to, add, up, to, an, additional, 18, trains, to, the, current, fleet, of, 63, trains, of, 1996, stock, the, signalling, system, on, the, northern, line, has, been, replaced, to, increase, capacity, on, the, line, by, 20, as, the, line, now, runs, 24, trains, per, hour, at, peak, times, compared, to, 20, previously, capacity, can, be, increased, further, if, the, operation, of, the, charing, cross, and, bank, branches, is, separated, to, enable, this, up, to, 50, additional, trains, will, be, built, in, addition, to, the, current, 106, 1995, stock, five, trains, will, be, required, for, the, northern, line, extension, and, 45, to, increase, frequencies, on, the, rest, of, the, line, this, combined, with, segregation, of, trains, at, camden, town, junction, will, allow, 30, 36, trains, per, hour, compared, to, 24, trains, per, hour, currently, the, eighty, six, 1973, stock, trains, that, operate, on, the, piccadilly, line, are, some, of, the, most, reliable, trains, on, the, london, underground, the, trains, have, exceeded, their, design, life, of, around, 40, years, and, are, in, need, of, replacement, the, piccadilly, line, will, be, part, of, the, new, tube, for, london, project, this, will, replace, the, existing, fleet, with, new, air, cooled, walk, through, trains, and, a, new, signalling, system, to, allow, automatic, train, operation, the, line, is, predicted, to, run, 30, 36, trains, per, hour, up, to, a, 50, increase, compared, to, the, 24, 25, train, per, hour, service, provided, today, the, line, will, be, the, first, to, be, upgraded, as, part, of, the, new, tube, for, london, project, as, passenger, numbers, have, increased, over, recent, years, and, are, expected, to, increase, further, this, line, is, important, in, this, project, because, it, currently, provides, a, less, frequent, service, than, other, lines, the, signalling, system, on, the, victoria, line, has, been, replaced, to, increase, capacity, on, the, line, by, around, 25, the, line, now, runs, up, to, 36, trains, per, hour, compared, to, 27, 28, previously, the, trains, have, been, replaced, with, 47, new, higher, capacity, 2009, stock, trains, the, peak, frequency, was, increased, to, 36, trains, per, hour, in, 2016, after, track, works, were, completed, to, the, layout, of, the, points, at, walthamstow, central, crossover, which, transfers, northbound, trains, to, the, southbound, line, for, their, return, journey, this, resulted, in, a, 40, increase, in, capacity, between, seven, sisters, and, walthamstow, central, the, line, was, upgraded, with, five, new, 1992, stock, trains, in, the, early, 1990s, at, the, same, time, as, the, central, line, was, upgraded, the, line, operates, under, traditional, signalling, and, does, not, use, automatic, train, operation, the, line, will, be, part, of, the, new, tube, for, london, project, this, will, replace, the, existing, fleet, with, new, air, cooled, walk, through, trains, and, a, new, signalling, system, to, allow, automatic, train, operation, the, line, is, predicted, to, run, 30, trains, per, hour, an, increase, of, up, to, 50, on, the, current, 21, trains, per, hour, the, line, may, also, be, one, of, the, first, to, be, upgraded, alongside, the, piccadilly, line, with, new, trains, systems, and, platform, edge, doors, to, test, the, systems, before, the, central, and, bakerloo, lines, are, upgraded, new, s, stock, trains, have, been, introduced, on, the, sub, surface, district, metropolitan, hammersmith, city, and, circle, lines, these, were, all, delivered, by, 2017, 191, trains, have, been, introduced, 58, for, the, metropolitan, line, and, 133, for, the, circle, district, and, hammersmith, city, lines, the, track, electrical, supply, and, signalling, systems, are, also, being, upgraded, in, a, programme, to, increase, peak, hour, capacity, the, replacement, of, the, signalling, system, and, the, introduction, of, automatic, train, operation, and, control, is, scheduled, for, 2019, 22, a, control, room, for, the, sub, surface, network, has, been, built, in, hammersmith, and, an, automatic, train, control, atc, system, is, to, replace, ageing, signalling, equipment, dating, from, between, the, mid, 1920s, and, late, 1980s, including, the, signal, cabin, at, edgware, road, the, control, room, at, earl, s, court, and, the, signalling, centre, at, baker, street, bombardier, won, the, contract, in, june, 2011, but, was, released, by, agreement, in, december, 2013, and, london, underground, has, now, issued, another, signalling, contract, with, thales, in, mid, 2014, transport, for, london, issued, a, tender, for, up, to, 18, trains, for, the, jubilee, line, and, up, to, 50, trains, for, the, northern, line, these, would, be, used, to, increase, frequencies, and, cover, the, battersea, extension, on, the, northern, line, in, early, 2014, the, bakerloo, central, piccadilly, and, waterloo, city, line, rolling, stock, replacement, project, was, renamed, new, tube, for, london, ntfl, and, moved, from, the, feasibility, stage, to, the, design, and, specification, stage, the, study, had, showed, that, with, new, generation, trains, and, re, signalling, the, project, is, estimated, to, cost, 16, 42, billion, 9, 86, billion, at, 2013, prices, a, notice, was, published, on, 28, february, 2014, in, the, official, journal, of, the, european, union, asking, for, expressions, of, interest, in, building, the, trains, on, 9, october, 2014, tfl, published, a, shortlist, of, those, alstom, siemens, hitachi, caf, and, bombardier, who, had, expressed, an, interest, in, supplying, 250, trains, for, between, 1, 0, billion, and, 2, 5, billion, and, on, the, same, day, opened, an, exhibition, with, a, design, by, priestmangoode, the, fully, automated, trains, may, be, able, to, run, without, drivers, but, the, aslef, and, rmt, trade, unions, that, represent, the, drivers, strongly, oppose, this, saying, it, would, affect, safety, the, invitation, to, tender, for, the, trains, was, issued, in, january, 2016, the, specifications, for, the, piccadilly, line, infrastructure, are, expected, in, 2016, and, the, first, train, is, due, to, run, on, the, piccadilly, line, in, 2023, siemens, mobility, s, inspiro, design, was, selected, in, june, 2018, in, a, 1, 5, billion, contract, when, the, bakerloo, line, opened, in, 1906, it, was, advertised, with, a, maximum, temperature, of, 60, f, 16, c, but, over, time, the, tube, tunnels, have, warmed, up, in, 1938, approval, was, given, for, a, ventilation, improvement, programme, and, a, refrigeration, unit, was, installed, in, a, lift, shaft, at, tottenham, court, road, temperatures, of, 117, f, 47, c, were, reported, in, the, 2006, european, heat, wave, it, was, claimed, in, 2002, that, if, animals, were, being, transported, temperatures, on, the, tube, would, break, european, commission, animal, welfare, laws, a, 2000, study, reported, that, air, quality, was, 73, times, worse, than, at, street, level, with, a, passenger, inhaling, the, same, mass, of, particulates, during, a, twenty, minute, journey, on, the, northern, line, as, when, smoking, a, cigarette, the, main, purpose, of, the, london, underground, s, ventilation, fans, is, to, extract, hot, air, from, the, tunnels, and, fans, across, the, network, are, being, refurbished, although, complaints, of, noise, from, local, residents, preclude, their, use, at, full, power, at, night, in, june, 2006, a, groundwater, cooling, system, was, installed, at, victoria, station, in, 2012, air, cooling, units, were, installed, on, platforms, at, green, park, station, using, cool, deep, groundwater, and, at, oxford, circus, using, chiller, units, at, the, top, of, an, adjacent, building, new, air, conditioned, trains, have, been, introduced, on, the, sub, surface, lines, but, were, initially, ruled, out, for, the, tube, trains, due, to, space, being, considered, limited, on, tube, trains, for, air, conditioning, units, and, that, these, would, heat, the, tunnels, even, more, the, new, tube, for, london, which, will, replace, the, trains, for, the, bakerloo, central, waterloo, and, city, and, piccadilly, lines, is, planned, to, have, air, conditioning, for, the, new, trains, along, with, better, energy, conservation, and, regenerative, braking, in, the, original, tube, design, trains, passing, through, close, fitting, tunnels, act, as, pistons, to, create, air, pressure, gradients, between, stations, this, pressure, difference, drives, ventilation, between, platforms, and, the, surface, exits, through, the, passenger, foot, network, this, system, depends, on, adequate, cross, sectional, area, of, the, airspace, above, the, passengers, heads, in, the, foot, tunnels, and, escalators, where, laminar, airflow, is, proportional, to, the, fourth, power, of, the, radius, the, hagen, poiseuille, equation, it, also, depends, on, an, absence, of, turbulence, in, the, tunnel, headspace, in, many, stations, the, ventilation, system, is, now, ineffective, because, of, alterations, that, reduce, tunnel, diameters, and, increase, turbulence, an, example, is, green, park, tube, station, where, false, ceiling, panels, attached, to, metal, frames, have, been, installed, that, reduce, the, above, head, airspace, diameter, by, more, than, half, in, many, parts, this, has, the, effect, of, reducing, laminar, airflow, by, 94, originally, air, turbulence, was, kept, to, a, minimum, by, keeping, all, signage, flat, to, the, tunnel, walls, now, the, ventilation, space, above, head, height, is, crowded, with, ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers, and, equipment, acting, as, a, baffle, plates, with, predictable, reductions, in, flow, often, electronic, signs, have, their, flat, surface, at, right, angles, to, the, main, air, flow, causing, choked, flow, temporary, sign, boards, that, stand, at, the, top, of, escalators, also, maximise, turbulence, the, alterations, to, the, ventilation, system, are, important, not, only, to, heat, exchange, originally, access, to, the, deep, tube, platforms, was, by, a, lift, each, lift, was, staffed, and, at, some, quiet, stations, in, the, 1920s, the, ticket, office, was, moved, into, the, lift, or, it, was, arranged, that, the, lift, could, be, controlled, from, the, ticket, office, the, first, escalator, on, the, london, underground, was, installed, in, 1911, between, the, district, and, piccadilly, platforms, at, earl, s, court, and, from, the, following, year, new, deep, level, stations, were, provided, with, escalators, instead, of, lifts, the, escalators, had, a, diagonal, shunt, at, the, top, landing, in, 1921, a, recorded, voice, instructed, passengers, to, stand, on, the, right, and, signs, followed, in, the, second, world, war, travellers, were, asked, to, stand, on, the, right, so, that, anyone, wishing, to, overtake, them, would, have, a, clear, passage, on, the, left, side, of, the, escalator, the, first, comb, type, escalator, was, installed, in, 1924, at, clapham, common, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, many, lifts, were, replaced, by, escalators, after, the, fatal, 1987, king, s, cross, fire, all, wooden, escalators, were, replaced, with, metal, ones, and, the, mechanisms, are, regularly, degreased, to, lower, the, potential, for, fires, the, only, wooden, escalator, not, to, be, replaced, was, at, greenford, station, which, remained, until, march, 2014, when, tfl, replaced, it, with, the, first, incline, lift, on, the, uk, transport, network, in, october, 2015, there, are, 426, escalators, on, the, london, underground, system, and, the, longest, at, 60, metres, 200, ft, is, at, angel, the, shortest, at, stratford, gives, a, vertical, rise, of, 4, 1, metres, 13, ft, there, are, 184, lifts, and, numbers, have, increased, in, recent, years, because, of, investment, in, making, tube, stations, accessible, over, 28, stations, will, have, lifts, installed, over, the, next, 10, years, bringing, the, total, of, step, free, stations, to, over, 100, lift, and, escalators, are, abundant, with, advertising, posters, which, can, be, used, for, artistic, purposes, due, to, the, nature, of, their, layout, in, mid, 2012, london, underground, in, partnership, with, virgin, media, trialled, wi, fi, hotspots, in, many, stations, but, not, in, the, tunnels, that, allowed, passengers, free, internet, access, the, free, trial, proved, successful, and, was, extended, to, the, end, of, 2012, whereupon, it, switched, to, a, service, freely, available, to, subscribers, to, virgin, media, and, others, or, as, a, paid, for, service, it, was, not, previously, possible, to, use, mobile, phones, on, most, parts, of, the, underground, excluding, services, running, overground, or, occasionally, sub, surface, depending, on, the, phone, and, carrier, using, native, 2g, 3g, or, 4g, networks, and, a, project, to, extend, coverage, before, the, 2012, olympics, was, abandoned, because, of, commercial, and, technical, difficulties, in, march, 2020, 2g, 3g, and, 4g, signal, was, made, available, on, parts, of, the, jubilee, line, between, westminster, and, canning, town, throughout, the, stations, and, tunnels, as, part, of, an, initial, trial, in, june, 2021, vodafone, dropped, london, underground, wi, fi, connectivity, across, the, entire, network, this, was, restored, in, april, 2023, after, control, of, the, wi, fi, connectivity, moved, from, virgin, media, to, boldyn, networks, as, part, of, their, 20, year, concession, deal, with, transport, for, london, providing, data, connectivity, across, the, entire, network, in, december, 2022, additional, mobile, coverage, including, 5g, connectivity, launched, at, a, small, subset, of, stations, and, tunnel, segments, on, the, central, line, with, a, view, to, expand, to, the, full, set, of, sub, surface, stations, and, tunnels, on, the, london, underground, and, also, the, elizabeth, line, by, the, end, of, 2024, further, stations, on, the, northern, line, were, launched, from, january, 2023, with, additional, northern, line, stations, also, being, added, in, june, 2023, not, all, stations, have, identical, coverage, solutions, with, some, not, having, 5g, connectivity, present, as, of, june, 2023, testing, has, begun, on, sections, of, the, bakerloo, piccadilly, and, victoria, lines, in, november, and, december, 2023, more, mobile, data, coverage, was, launched, on, more, stations, on, the, northern, and, central, lines, on, the, northern, line, all, stations, from, tottenham, court, road, to, euston, on, the, central, line, from, oxford, circus, to, chancery, lane, the, underground, received, 2, 669, billion, in, fares, in, 2016, 17, and, uses, transport, for, london, s, zonal, fare, system, to, calculate, fares, there, are, nine, zones, with, zone, 1, being, the, central, zone, which, includes, the, loop, of, the, circle, line, with, a, few, stations, to, the, south, of, river, thames, the, only, london, underground, stations, in, zones, 7, to, 9, are, on, the, metropolitan, line, beyond, moor, park, outside, london, region, some, stations, are, in, two, zones,
