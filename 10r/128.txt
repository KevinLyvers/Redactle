a, transistor, is, a, semiconductor, device, used, to, amplify, or, switch, electrical, signals, and, power, it, is, one, of, the, basic, building, blocks, of, modern, electronics, it, is, composed, of, semiconductor, material, usually, with, at, least, three, terminals, for, connection, to, an, electronic, circuit, a, voltage, or, current, applied, to, one, pair, of, the, transistor, s, terminals, controls, the, current, through, another, pair, of, terminals, because, the, controlled, output, power, can, be, higher, than, the, controlling, input, power, a, transistor, can, amplify, a, signal, some, transistors, are, packaged, individually, but, many, more, in, miniature, form, are, found, embedded, in, integrated, circuits, because, transistors, are, the, key, active, components, in, practically, all, modern, electronics, many, people, consider, them, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, greatest, inventions, physicist, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, proposed, the, concept, of, a, field, effect, transistor, fet, in, 1926, but, it, was, not, possible, to, construct, a, working, device, at, that, time, the, first, working, device, was, a, point, contact, transistor, invented, in, 1947, by, physicists, john, bardeen, walter, brattain, and, william, shockley, at, bell, labs, the, three, shared, the, 1956, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, achievement, the, most, widely, used, type, of, transistor, is, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, the, mosfet, was, invented, at, bell, labs, between, 1955, and, 1960, transistors, revolutionized, the, field, of, electronics, and, paved, the, way, for, smaller, and, cheaper, radios, calculators, computers, and, other, electronic, devices, most, transistors, are, made, from, very, pure, silicon, and, some, from, germanium, but, certain, other, semiconductor, materials, are, sometimes, used, a, transistor, may, have, only, one, kind, of, charge, carrier, in, a, field, effect, transistor, or, may, have, two, kinds, of, charge, carriers, in, bipolar, junction, transistor, devices, compared, with, the, vacuum, tube, transistors, are, generally, smaller, and, require, less, power, to, operate, certain, vacuum, tubes, have, advantages, over, transistors, at, very, high, operating, frequencies, or, high, operating, voltages, such, as, traveling, wave, tubes, and, gyrotrons, many, types, of, transistors, are, made, to, standardized, specifications, by, multiple, manufacturers, the, thermionic, triode, a, vacuum, tube, invented, in, 1907, enabled, amplified, radio, technology, and, long, distance, telephony, the, triode, however, was, a, fragile, device, that, consumed, a, substantial, amount, of, power, in, 1909, physicist, william, eccles, discovered, the, crystal, diode, oscillator, physicist, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, filed, a, patent, for, a, field, effect, transistor, fet, in, canada, in, 1925, intended, as, a, solid, state, replacement, for, the, triode, he, filed, identical, patents, in, the, united, states, in, 1926, and, 1928, however, he, did, not, publish, any, research, articles, about, his, devices, nor, did, his, patents, cite, any, specific, examples, of, a, working, prototype, because, the, production, of, high, quality, semiconductor, materials, was, still, decades, away, lilienfeld, s, solid, state, amplifier, ideas, would, not, have, found, practical, use, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, even, if, such, a, device, had, been, built, in, 1934, inventor, oskar, heil, patented, a, similar, device, in, europe, from, november, 17, to, december, 23, 1947, john, bardeen, and, walter, brattain, at, at, t, s, bell, labs, in, murray, hill, new, jersey, performed, experiments, and, observed, that, when, two, gold, point, contacts, were, applied, to, a, crystal, of, germanium, a, signal, was, produced, with, the, output, power, greater, than, the, input, solid, state, physics, group, leader, william, shockley, saw, the, potential, in, this, and, over, the, next, few, months, worked, to, greatly, expand, the, knowledge, of, semiconductors, the, term, transistor, was, coined, by, john, r, pierce, as, a, contraction, of, the, term, transresistance, according, to, lillian, hoddeson, and, vicki, daitch, shockley, proposed, that, bell, labs, first, patent, for, a, transistor, should, be, based, on, the, field, effect, and, that, he, be, named, as, the, inventor, having, unearthed, lilienfeld, s, patents, that, went, into, obscurity, years, earlier, lawyers, at, bell, labs, advised, against, shockley, s, proposal, because, the, idea, of, a, field, effect, transistor, that, used, an, electric, field, as, a, grid, was, not, new, instead, what, bardeen, brattain, and, shockley, invented, in, 1947, was, the, first, point, contact, transistor, to, acknowledge, this, accomplishment, shockley, bardeen, and, brattain, jointly, received, the, 1956, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, researches, on, semiconductors, and, their, discovery, of, the, transistor, effect, shockley, s, team, initially, attempted, to, build, a, field, effect, transistor, fet, by, trying, to, modulate, the, conductivity, of, a, semiconductor, but, was, unsuccessful, mainly, due, to, problems, with, the, surface, states, the, dangling, bond, and, the, germanium, and, copper, compound, materials, trying, to, understand, the, mysterious, reasons, behind, this, failure, led, them, instead, to, invent, the, bipolar, point, contact, and, junction, transistors, in, 1948, the, point, contact, transistor, was, independently, invented, by, physicists, herbert, matar, and, heinrich, welker, while, working, at, the, compagnie, des, freins, et, signaux, westinghouse, a, westinghouse, subsidiary, in, paris, matar, had, previous, experience, in, developing, crystal, rectifiers, from, silicon, and, germanium, in, the, german, radar, effort, during, world, war, ii, with, this, knowledge, he, began, researching, the, phenomenon, of, interference, in, 1947, by, june, 1948, witnessing, currents, flowing, through, point, contacts, he, produced, consistent, results, using, samples, of, germanium, produced, by, welker, similar, to, what, bardeen, and, brattain, had, accomplished, earlier, in, december, 1947, realizing, that, bell, labs, scientists, had, already, invented, the, transistor, the, company, rushed, to, get, its, transistron, into, production, for, amplified, use, in, france, s, telephone, network, filing, his, first, transistor, patent, application, on, august, 13, 1948, the, first, bipolar, junction, transistors, were, invented, by, bell, labs, william, shockley, who, applied, for, patent, 2, 569, 347, on, june, 26, 1948, on, april, 12, 1950, bell, labs, chemists, gordon, teal, and, morgan, sparks, successfully, produced, a, working, bipolar, npn, junction, amplifying, germanium, transistor, bell, announced, the, discovery, of, this, new, sandwich, transistor, in, a, press, release, on, july, 4, 1951, the, first, high, frequency, transistor, was, the, surface, barrier, germanium, transistor, developed, by, philco, in, 1953, capable, of, operating, at, frequencies, up, to, 60, mhz, they, were, made, by, etching, depressions, into, an, n, type, germanium, base, from, both, sides, with, jets, of, indium, iii, sulfate, until, it, was, a, few, ten, thousandths, of, an, inch, thick, indium, electroplated, into, the, depressions, formed, the, collector, and, emitter, at, t, first, used, transistors, in, telecommunications, equipment, in, the, no, 4a, toll, crossbar, switching, system, in, 1953, for, selecting, trunk, circuits, from, routing, information, encoded, on, translator, cards, its, predecessor, the, western, electric, no, 3a, phototransistor, read, the, mechanical, encoding, from, punched, metal, cards, the, first, prototype, pocket, transistor, radio, was, shown, by, intermetall, a, company, founded, by, herbert, matar, in, 1952, at, the, internationale, funkausstellung, d, sseldorf, from, august, 29, to, september, 6, 1953, the, first, production, model, pocket, transistor, radio, was, the, regency, tr, 1, released, in, october, 1954, produced, as, a, joint, venture, between, the, regency, division, of, industrial, development, engineering, associates, i, d, e, a, and, texas, instruments, of, dallas, texas, the, tr, 1, was, manufactured, in, indianapolis, indiana, it, was, a, near, pocket, sized, radio, with, four, transistors, and, one, germanium, diode, the, industrial, design, was, outsourced, to, the, chicago, firm, of, painter, teague, and, petertil, it, was, initially, released, in, one, of, six, colours, black, ivory, mandarin, red, cloud, grey, mahogany, and, olive, green, other, colours, shortly, followed, the, first, production, all, transistor, car, radio, was, developed, by, chrysler, and, philco, corporations, and, was, announced, in, the, april, 28, 1955, edition, of, the, wall, street, journal, chrysler, made, the, mopar, model, 914hr, available, as, an, option, starting, in, fall, 1955, for, its, new, line, of, 1956, chrysler, and, imperial, cars, which, reached, dealership, showrooms, on, october, 21, 1955, the, sony, tr, 63, released, in, 1957, was, the, first, mass, produced, transistor, radio, leading, to, the, widespread, adoption, of, transistor, radios, seven, million, tr, 63s, were, sold, worldwide, by, the, mid, 1960s, sony, s, success, with, transistor, radios, led, to, transistors, replacing, vacuum, tubes, as, the, dominant, electronic, technology, in, the, late, 1950s, the, first, working, silicon, transistor, was, developed, at, bell, labs, on, january, 26, 1954, by, morris, tanenbaum, the, first, production, commercial, silicon, transistor, was, announced, by, texas, instruments, in, may, 1954, this, was, the, work, of, gordon, teal, an, expert, in, growing, crystals, of, high, purity, who, had, previously, worked, at, bell, labs, the, basic, principle, of, the, field, effect, transistor, fet, was, first, proposed, by, physicist, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, when, he, filed, a, patent, for, a, device, similar, to, mesfet, in, 1926, and, for, an, insulated, gate, field, effect, transistor, in, 1928, the, fet, concept, was, later, also, theorized, by, engineer, oskar, heil, in, the, 1930s, and, by, william, shockley, in, the, 1940s, in, 1945, jfet, was, patented, by, heinrich, welker, following, shockley, s, theoretical, treatment, on, jfet, in, 1952, a, working, practical, jfet, was, made, in, 1953, by, george, c, dacey, and, ian, m, ross, in, 1948, bardeen, patented, the, progenitor, of, mosfet, an, insulated, gate, fet, igfet, with, an, inversion, layer, bardeen, s, patent, and, the, concept, of, an, inversion, layer, forms, the, basis, of, cmos, technology, today, in, the, early, years, of, the, semiconductor, industry, companies, focused, on, the, junction, transistor, a, relatively, bulky, device, that, was, difficult, to, mass, produce, limiting, it, to, several, specialized, applications, field, effect, transistors, fets, were, theorized, as, potential, alternatives, but, researchers, could, not, get, them, to, work, properly, largely, due, to, the, surface, state, barrier, that, prevented, the, external, electric, field, from, penetrating, the, material, in, 1955, carl, frosch, and, lincoln, derrick, accidentally, grew, a, layer, of, silicon, dioxide, over, the, silicon, wafer, for, which, they, observed, surface, passivation, effects, by, 1957, frosch, and, derrick, using, masking, and, predeposition, were, able, to, manufacture, silicon, dioxide, transistors, and, showed, that, silicon, dioxide, insulated, protected, silicon, wafers, and, prevented, dopants, from, diffusing, into, the, wafer, j, r, ligenza, and, w, g, spitzer, studied, the, mechanism, of, thermally, grown, oxides, and, fabricated, a, high, quality, si, sio, 2, stack, in, 1960, following, this, research, mohamed, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, proposed, a, silicon, mos, transistor, in, 1959, and, successfully, demonstrated, a, working, mos, device, with, their, bell, labs, team, in, 1960, their, team, included, e, e, labate, and, e, i, povilonis, who, fabricated, the, device, m, o, thurston, l, a, d, asaro, and, j, r, ligenza, who, developed, the, diffusion, processes, and, h, k, gummel, and, r, lindner, who, characterized, the, device, with, its, high, scalability, much, lower, power, consumption, and, higher, density, than, bipolar, junction, transistors, the, mosfet, made, it, possible, to, build, high, density, integrated, circuits, allowing, the, integration, of, more, than, 10, 000, transistors, in, a, single, ic, cmos, complementary, mos, was, invented, by, chih, tang, sah, and, frank, wanlass, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1963, the, first, report, of, a, floating, gate, mosfet, was, made, by, dawon, kahng, and, simon, sze, in, 1967, a, double, gate, mosfet, was, first, demonstrated, in, 1984, by, electrotechnical, laboratory, researchers, toshihiro, sekigawa, and, yutaka, hayashi, finfet, fin, field, effect, transistor, a, type, of, 3d, non, planar, multi, gate, mosfet, originated, from, the, research, of, digh, hisamoto, and, his, team, at, hitachi, central, research, laboratory, in, 1989, because, transistors, are, the, key, active, components, in, practically, all, modern, electronics, many, people, consider, them, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, greatest, inventions, the, invention, of, the, first, transistor, at, bell, labs, was, named, an, ieee, milestone, in, 2009, other, milestones, include, the, inventions, of, the, junction, transistor, in, 1948, and, the, mosfet, in, 1959, the, mosfet, is, by, far, the, most, widely, used, transistor, in, applications, ranging, from, computers, and, electronics, to, communications, technology, such, as, smartphones, it, has, been, considered, the, most, important, transistor, possibly, the, most, important, invention, in, electronics, and, the, device, that, enabled, modern, electronics, it, has, been, the, basis, of, modern, digital, electronics, since, the, late, 20th, century, paving, the, way, for, the, digital, age, the, us, patent, and, trademark, office, calls, it, a, groundbreaking, invention, that, transformed, life, and, culture, around, the, world, its, ability, to, be, mass, produced, by, a, highly, automated, process, semiconductor, device, fabrication, from, relatively, basic, materials, allows, astonishingly, low, per, transistor, costs, mosfets, are, the, most, numerously, produced, artificial, objects, in, history, with, more, than, 13, sextillion, manufactured, by, 2018, although, several, companies, each, produce, over, a, billion, individually, packaged, known, as, discrete, mos, transistors, every, year, the, vast, majority, are, produced, in, integrated, circuits, also, known, as, ics, microchips, or, simply, chips, along, with, diodes, resistors, capacitors, and, other, electronic, components, to, produce, complete, electronic, circuits, a, logic, gate, consists, of, up, to, about, 20, transistors, whereas, an, advanced, microprocessor, as, of, 2022, may, contain, as, many, as, 57, billion, mosfets, transistors, are, often, organized, into, logic, gates, in, microprocessors, to, perform, computation, the, transistor, s, low, cost, flexibility, and, reliability, have, made, it, ubiquitous, transistorized, mechatronic, circuits, have, replaced, electromechanical, devices, in, controlling, appliances, and, machinery, it, is, often, easier, and, cheaper, to, use, a, standard, microcontroller, and, write, a, computer, program, to, carry, out, a, control, function, than, to, design, an, equivalent, mechanical, system, a, transistor, can, use, a, small, signal, applied, between, one, pair, of, its, terminals, to, control, a, much, larger, signal, at, another, pair, of, terminals, a, property, called, gain, it, can, produce, a, stronger, output, signal, a, voltage, or, current, proportional, to, a, weaker, input, signal, acting, as, an, amplifier, it, can, also, be, used, as, an, electrically, controlled, switch, where, the, amount, of, current, is, determined, by, other, circuit, elements, there, are, two, types, of, transistors, with, slight, differences, in, how, they, are, used, the, top, image, in, this, section, represents, a, typical, bipolar, transistor, in, a, circuit, a, charge, flows, between, emitter, and, collector, terminals, depending, on, the, current, in, the, base, because, the, base, and, emitter, connections, behave, like, a, semiconductor, diode, a, voltage, drop, develops, between, them, the, amount, of, this, drop, determined, by, the, transistor, s, material, is, referred, to, as, v, be, base, emitter, voltage, transistors, are, commonly, used, in, digital, circuits, as, electronic, switches, which, can, be, either, in, an, on, or, off, state, both, for, high, power, applications, such, as, switched, mode, power, supplies, and, for, low, power, applications, such, as, logic, gates, important, parameters, for, this, application, include, the, current, switched, the, voltage, handled, and, the, switching, speed, characterized, by, the, rise, and, fall, times, in, a, switching, circuit, the, goal, is, to, simulate, as, near, as, possible, the, ideal, switch, having, the, properties, of, an, open, circuit, when, off, the, short, circuit, when, on, and, an, instantaneous, transition, between, the, two, states, parameters, are, chosen, such, that, the, off, output, is, limited, to, leakage, currents, too, small, to, affect, connected, circuitry, the, resistance, of, the, transistor, in, the, on, state, is, too, small, to, affect, circuitry, and, the, transition, between, the, two, states, is, fast, enough, not, to, have, a, detrimental, effect, in, a, grounded, emitter, transistor, circuit, such, as, the, light, switch, circuit, shown, as, the, base, voltage, rises, the, emitter, and, collector, currents, rise, exponentially, the, collector, voltage, drops, because, of, reduced, resistance, from, the, collector, to, the, emitter, if, the, voltage, difference, between, the, collector, and, emitter, were, zero, or, near, zero, the, collector, current, would, be, limited, only, by, the, load, resistance, light, bulb, and, the, supply, voltage, this, is, called, saturation, because, the, current, is, flowing, from, collector, to, emitter, freely, when, saturated, the, switch, is, said, to, be, on, the, use, of, bipolar, transistors, for, switching, applications, requires, biasing, the, transistor, so, that, it, operates, between, its, cut, off, region, in, the, off, state, and, the, saturation, region, on, this, requires, sufficient, base, drive, current, as, the, transistor, provides, current, gain, it, facilitates, the, switching, of, a, relatively, large, current, in, the, collector, by, a, much, smaller, current, into, the, base, terminal, the, ratio, of, these, currents, varies, depending, on, the, type, of, transistor, and, even, for, a, particular, type, varies, depending, on, the, collector, current, in, the, example, of, a, light, switch, circuit, as, shown, the, resistor, is, chosen, to, provide, enough, base, current, to, ensure, the, transistor, is, saturated, the, base, resistor, value, is, calculated, from, the, supply, voltage, transistor, c, e, junction, voltage, drop, collector, current, and, amplification, factor, beta, the, common, emitter, amplifier, is, designed, so, that, a, small, change, in, voltage, v, in, changes, the, small, current, through, the, base, of, the, transistor, whose, current, amplification, combined, with, the, properties, of, the, circuit, means, that, small, swings, in, v, in, produce, large, changes, in, v, out, various, configurations, of, single, transistor, amplifiers, are, possible, with, some, providing, current, gain, some, voltage, gain, and, some, both, from, mobile, phones, to, televisions, vast, numbers, of, products, include, amplifiers, for, sound, reproduction, radio, transmission, and, signal, processing, the, first, discrete, transistor, audio, amplifiers, barely, supplied, a, few, hundred, milliwatts, but, power, and, audio, fidelity, gradually, increased, as, better, transistors, became, available, and, amplifier, architecture, evolved, modern, transistor, audio, amplifiers, of, up, to, a, few, hundred, watts, are, common, and, relatively, inexpensive, before, transistors, were, developed, vacuum, electron, tubes, or, in, the, uk, thermionic, valves, or, just, valves, were, the, main, active, components, in, electronic, equipment, the, key, advantages, that, have, allowed, transistors, to, replace, vacuum, tubes, in, most, applications, are, transistors, may, have, the, following, limitations, transistors, are, categorized, by, hence, a, particular, transistor, may, be, described, as, silicon, surface, mount, bjt, npn, low, power, high, frequency, switch, convenient, mnemonic, to, remember, the, type, of, transistor, represented, by, an, electrical, symbol, involves, the, direction, of, the, arrow, for, the, bjt, on, an, n, p, n, transistor, symbol, the, arrow, will, n, ot, p, oint, i, n, on, a, p, n, p, transistor, symbol, the, arrow, p, oints, i, n, p, roudly, however, this, does, not, apply, to, mosfet, based, transistor, symbols, as, the, arrow, is, typically, reversed, i, e, the, arrow, for, the, n, p, n, points, inside, the, field, effect, transistor, sometimes, called, a, unipolar, transistor, uses, either, electrons, in, n, channel, fet, or, holes, in, p, channel, fet, for, conduction, the, four, terminals, of, the, fet, are, named, source, gate, drain, and, body, substrate, on, most, fets, the, body, is, connected, to, the, source, inside, the, package, and, this, will, be, assumed, for, the, following, description, in, a, fet, the, drain, to, source, current, flows, via, a, conducting, channel, that, connects, the, source, region, to, the, drain, region, the, conductivity, is, varied, by, the, electric, field, that, is, produced, when, a, voltage, is, applied, between, the, gate, and, source, terminals, hence, the, current, flowing, between, the, drain, and, source, is, controlled, by, the, voltage, applied, between, the, gate, and, source, as, the, gate, source, voltage, v, gs, is, increased, the, drain, source, current, i, ds, increases, exponentially, for, v, gs, below, threshold, and, then, at, a, roughly, quadratic, rate, i, ds, v, gs, v, t, 2, where, v, t, is, the, threshold, voltage, at, which, drain, current, begins, in, the, space, charge, limited, region, above, threshold, a, quadratic, behavior, is, not, observed, in, modern, devices, for, example, at, the, 65, nm, technology, node, for, low, noise, at, narrow, bandwidth, the, higher, input, resistance, of, the, fet, is, advantageous, fets, are, divided, into, two, families, junction, fet, jfet, and, insulated, gate, fet, igfet, the, igfet, is, more, commonly, known, as, a, metal, oxide, semiconductor, fet, mosfet, reflecting, its, original, construction, from, layers, of, metal, the, gate, oxide, the, insulation, and, semiconductor, unlike, igfets, the, jfet, gate, forms, a, p, n, diode, with, the, channel, which, lies, between, the, source, and, drains, functionally, this, makes, the, n, channel, jfet, the, solid, state, equivalent, of, the, vacuum, tube, triode, which, similarly, forms, a, diode, between, its, grid, and, cathode, also, both, devices, operate, in, the, depletion, mode, they, both, have, a, high, input, impedance, and, they, both, conduct, current, under, the, control, of, an, input, voltage, metal, semiconductor, fets, mesfets, are, jfets, in, which, the, reverse, biased, p, n, junction, is, replaced, by, a, metal, semiconductor, junction, these, and, the, hemts, high, electron, mobility, transistors, or, hfets, in, which, a, two, dimensional, electron, gas, with, very, high, carrier, mobility, is, used, for, charge, transport, are, especially, suitable, for, use, at, very, high, frequencies, several, ghz, fets, are, further, divided, into, depletion, mode, and, enhancement, mode, types, depending, on, whether, the, channel, is, turned, on, or, off, with, zero, gate, to, source, voltage, for, enhancement, mode, the, channel, is, off, at, zero, bias, and, a, gate, potential, can, enhance, the, conduction, for, the, depletion, mode, the, channel, is, on, at, zero, bias, and, a, gate, potential, of, the, opposite, polarity, can, deplete, the, channel, reducing, conduction, for, either, mode, a, more, positive, gate, voltage, corresponds, to, a, higher, current, for, n, channel, devices, and, a, lower, current, for, p, channel, devices, nearly, all, jfets, are, depletion, mode, because, the, diode, junctions, would, forward, bias, and, conduct, if, they, were, enhancement, mode, devices, while, most, igfets, are, enhancement, mode, types, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, mos, fet, or, mos, fet, also, known, as, the, metal, oxide, silicon, transistor, mos, transistor, or, mos, is, a, type, of, field, effect, transistor, that, is, fabricated, by, the, controlled, oxidation, of, a, semiconductor, typically, silicon, it, has, an, insulated, gate, whose, voltage, determines, the, conductivity, of, the, device, this, ability, to, change, conductivity, with, the, amount, of, applied, voltage, can, be, used, for, amplifying, or, switching, electronic, signals, the, mosfet, is, by, far, the, most, common, transistor, and, the, basic, building, block, of, most, modern, electronics, the, mosfet, accounts, for, 99, 9, of, all, transistors, in, the, world, bipolar, transistors, are, so, named, because, they, conduct, by, using, both, majority, and, minority, carriers, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, the, first, type, of, transistor, to, be, mass, produced, is, a, combination, of, two, junction, diodes, and, is, formed, of, either, a, thin, layer, of, p, type, semiconductor, sandwiched, between, two, n, type, semiconductors, an, n, p, n, transistor, or, a, thin, layer, of, n, type, semiconductor, sandwiched, between, two, p, type, semiconductors, a, p, n, p, transistor, this, construction, produces, two, p, n, junctions, a, base, emitter, junction, and, a, base, collector, junction, separated, by, a, thin, region, of, semiconductor, known, as, the, base, region, two, junction, diodes, wired, together, without, sharing, an, intervening, semiconducting, region, will, not, make, a, transistor, bjts, have, three, terminals, corresponding, to, the, three, layers, of, semiconductor, an, emitter, a, base, and, a, collector, they, are, useful, in, amplifiers, because, the, currents, at, the, emitter, and, collector, are, controllable, by, a, relatively, small, base, current, in, an, n, p, n, transistor, operating, in, the, active, region, the, emitter, base, junction, is, forward, biased, electrons, and, holes, recombine, at, the, junction, and, the, base, collector, junction, is, reverse, biased, electrons, and, holes, are, formed, at, and, move, away, from, the, junction, and, electrons, are, injected, into, the, base, region, because, the, base, is, narrow, most, of, these, electrons, will, diffuse, into, the, reverse, biased, base, collector, junction, and, be, swept, into, the, collector, perhaps, one, hundredth, of, the, electrons, will, recombine, in, the, base, which, is, the, dominant, mechanism, in, the, base, current, as, well, as, the, base, is, lightly, doped, in, comparison, to, the, emitter, and, collector, regions, recombination, rates, are, low, permitting, more, carriers, to, diffuse, across, the, base, region, by, controlling, the, number, of, electrons, that, can, leave, the, base, the, number, of, electrons, entering, the, collector, can, be, controlled, collector, current, is, approximately, common, emitter, current, gain, times, the, base, current, it, is, typically, greater, than, 100, for, small, signal, transistors, but, can, be, smaller, in, transistors, designed, for, high, power, applications, unlike, the, field, effect, transistor, see, below, the, bjt, is, a, low, input, impedance, device, also, as, the, base, emitter, voltage, v, be, is, increased, the, base, emitter, current, and, hence, the, collector, emitter, current, i, ce, increase, exponentially, according, to, the, shockley, diode, model, and, the, ebers, moll, model, because, of, this, exponential, relationship, the, bjt, has, a, higher, transconductance, than, the, fet, bipolar, transistors, can, be, made, to, conduct, by, exposure, to, light, because, the, absorption, of, photons, in, the, base, region, generates, a, photocurrent, that, acts, as, a, base, current, the, collector, current, is, approximately, times, the, photocurrent, devices, designed, for, this, purpose, have, a, transparent, window, in, the, package, and, are, called, phototransistors, the, mosfet, is, by, far, the, most, widely, used, transistor, for, both, digital, circuits, as, well, as, analog, circuits, accounting, for, 99, 9, of, all, transistors, in, the, world, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, bjt, was, previously, the, most, commonly, used, transistor, during, the, 1950s, to, 1960s, even, after, mosfets, became, widely, available, in, the, 1970s, the, bjt, remained, the, transistor, of, choice, for, many, analog, circuits, such, as, amplifiers, because, of, their, greater, linearity, up, until, mosfet, devices, such, as, power, mosfets, ldmos, and, rf, cmos, replaced, them, for, most, power, electronic, applications, in, the, 1980s, in, integrated, circuits, the, desirable, properties, of, mosfets, allowed, them, to, capture, nearly, all, market, share, for, digital, circuits, in, the, 1970s, discrete, mosfets, typically, power, mosfets, can, be, applied, in, transistor, applications, including, analog, circuits, voltage, regulators, amplifiers, power, transmitters, and, motor, drivers, three, major, identification, standards, are, used, for, designating, transistor, devices, in, each, the, alphanumeric, prefix, provides, clues, to, the, type, of, the, device, the, jedec, part, numbering, scheme, evolved, in, the, 1960s, in, the, united, states, the, jedec, eia, 370, transistor, device, numbers, usually, start, with, 2n, indicating, a, three, terminal, device, dual, gate, field, effect, transistors, are, four, terminal, devices, and, begin, with, 3n, the, prefix, is, followed, by, a, two, three, or, four, digit, number, with, no, significance, as, to, device, properties, although, early, devices, with, low, numbers, tend, to, be, germanium, devices, for, example, 2n3055, is, a, silicon, n, p, n, power, transistor, 2n1301, is, a, p, n, p, germanium, switching, transistor, a, letter, suffix, such, as, a, is, sometimes, used, to, indicate, a, newer, variant, but, rarely, gain, groupings, in, japan, the, jis, semiconductor, designation, jis, c, 7012, labels, transistor, devices, starting, with, 2s, e, g, 2sd965, but, sometimes, the, 2s, prefix, is, not, marked, on, the, package, a, 2sd965, might, only, be, marked, d965, and, a, 2sc1815, might, be, listed, by, a, supplier, as, simply, c1815, this, series, sometimes, has, suffixes, such, as, r, o, bl, standing, for, red, orange, blue, etc, to, denote, variants, such, as, tighter, h, fe, gain, groupings, the, european, electronic, component, manufacturers, association, eeca, uses, a, numbering, scheme, that, was, inherited, from, pro, electron, when, it, merged, with, eeca, in, 1983, this, scheme, begins, with, two, letters, the, first, gives, the, semiconductor, type, a, for, germanium, b, for, silicon, and, c, for, materials, like, gaas, the, second, letter, denotes, the, intended, use, a, for, diode, c, for, general, purpose, transistor, etc, a, three, digit, sequence, number, or, one, letter, and, two, digits, for, industrial, types, follows, with, early, devices, this, indicated, the, case, type, suffixes, may, be, used, with, a, letter, e, g, c, often, means, high, h, fe, such, as, in, bc549c, or, other, codes, may, follow, to, show, gain, e, g, bc327, 25, or, voltage, rating, e, g, buk854, 800a, the, more, common, prefixes, are, manufacturers, of, devices, may, have, their, proprietary, numbering, system, for, example, ck722, since, devices, are, second, sourced, a, manufacturer, s, prefix, like, mpf, in, mpf102, which, originally, would, denote, a, motorola, fet, now, is, an, unreliable, indicator, of, who, made, the, device, some, proprietary, naming, schemes, adopt, parts, of, other, naming, schemes, for, example, a, pn2222a, is, a, possibly, fairchild, semiconductor, 2n2222a, in, a, plastic, case, but, a, pn108, is, a, plastic, version, of, a, bc108, not, a, 2n108, while, the, pn100, is, unrelated, to, other, xx100, devices, military, part, numbers, sometimes, are, assigned, their, codes, such, as, the, british, military, cv, naming, system, manufacturers, buying, large, numbers, of, similar, parts, may, have, them, supplied, with, house, numbers, identifying, a, particular, purchasing, specification, and, not, necessarily, a, device, with, a, standardized, registered, number, for, example, an, hp, part, 1854, 0053, is, a, jedec, 2n2218, transistor, which, is, also, assigned, the, cv, number, cv7763, with, so, many, independent, naming, schemes, and, the, abbreviation, of, part, numbers, when, printed, on, the, devices, ambiguity, sometimes, occurs, for, example, two, different, devices, may, be, marked, j176, one, the, j176, low, power, jfet, the, other, the, higher, powered, mosfet, 2sj176, as, older, through, hole, transistors, are, given, surface, mount, packaged, counterparts, they, tend, to, be, assigned, many, different, part, numbers, because, manufacturers, have, their, systems, to, cope, with, the, variety, in, pinout, arrangements, and, options, for, dual, or, matched, n, p, n, p, n, p, devices, in, one, pack, so, even, when, the, original, device, such, as, a, 2n3904, may, have, been, assigned, by, a, standards, authority, and, well, known, by, engineers, over, the, years, the, new, versions, are, far, from, standardized, in, their, naming, the, first, bjts, were, made, from, germanium, ge, silicon, si, types, currently, predominate, but, certain, advanced, microwave, and, high, performance, versions, now, employ, the, compound, semiconductor, material, gallium, arsenide, gaas, and, the, semiconductor, alloy, silicon, germanium, sige, single, element, semiconductor, material, ge, and, si, is, described, as, elemental, rough, parameters, for, the, most, common, semiconductor, materials, used, to, make, transistors, are, given, in, the, adjacent, table, these, parameters, will, vary, with, an, increase, in, temperature, electric, field, impurity, level, strain, and, sundry, other, factors, the, junction, forward, voltage, is, the, voltage, applied, to, the, emitter, base, junction, of, a, bjt, to, make, the, base, conduct, a, specified, current, the, current, increases, exponentially, as, the, junction, forward, voltage, is, increased, the, values, given, in, the, table, are, typical, for, a, current, of, 1, ma, the, same, values, apply, to, semiconductor, diodes, the, lower, the, junction, forward, voltage, the, better, as, this, means, that, less, power, is, required, to, drive, the, transistor, the, junction, forward, voltage, for, a, given, current, decreases, with, an, increase, in, temperature, for, a, typical, silicon, junction, the, change, is, 2, 1, mv, c, in, some, circuits, special, compensating, elements, sensistors, must, be, used, to, compensate, for, such, changes, the, density, of, mobile, carriers, in, the, channel, of, a, mosfet, is, a, function, of, the, electric, field, forming, the, channel, and, of, various, other, phenomena, such, as, the, impurity, level, in, the, channel, some, impurities, called, dopants, are, introduced, deliberately, in, making, a, mosfet, to, control, the, mosfet, electrical, behavior, the, electron, mobility, and, hole, mobility, columns, show, the, average, speed, that, electrons, and, holes, diffuse, through, the, semiconductor, material, with, an, electric, field, of, 1, volt, per, meter, applied, across, the, material, in, general, the, higher, the, electron, mobility, the, faster, the, transistor, can, operate, the, table, indicates, that, ge, is, a, better, material, than, si, in, this, respect, however, ge, has, four, major, shortcomings, compared, to, silicon, and, gallium, arsenide, because, the, electron, mobility, is, higher, than, the, hole, mobility, for, all, semiconductor, materials, a, given, bipolar, n, p, n, transistor, tends, to, be, swifter, than, an, equivalent, p, n, p, transistor, gaas, has, the, highest, electron, mobility, of, the, three, semiconductors, it, is, for, this, reason, that, gaas, is, used, in, high, frequency, applications, a, relatively, recent, fet, development, the, high, electron, mobility, transistor, hemt, has, a, heterostructure, junction, between, different, semiconductor, materials, of, aluminium, gallium, arsenide, algaas, gallium, arsenide, gaas, which, has, twice, the, electron, mobility, of, a, gaas, metal, barrier, junction, because, of, their, high, speed, and, low, noise, hemts, are, used, in, satellite, receivers, working, at, frequencies, around, 12, ghz, hemts, based, on, gallium, nitride, and, aluminum, gallium, nitride, algan, gan, hemts, provide, still, higher, electron, mobility, and, are, being, developed, for, various, applications, maximum, junction, temperature, values, represent, a, cross, section, taken, from, various, manufacturers, datasheets, this, temperature, should, not, be, exceeded, or, the, transistor, may, be, damaged, al, si, junction, refers, to, the, high, speed, aluminum, silicon, metal, semiconductor, barrier, diode, commonly, known, as, a, schottky, diode, this, is, included, in, the, table, because, some, silicon, power, igfets, have, a, parasitic, reverse, schottky, diode, formed, between, the, source, and, drain, as, part, of, the, fabrication, process, this, diode, can, be, a, nuisance, but, sometimes, it, is, used, in, the, circuit, discrete, transistors, can, be, individually, packaged, transistors, or, unpackaged, transistor, chips, transistors, come, in, many, different, semiconductor, packages, see, image, the, two, main, categories, are, through, hole, or, leaded, and, surface, mount, also, known, as, surface, mount, device, smd, the, ball, grid, array, bga, is, the, latest, surface, mount, package, it, has, solder, balls, on, the, underside, in, place, of, leads, because, they, are, smaller, and, have, shorter, interconnections, smds, have, better, high, frequency, characteristics, but, lower, power, ratings, transistor, packages, are, made, of, glass, metal, ceramic, or, plastic, the, package, often, dictates, the, power, rating, and, frequency, characteristics, power, transistors, have, larger, packages, that, can, be, clamped, to, heat, sinks, for, enhanced, cooling, additionally, most, power, transistors, have, the, collector, or, drain, physically, connected, to, the, metal, enclosure, at, the, other, extreme, some, surface, mount, microwave, transistors, are, as, small, as, grains, of, sand, often, a, given, transistor, type, is, available, in, several, packages, transistor, packages, are, mainly, standardized, but, the, assignment, of, a, transistor, s, functions, to, the, terminals, is, not, other, transistor, types, can, assign, other, functions, to, the, package, s, terminals, even, for, the, same, transistor, type, the, terminal, assignment, can, vary, normally, indicated, by, a, suffix, letter, to, the, part, number, q, e, bc212l, and, bc212k, nowadays, most, transistors, come, in, a, wide, range, of, smt, packages, in, comparison, the, list, of, available, through, hole, packages, is, relatively, small, here, is, a, short, list, of, the, most, common, through, hole, transistors, packages, in, alphabetical, order, atv, e, line, mrt, hrt, sc, 43, sc, 72, to, 3, to, 18, to, 39, to, 92, to, 126, to220, to247, to251, to262, ztx851, unpackaged, transistor, chips, die, may, be, assembled, into, hybrid, devices, the, ibm, slt, module, of, the, 1960s, is, one, example, of, such, a, hybrid, circuit, module, using, glass, passivated, transistor, and, diode, die, other, packaging, techniques, for, discrete, transistors, as, chips, include, direct, chip, attach, dca, and, chip, on, board, cob, researchers, have, made, several, kinds, of, flexible, transistors, including, organic, field, effect, transistors, flexible, transistors, are, useful, in, some, kinds, of, flexible, displays, and, other, flexible, electronics
