a, machine, is, a, physical, system, that, uses, power, to, apply, forces, and, control, movement, to, perform, an, action, the, term, is, commonly, applied, to, artificial, devices, such, as, those, employing, engines, or, motors, but, also, to, natural, biological, macromolecules, such, as, molecular, machines, machines, can, be, driven, by, animals, and, people, by, natural, forces, such, as, wind, and, water, and, by, chemical, thermal, or, electrical, power, and, include, a, system, of, mechanisms, that, shape, the, actuator, input, to, achieve, a, specific, application, of, output, forces, and, movement, they, can, also, include, computers, and, sensors, that, monitor, performance, and, plan, movement, often, called, mechanical, systems, renaissance, natural, philosophers, identified, six, simple, machines, which, were, the, elementary, devices, that, put, a, load, into, motion, and, calculated, the, ratio, of, output, force, to, input, force, known, today, as, mechanical, advantage, modern, machines, are, complex, systems, that, consist, of, structural, elements, mechanisms, and, control, components, and, include, interfaces, for, convenient, use, examples, include, a, wide, range, of, vehicles, such, as, trains, automobiles, boats, and, airplanes, appliances, in, the, home, and, office, including, computers, building, air, handling, and, water, handling, systems, as, well, as, farm, machinery, machine, tools, and, factory, automation, systems, and, robots, the, english, word, machine, comes, through, middle, french, from, latin, machina, which, in, turn, derives, from, the, greek, doric, makhana, ionic, mekhane, contrivance, machine, engine, a, derivation, from, mekhos, means, expedient, remedy, the, word, mechanical, greek, comes, from, the, same, greek, roots, a, wider, meaning, of, fabric, structure, is, found, in, classical, latin, but, not, in, greek, usage, this, meaning, is, found, in, late, medieval, french, and, is, adopted, from, the, french, into, english, in, the, mid, 16th, century, in, the, 17th, century, the, word, machine, could, also, mean, a, scheme, or, plot, a, meaning, now, expressed, by, the, derived, machination, the, modern, meaning, develops, out, of, specialized, application, of, the, term, to, stage, engines, used, in, theater, and, to, military, siege, engines, both, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, the, oed, traces, the, formal, modern, meaning, to, john, harris, lexicon, technicum, 1704, which, has, the, word, engine, used, as, a, near, synonym, both, by, harris, and, in, later, language, derives, ultimately, via, old, french, from, latin, ingenium, ingenuity, an, invention, the, hand, axe, made, by, chipping, flint, to, form, a, wedge, in, the, hands, of, a, human, transforms, force, and, movement, of, the, tool, into, a, transverse, splitting, forces, and, movement, of, the, workpiece, the, hand, axe, is, the, first, example, of, a, wedge, the, oldest, of, the, six, classic, simple, machines, from, which, most, machines, are, based, the, second, oldest, simple, machine, was, the, inclined, plane, ramp, which, has, been, used, since, prehistoric, times, to, move, heavy, objects, the, other, four, simple, machines, were, invented, in, the, ancient, near, east, the, wheel, along, with, the, wheel, and, axle, mechanism, was, invented, in, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, during, the, 5th, millennium, bc, the, lever, mechanism, first, appeared, around, 5, 000, years, ago, in, the, near, east, where, it, was, used, in, a, simple, balance, scale, and, to, move, large, objects, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, the, lever, was, also, used, in, the, shadoof, water, lifting, device, the, first, crane, machine, which, appeared, in, mesopotamia, c, 3000, bc, and, then, in, ancient, egyptian, technology, c, 2000, bc, the, earliest, evidence, of, pulleys, date, back, to, mesopotamia, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, and, ancient, egypt, during, the, twelfth, dynasty, 1991, 1802, bc, the, screw, the, last, of, the, simple, machines, to, be, invented, first, appeared, in, mesopotamia, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, 911, 609, bc, the, egyptian, pyramids, were, built, using, three, of, the, six, simple, machines, the, inclined, plane, the, wedge, and, the, lever, three, of, the, simple, machines, were, studied, and, described, by, greek, philosopher, archimedes, around, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, lever, pulley, and, screw, archimedes, discovered, the, principle, of, mechanical, advantage, in, the, lever, later, greek, philosophers, defined, the, classic, five, simple, machines, excluding, the, inclined, plane, and, were, able, to, roughly, calculate, their, mechanical, advantage, hero, of, alexandria, c, 10, 75, ad, in, his, work, mechanics, lists, five, mechanisms, that, can, set, a, load, in, motion, lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and, screw, and, describes, their, fabrication, and, uses, however, the, greeks, understanding, was, limited, to, statics, the, balance, of, forces, and, did, not, include, dynamics, the, tradeoff, between, force, and, distance, or, the, concept, of, work, the, earliest, practical, wind, powered, machines, the, windmill, and, wind, pump, first, appeared, in, the, muslim, world, during, the, islamic, golden, age, in, what, are, now, iran, afghanistan, and, pakistan, by, the, 9th, century, ad, the, earliest, practical, steam, powered, machine, was, a, steam, jack, driven, by, a, steam, turbine, described, in, 1551, by, taqi, ad, din, muhammad, ibn, ma, ruf, in, ottoman, egypt, the, cotton, gin, was, invented, in, india, by, the, 6th, century, ad, and, the, spinning, wheel, was, invented, in, the, islamic, world, by, the, early, 11th, century, both, of, which, were, fundamental, to, the, growth, of, the, cotton, industry, the, spinning, wheel, was, also, a, precursor, to, the, spinning, jenny, the, earliest, programmable, machines, were, developed, in, the, muslim, world, a, music, sequencer, a, programmable, musical, instrument, was, the, earliest, type, of, programmable, machine, the, first, music, sequencer, was, an, automated, flute, player, invented, by, the, banu, musa, brothers, described, in, their, book, of, ingenious, devices, in, the, 9th, century, in, 1206, al, jazari, invented, programmable, automata, robots, he, described, four, automaton, musicians, including, drummers, operated, by, a, programmable, drum, machine, where, they, could, be, made, to, play, different, rhythms, and, different, drum, patterns, during, the, renaissance, the, dynamics, of, the, mechanical, powers, as, the, simple, machines, were, called, began, to, be, studied, from, the, standpoint, of, how, much, useful, work, they, could, perform, leading, eventually, to, the, new, concept, of, mechanical, work, in, 1586, flemish, engineer, simon, stevin, derived, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, inclined, plane, and, it, was, included, with, the, other, simple, machines, the, complete, dynamic, theory, of, simple, machines, was, worked, out, by, italian, scientist, galileo, galilei, in, 1600, in, le, meccaniche, on, mechanics, he, was, the, first, to, understand, that, simple, machines, do, not, create, energy, they, merely, transform, it, the, classic, rules, of, sliding, friction, in, machines, were, discovered, by, leonardo, da, vinci, 1452, 1519, but, remained, unpublished, in, his, notebooks, they, were, rediscovered, by, guillaume, amontons, 1699, and, were, further, developed, by, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, 1785, james, watt, patented, his, parallel, motion, linkage, in, 1782, which, made, the, double, acting, steam, engine, practical, the, boulton, and, watt, steam, engine, and, later, designs, powered, steam, locomotives, steam, ships, and, factories, the, industrial, revolution, was, a, period, from, 1750, to, 1850, where, changes, in, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and, technology, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, social, economic, and, cultural, conditions, of, the, times, it, began, in, the, united, kingdom, then, subsequently, spread, throughout, western, europe, north, america, japan, and, eventually, the, rest, of, the, world, starting, in, the, later, part, of, the, 18th, century, there, began, a, transition, in, parts, of, great, britain, s, previously, manual, labour, and, draft, animal, based, economy, towards, machine, based, manufacturing, it, started, with, the, mechanisation, of, the, textile, industries, the, development, of, iron, making, techniques, and, the, increased, use, of, refined, coal, the, idea, that, a, machine, can, be, decomposed, into, simple, movable, elements, led, archimedes, to, define, the, lever, pulley, and, screw, as, simple, machines, by, the, time, of, the, renaissance, this, list, increased, to, include, the, wheel, and, axle, wedge, and, inclined, plane, the, modern, approach, to, characterizing, machines, focusses, on, the, components, that, allow, movement, known, as, joints, wedge, hand, axe, perhaps, the, first, example, of, a, device, designed, to, manage, power, is, the, hand, axe, also, called, biface, and, olorgesailie, a, hand, axe, is, made, by, chipping, stone, generally, flint, to, form, a, bifacial, edge, or, wedge, a, wedge, is, a, simple, machine, that, transforms, lateral, force, and, movement, of, the, tool, into, a, transverse, splitting, force, and, movement, of, the, workpiece, the, available, power, is, limited, by, the, effort, of, the, person, using, the, tool, but, because, power, is, the, product, of, force, and, movement, the, wedge, amplifies, the, force, by, reducing, the, movement, this, amplification, or, mechanical, advantage, is, the, ratio, of, the, input, speed, to, output, speed, for, a, wedge, this, is, given, by, 1, tan, where, is, the, tip, angle, the, faces, of, a, wedge, are, modeled, as, straight, lines, to, form, a, sliding, or, prismatic, joint, lever, the, lever, is, another, important, and, simple, device, for, managing, power, this, is, a, body, that, pivots, on, a, fulcrum, because, the, velocity, of, a, point, farther, from, the, pivot, is, greater, than, the, velocity, of, a, point, near, the, pivot, forces, applied, far, from, the, pivot, are, amplified, near, the, pivot, by, the, associated, decrease, in, speed, if, a, is, the, distance, from, the, pivot, to, the, point, where, the, input, force, is, applied, and, b, is, the, distance, to, the, point, where, the, output, force, is, applied, then, a, b, is, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, lever, the, fulcrum, of, a, lever, is, modeled, as, a, hinged, or, revolute, joint, wheel, the, wheel, is, an, important, early, machine, such, as, the, chariot, a, wheel, uses, the, law, of, the, lever, to, reduce, the, force, needed, to, overcome, friction, when, pulling, a, load, to, see, this, notice, that, the, friction, associated, with, pulling, a, load, on, the, ground, is, approximately, the, same, as, the, friction, in, a, simple, bearing, that, supports, the, load, on, the, axle, of, a, wheel, however, the, wheel, forms, a, lever, that, magnifies, the, pulling, force, so, that, it, overcomes, the, frictional, resistance, in, the, bearing, the, classification, of, simple, machines, to, provide, a, strategy, for, the, design, of, new, machines, was, developed, by, franz, reuleaux, who, collected, and, studied, over, 800, elementary, machines, he, recognized, that, the, classical, simple, machines, can, be, separated, into, the, lever, pulley, and, wheel, and, axle, that, are, formed, by, a, body, rotating, about, a, hinge, and, the, inclined, plane, wedge, and, screw, that, are, similarly, a, block, sliding, on, a, flat, surface, simple, machines, are, elementary, examples, of, kinematic, chains, or, linkages, that, are, used, to, model, mechanical, systems, ranging, from, the, steam, engine, to, robot, manipulators, the, bearings, that, form, the, fulcrum, of, a, lever, and, that, allow, the, wheel, and, axle, and, pulleys, to, rotate, are, examples, of, a, kinematic, pair, called, a, hinged, joint, similarly, the, flat, surface, of, an, inclined, plane, and, wedge, are, examples, of, the, kinematic, pair, called, a, sliding, joint, the, screw, is, usually, identified, as, its, own, kinematic, pair, called, a, helical, joint, this, realization, shows, that, it, is, the, joints, or, the, connections, that, provide, movement, that, are, the, primary, elements, of, a, machine, starting, with, four, types, of, joints, the, rotary, joint, sliding, joint, cam, joint, and, gear, joint, and, related, connections, such, as, cables, and, belts, it, is, possible, to, understand, a, machine, as, an, assembly, of, solid, parts, that, connect, these, joints, called, a, mechanism, two, levers, or, cranks, are, combined, into, a, planar, four, bar, linkage, by, attaching, a, link, that, connects, the, output, of, one, crank, to, the, input, of, another, additional, links, can, be, attached, to, form, a, six, bar, linkage, or, in, series, to, form, a, robot, a, mechanical, system, manages, power, to, accomplish, a, task, that, involves, forces, and, movement, modern, machines, are, systems, consisting, of, i, a, power, source, and, actuators, that, generate, forces, and, movement, ii, a, system, of, mechanisms, that, shape, the, actuator, input, to, achieve, a, specific, application, of, output, forces, and, movement, iii, a, controller, with, sensors, that, compare, the, output, to, a, performance, goal, and, then, directs, the, actuator, input, and, iv, an, interface, to, an, operator, consisting, of, levers, switches, and, displays, this, can, be, seen, in, watt, s, steam, engine, in, which, the, power, is, provided, by, steam, expanding, to, drive, the, piston, the, walking, beam, coupler, and, crank, transform, the, linear, movement, of, the, piston, into, rotation, of, the, output, pulley, finally, the, pulley, rotation, drives, the, flyball, governor, which, controls, the, valve, for, the, steam, input, to, the, piston, cylinder, the, adjective, mechanical, refers, to, skill, in, the, practical, application, of, an, art, or, science, as, well, as, relating, to, or, caused, by, movement, physical, forces, properties, or, agents, such, as, is, dealt, with, by, mechanics, similarly, merriam, webster, dictionary, defines, mechanical, as, relating, to, machinery, or, tools, power, flow, through, a, machine, provides, a, way, to, understand, the, performance, of, devices, ranging, from, levers, and, gear, trains, to, automobiles, and, robotic, systems, the, german, mechanician, franz, reuleaux, wrote, a, machine, is, a, combination, of, resistant, bodies, so, arranged, that, by, their, means, the, mechanical, forces, of, nature, can, be, compelled, to, do, work, accompanied, by, certain, determinate, motion, notice, that, forces, and, motion, combine, to, define, power, more, recently, uicker, et, al, stated, that, a, machine, is, a, device, for, applying, power, or, changing, its, direction, mccarthy, and, soh, describe, a, machine, as, a, system, that, generally, consists, of, a, power, source, and, a, mechanism, for, the, controlled, use, of, this, power, human, and, animal, effort, were, the, original, power, sources, for, early, machines, waterwheel, waterwheels, appeared, around, the, world, around, 300, bc, to, use, flowing, water, to, generate, rotary, motion, which, was, applied, to, milling, grain, and, powering, lumber, machining, and, textile, operations, modern, water, turbines, use, water, flowing, through, a, dam, to, drive, an, electric, generator, windmill, early, windmills, captured, wind, power, to, generate, rotary, motion, for, milling, operations, modern, wind, turbines, also, drives, a, generator, this, electricity, in, turn, is, used, to, drive, motors, forming, the, actuators, of, mechanical, systems, engine, the, word, engine, derives, from, ingenuity, and, originally, referred, to, contrivances, that, may, or, may, not, be, physical, devices, a, steam, engine, uses, heat, to, boil, water, contained, in, a, pressure, vessel, the, expanding, steam, drives, a, piston, or, a, turbine, this, principle, can, be, seen, in, the, aeolipile, of, hero, of, alexandria, this, is, called, an, external, combustion, engine, an, automobile, engine, is, called, an, internal, combustion, engine, because, it, burns, fuel, an, exothermic, chemical, reaction, inside, a, cylinder, and, uses, the, expanding, gases, to, drive, a, piston, a, jet, engine, uses, a, turbine, to, compress, air, which, is, burned, with, fuel, so, that, it, expands, through, a, nozzle, to, provide, thrust, to, an, aircraft, and, so, is, also, an, internal, combustion, engine, power, plant, the, heat, from, coal, and, natural, gas, combustion, in, a, boiler, generates, steam, that, drives, a, steam, turbine, to, rotate, an, electric, generator, a, nuclear, power, plant, uses, heat, from, a, nuclear, reactor, to, generate, steam, and, electric, power, this, power, is, distributed, through, a, network, of, transmission, lines, for, industrial, and, individual, use, motors, electric, motors, use, either, ac, or, dc, electric, current, to, generate, rotational, movement, electric, servomotors, are, the, actuators, for, mechanical, systems, ranging, from, robotic, systems, to, modern, aircraft, fluid, power, hydraulic, and, pneumatic, systems, use, electrically, driven, pumps, to, drive, water, or, air, respectively, into, cylinders, to, power, linear, movement, electrochemical, chemicals, and, materials, can, also, be, sources, of, power, they, may, chemically, deplete, or, need, re, charging, as, is, the, case, with, batteries, or, they, may, produce, power, without, changing, their, state, which, is, the, case, for, solar, cells, and, thermoelectric, generators, all, of, these, however, still, require, their, energy, to, come, from, elsewhere, with, batteries, it, is, the, already, existing, chemical, potential, energy, inside, in, solar, cells, and, thermoelectrics, the, energy, source, is, light, and, heat, respectively, the, mechanism, of, a, mechanical, system, is, assembled, from, components, called, machine, elements, these, elements, provide, structure, for, the, system, and, control, its, movement, the, structural, components, are, generally, the, frame, members, bearings, splines, springs, seals, fasteners, and, covers, the, shape, texture, and, color, of, covers, provide, a, styling, and, operational, interface, between, the, mechanical, system, and, its, users, the, assemblies, that, control, movement, are, also, called, mechanisms, mechanisms, are, generally, classified, as, gears, and, gear, trains, which, includes, belt, drives, and, chain, drives, cam, and, follower, mechanisms, and, linkages, though, there, are, other, special, mechanisms, such, as, clamping, linkages, indexing, mechanisms, escapements, and, friction, devices, such, as, brakes, and, clutches, the, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, of, a, mechanism, or, its, mobility, depends, on, the, number, of, links, and, joints, and, the, types, of, joints, used, to, construct, the, mechanism, the, general, mobility, of, a, mechanism, is, the, difference, between, the, unconstrained, freedom, of, the, links, and, the, number, of, constraints, imposed, by, the, joints, it, is, described, by, the, chebychev, gr, bler, kutzbach, criterion, the, transmission, of, rotation, between, contacting, toothed, wheels, can, be, traced, back, to, the, antikythera, mechanism, of, greece, and, the, south, pointing, chariot, of, china, illustrations, by, the, renaissance, scientist, georgius, agricola, show, gear, trains, with, cylindrical, teeth, the, implementation, of, the, involute, tooth, yielded, a, standard, gear, design, that, provides, a, constant, speed, ratio, some, important, features, of, gears, and, gear, trains, are, a, cam, and, follower, is, formed, by, the, direct, contact, of, two, specially, shaped, links, the, driving, link, is, called, the, cam, also, see, cam, shaft, and, the, link, that, is, driven, through, the, direct, contact, of, their, surfaces, is, called, the, follower, the, shape, of, the, contacting, surfaces, of, the, cam, and, follower, determines, the, movement, of, the, mechanism, a, linkage, is, a, collection, of, links, connected, by, joints, generally, the, links, are, the, structural, elements, and, the, joints, allow, movement, perhaps, the, single, most, useful, example, is, the, planar, four, bar, linkage, however, there, are, many, more, special, linkages, a, planar, mechanism, is, a, mechanical, system, that, is, constrained, so, the, trajectories, of, points, in, all, the, bodies, of, the, system, lie, on, planes, parallel, to, a, ground, plane, the, rotational, axes, of, hinged, joints, that, connect, the, bodies, in, the, system, are, perpendicular, to, this, ground, plane, a, spherical, mechanism, is, a, mechanical, system, in, which, the, bodies, move, in, a, way, that, the, trajectories, of, points, in, the, system, lie, on, concentric, spheres, the, rotational, axes, of, hinged, joints, that, connect, the, bodies, in, the, system, pass, through, the, center, of, these, circle, a, spatial, mechanism, is, a, mechanical, system, that, has, at, least, one, body, that, moves, in, a, way, that, its, point, trajectories, are, general, space, curves, the, rotational, axes, of, hinged, joints, that, connect, the, bodies, in, the, system, form, lines, in, space, that, do, not, intersect, and, have, distinct, common, normals, a, flexure, mechanism, consists, of, a, series, of, rigid, bodies, connected, by, compliant, elements, also, known, as, flexure, joints, that, is, designed, to, produce, a, geometrically, well, defined, motion, upon, application, of, a, force, the, elementary, mechanical, components, of, a, machine, are, termed, machine, elements, these, elements, consist, of, three, basic, types, i, structural, components, such, as, frame, members, bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and, lubricants, ii, mechanisms, that, control, movement, in, various, ways, such, as, gear, trains, belt, or, chain, drives, linkages, cam, and, follower, systems, including, brakes, and, clutches, and, iii, control, components, such, as, buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators, and, computer, controllers, while, generally, not, considered, to, be, a, machine, element, the, shape, texture, and, color, of, covers, are, an, important, part, of, a, machine, that, provide, a, styling, and, operational, interface, between, the, mechanical, components, of, a, machine, and, its, users, a, number, of, machine, elements, provide, important, structural, functions, such, as, the, frame, bearings, splines, spring, and, seals, controllers, combine, sensors, logic, and, actuators, to, maintain, the, performance, of, components, of, a, machine, perhaps, the, best, known, is, the, flyball, governor, for, a, steam, engine, examples, of, these, devices, range, from, a, thermostat, that, as, temperature, rises, opens, a, valve, to, cooling, water, to, speed, controllers, such, as, the, cruise, control, system, in, an, automobile, the, programmable, logic, controller, replaced, relays, and, specialized, control, mechanisms, with, a, programmable, computer, servomotors, that, accurately, position, a, shaft, in, response, to, an, electrical, command, are, the, actuators, that, make, robotic, systems, possible, charles, babbage, designed, machines, to, tabulate, logarithms, and, other, functions, in, 1837, his, difference, engine, can, be, considered, an, advanced, mechanical, calculator, and, his, analytical, engine, a, forerunner, of, the, modern, computer, though, none, of, the, larger, designs, were, completed, in, babbage, s, lifetime, the, arithmometer, and, the, comptometer, are, mechanical, computers, that, are, precursors, to, modern, digital, computers, models, used, to, study, modern, computers, are, termed, state, machine, and, turing, machine, the, biological, molecule, myosin, reacts, to, atp, and, adp, to, alternately, engage, with, an, actin, filament, and, change, its, shape, in, a, way, that, exerts, a, force, and, then, disengage, to, reset, its, shape, or, conformation, this, acts, as, the, molecular, drive, that, causes, muscle, contraction, similarly, the, biological, molecule, kinesin, has, two, sections, that, alternately, engage, and, disengage, with, microtubules, causing, the, molecule, to, move, along, the, microtubule, and, transport, vesicles, within, the, cell, and, dynein, which, moves, cargo, inside, cells, towards, the, nucleus, and, produces, the, axonemal, beating, of, motile, cilia, and, flagella, in, effect, the, motile, cilium, is, a, nanomachine, composed, of, perhaps, over, 600, proteins, in, molecular, complexes, many, of, which, also, function, independently, as, nanomachines, flexible, linkers, allow, the, mobile, protein, domains, connected, by, them, to, recruit, their, binding, partners, and, induce, long, range, allostery, via, protein, domain, dynamics, other, biological, machines, are, responsible, for, energy, production, for, example, atp, synthase, which, harnesses, energy, from, proton, gradients, across, membranes, to, drive, a, turbine, like, motion, used, to, synthesise, atp, the, energy, currency, of, a, cell, still, other, machines, are, responsible, for, gene, expression, including, dna, polymerases, for, replicating, dna, rna, polymerases, for, producing, mrna, the, spliceosome, for, removing, introns, and, the, ribosome, for, synthesising, proteins, these, machines, and, their, nanoscale, dynamics, are, far, more, complex, than, any, molecular, machines, that, have, yet, been, artificially, constructed, these, molecules, are, increasingly, considered, to, be, nanomachines, researchers, have, used, dna, to, construct, nano, dimensioned, four, bar, linkages, mechanization, or, mechanisation, in, be, is, providing, human, operators, with, machinery, that, assists, them, with, the, muscular, requirements, of, work, or, displaces, muscular, work, in, some, fields, mechanization, includes, the, use, of, hand, tools, in, modern, usage, such, as, in, engineering, or, economics, mechanization, implies, machinery, more, complex, than, hand, tools, and, would, not, include, simple, devices, such, as, an, un, geared, horse, or, donkey, mill, devices, that, cause, speed, changes, or, changes, to, or, from, reciprocating, to, rotary, motion, using, means, such, as, gears, pulleys, or, sheaves, and, belts, shafts, cams, and, cranks, usually, are, considered, machines, after, electrification, when, most, small, machinery, was, no, longer, hand, powered, mechanization, was, synonymous, with, motorized, machines, automation, is, the, use, of, control, systems, and, information, technologies, to, reduce, the, need, for, human, work, in, the, production, of, goods, and, services, in, the, scope, of, industrialization, automation, is, a, step, beyond, mechanization, whereas, mechanization, provides, human, operators, with, machinery, to, assist, them, with, the, muscular, requirements, of, work, automation, greatly, decreases, the, need, for, human, sensory, and, mental, requirements, as, well, automation, plays, an, increasingly, important, role, in, the, world, economy, and, in, daily, experience, an, automaton, plural, automata, or, automatons, is, a, self, operating, machine, the, word, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, a, robot, more, specifically, an, autonomous, robot, a, toy, automaton, was, patented, in, 1863, usher, reports, that, hero, of, alexandria, s, treatise, on, mechanics, focussed, on, the, study, of, lifting, heavy, weights, today, mechanics, refers, to, the, mathematical, analysis, of, the, forces, and, movement, of, a, mechanical, system, and, consists, of, the, study, of, the, kinematics, and, dynamics, of, these, systems, the, dynamic, analysis, of, machines, begins, with, a, rigid, body, model, to, determine, reactions, at, the, bearings, at, which, point, the, elasticity, effects, are, included, the, rigid, body, dynamics, studies, the, movement, of, systems, of, interconnected, bodies, under, the, action, of, external, forces, the, assumption, that, the, bodies, are, rigid, which, means, that, they, do, not, deform, under, the, action, of, applied, forces, simplifies, the, analysis, by, reducing, the, parameters, that, describe, the, configuration, of, the, system, to, the, translation, and, rotation, of, reference, frames, attached, to, each, body, the, dynamics, of, a, rigid, body, system, is, defined, by, its, equations, of, motion, which, are, derived, using, either, newtons, laws, of, motion, or, lagrangian, mechanics, the, solution, of, these, equations, of, motion, defines, how, the, configuration, of, the, system, of, rigid, bodies, changes, as, a, function, of, time, the, formulation, and, solution, of, rigid, body, dynamics, is, an, important, tool, in, the, computer, simulation, of, mechanical, systems, the, dynamic, analysis, of, a, machine, requires, the, determination, of, the, movement, or, kinematics, of, its, component, parts, known, as, kinematic, analysis, the, assumption, that, the, system, is, an, assembly, of, rigid, components, allows, rotational, and, translational, movement, to, be, modeled, mathematically, as, euclidean, or, rigid, transformations, this, allows, the, position, velocity, and, acceleration, of, all, points, in, a, component, to, be, determined, from, these, properties, for, a, reference, point, and, the, angular, position, angular, velocity, and, angular, acceleration, of, the, component, machine, design, refers, to, the, procedures, and, techniques, used, to, address, the, three, phases, of, a, machine, s, lifecycle
