a, cement, is, a, binder, a, chemical, substance, used, for, construction, that, sets, hardens, and, adheres, to, other, materials, to, bind, them, together, cement, is, seldom, used, on, its, own, but, rather, to, bind, sand, and, gravel, aggregate, together, cement, mixed, with, fine, aggregate, produces, mortar, for, masonry, or, with, sand, and, gravel, produces, concrete, concrete, is, the, most, widely, used, material, in, existence, and, is, behind, only, water, as, the, planet, s, most, consumed, resource, cements, used, in, construction, are, usually, inorganic, often, lime, or, calcium, silicate, based, which, can, be, characterized, as, hydraulic, or, the, less, common, non, hydraulic, depending, on, the, ability, of, the, cement, to, set, in, the, presence, of, water, see, hydraulic, and, non, hydraulic, lime, plaster, hydraulic, cements, e, g, portland, cement, set, and, become, adhesive, through, a, chemical, reaction, between, the, dry, ingredients, and, water, the, chemical, reaction, results, in, mineral, hydrates, that, are, not, very, water, soluble, this, allows, setting, in, wet, conditions, or, under, water, and, further, protects, the, hardened, material, from, chemical, attack, the, chemical, process, for, hydraulic, cement, was, found, by, ancient, romans, who, used, volcanic, ash, pozzolana, with, added, lime, calcium, oxide, non, hydraulic, cement, less, common, does, not, set, in, wet, conditions, or, under, water, rather, it, sets, as, it, dries, and, reacts, with, carbon, dioxide, in, the, air, it, is, resistant, to, attack, by, chemicals, after, setting, the, word, cement, can, be, traced, back, to, the, ancient, roman, term, opus, caementicium, used, to, describe, masonry, resembling, modern, concrete, that, was, made, from, crushed, rock, with, burnt, lime, as, binder, the, volcanic, ash, and, pulverized, brick, supplements, that, were, added, to, the, burnt, lime, to, obtain, a, hydraulic, binder, were, later, referred, to, as, cementum, cimentum, c, ment, and, cement, in, modern, times, organic, polymers, are, sometimes, used, as, cements, in, concrete, world, production, of, cement, is, about, 4, 4, billion, tonnes, per, year, 2021, estimation, of, which, about, half, is, made, in, china, followed, by, india, and, vietnam, the, cement, production, process, is, responsible, for, nearly, 8, 2018, of, global, co, 2, emissions, which, includes, heating, raw, materials, in, a, cement, kiln, by, fuel, combustion, and, resulting, release, of, co, 2, stored, in, the, calcium, carbonate, calcination, process, its, hydrated, products, such, as, concrete, gradually, reabsorb, substantial, amounts, of, atmospheric, co, 2, carbonation, process, compensating, near, 30, of, initial, co, 2, emissions, as, estimations, suggest, cement, materials, can, be, classified, into, two, distinct, categories, hydraulic, cements, and, non, hydraulic, cements, according, to, their, respective, setting, and, hardening, mechanisms, hydraulic, cement, setting, and, hardening, involves, hydration, reactions, and, therefore, requires, water, while, non, hydraulic, cements, only, react, with, a, gas, and, can, directly, set, under, air, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, cement, is, hydraulic, cement, which, hardens, by, hydration, of, the, clinker, minerals, when, water, is, added, hydraulic, cements, such, as, portland, cement, are, made, of, a, mixture, of, silicates, and, oxides, the, four, main, mineral, phases, of, the, clinker, abbreviated, in, the, cement, chemist, notation, being, the, silicates, are, responsible, for, the, cement, s, mechanical, properties, the, tricalcium, aluminate, and, brownmillerite, are, essential, for, the, formation, of, the, liquid, phase, during, the, sintering, firing, process, of, clinker, at, high, temperature, in, the, kiln, the, chemistry, of, these, reactions, is, not, completely, clear, and, is, still, the, object, of, research, first, the, limestone, calcium, carbonate, is, burned, to, remove, its, carbon, producing, lime, calcium, oxide, in, what, is, known, as, a, calcination, reaction, this, single, chemical, reaction, is, a, major, emitter, of, global, carbon, dioxide, emissions, the, lime, reacts, with, silicon, dioxide, to, produce, dicalcium, silicate, and, tricalcium, silicate, the, lime, also, reacts, with, aluminium, oxide, to, form, tricalcium, aluminate, in, the, last, step, calcium, oxide, aluminium, oxide, and, ferric, oxide, react, together, to, form, brownmillerite, a, less, common, form, of, cement, is, non, hydraulic, cement, such, as, slaked, lime, calcium, oxide, mixed, with, water, which, hardens, by, carbonation, in, contact, with, carbon, dioxide, which, is, present, in, the, air, 412, vol, ppm, 0, 04, vol, first, calcium, oxide, lime, is, produced, from, calcium, carbonate, limestone, or, chalk, by, calcination, at, temperatures, above, 825, c, 1, 517, f, for, about, 10, hours, at, atmospheric, pressure, the, calcium, oxide, is, then, spent, slaked, by, mixing, it, with, water, to, make, slaked, lime, calcium, hydroxide, once, the, excess, water, is, completely, evaporated, this, process, is, technically, called, setting, the, carbonation, starts, this, reaction, is, slow, because, the, partial, pressure, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, air, is, low, 0, 4, millibar, the, carbonation, reaction, requires, that, the, dry, cement, be, exposed, to, air, so, the, slaked, lime, is, a, non, hydraulic, cement, and, cannot, be, used, under, water, this, process, is, called, the, lime, cycle, perhaps, the, earliest, known, occurrence, of, cement, is, from, twelve, million, years, ago, a, deposit, of, cement, was, formed, after, an, occurrence, of, oil, shale, located, adjacent, to, a, bed, of, limestone, burned, by, natural, causes, these, ancient, deposits, were, investigated, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, cement, chemically, speaking, is, a, product, that, includes, lime, as, the, primary, binding, ingredient, but, is, far, from, the, first, material, used, for, cementation, the, babylonians, and, assyrians, used, bitumen, asphalt, or, pitch, to, bind, together, burnt, brick, or, alabaster, slabs, in, ancient, egypt, stone, blocks, were, cemented, together, with, a, mortar, made, of, sand, and, roughly, burnt, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, which, is, plaster, of, paris, which, often, contained, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, lime, calcium, oxide, was, used, on, crete, and, by, the, ancient, greeks, there, is, evidence, that, the, minoans, of, crete, used, crushed, potsherds, as, an, artificial, pozzolan, for, hydraulic, cement, nobody, knows, who, first, discovered, that, a, combination, of, hydrated, non, hydraulic, lime, and, a, pozzolan, produces, a, hydraulic, mixture, see, also, pozzolanic, reaction, but, such, concrete, was, used, by, the, greeks, specifically, the, ancient, macedonians, and, three, centuries, later, on, a, large, scale, by, roman, engineers, there, is, a, kind, of, powder, which, from, natural, causes, produces, astonishing, results, it, is, found, in, the, neighborhood, of, baiae, and, in, the, country, belonging, to, the, towns, round, about, mount, vesuvius, this, substance, when, mixed, with, lime, and, rubble, not, only, lends, strength, to, buildings, of, other, kinds, but, even, when, piers, of, it, are, constructed, in, the, sea, they, set, hard, underwater, the, greeks, used, volcanic, tuff, from, the, island, of, thera, as, their, pozzolan, and, the, romans, used, crushed, volcanic, ash, activated, aluminium, silicates, with, lime, this, mixture, could, set, under, water, increasing, its, resistance, to, corrosion, like, rust, the, material, was, called, pozzolana, from, the, town, of, pozzuoli, west, of, naples, where, volcanic, ash, was, extracted, in, the, absence, of, pozzolanic, ash, the, romans, used, powdered, brick, or, pottery, as, a, substitute, and, they, may, have, used, crushed, tiles, for, this, purpose, before, discovering, natural, sources, near, rome, the, huge, dome, of, the, pantheon, in, rome, and, the, massive, baths, of, caracalla, are, examples, of, ancient, structures, made, from, these, concretes, many, of, which, still, stand, the, vast, system, of, roman, aqueducts, also, made, extensive, use, of, hydraulic, cement, roman, concrete, was, rarely, used, on, the, outside, of, buildings, the, normal, technique, was, to, use, brick, facing, material, as, the, formwork, for, an, infill, of, mortar, mixed, with, an, aggregate, of, broken, pieces, of, stone, brick, potsherds, recycled, chunks, of, concrete, or, other, building, rubble, lightweight, concrete, was, designed, and, used, for, the, construction, of, structural, elements, by, the, pre, columbian, builders, who, lived, in, a, very, advanced, civilisation, in, el, tajin, near, mexico, city, in, mexico, a, detailed, study, of, the, composition, of, the, aggregate, and, binder, show, that, the, aggregate, was, pumice, and, the, binder, was, a, pozzolanic, cement, made, with, volcanic, ash, and, lime, any, preservation, of, this, knowledge, in, literature, from, the, middle, ages, is, unknown, but, medieval, masons, and, some, military, engineers, actively, used, hydraulic, cement, in, structures, such, as, canals, fortresses, harbors, and, shipbuilding, facilities, a, mixture, of, lime, mortar, and, aggregate, with, brick, or, stone, facing, material, was, used, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, as, well, as, in, the, west, into, the, gothic, period, the, german, rhineland, continued, to, use, hydraulic, mortar, throughout, the, middle, ages, having, local, pozzolana, deposits, called, trass, tabby, is, a, building, material, made, from, oyster, shell, lime, sand, and, whole, oyster, shells, to, form, a, concrete, the, spanish, introduced, it, to, the, americas, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, technical, knowledge, for, making, hydraulic, cement, was, formalized, by, french, and, british, engineers, in, the, 18th, century, john, smeaton, made, an, important, contribution, to, the, development, of, cements, while, planning, the, construction, of, the, third, eddystone, lighthouse, 1755, 59, in, the, english, channel, now, known, as, smeaton, s, tower, he, needed, a, hydraulic, mortar, that, would, set, and, develop, some, strength, in, the, twelve, hour, period, between, successive, high, tides, he, performed, experiments, with, combinations, of, different, limestones, and, additives, including, trass, and, pozzolanas, and, did, exhaustive, market, research, on, the, available, hydraulic, limes, visiting, their, production, sites, and, noted, that, the, hydraulicity, of, the, lime, was, directly, related, to, the, clay, content, of, the, limestone, used, to, make, it, smeaton, was, a, civil, engineer, by, profession, and, took, the, idea, no, further, in, the, south, atlantic, seaboard, of, the, united, states, tabby, relying, on, the, oyster, shell, middens, of, earlier, native, american, populations, was, used, in, house, construction, from, the, 1730s, to, the, 1860s, in, britain, particularly, good, quality, building, stone, became, ever, more, expensive, during, a, period, of, rapid, growth, and, it, became, a, common, practice, to, construct, prestige, buildings, from, the, new, industrial, bricks, and, to, finish, them, with, a, stucco, to, imitate, stone, hydraulic, limes, were, favored, for, this, but, the, need, for, a, fast, set, time, encouraged, the, development, of, new, cements, most, famous, was, parker, s, roman, cement, this, was, developed, by, james, parker, in, the, 1780s, and, finally, patented, in, 1796, it, was, in, fact, nothing, like, material, used, by, the, romans, but, was, a, natural, cement, made, by, burning, septaria, nodules, that, are, found, in, certain, clay, deposits, and, that, contain, both, clay, minerals, and, calcium, carbonate, the, burnt, nodules, were, ground, to, a, fine, powder, this, product, made, into, a, mortar, with, sand, set, in, 5, 15, minutes, the, success, of, roman, cement, led, other, manufacturers, to, develop, rival, products, by, burning, artificial, hydraulic, lime, cements, of, clay, and, chalk, roman, cement, quickly, became, popular, but, was, largely, replaced, by, portland, cement, in, the, 1850s, apparently, unaware, of, smeaton, s, work, the, same, principle, was, identified, by, frenchman, louis, vicat, in, the, first, decade, of, the, nineteenth, century, vicat, went, on, to, devise, a, method, of, combining, chalk, and, clay, into, an, intimate, mixture, and, burning, this, produced, an, artificial, cement, in, 1817, considered, the, principal, forerunner, of, portland, cement, and, edgar, dobbs, of, southwark, patented, a, cement, of, this, kind, in, 1811, in, russia, egor, cheliev, created, a, new, binder, by, mixing, lime, and, clay, his, results, were, published, in, 1822, in, his, book, a, treatise, on, the, art, to, prepare, a, good, mortar, published, in, st, petersburg, a, few, years, later, in, 1825, he, published, another, book, which, described, various, methods, of, making, cement, and, concrete, and, the, benefits, of, cement, in, the, construction, of, buildings, and, embankments, portland, cement, the, most, common, type, of, cement, in, general, use, around, the, world, as, a, basic, ingredient, of, concrete, mortar, stucco, and, non, speciality, grout, was, developed, in, england, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, usually, originates, from, limestone, james, frost, produced, what, he, called, british, cement, in, a, similar, manner, around, the, same, time, but, did, not, obtain, a, patent, until, 1822, in, 1824, joseph, aspdin, patented, a, similar, material, which, he, called, portland, cement, because, the, render, made, from, it, was, in, color, similar, to, the, prestigious, portland, stone, quarried, on, the, isle, of, portland, dorset, england, however, aspdins, cement, was, nothing, like, modern, portland, cement, but, was, a, first, step, in, its, development, called, a, proto, portland, cement, joseph, aspdins, son, william, aspdin, had, left, his, father, s, company, and, in, his, cement, manufacturing, apparently, accidentally, produced, calcium, silicates, in, the, 1840s, a, middle, step, in, the, development, of, portland, cement, william, aspdin, s, innovation, was, counterintuitive, for, manufacturers, of, artificial, cements, because, they, required, more, lime, in, the, mix, a, problem, for, his, father, a, much, higher, kiln, temperature, and, therefore, more, fuel, and, the, resulting, clinker, was, very, hard, and, rapidly, wore, down, the, millstones, which, were, the, only, available, grinding, technology, of, the, time, manufacturing, costs, were, therefore, considerably, higher, but, the, product, set, reasonably, slowly, and, developed, strength, quickly, thus, opening, up, a, market, for, use, in, concrete, the, use, of, concrete, in, construction, grew, rapidly, from, 1850, onward, and, was, soon, the, dominant, use, for, cements, thus, portland, cement, began, its, predominant, role, isaac, charles, johnson, further, refined, the, production, of, meso, portland, cement, middle, stage, of, development, and, claimed, he, was, the, real, father, of, portland, cement, setting, time, and, early, strength, are, important, characteristics, of, cements, hydraulic, limes, natural, cements, and, artificial, cements, all, rely, on, their, belite, 2, cao, sio, 2, abbreviated, as, c, 2, s, content, for, strength, development, belite, develops, strength, slowly, because, they, were, burned, at, temperatures, below, 1, 250, c, 2, 280, f, they, contained, no, alite, 3, cao, sio, 2, abbreviated, as, c, 3, s, which, is, responsible, for, early, strength, in, modern, cements, the, first, cement, to, consistently, contain, alite, was, made, by, william, aspdin, in, the, early, 1840s, this, was, what, we, call, today, modern, portland, cement, because, of, the, air, of, mystery, with, which, william, aspdin, surrounded, his, product, others, e, g, vicat, and, johnson, have, claimed, precedence, in, this, invention, but, recent, analysis, of, both, his, concrete, and, raw, cement, have, shown, that, william, aspdin, s, product, made, at, northfleet, kent, was, a, true, alite, based, cement, however, aspdin, s, methods, were, rule, of, thumb, vicat, is, responsible, for, establishing, the, chemical, basis, of, these, cements, and, johnson, established, the, importance, of, sintering, the, mix, in, the, kiln, in, the, us, the, first, large, scale, use, of, cement, was, rosendale, cement, a, natural, cement, mined, from, a, massive, deposit, of, dolomite, discovered, in, the, early, 19th, century, near, rosendale, new, york, rosendale, cement, was, extremely, popular, for, the, foundation, of, buildings, e, g, statue, of, liberty, capitol, building, brooklyn, bridge, and, lining, water, pipes, sorel, cement, or, magnesia, based, cement, was, patented, in, 1867, by, the, frenchman, stanislas, sorel, it, was, stronger, than, portland, cement, but, its, poor, water, resistance, leaching, and, corrosive, properties, pitting, corrosion, due, to, the, presence, of, leachable, chloride, anions, and, the, low, ph, 8, 5, 9, 5, of, its, pore, water, limited, its, use, as, reinforced, concrete, for, building, construction, the, next, development, in, the, manufacture, of, portland, cement, was, the, introduction, of, the, rotary, kiln, it, produced, a, clinker, mixture, that, was, both, stronger, because, more, alite, c, 3, s, is, formed, at, the, higher, temperature, it, achieved, 1450, c, and, more, homogeneous, because, raw, material, is, constantly, fed, into, a, rotary, kiln, it, allowed, a, continuous, manufacturing, process, to, replace, lower, capacity, batch, production, processes, calcium, aluminate, cements, were, patented, in, 1908, in, france, by, jules, bied, for, better, resistance, to, sulfates, also, in, 1908, thomas, edison, experimented, with, pre, cast, concrete, in, houses, in, union, n, j, in, the, us, after, world, war, one, the, long, curing, time, of, at, least, a, month, for, rosendale, cement, made, it, unpopular, for, constructing, highways, and, bridges, and, many, states, and, construction, firms, turned, to, portland, cement, because, of, the, switch, to, portland, cement, by, the, end, of, the, 1920s, only, one, of, the, 15, rosendale, cement, companies, had, survived, but, in, the, early, 1930s, builders, discovered, that, while, portland, cement, set, faster, it, was, not, as, durable, especially, for, highways, to, the, point, that, some, states, stopped, building, highways, and, roads, with, cement, bertrain, h, wait, an, engineer, whose, company, had, helped, construct, the, new, york, city, s, catskill, aqueduct, was, impressed, with, the, durability, of, rosendale, cement, and, came, up, with, a, blend, of, both, rosendale, and, portland, cements, that, had, the, good, attributes, of, both, it, was, highly, durable, and, had, a, much, faster, setting, time, wait, convinced, the, new, york, commissioner, of, highways, to, construct, an, experimental, section, of, highway, near, new, paltz, new, york, using, one, sack, of, rosendale, to, six, sacks, of, portland, cement, it, was, a, success, and, for, decades, the, rosendale, portland, cement, blend, was, used, in, concrete, highway, and, concrete, bridge, construction, cementitious, materials, have, been, used, as, a, nuclear, waste, immobilizing, matrix, for, more, than, a, half, century, technologies, of, waste, cementation, have, been, developed, and, deployed, at, industrial, scale, in, many, countries, cementitious, wasteforms, require, a, careful, selection, and, design, process, adapted, to, each, specific, type, of, waste, to, satisfy, the, strict, waste, acceptance, criteria, for, long, term, storage, and, disposal, modern, development, of, hydraulic, cement, began, with, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, around, 1800, driven, by, three, main, needs, modern, cements, are, often, portland, cement, or, portland, cement, blends, but, other, cement, blends, are, used, in, some, industrial, settings, portland, cement, a, form, of, hydraulic, cement, is, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, cement, in, general, use, around, the, world, this, cement, is, made, by, heating, limestone, calcium, carbonate, with, other, materials, such, as, clay, to, 1, 450, c, 2, 640, f, in, a, kiln, in, a, process, known, as, calcination, that, liberates, a, molecule, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, calcium, carbonate, to, form, calcium, oxide, or, quicklime, which, then, chemically, combines, with, the, other, materials, in, the, mix, to, form, calcium, silicates, and, other, cementitious, compounds, the, resulting, hard, substance, called, clinker, is, then, ground, with, a, small, amount, of, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, into, a, powder, to, make, ordinary, portland, cement, the, most, commonly, used, type, of, cement, often, referred, to, as, opc, portland, cement, is, a, basic, ingredient, of, concrete, mortar, and, most, non, specialty, grout, the, most, common, use, for, portland, cement, is, to, make, concrete, portland, cement, may, be, grey, or, white, portland, cement, blends, are, often, available, as, inter, ground, mixtures, from, cement, producers, but, similar, formulations, are, often, also, mixed, from, the, ground, components, at, the, concrete, mixing, plant, portland, blast, furnace, slag, cement, or, blast, furnace, cement, astm, c595, and, en, 197, 1, nomenclature, respectively, contains, up, to, 95, ground, granulated, blast, furnace, slag, with, the, rest, portland, clinker, and, a, little, gypsum, all, compositions, produce, high, ultimate, strength, but, as, slag, content, is, increased, early, strength, is, reduced, while, sulfate, resistance, increases, and, heat, evolution, diminishes, used, as, an, economic, alternative, to, portland, sulfate, resisting, and, low, heat, cements, portland, fly, ash, cement, contains, up, to, 40, fly, ash, under, astm, standards, astm, c595, or, 35, under, en, standards, en, 197, 1, the, fly, ash, is, pozzolanic, so, that, ultimate, strength, is, maintained, because, fly, ash, addition, allows, a, lower, concrete, water, content, early, strength, can, also, be, maintained, where, good, quality, cheap, fly, ash, is, available, this, can, be, an, economic, alternative, to, ordinary, portland, cement, portland, pozzolan, cement, includes, fly, ash, cement, since, fly, ash, is, a, pozzolan, but, also, includes, cements, made, from, other, natural, or, artificial, pozzolans, in, countries, where, volcanic, ashes, are, available, e, g, italy, chile, mexico, the, philippines, these, cements, are, often, the, most, common, form, in, use, the, maximum, replacement, ratios, are, generally, defined, as, for, portland, fly, ash, cement, portland, silica, fume, cement, addition, of, silica, fume, can, yield, exceptionally, high, strengths, and, cements, containing, 5, 20, silica, fume, are, occasionally, produced, with, 10, being, the, maximum, allowed, addition, under, en, 197, 1, however, silica, fume, is, more, usually, added, to, portland, cement, at, the, concrete, mixer, masonry, cements, are, used, for, preparing, bricklaying, mortars, and, stuccos, and, must, not, be, used, in, concrete, they, are, usually, complex, proprietary, formulations, containing, portland, clinker, and, a, number, of, other, ingredients, that, may, include, limestone, hydrated, lime, air, entrainers, retarders, waterproofers, and, coloring, agents, they, are, formulated, to, yield, workable, mortars, that, allow, rapid, and, consistent, masonry, work, subtle, variations, of, masonry, cement, in, north, america, are, plastic, cements, and, stucco, cements, these, are, designed, to, produce, a, controlled, bond, with, masonry, blocks, expansive, cements, contain, in, addition, to, portland, clinker, expansive, clinkers, usually, sulfoaluminate, clinkers, and, are, designed, to, offset, the, effects, of, drying, shrinkage, normally, encountered, in, hydraulic, cements, this, cement, can, make, concrete, for, floor, slabs, up, to, 60, m, square, without, contraction, joints, white, blended, cements, may, be, made, using, white, clinker, containing, little, or, no, iron, and, white, supplementary, materials, such, as, high, purity, metakaolin, colored, cements, serve, decorative, purposes, some, standards, allow, the, addition, of, pigments, to, produce, colored, portland, cement, other, standards, e, g, astm, do, not, allow, pigments, in, portland, cement, and, colored, cements, are, sold, as, blended, hydraulic, cements, very, finely, ground, cements, are, cement, mixed, with, sand, or, with, slag, or, other, pozzolan, type, minerals, that, are, extremely, finely, ground, together, such, cements, can, have, the, same, physical, characteristics, as, normal, cement, but, with, 50, less, cement, particularly, because, there, is, more, surface, area, for, the, chemical, reaction, even, with, intensive, grinding, they, can, use, up, to, 50, less, energy, and, thus, less, carbon, emissions, to, fabricate, than, ordinary, portland, cements, pozzolan, lime, cements, are, mixtures, of, ground, pozzolan, and, lime, these, are, the, cements, the, romans, used, and, are, present, in, surviving, roman, structures, like, the, pantheon, in, rome, they, develop, strength, slowly, but, their, ultimate, strength, can, be, very, high, the, hydration, products, that, produce, strength, are, essentially, the, same, as, those, in, portland, cement, slag, lime, cements, ground, granulated, blast, furnace, slag, are, not, hydraulic, on, their, own,

china, with, 1, 800, india, with, 220, and, the, united, states, with, 63, 5, million, tonnes, for, a, total, of, over, half, the, world, total, by, the, world, s, three, most, populated, states, for, the, world, capacity, to, produce, cement, in, 2010, the, situation, was, similar, with, the, top, three, states, china, india, and, the, us, accounting, for, just, under, half, the, world, total, capacity, over, 2011, and, 2012, global, consumption, continued, to, climb, rising, to, 3585, mt, in, 2011, and, 3736, mt, in, 2012, while, annual, growth, rates, eased, to, 8, 3, and, 4, 2, respectively, china, representing, an, increasing, share, of, world, cement, consumption, remains, the, main, engine, of, global, growth, by, 2012, chinese, demand, was, recorded, at, 2160, mt, representing, 58, of, world, consumption, annual, growth, rates, which, reached, 16, in, 2010, appear, to, have, softened, slowing, to, 5, 6, over, 2011, and, 2012, as, china, s, economy, targets, a, more, sustainable, growth, rate, outside, of, china, worldwide, consumption, climbed, by, 4, 4, to, 1462, mt, in, 2010, 5, to, 1535, mt, in, 2011, and, finally, 2, 7, to, 1576, mt, in, 2012, iran, is, now, the, 3rd, largest, cement, producer, in, the, world, and, has, increased, its, output, by, over, 10, from, 2008, to, 2011, because, of, climbing, energy, costs, in, pakistan, and, other, major, cement, producing, countries, iran, is, in, a, unique, position, as, a, trading, partner, utilizing, its, own, surplus, petroleum, to, power, clinker, plants, now, a, top, producer, in, the, middle, east, iran, is, further, increasing, its, dominant, position, in, local, markets, and, abroad, the, performance, in, north, america, and, europe, over, the, 2010, 12, period, contrasted, strikingly, with, that, of, china, as, the, global, financial, crisis, evolved, into, a, sovereign, debt, crisis, for, many, economies, in, this, region, and, recession, cement, consumption, levels, for, this,

economies, in, asia, africa, and, latin, america, and, representing, some, 1020, mt, cement, demand, in, 2010, was, positive, and, more, than, offset, the, declines, in, north, america, and, europe, annual, consumption, growth, was, recorded, at, 7, 4, in, 2010, moderating, to, 5, 1, and, 4, 3, in, 2011, and, 2012, respectively, as, at, year, end, 2012, the, global, cement, industry, consisted, of, 5673, cement, production, facilities, including, both, integrated, and, grinding, of, which, 3900, were, located, in, china, and, 1773, in, the, rest, of, the, world, total, cement, capacity, worldwide, was, recorded, at, 5245, mt, in, 2012, with, 2950, mt, located, in, china, and, 2295, mt, in, the, rest, of, the, world, for, the, past, 18, years, china, consistently, has, produced, more, cement, than, any, other, country, in, the, world, however, china, s, cement, export, peaked, in, 1994, with, 11, million, tonnes, shipped, out, and, has, been, in, steady, decline, ever, since, only, 5, 18, million, tonnes, were, exported, out, of, china, in, 2002, offered, at, 34, a, ton, chinese, cement, is, pricing, itself, out, of, the, market, as, thailand, is, asking, as, little, as, 20, for, the, same, quality, in, 2006, it, was, estimated, that, china, manufactured, 1, 235, billion, tonnes, of, cement, which, was, 44, of, the, world, total, cement, production, demand, for, cement, in, china, is, expected, to, advance, 5, 4, annually, and, exceed, 1, billion, tonnes, in, 2008, driven, by, slowing, but, healthy, growth, in, construction, expenditures, cement, consumed, in, china, will, amount, to, 44, of, global, demand, and, china, will, remain, the, world, s, largest, national, consumer, of, cement, by, a, large, margin, in, 2010, 3, 3, billion, tonnes, of, cement, was, consumed, globally, of, this, china, accounted, for, 1, 8, billion, tonnes, cement, manufacture, causes, environmental, impacts, at, all, stages, of, the, process, these, include, emissions, of, airborne, pollution, in, the, form, of, dust, gases, noise, and, vibration, when, operating, machinery, and, during, blasting, in, quarries, and, damage, to, countryside, from, quarrying, equipment, to, reduce, dust, emissions, during, quarrying, and, manufacture, of, cement, is, widely, used, and, equipment, to, trap, and, separate, exhaust, gases, are, coming, into, increased, use, environmental, protection, also, includes, the, re, integration, of, quarries, into, the, countryside, after, they, have, been, closed, down, by, returning, them, to, nature, or, re, cultivating, them, carbon, concentration, in, cement, spans, from, 5, in, cement, structures, to, 8, in, the, case, of, roads, in, cement, cement, manufacturing, releases, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, both, directly, when, calcium, carbonate, is, heated, producing, lime, and, carbon, dioxide, and, also, indirectly, through, the, use, of, energy, if, its, production, involves, the, emission, of, co, 2, the, cement, industry, produces, about, 10, of, global, human, made, co, 2, emissions, of, which, 60, is, from, the, chemical, process, and, 40, from, burning, fuel, a, chatham, house, study, from, 2018, estimates, that, the, 4, billion, tonnes, of, cement, produced, annually, account, for, 8, of, worldwide, co, 2, emissions, nearly, 900, kg, of, co, 2, are, emitted, for, every, 1000, kg, of, portland, cement, produced, in, the, european, union, the, specific, energy, consumption, for, the, production, of, cement, clinker, has, been, reduced, by, approximately, 30, since, the, 1970s, this, reduction, in, primary, energy, requirements, is, equivalent, to, approximately, 11, million, tonnes, of, coal, per, year, with, corresponding, benefits, in, reduction, of, co, 2, emissions, this, accounts, for, approximately, 5, of, anthropogenic, co, 2, the, majority, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, in, the, manufacture, of, portland, cement, approximately, 60, are, produced, from, the, chemical, decomposition, of, limestone, to, lime, an, ingredient, in, portland, cement, clinker, these, emissions, may, be, reduced, by, lowering, the, clinker, content, of, cement, they, can, also, be, reduced, by, alternative, fabrication, methods, such, as, the, intergrinding, cement, with, sand, or, with, slag, or, other, pozzolan, type, minerals, to, a, very, fine, powder, to, reduce, the, transport, of, heavier, raw, materials, and, to, minimize, the, associated, costs, it, is, more, economical, to, build, cement, plants, closer, to, the, limestone, quarries, rather, than, to, the, consumer, centers, as, of, 2019, carbon, capture, and, storage, is, about, to, be, trialed, but, its, financial, viability, is, uncertain, hydrated, products, of, portland, cement, such, as, concrete, and, mortars, slowly, reabsorb, atmospheric, co2, gas, which, has, been, released, during, calcination, in, a, kiln, this, natural, process, reversed, to, calcination, is, called, carbonation, as, it, depends, on, co2, diffusion, into, the, bulk, of, concrete, its, rate, depends, on, many, parameters, such, as, environmental, conditions, and, surface, area, exposed, to, the, atmosphere, carbonation, is, particularly, significant, at, the, latter, stages, of, the, concrete, life, after, demolition, and, crushing, of, the, debris, it, was, estimated, that, during, the, whole, life, cycle, of, cement, products, it, can, be, reabsorbed, nearly, 30, of, atmospheric, co2, generated, by, cement, production, carbonation, process, is, considered, as, a, mechanism, of, concrete, degradation, it, reduces, ph, of, concrete, that, promotes, reinforcement, steel, corrosion, however, as, the, product, of, ca, oh, 2, carbonation, caco3, occupies, a, greater, volume, porosity, of, concrete, reduces, this, increases, strength, and, hardness, of, concrete, there, are, proposals, to, reduce, carbon, footprint, of, hydraulic, cement, by, adopting, non, hydraulic, cement, lime, mortar, for, certain, applications, it, reabsorbs, some, of, the, co, 2, during, hardening, and, has, a, lower, energy, requirement, in, production, than, portland, cement, a, few, other, attempts, to, increase, absorption, of, carbon, dioxide, include, cements, based, on, magnesium, sorel, cement, in, some, circumstances, mainly, depending, on, the, origin, and, the, composition, of, the, raw, materials, used, the, high, temperature, calcination, process, of, limestone, and, clay, minerals, can, release, in, the, atmosphere, gases, and, dust, rich, in, volatile, heavy, metals, e, g, thallium, cadmium, and, mercury, are, the, most, toxic, heavy, metals, tl, cd, hg, and, also, selenium, are, often, found, as, trace, elements, in, common, metal, sulfides, pyrite, fes, 2, zinc, blende, zns, galena, pbs, present, as, secondary, minerals, in, most, of, the, raw, materials, environmental, regulations, exist, in, many, countries, to, limit, these, emissions, as, of, 2011, in, the, united, states, cement, kilns, are, legally, allowed, to, pump, more, toxins, into, the, air, than, are, hazardous, waste, incinerators, the, presence, of, heavy, metals, in, the, clinker, arises, both, from, the, natural, raw, materials, and, from, the, use, of, recycled, by, products, or, alternative, fuels, the, high, ph, prevailing, in, the, cement, porewater, 12, 5, ph, 13, 5, limits, the, mobility, of, many, heavy, metals, by, decreasing, their, solubility, and, increasing, their, sorption, onto, the, cement, mineral, phases, nickel, zinc, and, lead, are, commonly, found, in, cement, in, non, negligible, concentrations, chromium, may, also, directly, arise, as, natural, impurity, from, the, raw, materials, or, as, secondary, contamination, from, the, abrasion, of, hard, chromium, steel, alloys, used, in, the, ball, mills, when, the, clinker, is, ground, as, chromate, cro, 4, 2, is, toxic, and, may, cause, severe, skin, allergies, at, trace, concentration, it, is, sometimes, reduced, into, trivalent, cr, iii, by, addition, of, ferrous, sulfate, feso, 4, a, cement, plant, consumes, 3, to, 6, gj, of, fuel, per, tonne, of, clinker, produced, depending, on, the, raw, materials, and, the, process, used, most, cement, kilns, today, use, coal, and, petroleum, coke, as, primary, fuels, and, to, a, lesser, extent, natural, gas, and, fuel, oil, selected, waste, and, by, products, with, recoverable, calorific, value, can, be, used, as, fuels, in, a, cement, kiln, referred, to, as, co, processing, replacing, a, portion, of, conventional, fossil, fuels, like, coal, if, they, meet, strict, specifications, selected, waste, and, by, products, containing, useful, minerals, such, as, calcium, silica, alumina, and, iron, can, be, used, as, raw, materials, in, the, kiln, replacing, raw, materials, such, as, clay, shale, and, limestone, because, some, materials, have, both, useful, mineral, content, and, recoverable, calorific, value, the, distinction, between, alternative, fuels, and, raw, materials, is, not, always, clear, for, example, sewage, sludge, has, a, low, but, significant, calorific, value, and, burns, to, give, ash, containing, minerals, useful, in, the, clinker, matrix, scrap, automobile, and, truck, tires, are, useful, in, cement, manufacturing, as, they, have, high, calorific, value, and, the, iron, embedded, in, tires, is, useful, as, a, feed, stock, p, 27, clinker, is, manufactured, by, heating, raw, materials, inside, the, main, burner, of, a, kiln, to, a, temperature, of, 1, 450, c, the, flame, reaches, temperatures, of, 1, 800, c, the, material, remains, at, 1, 200, c, for, 12, 15, seconds, at, 1, 800, c, and, or, for, 5, 8, seconds, also, referred, to, as, residence, time, these, characteristics, of, a, clinker, kiln, offer, numerous, benefits, and, they, ensure, a, complete, destruction, of, organic, compounds, a, total, neutralization, of, acid, gases, sulphur, oxides, and, hydrogen, chloride, furthermore, heavy, metal, traces, are, embedded, in, the, clinker, structure, and, no, by, products, such, as, ash, or, residues, are, produced, the, eu, cement, industry, already, uses, more, than, 40, fuels, derived, from, waste, and, biomass, in, supplying, the, thermal, energy, to, the, grey, clinker, making, process, although, the, choice, for, this, so, called, alternative, fuels, af, is, typically, cost, driven, other, factors, are, becoming, more, important, use, of, alternative, fuels, provides, benefits, for, both, society, and, the, company, co, 2, emissions, are, lower, than, with, fossil, fuels, waste, can, be, co, processed, in, an, efficient, and, sustainable, manner, and, the, demand, for, certain, virgin, materials, can, be, reduced, yet, there, are, large, differences, in, the, share, of, alternative, fuels, used, between, the, european, union, eu, member, states, the, societal, benefits, could, be, improved, if, more, member, states, increase, their, alternative, fuels, share, the, ecofys, study, assessed, the, barriers, and, opportunities, for, further, uptake, of, alternative, fuels, in, 14, eu, member, states, the, ecofys, study, found, that, local, factors, constrain, the, market, potential, to, a, much, larger, extent, than, the, technical, and, economic, feasibility, of, the, cement, industry, itself, growing, environmental, concerns, and, the, increasing, cost, of, fossil, fuels, have, resulted, in, many, countries, in, a, sharp, reduction, of, the, resources, needed, to, produce, cement, as, well, as, effluents, dust, and, exhaust, gases, reduced, footprint, cement, is, a, cementitious, material, that, meets, or, exceeds, the, functional, performance, capabilities, of, portland, cement, various, techniques, are, under, development, one, is, geopolymer, cement, which, incorporates, recycled, materials, thereby, reducing, consumption, of, raw, materials, water, and, energy, another, approach, is, to, reduce, or, eliminate, the, production, and, release, of, damaging, pollutants, and, greenhouse, gasses, particularly, co, 2, recycling, old, cement, in, electric, arc, furnaces, is, another, approach, also, a, team, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, has, developed, the, dupe, process, based, on, the, microbial, activity, of, sporosarcina, pasteurii, a, bacterium, precipitating, calcium, carbonate, which, when, mixed, with, sand, and, urine, can, produce, mortar, blocks, with, a, compressive, strength, 70, of, that, of, concrete, an, overview, of, climate, friendly, methods, for, cement,
