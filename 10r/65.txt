a, spreadsheet, is, a, computer, application, for, computation, organization, analysis, and, storage, of, data, in, tabular, form, spreadsheets, were, developed, as, computerized, analogs, of, paper, accounting, worksheets, the, program, operates, on, data, entered, in, cells, of, a, table, each, cell, may, contain, either, numeric, or, text, data, or, the, results, of, formulas, that, automatically, calculate, and, display, a, value, based, on, the, contents, of, other, cells, the, term, spreadsheet, may, also, refer, to, one, such, electronic, document, spreadsheet, users, can, adjust, any, stored, value, and, observe, the, effects, on, calculated, values, this, makes, the, spreadsheet, useful, for, what, if, analysis, since, many, cases, can, be, rapidly, investigated, without, manual, recalculation, modern, spreadsheet, software, can, have, multiple, interacting, sheets, and, can, display, data, either, as, text, and, numerals, or, in, graphical, form, besides, performing, basic, arithmetic, and, mathematical, functions, modern, spreadsheets, provide, built, in, functions, for, common, financial, accountancy, and, statistical, operations, such, calculations, as, net, present, value, or, standard, deviation, can, be, applied, to, tabular, data, with, a, pre, programmed, function, in, a, formula, spreadsheet, programs, also, provide, conditional, expressions, functions, to, convert, between, text, and, numbers, and, functions, that, operate, on, strings, of, text, spreadsheets, have, replaced, paper, based, systems, throughout, the, business, world, although, they, were, first, developed, for, accounting, or, bookkeeping, tasks, they, now, are, used, extensively, in, any, context, where, tabular, lists, are, built, sorted, and, shared, lanpar, available, in, 1969, was, the, first, electronic, spreadsheet, on, mainframe, and, time, sharing, computers, lanpar, was, an, acronym, language, for, programming, arrays, at, random, visicalc, 1979, was, the, first, electronic, spreadsheet, on, a, microcomputer, and, it, helped, turn, the, apple, ii, into, a, popular, and, widely, used, personal, computer, lotus, 1, 2, 3, was, the, leading, spreadsheet, when, dos, was, the, dominant, operating, system, microsoft, excel, now, has, the, largest, market, share, on, the, windows, and, macintosh, platforms, a, spreadsheet, program, is, a, standard, feature, of, an, office, productivity, suite, in, 2006, google, launched, a, beta, release, spreadsheet, web, application, this, is, currently, known, as, google, sheets, and, one, of, the, applications, provided, in, google, drive, a, spreadsheet, consists, of, a, table, of, cells, arranged, into, rows, and, columns, and, referred, to, by, the, x, and, y, locations, x, locations, the, columns, are, normally, represented, by, letters, a, b, c, etc, while, rows, are, normally, represented, by, numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc, a, single, cell, can, be, referred, to, by, addressing, its, row, and, column, c10, this, electronic, concept, of, cell, references, was, first, introduced, in, lanpar, language, for, programming, arrays, at, random, co, invented, by, rene, pardo, and, remy, landau, and, a, variant, used, in, visicalc, and, known, as, a1, notation, additionally, spreadsheets, have, the, concept, of, a, range, a, group, of, cells, normally, contiguous, for, instance, one, can, refer, to, the, first, ten, cells, in, the, first, column, with, the, range, a1, a10, lanpar, innovated, forward, referencing, natural, order, calculation, which, didn, t, re, appear, until, lotus, 123, and, microsoft, s, multiplan, version, 2, in, modern, spreadsheet, applications, several, spreadsheets, often, known, as, worksheets, or, simply, sheets, are, gathered, together, to, form, a, workbook, a, workbook, is, physically, represented, by, a, file, containing, all, the, data, for, the, book, the, sheets, and, the, cells, with, the, sheets, worksheets, are, normally, represented, by, tabs, that, flip, between, pages, each, one, containing, one, of, the, sheets, although, numbers, changes, this, model, significantly, cells, in, a, multi, sheet, book, add, the, sheet, name, to, their, reference, for, instance, sheet, 1, c10, some, systems, extend, this, syntax, to, allow, cell, references, to, different, workbooks, users, interact, with, sheets, primarily, through, the, cells, a, given, cell, can, hold, data, by, simply, entering, it, in, or, a, formula, which, is, normally, created, by, preceding, the, text, with, an, equals, sign, data, might, include, the, string, of, text, hello, world, the, number, 5, or, the, date, 16, dec, 91, a, formula, would, begin, with, the, equals, sign, 5, 3, but, this, would, normally, be, invisible, because, the, display, shows, the, result, of, the, calculation, 15, in, this, case, not, the, formula, itself, this, may, lead, to, confusion, in, some, cases, the, key, feature, of, spreadsheets, is, the, ability, for, a, formula, to, refer, to, the, contents, of, other, cells, which, may, in, turn, be, the, result, of, a, formula, to, make, such, a, formula, one, replaces, a, number, with, a, cell, reference, for, instance, the, formula, 5, c10, would, produce, the, result, of, multiplying, the, value, in, cell, c10, by, the, number, 5, if, c10, holds, the, value, 3, the, result, will, be, 15, but, c10, might, also, hold, its, formula, referring, to, other, cells, and, so, on, the, ability, to, chain, formulas, together, is, what, gives, a, spreadsheet, its, power, many, problems, can, be, broken, down, into, a, series, of, individual, mathematical, steps, and, these, can, be, assigned, to, individual, formulas, in, cells, some, of, these, formulas, can, apply, to, ranges, as, well, like, the, sum, function, that, adds, up, all, the, numbers, within, a, range, spreadsheets, share, many, principles, and, traits, of, databases, but, spreadsheets, and, databases, are, not, the, same, things, a, spreadsheet, is, essentially, just, one, table, whereas, a, database, is, a, collection, of, many, tables, with, machine, readable, semantic, relationships, while, it, is, true, that, a, workbook, that, contains, three, sheets, is, indeed, a, file, containing, multiple, tables, that, can, interact, with, each, other, it, lacks, the, relational, structure, of, a, database, spreadsheets, and, databases, are, interoperable, sheets, can, be, imported, into, databases, to, become, tables, within, them, and, database, queries, can, be, exported, into, spreadsheets, for, further, analysis, a, spreadsheet, program, is, one, of, the, main, components, of, an, office, productivity, suite, which, usually, also, contains, a, word, processor, a, presentation, program, and, a, database, management, system, programs, within, a, suite, use, similar, commands, for, similar, functions, usually, sharing, data, between, the, components, is, easier, than, with, a, non, integrated, collection, of, functionally, equivalent, programs, this, was, particularly, an, advantage, at, a, time, when, many, personal, computer, systems, used, text, mode, displays, and, commands, instead, of, a, graphical, user, interface, humans, have, organized, data, into, tables, that, is, grids, of, columns, and, rows, since, ancient, times, the, babylonians, used, clay, tablets, to, store, data, as, far, back, as, 1800, bce, other, examples, can, be, found, in, book, keeping, ledgers, and, astronomical, records, since, at, least, 1906, the, term, spread, sheet, has, been, used, in, accounting, to, mean, a, grid, of, columns, and, rows, in, a, ledger, and, prior, to, the, rise, of, computerized, spreadsheets, spread, referred, to, a, newspaper, or, magazine, item, text, or, graphics, that, covers, two, facing, pages, extending, across, the, centerfold, and, treating, the, two, pages, as, one, large, page, the, compound, word, spread, sheet, came, to, mean, the, format, used, to, present, book, keeping, ledgers, with, columns, for, categories, of, expenditures, across, the, top, invoices, listed, down, the, left, margin, and, the, amount, of, each, payment, in, the, cell, where, its, row, and, column, intersect, which, were, traditionally, a, spread, across, facing, pages, of, a, bound, ledger, book, for, keeping, accounting, records, or, on, oversized, sheets, of, paper, termed, analysis, paper, ruled, into, rows, and, columns, in, that, format, and, approximately, twice, as, wide, as, ordinary, paper, a, batch, spreadsheet, is, indistinguishable, from, a, batch, compiler, with, added, input, data, producing, an, output, report, i, e, a, 4gl, or, conventional, non, interactive, batch, computer, program, however, this, concept, of, an, electronic, spreadsheet, was, outlined, in, the, 1961, paper, budgeting, models, and, system, simulation, by, richard, mattessich, the, subsequent, work, by, mattessich, 1964a, chpt, 9, accounting, and, analytical, methods, and, its, companion, volume, mattessich, 1964b, simulation, of, the, firm, through, a, budget, computer, program, applied, computerized, spreadsheets, to, accounting, and, budgeting, systems, on, mainframe, computers, programmed, in, fortran, iv, these, batch, spreadsheets, dealt, primarily, with, the, addition, or, subtraction, of, entire, columns, or, rows, of, input, variables, rather, than, individual, cells, in, 1962, this, concept, of, the, spreadsheet, called, bcl, for, business, computer, language, was, implemented, on, an, ibm, 1130, and, in, 1963, was, ported, to, an, ibm, 7040, by, r, brian, walsh, at, marquette, university, wisconsin, this, program, was, written, in, fortran, primitive, timesharing, was, available, on, those, machines, in, 1968, bcl, was, ported, by, walsh, to, the, ibm, 360, 67, timesharing, machine, at, washington, state, university, it, was, used, to, assist, in, the, teaching, of, finance, to, business, students, students, were, able, to, take, information, prepared, by, the, professor, and, manipulate, it, to, represent, it, and, show, ratios, etc, in, 1964, a, book, entitled, business, computer, language, was, written, by, kimball, stoffells, and, walsh, both, the, book, and, program, were, copyrighted, in, 1966, and, years, later, that, copyright, was, renewed, applied, data, resources, had, a, fortran, preprocessor, called, empires, in, the, late, 1960s, xerox, used, bcl, to, develop, a, more, sophisticated, version, for, their, timesharing, system, a, key, invention, in, the, development, of, electronic, spreadsheets, was, made, by, rene, k, pardo, and, remy, landau, who, filed, in, 1970, u, s, patent, 4, 398, 249, on, a, spreadsheet, automatic, natural, order, calculation, algorithm, while, the, patent, was, initially, rejected, by, the, patent, office, as, being, a, purely, mathematical, invention, following, 12, years, of, appeals, pardo, and, landau, won, a, landmark, court, case, at, the, predecessor, court, of, the, federal, circuit, ccpa, overturning, the, patent, office, in, 1983, establishing, that, something, does, not, cease, to, become, patentable, merely, because, the, point, of, novelty, is, in, an, algorithm, however, in, 1995, a, federal, district, court, ruled, the, patent, unenforceable, due, to, inequitable, conduct, by, the, inventors, during, the, application, process, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, federal, circuit, upheld, that, decision, in, 1996, the, actual, software, was, called, lanpar, language, for, programming, arrays, at, random, this, was, conceived, and, entirely, developed, in, the, summer, of, 1969, following, pardo, and, landau, s, recent, graduation, from, harvard, university, co, inventor, rene, pardo, recalls, that, he, felt, that, one, manager, at, bell, canada, should, not, have, to, depend, on, programmers, to, program, and, modify, budgeting, forms, and, he, thought, of, letting, users, type, out, forms, in, any, order, and, having, an, electronic, computer, calculate, results, in, the, right, order, forward, referencing, natural, order, calculation, pardo, and, landau, developed, and, implemented, the, software, in, 1969, lanpar, was, used, by, bell, canada, at, t, and, the, 18, operating, telephone, companies, nationwide, for, their, local, and, national, budgeting, operations, lanpar, was, also, used, by, general, motors, its, uniqueness, was, pardo, s, co, invention, incorporating, forward, referencing, natural, order, calculation, one, of, the, first, non, procedural, computer, languages, as, opposed, to, left, to, right, top, to, bottom, sequence, for, calculating, the, results, in, each, cell, that, was, used, by, visicalc, supercalc, and, the, first, version, of, multiplan, without, forward, referencing, natural, order, calculation, the, user, had, to, refresh, the, spreadsheet, until, the, values, in, all, cells, remained, unchanged, once, the, cell, values, stayed, constant, the, user, was, assured, that, there, were, no, remaining, forward, references, within, the, spreadsheet, in, 1968, three, former, employees, from, the, general, electric, computer, company, headquartered, in, phoenix, arizona, set, out, to, start, their, own, software, development, house, a, leroy, ellison, harry, n, cantrell, and, russell, e, edwards, found, themselves, doing, a, large, number, of, calculations, when, making, tables, for, the, business, plans, that, they, were, presenting, to, venture, capitalists, they, decided, to, save, themselves, a, lot, of, effort, and, wrote, a, computer, program, that, produced, their, tables, for, them, this, program, originally, conceived, as, a, simple, utility, for, their, personal, use, would, turn, out, to, be, the, first, software, product, offered, by, the, company, that, would, become, known, as, capex, corporation, autoplan, ran, on, ge, s, time, sharing, service, afterward, a, version, that, ran, on, ibm, mainframes, was, introduced, under, the, name, autotab, national, css, offered, a, similar, product, csstab, which, had, a, moderate, timesharing, user, base, by, the, early, 1970s, a, major, application, was, opinion, research, tabulation, autoplan, autotab, was, not, a, wysiwyg, interactive, spreadsheet, program, it, was, a, simple, scripting, language, for, spreadsheets, the, user, defined, the, names, and, labels, for, the, rows, and, columns, then, the, formulas, that, defined, each, row, or, column, in, 1975, autotab, ii, was, advertised, as, extending, the, original, to, a, maximum, of, 1, 500, rows, and, columns, combined, in, any, proportion, the, user, requires, ge, information, services, which, operated, the, time, sharing, service, also, launched, its, own, spreadsheet, system, financial, analysis, language, fal, circa, 1974, it, was, later, supplemented, by, an, additional, spreadsheet, language, tabol, which, was, developed, by, an, independent, author, oliver, vellacott, in, the, uk, both, fal, and, tabol, were, integrated, with, geis, s, database, system, dms, the, ibm, financial, planning, and, control, system, was, developed, in, 1976, by, brian, ingham, at, ibm, canada, it, was, implemented, by, ibm, in, at, least, 30, countries, it, ran, on, an, ibm, mainframe, and, was, the, first, application, for, financial, planning, developed, with, apl, that, completely, hid, the, programming, language, from, the, end, user, through, ibm, s, vm, operating, system, it, was, among, the, first, programs, to, auto, update, each, copy, of, the, application, as, new, versions, were, released, users, could, specify, simple, mathematical, relationships, between, rows, and, between, columns, compared, to, any, contemporary, alternatives, it, could, support, very, large, spreadsheets, it, loaded, actual, financial, planning, data, drawn, from, the, legacy, batch, system, into, each, user, s, spreadsheet, monthly, it, was, designed, to, optimize, the, power, of, apl, through, object, kernels, increasing, program, efficiency, by, as, much, as, 50, fold, over, traditional, programming, approaches, an, example, of, an, early, industrial, weight, spreadsheet, was, apldot, developed, in, 1976, at, the, united, states, railway, association, on, an, ibm, 360, 91, running, at, the, johns, hopkins, university, applied, physics, laboratory, in, laurel, md, the, application, was, used, successfully, for, many, years, in, developing, such, applications, as, financial, and, costing, models, for, the, us, congress, and, for, conrail, apldot, was, dubbed, a, spreadsheet, because, financial, analysts, and, strategic, planners, used, it, to, solve, the, same, problems, they, addressed, with, paper, spreadsheet, pads, the, concept, of, spreadsheets, became, widely, known, due, to, visicalc, developed, for, the, apple, ii, in, 1979, by, visicorp, staff, dan, bricklin, and, bob, frankston, significantly, it, also, turned, the, personal, computer, from, a, hobby, for, computer, enthusiasts, into, a, business, tool, visicalc, was, the, first, spreadsheet, that, combined, many, of, the, essential, features, of, modern, spreadsheet, applications, such, as, a, wysiwyg, interactive, user, interface, automatic, recalculation, status, and, formula, lines, range, copying, with, relative, and, absolute, references, and, formula, building, by, selecting, referenced, cells, unaware, of, lanpar, at, the, time, pc, world, magazine, called, visicalc, the, first, electronic, spreadsheet, bricklin, has, spoken, of, watching, his, university, professor, create, a, table, of, calculation, results, on, a, blackboard, when, the, professor, found, an, error, he, had, to, tediously, erase, and, rewrite, several, sequential, entries, in, the, table, triggering, bricklin, to, think, that, he, could, replicate, the, process, on, a, computer, using, the, blackboard, as, the, model, to, view, results, of, underlying, formulas, his, idea, became, visicalc, visicalc, for, the, apple, ii, went, on, to, become, the, first, killer, application, a, program, so, compelling, people, would, buy, a, particular, computer, just, to, use, it, it, was, ported, to, other, computers, including, cp, m, machines, atari, 8, bit, computers, and, the, commodore, pet, but, visicalc, remains, best, known, as, an, apple, ii, program, supercalc, was, a, spreadsheet, application, published, by, sorcim, in, 1980, and, originally, bundled, along, with, wordstar, as, part, of, the, cp, m, software, package, included, with, the, osborne, 1, portable, computer, it, quickly, became, the, de, facto, standard, spreadsheet, for, cp, m, the, introduction, of, lotus, 1, 2, 3, in, november, 1982, accelerated, the, acceptance, of, the, ibm, personal, computer, it, was, written, especially, for, ibm, pc, dos, and, had, improvements, in, speed, and, graphics, compared, to, visicalc, on, the, apple, ii, this, helped, it, grow, in, popularity, lotus, 1, 2, 3, was, the, leading, spreadsheet, for, several, years, microsoft, released, the, first, version, of, excel, for, the, apple, macintosh, on, september, 30, 1985, and, then, ported, it, to, windows, with, the, first, version, being, numbered, 2, 05, to, synchronize, with, the, macintosh, version, 2, 2, and, released, in, november, 1987, microsoft, s, windows, 3, x, platforms, of, the, early, 1990s, made, it, possible, for, their, excel, spreadsheet, application, to, take, market, share, from, lotus, by, the, time, lotus, responded, with, usable, windows, products, microsoft, had, begun, to, assemble, their, office, suite, by, 1995, excel, was, the, market, leader, edging, out, lotus, 1, 2, 3, and, in, 2013, ibm, discontinued, lotus, 1, 2, 3, altogether, in, 2006, google, launched, their, beta, release, google, sheets, a, web, based, spreadsheet, application, that, can, be, accessed, by, multiple, users, from, any, device, type, using, a, compatible, web, browser, it, can, be, used, online, and, offline, with, or, without, internet, connectivity, google, sheets, originated, from, a, web, based, spreadsheet, application, xl2web, developed, by, 2web, technologies, combined, with, docverse, which, enabled, multiple, user, online, collaboration, of, office, documents, in, 2016, collabora, online, calc, was, launched, notable, in, that, the, web, based, spreadsheet, could, be, hosted, and, integrated, into, any, environment, without, dependency, on, a, 3rd, party, for, authentication, or, maintenance, collabora, online, runs, libreoffice, kit, at, its, core, which, grew, from, staroffice, that, was, launched, 39, years, ago, in, 1985, notable, current, spreadsheet, software, discontinued, spreadsheet, software, several, companies, have, attempted, to, break, into, the, spreadsheet, market, with, programs, based, on, very, different, paradigms, lotus, introduced, what, is, likely, the, most, successful, example, lotus, improv, which, saw, some, commercial, success, notably, in, the, financial, world, where, its, powerful, data, mining, capabilities, remain, well, respected, to, this, day, spreadsheet, 2000, attempted, to, dramatically, simplify, formula, construction, but, was, generally, not, successful, the, main, concepts, are, those, of, a, grid, of, cells, called, a, sheet, with, either, raw, data, called, values, or, formulas, in, the, cells, formulas, say, how, to, mechanically, compute, new, values, from, existing, values, values, are, general, numbers, but, can, also, be, pure, text, dates, months, etc, extensions, of, these, concepts, include, logical, spreadsheets, various, tools, for, programming, sheets, visualizing, data, remotely, connecting, sheets, displaying, cells, dependencies, etc, are, commonly, provided, a, cell, can, be, thought, of, as, a, box, for, holding, data, a, single, cell, is, usually, referenced, by, its, column, and, row, c2, would, represent, the, cell, containing, the, value, 30, in, the, example, table, below, usually, rows, representing, the, dependent, variables, are, referenced, in, decimal, notation, starting, from, 1, while, columns, representing, the, independent, variables, use, 26, adic, bijective, numeration, using, the, letters, a, z, as, numerals, its, physical, size, can, usually, be, tailored, to, its, content, by, dragging, its, height, or, width, at, box, intersections, or, for, entire, columns, or, rows, by, dragging, the, column, or, row, headers, an, array, of, cells, is, called, a, sheet, or, worksheet, it, is, analogous, to, an, array, of, variables, in, a, conventional, computer, program, although, certain, unchanging, values, once, entered, could, be, considered, by, the, same, analogy, constants, in, most, implementations, many, worksheets, may, be, located, within, a, single, spreadsheet, a, worksheet, is, simply, a, subset, of, the, spreadsheet, divided, for, the, sake, of, clarity, functionally, the, spreadsheet, operates, as, a, whole, and, all, cells, operate, as, global, variables, within, the, spreadsheet, each, variable, having, read, access, only, except, its, containing, cell, a, cell, may, contain, a, value, or, a, formula, or, it, may, simply, be, left, empty, by, convention, formulas, usually, begin, with, sign, a, value, can, be, entered, from, the, computer, keyboard, by, directly, typing, into, the, cell, itself, alternatively, a, value, can, be, based, on, a, formula, see, below, which, might, perform, a, calculation, display, the, current, date, or, time, or, retrieve, external, data, such, as, a, stock, quote, or, a, database, value, the, spreadsheet, value, rule, computer, scientist, alan, kay, used, the, term, value, rule, to, summarize, a, spreadsheet, s, operation, a, cell, s, value, relies, solely, on, the, formula, the, user, has, typed, into, the, cell, the, formula, may, rely, on, the, value, of, other, cells, but, those, cells, are, likewise, restricted, to, user, entered, data, or, formulas, there, are, no, side, effects, to, calculating, a, formula, the, only, output, is, to, display, the, calculated, result, inside, its, occupying, cell, there, is, no, natural, mechanism, for, permanently, modifying, the, contents, of, a, cell, unless, the, user, manually, modifies, the, cell, s, contents, in, the, context, of, programming, languages, this, yields, a, limited, form, of, first, order, functional, programming, a, standard, of, spreadsheets, since, the, 1980s, this, optional, feature, eliminates, the, need, to, manually, request, the, spreadsheet, program, to, recalculate, values, nowadays, typically, the, default, option, unless, specifically, switched, off, for, large, spreadsheets, usually, to, improve, performance, some, earlier, spreadsheets, required, a, manual, request, to, recalculate, since, the, recalculation, of, large, or, complex, spreadsheets, often, reduced, data, entry, speed, many, modern, spreadsheets, still, retain, this, option, recalculation, generally, requires, that, there, are, no, circular, dependencies, in, a, spreadsheet, a, dependency, graph, is, a, graph, that, has, a, vertex, for, each, object, to, be, updated, and, an, edge, connecting, two, objects, whenever, one, of, them, needs, to, be, updated, earlier, than, the, other, dependency, graphs, without, circular, dependencies, form, directed, acyclic, graphs, representations, of, partial, orderings, in, this, case, across, a, spreadsheet, that, can, be, relied, upon, to, give, a, definite, result, this, feature, refers, to, updating, a, cell, s, contents, periodically, with, a, value, from, an, external, source, such, as, a, cell, in, a, remote, spreadsheet, for, shared, web, based, spreadsheets, it, applies, to, immediately, updating, cells, another, user, has, updated, all, dependent, cells, must, be, updated, also, once, entered, selected, cells, or, the, entire, spreadsheet, can, optionally, be, locked, to, prevent, accidental, overwriting, typically, this, would, apply, to, cells, containing, formulas, but, might, apply, to, cells, containing, constants, such, as, a, kilogram, pounds, conversion, factor, 2, 20462262, to, eight, decimal, places, even, though, individual, cells, are, marked, as, locked, the, spreadsheet, data, are, not, protected, until, the, feature, is, activated, in, the, file, preferences, a, cell, or, range, can, optionally, be, defined, to, specify, how, the, value, is, displayed, the, default, display, format, is, usually, set, by, its, initial, content, if, not, specifically, previously, set, so, that, for, example, 31, 12, 2007, or, 31, dec, 2007, would, default, to, the, cell, format, of, date, similarly, adding, a, sign, after, a, numeric, value, would, tag, the, cell, as, a, percentage, cell, format, the, cell, contents, are, not, changed, by, this, format, only, the, displayed, value, some, cell, formats, such, as, numeric, or, currency, can, also, specify, the, number, of, decimal, places, this, can, allow, invalid, operations, such, as, doing, multiplication, on, a, cell, containing, a, date, resulting, in, illogical, results, without, an, appropriate, warning, depending, on, the, capability, of, the, spreadsheet, application, each, cell, like, its, counterpart, the, style, in, a, word, processor, can, be, separately, formatted, using, the, attributes, of, either, the, content, point, size, color, bold, or, italic, or, the, cell, border, thickness, background, shading, color, to, aid, the, readability, of, a, spreadsheet, cell, formatting, may, be, conditionally, applied, to, data, for, example, a, negative, number, may, be, displayed, in, red, a, cell, s, formatting, does, not, typically, affect, its, content, and, depending, on, how, cells, are, referenced, or, copied, to, other, worksheets, or, applications, the, formatting, may, not, be, carried, with, the, content, in, most, implementations, a, cell, or, group, of, cells, in, a, column, or, row, can, be, named, enabling, the, user, to, refer, to, those, cells, by, a, name, rather, than, by, a, grid, reference, names, must, be, unique, within, the, spreadsheet, but, when, using, multiple, sheets, in, a, spreadsheet, file, an, identically, named, cell, range, on, each, sheet, can, be, used, if, it, is, distinguished, by, adding, the, sheet, name, one, reason, for, this, usage, is, for, creating, or, running, macros, that, repeat, a, command, across, many, sheets, another, reason, is, that, formulas, with, named, variables, are, readily, checked, against, the, algebra, they, are, intended, to, implement, they, resemble, fortran, expressions, the, use, of, named, variables, and, named, functions, also, makes, the, spreadsheet, structure, more, transparent, in, place, of, a, named, cell, an, alternative, approach, is, to, use, a, cell, or, grid, reference, most, cell, references, indicate, another, cell, in, the, same, spreadsheet, but, a, cell, reference, can, also, refer, to, a, cell, in, a, different, sheet, within, the, same, spreadsheet, or, depending, on, the, implementation, to, a, cell, in, another, spreadsheet, entirely, or, a, value, from, a, remote, application, a, typical, cell, reference, in, a1, style, consists, of, one, or, two, case, insensitive, letters, to, identify, the, column, if, there, are, up, to, 256, columns, a, z, and, aa, iv, followed, by, a, row, number, e, g, in, the, range, 1, 65536, either, part, can, be, relative, it, changes, when, the, formula, it, is, in, is, moved, or, copied, or, absolute, indicated, with, in, front, of, the, part, concerned, of, the, cell, reference, the, alternative, r1c1, reference, style, consists, of, the, letter, r, the, row, number, the, letter, c, and, the, column, number, relative, row, or, column, numbers, are, indicated, by, enclosing, the, number, in, square, brackets, most, current, spreadsheets, use, the, a1, style, some, providing, the, r1c1, style, as, a, compatibility, option, when, the, computer, calculates, a, formula, in, one, cell, to, update, the, displayed, value, of, that, cell, cell, reference, s, in, that, cell, naming, some, other, cell, s, causes, the, computer, to, fetch, the, value, of, the, named, cell, s, a, cell, on, the, same, sheet, is, usually, addressed, as, a1, a, cell, on, a, different, sheet, of, the, same, spreadsheet, is, usually, addressed, as, some, spreadsheet, implementations, in, excel, allow, cell, references, to, another, spreadsheet, not, the, currently, open, and, active, file, on, the, same, computer, or, a, local, network, it, may, also, refer, to, a, cell, in, another, open, and, active, spreadsheet, on, the, same, computer, or, network, that, is, defined, as, shareable, these, references, contain, the, complete, filename, such, as, in, a, spreadsheet, references, to, cells, automatically, update, when, new, rows, or, columns, are, inserted, or, deleted, care, must, be, taken, however, when, adding, a, row, immediately, before, a, set, of, column, totals, to, ensure, that, the, totals, reflect, the, values, of, the, additional, rows, which, they, often, do, not, a, circular, reference, occurs, when, the, formula, in, one, cell, refers, directly, or, indirectly, through, a, chain, of, cell, references, to, another, cell, that, refers, back, to, the, first, cell, many, common, errors, cause, circular, references, however, some, valid, techniques, use, circular, references, these, techniques, after, many, spreadsheet, recalculations, usually, converge, on, the, correct, values, for, those, cells, likewise, instead, of, using, a, named, range, of, cells, a, range, reference, can, be, used, reference, to, a, range, of, cells, is, typical, of, the, form, a1, a6, which, specifies, all, the, cells, in, the, range, a1, through, to, a6, a, formula, such, as, sum, a1, a6, would, add, all, the, cells, specified, and, put, the, result, in, the, cell, containing, the, formula, itself, in, the, earliest, spreadsheets, cells, were, a, simple, two, dimensional, grid, over, time, the, model, has, expanded, to, include, a, third, dimension, and, in, some, cases, a, series, of, named, grids, called, sheets, the, most, advanced, examples, allow, inversion, and, rotation, operations, which, can, slice, and, project, the, data, set, in, various, ways, a, formula, identifies, the, calculation, needed, to, place, the, result, in, the, cell, it, is, contained, within, a, cell, containing, a, formula, therefore, has, two, display, components, the, formula, itself, and, the, resulting, value, the, formula, is, normally, only, shown, when, the, cell, is, selected, by, clicking, the, mouse, over, a, particular, cell, otherwise, it, contains, the, result, of, the, calculation, a, formula, assigns, values, to, a, cell, or, range, of, cells, and, typically, has, the, format, where, the, expression, consists, of, when, a, cell, contains, a, formula, it, often, contains, references, to, other, cells, such, a, cell, reference, is, a, type, of, variable, its, value, is, the, value, of, the, referenced, cell, or, some, derivation, of, it, if, that, cell, in, turn, references, other, cells, the, value, depends, on, the, values, of, those, references, can, be, relative, e, g, a1, or, b1, b3, absolute, e, g, a, 1, or, b, 1, b, 3, or, mixed, row, or, column, wise, absolute, relative, e, g, a1, is, column, wise, absolute, and, a, 1, is, row, wise, absolute, the, available, options, for, valid, formulas, depend, on, the, particular, spreadsheet, implementation, but, in, general, most, arithmetic, operations, and, quite, complex, nested, conditional, operations, can, be, performed, by, most, of, today, s, commercial, spreadsheets, modern, implementations, also, offer, functions, to, access, custom, build, functions, remote, data, and, applications, a, formula, may, contain, a, condition, or, nested, conditions, with, or, without, an, actual, calculation, and, is, sometimes, used, purely, to, identify, and, highlight, errors, in, the, example, below, it, is, assumed, the, sum, of, a, column, of, percentages, a1, through, a6, is, tested, for, validity, and, an, explicit, message, put, into, the, adjacent, right, hand, cell, further, examples, the, best, way, to, build, up, conditional, statements, is, step, by, step, composing, followed, by, trial, and, error, testing, and, refining, code, a, spreadsheet, does, not, have, to, contain, any, formulas, at, all, in, which, case, it, could, be, considered, merely, a, collection, of, data, arranged, in, rows, and, columns, a, database, like, a, calendar, timetable, or, simple, list, because, of, its, ease, of, use, formatting, and, hyperlinking, capabilities, many, spreadsheets, are, used, solely, for, this, purpose, spreadsheets, usually, contain, several, supplied, functions, such, as, arithmetic, operations, for, example, summations, averages, and, so, forth, trigonometric, functions, statistical, functions, and, so, forth, in, addition, there, is, often, a, provision, for, user, defined, functions, in, microsoft, excel, these, functions, are, defined, using, visual, basic, for, applications, in, the, supplied, visual, basic, editor, and, such, functions, are, automatically, accessible, on, the, worksheet, also, programs, can, be, written, that, pull, information, from, the, worksheet, perform, some, calculations, and, report, the, results, back, to, the, worksheet, in, the, figure, the, name, sq, is, user, assigned, and, the, function, sq, is, introduced, using, the, visual, basic, editor, supplied, with, excel, name, manager, displays, the, spreadsheet, definitions, of, named, variables, x, y, functions, themselves, cannot, write, into, the, worksheet, but, simply, return, their, evaluation, however, in, microsoft, excel, subroutines, can, write, values, or, text, found, within, the, subroutine, directly, to, the, spreadsheet, the, figure, shows, the, visual, basic, code, for, a, subroutine, that, reads, each, member, of, the, named, column, variable, x, calculates, its, square, and, writes, this, value, into, the, corresponding, element, of, named, column, variable, y, the, y, column, contains, no, formula, because, its, values, are, calculated, in, the, subroutine, not, on, the, spreadsheet, and, simply, are, written, in, whenever, a, reference, is, made, to, a, cell, or, group, of, cells, that, are, not, located, within, the, current, physical, spreadsheet, file, it, is, considered, as, accessing, a, remote, spreadsheet, the, contents, of, the, referenced, cell, may, be, accessed, either, on, the, first, reference, with, a, manual, update, or, more, recently, in, the, case, of, web, based, spreadsheets, as, a, near, real, time, value, with, a, specified, automatic, refresh, interval, many, spreadsheet, applications, permit, charts, and, graphs, e, g, histograms, pie, charts, to, be, generated, from, specified, groups, of, cells, that, are, dynamically, re, built, as, cell, contents, change, the, generated, graphic, component, can, either, be, embedded, within, the, current, sheet, or, added, as, a, separate, object, to, create, an, excel, histogram, a, formula, based, on, the, rept, function, can, be, used, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, first, javelin, software, and, lotus, improv, appeared, unlike, models, in, a, conventional, spreadsheet, they, utilized, models, built, on, objects, called, variables, not, on, data, in, cells, of, a, report, these, multi, dimensional, spreadsheets, enabled, viewing, data, and, algorithms, in, various, self, documenting, ways, including, simultaneous, multiple, synchronized, views, for, example, users, of, javelin, could, move, through, the, connections, between, variables, on, a, diagram, while, seeing, the, logical, roots, and, branches, of, each, variable, this, is, an, example, of, what, is, perhaps, its, primary, contribution, of, the, earlier, javelin, the, concept, of, traceability, of, a, user, s, logic, or, model, structure, through, its, twelve, views, a, complex, model, can, be, dissected, and, understood, by, others, who, had, no, role, in, its, creation, in, these, programs, a, time, series, or, any, variable, was, an, object, in, itself, not, a, collection, of, cells, that, happen, to, appear, in, a, row, or, column, variables, could, have, many, attributes, including, complete, awareness, of, their, connections, to, all, other, variables, data, references, and, text, and, image, notes, calculations, were, performed, on, these, objects, as, opposed, to, a, range, of, cells, so, adding, two, time, series, automatically, aligns, them, in, calendar, time, or, in, a, user, defined, time, frame, data, were, independent, of, worksheets, variables, and, therefore, data, could, not, be, destroyed, by, deleting, a, row, column, or, entire, worksheet, for, instance, january, s, costs, are, subtracted, from, january, s, revenues, regardless, of, where, or, whether, either, appears, in, a, worksheet, this, permits, actions, later, used, in, pivot, tables, except, that, flexible, manipulation, of, report, tables, was, but, one, of, many, capabilities, supported, by, variables, moreover, if, costs, were, entered, by, week, and, revenues, by, month, the, program, could, allocate, or, interpolate, as, appropriate, this, object, design, enabled, variables, and, whole, models, to, reference, each, other, with, user, defined, variable, names, and, to, perform, multidimensional, analysis, and, massive, but, easily, editable, consolidations, trapeze, a, spreadsheet, on, the, mac, went, further, and, explicitly, supported, not, just, table, columns, but, also, matrix, operators, spreadsheets, that, have, a, formula, language, based, upon, logical, expressions, rather, than, arithmetic, expressions, are, known, as, logical, spreadsheets, such, spreadsheets, can, be, used, to, reason, deductively, about, their, cell, values, just, as, the, early, programming, languages, were, designed, to, generate, spreadsheet, printouts, programming, techniques, themselves, have, evolved, to, process, tables, also, known, as, spreadsheets, or, matrices, of, data, more, efficiently, in, the, computer, itself, spreadsheets, are, a, popular, end, user, development, tool, eud, denotes, activities, or, techniques, in, which, people, who, are, not, professional, developers, create, automated, behavior, and, complex, data, objects, without, significant, knowledge, of, a, programming, language, many, people, find, it, easier, to, perform, calculations, in, spreadsheets, than, by, writing, the, equivalent, sequential, program, this, is, due, to, several, traits, of, spreadsheets, a, spreadsheet, program, is, designed, to, perform, general, computation, tasks, using, spatial, relationships, rather, than, time, as, the, primary, organizing, principle, it, is, often, convenient, to, think, of, a, spreadsheet, as, a, mathematical, graph, where, the, nodes, are, spreadsheet, cells, and, the, edges, are, references, to, other, cells, specified, in, formulas, this, is, often, called, the, dependency, graph, of, the, spreadsheet, references, between, cells, can, take, advantage, of, spatial, concepts, such, as, relative, position, and, absolute, position, as, well, as, named, locations, to, make, the, spreadsheet, formulas, easier, to, understand, and, manage, spreadsheets, usually, attempt, to, automatically, update, cells, when, the, cells, depend, on, change, the, earliest, spreadsheets, used, simple, tactics, like, evaluating, cells, in, a, particular, order, but, modern, spreadsheets, calculate, following, a, minimal, recomputation, order, from, the, dependency, graph, later, spreadsheets, also, include, a, limited, ability, to, propagate, values, in, reverse, altering, source, values, so, that, a, particular, answer, is, reached, in, a, certain, cell, since, spreadsheet, cell, formulas, are, not, generally, invertible, though, this, technique, is, of, somewhat, limited, value, many, of, the, concepts, common, to, sequential, programming, models, have, analogs, in, the, spreadsheet, world, for, example, the, sequential, model, of, the, indexed, loop, is, usually, represented, as, a, table, of, cells, with, similar, formulas, normally, differing, only, in, which, cells, they, reference, spreadsheets, have, evolved, to, use, scripting, programming, languages, like, vba, as, a, tool, for, extensibility, beyond, what, the, spreadsheet, language, makes, easy, while, spreadsheets, represented, a, major, step, forward, in, quantitative, modeling, they, have, deficiencies, their, shortcomings, include, the, perceived, unfriendliness, of, alpha, numeric, cell, addresses, other, problems, associated, with, spreadsheets, include, while, there, are, built, in, and, third, party, tools, for, desktop, spreadsheet, applications, that, address, some, of, these, shortcomings, awareness, and, use, of, these, is, generally, low, a, good, example, of, this, is, that, 55, of, capital, market, professionals, don, t, know, how, their, spreadsheets, are, audited, only, 6, invest, in, a, third, party, solution, spreadsheet, risk, is, the, risk, associated, with, deriving, a, materially, incorrect, value, from, a, spreadsheet, application, that, will, be, utilized, in, making, a, related, usually, numerically, based, decision, examples, include, the, valuation, of, an, asset, the, determination, of, financial, accounts, the, calculation, of, medicinal, doses, or, the, size, of, a, load, bearing, beam, for, structural, engineering, the, risk, may, arise, from, inputting, erroneous, or, fraudulent, data, values, from, mistakes, or, incorrect, changes, within, the, logic, of, the, spreadsheet, or, the, omission, of, relevant, updates, e, g, out, of, date, exchange, rates, some, single, instance, errors, have, exceeded, us, 1, billion, because, spreadsheet, risk, is, principally, linked, to, the, actions, or, inaction, of, individuals, it, is, defined, as, a, sub, category, of, operational, risk, despite, this, research, carried, out, by, clusterseven, revealed, that, around, half, 48, of, c, level, executives, and, senior, managers, at, firms, reporting, annual, revenues, over, 50m, said, there, were, either, no, usage, controls, at, all, or, poorly, applied, manual, processes, over, the, use, of, spreadsheets, at, the, firms, in, 2013, thomas, herndon, a, graduate, student, of, economics, at, the, university, of, massachusetts, amherst, found, major, coding, flaws, in, the, spreadsheet, used, by, the, economists, carmen, reinhart, and, kenneth, rogoff, in, growth, in, a, time, of, debt, a, very, influential, 2010, journal, article, the, reinhart, and, rogoff, article, was, widely, used, as, justification, to, drive, 2010, 2013, european, austerity, programs
