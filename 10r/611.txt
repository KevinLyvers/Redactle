a, space, station, or, orbital, station, is, a, spacecraft, which, remains, in, orbit, and, hosts, humans, for, extended, periods, of, time, it, therefore, is, an, artificial, satellite, featuring, habitation, facilities, the, purpose, of, maintaining, a, space, station, varies, depending, on, the, program, most, often, space, stations, have, been, research, stations, but, they, have, also, served, military, or, commercial, uses, such, as, hosting, space, tourists, space, stations, have, been, hosting, the, only, continuous, presence, of, humans, in, space, the, first, space, station, was, salyut, 1, 1971, hosting, the, first, crew, of, the, ill, fated, soyuz, 11, consecutively, space, stations, have, been, operated, since, skylab, 1973, and, occupied, since, 1987, with, the, salyut, successor, mir, uninterrupted, occupation, has, been, sustained, since, the, operational, transition, from, the, mir, to, the, international, space, station, iss, with, its, first, occupation, in, 2000, currently, there, are, two, fully, operational, space, stations, the, international, space, station, iss, and, china, s, tiangong, space, station, tss, which, have, been, occupied, since, october, 2000, with, expedition, 1, and, since, june, 2022, with, shenzhou, 14, the, highest, number, of, people, at, the, same, time, on, one, space, station, has, been, 13, first, achieved, with, the, eleven, day, docking, to, the, iss, of, the, 127th, space, shuttle, mission, in, 2009, the, record, for, most, people, on, all, space, stations, at, the, same, time, has, been, 17, first, on, may, 30, 2023, with, 11, people, on, the, iss, and, 6, on, the, tss, space, stations, are, most, often, modular, featuring, docking, ports, through, which, they, are, built, and, maintained, allowing, the, joining, or, movement, of, modules, and, the, docking, of, other, spacecrafts, for, the, exchange, of, people, supplies, and, tools, while, space, stations, generally, do, not, leave, their, orbit, they, do, feature, thrusters, for, station, keeping, the, first, mention, of, anything, resembling, a, space, station, occurred, in, edward, everett, hale, s, 1868, the, brick, moon, the, first, to, give, serious, scientifically, grounded, consideration, to, space, stations, were, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, and, hermann, oberth, about, two, decades, apart, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, 1929, herman, poto, nik, s, the, problem, of, space, travel, was, published, the, first, to, envision, a, rotating, wheel, space, station, to, create, artificial, gravity, conceptualized, during, the, second, world, war, the, sun, gun, was, a, theoretical, orbital, weapon, orbiting, earth, at, a, height, of, 8, 200, kilometres, 5, 100, mi, no, further, research, was, ever, conducted, in, 1951, wernher, von, braun, published, a, concept, for, a, rotating, wheel, space, station, in, collier, s, weekly, referencing, poto, nik, s, idea, however, development, of, a, rotating, station, was, never, begun, in, the, 20th, century, the, first, human, flew, to, space, and, concluded, the, first, orbit, on, april, 12, 1961, with, vostok, 1, the, apollo, program, had, in, its, early, planning, instead, of, a, lunar, landing, a, crewed, lunar, orbital, flight, and, an, orbital, laboratory, station, in, orbit, of, earth, at, times, called, project, olympus, as, two, different, possible, program, goals, until, the, kennedy, administration, sped, ahead, and, made, the, apollo, program, focus, on, what, was, originally, planned, to, come, after, it, the, lunar, landing, the, project, olympus, space, station, or, orbiting, laboratory, of, the, apollo, program, was, proposed, as, an, in, space, unfolded, structure, with, the, apollo, command, and, service, module, docking, while, never, realized, the, apollo, command, and, service, module, would, perform, docking, maneuvers, and, eventually, become, a, lunar, orbiting, module, which, was, used, for, station, like, purposes, but, before, that, the, gemini, program, paved, the, way, and, achieved, the, first, space, rendezvous, undocked, with, gemini, 6, and, gemini, 7, in, 1965, subsequently, in, 1966, neil, armstrong, performed, on, gemini, 8, the, first, ever, space, docking, while, in, 1967, kosmos, 186, and, kosmos, 188, were, the, first, spacecrafts, that, docked, automatically, in, january, 1969, soyuz, 4, and, soyuz, 5, performed, the, first, docked, but, not, internal, crew, transfer, and, finally, in, march, apollo, 9, performed, the, first, ever, internal, transfer, of, astronauts, between, two, docked, spaceships, in, 1971, the, soviet, union, developed, and, launched, the, world, s, first, space, station, salyut, 1, the, almaz, and, salyut, series, were, eventually, joined, by, skylab, mir, and, tiangong, 1, and, tiangong, 2, the, hardware, developed, during, the, initial, soviet, efforts, remains, in, use, with, evolved, variants, comprising, a, considerable, part, of, the, iss, orbiting, today, each, crew, member, stays, aboard, the, station, for, weeks, or, months, but, rarely, more, than, a, year, early, stations, were, monolithic, designs, that, were, constructed, and, launched, in, one, piece, generally, containing, all, their, supplies, and, experimental, equipment, a, crew, would, then, be, launched, to, join, the, station, and, perform, research, after, the, supplies, had, been, consumed, the, station, was, abandoned, the, first, space, station, was, salyut, 1, which, was, launched, by, the, soviet, union, on, april, 19, 1971, the, early, soviet, stations, were, all, designated, salyut, but, among, these, there, were, two, distinct, types, civilian, and, military, the, military, stations, salyut, 2, salyut, 3, and, salyut, 5, were, also, known, as, almaz, stations, the, civilian, stations, salyut, 6, and, salyut, 7, were, built, with, two, docking, ports, which, allowed, a, second, crew, to, visit, bringing, a, new, spacecraft, with, them, the, soyuz, ferry, could, spend, 90, days, in, space, at, which, point, it, needed, to, be, replaced, by, a, fresh, soyuz, spacecraft, this, allowed, for, a, crew, to, man, the, station, continually, the, american, skylab, 1973, 1979, was, also, equipped, with, two, docking, ports, like, second, generation, stations, but, the, extra, port, was, never, used, the, presence, of, a, second, port, on, the, new, stations, allowed, progress, supply, vehicles, to, be, docked, to, the, station, meaning, that, fresh, supplies, could, be, brought, to, aid, long, duration, missions, this, concept, was, expanded, on, salyut, 7, which, hard, docked, with, a, tks, tug, shortly, before, it, was, abandoned, this, served, as, a, proof, of, concept, for, the, use, of, modular, space, stations, the, later, salyuts, may, reasonably, be, seen, as, a, transition, between, the, two, groups, unlike, previous, stations, the, soviet, space, station, mir, had, a, modular, design, a, core, unit, was, launched, and, additional, modules, generally, with, a, specific, role, were, later, added, this, method, allows, for, greater, flexibility, in, operation, as, well, as, removing, the, need, for, a, single, immensely, powerful, launch, vehicle, modular, stations, are, also, designed, from, the, outset, to, have, their, supplies, provided, by, logistical, support, craft, which, allows, for, a, longer, lifetime, at, the, cost, of, requiring, regular, support, launches, the, iss, is, divided, into, two, main, sections, the, russian, orbital, segment, ros, and, the, us, orbital, segment, usos, the, first, module, of, the, international, space, station, zarya, was, launched, in, 1998, the, russian, orbital, segment, s, second, generation, modules, were, able, to, launch, on, proton, fly, to, the, correct, orbit, and, dock, themselves, without, human, intervention, connections, are, automatically, made, for, power, data, gases, and, propellants, the, russian, autonomous, approach, allows, the, assembly, of, space, stations, prior, to, the, launch, of, crew, the, russian, second, generation, modules, are, able, to, be, reconfigured, to, suit, changing, needs, as, of, 2009, rkk, energia, was, considering, the, removal, and, reuse, of, some, modules, of, the, ros, on, the, orbital, piloted, assembly, and, experiment, complex, after, the, end, of, mission, is, reached, for, the, iss, however, in, september, 2017, the, head, of, roscosmos, said, that, the, technical, feasibility, of, separating, the, station, to, form, opsek, had, been, studied, and, there, were, now, no, plans, to, separate, the, russian, segment, from, the, iss, in, contrast, the, main, us, modules, launched, on, the, space, shuttle, and, were, attached, to, the, iss, by, crews, during, evas, connections, for, electrical, power, data, propulsion, and, cooling, fluids, are, also, made, at, this, time, resulting, in, an, integrated, block, of, modules, that, is, not, designed, for, disassembly, and, must, be, deorbited, as, one, mass, the, axiom, orbital, segment, is, a, planned, commercial, segment, to, be, added, to, the, iss, starting, in, the, mid, 2020s, axiom, space, gained, nasa, approval, for, the, venture, in, january, 2020, up, to, three, axiom, modules, will, attach, to, the, international, space, station, the, first, module, hab, one, is, expected, to, be, launched, at, the, end, of, 2026, and, will, be, docked, to, the, forward, port, of, harmony, requiring, relocation, of, the, pma, 2, axiom, space, plans, to, attach, up, to, two, additional, modules, to, its, first, core, module, and, send, private, astronauts, to, inhabit, the, modules, the, modules, would, later, detach, into, the, axiom, station, in, a, manner, similar, to, russia, s, proposed, opsek, china, s, first, space, laboratory, tiangong, 1, was, launched, in, september, 2011, the, uncrewed, shenzhou, 8, then, successfully, performed, an, automatic, rendezvous, and, docking, in, november, 2011, the, crewed, shenzhou, 9, then, docked, with, tiangong, 1, in, june, 2012, followed, by, the, crewed, shenzhou, 10, in, 2013, according, to, the, china, manned, space, engineering, office, tiangong, 1, reentered, over, the, south, pacific, ocean, northwest, of, tahiti, on, 2, april, 2018, at, 00, 15, utc, a, second, space, laboratory, tiangong, 2, was, launched, in, september, 2016, while, a, plan, for, tiangong, 3, was, merged, with, tiangong, 2, the, station, made, a, controlled, reentry, on, 19, july, 2019, and, burned, up, over, the, south, pacific, ocean, the, tiangong, space, station, chinese, pinyin, ti, ng, ng, lit, heavenly, palace, the, first, module, of, which, was, launched, on, 29, april, 2021, is, in, low, earth, orbit, 340, to, 450, kilometres, above, the, earth, at, an, orbital, inclination, of, 42, to, 43, its, planned, construction, via, 11, total, launches, across, 2021, 2022, is, intended, to, extend, the, core, module, with, two, laboratory, modules, capable, of, hosting, up, to, six, crew, these, space, stations, have, been, announced, by, their, host, entity, and, are, currently, in, planning, development, or, production, the, launch, date, listed, here, may, change, as, more, information, becomes, available, 23, 548, cu, ft, 15892, cu, ft, while, originally, lockheed, martin, was, included, in, the, project, as, of, 2024, it, appears, their, primary, role, has, been, filled, by, airbus, to, provide, the, main, habitat, for, the, station, as, of, 2024, they, are, no, longer, listed, as, a, partner, on, starlab, s, website, 14, 126, cu, ft, 29, 000, cu, ft, two, types, of, space, stations, have, been, flown, monolithic, and, modular, monolithic, stations, consist, of, a, single, vehicle, and, are, launched, by, one, rocket, modular, stations, consist, of, two, or, more, separate, vehicles, that, are, launched, independently, and, docked, on, orbit, modular, stations, are, currently, preferred, due, to, lower, costs, and, greater, flexibility, a, space, station, is, a, complex, vehicle, that, must, incorporate, many, interrelated, subsystems, including, structure, electrical, power, thermal, control, attitude, determination, and, control, orbital, navigation, and, propulsion, automation, and, robotics, computing, and, communications, environmental, and, life, support, crew, facilities, and, crew, and, cargo, transportation, stations, must, serve, a, useful, role, which, drives, the, capabilities, required, space, stations, are, made, from, durable, materials, that, have, to, weather, space, radiation, internal, pressure, micrometeoroids, thermal, effects, of, the, sun, and, cold, temperatures, for, very, long, periods, of, time, they, are, typically, made, from, stainless, steel, titanium, and, high, quality, aluminum, alloys, with, layers, of, insulation, such, as, kevlar, as, a, ballistics, shield, protection, the, international, space, station, has, a, single, inflatable, module, the, bigelow, expandable, activity, module, which, was, installed, in, april, 2016, after, being, delivered, to, the, iss, on, the, spacex, crs, 8, resupply, mission, this, module, based, on, nasa, research, in, the, 1990s, weighed, 1, 400, kilograms, 3, 100, lb, and, was, transported, while, compressed, before, being, attached, to, the, iss, by, the, space, station, arm, and, inflated, to, provide, a, 16, cubic, metres, 21, cu, yd, volume, whilst, it, was, initially, designed, for, a, 2, year, lifetime, it, was, still, attached, and, being, used, for, storage, in, august, 2022, the, space, station, environment, presents, a, variety, of, challenges, to, human, habitability, including, short, term, problems, such, as, the, limited, supplies, of, air, water, and, food, and, the, need, to, manage, waste, heat, and, long, term, ones, such, as, weightlessness, and, relatively, high, levels, of, ionizing, radiation, these, conditions, can, create, long, term, health, problems, for, space, station, inhabitants, including, muscle, atrophy, bone, deterioration, balance, disorders, eyesight, disorders, and, elevated, risk, of, cancer, future, space, habitats, may, attempt, to, address, these, issues, and, could, be, designed, for, occupation, beyond, the, weeks, or, months, that, current, missions, typically, last, possible, solutions, include, the, creation, of, artificial, gravity, by, a, rotating, structure, the, inclusion, of, radiation, shielding, and, the, development, of, on, site, agricultural, ecosystems, some, designs, might, even, accommodate, large, numbers, of, people, becoming, essentially, cities, in, space, where, people, would, reside, semi, permanently, molds, that, develop, aboard, space, stations, can, produce, acids, that, degrade, metal, glass, and, rubber, despite, an, expanding, array, of, molecular, approaches, for, detecting, microorganisms, rapid, and, robust, means, of, assessing, the, differential, viability, of, the, microbial, cells, as, a, function, of, phylogenetic, lineage, remain, elusive, like, uncrewed, spacecraft, close, to, the, sun, space, stations, in, the, inner, solar, system, generally, rely, on, solar, panels, to, obtain, power, space, station, air, and, water, is, brought, up, in, spacecraft, from, earth, before, being, recycled, supplemental, oxygen, can, be, supplied, by, a, solid, fuel, oxygen, generator, the, last, military, use, space, station, was, the, soviet, salyut, 5, which, was, launched, under, the, almaz, program, and, orbited, between, 1976, and, 1977, space, stations, have, harboured, so, far, the, only, long, duration, direct, human, presence, in, space, after, the, first, station, salyut, 1, 1971, and, its, tragic, soyuz, 11, crew, space, stations, have, been, operated, consecutively, since, skylab, 1973, 1974, having, allowed, a, progression, of, long, duration, direct, human, presence, in, space, long, duration, resident, crews, have, been, joined, by, visiting, crews, since, 1977, salyut, 6, and, stations, have, been, occupied, by, consecutive, crews, since, 1987, with, the, salyut, successor, mir, uninterrupted, occupation, of, stations, has, been, achieved, since, the, operational, transition, from, the, mir, to, the, iss, with, its, first, occupation, in, 2000, the, iss, has, hosted, the, highest, number, of, people, in, orbit, at, the, same, time, reaching, 13, for, the, first, time, during, the, eleven, day, docking, of, sts, 127, in, 2009, the, duration, record, for, a, single, spaceflight, is, 437, 75, days,
