or, estuary, ports, can, also, be, found, far, inland, such, as, hamburg, manchester, and, duluth, these, access, the, sea, via, rivers, or, canals, because, of, their, roles, as, ports, of, entry, for, immigrants, as, well, as, soldiers, in, wartime, many, port, cities, have, experienced, dramatic, multi, ethnic, and, multicultural, changes, throughout, their, histories, ports, are, extremely, important, to, the, global, economy, 70, of, global, merchandise, trade, by, value, passes, through, a, port, for, this, reason, ports, are, also, often, densely, populated, settlements, that, provide, the, labor, for, processing, and, handling, goods, and, related, services, for, the, ports, today, by, far, the, greatest, growth, in, port, development, is, in, asia, the, continent, with, some, of, the, world, s, largest, and, busiest, ports, such, as, singapore, and, the, chinese, ports, of, shanghai, and, ningbo, zhoushan, as, of, 2020, the, busiest, passenger, port, in, europe, is, the, port, of, helsinki, in, finland, nevertheless, countless, smaller, ports, do, exist, that, may, only, serve, their, local, tourism, or, fishing, industries, ports, can, have, a, wide, environmental, impact, on, local, ecologies, and, waterways, most, importantly, water, quality, which, can, be, caused, by, dredging, spills, and, other, pollution, ports, are, heavily, affected, by, changing, environmental, factors, caused, by, climate, change, as, most, port, infrastructure, is, extremely, vulnerable, to, sea, level, rise, and, coastal, flooding, internationally, global, ports, are, beginning, to, identify, ways, to, improve, coastal, management, practices, and, integrate, climate, change, adaptation, practices, into, their, construction, wherever, ancient, civilisations, engaged, in, maritime, trade, they, tended, to, develop, sea, ports, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, known, artificial, harbors, is, at, wadi, al, jarf, on, the, red, sea, along, with, the, finding, of, harbor, structures, ancient, anchors, have, also, been, found, other, ancient, ports, include, guangzhou, during, qin, dynasty, china, and, canopus, the, principal, egyptian, port, for, greek, trade, before, the, foundation, of, alexandria, in, ancient, greece, athens, port, of, piraeus, was, the, base, for, the, athenian, fleet, which, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, battle, of, salamis, against, the, persians, in, 480, bce, in, ancient, india, from, 3700, bce, lothal, was, a, prominent, city, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, located, in, the, bhal, region, of, the, modern, state, of, gujar, t, ostia, antica, was, the, port, of, ancient, rome, with, portus, established, by, claudius, and, enlarged, by, trajan, to, supplement, the, nearby, port, of, ostia, in, japan, during, the, edo, period, the, island, of, dejima, was, the, only, port, open, for, trade, with, europe, and, received, only, a, single, dutch, ship, per, year, whereas, osaka, was, the, largest, domestic, port, and, the, main, trade, hub, for, rice, post, classical, swahili, kingdoms, are, known, to, have, had, trade, port, islands, and, trade, routes, with, the, islamic, world, and, asia, they, were, described, by, greek, historians, as, metropolises, famous, african, trade, ports, such, as, mombasa, zanzibar, mogadishu, and, kilwa, were, known, to, chinese, sailors, such, as, zheng, he, and, medieval, islamic, historians, such, as, the, berber, islamic, voyager, abu, abdullah, ibn, battuta, many, of, these, ancient, sites, no, longer, exist, or, function, as, modern, ports, even, in, more, recent, times, ports, sometimes, fall, out, of, use, rye, east, sussex, was, an, important, english, port, in, the, middle, ages, but, the, coastline, changed, and, it, is, now, 2, miles, 3, 2, km, from, the, sea, while, the, ports, of, ravenspurn, and, dunwich, have, been, lost, to, coastal, erosion, whereas, early, ports, tended, to, be, just, simple, harbours, modern, ports, tend, to, be, multimodal, distribution, hubs, with, transport, links, using, sea, river, canal, road, rail, and, air, routes, successful, ports, are, located, to, optimize, access, to, an, active, hinterland, such, as, the, london, gateway, ideally, a, port, will, grant, easy, navigation, to, ships, and, will, give, shelter, from, wind, and, waves, ports, are, often, on, estuaries, where, the, water, may, be, shallow, and, may, need, regular, dredging, deep, water, ports, such, as, milford, haven, are, less, common, but, can, handle, larger, ships, with, a, greater, draft, such, as, super, tankers, post, panamax, vessels, and, large, container, ships, other, businesses, such, as, regional, distribution, centres, warehouses, and, freight, forwarders, canneries, and, other, processing, facilities, find, it, advantageous, to, be, located, within, a, port, or, nearby, modern, ports, will, have, specialised, cargo, handling, equipment, such, as, gantry, cranes, reach, stackers, and, forklift, trucks, ports, usually, have, specialised, functions, some, tend, to, cater, mainly, for, passenger, ferries, and, cruise, ships, some, specialise, in, container, traffic, or, general, cargo, and, some, ports, play, an, important, military, role, for, their, nation, s, navy, some, third, world, countries, and, small, islands, such, as, ascension, and, st, helena, still, have, limited, port, facilities, so, that, ships, must, anchor, off, while, their, cargo, and, passengers, are, taken, ashore, by, barge, or, launch, respectively, in, modern, times, ports, survive, or, decline, depending, on, current, economic, trends, in, the, uk, both, the, ports, of, liverpool, and, southampton, were, once, significant, in, the, transatlantic, passenger, liner, business, once, airliner, traffic, decimated, that, trade, both, ports, diversified, to, container, cargo, and, cruise, ships, up, until, the, 1950s, the, port, of, london, was, a, major, international, port, on, the, river, thames, but, changes, in, shipping, and, the, use, of, containers, and, larger, ships, have, led, to, its, decline, thamesport, a, small, semi, automated, container, port, with, links, to, the, port, of, felixstowe, the, uk, s, largest, container, port, thrived, for, some, years, but, has, been, hit, hard, by, competition, from, the, emergent, london, gateway, port, and, logistics, hub, in, mainland, europe, it, is, normal, for, ports, to, be, publicly, owned, so, that, for, instance, the, ports, of, rotterdam, and, amsterdam, are, owned, partly, by, the, state, and, partly, by, the, cities, themselves, even, though, modern, ships, tend, to, have, bow, thrusters, and, stern, thrusters, many, port, authorities, still, require, vessels, to, use, pilots, and, tugboats, for, manoeuvering, large, ships, in, tight, quarters, for, instance, ships, approaching, the, belgian, port, of, antwerp, an, inland, port, on, the, river, scheldt, are, obliged, to, use, dutch, pilots, when, navigating, on, that, part, of, the, estuary, that, belongs, to, the, netherlands, ports, with, international, traffic, have, customs, facilities, the, terms, port, and, seaport, are, used, for, different, types, of, facilities, handling, ocean, going, vessels, and, river, port, is, used, for, river, traffic, such, as, barges, and, other, shallow, draft, vessels, an, inland, port, is, a, port, on, a, navigable, lake, river, fluvial, port, or, canal, with, access, to, a, sea, or, ocean, which, therefore, allows, a, ship, to, sail, from, the, ocean, inland, to, the, port, to, load, or, unload, its, cargo, an, example, of, this, is, the, st, lawrence, seaway, which, allows, ships, to, travel, from, the, atlantic, ocean, several, thousand, kilometers, inland, to, great, lakes, ports, like, toronto, duluth, superior, and, chicago, the, term, inland, port, is, also, used, for, dry, ports, a, seaport, is, a, port, located, on, the, shore, of, a, sea, or, ocean, it, is, further, categorized, as, commercial, and, non, commercial, cargo, ports, are, quite, different, from, cruise, ports, because, each, handles, very, different, cargo, which, has, to, be, loaded, and, unloaded, by, a, variety, of, mechanical, means, bulk, cargo, ports, may, handle, one, particular, type, of, cargo, or, numerous, cargoes, such, as, grains, liquid, fuels, liquid, chemicals, wood, automobiles, etc, such, ports, are, known, as, the, bulk, or, break, bulk, ports, ports, that, handle, containerized, cargo, are, known, as, container, ports, most, cargo, ports, handle, all, sorts, of, cargo, but, some, ports, are, very, specific, as, to, what, cargo, they, handle, additionally, individual, cargo, ports, may, be, divided, into, different, operating, terminals, which, handle, the, different, types, of, cargoes, and, may, be, operated, by, different, companies, also, known, as, terminal, operators, or, stevedores, a, cruise, home, port, is, the, port, where, cruise, ship, passengers, board, or, embark, to, start, their, cruise, and, disembark, the, cruise, ship, at, the, end, of, their, cruise, it, is, also, where, the, cruise, ship, s, supplies, are, loaded, for, the, cruise, which, includes, everything, from, fresh, water, and, fuel, to, fruits, vegetables, champagne, and, any, other, supplies, needed, for, the, cruise, cruise, home, ports, are, very, busy, places, during, the, day, the, cruise, ship, is, in, port, because, off, going, passengers, debark, their, baggage, and, on, coming, passengers, board, the, ship, in, addition, to, all, the, supplies, being, loaded, cruise, home, ports, tend, to, have, large, passenger, terminals, to, handle, the, large, number, of, passengers, passing, through, the, port, the, busiest, cruise, home, port, in, the, world, is, the, port, of, miami, florida, a, port, of, call, is, an, intermediate, stop, for, a, ship, on, its, sailing, itinerary, at, these, ports, cargo, ships, may, take, on, supplies, or, fuel, as, well, as, unloading, and, loading, cargo, while, cruise, liners, have, passengers, get, on, or, off, ship, a, fishing, port, is, a, port, or, harbor, for, landing, and, distributing, fish, it, may, be, a, recreational, facility, but, it, is, usually, commercial, a, fishing, port, is, the, only, port, that, depends, on, an, ocean, product, and, depletion, of, fish, may, cause, a, fishing, port, to, be, uneconomical, a, marina, is, a, port, for, recreational, boating, a, warm, water, port, also, known, as, an, ice, free, port, is, one, where, the, water, does, not, freeze, in, winter, this, is, mainly, used, in, the, context, of, countries, with, mostly, cold, winters, where, parts, of, the, coastline, freezes, over, every, winter, because, they, are, available, year, round, warm, water, ports, can, be, of, great, geopolitical, or, economic, interest, such, settlements, as, narvik, in, norway, dalian, in, china, murmansk, novorossiysk, petropavlovsk, kamchatsky, and, vostochny, port, in, russia, odesa, in, ukraine, kushiro, in, japan, and, valdez, at, the, terminus, of, the, alaska, pipeline, owe, their, very, existence, to, being, ice, free, ports, the, baltic, sea, and, similar, areas, have, ports, available, year, round, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, thanks, to, icebreakers, but, earlier, access, problems, prompted, russia, to, expand, its, territory, to, the, black, sea, a, dry, port, is, an, inland, intermodal, terminal, directly, connected, by, road, or, rail, to, a, seaport, and, operating, as, a, centre, for, the, transshipment, of, sea, cargo, to, inland, destinations, a, smart, port, uses, technologies, including, the, internet, of, things, iot, and, artificial, intelligence, ai, to, be, more, efficient, at, handling, goods, smart, ports, usually, deploy, cloud, based, software, as, part, of, the, process, of, greater, automation, to, help, generate, the, operating, flow, that, helps, the, port, work, smoothly, at, present, most, of, the, world, s, ports, have, somewhat, embedded, technology, if, not, for, full, leadership, however, thanks, to, global, government, initiatives, and, exponential, growth, in, maritime, trade, the, number, of, intelligent, ports, has, gradually, increased, a, report, by, business, intelligence, provider, visiongain, assessed, that, smart, ports, market, spending, would, reach, 1, 5, bn, in, 2019, ports, and, their, operation, are, often, a, cause, of, environmental, issues, such, as, sediment, contamination, and, spills, from, ships, and, are, susceptible, to, larger, environmental, issues, such, as, human, caused, climate, change, and, its, effects, every, year, 100, million, cubic, metres, of, marine, sediment, are, dredged, to, improve, waterways, around, ports, dredging, in, its, practice, disturbs, local, ecosystems, brings, sediments, into, the, water, column, and, can, stir, up, pollutants, captured, in, the, sediments, invasive, species, are, often, spread, by, the, bilge, water, and, species, attached, to, the, hulls, of, ships, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, over, 7000, invasive, species, transported, in, bilge, water, around, the, world, on, a, daily, basis, invasive, species, can, have, direct, or, indirect, interactions, with, native, sea, life, direct, interaction, such, as, predation, is, when, a, native, species, with, no, natural, predator, is, all, of, a, sudden, prey, of, an, invasive, specie, indirect, interaction, can, be, diseases, or, other, health, conditions, brought, by, invasive, species, ports, are, also, a, source, of, increased, air, pollution, as, a, result, of, ships, and, land, transportation, at, the, port, transportation, corridors, around, ports, have, higher, exhaust, emissions, and, this, can, have, related, health, effects, on, local, communities, water, quality, around, ports, is, often, lower, because, of, both, direct, and, indirect, pollution, from, the, shipping, and, other, challenges, caused, by, the, port, s, community, such, as, trash, washing, into, the, ocean, sewage, from, ships, and, leaks, of, oil, and, chemicals, from, shipping, vessels, can, contaminate, local, water, and, cause, other, effects, like, nutrient, pollution, in, the, water, ports, and, their, infrastructure, are, very, vulnerable, to, climate, change, and, sea, level, rise, because, many, of, them, are, in, low, lying, areas, designed, for, status, quo, water, levels, variable, weather, coastal, erosion, and, sea, level, rise, all, put, pressure, on, existing, infrastructure, resulting, in, subsidence, coastal, flooding, and, other, direct, pressures, on, the, port, there, are, several, initiatives, to, decrease, negative, environmental, impacts, of, ports, the, world, port, sustainability, program, points, to, all, of, the, sustainable, development, goals, as, potential, ways, of, addressing, port, sustainability, these, include, simpyc, the, world, ports, climate,
