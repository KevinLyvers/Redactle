the, european, space, agency, esa, is, a, 22, member, intergovernmental, body, devoted, to, space, exploration, with, its, headquarters, in, paris, and, a, staff, of, around, 2, 547, people, globally, as, of, 2023, esa, was, founded, in, 1975, its, 2024, annual, budget, was, 7, 8, billion, esa, s, space, flight, programme, includes, human, spaceflight, mainly, through, participation, in, the, international, space, station, program, the, launch, and, operation, of, crewless, exploration, missions, to, other, planets, such, as, mars, and, the, moon, earth, observation, science, and, telecommunication, designing, launch, vehicles, and, maintaining, a, major, spaceport, the, guiana, space, centre, at, kourou, french, guiana, france, the, main, european, launch, vehicle, ariane, 6, will, be, operated, through, arianespace, with, esa, sharing, in, the, costs, of, launching, and, further, developing, this, launch, vehicle, the, agency, is, also, working, with, nasa, to, manufacture, the, orion, spacecraft, service, module, that, flies, on, the, space, launch, system, after, world, war, ii, many, european, scientists, left, western, europe, in, order, to, work, with, the, united, states, although, the, 1950s, boom, made, it, possible, for, western, european, countries, to, invest, in, research, and, specifically, in, space, related, activities, western, european, scientists, realised, solely, national, projects, would, not, be, able, to, compete, with, the, two, main, superpowers, in, 1958, only, months, after, the, sputnik, shock, edoardo, amaldi, italy, and, pierre, auger, france, two, prominent, members, of, the, western, european, scientific, community, met, to, discuss, the, foundation, of, a, common, western, european, space, agency, the, meeting, was, attended, by, scientific, representatives, from, eight, countries, the, western, european, nations, decided, to, have, two, agencies, one, concerned, with, developing, a, launch, system, eldo, european, launcher, development, organisation, and, the, other, the, precursor, of, the, european, space, agency, esro, european, space, research, organisation, the, latter, was, established, on, 20, march, 1964, by, an, agreement, signed, on, 14, june, 1962, from, 1968, to, 1972, esro, launched, seven, research, satellites, but, eldo, was, not, able, to, deliver, a, launch, vehicle, both, agencies, struggled, with, the, underfunding, and, diverging, interests, of, their, participants, esa, in, its, current, form, was, founded, with, the, esa, convention, in, 1975, when, esro, was, merged, with, eldo, esa, had, ten, founding, member, states, belgium, denmark, france, west, germany, italy, the, netherlands, spain, sweden, switzerland, and, the, united, kingdom, these, signed, the, esa, convention, in, 1975, and, deposited, the, instruments, of, ratification, by, 1980, when, the, convention, came, into, force, during, this, interval, the, agency, functioned, in, a, de, facto, fashion, esa, launched, its, first, major, scientific, mission, in, 1975, cos, b, a, space, probe, monitoring, gamma, ray, emissions, in, the, universe, which, was, first, worked, on, by, esro, esa, collaborated, with, nasa, on, the, international, ultraviolet, explorer, iue, the, world, s, first, high, orbit, telescope, which, was, launched, in, 1978, and, operated, successfully, for, 18, years, a, number, of, successful, earth, orbit, projects, followed, and, in, 1986, esa, began, giotto, its, first, deep, space, mission, to, study, the, comets, halley, and, grigg, skjellerup, hipparcos, a, star, mapping, mission, was, launched, in, 1989, and, in, the, 1990s, soho, ulysses, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, were, all, jointly, carried, out, with, nasa, later, scientific, missions, in, cooperation, with, nasa, include, the, cassini, huygens, space, probe, to, which, esa, contributed, by, building, the, titan, landing, module, huygens, as, the, successor, of, eldo, esa, has, also, constructed, rockets, for, scientific, and, commercial, payloads, ariane, 1, launched, in, 1979, carried, mostly, commercial, payloads, into, orbit, from, 1984, onward, the, next, two, versions, of, the, ariane, rocket, were, intermediate, stages, in, the, development, of, a, more, advanced, launch, system, the, ariane, 4, which, operated, between, 1988, and, 2003, and, established, esa, as, the, world, leader, in, commercial, space, launches, in, the, 1990s, although, the, succeeding, ariane, 5, experienced, a, failure, on, its, first, flight, it, has, since, firmly, established, itself, within, the, heavily, competitive, commercial, space, launch, market, with, 112, successful, launches, until, 2021, the, successor, launch, vehicle, the, ariane, 6, is, under, development, and, had, a, successful, long, firing, engine, test, in, november, 2023, the, esa, plans, for, the, ariane, 6, to, launch, in, june, or, july, 2024, the, beginning, of, the, new, millennium, saw, esa, become, along, with, agencies, like, nasa, jaxa, isro, the, csa, and, roscosmos, one, of, the, major, participants, in, scientific, space, research, although, esa, had, relied, on, co, operation, with, nasa, in, previous, decades, especially, the, 1990s, changed, circumstances, such, as, tough, legal, restrictions, on, information, sharing, by, the, united, states, military, led, to, decisions, to, rely, more, on, itself, and, on, co, operation, with, russia, a, 2011, press, issue, thus, stated, russia, is, esa, s, first, partner, in, its, efforts, to, ensure, long, term, access, to, space, there, is, a, framework, agreement, between, esa, and, the, government, of, the, russian, federation, on, cooperation, and, partnership, in, the, exploration, and, use, of, outer, space, for, peaceful, purposes, and, cooperation, is, already, underway, in, two, different, areas, of, launcher, activity, that, will, bring, benefits, to, both, partners, notable, esa, programmes, include, smart, 1, a, probe, testing, cutting, edge, space, propulsion, technology, the, mars, express, and, venus, express, missions, as, well, as, the, development, of, the, ariane, 5, rocket, and, its, role, in, the, iss, partnership, esa, maintains, its, scientific, and, research, projects, mainly, for, astronomy, space, missions, such, as, corot, launched, on, 27, december, 2006, a, milestone, in, the, search, for, exoplanets, on, 21, january, 2019, arianegroup, and, arianespace, announced, a, one, year, contract, with, esa, to, study, and, prepare, for, a, mission, to, mine, the, moon, for, lunar, regolith, in, 2021, the, esa, ministerial, council, agreed, to, the, matosinhos, manifesto, which, set, three, priority, areas, referred, to, as, accelerators, space, for, a, green, future, a, rapid, and, resilient, crisis, response, and, the, protection, of, space, assets, and, two, further, high, visibility, projects, referred, to, as, inspirators, an, icy, moon, sample, return, mission, and, human, space, exploration, in, the, same, year, the, recruitment, process, began, for, the, 2022, european, space, agency, astronaut, group, 1, july, 2023, saw, the, launch, of, the, euclid, spacecraft, developed, jointly, with, the, euclid, consortium, after, 10, years, of, planning, and, building, it, is, designed, to, better, understand, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, by, accurately, measuring, the, accelerating, expansion, of, the, universe, the, agency, s, facilities, date, back, to, esro, and, are, deliberately, distributed, among, various, countries, and, areas, the, most, important, are, the, following, centres, the, treaty, establishing, the, european, space, agency, reads, the, purpose, of, the, agency, shall, be, to, provide, for, and, to, promote, for, exclusively, peaceful, purposes, cooperation, among, european, states, in, space, research, and, technology, and, their, space, applications, with, a, view, to, their, being, used, for, scientific, purposes, and, for, operational, space, applications, systems, esa, is, responsible, for, setting, a, unified, space, and, related, industrial, policy, recommending, space, objectives, to, the, member, states, and, integrating, national, programs, like, satellite, development, into, the, european, program, as, much, as, possible, jean, jacques, dordain, esa, s, director, general, 2003, 2015, outlined, the, european, space, agency, s, mission, in, a, 2003, interview, today, space, activities, have, pursued, the, benefit, of, citizens, and, citizens, are, asking, for, a, better, quality, of, life, on, earth, they, want, greater, security, and, economic, wealth, but, they, also, want, to, pursue, their, dreams, to, increase, their, knowledge, and, they, want, younger, people, to, be, attracted, to, the, pursuit, of, science, and, technology, i, think, that, space, can, do, all, of, this, it, can, produce, a, higher, quality, of, life, better, security, more, economic, wealth, and, also, fulfill, our, citizens, dreams, and, thirst, for, knowledge, and, attract, the, young, generation, this, is, the, reason, space, exploration, is, an, integral, part, of, overall, space, activities, it, has, always, been, so, and, it, will, be, even, more, important, in, the, future, esa, describes, its, work, in, two, overlapping, ways, these, are, either, mandatory, or, optional, according, to, the, esa, website, the, activities, are, every, member, country, known, as, member, states, must, contribute, to, these, programmes, the, european, space, agency, science, programme, is, a, long, term, programme, of, space, science, missions, depending, on, their, individual, choices, the, countries, can, contribute, to, the, following, programmes, becoming, participating, states, listed, according, to, as, of, 2023, esa, employs, around, 2, 547, people, and, thousands, of, contractors, initially, new, employees, are, contracted, for, an, expandable, four, year, term, which, is, until, the, organization, s, retirement, age, of, 63, according, to, esa, s, documents, the, staff, can, receive, myriad, of, perks, such, as, financial, childcare, support, retirement, plans, and, financial, help, when, migrating, esa, also, allows, employees, prevent, any, private, documents, or, correspondences, from, disclosure, to, outside, parties, ars, technica, s, 2023, report, which, contained, testimonies, of, 18, people, suggested, that, there, is, a, widespread, harassment, between, management, and, its, employees, especially, with, its, contractors, since, esa, is, an, international, organization, unaffiliated, with, any, single, nation, any, form, of, legal, action, is, difficult, to, raise, against, the, organization, member, states, participate, to, varying, degrees, with, both, mandatory, space, programs, and, those, that, are, optional, as, of, 2008, the, mandatory, programmes, made, up, 25, of, total, expenditures, while, optional, space, programmes, were, the, other, 75, the, european, space, agency, has, traditionally, implemented, a, policy, of, georeturn, where, funds, that, esa, member, states, provide, to, the, esa, are, returned, in, the, form, of, contracts, to, companies, in, those, countries, by, 2015, esa, was, an, intergovernmental, organisation, of, 22, member, states, the, 2008, esa, budget, amounted, to, 3, 0, billion, whilst, the, 2009, budget, amounted, to, 3, 6, billion, the, total, budget, amounted, to, about, 3, 7, billion, in, 2010, 3, 99, billion, in, 2011, 4, 02, billion, in,

additionally, official, documents, are, also, provided, in, german, and, documents, regarding, the, spacelab, have, been, also, provided, in, italian, if, found, appropriate, the, agency, may, conduct, its, correspondence, in, any, language, of, a, member, state, the, following, table, lists, all, the, member, states, and, adjunct, members, their, esa, convention, ratification, dates, and, their, contributions, as, of, 2024, previously, associated, members, were, austria, norway, and, finland, all, of, which, later, joined, esa, as, full, members, since, october, 2022, there, have, been, five, associate, members, slovenia, latvia, lithuania, slovakia, and, canada, the, four, european, members, have, shown, interest, in, full, membership, and, may, eventually, apply, within, the, next, years, since, 2016, slovenia, has, been, an, associated, member, of, the, esa, in, november, 2023, slovenia, formally, applied, for, full, membership, in, june, 2024, prime, minister, robert, golob, and, director, general, josef, aschbacher, have, signed, an, agreement, that, will, see, slovenia, become, a, full, member, of, esa, on, 1, january, 2025, when, the, current, association, agreement, expires, latvia, became, the, second, current, associated, member, on, 30, june, 2020, when, the, association, agreement, was, signed, by, esa, director, jan, w, rner, and, the, minister, of, education, and, science, of, latvia, ilga, uplinska, in, riga, the, saeima, ratified, it, on, 27, july, in, may, 2021, lithuania, became, the, third, current, associated, member, as, a, consequence, its, citizens, became, eligible, to, apply, to, the, 2022, esa, astronaut, group, applications, for, which, were, scheduled, to, close, one, week, later, the, deadline, was, therefore, extended, by, three, weeks, to, allow, lithuanians, a, fair, chance, to, apply, slovakia, s, associate, membership, came, into, effect, on, 13, october, 2022, for, an, initial, duration, of, seven, years, the, association, agreement, supersedes, the, european, cooperating, state, ecs, agreement, which, entered, into, force, upon, slovakia, s, subscription, to, the, plan, for, european, cooperating, states, charter, on, 4, february, 2016, a, scheme, introduced, at, esa, in, 2001, the, ecs, agreement, was, subsequently, extended, until, 3, august, 2022, since, 1, january, 1979, canada, has, had, the, special, status, of, a, cooperating, state, within, esa, by, virtue, of, this, accord, the, canadian, space, agency, takes, part, in, esa, s, deliberative, bodies, and, decision, making, and, also, in, esa, s, programmes, and, activities, canadian, firms, can, bid, for, and, receive, contracts, to, work, on, programmes, the, accord, has, a, provision, ensuring, a, fair, industrial, return, to, canada, the, most, recent, cooperation, agreement, was, signed, on, 15, december, 2010, with, a, term, extending, to, 2020, for, 2014, canada, s, annual, assessed, contribution, to, the, esa, general, budget, was, 6, 059, 449, cad, 8, 559, 050, for, 2017, canada, has, increased, its, annual, contribution, to, 21, 600, 000, cad, 30, 000, 000, esa, is, funded, from, annual, contributions, by, national, governments, of, members, as, well, as, from, an, annual, contribution, by, the, european, union, eu, the, budget, of, esa, was, 5, 250, billion, in, 2016, every, 3, 4, years, esa, member, states, agree, on, a, budget, plan, for, several, years, at, an, esa, member, states, conference, this, plan, can, be, amended, in, future, years, however, provides, the, major, guideline, for, esa, for, several, years, the, 2016, budget, allocations, for, major, areas, of, esa, activity, are, shown, in, the, chart, on, the, right, countries, typically, have, their, own, space, programmes, that, differ, in, how, they, operate, organisationally, and, financially, with, esa, for, example, the, french, space, agency, cnes, has, a, total, budget, of, 2015, million, of, which, 755, million, is, paid, as, direct, financial, contribution, to, esa, several, space, related, projects, are, joint, projects, between, national, space, agencies, and, esa, e, g, corot, also, esa, is, not, the, only, european, governmental, space, organisation, for, example, european, union, satellite, centre, and, the, european, union, space, programme, agency, after, the, decision, of, the, esa, council, of, 21, 22, march, 2001, the, procedure, for, accession, of, the, european, states, was, detailed, as, described, the, document, titled, the, plan, for, european, co, operating, states, pecs, nations, that, want, to, become, a, full, member, of, esa, do, so, in, 3, stages, first, a, cooperation, agreement, is, signed, between, the, country, and, esa, in, this, stage, the, country, has, very, limited, financial, responsibilities, if, a, country, wants, to, co, operate, more, fully, with, esa, it, signs, a, european, cooperating, state, ecs, agreement, albeit, to, be, a, candidate, for, said, agreement, a, country, must, be, european, the, ecs, agreement, makes, companies, based, in, the, country, eligible, for, participation, in, esa, procurements, the, country, can, also, participate, in, all, esa, programmes, except, for, the, basic, technology, research, programme, while, the, financial, contribution, of, the, country, concerned, increases, it, is, still, much, lower, than, that, of, a, full, member, state, the, agreement, is, normally, followed, by, a, plan, for, european, cooperating, state, or, pecs, charter, this, is, a, 5, year, programme, of, basic, research, and, development, activities, aimed, at, improving, the, nation, s, space, industry, capacity, at, the, end, of, the, 5, year, period, the, country, can, either, begin, negotiations, to, become, a, full, member, state, or, an, associated, state, or, sign, a, new, pecs, charter, many, countries, most, of, which, joined, the, eu, in, both, 2004, and, 2007, have, started, to, co, operate, with, esa, on, various, levels, during, the, ministerial, meeting, in, december, 2014, esa, ministers, approved, a, resolution, calling, for, discussions, to, begin, with, israel, australia, and, south, africa, on, future, association, agreements, the, ministers, noted, that, concrete, cooperation, is, at, an, advanced, stage, with, these, nations, and, that, prospects, for, mutual, benefits, are, existing, a, separate, space, exploration, strategy, resolution, calls, for, further, co, operation, with, the, united, states, russia, and, china, on, leo, exploration, including, a, continuation, of, iss, cooperation, and, the, development, of, a, robust, plan, for, the, coordinated, use, of, space, transportation, vehicles, and, systems, for, exploration, purposes, participation, in, robotic, missions, for, the, exploration, of, the, moon, the, robotic, exploration, of, mars, leading, to, a, broad, mars, sample, return, mission, in, which, europe, should, be, involved, as, a, full, partner, and, human, missions, beyond, leo, in, the, longer, term, in, august, 2019, esa, and, the, australian, space, agency, signed, a, joint, statement, of, intent, to, explore, deeper, cooperation, and, identify, projects, in, a, range, of, areas, including, deep, space, communications, navigation, remote, asset, management, data, analytics, and, mission, support, details, of, the, cooperation, were, laid, out, in, a, framework, agreement, signed, by, the, two, entities, on, 17, november, 2020, esa, signed, a, memorandum, of, understanding, mou, with, the, south, african, national, space, agency, sansa, sansa, ceo, dr, valanathan, munsami, tweeted, today, saw, another, landmark, event, for, sansa, with, the, signing, of, an, mou, with, esa, this, builds, on, initiatives, that, we, have, been, discussing, for, a, while, already, and, which, gives, effect, to, these, thanks, jan, for, your, hand, of, friendship, and, making, this, possible, the, esa, currently, has, two, operational, launch, vehicles, vega, c, and, ariane, 6, rocket, launches, are, carried, out, by, arianespace, which, has, 23, shareholders, representing, the, industry, that, manufactures, the, ariane, 5, as, well, as, cnes, at, the, esa, s, guiana, space, centre, because, many, communication, satellites, have, equatorial, orbits, launches, from, french, guiana, are, able, to, take, larger, payloads, into, space, than, from, spaceports, at, higher, latitudes, in, addition, equatorial, launches, give, spacecraft, an, extra, push, of, nearly, 500, m, s, due, to, the, higher, rotational, velocity, of, the, earth, at, the, equator, compared, to, near, the, earth, s, poles, where, rotational, velocity, approaches, zero, ariane, 6, is, a, heavy, lift, expendable, launch, vehicle, developed, by, arianespace, the, ariane, 6, entered, into, its, inaugural, flight, campaign, on, 26, april, 2024, with, the, flight, conducted, on, 9, july, 2024, vega, is, the, esa, s, carrier, for, small, satellites, developed, by, seven, esa, members, led, by, italy, it, is, capable, of, carrying, a, payload, with, a, mass, of, between, 300, and, 1500, kg, to, an, altitude, of, 700, km, for, low, polar, orbit, its, maiden, launch, from, kourou, was, on, 13, february, 2012, vega, began, full, commercial, exploitation, in, december, 2015, the, rocket, has, three, solid, propulsion, stages, and, a, liquid, propulsion, upper, stage, the, avum, for, accurate, orbital, insertion, and, the, ability, to, place, multiple, payloads, into, different, orbits, a, larger, version, of, the, vega, launcher, vega, c, had, its, first, flight, in, july, 2022, the, new, evolution, of, the, rocket, incorporates, a, larger, first, stage, booster, the, p120c, replacing, the, p80, an, upgraded, zefiro, rocket, stage, second, stage, and, the, avum, upper, stage, this, new, variant, enables, larger, single, payloads, dual, payloads, return, missions, and, orbital, transfer, capabilities, historically, the, ariane, family, rockets, have, been, funded, primarily, with, money, contributed, by, esa, governments, seeking, to, participate, in, the, program, rather, than, through, competitive, industry, bids, this, governments, commit, multiyear, funding, to, the, development, with, the, expectation, of, a, roughly, 90, return, on, investment, in, the, form, of, industrial, workshare, esa, is, proposing, changes, to, this, scheme, by, moving, to, competitive, bids, for, the, development, of, the, ariane, 6, future, projects, include, the, prometheus, reusable, engine, technology, demonstrator, phoebus, an, upgraded, second, stage, for, ariane, 6, and, themis, a, reusable, first, stage, at, the, time, esa, was, formed, its, main, goals, did, not, encompass, human, space, flight, rather, it, considered, itself, to, be, primarily, a, scientific, research, organisation, for, uncrewed, space, exploration, in, contrast, to, its, american, and, soviet, counterparts, it, is, therefore, not, surprising, that, the, first, non, soviet, european, in, space, was, not, an, esa, astronaut, on, a, european, space, craft, it, was, czechoslovak, vladim, r, remek, who, in, 1978, became, the, first, non, soviet, or, american, in, space, the, first, man, in, space, being, yuri, gagarin, of, the, soviet, union, on, a, soviet, soyuz, spacecraft, followed, by, the, pole, miros, aw, hermaszewski, and, east, german, sigmund, j, hn, in, the, same, year, this, soviet, co, operation, programme, known, as, intercosmos, primarily, involved, the, participation, of, eastern, bloc, countries, in, 1982, however, jean, loup, chr, tien, became, the, first, non, communist, bloc, astronaut, on, a, flight, to, the, soviet, salyut, 7, space, station, because, chr, tien, did, not, officially, fly, into, space, as, an, esa, astronaut, but, rather, as, a, member, of, the, french, cnes, astronaut, corps, the, german, ulf, merbold, is, considered, the, first, esa, astronaut, to, fly, into, space, he, participated, in, the, sts, 9, space, shuttle, mission, that, included, the, first, use, of, the, european, built, spacelab, in, 1983, sts, 9, marked, the, beginning, of, an, extensive, esa, nasa, joint, partnership, that, included, dozens, of, space, flights, of, esa, astronauts, in, the, following, years, some, of, these, missions, with, spacelab, were, fully, funded, and, organisationally, and, scientifically, controlled, by, esa, such, as, two, missions, by, germany, and, one, by, japan, with, european, astronauts, as, full, crew, members, rather, than, guests, on, board, beside, paying, for, spacelab, flights, and, seats, on, the, shuttles, esa, continued, its, human, space, flight, co, operation, with, the, soviet, union, and, later, russia, including, numerous, visits, to, mir, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 1980s, european, human, space, flights, changed, from, being, the, exception, to, routine, and, therefore, in, 1990, the, european, astronaut, centre, in, cologne, germany, was, established, it, selects, and, trains, prospective, astronauts, and, is, responsible, for, the, co, ordination, with, international, partners, especially, with, regard, to, the, international, space, station, as, of, 2006, the, esa, astronaut, corps, officially, included, twelve, members, including, nationals, from, most, large, european, countries, except, the, united, kingdom, in, 2008, esa, started, to, recruit, new, astronauts, so, that, final, selection, would, be, due, in, spring, 2009, almost, 10, 000, people, registered, as, astronaut, candidates, before, registration, ended, in, june, 2008, 8, 413, fulfilled, the, initial, application, criteria, of, the, applicants, 918, were, chosen, to, take, part, in, the, first, stage, of, psychological, testing, which, narrowed, down, the, field, to, 192, after, two, stage, psychological, tests, and, medical, evaluation, in, early, 2009, as, well, as, formal, interviews, six, new, members, of, the, european, astronaut, corps, were, selected, five, men, and, one, woman, in, the, 1980s, france, pressed, for, an, independent, european, crew, launch, vehicle, around, 1978, it, was, decided, to, pursue, a, reusable, spacecraft, model, and, starting, in, november, 1987, a, project, to, create, a, mini, shuttle, by, the, name, of, hermes, was, introduced, the, craft, was, comparable, to, early, proposals, for, the, space, shuttle, and, consisted, of, a, small, reusable, spaceship, that, would, carry, 3, to, 5, astronauts, and, 3, to, 4, metric, tons, of, payload, for, scientific, experiments, with, a, total, maximum, weight, of, 21, metric, tons, it, would, have, been, launched, on, the, ariane, 5, rocket, which, was, being, developed, at, that, time, it, was, planned, solely, for, use, in, low, earth, orbit, space, flights, the, planning, and, pre, development, phase, concluded, in, 1991, the, production, phase, was, never, fully, implemented, because, at, that, time, the, political, landscape, had, changed, significantly, with, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, esa, looked, forward, to, co, operation, with, russia, to, build, a, next, generation, space, vehicle, thus, the, hermes, programme, was, cancelled, in, 1995, after, about, 3, billion, dollars, had, been, spent, the, columbus, space, station, programme, had, a, similar, fate, in, the, 21st, century, esa, started, new, programmes, in, order, to, create, its, own, crew, vehicles, most, notable, among, its, various, projects, and, proposals, is, hopper, whose, prototype, by, eads, called, phoenix, has, already, been, tested, while, projects, such, as, hopper, are, neither, concrete, nor, to, be, realised, within, the, next, decade, other, possibilities, for, human, spaceflight, in, co, operation, with, the, russian, space, agency, have, emerged, following, talks, with, the, russian, space, agency, in, 2004, and, june, 2005, a, co, operation, between, esa, and, the, russian, space, agency, was, announced, to, jointly, work, on, the, russian, designed, kliper, a, reusable, spacecraft, that, would, be, available, for, space, travel, beyond, leo, e, g, the, moon, or, even, mars, it, was, speculated, that, europe, would, finance, part, of, it, a, 50, million, participation, study, for, kliper, which, was, expected, to, be, approved, in, december, 2005, was, finally, not, approved, by, the, esa, member, states, the, russian, state, tender, for, the, project, was, subsequently, cancelled, in, 2006, in, june, 2006, esa, member, states, granted, 15, million, to, the, crew, space, transportation, system, csts, study, a, two, year, study, to, design, a, spacecraft, capable, of, going, beyond, low, earth, orbit, based, on, the, current, soyuz, design, this, project, was, pursued, with, roskosmos, instead, of, the, cancelled, kliper, proposal, a, decision, on, the, actual, implementation, and, construction, of, the, csts, spacecraft, was, contemplated, for, 2008, in, mid, 2009, eads, astrium, was, awarded, a, 21, million, study, into, designing, a, crew, vehicle, based, on, the, european, atv, which, is, believed, to, now, be, the, basis, of, the, advanced, crew, transportation, system, design, in, november, 2012, esa, decided, to, join, nasa, s, orion, programme, the, atv, would, form, the, basis, of, a, propulsion, unit, for, nasa, s, new, crewed, spacecraft, esa, may, also, seek, to, work, with, nasa, on, orion, s, launch, system, as, well, in, order, to, secure, a, seat, on, the, spacecraft, for, its, own, astronauts, in, september, 2014, esa, signed, an, agreement, with, sierra, nevada, corporation, for, co, operation, in, dream, chaser, project, further, studies, on, the, dream, chaser, for, european, utilization, or, dc4eu, project, were, funded, including, the, feasibility, of, launching, a, europeanised, dream, chaser, onboard, ariane, 5, esa, has, signed, co, operation, agreements, with, the, following, states, that, currently, neither, plan, to, integrate, as, tightly, with, esa, institutions, as, canada, nor, envision, future, membership, of, esa, argentina, brazil, china, india, for, the, chandrayan, mission, russia, and, turkey, additionally, esa, has, joint, projects, with, the, euspa, of, the, european, union, nasa, of, the, united, states, and, is, participating, in, the, international, space, station, together, with, the, united, states, nasa, russia, and, japan, jaxa, esa, has, a, long, history, of, collaboration, with, nasa, since, esa, s, astronaut, corps, was, formed, the, space, shuttle, has, been, the, primary, launch, vehicle, used, by, esa, s, astronauts, to, get, into, space, through, partnership, programmes, with, nasa, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, spacelab, programme, was, an, esa, nasa, joint, research, programme, that, had, esa, develop, and, manufacture, orbital, labs, for, the, space, shuttle, for, several, flights, on, which, esa, participate, with, astronauts, in, experiments, in, robotic, science, mission, and, exploration, missions, nasa, has, been, esa, s, main, partner, cassini, huygens, was, a, joint, nasa, esa, mission, along, with, the, infrared, space, observatory, integral, soho, and, others, also, the, hubble, space, telescope, is, a, joint, project, of, nasa, and, esa, future, esa, nasa, joint, projects, include, the, james, webb, space, telescope, and, the, proposed, laser, interferometer, space, antenna, nasa, has, supported, esa, s, marcopolo, r, mission, which, landed, on, asteroid, bennu, in, october, 2020, and, is, scheduled, to, return, a, sample, to, earth, for, further, analysis, in, 2023, nasa, and, esa, will, also, likely, join, for, a, mars, sample, return, mission, in, october, 2020, the, esa, entered, into, a, memorandum, of, understanding, mou, with, nasa, to, work, together, on, the, artemis, program, which, will, provide, an, orbiting, lunar, gateway, and, also, accomplish, the, first, crewed, lunar, landing, in, 50, years, whose, team, will, include, the, first, woman, on, the, moon, astronaut, selection, announcements, are, expected, within, two, years, of, the, 2024, scheduled, launch, date, esa, also, purchases, seats, on, the, nasa, operated, commercial, crew, program, the, first, esa, astronaut, to, be, on, a, commercial, crew, program, mission, is, thomas, pesquet, pesquet, launched, into, space, aboard, crew, dragon, endeavour, on, the, crew, 2, mission, esa, also, has, seats, on, crew, 3, with, matthias, maurer, and, crew, 4, with, samantha, cristoforetti, in, 2023, following, the, successful, launch, of, the, euclid, telescope, in, july, on, a, falcon, 9, rocket, esa, approached, spacex, to, launch, four, galileo, communication, satellites, on, two, falcon, 9, rockets, in, 2024, however, it, would, require, approval, from, the, european, commission, and, all, member, states, of, the, european, union, to, proceed, since, china, has, invested, more, money, into, space, activities, the, chinese, space, agency, has, sought, international, partnerships, besides, the, russian, space, agency, esa, is, one, of, its, most, important, partners, both, space, agencies, cooperated, in, the, development, of, the, double, star, mission, in, 2017, esa, sent, two, astronauts, to, china, for, two, weeks, sea, survival, training, with, chinese, astronauts, in, yantai, shandong, esa, entered, into, a, major, joint, venture, with, russia, in, the, form, of, the, csts, the, preparation, of, french, guiana, spaceport, for,

programme, that, was, initiated, in, 2001, the, esa, is, an, independent, space, agency, and, not, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, european, union, although, they, have, common, goals, share, funding, and, work, together, often, the, initial, aim, of, the, european, union, eu, was, to, make, the, european, space, agency, an, agency, of, the, eu, by, 2014, while, the, eu, and, its, member, states, fund, together, 86, of, the, budget, of, the, esa, it, is, not, an, eu, agency, furthermore, the, esa, has, several, non, eu, members, most, notably, the, united, kingdom, which, had, left, the, eu, while, remaining, a, full, member, of, the, esa, the, esa, is, partnered, with, the, eu, on, its, two, current, flagship, space, programmes, the, copernicus, series, of, earth, observation, satellites, and, the, galileo, satellite, navigation, system, withthe, esa, providing, technical, oversight, and, in, the, case, of, copernicus, some, of, the, funding, the, eu, though, has, shown, an, interest, in, expanding, into, new, areas, whence, the, proposal, to, rename, and, expand, its, satellite, navigation, agency, the, european, gnss, agency, into, the, eu, agency, for, the, space, programme, the, proposal, drew, strong, criticism, from, the, esa, as, it, was, perceived, as, encroaching, on, the, esa, s, turf, in, january, 2021, after, years, of, acrimonious, relations, eu, and, esa, officials, mended, their, relationship, with, the, eu, internal, market, commissioner, thierry, breton, saying, the, european, space, policy, will, continue, to, rely, on, the, esa, and, its, unique, technical, engineering, and, science, expertise, and, that, the, esa, will, continue, to, be, the, european, agency, for, space, matters, if, we, are, to, be, successful, in, our, european, strategy, for, space, and, we, will, be, i, will, need, the, esa, by, my, side, esa, director, aschbacher, reciprocated, saying, i, would, really, like, to, make, the, esa, the, main, agency, the, go, to, agency, of, the, european, commission, for, all, its, flagship, programmes, the, esa, and, euspa, are, now, seen, to, have, distinct, roles, and, competencies, which, will, be, officialised, in, the, financial, framework, partnership, agreement, ffpa, whereas, the, esa, s, focus, will, be, on, the, technical, elements, of, the, eu, space, programmes, the, euspa, will, handle, the,
