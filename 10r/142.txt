a, resistor, is, a, passive, two, terminal, electrical, component, that, implements, electrical, resistance, as, a, circuit, element, in, electronic, circuits, resistors, are, used, to, reduce, current, flow, adjust, signal, levels, to, divide, voltages, bias, active, elements, and, terminate, transmission, lines, among, other, uses, high, power, resistors, that, can, dissipate, many, watts, of, electrical, power, as, heat, may, be, used, as, part, of, motor, controls, in, power, distribution, systems, or, as, test, loads, for, generators, fixed, resistors, have, resistances, that, only, change, slightly, with, temperature, time, or, operating, voltage, variable, resistors, can, be, used, to, adjust, circuit, elements, such, as, a, volume, control, or, a, lamp, dimmer, or, as, sensing, devices, for, heat, light, humidity, force, or, chemical, activity, resistors, are, common, elements, of, electrical, networks, and, electronic, circuits, and, are, ubiquitous, in, electronic, equipment, practical, resistors, as, discrete, components, can, be, composed, of, various, compounds, and, forms, resistors, are, also, implemented, within, integrated, circuits, the, electrical, function, of, a, resistor, is, specified, by, its, resistance, common, commercial, resistors, are, manufactured, over, a, range, of, more, than, nine, orders, of, magnitude, the, nominal, value, of, the, resistance, falls, within, the, manufacturing, tolerance, indicated, on, the, component, two, typical, schematic, diagram, symbols, are, as, follows, the, notation, to, state, a, resistor, s, value, in, a, circuit, diagram, varies, one, common, scheme, is, the, rkm, code, following, iec, 60062, rather, than, using, a, decimal, separator, this, notation, uses, a, letter, loosely, associated, with, si, prefixes, corresponding, with, the, part, s, resistance, for, example, 8k2, as, part, marking, code, in, a, circuit, diagram, or, in, a, bill, of, materials, bom, indicates, a, resistor, value, of, 8, 2, k, additional, zeros, imply, a, tighter, tolerance, for, example, 15m0, for, three, significant, digits, when, the, value, can, be, expressed, without, the, need, for, a, prefix, that, is, multiplicator, 1, an, r, is, used, instead, of, the, decimal, separator, for, example, 1r2, indicates, 1, 2, and, 18r, indicates, 18, an, ideal, resistor, i, e, a, resistance, without, reactance, obeys, ohm, s, law, v, i, r, displaystyle, v, i, cdot, r, ohm, s, law, states, that, the, voltage, v, displaystyle, v, across, a, resistor, is, proportional, to, the, current, i, displaystyle, i, passing, through, it, where, the, constant, of, proportionality, is, the, resistance, r, displaystyle, r, for, example, if, a, 300, ohm, resistor, is, attached, across, the, terminals, of, a, 12, volt, battery, then, a, current, of, 12, 300, 0, 04, amperes, flows, through, that, resistor, the, ohm, symbol, is, the, si, unit, of, electrical, resistance, named, after, georg, simon, ohm, an, ohm, is, equivalent, to, a, volt, per, ampere, since, resistors, are, specified, and, manufactured, over, a, very, large, range, of, values, the, derived, units, of, milliohm, 1, m, 10, 3, kilohm, 1, k, 10, 3, and, megohm, 1, m, 10, 6, are, also, in, common, usage, p, 20, the, total, resistance, of, resistors, connected, in, series, is, the, sum, of, their, individual, resistance, values, r, e, q, i, 1, n, r, i, r, 1, r, 2, r, n, displaystyle, r, mathrm, eq, sum, i, 1, n, r, i, r, 1, r, 2, cdots, r, n, the, total, resistance, of, resistors, connected, in, parallel, is, the, reciprocal, of, the, sum, of, the, reciprocals, of, the, individual, resistors, p, 20ff, r, e, q, i, 1, n, 1, r, i, 1, 1, r, 1, 1, r, 2, 1, r, 3, 1, r, n, 1, displaystyle, r, mathrm, eq,

ohm, resistor, and, a, 15, ohm, resistor, produces, 1, 1, 10, 1, 5, 1, 15, ohms, of, resistance, or, 30, 11, 2, 727, ohms, a, resistor, network, that, is, a, combination, of, parallel, and, series, connections, can, be, broken, up, into, smaller, parts, that, are, either, one, or, the, other, some, complex, networks, of, resistors, cannot, be, resolved, in, this, manner, requiring, more, sophisticated, circuit, analysis, generally, the, y, transform, or, matrix, methods, can, be, used, to, solve, such, problems, at, any, instant, the, power, p, watts, consumed, by, a, resistor, of, resistance, r, ohms, is, calculated, as, p, i, v, i, 2, r, v, 2, r, displaystyle, p, iv, i, 2, r, frac, v, 2, r, where, v, volts, is, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, and, i, amps, is, the, current, flowing, through, it, using, ohm, s, law, the, two, other, forms, can, be, derived, this, power, is, converted, into, heat, which, must, be, dissipated, by, the, resistor, s, package, before, its, temperature, rises, excessively, p, 22, resistors, are, rated, according, to, their, maximum, power, dissipation, discrete, resistors, in, solid, state, electronic, systems, are, typically, rated, as, 1, 10, 1, 8, or, 1, 4, watt, they, usually, absorb, much, less, than, a, watt, of, electrical, power, and, require, little, attention, to, their, power, rating, power, resistors, are, required, to, dissipate, substantial, amounts, of, power, and, are, typically, used, in, power, supplies, power, conversion, circuits, and, power, amplifiers, this, designation, is, loosely, applied, to, resistors, with, power, ratings, of, 1, watt, or, greater, power, resistors, are, physically, larger, and, may, not, use, the, preferred, values, color, codes, and, external, packages, described, below, if, the, average, power, dissipated, by, a, resistor, is, more, than, its, power, rating, damage, to, the, resistor, may, occur, permanently, altering, its, resistance, this, is, distinct, from, the, reversible, change, in, resistance, due, to, its, temperature, coefficient, when, it, warms, excessive, power, dissipation, may, raise, the, temperature, of, the, resistor, to, a, point, where, it, can, burn, the, circuit, board, or, adjacent, components, or, even, cause, a, fire, there, are, flameproof, resistors, that, will, not, produce, flames, with, any, overload, of, any, duration, resistors, may, be, specified, with, higher, rated, dissipation, than, is, experienced, in, service, to, account, for, poor, air, circulation, high, altitude, or, high, operating, temperature, all, resistors, have, a, maximum, voltage, rating, this, may, limit, the, power, dissipation, for, higher, resistance, values, for, instance, among, 1, 4, watt, resistors, a, very, common, sort, of, leaded, resistor, one, is, listed, with, a, resistance, of, 100, m, and, a, maximum, rated, voltage, of, 750, v, however, even, placing, 750, v, across, a, 100, m, resistor, continuously, would, only, result, in, a, power, dissipation, of, less, than, 6, mw, making, the, nominal, 1, 4, watt, rating, meaningless, practical, resistors, have, a, series, inductance, and, a, small, parallel, capacitance, these, specifications, can, be, important, in, high, frequency, applications, and, while, even, an, ideal, resistor, inherently, has, johnson, noise, some, resistors, have, worse, noise, characteristics, and, so, may, be, an, issue, for, low, noise, amplifiers, or, other, sensitive, electronics, in, some, precision, applications, the, temperature, coefficient, of, the, resistance, may, also, be, of, concern, the, unwanted, inductance, excess, noise, and, temperature, coefficient, are, mainly, dependent, on, the, technology, used, in, manufacturing, the, resistor, they, are, not, normally, specified, individually, for, a, particular, family, of, resistors, manufactured, using, a, particular, technology, a, family, of, discrete, resistors, may, also, be, characterized, according, to, its, form, factor, that, is, the, size, of, the, device, and, the, position, of, its, leads, or, terminals, this, is, relevant, in, the, practical, manufacturing, of, circuits, that, may, use, them, practical, resistors, are, also, specified, as, having, a, maximum, power, rating, which, must, exceed, the, anticipated, power, dissipation, of, that, resistor, in, a, particular, circuit, this, is, mainly, of, concern, in, power, electronics, applications, resistors, with, higher, power, ratings, are, physically, larger, and, may, require, heat, sinks, in, a, high, voltage, circuit, attention, must, sometimes, be, paid, to, the, rated, maximum, working, voltage, of, the, resistor, while, there, is, no, minimum, working, voltage, for, a, given, resistor, failure, to, account, for, a, resistor, s, maximum, rating, may, cause, the, resistor, to, incinerate, when, current, is, run, through, it, through, hole, components, typically, have, leads, pronounced, l, i, d, z, leaving, the, body, axially, that, is, on, a, line, parallel, with, the, part, s, longest, axis, others, have, leads, coming, off, their, body, radially, instead, other, components, may, be, smt, surface, mount, technology, while, high, power, resistors, may, have, one, of, their, leads, designed, into, the, heat, sink, carbon, composition, resistors, ccr, consist, of, a, solid, cylindrical, resistive, element, with, embedded, wire, leads, or, metal, end, caps, to, which, the, lead, wires, are, attached, the, body, of, the, resistor, is, protected, with, paint, or, plastic, early, 20th, century, carbon, composition, resistors, had, uninsulated, bodies, the, lead, wires, were, wrapped, around, the, ends, of, the, resistance, element, rod, and, soldered, the, completed, resistor, was, painted, for, color, coding, of, its, value, the, resistive, element, in, carbon, composition, resistors, is, made, from, a, mixture, of, finely, powdered, carbon, and, an, insulating, material, usually, ceramic, a, resin, holds, the, mixture, together, the, resistance, is, determined, by, the, ratio, of, the, fill, material, the, powdered, ceramic, to, the, carbon, higher, concentrations, of, carbon, which, is, a, good, conductor, result, in, lower, resistances, carbon, composition, resistors, were, commonly, used, in, the, 1960s, and, earlier, but, are, not, popular, for, general, use, now, as, other, types, have, better, specifications, such, as, tolerance, voltage, dependence, and, stress, carbon, composition, resistors, change, value, when, stressed, with, over, voltages, moreover, if, internal, moisture, content, such, as, from, exposure, for, some, length, of, time, to, a, humid, environment, is, significant, soldering, heat, creates, a, non, reversible, change, in, resistance, value, carbon, composition, resistors, have, poor, stability, with, time, and, were, consequently, factory, sorted, to, at, best, only, 5, tolerance, these, resistors, are, non, inductive, which, provides, benefits, when, used, in, voltage, pulse, reduction, and, surge, protection, applications, carbon, composition, resistors, have, higher, capability, to, withstand, overload, relative, to, the, component, s, size, carbon, composition, resistors, are, still, available, but, relatively, expensive, values, ranged, from, fractions, of, an, ohm, to, 22, megohms, due, to, their, high, price, these, resistors, are, no, longer, used, in, most, applications, however, they, are, used, in, power, supplies, and, welding, controls, they, are, also, in, demand, for, repair, of, vintage, electronic, equipment, where, authenticity, is, a, factor, a, carbon, pile, resistor, is, made, of, a, stack, of, carbon, disks, compressed, between, two, metal, contact, plates, adjusting, the, clamping, pressure, changes, the, resistance, between, the, plates, these, resistors, are, used, when, an, adjustable, load, is, required, such, as, in, testing, automotive, batteries, or, radio, transmitters, a, carbon, pile, resistor, can, also, be, used, as, a, speed, control, for, small, motors, in, household, appliances, sewing, machines, hand, held, mixers, with, ratings, up, to, a, few, hundred, watts, a, carbon, pile, resistor, can, be, incorporated, in, automatic, voltage, regulators, for, generators, where, the, carbon, pile, controls, the, field, current, to, maintain, relatively, constant, voltage, this, principle, is, also, applied, in, the, carbon, microphone, in, manufacturing, carbon, film, resistors, a, carbon, film, is, deposited, on, an, insulating, substrate, and, a, helix, is, cut, in, it, to, create, a, long, narrow, resistive, path, varying, shapes, coupled, with, the, resistivity, of, amorphous, carbon, ranging, from, 500, to, 800, m, can, provide, a, wide, range, of, resistance, values, carbon, film, resistors, feature, lower, noise, compared, to, carbon, composition, resistors, because, of, the, precise, distribution, of, the, pure, graphite, without, binding, carbon, film, resistors, feature, a, power, rating, range, of, 0, 125, w, to, 5, w, at, 70, c, resistances, available, range, from, 1, ohm, to, 10, megaohm, the, carbon, film, resistor, has, an, operating, temperature, range, of, 55, c, to, 155, c, it, has, 200, to, 600, volts, maximum, working, voltage, range, special, carbon, film, resistors, are, used, in, applications, requiring, high, pulse, stability, carbon, composition, resistors, can, be, printed, directly, onto, printed, circuit, board, pcb, substrates, as, part, of, the, pcb, manufacturing, process, although, this, technique, is, more, common, on, hybrid, pcb, modules, it, can, also, be, used, on, standard, fibreglass, pcbs, tolerances, are, typically, quite, large, and, can, be, in, the, order, of, 30, a, typical, application, would, be, non, critical, pull, up, resistors, thick, film, resistors, became, popular, during, the, 1970s, and, most, smd, surface, mount, device, resistors, today, are, of, this, type, the, resistive, element, of, thick, films, is, 1000, times, thicker, than, thin, films, but, the, principal, difference, is, how, the, film, is, applied, to, the, cylinder, axial, resistors, or, the, surface, smd, resistors, thin, film, resistors, are, made, by, sputtering, a, method, of, vacuum, deposition, the, resistive, material, onto, an, insulating, substrate, the, film, is, then, etched, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, old, subtractive, process, for, making, printed, circuit, boards, that, is, the, surface, is, coated, with, a, photo, sensitive, material, covered, by, a, pattern, film, irradiated, with, ultraviolet, light, and, then, the, exposed, photo, sensitive, coating, is, developed, and, underlying, thin, film, is, etched, away, thick, film, resistors, are, manufactured, using, screen, and, stencil, printing, processes, because, the, time, during, which, the, sputtering, is, performed, can, be, controlled, the, thickness, of, the, thin, film, can, be, accurately, controlled, the, type, of, material, also, varies, consisting, of, one, or, more, ceramic, cermet, conductors, such, as, tantalum, nitride, tan, ruthenium, oxide, ruo, 2, lead, oxide, pbo, bismuth, ruthenate, bi, 2, ru, 2, o, 7, nickel, chromium, nicr, or, bismuth, iridate, bi, 2, ir, 2, o, 7, the, resistance, of, both, thin, and, thick, film, resistors, after, manufacture, is, not, highly, accurate, they, are, usually, trimmed, to, an, accurate, value, by, abrasive, or, laser, trimming, thin, film, resistors, are, usually, specified, with, tolerances, of, 1, and, 5, and, with, temperature, coefficients, of, 5, to, 50, ppm, k, they, also, have, much, lower, noise, levels, on, the, level, of, 10, 100, times, less, than, thick, film, resistors, thick, film, resistors, may, use, the, same, conductive, ceramics, but, they, are, mixed, with, sintered, powdered, glass, and, a, carrier, liquid, so, that, the, composite, can, be, screen, printed, this, composite, of, glass, and, conductive, ceramic, cermet, material, is, then, fused, baked, in, an, oven, at, about, 850, c, when, first, manufactured, thick, film, resistors, had, tolerances, of, 5, but, standard, tolerances, have, improved, to, 2, or, 1, in, the, last, few, decades, temperature, coefficients, of, thick, film, resistors, are, typically, 200, or, 250, ppm, k, a, 40, kelvin, 70, f, temperature, change, can, change, the, resistance, by, 1, thin, film, resistors, are, usually, far, more, expensive, than, thick, film, resistors, for, example, smd, thin, film, resistors, with, 0, 5, tolerances, and, with, 25, ppm, k, temperature, coefficients, when, bought, in, full, size, reel, quantities, are, about, twice, the, cost, of, 1, 250, ppm, k, thick, film, resistors, a, common, type, of, axial, leaded, resistor, today, is, the, metal, film, resistor, metal, electrode, leadless, face, melf, resistors, often, use, the, same, technology, metal, film, resistors, are, usually, coated, with, nickel, chromium, nicr, but, might, be, coated, with, any, of, the, cermet, materials, listed, above, for, thin, film, resistors, unlike, thin, film, resistors, the, material, may, be, applied, using, different, techniques, than, sputtering, though, this, is, one, technique, used, the, resistance, value, is, determined, by, cutting, a, helix, through, the, coating, rather, than, by, etching, similar, to, the, way, carbon, resistors, are, made, the, result, is, a, reasonable, tolerance, 0, 5, 1, or, 2, and, a, temperature, coefficient, that, is, generally, between, 50, and, 100, ppm, k, metal, film, resistors, possess, good, noise, characteristics, and, low, non, linearity, due, to, a, low, voltage, coefficient, they, are, also, beneficial, due, to, long, term, stability, metal, oxide, film, resistors, are, made, of, metal, oxides, which, results, in, a, higher, operating, temperature, and, greater, stability, and, reliability, than, metal, film, they, are, used, in, applications, with, high, endurance, demands, wirewound, resistors, are, commonly, made, by, winding, a, metal, wire, usually, nichrome, around, a, ceramic, plastic, or, fiberglass, core, the, ends, of, the, wire, are, soldered, or, welded, to, two, caps, or, rings, attached, to, the, ends, of, the, core, the, assembly, is, protected, with, a, layer, of, paint, molded, plastic, or, an, enamel, coating, baked, at, high, temperature, these, resistors, are, designed, to, withstand, unusually, high, temperatures, of, up, to, 450, c, wire, leads, in, low, power, wirewound, resistors, are, usually, between, 0, 6, and, 0, 8, mm, in, diameter, and, tinned, for, ease, of, soldering, for, higher, power, wirewound, resistors, either, a, ceramic, outer, case, or, an, aluminum, outer, case, on, top, of, an, insulating, layer, is, used, if, the, outer, case, is, ceramic, such, resistors, are, sometimes, described, as, cement, resistors, though, they, do, not, actually, contain, any, traditional, cement, the, aluminum, cased, types, are, designed, to, be, attached, to, a, heat, sink, to, dissipate, the, heat, the, rated, power, is, dependent, on, being, used, with, a, suitable, heat, sink, e, g, a, 50, w, power, rated, resistor, overheats, at, a, fraction, of, the, power, dissipation, if, not, used, with, a, heat, sink, large, wirewound, resistors, may, be, rated, for, 1, 000, watts, or, more, because, wirewound, resistors, are, coils, they, have, more, undesirable, inductance, than, other, types, of, resistor, however, winding, the, wire, in, sections, with, alternately, reversed, direction, can, minimize, inductance, other, techniques, employ, bifilar, winding, or, a, flat, thin, former, to, reduce, cross, section, area, of, the, coil, for, the, most, demanding, circuits, resistors, with, ayrton, perry, winding, are, used, applications, of, wirewound, resistors, are, similar, to, those, of, composition, resistors, with, the, exception, of, high, frequency, applications, the, high, frequency, response, of, wirewound, resistors, is, substantially, worse, than, that, of, a, composition, resistor, in, 1960, felix, zandman, and, sidney, j, stein, presented, a, development, of, resistor, film, of, very, high, stability, the, primary, resistance, element, of, a, foil, resistor, is, a, chromium, nickel, alloy, foil, several, micrometers, thick, chromium, nickel, alloys, are, characterized, by, having, a, large, electrical, resistance, about, 58, times, that, of, copper, a, small, temperature, coefficient, and, high, resistance, to, oxidation, examples, are, chromel, a, and, nichrome, v, whose, typical, composition, is, 80, ni, and, 20, cr, with, a, melting, point, of, 1420, c, when, iron, is, added, the, chromium, nickel, alloy, becomes, more, ductile, the, nichrome, and, chromel, c, are, examples, of, an, alloy, containing, iron, the, composition, typical, of, nichrome, is, 60, ni, 12, cr, 26, fe, 2, mn, and, chromel, c, 64, ni, 11, cr, fe, 25, the, melting, temperature, of, these, alloys, are, 1350, c, and, 1390, c, respectively, since, their, introduction, in, the, 1960s, foil, resistors, have, had, the, best, precision, and, stability, of, any, resistor, available, one, of, the, important, parameters, of, stability, is, the, temperature, coefficient, of, resistance, tcr, the, tcr, of, foil, resistors, is, extremely, low, and, has, been, further, improved, over, the, years, one, range, of, ultra, precision, foil,

also, has, to, do, with, the, opposing, effects, of, the, metal, s, electrical, resistance, increasing, with, temperature, and, being, reduced, by, thermal, expansion, leading, to, an, increase, in, thickness, of, the, foil, whose, other, dimensions, are, constrained, by, a, ceramic, substrate, an, ammeter, shunt, is, a, special, type, of, current, sensing, resistor, having, four, terminals, and,

insulating, base, between, the, blocks, and, soldered, or, brazed, to, them, are, one, or, more, strips, of, low, temperature, coefficient, of, resistance, tcr, manganin, alloy, large, bolts, threaded, into, the, blocks, make, the, current, connections, while, much, smaller, screws, provide, volt, meter, connections, shunts, are, rated, by, full, scale, current, and, often, have, a, voltage, drop, of, 50, mv, at, rated, current, such, meters, are, adapted, to, the, shunt, full, current, rating, by, using, an, appropriately, marked, dial, face, no, change, need, to, be, made, to, the, other, parts, of, the, meter, in, heavy, duty, industrial, high, current, applications, a, grid, resistor, is, a, large, convection, cooled, lattice, of, stamped, metal, alloy, strips, connected, in, rows, between, two, electrodes, such, industrial, grade, resistors, can, be, as, large, as, a, refrigerator, some, designs, can, handle, over, 500, amperes, of, current, with, a, range, of,

ac, distribution, control, loads, for, cranes, and, heavy, equipment, load, testing, of, generators, and, harmonic, filtering, for, electric, substations, the, term, grid, resistor, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, a, resistor, of, any, type, connected, to, the, control, grid, of, a, vacuum, tube, this, is, not, a, resistor, technology, it, is, an, electronic, circuit, topology, a, resistor, may, have, one, or, more, fixed, tapping, points, so, that, the, resistance, can, be, changed, by, moving, the, connecting, wires, to, different, terminals, some, wirewound, power, resistors, have, a, tapping, point, that, can, slide, along, the, resistance, element, allowing, a, larger, or, smaller, part, of, the, resistance, to, be, used, where, continuous, adjustment, of, the, resistance, value,

wire, to, improve, resolution, these, typically, offer, ten, turns, of, their, shafts, to, cover, their, full, range, they, are, usually, set, with, dials, that, include, a, simple, turns, counter, and, a, graduated, dial, and, can, typically, achieve, three, digit, resolution, electronic, analog, computers, used, them, in, quantity, for, setting, coefficients, and, delayed, sweep, oscilloscopes, of, recent, decades, included, one, on, their, panels, a, resistance, decade, box, or, resistor, substitution, box, is, a, unit, containing, resistors, of, many, values, with, one, or, more, mechanical, switches, which, allow, any, one, of, various, discrete, resistances, offered, by, the, box, to, be, dialed, in, usually, the, resistance, is, accurate, to, high, precision, ranging, from, laboratory, calibration, grade, accuracy, of, 20, parts, per, million, to, field, grade, at, 1, inexpensive, boxes, with, lesser, accuracy, are, also, available, all, types, offer, a, convenient, way, of, selecting, and, quickly, changing, a, resistance, in, laboratory, experimental, and, development, work, without, needing, to, attach, resistors, one, by, one, or, even, stock, each, value, the, range, of, resistance, provided, the, maximum, resolution, and, the, accuracy, characterize, the, box, for, example, one, box, offers, resistances, from, 0, to, 100, megohms,

negative, temperature, coefficient, making, them, useful, for, measuring, temperatures, since, their, resistance, can, be, large, until, they, are, allowed, to, heat, up, due, to, the, passage, of, current, they, are, also, commonly, used, to, prevent, excessive, current, surges, when, equipment, is, powered, on, similarly, the, resistance, of, a, humistor, varies, with, humidity, one, sort, of, photodetector, the, photoresistor, has, a, resistance, which, varies, with, illumination, the, strain, gauge, invented, by, edward, e, simmons, and, arthur, c, ruge, in, 1938, is, a, type, of, resistor, that, changes, value, with, applied, strain, a, single, resistor, may, be, used, or, a, pair, half, bridge, or, four, resistors, connected, in, a, wheatstone, bridge, configuration, the, strain, resistor, is, bonded, with, adhesive, to, an, object, that, is, subjected, to, mechanical, strain, with, the, strain, gauge, and, a, filter, amplifier, and, analog, digital, converter, the, strain, on, an, object, can, be, measured, a, related, but, more, recent, invention, uses, a, quantum, tunnelling, composite, to, sense, mechanical, stress, it, passes, a, current, whose, magnitude, can, vary, by, a, factor, of, 10, 12, in, response, to, changes, in, applied, pressure, the, value, of, a, resistor, can, be, measured, with, an, ohmmeter, which, may, be, one, function, of, a, multimeter, usually, probes, on, the, ends, of, test, leads, connect, to, the, resistor, a, simple, ohmmeter, may, apply, a, voltage, from, a, battery, across, the, unknown, resistor, with, an, internal, resistor, of, a, known, value, in, series, producing, a, current, which, drives, a, meter, movement, the, current, in, accordance, with, ohm, s, law, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, sum, of, the, internal, resistance, and, the, resistor, being, tested, resulting, in, an, analog, meter, scale, which, is, very, non, linear, calibrated, from, infinity, to, 0, ohms, a, digital, multimeter, using, active, electronics, may, instead, pass, a, specified, current, through, the, test, resistance, the, voltage, generated, across, the, test, resistance, in, that, case, is, linearly, proportional, to, its, resistance, which, is, measured, and, displayed, in, either, case, the, low, resistance, ranges, of, the, meter, pass, much, more, current, through, the, test, leads, than, do, high, resistance, ranges, this, allows, for, the, voltages, present, to, be, at, reasonable, levels, generally, below, 10, volts, but, still, measurable, measuring, low, value, resistors, such, as, fractional, ohm, resistors, with, acceptable, accuracy, requires, four, terminal, connections, one, pair, of, terminals, applies, a, known, calibrated, current, to, the, resistor, while, the, other, pair, senses, the, voltage, drop, across, the, resistor, some, laboratory, quality, ohmmeters, milliohmmeters, and, even, some, of, the, better, digital, multimeters, sense, using, four, input, terminals, for, this, purpose, which, may, be, used, with, special, test, leads, called, kelvin, clips, each, of, the, two, clips, has, a, pair, of, jaws, insulated, from, each, other, one, side, of, each, clip, applies, the, measuring, current, while, the, other, connections, are, only, to, sense, the, voltage, drop, the, resistance, is, again, calculated, using, ohm, s, law, as, the, measured, voltage, divided, by, the, applied, current, resistor, characteristics, are, quantified, and, reported, using, various, national, standards, in, the, us, mil, std, 202, contains, the, relevant, test, methods, to, which, other, standards, refer, there, are, various, standards, specifying, properties, of, resistors, for, use, in, equipment, there, are, other, united, states, military, procurement, mil, r, standards, the, primary, standard, for, resistance, the, mercury, ohm, was, initially, defined, in, 1884, in, as, a, column, of, mercury, 106, 3, cm, long, and, 1, square, millimeter, in, cross, section, at, 0, degrees, celsius, difficulties, in, precisely, measuring, the, physical, constants, to, replicate, this, standard, result, in, variations, of, as, much, as, 30, ppm, from, 1900, the, mercury, ohm, was, replaced, with, a, precision, machined, plate, of, manganin, since, 1990, the, international, resistance, standard, has, been, based, on, the, quantized, hall, effect, discovered, by, klaus, von, klitzing, for, which, he, won, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1985, resistors, of, extremely, high, precision, are, manufactured, for, calibration, and, laboratory, use, they, may, have, four, terminals, using, one, pair, to, carry, an, operating, current, and, the, other, pair, to, measure, the, voltage, drop, this, eliminates, errors, caused, by, voltage, drops, across, the, lead, resistances, because, no, charge, flows, through, voltage, sensing, leads, it, is, important, in, small, value, resistors, 100, 0, 0001, ohm, where, lead, resistance, is, significant, or, even, comparable, with, respect, to, resistance, standard, value, axial, resistor, cases, are, usually, tan, brown, blue, or, green, though, other, colors, are, occasionally, found, as, well, such, as, dark, red, or, dark, gray, and, display, three, to, six, colored, stripes, that, indicate, resistance, and, by, extension, tolerance, and, may, include, bands, to, indicate, the, temperature, coefficient, and, reliability, class, in, four, striped, resistors, the, first, two, stripes, represent, the, first, two, digits, of, the, resistance, in, ohms, the, third, represents, a, multiplier, and, the, fourth, the, tolerance, which, if, absent, denotes, 20, for, five, and, six, striped, resistors, the, third, band, is, the, third, digit, the, fourth, is, the, multiplier, and, the, fifth, is, the, tolerance, a, sixth, stripe, represents, the, temperature, coefficient, the, power, rating, of, the, resistor, is, usually, not, marked, and, is, deduced, from, its, size, surface, mount, resistors, are, marked, numerically, early, 20th, century, resistors, essentially, uninsulated, were, dipped, in, paint, to, cover, their, entire, body, for, color, coding, this, base, color, represented, the, first, digit, a, second, color, of, paint, was, applied, to, one, end, of, the, element, to, represent, a, second, digit, and, a, color, dot, or, band, in, the, middle, provided, the, third, digit, the, rule, was, body, tip, dot, providing, two, significant, digits, for, value, and, the, decimal, multiplier, in, that, sequence, default, tolerance, was, 20, closer, tolerance, resistors, had, silver, 10, or, gold, colored, 5, paint, on, the, other, end, early, resistors, were, made, in, more, or, less, arbitrary, round, numbers, a, series, might, have, 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, etc, early, power, wirewound, resistors, such, as, brown, vitreous, enameled, types, were, made, with, a, system, of, preferred, values, like, some, of, those, mentioned, here, resistors, as, manufactured, are, subject, to, a, certain, percentage, tolerance, and, it, makes, sense, to, manufacture, values, that, correlate, with, the, tolerance, so, that, the, actual, value, of, a, resistor, overlaps, slightly, with, its, neighbors, wider, spacing, leaves, gaps, narrower, spacing, increases, manufacturing, and, inventory, costs, to, provide, resistors, that, are, more, or, less, interchangeable, a, logical, scheme, is, to, produce, resistors, in, a, range, of, values, which, increase, in, a, geometric, progression, so, that, each, value, is, greater, than, its, predecessor, by, a, fixed, multiplier, or, percentage, chosen, to, match, the, tolerance, of, the, range, for, example, for, a, tolerance, of, 20, it, makes, sense, to, have, each, resistor, about, 1, 5, times, its, predecessor, covering, a, decade, in, 6, values, more, precisely, the, factor, used, is, 1, 4678, 10, 1, 6, displaystyle, 10, 1, 6, giving, values, of, 1, 47, 2, 15, 3, 16, 4, 64, 6, 81, 10, for, the, 1, 10, decade, a, decade, is, a, range, increasing, by, a, factor, of, 10, 0, 1, 1, and, 10, 100, are, other, examples, these, are, rounded, in, practice, to, 1, 5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 6, 8, 10, followed, by, 15, 22, 33, and, preceded, by, 0, 47, 0, 68, 1, this, scheme, has, been, adopted, as, the, e6, series, of, the, iec, 60063, preferred, number, values, there, are, also, e12, e24, e48, e96, and, e192, series, for, components, of, progressively, finer, resolution, with, 12, 24, 48, 96, and, 192, different, values, within, each, decade, the, actual, values, used, are, in, the, iec, 60063, lists, of, preferred, numbers, a, resistor, of, 100, ohms, 20, would, be, expected, to, have, a, value, between, 80, and, 120, ohms, its, e6, neighbors, are, 68, 54, 82, and, 150, 120, 180, ohms, a, sensible, spacing, e6, is, used, for, 20, components, e12, for, 10, e24, for, 5, e48, for, 2, e96, for, 1, e192, for, 0, 5, or, better, resistors, are, manufactured, in, values, from, a, few, milliohms, to, about, a, gigaohm, in, iec60063, ranges, appropriate, for, their, tolerance, manufacturers, may, sort, resistors, into, tolerance, classes, based, on, measurement, accordingly, a, selection, of, 100, ohms, resistors, with, a, tolerance, of, 10, might, not, lie, just, around, 100, ohm, but, no, more, than, 10, off, as, one, would, expect, a, bell, curve, but, rather, be, in, two, groups, either, between, 5, and, 10, too, high, or, 5, to, 10, too, low, but, not, closer, to, 100, ohm, than, that, because, any, resistors, the, factory, had, measured, as, being, less, than, 5, off, would, have, been, marked, and, sold, as, resistors, with, only, 5, tolerance, or, better, when, designing, a, circuit, this, may, become, a, consideration, this, process, of, sorting, parts, based, on, post, production, measurement, is, known, as, binning, and, can, be, applied, to, other, components, than, resistors, such, as, speed, grades, for, cpus, surface, mounted, resistors, of, larger, sizes, metric, 1608, and, above, are, printed, with, numerical, values, in, a, code, related, to, that, used, on, axial, resistors, standard, tolerance, surface, mount, technology, smt, resistors, are, marked, with, a, three, digit, code, in, which, the, first, two, digits, are, the, first, two, significant, digits, of, the, value, and, the, third, digit, is, the, power, of, ten, the, number, of, zeroes, for, example, resistances, less, than, 100, are, written, 100, 220, 470, the, final, zero, represents, ten, to, the, power, zero, which, is, 1, for, example, sometimes, these, values, are, marked, as, 10, or, 22, to, prevent, a, mistake, resistances, less, than, 10, have, r, to, indicate, the, position, of, the, decimal, point, radix, point, for, example, 000, and, 0000, sometimes, appear, as, values, on, surface, mount, zero, ohm, links, since, these, have, approximately, zero, resistance, more, recent, surface, mount, resistors, are, too, small, physically, to, permit, practical, markings, to, be, applied, many, precision, resistors, including, surface, mount, and, axial, lead, types, are, marked, with, a, four, digit, code, the, first, three, digits, are, the, significant, figures, and, the, fourth, is, the, power, of, ten, for, example, axial, lead, precision, resistors, often, use, color, code, bands, to, represent, this, four, digit, code, the, former, eia, 96, marking, system, now, included, in, iec, 60062, 2016, is, a, more, compact, marking, system, intended, for, physically, small, high, precision, resistors, it, uses, a, two, digit, code, plus, a, letter, a, total, of, three, alphanumeric, characters, to, indicate, 1, resistance, values, to, three, significant, digits, the, two, digits, from, 01, to, 96, are, a, code, that, indicates, one, of, the, 96, positions, in, the, standard, e96, series, of, 1, resistor, values, the, uppercase, letter, is, a, code, that, indicates, a, power, of, ten, multiplier, for, example, the, marking, 01c, represents, 10, kohm, 10c, represents, 12, 4, kohm, 96c, represents, 97, 6, kohm, steps, to, find, out, the, resistance, or, capacitance, values, if, a, resistor, is, coded, there, are, several, common, usage, patterns, that, resistors, are, commonly, configured, in, resistors, are, commonly, used, to, limit, the, amount, of, current, flowing, through, a, circuit, many, circuit, components, such, as, leds, require, the, current, flowing, through, them, to, be, limited, but, do, not, themselves, limit, the, amount, of, current, therefore, oftentimes, resistors, will, be, added, to, prevent, overcurrent, situations, additionally, oftentimes, circuits, do, not, need, the, amount, of, current, that, would, be, otherwise, flowing, through, them, so, resistors, can, be, added, to, limit, the, power, consumption, of, such, circuits, oftentimes, circuits, need, to, provide, various, reference, voltages, for, other, circuits, such, as, voltage, comparators, a, fixed, voltage, can, be, obtained, by, taking, two, resistors, in, series, between, two, other, fixed, voltages, such, as, the, source, voltage, and, ground, the, terminal, between, the, two, resistors, will, be, at, a, voltage, that, is, between, the, two, voltages, at, a, linear, distance, based, on, the, relative, resistances, of, the, two, resistors, for, instance, if, a, 200, ohm, resistor, and, a, 400, ohm, resistor, are, placed, in, series, between, 6, v, and, 0, v, the, terminal, between, them, will, be, at, 4, v, when, a, circuit, is, not, connected, to, power, the, voltage, of, that, circuit, is, not, zero, but, undefined, it, can, be, influenced, by, previous, voltages, or, the, environment, a, pull, up, or, pull, down, resistor, provides, a, voltage, for, a, circuit, when, it, is, otherwise, disconnected, such, as, when, a, button, is, not, pushed, down, or, a, transistor, is, not, active, a, pull, up, resistor, connects, the, circuit, to, a, high, positive, voltage, if, the, circuit, requires, a, high, positive, default, voltage, and, a, pull, down, resistor, connects, the, circuit, to, a, low, voltage, or, ground, if, the, circuit, requires, a, low, default, voltage, the, resistor, value, must, be, high, enough, so, that, when, the, circuit, is, active, the, voltage, source, it, is, attached, to, does, not, over, influence, the, function, of, the, circuit, but, low, enough, so, that, it, pulls, quickly, enough, when, the, circuit, is, deactivated, and, does, not, significantly, alter, the, voltage, from, the, source, value, in, amplifying, faint, signals, it, is, often, necessary, to, minimize, electronic, noise, particularly, in, the, first, stage, of, amplification, as, a, dissipative, element, even, an, ideal, resistor, naturally, produces, a, randomly, fluctuating, voltage, or, noise, across, its, terminals, this, johnson, nyquist, noise, is, a, fundamental, noise, source, which, depends, only, upon, the, temperature, and, resistance, of, the, resistor, and, is, predicted, by, the, fluctuation, dissipation, theorem, using, a, larger, value, of, resistance, produces, a, larger, voltage, noise, whereas, a, smaller, value, of, resistance, generates, more, current, noise, at, a, given, temperature, the, thermal, noise, of, a, practical, resistor, may, also, be, larger, than, the, theoretical, prediction, and, that, increase, is, typically, frequency, dependent, excess, noise, of, a, practical, resistor, is, observed, only, when, current, flows, through, it, this, is, specified, in, unit, of, v, v, decade, v, of, noise, per, volt, applied, across, the, resistor, per, decade, of, frequency, the, v, v, decade, value, is, frequently, given, in, db, so, that, a, resistor, with, a, noise, index, of, 0, db, exhibits, 1, v, rms, of, excess, noise, for, each, volt, across, the, resistor, in, each, frequency, decade, excess, noise, is, thus, an, example, of, 1, f, noise, thick, film, and, carbon, composition, resistors, generate, more, excess, noise, than, other, types, at, low, frequencies, wire, wound, and, thin, film, resistors, are, often, used, for, their, better, noise, characteristics, carbon, composition, resistors, can, exhibit, a, noise, index, of, 0, db, while, bulk, metal, foil, resistors, may, have, a, noise, index, of, 40, db, usually, making, the, excess, noise, of, metal, foil, resistors, insignificant, thin, film, surface, mount, resistors, typically, have, lower, noise, and, better, thermal, stability, than, thick, film, surface, mount, resistors, excess, noise, is, also, size, dependent, in, general, excess, noise, is, reduced, as, the, physical, size, of, a, resistor, is, increased, or, multiple, resistors, are, used, in, parallel, as, the, independently, fluctuating, resistances, of, smaller, components, tend, to, average, out, while, not, an, example, of, noise, per, se, a, resistor, may, act, as, a, thermocouple, producing, a, small, dc, voltage, differential, across, it, due, to, the, thermoelectric, effect, if, its, ends, are, at, different, temperatures, this, induced, dc, voltage, can, degrade, the, precision, of, instrumentation, amplifiers, in, particular, such, voltages, appear, in, the, junctions, of, the, resistor, leads, with, the, circuit, board, and, with, the, resistor, body, common, metal, film, resistors, show, such, an, effect, at, a, magnitude, of, about, 20, v, c, some, carbon, composition, resistors, can, exhibit, thermoelectric, offsets, as, high, as, 400, v, c, whereas, specially, constructed, resistors, can, reduce, this, number, to, 0, 05, v, c, in, applications, where, the, thermoelectric, effect, may, become, important, care, has, to, be, taken, to, mount, the, resistors, horizontally, to, avoid, temperature, gradients, and, to, mind, the, air, flow, over, the, board, the, failure, rate, of, resistors, in, a, properly, designed, circuit, is, low, compared, to, other, electronic, components, such, as, semiconductors, and, electrolytic, capacitors, damage, to, resistors, most, often, occurs, due, to, overheating, when, the, average, power, delivered, to, it, greatly, exceeds, its, ability, to, dissipate, heat, specified, by, the, resistor, s, power, rating, this, may, be, due, to, a, fault, external, to, the, circuit, but, is, frequently, caused, by, the, failure, of, another, component, such, as, a, transistor, that, shorts, out, in, the, circuit, connected, to, the, resistor, operating, a, resistor, too, close, to, its, power, rating, can, limit, the, resistor, s, lifespan, or, cause, a, significant, change, in, its, resistance, a, safe, design, generally, uses, overrated, resistors, in, power, applications, to, avoid, this, danger, low, power, thin, film, resistors, can, be, damaged, by, long, term, high, voltage, stress, even, below, maximum, specified, voltage, and, below, maximum, power, rating, this, is, often, the, case, for, the, startup, resistors, feeding, a, switched, mode, power, supply, integrated, circuit, when, overheated, carbon, film, resistors, may, decrease, or, increase, in, resistance, carbon, film, and, composition, resistors, can, fail, open, circuit, if, running, close, to, their, maximum, dissipation, this, is, also, possible, but, less, likely, with, metal, film, and, wirewound, resistors, there, can, also, be, failure, of, resistors, due, to, mechanical, stress, and, adverse, environmental, factors, including, humidity, if, not, enclosed, wirewound, resistors, can, corrode, surface, mount, resistors, have, been, known, to, fail, due, to, the, ingress, of, sulfur, into, the, internal, makeup, of, the, resistor, this, sulfur, chemically, reacts, with, the, silver, layer, to, produce, non, conductive, silver, sulfide, the, resistor, s, impedance, goes, to, infinity, sulfur, resistant, and, anti, corrosive, resistors, are, sold, into, automotive, industrial, and, military, applications, astm, b809, is, an, industry, standard, that, tests, a, part, s, susceptibility, to, sulfur, an, alternative, failure, mode, can, be, encountered, where, large, value, resistors, are, used, hundreds, of, kilohms, and, higher, resistors, are, not, only, specified, with, a, maximum, power, dissipation, but, also, for, a, maximum, voltage, drop, exceeding, this, voltage, causes, the, resistor, to, degrade, slowly, reducing, in, resistance, the, voltage, dropped, across, large, value, resistors, can, be, exceeded, before, the, power, dissipation, reaches, its, limiting, value, since, the, maximum, voltage, specified, for, commonly, encountered, resistors, is, a, few, hundred, volts, this, is, a, problem, only, in, applications, where, these, voltages, are, encountered, variable, resistors, can, also, degrade, in, a, different, manner, typically, involving, poor, contact, between, the, wiper, and, the, body, of, the, resistance, this, may, be, due, to, dirt, or, corrosion, and, is, typically, perceived, as, crackling, as, the, contact, resistance, fluctuates, this, is, especially, noticed, as, the, device, is, adjusted, this, is, similar, to, crackling, caused, by, poor, contact, in, switches, and, like, switches, potentiometers, are, to, some, extent, self, cleaning, running, the, wiper, across, the, resistance, may, improve, the, contact, potentiometers, which, are, seldom, adjusted, especially, in, dirty, or, harsh, environments, are, most, likely, to, develop, this, problem, when, self, cleaning, of, the, contact, is, insufficient, improvement, can, usually, be, obtained, through, the, use, of, contact, cleaner, also, known, as, tuner, cleaner, spray, the, crackling, noise, associated, with, turning, the, shaft, of, a, dirty, potentiometer, in, an, audio, circuit, such, as, the, volume, control, is, greatly, accentuated, when, an, undesired, dc, voltage, is, present, often, indicating, the, failure, of, a, dc, blocking, capacitor, in, the, circuit
