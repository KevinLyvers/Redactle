a, clothes, dryer, tumble, dryer, drying, machine, or, simply, dryer, is, a, powered, household, appliance, that, is, used, to, remove, moisture, from, a, load, of, clothing, bedding, and, other, textiles, usually, after, they, are, washed, in, the, washing, machine, many, dryers, consist, of, a, rotating, drum, called, a, tumbler, through, which, heated, air, is, circulated, to, evaporate, moisture, while, the, tumbler, is, rotated, to, maintain, air, space, between, the, articles, using, such, a, machine, may, cause, clothes, to, shrink, or, become, less, soft, due, to, loss, of, short, soft, fibers, a, simpler, non, rotating, machine, called, a, drying, cabinet, may, be, used, for, delicate, fabrics, and, other, items, not, suitable, for, a, tumble, dryer, other, machines, include, steam, to, de, shrink, clothes, and, avoid, ironing, tumble, dryers, continuously, draw, in, the, ambient, air, around, them, and, heat, it, before, passing, it, through, the, tumbler, the, resulting, hot, humid, air, is, usually, vented, outside, to, make, room, for, more, air, to, continue, the, drying, process, tumble, dryers, are, sometimes, integrated, with, a, washing, machine, in, the, form, of, washer, dryer, combos, which, are, essentially, a, front, loading, washing, machine, with, an, integrated, dryer, or, in, the, us, a, laundry, center, which, stacks, the, dryer, on, top, of, the, washer, and, integrates, the, controls, for, both, machines, into, a, single, control, panel, often, the, washer, and, dryer, functions, will, have, a, different, capacity, with, the, dryer, usually, having, a, lower, capacity, than, the, washer, tumble, dryers, can, also, be, top, loading, in, which, the, drum, is, loaded, from, the, top, of, the, machine, and, the, drum, s, end, supports, are, in, the, left, and, right, sides, instead, of, the, more, conventional, front, and, rear, they, can, be, as, thin, as, 40, centimetres, 16, in, in, width, and, may, include, detachable, stationary, racks, for, drying, items, like, plush, toys, and, footwear, these, centrifuge, machines, simply, spin, their, drums, much, faster, than, a, typical, washer, could, in, order, to, extract, additional, water, from, the, load, they, may, remove, more, water, in, two, minutes, than, a, heated, tumbler, dryer, can, in, twenty, thus, saving, significant, amounts, of, time, and, energy, although, spinning, alone, will, not, completely, dry, clothing, this, additional, step, saves, a, worthwhile, amount, of, time, and, energy, for, large, laundry, operations, such, as, those, of, hospitals, just, as, in, a, tumble, dryer, condenser, or, condensation, dryers, pass, heated, air, through, the, load, however, instead, of, exhausting, this, air, the, dryer, uses, a, heat, exchanger, to, cool, the, air, and, condense, the, water, vapor, into, either, a, drain, pipe, or, a, collection, tank, the, drier, air, is, run, through, the, loop, again, the, heat, exchanger, typically, uses, ambient, air, as, its, coolant, therefore, the, heat, produced, by, the, dryer, will, go, into, the, immediate, surroundings, instead, of, the, outside, increasing, the, room, temperature, in, some, designs, cold, water, is, used, in, the, heat, exchanger, eliminating, this, heating, but, requiring, increased, water, usage, in, terms, of, energy, use, condenser, dryers, typically, require, around, 2, kilowatt, hours, kw, h, of, energy, per, average, load, because, the, heat, exchange, process, simply, cools, the, internal, air, using, ambient, air, or, cold, water, in, some, cases, it, will, not, dry, the, air, in, the, internal, loop, to, as, low, a, level, of, humidity, as, typical, fresh, ambient, air, as, a, consequence, of, the, increased, humidity, of, the, air, used, to, dry, the, load, this, type, of, dryer, requires, somewhat, more, time, than, a, tumble, dryer, condenser, dryers, are, a, particularly, attractive, option, where, long, intricate, ducting, would, be, required, to, vent, the, dryer, a, closed, cycle, heat, pump, clothes, dryer, uses, a, heat, pump, to, dehumidify, the, processing, air, such, dryers, typically, use, under, half, the, energy, per, load, of, a, condenser, dryer, whereas, condensation, dryers, use, a, passive, heat, exchanger, cooled, by, ambient, air, these, dryers, use, a, heat, pump, the, hot, humid, air, from, the, tumbler, is, passed, through, a, heat, pump, where, the, cold, side, condenses, the, water, vapor, into, either, a, drain, pipe, or, a, collection, tank, and, the, hot, side, reheats, the, air, afterward, for, re, use, in, this, way, not, only, does, the, dryer, avoid, the, need, for, ducting, but, it, also, conserves, much, of, its, heat, within, the, dryer, instead, of, exhausting, it, into, the, surroundings, heat, pump, dryers, can, therefore, use, up, to, 50, less, energy, required, by, either, condensation, or, conventional, electric, dryers, heat, pump, dryers, use, about, 1, kw, h, of, energy, to, dry, an, average, load, instead, of, 2, kw, h, for, a, condenser, dryer, or, from, 3, to, 9, kw, h, for, a, conventional, electric, dryer, domestic, heat, pump, dryers, are, designed, to, work, in, typical, ambient, temperatures, from, 5, to, 30, c, 41, to, 86, f, below, 5, c, 41, f, drying, times, significantly, increase, as, with, condensation, dryers, the, heat, exchanger, will, not, dry, the, internal, air, to, as, low, a, level, of, humidity, as, the, typical, ambient, air, with, respect, to, ambient, air, the, higher, humidity, of, the, air, used, to, dry, the, clothes, has, the, effect, of, increasing, drying, times, however, because, heat, pump, dryers, conserve, much, of, the, heat, of, the, air, they, use, the, already, hot, air, can, be, cycled, more, quickly, possibly, leading, to, shorter, drying, times, than, tumble, dryers, depending, on, the, model, a, new, type, of, dryer, in, development, these, machines, are, a, more, advanced, version, of, heat, pump, dryers, instead, of, using, hot, air, to, dry, the, clothing, mechanical, steam, compression, dryers, use, water, recovered, from, the, clothing, in, the, form, of, steam, first, the, tumbler, and, its, contents, are, heated, to, 100, c, 212, f, the, wet, steam, that, results, purges, the, system, of, air, and, is, the, only, remaining, atmosphere, in, the, tumbler, as, wet, steam, exits, the, tumbler, it, is, mechanically, compressed, hence, the, name, to, extract, water, vapor, and, transfer, the, heat, of, vaporization, to, the, remaining, gaseous, steam, this, pressurized, gaseous, steam, is, then, allowed, to, expand, and, is, superheated, before, being, injected, back, into, the, tumbler, where, its, heat, causes, more, water, to, vaporize, from, the, clothing, creating, more, wet, steam, and, restarting, the, cycle, like, heat, pump, dryers, mechanical, steam, compression, dryers, recycle, much, of, the, heat, used, to, dry, the, clothes, and, they, operate, in, a, very, similar, range, of, efficiency, as, heat, pump, dryers, both, types, can, be, over, twice, as, efficient, as, conventional, tumble, dryers, the, considerably, higher, temperatures, used, in, mechanical, steam, compression, dryers, result, in, drying, times, on, the, order, of, half, as, long, as, those, of, heat, pump, dryers, marketed, by, some, manufacturers, as, a, static, clothes, drying, technique, convectant, dryers, simply, consist, of, a, heating, unit, at, the, bottom, a, vertical, chamber, and, a, vent, at, top, the, unit, heats, air, at, the, bottom, reducing, its, relative, humidity, and, the, natural, tendency, of, hot, air, to, rise, brings, this, low, humidity, air, into, contact, with, the, clothes, this, design, is, slower, than, conventional, tumble, dryers, but, relatively, energy, efficient, if, well, implemented, it, works, particularly, well, in, cold, and, humid, environments, where, it, dries, clothes, substantially, faster, than, line, drying, in, hot, and, dry, weather, the, performance, delta, over, line, drying, is, negligible, given, that, this, is, a, relatively, simple, and, cheap, technique, to, materialize, most, consumer, products, showcase, the, added, benefit, of, portability, and, or, modularity, newer, designs, implement, a, fan, heater, at, the, bottom, to, pump, hot, air, into, the, vertical, drying, rack, chamber, temperatures, in, excess, of, 60, c, 140, f, can, be, reached, inside, these, hot, air, balloons, yet, lint, static, cling, and, shrinkage, are, minimal, upfront, cost, is, significantly, lower, than, tumble, condenser, and, heat, pump, designs, if, used, in, combination, with, washing, machines, featuring, fast, spin, cycles, 800, rpm, or, spin, dryers, the, cost, effectiveness, of, this, technique, has, the, potential, to, render, tumble, dryer, like, designs, obsolete, in, single, person, and, small, family, households, one, disadvantage, is, that, the, moisture, from, the, clothes, is, released, into, the, immediate, surroundings, proper, ventilation, or, a, complementary, dehumidifier, is, recommended, for, indoor, use, it, also, cannot, compete, with, the, tumble, dryer, s, capacity, to, dry, multiple, loads, of, wet, clothing, in, a, single, day, the, solar, dryer, is, a, box, shaped, stationary, construction, which, encloses, a, second, compartment, where, the, clothes, are, held, it, uses, the, sun, s, heat, without, direct, sunlight, reaching, the, clothes, alternatively, a, solar, heating, box, may, be, used, to, heat, air, that, is, driven, through, a, conventional, tumbler, dryer, japanese, manufacturers, have, developed, highly, efficient, clothes, dryers, that, use, microwave, radiation, to, dry, the, clothes, though, a, vast, majority, of, japanese, air, dry, their, laundry, most, of, the, drying, is, done, using, microwaves, to, evaporate, the, water, but, the, final, drying, is, done, by, convection, heating, to, avoid, problems, of, arcing, with, metal, pieces, in, the, laundry, there, are, a, number, of, advantages, shorter, drying, times, 25, less, energy, savings, 17, 25, less, and, lower, drying, temperatures, some, analysts, think, that, the, arcing, and, fabric, damage, is, a, factor, preventing, microwave, dryers, from, being, developed, for, the, us, market, ultrasonic, dryers, use, high, frequency, signals, to, drive, piezoelectric, actuators, in, order, to, mechanically, shake, the, clothes, releasing, water, in, the, form, of, a, mist, which, is, then, removed, from, the, drum, they, have, the, potential, to, significantly, cut, energy, consumption, while, needing, only, one, third, of, the, time, needed, by, a, conventional, electric, dryer, for, a, given, load, they, also, do, not, have, the, same, issues, related, with, lint, in, most, other, types, of, dryers, some, manufacturers, like, lg, electronics, and, whirlpool, have, introduced, hybrid, dryers, that, offer, the, user, the, option, of, using, either, a, heat, pump, or, a, traditional, electric, heating, element, for, drying, the, user, s, clothes, hybrid, dryers, can, also, use, a, heat, pump, and, a, heating, element, at, the, same, time, to, dry, clothes, faster, clothes, dryers, can, cause, static, cling, through, the, triboelectric, effect, this, can, be, a, minor, nuisance, and, is, often, a, symptom, of, over, drying, textiles, to, below, their, equilibrium, moisture, level, particularly, when, using, synthetic, materials, fabric, conditioning, products, such, as, dryer, sheets, are, marketed, to, dissipate, this, static, charge, depositing, surfactants, onto, the, fabric, load, by, mechanical, abrasion, during, tumbling, modern, dryers, often, have, improved, temperature, and, humidity, sensors, and, electronic, controls, which, aim, to, stop, the, drying, cycle, once, textiles, are, sufficiently, dry, avoiding, over, drying, and, the, static, charge, and, energy, wastage, this, causes, drying, at, a, minimum, of, 60, c, 140, f, heat, for, thirty, minutes, kills, many, parasites, including, house, dust, mites, bed, bugs, and, scabies, mites, and, their, eggs, a, bit, more, than, ten, minutes, kills, ticks, simply, washing, drowns, dust, mites, and, exposure, to, direct, sunlight, for, three, hours, kills, their, eggs, moisture, and, lint, are, byproducts, of, the, tumble, drying, process, and, are, pulled, from, the, drum, by, a, fan, motor, and, then, pushed, through, the, remaining, exhaust, conduit, to, the, exterior, termination, fitting, typical, exhaust, conduit, comprises, flex, transition, hose, found, immediately, behind, the, dryer, the, 4, inch, 100, mm, rigid, galvanized, pipe, and, elbow, fittings, found, within, the, wall, framing, and, the, vent, duct, hood, found, outside, the, house, a, clean, unobstructed, dryer, vent, improves, both, the, efficiency, and, safety, of, the, dryer, as, the, dryer, duct, pipe, becomes, partially, obstructed, and, filled, with, lint, drying, time, markedly, increases, and, causes, the, dryer, to, waste, energy, a, blocked, vent, increases, the, internal, temperature, and, may, result, in, a, fire, clothes, dryers, are, one, of, the, more, costly, home, appliances, to, operate, several, factors, can, contribute, to, or, accelerate, rapid, lint, build, up, these, include, long, or, restrictive, ducts, bird, or, rodent, nests, in, the, termination, crushed, or, kinked, flex, transition, hose, terminations, with, screen, like, features, and, condensation, within, the, duct, due, to, un, insulated, ducts, traveling, through, cold, spaces, such, as, a, crawl, space, or, attic, if, plastic, flaps, are, at, the, outside, end, of, the, duct, one, may, be, able, to, flex, bend, and, temporarily, remove, the, plastic, flaps, clean, the, inside, surface, of, the, flaps, clean, the, last, foot, or, so, of, the, duct, and, reattach, the, plastic, flaps, the, plastic, flaps, keep, insects, birds, and, snakes, out, of, the, dryer, vent, pipe, during, cold, weather, the, warm, wet, air, condenses, on, the, plastic, flaps, and, minor, trace, amounts, of, lint, sticks, to, the, wet, inside, part, of, the, plastic, flaps, at, the, outside, of, the, building, ventless, dryers, include, multi, stage, lint, filtration, systems, and, some, even, include, automatic, evaporator, and, condenser, cleaning, functions, that, can, run, even, while, the, dryer, is, running, the, evaporator, and, condenser, are, usually, cleaned, with, running, water, these, systems, are, necessary, in, order, to, prevent, lint, from, building, up, inside, the, dryer, and, evaporator, and, condenser, coils, aftermarket, add, on, lint, and, moisture, traps, can, be, attached, to, the, dryer, duct, pipe, on, machines, originally, manufactured, as, outside, venting, to, facilitate, installation, where, an, outside, vent, is, not, available, increased, humidity, at, the, location, of, installation, is, a, drawback, to, this, method, dryers, expose, flammable, materials, to, heat, underwriters, laboratories, recommends, cleaning, the, lint, filter, after, every, cycle, for, safety, and, energy, efficiency, provision, of, adequate, ventilation, and, cleaning, of, the, duct, at, regular, intervals, ul, also, recommends, that, dryers, not, be, used, for, glass, fiber, rubber, foam, or, plastic, items, or, any, item, that, has, had, a, flammable, substance, spilled, on, it, in, the, united, states, the, us, fire, administration, in, a, 2012, report, estimated, that, from, 2008, to, 2010, fire, departments, responded, to, an, estimated, 2, 900, clothes, dryer, fires, in, residential, buildings, each, year, across, the, nation, these, fires, resulted, in, an, annual, average, loss, of, 5, deaths, 100, injuries, and, 35, million, in, property, loss, the, fire, administration, attributes, failure, to, clean, 34, as, the, leading, factor, contributing, to, clothes, dryer, fires, in, residential, buildings, and, observed, that, new, home, construction, trends, place, clothes, dryers, and, washing, machines, in, more, hazardous, locations, away, from, outside, walls, such, as, in, bedrooms, second, floor, hallways, bathrooms, and, kitchens, to, address, the, problem, of, clothes, dryer, fires, a, fire, suppression, system, can, be, used, with, sensors, to, detect, the, change, in, temperature, when, a, blaze, starts, in, a, dryer, drum, these, sensors, then, activate, a, water, vapor, mechanism, to, put, out, the, fire, the, environmental, impact, of, clothes, dryers, is, especially, severe, in, the, us, and, canada, where, over, 80, of, all, homes, have, a, clothes, dryer, according, to, the, us, environmental, protection, agency, if, all, residential, clothes, dryers, sold, in, the, us, were, energy, efficient, the, utility, cost, savings, would, grow, to, more, than, 1, 5, billion, each, year, and, more, than, 10, billion, kilograms, 22, billion, pounds, of, annual, greenhouse, gas, emissions, would, be, prevented, clothes, dryers, are, second, only, to, refrigerators, and, freezers, as, the, largest, residential, electrical, energy, consumers, in, america, in, the, european, union, the, eu, energy, labeling, system, is, applied, to, dryers, dryers, are, classified, with, a, label, from, a, best, to, g, worst, according, to, the, amount, of, energy, used, per, kilogram, of, clothes, kw, h, kg, sensor, dryers, can, automatically, sense, that, clothes, are, dry, and, switch, off, this, means, over, drying, is, not, as, frequent, most, of, the, european, market, sells, sensor, dryers, now, and, they, are, normally, available, in, condenser, and, vented, dryers, a, hand, cranked, clothes, dryer, was, created, in, 1800, by, m, pochon, from, france, henry, w, altorfer, invented, and, patented, an, electric, clothes, dryer, in, 1937, j, ross, moore, an, inventor, from, north, dakota, developed, designs, for, automatic, clothes, dryers, and, published, his, design, for, an, electrically, operated, dryer, in, 1938, industrial, designer, brooks, stevens, developed, an, electric, dryer, with, a, glass, window, in, the, early, 1940s
