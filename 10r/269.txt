masonry, is, the, craft, of, building, a, structure, with, brick, stone, or, similar, material, including, mortar, plastering, which, are, often, laid, in, bound, and, pasted, together, by, mortar, the, term, masonry, can, also, refer, to, the, building, units, stone, brick, etc, themselves, the, common, materials, of, masonry, construction, are, bricks, and, building, stone, such, as, marble, granite, and, limestone, cast, stone, concrete, blocks, glass, blocks, and, adobe, masonry, is, generally, a, highly, durable, form, of, construction, however, the, materials, used, the, quality, of, the, mortar, and, workmanship, and, the, pattern, in, which, the, units, are, assembled, can, substantially, affect, the, durability, of, the, overall, masonry, construction, a, person, who, constructs, masonry, is, called, a, mason, or, bricklayer, these, are, both, classified, as, construction, trades, masonry, is, one, of, the, oldest, building, crafts, in, the, world, the, construction, of, egyptian, pyramids, roman, aqueducts, and, medieval, cathedrals, are, all, examples, of, masonry, early, structures, used, the, weight, of, the, masonry, itself, to, stabilize, the, structure, against, lateral, movements, the, types, and, techniques, of, masonry, used, evolved, with, architectural, needs, and, cultural, norms, since, mid, 20th, century, masonry, has, often, featured, steel, reinforced, elements, to, help, carry, the, tension, force, present, in, modern, thin, light, tall, building, systems, masonry, has, both, structural, and, non, structural, applications, structural, applications, include, walls, columns, beams, foundations, load, bearing, arches, and, others, on, the, other, hand, masonry, is, also, used, in, non, structural, applications, such, as, fireplaces, chimneys, and, veneer, systems, brick, and, concrete, block, are, the, most, common, types, of, masonry, in, use, in, industrialized, nations, and, may, be, either, load, bearing, or, non, load, bearing, concrete, blocks, especially, those, with, hollow, cores, offer, various, possibilities, in, masonry, construction, they, generally, provide, great, compressive, strength, and, are, best, suited, to, structures, with, light, transverse, loading, when, the, cores, remain, unfilled, filling, some, or, all, of, the, cores, with, concrete, or, concrete, with, steel, reinforcement, typically, rebar, offers, much, greater, tensile, and, lateral, strength, to, structures, one, problem, with, masonry, walls, is, that, they, rely, mainly, on, their, weight, to, keep, them, in, place, each, block, or, brick, is, only, loosely, connected, to, the, next, via, a, thin, layer, of, mortar, this, is, why, they, do, not, perform, well, in, earthquakes, when, entire, buildings, are, shaken, horizontally, many, collapses, during, earthquakes, occur, in, buildings, that, have, load, bearing, masonry, walls, besides, heavier, buildings, having, masonry, suffer, more, damage, the, strength, of, a, masonry, wall, is, not, entirely, dependent, on, the, bond, between, the, building, material, and, the, mortar, the, friction, between, the, interlocking, blocks, of, masonry, is, often, strong, enough, to, provide, a, great, deal, of, strength, on, its, own, the, blocks, sometimes, have, grooves, or, other, surface, features, added, to, enhance, this, interlocking, and, some, dry, set, masonry, structures, forgo, mortar, altogether, stone, blocks, used, in, masonry, can, be, dressed, or, rough, though, in, both, examples, corners, door, and, window, jambs, and, similar, areas, are, usually, dressed, stonemasonry, utilizing, dressed, stones, is, known, as, ashlar, masonry, whereas, masonry, using, irregularly, shaped, stones, is, known, as, rubble, masonry, both, rubble, and, ashlar, masonry, can, be, laid, in, coursed, rows, of, even, height, through, the, careful, selection, or, cutting, of, stones, but, a, great, deal, of, stone, masonry, is, uncoursed, solid, brickwork, is, made, of, two, or, more, wythes, of, bricks, with, the, units, running, horizontally, called, stretcher, bricks, bound, together, with, bricks, running, transverse, to, the, wall, called, header, bricks, each, row, of, bricks, is, known, as, a, course, the, pattern, of, headers, and, stretchers, employed, gives, rise, to, different, bonds, such, as, the, common, bond, with, every, sixth, course, composed, of, headers, the, english, bond, and, the, flemish, bond, with, alternating, stretcher, and, header, bricks, present, on, every, course, bonds, can, differ, in, strength, and, in, insulating, ability, vertically, staggered, bonds, tend, to, be, somewhat, stronger, and, less, prone, to, major, cracking, than, a, non, staggered, bond, the, wide, selection, of, brick, styles, and, types, generally, available, in, industrialized, nations, allow, much, variety, in, the, appearance, of, the, final, product, in, buildings, built, during, the, 1950s, 1970s, a, high, degree, of, uniformity, of, brick, and, accuracy, in, masonry, was, typical, in, the, period, since, then, this, style, was, thought, to, be, too, sterile, so, attempts, were, made, to, emulate, older, rougher, work, some, brick, surfaces, are, made, to, look, particularly, rustic, by, including, burnt, bricks, which, have, a, darker, color, or, an, irregular, shape, others, may, use, antique, salvage, bricks, or, new, bricks, may, be, artificially, aged, by, applying, various, surface, treatments, such, as, tumbling, the, attempts, at, rusticity, of, the, late, 20th, century, have, been, carried, forward, by, masons, specializing, in, a, free, artistic, style, where, the, courses, are, intentionally, not, straight, instead, weaving, to, form, more, organic, impressions, a, crinkle, crankle, wall, is, a, brick, wall, that, follows, a, serpentine, path, rather, than, a, straight, line, this, type, of, wall, is, more, resistant, to, toppling, than, a, straight, wall, so, much, so, that, it, may, be, made, of, a, single, wythe, of, unreinforced, brick, and, so, despite, its, longer, length, may, be, more, economical, than, a, straight, wall, blocks, of, cinder, concrete, cinder, blocks, or, breezeblocks, ordinary, concrete, concrete, blocks, or, hollow, tile, are, generically, known, as, concrete, masonry, units, cmus, they, usually, are, much, larger, than, ordinary, bricks, and, so, are, much, faster, to, lay, for, a, wall, of, a, given, size, furthermore, cinder, and, concrete, blocks, typically, have, much, lower, water, absorption, rates, than, brick, they, often, are, used, as, the, structural, core, for, veneered, brick, masonry, or, are, used, alone, for, the, walls, of, factories, garages, and, other, industrial, style, buildings, where, such, appearance, is, acceptable, or, desirable, such, blocks, often, receive, a, stucco, surface, for, decoration, surface, bonding, cement, which, contains, synthetic, fibers, for, reinforcement, is, sometimes, used, in, this, application, and, can, impart, extra, strength, to, a, block, wall, surface, bonding, cement, is, often, pre, colored, and, can, be, stained, or, painted, thus, resulting, in, a, finished, stucco, like, surface, the, primary, structural, advantage, of, concrete, blocks, in, comparison, to, smaller, clay, based, bricks, is, that, a, cmu, wall, can, be, reinforced, by, filling, the, block, voids, with, concrete, with, or, without, steel, rebar, generally, certain, voids, are, designated, for, filling, and, reinforcement, particularly, at, corners, wall, ends, and, openings, while, other, voids, are, left, empty, this, increases, wall, strength, and, stability, more, economically, than, filling, and, reinforcing, all, voids, typically, structures, made, of, cmus, will, have, the, top, course, of, blocks, in, the, walls, filled, with, concrete, and, tied, together, with, steel, reinforcement, to, form, a, bond, beam, bond, beams, are, often, a, requirement, of, modern, building, codes, and, controls, another, type, of, steel, reinforcement, referred, to, as, ladder, reinforcement, can, also, be, embedded, in, horizontal, mortar, joints, of, concrete, block, walls, the, introduction, of, steel, reinforcement, generally, results, in, a, cmu, wall, having, much, greater, lateral, and, tensile, strength, than, unreinforced, walls, architectural, masonry, is, the, evolvement, of, standard, concrete, masonry, blocks, into, aesthetically, pleasing, concrete, masonry, units, cmus, cmus, can, be, manufactured, to, provide, a, variety, of, surface, appearances, they, can, be, colored, during, manufacturing, or, stained, or, painted, after, installation, they, can, be, split, as, part, of, the, manufacturing, process, giving, the, blocks, a, rough, face, replicating, the, appearance, of, natural, stone, such, as, brownstone, cmus, may, also, be, scored, ribbed, sandblasted, polished, striated, raked, or, brushed, include, decorative, aggregates, be, allowed, to, slump, in, a, controlled, fashion, during, curing, or, include, several, of, these, techniques, in, their, manufacture, to, provide, a, decorative, appearance, glazed, concrete, masonry, units, are, manufactured, by, bonding, a, permanent, colored, facing, typically, composed, of, polyester, resins, silica, sand, and, various, other, chemicals, to, a, concrete, masonry, unit, providing, a, smooth, impervious, surface, glass, block, or, glass, brick, are, blocks, made, from, glass, and, provide, a, translucent, to, clear, vision, through, the, block, a, masonry, veneer, wall, consists, of, masonry, units, usually, clay, based, bricks, installed, on, one, or, both, sides, of, a, structurally, independent, wall, usually, constructed, of, wood, or, masonry, in, this, context, the, brick, masonry, is, primarily, decorative, not, structural, the, brick, veneer, is, generally, connected, to, the, structural, wall, by, brick, ties, metal, strips, that, are, attached, to, the, structural, wall, as, well, as, the, mortar, joints, of, the, brick, veneer, there, is, typically, an, air, gap, between, the, brick, veneer, and, the, structural, wall, as, clay, based, brick, is, usually, not, completely, waterproof, the, structural, wall, will, often, have, a, water, resistant, surface, usually, tar, paper, and, weep, holes, can, be, left, at, the, base, of, the, brick, veneer, to, drain, moisture, that, accumulates, inside, the, air, gap, concrete, blocks, real, and, cultured, stones, and, veneer, adobe, are, sometimes, used, in, a, very, similar, veneer, fashion, most, insulated, buildings, that, use, concrete, block, brick, adobe, stone, veneers, or, some, combination, thereof, feature, interior, insulation, in, the, form, of, fiberglass, batts, between, wooden, wall, studs, or, in, the, form, of, rigid, insulation, boards, covered, with, plaster, or, drywall, in, most, climates, this, insulation, is, much, more, effective, on, the, exterior, of, the, wall, allowing, the, building, interior, to, take, advantage, of, the, aforementioned, thermal, mass, of, the, masonry, this, technique, does, however, require, some, sort, of, weather, resistant, exterior, surface, over, the, insulation, and, consequently, is, generally, more, expensive, gabions, are, baskets, usually, now, of, zinc, protected, steel, galvanized, steel, that, are, filled, with, fractured, stone, of, medium, size, these, will, act, as, a, single, unit, and, are, stacked, with, setbacks, to, form, a, revetment, or, retaining, wall, they, have, the, advantage, of, being, well, drained, flexible, and, resistant, to, flood, water, flow, from, above, frost, damage, and, soil, flow, their, expected, useful, life, is, only, as, long, as, the, wire, they, are, composed, of, and, if, used, in, severe, climates, such, as, shore, side, in, a, salt, water, environment, must, be, made, of, appropriate, corrosion, resistant, wire, most, modern, gabions, are, rectangular, earlier, gabions, were, often, cylindrical, wicker, baskets, open, at, both, ends, used, usually, for, temporary, often, military, construction, similar, work, can, be, done, with, finer, aggregates, using, cellular, confinement, masonry, walls, have, an, endothermic, effect, of, its, hydrates, as, in, chemically, bound, water, unbound, moisture, from, the, concrete, block, and, the, poured, concrete, if, the, hollow, cores, inside, the, blocks, are, filled, masonry, can, withstand, temperatures, up, to, 1, 000, f, 538, c, and, it, can, withstand, direct, exposure, to, fire, for, up, to, 4, hours, in, addition, to, that, concrete, masonry, keeps, fires, contained, to, their, room, of, origin, 93, of, the, time, for, those, reasons, concrete, and, masonry, units, hold, the, highest, flame, spread, index, classification, class, a, fire, cuts, can, be, used, to, increase, safety, and, reduce, fire, damage, to, masonry, buildings, from, the, point, of, view, of, material, modeling, masonry, is, a, special, material, of, extreme, mechanical, properties, with, a, very, high, ratio, between, strength, in, compression, and, in, tension, so, that, the, applied, loads, do, not, diffuse, as, they, do, in, elastic, bodies, but, tend, to, percolate, along, lines, of, high, stiffness
