felt, is, a, textile, that, is, produced, by, matting, condensing, and, pressing, fibers, together, felt, can, be, made, of, natural, fibers, such, as, wool, or, animal, fur, or, from, synthetic, fibers, such, as, petroleum, based, acrylic, or, acrylonitrile, or, wood, pulp, based, rayon, blended, fibers, are, also, common, natural, fiber, felt, has, special, properties, that, allow, it, to, be, used, for, a, wide, variety, of, purposes, it, is, fire, retardant, and, self, extinguishing, it, dampens, vibration, and, absorbs, sound, and, it, can, hold, large, amounts, of, fluid, without, feeling, wet, 10, felt, from, wool, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, textiles, many, cultures, have, legends, about, the, origins, of, felt, making, sumerian, legend, claims, that, the, secret, of, feltmaking, was, discovered, by, urnamman, of, lagash, the, story, of, saint, clement, and, saint, christopher, relates, that, the, men, packed, their, sandals, with, wool, to, prevent, blisters, while, fleeing, from, persecution, at, the, end, of, their, journey, the, movement, and, sweat, had, turned, the, wool, into, felt, socks, most, likely, felt, s, origins, can, be, found, in, central, asia, where, there, is, evidence, of, feltmaking, in, siberia, altai, mountains, in, northern, mongolia, and, more, recently, evidence, dating, back, to, the, first, century, ce, in, mongolia, siberian, tombs, 7th, to, 2nd, century, bce, show, the, broad, uses, of, felt, in, that, culture, including, clothing, jewelry, wall, hangings, and, elaborate, horse, blankets, employing, careful, color, use, stitching, and, other, techniques, these, feltmakers, were, able, to, use, felt, as, an, illustrative, and, decorative, medium, on, which, they, could, depict, abstract, designs, and, realistic, scenes, with, great, skill, over, time, these, makers, became, known, for, the, beautiful, abstract, patterns, they, used, that, were, derived, from, plant, animal, and, other, symbolic, designs, 21, from, siberia, and, mongolia, feltmaking, spread, across, the, areas, held, by, the, turkic, mongolian, tribes, sheep, and, camel, herds, were, central, to, the, wealth, and, lifestyle, of, these, tribes, both, of, which, animals, were, critical, to, producing, the, fibers, needed, for, felting, for, nomads, traveling, frequently, and, living, on, fairly, treeless, plains, felt, provided, housing, yurts, tents, etc, insulation, floor, coverings, and, inside, walling, as, well, as, many, household, necessities, from, bedding, and, coverings, to, clothing, in, the, case, of, nomadic, peoples, an, area, where, feltmaking, was, particularly, visible, was, in, trappings, for, their, animals, and, for, travel, felt, was, often, featured, in, the, blankets, that, went, under, saddles, dyes, provided, rich, coloring, and, colored, slices, of, pre, felts, semi, felted, sheets, that, could, be, cut, in, decorative, ways, along, with, dyed, yarns, and, threads, were, combined, to, create, beautiful, designs, on, the, wool, backgrounds, felt, was, even, used, to, create, totems, and, amulets, with, protective, functions, in, traditional, societies, the, patterns, embedded, in, the, felt, were, also, imbued, with, significant, religious, and, symbolic, meaning, 21, 23, feltmaking, is, still, practised, by, nomadic, peoples, such, as, mongols, and, turkic, people, in, central, asia, where, rugs, tents, and, clothing, are, regularly, made, some, of, these, are, traditional, items, such, as, the, classic, yurt, or, ger, while, others, are, designed, for, the, tourist, market, such, as, decorated, slippers, in, the, western, world, felt, is, widely, used, as, a, medium, for, expression, in, both, textile, art, and, contemporary, art, and, design, where, it, has, significance, as, an, ecologically, responsible, textile, and, building, material, in, addition, to, central, asian, traditions, of, felting, scandinavian, countries, have, also, supported, feltmaking, particularly, for, clothing, in, the, wet, felting, process, hot, water, is, applied, to, layers, of, animal, hairs, while, repeated, agitation, and, compression, causes, the, fibers, to, hook, together, or, weave, together, into, a, single, piece, of, fabric, wrapping, the, properly, arranged, fiber, in, a, sturdy, textured, material, such, as, a, bamboo, mat, or, burlap, will, speed, up, the, felting, process, the, felted, material, may, be, finished, by, fulling, only, certain, types, of, fiber, can, be, wet, felted, successfully, most, types, of, fleece, such, as, those, taken, from, the, alpaca, or, the, merino, sheep, can, be, put, through, the, wet, felting, process, one, may, also, use, mohair, goat, angora, rabbit, or, hair, from, rodents, such, as, beavers, and, muskrats, these, types, of, fiber, are, covered, in, tiny, scales, similar, to, the, scales, found, on, a, strand, of, human, hair, heat, motion, and, moisture, of, the, fleece, causes, the, scales, to, open, while, agitating, them, causes, them, to, latch, onto, each, other, creating, felt, there, is, an, alternative, theory, that, the, fibers, wind, around, each, other, during, felting, plant, fibers, and, synthetic, fibers, will, not, wet, felt, in, order, to, make, multi, colored, designs, felters, conduct, a, two, step, process, in, which, they, create, pre, felts, of, specialized, colors, these, semi, completed, sheets, of, colored, felt, can, then, be, cut, with, a, sharp, implement, knife, or, scissors, and, the, distinctive, colors, placed, next, to, each, other, as, in, making, a, mosaic, the, felting, process, is, then, resumed, and, the, edges, of, the, fabric, attach, to, each, other, as, the, felting, process, is, completed, shyrdak, carpets, turkmenistan, use, a, form, of, this, method, wherein, two, pieces, of, contrasting, color, are, cut, out, with, the, same, pattern, the, cut, outs, are, then, switched, fitting, one, into, the, other, which, makes, a, sharply, defined, and, colorful, patterned, piece, in, order, to, strengthen, the, joints, of, a, mosaic, style, felt, feltmakers, often, add, a, backing, layer, of, fleece, that, is, felted, along, with, the, other, components, feltmakers, can, differ, in, their, orientation, to, this, added, layer, where, some, will, lay, it, on, top, of, the, design, before, felting, and, others, will, place, the, design, on, top, of, the, strengthening, layer, 29, the, process, of, felting, was, adapted, to, the, lifestyles, of, the, different, cultures, in, which, it, flourished, in, central, asia, it, is, common, to, conduct, the, rolling, friction, process, with, the, aid, of, a, horse, donkey, or, camel, which, will, pull, the, rolled, felt, until, the, process, is, complete, alternately, a, group, of, people, in, a, line, might, roll, the, felt, along, kicking, it, regularly, with, their, feet, further, fulling, can, include, throwing, or, slamming, and, working, the, edges, with, careful, rolling, 26, in, turkey, some, baths, had, areas, dedicated, to, feltmaking, making, use, of, the, steam, and, hot, water, that, were, already, present, for, bathing, 37, as, felting, grew, in, importance, to, a, society, so, too, did, the, knowledge, about, techniques, and, approaches, amateur, or, community, felting, obviously, continued, in, many, communities, at, the, same, time, that, felting, specialists, and, felting, centers, began, to, develop, however, the, importance, of, felting, to, community, life, can, be, seen, in, the, fact, that, in, many, central, asian, communities, felt, production, is, directed, by, a, leader, who, oversees, the, process, as, a, ritual, that, includes, prayers, words, and, actions, to, bring, good, luck, to, the, process, successfully, completing, the, creation, of, felt, certainly, large, felt, pieces, is, reason, for, celebration, feasting, and, the, sharing, of, traditional, stories, 38, 40, in, turkey, craft, guilds, called, ahi, came, into, being, and, these, groups, were, responsible, for, registering, members, and, protecting, the, knowledge, of, felting, in, istanbul, at, one, time, there, were, 1, 000, felters, working, in, 400, workshops, registered, in, this, ahi, 33, needle, felting, is, a, method, of, creating, felt, that, uses, specially, designed, needles, instead, of, water, felting, needles, have, angled, notches, along, the, shaft, that, catch, fibers, and, tangle, them, together, to, produce, felt, these, notches, are, sometimes, erroneously, called, barbs, but, barbs, are, protrusions, like, barbed, wire, and, would, be, too, difficult, to, thrust, into, the, wool, and, nearly, impossible, to, pull, out, felting, needles, are, thin, and, sharp, with, shafts, of, a, variety, of, different, gauges, and, shapes, needle, felting, is, used, in, industrial, felt, making, as, well, as, for, individual, art, and, craft, applications, felting, needles, are, sometimes, fitted, in, holders, that, allow, the, use, of, 2, or, more, needles, at, one, time, to, sculpt, wool, objects, and, shapes, individual, needles, are, often, used, for, detail, while, multiple, needles, that, are, paired, together, are, used, for, larger, areas, or, to, form, the, base, of, the, project, at, any, point, in, time, a, variety, of, fibers, and, fiber, colors, may, be, added, using, needles, to, incorporate, them, into, the, project, needle, felting, can, be, used, to, create, both, 2, dimensional, and, 3, dimensional, artwork, including, soft, sculpture, dolls, figurines, jewelry, and, 2, dimensional, wool, paintings, needle, felting, is, popular, with, artists, and, craftspeople, worldwide, one, example, is, ikuyo, fujita, fujita, ikuyo, a, japanese, artist, who, works, primarily, in, needle, felt, painting, and, mogol, pipe, cleaner, art, recently, needle, felting, machines, have, become, popular, for, art, or, craft, felters, similar, to, a, sewing, machine, these, tools, have, several, needles, that, punch, fibers, together, these, machines, can, be, used, to, create, felted, products, more, efficiently, the, embellishment, machine, allows, the, user, to, create, unique, combinations, of, fibers, and, designs, invented, in, the, mid, 17th, century, and, used, until, the, mid, 20th, centuries, a, process, called, carroting, was, used, in, the, manufacture, of, good, quality, felt, for, making, men, s, hats, beaver, rabbit, or, hare, skins, were, treated, with, a, dilute, solution, of, the, mercury, compound, mercuric, nitrate, the, skins, were, dried, in, an, oven, where, the, thin, fur, at, the, sides, turned, orange, the, color, of, carrots, pelts, were, stretched, over, a, bar, in, a, cutting, machine, and, the, skin, was, sliced, off, in, thin, shreds, with, the, fleece, coming, away, entirely, the, fur, was, blown, onto, a, cone, shaped, colander, and, then, treated, with, hot, water, to, consolidate, it, the, cone, then, peeled, off, and, passed, through, wet, rollers, to, cause, the, fur, to, felt, these, hoods, were, then, dyed, and, blocked, to, make, hats, the, toxic, solutions, from, the, carrot, and, the, vapours, it, produced, resulted, in, widespread, cases, of, mercury, poisoning, among, hatters, this, may, be, the, origin, of, the, phrase, mad, as, a, hatter, which, was, used, to, humorous, effect, by, lewis, carroll, in, the, chapter, a, mad, tea, party, of, the, novel, alice, in, wonderland, felt, is, used, in, a, wide, range, of, industries, and, manufacturing, processes, from, the, automotive, industry, and, casinos, to, musical, instruments, and, home, construction, as, well, as, in, gun, wadding, either, inside, cartridges, or, pushed, down, the, barrel, of, a, muzzleloader, felt, had, many, uses, in, ancient, times, and, continues, to, be, widely, used, today, felt, is, frequently, used, in, industry, as, a, sound, or, vibration, damper, as, a, non, woven, fabric, for, air, filtration, and, in, machinery, for, cushioning, and, padding, moving, parts, felt, can, be, used, in, home, furnishings, like, table, runners, placemats, coasters, and, even, as, backing, for, area, rugs, it, can, add, a, touch, of, warmth, and, texture, to, a, space, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, gentlemen, s, headwear, made, from, beaver, felt, were, popular, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, cloth, felt, hats, such, as, fedoras, trilbies, and, homburgs, were, worn, by, many, men, in, the, western, world, felt, is, often, used, in, footwear, as, boot, liners,

a, wooden, core, the, density, and, springiness, of, the, felt, is, a, major, part, of, what, creates, a, piano, s, tone, as, the, felt, becomes, grooved, and, packed, with, use, and, age, the, tone, suffers, felt, is, placed, under, the, piano, keys, on, accordions, to, control, touch, and, key, noise, it, is, also, used, on, the, pallets, to, silence, notes, not, sounded, by, preventing, air,
