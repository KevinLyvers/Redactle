a, telescope, is, a, device, used, to, observe, distant, objects, by, their, emission, absorption, or, reflection, of, electromagnetic, radiation, originally, it, was, an, optical, instrument, using, lenses, curved, mirrors, or, a, combination, of, both, to, observe, distant, objects, an, optical, telescope, nowadays, the, word, telescope, is, defined, as, a, wide, range, of, instruments, capable, of, detecting, different, regions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, in, some, cases, other, types, of, detectors, the, first, known, practical, telescopes, were, refracting, telescopes, with, glass, lenses, and, were, invented, in, the, netherlands, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, they, were, used, for, both, terrestrial, applications, and, astronomy, the, reflecting, telescope, which, uses, mirrors, to, collect, and, focus, light, was, invented, within, a, few, decades, of, the, first, refracting, telescope, in, the, 20th, century, many, new, types, of, telescopes, were, invented, including, radio, telescopes, in, the, 1930s, and, infrared, telescopes, in, the, 1960s, the, word, telescope, was, coined, in, 1611, by, the, greek, mathematician, giovanni, demisiani, for, one, of, galileo, galilei, s, instruments, presented, at, a, banquet, at, the, accademia, dei, lincei, in, the, starry, messenger, galileo, had, used, the, latin, term, perspicillum, the, root, of, the, word, is, from, the, ancient, greek, romanized, tele, far, and, skopein, to, look, or, see, teleskopos, far, seeing, the, earliest, existing, record, of, a, telescope, was, a, 1608, patent, submitted, to, the, government, in, the, netherlands, by, middelburg, spectacle, maker, hans, lipperhey, for, a, refracting, telescope, the, actual, inventor, is, unknown, but, word, of, it, spread, through, europe, galileo, heard, about, it, and, in, 1609, built, his, own, version, and, made, his, telescopic, observations, of, celestial, objects, the, idea, that, the, objective, or, light, gathering, element, could, be, a, mirror, instead, of, a, lens, was, being, investigated, soon, after, the, invention, of, the, refracting, telescope, the, potential, advantages, of, using, parabolic, mirrors, reduction, of, spherical, aberration, and, no, chromatic, aberration, led, to, many, proposed, designs, and, several, attempts, to, build, reflecting, telescopes, in, 1668, isaac, newton, built, the, first, practical, reflecting, telescope, of, a, design, which, now, bears, his, name, the, newtonian, reflector, the, invention, of, the, achromatic, lens, in, 1733, partially, corrected, color, aberrations, present, in, the, simple, lens, and, enabled, the, construction, of, shorter, more, functional, refracting, telescopes, reflecting, telescopes, though, not, limited, by, the, color, problems, seen, in, refractors, were, hampered, by, the, use, of, fast, tarnishing, speculum, metal, mirrors, employed, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, a, problem, alleviated, by, the, introduction, of, silver, coated, glass, mirrors, in, 1857, and, aluminized, mirrors, in, 1932, the, maximum, physical, size, limit, for, refracting, telescopes, is, about, 1, meter, 39, inches, dictating, that, the, vast, majority, of, large, optical, researching, telescopes, built, since, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, have, been, reflectors, the, largest, reflecting, telescopes, currently, have, objectives, larger, than, 10, meters, 33, feet, and, work, is, underway, on, several, 30, 40m, designs, the, 20th, century, also, saw, the, development, of, telescopes, that, worked, in, a, wide, range, of, wavelengths, from, radio, to, gamma, rays, the, first, purpose, built, radio, telescope, went, into, operation, in, 1937, since, then, a, large, variety, of, complex, astronomical, instruments, have, been, developed, since, the, atmosphere, is, opaque, for, most, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, only, a, few, bands, can, be, observed, from, the, earth, s, surface, these, bands, are, visible, near, infrared, and, a, portion, of, the, radio, wave, part, of, the, spectrum, for, this, reason, there, are, no, x, ray, or, far, infrared, ground, based, telescopes, as, these, have, to, be, observed, from, orbit, even, if, a, wavelength, is, observable, from, the, ground, it, might, still, be, advantageous, to, place, a, telescope, on, a, satellite, due, to, issues, such, as, clouds, astronomical, seeing, and, light, pollution, the, disadvantages, of, launching, a, space, telescope, include, cost, size, maintainability, and, upgradability, some, examples, of, space, telescopes, from, nasa, are, the, hubble, space, telescope, that, detects, visible, light, ultraviolet, and, near, infrared, wavelengths, the, spitzer, space, telescope, that, detects, infrared, radiation, and, the, kepler, space, telescope, that, discovered, thousands, of, exoplanets, the, latest, telescope, that, was, launched, was, the, james, webb, space, telescope, on, december, 25, 2021, in, kourou, french, guiana, the, webb, telescope, detects, infrared, light, the, name, telescope, covers, a, wide, range, of, instruments, most, detect, electromagnetic, radiation, but, there, are, major, differences, in, how, astronomers, must, go, about, collecting, light, electromagnetic, radiation, in, different, frequency, bands, as, wavelengths, become, longer, it, becomes, easier, to, use, antenna, technology, to, interact, with, electromagnetic, radiation, although, it, is, possible, to, make, very, tiny, antenna, the, near, infrared, can, be, collected, much, like, visible, light, however, in, the, far, infrared, and, submillimetre, range, telescopes, can, operate, more, like, a, radio, telescope, for, example, the, james, clerk, maxwell, telescope, observes, from, wavelengths, from, 3, m, 0, 003, mm, to, 2000, m, 2, mm, but, uses, a, parabolic, aluminum, antenna, on, the, other, hand, the, spitzer, space, telescope, observing, from, about, 3, m, 0, 003, mm, to, 180, m, 0, 18, mm, uses, a, mirror, reflecting, optics, also, using, reflecting, optics, the, hubble, space, telescope, with, wide, field, camera, 3, can, observe, in, the, frequency, range, from, about, 0, 2, m, 0, 0002, mm, to, 1, 7, m, 0, 0017, mm, from, ultra, violet, to, infrared, light, with, photons, of, the, shorter, wavelengths, with, the, higher, frequencies, glancing, incident, optics, rather, than, fully, reflecting, optics, are, used, telescopes, such, as, trace, and, soho, use, special, mirrors, to, reflect, extreme, ultraviolet, producing, higher, resolution, and, brighter, images, than, are, otherwise, possible, a, larger, aperture, does, not, just, mean, that, more, light, is, collected, it, also, enables, a, finer, angular, resolution, telescopes, may, also, be, classified, by, location, ground, telescope, space, telescope, or, flying, telescope, they, may, also, be, classified, by, whether, they, are, operated, by, professional, astronomers, or, amateur, astronomers, a, vehicle, or, permanent, campus, containing, one, or, more, telescopes, or, other, instruments, is, called, an, observatory, radio, telescopes, are, directional, radio, antennas, that, typically, employ, a, large, dish, to, collect, radio, waves, the, dishes, are, sometimes, constructed, of, a, conductive, wire, mesh, whose, openings, are, smaller, than, the, wavelength, being, observed, unlike, an, optical, telescope, which, produces, a, magnified, image, of, the, patch, of, sky, being, observed, a, traditional, radio, telescope, dish, contains, a, single, receiver, and, records, a, single, time, varying, signal, characteristic, of, the, observed, region, this, signal, may, be, sampled, at, various, frequencies, in, some, newer, radio, telescope, designs, a, single, dish, contains, an, array, of, several, receivers, this, is, known, as, a, focal, plane, array, by, collecting, and, correlating, signals, simultaneously, received, by, several, dishes, high, resolution, images, can, be, computed, such, multi, dish, arrays, are, known, as, astronomical, interferometers, and, the, technique, is, called, aperture, synthesis, the, virtual, apertures, of, these, arrays, are, similar, in, size, to, the, distance, between, the, telescopes, as, of, 2005, the, record, array, size, is, many, times, the, diameter, of, the, earth, using, space, based, very, long, baseline, interferometry, vlbi, telescopes, such, as, the, japanese, halca, highly, advanced, laboratory, for, communications, and, astronomy, vsop, vlbi, space, observatory, program, satellite, aperture, synthesis, is, now, also, being, applied, to, optical, telescopes, using, optical, interferometers, arrays, of, optical, telescopes, and, aperture, masking, interferometry, at, single, reflecting, telescopes, radio, telescopes, are, also, used, to, collect, microwave, radiation, which, has, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, pass, through, the, atmosphere, and, interstellar, gas, and, dust, clouds, some, radio, telescopes, such, as, the, allen, telescope, array, are, used, by, programs, such, as, seti, and, the, arecibo, observatory, to, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, an, optical, telescope, gathers, and, focuses, light, mainly, from, the, visible, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, optical, telescopes, increase, the, apparent, angular, size, of, distant, objects, as, well, as, their, apparent, brightness, for, the, image, to, be, observed, photographed, studied, and, sent, to, a, computer, telescopes, work, by, employing, one, or, more, curved, optical, elements, usually, made, from, glass, lenses, and, or, mirrors, to, gather, light, and, other, electromagnetic, radiation, to, bring, that, light, or, radiation, to, a, focal, point, optical, telescopes, are, used, for, astronomy, and, in, many, non, astronomical, instruments, including, theodolites, including, transits, spotting, scopes, monoculars, binoculars, camera, lenses, and, spyglasses, there, are, three, main, optical, types, a, fresnel, imager, is, a, proposed, ultra, lightweight, design, for, a, space, telescope, that, uses, a, fresnel, lens, to, focus, light, beyond, these, basic, optical, types, there, are, many, sub, types, of, varying, optical, design, classified, by, the, task, they, perform, such, as, astrographs, comet, seekers, and, solar, telescopes, most, ultraviolet, light, is, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, so, observations, at, these, wavelengths, must, be, performed, from, the, upper, atmosphere, or, from, space, x, rays, are, much, harder, to, collect, and, focus, than, electromagnetic, radiation, of, longer, wavelengths, x, ray, telescopes, can, use, x, ray, optics, such, as, wolter, telescopes, composed, of, ring, shaped, glancing, mirrors, made, of, heavy, metals, that, are, able, to, reflect, the, rays, just, a, few, degrees, the, mirrors, are, usually, a, section, of, a, rotated, parabola, and, a, hyperbola, or, ellipse, in, 1952, hans, wolter, outlined, 3, ways, a, telescope, could, be, built, using, only, this, kind, of, mirror, examples, of, space, observatories, using, this, type, of, telescope, are, the, einstein, observatory, rosat, and, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, in, 2012, the, nustar, x, ray, telescope, was, launched, which, uses, wolter, telescope, design, optics, at, the, end, of, a, long, deployable, mast, to, enable, photon, energies, of, 79, kev, higher, energy, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, telescopes, refrain, from, focusing, completely, and, use, coded, aperture, masks, the, patterns, of, the, shadow, the, mask, creates, can, be, reconstructed, to, form, an, image, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, telescopes, are, usually, installed, on, high, flying, balloons, or, earth, orbiting, satellites, since, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, opaque, to, this, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, an, example, of, this, type, of, telescope, is, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, which, was, launched, in, june, 2008, the, detection, of, very, high, energy, gamma, rays, with, shorter, wavelength, and, higher, frequency, than, regular, gamma, rays, requires, further, specialization, such, detections, can, be, made, either, with, the, imaging, atmospheric, cherenkov, telescopes, iacts, or, with, water, cherenkov, detectors, wcds, examples, of, iacts, are, h, e, s, s, and, veritas, with, the, next, generation, gamma, ray, telescope, cta, currently, under, construction, hawc, and, lhaaso, are, examples, of, gamma, ray, detectors, based, on, the, water, cherenkov, detectors, a, discovery, in, 2012, may, allow, focusing, gamma, ray, telescopes, at, photon, energies, greater, than, 700, kev, the, index, of, refraction, starts, to, increase, again
