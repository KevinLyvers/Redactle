computing, is, any, goal, oriented, activity, requiring, benefiting, from, or, creating, computing, machinery, it, includes, the, study, and, experimentation, of, algorithmic, processes, and, the, development, of, both, hardware, and, software, computing, has, scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological, and, social, aspects, major, computing, disciplines, include, computer, engineering, computer, science, cybersecurity, data, science, information, systems, information, technology, and, software, engineering, the, term, computing, is, also, synonymous, with, counting, and, calculating, in, earlier, times, it, was, used, in, reference, to, the, action, performed, by, mechanical, computing, machines, and, before, that, to, human, computers, the, history, of, computing, is, longer, than, the, history, of, computing, hardware, and, includes, the, history, of, methods, intended, for, pen, and, paper, or, for, chalk, and, slate, with, or, without, the, aid, of, tables, computing, is, intimately, tied, to, the, representation, of, numbers, though, mathematical, concepts, necessary, for, computing, existed, before, numeral, systems, the, earliest, known, tool, for, use, in, computation, is, the, abacus, and, it, is, thought, to, have, been, invented, in, babylon, circa, between, 2700, and, 2300, bc, abaci, of, a, more, modern, design, are, still, used, as, calculation, tools, today, the, first, recorded, proposal, for, using, digital, electronics, in, computing, was, the, 1931, paper, the, use, of, thyratrons, for, high, speed, automatic, counting, of, physical, phenomena, by, c, e, wynn, williams, claude, shannon, s, 1938, paper, a, symbolic, analysis, of, relay, and, switching, circuits, then, introduced, the, idea, of, using, electronics, for, boolean, algebraic, operations, the, concept, of, a, field, effect, transistor, was, proposed, by, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, in, 1925, john, bardeen, and, walter, brattain, while, working, under, william, shockley, at, bell, labs, built, the, first, working, transistor, the, point, contact, transistor, in, 1947, in, 1953, the, university, of, manchester, built, the, first, transistorized, computer, the, manchester, baby, however, early, junction, transistors, were, relatively, bulky, devices, that, were, difficult, to, mass, produce, which, limited, them, to, a, number, of, specialised, applications, in, 1957, frosch, and, derick, were, able, to, manufacture, the, first, silicon, dioxide, field, effect, transistors, at, bell, labs, the, first, transistors, in, which, drain, and, source, were, adjacent, at, the, surface, subsequently, a, team, demonstrated, a, working, mosfet, at, bell, labs, 1960, the, mosfet, made, it, possible, to, build, high, density, integrated, circuits, leading, to, what, is, known, as, the, computer, revolution, or, microcomputer, revolution, a, computer, is, a, machine, that, manipulates, data, according, to, a, set, of, instructions, called, a, computer, program, the, program, has, an, executable, form, that, the, computer, can, use, directly, to, execute, the, instructions, the, same, program, in, its, human, readable, source, code, form, enables, a, programmer, to, study, and, develop, a, sequence, of, steps, known, as, an, algorithm, because, the, instructions, can, be, carried, out, in, different, types, of, computers, a, single, set, of, source, instructions, converts, to, machine, instructions, according, to, the, cpu, type, the, execution, process, carries, out, the, instructions, in, a, computer, program, instructions, express, the, computations, performed, by, the, computer, they, trigger, sequences, of, simple, actions, on, the, executing, machine, those, actions, produce, effects, according, to, the, semantics, of, the, instructions, computer, hardware, includes, the, physical, parts, of, a, computer, including, the, central, processing, unit, memory, and, input, output, computational, logic, and, computer, architecture, are, key, topics, in, the, field, of, computer, hardware, computer, software, or, just, software, is, a, collection, of, computer, programs, and, related, data, which, provides, instructions, to, a, computer, software, refers, to, one, or, more, computer, programs, and, data, held, in, the, storage, of, the, computer, it, is, a, set, of, programs, procedures, algorithms, as, well, as, its, documentation, concerned, with, the, operation, of, a, data, processing, system, program, software, performs, the, function, of, the, program, it, implements, either, by, directly, providing, instructions, to, the, computer, hardware, or, by, serving, as, input, to, another, piece, of, software, the, term, was, coined, to, contrast, with, the, old, term, hardware, meaning, physical, devices, in, contrast, to, hardware, software, is, intangible, software, is, also, sometimes, used, in, a, more, narrow, sense, meaning, application, software, only, system, software, or, systems, software, is, computer, software, designed, to, operate, and, control, computer, hardware, and, to, provide, a, platform, for, running, application, software, system, software, includes, operating, systems, utility, software, device, drivers, window, systems, and, firmware, frequently, used, development, tools, such, as, compilers, linkers, and, debuggers, are, classified, as, system, software, system, software, and, middleware, manage, and, integrate, a, computer, s, capabilities, but, typically, do, not, directly, apply, them, in, the, performance, of, tasks, that, benefit, the, user, unlike, application, software, application, software, also, known, as, an, application, or, an, app, is, computer, software, designed, to, help, the, user, perform, specific, tasks, examples, include, enterprise, software, accounting, software, office, suites, graphics, software, and, media, players, many, application, programs, deal, principally, with, documents, apps, may, be, bundled, with, the, computer, and, its, system, software, or, may, be, published, separately, some, users, are, satisfied, with, the, bundled, apps, and, need, never, install, additional, applications, the, system, software, manages, the, hardware, and, serves, the, application, which, in, turn, serves, the, user, application, software, applies, the, power, of, a, particular, computing, platform, or, system, software, to, a, particular, purpose, some, apps, such, as, microsoft, office, are, developed, in, multiple, versions, for, several, different, platforms, others, have, narrower, requirements, and, are, generally, referred, to, by, the, platform, they, run, on, for, example, a, geography, application, for, windows, or, an, android, application, for, education, or, linux, gaming, applications, that, run, only, on, one, platform, and, increase, the, desirability, of, that, platform, due, to, the, popularity, of, the, application, known, as, killer, applications, a, computer, network, often, simply, referred, to, as, a, network, is, a, collection, of, hardware, components, and, computers, interconnected, by, communication, channels, that, allow, the, sharing, of, resources, and, information, when, at, least, one, process, in, one, device, is, able, to, send, or, receive, data, to, or, from, at, least, one, process, residing, in, a, remote, device, the, two, devices, are, said, to, be, in, a, network, networks, may, be, classified, according, to, a, wide, variety, of, characteristics, such, as, the, medium, used, to, transport, the, data, communications, protocol, used, scale, topology, and, organizational, scope, communications, protocols, define, the, rules, and, data, formats, for, exchanging, information, in, a, computer, network, and, provide, the, basis, for, network, programming, one, well, known, communications, protocol, is, ethernet, a, hardware, and, link, layer, standard, that, is, ubiquitous, in, local, area, networks, another, common, protocol, is, the, internet, protocol, suite, which, defines, a, set, of, protocols, for, internetworking, i, e, for, data, communication, between, multiple, networks, host, to, host, data, transfer, and, application, specific, data, transmission, formats, computer, networking, is, sometimes, considered, a, sub, discipline, of, electrical, engineering, telecommunications, computer, science, information, technology, or, computer, engineering, since, it, relies, upon, the, theoretical, and, practical, application, of, these, disciplines, the, internet, is, a, global, system, of, interconnected, computer, networks, that, use, the, standard, internet, protocol, suite, tcp, ip, to, serve, billions, of, users, this, includes, millions, of, private, public, academic, business, and, government, networks, ranging, in, scope, from, local, to, global, these, networks, are, linked, by, a, broad, array, of, electronic, wireless, and, optical, networking, technologies, the, internet, carries, an, extensive, range, of, information, resources, and, services, such, as, the, inter, linked, hypertext, documents, of, the, world, wide, web, and, the, infrastructure, to, support, email, computer, programming, is, the, process, of, writing, testing, debugging, and, maintaining, the, source, code, and, documentation, of, computer, programs, this, source, code, is, written, in, a, programming, language, which, is, an, artificial, language, that, is, often, more, restrictive, than, natural, languages, but, easily, translated, by, the, computer, programming, is, used, to, invoke, some, desired, behavior, customization, from, the, machine, writing, high, quality, source, code, requires, knowledge, of, both, the, computer, science, domain, and, the, domain, in, which, the, application, will, be, used, the, highest, quality, software, is, thus, often, developed, by, a, team, of, domain, experts, each, a, specialist, in, some, area, of, development, however, the, term, programmer, may, apply, to, a, range, of, program, quality, from, hacker, to, open, source, contributor, to, professional, it, is, also, possible, for, a, single, programmer, to, do, most, or, all, of, the, computer, programming, needed, to, generate, the, proof, of, concept, to, launch, a, new, killer, application, a, programmer, computer, programmer, or, coder, is, a, person, who, writes, computer, software, the, term, computer, programmer, can, refer, to, a, specialist, in, one, area, of, computer, programming, or, to, a, generalist, who, writes, code, for, many, kinds, of, software, one, who, practices, or, professes, a, formal, approach, to, programming, may, also, be, known, as, a, programmer, analyst, a, programmer, s, primary, computer, language, c, c, java, lisp, python, etc, is, often, prefixed, to, the, above, titles, and, those, who, work, in, a, web, environment, often, prefix, their, titles, with, web, the, term, programmer, can, be, used, to, refer, to, a, software, developer, software, engineer, computer, scientist, or, software, analyst, however, members, of, these, professions, typically, possess, other, software, engineering, skills, beyond, programming, the, computer, industry, is, made, up, of, businesses, involved, in, developing, computer, software, designing, computer, hardware, and, computer, networking, infrastructures, manufacturing, computer, components, and, providing, information, technology, services, including, system, administration, and, maintenance, the, software, industry, includes, businesses, engaged, in,

training, in, electronic, engineering, or, electrical, engineering, software, design, and, hardware, software, integration, rather, than, just, software, engineering, or, electronic, engineering, computer, engineers, are, involved, in, many, hardware, and, software, aspects, of, computing, from, the, design, of, individual, microprocessors, personal, computers, and, supercomputers, to, circuit, design, this, field, of, engineering, includes, not, only, the, design, of, hardware, within, its, own, domain, but, also, the, interactions, between, hardware, and, the, context, in, which, it, operates, software, engineering, is, the, application, of, a, systematic, disciplined, and, quantifiable, approach, to, the, design, development, operation, and, maintenance, of, software, and, the, study, of, these, approaches, that, is, the, application, of, engineering, to, software, it, is, the, act, of, using, insights, to, conceive, model, and, scale, a, solution, to, a, problem, the, first, reference, to, the, term, is, the, 1968, nato, software, engineering, conference, and, was, intended, to, provoke, thought, regarding, the, perceived, software, crisis, at, the, time, software, development, a, widely, used, and, more, generic, term, does, not, necessarily, subsume, the, engineering, paradigm, the, generally, accepted, concepts, of, software, engineering, as, an, engineering, discipline, have, been, specified, in, the, guide, to, the, software, engineering, body, of, knowledge, swebok, the, swebok, has, become, an, internationally, accepted, standard, in, iso, iec, tr, 19759, 2015, computer, science, or, computing, science, abbreviated, cs, or, comp, sci, is, the, scientific, and, practical, approach, to, computation, and, its, applications, a, computer, scientist, specializes, in, the, theory, of, computation, and, the, design, of, computational, systems, its, subfields, can, be, divided, into, practical, techniques, for, its, implementation, and, application, in, computer, systems, and, purely, theoretical, areas, some, such, as, computational, complexity, theory, which, studies, fundamental, properties, of, computational, problems, are, highly, abstract, while, others, such, as, computer, graphics, emphasize, real, world, applications, others, focus, on, the, challenges, in, implementing, computations, for, example, programming, language, theory, studies, approaches, to, the, description, of, computations, while, the, study, of, computer, programming, investigates, the, use, of, programming, languages, and, complex, systems, the, field, of, human, computer, interaction, focuses, on, the, challenges, in, making, computers, and, computations, useful, usable, and, universally, accessible, to, humans, the, field, of, cybersecurity, pertains, to, the, protection, of, computer, systems, and, networks, this, includes, information, and, data, privacy, preventing, disruption, of, it, services, and, prevention, of, theft, of, and, damage, to, hardware, software, and, data, data, science, is, a, field, that, uses, scientific, and, computing, tools, to, extract, information, and, insights, from, data, driven, by, the, increasing, volume, and, availability, of, data, data, mining, big, data, statistics, machine, learning, and, deep, learning, are, all, interwoven, with, data, science, information, systems, is, is, the, study, of, complementary, networks, of, hardware, and, software, see, information, technology, that, people, and, organizations, use, to, collect, filter, process, create, and, distribute, data, the, acm, s, computing, careers, describes, is, as, a, majority, of, is, programs, are, located, in, business, schools, however, they, may, have, different, names, such, as, management, information, systems, computer, information, systems, or, business, information, systems, all, is, degrees, combine, business, and, computing, topics, but, the, emphasis, between, technical, and, organizational, issues, varies, among, programs, for, example, programs, differ, substantially, in, the, amount, of, programming, required, the, study, of, is, bridges, business, and, computer, science, using, the, theoretical, foundations, of, information, and, computation, to, study, various, business, models, and, related, algorithmic, processes, within, a, computer, science, discipline, the, field, of, computer, information, systems, cis, studies, computers, and, algorithmic, processes, including, their, principles, their, software, and, hardware, designs, their, applications, and, their, impact, on, society, while, is, emphasizes, functionality, over, design, information, technology, it, is, the, application, of, computers, and, telecommunications, equipment, to, store, retrieve, transmit, and, manipulate, data, often, in, the, context, of, a, business, or, other, enterprise, the, term, is, commonly, used, as, a, synonym, for, computers, and, computer, networks, but, also, encompasses, other, information, distribution, technologies, such, as, television, and, telephones, several, industries, are, associated, with, information, technology, including, computer, hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom, equipment, e, commerce, and, computer, services, dna, based, computing, and, quantum, computing, are, areas, of, active, research, for, both, computing, hardware, and, software, such, as, the, development, of, quantum, algorithms, potential, infrastructure, for, future, technologies, includes, dna, origami, on, photolithography, and, quantum, antennae, for, transferring, information, between, ion, traps, by, 2011, researchers, had, entangled, 14, qubits, fast, digital, circuits, including, those, based, on, josephson, junctions, and, rapid, single, flux, quantum, technology, are, becoming, more, nearly, realizable, with, the, discovery, of, nanoscale, superconductors, fiber, optic, and, photonic, optical, devices, which, already, have, been, used, to, transport, data, over, long, distances, are, starting, to, be, used, by, data, centers, along, with, cpu, and, semiconductor, memory, components, this, allows, the, separation, of, ram, from, cpu, by, optical, interconnects, ibm, has, created, an, integrated, circuit, with, both, electronic, and, optical, information, processing, in, one, chip, this, is, denoted, cmos, integrated, nanophotonics, cinp, one, benefit, of, optical, interconnects, is, that, motherboards, which, formerly, required, a, certain, kind, of, system, on, a, chip, soc, can, now, move, formerly, dedicated, memory, and, network, controllers, off, the, motherboards, spreading, the, controllers, out, onto, the, rack, this, allows, standardization, of, backplane, interconnects, and, motherboards, for, multiple, types, of, socs, which, allows, more, timely, upgrades, of, cpus, another, field, of, research, is, spintronics, spintronics, can, provide, computing, power, and, storage, without, heat, buildup, some, research, is, being, done, on, hybrid, chips, which, combine, photonics, and, spintronics, there, is, also, research, ongoing, on, combining, plasmonics, photonics, and, electronics, cloud, computing, is, a, model, that, allows, for, the, use, of, computing, resources, such, as, servers, or, applications, without, the, need, for, interaction, between, the, owner, of, these, resources, and, the, end, user, it, is, typically, offered, as, a, service, making, it, an, example, of, software, as, a, service, platforms, as, a, service, and, infrastructure, as, a, service, depending, on, the, functionality, offered, key, characteristics, include, on, demand, access, broad, network, access, and, the, capability, of, rapid, scaling, it, allows, individual, users, or, small, business, to, benefit, from, economies, of, scale, one, area, of, interest, in, this, field, is, its, potential, to, support, energy, efficiency, allowing, thousands, of, instances, of, computation, to, occur, on, one, single, machine, instead, of, thousands, of, individual, machines, could, help, save, energy, it, could, also, ease, the, transition, to, renewable, energy, source, since, it, would, suffice, to, power, one, server, farm, with, renewable, energy, rather, than, millions, of, homes, and, offices, however, this, centralized, computing, model, poses, several, challenges, especially, in, security, and, privacy, current, legislation, does, not, sufficiently, protect, users, from, companies, mishandling, their, data, on, company, servers, this, suggests, potential, for, further, legislative, regulations, on, cloud, computing, and, tech, companies, quantum, computing, is, an, area, of, research, that, brings, together, the, disciplines, of, computer, science, information, theory, and, quantum, physics, while, the, idea, of, information, as, part, of, physics, is, relatively, new, there, appears, to, be, a, strong, tie, between, information, theory, and, quantum, mechanics, whereas, traditional, computing, operates, on, a, binary, system, of, ones, and, zeros, quantum, computing, uses, qubits, qubits, are, capable, of, being, in, a, superposition, i, e, in, both, states, of, one, and, zero, simultaneously, thus, the, value, of, the, qubit, is, not, between, 1, and, 0, but, changes, depending, on, when, it, is, measured, this, trait, of, qubits, is, known, as, quantum, entanglement, and, is, the, core, idea, of, quantum, computing, that, allows, quantum, computers, to, do, large, scale, computations, quantum, computing, is, often, used, for, scientific, research, in, cases, where, traditional, computers, do, not, have, the, computing, power, to, do, the, necessary, calculations, such, in, molecular, modeling, large, molecules, and, their, reactions, are, far, too, complex, for, traditional, computers, to, calculate, but, the, computational, power, of, quantum, computers, could, provide, a, tool, to, perform, such, calculations
