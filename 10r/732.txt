a, sailing, ship, is, a, sea, going, vessel, that, uses, sails, mounted, on, masts, to, harness, the, power, of, wind, and, propel, the, vessel, there, is, a, variety, of, sail, plans, that, propel, sailing, ships, employing, square, rigged, or, fore, and, aft, sails, some, ships, carry, square, sails, on, each, mast, the, brig, and, full, rigged, ship, said, to, be, ship, rigged, when, there, are, three, or, more, masts, others, carry, only, fore, and, aft, sails, on, each, mast, for, instance, some, schooners, still, others, employ, a, combination, of, square, and, fore, and, aft, sails, including, the, barque, barquentine, and, brigantine, early, sailing, ships, were, used, for, river, and, coastal, waters, in, ancient, egypt, and, the, mediterranean, the, austronesian, peoples, developed, maritime, technologies, that, included, the, fore, and, aft, crab, claw, sail, and, with, catamaran, and, outrigger, hull, configurations, which, enabled, the, austronesian, expansion, into, the, islands, of, the, indo, pacific, this, expansion, originated, in, taiwan, c, 3000, bc, and, propagated, through, island, southeast, asia, reaching, near, oceania, c, 1500, bc, hawaii, c, 900, ad, and, new, zealand, c, 1200, ad, the, maritime, trading, network, in, the, indo, pacific, dates, from, at, least, 1500, bc, later, developments, in, asia, produced, the, junk, and, dhow, vessels, that, incorporated, features, unknown, in, europe, at, the, time, european, sailing, ships, with, predominantly, square, rigs, became, prevalent, during, the, age, of, discovery, 15th, to, 17th, centuries, when, they, crossed, oceans, between, continents, and, around, the, world, in, the, european, age, of, sail, a, full, rigged, ship, was, one, with, a, bowsprit, and, three, masts, each, of, which, consists, of, a, lower, top, and, topgallant, mast, most, sailing, ships, were, merchantmen, but, the, age, of, sail, also, saw, the, development, of, large, fleets, of, well, armed, warships, the, many, steps, of, technological, development, of, steamships, during, the, 19th, century, provided, slowly, increasing, competition, for, sailing, ships, initially, only, on, short, routes, where, high, prices, could, be, charged, by, the, 1880s, ships, with, triple, expansion, steam, engines, had, the, fuel, efficiency, to, compete, with, sail, on, all, major, routes, and, with, scheduled, sailings, that, were, not, affected, by, the, wind, direction, however, commercial, sailing, vessels, could, still, be, found, working, into, the, 20th, century, although, in, reducing, numbers, and, only, in, certain, trades, by, the, time, of, the, age, of, discovery, starting, in, the, 15th, century, square, rigged, multi, masted, vessels, were, the, norm, and, were, guided, by, navigation, techniques, that, included, the, magnetic, compass, and, making, sightings, of, the, sun, and, stars, that, allowed, transoceanic, voyages, the, age, of, sail, reached, its, peak, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, with, large, heavily, armed, battleships, and, merchant, sailing, ships, sailing, and, steam, ships, coexisted, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, the, steamers, of, the, early, part, of, the, century, had, very, poor, fuel, efficiency, and, were, suitable, only, for, a, small, number, of, roles, such, as, towing, sailing, ships, and, providing, short, route, passenger, and, mail, services, both, sailing, and, steam, ships, saw, large, technological, improvements, over, the, century, ultimately, the, two, large, stepwise, improvements, in, fuel, efficiency, of, compound, and, then, triple, expansion, steam, engines, made, the, steamship, by, the, 1880s, able, to, compete, in, the, vast, majority, of, trades, commercial, sail, still, continued, into, the, 20th, century, with, the, last, ceasing, to, trade, by, c, 1960, 106, 111, 89, early, sea, going, sailing, vessels, were, used, by, the, austronesian, peoples, the, invention, of, catamarans, outriggers, and, crab, claw, sails, enabled, the, austronesian, expansion, at, around, 3000, to, 1500, bc, from, taiwan, they, rapidly, colonized, the, islands, of, maritime, southeast, asia, then, sailed, further, onwards, to, micronesia, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, austronesian, rigs, were, distinctive, in, that, they, had, spars, supporting, both, the, upper, and, lower, edges, of, the, sails, and, sometimes, in, between, in, contrast, to, western, rigs, which, only, had, a, spar, on, the, upper, edge, large, austronesian, trading, ships, with, as, many, as, four, sails, were, recorded, by, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, scholars, as, the, kunlun, bo, or, k, un, lun, po, lit, ship, of, the, kunlun, people, they, were, booked, by, chinese, buddhist, pilgrims, for, passage, to, southern, india, and, sri, lanka, bas, reliefs, of, large, javanese, outriggers, ships, with, various, configurations, of, tanja, sails, are, also, found, in, the, borobudur, temple, dating, back, to, the, 8th, century, ce, 100, by, the, 10th, century, ad, the, song, dynasty, started, building, the, first, chinese, seafaring, junks, which, adopted, several, features, of, the, k, un, lun, po, 18, the, junk, rig, in, particular, became, associated, with, chinese, coast, hugging, trading, ships, 22, 20, 21, junks, in, china, were, constructed, from, teak, with, pegs, and, nails, they, featured, watertight, compartments, and, acquired, center, mounted, tillers, and, rudders, these, ships, became, the, basis, for, the, development, of, chinese, warships, during, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, and, were, used, in, the, unsuccessful, mongol, invasions, of, japan, and, java, 22, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, saw, the, use, of, junks, as, long, distance, trading, vessels, chinese, admiral, zheng, he, reportedly, sailed, to, india, arabia, and, southern, africa, on, a, trade, and, diplomatic, mission, literary, lore, suggests, that, his, largest, vessel, the, treasure, ship, measured, 400, feet, 120, m, in, length, and, 150, feet, 46, m, in, width, whereas, modern, research, suggests, that, it, was, unlikely, to, have, exceeded, 70, metres, 230, ft, in, length, sailing, ships, in, the, mediterranean, region, date, back, to, at, least, 3000, bc, when, egyptians, used, a, bipod, mast, to, support, a, single, square, sail, on, a, vessel, that, mainly, relied, on, multiple, paddlers, later, the, mast, became, a, single, pole, and, paddles, were, supplanted, with, oars, such, vessels, plied, both, the, nile, and, the, mediterranean, coast, the, minoan, civilization, of, crete, may, have, been, the, world, s, first, thalassocracy, brought, to, prominence, by, sailing, vessels, dating, to, before, 1800, bc, middle, minoan, iib, between, 1000, bc, and, 400, ad, the, phoenicians, greeks, and, romans, developed, ships, that, were, powered, by, square, sails, sometimes, with, oars, to, supplement, their, capabilities, such, vessels, used, a, steering, oar, as, a, rudder, to, control, direction, starting, in, the, 8th, century, in, denmark, vikings, were, building, clinker, constructed, longships, propelled, by, a, single, square, sail, when, practical, and, oars, when, necessary, a, related, craft, was, the, knarr, which, plied, the, baltic, and, north, seas, using, primarily, sail, power, the, windward, edge, of, the, sail, was, stiffened, with, a, beitass, a, pole, that, fitted, into, the, lower, corner, of, the, sail, when, sailing, close, to, the, wind, india, s, maritime, history, began, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, when, inhabitants, of, the, indus, valley, initiated, maritime, trading, contact, with, mesopotamia, indian, kingdoms, such, as, the, kalinga, from, as, early, as, 2nd, century, ce, are, believed, to, have, had, sailing, ships, one, of, the, earliest, instances, of, documented, evidence, of, indian, sailing, ship, building, comes, from, the, mural, of, three, masted, ship, in, the, ajanta, caves, that, date, back, to, 400, 500, ce, the, indian, ocean, was, the, venue, for, increasing, trade, between, india, and, africa, between, 1200, and, 1500, the, vessels, employed, would, be, classified, as, dhows, with, lateen, rigs, during, this, interval, such, vessels, grew, in, capacity, from, 100, to, 400, tonnes, dhows, were, often, built, with, teak, planks, from, india, and, southeast, asia, sewn, together, with, coconut, husk, fiber, no, nails, were, employed, this, period, also, saw, the, implementation, of, center, mounted, rudders, controlled, with, a, tiller, technological, advancements, that, were, important, to, the, age, of, discovery, in, the, 15th, century, were, the, adoption, of, the, magnetic, compass, and, advances, in, ship, design, the, compass, was, an, addition, to, the, ancient, method, of, navigation, based, on, sightings, of, the, sun, and, stars, the, compass, was, invented, by, chinese, it, had, been, used, for, navigation, in, china, by, the, 11th, century, and, was, adopted, by, the, arab, traders, in, the, indian, ocean, the, compass, spread, to, europe, by, the, late, 12th, or, early, 13th, century, use, of, the, compass, for, navigation, in, the, indian, ocean, was, first, mentioned, in, 1232, the, europeans, used, a, dry, compass, with, a, needle, on, a, pivot, the, compass, card, was, also, a, european, invention, at, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, century, the, carrack, was, the, most, capable, european, ocean, going, ship, it, was, carvel, built, and, large, enough, to, be, stable, in, heavy, seas, it, was, capable, of, carrying, a, large, cargo, and, the, provisions, needed, for, very, long, voyages, later, carracks, were, square, rigged, on, the, foremast, and, mainmast, and, lateen, rigged, on, the, mizzenmast, they, had, a, high, rounded, stern, with, large, aftcastle, forecastle, and, bowsprit, at, the, stem, as, the, predecessor, of, the, galleon, the, carrack, was, one, of, the, most, influential, ship, designs, in, history, while, ships, became, more, specialized, in, the, following, centuries, the, basic, design, remained, unchanged, throughout, this, period, ships, of, this, era, were, only, able, to, sail, approximately, 70, into, the, wind, and, tacked, from, one, side, to, the, other, across, the, wind, with, difficulty, which, made, it, challenging, to, avoid, shipwrecks, when, near, shores, or, shoals, during, storms, nonetheless, such, vessels, reached, india, around, africa, with, vasco, da, gama, the, americas, with, christopher, columbus, and, around, the, world, under, ferdinand, magellan, sailing, ships, became, longer, and, faster, over, time, with, ship, rigged, vessels, carrying, taller, masts, with, more, square, sails, other, sail, plans, emerged, as, well, that, had, just, fore, and, aft, sails, schooners, or, a, mixture, of, the, two, brigantines, barques, and, barquentines, cannons, were, introduced, in, the, 14th, century, but, did, not, become, common, at, sea, until, they, could, be, reloaded, quickly, enough, to, be, reused, in, the, same, battle, the, size, of, a, ship, required, to, carry, a, large, number, of, cannon, made, oar, based, propulsion, impossible, and, warships, came, to, rely, primarily, on, sails, the, sailing, man, of, war, emerged, during, the, 16th, century, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, warships, were, carrying, increasing, numbers, of, cannon, on, three, decks, naval, tactics, evolved, to, bring, each, ship, s, firepower, to, bear, in, a, line, of, battle, coordinated, movements, of, a, fleet, of, warships, to, engage, a, line, of, ships, in, the, enemy, fleet, carracks, with, a, single, cannon, deck, evolved, into, galleons, with, as, many, as, two, full, cannon, decks, which, evolved, into, the, man, of, war, and, further, into, the, ship, of, the, line, designed, for, engaging, the, enemy, in, a, line, of, battle, one, side, of, a, ship, was, expected, to, shoot, broadsides, against, an, enemy, ship, at, close, range, in, the, 18th, century, the, small, and, fast, frigate, and, sloop, of, war, too, small, to, stand, in, the, line, of, battle, evolved, to, convoy, trade, scout, for, enemy, ships, and, blockade, enemy, coasts, the, term, clipper, started, to, be, used, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, applied, to, sailing, vessels, designed, primarily, for, speed, only, a, small, proportion, of, sailing, vessels, could, properly, have, the, term, applied, to, them, 33, early, examples, were, the, schooners, and, brigantines, called, baltimore, clippers, used, for, blockade, running, or, as, privateers, in, the, war, of, 1812, and, afterwards, for, smuggling, opium, or, illegally, transporting, slaves, larger, clippers, usually, ship, or, barque, rigged, and, with, a, different, hull, design, were, built, for, the, california, trade, from, east, coast, usa, ports, to, san, francisco, after, gold, was, discovered, in, 1848, the, associated, ship, building, boom, lasted, until, 1854, 7, 9, 13, 14, clippers, were, built, for, trade, between, the, united, kingdom, and, china, after, the, east, india, company, lost, its, monopoly, in, 1834, the, primary, cargo, was, tea, and, sailing, ships, particularly, tea, clippers, dominated, this, long, distance, route, until, the, development, of, fuel, efficient, steamships, coincided, with, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, 9, 10, 209, other, clippers, worked, on, the, australian, immigrant, routes, or, in, smaller, quantities, in, any, role, where, a, fast, passage, secured, higher, rates, of, freight, or, passenger, fares, whilst, many, clippers, were, ship, rigged, the, definition, is, not, limited, to, any, rig, 10, 11, clippers, were, generally, built, for, a, specific, trade, those, in, the, california, trade, had, to, withstand, the, seas, of, cape, horn, whilst, tea, clippers, were, designed, for, the, lighter, and, contrary, winds, of, the, china, sea, all, had, fine, lines, with, a, well, streamlined, hull, and, carried, a, large, sail, area, to, get, the, best, of, this, a, skilled, and, determined, master, was, needed, in, command, 16, 19, during, the, age, of, sail, ships, hulls, were, under, frequent, attack, by, shipworm, which, affected, the, structural, strength, of, timbers, and, barnacles, and, various, marine, weeds, which, affected, ship, speed, since, before, the, common, era, a, variety, of, coatings, had, been, applied, to, hulls, to, counter, this, effect, including, pitch, wax, tar, oil, sulfur, and, arsenic, in, the, mid, 18th, century, copper, sheathing, was, developed, as, a, defense, against, such, bottom, fouling, after, coping, with, problems, of, galvanic, deterioration, of, metal, hull, fasteners, sacrificial, anodes, were, developed, which, were, designed, to, corrode, instead, of, the, hull, fasteners, the, practice, became, widespread, on, naval, vessels, starting, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, on, merchant, vessels, starting, in, the, early, 19th, century, until, the, advent, of, iron, and, steel, hulls, iron, hulled, sailing, ships, often, referred, to, as, windjammers, or, tall, ships, represented, the, final, evolution, of, sailing, ships, at, the, end, of, the, age, of, sail, they, were, built, to, carry, bulk, cargo, for, long, distances, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, they, were, the, largest, of, merchant, sailing, ships, with, three, to, five, masts, and, square, sails, as, well, as, other, sail, plans, they, carried, lumber, guano, grain, or, ore, between, continents, later, examples, had, steel, hulls, iron, hulled, sailing, ships, were, mainly, built, from, the, 1870s, to, 1900, when, steamships, began, to, outpace, them, economically, due, to, their, ability, to, keep, a, schedule, regardless, of, the, wind, steel, hulls, also, replaced, iron, hulls, at, around, the, same, time, even, into, the, twentieth, century, sailing, ships, could, hold, their, own, on, transoceanic, voyages, such, as, australia, to, europe, since, they, did, not, require, bunkerage, for, coal, nor, fresh, water, for, steam, and, they, were, faster, than, the, early, steamers, which, usually, could, barely, make, 8, knots, 15, km, h, the, four, masted, iron, hulled, ship, introduced, in, 1875, with, the, full, rigged, county, of, peebles, represented, an, especially, efficient, configuration, that, prolonged, the, competitiveness, of, sail, against, steam, in, the, later, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, largest, example, of, such, ships, was, the, five, masted, full, rigged, ship, preussen, which, had, a, load, capacity, of, 7, 800, tonnes, ships, transitioned, from, all, sail, to, all, steam, power, from, the, mid, 19th, century, into, the, 20th, five, masted, preussen, used, steam, power, for, driving, the, winches, hoists, and, pumps, and, could, be, manned, by, a, crew, of, 48, compared, with, four, masted, kruzenshtern, which, has, a, crew, of, 257, coastal, top, sail, schooners, with, a, crew, as, small, as, two, managing, the, sail, handling, became, an, efficient, way, to, carry, bulk, cargo, since, only, the, fore, sails, required, tending, while, tacking, and, steam, driven, machinery, was, often, available, for, raising, the, sails, and, the, anchor, in, the, 20th, century, the, dynarig, allowed, central, automated, control, of, all, sails, in, a, manner, that, obviates, the, need, for, sending, crew, aloft, this, was, developed, in, the, 1960s, in, germany, as, a, low, carbon, footprint, propulsion, alternative, for, commercial, ships, the, rig, automatically, sets, and, reefs, sails, its, mast, rotates, to, align, the, sails, with, the, wind, the, sailing, yachts, maltese, falcon, and, black, pearl, employ, the, rig, in, the, 21st, century, due, to, concern, about, climate, change, and, the, possibility, of, cost, savings, companies, explored, using, wind, power, to, reduce, heavy, fuel, needs, on, large, containerized, cargo, ships, by, 2023, around, 30, ships, were, using, sails, or, attached, kites, with, the, number, expected, to, grow, the, following, year, the, economist, wrote, that, the, technology, was, at, an, inflection, point, as, it, moved, from, trials, and, testing, towards, adoption, by, the, industry, every, sailing, ship, has, a, sail, plan, that, is, adapted, to, the, purpose, of, the, vessel, and, the, ability, of, the, crew, each, has, a, hull, rigging, and, masts, to, hold, up, the, sails, that, use, the, wind, to, power, the, ship, the, masts, are, supported, by, standing, rigging, and, the, sails, are, adjusted, by, running, rigging, hull, shapes, for, sailing, ships, evolved, from, being, relatively, short, and, blunt, to, being, longer, and, finer, at, the, bow, by, the, nineteenth, century, ships, were, built, with, reference, to, a, half, model, made, from, wooden, layers, that, were, pinned, together, each, layer, could, be, scaled, to, the, actual, size, of, the, vessel, in, order, to, lay, out, its, hull, structure, starting, with, the, keel, and, leading, to, the, ship, s, ribs, the, ribs, were, pieced, together, from, curved, elements, called, futtocks, and, tied, in, place, until, the, installation, of, the, planking, typically, planking, was, caulked, with, a, tar, impregnated, yarn, made, from, manila, or, hemp, to, make, the, planking, watertight, starting, in, the, mid, 19th, century, iron, was, used, first, for, the, hull, structure, and, later, for, its, watertight, sheathing, until, the, mid, 19th, century, all, vessels, masts, were, made, of, wood, formed, from, a, single, or, several, pieces, of, timber, which, typically, consisted, of, the, trunk, of, a, conifer, tree, from, the, 16th, century, vessels, were, often, built, of, a, size, requiring, masts, taller, and, thicker, than, could, be, made, from, single, tree, trunks, on, these, larger, vessels, to, achieve, the, required, height, the, masts, were, built, from, up, to, four, sections, also, called, masts, known, in, order, of, rising, height, above, the, decks, as, the, lower, top, topgallant, and, royal, masts, giving, the, lower, sections, sufficient, thickness, necessitated, building, them, up, from, separate, pieces, of, wood, such, a, section, was, known, as, a, made, mast, as, opposed, to, sections, formed, from, single, pieces, of, timber, which, were, known, as, pole, masts, starting, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, masts, were, made, of, iron, or, steel, for, ships, with, square, sails, the, principal, masts, given, their, standard, names, in, bow, to, stern, front, to, back, order, are, each, rig, is, configured, in, a, sail, plan, appropriate, to, the, size, of, the, sailing, craft, both, square, rigged, and, fore, and, aft, rigged, vessels, have, been, built, with, a, wide, range, of, configurations, for, single, and, multiple, masts, types, of, sail, that, can, be, part, of, a, sail, plan, can, be, broadly, classed, by, how, they, are, attached, to, the, sailing, craft, sailing, ships, have, standing, rigging, to, support, the, masts, and, running, rigging, to, raise, the, sails, and, control, their, ability, to, draw, power, from, the, wind, the, running, rigging, has, three, main, roles, to, support, the, sail, structure, to, shape, the, sail, and, to, adjust, its, angle, to, the, wind, square, rigged, vessels, require, more, controlling, lines, than, fore, and, aft, rigged, ones, sailing, ships, prior, to, the, mid, 19th, century, used, wood, masts, with, hemp, fiber, standing, rigging, as, rigs, became, taller, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, masts, relied, more, heavily, on, successive, spars, stepped, one, atop, the, other, to, form, the, whole, from, bottom, to, top, the, lower, mast, top, mast, and, topgallant, mast, this, construction, relied, heavily, on, support, by, a, complex, array, of, stays, and, shrouds, each, stay, in, either, the, fore, and, aft, or, athwartships, direction, had, a, corresponding, one, in, the, opposite, direction, providing, counter, tension, fore, and, aft, the, system, of, tensioning, started, with, the, stays, that, were, anchored, in, front, each, mast, shrouds, were, tensioned, by, pairs, of, deadeyes, circular, blocks, that, had, the, large, diameter, line, run, around, them, whilst, multiple, holes, allowed, smaller, line, lanyard, to, pass, multiple, times, between, the, two, and, thereby, allow, tensioning, of, the, shroud, after, the, mid, 19th, century, square, rigged, vessels, were, equipped, with, iron, wire, standing, rigging, which, was, superseded, with, steel, wire, in, the, late, 19th, century, 46, halyards, used, to, raise, and, lower, the, yards, are, the, primary, supporting, lines, in, addition, square, rigs, have, lines, that, lift, the, sail, or, the, yard, from, which, it, is, suspended, that, include, brails, buntlines, lifts, and, leechlines, bowlines, and, clew, lines, shape, a, square, sail, to, adjust, the, angle, of, the, sail, to, wind, braces, are, used, to, adjust, the, fore, and, aft, angle, of, a, yard, of, a, square, sail, while, sheets, attach, to, the, clews, bottom, corners, of, a, sail, to, control, the, sail, s, angle, to, the, wind, sheets, run, aft, whereas, tacks, are, used, to, haul, the, clew, of, a, square, sail, forward, the, crew, of, a, sailing, ship, is, divided, between, officers, the, captain, and, his, subordinates, and, seamen, or, ordinary, hands, an, able, seaman, was, expected, to, hand, reef, and, steer, handle, the, lines, and, other, equipment, reef, the, sails, and, steer, the, vessel, the, crew, is, organized, to, stand, watch, the, oversight, of, the, ship, for, a, period, typically, four, hours, each, richard, henry, dana, jr, and, herman, melville, each, had, personal, experience, aboard, sailing, vessels, of, the, 19th, century, dana, described, the, crew, of, the, merchant, brig, pilgrim, as, comprising, six, to, eight, common, sailors, four, specialist, crew, members, the, steward, cook, carpenter, and, sailmaker, and, three, officers, the, captain, the, first, mate, and, the, second, mate, he, contrasted, the, american, crew, complement, with, that, of, other, nations, on, whose, similarly, sized, ships, the, crew, might, number, as, many, as, 30, larger, merchant, vessels, had, larger, crews, melville, described, the, crew, complement, of, the, frigate, warship, united, states, as, about, 500, including, officers, enlisted, personnel, and, 50, marines, the, crew, was, divided, into, the, starboard, and, larboard, watches, it, was, also, divided, into, three, tops, bands, of,

of, the, ship, he, additionally, named, such, positions, as, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, coopers, painters, tinkers, stewards, cooks, and, various, boys, as, functions, on, the, man, of, war, 18, 19th, century, ships, of, the, line, had, a, complement, as, high, as, 850, handling, a, sailing, ship, requires, management, of, its, sails, to, power, but, not, overpower, the, ship, and, navigation, to, guide, the, ship, both, at, sea, and, in, and, out, of, harbors, key, elements, of, sailing, a, ship, are, setting, the, right, amount, of, sail, to, generate, maximum, power, without, endangering, the, ship, adjusting, the, sails, to, the, wind, direction, on, the, course, sailed, and, changing, tack, to, bring, the, wind, from, one, side, of, the, vessel, to, the, other, a, sailing, ship, crew, manages, the, running, rigging, of, each, square, sail, each, sail, has, two, sheets, that, control, its, lower, corners, two, braces, that, control, the, angle, of, the, yard, two, clewlines, four, buntlines, and, two, reef, tackles, all, these, lines, must, be, manned, as, the, sail, is, deployed, and, the, yard, raised, they, use, a, halyard, to, raise, each, yard, and, its, sail, then, they, pull, or, ease, the, braces, to, set, the, angle, of, the, yard, across, the, vessel, they, pull, on, sheets, to, haul, lower, corners, of, the, sail, clews, out, to, yard,

strong, winds, the, crew, is, directed, to, reduce, the, number, of, sails, or, alternatively, the, amount, of, each, given, sail, that, is, presented, to, the, wind, by, a, process, called, reefing, to, pull, the, sail, up, seamen, on, the, yardarm, pull, on, reef, tackles, attached, to, reef, cringles, to, pull, the, sail, up, and, secure, it, with, lines, called, reef, points, dana, spoke, of, the, hardships, of, sail, handling, during, high, wind, and, rain, or, with, ice, covering, the, ship, and, its, rigging, sailing, vessels, cannot, sail, directly, into, the, wind, instead, square, riggers, must, sail, a, course, that, is, between, 60, and, 70, away, from, the, wind, direction, and, fore, and, aft, vessels, can, typically, sail, no, closer, than, 45, to, reach, a, destination, sailing, vessels, may, have, to, change, course, and, allow, the, wind, to, come, from, the, opposite, side, in, a, procedure, called, tacking, when, the, wind, comes, across, the, bow, during, the, maneuver, when, tacking, a, square, rigged, vessel, s, sails, must, be, presented, squarely, to, the, wind, and, thus, impede, forward, motion, as, they, are, swung, around, via, the, yardarms, through, the, wind, as, controlled, by, the, vessel, s, running, rigging, using, braces, adjusting, the, fore, and, aft, angle, of, each, yardarm, around, the, mast, and, sheets, attached, to, the, clews, bottom, corners, of, each, sail, to, control, the, sail, s, angle, to, the, wind, the, procedure, is, to, turn, the, vessel, into, the, wind, with, the, hind, most, fore, and, aft, sail, the, spanker, pulled, to, windward, to, help, turn, the, ship, through, the, eye, of, the, wind, once, the, ship, has, come, about, all, the, sails, are, adjusted, to, align, properly, with, the, new, tack, because, square, rigger, masts, are, more, strongly, braced, from, behind, than, from, ahead, tacking, is, a, dangerous, procedure, in, strong, winds, the, ship, may, lose, forward, momentum, become, caught, in, stays, and, the, rigging, may, fail, from, the, wind, coming, from, ahead, the, ship, may, also, lose, momentum, at, wind, speeds, of, less, than, 10, knots, 19, km, h, under, these, conditions, the, choice, may, be, to, wear, ship, to, turn, the, ship, away, from, the, wind, and, around, 240, onto, the, next, tack, 60, off, the, wind, a, fore, and, aft, rig, permits, the, wind, to, flow, past, the, sail, as, the, craft, head, through, the, eye, of, the, wind, most, rigs, pivot, around, a, stay, or, the, mast, while, this, occurs, for, a, jib, the, old, leeward, sheet, is, released, as, the, craft, heads, through, the, wind, and, the, old, windward, sheet, is, tightened, as, the, new, leeward, sheet, to, allow, the, sail, to, draw, wind, mainsails, are, often, self, tending, and, slide, on, a, traveler, to, the, opposite, side, on, certain, rigs, such, as, lateens, and, luggers, the, sail, may, be, partially, lowered, to, bring, it, to, the, opposite, side, early, navigational, techniques, employed, observations, of, the, sun, stars, waves, and, birdlife, in, the, 15th, century, the, chinese, were, using, the, magnetic, compass, to, identify, direction, of, travel, by, the, 16th, century, in, europe, navigational, instruments, included, the, quadrant, the, astrolabe, cross, staff, dividers, and, compass, by, the, time, of, the, age, of, exploration, these, tools, were, being, used, in, combination, with, a, log, to, measure, speed, a, lead, line, to, measure, soundings, and, a, lookout, to, identify, potential, hazards, later, an, accurate, marine, sextant, became, standard, for, determining, latitude, and, was, used, with, an, accurate, chronometer, to, calculate, longitude, passage, planning, begins, with, laying, out, a, route, along, a, chart, which, comprises, a, series, of, courses, between, fixes, verifiable, locations, that, confirm, the, actual, track, of, the, ship, on, the, ocean, once, a, course, has, been, set, the, person, at, the, helm, attempts, to, follow, its, direction, with, reference, to, the, compass, the, navigator, notes, the, time, and, speed, at, each, fix, to, estimate, the, arrival, at, the, next, fix, a, process, called, dead, reckoning, for, coast, wise, navigation, sightings, from, known, landmarks, or, navigational, aids, may, be, used, to, establish, fixes, a, process, called, pilotage, at, sea, sailing, ships, used, celestial, navigation, on, a, daily, schedule, as, follows, fixes, were, taken, with, a, marine, sextant, which, measures, the, distance, of, the, celestial, body, above, the, horizon, given, the, limited, maneuverability, of, sailing, ships, it, could, be, difficult, to, enter, and, leave, harbor, with, the, presence, of, a, tide, without, coordinating, arrivals, with, a, flooding, tide, and, departures, with, an, ebbing, tide, in, harbor, a, sailing, ship, stood, at, anchor, unless, it, needed, to, be, loaded, or, unloaded, at, a, dock, or, pier, in, which, case, it, might, be, warped, alongside, or, towed, by, a, tug, warping, involved, using, a, long, rope, the, warp, between, the, ship, and, a, fixed, point, on, the, shore, this, was, pulled, on, by, a, capstan, on, shore, or, on, the, ship, this, might, be, a, multi, stage, process, if, the, route, was, not, simple, if, no, fixed, point, was, available, a, kedge, anchor, might, be, taken, out, in, a, ship, s, boat, to, a, suitable, point, and, the, ship, then, pulled, up, to, the, kedge, square, rigged, vessels, could, use, backing, and, filling, of, the, sails, to, manoeuvre, in, a, tideway, or, control, could, be, maintained, by, drudging, the, anchor, lower, the, anchor, until, it, touches, the, bottom, so, that, the, dragging, anchor, gives, steerage, way, in, the, flow, of, the, tide, 199, 202, these, are, examples, of, sailing, ships, some, terms, have, multiple, meanings, defined, by, general, configuration, defined, by, sail, plan, all, masts, have,
