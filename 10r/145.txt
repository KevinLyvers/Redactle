in, electronics, and, electrical, engineering, a, fuse, is, an, electrical, safety, device, that, operates, to, provide, overcurrent, protection, of, an, electrical, circuit, its, essential, component, is, a, metal, wire, or, strip, that, melts, when, too, much, current, flows, through, it, thereby, stopping, or, interrupting, the, current, it, is, a, sacrificial, device, once, a, fuse, has, operated, it, is, an, open, circuit, and, must, be, replaced, or, rewired, depending, on, its, type, fuses, have, been, used, as, essential, safety, devices, from, the, early, days, of, electrical, engineering, today, there, are, thousands, of, different, fuse, designs, which, have, specific, current, and, voltage, ratings, breaking, capacity, and, response, times, depending, on, the, application, the, time, and, current, operating, characteristics, of, fuses, are, chosen, to, provide, adequate, protection, without, needless, interruption, wiring, regulations, usually, define, a, maximum, fuse, current, rating, for, particular, circuits, short, circuits, overloading, mismatched, loads, or, device, failure, are, the, prime, or, some, of, the, reasons, for, fuse, operation, when, a, damaged, live, wire, makes, contact, with, a, metal, case, that, is, connected, to, ground, a, short, circuit, will, form, and, the, fuse, will, melt, a, fuse, is, an, automatic, means, of, removing, power, from, a, faulty, system, often, abbreviated, to, ads, automatic, disconnection, of, supply, circuit, breakers, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, fuses, but, have, significantly, different, characteristics, breguet, recommended, the, use, of, reduced, section, conductors, to, protect, telegraph, stations, from, lightning, strikes, by, melting, the, smaller, wires, would, protect, apparatus, and, wiring, inside, the, building, a, variety, of, wire, or, foil, fusible, elements, were, in, use, to, protect, telegraph, cables, and, lighting, installations, as, early, as, 1864, a, fuse, was, patented, by, thomas, edison, in, 1890, as, part, of, his, electric, distribution, system, a, fuse, consists, of, a, metal, strip, or, wire, fuse, element, of, small, cross, section, compared, to, the, circuit, conductors, mounted, between, a, pair, of, electrical, terminals, and, usually, enclosed, by, a, non, combustible, housing, the, fuse, is, arranged, in, series, to, carry, all, the, charge, passing, through, the, protected, circuit, the, resistance, of, the, element, generates, heat, due, to, the, current, flow, the, size, and, construction, of, the, element, is, empirically, determined, so, that, the, heat, produced, for, a, normal, current, does, not, cause, the, element, to, attain, a, high, temperature, if, too, high, a, current, flows, the, element, rises, to, a, higher, temperature, and, either, directly, melts, or, else, melts, a, soldered, joint, within, the, fuse, opening, the, circuit, the, fuse, element, is, made, of, zinc, copper, silver, aluminum, or, alloys, among, these, or, other, various, metals, to, provide, stable, and, predictable, characteristics, the, fuse, ideally, would, carry, its, rated, current, indefinitely, and, melt, quickly, on, a, small, excess, the, element, must, not, be, damaged, by, minor, harmless, surges, of, current, and, must, not, oxidize, or, change, its, behavior, after, possibly, years, of, service, the, fuse, elements, may, be, shaped, to, increase, heating, effect, in, large, fuses, current, may, be, divided, between, multiple, strips, of, metal, a, dual, element, fuse, may, contain, a, metal, strip, that, melts, instantly, on, a, short, circuit, and, also, contain, a, low, melting, solder, joint, that, responds, to, long, term, overload, of, low, values, compared, to, a, short, circuit, fuse, elements, may, be, supported, by, steel, or, nichrome, wires, so, that, no, strain, is, placed, on, the, element, but, a, spring, may, be, included, to, increase, the, speed, of, parting, of, the, element, fragments, the, fuse, element, may, be, surrounded, by, air, or, by, materials, intended, to, speed, the, quenching, of, the, arc, silica, sand, or, non, conducting, liquids, may, be, used, a, maximum, current, that, the, fuse, can, continuously, conduct, without, interrupting, the, circuit, the, speed, at, which, a, fuse, blows, depends, on, how, much, current, flows, through, it, and, the, material, of, which, the, fuse, is, made, manufacturers, can, provide, a, plot, of, current, vs, time, often, plotted, on, logarithmic, scales, to, characterize, the, device, and, to, allow, comparison, with, the, characteristics, of, protective, devices, upstream, and, downstream, of, the, fuse, the, operating, time, is, not, a, fixed, interval, but, decreases, as, the, current, increases, fuses, are, designed, to, have, particular, characteristics, of, operating, time, compared, to, current, a, standard, fuse, may, require, twice, its, rated, current, to, open, in, one, second, a, fast, blow, fuse, may, require, twice, its, rated, current, to, blow, in, 0, 1, seconds, and, a, slow, blow, fuse, may, require, twice, its, rated, current, for, tens, of, seconds, to, blow, fuse, selection, depends, on, the, load, s, characteristics, semiconductor, devices, may, use, a, fast, or, ultrafast, fuse, as, semiconductor, devices, heat, rapidly, when, excess, current, flows, the, fastest, blowing, fuses, are, designed, for, the, most, sensitive, electrical, equipment, where, even, a, short, exposure, to, an, overload, current, could, be, damaging, normal, fast, blow, fuses, are, the, most, general, purpose, fuses, a, time, delay, fuse, also, known, as, an, anti, surge, or, slow, blow, fuse, is, designed, to, allow, a, current, which, is, above, the, rated, value, of, the, fuse, to, flow, for, a, short, period, of, time, without, the, fuse, blowing, these, types, of, fuse, are, used, on, equipment, such, as, motors, which, can, draw, larger, than, normal, currents, for, up, to, several, seconds, while, coming, up, to, speed, the, i, 2, t, rating, is, related, to, the, amount, of, energy, let, through, by, the, fuse, element, when, it, clears, the, electrical, fault, this, term, is, normally, used, in, short, circuit, conditions, and, the, values, are, used, to, perform, co, ordination, studies, in, electrical, networks, i, 2, t, parameters, are, provided, by, charts, in, manufacturer, data, sheets, for, each, fuse, family, for, coordination, of, fuse, operation, with, upstream, or, downstream, devices, both, melting, i, 2, t, and, clearing, i, 2, t, are, specified, the, melting, i, 2, t, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, energy, required, to, begin, melting, the, fuse, element, the, clearing, i, 2, t, is, proportional, to, the, total, energy, let, through, by, the, fuse, when, clearing, a, fault, the, energy, is, mainly, dependent, on, current, and, time, for, fuses, as, well, as, the, available, fault, level, and, system, voltage, since, the, i, 2, t, rating, of, the, fuse, is, proportional, to, the, energy, it, lets, through, it, is, a, measure, of, the, thermal, damage, from, the, heat, and, magnetic, forces, that, will, be, produced, by, a, fault, end, the, breaking, capacity, is, the, maximum, current, that, can, safely, be, interrupted, by, the, fuse, this, should, be, higher, than, the, prospective, short, circuit, current, miniature, fuses, may, have, an, interrupting, rating, only, 10, times, their, rated, current, fuses, for, small, low, voltage, usually, residential, wiring, systems, are, commonly, rated, in, north, american, practice, to, interrupt, 10, 000, amperes, fuses, for, commercial, or, industrial, power, systems, must, have, higher, interrupting, ratings, with, some, low, voltage, current, limiting, high, interrupting, fuses, rated, for, 300, 000, amperes, fuses, for, high, voltage, equipment, up, to, 115, 000, volts, are, rated, by, the, total, apparent, power, megavolt, amperes, mva, of, the, fault, level, on, the, circuit, some, fuses, are, designated, high, rupture, capacity, hrc, or, high, breaking, capacity, hbc, and, are, usually, filled, with, sand, or, a, similar, material, low, voltage, high, rupture, capacity, hrc, fuses, are, used, in, the, area, of, main, distribution, boards, in, low, voltage, networks, where, there, is, a, high, prospective, short, circuit, current, they, are, generally, larger, than, screw, type, fuses, and, have, ferrule, cap, or, blade, contacts, high, rupture, capacity, fuses, may, be, rated, to, interrupt, current, of, 120, ka, hrc, fuses, are, widely, used, in, industrial, installations, and, are, also, used, in, the, public, power, grid, e, g, in, transformer, stations, main, distribution, boards, or, in, building, junction, boxes, and, as, meter, fuses, in, some, countries, because, of, the, high, fault, current, available, where, these, fuses, are, used, local, regulations, may, permit, only, trained, personnel, to, change, these, fuses, some, varieties, of, hrc, fuse, include, special, handling, features, the, voltage, rating, of, the, fuse, must, be, equal, to, or, greater, than, what, would, become, the, open, circuit, voltage, for, example, a, glass, tube, fuse, rated, at, 32, volts, would, not, reliably, interrupt, current, from, a, voltage, source, of, 120, or, 230, v, if, a, 32, v, fuse, attempts, to, interrupt, the, 120, or, 230, v, source, an, arc, may, result, plasma, inside, the, glass, tube, may, continue, to, conduct, current, until, the, current, diminishes, to, the, point, where, the, plasma, becomes, a, non, conducting, gas, rated, voltage, should, be, higher, than, the, maximum, voltage, source, it, would, have, to, disconnect, connecting, fuses, in, series, does, not, increase, the, rated, voltage, of, the, combination, nor, of, any, one, fuse, medium, voltage, fuses, rated, for, a, few, thousand, volts, are, never, used, on, low, voltage, circuits, because, of, their, cost, and, because, they, cannot, properly, clear, the, circuit, when, operating, at, very, low, voltages, the, manufacturer, may, specify, the, voltage, drop, across, the, fuse, at, rated, current, there, is, a, direct, relationship, between, a, fuse, s, cold, resistance, and, its, voltage, drop, value, once, current, is, applied, resistance, and, voltage, drop, of, a, fuse, will, constantly, grow, with, the, rise, of, its, operating, temperature, until, the, fuse, finally, reaches, thermal, equilibrium, the, voltage, drop, should, be, taken, into, account, particularly, when, using, a, fuse, in, low, voltage, applications, voltage, drop, often, is, not, significant, in, more, traditional, wire, type, fuses, but, can, be, significant, in, other, technologies, such, as, resettable, pptc, type, fuses, ambient, temperature, will, change, a, fuse, s, operational, parameters, a, fuse, rated, for, 1, a, at, 25, c, may, conduct, up, to, 10, or, 20, more, current, at, 40, c, and, may, open, at, 80, of, its, rated, value, at, 100, c, operating, values, will, vary, with, each, fuse, family, and, are, provided, in, manufacturer, data, sheets, most, fuses, are, marked, on, the, body, or, end, caps, with, markings, that, indicate, their, ratings, surface, mount, technology, chip, type, fuses, feature, few, or, no, markings, making, identification, very, difficult, similar, appearing, fuses, may, have, significantly, different, properties, identified, by, their, markings, fuse, markings, will, generally, convey, the, following, information, either, explicitly, as, text, or, else, implicit, with, the, approval, agency, marking, for, a, particular, type, fuses, come, in, a, vast, array, of, sizes, and, styles, to, serve, in, many, applications, manufactured, in, standardised, package, layouts, to, make, them, easily, interchangeable, fuse, bodies, may, be, made, of, ceramic, glass, plastic, fiberglass, molded, mica, laminates, or, molded, compressed, fibre, depending, on, application, and, voltage, class, cartridge, ferrule, fuses, have, a, cylindrical, body, terminated, with, metal, end, caps, some, cartridge, fuses, are, manufactured, with, end, caps, of, different, sizes, to, prevent, accidental, insertion, of, the, wrong, fuse, rating, in, a, holder, giving, them, a, bottle, shape, fuses, for, low, voltage, power, circuits, may, have, bolted, blade, or, tag, terminals, which, are, secured, by, screws, to, a, fuseholder, some, blade, type, terminals, are, held, by, spring, clips, blade, type, fuses, often, require, the, use, of, a, special, purpose, extractor, tool, to, remove, them, from, the, fuse, holder, renewable, fuses, have, replaceable, fuse, elements, allowing, the, fuse, body, and, terminals, to, be, reused, if, not, damaged, after, a, fuse, operation, fuses, designed, for, soldering, to, a, printed, circuit, board, have, radial, or, axial, wire, leads, surface, mount, fuses, have, solder, pads, instead, of, leads, high, voltage, fuses, of, the, expulsion, type, have, fiber, or, glass, reinforced, plastic, tubes, and, an, open, end, and, can, have, the, fuse, element, replaced, semi, enclosed, fuses, are, fuse, wire, carriers, in, which, the, fusible, wire, itself, can, be, replaced, the, exact, fusing, current, is, not, as, well, controlled, as, an, enclosed, fuse, and, it, is, extremely, important, to, use, the, correct, diameter, and, material, when, replacing, the, fuse, wire, and, for, these, reasons, these, fuses, are, slowly, falling, from, favour, these, are, still, used, in, consumer, units, in, some, parts, of, the, world, but, are, becoming, less, common, while, glass, fuses, have, the, advantage, of, a, fuse, element, visible, for, inspection, purposes, they, have, a, low, breaking, capacity, interrupting, rating, which, generally, restricts, them, to, applications, of, 15, a, or, less, at, 250, v, ac, ceramic, fuses, have, the, advantage, of, a, higher, breaking, capacity, facilitating, their, use, in, circuits, with, higher, current, and, voltage, filling, a, fuse, body, with, sand, provides, additional, cooling, of, the, arc, and, increases, the, breaking, capacity, of, the, fuse, medium, voltage, fuses, may, have, liquid, filled, envelopes, to, assist, in, the, extinguishing, of, the, arc, some, types, of, distribution, switchgear, use, fuse, links, immersed, in, the, oil, that, fills, the, equipment, fuse, packages, may, include, a, rejection, feature, such, as, a, pin, slot, or, tab, which, prevents, interchange, of, otherwise, similar, appearing, fuses, for, example, fuse, holders, for, north, american, class, rk, fuses, have, a, pin, that, prevents, installation, of, similar, appearing, class, h, fuses, which, have, a, much, lower, breaking, capacity, and, a, solid, blade, terminal, that, lacks, the, slot, of, the, rk, type, fuses, can, be, built, with, different, sized, enclosures, to, prevent, interchange, of, different, ratings, of, fuse, for, example, bottle, style, fuses, distinguish, between, ratings, with, different, cap, diameters, automotive, glass, fuses, were, made, in, different, lengths, to, prevent, high, rated, fuses, being, installed, in, a, circuit, intended, for, a, lower, rating, glass, cartridge, and, plug, fuses, allow, direct, inspection, of, the, fusible, element, other, fuses, have, other, indication, methods, including, some, fuses, allow, a, special, purpose, micro, switch, or, relay, unit, to, be, fixed, to, the, fuse, body, when, the, fuse, element, blows, the, indicating, pin, extends, to, activate, the, micro, switch, or, relay, which, in, turn, triggers, an, event, some, fuses, for, medium, voltage, applications, use, two, or, three, separate, barrels, and, two, or, three, fuse, elements, in, parallel, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, publishes, standard, 60269, for, low, voltage, power, fuses, the, standard, is, in, four, volumes, which, describe, general, requirements, fuses, for, industrial, and, commercial, applications, fuses, for, residential, applications, and, fuses, to, protect, semiconductor, devices, the, iec, standard, unifies, several, national, standards, thereby, improving, the, interchangeability, of, fuses, in, international, trade, all, fuses, of, different, technologies, tested, to, meet, iec, standards, will, have, similar, time, current, characteristics, which, simplifies, design, and, maintenance, in, the, united, states, and, canada, low, voltage, fuses, to, 1, kv, ac, rating, are, made, in, accordance, with, underwriters, laboratories, standard, ul, 248, or, the, harmonized, canadian, standards, association, standard, c22, 2, no, 248, this, standard, applies, to, fuses, rated, 1, kv, or, less, ac, or, dc, and, with, breaking, capacity, up, to, 200, ka, these, fuses, are, intended, for, installations, following, canadian, electrical, code, part, i, cec, or, the, national, electrical, code, nfpa, 70, nec, the, standard, ampere, ratings, for, fuses, and, circuit, breakers, in, usa, canada, are, considered, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 5000, and, 6000, amperes, additional, standard, ampere, ratings, for, fuses, are, 1, 3, 6, 10, and, 601, ul, 248, currently, has, 19, parts, ul, 248, 1, sets, the, general, requirements, for, fuses, while, the, latter, parts, are, dedicated, to, specific, fuses, sizes, ex, 248, 8, for, class, j, 248, 10, for, class, l, or, for, categories, of, fuses, with, unique, properties, ex, 248, 13, for, semiconductor, fuses, 248, 19, for, photovoltaic, fuses, the, general, requirements, 248, 1, apply, except, as, modified, by, the, supplemental, part, 240, x, for, example, ul, 248, 19, allows, photovoltaic, fuses, to, be, rated, up, to, 1500, volts, dc, versus, 1000, volts, under, the, general, requirements, iec, and, ul, nomenclature, varies, slightly, iec, standards, refer, to, a, fuse, as, the, assembly, of, a, fusible, link, and, a, fuse, holder, in, north, american, standards, the, fuse, is, the, replaceable, portion, of, the, assembly, and, a, fuse, link, would, be, a, bare, metal, element, for, installation, in, a, fuse, automotive, fuses, are, used, to, protect, the, wiring, and, electrical, equipment, for, vehicles, there, are, several, different, types, of, automotive, fuses, and, their, usage, is, dependent, upon, the, specific, application, voltage, and, current, demands, of, the, electrical, circuit, automotive, fuses, can, be, mounted, in, fuse, blocks, inline, fuse, holders, or, fuse, clips, some, automotive, fuses, are, occasionally, used, in, non, automotive, electrical, applications, standards, for, automotive, fuses, are, published, by, sae, international, formerly, known, as, the, society, of, automotive, engineers, automotive, fuses, can, be, classified, into, four, distinct, categories, most, automotive, fuses, rated, at, 32, volts, are, used, on, circuits, rated, 24, volts, dc, and, below, some, vehicles, use, a, dual, 12, 42, v, dc, electrical, system, that, will, require, a, fuse, rated, at, 58, v, dc, fuses, are, used, on, power, systems, up, to, 115, 000, volts, ac, high, voltage, fuses, are, used, to, protect, instrument, transformers, used, for, electricity, metering, or, for, small, power, transformers, where, the, expense, of, a, circuit, breaker, is, not, warranted, a, circuit, breaker, at, 115, kv, may, cost, up, to, five, times, as, much, as, a, set, of, power, fuses, so, the, resulting, saving, can, be, tens, of, thousands, of, dollars, in, medium, voltage, distribution, systems, a, power, fuse, may, be, used, to, protect, a, transformer, serving, 1, 3, houses, pole, mounted, distribution, transformers, are, nearly, always, protected, by, a, fusible, cutout, which, can, have, the, fuse, element, replaced, using, live, line, maintenance, tools, medium, voltage, fuses, are, also, used, to, protect, motors, capacitor, banks, and, transformers, and, may, be, mounted, in, metal, enclosed, switchgear, or, rarely, in, new, designs, on, open, switchboards, large, power, fuses, use, fusible, elements, made, of, silver, copper, or, tin, to, provide, stable, and, predictable, performance, high, voltage, expulsion, fuses, surround, the, fusible, link, with, gas, evolving, substances, such, as, boric, acid, when, the, fuse, blows, heat, from, the, arc, causes, the, boric, acid, to, evolve, large, volumes, of, gases, the, associated, high, pressure, often, greater, than, 100, atmospheres, and, cooling, gases, rapidly, quench, the, resulting, arc, the, hot, gases, are, then, explosively, expelled, out, of, the, end, s, of, the, fuse, such, fuses, can, only, be, used, outdoors, these, type, of, fuses, may, have, an, impact, pin, to, operate, a, switch, mechanism, so, that, all, three, phases, are, interrupted, if, any, one, fuse, blows, high, power, fuse, means, that, these, fuses, can, interrupt, several, kiloamperes, some, manufacturers, have, tested, their, fuses, for, up, to, 63, ka, short, circuit, current, fuses, have, the, advantages, of, often, being, less, costly, and, simpler, than, a, circuit, breaker, for, similar, ratings, the, blown, fuse, must, be, replaced, with, a, new, device, which, is, less, convenient, than, simply, resetting, a, breaker, and, therefore, likely, to, discourage, people, from, ignoring, faults, on, the, other, hand, replacing, a, fuse, without, isolating, the, circuit, first, most, building, wiring, designs, do, not, provide, individual, isolation, switches, for, each, fuse, can, be, dangerous, in, itself, particularly, if, the, fault, is, a, short, circuit, in, terms, of, protection, response, time, fuses, tend, to, isolate, faults, more, quickly, depending, on, their, operating, time, than, circuit, breakers, a, fuse, can, clear, a, fault, within, a, quarter, cycle, of, the, fault, current, while, a, circuit, breaker, may, take, around, half, to, one, cycle, to, clear, the, fault, the, response, time, of, a, fuse, can, be, as, fast, as, 0, 002, seconds, whereas, a, circuit, breaker, typically, responds, in, the, range, of, 0, 02, to, 0, 05, seconds, high, rupturing, capacity, fuses, can, be, rated, to, safely, interrupt, up, to, 300, 000, amperes, at, 600, v, ac, special, current, limiting, fuses, are, applied, ahead, of, some, molded, case, breakers, to, protect, the, breakers, in, low, voltage, power, circuits, with, high, short, circuit, levels, current, limiting, fuses, operate, so, quickly, that, they, limit, the, total, let, through, energy, that, passes, into, the, circuit, helping, to, protect, downstream, equipment, from, damage, these, fuses, open, in, less, than, one, cycle, of, the, ac, power, frequency, circuit, breakers, cannot, match, this, speed, some, types, of, circuit, breakers, must, be, maintained, on, a, regular, basis, to, ensure, their, mechanical, operation, during, an, interruption, this, is, not, the, case, with, fuses, which, rely, on, melting, processes, where, no, mechanical, operation, is, required, for, the, fuse, to, operate, under, fault, conditions, in, a, multi, phase, power, circuit, if, only, one, fuse, opens, the, remaining, phases, will, have, higher, than, normal, currents, and, unbalanced, voltages, with, possible, damage, to, motors, fuses, only, sense, overcurrent, or, to, a, degree, over, temperature, and, cannot, usually, be, used, independently, with, protective, relaying, to, provide, more, advanced, protective, functions, for, example, ground, fault, detection, some, manufacturers, of, medium, voltage, distribution, fuses, combine, the, overcurrent, protection, characteristics, of, the, fusible, element, with, the, flexibility, of, relay, protection, by, adding, a, pyrotechnic, device, to, the, fuse, operated, by, external, protective, relays, for, domestic, applications, miniature, circuit, breakers, mcb, are, widely, used, as, an, alternative, to, fuses, their, rated, current, depend, on, the, load, current, of, the, equipment, to, be, protected, and, the, ambient, operational, temperature, they, are, available, in, the, following, ratings, 6a, 10a, 16a, 20a, 25a, 32a, 45a, 50a, 63a, 80a, 100a, 125a, in, the, uk, older, electrical, consumer, units, also, called, fuse, boxes, are, fitted, either, with, semi, enclosed, rewirable, fuses, bs, 3036, or, cartridge, fuses, bs, 1361, fuse, wire, is, commonly, supplied, to, consumers, as, short, lengths, of, 5, a, 15, a, and, 30, a, rated, wire, wound, on, a, piece, of, cardboard, modern, consumer, units, usually, contain, miniature, circuit, breakers, mcbs, instead, of, fuses, though, cartridge, fuses, are, sometimes, still, used, as, in, some, applications, mcbs, are, prone, to, nuisance, tripping, renewable, fuses, rewirable, or, cartridge, allow, user, replacement, but, this, can, be, hazardous, as, it, is, easy, to, put, a, higher, rated, or, double, fuse, element, link, or, wire, into, the, holder, overfusing, or, simply, fitting, it, with, copper, wire, or, even, a, totally, different, type, of, conducting, object, coins, hairpins, paper, clips, nails, etc, to, the, existing, carrier, one, form, of, fuse, box, abuse, was, to, put, a, penny, in, the, socket, which, defeated, overcurrent, protection, and, resulted, in, a, dangerous, condition, such, tampering, will, not, be, visible, without, full, inspection, of, the, fuse, fuse, wire, was, never, used, in, north, america, for, this, reason, although, renewable, fuses, continue, to, be, made, for, distribution, boards, the, wylex, standard, consumer, unit, was, very, popular, in, the, united, kingdom, until, the, wiring, regulations, started, demanding, residual, current, devices, rcds, for, sockets, that, could, feasibly, supply, equipment, outside, the, equipotential, zone, the, design, does, not, allow, for, fitting, of, rcds, or, rcbos, some, wylex, standard, models, were, made, with, an, rcd, instead, of, the, main, switch, but, for, consumer, units, supplying, the, entire, installation, this, is, no, longer, compliant, with, the, wiring, regulations, as, alarm, systems, should, not, be, rcd, protected, there, are, two, styles, of, fuse, base, that, can, be, screwed, into, these, units, one, designed, for, rewirable, fusewire, carriers, and, one, designed, for, cartridge, fuse, carriers, over, the, years, mcbs, have, been, made, for, both, styles, of, base, in, both, cases, higher, rated, carriers, had, wider, pins, so, a, carrier, couldn, t, be, changed, for, a, higher, rated, one, without, also, changing, the, base, cartridge, fuse, carriers, are, also, now, available, for, din, rail, enclosures, in, north, america, fuses, were, used, in, buildings, wired, before, 1960, these, edison, base, fuses, would, screw, into, a, fuse, socket, similar, to, edison, base, incandescent, lamps, ratings, were, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and, 30, amperes, to, prevent, installation, of, fuses, with, an, excessive, current, rating, later, fuse, boxes, included, rejection, features, in, the, fuse, holder, socket, commonly, known, as, rejection, base, type, s, fuses, which, have, smaller, diameters, that, vary, depending, on, the, rating, of, the, fuse, this, means, that, fuses, can, only, be, replaced, by, the, preset, type, s, fuse, rating, this, is, a, north, american, tri, national, standard, ul, 4248, 11, can, csa, c22, 2, no, 4248, 11, 07, r2012, and, nmx, j, 009, 4248, 11, ance, existing, edison, fuse, boards, can, easily, be, converted, to, only, accept, rejection, base, type, s, fuses, by, screwing, in, a, tamper, proof, adapter, this, adapter, screws, into, the, existing, edison, fuse, holder, and, has, a, smaller, diameter, threaded, hole, to, accept, the, designated, type, s, rated, fuse, some, companies, manufacture, resettable, miniature, thermal, circuit, breakers, which, screw, into, a, fuse, socket, some, installations, use, these, edison, base, circuit, breakers, however, any, such, breaker, sold, today, does, have, one, flaw, it, may, be, installed, in, a, circuit, breaker, box, with, a, door, if, so, if, the, door, is, closed, the, door, may, hold, down, the, breaker, s, reset, button, while, in, this, state, the, breaker, is, effectively, useless, it, does, not, provide, any, overcurrent, protection, in, the, 1950s, fuses, in, new, residential, or, industrial, construction, for, branch, circuit, protection, were, superseded, by, low, voltage, circuit, breakers, fuses, are, widely, used, for, protection, of, electric, motor, circuits, for, small, overloads, the, motor, protection, circuit, will, open, the, controlling, contactor, automatically, and, the, fuse, will, only, operate, for, short, circuits, or, extreme, overload, where, several, fuses, are, connected, in, series, at, the, various, levels, of, a, power, distribution, system, it, is, desirable, to, blow, clear, only, the, fuse, or, other, overcurrent, device, electrically, closest, to, the, fault, this, process, is, called, coordination, and, may, require, the, time, current, characteristics, of, two, fuses, to, be, plotted, on, a, common, current, basis, fuses, are, selected, so, that, the, minor, branch, fuse, disconnects, its, circuit, well, before, the, supplying, feeder, fuse, starts, to, melt, in, this, way, only, the, faulty, circuit, is, interrupted, with, minimal, disturbance, to, other, circuits, fed, by, a, common, supplying, fuse, where, the, fuses, in, a, system, are, of, similar, types, simple, rule, of, thumb, ratios, between, ratings, of, the, fuse, closest, to, the, load, and, the, next, fuse, towards, the, source, can, be, used, so, called, self, resetting, fuses, use, a, thermoplastic, conductive, element, known, as, a, polymeric, positive, temperature, coefficient, pptc, thermistor, that, impedes, the, circuit, during, an, overcurrent, condition, by, increasing, device, resistance, the, pptc, thermistor, is, self, resetting, in, that, when, current, is, removed, the, device, will, cool, and, revert, to, low, resistance, these, devices, are, often, used, in, aerospace, nuclear, applications, where, replacement, is, difficult, or, on, a, computer, motherboard, so, that, a, shorted, mouse, or, keyboard, does, not, cause, motherboard, damage, a, thermal, fuse, is, often, found, in, consumer, equipment, such, as, coffee, makers, hair, dryers, or, transformers, powering, small, consumer, electronics, devices, they, contain, a, fusible, temperature, sensitive, composition, which, holds, a, spring, contact, mechanism, normally, closed, when, the, surrounding, temperature, gets, too, high, the, composition, melts, and, allows, the, spring, contact, mechanism, to, break, the, circuit, the, device, can, be, used, to, prevent, a, fire, in, a, hair, dryer, for, example, by, cutting, off, the, power, supply, to, the, heater, elements, when, the, air, flow, is, interrupted, e, g, the, blower, motor, stops, or, the, air, intake, becomes, accidentally, blocked, thermal, fuses, are, a, one, shot, non, resettable, device, which, must, be, replaced, once, they, have, been, activated, blown, a, cable, limiter, is, similar, to, a, fuse, but, is, intended, only, for, protection, of, low, voltage, power, cables, it, is, used, for, example, in, networks, where, multiple, cables, may, be, used, in, parallel, it, is, not, intended, to, provide, overload, protection, but, instead, protects, a, cable, that, is, exposed, to, a, short, circuit, the, characteristics, of, the, limiter, are, matched, to, the, size, of, cable, so, that, the, limiter, clears, a, fault, before, the, cable, insulation, is, damaged, the, unicode, character, for, the, fuse, s, schematic, symbol, found, in, the, miscellaneous, technical, block, is, u, 23db
