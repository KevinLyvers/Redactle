an, elevator, american, english, or, lift, commonwealth, english, is, a, machine, that, vertically, transports, people, or, freight, between, levels, they, are, typically, powered, by, electric, motors, that, drive, traction, cables, and, counterweight, systems, such, as, a, hoist, although, some, pump, hydraulic, fluid, to, raise, a, cylindrical, piston, like, a, jack, in, agriculture, and, manufacturing, an, elevator, is, any, type, of, conveyor, device, used, to, lift, materials, in, a, continuous, stream, into, bins, or, silos, several, types, exist, such, as, the, chain, and, bucket, elevator, grain, auger, screw, conveyor, using, the, principle, of, archimedes, screw, or, the, chain, and, paddles, or, forks, of, hay, elevators, languages, other, than, english, such, as, japanese, may, refer, to, elevators, by, loanwords, based, on, either, elevator, or, lift, wheelchair, access, laws, often, require, elevators, in, new, multistory, buildings, especially, where, wheelchair, ramps, are, not, possible, high, speed, elevators, are, elevators, that, move, faster, than, regular, elevators, and, are, common, in, skyscrapers, and, towers, some, elevators, can, also, travel, horizontally, in, addition, to, the, usual, vertical, motion, the, earliest, known, reference, to, an, elevator, is, in, the, works, of, the, roman, architect, vitruvius, who, reported, that, archimedes, c, 287, bc, c, 212, bc, built, his, first, elevator, probably, in, 236, bc, sources, from, later, periods, mention, elevators, as, cabs, on, a, hemp, rope, powered, by, people, or, animals, the, roman, colosseum, completed, in, 80, ad, had, roughly, 25, elevators, that, were, used, for, raising, animals, up, to, the, floor, each, elevator, could, carry, about, 600, pounds, 270, kg, roughly, the, weight, of, two, lions, 23, feet, 7, 0, m, up, when, powered, by, up, to, eight, men, in, 1000, the, book, of, secrets, by, ibn, khalaf, al, muradi, in, islamic, spain, described, the, use, of, an, elevator, like, lifting, device, to, raise, a, large, battering, ram, to, destroy, a, fortress, in, the, 17th, century, prototypes, of, elevators, were, installed, in, the, palace, buildings, of, england, and, france, louis, xv, of, france, had, a, so, called, flying, chair, built, for, one, of, his, mistresses, at, the, ch, teau, de, versailles, in, 1743, ancient, and, medieval, elevators, used, drive, systems, based, on, hoists, and, windlasses, the, invention, of, a, system, based, on, the, screw, drive, was, perhaps, the, most, important, step, in, elevator, technology, since, ancient, times, leading, to, the, creation, of, modern, passenger, elevators, the, first, screw, drive, elevator, was, built, by, ivan, kulibin, and, installed, in, the, winter, palace, in, 1793, although, there, may, have, been, an, earlier, design, by, leonardo, da, vinci, several, years, later, another, of, kulibin, s, elevators, was, installed, in, the, arkhangelskoye, near, moscow, the, development, of, elevators, was, led, by, the, need, for, movement, of, raw, materials, including, coal, and, lumber, from, hillsides, the, technology, developed, by, these, industries, and, the, introduction, of, steel, beam, construction, worked, together, to, provide, the, passenger, and, freight, elevators, in, use, today, starting, in, coal, mines, elevators, in, the, mid, 19th, century, operated, with, steam, power, and, were, used, for, moving, goods, in, bulk, in, mines, and, factories, these, devices, were, soon, applied, to, a, diverse, set, of, purposes, in, 1823, burton, and, homer, two, architects, in, london, built, and, operated, a, novel, tourist, attraction, which, they, called, the, ascending, room, which, elevated, customers, to, a, considerable, height, in, the, center, of, london, providing, a, panoramic, view, early, crude, steam, driven, elevators, were, refined, in, the, ensuing, decade, in, 1835, an, innovative, elevator, the, teagle, was, developed, by, the, company, frost, and, stutt, in, england, it, was, belt, driven, and, used, a, counterweight, for, extra, power, in, 1845, neapolitan, architect, gaetano, genovese, installed, in, the, royal, palace, of, caserta, the, flying, chair, an, elevator, ahead, of, its, time, covered, with, chestnut, wood, outside, and, with, maple, wood, inside, it, included, a, light, two, benches, and, a, hand, operated, signal, and, could, be, activated, from, the, outside, without, any, effort, by, the, occupants, traction, was, controlled, by, a, motor, mechanic, utilizing, a, system, of, toothed, wheels, a, safety, system, was, designed, to, take, effect, if, the, cords, broke, consisting, of, a, beam, pushed, outwards, by, a, steel, spring, the, hydraulic, crane, was, invented, by, sir, william, armstrong, in, 1846, primarily, for, use, at, the, tyneside, docks, for, loading, cargo, they, quickly, supplanted, the, earlier, steam, driven, elevators, exploiting, pascal, s, law, to, provide, much, greater, force, a, water, pump, supplied, a, variable, level, of, water, pressure, to, a, plunger, encased, inside, a, vertical, cylinder, allowing, the, platform, carrying, a, heavy, load, to, be, raised, and, lowered, counterweights, and, balances, were, also, used, to, increase, lifting, power, henry, waterman, of, new, york, is, credited, with, inventing, the, standing, rope, control, for, an, elevator, in, 1850, in, 1852, elisha, otis, introduced, the, safety, elevator, which, prevented, the, fall, of, the, cab, if, the, cable, broke, he, demonstrated, it, at, the, new, york, exposition, in, the, crystal, palace, in, a, dramatic, death, defying, presentation, in, 1854, and, the, first, such, passenger, elevator, was, installed, at, 488, broadway, in, new, york, city, on, 23, march, 1857, the, first, elevator, shaft, preceded, the, first, elevator, by, four, years, construction, for, peter, cooper, s, cooper, union, foundation, building, in, new, york, began, in, 1853, an, elevator, shaft, was, included, in, the, design, because, cooper, was, confident, that, a, safe, passenger, elevator, would, soon, be, invented, the, shaft, was, cylindrical, because, cooper, thought, it, was, the, most, efficient, design, otis, later, designed, a, special, elevator, for, the, building, peter, ellis, an, english, architect, installed, the, first, elevators, that, could, be, described, as, paternoster, elevators, in, oriel, chambers, in, liverpool, in, 1868, the, equitable, life, building, completed, in, 1870, in, new, york, city, is, thought, to, be, the, first, office, building, with, passenger, elevators, in, 1872, american, inventor, james, wayland, patented, a, novel, method, of, securing, elevator, shafts, with, doors, that, are, automatically, opened, and, closed, as, the, elevator, car, approaches, and, leaves, them, in, 1874, j, w, meaker, patented, a, method, permitting, elevator, doors, to, open, and, close, safely, the, first, electric, elevator, was, built, by, werner, von, siemens, in, 1880, in, germany, inventor, anton, freissler, further, developed, von, siemens, ideas, and, created, a, successful, elevator, enterprise, in, austria, hungary, the, safety, and, speed, of, electric, elevators, were, significantly, enhanced, by, frank, sprague, who, added, floor, control, automatic, operation, acceleration, control, and, further, safety, devices, his, elevator, ran, faster, and, with, larger, loads, than, hydraulic, or, steam, elevators, 584, of, sprague, s, elevators, were, installed, before, he, sold, his, company, to, the, otis, elevator, company, in, 1895, sprague, also, developed, the, idea, and, technology, for, multiple, elevators, in, a, single, shaft, in, 1871, when, hydraulic, power, was, a, well, established, technology, edward, b, ellington, founded, wharves, and, warehouses, steam, power, and, hydraulic, pressure, company, which, became, the, london, hydraulic, power, company, in, 1883, it, constructed, a, network, of, high, pressure, mains, on, both, sides, of, the, thames, which, ultimately, extended, 184, miles, 296, km, and, powered, some, 8, 000, machines, predominantly, elevators, and, cranes, schuyler, wheeler, patented, his, electric, elevator, design, in, 1883, in, 1884, american, inventor, d, humphreys, of, norfolk, virginia, patented, an, elevator, with, automatic, doors, that, closed, off, the, elevator, shaft, when, the, car, was, not, being, entered, or, exited, in, 1887, american, inventor, alexander, miles, of, duluth, minnesota, patented, an, elevator, with, automatic, doors, that, closed, off, the, elevator, shaft, when, the, car, was, not, being, entered, or, exited, in, 1891, american, inventors, joseph, kelly, and, william, l, woods, co, patented, a, novel, way, to, guard, elevator, shafts, against, accident, by, way, of, hatches, that, would, automatically, open, and, close, as, the, car, passed, through, them, the, first, elevator, in, india, was, installed, at, the, raj, bhavan, in, kolkata, by, otis, in, 1892, by, 1900, completely, automated, elevators, were, available, but, passengers, were, reluctant, to, use, them, their, adoption, was, aided, by, a, 1945, elevator, operator, strike, in, new, york, city, and, the, addition, of, an, emergency, stop, button, emergency, telephone, and, a, soothing, explanatory, automated, voice, an, inverter, controlled, gearless, drive, system, is, applied, in, high, speed, elevators, worldwide, the, toshiba, company, continued, research, on, thyristors, for, use, in, inverter, control, and, dramatically, enhanced, their, switching, capacity, resulting, in, the, development, of, insulated, gate, bipolar, transistors, igbts, at, the, end, of, the, 1980s, the, igbt, realized, increased, switching, frequency, and, reduced, magnetic, noise, in, the, motor, eliminating, the, need, for, a, filter, circuit, and, allowing, a, more, compact, system, the, igbt, also, allowed, the, development, of, a, small, highly, integrated, highly, sophisticated, all, digital, control, device, consisting, of, a, high, speed, processor, specially, customized, gate, arrays, and, a, circuit, capable, of, controlling, large, currents, of, several, khz, in, 2000, the, first, vacuum, elevator, was, offered, commercially, in, argentina, some, people, argue, that, elevators, began, as, simple, rope, or, chain, hoists, see, traction, elevators, below, an, elevator, is, essentially, a, platform, that, is, either, pulled, or, pushed, up, by, mechanical, means, a, modern, day, elevator, consists, of, a, cab, also, called, a, cabin, cage, carriage, or, car, mounted, on, a, platform, within, an, enclosed, space, called, a, shaft, or, sometimes, a, hoistway, in, the, past, elevator, drive, mechanisms, were, powered, by, steam, and, water, hydraulic, pistons, or, by, hand, in, a, traction, elevator, cars, are, pulled, up, by, means, of, rolling, steel, ropes, over, a, deeply, grooved, pulley, commonly, called, a, sheave, in, the, industry, the, weight, of, the, car, is, balanced, by, a, counterweight, oftentimes, two, elevators, or, sometimes, three, are, built, so, that, their, cars, always, move, synchronously, in, opposite, directions, and, are, each, other, s, counterweight, the, friction, between, the, ropes, and, the, pulley, furnishes, the, traction, which, gives, this, type, of, elevator, its, name, hydraulic, elevators, use, the, principles, of, hydraulics, in, the, sense, of, hydraulic, power, to, pressurize, an, above, ground, or, in, ground, piston, to, raise, and, lower, the, car, see, hydraulic, elevators, below, roped, hydraulics, use, a, combination, of, both, ropes, and, hydraulic, power, to, raise, and, lower, cars, recent, innovations, include, permanent, magnet, motors, machine, room, less, rail, mounted, gearless, machines, and, microprocessor, controls, the, technology, used, in, new, installations, depends, on, a, variety, of, factors, hydraulic, elevators, are, cheaper, but, installing, cylinders, greater, than, a, certain, length, becomes, impractical, for, very, high, lift, hoistways, for, buildings, of, much, over, seven, floors, traction, elevators, must, be, employed, instead, hydraulic, elevators, are, usually, slower, than, traction, elevators, elevators, are, a, candidate, for, mass, customization, there, are, economies, to, be, made, from, mass, production, of, the, components, but, each, building, comes, with, its, own, requirements, like, different, number, of, floors, dimensions, of, the, well, and, usage, patterns, elevator, doors, prevent, riders, from, falling, into, entering, or, tampering, with, anything, in, the, shaft, the, most, common, configuration, is, to, have, two, panels, that, meet, in, the, middle, and, slide, open, laterally, these, are, known, as, center, opening, in, a, cascading, telescopic, configuration, potentially, allowing, wider, entryways, within, limited, space, the, doors, roll, on, independent, tracks, so, that, while, open, they, are, tucked, behind, one, another, and, while, closed, they, form, cascading, layers, on, one, side, this, can, be, configured, so, that, two, sets, of, such, cascading, doors, operate, like, the, center, opening, doors, described, above, allowing, for, a, very, wide, elevator, cab, in, less, expensive, installations, the, elevator, can, also, use, one, large, slab, door, a, single, panel, door, the, width, of, the, doorway, that, opens, to, the, left, or, right, laterally, these, are, known, as, single, slide, doors, some, buildings, have, elevators, with, the, single, door, on, the, shaftway, and, double, cascading, doors, on, the, cab, elevators, that, do, not, require, separate, machine, rooms, are, designed, so, that, most, of, their, power, and, control, components, fit, within, the, hoistway, the, shaft, containing, the, elevator, car, and, a, small, cabinet, houses, the, controller, the, equipment, is, otherwise, similar, to, that, of, a, normal, traction, or, hole, less, hydraulic, elevator, the, world, s, first, machine, room, less, elevator, the, kone, monospace, was, introduced, in, the, year, 1996, by, kone, compared, to, traditional, elevators, it, its, disadvantage, was, that, it, could, be, harder, and, significantly, more, dangerous, to, service, and, maintain, double, decker, elevators, are, traction, elevators, with, cars, that, have, an, upper, and, lower, deck, both, decks, which, can, serve, a, floor, at, the, same, time, are, usually, driven, by, the, same, motor, the, system, increases, efficiency, in, high, rise, buildings, and, saves, space, so, additional, shafts, and, cars, are, not, required, in, 2003, tk, elevator, invented, a, system, called, twin, with, two, elevator, cars, independently, running, in, one, shaft, in, 1901, consulting, engineer, charles, g, darrach, 1846, 1927, proposed, the, first, formula, to, determine, elevator, service, in, 1908, reginald, p, bolton, published, the, first, book, devoted, to, this, subject, elevator, service, the, summation, of, his, work, was, a, massive, fold, out, chart, placed, at, the, back, of, his, book, that, allowed, users, to, determine, the, number, of, express, and, local, elevators, needed, for, a, given, building, to, meet, a, desired, interval, of, service, in, 1912, commercial, engineer, edmund, f, tweedy, and, electrical, engineer, arthur, williams, co, authored, a, book, titled, commercial, engineering, for, central, stations, he, followed, bolton, s, lead, and, developed, a, chart, for, determining, the, number, and, size, of, elevators, required, for, office, buildings, of, a, given, total, occupied, floor, area, in, 1920, howard, b, cook, presented, a, paper, titled, passenger, elevator, service, this, paper, marked, the, first, time, a, member, of, the, elevator, industry, offered, a, mathematical, means, of, determining, elevator, service, his, formula, determined, the, round, trip, time, rtt, by, finding, the, single, trip, time, doubling, it, and, adding, 10, seconds, in, 1923, bassett, jones, published, an, article, titled, the, probable, number, of, stops, made, by, an, elevator, he, based, his, equations, on, the, theory, of, probabilities, and, found, a, reasonably, accurate, method, of, calculating, the, average, stop, count, the, equation, in, this, article, assumed, a, consistent, population, on, every, floor, he, went, on, to, write, an, updated, version, of, his, equations, in, 1926, which, accounted, for, variable, population, on, each, floor, jones, credited, david, lindquist, for, the, development, of, the, equation, but, provides, no, indication, as, to, when, it, was, first, proposed, although, the, equations, were, there, elevator, traffic, analysis, was, still, a, very, specialist, task, that, could, only, be, done, by, world, experts, that, was, until, 1967, when, strakosch, wrote, an, eight, step, method, for, finding, the, efficiency, of, a, system, in, vertical, transportation, elevators, and, escalators, in, 1975, barney, and, dos, santos, developed, and, published, the, round, trip, time, rtt, formula, which, followed, strakosch, s, work, this, was, the, first, formulized, mathematical, model, and, is, the, simplest, form, that, is, still, used, by, traffic, analyzers, today, modification, and, improvements, have, been, made, to, this, equation, over, the, years, most, significantly, in, 2000, when, peters, published, improvements, to, the, up, peak, round, trip, time, calculation, which, improved, the, accuracy, of, the, flight, time, calculation, making, allowances, for, short, elevator, journeys, when, the, car, does, not, reach, maximum, rated, speed, or, acceleration, and, added, the, functionality, of, express, zones, this, equation, is, now, referred, to, as, the, up, peak, calculation, as, it, uses, the, assumption, that, all, the, passengers, are, coming, into, the, building, from, the, ground, floor, incoming, traffic, and, that, there, are, no, passengers, traveling, from, a, higher, floor, to, the, ground, floor, outgoing, traffic, and, no, passengers, traveling, from, one, internal, floor, to, another, interfloor, traffic, this, model, works, well, if, a, building, is, at, its, most, busy, first, thing, in, the, morning, however, in, more, complicated, elevator, systems, this, model, does, not, work, in, 1990, peters, published, a, paper, titled, lift, traffic, analysis, formulae, for, the, general, case, in, which, he, developed, a, new, formula, which, would, account, for, mixed, traffic, patterns, as, well, as, accounting, for, passenger, bunching, using, poisson, approximation, this, new, general, analysis, equation, enabled, much, more, complex, systems, to, be, analyzed, however, the, equations, had, now, become, so, complex, that, it, was, almost, impossible, to, do, manually, and, it, became, necessary, to, use, software, to, run, the, calculations, the, ga, formula, was, extended, even, further, in, 1996, to, account, for, double, deck, elevators, rtt, calculations, establish, an, elevator, system, s, handling, capacity, by, using, a, set, of, repeatable, calculations, which, for, a, given, set, of, inputs, always, produce, the, same, answer, it, works, well, for, simple, systems, but, as, systems, get, more, complex, the, calculations, are, harder, to, develop, and, implement, for, very, complex, systems, the, solution, is, to, simulate, the, building, in, this, method, a, virtual, version, of, a, building, is, created, on, a, computer, modeling, passengers, and, elevators, as, realistically, as, possible, and, random, numbers, are, used, to, model, probability, rather, than, mathematical, equations, and, percentage, probability, dispatcher, based, simulation, has, had, major, improvements, over, the, years, but, the, principle, remains, the, same, the, most, widely, used, simulator, elevate, was, first, showcased, in, 1998, as, elevate, lite, although, it, is, currently, the, most, accurate, method, of, modeling, an, elevator, system, the, method, does, have, drawbacks, unlike, calculations, it, does, not, find, a, rtt, value, because, it, does, not, run, standard, round, trips, thus, it, does, not, conform, with, standardized, elevator, traffic, analysis, methodology, and, cannot, be, used, to, find, values, such, as, average, interval, instead, it, is, generally, used, to, find, the, average, waiting, time, at, the, first, elevator, and, escalator, symposium, in, 2011, al, sharif, proposed, an, alternative, form, of, simulation, that, modeled, a, car, s, single, round, trip, before, restarting, and, running, again, this, method, is, still, capable, of, modeling, complex, systems, and, also, conforms, with, standard, methodology, by, producing, an, rtt, value, the, model, was, improved, further, in, 2018, when, al, sharif, demonstrated, a, way, to, reintroduce, a, dispatcher, like, function, which, can, model, destination, control, systems, while, this, does, successfully, remove, simulation, s, major, drawback, it, is, not, quite, as, accurate, as, dispatcher, based, simulations, given, its, simplifications, and, non, continual, nature, the, monte, carlo, method, also, requires, passenger, count, as, an, input, rather, than, passengers, per, second, in, other, methodologies, elevators, can, be, rope, dependent, or, rope, free, there, are, at, least, four, means, of, moving, an, elevator, geared, traction, machines, are, driven, by, ac, or, dc, electric, motors, geared, machines, use, worm, gears, to, control, mechanical, movement, of, elevator, cars, by, rolling, steel, hoist, ropes, over, a, drive, sheave, which, is, attached, to, a, gearbox, driven, by, a, high, speed, motor, these, machines, are, generally, the, best, option, for, basement, or, overhead, traction, use, for, speeds, up, to, 3, m, s, 500, ft, min, historically, ac, motors, were, used, for, single, or, double, speed, elevator, machines, on, the, grounds, of, cost, and, lower, usage, applications, where, car, speed, and, passenger, comfort, were, less, of, an, issue, but, for, higher, speed, larger, capacity, elevators, the, need, for, infinitely, variable, speed, control, over, the, traction, machine, becomes, an, issue, therefore, dc, machines, powered, by, an, ac, dc, motor, generator, were, the, preferred, solution, the, mg, set, also, typically, powered, the, relay, controller, of, the, elevator, which, has, the, added, advantage, of, electrically, isolating, the, elevators, from, the, rest, of, a, building, s, electrical, system, thus, eliminating, the, transient, power, spikes, in, the, building, s, electrical, supply, caused, by, the, motors, starting, and, stopping, causing, lighting, to, dim, every, time, the, elevators, are, used, for, example, as, well, as, interference, to, other, electrical, equipment, caused, by, the, arcing, of, the, relay, contactors, in, the, control, system, the, widespread, availability, of, variable, frequency, ac, drives, has, allowed, ac, motors, to, be, used, universally, bringing, with, it, the, advantages, of, the, older, motor, generator, dc, based, systems, without, the, penalties, in, terms, of, efficiency, and, complexity, the, older, mg, based, installations, are, gradually, being, replaced, in, older, buildings, due, to, their, poor, energy, efficiency, gearless, traction, machines, are, low, speed, low, rpm, high, torque, electric, motors, powered, either, by, ac, or, dc, in, this, case, the, drive, sheave, is, directly, attached, to, the, end, of, the, motor, gearless, traction, elevators, can, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 20, m, s, 4, 000, ft, min, a, brake, is, mounted, between, the, motor, and, gearbox, or, between, the, motor, and, drive, sheave, or, at, the, end, of, the, drive, sheave, to, hold, the, elevator, stationary, at, a, floor, this, brake, is, usually, an, external, drum, type, and, is, actuated, by, spring, force, and, held, open, electrically, a, power, failure, will, cause, the, brake, to, engage, and, prevent, the, elevator, from, falling, see, inherent, safety, and, safety, engineering, but, it, can, also, be, some, form, of, disc, type, like, one, or, more, calipers, over, a, disc, in, one, end, of, the, motor, shaft, or, drive, sheave, which, is, used, in, high, speed, high, rise, and, large, capacity, elevators, with, machine, rooms, an, exception, is, the, kone, monospace, s, ecodisc, which, is, not, high, speed, high, rise, and, large, capacity, and, is, machine, room, less, but, it, uses, the, same, design, as, is, a, thinner, version, of, a, conventional, gearless, traction, machine, for, braking, power, compactness, and, redundancy, assuming, there, are, at, least, two, calipers, on, the, disc, or, one, or, more, disc, brakes, with, a, single, caliper, at, one, end, of, the, motor, shaft, or, drive, sheave, which, is, used, in, machine, room, less, elevators, for, compactness, braking, power, and, redundancy, assuming, there, are, two, or, more, brakes, in, each, case, steel, or, kevlar, cables, are, attached, to, a, hitch, plate, on, top, of, the, cab, or, may, be, underslung, below, a, cab, and, then, looped, over, the, drive, sheave, to, a, counterweight, attached, to, the, opposite, end, of, the, cables, which, reduces, the, amount, of, power, needed, to, move, the, cab, the, counterweight, is, located, in, the, hoist, way, and, is, carried, along, a, separate, railway, system, as, the, car, goes, up, the, counterweight, goes, down, and, vice, versa, this, action, is, powered, by, the, traction, machine, which, is, directed, by, the, controller, typically, a, relay, logic, or, computerized, device, that, directs, starting, acceleration, deceleration, and, stopping, of, the, elevator, cab, the, weight, of, the, counterweight, is, typically, equal, to, the, weight, of, the, elevator, cab, plus, 40, 50, of, the, capacity, of, the, elevator, the, grooves, in, the, drive, sheave, are, specially, designed, to, prevent, the, cables, from, slipping, traction, is, provided, to, the, ropes, by, the, grip, of, the, grooves, in, the, sheave, thereby, the, name, as, the, ropes, age, and, the, traction, grooves, wear, some, traction, is, lost, and, the, ropes, must, be, replaced, and, the, sheave, repaired, or, replaced, sheave, and, rope, wear, may, be, significantly, reduced, by, ensuring, that, all, ropes, have, equal, tension, thus, sharing, the, load, evenly, rope, tension, equalization, may, be, achieved, using, a, rope, tension, gauge, and, is, a, simple, way, to, extend, the, lifetime, of, the, sheaves, and, ropes, elevators, with, more, than, 30, m, 98, ft, of, travel, have, a, system, called, compensation, this, is, a, separate, set, of, cables, or, a, chain, attached, to, the, bottom, of, the, counterweight, and, the, bottom, of, the, elevator, cab, this, makes, it, easier, to, control, the, elevator, as, it, compensates, for, the, differing, weight, of, cable, between, the, hoist, and, the, cab, if, the, elevator, cab, is, at, the, top, of, the, hoist, way, there, is, a, short, length, of, hoist, cable, above, the, car, and, a, long, length, of, compensating, cable, below, the, car, and, vice, versa, for, the, counterweight, if, the, compensation, system, uses, cables, there, will, be, an, additional, sheave, in, the, pit, below, the, elevator, to, guide, the, cables, if, the, compensation, system, uses, chains, the, chain, is, guided, by, a, bar, mounted, between, the, counterweight, tracks, another, energy, saving, improvement, is, the, regenerative, drive, which, works, analogously, to, regenerative, braking, in, vehicles, using, the, elevator, s, electric, motor, as, a, generator, to, capture, some, of, the, gravitational, potential, energy, of, descent, of, a, full, cab, heavier, than, its, counterweight, or, ascent, of, an, empty, cab, lighter, than, its, counterweight, and, return, it, to, the, building, s, electrical, system, the, low, mechanical, complexity, of, hydraulic, elevators, in, comparison, to, traction, elevators, makes, them, ideal, for, low, rise, low, traffic, installations, they, are, less, energy, efficient, as, the, pump, works, against, gravity, to, push, the, car, and, its, passengers, upwards, this, energy, is, lost, when, the, car, descends, on, its, own, weight, the, high, current, draw, of, the, pump, when, starting, up, also, places, higher, demands, on, a, building, s, electrical, system, there, are, also, environmental, concerns, should, the, lifting, cylinder, leak, fluid, into, the, ground, hence, the, development, of, holeless, hydraulic, elevators, which, also, eliminate, the, need, for, a, relatively, deep, hole, in, the, bottom, of, the, elevator, shaft, cable, free, elevators, using, electromagnetic, propulsion, capable, of, moving, both, vertically, and, horizontally, have, been, developed, by, german, engineering, firm, thyssen, krupp, for, use, in, high, rise, high, density, buildings, a, climbing, elevator, is, a, self, ascending, elevator, with, its, own, propulsion, the, propulsion, can, be, done, by, an, electric, or, a, combustion, engine, climbing, elevators, are, used, in, guyed, masts, or, towers, in, order, to, make, easy, access, to, parts, of, these, constructions, such, as, flight, safety, lamps, for, maintenance, an, example, would, be, the, moonlight, towers, in, austin, texas, where, the, elevator, holds, only, one, person, and, equipment, for, maintenance, the, glasgow, tower, an, observation, tower, in, glasgow, scotland, also, makes, use, of, two, climbing, elevators, temporary, climbing, elevators, are, commonly, used, in, the, construction, of, new, high, rise, buildings, to, move, materials, and, personnel, before, the, building, s, permanent, elevator, system, is, installed, at, which, point, the, climbing, elevators, are, dismantled, an, elevator, of, this, kind, uses, a, vacuum, on, top, of, the, cab, and, a, valve, on, the, top, of, the, shaft, to, move, the, cab, upwards, and, closes, the, valve, in, order, to, keep, the, cab, at, the, same, level, a, diaphragm, or, a, piston, is, used, as, a, brake, if, there, is, a, sudden, increase, in, pressure, above, the, cab, to, go, down, it, opens, the, valve, so, that, the, air, can, pressurize, the, top, of, the, shaft, allowing, the, cab, to, go, down, by, its, own, weight, this, also, means, that, in, case, of, a, power, failure, the, cab, will, automatically, go, down, the, shaft, is, made, of, acrylic, and, is, always, round, due, to, the, shape, of, the, vacuum, pump, to, keep, the, air, inside, of, the, cab, rubber, seals, are, used, due, to, technical, limitations, these, elevators, have, a, low, capacity, they, usually, allow, 1, 3, passengers, and, up, to, 525, pounds, 238, kg, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, almost, all, elevators, had, no, automatic, positioning, of, the, floor, on, which, the, cab, would, stop, some, of, the, older, freight, elevators, were, controlled, by, switches, operated, by, pulling, on, adjacent, ropes, in, general, most, elevators, before, wwii, were, manually, controlled, by, elevator, operators, using, a, rheostat, connected, to, the, motor, this, rheostat, see, picture, was, enclosed, within, a, cylindrical, container, about, the, size, and, shape, of, a, cake, this, was, mounted, upright, or, sideways, on, the, cab, wall, and, operated, via, a, projecting, handle, which, was, able, to, slide, around, the, top, half, of, the, cylinder, the, elevator, motor, was, located, at, the, top, of, the, shaft, or, beside, the, bottom, of, the, shaft, pushing, the, handle, forward, would, cause, the, cab, to, rise, backwards, would, make, it, sink, the, harder, the, pressure, the, faster, the, elevator, would, move, the, handle, also, served, as, a, dead, man, switch, if, the, operator, let, go, of, the, handle, it, would, return, to, its, upright, position, causing, the, elevator, cab, to, stop, in, time, safety, interlocks, would, ensure, that, the, inner, and, outer, doors, were, closed, before, the, elevator, was, allowed, to, move, this, lever, would, allow, some, control, over, the, energy, supplied, to, the, motor, and, so, enabled, the, elevator, to, be, accurately, positioned, if, the, operator, was, sufficiently, skilled, more, typically, the, operator, would, have, to, jog, the, control, moving, the, cab, in, small, increments, until, the, elevator, was, reasonably, close, to, the, landing, point, then, the, operator, would, direct, the, outgoing, and, incoming, passengers, to, watch, the, step, the, otis, autotronic, system, of, the, early, 1950s, brought, the, earliest, predictive, systems, which, could, anticipate, traffic, patterns, within, a, building, to, deploy, elevator, movement, in, the, most, efficient, manner, relay, controlled, elevator, systems, remained, common, until, the, 1980s, they, were, gradually, replaced, with, solid, state, systems, and, microprocessor, based, controls, are, now, the, industry, standard, most, older, manually, operated, elevators, have, been, retrofitted, with, automatic, or, semi, automatic, controls, a, typical, modern, passenger, elevator, will, have, the, operation, of, the, door, open, button, is, transparent, immediately, opening, and, holding, the, door, typically, until, a, timeout, occurs, and, the, door, closes, the, operation, of, the, door, close, button, is, less, transparent, and, it, often, appears, to, do, nothing, leading, to, frequent, but, incorrect, reports, that, the, door, close, button, is, a, placebo, button, either, not, wired, up, at, all, or, inactive, in, normal, service, on, many, older, elevators, if, one, is, present, the, door, close, button, is, functional, because, the, elevator, is, not, ada, compliant, and, or, it, does, not, have, a, fire, service, mode, working, door, open, and, door, close, buttons, are, required, by, code, in, many, jurisdictions, including, the, united, states, specifically, for, emergency, operation, in, independent, mode, the, door, open, and, door, close, buttons, are, used, to, manually, open, or, close, the, door, beyond, this, programming, varies, significantly, with, some, door, close, buttons, immediately, closing, the, door, but, in, other, cases, being, delayed, by, an, overall, timeout, so, the, door, cannot, be, closed, until, a, few, seconds, after, opening, in, this, case, hastening, normal, closure, the, door, close, button, has, no, effect, however, the, door, close, button, will, cause, a, hall, call, to, be, ignored, so, the, door, will, not, reopen, and, once, the, timeout, has, expired, the, door, close, will, immediately, close, the, door, for, example, to, cancel, a, door, open, push, the, minimum, timeout, for, automatic, door, closing, in, the, us, is, 5, seconds, which, is, a, noticeable, delay, if, not, over, ridden, some, elevators, may, have, one, or, more, of, the, following, an, audible, signal, button, labeled, s, in, the, us, for, elevators, installed, between, 1991, and, 2012, initial, passage, of, ada, and, coming, into, force, of, 2010, revision, a, button, which, if, pushed, sounds, an, audible, signal, as, each, floor, is, passed, to, assist, visually, impaired, passengers, this, button, is, no, longer, used, on, new, elevators, where, the, sound, is, normally, obligatory, other, controls, which, are, not, available, for, the, public, either, because, they, are, key, switches, or, because, they, are, kept, behind, a, locked, panel, include, elevators, are, typically, controlled, from, the, outside, by, a, call, box, which, has, up, and, down, buttons, at, each, stop, when, pressed, at, a, certain, floor, the, button, also, known, as, a, hall, call, button, calls, the, elevator, to, pick, up, more, passengers, if, the, particular, elevator, is, currently, serving, traffic, in, a, certain, direction, it, will, only, answer, calls, in, the, same, direction, unless, there, are, no, more, calls, beyond, that, floor, in, a, group, of, two, or, more, elevators, the, call, buttons, may, be, linked, to, a, central, dispatch, computer, such, that, they, illuminate, and, cancel, together, this, is, done, to, ensure, that, only, one, car, is, called, at, one, time, key, switches, may, be, installed, on, the, ground, floor, so, that, the, elevator, can, be, remotely, switched, on, or, off, from, the, outside, in, destination, control, systems, one, selects, the, intended, destination, floor, in, lieu, of, pressing, up, or, down, and, is, then, notified, which, elevator, will, serve, their, request, to, distinguish, between, floors, the, different, landings, are, given, numbers, and, sometimes, letters, see, the, above, article, for, more, information, the, elevator, algorithm, a, simple, algorithm, by, which, a, single, elevator, can, decide, where, to, stop, is, summarized, as, follows, the, elevator, algorithm, has, found, an, application, in, computer, operating, systems, as, an, algorithm, for, scheduling, hard, disk, requests, modern, elevators, use, more, complex, heuristic, algorithms, to, decide, which, request, to, service, next, in, taller, buildings, with, high, traffic, such, as, the, new, york, marriott, marquis, or, the, burj, khalifa, the, destination, dispatch, algorithm, is, used, to, group, passengers, going, to, similar, floors, maximizing, load, by, up, to, 25, some, skyscraper, buildings, and, other, types, of, installation, feature, a, destination, operating, panel, where, a, passenger, registers, their, floor, calls, before, entering, the, car, the, system, lets, them, know, which, car, to, wait, for, instead, of, everyone, boarding, the, next, car, in, this, way, travel, time, is, reduced, as, the, elevator, makes, fewer, stops, for, individual, passengers, and, the, computer, distributes, adjacent, stops, to, different, cars, in, the, bank, although, travel, time, is, reduced, passenger, waiting, times, may, be, longer, as, they, will, not, necessarily, be, allocated, the, next, car, to, depart, during, the, down, peak, period, the, benefit, of, destination, control, will, be, limited, as, passengers, have, a, common, destination, it, can, also, improve, accessibility, as, a, mobility, impaired, passenger, can, move, to, their, designated, car, in, advance, inside, the, elevator, there, is, no, call, button, to, push, or, the, buttons, are, there, but, they, cannot, be, pushed, except, door, opening, and, alarm, button, they, only, indicate, stopping, floors, the, idea, of, destination, control, was, originally, conceived, by, leo, port, from, sydney, in, 1961, but, at, that, time, elevator, controllers, were, implemented, in, relays, and, were, unable, to, optimize, the, performance, of, destination, control, allocations, the, system, was, first, pioneered, by, schindler, elevator, in, 1992, as, the, miconic, 10, manufacturers, of, such, systems, claim, that, average, traveling, time, can, be, reduced, by, up, to, 30, however, performance, enhancements, cannot, be, generalized, as, the, benefits, and, limitations, of, the, system, are, dependent, on, many, factors, one, problem, is, that, the, system, is, subject, to, gaming, sometimes, one, person, enters, the, destination, for, a, large, group, of, people, going, to, the, same, floor, the, dispatching, algorithm, is, usually, unable, to, completely, cater, for, the, variation, and, latecomers, may, find, the, elevator, they, are, assigned, to, is, already, full, also, occasionally, one, person, may, press, the, floor, multiple, times, this, is, common, with, up, down, buttons, when, people, believe, this, to, be, an, effective, way, to, hurry, elevators, however, this, will, make, the, computer, think, multiple, people, are, waiting, and, will, allocate, empty, cars, to, serve, this, one, person, to, prevent, this, problem, in, one, implementation, of, destination, control, every, user, is, given, an, rfid, card, for, identification, and, tracking, so, that, the, system, knows, every, user, call, and, can, cancel, the, first, call, if, the, passenger, decides, to, travel, to, another, destination, preventing, empty, calls, the, newest, invention, knows, even, where, people, are, located, and, how, many, on, which, floor, because, of, their, identification, either, for, the, purposes, of, evacuating, the, building, or, for, security, reasons, another, way, to, prevent, this, issue, is, to, treat, everyone, traveling, from, one, floor, to, another, as, one, group, and, to, allocate, only, one, car, for, that, group, the, same, destination, scheduling, concept, can, also, be, applied, to, public, transit, such, as, in, group, rapid, transit, the, anti, crime, protection, acp, feature, will, force, each, car, to, stop, at, a, pre, defined, landing, and, open, its, doors, this, allows, a, security, guard, or, a, receptionist, at, the, landing, to, visually, inspect, the, passengers, the, car, stops, at, this, landing, as, it, passes, to, serve, further, demand, during, up, peak, mode, also, called, moderate, incoming, traffic, elevator, cars, in, a, group, are, recalled, to, the, lobby, to, provide, expeditious, service, to, passengers, arriving, at, the, building, most, typically, in, the, morning, as, people, arrive, for, work, or, at, the, conclusion, of, a, lunch, time, period, when, people, are, going, back, to, work, elevators, are, dispatched, one, by, one, when, they, reach, a, pre, determined, passenger, load, or, when, they, have, had, their, doors, opened, for, a, certain, period, of, time, the, next, elevator, to, be, dispatched, usually, has, its, hall, lantern, or, a, this, car, leaving, next, sign, illuminated, to, encourage, passengers, to, make, maximum, use, of, the, available, elevator, system, capacity, some, elevator, banks, are, programmed, so, that, at, least, one, car, will, always, return, to, the, lobby, floor, and, park, whenever, it, becomes, free, the, commencement, of, up, peak, may, be, triggered, by, a, time, clock, by, the, departure, of, a, certain, number, of, fully, loaded, cars, leaving, the, lobby, within, a, given, time, period, or, by, a, switch, manually, operated, by, a, building, attendant, during, down, peak, mode, elevator, cars, in, a, group, are, sent, away, from, the, lobby, towards, the, highest, floor, served, after, which, they, commence, running, down, the, floors, in, response, to, hall, calls, placed, by, passengers, wishing, to, leave, the, building, this, allows, the, elevator, system, to, provide, maximum, passenger, handling, capacity, for, people, leaving, the, building, the, commencement, of, down, peak, may, be, triggered, by, a, time, clock, by, the, arrival, of, a, certain, number, of, fully, loaded, cars, at, the, lobby, within, a, given, time, period, or, by, a, switch, manually, operated, by, a, building, attendant, in, areas, with, large, populations, of, observant, jews, or, in, facilities, catering, to, jews, one, may, find, a, sabbath, elevator, in, this, mode, an, elevator, will, stop, automatically, at, every, floor, allowing, people, to, step, on, and, off, without, having, to, push, any, buttons, this, prevents, violation, of, the, sabbath, prohibition, against, operating, electrical, devices, when, sabbath, is, in, effect, for, those, who, observe, this, ritual, however, sabbath, mode, has, the, side, effect, of, using, considerable, amounts, of, energy, running, the, elevator, car, sequentially, up, and, down, every, floor, of, a, building, repeatedly, servicing, floors, where, it, is, not, needed, for, a, tall, building, with, many, floors, the, car, must, move, on, a, frequent, enough, basis, so, as, to, not, cause, undue, delay, for, potential, users, that, will, not, touch, the, controls, as, it, opens, the, doors, on, every, floor, up, the, building, independent, service, or, car, preference, is, a, special, mode, found, on, most, elevators, it, is, activated, by, a, key, switch, either, inside, the, elevator, itself, or, on, a, centralized, control, panel, in, the, lobby, when, an, elevator, is, placed, on, this, mode, it, will, no, longer, respond, to, hall, calls, in, a, bank, of, elevators, traffic, is, rerouted, to, the, other, elevators, while, in, a, single, elevator, the, hall, buttons, are, disabled, the, elevator, will, remain, parked, on, a, floor, with, its, doors, open, until, a, floor, is, selected, and, the, door, close, button, is, held, until, the, elevator, starts, to, travel, independent, service, is, useful, when, transporting, large, goods, or, moving, groups, of, people, between, certain, floors, inspection, service, is, designed, to, provide, access, to, the, hoistway, and, car, top, for, inspection, and, maintenance, purposes, by, qualified, elevator, mechanics, it, is, first, activated, by, a, key, switch, on, the, car, operating, panel, usually, labeled, inspection, car, top, access, enable, or, hwenab, short, for, hoistway, access, enabled, when, this, switch, is, activated, the, elevator, will, come, to, a, stop, if, moving, car, calls, will, be, canceled, and, the, buttons, disabled, and, hall, calls, will, be, assigned, to, other, elevator, cars, in, the, group, or, canceled, in, a, single, elevator, configuration, the, elevator, can, now, only, be, moved, by, the, corresponding, access, key, switches, usually, located, at, the, highest, to, access, the, top, of, the, car, and, lowest, to, access, the, elevator, pit, landings, the, access, key, switches, will, allow, the, car, to, move, at, reduced, inspection, speed, with, the, hoistway, door, open, this, speed, can, range, from, anywhere, up, to, 60, of, normal, operating, speed, on, most, controllers, and, is, usually, defined, by, local, safety, codes, elevators, have, a, car, top, inspection, station, that, allows, the, car, to, be, operated, by, a, mechanic, in, order, to, move, it, through, the, hoistway, generally, there, are, three, buttons, up, run, and, down, both, the, run, and, a, direction, button, must, be, held, to, move, the, car, in, that, direction, and, the, elevator, will, stop, moving, as, soon, as, the, buttons, are, released, most, other, elevators, have, an, up, down, toggle, switch, and, a, run, button, the, inspection, panel, also, has, standard, power, outlets, for, work, lamps, and, powered, tools, depending, on, the, location, of, the, elevator, fire, service, code, will, vary, state, to, state, and, country, to, country, fire, service, is, usually, split, up, into, two, modes, phase, one, and, phase, two, these, are, separate, modes, that, the, elevator, can, go, into, phase, one, mode, is, activated, by, a, corresponding, smoke, sensor, heat, sensor, or, manual, key, switch, in, the, building, once, an, alarm, has, been, activated, the, elevator, will, automatically, go, into, phase, one, the, elevator, will, wait, an, amount, of, time, then, proceed, to, go, into, nudging, mode, to, tell, everyone, the, elevator, is, leaving, the, floor, once, the, elevator, has, left, the, floor, depending, on, where, the, alarm, was, set, off, the, elevator, will, go, to, the, fire, recall, floor, however, if, the, alarm, was, activated, on, the, fire, recall, floor, the, elevator, will, have, an, alternate, floor, to, recall, to, when, the, elevator, is, recalled, it, proceeds, to, the, recall, floor, and, stops, with, its, doors, open, the, elevator, will, no, longer, respond, to, calls, or, move, in, any, direction, located, on, the, fire, recall, floor, is, a, fire, service, key, switch, the, fire, service, key, switch, has, the, ability, to, turn, fire, service, off, turn, fire, service, on, or, bypass, fire, service, the, only, way, to, return, the, elevator, to, normal, service, is, to, switch, it, to, bypass, after, the, alarms, have, reset, phase, two, mode, can, only, be, activated, by, a, key, switch, located, inside, the, elevator, on, the, car, operating, panel, this, mode, was, created, for, firefighters, so, that, they, may, rescue, people, from, a, burning, building, the, phase, two, key, switch, has, three, positions, off, on, and, hold, by, turning, phase, two, on, the, firefighter, enables, the, car, to, move, however, like, independent, service, mode, the, car, will, not, respond, to, a, car, call, unless, the, firefighter, manually, pushes, and, holds, the, door, close, button, once, the, elevator, gets, to, the, desired, floor, it, will, not, open, its, doors, unless, the, firefighter, holds, the, door, open, button, this, is, in, case, the, floor, is, burning, and, the, firefighter, can, feel, the, heat, and, knows, not, to, open, the, door, the, firefighter, must, hold, the, door, open, button, until, the, door, is, completely, opened, if, for, any, reason, the, firefighter, wishes, to, leave, the, elevator, they, will, use, the, hold, position, on, the, key, switch, to, make, sure, the, elevator, remains, at, that, floor, if, the, firefighter, wishes, to, return, to, the, recall, floor, they, simply, turn, the, key, off, and, close, the, doors, in, the, uk, and, europe, the, requirements, for, firefighters, lifts, are, defined, in, the, standard, en81, 72, commonly, found, in, hospitals, code, blue, service, allows, an, elevator, to, be, summoned, to, any, floor, for, use, in, an, emergency, situation, each, floor, will, have, a, code, blue, recall, key, switch, and, when, activated, the, elevator, system, will, immediately, select, the, elevator, car, that, can, respond, the, fastest, regardless, of, direction, of, travel, and, passenger, load, passengers, inside, the, elevator, will, be, notified, with, an, alarm, and, indicator, light, to, exit, the, elevator, when, the, doors, open, once, the, elevator, arrives, at, the, floor, it, will, park, with, its, doors, open, and, the, car, buttons, will, be, disabled, to, prevent, a, passenger, from, taking, control, of, the, elevator, medical, personnel, must, then, activate, the, code, blue, key, switch, inside, the, car, select, their, floor, and, close, the, doors, with, the, door, close, button, the, elevator, will, then, travel, non, stop, to, the, selected, floor, and, will, remain, in, code, blue, service, until, switched, off, in, the, car, some, hospital, elevators, will, feature, a, hold, position, on, the, code, blue, key, switch, similar, to, fire, service, which, allows, the, elevator, to, remain, at, a, floor, locked, out, of, service, until, code, blue, is, deactivated, in, the, event, of, civil, disturbance, insurrection, or, rioting, management, can, prevent, elevators, from, stopping, at, the, lobby, or, parking, areas, preventing, undesired, persons, from, using, the, elevators, while, still, allowing, the, building, tenants, to, use, them, within, the, rest, of, the, building, many, elevator, installations, now, feature, emergency, power, systems, such, as, uninterruptible, power, supply, ups, which, allow, elevator, use, in, blackout, situations, and, prevent, people, from, becoming, trapped, in, elevators, to, be, compliant, with, bs, 9999, safety, standards, a, passenger, lift, being, used, in, an, emergency, situation, must, have, a, secondary, source, of, power, where, a, generator, is, being, used, as, the, secondary, power, supply, in, a, hospital, a, ups, must, also, be, present, to, meet, regulations, stating, that, healthcare, facilities, must, test, their, emergency, generators, under, load, at, least, once, per, month, during, the, test, period, only, one, supply, of, power, is, feeding, the, lift, in, a, blackout, situation, without, a, ups, the, lifts, would, not, be, operational, when, power, is, lost, in, a, traction, elevator, system, all, elevators, will, initially, come, to, a, halt, one, by, one, each, car, in, the, group, will, return, to, the, lobby, floor, open, its, doors, and, shut, down, people, in, the, remaining, elevators, may, see, an, indicator, light, or, hear, a, voice, announcement, informing, them, that, the, elevator, will, return, to, the, lobby, shortly, once, all, cars, have, successfully, returned, the, system, will, then, automatically, select, one, or, more, cars, to, be, used, for, normal, operations, and, these, cars, will, return, to, service, the, car, s, selected, to, run, under, emergency, power, can, be, manually, over, ridden, by, a, key, or, strip, switch, in, the, lobby, to, help, prevent, entrapment, when, the, system, detects, that, it, is, running, low, on, power, it, will, bring, the, running, cars, to, the, lobby, or, nearest, floor, open, the, doors, and, shut, down, in, hydraulic, elevator, systems, emergency, power, will, lower, the, elevators, to, the, lowest, landing, and, open, the, doors, to, allow, passengers, to, exit, the, doors, then, close, after, an, adjustable, time, period, and, the, car, remains, unusable, until, reset, usually, by, cycling, the, elevator, main, power, switch, typically, due, to, the, high, current, draw, when, starting, the, pump, motor, hydraulic, elevators, are, not, run, using, standard, emergency, power, systems, buildings, like, hospitals, and, nursing, homes, usually, size, their, emergency, generators, to, accommodate, this, draw, however, the, increasing, use, of, current, limiting, motor, starters, commonly, known, as, soft, start, contactors, avoids, much, of, this, problem, and, the, current, draw, of, the, pump, motor, is, less, of, a, limiting, concern, most, elevators, are, built, to, provide, about, 30, to, 40, years, of, service, as, long, as, service, intervals, specified, and, periodic, maintenance, inspections, by, the, manufacturer, are, followed, as, the, elevator, ages, and, equipment, become, increasingly, difficult, to, find, or, replace, along, with, code, changes, and, deteriorating, ride, performance, a, complete, overhaul, of, the, elevator, may, be, suggested, to, the, building, owners, a, typical, modernization, consists, of, controller, equipment, electrical, wiring, and, buttons, position, indicators, and, direction, arrows, hoist, machines, and, motors, including, door, operators, and, sometimes, door, hanger, tracks, rarely, are, car, slings, rails, or, other, heavy, structures, changed, the, cost, of, an, elevator, modernization, can, range, greatly, depending, on, which, type, of, equipment, is, to, be, installed, modernization, can, greatly, improve, operational, reliability, by, replacing, electrical, relays, and, contacts, with, solid, state, electronics, ride, quality, can, be, improved, by, replacing, motor, generator, based, drive, designs, with, variable, voltage, variable, frequency, v3f, drives, providing, near, seamless, acceleration, and, deceleration, passenger, safety, is, also, improved, by, updating, systems, and, equipment, to, conform, to, current, codes, on, 26, february, 2014, the, european, union, released, their, adoption, of, safety, standards, through, a, directive, notification, statistically, speaking, traction, elevators, are, extremely, safe, of, the, 20, to, 30, elevator, related, deaths, each, year, most, of, them, are, maintenance, related, for, example, technicians, leaning, too, far, into, the, shaft, or, getting, caught, between, moving, parts, and, most, of, the, rest, are, attributed, to, other, kinds, of, accidents, such, as, people, stepping, blindly, through, doors, that, open, into, empty, shafts, or, being, strangled, by, scarves, caught, in, the, doors, while, it, is, possible, though, extraordinarily, unlikely, for, an, elevator, s, cable, to, snap, all, elevators, in, the, modern, era, have, been, fitted, with, several, safety, devices, which, prevent, the, elevator, from, simply, free, falling, and, crashing, an, elevator, cab, is, typically, borne, by, 2, to, 6, up, to, 12, or, more, in, high, rise, installations, redundant, hoist, cables, or, belts, each, of, which, is, capable, on, its, own, of, supporting, the, rated, load, of, the, elevator, plus, twenty, five, percent, more, weight, in, addition, there, is, a, device, which, detects, whether, the, elevator, is, descending, faster, than, its, maximum, designed, speed, if, this, happens, the, device, causes, copper, or, silicon, nitride, ceramic, in, high, rise, installations, brake, shoes, to, clamp, down, along, the, vertical, rails, in, the, shaft, stopping, the, elevator, quickly, but, not, so, abruptly, as, to, cause, injury, this, device, called, the, governor, was, invented, by, elisha, graves, otis, for, example, in, 2007, an, elevator, at, a, seattle, children, s, hospital, experienced, cable, failure, causing, it, to, free, fall, until, its, governor, engaged, in, addition, an, oil, hydraulic, or, spring, or, polyurethane, or, telescopic, oil, hydraulic, buffer, or, a, combination, depending, on, the, travel, height, and, travel, speed, is, installed, at, the, bottom, of, the, shaft, or, in, the, bottom, of, the, cab, and, sometimes, also, in, the, top, of, the, cab, or, shaft, to, somewhat, cushion, any, impact, lethal, accidents, do, occur, however, in, 1989, seven, people, were, killed, at, a, hospital, in, l, hospitalet, spain, when, the, pulleys, connecting, the, cables, to, the, elevator, cabin, broke, loose, and, the, safety, mechanism, failed, to, activate, causing, the, elevator, to, plunge, seven, stories, to, the, ground, a, similar, accident, occurred, in, 2019, in, santos, brazil, killing, four, past, problems, with, hydraulic, elevators, include, underground, electrolytic, destruction, of, the, cylinder, and, bulkhead, pipe, failures, and, control, failures, single, bulkhead, cylinders, typically, built, prior, to, a, 1972, asme, a17, 1, elevator, safety, code, change, requiring, a, second, dished, bulkhead, were, subject, to, possible, catastrophic, failure, the, code, previously, permitted, only, single, bottom, hydraulic, cylinders, in, the, event, of, a, cylinder, breach, the, fluid, loss, results, in, uncontrolled, down, movement, of, the, elevator, this, creates, two, significant, hazards, being, subject, to, an, impact, at, the, bottom, when, the, elevator, stops, suddenly, and, being, in, the, entrance, for, a, potential, shear, if, the, rider, is, partly, in, the, elevator, because, it, is, impossible, to, verify, the, system, at, all, times, the, code, requires, periodic, testing, of, the, pressure, capability, another, solution, to, protect, against, a, cylinder, blowout, is, to, install, a, plunger, gripping, device, two, commercially, available, are, known, by, the, marketing, names, lifejacket, and, hydrobrake, the, plunger, gripper, is, a, device, which, in, the, event, of, an, uncontrolled, downward, acceleration, nondestructively, grips, the, plunger, and, stops, the, car, a, device, known, as, an, overspeed, or, rupture, valve, is, attached, to, the, hydraulic, inlet, outlet, of, the, cylinder, and, is, adjusted, for, a, maximum, flow, rate, if, a, pipe, or, hose, were, to, break, rupture, the, flow, rate, of, the, rupture, valve, will, surpass, a, set, limit, and, mechanically, stop, the, outlet, flow, of, hydraulic, fluid, thus, stopping, the, plunger, and, the, car, in, the, down, direction, in, addition, to, the, safety, concerns, for, older, hydraulic, elevators, there, is, risk, of, leaking, hydraulic, oil, into, the, aquifer, and, causing, potential, environmental, contamination, this, has, led, to, the, introduction, of, pvc, liners, casings, around, hydraulic, cylinders, which, can, be, monitored, for, integrity, in, the, past, decade, recent, innovations, in, inverted, hydraulic, jacks, have, eliminated, the, costly, process, of, drilling, the, ground, to, install, a, borehole, jack, this, also, eliminates, the, threat, of, corrosion, to, the, system, and, increases, safety, safety, testing, of, mine, shaft, elevator, rails, is, routinely, undertaken, the, method, involves, destructive, testing, of, a, segment, of, the, cable, the, ends, of, the, segment, are, frayed, then, set, in, conical, zinc, molds, each, end, of, the, segment, is, then, secured, in, a, large, hydraulic, stretching, machine, the, segment, is, then, placed, under, increasing, load, to, the, point, of, failure, data, about, elasticity, load, and, other, factors, is, compiled, and, a, report, is, produced, the, report, is, then, analyzed, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, entire, rail, is, safe, to, use, a, passenger, elevator, is, designed, to, move, people, between, a, building, s, floors, passenger, elevators, capacity, is, related, to, the, available, floor, space, generally, passenger, elevators, in, buildings, of, eight, floors, or, fewer, are, hydraulic, or, electric, which, can, reach, speeds, up, to, 1, m, s, 200, ft, min, hydraulic, and, up, to, 3, m, s, 500, ft, min, electric, sometimes, passenger, elevators, are, used, as, a, city, transport, along, with, funiculars, for, example, there, is, a, three, station, underground, public, elevator, in, yalta, ukraine, which, takes, passengers, from, the, top, of, a, hill, above, the, black, sea, on, which, hotels, are, perched, to, a, tunnel, located, on, the, beach, below, at, casco, viejo, station, in, the, bilbao, metro, the, elevator, that, provides, access, to, the, station, from, a, hilltop, neighborhood, doubles, as, city, transportation, the, station, s, ticket, barriers, are, set, up, in, such, a, way, that, passengers, can, pay, to, reach, the, elevator, from, the, entrance, in, the, lower, city, or, vice, versa, see, also, the, elevators, for, urban, transport, section, passenger, elevators, may, be, specialized, for, the, service, they, perform, including, hospital, emergency, code, blue, front, and, rear, entrances, a, television, in, high, rise, buildings, double, decker, and, other, uses, cars, may, be, ornate, in, their, interior, appearance, may, have, audio, visual, advertising, and, may, be, provided, with, specialized, recorded, voice, announcements, elevators, may, also, have, loudspeakers, in, them, to, play, calm, easy, listening, music, such, music, is, often, referred, to, as, elevator, music, an, express, elevator, does, not, serve, all, floors, for, example, it, moves, between, the, ground, floor, and, a, skylobby, or, it, moves, from, the, ground, floor, or, a, skylobby, to, a, range, of, floors, skipping, floors, in, between, these, are, especially, popular, in, eastern, asia, residential, elevators, may, be, small, enough, to, only, accommodate, one, person, while, some, are, large, enough, for, more, than, a, dozen, wheelchair, or, platform, elevators, a, specialized, type, of, elevator, designed, to, move, a, wheelchair, 3, 7, m, 12, ft, or, less, can, often, accommodate, just, one, person, in, a, wheelchair, at, a, time, with, a, load, of, 340, kg, 750, lb, a, freight, elevator, or, goods, lift, is, an, elevator, designed, to, carry, goods, rather, than, passengers, freight, elevators, are, generally, required, to, display, a, written, notice, in, the, car, that, the, use, by, passengers, is, prohibited, though, not, necessarily, illegal, though, certain, freight, elevators, allow, dual, use, through, the, use, of, an, inconspicuous, riser, in, order, for, an, elevator, to, be, legal, to, carry, passengers, in, some, jurisdictions, it, must, have, a, solid, inner, door, freight, elevators, are, typically, larger, and, capable, of, carrying, heavier, loads, than, a, passenger, elevator, generally, from, 2, 300, to, 4, 500, kg, 5, 100, to, 9, 900, lb, freight, elevators, may, have, manually, operated, doors, and, often, have, rugged, interior, finishes, to, prevent, damage, while, loading, and, unloading, a, sidewalk, elevator, is, a, special, type, of, freight, elevator, sidewalk, elevators, are, used, to, move, materials, between, a, basement, and, a, ground, level, area, often, the, sidewalk, just, outside, the, building, they, are, controlled, via, an, exterior, switch, and, emerge, from, a, metal, trap, door, at, ground, level, sidewalk, elevator, cars, feature, a, uniquely, shaped, top, that, allows, this, door, to, open, and, close, automatically, stage, lifts, and, orchestra, lifts, are, specialized, elevators, typically, powered, by, hydraulics, that, are, used, to, raise, and, lower, entire, sections, of, a, theater, stage, for, example, radio, city, music, hall, has, four, such, elevators, an, orchestra, lift, that, covers, a, large, area, of, the, stage, and, three, smaller, lifts, near, the, rear, of, the, stage, in, this, case, the, orchestra, lift, is, powerful, enough, to, raise, an, entire, orchestra, or, an, entire, cast, of, performers, including, live, elephants, up, to, stage, level, from, below, there, is, a, barrel, on, the, background, of, the, image, of, the, left, which, can, be, used, as, a, scale, to, represent, the, size, of, the, mechanism, vehicular, elevators, are, used, within, buildings, or, areas, with, limited, space, in, place, of, ramps, generally, to, move, cars, into, the, parking, garage, or, manufacturer, s, storage, geared, hydraulic, chains, not, unlike, bicycle, chains, generate, lift, for, the, platform, and, there, are, no, counterweights, to, accommodate, building, designs, and, improve, accessibility, the, platform, may, rotate, so, that, the, driver, only, has, to, drive, forward, most, vehicle, elevators, have, a, weight, capacity, of, 2, tons, rare, examples, of, extra, heavy, elevators, for, 20, ton, lorries, and, even, for, railcars, like, one, that, was, used, at, dnipro, station, of, the, kyiv, metro, also, occur, in, some, smaller, canals, boats, and, small, ships, can, pass, between, different, levels, of, a, canal, with, a, boat, elevator, rather, than, through, a, canal, lock, on, aircraft, carriers, elevators, carry, aircraft, between, the, flight, deck, and, the, hangar, deck, for, operations, or, repairs, these, elevators, are, designed, for, much, greater, capacity, than, other, elevators, up, to, 91, 000, kg, 200, 000, lb, of, aircraft, and,

special, purpose, passenger, elevator, used, infrequently, and, which, is, exempt, from, many, commercial, regulations, and, accommodations, for, example, a, lu, la, is, primarily, meant, to, be, handicapped, accessible, and, there, might, only, be, room, for, a, single, wheelchair, and, a, standing, passenger, a, residential, elevator, or, home, lift, is, often, permitted, to, be, of, lower, cost, and, complexity, than, full, commercial, elevators, they, may, have, unique, design, characteristics, suited, for, home, furnishings, such, as, hinged, wooden, shaft, access, doors, rather, than, the, typical, metal, sliding, doors, of, commercial, elevators, construction, may, be, less, robust, than, in, commercial, designs, with, shorter, maintenance, periods, but, safety, systems, such, as, locks, on, shaft, access, doors, fall, arrestors, and, emergency, phones, must, still, be, present, in, the, event, of, malfunction, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, asme, has, a, specific, section, of, safety, code, asme, a17, 1, section, 5, 3, which, addresses, residential, elevators, this, section, allows, for, different, parameters, to, alleviate, design, complexity, based, on, the, limited, use, of, a, residential, elevator, by, a, specific, user, or, user, group, section, 5, 3, of, the, asme, a17, 1, safety, code, is, for, private, residence, elevators, which, does, not, include, multi, family, dwellings, some, types, of, residential, elevators, do, not, use, a, traditional, elevator, shaft, machine, room, and, elevator, hoistway, this, allows, an, elevator, to, be, installed, where, a, traditional, elevator, may, not, fit, and, simplifies, installation, the, asme, board, first, approved, machine, room, less, systems, in, a, revision, of, the, asme, a17, 1, in, 2007, machine, room, less, elevators, have, been, available, commercially, since, the, mid, 1990s, however, cost, and, overall, size, prevented, their, adoption, to, the, residential, elevator, market, until, around, 2010, also, residential, elevators, are, smaller, than, commercial, elevators, the, smallest, passenger, elevator, is, pneumatic, and, it, allows, for, only, 1, person, the, smallest, traction, elevator, allows, for, just, 2, persons, dumbwaiters, are, small, freight, elevators, that, are, intended, to, carry, food, books, or, other, small, freight, loads, rather, than, passengers, they, often, connect, kitchens, to, rooms, on, other, floors, they, usually, do, not, have, the, same, safety, features, found, in, passenger, elevators, like, various, ropes, for, redundancy, they, have, a, lower, capacity, and, they, can, be, up, to, 1, metre, 3, ft, tall, control, panels, at, every, stop, mimic, those, found, in, passenger, elevators, allowing, calling, door, control, and, floor, selection, a, special, type, of, elevator, is, the, paternoster, a, constantly, moving, chain, of, boxes, a, similar, concept, called, the, manlift, or, humanlift, moves, only, a, small, platform, which, the, rider, mounts, while, using, a, handhold, seen, in, multi, story, industrial, plants, the, scissor, lift, is, yet, another, type, of, elevator, these, are, usually, mobile, work, platforms, that, can, be, easily, moved, to, where, they, are, needed, but, can, also, be, installed, where, space, for, counter, weights, machine, room, and, so, forth, is, limited, the, mechanism, that, makes, them, go, up, and, down, is, like, that, of, a, scissor, jack, rack, and, pinion, elevator, are, powered, by, a, motor, driving, a, pinion, gear, because, they, can, be, installed, on, a, building, or, structure, s, exterior, and, there, is, no, machine, room, or, hoistway, required, they, are, the, most, used, type, of, elevator, for, buildings, under, construction, to, move, materials, and, tools, up, and, down, material, transport, elevators, generally, consist, of, an, inclined, plane, on, which, a, conveyor, belt, runs, the, conveyor, often, includes, partitions, to, ensure, that, the, material, moves, forward, these, elevators, are, often, used, in, industrial, and, agricultural, applications, when, such, mechanisms, or, spiral, screws, or, pneumatic, transport, are, used, to, elevate, grain, for, storage, in, large, vertical, silos, the, entire, structure, is, called, a, grain, elevator, belt, elevators, are, often, used, in, docks, for, loading, loose, materials, such, as, coal, iron, ore, and, grain, into, the, holds, of, bulk, carriers, there, have, occasionally, been, belt, lifts, for, humans, these, typically, have, steps, about, every, 2, m, 6, ft, 6, 7, in, along, the, length, of, the, belt, which, moves, vertically, so, that, the, passenger, can, stand, on, one, step, and, hold, on, to, the, one, above, these, belts, are, sometimes, used, for, example, to, carry, the, employees, of, parking, garages, but, are, considered, too, dangerous, for, public, use, before, the, widespread, use, of, elevators, most, residential, buildings, were, limited, to, about, seven, stories, the, wealthy, lived, on, lower, floors, while, poorer, residents, required, to, climb, many, flights, of, stairs, lived, on, higher, floors, the, elevator, reversed, this, social, stratification, exemplified, by, the, modern, penthouse, suite, early, users, of, elevators, sometimes, reported, nausea, caused, by, abrupt, stops, while, descending, and, some, users, would, use, stairs, to, go, down, in, 1894, a, chicago, physician, documented, elevator, sickness, elevators, necessitated, new, social, protocols, when, nicholas, ii, of, russia, visited, the, hotel, adlon, in, berlin, his, courtiers, panicked, about, who, would, enter, the, elevator, first, and, who, would, press, the, buttons, in, lifted, a, cultural, history, of, the, elevator, author, andreas, bernard, documents, other, social, impacts, caused, by, the, modern, elevator, including, thriller, movies, about, stuck, elevators, casual, encounters, and, sexual, tension, on, elevators, the, reduction, of, personal, space, and, claustrophobia, and, concerns, about, personal, hygiene, elevators, may, feature, talking, devices, as, an, accessibility, aid, for, the, blind, since, the, early, 1980s, some, elevators, feature, voice, synthesis, to, announce, floor, landings, car, direction, and, special, messages, to, passengers, otis, is, well, known, for, this, in, some, of, their, gen2, model, elevators, in, addition, to, the, call, buttons, elevators, usually, have, floor, indicators, often, illuminated, by, led, and, direction, lanterns, the, former, are, almost, universal, in, cab, interiors, with, more, than, two, stops, and, may, be, found, outside, the, elevators, as, well, on, one, or, more, of, the, floors, floor, indicators, can, consist, of, a, dial, with, a, rotating, needle, but, the, most, common, types, are, those, with, successively, illuminated, floor, indications, or, lcds, likewise, a, change, of, floors, or, an, arrival, at, a, floor, is, indicated, by, a, sound, depending, on, the, elevator, some, buildings, use, proximity, technology, that, recognizes, residents, and, brings, the, elevator, to, ground, level, direction, lanterns, are, also, found, both, inside, and, outside, elevator, cars, but, they, should, always, be, visible, from, outside, because, their, primary, purpose, is, to, help, people, decide, whether, or, not, to, get, on, the, elevator, if, somebody, waiting, for, the, elevator, wants, to, go, up, but, a, car, comes, first, that, indicates, that, it, is, going, down, then, the, person, may, decide, not, to, get, on, the, elevator, if, the, person, waits, then, one, will, still, stop, going, up, direction, indicators, are, sometimes, etched, with, arrows, or, shaped, like, arrows, and, or, use, the, convention, that, one, that, lights, up, red, means, down, and, green, or, white, means, up, since, the, color, convention, is, often, undermined, or, over, ridden, by, systems, that, do, not, invoke, it, it, is, usually, used, only, in, conjunction, with, other, differentiating, factors, an, example, of, a, place, whose, elevators, use, only, the, color, convention, to, differentiate, between, directions, is, the, museum, of, contemporary, art, in, chicago, where, a, single, circle, can, be, made, to, light, up, green, for, up, and, red, for, down, sometimes, directions, must, be, inferred, by, the, position, of, the, indicators, relative, to, one, another, in, addition, to, lanterns, most, elevators, have, a, chime, to, indicate, if, the, elevator, is, going, up, or, down, either, before, or, after, the, doors, open, usually, in, conjunction, with, the, lanterns, lighting, up, for, example, one, chime, can, indicate, up, two, down, and, no, chimes, indicate, an, elevator, that, is, free, observatory, service, elevators, often, convey, other, facts, of, interest, including, elevator, speed, stopwatch, and, current, position, altitude, as, with, the, case, for, taipei, 101, s, service, elevators, there, are, several, technologies, aimed, to, provide, better, experience, to, passengers, suffering, from, claustrophobia, anthropophobia, or, social, anxiety, israeli, startup, digigage, uses, motion, sensors, to, scroll, the, pre, rendered, images, building, and, floor, specific, content, on, a, screen, embedded, into, the, wall, as, the, cab, moves, up, and, down, british, company, lifteye, provides, a, virtual, window, technology, to, turn, common, elevator, into, panoramic, it, creates, 3d, video, panorama, using, live, feed, from, cameras, placed, vertically, along, the, facade, and, synchronizes, it, with, cab, movement, the, video, is, projected, on, a, wall, sized, screens, making, it, look, like, the, walls, are, made, of, glass, the, primary, reason, for, installing, an, elevator, air, conditioner, is, the, comfort, that, it, provides, while, traveling, in, the, elevator, it, stabilizes, the, condition, of, the, air, inside, the, elevator, car, some, elevator, air, conditioners, can, be, used, in, countries, with, cold, climates, if, a, thermostat, is, used, to, reverse, the, refrigeration, cycle, to, warm, the, elevator, car, heat, generated, from, the, cooling, process, is, dissipated, into, the, hoistway, the, elevator, cab, or, car, is, ordinarily, not, air, tight, and, some, of, this, heat, may, reenter, the, car, and, reduce, the, overall, cooling, effect, the, air, from, the, lobby, constantly, leaks, into, the, elevator, shaft, due, to, elevator, movements, as, well, as, elevator, shaft, ventilation, requirements, using, this, conditioned, air, in, the, elevator, does, not, increase, energy, costs, however, by, using, an, independent, elevator, air, conditioner, to, achieve, better, temperature, control, inside, the, car, more, energy, will, be, used, air, conditioning, poses, a, problem, to, elevators, because, of, the, condensation, that, occurs, the, condensed, water, produced, has, to, be, disposed, of, otherwise, it, would, create, flooding, in, the, elevator, car, and, hoistway, there, are, at, least, four, ways, to, remove, condensed, water, from, the, air, conditioner, however, each, solution, has, its, pros, and, cons, atomizing, also, known, as, misting, the, condensed, water, is, one, way, to, dispose, of, the, condensed, water, spraying, ultra, fine, water, droplets, onto, the, hot, coils, of, the, air, conditioner, ensures, that, the, condensed, water, evaporates, quickly, though, this, is, one, of, the, best, methods, to, dispose, of, the, condensed, water, it, is, also, one, of, the, costliest, because, the, nozzle, that, atomizes, the, water, easily, gets, choked, the, majority, of, the, cost, goes, to, maintaining, the, entire, atomizing, system, disposing, of, condensed, water, works, by, firstly, collecting, the, condensed, water, and, then, heating, it, to, above, boiling, point, the, condensed, water, is, eventually, evaporated, thereby, disposing, of, it, consumers, are, reluctant, to, employ, this, system, because, of, the, high, rate, of, energy, used, just, to, dispose, of, this, water, the, cascading, method, works, by, flowing, the, condensed, water, directly, onto, the, hot, coils, of, the, air, conditioner, this, eventually, evaporates, the, condensed, water, the, downside, of, this, technology, is, that, the, coils, have, to, be, at, extremely, high, temperature, for, the, condensed, water, to, be, evaporated, there, is, a, chance, that, the, water, might, not, evaporate, entirely, and, that, would, cause, water, to, overflow, onto, the, exterior, of, the, car, drainage, system, works, by, creating, a, sump, to, collect, the, condensed, water, and, using, a, pump, to, dispose, of, it, through, a, drainage, system, it, is, an, efficient, method, but, it, comes, at, a, heavy, price, because, of, the, cost, of, building, the, sump, moreover, maintaining, the, pump, to, make, sure, it, operates, is, very, expensive, furthermore, the, pipes, used, for, drainage, would, look, ugly, on, the, exterior, this, system, also, cannot, be, implemented, on, a, built, project, the, mechanical, and, electrical, design, of, elevators, is, dictated, according, to, various, standards, aka, elevator, codes, which, may, be, international, national, state, regional, or, city, based, whereas, once, many, standards, were, prescriptive, specifying, exact, criteria, which, must, be, complied, with, there, has, recently, been, a, shift, towards, more, performance, based, standards, where, the, onus, falls, on, the, designer, to, ensure, that, the, elevator, meets, or, exceeds, the, standard, national, elevator, standards, converged, in, iso, 22559, series, safety, requirements, for, lifts, elevators, iso, tc, 178, is, the, technical, committee, on, lifts, escalators, and, moving, walks, because, an, elevator, is, part, of, a, building, it, must, also, comply, with, building, code, standards, relating, to, earthquake, resilience, fire, standards, electrical, wiring, rules, and, so, forth, the, american, national, elevator, standards, group, anesg, sets, an, elevator, weight, standard, to, be, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, additional, requirements, relating, to, access, by, disabled, persons, may, be, mandated, by, laws, or, regulations, such, as, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, elevators, marked, with, a, star, of, life, are, big, enough, for, a, stretcher, in, most, us, and, canadian, jurisdictions, passenger, elevators, are, required, to, conform, to, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, standard, a17, 1, safety, code, for, elevators, and, escalators, as, of, 2006, all, states, except, kansas, mississippi, north, dakota, and, south, dakota, have, adopted, some, version, of, asme, codes, though, not, necessarily, the, most, recent, in, canada, the, document, is, the, can, csa, b44, safety, standard, which, was, harmonized, with, the, us, version, in, the, 2000, edition, in, addition, passenger, elevators, may, be, required, to, conform, to, the, requirements, of, a17, 3, for, existing, elevators, where, referenced, by, the, local, jurisdiction, passenger, elevators, are, tested, using, the, asme, a17, 2, standard, the, frequency, of, these, tests, is, mandated, by, the, local, jurisdiction, which, may, be, a, town, city, state, or, provincial, standard, passenger, elevators, must, also, conform, to, many, ancillary, building, codes, including, the, local, or, state, building, code, national, fire, protection, association, standards, for, electrical, fire, sprinklers, and, fire, alarms, plumbing, codes, and, hvac, codes, also, passenger, elevators, are, required, to, conform, to, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, and, other, state, and, federal, civil, rights, legislation, regarding, accessibility, residential, elevators, are, required, to, conform, to, asme, a17, 1, platform, and, wheelchair, elevators, are, required, to, comply, with, asme, a18, 1, in, most, us, jurisdictions, most, elevators, have, a, location, in, which, the, permit, for, the, building, owner, to, operate, the, elevator, is, displayed, while, some, jurisdictions, require, the, permit, to, be, displayed, in, the, elevator, cab, other, jurisdictions, allow, for, the, operating, permit, to, be, kept, on, file, elsewhere, such, as, the, maintenance, office, and, to, be, made, available, for, inspection, on, demand, in, such, cases, instead, of, the, permit, being, displayed, in, the, elevator, cab, often, a, notice, is, posted, in, its, place, informing, riders, of, where, the, actual, permits, are, kept, 700, 000, as, of, june, 2019, as, of, january, 2008, spain, is, the, nation, with, the, most, elevators, installed, per, capita, in, the, world, with, 950, 000, elevators, installed, that, run, more, than, one, hundred, million, lifts, every, day, followed, by, united, states, with, 700, 000, elevators, installed, and, china, with, 610, 000, elevators, installed, since, 1949, in, brazil, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, approximately, 300,

as, of, june, 2019, korean, annual, elevator, maintenance, market, is, around, us, 1, billion, the, eiffel, tower, has, otis, double, deck, elevators, built, into, the, legs, of, the, tower, serving, the, ground, level, to, the, first, and, second, levels, even, though, the, shaft, runs, diagonally, upwards, with, the, contour, of, the, tower, both, the, upper, and, lower, cars, remain, horizontally, level, the, offset, distance, of, the, two, cars, changes, throughout, the, journey, there, are, four, elevator, cars, of, the, traditional, design, that, run, from, the, second, level, to, the, third, level, the, cars, are, connected, to, their, opposite, pairs, opposite, in, the, elevator, landing, hall, and, use, each, other, as, the, counterweight, as, one, car, ascends, from, level, 2, the, other, descends, from, level, 3, the, operations, of, these, elevators, are, synchronized, by, a, light, signal, in, the, car, the, statue, of, unity, the, world, s, tallest, statue, at, 182, metres, 597, ft, high, has, 10, high, speed, 4, metre, per, second, 13, ft, s, elevators, leading, up, to, a, viewing, gallery, 153, metres, 502, ft, high, double, deck, elevators, installed, by, toshiba, using, kone, ecodisc, machinery, are, used, in, the, taipei, 101, office, tower, tenants, of, even, numbered, floors, first, take, an, escalator, or, an, elevator, from, the, parking, garage, to, the, 2nd, level, where, they, will, enter, the, upper, deck, and, arrive, at, their, floors, the, lower, deck, is, turned, off, during, low, volume, hours, and, the, upper, deck, can, act, as, a, single, level, elevator, stopping, at, all, adjacent, floors, for, example, the, 85th, floor, restaurants, can, be, accessed, from, the, 60th, floor, sky, lobby, restaurant, customers, must, clear, their, reservations, at, the, reception, counter, on, the, 2nd, floor, a, bank, of, express, elevators, stop, only, on, the, sky, lobby, levels, 36, and, 60, upper, deck, car, where, tenants, can, transfer, to, local, elevators, the, high, speed, observation, deck, elevators, accelerate, to, a, former, world, record, certified, speed, of, 1, 010, metres, per, minute, 61, km, h, in, 16, seconds, and, then, it, slows, down, for, arrival, with, subtle, air, pressure, sensations, the, door, opens, after, 37, seconds, from, the, 5th, floor, special, features, include, aerodynamic, car, and, counterweights, and, cabin, pressure, control, to, help, passengers, adapt, smoothly, to, pressure, changes, the, downwards, journey, is, completed, at, a, reduced, speed, of, 600, meters, per, minute, with, the, doors, opening, at, the, 52nd, second, many, high, speed, elevators, also, have, aerodynamic, cab, exteriors, the, gateway, arch, in, st, louis, missouri, united, states, has, a, unique, montgomery, elevator, system, which, carries, passengers, from, the, visitors, center, underneath, the, arch, to, the, observation, deck, at, the, top, of, the, structure, called, a, tram, or, tramway, people, enter, this, unique, tramway, much, as, one, would, enter, an, ordinary, elevator, through, double, doors, passing, through, the, doors, the, passengers, in, small, groups, enter, a, horizontal, cylindrical, compartment, containing, seats, on, each, side, and, a, flat, floor, a, number, of, these, compartments, are, linked, to, form, a, train, these, compartments, each, individually, retain, an, appropriate, level, orientation, by, tilting, while, the, entire, train, follows, curved, tracks, up, one, leg, of, the, arch, there, are, two, tramways, within, the, arch, one, at, the, north, end, and, the, other, at, the, south, end, the, entry, doors, have, windows, so, people, traveling, within, the, arch, are, able, to, see, the, interior, structure, of, the, arch, during, the, ride, to, and, from, the, observation, deck, at, the, beginning, of, the, trip, the, cars, hang, from, the, drive, cables, but, as, the, angle, of, the, shaft, changes, they, end, up, beside, and, then, on, top, of, the, cables, the, elevator, in, the, new, city, hall, in, hanover, germany, is, a, technical, rarity, and, unique, in, europe, as, the, elevator, starts, straight, up, but, then, changes, its, angle, by, 15, degrees, to, follow, the, contour, of, the, dome, of, the, hall, the, cabin, therefore, tilts, 15, degrees, during, the, ride, the, elevator, travels, a, height, of, 43, meters, the, new, city, hall, was, built, in, 1913, the, elevator, was, destroyed, in, 1943, and, rebuilt, in, 1954, the, luxor, hotel, in, las, vegas, nevada, united, states, has, inclined, elevators, the, shape, of, this, casino, is, a, pyramid, and, the, elevator, travels, up, the, side, of, the, pyramid, at, a, 39, degree, angle, other, locations, with, inclined, elevators, include, the, cityplace, station, in, dallas, texas, the, huntington, metro, station, in, huntington, virginia, and, the, san, diego, convention, center, in, san, diego, california, at, the, radisson, blu, hotel, in, berlin, germany, the, main, elevator, was, surrounded, by, an, aquarium, 82, feet, tall, the, aquarium, contained, more, than, a, thousand, different, fish, until, it, shattered, in, december, 2022, the, design, offered, views, of, the, fish, to, people, using, the, elevator, the, special, elevator, was, built, by, the, german, company, gbh, design, gmbh, the, twilight, zone, tower, of, terror, is, the, common, name, for, a, series, of, elevator, attractions, at, the, disney, s, hollywood, studios, park, in, orlando, the, walt, disney, studios, park, in, paris, and, the, tokyo, disneysea, park, in, tokyo, the, central, element, of, this, attraction, is, a, simulated, free, fall, achieved, through, the, use, of, a, high, speed, elevator, system, for, safety, reasons, passengers, are, seated, and, secured, in, their, seats, rather, than, standing, unlike, most, traction, elevators, the, elevator, car, and, counterweight, are, joined, using, a, rail, system, in, a, continuous, loop, running, through, both, the, top, and, the, bottom, of, the, drop, shaft, this, allows, the, drive, motor, to, pull, down, on, the, elevator, car, from, underneath, resulting, in, downward, acceleration, greater, than, that, of, normal, gravity, the, high, speed, drive, motor, is, used, to, rapidly, lift, the, elevator, as, well, the, passenger, cabs, are, mechanically, separated, from, the, lift, mechanism, thus, allowing, the, elevator, shafts, to, be, used, continuously, while, passengers, board, and, embark, from, the, cabs, as, well, as, move, through, show, scenes, on, various, floors, the, passenger, cabs, which, are, automated, guided, vehicles, or, agvs, move, into, the, vertical, motion, shaft, and, lock, themselves, in, before, the, elevator, starts, moving, vertically, multiple, elevator, shafts, are, used, to, further, improve, passenger, throughput, the, doorways, of, the, top, few, floors, of, the, attraction, are, open, to, the, outdoor, environment, thus, allowing, passengers, to, look, out, from, the, top, of, the, structure, guests, ascending, to, the, 67th, 69th, and, 70th, level, observation, decks, dubbed, top, of, the, rock, atop, the, ge, building, at, rockefeller, center, in, new, york, city, ride, a, high, speed, glass, top, elevator, when, entering, the, cab, it, appears, to, be, any, normal, elevator, ride, however, once, the, cab, begins, moving, the, interior, lights, turn, off, and, a, special, blue, light, above, the, cab, turns, on, this, lights, the, entire, shaft, so, riders, can, see, the, moving, cab, through, its, glass, ceiling, as, it, rises, and, lowers, through, the, shaft, music, plays, and, various, animations, are, also, displayed, on, the, ceiling, the, entire, ride, takes, about, 60, seconds, part, of, the, haunted, mansion, attraction, at, disneyland, in, anaheim, california, and, disneyland, in, paris, france, takes, place, on, an, elevator, the, stretching, room, on, the, ride, is, actually, an, elevator, that, travels, downwards, giving, access, to, a, short, tunnel, which, leads, to, the, rest, of, the, attraction, the, elevator, has, no, ceiling, and, its, shaft, is, decorated, to, look, like, walls, of, a, mansion, because, there, is, no, roof, passengers, are, able, to, see, the, walls, of, the, shaft, by, looking, up, which, gives, the, illusion, of, the, room, stretching, in, some, towns, where, terrain, is, difficult, to, navigate, elevators, are, used, as, part, of, urban, transport, systems, examples, internet, of, things, iot, technology, application, is, being, used, in, elevators, to, improve, performance, operations, monitoring, maintenance, with, help, of, remote, diagnostics, real, time, notifications, and, predictive, behavioral, insights, the, guangzhou, ctf, finance, centre, holds, the, current, record, of, world, s, fastest, elevators, with, their, cars, traveling, at, 75, 6, km, h, 47, 0, mph, the, elevator, which, was, tested, out, the, speed, in, june, 2017, was, manufactured, by, hitachi, and, was, confirmed, a, guinness, world, record, sept, 2019, however, on, the, way, down, the, elevators, at, yokohama, landmark, tower, manufactured, by, mitsubishi, electric, descend, at, 45, km, h, 28, mph, and, still, hold, the, record, for, the, fastest, descending, elevator, in, the, world
