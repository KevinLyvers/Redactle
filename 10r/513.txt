pointed, two, edged, long, blade, wielded, in, one, hand, it, was, widely, popular, in, western, europe, throughout, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, as, a, symbol, of, nobility, or, gentleman,

military, side, arm, its, name, is, of, spanish, origin, and, appears, recorded, for, the, first, time, in, the, coplas, de, la, panadera, by, juan, de, mena, written, approximately, between, 1445, and, 1450, say, baker, a, wednesday, that, left, prince, enrique, to, look, for, some, good, bite, for, his, espada, ropera, he, left, without, another, wait, from, olmedo, such, a, great, company, that, with, very, beautiful, skill, to, the, port, was, withdrawn, fencing, spread, throughout, western, europe, and, important, sources, for, rapier, fencing, arose, in, spain, known, under, the, term, of, destreza, dexterity, in, the, italy, and, france, the, french, small, sword, or, court, sword, of, the, 18th, century, was, a, direct, continuation, of, this, tradition, of, fencing, rapier, fencing, forms, part, of, historical, european, martial, arts, the, origin, of, the, name, rapier, is, spanish, its, name, is, a, derisive, description, of, the, spanish, term, ropera, the, spanish, term, refers, to, a, sword, used, with, clothes, espada, ropera, dress, sword, due, to, it, being, used, as, an, accessory, for, clothing, usually, for, fashion, and, as, a, self, defense, weapon, the, english, term, rapier, comes, from, the, french, rapi, re, and, appears, both, in, english, and, german, near, simultaneously, in, the, mid, 16th, century, for, a, light, long, pointed, two, edged, sword, it, is, a, loan, from, middle, french, espee, rapiere, first, recorded, in, 1474, a, nickname, meaning, grater, the, 16th, century, german, rappier, described, what, was, considered, a, foreign, weapon, imported, from, spain, italy, and, france, du, cange, in, his, middle, latin, dictionary, cites, a, form, rapperia, from, a, latin, text, of, 1511, he, envisages, a, derivation, from, greek, rap, zein, to, strike, adelung, in, his, 1798, dictionary, records, a, double, meaning, for, the, german, verb, rappieren, to, fence, with, rapiers, on, one, hand, and, to, rasp, grate, specifically, of, tobacco, leaves, on, the, other, the, terms, used, by, the, spanish, italian, and, french, masters, during, the, heyday, of, this, weapon, were, simply, the, equivalent, of, sword, i, e, espada, spada, and, p, e, esp, e, when, it, was, necessary, to, specify, the, type, of, sword, the, spanish, used, espada, ropera, the, name, was, registered, for, the, first, time, in, las, coplas, de, la, panadera, by, juan, de, mena, written, between, 1445, and, 1450, approximately, clements, 1997, categorizes, thrusting, swords, with, poor, cutting, abilities, as, rapiers, and, swords, with, both, good, thrusting, and, cutting, abilities, as, cut, and, thrust, swords, the, term, rapier, is, also, applied, by, archaeologists, to, an, unrelated, type, of, bronze, age, sword, the, word, rapier, generally, refers, to, a, relatively, long, bladed, sword, characterized, by, a, protective, hilt, which, is, constructed, to, provide, protection, for, the, hand, wielding, the, sword, some, historical, rapier, samples, also, feature, a, broad, blade, mounted, on, a, typical, rapier, hilt, the, term, rapier, can, be, confusing, because, this, hybrid, weapon, can, be, categorized, as, a, type, of, broadsword, while, the, rapier, blade, might, be, broad, enough, to, cut, to, some, degree, but, nowhere, near, that, of, the, wider, swords, in, use, around, the, middle, ages, such, as, the, longsword, it, is, designed, to, perform, quick, and, nimble, thrusting, attacks, the, blade, might, be, sharpened, along, its, entire, length, or, sharpened, only, from, the, center, to, the, tip, as, described, by, capoferro, pallavicini, a, rapier, master, in, 1670, strongly, advocated, using, a, weapon, with, two, cutting, edges, a, typical, example, would, weigh, 1, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, and, have, a, relatively, long, and, slender, blade, of, 2, 5, centimetres, 0, 98, inches, or, less, in, width, 104, cm, 41, in, or, more, in, length, and, ending, in, a, sharply, pointed, tip, the, blade, length, of, quite, a, few, historical, examples, particularly, the, italian, rapiers, in, the, early, 17th, century, is, well, over, 115, cm, 45, in, and, can, even, reach, 130, cm, 51, in, the, term, rapier, generally, refers, to, a, thrusting, sword, with, a, blade, longer, and, thinner, than, that, of, the, so, called, side, sword, but, much, heavier, than, the, small, sword, a, lighter, weapon, that, would, follow, in, the, 18th, century, and, later, but, the, exact, form, of, the, blade, and, hilt, often, depends, on, who, is, writing, and, when, it, can, refer, to, earlier, spada, da, lato, and, the, similar, espada, ropera, through, the, high, rapier, period, of, the, 17th, century, through, the, small, sword, and, duelling, swords, thus, context, is, important, in, understanding, what, is, meant, by, the, word, the, term, side, sword, used, among, some, modern, historical, martial, arts, reconstructionists, is, a, translation, from, the, italian, spada, da, lato, a, term, coined, long, after, the, fact, by, italian, museum, curators, and, does, not, refer, to, the, slender, long, rapier, but, only, to, the, early, 16th, century, italian, sword, with, a, broader, and, shorter, blade, that, is, considered, both, its, ancestor, and, contemporary, rapiers, often, have, complex, sweeping, hilts, designed, to, protect, the, hand, wielding, the, sword, rings, extend, forward, from, the, crosspiece, in, some, later, samples, rings, are, covered, with, metal, plates, eventually, evolving, into, the, cup, hilts, of, many, later, rapiers, there, were, hardly, any, samples, that, featured, plates, covering, the, rings, prior, to, the, 1600s, many, hilts, include, a, knuckle, bow, extending, down, from, the, crosspiece, protecting, the, grip, which, was, usually, wood, wrapped, with, cord, leather, or, wire, a, large, pommel, often, decorated, secures, the, hilt, to, the, weapon, and, provides, some, weight, to, balance, the, long, blade, various, rapier, masters, divided, the, blade, into, two, three, four, five, or, even, nine, parts, the, forte, strong, is, that, part, of, the, blade, closest, to, the, hilt, in, cases, where, a, master, divides, the, blade, into, an, even, number, of, parts, this, is, the, first, half, of, the, blade, the, debole, weak, is, the, part, of, the, blade, which, includes, the, point, and, is, the, second, half, of, the, blade, when, the, sword, is, divided, into, an, even, number, of, parts, however, some, rapier, masters, divided, the, blade, into, three, parts, or, even, a, multiple, of, three, in, which, case, the, central, third, of, the, blade, between, the, forte, and, the, debole, was, often, called, the, medio, mezzo, or, the, terzo, others, used, four, divisions, fabris, or, even, 12, thibault, the, ricasso, is, the, rear, portion, of, the, blade, usually, unsharpened, it, extends, forward, from, the, crosspiece, or, quillion, and, then, gradually, integrates, into, the, thinner, and, sharper, portion, of, the, blade, there, was, historical, disagreement, over, how, long, the, ideal, rapier, should, be, with, some, masters, such, as, thibault, denigrating, those, who, recommended, longer, blades, thibault, s, own, recommended, length, was, such, that, the, cross, of, the, sword, be, level, with, the, navel, belly, button, when, standing, naturally, with, the, point, resting, on, the, ground, a, small, number, of, rapiers, with, extending, blades, were, made, of, which, four, survive, in, modern, collections, the, purpose, of, the, ability, is, unclear, with, suggestions, including, trying, to, gain, the, advantage, of, surprise, in, a, duel, or, an, attempt, to, get, around, laws, limiting, weapon, length, rapiers, are, single, handed, weapons, and, they, were, often, employed, with, off, hand, bucklers, daggers, cloaks, and, even, second, swords, to, assist, with, defense, a, buckler, is, a, small, round, shield, that, was, used, with, other, blades, as, well, such, as, the, arming, sword, in, capo, ferro, s, gran, simulacro, the, treatise, depicts, how, to, use, the, weapon, with, the, rotella, which, is, a, significantly, bigger, shield, compared, with, the, buckler, nevertheless, using, rapier, with, its, parrying, dagger, is, the, most, common, practice, and, it, has, been, arguably, considered, as, the, most, suited, and, effective, accompanying, weapon, for, the, rapier, even, though, the, slender, blade, of, rapier, enables, the, user, to, launch, quick, attack, at, a, fairly, long, and, advantaged, distance, between, the, user, and, the, opponent, and, the, protective, hilt, can, deflect, the, opponent, s, blade, when, he, or, she, uses, rapier, as, well, the, thrust, oriented, weapon, is, weakened, by, its, bated, cutting, power, and, relatively, low, maneuverability, at, a, closer, distance, where, the, opponent, has, safely, passed, the, reach, of, the, rapier, s, deadly, point, because, of, such, insufficient, cutting, power, and, maneuverability, at, this, situation, when, the, opponent, passes, the, deadly, point, this, scenario, leaves, opening, for, the, opponent, to, attack, the, user, therefore, some, close, range, protection, for, the, user, needs, to, be, ensured, if, the, user, intends, to, use, the, rapier, in, an, optimal, way, especially, when, the, opponent, uses, some, slash, oriented, sword, like, a, sabre, or, a, broadsword, a, parrying, dagger, not, only, enables, the, users, to, defend, in, this, scenario, in, which, the, rapier, is, not, very, good, at, protecting, the, user, but, also, enables, them, to, attack, in, such, close, distance, the, espada, ropera, of, the, 16th, century, was, a, cut, and, thrust, civilian, weapon, for, self, defense, and, the, duel, while, earlier, weapons, were, equally, at, home, on, the, battlefield, throughout, the, 16th, century, a, variety, of, new, single, handed, civilian, weapons, were, being, developed, in, 1570, the, italian, master, rocco, bonetti, first, settled, in, england, advocating, the, use, of, the, rapier, for, thrusting, as, opposed, to, cutting, or, slashing, when, engaged, in, a, duel, nevertheless, the, english, word, rapier, generally, refers, to, a, primarily, thrusting, weapon, developed, by, the, year, 1600, as, a, result, of, the, geometrical, theories, of, such, masters, as, camillo, agrippa, ridolfo, capo, ferro, and, vincentio, saviolo, the, rapier, became, extremely, fashionable, throughout, europe, with, the, wealthier, classes, but, was, not, without, its, detractors, some, people, such, as, george, silver, disapproved, of, its, technical, potential, and, the, dueling, use, to, which, it, was, put, allowing, for, fast, reactions, and, with, a, long, reach, the, rapier, was, well, suited, to, civilian, combat, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, as, military, style, cutting, and, thrusting, swords, continued, to, evolve, to, meet, needs, on, the, battlefield, the, rapier, continued, to, evolve, to, meet, the, needs, of, civilian, combat, and, decorum, eventually, becoming, lighter, shorter, and, less, cumbersome, to, wear, this, is, when, the, rapier, began, to, give, way, to, the, colichemarde, which, was, itself, later, superseded, by, the, small, sword, which, was, later, superseded, by, the, p, e, noticeably, there, were, some, war, rapiers, that, feature, a, relatively, wide, blade, mounted, on, a, typical, rapier, hilt, during, this, era, these, hybrid, swords, were, used, in, the, military, even, on, the, battlefield, the, sword, carried, by, king, gustavus, adolphus, in, the, thirty, years, war, is, a, typical, example, of, the, war, rapier, by, the, year, 1715, the, rapier, had, been, largely, replaced, by, the, lighter, small, sword, throughout, most, of, europe, although, the, former, continued, to, be, used, as, evidenced, by, the, treatises, of, donald, mcbane, 1728, p, j, f, girard, 1736, and, domenico, angelo, 1787, the, rapier, is, still, used, today, by, officers, of, the, swiss, guard, of, the, pope, classical, fencing, schools, claim, to, have, inherited, aspects, of, rapier, forms, in, their, systems, in, 1885, fencing, scholar, egerton, castle, wrote, there, is, little, doubt, that, the, french, system, of, fencing, can, be, traced, at, its, origin, to, the, ancient, italian, swordsmanship, the, modern, italian, school, being, of, course, derived, in, an, uninterrupted, manner, from, the, same, source, castle, went, on, to, note, that, the, italians, have, preserved, the, rapier, form, with, cup, pas, d, ane, and, quillons, but, with, a, slender, quadrangular, blade
