silk, is, a, natural, protein, fiber, some, forms, of, which, can, be, woven, into, textiles, the, protein, fiber, of, silk, is, composed, mainly, of, fibroin, and, is, produced, by, certain, insect, larvae, to, form, cocoons, the, best, known, silk, is, obtained, from, the, cocoons, of, the, larvae, of, the, mulberry, silkworm, bombyx, mori, reared, in, captivity, sericulture, the, shimmering, appearance, of, silk, is, due, to, the, triangular, prism, like, structure, of, the, silk, fibre, which, allows, silk, cloth, to, refract, incoming, light, at, different, angles, thus, producing, different, colors, silk, is, produced, by, several, insects, but, generally, only, the, silk, of, moth, caterpillars, has, been, used, for, textile, manufacturing, there, has, been, some, research, into, other, types, of, silk, which, differ, at, the, molecular, level, silk, is, mainly, produced, by, the, larvae, of, insects, undergoing, complete, metamorphosis, but, some, insects, such, as, webspinners, and, raspy, crickets, produce, silk, throughout, their, lives, silk, production, also, occurs, in, hymenoptera, bees, wasps, and, ants, silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and, midges, other, types, of, arthropods, produce, silk, most, notably, various, arachnids, such, as, spiders, the, word, silk, comes, from, old, english, sioloc, from, latin, sericum, and, ancient, greek, romanized, s, rik, s, silken, ultimately, from, the, chinese, word, s, and, other, asian, sources, compare, mandarin, s, silk, manchurian, sirghe, mongolian, sirkek, the, production, of, silk, originated, in, china, in, the, neolithic, period, although, it, would, eventually, reach, other, places, of, the, world, yangshao, culture, 4th, millennium, bc, silk, production, remained, confined, to, china, until, the, silk, road, opened, at, some, point, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, though, china, maintained, its, virtual, monopoly, over, silk, production, for, another, thousand, years, several, kinds, of, wild, silk, produced, by, caterpillars, other, than, the, mulberry, silkworm, have, been, known, and, spun, in, china, south, asia, and, europe, since, ancient, times, e, g, the, production, of, eri, silk, in, assam, india, however, the, scale, of, production, was, always, far, smaller, than, for, cultivated, silks, there, are, several, reasons, for, this, first, they, differ, from, the, domesticated, varieties, in, colour, and, texture, and, are, therefore, less, uniform, second, cocoons, gathered, in, the, wild, have, usually, had, the, pupa, emerge, from, them, before, being, discovered, so, the, silk, thread, that, makes, up, the, cocoon, has, been, torn, into, shorter, lengths, and, third, many, wild, cocoons, are, covered, in, a, mineral, layer, that, prevents, attempts, to, reel, from, them, long, strands, of, silk, thus, the, only, way, to, obtain, silk, suitable, for, spinning, into, textiles, in, areas, where, commercial, silks, are, not, cultivated, was, by, tedious, and, labor, intensive, carding, some, natural, silk, structures, have, been, used, without, being, unwound, or, spun, spider, webs, were, used, as, a, wound, dressing, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, and, as, a, base, for, painting, from, the, 16th, century, caterpillar, nests, were, pasted, together, to, make, a, fabric, in, the, aztec, empire, commercial, silks, originate, from, reared, silkworm, pupae, which, are, bred, to, produce, a, white, colored, silk, thread, with, no, mineral, on, the, surface, the, pupae, are, killed, by, either, dipping, them, in, boiling, water, before, the, adult, moths, emerge, or, by, piercing, them, with, a, needle, these, factors, all, contribute, to, the, ability, of, the, whole, cocoon, to, be, unravelled, as, one, continuous, thread, permitting, a, much, stronger, cloth, to, be, woven, from, the, silk, wild, silks, also, tend, to, be, more, difficult, to, dye, than, silk, from, the, cultivated, silkworm, a, technique, known, as, demineralizing, allows, the, mineral, layer, around, the, cocoon, of, wild, silk, moths, to, be, removed, leaving, only, variability, in, color, as, a, barrier, to, creating, a, commercial, silk, industry, based, on, wild, silks, in, the, parts, of, the, world, where, wild, silk, moths, thrive, such, as, in, africa, and, south, america, silk, use, in, fabric, was, first, developed, in, ancient, china, the, earliest, evidence, for, silk, is, the, presence, of, the, silk, protein, fibroin, in, soil, samples, from, two, tombs, at, the, neolithic, site, jiahu, in, henan, which, date, back, about, 8, 500, years, the, earliest, surviving, example, of, silk, fabric, dates, from, about, 3630, bc, and, was, used, as, the, wrapping, for, the, body, of, a, child, at, a, yangshao, culture, site, in, qingtaicun, near, xingyang, henan, legend, gives, credit, for, developing, silk, to, a, chinese, empress, leizu, hsi, ling, shih, lei, tzu, silks, were, originally, reserved, for, the, emperors, of, china, for, their, own, use, and, gifts, to, others, but, spread, gradually, through, chinese, culture, and, trade, both, geographically, and, socially, and, then, to, many, regions, of, asia, because, of, its, texture, and, lustre, silk, rapidly, became, a, popular, luxury, fabric, in, the, many, areas, accessible, to, chinese, merchants, silk, was, in, great, demand, and, became, a, staple, of, pre, industrial, international, trade, silk, was, also, used, as, a, surface, for, writing, especially, during, the, warring, states, period, 475, 221, bce, the, fabric, was, light, it, survived, the, damp, climate, of, the, yangtze, region, absorbed, ink, well, and, provided, a, white, background, for, the, text, in, july, 2007, archaeologists, discovered, intricately, woven, and, dyed, silk, textiles, in, a, tomb, in, jiangxi, province, dated, to, the, eastern, zhou, dynasty, roughly, 2, 500, years, ago, although, historians, have, suspected, a, long, history, of, a, formative, textile, industry, in, ancient, china, this, find, of, silk, textiles, employing, complicated, techniques, of, weaving, and, dyeing, provides, direct, evidence, for, silks, dating, before, the, mawangdui, discovery, and, other, silks, dating, to, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, silk, is, described, in, a, chapter, of, the, fan, shengzhi, shu, from, the, western, han, 202, bc, 9, ad, there, is, a, surviving, calendar, for, silk, production, in, an, eastern, han, 25, 220, ad, document, the, two, other, known, works, on, silk, from, the, han, period, are, lost, the, first, evidence, of, the, long, distance, silk, trade, is, the, finding, of, silk, in, the, hair, of, an, egyptian, mummy, of, the, 21st, dynasty, c, 1070, bc, the, silk, trade, reached, as, far, as, the, indian, subcontinent, the, middle, east, europe, and, north, africa, this, trade, was, so, extensive, that, the, major, set, of, trade, routes, between, europe, and, asia, came, to, be, known, as, the, silk, road, the, emperors, of, china, strove, to, keep, knowledge, of, sericulture, secret, to, maintain, the, chinese, monopoly, nonetheless, sericulture, reached, korea, with, technological, aid, from, china, around, 200, bc, the, ancient, kingdom, of, khotan, by, ad, 50, and, india, by, ad, 140, in, the, ancient, era, silk, from, china, was, the, most, lucrative, and, sought, after, luxury, item, traded, across, the, eurasian, continent, and, many, civilizations, such, as, the, ancient, persians, benefited, economically, from, trade, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, sericulture, has, been, practiced, since, the, yayoi, period, the, silk, industry, was, dominant, from, the, 1930s, to, 1950s, but, is, less, common, now, silk, from, east, asia, had, declined, in, importance, after, silkworms, were, smuggled, from, china, to, the, byzantine, empire, however, in, 1845, an, epidemic, of, flacherie, among, european, silkworms, devastated, the, silk, industry, there, this, led, to, a, demand, for, silk, from, china, and, japan, where, as, late, as, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, japanese, exports, competed, directly, with, chinese, in, the, international, market, in, such, low, value, added, labor, intensive, products, as, raw, silk, between, 1850, and, 1930, raw, silk, ranked, as, the, leading, export, for, both, countries, accounting, for, 20, 40, of, japan, s, total, exports, and, 20, 30, of, china, s, between, the, 1890s, and, the, 1930s, japanese, silk, exports, quadrupled, making, japan, the, largest, silk, exporter, in, the, world, this, increase, in, exports, was, mostly, due, to, the, economic, reforms, during, the, meiji, period, and, the, decline, of, the, qing, dynasty, in, china, which, led, to, rapid, industrialization, of, japan, whilst, the, chinese, industries, stagnated, during, world, war, ii, embargoes, against, japan, had, led, to, adoption, of, synthetic, materials, such, as, nylon, which, led, to, the, decline, of, the, japanese, silk, industry, and, its, position, as, the, lead, silk, exporter, of, the, world, today, china, exports, the, largest, volume, of, raw, silk, in, the, world, silk, has, a, long, history, in, india, it, is, known, as, resham, in, eastern, and, north, india, and, pattu, in, southern, parts, of, india, recent, archaeological, discoveries, in, harappa, and, chanhu, daro, suggest, that, sericulture, employing, wild, silk, threads, from, native, silkworm, species, existed, in, south, asia, during, the, time, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, now, in, pakistan, and, india, dating, between, 2450, bc, and, 2000, bc, shelagh, vainker, a, silk, expert, at, the, ashmolean, museum, in, oxford, who, sees, evidence, for, silk, production, in, china, significantly, earlier, than, 2500, 2000, bc, suggests, people, of, the, indus, civilization, either, harvested, silkworm, cocoons, or, traded, with, people, who, did, and, that, they, knew, a, considerable, amount, about, silk, india, is, the, second, largest, producer, of, silk, in, the, world, after, china, about, 97, of, the, raw, mulberry, silk, comes, from, six, indian, states, namely, andhra, pradesh, karnataka, jammu, and, kashmir, tamil, nadu, bihar, and, west, bengal, north, bangalore, the, upcoming, site, of, a, 20, million, silk, city, ramanagara, and, mysore, contribute, to, a, majority, of, silk, production, in, karnataka, in, tamil, nadu, mulberry, cultivation, is, concentrated, in, the, coimbatore, erode, bhagalpuri, tiruppur, salem, and, dharmapuri, districts, hyderabad, andhra, pradesh, and, gobichettipalayam, tamil, nadu, were, the, first, locations, to, have, automated, silk, reeling, units, in, india, in, the, northeastern, state, of, assam, three, different, types, of, indigenous, variety, of, silk, are, produced, collectively, called, assam, silk, muga, silk, eri, silk, and, pat, silk, muga, the, golden, silk, and, eri, are, produced, by, silkworms, that, are, native, only, to, assam, they, have, been, reared, since, ancient, times, similar, to, other, east, and, south, east, asian, countries, silk, is, produced, year, round, in, thailand, by, two, types, of, silkworms, the, cultured, bombycidae, and, wild, saturniidae, most, production, is, after, the, rice, harvest, in, the, southern, and, northeastern, parts, of, the, country, women, traditionally, weave, silk, on, hand, looms, and, pass, the, skill, on, to, their, daughters, as, weaving, is, considered, to, be, a, sign, of, maturity, and, eligibility, for, marriage, thai, silk, textiles, often, use, complicated, patterns, in, various, colours, and, styles, most, regions, of, thailand, have, their, own, typical, silks, a, single, thread, filament, is, too, thin, to, use, on, its, own, so, women, combine, many, threads, to, produce, a, thicker, usable, fiber, they, do, this, by, hand, reeling, the, threads, onto, a, wooden, spindle, to, produce, a, uniform, strand, of, raw, silk, the, process, takes, around, 40, hours, to, produce, a, half, kilogram, of, silk, many, local, operations, use, a, reeling, machine, for, this, task, but, some, silk, threads, are, still, hand, reeled, the, difference, is, that, hand, reeled, threads, produce, three, grades, of, silk, two, fine, grades, that, are, ideal, for, lightweight, fabrics, and, a, thick, grade, for, heavier, material, the, silk, fabric, is, soaked, in, extremely, cold, water, and, bleached, before, dyeing, to, remove, the, natural, yellow, coloring, of, thai, silk, yarn, to, do, this, skeins, of, silk, thread, are, immersed, in, large, tubs, of, hydrogen, peroxide, once, washed, and, dried, the, silk, is, woven, on, a, traditional, hand, operated, loom, the, rajshahi, division, of, northern, bangladesh, is, the, hub, of, the, country, s, silk, industry, there, are, three, types, of, silk, produced, in, the, region, mulberry, endi, and, tassar, bengali, silk, was, a, major, item, of, international, trade, for, centuries, it, was, known, as, ganges, silk, in, medieval, europe, bengal, was, the, leading, exporter, of, silk, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, the, 7th, century, ce, murals, of, afrasiyab, in, samarkand, sogdiana, show, a, chinese, embassy, carrying, silk, and, a, string,

jewish, sources, and, books, of, the, bible, into, arabic, rabbi, saadia, gaon, translates, this, phrase, explicitly, as, crimson, silk, in, islamic, teachings, muslim, men, are, forbidden, to, wear, silk, many, religious, jurists, believe, the, reasoning, behind, the, prohibition, lies, in, avoiding, clothing, for, men, that, can, be, considered, feminine, or, extravagant, there, are, disputes, regarding, the, amount, of, silk, a, fabric, can, consist, of, e, g, whether, a, small, decorative, silk, piece, on, a, cotton, caftan, is, permissible, or, not, for, it, to, be, lawful, for, men, to, wear, but, the, dominant, opinion, of, most, muslim, scholars, is, that, the, wearing, of, silk, by, men, is, forbidden, modern, attire, has, raised, a, number, of, issues, including, for, instance, the, permissibility, of, wearing, silk, neckties, which, are, masculine, articles, of, clothing, in, the, odyssey, 19, 233, when, odysseus, while, pretending, to, be, someone, else, is, questioned,

passed, that, forbade, men, from, wearing, silk, garments, but, these, proved, ineffectual, the, historia, augusta, mentions, that, the, third, century, emperor, elagabalus, was, the, first, roman, to, wear, garments, of, pure, silk, whereas, it, had, been, customary, to, wear, fabrics, of, silk, cotton, or, silk, linen, blends, despite, the, popularity, of, silk, the, secret, of, silk, making, only, reached, europe, around, ad, 550, via, the, byzantine, empire, contemporary, accounts, state, that, monks, working, for, the, emperor, justinian, i, smuggled, silkworm, eggs, to, constantinople, from, china, inside, hollow, canes, all, top, quality, looms, and, weavers, were, located, inside, the, great, palace, complex, in, constantinople, and, the, cloth, produced, was, used, in, imperial, robes, or, in, diplomacy, as, gifts, to, foreign, dignitaries, the, remainder, was, sold, at, very, high, prices, italy, was, the, most, important, producer, of, silk, during, the, medieval, age, the, first, center, to, introduce, silk, production, to, italy, was, the, city, of, catanzaro, during, the, 11th, century, in, the, region, of, calabria, the, silk, of, catanzaro, supplied, almost, all, of, europe, and, was, sold, in, a, large, market, fair, in, the, port, of, reggio, calabria, to, spanish, venetian, genovese, and, dutch, merchants, catanzaro, became, the, lace, capital, of, the, world, with, a, large, silkworm, breeding, facility, that, produced, all, the, laces, and, linens, used, in, the, vatican, the, city, was, world, famous, for, its, fine, fabrication, of, silks, velvets, damasks, and, brocades, another, notable, center, was, the, italian, city, state, of, lucca, which, largely, financed, itself, through, silk, production, and, silk, trading, beginning, in, the, 12th, century, other, italian, cities, involved, in, silk, production, were, genoa, venice, and, florence, the, piedmont, area, of, northern, italy, became, a, major, silk, producing, area, when, water, powered, silk, throwing, machines, were, developed, the, silk, exchange, in, valencia, from, the, 15th, century, where, previously, in, 1348, also, perxal, percale, was, traded, as, some, kind, of, silk, illustrates, the, power, and, wealth, of, one, of, the, great, mediterranean, mercantile, cities, silk, was, produced, in, and, exported, from, the, province, of, granada, spain, especially, the, alpujarras, region, until, the, moriscos, whose, industry, it, was, were, expelled, from, granada, in, 1571, since, the, 15th, century, silk, production, in, france, has, been, centered, around, the, city, of, lyon, where, many, mechanic, tools, for, mass, production, were, first, introduced, in, the, 17th, century, james, i, attempted, to, establish, silk, production, in, england, purchasing, and, planting, 100, 000, mulberry, trees, some, on, land, adjacent, to, hampton, court, palace, but, they, were, of, a, species, unsuited, to, the, silk, worms, and, the, attempt, failed, in, 1732, john, guardivaglio, set, up, a, silk, throwing, enterprise, at, logwood, mill, in, stockport, in, 1744, burton, mill, was, erected, in, macclesfield, and, in, 1753, old, mill, was, built, in, congleton, these, three, towns, remained, the, centre, of, the, english, silk, throwing, industry, until, silk, throwing, was, replaced, by, silk, waste, spinning, british, enterprise, also, established, silk, filature, in, cyprus, in, 1928, in, england, in, the, mid, 20th, century, raw, silk, was, produced, at, lullingstone, castle, in, kent, silkworms, were, raised, and, reeled, under, the, direction, of, zoe, lady, hart, dyke, later, moving, to, ayot, st, lawrence, in, hertfordshire, in, 1956, during, world, war, ii, supplies, of, silk, for, uk, parachute, manufacture, were, secured, from, the, middle, east, by, peter, gaddum, wild, silk, taken, from, the, nests, of, native, caterpillars, was, used, by, the, aztecs, to, make, containers, and, as, paper, silkworms, were, introduced, to, oaxaca, from, spain, in, the, 1530s, and, the, region, profited, from, silk, production, until, the, early, 17th, century, when, the, king, of, spain, banned, export, to, protect, spain, s, silk, industry, silk, production, for, local, consumption, has, continued, until, the, present, day, sometimes, spinning, wild, silk, king, james, i, introduced, silk, growing, to, the, british, colonies, in, america, around, 1619, ostensibly, to, discourage, tobacco, planting, the, shakers, in, kentucky, adopted, the, practice, the, history, of, industrial, silk, in, the, united, states, is, largely, tied, to, several, smaller, urban, centers, in, the, northeast, region, beginning, in, the, 1830s, manchester, connecticut, emerged, as, the, early, center, of, the, silk, industry, in, america, when, the, cheney, brothers, became, the, first, in, the, united, states, to, properly, raise, silkworms, on, an, industrial, scale, today, the, cheney, brothers, historic, district, showcases, their, former, mills, with, the, mulberry, tree, craze, of, that, decade, other, smaller, producers, began, raising, silkworms, this, economy, particularly, gained, traction, in, the, vicinity, of, northampton, massachusetts, and, its, neighboring, williamsburg, where, a, number, of, small, firms, and, cooperatives, emerged, among, the, most, prominent, of, these, was, the, cooperative, utopian, northampton, association, for, education, and, industry, of, which, sojourner, truth, was, a, member, following, the, destructive, mill, river, flood, of, 1874, one, manufacturer, william, skinner, relocated, his, mill, from, williamsburg, to, the, then, new, city, of, holyoke, over, the, next, 50, years, he, and, his, sons, would, maintain, relations, between, the, american, silk, industry, and, its, counterparts, in, japan, and, expanded, their, business, to, the, point, that, by, 1911, the, skinner, mill, complex, contained, the, largest, silk, mill, under, one, roof, in, the, world, and, the, brand, skinner, fabrics, had, become, the, largest, manufacturer, of, silk, satins, internationally, other, efforts, later, in, the, 19th, century, would, also, bring, the, new, silk, industry, to, paterson, new, jersey, with, several, firms, hiring, european, born, textile, workers, and, granting, it, the, nickname, silk, city, as, another, major, center, of, production, in, the, united, states, world, war, ii, interrupted, the, silk, trade, from, asia, and, silk, prices, increased, dramatically, u, s, industry, began, to, look, for, substitutes, which, led, to, the, use, of, synthetics, such, as, nylon, synthetic, silks, have, also, been, made, from, lyocell, a, type, of, cellulose, fiber, and, are, often, difficult, to, distinguish, from, real, silk, see, spider, silk, for, more, on, synthetic, silks, in, terengganu, which, is, now, part, of, malaysia, a, second, generation, of, silkworm, was, being, imported, as, early, as, 1764, for, the, country, s, silk, textile, industry, especially, songket, however, since, the, 1980s, malaysia, is, no, longer, engaged, in, sericulture, but, does, plant, mulberry, trees, in, vietnamese, legend, silk, appeared, in, the, first, millennium, ad, and, is, still, being, woven, today, the, process, of, silk, production, is, known, as, sericulture, the, entire, production, process, of, silk, can, be, divided, into, several, steps, which, are, typically, handled, by, different, entities, extracting, raw, silk, starts, by, cultivating, the, silkworms, on, mulberry, leaves, once, the, worms, start, pupating, in, their, cocoons, these, are, dissolved, in, boiling, water, in, order, for, individual, long, fibres, to, be, extracted, and, fed, into, the, spinning, reel, to, produce, 1, kg, of, silk, 104, kg, of, mulberry, leaves, must, be, eaten, by, 3000, silkworms, it, takes, about, 5000, silkworms, to, make, a, pure, silk, kimono, 104, the, major, silk, producers, are, china, 54, and, india, 14, other, statistics, production, in, int, 1000, have, been, calculated, based, on, 1999, 2001, international, prices, source, food, and, agricultural, organization, of, united, nations, economic, and, social, department, the, statistical, division, the, environmental, impact, of, silk, production, is, potentially, large, when, compared, with, other, natural, fibers, a, life, cycle, assessment, of, indian, silk, production, shows, that, the, production, process, has, a, large, carbon, and, water, footprint, mainly, due, to, the, fact, that, it, is, an, animal, derived, fiber, and, more, inputs, such, as, fertilizer, and, water, are, needed, per, unit, of, fiber, produced, silk, fibers, from, the, bombyx, mori, silkworm, have, a, triangular, cross, section, with, rounded, corners, 5, 10, m, wide, the, fibroin, heavy, chain, is, composed, mostly, of, beta, sheets, due, to, a, 59, mer, amino, acid, repeat, sequence, with, some, variations, the, flat, surfaces, of, the, fibrils, reflect, light, at, many, angles, giving, silk, a, natural, sheen, the, cross, section, from, other, silkworms, can, vary, in, shape, and, diameter, crescent, like, for, anaphe, and, elongated, wedge, for, tussah, silkworm, fibers, are, naturally, extruded, from, two, silkworm, glands, as, a, pair, of, primary, filaments, brin, which, are, stuck, together, with, sericin, proteins, that, act, like, glue, to, form, a, bave, bave, diameters, for, tussah, silk, can, reach, 65, m, see, cited, reference, for, cross, sectional, sem, photographs, silk, has, a, smooth, soft, texture, that, is, not, slippery, unlike, many, synthetic, fibers, silk, is, one, of, the, strongest, natural, fibers, but, it, loses, up, to, 20, of, its, strength, when, wet, it, has, a, good, moisture, regain, of, 11, its, elasticity, is, moderate, to, poor, if, elongated, even, a, small, amount, it, remains, stretched, it, can, be, weakened, if, exposed, to, too, much, sunlight, it, may, also, be, attacked, by, insects, especially, if, left, dirty, one, example, of, the, durable, nature, of, silk, over, other, fabrics, is, demonstrated, by, the, recovery, in, 1840, of, silk, garments, from, a, wreck, of, 1782, the, most, durable, article, found, has, been, silk, for, besides, pieces, of, cloaks, and, lace, a, pair, of, black, satin, breeches, and, a, large, satin, waistcoat, with, flaps, were, got, up, of, which, the, silk, was, perfect, but, the, lining, entirely, gone, from, the, thread, giving, way, no, articles, of, dress, of, woollen, cloth, have, yet, been, found, silk, is, a, poor, conductor, of, electricity, and, thus, susceptible, to, static, cling, silk, has, a, high, emissivity, for, infrared, light, making, it, feel, cool, to, the, touch, unwashed, silk, chiffon, may, shrink, up, to, 8, due, to, a, relaxation, of, the, fiber, macrostructure, so, silk, should, either, be, washed, prior, to, garment, construction, or, dry, cleaned, dry, cleaning, may, still, shrink, the, chiffon, up, to, 4, occasionally, this, shrinkage, can, be, reversed, by, a, gentle, steaming, with, a, press, cloth, there, is, almost, no, gradual, shrinkage, nor, shrinkage, due, to, molecular, level, deformation, natural, and, synthetic, silk, is, known, to, manifest, piezoelectric, properties, in, proteins, probably, due, to, its, molecular, structure, silkworm, silk, was, used, as, the, standard, for, the, denier, a, measurement, of, linear, density, in, fibers, silkworm, silk, therefore, has, a, linear, density, of, approximately, 1, den, or, 1, 1, dtex, silk, emitted, by, the, silkworm, consists, of, two, main, proteins, sericin, and, fibroin, fibroin, being, the, structural, center, of, the, silk, and, sericin, being, the, sticky, material, surrounding, it, fibroin, is, made, up, of, the, amino, acids, gly, ser, gly, ala, gly, ala, and, forms, beta, pleated, sheets, hydrogen, bonds, form, between, chains, and, side, chains, are, oriented, above, and, below, the, plane, of, the, hydrogen, bond, network, the, high, proportion, 50, of, glycine, allows, tight, packing, this, is, because, glycine, has, no, side, chain, and, is, therefore, unencumbered, by, steric, strain, the, addition, of, alanine, and, serine, makes, the, fibres, strong, and, resistant, to, breaking, this, tensile, strength, is, due, to, the, many, interceded, hydrogen, bonds, and, when, stretched, the, force, is, applied, to, these, numerous, bonds, and, they, do, not, break, silk, resists, most, mineral, acids, except, for, sulfuric, acid, which, dissolves, it, it, is, yellowed, by, perspiration, chlorine, bleach, will, also, destroy, silk, fabrics, rsf, is, produced, by, chemically, dissolving, silkworm, cocoons, leaving, their, molecular, structure, intact, the, silk, fibers, dissolve, into, tiny, thread, like, structures, known, as, microfibrils, the, resulting, solution, is, extruded, through, a, small, opening, causing, the, microfibrils, to, reassemble, into, a, single, fiber, the, resulting, material, is, reportedly, twice, as, stiff, as, silk, silk, s, absorbency, makes, it, comfortable, to, wear, in, warm, weather, and, while, active, its, low, conductivity, keeps, warm, air, close, to, the, skin, during, cold, weather, it, is, often, used, for, clothing, such, as, shirts, ties, blouses, formal, dresses, high, fashion, clothes, lining, lingerie, pajamas, robes, dress, suits, sun, dresses, and, traditional, asian, clothing, silk, is, also, excellent, for, insect, proof, clothing, protecting, the, wearer, from, mosquitoes, and, horseflies, fabrics, that, are, often, made, from, silk, include, satin, charmeuse, habutai, chiffon, taffeta, cr, pe, de, chine, dupioni, noil, tussah, and, shantung, among, others, silk, s, attractive, lustre, and, drape, makes, it, suitable, for, many, furnishing, applications, it, is, used, for, upholstery, wall, coverings, window, treatments, if, blended, with, another, fiber, rugs, bedding, and, wall, hangings, silk, had, many, industrial, and, commercial, uses, such, as, in, parachutes, bicycle, tires, comforter, filling, and, artillery, gunpowder, bags, a, special, manufacturing, process, removes, the, outer, sericin, coating, of, the, silk, which, makes, it, suitable, as, non, absorbable, surgical, sutures, sometimes, wearing, silk, is, suggested, for, people, with, atopic, dermatitis, but, even, though, it, is, safe, for, the, skin, it, does, not, improve, symptoms, of, the, condition, silk, began, to, serve, as, a, biomedical, material, for, sutures, in, surgeries, as, early, as, the, second, century, ce, in, the, past, 30, years, it, has, been, widely, studied, and, used, as, a, biomaterial, due, to, its, mechanical, strength, biocompatibility, tunable, degradation, rate, ease, to, load, cellular, growth, factors, for, example, bmp, 2, and, its, ability, to, be, processed, into, several, other, formats, such, as, films, gels, particles, and, scaffolds, silks, from, bombyx, mori, a, kind, of, cultivated, silkworm, are, the, most, widely, investigated, silks, silks, derived, from, bombyx, mori, are, generally, made, of, two, parts, the, silk, fibroin, fiber, which, contains, a, light, chain, of, 25, kda, and, a, heavy, chain, of, 350, kda, or, 390, kda, linked, by, a, single, disulfide, bond, and, a, glue, like, protein, sericin, comprising, 25, to, 30, percentage, by, weight, silk, fibroin, contains, hydrophobic, beta, sheet, blocks, interrupted, by, small, hydrophilic, groups, the, beta, sheets, contribute, much, to, the, high, mechanical, strength, of, silk, fibers, which, achieves, 740, mpa, tens, of, times, that, of, poly, lactic, acid, and, hundreds, of, times, that, of, collagen, this, impressive, mechanical, strength, has, made, silk, fibroin, very, competitive, for, applications, in, biomaterials, indeed, silk, fibers, have, found, their, way, into, tendon, tissue, engineering, where, mechanical, properties, matter, greatly, in, addition, mechanical, properties, of, silks, from, various, kinds, of, silkworms, vary, widely, which, provides, more, choices, for, their, use, in, tissue, engineering, most, products, fabricated, from, regenerated, silk, are, weak, and, brittle, with, only, 1, 2, of, the, mechanical, strength, of, native, silk, fibers, due, to, the, absence, of, appropriate, secondary, and, hierarchical, structure, g, den, g, den, strain, biocompatibility, i, e, to, what, level, the, silk, will, cause, an, immune, response, is, a, critical, issue, for, biomaterials, the, issue, arose, during, its, increasing, clinical, use, wax, or, silicone, is, usually, used, as, a, coating, to, avoid, fraying, and, potential, immune, responses, when, silk, fibers, serve, as, suture, materials, although, the, lack, of, detailed, characterization, of, silk, fibers, such, as, the, extent, of, the, removal, of, sericin, the, surface, chemical, properties, of, coating, material, and, the, process, used, make, it, difficult, to, determine, the, real, immune, response, of, silk, fibers, in, literature, it, is, generally, believed, that, sericin, is, the, major, cause, of, immune, response, thus, the, removal, of, sericin, is, an, essential, step, to, assure, biocompatibility, in, biomaterial, applications, of, silk, however, further, research, fails, to, prove, clearly, the, contribution, of, sericin, to, inflammatory, responses, based, on, isolated, sericin, and, sericin, based, biomaterials, in, addition, silk, fibroin, exhibits, an, inflammatory, response, similar, to, that, of, tissue, culture, plastic, in, vitro, when, assessed, with, human, mesenchymal, stem, cells, hmscs, or, lower, than, collagen, and, pla, when, implant, rat, mscs, with, silk, fibroin, films, in, vivo, thus, appropriate, degumming, and, sterilization, will, assure, the, biocompatibility, of, silk, fibroin, which, is, further, validated, by, in, vivo, experiments, on, rats, and, pigs, there, are, still, concerns, about, the, long, term, safety, of, silk, based, biomaterials, in, the, human, body, in, contrast, to, these, promising, results, even, though, silk, sutures, serve, well, they, exist, and, interact, within, a, limited, period, depending, on, the, recovery, of, wounds, several, weeks, much, shorter, than, that, in, tissue, engineering, another, concern, arises, from, biodegradation, because, the, biocompatibility, of, silk, fibroin, does, not, necessarily, assure, the, biocompatibility, of, the, decomposed, products, in, fact, different, levels, of, immune, responses, and, diseases, have, been, triggered, by, the, degraded, products, of, silk, fibroin, biodegradability, also, known, as, biodegradation, the, ability, to, be, disintegrated, by, biological, approaches, including, bacteria, fungi, and, cells, is, another, significant, property, of, biomaterials, biodegradable, materials, can, minimize, the, pain, of, patients, from, surgeries, especially, in, tissue, engineering, since, there, is, no, need, for, surgery, in, order, to, remove, the, implanted, scaffold, wang, et, al, showed, the, in, vivo, degradation, of, silk, via, aqueous, 3d, scaffolds, implanted, into, lewis, rats, enzymes, are, the, means, used, to, achieve, degradation, of, silk, in, vitro, protease, xiv, from, streptomyces, griseus, and, chymotrypsin, from, bovine, pancreases, are, two, popular, enzymes, for, silk, degradation, in, addition, gamma, radiation, as, well, as, cell, metabolism, can, also, regulate, the, degradation, of, silk, compared, with, synthetic, biomaterials, such, as, polyglycolides, and, polylactides, silk, is, advantageous, in, some, aspects, of, biodegradation, the, acidic, degraded, products, of, polyglycolides, and, polylactides, will, decrease, the, ph, of, the, ambient, environment, and, thus, adversely, influence, the, metabolism, of, cells, which, is, not, an, issue, for, silk, in, addition, silk, materials, can, retain, strength, over, a, desired, period, from, weeks, to, months, on, an, as, needed, basis, by, mediating, the, content, of, beta, sheets, genetic, modification, of, domesticated, silkworms, has, been, used, to, alter, the, composition, of, the, silk, as, well, as, possibly, facilitating, the, production, of, more, useful, types, of, silk, this, may, allow, other, industrially, or, therapeutically, useful, proteins, to, be, made, by, silkworms, silk, moths, lay, eggs, on, specially, prepared, paper, the, eggs, hatch, and, the, caterpillars, silkworms, are, fed, fresh, mulberry, leaves, after, about, 35, days, and, 4, moltings, the, caterpillars, are, 10, 000, times, heavier, than, when, hatched, and, are, ready, to, begin, spinning, a, cocoon, a, straw, frame, is, placed, over, the, tray, of, caterpillars, and, each, caterpillar, begins, spinning, a, cocoon, by, moving, its, head, in, a, pattern, two, glands, produce, liquid, silk, and, force, it, through, openings, in, the, head, called, spinnerets, liquid, silk, is, coated, in, sericin, a, water, soluble, protective, gum, and, solidifies, on, contact, with, the, air, within, 2, 3, days, the, caterpillar, spins, about, one, mile, 1, 6, km, of, filament, and, is, completely, encased, in, a, cocoon, the, silk, farmers, then, heat, the, cocoons, to, kill, them, leaving, some, to, metamorphose, into, moths, to, breed, the, next, generation, of, caterpillars, harvested, cocoons, are, then, soaked, in, boiling, water, to, soften, the, sericin, holding, the, silk, fibers, together, in, a, cocoon, shape, the, fibers, are, then, unwound, to, produce, a, continuous, thread, since, a, single, thread, is, too, fine, and, fragile, for, commercial, use, anywhere, from, three, to, ten, strands, are, spun, together, to, form, a, single, thread, of, silk, as, the, process, of, harvesting, the, silk, from, the, cocoon, kills, the, larvae, by, boiling, sericulture, has, been, criticized, by, animal, welfare, activists, including, people, for, the, ethical, treatment, of, animals, peta, who, urge, people, not, to, buy, silk, items, mahatma, gandhi, was, critical, of, silk, production, because, of, his, ahimsa, non, violent, philosophy, which, led, to, the, promotion, of, cotton, and, ahimsa, silk, a, type, of, wild, silk, made, from, the, cocoons, of, wild, and, semi, wild, silk, moths
