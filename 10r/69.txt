android, is, a, mobile, operating, system, based, on, a, modified, version, of, the, linux, kernel, and, other, open, source, software, designed, primarily, for, touchscreen, mobile, devices, such, as, smartphones, and, tablets, android, has, historically, been, developed, by, a, consortium, of, developers, known, as, the, open, handset, alliance, but, its, most, widely, used, version, is, primarily, developed, by, google, it, was, unveiled, in, november, 2007, with, the, first, commercial, android, device, the, htc, dream, being, launched, in, september, 2008, at, its, core, the, operating, system, is, known, as, the, android, open, source, project, aosp, and, is, free, and, open, source, software, foss, primarily, licensed, under, the, apache, license, however, most, devices, run, on, the, proprietary, android, version, developed, by, google, which, ships, with, additional, proprietary, closed, source, software, pre, installed, most, notably, google, mobile, services, gms, which, includes, core, apps, such, as, google, chrome, the, digital, distribution, platform, google, play, and, the, associated, google, play, services, development, platform, firebase, cloud, messaging, is, used, for, push, notifications, while, aosp, is, free, the, android, name, and, logo, are, trademarks, of, google, which, imposes, standards, to, restrict, the, use, of, android, branding, by, uncertified, devices, outside, their, ecosystem, over, 70, percent, of, smartphones, based, on, the, android, open, source, project, run, google, s, ecosystem, which, is, known, simply, as, android, some, with, vendor, customized, user, interfaces, and, software, suites, such, as, touchwiz, and, later, one, ui, by, samsung, and, htc, sense, competing, ecosystems, and, forks, of, aosp, include, fire, os, developed, by, amazon, coloros, by, oppo, originos, by, vivo, magicui, by, honor, and, custom, roms, such, as, lineageos, and, meta, horizon, os, for, vr, headsets, the, source, code, has, been, used, to, develop, variants, of, android, on, a, range, of, other, electronics, such, as, game, consoles, digital, cameras, portable, media, players, and, pcs, each, with, a, specialized, user, interface, some, well, known, derivatives, include, android, tv, for, televisions, and, wear, os, for, wearables, both, developed, by, google, software, packages, on, android, which, use, the, apk, format, are, generally, distributed, through, proprietary, application, stores, like, google, play, store, amazon, appstore, samsung, galaxy, store, huawei, appgallery, cafe, bazaar, getjar, and, aptoide, or, open, source, platforms, like, f, droid, android, has, been, the, best, selling, os, worldwide, on, smartphones, since, 2011, and, on, tablets, since, 2013, as, of, may, 2021, it, had, over, three, billion, monthly, active, users, the, largest, installed, base, of, any, operating, system, in, the, world, and, as, of, 2024, the, google, play, store, features, 1, 7, million, apps, a, decline, from, its, of, peak, of, over, 3, million, apps, android, 14, released, on, october, 4, 2023, is, the, latest, version, and, android, 12, 1, 12l, includes, improvements, specific, to, foldable, phones, tablets, desktop, sized, screens, and, chromebooks, android, inc, was, founded, in, palo, alto, california, in, october, 2003, by, andy, rubin, rich, miner, nick, sears, and, chris, white, rubin, described, the, android, project, as, having, tremendous, potential, in, developing, smarter, mobile, devices, that, are, more, aware, of, its, owner, s, location, and, preferences, the, early, intentions, of, the, company, were, to, develop, an, advanced, operating, system, for, digital, cameras, and, this, was, the, basis, of, its, pitch, to, investors, in, april, 2004, the, company, then, decided, that, the, market, for, cameras, was, not, large, enough, for, its, goals, and, five, months, later, it, had, diverted, its, efforts, and, was, pitching, android, as, a, handset, operating, system, that, would, rival, symbian, and, microsoft, windows, mobile, rubin, had, difficulty, attracting, investors, early, on, and, android, was, facing, eviction, from, its, office, space, steve, perlman, a, close, friend, of, rubin, brought, him, 10, 000, in, cash, in, an, envelope, and, shortly, thereafter, wired, an, undisclosed, amount, as, seed, funding, perlman, refused, a, stake, in, the, company, and, has, stated, i, did, it, because, i, believed, in, the, thing, and, i, wanted, to, help, andy, in, 2005, rubin, tried, to, negotiate, deals, with, samsung, and, htc, shortly, afterwards, google, acquired, the, company, in, july, of, that, year, for, at, least, 50, million, this, was, google, s, best, deal, ever, according, to, google, s, then, vice, president, of, corporate, development, david, lawee, in, 2010, android, s, key, employees, including, rubin, miner, sears, and, white, joined, google, as, part, of, the, acquisition, not, much, was, known, about, the, secretive, android, inc, at, the, time, with, the, company, having, provided, few, details, other, than, that, it, was, making, software, for, mobile, phones, at, google, the, team, led, by, rubin, developed, a, mobile, device, platform, powered, by, the, linux, kernel, google, marketed, the, platform, to, handset, makers, and, carriers, on, the, promise, of, providing, a, flexible, upgradeable, system, google, had, lined, up, a, series, of, hardware, components, and, software, partners, and, signaled, to, carriers, that, it, was, open, to, various, degrees, of, cooperation, speculation, about, google, s, intention, to, enter, the, mobile, communications, market, continued, to, build, through, december, 2006, an, early, prototype, had, a, close, resemblance, to, a, blackberry, phone, with, no, touchscreen, and, a, physical, qwerty, keyboard, but, the, arrival, of, 2007, s, apple, iphone, meant, that, android, had, to, go, back, to, the, drawing, board, google, later, changed, its, android, specification, documents, to, state, that, touchscreens, will, be, supported, although, the, product, was, designed, with, the, presence, of, discrete, physical, buttons, as, an, assumption, therefore, a, touchscreen, cannot, completely, replace, physical, buttons, by, 2008, both, nokia, and, blackberry, announced, touch, based, smartphones, to, rival, the, iphone, 3g, and, android, s, focus, eventually, switched, to, just, touchscreens, the, first, commercially, available, smartphone, running, android, was, the, htc, dream, also, known, as, t, mobile, g1, announced, on, september, 23, 2008, on, november, 5, 2007, the, open, handset, alliance, a, consortium, of, technology, companies, including, google, device, manufacturers, such, as, htc, motorola, and, samsung, wireless, carriers, such, as, sprint, and, t, mobile, and, chipset, makers, such, as, qualcomm, and, texas, instruments, unveiled, itself, with, a, goal, to, develop, the, first, truly, open, and, comprehensive, platform, for, mobile, devices, within, a, year, the, open, handset, alliance, faced, two, other, open, source, competitors, the, symbian, foundation, and, the, limo, foundation, the, latter, also, developing, a, linux, based, mobile, operating, system, like, google, in, september, 2007, informationweek, covered, an, evalueserve, study, reporting, that, google, had, filed, several, patent, applications, in, the, area, of, mobile, telephony, on, september, 23, 2008, android, was, introduced, by, andy, rubin, larry, page, sergey, brin, cole, brodman, christopher, schlaeffer, and, peter, chou, at, a, press, conference, in, a, new, york, city, subway, station, since, 2008, android, has, seen, numerous, updates, which, have, incrementally, improved, the, operating, system, adding, new, features, and, fixing, bugs, in, previous, releases, each, major, release, is, named, in, alphabetical, order, after, a, dessert, or, sugary, treat, with, the, first, few, android, versions, being, called, cupcake, donut, eclair, and, froyo, in, that, order, during, its, announcement, of, android, kitkat, in, 2013, google, explained, that, since, these, devices, make, our, lives, so, sweet, each, android, version, is, named, after, a, dessert, although, a, google, spokesperson, told, cnn, in, an, interview, that, it, s, kind, of, like, an, internal, team, thing, and, we, prefer, to, be, a, little, bit, how, should, i, say, a, bit, inscrutable, in, the, matter, i, ll, say, in, 2010, google, launched, its, nexus, series, of, devices, a, lineup, in, which, google, partnered, with, different, device, manufacturers, to, produce, new, devices, and, introduce, new, android, versions, the, series, was, described, as, having, played, a, pivotal, role, in, android, s, history, by, introducing, new, software, iterations, and, hardware, standards, across, the, board, and, became, known, for, its, bloat, free, software, with, timely, updates, at, its, developer, conference, in, may, 2013, google, announced, a, special, version, of, the, samsung, galaxy, s4, where, instead, of, using, samsung, s, own, android, customization, the, phone, ran, stock,

including, the, htc, one, google, play, edition, and, moto, g, google, play, edition, in, 2015, ars, technica, wrote, that, earlier, this, week, the, last, of, the, google, play, edition, android, phones, in, google, s, online, storefront, were, listed, as, no, longer, available, for, sale, and, that, now, they, re, all, gone, and, it, looks, a, whole, lot, like, the, program, has, wrapped, up, from, 2008, to, 2013, hugo, barra, served, as, product, spokesperson, representing, android, at, press, conferences, and, google, i, o, google, s, annual, developer, focused, conference, he, left, google, in, august, 2013, to, join, chinese, phone, maker, xiaomi, less, than, six, months, earlier, google, s, then, ceo, larry, page, announced, in, a, blog, post, that, andy, rubin, had, moved,

devices, and, must, be, 64, bit, are, written, using, the, android, software, development, kit, sdk, and, often, kotlin, programming, language, which, replaced, java, as, google, s, preferred, language, for, android, app, development, in, may, 2019, and, was, originally, announced, in, may, 2017, java, is, still, supported, originally, the, only, option, for, user, space, programs, and, is, often, mixed, with, kotlin, as, is, c, java, or, other, jvm, languages, such, as, kotlin, may, be, combined, with, c, c, together, with, a, choice, of, non, default, runtimes, that, allow, better, c, support, the, sdk, includes, a, comprehensive, set, of, development, tools, including, a, debugger, software, libraries, a, handset, emulator, based, on, qemu, documentation, sample, code, and, tutorials, initially, google, s, supported, integrated, development, environment, ide, was, eclipse, using, the, android, development, tools, adt, plugin, in, december, 2014, google, released, android, studio, based, on, intellij, idea, as, its, primary, ide, for, android, application, development, other, development, tools, are, available, including, a, native, development, kit, ndk, for, applications, or, extensions, in, c, or, c, google, app, inventor, a, visual, environment, for, novice, programmers, and, various, cross, platform, mobile, web, applications, frameworks, in, january, 2014, google, unveiled, a, framework, based, on, apache, cordova, for, porting, chrome, html, 5, web, applications, to, android, wrapped, in, a, native, application, shell, additionally, firebase, was, acquired, by, google, in, 2014, that, provides, helpful, tools, for, app, and, web, developers, android, has, a, growing, selection, of, third, party, applications, which, can, be, acquired, by, users, by, downloading, and, installing, the, application, s, apk, android, application, package, file, or, by, downloading, them, using, an, application, store, program, that, allows, users, to, install, update, and, remove, applications, from, their, devices, google, play, store, is, the, primary, application, store, installed, on, android, devices, that, comply, with, google, s,

third, party, developers, as, of, january, 2021, there, are, more, than, three, million, applications, available, for, android, in, play, store, as, of, july, 2013, 50, billion, application, installations, had, been, performed, some, carriers, offer, direct, carrier, billing, for, google, play, application, purchases, where, the, cost, of, the, application, is, added, to, the, user, s, monthly, bill, as, of, may, 2017, there, are, over, one, billion, active, users, a, month, for, gmail, android, chrome, google, play, and, maps, due, to, the, open, nature, of, android, a, number, of, third, party, application, marketplaces, also, exist, for, android, either, to, provide, a, substitute, for, devices, that, are, not, allowed, to, ship, with, google, play, store, provide, applications, that, cannot, be, offered, on, google, play, store, due, to, policy, violations, or, for, other, reasons, examples, of, these, third, party, stores, have, included, the, amazon, appstore, getjar, and, slideme, f, droid, another, alternative, marketplace, seeks, to, only, provide, applications, that, are, distributed, under, free, and, open, source, licenses, in, october, 2020, google, removed, several, android, applications, from, play, store, as, they, were, identified, breaching, its, data, collection, rules, the, firm, was, informed, by, international, digital, accountability, council, idac, that, apps, for, children, like, number, coloring, princess, salon, and, cats, cosplay, with, collective, downloads, of, 20, million, were, violating, google, s, policies, at, the, windows, 11, announcement, event, in, june, 2021, microsoft, showcased, the, new, windows, subsystem, for, android, wsa, to, enable, support, for, the, android, open, source, project, aosp, but, it, has, since, been, deprecated, it, was, meant, to, allow, users, running, android, apps, and, games, in, windows, 11, on, their, windows, desktop, on, march, 5, 2024, microsoft, announced, deprecation, of, wsa, with, support, ending, on, march, 5, 2025, the, storage, of, android, devices, can, be, expanded, using, secondary, devices, such, as, sd, cards, android, recognizes, two, types, of, secondary, storage, portable, storage, which, is, used, by, default, and, adoptable, storage, portable, storage, is, treated, as, an, external, storage, device, adoptable, storage, introduced, on, android, 6, 0, allows, the, internal, storage, of, the, device, to, be, spanned, with, the, sd, card, treating, it, as, an, extension, of, the, internal, storage, this, has, the, disadvantage, of, preventing, the, memory, card, from, being, used, with, another, device, unless, it, is, reformatted, android, 4, 4, introduced, the, storage, access, framework, saf, a, set, of, apis, for, accessing, files, on, the, device, s, filesystem, as, of, android, 11, android, has, required, apps, to, conform, to, a, data, privacy, policy, known, as, scoped, storage, under, which, apps, may, only, automatically, have, access, to, certain, directories, such, as, those, for, pictures, music, and, video, and, app, specific, directories, they, have, created, themselves, apps, are, required, to, use, the, saf, to, access, any, other, part, of, the, filesystem, since, android, devices, are, usually, battery, powered, android, is, designed, to, manage, processes, to, keep, power, consumption, at, a, minimum, when, an, application, is, not, in, use, the, system, suspends, its, operation, so, that, while, available, for, immediate, use, rather, than, closed, it, does, not, use, battery, power, or, cpu, resources, android, manages, the, applications, stored, in, memory, automatically, when, memory, is, low, the, system, will, begin, invisibly, and, automatically, closing, inactive, processes, starting, with, those, that, have, been, inactive, for, the, longest, amount, of, time, lifehacker, reported, in, 2011, that, third, party, task, killer, applications, were, doing, more, harm, than, good, some, settings, for, use, by, developers, for, debugging, and, power, users, are, located, in, a, developer, options, sub, menu, such, as, the, ability, to, highlight, updating, parts, of, the, display, show, an, overlay, with, the, current, status, of, the, touch, screen, show, touching, spots, for, possible, use, in, screencasting, notify, the, user, of,

official, support, since, 2012, android, devices, with, intel, processors, began, to, appear, including, phones, and, tablets, while, gaining, support, for, 64, bit, platforms, android, was, first, made, to, run, on, 64, bit, x86, and, then, on, arm64, an, unofficial, experimental, port, of, the, operating, system, to, the, risc, v, architecture, was, released, in, 2021, requirements, for, the,

versions, of, opengl, es, and, vulkan, and, version, 1, 1, available, for, some, devices, android, devices, incorporate, many, optional, hardware, components, including, still, or, video, cameras, gps, orientation, sensors, dedicated, gaming, controls, accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, magnetometers, proximity, sensors, pressure, sensors, thermometers, and, touchscreens, some, hardware, components, are, not, required, but, became, standard, in, certain, classes, of, devices, such, as, smartphones, and, additional, requirements, apply, if, they, are, present, some, other, hardware, was, initially, required, but, those, requirements, have, been, relaxed, or, eliminated, altogether, for, example, as, android, was, developed, initially, as, a, phone, os, hardware, such, as, microphones, were, required, while, over, time, the, phone, function, became, optional, android, used, to, require, an, autofocus, camera, which, was, relaxed, to, a, fixed, focus, camera, if, present, at, all, since, the, camera, was, dropped, as, a, requirement, entirely, when, android, started, to, be, used, on, set, top, boxes, in, addition, to, running, on, smartphones, and, tablets, several, vendors, run, android, natively, on, regular, pc, hardware, with, a, keyboard, and, mouse, in, addition, to, their, availability, on, commercially, available, hardware, similar, pc, hardware, friendly, versions, of, android, are, freely, available, from, the, android, x86, project, including, customized, android, 4, 4, using, the, android, emulator, that, is, part, of, the, android, sdk, or, third, party, emulators, android, can, also, run, non, natively, on, x86, architectures, chinese, companies, are, building, a, pc, and, mobile, operating, system, based, on, android, to, compete, directly, with, microsoft, windows, and, google, android, the, chinese, academy, of, engineering, noted, that, more, than, a, dozen, companies, were, customizing, android, following, a, chinese, ban, on, the, use, of, windows, 8, on, government, pcs, android, is, developed, by, google, until, the, latest, changes, and, updates, are, ready, to, be, released, at, which, point, the, source, code, is, made, available, to, the, android, open, source, project, aosp, an, open, source, initiative, led, by, google, the, first, source, code, release, happened, as, part, of, the, initial, release, in, 2007, all, releases, are, under, the, apache, license, the, aosp, code, can, be, found, with, minimal, modifications, on, select, devices, mainly, the, former, nexus, and, current, android, one, series, of, devices, however, most, original, equipment, manufacturers, oems, customize, the, source, code, to, run, on, their, hardware, android, s, source, code, does, not, contain, the, device, drivers, often, proprietary, that, are, needed, for, certain, hardware, components, and, does, not, contain, the, source, code, of, google, play, services, which, many, apps, depend, on, as, a, result, most, android, devices, including, google, s, own, ship, with, a, combination, of, free, and, open, source, and, proprietary, software, with, the, software, required, for, accessing, google, services, falling, into, the, latter, category, in, response, to, this, there, are, some, projects, that, build, complete, operating, systems, based, on, aosp, as, free, software, the, first, being, cyanogenmod, see, section, open, source, community, below, google, provides, annual, android, releases, both, for, factory, installation, in, new, devices, and, for, over, the, air, updates, to, existing, devices, the, latest, major, release, is, android, 14, the, extensive, variation, of, hardware, in, android, devices, has, caused, significant, delays, for, software, upgrades, and, security, patches, each, upgrade, has, had, to, be, specifically, tailored, a, time, and, resource, consuming, process, except, for, devices, within, the, google, nexus, and, pixel, brands, updates, have, often, arrived, months, after, the, release, of, the, new, version, or, not, at, all, manufacturers, often, prioritize, their, newest, devices, and, leave, old, ones, behind, additional, delays, can, be, introduced, by, wireless, carriers, who, after, receiving, updates, from, manufacturers, further, customize, android, to, their, needs, and, conduct, extensive, testing, on, their, networks, before, sending, out, the, upgrade, there, are, also, situations, in, which, upgrades, are, impossible, due, to, a, manufacturer, not, updating, necessary, drivers, the, lack, of, after, sale, support, from, manufacturers, and, carriers, has, been, widely, criticized, by, consumer, groups, and, the, technology, media, some, commentators, have, noted, that, the, industry, has, a, financial, incentive, not, to, upgrade, their, devices, as, the, lack, of, updates, for, existing, devices, fuels, the, purchase, of, newer, ones, an, attitude, described, as, insulting, the, guardian, complained, that, the, method, of, distribution, for, updates, is, complicated, only, because, manufacturers, and, carriers, have, designed, it, that, way, in, 2011, google, partnered, with, a, number, of, industry, players, to, announce, an, android, update, alliance, pledging, to, deliver, timely, updates, for, every, device, for, 18, months, after, its, release, however, there, has, not, been, another, official, word, about, that, alliance, since, its, announcement, in, 2012, google, began, de, coupling, certain, aspects, of, the, operating, system, particularly, its, central, applications, so, they, could, be, updated, through, the, google, play, store, independently, of, the, os, one, of, those, components, google, play, services, is, a, closed, source, system, level, process, providing, apis, for, google, services, installed, automatically, on, nearly, all, devices, running, android, 2, 2, froyo, and, higher, with, these, changes, google, can, add, new, system, functions, and, update, apps, without, having, to, distribute, an, upgrade, to, the, operating, system, itself, as, a, result, android, 4, 2, and, 4, 3, jelly, bean, contained, relatively, fewer, user, facing, changes, focusing, more, on, minor, changes, and, platform, improvements, htc, s, then, executive, jason, mackenzie, called, monthly, security, updates, unrealistic, in, 2015, and, google, was, trying, to, persuade, carriers, to, exclude, security, patches, from, the, full, testing, procedures, in, may, 2016, bloomberg, businessweek, reported, that, google, was, making, efforts, to, keep, android, more, up, to, date, including, accelerated, rates, of, security, updates, rolling, out, technological, workarounds, reducing, requirements, for, phone, testing, and, ranking, phone, makers, in, an, attempt, to, shame, them, into, better, behavior, as, stated, by, bloomberg, as, smartphones, get, more, capable, complex, and, hackable, having, the, latest, software, work, closely, with, the, hardware, is, increasingly, important, hiroshi, lockheimer, the, android, lead, admitted, that, it, s, not, an, ideal, situation, further, commenting, that, the, lack, of, updates, is, the, weakest, link, on, security, on, android, wireless, carriers, were, described, in, the, report, as, the, most, challenging, discussions, due, to, their, slow, approval, time, while, testing, on, their, networks, despite, some, carriers, including, verizon, wireless, and, sprint, corporation, already, shortening, their, approval, times, in, a, further, effort, for, persuasion, google, shared, a, list, of, top, phone, makers, measured, by, updated, devices, with, its, android, partners, and, is, considering, making, the, list, public, mike, chan, co, founder, of, phone, maker, nextbit, and, former, android, developer, said, that, the, best, way, to, solve, this, problem, is, a, massive, re, architecture, of, the, operating, system, or, google, could, invest, in, training, manufacturers, and, carriers, to, be, good, android, citizens, in, may, 2017, with, the, announcement, of, android, 8, 0, google, introduced, project, treble, a, major, re, architect, of, the, android, os, framework, designed, to, make, it, easier, faster, and, less, costly, for, manufacturers, to, update, devices, to, newer, versions, of, android, project, treble, separates, the, vendor, implementation, device, specific, lower, level, software, written, by, silicon, manufacturers, from, the, android, os, framework, via, a, new, vendor, interface, in, android, 7, 0, and, earlier, no, formal, vendor, interface, exists, so, device, makers, must, update, large, portions, of, the, android, code, to, move, a, device, to, a, newer, version, of, the, operating, system, with, treble, the, new, stable, vendor, interface, provides, access, to, the, hardware, specific, parts, of, android, enabling, device, makers, to, deliver, new, android, releases, simply, by, updating, the, android, os, framework, without, any, additional, work, required, from, the, silicon, manufacturers, in, september, 2017, google, s, project, treble, team, revealed, that, as, part, of, their, efforts, to, improve, the, security, lifecycle, of, android, devices, google, had, managed, to, get, the, linux, foundation, to, agree, to, extend, the, support, lifecycle, of, the, linux, long, term, support, lts, kernel, branch, from, the, 2, years, that, it, has, historically, lasted, to, 6, years, for, future, versions, of, the, lts, kernel, starting, with, linux, kernel, 4, 4, in, may, 2019, with, the, announcement, of, android, 10, google, introduced, project, mainline, to, simplify, and, expedite, delivery, of, updates, to, the, android, ecosystem, project, mainline, enables, updates, to, core, os, components, through, the, google, play, store, as, a, result, important, security, and, performance, improvements, that, previously, needed, to, be, part, of, full, os, updates, can, be, downloaded, and, installed, as, easily, as, an, app, update, google, reported, rolling, out, new, amendments, in, android, 12, aimed, at, making, the, use, of, third, party, application, stores, easier, this, announcement, rectified, the, concerns, reported, regarding, the, development, of, android, apps, including, a, fight, over, an, alternative, in, app, payment, system, and, difficulties, faced, by, businesses, moving, online, because, of, covid, 19, android, s, kernel, is, based, on, the, linux, kernel, s, long, term, support, lts, branches, as, of, 2024, android, 14, uses, versions, 6, 1, or, 5, 15, for, feature, kernels, can, be, older, for, launch, kernels, e, g, android12, 5, 10, android11, 5, 4, depending, on, android, version, down, to, e, g, android11, 5, 4, android, 4, 14, stable, android, 4, 9, q, and, older, android, versions, use, version, 5, 15, or, a, number, of, older, kernels, the, actual, kernel, depends, on, the, individual, device, android, s, variant, of, the, linux, kernel, has, further, architectural, changes, that, are, implemented, by, google, outside, the, typical, linux, kernel, development, cycle, such, as, the, inclusion, of, components, like, device, trees, ashmem, ion, and, different, out, of, memory, oom, handling, certain, features, that, google, contributed, back, to, the, linux, kernel, notably, a, power, management, feature, called, wakelocks, were, initially, rejected, by, mainline, kernel, developers, partly, because, they, felt, that, google, did, not, show, any, intent, to, maintain, its, own, code, google, announced, in, april, 2010, that, they, would, hire, two, employees, to, work, with, the, linux, kernel, community, but, greg, kroah, hartman, the, current, linux, kernel, maintainer, for, the, stable, branch, said, in, december, 2010, that, he, was, concerned, that, google, was, no, longer, trying, to, get, their, code, changes, included, in, mainstream, linux, google, engineer, patrick, brady, once, stated, in, the, company, s, developer, conference, that, android, is, not, linux, with, computerworld, adding, that, let, me, make, it, simple, for, you, without, linux, there, is, no, android, ars, technica, wrote, that, although, android, is, built, on, top, of, the, linux, kernel, the, platform, has, very, little, in, common, with, the, conventional, desktop, linux, stack, in, august, 2011, linus, torvalds, said, that, eventually, android, and, linux, would, come, back, to, a, common, kernel, but, it, will, probably, not, be, for, four, to, five, years, that, has, not, happened, yet, while, some, code, has, been, upstreamed, not, all, of, it, has, so, modified, kernels, keep, being, used, in, december, 2011, greg, kroah, hartman, announced, the, start, of, android, mainlining, project, which, aims, to, put, some, android, drivers, patches, and, features, back, into, the, linux, kernel, starting, in, linux, 3, 3, linux, included, the, autosleep, and, wakelocks, capabilities, in, the, 3, 5, kernel, after, many, previous, attempts, at, a, merger, the, interfaces, are, the, same, but, the, upstream, linux, implementation, allows, for, two, different, suspend, modes, to, memory, the, traditional, suspend, that, android, uses, and, to, disk, hibernate, as, it, is, known, on, the, desktop, google, maintains, a, public, code, repository, that, contains, their, experimental, work, to, re, base, android, off, the, latest, stable, linux, versions, android, is, a, linux, distribution, according, to, the, linux, foundation, google, s, open, source, chief, chris, dibona, and, several, journalists, others, such, as, google, engineer, patrick, brady, say, that, android, is, not, linux, in, the, traditional, unix, like, linux, distribution, sense, android, does, not, include, the, gnu, c, library, it, uses, bionic, as, an, alternative, c, library, and, some, other, components, typically, found, in, linux, distributions, with, the, release, of, android, oreo, in, 2017, google, began, to, require, that, devices, shipped, with, new, socs, had, linux, kernel, version, 4, 4, or, newer, for, security, reasons, existing, devices, upgraded, to, oreo, and, new, products, launched, with, older, socs, were, exempt, from, this, rule, the, flash, storage, on, android, devices, is, split, into, several, partitions, such, as, system, for, the, operating, system, itself, and, data, for, user, data, and, application, installations, in, contrast, to, typical, desktop, linux, distributions, android, device, owners, are, not, given, root, access, to, the, operating, system, and, sensitive, partitions, such, as, system, are, partially, read, only, however, root, access, can, be, obtained, by, exploiting, security, flaws, in, android, which, is, used, frequently, by, the, open, source, community, to, enhance, the, capabilities, and, customizability, of, their, devices, but, also, by, malicious, parties, to, install, viruses, and, malware, root, access, can, also, be, obtained, by, unlocking, the, bootloader, which, is, available, on, most, android, devices, for, example, on, most, google, pixel, oneplus, and, nothing, models, oem, unlocking, option, in, the, developer, settings, allows, fastboot, to, unlock, the, bootloader, but, most, oems, have, their, own, methods, the, unlocking, process, resets, the, system, to, factory, state, erasing, all, user, data, on, top, of, the, linux, kernel, there, are, the, middleware, libraries, and, apis, written, in, c, and, application, software, running, on, an, application, framework, which, includes, java, compatible, libraries, development, of, the, linux, kernel, continues, independently, of, android, s, other, source, code, projects, android, uses, android, runtime, art, as, its, runtime, environment, introduced, in, version, 4, 4, which, uses, ahead, of, time, aot, compilation, to, entirely, compile, the, application, bytecode, into, machine, code, upon, the, installation, of, an, application, in, android, 4, 4, art, was, an, experimental, feature, and, not, enabled, by, default, it, became, the, only, runtime, option, in, the, next, major, version, of, android, 5, 0, in, versions, no, longer, supported, until, version, 5, 0, when, art, took, over, android, previously, used, dalvik, as, a, process, virtual, machine, with, trace, based, just, in, time, jit, compilation, to, run, dalvik, dex, code, dalvik, executable, which, is, usually, translated, from, the, java, bytecode, following, the, trace, based, jit, principle, in, addition, to, interpreting, the, majority, of, application, code, dalvik, performs, the, compilation, and, native, execution, of, select, frequently, executed, code, segments, traces, each, time, an, application, is, launched, for, its, java, library, the, android, platform, uses, a, subset, of, the, now, discontinued, apache, harmony, project, in, december, 2015, google, announced, that, the, next, version, of, android, would, switch, to, a, java, implementation, based, on, the, openjdk, project, android, s, standard, c, library, bionic, was, developed, by, google, specifically, for, android, as, a, derivation, of, the, bsd, s, standard, c, library, code, bionic, itself, has, been, designed, with, several, major, features, specific, to, the, linux, kernel, the, main, benefits, of, using, bionic, instead, of, the, gnu, c, library, glibc, or, uclibc, are, its, smaller, runtime, footprint, and, optimization, for, low, frequency, cpus, at, the, same, time, bionic, is, licensed, under, the, terms, of, the, bsd, licence, which, google, finds, more, suitable, for, the, android, s, overall, licensing, model, aiming, for, a, different, licensing, model, toward, the, end, of, 2012, google, switched, the, bluetooth, stack, in, android, from, the, gpl, licensed, bluez, to, the, apache, licensed, bluedroid, a, new, bluetooth, stack, called, gabeldorsche, was, developed, to, try, to, fix, the, bugs, in, the, bluedroid, implementation, android, does, not, have, a, native, x, window, system, by, default, nor, does, it, support, the, full, set, of, standard, gnu, libraries, this, made, it, difficult, to, port, existing, linux, applications, or, libraries, to, android, until, version, r5, of, the, android, native, development, kit, brought, support, for, applications, written, completely, in, c, or, c, libraries, written, in, c, may, also, be, used, in, applications, by, injection, of, a, small, shim, and, usage, of, the, jni, in, current, versions, of, android, toybox, a, collection, of, command, line, utilities, mostly, for, use, by, apps, as, android, does, not, provide, a, command, line, interface, by, default, is, used, since, the, release, of, marshmallow, replacing, a, similar, toolbox, collection, found, in, previous, android, versions, android, has, another, operating, system, trusty, os, within, it, as, a, part, of, trusty, software, components, supporting, a, trusted, execution, environment, tee, on, mobile, devices, trusty, and, the, trusty, api, are, subject, to, change, applications, for, the, trusty, os, can, be, written, in, c, c, c, support, is, limited, and, they, have, access, to, a, small, c, library, all, trusty, applications, are, single, threaded, multithreading, in, trusty, userspace, currently, is, unsupported, third, party, application, development, is, not, supported, in, the, current, version, and, software, running, on, the, os, and, processor, for, it, run, the, drm, framework, for, protected, content, there, are, many, other, uses, for, a, tee, such, as, mobile, payments, secure, banking, full, disk, encryption, multi, factor, authentication, device, reset, protection, replay, protected, persistent, storage, wireless, display, cast, of, protected, content, secure, pin, and, fingerprint, processing, and, even, malware, detection, android, s, source, code, is, released, by, google, under, an, open, source, license, and, its, open, nature, has, encouraged, a, large, community, of, developers, and, enthusiasts, to, use, the, open, source, code, as, a, foundation, for, community, driven, projects, which, deliver, updates, to, older, devices, add, new, features, for, advanced, users, or, bring, android, to, devices, originally, shipped, with, other, operating, systems, these, community, developed, releases, often, bring, new, features, and, updates, to, devices, faster, than, through, the, official, manufacturer, carrier, channels, with, a, comparable, level, of, quality, provide, continued, support, for, older, devices, that, no, longer, receive, official, updates, or, bring, android, to, devices, that, were, officially, released, running, other, operating, systems, such, as, the, hp, touchpad, community, releases, often, come, pre, rooted, and, contain, modifications, not, provided, by, the, original, vendor, such, as, the, ability, to, overclock, or, over, undervolt, the, device, s, processor, cyanogenmod, was, the, most, widely, used, community, firmware, now, discontinued, and, succeeded, by, lineageos, there, are, as, of, august, 2019, a, handful, of, notable, custom, android, distributions, roms, of, android, version, 9, 0, pie, which, was, released, publicly, in, august, 2018, see, list, of, custom, android, distributions, historically, device, manufacturers, and, mobile, carriers, have, typically, been, unsupportive, of, third, party, firmware, development, manufacturers, express, concern, about, improper, functioning, of, devices, running, unofficial, software, and, the, support, costs, resulting, from, this, moreover, modified, firmware, such, as, cyanogenmod, sometimes, offer, features, such, as, tethering, for, which, carriers, would, otherwise, charge, a, premium, as, a, result, technical, obstacles, including, locked, bootloaders, and, restricted, access, to, root, permissions, are, common, in, many, devices, however, as, community, developed, software, has, grown, more, popular, and, following, a, statement, by, the, librarian, of, congress, in, the, united, states, that, permits, the, jailbreaking, of, mobile, devices, manufacturers, and, carriers, have, softened, their, position, regarding, third, party, development, with, some, including, htc, motorola, samsung, and, sony, providing, support, and, encouraging, development, as, a, result, of, this, over, time, the, need, to, circumvent, hardware, restrictions, to, install, unofficial, firmware, has, lessened, as, an, increasing, number, of, devices, are, shipped, with, unlocked, or, unlockable, bootloaders, similar, to, nexus, series, of, phones, although, usually, requiring, that, users, waive, their, devices, warranties, to, do, so, however, despite, manufacturer, acceptance, some, carriers, in, the, us, still, require, that, phones, are, locked, down, internally, android, identifies, each, supported, device, by, its, device, codename, a, short, string, which, may, or, may, not, be, similar, to, the, model, name, used, in, marketing, the, device, for, example, the, device, codename, of, the, pixel, smartphone, is, sailfish, the, device, codename, is, usually, not, visible, to, the, end, user, but, is, important, for, determining, compatibility, with, modified, android, versions, it, is, sometimes, also, mentioned, in, articles, discussing, a, device, because, it, allows, to, distinguish, different, hardware, variants, of, a, device, even, if, the, manufacturer, offers, them, under, the, same, name, the, device, codename, is, available, to, running, applications, under, android, os, build, device, in, 2020, google, launched, the, android, partner, vulnerability, initiative, to, improve, the, security, of, android, they, also, formed, an, android, security, team, research, from, security, company, trend, micro, lists, premium, service, abuse, as, the, most, common, type, of, android, malware, where, text, messages, are, sent, from, infected, phones, to, premium, rate, telephone, numbers, without, the, consent, or, even, knowledge, of, the, user, other, malware, displays, unwanted, and, intrusive, advertisements, on, the, device, or, sends, personal, information, to, unauthorised, third, parties, security, threats, on, android, are, reportedly, growing, exponentially, however, google, engineers, have, argued, that, the, malware, and, virus, threat, on, android, is, being, exaggerated, by, security, companies, for, commercial, reasons, and, have, accused, the, security, industry, of, playing, on, fears, to, sell, virus, protection, software, to, users, google, maintains, that, dangerous, malware, is, actually, extremely, rare, and, a, survey, conducted, by, f, secure, showed, that, only, 0, 5, of, android, malware, reported, had, come, from, the, google, play, store, in, 2021, journalists, and, researchers, reported, the, discovery, of, spyware, called, pegasus, developed, and, distributed, by, a, private, company, which, can, and, has, been, used, to, infect, both, ios, and, android, smartphones, often, partly, via, use, of, 0, day, exploits, without, the, need, for, any, user, interaction, or, significant, clues, to, the, user, and, then, be, used, to, exfiltrate, data, track, user, locations, capture, film, through, its, camera, and, activate, the, microphone, at, any, time, analysis, of, data, traffic, by, popular, smartphones, running, variants, of, android, found, substantial, by, default, data, collection, and, sharing, with, no, opt, out, by, this, pre, installed, software, both, of, these, issues, are, not, addressed, or, cannot, be, addressed, by, security, patches, as, part, of, the, broader, 2013, mass, surveillance, disclosures, it, was, revealed, in, september, 2013, that, the, american, and, british, intelligence, agencies, the, national, security, agency, nsa, and, government, communications, headquarters, gchq, respectively, have, access, to, the, user, data, on, iphone, blackberry, and, android, devices, they, are, reportedly, able, to, read, almost, all, smartphone, information, including, sms, location, emails, and, notes, in, january, 2014, further, reports, revealed, the, intelligence, agencies, capabilities, to, intercept, the, personal, information, transmitted, across, the, internet, by, social, networks, and, other, popular, applications, such, as, angry, birds, which, collect, personal, information, of, their, users, for, advertising, and, other, commercial, reasons, gchq, has, according, to, the, guardian, a, wiki, style, guide, of, different, apps, and, advertising, networks, and, the, different, data, that, can, be, siphoned, from, each, later, that, week, the, finnish, angry, birds, developer, rovio, announced, that, it, was, reconsidering, its, relationships, with, its, advertising, platforms, in, the, light, of, these, revelations, and, called, upon, the, wider, industry, to, do, the, same, the, documents, revealed, a, further, effort, by, the, intelligence, agencies, to, intercept, google, maps, searches, and, queries, submitted, from, android, and, other, smartphones, to, collect, location, information, in, bulk, the, nsa, and, gchq, insist, their, activities, comply, with, all, relevant, domestic, and, international, laws, although, the, guardian, stated, the, latest, disclosures, could, also, add, to, mounting, public, concern, about, how, the, technology, sector, collects, and, uses, information, especially, for, those, outside, the, us, who, enjoy, fewer, privacy, protections, than, americans, leaked, documents, codenamed, vault, 7, and, dated, from, 2013, to, 2016, detail, the, capabilities, of, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, to, perform, electronic, surveillance, and, cyber, warfare, including, the, ability, to, compromise, the, operating, systems, of, most, smartphones, including, android, in, august, 2015, google, announced, that, devices, in, the, google, nexus, series, would, begin, to, receive, monthly, security, patches, google, also, wrote, that, nexus, devices, will, continue, to, receive, major, updates, for, at, least, two, years, and, security, patches, for, the, longer, of, three, years, from, initial, availability, or, 18, months, from, last, sale, of, the, device, via, the, google, store, the, following, october, researchers, at, the, university, of, cambridge, concluded, that, 87, 7, of, android, phones, in, use, had, known, but, unpatched, security, vulnerabilities, due, to, lack, of, updates, and, support, ron, amadeo, of, ars, technica, wrote, also, in, august, 2015, that, android, was, originally, designed, above, all, else, to, be, widely, adopted, google, was, starting, from, scratch, with, zero, percent, market, share, so, it, was, happy, to, give, up, control, and, give, everyone, a, seat, at, the, table, in, exchange, for, adoption, now, though, android, has, around, 75, 80, percent, of, the, worldwide, smartphone, market, making, it, not, just, the, world, s, most, popular, mobile, operating, system, but, arguably, the, most, popular, operating, system, period, as, such, security, has, become, a, big, issue, android, still, uses, a, software, update, chain, of, command, designed, back, when, the, android, ecosystem, had, zero, devices, to, update, and, it, just, doesn, t, work, following, news, of, google, s, monthly, schedule, some, manufacturers, including, samsung, and, lg, promised, to, issue, monthly, security, updates, but, as, noted, by, jerry, hildenbrand, in, android, central, in, february, 2016, instead, we, got, a, few, updates, on, specific, versions, of, a, small, handful, of, models, and, a, bunch, of, broken, promises, in, a, march, 2017, post, on, google, s, security, blog, android, security, leads, adrian, ludwig, and, mel, miller, wrote, that, more, than, 735, million, devices, from, 200, manufacturers, received, a, platform, security, update, in, 2016, and, that, our, carrier, and, hardware, partners, helped, expand, deployment, of, these, updates, releasing, updates, for, over, half, of, the, top, 50, devices, worldwide, in, the, last, quarter, of, 2016, they, also, wrote, that, about, half, of, devices, in, use, at, the, end, of, 2016, had, not, received, a, platform, security, update, in, the, previous, year, stating, that, their, work, would, continue, to, focus, on, streamlining, the, security, updates, program, for, easier, deployment, by, manufacturers, furthermore, in, a, comment, to, techcrunch, ludwig, stated, that, the, wait, time, for, security, updates, had, been, reduced, from, six, to, nine, weeks, down, to, just, a, few, days, with, 78, of, flagship, devices, in, north, america, being, up, to, date, on, security, at, the, end, of, 2016, patches, to, bugs, found, in, the, core, operating, system, often, do, not, reach, users, of, older, and, lower, priced, devices, however, the, open, source, nature, of, android, allows, security, contractors, to, take, existing, devices, and, adapt, them, for, highly, secure, uses, for, example, samsung, has, worked, with, general, dynamics, through, their, open, kernel, labs, acquisition, to, rebuild, jelly, bean, on, top, of, their, hardened, microvisor, for, the, knox, project, android, smartphones, have, the, ability, to, report, the, location, of, wi, fi, access, points, encountered, as, phone, users, move, around, to, build, databases, containing, the, physical, locations, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, such, access, points, these, databases, form, electronic, maps, to, locate, smartphones, allowing, them, to, run, apps, like, foursquare, google, latitude, facebook, places, and, to, deliver, location, based, ads, third, party, monitoring, software, such, as, taintdroid, an, academic, research, funded, project, can, in, some, cases, detect, when, personal, information, is, being, sent, from, applications, to, remote, servers, in, 2018, norwegian, security, firm, promon, has, unearthed, a, serious, android, security, hole, which, can, be, exploited, to, steal, login, credentials, access, messages, and, track, location, which, could, be, found, in, all, versions, of, android, including, android, 10, the, vulnerability, came, by, exploiting, a, bug, in, the, multitasking, system, enabling, a, malicious, app, to, overlay, legitimate, apps, with, fake, login, screens, that, users, are, not, aware, of, when, handing, in, security, credentials, users, can, also, be, tricked, into, granting, additional, permissions, to, the, malicious, apps, which, later, enable, them, to, perform, various, nefarious, activities, including, intercepting, texts, or, calls, and, stealing, banking, credentials, avast, threat, labs, also, discovered, that, many, pre, installed, apps, on, several, hundred, new, android, devices, contain, dangerous, malware, and, adware, some, of, the, preinstalled, malware, can, commit, ad, fraud, or, even, take, over, its, host, device, in, 2020, the, which, watchdog, reported, that, more, than, a, billion, android, devices, released, in, 2012, or, earlier, which, was, 40, of, android, devices, worldwide, were, at, risk, of, being, hacked, this, conclusion, stemmed, from, the, fact, that, no, security, updates, were, issued, for, the, android, versions, below, 7, 0, in, 2019, which, collaborated, with, the, av, comparatives, anti, virus, lab, to, infect, five, phone, models, with, malware, and, it, succeeded, in, each, case, google, refused, to, comment, on, the, watchdog, s, speculations, on, august, 5, 2020, twitter, published, a, blog, urging, its, users, to, update, their, applications, to, the, latest, version, with, regards, to, a, security, concern, that, allowed, others, to, access, direct, messages, a, hacker, could, easily, use, the, android, system, permissions, to, fetch, the, account, credentials, in, order, to, do, so, the, security, issue, is, only, with, android, 8, android, oreo, and, android, 9, android, pie, twitter, confirmed, that, updating, the, app, will, restrict, such, practices, android, applications, run, in, a, sandbox, an, isolated, area, of, the, system, that, does, not, have, access, to, the, rest, of, the, system, s, resources, unless, access, permissions, are, explicitly, granted, by, the, user, when, the, application, is, installed, however, this, may, not, be, possible, for, pre, installed, apps, it, is, not, possible, for, example, to, turn, off, the, microphone, access, of, the, pre, installed, camera, app, without, disabling, the, camera, completely, this, is, valid, also, in, android, versions, 7, and, 8, since, february, 2012, google, has, used, its, google, bouncer, malware, scanner, to, watch, over, and, scan, apps, available, in, the, google, play, store, a, verify, apps, feature, was, introduced, in, november, 2012, as, part, of, the, android, 4, 2, jelly, bean, operating, system, version, to, scan, all, apps, both, from, google, play, and, from, third, party, sources, for, malicious, behaviour, originally, only, doing, so, during, installation, verify, apps, received, an, update, in, 2014, to, constantly, scan, apps, and, in, 2017, the, feature, was, made, visible, to, users, through, a, menu, in, settings, before, installing, an, application, the, google, play, store, displays, a, list, of, the, requirements, an, app, needs, to, function, after, reviewing, these, permissions, the, user, can, choose, to, accept, or, refuse, them, installing, the, application, only, if, they, accept, in, android, 6, 0, marshmallow, the, permissions, system, was, changed, apps, are, no, longer, automatically, granted, all, of, their, specified, permissions, at, installation, time, an, opt, in, system, is, used, instead, in, which, users, are, prompted, to, grant, or, deny, individual, permissions, to, an, app, when, they, are, needed, for, the, first, time, applications, remember, the, grants, which, can, be, revoked, by, the, user, at, any, time, pre, installed, apps, however, are, not, always, part, of, this, approach, in, some, cases, it, may, not, be, possible, to, deny, certain, permissions, to, pre, installed, apps, nor, be, possible, to, disable, them, the, google, play, services, app, cannot, be, uninstalled, nor, disabled, any, force, stop, attempt, result, in, the, app, restarting, itself, the, new, permissions, model, is, used, only, by, applications, developed, for, marshmallow, using, its, software, development, kit, sdk, and, older, apps, will, continue, to, use, the, previous, all, or, nothing, approach, permissions, can, still, be, revoked, for, those, apps, though, this, might, prevent, them, from, working, properly, and, a, warning, is, displayed, to, that, effect, in, september, 2014, jason, nova, of, android, authority, reported, on, a, study, by, the, german, security, company, fraunhofer, aisec, in, antivirus, software, and, malware, threats, on, android, nova, wrote, that, the, android, operating, system, deals, with, software, packages, by, sandboxing, them, this, does, not, allow, applications, to, list, the, directory, contents, of, other, apps, to, keep, the, system, safe, by, not, allowing, the, antivirus, to, list, the, directories, of, other, apps, after, installation, applications, that, show, no, inherent, suspicious, behavior, when, downloaded, are, cleared, as, safe, if, then, later, on, parts, of, the, app, are, activated, that, turn, out, to, be, malicious, the, antivirus, will, have, no, way, to, know, since, it, is, inside, the, app, and, out, of, the, antivirus, jurisdiction, the, study, by, fraunhofer, aisec, examining, antivirus, software, from, avast, avg, bitdefender, eset, f, secure, kaspersky, lookout, mcafee, formerly, intel, security, norton, sophos, and, trend, micro, revealed, that, the, tested, antivirus, apps, do, not, provide, protection, against, customized, malware, or, targeted, attacks, and, that, the, tested, antivirus, apps, were, also, not, able, to, detect, malware, which, is, completely, unknown, to, date, but, does, not, make, any, efforts, to, hide, its, malignity, in, august, 2013, google, announced, android, device, manager, renamed, find, my, device, in, may, 2017, a, service, that, allows, users, to, remotely, track, locate, and, wipe, their, android, device, with, an, android, app, for, the, service, released, in, december, in, december, 2016, google, introduced, a, trusted, contacts, app, letting, users, request, location, tracking, of, loved, ones, during, emergencies, in, 2020, trusted, contacts, was, shut, down, and, the, location, sharing, feature, rolled, into, google, maps, on, october, 8, 2018, google, announced, new, google, play, store, requirements, to, combat, over, sharing, of, potentially, sensitive, information, including, call, and, text, logs, the, issue, stems, from, the, fact, that, many, apps, request, permissions, to, access, users, personal, information, even, if, this, information, is, not, needed, for, the, app, to, function, and, some, users, unquestionably, grant, these, permissions, alternatively, a, permission, might, be, listed, in, the, app, manifest, as, required, as, opposed, to, optional, and, the, app, would, not, install, unless, user, grants, the, permission, users, can, withdraw, any, even, required, permissions, from, any, app, in, the, device, settings, after, app, installation, but, few, users, do, this, google, promised, to, work, with, developers, and, create, exceptions, if, their, apps, require, phone, or, sms, permissions, for, core, app, functionality, the, new, policies, enforcement, started, on, january, 6, 2019, 90, days, after, policy, announcement, on, october, 8, 2018, furthermore, google, announced, a, new, target, api, level, requirement, targetsdkversion, in, manifest, at, least, android, 8, 0, api, level, 26, for, all, new, apps, and, app, updates, the, api, level, requirement, might, combat, the, practice, of, app, developers, bypassing, some, permission, screens, by, specifying, early, android, versions, that, had, a, coarser, permission, model, the, android, open, source, project, implements, a, verified, boot, chain, with, intentions, to, verify, that, executed, code, such, as, the, kernel, or, bootloader, comes, from, an, official, source, instead, of, a, malicious, actor, this, implementation, establishes, a, full, chain, of, trust, as, it, initially, starts, at, a, hardware, level, subsequently, the, boot, loader, is, verified, and, system, partitions, such, as, system, and, vendor, are, checked, for, integrity, furthermore, this, process, verifies, that, a, previous, version, of, android, has, not, been, installed, this, effectively, provides, rollback, protection, which, mitigates, exploits, that, are, similar, to, a, downgrade, attack, android, all, supported, versions, as, far, back, as, version, 4, 4, of, the, android, open, source, project, has, the, option, to, provide, a, verified, boot, chain, with, dm, verity, this, is, a, feature, in, the, linux, kernel, that, allows, for, transparent, integrity, checking, of, block, devices, this, feature, is, designed, to, mitigate, persistent, rootkits, dependence, on, proprietary, google, play, services, and, customizations, added, on, top, of, the, operating, system, by, vendors, who, license, android, from, google, is, causing, privacy, concerns, in, 2019, google, was, fined, 50, million, by, the, french, cnil, for, a, lack, of, information, regarding, their, users, two, years, later, in, 2021, researcher, douglas, leith, using, a, sort, of, data, interception, showed, that, several, data, are, sent, from, android, device, to, google, s, servers, even, when, the, phone, is, sleeping, idle, with, no, google, account, registered, into, it, several, google, applications, send, data, such, as, chrome, message, or, docs, however, youtube, is, the, only, one, to, add, a, unique, identifier, data, in, 2022, leith, showed, that, an, android, phone, sent, various, data, related, to, communications, including, phone, and, text, messages, to, google, timestamp, sender, and, receiver, plus, several, other, data, are, sent, to, google, play, services, infrastructure, even, if, the, usage, and, diag, feature, is, disabled, those, data, are, marked, with, a, unique, identifier, of, an, android, device, and, don, t, comply, with, gpdr, google, was, sanctioned, about, a, 60, million, approx, 40million, usd, in, australia, for, having, misled, its, android, customers, it, concerns, the, 2017, 2018, period, where, the, issue, regarding, misleading, location, tracking, settings, was, discovered, and, the, case, came, under, australia, s, competition, consumer, commission, responsibility, the, trial, concluded, in, 2021, when, the, court, decided, google, broke, consumer, law, for, about, 1, 3, million, of, google, account, owners, a, similar, case, to, the, 2019, french, case, regarding, location, tracking, was, brought, in, the, u, s, in, a, privacy, lawsuit, filed, by, a, coalition, of, attorneys, general, from, 40, u, s, states, a, penalty, of, usd, 391, million, was, agreed, between, google, and, the, doj, the, new, york, times, released, at, that, time, a, long, term, investigation, about, those, privacy, concerns, in, 2020, researcher, simon, weckert, performed, an, experience, by, carrying, dozen, of, google, connected, smartphones, carried, all, into, a, handcart, in, a, german, city, showing, that, the, simple, fact, pedestrian, holding, their, phone, could, impact, the, information, shown, on, google, s, maps, services, such, as, generating, traffic, jam, in, the, 2010s, many, customers, discovered, that, their, devices, were, affected, by, a, very, short, term, of, software, support, regarding, android, updates, especially, on, low, end, and, mid, range, devices, due, to, the, lack, of, investment, by, manufacturers, software, upgrades, were, not, effected, android, started, then, to, get, a, certain, reputation, due, to, very, fast, obsolescence, of, device, from, main, customer, brands, a, few, years, later, google, started, treble, project, allowing, quicker, development, and, deployment, of, android, updates, via, google, play, services, to, handle, the, part, manufacturers, don, t, this, initial, problem, was, that, for, lot, of, devices, only, one, or, few, android, versions, were, available, the, main, reason, of, this, new, functioning, is, explain, by, the, fact, upgrade, and, software, support, of, android, costs, to, phone, s, manufacturers, it, s, mainly, managed, with, contracts, especially, with, the, leader, of, communication, chipset, qualcomm, several, manufacturers, are, finger, pointed, by, some, customers, due, to, their, lack, of, support, even, a, middle, range, manufacturer, fairphone, explained, that, end, of, software, support, wasn, t, due, to, their, choice, but, qualcomm, s, decision, qualcomm, s, has, even, been, finger, pointed, by, apple, executive, due, to, their, very, aggressive, antitrust, policy, especially, for, the, first, iphone, design, on, the, first, hand, several, initiative, for, alternative, os, to, stock, roms, the, default, one, provided, by, manufacturer, to, get, a, most, up, to, date, version, of, android, through, cyanogenmod, then, lineageos, project, secondly, other, mobile, operating, system, alternative, projects, started, such, as, sailfish, for, jolla, and, xperia, phones, plus, community, driven, projects, ubuntu, touch, postmarketos, and, even, a, android, independent, and, qualcomm, independent, phone, as, the, librem, made, by, purism, with, nxp, components, thirdly, after, years, of, complaints, by, customers, samsung, the, biggest, manufacturer, of, android, based, smartphones, and, devices, decided, in, 2024, firstly, to, guarantee, software, support, from, 2, to, 4, years, for, devices, sold, starting, 2022, then, few, times, after, qualcomm, accompanied, this, initiative, by, extending, support, for, manufacturers, from, 4, up, to, 7, years, of, updates, for, the, comparison, apple, s, iphone, product, range, are, mainly, supported, not, less, than, 4, years, since, the, iphone, 4, released, in, 2010, in, addition, the, first, jolla, 1, phone, released, in, 2013, had, its, last, update, in, 2021, since, it, has, been, released, several, observers, and, experts, noticed, that, at, the, opposite, of, all, linux, distributions, android, isn, t, as, opensource, as, it, looks, almost, all, components, from, google, and, manufacturers, are, proprietary, closed, source, where, linux, distros, are, driven, by, community, and, fully, open, source, google, still, manages, everything, of, aosp, project, as, the, leader, organization, the, source, code, for, android, is, open, source, it, is, developed, in, private, by, google, with, the, source, code, released, publicly, when, a, new, version, of, android, is, released, google, publishes, most, of, the, code, including, network, and, telephony, stacks, under, the, non, copyleft, apache, license, version, 2, 0, which, allows, modification, and, redistribution, the, license, does, not, grant, rights, to, the, android, trademark, so, device, manufacturers, and, wireless, carriers, have, to, license, it, from, google, under, individual, contracts, associated, linux, kernel, changes, are, released, under, the, copyleft, gnu, general, public, license, version, 2, developed, by, the, open, handset, alliance, with, the, source, code, publicly, available, at, all, times, the, only, android, release, which, was, not, immediately, made, available, as, source, code, was, the, tablet, only, 3, 0, honeycomb, release, the, reason, according, to, andy, rubin, in, an, official, android, blog, post, was, because, honeycomb, was, rushed, for, production, of, the, motorola, xoom, and, they, did, not, want, third, parties, creating, a, really, bad, user, experience, by, attempting, to, put, onto, smartphones, a, version, of, android, intended, for, tablets, only, the, base, android, operating, system, including, some, applications, is, open, source, software, whereas, most, android, devices, ship, with, a, substantial, amount, of, proprietary, software, such, as, google, mobile, services, which, includes, applications, such, as, google, play, store, google, search, and, google, play, services, a, software, layer, that, provides, apis, for, the, integration, with, google, provided, services, among, others, these, applications, must, be, licensed, from, google, by, device, makers, and, can, only, be, shipped, on, devices, which, meet, its, compatibility, guidelines, and, other, requirements, custom, certified, distributions, of, android, produced, by, manufacturers, such, as, samsung, experience, may, also, replace, certain, stock, android, apps, with, their, own, proprietary, variants, and, add, additional, software, not, included, in, the, stock, android, operating, system, with, the, advent, of, the, google, pixel, line, of, devices, google, itself, has, also, made, specific, android, features, timed, or, permanent, exclusives, to, the, pixel, series, there, may, also, be, binary, blob, drivers, required, for, certain, hardware, components, in, the, device, the, best, known, fully, open, source, android, services, are, the, lineageos, distribution, and, microg, which, acts, as, an, open, source, replacement, of, google, play, services, richard, stallman, and, the, free, software, foundation, have, been, critical, of, android, and, have, recommended, the, usage, of, alternatives, such, as, replicant, because, drivers, and, firmware, vital, for, the, proper, functioning, of, android, devices, are, usually, proprietary, and, because, the, google, play, store, application, can, forcibly, install, or, uninstall, applications, and, as, a, result, invite, non, free, software, in, both, cases, the, use, of, closed, source, software, causes, the, system, to, become, vulnerable, to, backdoors, it, has, been, argued, that, because, developers, are, often, required, to, purchase, the, google, branded, android, license, this, has, turned, the, theoretically, open, system, into, a, freemium, service, 20, google, licenses, their, google, mobile, services, software, along, with, the, android, trademarks, only, to, hardware, manufacturers, for, devices, that, meet, google, s, compatibility, standards, specified, in, the, android, compatibility, program, document, thus, forks, of, android, that, make, major, changes, to, the, operating, system, itself, do, not, include, any, of, google, s, non, free, components, stay, incompatible, with, applications, that, require, them, and, must, ship, with, an, alternative, software, marketplace, in, lieu, of, google, play, store, a, prominent, example, of, such, an, android, fork, is, amazon, s, fire, os, which, is, used, on, the, kindle, fire, line, of, tablets, and, oriented, toward, amazon, services, the, shipment, of, android, devices, without, gms, is, also, common, in, mainland, china, as, google, does, not, do, business, there, in, 2014, google, also, began, to, require, that, all, android, devices, which, license, the, google, mobile, services, software, display, a, prominent, powered, by, android, logo, on, their, boot, screens, google, has, also, enforced, preferential, bundling, and, placement, of, google, mobile, services, on, devices, including, mandated, bundling, of, the, entire, main, suite, of, google, applications, mandatory, placement, of, shortcuts, to, google, search, and, the, play, store, app, on, or, near, the, main, home, screen, page, in, its, default, configuration, and, granting, a, larger, share, of, search, revenue, to, oems, who, agree, to, not, include, third, party, app, stores, on, their, devices, in, march, 2018, it, was, reported, that, google, had, begun, to, block, uncertified, android, devices, from, using, google, mobile, services, software, and, display, a, warning, indicating, that, the, device, manufacturer, has, preloaded, google, apps, and, services, without, certification, from, google, users, of, custom, roms, can, register, their, device, id, to, their, google, account, to, remove, this, block, some, stock, applications, and, components, in, aosp, code, that, were, formerly, used, by, earlier, versions, of, android, such, as, search, music, calendar, and, the, location, api, were, abandoned, by, google, in, favor, of, non, free, replacements, distributed, through, play, store, google, search, youtube, music, and, google, calendar, and, google, play, services, which, are, no, longer, open, source, moreover, open, source, variants, of, some, applications, also, exclude, functions, that, are, present, in, their, non, free, versions, these, measures, are, likely, intended, to, discourage, forks, and, encourage, commercial, licensing, in, line, with, google, requirements, as, the, majority, of, the, operating, system, s, core, functionality, is, dependent, on, proprietary, components, licensed, exclusively, by, google, and, it, would, take, significant, development, resources, to, develop, an, alternative, suite, of, software, and, apis, to, replicate, or, replace, them, apps, that, do, not, use, google, components, would, also, be, at, a, functional, disadvantage, as, they, can, only, use, apis, contained, within, the, os, itself, in, turn, third, party, apps, may, have, dependencies, on, google, play, services, members, of, the, open, handset, alliance, which, include, the, majority, of, android, oems, are, also, contractually, forbidden, from, producing, android, devices, based, on, forks, of, the, os, in, 2012, acer, inc, was, forced, by, google, to, halt, production, on, a, device, powered, by, alibaba, group, s, aliyun, os, with, threats, of, removal, from, the, oha, as, google, deemed, the, platform, to, be, an, incompatible, version, of, android, alibaba, group, defended, the, allegations, arguing, that, the, os, was, a, distinct, platform, from, android, primarily, using, html5, apps, but, incorporated, portions, of, android, s, platform, to, allow, backwards, compatibility, with, third, party, android, software, indeed, the, devices, did, ship, with, an, application, store, which, offered, android, apps, however, the, majority, of, them, were, pirated, android, received, a, lukewarm, reaction, when, it, was, unveiled, in, 2007, although, analysts, were, impressed, with, the, respected, technology, companies, that, had, partnered, with, google, to, form, the, open, handset, alliance, it, was, unclear, whether, mobile, phone, manufacturers, would, be, willing, to, replace, their, existing, operating, systems, with, android, the, idea, of, an, open, source, linux, based, development, platform, sparked, interest, but, there, were, additional, worries, about, android, facing, strong, competition, from, established, players, in, the, smartphone, market, such, as, nokia, and, microsoft, and, rival, linux, mobile, operating, systems, that, were, in, development, these, established, players, were, skeptical, nokia, was, quoted, as, saying, we, don, t, see, this, as, a, threat, and, a, member, of, microsoft, s, windows, mobile, team, stated, i, don, t, understand, the, impact, that, they, are, going, to, have, since, then, android, has, grown, to, become, the, most, widely, used, smartphone, operating, system, and, one, of, the, fastest, mobile, experiences, available, reviewers, have, highlighted, the, open, source, nature, of, the, operating, system, as, one, of, its, defining, strengths, allowing, companies, such, as, nokia, nokia, x, family, amazon, kindle, fire, barnes, noble, nook, ouya, baidu, and, others, to, fork, the, software, and, release, hardware, running, their, own, customised, version, of, android, as, a, result, it, has, been, described, by, technology, website, ars, technica, as, practically, the, default, operating, system, for, launching, new, hardware, for, companies, without, their, own, mobile, platforms, this, openness, and, flexibility, is, also, present, at, the, level, of, the, end, user, android, allows, extensive, customisation, of, devices, by, their, owners, and, apps, are, freely, available, from, non, google, app, stores, and, third, party, websites, these, have, been, cited, as, among, the, main, advantages, of, android, phones, over, others, despite, android, s, popularity, including, an, activation, rate, three, times, that, of, ios, there, have, been, reports, that, google, has, not, been, able, to, leverage, their, other, products, and, web, services, successfully, to, turn, android, into, the, money, maker, that, analysts, had, expected, the, verge, suggested, that, google, is, losing, control, of, android, due, to, the, extensive, customization, and, proliferation, of, non, google, apps, and, services, amazon, s, kindle, fire, line, uses, fire, os, a, heavily, modified, fork, of, android, which, does, not, include, or, support, any, of, google, s, proprietary, components, and, requires, that, users, obtain, software, from, its, competing, amazon, appstore, instead, of, play, store, in, 2014, in, an, effort, to, improve, prominence, of, the, android, brand, google, began, to, require, that, devices, featuring, its, proprietary, components, display, an, android, logo, on, the, boot, screen, android, has, suffered, from, fragmentation, a, situation, where, the, variety, of, android, devices, in, terms, of, both, hardware, variations, and, differences, in, the, software, running, on, them, makes, the, task, of, developing, applications, that, work, consistently, across, the, ecosystem, harder, than, rival, platforms, such, as, ios, where, hardware, and, software, varies, less, for, example, according, to, data, from, opensignal, in, july, 2013, there, were, 11, 868, models, of, android, devices, numerous, screen, sizes, and, eight, android, os, versions, simultaneously, in, use, while, the, large, majority, of, ios, users, have, upgraded, to, the, latest, iteration, of, that, os, critics, such, as, apple, insider, have, asserted, that, fragmentation, via, hardware, and, software, pushed, android, s, growth, through, large, volumes, of, low, end, budget, priced, devices, running, older, versions, of, android, they, maintain, this, forces, android, developers, to, write, for, the, lowest, common, denominator, to, reach, as, many, users, as, possible, who, have, too, little, incentive, to, make, use, of, the, latest, hardware, or, software, features, only, available, on, a, smaller, percentage, of, devices, however, opensignal, who, develops, both, android, and, ios, apps, concluded, that, although, fragmentation, can, make, development, trickier, android, s, wider, global, reach, also, increases, the, potential, reward, android, is, the, most, used, operating, system, on, phones, in, virtually, all, countries, with, some, countries, such, as, india, having, over, 96, market, share, on, tablets, usage, is, more, even, as, ios, is, a, bit, more, popular, globally, research, company, canalys, estimated, in, the, second, quarter, of, 2009, that, android, had, a, 2, 8, share, of, worldwide, smartphone, shipments, by, may, 2010, android, had, a, 10, worldwide,

all, pcs, in, the, second, quarter, of, 2014, android, s, share, of, the, global, smartphone, shipment, market, was, 84, 7, a, new, record, this, had, grown, to, 87, 5, worldwide, market, share, by, the, third, quarter, of, 2016, leaving, main, competitor, ios, with, 12, 1, market, share, according, to, an, april, 2017, statcounter, report, android, overtook, microsoft, windows, to, become, the, most, popular, operating, system, for, total, internet, usage, it, has, maintained, the, plurality, since, then, in, september, 2015, google, announced, that, android, had, 1, 4, billion, monthly, active, users, this, changed, to, 2, billion, monthly, active, users, in, may, 2017, despite, its, success, on, smartphones, initially, android, tablet, adoption, was, slow, then, later, caught, up, with, the, ipad, in, most, countries, one, of, the, main, causes, was, the, chicken, or, the, egg, situation, where, consumers, were, hesitant, to, buy, an, android, tablet, due, to, a, lack, of, high, quality, tablet, applications, but, developers, were, hesitant, to, spend, time, and, resources, developing, tablet, applications, until, there, was, a, significant, market, for, them, the, content, and, app, ecosystem, proved, more, important, than, hardware, specs, as, the, selling, point, for, tablets, due, to, the, lack, of, android, tablet, specific, applications, in, 2011, early, android, tablets, had, to, make, do, with, existing, smartphone, applications, that, were, ill, suited, to, larger, screen, sizes, whereas, the, dominance, of, apple, s, ipad, was, reinforced, by, the, large, number, of, tablet, specific, ios, applications, despite, app, support, in, its, infancy, a, considerable, number, of, android, tablets, like, the, barnes, noble, nook, alongside, those, using, other, operating, systems, such, as, the, hp, touchpad, and, blackberry, playbook, were, rushed, out, to, market, in, an, attempt, to, capitalize, on, the, success, of, the, ipad, infoworld, has, suggested, that, some, android, manufacturers, initially, treated, their, first, tablets, as, a, frankenphone, business, a, short, term, low, investment, opportunity, by, placing, a, smartphone, optimized, android, os, before, android, 3, 0, honeycomb, for, tablets, was, available, on, a, device, while, neglecting, user, interface, this, approach, such, as, with, the, dell, streak, failed, to, gain, market, traction, with, consumers, as, well, as, damaging, the, early, reputation, of, android, tablets, furthermore, several, android, tablets, such, as, the, motorola, xoom, were, priced, the, same, or, higher, than, the, ipad, which, hurt, sales, an, exception, was, the, amazon, kindle, fire, which, relied, upon, lower, pricing, as, well, as, access, to, amazon, s, ecosystem, of, applications, and, content, this, began, to, change, in, 2012, with, the, release, of, the, affordable, nexus, 7, and, a, push, by, google, for, developers, to, write, better, tablet, applications, according, to, international, data, corporation, shipments, of, android, powered, tablets, surpassed, ipads, in, q3, 2012, as, of, the, end, of, 2013, over, 191, 6, million, android, tablets, had, sold, in, three, years, since, 2011, this, made, android, tablets, the, most, sold, type, of, tablet, in, 2013, surpassing, ipads, in, the, second, quarter, of, 2013, according, to, statcounter, s, web, use, statistics, as, of, 2020, android, tablets, represent, the, majority, of, tablet, devices, used, in, africa, 70, south, america, 65, while, less, than, half, elsewhere, e, g, europe, 44, asia, 44, north, america, 34, and, oceania, australia, 18, there, are, countries, on, all, continents, where, android, tablets, are, the, majority, for, example, mexico, in, march, 2016, galen, gruman, of, infoworld, stated, that, android, devices, could, be, a, real, part, of, your, business, there, s, no, longer, a, reason, to, keep, android, at, arm, s, length, it, can, now, be, as, integral, to, your, mobile, portfolio, as, apple, s, ios, devices, are, a, year, earlier, gruman, had, stated, that, microsoft, s, own, mobile, office, apps, were, better, on, ios, and, android, than, on, microsoft, s, own, windows, 10, devices, android, has, 71, market, share, vs, apple, s, ios, ipados, at, 28, on, tablets, alone, apple, is, slightly, ahead, i, e, 44, vs, 56, though, android, is, ahead, in, virtually, all, countries, the, latest, android, 14, is, the, most, popular, android, version, on, smartphones, and, on, tablets, as, of, 2024, android, 14, is, most, popular, single, android, version, on, smartphones, at, 26, followed, by, android, 13, 12, down, to, pie, 9, 0, in, that, order, android, is, more, used, than, ios, is, virtually, all, countries, with, few, exceptions, such, as, ios, has, a, 56, share, in, the, us, the, latest, android, 14, is, the, most, used, single, version, in, several, countries, e, g, the, us, canada, australia, with, over, a, third, of, the, share, in, those, countries, and, it, s, also, single, most, used, in, india, and, most, of, european, countries, usage, of, android, 12, and, newer, i, e, supported, versions, is, at, 64, the, rest, of, users, are, not, supported, with, security, updates, with, recently, unsupported, android, 11, use, is, at, 78, 55, on, tablets, android, 14, is, again, the, most, popular, single, version, at, 17, usage, of, android, 12, and, newer, i, e, supported, versions, is, at, 46, on, android, tablets, and, with, android, 11, until, recently, supported, at, 56, the, usage, share, varies, a, lot, by, country, since, april, 2024, 85, of, devices, have, vulkan, graphics, support, 77, 6, support, vulkan, 1, 1, or, higher, thereof, 6, 6, supporting, vulkan, 1, 3, the, successor, to, opengl, at, the, same, time, 100, 0, of, the, devices, have, support, for, opengl, es, 2, 0, or, higher, 96, are, on, opengl, es, 3, 0, or, higher, and, 88, 6, are, using, the, latest, version, opengl, es, 3, 2, paid, android, applications, in, the, past, were, simple, to, pirate, in, a, may, 2012, interview, with, eurogamer, the, developers, of, football, manager, stated, that, the, ratio, of, pirated, players, vs, legitimate, players, was, 9, 1, for, their, game, football, manager, handheld, however, not, every, developer, agreed, that, piracy, rates, were, an, issue, for, example, in, july, 2012, the, developers, of, the, game, wind, up, knight, said, that, piracy, levels, of, their, game, were, only, 12, and, most, of, the, piracy, came, from, china, where, people, cannot, purchase, apps, from, google, play, in, 2010, google, released, a, tool, for, validating, authorized, purchases, for, use, within, apps, but, developers, complained, that, this, was, insufficient, and, trivial, to, crack, google, responded, that, the, tool, especially, its, initial, release, was, intended, as, a, sample, framework, for, developers, to, modify, and, build, upon, depending, on, their, needs, not, as, a, finished, piracy, solution, android, jelly, bean, introduced, the, ability, for, paid, applications, to, be, encrypted, so, that, they, may, work, only, on, the, device, for, which, they, were, purchased, the, success, of, android, has, made, it, a, target, for, patent, and, copyright, litigation, between, technology, companies, both, android, and, android, phone, manufacturers, having, been, involved, in, numerous, patent, lawsuits, and, other, legal, challenges, on, august, 12, 2010, oracle, sued, google, over, claimed, infringement, of, copyrights, and, patents, related, to, the, java, programming, language, oracle, originally, sought, damages, up, to, 6, 1, billion, but, this, valuation, was, rejected, by, a, united, states, federal, judge, who, asked, oracle, to, revise, the, estimate, in, response, google, submitted, multiple, lines, of, defense, counterclaiming, that, android, did, not, infringe, on, oracle, s, patents, or, copyright, that, oracle, s, patents, were, invalid, and, several, other, defenses, they, said, that, android, s, java, runtime, environment, is, based, on, apache, harmony, a, clean, room, implementation, of, the, java, class, libraries, and, an, independently, developed, virtual, machine, called, dalvik, in, may, 2012, the, jury, in, this, case, found, that, google, did, not, infringe, on, oracle, s, patents, and, the, trial, judge, ruled, that, the, structure, of, the, java, apis, used, by, google, was, not, copyrightable, the, parties, agreed, to, zero, dollars, in, statutory, damages, for, a, small, amount, of, copied, code, on, may, 9, 2014, the, federal, circuit, partially, reversed, the, district, court, ruling, ruling, in, oracle, s, favor, on, the, copyrightability, issue, and, remanding, the, issue, of, fair, use, to, the, district, court, in, december, 2015, google, announced, that, the, next, major, release, of, android, android, nougat, would, switch, to, openjdk, which, is, the, official, open, source, implementation, of, the, java, platform, instead, of, using, the, now, discontinued, apache, harmony, project, as, its, runtime, code, reflecting, this, change, was, also, posted, to, the, aosp, source, repository, in, its, announcement, google, claimed, this, was, part, of, an, effort, to, create, a, common, code, base, between, java, on, android, and, other, platforms, google, later, admitted, in, a, court, filing, that, this, was, part, of, an, effort, to, address, the, disputes, with, oracle, as, its, use, of, openjdk, code, is, governed, under, the, gnu, general, public, license, gpl, with, a, linking, exception, and, that, any, damages, claim, associated, with, the, new, versions, expressly, licensed, by, oracle, under, openjdk, would, require, a, separate, analysis, of, damages, from, earlier, releases, in, june, 2016, a, united, states, federal, court, ruled, in, favor, of, google, stating, that, its, use, of, the, apis, was, fair, use, in, april, 2021, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, ruled, that, google, s, use, of, the, java, apis, was, within, the, bounds, of, fair, use, reversing, the, federal, circuit, appeals, court, ruling, and, remanding, the, case, for, further, hearing, the, majority, opinion, began, with, the, assumption, that, the, apis, may, be, copyrightable, and, thus, proceeded, with, a, review, of, the, factors, that, contributed, to, fair, use, in, 2013, fairsearch, a, lobbying, organization, supported, by, microsoft, oracle, and, others, filed, a, complaint, regarding, android, with, the, european, commission, alleging, that, its, free, of, charge, distribution, model, constituted, anti, competitive, predatory, pricing, the, free, software, foundation, europe, whose, donors, include, google, disputed, the, fairsearch, allegations, on, april, 20, 2016, the, eu, filed, a, formal, antitrust, complaint, against, google, based, upon, the, fairsearch, allegations, arguing, that, its, leverage, over, android, vendors, including, the, mandatory, bundling, of, the, entire, suite, of, proprietary, google, software, hindering, the, ability, for, competing, search, providers, to, be, integrated, into, android, and, barring, vendors, from, producing, devices, running, forks, of, android, constituted, anti, competitive, practices, in, august, 2016, google, was, fined, us, 6, 75, million, by, the, russian, federal, antimonopoly, service, fas, under, similar, allegations, by, yandex, the, european, commission, issued, its, decision, on, july, 18, 2018, determining, that, google, had, conducted, three, operations, related, to, android, that, were, in, violation, of, antitrust, regulations, bundling, google, s, search, and, chrome, as, part, of, android, blocking, phone, manufacturers, from, using, forked, versions, of, android, and, establishing, deals, with, phone, manufacturers, and, network, providers, to, exclusively, bundle, the, google, search, application, on, handsets, a, practice, google, ended, by, 2014, the, eu, fined, google, for, 4, 3, billion, about, us, 5, billion, and, required, the, company, to, end, this, conduct, within, 90, days, google, filed, its, appeal, of, the, ruling, in, october, 2018, though, will, not, ask, for, any, interim, measures, to, delay, the, onset, of, conduct, requirements, on, october, 16, 2018,
