plate, armour, is, a, historical, type, of, personal, body, armour, made, from, bronze, iron, or, steel, plates, culminating, in, the, iconic, suit, of, armour, entirely, encasing, the, wearer, full, plate, steel, armour, developed, in, europe, during, the, late, middle, ages, especially, in, the, context, of, the, hundred, years, war, from, the, coat, of, plates, popular, in, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, century, worn, over, mail, suits, during, the, 14th, century, a, century, famous, for, the, transitional, armour, in, that, plate, gradually, replaced, chain, mail, in, europe, full, plate, armour, reached, its, peak, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, the, full, suit, of, armour, also, referred, to, as, a, panoply, is, thus, a, feature, of, the, very, end, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, period, its, popular, association, with, the, medieval, knight, is, due, to, the, specialised, jousting, armour, which, developed, in, the, 16th, century, full, suits, of, gothic, plate, armour, and, milanese, plate, armour, were, worn, on, the, battlefields, of, the, burgundian, wars, wars, of, the, roses, polish, teutonic, wars, eighty, years, war, french, wars, of, religion, italian, wars, hungarian, ottoman, wars, ottoman, habsburg, wars, polish, ottoman, wars, a, significant, part, of, the, hundred, years, war, and, even, the, thirty, years, war, the, most, heavily, armoured, troops, of, the, period, were, heavy, cavalry, such, as, the, gendarmes, and, early, cuirassiers, but, the, infantry, troops, of, the, swiss, mercenaries, and, the, landsknechts, also, took, to, wearing, lighter, suits, of, three, quarters, munition, armour, leaving, the, lower, legs, unprotected, the, use, of, plate, armour, began, to, decline, in, the, early, 17th, century, but, it, remained, common, both, among, the, nobility, e, g, the, emperor, ferdinand, ii, louis, xiii, philip, iv, of, spain, maurice, of, orange, and, gustavus, adolphus, and, the, cuirassiers, throughout, the, european, wars, of, religion, after, the, mid, 17th, century, plate, armour, was, mostly, reduced, to, the, simple, breastplate, or, cuirass, worn, by, cuirassiers, with, the, exception, of, the, polish, hussars, that, still, used, considerable, amounts, of, plate, this, was, due, to, the, development, of, the, musket, which, could, penetrate, armour, at, a, considerable, distance, for, infantry, the, breastplate, gained, renewed, importance, with, the, development, of, shrapnel, in, the, late, napoleonic, wars, the, use, of, steel, plates, sewn, into, flak, jackets, dates, to, world, war, ii, and, was, replaced, by, more, modern, materials, such, as, fibre, reinforced, plastic, since, the, mid, 20th, century, mail, armour, is, a, layer, of, protective, clothing, worn, most, commonly, from, the, 9th, to, the, 13th, century, though, it, would, continue, to, be, worn, under, plate, armour, until, the, 15th, century, mail, was, made, from, hundreds, of, small, interlinking, iron, or, steel, rings, held, together, by, rivets, it, was, made, this, way, so, that, it, would, be, able, to, follow, the, contour, of, the, wearer, s, body, maximizing, comfort, mail, armour, was, designed, mainly, to, defend, against, thrusting, and, cutting, weapons, rather, than, bludgeons, typical, clothing, articles, made, of, mail, at, the, time, would, be, hooded, cloaks, gloves, trousers, and, shoes, from, the, 10th, to, the, 13th, century, mail, armour, was, so, popular, in, europe, that, it, was, known, as, the, age, of, mail, partial, plate, armour, made, out, of, bronze, which, protected, the, chest, and, the, lower, limbs, was, used, by, the, ancient, greeks, as, early, as, the, late, bronze, age, the, dendra, panoply, protected, the, entire, torso, on, both, sides, and, included, shoulder, and, neck, protections, less, restrictive, and, heavy, armour, would, become, more, widespread, in, the, form, of, the, muscle, cuirass, during, classic, antiquity, before, being, superseded, by, other, types, of, armour, parthian, and, sassanian, heavy, cavalry, known, as, clibanarii, used, cuirasses, made, out, of, scales, or, mail, and, small, overlapping, plates, in, the, manner, of, the, manica, for, the, protection, of, arms, and, legs, plate, armour, in, the, form, of, the, lorica, segmentata, was, used, by, the, roman, empire, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, 4th, century, ad, single, plates, of, metal, armour, were, again, used, from, the, late, 13th, century, on, to, protect, joints, and, shins, and, these, were, worn, over, a, mail, hauberk, gradually, the, number, of, plate, components, of, medieval, armour, increased, protecting, further, areas, of, the, body, and, in, barding, those, of, a, cavalryman, s, horse, armourers, developed, skills, in, articulating, the, lames, or, individual, plates, for, parts, of, the, body, that, needed, to, be, flexible, and, in, fitting, armour, to, the, individual, wearer, like, a, tailor, the, cost, of, a, full, suit, of, high, quality, fitted, armour, as, opposed, to, the, cheaper, munition, armour, equivalent, of, ready, to, wear, was, enormous, and, inevitably, restricted, to, the, wealthy, who, were, seriously, committed, to, either, soldiering, or, jousting, the, rest, of, an, army, wore, inconsistent, mixtures, of, pieces, with, mail, still, playing, an, important, part, in, the, kofun, period, 250, 538, iron, plate, cuirasses, tank, and, helmets, were, being, made, plate, armour, was, used, in, japan, during, the, nara, period, 646, 793, both, plate, and, lamellar, armours, have, been, found, in, burial, mounds, and, haniwa, ancient, clay, figures, have, been, found, depicting, warriors, wearing, full, armour, in, japan, the, warfare, of, the, sengoku, period, 1467, 1615, required, large, quantities, of, armour, to, be, produced, for, the, ever, growing, armies, of, foot, soldiers, ashigaru, simple, munition, quality, chest, armours, d, and, helmets, kabuto, were, mass, produced, in, 1543, the, portuguese, brought, matchlock, firearms, tanegashima, to, japan, as, japanese, swordsmiths, began, mass, producing, matchlock, firearms, and, firearms, became, used, in, war, the, use, of, lamellar, armour, yoroi, and, d, maru, previously, used, as, samurai, armour, gradually, decreased, japanese, armour, makers, started, to, make, new, types, of, armour, made, of, larger, iron, plate, and, plated, leather, this, new, suit, of, armour, is, called, t, sei, gusoku, gusoku, which, means, modern, armour, the, type, of, gusoku, which, covered, the, front, and, back, of, the, body, with, a, single, iron, plate, with, a, raised, center, and, a, v, shaped, bottom, like, plate, armour, was, specifically, called, nanban, dou, gusoku, western, style, gusoku, and, was, used, by, some, samurai, japanese, armour, makers, designed, bulletproof, plate, armour, called, tameshi, gusoku, bullet, tested, which, allowed, soldiers, to, continue, wearing, armour, despite, the, heavy, use, of, firearms, in, the, late, 16th, century, in, the, 17th, century, warfare, in, japan, came, to, an, end, but, the, samurai, continued, to, use, plate, armour, until, the, end, of, the, samurai, era, in, the, 1860s, with, the, known, last, use, of, samurai, armour, occurring, in, 1877, during, the, satsuma, rebellion, by, about, 1420, complete, suits, of, plate, armour, had, been, developed, in, europe, a, full, suit, of, plate, armour, would, have, consisted, of, a, helmet, a, gorget, or, bevor, spaulders, pauldrons, with, gardbraces, to, cover, the, armpits, as, was, seen, in, french, armour, or, besagews, also, known, as, rondels, which, were, mostly, used, in, gothic, armour, rerebraces, couters, vambraces, gauntlets, a, cuirass, breastplate, and, backplate, with, a, fauld, tassets, and, a, culet, a, mail, skirt, cuisses, poleyns, greaves, and, sabatons, the, very, fullest, sets, known, as, garnitures, more, often, made, for, jousting, than, war, included, pieces, of, exchange, alternate, pieces, suiting, different, purposes, so, that, the, suit, could, be, configured, for, a, range, of, different, uses, for, example, fighting, on, foot, or, on, horse, by, the, late, middle, ages, even, infantry, could, afford, to, wear, several, pieces, of, plate, armour, armour, production, was, a, profitable, and, pervasive, industry, during, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, a, complete, suit, of, plate, armour, made, from, well, tempered, steel, would, weigh, around, 15, 25, kg, 33, 55, lb, the, wearer, remained, highly, agile, and, could, jump, run, and, otherwise, move, freely, as, the, weight, of, the, armour, was, spread, evenly, throughout, the, body, the, armour, was, articulated, and, covered, a, man, s, entire, body, completely, from, neck, to, toe, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, plate, armoured, soldiers, were, the, nucleus, of, every, army, large, bodies, of, men, at, arms, numbering, thousands, or, even, more, than, ten, thousand, men, approximately, 60, to, 70, of, french, armies, were, men, at, arms, and, the, percentage, was, also, high, in, other, countries, were, fighting, on, foot, wearing, full, plate, next, to, archers, and, crossbowmen, this, was, commonly, seen, in, the, western, european, armies, especially, during, the, hundred, years, war, the, wars, of, the, roses, or, the, italian, wars, european, leaders, in, armouring, techniques, were, northern, italians, especially, from, milan, and, southern, germans, who, had, somewhat, different, styles, but, styles, were, diffused, around, europe, often, by, the, movement, of, armourers, the, renaissance, greenwich, armour, was, made, by, a, royal, workshop, near, london, that, had, imported, italian, flemish, and, mostly, german, craftsmen, though, it, soon, developed, its, own, unique, style, ottoman, turkey, also, made, wide, use, of, plate, armour, but, incorporated, large, amounts, of, mail, into, their, armour, which, was, widely, used, by, shock, troops, such, as, the, janissary, corps, plate, armour, gave, the, wearer, very, good, protection, against, sword, cuts, as, well, against, spear, thrusts, and, provided, decent, defense, against, blunt, weapons, the, evolution, of, plate, armour, also, triggered, developments, in, the, design, of, offensive, weapons, while, this, armour, was, effective, against, cuts, or, strikes, their, weak, points, could, be, exploited, by, thrusting, weapons, such, as, estocs, poleaxes, and, halberds, the, effect, of, arrows, and, bolts, is, still, a, point, of, contention, with, regard, to, plate, armour, the, evolution, of, the, 14th, century, plate, armour, also, triggered, the, development, of, various, polearms, they, were, designed, to, deliver, a, strong, impact, and, concentrate, energy, on, a, small, area, and, cause, damage, through, the, plate, maces, war, hammers, and, pollaxes, poleaxes, were, used, to, inflict, blunt, force, trauma, through, armour, strong, blows, to, the, head, could, result, in, concussion, even, if, the, armour, is, not, penetrated, fluted, plate, was, not, only, decorative, but, also, reinforced, the, plate, against, bending, under, striking, or, blunt, impact, this, offsets, against, the, tendency, for, flutes, to, catch, piercing, blows, in, armoured, techniques, taught, in, the, german, school, of, swordsmanship, the, attacker, concentrates, on, these, weak, spots, resulting, in, a, fighting, style, very, different, from, unarmoured, sword, fighting, because, of, this, weakness, most, warriors, wore, a, mail, shirt, haubergeon, or, hauberk, beneath, their, plate, armour, or, coat, of, plates, later, full, mail, shirts, were, replaced, with, mail, patches, called, gussets, which, were, sewn, onto, a, gambeson, or, arming, jacket, further, protection, for, plate, armour, was, the, use, of, small, round, plates, called, besagews, that, covered, the, armpit, area, and, the, addition, of, couters, and, poleyns, with, wings, to, protect, the, inside, of, the, joint, german, so, called, maximilian, armour, of, the, early, 16th, century, is, a, style, using, heavy, fluting, and, some, decorative, etching, as, opposed, to, the, plainer, finish, on, 15th, century, white, armour, the, shapes, include, influence, from, italian, styles, this, era, also, saw, the, use, of, closed, helms, as, opposed, to, the, 15th, century, style, sallets, and, barbutes, during, the, early, 16th, century, the, helmet, and, neckguard, design, was, reformed, to, produce, the, so, called, n, rnberg, armour, many, of, them, masterpieces, of, workmanship, and, design, as, firearms, became, better, and, more, common, on, the, battlefield, the, utility, of, full, armour, gradually, declined, and, full, suits, became, restricted, to, those, made, for, jousting, which, continued, to, develop, the, decoration, of, fine, armour, greatly, increased, in, the, period, using, a, range, of, techniques, and, further, greatly, increasing, the, cost, elaborately, decorated, plate, armour, for, royalty, and, the, very, wealthy, was, being, produced, highly, decorated, armour, is, often, called, parade, armour, a, somewhat, misleading, term, as, such, armour, might, well, be, worn, on, active, military, service, steel, plate, armour, for, henry, ii, of, france, made, in, 1555, is, covered, with, meticulous, embossing, which, has, been, subjected, to, blueing, silvering, and, gilding, such, work, required, armourers, to, either, collaborate, with, artists, or, have, artistic, skill, of, their, own, another, alternative, was, to, take, designs, from, ornament, prints, and, other, prints, as, was, often, done, daniel, hopfer, was, an, etcher, of, armour, by, training, who, developed, etching, as, a, form, of, printmaking, other, artists, such, as, hans, holbein, the, younger, produced, designs, for, armour, the, milanese, armourer, filippo, negroli, from, a, leading, dynasty, of, armourers, was, the, most, famous, modeller, of, figurative, relief, decoration, on, armour, reduced, plate, armour, typically, consisting, of, a, breastplate, a, burgonet, morion, or, cabasset, and, gauntlets, however, also, became, popular, among, 16th, century, mercenaries, and, there, are, many, references, to, so, called, munition, armour, being, ordered, for, infantrymen, at, a, fraction, of, the, cost, of, full, plate, armour, this, mass, produced, armour, was, often, heavier, and, made, of, lower, quality, metal, than, fine, armour, for, commanders, specialised, jousting, armour, produced, in, the, late, 15th, to, 16th, century, was, heavier, and, could, weigh, as, much, as, 50, kg, 110, lb, as, it, was, not, intended, for, free, combat, it, did, not, need, to, permit, free, movement, the, only, limiting, factor, being, the, maximum, weight, that, could, be, carried, by, a, warhorse, of, the, period, the, medieval, joust, has, its, origins, in, the, military, tactics, of, heavy, cavalry, during, the, high, middle, ages, since, the, 15th, century, jousting, had, become, a, sport, hastilude, with, less, direct, relevance, to, warfare, for, example, using, separate, specialized, armour, and, equipment, during, the, 1490s, emperor, maximilian, i, invested, a, great, deal, of, effort, in, perfecting, the, sport, for, which, he, received, his, nickname, of, the, last, knight, rennen, and, stechen, were, two, sportive, forms, of, the, joust, developed, during, the, 15th, century, and, practiced, throughout, the, 16th, century, the, armours, used, for, these, two, respective, styles, of, the, joust, were, known, as, rennzeug, and, stechzeug, respectively, the, stechzeug, in, particular, developed, into, extremely, heavy, armour, which, completely, inhibited, the, movement, of, the, rider, in, its, latest, forms, resembling, an, armour, shaped, cabin, integrated, into, the, horse, armour, more, than, a, functional, suit, of, armour, such, forms, of, sportive, equipment, during, the, final, phase, of, the, joust, in, 16th, century, germany, gave, rise, to, modern, misconceptions, about, the, heaviness, or, clumsiness, of, medieval, armour, as, notably, popularised, by, mark, twain, s, a, connecticut, yankee, in, king, arthur, s, court, the, extremely, heavy, helmets, of, the, stechzeug, are, explained, by, the, fact, that, the, aim, was, to, detach, the, crest, of, the, opponent, s, helmet, resulting, in, frequent, full, impact, of, the, lance, to, the, helmet, by, contrast, the, rennen, was, a, type, of, joust, with, lighter, contact, here, the, aim, was, to, hit, the, opponent, s, shield, the, specialised, rennzeug, was, developed, on, the, request, of, maximilian, who, desired, a, return, to, a, more, agile, form, of, joust, compared, to, the, heavily, armoured, full, contact, stechen, in, the, rennzeug, the, shield, was, attached, to, the, armour, with, a, mechanism, of, springs, and, would, detach, itself, upon, contact, plate, armour, was, widely, used, by, most, armies, until, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, for, both, foot, and, mounted, troops, such, as, the, cuirassiers, london, lobsters, dragoons, demi, lancers, and, polish, hussars, the, infantry, armour, of, the, 16th, century, developed, into, the, savoyard, type, of, three, quarters, armour, by, 1600, full, plate, armour, was, expensive, to, produce, and, remained, therefore, restricted, to, the, upper, strata, of, society, lavishly, decorated, suits, of, armour, remained, the, fashion, with, 18th, century, nobles, and, generals, long, after, they, had, ceased, to, be, militarily, useful, on, the, battlefield, due, to, the, advent, of, inexpensive, muskets, the, development, of, powerful, firearms, made, all, but, the, finest, and, heaviest, armour, obsolete, the, increasing, power, and, availability, of, firearms, and, the, nature, of, large, state, supported, infantry, led, to, more, portions, of, plate, armour, being, cast, off, in, favour, of, cheaper, more, mobile, troops, leg, protection, was, the, first, part, to, go, replaced, by, tall, leather, boots, by, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, only, field, marshals, commanders, and, royalty, remained, in, full, armour, on, the, battlefield, more, as, a, sign, of, rank, than, for, practical, considerations, it, remained, fashionable, for, monarchs, to, be, portrayed, in, armour, during, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, late, baroque, period, but, even, this, tradition, became, obsolete, thus, a, portrait, of, frederick, the, great, in, 1739, still, shows, him, in, armour, while, a, later, painting, showing, him, as, a, commander, in, the, seven, years, war, c, 1760, depicts, him, without, armour, body, armour, made, a, brief, reappearance, in, the, american, civil, war, with, mixed, success, during, world, war, i, both, sides, experimented, with, shrapnel, armour, and, some, soldiers, used, their, own, dedicated, ballistic, armour, such, as, the, american, brewster, body, shield, although, none, were, widely, produced, the, heavy, cavalry, armour, cuirass, used, by, the, german, british, and, french, empires, during, the, napoleonic, wars, were, actively, used, until, the, first, few, months, of, world, war, i, when, french, cuirassiers, went, to, meet, the, enemy, dressed, in, armour, outside, of, paris, the, cuirass, represents, the, final, stage, of, the, tradition, of, plate, armour, descended, from, the, late, middle, ages, meanwhile, makeshift, steel, armour, for, protection, against, shrapnel, and, early, forms, of, ballistic, vests, began, development, from, the, mid, 19th, century, to, the, present, day, plate, armour, was, also, famously, used, in, australia, by, the, kelly, gang, a, group, of, four, bushrangers, led, by, edward, ned, kelly, who, had, constructed, four, suits, of, improvised, armour, from, plough, mouldboards, and, whose, crime, spree, culminated, with, a, violent, shootout, with, police, at, the, town, of, glenrowan, in, 1880, the, armour, was, reasonably, effective, against, bullets, and, made, kelly, seem, almost, invincible, to, the, policemen, who, likened, him, to, an, evil, spirit, or, bunyip, with, one, constable, reporting, that, fired, at, him, point, blank, and, hit, him, straight, in, the, body, but, there, is, no, use, firing, at, ned, kelly, he, can, t, be, hurt, however, it, left, sections, of, the, groin, and, limbs, exposed, during, the, infamous, glenrowan, affair, gang, member, joe, byrne, was, killed, by, a, bullet, to, the, groin, kelly, was, captured, after, a, fifteen, minute, last, stand, against, police, having, sustained, a, total, of, 28, bullet, wounds, over, his, body, and, the, remaining, two, members, are, thought, to, have, committed, suicide, shortly, after, although, the, recovered, suits, were, almost, immediately, mismatched, they, have, since, been, reorganized, and, restored, and, today, remain, as, a, powerful, symbol, of, the, australian, outback, in, 1916, general, adrian, of, the, french, army, provided, an, abdominal, shield, which, was, light, in, weight, approx, one, kilogram, and, easy, to, wear, a, number, of, british, officers, recognised, that, many, casualties, could, be, avoided, if, effective, armour, were, available, the, first, usage, of, the, term, flak, jacket, refers, to, the, armour, originally, developed, by, the, wilkinson, sword, company, during, world, war, ii, to, help, protect, royal, air, force, raf, air, personnel, from, flying, debris, and, shrapnel, the, red, army, also, made, use, of, ballistic, steel, body, armour, typically, chestplates, for, combat, engineers, and, assault, infantry, after, world, war, ii, steel, plates, were, soon, replaced, by, vests, made, from, synthetic, fibre, in, the, 1950s, made, of, either, boron, carbide, silicon, carbide, or, aluminium, oxide, they, were, issued, to, the, crew, of, low, flying, aircraft, such, as, the, uh, 1, and, uc, 123, during, the, vietnam, war, the, synthetic, fibre, kevlar, was, introduced, in, 1971, and, most, ballistic, vests, since, the, 1970s, are, based, on, kevlar, optionally, with, the, addition, of, trauma, plates, to, reduce, the, risk, of, blunt, trauma, injury, such, plates, may, be, made, of, ceramic, metal, steel, or, titanium, or, synthetic, materials
