a, solar, cell, or, photovoltaic, cell, pv, cell, is, an, electronic, device, that, converts, the, energy, of, light, directly, into, electricity, by, means, of, the, photovoltaic, effect, it, is, a, form, of, photoelectric, cell, a, device, whose, electrical, characteristics, such, as, current, voltage, or, resistance, vary, when, it, is, exposed, to, light, individual, solar, cell, devices, are, often, the, electrical, building, blocks, of, photovoltaic, modules, known, colloquially, as, solar, panels, almost, all, commercial, pv, cells, consist, of, crystalline, silicon, with, a, market, share, of, 95, cadmium, telluride, thin, film, solar, cells, account, for, the, remainder, the, common, single, junction, silicon, solar, cell, can, produce, a, maximum, open, circuit, voltage, of, approximately, 0, 5, to, 0, 6, volts, photovoltaic, cells, may, operate, under, sunlight, or, artificial, light, in, addition, to, producing, energy, they, can, be, used, as, a, photodetector, for, example, infrared, detectors, detecting, light, or, other, electromagnetic, radiation, near, the, visible, range, or, measuring, light, intensity, the, operation, of, a, pv, cell, requires, three, basic, attributes, in, contrast, a, solar, thermal, collector, supplies, heat, by, absorbing, sunlight, for, the, purpose, of, either, direct, heating, or, indirect, electrical, power, generation, from, heat, a, photoelectrolytic, cell, photoelectrochemical, cell, on, the, other, hand, refers, either, to, a, type, of, photovoltaic, cell, like, that, developed, by, edmond, becquerel, and, modern, dye, sensitized, solar, cells, or, to, a, device, that, splits, water, directly, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, using, only, solar, illumination, photovoltaic, cells, and, solar, collectors, are, the, two, means, of, producing, solar, power, assemblies, of, solar, cells, are, used, to, make, solar, modules, that, generate, electrical, power, from, sunlight, as, distinguished, from, a, solar, thermal, module, or, solar, hot, water, panel, a, solar, array, generates, solar, power, using, solar, energy, application, of, solar, cells, as, an, alternative, energy, source, for, vehicular, applications, is, a, growing, industry, electric, vehicles, that, operate, off, of, solar, energy, and, or, sunlight, are, commonly, referred, to, as, solar, cars, these, vehicles, use, solar, panels, to, convert, absorbed, light, into, electrical, energy, that, is, then, stored, in, batteries, there, are, multiple, input, factors, that, affect, the, output, power, of, solar, cells, such, as, temperature, material, properties, weather, conditions, solar, irradiance, and, more, the, first, instance, of, photovoltaic, cells, within, vehicular, applications, was, around, midway, through, the, second, half, of, the, 1900, s, in, an, effort, to, increase, publicity, and, awareness, in, solar, powered, transportation, hans, tholstrup, decided, to, set, up, the, first, edition, of, the, world, solar, challenge, in, 1987, it, was, a, 3000, km, race, across, the, australian, outback, where, competitors, from, industry, research, groups, and, top, universities, around, the, globe, were, invited, to, compete, general, motors, ended, up, winning, the, event, by, a, significant, margin, with, their, sunraycer, vehicle, that, achieved, speeds, of, over, 40, mph, contrary, to, popular, belief, however, solar, powered, cars, are, one, of, the, oldest, alternative, energy, vehicles, current, solar, vehicles, harness, energy, from, the, sun, via, solar, panels, which, are, a, collected, group, of, solar, cells, working, in, tandem, towards, a, common, goal, these, solid, state, devices, use, quantum, mechanical, transitions, in, order, to, convert, a, given, amount, of, solar, power, into, electrical, power, the, electricity, produced, as, a, result, is, then, stored, in, the, vehicle, s, battery, in, order, to, run, the, motor, of, the, vehicle, batteries, in, solar, powered, vehicles, differ, from, those, in, standard, ice, cars, because, they, are, fashioned, in, a, way, to, impart, more, power, towards, the, electrical, components, of, the, vehicle, for, a, longer, duration, multiple, solar, cells, in, an, integrated, group, all, oriented, in, one, plane, constitute, a, solar, photovoltaic, panel, or, module, photovoltaic, modules, often, have, a, sheet, of, glass, on, the, sun, facing, side, allowing, light, to, pass, while, protecting, the, semiconductor, wafers, solar, cells, are, usually, connected, in, series, creating, additive, voltage, connecting, cells, in, parallel, yields, a, higher, current, however, problems, in, paralleled, cells, such, as, shadow, effects, can, shut, down, the, weaker, less, illuminated, parallel, string, a, number, of, series, connected, cells, causing, substantial, power, loss, and, possible, damage, because, of, the, reverse, bias, applied, to, the, shadowed, cells, by, their, illuminated, partners, although, modules, can, be, interconnected, to, create, an, array, with, the, desired, peak, dc, voltage, and, loading, current, capacity, which, can, be, done, with, or, without, using, independent, mppts, maximum, power, point, trackers, or, specific, to, each, module, with, or, without, module, level, power, electronic, mlpe, units, such, as, microinverters, or, dc, dc, optimizers, shunt, diodes, can, reduce, shadowing, power, loss, in, arrays, with, series, parallel, connected, cells, by, 2020, the, united, states, cost, per, watt, for, a, utility, scale, system, had, declined, to, 0, 94, the, photovoltaic, effect, was, experimentally, demonstrated, first, by, french, physicist, edmond, becquerel, in, 1839, at, age, 19, he, built, the, world, s, first, photovoltaic, cell, in, his, father, s, laboratory, willoughby, smith, first, described, the, effect, of, light, on, selenium, during, the, passage, of, an, electric, current, in, a, 20, february, 1873, issue, of, nature, in, 1883, charles, fritts, built, the, first, solid, state, photovoltaic, cell, by, coating, the, semiconductor, selenium, with, a, thin, layer, of, gold, to, form, the, junctions, the, device, was, only, around, 1, efficient, other, milestones, include, solar, cells, were, first, used, in, a, prominent, application, when, they, were, proposed, and, flown, on, the, vanguard, satellite, in, 1958, as, an, alternative, power, source, to, the, primary, battery, power, source, by, adding, cells, to, the, outside, of, the, body, the, mission, time, could, be, extended, with, no, major, changes, to, the, spacecraft, or, its, power, systems, in, 1959, the, united, states, launched, explorer, 6, featuring, large, wing, shaped, solar, arrays, which, became, a, common, feature, in, satellites, these, arrays, consisted, of, 9600, hoffman, solar, cells, by, the, 1960s, solar, cells, were, and, still, are, the, main, power, source, for, most, earth, orbiting, satellites, and, a, number, of, probes, into, the, solar, system, since, they, offered, the, best, power, to, weight, ratio, however, this, success, was, possible, because, in, the, space, application, power, system, costs, could, be, high, because, space, users, had, few, other, power, options, and, were, willing, to, pay, for, the, best, possible, cells, the, space, power, market, drove, the, development, of, higher, efficiencies, in, solar, cells, up, until, the, national, science, foundation, research, applied, to, national, needs, program, began, to, push, development, of, solar, cells, for, terrestrial, applications, in, the, early, 1990s, the, technology, used, for, space, solar, cells, diverged, from, the, silicon, technology, used, for, terrestrial, panels, with, the, spacecraft, application, shifting, to, gallium, arsenide, based, iii, v, semiconductor, materials, which, then, evolved, into, the, modern, iii, v, multijunction, photovoltaic, cell, used, on, spacecraft, in, recent, years, research, has, moved, towards, designing, and, manufacturing, lightweight, flexible, and, highly, efficient, solar, cells, terrestrial, solar, cell, technology, generally, uses, photovoltaic, cells, that, are, laminated, with, a, layer, of, glass, for, strength, and, protection, space, applications, for, solar, cells, require, that, the, cells, and, arrays, are, both, highly, efficient, and, extremely, lightweight, some, newer, technology, implemented, on, satellites, are, multi, junction, photovoltaic, cells, which, are, composed, of, different, p, n, junctions, with, varying, bandgaps, in, order, to, utilize, a, wider, spectrum, of, the, sun, s, energy, additionally, large, satellites, require, the, use, of, large, solar, arrays, to, produce, electricity, these, solar, arrays, need, to, be, broken, down, to, fit, in, the, geometric, constraints, of, the, launch, vehicle, the, satellite, travels, on, before, being, injected, into, orbit, historically, solar, cells, on, satellites, consisted, of, several, small, terrestrial, panels, folded, together, these, small, panels, would, be, unfolded, into, a, large, panel, after, the, satellite, is, deployed, in, its, orbit, newer, satellites, aim, to, use, flexible, rollable, solar, arrays, that, are, very, lightweight, and, can, be, packed, into, a, very, small, volume, the, smaller, size, and, weight, of, these, flexible, arrays, drastically, decreases, the, overall, cost, of, launching, a, satellite, due, to, the, direct, relationship, between, payload, weight, and, launch, cost, of, a, launch, vehicle, in, 2020, the, us, naval, research, laboratory, conducted, its, first, test, of, solar, power, generation, in, a, satellite, the, photovoltaic, radio, frequency, antenna, module, pram, experiment, aboard, the, boeing, x, 37, improvements, were, gradual, over, the, 1960s, this, was, also, the, reason, that, costs, remained, high, because, space, users, were, willing, to, pay, for, the, best, possible, cells, leaving, no, reason, to, invest, in, lower, cost, less, efficient, solutions, the, price, was, determined, largely, by, the, semiconductor, industry, their, move, to, integrated, circuits, in, the, 1960s, led, to, the, availability, of, larger, boules, at, lower, relative, prices, as, their, price, fell, the, price, of, the, resulting, cells, did, as, well, these, effects, lowered, 1971, cell, costs, to, some, 100, per, watt, in, late, 1969, elliot, berman, joined, exxon, s, task, force, which, was, looking, for, projects, 30, years, in, the, future, and, in, april, 1973, he, founded, solar, power, corporation, spc, a, wholly, owned, subsidiary, of, exxon, at, that, time, the, group, had, concluded, that, electrical, power, would, be, much, more, expensive, by, 2000, and, felt, that, this, increase, in, price, would, make, alternative, energy, sources, more, attractive, he, conducted, a, market, study, and, concluded, that, a, price, per, watt, of, about, 20, watt, would, create, significant, demand, the, team, eliminated, the, steps, of, polishing, the, wafers, and, coating, them, with, an, anti, reflective, layer, relying, on, the, rough, sawn, wafer, surface, the, team, also, replaced, the, expensive, materials, and, hand, wiring, used, in, space, applications, with, a, printed, circuit, board, on, the, back, acrylic, plastic, on, the, front, and, silicone, glue, between, the, two, potting, the, cells, solar, cells, could, be, made, using, cast, off, material, from, the, electronics, market, by, 1973, they, announced, a, product, and, spc, convinced, tideland, signal, to, use, its, panels, to, power, navigational, buoys, initially, for, the, u, s, coast, guard, research, into, solar, power, for, terrestrial, applications, became, prominent, with, the, u, s, national, science, foundation, s, advanced, solar, energy, research, and, development, division, within, the, research, applied, to, national, needs, program, which, ran, from, 1969, to, 1977, and, funded, research, on, developing, solar, power, for, ground, electrical, power, systems, a, 1973, conference, the, cherry, hill, conference, set, forth, the, technology, goals, required, to, achieve, this, goal, and, outlined, an, ambitious, project, for, achieving, them, kicking, off, an, applied, research, program, that, would, be, ongoing, for, several, decades, the, program, was, eventually, taken, over, by, the, energy, research, and, development, administration, erda, which, was, later, merged, into, the, u, s, department, of, energy, following, the, 1973, oil, crisis, oil, companies, used, their, higher, profits, to, start, or, buy, solar, firms, and, were, for, decades, the, largest, producers, exxon, arco, shell, amoco, later, purchased, by, bp, and, mobil, all, had, major, solar, divisions, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, technology, companies, also, participated, including, general, electric, motorola, ibm, tyco, and, rca, adjusting, for, inflation, it, cost, 96, per, watt, for, a, solar, module, in, the, mid, 1970s, process, improvements, and, a, very, large, boost, in, production, have, brought, that, figure, down, more, than, 99, to, 30, per, watt, in, 2018, and, as, low, as, 20, per, watt, in, 2020, swanson, s, law, is, an, observation, similar, to, moore, s, law, that, states, that, solar, cell, prices, fall, 20, for, every, doubling, of, industry, capacity, it, was, featured, in, an, article, in, the, british, weekly, newspaper, the, economist, in, late, 2012, balance, of, system, costs, were, then, higher, than, those, of, the, panels, large, commercial, arrays, could, be, built, as, of, 2018, at, below, 1, 00, a, watt, fully, commissioned, as, the, semiconductor, industry, moved, to, ever, larger, boules, older, equipment, became, inexpensive, cell, sizes, grew, as, equipment, became, available, on, the, surplus, market, arco, solar, s, original, panels, used, cells, 2, to, 4, inches, 50, to, 100, mm, in, diameter, panels, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, generally, used, 125, mm, wafers, since, 2008, almost, all, new, panels, use, 156, mm, cells, the, widespread, introduction, of, flat, screen, televisions, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, led, to, the, wide, availability, of, large, high, quality, glass, sheets, to, cover, the, panels, during, the, 1990s, polysilicon, poly, cells, became, increasingly, popular, these, cells, offer, less, efficiency, than, their, monosilicon, mono, counterparts, but, they, are, grown, in, large, vats, that, reduce, cost, by, the, mid, 2000s, poly, was, dominant, in, the, low, cost, panel, market, but, more, recently, the, mono, returned, to, widespread, use, manufacturers, of, wafer, based, cells, responded, to, high, silicon, prices, in, 2004, 2008, with, rapid, reductions, in, silicon, consumption, in, 2008, according, to, jef, poortmans, director, of, imec, s, organic, and, solar, department, current, cells, use, 8, 9, grams, 0, 28, 0, 32, oz, of, silicon, per, watt, of, power, generation, with, wafer, thicknesses, in, the, neighborhood, of, 200, microns, crystalline, silicon, panels, dominate, worldwide, markets, and, are, mostly, manufactured, in, china, and, taiwan, by, late, 2011, a, drop, in, european, demand, dropped, prices, for, crystalline, solar, modules, to, about, 1, 09, per, watt, down, sharply, from, 2010, prices, continued, to, fall, in, 2012, reaching, 0, 62, watt, by, 4q2012, solar, pv, is, growing, fastest, in, asia, with, china, and, japan, currently, accounting, for, half, of, worldwide, deployment, global, installed, pv, capacity, reached, at, least, 301, gigawatts, in, 2016, and, grew, to, supply, 1, 3, of, global, power, by, 2016, it, was, anticipated, that, electricity, from, pv, will, be, competitive, with, wholesale, electricity, costs, all, across, europe, and, the, energy, payback, time, of, crystalline, silicon, modules, can, be, reduced, to, below, 0, 5, years, by, 2020, falling, costs, are, considered, one, of, the, biggest, factors, in, the, rapid, growth, of, renewable, energy, with, the, cost, of, solar, photovoltaic, electricity, falling, by, 85, between, 2010, when, solar, and, wind, made, up, 1, 7, of, global, electricity, generation, and, 2021, where, they, made, up, 8, 7, in, 2019, solar, cells, accounted, for, 3, of, the, world, s, electricity, generation, solar, specific, feed, in, tariffs, vary, by, country, and, within, countries, such, tariffs, encourage, the, development, of, solar, power, projects, widespread, grid, parity, the, point, at, which, photovoltaic, electricity, is, equal, to, or, cheaper, than, grid, power, without, subsidies, likely, requires, advances, on, all, three, fronts, proponents, of, solar, hope, to, achieve, grid, parity, first, in, areas, with, abundant, sun, and, high, electricity, costs, such, as, in, california, and, japan, in, 2007, bp, claimed, grid, parity, for, hawaii, and, other, islands, that, otherwise, use, diesel, fuel, to, produce, electricity, george, w, bush, set, 2015, as, the, date, for, grid, parity, in, the, us, the, photovoltaic, association, reported, in, 2012, that, australia, had, reached, grid, parity, ignoring, feed, in, tariffs, the, price, of, solar, panels, fell, steadily, for, 40, years, interrupted, in, 2004, when, high, subsidies, in, germany, drastically, increased, demand, there, and, greatly, increased, the, price, of, purified, silicon, which, is, used, in, computer, chips, as, well, as, solar, panels, the, recession, of, 2008, and, the, onset, of, chinese, manufacturing, caused, prices, to, resume, their, decline, in, the, four, years, after, january, 2008, prices, for, solar, modules, in, germany, dropped, from, 3, to, 1, per, peak, watt, during, that, same, time, production, capacity, surged, with, an, annual, growth, of, more, than, 50, china, increased, market, share, from, 8, in, 2008, to, over, 55, in, the, last, quarter, of, 2010, in, december, 2012, the, price, of, chinese, solar, panels, had, dropped, to, 0, 60, wp, crystalline, modules, the, abbreviation, wp, stands, for, watt, peak, capacity, or, the, maximum, capacity, under, optimal, conditions, as, of, the, end, of, 2016, it, was, reported, that, spot, prices, for, assembled, solar, panels, not, cells, had, fallen, to, a, record, low, of, us, 0, 36, wp, the, second, largest, supplier, canadian, solar, inc, had, reported, costs, of, us, 0, 37, wp, in, the, third, quarter, of, 2016, having, dropped, 0, 02, from, the, previous, quarter, and, hence, was, probably, still, at, least, breaking, even, many, producers, expected, costs, would, drop, to, the, vicinity, of, 0, 30, by, the, end, of, 2017, it, was, also, reported, that, new, solar, installations, were, cheaper, than, coal, based, thermal, power, plants, in, some, regions, of, the, world, and, this, was, expected, to, be, the, case, in, most, of, the, world, within, a, decade, a, solar, cell, is, made, of, semiconducting, materials, such, as, silicon, that, have, been, fabricated, into, a, p, n, junction, such, junctions, are, made, by, doping, one, side, of, the, device, p, type, and, the, other, n, type, for, example, in, the, case, of, silicon, by, introducing, small, concentrations, of, boron, or, phosphorus, respectively, in, operation, photons, in, sunlight, hit, the, solar, cell, and, are, absorbed, by, the, semiconductor, when, the, photons, are, absorbed, electrons, are, excited, from, the, valence, band, to, the, conduction, band, or, from, occupied, to, unoccupied, molecular, orbitals, in, the, case, of, an, organic, solar, cell, producing, electron, hole, pairs, if, the, electron, hole, pairs, are, created, near, the, junction, between, p, type, and, n, type, materials, the, local, electric, field, sweeps, them, apart, to, opposite, electrodes, producing, an, excess, of, electrons, on, one, side, and, an, excess, of, holes, on, the, other, when, the, solar, cell, is, unconnected, or, the, external, electrical, load, is, very, high, the, electrons, and, holes, will, ultimately, restore, equilibrium, by, diffusing, back, across, the, junction, against, the, field, and, recombine, with, each, other, giving, off, heat, but, if, the, load, is, small, enough, then, it, is, easier, for, equilibrium, to, be, restored, by, the, excess, electrons, going, around, the, external, circuit, doing, useful, work, along, the, way, an, array, of, solar, cells, converts, solar, energy, into, a, usable, amount, of, direct, current, dc, electricity, an, inverter, can, convert, the, power, to, alternating, current, ac, the, most, commonly, known, solar, cell, is, configured, as, a, large, area, p, n, junction, made, from, silicon, other, possible, solar, cell, types, are, organic, solar, cells, dye, sensitized, solar, cells, perovskite, solar, cells, quantum, dot, solar, cells, etc, the, illuminated, side, of, a, solar, cell, generally, has, a, transparent, conducting, film, for, allowing, light, to, enter, into, the, active, material, and, to, collect, the, generated, charge, carriers, typically, films, with, high, transmittance, and, high, electrical, conductance, such, as, indium, tin, oxide, conducting, polymers, or, conducting, nanowire, networks, are, used, for, the, purpose, solar, cell, efficiency, may, be, broken, down, into, reflectance, efficiency, thermodynamic, efficiency, charge, carrier, separation, efficiency, and, conductive, efficiency, the, overall, efficiency, is, the, product, of, these, individual, metrics, the, power, conversion, efficiency, of, a, solar, cell, is, a, parameter, which, is, defined, by, the, fraction, of, incident, power, converted, into, electricity, a, solar, cell, has, a, voltage, dependent, efficiency, curve, temperature, coefficients, and, allowable, shadow, angles, due, to, the, difficulty, in, measuring, these, parameters, directly, other, parameters, are, substituted, thermodynamic, efficiency, quantum, efficiency, integrated, quantum, efficiency, v, oc, ratio, and, fill, factor, reflectance, losses, are, a, portion, of, quantum, efficiency, under, external, quantum, efficiency, recombination, losses, make, up, another, portion, of, quantum, efficiency, v, oc, ratio, and, fill, factor, resistive, losses, are, predominantly, categorized, under, fill, factor, but, also, make, up, minor, portions, of, quantum, efficiency, v, oc, ratio, the, fill, factor, is, the, ratio, of, the, actual, maximum, obtainable, power, to, the, product, of, the, open, circuit, voltage, and, short, circuit, current, this, is, a, key, parameter, in, evaluating, performance, in, 2009, typical, commercial, solar, cells, had, a, fill, factor, 0, 70, grade, b, cells, were, usually, between, 0, 4, and, 0, 7, cells, with, a, high, fill, factor, have, a, low, equivalent, series, resistance, and, a, high, equivalent, shunt, resistance, so, less, of, the, current, produced, by, the, cell, is, dissipated, in, internal, losses, single, p, n, junction, crystalline, silicon, devices, are, now, approaching, the, theoretical, limiting, power, efficiency, of, 33, 16, noted, as, the, shockley, queisser, limit, in, 1961, in, the, extreme, with, an, infinite, number, of, layers, the, corresponding, limit, is, 86, using, concentrated, sunlight, in, 2014,

solar, cells, that, include, amorphous, silicon, cdte, and, cigs, cells, and, are, commercially, significant, in, utility, scale, photovoltaic, power, stations, building, integrated, photovoltaics, or, in, small, stand, alone, power, system, the, third, generation, of, solar, cells, includes, a, number, of, thin, film, technologies, often, described, as, emerging, photovoltaics, most, of, them, have, not, yet, been, commercially, applied, and, are, still, in, the, research, or, development, phase, many, use, organic, materials, often, organometallic, compounds, as, well, as, inorganic, substances, despite, the, fact, that, their, efficiencies, had, been, low, and, the, stability, of, the, absorber, material, was, often, too, short, for, commercial, applications, there, is, research, into, these, technologies, as, they, promise, to, achieve, the, goal, of, producing, low, cost, high, efficiency, solar, cells, as, of, 2016, the, most, popular, and, efficient, solar, cells, were, those, made, from, thin, wafers, of, silicon, which, are, also, the, oldest, solar, cell, technology, by, far, the, most, prevalent, bulk, material, for, solar, cells, is, crystalline, silicon, c, si, also, known, as, solar, grade, silicon, bulk, silicon, is, separated, into, multiple, categories, according, to, crystallinity, and, crystal, size, in, the, resulting, ingot, ribbon, or, wafer, these, cells, are, entirely, based, around, the, concept, of, a, p, n, junction, solar, cells, made, of, c, si, are, made, from, wafers, between, 160, and, 240, micrometers, thick, monocrystalline, silicon, mono, si, solar, cells, feature, a, single, crystal, composition, that, enables, electrons, to, move, more, freely, than, in, a, multi, crystal, configuration, consequently, monocrystalline, solar, panels, deliver, a, higher, efficiency, than, their, multicrystalline, counterparts, the, corners, of, the, cells, look, clipped, like, an, octagon, because, the, wafer, material, is, cut, from, cylindrical, ingots, that, are, typically, grown, by, the, czochralski, process, solar, panels, using, mono, si, cells, display, a, distinctive, pattern, of, small, white, diamonds, epitaxial, wafers, of, crystalline, silicon, can, be, grown, on, a, monocrystalline, silicon, seed, wafer, by, chemical, vapor, deposition, cvd, and, then, detached, as, self, supporting, wafers, of, some, standard, thickness, e, g, 250, m, that, can, be, manipulated, by, hand, and, directly, substituted, for, wafer, cells, cut, from, monocrystalline, silicon, ingots, solar, cells, made, with, this, kerfless, technique, can, have, efficiencies, approaching, those, of, wafer, cut, cells, but, at, appreciably, lower, cost, if, the, cvd, can, be, done, at, atmospheric, pressure, in, a, high, throughput, inline, process, the, surface, of, epitaxial, wafers, may, be, textured, to, enhance, light, absorption, in, june, 2015, it, was, reported, that, heterojunction, solar, cells, grown, epitaxially, on, n, type, monocrystalline, silicon, wafers, had, reached, an, efficiency, of, 22, 5, over, a, total, cell, area, of, 243, 4, cm, 2, displaystyle, 2, polycrystalline, silicon, or, multicrystalline, silicon, multi, si, cells, are, made, from, cast, square, ingots, large, blocks, of, molten, silicon, carefully, cooled, and, solidified, they, consist, of, small, crystals, giving, the, material, its, typical, metal, flake, effect, polysilicon, cells, are, the, most, common, type, used, in, photovoltaics, and, are, less, expensive, but, also, less, efficient, than, those, made, from, monocrystalline, silicon, ribbon, silicon, is, a, type, of, polycrystalline, silicon, it, is, formed, by, drawing, flat, thin, films, from, molten, silicon, and, results, in, a, polycrystalline, structure, these, cells, are, cheaper, to, make, than, multi, si, due, to, a, great, reduction, in, silicon, waste, as, this, approach, does, not, require, sawing, from, ingots, however, they, are, also, less, efficient, this, form, was, developed, in, the, 2000s, and, introduced, commercially, around, 2009, also, called, cast, mono, this, design, uses, polycrystalline, casting, chambers, with, small, seeds, of, mono, material, the, result, is, a, bulk, mono, like, material, that, is, polycrystalline, around, the, outsides, when, sliced, for, processing, the, inner, sections, are, high, efficiency, mono, like, cells, but, square, instead, of, clipped, while, the, outer, edges, are, sold, as, conventional, poly, this, production, method, results, in, mono, like, cells, at, poly, like, prices, thin, film, technologies, reduce, the, amount, of, active, material, in, a, cell, most, designs, sandwich, active, material, between, two, panes, of, glass, since, silicon, solar, panels, only, use, one, pane, of, glass, thin, film, panels, are, approximately, twice, as, heavy, as, crystalline, silicon, panels, although, they, have, a, smaller, ecological, impact, determined, from, life, cycle, analysis, cadmium, telluride, is, the, only, thin, film, material, so, far, to, rival, crystalline, silicon, in, cost, watt, however, cadmium, is, highly, toxic, and, tellurium, anion, telluride, supplies, are, limited, the, cadmium, present, in, the, cells, would, be, toxic, if, released, however, release, is, impossible, during, normal, operation, of, the, cells, and, is, unlikely, during, fires, in, residential, roofs, a, square, meter, of, cdte, contains, approximately, the, same, amount, of, cd, as, a, single, c, cell, nickel, cadmium, battery, in, a, more, stable, and, less, soluble, form, copper, indium, gallium, selenide, cigs, is, a, direct, band, gap, material, it, has, the, highest, efficiency, 20, among, all, commercially, significant, thin, film, materials, see, cigs, solar, cell, traditional, methods, of, fabrication, involve, vacuum, processes, including, co, evaporation, and, sputtering, recent, developments, at, ibm, and, nanosolar, attempt, to, lower, the, cost, by, using, non, vacuum, solution, processes, silicon, thin, film, cells, are, mainly, deposited, by, chemical, vapor, deposition, typically, plasma, enhanced, pe, cvd, from, silane, gas, and, hydrogen, gas, depending, on, the, deposition, parameters, this, can, yield, amorphous, silicon, a, si, or, a, si, h, protocrystalline, silicon, or, nanocrystalline, silicon, nc, si, or, nc, si, h, also, called, microcrystalline, silicon, amorphous, silicon, is, the, most, well, developed, thin, film, technology, to, date, an, amorphous, silicon, a, si, solar, cell, is, made, of, non, crystalline, or, microcrystalline, silicon, amorphous, silicon, has, a, higher, bandgap, 1, 7, ev, than, crystalline, silicon, c, si, 1, 1, ev, which, means, it, absorbs, the, visible, part, of, the, solar, spectrum, more, strongly, than, the, higher, power, density, infrared, portion, of, the, spectrum, the, production, of, a, si, thin, film, solar, cells, uses, glass, as, a, substrate, and, deposits, a, very, thin, layer, of, silicon, by, plasma, enhanced, chemical, vapor, deposition, pecvd, protocrystalline, silicon, with, a, low, volume, fraction, of, nanocrystalline, silicon, is, optimal, for, high, open, circuit, voltage, nc, si, has, about, the, same, bandgap, as, c, si, and, nc, si, and, a, si, can, advantageously, be, combined, in, thin, layers, creating, a, layered, cell, called, a, tandem, cell, the, top, cell, in, a, si, absorbs, the, visible, light, and, leaves, the, infrared, part, of, the, spectrum, for, the, bottom, cell, in, nc, si, the, semiconductor, material, gallium, arsenide, gaas, is, also, used, for, single, crystalline, thin, film, solar, cells, although, gaas, cells, are, very, expensive, they, hold, the, world, s, record, in, efficiency, for, a, single, junction, solar, cell, at, 28, 8, typically, fabricated, on, crystalline, silicon, wafer, with, a, 41, fill, factor, by, moving, to, porous, silicon, fill, factor, can, be, increased, to, 56, with, potentially, reduced, cost, using, less, active, gaas, material, by, fabricating, nanowires, is, another, potential, pathway, to, cost, reduction, gaas, is, more, commonly, used, in, multijunction, photovoltaic, cells, for, concentrated, photovoltaics, cpv, hcpv, and, for, solar, panels, on, spacecraft, as, the, industry, favours, efficiency, over, cost, for, space, based, solar, power, based, on, the, previous, literature, and, some, theoretical, analysis, there, are, several, reasons, why, gaas, has, such, high, power, conversion, efficiency, first, gaas, bandgap, is, 1, 43ev, which, is, almost, ideal, for, solar, cells, second, because, gallium, is, a, by, product, of, the, smelting, of, other, metals, gaas, cells, are, relatively, insensitive, to, heat, and, it, can, keep, high, efficiency, when, temperature, is, quite, high, third, gaas, has, the, wide, range, of, design, options, using, gaas, as, active, layer, in, solar, cell, engineers, can, have, multiple, choices, of, other, layers, which, can, better, generate, electrons, and, holes, in, gaas, multi, junction, cells, consist, of, multiple, thin, films, each, essentially, a, solar, cell, grown, on, top, of, another, typically, using, metalorganic, vapour, phase, epitaxy, each, layer, has, a, different, band, gap, energy, to, allow, it, to, absorb, electromagnetic, radiation, over, a, different, portion, of, the, spectrum, multi, junction, cells, were, originally, developed, for, special, applications, such, as, satellites, and, space, exploration, but, are, now, used, increasingly, in, terrestrial, concentrator, photovoltaics, cpv, an, emerging, technology, that, uses, lenses, and, curved, mirrors, to, concentrate, sunlight, onto, small, highly, efficient, multi, junction, solar, cells, by, concentrating, sunlight, up, to, a, thousand, times, high, concentration, photovoltaics, hcpv, has, the, potential, to, outcompete, conventional, solar, pv, in, the, future, 21, 26, tandem, solar, cells, based, on, monolithic, series, connected, gallium, indium, phosphide, gainp, gallium, arsenide, gaas, and, germanium, ge, p, n, junctions, are, increasing, sales, despite, cost, pressures, between, december, 2006, and, december, 2007, the, cost, of, 4n, gallium, metal, rose, from, about, 350, per, kg, to, 680, per, kg, additionally, germanium, metal, prices, have, risen, substantially, to, 1000, 1200, per, kg, this, year, those, materials, include, gallium, 4n, 6n, and, 7n, ga, arsenic, 4n, 6n, and, 7n, and, germanium, pyrolitic, boron, nitride, pbn, crucibles, for, growing, crystals, and, boron, oxide, these, products, are, critical, to, the, entire, substrate, manufacturing, industry, a, triple, junction, cell, for, example, may, consist, of, the, semiconductors, gaas, ge, and, gainp, 2, triple, junction, gaas, solar, cells, were, used, as, the, power, source, of, the, dutch, four, time, world, solar, challenge, winners, nuna, in, 2003, 2005, and, 2007, and, by, the, dutch, solar, cars, solutra, 2005, twente, one, 2007, and, 21revolution, 2009, gaas, based, multi, junction, devices, are, the, most, efficient, solar, cells, to, date, on, 15, october, 2012, triple, junction, metamorphic, cells, reached, a, record, high, of, 44, in, 2022, researchers, at, fraunhofer, institute, for, solar, energy, systems, ise, in, freiburg, germany, demonstrated, a, record, solar, cell, efficiency, of, 47, 6, under, 665, fold, sunlight, concentration, with, a, four, junction, concentrator, solar, cell, in, 2016, a, new, approach, was, described, for, producing, hybrid, photovoltaic, wafers, combining, the, high, efficiency, of, iii, v, multi, junction, solar, cells, with, the, economies, and, wealth, of, experience, associated, with, silicon, the, technical, complications, involved, in, growing, the, iii, v, material, on, silicon, at, the, required, high, temperatures, a, subject, of, study, for, some, 30, years, are, avoided, by, epitaxial, growth, of, silicon, on, gaas, at, low, temperature, by, plasma, enhanced, chemical, vapor, deposition, pecvd, si, single, junction, solar, cells, have, been, widely, studied, for, decades, and, are, reaching, their, practical, efficiency, of, 26, under, 1, sun, conditions, increasing, this, efficiency, may, require, adding, more, cells, with, bandgap, energy, larger, than, 1, 1, ev, to, the, si, cell, allowing, to, convert, short, wavelength, photons, for, generation, of, additional, voltage, a, dual, junction, solar, cell, with, a, band, gap, of, 1, 6, 1, 8, ev, as, a, top, cell, can, reduce, thermalization, loss, produce, a, high, external, radiative, efficiency, and, achieve, theoretical, efficiencies, over, 45, a, tandem, cell, can, be, fabricated, by, growing, the, gainp, and, si, cells, growing, them, separately, can, overcome, the, 4, lattice, constant, mismatch, between, si, and, the, most, common, iii, v, layers, that, prevent, direct, integration, into, one, cell, the, two, cells, therefore, are, separated, by, a, transparent, glass, slide, so, the, lattice, mismatch, does, not, cause, strain, to, the, system, this, creates, a, cell, with, four, electrical, contacts, and, two, junctions, that, demonstrated, an, efficiency, of, 18, 1, with, a, fill, factor, ff, of, 76, 2, the, si, bottom, cell, reaches, an, efficiency, of, 11, 7, 0, 4, in, the, tandem, device, resulting, in, a, cumulative, tandem, cell, efficiency, of, 29, 8, this, efficiency, exceeds, the, theoretical, limit, of, 29, 4, and, the, record, experimental, efficiency, value, of, a, si, 1, sun, solar, cell, and, is, also, higher, than, the, record, efficiency, 1, sun, gaas, device, however, using, a, gaas, substrate, is, expensive, and, not, practical, hence, researchers, try, to, make, a, cell, with, two, electrical, contact, points, and, one, junction, which, does, not, need, a, gaas, substrate, this, means, there, will, be, direct, integration, of, gainp, and, si, perovskite, solar, cells, are, solar, cells, that, include, a, perovskite, structured, material, as, the, active, layer, most, commonly, this, is, a, solution, processed, hybrid, organic, inorganic, tin, or, lead, halide, based, material, efficiencies, have, increased, from, below, 5, at, their, first, usage, in, 2009, to, 25, 5, in, 2020, making, them, a, very, rapidly, advancing, technology, and, a, hot, topic, in, the, solar, cell, field, researchers, at, university, of, rochester, reported, in, 2023, that, significant, further, improvements, in, cell, efficiency, can, be, achieved, by, utilizing, purcell, effect, perovskite, solar, cells, are, also, forecast, to, be, extremely, cheap, to, scale, up, making, them, a, very, attractive, option, for, commercialisation, so, far, most, types, of, perovskite, solar, cells, have, not, reached, sufficient, operational, stability, to, be, commercialised, although, many, research, groups, are, investigating, ways, to, solve, this, energy, and, environmental, sustainability, of, perovskite, solar, cells, and, tandem, perovskite, are, shown, to, be, dependent, on, the, structures, photonic, front, contacts, for, light, management, can, improve, the, perovskite, cells, performance, via, enhanced, broadband, absorption, while, allowing, better, operational, stability, due, to, protection, against, the, harmful, high, energy, above, visible, radiation, the, inclusion, of, the, toxic, element, lead, in, the, most, efficient, perovskite, solar, cells, is, a, potential, problem, for, commercialisation, with, a, transparent, rear, side, bifacial, solar, cells, can, absorb, light, from, both, the, front, and, rear, sides, hence, they, can, produce, more, electricity, than, conventional, monofacial, solar, cells, the, first, patent, of, bifacial, solar, cells, was, filed, by, japanese, researcher, hiroshi, mori, in, 1966, later, it, is, said, that, russia, was, the, first, to, deploy, bifacial, solar, cells, in, their, space, program, in, the, 1970s, in, 1976, the, institute, for, solar, energy, of, the, technical, university, of, madrid, began, a, research, program, for, the, development, of, bifacial, solar, cells, led, by, prof, antonio, luque, based, on, 1977, us, and, spanish, patents, by, luque, a, practical, bifacial, cell, was, proposed, with, a, front, face, as, anode, and, a, rear, face, as, cathode, in, previously, reported, proposals, and, attempts, both, faces, were, anodic, and, interconnection, between, cells, was, complicated, and, expensive, in, 1980, andr, s, cuevas, a, phd, student, in, luque, s, team, demonstrated, experimentally, a, 50, increase, in, output, power, of, bifacial, solar, cells, relative, to, identically, oriented, and, tilted, monofacial, ones, when, a, white, background, was, provided, in, 1981, the, company, isofoton, was, founded, in, m, laga, to, produce, the, developed, bifacial, cells, thus, becoming, the, first, industrialization, of, this, pv, cell, technology, with, an, initial, production, capacity, of, 300, kw, yr, of, bifacial, solar, cells, early, landmarks, of, isofoton, s, production, were, the, 20kwp, power, plant, in, san, agust, n, de, guadalix, built, in, 1986, for, iberdrola, and, an, off, grid, installation, by, 1988, also, of, 20kwp, in, the, village, of, noto, gouye, diama, senegal, funded, by, the, spanish, international, aid, and, cooperation, programs, due, to, the, reduced, manufacturing, cost, companies, have, again, started, to, produce, commercial, bifacial, modules, since, 2010, by, 2017, there, were, at, least, eight, certified, pv, manufacturers, providing, bifacial, modules, in, north, america, the, international, technology, roadmap, for, photovoltaics, itrpv, predicted, that, the, global, market, share, of, bifacial, technology, will, expand, from, less, than, 5, in, 2016, to, 30, in, 2027, due, to, the, significant, interest, in, the, bifacial, technology, a, recent, study, has, investigated, the, performance, and, optimization, of, bifacial, solar, modules, worldwide, the, results, indicate, that, across, the, globe, ground, mounted, bifacial, modules, can, only, offer, 10, gain, in, annual, electricity, yields, compared, to, the, monofacial, counterparts, for, a, ground, albedo, coefficient, of, 25, typical, for, concrete, and, vegetation, groundcovers, however, the, gain, can, be, increased, to, 30, by, elevating, the, module, 1, m, above, the, ground, and, enhancing, the, ground, albedo, coefficient, to, 50, sun, et, al, also, derived, a, set, of, empirical, equations, that, can, optimize, bifacial, solar, modules, analytically, in, addition, there, is, evidence, that, bifacial, panels, work, better, than, traditional, panels, in, snowy, environments, as, bifacials, on, dual, axis, trackers, made, 14, more, electricity, in, a, year, than, their, monofacial, counterparts, and, 40, during, the, peak, winter, months, an, online, simulation, tool, is, available, to, model, the, performance, of, bifacial, modules, in, any, arbitrary, location, across, the, entire, world, it, can, also, optimize, bifacial, modules, as, a, function, of, tilt, angle, azimuth, angle, and, elevation, above, the, ground, intermediate, band, photovoltaics, in, solar, cell, research, provides, methods, for, exceeding, the, shockley, queisser, limit, on, the, efficiency, of, a, cell, it, introduces, an, intermediate, band, ib, energy, level, in, between, the, valence, and, conduction, bands, theoretically, introducing, an, ib, allows, two, photons, with, energy, less, than, the, bandgap, to, excite, an, electron, from, the, valence, band, to, the, conduction, band, this, increases, the, induced, photocurrent, and, thereby, efficiency, luque, and, marti, first, derived, a, theoretical, limit, for, an, ib, device, with, one, midgap, energy, level, using, detailed, balance, they, assumed, no, carriers, were, collected, at, the, ib, and, that, the, device, was, under, full, concentration, they, found, the, maximum, efficiency, to, be, 63, 2, for, a, bandgap, of, 1, 95ev, with, the, ib, 0, 71ev, from, either, the, valence, or, conduction, band, under, one, sun, illumination, the, limiting, efficiency, is, 47, several, means, are, under, study, to, realize, ib, semiconductors, with, such, optimum, 3, bandgap, configuration, namely, via, materials, engineering, controlled, inclusion, of, deep, level, impurities, or, highly, mismatched, alloys, and, nano, structuring, quantum, dots, in, host, hetero, crystals, in, 2014, researchers, at, california, nanosystems, institute, discovered, using, kesterite, and, perovskite, improved, electric, power, conversion, efficiency, for, solar, cells, in, december, 2022, it, was, reported, that, mit, researchers, had, developed, ultralight, fabric, solar, cells, these, cells, offer, a, weight, one, hundredth, that, of, traditional, panels, while, generating, 18, times, more, power, per, kilogram, thinner, than, a, human, hair, these, cells, can, be, laminated, onto, various, surfaces, such, as, boat, sails, tents, tarps, or, drone, wings, to, extend, their, functionality, using, ink, based, materials, and, scalable, techniques, researchers, coat, the, solar, cell, structure, with, printable, electronic, inks, completing, the, module, with, screen, printed, electrodes, tested, on, high, strength, fabric, the, cells, produce, 370, watts, per, kilogram, representing, an, improvement, over, conventional, solar, cells, photon, upconversion, is, the, process, of, using, two, low, energy, e, g, infrared, photons, to, produce, one, higher, energy, photon, downconversion, is, the, process, of, using, one, high, energy, photon, e, g, ultraviolet, to, produce, two, lower, energy, photons, either, of, these, techniques, could, be, used, to, produce, higher, efficiency, solar, cells, by, allowing, solar, photons, to, be, more, efficiently, used, the, difficulty, however, is, that, the, conversion, efficiency, of, existing, phosphors, exhibiting, up, or, down, conversion, is, low, and, is, typically, narrow, band, one, upconversion, technique, is, to, incorporate, lanthanide, doped, materials, er, 3, yb, 3, ho, 3, or, a, combination, taking, advantage, of, their, luminescence, to, convert, infrared, radiation, to, visible, light, upconversion, process, occurs, when, two, infrared, photons, are, absorbed, by, rare, earth, ions, to, generate, a, high, energy, absorbable, photon, as, example, the, energy, transfer, upconversion, process, etu, consists, in, successive, transfer, processes, between, excited, ions, in, the, near, infrared, the, upconverter, material, could, be, placed, below, the, solar, cell, to, absorb, the, infrared, light, that, passes, through, the, silicon, useful, ions, are, most, commonly, found, in, the, trivalent, state, er, ions, have, been, the, most, used, er, 3, ions, absorb, solar, radiation, around, 1, 54, m, two, er, 3, ions, that, have, absorbed, this, radiation, can, interact, with, each, other, through, an, upconversion, process, the, excited, ion, emits, light, above, the, si, bandgap, that, is, absorbed, by, the, solar, cell, and, creates, an, additional, electron, hole, pair, that, can, generate, current, however, the, increased, efficiency, was, small, in, addition, fluoroindate, glasses, have, low, phonon, energy, and, have, been, proposed, as, suitable, matrix, doped, with, ho, 3, ions, dye, sensitized, solar, cells, dsscs, are, made, of, low, cost, materials, and, do, not, need, elaborate, manufacturing, equipment, so, they, can, be, made, in, a, diy, fashion, in, bulk, it, should, be, significantly, less, expensive, than, older, solid, state, cell, designs, dssc, s, can, be, engineered, into, flexible, sheets, and, although, its, conversion, efficiency, is, less, than, the, best, thin, film, cells, its, price, performance, ratio, may, be, high, enough, to, allow, them, to, compete, with, fossil, fuel, electrical, generation, typically, a, ruthenium, metalorganic, dye, ru, centered, is, used, as, a, monolayer, of, light, absorbing, material, which, is, adsorbed, onto, a, thin, film, of, titanium, dioxide, the, dye, sensitized, solar, cell, depends, on, this, mesoporous, layer, of, nanoparticulate, titanium, dioxide, tio, 2, to, greatly, amplify, the, surface, area, 200, 300, m, 2, g, tio, 2, as, compared, to, approximately, 10, m, 2, g, of, flat, single, crystal, which, allows, for, a, greater, number, of, dyes, per, solar, cell, area, which, in, term, in, increases, the, current, the, photogenerated, electrons, from, the, light, absorbing, dye, are, passed, on, to, the, n, type, tio, 2, and, the, holes, are, absorbed, by, an, electrolyte, on, the, other, side, of, the, dye, the, circuit, is, completed, by, a, redox, couple, in, the, electrolyte, which, can, be, liquid, or, solid, this, type, of, cell, allows, more, flexible, use, of, materials, and, is, typically, manufactured, by, screen, printing, or, ultrasonic, nozzles, with, the, potential, for, lower, processing, costs, than, those, used, for, bulk, solar, cells, however, the, dyes, in, these, cells, also, suffer, from, degradation, under, heat, and, uv, light, and, the, cell, casing, is, difficult, to, seal, due, to, the, solvents, used, in, assembly, due, to, this, reason, researchers, have, developed, solid, state, dye, sensitized, solar, cells, that, use, a, solid, electrolyte, to,
