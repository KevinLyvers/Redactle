object, oriented, programming, oop, is, a, programming, paradigm, based, on, the, concept, of, objects, which, can, contain, data, and, code, data, in, the, form, of, fields, often, known, as, attributes, or, properties, and, code, in, the, form, of, procedures, often, known, as, methods, in, oop, computer, programs, are, designed, by, making, them, out, of, objects, that, interact, with, one, another, many, of, the, most, widely, used, programming, languages, such, as, c, java, and, python, are, multi, paradigm, and, support, object, oriented, programming, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, typically, in, combination, with, imperative, programming, procedural, programming, and, functional, programming, significant, object, oriented, languages, include, ada, actionscript, c, common, lisp, c, dart, eiffel, fortran, 2003, haxe, java, kotlin, logo, matlab, objective, c, object, pascal, perl, php, python, r, raku, ruby, scala, simscript, simula, smalltalk, swift, vala, and, visual, basic, net, terminology, invoking, objects, in, the, modern, sense, of, object, oriented, programming, made, its, first, appearance, at, the, artificial, intelligence, group, at, mit, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, object, referred, to, lisp, atoms, with, identified, properties, attributes, another, early, mit, example, was, sketchpad, created, by, ivan, sutherland, in, 1960, 1961, in, the, glossary, of, the, 1963, technical, report, based, on, his, dissertation, about, sketchpad, sutherland, defined, notions, of, object, and, instance, with, the, class, concept, covered, by, master, or, definition, albeit, specialized, to, graphical, interaction, also, in, 1968, an, mit, algol, version, aed, 0, established, a, direct, link, between, data, structures, plexes, in, that, dialect, and, procedures, prefiguring, what, were, later, termed, messages, methods, and, member, functions, topics, such, as, data, abstraction, and, modular, programming, were, common, points, of, discussion, at, this, time, independently, of, later, mit, work, such, as, aed, simula, was, developed, during, the, years, 1961, 1967, simula, introduced, important, concepts, that, are, today, an, essential, part, of, object, oriented, programming, such, as, class, and, object, inheritance, and, dynamic, binding, the, object, oriented, simula, programming, language, was, used, mainly, by, researchers, involved, with, physical, modelling, such, as, models, to, study, and, improve, the, movement, of, ships, and, their, content, through, cargo, ports, i, thought, of, objects, being, like, biological, cells, and, or, individual, computers, on, a, network, only, able, to, communicate, with, messages, so, messaging, came, at, the, very, beginning, it, took, a, while, to, see, how, to, do, messaging, in, a, programming, language, efficiently, enough, to, be, useful, alan, kay, influenced, by, the, work, at, mit, and, the, simula, language, in, november, 1966, alan, kay, began, working, on, ideas, that, would, eventually, be, incorporated, into, the, smalltalk, programming, language, kay, used, the, term, object, oriented, programming, in, conversation, as, early, as, 1967, although, sometimes, called, the, father, of, object, oriented, programming, alan, kay, has, differentiated, his, notion, of, oo, from, the, more, conventional, abstract, data, type, notion, of, object, and, has, implied, that, the, computer, science, establishment, did, not, adopt, his, notion, a, 1976, mit, memo, co, authored, by, barbara, liskov, lists, simula, 67, clu, and, alphard, as, object, oriented, languages, but, does, not, mention, smalltalk, in, the, 1970s, the, first, version, of, the, smalltalk, programming, language, was, developed, at, xerox, parc, by, alan, kay, dan, ingalls, and, adele, goldberg, smalltalk, 72, included, a, programming, environment, and, was, dynamically, typed, and, at, first, was, interpreted, not, compiled, smalltalk, became, noted, for, its, application, of, object, orientation, at, the, language, level, and, its, graphical, development, environment, smalltalk, went, through, various, versions, and, interest, in, the, language, grew, while, smalltalk, was, influenced, by, the, ideas, introduced, in, simula, 67, it, was, designed, to, be, a, fully, dynamic, system, in, which, classes, could, be, created, and, modified, dynamically, during, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, object, oriented, programming, rose, to, prominence, the, flavors, object, oriented, lisp, was, developed, starting, 1979, introducing, multiple, inheritance, and, mixins, in, 1981, goldberg, edited, the, august, issue, of, byte, magazine, introducing, smalltalk, and, object, oriented, programming, to, a, wide, audience, loops, the, object, system, for, interlisp, d, was, influenced, by, smalltalk, and, flavors, and, a, paper, about, it, was, published, in, 1982, in, 1986, the, association, for, computing, machinery, organized, the, first, conference, on, object, oriented, programming, systems, languages, and, applications, oopsla, which, was, attended, by, 1, 000, people, among, other, developments, was, the, common, lisp, object, system, which, integrates, functional, programming, and, object, oriented, programming, and, allows, extension, via, a, meta, object, protocol, in, the, 1980s, there, were, a, few, attempts, to, design, processor, architectures, that, included, hardware, support, for, objects, in, memory, but, these, were, not, successful, examples, include, the, intel, iapx, 432, and, the, linn, smart, rekursiv, in, the, mid, 1980s, objective, c, was, developed, by, brad, cox, who, had, used, smalltalk, at, itt, inc, bjarne, stroustrup, who, had, used, simula, for, his, phd, thesis, created, the, object, oriented, c, in, 1985, bertrand, meyer, also, produced, the, first, design, of, the, eiffel, language, focused, on, software, quality, eiffel, is, a, purely, object, oriented, programming, language, and, a, notation, supporting, the, entire, software, lifecycle, meyer, described, the, eiffel, software, development, method, based, on, a, small, number, of, key, ideas, from, software, engineering, and, computer, science, in, object, oriented, software, construction, essential, to, the, quality, focus, of, eiffel, is, meyer, s, reliability, mechanism, design, by, contract, which, is, an, integral, part, of, both, the, method, and, language, in, the, early, and, mid, 1990s, object, oriented, programming, developed, as, the, dominant, programming, paradigm, when, programming, languages, supporting, the, techniques, became, widely, available, these, included, visual, foxpro, 3, 0, c, and, delphi, its, dominance, was, further, enhanced, by, the, rising, popularity, of, graphical, user, interfaces, which, rely, heavily, upon, object, oriented, programming, techniques, an, example, of, a, closely, related, dynamic, gui, library, and, oop, language, can, be, found, in, the, cocoa, frameworks, on, mac, os, x, written, in, objective, c, an, object, oriented, dynamic, messaging, extension, to, c, based, on, smalltalk, oop, toolkits, also, enhanced, the, popularity, of, event, driven, programming, although, this, concept, is, not, limited, to, oop, at, eth, z, rich, niklaus, wirth, and, his, colleagues, investigated, the, concept, of, type, checking, across, module, boundaries, modula, 2, 1978, included, this, concept, and, their, succeeding, design, oberon, 1987, included, a, distinctive, approach, to, object, orientation, classes, and, such, inheritance, is, not, obvious, in, wirth, s, design, since, his, nomenclature, looks, in, the, opposite, direction, it, is, called, type, extension, and, the, viewpoint, is, from, the, parent, down, to, the, inheritor, object, oriented, features, have, been, added, to, many, previously, existing, languages, including, ada, basic, fortran, pascal, and, cobol, adding, these, features, to, languages, that, were, not, initially, designed, for, them, often, led, to, problems, with, compatibility, and, maintainability, of, code, more, recently, some, languages, have, emerged, that, are, primarily, object, oriented, but, that, are, also, compatible, with, procedural, methodology, two, such, languages, are, python, and, ruby, probably, the, most, commercially, important, recent, object, oriented, languages, are, java, developed, by, sun, microsystems, as, well, as, c, and, visual, basic, net, vb, net, both, designed, for, microsoft, s, net, platform, each, of, these, two, frameworks, shows, in, its, way, the, benefit, of, using, oop, by, creating, an, abstraction, from, implementation, vb, net, and, c, support, cross, language, inheritance, allowing, classes, defined, in, one, language, to, subclass, classes, defined, in, the, other, language, object, oriented, programming, uses, objects, but, not, all, of, the, associated, techniques, and, structures, are, supported, directly, in, languages, that, claim, to, support, oop, the, features, listed, below, are, common, among, languages, considered, to, be, strongly, class, and, object, oriented, or, multi, paradigm, with, oop, support, with, notable, exceptions, mentioned, christopher, j, date, stated, that, critical, comparison, of, oop, to, other, technologies, relational, in, particular, is, difficult, because, of, lack, of, an, agreed, upon, and, rigorous, definition, of, oop, modular, programming, support, provides, the, ability, to, group, procedures, into, files, and, modules, for, organizational, purposes, modules, are, namespaced, so, identifiers, in, one, module, will, not, conflict, with, a, procedure, or, variable, sharing, the, same, name, in, another, file, or, module, an, object, is, a, data, structure, or, abstract, data, type, containing, fields, state, variables, containing, data, and, methods, subroutines, or, procedures, defining, the, object, s, behavior, in, code, fields, may, also, be, known, as, members, attributes, or, properties, objects, are, typically, stored, as, contiguous, regions, of, memory, objects, are, accessed, somewhat, like, variables, with, complex, internal, structures, and, in, many, languages, are, effectively, pointers, serving, as, actual, references, to, a, single, instance, of, said, object, in, memory, within, a, heap, or, stack, objects, sometimes, correspond, to, things, found, in, the, real, world, for, example, a, graphics, program, may, have, objects, such, as, circle, square, and, menu, an, online, shopping, system, might, have, objects, such, as, shopping, cart, customer, and, product, sometimes, objects, represent, more, abstract, entities, like, an, object, that, represents, an, open, file, or, an, object, that, provides, the, service, of, translating, measurements, from, u, s, customary, to, metric, objects, can, contain, other, objects, in, their, instance, variables, this, is, known, as, object, composition, for, example, an, object, in, the, employee, class, might, contain, either, directly, or, through, a, pointer, an, object, in, the, address, class, in, addition, to, its, own, instance, variables, like, first, name, and, position, object, composition, is, used, to, represent, has, a, relationships, every, employee, has, an, address, so, every, employee, object, has, access, to, a, place, to, store, an, address, object, either, directly, embedded, within, itself, or, at, a, separate, location, addressed, via, a, pointer, date, and, darwen, have, proposed, a, theoretical, foundation, that, uses, oop, as, a, kind, of, customizable, type, system, to, support, rdbms, but, it, forbids, object, pointers, the, oop, paradigm, has, been, criticized, for, overemphasizing, the, use, of, objects, for, software, design, and, modeling, at, the, expense, of, other, important, aspects, computation, algorithms, for, example, rob, pike, has, said, that, oop, languages, frequently, shift, the, focus, from, data, structures, and, algorithms, to, types, steve, yegge, noted, that, as, opposed, to, functional, programming, object, oriented, programming, puts, the, nouns, first, and, foremost, why, would, you, go, to, such, lengths, to, put, one, part, of, speech, on, a, pedestal, why, should, one, kind, of, concept, take, precedence, over, another, it, s, not, as, if, oop, has, suddenly, made, verbs, less, important, in, the, way, we, actually, think, it, s, a, strangely, skewed, perspective, rich, hickey, creator, of, clojure, described, object, systems, as, overly, simplistic, models, of, the, real, world, he, emphasized, the, inability, of, oop, to, model, time, properly, which, is, getting, increasingly, problematic, as, software, systems, become, more, concurrent, alexander, stepanov, compares, object, orientation, unfavourably, to, generic, programming, i, find, oop, technically, unsound, it, attempts, to, decompose, the, world, in, terms, of, interfaces, that, vary, on, a, single, type, to, deal, with, the, real, problems, you, need, multisorted, algebras, families, of, interfaces, that, span, multiple, types, i, find, oop, philosophically, unsound, it, claims, that, everything, is, an, object, even, if, it, is, true, it, is, not, very, interesting, saying, that, everything, is, an, object, is, saying, nothing, at, all, oop, languages, are, diverse, but, typically, oop, languages, allow, inheritance, for, code, reuse, and, extensibility, in, the, form, of, either, classes, or, prototypes, these, forms, of, inheritance, are, significantly, different, but, analogous, terminology, is, used, to, define, the, concepts, of, object, and, instance, in, class, based, programming, the, most, popular, style, each, object, is, required, to, be, an, instance, of, a, particular, class, the, class, defines, the, data, format, or, type, including, member, variables, and, their, types, and, available, procedures, class, methods, or, member, functions, for, a, given, type, or, class, of, object, objects, are, created, by, calling, a, special, type, of, method, in, the, class, known, as, a, constructor, classes, may, inherit, from, other, classes, so, they, are, arranged, in, a, hierarchy, that, represents, is, a, type, of, relationships, for, example, class, employee, might, inherit, from, class, person, all, the, data, and, methods, available, to, the, parent, class, also, appear, in, the, child, class, with, the, same, names, for, example, class, person, might, define, variables, first, name, and, last, name, with, method, make, full, name, these, will, also, be, available, in, class, employee, which, might, add, the, variables, position, and, salary, it, is, guaranteed, that, all, instances, of, class, employee, will, have, the, same, variables, such, as, the, name, position, and, salary, procedures, and, variables, can, be, specific, to, either, the, class, or, the, instance, this, leads, to, the, following, terms, depending, on, the, definition, of, the, language, subclasses, may, or, may, not, be, able, to, override, the, methods, defined, by, superclasses, multiple, inheritance, is, allowed, in, some, languages, though, this, can, make, resolving, overrides, complicated, some, languages, have, special, support, for, other, concepts, like, traits, and, mixins, though, in, any, language, with, multiple, inheritance, a, mixin, is, simply, a, class, that, does, not, represent, an, is, a, type, of, relationship, mixins, are, typically, used, to, add, the, same, methods, to, multiple, classes, for, example, class, unicodeconversionmixin, might, provide, a, method, unicode, to, ascii, when, included, in, class, filereader, and, class, webpagescraper, which, do, not, share, a, common, parent, abstract, classes, cannot, be, instantiated, into, objects, they, exist, only, for, inheritance, into, other, concrete, classes, that, can, be, instantiated, in, java, the, final, keyword, can, be, used, to, prevent, a, class, from, being, subclassed, in, contrast, in, prototype, based, programming, objects, are, the, primary, entities, generally, the, concept, of, a, class, does, not, even, exist, rather, the, prototype, or, parent, of, an, object, is, just, another, object, to, which, the, object, is, linked, in, self, an, object, may, have, multiple, or, no, parents, but, in, the, most, popular, prototype, based, language, javascript, every, object, has, one, prototype, link, and, only, one, new, objects, can, be, created, based, on, already, existing, objects, chosen, as, their, prototype, you, may, call, two, different, objects, apple, and, orange, a, fruit, if, the, object, fruit, exists, and, both, apple, and, orange, have, fruit, as, their, prototype, the, idea, of, the, fruit, class, does, not, exist, explicitly, but, can, be, modeled, as, the, equivalence, class, of, the, objects, sharing, the, same, prototype, or, as, the, set, of, objects, satisfying, a, certain, interface, duck, typing, unlike, class, based, programming, it, is, typically, possible, in, prototype, based, languages, to, define, attributes, and, methods, not, shared, with, other, objects, for, example, the, attribute, sugar, content, may, be, defined, in, apple, but, not, orange, some, languages, like, go, do, not, support, inheritance, at, all, go, states, that, it, is, object, oriented, and, bjarne, stroustrup, author, of, c, has, stated, that, it, is, possible, to, do, oop, without, inheritance, the, doctrine, of, composition, over, inheritance, advocates, implementing, has, a, relationships, using, composition, instead, of, inheritance, for, example, instead, of, inheriting, from, class, person, class, employee, could, give, each, employee, object, an, internal, person, object, which, it, then, has, the, opportunity, to, hide, from, external, code, even, if, class, person, has, many, public, attributes, or, methods, delegation, is, another, language, feature, that, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, inheritance, rob, pike, has, criticized, the, oo, mindset, for, preferring, a, multilevel, type, hierarchy, with, layered, abstractions, to, a, three, line, lookup, table, he, has, called, object, oriented, programming, the, roman, numerals, of, computing, bob, martin, states, that, because, they, are, software, related, classes, do, not, necessarily, share, the, relationships, of, the, things, they, represent, it, is, the, responsibility, of, the, object, not, any, external, code, to, select, the, procedural, code, to, execute, in, response, to, a, method, call, typically, by, looking, up, the, method, at, run, time, in, a, table, associated, with, the, object, this, feature, is, known, as, dynamic, dispatch, if, the, call, variability, relies, on, more, than, the, single, type, of, the, object, on, which, it, is, called, i, e, at, least, one, other, parameter, object, is, involved, in, the, method, choice, one, speaks, of, multiple, dispatch, a, method, call, is, also, known, as, message, passing, it, is, conceptualized, as, a, message, the, name, of, the, method, and, its, input, parameters, being, passed, to, the, object, for, dispatch, dispatch, interacts, with, inheritance, if, a, method, is, not, present, in, a, given, object, or, class, the, dispatch, is, delegated, to, its, parent, object, or, class, and, so, on, going, up, the, chain, of, inheritance, data, abstraction, is, a, design, pattern, in, which, data, are, visible, only, to, semantically, related, functions, to, prevent, misuse, the, success, of, data, abstraction, leads, to, frequent, incorporation, of, data, hiding, as, a, design, principle, in, object, oriented, and, pure, functional, programming, similarly, encapsulation, prevents, external, code, from, being, concerned, with, the, internal, workings, of, an, object, this, facilitates, code, refactoring, for, example, allowing, the, author, of, the, class, to, change, how, objects, of, that, class, represent, their, data, internally, without, changing, any, external, code, as, long, as, public, method, calls, work, the, same, way, it, also, encourages, programmers, to, put, all, the, code, that, is, concerned, with, a, certain, set, of, data, in, the, same, class, which, organizes, it, for, easy, comprehension, by, other, programmers, encapsulation, is, a, technique, that, encourages, decoupling, in, object, oriented, programming, objects, provide, a, layer, which, can, be, used, to, separate, internal, from, external, code, and, implement, abstraction, and, encapsulation, external, code, can, only, use, an, object, by, calling, a, specific, instance, method, with, a, certain, set, of, input, parameters, reading, an, instance, variable, or, writing, to, an, instance, variable, a, program, may, create, many, instances, of, objects, as, it, runs, which, operate, independently, this, technique, it, is, claimed, allows, easy, re, use, of, the, same, procedures, and, data, definitions, for, different, sets, of, data, in, addition, to, potentially, mirroring, real, world, relationships, intuitively, rather, than, utilizing, database, tables, and, programming, subroutines, the, developer, utilizes, objects, the, user, may, be, more, familiar, with, objects, from, their, application, domain, these, claims, that, the, oop, paradigm, enhances, reusability, and, modularity, have, been, criticized, if, a, class, does, not, allow, calling, code, to, access, internal, object, data, and, permits, access, through, methods, only, this, is, also, a, form, of, information, hiding, some, languages, java, for, example, let, classes, enforce, access, restrictions, explicitly, for, example, denoting, internal, data, with, the, private, keyword, and, designating, methods, intended, for, use, by, code, outside, the, class, with, the, public, keyword, methods, may, also, be, designed, public, private, or, intermediate, levels, such, as, protected, which, allows, access, from, the, same, class, and, its, subclasses, but, not, objects, of, a, different, class, in, other, languages, like, python, this, is, enforced, only, by, convention, for, example, private, methods, may, have, names, that, start, with, an, underscore, in, c, swift, kotlin, languages, internal, keyword, permits, access, only, to, files, present, in, the, same, assembly, package, or, module, as, that, of, the, class, in, programming, languages, particularly, object, oriented, ones, the, emphasis, on, abstraction, is, vital, object, oriented, languages, extend, the, notion, of, type, to, incorporate, data, abstraction, highlighting, the, significance, of, restricting, access, to, internal, data, through, methods, eric, s, raymond, has, written, that, object, oriented, programming, languages, tend, to, encourage, thickly, layered, programs, that, destroy, transparency, raymond, compares, this, unfavourably, to, the, approach, taken, with, unix, and, the, c, programming, language, the, open, closed, principle, advocates, that, classes, and, functions, should, be, open, for, extension, but, closed, for, modification, luca, cardelli, has, claimed, that, oop, languages, have, extremely, poor, modularity, properties, with, respect, to, class, extension, and, modification, and, tend, to, be, extremely, complex, the, latter, point, is, reiterated, by, joe, armstrong, the, principal, inventor, of, erlang, who, is, quoted, as, saying, the, problem, with, object, oriented, languages, is, they, ve, got, all, this, implicit, environment, that, they, carry, around, with, them, you, wanted, a, banana, but, what, you, got, was, a, gorilla, holding, the, banana, and, the, entire, jungle, leo, brodie, has, suggested, a, connection, between, the, standalone, nature, of, objects, and, a, tendency, to, duplicate, code, in, violation, of, the, don, t, repeat, yourself, principle, of, software, development, subtyping, a, form, of, polymorphism, is, when, calling, code, can, be, independent, of, which, class, in, the, supported, hierarchy, it, is, operating, on, the, parent, class, or, one, of, its, descendants, meanwhile, the, same, operation, name, among, objects, in, an, inheritance, hierarchy, may, behave, differently, for, example, objects, of, the, type, circle, and, square, are, derived, from, a, common, class, called, shape, the, draw, function, for, each, type, of, shape, implements, what, is, necessary, to, draw, itself, while, calling, code, can, remain, indifferent, to, the, particular, type, of, shape, being, drawn, this, is, another, type, of, abstraction, that, simplifies, code, external, to, the, class, hierarchy, and, enables, strong, separation, of, concerns, a, common, feature, of, objects, is, that, methods, are, attached, to, them, and, can, access, and, modify, the, object, s, data, fields, in, this, brand, of, oop, there, is, usually, a, special, name, such, as, this, or, self, used, to, refer, to, the, current, object, in, languages, that, support, open, recursion, object, methods, can, call, other, methods, on, the, same, object, including, themselves, using, this, name, this, variable, is, late, bound, it, allows, a, method, defined, in, one, class, to, invoke, another, method, that, is, defined, later, in, some, subclass, thereof, simula, 1967, is, generally, accepted, as, being, the, first, language, with, the, primary, features, of, an, object, oriented, language, it, was, created, for, making, simulation, programs, in, which, what, came, to, be, called, objects, were, the, most, important, information, representation, smalltalk, 1972, to, 1980, is, another, early, example, and, the, one, with, which, much, of, the, theory, of, oop, was, developed, concerning, the, degree, of, object, orientation, the, following, distinctions, can, be, made, many, widely, used, languages, such, as, c, java, and, python, provide, object, oriented, features, although, in, the, past, object, oriented, programming, was, widely, accepted, more, recently, essays, criticizing, object, oriented, programming, and, recommending, the, avoidance, of, these, features, generally, in, favor, of, functional, programming, have, been, very, popular, in, the, developer, community, paul, graham, has, suggested, that, oop, s, popularity, within, large, companies, is, due, to, large, and, frequently, changing, groups, of, mediocre, programmers, according, to, graham, the, discipline, imposed, by, oop, prevents, any, one, programmer, from, doing, too, much, damage, eric, s, raymond, a, unix, programmer, and, open, source, software, advocate, has, been, critical, of, claims, that, present, object, oriented, programming, as, the, one, true, solution, richard, feldman, argues, that, these, languages, may, have, improved, their, modularity, by, adding, oo, features, but, they, became, popular, for, reasons, other, than, being, object, oriented, in, an, article, lawrence, krubner, claimed, that, compared, to, other, languages, lisp, dialects, functional, languages, etc, oop, languages, have, no, unique, strengths, and, inflict, a, heavy, burden, of, unneeded, complexity, a, study, by, potok, et, al, has, shown, no, significant, difference, in, productivity, between, oop, and, procedural, approaches, luca, cardelli, has, claimed, that, oop, code, is, intrinsically, less, efficient, than, procedural, code, and, that, oop, can, take, longer, to, compile, in, recent, years, object, oriented, programming, has, become, especially, popular, in, dynamic, programming, languages, python, powershell, ruby, and, groovy, are, dynamic, languages, built, on, oop, principles, while, perl, and, php, have, been, adding, object, oriented, features, since, perl, 5, and, php, 4, and, coldfusion, since, version, 6, the, document, object, model, of, html, xhtml, and, xml, documents, on, the, internet, has, bindings, to, the, popular, javascript, ecmascript, language, javascript, is, perhaps, the, best, known, prototype, based, programming, language, which, employs, cloning, from, prototypes, rather, than, inheriting, from, a, class, contrast, to, class, based, programming, another, scripting, language, that, takes, this, approach, is, lua, the, messages, that, flow, between, computers, to, request, services, in, a, client, server, environment, can, be, designed, as, the, linearizations, of, objects, defined, by, class, objects, known, to, both, the, client, and, the, server, for, example, a, simple, linearized, object, would, consist, of, a, length, field, a, code, point, identifying, the, class, and, a, data, value, a, more, complex, example, would, be, a, command, consisting, of, the, length, and, code, point, of, the, command, and, values, consisting, of, linearized, objects, representing, the, command, s, parameters, each, such, command, must, be, directed, by, the, server, to, an, object, whose, class, or, superclass, recognizes, the, command, and, can, provide, the, requested, service, clients, and, servers, are, best, modeled, as, complex, object, oriented, structures, distributed, data, management, architecture, ddm, took, this, approach, and, used, class, objects, to, define, objects, at, four, levels, of, a, formal, hierarchy, the, initial, version, of, ddm, defined, distributed, file, services, it, was, later, extended, to, be, the, foundation, of, distributed, relational, database, architecture, drda, one, way, to, address, challenges, of, object, oriented, design, is, via, design, patterns, which, are, solution, patterns, to, commonly, occurring, problems, in, software, design, some, of, these, commonly, occurring, problems, have, implications, and, solutions, particular, to, object, oriented, development, the, following, are, notable, software, design, patterns, for, oop, objects, as, an, example, of, an, object, anti, pattern, the, god, object, knows, or, does, too, much, it, is, intuitive, to, assume, that, inheritance, creates, a, semantic, is, a, relationship, and, thus, to, infer, that, objects, instantiated, from, subclasses, can, always, be, safely, used, instead, of, those, instantiated, from, the, superclass, this, intuition, is, unfortunately, false, in, most, oop, languages, in, particular, in, all, those, that, allow, mutable, objects, subtype, polymorphism, as, enforced, by, the, type, checker, in, oop, languages, with, mutable, objects, cannot, guarantee, behavioral, subtyping, in, any, context, behavioral, subtyping, is, undecidable, in, general, so, it, cannot, be, implemented, by, a, program, compiler, class, or, object, hierarchies, must, be, carefully, designed, considering, possible, incorrect, uses, that, cannot, be, detected, syntactically, this, issue, is, known, as, the, liskov, substitution, principle, design, patterns, elements, of, reusable, object, oriented, software, is, an, influential, book, published, in, 1994, by, erich, gamma, richard, helm, ralph, johnson, and, john, vlissides, often, referred, to, humorously, as, the, gang, of, four, along, with, exploring, the, capabilities, and, pitfalls, of, object, oriented, programming, it, describes, 23, common, programming, problems, and, patterns, for, solving, them, the, book, describes, the, following, patterns, both, object, oriented, programming, and, relational, database, management, systems, rdbmss, are, extremely, common, in, software, today, since, relational, databases, do, not, store, objects, directly, though, some, rdbmss, have, object, oriented, features, to, approximate, this, there, is, a, general, need, to, bridge, the, two, worlds, the, problem, of, bridging, object, oriented, programming, accesses, and, data, patterns, with, relational, databases, is, known, as, object, relational, impedance, mismatch, there, are, some, approaches, to, cope, with, this, problem, but, no, general, solution, without, downsides, one, of, the, most, common, approaches, is, object, relational, mapping, as, found, in, ide, languages, such, as, visual, foxpro, and, libraries, such, as, java, data, objects, and, ruby, on, rails, activerecord, there, are, also, object, databases, that, can, be, used, to, replace, rdbmss, but, these, have, not, been, as, technically, and, commercially, successful, as, rdbmss, oop, can, be, used, to, associate, real, world, objects, and, processes, with, digital, counterparts, however, not, everyone, agrees, that, oop, facilitates, direct, real, world, mapping, or, that, real, world, mapping, is, even, a, worthy, goal, bertrand, meyer, argues, in, object, oriented, software, construction, that, a, program, is, not, a, model, of, the, world, but, a, model, of, some, part, of, the, world, reality, is, a, cousin, twice, removed, at, the, same, time, some, principal, limitations, of, oop, have, been, noted, for, example, the, circle, ellipse, problem, is, difficult, to, handle, using, oop, s, concept, of, inheritance, however, niklaus, wirth, who, popularized, the, adage, now, known, as, wirth, s, law, software, is, getting, slower, more, rapidly, than, hardware, becomes, faster, said, of, oop, in, his, paper, good, ideas, through, the, looking, glass, this, paradigm, closely, reflects, the, structure, of, systems, in, the, real, world, and, is, therefore, well, suited, to, model, complex, systems, with, complex, behavior, contrast, kiss, principle, steve, yegge, and, others, noted, that, natural, languages, lack, the, oop, approach, of, strictly, prioritizing, things, objects, nouns, before, actions, methods, verbs, this, problem, may, cause, oop, to, suffer, more, convoluted, solutions, than, procedural, programming, oop, was, developed, to, increase, the, reusability, and, maintainability, of, source, code, transparent, representation, of, the, control, flow, had, no, priority, and, was, meant, to, be, handled, by, a, compiler, with, the, increasing, relevance, of, parallel, hardware, and, multithreaded, coding, developing, transparent, control, flow, becomes, more, important, something, hard, to, achieve, with, oop, responsibility, driven, design, defines, classes, in, terms, of, a, contract, that, is, a, class, should, be, defined, around, a, responsibility, and, the, information, that, it, shares, this, is, contrasted, by, wirfs, brock, and, wilkerson, with, data, driven, design, where, classes, are, defined, around, the, data, structures, that, must, be, held, the, authors, hold, that, responsibility, driven, design, is, preferable, solid, is, a, mnemonic, invented, by, michael, feathers, which, spells, out, five, software, engineering, design, principles, grasp, general, responsibility, assignment, software, patterns, is, another, set, of, guidelines, advocated, by, craig, larman, objects, are, the, run, time, entities, in, an, object, oriented, system, they, may, represent, a, person, a, place, a, bank, account, a, table, of, data, or, any, item, that, the, program, has, to, handle, there, have, been, several, attempts, at, formalizing, the, concepts, used, in, object, oriented, programming, the, following, concepts, and, constructs, have, been, used, as, interpretations, of, oop, concepts, attempts, to, find, a, consensus, definition, or, theory, behind, objects, have, not, proven, very, successful, however, see, abadi, cardelli, a, theory, of, objects, for, formal, definitions, of, many, oop, concepts, and, constructs, and, often, diverge, widely, for, example, some, definitions, focus, on, mental, activities, and, some, on, program, structuring, one, of, the, simpler, definitions, is, that, oop, is, the, act, of, using, map, data, structures, or, arrays, that, can, contain, functions, and, pointers, to, other, maps, all, with, some, syntactic, and, scoping, sugar, on, top, inheritance, can, be, performed, by, cloning, the, maps, sometimes, called, prototyping
