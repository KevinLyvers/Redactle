c, pronounced, s, i, like, the, letter, c, is, a, general, purpose, programming, language, it, was, created, in, the, 1970s, by, dennis, ritchie, and, remains, very, widely, used, and, influential, by, design, c, s, features, cleanly, reflect, the, capabilities, of, the, targeted, cpus, it, has, found, lasting, use, in, operating, systems, code, especially, in, kernels, device, drivers, and, protocol, stacks, but, its, use, in, application, software, has, been, decreasing, c, is, commonly, used, on, computer, architectures, that, range, from, the, largest, supercomputers, to, the, smallest, microcontrollers, and, embedded, systems, a, successor, to, the, programming, language, b, c, was, originally, developed, at, bell, labs, by, ritchie, between, 1972, and, 1973, to, construct, utilities, running, on, unix, it, was, applied, to, re, implementing, the, kernel, of, the, unix, operating, system, during, the, 1980s, c, gradually, gained, popularity, it, has, become, one, of, the, most, widely, used, programming, languages, with, c, compilers, available, for, practically, all, modern, computer, architectures, and, operating, systems, the, book, the, c, programming, language, co, authored, by, the, original, language, designer, served, for, many, years, as, the, de, facto, standard, for, the, language, c, has, been, standardized, since, 1989, by, the, american, national, standards, institute, ansi, and, subsequently, jointly, by, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, and, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, c, is, an, imperative, procedural, language, supporting, structured, programming, lexical, variable, scope, and, recursion, with, a, static, type, system, it, was, designed, to, be, compiled, to, provide, low, level, access, to, memory, and, language, constructs, that, map, efficiently, to, machine, instructions, all, with, minimal, runtime, support, despite, its, low, level, capabilities, the, language, was, designed, to, encourage, cross, platform, programming, a, standards, compliant, c, program, written, with, portability, in, mind, can, be, compiled, for, a, wide, variety, of, computer, platforms, and, operating, systems, with, few, changes, to, its, source, code, since, 2000, c, has, consistently, ranked, among, the, top, three, languages, in, the, tiobe, index, a, measure, of, the, popularity, of, programming, languages, c, is, an, imperative, procedural, language, in, the, algol, tradition, it, has, a, static, type, system, in, c, all, executable, code, is, contained, within, subroutines, also, called, functions, though, not, in, the, sense, of, functional, programming, function, parameters, are, passed, by, value, although, arrays, are, passed, as, pointers, i, e, the, address, of, the, first, item, in, the, array, pass, by, reference, is, simulated, in, c, by, explicitly, passing, pointers, to, the, thing, being, referenced, c, program, source, text, is, free, form, code, semicolons, terminate, statements, while, curly, braces, are, used, to, group, statements, into, blocks, the, c, language, also, exhibits, the, following, characteristics, while, c, does, not, include, certain, features, found, in, other, languages, such, as, object, orientation, and, garbage, collection, these, can, be, implemented, or, emulated, often, through, the, use, of, external, libraries, e, g, the, glib, object, system, or, the, boehm, garbage, collector, many, later, languages, have, borrowed, directly, or, indirectly, from, c, including, c, c, unix, s, c, shell, d, go, java, javascript, including, transpilers, julia, limbo, lpc, objective, c, perl, php, python, ruby, rust, swift, verilog, and, systemverilog, hardware, description, languages, these, languages, have, drawn, many, of, their, control, structures, and, other, basic, features, from, c, most, of, them, also, express, highly, similar, syntax, to, c, and, they, tend, to, combine, the, recognizable, expression, and, statement, syntax, of, c, with, underlying, type, systems, data, models, and, semantics, that, can, be, radically, different, the, origin, of, c, is, closely, tied, to, the, development, of, the, unix, operating, system, originally, implemented, in, assembly, language, on, a, pdp, 7, by, dennis, ritchie, and, ken, thompson, incorporating, several, ideas, from, colleagues, eventually, they, decided, to, port, the, operating, system, to, a, pdp, 11, the, original, pdp, 11, version, of, unix, was, also, developed, in, assembly, language, thompson, wanted, a, programming, language, for, developing, utilities, for, the, new, platform, at, first, he, tried, to, write, a, fortran, compiler, but, he, soon, gave, up, the, idea, instead, he, created, a, cut, down, version, of, the, recently, developed, systems, programming, language, called, bcpl, the, official, description, of, bcpl, was, not, available, at, the, time, and, thompson, modified, the, syntax, to, be, less, wordy, and, similar, to, a, simplified, algol, known, as, smalgol, thompson, called, the, result, b, he, described, b, as, bcpl, semantics, with, a, lot, of, smalgol, syntax, like, bcpl, b, had, a, bootstrapping, compiler, to, facilitate, porting, to, new, machines, however, few, utilities, were, ultimately, written, in, b, because, it, was, too, slow, and, could, not, take, advantage, of, pdp, 11, features, such, as, byte, addressability, in, 1971, ritchie, started, to, improve, b, to, use, the, features, of, the, more, powerful, pdp, 11, a, significant, addition, was, a, character, data, type, he, called, this, new, b, nb, thompson, started, to, use, nb, to, write, the, unix, kernel, and, his, requirements, shaped, the, direction, of, the, language, development, through, to, 1972, richer, types, were, added, to, the, nb, language, nb, had, arrays, of, int, and, char, pointers, the, ability, to, generate, pointers, to, other, types, arrays, of, all, types, and, types, to, be, returned, from, functions, were, all, also, added, arrays, within, expressions, became, pointers, a, new, compiler, was, written, and, the, language, was, renamed, c, the, c, compiler, and, some, utilities, made, with, it, were, included, in, version, 2, unix, which, is, also, known, as, research, unix, at, version, 4, unix, released, in, november, 1973, the, unix, kernel, was, extensively, re, implemented, in, c, by, this, time, the, c, language, had, acquired, some, powerful, features, such, as, struct, types, the, preprocessor, was, introduced, around, 1973, at, the, urging, of, alan, snyder, and, also, in, recognition, of, the, usefulness, of, the, file, inclusion, mechanisms, available, in, bcpl, and, pl, i, its, original, version, provided, only, included, files, and, simple, string, replacements, include, and, define, of, parameterless, macros, soon, after, that, it, was, extended, mostly, by, mike, lesk, and, then, by, john, reiser, to, incorporate, macros, with, arguments, and, conditional, compilation, unix, was, one, of, the, first, operating, system, kernels, implemented, in, a, language, other, than, assembly, earlier, instances, include, the, multics, system, which, was, written, in, pl, i, and, master, control, program, mcp, for, the, burroughs, b5000, which, was, written, in, algol, in, 1961, in, around, 1977, ritchie, and, stephen, c, johnson, made, further, changes, to, the, language, to, facilitate, portability, of, the, unix, operating, system, johnson, s, portable, c, compiler, served, as, the, basis, for, several, implementations, of, c, on, new, platforms, in, 1978, brian, kernighan, and, dennis, ritchie, published, the, first, edition, of, the, c, programming, language, known, as, k, r, from, the, initials, of, its, authors, the, book, served, for, many, years, as, an, informal, specification, of, the, language, the, version, of, c, that, it, describes, is, commonly, referred, to, as, k, r, c, as, this, was, released, in, 1978, it, is, now, also, referred, to, as, c78, the, second, edition, of, the, book, covers, the, later, ansi, c, standard, described, below, k, r, introduced, several, language, features, even, after, the, publication, of, the, 1989, ansi, standard, for, many, years, k, r, c, was, still, considered, the, lowest, common, denominator, to, which, c, programmers, restricted, themselves, when, maximum, portability, was, desired, since, many, older, compilers, were, still, in, use, and, because, carefully, written, k, r, c, code, can, be, legal, standard, c, as, well, in, early, versions, of, c, only, functions, that, return, types, other, than, int, must, be, declared, if, used, before, the, function, definition, functions, used, without, prior, declaration, were, presumed, to, return, type, int, for, example, the, int, type, specifiers, which, are, commented, out, could, be, omitted, in, k, r, c, but, are, required, in, later, standards, since, k, r, function, declarations, did, not, include, any, information, about, function, arguments, function, parameter, type, checks, were, not, performed, although, some, compilers, would, issue, a, warning, message, if, a, local, function, was, called, with, the, wrong, number, of, arguments, or, if, different, calls, to, an, external, function, used, different, numbers, or, types, of, arguments, separate, tools, such, as, unix, s, lint, utility, were, developed, that, among, other, things, could, check, for, consistency, of, function, use, across, multiple, source, files, in, the, years, following, the, publication, of, k, r, c, several, features, were, added, to, the, language, supported, by, compilers, from, at, t, in, particular, pcc, and, some, other, vendors, these, included, the, large, number, of, extensions, and, lack, of, agreement, on, a, standard, library, together, with, the, language, popularity, and, the, fact, that, not, even, the, unix, compilers, precisely, implemented, the, k, r, specification, led, to, the, necessity, of, standardization, during, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, versions, of, c, were, implemented, for, a, wide, variety, of, mainframe, computers, minicomputers, and, microcomputers, including, the, ibm, pc, as, its, popularity, began, to, increase, significantly, in, 1983, the, american, national, standards, institute, ansi, formed, a, committee, x3j11, to, establish, a, standard, specification, of, c, x3j11, based, the, c, standard, on, the, unix, implementation, however, the, non, portable, portion, of, the, unix, c, library, was, handed, off, to, the, ieee, working, group, 1003, to, become, the, basis, for, the, 1988, posix, standard, in, 1989, the, c, standard, was, ratified, as, ansi, x3, 159, 1989, programming, language, c, this, version, of, the, language, is, often, referred, to, as, ansi, c, standard, c, or, sometimes, c89, in, 1990, the, ansi, c, standard, with, formatting, changes, was, adopted, by, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, as, iso, iec, 9899, 1990, which, is, sometimes, called, c90, therefore, the, terms, c89, and, c90, refer, to, the, same, programming, language, ansi, like, other, national, standards, bodies, no, longer, develops, the, c, standard, independently, but, defers, to, the, international, c, standard, maintained, by, the, working, group, iso, iec, jtc1, sc22, wg14, national, adoption, of, an, update, to, the, international, standard, typically, occurs, within, a, year, of, iso, publication, one, of, the, aims, of, the, c, standardization, process, was, to, produce, a, superset, of, k, r, c, incorporating, many, of, the, subsequently, introduced, unofficial, features, the, standards, committee, also, included, several, additional, features, such, as, function, prototypes, borrowed, from, c, void, pointers, support, for, international, character, sets, and, locales, and, preprocessor, enhancements, although, the, syntax, for, parameter, declarations, was, augmented, to, include, the, style, used, in, c, the, k, r, interface, continued, to, be, permitted, for, compatibility, with, existing, source, code, c89, is, supported, by, current, c, compilers, and, most, modern, c, code, is, based, on, it, any, program, written, only, in, standard, c, and, without, any, hardware, dependent, assumptions, will, run, correctly, on, any, platform, with, a, conforming, c, implementation, within, its, resource, limits, without, such, precautions, programs, may, compile, only, on, a, certain, platform, or, with, a, particular, compiler, due, for, example, to, the, use, of, non, standard, libraries, such, as, gui, libraries, or, to, a, reliance, on, compiler, or, platform, specific, attributes, such, as, the, exact, size, of, data, types, and, byte, endianness, in, cases, where, code, must, be, compilable, by, either, standard, conforming, or, k, r, c, based, compilers, the, stdc, macro, can, be, used, to, split, the, code, into, standard, and, k, r, sections, to, prevent, the, use, on, a, k, r, c, based, compiler, of, features, available, only, in, standard, c, after, the, ansi, iso, standardization, process, the, c, language, specification, remained, relatively, static, for, several, years, in, 1995, normative, amendment, 1, to, the, 1990, c, standard, iso, iec, 9899, amd1, 1995, known, informally, as, c95, was, published, to, correct, some, details, and, to, add, more, extensive, support, for, international, character, sets, the, c, standard, was, further, revised, in, the, late, 1990s, leading, to, the, publication, of, iso, iec, 9899, 1999, in, 1999, which, is, commonly, referred, to, as, c99, it, has, since, been, amended, three, times, by, technical, corrigenda, c99, introduced, several, new, features, including, inline, functions, several, new, data, types, including, long, long, int, and, a, complex, type, to, represent, complex, numbers, variable, length, arrays, and, flexible, array, members, improved, support, for, ieee, 754, floating, point, support, for, variadic, macros, macros, of, variable, arity, and, support, for, one, line, comments, beginning, with, as, in, bcpl, or, c, many, of, these, had, already, been, implemented, as, extensions, in, several, c, compilers, c99, is, for, the, most, part, backward, compatible, with, c90, but, is, stricter, in, some, ways, in, particular, a, declaration, that, lacks, a, type, specifier, no, longer, has, int, implicitly, assumed, a, standard, macro, stdc, version, is, defined, with, value, 199901l, to, indicate, that, c99, support, is, available, gcc, solaris, studio, and, other, c, compilers, now, support, many, or, all, of, the, new, features, of, c99, the, c, compiler, in, microsoft, visual, c, however, implements, the, c89, standard, and, those, parts, of, c99, that, are, required, for, compatibility, with, c, 11, in, addition, the, c99, standard, requires, support, for, identifiers, using, unicode, in, the, form, of, escaped, characters, e, g, u0040, or, u0001f431, and, suggests, support, for, raw, unicode, names, in, 2007, work, began, on, another, revision, of, the, c, standard, informally, called, c1x, until, its, official, publication, of, iso, iec, 9899, 2011, on, 2011, 12, 08, the, c, standards, committee, adopted, guidelines, to, limit, the, adoption, of, new, features, that, had, not, been, tested, by, existing, implementations, the, c11, standard, adds, numerous, new, features, to, c, and, the, library, including, type, generic, macros, anonymous, structures, improved, unicode, support, atomic, operations, multi, threading, and, bounds, checked, functions, it, also, makes, some, portions, of, the, existing, c99, library, optional, and, improves, compatibility, with, c, the, standard, macro, stdc, version, is, defined, as, 201112l, to, indicate, that, c11, support, is, available, published, in, june, 2018, as, iso, iec, 9899, 2018, c17, is, the, current, standard, for, the, c, programming, language, it, introduces, no, new, language, features, only, technical, corrections, and, clarifications, to, defects, in, c11, the, standard, macro, stdc, version, is, defined, as, 201710l, to, indicate, that, c17, support, is, available, c23, is, the, informal, name, for, the, next, after, c17, major, c, language, standard, revision, it, was, informally, known, as, c2x, through, most, of, its, development, c23, is, expected, to, be, published, in, early, 2024, as, iso, iec, 9899, 2024, the, standard, macro, stdc, version, is, defined, as, 202311l, to, indicate, that, c23, support, is, available, c2y, is, a, temporary, informal, name, for, the, next, major, c, language, standard, revision, after, c23, c2x, that, is, hoped, to, be, released, later, in, the, 2020s, decade, hence, the, 2, in, c2y, an, early, working, draft, of, c2y, was, released, in, february, 2024, as, n3220, by, the, working, group, iso, iec, jtc1, sc22, wg14, historically, embedded, c, programming, requires, nonstandard, extensions, to, the, c, language, to, support, exotic, features, such, as, fixed, point, arithmetic, multiple, distinct, memory, banks, and, basic, i, o, operations, in, 2008, the, c, standards, committee, published, a, technical, report, extending, the, c, language, to, address, these, issues, by, providing, a, common, standard, for, all, implementations, to, adhere, to, it, includes, a, number, of, features, not, available, in, normal, c, such, as, fixed, point, arithmetic, named, address, spaces, and, basic, i, o, hardware, addressing, c, has, a, formal, grammar, specified, by, the, c, standard, line, endings, are, generally, not, significant, in, c, however, line, boundaries, do, have, significance, during, the, preprocessing, phase, comments, may, appear, either, between, the, delimiters, and, or, since, c99, following, until, the, end, of, the, line, comments, delimited, by, and, do, not, nest, and, these, sequences, of, characters, are, not, interpreted, as, comment, delimiters, if, they, appear, inside, string, or, character, literals, c, source, files, contain, declarations, and, function, definitions, function, definitions, in, turn, contain, declarations, and, statements, declarations, either, define, new, types, using, keywords, such, as, struct, union, and, enum, or, assign, types, to, and, perhaps, reserve, storage, for, new, variables, usually, by, writing, the, type, followed, by, the, variable, name, keywords, such, as, char, and, int, specify, built, in, types, sections, of, code, are, enclosed, in, braces, and, sometimes, called, curly, brackets, to, limit, the, scope, of, declarations, and, to, act, as, a, single, statement, for, control, structures, as, an, imperative, language, c, uses, statements, to, specify, actions, the, most, common, statement, is, an, expression, statement, consisting, of, an, expression, to, be, evaluated, followed, by, a, semicolon, as, a, side, effect, of, the, evaluation, functions, may, be, called, and, variables, may, be, assigned, new, values, to, modify, the, normal, sequential, execution, of, statements, c, provides, several, control, flow, statements, identified, by, reserved, keywords, structured, programming, is, supported, by, if, conditional, execution, and, by, do, while, while, and, for, iterative, execution, looping, the, for, statement, has, separate, initialization, testing, and, reinitialization, expressions, any, or, all, of, which, can, be, omitted, break, and, continue, can, be, used, within, the, loop, break, is, used, to, leave, the, innermost, enclosing, loop, statement, and, continue, is, used, to, skip, to, its, reinitialisation, there, is, also, a, non, structured, goto, statement, which, branches, directly, to, the, designated, label, within, the, function, switch, selects, a, case, to, be, executed, based, on, the, value, of, an, integer, expression, different, from, many, other, languages, control, flow, will, fall, through, to, the, next, case, unless, terminated, by, a, break, expressions, can, use, a, variety, of, built, in, operators, and, may, contain, function, calls, the, order, in, which, arguments, to, functions, and, operands, to, most, operators, are, evaluated, is, unspecified, the, evaluations, may, even, be, interleaved, however, all, side, effects, including, storage, to, variables, will, occur, before, the, next, sequence, point, sequence, points, include, the, end, of, each, expression, statement, and, the, entry, to, and, return, from, each, function, call, sequence, points, also, occur, during, evaluation, of, expressions, containing, certain, operators, and, the, comma, operator, this, permits, a, high, degree, of, object, code, optimization, by, the, compiler, but, requires, c, programmers, to, take, more, care, to, obtain, reliable, results, than, is, needed, for, other, programming, languages, kernighan, and, ritchie, say, in, the, introduction, of, the, c, programming, language, c, like, any, other, language, has, its, blemishes, some, of, the, operators, have, the, wrong, precedence, some, parts, of, the, syntax, could, be, better, the, c, standard, did, not, attempt, to, correct, many, of, these, blemishes, because, of, the, impact, of, such, changes, on, already, existing, software, the, basic, c, source, character, set, includes, the, following, characters, newline, indicates, the, end, of, a, text, line, it, need, not, correspond, to, an, actual, single, character, although, for, convenience, c, treats, it, as, one, additional, multi, byte, encoded, characters, may, be, used, in, string, literals, but, they, are, not, entirely, portable, the, latest, c, standard, c11, allows, multi, national, unicode, characters, to, be, embedded, portably, within, c, source, text, by, using, uxxxx, or, uxxxxxxxx, encoding, where, the, x, denotes, a, hexadecimal, character, although, this, feature, is, not, yet, widely, implemented, the, basic, c, execution, character, set, contains, the, same, characters, along, with, representations, for, alert, backspace, and, carriage, return, run, time, support, for, extended, character, sets, has, increased, with, each, revision, of, the, c, standard, the, following, reserved, words, are, case, sensitive, c89, has, 32, reserved, words, also, known, as, keywords, which, are, the, words, that, cannot, be, used, for, any, purposes, other, than, those, for, which, they, are, predefined, c99, reserved, five, more, words, is, an, alternative, spelling, alias, for, a, c23, keyword, c11, reserved, seven, more, words, is, an, alternative, spelling, alias, for, a, c23, keyword, c23, reserved, fifteen, more, words, most, of, the, recently, reserved, words, begin, with, an, underscore, followed, by, a, capital, letter, because, identifiers, of, that, form, were, previously, reserved, by, the, c, standard, for, use, only, by, implementations, since, existing, program, source, code, should, not, have, been, using, these, identifiers, it, would, not, be, affected, when, c, implementations, started, supporting, these, extensions, to, the, programming, language, some, standard, headers, do, define, more, convenient, synonyms, for, underscored, identifiers, some, of, those, words, were, added, as, keywords, with, their, conventional, spelling, in, c23, and, the, corresponding, macros, were, removed, prior, to, c89, entry, was, reserved, as, a, keyword, in, the, second, edition, of, their, book, the, c, programming, language, which, describes, what, became, known, as, c89, kernighan, and, ritchie, wrote, the, entry, formerly, reserved, but, never, used, is, no, longer, reserved, and, the, stillborn, entry, keyword, is, withdrawn, c, supports, a, rich, set, of, operators, which, are, symbols, used, within, an, expression, to, specify, the, manipulations, to, be, performed, while, evaluating, that, expression, c, has, operators, for, c, uses, the, operator, used, in, mathematics, to, express, equality, to, indicate, assignment, following, the, precedent, of, fortran, and, pl, i, but, unlike, algol, and, its, derivatives, c, uses, the, operator, to, test, for, equality, the, similarity, between, these, two, operators, assignment, and, equality, may, result, in, the, accidental, use, of, one, in, place, of, the, other, and, in, many, cases, the, mistake, does, not, produce, an, error, message, although, some, compilers, produce, warnings, for, example, the, conditional, expression, if, a, b, 1, might, mistakenly, be, written, as, if, a, b, 1, which, will, be, evaluated, as, true, unless, the, value, of, a, is, 0, after, the, assignment, the, c, operator, precedence, is, not, always, intuitive, for, example, the, operator, binds, more, tightly, than, is, executed, prior, to, the, operators, bitwise, and, and, bitwise, or, in, expressions, such, as, x, 1, 0, which, must, be, written, as, x, and, 1, 0, if, that, is, the, coder, s, intent, the, hello, world, example, which, appeared, in, the, first, edition, of, k, r, has, become, the, model, for, an, introductory, program, in, most, programming, textbooks, the, program, prints, hello, world, to, the, standard, output, which, is, usually, a, terminal, or, screen, display, the, original, version, was, a, standard, conforming, hello, world, program, is, the, first, line, of, the, program, contains, a, preprocessing, directive, indicated, by, include, this, causes, the, compiler, to, replace, that, line, with, the, entire, text, of, the, stdio, h, standard, header, which, contains, declarations, for, standard, input, and, output, functions, such, as, printf, and, scanf, the, angle, brackets, surrounding, stdio, h, indicate, that, stdio, h, can, be, located, using, a, search, strategy, that, prefers, headers, provided, with, the, compiler, to, other, headers, having, the, same, name, as, opposed, to, double, quotes, which, typically, include, local, or, project, specific, header, files, the, next, line, indicates, that, a, function, named, main, is, being, defined, the, main, function, serves, a, special, purpose, in, c, programs, the, run, time, environment, calls, the, main, function, to, begin, program, execution, the, type, specifier, int, indicates, that, the, value, that, is, returned, to, the, invoker, in, this, case, the, run, time, environment, as, a, result, of, evaluating, the, main, function, is, an, integer, the, keyword, void, as, a, parameter, list, indicates, that, this, function, takes, no, arguments, the, opening, curly, brace, indicates, the, beginning, of, the, definition, of, the, main, function, the, next, line, calls, diverts, execution, to, a, function, named, printf, which, in, this, case, is, supplied, from, a, system, library, in, this, call, the, printf, function, is, passed, provided, with, a, single, argument, the, address, of, the, first, character, in, the, string, literal, hello, world, n, the, string, literal, is, an, unnamed, array, with, elements, of, type, char, set, up, automatically, by, the, compiler, with, a, final, null, ascii, value, 0, character, to, mark, the, end, of, the, array, for, printf, to, know, the, length, of, the, string, the, null, character, can, be, also, written, as, an, escape, sequence, written, as, 0, the, n, is, an, escape, sequence, that, c, translates, to, a, newline, character, which, on, output, signifies, the, end, of, the, current, line, the, return, value, of, the, printf, function, is, of, type, int, but, it, is, silently, discarded, since, it, is, not, used, a, more, careful, program, might, test, the, return, value, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, printf, function, succeeded, the, semicolon, terminates, the, statement, the, closing, curly, brace, indicates, the, end, of, the, code, for, the, main, function, according, to, the, c99, specification, and, newer, the, main, function, unlike, any, other, function, will, implicitly, return, a, value, of, 0, upon, reaching, the, that, terminates, the, function, formerly, an, explicit, return, 0, statement, was, required, this, is, interpreted, by, the, run, time, system, as, an, exit, code, indicating, successful, execution, the, type, system, in, c, is, static, and, weakly, typed, which, makes, it, similar, to, the, type, system, of, algol, descendants, such, as, pascal, there, are, built, in, types, for, integers, of, various, sizes, both, signed, and, unsigned, floating, point, numbers, and, enumerated, types, enum, integer, type, char, is, often, used, for, single, byte, characters, c99, added, a, boolean, data, type, there, are, also, derived, types, including, arrays, pointers, records, struct, and, unions, union, c, is, often, used, in, low, level, systems, programming, where, escapes, from, the, type, system, may, be, necessary, the, compiler, attempts, to, ensure, type, correctness, of, most, expressions, but, the, programmer, can, override, the, checks, in, various, ways, either, by, using, a, type, cast, to, explicitly, convert, a, value, from, one, type, to, another, or, by, using, pointers, or, unions, to, reinterpret, the, underlying, bits, of, a, data, object, in, some, other, way, some, find, c, s, declaration, syntax, unintuitive, particularly, for, function, pointers, ritchie, s, idea, was, to, declare, identifiers, in, contexts, resembling, their, use, declaration, reflects, use, c, s, usual, arithmetic, conversions, allow, for, efficient, code, to, be, generated, but, can, sometimes, produce, unexpected, results, for, example, a, comparison, of, signed, and, unsigned, integers, of, equal, width, requires, a, conversion, of, the, signed, value, to, unsigned, this, can, generate, unexpected, results, if, the, signed, value, is, negative, c, supports, the, use, of, pointers, a, type, of, reference, that, records, the, address, or, location, of, an, object, or, function, in, memory, pointers, can, be, dereferenced, to, access, data, stored, at, the, address, pointed, to, or, to, invoke, a, pointed, to, function, pointers, can, be, manipulated, using, assignment, or, pointer, arithmetic, the, run, time, representation, of, a, pointer, value, is, typically, a, raw, memory, address, perhaps, augmented, by, an, offset, within, word, field, but, since, a, pointer, s, type, includes, the, type, of, the, thing, pointed, to, expressions, including, pointers, can, be, type, checked, at, compile, time, pointer, arithmetic, is, automatically, scaled, by, the, size, of, the, pointed, to, data, type, pointers, are, used, for, many, purposes, in, c, text, strings, are, commonly, manipulated, using, pointers, into, arrays, of, characters, dynamic, memory, allocation, is, performed, using, pointers, the, result, of, a, malloc, is, usually, cast, to, the, data, type, of, the, data, to, be, stored, many, data, types, such, as, trees, are, commonly, implemented, as, dynamically, allocated, struct, objects, linked, together, using, pointers, pointers, to, other, pointers, are, often, used, in, multi, dimensional, arrays, and, arrays, of, struct, objects, pointers, to, functions, function, pointers, are, useful, for, passing, functions, as, arguments, to, higher, order, functions, such, as, qsort, or, bsearch, in, dispatch, tables, or, as, callbacks, to, event, handlers, a, null, pointer, value, explicitly, points, to, no, valid, location, dereferencing, a, null, pointer, value, is, undefined, often, resulting, in, a, segmentation, fault, null, pointer, values, are, useful, for, indicating, special, cases, such, as, no, next, pointer, in, the, final, node, of, a, linked, list, or, as, an, error, indication, from, functions, returning, pointers, in, appropriate, contexts, in, source, code, such, as, for, assigning, to, a, pointer, variable, a, null, pointer, constant, can, be, written, as, 0, with, or, without, explicit, casting, to, a, pointer, type, as, the, null, macro, defined, by, several, standard, headers, or, since, c23, with, the, constant, nullptr, in, conditional, contexts, null, pointer, values, evaluate, to, false, while, all, other, pointer, values, evaluate, to, true, void, pointers, void, point, to, objects, of, unspecified, type, and, can, therefore, be, used, as, generic, data, pointers, since, the, size, and, type, of, the, pointed, to, object, is, not, known, void, pointers, cannot, be, dereferenced, nor, is, pointer, arithmetic, on, them, allowed, although, they, can, easily, be, and, in, many, contexts, implicitly, are, converted, to, and, from, any, other, object, pointer, type, careless, use, of, pointers, is, potentially, dangerous, because, they, are, typically, unchecked, a, pointer, variable, can, be, made, to, point, to, any, arbitrary, location, which, can, cause, undesirable, effects, although, properly, used, pointers, point, to, safe, places, they, can, be, made, to, point, to, unsafe, places, by, using, invalid, pointer, arithmetic, the, objects, they, point, to, may, continue, to, be, used, after, deallocation, dangling, pointers, they, may, be, used, without, having, been, initialized, wild, pointers, or, they, may, be, directly, assigned, an, unsafe, value, using, a, cast, union, or, through, another, corrupt, pointer, in, general, c, is, permissive, in, allowing, manipulation, of, and, conversion, between, pointer, types, although, compilers, typically, provide, options, for, various, levels, of, checking, some, other, programming, languages, address, these, problems, by, using, more, restrictive, reference, types, array, types, in, c, are, traditionally, of, a, fixed, static, size, specified, at, compile, time, the, more, recent, c99, standard, also, allows, a, form, of, variable, length, arrays, however, it, is, also, possible, to, allocate, a, block, of, memory, of, arbitrary, size, at, run, time, using, the, standard, library, s, malloc, function, and, treat, it, as, an, array, since, arrays, are, always, accessed, in, effect, via, pointers, array, accesses, are, typically, not, checked, against, the, underlying, array, size, although, some, compilers, may, provide, bounds, checking, as, an, option, array, bounds, violations, are, therefore, possible, and, can, lead, to, various, repercussions, including, illegal, memory, accesses, corruption, of, data, buffer, overruns, and, run, time, exceptions, c, does, not, have, a, special, provision, for, declaring, multi, dimensional, arrays, but, rather, relies, on, recursion, within, the, type, system, to, declare, arrays, of, arrays, which, effectively, accomplishes, the, same, thing, the, index, values, of, the, resulting, multi, dimensional, array, can, be, thought, of, as, increasing, in, row, major, order, multi, dimensional, arrays, are, commonly, used, in, numerical, algorithms, mainly, from, applied, linear, algebra, to, store, matrices, the, structure, of, the, c, array, is, well, suited, to, this, particular, task, however, in, early, versions, of, c, the, bounds, of, the, array, must, be, known, fixed, values, or, else, explicitly, passed, to, any, subroutine, that, requires, them, and, dynamically, sized, arrays, of, arrays, cannot, be, accessed, using, double, indexing, a, workaround, for, this, was, to, allocate, the, array, with, an, additional, row, vector, of, pointers, to, the, columns, c99, introduced, variable, length, arrays, which, address, this, issue, the, following, example, using, modern, c, c99, or, later, shows, allocation, of, a, two, dimensional, array, on, the, heap, and, the, use, of, multi, dimensional, array, indexing, for, accesses, which, can, use, bounds, checking, on, many, c, compilers, and, here, is, a, similar, implementation, using, c99, s, auto, vla, feature, the, subscript, notation, x, where, x, designates, a, pointer, is, syntactic, sugar, for, x, i, taking, advantage, of, the, compiler, s, knowledge, of, the, pointer, type, the, address, that, x, i, points, to, is, not, the, base, address, pointed, to, by, x, incremented, by, i, bytes, but, rather, is, defined, to, be, the, base, address, incremented, by, i, multiplied, by, the, size, of, an, element, that, x, points, to, thus, x, designates, the, i, 1, th, element, of, the, array, furthermore, in, most, expression, contexts, a, notable, exception, is, as, operand, of, sizeof, an, expression, of, array, type, is, automatically, converted, to, a, pointer, to, the, array, s, first, element, this, implies, that, an, array, is, never, copied, as, a, whole, when, named, as, an, argument, to, a, function, but, rather, only, the, address, of, its, first, element, is, passed, therefore, although, function, calls, in, c, use, pass, by, value, semantics, arrays, are, in, effect, passed, by, reference, the, total, size, of, an, array, x, can, be, determined, by, applying, sizeof, to, an, expression, of, array, type, the, size, of, an, element, can, be, determined, by, applying, the, operator, sizeof, to, any, dereferenced, element, of, an, array, a, as, in, n, sizeof, a, thus, the, number, of, elements, in, a, declared, array, a, can, be, determined, as, sizeof, a, sizeof, a, note, that, if, only, a, pointer, to, the, first, element, is, available, as, it, is, often, the, case, in, c, code, because, of, the, automatic, conversion, described, above, the, information, about, the, full, type, of, the, array, and, its, length, are, lost, one, of, the, most, important, functions, of, a, programming, language, is, to, provide, facilities, for, managing, memory, and, the, objects, that, are, stored, in, memory, c, provides, three, principal, ways, to, allocate, memory, for, objects, these, three, approaches, are, appropriate, in, different, situations, and, have, various, trade, offs, for, example, static, memory, allocation, has, little, allocation, overhead, automatic, allocation, may, involve, slightly, more, overhead, and, dynamic, memory, allocation, can, potentially, have, a, great, deal, of, overhead, for, both, allocation, and, deallocation, the, persistent, nature, of, static, objects, is, useful, for, maintaining, state, information, across, function, calls, automatic, allocation, is, easy, to, use, but, stack, space, is, typically, much, more, limited, and, transient, than, either, static, memory, or, heap, space, and, dynamic, memory, allocation, allows, convenient, allocation, of, objects, whose, size, is, known, only, at, run, time, most, c, programs, make, extensive, use, of, all, three, where, possible, automatic, or, static, allocation, is, usually, simplest, because, the, storage, is, managed, by, the, compiler, freeing, the, programmer, of, the, potentially, error, prone, chore, of, manually, allocating, and, releasing, storage, however, many, data, structures, can, change, in, size, at, runtime, and, since, static, allocations, and, automatic, allocations, before, c99, must, have, a, fixed, size, at, compile, time, there, are, many, situations, in, which, dynamic, allocation, is, necessary, prior, to, the, c99, standard, variable, sized, arrays, were, a, common, example, of, this, see, the, article, on, malloc, for, an, example, of, dynamically, allocated, arrays, unlike, automatic, allocation, which, can, fail, at, run, time, with, uncontrolled, consequences, the, dynamic, allocation, functions, return, an, indication, in, the, form, of, a, null, pointer, value, when, the, required, storage, cannot, be, allocated, static, allocation, that, is, too, large, is, usually, detected, by, the, linker, or, loader, before, the, program, can, even, begin, execution, unless, otherwise, specified, static, objects, contain, zero, or, null, pointer, values, upon, program, startup, automatically, and, dynamically, allocated, objects, are, initialized, only, if, an, initial, value, is, explicitly, specified, otherwise, they, initially, have, indeterminate, values, typically, whatever, bit, pattern, happens, to, be, present, in, the, storage, which, might, not, even, represent, a, valid, value, for, that, type, if, the, program, attempts, to, access, an, uninitialized, value, the, results, are, undefined, many, modern, compilers, try, to, detect, and, warn, about, this, problem, but, both, false, positives, and, false, negatives, can, occur, heap, memory, allocation, has, to, be, synchronized, with, its, actual, usage, in, any, program, to, be, reused, as, much, as, possible, for, example, if, the, only, pointer, to, a, heap, memory, allocation, goes, out, of, scope, or, has, its, value, overwritten, before, it, is, deallocated, explicitly, then, that, memory, cannot, be, recovered, for, later, reuse, and, is, essentially, lost, to, the, program, a, phenomenon, known, as, a, memory, leak, conversely, it, is, possible, for, memory, to, be, freed, but, is, referenced, subsequently, leading, to, unpredictable, results, typically, the, failure, symptoms, appear, in, a, portion, of, the, program, unrelated, to, the, code, that, causes, the, error, making, it, difficult, to, diagnose, the, failure, such, issues, are, ameliorated, in, languages, with, automatic, garbage, collection, the, c, programming, language, uses, libraries, as, its, primary, method, of, extension, in, c, a, library, is, a, set, of, functions, contained, within, a, single, archive, file, each, library, typically, has, a, header, file, which, contains, the, prototypes, of, the, functions, contained, within, the, library, that, may, be, used, by, a, program, and, declarations, of, special, data, types, and, macro, symbols, used, with, these, functions, for, a, program, to, use, a, library, it, must, include, the, library, s, header, file, and, the, library, must, be, linked, with, the, program, which, in, many, cases, requires, compiler, flags, e, g, lm, shorthand, for, link, the, math, library, the, most, common, c, library, is, the, c, standard, library, which, is, specified, by, the, iso, and, ansi, c, standards, and, comes, with, every, c, implementation, implementations, which, target, limited, environments, such, as, embedded, systems, may, provide, only, a, subset, of, the, standard, library, this, library, supports, stream, input, and, output, memory, allocation, mathematics, character, strings, and, time, values, several, separate, standard, headers, for, example, stdio, h, specify, the, interfaces, for, these, and, other, standard, library, facilities, another, common, set, of, c, library, functions, are, those, used, by, applications, specifically, targeted, for, unix, and, unix, like, systems, especially, functions, which, provide, an, interface, to, the, kernel, these, functions, are, detailed, in, various, standards, such, as, posix, and, the, single, unix, specification, since, many, programs, have, been, written, in, c, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, other, libraries, available, libraries, are, often, written, in, c, because, c, compilers, generate, efficient, object, code, programmers, then, create, interfaces, to, the, library, so, that, the, routines, can, be, used, from, higher, level, languages, like, java, perl, and, python, file, input, and, output, i, o, is, not, part, of, the, c, language, itself, but, instead, is, handled, by, libraries, such, as, the, c, standard, library, and, their, associated, header, files, e, g, stdio, h, file, handling, is, generally, implemented, through, high, level, i, o, which, works, through, streams, a, stream, is, from, this, perspective, a, data, flow, that, is, independent, of, devices, while, a, file, is, a, concrete, device, the, high, level, i, o, is, done, through, the, association, of, a, stream, to, a, file, in, the, c, standard, library, a, buffer, a, memory, area, or, queue, is, temporarily, used, to, store, data, before, it, is, sent, to, the, final, destination, this, reduces, the, time, spent, waiting, for, slower, devices, for, example, a, hard, drive, or, solid, state, drive, low, level, i, o, functions, are, not, part, of, the, standard, c, library, but, are, generally, part, of, bare, metal, programming, programming, that, is, independent, of, any, operating, system, such, as, most, embedded, programming, with, few, exceptions, implementations, include, low, level, i, o, a, number, of, tools, have, been, developed, to, help, c, programmers, find, and, fix, statements, with, undefined, behavior, or, possibly, erroneous, expressions, with, greater, rigor, than, that, provided, by, the, compiler, the, tool, lint, was, the, first, such, leading, to, many, others, automated, source, code, checking, and, auditing, are, beneficial, in, any, language, and, for, c, many, such, tools, exist, such, as, lint, a, common, practice, is, to, use, lint, to, detect, questionable, code, when, a, program, is, first, written, once, a, program, passes, lint, it, is, then, compiled, using, the, c, compiler, also, many, compilers, can, optionally, warn, about, syntactically, valid, constructs, that, are, likely, to, actually, be, errors, misra, c, is, a, proprietary, set, of, guidelines, to, avoid, such, questionable, code, developed, for, embedded, systems, there, are, also, compilers, libraries, and, operating, system, level, mechanisms, for, performing, actions, that, are, not, a, standard, part, of, c, such, as, bounds, checking, for, arrays, detection, of, buffer, overflow, serialization, dynamic, memory, tracking, and, automatic, garbage, collection, tools, such, as, purify, or, valgrind, and, linking, with, libraries, containing, special, versions, of, the, memory, allocation, functions, can, help, uncover, runtime, errors, in, memory, usage, c, is, widely, used, for, systems, programming, in, implementing, operating, systems, and, embedded, system, applications, this, is, for, several, reasons, c, enables, programmers, to, create, efficient, implementations, of, algorithms, and, data, structures, because, the, layer, of, abstraction, from, hardware, is, thin, and, its, overhead, is, low, an, important, criterion, for, computationally, intensive, programs, for, example, the, gnu, multiple, precision, arithmetic, library, the, gnu, scientific, library, mathematica, and, matlab, are, completely, or, partially, written, in, c, many, languages, support, calling, library, functions, in, c, for, example, the, python, based, framework, numpy, uses, c, for, the, high, performance, and, hardware, interacting, aspects, c, is, sometimes, used, as, an, intermediate, language, by, implementations, of, other, languages, this, approach, may, be, used, for, portability, or, convenience, by, using, c, as, an, intermediate, language, additional, machine, specific, code, generators, are, not, necessary, c, has, some, features, such, as, line, number, preprocessor, directives, and, optional, superfluous, commas, at, the, end, of, initializer, lists, that, support, compilation, of, generated, code, however, some, of, c, s, shortcomings, have, prompted, the, development, of, other, c, based, languages, specifically, designed, for, use, as, intermediate, languages, such, as, c, also, contemporary, major, compilers, gcc, and, llvm, both, feature, an, intermediate, representation, that, is, not, c, and, those, compilers, support, front, ends, for, many, languages, including, c, a, consequence, of, c, s, wide, availability, and, efficiency, is, that, compilers, libraries, and, interpreters, of, other, programming, languages, are, often, implemented, in, c, for, example, the, reference, implementations, of, python, perl, ruby, and, php, are, written, in, c, historically, c, was, sometimes, used, for, web, development, using, the, common, gateway, interface, cgi, as, a, gateway, for, information, between, the, web, application, the, server, and, the, browser, c, may, have, been, chosen, over, interpreted, languages, because, of, its, speed, stability, and, near, universal, availability, it, is, no, longer, common, practice, for, web, development, to, be, done, in, c, and, many, other, web, development, tools, exist, the, two, most, popular, web, servers, apache, http, server, and, nginx, are, both, written, in, c, these, web, servers, interact, with, the, operating, system, listen, on, tcp, ports, for, http, requests, and, then, serve, up, static, web, content, or, cause, the, execution, of, other, languages, handling, to, render, content, such, as, php, which, is, itself, primarily, written, in, c, c, s, close, to, the, metal, approach, allows, for, the, construction, of, these, high, performance, software, systems, c, has, also, been, widely, used, to, implement, end, user, applications, however, such, applications, can, also, be, written, in, newer, higher, level, languages, the, power, of, assembly, language, and, the, convenience, of, assembly, language, while, c, has, been, popular, influential, and, hugely, successful, it, has, drawbacks, including, for, some, purposes, restricted, styles, of, c, have, been, adopted, e, g, misra, c, or, cert, c, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, opportunity, for, bugs, databases, such, as, cwe, attempt, to, count, the, ways, c, etc, has, vulnerabilities, along, with, recommendations, for, mitigation, there, are, tools, that, can, mitigate, against, some, of, the, drawbacks, contemporary, c, compilers, include, checks, which, may, generate, warnings, to, help, identify, many, potential, bugs, c, has, both, directly, and, indirectly, influenced, many, later, languages, such, as, c, and, java, the, most, pervasive, influence, has, been, syntactical, all, of, the, languages, mentioned, combine, the, statement, and, more, or, less, recognizably, expression, syntax, of, c, with, type, systems, data, models, or, large, scale, program, structures, that, differ, from, those, of, c, sometimes, radically, several, c, or, near, c, interpreters, exist, including, ch, and, cint, which, can, also, be, used, for, scripting, when, object, oriented, programming, languages, became, popular, c, and, objective, c, were, two, different, extensions, of, c, that, provided, object, oriented, capabilities, both, languages, were, originally, implemented, as, source, to, source, compilers, source, code, was, translated, into, c, and, then, compiled, with, a, c, compiler, the, c, programming, language, originally, named, c, with, classes, was, devised, by, bjarne, stroustrup, as, an, approach, to, providing, object, oriented, functionality, with, a, c, like, syntax, c, adds, greater, typing, strength, scoping, and, other, tools, useful, in, object, oriented, programming, and, permits, generic, programming, via, templates, nearly, a, superset, of, c, c, now, supports, most, of, c, with, a, few, exceptions, objective, c, was, originally, a, very, thin, layer, on, top, of, c, and, remains, a, strict, superset, of, c, that, permits, object, oriented, programming, using, a, hybrid, dynamic, static, typing, paradigm, objective, c, derives, its, syntax, from, both, c, and, smalltalk, syntax, that, involves, preprocessing, expressions, function, declarations, and, function, calls, is, inherited, from, c, while, the, syntax, for, object, oriented, features, was, originally, taken, from, smalltalk, in, addition, to, c, and, objective, c, ch, cilk, and, unified, parallel, c, are, nearly, supersets, of, c
