months, and, years, the, traditional, calendar, used, the, sexagenary, cycle, based, ganzhi, system, s, mathematically, repeating, cycles, of, heavenly, stems, and, earthly, branches, together, with, astronomical, horological, and, phenologic, observations, definitions, measurements, and, predictions, of, years, months, and, days, were, refined, to, an, accurate, standard, astronomical, phenomena, and, calculations, emphasized, especially, the, efforts, to, mathematically, correlate, the, solar, and, lunar, cycles, from, the, perspective, of, the, earth, which, however, are, known, to, require, some, degree, of, numeric, approximation, or, compromises, the, logic, of, the, various, permutations, of, the, chinese, calendar, has, been, based, in, considerations, such, as, the, technical, form, from, mathematics, and, astronomy, the, philosophical, considerations, and, the, political, and, the, resulting, disparities, between, different, calendars, is, significantly, notable, various,

methods, of, computing, years, eras, months, days, and, hours, with, modern, horology, even, splitting, the, seconds, into, very, tiny, sub, units, using, atomic, methods, epochs, are, one, of, the, important, features, of, calendar, systems, an, epoch, is, a, particular, point, in, time, at, which, a, calendar, system, may, use, as, its, initial, time, reference, allowing, for, the, consecutive, numbering, of, years, from, a, chosen, starting, year, date, or, time, in, the, chinese, calendar, system, examples, include, the, inauguration, of, huangdi, or, the, birth, of, confucius, also, many, dynasties, had, their, own, dating, systems, which, could, include, regnal, eras, based, on, the, inauguration, of, a, dynasty, the, enthronement, of, a, particular, monarch, or, eras, arbitrarily, designated, due, to, political, or, other, considerations, such, as, a, desire, for, a, change, of, luck, era, names, are, useful, for, determining, dates, on, artifacts, such, as, ceramics, which, were, often, traditionally, dated, by, an, era, name, during, the, production, process, historical, variations, of, the, lunisolar, calendar, are, features, of, the, chinese, calendar, system, the, topic, of, the, chinese, calendar, includes, various, traditional, types, of, the, chinese, calendar, as, is, generally, the, case, with, calendar, systems, the, chinese, calendars, tend, to, focus, on, basic, calendar, functions, such, as, the, identification, of, years, months, and, days, according, to, astronomical, phenomena, and, calculations, with, a, special, effort, to, correlate, the, solar, and, lunar, cycles, experienced, on, earth, an, effort, which, is, known, to, mathematically, require, some, degree, of, approximation, one, of, the, major, features, of, some, traditional, calendar, systems, in, china, and, elsewhere, has, been, the, idea, of, the, sexagenary, cycle, the, chinese, lunisolar, calendar, has, had, several, significant, variations, over, the, course, of, time, and, history, many, historical, variations, in, the, chinese, calendar, are, associated, with, political, changes, such, as, dynastic, succession, solar, and, agricultural, calendars, have, a, long, history, in, china, purely, lunar, calendar, systems, were, known, in, china, however, purely, lunar, calendars, tended, to, be, of, limited, utility, and, were, not, widely, accepted, by, farmers, who, for, agricultural, purposes, needed, to, focus, on, predictability, of, seasons, for, planting, and, harvesting, purposes, and, thus, required, a, calendar, useful, for, agricultural, for, farming, purposes, and, keeping, track, of, the, seasons, chinese, solar, or, lunisolar, calendars, were, particularly, useful, thus, over, time, the, publication, of, multipurpose, and, agricultural, almanacs, has, become, a, longstanding, tradition, in, china, various, other, astronomical, phenomena, have, been, incorporated, into, calendars, besides, the, cycles, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, for, example, the, planets, and, the, constellations, or, mansions, of, asterisms, along, the, ecliptic, many, chinese, holidays, and, other, areas, both, in, ancient, and, modern, times, have, been, determined, by, the, traditional, lunisolar, calendar, or, considerations, based, upon, the, lunisolar, calendar, and, which, now, are, generally, combined, with, more, modern, calendar, considerations, the, traditions, of, the, lunisolar, calendar, remain, very, popular, and, the, gregorian, calendar, has, been, used, as, the, standard, basis, for, civic, calendars, the, name, of, calendar, is, in, chinese, pinyin, l, and, was, represented, in, earlier, character, forms, variants, and, ultimately, derived, from, an, ancient, form, the, ancient, form, of, the, character, consists, of, two, stalks, of, rice, plant, arranged, in, parallel, this, character, represents, the, order, in, space, and, also, the, order, in, time, as, its, meaning, became, complex, the, modern, dedicated, character, was, created, to, represent, the, meaning, of, calendar, maintaining, the, correctness, of, calendars, was, an, important, task, to, maintain, the, authority, of, rulers, being, perceived, as, a, way, to, measure, the, ability, of, a, ruler, for, example, someone, seen, as, a, competent, ruler, would, foresee, the, coming, of, seasons, and, prepare, accordingly, this, understanding, was, also, relevant, in, predicting, abnormalities, of, the, earth, and, celestial, bodies, such, as, lunar, and, solar, eclipses, the, significant, relationship, between, authority, and, timekeeping, helps, to, explain, why, there, are, 102, calendars, in, chinese, history, trying, to, predict, the, correct, courses, of, sun, moon, and, stars, and, marking, good, time, and, bad, time, each, calendar, is, named, as, xx, and, recorded, in, a, dedicated, calendar, section, in, history, books, of, different, eras, the, last, one, in, imperial, era, was, a, ruler, would, issue,

observations, have, been, based, on, the, calendar, the, government, finally, compromised, and, rebranded, it, as, the, agricultural, calendar, in, 1947, depreciating, the, calendar, to, merely, agricultural, use, after, the, end, of, the, imperial, era, there, are, some, almanacs, based, upon, the, algorithm, of, the, last, imperial, calendar, with, longitude, of, peking, such, almanacs, were, under, the, name, of, universal, book, or, under, cantonese, name, transcribed, as, tung, shing, and, later, these, almanacs, moved, to, new, calculation, based, on, the, location, of, purple,

although, lunar, months, were, originally, named, according, to, natural, phenomena, phenology, each, month, is, also, associated, with, one, of, the, twelve, earthly, branches, correspondences, with, gregorian, dates, are, approximate, and, should, be, used, with, caution, many, years, have, intercalary, months, though, the, numbered, month, names, are, often, used, for, the, corresponding, month, number, in, the, gregorian, calendar, it, is, important, to, realize, that, the, numbered, month, names, are, not, interchangeable, with, the, gregorian, months, when, talking, about, lunar, dates, one, may, identify, the, heavenly, stem, and, earthly, branch, corresponding, to, a, particular, day, in, the, month, and, those, corresponding, to, its, month, and, those, to, its, year, to, determine, the, four, pillars, of, destiny, associated, with, it, for, which, the, tung, shing, also, referred, to, as, the, chinese, almanac, of, the, year, or, the, huangli, and, containing, the, essential, information, concerning, chinese, astrology, is, the, most, convenient, publication, to, consult, days, rotate, through, a, sexagenary, cycle, marked, by, coordination, between, heavenly, stems, and, earthly, branches, hence, the, referral, to, the, four, pillars, of, destiny, as, bazi, or, birth, time, eight, characters, with, each, pillar, consisting, of, a, character, for, its, corresponding, heavenly, stem, and, another, for, its, earthly, branch, since, huangli, days, are, sexagenaric, their, order, is, quite, independent, of, their, numeric, order, in, each, month, and, of, their, numeric, order, within, a, week, referred, to, as, true, animals, in, relation, to, the, chinese, zodiac, therefore, it, does, require, painstaking, calculation, for, one, to, arrive, at, the, four, pillars, of, destiny, of, a, particular, given, date, which, rarely, outpaces, the, convenience, of, simply, consulting, the, huangli, by, looking, up, its, gregorian, date, the, solar, year, su, the, time, between, winter, solstices, is, divided, into, 24, solar, terms, known, as, ji, q, each, term, is, a, 15, portion, of, the, ecliptic, these, solar, terms, mark, both, western, and, chinese, seasons, as, well, as, equinoxes, solstices, and, other, chinese, events, the, even, solar, terms, marked, with, z, for, chinese, zhongqi, are, considered, the, major, terms, while, the, odd, solar, terms, marked, with, j, for, chinese, jieqi, are, deemed, minor, the, solar, terms, q, ng, m, ng, on, 5, april, and, d, ng, zh, on, 22, december, are, both, celebrated, events, in, china, the, calendar, solar, year, known, as, the, su, begins, on, the, december, solstice, and, proceeds, through, the, 24, solar, terms, since, the, speed, of, the, sun, s, apparent, motion, in, the, elliptical, is, variable, the, time, between, major, solar, terms, is, not, fixed, this, variation, in, time, between, major, solar, terms, results, in, different, solar, year, lengths, there, are, generally, 11, or, 12, complete, months, plus, two, incomplete, months, around, the, winter, solstice, in, a, solar, year, the, complete, months, are, numbered, from, 0, to, 10, and, the, incomplete, months, are, considered, the, 11th, month, if, there, are, 12, complete, months, in, the, solar, year, it, is, known, as, a, leap, solar, year, or, leap, su, due, to, the, inconsistencies, in, the, length, of, the, solar, year, different, versions, of, the, traditional, calendar, might, have, different, average, solar, year, lengths, for, example, one, solar, year, of, the, 1st, century, bce, t, ich, calendar, is, 365, 385, 1539, 365, 25016, days, a, solar, year, of, the, 13th, century, sh, ush, calendar, is, 365, 97, 400, 365, 2425, days, identical, to, the, gregorian, calendar, the,

pre, climate, ji, q, and, the, second, is, mid, climate, zh, ngq, if, there, are, 12, complete, months, within, a, solar, year, the, first, month, without, a, mid, climate, is, the, leap, or, intercalary, month, in, other, words, the, first, month, that, does, not, include, a, major, solar, term, is, the, leap, month, leap, months, are, numbered, with, r, n, the, character, for, intercalary, plus, the, name, of, the, month, they, follow, in, 2017, the, intercalary, month, after, month, six, was, called, r, n, li, yu, or, intercalary, sixth, month, and, written, as, 6i, or, 6, the, next, intercalary, month, in, 2020, after, month, four, will, be, called, r, n, s, yu, and, written, 4i, or, 4, the, lunisolar, year, begins, with, the, first, spring, month, zh, ngyu, capital,

new, year, years, were, traditionally, numbered, by, the, reign, in, ancient, china, but, this, was, abolished, after, founding, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, for, example, the, year, from, 12, february, 2021, to, 31, january, 2022, was, a, x, nch, u, year, of, 12, months, or, 354, days, the, tang, dynasty, used, the, earthly, branches, to, mark, the, months, from, december, 761, to, may, 762, over, this, period, the, year, began, with, the, winter, solstice, in, modern, china, a, person, s, official, age, is, based, on, the, gregorian, calendar, for, traditional, use, age,

therefore, is, the, number, of, chinese, calendar, years, in, which, they, have, lived, due, to, the, potential, for, confusion, the, age, of, infants, is, often, given, in, months, instead, of, years, after, the, gregorian, calendar, was, introduced, in, china, the, chinese, traditional, age, was, referred, to, as, the, nominal, age, x, su, incomplete, age, and, the, gregorian, age, was,

was, used, the, 60, stem, branches, have, been, used, to, mark, the, date, since, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, bce, 1046, bce, astrologers, knew, that, the, orbital, period, of, jupiter, is, about, 12, 361, 4332, days, which, they, divided, period, into, 12, years, su, of, 361, days, each, the, stem, branches, system, solved, the, era, system, s, problem, of, unequal, reign, lengths, the, date, of, the, chinese, new, year, accords, with, the, patterns, of, the, lunisolar, calendar, and, hence, is, variable, from, year, to, year, the, invariant, between, years, is, that, the, winter, solstice, dongzhi, is, required, to, be, in, the, eleventh, month, of, the, year, this, means, that, chinese, new, year, will, be, on, the, second, new, moon, after, the, previous, winter, solstice, unless, there, is, a, leap, month, 11, or, 12, in, the, previous, year, this, rule, is, accurate, however, there, are, two, other, mostly, but, not, completely, accurate, rules, that, are, commonly, stated, it, has, been, found, that, chinese, new, year, moves, back, by, either, 10, 11, or, 12, days, in, most, years, if, it, falls, on, or, before, 31, january, then, it, moves, forward, in, the, next, year, by, either, 18, 19, or, 20, days, though, the, numbered, month, names, are, often, used, for, the, corresponding, month, number, in, the, gregorian, calendar, it, is, important, to, realize, that, the, numbered, month, names, are, not, interchangeable, with, the, gregorian, months, when, talking, about, lunar, dates, various, traditional, and, religious, holidays, shared, by, communities,
