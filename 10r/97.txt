ethernet, i, r, n, t, ee, th, r, net, is, a, family, of, wired, computer, networking, technologies, commonly, used, in, local, area, networks, lan, metropolitan, area, networks, man, and, wide, area, networks, wan, it, was, commercially, introduced, in, 1980, and, first, standardized, in, 1983, as, ieee, 802, 3, ethernet, has, since, been, refined, to, support, higher, bit, rates, a, greater, number, of, nodes, and, longer, link, distances, but, retains, much, backward, compatibility, over, time, ethernet, has, largely, replaced, competing, wired, lan, technologies, such, as, token, ring, fddi, and, arcnet, the, original, 10base5, ethernet, uses, a, thick, coaxial, cable, as, a, shared, medium, this, was, largely, superseded, by, 10base2, which, used, a, thinner, and, more, flexible, cable, that, was, both, cheaper, and, easier, to, use, more, modern, ethernet, variants, use, twisted, pair, and, fiber, optic, links, in, conjunction, with, switches, over, the, course, of, its, history, ethernet, data, transfer, rates, have, been, increased, from, the, original, 2, 94, mbit, s, to, the, latest, 400, gbit, s, with, rates, up, to, 1, 6, tbit, s, under, development, the, ethernet, standards, include, several, wiring, and, signaling, variants, of, the, osi, physical, layer, systems, communicating, over, ethernet, divide, a, stream, of, data, into, shorter, pieces, called, frames, each, frame, contains, source, and, destination, addresses, and, error, checking, data, so, that, damaged, frames, can, be, detected, and, discarded, most, often, higher, layer, protocols, trigger, retransmission, of, lost, frames, per, the, osi, model, ethernet, provides, services, up, to, and, including, the, data, link, layer, the, 48, bit, mac, address, was, adopted, by, other, ieee, 802, networking, standards, including, ieee, 802, 11, wi, fi, as, well, as, by, fddi, ethertype, values, are, also, used, in, subnetwork, access, protocol, snap, headers, ethernet, is, widely, used, in, homes, and, industry, and, interworks, well, with, wireless, wi, fi, technologies, the, internet, protocol, is, commonly, carried, over, ethernet, and, so, it, is, considered, one, of, the, key, technologies, that, make, up, the, internet, ethernet, was, developed, at, xerox, parc, between, 1973, and, 1974, as, a, means, to, allow, alto, computers, to, communicate, with, each, other, it, was, inspired, by, alohanet, which, robert, metcalfe, had, studied, as, part, of, his, phd, dissertation, and, was, originally, called, the, alto, aloha, network, metcalfe, s, idea, was, essentially, to, limit, the, aloha, like, signals, inside, a, cable, instead, of, broadcasting, into, the, air, the, idea, was, first, documented, in, a, memo, that, metcalfe, wrote, on, may, 22, 1973, where, he, named, it, after, the, luminiferous, aether, once, postulated, to, exist, as, an, omnipresent, completely, passive, medium, for, the, propagation, of, electromagnetic, waves, in, 1975, xerox, filed, a, patent, application, listing, metcalfe, david, boggs, chuck, thacker, and, butler, lampson, as, inventors, in, 1976, after, the, system, was, deployed, at, parc, metcalfe, and, boggs, published, a, seminal, paper, ron, crane, yogen, dalal, robert, garner, hal, murray, roy, ogus, dave, redell, and, john, shoch, facilitated, the, upgrade, from, the, original, 2, 94, mbit, s, protocol, to, the, 10, mbit, s, protocol, which, was, released, to, the, market, in, 1980, metcalfe, left, xerox, in, june, 1979, to, form, 3com, he, convinced, digital, equipment, corporation, dec, intel, and, xerox, to, work, together, to, promote, ethernet, as, a, standard, as, part, of, that, process, xerox, agreed, to, relinquish, their, ethernet, trademark, the, first, standard, was, published, on, september, 30, 1980, as, the, ethernet, a, local, area, network, data, link, layer, and, physical, layer, specifications, this, so, called, dix, standard, digital, intel, xerox, specified, 10, mbit, s, ethernet, with, 48, bit, destination, and, source, addresses, and, a, global, 16, bit, ethertype, type, field, version, 2, was, published, in, november, 1982, and, defines, what, has, become, known, as, ethernet, ii, formal, standardization, efforts, proceeded, at, the, same, time, and, resulted, in, the, publication, of, ieee, 802, 3, on, june, 23, 1983, ethernet, initially, competed, with, token, ring, and, other, proprietary, protocols, ethernet, was, able, to, adapt, to, market, needs, and, with, 10base2, shift, to, inexpensive, thin, coaxial, cable, and, from, 1990, to, the, now, ubiquitous, twisted, pair, with, 10base, t, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, ethernet, was, clearly, the, dominant, network, technology, in, the, process, 3com, became, a, major, company, 3com, shipped, its, first, 10, mbit, s, ethernet, 3c100, nic, in, march, 1981, and, that, year, started, selling, adapters, for, pdp, 11s, and, vaxes, as, well, as, multibus, based, intel, and, sun, microsystems, computers, 9, this, was, followed, quickly, by, dec, s, unibus, to, ethernet, adapter, which, dec, sold, and, used, internally, to, build, its, own, corporate, network, which, reached, over, 10, 000, nodes, by, 1986, making, it, one, of, the, largest, computer, networks, in, the, world, at, that, time, an, ethernet, adapter, card, for, the, ibm, pc, was, released, in, 1982, and, by, 1985, 3com, had, sold, 100, 000, in, the, 1980s, ibm, s, own, pc, network, product, competed, with, ethernet, for, the, pc, and, through, the, 1980s, lan, hardware, in, general, was, not, common, on, pcs, however, in, the, mid, to, late, 1980s, pc, networking, did, become, popular, in, offices, and, schools, for, printer, and, fileserver, sharing, and, among, the, many, diverse, competing, lan, technologies, of, that, decade, ethernet, was, one, of, the, most, popular, parallel, port, based, ethernet, adapters, were, produced, for, a, time, with, drivers, for, dos, and, windows, by, the, early, 1990s, ethernet, became, so, prevalent, that, ethernet, ports, began, to, appear, on, some, pcs, and, most, workstations, this, process, was, greatly, sped, up, with, the, introduction, of, 10base, t, and, its, relatively, small, modular, connector, at, which, point, ethernet, ports, appeared, even, on, low, end, motherboards, since, then, ethernet, technology, has, evolved, to, meet, new, bandwidth, and, market, requirements, in, addition, to, computers, ethernet, is, now, used, to, interconnect, appliances, and, other, personal, devices, as, industrial, ethernet, it, is, used, in, industrial, applications, and, is, quickly, replacing, legacy, data, transmission, systems, in, the, world, s, telecommunications, networks, by, 2010, the, market, for, ethernet, equipment, amounted, to, over, 16, billion, per, year, in, february, 1980, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, started, project, 802, to, standardize, local, area, networks, lan, the, dix, group, with, gary, robinson, dec, phil, arst, intel, and, bob, printis, xerox, submitted, the, so, called, blue, book, csma, cd, specification, as, a, candidate, for, the, lan, specification, in, addition, to, csma, cd, token, ring, supported, by, ibm, and, token, bus, selected, and, henceforward, supported, by, general, motors, were, also, considered, as, candidates, for, a, lan, standard, competing, proposals, and, broad, interest, in, the, initiative, led, to, strong, disagreement, over, which, technology, to, standardize, in, december, 1980, the, group, was, split, into, three, subgroups, and, standardization, proceeded, separately, for, each, proposal, delays, in, the, standards, process, put, at, risk, the, market, introduction, of, the, xerox, star, workstation, and, 3com, s, ethernet, lan, products, with, such, business, implications, in, mind, david, liddle, general, manager, xerox, office, systems, and, metcalfe, 3com, strongly, supported, a, proposal, of, fritz, r, scheisen, siemens, private, networks, for, an, alliance, in, the, emerging, office, communication, market, including, siemens, support, for, the, international, standardization, of, ethernet, april, 10, 1981, ingrid, fromm, siemens, representative, to, ieee, 802, quickly, achieved, broader, support, for, ethernet, beyond, ieee, by, the, establishment, of, a, competing, task, group, local, networks, within, the, european, standards, body, ecma, tc24, in, march, 1982, ecma, tc24, with, its, corporate, members, reached, an, agreement, on, a, standard, for, csma, cd, based, on, the, ieee, 802, draft, 8, because, the, dix, proposal, was, most, technically, complete, and, because, of, the, speedy, action, taken, by, ecma, which, decisively, contributed, to, the, conciliation, of, opinions, within, ieee, the, ieee, 802, 3, csma, cd, standard, was, approved, in, december, 1982, ieee, published, the, 802, 3, standard, as, a, draft, in, 1983, and, as, a, standard, in, 1985, approval, of, ethernet, on, the, international, level, was, achieved, by, a, similar, cross, partisan, action, with, fromm, as, the, liaison, officer, working, to, integrate, with, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, technical, committee, 83, and, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, technical, committee, 97, sub, committee, 6, the, iso, 8802, 3, standard, was, published, in, 1989, ethernet, has, evolved, to, include, higher, bandwidth, improved, medium, access, control, methods, and, different, physical, media, the, multidrop, coaxial, cable, was, replaced, with, physical, point, to, point, links, connected, by, ethernet, repeaters, or, switches, ethernet, stations, communicate, by, sending, each, other, data, packets, blocks, of, data, individually, sent, and, delivered, as, with, other, ieee, 802, lans, adapters, come, programmed, with, globally, unique, 48, bit, mac, address, so, that, each, ethernet, station, has, a, unique, address, the, mac, addresses, are, used, to, specify, both, the, destination, and, the, source, of, each, data, packet, ethernet, establishes, link, level, connections, which, can, be, defined, using, both, the, destination, and, source, addresses, on, reception, of, a, transmission, the, receiver, uses, the, destination, address, to, determine, whether, the, transmission, is, relevant, to, the, station, or, should, be, ignored, a, network, interface, normally, does, not, accept, packets, addressed, to, other, ethernet, stations, an, ethertype, field, in, each, frame, is, used, by, the, operating, system, on, the, receiving, station, to, select, the, appropriate, protocol, module, e, g, an, internet, protocol, version, such, as, ipv4, ethernet, frames, are, said, to, be, self, identifying, because, of, the, ethertype, field, self, identifying, frames, make, it, possible, to, intermix, multiple, protocols, on, the, same, physical, network, and, allow, a, single, computer, to, use, multiple, protocols, together, despite, the, evolution, of, ethernet, technology, all, generations, of, ethernet, excluding, early, experimental, versions, use, the, same, frame, formats, mixed, speed, networks, can, be, built, using, ethernet, switches, and, repeaters, supporting, the, desired, ethernet, variants, due, to, the, ubiquity, of, ethernet, and, the, ever, decreasing, cost, of, the, hardware, needed, to, support, it, by, 2004, most, manufacturers, built, ethernet, interfaces, directly, into, pc, motherboards, eliminating, the, need, for, a, separate, network, card, ethernet, was, originally, based, on, the, idea, of, computers, communicating, over, a, shared, coaxial, cable, acting, as, a, broadcast, transmission, medium, the, method, used, was, similar, to, those, used, in, radio, systems, with, the, common, cable, providing, the, communication, channel, likened, to, the, luminiferous, aether, in, 19th, century, physics, and, it, was, from, this, reference, that, the, name, ethernet, was, derived, original, ethernet, s, shared, coaxial, cable, the, shared, medium, traversed, a, building, or, campus, to, every, attached, machine, a, scheme, known, as, carrier, sense, multiple, access, with, collision, detection, csma, cd, governed, the, way, the, computers, shared, the, channel, this, scheme, was, simpler, than, competing, token, ring, or, token, bus, technologies, computers, are, connected, to, an, attachment, unit, interface, aui, transceiver, which, is, in, turn, connected, to, the, cable, with, thin, ethernet, the, transceiver, is, usually, integrated, into, the, network, adapter, while, a, simple, passive, wire, is, highly, reliable, for, small, networks, it, is, not, reliable, for, large, extended, networks, where, damage, to, the, wire, in, a, single, place, or, a, single, bad, connector, can, make, the, whole, ethernet, segment, unusable, through, the, first, half, of, the, 1980s, ethernet, s, 10base5, implementation, used, a, coaxial, cable, 0, 375, inches, 9, 5, mm, in, diameter, later, called, thick, ethernet, or, thicknet, its, successor, 10base2, called, thin, ethernet, or, thinnet, used, the, rg, 58, coaxial, cable, the, emphasis, was, on, making, installation, of, the, cable, easier, and, less, costly, 57, since, all, communication, happens, on, the, same, wire, any, information, sent, by, one, computer, is, received, by, all, even, if, that, information, is, intended, for, just, one, destination, the, network, interface, card, interrupts, the, cpu, only, when, applicable, packets, are, received, the, card, ignores, information, not, addressed, to, it, use, of, a, single, cable, also, means, that, the, data, bandwidth, is, shared, such, that, for, example, available, data, bandwidth, to, each, device, is, halved, when, two, stations, are, simultaneously, active, a, collision, happens, when, two, stations, attempt, to, transmit, at, the, same, time, they, corrupt, transmitted, data, and, require, stations, to, re, transmit, the, lost, data, and, re, transmission, reduces, throughput, in, the, worst, case, where, multiple, active, hosts, connected, with, maximum, allowed, cable, length, attempt, to, transmit, many, short, frames, excessive, collisions, can, reduce, throughput, dramatically, however, a, xerox, report, in, 1980, studied, performance, of, an, existing, ethernet, installation, under, both, normal, and, artificially, generated, heavy, load, the, report, claimed, that, 98, throughput, on, the, lan, was, observed, this, is, in, contrast, with, token, passing, lans, token, ring, token, bus, all, of, which, suffer, throughput, degradation, as, each, new, node, comes, into, the, lan, due, to, token, waits, this, report, was, controversial, as, modeling, showed, that, collision, based, networks, theoretically, became, unstable, under, loads, as, low, as, 37, of, nominal, capacity, many, early, researchers, failed, to, understand, these, results, performance, on, real, networks, is, significantly, better, in, a, modern, ethernet, the, stations, do, not, all, share, one, channel, through, a, shared, cable, or, a, simple, repeater, hub, instead, each, station, communicates, with, a, switch, which, in, turn, forwards, that, traffic, to, the, destination, station, in, this, topology, collisions, are, only, possible, if, station, and, switch, attempt, to, communicate, with, each, other, at, the, same, time, and, collisions, are, limited, to, this, link, furthermore, the, 10base, t, standard, introduced, a, full, duplex, mode, of, operation, which, became, common, with, fast, ethernet, and, the, de, facto, standard, with, gigabit, ethernet, in, full, duplex, switch, and, station, can, send, and, receive, simultaneously, and, therefore, modern, ethernets, are, completely, collision, free, for, signal, degradation, and, timing, reasons, coaxial, ethernet, segments, have, a, restricted, size, somewhat, larger, networks, can, be, built, by, using, an, ethernet, repeater, early, repeaters, had, only, two, ports, allowing, at, most, a, doubling, of, network, size, once, repeaters, with, more, than, two, ports, became, available, it, was, possible, to, wire, the, network, in, a, star, topology, early, experiments, with, star, topologies, called, fibernet, using, optical, fiber, were, published, by, 1978, shared, cable, ethernet, is, always, hard, to, install, in, offices, because, its, bus, topology, is, in, conflict, with, the, star, topology, cable, plans, designed, into, buildings, for, telephony, modifying, ethernet, to, conform, to, twisted, pair, telephone, wiring, already, installed, in, commercial, buildings, provided, another, opportunity, to, lower, costs, expand, the, installed, base, and, leverage, building, design, and, thus, twisted, pair, ethernet, was, the, next, logical, development, in, the, mid, 1980s, ethernet, on, unshielded, twisted, pair, cables, utp, began, with, starlan, at, 1, mbit, s, in, the, mid, 1980s, in, 1987, synoptics, introduced, the, first, twisted, pair, ethernet, at, 10, mbit, s, in, a, star, wired, cabling, topology, with, a, central, hub, later, called, lattisnet, 29, these, evolved, into, 10base, t, which, was, designed, for, point, to, point, links, only, and, all, termination, was, built, into, the, device, this, changed, repeaters, from, a, specialist, device, used, at, the, center, of, large, networks, to, a, device, that, every, twisted, pair, based, network, with, more, than, two, machines, had, to, use, the, tree, structure, that, resulted, from, this, made, ethernet, networks, easier, to, maintain, by, preventing, most, faults, with, one, peer, or, its, associated, cable, from, affecting, other, devices, on, the, network, despite, the, physical, star, topology, and, the, presence, of, separate, transmit, and, receive, channels, in, the, twisted, pair, and, fiber, media, repeater, based, ethernet, networks, still, use, half, duplex, and, csma, cd, with, only, minimal, activity, by, the, repeater, primarily, generation, of, the, jam, signal, in, dealing, with, packet, collisions, every, packet, is, sent, to, every, other, port, on, the, repeater, so, bandwidth, and, security, problems, are, not, addressed, the, total, throughput, of, the, repeater, is, limited, to, that, of, a, single, link, and, all, links, must, operate, at, the, same, speed, 278, while, repeaters, can, isolate, some, aspects, of, ethernet, segments, such, as, cable, breakages, they, still, forward, all, traffic, to, all, ethernet, devices, the, entire, network, is, one, collision, domain, and, all, hosts, have, to, be, able, to, detect, collisions, anywhere, on, the, network, this, limits, the, number, of, repeaters, between, the, farthest, nodes, and, creates, practical, limits, on, how, many, machines, can, communicate, on, an, ethernet, network, segments, joined, by, repeaters, have, to, all, operate, at, the, same, speed, making, phased, in, upgrades, impossible, to, alleviate, these, problems, bridging, was, created, to, communicate, at, the, data, link, layer, while, isolating, the, physical, layer, with, bridging, only, well, formed, ethernet, packets, are, forwarded, from, one, ethernet, segment, to, another, collisions, and, packet, errors, are, isolated, at, initial, startup, ethernet, bridges, work, somewhat, like, ethernet, repeaters, passing, all, traffic, between, segments, by, observing, the, source, addresses, of, incoming, frames, the, bridge, then, builds, an, address, table, associating, addresses, to, segments, once, an, address, is, learned, the, bridge, forwards, network, traffic, destined, for, that, address, only, to, the, associated, segment, improving, overall, performance, broadcast, traffic, is, still, forwarded, to, all, network, segments, bridges, also, overcome, the, limits, on, total, segments, between, two, hosts, and, allow, the, mixing, of, speeds, both, of, which, are, critical, to, the, incremental, deployment, of, faster, ethernet, variants, in, 1989, motorola, codex, introduced, their, 6310, etherspan, and, kalpana, introduced, their, etherswitch, these, were, examples, of, the, first, commercial, ethernet, switches, early, switches, such, as, this, used, cut, through, switching, where, only, the, header, of, the, incoming, packet, is, examined, before, it, is, either, dropped, or, forwarded, to, another, segment, this, reduces, the, forwarding, latency, one, drawback, of, this, method, is, that, it, does, not, readily, allow, a, mixture, of, different, link, speeds, another, is, that, packets, that, have, been, corrupted, are, still, propagated, through, the, network, the, eventual, remedy, for, this, was, a, return, to, the, original, store, and, forward, approach, of, bridging, where, the, packet, is, read, into, a, buffer, on, the, switch, in, its, entirety, its, frame, check, sequence, verified, and, only, then, the, packet, is, forwarded, in, modern, network, equipment, this, process, is, typically, done, using, application, specific, integrated, circuits, allowing, packets, to, be, forwarded, at, wire, speed, when, a, twisted, pair, or, fiber, link, segment, is, used, and, neither, end, is, connected, to, a, repeater, full, duplex, ethernet, becomes, possible, over, that, segment, in, full, duplex, mode, both, devices, can, transmit, and, receive, to, and, from, each, other, at, the, same, time, and, there, is, no, collision, domain, this, doubles, the, aggregate, bandwidth, of, the, link, and, is, sometimes, advertised, as, double, the, link, speed, for, example, 200, mbit, s, for, fast, ethernet, the, elimination, of, the, collision, domain, for, these, connections, also, means, that, all, the, link, s, bandwidth, can, be, used, by, the, two, devices, on, that, segment, and, that, segment, length, is, not, limited, by, the, constraints, of, collision, detection, since, packets, are, typically, delivered, only, to, the, port, they, are, intended, for, traffic, on, a, switched, ethernet, is, less, public, than, on, shared, medium, ethernet, despite, this, switched, ethernet, should, still, be, regarded, as, an, insecure, network, technology, because, it, is, easy, to, subvert, switched, ethernet, systems, by, means, such, as, arp, spoofing, and, mac, flooding, the, bandwidth, advantages, the, improved, isolation, of, devices, from, each, other, the, ability, to, easily, mix, different, speeds, of, devices, and, the, elimination, of, the, chaining, limits, inherent, in, non, switched, ethernet, have, made, switched, ethernet, the, dominant, network, technology, simple, switched, ethernet, networks, while, a, great, improvement, over, repeater, based, ethernet, suffer, from, single, points, of, failure, attacks, that, trick, switches, or, hosts, into, sending, data, to, a, machine, even, if, it, is, not, intended, for, it, scalability, and, security, issues, with, regard, to, switching, loops, broadcast, radiation, and, multicast, traffic, advanced, networking, features, in, switches, use, shortest, path, bridging, spb, or, the, spanning, tree, protocol, stp, to, maintain, a, loop, free, meshed, network, allowing, physical, loops, for, redundancy, stp, or, load, balancing, spb, shortest, path, bridging, includes, the, use, of, the, link, state, routing, protocol, is, is, to, allow, larger, networks, with, shortest, path, routes, between, devices, advanced, networking, features, also, ensure, port, security, provide, protection, features, such, as, mac, lockdown, and, broadcast, radiation, filtering, use, vlans, to, keep, different, classes, of, users, separate, while, using, the, same, physical, infrastructure, employ, multilayer, switching, to, route, between, different, classes, and, use, link, aggregation, to, add, bandwidth, to, overloaded, links, and, to, provide, some, redundancy, in, 2016, ethernet, replaced, infiniband, as, the, most, popular, system, interconnect, of, top500, supercomputers, the, ethernet, physical, layer, evolved, over, a, considerable, time, span, and, encompasses, coaxial, twisted, pair, and, fiber, optic, physical, media, interfaces, with, speeds, from, 1, mbit, s, to, 400, gbit, s, the, first, introduction, of, twisted, pair, csma, cd, was, starlan, standardized, as, 802, 3, 1base5, while, 1base5, had, little, market, penetration, it, defined, the, physical, apparatus, wire, plug, jack, pin, out, and, wiring, plan, that, would, be, carried, over, to, 10base, t, through, 10gbase, t, the, most, common, forms, used, are, 10base, t, 100base, tx, and, 1000base, t, all, three, use, twisted, pair, cables, and, 8p8c, modular, connectors, they, run, at, 10, mbit, s, 100, mbit, s, and, 1, gbit, s, respectively, fiber, optic, variants, of, ethernet, that, commonly, use, sfp, modules, are, also, very, popular, in, larger, networks, offering, high, performance, better, electrical, isolation, and, longer, distance, tens, of, kilometers, with, some, versions, in, general, network, protocol, stack, software, will, work, similarly, on, all, varieties, in, ieee, 802, 3, a, datagram, is, called, a, packet, or, frame, packet, is, used, to, describe, the, overall, transmission, unit, and, includes, the, preamble, start, frame, delimiter, sfd, and, carrier, extension, if, present, the, frame, begins, after, the, start, frame, delimiter, with, a, frame, header, featuring, source, and, destination, mac, addresses, and, the, ethertype, field, giving, either, the, protocol, type, for, the, payload, protocol, or, the, length, of, the, payload, the, middle, section, of, the, frame, consists, of, payload, data, including, any, headers, for, other, protocols, for, example, internet, protocol, carried, in, the, frame, the, frame, ends, with, a, 32, bit, cyclic, redundancy, check, which, is, used, to, detect, corruption, of, data, in, transit, sections, 3, 1, 1, and, 3, 2, notably, ethernet, packets, have, no, time, to, live, field, leading, to, possible, problems, in, the, presence, of, a, switching, loop, autonegotiation, is, the, procedure, by, which, two, connected, devices, choose, common, transmission, parameters, e, g, speed, and, duplex, mode, autonegotiation, was, initially, an, optional, feature, first, introduced, with, 100base, tx, 1995, ieee, 802, 3u, fast, ethernet, standard, and, is, backward, compatible, with, 10base, t, the, specification, was, improved, in, the, 1998, release, of, ieee, 802, 3, autonegotiation, is, mandatory, for, 1000base, t, and, faster, a, switching, loop, or, bridge, loop, occurs, in, computer, networks, when, there, is, more, than, one, layer, 2, osi, model, path, between, two, endpoints, e, g, multiple, connections, between, two, network, switches, or, two, ports, on, the, same, switch, connected, to, each, other, the, loop, creates, broadcast, storms, as, broadcasts, and, multicasts, are, forwarded, by, switches, out, every, port, the, switch, or, switches, will, repeatedly, rebroadcast, the, broadcast, messages, flooding, the, network, since, the, layer, 2, header, does, not, support, a, time, to, live, ttl, value, if, a, frame, is, sent, into, a, looped, topology, it, can, loop, forever, a, physical, topology, that, contains, switching, or, bridge, loops, is, attractive, for, redundancy, reasons, yet, a, switched, network, must, not, have, loops, the, solution, is, to, allow, physical, loops, but, create, a, loop, free, logical, topology, using, the, spb, protocol, or, the, older, stp, on, the, network, switches, a, node, that, is, sending, longer, than, the, maximum, transmission, window, for, an, ethernet, packet, is, considered, to, be, jabbering, depending, on, the, physical, topology, jabber, detection, and, remedy, differ, somewhat
