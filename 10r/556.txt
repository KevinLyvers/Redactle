https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar
the, julian, calendar, is, a, solar, calendar, of, 365, days, in, every, year, with, an, additional, leap, day, every, fourth, year, without, exception, the, julian, calendar, is, still, used, as, a, religious, calendar, in, parts, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, in, parts, of, oriental, orthodoxy, as, well, as, by, the, amazigh, people, also, known, as, the, berbers, the, julian, calendar, was, proposed, in, 46, bc, by, and, takes, its, name, from, julius, caesar, as, a, reform, of, the, earlier, roman, calendar, which, was, largely, a, lunisolar, one, it, took, effect, on, 1, january, 45, bc, by, his, edict, caesar, s, calendar, became, the, predominant, calendar, in, the, roman, empire, and, subsequently, most, of, the, western, world, for, more, than, 1, 600, years, until, 1582, when, pope, gregory, xiii, promulgated, a, revised, calendar, the, julian, calendar, has, two, types, of, years, a, normal, year, of, 365, days, and, a, leap, year, of, 366, days, they, follow, a, simple, cycle, of, three, normal, years, and, one, leap, year, giving, an, average, year, that, is, 365, 25, days, long, that, is, more, than, the, actual, solar, year, value, of, approximately, 365, 2422, days, the, current, value, which, varies, which, means, the, julian, calendar, gains, one, day, every, 129, years, in, other, words, the, julian, calendar, gains, 3, 1, days, every, 400, years, gregory, s, calendar, reform, modified, the, julian, rule, to, reduce, the, average, length, of, the, calendar, year, from, 365, 25, days, to, 365, 2425, days, and, thus, corrected, the, julian, calendar, s, drift, against, the, solar, year, the, gregorian, calendar, gains, just, 0, 1, day, over, 400, years, for, any, given, event, during, the, years, from, 1901, through, 2099, its, date, according, to, the, julian, calendar, is, 13, days, behind, its, corresponding, gregorian, date, for, instance, julian, 1, january, falls, on, gregorian, 14, january, most, catholic, countries, adopted, the, new, calendar, immediately, protestant, countries, did, so, slowly, in, the, course, of, the, following, two, centuries, or, so, most, orthodox, countries, retain, the, julian, calendar, for, religious, purposes, but, adopted, the, gregorian, as, their, civil, calendar, in, the, early, part, of, the, twentieth, century, the, ordinary, year, in, the, previous, roman, calendar, consisted, of, 12, months, for, a, total, of, 355, days, in, addition, a, 27, or, 28, day, intercalary, month, the, mensis, intercalaris, was, sometimes, inserted, between, february, and, march, this, intercalary, month, was, formed, by, inserting, 22, or, 23, days, after, the, first, 23, days, of, february, the, last, five, days, of, february, which, counted, down, toward, the, start, of, march, became, the, last, five, days, of, intercalaris, the, net, effect, was, to, add, 22, or, 23, days, to, the, year, forming, an, intercalary, year, of, 377, or, 378, days, some, say, the, mensis, intercalaris, always, had, 27, days, and, began, on, either, the, first, or, the, second, day, after, the, terminalia, 23, february, if, managed, correctly, this, system, could, have, allowed, the, roman, year, to, stay, roughly, aligned, to, a, tropical, year, however, since, the, pontifices, were, often, politicians, and, because, a, roman, magistrate, s, term, of, office, corresponded, with, a, calendar, year, this, power, was, prone, to, abuse, a, pontifex, could, lengthen, a, year, in, which, he, or, one, of, his, political, allies, was, in, office, or, refuse, to, lengthen, one, in, which, his, opponents, were, in, power, caesar, s, reform, was, intended, to, solve, this, problem, permanently, by, creating, a, calendar, that, remained, aligned, to, the, sun, without, any, human, intervention, this, proved, useful, very, soon, after, the, new, calendar, came, into, effect, varro, used, it, in, 37, bc, to, fix, calendar, dates, for, the, start, of, the, four, seasons, which, would, have, been, impossible, only, 8, years, earlier, a, century, later, when, pliny, dated, the, winter, solstice, to, 25, december, because, the, sun, entered, the, 8th, degree, of, capricorn, on, that, date, this, stability, had, become, an, ordinary, fact, of, life, although, the, approximation, of, 365, 1, 4, days, for, the, tropical, year, had, been, known, for, a, long, time, ancient, solar, calendars, had, used, less, precise, periods, resulting, in, gradual, misalignment, of, the, calendar, with, the, seasons, the, octaeteris, a, cycle, of, eight, lunar, years, popularised, by, cleostratus, and, also, commonly, attributed, to, eudoxus, which, was, used, in, some, early, greek, calendars, notably, in, athens, is, 1, 53, days, longer, than, eight, mean, julian, years, the, length, of, nineteen, years, in, the, cycle, of, meton, was, 6, 940, days, six, hours, longer, than, the, mean, julian, year, the, mean, julian, year, was, the, basis, of, the, 76, year, cycle, devised, by, callippus, a, student, under, eudoxus, to, improve, the, metonic, cycle, in, persia, iran, after, the, reform, in, the, persian, calendar, by, introduction, of, the, persian, zoroastrian, i, e, young, avestan, calendar, in, 503, bc, and, afterwards, the, first, day, of, the, year, 1, farvardin, nowruz, slipped, against, the, vernal, equinox, at, the, rate, of, approximately, one, day, every, four, years, likewise, in, the, egyptian, calendar, a, fixed, year, of, 365, days, was, in, use, drifting, by, one, day, against, the, sun, in, four, years, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, add, an, extra, day, every, fourth, year, was, made, in, 238, bc, decree, of, canopus, caesar, probably, experienced, this, wandering, or, vague, calendar, in, that, country, he, landed, in, the, nile, delta, in, october, 48, bc, and, soon, became, embroiled, in, the, ptolemaic, dynastic, war, especially, after, cleopatra, managed, to, be, introduced, to, him, in, alexandria, caesar, imposed, a, peace, and, a, banquet, was, held, to, celebrate, the, event, lucan, depicted, caesar, talking, to, a, wise, man, called, acoreus, during, the, feast, stating, his, intention, to, create, a, calendar, more, perfect, than, that, of, eudoxus, eudoxus, was, popularly, credited, with, having, determined, the, length, of, the, year, to, be, 365, 1, 4, days, but, the, war, soon, resumed, and, caesar, was, attacked, by, the, egyptian, army, for, several, months, until, he, achieved, victory, he, then, enjoyed, a, long, cruise, on, the, nile, with, cleopatra, before, leaving, the, country, in, june, 47, bc, caesar, returned, to, rome, in, 46, bc, and, according, to, plutarch, called, in, the, best, philosophers, and, mathematicians, of, his, time, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, calendar, pliny, says, that, caesar, was, aided, in, his, reform, by, the, astronomer, sosigenes, of, alexandria, who, is, generally, considered, the, principal, designer, of, the, reform, sosigenes, may, also, have, been, the, author, of, the, astronomical, almanac, published, by, caesar, to, facilitate, the, reform, eventually, it, was, decided, to, establish, a, calendar, that, would, be, a, combination, between, the, old, roman, months, the, fixed, length, of, the, egyptian, calendar, and, the, 365, 1, 4, days, of, greek, astronomy, according, to, macrobius, caesar, was, assisted, in, this, by, a, certain, marcus, flavius, caesar, s, reform, only, applied, to, the, roman, calendar, however, in, the, following, decades, many, of, the, local, civic, and, provincial, calendars, of, the, empire, and, neighbouring, client, kingdoms, were, aligned, to, the, julian, calendar, by, transforming, them, into, calendars, with, years, of, 365, days, with, an, extra, day, intercalated, every, four, years, the, reformed, calendars, typically, retained, many, features, of, the, unreformed, calendars, in, many, cases, the, new, year, was, not, on, 1, january, the, leap, day, was, not, on, the, traditional, bissextile, day, the, old, month, names, were, retained, the, lengths, of, the, reformed, months, did, not, match, the, lengths, of, julian, months, and, even, if, they, did, their, first, days, did, not, match, the, first, day, of, the, corresponding, julian, month, nevertheless, since, the, reformed, calendars, had, fixed, relationships, to, each, other, and, to, the, julian, calendar, the, process, of, converting, dates, between, them, became, quite, straightforward, through, the, use, of, conversion, tables, known, as, hemerologia, the, three, most, important, of, these, calendars, are, the, alexandrian, calendar, and, the, ancient, macedonian, calendar, which, had, two, forms, the, syro, macedonian, and, the, asian, calendars, other, reformed, calendars, are, known, from, cappadocia, cyprus, and, the, cities, of, roman, syria, and, palestine, unreformed, calendars, continued, to, be, used, in, gaul, the, coligny, calendar, greece, macedon, the, balkans, and, parts, of, palestine, most, notably, in, judea, the, asian, calendar, was, an, adaptation, of, the, ancient, macedonian, calendar, used, in, the, roman, province, of, asia, and, with, minor, variations, in, nearby, cities, and, provinces, it, is, known, in, detail, through, the, survival, of, decrees, promulgating, it, issued, in, 8, bc, by, the, proconsul, paullus, fabius, maximus, it, renamed, the, first, month, dios, as, kaisar, and, arranged, the, months, such, that, each, month, started, on, the, ninth, day, before, the, kalends, of, the, corresponding, roman, month, thus, the, year, began, on, 23, september, augustus, s, birthday, the, first, step, of, the, reform, was, to, realign, the, start, of, the, calendar, year, 1, january, to, the, tropical, year, by, making, 46, bc, 445, days, long, compensating, for, the, intercalations, which, had, been, missed, during, caesar, s, pontificate, this, year, had, already, been, extended, from, 355, to, 378, days, by, the, insertion, of, a, regular, intercalary, month, in, february, when, caesar, decreed, the, reform, probably, shortly, after, his, return, from, the, african, campaign, in, late, quintilis, july, he, added, 67, more, days, by, inserting, two, extraordinary, intercalary, months, between, november, and, december, these, months, are, called, intercalaris, prior, and, intercalaris, posterior, in, letters, of, cicero, written, at, the, time, there, is, no, basis, for, the, statement, sometimes, seen, that, they, were, called, undecimber, and, duodecimber, terms, that, arose, in, the, 18th, century, over, a, millennium, after, the, roman, empire, s, collapse, their, individual, lengths, are, unknown, as, is, the, position, of, the, nones, and, ides, within, them, because, 46, bc, was, the, last, of, a, series, of, irregular, years, this, extra, long, year, was, and, is, referred, to, as, the, last, year, of, confusion, the, new, calendar, began, operation, after, the, realignment, had, been, completed, in, 45, bc, the, julian, months, were, formed, by, adding, ten, days, to, a, regular, pre, julian, roman, year, of, 355, days, creating, a, regular, julian, year, of, 365, days, two, extra, days, were, added, to, january, sextilis, august, and, december, and, one, extra, day, was, added, to, april, june, september, and, november, february, was, not, changed, in, ordinary, years, and, so, continued, to, be, the, traditional, 28, days, thus, the, ordinary, i, e, non, leap, year, lengths, of, all, of, the, months, were, set, by, the, julian, calendar, to, the, same, values, they, still, hold, today, the, julian, reform, did, not, change, the, method, used, to, account, days, of, the, month, in, the, pre, julian, calendar, based, on, the, kalends, nones, and, ides, nor, did, it, change, the, positions, of, these, three, dates, within, the, months, macrobius, states, that, the, extra, days, were, added, immediately, before, the, last, day, of, each, month, to, avoid, disturbing, the, position, of, the, established, religious, ceremonies, relative, to, the, nones, and, ides, of, the, month, the, inserted, days, were, all, initially, characterised, as, dies, fasti, f, see, roman, calendar, the, character, of, a, few, festival, days, was, changed, in, the, early, julio, claudian, period, a, large, number, of, festivals, were, decreed, to, celebrate, events, of, dynastic, importance, which, caused, the, character, of, the, associated, dates, to, be, changed, to, np, however, this, practice, was, discontinued, around, the, reign, of, claudius, and, the, practice, of, characterising, days, fell, into, disuse, around, the, end, of, the, first, century, ad, the, antonine, jurist, gaius, speaks, of, dies, nefasti, as, a, thing, of, the, past, the, old, intercalary, month, was, abolished, the, new, leap, day, was, dated, as, ante, diem, bis, sextum, kalendas, martias, the, sixth, doubled, day, before, the, kalends, of, march, usually, abbreviated, as, a, d, bis, vi, kal, mart, hence, it, is, called, in, english, the, bissextile, day, the, year, in, which, it, occurred, was, termed, annus, bissextus, in, english, the, bissextile, year, there, is, debate, about, the, exact, position, of, the, bissextile, day, in, the, early, julian, calendar, the, earliest, direct, evidence, is, a, statement, of, the, 2nd, century, jurist, celsus, who, states, that, there, were, two, halves, of, a, 48, hour, day, and, that, the, intercalated, day, was, the, posterior, half, an, inscription, from, ad, 168, states, that, a, d, v, kal, mart, was, the, day, after, the, bissextile, day, the, 19th, century, chronologist, ideler, argued, that, celsus, used, the, term, posterior, in, a, technical, fashion, to, refer, to, the, earlier, of, the, two, days, which, requires, the, inscription, to, refer, to, the, whole, 48, hour, day, as, the, bissextile, some, later, historians, share, this, view, others, following, mommsen, take, the, view, that, celsus, was, using, the, ordinary, latin, and, english, meaning, of, posterior, a, third, view, is, that, neither, half, of, the, 48, hour, bis, sextum, was, originally, formally, designated, as, intercalated, but, that, the, need, to, do, so, arose, as, the, concept, of, a, 48, hour, day, became, obsolete, there, is, no, doubt, that, the, bissextile, day, eventually, became, the, earlier, of, the, two, days, for, most, purposes, in, 238, censorinus, stated, that, it, was, inserted, after, the, terminalia, 23, february, and, was, followed, by, the, last, five, days, of, february, i, e, a, d, vi, v, iv, iii, and, prid, kal, mart, which, would, be, 24, to, 28, february, in, a, common, year, and, the, 25th, to, 29th, in, a, leap, year, hence, he, regarded, the, bissextum, as, the, first, half, of, the, doubled, day, all, later, writers, including, macrobius, about, 430, bede, in, 725, and, other, medieval, computists, calculators, of, easter, followed, this, rule, as, does, the, liturgical, calendar, of, the, roman, catholic, church, however, celsus, definition, continued, to, be, used, for, legal, purposes, it, was, incorporated, into, justinian, s, digest, and, in, the, english, statute, de, anno, et, die, bissextili, of, 1236, which, was, not, formally, repealed, until, 1879, the, effect, of, the, bissextile, day, on, the, nundinal, cycle, is, not, discussed, in, the, sources, according, to, dio, cassius, a, leap, day, was, inserted, in, 41, bc, to, ensure, that, the, first, market, day, of, 40, bc, did, not, fall, on, 1, january, which, implies, that, the, old, 8, day, cycle, was, not, immediately, affected, by, the, julian, reform, however, he, also, reports, that, in, ad, 44, and, on, some, previous, occasions, the, market, day, was, changed, to, avoid, a, conflict, with, a, religious, festival, this, may, indicate, that, a, single, nundinal, letter, was, assigned, to, both, halves, of, the, 48, hour, bissextile, day, by, this, time, so, that, the, regifugium, and, the, market, day, might, fall, on, the, same, date, but, on, different, days, in, any, case, the, 8, day, nundinal, cycle, began, to, be, displaced, by, the, 7, day, week, in, the, first, century, ad, and, dominical, letters, began, to, appear, alongside, nundinal, letters, in, the, fasti, the, julian, calendar, has, two, types, of, year, normal, years, of, 365, days, and, leap, years, of, 366, days, there, is, a, simple, cycle, of, three, normal, years, followed, by, a, leap, year, and, this, pattern, repeats, forever, without, exception, the, julian, year, is, therefore, on, average, 365, 25, days, long, consequently, the, julian, year, drifts, over, time, with, respect, to, the, tropical, solar, year, 365, 24217, days, although, greek, astronomers, had, known, at, least, since, hipparchus, a, century, before, the, julian, reform, that, the, tropical, year, was, slightly, shorter, than, 365, 25, days, the, calendar, did, not, compensate, for, this, difference, as, a, result, the, calendar, year, gains, about, three, days, every, four, centuries, compared, to, observed, equinox, times, and, the, seasons, this, discrepancy, was, largely, corrected, by, the, gregorian, reform, of, 1582, the, gregorian, calendar, has, the, same, months, and, month, lengths, as, the, julian, calendar, but, in, the, gregorian, calendar, year, numbers, evenly, divisible, by, 100, are, not, leap, years, except, that, those, evenly, divisible, by, 400, remain, leap, years, even, then, the, gregorian, calendar, diverges, from, astronomical, observations, by, one, day, in, 3, 030, years, although, the, new, calendar, was, much, simpler, than, the, pre, julian, calendar, the, pontifices, initially, added, a, leap, day, every, three, years, instead, of, every, four, there, are, accounts, of, this, in, solinus, pliny, ammianus, suetonius, and, censorinus, macrobius, gives, the, following, account, of, the, introduction, of, the, julian, calendar, caesar, s, regulation, of, the, civil, year, to, accord, with, his, revised, measurement, was, proclaimed, publicly, by, edict, and, the, arrangement, might, have, continued, to, stand, had, not, the, correction, itself, of, the, calendar, led, the, priests, to, introduce, a, new, error, of, their, own, for, they, proceeded, to, insert, the, intercalary, day, which, represented, the, four, quarter, days, at, the, beginning, of, each, fourth, year, instead, of, at, its, end, although, the, intercalation, ought, to, have, been, made, at, the, end, of, each, fourth, year, and, before, the, beginning, of, the, fifth, this, error, continued, for, thirty, six, years, by, which, time, twelve, intercalary, days, had, been, inserted, instead, of, the, number, actually, due, namely, nine, but, when, this, error, was, at, length, recognised, it, too, was, corrected, by, an, order, of, augustus, that, twelve, years, should, be, allowed, to, pass, without, an, intercalary, day, since, the, sequence, of, twelve, such, years, would, account, for, the, three, days, which, in, the, course, of, thirty, six, years, had, been, introduced, by, the, premature, actions, of, the, priests, so, according, to, macrobius, some, people, have, had, different, ideas, as, to, how, the, leap, years, went, the, above, scheme, is, that, of, scaliger, 1583, in, the, table, below, he, established, that, the, augustan, reform, was, instituted, in, 8, bc, the, table, below, shows, for, each, reconstruction, the, implied, proleptic, julian, date, for, the, first, day, of, caesar, s, reformed, calendar, and, the, first, julian, date, on, which, the, roman, calendar, date, matches, the, julian, calendar, after, the, completion, of, augustus, reform, by, the, systems, of, scaliger, ideler, and, b, nting, the, leap, years, prior, to, the, suspension, happen, to, be, bc, years, that, are, divisible, by, 3, just, as, after, leap, year, resumption, they, are, the, ad, years, divisible, by, 4, pierre, brind, amour, argued, that, only, one, day, was, intercalated, between, 1, 1, 45, and, 1, 1, 40, disregarding, a, momentary, fiddling, in, december, of, 41, to, avoid, the, nundinum, falling, on, kal, ian, alexander, jones, says, that, the, correct, julian, calendar, was, in, use, in, egypt, in, 24, bc, implying, that, the, first, day, of, the, reform, in, both, egypt, and, rome, 1, january, 45, bc, was, the, julian, date, 1, january, if, 45, bc, was, a, leap, year, and, 2, january, if, it, was, not, this, necessitates, fourteen, leap, days, up, to, and, including, ad, 8, if, 45, bc, was, a, leap, year, and, thirteen, if, it, was, not, in, 1999, a, papyrus, was, discovered, which, gives, the, dates, of, astronomical, phenomena, in, 24, bc, in, both, the, egyptian, and, roman, calendars, from, 30, august, 26, bc, julian, egypt, had, two, calendars, the, old, egyptian, in, which, every, year, had, 365, days, and, the, new, alexandrian, in, which, every, fourth, year, had, 366, days, up, to, 28, august, 22, bc, julian, the, date, in, both, calendars, was, the, same, the, dates, in, the, alexandrian, and, julian, calendars, are, in, one, to, one, correspondence, except, for, the, period, from, 29, august, in, the, year, preceding, a, julian, leap, year, to, the, following, 24, february, from, a, comparison, of, the, astronomical, data, with, the, egyptian, and, roman, dates, alexander, jones, concluded, that, the, egyptian, astronomers, as, opposed, to, travellers, from, rome, used, the, correct, julian, calendar, due, to, the, confusion, about, this, period, we, cannot, be, sure, exactly, what, day, e, g, julian, day, number, any, particular, roman, date, refers, to, before, march, of, 8, bc, except, for, those, used, in, egypt, in, 24, bc, which, are, secured, by, astronomy, an, inscription, has, been, discovered, which, orders, a, new, calendar, to, be, used, in, the, province, of, asia, to, replace, the, previous, greek, lunar, calendar, according, to, one, translation, intercalation, shall, commence, on, the, day, after, 14, peritius, as, it, is, currently, constituted, in, the, third, year, following, promulgation, of, the, decree, xanthicus, shall, have, 32, days, in, this, intercalary, year, this, is, historically, correct, it, was, decreed, by, the, proconsul, that, the, first, day, of, the, year, in, the, new, calendar, shall, be, augustus, birthday, a, d, ix, kal, oct, every, month, begins, on, the, ninth, day, before, the, kalends, the, date, of, introduction, the, day, after, 14, peritius, was, 1, dystrus, the, next, month, the, month, after, that, was, xanthicus, thus, xanthicus, began, on, a, d, ix, kal, mart, and, normally, contained, 31, days, in, leap, year, however, it, contained, an, extra, sebaste, day, the, roman, leap, day, and, thus, had, 32, days, from, the, lunar, nature, of, the, old, calendar, we, can, fix, the, starting, date, of, the, new, one, as, 24, january, a, d, ix, kal, feb, 5, bc, in, the, julian, calendar, which, was, a, leap, year, thus, from, inception, the, dates, of, the, reformed, asian, calendar, are, in, one, to, one, correspondence, with, the, julian, another, translation, of, this, inscription, is, intercalation, shall, commence, on, the, day, after, the, fourteenth, day, in, the, current, month, of, peritius, occurring, every, third, year, xanthicus, shall, have, 32, days, in, this, intercalary, year, this, would, move, the, starting, date, back, three, years, to, 8, bc, and, from, the, lunar, synchronism, back, to, 26, january, julian, but, since, the, corresponding, roman, date, in, the, inscription, is, 24, january, this, must, be, according, to, the, incorrect, calendar, which, in, 8, bc, augustus, had, ordered, to, be, corrected, by, the, omission, of, leap, days, as, the, authors, of, the, previous, paper, point, out, with, the, correct, four, year, cycle, being, used, in, egypt, and, the, three, year, cycle, abolished, in, rome, it, is, unlikely, that, augustus, would, have, ordered, the, three, year, cycle, to, be, introduced, in, asia, the, julian, reform, did, not, immediately, cause, the, names, of, any, months, to, be, changed, the, old, intercalary, month, was, abolished, and, replaced, with, a, single,

july, in, 44, bc, and, sextilis, as, augustus, august, in, 8, bc, quintilis, was, renamed, to, honour, caesar, because, it, was, the, month, of, his, birth, according, to, a, senatus, consultum, quoted, by, macrobius, sextilis, was, renamed, to, honour, augustus, because, several, of, the, most, significant, events, in, his, rise, to, power, culminating, in, the, fall, of, alexandria, occurred, in, that, month, other, months, were, renamed, by, other, emperors, but, apparently, none, of, the, later, changes, survived, their, deaths, in, ad, 37, caligula, renamed, september, as, germanicus, after, his, father, in, ad, 65, nero, renamed, april, as, neroneus, may, as, claudius, and, june, as, germanicus, and, in, ad, 84, domitian, renamed, september, as, germanicus, and,

but, the, story, is, doubtful, since, he, did, not, become, emperor, before, november, 275, similar, honorific, month, names, were, implemented, in, many, of, the, provincial, calendars, that, were, aligned, to, the, julian, calendar, other, name, changes, were, proposed, but, were, never, implemented, tiberius, rejected, a, senatorial, proposal, to, rename, september, as, tiberius, and, october, as, livius, after, his, mother, livia, antoninus, pius, rejected, a, senatorial, decree, renaming, september, as, antoninus, and, november, as, faustina, after, his, empress, much, more, lasting, than, the, ephemeral, month, names, of, the, post, augustan, roman, emperors, were, the, old, high, german, names, introduced, by, charlemagne, according, to, his, biographer, einhard, charlemagne, renamed, all, of, the, months, agriculturally, in, german, these, names, were, used, until, the, 15th, century, over, 700, years, after, his, rule, and, continued, with, some, modifications, to, be, used, as, traditional, month, names, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, names, january, to, december, were, wintarmanoth, winter, month, hornung, lentzinmanoth, spring, month, lent, month,

amazigh, berbers, were, derived, from, the, latin, names, however, in, eastern, europe, older, seasonal, month, names, continued, to, be, used, into, the, 19th, century, and, in, some, cases, are, still, in, use, in, many, languages, including, belarusian, bulgarian, croatian, czech, finnish, georgian, lithuanian, macedonian, polish, romanian, slovene, ukrainian, when, the, ottoman, empire, adopted, the, julian, calendar, in, the, form, of, the, rumi, calendar, the, month, names, reflected, ottoman, tradition, the, principal, method, used, by, the, romans, to, identify, a, year, for, dating, purposes, was, to, name, it, after, the, two, consuls, who, took, office, in, it, the, eponymous, period, in, question, being, the, consular, year, beginning, in, 153, bc, consuls, began, to, take, office, on, 1, january, thus, synchronizing, the, commencement, of, the, consular, and, calendar, years, the, calendar, year, has, begun, in, january, and, ended, in, december, since, about, 450, bc, according, to, ovid, or, since, about, 713, bc, according, to, macrobius, and, plutarch, see, roman, calendar, julius, caesar, did, not, change, the, beginning, of, either, the, consular, year, or, the, calendar, year, in, addition, to, consular, years, the, romans, sometimes, used, the, regnal, year, of, the, emperor, and, by, the, late, 4th, century, documents, were, also, being, dated, according, to, the, 15, year, cycle, of, the, indiction, in, 537, justinian, required, that, henceforth, the, date, must, include, the, name, of, the, emperor, and, his, regnal, year, in, addition, to, the, indiction, and, the, consul, while, also, allowing, the, use, of, local, eras, in, 309, and, 310, and, from, time, to, time, thereafter, no, consuls, were, appointed, when, this, happened, the, consular, date, was, given, a, count, of, years, since, the, last, consul, called, post, consular, dating, after, 541, only, the, reigning, emperor, held, the, consulate, typically, for, only, one, year, in, his, reign, and, so, post, consular, dating, became, the, norm, similar, post, consular, dates, were, also, known, in, the, west, in, the, early, 6th, century, the, system, of, consular, dating, long, obsolete, was, formally, abolished, in, the, law, code, of, leo, vi, issued, in, 888, only, rarely, did, the, romans, number, the, year, from, the, founding, of, the, city, of, rome, ab, urbe, condita, auc, this, method, was, used, by, roman, historians, to, determine, the, number, of, years, from, one, event, to, another, not, to, date, a, year, different, historians, had, several, different, dates, for, the, founding, the, fasti, capitolini, an, inscription, containing, an, official, list, of, the, consuls, which, was, published, by, augustus, used, an, epoch, of, 752, bc, the, epoch, used, by, varro, 753, bc, has, been, adopted, by, modern, historians, indeed, renaissance, editors, often, added, it, to, the, manuscripts, that, they, published, giving, the, false, impression, that, the, romans, numbered, their, years, most, modern, historians, tacitly, assume, that, it, began, on, the, day, the, consuls, took, office, and, ancient, documents, such, as, the, fasti, capitolini, which, use, other, auc, systems, do, so, in, the, same, way, however, censorinus, writing, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, states, that, in, his, time, the, auc, year, began, with, the, parilia, celebrated, on, 21, april, which, was, regarded, as, the, actual, anniversary, of, the, foundation, of, rome, many, local, eras, such, as, the, era, of, actium, and, the, spanish, era, were, adopted, for, the, julian, calendar, or, its, local, equivalent, in, the, provinces, and, cities, of, the, roman, empire, some, of, these, were, used, for, a, considerable, time, perhaps, the, best, known, is, the, era, of, martyrs, sometimes, also, called, anno, diocletiani, after, diocletian, which, was, associated, with, the, alexandrian, calendar, and, often, used, by, the, alexandrian, christians, to, number, their, easters, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, and, continues, to, be, used, by, the, coptic, and, ethiopian, churches, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, efforts, of, christian, chronographers, such, as, annianus, of, alexandria, to, date, the, biblical, creation, of, the, world, led, to, the, introduction, of, anno, mundi, eras, based, on, this, event, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, etos, kosmou, used, throughout, the, byzantine, world, from, the, 10th, century, and, in, russia, until, 1700, in, the, west, the, kingdoms, succeeding, the, empire, initially, used, indictions, and, regnal, years, alone, or, in, combination, the, chronicler, prosper, of, aquitaine, in, the, fifth, century, used, an, era, dated, from, the, passion, of, christ, but, this, era, was, not, widely, adopted, dionysius, exiguus, proposed, the, system, of, anno, domini, in, 525, this, era, gradually, spread, through, the, western, christian, world, once, the, system, was, adopted, by, bede, in, the, eighth, century, the, julian, calendar, was, also, used, in, some, muslim, countries, the, rumi, calendar, the, julian, calendar, used, in, the, later, years, of, the, ottoman, empire, adopted, an, era, derived, from, the, lunar, ah, year, equivalent, to, ad, 1840, i, e, the, effective, rumi, epoch, was, ad, 585, in, recent, years, some, users, of, the, berber, calendar, have, adopted, an, era, starting, in, 950, bc, the, approximate, date, that, the, libyan, pharaoh, sheshonq, i, came, to, power, in, egypt, the, roman, calendar, began, the, year, on, 1, january, and, this, remained, the, start, of, the, year, after, the, julian, reform, however, even, after, local, calendars, were, aligned, to, the, julian, calendar, they, started, the, new, year, on, different, dates, the, alexandrian, calendar, in, egypt, started, on, 29, august, 30, august, after, an, alexandrian, leap, year, several, local, provincial, calendars, were, aligned, to, start, on, the, birthday, of, augustus, 23, september, the, indiction, caused, the, byzantine, year, which, used, the, julian, calendar, to, begin, on, 1, september, this, date, is, still, used, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, for, the, beginning, of, the, liturgical, year, when, the, julian, calendar, was, adopted, in, ad, 988, by, vladimir, i, of, kiev, the, year, was, numbered, anno, mundi, 6496, beginning, on, 1, march, six, months, after, the, start, of, the, byzantine, anno, mundi, year, with, the, same, number, in, 1492, am, 7000, ivan, iii, according, to, church, tradition, realigned, the, start, of, the, year, to, 1, september, so, that, am, 7000, only, lasted, for, six, months, in, russia, from, 1, march, to, 31, august, 1492, in, anglo, saxon, england, the, year, most, commonly, began, on, 25, december, which, as, approximately, the, winter, solstice, had, marked, the, start, of, the, year, in, pagan, times, though, 25, march, the, equinox, is, occasionally, documented, in, the, 11th, century, sometimes, the, start, of, the, year, was, reckoned, as, 24, september, the, start, of, the, so, called, western, indiction, introduced, by, bede, these, practices, changed, after, the, norman, conquest, from, 1087, to, 1155, the, english, year, began, on, 1, january, and, from, 1155, to, 1751, it, began, on, 25, march, in, 1752, it, was, moved, back, to, 1, january, see, calendar, act, 1750, even, before, 1752, 1, january, was, sometimes, treated, as, the, start, of, the, new, year, for, example, by, pepys, while, the, year, starting, 25th, march, was, called, the, civil, or, legal, year, to, reduce, misunderstandings, on, the, date, it, was, not, uncommon, for, a, date, between, 1, january, and, 24, march, to, be, written, as, 1661, 62, this, was, to, explain, to, the, reader, that, the, year, was, 1661, counting, from, march, and, 1662, counting, from, january, as, the, start, of, the, year, for, more, detail, see, dual, dating, the, julian,

march, 1917, russia, changed, on, 1, 14, february, 1918, greece, made, the, change, for, civil, purposes, on, 16, february, 1, march, 1923, but, the, national, day, 25, march, was, to, remain, on, the, old, calendar, most, christian, denominations, in, the, west, and, areas, evangelised, by, western, churches, have, made, the, change, to, gregorian, for, their, liturgical, calendars, to, align, with, the, civil, calendar, a, calendar, similar, to, the, julian, one, the, alexandrian, calendar, is, the, basis, for, the, ethiopian, calendar, which, is, still, the, civil, calendar, of, ethiopia,

was, used, in, documents, and, gave, the, date, according, to, both, systems, in, contemporary, as, well, as, modern, texts, that, describe, events, during, the, period, of, change, it, is, customary, to, clarify, to, which, calendar, a, given, date, refers, by, using, an, o, s, or, n, s, suffix, denoting, old, style, julian, or, new, style, gregorian, in, 1582, pope, gregory, xiii, promulgated, the, gregorian, calendar, reform, was, required, as, the, julian, calendar, year, with, an, average, length, of, 365, 25, days, was, longer, than, the, natural, tropical, year, on, average, the, astronomical, solstices, and, the, equinoxes, advance, by, 10, 8, minutes, per, year, against, the, julian, calendar, year, as, a, result, 21, march, which, is, the, base, date, for, calculating, the, date, of, easter, gradually, moved, out, of, alignment, with, the, march, equinox, while, hipparchus, and, presumably, sosigenes, were, aware, of, the, discrepancy, although, not, of, its, correct, value, it, was, evidently, felt, to, be, of, little, importance, at, the, time, of, the, julian, reform, 46, bc, however, it, accumulated, significantly, over, time, the, julian, calendar, gained, a, day, every, 128, years, by, 1582, 21, march, was, ten, days, out, of, alignment, with, the, march, equinox, the, date, where, it, was, reckoned, to, have, been, in, 325, the, year, of, the, council, of, nicaea, since, the, julian, and, gregorian, calendars, were, long, used, simultaneously, although, in, different, places, calendar, dates, in, the, transition, period, are, often, ambiguous, unless, it, is, specified, which, calendar, was, being, used, in, some, circumstances, double, dates, might, be, used, one, in, each, calendar, the, notation, old, style, o, s, is, sometimes, used, to, indicate, a, date, in, the, julian, calendar, as, opposed, to, new, style, n, s, which, either, represents, the, gregorian, date, or, the, julian, date, with, the, start, of, the, year, as, 1, january, this, notation, is, used, to, clarify, dates, from, countries, that, continued, to, use, the, julian, calendar, after, the, gregorian, reform, such, as, great, britain, which, did, not, adopt, the, reformed, calendar, until, 1752, or, russia, which, did, not, do, so, until, 1918, see, soviet, calendar, this, is, why, the, russian, revolution, of, 7, november, 1917, n, s, is, known, as, the, october, revolution, because, it, began, on, 25, october, o, s, although, most, eastern, orthodox, countries, most, of, them, in, eastern, or, southeastern, europe, had, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, by, 1924, their, national, churches, had, not, the, revised, julian, calendar, was, endorsed, by, a, synod, in, constantinople, in, may, 1923, consisting, of, a, solar, part, which, was, and, will, be, identical, to, the, gregorian, calendar, until, the, year, 2800, and, a, lunar, part, which, calculated, easter, astronomically, at, jerusalem, all, eastern, orthodox, churches, refused, to, accept, the, lunar, part, so, all, orthodox, churches, continue, to, celebrate, easter, according, to, the, julian, calendar, with, the, exception, of, the, finnish, orthodox, church, the, estonian, orthodox, church, was, also, an, exception, from, 1923, to, 1945, the, orthodox, churches, of, jerusalem, russia, serbia, montenegro, poland, from, 15, june, 2014, north, macedonia, georgia, and, the, greek, old, calendarists, and, other, groups, continue, to, use, the, julian, calendar, thus, they, celebrate, the, nativity, on, 25, december, julian, which, is, 7, january, gregorian, until, 2100, the, russian, orthodox, church, has, some, parishes, in, the, west, that, celebrate, the, nativity, on, 25, december, gregorian, until, 2799, the, orthodox, church, of, ukraine, announced, in, late, may, 2023, that, they, would, use, the, gregorian, calendar, to, celebrate, christmas, on, december, 25, 2023, partly, in, reflection, to, russia, s, invasion, of, the, country, in, early, 2022, most, branches, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, use, the, julian, calendar, for, calculating, the, date, of, easter, upon, which, the, timing, of, all, the, other,
