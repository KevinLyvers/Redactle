gel, electrophoresis, is, a, method, for, separation, and, analysis, of, biomacromolecules, dna, rna, proteins, etc, and, their, fragments, based, on, their, size, and, charge, it, is, used, in, clinical, chemistry, to, separate, proteins, by, charge, or, size, ief, agarose, essentially, size, independent, and, in, biochemistry, and, molecular, biology, to, separate, a, mixed, population, of, dna, and, rna, fragments, by, length, to, estimate, the, size, of, dna, and, rna, fragments, or, to, separate, proteins, by, charge, nucleic, acid, molecules, are, separated, by, applying, an, electric, field, to, move, the, negatively, charged, molecules, through, a, matrix, of, agarose, or, other, substances, shorter, molecules, move, faster, and, migrate, farther, than, longer, ones, because, shorter, molecules, migrate, more, easily, through, the, pores, of, the, gel, this, phenomenon, is, called, sieving, proteins, are, separated, by, the, charge, in, agarose, because, the, pores, of, the, gel, are, too, large, to, sieve, proteins, gel, electrophoresis, can, also, be, used, for, the, separation, of, nanoparticles, gel, electrophoresis, uses, a, gel, as, an, anticonvective, medium, or, sieving, medium, during, electrophoresis, the, movement, of, a, charged, particle, in, an, electric, current, gels, suppress, the, thermal, convection, caused, by, the, application, of, the, electric, field, and, can, also, act, as, a, sieving, medium, slowing, the, passage, of, molecules, gels, can, also, simply, serve, to, maintain, the, finished, separation, so, that, a, post, electrophoresis, stain, can, be, applied, dna, gel, electrophoresis, is, usually, performed, for, analytical, purposes, often, after, amplification, of, dna, via, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, but, may, be, used, as, a, preparative, technique, prior, to, use, of, other, methods, such, as, mass, spectrometry, rflp, pcr, cloning, dna, sequencing, or, southern, blotting, for, further, characterization, electrophoresis, is, a, process, that, enables, the, sorting, of, molecules, based, on, charge, size, or, shape, using, an, electric, field, molecules, such, as, dna, can, be, made, to, move, through, a, gel, made, of, agarose, or, polyacrylamide, the, electric, field, consists, of, a, negative, charge, at, one, end, which, pushes, the, molecules, through, the, gel, and, a, positive, charge, at, the, other, end, that, pulls, the, molecules, through, the, gel, the, molecules, being, sorted, are, dispensed, into, a, well, in, the, gel, material, the, gel, is, placed, in, an, electrophoresis, chamber, which, is, then, connected, to, a, power, source, when, the, electric, field, is, applied, the, larger, molecules, move, more, slowly, through, the, gel, while, the, smaller, molecules, move, faster, the, different, sized, molecules, form, distinct, bands, on, the, gel, the, term, gel, in, this, instance, refers, to, the, matrix, used, to, contain, then, separate, the, target, molecules, in, most, cases, the, gel, is, a, crosslinked, polymer, whose, composition, and, porosity, are, chosen, based, on, the, specific, weight, and, composition, of, the, target, to, be, analyzed, when, separating, proteins, or, small, nucleic, acids, dna, rna, or, oligonucleotides, the, gel, is, usually, composed, of, different, concentrations, of, acrylamide, and, a, cross, linker, producing, different, sized, mesh, networks, of, polyacrylamide, when, separating, larger, nucleic, acids, greater, than, a, few, hundred, bases, the, preferred, matrix, is, purified, agarose, in, both, cases, the, gel, forms, a, solid, yet, porous, matrix, acrylamide, in, contrast, to, polyacrylamide, is, a, neurotoxin, and, must, be, handled, using, appropriate, safety, precautions, to, avoid, poisoning, agarose, is, composed, of, long, unbranched, chains, of, uncharged, carbohydrates, without, cross, links, resulting, in, a, gel, with, large, pores, allowing, for, the, separation, of, macromolecules, and, macromolecular, complexes, electrophoresis, refers, to, the, electromotive, force, emf, that, is, used, to, move, the, molecules, through, the, gel, matrix, by, placing, the, molecules, in, wells, in, the, gel, and, applying, an, electric, field, the, molecules, will, move, through, the, matrix, at, different, rates, determined, largely, by, their, mass, when, the, charge, to, mass, ratio, z, of, all, species, is, uniform, however, when, charges, are, not, all, uniform, the, electrical, field, generated, by, the, electrophoresis, procedure, will, cause, the, molecules, to, migrate, differentially, according, to, charge, species, that, are, net, positively, charged, will, migrate, towards, the, cathode, which, is, negatively, charged, because, this, is, an, electrolytic, rather, than, galvanic, cell, whereas, species, that, are, net, negatively, charged, will, migrate, towards, the, positively, charged, anode, mass, remains, a, factor, in, the, speed, with, which, these, non, uniformly, charged, molecules, migrate, through, the, matrix, toward, their, respective, electrodes, if, several, samples, have, been, loaded, into, adjacent, wells, in, the, gel, they, will, run, parallel, in, individual, lanes, depending, on, the, number, of, different, molecules, each, lane, shows, the, separation, of, the, components, from, the, original, mixture, as, one, or, more, distinct, bands, one, band, per, component, incomplete, separation, of, the, components, can, lead, to, overlapping, bands, or, indistinguishable, smears, representing, multiple, unresolved, components, bands, in, different, lanes, that, end, up, at, the, same, distance, from, the, top, contain, molecules, that, passed, through, the, gel, at, the, same, speed, which, usually, means, they, are, approximately, the, same, size, there, are, molecular, weight, size, markers, available, that, contain, a, mixture, of, molecules, of, known, sizes, if, such, a, marker, was, run, on, one, lane, in, the, gel, parallel, to, the, unknown, samples, the, bands, observed, can, be, compared, to, those, of, the, unknown, to, determine, their, size, the, distance, a, band, travels, is, approximately, inversely, proportional, to, the, logarithm, of, the, size, of, the, molecule, alternatively, this, can, be, stated, as, the, distance, traveled, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, log, of, samples, s, molecular, weight, there, are, limits, to, electrophoretic, techniques, since, passing, a, current, through, a, gel, causes, heating, gels, may, melt, during, electrophoresis, electrophoresis, is, performed, in, buffer, solutions, to, reduce, ph, changes, due, to, the, electric, field, which, is, important, because, the, charge, of, dna, and, rna, depends, on, ph, but, running, for, too, long, can, exhaust, the, buffering, capacity, of, the, solution, there, are, also, limitations, in, determining, the, molecular, weight, by, sds, page, especially, when, trying, to, find, the, mw, of, an, unknown, protein, certain, biological, variables, are, difficult, or, impossible, to, minimize, and, can, affect, electrophoretic, migration, such, factors, include, protein, structure, post, translational, modifications, and, amino, acid, composition, for, example, tropomyosin, is, an, acidic, protein, that, migrates, abnormally, on, sds, page, gels, this, is, because, the, acidic, residues, are, repelled, by, the, negatively, charged, sds, leading, to, an, inaccurate, mass, to, charge, ratio, and, migration, further, different, preparations, of, genetic, material, may, not, migrate, consistently, with, each, other, for, morphological, or, other, reasons, the, types, of, gel, most, typically, used, are, agarose, and, polyacrylamide, gels, each, type, of, gel, is, well, suited, to, different, types, and, sizes, of, the, analyte, polyacrylamide, gels, are, usually, used, for, proteins, and, have, very, high, resolving, power, for, small, fragments, of, dna, 5, 500, bp, agarose, gels, on, the, other, hand, have, lower, resolving, power, for, dna, but, have, a, greater, range, of, separation, and, are, therefore, used, for, dna, fragments, of, usually, 50, 20, 000, bp, in, size, but, the, resolution, of, over, 6, mb, is, possible, with, pulsed, field, gel, electrophoresis, pfge, polyacrylamide, gels, are, run, in, a, vertical, configuration, while, agarose, gels, are, typically, run, horizontally, in, a, submarine, mode, they, also, differ, in, their, casting, methodology, as, agarose, sets, thermally, while, polyacrylamide, forms, in, a, chemical, polymerization, reaction, agarose, gels, are, made, from, the, natural, polysaccharide, polymers, extracted, from, seaweed, agarose, gels, are, easily, cast, and, handled, compared, to, other, matrices, because, the, gel, setting, is, a, physical, rather, than, chemical, change, samples, are, also, easily, recovered, after, the, experiment, is, finished, the, resulting, gel, can, be, stored, in, a, plastic, bag, in, a, refrigerator, agarose, gels, do, not, have, a, uniform, pore, size, but, are, optimal, for, electrophoresis, of, proteins, that, are, larger, than, 200, kda, agarose, gel, electrophoresis, can, also, be, used, for, the, separation, of, dna, fragments, ranging, from, 50, base, pair, to, several, megabases, millions, of, bases, the, largest, of, which, require, specialized, apparatus, the, distance, between, dna, bands, of, different, lengths, is, influenced, by, the, percent, agarose, in, the, gel, with, higher, percentages, requiring, longer, run, times, sometimes, days, instead, high, percentage, agarose, gels, should, be, run, with, a, pulsed, field, electrophoresis, pfe, or, field, inversion, electrophoresis, most, agarose, gels, are, made, with, between, 0, 7, good, separation, or, resolution, of, large, 5, 10kb, dna, fragments, and, 2, good, resolution, for, small, 0, 2, 1kb, fragments, agarose, dissolved, in, electrophoresis, buffer, up, to, 3, can, be, used, for, separating, very, tiny, fragments, but, a, vertical, polyacrylamide, gel, is, more, appropriate, in, this, case, low, percentage, gels, are, very, weak, and, may, break, when, you, try, to, lift, them, high, percentage, gels, are, often, brittle, and, do, not, set, evenly, 1, gels, are, common, for, many, applications, polyacrylamide, gel, electrophoresis, page, is, used, for, separating, proteins, ranging, in, size, from, 5, to, 2, 000, kda, due, to, the, uniform, pore, size, provided, by, the, polyacrylamide, gel, pore, size, is, controlled, by, modulating, the, concentrations, of, acrylamide, and, bis, acrylamide, powder, used, in, creating, a, gel, care, must, be, used, when, creating, this, type, of, gel, as, acrylamide, is, a, potent, neurotoxin, in, its, liquid, and, powdered, forms, traditional, dna, sequencing, techniques, such, as, maxam, gilbert, or, sanger, methods, used, polyacrylamide, gels, to, separate, dna, fragments, differing, by, a, single, base, pair, in, length, so, the, sequence, could, be, read, most, modern, dna, separation, methods, now, use, agarose, gels, except, for, particularly, small, dna, fragments, it, is, currently, most, often, used, in, the, field, of, immunology, and, protein, analysis, often, used, to, separate, different, proteins, or, isoforms, of, the, same, protein, into, separate, bands, these, can, be, transferred, onto, a, nitrocellulose, or, pvdf, membrane, to, be, probed, with, antibodies, and, corresponding, markers, such, as, in, a, western, blot, typically, resolving, gels, are, made, in, 6, 8, 10, 12, or, 15, stacking, gel, 5, is, poured, on, top, of, the, resolving, gel, and, a, gel, comb, which, forms, the, wells, and, defines, the, lanes, where, proteins, sample, buffer, and, ladders, will, be, placed, is, inserted, the, percentage, chosen, depends, on, the, size, of, the, protein, that, one, wishes, to, identify, or, probe, in, the, sample, the, smaller, the, known, weight, the, higher, the, percentage, that, should, be, used, changes, in, the, buffer, system, of, the, gel, can, help, to, further, resolve, proteins, of, very, small, sizes, partially, hydrolysed, potato, starch, makes, for, another, non, toxic, medium, for, protein, electrophoresis, the, gels, are, slightly, more, opaque, than, acrylamide, or, agarose, non, denatured, proteins, can, be, separated, according, to, charge, and, size, they, are, visualised, using, napthal, black, or, amido, black, staining, typical, starch, gel, concentrations, are, 5, to, 10, denaturing, gels, are, run, under, conditions, that, disrupt, the, natural, structure, of, the, analyte, causing, it, to, unfold, into, a, linear, chain, thus, the, mobility, of, each, macromolecule, depends, only, on, its, linear, length, and, its, mass, to, charge, ratio, thus, the, secondary, tertiary, and, quaternary, levels, of, biomolecular, structure, are, disrupted, leaving, only, the, primary, structure, to, be, analyzed, nucleic, acids, are, often, denatured, by, including, urea, in, the, buffer, while, proteins, are, denatured, using, sodium, dodecyl, sulfate, usually, as, part, of, the, sds, page, process, for, full, denaturation, of, proteins, it, is, also, necessary, to, reduce, the, covalent, disulfide, bonds, that, stabilize, their, tertiary, and, quaternary, structure, a, method, called, reducing, page, reducing, conditions, are, usually, maintained, by, the, addition, of, beta, mercaptoethanol, or, dithiothreitol, for, a, general, analysis, of, protein, samples, reducing, page, is, the, most, common, form, of, protein, electrophoresis, denaturing, conditions, are, necessary, for, proper, estimation, of, molecular, weight, of, rna, rna, is, able, to, form, more, intramolecular, interactions, than, dna, which, may, result, in, change, of, its, electrophoretic, mobility, urea, dmso, and, glyoxal, are, the, most, often, used, denaturing, agents, to, disrupt, rna, structure, originally, highly, toxic, methylmercury, hydroxide, was, often, used, in, denaturing, rna, electrophoresis, but, it, may, be, method, of, choice, for, some, samples, denaturing, gel, electrophoresis, is, used, in, the, dna, and, rna, banding, pattern, based, methods, temperature, gradient, gel, electrophoresis, tgge, and, denaturing, gradient, gel, electrophoresis, dgge, native, gels, are, run, in, non, denaturing, conditions, so, that, the, analyte, s, natural, structure, is, maintained, this, allows, the, physical, size, of, the, folded, or, assembled, complex, to, affect, the, mobility, allowing, for, analysis, of, all, four, levels, of, the, biomolecular, structure, for, biological, samples, detergents, are, used, only, to, the, extent, that, they, are, necessary, to, lyse, lipid, membranes, in, the, cell, complexes, remain, for, the, most, part, associated, and, folded, as, they, would, be, in, the, cell, one, downside, however, is, that, complexes, may, not, separate, cleanly, or, predictably, as, it, is, difficult, to, predict, how, the, molecule, s, shape, and, size, will, affect, its, mobility, addressing, and, solving, this, problem, is, a, major, aim, of, preparative, native, page, unlike, denaturing, methods, native, gel, electrophoresis, does, not, use, a, charged, denaturing, agent, the, molecules, being, separated, usually, proteins, or, nucleic, acids, therefore, differ, not, only, in, molecular, mass, and, intrinsic, charge, but, also, the, cross, sectional, area, and, thus, experience, different, electrophoretic, forces, dependent, on, the, shape, of, the, overall, structure, for, proteins, since, they, remain, in, the, native, state, they, may, be, visualized, not, only, by, general, protein, staining, reagents, but, also, by, specific, enzyme, linked, staining, a, specific, experiment, example, of, an, application, of, native, gel, electrophoresis, is, to, check, for, enzymatic, activity, to, verify, the, presence, of, the, enzyme, in, the, sample, during, protein, purification, for, example, for, the, protein, alkaline, phosphatase, the, staining, solution, is, a, mixture, of, 4, chloro, 2, 2methylbenzenediazonium, salt, with, 3, phospho, 2, naphthoic, acid, 2, 4, dimethyl, aniline, in, tris, buffer, this, stain, is, commercially, sold, as, a, kit, for, staining, gels, if, the, protein, is, present, the, mechanism, of, the, reaction, takes, place, in, the, following, order, it, starts, with, the, de, phosphorylation, of, 3, phospho, 2, naphthoic, acid, 2, 4, dimethyl, aniline, by, alkaline, phosphatase, water, is, needed, for, the, reaction, the, phosphate, group, is, released, and, replaced, by, an, alcohol, group, from, water, the, electrophile, 4, chloro, 2, 2, methylbenzenediazonium, fast, red, tr, diazonium, salt, displaces, the, alcohol, group, forming, the, final, product, red, azo, dye, as, its, name, implies, this, is, the, final, visible, red, product, of, the, reaction, in, undergraduate, academic, experimentation, of, protein, purification, the, gel, is, usually, run, next, to, commercial, purified, samples, to, visualize, the, results, and, conclude, whether, or, not, purification, was, successful, native, gel, electrophoresis, is, typically, used, in, proteomics, and, metallomics, however, native, page, is, also, used, to, scan, genes, dna, for, unknown, mutations, as, in, single, strand, conformation, polymorphism, buffers, in, gel, electrophoresis, are, used, to, provide, ions, that, carry, a, current, and, to, maintain, the, ph, at, a, relatively, constant, value, these, buffers, have, plenty, of, ions, in, them, which, is, necessary, for, the, passage, of, electricity, through, them, something, like, distilled, water, or, benzene, contains, few, ions, which, is, not, ideal, for, the, use, in, electrophoresis, there, are, a, number, of, buffers, used, for, electrophoresis, the, most, common, being, for, nucleic, acids, tris, acetate, edta, tae, tris, borate, edta, tbe, many, other, buffers, have, been, proposed, e, g, lithium, borate, which, is, rarely, used, based, on, pubmed, citations, lb, isoelectric, histidine, pk, matched, goods, buffers, etc, in, most, cases, the, purported, rationale, is, lower, current, less, heat, matched, ion, mobilities, which, leads, to, longer, buffer, life, borate, is, problematic, borate, can, polymerize, or, interact, with, cis, diols, such, as, those, found, in, rna, tae, has, the, lowest, buffering, capacity, but, provides, the, best, resolution, for, larger, dna, this, means, a, lower, voltage, and, more, time, but, a, better, product, lb, is, relatively, new, and, is, ineffective, in, resolving, fragments, larger, than, 5, kbp, however, with, its, low, conductivity, a, much, higher, voltage, could, be, used, up, to, 35, v, cm, which, means, a, shorter, analysis, time, for, routine, electrophoresis, as, low, as, one, base, pair, size, difference, could, be, resolved, in, 3, agarose, gel, with, an, extremely, low, conductivity, medium, 1, mm, lithium, borate, most, sds, page, protein, separations, are, performed, using, a, discontinuous, or, disc, buffer, system, that, significantly, enhances, the, sharpness, of, the, bands, within, the, gel, during, electrophoresis, in, a, discontinuous, gel, system, an, ion, gradient, is, formed, in, the, early, stage, of, electrophoresis, that, causes, all, of, the, proteins, to, focus, on, a, single, sharp, band, in, a, process, called, isotachophoresis, separation, of, the, proteins, by, size, is, achieved, in, the, lower, resolving, region, of, the, gel, the, resolving, gel, typically, has, a, much, smaller, pore, size, which, leads, to, a, sieving, effect, that, now, determines, the, electrophoretic, mobility, of, the, proteins, after, the, electrophoresis, is, complete, the, molecules, in, the, gel, can, be, stained, to, make, them, visible, dna, may, be, visualized, using, ethidium, bromide, which, when, intercalated, into, dna, fluoresce, under, ultraviolet, light, while, protein, may, be, visualised, using, silver, stain, or, coomassie, brilliant, blue, dye, other, methods, may, also, be, used, to, visualize, the, separation, of, the, mixture, s, components, on, the, gel, if, the, molecules, to, be, separated, contain, radioactivity, for, example, in, a, dna, sequencing, gel, an, autoradiogram, can, be, recorded, of, the, gel, photographs, can, be, taken, of, gels, often, using, a, gel, doc, system, gels, are, then, commonly, labelled, for, presentation, and, scientific, records, on, the, popular, figure, creation, website, sciugo, after, separation, an, additional, separation, method, may, then, be, used, such, as, isoelectric, focusing, or, sds, page, the, gel, will, then, be, physically, cut, and, the, protein, complexes, extracted, from, each, portion, separately, each, extract, may, then, be, analysed, such, as, by, peptide, mass, fingerprinting, or, de, novo, peptide, sequencing, after, in, gel, digestion, this, can, provide, a, great, deal, of, information, about, the, identities, of, the, proteins, in, a, complex, gel, electrophoresis, is, used, in, forensics, molecular, biology, genetics, microbiology, and, biochemistry, the, results, can, be, analyzed, quantitatively, by, visualizing, the, gel, with, uv, light, and, a, gel, imaging, device, the, image, is, recorded, with, a, computer, operated, camera, and, the, intensity, of, the, band, or, spot, of, interest, is, measured, and, compared, against, standard, or, markers, loaded, on, the, same, gel, the, measurement, and, analysis, are, mostly, done, with, specialized, software, depending, on, the, type, of, analysis, being, performed, other, techniques, are, often, implemented, in, conjunction, with, the, results, of, gel, electrophoresis, providing, a, wide, range, of, field, specific, applications, in, the, case, of, nucleic, acids, the, direction, of, migration, from, negative, to, positive, electrodes, is, due, to, the, naturally, occurring, negative, charge, carried, by, their, sugar, phosphate, backbone, double, stranded, dna, fragments, naturally, behave, as, long, rods, so, their, migration, through, the, gel, is, relative, to, their, size, or, for, cyclic, fragments, their, radius, of, gyration, circular, dna, such, as, plasmids, however, may, show, multiple, bands, the, speed, of, migration, may, depend, on, whether, it, is, relaxed, or, supercoiled, single, stranded, dna, or, rna, tends, to, fold, up, into, molecules, with, complex, shapes, and, migrate, through, the, gel, in, a, complicated, manner, based, on, their, tertiary, structure, therefore, agents, that, disrupt, the, hydrogen, bonds, such, as, sodium, hydroxide, or, formamide, are, used, to, denature, the, nucleic, acids, and, cause, them, to, behave, as, long, rods, again, gel, electrophoresis, of, large, dna, or, rna, is, usually, done, by, agarose, gel, electrophoresis, see, the, chain, termination, method, page, for, an, example, of, a, polyacrylamide, dna, sequencing, gel, characterization, through, ligand, interaction, of, nucleic, acids, or, fragments, may, be, performed, by, mobility, shift, affinity, electrophoresis, electrophoresis, of, rna, samples, can, be, used, to, check, for, genomic, dna, contamination, and, also, for, rna, degradation, rna, from, eukaryotic, organisms, shows, distinct, bands, of, 28s, and, 18s, rrna, the, 28s, band, being, approximately, twice, as, intense, as, the, 18s, band, degraded, rna, has, less, sharply, defined, bands, has, a, smeared, appearance, and, the, intensity, ratio, is, less, than, 2, 1, proteins, unlike, nucleic, acids, can, have, varying, charges, and, complex, shapes, therefore, they, may, not, migrate, into, the, polyacrylamide, gel, at, similar, rates, or, all, when, placing, a, negative, to, positive, emf, on, the, sample, proteins, therefore, are, usually, denatured, in, the, presence, of, a, detergent, such, as, sodium, dodecyl, sulfate, sds, that, coats, the, proteins, with, a, negative, charge, generally, the, amount, of, sds, bound, is, relative, to, the, size, of, the, protein, usually, 1, 4g, sds, per, gram, of, protein, so, that, the, resulting, denatured, proteins, have, an, overall, negative, charge, and, all, the, proteins, have, a, similar, charge, to, mass, ratio, since, denatured, proteins, act, like, long, rods, instead, of, having, a, complex, tertiary, shape, the, rate, at, which, the, resulting, sds, coated, proteins, migrate, in, the, gel, is, relative, only, to, their, size, and, not, their, charge, or, shape, proteins, are, usually, analyzed, by, sodium, dodecyl, sulfate, polyacrylamide, gel, electrophoresis, sds, page, by, native, gel, electrophoresis, by, preparative, native, gel, electrophoresis, qpnc, page, or, by, 2, d, electrophoresis, characterization, through, ligand, interaction, may, be, performed, by, electroblotting, or, by, affinity, electrophoresis, in, agarose, or, by, capillary, electrophoresis, as, for, estimation, of, binding, constants, and, determination, of, structural, features, like, glycan, content, through, lectin, binding, a, novel, application, for, gel, electrophoresis, is, the, separation, or, characterization, of, metal, or, metal, oxide, nanoparticles, e, g, au, ag, zno, sio2, regarding, the, size, shape, or, surface, chemistry, of, the, nanoparticles, the, scope, is, to, obtain, a, more, homogeneous, sample, e, g, narrower, particle, size, distribution, which, then, can, be, used, in, further, products, processes, e, g, self, assembly, processes, for, the, separation, of, nanoparticles, within, a, gel, the, key, parameter, is, the, ratio, of, the, particle, size, to, the, mesh, size, whereby, two, migration, mechanisms, were, identified, the, unrestricted, mechanism, where, the, particle, size, mesh, size, and, the, restricted, mechanism, where, particle, size, is, similar, to, mesh, size, a, 1959, book, on, electrophoresis, by, milan, bier, cites, references, from, the, 1800s, however, oliver, smithies, made, significant, contributions, bier, states, the, method, of, smithies, is, finding, wide, application, because, of, its, unique, separatory, power, taken, in, context, bier, clearly, implies, that, smithies, method, is, an, improvement
