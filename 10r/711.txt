a, glider, is, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, that, is, supported, in, flight, by, the, dynamic, reaction, of, the, air, against, its, lifting, surfaces, and, whose, free, flight, does, not, depend, on, an, engine, most, gliders, do, not, have, an, engine, although, motor, gliders, have, small, engines, for, extending, their, flight, when, necessary, by, sustaining, the, altitude, normally, a, sailplane, relies, on, rising, air, to, maintain, altitude, with, some, being, powerful, enough, to, take, off, by, self, launch, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, types, differing, in, the, construction, of, their, wings, aerodynamic, efficiency, location, of, the, pilot, controls, and, intended, purpose, most, exploit, meteorological, phenomena, to, maintain, or, gain, height, gliders, are, principally, used, for, the, air, sports, of, gliding, hang, gliding, and, paragliding, however, some, spacecraft, have, been, designed, to, descend, as, gliders, and, in, the, past, military, gliders, have, been, used, in, warfare, some, simple, and, familiar, types, of, glider, are, toys, such, as, paper, planes, and, balsa, wood, gliders, glider, is, the, agent, noun, form, of, the, verb, to, glide, it, derives, from, middle, english, gliden, which, in, turn, derived, from, old, english, gl, dan, the, oldest, meaning, of, glide, may, have, denoted, a, precipitous, running, or, jumping, as, opposed, to, a, smooth, motion, scholars, are, uncertain, as, to, its, original, derivation, with, possible, connections, to, slide, and, light, having, been, advanced, early, pre, modern, accounts, of, flight, are, in, most, cases, difficult, to, verify, and, it, is, unclear, whether, each, craft, was, a, glider, kite, or, parachute, and, to, what, degree, they, were, truly, controllable, often, the, event, is, only, recorded, a, long, time, after, it, allegedly, took, place, a, 17th, century, account, reports, an, attempt, at, flight, by, the, 9th, century, poet, abbas, ibn, firnas, near, c, rdoba, spain, which, ended, in, heavy, back, injuries, the, monk, eilmer, of, malmesbury, is, reported, by, william, of, malmesbury, c, 1080, c, 1143, a, fellow, monk, and, historian, to, have, flown, off, the, roof, of, his, abbey, in, malmesbury, england, sometime, between, 1000, and, 1010, ad, gliding, about, 200, metres, 220, yd, before, crashing, and, breaking, his, legs, according, to, these, reports, both, used, a, set, of, feathery, wings, and, both, blamed, their, crash, on, the, lack, of, a, tail, hez, rfen, ahmed, elebi, is, alleged, to, have, flown, a, glider, with, eagle, like, wings, over, the, bosphorus, strait, from, the, galata, tower, to, sk, dar, district, in, istanbul, around, 1630, 1632, the, first, heavier, than, air, i, e, non, balloon, man, carrying, aircraft, that, were, based, on, published, scientific, principles, were, sir, george, cayley, s, series, of, gliders, which, achieved, brief, wing, borne, hops, from, around, 1849, thereafter, gliders, were, built, by, pioneers, such, as, jean, marie, le, bris, john, j, montgomery, otto, lilienthal, percy, pilcher, octave, chanute, and, augustus, moore, herring, to, develop, aviation, lilienthal, was, the, first, to, make, repeated, successful, flights, eventually, totaling, over, 2, 000, and, was, the, first, to, use, rising, air, to, prolong, his, flight, using, a, montgomery, tandem, wing, glider, daniel, maloney, was, the, first, to, demonstrate, high, altitude, controlled, flight, using, a, balloon, launched, glider, launched, from, 4, 000, feet, in, 1905, the, wright, brothers, developed, a, series, of, three, manned, gliders, after, preliminary, tests, with, a, kite, as, they, worked, towards, achieving, powered, flight, they, returned, to, glider, testing, in, 1911, by, removing, the, motor, from, one, of, their, later, designs, in, the, inter, war, years, recreational, gliding, flourished, in, germany, under, the, auspices, of, rh, n, rossitten, in, the, united, states, the, schweizer, brothers, of, elmira, new, york, manufactured, sport, sailplanes, to, meet, the, new, demand, sailplanes, continued, to, evolve, in, the, 1930s, and, sport, gliding, has, become, the, main, application, of, gliders, as, their, performance, improved, gliders, began, to, be, used, to, fly, cross, country, and, now, regularly, fly, hundreds, or, even, over, a, thousand, of, kilometers, in, a, day, if, the, weather, is, suitable, military, gliders, were, developed, during, world, war, ii, by, a, number, of, countries, for, landing, troops, a, glider, the, colditz, cock, was, even, built, secretly, by, pows, as, a, potential, escape, method, at, oflag, iv, c, near, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1944, foot, launched, aircraft, had, been, flown, by, lilienthal, and, at, the, meetings, at, wasserkuppe, in, the, 1920s, however, the, innovation, that, led, to, modern, hang, gliders, was, in, 1951, when, francis, rogallo, and, gertrude, rogallo, applied, for, a, patent, for, a, fully, flexible, wing, with, a, stiffening, structure, the, american, space, agency, nasa, began, testing, in, various, flexible, and, semi, rigid, configurations, of, this, rogallo, wing, in, 1957, in, order, to, use, it, as, a, recovery, system, for, the, gemini, space, capsules, charles, richards, and, paul, bikle, developed, the, concept, producing, a, wing, that, was, simple, to, build, which, was, capable, of, slow, flight, and, as, gentle, landing, between, 1960, and, 1962, barry, hill, palmer, used, this, concept, to, make, foot, launched, hang, gliders, followed, in, 1963, by, mike, burns, who, built, a, kite, hang, glider, called, skiplane, in, 1963, john, w, dickenson, began, commercial, production, january, 10, 1963, american, domina, jalbert, filed, a, patent, us, patent, 3131894, on, the, parafoil, which, had, sectioned, cells, in, an, aerofoil, shape, an, open, leading, edge, and, a, closed, trailing, edge, inflated, by, passage, through, the, air, the, ram, air, design, the, sail, wing, was, developed, further, for, recovery, of, nasa, space, capsules, by, david, barish, testing, was, done, by, using, ridge, lift, after, tests, on, hunter, mountain, new, york, in, september, 1965, he, went, on, to, promote, slope, soaring, as, a, summer, activity, for, ski, resorts, apparently, without, great, success, nasa, originated, the, term, paraglider, in, the, early, 1960s, and, paragliding, was, first, used, in, the, early, 1970s, to, describe, foot, launching, of, gliding, parachutes, although, their, use, is, mainly, recreational, unmanned, paragliders, have, also, been, built, for, military, applications, e, g, atair, insect, the, main, application, today, of, glider, aircraft, is, sport, and, recreation, gliders, were, developed, from, the, 1920s, for, recreational, purposes, as, pilots, began, to, understand, how, to, use, rising, air, gliders, were, developed, with, a, high, lift, to, drag, ratio, these, allowed, longer, glides, to, the, next, source, of, lift, and, so, increase, their, chances, of, flying, long, distances, this, gave, rise, to, the, popular, sport, known, as, gliding, although, the, term, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, merely, descending, flight, such, gliders, designed, for, soaring, are, sometimes, called, sailplanes, gliders, were, mainly, built, of, wood, and, metal, but, the, majority, now, have, composite, materials, using, glass, carbon, fibre, and, aramid, fibers, to, minimise, drag, these, types, have, a, fuselage, and, long, narrow, wings, i, e, a, high, aspect, ratio, in, the, beginning, there, were, huge, differences, in, the, appearance, of, early, sailplanes, as, technology, and, materials, developed, the, aspiration, for, the, perfect, balance, between, lift, drag, climbing, ratio, and, gliding, speed, made, engineers, from, various, producers, create, similar, designs, across, the, world, both, single, seat, and, two, seat, gliders, are, available, initially, training, was, done, by, short, hops, in, primary, gliders, which, are, very, basic, aircraft, with, no, cockpit, and, minimal, instruments, since, shortly, after, world, war, ii, training, has, always, been, done, in, two, seat, dual, control, gliders, but, high, performance, two, seaters, are, also, used, to, share, the, workload, and, the, enjoyment, of, long, flights, originally, skids, were, used, for, landing, but, the, majority, now, land, on, wheels, often, retractable, some, gliders, known, as, motor, gliders, are, designed, for, unpowered, flight, but, can, deploy, piston, rotary, jet, or, electric, engines, gliders, are, classified, by, the, fai, for, competitions, into, glider, competition, classes, mainly, on, the, basis, of, span, and, flaps, a, class, of, ultralight, sailplanes, including, some, known, as, microlift, gliders, and, some, as, airchairs, has, been, defined, by, the, fai, based, on, a, maximum, weight, they, are, light, enough, to, be, transported, easily, and, can, be, flown, without, licensing, in, some, countries, ultralight, gliders, have, performance, similar, to, hang, gliders, but, offer, some, additional, crash, safety, as, the, pilot, can, be, strapped, in, an, upright, seat, within, a, deformable, structure, landing, is, usually, on, one, or, two, wheels, which, distinguishes, these, craft, from, hang, gliders, several, commercial, ultralight, gliders, have, come, and, gone, but, most, current, development, is, done, by, individual, designers, and, home, builders, unlike, a, sailplane, a, hang, glider, is, capable, of, being, carried, foot, launched, and, landed, solely, by, the, use, of, the, pilot, s, legs, in, a, hang, glider, the, shape, of, the, wing, is, determined, by, a, structure, and, it, is, this, that, distinguishes, them, from, the, other, main, type, of, foot, launched, aircraft, paragliders, technically, class, 3, some, hang, gliders, have, engines, and, are, known, as, powered, hang, gliders, due, to, their, commonality, of, parts, construction, and, design, they, are, usually, considered, by, aviation, authorities, to, be, hang, gliders, even, though, they, may, use, the, engine, for, the, entire, flight, some, flexible, wing, powered, aircraft, ultralight, trikes, have, a, wheeled, undercarriage, and, so, are, not, hang, gliders, a, paraglider, is, a, free, flying, foot, launched, aircraft, the, pilot, sits, in, a, harness, suspended, below, a, fabric, wing, unlike, a, hang, glider, whose, wings, have, frames, the, form, of, a, paraglider, wing, is, formed, by, the, pressure, of, air, entering, vents, or, cells, in, the, front, of, the, wing, this, is, known, as, a, ram, air, wing, similar, to, the, smaller, parachute, design, the, paraglider, s, light, and, simple, design, allows, them, to, be, packed, and, carried, in, large, backpacks, and, make, them, one, of, the, simplest, and, economical, modes, of, flight, competition, level, wings, can, achieve, glide, ratios, up, to, 1, 10, and, fly, around, speeds, of, 45, km, h, 28, mph, like, sailplanes, and, hang, gliders, paragliders, use, rising, air, thermals, or, ridge, lift, to, gain, height, this, process, is, the, basis, for, most, recreational, flights, and, competitions, though, aerobatics, and, spot, landing, competitions, also, occur, launching, is, often, done, by, jogging, down, a, slope, but, winch, launches, behind, a, towing, vehicle, are, also, used, a, paramotor, is, a, paraglider, wing, powered, by, a, motor, attached, to, the, back, of, the, pilot, and, is, also, known, as, a, powered, paraglider, a, variation, of, this, is, the, paraplane, which, has, a, motor, mounted, on, a, wheeled, frame, rather, than, the, pilot, s, back, there, can, be, confusion, between, gliders, hang, gliders, and, paragliders, paragliders, and, hang, gliders, are, both, foot, launched, glider, aircraft, and, in, both, cases, the, pilot, is, suspended, hangs, below, the, lift, surface, hang, glider, is, the, term, for, those, where, the, airframe, contains, rigid, structures, whereas, the, primary, structure, of, paragliders, is, supple, consisting, mainly, of, woven, material, military, gliders, were, used, mainly, during, the, second, world, war, for, carrying, troops, and, heavy, equipment, see, glider, infantry, to, a, combat, zone, these, aircraft, were, towed, into, the, air, and, most, of, the, way, to, their, target, by, military, transport, planes, e, g, c, 47, dakota, or, by, bombers, that, had, been, relegated, to, secondary, activities, e, g, short, stirling, once, released, from, the, tow, near, the, target, they, landed, as, close, to, the, target, as, possible, advantages, over, paratroopers, were, that, heavy, equipment, could, be, landed, and, that, the, troops, were, quickly, assembled, rather, than, being, dispersed, over, a, drop, zone, the, gliders, were, treated, as, disposable, leading, to, construction, from, common, and, inexpensive, materials, such, as, wood, though, a, few, were, retrieved, and, re, used, by, the, time, of, the, korean, war, transport, aircraft, had, also, become, larger, and, more, efficient, so, that, even, light, tanks, could, be, dropped, by, parachute, causing, gliders, to, fall, out, of, favor, even, after, the, development, of, powered, aircraft, gliders, have, been, built, for, research, where, the, lack, of, powerplant, reduces, complexity, and, construction, costs, and, speeds, development, particularly, where, new, and, poorly, understood, aerodynamic, ideas, are, being, tested, that, might, require, significant, airframe, changes, examples, have, included, delta, wings, flying, wings, lifting, bodies, and, other, unconventional, lifting, surfaces, where, existing, theories, were, not, sufficiently, developed, to, estimate, full, scale, characteristics, unpowered, flying, wings, built, for, aerodynamic, research, include, the, horten, flying, wings, the, scaled, glider, version, of, the, armstrong, whitworth, a, w, 52, jet, powered, flying, wing, lifting, bodies, were, also, developed, using, unpowered, prototypes, although, the, idea, can, be, dated, to, vincent, justus, burnelli, in, 1921, interest, was, nearly, non, existent, until, it, appeared, to, be, a, solution, for, returning, spacecraft, traditional, space, capsules, have, little, directional, control, while, conventionally, winged, craft, cannot, handle, the, stresses, of, re, entry, whereas, a, lifting, body, combines, the, benefits, of, both, the, lifting, bodies, use, the, fuselage, itself, to, generate, lift, without, employing, the, usual, thin, and, flat, wing, so, as, to, minimize, the, drag, and, structure, of, a, wing, for, very, high, supersonic, or, hypersonic, flight, as, might, be, experienced, during, the, re, entry, of, a, spacecraft, examples, of, type, are, the, northrop, hl, 10, and, martin, marietta, x, 24, the, nasa, paresev, rogallo, flexible, wing, glider, was, built, to, investigate, alternative, methods, of, recovering, spacecraft, although, this, application, was, abandoned, publicity, inspired, hobbyists, to, adapt, the, flexible, wing, airfoil, for, modern, hang, gliders, rocket, powered, aircraft, consume, their, fuel, quickly, and, so, most, must, land, unpowered, unless, there, is, another, power, source, the, first, rocket, plane, was, the, lippisch, ente, and, later, examples, include, the, messerschmitt, me, 163, rocket, powered, interceptor, the, american, series, of, research, aircraft, starting, with, the, bell, x, 1, in, 1946, up, to, the, north, american, x, 15, spent, more, time, flying, unpowered, than, under, power, in, the, 1960s, research, was, also, done, on, unpowered, lifting, bodies, and, on, the, x, 20, dyna, soar, project, but, although, the, x20, was, cancelled, this, research, eventually, led, to, the, space, shuttle, nasa, s, space, shuttle, first, flew, on, april, 12, 1981, the, shuttle, re, entered, at, mach, 25, at, the, end, of, each, spaceflight, landing, entirely, as, a, glider, the, space, shuttle, and, its, soviet, equivalent, the, buran, shuttle, were, by, far, the, fastest, ever, aircraft, recent, examples, of, rocket, glider, include, the, privately, funded, spaceshipone, which, is, intended, for, sub, orbital, flight, and, the, xcor, ez, rocket, which, is, being, used, to, test, engines, most, unpowered, rotary, wing, aircraft, are, kites, rather, than, gliders, i, e, they, are, usually, towed, behind, a, car, or, boat, rather, than, being, capable, of, free, flight, these, are, known, as, rotor, kites, however, rotary, winged, gliders, gyrogliders, were, investigated, that, could, descend, like, an, autogyro, using, the, lift, from, rotors, to, reduce, the, vertical, speed, these, were, evaluated, as, a, method, of, dropping, people, or, equipment, from, other, aircraft, a, paper, plane, paper, aeroplane, uk, paper, airplane, us, paper, glider, paper, dart, or, dart, is, a, toy, aircraft, usually, a, glider, made, out, of, paper, or, paperboard, the, practice, of, constructing, paper, planes, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, aerogami, japanese, kamihik, ki, after, origami, the, japanese, art, of, paper, folding, model, glider, aircraft, are, flying, or, non, flying, models, of, existing, or, imaginary, gliders, often, scaled, down, versions, of, full, size, planes, using, lightweight, materials, such, as, polystyrene, balsa, wood, foam, and, fibreglass, designs, range, from, simple, glider, aircraft, to, accurate, scale, models, some, of, which, can, be, very, large, larger, outdoor, models, are, usually, radio, controlled, gliders, that, are, piloted, remotely, from, the, ground, with, a, transmitter, these, can, remain, airborne, for, extended, periods, by, using, the, lift, produced, by, slopes, and, thermals, these, can, be, winched, into, wind, by, a, line, attached, to, a, hook, under, the, fuselage, with, a, ring, so, that, the, line, will, drop, when, the, model, is, overhead, other, methods, of, launching, include, towing, aloft, using, a, model, powered, aircraft, catapult, launching, using, an, elastic, bungee, cord, and, hand, launching, when, hand, launching, the, newer, discus, style, of, wing, tip, hand, launching, has, largely, supplanted, the, earlier, javelin, type, of, launch, a, glide, bomb, is, a, bomb, with, aerodynamic, surfaces, to, allow, a, gliding, flightpath, rather, than, a, ballistic, one, this, allows, the, bomber, aircraft, to, stand, off, from, the, target, and, launch, the, bomb, from, a, safe, distance, most, types, have, a, remote, control, system, which, enables, the, aircraft, to, direct, the, bomb, accurately, to, the, target, glide, bombs, were, developed, in, germany, from, as, early, as, 1915, in, world, war, ii, they, were, most, successful, as, anti, shipping, weapons, some, air, forces, today, are, equipped, with, gliding, devices, that, can, remotely, attack, airbases, with, a, cluster, bomb, warhead
