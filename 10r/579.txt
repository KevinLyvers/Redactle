holography, is, a, technique, that, enables, a, wavefront, to, be, recorded, and, later, reconstructed, it, is, best, known, as, a, method, of, generating, three, dimensional, images, and, has, a, wide, range, of, other, uses, including, data, storage, microscopy, and, interferometry, in, principle, it, is, possible, to, make, a, hologram, for, any, type, of, wave, a, hologram, is, a, recording, of, an, interference, pattern, that, can, reproduce, a, 3d, light, field, using, diffraction, in, general, usage, a, hologram, is, a, recording, of, any, type, of, wavefront, in, the, form, of, an, interference, pattern, it, can, be, created, by, capturing, light, from, a, real, scene, or, it, can, be, generated, by, a, computer, in, which, case, it, is, known, as, a, computer, generated, hologram, which, can, show, virtual, objects, or, scenes, optical, holography, needs, a, laser, light, to, record, the, light, field, the, reproduced, light, field, can, generate, an, image, that, has, the, depth, and, parallax, of, the, original, scene, a, hologram, is, usually, unintelligible, when, viewed, under, diffuse, ambient, light, when, suitably, lit, the, interference, pattern, diffracts, the, light, into, an, accurate, reproduction, of, the, original, light, field, and, the, objects, that, were, in, it, exhibit, visual, depth, cues, such, as, parallax, and, perspective, that, change, realistically, with, the, different, angles, of, viewing, that, is, the, view, of, the, image, from, different, angles, shows, the, subject, viewed, from, similar, angles, a, hologram, is, traditionally, generated, by, overlaying, a, second, wavefront, known, as, the, reference, beam, onto, a, wavefront, of, interest, this, generates, an, interference, pattern, which, is, then, captured, on, a, physical, medium, when, the, recorded, interference, pattern, is, later, illuminated, by, the, second, wavefront, it, is, diffracted, to, recreate, the, original, wavefront, the, 3d, image, from, a, hologram, can, often, be, viewed, with, non, laser, light, however, in, common, practice, major, image, quality, compromises, are, made, to, remove, the, need, for, laser, illumination, to, view, the, hologram, a, computer, generated, hologram, is, created, by, digitally, modeling, and, combining, two, wavefronts, to, generate, an, interference, pattern, image, this, image, can, then, be, printed, onto, a, mask, or, film, and, illuminated, with, an, appropriate, light, source, to, reconstruct, the, desired, wavefront, alternatively, the, interference, pattern, image, can, be, directly, displayed, on, a, dynamic, holographic, display, holographic, portraiture, often, resorts, to, a, non, holographic, intermediate, imaging, procedure, to, avoid, the, dangerous, high, powered, pulsed, lasers, which, would, be, needed, to, optically, freeze, moving, subjects, as, perfectly, as, the, extremely, motion, intolerant, holographic, recording, process, requires, early, holography, required, high, power, and, expensive, lasers, currently, mass, produced, low, cost, laser, diodes, such, as, those, found, on, dvd, recorders, and, used, in, other, common, applications, can, be, used, to, make, holograms, they, have, made, holography, much, more, accessible, to, low, budget, researchers, artists, and, dedicated, hobbyists, most, holograms, produced, are, of, static, objects, but, systems, for, displaying, changing, scenes, on, dynamic, holographic, displays, are, now, being, developed, the, word, holography, comes, from, the, greek, words, holos, whole, and, graph, writing, or, drawing, the, hungarian, british, physicist, dennis, gabor, invented, holography, in, 1948, while, he, was, looking, for, a, way, to, improve, image, resolution, in, electron, microscopes, gabor, s, work, was, built, on, pioneering, work, in, the, field, of, x, ray, microscopy, by, other, scientists, including, mieczys, aw, wolfke, in, 1920, and, william, lawrence, bragg, in, 1939, the, formulation, of, holography, was, an, unexpected, result, of, gabor, s, research, into, improving, electron, microscopes, at, the, british, thomson, houston, company, bth, in, rugby, england, and, the, company, filed, a, patent, in, december, 1947, patent, gb685286, the, technique, as, originally, invented, is, still, used, in, electron, microscopy, where, it, is, known, as, electron, holography, gabor, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1971, for, his, invention, and, development, of, the, holographic, method, optical, holography, did, not, really, advance, until, the, development, of, the, laser, in, 1960, the, development, of, the, laser, enabled, the, first, practical, optical, holograms, that, recorded, 3d, objects, to, be, made, in, 1962, by, yuri, denisyuk, in, the, soviet, union, and, by, emmett, leith, and, juris, upatnieks, at, the, university, of, michigan, us, early, optical, holograms, used, silver, halide, photographic, emulsions, as, the, recording, medium, they, were, not, very, efficient, as, the, produced, diffraction, grating, absorbed, much, of, the, incident, light, various, methods, of, converting, the, variation, in, transmission, to, a, variation, in, refractive, index, known, as, bleaching, were, developed, which, enabled, much, more, efficient, holograms, to, be, produced, a, major, advance, in, the, field, of, holography, was, made, by, stephen, benton, who, invented, a, way, to, create, holograms, that, can, be, viewed, with, natural, light, instead, of, lasers, these, are, called, rainbow, holograms, holography, is, a, technique, for, recording, and, reconstructing, light, fields, section, 1, a, light, field, is, generally, the, result, of, a, light, source, scattered, off, objects, holography, can, be, thought, of, as, somewhat, similar, to, sound, recording, whereby, a, sound, field, created, by, vibrating, matter, like, musical, instruments, or, vocal, cords, is, encoded, in, such, a, way, that, it, can, be, reproduced, later, without, the, presence, of, the, original, vibrating, matter, however, it, is, even, more, similar, to, ambisonic, sound, recording, in, which, any, listening, angle, of, a, sound, field, can, be, reproduced, in, the, reproduction, in, laser, holography, the, hologram, is, recorded, using, a, source, of, laser, light, which, is, very, pure, in, its, color, and, orderly, in, its, composition, various, setups, may, be, used, and, several, types, of, holograms, can, be, made, but, all, involve, the, interaction, of, light, coming, from, different, directions, and, producing, a, microscopic, interference, pattern, which, a, plate, film, or, other, medium, photographically, records, in, one, common, arrangement, the, laser, beam, is, split, into, two, one, known, as, the, object, beam, and, the, other, as, the, reference, beam, the, object, beam, is, expanded, by, passing, it, through, a, lens, and, used, to, illuminate, the, subject, the, recording, medium, is, located, where, this, light, after, being, reflected, or, scattered, by, the, subject, will, strike, it, the, edges, of, the, medium, will, ultimately, serve, as, a, window, through, which, the, subject, is, seen, so, its, location, is, chosen, with, that, in, mind, the, reference, beam, is, expanded, and, made, to, shine, directly, on, the, medium, where, it, interacts, with, the, light, coming, from, the, subject, to, create, the, desired, interference, pattern, like, conventional, photography, holography, requires, an, appropriate, exposure, time, to, correctly, affect, the, recording, medium, unlike, conventional, photography, during, the, exposure, the, light, source, the, optical, elements, the, recording, medium, and, the, subject, must, all, remain, motionless, relative, to, each, other, to, within, about, a, quarter, of, the, wavelength, of, the, light, or, the, interference, pattern, will, be, blurred, and, the, hologram, spoiled, with, living, subjects, and, some, unstable, materials, that, is, only, possible, if, a, very, intense, and, extremely, brief, pulse, of, laser, light, is, used, a, hazardous, procedure, which, is, rarely, done, outside, of, scientific, and, industrial, laboratory, settings, exposures, lasting, several, seconds, to, several, minutes, using, a, much, lower, powered, continuously, operating, laser, are, typical, a, hologram, can, be, made, by, shining, part, of, the, light, beam, directly, into, the, recording, medium, and, the, other, part, onto, the, object, in, such, a, way, that, some, of, the, scattered, light, falls, onto, the, recording, medium, a, more, flexible, arrangement, for, recording, a, hologram, requires, the, laser, beam, to, be, aimed, through, a, series, of, elements, that, change, it, in, different, ways, the, first, element, is, a, beam, splitter, that, divides, the, beam, into, two, identical, beams, each, aimed, in, different, directions, several, different, materials, can, be, used, as, the, recording, medium, one, of, the, most, common, is, a, film, very, similar, to, photographic, film, silver, halide, photographic, emulsion, but, with, much, smaller, light, reactive, grains, preferably, with, diameters, less, than, 20, nm, making, it, capable, of, the, much, higher, resolution, that, holograms, require, a, layer, of, this, recording, medium, e, g, silver, halide, is, attached, to, a, transparent, substrate, which, is, commonly, glass, but, may, also, be, plastic, when, the, two, laser, beams, reach, the, recording, medium, their, light, waves, intersect, and, interfere, with, each, other, it, is, this, interference, pattern, that, is, imprinted, on, the, recording, medium, the, pattern, itself, is, seemingly, random, as, it, represents, the, way, in, which, the, scene, s, light, interfered, with, the, original, light, source, but, not, the, original, light, source, itself, the, interference, pattern, can, be, considered, an, encoded, version, of, the, scene, requiring, a, particular, key, the, original, light, source, in, order, to, view, its, contents, this, missing, key, is, provided, later, by, shining, a, laser, identical, to, the, one, used, to, record, the, hologram, onto, the, developed, film, when, this, beam, illuminates, the, hologram, it, is, diffracted, by, the, hologram, s, surface, pattern, this, produces, a, light, field, identical, to, the, one, originally, produced, by, the, scene, and, scattered, onto, the, hologram, holography, may, be, better, understood, via, an, examination, of, its, differences, from, ordinary, photography, for, a, better, understanding, of, the, process, it, is, necessary, to, understand, interference, and, diffraction, interference, occurs, when, one, or, more, wavefronts, are, superimposed, diffraction, occurs, when, a, wavefront, encounters, an, object, the, process, of, producing, a, holographic, reconstruction, is, explained, below, purely, in, terms, of, interference, and, diffraction, it, is, somewhat, simplified, but, is, accurate, enough, to, give, an, understanding, of, how, the, holographic, process, works, for, those, unfamiliar, with, these, concepts, it, is, worthwhile, to, read, those, articles, before, reading, further, in, this, article, a, diffraction, grating, is, a, structure, with, a, repeating, pattern, a, simple, example, is, a, metal, plate, with, slits, cut, at, regular, intervals, a, light, wave, that, is, incident, on, a, grating, is, split, into, several, waves, the, direction, of, these, diffracted, waves, is, determined, by, the, grating, spacing, and, the, wavelength, of, the, light, a, simple, hologram, can, be, made, by, superimposing, two, plane, waves, from, the, same, light, source, on, a, holographic, recording, medium, the, two, waves, interfere, giving, a, straight, line, fringe, pattern, whose, intensity, varies, sinusoidally, across, the, medium, the, spacing, of, the, fringe, pattern, is, determined, by, the, angle, between, the, two, waves, and, by, the, wavelength, of, the, light, the, recorded, light, pattern, is, a, diffraction, grating, when, it, is, illuminated, by, only, one, of, the, waves, used, to, create, it, it, can, be, shown, that, one, of, the, diffracted, waves, emerges, at, the, same, angle, at, which, the, second, wave, was, originally, incident, so, that, the, second, wave, has, been, reconstructed, thus, the, recorded, light, pattern, is, a, holographic, recording, as, defined, above, if, the, recording, medium, is, illuminated, with, a, point, source, and, a, normally, incident, plane, wave, the, resulting, pattern, is, a, sinusoidal, zone, plate, which, acts, as, a, negative, fresnel, lens, whose, focal, length, is, equal, to, the, separation, of, the, point, source, and, the, recording, plane, when, a, plane, wave, front, illuminates, a, negative, lens, it, is, expanded, into, a, wave, that, appears, to, diverge, from, the, focal, point, of, the, lens, thus, when, the, recorded, pattern, is, illuminated, with, the, original, plane, wave, some, of, the, light, is, diffracted, into, a, diverging, beam, equivalent, to, the, original, spherical, wave, a, holographic, recording, of, the, point, source, has, been, created, when, the, plane, wave, is, incident, at, a, non, normal, angle, at, the, time, of, recording, the, pattern, formed, is, more, complex, but, still, acts, as, a, negative, lens, if, it, is, illuminated, at, the, original, angle, to, record, a, hologram, of, a, complex, object, a, laser, beam, is, first, split, into, two, beams, of, light, one, beam, illuminates, the, object, which, then, scatters, light, onto, the, recording, medium, according, to, diffraction, theory, each, point, in, the, object, acts, as, a, point, source, of, light, so, the, recording, medium, can, be, considered, to, be, illuminated, by, a, set, of, point, sources, located, at, varying, distances, from, the, medium, the, second, reference, beam, illuminates, the, recording, medium, directly, each, point, source, wave, interferes, with, the, reference, beam, giving, rise, to, its, own, sinusoidal, zone, plate, in, the, recording, medium, the, resulting, pattern, is, the, sum, of, all, these, zone, plates, which, combine, to, produce, a, random, speckle, pattern, as, in, the, photograph, above, when, the, hologram, is, illuminated, by, the, original, reference, beam, each, of, the, individual, zone, plates, reconstructs, the, object, wave, that, produced, it, and, these, individual, wavefronts, are, combined, to, reconstruct, the, whole, of, the, object, beam, the, viewer, perceives, a, wavefront, that, is, identical, with, the, wavefront, scattered, from, the, object, onto, the, recording, medium, so, that, it, appears, that, the, object, is, still, in, place, even, if, it, has, been, removed, early, on, artists, saw, the, potential, of, holography, as, a, medium, and, gained, access, to, science, laboratories, to, create, their, work, holographic, art, is, often, the, result, of, collaborations, between, scientists, and, artists, although, some, holographers, would, regard, themselves, as, both, an, artist, and, a, scientist, salvador, dal, claimed, to, have, been, the, first, to, employ, holography, artistically, he, was, certainly, the, first, and, best, known, surrealist, to, do, so, but, the, 1972, new, york, exhibit, of, dal, holograms, had, been, preceded, by, the, holographic, art, exhibition, that, was, held, at, the, cranbrook, academy, of, art, in, michigan, in, 1968, and, by, the, one, at, the, finch, college, gallery, in, new, york, in, 1970, which, attracted, national, media, attention, in, great, britain, margaret, benyon, began, using, holography, as, an, artistic, medium, in, the, late, 1960s, and, had, a, solo, exhibition, at, the, university, of, nottingham, art, gallery, in, 1969, this, was, followed, in, 1970, by, a, solo, show, at, the, lisson, gallery, in, london, which, was, billed, as, the, first, london, expo, of, holograms, and, stereoscopic, paintings, during, the, 1970s, a, number, of, art, studios, and, schools, were, established, each, with, their, particular, approach, to, holography, notably, there, was, the, san, francisco, school, of, holography, established, by, lloyd, cross, the, museum, of, holography, in, new, york, founded, by, rosemary, posy, h, jackson, the, royal, college, of, art, in, london, and, the, lake, forest, college, symposiums, organised, by, tung, jeong, none, of, these, studios, still, exist, however, there, is, the, center, for, the, holographic, arts, in, new, york, and, the, holocenter, in, seoul, which, offers, artists, a, place, to, create, and, exhibit, work, during, the, 1980s, many, artists, who, worked, with, holography, helped, the, diffusion, of, this, so, called, new, medium, in, the, art, world, such, as, harriet, casdin, silver, of, the, united, states, dieter, jung, of, germany, and, moys, s, baumstein, of, brazil, each, one, searching, for, a, proper, language, to, use, with, the, three, dimensional, work, avoiding, the, simple, holographic, reproduction, of, a, sculpture, or, object, for, instance, in, brazil, many, concrete, poets, augusto, de, campos, d, cio, pignatari, julio, plaza, and, jos, wagner, garcia, associated, with, moys, s, baumstein, found, in, holography, a, way, to, express, themselves, and, to, renew, concrete, poetry, a, small, but, active, group, of, artists, still, integrate, holographic, elements, into, their, work, some, are, associated, with, novel, holographic, techniques, for, example, artist, matt, brand, employed, computational, mirror, design, to, eliminate, image, distortion, from, specular, holography, the, mit, museum, and, jonathan, ross, both, have, extensive, collections, of, holography, and, on, line, catalogues, of, art, holograms, holographic, data, storage, is, a, technique, that, can, store, information, at, high, density, inside, crystals, or, photopolymers, the, ability, to, store, large, amounts, of, information, in, some, kind, of, medium, is, of, great, importance, as, many, electronic, products, incorporate, storage, devices, as, current, storage, techniques, such, as, blu, ray, disc, reach, the, limit, of, possible, data, density, due, to, the, diffraction, limited, size, of, the, writing, beams, holographic, storage, has, the, potential, to, become, the, next, generation, of, popular, storage, media, the, advantage, of, this, type, of, data, storage, is, that, the, volume, of, the, recording, media, is, used, instead, of, just, the, surface, currently, available, slms, can, produce, about, 1000, different, images, a, second, at, 1024, 1024, bit, resolution, which, would, result, in, about, one, gigabit, per, second, writing, speed, in, 2005, companies, such, as, optware, and, maxell, produced, a, 120, mm, disc, that, uses, a, holographic, layer, to, store, data, to, a, potential, 3, 9, tb, a, format, called, holographic, versatile, disc, as, of, september, 2014, no, commercial, product, has, been, released, another, company, inphase, technologies, was, developing, a, competing, format, but, went, bankrupt, in, 2011, and, all, its, assets, were, sold, to, akonia, holographics, llc, while, many, holographic, data, storage, models, have, used, page, based, storage, where, each, recorded, hologram, holds, a, large, amount, of, data, more, recent, research, into, using, submicrometre, sized, microholograms, has, resulted, in, several, potential, 3d, optical, data, storage, solutions, while, this, approach, to, data, storage, can, not, attain, the, high, data, rates, of, page, based, storage, the, tolerances, technological, hurdles, and, cost, of, producing, a, commercial, product, are, significantly, lower, in, static, holography, recording, developing, and, reconstructing, occur, sequentially, and, a, permanent, hologram, is, produced, there, also, exist, holographic, materials, that, do, not, need, the, developing, process, and, can, record, a, hologram, in, a, very, short, time, this, allows, one, to, use, holography, to, perform, some, simple, operations, in, an, all, optical, way, examples, of, applications, of, such, real, time, holograms, include, phase, conjugate, mirrors, time, reversal, of, light, optical, cache, memories, image, processing, pattern, recognition, of, time, varying, images, and, optical, computing, the, amount, of, processed, information, can, be, very, high, terabits, s, since, the, operation, is, performed, in, parallel, on, a, whole, image, this, compensates, for, the, fact, that, the, recording, time, which, is, in, the, order, of, a, microsecond, is, still, very, long, compared, to, the, processing, time, of, an, electronic, computer, the, optical, processing, performed, by, a, dynamic, hologram, is, also, much, less, flexible, than, electronic, processing, on, one, side, one, has, to, perform, the, operation, always, on, the, whole, image, and, on, the, other, side, the, operation, a, hologram, can, perform, is, basically, either, a, multiplication, or, a, phase, conjugation, in, optics, addition, and, fourier, transform, are, already, easily, performed, in, linear, materials, the, latter, simply, by, a, lens, this, enables, some, applications, such, as, a, device, that, compares, images, in, an, optical, way, the, search, for, novel, nonlinear, optical, materials, for, dynamic, holography, is, an, active, area, of, research, the, most, common, materials, are, photorefractive, crystals, but, in, semiconductors, or, semiconductor, heterostructures, such, as, quantum, wells, atomic, vapors, and, gases, plasmas, and, even, liquids, it, was, possible, to, generate, holograms, a, particularly, promising, application, is, optical, phase, conjugation, it, allows, the, removal, of, the, wavefront, distortions, a, light, beam, receives, when, passing, through, an, aberrating, medium, by, sending, it, back, through, the, same, aberrating, medium, with, a, conjugated, phase, this, is, useful, for, example, in, free, space, optical, communications, to, compensate, for, atmospheric, turbulence, the, phenomenon, that, gives, rise, to, the, twinkling, of, starlight, since, the, beginning, of, holography, many, holographers, have, explored, its, uses, and, displayed, them, to, the, public, in, 1971, lloyd, cross, opened, the, san, francisco, school, of, holography, and, taught, amateurs, how, to, make, holograms, using, only, a, small, typically, 5, mw, helium, neon, laser, and, inexpensive, home, made, equipment, holography, had, been, supposed, to, require, a, very, expensive, metal, optical, table, set, up, to, lock, all, the, involved, elements, down, in, place, and, damp, any, vibrations, that, could, blur, the, interference, fringes, and, ruin, the, hologram, cross, s, home, brew, alternative, was, a, sandbox, made, of, a, cinder, block, retaining, wall, on, a, plywood, base, supported, on, stacks, of, old, tires, to, isolate, it, from, ground, vibrations, and, filled, with, sand, that, had, been, washed, to, remove, dust, the, laser, was, securely, mounted, atop, the, cinder, block, wall, the, mirrors, and, simple, lenses, needed, for, directing, splitting, and, expanding, the, laser, beam, were, affixed, to, short, lengths, of, pvc, pipe, which, were, stuck, into, the, sand, at, the, desired, locations, the, subject, and, the, photographic, plate, holder, were, similarly, supported, within, the, sandbox, the, holographer, turned, off, the, room, light, blocked, the, laser, beam, near, its, source, using, a, small, relay, controlled, shutter, loaded, a, plate, into, the, holder, in, the, dark, left, the, room, waited, a, few, minutes, to, let, everything, settle, then, made, the, exposure, by, remotely, operating, the, laser, shutter, in, 1979, jason, sapan, opened, the, holographic, studios, in, new, york, city, since, then, they, have, been, involved, in, the, production, of, many, holographs, for, many, artists, as, well, as, companies, sapan, has, been, described, as, the, last, professional, holographer, of, new, york, many, of, these, holographers, would, go, on, to, produce, art, holograms, in, 1983, fred, unterseher, a, co, founder, of, the, san, francisco, school, of, holography, and, a, well, known, holographic, artist, published, the, holography, handbook, an, easy, to, read, guide, to, making, holograms, at, home, this, brought, in, a, new, wave, of, holographers, and, provided, simple, methods, for, using, the, then, available, agfa, silver, halide, recording, materials, in, 2000, frank, defreitas, published, the, shoebox, holography, book, and, introduced, the, use, of, inexpensive, laser, pointers, to, countless, hobbyists, for, many, years, it, had, been, assumed, that, certain, characteristics, of, semiconductor, laser, diodes, made, them, virtually, useless, for, creating, holograms, but, when, they, were, eventually, put, to, the, test, of, practical, experiment, it, was, found, that, not, only, was, this, untrue, but, that, some, actually, provided, a, coherence, length, much, greater, than, that, of, traditional, helium, neon, gas, lasers, this, was, a, very, important, development, for, amateurs, as, the, price, of, red, laser, diodes, had, dropped, from, hundreds, of, dollars, in, the, early, 1980s, to, about, 5, after, they, entered, the, mass, market, as, a, component, pulled, from, cd, or, later, dvd, players, from, the, mid, 1980s, onwards, now, there, are, thousands, of, amateur, holographers, worldwide, by, late, 2000, holography, kits, with, inexpensive, laser, pointer, diodes, entered, the, mainstream, consumer, market, these, kits, enabled, students, teachers, and, hobbyists, to, make, several, kinds, of, holograms, without, specialized, equipment, and, became, popular, gift, items, by, 2005, the, introduction, of, holography, kits, with, self, developing, plates, in, 2003, made, it, possible, for, hobbyists, to, create, holograms, without, the, bother, of, wet, chemical, processing, in, 2006, a, large, number, of, surplus, holography, quality, green, lasers, coherent, c315, became, available, and, put, dichromated, gelatin, dcg, holography, within, the, reach, of, the, amateur, holographer, the, holography, community, was, surprised, at, the, amazing, sensitivity, of, dcg, to, green, light, it, had, been, assumed, that, this, sensitivity, would, be, uselessly, slight, or, non, existent, jeff, blyth, responded, with, the, g307, formulation, of, dcg, to, increase, the, speed, and, sensitivity, to, these, new, lasers, kodak, and, agfa, the, former, major, suppliers, of, holography, quality, silver, halide, plates, and, films, are, no, longer, in, the, market, while, other, manufacturers, have, helped, fill, the, void, many, amateurs, are, now, making, their, own, materials, the, favorite, formulations, are, dichromated, gelatin, methylene, blue, sensitised, dichromated, gelatin, and, diffusion, method, silver, halide, preparations, jeff, blyth, has, published, very, accurate, methods, for, making, these, in, a, small, lab, or, garage, a, small, group, of, amateurs, are, even, constructing, their, own, pulsed, lasers, to, make, holograms, of, living, subjects, and, other, unsteady, or, moving, objects, holographic, interferometry, hi, is, a, technique, that, enables, static, and, dynamic, displacements, of, objects, with, optically, rough, surfaces, to, be, measured, to, optical, interferometric, precision, i, e, to, fractions, of, a, wavelength, of, light, it, can, also, be, used, to, detect, optical, path, length, variations, in, transparent, media, which, enables, for, example, fluid, flow, to, be, visualized, and, analyzed, it, can, also, be, used, to, generate, contours, representing, the, form, of, the, surface, or, the, isodose, regions, in, radiation, dosimetry, it, has, been, widely, used, to, measure, stress, strain, and, vibration, in, engineering, structures, the, hologram, keeps, the, information, on, the, amplitude, and, phase, of, the, field, several, holograms, may, keep, information, about, the, same, distribution, of, light, emitted, to, various, directions, the, numerical, analysis, of, such, holograms, allows, one, to, emulate, large, numerical, aperture, which, in, turn, enables, enhancement, of, the, resolution, of, optical, microscopy, the, corresponding, technique, is, called, interferometric, microscopy, recent, achievements, of, interferometric, microscopy, allow, one, to, approach, the, quarter, wavelength, limit, of, resolution, the, hologram, is, made, with, a, modified, material, that, interacts, with, certain, molecules, generating, a, change, in, the, fringe, periodicity, or, refractive, index, therefore, the, color, of, the, holographic, reflection, holograms, are, commonly, used, for, security, as, they, are, replicated, from, a, master, hologram, that, requires, expensive, specialized, and, technologically, advanced, equipment, and, are, thus, difficult, to, forge, they, are, used, widely, in, many, currencies, such, as, the, brazilian, 20, 50, and, 100, reais, notes, british, 5, 10, 20, and, 50, pound, notes, south, korean, 5000, 10, 000, and, 50, 000, won, notes, japanese, 5000, and, 10, 000, yen, notes, indian, 50, 100, 500, and, 2000, rupee, notes, and, all, the, currently, circulating, banknotes, of, the, canadian, dollar, croatian, kuna, danish, krone, and, euro, they, can, also, be, found, in, credit, and, bank, cards, as, well, as, passports, id, cards, books, food, packaging, dvds, and, sports, equipment, such, holograms, come, in, a, variety, of, forms, from, adhesive, strips, that, are, laminated, on, packaging, for, fast, moving, consumer, goods, to, holographic, tags, on, electronic, products, they, often, contain, textual, or, pictorial, elements, to, protect, identities, and, separate, genuine, articles, from, counterfeits, holographic, scanners, are, in, use, in, post, offices, larger, shipping, firms, and, automated, conveyor, systems, to, determine, the, three, dimensional, size, of, a, package, they, are, often, used, in, tandem, with, checkweighers, to, allow, automated, pre, packing, of, given, volumes, such, as, a, truck, or, pallet, for, bulk, shipment, of, goods, holograms, produced, in, elastomers, can, be, used, as, stress, strain, reporters, due, to, its, elasticity, and, compressibility, the, pressure, and, force, applied, are, correlated, to, the, reflected, wavelength, therefore, its, color, holography, technique, can, also, be, effectively, used, for, radiation, dosimetry, high, security, holograms, can, be, used, on, license, plates, for, vehicles, such, as, cars, and, motorcycles, as, of, april, 2019, holographic, license, plates, are, required, on, vehicles, in, parts, of, india, to, aid, in, identification, and, security, especially, in, cases, of, car, theft, such, number, plates, hold, electronic, data, of, vehicles, and, have, a, unique, id, number, and, a, sticker, to, indicate, authenticity, in, principle, it, is, possible, to, make, a, hologram, for, any, wave, electron, holography, is, the, application, of, holography, techniques, to, electron, waves, rather, than, light, waves, electron, holography, was, invented, by, dennis, gabor, to, improve, the, resolution, and, avoid, the, aberrations, of, the, transmission, electron, microscope, today, it, is, commonly, used, to, study, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, thin, films, as, magnetic, and, electric, fields, can, shift, the, phase, of, the, interfering, wave, passing, through, the, sample, the, principle, of, electron, holography, can, also, be, applied, to, interference, lithography, acoustic, holography, enables, sound, maps, of, an, object, to, be, generated, measurements, of, the, acoustic, field, are, made, at, many, points, close, to, the, object, these, measurements, are, digitally, processed, to, produce, the, images, of, the, object, atomic, holography, has, evolved, out, of, the, development, of, the, basic, elements, of, atom, optics, with, the, fresnel, diffraction, lens, and, atomic, mirrors, atomic, holography, follows, a, natural, step, in, the, development, of, the, physics, and, applications, of, atomic, beams, recent, developments, including, atomic, mirrors, and, especially, ridged, mirrors, have, provided, the, tools, necessary, for, the, creation, of, atomic, holograms, although, such, holograms, have, not, yet, been, commercialized, neutron, beam, holography, has, been, used, to, see, the, inside, of, solid, objects, holograms, with, x, rays, are, generated, by, using, synchrotrons, or, x, ray, free, electron, lasers, as, radiation, sources, and, pixelated, detectors, such, as, ccds, as, recording, medium, the, reconstruction, is, then, retrieved, via, computation, due, to, the, shorter, wavelength, of, x, rays, compared, to, visible, light, this, approach, allows, imaging, objects, with, higher, spatial, resolution, as, free, electron, lasers, can, provide, ultrashort, and, x, ray, pulses, in, the, range, of, femtoseconds, which, are, intense, and, coherent, x, ray, holography, has, been, used, to, capture, ultrafast, dynamic, processes, there, are, many, optical, effects, that, are, falsely, confused, with, holography, such, as, the, effects, produced, by, lenticular, printing, the, pepper, s, ghost, illusion, or, modern, variants, such, as, the, musion, eyeliner, tomography, and, volumetric, displays, such, illusions, have, been, called, fauxlography, the, pepper, s, ghost, technique, being, the, easiest, to, implement, of, these, methods, is, most, prevalent, in, 3d, displays, that, claim, to, be, or, are, referred, to, as, holographic, while, the, original, illusion, used, in, theater, involved, actual, physical, objects, and, persons, located, offstage, modern, variants, replace, the, source, object, with, a, digital, screen, which, displays, imagery, generated, with, 3d, computer, graphics, to, provide, the, necessary, depth, cues, the, reflection, which, seems, to, float, mid, air, is, still, flat, however, thus, less, realistic, than, if, an, actual, 3d, object, was, being, reflected, examples, of, this, digital, version, of, pepper, s, ghost, illusion, include, the, gorillaz, performances, in, the, 2005, mtv, europe, music, awards, and, the, 48th, grammy, awards, and, tupac, shakur, s, virtual, performance, at, coachella, valley, music, and, arts, festival, in, 2012, rapping, alongside, snoop, dogg, during, his, set, with, dr, dre, digital, avatars, of, the, swedish, supergroup, abba, were, displayed, on, stage, in, may, 2022, the, abba, performance, used, technology, that, was, an, updated, version, of, pepper, s, ghost, created, by, industrial, light, magic, american, rock, group, kiss, unveiled, similar, digital, avatars, in, december, 2023, to, tour, in, their, place, at, the, conclusion, of, the, end, of, the, road, world, tour, using, the, same, pepper, s, ghost, technology, as, the, abba, avatars, an, even, simpler, illusion, can, be, created, by, rear, projecting, realistic, images, into, semi, transparent, screens, the, rear, projection, is, necessary, because, otherwise, the, semi, transparency, of, the, screen, would, allow, the, background, to, be, illuminated, by, the, projection, which, would, break, the, illusion, crypton, future, media, a, music, software, company, that, produced, hatsune, miku, one, of, many, vocaloid, singing, synthesizer, applications, has, produced, concerts, that, have, miku, along, with, other, crypton, vocaloids, performing, on, stage, as, holographic, characters, these, concerts, use, rear, projection, onto, a, semi, transparent, dilad, screen, to, achieve, its, holographic, effect, in, 2011, in, beijing, apparel, company, burberry, produced, the, burberry, prorsum, autumn, winter, 2011, hologram, runway, show, which, included, life, size, 2, d, projections, of, models, the, company, s, own, video, shows, several, centered, and, off, center, shots, of, the, main, 2, dimensional, projection, screen, the, latter, revealing, the, flatness, of, the, virtual, models, the, claim, that, holography, was, used, was, reported, as, fact, in, the, trade, media, in, madrid, on, 10, april, 2015, a, public, visual, presentation, called, hologramas, por, la, libertad, holograms, for, liberty, featuring, a, ghostly, virtual, crowd, of, demonstrators, was, used, to, protest, a, new, spanish, law, that, prohibits, citizens, from, demonstrating, in, public, places, although, widely, called, a, hologram, protest, in, news, reports, no, actual, holography, was, involved, it, was, yet, another, technologically, updated, variant, of, the, pepper, s, ghost, illusion, holography, is, distinct, from, specular, holography, which, is, a, technique, for, making, three, dimensional, images, by, controlling, the, motion, of, specularities, on, a, two, dimensional, surface, it, works, by, reflectively, or, refractively, manipulating, bundles, of, light, rays, not, by, using, interference, and, diffraction, holography, has, been, widely, referred, to, in, movies, novels, and, tv, usually, in, science, fiction, starting, in, the, late, 1970s, science, fiction, writers, absorbed, the, urban, legends, surrounding, holography, that, had, been, spread, by, overly, enthusiastic, scientists, and, entrepreneurs, trying, to, market, the, idea, this, had, the, effect, of, giving, the, public, overly, high, expectations, of, the, capability, of, holography, due, to, the, unrealistic, depictions, of, it, in, most, fiction, where, they, are, fully, three, dimensional, computer, projections, that, are, sometimes, tactile, through, the, use, of, force, fields, examples, of, this, type, of, depiction, include, the, hologram, of, princess, leia, in, star, wars, arnold, rimmer, from, red, dwarf, who, was, later, converted, to, hard, light, to, make, him, solid, and, the, holodeck, and, emergency, medical, hologram, from, star, trek, holography, has, served, as, an, inspiration, for, many, video, games, with, science, fiction, elements, in, many, titles, fictional, holographic, technology, has, been, used, to, reflect, real, life, misrepresentations, of, potential, military, use, of, holograms, such, as, the, mirage, tanks, in, command, conquer, red, alert, 2, that, can, disguise, themselves, as, trees, player, characters, are, able, to, use, holographic, decoys, in, games, such, as, halo, reach, and, crysis, 2, to, confuse, and, distract, the, enemy, starcraft, ghost, agent, nova, has, access, to, holo, decoy, as, one, of, her, three, primary, abilities, in, heroes, of, the, storm, fictional, depictions, of, holograms, have, however, inspired, technological, advances, in, other, fields, such, as, augmented, reality, that, promise, to, fulfill, the, fictional, depictions, of, holograms, by, other, means
