transport, in, british, english, or, transportation, in, american, english, is, the, intentional, movement, of, humans, animals, and, goods, from, one, location, to, another, modes, of, transport, include, air, land, rail, and, road, water, cable, pipelines, and, space, the, field, can, be, divided, into, infrastructure, vehicles, and, operations, transport, enables, human, trade, which, is, essential, for, the, development, of, civilizations, transport, infrastructure, consists, of, both, fixed, installations, including, roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals, and, pipelines, and, terminals, such, as, airports, railway, stations, bus, stations, warehouses, trucking, terminals, refueling, depots, including, fuel, docks, and, fuel, stations, and, seaports, terminals, may, be, used, both, for, the, interchange, of, passengers, and, cargo, and, for, maintenance, means, of, transport, are, any, of, the, different, kinds, of, transport, facilities, used, to, carry, people, or, cargo, they, may, include, vehicles, riding, animals, and, pack, animals, vehicles, may, include, wagons, automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft, and, aircraft, a, mode, of, transport, is, a, solution, that, makes, use, of, a, certain, type, of, vehicle, infrastructure, and, operation, the, transport, of, a, person, or, of, cargo, may, involve, one, mode, or, several, of, the, modes, with, the, latter, case, being, called, inter, modal, or, multi, modal, transport, each, mode, has, its, own, advantages, and, disadvantages, and, will, be, chosen, on, the, basis, of, cost, capability, and, route, governments, deal, with, the, way, the, vehicles, are, operated, and, the, procedures, set, for, this, purpose, including, financing, legalities, and, policies, in, the, transport, industry, operations, and, ownership, of, infrastructure, can, be, either, public, or, private, depending, on, the, country, and, mode, passenger, transport, may, be, public, where, operators, provide, scheduled, services, or, private, freight, transport, has, become, focused, on, containerization, although, bulk, transport, is, used, for, large, volumes, of, durable, items, transport, plays, an, important, part, in, economic, growth, and, globalization, but, most, types, cause, air, pollution, and, use, large, amounts, of, land, while, it, is, heavily, subsidized, by, governments, good, planning, of, transport, is, essential, to, make, traffic, flow, and, restrain, urban, sprawl, human, powered, transport, a, form, of, sustainable, transport, is, the, transport, of, people, or, goods, using, human, muscle, power, in, the, form, of, walking, running, and, swimming, modern, technology, has, allowed, machines, to, enhance, human, power, human, powered, transport, remains, popular, for, reasons, of, cost, saving, leisure, physical, exercise, and, environmentalism, it, is, sometimes, the, only, type, available, especially, in, underdeveloped, or, inaccessible, regions, although, humans, are, able, to, walk, without, infrastructure, the, transport, can, be, enhanced, through, the, use, of, roads, especially, when, using, the, human, power, with, vehicles, such, as, bicycles, and, inline, skates, human, powered, vehicles, have, also, been, developed, for, difficult, environments, such, as, snow, and, water, by, watercraft, rowing, and, skiing, even, the, air, can, be, entered, with, human, powered, aircraft, animal, powered, transport, is, the, use, of, working, animals, for, the, movement, of, people, and, commodities, humans, may, ride, some, of, the, animals, directly, use, them, as, pack, animals, for, carrying, goods, or, harness, them, alone, or, in, teams, to, pull, sleds, or, wheeled, vehicles, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, commonly, called, an, airplane, is, a, heavier, than, air, craft, where, movement, of, the, air, in, relation, to, the, wings, is, used, to, generate, lift, the, term, is, used, to, distinguish, this, from, rotary, wing, aircraft, where, the, movement, of, the, lift, surfaces, relative, to, the, air, generates, lift, a, gyroplane, is, both, fixed, wing, and, rotary, wing, fixed, wing, aircraft, range, from, small, trainers, and, recreational, aircraft, to, large, airliners, and, military, cargo, aircraft, two, things, necessary, for, aircraft, are, air, flow, over, the, wings, for, lift, and, an, area, for, landing, the, majority, of, aircraft, also, need, an, airport, with, the, infrastructure, for, maintenance, restocking, and, refueling, and, for, the, loading, and, unloading, of, crew, cargo, and, passengers, while, the, vast, majority, of, aircraft, land, and, take, off, on, land, some, are, capable, of, take, off, and, landing, on, ice, snow, and, calm, water, the, aircraft, is, the, second, fastest, method, of, transport, after, the, rocket, commercial, jets, can, reach, up, to, 955, kilometres, per, hour, 593, mph, single, engine, aircraft, 555, kilometres, per, hour, 345, mph, aviation, is, able, to, quickly, transport, people, and, limited, amounts, of, cargo, over, longer, distances, but, incurs, high, costs, and, energy, use, for, short, distances, or, in, inaccessible, places, helicopters, can, be, used, as, of, april, 28, 2009, the, guardian, article, notes, that, the, who, estimates, that, up, to, 500, 000, people, are, on, planes, at, any, time, land, transport, covers, all, land, based, transport, systems, that, provide, for, the, movement, of, people, goods, and, services, land, transport, plays, a, vital, role, in, linking, communities, to, each, other, land, transport, is, a, key, factor, in, urban, planning, it, consists, of, two, kinds, rail, and, road, rail, transport, is, where, a, train, runs, along, a, set, of, two, parallel, steel, rails, known, as, a, railway, or, railroad, the, rails, are, anchored, perpendicular, to, ties, or, sleepers, of, timber, concrete, or, steel, to, maintain, a, consistent, distance, apart, or, gauge, the, rails, and, perpendicular, beams, are, placed, on, a, foundation, made, of, concrete, or, compressed, earth, and, gravel, in, a, bed, of, ballast, alternative, methods, include, monorail, and, maglev, a, train, consists, of, one, or, more, connected, vehicles, that, operate, on, the, rails, propulsion, is, commonly, provided, by, a, locomotive, that, hauls, a, series, of, unpowered, cars, that, can, carry, passengers, or, freight, the, locomotive, can, be, powered, by, steam, by, diesel, or, by, electricity, supplied, by, trackside, systems, alternatively, some, or, all, the, cars, can, be, powered, known, as, a, multiple, unit, also, a, train, can, be, powered, by, horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics, and, gas, turbines, railed, vehicles, move, with, much, less, friction, than, rubber, tires, on, paved, roads, making, trains, more, energy, efficient, though, not, as, efficient, as, ships, intercity, trains, are, long, haul, services, connecting, cities, modern, high, speed, rail, is, capable, of, speeds, up, to, 350, km, h, 220, mph, but, this, requires, specially, built, track, regional, and, commuter, trains, feed, cities, from, suburbs, and, surrounding, areas, while, intra, urban, transport, is, performed, by, high, capacity, tramways, and, rapid, transits, often, making, up, the, backbone, of, a, city, s, public, transport, freight, trains, traditionally, used, box, cars, requiring, manual, loading, and, unloading, of, the, cargo, since, the, 1960s, container, trains, have, become, the, dominant, solution, for, general, freight, while, large, quantities, of, bulk, are, transported, by, dedicated, trains, a, road, is, an, identifiable, route, way, or, path, between, two, or, more, places, roads, are, typically, smoothed, paved, or, otherwise, prepared, to, allow, easy, travel, though, they, need, not, be, and, historically, many, roads, were, simply, recognizable, routes, without, any, formal, construction, or, maintenance, in, urban, areas, roads, may, pass, through, a, city, or, village, and, be, named, as, streets, serving, a, dual, function, as, urban, space, easement, and, route, the, most, common, road, vehicle, is, the, automobile, a, wheeled, passenger, vehicle, that, carries, its, own, motor, other, users, of, roads, include, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and, pedestrians, as, of, 2010, there, were, 1, 015, billion, automobiles, worldwide, road, transport, offers, complete, freedom, to, road, users, to, transfer, the, vehicle, from, one, lane, to, the, other, and, from, one, road, to, another, according, to, the, need, and, convenience, this, flexibility, of, changes, in, location, direction, speed, and, timings, of, travel, is, not, available, to, other, modes, of, transport, it, is, possible, to, provide, door, to, door, service, only, by, road, transport, automobiles, provide, high, flexibility, with, low, capacity, but, require, high, energy, and, area, use, and, are, the, main, source, of, harmful, noise, and, air, pollution, in, cities, buses, allow, for, more, efficient, travel, at, the, cost, of, reduced, flexibility, road, transport, by, truck, is, often, the, initial, and, final, stage, of, freight, transport, water, transport, is, movement, by, means, of, a, watercraft, such, as, a, barge, boat, ship, or, sailboat, over, a, body, of, water, such, as, a, sea, ocean, lake, canal, or, river, the, need, for, buoyancy, is, common, to, watercraft, making, the, hull, a, dominant, aspect, of, its, construction, maintenance, and, appearance, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, steam, ships, were, developed, using, a, steam, engine, to, drive, a, paddle, wheel, or, propeller, to, move, the, ship, the, steam, was, produced, in, a, boiler, using, wood, or, coal, and, fed, through, a, steam, external, combustion, engine, now, most, ships, have, an, internal, combustion, engine, using, a, slightly, refined, type, of, petroleum, called, bunker, fuel, some, ships, such, as, submarines, use, nuclear, power, to, produce, the, steam, recreational, or, educational, craft, still, use, wind, power, while, some, smaller, craft, use, internal, combustion, engines, to, drive, one, or, more, propellers, or, in, the, case, of, jet, boats, an, inboard, water, jet, in, shallow, draft, areas, hovercraft, are, propelled, by, large, pusher, prop, fans, see, marine, propulsion, although, it, is, slow, compared, to, other, transport, modern, sea, transport, is, a, highly, efficient, method, of, transporting, large, quantities, of, goods, commercial, vessels, nearly, 35, 000, in, number, carried, 7, 4, billion, tons, of, cargo, in, 2007, transport, by, water, is, significantly, less, costly, than, air, transport, for, transcontinental, shipping, short, sea, shipping, and, ferries, remain, viable, in, coastal, areas, pipeline, transport, sends, goods, through, a, pipe, most, commonly, liquid, and, gases, are, sent, but, pneumatic, tubes, can, also, send, solid, capsules, using, compressed, air, for, liquids, gases, any, chemically, stable, liquid, or, gas, can, be, sent, through, a, pipeline, short, distance, systems, exist, for, sewage, slurry, water, and, beer, while, long, distance, networks, are, used, for, petroleum, and, natural, gas, cable, transport, is, a, broad, mode, where, vehicles, are, pulled, by, cables, instead, of, an, internal, power, source, it, is, most, commonly, used, at, steep, gradient, typical, solutions, include, aerial, tramways, elevators, and, ski, lifts, some, of, these, are, also, categorized, as, conveyor, transport, spaceflight, is, transport, outside, earth, s, atmosphere, by, means, of, a, spacecraft, it, is, most, frequently, used, for, satellites, placed, in, earth, orbit, however, human, spaceflight, mission, have, landed, on, the, moon, and, are, occasionally, used, to, rotate, crew, members, to, space, stations, uncrewed, spacecraft, have, also, been, sent, to, all, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, suborbital, spaceflight, is, the, fastest, of, the, existing, and, planned, transport, systems, from, a, place, on, earth, to, a, distant, other, place, on, earth, faster, transport, could, be, achieved, through, part, of, a, low, earth, orbit, or, by, following, that, trajectory, even, faster, using, the, propulsion, of, the, rocket, to, steer, it, infrastructure, is, the, fixed, installations, that, allow, a, vehicle, to, operate, it, consists, of, a, roadway, a, terminal, and, facilities, for, parking, and, maintenance, for, rail, pipeline, road, and, cable, transport, the, entire, way, the, vehicle, travels, must, be, constructed, air, and, watercraft, are, able, to, avoid, this, since, the, airway, and, seaway, do, not, need, to, be, constructed, however, they, require, fixed, infrastructure, at, terminals, terminals, such, as, airports, ports, and, stations, are, locations, where, passengers, and, freight, can, be, transferred, from, one, vehicle, or, mode, to, another, for, passenger, transport, terminals, are, integrating, different, modes, to, allow, riders, who, are, interchanging, between, modes, to, take, advantage, of, each, mode, s, benefits, for, instance, airport, rail, links, connect, airports, to, the, city, centres, and, suburbs, the, terminals, for, automobiles, are, parking, lots, while, buses, and, coaches, can, operate, from, simple, stops, for, freight, terminals, act, as, transshipment, points, though, some, cargo, is, transported, directly, from, the, point, of, production, to, the, point, of, use, the, financing, of, infrastructure, can, either, be, public, or, private, transport, is, often, a, natural, monopoly, and, a, necessity, for, the, public, roads, and, in, some, countries, railways, and, airports, are, funded, through, taxation, new, infrastructure, projects, can, have, high, costs, and, are, often, financed, through, debt, many, infrastructure, owners, therefore, impose, usage, fees, such, as, landing, fees, at, airports, or, toll, plazas, on, roads, independent, of, this, authorities, may, impose, taxes, on, the, purchase, or, use, of, vehicles, because, of, poor, forecasting, and, overestimation, of, passenger, numbers, by, planners, there, is, frequently, a, benefits, shortfall, for, transport, infrastructure, projects, animals, used, in, transportation, include, pack, animals, and, riding, animals, a, vehicle, is, a, non, living, device, that, is, used, to, move, people, and, goods, unlike, the, infrastructure, the, vehicle, moves, along, with, the, cargo, and, riders, unless, being, pulled, pushed, by, a, cable, or, muscle, power, the, vehicle, must, provide, its, own, propulsion, this, is, most, commonly, done, through, a, steam, engine, combustion, engine, electric, motor, jet, engine, or, rocket, though, other, means, of, propulsion, also, exist, vehicles, also, need, a, system, of, converting, the, energy, into, movement, this, is, most, commonly, done, through, wheels, propellers, and, pressure, vehicles, are, most, commonly, staffed, by, a, driver, however, some, systems, such, as, people, movers, and, some, rapid, transits, are, fully, automated, for, passenger, transport, the, vehicle, must, have, a, compartment, seat, or, platform, for, the, passengers, simple, vehicles, such, as, automobiles, bicycles, or, simple, aircraft, may, have, one, of, the, passengers, as, a, driver, recently, the, progress, related, to, the, fourth, industrial, revolution, has, brought, a, lot, of, new, emerging, technologies, for, transportation, and, automotive, fields, such, as, connected, vehicles, and, autonomous, driving, these, innovations, are, said, to, form, future, mobility, but, concerns, remain, on, safety, and, cybersecurity, particularly, concerning, connected, and, autonomous, mobility, private, transport, is, only, subject, to, the, owner, of, the, vehicle, who, operates, the, vehicle, themselves, for, public, transport, and, freight, transport, operations, are, done, through, private, enterprise, or, by, governments, the, infrastructure, and, vehicles, may, be, owned, and, operated, by, the, same, company, or, they, may, be, operated, by, different, entities, traditionally, many, countries, have, had, a, national, airline, and, national, railway, since, the, 1980s, many, of, these, have, been, privatized, international, shipping, remains, a, highly, competitive, industry, with, little, regulation, but, ports, can, be, public, owned, as, the, population, of, the, world, increases, cities, grow, in, size, and, population, according, to, the, united, nations, 55, of, the, world, s, population, live, in, cities, and, by, 2050, this, number, is, expected, to, rise, to, 68, public, transport, policy, must, evolve, to, meet, the, changing, priorities, of, the, urban, world, the, institution, of, policy, enforces, order, in, transport, which, is, by, nature, chaotic, as, people, attempt, to, travel, from, one, place, to, another, as, fast, as, possible, this, policy, helps, to, reduce, accidents, and, save, lives, relocation, of, travelers, and, cargo, are, the, most, common, uses, of, transport, however, other, uses, exist, such, as, the, strategic, and, tactical, relocation, of, armed, forces, during, warfare, or, the, civilian, mobility, construction, or, emergency, equipment, passenger, transport, or, travel, is, divided, into, public, and, private, transport, public, transport, is, scheduled, services, on, fixed, routes, while, private, is, vehicles, that, provide, ad, hoc, services, at, the, riders, desire, the, latter, offers, better, flexibility, but, has, lower, capacity, and, a, higher, environmental, impact, travel, may, be, as, part, of, daily, commuting, or, for, business, leisure, or, migration, short, haul, transport, is, dominated, by, the, automobile, and, mass, transit, the, latter, consists, of, buses, in, rural, and, small, cities, supplemented, with, commuter, rail, trams, and, rapid, transit, in, larger, cities, long, haul, transport, involves, the, use, of, the, automobile, trains, coaches, and, aircraft, the, last, of, which, have, become, predominantly, used, for, the, longest, including, intercontinental, travel, intermodal, passenger, transport, is, where, a, journey, is, performed, through, the, use, of, several, modes, of, transport, since, all, human, transport, normally, starts, and, ends, with, walking, all, passenger, transport, can, be, considered, intermodal, public, transport, may, also, involve, the, intermediate, change, of, vehicle, within, or, across, modes, at, a, transport, hub, such, as, a, bus, or, railway, station, taxis, and, buses, can, be, found, on, both, ends, of, the, public, transport, spectrum, buses, are, the, cheapest, mode, of, transport, but, are, not, necessarily, flexible, and, taxis, are, very, flexible, but, more, expensive, in, the, middle, is, demand, responsive, transport, offering, flexibility, whilst, remaining, affordable, international, travel, may, be, restricted, for, some, individuals, due, to, legislation, and, visa, requirements, an, ambulance, is, a, vehicle, used, to, transport, people, from, or, between, places, of, treatment, and, in, some, instances, will, also, provide, out, of, hospital, medical, care, to, the, patient, the, word, is, often, associated, with, road, going, emergency, ambulances, which, form, part, of, emergency, medical, services, administering, emergency, care, to, those, with, acute, medical, problems, air, medical, services, is, a, comprehensive, term, covering, the, use, of, air, transport, to, move, patients, to, and, from, healthcare, facilities, and, accident, scenes, personnel, provide, comprehensive, prehospital, and, emergency, and, critical, care, to, all, types, of, patients, during, aeromedical, evacuation, or, rescue, operations, aboard, helicopters, propeller, aircraft, or, jet, aircraft, freight, transport, or, shipping, is, a, key, in, the, value, chain, in, manufacturing, with, increased, specialization, and, globalization, production, is, being, located, further, away, from, consumption, rapidly, increasing, the, demand, for, transport, transport, creates, place, utility, by, moving, the, goods, from, the, place, of, production, to, the, place, of, consumption, while, all, modes, of, transport, are, used, for, cargo, transport, there, is, high, differentiation, between, the, nature, of, the, cargo, transport, in, which, mode, is, chosen, logistics, refers, to, the, entire, process, of, transferring, products, from, producer, to, consumer, including, storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material, handling, and, packaging, with, associated, exchange, of, information, incoterm, deals, with, the, handling, of, payment, and, responsibility, of, risk, during, transport, containerization, with, the, standardization, of, iso, containers, on, all, vehicles, and, at, all, ports, has, revolutionized, international, and, domestic, trade, offering, a, huge, reduction, in, transshipment, costs, traditionally, all, cargo, had, to, be, manually, loaded, and, unloaded, into, the, haul, of, any, ship, or, car, containerization, allows, for, automated, handling, and, transfer, between, modes, and, the, standardized, sizes, allow, for, gains, in, economy, of, scale, in, vehicle, operation, this, has, been, one, of, the, key, driving, factors, in, international, trade, and, globalization, since, the, 1950s, bulk, transport, is, common, with, cargo, that, can, be, handled, roughly, without, deterioration, typical, examples, are, ore, coal, cereals, and, petroleum, because, of, the, uniformity, of, the, product, mechanical, handling, can, allow, enormous, quantities, to, be, handled, quickly, and, efficiently, the, low, value, of, the, cargo, combined, with, high, volume, also, means, that, economies, of, scale, become, essential, in, transport, and, gigantic, ships, and, whole, trains, are, commonly, used, to, transport, bulk, liquid, products, with, sufficient, volume, may, also, be, transported, by, pipeline, air, freight, has, become, more, common, for, products, of, high, value, while, less, than, one, percent, of, world, transport, by, volume, is, by, airline, it, amounts, to, forty, percent, of, the, value, time, has, become, especially, important, in, regards, to, principles, such, as, postponement, and, just, in, time, within, the, value, chain, resulting, in, a, high, willingness, to, pay, for, quick, delivery, of, key, components, or, items, of, high, value, to, weight, ratio, in, addition, to, mail, common, items, sent, by, air, include, electronics, and, fashion, clothing, transport, is, a, key, necessity, for, specialization, allowing, production, and, consumption, of, products, to, occur, at, different, locations, throughout, history, transport, has, been, a, spur, to, expansion, better, transport, allows, more, trade, and, a, greater, spread, of, people, economic, growth, has, always, been, dependent, on, increasing, the, capacity, and, rationality, of, transport, but, the, infrastructure, and, operation, of, transport, have, a, great, impact, on, the, land, and, transport, is, the, largest, drainer, of, energy, making, transport, sustainability, a, major, issue, due, to, the, way, modern, cities, and, communities, are, planned, and, operated, a, physical, distinction, between, home, and, work, is, usually, created, forcing, people, to, transport, themselves, to, places, of, work, study, or, leisure, as, well, as, to, temporarily, relocate, for, other, daily, activities, passenger, transport, is, also, the, essence, of, tourism, a, major, part, of, recreational, transport, commerce, requires, the, transport, of, people, to, conduct, business, either, to, allow, face, to, face, communication, for, important, decisions, or, to, move, specialists, from, their, regular, place, of, work, to, sites, where, they, are, needed, in, lean, thinking, transporting, materials, or, work, in, process, from, one, location, to, another, is, seen, as, one, of, the, seven, wastes, japanese, term, muda, which, do, not, add, value, to, a, product, transport, planning, allows, for, high, use, and, less, impact, regarding, new, infrastructure, using, models, of, transport, forecasting, planners, are, able, to, predict, future, transport, patterns, on, the, operative, level, logistics, allows, owners, of, cargo, to, plan, transport, as, part, of, the, supply, chain, transport, as, a, field, is, also, studied, through, transport, economics, a, component, for, the, creation, of, regulation, policy, by, authorities, transport, engineering, a, sub, discipline, of, civil, engineering, must, take, into, account, trip, generation, trip, distribution, mode, choice, and, route, assignment, while, the, operative, level, is, handled, through, traffic, engineering, because, of, the, negative, impacts, incurred, transport, often, becomes, the, subject, of, controversy, related, to, choice, of, mode, as, well, as, increased, capacity, automotive, transport, can, be, seen, as, a, tragedy, of, the, commons, where, the, flexibility, and, comfort, for, the, individual, deteriorate, the, natural, and, urban, environment, for, all, density, of, development, depends, on, mode, of, transport, with, public, transport, allowing, for, better, spatial, use, good, land, use, keeps, common, activities, close, to, people, s, homes, and, places, higher, density, development, closer, to, transport, lines, and, hubs, to, minimize, the, need, for, transport, there, are, economies, of, agglomeration, beyond, transport, some, land, uses, are, more, efficient, when, clustered, transport, facilities, consume, land, and, in, cities, pavement, devoted, to, streets, and, parking, can, easily, exceed, 20, percent, of, the, total, land, use, an, efficient, transport, system, can, reduce, land, waste, too, much, infrastructure, and, too, much, smoothing, for, maximum, vehicle, throughput, mean, that, in, many, cities, there, is, too, much, traffic, and, many, if, not, all, of, the, negative, impacts, that, come, with, it, it, is, only, in, recent, years, that, traditional, practices, have, started, to, be, questioned, in, many, places, as, a, result, of, new, types, of, analysis, which, bring, in, a, much, broader, range, of, skills, than, those, traditionally, relied, on, spanning, such, areas, as, environmental, impact, analysis, public, health, sociology, and, economics, the, viability, of, the, old, mobility, solutions, is, increasingly, being, questioned, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, transportation, transport, is, a, major, use, of, energy, and, burns, most, of, the, world, s, petroleum, this, creates, air, pollution, including, nitrous, oxides, and, particulates, and, is, a, significant, contributor, to, global, warming, through, emission, of, carbon, dioxide, for, which, transport, is, the, fastest, growing, emission, sector, by, sub, sector, road, transport, is, the, largest, contributor, to, global, warming, environmental, regulations, in, developed, countries, have, reduced, individual, vehicles, emissions, however, this, has, been, offset, by, increases, in, the, numbers, of, vehicles, and, in, the, use, of, each, vehicle, some, pathways, to, reduce, the, carbon, emissions, of, road, vehicles, considerably, have, been, studied, energy, use, and, emissions, vary, largely, between, modes, causing, environmentalists, to, call, for, a, transition, from, air, and, road, to, rail, and, human, powered, transport, as, well, as, increased, transport, electrification, and, energy, efficiency, other, environmental, impacts, of, transport, systems, include, traffic, congestion, and, automobile, oriented, urban, sprawl, which, can, consume, natural, habitat, and, agricultural, lands, by, reducing, transport, emissions, globally, it, is, predicted, that, there, will, be, significant, positive, effects, on, earth, s, air, quality, acid, rain, smog, and, climate, change, while, electric, cars, are, being, built, to, cut, down, co, 2, emission, at, the, point, of, use, an, approach, that, is, becoming, popular, among, cities, worldwide, is, to, prioritize, public, transport, bicycles, and, pedestrian, movement, redirecting, vehicle, movement, to, create, 20, minute, neighbourhoods, that, promotes, exercise, while, greatly, reducing, vehicle, dependency, and, pollution, some, policies, are, levying, a, congestion, charge, to, cars, for, travelling, within, congested, areas, during, peak, time, airplane, emissions, change, depending, on, the, flight, distance, it, takes, a, lot, of, energy, to, take, off, and, land, so, longer, flights, are, more, efficient, per, mile, traveled, however, longer, flights, naturally, use, more, fuel, in, total, short, flights, produce, the, most, co, 2, per, passenger, mile, while, long, flights, produce, slightly, less, things, get, worse, when, planes, fly, high, in, the, atmosphere, their, emissions, trap, much, more, heat, than, those, released, at, ground, level, this, isn, t, just, because, of, co, 2, but, a, mix, of, other, greenhouse, gases, in, the, exhaust, city, buses, produce, about, 0, 3, kg, of, co, 2, for, every, mile, traveled, per, passenger, for, long, distance, bus, trips, over, 20, miles, that, pollution, drops, to, about, 0, 08, kg, of, co, 2, per, passenger, mile, on, average, commuter, trains, produce, around, 0, 17, kg, of, co, 2, for, each, mile, traveled, per, passenger, long, distance, trains, are, slightly, higher, at, about, 0, 19, kg, of, co, 2, per, passenger, mile, the, fleet, emission, average, for, delivery, vans, trucks, and, big, rigs, is, 10, 17, kg, 22, 4, lb, co, 2, per, gallon, of, diesel, consumed, delivery, vans, and, trucks, average, about, 7, 8, mpg, or, 1, 3, kg, of, co, 2, per, mile, while, big, rigs, average, about, 5, 3, mpg, or, 1, 92, kg, of, co, 2, per, mile, the, united, nations, first, formally, recognized, the, role, of, transport, in, sustainable, development, in, the, 1992, united, nations, earth, summit, in, the, 2012, united, nations, world, conference, global, leaders, unanimously, recognized, that, transport, and, mobility, are, central, to, achieving, the, sustainability, targets, in, recent, years, data, has, been, collected, to, show, that, the, transport, sector, contributes, to, a, quarter, of, the, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, therefore, sustainable, transport, has, been, mainstreamed, across, several, of, the, 2030, sustainable, development, goals, especially, those, related, to, food, security, health, energy, economic, growth, infrastructure, and, cities, and, human, settlements, meeting, sustainable, transport, targets, is, said, to, be, particularly, important, to, achieving, the, paris, agreement, there, are, various, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, that, are, promoting, sustainable, transport, to, meet, the, defined, goals, these, include, sdg, 3, on, health, increased, road, safety, sdg, 7, on, energy, sdg, 8, on, decent, work, and, economic, growth, sdg, 9, on, resilient, infrastructure, sdg, 11, on, sustainable, cities, access, to, transport, and, expanded, public, transport, sdg, 12, on, sustainable, consumption, and, production, ending, fossil, fuel, subsidies, and, sdg, 14, on, oceans, seas, and, marine, resources, humans, first, ways, to, move, included, walking, running, and, swimming, the, domestication, of, animals, introduced, a, new, way, to, lay, the, burden, of, transport, on, more, powerful, creatures, allowing, the, hauling, of, heavier, loads, or, humans, riding, animals, for, greater, speed, and, duration, inventions, such, as, the, wheel, and, the, sled, u, k, sledge, helped, make, animal, transport, more, efficient, through, the, introduction, of, vehicles, the, first, forms, of, road, transport, involved, animals, such, as, horses, domesticated, in, the, 4th, or, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, oxen, from, about, 8000, bce, or, humans, carrying, goods, over, dirt, tracks, that, often, followed, game, trails, water, transport, including, rowed, and, sailed, vessels, dates, back, to, time, immemorial, and, was, the, only, efficient, way, to, transport, large, quantities, or, over, large, distances, prior, to, the, industrial, revolution, the, first, watercraft, were, canoes, cut, out, from, tree, trunks, early, water, transport, was, accomplished, with, ships, that, were, either, rowed, or, used, the, wind, for, propulsion, or, a, combination, of, the, two, the, importance, of, water, has, led, to, most, cities, that, grew, up, as, sites, for, trading, being, located, on, rivers, or, on, the, sea, shore, often, at, the, intersection, of, two, bodies, of, water, until, the, industrial, revolution, transport, remained, slow, and, costly, and, production, and, consumption, gravitated, as, close, to, each, other, as, feasible, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, 19th, century, saw, several, inventions, fundamentally, change, transport, with, telegraphy, communication, became, instant, and, independent, of, the, transport, of, physical, objects, the, invention, of, the, steam, engine, closely, followed, by, its, application, in, rail, transport, made, land, transport, independent, of, human, or, animal, muscles, both, speed, and, capacity, increased, allowing, specialization, through, manufacturing, being, located, independently, of, natural, resources, the, 19th, century, also, saw, the, development, of, the, steam, ship, which, sped, up, global, transport, with, the, development, of, the, combustion, engine, and, the, automobile, around, 1900, road, transport, became, more, competitive, again, and, mechanical, private, transport, originated, the, first, modern, highways, were, constructed, during, the, 19th, century, with, macadam, later, tarmac, and, concrete, became, the, dominant, paving, materials, in, 1903, the, wright, brothers, demonstrated, the, first, successful, controllable, airplane, and, after, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, aircraft, became, a, fast, way, to, transport, people, and, express, goods, over, long, distances, after, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, the, automobile, and, airlines, took, higher, shares, of, transport, reducing, rail, and, water, to, freight, and, short, haul, passenger, services, scientific, spaceflight, began, in, the, 1950s, with, rapid, growth, until, the, 1970s, when, interest, dwindled, in, the, 1950s, the, introduction, of, containerization, gave, massive, efficiency, gains, in, freight, transport, fostering, globalization, international, air, travel, became, much, more, accessible, in, the, 1960s, with, the, commercialization, of, the, jet, engine, along, with, the, growth, in, automobiles, and, motorways, rail, and, water, transport, declined, in, relative, importance, after, the, introduction, of, the, shinkansen, in, japan, in, 1964, high, speed, rail, in, asia, and, europe, started, attracting, passengers, on, long, haul, routes, away, from, the, airlines, early, in, u, s, history, private, joint, stock, corporations, owned, most, aqueducts, bridges, canals, railroads, roads, and, tunnels, most, such, transport, infrastructure, came, under, government, control, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, culminating, in, the, nationalization, of, inter, city, passenger, rail, service, with, the, establishment, of, amtrak, recently, however, a, movement, to, privatize, roads, and, other, infrastructure, has, gained, some, ground, and, adherents
