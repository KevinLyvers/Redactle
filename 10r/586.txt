an, optical, prism, is, a, transparent, optical, element, with, flat, polished, surfaces, that, are, designed, to, refract, light, at, least, one, surface, must, be, angled, elements, with, two, parallel, surfaces, are, not, prisms, the, most, familiar, type, of, optical, prism, is, the, triangular, prism, which, has, a, triangular, base, and, rectangular, sides, not, all, optical, prisms, are, geometric, prisms, and, not, all, geometric, prisms, would, count, as, an, optical, prism, prisms, can, be, made, from, any, material, that, is, transparent, to, the, wavelengths, for, which, they, are, designed, typical, materials, include, glass, acrylic, and, fluorite, a, dispersive, prism, can, be, used, to, break, white, light, up, into, its, constituent, spectral, colors, the, colors, of, the, rainbow, to, form, a, spectrum, as, described, in, the, following, section, other, types, of, prisms, noted, below, can, be, used, to, reflect, light, or, to, split, light, into, components, with, different, polarizations, dispersive, prisms, are, used, to, break, up, light, into, its, constituent, spectral, colors, because, the, refractive, index, depends, on, wavelength, the, white, light, entering, the, prism, is, a, mixture, of, different, wavelengths, each, of, which, gets, bent, slightly, differently, blue, light, is, slowed, more, than, red, light, and, will, therefore, be, bent, more, than, red, light, spectral, dispersion, is, the, best, known, property, of, optical, prisms, although, not, the, most, frequent, purpose, of, using, optical, prisms, in, practice, reflective, prisms, are, used, to, reflect, light, in, order, to, flip, invert, rotate, deviate, or, displace, the, light, beam, they, are, typically, used, to, erect, the, image, in, binoculars, or, single, lens, reflex, cameras, without, the, prisms, the, image, would, be, upside, down, for, the, user, reflective, prisms, use, total, internal, reflection, to, achieve, near, perfect, reflection, of, light, that, strikes, the, facets, at, a, sufficiently, oblique, angle, prisms, are, usually, made, of, optical, glass, which, combined, with, anti, reflective, coating, of, input, and, output, facets, leads, to, significantly, lower, light, loss, than, metallic, mirrors, various, thin, film, optical, layers, can, be, deposited, on, the, hypotenuse, of, one, right, angled, prism, and, cemented, to, another, prism, to, form, a, beam, splitter, cube, overall, optical, performance, of, such, a, cube, is, determined, by, the, thin, layer, in, comparison, with, a, usual, glass, substrate, the, glass, cube, provides, protection, of, the, thin, film, layer, from, both, sides, and, better, mechanical, stability, the, cube, can, also, eliminate, etalon, effects, back, side, reflection, and, slight, beam, deflection, another, class, is, formed, by, polarizing, prisms, which, use, birefringence, to, split, a, beam, of, light, into, components, of, varying, polarization, in, the, visible, and, uv, regions, they, have, very, low, losses, and, their, extinction, ratio, typically, exceeds, 10, 5, 1, displaystyle, 10, 5, 1, which, is, superior, to, other, types, of, polarizers, they, may, or, may, not, employ, total, internal, reflection, these, are, typically, made, of, a, birefringent, crystalline, material, like, calcite, but, other, materials, like, quartz, and, bbo, may, be, necessary, for, uv, applications, and, others, mgf, 2, yvo, 4, and, tio, 2, will, extend, transmission, farther, into, the, infrared, spectral, range, prisms, made, of, isotropic, materials, like, glass, will, also, alter, polarization, of, light, as, partial, reflection, under, oblique, angles, does, not, maintain, the, amplitude, ratio, nor, phase, of, the, s, and, p, polarized, components, of, the, light, leading, to, general, elliptical, polarization, this, is, generally, an, unwanted, effect, of, dispersive, prisms, in, some, cases, this, can, be, avoided, by, choosing, prism, geometry, which, light, enters, and, exits, under, perpendicular, angle, by, compensation, through, non, planar, light, trajectory, or, by, use, of, p, polarized, light, total, internal, reflection, alters, only, the, mutual, phase, between, s, and, p, polarized, light, under, well, chosen, angle, of, incidence, this, phase, is, close, to, 4, displaystyle, pi, 4, birefringent, crystals, can, be, assembled, in, a, way, that, leads, to, apparent, depolarization, of, the, light, depolarization, would, not, be, observed, for, an, ideal, monochromatic, plane, wave, as, actually, both, devices, turn, reduced, temporal, coherence, or, spatial, coherence, respectively, of, the, beam, into, decoherence, of, its, polarization, components, total, internal, reflection, in, prisms, finds, numerous, uses, through, optics, plasmonics, and, microscopy, in, particular, other, uses, of, prisms, are, based, on, their, beam, deviating, refraction, by, shifting, corrective, lenses, off, axis, images, seen, through, them, can, be, displaced, in, the, same, way, that, a, prism, displaces, images, eye, care, professionals, use, prisms, as, well, as, lenses, off, axis, to, treat, various, orthoptics, problems, prism, spectacles, with, a, single, prism, perform, a, relative, displacement, of, the, two, eyes, thereby, correcting, eso, exo, hyper, or, hypotropia, in, contrast, spectacles, with, prisms, of, equal, power, for, both, eyes, called, yoked, prisms, also, conjugate, prisms, ambient, lenses, or, performance, glasses, shift, the, visual, field, of, both, eyes, to, the, same, extent
