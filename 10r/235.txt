adhesive, also, known, as, glue, cement, mucilage, or, paste, is, any, non, metallic, substance, applied, to, one, or, both, surfaces, of, two, separate, items, that, binds, them, together, and, resists, their, separation, the, use, of, adhesives, offers, certain, advantages, over, other, binding, techniques, such, as, sewing, mechanical, fastenings, and, welding, these, include, the, ability, to, bind, different, materials, together, the, more, efficient, distribution, of, stress, across, a, joint, the, cost, effectiveness, of, an, easily, mechanized, process, and, greater, flexibility, in, design, disadvantages, of, adhesive, use, include, decreased, stability, at, high, temperatures, relative, weakness, in, bonding, large, objects, with, a, small, bonding, surface, area, and, greater, difficulty, in, separating, objects, during, testing, adhesives, are, typically, organized, by, the, method, of, adhesion, followed, by, reactive, or, non, reactive, a, term, which, refers, to, whether, the, adhesive, chemically, reacts, in, order, to, harden, alternatively, they, can, be, organized, either, by, their, starting, physical, phase, or, whether, their, raw, stock, is, of, natural, or, synthetic, origin, adhesives, may, be, found, naturally, or, produced, synthetically, the, earliest, human, use, of, adhesive, like, substances, was, approximately, 200, 000, years, ago, when, neanderthals, produced, tar, from, the, dry, distillation, of, birch, bark, for, use, in, binding, stone, tools, to, wooden, handles, the, first, references, to, adhesives, in, literature, appeared, approximately, 2000, bc, the, greeks, and, romans, made, great, contributions, to, the, development, of, adhesives, in, europe, glue, was, not, widely, used, until, the, period, ad, 1500, 1700, from, then, until, the, 1900s, increases, in, adhesive, use, and, discovery, were, relatively, gradual, only, since, the, 20th, century, has, the, development, of, synthetic, adhesives, accelerated, rapidly, and, innovation, in, the, field, continues, to, the, present, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, adhesive, use, was, discovered, in, central, italy, when, three, stone, implements, were, discovered, with, birch, bark, tar, indications, the, tools, were, dated, to, about, 200, 000, before, present, in, the, middle, paleolithic, it, is, the, earliest, example, of, tar, hafted, stone, tools, an, experimental, archeology, study, published, in, 2019, demonstrated, how, birch, bark, tar, can, be, produced, in, an, easier, more, discoverable, process, it, involves, directly, burning, birch, bark, under, an, overhanging, rock, surface, in, an, open, air, environment, and, collecting, the, tar, that, builds, up, on, the, rock, although, sticky, enough, plant, based, single, component, adhesives, can, be, brittle, and, vulnerable, to, environmental, conditions, the, first, use, of, compound, adhesives, was, discovered, in, sibudu, south, africa, here, 70, 000, year, old, stone, segments, that, were, once, inserted, in, axe, hafts, were, discovered, covered, with, an, adhesive, composed, of, plant, gum, and, red, ochre, natural, iron, oxide, as, adding, ochre, to, plant, gum, produces, a, stronger, product, and, protects, the, gum, from, disintegrating, under, wet, conditions, the, ability, to, produce, stronger, adhesives, allowed, middle, stone, age, humans, to, attach, stone, segments, to, sticks, in, greater, variations, which, led, to, the, development, of, new, tools, a, study, of, material, from, le, moustier, indicates, that, middle, paleolithic, people, possibly, neanderthals, used, glue, made, from, a, mixture, of, ocher, and, bitumen, to, make, hand, grips, for, cutting, and, scraping, stone, tools, more, recent, examples, of, adhesive, use, by, prehistoric, humans, have, been, found, at, the, burial, sites, of, ancient, tribes, archaeologists, studying, the, sites, found, that, approximately, 6, 000, years, ago, the, tribesmen, had, buried, their, dead, together, with, food, found, in, broken, clay, pots, repaired, with, tree, resins, another, investigation, by, archaeologists, uncovered, the, use, of, bituminous, cements, to, fasten, ivory, eyeballs, to, statues, in, babylonian, temples, dating, to, approximately, 4000, bc, in, 2000, a, paper, revealed, the, discovery, of, a, 5, 200, year, old, man, nicknamed, the, tyrolean, iceman, or, tzi, who, was, preserved, in, a, glacier, near, the, austria, italy, border, several, of, his, belongings, were, found, with, him, including, two, arrows, with, flint, arrowheads, and, a, copper, hatchet, each, with, evidence, of, organic, glue, used, to, connect, the, stone, or, metal, parts, to, the, wooden, shafts, the, glue, was, analyzed, as, pitch, which, requires, the, heating, of, tar, during, its, production, the, retrieval, of, this, tar, requires, a, transformation, of, birch, bark, by, means, of, heat, in, a, process, known, as, pyrolysis, the, first, references, to, adhesives, in, literature, appeared, in, approximately, 2000, bc, further, historical, records, of, adhesive, use, are, found, from, the, period, spanning, 1500, 1000, bc, artifacts, from, this, period, include, paintings, depicting, wood, gluing, operations, and, a, casket, made, of, wood, and, glue, in, king, tutankhamun, s, tomb, other, ancient, egyptian, artifacts, employ, animal, glue, for, bonding, or, lamination, such, lamination, of, wood, for, bows, and, furniture, is, thought, to, have, extended, their, life, and, was, accomplished, using, casein, milk, protein, based, glues, the, ancient, egyptians, also, developed, starch, based, pastes, for, the, bonding, of, papyrus, to, clothing, and, a, plaster, of, paris, like, material, made, of, calcined, gypsum, from, ad, 1, to, 500, the, greeks, and, romans, made, great, contributions, to, the, development, of, adhesives, wood, veneering, and, marquetry, were, developed, the, production, of, animal, and, fish, glues, refined, and, other, materials, utilized, egg, based, pastes, were, used, to, bond, gold, leaves, and, incorporated, various, natural, ingredients, such, as, blood, bone, hide, milk, cheese, vegetables, and, grains, the, greeks, began, the, use, of, slaked, lime, as, mortar, while, the, romans, furthered, mortar, development, by, mixing, lime, with, volcanic, ash, and, sand, this, material, known, as, pozzolanic, cement, was, used, in, the, construction, of, the, roman, colosseum, and, pantheon, the, romans, were, also, the, first, people, known, to, have, used, tar, and, beeswax, as, caulk, and, sealant, between, the, wooden, planks, of, their, boats, and, ships, in, central, asia, the, rise, of, the, mongols, in, approximately, ad, 1000, can, be, partially, attributed, to, the, good, range, and, power, of, the, bows, of, genghis, khan, s, hordes, these, bows, were, made, of, a, bamboo, core, with, horn, on, the, belly, facing, towards, the, archer, and, sinew, on, the, back, bound, together, with, animal, glue, in, europe, glue, fell, into, disuse, until, the, period, ad, 1500, 1700, at, this, time, world, renowned, cabinet, and, furniture, makers, such, as, thomas, chippendale, and, duncan, phyfe, began, to, use, adhesives, to, hold, their, products, together, in, 1690, the, first, commercial, glue, plant, was, established, in, the, netherlands, this, plant, produced, glues, from, animal, hides, in, 1750, the, first, british, glue, patent, was, issued, for, fish, glue, the, following, decades, of, the, next, century, witnessed, the, manufacture, of, casein, glues, in, german, and, swiss, factories, in, 1876, the, first, u, s, patent, number, 183, 024, was, issued, to, the, ross, brothers, for, the, production, of, casein, glue, the, first, u, s, postage, stamps, used, starch, based, adhesives, when, issued, in, 1847, the, first, us, patent, number, 61, 991, on, dextrin, a, starch, derivative, adhesive, was, issued, in, 1867, natural, rubber, was, first, used, as, material, for, adhesives, in, 1830, which, marked, the, starting, point, of, the, modern, adhesive, in, 1862, a, british, patent, number, 3288, was, issued, for, the, plating, of, metal, with, brass, by, electrodeposition, to, obtain, a, stronger, bond, to, rubber, the, development, of, the, automobile, and, the, need, for, rubber, shock, mounts, required, stronger, and, more, durable, bonds, of, rubber, and, metal, this, spurred, the, development, of, cyclized, rubber, treated, in, strong, acids, by, 1927, this, process, was, used, to, produce, solvent, based, thermoplastic, rubber, cements, for, metal, to, rubber, bonding, natural, rubber, based, sticky, adhesives, were, first, used, on, a, backing, by, henry, day, us, patent, 3, 965, in, 1845, later, these, kinds, of, adhesives, were, used, in, cloth, backed, surgical, and, electric, tapes, by, 1925, the, pressure, sensitive, tape, industry, was, born, today, sticky, notes, scotch, tape, and, other, tapes, are, examples, of, pressure, sensitive, adhesives, psa, a, key, step, in, the, development, of, synthetic, plastics, was, the, introduction, of, a, thermoset, plastic, known, as, bakelite, phenolic, in, 1910, within, two, years, phenolic, resin, was, applied, to, plywood, as, a, coating, varnish, in, the, early, 1930s, phenolics, gained, importance, as, adhesive, resins, the, 1920s, 1930s, and, 1940s, witnessed, great, advances, in, the, development, and, production, of, new, plastics, and, resins, due, to, the, first, and, second, world, wars, these, advances, greatly, improved, the, development, of, adhesives, by, allowing, the, use, of, newly, developed, materials, that, exhibited, a, variety, of, properties, with, changing, needs, and, ever, evolving, technology, the, development, of, new, synthetic, adhesives, continues, to, the, present, however, due, to, their, low, cost, natural, adhesives, are, still, more, commonly, used, adhesives, are, typically, organized, by, the, method, of, adhesion, these, are, then, organized, into, reactive, and, non, reactive, adhesives, which, refers, to, whether, the, adhesive, chemically, reacts, in, order, to, harden, alternatively, they, can, be, organized, by, whether, the, raw, stock, is, of, natural, or, synthetic, origin, or, by, their, starting, physical, phase, there, are, two, types, of, adhesives, that, harden, by, drying, solvent, based, adhesives, and, polymer, dispersion, adhesives, also, known, as, emulsion, adhesives, solvent, based, adhesives, are, a, mixture, of, ingredients, typically, polymers, dissolved, in, a, solvent, white, glue, contact, adhesives, and, rubber, cements, are, members, of, the, drying, adhesive, family, as, the, solvent, evaporates, the, adhesive, hardens, depending, on, the, chemical, composition, of, the, adhesive, they, will, adhere, to, different, materials, to, greater, or, lesser, degrees, polymer, dispersion, adhesives, are, milky, white, dispersions, often, based, on, polyvinyl, acetate, pvac, they, are, used, extensively, in, the, woodworking, and, packaging, industries, they, are, also, used, with, fabrics, and, fabric, based, components, and, in, engineered, products, such, as, loudspeaker, cones, pressure, sensitive, adhesives, psa, form, a, bond, by, the, application, of, light, pressure, to, bind, the, adhesive, with, the, adherend, they, are, designed, to, have, a, balance, between, flow, and, resistance, to, flow, the, bond, forms, because, the, adhesive, is, soft, enough, to, flow, i, e, wet, to, the, adherend, the, bond, has, strength, because, the, adhesive, is, hard, enough, to, resist, flow, when, stress, is, applied, to, the, bond, once, the, adhesive, and, the, adherend, are, in, close, proximity, molecular, interactions, such, as, van, der, waals, forces, become, involved, in, the, bond, contributing, significantly, to, its, ultimate, strength, psas, are, designed, for, either, permanent, or, removable, applications, examples, of, permanent, applications, include, safety, labels, for, power, equipment, foil, tape, for, hvac, duct, work, automotive, interior, trim, assembly, and, sound, vibration, damping, films, some, high, performance, permanent, psas, exhibit, high, adhesion, values, and, can, support, kilograms, of, weight, per, square, centimeter, of, contact, area, even, at, elevated, temperatures, permanent, psas, may, initially, be, removable, for, example, to, recover, mislabeled, goods, and, build, adhesion, to, a, permanent, bond, after, several, hours, or, days, removable, adhesives, are, designed, to, form, a, temporary, bond, and, ideally, can, be, removed, after, months, or, years, without, leaving, residue, on, the, adherend, removable, adhesives, are, used, in, applications, such, as, surface, protection, films, masking, tapes, bookmark, and, note, papers, barcode, labels, price, marking, labels, promotional, graphics, materials, and, for, skin, contact, wound, care, dressings, ekg, electrodes, athletic, tape, analgesic, and, trans, dermal, drug, patches, etc, some, removable, adhesives, are, designed, to, repeatedly, stick, and, unstick, they, have, low, adhesion, and, generally, cannot, support, much, weight, pressure, sensitive, adhesive, is, used, in, post, it, notes, pressure, sensitive, adhesives, are, manufactured, with, either, a, liquid, carrier, or, in, 100, solid, form, articles, are, made, from, liquid, psas, by, coating, the, adhesive, and, drying, off, the, solvent, or, water, carrier, they, may, be, further, heated, to, initiate, a, cross, linking, reaction, and, increase, molecular, weight, 100, solid, psas, may, be, low, viscosity, polymers, that, are, coated, and, then, reacted, with, radiation, to, increase, molecular, weight, and, form, the, adhesive, or, they, may, be, high, viscosity, materials, that, are, heated, to, reduce, viscosity, enough, to, allow, coating, and, then, cooled, to, their, final, form, major, raw, material, for, psa, s, are, acrylate, based, polymers, contact, adhesives, form, high, shear, resistance, bonds, with, a, rapid, cure, time, they, are, often, applied, in, thin, layers, for, use, with, laminates, such, as, bonding, formica, to, countertops, and, in, footwear, as, in, attaching, outsoles, to, uppers, natural, rubber, and, polychloroprene, neoprene, are, commonly, used, contact, adhesives, both, of, these, elastomers, undergo, strain, crystallization, contact, adhesives, must, be, applied, to, both, surfaces, and, allowed, some, time, to, dry, before, the, two, surfaces, are, pushed, together, some, contact, adhesives, require, as, long, as, 24, hours, to, dry, completely, before, the, surfaces, are, to, be, held, together, once, the, surfaces, are, pushed, together, the, bond, forms, very, quickly, clamps, are, typically, not, needed, due, to, the, rapid, bond, formation, hot, adhesives, also, known, as, hot, melt, adhesives, are, thermoplastics, applied, in, molten, form, in, the, 65, 180, c, range, which, solidify, on, cooling, to, form, strong, bonds, between, a, wide, range, of, materials, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, based, hot, melts, are, particularly, popular, for, crafts, because, of, their, ease, of, use, and, the, wide, range, of, common, materials, they, can, join, a, glue, gun, shown, at, right, is, one, method, of, applying, hot, adhesives, the, glue, gun, melts, the, solid, adhesive, then, allows, the, liquid, to, pass, through, its, barrel, onto, the, material, where, it, solidifies, thermoplastic, glue, may, have, been, invented, around, 1940, by, procter, gamble, as, a, solution, to, the, problem, that, water, based, adhesives, commonly, used, in, packaging, at, that, time, failed, in, humid, climates, causing, packages, to, open, however, water, based, adhesives, are, still, of, strong, interest, as, they, typically, do, not, contain, volatile, solvents, anaerobic, adhesives, cure, when, in, contact, with, metal, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, they, work, well, in, a, close, fitting, space, as, when, used, as, a, thread, locking, fluid, multi, component, adhesives, harden, by, mixing, two, or, more, components, which, chemically, react, this, reaction, causes, polymers, to, cross, link, into, acrylates, urethanes, and, epoxies, see, thermosetting, polymer, there, are, several, commercial, combinations, of, multi, component, adhesives, in, use, in, industry, some, of, these, combinations, are, the, individual, components, of, a, multi, component, adhesive, are, not, adhesive, by, nature, the, individual, components, react, with, each, other, after, being, mixed, and, show, full, adhesion, only, on, curing, the, multi, component, resins, can, be, either, solvent, based, or, solvent, less, the, solvents, present, in, the, adhesives, are, a, medium, for, the, polyester, or, the, polyurethane, resin, the, solvent, is, dried, during, the, curing, process, pre, mixed, and, frozen, adhesives, pmfs, are, adhesives, that, are, mixed, deaerated, packaged, and, frozen, as, it, is, necessary, for, pmfs, to, remain, frozen, before, use, once, they, are, frozen, at, 80, c, they, are, shipped, with, dry, ice, and, are, required, to, be, stored, at, or, below, 40, c, pmf, adhesives, eliminate, mixing, mistakes, by, the, end, user, and, reduce, exposure, of, curing, agents, that, can, contain, irritants, or, toxins, pmfs, were, introduced, commercially, in, the, 1960s, and, are, commonly, used, in, aerospace, and, defense, one, part, adhesives, harden, via, a, chemical, reaction, with, an, external, energy, source, such, as, radiation, heat, and, moisture, ultraviolet, uv, light, curing, adhesives, also, known, as, light, curing, materials, lcm, have, become, popular, within, the, manufacturing, sector, due, to, their, rapid, curing, time, and, strong, bond, strength, light, curing, adhesives, can, cure, in, as, little, as, one, second, and, many, formulations, can, bond, dissimilar, substrates, materials, and, withstand, harsh, temperatures, these, qualities, make, uv, curing, adhesives, essential, to, the, manufacturing, of, items, in, many, industrial, markets, such, as, electronics, telecommunications, medical, aerospace, glass, and, optical, unlike, traditional, adhesives, uv, light, curing, adhesives, not, only, bond, materials, together, but, they, can, also, be, used, to, seal, and, coat, products, they, are, generally, acrylic, based, heat, curing, adhesives, consist, of, a, pre, made, mixture, of, two, or, more, components, when, heat, is, applied, the, components, react, and, cross, link, this, type, of, adhesive, includes, thermoset, epoxies, urethanes, and, polyimides, moisture, curing, adhesives, cure, when, they, react, with, moisture, present, on, the, substrate, surface, or, in, the, air, this, type, of, adhesive, includes, cyanoacrylates, and, urethanes, natural, adhesives, are, made, from, organic, sources, such, as, vegetable, starch, dextrin, natural, resins, or, animals, e, g, the, milk, protein, casein, and, hide, based, animal, glues, these, are, often, referred, to, as, bioadhesives, one, example, is, a, simple, paste, made, by, cooking, flour, in, water, starch, based, adhesives, are, used, in, corrugated, board, and, paper, sack, production, paper, tube, winding, and, wallpaper, adhesives, casein, glue, is, mainly, used, to, adhere, glass, bottle, labels, animal, glues, have, traditionally, been, used, in, bookbinding, wood, joining, and, many, other, areas, but, now, are, largely, replaced, by, synthetic, glues, except, in, specialist, applications, like, the, production, and, repair, of, stringed, instruments, albumen, made, from, the, protein, component, of, blood, has, been, used, in, the, plywood, industry, masonite, a, wood, hardboard, was, originally, bonded, using, natural, wood, lignin, an, organic, polymer, though, most, modern, particle, boards, such, as, mdf, use, synthetic, thermosetting, resins, synthetic, adhesives, are, made, out, of, organic, compounds, many, are, based, on, elastomers, thermoplastics, emulsions, and, thermosets, examples, of, thermosetting, adhesives, are, epoxy, polyurethane, cyanoacrylate, and, acrylic, polymers, the, first, commercially, produced, synthetic, adhesive, was, karlsons, klister, in, the, 1920s, applicators, of, different, adhesives, are, designed, according, to, the, adhesive, being, used, and, the, size, of, the, area, to, which, the, adhesive, will, be, applied, the, adhesive, is, applied, to, either, one, or, both, of, the, materials, being, bonded, the, pieces, are, aligned, and, pressure, is, added, to, aid, in, adhesion, and, rid, the, bond, of, air, bubbles, common, ways, of, applying, an, adhesive, include, brushes, rollers, using, films, or, pellets, spray, guns, and, applicator, guns, e, g, caulk, gun, all, of, these, can, be, used, manually, or, automated, as, part, of, a, machine, for, an, adhesive, to, be, effective, it, must, have, three, main, properties, firstly, it, must, be, able, to, wet, the, base, material, wetting, is, the, ability, of, a, liquid, to, maintain, contact, with, a, solid, surface, it, must, also, increase, in, strength, after, application, and, finally, it, must, be, able, to, transmit, load, between, the, two, surfaces, substrates, being, adhered, adhesion, the, attachment, between, adhesive, and, substrate, may, occur, either, by, mechanical, means, in, which, the, adhesive, works, its, way, into, small, pores, of, the, substrate, or, by, one, of, several, chemical, mechanisms, the, strength, of, adhesion, depends, on, many, factors, including, the, means, by, which, it, occurs, in, some, cases, an, actual, chemical, bond, occurs, between, adhesive, and, substrate, thiolated, polymers, for, example, form, chemical, bonds, with, endogenous, proteins, such, as, mucus, glycoproteins, integrins, or, keratins, via, disulfide, bridges, because, of, their, comparatively, high, adhesive, properties, these, polymers, find, numerous, biomedical, applications, in, others, electrostatic, forces, as, in, static, electricity, hold, the, substances, together, a, third, mechanism, involves, the, van, der, waals, forces, that, develop, between, molecules, a, fourth, means, involves, the, moisture, aided, diffusion, of, the, glue, into, the, substrate, followed, by, hardening, the, quality, of, adhesive, bonding, depends, strongly, on, the, ability, of, the, adhesive, to, efficiently, cover, wet, the, substrate, area, this, happens, when, the, surface, energy, of, the, substrate, is, greater, than, the, surface, energy, of, the, adhesive, however, high, strength, adhesives, have, high, surface, energy, thus, they, bond, poorly, to, low, surface, energy, polymers, or, other, materials, to, solve, this, problem, surface, treatment, can, be, used, to, increase, the, surface, energy, as, a, preparation, step, before, adhesive, bonding, importantly, surface, preparation, provides, a, reproducible, surface, allowing, consistent, bonding, results, the, commonly, used, surface, activation, techniques, include, plasma, activation, flame, treatment, and, wet, chemistry, priming, there, are, several, factors, that, could, contribute, to, the, failure, of, two, adhered, surfaces, sunlight, and, heat, may, weaken, the, adhesive, solvents, can, deteriorate, or, dissolve, adhesive, physical, stresses, may, also, cause, the, separation, of, surfaces, when, subjected, to, loading, debonding, may, occur, at, different, locations, in, the, adhesive, joint, the, major, fracture, types, are, the, following, cohesive, fracture, is, obtained, if, a, crack, propagates, in, the, bulk, polymer, which, constitutes, the, adhesive, in, this, case, the, surfaces, of, both, adherends, after, debonding, will, be, covered, by, fractured, adhesive, the, crack, may, propagate, in, the, center, of, the, layer, or, near, an, interface, for, this, last, case, the, cohesive, fracture, can, be, said, to, be, cohesive, near, the, interface, adhesive, fracture, sometimes, referred, to, as, interfacial, fracture, is, when, debonding, occurs, between, the, adhesive, and, the, adherend, in, most, cases, the, occurrence, of, adhesive, fracture, for, a, given, adhesive, goes, along, with, smaller, fracture, toughness, other, types, of, fracture, include, as, a, general, design, rule, the, material, properties, of, the, object, need, to, be, greater, than, the, forces, anticipated, during, its, use, i, e, geometry, loads, etc, the, engineering, work, will, consist, of, having, a, good, model, to, evaluate, the, function, for, most, adhesive, joints, this, can, be, achieved, using, fracture, mechanics, concepts, such, as, the, stress, concentration, factor, and, the, strain, energy, release, rate, can, be, used, to, predict, failure, in, such, models, the, behavior, of, the, adhesive, layer, itself, is, neglected, and, only, the, adherents, are, considered, failure, will, also, very, much, depend, on, the, opening, mode, of, the, joint, as, the, loads, are, usually, fixed, an, acceptable, design, will, result, from, combination, of, a, material, selection, procedure, and, geometry, modifications, if, possible, in, adhesively, bonded, structures, the, global, geometry, and, loads, are, fixed, by, structural, considerations, and, the, design, procedure, focuses, on, the, material, properties, of, the, adhesive, and, on, local, changes, on, the, geometry, increasing, the, joint, resistance, is, usually, obtained, by, designing, its, geometry, so, that, some, glues, and, adhesives, have, a, limited, shelf, life, shelf, life, is, dependent, on, multiple, factors, the, foremost, of, which, being, temperature, adhesives, may, lose, their, effectiveness, at, high, temperatures, as, well, as, become, increasingly, stiff, other, factors, affecting, shelf, life, include, exposure, to, oxygen, or, water, vapor
