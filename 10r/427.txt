a, toilet, is, a, piece, of, sanitary, hardware, that, collects, human, urine, and, feces, and, sometimes, toilet, paper, usually, for, disposal, flush, toilets, use, water, while, dry, or, non, flush, toilets, do, not, they, can, be, designed, for, a, sitting, position, popular, in, europe, and, north, america, with, a, toilet, seat, with, additional, considerations, for, those, with, disabilities, or, for, a, squatting, posture, more, popular, in, asia, known, as, a, squat, toilet, in, urban, areas, flush, toilets, are, usually, connected, to, a, sewer, system, in, isolated, areas, to, a, septic, tank, the, waste, is, known, as, blackwater, and, the, combined, effluent, including, other, sources, is, sewage, dry, toilets, are, connected, to, a, pit, removable, container, composting, chamber, or, other, storage, and, treatment, device, including, urine, diversion, with, a, urine, diverting, toilet, the, technology, used, for, modern, toilets, varies, toilets, are, commonly, made, of, ceramic, porcelain, concrete, plastic, or, wood, newer, toilet, technologies, include, dual, flushing, low, flushing, toilet, seat, warming, self, cleaning, female, urinals, and, waterless, urinals, japan, is, known, for, its, toilet, technology, airplane, toilets, are, specially, designed, to, operate, in, the, air, the, need, to, maintain, anal, hygiene, post, defecation, is, universally, recognized, and, toilet, paper, often, held, by, a, toilet, roll, holder, which, may, also, be, used, to, wipe, the, vulva, after, urination, is, widely, used, as, well, as, bidets, in, private, homes, depending, on, the, region, and, style, the, toilet, may, exist, in, the, same, bathroom, as, the, sink, bathtub, and, shower, another, option, is, to, have, one, room, for, body, washing, also, called, bathroom, and, a, separate, one, for, the, toilet, and, handwashing, sink, toilet, room, public, toilets, restrooms, consist, of, one, or, more, toilets, and, commonly, single, urinals, or, trough, urinals, which, are, available, for, use, by, the, general, public, products, like, urinal, blocks, and, toilet, blocks, help, maintain, the, smell, and, cleanliness, of, toilets, toilet, seat, covers, are, sometimes, used, portable, toilets, frequently, chemical, porta, johns, may, be, brought, in, for, large, and, temporary, gatherings, historically, sanitation, has, been, a, concern, from, the, earliest, stages, of, human, settlements, however, many, poor, households, in, developing, countries, use, very, basic, and, often, unhygienic, toilets, and, nearly, one, billion, people, have, no, access, to, a, toilet, at, all, they, must, openly, defecate, and, urinate, these, issues, can, lead, to, the, spread, of, diseases, transmitted, via, the, fecal, oral, route, or, the, transmission, of, waterborne, diseases, such, as, cholera, and, dysentery, therefore, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 6, wants, to, achieve, access, to, adequate, and, equitable, sanitation, and, hygiene, for, all, and, end, open, defecation, the, number, of, different, types, of, toilets, used, worldwide, is, large, but, can, be, grouped, by, toilets, can, be, designed, to, be, used, either, in, a, sitting, or, in, a, squatting, posture, each, type, has, its, benefits, the, sitting, toilet, however, is, essential, for, those, who, are, movement, impaired, sitting, toilets, are, often, referred, to, as, western, style, toilets, sitting, toilets, are, more, convenient, than, squat, toilets, for, people, with, disabilities, and, the, elderly, people, use, different, toilet, types, based, on, the, country, that, they, are, in, in, developing, countries, access, to, toilets, is, also, related, to, people, s, socio, economic, status, poor, people, in, low, income, countries, often, have, no, toilets, at, all, and, resort, to, open, defecation, instead, this, is, part, of, the, sanitation, crisis, which, international, initiatives, such, as, world, toilet, day, draw, attention, to, a, typical, flush, toilet, is, a, ceramic, bowl, pan, connected, on, the, up, side, to, a, cistern, tank, that, enables, rapid, filling, with, water, and, on, the, down, side, to, a, drain, pipe, that, removes, the, effluent, when, a, toilet, is, flushed, the, sewage, should, flow, into, a, septic, tank, or, into, a, system, connected, to, a, sewage, treatment, plant, however, in, many, developing, countries, this, treatment, step, does, not, take, place, the, water, in, the, toilet, bowl, is, connected, to, a, pipe, shaped, like, an, upside, down, u, one, side, of, the, u, channel, is, arranged, as, a, siphon, tube, longer, than, the, water, in, the, bowl, is, high, the, siphon, tube, connects, to, the, drain, the, bottom, of, the, drain, pipe, limits, the, height, of, the, water, in, the, bowl, before, it, flows, down, the, drain, the, water, in, the, bowl, acts, as, a, barrier, to, sewer, gas, entering, the, building, sewer, gas, escapes, through, a, vent, pipe, attached, to, the, sewer, line, the, amount, of, water, used, by, conventional, flush, toilets, usually, makes, up, a, significant, portion, of, personal, daily, water, usage, however, modern, low, flush, toilet, designs, allow, the, use, of, much, less, water, per, flush, dual, flush, toilets, allow, the, user, to, select, between, a, flush, for, urine, or, feces, saving, a, significant, amount, of, water, over, conventional, units, one, type, of, dual, flush, system, allows, the, flush, handle, to, be, pushed, up, for, one, kind, of, flush, and, down, for, the, other, whereas, another, design, is, to, have, two, buttons, one, for, urination, and, the, other, for, defecation, in, some, places, users, are, encouraged, not, to, flush, after, urination, flushing, toilets, can, be, plumbed, to, use, greywater, water, that, was, previously, used, for, washing, dishes, laundry, and, bathing, rather, than, potable, water, drinking, water, some, modern, toilets, pressurize, the, water, in, the, tank, which, initiates, flushing, action, with, less, water, usage, another, variant, is, the, pour, flush, toilet, this, type, of, flush, toilet, has, no, cistern, but, is, flushed, manually, with, a, few, liters, of, a, small, bucket, the, flushing, can, use, as, little, as, 2, 3, litres, 0, 44, 0, 66, imp, gal, 0, 53, 0, 79, us, gal, this, type, of, toilet, is, common, in, many, asian, countries, the, toilet, can, be, connected, to, one, or, two, pits, in, which, case, it, is, called, a, pour, flush, pit, latrine, or, a, twin, pit, pour, flush, to, pit, latrine, it, can, also, be, connected, to, a, septic, tank, flush, toilets, on, ships, are, typically, flushed, with, seawater, twin, pit, latrines, use, two, pits, used, alternatively, when, one, pit, gets, full, over, a, few, months, or, years, the, pits, are, of, an, adequate, size, to, accommodate, a, volume, of, waste, generated, over, one, or, two, years, this, allows, the, contents, of, the, full, pit, enough, time, to, transform, into, a, partially, sanitized, soil, like, material, that, can, be, manually, excavated, there, is, a, risk, of, groundwater, pollution, when, pits, are, located, in, areas, with, a, high, or, variable, water, table, and, or, fissures, or, cracks, in, the, bedrock, a, vacuum, toilet, is, a, flush, toilet, that, is, connected, to, a, vacuum, sewer, system, and, removes, waste, by, suction, they, may, use, very, little, water, less, than, a, quarter, of, a, liter, per, flush, or, none, as, in, waterless, urinals, some, flush, with, coloured, disinfectant, solution, rather, than, with, water, they, may, be, used, to, separate, blackwater, and, greywater, and, process, them, separately, for, instance, the, fairly, dry, blackwater, can, be, used, for, biogas, production, or, in, a, composting, toilet, passenger, train, toilets, aircraft, lavatories, bus, toilets, and, ships, with, plumbing, often, use, vacuum, toilets, the, lower, water, usage, saves, weight, and, avoids, water, slopping, out, of, the, toilet, bowl, in, motion, aboard, vehicles, a, portable, collection, chamber, is, used, if, it, is, filled, by, positive, pressure, from, an, intermediate, vacuum, chamber, it, need, not, be, kept, under, vacuum, a, floating, toilet, is, essentially, a, toilet, on, a, platform, built, above, or, floating, on, the, water, instead, of, excreta, going, into, the, ground, they, are, collected, in, a, tank, or, barrel, to, reduce, the, amount, of, excreta, that, needs, to, hauled, to, shore, many, use, urine, diversion, the, floating, toilet, was, developed, for, residents, without, quick, access, to, land, or, connection, to, a, sewer, systems, it, is, also, used, in, areas, subjected, to, prolonged, flooding, the, need, for, this, type, of, toilet, is, high, in, areas, like, cambodia, a, vault, toilet, is, a, non, flush, toilet, with, a, sealed, container, or, vault, buried, in, the, ground, to, receive, the, excreta, all, of, which, is, contained, underground, until, it, is, removed, by, pumping, a, vault, toilet, is, distinguished, from, a, pit, latrine, because, the, waste, accumulates, in, the, vault, instead, of, seeping, into, the, underlying, soil, a, chemical, toilet, collects, human, excreta, in, a, holding, tank, and, uses, chemicals, to, minimize, odors, they, do, not, require, a, connection, to, a, water, supply, and, are, used, in, a, variety, of, situations, these, toilets, are, usually, but, not, always, self, contained, and, movable, a, chemical, toilet, is, structured, around, a, relatively, small, tank, which, requires, frequent, emptying, it, is, not, connected, to, a, hole, in, the, ground, like, a, pit, latrine, nor, to, a, septic, tank, nor, is, it, plumbed, into, a, municipal, system, leading, to, a, sewage, treatment, plant, when, the, tank, is, emptied, the, contents, are, usually, pumped, into, a, sanitary, sewer, or, directly, to, a, treatment, plant, the, pig, toilet, which, consists, of, a, toilet, linked, to, a, pigsty, by, a, chute, is, still, in, use, to, a, limited, extent, it, was, common, in, rural, china, and, was, known, in, japan, korea, and, india, the, fish, pond, toilet, depends, on, the, same, principle, of, livestock, often, carp, eating, human, excreta, directly, there, are, cultural, differences, in, socially, accepted, and, preferred, voiding, positions, for, urination, around, the, world, in, the, middle, east, and, asia, the, squatting, position, is, more, prevalent, while, in, the, western, world, the, standing, and, sitting, position, are, more, common, in, the, western, world, the, most, common, method, of, cleaning, the, anal, area, after, defecation, is, by, toilet, paper, or, sometimes, by, using, a, bidet, in, many, muslim, countries, the, facilities, are, designed, to, enable, people, to, follow, islamic, toilet, etiquette, qa, al, jah, for, example, a, bidet, shower, may, be, plumbed, in, the, left, hand, is, used, for, cleansing, for, which, reason, that, hand, is, considered, impolite, or, polluted, in, many, asian, countries, the, use, of, water, in, many, christian, countries, is, due, in, part, to, the, biblical, toilet, etiquette, which, encourages, washing, after, all, instances, of, defecation, the, bidet, is, common, in, predominantly, catholic, countries, where, water, is, considered, essential, for, anal, cleansing, and, in, some, traditionally, orthodox, and, lutheran, countries, such, as, greece, and, finland, respectively, where, bidet, showers, are, common, there, are, toilets, on, the, market, with, seats, having, integrated, spray, mechanisms, for, anal, and, genital, water, sprays, see, for, example, toilets, in, japan, this, can, be, useful, for, the, elderly, or, people, with, disabilities, an, accessible, toilet, is, designed, to, accommodate, people, with, physical, disabilities, such, as, age, related, limited, mobility, or, inability, to, walk, due, to, impairments, additional, measures, to, add, toilet, accessibility, are, providing, more, space, and, grab, bars, to, ease, transfer, to, and, from, the, toilet, seat, including, enough, room, for, a, caregiver, if, necessary, in, prisons, inmates, may, utilize, toilets, and, the, associated, plumbing, to, communicate, messages, and, pass, products, the, acoustic, properties, of, communicating, through, the, toilet, bowl, known, as, toilet, talk, potty, talk, toilet, telephone, is, influenced, by, flush, patterns, and, bowl, water, volumes, prisoners, may, also, send, binary, signals, by, ringing, the, sewage, or, water, pipes, toilet, talk, enables, communication, for, those, in, solitary, confinement, toilets, have, been, subject, to, wiretaps, to, this, day, 1, billion, people, in, developing, countries, have, no, toilets, in, their, homes, and, are, resorting, to, open, defecation, instead, therefore, it, is, one, of, the, targets, of, sustainable, development, goal, 6, to, provide, toilets, sanitation, services, to, everyone, by, 2030, toilets, are, one, important, element, of, a, sanitation, system, although, other, elements, are, also, needed, transport, treatment, disposal, or, reuse, diseases, including, cholera, which, still, affects, some, 3, million, people, each, year, can, be, largely, prevented, when, effective, sanitation, and, water, treatment, prevents, fecal, matter, from, contaminating, waterways, groundwater, and, drinking, water, supplies, the, fourth, millennium, bc, would, witness, the, invention, of, clay, pipes, sewers, and, toilets, in, mesopotamia, with, the, city, of, uruk, today, exhibiting, the, earliest, known, internal, pit, toilet, from, c, 3200, bc, the, neolithic, village, of, skara, brae, contains, examples, c, 3000, bc, of, internal, small, rooms, over, a, communal, drain, rather, than, pit, the, indus, valley, civilisation, in, northwestern, india, and, pakistan, was, home, to, the, world, s, first, known, urban, sanitation, systems, in, mohenjo, daro, c, 2800, bc, toilets, were, built, into, the, outer, walls, of, homes, these, toilets, had, vertical, chutes, via, which, waste, was, disposed, of, into, cesspits, or, street, drains, in, the, indus, city, of, lothal, c, 2350, bc, houses, belonging, to, the, upper, class, had, private, toilets, connected, to, a, covered, sewer, network, constructed, of, brickwork, held, together, with, a, gypsum, based, mortar, that, emptied, either, into, the, surrounding, water, bodies, or, alternatively, into, cesspits, the, latter, of, which, were, regularly, emptied, and, cleaned, other, very, early, toilets, that, used, flowing, water, to, remove, the, waste, are, found, at, skara, brae, in, orkney, scotland, which, was, occupied, from, about, 3100, bc, until, 2500, bc, some, of, the, houses, there, have, a, drain, running, directly, beneath, them, and, some, of, these, had, a, cubicle, over, the, drain, around, the, 18th, century, bc, toilets, started, to, appear, in, minoan, crete, pharaonic, egypt, and, ancient, persia, in, 2012, archaeologists, found, what, is, believed, to, be, southeast, asia, s, earliest, latrine, during, the, excavation, of, a, neolithic, village, in, the, r, ch, n, i, archaeological, site, southern, vietnam, the, toilet, dating, back, 1500, bc, yielded, important, clues, about, early, southeast, asian, society, more, than, 30, coprolites, containing, fish, and, shattered, animal, bones, provided, information, on, the, diet, of, humans, and, dogs, and, on, the, types, of, parasites, each, had, to, contend, with, in, sri, lanka, the, techniques, of, the, construction, of, toilets, and, lavatories, developed, over, several, stages, a, highly, developed, stage, in, this, process, is, discernible, in, the, constructions, at, the, abhayagiri, complex, in, anuradhapura, where, toilets, and, baths, dating, back, to, 2nd, century, bc, to, 3rd, century, ce, are, known, later, forms, of, toilets, from, 5th, century, ce, to, 13th, century, ce, in, polonnaruwa, and, anuradhapura, had, elaborate, decorative, motifs, carved, around, the, toilets, several, types, of, toilets, were, developed, these, include, lavatories, with, ring, well, pits, underground, terracotta, pipes, that, lead, to, septic, pits, urinary, pits, with, large, bottomless, clay, pots, of, decreasing, size, placed, one, above, the, other, these, pots, under, urinals, contained, sand, lime, and, charcoal, through, which, urine, filtered, down, to, the, earth, in, a, somewhat, purified, form, in, roman, civilization, latrines, using, flowing, water, were, sometimes, part, of, public, bath, houses, roman, latrines, like, the, ones, pictured, here, are, commonly, thought, to, have, been, used, in, the, sitting, position, the, roman, toilets, were, probably, elevated, to, raise, them, above, open, sewers, which, were, periodically, flushed, with, flowing, water, rather, than, elevated, for, sitting, romans, and, greeks, also, used, chamber, pots, which, they, brought, to, meals, and, drinking, sessions, johan, j, mattelaer, said, plinius, has, described, how, there, were, large, receptacles, in, the, streets, of, cities, such, as, rome, and, pompeii, into, which, chamber, pots, of, urine, were, emptied, the, urine, was, then, collected, by, fullers, fulling, was, a, vital, step, in, textile, manufacture, the, han, dynasty, in, china, two, thousand, years, ago, used, pig, toilets, garderobes, were, toilets, used, in, the, post, classical, history, most, commonly, found, in, upper, class, dwellings, essentially, they, were, flat, pieces, of, wood, or, stone, spanning, from, one, wall, to, the, other, with, one, or, more, holes, to, sit, on, these, were, above, chutes, or, pipes, that, discharged, outside, the, castle, or, manor, house, garderobes, would, be, placed, in, areas, away, from, bedrooms, because, of, the, smell, and, also, near, kitchens, or, fireplaces, to, keep, their, enclosures, warm, the, other, main, way, of, handling, toilet, needs, was, the, chamber, pot, a, receptacle, usually, of, ceramic, or, metal, into, which, one, would, excrete, waste, this, method, was, used, for, hundreds, of, years, shapes, sizes, and, decorative, variations, changed, throughout, the, centuries, chamber, pots, were, in, common, use, in, europe, from, ancient, times, even, being, taken, to, the, middle, east, by, medieval, pilgrims, by, the, early, modern, era, chamber, pots, were, frequently, made, of, china, or, copper, and, could, include, elaborate, decoration, they, were, emptied, into, the, gutter, of, the, street, nearest, to, the, home, in, pre, modern, denmark, people, generally, defecated, on, farmland, or, other, places, where, the, human, waste, could, be, collected, as, fertilizer, the, old, norse, language, had, several, terms, for, referring, to, outhouses, including, gar, h, s, yard, house, n, n, a, h, s, house, of, rest, and, annat, h, s, the, other, house, in, general, toilets, were, functionally, non, existent, in, rural, denmark, until, the, 18th, century, by, the, 16th, century, cesspits, and, cesspools, were, increasingly, dug, into, the, ground, near, houses, in, europe, as, a, means, of, collecting, waste, as, urban, populations, grew, and, street, gutters, became, blocked, with, the, larger, volume, of, human, waste, rain, was, no, longer, sufficient, to, wash, away, waste, from, the, gutters, a, pipe, connected, the, latrine, to, the, cesspool, and, sometimes, a, small, amount, of, water, washed, waste, through, cesspools, were, cleaned, out, by, tradesmen, known, in, english, as, gong, farmers, who, pumped, out, liquid, waste, then, shovelled, out, the, solid, waste, and, collected, it, during, the, night, this, solid, waste, euphemistically, known, as, nightsoil, was, sold, as, fertilizer, for, agricultural, production, similarly, to, the, closing, the, loop, approach, of, ecological, sanitation, in, the, early, 19th, century, public, officials, and, public, hygiene, experts, studied, and, debated, sanitation, for, several, decades, the, construction, of, an, underground, network, of, pipes, to, carry, away, solid, and, liquid, waste, was, only, begun, in, the, mid, 19th, century, gradually, replacing, the, cesspool, system, although, cesspools, were, still, in, use, in, some, parts, of, paris, into, the, 20th, century, even, london, at, that, time, the, world, s, largest, city, did, not, require, indoor, toilets, in, its, building, codes, until, after, the, first, world, war, the, water, closet, with, its, origins, in, tudor, times, started, to, assume, its, currently, known, form, with, an, overhead, cistern, s, bends, soil, pipes, and, valves, around, 1770, this, was, the, work, of, alexander, cumming, and, joseph, bramah, water, closets, only, started, to, be, moved, from, outside, to, inside, of, the, home, around, 1850, the, integral, water, closet, started, to, be, built, into, middle, class, homes, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, firstly, on, the, principal, bedroom, floor, and, in, larger, houses, in, the, maids, accommodation, and, by, 1900, a, further, one, in, the, hallway, a, toilet, would, also, be, placed, outside, the, back, door, of, the, kitchen, for, use, by, gardeners, and, other, outside, staff, such, as, those, working, with, the, horses, the, speed, of, introduction, was, varied, so, that, in, 1906, the, predominantly, working, class, town, of, rochdale, had, 750, water, closets, for, a, population, of, 10, 000, the, working, class, home, had, transitioned, from, the, rural, cottage, to, the, urban, back, to, back, terraces, with, external, rows, of, privies, to, the, through, terraced, houses, of, the, 1880, with, their, sculleries, and, individual, external, wc, it, was, the, tudor, walters, report, of, 1918, that, recommended, that, semi, skilled, workers, should, be, housed, in, suburban, cottages, with, kitchens, and, internal, wc, as, recommended, floor, standards, waxed, and, waned, in, the, building, standards, and, codes, the, bathroom, with, a, water, closet, and, later, the, low, level, suite, became, more, prominent, in, the, home, before, the, introduction, of, indoor, toilets, it, was, common, to, use, the, chamber, pot, under, one, s, bed, at, night, and, then, to, dispose, of, its, contents, in, the, morning, during, the, victorian, era, british, housemaids, collected, all, of, the, household, s, chamber, pots, and, carried, them, to, a, room, known, as, the, housemaids, cupboard, this, room, contained, a, slop, sink, made, of, wood, with, a, lead, lining, to, prevent, chipping, china, chamber, pots, for, washing, the, bedroom, ware, or, chamber, utensils, once, running, water, and, flush, toilets, were, plumbed, into, british, houses, servants, were, sometimes, given, their, own, lavatory, downstairs, separate, from, the, family, lavatory, the, practice, of, emptying, one, s, own, chamber, pot, known, as, slopping, out, continued, in, british, prisons, until, as, recently, as, 2014, and, was, still, in, use, in, 85, cells, in, ireland, in, july, 2017, with, rare, exceptions, chamber, pots, are, no, longer, used, modern, related, implements, are, bedpans, and, commodes, used, in, hospitals, and, the, homes, of, invalids, long, established, sanitary, wear, manufacturers, in, the, united, kingdom, include, adamsez, founded, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, in, 1880, by, m, j, and, s, h, adams, and, twyfords, founded, in, hanley, stoke, on, trent, in, 1849, by, thomas, twyford, and, his, son, thomas, william, twyford, before, the, widespread, adoption, of, the, flush, toilet, there, were, inventors, scientists, and, public, health, officials, who, supported, the, use, of, dry, earth, closets, nowadays, known, either, as, dry, toilets, or, composting, toilets, although, a, precursor, to, the, flush, toilet, system, which, is, widely, used, nowadays, was, designed, in, 1596, by, john, harington, such, systems, did, not, come, into, widespread, use, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, related, advances, in, technology, the, flush, toilet, began, to, emerge, into, its, modern, form, a, crucial, advance, in, plumbing, was, the, s, trap, invented, by, the, scottish, mechanic, alexander, cummings, in, 1775, and, still, in, use, today, this, device, uses, the, standing, water, to, seal, the, outlet, of, the, bowl, preventing, the, escape, of, foul, air, from, the, sewer, it, was, only, in, the, mid, 19th, century, with, growing, levels, of, urbanisation, and, industrial, prosperity, that, the, flush, toilet, became, a, widely, used, and, marketed, invention, this, period, coincided, with, the, dramatic, growth, in, the, sewage, system, especially, in, london, which, made, the, flush, toilet, particularly, attractive, for, health, and, sanitation, reasons, flush, toilets, were, also, known, as, water, closets, as, opposed, to, the, earth, closets, described, above, wcs, first, appeared, in, britain, in, the, 1880s, and, soon, spread, to, continental, europe, in, america, the, chain, pull, indoor, toilet, was, introduced, in, the, homes, of, the, wealthy, and, in, hotels, in, the, 1890s, william, elvis, sloan, invented, the, flushometer, in, 1906, which, used, pressurized, water, directly, from, the, supply, line, for, faster, recycle, time, between, flushes, high, tech, toilets, which, can, be, found, in, countries, like, japan, include, features, such, as, automatic, flushing, mechanisms, water, jets, or, bottom, washers, blow, dryers, or, artificial, flush, sounds, to, mask, noises, others, include, medical,
