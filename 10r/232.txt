a, water, tower, is, an, elevated, structure, supporting, a, water, tank, constructed, at, a, height, sufficient, to, pressurize, a, distribution, system, for, potable, water, and, to, provide, emergency, storage, for, fire, protection, water, towers, often, operate, in, conjunction, with, underground, or, surface, service, reservoirs, which, store, treated, water, close, to, where, it, will, be, used, other, types, of, water, towers, may, only, store, raw, non, potable, water, for, fire, protection, or, industrial, purposes, and, may, not, necessarily, be, connected, to, a, public, water, supply, water, towers, are, able, to, supply, water, even, during, power, outages, because, they, rely, on, hydrostatic, pressure, produced, by, elevation, of, water, due, to, gravity, to, push, the, water, into, domestic, and, industrial, water, distribution, systems, however, they, cannot, supply, the, water, for, a, long, time, without, power, because, a, pump, is, typically, required, to, refill, the, tower, a, water, tower, also, serves, as, a, reservoir, to, help, with, water, needs, during, peak, usage, times, the, water, level, in, the, tower, typically, falls, during, the, peak, usage, hours, of, the, day, and, then, a, pump, fills, it, back, up, during, the, night, this, process, also, keeps, the, water, from, freezing, in, cold, weather, since, the, tower, is, constantly, being, drained, and, refilled, although, the, use, of, elevated, water, storage, tanks, has, existed, since, ancient, times, in, various, forms, the, modern, use, of, water, towers, for, pressurized, public, water, systems, developed, during, the, mid, 19th, century, as, steam, pumping, became, more, common, and, better, pipes, that, could, handle, higher, pressures, were, developed, in, the, united, kingdom, standpipes, consisted, of, tall, exposed, n, shaped, pipes, used, for, pressure, relief, and, to, provide, a, fixed, elevation, for, steam, driven, pumping, engines, which, tended, to, produce, a, pulsing, flow, while, the, pressurized, water, distribution, system, required, constant, pressure, standpipes, also, provided, a, convenient, fixed, location, to, measure, flow, rates, designers, typically, enclosed, the, riser, pipes, in, decorative, masonry, or, wooden, structures, by, the, late, 19th, century, standpipes, grew, to, include, storage, tanks, to, meet, the, ever, increasing, demands, of, growing, cities, many, early, water, towers, are, now, considered, historically, significant, and, have, been, included, in, various, heritage, listings, around, the, world, some, are, converted, to, apartments, or, exclusive, penthouses, in, certain, areas, such, as, new, york, city, in, the, united, states, smaller, water, towers, are, constructed, for, individual, buildings, in, california, and, some, other, states, domestic, water, towers, enclosed, by, siding, tankhouses, were, once, built, 1850s, 1930s, to, supply, individual, homes, windmills, pumped, water, from, hand, dug, wells, up, into, the, tank, in, new, york, water, towers, were, used, to, supply, water, stops, for, steam, locomotives, on, railroad, lines, early, steam, locomotives, required, water, stops, every, 7, to, 10, miles, 11, to, 16, km, a, variety, of, materials, can, be, used, to, construct, a, typical, water, tower, steel, and, reinforced, or, prestressed, concrete, are, most, often, used, with, wood, fiberglass, or, brick, also, in, use, incorporating, an, interior, coating, to, protect, the, water, from, any, effects, from, the, lining, material, the, reservoir, in, the, tower, may, be, spherical, cylindrical, or, an, ellipsoid, with, a, minimum, height, of, approximately, 6, metres, 20, ft, and, a, minimum, of, 4, m, 13, ft, in, diameter, a, standard, water, tower, typically, has, a, height, of, approximately, 40, m, 130, ft, pressurization, occurs, through, the, hydrostatic, pressure, of, the, elevation, of, water, for, every, 102, millimetres, 4, 016, in, of, elevation, it, produces, 1, kilopascal, 0, 145, psi, of, pressure, 30, m, 98, 43, ft, of, elevation, produces, roughly, 300, kpa, 43, 511, psi, which, is, enough, pressure, to, operate, and, provide, for, most, domestic, water, pressure, and, distribution, system, requirements, the, height, of, the, tower, provides, the, pressure, for, the, water, supply, system, and, it, may, be, supplemented, with, a, pump, the, volume, of, the, reservoir, and, diameter, of, the, piping, provide, and, sustain, flow, rate, however, relying, on, a, pump, to, provide, pressure, is, expensive, to, keep, up, with, varying, demand, the, pump, would, have, to, be, sized, to, meet, peak, demands, during, periods, of, low, demand, jockey, pumps, are, used, to, meet, these, lower, water, flow, requirements, the, water, tower, reduces, the, need, for, electrical, consumption, of, cycling, pumps, and, thus, the, need, for, an, expensive, pump, control, system, as, this, system, would, have, to, be, sized, sufficiently, to, give, the, same, pressure, at, high, flow, rates, very, high, volumes, and, flow, rates, are, needed, when, fighting, fires, with, a, water, tower, present, pumps, can, be, sized, for, average, demand, not, peak, demand, the, water, tower, can, provide, water, pressure, during, the, day, and, pumps, will, refill, the, water, tower, when, demands, are, lower, using, wireless, sensor, networks, to, monitor, water, levels, inside, the, tower, allows, municipalities, to, automatically, monitor, and, control, pumps, without, installing, and, maintaining, expensive, data, cables, the, adjacent, image, shows, three, architectural, approaches, to, incorporating, these, tanks, in, the, design, of, a, building, one, on, east, 57th, street, in, new, york, city, from, left, to, right, a, fully, enclosed, and, ornately, decorated, brick, structure, a, simple, unadorned, roofless, brick, structure, hiding, most, of, the, tank, but, revealing, the, top, of, the, tank, and, a, simple, utilitarian, structure, that, makes, no, effort, to, hide, the, tanks, or, otherwise, incorporate, them, into, the, design, of, the, building, the, technology, dates, to, at, least, the, 19th, century, and, for, a, long, time, new, york, city, required, that, all, buildings, higher, than, six, stories, be, equipped, with, a, rooftop, water, tower, two, companies, in, new, york, build, water, towers, both, of, which, are, family, businesses, in, operation, since, the, 19th, century, the, original, water, tower, builders, were, barrel, makers, who, expanded, their, craft, to, meet, a, modern, need, as, buildings, in, the, city, grew, taller, in, height, even, today, no, sealant, is, used, to, hold, the, water, in, the, wooden, walls, of, the, water, tower, are, held, together, with, steel, cables, or, straps, but, water, leaks, through, the, gaps, when, first, filled, as, the, water, saturates, the, wood, it, swells, the, gaps, close, and, become, impermeable, the, rooftop, water, towers, store, 250, 000, to, 50, 000, litres, 55, 000, to, 11, 000, imp, gal, 66, 000, to, 13, 000, us, gal, of, water, until, it, is, needed, in, the, building, below, the, upper, portion, of, water, is, skimmed, off, the, top, for, everyday, use, while, the, water, in, the, bottom, of, the, tower, is, held, in, reserve, to, fight, fire, when, the, water, drops, below, a, certain, level, a, pressure, switch, level, switch, or, float, valve, will, activate, a, pump, or, open, a, public, water, line, to, refill, the, water, tower, architects, and, builders, have, taken, varied, approaches, to, incorporating, water, towers, into, the, design, of, their, buildings, on, many, large, commercial, buildings, water, towers, are, completely, hidden, behind, an, extension, of, the, facade, of, the, building, for, cosmetic, reasons, apartment, buildings, often, enclose, their, tanks, in, rooftop, structures, either, simple, unadorned, rooftop, boxes, or, ornately, decorated, structures, intended, to, enhance, the, visual, appeal, of, the, building, many, buildings, however, leave, their, water, towers, in, plain, view, atop, utilitarian, framework, structures, water, towers, are, common, in, india, where, the, electricity, supply, is, erratic, in, most, places, if, the, pumps, fail, such, as, during, a, power, outage, then, water, pressure, will, be, lost, causing, potential, public, health, concerns, many, u, s, states, require, a, boil, water, advisory, to, be, issued, if, water, pressure, drops, below, 20, pounds, per, square, inch, 140, kpa, this, advisory, presumes, that, the, lower, pressure, might, allow, pathogens, to, enter, the, system, some, have, been, converted, to, serve, modern, purposes, as, for, example, the, wie, a, ci, nie, wroc, aw, water, tower, in, wroc, aw, poland, which, is, today, a, restaurant, complex, others, have, been, converted, to, residential, use, historically, railroads, that, used, steam, locomotives, required, a, means, of, replenishing, the, locomotive, s, tenders, water, towers, were, common, along, the, railroad, the, tenders, were, usually, replenished, by, water, cranes, which, were, fed, by, a, water, tower, some, water, towers, are, also, used, as, observation, towers, and, some, restaurants, such, as, the, goldbergturm, in, sindelfingen, germany, or, the, second, of, the, three, kuwait, towers, in, the, state, of, kuwait, it, is, also, common, to, use, water, towers, as, the, location, of, transmission, mechanisms, in, the, uhf, range, with, small, power, for, instance, for, closed, rural, broadcasting, service, amateur, radio, or, cellular, telephone, service, in, hilly, regions, local, topography, can, be, substituted, for, structures, to, elevate, the, tanks, these, tanks, are, often, nothing, more, than, concrete, cisterns, terraced, into, the, sides, of, local, hills, or, mountains, but, function, identically, to, the, traditional, water, tower, the, tops, of, these, tanks, can, be, landscaped, or, used, as, park, space, if, desired, the, chicago, bridge, and, iron, company, has, built, many, of, the, water, spheres, and, spheroids, found, in, the, united, states, the, website, world, s, tallest, water, sphere, describes, the, distinction, between, a, water, sphere, and, water, spheroid, thus, a, water, sphere, is, a, type, of, water, tower, that, has, a, large, sphere, at, the, top, of, its, post, the, sphere, looks, like, a, golf, ball, sitting, on, a, tee, or, a, round, lollipop, a, cross, section, of, a, sphere, in, any, direction, east, west, north, south, or, top, bottom, is, a, perfect, circle, a, water, spheroid, looks, like, a, water, sphere, but, the, top, is, wider, than, it, is, tall, a, spheroid, looks, like, a, round, pillow, that, is, somewhat, flattened, a, cross, section, of, a, spheroid, in, two, directions, east, west, or, north, south, is, an, ellipse, but, in, only, one, direction, top, bottom, is, it, a, perfect, circle, both, spheres, and, spheroids, are, special, case, ellipsoids, spheres, have, symmetry, in, 3, directions, spheroids, have, symmetry, in, 2, directions, scalene, ellipsoids, have, 3, unequal, length, axes, and, three, unequal, cross, sections, the, union, watersphere, is, a, water, tower, topped, with, a, sphere, shaped, water, tank, in, union, new, jersey, and, characterized, as, the, world, s, tallest, water, sphere, a, star, ledger, article, suggested, a, water, tower, in, erwin, north, carolina, completed, in, early, 2012, 219, 75, ft, 66, 98, m, tall, and, holding, 500, 000, us, gallons, 1, 900, m, 3, had, become, the, world, s, tallest, water, sphere, however, photographs, of, the, erwin, water, tower, revealed, the, new, tower, to, be, a, water, spheroid, the, water, tower, in, braman, oklahoma, built, by, the, kaw, nation, and, completed, in, 2010, is, 220, 6, ft, 67, 2, m, tall, and, can, hold, 350, 000, us, gallons, 1, 300, m, 3, slightly, taller, than, the, union, watersphere, it, is, also, a, spheroid, another, tower, in, oklahoma, built, in, 1986, and, billed, as, the, largest, water, tower, in, the, country, is, 218, ft, 66, m, tall, can, hold, 500, 000, us, gallons, 1, 900, m, 3, and, is, located, in, edmond, the, earthoid, a, perfectly, spherical, tank, located, in, germantown, maryland, is, 100, ft, 30, m, tall, and, holds, 2, 000, 000, us, gallons, 7, 600, m, 3, of, water, the, name, is, taken, from, it, being, painted, to, resemble, a, globe, of, the, world, the, golf, ball, shaped, tank, of, the, water, tower, at, gonzales, california, is, supported, by, three, tubular, legs, and, reaches, about, 125, ft, 38, m, high, the, watertoren, or, water, towers, in, eindhoven, netherlands, contain, three, spherical, tanks, each, 10, m, 33, ft, in, diameter, and, capable, of, holding, 500, cubic, metres, 130, 000, us, gal, of, water, on, three, 43, 45, m, 142, 6, ft, spires, were, completed, in, 1970, water, towers, can, be, surrounded, by, ornate, coverings, including, fancy, brickwork, a, large, ivy, covered, trellis, or, they, can, be, simply, painted, some, city, water, towers, have, the, name, of, the, city, painted, in, large, letters, on, the, roof, as, a, navigational, aid, to, aviators, and, motorists, sometimes, the, decoration, can, be, humorous, an, example, of, this, are, water, towers, built, side, by, side, labeled, hot, and, cold, cities, in, the, united, states, possessing, side, by, side, water, towers, labeled, hot, and, cold, include, granger, iowa, canton, kansas, pratt, kansas, and, st, clair, missouri, eveleth, minnesota, at, one, time, had, two, such, towers, but, no, longer, does, many, small, towns, in, the, united, states, use, their, water, towers, to, advertise, local, tourism, their, local, high, school, sports, teams, or, other, locally, notable, facts, a, mushroom, water, tower, was, built, in, rebro, sweden, and, holds, almost, two, million, gallons, of, water, alternatives, to, water, towers, are, simple, pumps, mounted, on, top, of, the, water, pipes, to, increase, the, water, pressure, this, new, approach, is, more, straightforward, but, also, more, subject, to, potential, public, health, risks, if, the, pumps, fail, then, loss, of, water, pressure, may, result, in, entry, of, contaminants, into, the, water, system, most, large, water, utilities, do, not, use, this, approach, given, the, potential, risks, kuwait, towers, which, include, two, water, reservoirs, and, kuwait, water, towers, mushroom, towers, in, kuwait, city, a, standpipe, is, a, water, tower, which, is, cylindrical, or, nearly, cylindrical, throughout, its, whole, height, rather, than, an, elevated, tank, on, supports, with, a, narrower, pipe, leading, to, and, from, the, ground, there, were, originally, over, 400, standpipe, water, towers, in, the, united, states, but, very, few, remain, today,
