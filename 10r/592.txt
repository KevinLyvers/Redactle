a, radio, telescope, is, a, specialized, antenna, and, radio, receiver, used, to, detect, radio, waves, from, astronomical, radio, sources, in, the, sky, radio, telescopes, are, the, main, observing, instrument, used, in, radio, astronomy, which, studies, the, radio, frequency, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, emitted, by, astronomical, objects, just, as, optical, telescopes, are, the, main, observing, instrument, used, in, traditional, optical, astronomy, which, studies, the, light, wave, portion, of, the, spectrum, coming, from, astronomical, objects, unlike, optical, telescopes, radio, telescopes, can, be, used, in, the, daytime, as, well, as, at, night, since, astronomical, radio, sources, such, as, planets, stars, nebulas, and, galaxies, are, very, far, away, the, radio, waves, coming, from, them, are, extremely, weak, so, radio, telescopes, require, very, large, antennas, to, collect, enough, radio, energy, to, study, them, and, extremely, sensitive, receiving, equipment, radio, telescopes, are, typically, large, parabolic, dish, antennas, similar, to, those, employed, in, tracking, and, communicating, with, satellites, and, space, probes, they, may, be, used, individually, or, linked, together, electronically, in, an, array, radio, observatories, are, preferentially, located, far, from, major, centers, of, population, to, avoid, electromagnetic, interference, emi, from, radio, television, radar, motor, vehicles, and, other, man, made, electronic, devices, radio, waves, from, space, were, first, detected, by, engineer, karl, guthe, jansky, in, 1932, at, bell, telephone, laboratories, in, holmdel, new, jersey, using, an, antenna, built, to, study, radio, receiver, noise, the, first, purpose, built, radio, telescope, was, a, 9, meter, parabolic, dish, constructed, by, radio, amateur, grote, reber, in, his, back, yard, in, wheaton, illinois, in, 1937, the, sky, survey, he, performed, is, often, considered, the, beginning, of, the, field, of, radio, astronomy, the, first, radio, antenna, used, to, identify, an, astronomical, radio, source, was, built, by, karl, guthe, jansky, an, engineer, with, bell, telephone, laboratories, in, 1932, jansky, was, assigned, the, task, of, identifying, sources, of, static, that, might, interfere, with, radiotelephone, service, jansky, s, antenna, was, an, array, of, dipoles, and, reflectors, designed, to, receive, short, wave, radio, signals, at, a, frequency, of, 20, 5, mhz, wavelength, about, 14, 6, meters, it, was, mounted, on, a, turntable, that, allowed, it, to, rotate, in, any, direction, earning, it, the, name, jansky, s, merry, go, round, it, had, a, diameter, of, approximately, 100, ft, 30, m, and, stood, 20, ft, 6, m, tall, by, rotating, the, antenna, the, direction, of, the, received, interfering, radio, source, static, could, be, pinpointed, a, small, shed, to, the, side, of, the, antenna, housed, an, analog, pen, and, paper, recording, system, after, recording, signals, from, all, directions, for, several, months, jansky, eventually, categorized, them, into, three, types, of, static, nearby, thunderstorms, distant, thunderstorms, and, a, faint, steady, hiss, above, shot, noise, of, unknown, origin, jansky, finally, determined, that, the, faint, hiss, repeated, on, a, cycle, of, 23, hours, and, 56, minutes, this, period, is, the, length, of, an, astronomical, sidereal, day, the, time, it, takes, any, fixed, object, located, on, the, celestial, sphere, to, come, back, to, the, same, location, in, the, sky, thus, jansky, suspected, that, the, hiss, originated, outside, of, the, solar, system, and, by, comparing, his, observations, with, optical, astronomical, maps, jansky, concluded, that, the, radiation, was, coming, from, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, was, strongest, in, the, direction, of, the, center, of, the, galaxy, in, the, constellation, of, sagittarius, an, amateur, radio, operator, grote, reber, was, one, of, the, pioneers, of, what, became, known, as, radio, astronomy, he, built, the, first, parabolic, dish, radio, telescope, 9, metres, 30, ft, in, diameter, in, his, back, yard, in, wheaton, illinois, in, 1937, he, repeated, jansky, s, pioneering, work, identifying, the, milky, way, as, the, first, off, world, radio, source, and, he, went, on, to, conduct, the, first, sky, survey, at, very, high, radio, frequencies, discovering, other, radio, sources, the, rapid, development, of, radar, during, world, war, ii, created, technology, which, was, applied, to, radio, astronomy, after, the, war, and, radio, astronomy, became, a, branch, of, astronomy, with, universities, and, research, institutes, constructing, large, radio, telescopes, the, range, of, frequencies, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, that, makes, up, the, radio, spectrum, is, very, large, as, a, consequence, the, types, of, antennas, that, are, used, as, radio, telescopes, vary, widely, in, design, size, and, configuration, at, wavelengths, of, 30, meters, to, 3, meters, 10, 100, mhz, they, are, generally, either, directional, antenna, arrays, similar, to, tv, antennas, or, large, stationary, reflectors, with, movable, focal, points, since, the, wavelengths, being, observed, with, these, types, of, antennas, are, so, long, the, reflector, surfaces, can, be, constructed, from, coarse, wire, mesh, such, as, chicken, wire, at, shorter, wavelengths, parabolic, dish, antennas, predominate, the, angular, resolution, of, a, dish, antenna, is, determined, by, the, ratio, of, the, diameter, of, the, dish, to, the, wavelength, of, the, radio, waves, being, observed, this, dictates, the, dish, size, a, radio, telescope, needs, for, a, useful, resolution, radio, telescopes, that, operate, at, wavelengths, of, 3, meters, to, 30, cm, 100, mhz, to, 1, ghz, are, usually, well, over, 100, meters, in, diameter, telescopes, working, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 30, cm, above, 1, ghz, range, in, size, from, 3, to, 90, meters, in, diameter, the, increasing, use, of, radio, frequencies, for, communication, makes, astronomical, observations, more, and, more, difficult, see, open, spectrum, negotiations, to, defend, the, frequency, allocation, for, parts, of, the, spectrum, most, useful, for, observing, the, universe, are, coordinated, in, the, scientific, committee, on, frequency, allocations, for, radio, astronomy, and, space, science, some, of, the, more, notable, frequency, bands, used, by, radio, telescopes, include, the, world, s, largest, filled, aperture, i, e, full, dish, radio, telescope, is, the, five, hundred, meter, aperture, spherical, telescope, fast, completed, in, 2016, by, china, the, 500, meter, diameter, 1, 600, ft, dish, with, an, area, as, large, as, 30, football, fields, is, built, into, a, natural, karst, depression, in, the, landscape, in, guizhou, province, and, cannot, move, the, feed, antenna, is, in, a, cabin, suspended, above, the, dish, on, cables, the, active, dish, is, composed, of, 4, 450, moveable, panels, controlled, by, a, computer, by, changing, the, shape, of, the, dish, and, moving, the, feed, cabin, on, its, cables, the, telescope, can, be, steered, to, point, to, any, region, of, the, sky, up, to, 40, from, the, zenith, although, the, dish, is, 500, meters, in, diameter, only, a, 300, meter, circular, area, on, the, dish, is, illuminated, by, the, feed, antenna, at, any, given, time, so, the, actual, effective, aperture, is, 300, meters, construction, was, begun, in, 2007, and, completed, july, 2016, and, the, telescope, became, operational, september, 25, 2016, the, world, s, second, largest, filled, aperture, telescope, was, the, arecibo, radio, telescope, located, in, arecibo, puerto, rico, though, it, suffered, catastrophic, collapse, on, 1, december, 2020, arecibo, was, one, of, the, world, s, few, radio, telescope, also, capable, of, active, i, e, transmitting, radar, imaging, of, near, earth, objects, see, radar, astronomy, most, other, telescopes, employ, passive, detection, i, e, receiving, only, arecibo, was, another, stationary, dish, telescope, like, fast, arecibo, s, 305, m, 1, 001, ft, dish, was, built, into, a, natural, depression, in, the, landscape, the, antenna, was, steerable, within, an, angle, of, about, 20, of, the, zenith, by, moving, the, suspended, feed, antenna, giving, use, of, a, 270, meter, diameter, portion, of, the, dish, for, any, individual, observation, the, largest, individual, radio, telescope, of, any, kind, is, the, ratan, 600, located, near, nizhny, arkhyz, russia, which, consists, of, a, 576, meter, circle, of, rectangular, radio, reflectors, each, of, which, can, be, pointed, towards, a, central, conical, receiver, the, above, stationary, dishes, are, not, fully, steerable, they, can, only, be, aimed, at, points, in, an, area, of, the, sky, near, the, zenith, and, cannot, receive, from, sources, near, the, horizon, the, largest, fully, steerable, dish, radio, telescope, is, the, 100, meter, green, bank, telescope, in, west, virginia, united, states, constructed, in, 2000, the, largest, fully, steerable, radio, telescope, in, europe, is, the, effelsberg, 100, m, radio, telescope, near, bonn, germany, operated, by, the, max, planck, institute, for, radio, astronomy, which, also, was, the, world, s, largest, fully, steerable, telescope, for, 30, years, until, the, green, bank, antenna, was, constructed, the, third, largest, fully, steerable, radio, telescope, is, the, 76, meter, lovell, telescope, at, jodrell, bank, observatory, in, cheshire, england, completed, in, 1957, the, fourth, largest, fully, steerable, radio, telescopes, are, six, 70, meter, dishes, three, russian, rt, 70, and, three, in, the, nasa, deep, space, network, the, planned, qitai, radio, telescope, at, a, diameter, of, 110, m, 360, ft, is, expected, to, become, the, world, s, largest, fully, steerable, single, dish, radio, telescope, when, completed, in, 2028, a, more, typical, radio, telescope, has, a, single, antenna, of, about, 25, meters, diameter, dozens, of, radio, telescopes, of, about, this, size, are, operated, in, radio, observatories, all, over, the, world, since, 1965, humans, have, launched, three, space, based, radio, telescopes, the, first, one, krt, 10, was, attached, to, salyut, 6, orbital, space, station, in, 1979, in, 1997, japan, sent, the, second, halca, the, last, one, was, sent, by, russia, in, 2011, called, spektr, r, one, of, the, most, notable, developments, came, in, 1946, with, the, introduction, of, the, technique, called, astronomical, interferometry, which, means, combining, the, signals, from, multiple, antennas, so, that, they, simulate, a, larger, antenna, in, order, to, achieve, greater, resolution, astronomical, radio, interferometers, usually, consist, either, of, arrays, of, parabolic, dishes, e, g, the, one, mile, telescope, arrays, of, one, dimensional, antennas, e, g, the, molonglo, observatory, synthesis, telescope, or, two, dimensional, arrays, of, omnidirectional, dipoles, e, g, tony, hewish, s, pulsar, array, all, of, the, telescopes, in, the, array, are, widely, separated, and, are, usually, connected, using, coaxial, cable, waveguide, optical, fiber, or, other, type, of, transmission, line, recent, advances, in, the, stability, of, electronic, oscillators, also, now, permit, interferometry, to, be, carried, out, by, independent, recording, of, the, signals, at, the, various, antennas, and, then, later, correlating, the, recordings, at, some, central, processing, facility, this, process, is, known, as, very, long, baseline, interferometry, vlbi, interferometry, does, increase, the, total, signal, collected, but, its, primary, purpose, is, to, vastly, increase, the, resolution, through, a, process, called, aperture, synthesis, this, technique, works, by, superposing, interfering, the, signal, waves, from, the, different, telescopes, on, the, principle, that, waves, that, coincide, with, the, same, phase, will, add, to, each, other, while, two, waves, that, have, opposite, phases, will, cancel, each, other, out, this, creates, a, combined, telescope, that, is, equivalent, in, resolution, though, not, in, sensitivity, to, a, single, antenna, whose, diameter, is, equal, to, the, spacing, of, the, antennas, furthest, apart, in, the, array, a, high, quality, image, requires, a, large, number, of, different, separations, between, telescopes, projected, separation, between, any, two, telescopes, as, seen, from, the, radio, source, is, called, a, baseline, for, example, the, very, large, array, vla, near, socorro, new, mexico, has, 27, telescopes, with, 351, independent, baselines, at, once, which, achieves, a, resolution, of, 0, 2, arc, seconds, at, 3, cm, wavelengths, martin, ryle, s, group, in, cambridge, obtained, a, nobel, prize, for, interferometry, and, aperture, synthesis, the, lloyd, s, mirror, interferometer, was, also, developed, independently, in, 1946, by, joseph, pawsey, s, group, at, the, university, of, sydney, in, the, early, 1950s, the, cambridge, interferometer, mapped, the, radio, sky, to, produce, the, famous, 2c, and, 3c, surveys, of, radio, sources, an, example, of, a, large, physically, connected, radio, telescope, array, is, the, giant, metrewave, radio, telescope, located, in, pune, india, the, largest, array, the, low, frequency, array, lofar, finished, in, 2012, is, located, in, western, europe, and, consists, of, about, 81, 000, small, antennas, in, 48, stations, distributed, over, an, area, several, hundreds, of, kilometers, in, diameter, and, operates, between, 1, 25, and, 30, m, wavelengths, vlbi, systems, using, post, observation, processing, have, been, constructed, with, antennas, thousands, of, miles, apart, radio, interferometers, have, also, been, used, to, obtain, detailed, images, of, the, anisotropies, and, the, polarization, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, like, the, cbi, interferometer, in, 2004, the, world, s, largest, physically, connected, telescope, the, square, kilometre, array, ska, is, planned, to, start, operations, in, 2025, many, astronomical, objects, are, not, only, observable, in, visible, light, but, also, emit, radiation, at, radio, wavelengths, besides, observing, energetic, objects, such, as, pulsars, and, quasars, radio, telescopes, are, able, to, image, most, astronomical, objects, such, as, galaxies, nebulae, and, even, radio, emissions, from, planets
