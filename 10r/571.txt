a, sextant, is, a, doubly, reflecting, navigation, instrument, that, measures, the, angular, distance, between, two, visible, objects, the, primary, use, of, a, sextant, is, to, measure, the, angle, between, an, astronomical, object, and, the, horizon, for, the, purposes, of, celestial, navigation, the, estimation, of, this, angle, the, altitude, is, known, as, sighting, or, shooting, the, object, or, taking, a, sight, the, angle, and, the, time, when, it, was, measured, can, be, used, to, calculate, a, position, line, on, a, nautical, or, aeronautical, chart, for, example, sighting, the, sun, at, noon, or, polaris, at, night, in, the, northern, hemisphere, to, estimate, latitude, with, sight, reduction, sighting, the, height, of, a, landmark, can, give, a, measure, of, distance, off, and, held, horizontally, a, sextant, can, measure, angles, between, objects, for, a, position, on, a, chart, a, sextant, can, also, be, used, to, measure, the, lunar, distance, between, the, moon, and, another, celestial, object, such, as, a, star, or, planet, in, order, to, determine, greenwich, mean, time, and, hence, longitude, the, principle, of, the, instrument, was, first, implemented, around, 1731, by, john, hadley, 1682, 1744, and, thomas, godfrey, 1704, 1749, but, it, was, also, found, later, in, the, unpublished, writings, of, isaac, newton, 1643, 1727, in, 1922, it, was, modified, for, aeronautical, navigation, by, portuguese, navigator, and, naval, officer, gago, coutinho, like, the, davis, quadrant, the, sextant, allows, celestial, objects, to, be, measured, relative, to, the, horizon, rather, than, relative, to, the, instrument, this, allows, excellent, precision, also, unlike, the, backstaff, the, sextant, allows, direct, observations, of, stars, this, permits, the, use, of, the, sextant, at, night, when, a, backstaff, is, difficult, to, use, for, solar, observations, filters, allow, direct, observation, of, the, sun, since, the, measurement, is, relative, to, the, horizon, the, measuring, pointer, is, a, beam, of, light, that, reaches, to, the, horizon, the, measurement, is, thus, limited, by, the, angular, accuracy, of, the, instrument, and, not, the, sine, error, of, the, length, of, an, alidade, as, it, is, in, a, mariner, s, astrolabe, or, similar, older, instrument, a, sextant, does, not, require, a, completely, steady, aim, because, it, measures, a, relative, angle, for, example, when, a, sextant, is, used, on, a, moving, ship, the, image, of, both, horizon, and, celestial, object, will, move, around, in, the, field, of, view, however, the, relative, position, of, the, two, images, will, remain, steady, and, as, long, as, the, user, can, determine, when, the, celestial, object, touches, the, horizon, the, accuracy, of, the, measurement, will, remain, high, compared, to, the, magnitude, of, the, movement, the, sextant, is, not, dependent, upon, electricity, unlike, many, forms, of, modern, navigation, or, any, human, controlled, signals, such, as, gps, for, these, reasons, it, is, considered, to, be, an, eminently, practical, back, up, navigation, tool, for, ships, the, frame, of, a, sextant, is, in, the, shape, of, a, sector, which, is, approximately, 1, 6, of, a, circle, 60, hence, its, name, sext, ns, sextantis, is, the, latin, word, for, one, sixth, both, smaller, and, larger, instruments, are, or, were, in, use, the, octant, quintant, or, pentant, and, the, doubly, reflecting, quadrant, span, sectors, of, approximately, 1, 8, of, a, circle, 45, 1, 5, of, a, circle, 72, and, 1, 4, of, a, circle, 90, respectively, all, of, these, instruments, may, be, termed, sextants, attached, to, the, frame, are, the, horizon, mirror, an, index, arm, which, moves, the, index, mirror, a, sighting, telescope, sun, shades, a, graduated, scale, and, a, micrometer, drum, gauge, for, accurate, measurements, the, scale, must, be, graduated, so, that, the, marked, degree, divisions, register, twice, the, angle, through, which, the, index, arm, turns, the, scales, of, the, octant, sextant, quintant, and, quadrant, are, graduated, from, below, zero, to, 90, 120, 140, and, 180, respectively, for, example, the, sextant, illustrated, has, a, scale, graduated, from, 10, to, 142, which, is, basically, a, quintant, the, frame, is, a, sector, of, a, circle, subtending, an, angle, of, 76, at, the, pivot, of, the, index, arm, the, necessity, for, the, doubled, scale, reading, follows, from, consideration, of, the, relations, of, the, fixed, ray, between, the, mirrors, the, object, ray, from, the, sighted, object, and, the, direction, of, the, normal, perpendicular, to, the, index, mirror, when, the, index, arm, moves, by, an, angle, say, 20, the, angle, between, the, fixed, ray, and, the, normal, also, increases, by, 20, but, the, angle, of, incidence, equals, the, angle, of, reflection, so, the, angle, between, the, object, ray, and, the, normal, must, also, increase, by, 20, the, angle, between, the, fixed, ray, and, the, object, ray, must, therefore, increase, by, 40, this, is, the, case, shown, in, the, graphic, there, are, two, types, of, horizon, mirrors, on, the, market, today, both, types, give, good, results, traditional, sextants, have, a, half, horizon, mirror, which, divides, the, field, of, view, in, two, on, one, side, there, is, a, view, of, the, horizon, on, the, other, side, a, view, of, the, celestial, object, the, advantage, of, this, type, is, that, both, the, horizon, and, celestial, object, are, bright, and, as, clear, as, possible, this, is, superior, at, night, and, in, haze, when, the, horizon, and, or, a, star, being, sighted, can, be, difficult, to, see, however, one, has, to, sweep, the, celestial, object, to, ensure, that, the, lowest, limb, of, the, celestial, object, touches, the, horizon, whole, horizon, sextants, use, a, half, silvered, horizon, mirror, to, provide, a, full, view, of, the, horizon, this, makes, it, easy, to, see, when, the, bottom, limb, of, a, celestial, object, touches, the, horizon, since, most, sights, are, of, the, sun, or, moon, and, haze, is, rare, without, overcast, the, low, light, advantages, of, the, half, horizon, mirror, are, rarely, important, in, practice, in, both, types, larger, mirrors, give, a, larger, field, of, view, and, thus, make, it, easier, to, find, a, celestial, object, modern, sextants, often, have, 5, cm, or, larger, mirrors, while, 19th, century, sextants, rarely, had, a, mirror, larger, than, 2, 5, cm, one, inch, in, large, part, this, is, because, precision, flat, mirrors, have, grown, less, expensive, to, manufacture, and, to, silver, an, artificial, horizon, is, useful, when, the, horizon, is, invisible, as, occurs, in, fog, on, moonless, nights, in, a, calm, when, sighting, through, a, window, or, on, land, surrounded, by, trees, or, buildings, there, are, two, common, designs, of, artificial, horizon, an, artificial, horizon, can, consist, simply, of, a, pool, of, water, shielded, from, the, wind, allowing, the, user, to, measure, the, distance, between, the, body, and, its, reflection, and, divide, by, two, another, design, allows, the, mounting, of, a, fluid, filled, tube, with, bubble, directly, to, the, sextant, most, sextants, also, have, filters, for, use, when, viewing, the, sun, and, reducing, the, effects, of, haze, the, filters, usually, consist, of, a, series, of, progressively, darker, glasses, that, can, be, used, singly, or, in, combination, to, reduce, haze, and, the, sun, s, brightness, however, sextants, with, adjustable, polarizing, filters, have, also, been, manufactured, where, the, degree, of, darkness, is, adjusted, by, twisting, the, frame, of, the, filter, most, sextants, mount, a, 1, or, 3, power, monocular, for, viewing, many, users, prefer, a, simple, sighting, tube, which, has, a, wider, brighter, field, of, view, and, is, easier, to, use, at, night, some, navigators, mount, a, light, amplifying, monocular, to, help, see, the, horizon, on, moonless, nights, others, prefer, to, use, a, lit, artificial, horizon, professional, sextants, use, a, click, stop, degree, measure, and, a, worm, adjustment, that, reads, to, a, minute, 1, 60, of, a, degree, most, sextants, also, include, a, vernier, on, the, worm, dial, that, reads, to, 0, 1, minute, since, 1, minute, of, error, is, about, a, nautical, mile, the, best, possible, accuracy, of, celestial, navigation, is, about, 0, 1, nautical, miles, 190, m, at, sea, results, within, several, nautical, miles, well, within, visual, range, are, acceptable, a, highly, skilled, and, experienced, navigator, can, determine, position, to, an, accuracy, of, about, 0, 25, nautical, mile, 460, m, a, change, in, temperature, can, warp, the, arc, creating, inaccuracies, many, navigators, purchase, weatherproof, cases, so, that, their, sextant, can, be, placed, outside, the, cabin, to, come, to, equilibrium, with, outside, temperatures, the, standard, frame, designs, see, illustration, are, supposed, to, equalise, differential, angular, error, from, temperature, changes, the, handle, is, separated, from, the, arc, and, frame, so, that, body, heat, does, not, warp, the, frame, sextants, for, tropical, use, are, often, painted, white, to, reflect, sunlight, and, remain, relatively, cool, high, precision, sextants, have, an, invar, a, special, low, expansion, steel, frame, and, arc, some, scientific, sextants, have, been, constructed, of, quartz, or, ceramics, with, even, lower, expansions, many, commercial, sextants, use, low, expansion, brass, or, aluminium, brass, is, lower, expansion, than, aluminium, but, aluminium, sextants, are, lighter, and, less, tiring, to, use, some, say, they, are, more, accurate, because, one, s, hand, trembles, less, solid, brass, frame, sextants, are, less, susceptible, to, wobbling, in, high, winds, or, when, the, vessel, is, working, in, heavy, seas, but, as, noted, are, substantially, heavier, sextants, with, aluminum, frames, and, brass, arcs, have, also, been, manufactured, essentially, a, sextant, is, intensely, personal, to, each, navigator, and, they, will, choose, whichever, model, has, the, features, which, suit, them, best, aircraft, sextants, are, now, out, of, production, but, had, special, features, most, had, artificial, horizons, to, permit, taking, a, sight, through, a, flush, overhead, window, some, also, had, mechanical, averagers, to, make, hundreds, of, measurements, per, sight, for, compensation, of, random, accelerations, in, the, artificial, horizon, s, fluid, older, aircraft, sextants, had, two, visual, paths, one, standard, and, the, other, designed, for, use, in, open, cockpit, aircraft, that, let, one, view, from, directly, over, the, sextant, in, one, s, lap, more, modern, aircraft, sextants, were, periscopic, with, only, a, small, projection, above, the, fuselage, with, these, the, navigator, pre, computed, their, sight, and, then, noted, the, difference, in, observed, versus, predicted, height, of, the, body, to, determine, their, position, a, sight, or, measure, of, the, angle, between, the, sun, a, star, or, a, planet, and, the, horizon, is, done, with, the, star, telescope, fitted, to, the, sextant, using, a, visible, horizon, on, a, vessel, at, sea, even, on, misty, days, a, sight, may, be, done, from, a, low, height, above, the, water, to, give, a, more, definite, better, horizon, navigators, hold, the, sextant, by, its, handle, in, the, right, hand, avoiding, touching, the, arc, with, the, fingers, for, a, sun, sight, a, filter, is, used, to, overcome, the, glare, such, as, shades, covering, both, index, mirror, and, the, horizon, mirror, designed, to, prevent, eye, damage, initially, with, the, index, bar, set, to, zero, and, the, shades, covering, both, mirrors, the, sextant, is, aimed, at, the, sun, until, it, can, be, viewed, on, both, mirrors, through, the, telescope, then, lowered, vertically, until, the, portion, of, the, horizon, directly, below, it, is, viewed, on, both, mirrors, it, is, necessary, to, flip, back, the, horizon, mirror, shade, to, be, able, to, see, the, horizon, more, clearly, on, it, releasing, the, index, bar, either, by, releasing, a, clamping, screw, or, on, modern, instruments, using, the, quick, release, button, and, moving, it, towards, higher, values, of, the, scale, eventually, the, image, of, the, sun, will, reappear, on, the, index, mirror, and, can, be, aligned, to, about, the, level, of, the, horizon, on, the, horizon, mirror, then, the, fine, adjustment, screw, on, the, end, of, the, index, bar, is, turned, until, the, bottom, curve, the, lower, limb, of, the, sun, just, touches, the, horizon, swinging, the, sextant, about, the, axis, of, the, telescope, ensures, that, the, reading, is, being, taken, with, the, instrument, held, vertically, the, angle, of, the, sight, is, then, read, from, the, scale, on, the, arc, making, use, of, the, micrometer, or, vernier, scale, provided, the, exact, time, of, the, sight, must, also, be, noted, simultaneously, and, the, height, of, the, eye, above, sea, level, recorded, an, alternative, method, is, to, estimate, the, current, altitude, angle, of, the, sun, from, navigation, tables, then, set, the, index, bar, to, that, angle, on, the, arc, apply, suitable, shades, only, to, the, index, mirror, and, point, the, instrument, directly, at, the, horizon, sweeping, it, from, side, to, side, until, a, flash, of, the, sun, s, rays, are, seen, in, the, telescope, fine, adjustments, are, then, made, as, above, this, method, is, less, likely, to, be, successful, for, sighting, stars, and, planets, star, and, planet, sights, are, normally, taken, during, nautical, twilight, at, dawn, or, dusk, while, both, the, heavenly, bodies, and, the, sea, horizon, are, visible, there, is, no, need, to, use, shades, or, to, distinguish, the, lower, limb, as, the, body, appears, as, a, mere, point, in, the, telescope, the, moon, can, be, sighted, but, it, appears, to, move, very, fast, appears, to, have, different, sizes, at, different, times, and, sometimes, only, the, lower, or, upper, limb, can, be, distinguished, due, to, its, phase, after, a, sight, is, taken, it, is, reduced, to, a, position, by, looking, at, several, mathematical, procedures, the, simplest, sight, reduction, is, to, draw, the, equal, altitude, circle, of, the, sighted, celestial, object, on, a, globe, the, intersection, of, that, circle, with, a, dead, reckoning, track, or, another, sighting, gives, a, more, precise, location, sextants, can, be, used, very, accurately, to, measure, other, visible, angles, for, example, between, one, heavenly, body, and, another, and, between, landmarks, ashore, used, horizontally, a, sextant, can, measure, the, apparent, angle, between, two, landmarks, such, as, a, lighthouse, and, a, church, spire, which, can, then, be, used, to, find, the, distance, off, or, out, to, sea, provided, the, distance, between, the, two, landmarks, is, known, used, vertically, a, measurement, of, the, angle, between, the, lantern, of, a, lighthouse, of, known, height, and, the, sea, level, at, its, base, can, also, be, used, for, distance, off, due, to, the, sensitivity, of, the, instrument, it, is, easy, to, knock, the, mirrors, out, of, adjustment, for, this, reason, a, sextant, should, be, checked, frequently, for, errors, and, adjusted, accordingly, there, are, four, errors, that, can, be, adjusted, by, the, navigator, and, they, should, be, removed, in, the, following, order
