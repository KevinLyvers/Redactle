wood, is, a, structural, tissue, found, in, the, stems, and, roots, of, trees, and, other, woody, plants, it, is, an, organic, material, a, natural, composite, of, cellulose, fibers, that, are, strong, in, tension, and, embedded, in, a, matrix, of, lignin, that, resists, compression, wood, is, sometimes, defined, as, only, the, secondary, xylem, in, the, stems, of, trees, or, more, broadly, to, include, the, same, type, of, tissue, elsewhere, such, as, in, the, roots, of, trees, or, shrubs, in, a, living, tree, it, performs, a, support, function, enabling, woody, plants, to, grow, large, or, to, stand, up, by, themselves, it, also, conveys, water, and, nutrients, between, the, leaves, other, growing, tissues, and, the, roots, wood, may, also, refer, to, other, plant, materials, with, comparable, properties, and, to, material, engineered, from, wood, woodchips, or, fiber, wood, has, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, for, fuel, as, a, construction, material, for, making, tools, and, weapons, furniture, and, paper, more, recently, it, emerged, as, a, feedstock, for, the, production, of, purified, cellulose, and, its, derivatives, such, as, cellophane, and, cellulose, acetate, as, of, 2020, the, growing, stock, of, forests, worldwide, was, about, 557, billion, cubic, meters, as, an, abundant, carbon, neutral, renewable, resource, woody, materials, have, been, of, intense, interest, as, a, source, of, renewable, energy, in, 2008, approximately, 3, 97, billion, cubic, meters, of, wood, were, harvested, dominant, uses, were, for, furniture, and, building, construction, wood, is, scientifically, studied, and, researched, through, the, discipline, of, wood, science, which, was, initiated, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, a, 2011, discovery, in, the, canadian, province, of, new, brunswick, yielded, the, earliest, known, plants, to, have, grown, wood, approximately, 395, to, 400, million, years, ago, wood, can, be, dated, by, carbon, dating, and, in, some, species, by, dendrochronology, to, determine, when, a, wooden, object, was, created, people, have, used, wood, for, thousands, of, years, for, many, purposes, including, as, a, fuel, or, as, a, construction, material, for, making, houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and, paper, known, constructions, using, wood, date, back, ten, thousand, years, buildings, like, the, longhouses, in, neolithic, europe, were, made, primarily, of, wood, recent, use, of, wood, has, been, enhanced, by, the, addition, of, steel, and, bronze, into, construction, the, year, to, year, variation, in, tree, ring, widths, and, isotopic, abundances, gives, clues, to, the, prevailing, climate, at, the, time, a, tree, was, cut, wood, in, the, strict, sense, is, yielded, by, trees, which, increase, in, diameter, by, the, formation, between, the, existing, wood, and, the, inner, bark, of, new, woody, layers, which, envelop, the, entire, stem, living, branches, and, roots, this, process, is, known, as, secondary, growth, it, is, the, result, of, cell, division, in, the, vascular, cambium, a, lateral, meristem, and, subsequent, expansion, of, the, new, cells, these, cells, then, go, on, to, form, thickened, secondary, cell, walls, composed, mainly, of, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, lignin, where, the, differences, between, the, seasons, are, distinct, e, g, new, zealand, growth, can, occur, in, a, discrete, annual, or, seasonal, pattern, leading, to, growth, rings, these, can, usually, be, most, clearly, seen, on, the, end, of, a, log, but, are, also, visible, on, the, other, surfaces, if, the, distinctiveness, between, seasons, is, annual, as, is, the, case, in, equatorial, regions, e, g, singapore, these, growth, rings, are, referred, to, as, annual, rings, where, there, is, little, seasonal, difference, growth, rings, are, likely, to, be, indistinct, or, absent, if, the, bark, of, the, tree, has, been, removed, in, a, particular, area, the, rings, will, likely, be, deformed, as, the, plant, overgrows, the, scar, if, there, are, differences, within, a, growth, ring, then, the, part, of, a, growth, ring, nearest, the, center, of, the, tree, and, formed, early, in, the, growing, season, when, growth, is, rapid, is, usually, composed, of, wider, elements, it, is, usually, lighter, in, color, than, that, near, the, outer, portion, of, the, ring, and, is, known, as, earlywood, or, springwood, the, outer, portion, formed, later, in, the, season, is, then, known, as, the, latewood, or, summerwood, there, are, major, differences, depending, on, the, kind, of, wood, if, a, tree, grows, all, its, life, in, the, open, and, the, conditions, of, soil, and, site, remain, unchanged, it, will, make, its, most, rapid, growth, in, youth, and, gradually, decline, the, annual, rings, of, growth, are, for, many, years, quite, wide, but, later, they, become, narrower, and, narrower, since, each, succeeding, ring, is, laid, down, on, the, outside, of, the, wood, previously, formed, it, follows, that, unless, a, tree, materially, increases, its, production, of, wood, from, year, to, year, the, rings, must, necessarily, become, thinner, as, the, trunk, gets, wider, as, a, tree, reaches, maturity, its, crown, becomes, more, open, and, the, annual, wood, production, is, lessened, thereby, reducing, still, more, the, width, of, the, growth, rings, in, the, case, of, forest, grown, trees, so, much, depends, upon, the, competition, of, the, trees, in, their, struggle, for, light, and, nourishment, that, periods, of, rapid, and, slow, growth, may, alternate, some, trees, such, as, southern, oaks, maintain, the, same, width, of, ring, for, hundreds, of, years, on, the, whole, as, a, tree, gets, larger, in, diameter, the, width, of, the, growth, rings, decreases, as, a, tree, grows, lower, branches, often, die, and, their, bases, may, become, overgrown, and, enclosed, by, subsequent, layers, of, trunk, wood, forming, a, type, of, imperfection, known, as, a, knot, the, dead, branch, may, not, be, attached, to, the, trunk, wood, except, at, its, base, and, can, drop, out, after, the, tree, has, been, sawn, into, boards, knots, affect, the, technical, properties, of, the, wood, usually, reducing, tension, strength, but, may, be, exploited, for, visual, effect, in, a, longitudinally, sawn, plank, a, knot, will, appear, as, a, roughly, circular, solid, usually, darker, piece, of, wood, around, which, the, grain, of, the, rest, of, the, wood, flows, parts, and, rejoins, within, a, knot, the, direction, of, the, wood, grain, direction, is, up, to, 90, degrees, different, from, the, grain, direction, of, the, regular, wood, in, the, tree, a, knot, is, either, the, base, of, a, side, branch, or, a, dormant, bud, a, knot, when, the, base, of, a, side, branch, is, conical, in, shape, hence, the, roughly, circular, cross, section, with, the, inner, tip, at, the, point, in, stem, diameter, at, which, the, plant, s, vascular, cambium, was, located, when, the, branch, formed, as, a, bud, in, grading, lumber, and, structural, timber, knots, are, classified, according, to, their, form, size, soundness, and, the, firmness, with, which, they, are, held, in, place, this, firmness, is, affected, by, among, other, factors, the, length, of, time, for, which, the, branch, was, dead, while, the, attaching, stem, continued, to, grow, knots, materially, affect, cracking, and, warping, ease, in, working, and, cleavability, of, timber, they, are, defects, which, weaken, timber, and, lower, its, value, for, structural, purposes, where, strength, is, an, important, consideration, the, weakening, effect, is, much, more, serious, when, timber, is, subjected, to, forces, perpendicular, to, the, grain, and, or, tension, than, when, under, load, along, the, grain, and, or, compression, the, extent, to, which, knots, affect, the, strength, of, a, beam, depends, upon, their, position, size, number, and, condition, a, knot, on, the, upper, side, is, compressed, while, one, on, the, lower, side, is, subjected, to, tension, if, there, is, a, season, check, in, the, knot, as, is, often, the, case, it, will, offer, little, resistance, to, this, tensile, stress, small, knots, may, be, located, along, the, neutral, plane, of, a, beam, and, increase, the, strength, by, preventing, longitudinal, shearing, knots, in, a, board, or, plank, are, least, injurious, when, they, extend, through, it, at, right, angles, to, its, broadest, surface, knots, which, occur, near, the, ends, of, a, beam, do, not, weaken, it, sound, knots, which, occur, in, the, central, portion, one, fourth, the, height, of, the, beam, from, either, edge, are, not, serious, defects, knots, do, not, necessarily, influence, the, stiffness, of, structural, timber, this, will, depend, on, the, size, and, location, stiffness, and, elastic, strength, are, more, dependent, upon, the, sound, wood, than, upon, localized, defects, the, breaking, strength, is, very, susceptible, to, defects, sound, knots, do, not, weaken, wood, when, subject, to, compression, parallel, to, the, grain, in, some, decorative, applications, wood, with, knots, may, be, desirable, to, add, visual, interest, in, applications, where, wood, is, painted, such, as, skirting, boards, fascia, boards, door, frames, and, furniture, resins, present, in, the, timber, may, continue, to, bleed, through, to, the, surface, of, a, knot, for, months, or, even, years, after, manufacture, and, show, as, a, yellow, or, brownish, stain, a, knot, primer, paint, or, solution, knotting, correctly, applied, during, preparation, may, do, much, to, reduce, this, problem, but, it, is, difficult, to, control, completely, especially, when, using, mass, produced, kiln, dried, timber, stocks, heartwood, or, duramen, is, wood, that, as, a, result, of, a, naturally, occurring, chemical, transformation, has, become, more, resistant, to, decay, heartwood, formation, is, a, genetically, programmed, process, that, occurs, spontaneously, some, uncertainty, exists, as, to, whether, the, wood, dies, during, heartwood, formation, as, it, can, still, chemically, react, to, decay, organisms, but, only, once, the, term, heartwood, derives, solely, from, its, position, and, not, from, any, vital, importance, to, the, tree, this, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, a, tree, can, thrive, with, its, heart, completely, decayed, some, species, begin, to, form, heartwood, very, early, in, life, so, having, only, a, thin, layer, of, live, sapwood, while, in, others, the, change, comes, slowly, thin, sapwood, is, characteristic, of, such, species, as, chestnut, black, locust, mulberry, osage, orange, and, sassafras, while, in, maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and, pine, thick, sapwood, is, the, rule, some, others, never, form, heartwood, heartwood, is, often, visually, distinct, from, the, living, sapwood, and, can, be, distinguished, in, a, cross, section, where, the, boundary, will, tend, to, follow, the, growth, rings, for, example, it, is, sometimes, much, darker, other, processes, such, as, decay, or, insect, invasion, can, also, discolor, wood, even, in, woody, plants, that, do, not, form, heartwood, which, may, lead, to, confusion, sapwood, or, alburnum, is, the, younger, outermost, wood, in, the, growing, tree, it, is, living, wood, and, its, principal, functions, are, to, conduct, water, from, the, roots, to, the, leaves, and, to, store, up, and, give, back, according, to, the, season, the, reserves, prepared, in, the, leaves, by, the, time, they, become, competent, to, conduct, water, all, xylem, tracheids, and, vessels, have, lost, their, cytoplasm, and, the, cells, are, therefore, functionally, dead, all, wood, in, a, tree, is, first, formed, as, sapwood, the, more, leaves, a, tree, bears, and, the, more, vigorous, its, growth, the, larger, the, volume, of, sapwood, required, hence, trees, making, rapid, growth, in, the, open, have, thicker, sapwood, for, their, size, than, trees, of, the, same, species, growing, in, dense, forests, sometimes, trees, of, species, that, do, form, heartwood, grown, in, the, open, may, become, of, considerable, size, 30, cm, 12, in, or, more, in, diameter, before, any, heartwood, begins, to, form, for, example, in, second, growth, hickory, or, open, grown, pines, no, definite, relation, exists, between, the, annual, rings, of, growth, and, the, amount, of, sapwood, within, the, same, species, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, sapwood, is, very, roughly, proportional, to, the, size, of, the, crown, of, the, tree, if, the, rings, are, narrow, more, of, them, are, required, than, where, they, are, wide, as, the, tree, gets, larger, the, sapwood, must, necessarily, become, thinner, or, increase, materially, in, volume, sapwood, is, relatively, thicker, in, the, upper, portion, of, the, trunk, of, a, tree, than, near, the, base, because, the, age, and, the, diameter, of, the, upper, sections, are, less, when, a, tree, is, very, young, it, is, covered, with, limbs, almost, if, not, entirely, to, the, ground, but, as, it, grows, older, some, or, all, of, them, will, eventually, die, and, are, either, broken, off, or, fall, off, subsequent, growth, of, wood, may, completely, conceal, the, stubs, which, will, remain, as, knots, no, matter, how, smooth, and, clear, a, log, is, on, the, outside, it, is, more, or, less, knotty, near, the, middle, consequently, the, sapwood, of, an, old, tree, and, particularly, of, a, forest, grown, tree, will, be, freer, from, knots, than, the, inner, heartwood, since, in, most, uses, of, wood, knots, are, defects, that, weaken, the, timber, and, interfere, with, its, ease, of, working, and, other, properties, it, follows, that, a, given, piece, of, sapwood, because, of, its, position, in, the, tree, may, well, be, stronger, than, a, piece, of, heartwood, from, the, same, tree, different, pieces, of, wood, cut, from, a, large, tree, may, differ, decidedly, particularly, if, the, tree, is, big, and, mature, in, some, trees, the, wood, laid, on, late, in, the, life, of, a, tree, is, softer, lighter, weaker, and, more, even, textured, than, that, produced, earlier, but, in, other, trees, the, reverse, applies, this, may, or, may, not, correspond, to, heartwood, and, sapwood, in, a, large, log, the, sapwood, because, of, the, time, in, the, life, of, the, tree, when, it, was, grown, may, be, inferior, in, hardness, strength, and, toughness, to, equally, sound, heartwood, from, the, same, log, in, a, smaller, tree, the, reverse, may, be, true, in, species, which, show, a, distinct, difference, between, heartwood, and, sapwood, the, natural, color, of, heartwood, is, usually, darker, than, that, of, the, sapwood, and, very, frequently, the, contrast, is, conspicuous, see, section, of, yew, log, above, this, is, produced, by, deposits, in, the, heartwood, of, chemical, substances, so, that, a, dramatic, color, variation, does, not, imply, a, significant, difference, in, the, mechanical, properties, of, heartwood, and, sapwood, although, there, may, be, a, marked, biochemical, difference, between, the, two, some, experiments, on, very, resinous, longleaf, pine, specimens, indicate, an, increase, in, strength, due, to, the, resin, which, increases, the, strength, when, dry, such, resin, saturated, heartwood, is, called, fat, lighter, structures, built, of, fat, lighter, are, almost, impervious, to, rot, and, termites, and, very, flammable, tree, stumps, of, old, longleaf, pines, are, often, dug, split, into, small, pieces, and, sold, as, kindling, for, fires, stumps, thus, dug, may, actually, remain, a, century, or, more, since, being, cut, spruce, impregnated, with, crude, resin, and, dried, is, also, greatly, increased, in, strength, thereby, since, the, latewood, of, a, growth, ring, is, usually, darker, in, color, than, the, earlywood, this, fact, may, be, used, in, visually, judging, the, density, and, therefore, the, hardness, and, strength, of, the, material, this, is, particularly, the, case, with, coniferous, woods, in, ring, porous, woods, the, vessels, of, the, early, wood, often, appear, on, a, finished, surface, as, darker, than, the, denser, latewood, though, on, cross, sections, of, heartwood, the, reverse, is, commonly, true, otherwise, the, color, of, wood, is, no, indication, of, strength, abnormal, discoloration, of, wood, often, denotes, a, diseased, condition, indicating, unsoundness, the, black, check, in, western, hemlock, is, the, result, of, insect, attacks, the, reddish, brown, streaks, so, common, in, hickory, and, certain, other, woods, are, mostly, the, result, of, injury, by, birds, the, discoloration, is, merely, an, indication, of, an, injury, and, in, all, probability, does, not, of, itself, affect, the, properties, of, the, wood, certain, rot, producing, fungi, impart, to, wood, characteristic, colors, which, thus, become, symptomatic, of, weakness, ordinary, sap, staining, is, due, to, fungal, growth, but, does, not, necessarily, produce, a, weakening, effect, water, occurs, in, living, wood, in, three, locations, namely, in, heartwood, it, occurs, only, in, the, first, and, last, forms, wood, that, is, thoroughly, air, dried, in, equilibrium, with, the, moisture, content, of, the, air, retains, 8, 16, of, the, water, in, the, cell, walls, and, none, or, practically, none, in, the, other, forms, even, oven, dried, wood, retains, a, small, percentage, of, moisture, but, for, all, except, chemical, purposes, may, be, considered, absolutely, dry, the, general, effect, of, the, water, content, upon, the, wood, substance, is, to, render, it, softer, and, more, pliable, a, similar, effect, occurs, in, the, softening, action, of, water, on, rawhide, paper, or, cloth, within, certain, limits, the, greater, the, water, content, the, greater, its, softening, effect, the, moisture, in, wood, can, be, measured, by, several, different, moisture, meters, drying, produces, a, decided, increase, in, the, strength, of, wood, particularly, in, small, specimens, an, extreme, example, is, the, case, of, a, completely, dry, spruce, block, 5, cm, in, section, which, will, sustain, a, permanent, load, four, times, as, great, as, a, green, undried, block, of, the, same, size, will, the, greatest, strength, increase, due, to, drying, is, in, the, ultimate, crushing, strength, and, strength, at, elastic, limit, in, endwise, compression, these, are, followed, by, the, modulus, of, rupture, and, stress, at, elastic, limit, in, cross, bending, while, the, modulus, of, elasticity, is, least, affected, wood, is, a, heterogeneous, hygroscopic, cellular, and, anisotropic, or, more, specifically, orthotropic, material, it, consists, of, cells, and, the, cell, walls, are, composed, of, micro, fibrils, of, cellulose, 40, 50, and, hemicellulose, 15, 25, impregnated, with, lignin, 15, 30, in, coniferous, or, softwood, species, the, wood, cells, are, mostly, of, one, kind, tracheids, and, as, a, result, the, material, is, much, more, uniform, in, structure, than, that, of, most, hardwoods, there, are, no, vessels, pores, in, coniferous, wood, such, as, one, sees, so, prominently, in, oak, and, ash, for, example, the, structure, of, hardwoods, is, more, complex, the, water, conducting, capability, is, mostly, taken, care, of, by, vessels, in, some, cases, oak, chestnut, ash, these, are, quite, large, and, distinct, in, others, buckeye, poplar, willow, too, small, to, be, seen, without, a, hand, lens, in, discussing, such, woods, it, is, customary, to, divide, them, into, two, large, classes, ring, porous, and, diffuse, porous, in, ring, porous, species, such, as, ash, black, locust, catalpa, chestnut, elm, hickory, mulberry, and, oak, the, larger, vessels, or, pores, as, cross, sections, of, vessels, are, called, are, localized, in, the, part, of, the, growth, ring, formed, in, spring, thus, forming, a, region, of, more, or, less, open, and, porous, tissue, the, rest, of, the, ring, produced, in, summer, is, made, up, of, smaller, vessels, and, a, much, greater, proportion, of, wood, fibers, these, fibers, are, the, elements, which, give, strength, and, toughness, to, wood, while, the, vessels, are, a, source, of, weakness, in, diffuse, porous, woods, the, pores, are, evenly, sized, so, that, the, water, conducting, capability, is, scattered, throughout, the, growth, ring, instead, of, being, collected, in, a, band, or, row, examples, of, this, kind, of, wood, are, alder, basswood, birch, buckeye, maple, willow, and, the, populus, species, such, as, aspen, cottonwood, and, poplar, some, species, such, as, walnut, and, cherry, are, on, the, border, between, the, two, classes, forming, an, intermediate, group, in, temperate, softwoods, there, often, is, a, marked, difference, between, latewood, and, earlywood, the, latewood, will, be, denser, than, that, formed, early, in, the, season, when, examined, under, a, microscope, the, cells, of, dense, latewood, are, seen, to, be, very, thick, walled, and, with, very, small, cell, cavities, while, those, formed, first, in, the, season, have, thin, walls, and, large, cell, cavities, the, strength, is, in, the, walls, not, the, cavities, hence, the, greater, the, proportion, of, latewood, the, greater, the, density, and, strength, in, choosing, a, piece, of, pine, where, strength, or, stiffness, is, the, important, consideration, the, principal, thing, to, observe, is, the, comparative, amounts, of, earlywood, and, latewood, the, width, of, ring, is, not, nearly, so, important, as, the, proportion, and, nature, of, the, latewood, in, the, ring, if, a, heavy, piece, of, pine, is, compared, with, a, lightweight, piece, it, will, be, seen, at, once, that, the, heavier, one, contains, a, larger, proportion, of, latewood, than, the, other, and, is, therefore, showing, more, clearly, demarcated, growth, rings, in, white, pines, there, is, not, much, contrast, between, the, different, parts, of, the, ring, and, as, a, result, the, wood, is, very, uniform, in, texture, and, is, easy, to, work, in, hard, pines, on, the, other, hand, the, latewood, is, very, dense, and, is, deep, colored, presenting, a, very, decided, contrast, to, the, soft, straw, colored, earlywood, it, is, not, only, the, proportion, of, latewood, but, also, its, quality, that, counts, in, specimens, that, show, a, very, large, proportion, of, latewood, it, may, be, noticeably, more, porous, and, weigh, considerably, less, than, the, latewood, in, pieces, that, contain, less, latewood, one, can, judge, comparative, density, and, therefore, to, some, extent, strength, by, visual, inspection, no, satisfactory, explanation, can, as, yet, be, given, for, the, exact, mechanisms, determining, the, formation, of, earlywood, and, latewood, several, factors, may, be, involved, in, conifers, at, least, rate, of, growth, alone, does, not, determine, the, proportion, of, the, two, portions, of, the, ring, for, in, some, cases, the, wood, of, slow, growth, is, very, hard, and, heavy, while, in, others, the, opposite, is, true, the, quality, of, the, site, where, the, tree, grows, undoubtedly, affects, the, character, of, the, wood, formed, though, it, is, not, possible, to, formulate, a, rule, governing, it, in, general, where, strength, or, ease, of, working, is, essential, woods, of, moderate, to, slow, growth, should, be, chosen, in, ring, porous, woods, each, season, s, growth, is, always, well, defined, because, the, large, pores, formed, early, in, the, season, abut, on, the, denser, tissue, of, the, year, before, in, the, case, of, the, ring, porous, hardwoods, there, seems, to, exist, a, pretty, definite, relation, between, the, rate, of, growth, of, timber, and, its, properties, this, may, be, briefly, summed, up, in, the, general, statement, that, the, more, rapid, the, growth, or, the, wider, the, rings, of, growth, the, heavier, harder, stronger, and, stiffer, the, wood, this, it, must, be, remembered, applies, only, to, ring, porous, woods, such, as, oak, ash, hickory, and, others, of, the, same, group, and, is, of, course, subject, to, some, exceptions, and, limitations, in, ring, porous, woods, of, good, growth, it, is, usually, the, latewood, in, which, the, thick, walled, strength, giving, fibers, are, most, abundant, as, the, breadth, of, ring, diminishes, this, latewood, is, reduced, so, that, very, slow, growth, produces, comparatively, light, porous, wood, composed, of, thin, walled, vessels, and, wood, parenchyma, in, good, oak, these, large, vessels, of, the, earlywood, occupy, from, six, to, ten, percent, of, the, volume, of, the, log, while, in, inferior, material, they, may, make, up, 25, or, more, the, latewood, of, good, oak, is, dark, colored, and, firm, and, consists, mostly, of, thick, walled, fibers, which, form, one, half, or, more, of, the, wood, in, inferior, oak, this, latewood, is, much, reduced, both, in, quantity, and, quality, such, variation, is, very, largely, the, result, of, rate, of, growth, wide, ringed, wood, is, often, called, second, growth, because, the, growth, of, the, young, timber, in, open, stands, after, the, old, trees, have, been, removed, is, more, rapid, than, in, trees, in, a, closed, forest, and, in, the, manufacture, of, articles, where, strength, is, an, important, consideration, such, second, growth, hardwood, material, is, preferred, this, is, particularly, the, case, in, the, choice, of, hickory, for, handles, and, spokes, here, not, only, strength, but, toughness, and, resilience, are, important, the, results, of, a, series, of, tests, on, hickory, by, the, u, s, forest, service, show, that, the, effect, of, rate, of, growth, on, the, qualities, of, chestnut, wood, is, summarized, by, the, same, authority, as, follows, in, the, diffuse, porous, woods, the, demarcation, between, rings, is, not, always, so, clear, and, in, some, cases, is, almost, if, not, entirely, invisible, to, the, unaided, eye, conversely, when, there, is, a, clear, demarcation, there, may, not, be, a, noticeable, difference, in, structure, within, the, growth, ring, in, diffuse, porous, woods, as, has, been, stated, the, vessels, or, pores, are, even, sized, so, that, the, water, conducting, capability, is, scattered, throughout, the, ring, instead, of, collected, in, the, earlywood, the, effect, of, rate, of, growth, is, therefore, not, the, same, as, in, the, ring, porous, woods, approaching, more, nearly, the, conditions, in, the, conifers, in, general, it, may, be, stated, that, such, woods, of, medium, growth, afford, stronger, material, than, when, very, rapidly, or, very, slowly, grown, in, many, uses, of, wood, total, strength, is, not, the, main, consideration, if, ease, of, working, is, prized, wood, should, be, chosen, with, regard, to, its, uniformity, of, texture, and, straightness, of, grain, which, will, in, most, cases, occur, when, there, is, little, contrast, between, the, latewood, of, one, season, s, growth, and, the, earlywood, of, the, next, structural, material, that, resembles, ordinary, dicot, or, conifer, timber, in, its, gross, handling, characteristics, is, produced, by, a, number, of, monocot, plants, and, these, also, are, colloquially, called, wood, of, these, bamboo, botanically, a, member, of, the, grass, family, has, considerable, economic, importance, larger, culms, being, widely, used, as, a, building, and, construction, material, and, in, the, manufacture, of, engineered, flooring, panels, and, veneer, another, major, plant, group, that, produces, material, that, often, is, called, wood, are, the, palms, of, much, less, importance, are, plants, such, as, pandanus, dracaena, and, cordyline, with, all, this, material, the, structure, and, composition, of, the, processed, raw, material, is, quite, different, from, ordinary, wood, the, single, most, revealing, property, of, wood, as, an, indicator, of, wood, quality, is, specific, gravity, timell, 1986, as, both, pulp, yield, and, lumber, strength, are, determined, by, it, specific, gravity, is, the, ratio, of, the, mass, of, a, substance, to, the, mass, of, an, equal, volume, of, water, density, is, the, ratio, of, a, mass, of, a, quantity, of, a, substance, to, the, volume, of, that, quantity, and, is, expressed, in, mass, per, unit, substance, e, g, grams, per, milliliter, g, cm, 3, or, g, ml, the, terms, are, essentially, equivalent, as, long, as, the, metric, system, is, used, upon, drying, wood, shrinks, and, its, density, increases, minimum, values, are, associated, with, green, water, saturated, wood, and, are, referred, to, as, basic, specific, gravity, timell, 1986, the, u, s, forest, products, laboratory, lists, a, variety, of, ways, to, define, specific, gravity, g, and, density, for, wood, the, fpl, has, adopted, g, b, and, g, 12, for, specific, gravity, in, accordance, with, the, astm, d2555, standard, these, are, scientifically, useful, but, don, t, represent, any, condition, that, could, physically, occur, the, fpl, wood, handbook, also, provides, formulas, for, approximately, converting, any, of, these, measurements, to, any, other, wood, density, is, determined, by, multiple, growth, and, physiological, factors, compounded, into, one, fairly, easily, measured, wood, characteristic, elliott, 1970, age, diameter, height, radial, trunk, growth, geographical, location, site, and, growing, conditions, silvicultural, treatment, and, seed, source, all, to, some, degree, influence, wood, density, variation, is, to, be, expected, within, an, individual, tree, the, variation, in, wood, density, is, often, as, great, as, or, even, greater, than, that, between, different, trees, timell, 1986, variation, of, specific, gravity, within, the, bole, of, a, tree, can, occur, in, either, the, horizontal, or, vertical, direction, because, the, specific, gravity, as, defined, above, uses, an, unrealistic, condition, woodworkers, tend, to, use, the, average, dried, weight, which, is, a, density, based, on, mass, at, 12, moisture, content, and, volume, at, the, same, 12, this, condition, occurs, when, the, wood, is, at, equilibrium, moisture, content, with, air, at, about, 65, relative, humidity, and, temperature, at, 30, c, 86, f, this, density, is, expressed, in, units, of, kg, m, 3, or, lbs, ft, 3, the, following, tables, list, the, mechanical, properties, of, wood, and, lumber, plant, species, including, bamboo, see, also, mechanical, properties, of, tonewoods, for, additional, properties, wood, properties, bamboo, properties, it, is, common, to, classify, wood, as, either, softwood, or, hardwood, the, wood, from, conifers, e, g, pine, is, called, softwood, and, the, wood, from, dicotyledons, usually, broad, leaved, trees, e, g, oak, is, called, hardwood, these, names, are, a, bit, misleading, as, hardwoods, are, not, necessarily, hard, and, softwoods, are, not, necessarily, soft, the, well, known, balsa, a, hardwood, is, actually, softer, than, any, commercial, softwood, conversely, some, softwoods, e, g, yew, are, harder, than, many, hardwoods, there, is, a, strong, relationship, between, the, properties, of, wood, and, the, properties, of, the, particular, tree, that, yielded, it, at, least, for, certain, species, for, example, in, loblolly, pine, wind, exposure, and, stem, position, greatly, affect, the, hardness, of, wood, as, well, as, compression, wood, content, the, density, of, wood, varies, with, species, the, density, of, a, wood, correlates, with, its, strength, mechanical, properties, for, example, mahogany, is, a, medium, dense, hardwood, that, is, excellent, for, fine, furniture, crafting, whereas, balsa, is, light, making, it, useful, for, model, building, one, of, the, densest, woods, is, black, ironwood, the, chemical, composition, of, wood, varies, from, species, to, species, but, is, approximately, 50, carbon, 42, oxygen, 6, hydrogen, 1, nitrogen, and, 1, other, elements, mainly, calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, and, manganese, by, weight, wood, also, contains, sulfur, chlorine, silicon, phosphorus, and, other, elements, in, small, quantity, aside, from, water, wood, has, three, main, components, cellulose, a, crystalline, polymer, derived, from, glucose, constitutes, about, 41, 43, next, in, abundance, is, hemicellulose, which, is, around, 20, in, deciduous, trees, but, near, 30, in, conifers, it, is, mainly, five, carbon, sugars, that, are, linked, in, an, irregular, manner, in, contrast, to, the, cellulose, lignin, is, the, third, component, at, around, 27, in, coniferous, wood, vs, 23, in, deciduous, trees, lignin, confers, the, hydrophobic, properties, reflecting, the, fact, that, it, is, based, on, aromatic, rings, these, three, components, are, interwoven, and, direct, covalent, linkages, exist, between, the, lignin, and, the, hemicellulose, a, major, focus, of, the, paper, industry, is, the, separation, of, the, lignin, from, the, cellulose, from, which, paper, is, made, in, chemical, terms, the, difference, between, hardwood, and, softwood, is, reflected, in, the, composition, of, the, constituent, lignin, hardwood, lignin, is, primarily, derived, from, sinapyl, alcohol, and, coniferyl, alcohol, softwood, lignin, is, mainly, derived, from, coniferyl, alcohol, aside, from, the, structural, polymers, i, e, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, lignin, lignocellulose, wood, contains, a, large, variety, of, non, structural, constituents, composed, of, low, molecular, weight, organic, compounds, called, extractives, these, compounds, are, present, in, the, extracellular, space, and, can, be, extracted, from, the, wood, using, different, neutral, solvents, such, as, acetone, analogous, content, is, present, in, the, so, called, exudate, produced, by, trees, in, response, to, mechanical, damage, or, after, being, attacked, by, insects, or, fungi, unlike, the, structural, constituents, the, composition, of, extractives, varies, over, wide, ranges, and, depends, on, many, factors, the, amount, and, composition, of, extractives, differs, between, tree, species, various, parts, of, the, same, tree, and, depends, on, genetic, factors, and, growth, conditions, such, as, climate, and, geography, for, example, slower, growing, trees, and, higher, parts, of, trees, have, higher, content, of, extractives, generally, the, softwood, is, richer, in, extractives, than, the, hardwood, their, concentration, increases, from, the, cambium, to, the, pith, barks, and, branches, also, contain, extractives, although, extractives, represent, a, small, fraction, of, the, wood, content, usually, less, than, 10, they, are, extraordinarily, diverse, and, thus, characterize, the, chemistry, of, the, wood, species, most, extractives, are, secondary, metabolites, and, some, of, them, serve, as, precursors, to, other, chemicals, wood, extractives, display, different, activities, some, of, them, are, produced, in, response, to, wounds, and, some, of, them, participate, in, natural, defense, against, insects, and, fungi, these, compounds, contribute, to, various, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, the, wood, such, as, wood, color, fragnance, durability, acoustic, properties, hygroscopicity, adhesion, and, drying, considering, these, impacts, wood, extractives, also, affect, the, properties, of, pulp, and, paper, and, importantly, cause, many, problems, in, paper, industry, some, extractives, are, surface, active, substances, and, unavoidably, affect, the, surface, properties, of, paper, such, as, water, adsorption, friction, and, strength, lipophilic, extractives, often, give, rise, to, sticky, deposits, during, kraft, pulping, and, may, leave, spots, on, paper, extractives, also, account, for, paper, smell, which, is, important, when, making, food, contact, materials, most, wood, extractives, are, lipophilic, and, only, a, little, part, is, water, soluble, the, lipophilic, portion, of, extractives, which, is, collectively, referred, as, wood, resin, contains, fats, and, fatty, acids, sterols, and, steryl, esters, terpenes, terpenoids, resin, acids, and, waxes, the, heating, of, resin, i, e, distillation, vaporizes, the, volatile, terpenes, and, leaves, the, solid, component, rosin, the, concentrated, liquid, of, volatile, compounds, extracted, during, steam, distillation, is, called, essential, oil, distillation, of, oleoresin, obtained, from, many, pines, provides, rosin, and, turpentine, most, extractives, can, be, categorized, into, three, groups, aliphatic, compounds, terpenes, and, phenolic, compounds, the, latter, are, more, water, soluble, and, usually, are, absent, in, the, resin, global, production, of, roundwood, rose, from, 3, 5, billion, m, in, 2000, to, 4, billion, m, in, 2021, in, 2021, wood, fuel, was, the, main, product, with, a, 49, percent, share, of, the, total, 2, billion, m, followed, by, coniferous, industrial, roundwood, with, 30, percent, 1, 2, billion, m, and, non, coniferous, industrial, roundwood, with, 21, percent, 0, 9, billion, m, asia, and, the, americas, are, the, two, main, producing, regions, accounting, for, 29, and, 28, percent, of, the, total, roundwood, production, respectively, africa, and, europe, have, similar, shares, of, 20, 21, percent, while, oceania, produces, the, remaining, 2, percent, wood, has, a, long, history, of, being, used, as, fuel, which, continues, to, this, day, mostly, in, rural, areas, of, the, world, hardwood, is, preferred, over, softwood, because, it, creates, less, smoke, and, burns, longer, adding, a, woodstove, or, fireplace, to, a, home, is, often, felt, to, add, ambiance, and, warmth, pulpwood, is, wood, that, is, raised, specifically, for, use, in, making, paper, wood, has, been, an, important, construction, material, since, humans, began, building, shelters, houses, and, boats, nearly, all, boats, were, made, out, of, wood, until, the, late, 19th, century, and, wood, remains, in, common, use, today, in, boat, construction, elm, in, particular, was, used, for, this, purpose, as, it, resisted, decay, as, long, as, it, was, kept, wet, it, also, served, for, water, pipe, before, the, advent, of, more, modern, plumbing, wood, to, be, used, for, construction, work, is, commonly, known, as, lumber, in, north, america, elsewhere, lumber, usually, refers, to, felled, trees, and, the, word, for, sawn, planks, ready, for, use, is, timber, in, medieval, europe, oak, was, the, wood, of, choice, for, all, wood, construction, including, beams, walls, doors, and, floors, today, a, wider, variety, of, woods, is, used, solid, wood, doors, are, often, made, from, poplar, small, knotted, pine, and, douglas, fir, new, domestic, housing, in, many, parts, of, the, world, today, is, commonly, made, from, timber, framed, construction, engineered, wood, products, are, becoming, a, bigger, part, of, the, construction, industry, they, may, be, used, in, both, residential, and, commercial, buildings, as, structural, and, aesthetic, materials, in, buildings, made, of, other, materials, wood, will, still, be, found, as, a, supporting, material, especially, in, roof, construction, in, interior, doors, and, their, frames, and, as, exterior, cladding, wood, is, also, commonly, used, as, shuttering, material, to, form, the, mold, into, which, concrete, is, poured, during, reinforced, concrete, construction, a, solid, wood, floor, is, a, floor, laid, with, planks, or, battens, created, from, a, single, piece, of, timber, usually, a, hardwood, since, wood, is, hydroscopic, it, acquires, and, loses, moisture, from, the, ambient, conditions, around, it, this, potential, instability, effectively, limits, the, length, and, width, of, the, boards, solid, hardwood, flooring, is, usually, cheaper, than, engineered, timbers, and, damaged, areas, can, be, sanded, down, and, refinished, repeatedly, the, number, of, times, being, limited, only, by, the, thickness, of, wood, above, the, tongue, solid, hardwood, floors, were, originally, used, for, structural, purposes, being, installed, perpendicular, to, the, wooden, support, beams, of, a, building, the, joists, or, bearers, and, solid, construction, timber, is, still, often, used, for, sports, floors, as, well, as, most, traditional, wood, blocks, mosaics, and, parquetry, engineered, wood, products, glued, building, products, engineered, for, application, specific, performance, requirements, are, often, used, in, construction, and, industrial, applications, glued, engineered, wood, products, are, manufactured, by, bonding, together, wood, strands, veneers, lumber, or, other, forms, of, wood, fiber, with, glue, to, form, a, larger, more, efficient, composite, structural, unit, these, products, include, glued, laminated, timber, glulam, wood, structural, panels, including, plywood, oriented, strand, board, and, composite, panels, laminated, veneer, lumber, lvl, and, other, structural, composite, lumber, scl, products, parallel, strand, lumber, and, i, joists, approximately, 100, million, cubic, meters, of, wood, was, consumed, for, this, purpose, in, 1991, the, trends, suggest, that, particle, board, and, fiber, board, will, overtake, plywood, wood, unsuitable, for, construction, in, its, native, form, may, be, broken, down, mechanically, into, fibers, or, chips, or, chemically, into, cellulose, and, used, as, a, raw, material, for, other, building, materials, such, as, engineered, wood, as, well, as, chipboard, hardboard, and, medium, density, fiberboard, mdf, such, wood, derivatives, are, widely, used, wood, fibers, are, an, important, component, of, most, paper, and, cellulose, is, used, as, a, component, of, some, synthetic, materials, wood, derivatives, can, be, used, for, kinds, of, flooring, for, example, laminate, flooring, wood, has, always, been, used, extensively, for, furniture, such, as, chairs, and, beds, it, is, also, used, for, tool, handles, and, cutlery, such, as, chopsticks, toothpicks, and, other, utensils, like, the, wooden, spoon, and, pencil, further, developments, include, new, lignin, glue, applications, recyclable, food, packaging, rubber, tire, replacement, applications, anti, bacterial, medical, agents, and, high, strength, fabrics, or, composites, as, scientists, and, engineers, further, learn, and, develop, new, techniques, to, extract, various, components, from, wood, or, alternatively, to, modify, wood, for, example, by, adding, components, to, wood, new, more, advanced, products, will, appear, on, the, marketplace, moisture, content, electronic, monitoring, can, also, enhance, next, generation, wood, protection, wood, has, long, been, used, as, an, artistic, medium, it, has, been, used, to, make, sculptures, and, carvings, for, millennia, examples, include, the, totem, poles, carved, by, north, american, indigenous, people, from, conifer, trunks, often, western, red, cedar, thuja, plicata, other, uses, of, wood, in, the, arts, include, many, types, of, sports, equipment, are, made, of, wood, or, were, constructed, of, wood, in, the, past, for, example, cricket, bats, are, typically, made, of, white, willow, the, baseball, bats, which, are, legal, for, use, in, major, league, baseball, are, frequently, made, of, ash, wood, or, hickory, and, in, recent, years, have, been, constructed, from, maple, even, though, that, wood, is, somewhat, more, fragile, national, basketball, association, courts, have, been, traditionally, made, out, of, parquetry, many, other, types, of, sports, and, recreation, equipment, such, as, skis, ice, hockey, sticks, lacrosse, sticks, and, archery, bows, were, commonly, made, of, wood, in, the, past, but, have, since, been, replaced, with, more, modern, materials, such, as, aluminium, titanium, or, composite, materials, such, as, fiberglass, and, carbon, fiber, one, noteworthy, example, of, this, trend, is, the, family, of, golf, clubs, commonly, known, as, the, woods, the, heads, of, which, were, traditionally, made, of, persimmon, wood, in, the, early, days, of, the, game, of, golf, but, are, now, generally, made, of, metal, or, especially, in, the, case, of, drivers, carbon, fiber, composites, little, is, known, about, the, bacteria, that, degrade, cellulose, symbiotic, bacteria, in, xylophaga, may, play, a, role, in, the, degradation, of, sunken, wood, alphaproteobacteria, flavobacteria, actinomycetota, clostridia, and, bacteroidota, have, been, detected, in, wood, submerged, for, over, a, year, this, article, incorporates, text, from,
