in, electronics, a, remote, control, also, known, as, a, remote, or, clicker, is, an, electronic, device, used, to, operate, another, device, from, a, distance, usually, wirelessly, in, consumer, electronics, a, remote, control, can, be, used, to, operate, devices, such, as, a, television, set, dvd, player, or, other, digital, home, media, appliance, a, remote, control, can, allow, operation, of, devices, that, are, out, of, convenient, reach, for, direct, operation, of, controls, they, function, best, when, used, from, a, short, distance, this, is, primarily, a, convenience, feature, for, the, user, in, some, cases, remote, controls, allow, a, person, to, operate, a, device, that, they, otherwise, would, not, be, able, to, reach, as, when, a, garage, door, opener, is, triggered, from, outside, early, television, remote, controls, 1956, 1977, used, ultrasonic, tones, present, day, remote, controls, are, commonly, consumer, infrared, devices, which, send, digitally, coded, pulses, of, infrared, radiation, they, control, functions, such, as, power, volume, channels, playback, track, change, energy, fan, speed, and, various, other, features, remote, controls, for, these, devices, are, usually, small, wireless, handheld, objects, with, an, array, of, buttons, they, are, used, to, adjust, various, settings, such, as, television, channel, track, number, and, volume, the, remote, control, code, and, thus, the, required, remote, control, device, is, usually, specific, to, a, product, line, however, there, are, universal, remotes, which, emulate, the, remote, control, made, for, most, major, brand, devices, remote, controls, in, the, 2000s, include, bluetooth, or, wi, fi, connectivity, motion, sensor, enabled, capabilities, and, voice, control, remote, controls, for, 2010s, onward, smart, tvs, may, feature, a, standalone, keyboard, on, the, rear, side, to, facilitate, typing, and, be, usable, as, a, pointing, device, wired, and, wireless, remote, control, was, developed, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, to, meet, the, need, to, control, unmanned, vehicles, for, the, most, part, military, torpedoes, these, included, a, wired, version, by, german, engineer, werner, von, siemens, in, 1870, and, radio, controlled, ones, by, british, engineer, ernest, wilson, and, c, j, evans, 1897, and, a, prototype, that, inventor, nikola, tesla, demonstrated, in, new, york, in, 1898, in, 1903, spanish, engineer, leonardo, torres, quevedo, introduced, a, radio, based, control, system, called, the, telekino, at, the, paris, academy, of, sciences, which, he, hoped, to, use, to, control, a, dirigible, airship, of, his, own, design, unlike, previous, on, off, techniques, the, telekino, was, able, to, execute, a, finite, and, non, limited, set, of, different, mechanical, actions, using, a, single, communication, channel, from, 1904, to, 1906, torres, chose, to, conduct, telekino, testings, in, the, form, of, a, three, wheeled, land, vehicle, with, an, effective, range, of, 20, to, 30, meters, and, guiding, a, manned, electrically, powered, boat, which, demonstrated, a, standoff, range, of, 2, kilometers, the, first, remote, controlled, model, airplane, flew, in, 1932, and, the, use, of, remote, control, technology, for, military, purposes, was, worked, on, intensively, during, the, second, world, war, one, result, of, this, being, the, german, wasserfall, missile, by, the, late, 1930s, several, radio, manufacturers, offered, remote, controls, for, some, of, their, higher, end, models, most, of, these, were, connected, to, the, set, being, controlled, by, wires, but, the, philco, mystery, control, 1939, was, a, battery, operated, low, frequency, radio, transmitter, thus, making, it, the, first, wireless, remote, control, for, a, consumer, electronics, device, using, pulse, count, modulation, this, also, was, the, first, digital, wireless, remote, control, the, first, remote, intended, to, control, a, television, was, developed, by, zenith, radio, corporation, in, 1950, the, remote, called, lazy, bones, was, connected, to, the, television, by, a, wire, a, wireless, remote, control, the, flash, matic, was, developed, in, 1955, by, eugene, polley, it, worked, by, shining, a, beam, of, light, onto, one, of, four, photoelectric, cells, but, the, cell, did, not, distinguish, between, light, from, the, remote, and, light, from, other, sources, the, flashmatic, also, had, to, be, pointed, very, precisely, at, one, of, the, sensors, in, order, to, work, in, 1956, robert, adler, developed, zenith, space, command, a, wireless, remote, it, was, mechanical, and, used, ultrasound, to, change, the, channel, and, volume, when, the, user, pushed, a, button, on, the, remote, control, it, struck, a, bar, and, clicked, hence, they, were, commonly, called, clickers, and, the, mechanics, were, similar, to, a, pluck, each, of, the, four, bars, emitted, a, different, fundamental, frequency, with, ultrasonic, harmonics, and, circuits, in, the, television, detected, these, sounds, and, interpreted, them, as, channel, up, channel, down, sound, on, off, and, power, on, off, later, the, rapid, decrease, in, price, of, transistors, made, possible, cheaper, electronic, remotes, that, contained, a, piezoelectric, crystal, that, was, fed, by, an, oscillating, electric, current, at, a, frequency, near, or, above, the, upper, threshold, of, human, hearing, though, still, audible, to, dogs, the, receiver, contained, a, microphone, attached, to, a, circuit, that, was, tuned, to, the, same, frequency, some, problems, with, this, method, were, that, the, receiver, could, be, triggered, accidentally, by, naturally, occurring, noises, or, deliberately, by, metal, against, glass, for, example, and, some, people, could, hear, the, lower, ultrasonic, harmonics, in, 1970, rca, introduced, an, all, electronic, remote, control, that, uses, digital, signals, and, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, memory, this, was, widely, adopted, for, color, television, replacing, motor, driven, tuning, controls, the, impetus, for, a, more, complex, type, of, television, remote, control, came, in, 1973, with, the, development, of, the, ceefax, teletext, service, by, the, bbc, most, commercial, remote, controls, at, that, time, had, a, limited, number, of, functions, sometimes, as, few, as, three, next, channel, previous, channel, and, volume, off, this, type, of, control, did, not, meet, the, needs, of, teletext, sets, where, pages, were, identified, with, three, digit, numbers, a, remote, control, that, selects, teletext, pages, would, need, buttons, for, each, numeral, from, zero, to, nine, as, well, as, other, control, functions, such, as, switching, from, text, to, picture, and, the, normal, television, controls, of, volume, channel, brightness, color, intensity, etc, early, teletext, sets, used, wired, remote, controls, to, select, pages, but, the, continuous, use, of, the, remote, control, required, for, teletext, quickly, indicated, the, need, for, a, wireless, device, so, bbc, engineers, began, talks, with, one, or, two, television, manufacturers, which, led, to, early, prototypes, in, around, 1977, 1978, that, could, control, many, more, functions, itt, was, one, of, the, companies, and, later, gave, its, name, to, the, itt, protocol, of, infrared, communication, in, 1980, the, most, popular, remote, control, was, the, starcom, cable, tv, converter, from, jerrold, electronics, a, division, of, general, instrument, which, used, 40, khz, sound, to, change, channels, then, a, canadian, company, viewstar, inc, was, formed, by, engineer, paul, hrivnak, and, started, producing, a, cable, tv, converter, with, an, infrared, remote, control, the, product, was, sold, through, philips, for, approximately, 190, cad, the, viewstar, converter, was, an, immediate, success, the, millionth, converter, being, sold, on, march, 21, 1985, with, 1, 6, million, sold, by, 1989, the, blab, off, was, a, wired, remote, control, created, in, 1952, that, turned, a, tv, s, television, sound, on, or, off, so, that, viewers, could, avoid, hearing, commercials, in, the, 1980s, steve, wozniak, of, apple, started, a, company, named, cl, 9, the, purpose, of, this, company, was, to, create, a, remote, control, that, could, operate, multiple, electronic, devices, the, core, unit, controller, of, remote, equipment, was, introduced, in, the, fall, of, 1987, the, advantage, to, this, remote, controller, was, that, it, could, learn, remote, signals, from, different, devices, it, had, the, ability, to, perform, specific, or, multiple, functions, at, various, times, with, its, built, in, clock, it, was, the, first, remote, control, that, could, be, linked, to, a, computer, and, loaded, with, updated, software, code, as, needed, the, core, unit, never, made, a, huge, impact, on, the, market, it, was, much, too, cumbersome, for, the, average, user, to, program, but, it, received, rave, reviews, from, those, who, could, these, obstacles, eventually, led, to, the, demise, of, cl, 9, but, two, of, its, employees, continued, the, business, under, the, name, celadon, this, was, one, of, the, first, computer, controlled, learning, remote, controls, on, the, market, in, the, 1990s, cars, were, increasingly, sold, with, electronic, remote, control, door, locks, these, remotes, transmit, a, signal, to, the, car, which, locks, or, unlocks, the, door, locks, or, unlocks, the, trunk, an, aftermarket, device, sold, in, some, countries, is, the, remote, starter, this, enables, a, car, owner, to, remotely, start, their, car, this, feature, is, most, associated, with, countries, with, winter, climates, where, users, may, wish, to, run, the, car, for, several, minutes, before, they, intend, to, use, it, so, that, the, car, heater, and, defrost, systems, can, remove, ice, and, snow, from, the, windows, by, the, early, 2000s, the, number, of, consumer, electronic, devices, in, most, homes, greatly, increased, along, with, the, number, of, remotes, to, control, those, devices, according, to, the, consumer, electronics, association, an, average, us, home, has, four, remotes, to, operate, a, home, theater, as, many, as, five, or, six, remotes, may, be, required, including, one, for, cable, or, satellite, receiver, vcr, or, digital, video, recorder, dvr, pvr, dvd, player, tv, and, audio, amplifier, several, of, these, remotes, may, need, to, be, used, sequentially, for, some, programs, or, services, to, work, properly, however, as, there, are, no, accepted, interface, guidelines, the, process, is, increasingly, cumbersome, one, solution, used, to, reduce, the, number, of, remotes, that, have, to, be, used, is, the, universal, remote, a, remote, control, that, is, programmed, with, the, operation, codes, for, most, major, brands, of, tvs, dvd, players, etc, in, the, early, 2010s, many, smartphone, manufacturers, began, incorporating, infrared, emitters, into, their, devices, thereby, enabling, their, use, as, universal, remotes, via, an, included, or, downloadable, app, the, main, technology, used, in, home, remote, controls, is, infrared, ir, light, the, signal, between, a, remote, control, handset, and, the, device, it, controls, consists, of, pulses, of, infrared, light, which, is, invisible, to, the, human, eye, but, can, be, seen, through, a, digital, camera, video, camera, or, phone, camera, the, transmitter, in, the, remote, control, handset, sends, out, a, stream, of, pulses, of, infrared, light, when, the, user, presses, a, button, on, the, handset, a, transmitter, is, often, a, light, emitting, diode, led, which, is, built, into, the, pointing, end, of, the, remote, control, handset, the, infrared, light, pulses, form, a, pattern, unique, to, that, button, the, receiver, in, the, device, recognizes, the, pattern, and, causes, the, device, to, respond, accordingly, most, remote, controls, for, electronic, appliances, use, a, near, infrared, diode, to, emit, a, beam, of, light, that, reaches, the, device, a, 940, nm, wavelength, led, is, typical, this, infrared, light, is, not, visible, to, the, human, eye, but, picked, up, by, sensors, on, the, receiving, device, video, cameras, see, the, diode, as, if, it, produces, visible, purple, light, with, a, single, channel, single, function, one, button, remote, control, the, presence, of, a, carrier, signal, can, be, used, to, trigger, a, function, for, multi, channel, normal, multi, function, remote, controls, more, sophisticated, procedures, are, necessary, one, consists, of, modulating, the, carrier, with, signals, of, different, frequencies, after, the, receiver, demodulates, the, received, signal, it, applies, the, appropriate, frequency, filters, to, separate, the, respective, signals, one, can, often, hear, the, signals, being, modulated, on, the, infrared, carrier, by, operating, a, remote, control, in, very, close, proximity, to, an, am, radio, not, tuned, to, a, station, today, ir, remote, controls, almost, always, use, a, pulse, width, modulated, code, encoded, and, decoded, by, a, digital, computer, a, command, from, a, remote, control, consists, of, a, short, train, of, pulses, of, carrier, present, and, carrier, not, present, of, varying, widths, different, manufacturers, of, infrared, remote, controls, use, different, protocols, to, transmit, the, infrared, commands, the, rc, 5, protocol, that, has, its, origins, within, philips, uses, for, instance, a, total, of, 14, bits, for, each, button, press, the, bit, pattern, is, modulated, onto, a, carrier, frequency, that, again, can, be, different, for, different, manufacturers, and, standards, in, the, case, of, rc, 5, the, carrier, is, 36, khz, other, consumer, infrared, protocols, include, the, various, versions, of, sircs, used, by, sony, the, rc, 6, from, philips, the, ruwido, r, step, and, the, nec, tc101, protocol, since, infrared, ir, remote, controls, use, light, they, require, line, of, sight, to, operate, the, destination, device, the, signal, can, however, be, reflected, by, mirrors, just, like, any, other, light, source, if, operation, is, required, where, no, line, of, sight, is, possible, for, instance, when, controlling, equipment, in, another, room, or, installed, in, a, cabinet, many, brands, of, ir, extenders, are, available, for, this, on, the, market, most, of, these, have, an, ir, receiver, picking, up, the, ir, signal, and, relaying, it, via, radio, waves, to, the, remote, part, which, has, an, ir, transmitter, mimicking, the, original, ir, control, infrared, receivers, also, tend, to, have, a, more, or, less, limited, operating, angle, which, mainly, depends, on, the, optical, characteristics, of, the, phototransistor, however, it, is, easy, to, increase, the, operating, angle, using, a, matte, transparent, object, in, front, of, the, receiver, radio, remote, control, rf, remote, control, is, used, to, control, distant, objects, using, a, variety, of, radio, signals, transmitted, by, the, remote, control, device, as, a, complementary, method, to, infrared, remote, controls, the, radio, remote, control, is, used, with, electric, garage, door, or, gate, openers, automatic, barrier, systems, burglar, alarms, and, industrial, automation, systems, standards, used, for, rf, remotes, are, bluetooth, avrcp, zigbee, rf4ce, z, wave, most, remote, controls, use, their, own, coding, transmitting, from, 8, to, 100, or, more, pulses, fixed, or, rolling, code, using, ook, or, fsk, modulation, also, transmitters, or, receivers, can, be, universal, meaning, they, are, able, to, work, with, many, different, codings, in, this, case, the, transmitter, is, normally, called, a, universal, remote, control, duplicator, because, it, is, able, to, copy, existing, remote, controls, while, the, receiver, is, called, a, universal, receiver, because, it, works, with, almost, any, remote, control, in, the, market, a, radio, remote, control, system, commonly, has, two, parts, transmit, and, receive, the, transmitter, part, is, divided, into, two, parts, the, rf, remote, control, and, the, transmitter, module, this, allows, the, transmitter, module, to, be, used, as, a, component, in, a, larger, application, the, transmitter, module, is, small, but, users, must, have, detailed, knowledge, to, use, it, combined, with, the, rf, remote, control, it, is, much, simpler, to, use, the, receiver, is, generally, one, of, two, types, a, super, regenerative, receiver, or, a, superheterodyne, the, super, regenerative, receiver, works, like, that, of, an, intermittent, oscillation, detection, circuit, the, superheterodyne, works, like, the, one, in, a, radio, receiver, the, superheterodyne, receiver, is, used, because, of, its, stability, high, sensitivity, and, it, has, relatively, good, anti, interference, ability, a, small, package, and, lower, price, a, remote, control, is, used, for, controlling, substations, pump, storage, power, stations, and, hvdc, plants, for, these, systems, often, plc, systems, working, in, the, longwave, range, are, used, a, subset, of, power, line, communication, that, sends, remote, control, signals, over, energized, ac, power, lines, this, was, used, to, remotely, control, home, automation, before, the, invention, of, wifi, connected, smart, switches, garage, and, gate, remote, controls, are, very, common, especially, in, some, countries, such, as, the, us, australia, and, the, uk, where, garage, doors, gates, and, barriers, are, widely, used, such, a, remote, is, very, simple, by, design, usually, only, one, button, and, some, with, more, buttons, to, control, several, gates, from, one, control, such, remotes, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, by, the, encoder, type, used, fixed, code, and, rolling, code, if, you, find, dip, switches, in, the, remote, it, is, likely, to, be, fixed, code, an, older, technology, which, was, widely, used, however, fixed, codes, have, been, criticized, for, their, lack, of, security, thus, rolling, code, has, been, more, and, more, widely, used, in, later, installations, remotely, operated, torpedoes, were, demonstrated, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, form, of, several, types, of, remotely, controlled, torpedoes, the, early, 1870s, saw, remotely, controlled, torpedoes, by, john, ericsson, pneumatic, john, louis, lay, electric, wire, guided, and, victor, von, scheliha, electric, wire, guided, the, brennan, torpedo, invented, by, louis, brennan, in, 1877, was, powered, by, two, contra, rotating, propellers, that, were, spun, by, rapidly, pulling, out, wires, from, drums, wound, inside, the, torpedo, differential, speed, on, the, wires, connected, to, the, shore, station, allowed, the, torpedo, to, be, guided, to, its, target, making, it, the, world, s, first, practical, guided, missile, in, 1898, nikola, tesla, publicly, demonstrated, a, wireless, radio, controlled, torpedo, that, he, hoped, to, sell, to, the, u, s, navy, archibald, low, was, known, as, the, father, of, radio, guidance, systems, for, his, pioneering, work, on, guided, rockets, and, planes, during, the, first, world, war, in, 1917, he, demonstrated, a, remote, controlled, aircraft, to, the, royal, flying, corps, and, in, the, same, year, built, the, first, wire, guided, rocket, as, head, of, the, secret, rfc, experimental, works, at, feltham, a, m, low, was, the, first, person, to, use, radio, control, successfully, on, an, aircraft, an, aerial, target, it, was, piloted, from, the, ground, by, future, world, aerial, speed, record, holder, henry, segrave, low, s, systems, encoded, the, command, transmissions, as, a, countermeasure, to, prevent, enemy, intervention, by, 1918, the, secret, d, c, b, section, of, the, royal, navy, s, signals, school, portsmouth, under, the, command, of, eric, robinson, v, c, used, a, variant, of, the, aerial, target, s, radio, control, system, to, control, from, mother, aircraft, different, types, of, naval, vessels, including, a, submarine, the, military, also, developed, several, early, remote, control, vehicles, in, world, war, i, the, imperial, german, navy, employed, fl, boats, fernlenkboote, against, coastal, shipping, these, were, driven, by, internal, combustion, engines, and, controlled, remotely, from, a, shore, station, through, several, miles, of, wire, wound, on, a, spool, on, the, boat, an, aircraft, was, used, to, signal, directions, to, the, shore, station, embs, carried, a, high, explosive, charge, in, the, bow, and, traveled, at, speeds, of, thirty, knots, the, soviet, red, army, used, remotely, controlled, teletanks, during, the, 1930s, in, the, winter, war, against, finland, and, the, early, stages, of, world, war, ii, a, teletank, is, controlled, by, radio, from, a, control, tank, at, a, distance, of, 500, to, 1, 500, meters, the, two, constituting, a, telemechanical, group, the, red, army, fielded, at, least, two, teletank, battalions, at, the, beginning, of, the, great, patriotic, war, there, were, also, remotely, controlled, cutters, and, experimental, remotely, controlled, planes, in, the, red, army, remote, controls, in, military, usage, employ, jamming, and, countermeasures, against, jamming, jammers, are, used, to, disable, or, sabotage, the, enemy, s, use, of, remote, controls, the, distances, for, military, remote, controls, also, tend, to, be, much, longer, up, to, intercontinental, distance, satellite, linked, remote, controls, used, by, the, u, s, for, their, unmanned, airplanes, drones, in, afghanistan, iraq, and, pakistan, remote, controls, are, used, by, insurgents, in, iraq, and, afghanistan, to, attack, coalition, and, government, troops, with, roadside, improvised, explosive, devices, and, terrorists, in, iraq, are, reported, in, the, media, to, use, modified, tv, remote, controls, to, detonate, bombs, in, the, winter, of, 1971, the, soviet, union, explored, the, surface, of, the, moon, with, the, lunar, vehicle, lunokhod, 1, the, first, roving, remote, controlled, robot, to, land, on, another, celestial, body, remote, control, technology, is, also, used, in, space, travel, for, instance, the, soviet, lunokhod, vehicles, were, remote, controlled, from, the, ground, many, space, exploration, rovers, can, be, remotely, controlled, though, vast, distance, to, a, vehicle, results, in, a, long, time, delay, between, transmission, and, receipt, of, a, command, existing, infrared, remote, controls, can, be, used, to, control, pc, applications, any, application, that, supports, shortcut, keys, can, be, controlled, via, infrared, remote, controls, from, other, home, devices, tv, vcr, ac, this, is, widely, used, with, multimedia, applications, for, pc, based, home, theater, systems, for, this, to, work, one, needs, a, device, that, decodes, ir, remote, control, data, signals, and, a, pc, application, that, communicates, to, this, device, connected, to, pc, a, connection, can, be, made, via, serial, port, usb, port, or, motherboard, irda, connector, such, devices, are, commercially, available, but, can, be, homemade, using, low, cost, microcontrollers, lirc, linux, ir, remote, control, and, winlirc, for, windows, are, software, packages, developed, for, the, purpose, of, controlling, pc, using, tv, remote, and, can, be, also, used, for, homebrew, remote, with, lesser, modification, remote, controls, are, used, in, photography, in, particular, to, take, long, exposure, shots, many, action, cameras, such, as, the, gopros, as, well, as, standard, dslrs, including, sony, s, alpha, series, incorporate, wi, fi, based, remote, control, systems, these, can, often, be, accessed, and, even, controlled, via, cell, phones, and, other, mobile, devices, video, game, consoles, had, not, used, wireless, controllers, until, recently, mainly, because, of, the, difficulty, involved, in, playing, the, game, while, keeping, the, infrared, transmitter, pointed, at, the, console, early, wireless, controllers, were, cumbersome, and, when, powered, on, alkaline, batteries, lasted, only, a, few, hours, before, they, needed, replacement, some, wireless, controllers, were, produced, by, third, parties, in, most, cases, using, a, radio, link, instead, of, infrared, even, these, were, very, inconsistent, and, in, some, cases, had, transmission, delays, making, them, virtually, useless, some, examples, include, the, double, player, for, nes, the, master, system, remote, control, system, and, the, wireless, dual, shot, for, the, playstation, the, first, official, wireless, game, controller, made, by, a, first, party, manufacturer, was, the, cx, 42, for, atari, 2600, the, philips, cd, i, 400, series, also, came, with, a, remote, control, the, wavebird, was, also, produced, for, the, gamecube, in, the, seventh, generation, of, gaming, consoles, wireless, controllers, became, standard, some, wireless, controllers, such, as, those, of, the, playstation, 3, and, wii, use, bluetooth, others, like, the, xbox, 360, use, proprietary, wireless, protocols, to, be, turned, on, by, a, wireless, remote, the, controlled, appliance, must, always, be, partly, on, consuming, standby, power, hand, gesture, recognition, has, been, researched, as, an, alternative, to, remote, controls, for, television, sets
