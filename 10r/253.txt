competence, test, in, places, such, as, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, canada, switzerland, australia, and, south, africa, it, is, also, common, that, the, skill, can, be, learned, by,

archaeological, evidence, of, carpentry, are, water, well, casings, these, include, an, oak, and, hazel, structure, dating, from, 5256, bc, found, in, ostrov, czech, republic, and, one, built, using, split, oak, timbers, with, mortise, and, tenon, and, notched, corners, excavated, in, eastern, germany, dating, from, about, 7, 000, years, ago, in, the, early, neolithic, period, relatively, little, history, of, carpentry, was, preserved, before, written, language, knowledge, and, skills, were, simply, passed, down, over, the, generations, even, the, advent, of, cave, painting, and, writing, recorded, little, the, oldest, surviving, complete, architectural, text, is, vitruvius, ten, books, collectively, titled, de, architectura, which, discuss, some, carpentry, it, was, only, with, the,

18th, century, part, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, invention, of, the, steam, engine, and, cut, nails, these, technologies, combined, with, the, invention, of, the, circular, saw, led, to, the, development, of, balloon, framing, which, was, the, beginning, of, the, decline, of, traditional, timber, framing, the, 19th, century, saw, the, development, of, electrical, engineering, and, distribution, which, allowed, the, development, of, hand, held, power, tools, wire, nails, and, machines, to, mass, produce, screws, in, the, 20th, century, portland, cement, came, into, common, use,
