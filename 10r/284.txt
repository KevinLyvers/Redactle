a, ladder, is, a, vertical, or, inclined, set, of, rungs, or, steps, commonly, used, for, climbing, or, descending, there, are, two, types, rigid, ladders, that, are, self, supporting, or, that, may, be, leaned, against, a, vertical, surface, such, as, a, wall, and, rollable, ladders, such, as, those, made, of, rope, or, aluminium, that, may, be, hung, from, the, top, the, vertical, members, of, a, rigid, ladder, are, called, stringers, or, rails, us, or, stiles, uk, rigid, ladders, are, usually, portable, but, some, types, are, permanently, fixed, to, a, structure, building, or, equipment, they, are, commonly, made, of, metal, wood, or, fiberglass, but, they, have, been, known, to, be, made, of, tough, plastic, ladders, are, ancient, tools, and, technology, a, ladder, is, featured, in, a, mesolithic, rock, painting, that, is, at, least, 10, 000, years, old, depicted, in, the, spider, caves, in, valencia, spain, the, painting, depicts, two, humans, using, a, ladder, to, reach, a, wild, honeybee, nest, to, harvest, honey, the, ladder, is, depicted, as, long, and, flexible, possibly, made, out, of, some, sort, of, grass, rigid, ladders, are, available, in, many, forms, such, as, rigid, ladders, were, originally, made, of, wood, but, in, the, 20th, century, aluminium, became, more, common, because, of, its, lighter, weight, ladders, with, fiberglass, stiles, are, used, for, working, on, or, near, overhead, electrical, wires, because, fiberglass, is, an, electrical, insulator, henry, quackenbush, patented, the, extension, ladder, in, 1867, the, most, common, injury, made, by, ladder, climbers, is, bruising, from, falling, off, a, ladder, but, bone, fractures, are, common, and, head, injuries, are, also, likely, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, accident, ladders, can, cause, injury, if, they, slip, on, the, ground, and, fall, to, avoid, this, they, tend, to, have, plastic, feet, or, base, pads, which, increase, friction, with, the, ground, however, if, the, plastic, is, badly, worn, the, aluminium, may, contact, the, ground, increasing, the, chance, of, an, accident, ladder, stabilizers, are, also, available, to, increase, the, ladder, s, grip, on, the, ground, one, of, the, first, ladder, stabilizers, or, ladder, feet, was, offered, in, 1936, and, today, they, are, standard, equipment, on, most, large, ladders, a, ladder, standoff, or, stay, is, a, device, fitted, to, the, top, of, a, ladder, to, hold, it, away, from, the, wall, this, enables, the, ladder, to, clear, overhanging, obstacles, such, as, the, eaves, of, a, roof, and, increases, the, safe, working, height, for, a, given, length, of, ladder, because, of, the, increased, separation, distance, of, the, two, contact, points, at, the, top, of, the, ladder, it, has, become, increasingly, common, to, provide, anchor, points, on, buildings, to, which, the, top, rung, of, an, extension, ladder, can, be, attached, especially, for, activities, like, window, cleaning, especially, if, a, fellow, worker, is, not, available, for, footing, the, ladder, footing, occurs, when, another, worker, stands, on, the, lowest, rung, and, so, provides, much, greater, stability, to, the, ladder, when, being, used, however, footing, a, ladder, should, be, seen, as, a, last, resort, for, a, safe, placement, the, anchor, point, is, usually, a, ring, cemented, into, a, slot, in, the, brick, wall, to, which, the, rungs, of, a, ladder, can, be, attached, using, rope, for, example, or, a, carabiner, if, a, leaning, ladder, is, placed, at, the, wrong, angle, the, risk, of, a, fall, is, greatly, increased, the, safest, angle, for, a, ladder, is, 75, 5, if, it, is, too, shallow, the, bottom, of, the, ladder, is, at, risk, of, sliding, and, if, it, is, too, steep, the, ladder, may, fall, backwards, this, angle, is, achieved, by, following, the, 4, to, 1, rule, for, a, ladder, placed, on, a, vertical, wall, for, every, four, feet, of, vertical, height, the, ladder, foot, should, move, one, foot, from, the, wall, both, scenarios, can, cause, significant, injury, and, are, especially, important, in, industries, like, construction, which, require, heavy, use, of, ladders, the, european, union, and, the, united, kingdom, established, a, ladder, certification, system, ladder, classes, for, any, ladders, manufactured, or, sold, in, europe, the, certification, classes, apply, solely, to, ladders, that, are, portable, such, as, stepladders, and, extension, ladders, and, are, broken, down, into, three, types, of, certification, each, ladder, certification, is, colour, coded, to, indicate, the, amount, of, weight, the, ladder, is, designed, to, hold, the, certification, class, and, its, use, the, color, of, the, safety, label, specifies, the, class, and, use, a, common, superstition, in, english, speaking, countries, is, that, walking, under, a, ladder, is, seen, as, bad, luck, some, sources, claim, that, this, stems, from, the, image, of, a, ladder, being, propped, up, against, a, wall, looking, similar, to, a, gallows, while, others, attribute, it, to, ancient, egyptian, traditions, involving, pyramids, and, triangles, representing, the, trinity, of, the, gods, and, passing, through, the, triangular, shape, made, by, a, ladder, against, a, wall, was, seen, as, desecration, ladders, have, also, been, linked, to, the, crucifixion, of, christ, with, author, and, scientist, charles, panati, noting, that, many, believe, a, ladder, rested, against, the, cross, that, christ, hung, from, making, it, a, symbol, of, wickedness, betrayal, and, death, in, comedic, children, s, media, the, image, of, a, character, walking, under, a, ladder, being, the, cause, or, result, of, bad, luck, has, become, a, common, trope
