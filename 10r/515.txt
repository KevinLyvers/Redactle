https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonet
a, bayonet, from, old, french, bayonette, now, spelt, ba, onnette, is, a, knife, dagger, sword, or, spike, shaped, melee, weapon, designed, to, be, mounted, on, the, end, of, the, barrel, of, a, rifle, carbine, musket, or, similar, long, firearm, allowing, the, gun, to, be, used, as, an, improvised, spear, in, close, combats, the, term, is, derived, from, the, town, of, bayonne, in, southwestern, france, where, bayonets, were, supposedly, first, used, by, basques, in, the, 17th, century, from, the, early, 17th, to, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, an, infantry, melee, weapon, used, for, both, offensive, and, or, defensive, tactics, usually, when, charging, in, mass, formations, or, human, wave, attacks, today, it, is, mostly, considered, an, ancillary, weapon, usually, of, last, resort, and, is, rarely, used, if, wielded, at, all, although, it, is, still, displayed, routinely, for, ceremonial, purposes, the, term, bayonette, itself, dates, back, to, the, 16th, century, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, bayonets, at, the, time, were, knives, that, could, be, fitted, to, the, ends, of, firearms, or, simply, a, type, of, knife, for, example, cotgrave, s, 1611, dictionarie, describes, the, bayonet, as, a, kind, of, small, flat, pocket, dagger, furnished, with, knives, or, a, great, knife, to, hang, at, the, girdle, likewise, pierre, borel, wrote, in, 1655, that, a, kind, of, long, knife, called, a, bayonette, was, made, in, bayonne, but, does, not, give, any, further, description, there, are, some, accounts, that, place, the, invention, of, the, bayonet, in, either, france, or, germany, as, early, as, 1570, the, first, recorded, instance, of, a, bayonet, proper, is, found, in, the, chinese, military, treatise, binglu, published, in, 1606, it, was, in, the, form, of, the, son, and, mother, gun, a, breech, loading, musket, that, was, issued, with, a, roughly, 57, 6, cm, 22, 7, in, long, plug, bayonet, giving, it, an, overall, length, of, 1, 92, m, 6, ft, 4, in, with, the, bayonet, attached, it, was, labelled, as, a, gun, blade, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, ch, ngd, o, with, it, being, described, as, a, short, sword, that, can, be, inserted, into, the, barrel, and, secured, by, twisting, it, slightly, that, it, is, to, be, used, when, the, battle, have, depleted, both, gunpowder, and, bullets, as, well, as, fighting, against, bandits, when, forces, are, closing, into, melee, or, encountering, an, ambush, and, if, one, cannot, load, the, gun, within, the, time, it, takes, to, cover, two, bu, 3, 2, meters, of, ground, they, are, to, attach, the, bayonet, and, hold, it, like, a, spear, early, bayonets, were, of, the, plug, type, where, the, bayonet, was, fitted, directly, into, the, barrel, of, the, musket, this, allowed, light, infantry, to, be, converted, to, heavy, infantry, and, hold, off, cavalry, charges, the, bayonet, had, a, round, handle, that, slid, directly, into, the, musket, barrel, this, naturally, prevented, the, gun, from, being, fired, the, first, known, mention, of, the, use, of, bayonets, in, european, warfare, was, in, the, memoirs, of, jacques, de, chastenet, vicomte, de, puys, gur, he, described, the, french, using, crude, 1, foot, 0, 30, m, plug, bayonets, during, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, however, it, was, not, until, 1671, that, general, jean, martinet, standardized, and, issued, plug, bayonets, to, the, french, regiment, of, fusiliers, then, raised, they, were, issued, to, part, of, an, english, dragoon, regiment, raised, in, 1672, and, to, the, royal, fusiliers, when, raised, in, 1685, the, major, problem, with, plug, bayonets, was, that, when, attached, they, made, it, impossible, to, fire, the, musket, requiring, soldiers, to, wait, until, the, last, possible, moment, before, a, melee, to, fix, the, bayonet, the, defeat, of, forces, loyal, to, william, of, orange, by, jacobite, highlanders, at, the, battle, of, killiecrankie, in, 1689, was, due, among, other, things, to, the, use, of, the, plug, bayonet, the, highlanders, closed, to, 50, yd, 46, m, fired, a, single, volley, dropped, their, muskets, and, using, axes, and, swords, quickly, overwhelmed, the, loyalists, before, they, had, time, to, fix, bayonets, shortly, thereafter, the, defeated, leader, hugh, mackay, is, believed, to, have, introduced, a, socket, bayonet, of, his, own, invention, soon, socket, bayonets, would, incorporate, both, socket, mounts, and, an, offset, blade, that, fit, around, the, musket, s, barrel, which, allowed, the, musket, to, be, fired, and, reloaded, while, the, bayonet, was, attached, an, unsuccessful, trial, with, socket, or, zigzag, bayonets, was, made, after, the, battle, of, fleurus, in, 1690, in, the, presence, of, king, louis, xiv, who, refused, to, adopt, them, as, they, had, a, tendency, to, fall, off, the, musket, shortly, after, the, peace, of, ryswick, 1697, the, english, and, germans, abolished, the, pike, and, introduced, socket, bayonets, the, british, socket, bayonet, had, a, spike, with, a, triangular, cross, section, rather, than, a, flat, blade, with, a, flat, side, towards, the, muzzle, and, two, fluted, sides, outermost, to, a, length, of, 15, inches, 38, cm, it, had, no, lock, to, keep, it, fast, to, the, muzzle, and, was, well, documented, for, falling, off, in, the, heat, of, battle, by, the, mid, 18th, century, socket, bayonets, had, been, adopted, by, most, european, armies, in, 1703, the, french, infantry, adopted, a, spring, loaded, locking, system, that, prevented, the, bayonet, from, accidentally, separating, from, the, musket, a, triangular, blade, was, introduced, around, 1715, and, was, stronger, than, the, previous, single, or, double, edged, model, the, 18th, century, introduced, the, concept, of, the, sword, bayonet, a, long, bladed, weapon, with, a, single, or, double, edged, blade, that, could, also, be, used, as, a, shortsword, its, initial, purpose, was, to, ensure, that, riflemen, could, form, an, infantry, square, properly, to, fend, off, cavalry, attacks, when, in, ranks, with, musketmen, whose, weapons, were, longer, a, prime, early, example, of, a, sword, bayonet, fitted, rifle, is, the, pattern, 1800, infantry, rifle, later, known, as, the, baker, rifle, sword, bayonets, were, used, by, german, jagers, in, the, 18th, century, the, hilt, usually, had, quillons, modified, to, accommodate, the, gun, barrel, and, a, hilt, mechanism, that, enabled, the, bayonet, to, be, attached, to, a, bayonet, lug, a, sword, bayonet, could, be, used, in, combat, as, a, sidearm, when, detached, from, the, musket, or, rifle, when, the, bayonet, was, attached, to, the, musket, or, rifle, it, effectively, turned, all, long, guns, into, a, spear, or, glaive, which, made, it, suitable, for, both, thrusting, and, cutting, attacks, while, the, british, army, eventually, discarded, the, sword, bayonet, the, socket, bayonet, survived, the, introduction, of, the, rifled, musket, into, british, service, in, 1854, the, new, rifled, musket, copied, the, french, locking, ring, system, the, new, bayonet, proved, its, worth, at, the, battle, of, alma, and, the, battle, of, inkerman, during, the, crimean, war, where, the, imperial, russian, army, learned, to, fear, it, in, the, 1860s, european, nations, began, to, develop, new, bolt, action, breechloading, rifles, such, as, the, chassepot, and, snider, enfield, and, sword, bayonets, suitable, for, mass, production, and, used, by, police, pioneer, and, engineer, troops, the, decision, to, redesign, the, bayonet, into, a, short, sword, was, viewed, by, some, as, an, acknowledgement, of, the, decline, in, importance, of, the, fixed, bayonet, as, a, weapon, in, the, face, of, new, advances, in, firearms, technology, as, a, british, newspaper, put, it, the, committee, in, recommending, this, new, sword, bayonet, appear, to, have, had, in, view, the, fact, that, bayonets, will, henceforth, be, less, frequently, used, than, in, former, times, as, a, weapon, of, offence, and, defence, they, desired, therefore, to, substitute, an, instrument, of, more, general, utility, one, of, these, multipurpose, designs, was, the, sawback, bayonet, which, incorporated, saw, teeth, on, the, spine, of, the, blade, the, sawback, bayonet, was, intended, for, use, as, a, general, purpose, utility, tool, as, well, as, a, weapon, the, teeth, were, meant, to, facilitate, the, cutting, of, wood, for, various, defensive, works, such, as, barbed, wire, posts, as, well, as, for, butchering, livestock, it, was, initially, adopted, by, the, german, states, in, 1865, until, the, middle, of, wwi, approximately, 5, of, every, bayonet, style, was, complemented, with, a, sawback, version, for, example, in, belgium, in, 1868, great, britain, in, 1869, and, switzerland, in, 1878, switzerland, introduced, their, last, model, in, 1914, the, original, sawback, bayonets, were, typically, of, the, heavy, sword, type, they, were, issued, to, engineers, with, to, some, extent, the, bayonet, aspect, being, secondary, to, the, tool, aspect, later, german, sawbacks, were, more, of, a, rank, indicator, than, a, functional, saw, the, sawback, proved, relatively, ineffective, as, a, cutting, tool, and, was, soon, outmoded, by, improvements, in, military, logistics, and, transportation, most, nations, dropped, the, sawback, feature, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, german, army, discontinued, use, of, the, sawback, bayonet, in, 1917, after, protests, that, the, serrated, blade, caused, unnecessarily, severe, wounds, when, used, as, a, fixed, bayonet, the, trowel, or, spade, bayonet, was, another, multipurpose, design, intended, for, use, both, as, an, offensive, weapon, as, well, as, a, digging, tool, for, excavating, entrenchments, in, 1870, the, us, army, issued, trowel, bayonets, to, infantry, regiments, based, on, a, design, by, lieutenant, colonel, edmund, rice, a, us, army, officer, and, civil, war, veteran, which, were, manufactured, by, the, springfield, armory, besides, its, utility, as, both, a, fixed, bayonet, and, a, digging, implement, the, rice, trowel, bayonet, could, be, used, to, plaster, log, huts, and, stone, chimneys, for, winter, quarters, sharpened, on, one, edge, it, could, cut, tent, poles, and, pins, ten, thousand, were, eventually, issued, and, the, design, saw, service, during, the, 1877, nez, perce, campaign, rice, was, given, leave, in, 1877, to, demonstrate, his, trowel, bayonet, to, several, nations, in, europe, one, infantry, officer, recommended, it, to, the, exclusion, of, all, other, designs, noting, that, the, entrenching, tools, of, an, army, rarely, get, up, to, the, front, until, the, exigency, for, their, use, has, passed, the, rice, trowel, bayonet, was, declared, obsolete, by, the, us, army, in, december, 1881, prior, to, world, war, i, bayonet, doctrine, was, largely, founded, upon, the, concept, of, reach, that, is, a, soldier, s, theoretical, ability, by, use, of, an, extremely, long, rifle, and, fixed, bayonet, to, stab, an, enemy, soldier, without, having, to, approach, within, reach, of, his, opponent, s, blade, a, combined, length, of, rifle, and, bayonet, longer, than, that, of, the, enemy, infantryman, s, rifle, and, attached, bayonet, like, the, infantryman, s, pike, of, bygone, days, was, thought, to, impart, a, tactical, advantage, on, the, battlefield, in, 1886, the, french, army, introduced, a, 52, centimetre, long, 20, 5, in, quadrangular, p, e, spike, for, the, bayonet, of, the, lebel, model, 1886, rifle, the, p, e, ba, onnette, mod, le, 1886, resulting, in, a, rifle, and, bayonet, with, an, overall, length, of, six, feet, 1, 8, m, germany, responded, by, introducing, a, long, sword, bayonet, for, the, model, 1898, mauser, rifle, which, had, a, 29, inch, barrel, the, bayonet, the, seitengewehr, 98, had, a, 50, cm, 19, 7, inch, blade, with, an, overall, length, of, 5, feet, 9, inches, 1, 75, m, the, german, army, s, rifle, bayonet, combination, was, second, only, to, the, french, lebel, for, overall, reach, after, 1900, switzerland, britain, and, the, united, states, adopted, rifles, with, barrel, lengths, shorter, than, that, of, a, rifled, musket, but, longer, than, that, of, a, carbine, these, were, intended, for, general, use, by, infantry, and, cavalry, the, reach, of, the, new, short, rifles, with, attached, bayonets, was, reduced, britain, introduced, the, smle, short, magazine, lee, enfield, in, 1904, the, german, m1898, mauser, rifle, and, attached, sword, bayonet, was, 20, cm, eight, inches, longer, than, the, smle, and, its, p1903, bayonet, which, used, a, twelve, inch, 30, cm, blade, while, the, british, p1903, and, its, similar, predecessor, the, p1888, was, satisfactory, in, service, criticism, soon, arose, regarding, the, shortened, reach, one, military, writer, of, the, day, warned, the, german, soldier, has, eight, inches, the, better, of, the, argument, over, the, british, soldier, when, it, comes, to, crossing, bayonets, and, the, extra, eight, inches, easily, turns, the, battle, in, favour, of, the, longer, if, both, men, are, of, equal, skill, in, 1905, the, german, army, adopted, a, shortened, 37, centimetre, long, 14, 5, in, bayonet, the, seitengewehr, 98, 06, for, engineer, and, pioneer, troops, and, in, 1908, a, short, rifle, as, well, the, karabiner, model, 1898az, which, was, produced, in, limited, quantities, for, the, cavalry, artillery, and, other, specialist, troops, however, the, long, barreled, 98, mauser, rifle, remained, in, service, as, the, primary, infantry, small, arm, moreover, german, military, authorities, continued, to, promote, the, idea, of, outreaching, one, s, opponent, on, the, battlefield, by, means, of, a, longer, rifle, bayonet, combination, a, concept, prominently, featured, in, its, infantry, bayonet, training, doctrines, these, included, the, throw, point, or, extended, thrust, and, lunge, attack, using, this, tactic, the, german, soldier, dropped, into, a, half, crouch, with, the, rifle, and, fixed, bayonet, held, close, to, the, body, in, this, position, the, soldier, next, propelled, his, rifle, forward, then, dropped, the, supporting, hand, while, taking, a, step, forward, with, the, right, foot, simultaneously, thrusting, out, the, right, arm, to, full, length, with, the, extended, rifle, held, in, the, grip, of, the, right, hand, alone, with, a, maximum, kill, zone, of, some, eleven, feet, the, throw, point, bayonet, attack, gave, an, impressive, increase, in, reach, and, was, later, adopted, by, other, military, forces, including, the, u, s, army, in, response, to, criticism, over, the, reduced, reach, of, the, smle, rifle, and, bayonet, british, ordnance, authorities, introduced, the, p1907, bayonet, in, 1908, which, had, an, elongated, blade, of, some, seventeen, inches, to, compensate, for, the, reduced, overall, length, of, the, smle, rifle, the, 1907, bayonet, was, essentially, a, copy, of, the, japanese, type, 30, bayonet, britain, having, purchased, a, number, of, japanese, type, 30, rifles, for, the, royal, navy, during, the, preceding, years, u, s, authorities, in, turn, adopted, a, long, 16, in, blade, bayonet, for, the, m1903, springfield, short, rifle, the, m1905, bayonet, later, a, long, sword, bayonet, was, also, provided, for, the, m1917, enfield, rifle, the, experience, of, world, war, i, reversed, opinion, on, the, value, of, long, rifles, and, bayonets, in, typical, infantry, combat, operations, whether, in, the, close, confines, of, trench, warfare, night, time, raiding, and, patrolling, or, attacking, across, open, ground, soldiers, of, both, sides, soon, recognized, the, inherent, limitations, of, a, long, and, ungainly, rifle, and, bayonet, when, used, as, a, close, quarters, battle, weapon, once, allied, soldiers, had, been, trained, to, expect, the, throw, point, or, extended, thrust, and, lunge, attack, the, method, lost, most, of, its, tactical, value, on, the, world, war, i, battlefield, it, required, a, strong, arm, and, wrist, was, very, slow, to, recover, if, the, initial, thrust, missed, its, mark, and, was, easily, parried, by, a, soldier, who, was, trained, to, expect, it, thus, exposing, the, german, soldier, to, a, return, thrust, which, he, could, not, easily, block, or, parry, instead, of, longer, bayonets, infantry, forces, on, both, sides, began, experimenting, with, other, weapons, as, auxiliary, close, quarter, arms, including, the, trench, knife, trench, club, handgun, hand, grenade, and, entrenching, tool, soldiers, soon, began, employing, the, bayonet, as, a, knife, as, well, as, an, attachment, for, the, rifle, and, bayonets, were, often, shortened, officially, or, unofficially, to, make, them, more, versatile, and, easier, to, use, as, tools, or, to, maneuver, in, close, quarters, during, world, war, ii, bayonets, were, further, shortened, into, knife, sized, weapons, in, order, to, give, them, additional, utility, as, fighting, or, utility, knives, the, vast, majority, of, modern, bayonets, introduced, since, world, war, ii, are, of, the, knife, bayonet, type, the, development, of, the, bayonet, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, led, to, the, bayonet, charge, becoming, the, main, infantry, tactic, throughout, the, 18th, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, as, early, as, the, 19th, century, military, scholars, were, already, noting, that, most, bayonet, charges, did, not, result, in, close, combat, instead, one, side, usually, fled, before, actual, bayonet, fighting, ensued, the, act, of, fixing, bayonets, has, been, held, to, be, primarily, connected, to, morale, the, making, of, a, clear, signal, to, friend, and, foe, of, a, willingness, to, kill, at, close, quarters, the, bayonet, charge, was, above, all, a, tool, of, shock, while, charges, were, reasonably, common, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, warfare, actual, combat, between, formations, with, their, bayonets, was, so, rare, as, to, be, effectively, nonexistent, usually, a, charge, would, only, happen, after, a, long, exchange, of, gunfire, and, one, side, would, break, and, run, before, contact, was, actually, made, sir, charles, oman, nearing, the, end, of, his, history, of, the, peninsular, war, 1807, 1814, in, which, he, had, closely, studied, hundreds, of, battles, and, combats, only, discovered, a, single, example, of, in, his, words, one, of, the, rarest, things, in, the, peninsular, war, a, real, hand, to, hand, fight, with, the, white, weapon, infantry, melees, were, much, more, common, in, close, country, towns, villages, earthworks, and, other, terrain, which, reduced, visibility, to, such, ranges, that, hand, to, hand, fighting, was, unavoidable, these, melees, however, were, not, bayonet, charges, per, se, as, they, were, not, executed, or, defended, against, by, regular, bodies, of, orderly, infantry, rather, they, were, a, chaotic, series, of, individual, combats, where, musket, butts, and, fists, were, used, alongside, bayonets, swords, and, polearms, the, bayonet, charge, was, a, common, tactic, used, during, the, napoleonic, wars, despite, its, effectiveness, a, bayonet, charge, did, not, necessarily, cause, substantial, casualties, through, the, use, of, the, weapon, itself, detailed, battle, casualty, lists, from, the, 18th, century, showed, that, in, many, battles, less, than, 2, of, all, wounds, treated, were, caused, by, bayonets, antoine, henri, jomini, a, celebrated, military, author, who, served, in, numerous, armies, during, the, napoleonic, period, stated, that, the, majority, of, bayonet, charges, in, the, open, resulted, with, one, side, fleeing, before, any, contact, was, made, combat, with, bayonets, did, occur, but, mostly, on, a, small, scale, when, units, of, opposing, sides, encountered, each, other, in, a, confined, environment, such, as, during, the, storming, of, fortifications, or, during, ambush, skirmishes, in, broken, terrain, in, an, age, of, fire, by, massed, volley, when, compared, to, random, unseen, bullets, the, threat, of, the, bayonet, was, much, more, tangible, and, immediate, guaranteed, to, lead, to, a, personal, gruesome, conclusion, if, both, sides, persisted, all, this, encouraged, men, to, flee, before, the, lines, met, thus, the, bayonet, was, an, immensely, useful, weapon, for, capturing, ground, from, the, enemy, despite, seldom, actually, being, used, to, inflict, wounds, during, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, the, bayonet, was, found, to, be, responsible, for, less, than, 1, of, battlefield, casualties, a, hallmark, of, modern, warfare, the, use, of, bayonet, charges, to, force, the, enemy, to, retreat, was, very, successful, in, numerous, small, unit, engagements, at, short, range, in, the, american, civil, war, as, most, troops, would, retreat, when, charged, while, reloading, although, such, charges, inflicted, few, casualties, they, often, decided, short, engagements, and, tactical, possession, of, important, defensive, ground, features, additionally, bayonet, drill, could, be, used, to, rally, men, temporarily, unnerved, by, enemy, fire, while, the, overall, battle, of, gettysburg, was, won, by, the, union, armies, due, to, a, combination, of, terrain, and, massed, artillery, fire, a, decisive, point, on, the, second, day, of, the, battle, hinged, on, a, bayonet, charge, at, little, round, top, when, joshua, lawrence, chamberlain, s, 20th, maine, volunteer, infantry, regiment, running, short, of, musket, ammunition, charged, downhill, surprising, and, capturing, many, of, the, surviving, soldiers, of, the, 15th, alabama, infantry, regiment, and, other, confederate, regiments, other, bayonet, charges, occurred, at, gettysburg, such, as, that, of, the, 1st, minnesota, infantry, regiment, this, was, ordered, in, desperation, by, general, hancock, earlier, on, july, 2, in, order, to, delay, a, confederate, brigade, s, advance, long, enough, to, bring, up, reinforcements, for, the, holed, union, line, on, cemetery, ridge, still, another, bayonet, charge, was, conducted, late, in, the, evening, on, july, 2, by, the, 137th, new, york, infantry, regiment, defending, the, extreme, right, flank, of, the, union, line, on, culp, s, hill, the, charge, of, several, companies, managed, to, temporarily, stall, the, advance, of, the, 10th, virginia, infantry, regiment, long, enough, for, the, 14th, brooklyn, to, move, in, on, the, 137th, s, right, and, repel, the, attack, the, popular, image, of, world, war, i, combat, is, of, a, wave, of, soldiers, with, bayonets, fixed, going, over, the, top, and, charging, across, no, man, s, land, into, a, hail, of, enemy, fire, although, this, was, the, standard, method, of, fighting, early, in, the, war, it, was, rarely, successful, british, casualties, on, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, the, somme, were, the, worst, in, the, history, of, the, british, army, with, 57, 470, british, casualties, 19, 240, of, whom, were, killed, during, world, war, i, no, man, s, land, was, often, hundreds, of, yards, across, the, area, was, usually, devastated, by, the, warfare, and, riddled, with, craters, from, artillery, and, mortar, shells, and, sometimes, contaminated, by, chemical, weapons, heavily, defended, by, machine, guns, mortars, artillery, and, riflemen, on, both, sides, it, was, often, covered, with, barbed, wire, and, land, mines, and, littered, with, the, rotting, corpses, of, those, who, were, not, able, to, make, it, across, the, sea, of, projectiles, explosions, and, flames, a, bayonet, charge, through, no, man, s, land, often, resulted, in, the, total, annihilation, of, entire, battalions, the, advent, of, modern, warfare, in, the, 20th, century, made, bayonet, charges, dubious, affairs, during, the, siege, of, port, arthur, 1904, 1905, the, japanese, used, human, wave, attacks, against, russian, artillery, and, machine, guns, suffering, massive, casualties, however, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, the, japanese, were, able, to, use, bayonet, charges, effectively, against, poorly, organized, and, lightly, armed, chinese, troops, banzai, charges, became, an, accepted, military, tactic, where, japanese, forces, were, able, to, rout, larger, chinese, forces, routinely, in, the, early, stages, of, the, pacific, war, 1941, 1945, a, sudden, bayonet, charge, could, overwhelm, unprepared, enemy, soldiers, such, charges, became, known, to, allied, forces, as, banzai, charges, from, the, japanese, battle, cry, by, the, end, of, the, war, against, well, organized, and, heavily, armed, allied, forces, a, banzai, charge, inflicted, little, damage, but, at, high, cost, they, were, sometimes, conducted, as, a, last, resort, by, small, groups, of,

point, until, a, breach, was, created, once, penetration, was, achieved, the, bulk, of, the, chinese, forces, would, move, into, the, enemy, rear, and, attack, from, behind, due, to, primitive,
