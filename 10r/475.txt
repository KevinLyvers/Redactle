in, chemistry, dialysis, is, the, process, of, separating, molecules, in, solution, by, the, difference, in, their, rates, of, diffusion, through, a, semipermeable, membrane, such, as, dialysis, tubing, dialysis, is, a, common, laboratory, technique, that, operates, on, the, same, principle, as, medical, dialysis, in, the, context, of, life, science, research, the, most, common, application, of, dialysis, is, for, the, removal, of, unwanted, small, molecules, such, as, salts, reducing, agents, or, dyes, from, larger, macromolecules, such, as, proteins, dna, or, polysaccharides, dialysis, is, also, commonly, used, for, buffer, exchange, and, drug, binding, studies, the, concept, of, dialysis, was, introduced, in, 1861, by, the, scottish, chemist, thomas, graham, he, used, this, technique, to, separate, sucrose, small, molecule, and, gum, arabic, solutes, large, molecule, in, aqueous, solution, he, called, the, diffusible, solutes, crystalloids, and, those, that, would, not, pass, the, membrane, colloids, from, this, concept, dialysis, can, be, defined, as, a, spontaneous, separation, process, of, suspended, colloidal, particles, from, dissolved, ions, or, molecules, of, small, dimensions, through, a, semi, permeable, membrane, most, common, dialysis, membrane, are, made, of, cellulose, modified, cellulose, or, synthetic, polymer, cellulose, acetate, or, nitrocellulose, dialysis, derives, from, the, greek, through, and, to, loosen, dialysis, is, the, process, used, to, change, the, matrix, of, molecules, in, a, sample, by, differentiating, molecules, by, the, classification, of, size, it, relies, on, diffusion, which, is, the, random, thermal, movement, of, molecules, in, solution, brownian, motion, that, leads, to, the, net, movement, of, molecules, from, an, area, of, higher, concentration, to, a, lower, concentration, until, equilibrium, is, reached, due, to, the, pore, size, of, the, membrane, large, molecules, in, the, sample, cannot, pass, through, the, membrane, thereby, restricting, their, diffusion, from, the, sample, chamber, by, contrast, small, molecules, will, freely, diffuse, across, the, membrane, and, obtain, equilibrium, across, the, entire, solution, volume, thereby, changing, the, overall, concentration, of, these, molecules, in, the, sample, and, dialysate, see, dialysis, figure, at, right, osmosis, is, another, principle, that, makes, dialysis, work, during, osmosis, fluid, moves, from, areas, of, high, water, concentration, to, lower, water, concentration, across, a, semi, permeable, membrane, until, equilibrium, in, dialysis, excess, fluid, moves, from, sample, to, the, dialysate, through, a, membrane, until, the, fluid, level, is, the, same, between, sample, and, dialysate, finally, ultrafiltration, is, the, convective, flow, of, water, and, dissolved, solute, down, a, pressure, gradient, caused, by, hydrostatic, forces, or, osmotic, forces, in, dialysis, ultrafiltration, removes, molecules, of, waste, and, excess, fluids, from, sample, for, example, dialysis, occurs, when, a, sample, contained, in, a, cellulose, bag, and, is, immersed, into, a, dialysate, solution, during, dialysis, equilibrium, is, achieved, between, the, sample, and, dialysate, since, only, small, molecules, can, pass, the, cellulose, membrane, leaving, only, larger, particles, behind, once, equilibrium, is, reached, the, final, concentration, of, molecules, is, dependent, on, the, volumes, of, the, solutions, involved, and, if, the, equilibrated, dialysate, is, replaced, or, exchanged, with, fresh, dialysate, see, procedure, below, diffusion, will, further, reduce, the, concentration, of, the, small, molecules, in, the, sample, dialysis, can, be, used, to, either, introduce, or, remove, small, molecules, from, a, sample, because, small, molecules, move, freely, across, the, membrane, in, both, directions, dialysis, can, also, be, used, to, remove, salts, this, makes, dialysis, a, useful, technique, for, a, variety, of, applications, see, dialysis, tubing, for, additional, information, on, the, history, properties, and, manufacturing, of, semipermeable, membranes, used, for, dialysis, diffusion, dialysis, is, a, spontaneous, separation, process, where, the, driving, force, which, produces, the, separation, is, the, concentration, gradient, it, has, an, increase, in, entropy, and, decrease, in, gibbs, free, energy, which, means, that, it, is, thermodynamically, favorable, diffusion, dialysis, uses, anion, exchange, membranes, aem, or, cation, exchange, membranes, cem, depending, on, the, compounds, to, separate, aem, allows, the, passage, of, anions, while, it, obstructs, the, passage, of, cations, due, to, the, co, ion, rejection, and, preservation, of, electrical, neutrality, the, opposite, happens, with, cation, exchange, membranes, electrodialysis, is, a, process, of, separation, which, uses, ion, exchange, membranes, and, an, electrical, potential, as, a, driving, force, it, is, mainly, used, to, remove, ions, from, aqueous, solutions, there, are, three, electrodialysis, processes, which, are, commonly, used, donnan, dialysis, reverse, electrodialysis, and, electro, electrodialysis, these, processes, are, explained, below, donnan, dialysis, is, a, separation, process, which, is, used, to, exchange, ions, between, two, aqueous, solutions, which, are, separated, by, a, cem, or, an, aem, membrane, in, the, case, of, a, cation, exchange, membrane, separating, two, solutions, with, different, acidity, protons, h, go, through, the, membrane, to, the, less, acidic, side, this, induces, an, electrical, potential, that, will, instigate, a, flux, of, the, cations, present, in, the, less, acidic, side, to, the, more, acidic, side, the, process, will, finish, when, the, variation, of, concentration, of, h, is, the, same, order, of, magnitude, as, the, difference, of, concentration, of, the, separated, cation, reverse, electrodialysis, is, a, technology, based, on, membranes, which, gets, electricity, from, a, mixing, of, two, water, streams, with, different, salinities, it, commonly, uses, anion, exchange, membranes, aem, and, cation, exchange, membranes, cem, aems, are, used, to, allow, the, pass, of, anions, and, obstruct, the, pass, of, cations, and, cems, are, used, to, do, the, opposite, the, cations, and, anions, in, the, high, salinity, water, moves, to, the, low, salinity, water, cations, passing, through, the, cems, and, anions, through, the, aems, this, phenomenon, can, be, converted, to, electricity, electro, electrodialysis, is, an, electromembrane, process, utilizing, three, compartments, which, combines, electrodialysis, and, electrolysis, it, is, commonly, used, to, recover, acid, from, a, solution, using, aem, cem, and, electrolysis, the, three, compartments, are, separated, by, two, barriers, which, are, the, ion, exchange, membranes, the, compartment, in, the, middle, has, the, water, to, be, treated, the, compartments, located, on, the, sides, contain, clean, water, the, anions, pass, through, the, aem, while, the, cations, pass, through, the, cem, the, electricity, creates, h, in, the, anions, side, and, oh, in, the, cations, side, which, react, with, the, respective, ions, separating, molecules, in, a, solution, by, dialysis, is, a, relatively, straightforward, process, other, than, the, sample, and, dialysate, buffer, all, that, is, typically, needed, is, a, typical, dialysis, procedure, for, protein, samples, is, as, follows, the, total, volume, of, sample, and, dialysate, determine, the, final, equilibrium, concentration, of, the, small, molecules, on, both, sides, of, the, membrane, by, using, the, appropriate, volume, of, dialysate, and, multiple, exchanges, of, the, buffer, the, concentration, of, small, contaminants, within, the, sample, can, be, decreased, to, acceptable, or, negligible, levels, for, example, when, dialyzing, 1ml, of, sample, against, 200ml, of, dialysate, the, concentration, of, unwanted, dialyzable, substances, will, be, decreased, 200, fold, when, equilibrium, is, attained, following, two, additional, buffer, changes, of, 200ml, each, the, contaminant, level, in, the, sample, will, be, reduced, by, a, factor, of, 8, x, 10, 6, 200, x, 200, x, 200, although, dialyzing, a, sample, is, relatively, simple, a, universal, dialysis, procedure, for, all, applications, cannot, be, provided, due, to, the, following, variables, additionally, the, dialysis, endpoint, is, somewhat, subjective, and, application, specific, therefore, the, general, procedure, might, require, optimization, dialysis, membranes, are, produced, and, characterized, according, to, molecular, weight, cutoff, mwco, limits, while, membranes, with, mwcos, ranging, from, 1, 1, 000, 000, kda, are, commercially, available, membranes, with, mwcos, near, 10, kda, are, most, commonly, used, the, mwco, of, a, membrane, is, the, result, of, the, number, and, average, size, of, the, pores, created, during, production, of, the, dialysis, membrane, the, mwco, typically, refers, to, the, smallest, average, molecular, mass, of, a, standard, molecule, that, will, not, effectively, diffuse, across, the, membrane, during, extended, dialysis, thus, a, dialysis, membrane, with, a, 10k, mwco, will, generally, retain, greater, than, 90, of, a, protein, having, a, molecular, mass, of, at, least, 10kda, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, mwco, of, a, membrane, is, not, a, sharply, defined, value, molecules, with, mass, near, the, mwco, limit, of, the, membrane, will, diffuse, across, the, membrane, more, slowly, than, molecules, significantly, smaller, than, the, mwco, in, order, for, a, molecule, to, rapidly, diffuse, across, a, membrane, it, typically, needs, to, be, at, least, 20, to, 50, times, smaller, than, the, mwco, rating, of, a, membrane, therefore, it, is, not, practical, to, separate, a, 30kda, protein, from, a, 10kda, protein, using, dialysis, across, a, 20k, rated, dialysis, membrane, dialysis, membranes, for, laboratory, use, are, typically, made, of, a, film, of, regenerated, cellulose, or, cellulose, esters, see, reference, for, a, review, of, cellulose, membranes, and, manufacturing, dialysis, is, generally, performed, in, clipped, bags, of, dialysis, tubing, or, in, a, variety, of, formatted, dialyzers, the, choice, of, the, dialysis, set, up, used, is, largely, dependent, on, the, size, of, the, sample, and, the, preference, of, the, user, dialysis, tubing, is, the, oldest, and, generally, the, least, expensive, format, used, for, dialysis, in, the, lab, tubing, is, cut, and, sealed, with, a, clip, at, one, end, then, filled, and, sealed, with, a, clip, on, the, other, end, tubing, provides, flexibility, but, has, increased, concerns, regarding, handling, sealing, and, sample, recovery, dialysis, tubing, is, typically, supplied, either, wet, or, dry, in, rolls, or, pleated, telescoped, tubes, a, wide, variety, of, dialysis, devices, or, dialyzers, are, available, from, several, vendors, dialyzers, are, designed, for, specific, sample, volume, ranges, and, provide, greater, sample, security, and, improved, ease, of, use, and, performance, for, dialysis, experiments, over, tubing, the, most, common, preformatted, dialyzers, are, slide, a, lyzer, float, a, lyzer, and, the, pur, a, lyzer, d, tube, gebaflex, dialyzers, product, lines, dialysis, has, a, wide, range, of, applications, these, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, depending, on, the, type, of, dialysis, used, some, applications, of, the, diffusion, dialysis, are, explained, below, some, applications, of, the, electrodialysis, are, explained, below, dialysis, has, both, advantages, and, disadvantages, following, the, structure, of, the, previous, section, the, pros, and, cons, are, discussed, based, on, the, type, of, dialysis, used, advantages, and, drawbacks, of, both, diffusion, dialysis, and, electrodialysis, are, outlined, below, the, main, advantage, of, diffusion, dialysis, is, the, low, energy, consumption, of, the, unit, this, membrane, technique, operates, under, normal, pressure, and, does, not, have, a, state, change, consequently, the, energy, required, is, significantly, reduced, which, reduces, the, operating, cost, there, is, also, the, low, installation, cost, easy, operation, and, the, stability, and, reliability, of, the, process, another, advantage, is, that, diffusion, dialysis, does, not, pollute, the, environment, a, disadvantage, is, that, a, diffusion, dialyser, has, a, low, processing, capability, and, low, processing, efficiency, there, are, other, methods, such, as, electrodialysis, and, reverse, osmosis, that, can, achieve, better, efficiencies, than, diffusion, dialysis, the, main, benefit, of, electrodialysis, is, the, high, recovery, especially, in, the, water, recovery, another, advantage, is, the, fact, that, not, high, pressure, is, applied, which, implies, that, the, effect, fouling, is, not, significant, and, consequently, no, chemicals, are, required, to, fight, against, them, moreover, the, fouling, layer, is, not, compact, which, leads, to, a, higher, recovery, and, to, a, long, membrane, life, it, is, also, important, that, the, treatments, are, for, concentrations, higher, than, 70, 000, ppm, eliminating, the, concentration, limit, finally, the, energy, required, to, operate, is, low, due, to, the, non, phase, change, in, fact, it, is, lower, in, comparison, with, the, needed, in, the, multi, effect, distillation, med, and, mechanical, vapour, compression, mvc, processes, the, main, drawback, of, electrodialysis, is, the, current, density, limit, the, process, must, be, operated, at, a, lower, current, density, than, the, maximum, allowed, the, fact, is, that, at, certain, voltage, applied, the, diffusion, of, ions, through, the, membrane, are, not, linear, leading, to, water, dissociation, which, would, reduce, the, efficiency, of, the, operation, another, aspect, to, take, into, account, is, that, although, low, energy, is, required, to, operate, the, higher, the, salt, feed, concentration, is, the, higher, the, energy, needed, will, be, finally, in, the, case, of, some, products, it, must, be, considered, that, electrodialysis, does, not, remove, microorganisms, and, organic, contaminants, therefore, a, post, treatment, is, necessary
