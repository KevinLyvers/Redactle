flood, control, or, flood, mitigation, protection, or, alleviation, methods, are, used, to, reduce, or, prevent, the, detrimental, effects, of, flood, waters, flooding, can, be, caused, by, a, mix, of, both, natural, processes, such, as, extreme, weather, upstream, and, human, changes, to, waterbodies, and, runoff, flood, control, methods, can, be, either, of, the, structural, type, and, of, the, non, structural, type, structural, methods, hold, back, floodwaters, physically, while, non, structural, methods, do, not, building, hard, infrastructure, to, prevent, flooding, such, as, flood, walls, is, effective, at, managing, flooding, however, best, practice, within, landscape, engineering, is, more, and, more, to, rely, on, soft, infrastructure, and, natural, systems, such, as, marshes, and, flood, plains, for, handling, the, increase, in, water, to, prevent, or, manage, coastal, flooding, coastal, management, practices, have, to, handle, natural, processes, like, tides, but, also, sea, level, rise, due, to, climate, change, flood, control, is, an, important, part, of, climate, change, adaptation, and, climate, resilience, flood, control, is, part, of, environmental, engineering, it, involves, the, management, of, flood, water, movement, such, as, redirecting, flood, run, off, through, the, use, of, floodwalls, and, flood, gates, rather, than, trying, to, prevent, floods, altogether, it, also, involves, the, management, of, people, through, measures, such, as, evacuation, and, flood, proofing, properties, the, prevention, and, mitigation, of, flooding, can, be, studied, on, three, levels, on, individual, properties, small, communities, and, whole, towns, or, cities, there, are, a, number, of, similar, terms, that, are, all, used, interchangeably, flood, control, flood, mitigation, flood, protection, and, flood, alleviation, are, all, terms, that, mean, the, detention, and, or, diversion, of, water, during, flood, events, for, the, purpose, of, reducing, discharge, or, downstream, inundation, they, include, methods, that, are, used, to, reduce, or, prevent, the, detrimental, effects, of, flood, waters, a, distinction, is, made, between, structural, and, non, structural, flood, mitigation, flood, management, or, flood, risk, management, is, a, broader, term, that, includes, mitigating, and, preparing, for, flooding, disasters, and, providing, risk, analysis, for, example, through, the, practice, of, flood, risk, assessment, in, the, context, of, natural, hazards, and, disasters, risk, management, involves, plans, actions, strategies, or, policies, to, reduce, the, likelihood, and, or, magnitude, of, adverse, potential, consequences, based, on, assessed, or, perceived, risks, flood, relief, methods, are, used, to, reduce, the, effects, of, flood, waters, or, high, water, levels, floods, are, caused, by, many, factors, or, a, combination, of, any, of, these, generally, prolonged, heavy, rainfall, locally, concentrated, or, throughout, a, catchment, area, highly, accelerated, snowmelt, severe, winds, over, water, unusual, high, tides, tsunamis, or, failure, of, dams, levees, retention, ponds, or, other, structures, that, retained, the, water, flooding, can, be, exacerbated, by, increased, amounts, of, impervious, surface, or, by, other, natural, hazards, such, as, wildfires, which, reduce, the, supply, of, vegetation, that, can, absorb, rainfall, during, times, of, rain, some, of, the, water, is, retained, in, ponds, or, soil, some, is, absorbed, by, grass, and, vegetation, some, evaporates, and, the, rest, travels, over, the, land, as, surface, runoff, floods, occur, when, ponds, lakes, riverbeds, soil, and, vegetation, cannot, absorb, all, the, water, flooding, has, many, impacts, it, damages, property, and, endangers, the, lives, of, humans, and, other, species, rapid, water, runoff, causes, soil, erosion, and, concomitant, sediment, deposition, elsewhere, such, as, further, downstream, or, down, a, coast, the, spawning, grounds, for, fish, and, other, wildlife, habitats, can, become, polluted, or, completely, destroyed, some, prolonged, high, floods, can, delay, traffic, in, areas, which, lack, elevated, roadways, floods, can, interfere, with, drainage, and, economical, use, of, lands, such, as, interfering, with, farming, structural, damage, can, occur, in, bridge, abutments, bank, lines, sewer, lines, and, other, structures, within, floodways, waterway, navigation, and, hydroelectric, power, are, often, impaired, financial, losses, due, to, floods, are, typically, millions, of, dollars, each, year, with, the, worst, floods, in, recent, u, s, history, having, cost, billions, of, dollars, property, owners, may, fit, their, homes, to, stop, water, entering, by, blocking, doors, and, air, vents, waterproofing, important, areas, and, sandbagging, the, edges, of, the, building, private, precautionary, measures, are, increasingly, important, in, flood, risk, management, flood, mitigation, at, the, property, level, may, also, involve, preventative, measures, focused, on, the, building, site, including, scour, protection, for, shoreline, developments, improving, rainwater, in, filtration, through, the, use, of, permeable, paving, materials, and, grading, away, from, structures, and, inclusion, of, berms, wetlands, or, swales, in, the, landscape, when, more, homes, shops, and, infrastructure, are, threatened, by, the, effects, of, flooding, then, the, benefits, of, protection, are, worth, the, additional, cost, temporary, flood, defenses, can, be, constructed, in, certain, locations, which, are, prone, to, floods, and, provide, protection, from, rising, flood, waters, rivers, running, through, large, urban, developments, are, often, controlled, and, channeled, water, rising, above, a, canal, s, full, capacity, may, cause, flooding, to, spread, to, other, waterways, and, areas, of, the, community, which, causes, damage, defenses, both, long, term, and, short, term, can, be, constructed, to, minimize, damage, which, involves, raising, the, edge, of, the, water, with, levees, embankments, or, walls, the, high, population, and, value, of, infrastructure, at, risk, often, justifies, the, high, cost, of, mitigation, in, larger, urban, areas, the, most, effective, way, of, reducing, the, risk, to, people, and, property, is, through, the, production, of, flood, risk, maps, most, countries, have, produced, maps, which, show, areas, prone, to, flooding, based, on, flood, data, in, the, uk, the, environment, agency, has, produced, maps, which, show, areas, at, risk, the, map, to, the, right, shows, a, flood, map, for, the, city, of, york, including, the, floodplain, for, a, 1, in, 100, year, flood, dark, blue, the, predicted, floodplain, for, a, 1, in, 1000, year, flood, light, blue, and, low, lying, areas, in, need, of, flood, defence, purple, the, most, sustainable, way, of, reducing, risk, is, to, prevent, further, development, in, flood, prone, areas, and, old, waterways, it, is, important, for, at, risk, communities, to, develop, a, comprehensive, floodplain, management, plan, in, the, us, communities, that, participate, in, the, national, flood, insurance, program, must, agree, to, regulate, development, in, flood, prone, areas, one, way, of, reducing, the, damage, caused, by, flooding, is, to, remove, buildings, from, flood, prone, areas, leaving, them, as, parks, or, returning, them, to, wilderness, floodplain, buyout, programs, have, been, operated, in, places, like, new, jersey, both, before, and, after, hurricane, sandy, charlotte, north, carolina, and, missouri, in, the, united, states, fema, produces, flood, insurance, rate, maps, that, identify, areas, of, future, risk, enabling, local, governments, to, apply, zoning, regulations, to, prevent, or, minimize, property, damage, buildings, and, other, urban, infrastructure, can, be, designed, so, that, even, if, a, flood, does, happen, the, city, can, recover, quickly, and, costs, are, minimized, for, example, homes, can, be, put, on, stilts, electrical, and, hvac, equipment, can, be, put, on, the, roof, instead, of, in, the, basement, and, subway, entrances, and, tunnels, can, have, built, in, movable, water, barriers, new, york, city, began, a, substantial, effort, to, plan, and, build, for, flood, resilience, after, hurricane, sandy, flood, resilience, technologies, support, the, fast, recovery, of, individuals, and, communities, affected, but, their, use, remains, limited, flooding, can, occur, in, cities, or, towns, as, urban, flooding, it, can, also, take, place, by, the, sea, as, coastal, flooding, sea, level, rise, can, make, coastal, flooding, worse, in, some, areas, there, are, also, risks, of, glacial, lake, outburst, floods, there, are, many, adaptation, options, for, flooding, more, frequent, drenching, rains, may, make, it, necessary, to, increase, the, capacity, of, stormwater, systems, this, separates, stormwater, from, blackwater, so, that, overflows, in, peak, periods, do, not, contaminate, rivers, one, example, is, the, smart, tunnel, in, kuala, lumpur, some, methods, of, flood, control, have, been, practiced, since, ancient, times, these, methods, include, planting, vegetation, to, retain, extra, water, terracing, hillsides, to, slow, flow, downhill, and, the, construction, of, floodways, man, made, channels, to, divert, floodwater, other, techniques, include, the, construction, of, levees, lakes, dams, reservoirs, retention, ponds, to, hold, extra, water, during, times, of, flooding, many, dams, and, their, associated, reservoirs, are, designed, completely, or, partially, to, aid, in, flood, protection, and, control, many, large, dams, have, flood, control, reservations, in, which, the, level, of, a, reservoir, must, be, kept, below, a, certain, elevation, before, the, onset, of, the, rainy, summer, melt, season, to, allow, a, certain, amount, of, space, in, which, floodwaters, can, fill, other, beneficial, uses, of, dam, created, reservoirs, include, hydroelectric, power, generation, water, conservation, and, recreation, reservoir, and, dam, construction, and, design, is, based, upon, standards, typically, set, out, by, the, government, in, the, united, states, dam, and, reservoir, design, is, regulated, by, the, us, army, corps, of, engineers, usace, design, of, a, dam, and, reservoir, follows, guidelines, set, by, the, usace, and, covers, topics, such, as, design, flow, rates, in, consideration, to, meteorological, topographic, streamflow, and, soil, data, for, the, watershed, above, the, structure, the, term, dry, dam, refers, to, a, dam, that, serves, purely, for, flood, control, without, any, conservation, storage, e, g, mount, morris, dam, seven, oaks, dam, excess, water, can, be, used, for, groundwater, replenishment, by, diversion, onto, land, that, can, absorb, the, water, this, technique, can, reduce, the, impact, of, later, droughts, by, using, the, ground, as, a, natural, reservoir, it, is, being, used, in, california, where, orchards, and, vineyards, can, be, flooded, without, damaging, crops, or, in, other, places, wilderness, areas, have, been, re, engineered, to, act, as, floodplains, in, many, countries, rivers, are, prone, to, floods, and, are, often, carefully, managed, defenses, such, as, levees, bunds, reservoirs, and, weirs, are, used, to, prevent, rivers, from, bursting, their, banks, a, weir, also, known, as, a, lowhead, dam, is, most, often, used, to, create, millponds, but, on, the, humber, river, in, toronto, a, weir, was, built, near, raymore, drive, to, prevent, a, recurrence, of, the, flood, damage, caused, by, hurricane, hazel, in, october, 1954, the, leeds, flood, alleviation, scheme, uses, movable, weirs, which, are, lowered, during, periods, of, high, water, to, reduce, the, chances, of, flooding, upstream, two, such, weirs, the, first, in, the, uk, were, installed, on, the, river, aire, in, october, 2017, at, crown, point, leeds, city, centre, and, knostrop, the, knostrop, weir, was, operated, during, the, 2019, england, floods, they, are, designed, to, reduce, potential, flood, levels, by, up, to, one, metre, coastal, flooding, has, been, addressed, with, coastal, defenses, such, as, sea, walls, beach, nourishment, and, barrier, islands, tide, gates, are, used, in, conjunction, with, dykes, and, culverts, they, can, be, placed, at, the, mouth, of, streams, or, small, rivers, where, an, estuary, begins, or, where, tributary, streams, or, drainage, ditches, connect, to, sloughs, tide, gates, close, during, incoming, tides, to, prevent, tidal, waters, from, moving, upland, and, open, during, outgoing, tides, to, allow, waters, to, drain, out, via, the, culvert, and, into, the, estuary, side, of, the, dike, the, opening, and, closing, of, the, gates, is, driven, by, a, difference, in, water, level, on, either, side, of, the, gate, a, flood, barrier, surge, barrier, or, storm, surge, barrier, is, a, specific, type, of, floodgate, designed, to, prevent, a, storm, surge, or, spring, tide, from, flooding, the, protected, area, behind, the, barrier, a, surge, barrier, is, almost, always, part, of, a, larger, flood, protection, system, consisting, of, floodwalls, levees, also, known, as, dikes, and, other, constructions, and, natural, geographical, features, the, self, closing, flood, barrier, scfb, is, a, flood, defense, system, designed, to, protect, people, and, property, from, inland, waterway, floods, caused, by, heavy, rainfall, gales, or, rapid, melting, snow, the, scfb, can, be, built, to, protect, residential, properties, and, whole, communities, as, well, as, industrial, or, other, strategic, areas, the, barrier, system, is, constantly, ready, to, deploy, in, a, flood, situation, it, can, be, installed, in, any, length, and, uses, the, rising, flood, water, to, deploy, when, permanent, defenses, fail, emergency, measures, such, as, sandbags, or, inflatable, impermeable, sacks, are, used, in, 1988, a, method, of, using, water, to, control, flooding, was, discovered, this, was, accomplished, by, containing, 2, parallel, tubes, within, a, third, outer, tube, when, filled, this, structure, formed, a, non, rolling, wall, of, water, that, can, control, 80, percent, of, its, height, in, external, water, depth, with, dry, ground, behind, it, eight, foot, tall, water, filled, barriers, were, used, to, surround, fort, calhoun, nuclear, generating, station, during, the, 2011, missouri, river, flooding, instead, of, trucking, in, sandbag, material, for, a, flood, stacking, it, then, trucking, it, out, to, a, hazmat, disposal, site, flood, control, can, be, accomplished, by, using, the, on, site, water, however, these, are, not, fool, proof, a, 8, feet, 2, 4, m, high, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, long, water, filled, rubber, flood, berm, that, surrounded, portions, of, the, plant, was, punctured, by, a, skid, steer, loader, and, it, collapsed, flooding, a, portion, of, the, facility, in, 1999, a, group, of, norwegian, engineers, patented, a, transportable, removable, and, reusable, flood, barrier, which, uses, the, water, s, weight, against, itself, this, removable, flood, panels, protect, cities, and, public, utilities, other, solutions, such, as, hydrosack, are, polypropylene, exteriors, with, wood, pulp, within, though, they, are, one, time, use, there, are, several, methods, of, non, structural, flood, control, that, form, part, of, flood, risk, management, strategies, these, can, involve, policy, that, reduces, the, amount, of, urban, structures, built, around, floodplains, or, flood, prone, areas, through, land, zoning, regulations, this, helps, to, reduce, the, amount, of, mitigation, needed, to, protect, humans, and, buildings, from, flooding, events, similarly, flood, warning, systems, are, important, for, reducing, risks, following, the, occurrence, of, flooding, events, other, measures, such, as, rebuilding, plans, and, insurance, can, be, integrated, into, flood, risk, management, plans, flood, risk, management, strategy, diversification, is, needed, to, ensure, that, management, strategies, cover, several, different, scenarios, and, ensure, best, practices, flood, mapping, is, a, tool, used, by, governments, and, policy, makers, to, delineate, the, borders, of, potential, flooding, events, allowing, educated, decisions, to, prevent, extreme, flooding, events, flood, maps, are, useful, to, create, documentation, that, allows, policy, makers, to, make, informed, decisions, about, flood, hazards, flood, mapping, also, provides, conceptual, models, to, both, the, public, and, private, sectors, with, information, about, flooding, hazards, flood, mapping, has, been, criticized, in, many, areas, around, the, world, due, to, the, absence, of, public, accessibility, technical, writing, and, data, and, lack, of, easy, to, understand, information, however, revived, attention, towards, flood, mapping, has, renewed, the, interest, in, enhancing, current, flood, mapping, for, use, as, a, flood, risk, management, method, flood, modelling, is, a, tool, used, to, model, flood, hazard, and, the, effects, on, humans, and, the, physical, environment, flood, modelling, takes, into, consideration, how, flood, hazards, external, and, internal, processes, and, factors, and, the, main, drivers, of, floods, interact, with, each, other, flood, modelling, combines, factors, such, as, terrain, hydrology, and, urban, topography, to, reproduce, the, evolution, of, a, flood, in, order, to, identify, the, different, levels, of, flooding, risks, associated, with, each, element, exposed, the, modelling, can, be, carried, out, using, hydraulic, models, conceptual, models, or, geomorphic, methods, nowadays, there, is, a, growing, attention, also, in, the, production, of, maps, obtained, with, remote, sensing, flood, modelling, is, helpful, for, determining, building, development, practices, and, hazard, mitigation, methods, that, reduce, the, risks, associated, with, flooding, stakeholder, engagement, is, a, useful, tool, for, flood, risk, management, that, allows, enhanced, public, engagement, for, agreements, to, be, reached, on, policy, discussions, different, management, considerations, can, be, taken, into, account, including, emergency, management, and, disaster, risk, reduction, goals, interactions, of, land, use, planning, with, the, integration, of, flood, risks, and, required, policies, in, flood, management, stakeholder, engagement, is, seen, as, an, important, way, to, achieve, greater, cohesion, and, consensus, integrating, stakeholder, engagement, into, flood, management, often, provides, a, more, complex, analysis, of, the, situation, this, generally, adds, more, demand, in, determining, collective, solutions, and, increases, the, time, it, takes, to, determine, solutions, flood, risk, management, frm, aims, to, reduce, the, human, and, socio, economic, losses, caused, by, flooding, and, is, part, of, the, larger, field, of, risk, management, flood, risk, management, analyzes, the, relationships, between, physical, systems, and, socio, economic, environments, through, flood, risk, assessment, and, tries, to, create, understanding, and, action, about, the, risks, posed, by, flooding, the, relationships, cover, a, wide, range, of, topics, from, drivers, and, natural, processes, to, models, and, socio, economic, consequences, this, relationship, examines, management, methods, which, includes, a, wide, range, of, flood, management, methods, including, but, are, not, limited, to, flood, mapping, and, physical, implication, measures, frm, looks, at, how, to, reduce, flood, risk, and, how, to, appropriately, manage, risks, that, are, associated, with, flooding, flood, risk, management, includes, mitigating, and, preparing, for, flooding, disasters, analyzing, risk, and, providing, a, risk, analysis, system, to, mitigate, the, negative, impacts, caused, by, flooding, flooding, and, flood, risk, are, especially, important, with, more, extreme, weather, and, sea, level, rise, caused, by, climate, change, as, more, areas, will, be, effected, by, flood, risk, the, costs, of, flood, protection, rise, as, more, people, and, property, are, to, be, protected, the, us, fema, for, example, estimates, that, for, every, 1, 00, spent, on, mitigation, 4, 00, is, saved, an, elaborate, system, of, flood, way, defenses, can, be, found, in, the, canadian, province, of, manitoba, the, red, river, flows, northward, from, the, united, states, passing, through, the, city, of, winnipeg, where, it, meets, the, assiniboine, river, and, into, lake, winnipeg, as, is, the, case, with, all, north, flowing, rivers, in, the, temperate, zone, of, the, northern, hemisphere, snow, melt, in, southern, sections, may, cause, river, levels, to, rise, before, northern, sections, have, had, a, chance, to, completely, thaw, this, can, lead, to, devastating, flooding, as, occurred, in, winnipeg, during, the, spring, of, 1950, to, protect, the, city, from, future, floods, the, manitoba, government, undertook, the, construction, of, a, massive, system, of, diversions, dikes, and, flood, ways, including, the, red, river, floodway, and, the, portage, diversion, the, system, kept, winnipeg, safe, during, the, 1997, flood, which, devastated, many, communities, upriver, from, winnipeg, including, grand, forks, north, dakota, and, ste, agathe, manitoba, in, the, united, states, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, is, the, lead, flood, control, agency, after, hurricane, sandy, new, york, city, s, metropolitan, transportation, authority, mta, initiated, multiple, flood, barrier, projects, to, protect, the, transit, assets, in, manhattan, in, one, case, the, mta, s, new, york, city, transit, authority, nyct, sealed, subway, entrances, in, lower, manhattan, using, a, deployable, fabric, cover, system, called, flex, gate, a, system, that, protects, the, subway, entrances, against, 14, feet, 4, 3, m, of, water, extreme, storm, flood, protection, levels, have, been, revised, based, on, new, federal, emergency, management, agency, guidelines, for, 100, year, and, 500, year, design, flood, elevations, in, the, new, orleans, metropolitan, area, 35, percent, of, which, sits, below, sea, level, is, protected, by, hundreds, of, miles, of, levees, and, flood, gates, this, system, failed, catastrophically, with, numerous, breaks, during, hurricane, katrina, 2005, in, the, city, proper, and, in, eastern, sections, of, the, metro, area, resulting, in, the, inundation, of, approximately, 50, percent, of, the, metropolitan, area, ranging, from, a, few, inches, to, twenty, feet, in, coastal, communities, the, morganza, spillway, provides, a, method, of, diverting, water, from, the, mississippi, river, when, a, river, flood, threatens, new, orleans, baton, rouge, and, other, major, cities, on, the, lower, mississippi, it, is, the, largest, of, a, system, of, spillways, and, floodways, along, the, mississippi, completed, in, 1954, the, spillway, has, been, opened, twice, in, 1973, and, in, 2011, in, an, act, of, successful, flood, prevention, the, federal, government, offered, to, buy, out, flood, prone, properties, in, the, united, states, in, order, to, prevent, repeated, disasters, after, the, 1993, flood, across, the, midwest, several, communities, accepted, and, the, government, in, partnership, with, the, state, bought, 25, 000, properties, which, they, converted, into, wetlands, these, wetlands, act, as, a, sponge, in, storms, and, in, 1995, when, the, floods, returned, the, government, did, not, have, to, expend, resources, in, those, areas, in, kyoto, japan, the, hata, clan, successfully, controlled, floods, on, the, katsura, river, in, around, 500, a, d, and, also, constructed, a, sluice, on, the, kazuno, river, in, china, flood, diversion, areas, are, rural, areas, that, are, deliberately, flooded, in, emergencies, in, order, to, protect, cities, the, consequences, of, deforestation, and, changing, land, use, on, the, risk, and, severity, of, flooding, are, subjects, of, discussion, in, assessing, the, impacts, of, himalayan, deforestation, on, the, ganges, brahmaputra, lowlands, it, was, found, that, forests, would, not, have, prevented, or, significantly, reduced, flooding, in, the, case, of, an, extreme, weather, event, however, more, general, or, overview, studies, agree, on, the, negative, impacts, that, deforestation, has, on, flood, safety, and, the, positive, effects, of, wise, land, use, and, reforestation, many, have, proposed, that, loss, of, vegetation, deforestation, will, lead, to, an, increased, risk, of, flooding, with, natural, forest, cover, the, flood, duration, should, decrease, reducing, the, rate, of, deforestation, should, improve, the, incidents, and, severity, of, floods, in, egypt, both, the, aswan, low, dam, 1902, and, the, aswan, high, dam, 1976, have, controlled, various, amounts, of, flooding, along, the, nile, river, following, the, misery, and, destruction, caused, by, the, 1910, great, flood, of, paris, the, french, government, built, a, series, of, reservoirs, called, les, grands, lacs, de, seine, or, great, lakes, which, helps, remove, pressure, from, the, seine, during, floods, especially, the, regular, winter, flooding, london, is, protected, from, flooding, by, thames, barrier, a, huge, mechanical, barrier, across, the, river, thames, which, is, raised, when, the, water, level, reaches, a, certain, point, this, project, has, been, operational, since, 1982, and, was, designed, to, protect, against, a, surge, of, water, such, as, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1953, in, 2023, it, was, found, that, over, 4, 000, flood, defence, schemes, in, england, were, almost, useless, with, many, of, them, in, areas, hit, by, storm, babet, the, saint, petersburg, dam, was, completed, in, 2008, to, protect, saint, petersburg, from, storm, surges, it, also, has, a, main, traffic, function, as, it, completes, a, ring, road, around, saint, petersburg, eleven, dams, extend, for, 25, 4, kilometres, 15, 8, mi, and, stand, 8, metres, 26, ft, above, water, level, the, netherlands, has, one, of, the, best, flood, control, systems, in, the, world, notably, through, its, construction, of, dykes, the, country, faces, high, flooding, risk, due, to, the, country, s, low, lying, landscapes, the, largest, and, most, elaborate, flood, defenses, are, referred, to, as, the, delta, works, with, the, oosterscheldekering, as, its, crowning, achievement, these, works, in, the, southwestern, part, of, the, country, were, built, in, response, to, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1953, the, dutch, had, already, built, one, of, the, world, s, largest, dams, in, the, north, of, the,
