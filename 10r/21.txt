selective, breeding, also, called, artificial, selection, is, the, process, by, which, humans, use, animal, breeding, and, plant, breeding, to, selectively, develop, particular, phenotypic, traits, characteristics, by, choosing, which, typically, animal, or, plant, males, and, females, will, sexually, reproduce, and, have, offspring, together, domesticated, animals, are, known, as, breeds, normally, bred, by, a, professional, breeder, while, domesticated, plants, are, known, as, varieties, cultigens, cultivars, or, breeds, two, purebred, animals, of, different, breeds, produce, a, crossbreed, and, crossbred, plants, are, called, hybrids, flowers, vegetables, and, fruit, trees, may, be, bred, by, amateurs, and, commercial, or, non, commercial, professionals, major, crops, are, usually, the, provenance, of, the, professionals, in, animal, breeding, artificial, selection, is, often, combined, with, techniques, such, as, inbreeding, linebreeding, and, outcrossing, in, plant, breeding, similar, methods, are, used, charles, darwin, discussed, how, selective, breeding, had, been, successful, in, producing, change, over, time, in, his, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, its, first, chapter, discusses, selective, breeding, and, domestication, of, such, animals, as, pigeons, cats, cattle, and, dogs, darwin, used, artificial, selection, as, an, analogy, to, propose, and, explain, the, theory, of, natural, selection, but, distinguished, the, latter, from, the, former, as, a, separate, process, that, is, non, directed, the, deliberate, exploitation, of, selective, breeding, to, produce, desired, results, has, become, very, common, in, agriculture, and, experimental, biology, selective, breeding, can, be, unintentional, for, example, resulting, from, the, process, of, human, cultivation, and, it, may, also, produce, unintended, desirable, or, undesirable, results, for, example, in, some, grains, an, increase, in, seed, size, may, have, resulted, from, certain, ploughing, practices, rather, than, from, the, intentional, selection, of, larger, seeds, most, likely, there, has, been, an, interdependence, between, natural, and, artificial, factors, that, have, resulted, in, plant, domestication, selective, breeding, of, both, plants, and, animals, has, been, practiced, since, early, prehistory, key, species, such, as, wheat, rice, and, dogs, have, been, significantly, different, from, their, wild, ancestors, for, millennia, and, maize, which, required, especially, large, changes, from, teosinte, its, wild, form, was, selectively, bred, in, mesoamerica, selective, breeding, was, practiced, by, the, romans, treatises, as, much, as, 2, 000, years, old, give, advice, on, selecting, animals, for, different, purposes, and, these, ancient, works, cite, still, older, authorities, such, as, mago, the, carthaginian, the, notion, of, selective, breeding, was, later, expressed, by, the, persian, muslim, polymath, abu, rayhan, biruni, in, the, 11th, century, he, noted, the, idea, in, his, book, titled, india, which, included, various, examples, the, agriculturist, selects, his, corn, letting, grow, as, much, as, he, requires, and, tearing, out, the, remainder, the, forester, leaves, those, branches, which, he, perceives, to, be, excellent, whilst, he, cuts, away, all, others, the, bees, kill, those, of, their, kind, who, only, eat, but, do, not, work, in, their, beehive, selective, breeding, was, established, as, a, scientific, practice, by, robert, bakewell, during, the, british, agricultural, revolution, in, the, 18th, century, arguably, his, most, important, breeding, program, was, with, sheep, using, native, stock, he, was, able, to, quickly, select, for, large, yet, fine, boned, sheep, with, long, lustrous, wool, the, lincoln, longwool, was, improved, by, bakewell, and, in, turn, the, lincoln, was, used, to, develop, the, subsequent, breed, named, the, new, or, dishley, leicester, it, was, hornless, and, had, a, square, meaty, body, with, straight, top, lines, these, sheep, were, exported, widely, including, to, australia, and, north, america, and, have, contributed, to, numerous, modern, breeds, despite, the, fact, that, they, fell, quickly, out, of, favor, as, market, preferences, in, meat, and, textiles, changed, bloodlines, of, these, original, new, leicesters, survive, today, as, the, english, leicester, or, leicester, longwool, which, is, primarily, kept, for, wool, production, bakewell, was, also, the, first, to, breed, cattle, to, be, used, primarily, for, beef, previously, cattle, were, first, and, foremost, kept, for, pulling, ploughs, as, oxen, but, he, crossed, long, horned, heifers, and, a, westmoreland, bull, to, eventually, create, the, dishley, longhorn, as, more, and, more, farmers, followed, his, lead, farm, animals, increased, dramatically, in, size, and, quality, in, 1700, the, average, weight, of, a, bull, sold, for, slaughter, was, 370, pounds, 168, kg, by, 1786, that, weight, had, more, than, doubled, to, 840, pounds, 381, kg, however, after, his, death, the, dishley, longhorn, was, replaced, with, short, horn, versions, he, also, bred, the, improved, black, cart, horse, which, later, became, the, shire, horse, charles, darwin, coined, the, term, selective, breeding, he, was, interested, in, the, process, as, an, illustration, of, his, proposed, wider, process, of, natural, selection, darwin, noted, that, many, domesticated, animals, and, plants, had, special, properties, that, were, developed, by, intentional, animal, and, plant, breeding, from, individuals, that, showed, desirable, characteristics, and, discouraging, the, breeding, of, individuals, with, less, desirable, characteristics, darwin, used, the, term, artificial, selection, twice, in, the, 1859, first, edition, of, his, work, on, the, origin, of, species, in, chapter, iv, natural, selection, and, in, chapter, vi, difficulties, on, theory, slow, though, the, process, of, selection, may, be, if, feeble, man, can, do, much, by, his, powers, of, artificial, selection, i, can, see, no, limit, to, the, amount, of, change, to, the, beauty, and, infinite, complexity, of, the, co, adaptations, between, all, organic, beings, one, with, another, and, with, their, physical, conditions, of, life, which, may, be, effected, in, the, long, course, of, time, by, nature, s, power, of, selection, we, are, profoundly, ignorant, of, the, causes, producing, slight, and, unimportant, variations, and, we, are, immediately, made, conscious, of, this, by, reflecting, on, the, differences, in, the, breeds, of, our, domesticated, animals, in, different, countries, more, especially, in, the, less, civilized, countries, where, there, has, been, but, little, artificial, selection, animals, with, homogeneous, appearance, behavior, and, other, characteristics, are, known, as, particular, breeds, or, pure, breeds, and, they, are, bred, through, culling, animals, with, particular, traits, and, selecting, for, further, breeding, those, with, other, traits, purebred, animals, have, a, single, recognizable, breed, and, purebreds, with, recorded, lineage, are, called, pedigreed, crossbreeds, are, a, mix, of, two, purebreds, whereas, mixed, breeds, are, a, mix, of, several, breeds, often, unknown, animal, breeding, begins, with, breeding, stock, a, group, of, animals, used, for, the, purpose, of, planned, breeding, when, individuals, are, looking, to, breed, animals, they, look, for, certain, valuable, traits, in, purebred, stock, for, a, certain, purpose, or, may, intend, to, use, some, type, of, crossbreeding, to, produce, a, new, type, of, stock, with, different, and, it, is, presumed, superior, abilities, in, a, given, area, of, endeavor, for, example, to, breed, chickens, a, breeder, typically, intends, to, receive, eggs, meat, and, new, young, birds, for, further, reproduction, thus, the, breeder, has, to, study, different, breeds, and, types, of, chickens, and, analyze, what, can, be, expected, from, a, certain, set, of, characteristics, before, he, or, she, starts, breeding, them, therefore, when, purchasing, initial, breeding, stock, the, breeder, seeks, a, group, of, birds, that, will, most, closely, fit, the, purpose, intended, purebred, breeding, aims, to, establish, and, maintain, stable, traits, that, animals, will, pass, to, the, next, generation, by, breeding, the, best, to, the, best, employing, a, certain, degree, of, inbreeding, considerable, culling, and, selection, for, superior, qualities, one, could, develop, a, bloodline, superior, in, certain, respects, to, the, original, base, stock, such, animals, can, be, recorded, with, a, breed, registry, the, organization, that, maintains, pedigrees, and, or, stud, books, however, single, trait, breeding, breeding, for, only, one, trait, over, all, others, can, be, problematic, in, one, case, mentioned, by, animal, behaviorist, temple, grandin, roosters, bred, for, fast, growth, or, heavy, muscles, did, not, know, how, to, perform, typical, rooster, courtship, dances, which, alienated, the, roosters, from, hens, and, led, the, roosters, to, kill, the, hens, after, mating, with, them, a, soviet, attempt, to, breed, lab, rats, with, higher, intelligence, led, to, cases, of, neurosis, severe, enough, to, make, the, animals, incapable, of, any, problem, solving, unless, drugs, like, phenazepam, were, used, the, observable, phenomenon, of, hybrid, vigor, stands, in, contrast, to, the, notion, of, breed, purity, however, on, the, other, hand, indiscriminate, breeding, of, crossbred, or, hybrid, animals, may, also, result, in, degradation, of, quality, studies, in, evolutionary, physiology, behavioral, genetics, and, other, areas, of, organismal, biology, have, also, made, use, of, deliberate, selective, breeding, though, longer, generation, times, and, greater, difficulty, in, breeding, can, make, these, projects, challenging, in, such, vertebrates, as, house, mice, the, process, of, plant, breeding, has, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, and, began, with, the, domestication, of, wild, plants, into, uniform, and, predictable, agricultural, cultigens, these, high, yielding, varieties, have, been, particularly, important, in, agriculture, as, crops, improved, humans, were, able, to, move, from, hunter, gatherer, style, living, to, a, mix, of, hunter, gatherer, and, agriculture, practices, although, these, higher, yielding, plants, were, derived, from, an, extremely, primitive, version, of, plant, breeding, this, form, of, agriculture, was, an, investment, that, the, people, who, grew, them, were, planting, then, could, have, a, more, varied, diet, this, meant, that, they, did, not, completely, stop, their, hunting, and, gathering, immediately, but, instead, over, time, transition, and, ultimately, favored, agriculture, originally, this, was, due, to, humans, not, wanting, to, risk, using, all, their, time, and, resources, for, their, crops, just, to, fail, which, was, promptly, called, play, farming, due, to, the, idea, of, farmers, experimenting, with, agriculture, in, addition, the, ability, for, humans, to, stay, within, one, place, for, food, and, create, permanent, settlements, made, the, process, move, along, faster, during, this, transitional, period, crops, began, to, acclimate, and, evolve, with, humans, encouraging, humans, to, invest, further, into, crops, over, time, this, reliance, on, plant, breeding, has, created, problems, as, highlighted, by, the, book, botany, of, desire, where, michael, pollan, shows, the, connection, between, basic, human, desires, through, four, different, plants, apples, for, sweetness, tulips, for, beauty, cannabis, for, intoxication, and, potatoes, for, control, in, a, form, of, reciprocal, evolution, humans, have, influenced, these, plants, as, much, as, the, plants, have, influenced, the, people, that, consume, them, is, known, as, coevolution, selective, plant, breeding, is, also, used, in, research, to, produce, transgenic, animals, that, breed, true, i, e, are, homozygous, for, artificially, inserted, or, deleted, genes, selective, breeding, in, aquaculture, holds, high, potential, for, the, genetic, improvement, of, fish, and, shellfish, for, the, process, of, production, unlike, terrestrial, livestock, the, potential, benefits, of, selective, breeding, in, aquaculture, were, not, realized, until, recently, this, is, because, high, mortality, led, to, the, selection, of, only, a, few, broodstock, causing, inbreeding, depression, which, then, forced, the, use, of, wild, broodstock, this, was, evident, in, selective, breeding, programs, for, growth, rate, which, resulted, in, slow, growth, and, high, mortality, control, of, the, reproduction, cycle, was, one, of, the, main, reasons, as, it, is, a, requisite, for, selective, breeding, programs, artificial, reproduction, was, not, achieved, because, of, the, difficulties, in, hatching, or, feeding, some, farmed, species, such, as, eel, and, yellowtail, farming, a, suspected, reason, associated, with, the, late, realization, of, success, in, selective, breeding, programs, in, aquaculture, was, the, education, of, the, concerned, people, researchers, advisory, personnel, and, fish, farmers, the, education, of, fish, biologists, paid, less, attention, to, quantitative, genetics, and, breeding, plans, another, was, the, failure, of, documentation, of, the, genetic, gains, in, successive, generations, this, in, turn, led, to, failure, in, quantifying, economic, benefits, that, successful, selective, breeding, programs, produce, documentation, of, the, genetic, changes, was, considered, important, as, they, help, in, fine, tuning, further, selection, schemes, aquaculture, species, are, reared, for, particular, traits, such, as, growth, rate, survival, rate, meat, quality, resistance, to, diseases, age, at, sexual, maturation, fecundity, shell, traits, like, shell, size, shell, color, etc, gjedrem, 1979, showed, that, selection, of, atlantic, salmon, salmo, salar, led, to, an, increase, in, body, weight, by, 30, per, generation, a, comparative, study, on, the, performance, of, select, atlantic, salmon, with, wild, fish, was, conducted, by, akvaforsk, genetics, centre, in, norway, the, traits, for, which, the, selection, was, done, included, growth, rate, feed, consumption, protein, retention, energy, retention, and, feed, conversion, efficiency, selected, fish, had, a, twice, better, growth, rate, a, 40, higher, feed, intake, and, an, increased, protein, and, energy, retention, this, led, to, an, overall, 20, better, fed, conversion, efficiency, as, compared, to, the, wild, stock, atlantic, salmon, have, also, been, selected, for, resistance, to, bacterial, and, viral, diseases, selection, was, done, to, check, resistance, to, infectious, pancreatic, necrosis, virus, ipnv, the, results, showed, 66, 6, mortality, for, low, resistant, species, whereas, the, high, resistant, species, showed, 29, 3, mortality, compared, to, wild, species, rainbow, trout, s, gairdneri, was, reported, to, show, large, improvements, in, growth, rate, after, 7, 10, generations, of, selection, kincaid, et, al, 1977, showed, that, growth, gains, by, 30, could, be, achieved, by, selectively, breeding, rainbow, trout, for, three, generations, a, 7, increase, in, growth, was, recorded, per, generation, for, rainbow, trout, by, kause, et, al, 2005, in, japan, high, resistance, to, ipnv, in, rainbow, trout, has, been, achieved, by, selectively, breeding, the, stock, resistant, strains, were, found, to, have, an, average, mortality, of, 4, 3, whereas, 96, 1, mortality, was, observed, in, a, highly, sensitive, strain, coho, salmon, oncorhynchus, kisutch, increase, in, weight, was, found, to, be, more, than, 60, after, four, generations, of, selective, breeding, in, chile, neira, et, al, 2006, conducted, experiments, on, early, spawning, dates, in, coho, salmon, after, selectively, breeding, the, fish, for, four, generations, spawning,

experiments, carried, out, in, the, ussr, used, crossings, of, broodstocks, to, increase, genetic, diversity, and, then, selected, the, species, for, traits, like, growth, rate, exterior, traits, and, viability, and, or, adaptation, to, environmental, conditions, like, variations, in, temperature, kirpichnikov, et, al, 1974, and, babouchkine, 1987, selected, carp, for, fast, growth, and, tolerance, to, cold, the, ropsha, carp, the, results, showed, a, 30, 40, to, 77, 4, improvement, of, cold, tolerance, but, did, not, provide, any, data, for, growth, rate, an, increase, in, growth, rate, was, observed, in, the, second, generation, in, vietnam, moav, and, wohlfarth, 1976, showed, positive, results, when, selecting, for, slower, growth, for, three, generations, compared, to, selecting, for, faster, growth, schaperclaus, 1962, showed, resistance, to, the, dropsy, disease, wherein, selected, lines, suffered, low, mortality, 11, 5, compared, to, unselected, 57, growth, was, seen, to, increase, by, 12, 20, in, selectively, bred, iictalurus, punctatus, more, recently, the, response, of, the, channel, catfish, to, selection, for, improved, growth, rate, was, found, to, be, approximately, 80, that, is, an, average, of, 13, per, generation, selection, for, live, weight, of, pacific, oysters, showed, improvements, ranging, from, 0, 4, to, 25, 6, compared, to, the, wild, stock, sydney, rock, oysters, saccostrea, commercialis, showed, a, 4, increase, after, one, generation, and, a, 15, increase, after, two, generations, chilean, oysters, ostrea, chilensis, selected, for, improvement, in, live, weight, and, shell, length, showed, a, 10, 13, gain, in, one, generation, bonamia, ostrea, is, a, protistan, parasite, that, causes, catastrophic, losses, nearly, 98, in, european, flat, oyster, ostrea, edulis, l, this, protistan, parasite, is, endemic, to, three, oyster, regions, in, europe, selective, breeding, programs, show, that, o, edulis, susceptibility, to, the, infection, differs, across, oyster, strains, in, europe, a, study, carried, out, by, culloty, et, al, showed, that, rossmore, oysters, in, cork, harbour, ireland, had, better, resistance, compared, to, other, irish, strains, a, selective, breeding, program, at, cork, harbour, uses, broodstock, from, 3, to, 4, year, old, survivors, and, is, further, controlled, until, a, viable, percentage, reaches, market, size, over, the, years, rossmore, oysters, have, shown, to, develop, lower, prevalence, of, b, ostreae, infection, and, percentage, mortality, ragone, calvo, et, al, 2003, selectively, bred, the, eastern, oyster, crassostrea, virginica, for, resistance, against, co, occurring, parasites, haplosporidium, nelson, msx, and, perkinsus, marinus, dermo, they, achieved, dual, resistance, to, the, disease, in, four, generations, of, selective, breeding, the, oysters, showed, higher, growth, and, survival, rates, and, low, susceptibility, to, the, infections, at, the, end, of, the, experiment, artificially, selected, c, virginica, showed, a, 34, 48, higher, survival, rate, selection, for, growth, in, penaeid, shrimps, yielded, successful, results, a, selective, breeding, program, for, litopenaeus, stylirostris, saw, an, 18, increase, in, growth, after, the, fourth, generation, and, 21, growth, after, the, fifth, generation, marsupenaeus, japonicas, showed, a, 10, 7, increase, in, growth, after, the, first, generation, argue, et, al, 2002, conducted, a, selective, breeding, program, on, the, pacific, white, shrimp, litopenaeus, vannamei, at, the, oceanic, institute, waimanalo, usa, from, 1995, to, 1998, they, reported, significant, responses, to, selection, compared, to, the, unselected, control, shrimps, after, one, generation, a, 21, increase, was, observed, in, growth, and, 18, 4, increase, in, survival, to, tsv, the, taura, syndrome, virus, tsv, causes, mortalities, of, 70, or, more, in, shrimps, c, i, oceanos, s, a, in, colombia, selected, the, survivors, of, the, disease, from, infected, ponds, and, used, them, as, parents, for, the, next, generation, they, achieved, satisfying, results, in, two, or, three, generations, wherein, survival, rates, approached, levels, before, the, outbreak, of, the, disease, the, resulting, heavy, losses, up, to, 90, caused, by, infectious, hypodermal, and, haematopoietic, necrosis, virus, ihhnv, caused, a, number, of, shrimp, farming, industries, started, to, selectively, breed, shrimps, resistant, to, this, disease, successful, outcomes, led, to, development, of, super, shrimp, a, selected, line, of, l, stylirostris, that, is, resistant, to, ihhnv, infection, tang, et, al, 2000, confirmed, this, by, showing, no, mortalities, in, ihhnv, challenged, super, shrimp, post, larvae, and, juveniles, selective, breeding, programs, for, aquatic, species, provide, better, outcomes, compared, to, terrestrial, livestock, this, higher, response, to, selection, of, aquatic, farmed, species, can, be, attributed, to, the, following, selective, breeding, in, aquaculture, provide, remarkable, economic, benefits, to, the, industry, the, primary, one, being, that, it, reduces, production, costs, due, to, faster, turnover, rates, when, selective, breeding, is, carried, out, some, characteristics, are, lost, for, others, that, may, suit, a, specific, environment, or, situation, this, is, because, of, faster, growth, rates, decreased, maintenance, rates, increased, energy, and, protein, retention, and, better, feed, efficiency, applying, genetic, improvement, programs, to, aquaculture, species, will, increase, their, productivity, thus, allowing, them, to, meet, the, increasing, demands, of, growing, populations, conversely, selective, breeding, within, aquaculture, can, create, problems, within, the, biodiversity, of, both, stock, and, wild, fish, which, can, hurt, the, industry, down, the, road, although, there, is, great, potential, to, improve, aquaculture, due, to, the, current, lack, of, domestication, it, is, essential, that, the, genetic, diversity, of, the, fish, are, preserved, through, proper, genetic, management, as, we, domesticate, these, species, it, is, not, uncommon, for, fish, to, escape, the, nets, or, pens, that, they, are, kept, in, especially, in, mass, if, these, fish, are, farmed, in, areas, they, are, not, native, to, they, may, be, able, to, establish, themselves, and, outcompete, native, populations, of, fish, and, cause, ecological, harm, as, an, invasive, species, furthermore, if, they, are, in, areas, where, the, fish, being, farmed, are, native, too, their, genetics, are, selectively, bred, rather, than, being, wild, these, farmed, fish, could, breed, with, the, natives, which, could, be, problematic, in, the, sense, that, they, would, have, been, bred, for, consumption, rather, than, by, chance, resulting, in, an, overall, decrease, in, genetic, diversity, and, rendering, local, fish, populations, less, fit, for, survival, if, proper, management, is, not, taking, place, then, the, economic, benefits, and, the, diversity, of, the, fish, species, will, falter, selective, breeding, is, a, direct, way, to, determine, if, a, specific, trait, can, evolve, in, response, to, selection, a, single, generation, method, of, breeding, is, not, as, accurate, or, direct, the, process, is, also, more, practical, and, easier, to, understand, than, sibling, analysis, selective, breeding, is, better, for, traits, such, as, physiology, and, behavior, that, are, hard, to, measure, because, it, requires, fewer, individuals, to, test, than, single, generation, testing, however, there, are, disadvantages, to, this, process, this, is, because, a, single, experiment, done, in, selective, breeding, cannot, be, used, to, assess, an, entire, group, of, genetic, variances, individual, experiments, must, be, done, for, every, individual, trait, also, due, to, the, necessity, of, selective, breeding, experiments, to, require, maintaining, the, organisms, tested, in, a, lab, or, greenhouse, it, is, impractical, to, use, this, breeding, method, on, many, organisms, controlled, mating, instances, are, difficult, to, carry, out, in, this, case, and, this, is, a, necessary, component, of, selective, breeding, additionally, selective, breeding, can, lead, to, a, variety, of, issues, including, reduction, of, genetic, diversity, or, physical, problems, the, process, of, selective, breeding, can, create, physical, issues, for, plants, or, animals, such, as, dogs, selectively, bred, for, extremely, small, sizes, dislocating, their, kneecaps, at, a, much, more, frequent, rate, then, other, dogs, an, example, in, the, plant, world, is, the, lenape, potatoes, were, selectively, bred, for, their, disease, or, pest, resistance, which, was, attributed, to, their, high, levels, of, toxic, glycoalkaloid, solanine, which, are, usually, present, only, in, small, amounts, in, potatoes, fit, for, human, consumption, when, genetic, diversity, is, lost, it, can, also, allow, for, populations, to, lack, genetic, alternatives, to, adapt, to, events, this, becomes, an, issue, of, biodiversity, because, attributes, are, so, wide, spread, they, can, result, in, mass, epidemics, as, seen, in, the, southern, corn, leaf, blight, epidemic, of, 1970, that, wiped, out, 15, of, the, united, states, corn, crop, due, to, the, wide, use, of, a, type, of, texan, corn, strain, that, was, artificially, selected, due, to, having, sterile, pollen, to, make, farming, easier, at, the, same, time, it, was, more, vulnerable, to, southern, corn, leaf, blight
