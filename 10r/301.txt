a, tower, block, high, rise, apartment, tower, residential, tower, apartment, block, block, of, flats, or, office, tower, is, a, tall, building, as, opposed, to, a, low, rise, building, and, is, defined, differently, in, terms, of, height, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, it, is, used, as, a, residential, office, building, or, other, functions, including, hotel, retail, or, with, multiple, purposes, combined, residential, high, rise, buildings, are, also, known, in, some, varieties, of, english, such, as, british, english, as, tower, blocks, and, may, be, referred, to, as, mdus, standing, for, multi, dwelling, units, a, very, tall, high, rise, building, is, referred, to, as, a, skyscraper, high, rise, buildings, became, possible, to, construct, with, the, invention, of, the, elevator, lift, and, with, less, expensive, more, abundant, building, materials, the, materials, used, for, the, structural, system, of, high, rise, buildings, are, reinforced, concrete, and, steel, most, north, american, style, skyscrapers, have, a, steel, frame, while, residential, blocks, are, usually, constructed, of, concrete, there, is, no, clear, difference, between, a, tower, block, and, a, skyscraper, although, a, building, with, forty, or, more, stories, and, taller, than, 150, metres, 490, ft, is, generally, considered, a, skyscraper, high, rise, structures, pose, particular, design, challenges, for, structural, and, geotechnical, engineers, particularly, if, situated, in, a, seismically, active, region, or, if, the, underlying, soils, have, geotechnical, risk, factors, such, as, high, compressibility, or, bay, mud, they, also, pose, serious, challenges, to, firefighters, during, emergencies, in, high, rise, structures, new, and, old, building, design, building,

evacuations, pose, significant, problems, studies, are, often, required, to, ensure, that, pedestrian, wind, comfort, and, wind, danger, concerns, are, addressed, in, order, to, allow, less, wind, exposure, to, transmit, more, daylight, to, the, ground, and, to, appear, more, slender, many, high, rises, have, a, design, with, setbacks, apartment, buildings, have, technical, and, economic, advantages, in, areas, of, high, population, density, and, have, become, a, distinctive, feature, of, housing, accommodation, in, virtually, all, densely, populated, urban, areas, around, the, world, in, contrast, with, low, rise, and, single, family, houses, apartment, blocks, accommodate, more, inhabitants, per, unit, of, area, of, land, and, decrease, the, cost, of, municipal, infrastructure, various, bodies, have, defined, high, rise, high, rise, apartment, buildings, had, already, appeared, in, antiquity, the, insulae, in, ancient, rome, and, several, other, cities, in, the, roman, empire, some, of, which, might, have, reached, up, to, ten, or, more, stories, one, reportedly, having, 200, stairs, because, of, the, destruction, caused, by, poorly, built, high, rise, insulae, collapsing, several, roman, emperors, beginning, with, augustus, r, 30, bc, 14, ad, set, limits, of, 20, 25, metres, 66, 82, ft, for, multi, story, buildings, but, met, with, limited, success, as, these, limits, were, often, ignored, despite, the, likelihood, of, taller, insulae, collapsing, the, lower, floors, were, typically, occupied, by, either, shops, or, wealthy, families, while, the, upper, stories, were, rented, out, to, the, lower, classes, surviving, oxyrhynchus, papyri, indicate, that, seven, story, buildings, even, existed, in, provincial, towns, such, as, in, third, century, ad, hermopolis, in, roman, egypt, in, arab, egypt, the, initial, capital, city, of, fustat, housed, many, high, rise, residential, buildings, some, seven, stories, tall, that, could, reportedly, accommodate, hundreds, of, people, al, muqaddasi, in, the, 10th, century, described, them, as, resembling, minarets, while, nasir, khusraw, in, the, early, 11th, century, described, some, of, them, rising, up, to, 14, stories, with, roof, gardens, on, the, top, story, complete, with, ox, drawn, water, wheels, for, irrigating, them, by, the, 16th, century, cairo, also, had, high, rise, apartment, buildings, where, the, two, lower, floors, were, for, commercial, and, storage, purposes, and, the, multiple, stories, above, them, were, rented, out, to, tenants, the, skyline, of, many, important, medieval, cities, was, dominated, by, large, numbers, of, high, rising, urban, towers, which, fulfilled, defensive, but, also, representative, purposes, the, residential, towers, of, bologna, numbered, between, 80, and, 100, at, a, time, the, largest, of, which, still, rise, to, 97, 2, m, in, florence, a, law, of, 1251, decreed, that, all, urban, buildings, should, be, reduced, to, a, height, of, less, than, 26, m, the, regulation, immediately, put, into, effect, even, medium, sized, towns, such, as, san, gimignano, are, known, to, have, featured, 72, towers, up, to, 51, m, in, height, the, hakka, people, in, southern, china, have, adopted, communal, living, structures, designed, to, be, easily, defensible, in, the, forms, of, weilongwu, and, tulou, the, latter, are, large, enclosed, and, fortified, earth, building, between, three, and, five, stories, high, and, housing, up, to, 80, families, the, oldest, still, standing, tulou, dates, back, from, the, 14th, century, high, rises, were, built, in, the, yemeni, city, of, shibam, in, the, 16th, century, the, houses, of, shibam, are, all, made, out, of, mud, bricks, but, about, five, hundred, of, them, are, tower, houses, which, rise, five, to, sixteen, stories, high, with, each, floor, having, one, or, two, apartments, this, technique, of, building, was, implemented, to, protect, residents, from, bedouin, attacks, while, shibam, has, existed, for, around, two, thousand, years, most, of, the, city, s, houses, date, from, the, 16th, century, the, city, has, the, tallest, mud, buildings, in, the, world, some, more, than, 30, meters, 100, feet, high, shibam, has, been, called, one, of, the, oldest, and, best, examples, of, urban, planning, based, on, the, principle, of, vertical, construction, or, manhattan, of, the, desert, the, engineer, s, definition, of, high, rise, buildings, comes, from, the, development, of, fire, trucks, in, the, late, 19th, century, magirus, had, shown, the, first, cogwheel, sliding, ladder, in, 1864, the, first, turntable, ladder, drawn, by, horses, was, developed, in, 1892, which, had, a, length, of, 25, meters, the, extension, ladder, was, motorized, by, magirus, in, 1904, the, definition, of, a, maximum, of, 22, meters, for, the, highest, floor, was, common, in, the, building, regulations, at, the, time, and, it, is, still, so, today, in, germany, the, common, height, for, turntable, ladders, did, later, go, to, 32, meters, 100, feet, so, that, 30, meter, is, a, common, limit, in, some, building, regulations, today, for, example, in, switzerland, any, building, that, exceeds, the, height, of, the, usual, turntable, ladders, in, a, city, must, install, additional, fire, safety, equipment, so, that, these, high, rise, buildings, have, a, different, section, in, the, building, regulations, in, the, world, the, residential, tower, block, with, its, typical, concrete, construction, is, a, familiar, feature, of, modernist, architecture, influential, examples, include, le, corbusier, s, housing, unit, his, unit, d, habitation, repeated, in, various, european, cities, starting, with, his, cit, radieuse, in, marseille, 1947, 52, constructed, of, b, ton, brut, rough, cast, concrete, as, steel, for, framework, was, unavailable, in, post, war, france, residential, tower, blocks, became, standard, in, housing, urban, populations, displaced, by, slum, clearances, and, urban, renewal, high, rise, projects, after, world, war, ii, typically, rejected, the, classical, designs, of, the, early, skyscrapers, instead, embracing, the, uniform, international, style, many, older, skyscrapers, were, redesigned, to, suit, contemporary, tastes, or, even, got, demolished, such, as, new, york, s, singer, building, once, the, world, s, tallest, skyscraper, however, with, the, movements, of, postmodernism, new, urbanism, and, new, classical, architecture, that, established, since, the, 1980s, a, more, classical, approach, came, back, to, global, skyscraper, design, that, is, popular, today, other, contemporary, styles, and, movements, in, high, rise, design, include, organic, sustainable, neo, futurist, structuralist, high, tech, deconstructivist, blob, digital, streamline, novelty, critical, regionalist, vernacular, art, deco, or, art, deco, nouveau, and, neohistorist, also, known, as, revivalist, currently, the, tallest, high, rise, apartment, building, in, the, world, is, the, central, park, tower, on, billionaires, row, in, midtown, manhattan, towering, at, 1, 550, feet, 470, m, streets, in, the, sky, is, a, style, of, architecture, that, emerged, in, britain, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, generally, built, to, replace, run, down, terraced, housing, the, new, designs, included, not, only, modern, improvements, such, as, inside, toilets, but, also, shops, and, other, community, facilities, within, high, rise, blocks, examples, of, the, buildings, and, developments, are, trellick, tower, balfron, tower, broadwater, farm, robin, hood, gardens, and, keeling, house, in, london, hunslet, grange, in, leeds, and, park, hill, sheffield, and, castlefields, and, southgate, estate, runcorn, these, were, an, attempt, to, develop, a, new, architecture, differentiated, from, earlier, large, housing, estates, such, as, quarry, hill, flats, in, leeds, alison, and, peter, smithson, were, the, architects, of, robin, hood, gardens, as, another, large, example, in, 2005, it, was, decided, to, carry, out, a, 20, year, process, of, demolition, and, replacement, of, dwellings, with, modern, houses, in, the, aylesbury, estate, in, south, london, built, in, 1970, the, hulme, crescents, in, manchester, were, the, largest, social, housing, scheme, in, europe, when, built, in, 1972, but, lasted, just, 22, years, the, crescents, had, one, of, the, worst, reputations, of, any, british, social, housing, schemes, and, were, marred, by, numerous, design, and, practical, problems, the, ideal, of, streets, in, the, sky, often, did, not, work, in, practice, unlike, an, actual, city, street, these, walkways, were, not, thoroughfares, and, often, came, to, a, dead, end, multiple, storeys, above, the, ground, they, lacked, a, regular, flow, of, passers, by, and, the, walkways, and, especially, the, stairwells, could, not, be, seen, by, anyone, elsewhere, so, there, was, no, deterrent, to, crime, and, disorder, there, were, no, eyes, on, the, street, as, advocated, by, jane, jacobs, in, her, book, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, the, unit, d, habitation, in, marseille, provides, a, more, successful, example, of, the, concept, with, the, fifth, floor, walkway, including, a, shop, and, caf, towers, in, the, park, is, a, morphology, of, modernist, high, rise, apartment, buildings, characterized, by, a, high, rise, building, surrounded, by, a, swath, of, landscaped, land, e, g, the, tower, does, not, directly, front, the, street, it, is, based, on, an, ideology, popularised, by, le, corbusier, with, the, plan, voisin, an, expansion, of, the, garden, city, movement, aimed, at, reducing, the, problem, of, urban, congestion, it, was, introduced, in, several, large, cities, across, the, world, notably, in, north, america, europe, and, australia, as, a, solution, for, housing, especially, for, public, housing, reaching, a, peak, of, popularity, in, the, 1960s, with, the, introduction, of, prefabrication, technology, by, the, early, 1970s, opposition, to, this, style, of, towers, mounted, with, many, including, urban, planners, now, referring, to, them, as, ghettos, neighbourhoods, like, st, james, town, were, originally, designed, to, house, young, swinging, single, middle, class, residents, but, the, apartments, lacked, appeal, and, the, area, quickly, became, much, poorer, from, its, early, days, of, implementation, the, concept, was, criticised, for, making, residents, feel, unsafe, including, large, empty, common, areas, dominated, by, gang, culture, and, crime, the, layout, was, criticised, for, normalising, anti, social, behaviour, and, hampering, the, efforts, of, essential, services, particularly, for, law, enforcement, the, history, of, microdistricts, as, an, urban, planning, concept, dates, back, to, the, 1920s, when, the, soviet, union, underwent, rapid, urbanization, under, the, soviet, urban, planning, ideologies, of, the, 1920s, residential, complexes, compact, territories, with, residential, dwellings, schools, shops, entertainment, facilities, and, green, spaces, started, to, prevail, in, urban, planning, practice, as, they, allowed, for, more, careful, and, efficient, planning, of, the, rapid, urban, expansion, these, complexes, were, seen, as, an, opportunity, to, build, a, collective, society, an, environment, suitable, and, necessary, for, the, new, way, of, life, residential, tower, complexes, are, common, in, asian, countries, such, as, china, india, bangladesh, indonesia, taiwan, singapore, japan, pakistan, iran, and, south, korea, as, urban, densities, are, very, high, in, singapore, and, urban, hong, kong, land, prices, are, so, high, that, a, large, portion, of, the, population, lives, in, high, rise, apartments, in, fact, over, 60, of, hong, kong, residents, live, in, apartments, many, of, them, condominiums, of, them, in, 2020, 2, 112, 138, were, identified, residents, of, public, housing, which, is, 28, of, the, total, population, sarah, williams, goldhagen, 2012, celebrated, the, work, of, innovative, architecture, firms, such, as, woha, based, in, singapore, mass, studies, based, in, seoul, amateur, architecture, studio, based, in, hangzhou, china, and, the, new, york, city, based, steven, holl, in, the, transformation, of, residential, towers, into, vertical, communities, or, vertical, cities, in, the, sky, providing, aesthetic, unusually, designed, silhouettes, on, the, skyline, comfortable, private, spaces, and, attractive, public, spaces, none, of, these, functional, handsome, and, humane, high, rise, residential, buildings, are, affordable, housing, the, 2012, pritzker, prize, was, awarded, to, chinese, architect, wang, shu, among, his, winning, designs, is, the, vertical, courtyard, apartments, six, 26, story, towers, by, his, architectural, firm, amateur, architecture, studio, built, in, hangzhou, these, towers, were, designed, to, house, two, story, apartments, in, which, every, inhabitant, would, enjoy, the, illusion, of, living, on, the, second, floor, accomplished, by, folding, concrete, floor, planes, like, bamboo, mats, claims, the, firm, so, that, every, third, story, opens, into, a, private, courtyard, in, the, larger, towers, the, two, story, units, are, stacked, slightly, askew, adding, to, the, visual, interest, of, the, variegated, fa, ades, goldhagen, 2012, housing, in, japan, includes, various, traits, coming, from, different, eras, the, word, danchi, now, either, means, an, employer, provided, housing, or, has, a, meaning, similar, to, projects, for, modern, hi, rises, there, are, two, borrowed, words, to, make, a, distinction, in, south, korea, the, tower, blocks, are, called, apartment, complex, the, first, residential, towers, began, to, be, built, after, the, korean, war, the, south, korean, government, needed, to, build, many, apartment, complexes, in, the, cities, to, be, able, to, accommodate, the, citizens, in, the, 60, years, since, as, the, population, increased, considerably, tower, blocks, have, become, more, common, this, time, however, the, new, tower, blocks, integrated, shopping, malls, parking, systems, and, other, convenient, facilities, samsung, tower, palace, in, seoul, south, korea, is, the, tallest, apartment, complex, in, asia, in, seoul, approximately, 80, percent, of, its, residents, live, in, apartment, complexes, which, comprise, 98, percent, of, recent, residential, construction, seoul, proper, is, noted, for, its, population, density, eight, times, greater, than, rome, though, less, than, manhattan, and, paris, its, metropolitan, area, is, the, densest, in, the, oecd, although, some, central, and, eastern, european, countries, during, the, interwar, period, such, as, the, second, polish, republic, already, started, building, housing, estates, that, were, considered, to, be, of, a, high, standard, for, their, time, many, of, these, structures, perished, during, the, second, world, war, in, the, eastern, bloc, tower, blocks, were, constructed, in, great, numbers, to, produce, plenty, of, cheap, accommodation, for, the, growing, postwar, populations, of, the, ussr, and, its, satellite, states, this, took, place, mostly, in, the, 1950s, 1960s, and, 1970s, though, in, the, people, s, republic, of, poland, this, process, started, even, earlier, due, to, the, severe, damages, that, polish, cities, sustained, during, world, war, ii, throughout, the, former, eastern, bloc, countries, tower, blocks, built, during, the, soviet, years, make, up, much, of, the, current, housing, estates, and, most, of, them, were, built, in, the, specific, socialist, realist, style, of, architecture, that, was, dominant, in, the, territories, east, of, the, iron, curtain, blocky, buildings, of, that, era, are, colloquially, known, as, khrushchyovka, however, there, were, also, larger, and, more, ambitious, projects, built, in, eastern, europe, at, the, time, which, have, since, become, recognisable, examples, of, post, war, modernism, such, as, the, largest, falowiec, building, in, the, przymorze, wielkie, district, of, gda, sk, with, a, length, of, 860, m, 2, 821, 52, ft, and, 1, 792, flats, it, is, the, second, longest, housing, block, in, europe, in, romania, the, mass, construction, of, standardised, housing, blocks, began, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, with, the, outskirts, of, the, cities, some, of, which, were, made, up, of, slums, construction, continued, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, under, the, systematisation, programme, of, nicolae, ceau, escu, which, consisted, largely, of, the, demolition, and, reconstruction, of, existing, villages, towns, and, cities, in, whole, or, in, part, in, order, to, build, blocks, of, flats, blocuri, as, a, result, of, increasing, urbanisation, following, an, accelerated, industrialisation, process, in, czechoslovakia, now, the, czech, republic, and, slovakia, panel, k, building, under, marxism, leninism, resulted, from, two, main, factors, the, postwar, housing, shortage, and, the, ideology, of, the, ruling, party, in, eastern, european, countries, opinions, about, these, buildings, vary, greatly, with, some, deeming, them, as, eyesores, on, their, city, s, landscape, while, others, glorify, them, as, relics, of, a, bygone, age, and, historical, examples, of, unique, architectural, styles, such, as, socialist, realism, brutalism, etc, since, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, and, especially, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, many, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, countries, have, begun, construction, of, new, more, expensive, and, modern, housing, the, r, dmie, cie, borough, of, warsaw, the, capital, of, poland, has, seen, the, development, of, an, array, of, skyscrapers, russia, is, also, currently, undergoing, a, dramatic, buildout, growing, a, commercially, shaped, skyline, moreover, the, ongoing, changes, made, to, postwar, housing, estates, since, the, 2000s, in, former, communist, countries, vary, ranging, from, simply, applying, a, new, coat, of, paint, to, the, previously, grey, exterior, to, thorough, modernisation, of, entire, buildings, in, the, european, union, among, former, warsaw, pact, states, a, majority, of, the, population, lives, in, flats, in, latvia, 65, 1, estonia, 63, 8, lithuania, 58, 4, czech, republic, 52, 8, and, slovakia, 50, 3, as, of, 2014, data, from, eurostat, however, not, all, flat, dwellers, in, eastern, europe, live, in, cold, war, era, blocks, of, flats, many, live, in, buildings, constructed, after, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, and, some, in, buildings, that, survived, world, war, ii, in, western, europe, there, are, fewer, high, rise, buildings, because, of, the, historic, city, centres, in, the, 1960s, developers, began, demolishing, older, buildings, to, replace, them, with, modern, high, rise, buildings, in, brussels, there, are, numerous, modern, high, rise, buildings, in, the, northern, quarter, business, district, the, government, of, belgium, wants, to, recreate, washington, d, c, on, a, small, scale, there, are, some, tall, residential, buildings, in, la, d, fense, district, such, as, tour, d, fense, 2000, even, though, the, district, is, mainly, commercial, this, allows, the, residents, to, walk, to, the, nearby, office, buildings, without, using, vehicles, tower, blocks, were, first, built, in, the, united, kingdom, after, the, second, world, war, and, were, seen, as, a, cheap, way, to, replace, 19th, century, urban, slums, and, war, damaged, buildings, they, were, originally, seen, as, desirable, but, quickly, fell, out, of, favour, as, tower, blocks, attracted, rising, crime, and, social, disorder, particularly, after, the, collapse, of, ronan, point, in, 1968, although, tower, blocks, are, controversial, and, numerous, examples, have, been, demolished, many, still, remain, in, large, cities, due, to, lack, of, proper, regulation, some, tower, blocks, present, a, significant, fire, risk, and, even, though, there, have, been, efforts, to, make, them, more, safe, modern, safety, precautions, can, be, prohibitively, expensive, to, retrofit, the, grenfell, tower, fire, in, 2017, was, partly, caused, by, council, ignorance, as, a, local, action, group, complained, to, the, council, about, the, fire, hazards, of, the, tower, several, years, before, the, incident, yet, remedial, work, had, not, been, carried, out, this, fire, further, made, tower, blocks, less, desirable, to, british, residents, there, are, old, high, rise, buildings, built, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, areas, of, london, such, as, tower, hamlets, newham, hackney, and, virtually, any, area, in, london, with, council, housing, some, new, high, rises, are, being, built, in, areas, such, as, central, london, southwark, and, nine, elms, in, east, london, some, old, high, rises, are, being, gentrified, in, addition, to, new, high, rises, being, built, in, areas, such, as, stratford, and, canary, wharf, the, majority, of, residential, high, rise, buildings, in, the, republic, of, ireland, were, concentrated, in, the, suburb, of, ballymun, dublin, the, ballymun, flats, were, built, between, 1966, and, 1969, seven, 15, story, towers, nineteen, 8, story, blocks, and, ten, 4, story, blocks, these, were, the, seven, towers, referred, to, in, the, u2, song, running, to, stand, still, they, have, since, been, demolished, inner, dublin, flat, complexes, typically, of, 4, 5, storeys, include, sheriff, street, demolished, fatima, mansions, demolished, and, redeveloped, st, joseph, s, gardens, demolished, replaced, by, killarney, court, flat, complex, st, teresa, s, gardens, dolphin, house, liberty, house, st, michael, s, estate, 8, storeys, and, o, devaney, gardens, and, a, lot, more, mainly, throughout, the, north, and, south, inner, city, of, dublin, suburban, flat, complexes, were, built, exclusively, on, the, northside, of, the, city, in, ballymun, coolock, and, kilbarrack, these, flats, were, badly, affected, by, a, heroin, epidemic, that, hit, working, class, areas, of, dublin, in, the, 1980s, and, early, 90s, residential, tower, blocks, were, previously, uncommon, outside, of, dublin, but, during, the, era, of, the, celtic, tiger, the, largest, cities, such, as, dublin, cork, limerick, and, galway, witnessed, new, large, apartment, building, although, their, heights, have, generally, been, restricted, some, large, towns, such, as, navan, drogheda, dundalk, and, mullingar, have, also, witnessed, the, construction, of, many, modern, apartment, blocks, tower, blocks, in, northern, ireland, were, never, built, to, the, frequency, as, in, cities, on, the, island, of, great, britain, but, taller, high, rises, are, generally, more, common, than, in, the, republic, of, ireland, most, tower, blocks, and, flat, complexes, are, found, in, belfast, although, many, of, these, have, been, demolished, since, the, 1990s, and, replaced, with, traditional, public, housing, units, the, mid, rise, divis, flats, complex, in, west, belfast, was, built, between, 1968, and, 1972, it, was, demolished, in, the, early, 1990s, after, the, residents, demanded, new, houses, due, to, mounting, problems, with, their, flats, divis, tower, built, separately, in, 1966, still, stands, however, and, in, 2007, work, began, to, convert, the, former, british, army, base, at, the, top, two, floors, into, new, dwellings, divis, tower, was, for, several, decades, ireland, s, tallest, residential, building, having, since, being, surpassed, by, the, privately, owned, obel, tower, in, the, city, centre, in, the, north, of, the, city, the,
