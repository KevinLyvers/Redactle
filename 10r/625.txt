the, space, shuttle, is, a, retired, partially, reusable, low, earth, orbital, spacecraft, system, operated, from, 1981, to, 2011, by, the, u, s, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, nasa, as, part, of, the, space, shuttle, program, its, official, program, name, was, space, transportation, system, sts, taken, from, the, 1969, plan, led, by, u, s, vice, president, spiro, agnew, for, a, system, of, reusable, spacecraft, where, it, was, the, only, item, funded, for, development, 163, 166, the, first, sts, 1, of, four, orbital, test, flights, occurred, in, 1981, leading, to, operational, flights, sts, 5, beginning, in, 1982, five, complete, space, shuttle, orbiter, vehicles, were, built, and, flown, on, a, total, of, 135, missions, from, 1981, to, 2011, they, launched, from, the, kennedy, space, center, ksc, in, florida, operational, missions, launched, numerous, satellites, interplanetary, probes, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, hst, conducted, science, experiments, in, orbit, participated, in, the, shuttle, mir, program, with, russia, and, participated, in, the, construction, and, servicing, of, the, international, space, station, iss, the, space, shuttle, fleet, s, total, mission, time, was, 1, 323, days, space, shuttle, components, include, the, orbiter, vehicle, ov, with, three, clustered, rocketdyne, rs, 25, main, engines, a, pair, of, recoverable, solid, rocket, boosters, srbs, and, the, expendable, external, tank, et, containing, liquid, hydrogen, and, liquid, oxygen, the, space, shuttle, was, launched, vertically, like, a, conventional, rocket, with, the, two, srbs, operating, in, parallel, with, the, orbiter, s, three, main, engines, which, were, fueled, from, the, et, the, srbs, were, jettisoned, before, the, vehicle, reached, orbit, while, the, main, engines, continued, to, operate, and, the, et, was, jettisoned, after, main, engine, cutoff, and, just, before, orbit, insertion, which, used, the, orbiter, s, two, orbital, maneuvering, system, oms, engines, at, the, conclusion, of, the, mission, the, orbiter, fired, its, oms, to, deorbit, and, reenter, the, atmosphere, the, orbiter, was, protected, during, reentry, by, its, thermal, protection, system, tiles, and, it, glided, as, a, spaceplane, to, a, runway, landing, usually, to, the, shuttle, landing, facility, at, ksc, florida, or, to, rogers, dry, lake, in, edwards, air, force, base, california, if, the, landing, occurred, at, edwards, the, orbiter, was, flown, back, to, the, ksc, atop, the, shuttle, carrier, aircraft, sca, a, specially, modified, boeing, 747, designed, to, carry, the, shuttle, above, it, the, first, orbiter, enterprise, was, built, in, 1976, and, used, in, approach, and, landing, tests, alt, but, had, no, orbital, capability, four, fully, operational, orbiters, were, initially, built, columbia, challenger, discovery, and, atlantis, of, these, two, were, lost, in, mission, accidents, challenger, in, 1986, and, columbia, in, 2003, with, a, total, of, 14, astronauts, killed, a, fifth, operational, and, sixth, in, total, orbiter, endeavour, was, built, in, 1991, to, replace, challenger, the, three, surviving, operational, vehicles, were, retired, from, service, following, atlantis, s, final, flight, on, july, 21, 2011, the, u, s, relied, on, the, russian, soyuz, spacecraft, to, transport, astronauts, to, the, iss, from, the, last, shuttle, flight, until, the, launch, of, the, crew, dragon, demo, 2, mission, in, may, 2020, in, the, late, 1930s, the, german, government, launched, the, amerikabomber, project, and, eugen, sanger, s, idea, together, with, mathematician, irene, bredt, was, a, winged, rocket, called, the, silbervogel, german, for, silver, bird, during, the, 1950s, the, united, states, air, force, proposed, using, a, reusable, piloted, glider, to, perform, military, operations, such, as, reconnaissance, satellite, attack, and, air, to, ground, weapons, employment, in, the, late, 1950s, the, air, force, began, developing, the, partially, reusable, x, 20, dyna, soar, the, air, force, collaborated, with, nasa, on, the, dyna, soar, and, began, training, six, pilots, in, june, 1961, the, rising, costs, of, development, and, the, prioritization, of, project, gemini, led, to, the, cancellation, of, the, dyna, soar, program, in, december, 1963, in, addition, to, the, dyna, soar, the, air, force, had, conducted, a, study, in, 1957, to, test, the, feasibility, of, reusable, boosters, this, became, the, basis, for, the, aerospaceplane, a, fully, reusable, spacecraft, that, was, never, developed, beyond, the, initial, design, phase, in, 1962, 1963, 162, 163, beginning, in, the, early, 1950s, nasa, and, the, air, force, collaborated, on, developing, lifting, bodies, to, test, aircraft, that, primarily, generated, lift, from, their, fuselages, instead, of, wings, and, tested, the, nasa, m2, f1, northrop, m2, f2, northrop, m2, f3, northrop, hl, 10, martin, marietta, x, 24a, and, the, martin, marietta, x, 24b, the, program, tested, aerodynamic, characteristics, that, would, later, be, incorporated, in, design, of, the, space, shuttle, including, unpowered, landing, from, a, high, altitude, and, speed, 142, 16, 18, on, september, 24, 1966, as, the, apollo, space, program, neared, its, design, completion, nasa, and, the, air, force, released, a, joint, study, concluding, that, a, new, vehicle, was, required, to, satisfy, their, respective, future, demands, and, that, a, partially, reusable, system, would, be, the, most, cost, effective, solution, 164, the, head, of, the, nasa, office, of, manned, space, flight, george, mueller, announced, the, plan, for, a, reusable, shuttle, on, august, 10, 1968, nasa, issued, a, request, for, proposal, rfp, for, designs, of, the, integral, launch, and, reentry, vehicle, ilrv, on, october, 30, 1968, rather, than, award, a, contract, based, upon, initial, proposals, nasa, announced, a, phased, approach, for, the, space, shuttle, contracting, and, development, phase, a, was, a, request, for, studies, completed, by, competing, aerospace, companies, phase, b, was, a, competition, between, two, contractors, for, a, specific, contract, phase, c, involved, designing, the, details, of, the, spacecraft, components, and, phase, d, was, the, production, of, the, spacecraft, 19, 22, in, december, 1968, nasa, created, the, space, shuttle, task, group, to, determine, the, optimal, design, for, a, reusable, spacecraft, and, issued, study, contracts, to, general, dynamics, lockheed, mcdonnell, douglas, and, north, american, rockwell, in, july, 1969, the, space, shuttle, task, group, issued, a, report, that, determined, the, shuttle, would, support, short, duration, crewed, missions, and, space, station, as, well, as, the, capabilities, to, launch, service, and, retrieve, satellites, the, report, also, created, three, classes, of, a, future, reusable, shuttle, class, i, would, have, a, reusable, orbiter, mounted, on, expendable, boosters, class, ii, would, use, multiple, expendable, rocket, engines, and, a, single, propellant, tank, stage, and, a, half, and, class, iii, would, have, both, a, reusable, orbiter, and, a, reusable, booster, in, september, 1969, the, space, task, group, under, the, leadership, of, u, s, vice, president, spiro, agnew, issued, a, report, calling, for, the, development, of, a, space, shuttle, to, bring, people, and, cargo, to, low, earth, orbit, leo, as, well, as, a, space, tug, for, transfers, between, orbits, and, the, moon, and, a, reusable, nuclear, upper, stage, for, deep, space, travel, 163, 166, after, the, release, of, the, space, shuttle, task, group, report, many, aerospace, engineers, favored, the, class, iii, fully, reusable, design, because, of, perceived, savings, in, hardware, costs, max, faget, a, nasa, engineer, who, had, worked, to, design, the, mercury, capsule, patented, a, design, for, a, two, stage, fully, recoverable, system, with, a, straight, winged, orbiter, mounted, on, a, larger, straight, winged, booster, the, air, force, flight, dynamics, laboratory, argued, that, a, straight, wing, design, would, not, be, able, to, withstand, the, high, thermal, and, aerodynamic, stresses, during, reentry, and, would, not, provide, the, required, cross, range, capability, additionally, the, air, force, required, a, larger, payload, capacity, than, faget, s, design, allowed, in, january, 1971, nasa, and, air, force, leadership, decided, that, a, reusable, delta, wing, orbiter, mounted, on, an, expendable, propellant, tank, would, be, the, optimal, design, for, the, space, shuttle, 166, after, they, established, the, need, for, a, reusable, heavy, lift, spacecraft, nasa, and, the, air, force, determined, the, design, requirements, of, their, respective, services, the, air, force, expected, to, use, the, space, shuttle, to, launch, large, satellites, and, required, it, to, be, capable, of, lifting, 29, 000, kg, 65, 000, lb, to, an, eastward, leo, or, 18, 000, kg, 40, 000, lb, into, a, polar, orbit, the, satellite, designs, also, required, that, the, space, shuttle, have, a, 4, 6, by, 18, m, 15, by, 60, ft, payload, bay, nasa, evaluated, the, f, 1, and, j, 2, engines, from, the, saturn, rockets, and, determined, that, they, were, insufficient, for, the, requirements, of, the, space, shuttle, in, july, 1971, it, issued, a, contract, to, rocketdyne, to, begin, development, on, the, rs, 25, engine, 165, 170, nasa, reviewed, 29, potential, designs, for, the, space, shuttle, and, determined, that, a, design, with, two, side, boosters, should, be, used, and, the, boosters, should, be, reusable, to, reduce, costs, 167, nasa, and, the, air, force, elected, to, use, solid, propellant, boosters, because, of, the, lower, costs, and, the, ease, of, refurbishing, them, for, reuse, after, they, landed, in, the, ocean, in, january, 1972, president, richard, nixon, approved, the, shuttle, and, nasa, decided, on, its, final, design, in, march, the, development, of, the, space, shuttle, main, engine, ssme, remained, the, responsibility, of, rocketdyne, and, the, contract, was, issued, in, july, 1971, and, updated, ssme, specifications, were, submitted, to, rocketdyne, in, that, april, that, august, nasa, awarded, the, contract, to, build, the, orbiter, to, north, american, rockwell, in, august, 1973, the, external, tank, contract, to, martin, marietta, and, in, november, the, solid, rocket, booster, contract, to, morton, thiokol, 170, 173, on, june, 4, 1974, rockwell, began, construction, on, the, first, orbiter, ov, 101, dubbed, constitution, later, to, be, renamed, enterprise, enterprise, was, designed, as, a, test, vehicle, and, did, not, include,

were, connected, to, cool, the, crew, and, equipment, and, dissipate, excess, heat, from, reentry, iii, 13, a, flight, surgeon, boarded, the, orbiter, and, performed, medical, checks, of, the, crew, before, they, disembarked, once, the, orbiter, was, secured, it, was, towed, to, the, opf, to, be, inspected, repaired, and, prepared, for, the, next, mission, the, space, shuttle, flew, from, april, 12, 1981, iii, 24, until, july, 21, 2011, iii, 398, throughout, the, program, the, space, shuttle, had, 135, missions, iii, 398, of, which, 133, returned, safely, iii, 80, 304, throughout, its, lifetime, the, space, shuttle, was, used, to, conduct, scientific, research, iii, 188, deploy, commercial, iii, 66, military, iii, 68, and, scientific, payloads, iii, 148, and, was, involved, in, the, construction, and, operation, of, mir, iii, 216, and, the, iss, iii, 264, during, its, tenure, the, space, shuttle, served, as, the, only, u, s, vehicle, to, launch, astronauts, of, which, there, was, no, replacement, until, the, launch, of, crew, dragon, demo, 2, on, may, 30, 2020, the, overall, nasa, budget, of, the, space, shuttle, program, has, been, estimated, to, be, 221, billion, in, 2012, dollars, iii, 488, the, developers, of, the, space, shuttle, advocated, for, reusability, as, a, cost, saving, measure, which, resulted, in, higher, development, costs, for, presumed, lower, costs, per, launch, during, the, design, of, the, space, shuttle, the, phase, b, proposals, were, not, as, cheap, as, the, initial, phase, a, estimates, indicated, space, shuttle, program, manager, robert, thompson, acknowledged, that, reducing, cost, per, pound, was, not, the, primary, objective, of, the, further, design, phases, as, other, technical, requirements, could, not, be, met, with, the, reduced, costs, iii, 489, 490, development, estimates, made, in, 1972, projected, a, per, pound, cost, of, payload, as, low, as, 1, 109, in, 2012, per, pound, but, the, actual, payload, costs, not, to, include, the, costs, for, the, research, and, development, of, the, space, shuttle, were, 37, 207, in, 2012, per, pound, iii, 491, per, launch, costs, varied, throughout, the, program, and, were, dependent, on, the, rate, of, flights, as, well, as, research, development, and, investigation, proceedings, throughout, the, space, shuttle, program, in, 1982, nasa, published, an, estimate, of, 260, million, in, 2012, per, flight, which, was, based, on, the, prediction, of, 24, flights, per, year, for, a, decade, the, per, launch, cost, from, 1995, to, 2002, when, the, orbiters, and, iss, were, not, being, constructed, and, there, was, no, recovery, work, following, a, loss, of, crew, was, 806, million, nasa, published, a, study, in, 1999, that, concluded, that, costs, were, 576, million, in, 2012, if, there, were, seven, launches, per, year, in, 2009, nasa, determined, that, the, cost, of, adding, a, single, launch, per, year, was, 252, million, in, 2012, which, indicated, that, much, of, the, space, shuttle, program, costs, are, for, year, round, personnel, and, operations, that, continued, regardless, of, the, launch, rate, accounting, for, the, entire, space, shuttle, program, budget, the, per, launch, cost, was, 1, 642, billion, in, 2012, iii, 490, on, january, 28, 1986, sts, 51, l, disintegrated, 73, seconds, after, launch, due, to, the, failure, of, the, right, srb, killing, all, seven, astronauts, on, board, challenger, the, disaster, was, caused, by, the, low, temperature, impairment, of, an, o, ring, a, mission, critical, seal, used, between, segments, of, the, srb, casing, failure, of, the, o, ring, allowed, hot, combustion, gases, to, escape, from, between, the, booster, sections, and, burn, through, the, adjacent, et, leading, to, a, sequence, of, catastrophic, events, which, caused, the, orbiter, to, disintegrate, 71, repeated, warnings, from, design, engineers, voicing, concerns, about, the, lack, of, evidence, of, the, o, rings, safety, when, the, temperature, was, below, 53, f, 12, c, had, been, ignored, by, nasa, managers, 148, on, february, 1, 2003, columbia, disintegrated, during, re, entry, killing, all, seven, of, the, sts, 107, crew, because, of, damage, to, the, carbon, carbon, leading, edge, of, the, wing, caused, during, launch, ground, control, engineers, had, made, three, separate, requests, for, high, resolution, images, taken, by, the, department, of, defense, that, would, have, provided, an, understanding, of, the, extent, of, the, damage, while, nasa, s, chief, tps, engineer, requested, that, astronauts, on, board, columbia, be, allowed, to, leave, the, vehicle, to, inspect, the, damage, nasa, managers, intervened, to, stop, the, department, of, defense, s, imaging, of, the, orbiter, and, refused, the, request, for, the, spacewalk, iii, 323, and, thus, the, feasibility, of, scenarios, for, astronaut, repair, or, rescue, by, atlantis, were, not, considered, by, nasa, management, at, the, time, the, partial, reusability, of, the, space, shuttle, was, one, of, the, primary, design, requirements, during, its, initial, development, 164, the, technical, decisions, that, dictated, the, orbiter, s, return, and, re, use, reduced, the, per, launch, payload, capabilities, the, original, intention, was, to, compensate, for, this, lower, payload, by, lowering, the, per, launch, costs, and, a, high, launch, frequency, however, the, actual, costs, of, a, space, shuttle, launch, were, higher, than, initially, predicted, and, the, space, shuttle, did, not, fly, the, intended, 24, missions, per, year, as, initially, predicted, by, nasa, iii, 489, 490, the, space, shuttle, was, originally, intended, as, a, launch, vehicle, to, deploy, satellites, which, it, was, primarily, used, for, on, the, missions, prior, to, the, challenger, disaster, nasa, s, pricing, which, was, below, cost, was, lower, than, expendable, launch, vehicles, the, intention, was, that, the, high, volume, of, space, shuttle, missions, would, compensate, for, early, financial, losses, the, improvement, of, expendable, launch, vehicles, and, the, transition, away, from, commercial, payloads, on, the, space, shuttle, resulted, in, expendable, launch, vehicles, becoming, the, primary, deployment, option, for, satellites, iii, 109, 112, a, key, customer, for, the, space, shuttle, was, the, national, reconnaissance, office, nro, responsible, for, spy, satellites, the, existence, of, nro, s, connection, was, classified, through, 1993, and, secret, considerations, of, nro, payload, requirements, led, to, lack, of, transparency, in, the, program, the, proposed, shuttle, centaur, program, cancelled, in, the, wake, of, the, challenger, disaster, would, have, pushed, the, spacecraft, beyond, its, operational, capacity, the, fatal, challenger, and, columbia, disasters, demonstrated, the, safety, risks, of, the, space, shuttle, that, could, result, in, the, loss, of, the, crew, the, spaceplane, design, of, the, orbiter, limited, the, abort, options, as, the, abort, scenarios, required, the, controlled, flight, of, the, orbiter, to, a, runway, or, to, allow, the, crew, to, egress, individually, rather, than, the, abort, escape, options, on, the, apollo, and, soyuz, space, capsules, early, safety, analyses, advertised, by, nasa, engineers, and, management, predicted, the, chance, of, a, catastrophic, failure, resulting, in, the, death, of, the, crew, as, ranging, from, 1, in, 100, launches, to, as, rare, as, 1, in, 100, 000, following, the, loss, of, two, space, shuttle, missions, the, risks, for, the, initial, missions, were, reevaluated, and, the, chance, of, a, catastrophic, loss, of, the, vehicle, and, crew, was, found, to, be, as, high, as, 1, in, 9, nasa, management, was, criticized, afterwards, for, accepting, increased, risk, to, the, crew, in, exchange, for, higher, mission, rates, both, the, challenger, and, columbia, reports, explained, that, nasa, culture, had, failed, to, keep, the, crew, safe, by, not, objectively, evaluating, the, potential, risks, of, the, missions, 195, 203, the, space, shuttle, retirement, was, announced, in, january, 2004, iii, 347, president, george, w, bush, announced, his, vision, for, space, exploration, which, called, for, the, retirement, of, the, space, shuttle, once, it, completed, construction, of, the, iss, to, ensure, the, iss, was, properly, assembled, the, contributing, partners, determined, the, need, for, 16, remaining, assembly, missions, in, march, 2006, iii, 349, one, additional, hubble, space, telescope, servicing, mission, was, approved, in, october, 2006, iii, 352, originally, sts, 134, was, to, be, the, final, space, shuttle, mission, however, the, columbia, disaster, resulted, in, additional, orbiters, being, prepared, for, launch, on, need, in, the, event, of, a, rescue, mission, as, atlantis, was, prepared, for, the, final, launch, on, need, mission, the, decision, was, made, in, september, 2010, that, it, would, fly, as, sts, 135, with, a, four, person, crew, that, could, remain, at, the, iss, in, the, event, of, an, emergency, iii, 355, sts, 135,
