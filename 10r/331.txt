the, brooklyn, bridge, is, a, hybrid, cable, stayed, suspension, bridge, in, new, york, city, spanning, the, east, river, between, the, boroughs, of, manhattan, and, brooklyn, opened, on, may, 24, 1883, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, the, first, fixed, crossing, of, the, east, river, it, was, also, the, longest, suspension, bridge, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, its, opening, with, a, main, span, of, 1, 595, 5, feet, 486, 3, m, and, a, deck, 127, ft, 38, 7, m, above, mean, high, water, the, span, was, originally, called, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, or, the, east, river, bridge, but, was, officially, renamed, the, brooklyn, bridge, in, 1915, proposals, for, a, bridge, connecting, manhattan, and, brooklyn, were, first, made, in, the, early, 19th, century, which, eventually, led, to, the, construction, of, the, current, span, designed, by, john, a, roebling, the, project, s, chief, engineer, his, son, washington, roebling, contributed, further, design, work, assisted, by, the, latter, s, wife, emily, warren, roebling, construction, started, in, 1870, and, was, overseen, by, the, new, york, bridge, company, which, in, turn, was, controlled, by, the, tammany, hall, political, machine, numerous, controversies, and, the, novelty, of, the, design, prolonged, the, project, over, thirteen, years, after, opening, the, brooklyn, bridge, underwent, several, reconfigurations, having, carried, horse, drawn, vehicles, and, elevated, railway, lines, until, 1950, to, alleviate, increasing, traffic, flows, additional, bridges, and, tunnels, were, built, across, the, east, river, following, gradual, deterioration, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, renovated, several, times, including, in, the, 1950s, 1980s, and, 2010s, the, brooklyn, bridge, is, the, southernmost, of, the, four, toll, free, vehicular, bridges, connecting, manhattan, island, and, long, island, with, the, manhattan, bridge, the, williamsburg, bridge, and, the, queensboro, bridge, to, the, north, only, passenger, vehicles, and, pedestrian, and, bicycle, traffic, are, permitted, a, major, tourist, attraction, since, its, opening, the, brooklyn, bridge, has, become, an, icon, of, new, york, city, over, the, years, the, bridge, has, been, used, as, the, location, of, various, stunts, and, performances, as, well, as, several, crimes, and, attacks, the, brooklyn, bridge, is, designated, a, national, historic, landmark, a, new, york, city, landmark, and, a, national, historic, civil, engineering, landmark, the, brooklyn, bridge, an, early, example, of, a, steel, wire, suspension, bridge, uses, a, hybrid, cable, stayed, suspension, bridge, design, with, both, vertical, and, diagonal, suspender, cables, its, stone, towers, are, neo, gothic, with, characteristic, pointed, arches, the, new, york, city, department, of, transportation, nycdot, which, maintains, the, bridge, says, that, its, original, paint, scheme, was, brooklyn, bridge, tan, and, silver, but, other, accounts, state, that, it, was, originally, entirely, rawlins, red, to, provide, sufficient, clearance, for, shipping, in, the, east, river, the, brooklyn, bridge, incorporates, long, approach, viaducts, on, either, end, to, raise, it, from, low, ground, on, both, shores, including, approaches, the, brooklyn, bridge, is, a, total, of, 6, 016, feet, 1, 834, m, long, when, measured, between, the, curbs, at, park, row, in, manhattan, and, sands, street, in, brooklyn, a, separate, measurement, of, 5, 989, feet, 1, 825, m, is, sometimes, given, this, is, the, distance, from, the, curb, at, centre, street, in, manhattan, the, main, span, between, the, two, suspension, towers, is, 1, 595, 5, feet, 486, 3, m, long, and, 85, feet, 26, m, wide, the, bridge, elongates, and, contracts, between, the, extremes, of, temperature, from, 14, to, 16, inches, navigational, clearance, is, 127, ft, 38, 7, m, above, mean, high, water, mhw, a, 1909, engineering, magazine, article, said, that, at, the, center, of, the, span, the, height, above, mhw, could, fluctuate, by, more, than, 9, feet, 2, 7, m, due, to, temperature, and, traffic, loads, while, more, rigid, spans, had, a, lower, maximum, deflection, the, side, spans, between, each, suspension, tower, and, each, side, s, suspension, anchorages, are, 930, feet, 280, m, long, at, the, time, of, construction, engineers, had, not, yet, discovered, the, aerodynamics, of, bridge, construction, and, bridge, designs, were, not, tested, in, wind, tunnels, john, roebling, designed, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, truss, system, to, be, six, to, eight, times, as, strong, as, he, thought, it, needed, to, be, as, such, the, open, truss, structure, supporting, the, deck, is, by, its, nature, subject, to, fewer, aerodynamic, problems, however, due, to, a, supplier, s, fraudulent, substitution, of, inferior, quality, wire, in, the, initial, construction, the, bridge, was, reappraised, at, the, time, as, being, only, four, times, as, strong, as, necessary, the, main, span, and, side, spans, are, supported, by, a, structure, containing, trusses, that, run, parallel, to, the, roadway, each, of, which, is, 33, feet, 10, m, deep, originally, there, were, six, trusses, but, two, were, removed, during, a, late, 1940s, renovation, the, trusses, allow, the, brooklyn, bridge, to, hold, a, total, load, of, 18, 700, short, tons, 16, 700, long, tons, a, design, consideration, from, when, it, originally, carried, heavier, elevated, trains, these, trusses, are, held, up, by, suspender, ropes, which, hang, downward, from, each, of, the, four, main, cables, crossbeams, run, between, the, trusses, at, the, top, and, diagonal, and, vertical, stiffening, beams, run, on, the, outside, and, inside, of, each, roadway, an, elevated, pedestrian, only, promenade, runs, in, between, the, two, roadways, and, 18, feet, 5, 5, m, above, them, it, typically, runs, 4, feet, 1, 2, m, below, the, level, of, the, crossbeams, except, at, the, areas, surrounding, each, tower, here, the, promenade, rises, to, just, above, the, level, of, the, crossbeams, connecting, to, a, balcony, that, slightly, overhangs, the, two, roadways, the, path, is, generally, 10, to, 17, feet, 3, 0, to, 5, 2, m, wide, the, iron, railings, were, produced, by, janes, kirtland, a, bronx, iron, foundry, that, also, made, the, united, states, capitol, dome, and, the, bow, bridge, in, central, park, each, of, the, side, spans, is, reached, by, an, approach, ramp, the, 971, foot, 296, m, approach, ramp, from, the, brooklyn, side, is, shorter, than, the, 1, 567, foot, 478, m, approach, ramp, from, the, manhattan, side, the, approaches, are, supported, by, renaissance, style, arches, made, of, masonry, the, arch, openings, themselves, were, filled, with, brick, walls, with, small, windows, within, the, approach, ramp, contains, nine, arch, or, iron, girder, bridges, across, side, streets, in, manhattan, and, brooklyn, underneath, the, manhattan, approach, a, series, of, brick, slopes, or, banks, was, developed, into, a, skate, park, the, brooklyn, banks, in, the, late, 1980s, the, park, uses, the, approach, s, support, pillars, as, obstacles, in, the, mid, 2010s, the, brooklyn, banks, were, closed, to, the, public, because, the, area, was, being, used, as, a, storage, site, during, the, bridge, s, renovation, the, skateboarding, community, has, attempted, to, save, the, banks, on, multiple, occasions, after, the, city, destroyed, the, smaller, banks, in, the, 2000s, the, city, government, agreed, to, keep, the, larger, banks, for, skateboarding, when, the, nycdot, removed, the, bricks, from, the, banks, in, 2020, skateboarders, started, an, online, petition, in, the, 2020s, local, resident, rosa, chang, advocated, for, the, 9, acre, 3, 6, ha, space, under, the, manhattan, approach, to, be, converted, into, a, recreational, area, known, as, gotham, park, the, brooklyn, bridge, contains, four, main, cables, which, descend, from, the, tops, of, the, suspension, towers, and, help, support, the, deck, two, are, located, to, the, outside, of, the, bridge, s, roadways, while, two, are, in, the, median, of, the, roadways, each, main, cable, measures, 15, 75, inches, 40, 0, cm, in, diameter, and, contains, 5, 282, parallel, galvanized, steel, wires, wrapped, closely, together, in, a, cylindrical, shape, these, wires, are, bundled, in, 19, individual, strands, with, 278, wires, to, a, strand, this, was, the, first, use, of, bundling, in, a, suspension, bridge, and, took, several, months, for, workers, to, tie, together, since, the, 2000s, the, main, cables, have, also, supported, a, series, of, 24, watt, led, lighting, fixtures, referred, to, as, necklace, lights, due, to, their, shape, in, addition, either, 1, 088, 1, 096, or, 1, 520, galvanized, steel, wire, suspender, cables, hang, downward, from, the, main, cables, another, 400, cable, stays, extend, diagonally, from, the, towers, the, vertical, suspender, cables, and, diagonal, cable, stays, hold, up, the, truss, structure, around, the, bridge, deck, the, bridge, s, suspenders, originally, used, wire, rope, which, was, replaced, in, the, 1980s, with, galvanized, steel, made, by, bethlehem, steel, the, vertical, suspender, cables, measure, 8, to, 130, feet, 2, 4, to, 39, 6, m, long, and, the, diagonal, stays, measure, 138, to, 449, feet, 42, to, 137, m, long, each, side, of, the, bridge, contains, an, anchorage, for, the, main, cables, the, anchorages, are, trapezoidal, limestone, structures, located, slightly, inland, of, the, shore, measuring, 129, by, 119, feet, 39, by, 36, m, at, the, base, and, 117, by, 104, feet, 36, by, 32, m, at, the, top, each, anchorage, weighs, 60, 000, short, tons, 54, 000, long, tons, 54, 000, t, the, manhattan, anchorage, rests, on, a, foundation, of, bedrock, while, the, brooklyn, anchorage, rests, on, clay, the, anchorages, both, have, four, anchor, plates, one, for, each, of, the, main, cables, which, are, located, near, ground, level, and, parallel, to, the, ground, the, anchor, plates, measure, 16, by, 17, 5, feet, 4, 9, by, 5, 3, m, with, a, thickness, of, 2, 5, feet, 0, 76, m, and, weigh, 46, 000, pounds, 21, 000, kg, each, each, anchor, plate, is, connected, to, the, respective, main, cable, by, two, sets, of, nine, eyebars, each, of, which, is, about, 12, 5, feet, 3, 8, m, long, and, up, to, 9, by, 3, inches, 229, by, 76, mm, thick, the, chains, of, eyebars, curve, downward, from, the, cables, toward, the, anchor, plates, and, the, eyebars, vary, in, size, depending, on, their, position, the, anchorages, also, contain, numerous, passageways, and, compartments, starting, in, 1876, in, order, to, fund, the, bridge, s, maintenance, the, new, york, city, government, made, the, large, vaults, under, the, bridge, s, manhattan, anchorage, available, for, rent, and, they, were, in, constant, use, during, the, early, 20th, century, the, vaults, were, used, to, store, wine, as, they, were, kept, at, a, consistent, 60, f, 16, c, temperature, due, to, a, lack, of, air, circulation, the, manhattan, vault, was, called, the, blue, grotto, because, of, a, shrine, to, the, virgin, mary, next, to, an, opening, at, the, entrance, the, vaults, were, closed, for, public, use, in, the, late, 1910s, and, 1920s, during, world, war, i, and, prohibition, but, were, reopened, thereafter, when, new, york, magazine, visited, one, of, the, cellars, in, 1978, it, discovered, a, fading, inscription, on, a, wall, reading, who, loveth, not, wine, women, and, song, he, remaineth, a, fool, his, whole, life, long, leaks, found, within, the, vault, s, spaces, necessitated, repairs, during, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, by, the, late, 1990s, the, chambers, were, being, used, to, store, maintenance, equipment, the, bridge, s, two, suspension, towers, are, 278, feet, 85, m, tall, with, a, footprint, of, 140, by, 59, feet, 43, by, 18, m, at, the, high, water, line, they, are, built, of, limestone, granite, and, rosendale, cement, the, limestone, was, quarried, at, the, clark, quarry, in, essex, county, new, york, the, granite, blocks, were, quarried, and, shaped, on, vinalhaven, island, maine, under, a, contract, with, the, bodwell, granite, company, and, delivered, from, maine, to, new, york, by, schooner, the, manhattan, tower, contains, 46, 945, cubic, yards, 35, 892, m, 3, of, masonry, while, the, brooklyn, tower, has, 38, 214, cubic, yards, 29, 217, m, 3, of, masonry, there, are, 56, led, lamps, mounted, onto, the, towers, each, tower, contains, a, pair, of, gothic, revival, pointed, arches, through, which, the, roadways, run, the, arch, openings, are, 117, feet, 36, m, tall, and, 33, 75, feet, 10, 29, m, wide, the, tops, of, the, towers, are, located, 159, feet, 48, m, above, the, floor, of, each, arch, opening, while, the, floors, of, the, openings, are, 119, 25, feet, 36, 35, m, above, mean, water, level, giving, the, towers, a, total, height, of, 278, 25, feet, 84, 81, m, above, mean, high, water, the, towers, rest, on, underwater, caissons, made, of, southern, yellow, pine, and, filled, with, cement, inside, both, caissons, were, spaces, for, construction, workers, the, manhattan, side, s, caisson, is, slightly, larger, measuring, 172, by, 102, feet, 52, by, 31, m, and, located, 78, 5, feet, 23, 9, m, below, high, water, while, the, brooklyn, side, s, caisson, measures, 168, by, 102, feet, 51, by, 31, m, and, is, located, 44, 5, feet, 13, 6, m, below, high, water, the, caissons, were, designed, to, hold, at, least, the, weight, of, the, towers, which, would, exert, a, pressure, of, 5, short, tons, per, square, foot, 49, t, m, 2, when, fully, built, but, the, caissons, were, over, engineered, for, safety, during, an, accident, on, the, brooklyn, side, when, air, pressure, was, lost, and, the, partially, built, towers, dropped, full, force, down, the, caisson, sustained, an, estimated, pressure, of, 23, short, tons, per, square, foot, 220, t, m, 2, with, only, minor, damage, most, of, the, timber, used, in, the, bridge, s, construction, including, in, the, caissons, came, from, mills, at, gascoigne, bluff, on, st, simons, island, georgia, the, brooklyn, side, s, caisson, which, was, built, first, originally, had, a, height, of, 9, 5, feet, 2, 9, m, and, a, ceiling, composed, of, five, layers, of, timber, each, layer, 1, foot, 0, 30, m, tall, ten, more, layers, of, timber, were, later, added, atop, the, ceiling, and, the, entire, caisson, was, wrapped, in, tin, and, wood, for, further, protection, against, flooding, the, thickness, of, the, caisson, s, sides, was, 8, feet, 2, 4, m, at, both, the, bottom, and, the, top, the, caisson, had, six, chambers, two, each, for, dredging, supply, shafts, and, airlocks, the, caisson, on, the, manhattan, side, was, slightly, different, because, it, had, to, be, installed, at, a, greater, depth, to, protect, against, the, increased, air, pressure, at, that, depth, the, manhattan, caisson, had, 22, layers, of, timber, on, its, roof, seven, more, than, its, brooklyn, counterpart, had, the, manhattan, caisson, also, had, fifty, 4, inch, diameter, 10, cm, pipes, for, sand, removal, a, fireproof, iron, boilerplate, interior, and, different, airlocks, and, communication, systems, proposals, for, a, bridge, between, the, then, separate, cities, of, brooklyn, and, new, york, had, been, suggested, as, early, as, 1800, at, the, time, the, only, travel, between, the, two, cities, was, by, a, number, of, ferry, lines, engineers, presented, various, designs, such, as, chain, or, link, bridges, though, these, were, never, built, because, of, the, difficulties, of, constructing, a, high, enough, fixed, span, bridge, across, the, extremely, busy, east, river, there, were, also, proposals, for, tunnels, under, the, east, river, but, these, were, considered, prohibitively, expensive, german, immigrant, engineer, john, augustus, roebling, proposed, building, a, suspension, bridge, over, the, east, river, in, 1857, he, had, previously, designed, and, constructed, shorter, suspension, bridges, such, as, roebling, s, delaware, aqueduct, in, lackawaxen, pennsylvania, and, the, niagara, suspension, bridge, in, 1867, roebling, erected, what, became, the, john, a, roebling, suspension, bridge, over, the, ohio, river, between, cincinnati, ohio, and, covington, kentucky, in, february, 1867, the, new, york, state, senate, passed, a, bill, that, allowed, the, construction, of, a, suspension, bridge, from, brooklyn, to, manhattan, two, months, later, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, company, was, incorporated, with, a, board, of, directors, later, converted, to, a, board, of, trustees, there, were, twenty, trustees, in, total, eight, each, appointed, by, the, mayors, of, new, york, and, brooklyn, as, well, as, the, mayors, of, each, city, and, the, auditor, and, comptroller, of, brooklyn, the, company, was, tasked, with, constructing, what, was, then, known, as, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, alternatively, the, span, was, just, referred, to, as, the, brooklyn, bridge, a, name, originating, in, a, january, 25, 1867, letter, to, the, editor, sent, to, the, brooklyn, daily, eagle, the, act, of, incorporation, which, became, law, on, april, 16, 1867, authorized, the, cities, of, new, york, now, manhattan, and, brooklyn, to, subscribe, to, 5, million, in, capital, stock, which, would, fund, the, bridge, s, construction, roebling, was, subsequently, named, the, chief, engineer, of, the, work, and, by, september, 1867, had, presented, a, master, plan, according, to, the, plan, the, bridge, would, be, longer, and, taller, than, any, suspension, bridge, previously, built, it, would, incorporate, roadways, and, elevated, rail, tracks, whose, tolls, and, fares, would, provide, the, means, to, pay, for, the, bridge, s, construction, it, would, also, include, a, raised, promenade, that, served, as, a, leisurely, pathway, the, proposal, received, much, acclaim, in, both, cities, and, residents, predicted, that, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, s, opening, would, have, as, much, of, an, impact, as, the, suez, canal, the, first, transatlantic, telegraph, cable, or, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, by, early, 1869, however, some, individuals, started, to, criticize, the, project, saying, either, that, the, bridge, was, too, expensive, or, that, the, construction, process, was, too, difficult, to, allay, concerns, about, the, design, of, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, roebling, set, up, a, bridge, party, in, march, 1869, where, he, invited, engineers, and, members, of, u, s, congress, to, see, his, other, spans, following, the, bridge, party, in, april, roebling, and, several, engineers, conducted, final, surveys, during, the, process, it, was, determined, that, the, main, span, would, have, to, be, raised, from, 130, to, 135, feet, 40, to, 41, m, above, mhw, requiring, several, changes, to, the, overall, design, in, june, 1869, while, conducting, these, surveys, roebling, sustained, a, crush, injury, to, his, foot, when, a, ferry, pinned, it, against, a, piling, after, amputation, of, his, crushed, toes, he, developed, a, tetanus, infection, that, left, him, incapacitated, and, resulted, in, his, death, the, following, month, washington, roebling, john, roebling, s, 32, year, old, son, was, then, hired, to, fill, his, father, s, role, tammany, hall, leader, william, m, tweed, also, became, involved, in, the, bridge, s, construction, because, as, a, major, landowner, in, new, york, city, he, had, an, interest, in, the, project, s, completion, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, company, later, known, simply, as, the, new, york, bridge, company, was, actually, overseen, by, tammany, hall, and, it, approved, roebling, s, plans, and, designated, him, as, chief, engineer, of, the, project, construction, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, began, on, january, 2, 1870, the, first, work, entailed, the, construction, of, two, caissons, upon, which, the, suspension, towers, would, be, built, the, brooklyn, side, s, caisson, was, built, at, the, webb, bell, shipyard, in, greenpoint, brooklyn, and, was, launched, into, the, river, on, march, 19, 1870, compressed, air, was, pumped, into, the, caisson, and, workers, entered, the, space, to, dig, the, sediment, until, it, sank, to, the, bedrock, as, one, sixteen, year, old, from, ireland, frank, harris, described, the, fearful, experience, the, six, of, us, were, working, naked, to, the, waist, in, the, small, iron, chamber, with, the, temperature, of, about, 80, degrees, fahrenheit, in, five, minutes, the, sweat, was, pouring, from, us, and, all, the, while, we, were, standing, in, icy, water, that, was, only, kept, from, rising, by, the, terrific, pressure, no, wonder, the, headaches, were, blinding, once, the, caisson, had, reached, the, desired, depth, it, was, to, be, filled, in, with, vertical, brick, piers, and, concrete, however, due, to, the, unexpectedly, high, concentration, of, large, boulders, atop, the, riverbed, the, brooklyn, caisson, took, several, months, to, sink, to, the, desired, depth, furthermore, in, december, 1870, its, timber, roof, caught, fire, delaying, construction, further, the, great, blowout, as, the, fire, was, called, delayed, construction, for, several, months, since, the, holes, in, the, caisson, had, to, be, repaired, on, march, 6, 1871, the, repairs, were, finished, and, the, caisson, had, reached, its, final, depth, of, 44, 5, feet, 13, 6, m, it, was, filled, with, concrete, five, days, later, overall, about, 264, individuals, were, estimated, to, have, worked, in, the, caisson, every, day, but, because, of, high, worker, turnover, the, final, total, was, thought, to, be, about, 2, 500, men, in, total, in, spite, of, this, only, a, few, workers, were, paralyzed, at, its, final, depth, the, caisson, s, air, pressure, was, 21, pounds, per, square, inch, 140, kpa, the, manhattan, side, s, caisson, was, the, next, structure, to, be, built, to, ensure, that, it, would, not, catch, fire, like, its, counterpart, had, the, manhattan, caisson, was, lined, with, fireproof, plate, iron, it, was, launched, from, webb, bell, s, shipyard, on, may, 11, 1871, and, maneuvered, into, place, that, september, due, to, the, extreme, underwater, air, pressure, inside, the, much, deeper, manhattan, caisson, many, workers, became, sick, with, the, bends, decompression, sickness, during, this, work, despite, the, incorporation, of, airlocks, which, were, believed, to, help, with, decompression, sickness, at, the, time, this, condition, was, unknown, at, the, time, and, was, first, called, caisson, disease, by, the, project, physician, andrew, smith, between, january, 25, and, may, 31, 1872, smith, treated, 110, cases, of, decompression, sickness, while, three, workers, died, from, the, disease, when, iron, probes, underneath, the, manhattan, caisson, found, the, bedrock, to, be, even, deeper, than, expected, washington, roebling, halted, construction, due, to, the, increased, risk, of, decompression, sickness, after, the, manhattan, caisson, reached, a, depth, of, 78, 5, feet, 23, 9, m, with, an, air, pressure, of, 35, pounds, per, square, inch, 240, kpa, washington, deemed, the, sandy, subsoil, overlying, the, bedrock, 30, feet, 9, 1, m, beneath, to, be, sufficiently, firm, and, subsequently, infilled, the, caisson, with, concrete, in, july, 1872, washington, roebling, himself, suffered, a, paralyzing, injury, as, a, result, of, caisson, disease, shortly, after, ground, was, broken, for, the, brooklyn, tower, foundation, his, debilitating, condition, left, him, unable, to, supervise, the, construction, in, person, so, he, designed, the, caissons, and, other, equipment, from, his, apartment, directing, the, completion, of, the, bridge, through, a, telescope, from, his, bedroom, his, wife, emily, warren, roebling, not, only, provided, written, communications, between, her, husband, and, the, engineers, on, site, but, also, understood, mathematics, calculations, of, catenary, curves, strengths, of, materials, bridge, specifications, and, the, intricacies, of, cable, construction, she, spent, the, next, 11, years, helping, supervise, the, bridge, s, construction, taking, over, much, of, the, chief, engineer, s, duties, including, day, to, day, supervision, and, project, management, after, the, caissons, were, completed, piers, were, constructed, on, top, of, each, of, them, upon, which, masonry, towers, would, be, built, the, towers, construction, was, a, complex, process, that, took, four, years, since, the, masonry, blocks, were, heavy, the, builders, transported, them, to, the, base, of, the, towers, using, a, pulley, system, with, a, continuous, 1, 5, inch, 3, 8, cm, diameter, steel, wire, rope, operated, by, steam, engines, at, ground, level, the, blocks, were, then, carried, up, on, a, timber, track, alongside, each, tower, and, maneuvered, into, the, proper, position, using, a, derrick, atop, the, towers, the, blocks, sometimes, vibrated, the, ropes, because, of, their, weight, but, only, once, did, a, block, fall, construction, on, the, suspension, towers, started, in, mid, 1872, and, by, the, time, work, was, halted, for, the, winter, in, late, 1872, parts, of, each, tower, had, already, been, built, by, mid, 1873, there, was, substantial, progress, on, the, towers, construction, the, brooklyn, side, s, tower, had, reached, a, height, of, 164, feet, 50, m, above, mean, high, water, mhw, while, the, tower, on, the, manhattan, side, had, reached, 88, feet, 27, m, above, mhw, the, arches, of, the, brooklyn, tower, were, completed, by, august, 1874, the, tower, was, substantially, finished, by, december, 1874, with, the, erection, of, saddle, plates, for, the, main, cables, at, the, top, of, the, tower, however, the, ornamentation, on, the, brooklyn, tower, could, not, be, completed, until, the, manhattan, tower, was, finished, the, last, stone, on, the, brooklyn, tower, was, raised, in, june, 1875, and, the, manhattan, tower, was, completed, in, july, 1876, the, saddle, plates, atop, both, towers, were, also, raised, in, july, 1876, the, work, was, dangerous, by, 1876, three, workers, had, died, having, fallen, from, the, towers, while, nine, other, workers, were, killed, in, other, accidents, in, 1875, while, the, towers, were, being, constructed, the, project, had, depleted, its, original, 5, million, budget, two, bridge, commissioners, one, each, from, brooklyn, and, manhattan, petitioned, new, york, state, lawmakers, to, allot, another, 8, million, for, construction, ultimately, the, legislators, passed, a, law, authorizing, the, allotment, with, the, condition, that, the, cities, would, buy, the, stock, of, brooklyn, bridge, s, private, stockholders, work, proceeded, concurrently, on, the, anchorages, on, each, side, the, brooklyn, anchorage, broke, ground, in, january, 1873, and, was, subsequently, substantially, completed, in, august, 1875, the, manhattan, anchorage, was, built, in, less, time, having, started, in, may, 1875, it, was, mostly, completed, in, july, 1876, the, anchorages, could, not, be, fully, completed, until, the, main, cables, were, spun, at, which, point, another, 6, feet, 1, 8, m, would, be, added, to, the, height, of, each, 80, foot, 24, m, anchorage, the, first, temporary, wire, was, stretched, between, the, towers, on, august, 15, 1876, using, chrome, steel, provided, by, the, chrome, steel, company, of, brooklyn, the, wire, was, then, stretched, back, across, the, river, and, the, two, ends, were, spliced, to, form, a, traveler, a, lengthy, loop, of, wire, connecting, the, towers, which, was, driven, by, a, 30, horsepower, 22, kw, steam, hoisting, engine, at, ground, level, the, wire, was, one, of, two, that, were, used, to, create, a, temporary, footbridge, for, workers, while, cable, spinning, was, ongoing, the, next, step, was, to, send, an, engineer, across, the, completed, traveler, wire, in, a, boatswain, s, chair, slung, from, the, wire, to, ensure, it, was, safe, enough, the, bridge, s, master, mechanic, e, f, farrington, was, selected, for, this, task, and, an, estimated, crowd, of, 10, 000, people, on, both, shores, watched, him, cross, a, second, traveler, wire, was, then, stretched, across, the, span, a, task, that, was, completed, by, august, 30, the, temporary, footbridge, located, some, 60, feet, 18, m, above, the, elevation, of, the, future, deck, was, completed, in, february, 1877, by, december, 1876, a, steel, contract, for, the, permanent, cables, still, had, not, been, awarded, there, was, disagreement, over, whether, the, bridge, s, cables, should, use, the, as, yet, untested, bessemer, steel, or, the, well, proven, crucible, steel, until, a, permanent, contract, was, awarded, the, builders, ordered, 30, short, tons, 27, long, tons, of, wire, in, the, interim, 10, tons, each, from, three, companies, including, washington, roebling, s, own, steel, mill, in, brooklyn, in, the, end, it, was, decided, to, use, number, 8, birmingham, gauge, approximately, 4, mm, or, 0, 165, inches, in, diameter, crucible, steel, and, a, request, for, bids, was, distributed, to, which, eight, companies, responded, in, january, 1877, a, contract, for, crucible, steel, was, awarded, to, j, lloyd, haigh, who, was, associated, with, bridge, trustee, abram, hewitt, whom, roebling, distrusted, the, spinning, of, the, wires, required, the, manufacture, of, large, coils, of, it, which, were, galvanized, but, not, oiled, when, they, left, the, factory, the, coils, were, delivered, to, a, yard, near, the, brooklyn, anchorage, there, they, were, dipped, in, linseed, oil, hoisted, to, the, top, of, the, anchorage, dried, out, and, spliced, into, a, single, wire, and, finally, coated, with, red, zinc, for, further, galvanizing, there, were, thirty, two, drums, at, the, anchorage, yard, eight, for, each, of, the, four, main, cables, each, drum, had, a, capacity, of, 60, 000, feet, 18, 000, m, of, wire, the, first, experimental, wire, for, the, main, cables, was, stretched, between, the, towers, on, may, 29, 1877, and, spinning, began, two, weeks, later, all, four, main, cables, were, being, strung, by, that, july, during, that, time, the, temporary, footbridge, was, unofficially, opened, to, members, of, the, public, who, could, receive, a, visitor, s, pass, by, august, 1877, several, thousand, visitors, from, around, the, world, had, used, the, footbridge, the, visitor, passes, ceased, that, september, after, a, visitor, had, an, epileptic, seizure, and, nearly, fell, off, as, the, wires, were, being, spun, work, also, commenced, on, the, demolition, of, buildings, on, either, side, of, the, river, for, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, approaches, this, work, was, mostly, complete, by, september, 1877, the, following, month, initial, contracts, were, awarded, for, the, suspender, wires, which, would, hang, down, from, the, main, cables, and, support, the, deck, by, may, 1878, the, main, cables, were, more, than, two, thirds, complete, however, the, following, month, one, of, the, wires, slipped, killing, two, people, and, injuring, three, others, in, 1877, hewitt, wrote, a, letter, urging, against, the, use, of, bessemer, steel, in, the, bridge, s, construction, bids, had, been, submitted, for, both, crucible, steel, and, bessemer, steel, john, a, roebling, s, sons, submitted, the, lowest, bid, for, bessemer, steel, but, at, hewitt, s, direction, the, contract, was, awarded, to, haigh, a, subsequent, investigation, discovered, that, haigh, had, substituted, inferior, quality, wire, in, the, cables, of, eighty, rings, of, wire, that, were, tested, only, five, met, standards, and, it, was, estimated, that, haigh, had, earned, 300, 000, from, the, deception, at, this, point, it, was, too, late, to, replace, the, cables, that, had, already, been, constructed, roebling, determined, that, the, poorer, wire, would, leave, the, bridge, only, four, times, as, strong, as, necessary, rather, than, six, to, eight, times, as, strong, the, inferior, quality, wire, was, allowed, to, remain, and, 150, extra, wires, were, added, to, each, cable, to, avoid, public, controversy, haigh, was, not, fired, but, instead, was, required, to, personally, pay, for, higher, quality, wire, the, contract, for, the, remaining, wire, was, awarded, to, the, john, a, roebling, s, sons, and, by, october, 5, 1878, the, last, of, the, main, cables, wires, went, over, the, river, after, the, suspender, wires, had, been, placed, workers, began, erecting, steel, crossbeams, to, support, the, roadway, as, part, of, the, bridge, s, overall, superstructure, construction, on, the, bridge, s, superstructure, started, in, march, 1879, but, as, with, the, cables, the, trustees, initially, disagreed, on, whether, the, steel, superstructure, should, be, made, of, bessemer, or, crucible, steel, that, july, the, trustees, decided, to, award, a, contract, for, 500, short, tons, 450, long, tons, of, bessemer, steel, to, the, edgemoor, or, edge, moor, iron, works, based, in, philadelphia, to, be, delivered, by, 1880, the, trustees, later, passed, another, resolution, for, another, 500, short, tons, 450, long, tons, of, bessemer, steel, however, by, february, 1880, the, steel, deliveries, had, not, started, that, october, the, bridge, trustees, questioned, edgemoor, s, president, about, the, delay, in, steel, deliveries, despite, edgemoor, s, assurances, that, the, contract, would, be, fulfilled, the, deliveries, still, had, not, been, completed, by, november, 1881, brooklyn, mayor, seth, low, who, became, part, of, the, board, of, trustees, in, 1882, became, the, chairman, of, a, committee, tasked, to, investigate, edgemoor, s, failure, to, fulfill, the, contract, when, questioned, edgemoor, s, president, stated, that, the, delays, were, the, fault, of, another, contractor, the, cambria, iron, company, who, was, manufacturing, the, eyebars, for, the, bridge, trusses, at, that, point, the, contract, was, supposed, to, be, complete, by, october, 1882, further, complicating, the, situation, washington, roebling, had, failed, to, appear, at, the, trustees, meeting, in, june, 1882, since, he, had, gone, to, newport, rhode, island, after, the, news, media, discovered, this, most, of, the, newspapers, called, for, roebling, to, be, fired, as, chief, engineer, except, for, the, daily, state, gazette, of, trenton, new, jersey, and, the, brooklyn, daily, eagle, some, of, the, longstanding, trustees, including, henry, c, murphy, james, s, t, stranahan, and, william, c, kingsley, were, willing, to, vouch, for, roebling, since, construction, progress, on, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, still, ongoing, however, roebling, s, behavior, was, considered, suspect, among, the, younger, trustees, who, had, joined, the, board, more, recently, construction, on, the, bridge, itself, was, noted, in, formal, reports, that, murphy, presented, each, month, to, the, mayors, of, new, york, and, brooklyn, for, example, murphy, s, report, in, august, 1882, noted, that, the, month, s, progress, included, 114, intermediate, cords, erected, within, a, week, as, well, as, 72, diagonal, stays, 60, posts, and, numerous, floor, beams, bridging, trusses, and, stay, bars, by, early, 1883, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, considered, mostly, completed, and, was, projected, to, open, that, june, contracts, for, bridge, lighting, were, awarded, by, february, 1883, and, a, toll, scheme, was, approved, that, march, there, was, substantial, opposition, to, the, bridge, s, construction, from, shipbuilders, and, merchants, located, to, the, north, who, argued, that, the, bridge, would, not, provide, sufficient, clearance, underneath, for, ships, in, may, 1876, these, groups, led, by, abraham, miller, filed, a, lawsuit, in, the, united, states, district, court, for, the, southern, district, of, new, york, against, the, cities, of, new, york, and, brooklyn, in, 1879, an, assembly, sub, committee, on, commerce, and, navigation, began, an, investigation, into, the, brooklyn, bridge, a, seaman, who, had, been, hired, to, determine, the, height, of, the, span, testified, to, the, committee, about, the, difficulties, that, ship, masters, would, experience, in, bringing, their, ships, under, the, bridge, when, it, was, completed, another, witness, edward, wellman, serrell, a, civil, engineer, said, that, the, calculations, of, the, bridge, s, assumed, strength, were, incorrect, the, supreme, court, decided, in, 1883, that, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, a, lawful, structure, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, was, opened, for, use, on, may, 24, 1883, thousands, of, people, attended, the, opening, ceremony, and, many, ships, were, present, in, the, east, river, for, the, occasion, officially, emily, warren, roebling, was, the, first, to, cross, the, bridge, the, bridge, opening, was, also, attended, by, u, s, president, chester, a, arthur, and, new, york, mayor, franklin, edson, who, crossed, the, bridge, and, shook, hands, with, brooklyn, mayor, seth, low, at, the, brooklyn, end, abram, hewitt, gave, the, principal, address, it, is, not, the, work, of, any, one, man, or, of, any, one, age, it, is, the, result, of, the, study, of, the, experience, and, of, the, knowledge, of, many, men, in, many, ages, it, is, not, merely, a, creation, it, is, a, growth, it, stands, before, us, today, as, the, sum, and, epitome, of, human, knowledge, as, the, very, heir, of, the, ages, as, the, latest, glory, of, centuries, of, patient, observation, profound, study, and, accumulated, skill, gained, step, by, step, in, the, never, ending, struggle, of, man, to, subdue, the, forces, of, nature, to, his, control, and, use, though, washington, roebling, was, unable, to, attend, the, ceremony, and, rarely, visited, the, site, again, he, held, a, celebratory, banquet, at, his, house, on, the, day, of, the, bridge, opening, further, festivity, included, the, performance, by, a, band, gunfire, from, ships, and, a, fireworks, display, on, that, first, day, a, total, of, 1, 800, vehicles, and, 150, 300, people, crossed, the, span, less, than, a, week, after, the, brooklyn, bridge, opened, ferry, crews, reported, a, sharp, drop, in, patronage, while, the, bridge, s, toll, operators, were, processing, over, a, hundred, people, a, minute, however, cross, river, ferries, continued, to, operate, until, 1942, the, bridge, had, cost, us, 15, 5, million, in, 1883, dollars, about, us, 490, 500, 000, in, 2023, to, build, of, which, brooklyn, paid, two, thirds, the, bonds, to, fund, the, construction, would, not, be, paid, off, until, 1956, an, estimated, 27, men, died, during, its, construction, since, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, was, the, only, bridge, across, the, east, river, at, that, time, it, was, also, called, the, east, river, bridge, until, the, construction, of, the, nearby, williamsburg, bridge, in, 1903, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, was, the, longest, suspension, bridge, in, the, world, 20, longer, than, any, built, previously, at, the, time, of, opening, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, not, complete, the, proposed, public, transit, across, the, bridge, was, still, being, tested, while, the, brooklyn, approach, was, being, completed, on, may, 30, 1883, six, days, after, the, opening, a, woman, falling, down, a, stairway, at, the, brooklyn, approach, caused, a, stampede, which, resulted, in, at, least, twelve, people, being, crushed, and, killed, in, subsequent, lawsuits, the, brooklyn, bridge, company, was, acquitted, of, negligence, however, the, company, did, install, emergency, phone, boxes, and, additional, railings, and, the, trustees, approved, a, fireproofing, plan, for, the, bridge, public, transit, service, began, with, the, opening, of, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, railway, a, cable, car, service, on, september, 25, 1883, on, may, 17, 1884, one, of, the, circus, master, p, t, barnum, s, most, famous, attractions, jumbo, the, elephant, led, a, parade, of, 21, elephants, over, the, brooklyn, bridge, this, helped, to, lessen, doubts, about, the, bridge, s, stability, while, also, promoting, barnum, s, circus, patronage, across, the, brooklyn, bridge, increased, in, the, years, after, it, opened, a, million, people, paid, to, cross, in, the, six, first, months, the, bridge, carried, 8, 5, million, people, in, 1884, its, first, full, year, of, operation, this, number, doubled, to, 17, million, in, 1885, and, again, to, 34, million, in, 1889, many, of, these, people, were, cable, car, passengers, additionally, about, 4, 5, million, pedestrians, a, year, were, crossing, the, bridge, for, free, by, 1892, the, first, proposal, to, make, changes, to, the, bridge, was, sent, in, only, two, and, a, half, years, after, it, opened, when, linda, gilbert, suggested, glass, steam, powered, elevators, and, an, observatory, be, added, to, the, bridge, and, a, fee, charged, for, use, which, would, in, part, fund, the, bridge, s, upkeep, and, in, part, fund, her, prison, reform, charity, this, proposal, was, considered, but, not, acted, upon, numerous, other, proposals, were, made, during, the, first, fifty, years, of, the, bridge, s, life, trolley, tracks, were, added, in, the, center, lanes, of, both, roadways, in, 1898, allowing, trolleys, to, use, the, bridge, as, well, that, year, the, formerly, separate, city, of, brooklyn, was, unified, with, new, york, city, and, the, brooklyn, bridge, fell, under, city, control, concerns, about, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, safety, were, raised, during, the, turn, of, the, century, in, 1898, traffic, backups, due, to, a, dead, horse, caused, one, of, the, truss, cords, to, buckle, there, were, more, significant, worries, after, twelve, suspender, cables, snapped, in, 1901, though, a, thorough, investigation, found, no, other, defects, after, the, 1901, incident, five, inspectors, were, hired, to, examine, the, bridge, each, day, a, service, that, cost, 250, 000, a, year, the, brooklyn, rapid, transit, company, which, operated, routes, across, the, brooklyn, bridge, issued, a, notice, in, 1905, saying, that, the, bridge, had, reached, its, transit, capacity, by, 1890, due, to, the, popularity, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, there, were, proposals, to, construct, other, bridges, across, the, east, river, between, manhattan, and, long, island, although, a, second, deck, for, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, proposed, it, was, thought, to, be, infeasible, because, doing, so, would, overload, the, bridge, s, structural, capacity, the, first, new, bridge, across, the, east, river, the, williamsburg, bridge, opened, upstream, in, 1903, and, connected, williamsburg, brooklyn, with, the, lower, east, side, of, manhattan, this, was, followed, by, the, queensboro, bridge, between, queens, and, manhattan, in, march, 1909, and, the, manhattan, bridge, between, brooklyn, and, manhattan, in, december, 1909, several, subway, railroad, and, road, tunnels, were, also, constructed, which, helped, to, accelerate, the, development, of, manhattan, brooklyn, and, queens, though, carriages, and, cable, car, customers, had, paid, tolls, ever, since, the, bridge, s, opening, pedestrians, were, spared, from, the, tolls, originally, by, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, pedestrians, were, also, paying, tolls, tolls, on, all, four, bridges, across, the, east, river, the, brooklyn, bridge, as, well, as, the, manhattan, williamsburg, and, queensboro, bridges, to, the, north, were, abolished, in, july, 1911, as, part, of, a, populist, policy, initiative, headed, by, new, york, city, mayor, william, jay, gaynor, the, city, government, passed, a, bill, to, officially, name, the, structure, the, brooklyn, bridge, in, january, 1915, ostensibly, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, traffic, on, nearby, city, streets, grover, whalen, the, commissioner, of, plant, and, structures, banned, motor, vehicles, from, the, brooklyn, bridge, in, july, 1922, the, real, reason, for, the, ban, was, an, incident, the, same, year, where, two, cables, slipped, due, to, high, traffic, loads, both, whalen, and, roebling, called, for, the, renovation, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, and, the, construction, of, a, parallel, bridge, though, the, parallel, bridge, was, never, built, whalen, s, successor, william, wirt, mills, announced, in, 1924, that, a, new, wood, block, pavement, would, be, installed, permitting, motor, vehicles, to, use, the, bridge, again, motor, traffic, was, again, allowed, on, the, bridge, starting, on, may, 12, 1925, as, part, of, an, experiment, starting, in, november, 1946, the, manhattan, bound, roadway, carried, brooklyn, bound, traffic, during, the, evening, rush, hours, the, experiment, ended, after, two, months, due, to, complaints, about, congestion, the, first, major, upgrade, to, the, brooklyn, bridge, commenced, in, 1948, when, a, contract, to, entirely, reconstruct, the, approach, ramps, was, awarded, to, david, b, steinman, the, renovation, was, expected, to, double, the, capacity, of, the, bridge, s, roadways, to, nearly, 6, 000, cars, per, hour, at, a, projected, cost, of, 7, million, the, renovation, included, the, demolition, of, both, the, elevated, and, the, trolley, tracks, on, the, roadways, the, removal, of, trusses, separating, the, inner, elevated, tracks, from, the, existing, vehicle, lanes, and, the, widening, of, each, roadway, from, two, to, three, lanes, as, well, as, the, construction, of, a, new, steel, and, concrete, floor, in, addition, new, ramps, were, added, to, adams, street, cadman, plaza, and, the, brooklyn, queens, expressway, bqe, on, the, brooklyn, side, and, to, park, row, on, the, manhattan, side, the, bridge, was, briefly, closed, to, all, traffic, for, the, first, time, ever, in, january, 1950, and, the, trolley, tracks, closed, that, march, to, allow, the, widening, work, to, occur, during, the, construction, project, one, roadway, at, a, time, was, closed, allowing, reduced, traffic, flows, to, cross, the, bridge, in, one, direction, only, the, widened, south, roadway, was, completed, in, may, 1951, followed, by, the, north, roadway, in, october, 1953, the, restoration, was, finished, in, may, 1954, with, the, completion, of, the, reconstructed, elevated, promenade, while, the, rebuilding, of, the, span, was, ongoing, a, fallout, shelter, was, constructed, beneath, the, manhattan, approach, in, anticipation, of, the, cold, war, the, abandoned, space, in, one, of, the, masonry, arches, was, stocked, with, emergency, survival, supplies, for, a, potential, nuclear, attack, by, the, soviet, union, these, supplies, remained, in, place, half, a, century, later, in, addition, defensive, barriers, were, added, to, the, bridge, as, a, safeguard, against, sabotage, simultaneous, with, the, rebuilding, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, a, double, decked, viaduct, for, the, bqe, was, being, built, through, an, existing, steel, overpass, of, the, bridge, s, brooklyn, approach, ramp, the, segment, of, the, bqe, from, brooklyn, bridge, south, to, atlantic, avenue, opened, in, june, 1954, but, the, direct, ramp, from, the, northbound, bqe, to, the, manhattan, bound, brooklyn, bridge, did, not, open, until, 1959, the, city, also, widened, the, adams, street, approach, in, brooklyn, between, the, bridge, and, fulton, street, from, 60, to, 160, feet, 18, to, 49, m, between, 1954, and, 1955, subsequently, boerum, place, from, fulton, street, south, to, atlantic, avenue, was, also, widened, this, required, the, demolition, of, the, old, kings, county, courthouse, the, towers, were, cleaned, in, 1958, and, the, brooklyn, anchorage, was, repaired, the, next, year, on, the, manhattan, side, the, city, approved, a, controversial, rebuilding, of, the, manhattan, entrance, plaza, in, 1953, the, project, which, would, add, a, grade, separated, junction, over, park, row, was, hotly, contested, because, it, would, require, the, demolition, of, 21, structures, including, the, old, new, york, world, building, the, reconstruction, also, necessitated, the, relocation, of, 410, families, on, park, row, in, december, 1956, the, city, started, a, two, year, renovation, of, the, plaza, this, required, the, closure, of, one, roadway, at, a, time, as, was, done, during, the, rebuilding, of, the, bridge, itself, work, on, redeveloping, the, area, around, the, manhattan, approach, started, in, the, mid, 1960s, at, the, same, time, plans, were, announced, for, direct, ramps, to, the, fdr, drive, elevated, highway, to, alleviate, congestion, at, the, approach, the, ramp, from, the, fdr, drive, to, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, opened, in, 1968, followed, by, the, ramp, from, the, bridge, to, the, fdr, drive, the, next, year, a, single, ramp, from, the, manhattan, bound, brooklyn, bridge, to, northbound, park, row, was, constructed, in, 1970, a, repainting, of, the, bridge, was, announced, two, years, later, in, advance, of, its, 90th, anniversary, the, brooklyn, bridge, gradually, deteriorated, due, to, age, and, neglect, while, it, had, 200, full, time, dedicated, maintenance, workers, before, world, war, ii, that, number, dropped, to, five, by, the, late, 20th, century, and, the, city, as, a, whole, only, had, 160, bridge, maintenance, workers, in, 1974, heavy, vehicles, such, as, vans, and, buses, were, banned, from, the, bridge, to, prevent, further, erosion, of, the, concrete, roadway, a, report, in, the, new, york, times, four, years, later, noted, that, the, cables, were, visibly, fraying, and, the, pedestrian, promenade, had, holes, in, it, the, city, began, planning, to, replace, all, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, cables, at, a, cost, of, 115, million, as, part, of, a, larger, project, to, renovate, all, four, toll, free, east, river, spans, by, 1980, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, in, such, dire, condition, that, it, faced, imminent, closure, in, some, places, half, of, the, strands, in, the, cables, were, broken, in, june, 1981, two, of, the, diagonal, stay, cables, snapped, killing, a, pedestrian, subsequently, the, anchorages, were, found, to, have, developed, rust, and, an, emergency, cable, repair, was, necessitated, less, than, a, month, later, after, another, cable, developed, slack, following, the, incident, the, city, accelerated, the, timetable, of, its, proposed, cable, replacement, and, it, commenced, a, 153, million, rehabilitation, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, in, advance, of, the, 100th, anniversary, as, part, of, the, project, the, bridge, s, original, suspender, cables, installed, by, j, lloyd, haigh, were, replaced, by, bethlehem, steel, in, 1986, marking, the, cables, first, replacement, since, construction, in, addition, the, staircase, at, washington, street, in, brooklyn, was, renovated, the, stairs, from, tillary, and, adams, streets, were, replaced, with, a, ramp, and, the, short, flights, of, steps, from, the, promenade, to, each, tower, s, balcony, were, removed, in, a, smaller, project, the, bridge, was, floodlit, at, night, starting, in, 1982, to, highlight, its, architectural, features, additional, problems, persisted, and, in, 1993, high, levels, of, lead, were, discovered, near, the, bridge, s, towers, further, emergency, repairs, were, undertaken, in, mid, 1999, after, small, concrete, shards, began, falling, from, the, bridge, into, the, east, river, the, concrete, deck, had, been, installed, during, the, 1950s, renovations, and, had, a, lifespan, of, about, 60, years, the, park, row, exit, from, the, bridge, s, westbound, lanes, was, closed, as, a, safety, measure, after, the, september, 11, 2001, attacks, on, the, nearby, world, trade, center, that, section, of, park, row, had, been, closed, off, since, it, ran, right, underneath, 1, police, plaza, the, headquarters, of, the, new, york, city, police, department, nypd, in, early, 2003, to, save, money, on, electricity, the, nycdot, turned, off, the, bridge, s, necklace, lights, at, night, they, were, turned, back, on, later, that, year, after, several, private, entities, made, donations, to, fund, the, lights, after, the, 2007, collapse, of, the, i, 35w, bridge, in, minneapolis, public, attention, focused, on, the, condition, of, bridges, across, the, u, s, the, new, york, times, reported, that, the, brooklyn, bridge, approach, ramps, had, received, a, poor, rating, during, an, inspection, in, 2007, however, a, nycdot, spokesman, said, that, the, poor, rating, did, not, indicate, a, dangerous, state, but, rather, implied, it, required, renovation, in, 2010, the, nycdot, began, renovating, the, approaches, and, deck, as, well, as, repainting, the, suspension, span, work, included, widening, two, approach, ramps, from, one, to, two, lanes, by, re, striping, a, new, prefabricated, ramp, raising, clearance, over, the, eastbound, bqe, at, york, street, seismic, retrofitting, replacement, of, rusted, railings, and, safety, barriers, and, road, deck, resurfacing, the, work, necessitated, detours, for, four, years, at, the, time, the, project, was, scheduled, to, be, completed, in, 2014, but, completion, was, later, delayed, to, 2015, then, again, to, 2017, the, project, s, cost, also, increased, from, 508, million, in, 2010, to, 811, million, in, 2016, in, august, 2016, the, nycdot, announced, that, it, would, conduct, a, seven, month, 370, 000, study, to, verify, if, the, bridge, could, support, a, heavier, upper, deck, that, consisted, of, an, expanded, bicycle, and, pedestrian, path, by, then, about, 10, 000, pedestrians, and, 3, 500, cyclists, used, the, pathway, on, an, average, weekday, work, on, the, pedestrian, entrance, on, the, brooklyn, side, was, underway, by, 2017, the, nycdot, also, indicated, in, 2016, that, it, planned, to, reinforce, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, foundations, to, prevent, it, from, sinking, as, well, as, repair, the, masonry, arches, on, the, approach, ramps, which, had, been, damaged, by, hurricane, sandy, four, years, earlier, in, july, 2018, the, new, york, city, landmarks, preservation, commission, approved, a, further, renovation, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, suspension, towers, and, approach, ramps, that, december, the, federal, government, gave, the, city, 25, million, in, funding, which, would, pay, for, a, 337, million, rehabilitation, of, the, bridge, approaches, and, the, suspension, towers, work, started, in, late, 2019, and, was, scheduled, to, be, completed, in, four, years, this, restoration, included, removing, bricks, from, the, arches, and, putting, fresh, concrete, behind, them, using, mortar, from, the, same, upstate, quarries, as, the, original, mortar, the, granite, arches, were, also, cleaned, revealing, the, original, gray, color, of, the, stone, which, had, long, been, hidden, by, grime, additionally, 56, led, lamps, were, installed, on, the, bridge, at, a, cost, of, 2, 4, million, in, early, 2020, city, council, speaker, corey, johnson, and, the, nonprofit, van, alen, institute, hosted, an, international, contest, to, solicit, plans, for, the, redesign, of, the, bridge, s, walkway, ultimately, in, january, 2021, the, city, decided, to, install, a, two, way, protected, bike, path, on, the, manhattan, bound, roadway, replacing, the, leftmost, vehicular, lane, the, bike, lane, would, allow, the, existing, promenade, to, be, used, exclusively, by, pedestrians, work, on, the, bike, lane, started, in, june, 2021, and, the, new, path, was, completed, on, september, 14, 2021, despite, the, addition, of, the, bike, path, the, bridge, s, walkway, was, still, frequently, overcrowded, prompting, the, city, to, propose, in, mid, 2023, that, street, vendors, be, banned, from, the, bridge, and, others, citywide, all, vendors, were, banned, from, the, bridge, at, the, beginning, of, january, 2024, the, same, month, the, bridge, s, new, led, lights, were, illuminated, for, the, first, time, a, plan, for, congestion, pricing, in, new, york, city, was, approved, in, mid, 2023, allowing, the, metropolitan, transportation, authority, to, toll, drivers, who, use, the, brooklyn, bridge, and, then, travel, on, local, streets, congestion, pricing, is, indefinitely, postponed, as, of, 2024, if, congestion, pricing, is, implemented, most, traffic, to, and, from, the, fdr, drive, would, be, exempt, from, the, toll, horse, drawn, carriages, have, been, allowed, to, use, the, brooklyn, bridge, s, roadways, since, its, opening, originally, each, of, the, two, roadways, carried, two, lanes, of, a, different, direction, of, traffic, the, lanes, were, relatively, narrow, at, only, 8, feet, 2, 4, m, wide, in, july, 1922, motor, vehicles, were, banned, from, the, bridge, the, ban, lasted, until, may, 1925, after, 1950, the, main, roadway, carried, six, lanes, of, automobile, traffic, three, in, each, direction, it, was, then, reduced, to, five, lanes, with, the, addition, of, a, two, way, bike, lane, on, the, manhattan, bound, side, in, 2021, because, of, the, roadway, s, height, 11, ft, 3, 4, m, posted, and, weight, 6, 000, lb, 2, 700, kg, posted, restrictions, commercial, vehicles, and, buses, are, prohibited, from, using, the, brooklyn, bridge, the, weight, restrictions, prohibit, heavy, passenger, vehicles, such, as, pickup, trucks, and, suvs, from, using, the, bridge, though, this, is, not, often, enforced, in, practice, on, the, brooklyn, side, vehicles, can, enter, the, bridge, from, tillary, adams, streets, to, the, south, sands, pearl, streets, to, the, west, and, exit, 28b, of, the, eastbound, brooklyn, queens, expressway, in, manhattan, cars, can, enter, from, both, the, northbound, and, southbound, fdr, drive, as, well, as, park, row, to, the, west, chambers, centre, streets, to, the, north, and, pearl, street, to, the, south, however, the, exit, from, the, bridge, to, northbound, park, row, was, closed, after, the, september, 11, attacks, because, of, increased, security, concerns, that, section, of, park, row, ran, under, one, police, plaza, the, nypd, headquarters, vehicular, access, to, the, bridge, is, provided, by, a, complex, series, of, ramps, on, both, sides, of, the, bridge, there, are, two, entrances, to, the, bridge, s, pedestrian, promenade, on, either, side, the, current, configuration, was, constructed, from, the, mid, 1950s, up, until, the, early, 1970s, after, 9, 11, the, ramp, onto, park, row, was, restricted, to, public, traffic, there, are, no, plans, to, reopen, it, all, exits, are, unnumbered, formerly, rail, traffic, operated, on, the, brooklyn, bridge, as, well, cable, cars, and, elevated, railroads, used, the, bridge, until, 1944, while, trolleys, ran, until, 1950, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, railway, a, cable, car, service, began, operating, on, september, 25, 1883, it, ran, on, the, inner, lanes, of, the, bridge, between, terminals, at, the, manhattan, and, brooklyn, ends, since, washington, roebling, believed, that, steam, locomotives, would, put, excessive, loads, upon, the, structure, of, the, brooklyn, bridge, the, cable, car, line, was, designed, as, a, steam, cable, hauled, hybrid, they, were, powered, from, a, generating, station, under, the, brooklyn, approach, the, cable, cars, could, not, only, regulate, their, speed, on, the, 3, 3, 4, upward, and, downward, approaches, but, also, maintain, a, constant, interval, between, each, other, there, were, 24, cable, cars, in, total, initially, the, service, ran, with, single, car, trains, but, patronage, soon, grew, so, much, that, by, october, 1883, two, car, trains, were, in, use, the, line, carried, three, million, people, in, the, first, six, months, nine, million, in, 1884, and, nearly, 20, million, in, 1885, following, the, opening, of, the, brooklyn, union, elevated, railroad, accordingly, the, track, layout, was, rearranged, and, more, trains, were, ordered, at, the, same, time, there, were, highly, controversial, plans, to, extend, the, elevated, railroads, onto, the, brooklyn, bridge, under, the, pretext, of, extending, the, bridge, itself, after, disputes, the, trustees, agreed, to, build, two, elevated, routes, to, the, bridge, on, the, brooklyn, side, patronage, continued, to, increase, and, in, 1888, the, tracks, were, lengthened, and, even, more, cars, were, constructed, to, allow, for, four, car, cable, car, trains, electric, wires, for, the, trolleys, were, added, by, 1895, allowing, for, the, potential, future, decommissioning, of, the, steam, cable, system, the, terminals, were, rebuilt, once, more, in, july, 1895, and, following, the, implementation, of, new, electric, cars, in, late, 1896, the, steam, engines, were, dismantled, and, sold, following, the, unification, of, the, cities, of, new, york, and, brooklyn, in, 1898, the, new, york, and, brooklyn, bridge, railway, ceased, to, be, a, separate, entity, that, june, and, the, brooklyn, rapid, transit, company, brt, assumed, control, of, the, line, the, brt, started, running, through, services, of, elevated, trains, which, ran, from, park, row, terminal, in, manhattan, to, points, in, brooklyn, via, the, sands, street, station, on, the, brooklyn, side, before, reaching, sands, street, at, tillary, street, for, fulton, street, line, trains, and, at, bridge, street, for, fifth, avenue, line, and, myrtle, avenue, line, trains, elevated, trains, bound, for, manhattan, were, uncoupled, from, their, steam, locomotives, the, elevated, trains, were, then, coupled, to, the, cable, cars, which, would, pull, the, passenger, carriages, across, the, bridge, the, brt, did, not, run, any, elevated, train, through, services, from, 1899, to, 1901, due, to, increased, patronage, after, the, opening, of, the, interborough, rapid, transit, company, irt, s, first, subway, line, the, park, row, station, was, rebuilt, in, 1906, in, the, early, 20th, century, there, were, plans, for, brooklyn, bridge, elevated, trains, to, run, underground, to, the, brt, s, proposed, chambers, street, station, in, manhattan, though, the, connection, was, never, opened, the, overpass, across, william, street, was, closed, in, 1913, to, make, way, for, the, proposed, connection, in, 1929, the, overpass, was, reopened, after, it, became, clear, that, the, connection, would, not, be, built, after, the, irt, s, joralemon, street, tunnel, and, the, williamsburg, bridge, tracks, opened, in, 1908, the, brooklyn, bridge, no, longer, held, a, monopoly, on, rail, service, between, manhattan, and, brooklyn, and, cable, service, ceased, new, subway, lines, from, the, irt, and, from, the, brt, s, successor, brooklyn, manhattan, transit, corporation, bmt, built, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, posed, significant, competition, to, the, brooklyn, bridge, rail, services, with, the, opening, of, the, independent, subway, system, in, 1932, and, the, subsequent, unification, of, all, three, companies, into, a, single, entity, in, 1940, the, elevated, services, started, to, decline, and, the, park, row, and, sands, street, stations, were, greatly, reduced, in, size, the, fifth, avenue, and, fulton, street, services, across, the, brooklyn, bridge, were, discontinued, in, 1940, and, 1941, respectively, and, the, elevated, tracks, were, abandoned, permanently, with, the, withdrawal, of, myrtle, avenue, services, in, 1944, a, plan, for, trolley, service, across, the, brooklyn, bridge, was, presented, in, 1895, two, years, later, the, brooklyn, bridge, trustees, agreed, to, a, plan, where, trolleys, could, run, across, the, bridge, under, ten, year, contracts, trolley, service, which, began, in, 1898, ran, on, what, are, now, the, two, middle, lanes, of, each, roadway, shared, with, other, traffic, when, cable, service, was, withdrawn, in, 1908, the, trolley, tracks, on, the, brooklyn, side, were, rebuilt, to, alleviate, congestion, trolley, service, on, the, middle, lanes, continued, until, the, elevated, lines, stopped, using, the, bridge, in, 1944, when, they, moved, to, the, protected, center, tracks, on, march, 5, 1950, the, streetcars, also, stopped, running, and, the, bridge, was, redesigned, exclusively, for, automobile, traffic, the, brooklyn, bridge, has, an, elevated, promenade, open, to, pedestrians, in, the, center, of, the, bridge, located, 18, feet, 5, 5, m, above, the, automobile, lanes, the, promenade, is, usually, located, 4, feet, 1, 2, m, below, the, height, of, the, girders, except, at, the, approach, ramps, leading, to, each, tower, s, balcony, the, path, is, generally, 10, to, 17, feet, 3, 0, to, 5, 2, m, wide, though, this, is, constrained, by, obstacles, such, as, protruding, cables, benches, and, stairways, which, create, pinch, points, at, certain, locations, the, path, narrows, to, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, at, the, locations, where, the, main, cables, descend, to, the, level, of, the, promenade, further, exacerbating, the, situation, these, pinch, points, are, some, of, the, most, popular, places, to, take, pictures, as, a, result, in, 2016, the, nycdot, announced, that, it, planned, to, double, the, promenade, s, width, a, center, line, was, painted, to, separate, cyclists, from, pedestrians, in, 1971, creating, one, of, the, city, s, first, dedicated, bike, lanes, initially, the, northern, side, of, the, promenade, was, used, by, pedestrians, and, the, southern, side, by, cyclists, in, 2000, these, were, swapped, with, cyclists, taking, the, northern, side, and, pedestrians, taking, the, southern, side, on, september, 14, 2021, the, dot, closed, off, the, inner, most, car, lane, on, the, manhattan, bound, side, with, protective, barriers, and, fencing, to, create, a, new, bike, path, cyclists, are, now, prohibited, from, the, upper, pedestrian, lane, pedestrian, access, to, the, bridge, from, the, brooklyn, side, is, from, either, the, median, of, adams, street, at, its, intersection, with, tillary, street, or, a, staircase, near, prospect, street, between, cadman, plaza, east, and, west, in, manhattan, the, pedestrian, walkway, is, accessible, from, crosswalks, at, the, intersection, of, the, bridge, and, centre, street, or, through, a, staircase, leading, to, park, row, while, the, bridge, has, always, permitted, the, passage, of, pedestrians, the, promenade, facilitates, movement, when, other, means, of, crossing, the, east, river, have, become, unavailable, during, transit, strikes, by, the, transport, workers, union, in, 1980, and, 2005, people, commuting, to, work, used, the, bridge, they, were, joined, by, mayors, ed, koch, and, michael, bloomberg, who, crossed, as, a, gesture, to, the, affected, public, pedestrians, also, walked, across, the, bridge, as, an, alternative, to, suspended, subway, services, following, the, 1965, 1977, and, 2003, blackouts, and, after, the, september, 11, attacks, during, the, 2003, blackouts, many, crossing, the, bridge, reported, a, swaying, motion, the, higher, than, usual, pedestrian, load, caused, this, swaying, which, was, amplified, by, the, tendency, of, pedestrians, to, synchronize, their, footfalls, with, a, sway, several, engineers, expressed, concern, about, how, this, would, affect, the, bridge, although, others, noted, that, the, bridge, did, withstand, the, event, and, that, the, redundancies, in, its, design, the, inclusion, of, the, three, support, systems, suspension, system, diagonal, stay, system, and, stiffening, truss, make, it, probably, the, best, secured, bridge, against, such, movements, going, out, of, control, in, designing, the, bridge, john, roebling, had, stated, that, the, bridge, would, sag, but, not, fall, even, if, one, of, these, structural, systems, were, to, fail, altogether, there, have, been, several, notable, jumpers, from, the, brooklyn, bridge, the, first, person, was, robert, emmet, odlum, brother, of, women, s, rights, activist, charlotte, odlum, smith, on, may, 19, 1885, he, struck, the, water, at, an, angle, and, died, shortly, afterwards, from, internal, injuries, steve, brodie, supposedly, dropped, from, underneath, the, bridge, in, july, 1886, and, was, briefly, arrested, for, it, though, there, is, some, doubt, about, whether, he, actually, jumped, larry, donovan, made, a, slightly, higher, jump, from, the, railing, a, month, afterward, the, first, person, to, jump, from, the, bridge, with, the, intention, of, suicide, was, francis, mccarey, in, 1892, a, lesser, known, early, jumper, was, james, duffy, of, county, cavan, ireland, who, on, april, 15, 1895, asked, several, men, to, watch, him, jump, from, the, bridge, duffy, jumped, and, was, not, seen, again, additionally, the, cartoonist, otto, eppers, jumped, and, survived, in, 1910, and, was, then, tried, and, acquitted, for, attempted, suicide, the, brooklyn, bridge, has, since, developed, a, reputation, as, a, suicide, bridge, due, to, the, number, of, jumpers, who, do, so, intending, to, kill, themselves, though, exact, statistics, are, difficult, to, find, other, notable, feats, have, taken, place, on, or, near, the, bridge, in, 1919, giorgio, pessi, piloted, what, was, then, one, of, the, world, s, largest, airplanes, the, caproni, ca, 5, under, the, bridge, in, 1993, bridge, jumper, thierry, devaux, illegally, performed, eight, acrobatic, bungee, jumps, above, the, east, river, close, to, the, brooklyn, tower, on, march, 1, 1994, lebanese, born, rashid, baz, opened, fire, on, a, van, carrying, members, of, the, chabad, lubavitch, orthodox, jewish, movement, striking, 16, year, old, student, ari, halberstam, and, three, others, traveling, on, the, bridge, halberstam, died, five, days, later, from, his, wounds, and, baz, was, later, convicted, of, murder, he, was, apparently, acting, out, of, revenge, for, the, hebron, massacre, of, palestinian, muslims, a, few, days, prior, to, the, incident, after, initially, classifying, the, killing, as, one, committed, out, of, road, rage, the, justice, department, reclassified, the, case, in, 2000, as, a, terrorist, attack, the, entrance, ramp, to, the, bridge, on, the, manhattan, side, was, dedicated, as, the, ari, halberstam, memorial, ramp, in, 1995, several, potential, attacks, or, disasters, have, also, been, averted, in, 1979, police, disarmed, a, stick, of, dynamite, placed, under, the, brooklyn, approach, and, an, artist, in, manhattan, was,

replace, violence, and, fear, in, mass, media, for, one, day, when, each, of, the, artists, had, reached, the, tops, of, the, bridges, they, ignited, bright, yellow, flares, at, the, same, moment, resulting, in, rush, hour, traffic, disruption, media, attention, and, the, arrest, of, the, climbers, though, the, charges, were, later, dropped, called, the, first, social, sculpture, to, use, mass,

receiver, gunpowder, and, fireworks, in, a, bucket, atop, one, of, the, towers, the, piece, was, later, discovered, by, police, leading, to, his, arrest, for, possessing, a, bomb, on, october, 1, 2011, more, than, 700, protesters, with, the, occupy, wall, street, movement, were, arrested, while, attempting, to, march, across, the, bridge, on, the, roadway, protesters, disputed, the, police,
